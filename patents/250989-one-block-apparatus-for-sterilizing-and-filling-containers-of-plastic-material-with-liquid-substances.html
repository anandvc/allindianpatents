				<td>Micro coating comprising siloxanes<br>
The invention relates to a binder and a coating composition, in particular for<br>
metal surfaces.<br>
Binders are an essential ingredient of coating compositions. They effect the<br>
coherence of the various components of a coating composition and contribute<br>
to the coating formation. The manufacture of coating compositions<br>
necessitates the employment of additives in conjunction with binders. The<br>
expression "additives" is used in the context of this invention for all additives<br>
to a binder which affect the properties of a coating composition, independent<br>
of the amount in which the additives are added.<br>
Coating compositions which include a binder and, as an additive, a particulate<br>
metal are known. These compositions are also referred to as base-coat and<br>
provide undercoats which may then be coated with lacquers, so-called top-<br>
coats. In the following, important literature is cited forming part of the state of<br>
the art for such base coats:<br>
US 6,287,372 (Themec Company Incorporated, 2000)<br>
Here a zinc coating is described for corrosion protection. A siloxane-polymer<br>
resin is described serving as a binder, more accurately: a pre-hydrolized<br>
inorganic alkyl-silicate-compound such as Silbond XHT33. In the specification<br>
it is mentioned that alkyl-silicates are preferred, but that it is assumed that<br>
other siloxane polymer resins may be employed equally well. The<br>
compositions mentioned contain solvents, as a consequence of which, when<br>
processing, and in particular when drying the coating, volatile compounds are<br>
liberated.<br>
US 5,477,918 (United Technologies Corporation)<br>
A formulation for an aqueous anti-corrosion agent is described. The binder<br>
employed in the formulation is a silicone resin emulsion which is not water<br>
soluble. The binder must be compounded with an emulsifier in order to be<br>
able to produce an aqueous anti-corrosive agent. The anti-corrosive agent<br><br>
liberates up to 200 g/L of volatile substances, even in aqueous solutions. This<br>
is, therefore, not a purely aqueous formulation. The liberation of volatile<br>
substances is not prevented to an adequate degree.<br>
US 4,218,354 (Stauffer Chemical Company)<br>
A solvent containing anti-corrosive agent based on pre-hydrolized organic<br>
siloxane compounds, compounded with metal particles is proposed. This<br>
concerns an anti-corrosive agent which is usually produced with sub-<br>
stochiometrically amounts of water for the formation of a siloxane condensate,<br>
but which is soluble only in the acid pH-range and - according to Claim 1 -<br>
only in the presence of organic solvents. Although in this manner the<br>
liberation of volatile components during condensation of the monomers is<br>
prevented, the processing of the proposed anti-corrosive agent remains<br>
problematical because of the required organic solvent and does not comply<br>
with present day requirements any more.<br>
WO 94/09075 (Wacker Chemie)<br>
An aqueous anti-corrosive agent is proposed in WO94/09075. Pre-hydrolized<br>
silanes which, however, once again, are not water soluble, are introduced into<br>
water with the aid of emulsifying agents. It is a drawback of these anti-<br>
corrosive agents that the coatings based thereon are not particularly<br>
temperature-resistant. At 120 oC and beyond, the coating softens and the<br>
emulsifying agents contained therein, frequently tensides, act as plasticizers<br>
which intercalate with water. As a result the field of employment of this anti-<br>
corrosive agent is substantially restricted.<br>
DE 198 18 923 (Degussa-Huls AG)<br>
Water-soluble amino- and alkenyl-functional organosiloxanes are described<br>
which, after hydrolysis, when curing, no longer liberate alcohols. These<br>
organosiloxanes are employed for the coating of pigments. The coated<br>
pigments are then dried and used in various fields. The organosiloxanes<br>
described in this document are no cross-linkage formers. They are hydrophilic<br>
and, although suitable for the coating of pigments, they are not suitable for<br><br>
applications in which a good film formation or corrosion protection is<br>
important.<br>
It is an object of the invention to propose an aqueous binder which regarding<br>
the various applications thereof should be adjustable as much as possible in<br>
relation to the conditions of curing and a coating composition based on the<br>
use of this binder, in particular a corrosion protection composition which is<br>
substantially free of organic solvents and which cures without organic reaction<br>
products.<br>
This object is attained by a binder according to Claim 1. The binder according<br>
to the invention is aqueous which allows an environmentally friendly<br>
processibility in simple installations. The binder, moreover, is a film former so<br>
that it is suitable for use for coatings. By means of the binder according to the<br>
invention, coatings of a variety of coating thicknesses can be produced in a<br>
simple manner. The binder can be employed as a single layer but also in<br>
multiple layered coating structures as will be explained further below. The<br>
polymeric siloxane ensures stable coatings, an easy processibility and the<br>
compatibility with additives which are added to a binder in the manufacture of<br>
coating compositions.<br>
The polymeric siloxane employed according to the invention as a binder only<br>
includes a low content of alkoxy groups. It is preferably free of alkoxy groups,<br>
that is to say, the content of alkoxy groups is lower than 10 % by weight,<br>
preferably less than 5 % by weight, particularly preferably less than 2 % by<br>
weight, in each case based on the polymeric siloxane.<br>
Silanes including epoxy-, mercaptane- or hydroxy alkyl groups, are preferably<br>
employed for the manufacture of the polymeric siloxane, silanes containing<br>
mercaptane groups because of odour problems having a limited field of<br>
application. However, alkyl-, in particular alkenyl silanes may also be<br>
employed. Methacrylicsilanes are likewise suitable, in particular if the binder is<br>
to be cured with the aid of UV-light.<br><br>
The binder according to the invention may be structured as a homo- or<br>
hetero-polymer. In contrast to the state of the art it is preferred not to employ<br>
monomers as binder. Rather, the binder is composed predominantly of<br>
already condensed molecules. The monomer content is less than 10 % by<br>
weight based on the overall solids content of the binder, preferably less than 5<br>
% by weight, particularly preferably less than 3 % by weight, advantageously<br>
below 1 % by weight, in each case based on the overall solids content of the<br>
binder.<br>
It is a substantial advantage of the aforegoing features that, during curing of<br>
the binder, hardly any alcohols are split off. The proportion of the split off<br>
alcohol amounts to less than 10 % by weight based on the amount of binder,<br>
advantageously less than 5 % by weight, particularly advantageously less<br>
than 2 % by weight, in each case based on the amount of binder. Even<br>
though a binder is employed which has already been pre-hydrolized or pre-<br>
condensed, the reactivity of the polymeric siloxane is adequate, e.g., when<br>
using it as a binder, to stabilize and fix a base coat on the metallic substrate.<br>
The polymeric siloxane according to the invention is no longer present in its<br>
monomeric form, even though it has not been condensed to its gel point. In<br>
that condition it is excellently suitable for the coating of work pieces. Yet, the<br>
polymeric siloxane according to the invention is preferably water soluble<br>
without the addition of emulsifying agents.<br>
It is also preferred that the binder contains no acid added for catalysis. Acids,<br>
e.g. hydrochloric acids, are normally necessary according to the state of the<br>
art as catalyst for the production of binders from monomers. The production of<br>
the binder without he addition of acid is in particular of advantageous effect if<br>
the binder is employed in corrosion protection compositions because acids<br>
which may still be present in the cured coating, act hydrophyllically which is<br>
decidedly disadvantageous for corrosion protection.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention the silanes<br>
include particles having dimensions below 100 urn. Preferred are particles<br>
having a diameter of up to 50 urn, advantageously of up to 20 um, particularly<br><br>
advantageously of up to 10 urn, preferably the diameter of the particles is in<br>
the nanometer range, that is to say less than 1 µm. If the binder is employed<br>
either directly or as a component of coating compositions in very thin coating<br>
thicknesses, it may prove to be advantageous to employ particles having<br>
dimensions of less than 1 urn, preferably smaller than 55 nm, particularly<br>
preferred smaller than 10 nm, preferably smaller than 5 nm. Particles and<br>
monomelic silanes are mixed. The silanes hydrolize to polymeric siloxanes<br>
and envelop the particles so that a filled binder is formed in which the silanes,<br>
condensed to form polymeric siloxanes, envelop the particles.<br>
Particles may be employed which consist of silicon or which contain silicon, in<br>
particular silicon dioxides are employed which can be provided and employed,<br>
for example, in the form of silicasoles, siloxanes or polysilicates. Colloidal<br>
silicon dioxide or particulates silicic acid, also known an silicic soles are<br>
particularly suitable. E.g. hydrogen-, lithium, potassium or sodium polysilicates<br>
may be employed as polysilicates. In particular, modified silicic soles which<br>
are stable in the acid pH range are suitable for employment in the binder<br>
according to the invention. The modification of the surface is frequently<br>
attained by chelation of metals or metal salts to the silicic soles.<br>
However, other organic or inorganic particles may also be used. Preferably<br>
used are e.g. metal salts, -oxides or -alkoxides, in particular if they are<br>
available in suitable particle sizes. The particle sizes suitable for the use<br>
according to the invention may also be obtained in that the aforesaid metal<br>
salts, -oxides or -alkoxydes are mixed with carrier substrates. Advantageously<br>
employed may be aluminium-, titanium-, molybdenum-, zirconium-, yttrium-,<br>
niobium-, cerium- or lanthanium- compounds or mixtures of such compounds,<br>
optionally mixed with carrier substrates. Conventional corrosion protection<br>
pigments may also be employed, optionally in mixture with the aforesaid<br>
particles, e.g. phosphates, phosphonates, phosphides, in particular iron<br>
phosphides and/or molybdates. Conductive pigments, in particular/organic<br>
conductive pigments, e.g. silicon, preferably of wafer quality, nanotubes,<br>
carbon black, ICPs (intrinsic conductive polymers) may also be employed,<br>
optionally mixed with the aforesaid particles. The particles may, according to<br><br>
the invention, be employed in the following quantity ratios - based on<br>
whatever monomeric silane is employed on site for the particular manufacture<br>
of the binder - the molar ratio silane : particles may be adjusted to from 50 : 1<br>
up to 1 : 50, advantageously from 20: 1 up to 1 : 20, preferably from 10:1 up<br>
to 1 : 10, particularly preferred from 5 : 1 up to 1 : 5. According to a<br>
particularly suitable embodiment it lies in the range silane : particle 2 : 1 to 1 :<br>
2.<br>
A deciding factor for a preferred application of the binder for the use of<br>
corrosion protective agents is that the particles must be of a kind which, when<br>
using the binder in a coating composition, will act as little as possible<br>
hydrophylically after curing. In this context, in particular the afore described<br>
polysilicates were found to be very suitable.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the admixture or<br>
envelopment of particles with dimensions of less than 100 urn in the silanes<br>
results in a particularly dense, filled, film-forming binder, which is stable in<br>
aqueous solution. Depending on the requirements of various fields of<br>
application, organic solvents may also be admixed to the aqueous solution of<br>
the binder. When removing the solvent or solvent mixture respectively, the<br>
binder as well as any substances, which may be contained therein, will<br>
adhere to the surface of the substrate to be coated. The curing of the binder<br>
to completion requires in particular the total removal of the solvent, as a rule<br>
the removal of the water. This is in spite of the fact that chemical reactions, in<br>
particular condensation reactions, also contribute with the binder according to<br>
the invention to the attainment of a complete curing, however, to a far lesser<br>
extent than, e.g. when employing known binders which predominantly or<br>
exclusively rely on the employment of monomers. In this respect, in particular,<br>
the particular inventive quality of the binder is manifested: whereas, according<br>
to the state of the art, during complete curing, large amounts of alcohols are<br>
liberated, the binder according to the invention essentially only liberates water<br>
from condensation reactions. In that manner the liberation of in part toxic but<br>
in particular also flammable substances during curing, is avoided. The content<br>
of water and, where applicable, other solvents may be between 10 % by<br><br>
weight and 99,5% by weight, based on the overall formulation of the binder.<br>
Advantageously, the content of water and where applicable other solvents<br>
amounts to up to 90 % by weight, particularly advantageously up to 75 % by<br>
weight, preferably up to 50 % by weight, particularly preferably up to 30 % by<br>
weight.<br>
The binder according to the invention preferably only starts curing at<br>
temperatures which are clearly above room temperature. Measured here are<br>
object temperatures, that is to say the temperature is determined and given<br>
which is measured on the object to be coated. On the one hand, with elevated<br>
curing temperatures, the risk is avoided that, when employing the binder<br>
according to the invention in open dipping vessels, the curing of the binder<br>
already commences prior to the application on to a work piece or that, in the<br>
case of heaped small articles such as screws or the like, due to a premature<br>
curing, small coated work pieces stick together, so that no satisfactory coating<br>
is formed. On the other hand, the successive steps of application and curing<br>
of the binder can be better co-ordinated and controlled. It is preferred that the<br>
binder according to the invention cures at object temperatures of above 40 °C,<br>
preferably of above 80 °C, particularly preferably of above 150 oC,<br>
advantageously up to 300 oC, particularly advantageously up to 500 °C. The<br>
last mentioned curing temperatures above 150 oC are particularly of<br>
importance for applications in which an at least partial degradation of the<br>
organic components of the binder is tolerated. The aforesaid curing<br>
temperatures are applicable to an employment of the binder without any<br>
further additives but also to coating compositions manufactured with the aid of<br>
this binder.<br>
The binder may cure to completion very rapidly in about 1 second or very<br>
slowly in about 90 minutes. It is to be considered an advantage of the binder<br>
that the complete curing within a wide time frame can be adjusted. The<br>
adjustment of the time for complete curing may be adapted to the curing<br>
requirements of the processor, for example, by the manner in which the<br>
energy required for complete curing is applied, in a conventional convection<br>
oven, my means of UV-light or by induction. Alternatively, the time for<br><br>
complete curing of the binder may be influenced by the selection of the<br>
silanes employed in the manufacture of the binder or even by the addition of<br>
additives, typically high-boiling substances (solvents). The time for complete<br>
curing preferably amounts to between 2 and 60 minutes, preferably between 3<br>
and 30 minutes.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the binder, the aqueous<br>
polymeric siloxane has a molecular weight of at least 200 g/mol,<br>
advantageously at least 400 g/mol, particularly advantageously at least 800<br>
g/mol, preferably of 1000 g/mol. A molecular weight in this order of magnitude<br>
ensures that, on the one hand, the hydrolysis and condensation is sufficiently<br>
advanced so as to exclude the volatilization of organic components or at least<br>
to inhibit this to a very far-going extent. On the other hand, with a molecular<br>
weight of at least 1000 g/mol an adequate reactivity and water solubility still is<br>
ensured which is decisive for the employment properties of the binder.<br>
It is preferred, if the binder has a solids content of at least 0,5 % by weight,<br>
preferably of at least 10 % by weight, particularly preferably of at least 25 %<br>
by weight, advantageously of at least 50 % by weight, particularly<br>
advantageously of up to 70 % by weight , according to a preferred<br>
embodiment of up to 90 % by weight. With a solids content of at least 0,5 %<br>
by weight the binder can be manufactured, transported, stored and employed<br>
as well as processed.<br>
The binder according to the invention is adjusted for acid or neutral reaction,<br>
but may also reach alkaline pH-values. In that range it is stable in aqueous<br>
solution. The preferred pH-range ranges from pH 2 to pH 13, advantageously<br>
from pH 3 to pH 8. The pH-value depends initially on the silane employed as<br>
starting product or, where applicable, the mixtures of silanes employed for the<br>
manufacture of the polymeric siloxanes, and which optionally may be<br>
compounded with the afore described particles, in particular silicic soles. It<br>
may, however, also be determined as a function of the applicable application.<br><br>
According to an advantageous further development of the inventive concept,<br>
the binder may contain, as a starting product for the manufacture of the binder,<br>
besides silanes, also organic co-binders. In this context may be mentioned,<br>
for example, alkyde resins, aqueous or water-diluted epoxy resin esters,<br>
acrylate dispersions, phenoxy resins, melamine resins, polyurethane resins or<br>
epoxy resins. Co-binders may be added for various reasons, in order to set up<br>
properties suitable for the specific field of application, e.g. for improved<br>
bonding, for improved incorporation of further substances which are added<br>
during the further processing into coating compositions, for the adjustment of<br>
processing conditions and curing conditions, as well as for controlling the film-<br>
forming properties of the polymerized film. The amount of the co-binder<br>
employed amounts to 0,01 % by weight up to 50 % by weight based on the<br>
respective solids content of the binder.<br>
The binder according to the invention may be adapted based on the<br>
applicable purpose of use, and may therefore be made available with a solids<br>
content of 0,5 to 90 % by weight, ready for supply. This binder may be<br>
employed alone without further additives for the coating of work pieces, for<br>
example for the sealing of surfaces. The employment as a top coat, i.e. as a<br>
transparent cover coat is readily possible. Another typical mode of<br>
employment of the binder is its use in coating compositions for surfaces, in<br>
particular for corrosion protection compositions and for colourless or colour-<br>
imparting coating compositions. The binder or a coating composition<br>
manufactured using the afore described binder may be employed for the<br>
coating of a variety of work pieces. Large work pieces or surfaces, as well as<br>
small components, in particular mass produced small components such as<br>
screws, springs, clamps or clips can be coated. Typical fields of use are, for<br>
example, the coating of work pieces as well as shelf-goods, that is to say<br>
large work pieces which are coated individually, as well as of mass-produced<br>
small parts. Besides this coating by coil-coating processes in which the<br>
coating composition is usually applied by casting, doctor blade coating or in<br>
spray procedures, constitutes an important field of application.<br><br>
The binder or the coating composition produced therewith, can be employed<br>
for the nowadays conventional single- or multiple layered surface coatings,<br>
e.g. for coating of untreated or pre-treated metals. Pre-treated metals may<br>
have been pre-treated mechanically, e.g. by shot-blasting, but chemically pre-<br>
treated metal surfaces, e.g. phosphortized metal surfaces may also be coated.<br>
The pre-treated metal surfaces may also be pre-treated with a bonding primer.<br>
Passivated metal surfaces, beneficiated with zinc or zinc alloys may likewise<br>
be coated. A coating on such a substrate is conventionally referred to as a<br>
top-coat or sealing.<br>
It is considered a particular advantage that, when using a standardized binder<br>
a series of coating compositions can be offered, suitably to match: thus, for<br>
example, a first coating composition, a so-called base coat, may contain<br>
additives which contribute to corrosion protection. A second coating agent<br>
may then contain colouring pigments and a third coating composition contains<br>
no further additives but is applied in the manner of a top coat or as a surface<br>
sealing onto the first and the second coating composition. All of the aforesaid<br>
coating compositions contain the binder according to the invention. The third<br>
coating composition essentially consists of the binder according to the<br>
invention which is optionally adapted to the processing conditions.<br>
Also frequently, a base coat is applied onto a metallic passivated substrate,<br>
beneficiated with zinc or a zinc alloy, either in a single layer or in a plurality of<br>
layers. A top coat is then applied to the base coat. The base coat and the top<br>
coat contain the same binder.<br>
Coating compositions according to the invention may be employed using the<br>
same formulation in a plurality of layers or in different formulations, but using<br>
the same binder in a variety of manners. In this context it is an advantage that,<br>
due to the use of the same binder, the identical or at least similar processing<br>
conditions can be employed and the coats will adhere well, one on the other.<br><br>
The solids content of the coating composition amounts to at least 0,5 % and a<br>
maximum of 95 %, preferably at least 1 %, more preferably at least 20 %,<br>
advantageously more than 50 %.<br>
The coating compositions, besides the binder, comprise one or more additives.<br>
These additives may be selected from a wide selection of substances - as will<br>
be explained in what follows. They may be solid or liquid or pasty additives.<br>
Single additives may be employed or even mixtures of additives. The mixtures<br>
may be employed both of additives for the setting up of various properties as<br>
well as for the setting up of identical properties of the coating composition.<br>
In a simple embodiment, only additives are added to the coating composition<br>
besides the binder which ensure the processing of the binder under practical<br>
conditions, and optionally are adapted to further coating compositions. These<br>
may be additives for the adjustment of the substrate wetting, the viscosity<br>
and/or for adjusting the curing temperature or - time. Examples of such<br>
additives are water, alcohols, ketones, glycols, polyglycols, polypropylene<br>
glycol, glycol ethers, glycol ether esters, in particular dipropyleneglycol,<br>
texanol, methoxypropanol, butyle glycol and aromatic or aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbons. Those additives are added to the coating composition in<br>
amounts of 0,01 % by weight to 25 % by weight, preferably 0,1 % by weight to<br>
15 % by weight, each based on the overall formulation of the coating<br>
composition.<br>
As additives, also solid or liquid waxes as emulsion or dispersion may be<br>
added to the coating composition according to the invention in order, for<br>
example, to adjust the gliding properties of the coating. Conventional and<br>
known waxes may be employed, e.g. waxes on the basis of polyethylene or<br>
polypropylene, polytetrafluorethylene, polyvinylidenefluoride, or even natural<br>
waxes such as carnauba wax or mixtures of the aforementioned substances.<br>
Waxes may be employed - individually or in combination- in amounts of 0,01<br>
to 40 % by weight based on the overall formulation of the coating composition<br>
in the form in which it is supplied.<br><br>
Besides the binder according to the invention, the coating composition may<br>
furthermore contain additives which influence the rheology, the foam<br>
suppression, the flow properties, the de-aeration or the pigment wetting, but<br>
also agents for flexibilization or catalysts as well as water-capturing agents.<br>
These additives may each be added in proportions of 0.01 to 20 % by weight<br>
based on the overall formulation of the coating composition. Advantageously,<br>
between 2 % by weight and 8 % by weight, preferably less than 2 % by weight,<br>
particularly preferably less than 1 % by weight are added. In particular,<br>
monomeric or oligomeric silanes which act as water-capturing agents are<br>
frequently employed additives.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment the coating composition includes,<br>
besides the binder, as further additive, pigments or pigment paste which<br>
provide a colouring. These may be conventional organic or inorganic<br>
pigments or pigment pastes or even dyes, i.e. soluble solids having dye<br>
properties. Particular for the coating of metals, it is also possible to employ<br>
metal particles such as, for example, aluminium particles as pigments in order,<br>
e.g. to attain metallic effects. Besides the pigments, pigment pastes or dyes,<br>
fillers may be employed as additives, for example, calcium carbonate or<br>
silicates, in particular aluminium or magnesium silicates, barium sulphate or<br>
mixtures of fillers. The colouring pigments, pigment pastes, dyes and/or fillers<br>
are generally added in a proportion of 0,01 % by weight to 60 % by weight<br>
based on the overall formulation of the coating composition.<br>
Particularly preferred is the employment of the binder in a coating composition<br>
employed as a corrosion protection composition. The coating composition<br>
then includes the binder according to the invention as well as solid and/or<br>
liquid additives which improve the corrosion resistance of the pre-treated<br>
metal. Within the scope of the invention, in water soluble, dispersible or<br>
mixable corrosion inhibitors and/or corrosion preventing or retarding pigments<br>
are added with good effect, preferably nitrogen-containing compounds, in<br>
particular organic nitro compounds. Particularly preferred is dinitrosalicylic<br>
acid A further preferred addition to the coating composition are boron<br>
compounds, in particular from the group of boric acids or boric oxides, but<br><br>
also molybdenum compounds, in particular molybdates or compounds which<br>
contain phosphorus. These corrosion inhibitors are added in amounts of<br>
0,01 % by weight up to 30 % by weight based on the overall formulation, the<br>
lower limit being determined by the attainment of a desired effect, whereas<br>
the upper limit is determined on cost considerations.<br>
Highly effective corrosion protection is attained if to a coating composition<br>
containing the binder according to the invention, further additives are added<br>
which provide a cathodic corrosion protection. A plurality of metals, metal<br>
compounds and/or metal alloys are suitable for beneficiating or coating metal<br>
surfaces in order to prevent corrosion. They are employed as particulate<br>
metals. Within the scope of the invention, in particular, zinc, aluminium, iron,<br>
manganese and tin are used as particulate metals, zinc-aluminium-particles,<br>
zinc-manganese-particles, zinc-nickel-particles or chromium-nickel-steel-<br>
particles as particulate metal alloys in conjunction with the binder according to<br>
the invention as corrosion protection agent for the coating of metal surfaces,<br>
where, in particular, zinc and zinc compounds as well as a zinc aluminium<br>
compound provide a highly effective cathodic corrosion protection. In<br>
particular, in the form of so-called flakes, these particulate metals offer an<br>
effective corrosion protection. Flakes are not spherical but platelet-shaped<br>
particles which enhance a good coating formation. The aforesaid metals and<br>
metal compounds are particularly suitable in order to protect metal surfaces<br>
against corrosion. The metals, metal compounds and metal alloys can be<br>
employed in pure form as well as in mixtures of two or more substances in the<br>
composition according to the invention for coating. According to a preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention conductive additives are added to the<br>
composition for coating, preferably organic or inorganic conductive<br>
substances including silicon, iron phosphide, carbon black, nano- tubes or<br>
ICPs.<br>
According to a further advantageous embodiment of the invention, the<br>
particulate metal is employed in the form of dust, beads, spherical particles,<br>
lamellae and/or flakes. The layering of the metal particles resulting when<br>
applying these particles brings about a particularly good screening of the<br><br>
metal surface against corrosive effects. By mixing the metal particles, the<br>
corrosion protection composition may be adapted particularly well to the<br>
particular mode of application.<br>
In order to further optimize the cathodic corrosion protection, a content of the<br>
particulate metal of about 10 % by weight up to about 95 % by weight,<br>
preferably of about 20 % by weight up to about 80 % by weight, particularly<br>
preferred of about 20 % by weight up to about 60 % by weight based on the<br>
overall formulation of the coating composition, was found to be suitable. When<br>
employing zinc dust for a coating composition, 10 % by weight up to 95 % by<br>
weight were found to be advantageous, particularly advantageously 60% by<br>
weight up to 80% by weight of zinc in the form or zinc dust based on the<br>
overall formulation of the coating composition. If particulate metal in the form<br>
of flakes is employed, e.g. as zinc-, zinc aluminium or aluminium flakes, the<br>
proportion of particulate metal to the overall formulation of the coating<br>
composition advantageously amounts to 20 % by weight up to 50 % by weight.<br>
The coating composition according to the invention for the coating of metal<br>
surfaces may be designed, both as a single component-system, or as a two-<br>
component-system or multiple-component system. In particular, in the case of<br>
use as a corrosion protection agent, it may prove to be advantageous to<br>
initially store separately a component I and a component II and only to<br>
combine these when making the application. Should a mixture of different<br>
components required according to the formulation of the coating composition<br>
not be stable in storage, it is normal practice to manufacture, store and supply<br>
these components separately, and to mix them only for use.<br>
For example, a corrosion protection agent may comprise a component I with<br>
at least one particulate metal as well as, optionally, a water-capturing agent.<br>
The corresponding component II comprises an aqueous, polymeric siloxane<br>
free of emulsifying agent, according to claim 1 as a binding agent. If<br>
necessary, an inorganic or organic inhibitor is added to the component II. The<br>
components I and II, according to a preferred embodiment, are stored<br>
separately from one another until the use of the composition, e.g. in a dipping<br><br>
bath. This extends the shelf life of the composition until use, e.g. in a dipping<br>
bath. According to a preferred embodiment the particulate metal is mixed with<br>
organic solvent, in particular when the particulate metal, because of its large<br>
surface area, tends to undergo decomposition reactions which are<br>
suppressed by the organic solvent.<br>
The polymeric siloxane is generally employed in aqueous solutions. However,<br>
purely aqueous solutions cannot be employed in all cases, even though these<br>
are preferred. Depending on the compositions of components I and II,<br>
mixtures with organic solvents may be necessary. Preferred organic solvents<br>
which alone or in mixture with one another are employed with water, are<br>
alcohols, aromatic and/or aliphatic hydrocarbons, ketones, glycols, poly glycol,<br>
polypropylene glycol, glycol esters, glycol ethers and glycol ether esters, in<br>
particular dipropylene glycol, Texanol, methoxypropanol and butyl glycol, in<br>
each case as the sole solvent or as a mixture of the aforesaid solvents. The<br>
aforesaid solutions are added in an amount of 0,01 % by weight up to 35 % by<br>
weight, each based on the overall formulation of the coating composition.<br>
Details of the invention will be further elucidated in the following working<br>
examples:<br>
BINDER:<br>
Binder 1<br>
In the following, the synthesis of a binder for a molar-ratio silane: particles 1:2<br>
is elucidated.<br>
50 g Dynasilane ® GLYMO of Degussa (0,21 mol) are mixed with 127,3 g<br>
silicate particles, in this case: Levasil ® 200 E of HC Starck (0,42 mol) and<br>
stirred for 1 hour at room temperature. After 1 hour methanol and water are<br>
spun-off under vacuum until a solids content of 50% is attained. The pH-value<br>
of the SiO2-filled polymeric binder amounts to about 3,0.<br><br>
Binder 2<br>
Binder 2 is produced from Dynasilane ® GLYEO of Degussa and Levasil ®<br>
200 E of HC Starck in a molar ratio of 1 : 6 (silane : SiO2):<br>
50g {0,18 mol) Dynasilane ® GLYEO of the firm Degussa are mixed with<br>
stirring with 324,1 g (1,08 mol) Levasil ® 200 E of the firm HC Starck and<br>
further stirred for 24 h at room temperature. After 24 h, ethanol and water are<br>
spun-off under vacuum until such time that a solids content of 50 % has been<br>
attained.<br>
The pH-value of the particle-filled polymeric siloxane amounts to about 3.<br>
Binder 3<br>
Binder 3 is produced from Dynasilane ® GLYEO and Ludox ® SK of the firm<br>
Grace Davidson in a molar ratio 1 : 6 (silane : SiO2):<br>
50 g (0,18 mol) Dynasilane ® GLYEO are mixed with stirring with 259,3 g<br>
(1,08 mol) Ludox ® SK, and stirring is continued for 24 h at room temperature.<br>
After 24 h, ethanol and water are spun-off under vacuum until a solids content<br>
of 50 % is attained. The pH-value amounts to about 4,5.<br>
Binder 4<br>
Binder 4 is produced from Dynasilane ©GLYEO and Snowtex ® ST-O-40 of<br>
the firm Nissan Chemicals in a molar ratio of 1 :10 (silane: SiO2):<br>
50 g (0,18 mol) Dynasilane ® GLYEO are mixed with stirring with 270,1 g (1,8<br>
mol) Snowtex ® ST-O-40, and stirring is continued at room temperature for 24<br>
h. After 24 h ethanol and water are spun-off under vacuum until a solids<br>
content of 50 % is attained. The pH-value amounts to about 5.<br>
Binder 5<br>
Binder 5 is-produced from Dynasilane ® GLYEO and Snowtex ® ST-O-40 in<br>
a molar ratio 1 : 6 (silane : SiO2) at elevated temperature:<br>
50 g (0,18 mol) Dynasilane GLYEO are mixed with stirring with 162,1 g<br>
Snowtex ST-O-40 and further agitated for 2 hours at 60° C. After 24 h ethanol<br>
and water are spun-off at 60° C and reduced pressure until a solids content of<br>
50 % is attained. The pH-value amounts to about 5.<br><br>
The aforesaid binders are all aqueous film-forming, polymeric siloxanes.<br>
They can be applied as a coating onto work pieces, in particular those having<br>
metallic surfaces. When curing these binders to completion, only water from<br>
the condensation reactions is liberated. Alcohols or other volatile substances<br>
are not liberated by the curing of these polymeric siloxanes.<br>
COATING COMPOSITIONS:<br>
The use of the binders according to the invention in coating compositions is<br>
elucidated in the following. The coating composition according to this working<br>
example is composed of two components I and II. The components are<br>
produced and stored separately until their use. The separate storage ensures<br>
a longer shelf-life of the coating composition ready for use.<br>
30 g DPG (dipropylene glycol) are mixed under the dissolver with 3 g of a<br>
wetting agent including an HLB-V (hydro-lipophile-balance-value) of about 12,<br>
in this case: Neodol ® 91-5 of the firm Caldig Deutschland GmbH and 2,6 g<br>
of a water capturing agent in the form of a monomeric silane, in this case:<br>
Dynasilane ® GLYMO. After homogenizing, 88,3 g of a particulate metal are<br>
added. The particulate metal is here employed as a paste: zink-aluminium-<br>
powder having a content of 90 ± 3 % zinc and 7 ± 3% aluminium based on<br>
100 % of the employed particulate metal and an average particle size of about<br>
14 µm is processed with aliphatic hydrocarbons and lubricants to form a paste<br>
adjusted to a solids content of 90 ± 2 %. This paste is mixed under moderate<br>
shearing and dispersed for 60 min. until a highly viscous paste has been<br>
formed (component I).<br>
For the manufacture of component II, 30 g of a 1% dinitrosalicylic acid<br>
solution (DNSS-solution) with 4,5 g of a thickening agent are mixed under<br>
shearing conditions for the adjustment of the viscosity, in this case: Aerosil ®<br>
200 of the firm Degussa, in that the Aerosil ® 200 is slowly sprinkled into the<br>
DNSS-solution. The mixture is dispersed for 60 min. Thereafter, the thickened<br>
DNSS/A200-solution is added with stirring by means of a dissolver to 66 g of<br>
the SiO2-filled polymeric binding agent, which has been produced as<br>
described above as Binder 1, and the mixture is homogenized for 60 min.<br><br>
For the production of a dipping bath, the component II is slowly added under<br>
moderate shearing conditions to component I. The mixture of components I<br>
and II is thereafter homogenized in a dissolver at about 1-2 m/s shear velocity<br>
for 60 min. After 60 min the homogenized composition is further agitated over<br>
night (16 h) and is ready for processing on the next morning.<br>
The coating composition has a viscosity of 30-40 seconds (Ford 4 discharge<br>
beaker) and a pH-value of about 5,2. For coating purposes, the coating<br>
composition is diluted with de-ionized water to a viscosity of 25 sec (Ford 4<br>
discharge beaker). The adjusted material can be applied by the conventional<br>
coating method on to a variety of substrates.<br>
Conventionally, the coating composition is applied by the dipping-spinning-<br>
process onto mass-produced small components such as, e.g. screws or nuts.<br>
However, - depending on the work piece to be coated - it may also be applied<br>
by casting, doctor-blade coating, spraying, roller-coating or dipping onto<br>
work pieces, e.g. onto shelf goods, i.e. individually to be coated major<br>
components or onto coils and subsequently pre-dried for 10 min at 80 • C.<br>
Thereafter, the coating is cured to such an extent that the coated work piece<br>
can be transported. Either subsequent to the first coating or after applying<br>
further layers of coating compositions, the pre-dried material is polymerized<br>
for 30 min at 300 oC, i.e. finally cured, so that the coating attains its final use<br>
characteristics.<br>
This coating procedure is, for example, performed when coating screws in the<br>
dipping-spinning-process, conventionally twice. After the application of the<br>
first coat, the first coat is cured and further cooled. After the application of the<br>
second coat of the coating composition, the coating is pre-dried as described<br>
above and baked.<br>
The coated screws (screw blank M10x80 according to DIN 931), after coating,<br>
exhibit e.g. a coating weight according to DIN 931 of 0,08 to 0,120 g/screw,<br>
preferably of 0,09 to 0,11 g/screw and, in the salt spray test according to DIN<br><br>
50021, have a corrosion resistance against red rust &gt; 480 h, preferably &gt; 600<br>
h. The finished coating composition exhibits, with agitation at 22°C /55°C<br>
relative air humidity, a pot life of at least 7 days, maximally of 14 days. During<br>
such storage, it is necessary to continuously agitate and to cool as well as to<br>
control the viscosity and the pH-value. Prior to coating, the viscosity must be<br>
adjusted by the addition of de-ionized water to 25 sec (Ford 4).<br>
Coating composition Top-coat<br>
For the manufacture of a transparent top-coat which is applied as the only<br>
coat or the last coat of a multiple coating onto the surface of a work piece, a<br>
transparent coating composition is produced, using 5 % by weight of the<br>
above described binding agent "Binder 1" and 95 % by weight water, each<br>
based on the overall formulation of the coating composition. The coating<br>
composition can be applied by optional application procedures: it may, for<br>
example, be sprayed on, rolled on, doctor-bladed on, or be applied by dipping.<br>
The final curing of this cop coat proceeds over a period of 20 minutes at<br>
150 °C.<br><br>
