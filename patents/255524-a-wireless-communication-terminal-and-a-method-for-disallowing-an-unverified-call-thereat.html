A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION TERMINAL AND A<br>
METHOD FOR DISALLOWING AN UNVERIFIED CALL<br>
THEREAT<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for<br>
limiting call originations accompanied by executing an application at a<br>
communication terminal.<br>
Background Art<br>
Advancement of portable telephones is accelerating. Recently, it<br>
is possible to access servers on the Internet through a portable telephone<br>
to download a variety of contents and applications. Such applications<br>
that are downloaded from a network and used include, for example, an<br>
application called "Java Applet" described in the Java (registered<br>
trademark) programming language.<br>
Open networks, including the Internet, generally have poor security,<br>
and hence, Java Applets distributed through such an open network are not<br>
necessarily reliable.<br>
Accordingly, it is necessary to exclude accesses to networks<br>
established by an illegal Java Applet. In response to this demand, there<br>
has been proposed an access limiting technique called "sandbox model."<br>
The sandbox model allows communication terminals, which perform as<br>
clients, to access only a server from which a Java Applet is downloaded.<br>
However, it is anticipated that network resources will be further<br>
integrated or distributed in the future. In such situations, some cases are<br>
likely to happen where applying the existing access limiting technique<br>
mentioned above is not adequate.<br><br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to propose a<br>
new mechanism for limiting network accesses gained by executing<br>
applications on a communication terminal.<br>
To this end, the present invention provides a call origination<br>
limiting method including a comparison step for comparing, when a call<br>
origination is performed from a communication terminal accompanied by<br>
executing an application, a telephone number of a communication node,<br>
for which a call origination is to be implemented, with a telephone number<br>
of a communication node which has been stored in a storing means<br>
beforehand and for which a call origination has been granted, and a<br>
determination step for determining whether the call origination should be<br>
granted or not on a basis of the result of the comparison.<br>
According to the present invention, when a call origination of a<br>
predetermined communication node is accompanied by executing an<br>
application, it is determined whether the call origination should be granted<br>
or not by checking the telephone number of the communication node to be<br>
one of the telephone numbers that have been granted in advance. This<br>
permits improved security to be achieved.<br>
In a preferred form, the storing means is a memory for storing<br>
telephone directory data, and compares the telephone number of the<br>
communication node to be called with the telephone numbers included in<br>
the telephone directory data in the comparison step.<br>
In another preferred form, the storing means is a memory for <br>
storing a history of outgoing/incoming calls, and compares the telephone<br>
number of the communication node to be called with telephone numbers<br>
of at least either the outgoing calls or incoming calls in the history of<br>
outgoing/incoming calls in the comparison step.<br>
In still another preferred form, the storing means stores plural<br><br>
types of telephone number groups, and compares, in the comparison step,<br>
the telephone number of the communication node for which the call<br>
origination is to be implemented with a type of telephone number groups<br>
corresponding to an application to be executed.<br>
In a preferred form, the call origination limiting method is provided<br>
with a step for outputting a predetermined error message and prompting<br>
an operation for instructing a call origination performed by a user if a call<br>
origination processing has been rejected in the determination step, and a<br>
step for accepting the operation for instructing the call origination<br>
performed by the user and carrying out the call origination.<br>
In each form described above, the call origination is a processing<br>
for line connection for voice communication or data communication.<br>
The present invention can be implemented also in a form wherein a<br>
carrying out program for the call origination limiting method described<br>
above is distributed to a user through a telecommunication line, or in a<br>
form wherein such a program stored in a computer-readable medium is<br>
distributed to a user.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention can be implemented in a form<br>
wherein a communication terminal for carrying out the method for<br>
limiting call origination explained above is manufactured and marketed.<br>
Such a communication terminal is provided with a means for storing<br>
telephone numbers of communication node for which a call origination<br>
has been granted, a means for comparing a telephone number of<br>
communication node for which a call origination is to be implemented<br>
with the telephone numbers stored in the storing means when a call<br>
origination is accompanied by executing an application, and a means for<br>
determining whether the call origination should be granted or not on a<br>
basis of the result of the comparison.<br>
An example of the communication terminal is a portable telephone<br><br>
performing radio communication.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Referring to the drawings, an embodiment will be described in<br>
accordance with the present invention as follows:<br>
In this embodiment, an example will be explained in which a<br>
portable telephone for radio data communication executes an application<br>
described with Java (registered trademark) programming language<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "Java application"). The present invention,<br>
however, can be implemented in various modifications within the scope of<br>
the technological spirit thereof, rather than being limited to the<br>
embodiment.<br>
A: Configuration<br><br>
First, the configuration of the embodiment will be explained.<br>
(1) Configuration of the entire system<br>
Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing the configuration of the entire<br>
system according to the embodiment of the present invention. As shown<br>
in the drawing, the system is constructed of portable telephones 10a and<br>
10b, a mobile data communication network 20, a server 25, the Internet 30,<br>
and a download server 40.<br>
The portable telephones 10a and 10b are owned by users to receive<br>
call services of a mobile telephone network, which is not shown, and to<br>
perform radio communication with a base station 21 of the mobile data<br>
communication network 20 to receive data communication service of the<br>
network 20. The portable telephones 10a and 10b incorporate a browser<br>
for browsing various pages on the Internet 30 and a Java virtual machine<br>
for supporting Java (registered trademark), which allows various Java<br>
applications to be executed.<br>
The portable telephones 10a and 10b share the same configurations<br>
and operations, so they shall be generically referred to as a portable<br>
telephone 10 hereinafter unless it is necessary to distinguish them in<br>
explanation.<br>
The mobile data communication network 20 is constituted of base<br>
station 21, switching office, which is not shown, and communication lines<br>
for connecting them. Multiple base stations 21 are deployed at<br>
predetermined intervals in a communication service area of the mobile<br>
data communication network 20 to effect radio communication with the<br>
portable telephones 10 movably located in respective radio cells. The<br>
mobile data communication network 20 is connected to the Internet 30<br>
through a gateway, which is not shown, and two-way data transfer is<br>
possible between the networks.<br>
The download server 40 holds data in an HTML (Hypertext<br><br>
Markup Language) format that can be referred by using the browser of the<br>
portable telephone 10, and various types of Java applications, and<br>
provides them to the portable telephone 10 through the intermediary of the<br>
Internet 30 and the mobile data communication network 20.<br>
Java applications held by the download server 40 include, for<br>
example, software for providing PIM (Personal Information Management)<br>
to a user of the portable telephone 10 and game software for the user of<br>
the portable telephone 10 to play a confrontational game with another user.<br>
When these Java applications are downloaded from the download server<br>
40 to the portable telephone 10 and executed by the portable telephone 10,<br>
a predetermined communication node is called, and processing is carried<br>
out by performing communication with the communication node. There<br>
is also a Java application in which, when a user specifies a call destination<br>
communication node, a so-called "PhoneTo" function is implemented to<br>
call the communication node to effect voice communication.<br>
In this case, as a call destination communication node, there are,<br>
for example, server 25, portable telephones 10 other than the portable<br>
telephone 10 that executes an application, and fixed telephones, which are<br>
not shown.<br>
The server 25 has a function for providing a user with the PIM<br>
service. More specifically, the server 25 has a memory area for storing<br>
schedules, note pads, etc. of each user, and performs updating or the like<br>
of such data in response to requests received from the portable telephone<br>
10 of each user. In this case, the Java application downloaded into the<br>
portable telephone 10 is carried out thereby to cause the portable<br>
telephone 10 to call the server 25 and perform processing in cooperation<br>
with the server 25 to receive the PIM service.<br>
If the Java application downloaded into the portable telephone 10<br>
is a confrontational game to play with another portable telephone 10, then<br><br>
the portable telephone 10a, for example, calls the portable telephone 10b.<br>
Thereafter, communication is carried out between the portable telephones<br>
10a and 10b to execute the Java application.<br>
Thus, a Java application is executed on the portable telephone 10<br>
so as to connect a line by calling a predetermined communication node<br>
and to execute a processing (including voice communication processing)<br>
by performing communication with the communication node.<br>
However, when the presence of an illegal application mentioned<br>
above is taken into account, it is not desirable to allow a call origination<br>
processing based on a instruction of Java applications without limitation.<br>
For this reason, the embodiment imposes a certain limitation on a<br>
call origination processing accompanied by executing a Java application.<br>
(2) Hardware configuration of portable telephone 10<br>
Referring now to the block diagram shown in Fig. 2, the hardware<br>
configuration of the portable telephone 10 will be described.<br>
As shown in the drawing, the portable telephone 10 is constructed<br>
of a transmitting/receiving unit 11, a control unit 12, a user interface unit<br>
13, and a bus 14 interconnecting them.<br>
The transmitting/receiving unit 11 is constituted of an antenna and<br>
a communication control circuit, which are not shown, and performs radio<br>
communication with the base stations 21 of the mobile data<br>
communication network 20.<br>
The user interface unit 13 is constructed of a liquid crystal display<br>
for displaying various types of information, a key pad for a user to<br>
perform various types of input operations, and a microphone with a<br>
speaker for telephone calls of the user.<br>
The control unit 12 controls each part of the portable telephone 10,<br>
and is constructed of a CPU 121, a ROM 122, and an SRAM 123.<br>
Various control programs or the like are stored in the ROM 122,<br><br>
and the CPU 121 reads out the control programs to execute various types<br>
of control processing. Control programs in the ROM 122 include an<br>
operating system provided in the portable telephone 10, a browser, and<br>
various types of software, which will be discussed hereinafter.<br>
The SRAM 123 is used as a work area of the CPU 121, and also<br>
stores Java applications downloaded from the download server 40, the<br>
history of outgoing/incoming calls of the portable telephone 10, and<br>
telephone directory data entered by a user.<br>
Fig. 3 is a diagram showing an example of the history of<br>
outgoing/incoming calls stored in the SRAM 123, and Fig. 4 is a diagram<br>
showing an example the telephone directory data stored in the SRAM 123.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the history of outgoing calls is stored with date<br>
and time when the portable telephone 10 made each call, associated with<br>
the telephone number of the communication node from which the<br>
telephone call was made (the originating telephone number). Similarly,<br>
the history of incoming calls is stored with date and time when the<br>
portable telephone 10 received each call, associated with the telephone<br>
number of the communication node from which the telephone call,<br>
corresponding to the received call, was made (the incoming telephone<br>
number).<br>
Furthermore, the telephone directory data is stored with<br>
interrelated names and telephone numbers, as shown in Fig. 4.<br>
As for a processing for storing of histories of outgoing and<br>
incoming calls, well-known arts shall be applied and the explanation<br>
thereof will be omitted.<br>
(3) Software configuration of portable telephone<br>
The software configuration of the portable telephone 10 will now<br>
be described.<br>
Fig. 5 is a schematic diagram showing the software configuration<br><br>
of the portable telephone 10. As shown in the drawing, the software of<br>
the portable telephone 10 is constituted of an operating system OS, a Java<br>
application manager JAM, a Java K virtual machine KVM and a Java<br>
application AP in this order from a lowermost layer to an uppermost layer.<br>
The operating system OS is a well-known software installed in a<br>
portable telephone to support basic processing of the portable telephone<br>
10.<br>
The Java application manager JAM is software mainly for control<br>
and security check on the Java K virtual machine KVM. To be more<br>
specific, the Java application manager JAM refers to the aforesaid<br>
histories of outgoing/incoming calls and the telephone directory data and<br>
determine whether the call origination processing should be executed or<br>
not by checking whether the telephone number of the above<br>
communication node is included therein, when a call origination is<br>
processed to a predetermined communication node accompanied by<br>
executing the Java application AP. The determination is based on an<br>
idea: a call origination processing can be granted in such cases that the<br>
node communication telephone number of the call origination is included<br>
in the histories of outgoing/incoming calls or the telephone directory data,<br>
because this means that the portable telephone 10 performed<br>
communication with the communication node in the past or the user<br>
recognized it as a communication partner.<br>
The Java K virtual machine KVM carries out the Java application<br>
under the control of the Java application manager JAM. The Java virtual<br>
machine KVM and the Java application manager JAM are incorporated<br>
into the operating system OS in advance, and they are all stored in the<br>
ROM 122.<br>
The Java application AP is the software described in the Java<br>
(registered trademark) programming language as mentioned above, and it<br><br>
is downloaded into the portable telephone 10 from the download server 40,<br>
then written to and stored in the SRAM 123.<br>
B: Operation<br>
The operation of the embodiment with the above configurations<br>
will now be explained.<br>
Fig. 6 is a flowchart showing the processing execution of the Java<br>
application AP by the portable telephone 10.<br>
When an instruction is issued for starting up a requested Java<br>
application AP by user's operation, the Java application AP is started up<br>
on the Java K virtual machine KVM shown in Fig. 3 in response to the<br>
instruction, and the processing is executed unit by unit which is an<br>
execution unit called "class" (step S1).<br>
Then, it is determined whether the class to be executed is the<br>
processing that requires a call origination or not to a communication node<br>
(step S2).<br>
If the class does not require the call origination processing (NO in<br>
step S2), then the Java K virtual machine KVM repeats the processing of<br>
step S1, and executes the processing corresponds to the class.<br>
If the class requires the call origination processing (YES in step<br>
S2), then the Java application manager JAM refers to the telephone<br>
number of the communication node, for which the call origination<br>
processing is to be implemented, the histories of outgoing/incoming calls<br>
and the telephone directory data and compares them in response to a<br>
request from the Java K virtual machine KVM (step S3).<br>
If a comparison result indicates that the same telephone number as<br>
that of the communication node for which the call origination processing<br>
is to be implemented has been found in the histories of outgoing/incoming<br>
calls or the telephone directory data (YES in step S4), then the Java<br>
application manager JAM determines that the call origination processing<br><br>
has been granted and instructs that the Java K virtual machine KVM to<br>
execute the call origination processing (step S5).<br>
If no telephone number, which is identical to that of the<br>
communication node for which the call origination processing is to be<br>
carried out, is found in the histories of outgoing/incoming calls and the<br>
telephone directory data (NO in step S4), then it is determined that the call<br>
origination processing has not been granted. The Java application<br>
manager JAM instructs the Java K virtual machine KVM to display a<br>
message on a liquid crystal display, indicating that the call origination<br>
processing cannot be granted, together with another message indicating<br>
that user's instruction is necessary to perform call origination (step S6).<br>
The displayed in this case can be a message, for example, " You<br>
need to call oo-xxxx-∆∆∆∆ to continue the processing. Are you making<br>
the call? Press key 1 for YES or press key 2 for NO."<br>
If the user issues an instruction for making the call (YES in step<br>
S7), then the processing comes to step S5 wherein the Java K virtual<br>
machine KVM carries out the call origination processing. Then, the<br>
processing returns to step S1 wherein the processing for executing the<br>
Java application AP is continued.<br>
In this case, a call origination is made in the step S5 processing so<br>
that the telephone number used for making the call is stored in the history<br>
of outgoing calls. Hence, the call origination processing will be granted<br>
thereafter concerning this telephone number by step S4 determination<br>
above mentioned.<br>
If an instruction is issued by the user not to make the call (NO in<br>
step S7), then the Java application AP is forcibly terminated by the Java<br>
application manager JAM in response to the instruction (step S8).<br>
In this way, a call origination is granted only if the result indicates<br>
conformity after the comparison of the communication node telephone<br><br>
number to be implemented for the call origination with the histories of<br>
outgoing/incoming calls and the telephone directory data.<br>
That is to say, in this embodiment, call originations are limited to<br>
the communication nodes called before or the communication nodes<br>
registered in the telephone directory by the user to ensure the security<br>
thereby.<br>
C: Modification examples<br>
As previously mentioned, the present invention is not limited to the<br>
embodiment described above, and may be implemented in various<br>
modifications as shown below.<br>
(1)	Form of each communication node<br>
In the embodiment described above, the portable telephone 10 has<br>
been used as the subject executing applications. The subject executing<br>
applications, however, is not limited thereto; it may be a fixed telephone<br>
or a personal computer connected to a portable telephone or a fixed<br>
telephone.<br>
A communication node to be called is not limited to the server 25<br>
or the portable telephone 10; it may be a personal computer or the like<br>
connected to a fixed network and placed at home or in an office.<br>
Thus, the subjects executing the applications and the objects to be<br>
called are not limited as long as they are communication nodes to which<br>
lines are connected by using telephone numbers to perform data<br>
communication or voice communication.<br>
(2)	The use of the histories of outgoing/incoming calls and telephone<br>
directory data<br>
In the embodiment, both the histories of outgoing/incoming calls<br>
and the telephone directory data have been used to determine whether the<br>
call origination processing should be granted or not; however, the present<br><br>
invention is not limited thereto. Alternatively, whether call origination<br>
processing should be granted may be determined by using only the history<br>
of outgoing calls, only the history of incoming calls, or only the telephone<br>
directory data, or by using at least two of them.<br>
(3) Processing for different applications<br>
In the embodiment, even when a plurality of Java applications AP<br>
have been installed in the portable telephone 10, it has been determined<br>
whether call origination should be implemented by using all the histories<br>
of outgoing/incoming calls and the telephone director data without<br>
awareness of differences among applications, when any of the Java<br>
applications AP is carried out; however, the present invention is not<br>
limited thereto. Alternatively, data on which the determination is based<br>
may be limited for each application AP to be executed.<br>
For instance, for the first Java application only the telephone<br>
directory data may be the foundation on which determination is based, for<br>
the second Java application both histories of outgoing/incoming calls and<br>
telephone directory data may be the foundation on which determination is<br>
based, and for the third Java application, without providing any<br>
foundation on which determination is based, calls to all communication<br>
nodes may be granted.<br>
As for this occasion users may determine every time which data<br>
shall be the determination foundation, or the Java application manager<br>
JAM may determine according to attributes of a Java application AP.<br>
Java applications AP are not necessarily limited to those<br>
downloaded from a network. For example, some Java applications AP are<br>
stored in the ROM 122 in advance. Such Java Applications AP are<br>
considered to be with high security and no limitation may be put on the<br>
call originations. Furthermore, Java applications AP that are<br>
downloaded from the download server 40 authenticated by predetermined<br><br>
certificate authorities may be expected to provide respectable security.<br>
Hence, both the histories of outgoing/incoming calls and the telephone<br>
directory data may be used as the foundations on which determinations are<br>
based to ease the restrictions on call origination. Security may not be<br>
expected much for Java applications AP downloaded from download<br>
server 40 that are not authenticated by predetermined certificate<br>
authorities. Hence, only a telephone directory data history may be used<br>
as the foundation on which determinations are based enhancing<br>
restrictions on call origination.<br>
(4) Programming language<br>
In the embodiment, the Java (registered trademark) has been used;<br>
the present invention, however, is not limited thereto. It is needless to<br>
say that other programming languages may be used.<br><br>
