				<td>The side stand alarm for Two wheelers is the one of the life saving electrical mechanisms which provide the rider about the negligence to release the side stand while riding by giving an alarm which optionally may be the horn of the vehicle or the additional siren. The additional circuit uses the tensional spring, which contacts or closes the horn circuit and thereby energises the blow indicating the rider about the unreleased position of the side stand or side stand in use. This prevents the rider as well the vehicle to loose the centre of gravity by imbalance or surface hindrance and thereby saves life of the rider. The Side stand alarm is cheap, rugged and easier to install without additional installations as the horn and batter circuit provided in the vehicle will support the configuration of the present invention.

The present invention relates to the field of automobiles industry, especially for two-wheeler vehicles using side stand apart from the Main center stand provided therein for the resting of the vehicle.<br>
The invention in particular provides an electronic circuit system which alarms or sirens the person handling the vehicle about the unreleased side stand and there by prevent him from being endanger or to have safe movement.<br>
Thus the present invention provides an alarm system for the vehicle handler or rider about the ignorance to release the side stand under vehicle movement.<br>
Prior Art and Technical know-how:<br>
The need for human to move from a place to place to cater his essential needs have led to the development in automobile industry. To have independent movement, two-wheeler vehicles are been used more frequently by the individuals besides other common or four-wheeler or three-wheeler vehicles. So it becomes essential for the two-wheeler vehicle holder to ensure his personal safety by having a safe drive or Journey. The personal safety is considered to be the most important factor not only to safeguard him but also to ensure security on others who depend on him.<br>
The stability of the vehicle is represented by the Centre of Gravity (CG) of the vehicle and rider/s combined together. This is the point through which all forces act. In case of Two-wheeled vehicles, the vehicle is provided with two stands for resting or parking the vehicle when not is use.<br>
The two stands being:<br>
1.	Center Stand<br>
2.	Side Stand<br><br>
The center stand is used to give proper control on the center of point of the vehicle. The center stand is located below the base of the engine with center of gravity of the vehicle been passing through the center stand axis, thereby having a more stable equilibrium position of the vehicle is achieved.<br>
The side stand is been provided along with the center stand that is to place the center of point of the vehicle to lie with in the vehicle. Side stand is used whenever there is neither stable nor rigid surface for laying center stand, or slippery surfaces, or slopes, or less space to park etc in such cases side stand is used predominantly. Hence all the two wheelers especially bikes and Mopeds now a days are placed with this accessory to ascertain easy service to the vehicle handler.<br>
One of the most common problems that are encountered in using the side stand is negligence or carelessness to kick back the side stand. The negligence may be due to absence of mind, urgency, divergence in concentration and few other reasons, which may prevent the rider to kick back the side stand to its original position. Failure to kick back the side stand for any of the reasons stated above may hit the side stand and there by affect the stability of the vehicle and lead to accident of the vehicle and riders involve in the accident, some times fatal.<br>
To ensure security or safety of the rider, during absence of mind or negligence or urgency or carelessness the automobile industry have developed an electronfc senior based side stand alarm in bikes. This electronic circuit is provided with a sensor and receiver assembly placed in the vicinity of the side stand there by the sensor and receiver are in coaxial direction when side stand is placed in position for resting the vehicle. When the ignition switch is ON and since the sensor and receiver are in coaxial direction the alarm light placed in vision of the rider beeps and indicates the rider about the negligence to kick off the side stand. Thereby it ensures the riHprtn kirk hank thp RJdft ?;tand and ensure hiah safetv in ridino.<br><br>
But the basic disadvantage of the above said system is that any clog or block either on sensor or receiver may cause failure in the system. The clog or block occurring in the sensor or receiver is by layering of mud or soil or in case of watery loose soil it may stack the sensor or receiver thereby affects the normal working of the system.<br>
The inventor has over come the said disadvantage by providing an additional electrical system of Contact switches and a tensional spring along with the existing normal electrical system of any vehicle. The electrical system is connected to the horn of the vehicle or to any other additional siren as the case may be, so that it provides an alarm to the rider about the side stand in use.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The side stand alarm used in two wheelers for alerting or guiding the rider about the unreleased position of side stand while driving comprising Tensile spring, Contact switches and electrical wiring circuit characterized theirin the side stand is fixed with the tensile spring which closes the electric circuit for the horn provided in the vehicle or alarm beep through the Contact switch which energies from battery in the vehicle and indicates a horn or alarm to the rider about the unreleased position of the side stand or side stand in use.<br>
In preferred embodiment the side stand alarm may be fitted using an additional siren or alarm in place of the horn.<br><br>
Detailed Description:<br>
The side stand is an essential additional accessory fitted to the two-wheeler or bike or Moped of the automobile industry. As it is the duty of the automobile industry or the vendor to supply the vehicle with the safety aspects, the side stand is also fitted to all possible two-wheelers. The side stand is being made of hardened steel can resist high tensional load, shock and axial load acting over it.<br>
This side stand is been fitted to provide an additional resting or parking facility apart from the main centre stand in conditions of poor soil stability, rough surfaces, less space, urgency of the work nature, etc., The side stand provided in such vehicles can be additionally fitted with the following electrical Contact switches and can provide an alarm system for the rider in case of the negligence to kick back the side stand or when side stand is not released back to its position or when side stand is in use.<br>
The side stand is fitted with an additional tensional spring that provides necessary force for the Contact switch to close the circuit and thereby blow horn or siren when it is in unreleased condition.<br>
The alarm circuit is placed parallel with the existing horn circuit such that the same horn is used to indicate the rider about the unreleased position of the side stand. The electrical system of the vehicle is already been provided with the necessary components of the present side stand alarm, which includes additionally few Contact switch and Tensional spring. The major components of the system are:<br>
1.	Battery<br>
2.	Contact switch<br>
3.	Tensional Spring<br>
4.	Horn<br>
5.	Contact for Lamp (optional)<br><br>
Battery: Rechargeable batteries (also known as Secondary cells) are batteries that can be restored to full charge by the application of electrical energy. Wet lead acid battery - a large battery (e.g. 70 Ah) is relatively cheap when compared to other chemistries. However, this battery chemistry has lower energy density than other battery chemistries available today. Its applications include vehicles, alarm systems, and uninterruptible power supplies.<br>
Lead-acid car batteries for a 12-volt system consist of six cells of 2.1V nominal voltage. Each cell contains (in the charged state) electrodes of lead metal (Pb) and lead (IV) oxide (Pb02) in an electrolyte of about 37% (or 6-12M) w/w sulfuric acid (H2S04). In the discharged state both electrodes turn into lead (II) sulfate (PbS04) and the electrolyte loses its dissolved sulfuric acid and becomes primarily water. Due to the freezing-point depression of water, as the battery discharges and the concentration of sulfuric acid decreases, the electrolyte (including the more modern gellified electrolyte of the gel battery) is more likely to freeze.<br>
The chemical reactions are (charged to discharged): Anode (Oxidation):<br>
Pb(s) + S04^^-\an) PbS04(S) + 2e G° = 0.356V<br>
Cathode (reduction):<br>
0 _<br>
Pb02(s) + S04(2-) (aq) + 4H + 2e- ^^_^ PbSo4(s) + 2 HsOd) e^ = 1.685V<br>
Contact Switch: A contact switch can be constructed with any mechanism bringing two conductors into contact with each other in a controlled manner. This can be as simple as allowing two copper wires to touch each other by the motion of a lever, or by directly pushing two metal strips into contact. However, a good switch design must be rugged and reliable, and avoid presenting the operator with the possibility of electric shock or failure.<br><br>
Tensional Spring: The essential features of the spring include: The springs are mainly made of carbon spring steel, alloy spring steel, refractory steel, stainless steel. The diameter of the spring is in the range of 0.15mm to 60mm with the thickness of the steel being 0.15mm to 20mm. These springs high-life springs have good hardness and resistance to stress.<br>
Horn: Horn (acoustic), an open-ended tapered sound-guide to match a sound-producing device to the characteristic impedance of free space. The electromechanical horn or alerting device is mainly used in automobiles, train and ships, they alert listeners of the vehicle's arrival and possible danger.<br>
Horn is produced by a spring - steel diaphragm with a rivet in the centre that is repeatedly struck by the teeth of a rotating cog-wheel. The diaphragm is attached to a horn which acts as an acoustic transformer as well as controlling the direction of the sound.<br>
Working Principle:<br>
The principle behind the working of the invention can be well explained by the two position of the side stand:<br>
1.	OFF position or Released position<br>
2.	ON position or supporting position<br>
Released Position: In this position, the side stand is away from the surface or road on which the vehicle moves. This is the normal position of side stand when not in use or in motion. In this position, the tensional spring is in relaxed form thereby the Contact Switch connected to the spring does not close the battery power circuit to energize the horn or siren to blow.<br><br>
Supporting Position: In this position, the side stand supports the vehicle when parked. The side stand stretches away from the axis of the vehicle. In this position, the tensional spring is expanded so the torsion force which makes the Contact Switch with the spring to come in contact with the terminal of Contact Switch which activates or closes the electrical circuit. So when the ignition is switched ON, the horn gets energized from battery and blows sound there by indicating the rider about the position of side stand underneath. The description can be explained clearly as illustrated in the drawings.<br>
In another Embodiment, the alarm indicator may be another individual Siren or alarm of lower intensity than Horn. This is also used in case of the Horn as in case of Horn the failure in Horn electrical circuit may cause failure of the system mentioned in this invention. The second embodiment of the invention also has the Side alarm Indicator being the siren or beep horn instead of Main Horn placed in vicinity of rider.<br>
In Second Embodiment of the invention, the alarm may have an option to place an indicator bulb near the Ignition key so that it may signal the rider about the unreleased position of the side stand.<br>
Figure 1 shows the general circuit of the horn in two-wheeler<br>
Figure 2 shows the circuit of the embodiment of present invention<br>
Detail Description of the drawings:<br>
With reference to the figure 1 it shows the actual existing circuit of the two-wheeler vehicles, it shows the 12V Battery 1 with the negative terminal being grounded to body 2 and the positive terminal of battery is connected to the positive terminal of the horn 5. The negative terminal of the horn 5 is ground to the vehicle body (not shown). The positive terminal of the battery is connected to the horn through a horn switch 4 and Ignition switch 3.<br><br>
With reference to the figure 2, it shows the additional circuit of side stand alarm indicator which is also connected to the horn switch. The side stand indicator works only when the side stand is in ON position or supporting position. The working can be explained by the relative two positions of the side stand 9. When the side stand 9 is in OFF position (A), the spring 8 having Contact switch terminal 7 opens with a terminal 6 and thus the hom is not energized. When the side stand 9 is in ON position (B), the spring 8 having Contact switch terminal 7 closes with the terminal 6 and the horn get energized and alarms the rider about the ignorance or failure to kick back the side stand.<br><br><br><br><br>
