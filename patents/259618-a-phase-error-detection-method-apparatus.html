				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION	<br>
The present invention relates to A phase error detection method and system and more specifically to an MR imaging method capable of reducing degradation in image quality due to residual maganetization, a phase error measuring method for measuring a phase error developed due to the residual magnetization, and an MRI system which executes these methods.<br>
The  following prior arts  have  been disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H10-75940.<br>
(1)	A phase error measuring method of executing a<br>
pre-scan sequence for transmitting an excitation pulse,<br>
transmitting an inversion pulse, applying a phase encoding<br>
pulse to a phase axis, applying a read pulse to a read<br>
axis,  applying  a  rewind  pulse  to  the  phase  axis,<br>
subsequently transmitting an inversion pulse, applying a<br>
dephaser pulse to the phase axis, and collecting data from<br>
echoes while applying a read pulse to the phase axis, and<br>
thereby measuring a phase error of each subsequent echo,<br>
which is developed due to the influence of eddy currents<br>
and residual magnetization caused by a phase encoding<br>
pulse, etc., based on phase data obtained by converting the<br>
collected data into one-dimensional Fourier form, and<br>
(2)	An MR imaging method of, in a pulse sequence of a<br>
high-speed spin echo process for transmitting an inversion<br>
pulse after the transmission of an excitation pulse,<br>
applying a phase encoding pulse to a phase axis, collecting<br>
data from echoes while applying a read pulse to a read<br>
axis, repeating the application of a rewind pulse to the<br>
phase axis plural times while the phase encoding pulse is<br>
being changed, thereby collecting data from a plurality of<br>
echoes by one excitation, building a compensating pulse for<br>
compensating for the amount of the phase error measured by<br>
the phase error measuring method described in the above (1)<br>
in its corresponding phase encoding pulse, adding the same<br>

encoding pulse, incorporating the same in its corresponding<br>
rewind pulse, or adding the same to one or both immediately<br>
before or after the rewind pulse.<br>

process described in the above (2) , are equal to each other.<br>
However, a problem arises in that since the residual magnetization at the commencement of the measurement of the phase error and the residual magnetization at the commencement of the pulse sequence of the high-speed spin echo process are not always equal to each other, the precondition employed in the prior art is not established, and the phase error occurs due to the residual magnetization, thus causing degradation in image quality.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention will hereinafter be described in further details by embodiments  illustrated in the drawings. - First Embodiment -<br>
Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing an MRI system according to a first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In the present MRI system 100, a magnet assembly 1 has a space (hole) for:inserting a sample therein and is provided with a magnetostatic field coil lp for applying a constant static magnetic field to the sample, a gradient or gradient, magnetic field coil lg for generating gradient or gradient magnetic fields for a slice axis, a read axis and a phase axis, a transmitting coil It for supplying a RF pulse for exciting the spin of a nucleus in the sample, and a receiving coil lr for detecting an NMR signal from the sample, so as to surround the space. The magnetostatic field coil lp, gradient magnetic field coil lg, transmitting coil It and receiving coil lr are respectively electrically connected to a magnetostatic field source 2, a gradient or gradient magnetic field driving:circuit 3, a RF power amplifier 4 and a pre-amplifier 5.<br>
Incidentally, a permanent magnet may be used in place of the magnetostatic field coil lp.<br>
A sequence storage circuit 6 controls or operates the gradient magnetic field driving circuit 3, based on a pulse sequence stored therein in accordance with instructions given from a computer 7 to thereby generate a gradient magnetic field from the gradient magnetic field coil lg of the magnet assembly 1. Further, the sequence storage circuit 6 operates a gate modulator 8 to modulate a carrier output signal produced from a RF oscillator 9 to a pulsated signal represented in the form of a predetermined timing and predetermined envelope and adds it to the RF power amplifier 4 as a RF pulse, where it is power-amplified. Thereafter, the RF power amplifier 4 applies the pulse to the transmitting coil It of the magnet assembly '1 to select and excite a desired slice region.<br>
The pre-amplifier 5 amplifies an NMR signal from<br><br>
the sample, which is detected by the receiving coil lr of the magnet assembly 1, and inputs the amplified NMR signal to a phase detector 10. The phase detector 10 receives a carrier output signal produced from the RF oscillator 9 as a reference signal, phase-detects the NMR signal supplied from the pre-amplifier 5 and supplies it to an A/D converter l1. The A/D converter 11 converts the phase-detected analog signal to a digital signal and inputs it to the computer 7.<br>
The computer 7 reads data from the A/D converter 11 and performs an image reconstructing computation on the data to thereby generate an image for a desired slice region. The image is displayed on a display unit 13. Further, the computer 7 takes charge of the whole control such as the reception of information inputted through an operation console 12.<br>
Fig. 2 is a flowchart for describing a phase error measuring process according to the present invention.<br>
In Step El, data  of echo2 and echo3 are collected in accordance with a phase error measuring pre-scan sequence P128. of encode 0 with a positive stationary or steady-state pre-pulse as shown in Fig. 3.<br>
In the phase error measuring pre-scan sequence P128. shown in Fig. 3, a positive steady-state pre-pulse comprised of a negative saturated pulse ns and a positive steady-state pulse pp having an area equal to one-half that thereof is applied to a phase axis. Next, an excitation pulse R and a slice gradient ss are applied. A first inversion pulse PI and a slice gradient ss are next applied. Next, a read pulse gxr corresponding to a first half of a normal read pulse (see gxw in Fig. 9) is applied to a read axis.  Afterwards, the read pulse is set to "0".<br>
Next, a second inversion pulse P2 and a slice gradient ss are applied. Next, a dephaser pulse gywdnl is applied to the phase axis. Next, an NMR signal is received from an echol while a read pulse gywnl is being applied to the phase axis. Afterward, a rephaser pulse gywrnl equal to the dephaser pulse gywdnl is applied to the phase axis.<br>
Next, a third inversion pulse P3 and a slice gradient ss are applied. A dephaser pulse gywdn2 is next applied to the phase axis. Next, an NMR signal is received from an echo2 while a read pulse gywn2 is being applied to the phase axis. Thereafter, a rephaser pulse gywrn2 equal to the dephaser pulse gywdn2 is applied to the phase axis.<br>
Referring back to Fig. 2, in Step E2, the data of echo2 and echo3 are converted into one-dimensional Fourier form and the resultant respective phases are represented as Φ 2 and Φ 3 respectively.<br><br>
In Step E3, (Φ2. - Φ3)/2 is determined and it is fitted with a linear function to thereby obtain a primary term d128..<br>

echo.  Further, γ indicates a magnetic rotating ratio.  fov indicates the size (cm) of an imaging field of view.<br>
