				<td>MIXING HIGH TEMPERATURE GASES IN MINERAL KILNS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to method and apparatus for the improved<br>
operation efficiency and reduced emissions from mineral processing kilns and in<br>
particular those kilns wherein the processed mineral liberates gas during thermal<br>
processing. More particularly the invention is directed to the injection of high<br>
velocity/high energy air into the kiln gas stream to mix gas stream components and<br>
dissipate the released gases blanketing the mineral bed allowing for more efficient<br>
heat transfer to in-process the mineral and concomitantly to reduce pollutants in the<br>
kiln gas effluent stream.<br>
BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the widely used commercial process for the manufacture of cement,<br>
the steps of drying, calcining, and clinkering cement raw materials are accomplished<br>
by passing finely divided raw materials, including calcareous minerals, silica and<br>
alumina, through a heated, inclined rotary vessel or kiln. In what is known as<br>
conventional long dry or wet process kilns the entire mineral heating process is<br>
conducted in a heated rotating kiln cylinder, commonly referred to as a "rotary<br>
vessel." The rotary vessel is typically 10 to 15 feet in diameter and 200-700 feet in<br>
length and is inclined so that as the vessel is rotated, raw materials fed into the<br>
upper end of the kiln cylinder move under the influence of gravity toward the lower<br>
"fired" end where the final clinkering process takes place and where the product<br>
cement clinker is discharged for cooling and subsequent processing. Kiln gas<br>
temperatures in the fired clinkering zone of the kiln range from about 1300°C<br>
(~2400°F) to about 2200°C (~4000°F). Kiln gas exit temperatures are as low as<br>
about 250°C (~400°F) to 350°C (~650°F) at the upper mineral receiving end of<br>
so-called wet process kilns. Up to 1100°C (~2000°F) kiln gas temperatures exist in<br>
the upper end of dry process rotary kilns.<br>
Generally, skilled practitioners consider the cement making process<br>
within the rotary kiln to occur in several stages as the raw material flows from the<br>
cooler gas exit mineral feed end to the fired/clinker exit lower end of the rotary kiln<br>
vessel. As the mineral material moves down the length of the kiln it is subjected to<br>
increasing kiln gas temperatures. Thus in the upper portion of the kiln cylinder where<br>
the kiln gas temperatures are the lowest, the in-process mineral materials first undergo<br>
a drying/preheating process and thereafter move down the kiln cylinder until the<br>
temperature is raised to calcining temperature. The length of the kiln where the<br>
mineral is undergoing a calcining process (releasing carbon dioxide) is designated the<br>
calcining zone. The in-process mineral finally moves down the kiln into a zone where<br>
gas temperatures are the hottest, the clinkering zone at the fired lower end of the kiln<br>
cylinder. The kiln gas stream flows counter to the flow of in-process mineral<br>
materials from the clinkering zone, through the intermediate calcining zone and the<br>
mineral drying/preheating zone and out the upper gas exit end of the kiln into a kiln<br>
dust collection system. The flow of kiln gases through the kiln can be controlled to<br>
some extent by a draft induction fan positioned in the kiln gas exhaust stream. Over<br>
the last 10-20 years preheater/precalciner cement kilns have proven most significantly<br>
more energy efficient than the traditional long kilns. In precalciner kilns the raw<br>
mineral feed is heated to calcining temperatures in a stationary counterflow<br>
precalciner vessel before it drops into a heated rotary vessel for the higher temperature<br>
clinkering reactions.<br>
Responsive to environmental concerns and more rigorous regulating of<br>
emission standards, the mineral processing industry has invested in a significant<br>
research and development effort to reduce emissions from cement and other mineral<br>
processing kilns. The present invention provides a method and apparatus for<br>
improving thermal efficiency and reducing emission of gaseous pollutants during the<br>
manufacture of thermally processed mineral products such as cement and limestone.<br>
The invention finds application to both so-called long mineral<br>
processing kilns and, in the case of cement manufacture, precalciner kilns, already<br>
recognized for their energy efficient production of cement clinker. The invention<br>
provides advantage in the form of reduced emissions and enhanced energy efficiency<br>
in supplemental fuels, the thermal processing of gas releasing minerals including, but<br>
not limited to, talconite, limestone, cement raw materials, and clays for the production<br>
of light weight aggregates.<br>
In one aspect of the invention high energy/velocity air is injected into<br>
the kiln gas stream to reduce or eliminate stratification of gases in a kiln during<br>
thermal processing of a mineral that liberates a gas as it is processed.<br>
In another aspect of this invention kiln gas mixing energy is delivered<br>
to the kiln gas stream by injecting air at high velocity into rotary kilns in a manner<br>
designed to impart rotational momentum to the kiln gases in the rotary vessel. It has<br>
been found that injection of high velocity air to promote cross-sectional mixing in<br>
mineral processing kilns works to improve energy efficiency by facilitating energy<br>
transfer to the mineral bed, and concomitantly such air injection alters the<br>
stoichiometry and temperature profile of combustion in the primary combustion zone<br>
to reduce the formation of byproduct nitrogen oxides.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
method for reducing NOX emissions and improving energy efficiency during mineral<br>
processing in a rotary kiln. The kiln comprises an inclined rotary vessel having a<br>
primary burner and a combustion air inlet at its lower end and an upper end for<br>
introducing raw mineral feed. The method finds particular use wherein the mineral in<br>
a mineral bed in the rotary vessel undergoes a gas releasing chemical reaction during<br>
thermal processing in the kiln. The method comprises the step of injecting air into the<br>
rotary vessel at a velocity of about 100 to about 1000 feet per second, typically from<br>
an air pressurizing source providing a static pressure of greater than about 0.15<br>
atmospheres, and in one aspect of the invention, at a point along the lower one-half<br>
length of the rotary vessel, where the temperature difference between the kiln gases<br>
and the mineral are the greatest, to mix the gas released from the mineral with<br>
combustion gases from the primary burner. Preferably the mass flow rate of the<br>
injected air is about 1 to about 15% of the mass rate of use of combustion air by the<br>
kiln.<br>
In one embodiment air is injected into the rotary vessel preferably<br>
through an air injection tube extending from a port in the rotary vessel wall into the<br>
rotary vessel and terminating in a nozzle for directing the injected air along a<br>
predetermined path in the rotary vessel. Typically air is injected into the rotary vessel<br>
through two or more nozzles positioned in the rotary vessel at a distance of about H to<br>
about 2H from the wall of the rotary vessel wherein "H" is the maximum depth of the<br>
mineral bed in the vessel. Preferably the predetermined path of the injected air is<br>
directed to impart rotational momentum to the combustion gases flowing through the<br>
rotary vessel. In one aspect of the invention the method further comprises the step of<br>
burning supplemental fuel delivered into the rotary vessel downstream relative to kiln<br>
gas flow in the kiln from where the air is injected into the kiln. In still another<br>
embodiment of the invention the method further includes the step of injecting air into<br>
the rotary vessel at a velocity of about 100 to about 1000 feet per second at a point<br>
downstream, relative to gas flow in the kiln, from the supplemental fuel delivery port<br>
to mix the gas released from both the mineral bed and the burning supplemental fuel<br>
with the combustion gases from the primary burner. The rate of injection of air into<br>
the kiln is generally about 1% to about 15%, more typically about 1% to about 7% of<br>
the mass of the total combustion air required per unit time during kiln operation. In<br>
one particular embodiment of the invention the air injection nozzles have an orifice<br>
with an aspect ratio greater than 1, for example, an orifice of rectangular or elliptical<br>
cross-section.<br>
In another aspect of the invention there is provided a method for<br>
reducing NOX emissions and improving combustion efficacy in a preheater/precalciner<br>
(PH/PC) cement kiln. The precalciner kiln has a rotary vessel portion having a<br>
primary burner combustion zone and a stationary precalciner vessel portion having<br>
secondary burner combustion zone. Each of the primary burner and the precalciner<br>
portion is supplied with controlled amounts of preheated combustion air. In operation<br>
the combustion gases from the primary combustion zone flows serially through the<br>
rotary vessel, the precalciner vessel portion and into a series of cyclones in counter-<br>
flow communication with a mineral feed. The method of the present invention as<br>
applied to a precalciner kiln comprises the step of injecting compressed air into the<br>
precalciner vessel portion of the kiln at a point before the first cyclone, at a mass rate<br>
corresponding to about 1% to about 7 % of the total combustion air per unit time<br>
required by the kiln. Preferably the air is injected at a velocity of about 100 to about<br>
1000 feet per second through two or more air injection nozzles. In one embodiment<br>
the air is compressed to a pressure of about 4 to about 150, more typically about 40 to<br>
about 100 pounds per square inch before being injected into the precalciner vessel<br>
portion. Preferably the nozzles are directed into the precalciner vessel to optimize<br>
cross-sectional mixing of the contained gases and fluidized mineral. In one<br>
embodiment the nozzles are positioned to promote turbulent flow in the vessel and in<br>
another embodiment the nozzles are directed into the precalciner vessel to promote<br>
rotational or cyclonic flow in said vessel.<br>
In an alternate embodiment of the present invention there is provided a<br>
modified precalciner cement kiln wherein the modifications comprise an air injection<br>
nozzle positioned in or on the stationary precalciner vessel and means for delivering<br>
compressed air to the nozzle and into the vessel at a linear velocity of about 100 to<br>
about 1000 feet per second. Preferably the modified kiln is fitted with a plurality of<br>
nozzles positioned to deliver compressed air into the precalciner vessel.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention there is provided a<br>
mineral processing kiln modified for operation with reduced NOX emissions and<br>
increased energy efficiency. The kiln comprises an inclined rotary vessel having a<br>
primary burner and combustion air inlet at its lower end. The kiln finds particular<br>
application to the thermal processing of minerals that undergo a gas releasing<br>
chemical reaction during thermal processing. The kiln is modified to include an air<br>
injection tube for injecting air into the rotary vessel at a velocity of about 100 to about<br>
1000 feet per second. The injection tube extends from a port in the wall of the vessel<br>
and into the rotary vessel terminating in a nozzle for directing the injected air along a<br>
predetermined path in the vessel. The port is preferably located at a point along the<br>
lower one-half length of the rotary vessel to mix gas released from the mineral bed<br>
with combustion gases from the primary burner. Additional modifications of the kiln<br>
include a fan or compressor in air flow communication with the air injection tube and<br>
a controller for the fan or compressor to adjust the rate of air injection into the kiln.<br>
The fan or compressor can be stationary and in air flow communication with the port<br>
in the wall of the vessel via, for example, an annular plenum aligned with the path of<br>
the port during rotation of the vessel. Alternatively, the fan or compressor can be<br>
mounted on the wall of the rotary vessel for direct air injection into the kiln. Power is<br>
delivered to fan or compressor mounted on the surface of the vessel via a<br>
circumferential power ring.<br>
Preferably the modified mineral processing kiln is modified to include<br>
two or more air injection tubes for injecting air into the rotary vessel, each injection<br>
tube terminating in an nozzle for directing the injected air along a predetermined path<br>
in the vessel. Preferably the nozzle or nozzles are positioned in the rotary vessel at a<br>
distance of about H to about 2H from the wall of the rotary vessel wherein "H" is the<br>
maximum depth of the mineral bed in the rotary kiln vessel. The air injection nozzles<br>
are preferably positioned so that the predetermined path of the injected air from each<br>
nozzle works to impart rotational momentum to the combustion gases flowing<br>
through the rotary vessel.<br>
The air injection tubes can be mounted to extend from the port into the<br>
rotary vessel perpendicular to a tangent to the rotary vessel at the port and terminate in<br>
a nozzle for directing the injected air along a predetermined path in the vessel selected<br>
to impart rotational momentum to the kiln gas stream. Alternatively, the injection<br>
tube(s) can be positioned to extend from the port in the rotary vessel into the vessel at<br>
an acute angle to a tangent at the port and substantially perpendicular to a radius line<br>
of the rotary vessel extending through the end of the rube. Air injection tubes so<br>
configured work to direct the injected air across the kiln gas stream to impart<br>
rotational momentum to the kiln gas stream at the point of injection. In one<br>
embodiment, the orifice of the injection tube is formed to have an aspect ratio greater<br>
than one.<br>
The injection tube is formed to communicate with a source of<br>
pressurized air, preferably a fan, blower, or compressor capable of providing a static<br>
pressure differential of greater than about 0.15 atmospheres, preferably greater than<br>
about 0.20 atmospheres. The fan, blower, or compressor is sized and powered<br>
sufficiently to deliver injected air continuously into the kiln with a kinetic energy<br>
input of about 1 to about 10 watt/hour per pound of injected air (corresponding to<br>
about 0.1 to about 1 watt/hour per pound of kiln gas). The size of the orifice of the air<br>
injection nozzles are selected so that the mass flow rate of injected air at the applied<br>
static pressure is about 1 to about 15%, more preferably about 1 to about 10% into the<br>
rotary vessel or about 1 to about 7% where air is injected into the stationary<br>
preheater/precalciner portion). The linear velocity of the injected air typically ranges<br>
from about 100 feet per second to about 1000 feet per second.<br>
In one embodiment the modified mineral processing kiln further<br>
comprises a supplemental fuel delivery port and a tube extending from the port into<br>
the rotary vessel at a point on the vessel downstream, relative to gas flow in the kiln,<br>
from the location of the air injection tube. The kiln can be further modified to include<br>
one or more additional air injection tubes for injecting air into the rotary vessel at high<br>
velocity under the influence of a fan or compressor in gas flow communication with<br>
the air injection tube. The injection tube terminates in a nozzle for directing the<br>
injected air along a predetermined path in the vessel. The air injection tube is located<br>
at a point on the rotary vessel downstream, relative to gas flow into the kiln, from the<br>
supplemental fuel delivery port to mix gases released from both the mineral bed and<br>
the burning supplemental fuel with the combustion gases from the primary burner. A<br>
controller is provided for the fan or compressor to adjust the rate of air injection into<br>
the kiln at the downstream air injection point.<br>
In one other aspect of the invention there is provided a method for<br>
reducing NOX in the effluent gas stream from a long rotary cement kirn modified for<br>
burning supplemental fuel. The kiln in operation comprises an inclined cylindrical<br>
vessel rotating about its long axis. The vessel is heated at its lower end by primary<br>
burner and charged with raw material at its upper end. A kiln gas stream flows from<br>
the heated lower end having a primary burner and a combustion air inlet through the<br>
upper end of the vessel. The in-process mineral material forms a mineral bed flowing<br>
at a maximum depth H under the influence of gravity in the vessel counter-current to<br>
the kiln gas; stream from a drying zone in the upper most portion of the rotary vessel.<br>
The mineral bed flows through an intermediate calcining zone, and into a high<br>
temperature clinkering zone before exiting the lower end as cement clinker.<br>
Supplemental fuel is charged into the vessel through a port and a drop tube in<br>
communication with the port in the vessel wall to bum in contact with calcining<br>
mineral in a secondary burning zone coincident with at least a portion of the calcining<br>
zone. Application of the present invention to reduce NOX in the effluent gas stream<br>
from the kiln comprises the step of injecting air at a velocity of about 100 to about<br>
1000 feet per second through an air injection tube extending from a port in the vessel<br>
and terminating in a nozzle for directing the injected air along a predetermined path in<br>
the vessel. The air injection port is located at a point downstream relative to kiln gas<br>
flow of the clinkering zone and upstream relative to kiln gas flow of the upper end of<br>
the calcining zone. The air injection nozzle is positioned in the vessel a distance from<br>
about H to about 2H from the wall of the vessel and the predetermined path of the<br>
injected air preferably forms an angle of greater than 45 degrees with a line segment<br>
parallel to the rotational axis of the vessel and extending from the point of injection<br>
through the mineral feed in the vessel. The rate of injection of the air into the vessel<br>
is controlled to be about 1% to about 10% of the mass of the total combustion air used<br>
per unit time during kiln operation.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In accordance with the present invention air is injected into a mineral<br>
processing rotary kiln to deliver energy to the gases in the kiln to achieve cross<br>
sectional mixing. This invention provides for injection of air for the purpose of<br>
elimination of stratification of gases in a kiln that during operation is processing a<br>
mineral that liberates a gas as it is processed such as kilns processing limestone,<br>
cement raw mix, clays as in lightweight aggregate kilns, and taconite kilns. The<br>
primary purpose of the injected air is to provide energy for mixing of the gases being<br>
liberated from the in-process mineral with the combustion gases coming from the<br>
combustion zone of the kiln and accordingly there are a multiplicity of elements<br>
specified for this invention which cooperate in whole or in part to achieve the kiln gas<br>
cross-sectional mixing effect that provides the advantages realized in use of the<br>
invention in a wide variety of mineral processing kilns.<br>
The present invention specifies injection of air for the purpose of<br>
reducing or eliminating the stratification of gases in a kiln. A typical kiln is from<br>
eight feet to over twenty feet in diameter and has a length to diameter ratios of 10:1 to<br>
over 40:1. Materials typically calcined are Portland cement raw materials, clays,<br>
limestone, taconite, and other mineral materials that are thermally processed and<br>
liberate gases upon heating. The purpose of the injected air in this invention is to<br>
provide energy for cross-sectional mixing; the air has little, if any, function of<br>
providing oxygen for combustion. It is common for mineral processing kilns, like<br>
cement and lime kilns, to control the oxygen content in the exhaust gases to as low a<br>
level as practical and yet avoid the formation of significant amounts of carbon<br>
monoxide or sulfur dioxide. It is desirable to operate in this manner to maximize<br>
thermal efficiency. Thermal efficiency can be adversely affected by operating with<br>
two little combustion air, resulting in incomplete combustion of the fuel, or excess<br>
combustion air, which results in increased heat losses.<br>
It is desirable to introduce the combustion air for mineral processing<br>
through a heat recuperator that recovers the heat from the processed mineral product<br>
discharged from the kiln. The heat recovered in the incoming combustion air can be a<br>
substantial portion of the total energy supplied to the process. The injection of<br>
ambient air into the kiln gas stream, at a location other than the primary combustion<br>
zone normally would not be considered favorable due to the negative impact it might<br>
have on hear recovery; inherently injected air is substituted for combustion air drawn<br>
through the heat recuperator.<br>
Computer modeling of calcining kilns revealed that the gases being<br>
liberated by the mineral being processed remains stratified in the kiln. Compared to<br>
the hot gases coming from the primary combustion zone at the material discharge end<br>
of the counterflow mineral processing kilns, the liberated gases are much lower in<br>
temperature and often of higher molecular weight and much higher in density. As a<br>
result of this difference in density, these liberated gases remain at the bottom of the<br>
kiln. In addition to the gases liberated from the calcining mineral, there may also be<br>
combustible substances liberated either from the mineral feed or as fuel added to the<br>
process to the mid-portion of the kiln. The liberated gases blanket and shield these<br>
combustible materials from the oxygen content in the gases at the upper levels of the<br>
kiln gas stream. This blanket of low temperature gases also shields the mineral bed<br>
from direct contact with the hot combustion gases. Therefore, the process is required<br>
to use an indirect method of heating. The kiln walls are heated by the hot combustion<br>
gases and the rotation of the kiln results in the contact of the hot walls with the<br>
mineral bed. By the means of this invention, a small portion of the total process air,<br>
less than 15 percent, is injected into the rotary vessel in a way that produces a<br>
rotational component to the momentum of the kiln gas stream in the kiln. This .<br>
rotational component results in the hot gases that were traveling along the top of the<br>
kiln to be forced down on the bed of the calcining mineral, pushing off the blanket of<br>
cool liberated gases. This contacting of hot gases with the mineral bed adds another<br>
mechanism of transfer, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the process to the<br>
kiln.<br>
The kinetic energy of the injected air and the resulting rotational<br>
momentum results in the liberated gases being mixed with the hot combustion gases<br>
and any residual oxygen from these gases and the injected air. This cross-sectional<br>
mixing results in the oxidation of combustible components that may have been<br>
contained in the blanket of gas. Thus, the emissions of the unburnt components, like<br>
carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and hydrocarbons, can be reduced at a given excess<br>
air level. Or, the prior emission levels can be maintained at a reduced level of excess<br>
air resulting in improved process efficiency. The benefit of the new mechanism of<br>
heat transfer and the reduced excess air mitigates the negative energy recovery impact<br>
from the portion of air that bypasses the recuperator.<br>
The air injection mechanism of this invention is located at a point<br>
along the kiln where there is a significant difference between the combustion gas<br>
temperature and the temperature of the mineral bed. Typically, this would be a<br>
location in the kiln as close to the combustion zone as practical, limited by the service<br>
temperature limit of the apparatus, expected to be about 2800°F, to a position at the<br>
cooler end of the calcining zone limited by a temperature adequate to allow<br>
combustion after mixing occurs, about 1600°F to about 1850°F. In one embodiment<br>
of the invention, the air injection tube is located in the hottest half portion (the lower<br>
half) of the rotary vessel. Given the nature of most minerals calcined in rotary kilns,<br>
the benefit will also be obtained by installing the apparatus in the calcining zone to<br>
break up and eliminate the stratification. The apparatus can also be placed at the<br>
lower end where the mineral is almost completely calcined, to disrupt the formation of<br>
the high-density gaseous blanket on the in-process mineral. Multiple air injection<br>
tubes, either circumferential displaced, axially displaced, or both axially and<br>
circumferentially displaced, can be located on the kiln. They can each be<br>
independently connected to a fan, blower or compressor or they can be in air injection<br>
flow communication with a pressurized manifold.<br>
It is also possible to take advantage of the oxygen content in the<br>
injected air to create staged combustion for the purpose of controlling nitrogen oxides.<br>
Because of the above-noted lost energy recovery in the combustion air, staged<br>
combustion in mineral processing rotary kilns is not practiced due to the perceived<br>
high-energy penalty. Rotary kilns, such as incinerators or coke processing kilns, may<br>
practice staged combustion, but such kilns do not have a high amount of recoverable<br>
energy in their discharge product and thereby do not have the functional limitations of<br>
mineral processing kilns. Also, due to the improved efficiency of combustion, less .<br>
excess air is required to achieve complete combustion. The enhanced mixing and<br>
resulting lack of combustion stratification in the kiln will allow the achievement of<br>
staged combustion with quantities of excess air that do not unduly upset the process<br>
energy requirements. High-energy injection of air for cross-sectional mixing enables<br>
the use of staged combustion in mineral processing kirns for emission control.<br>
With reference Figs. 1-4 mineral processing kilns 10 include a rotary<br>
vessel 12 having a cylindrical wall 14, a lower combustion air inlet/burner end 16 and<br>
an upper gas exit end 18. In operation raw mineral feed 20 is delivered to the gas exit<br>
end 18 and with rotation of rotary vessel 12 the mineral bed moves from the gas exit<br>
end 18 toward the air inlet/burner end 16 flowing counter-current to combustion<br>
products forming the kirn gas stream. Burner 24 is supplied with primary fuel source<br>
26, and combustion air is drawn from hear recuperator 30 through hood 28 into<br>
combustion air inlet end 16. The processed mineral exits the combustion air inlet end<br>
16 and is delivered to heat recuperator 30. One or more air injection tubes 32 in air<br>
flow communication with a fan, blower or compressor 34 are location along the<br>
length of rotary vessel 12 at points where the in-process mineral in mineral bed 22 is<br>
calcining or where the temperature differences between the kiln gas stream and<br>
mineral bed are the most extreme, most typically in the lower most one-half portion of<br>
rotary vessel 12, the portion more proximal to the combustion air inlet/burner end 16<br>
than the gas exit end 18. Air injection tubes 32 terminate in the rotary vessel as a<br>
nozzle 26 positioned to direct the injected air along a path designed to impart<br>
rotational momentum to the kiln gas stream. Orifice 38 in nozzle 36, in one<br>
embodiment of the invention, has an aspect ratio greater than one (See Figs. 8a and 8b<br>
illustrating orifices of rectangular cross-section).<br>
With reference to Figs. 3 and 4, the mineral processing kiln can be<br>
further modified to bum supplemental fuel delivered from supplemental fuel source<br>
40 through fuel delivery device 42 into the rotary vessel to burn in contact with the in-<br>
process mineral in mineral bed 22. In one embodiment of the invention, air is injected<br>
to impart rotational momentum to the kiln gas stream at a point between fuel delivery<br>
device 42 and combustion air inlet/burner end 16. Optionally air is injected at one or<br>
more additional points on rotary vessel 12 between the supplemental fuel delivery<br>
device 42 and gas exit end 18.<br>
With reference to Figs. 5 and 6, two or more air injection tubes 32 can<br>
be circumferentially (or axially) on the cylindrical wall 14 of rotary vessel 12.<br>
Pressurized air is delivered to the injection tubes by fan or blower 34 in air flow<br>
communication through manifold 46. Alternatively, as depicted in Fig. 7, each<br>
injection tube can be connected directly to a blower or fan 34 for delivery of high<br>
energy/velocity air into the kiln gas stream. The air injection tubes 34 terminate in the<br>
kiln at a point between the top of mineral bed 22 and the axis of rotation of rotary<br>
vessel 12 in the form of a nozzle for directing high energy injected air 50 into the<br>
rotary vessel to impart rotational momentum to the kiln gas stream.<br>
With reference to Fig. 9b, by injecting high energy air into the kiln to<br>
produce rotational momentum in the kiln gas stream supplemental fuel elements 52<br>
burning in the kiln gas stream are continuously cleared of their own combustion<br>
products and contacted with mixed kiln gases to provide more favorable conditions<br>
for combustion and energy transfer.<br>
With reference to Figs. 14 and 15, injection of high energy mixing air<br>
effective to impart rotational momentum in the kiln gas stream works to dissipate<br>
stratified layers produced, for example, by calcining mineral in the mineral bed 22.<br>
With removable or dissipation of the more dense carbon dioxide strata normally<br>
covering mineral bed 22 radiant energy from the kiln gas stream and the cylindrical<br>
walls 14 of rotary vessel 12 reaches the bed to allow more efficient energy transfer ..<br>
between the kiln gas stream and the end process mineral. (See Fig. 16).<br>
With reference to Figs. 17 through 20 illustrating various<br>
configurations of the stationary portions of preheater/precalciner kilns, there is<br>
indicated points 70 for injection of high pressure air into the stationary portions to<br>
create either turbulent flow or rotational momentum in the gas stream flowing through<br>
those stationary portions. Thus air can be injected at high pressure/energy, for<br>
example, from a compressor, through one or more nozzles located in the walls of the<br>
stationary portion of a preheater/precalciner kiln to provide mixing energy with<br>
consequent reduction of pollutants associated with stratification and localized<br>
combustion heterogeneity in such precalciner equipment.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, referring to Figs. 21 and 22 the<br>
kiln gas stream is monitored for emissions contents/profile at or near the gas exit end<br>
18 of rotary vessel 12 to provide signals characteristic of said emission profile for<br>
input to one or more controllers for the kiln including an air injection controller or air<br>
injection controller and a controller for injecting steam or flue gas into the kirn gas<br>
stream to provide thermal ballast to the kiln gas stream.<br>
In one application of the present invention illustrated in Fig. 23, air<br>
injector units 31 are positioned within two kiln diameters of the gas exit end 18 of<br>
rotary vessel 12 in a preheater/precalciner kiln pen. The temperature of the kiln gas<br>
stream at the point of air injection is about 2200 to about 1800°F. Supplemental fuel<br>
58 is sprayed from supplemental fuel delivery tube 60 connected to fuel source 62 to<br>
create reducing conditions in the high-energy injection air-mixed kiln gas stream at<br>
the gas exit end 18 of the rotary vessel 12 to effect reduction in NOX emissions from<br>
the preheater/precalciner kiln.<br>
Example 1<br>
Staged Combustion               Lime kiln<br>
Staged combustion can be accomplished by several means. For<br>
example, a kiln is operating with about zero to five percent of the air in excess of what<br>
is required for combustion. At this level of excess air, some residual carbon<br>
monoxide, and sulfur dioxide are produced. Further reduction of excess air to the<br>
combustion zone to reduce formation of nitrogen oxides would result in an<br>
undesirable emission of carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide and the loss of thermal<br>
efficiency due to incomplete combustion of the fuel. By installing the apparatus of<br>
the invention and injection 10% of the total combustion air to the process, the<br>
available air in the primary combustion zone would be insufficient to" completely<br>
combust the fuel, and the gases leaving this zone would have significant<br>
concentrations of carbon monoxide and other species that are products of incomplete<br>
combustion. Nitrogen oxides are reduced even though the primary combustion zone<br>
remains at high temperature since the products of incomplete combustion<br>
preferentially draw the available oxygen or can even draw the oxygen from nitrogen<br>
oxide.<br>
Since the total air flow remain is at 100-105% of that needed for<br>
combustion, the injection of 10% at mid-kiln results in only 90-95% of the required<br>
combustion air in the primary combustion zone. The additional air is injected at a<br>
temperature zone of the kiln where it is still sufficiently hot enough to rapidly<br>
complete combustion when available oxygen becomes available yet not so hot as to<br>
form nitrogen oxides. The 10% of combustion air is injected with sufficient energy to<br>
mix the cross-section of combustion gas in the kiln. This results in 0-5% air in excess<br>
of that required for combustion, which will minimize residual carbon monoxide and<br>
sulfur dioxide. This mixing zone is not at as high of temperature as the primary<br>
combustion zone, therefore, nitrogen oxides are not formed even though there is now<br>
excess oxygen in this zone.<br>
Example 2<br>
The use of mixing air for improving the efficiency of combustion is<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 5,632,616, which claims the use of mixing air in<br>
conjunction with mid-kiln firing. The use of tangential injection of high energy air to<br>
create a rotational component of the bulk gas in the kiln enhances mixing air efficacy<br>
when the injection occurs upstream (downhill) of the fuel injection point.<br>
Example 3<br>
The mixing air concept was developed as a result of the identification<br>
of the stratification of gases in the kiln. The heaver carbon dioxide and the pyrolysis<br>
gases form the mid-kiln fuel will remain stratified on the bottom of the kiln and the<br>
high temperature gases containing oxygen are stratified at the top.<br>
The cross-sectional mixing obtained by the method of injection of the<br>
mixing air allows burn-out of the residual products of incomplete combustion when<br>
the device is placed downstream (uphill) of the fuel injection point. For nitrogen<br>
oxide reduction, it is essential to also get cross-sectional mixing of the gases when<br>
they are still depleted in oxygen. Therefore, a mixing air system is installed upstream<br>
(downhill) from the mid-kiln firing point to impart a rotational momentum to the kiln<br>
gases to mix the plume of the combusting and pyrolyzing fuel throughout the kiln<br>
gases.<br>
The ideal kiln system would have been two air injection systems, one<br>
upstream of the mid-kiln fuel injection to get cross-sectional mixing while the kiln<br>
gases are still depleted in oxygen, and another downstream to get cross-sectional<br>
mixing with the injected air to get burn-out of any residual products of incomplete<br>
combustion.<br>
The examples suggest that the combustion air is 5% less than that<br>
sufficient to complete combustion in the reducing zone. In practice, it would be<br>
expected that achieving only 1 or 2% deficiency in combustion air would suffice in<br>
controlling nitrogen oxide emissions.<br>
Example 4<br>
The use of a small quantity of high-pressure air injected to enhance<br>
mixing can also be applied to precalciner cement kilns. Precalciner cement kilns use<br>
secondary firing and can be. modified to introduce some combustion air after the<br>
secondary firing zone to create staged combustion. However, such modifications are<br>
costly. Also, because of the power required to move the combustion gases through a<br>
precalciner kiln, these systems are designed to operate with low pressure drops. Thus,<br>
the systems are not designed to optimize mixing and use long retention times to get<br>
adequate mixing. The performance of these kiln systems could be enhanced by<br>
introducing energy by means of very high velocity (pressure) mixing air. Pressures of<br>
about 4 to about 150, more typically about 40 to 100 psi could be used to introduce<br>
significant amounts of energy to create good mixing in a short time. With the very<br>
high pressures, the energy introduction can be achieved with only a few percent of the<br>
total combustion air (1% to 5%). Hundreds of horsepower of energy could be put into<br>
mixing without increasing the overall pressure drop of the precalciner system: The<br>
quantities of air required are kept limited in order to minimize the quantity of air<br>
displaced from the heat recuperator. Increasing the mixing efficiency can increase<br>
combustion efficiency and allow the reduction in excess air required to get the desired<br>
levels of residual carbon monoxide. This reduction in excess air overall, and the<br>
excess air reduced by the substitution after the primary combustion zone results in<br>
less oxygen available in the combustion zone which will favorably minimize nitrogen<br>
oxide formation. With increasing mixing air substitution, the primary combustion<br>
zone could become substoichiometric resulting in an atmosphere that favorably<br>
destroys nitrogen oxides produced in the high temperature rotary kiln and pass<br>
through the precalciner.<br>
Effect of Mixing Air on the Process<br>
The gases inside a calcining kiln are highly stratified due to the<br>
temperature and resulting density differences between the combustion gases and the<br>
gases being liberated from the in-process mineral. As a result there is no direct<br>
contact of the hot combustion gases with the mineral bed. Heat transfer occurs<br>
indirectly by the hot gases heating the kiln walls and the hot walls are rotated under<br>
the mineral bed as the kiln turns. There may also be radiation from the hot gases to<br>
the mineral bed, but this mechanism becomes minor as the combustion gas cool from<br>
the peak temperatures in the primary combustion zone. The injection of high pressure<br>
air in a manner that imparts a rotational momentum to the kiln gases will add another<br>
mechanism of heat transfer to the calcining kiln as it will bring the hot combustion<br>
gases that were traveling along the top of the kiln down into contact with the mineral<br>
bed. This additional heat transfer mechanism will serve to improve the thermal<br>
efficiency of the calcining device.<br>
The injection of ambient air into the kiln at mid-process displaces air<br>
that comes from the heat recuperator that recovers heat in the discharged product into<br>
the combustion air. The reduction in air from the heat recuperator may effect the<br>
efficiency of this heat recuperation, therefore it is desirable to minimize the amount of<br>
mixing air added mid-process. This requires that the mixing air be injected at high<br>
pressure so that it has sufficient kinetic energy to impart a rotational component to the<br>
bulk kiln gases.<br>
Fuel Penalty of High Energy Air Jets on a Precalciner Kiln<br>
It is commonly believed that injections of unheated air into the cement<br>
process downstream of the cooler and the resulting displacement of air from the<br>
cooler will result in unacceptable loss of heat recovery. On closer examination<br>
calculations reveal that such loss of heat recovery is minimal, especially in view of the<br>
benefits of mixing the process gases in high temperature zones. Calculations show<br>
that if 10% of the theoretical combustion air is introduced with high energy into the<br>
rotary kiln, the displacement of a corresponding mass of preheated air would result in<br>
a reduction of the heat recovery from the cooler of less than 2% of the total energy<br>
input. The potential gain in process efficiency due to elimination of stratification can<br>
more than offset this heat loss.<br>
Burning of Tires in a Precalciner Kiln<br>
Whole tires can be introduced onto the feed chute or dropped with<br>
enough momentum that they roll into the upper end of the rotary vessel kiln. The<br>
firing rate of tires in a secondary burning zone at the upper end of the rotary vessel of<br>
a precalciner kiln is limited by the requirement to reduce the fuel at the main burner<br>
by a corresponding amount. The resulting increase in the air-to-fuel ratio results in a<br>
cooling of the main flame and inadequate flame temperatures occur at about a 20%<br>
substitution rate. Other problems occur as a result of the stratification of gases in the<br>
kiln exit. The tires lie at the bottom of the kiln vessel where there is inadequate<br>
oxygen to complete combustion. As a result, combustible rich gas enters the inlet<br>
chamber above the feed shelf where some mixing occurs with the oxygen containing<br>
gases from the top of the kiln. The resulting combustion in the inlet chamber creates<br>
localized high temperatures and results in unacceptable buildups in the inlet chamber.<br>
With the use of high energy air jets introducing up to about 10% of the<br>
combustion air with a rotational momentum near the upper end of the rotary vessel,<br>
the substitution rate of the whole tires can be increased to 30% of the kiln fuel without<br>
unacceptable main flame temperature or buildups. Further, the air-jet mixing<br>
produces a more uniform distribution of the reduced oxygen gases created by the<br>
burning tires to promote more effective NOX reduction. The improvement in the<br>
mixing of the kiln gases minimizes the potential for unacceptable buildup in the inlet<br>
chamber.<br>
Polysius Fuel Injection at Precalciner Exit to Control NOx<br>
One method of destroying NOX generated in the high temperature zone<br>
of a mineral processing kiln is to produce a substoichiometric zone at a temperature of<br>
1800° to 2500°F at some point downstream. This can be conveniently done by<br>
introducing a hydrocarbon fuel at the kiln exit as described by Polysius. A limitation<br>
of this technique is the fact that the exit gases of the kiln are highly stratified. The<br>
gases at the top of the kiln are hotter and higher in oxygen content, and the gas<br>
traveling along the bottom of the kiln is cooler and enriched with the carbon dioxide<br>
from the residual calcium carbonate in the hot mean entering the kiln and possibly<br>
rich with carbon monoxide from any carbon introduced from the precalciner.<br>
The function of the injected fuel can be enhanced by achieving a<br>
uniform distribution of the reducing zone on the cross-section of the duct. By<br>
injecting mixing energy by the means of air jets in the rotary kiln to break up the<br>
stratification in the rotary kiln provides a more uniform gas composition to the<br>
reducing zone. Further mixing of the injected fuel and the resulting reducing zone can<br>
be achieved by use of additional high energy air injection jets in the stationery portion<br>
of the kiln proximal to the gas exit end of the rotary vessel. (See Fig. 23.)<br>
Improvement of Heat Transfer in a Rotary Kiln<br>
Lime Kiln Example:<br>
The gases in the calcining zone of a lime kiln are highly stratified. In a<br>
12' diameter kiln (11' I.D.) The gas velocity through the kiln is typically 30 to 50 feet<br>
per second. The gas temperature over the calcining limestone bed is 1800° to 4000°<br>
and the limestone bed and the released carbon dioxide (molecular weight of 44 vs.<br>
combustion gases of 29) are at the calcining temperature of 1560°F (~850°C). As a<br>
result of the large density difference between the hot combustion gases and the<br>
released carbon dioxide, the mineral bed remains blanketed in carbon dioxide. Heat<br>
transfer occurs by radiation and by the heated kiln wall being rotated under the<br>
mineral bed.<br>
A high energy jet that introduces a rotational component to the kiln gas<br>
velocity results in the carbon dioxide layer being wiped off the calcining material.<br>
This allows direct contact of the hot combustion gases with the mineral bed. Because<br>
of the greater surface area now available and the greater temperature differences<br>
between the combustion gases and the in-process mineral (as compared to the kiln<br>
wall) heat transfer rate is increased.<br>
These high energy jets break up the stratification that was formed and<br>
the rotational component induced by the jets prevents the reformation of the stratified<br>
layer.<br>
By bringing the hot, oxygen containing kiln gases in contact with the<br>
mineral bed, combustible components in the bed that were previously blanketed with<br>
carbon dioxide are now able to combust. These combustible components can be<br>
naturally occurring in the mineral being processed, or be a result of solid fuel<br>
introduced to provide energy for the process.<br>
There are many benefits that can be gained by the process by breaking<br>
up the stratification that is inherent with mineral beds in rotary kilns.<br>
Early Mixing Air Application - NOx Reduction and Destruction By Air Injection<br>
Downstream From Secondary Burning Zone<br>
NOX reduction in a long wet or long dry cement kiln has been<br>
successfully accomplished using a mid-kiln secondary burning zone. About 10 years<br>
ago the mid-kiln fuel injection technology was pioneered to allow a cement kiln to<br>
burn energy-bearing solid waste materials such as whole tires. One of the side<br>
benefits of that technology was an approximate 30% reduction in NO. emissions.<br>
NOX emissions are the result of the combustion process used to<br>
produce cement. The high temperatures and oxidizing conditions required to make<br>
cement also form nitrogen oxides. Consequently, while the kiln is running it will<br>
produce some level of NOX. The level of NOX formed is dependent on many factors,<br>
but it is predictable. Within each kiln, increases and decreases in the NOX emission<br>
levels are typically related to the rise and fall in the temperature of the burning zone.<br>
The majority at NOX is formed from one of two different mechanisms within the<br>
burning zone. The first is high temperature oxidation of atmospheric nitrogen, and<br>
the second is the oxidation of nitrogen-bearing compounds in the fuel. Most of the<br>
NOX emissions from a cement kiln are thermal NOX. In general, thermal NOX is<br>
formed by the direct oxidation of atmospheric nitrogen at very high temperatures.<br>
This reaction is very sensitive to temperature. As the temperature increases, so does<br>
the rate of reaction. The second source of NOX emissions are nitrogen containing<br>
compounds in fuel. Typical coal contains approximately 1.5% nitrogen by weight.<br>
These compounds undergo a complex series of reactions, which result in a portion of<br>
this nitrogen being converted into NOX. This set of reactions is consistent throughout<br>
the combustion process and is relatively unaffected by temperature. Fuel-rich flames<br>
tend to decrease the production of fuel NOX, and oxygen-rich flames tend to increase<br>
or favor fuel NOX production. In the burning zone ofa kiln where oxidizing<br>
conditions are required for proper clinker mineralogy, the combustion process favors<br>
the production of fuel NOX. There are some other mechanisms that produce NOX<br>
Normally their effects are relatively insignificant compared to thermal and fuel NOX<br>
Mid-kiln fuel injection system has a proven history of providing<br>
significant NOX reduction in a long wet or long dry cement kiln. It takes advantage of<br>
recognized technology of staged combustion, in that a portion of the fuel is burned in<br>
a secondary combustion zone that is near the middle of the long wet or long dry kiln.<br>
After studying the effects of mid-kiln fuel injection on a cement kiln, it has been<br>
determined that it has a direct effect on the thermal NOX formation mechanism. It<br>
lowers the peak flame temperature, which decreases the NOX emission rate and in<br>
addition, there is the opportunity for re-burn of NOX created in the high temperature<br>
zone of the kiln, in the lower temperature secondary combustion zone.<br>
In this invention, injection of approximately 10% of the total<br>
combustion air through a nozzle, preferably one having an orifice with an aspect ratio<br>
of greater than one, into the kiln downstream of the secondary burning zone. At high<br>
velocity (from a pressurizing source capable of providing a static pressure differential<br>
of at least 0.15 atm, more preferably at least 0.20 atm) and at an angle to the kiln gas<br>
flow to impart a rotational component to the kiln gases. This rotational component<br>
provides much better cross-sectional mixing in the kiln. By mixing the kiln gases,<br>
improved combustion and lower emissions are produced. The mixing air injection<br>
affects NOX by changing the dynamics of airflow within the kiln. By adding the<br>
mixing air into the airflow downstream of the mid-kiln fuel entry point, the amount of<br>
excess air between the main flame and the mixing air fan can be altered. In this<br>
example, the mid-kiln fuel now uses the remaining excess air after the primary<br>
burner, and by the mid-kiln fuel entry point, there is no excess air in the kiln. This<br>
situation now provides the opportunity for chemical de-NOx. The mixing air then<br>
adds 10% excess air back into the kiln, and provides an opportunity for oxidizing re-<br>
burn of the residual products of incomplete combustion.<br>
