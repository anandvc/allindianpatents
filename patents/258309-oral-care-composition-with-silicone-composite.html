				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION ORAL CARE COMPOSITION WITH SILICONE COMPOSITE<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION [0001] This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/796,383, filed on 1 May 2006, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] Dental plaque or plaque bio-film is a soft deposit that forms on surfaces of the oral cavity, such as tissue and teeth, and comprises a complex mixture of an accumulation of bacteria and salivary as well as food by-products, starch, proteins and proteinacious material. Thus, inhibiting the growth of bio-film not only involves dispersing the accumulation of existing proteinacious materials, but also requires prohibiting and minimizing their reattachment to the tooth surface. Plaque adheres tenaciously at the points of irregularity or discontinuity (e.g., on rough calculus surfaces, at the gum line, on tongue surface and within crevices, and the like). Besides being unsightly, plaque is implicated in the occurrence of gingivitis and other forms of periodontal disease.<br>
[0003] Bacteria thrive on the tongue. For the most part, the bacteria are a part of a protective bio-film that essentially renders them resistant to most treatments. Few people clean their tongue after brushing, even though it's been shown that as much as 50 percent of the mouth's bacteria can be found here. Additionally, for many people, brushing or scraping the tongue is difficult because of the gag reflex. Therefore, cleaning the tongue non-mechanically is highly desirable for those who are unable to do so with a mechanical device.<br>
[0004] A wide variety of agents have been suggested in the art to retard plaque formation and the oral infections and dental disease associated with plaque formation. In spite of the extensive amount of products related to antibacterial dentifrice and related oral treatment compositions, there is still a need for a product with enhanced bacteria anti-attachment properties.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0005] A composite comprising a silicone compound sorbed onto a porous cross-linked polymer.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0006] As used throughout, ranges are used as a shorthand for describing each and every value that is within the range. Any value within the range can be selected as the terminus of the range. [0007] The present invention provides oral care compositions and methods for administration or application to, or use with, a human or other animal subject. The oral care compositions deliver silicone compounds, such as silicon adhesives and silicone fluid, to surfaces of an oral cavity. In various embodiments, the compositions provide bacterial anti-attachment, or anti-adhesion properties.<br>
[0008] As referred to herein, an "oral care composition" is any composition that is suitable for administration or application to the oral cavity a human or animal subject for enhancing the health, hygiene or appearance of the subject, in certain embodiments providing such benefits as the prevention or treatment of a physiologic condition or disorder, the provision of sensory, decorative or cosmetic benefits, and combinations thereof.<br>
[0009] The present invention encompasses oral care compositions containing an anti-adhesion/anti-attachment agent. Embodiments include providing a delivery system or composition for inhibiting bacterial adhesion on an oral surface using an anti-attachment agent releasing oral care composition. In various embodiments, the compositions comprise a silicone composite having a silicone compound and a porous cross-linked polymer mixed in an orally acceptable carrier.<br>
[0010] In various embodiments, the present invention provides compositions comprising a silicone composite having one or more silicone compounds. In certain embodiments, the silicone composite is present in the oral care composition at a concentration of about 0.5% to about 99%, optionally in various embodiments at an amount of about 1% to about 50%, about 5% to about 30%, about 7% to about 20%, or about 8% to about 15%. The silicone composite may contain, for example, a silicone adhesive and a silicone fluid, as discussed in more detail below.<br>
[0011] Silicone compounds useful for inclusion in the silicone composite contain, but are not limited to, silicone polymers, silicone adhesives, silicone gums, silicone waxes, silicone elastomers, silicone fluids, silicone resins, silicone powders, and mixtures thereof. If the composite comprises a silicone adhesive and a silicone fluid, the adhesive may be present in an amount of about 0.01% to about 99% by weight, about 1% to about 50%, about 5% to about<br><br>
30%, about 7% to about 20%, or about 8% to about 15% by weight of the total composition. The fluid may be present in an amount (by weight of the total composition) of about 0.01% to about 99%, 0.1% to about 1% or about 0.5% to about 0.7%.<br>
[0012] In one embodiment, the silicone compound of the composite comprises an amine compatible silicone adhesive, or a pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) composition, including those that are well known in the art. Generally, silicone based PSA's are produced by condensing a silicone resin and an organosiloxane such as a polydiorganosiloxane. Suitable silicone polymers include the copolymer product of mixing a silanol terminated polydiorganosiloxane such as polydimethyl siloxane with a silanol-containing silicone resin whereby the silanol groups of the polydiorganosiloxane undergo a condensation reaction with the silanol groups of the silicone resin so that the polydiorganosiloxane is lightly crosslinked by the silicone resin (that is, the polydiorganosiloxane chains are bonded together through the resin molecules to give chain branching and entanglement and/or a small amount of network character) to form the silicone pressure sensitive adhesive. A catalyst, for example an alkaline material such as ammonia, ammonium hydroxide or ammonium carbonate, can be mixed with the silanol-terminated polydiorganosiloxane and the silicone resin to promote this crosslinking reaction. By copolymerizing the silicone resin with the silanol terminated polydiorganosiloxane, the self adhering property and the cohesive properties of a soft elastomer matrix. Modifying the silicone resin to polydiorganosiloxane ratio of the pressure sensitive adhesive will modify the tackiness of the oral care composition. For example, PSAs are available from the Dow-Corning Corporation under the brand name BIO-PSA™.<br>
[0013] Silicone gums useful herein include high molecular weight polydiorganosiloxanes having a viscosity, at 25°C, of about 500,000 cS up to about 50,000,000 cS. Such silicone gums include those polydiorganosiloxanes with a weight average molecular weight of greater than 500,000. The polysiloxane gums for use herein can be linear or cyclic, and branched or unbranched. Substituents may have any structure as long as the resulting polysiloxanes are hydrophobic, are neither irritating, toxic nor otherwise harmful when applied to the oral cavity, and are compatible with the other components of the composition. Specific examples of siloxane gums include polydimethylsiloxane, methylvinylsiloxane, copolymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane, diphenyl, methyvinylsiloxane) copolymer and mixtures thereof. Silicone gums include those<br><br>
commercially available and marketed by General Electric. Silicone waxes include cosmetic waxes and silky waxes.<br>
[0014] Polysiloxane fluids useful herein include those with a viscosity, at 25° C, of about 1 cStk to about 1000 cS, or about 2 cS to about 500 cS, or about 20 cS to about 400 cS. Polysiloxane fluids for use herein can be linear or cyclic, and can be substituted with a wide variety of substituents (including as described above). In certain embodiments, substituents include methyl, ethyl and phenyl substituents. Suitable polysiloxane fluids include linear polysiloxane polymers such as dimethicone and other low viscosity analogues of the polysiloxane materials, in certain embodiments having a viscosity, at 25°C, of 200 cS or less and cyclomethicone, and other cyclic siloxanes having for example a viscosity, at 25° C, of 200 cS or less. Other fluids include polysiloxane polyether copolymers and hydroxy terminated polydimethyl-siloxane fluid (e.g., Dow Corning ST- DIMETHICONOL™ 40, Dow Corning SGM 36, SGM3). Commercial examples of materials that are suitable for use herein include DC200 series fluids marketed by Dow-Corning Corporation and the AK Fluid series marketed by Wacker-Chemie GmbH, Munchen, Germany. High molecular silicone resins with a polysiloxane blend may also be used including powdered trimethylsiloxysilicate, for example, Dow Corning 593 fluid, Wacker Belsil TMS 803.<br>
[0015] Suitable elastomeric silicone powders can be used having a particle size of about 1 to about 15 u.m, for example dimethicone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymers. Additionally, in certain embodiments, non-ionic emulsions containing 30% dimethicone can be used. [0016] The oral composition contain a porous cross-linked polymer. As referred to herein, a "porous cross-linked polymer" is a particulate polymer material which is operable to sorb a silicone compound. The term "sorb" refers to the "sorptive" (or "sorption") capability of the polymer particles to adsorb, absorb, complex, or otherwise retain a silicone compound. As used herein, "porous" refers to the presence of voids or interstices between cross-linked polymers that increases the overall surface area of the polymer beyond a solely perimeter measurement. Without limiting the mechanism, function or utility of present invention, it is understood in some embodiments that the composite comprises polymeric particulates having a non-smooth surface and an irregular polymeric matrix in which the silicone compound is retained. The chemical and physical characteristics of the particulate hinder the release of the silicone compound from the polymer particulates, and in some embodiments provides sustained release of the silicone<br><br>
compound. In various embodiments, the polymer comprises porous particulates having a BET pore volume (Brunauer, Emmett and Teller method) of about 0.05 to about 0.3 cc/g, optionally about 0.1 to about 0.2 cc/g, optionally about 0.14 to about 0.16 cc/g. In one embodiment, the silicone composite comprises a silicone compound at an amount of about 50% to about 95%, about 70% to about 95%, or about 70% to about 90% by weight of the silicone composite. [0017] In one embodiment, the cross-linked polymer is the polymerization product of at least one, and in other embodiments at least two, monomers having at least two unsaturated bonds (hereinafter referred to as "polyunsaturated" monomers), the monomers being polymerized including no more than about 40% by weight, and in other embodiments less than about 9% by weight, total monomer weight of monounsaturated co-monomers.

should not be calculated as part of the polyunsaturated monomer content, but as part of the<br>
monoethylenically unsaturated monomer content.<br>
[0026] In one embodiment, two polymerized polyunsaturated monomers are used. Allyl<br>
methacrylates polymerized with ethylene glycol dimethacrylate are particularly suitable for<br>
trapping a silicone compound to form the silicone composite. In such an embodiment, the<br>
diunsaturated monomers also function as cross-linking agents. This specific polymerization<br>
product is a polymeric porous sphere that appears as a powder.<br>
[0027] In one embodiment, the polymer particulates useful herein are made by a process<br>
comprising:<br>
a)	dissolving at least one, and in other embodiments at least two, polyunsaturated monomers, and in some embodiments along with an effective amount of an organic polymerization initiator, in a water-immiscible silicone fluid solvent, to provide a monomer mixture;<br>
b)	slowly agitating the dissolved monomers and silicone solvent;<br>
c)	continuing slow agitation during polymerization of the monomers in the silicone fluid to produce microporous polymer micro-particles and agglomerates thereof; and<br>
d)	separating the microporous polymer micro-particles and agglomerates from the silicone solvent to produce microporous, polymer micro-particles and aggregates in the form of spheres.<br>
[0028] In various embodiments, the sphere aggregates and sphere agglomerates having a diameter of less than about 500 microns, in other embodiments less than about 100 microns, or in other embodiments less than about 80 microns.<br>
[0029] Porous cross-linked polymers among those useful herein are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,955,552 and 6,387,995. Such polymers include those commercially available as: MICROSPONGE™ 5640, marketed by A.P. Pharma, Redwood City, California, U.S.A.; POLYTRAP™ 6603 and POLY-PORE™ 200 series, marketed by Amcol International Corp, Arlington Heights, Illinois, U.S.A.; and DSPCS-12 series and SPCAT-12 series, marketed by Kobo Products, Inc., South Plainfield, New Jersey, U.S.A. Each of the above-listed patents is incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
 [0030] The present invention provides compositions comprising an orally acceptable carrier or dentifrice vehicle. As used herein, an "orally acceptable carrier" refers to a material or combination of materials that are safe for use in the compositions of the present invention, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, with which the silicone composite may be associated while retaining significant efficacy. In certain embodiments, it is desired that the carrier not substantially reduce the efficacy of the silicone composite. Selection of specific carrier components is dependant on the desired product form, including dentifrices, rinses, gels, and paints. In various embodiments, the carrier is operable to sufficiently adhere the silicone composite against surfaces within the oral cavity to which the composition is administered, without concomitant use of a dental tray, mouthpiece, tape, or similar appliance. In various embodiments, the carrier is operable for use with a tape, tray, mouthpiece or similar appliance. Carriers may be either aqueous or non-aqueous phases. Aqueous phase carriers in certain embodiments contain a humectant therein. The humectant in certain embodiments is glycerin, sorbitol, xylitol, and/or propylene glycol having a weight average molecular weight of about 200 to about 1,000. The humectant concentration typically totals about 5% to about 70% of the oral composition. In various embodiments, the carrier is non-aqueous.<br>
[0031] Materials among those that are useful in carriers include adhesion agents, thickening agents, viscosity modifiers, diluents, surfactants, foam modulators, humectants, pH modifying agents, mouth feel agents, flavorants, sweeteners, and other optional ingredients such as whitening agents, abrasives, anticaries agents, etc. as will be discussed below. It is understood that while general attributes of each of the above categories of materials may differ, there may be some common attributes and any given material may serve multiple purposes within two or more of such categories of materials. Generally, such carrier materials are selected for compatibility with the silicone composite and with other ingredients of the composition. [0032] In various embodiments, the carrier comprises an adhesion agent.

(Formula Removed)<br>
[0065] Comparative Example 1 depicts a typical dentifrice composition without the use of a cross-linked polymer. Examples 2-4 contain a silicone composite created with POLY-PORE™. Example 4 is a non-aqueous composition. The dentifrice compositions are made by a process generally as follows. The CMC and TSPP are dispersed in glycerin, followed by the addition of a CHITOGLYCAN™ solution. Sodium MFP and sodium saccharin are dissolved in water and added to the solution. A silicone adhesive is diluted to 50% of its concentration using dimethicone. A silicone adhesive POLY-PORE™ complex is made by mixing 23% POLY-PORE   with the diluted sil icone adhesive. Dicalcium phosphate is added and uniformly dispersed. The silicone adhesive/ POLY-PORE™ complex is added to the solution and homogeneously dispersed, followed by the addition of flavor and sodium lauryl sulfate. Examples 2-4 exhibit greater than a 60% reduction in the bacterial attachment as compared to Example 1.
