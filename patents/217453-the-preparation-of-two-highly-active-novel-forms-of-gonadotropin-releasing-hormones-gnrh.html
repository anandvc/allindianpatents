				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the preparation of<br>
two highly active novel forms of gonadotropin releasing<br>
hormones (GnRH)<br>
This invention further relates to two novel highly<br>
active forms of GnRH.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
It is well known that brain gonadotropin releasing<br>
hormone (GnRH) plays a vital role in the reproduction<br>
of fish as in other vertebrates including mammals. GnRH<br>
is a decapeptide and is secreted from the hypothalamus.<br>
This neuropeptide binds to pituitary gonadotropin cell<br>
receptor and causes gonadotropin (GtH) release from the<br>
pituitary gland, GtH in turn acts on the gonad (testis<br>
and ovary), induces maturation of germ cells ultimately<br>
leading to spermiation and ovulation via the synthesis<br>
and secretion of gonadal sex stroids. In these events<br>
of reproduction, GnRH is the primary regulator, therefore<br>
the control of reproduction in different animals by using<br>
GnRH has been the practice of the day. Peptide structures<br>
of two forms of fish GnRH have so far been discovered,<br>
salmon GnRH and dogfish GnRH. Both contain 10 amino acids,<br>
amino terminal has a pyroglutamate residue, while carboxy<br>
terminal has an amidated glycine, only at 5 position there<br>
is a variation. A structural elucidation of mammalian<br>
GnRH and other two brain peptides are known in the art.<br>
Considerable research has been effected with mammalian<br>
GnRH including the development of antibody and<br>
GnRH-receptor gene expression. Sherwood et. al. in 1983<br>
first discovered the structure of salmon GnRH. They<br>
purified salmon GnRH by using mammalian GnRH antibody.<br>
Hence, purification of salmon GnRH was based on<br>
immunological detection. Salmon GnRH did show biological<br>
activity in other fishes. A number of chemical analogs<br>
of mammalian and salmon GnRH have been prepared aiming<br>
mainly to (1) stabilizing the molecule against enzymatic<br>
degradation (2) increasing its binding to circulating<br>
proteins (3) enhancing the affinity of the molecules for<br>
receptors (Millar et. al., 1997). Salmon GnRH analog has<br>
been commercialized and available as Ovaprim. This also<br>
contains a dopamine agonist ie. Pimozide. Ovaprim is the<br>
only product available in the market for the induced<br>
breeding of fish. GnRHs from mammalian or piscine sources<br>
have been isolated or purified by detecting the molecule<br>
with immunological cross-reaction. There always remains<br>
a problem when a molecule is isolated by using a<br>
heterologous antibody. The molecule may be immunologically<br>
well recognised but biological activity of the same will<br>
be questionable. Since it is easy to isolate GnRH by<br>
immunological detection, everyone followed this method<br>
to purify GnRH. The need to purify murrel hypothalamic<br>
GnRH by developing a highly sensitive and consistent assay<br>
of GnRH biological activity remained.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this inventin is to propose the<br>
preparation of two highly active notvel forms of<br>
gonadotropin releasing hormones.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to develop<br>
a sensitive and dependable assay of GnRH, to obtain<br>
biological GnRH.<br>
Further objects and advantages of the invention<br>
will be more appararent from the ensuing.<br>
At the outset of the description which follows,<br>
it is to be understood that the ensuing description<br>
illustrates a particular form of this invention. However,<br>
such a particular form is only an exemplary embodiment,<br>
without intending to imply any limitation on the scope<br>
of the invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided<br>
a method for the preparation of two highly active novel<br>
forms of gonadotropin releasing hormones (GnRH) comprising<br>
the steps of extracting the hypothalami of Indian<br>
teleostean fish such as murrel or carp, subjecting the<br>
same to the step of acetone fractionation, identifying<br>
the active fraction as the Acetone II fraction by<br>
radioimmunoassary, followed by gel filtration of the<br>
Acetone II fraction, eluting the fraction through anionic<br>
Mono Q and cationic Mono S columns, leading to GnRH I,<br>
GnRH II, followed by purification of each form through<br>
reverse phase chromatography to obtain pure forms of GnRH<br>
I and GnRH II.<br>
In accordance with this invention a sensitive<br>
and dependable assay of GnRH has been developed. The murrel<br>
pituitary gonadotropin is first purified and the antibody<br>
against it is raised which permits the development of<br>
a dependable, quick and sensitive RIA of murrel GtH. This<br>
is followed by the development of a murrel pituitary<br>
primary static cell culture system. In this pituitary<br>
cell culture system, test material during the purification<br>
steps is added and the amount of gonadotropin released<br>
into the medium is determined by GtH RIA. Hence, this<br>
GnRH biological activity assay is extremely dependable<br>
and will allow the isolation of a molecule which definitely<br>
contains cellular release of GtH property. Murrel GnRH<br>
I&amp;II were isolated by this procedure and therefore their<br>
biological activity in laboratory cell culture system<br>
or in the field for induced breeding is unquestionable.<br>
The establishment of this biological assay, has made the<br>
isolation of mGnRH I possible which is an anionic GnRH<br>
and no anionic GnRH has yet been isolated from other<br>
sources. Murrel GnRH I does not give any cross reaction<br>
with anti-salmon GnRH antibody or anti-mammalian GnRH<br>
antibody.<br>
In accordance with this invention there is further<br>
provided two distinct distinct bioactive forms of GnRH<br>
from murrel brain. GnRH so far isolated from different<br>
vertebrates" brain has net cationic charge. Therefore<br>
in attempts to isolate GnRH, a cation exchanger column<br>
has always been used. The applicants tried to separate<br>
gel filtered Sephadex G-25 Peak II (using AC FII fraction<br>
in this chromatography), which has high GnRH activity,<br>
through a Mono Q column for Fast Performance Liquid<br>
Chromatography Mono Q is an anion exchanger. Very<br>
surprisingly an adsorbed material which is also a<br>
decapeptide and exhibits strong GnRH activity has been<br>
obtained. This is an unusual GnRH as it is adsorbed in<br>
an anionic exchanger column. Later, when Mono S (cationic<br>
exchanger) was available, the lyophilized material of<br>
Mono Q elute (unbound washed material through Mono Q)<br>
has been used and the second GnRH ie. cationic GnRH as<br>
the adsorbed material has been found). Since the Mono<br>
Q anionic GnRH was obtained earlier, it has been named<br>
murrel GnRH I and Mono S cataionic GnRH as GnRH II. Hence,<br>
although the discovery of an anionic form of GnRH was<br>
made possible with the above mentioned background, it<br>
is a considerable contribution in process technology as<br>
to one would use this particular step of separation and<br>
obtain an unique from of GnRH.<br>
The assay according to the invention is undertaken<br>
as follows:<br>
Pituitary cells from the murrel or carp are<br>
enzymatically dispersed (0.3% collagenase and 0.05%<br>
trypsin), washed and added into the NUNC microwell module<br>
(each has capacity of 400 ul volume) for short culture.<br>
4<br>
Each well contains 6x10 cells. Viability of cells is<br>
examined by trypan blue dye exclusion method. Test material<br>
containing GnRH activity is added to the pituitary cells<br>
and release of gonadotropic hormone (GtH) into the medium<br>
is estimated by GtH radioimmuno assay by raising anti-<br>
GtH antibody against murrel pituitary GtH.<br>
Based on this assay, murrel and carp GnRH have<br>
been purified. Purification steps are briefly described<br>
below. Murrel or carp hypothalami are extracted with 1N<br>
acetic acid, filtered through cheese cloth and subjected<br>
to acetone fractionation to obtain three different pellets,<br>
ACI, ACII and ACIII and only ACII exhibits GnRH activity<br>
ie. it releases substantial amount of GtH into the medium<br>
while ACI or ACIII does not show such activity. ACII<br>
fraction is then subjected to Sephadex G-25 gel filtration.<br>
A concurrent run of synthetic mammalian GnRH is given<br>
to identify the zone of decapeptide elution. Gel filtration<br>
also gives three different peaks, SG I, SGII and SGIII.<br>
It is SGII peak which clearly corresponds to the elution<br>
peak of synthetic mammalian GnRH indicating the zone of<br>
decapeptide elution and it is also SGII fraction which<br>
demonstrates GnRH activity. Pooled SGII fractions are<br>
lyophilized to reduce the volume and then subjected to<br>
FPLC Mono Q (anion exchanger) column chromatography.<br>
Adsorbed material is eluted by a continuous gradient of<br>
NaC1 . There is one unadsorbed peak (MQ I) and three<br>
adsorbed protein peaks (MQ II, MQ III and MQ IV). MQ II<br>
remarkably increases GtH release as compared to control<br>
while MQ III or MQ IV has no such activity. Surprisingly,<br>
Mono Q unadsorbed protein peak MQ I also indicates GnRH<br>
activity. Hence, this unadsorbed protein fractions are<br>
pooled lyophilized and passed through FPLC Mono S (cation<br>
exchanger) where it again shows one unadsorbed (MS I)<br>
and three adsorbed (SS III and MS IV) protein peaks and<br>
among these only MS II shows a highly significant GnRH<br>
activity. Hence, two forms of GnRH have been obtained,<br>
an anionic form ie. GnRH I (Mono Q) and a cationic form<br>
ie. GnRH II (Mono S). This is indeed very surprising as<br>
two almost equally potent bioactive forms of GnRHs has<br>
not yet been reported from any class of vertebrates. Both<br>
GnRH I and GnRH II have been further purified by reverse<br>
phase column chromatography (FPLC Pep-RPC) murrel GnRHs<br>
have been found to be more active even in carp, murrel<br>
GnRHs (I and II) have been used in field studies.<br>
During the process of purification, certain<br>
innovative steps have been adopted which very surprisingly<br>
led to two distinct forms of GnRHs (GnRH I and GnRH II)<br>
from the brain of murrel. Both are highly active and<br>
individually more than doubly active as compared to salmon<br>
GnRH or its analogues examined so far in different Indian<br>
fish pituitary cell culture system. These GnRH have been<br>
found to be remarkably more active than carp GnRHs. In<br>
field experiments for the induced breeding of Indian carps,<br>
biopotency of murrel GnRH I or GnRH II astonishingly<br>
exceeds the potency of salmon GnRH. This is the first<br>
time when two highly biologically active GnRH molecules<br>
are available from the brain of the same fish. Till date,<br>
although more than one immunoreactive forms have been<br>
identified in fish brain but isolation of more than one<br>
biologically active forms has not been reported.<br>
By using fractionation steps of acetic acid<br>
extracted from the brain of Indian freshwater murrel,<br>
a major amount of the extraneous materials could be<br>
removed. This is such an effective step, that, if followed<br>
rigorously, acetone fractionated material of murrel GnRH<br>
(50 ug/Kg fish) provides 100% success in induced breeding<br>
of carps. Although this is a very simple and very<br>
inexpensive process to isolate active GnRH material,<br>
definitely highly effective procedure to obtain<br>
biologically active GnRH.<br>
The murrel GnRH I&amp;II isolated by the process<br>
of our invention have been found to be three times more<br>
active than the commercially available Ovaprim. Another<br>
interesting feature is the summation effect of murrel<br>
GnRH I&amp;II since they occupy two distinct receptors,<br>
specific for each type of GnRH in the pituitary cell<br>
membrane. By adding calcium and pimozide with murrel GnRH<br>
I and plus II, field trials for induced pimozide with<br>
murrel GnRH I plus II, field trials for induced breeding<br>
of different carps was undertaken. Ovaprim was also used<br>
concurrently to compare the effect. Our material (combined<br>
GnRH I plus II) was far more active as compaed to Ovaprim<br>
both in terms of dose and also in terms of reductin of<br>
spawning time. Ovaprim is an imported material and is<br>
the only product in the global market for induced breeding<br>
of fish. Since murrel GnRH I&amp;II are much more active than<br>
Ovaprim it would be a highly competitive product in the<br>
international market.<br>
