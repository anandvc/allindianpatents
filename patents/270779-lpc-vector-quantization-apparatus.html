				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
LPC VECTOR QUANTIZATION APPARATUS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an LPC vector<br>
quantization apparatus applicable to a speech<br>
coder/decoder used to enhance transmission efficiency<br>
of a speech signal in the fields of a packet communication<br>
system represented by Internet communication and mobile<br>
communication system/ etc.<br>
Background Art<br>
When a speech signal is transmitted in a packet<br>
communication system represented by Internet<br>
communication or mobile communication system, a<br>
compression/coding technology is often used to enhance<br>
transmission efficiency of the speech signal.  Many<br>
speech coding systems have been developed so far, and<br>
many lowbit rate speech coding systems developed in recent<br>
years separate a speech signal into a spectral envelope<br>
information and a sound source information and<br>
compress/code the separated information pieces.  For<br>
example, a CELP system described in Document 1<br>
(M.R.Schroeder, B.S.Atal, "Code Excited Linear<br>
Prediction: High Quality Speech at Low Bit Rate", IEEE<br>
proc, ICASSP'85 pp. 937-940) is one of its examples.<br>
Here, an overview of a CELP-based speech coder will<br><br>
be explained using FIG. 1. Suppose an input speech signal<br>
is input to a speech coder successively every processing<br>
frame delimited by a time interval of approximately 20<br>
ma.<br>
The input speech signal input to the speech coder<br>
for every processing frame is supplied to an LPC analysis<br>
section 11 first. The LPC analysis section 11 carries<br>
out an LPC (Linear Predictive Coding) analysis on the<br>
input speech signal, obtains an LPC vector having LPC<br>
coefficients as vector components, vector-quantizes the<br>
LPC vector obtained to obtain an LPC code, and decodes<br>
this LPC code to obtain a decoded LPC vector having decoded<br>
LPC coefficients as vector components.<br>
An excitation vector generation section 14 reads<br>
an adaptive codevector and fixed codevector from an<br>
adaptive codebook 12 and a fixed codebook 13 respectively<br>
and sends those codevectors to an LPC synthesis filter<br>
15.  The LPC synthesis filter 15 performs synthesis<br>
filtering on the adaptive codevector and the fixed<br>
codevector supplied from the excitation vector generation<br>
section 14 using an all-pole model synthesis filter having<br>
the decoded LPC coefficients given from the LPC analysis<br>
section 11 as filter coefficients and obtains a<br>
synthesized adaptive codevector and a synthesized fixed<br>
codevector, respectively.<br>
A comparison section 16 analyzes a relationship<br>
between the synthesized adaptive codevector, the<br>
synthesized fixed codevector output from the LPC<br><br>
synthesis filter 15 and the input speech signal, and<br>
calculates an adaptive codebook optimum gain to be<br>
multiplied on the synthesized adaptive codevector and<br>
a fixed codebook optimum gain to be multiplied on the<br>
synthesized fixed codevector, respectively.<br>
Furthermore/ the comparison section 16 adds up the vector<br>
obtained by multiplying the synthesized adaptive<br>
codevector by the adaptive codebook optimum gain and the<br>
vector obtained by multiplying the synthesized fixed<br>
codevector by the fixed codebook optimum gain to obtain<br>
a synthesized speech vector and calculates a distortion<br>
between the synthesized speech vector obtained and input<br>
speech signal.<br>
The comparison section 16 further calculates<br>
distortions between many synthesized speech vectors<br>
obtained by operating the excitation vector generation<br>
section 14 and LPC synthesis filter 15 on all possible<br>
combinations of adaptive codevectors stored in the<br>
adaptive codebook 12 and fixed codevectors stored in the<br>
fixed codebook 13, and the input speech signal, determines<br>
an index of an adaptive codevector and an index of a fixed<br>
codevector that minimize the distortions from among those<br>
codevectors and sends the indices of the codevectors<br>
output from the respective codebooks, codevectors<br>
corresponding to the indices and an adaptive codebook<br>
optimum gain and fixed codebook optimum gain<br>
corresponding to the indices to a parameter coding section<br>
17.<br><br>
The parameter coding section 17 codes the adaptive<br>
codebook optimum gain and fixed codebook optimum gain<br>
to obtain gain codes, and outputs the gain codes obtained/<br>
the LPC code given from the LPC analysis section 11 and<br>
the indices of the respective codebooks together for each<br>
processing frame.<br>
The parameter coding section 17 further adds up two<br>
vectors; a vector obtained by multiplying the adaptive<br>
codevector corresponding to the index of the adaptive<br>
codebook by an adaptive codebook gain corresponding to<br>
the gain code and a vector obtained by multiplying the<br>
fixed codevector corresponding to the index of the fixed<br>
codebook by a fixed codebook gain corresponding to the<br>
gain code, thereby obtains an excitation vector and<br>
updates the old adaptive codevector in the adaptive<br>
codebook 12 with the excitation vector obtained.<br>
For synthesis filtering by the LPC synthesis filter<br>
15, it is a general practice that linear predictive<br>
coefficients, high-pass filter and perceptual weighting<br>
filter using a long-term predictive coefficient obtained<br>
by carrying out a long-term predictive analysis on the<br>
input speech are used together. It is also a general<br>
practice that a search for optimum indices of the adaptive<br>
codebook and fixed codebook, calculation of optimum gains<br>
and coding processing of optimum gains are carried out<br>
in units of a subframe obtained by subdividing a frame.<br>
Next, an overview of processing of "vector<br>
quantization of LPC vector" carried out by the LPC analysis<br><br>
section 11 will be explained in more detail using FIG.2.<br>
Suppose that an LPC codebook 22 stores a plural entries<br>
of typical LPC vectors acquired beforehand by applying<br>
the LBG algorithm to many LPC vectors obtained by actually<br>
carrying out an LPC analysis on input speech signals of<br>
many processing frames . With regard to the LBG algorithm/<br>
the details of its technology are disclosed in Document<br>
2 (Y. Linde, A. Buzo, R. M. Gray, "An Algorithm for Vector<br>
Quantizer Design," IEEE trans. Comm., Vol. COM-28, No.<br>
1, pp84-95, Jan., 1980).<br>
A quantization target vector input to the vector<br>
quantizer in FIG.2 (an LPC vector obtained by carrying<br>
out an LPC analysis on a speech signal in a processing<br>
frame section corresponds to the quantization target)<br>
is supplied to a distortion calculation section 21. Next,<br>
the distortion calculation section 21 calculates a<br>
Euclidean distortion between an LPC codevector stored<br>
in the LPC codebook 22 and the quantization target vector<br>
according to the following Expression (1):<br><br>
■■■ Expression (1)<br>
where in Expression (1) , XT is a quantization target vector,<br>
Cm is an mth (l^m^M) LPC codevector in the LPC codebook,<br>
i is a component number of a vector, N is the order of<br>
a vector (corresponds to an LPC analysis order) and dm<br>
is a Euclidean distortion between XT and Cn.<br>
The distortion calculation section 21 successively<br><br>
calculates Euclidean distortions between all LPC<br>
codevectors stored in the LPC codebook 22 and the<br>
quantization target vector, then successively outputs<br>
the calculation results (respective Euclidean<br>
distortions) to an LPC codebook search section 23.  The<br>
LPC codebook search section 23 compares the respective<br>
Euclidean distortions supplied from the distortion<br>
calculation section 21 and outputs an index of an LPC<br>
codevector that minimizes the Euclidean distortion as<br>
an LPC code (coded expressing spectral envelope<br>
information on the processing frame).<br>
On the other hand, it is possible to obtain decoded<br>
LPC coefficients (decode LPC coefficients) by reading<br>
out the LPC codevector corresponding to the index<br>
indicated by the LPC code from the LPC codebook. By the<br>
way, since the processing of generating decoded LPC<br>
coefficients, which are used for constituting an all-pole<br>
model LPC synthesis filter, from the LPC code is generally<br>
carried out by both the speech coder and speech decoder.<br>
In many speech coders/decoders developed in recent<br>
years, LPC vector is not quantized as it is, and it is<br>
a general practice that an LPC vector is converted to<br>
an LSF (Line Spectral Frequency) vector having LSF<br>
parameters as vector components or an LSP (Line Spectral<br>
Pairs) vector having LSP parameters as vector components,<br>
which are one-to-one mutually convertible frequency<br>
domain vectors, and then vector-quantized.  This is<br>
because vector-quantizing the LPC vector after converting<br><br>
it to a vector in the frequency domainrather than directly<br>
vector-quantizing the LPC vector in time domain has higher<br>
quantization efficiency and higher interpolation<br>
characteristic. By the way, features of the LSF (or LSP)<br>
vector and a method for mutual conversion with the LPC<br>
vector are disclosed in Document 3 (F.Itakura, "Line<br>
Spectrum Representation of Linear Predictive<br>
Coefficients of Speech Signals," J. Acoust. Soc. Amer.,<br>
vol57, p.S35, Apr.1975) or Document 4 (L. K. Paliwal and<br>
B. S. Atal, "Efficient Vector Quantization of LPC<br>
Parameter at 24 Bits/Frame," IEEE trans, on Speech and<br>
Audio Processing, vol. 1, pp. 3-14, Jan. 1993).<br>
For example, when the LSF vector is quantized,  an<br>
LSF vector LSFT[i] (i=l,-",N) in the frequency domain<br>
obtained by converting the LPC vector, is input to the<br>
vector quantizer as the quantization target vector. In<br>
this case LPC codebook stores candidate LSF codevectors<br>
LSFm [i] (i = l,-",N) each vector having LSF parameters as<br>
vector components, it is possible to vector-quantize the<br>
target LSF vector using the same procedure as that when<br>
the target LPC vector is vector-quantized. However, when<br>
LSF (or LSP) vector is quantized, the weighted Euclidean<br>
distortion dm in Expression (2) below instead of<br>
Expression (1) above is often used as a measure for an<br>
LPC codebook search.<br><br><br><br>
The weighted Euclidean distortion is disclosed in<br>
detail, for example, in Document 4 or Document 5 (A. Kataoka,<br>
T. Moriya and S. Hayashi, "An 8-kb/s Conjugate Structure<br>
CELP (CS-CELP) Speech Coder," IEEE trans. Speech and Audio<br>
Processing, vol. 4, No. 6, pp.401-411, Nov. 1996) or<br>
Document 6 (R. Hagen, E. Paksoy, and A. Gersho,<br>
"Voicing-Specific LPC Quantization for Variable-Rate<br>
Speech Coding," IEEE trans. Speech and Audio Processing,<br>
vol. 7, no. 5, pp.485-494, Sept., 1999).<br>
By the way, it is possible to obtain decoded LSF<br>
parameters (decode LSF parameters) by reading out the<br>
LSF codevector corresponding to the index indicated by<br>
the LPC code from the LPC codebook by using the same manner<br>
as that for obtaining decoded LPC coefficients from LPC<br>
codes, that is, reading out a decoded LPC codevector<br>
corresponding to an LPC code from a codebook.  In this<br>
case, however, the decoded LSF parameters read based on<br>
the LPC code are parameters in the frequency domain.Thus,<br>
additional processing for converting the decoded LSF<br>
parameters in the frequency domain to decoded LPC<br>
coefficients in the time domain for constructing an<br>
all-pole model LPC synthesis filter is required.<br>
With regard to a speech coder/decoder according to<br>
a CELP system, etc., LPC parameters representing<br>
short-time spectral envelope information of a speech<br>
signal (hereinafter LPC coefficients and parameters such<br>
as LSF which are mutually convertible with LPC<br><br>
coefficients will be generically referred to as WLPC<br>
parameters") are generally compressed/coded by a vector<br>
quantizer. However, when a vector quantizer in a simple<br>
configuration as shown in FIG.2 is applied as is,<br>
quantization distortion generated by each processing<br>
frame will increase, failing to obtain preferable<br>
synthesized speech. For this reason, a lot of researches<br>
such as "predictive vector quantization technology",<br>
"multistage vector quantization technology" and "split<br>
vector quantization technology" have been made so far<br>
for improving the vector quantizer peformance. In order<br>
to design a high performance vector quantizer, it is<br>
indispensable to use many of these technologies in<br>
combination.<br>
By the way, when a vector quantizer of LPC vector<br>
is newly designed (or improved), an evaluation measure<br>
to compare/evaluate the performance of the quantizer is<br>
required. When evaluating the performance, it is<br>
preferable to use an evaluation measure considering that<br>
the LPC parameters are originally the parameters to<br>
express short-time spectral envelope information of a<br>
speech signal.  Thus, CD (Cepstral Distortion) measure<br>
in Expression (3) below which evaluates distortion in<br>
the LPC cepstrum domain corresponding to an LPC spectrum<br>
model or SD (Spectral Distortion) measure in Expression<br>
(4) below which evaluates distortion in an FFT (Fast<br>
Fourier Transformation) spectral domain is often used<br>
as a performance evaluation measure:<br><br><br><br>
where in Expression (3), L is the number of data frames<br>
used for evaluation, 1 is a frame number, Nc is the order<br>
of an LPC cepstrum (when the LPC analysis order N is the<br>
10th order, Nc is often on the order of the 16th order),<br>
CEPt(1) [i] is a target LPC cepstrum obtained by converting<br>
a quantization target of the first processing frame and<br>
CEPq (1) [i] is LPC cepstrum obtained by converting decoded<br>
LPC vector of the first processing frame.  The<br>
technological details of the features of the LPC cepstrum<br>
and method of mutual conversion between LPC vector and<br>
LPC cepstrum are disclosed, for example, in Document 7<br>
(M R.Shroeder, "Direct (Nonrecursive) Relations Between<br>
Cepstrum and Predictor Coefficients, "IEEE trans, on vol.<br>
ASSP-29, No.2, pp.297-301, Apr.,1981.).<br><br>
••• Expression (4)<br>
where in Expression (4) , L is the number data frames used<br>
for evaluation , 1 is a frame number, K is the number<br>
of FFT points, SPtm(1) is an FFT power spectrum of a<br>
quantization target of the lth processing frame, SPqll&gt; (uj )<br>
is an FFT power spectrum of a decoded LPC vector of the<br>
1-th processing frame and a j=2 TC j/K.  The technological<br><br>
details of the features of SD are disclosed/ for example,<br>
in Document 4 above.<br>
Both CD in Expression (3) and SD in Expression (4)<br>
are obtained by adding up quantization distortion<br>
generated in each processing frame throughout the<br>
evaluation data and then averaging the addition result<br>
by the number of data frames in the evaluation data, which<br>
means that the smaller the CD or SD, the higher the<br>
performance of the vector quantizer.<br>
When an LPC vector is vector-quantized, a Euclidean<br>
distortion Expression (1) or weighted Euclidean<br>
distortion Expression (2) is used as a reference measure<br>
for a LPC codebook search.  On the other hand, the<br>
performance of the LPC vector quantizer is generally<br>
evaluated using CD described in Expression (3) or SD<br>
described in Expression (4) as a performance evaluation<br>
measure.  That is, in LPC vector quantizers developed so<br>
far, a reference measure used for LPC codebook search<br>
is different from a reference measure used for evaluating<br>
the vector quantizer performance.  For this reason, the<br>
LPC code selected by LPC codebook search is not always<br>
an index for minimizing CD or SD measure. This causes<br>
a problem in designing a high performance vector<br>
quantizer.<br>
As the simplest method for solving the problem above,<br>
it may be reasonable to convert candidate LPC vectors<br>
to mutually convertible LPC cepstrums(or FFT power<br>
spectrums) and store them in a codebook beforehand, then<br><br>
converting an target LPC vector input in every frame to<br>
a target LPC cepstrum (or a target FFT power spectrum)<br>
and selecting an LPC cepstrum codevector (or FFT power<br>
sp.ectrum codevector) using CD (or SD) as a distortion<br>
measure. However, the above solution method causes a<br>
drastic increase of the memory capacity for storing<br>
candidate codevectors. Moreover, when a vector<br>
quantizer is conceived which uses "predictive vector<br>
quantization technology" or "multistage vector<br>
quantization technology" frequently used in a low bit<br>
rate speech coding system, it is necessary to store vectors<br>
with no mutual convertibility with an LPC cepstrum (for<br>
example, predictive residual vector or quantization error<br>
vector) in a codebook beforehand, and therefore the above<br>
solution method cannot be employed.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
With reference now to the attached drawings,<br>
embodiments of the present invention will be explained<br>
below.<br>
(Embodiment 1)<br>
An LPC vector quantization apparatus according to<br>
the present invention will be explained using FIG.3.<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing a configuration of the<br>
LPC vector quantization apparatus according to Embodiment<br>
1 of the present invention.<br>
This vector quantization apparatus is provided with<br>
an LSF codebook 101 that stores LSF codevector entries,<br>
a distortion calculation section 102 that calculates<br>
distortions between LSF codevector entries in the LSF<br>
codebook 101 and a target LSF vector, an LPC code<br>
pre-selection section 103 that preliminarily selects a<br>
preset small number of LPC codes based on the distortions<br>
calculated by the distortion calculation section 102,<br>
LSF/LPC conversion sections 104 and 106 that convert LSF<br>
vector to LPC coefficients, LPC coefficient/LPC cepstrum<br>
conversion sections 105 and 107 that convert LPC<br>
coefficients to LPC cepstrum and an LPC code final search<br>
section 108 that finally selects an LPC code based on<br>
the results of distortion evaluation in the LPC cepstrum<br><br>
domain.<br>
Suppose the LSF codebook 101 of the vector<br>
quantization apparatus in the above-described<br>
configuration stores M candidate LSF codevector entries<br>
acquired beforehand by the LBG algorithm.  Furthermore,<br>
suppose the LPC vector quantization apparatus according<br>
to this embodiment carries out an LPC analysis on a speech<br>
signal in a processing frame section to obtain LPC<br>
coefficients, further converts the LPC coefficients<br>
obtained to an LSF vector and inputs the LSF vector obtained<br>
as a quantization target vector.  Hereafter, a<br>
quantization target vector may be expressed with symbol<br>
LSFT[i] (i=l,...,N), where N is an LPC analysis order.<br>
The quantization target LSF vector, LSFT[i]<br>
(i=l,...,N), input to the vector quantization apparatus<br>
is supplied to the distortion calculation section 102<br>
and LSF/LPC conversion section 106 first.  On the other<br>
hand, the LSF codebook 101 supplies an LSF codevector<br>
LSFm[i] (i = l,...,N) corresponding to the instruction<br>
information (index m is supplied as information) supplied<br>
from the LPC code pre-search section 103 to the<br>
distortion calculation section 102.<br>
The distortion calculation section 102 calculates<br>
a weighted Euclidean distortion between the quantization<br>
target vector, LSFT[i] (i = l,...,N), and an LSF codevector,<br>
LSFm[i] (i=l,...,N), according to the above-described<br>
Expression (2) and outputs the calculation result dm to<br>
the LPC code pre-selection section 103.  After receiving<br><br>
the distortion dm corresponding to index m, the LPC code<br>
pre-selection section 103 instructs the LSF codebook 101<br>
to output another LSF codevector corresponding to the<br>
next index (m+1).<br>
In the case LSF codebook 101 stores M candidate LSF<br>
codevectors/ the processing at the LPC code pre-selection<br>
section 103 is repeated M times until ^distortions between<br>
LSF quantization target vector and Mcandidate LSF vector<br>
are obtained, and the M distortions are output to the<br>
LPC code pre-selection section 103.  In this way, M<br>
distortions dm (m=l,...,M) are input to the LPC code<br>
pre-selection section 103 at the time of completion of<br>
the processing by the LPC code pre-selection section 103 .<br>
The LPC code pre-selection section 103 compares the<br>
values of the M weighted Euclidean distortions input/<br>
and selects 5 candidate indices with smallest weighted<br>
Euclidean distortion value (in this embodiment, suppose<br>
the number Sis preset) and records the selected Scandidate<br>
indices in Ncandtj] (j = l,...,S) (any one of indices 1 to<br>
Afis recorded in Ncand[j]).  Then, it instructs the LSF<br>
codebook 101 of the indices recorded inNcand[ j] (j=l,..., S)<br>
and receives the corresponding LSF codevectors<br>
LSFMCandm [iJ (i = l,...,N, j=l,...,S) from the LSFcodebook 101.<br>
Then, the S LSF codevectors received are output to the<br>
LSF/LPC conversion section 104.<br>
The LSF/LPC conversion section 104 converts the<br>
preliminarily selected S LSF codevectors LSFNcand[ji {i]<br>
(i=l,...,tf, j = l,...,S) supplied from the LPC code<br><br>
pre-slection section 103 to their respective LPC<br>
coefficients to obtain LPCNcand[j) [i] (i=l,...,N, j = l,...,S)<br>
and outputs the 5 sets of LPC coefficients obtained to<br>
the LPC coefficient/LPC cepstrum conversion section 105.<br>
The LPC coefficient/LPC cepstrum conversion section<br>
105	converts the 5 sets of LPC coefficients LPCNC.IKUJ] [1]<br>
(i=l,...,N, j=*l,...,S) supplied from the LSF/LPC conversion<br>
section 104 to their respective LPC cepstra,<br>
CEPNc&gt;nd[j] [i] (i=l/.../Nc, 3=1,..., S: Nc is the order of an<br>
LPC cepstrum, and outputs the 5 LPC cepstra obtained to<br>
the LPC code final search section 108.<br>
On the other hand, the LSF/LPC conversion section<br>
106	converts a quantization target LSFT[i] (i=l,...,N) to<br>
an LPC coefficients to obtain LPCT[i] (i=l,...,N) and<br>
outputs the LPC coefficients obtained to the LPC<br>
coefficient/LPC cepstrum conversion section 107.  The<br>
LPC coefficient/LPC cepstrum conversion section 107<br>
converts the LPC coefficients LPCT[i] (i=l,...,N) supplied<br>
from the LSF/LPC coefficients conversion section 106 to<br>
an LPC cepstrum to obtain CEPT[i] (i = l,...,Nc) and outputs<br>
the LPC cepstrum obtained to the LPC code final search<br>
section 108.<br>
Then, the LPC code final search section 108<br>
calculates distortions between 5 candidates LPC cepstra,<br>
CEPNcand[ j i [i] (i=l,.../Nc, j = l,...,S), supplied from the LPC<br>
coefficient/LPC cepstrum conversion section 105 and the<br>
target LPC cepstrum ,CEPT[i] (i=l,...,N, j = l,...,S), supplied<br>
from the LPC coefficient/LPC cepstrum conversion<br><br>
section 107 according to Expression (5) below and retains<br>
the respective calculation results in Dj (j = l,—,S).<br><br><br>
Then, the LPC code final search section 108 compares<br>
the values of Dj (j=l,...,S), specifies one index j that<br>
minimizes Dj (the specified j is expressed as J here)<br>
and outputs Ncand [j] corresponding to the specified J<br>
as the LPC code of the relevant processing frame (code<br>
to express spectral envelope information of a speech<br>
signal of the relevant processing frame).  By the way,<br>
it is obvious from the relationship between Expression<br>
(5) and Expression (3) that "J" selected using the<br>
minimization of Expression (5) above as a reference is<br>
identical to the LPC code {assumed to be WJ'") selected<br>
using the minimization of Expression (3) as a reference.<br>
By the way, to give generality to explanations, this<br>
embodiment assumes that the number of LSF codevectors<br>
stored in the LSF codebook 101 is M and the number of<br>
codevectors preliminarily selected by the LPC code<br>
pre-selection section 103 is S.  The above-described<br>
value M is determined by the number of bits allocated<br>
to the LPC parameter vector quantization apparatus.  For<br>
example, when 21 bits per frame are allocated to the vector<br>
quantization apparatus shown in FIG. 3, the valueMbecomes<br>
an extremely large number of 221.  Furthermore, the<br><br>
above-described value S can be freely set, but it is often<br>
set to 8, 16 or about 32 empirically or through an advance<br>
performance evaluation test.<br>
Then, the processing of generating decoded LPC<br>
coefficients (also referred to as "decoding processing<br>
of LPC parameter") from the LPC code (Ncand[J]) output<br>
from the vector quantization apparatus shown in FIG. 3<br>
will be explained using the LPC vector decoder shown in<br>
FIG.4.  However, the decoder shown in FIG.4 is provided<br>
with the same LSF codebook 201 as that in the vector<br>
quantization apparatus and a codevector reading section<br>
202 that reads an LSF codevector from the LSF codebook<br>
201.<br>
LPC code, Ncand[J], input to the LPC vector decoder<br>
shown in FIG.4 is supplied to the codevector reading<br>
section 202 first.  Then, the codevector reading section<br>
202 instructs the LSF codebook 201 to output an LSF<br>
codevector corresponding to the LPC code, Ncand [ J] .  Then,<br>
the LSF codebook 201 outputs LSFNcand[j] [i] (i=*l,...,N) to<br>
the codevector reading section 202.  The codevector<br>
r<br>
reading section 202 outputs the vector supplied from the<br>
LSF codebook 201 as decoded LSF vector.<br>
Since the decoded LSF vector output from the LPC<br>
vector decoder above is parameters in the LSF-domain,<br>
an additional processing for converting the decoded LSF<br>
vector in the LSF-domain to decoded LPC coefficients in<br>
the LPC-domain for constructing an all-pole model LPC<br>
synthesis filter is required.<br><br>
According to the above-described LPC vector<br>
quantization apparatus, when the target LSF vector which<br>
is a quantization target is vector-quantized, it is<br>
passible to preliminarily select the preset small number<br>
of LSF codevectors from all candidate LSF codevectors<br>
stored in the LSF codebook using a weighted Euclidean<br>
distortion as a measure and it is possible to fully select<br>
a final code from the small number of pre-selected<br>
candidate LSF codevectors based on the pre-selection<br>
result using the CD minimization as a measure.<br>
Therefore, using the vector quantization apparatus<br>
according to the above-described embodiment makes it<br>
possible to reduce the problem of the conventional<br>
technology (problem that a selected LPC code by the vector<br>
quantization apparatus often mismatches an index of the<br>
codevector that minimizes the CD) without drastically<br>
increasing the amount of ca-lculation required for an LPC<br>
codebook search and improve the performance of the LPC<br>
vector quantization apparatus.<br>
By the way, according to this embodiment, when the<br>
vector quantization apparatus of the present invention<br>
is compared with the vector quantization apparatus<br>
explained in the section of the prior art, the vector<br>
quantization apparatus of the present invention slightly<br>
increases the amount of calculation required for the<br>
search of LPC codebook..  The portion corresponding to<br>
the increase in the amount of calculation can be summarized<br>
as the following six points:<br><br>
(1)	Amount of calculation to convert quantization target<br>
to target LPC coefficients<br>
(2)	Amount of calculation to convert the target LPC vector<br>
in-(1) to a target LPC cepstrum<br><br>
(3)	Amount of calculation to convert preliminarily<br>
selected small number of LPC codevectors to the small<br>
number of LPC coefficients<br>
(4)	Amount of calculation to convert the small number<br>
of LPC vectors in (3) to the small number of LPC cepstra<br>
(5)	Amount of calculation to calculate distortions<br>
between the target LPC cepstrum in (2) and the small number<br>
of LPC cepstra in (4)<br>
(6)	Amount of calculation to compare distortions in (5)<br>
and specify an index of a codevector that minimizes<br>
distortion<br>
In this case, it is generally possible to control<br>
the increase of the above-described amount of calculation<br>
by the number of candidates of the codevectors<br>
preliminarily selected and left (this is because it is<br>
(3), (4), (5) and (6) that substantially dominate the<br>
amount of calculation in (1) to (6) and these are directly<br>
dependent on the number of candidates in the<br>
pre-selection). That is, according to the vector<br>
quantization apparatus of the present invention/ it is<br>
possible to freely adjust a tradeoff relationship between<br>
the increase in the amount of calculation required for<br>
an LPC codebook search and the improvement of performance<br>
by increasing/decreasing the number of preliminarily<br><br>
selected candidates set in the LPC code pre-selection<br>
section 103.  Thus, this embodiment makes it possible to<br>
improve the performance of the vector quantization<br>
apparatus considering the increase in the amount of<br>
calculation required for an LPC codebook search.<br>
Furthermore, this embodiment has described the case<br>
where the number of candidate LSF codevectors left by<br>
the LPC code pre-selection section is predetermined, but<br>
it is also possible to use other pre-selection methods<br>
such as setting a threshold for a weighted Euclidean<br>
distortion and leaving a candidate whose weighted<br>
Euclidean distortion is smaller than the set threshold<br>
as a candidate after the pre-selection, and the same<br>
effect/operation can also be obtained in this case, too.<br>
Furthermore, this embodiment has described the case<br>
where the LPC code pre-selection section carries out<br>
pre-selection of an LSF codevector using the weighted<br>
Euclidean distortion of Expression (2) above as a measure,<br>
but the present invention can also be implemented when<br>
a weighted Euclidean distortion which is different from<br>
above-described'Expression (2) such as Expression (8)<br>
and Expression (10) in the aforementioned Document 4 is<br>
used, and the same effect/operation can also be obtained<br>
in this case, too.<br>
By the way, with respect to the "weight" in a weighted<br>
Euclidean distortion, various calculation methods have<br>
been proposed so far (e.g., a method described in Document<br>
5 where weighting is calculated according to the distances<br><br>
between adjacent elements of an LSF parameters, a method<br>
described in Document 6 where weighting is calculated<br>
according to a power spectrum of a quantization target) ,<br>
but the present invention is applicable irrespective of<br>
the method of calculating "weight" and the same<br>
effect/operation can also be obtained in this case, too.<br>
Furthermore, this embodiment has described the case<br>
where the LPC vector input to the vector quantization<br>
apparatus is LSF, but the present invention is also<br>
applicable when other vector expressing short-time<br>
spectral envelope information of a speech signal such<br>
as LSP vector, PARCOR vector having a PARCOR parameters<br>
as vector components, LPC vectoris input to the vector<br>
quantization apparatus as a target vector and the same<br>
effect/operation can also be obtained in this case, too.<br>
However, in the case where LSP is input as a<br>
quantization target, for example, it is necessary to<br>
change the LSF/LPC conversion sections 104 and 106 to<br>
the LSP/LPC conversion sections and change the LSF<br>
codebook 101 to the LSP codebook.<br>
Furthermore, this embodiment has described the case<br>
where the LPC code final search section specifies a final<br>
LPC code using the CD measure, but if the LPC<br>
coefficient/LPC cepstrum conversion sections (105, 107)<br>
is replaced by an LPC coefficient/FFT power spectrum<br>
calculation section that has the function of calculating<br>
an FFT power spectrum from LPC coefficients and Expression<br>
(5) above as the calculation expression executed by the<br><br>
LPC code final search section 108 is replaced by the<br>
calculation expression inside the square root portion<br>
of Expression (4), SD (Spectral Distortion) can also be<br>
used as a measure to specify the final LPC code and the<br>
same effect/operation can also be obtained in this case,<br>
too.<br>
As explained above, it is understandable that the<br>
vector quantization apparatus according to this<br>
embodiment^ is preferably applicable to cases where<br>
short-time spectral envelope information of a speech<br>
signal is coded/decoded by a speech coder/decoder based<br>
on a CELP system or Vocoder system.<br>
(Embodiment 2)<br>
This embodiment will explain the configuration of<br>
a vector quantization apparatus, processing procedure<br>
and effect/operation thereof when the technology<br>
according to the present invention is applied to the LPC<br>
vector quantization apparatus using a predictive vector<br>
quantization technology, multistage vector quantization<br>
technology and split vector quantization technology<br>
together.<br>
The configuration of the vector quantization<br>
apparatus strongly depends on the bit rate of the entire<br>
speech coder/decoder and the number of bits allocated<br>
to the LPC vector quantization apparatus.  Here, for<br>
simplicity of explanation, a vector quantization<br>
apparatus with 21-bit bit information per processing<br><br>
frame of a time interval of 20 ms allocated will be<br>
explained as a specific example below.<br>
Furthermore/ more specifically, suppose the vector<br>
quantization apparatus used in this explanation uses a<br>
third-order MA (Moving Average) prediction technology<br>
and uses 4 sets of MA predictive coefficients per<br>
processing frame (2-bit information is required for MA<br>
predictive coefficients switching). Moreover, suppose<br>
the vector quantization apparatus used in the explanation<br>
uses a 2-stage vector quantization technology.<br>
Furthermore, suppose the vector quantization apparatus<br>
used in the explanation uses a split vector quantization<br>
technology at the second stage of the 2-stage vector<br>
quantization apparatus.  By the way, the first stage<br>
vector quantizer, the vector quantizer of the second stage<br>
lower frequency components and the vector quantizer of<br>
the second stage higher frequency components are assigned<br>
7 bits, 6 bits and 6 bits, respectively.<br>
FIG.5 is a block diagram showing a configuration<br>
of a vector quantization apparatus according to<br>
Embodiment 2 the present invention.  As shown in FIG.5,<br>
the vector quantization apparatus in a 2-stage split<br>
configuration using third-order MA prediction to which<br>
the technology according to the present invention is<br>
applied is provided with a weight calculation section<br>
(WC) 301, a predictive coefficient codebook (PCC) 302,<br>
an MA predictor (MP) 303, a predictive residual<br>
calculation section (PRC) 304, a first stage codebook<br><br>
(FSC) 305, a first stage distortion calculation section<br>
(FSDCS) 306, a first stage VQ pre-selection section<br>

(F6VRC) 308, a second stage lower frequency codebook<br>
(SSLFC) 309, a second stage lower frequency distortion<br>
calculation section (SSLFD) 310, a second stage higher<br>
frequency distortion calculation section (SSHFD) 311,<br>
a second stage higher frequency codebook (SSHFC) 312,<br>
a second stage lower frequency codebook search section<br>
(SSLFC) 313, a second stage higher frequency codebook<br>

decoding section (PRD) 315, a decoded LSF generation<br>
section (DLG) 316, LSF/LPC coefficient conversion<br>
sections (LSF/LPC) 317 and 319, LPC coefficient/LPC<br>
cepstrum conversion sections (LC/LC) 318 and 320 and an<br>
LPC code final search section (LCFS) 321.<br>
In the explanation of FIG.5, the processing after<br>
an LSF vector is input until a target vector of the first<br>
stage vector quantizer is obtained (processing<br>
corresponding to the weight calculation section 301,<br>
predictive coefficient codebook 302, MA predictor 303<br>
and predictive residual calculation section 304) will<br>
be explained in detail.<br>
LSF vector input to the vector quantization<br>
apparatus in FIG. 5 are supplied to the weight calculation<br>
section 301, predictive residual calculation section 304<br>
and LSF/LPC conversion section 319.  The weight<br>
calculation section 301 calculates a "weight" used to<br><br>
calculate a weighted Euclidean distortion based on the<br>
LSF vector and outputs this weight (s) to the first stage<br>
distortion calculation section 306, second stage lower<br>
frequency distortion calculation section 310 and second<br>
stage higher frequency distortion calculation section<br>
311.<br>
By the way, as the method for calculating "weight"<br>
by the weight calculation section 301, the method<br>
described in Document 5 for calculating "weight"<br>
according to a distance between adjacent elements of LSF<br>
parameters or the method described in Document 6 for<br>
calculating "weight" according to a power spectrum of<br>
LSF vector, etc., can be used.  This embodiment assumes<br>
that no special limit is set for calculation of "weight."<br>
The MA predictor 303 calculates predictive vectors<br>
using decoded predictive residual vectors corresponding<br>
to the past 3 frames stored in the decoding predictive<br>
residual storage section (DPRS) 322 and third-order MA<br>
predictive coefficients stored in the predictive<br>
coefficient codebook 302 and outputs the calculated<br>
predictive vector to the predictive residual calculation<br>
section 304.<br>
By the way, suppose that the above-described<br>
processing of calculating/outputting a predictive vector<br>
is carried out for each of the 4 sets of third-order MA<br>
predictive coefficients stored in the predictive<br>
coefficient codebook 302 .  Therefore, a total of four sets<br>
of predictive vectors are output from the MA predictor<br><br>
303.  Furthermore, the four sets of predictive<br>
coefficients stored in the MA predictor 303 are acquired<br>
beforehand by applying the generalized Lloyd algorithm<br>
disclosed in Document 8 (S. P. Lloyd, "Least Square<br>
Quantization in PCM," IEEE trans. Inform.  Theory IT-28,<br>
pp. 129-137, 1982), etc., to four sets of arbitrarily<br>
initialized MA predictive coefficients.  Hereafter, for<br>
simplicity of explanation, suppose the four sets of<br>
third-order MA predictive coefficients will be<br>
represented with symbols MA|c[j][i].<br>
In the above-described symbol notation, k ( = 1, •••, 4)<br>
corresponds to a set number of the third-order MA<br>
predictive coefficients, j(==0, "*,3) corresponds to a<br>
frame number (j=0 corresponds to the current processing<br>
frame, j = l corresponds to the processing frame one frame<br>
ahead of the current processing frame, j=2 corresponds<br>
to the processing frame 2 "frames ahead of the current<br>
processing frame, j=3 corresponds to the processing frame<br>
3 frames ahead of the current processing frame), i (=1,<br>
■••,N: N is an LPC analysis order) corresponds to a number<br>
of vector-componentof the predictive coefficients.<br>
The predictive residual calculation section 304<br>
differentiates average LSF parameters (AV[i], i=l, •■• ,N)<br>
stored in the average LSF storage section (ALS) 323 from<br>
the LSF parameters.  By the way, the aforementioned<br>
average LSF parameters (AV[i ], i = l,..., N) are parameters<br>
obtained beforehand in the stage prior to actual<br>
coding/decoding processing by averaging the entire sets<br><br>
of LSF parameters of a training speech signal, and stored<br>
in the average LSF storage section 323.  Then, the<br>
predictive residual calculation section 304<br>
differentiates the predictive vectors supplied from the<br>
MA predictor 303 from the vector obtained by the<br>
aforementioned difference, calculates a predictive<br>
residual vector and outputs the calculated predictive<br>
residual vector as a target vector of the first stage<br>
vector quantizer to the first stage distortion<br>
calculation section 306, first stage VQ residual<br>
calculation section 308 and decoded LSF generation<br>
section 316.<br>
By the way, the above-described processing of<br>
calculating/outputting the predictive residual vector<br>
is carried out for each of 4 sets of MA predictive<br>
coefficients.  Therefore, a total of four entries of<br>
target vectors of the first stage vector quantizer are<br>
output from the predictive residual calculation section<br>
304.<br>
The processing after the LSF parameter is input until<br>
the target vector of the first stage vector quantizer<br>
is obtained has been explained in detail so far. Next,<br>
the processing of the first stage vector quantizer of<br>
the 2-stage vector quantizer (processing corresponding<br>
to the first stage codebook 305, first stage distortion<br>
calculation section 306, first stage VQ pre-selection<br>
section 307 and first stage VQ residual calculation<br>
section 308) will be explained in detail.<br><br>
The first stage codebook 305 stores 128 entries of<br>
predictive residual codevectors.  By the way, 128 entries<br>
of predictive residual codevectors are acquired<br>
beforehandby carrying out a series of the above-described<br>
processes until a quantization target is calculated on<br>
. speech signals in many processing frames, obtaining many<br>
predictive residual vectors, applying an LBG algorithm<br>
to the many predictive residual vectors obtained,<br>
extracting 128 entries of typical samples of predictive<br>
residual vectors and further applying the generalized<br>
Lloyd algorithm disclosed in the aforementioned Document<br>
8, etc.<br>
The first stage distortion calculation section 306<br>
calculates a weighted Euclidean distortion between the<br>
target vector (Xk [i],i=l,-,N) of the first stage vector<br>
quantizer supplied from the predictive residual<br>
calculation section 304 and the vector<br>
(MAk[0] [i]*Cm[iJ ,i = l,...,N) obtained by multiplying the<br>
predictive residual codevector (Cm[i], i = l, ...,N) with<br>
index m read from the first stage codebook 305 by the<br>
current processing frame component of the MA predictive<br>
coefficient (MAk [0] [i], i=l,..., N) according to Expression<br>
(6) below and outputs the calculated distortion value<br>
to the first stage VQ pre-selection section 307.<br><br>
••• Expression (6)<br>
where, in Expression (6), w[i] is "weight" calculated<br><br>
by the weight calculation section 301, k is a set number<br>
(k=l, •••, 4) of theMApredictive coefficients, mis an index<br>
(m-1, .••,128) of the predictive residual codevector in the<br>
first stage codebook.<br>
The above-described weighted Euclidean distortion<br>
is calculated by the first stage distortion calculation<br>
section 306 on 512 ( = 128x4) combinations of 128 entries<br>
(m=l,—,128) of predictive residual codevectors<br>
(CB[i], i=l,...,N) stored in the first stage codebook 305<br>
and 4 sets (k=l,"*,4) of MA predictive coefficients used<br>
to generate target vectors (Xk [i], i=l, ...,N) supplied from<br>
the predictive residual calculation section 304.<br>
Therefore, a total of 512 distortions dic,m (k=l,._, 4, m=l,<br>
•••,128) are output from the first stage distortion<br>
calculation section 306 to the first stage VQ<br>
pre-selection section 307.<br>
The first stage VQ pre-selection section 307<br>
compares above-described 512 distortions dk/m (k»l,.~, 4,<br>
m=l, ••-, 128) supplied from the first stage distortion<br>
calculation section 306, selects Nl types of combination<br>

coefficient set of the 4 sets of third-order MA predictive<br>
coefficients corresponds)and m (to which codevector of<br>
the 128 entries of codevectors in the first stage codebook<br>
305 corresponds), and records the selected k and m into<br>
Nlcand_k[j] and Nlcand_m[j] respectively, and outputs<br>
the recorded Nlcand_k[jJ and Nlcand_m[j] (j=l,...,Nl) to<br>
the first stage VQ residual calculation section 308,<br><br>

first stage VQ pre-selection section 307 and the<br>
codevector (read from the first stage codebook 305) in<br>
the first stage codebook/ the first stage VQ residual<br>
calculation section 308 calculates Nl first stage VQ<br>
residual vectors Xj121 [i] (i=l,...,N, j = l,...,Nl) which remain<br>
after the pre-selection processing according to<br>
Expression (7) below and outputs the calculated Nl vectors<br>
to the second stage lower frequency distortion<br>
calculation section 310 and second stage  higher<br>
frequency distortion calculation section 311.<br><br>
•■• Expression (7)<br>
By the way, the second stage vector quantizer of<br>
this embodiment adopts a split configuration, decomposing<br>
(splitting) the first stage VQ residual vector into lower<br>
frequency components (i=l,..., NL) and higher frequency<br>
components (i=NL+l,..., N) and vector-quantizing the<br>
respective vectors obtained by splitting separately.<br>
Therefore, X3 (2) [i] (i=l,...,N, j = l,...,Nl) calculated<br>
by the first stage VQ residual vector calculation section<br>
308 is output to the second stage  lower frequency<br><br>
distortion calculation section 310 and second stage<br>
higher frequency distortion calculation section 311 in<br>
accordance with the configuration of the second stage<br>
vector quantizer. More specifically, X}'2'[i] (i"l, ...,NL,<br>
j=l,...,Nl) is output to the second stage lower frequency<br>
distortion calculation section 310 and Xj(ZI[i]<br>
(i=NL+l,...,N, j=l/.../Nl) is output to the second stage<br>
higher frequency distortion calculation section 311.<br>
The processing of the first stage vector quantizer<br>
of the 2-stage vector quantizer has been explained in<br>
detail so far.  Next, the processing of the second stage<br>
vector quantizer of the second stage vector quantizer<br>
(processing corresponding to the second stage lower<br>
frequency codebook 309, second stage lower frequency<br>
distortion calculation section 310, second stage higher<br>

stage higher frequency codebook 312, second stage lower<br>
frequency codebook search section 313 and second stage<br>

explained in detail.<br>
The second stage lower frequency codebook 309 stores<br>
64 entries of second stage lower frequency codevectors<br>
(C2Lm21.fi], i=l,...,NL, m2L=l, — , 64) .  By the way, the<br>
aforementioned 64 entries of codevectors are acquired<br>
beforehand by carrying out processing until the last<br>
processing of the first stage vector quantizer which<br>
calculates the first stage VQ residual vectors on speech<br>
signals in many processing frames, obtaining many lower<br><br>

By the way, suppose that the second stage lower<br>

according to Expression (11) below and then compares the<br>
sizes of DISj (j = l,...,Nl) and specifies one index "J" that<br>
minimizes the distortion.<br><br>
••• Expression (11)<br>
By the way, it is obvious from the relationship<br>
between Expression (11) and Expression (3) that the same<br>
index is selected when the minimization of Expression<br>
(11) above is used as a reference measure to specify the<br>
index and when the minimization of CD in Expression (3)<br>
is used as a reference measure to specify the index.<br>
Then, 21-bit information combining the following<br>
four information items corresponding to the specified<br>
index "J", that is:<br>
(1)	Nlcand_k[j]: Which of 4 sets of MA predictive<br>

frequency codevectors is optimal (using 6 bits)<br>
is output as an LPC code of the relevant processing frame<br>
(code to express spectral envelope information on the<br>
processing frame section).<br>
The LPC codebook search supplies the index J that<br><br>
minimizes DISj to the predictive residual decoding<br>
section 315.  Then, the predictive residual decoding<br>
section 315 selects vector Cqjti] (i=l,...,N) corresponding<br>
to'the index J from among Nl (j = l,...,Nl) retained/stored<br>
decoded predictive residual vectors Cq3 [i] (i«l,_,N) and<br>
outputs them to the decoding predictive residual storage<br>
section 322.<br>
The decoding predictive residual storage section<br>
.322 discards the oldest decoded predictive residual<br>
vector of the decoded predictive residual vectors<br>
corresponding to a plurality of past frames stored (since<br>
this embodiment carries out third-order MA prediction,<br>
the decoded predictive residual vectors corresponding<br>
to the past 3 frames are stored) and newly retains Cqj[i]<br>
(i=l,...,N) newly supplied from the predictive residual<br>
decoding section 315 for MA prediction of the next<br>
processing frame.<br>
The explanation so far describes the content of a<br>
series of processes after the LSF parameter is input to<br>
the vector quantization apparatus until the LPC code is<br>
output. On the other hand, the decoder of the LSF<br>
parameters output from the vector quantization apparatus<br>
(also the decoder of the LPC coefficients obtained by<br>
converting the LSF parameters) can comprise a step of<br>
decomposing an LPC code into four index information pieces<br>
(Nlcand_k[J], Nlcand_m[J], N2Lcand[J] and N2Hcand[J]),<br>
a step of calculating a decodedpredictive residual vector<br>
based on each piece of index information obtained in the<br><br>
step of decomposing an LPC code and a step of generating<br>
a decoded LSF vector based on the decoded predictive<br>
residual vector obtained in the step of calculating a<br>
decoded predictive residual vector. More specifically,<br>
in the step of decomposing an LPC code, an LPC code is<br>
decomposed into four index information pieces<br>
(Nlcand_k[J], Nlcand_m[J], N2Lcand[J] and N2Hcand[J])<br>
first.  Then, in the step of calculating a decoded<br>
predictive residual vector, by reading the first stage<br>
codevector CNicand_ni[jj from the first stage codebook 305<br>
based on index information Nlcand_m[ J] , then reading the<br>
second stage lower frequency codevector C2LN2Lcand[j] from<br>
the second stage lower frequency codebook 309 based on<br>
the index information N2Lcand[J], reading second stage<br>
higher frequency codevector C2HN2Hcand[j) from the second<br>
stage higher frequency codebook 312 based on index<br>
information N2Hcand[J] and carrying out the addition<br>
processing described in Expression (9) on the three read<br>
vectors, it is possible to obtain a decoded predictive<br>
residual vector Cqj[i] (i=l,...,N) corresponding to the LPC<br>
code.  Then, in the step of creating a decoded LSF vector,<br>
by reading MANiCand_k[j] [0] [i] corresponding to index<br>
information Nlcand_k[JJ from the predictive coefficient<br>
codebook 302 and according to Expression (10) using the<br>
read MANicand_k[jj [0] [i], the average LSF parameter AV[i]<br>
(i=l,...,N) read from the average LSF storage section 323,<br>
XNicand ku) corresponding to Nlcand_k[J] of the<br>
quantization target vector supplied from the predictive<br><br>
residual calculation section 304 and Cgj[i] (i = l,...,N)<br>
supplied from the predictive residual decoding section<br>
315, it is possible to obtain a final decoded LSFparameter<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "LSFqjfi], i=l,_.,N") . By the<br>
way, when the decoded LSF parameter is further converted<br>
to a decoded LPC coefficient, it is possible to provide<br>
a step having the same function as that of the LSF/LPC<br>
coefficient conversion section 317 after the<br>
above-described step of generating a decoded LSF vector.<br>
When LSF parameters are vector-quantized, the<br>
vector quantization apparatus having a 2-stage split<br>
structure using third-order MA prediction explained in<br>
detail so far preliminarily selects codes using a weighted<br>
Euclidean distortion as a measure, and can thereby select<br>
optimum codes for the remaining candidates after the<br>
pre-selection using CD (Cepstram Distortion) as a<br>
reference measure.<br>
Therefore, using the vector quantization apparatus<br>
according to the embodiment above can solve the problem<br>
of the conventional technology (problem that an LPC code<br>
selected by the vector quantization apparatus does not<br>
match the index of the codevector that minimizes CD)<br>
without drastically increasing the amount of calculation<br>
required for an LPC codebook search and improve the<br>
performance of the LPC parameter vector quantization<br>
apparatus.<br>
By the way, according to the vector quantization<br>
apparatus of the present invention, the first stage VQ<br><br>
pre-selection section 307 controls the number of<br>
codevectors to be selected preliminarily and can thereby<br>
freely control the increment in the amount of calculation<br>
required for an LPC codebook search as in the case of<br>
Embodiment 1. That is, the present invention can improve<br>
the performance of the vector quantizer taking account<br>
of the increment in the amount of calculation required<br>
for an LPC codebook search.<br>
Furthermore, this embodiment has described the case<br>
where the number of codevector candidates Nl left by the<br>
first stage VQ pre-selection section 307 is predetermined<br>
(Nl is often determined through experiments or<br>
empirically to values such as 8, 16, 32 and 64), but it<br>
is also possible to use other pre-selection methods, for<br>
example, setting a threshold as a weighted Euclidean<br>
distortion and leaving candidates whose weighted<br>
Euclidean distortion is smaller than the set threshold<br>
as candidates after the pre-selection and similar<br>
effect/operation can be obtained in this case, too.<br>
Furthermore, this embodiment has described the case<br>
where' the first stage VQ pre-selection section 307<br>
preliminarily selects codevectors using the weighted<br>
Euclidean distortion in Expression (2) above as a measure,<br>
but the present invention can also be implemented when<br>
a weighted Euclidean distortion whose mathematical<br>
expression is different from Expression (2) above such<br>
as Expression (8) or Expression (10) in the aforementioned<br>
Document 4 is used, and similar effect/operation to those<br><br>
of this embodiment can be obtained in this case, too.<br>
By the way, with respect to "weight" of a weighted<br>
Euclidean distortion, various calculation methods have<br>
been proposed (e.g., the method of carrying out weighting<br>
according to a distortion between neighboring elements<br>
of LSF parameters described in Document 5 or the method<br>
of carrying out weighting according to a power spectrum<br>
of a quantization target described in Document 6), but<br>
the present invention is applicable irrespective of the<br>
method of calculating "weight" and similar<br>
effect/operation can be obtained in this case, too.<br>
Furthermore, this embodiment has described the case<br>
where input vector is an LSF vector, but this embodiment<br>
is also applicable to cases where other parameters<br>
expressing short-time spectral envelope information of<br>
a speech signal such as LSP vector, PARCOR coefficients<br>
or an LPC vector is vector-quantized and similar<br>
effect/operation can be obtained in this case, too.<br>
Furthermore, this embodiment has described the case<br>
where the LPC code final search section 321 specifies<br>
a final LPC code using CD (Cepstral Distortion) as a measure,<br>
but it is also possible to replace the LPC coef f icient/LPC<br>
cepstrum conversion sections 318 and 320 with the LPC<br>
coefficient/FFT power spectrum calculation section<br>
having the function of calculating an FFT power spectrum<br>
from the LPC coefficient and further changing the<br>
calculation expression carried out by the LPC code final<br>
search section 32 from Expression (11) above to the<br><br>
calculation expression in the square root portion in<br>
Expression (4) above to use the SD (Spectral Distortion)<br>
as the final measure of the LPC code search section, and<br>
similar effect/operation can be obtained in this case,<br>
too.<br>
Furthermore, this embodiment has described an<br>
example of a vector quantizer having a specific structure<br>
called "2-stage split structure using third-order MA<br>
prediction." for simplicity of explanation, but this<br>
embodiment is also applicable to an LPC parameter vector<br>
quantization apparatus having a structure other than this<br>
example and similar effect/operation can be obtained in<br>
this case, too.<br>
This embodiment explained above is preferably<br>
applicable to coding/decoding of short-time spectral<br>
envelope information of a speech signal in a speech<br>
coder/decoder based on a CELP system or Vocoder system.<br>
(Embodiment 3)<br>
FIG. 6 is a block diagram showing a configuration<br>
of a vector quantization apparatus according to<br>
Embodiment 3.  By the way, components of the vector<br>
quantization apparatus shown in FIG.6 common to those<br>
in FIG. 5 explained in Embodiment 2 are assigned the same<br>
reference numerals as those in FIG.5 and detailed<br>
explanations thereof will be omitted.<br>
The vector quantization apparatus shown in FIG.6<br>
adopts a configuration with a lower frequency scaling<br><br>
factor codebook 350 and a higher frequency scaling factor<br>
codebook 360 added to the vector quantization apparatus<br>
in FIG.5. By the way, in FIG.6, components 301 to 306<br>
and 316 to 323 are omitted to make drawings easier to<br>
see.<br>
By the way, as in the case of Embodiment 2, the<br>
configuration of the vector quantization apparatus<br>
strongly depends on the bit rate of the entire speech<br>
coder/decoder and the number of bits allocated to the<br>
LPC parameter vector quantization apparatus.  Here, for<br>
simplicity of explanation, suppose bit information with<br>
21 bits per processing frame of a time interval of 20<br>
ms is assigned.<br>
Furthermore, suppose the vector quantization<br>
apparatus which will be explained in this embodiment also<br>
uses third-order MA (Moving Average) prediction<br>
technology and uses 4 sets of (2 bits required as switching<br>
information) MA predictive coefficients per processing<br>
frame.  Furthermore, suppose the vector quantization<br>
apparatus which will be explained in this embodiment uses<br>
a 2-stage vector quantization technology.  Furthermore,<br>
suppose the vector quantization apparatus which will be<br>
explained in this embodiment uses a split vector<br>
quantization technology for the second stage of the<br>
2-stage vector quantization apparatus.  By the way,<br>
suppose that the first stage vector quantizer, the vector<br>
quantizer of the second stage lower frequency component<br>
and the vector quantizer of the second stage higher<br><br>
frequency component are assigned 7 bits, 6 bits and 6<br>
bits, respectively.<br>
The vector quantization apparatus in FIG. 6 carries<br>
out processing after an LSF parameter is input until a<br>
target vector of the first stage vector quantizer is<br>
obtained (processing corresponding to the weight<br>
calculation section 301, predictive coefficient codebook<br>
302, MA predictor 303 and predictive residual calculation<br>
section 304) .  By the way, the details of the processing<br>
are the same as those of the processing of the corresponding<br>
sections in Embodiment 2, and therefore explanations<br>
thereof will be omitted in this embodiment.<br>
Then, the vector quantization apparatus in FIG. 6<br>
carries out the processing by the first stage vector<br>
quantizer of the 2-stage vector quantizer (processing<br>
corresponding to the first stage codebook 305, first stage<br>
distortion calculation section 306, first stage VQ<br>
pre-search section 307 and first stage VQ residual<br>
calculation section 308).<br>
The processing of the first stage vector quantizer<br>
by the 2-stage vector quantizer of the vector quantization<br>
apparatus according to this embodiment will be explained<br>
in detail below.<br>
The first stage codebook 305 stores 128 entries of<br>
predictive residual codevectors.  The 128 entries of<br>
predictive residual codevectors are acquired beforehand<br>
by carrying out the above-described series of processes<br>
until a quantization target is calculated on speech<br><br>
signals in many processing frames, obtaining many<br>
predictive residual vectors, applying an LBG algorithm<br>
to the many predictive residual vectors obtained,<br>
extracting 128 entries of typical samples of predictive<br>
residual vectors and applying a generalization Lloyd<br>
algorithm disclosed in the aforementioned Document 8,<br>
etc., to the 128 entries of typical vectors extracted.<br>
The first stage distortion calculation section 306<br>
calculates a weighted Euclidean distortion between a<br>
target vector (X* [i], i=l,».,N) of the first stage vector<br>
quantizer supplied from the predictive residual<br>
calculation section 304 and a vector<br>
(MAk[0] [i]*Cm[i] ,i=l,...,N) obtained by multiplying the<br>
predictive residual codevector (Cm[i], i=l,..., N) with<br>
index m read from the first stage codebook 305 by the<br>
current processing frame component (MAk[0] [i] , i=l, ...,N)<br>
of the MA predictive coefficient according to Expression<br>
(6) and outputs the calculated distortion value to the<br>
first stage VQ pre-selection section 307.  By the way,<br>
the weighted Euclidean distortion is calculated by the<br>
first stage distortion calculation section 306 in the<br>
same way as for Embodiment 2 in that the calculation is<br>
performed on all combinations (512=128x4) of 4 sets<br>
(k=l,..., 4) of MA predictive coefficients used to generate<br>
128 entries (m=l,..., 128) of predictive residual<br>
codevectors (Cn[i] , i = l,._,N) stored in the first stage<br>
codebook 305 and target vectors (Xk[i], i-1,..., N) supplied<br>
from the predictive residual calculation section 304.<br><br>
Therefore, a total of 512 distortions dk, m (k=l,..., 4,<br>
m=l,...,128) are output from the first stage distortion<br>
calculation section 306 to the first stage VQ<br>
pre-selection section 307 in this embodiment/ too.<br>
The first stage VQ pre-selection section 307<br>
compares aforementiontioned 512 distortions dk/m<br>
(k=l,...,4, m=l, •••, 128) supplied from the first stage<br>
distortion calculation section 306, selects Nl types of<br>
combination information of k (to which third-order<br>
predictive coefficient set of the 4 sets of third-order<br>
MA predictive coefficients corresponds)and m (to which<br>
codevector of the 128 entries of codevectors in the first<br>
stage codebook 305 corresponds) , and records the selected<br>
k and m into Nlcand_k[j] and Nlcand_m[j] respectively,<br>
and outputs the recorded Nlcand__k[j] and Nlcand_m[j]<br>
(j=l,...,Nl) to the first stage VQ residual calculation<br>
section 308, predictive residual decoding section 315<br>
and decoded LSF generation section 316.<br>
Furthermore, according to this embodiment, the first<br>
stage VQ pre-selection section 307 also outputs<br>
Nlcand_m[j] (j=l,—,Nl) to the lower frequency scaling<br>
factor codebook 350 and higher frequency scaling factor<br>
codebook 360.<br>
The first stage VQ residual calculation section 308<br>
calculates Nl first stage VQ residual vectors X3l2l[i]<br>
(i=l,...,N, j = l,...,Nl) that remain after carrying out<br>
pre-selection processing using third-order predictive<br>
coefficient set (read from the predictive coefficient<br><br>
codebook 302) corresponding to information on Nl<br>
combinations of Nlcand_k[j] and Nlcand_m[ j ] (j«l,—#Nl)<br>
supplied from the first stage VQ pre-selection section<br>
307 and codevectors (read from the first stage codebook<br>
305) in the first stage codebook according to Expression<br>
(7) and outputs the calculated Nl vectors to the second<br>
stage lower frequency distortion calculation section<br>
310 and second stage higher frequency distortion<br>
calculation section 311.<br>
By the way, as in the case of Embodiment 2, suppose<br>
the second stage vector quantizer of this embodiment also<br>
has a split structure, decomposing (splitting) the first<br>
stage VQ residual vector into a lower frequency components<br>
(i=l,...,NL) and higher frequency components (i=NL+l,..., N)<br>
and vector-quantizing the respective vectors separately.<br>
Therefore, Xd(2)[i] (i=l,...,N, j = l,—,Nl) calculated<br>
by the first stage VQ residual vector calculation section<br>
308 is output to the second stage lower frequency<br>
distortion calculation section 310 and second stage<br>
higher frequency distortion calculation section 311 in<br>
accordance with the configuration of the second stage<br>
vector quantizer.  More specif ically, Xj(2) [i] (i=l,...,NL,<br>
j = l,...,Nl) is output to the second stage  lower frequency<br>
distortion calculation section 310 and Xj'2)[i]<br>
(i=NL+l,...,N, j«l,—fNl) is output to the second stage<br>
higher frequency distortion calculation section 311.<br>
This is the explanation of the processing by the<br>
first stage vector quantizer of the 2-stage vector<br><br>
quantizer.<br>
The vector quantization apparatus in FIG. 6 then<br>
performs the processing by the second stage vector<br>
quantizer of the 2-stage vector quantizer (processing<br>
corresponding to the second stage lower frequency •<br>
codebook 309/ lower frequency scaling factor codebook<br>
350, second stage  lower frequency distortion<br>
calculation section 310, second stage  higher frequency<br>

frequency codebook search section 314) .  Thus, this<br>
embodiment will also explain the processing by the<br>
aforementioned second stage vector quantizer of the<br>
2-stage vector quantizer in detail below.<br>
By the way, suppose that the second stage lower<br>
frequency codebook 309 stores 64 entries of second stage<br>
lower frequency codevectors (C2Lm2L,[i], i=l, -, NL,<br>
m2L=l,..., 64) and the second stage higher frequency<br>
codebook 312 store's 64 entries of second stage higher<br>
frequency codevectors (C2Hm2H[i]/ i=NL+l,...,N,<br>
m2H=l,..., 64) .<br>
Furthermore, the lower frequency scaling factor<br>
codebook 350 has the function of storing as many (128<br>
entries in this embodiment) lower frequency scaling<br>
factors (SF_low[j], j=l, 2, ..., Nl) as the predictive<br>
residual codevectors stored in the first stage codebook<br><br>
305 and the function of outputting the lower frequency<br>
scaling factors (SF_low[Nlcand_m[j]]) corresponding to<br>
Nlcand_m[j] supplied from the first stage VQ<br>
pre-selection section 307 to the second stage lower<br>
frequency distortion calculation section 310 and<br>
predictive residual decoding section 315.  Furthermore,<br>
the higher frequency scaling factor codebook 360 has the<br>
function of storing as many (128 entries in this<br>
embodiment) lower frequency scaling factors (SF_high[j],<br>
j = l/ 2, ••', Nl) as the predictive residual codevectors<br>
stored in the first stage codebook 305 and the function<br>
of outputting the lower frequency scaling factors<br>
(SF_high[Nlcand_m[jJ]) corresponding to Nlcand_m[j]<br>
supplied from the first stage VQ pre-selection section<br>
307 to the second stage higher frequency distortion<br>
calculation section 311 and the predictive residual<br>
decoding section 315. By the way, suppose that the lower<br>
frequency scaling factors (SF_low[j], j=l,2, —,N1) and<br>
higher frequency scaling factors (SF_high [jJ, j = l,2,<br>
•••,N1) store values in the range 0.5 to 2.0 acquired<br>
beforehand by a training consisting of the LBG algorithm<br>
and the generalized Lloyd algorithm.<br>
The second stage lower frequency distortion<br>
calculation section 310 calculates a weighted Euclidean<br>
distortion between the lower frequency component X3(2&gt; [i]<br>
(i=l,...,NL, j = l,...,Nl) of the first stage VQ residual vector<br>
supplied from the first stage VQ residual calculation<br>
section 308 and a vector<br><br>

frequency codevector (C2LB2L[iJ / i=l#...,NL) with index m2L<br>
read from the second stage lower frequency codebook 309<br>
by SF_low[Nlcand_m[j] ] supplied from the lower frequency<br>
scaling factor codebook 350 and the current processing<br>
frame component (MANiCandjc[j] [0] [i], i=l, ...,NL) of the MA<br>
predictive coefficient according to Expression (12) below<br>
and outputs the calculated distortion value d2Lj,m2L to<br>
the second stage lower frequency codebook search section<br>
313.<br><br>
■•• Expression (12)<br>
where w[i] in Expression (12) is the same "weight" as<br>
that in Expression (6).<br>
By the way, suppose that the second stage lower<br>
frequency distortion calculation section 310 carries out<br>
distortion calculation according to Expression (12) above<br>
on the 64 entries of codevectors stored in the second<br>
stage lower frequency codebook 309 for each of Nl pieces<br>
of j specified by the first stage VQ pre-selection section<br>
307 and outputs all the calculated weighted Euclidean<br>
distortions d2Lj,m2L (j = l, ...,N1, m2L=l,..., 64) to the second<br>
stage lower frequency codebook search section 313 (a total<br>
of Nl*64 d2Lj,m2L are output) .<br>
The second stage higher frequency distortion<br><br>
calculation section 311 calculates a weighted Euclidean<br>
distortion between a higher frequency component Xjl2)[i]<br>
(i=NL+l, ...,N, j-l,_,Nl) of the first stage VQ residual<br>
vectors supplied from the first stage VQ residual<br>
calculation section 308 and a vector<br>
(MA,,icand_ic[j][0] [i]*SF_high[Nlcand_m[j]]*C2HM2H[i],<br>

codebook 312 by SF_high[Nlcand_m[j]] supplied from the<br>
higher frequency scaling factor codebook 360 and the<br>
current processing frame component (MANic,nd_k[j] [0] [i] ,.<br>
i=NL+l, ...,N) of the MA predictive coefficient according<br>
to Expression (13) below and outputs the calculated<br>
distortion value d2Hj,M2H to the second stage higher<br>
frequency codebook search section 314.<br><br>
where' w[i] in Expression (13) is the same "weight" as<br>
that in Expression (6).<br>
By the way, suppose that the second stage higher<br>
frequency distortion calculation section 311 carries out<br>
distortion calculation according toExpression (13) above<br>
on the 64 entries of codevectors stored in the second<br>
stage higher frequency codebook 309 for each of Nl pieces<br>
of j specified by the first stage VQ pre-selection section<br><br>
307 and outputs all the calculated weighted Euclidean<br>
distortions d2Hj,Bl2H (j = l,...,Nl, m2H=l,..., 64) to the second<br>
stage higher frequency codebook search section 313 (a<br>
to.tal of Nl*64 d2Hj,»2H are output) .<br>
The second stage lower frequency codebook search<br>
section 313 specifies one index m2L that minimizes the<br>
distortion for each j for the weighted Euclidean<br>
distortion d2LjfB2L (j = l,...,Nl, m2L=l,..., 64) supplied from<br>
the second stage  lower frequency distortion<br>
calculation section 310, records the specified Nl<br>
(j=l,...,Nl) indices in N2Lcand[j] (j = l,...,Nl) and outputs<br>
the recorded Nl pieces of N2Lcand[j] (j = l,...,Nl) to the<br>
predictive residual decoding section 315.<br>
The second stage higher frequency codebook search<br>
section 314 specifies one index m2H that minimizes the<br>
distortion for each j for the weighted Euclidean<br>
distortion d2Hj&gt;RI2H (j = l, ...,N1, m2H=l,..., 64) supplied from<br>
the second stage lower frequency distortion calculation<br>
section 310, records the specified Nl (j = l,...,Nl) indices<br>
in N2Hcand[j] (j=l,...,Nl) and outputs the recorded Nl<br>
pieces of N2Hcand[j] (j = l,...,Nl) to the predictive<br>
residual decoding section 315.<br>
This is the explanation of the processing by the<br>
second stage vector quantizer of the second stage vector<br>
quantizer.  By the way, by the time the processing by the<br>
above-described second stage vector quantizer is<br>
completed, Nl (j=l,-",Nl) pieces of combination<br>
information with the following four information items<br><br>
have been supplied to the predictive residual decoding<br>
section 315.<br>
(1)	Nlcand_k[j]:  Which of 4 sets of MA predictive<br>
coefficients is preliminarily selected<br>
(2)	Nlcand_ra[j]: Which of 128 entries of first stage<br>
codevectors is preliminarily selected<br><br>
(3)	N2Lcand[j] : Which of 64 entries of second stage lower<br>
frequency codevectors is preliminarily selected<br>
(4)	N2Hcand[j] : Which of 64 entries of second stage higher<br>
frequency codevectors is preliminarily selected<br>
The following explanations of this embodiment will<br>
give details of the processing of specifying the<br>
combination number of information on combinations of<br>
information that minimizes CD from among Nl pieces of<br>
combination information supplied to the predictive<br>
residual decoding section 315 (processing corresponding<br>
to the predictive residual"decoding section 315, decoded<br>
LSF generation section 316, LSF/LPC coefficient<br>
conversion sections 317 and 319, LPC coefficient/LPC<br>
cepstrum conversion sections 318 and 320 and LPC code<br>
final search section 321).<br>
The predictive residual decoding section 315 reads<br>
the first stage codevector Cmcand_m[j]# lower frequency<br>
scaling factor SF_low[Nlcand_m[ j ]] and higher frequency<br>
scaling factor SF_high [Nlcand_m [ j ] ] from the first stage<br>
codebook 305, lower frequency scaling factor codebook<br>
350 and higher frequency scaling factor codebook 360,<br>
respectively, based on the supplied index information<br><br>
Nlcand_m[j] and further reads the second stage lower<br>
frequency codevector C2LN2Lcand[j j from the second stage<br>
lower frequency codebook 309 based on the supplied index<br>
information N2Lcand[j], further reads the second stage<br>
higher frequency codevector C2HN2Hc«nd[3j from the second<br>
stage higher frequency codebook 312 based on the supplied<br>
index information N2Hcand[j],and calculates Nl<br>
(J=1,...,N1) decoded predictive residual vectors Cq3[i]<br>
(i=l,...,N) according to Expression (14) using those<br>
codevectors, records/retains the calculated decoded<br>
predictive residual vectors and outputs them to the<br>
decoded LSF generation section 316.<br><br>
where in Expression (14) , C2LN2Lcand[j] [i]-0.0 (i-NL+1, ...,N) ,<br>
C2HN2HcandU] [i]=0.0 (i=l,...,NL) .<br>
The predictive residual decoding section 315 also<br>
outputs Nlcand_k[j] (j = l = l, — , Nl) to the decoded LSF<br>
generation section 316.<br>
The decoded LSF generation section 316 reads<br>
MANicand_k[j] [0] [i] corresponding to Nlcand_k[j]<br>
(j = l/...,Nl) supplied from the predictive residual decoding<br>
section 315 from the predictive coefficient codebook 302,<br>
calculates Nl (j = l,...,Nl) decoded LSF parameters<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "LSFqj [i] , j=l,..., Nl,<br>
i = l,...,N") according to Expression (10) using the read<br>
MANic.nd_k[3j [0] [i], average LSF parameter AV[i] (i=l,...,N)<br><br>
read from the average LSF storage section 323,<br>
XNicand_k[jj [i] corresponding to Nlcand_k[j] of the<br>
quantization target vector supplied from the predictive<br>
residual calculation section 304 and Cqj[i] (i-l,_,N)<br>
supplied from the predictive residual decoding section<br>
315 and outputs the calculated decoded LSF parameters<br>
to the LSF/LPC coefficient conversion section 317.<br>
The LSF/LPC coefficient conversion section 317<br>
converts Nl (j=l,...,Nl) decoded LSF parameters<br>
(LSFq3 [i], j=l,...,Nl, 1-1,-,N) supplied from the decoded<br>
LSF generation section 316 to decoded LPC coefficients<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "LPCqj [i], j=l#...,Nl,<br>
i=l,...,N") and outputs the decoded LPC coefficients to<br>
the LPC coef f icient/LPC cepstrum conversion section 318.<br>
As in the case of Embodiment 2, the LPC<br>
coef f icient/LPC cepstrum conversion section 318 converts<br>
Nl (j-l,_,Nl) decoded LPC-coefficients (LPCqj[i],<br>
1*1,..., N) supplied from the LSF/LPC coefficient conversion<br>
section 317 to decoded LPC cepstra (hereinafter referred<br>
to as "QCEPj[i], i=l,...,Nc, j = l,...,Nl") and outputs the<br>
decoded LPC cepstra to the LPC code final search section<br>
321.<br>
The LSF/LPC coefficient conversion section 319<br>
converts the LSF parameters to LPC coefficients and<br>
outputs the LPC coefficients to the LPC coefficient/LPC<br>
cepstrum conversion section 320.  The LPC<br>
coef ficient/LPC cepstrum conversion section 320 converts<br>
the LPC coefficients supplied from the LSF/LPC<br><br>
coefficient conversion section 319 to LPC cepstra<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "CEPt[iJ, i=l/.../Nc") and<br>
outputs the LPC cepstra to the LPC code final search<br>
section 321.<br>
The LPC code final search section 321 first<br>
calculates distortions DISj (j*=l,...,Nl) between the LPC<br>
cepstrum coefficients (CEPt[i], i-l,._,Nc) supplied from<br>
the LPC coefficient/LPC cepstrum conversion section 320<br>
andNl (j=l,...,Nl) decoded LPC cepstra (QCEP3[i], i=l,...,Nc,<br>
j = l,.../Nl) supplied from the LPC coef ficient/LPC cepstrum<br>
conversion section 318 according to Expression (11)/<br>
compares the sizes of the calculated Nl pieces of DISj,<br>
specifies one index "J" that minimizes DISj and outputs<br>
21-bit information combining the following four<br>
information items corresponding to the specified index<br>
MJ", that is:<br>
(1)	Nlcand_k[J] : Which of "4 sets of MA predictive<br>
coefficients is optimal (using 2 bits)<br>
(2)	Nlcand_m[J]: Which of 128 entries of first stage<br>
codevectors is optimal (using 7 bits)<br>
(3)	N2Lcand[J] : Which of 64 entries of second stage lower<br>
frequency codevectors is optimal (using 6 bits)<br>
(4)	N2Hcand[ J] : Which of 64 entries of second stage higher<br>
frequency codevectors is optimal (using 6 bits)<br>
as an LPC code of the relevant processing frame (code<br>
to express spectral envelope information on the<br>
processing frame section).<br>
As in the case of Embodiment 2, the LPC code final<br><br>
search section 321 also supplies index J that minimizes<br>
DISj to the predictive residual decoding section 315.<br>
Then, the predictive residual decoding section 315<br>
selects vectors Cqj[i] (i=l,...,N) corresponding to the<br>
index J from among Nl (j=l/-./Nl) retained/stored decoded<br>
predictive residual vectors Cqj [i] (i=l,...,N) and outputs<br>
the vectors to the decoding predictive residual storage<br>
section 322.<br>
The decoding predictive residual storage section<br>
322 discards the oldest decoded predictive residual<br>
vector out of the decoded predictive residual vectors<br>
corresponding to a plurality of past stored frames (the<br>
decoded predictive residual vectors corresponding to the<br>
past 3 frames are stored because this embodiment carries<br>
out third-order MA prediction) and newly retains Cqj[i]<br>
(i=l,...,N) newly supplied from the predictive residual<br>
decoding section 315 for MA prediction in the next<br>
processing frame.<br>
The explanation so far describes the content of the<br>
series of processes after LSF parameters are input to<br>
the vector quantization apparatus until LPC codes are<br>
output.<br>
On the other hand/ the decoder for LSF parameters<br>
output from the vector quantization apparatus (also the<br>
decoder for LPC coefficients obtained by converting the<br>
LSF parameters) can be constructed of a step of decomposing<br>
an LPC code into four pieces of index information<br>
(Nlcand_k[J], Nlcand_m[ J], N2Lcand[J] and N2Hcand[J]) ,<br><br>
a step of calculating decoded predictive residual vectors<br>
based on each piece of index information obtained in the<br>
step of decomposing an LPC code and a step of generating<br>
decoded LSF vectors based on the decoded predictive<br>
residual vectors obtained in the step of calculating<br>
decoded predictive residual vectors. More specifically,<br>
in the step of decomposing an LPC code, an LPC code is<br>
decomposed into four pieces of index information<br>
{Nlcand_k[J], Nlcand_m[JJ, N2Lcand[J] and N2Hcand[J])<br>
first.  Then, in the step of calculating decoded<br>
predictive residual vectors, by reading first stage<br>
codevector CNicand_m[j], lower frequency scaling factor<br>
SF_low[Nlcand_m[ j ] ] and higher frequency scaling factor<br>
SF_high[Nlcand_m[j]] from the first stage codebook 305,<br>
lower frequency scaling factor codebook 350 and higher<br>
frequency scaling factor codebook 360 based on index<br>
information Nlcand_m[J], then reading the second stage<br>
lower frequency codevector C2LN2Lcanduj from the second<br>
stage lower frequency codebook 309 based on index<br>
information N2Lcand[ J], further reading the second stage<br>
higher frequency codevector C2HN2Hcand[j] from the second<br>
stage higher frequency codebook 312 based on the index<br>
information N2Hcand[J] and using 3 entries of vector and<br>
2 entries of scaling factors read to carry out sum of<br>
products processing according to Expression (14), it is<br>
possible to acquire decoded predictive residual vector<br>
Cqj[i] (i=l,...,N) corresponding to the LPC code.  Then,<br>
in the step of generating a decoded LSF vector, by reading<br><br>
MANicand_k[ji [0] [i] corresponding to index information<br>
Nlcand_k[ J] from the predictive coefficient codebook 302,<br>
and according to Expression (10) using the read<br>
MAniic.ndjctJ] fO] [i], average LSF parameter AV[i] (i=l,...,N)<br>
read from the average LSF storage section 323, XNic«nd_k[jj<br>
corresponding to N.lcand_k[j] of the quantization target<br>
vector supplied from the predictive residual calculation<br>
section 304 and Cqj[i] (i-l,...,N) supplied from the<br>
predictive residual decoding section 315, it is possible<br>
to obtain final decoded LSF parameter (hereinafter<br>
referred to as wLSFqj[i], i=l,.../N") .  By the way, when<br>
the decoded LSFparameter is further converted to a decoded<br>
LPC coefficient, it is possible to further provide a step<br>
having the same function as that of the LSF/LPC coefficient<br>
conversion section 317 after the step of generating the<br>
decoded LSF vector.<br>
According to the vector quantization apparatus<br>
having a 2-stage split structure using third-order MA<br>
prediction further equipped with the lower frequency<br>
scaling factor codebook 350 and higher frequency scaling<br>
factor codebook 360 explained in detail above, it is<br>
possible to adapt the contribution of the second stage<br>
codevector in the whole decoding vector to the codevector<br>
CNicand_m[jj (actually index Nlcand_m[j] corresponding to<br>
codevector CNicand_m[j)) selected in the first stage vector<br>
quantization processing and control it, and thereby<br>
reduce quantization distortion, carry out pre-selection<br>
of a code using the weighted Euclidean distortion as a<br><br>
measure and select an optimum code using CD (Cepstram<br>
Distortion) as a reference measure for the remaining<br>
candidates after the pre-selection, which makes it<br>
passible to vector-quantize LSF parameters with high<br>
accuracy compared to the conventional vector quantization<br>
apparatus.<br>
By the way, according to the vector quantization<br>
apparatus of this embodiment as in the case of Embodiment<br>
2, it is possible to freely control the increment in the<br>
amount of calculation required for an LPC codebook search<br>
by controlling the number of codevectors to be<br>
preliminarily selected by the first stage VQ<br>
pre-selection section 307.  That is, this embodiment<br>
makes it possible to improve the performance of the vector<br>
quantizer while considering the increment in the amount<br>
of calculation required for an LPC codebook search.<br>
Furthermore, this embodiment has described the case<br>
where the number of candidates Nl of codevectors left<br>
by the first stage VQ pre-selection section 307 (Nl is<br>
often determined to values such as 8, 16, 32 and 64 through<br>
experiments or empirically) , but it is also possible to<br>
use other pre-selection methods such as setting a<br>
threshold for the weighted Euclidean distortion and<br>
leaving candidates whose weighted Euclidean distortion<br>
is smaller than the set threshold as the candidates after<br>
the pre-selection and similar effect/operation can be<br>
obtained in this case, too.<br>
Furthermore, this embodiment has described the case<br><br>
where the first stage VQ pre-selection section 307<br>
preliminarily selects codevectors using the weighted<br>
Euclidean distortion in Expression-(2) as a measure, but<br>
this embodiment can also be implemented when a weighted<br>
Euclidean distortion according to expressions different<br>
from Expressions (8) and (10) in the aforementioned<br>
Document 4 is used, and an effect/operation similar to<br>
those of this embodiment can be obtained in this case,<br>
too.<br>
By the way, with respect to "weight" of the weighted<br>
Euclidean distortion, various calculation methods have<br>
been proposed so far (e.g., a method of carrying out<br>
weighting according to a distortion between neighboring<br>
elements of LSF parameters described in Document 5 or<br>
a method of carrying out weighting according to a power<br>
spectrum of a quantization target described in Document<br>
6) , but the present invention is applicable irrespective<br>
of the "weight" calculation method and a similar<br>
effect/operation can be obtained in this case, too.<br>
Furthermore, this embodiment has described the case<br>
where input vectors are LSF parameters, but this<br>
embodiment is also applicable to a case where other<br>
parameters expressing short-time spectral envelope<br>
information of a speech signal such as LSP parameter,<br>
PARCOR coefficient and LPC coefficient are<br>
vector-quantized and a similar effect/operation can be<br>
obtained in this case, too.<br>
Furthermore, this embodiment has described the case<br><br>
where the LPC code final search section 321 specifies<br>
a final LPC code using CD (Cepstral Distortion) asameasure,<br>
but it is also possible to replace the LPC coef f icient/LPC<br>
cepstrum conversion sections 318 and 320 with an LPC<br>
coefficient/FFT power spectrum calculation section<br>
having the function of calculating an FFT power spectrum<br>
from LPC coefficients and further change the calculation<br>
expression used by the LPC code final search section 321<br>
from Expression (11) to the calculation expression in<br>
the square root portion in Expression (4) to use SD<br>
(Spectral Distortion) as the final measure of the LPC<br>
code search section and a similar effect/operation can<br>
be obtained in this case, too.<br>
Furthermore, this embodiment has described the<br>
vector quantizer having a specific structure called<br>
w2-stage split structure using third-order MA prediction<br>
accompanied by scaling factors" as an example, but this<br>
embodiment is also applicable to an LPC parameter vector<br>
quantization apparatus having a structure other than this<br>
example and a similar effect/operation can be obtained<br>
in this case, too.<br>
The above-described embodiment is preferably<br>
applicable to coding/decoding of short-time spectral<br>
envelope information on speech signals of a speech<br>
coder/decoder based on a CELP system or Vocoder system.<br>
(Embodiment 4)<br>
FIG. 7 is a block diagram showing a configuration<br><br>
of a speech signal transmission apparatus and reception<br>
apparatus according to Embodiment 4 of present invention.<br>
In FIG.7, a speech signal is converted to an electric-<br>
signal by an input apparatus 401 of the transmission<br>
apparatus and output to an A/D conversion apparatus 40.2.<br>
The A/D conversion apparatus 402 converts the (analog)<br>
speech signal output from the input apparatus 401 to a<br>
digital signal and outputs the signal to a speech coder<br>
403.<br>
The speech coder 403 codes the digital speech signal<br>
output from the A/D conversion apparatus 402 using a speech<br>
coding method, which will be described later, and outputs<br>
the coded information to an RF modulation apparatus 404.<br>
The RF modulation apparatus 404 converts the speech coded<br>
information output from the speech coder 403 to a signal<br>
to be carried on a propagation medium such as a radio<br>
frequency band and outputs-the signal to a transmission<br>
antenna 405. The transmission antenna 405 sends the<br>
output signal output from the RF modulation apparatus<br>
404 as a radio signal (RF signal).<br>
The RF signal sent from the transmission apparatus<br>
is received by a reception antenna 406 of the reception<br>
apparatus and output to an RF demodulation apparatus 4 07.<br>
The RF demodulation apparatus 407 demodulates speech<br>
coded information from the RF signal output from the<br>
reception antenna 406 and outputs it to the speech decoder<br>
408.<br>
The speech decoder 408 decodes the speech signal<br><br>
according to a speech decoding method, which will be<br>
described later, using the speech coded information<br>
output from the RF demodulation apparatus 4 07 and outputs<br>
it to a D/A conversion apparatus 409.  The D/A conversion<br>
apparatus 409 converts the digital speech signal output<br>
from the speech decoder 408 to an analog electric signal<br>
and outputs it to an output apparatus 410.  The output<br>
apparatus 410 converts the electric signal to air<br>
vibration and outputs it as sound wave audible to human<br>
ears.<br>
By providing at least one of the speech signal<br>
transmission apparatus and reception apparatus in the<br>
above-described configuration, it is possible to<br>
construct a base station apparatus and communication<br>
terminal apparatus in a mobile communication system.<br>
The above-described speech signal transmission<br>
apparatus is characterizedby the speech coder 403.  FIG. 8<br>
is a block diagram showing a configuration of the speech<br>
coder 403.  In FIG. 8, an input speech signal is the signal<br>
output from the A/D conversion apparatus 402 in FIG.7<br>
r<br>
and input to a pre-processing section 501. The<br>
pre-processing section 501 carries out high pass filter<br>
processing for removing a DC component, waveform shaping<br>
processing and pre-emphasis processing which will lead<br>
to a performance improvement of the subsequent coding<br>
processing on the input speech signal and outputs the<br>
processed signal to an LPC analysis section 502, an adder<br>
505 and a parameter decision section 513 (Xin).<br><br>
The LPC analysis section 502 carries out a linear<br>
predictive analysis using Xin and outputs the result (LPC<br>
vector/LPC coefficients) to an LPC quantization section<br>
50-3.  The LPC quantization section 503 converts the LPC<br>
vector output from the LPC analysis section 502 to an<br>
LSF parameter and vector-quantizes the LSF vector<br>
obtained through the conversion using the method shown<br>
in Embodiments 1, 2 and 3 and outputs the LPC code (L)<br>
obtained by vector quantization to a multiplexing section<br>
514.<br>
The LPC quantization section 503 further obtains<br>
decoded LPC vector in the LSF domain using the LPC vector<br>
decoding method shown in Embodiments 1, 2 and 3, converts<br>
the decoded LPC(LSF) vector obtained to decoded LPC<br>
coefficients and outputs the decoded LPC coefficients<br>
obtained by the conversion to a synthesis filter 504.<br>
The synthesis filter- 504 carries out a filter<br>
synthesis using the decoded LPC coefficients and an<br>
excitation vector output from an adder 511 and outputs<br>
the synthesis signal to the adder 505.  The adder 505<br>
calculates an error signal between Xin and the synthesis<br>
signal and outputs the error signal to a perceptual<br>
weighting section 512.<br>
The perceptual weighting section 512 carries out<br>
perceptual weighting on the error signal output from the<br>
adder 505, calculates distortion between Xin and the<br>
synthesis signal in the perceptual weighted domain and<br>
outputs it to the parameter decision section 513. The<br><br>
parameter decision section 513 decides the signal to be<br>
generated from an adaptive excitation codebook 506, a<br>
fixed excitation codebook 508 and quantization gain<br>
generation section 507 so that the coding distortion<br>
output from the perceptual weighting section 512 is<br>
minimized.<br>
By the way, it is also possible to further improve<br>
the coding performance not only by minimizing the coding<br>
distortion output from the perceptual weighting section<br>
512 but also by deciding the signal to be generated from<br>
the three means using another coding distortion using<br>
Xin.<br>
The adaptive excitation codebook 506 buffers<br>
excitation signals output in the past from the adder 511,<br>
extracts adaptive excitation vectors from the position<br>
specified by a signal (A) output from the parameter<br>
decision section 513 and outputs them to a multiplier<br>
509.  The fixed excitation codebook 508 outputs vectors<br>
having a shape specified by a signal (F) output from the<br>
parameter decision section 513 to a multiplier 510.<br>
The quantization gain generation section 507<br>
outputs the adaptive excitation gain and fixed excitation<br>
gain specified by a signal (G) output from the parameter<br>
decision section 513 to the multipliers 509 and 510<br>
respectively.<br>
The multiplier 509 multiplies the adaptive<br>
excitation vector output from the adaptive excitation<br>
codebook 506 by the quantization adaptive excitation gain<br><br>
output from the quantization gain generation section 507<br>
and outputs the multiplication result to the adder 511.<br>
The multiplier 510 multiplies the fixed excitation gain<br>
output from the fixed excitation codebook 508 by the fixed<br>
excitation vector output from the quantization gain<br>
generation section 507 and outputs the multiplication<br>
result to the adder 511.<br>
The adder 511 inputs the adaptive excitation vector<br>
and fixed excitation vector after the gain multiplication<br>
from the multipliers 509 and 510 respectively, carries<br>
out a vector addition and outputs the addition result<br>
to the synthesis filter 504 and the adaptive excitation<br>
codebook 506.<br>
Finally, the multiplexing section 514 inputs a code<br>
L representing a quantization LPC from the LPC<br>
quantization section 503, inputs a code A representing<br>
an adaptive excitation vector, a code F representing a<br>
fixed excitation vector and a code G representing a<br>
quantization gain from the parameter decision section<br>
513 and multiplexes these pieces of information and<br>
outputs the multiplexed information as coded information<br>
to a transmission path.<br>
FIG. 9 is a block diagram showing a configuration<br>
of the speech decoder 408 in FIG.7.  In FIG.9, the<br>
multiplexed coded information output from the RF<br>
demodulation section 407 is demultiplexed into individual<br>
coded information pieces by a demultiplexing section 601.<br>
A demultiplexed LPC code L is output to an LPC<br><br>
decoding section 602, a demultiplexed adaptive excitation<br>
vector code A is output to an adaptive excitation codebook<br>
605, a demultiplexed excitation gain code G is output<br>
tor a quantization gain generation section 606 and a<br>
demultiplexed fixed excitation vector code F is output<br>
to a fixed excitation codebook 607.<br>
An LPC decoding section 602 acquires a decoded LPC<br>
vector from the code L (which means the LPC code in<br>
Embodiments 1, 2 and 3) output from the demultiplexing<br>
section 601 using the decoded LPC vector generation method<br>
shown in Embodiments 1, 2 and 3, converts the acquired<br>
decoded LPC vector to decoded LPC coefficients and outputs<br>
the decoded LPC coefficients obtained by the conversion<br>
to a synthesis filter 603.<br>
The adaptive excitation codebook 605 extracts an<br>
adaptive excitation vector from a position specified by<br>
the code A output from the demultiplexing section 601<br>
and outputs it to a multiplier 608. The fixed excitation<br>
codebook 607 generates a fixed excitation vector<br>
specified by the code F output from the demultiplexing<br>
section 601 and outputs it to a multiplier 609.<br>
The quantization gain generation section 606<br>
decodes the adaptive excitation vector gain and fixed<br>
excitation vector gain specified by the excitation gain<br>
code G output from the demultiplexing section 601 and<br>
outputs the gains to multipliers 60 8 and 609 respectively.<br>
The multiplier 608 multiplies the adaptive codevector<br>
by the adaptive codevector gain and outputs the<br><br>
multiplication result to an adder 610.  The multiplier<br>
609 multiplies the fixed codevector by the fixed<br>
codevector gain and outputs the multiplication result<br>
to. the adder 610.<br>
The adder 610 adds up the adaptive excitation vector<br>
and the fixed excitation vector after the gain<br>
multiplication output from the multipliers 608 and 609<br>
and outputs the addition result to the synthesis filter<br>
603.  The synthesis filter 603 carries out a filter<br>
synthesis using the excitation vector output from the<br>
adder 610 as a sound source signaland a synthesis filter<br>
constructed with the decoded LPC coefficients supplied<br>
from the LPC decoding section 602 as the filter coefficient,<br>
and outputs the synthesized signal to a post-processing<br>
section 604.<br>
The post-processing section 604 carries out<br>
processing of improving subjective speech quality such<br>
as formant emphasis and/or pitch emphasis, and processing<br>
of improving subjective speech quality of stationary<br>
noise segments, etc., and outputs the processed signal<br>
as a final decoded speech signal.<br>
Thus, applying the LPC vector quantization<br>
apparatus according to the present invention to a speech<br>
coder/decoder makes it possible to obtain synthesized<br>
speech of higher quality than that of a speech<br>
coder/decoder using a conventional vector quantization<br>
apparatus.<br>
Furthermore, the above-described speech<br><br>
coder/decoder is also applicable to a communication<br>
apparatus such as a base station apparatus and mobile<br>
station in a digital radio communication system. This<br>
makes it possible to obtain synthesized speech of higher<br>
quality than that using a conventional vector<br>
quantization apparatus in a digital radio communication<br>
system.<br>
The present invention is not limited to Embodiments<br>
1 to 3 above, but can be implemented modified in various<br>
ways.  For example/ the vector quantization/decoding of<br>
an LPC vector according to Embodiments 1, 2 and 3 has<br>
been explained as a vector quantization apparatus or<br>
speech coder/speech decoder, but vector<br>
quantization/decoding of an LPC vector can also be<br>
implemented by software.  For example, it is possible to<br>
store the above-described LPC vector<br>
quantization/decoding program in a ROM and execute the<br>
program according to instructions from a CPU.<br>
Furthermore, it is possible to store an LPC vector<br>
quantization/decoding program in a computer-readable<br>
storage medium, record the LPC parameter vector<br>
quantization/decoding program of this storage medium in<br>
a RAM of a computer and operate it according to the vector<br>
quantization program.  An operation/effect similar to<br>
those of Embodiments 1, 2 and 3 above can also be obtained<br>
in this case, too.<br>
As is apparent from the above-described<br>
explanations, when LPC parameters representing<br><br>
short-time spectral envelope information of a speech<br>
signal are vector-quantized, the present invention can<br>
preliminarily select a small number of codevectors using<br>
a .(weighted) Euclidean distortion as a measure, carry<br>
out a codebook search (specification of a final LPC code)<br>
using an amount of distortion of a spectral space such<br>
as CD (Cepstram Distortion) or SD (Spectral Distortion)<br>
as a reference measure, and consequently provide a vector<br>
quantizer with higher performance than the conventional<br>
vector quantization apparatus using only a (weighted)<br>
Euclidean distortion as a reference measure for a codebook<br>
search (distortion in a spectral space such as CD and<br>
SD is smaller than the conventional one).<br>
Furthermore, applying the LPC vector quantization<br>
apparatus according to the present invention to a speech<br>
coder/decoder makes it possible to obtain synthesized<br>
speech of higher quality .than that of a speech<br>
coder/decoder using a conventional vector quantization<br>
apparatus.<br>
