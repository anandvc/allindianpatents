				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a fungicidal composition<br>
comprising a fungicidally acceptable carrier and/or surface active agent<br>
and synergistically effective amounts of<br>
(a) at least one azolopyrimidine of formula I<br>
in which<br>
R1 and R2 each independently represent hydrogen or an optionally<br>
substituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkadienyl, aryl, heteroaryl.<br>
cydoalkyl, bicydoalkyl or heterocyclyl group, or<br>
R1 and R2 together with the adjacent nitrogen atom represent an optionally<br>
substituted heterocyclic ring,<br>
R3 represents a hydrogen or a halogen atom or an alkyl group,<br>
R4 represents hydrogen or an alkyl or aryl group,<br>
L represents a halogen atom or an optionally substituted alkyl or alkoxy<br>
group,<br>
A represents N or CR5, wherein R5 has the meaning given for R4, and<br>
n is 0 or an integer between 1 and 5; and<br>
(b) and at least one fungicidal active ingredient which is capable of<br>
inhibiting the melanin biosynthesis in particular in Pyricularia oryzae<br>
the causal agent of the rice blast disease.<br>
The fungicidal compounds of formula I are known from US patents<br>
US 4,567,263 and US 5,593,996.<br>
The class of melanin biosynthesis inhibitors (MBI) are chemical<br>
compounds which are capable of diminishing the in-vivo synthesis of<br>
melanin by inhibiting any of the reductase and/or dehydratase enzymes<br>
which are responsible for converting tetrahydroxynaphthalene into<br>
dihydroxynaphthalene. This class of compounds includes the following<br>
known compounds: carpropamid. chlobenthiazione, diclocymet.<br>
pyroquilon, phthalide, tricyclazole and certain phenoxyamides, which are<br>
known for example from EP 0 262 393 and Japanese patent application<br>
JP 5-9165-A.<br>
However, there is no hint to combine the compounds of formula I,<br>
with a MBI. Moreover, there is no hint that such mixtures can be<br>
advantageously be used for controlling rice diseases such as rice blast<br>
and rice sheath blight and others.<br>
Surprisingly, a strong synergy between the compounds of formula I<br>
and MBIs in field trials was found when these two compounds were in-<br>
tank mixed and when the activity of these co-formulations was compared<br>
with that of the solo formulations of each active ingredient.<br>
A mixture of fungicides shows synergistic effect if the fungicidal<br>
activity of the mixture is larger than the sum of activities of the separately<br>
applied compounds. The expected fungicidal activity for a given mixture of<br>
two fungicides can also be calculated as follows (See Colby, S.R.,<br>
"Calculating synergistic and antagonistic response of herbicide<br>
combinations". Weeds 15, pp 20-22 (1967):<br>
wherein <br>
x is the efficacy in % compared with an untreated control upon<br>
treatment with a fungicidal active ingredient A at a dose rate a;<br>
y is the efficacy in % compared with an untreated control upon<br>
treatment with a fungicidal active ingredient B at a dose rate b;<br>
EE is the expected efficacy with a combination of fungicidal active<br>
ingredients A and B at a dose of a + b, respectively.<br>
if the actual efficacy (E) exceeds the expected (calculated) one<br>
(EE), the mixture displays a synergistic effect.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention includes a fungicidal composition comprising:<br>
(a) at least one azolopyrlmldlne of formula (la)<br>
in which<br>
R1 represents C1-C6-alky1,C1-6-haloalkyl, or<br>
R2 represents hydrogen, or<br>
R1 and R2 together vvith the adjacent nitrogen atom represent a 4-methyl<br>
pipendine ring,<br>
L represents a halogen atom,<br>
n is 0 or an Integer between 1 and 5; and<br>
(b) at least one fungicidal active ingredient which is oapable of inhibiting the<br>
biosynthesis of melanin selected from the group consisting of carpropamid,<br>
chlobenthlazione, dlcyclocymet, pyroquilon, phthalide, trlcylazole and a<br>
phenoxyamlde of formula (lla),<br>
in whioh Y" represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, and<br>

about 4:1.<br>
The active compounds will be formulated together in a suitable ratio<br>
according to the present invention, together with usual carriers and/or<br>
additives known in the art.<br>
Accordingly the invention further provides a fungicidal composition<br>
which comprises a carrier and, as active ingredient, at ieast one compound<br>
of formula I as defined above and at least one MBi.<br>
A method of making such a composition is also provided which<br>
comprises bringing the compound of formuia i and the MBi as defined<br>
above into association with at ieast one carrier, it is also envisaged that<br>
different isomers or mixtures of isomers of the compound of formula I and/or<br>
the MBI may have different levels or spectra of activity and thus<br>
compositions may comprise individual isomers or mixtures of isomers.<br>
A composition according to the invention preferably contains from<br>
0.1% to 99.9%, preferably 0.2 to 80 % by weight (w/w) of active Ingredients.<br>
A carrier in a composition according to the invention is any material<br>
with which the active ingredient is formulated to facilitate application to the<br>
locus to be treated, which may for example be a plant, seed, foliage, soil, or<br>
into the water where the plant grows, or to the roots, or to facilitate storage,<br>
transport or handling. A carrier may be a solid or a liquid, including material<br>
which is normally a gas but which has been compressed to form a liquid.<br>
The compositions may be manufactured into, e.g., emulsion or<br>
emulsifiable concentrates, solutions, oil in water emulsions, wettable<br>
powders, soluble powders, suspension concentrates, solutions, dusts,<br>
granules, water dispersible granules, tablets, aerosols, micro-capsules, gels<br>
and other formulation types by well-established procedures. These<br>
procedures include intensive mixing and/or milling of the active ingredients<br>
with other substances, such as fillers, solvents, solid carriers, surface active<br>
compounds (surfactants), and optionally solid and/or liquid auxilaries and/or<br>
adjuvants. The form of application such as spraying, atomizing, dispersing<br>
or pouring may be chosen like the compositions according to the desired<br>
objectives and the given circumstances.<br>
Solvents may be aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. Solvesso® 200,<br>
substituted naphthalenes, phthalic acid esters, such as dibutyl or dioctyl<br>
phthalate, aliphatic hydrocarbons, e.g. cyclohexane or paraffins, alcohols<br>
and glycols as well as their ethers and esters, e.g. ethanol, ethyleneglycol<br>
mono- and dimethyl ether, ketones such as cyclohexanone, strongly polar<br>
solvents such as N-methyI-2-pyrrolidone, or g-butyrolactone. higher alkyl<br>
pyrrolidones, e.g. n-octytpyrrolidone or cyclohexylpyrrolidone, epoxidized<br>
plant oil esters, e.g. methylated coconut or soybean oil ester and water.<br>
Mixtures of different liquids are often suitable.<br>
Solid carriers, which may be used for dusts, wettable powders, water<br>
dispersible granules, or granules, may be mineral fillers, such as calcite,<br>
talc, kaolin, montmorillonite or attapulgite or others. The physical properties<br>
may be improved by addition of highly dispersed silica gel or polymers.<br>
Carriers for granules may be porous material, e.g. pumice, kaolin, sepiolite,<br>
bentonrte; non-sorptive carriers may be calcite or sand or others.<br>
Additionally, a multitude of pre-granulated inorganic or organic materials<br>
may be used, such as dolomite or crushed plant residues.<br>
Pesticidal compositions are often formulated and transported in a<br>
concentrated form which is subsequently diluted by the user before<br>
application. The presence of small amounts of a carrier which is a<br>
surfactant facilitates this process of dilution. Thus, preferably at least one<br>
carrier in a composition according to the invention is a surfactant. For<br>
example, the composition may contain at two or more carriers, at least one<br>
of which is a surfactant.<br>
Surfactants may be nonionic, anionic, cationic or zwitterionic<br>
substances with good dispersing, emulsifying and wetting properties<br>
depending on the nature of the compound according to general formula I to<br>
be formulated. Surfactants may also mean mixtures of individual<br>
surfactants.<br>
Wettable powders of this invention suitably will contain 5 to 90% w/w<br>
of active ingredient and, in addition to a solid inert carrier, 3 to10% w/w of<br>
dispersing and wetting agents and, where necessary, 0 to 10% w/w of<br>
stabilizer(s) and/or other additives such as penetrants or stickers. Dusts<br>
may be formulated as a dust concentrate having a similar composition to<br>
that of a wettable powder but without a dispersant, and may be diluted in<br>
the field with further solid carrier to give a composition usually containing<br>
0.5 to 10% w/w of active ingredient Water dispersible granules and<br>
granules may have a size between 0.15 mm and 2.0 mm and may be<br>
manufactured by a variety of techniques. Generally, these granules will<br>
contain 0.5 to 90% w/w active ingredient and 0 to 20% w/w of additives<br>
such as stabilizer, surfactants, slow release modifiers and binding agents.<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates may contain, in addition to a solvent or a mixture<br>
of solvents, 1 to 80% w/v active ingredient, 2 to 20% w/v emulsifiers and 0<br>
to 20% w/v of other additives such as stabilizers, penetrants and corrosion<br>
inhibitors. Suspension concentrates are suitably milled so as to obtain a<br>
stable, non-sedimenting. flowable product and typically contain 5 to 75%<br>
w/v active ingredient. 0.5 to 15% w/v of dispersing agents, 0.1 to 10% w/v<br>
of suspending agents such as protective colloids and thixotropic agents, 0<br>
to 10% w/v of other additives such as defoamers. corrosion inhibitors,<br>
stabilizers, penetrants and stickers, and water or an organic liquid in which<br>
the active ingredient is substantially insoluble; certain organic solids or<br>
inorganic salts may be dissolved in the formulation to assist in preventing<br>
sedimentation and crystalization or as antifreeze agents.<br>
Aqueous dispersions and emulsions, for example compositions<br>
obtained by diluting the formulated product according to the invention with<br>
water, also lie within the scope of the invention.<br>
Of particular interest in enhancing the duration of the protective activity<br>
of the compounds of this invention is the use of a carrier which will provide<br>
slow release of the pesticidal compounds into the environment of a plant<br>
which is to be protected.<br>
The biological activity of the active ingredient can also be increased by<br>
including an adjuvant in the spray dilution. An adjuvant is defined here as a<br>
substance which can increase the biological activity of an active ingredient<br>
but is not itself significantly biologically active. The adjuvant can either be<br>
included in the formulation as a coformulant or carrier, or can be added to<br>
the spray tank together with the formulation containing the active ingredient.<br>
As a commodity, the compositions may preferably be in a<br>
concentrated form whereas the end user generally employs diluted<br>
compositions. The compositions may be diluted to a concentration down to<br>
0.001% of active ingredient. The doses usually are in the range from 0.01 to<br>
10 kg a.i./ha.<br>
Examples of formulations which can be used according to the<br>
invention are:<br>
1)   Product commercially available from Wrtco<br>
 2)   Product commercially available from BASF AG, Germany<br>
3) Product commercially available from Rhoneca-Poulenc<br>
4) Product commercially available from Zeneca<br>
The formulation SC-E comprising Propionamide E is in-tank mixed<br>
with any of the other formulations SC-A. SC-B, SC-D, DC-A or DC-B which<br>
comprise the Azolopyrimidines A. B or D.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the active ingredients are added to the<br>
tank mix together, each as a solo formulation.<br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to a kit for the preparation of<br>
a spray mixture consisting of two separate formulations:<br>
(i) a formulation which comprises at least one azolopyrimidine of formula I.<br>
in particular Azolopyrimidines A, B, C or D, conventional adjuvants and<br>
carriers;<br>
(ii) a formulation which comprises at least one MBI, preferably a<br>
phenoxyamide of formula II, in particular Propionamide E or F,<br>
conventional adjuvants and earners.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the kit includes two bottles with<br>
dispensing means which allow easy and correct addition of the formulations<br>
(i) and (ii) to the tank mix.<br>
The formulation SC-A/E comprising Azolopyrimidine A and<br>
Propionamide E can be used directly for preparing the tank mix according<br>
to the present invention.<br>
A composition according to the invention preferably contains from<br>
0.5% to 95% by weight of active ingredients.<br>
The compositions of this invention may be diluted down to a<br>
concentration of 0.0001% of active ingredients.<br>
The compositions of this invention can be applied to the plants or<br>
their environment simultaneous with or in succession with other active<br>
substances. These other active substances can be either fertilizers, agents<br>
which donate trace elements or other preparations which influence plant<br>
growth. However, they can also be selective herbicides, insecticides,<br>
fungicides, bactericides, nematiddes, algiddes, molluscicides, rodenticides,<br>
virucides, compounds inducing resistance into plants, biological control<br>
agents such as viruses, bacteria, nematodes, fungi and other<br>
microorganisms, repellents of birds and animals, and plant growth<br>
regulators, or mixtures of several of these preparations, if appropriate<br>
together with other carrier substances conventionally used in the art of<br>
formulation, surfactants or other additives which promote application.<br>

The present invention is of wide applicability in the protection of crop<br>
and ornamental plants against fungal attack. Preferred crop is rice and in<br>
particular paddy-rice. The duration of the protection is normally dependent<br>
on the individual compound selected, and also a variety of external factors,<br>
such as climate, whose impact is normally mitigated by the use of a suitable<br>
formulation.<br>
The following examples further illustrate the present invention. It<br>
shouid be understood, however, that the invention is not limited solely to<br>
the particular examples given below<br>
EXAMPLES:<br>
For the field study formulated Azolopyrimidine A, B or D (100 g/| DC-A or<br>
DC-B; 100 g/I SC-D) and formulated Propionamlde E (200 g/l SC-E) were<br>
used.<br>
The field tests of the method of the present invention were conducted on<br>
rice fields in the Philipines, in Brazil and Japan.<br>
Materials and application method:<br>
Rice seed of variety "IR-50" was sown in a sand/garden soil in 0.07 sq.m.<br>
(0.23x0.3m) plastic boxes. Fourteen days later, in the Z14/20 growth stage,<br>
the plants were sprayed with the fungicidal compounds for the first time.<br>
The formulated compounds were weighed out and diluted with water.<br>
Equivalents of 100, 200 and 400 g active ingredients per ha were applied<br>
with a hand hold atomizer using 1000 I spray volume per ha. The doses of<br>
the single compounds and of the mixtures are given in the tables of results<br>
below. There were three replicated boxes per treatment. The spraying was<br>
repeated 7 days after the first application using the same<br>
compounds/compound mixtures at the same dose rates and spray<br>
volurne/ha.<br>
Evaluation of the disease:<br>
Assessments of the rice blast disease and the rice sheath blight disease<br>
took place 14 days after the first application (= 7 days after the second<br>
application) of the compounds. Percent leaf area infected was evaluated<br>
The efficacy of the compounds/compounds mixtures to control the diseases<br>
was calculated by using the formula:<br>
Determination of synergy:<br>
Synergy was calculated using the % disease control values of specific<br>
treatments for the two COLBY formula given hereinabove<br>
Example 1 Control of rice blast caused by Pyricularia oryzae<br>
Infection with Pyricularia oryzae:<br>
Three hours after the first compound application (when the plants were dry)<br>
an in-vitro grown conidial suspension of Pyricufaria oryzae was inoculated<br>
onto the foliar surfaces of the rice plants using a hand held atomizer. The<br>
conidial concentration was about 1 million per ml. Plants were then placed<br>
into a moist chamber for 24 h at 24-26 degree C with about 100% relative<br>
humidity. The plants were then moved outdoors until the rice blast disease<br>
could be evaluated.<br>
The formulations applied, the dosage rates of the active ingredients applied<br>
(expressed in grams of active ingredient per hectare), the results expressed<br>
as efficacy of disease control and the expected efficacies calculated<br>
according to Colby"s formula are set forth below in table I.<br>
Table I           Percent rice blast control of DC-A and DC-B and SC-E when<br>
applied alone or in mixture as found in the experiment and as<br>
expected using COLBVs formula<br>
Example 2 Control of Rhizoctonia solani<br>
Infection with Rhizoctonia solani:<br>
Three hours after the second application of the compounds/compounds<br>
mixtures, the plants were inoculated with Rhizoctonia solani (gown in rice<br>
grain-hull medium) by evenly sprinkling the inoculum on the soil surface at<br>
the basis of the plants. Plants were then placed into a moist chamber for 24<br>
h. After that the plants were moved outdoors until the rice sheath blight<br>
disease could be evaluated.<br>
The formulation applied, the dose rates of the active ingredients applied<br>
(expressed in grams of active ingredient per hectare), the results expressed<br>
as efficacy of disease control and the expected efficacies calculated<br>
according to Colby"s formula are set forth below in table II.<br>
Disease symptoms (rice blast and rice sheath blight) were assessed 7 days<br>
days after the second application (DAT) of the products.<br>
Table II          Percent rice sheath blight control of DC-A and DOB and SC-<br>
E when applied atone or in mixture as found in the experiment<br>
and as expected using COLBVs formula:<br>
Example 3 Control of Pyricularia oryzae<br>
For another experiment, established in the field in Japan paddy-rice plants<br>
of the variety "Koshihikari" were grown up in nursery boxes, and were<br>
transplanted to the field in plots of 10 sqm. 46 and 53 days after<br>
transplanting, the plants were sprayed with the formulations SC-A and SC-<br>
E and a in-tank mixture of these formulations after dilution in water and<br>
applying the equivalent of 1 liter per plot with a spraying equipment. The<br>
compound A was formulated as a 100 g/l SC.<br>
Each treatment was applied in three plots (3 replicates). There were also<br>
untreated plots. 15 days after the second treatment 17 % of the leaf area of<br>
the untreated rice plants (controls) were infected with the rice blast disease.<br>
The disease level (% infected leaf area) was also assessed in the treated<br>
plants, and the efficacy (in %) of the treatment was measured. The effects<br>
of mixtures according to the invention and the solo compounds are given in<br>
Table III.<br>
Table III Percent rice blast control of SC-A and SC-E when applied<br>
alone or in mixture as found in the experiment and as<br>
expected using COLBY"S formula:<br>
Example 4 Control of Pyricularia oryzae<br>
Rice variety lAC-165 was direct seeded in field plots in Brazil. Individual<br>
field plots were 9m2 and each treatment was replicated 3 times. Overhead<br>
irrigation was used to ensure uniform germination and disease development<br>
but an artificial inoculation was not necessary as sufficient disease<br>
established itself naturally.<br>
Two applications of each treatment were made, 7 days apart and in a water<br>
volume of 1000I/ha. A visual assessment of disease control was made 14<br>
days after the first application.<br>
The effects of mixtures according to the invention (SC-D + SC-E) and the<br>
solo compounds are given in Table fV.<br>
Table IV Percent rice blast control of SC-D and SC-C when applied<br>
alone or in mixture as found in the experiment and as<br>
expected using COLBY"s formula<br>
