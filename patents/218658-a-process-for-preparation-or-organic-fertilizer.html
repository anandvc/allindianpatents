				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of organic fertilizer. FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The invention particularly relates to a process for the preparation of organic fertilizer rich in nitrogen and minerals. More particularly, the invention relates to a process for the preparation of fertilizer from plants containing sesquiterpene lactones exemplified by parthenin. Specifically the invention relates to a process for the preparation of organic fertilizer from plants belonging to family Compositae (Asteraceae) illustrated by chrysanthemum, aster, sunflower and parthenium preferably all species of Parthenium in general and Parthenium hysterophorus L. in particular, which is an obnoxious weed. Yet more particularly, the invention relates to a process for the preparation of organic fertilizer involving bioworkers selected from a group of organisms belonging to Phylum Annelida, which are epigeic in nature. Still more particularly the invention relates to a process for the preparation of organic fertilizer involving conversion of recalcitrant, hazardous, contact allergens, sesquiterpene lactones such as parthenin through decomposition of the plants containing the said component to useful valuable fertilizer adopting eco-friendly methods for solid waste management. Further, the invention relates to a process that is capable of handling large volume of waste. Additionally, the process as described is simple, cost effective, easy to operate, free from foul smell, environment friendly, does not require any heavy infrastructure or stringent process conditions and capable of industrial application. Thus, the process relates to recycling and reuse of solid waste material and to resolve impairment of ecosystem.<br><br>
BACK GROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Parthenium hysterophorus is native of Tropical America and West Indies. It occurs in USA, Mexico, Argentina, Uruguay, Trinidad, Guyana, Jamaica, West Indies, South Africa, Mauritius, North Viet-nam and India. Parthenium belongs to Asteraceae family and normally grows to a height of about 1 to 1.5m. The plant flowers in about a month after germination and keeps growing throughout the year under optimum conditions. The seeds are easily carried away by wind, which results in invading wastelands and croplands. Prolific seeding habit of Parthenium, non-dormancy and extreme light-weight of its seeds armed with pappus are some of the characteristics which help its extensive spread and establishment. Parthenium produces enormous quantity of pollen, which is carried away easily and settles on vegetative parts. Further, these pollen grains inhibit fruit set in tomato, brinjal, beans etc. thereby reducing yield up to 40 per cent.<br>
Parthenium causes severe human and animal health problems. Sesquiterpene lactones derived from plants of the family Asteraceae are responsible for contact dermatitis, rhinitis and asthma in humans as well as animals. Additionally these plants contain toxic phenolic components.<br>
The obnoxious composite plants containing parthenin and other toxic components need to be eradicated for protection of environment and health of humans and animals. Uprooting and burning the plants before flowering is set in is one of the easiest ways to eradicate the plant. Mealy bug (Ferris virgata), insect lantana bug<br><br>
(Orthezia insignis), beetle (Zygogramma bicolorata) are also used to control the weed. Certain chemical herbicides can be employed for killing the weeds. However, due to growing awareness of environmental pollution (herbicide residue in ground water and soil) arising through the use of chemical herbicides and promotion of organic fanning, the use of herbicides for eradication of these weeds gets restricted. The fact that Government of India desires eradication of this invasive exotic noxious weed and allocates funds for this purpose indicates the severity of the problem and urgent need for the solution. Thus, there is an imperative need to develop a process that is simple economical and coverts this obnoxious weed to useful product like bio-fertilizer while maintaining environmental standards. It also helps in meeting the societal needs pertaining to health aspects.<br>
To best of knowledge there is no prior information pertaining to a process for converting plants containing sesquiterpene lactones exemplified by parthenin to useful organic fertilizer using annelids as described herein after.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>

Yet other object of the present invention is to provide a process that is simple, cost<br>
effective, easy to operate, free from foul smell, environment friendly, does not<br>
require any heavy infrastructure or stringent process conditions and capable of<br>
industrial application.<br>
Thus, invention provides a process, which recycles and reuse of solid waste material<br>
and convert the same to useful fertilizer resolving impairment of ecosystem.<br>
The novelty of the invention resides in using annelids to convert obnoxious weeds, containing sesquiterpene lactones exemplified by parthenin as main hazardous component in addition to toxic phenolics, when supplemented with dung to bio-<br><br>
fertilizer using epigeic species of annelids in predominantly aerobic atmosphere while maintaining the environment clean and free from odor.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The working of the invention is further described herein after in detail. The process may be divided in to six steps viz. solid state reactor and loading with the starting material, decomposing the said material by engaging the bio-workers, maintaining humidity and aerobic conditions and harvesting the fertilizer thus obtained. Solid state reactor and loading: The reactor is loaded with a mixture of cattle-dung slurry and chopped plants containing Parthenin exemplified without restriction to chrysanthemum, sunflower, aster, parthenium preferably parthenium sp. more preferably Parthenium hysterophorus L. commonly known as Gazar Ghas (2-3 cm) in ratios ranging from 10:1 to 10:3 with a preferred ratio of 10:2, herein after termed as matrix, for initiating the process. The chopped plant material is wetted with dung slurry packed in a container of dimensions preferably of 6 feet x 3 feet xl.5 feet (length x breadth x height). The container has a sloping base and suitable outlets for<br><br>
drainage. It also has several numbers of holes on all sides to permit adequate aeration of the matrix. A layer of gravel and sand (1:1), about 3 cm thick is given between drainage holes and the matrix to ensure smooth and uninterrupted drainage of water. Material for the container can be wood, bamboo, plastic, or any other. Alternatively, the matrix can simply be piled on a flat open surface, in the dimensions described above. The dimensions are however by no means limiting and deviation from the same will in no way limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Decomposition of the matrix: The matrix is inoculated with bio-workers preferably epigeic species of annelids by inoculating the said organisms by any known methods. The annelids may be exemplified with no restriction to Eisenia foetida, Perionyx excavatus, Lumbricus rubellus, L.terrestris, Dichogaster bolaui, Ramiella sundargharanis, Eudrillus eugeniae, Lampito maurtiti, Drawida willsi, Octochaetona serrata, O.surensis and O.thurstoni preferably Eisenia foetida commonly known as earth worm. The organism is inoculated into the matrix at concentrations ranging from 5-20%, with a preferred concentration of 10% more preferably 2%w/w of the matrix.<br>
Maintenance of humidity: After inoculation, sprinkling of water is carried out weekly to ensure an optimal humidity of around 75-85%. The process may be carried out at room temperature of around 20-25 degree Celsius. Matrix may preferably be kept away from being exposed to direct sunlight. It may preferably be kept in diffused light.<br><br>
Maintaining aerobic conditions: Turning of the matrix is advisable as it ensures adequate entry of air into the matrix, which in turn speeds up the decomposition process. The turning may be done at an interval of every five or seven days. Harvesting: At the end when the material is completely degraded into a fine, black powdery organic fertilizer, which takes about 40 -45 days, harvesting of the same is carried out using a fine sieve and shaking, so that the organic fertilizer passed down the pores of the sieve while the living organisms are retained on the sieve and can be used for inoculation again. Alternatively, harvesting can also be carried out by stoppage of watering so that the organisms move down and the organic fertilizer is collected from the top.<br>
The fertilizer thus obtained is likely to be contaminated with the seeds. It is suggested that the germination potential of these seeds may be terminated adopting light and dark treatment. The organic fertilizer is dampened with water and packed in a transparent polythene bag. Mouth of the bag is closed with a string, after leaving a little air gap. Bag is kept in diffused light (shade), at a temperature of 28- 38° C for a week. Seeds germinate. Thereafter, bag is moved to complete darkness and mouth is opened. Seedlings die in absence of light, in about a week. Process is repeated thrice or till no further germination of the seeds is seen.<br>
Drying and packaging: The final preparation is dried at a temperature of 40°C overnight or 60°C for five hours. Alternatively, product can also be dried by exposure to sunlight. After drying, product is packed in polythene bags and sealed.<br><br>
The invention is further illustrated with the following example. The example is merely illustrative and is not to be construed as a limitation of the invention. One skilled in the art will be able to make such variations, substitutions and changes in the ingredients and parameters as may seem desirable. Though the example is illustrated with human hair cow dung and E.foetida, it can be extended to the other described and claimed components.<br>
Example 1:<br>
The plant was uprooted, irrespective of the stage of growth, chopped into 2-3 cm pieces and weighed. Ten kilograms of the plant material was wetted with water and mixed with 2 kg of cattle-dung slurry. It was piled in a box of dimensions 3 feet x 2 feet x 1 feet (length x breadth x depth), having adequate number of holes along the sides for aeration and at base for drainage of excess water. The matrix was inoculated with the living organism, Eisenia foetida @ 10% wet weight of the matrix, exposed to temperature of 25°C and regularly watered to ensure an optimal humidity of 75-85%. Matrix was protected from rain and sunrays and kept in diffused light. Turning of the matrix was carried out at intervals of about ten days to ensure aeration, as process is essentially aerobic. At end of 40-45 days, partial completion of the process was marked by disappearance of the plant material and appearance of a black, crumbly material. The crumbly material was dampened, packed into transparent poly-bags, which were then closed at the mouth leaving slight air gap. Thereafter, bags were placed in diffused light. Contaminating seeds of<br><br>
Parthenium hysterophorus or other weeds/plants in the crumbly material germinated and were visible through bags. Bags were then placed in darkness, resulting in killing of seedlings. Process was repeated 2-3 times, till no further seed-germination was observed. The crumbly material was dried at 45°C overnight, packed in bags and represented the final product or organic fertilizer. It was tested for performance of crop plants with respect to their seed germination, seed vigor, seedling growth in terms of extension growth and biomass, chlorophyll content and the yield. It was found to have positive effect on all the parameters of the crop plants tested.<br>
ADVANTAGES:<br>
