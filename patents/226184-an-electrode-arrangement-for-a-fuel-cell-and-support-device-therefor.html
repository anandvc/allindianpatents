				<td>AN ELECTRODE ARRANGEMENT FOR A FUEL CELL<br>
AND SUPPORT DEVICE THEREFOR<br>
Description<br>
The Invention relates to an electrode arrangement for a fuel cell and a<br>
support device therefor.<br>
It is known from WO 00/54358 to connect electrodes for fuel cells in<br>
parallel or in series. For example, it is proposed therein to electrically connect to<br>
one another the anode, which is arranged at a free end of an electrode of coaxial<br>
design, to that surface of a further, identical electrode which is designed as a<br>
cathode, to provide a series connection.<br>
Furthermore, the design of fuel cell modules is explained, in which a<br>
multiplicity of individual electrodes are arranged in each case in a plane in a<br>
frame and are connected in a cascade. In this case, those surfaces of the<br>
individual electrodes which are designed as a cathode are directly in contact and<br>
the anodes of the individual electrodes are connected to one another on an end<br>
side of the module.<br>
Individual modules of this type may, in turn, be connected in a cascade<br>
and/or in series.<br>
The comparatively complex design of the known modules and the<br>
necessity of electrically insulating individual modules from one another in a<br>
series connection represent a considerable technical effort. In particular, the<br>
operational reliability of a fuel cell having modules of this type, in particular<br>
modules which are connected in series, is also questionable, since, if the single,<br>
electrical connection between the modules is interrupted, the entire fuel cell no<br>
longer functions.<br><br>
Against this technical background, the invention has the object of<br>
providing an electrode arrangement for a fuel cell, which arrangement has a<br>
simple structural design, but is extremely efficient and the geometry of which can<br>
be designed in a simple manner and which can have, in particular, a circular<br>
cross section.<br>
The solution to this technical problem is focused on an electrode<br>
arrangement for a fuel cell, which arrangement has a plurality of electrode<br>
bundles which in each case comprise a plurality of electrodes connected in<br>
parallel, are connected in series, are gathered together in each case on the end<br>
side and are connected electrically.<br>
An electrode arrangement of this type expediently requires electrodes<br>
whose cathode or anode can be tapped of on the end side. As a consequence, it<br>
is possible to connect the anodes or cathodes of the electrodes of an electrode<br>
bundle electrically to one another on the end side in order thereby to obtain a<br>
cascade connection of a multiplicity of electrodes. As a consequence, the failure<br>
of one electrode, possibly even a plurality of electrodes, of an electrode bundle<br>
will have hardly any effect on its functioning capability.<br>
A plurality of electrode bundles of this type, preferably of identical design,<br>
are further connected in series, for which purpose electrode bundles rotated<br>
through 180° are arranged in an alternating manner.<br>
The electrodes are gathered together on the end side, this providing<br>
sufficient stability overall. It is preferably conceivable here for the ends of the<br>
electrodes forming an electrode bundle to be taken hold of together, it also being<br>
possible for the electrical connection to be undertaken by the holder. In<br>
particular, these holders of the electrode bundles connected in series is<br>
furthermore designed to be mechanically common, but separated electrically<br>
from one another.<br><br>
This structural design permits electrode arrangements of virtually any<br>
desired geometry, in particular even of circular ring-shaped cross section.<br>
In one structural refinement, provision is made for the electrodes to be<br>
spaced apart from one another. This measure ensures that, for example,<br>
combustion gas, flow readily against each individual electrode or flows readily<br>
through the electrode arrangement.<br>
In one structural refinement, provision may furthermore be made for<br>
electrode bundles to be held in each case on the end side in electrically<br>
conductive sectors, which are insulated from one another, of a common head<br>
plate. The electrodes are therefore held on the end side and connected<br>
electrically to one another in a simple manner. In this case, the sectors are<br>
preferably designed as sectors of a circle, with which a circular ting-shaped cross<br>
section of the electrode arrangement can be formed.<br>
In order to connect electrode bundles in series, provision is preferably<br>
made for this purpose for two electrode bundles arranged with opposing poles to<br>
be connected in an electrically conductive manner and, in particular, also<br>
(lathered together in one sector. In this connection, it may be expedient, if the<br>
electrode bundles are in each case held on the end side together in a head<br>
plate, to arrange the sectors rotated relative to one another with respect respect<br>
to a central axis.<br>
In this connection, provision is furthermore generally made for a first head<br>
plate to have n sectors and for a second head plate to have n + 1 sectors, n<br>
representing a whole number. The second head plate will therefore have the<br>
plus and the minus pole of the electrode arrangement, in particular in sectors<br>
lying next to one another.<br>
The individual sectors may be separated from one another, for example,<br>
by nsulating layers. However, it is preferred for non-conductive webs to separate<br><br>
the sectors electrically from one another. In this case, in addition to the function<br>
of connecting the sectors but insulating them electrically from one another, the<br>
webs also have a supporting function, in particular if a common head plate is<br>
formed. It is then furthermore appropriate also to fix the electrode arrangement in<br>
a fuel cell to these non-conductive webs, for example.<br>
In one preferred refinement, provision is made for the webs to be held at<br>
one end in a center in the manner of spokes to form a star. The sectors are<br>
therefore designed in a simple manner as sectors of a circle. If in particular in a<br>
further refinement, provision is made for the free ends of the webs of a star to be<br>
enclosed by a ring, the production of the electrode arrangement according to the<br>
invention is made possible in a particular simple manner. This is because, after<br>
the corresponding ends of the electrode bundles are inserted into the sectors,<br>
these ends can be sealed in a simple manner, since the regions which are to be<br>
sealed are already predetermined in terms of shape without needing further<br>
molds or the like.<br>
Provision may be made for the ring to be extended axially in the manner<br>
of a sleeve until it overlaps the entire axial extent of the electrode arrangement.<br>
A "housing" can thus be formed and/or fastening possibilities within a fuel cell<br>
can be made available.<br>
In another structural refinement, provision is made for the centers of<br>
opposite head plates to be connected by central rod, in particular for the centers<br>
of two stars to be connected to each other by a central rod of this type. An exact<br>
positioning of the individual electrode bundles is therefore predetermined. Also, if<br>
subjected to an axial load, a transmission of force does not take place via the<br>
electrodes themselves, but rather this will take place via the central rod. High<br>
mechanical stability is therefore ensured.<br>
Provision may be made for the electrodes to be arranged extending<br>
rectilinearly and in parallel. A simple structural design is therefore ensured.<br><br>
However, as an alternative, provision may be made for the electrodes to be<br>
arranged coiled. In consequence, in comparison to electrodes arranged<br>
rectilinearly, with the electrode arrangement having the same axial extent, a<br>
higher voltage is produced owing to the coiled electrodes which are of longer<br>
design. A greater packing density is therefore achieved.<br>
In one variant of the electrode arrangement according to the invention, the<br>
design of an individual electrode is simplified, and a common external electrode<br>
is provided for an electrode bundle, at which a tap can be led off in a simple<br>
manner to provide a voltage potential counter to the enclosed electrode bundle.<br>
In this case, it has proven expedient if the common external electrode<br>
encloses, in cross section, a sector of a circle, in particular if a plurality of<br>
external electrodes arranged lying next to one another together are arranged<br>
forming a circle. An extremely compact structural form can therefore be<br>
achieved, and a parallel connection is made possible in a simple manner by<br>
electrically connecting the external electrodes. It is preferred, however, for the<br>
opposite surfaces of external electrodes lying next to one another to be arranged<br>
separated electrically from one another, so that a cascade circuit is also made<br>
possible in the manner explained at the beginning. The sectors of a circle of two<br>
external electrodes lying next to each other can then correspond to an<br>
electrically conductive sector of a head plate.<br>
If an electrode arrangement of this type is provided with an external<br>
electrode, further electrodes can be provided spaced apart radially and also<br>
parallel to said arrangement, it also being possible, in particular, for the<br>
electrodes to have different axial extents.<br>
In particular for the electrode arrangement according to the invention<br>
which was described at the beginning, it has proven expedient to provide a<br>
support device in which provision is made for the centers of two stars of webs<br>
held in the manner of spokes to be connected by a central part. A support device<br><br>
of this type makes it possible to exactly predetermine the positioning of electrode<br>
bundles which, moreover, are connected in a mechanically stable manner to the<br>
support device. In this case, it is expedient if the number of webs of the stars<br>
differs by one. A secure electrical connection to the star having one web more is<br>
therefore made possible in a simple manner.<br>
In one preferred refinement, the support is manufactured integrally from<br>
an electrically insulating material, for example from a plastic.<br>
In order to make it possible to seal in the free ends of the electrodes or<br>
electrode bundles, provision may furthermore be made to enclose the free ends<br>
of the webs of a star with a ring. This ring will then generally mark the outer ring<br>
of a head plate. If appropriate, a ring of this type may also be extended axially in<br>
the manner of a sleeve.<br>
Accordingly, the present mention provides an electrode arrangement for a<br>
fuel cell having two end sides and comprising a plurality of electrode bundles<br>
connected in series, each of said plural electrode bundles having a plurality of<br>
olectrodes connected in parallel, each of said plural electrodes having first and<br>
second ends, wherein said first ends of said plurality of electrodes in each<br>
respective one of said plural electrode bundles are gathered together one one of<br>
the end sides and connected electrically and said second ends of said plurality of<br>
electrodes in each respective one of said plural electrode bundles are gathered<br>
together on the other one of the end sides and connected electrically; a first<br>
head plate on said one of said end sides having a plurality of electrically<br>
conductive sectors which are insulated from one another, wherein each of said<br>
electrode bundles are held on said one of said end sides by said electrically<br>
conductive sectors, wherein opposing poles of two of said plural electrode<br>
bundles are connected in an electrically conductive manner by one sector of said<br>
plural electrically conductive sectors, thereby creating a series connection of said<br>
two of said plural electrode bundles; and a second head plate on the other of<br>
said side ends, wherein said first head plate has n sectors and said second head<br><br>
plate has n+1 sectors, where n represents a whole number.<br>
The present invention also provides a support device for an electrode<br>
arrangement comprising a plurality of electrode bundles connected in series,<br>
each of said plural electrode bundles having a plurality of electrodes connected<br>
in parallel, each of said plural electrodes having first and second ends, said<br>
support device comprising: a first head end having webs connected at a center<br>
position and extending radially from said center, said webs defining sectors in<br>
which the first ends of the bundles of electrodes are receivable; a second head<br>
end having webs connected at a center position and extending radially from said<br>
center, said webs defining sectors in which the second ends of the bundles of<br>
electrodes are receivable, wherein said first head end has n webs and said<br>
second head has n+1 webs, where n represents a whole number; and a central<br>
rod connected between the said centers of said first and second head ends, said<br>
first and second head ends being arranged on said central rod such that a<br>
projection of each sector on said first head end parallel to said central rod covers<br>
portions of two sectors on second head end, whereby electrode bundles<br>
connected in one sector on said first head end are connectable to two different<br>
sectors on said second head end.<br>
The invention will be explained in greater detail with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings, in which exemplary embodiments are illustrated merely<br>
schematically. In the drawings :<br>
Figure 1 shows an isometric illustration of an electrode arrangement<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows a view of the end side according to the arrow II in figure 1,<br>
Figure 3 shows a support device according to the invention, and<br>
Figure 4 shows, in a cross section, a further exemplary embodiment of an<br><br>
electrode arrangement.<br>
Figure 1 shows an electrode arrangement according to the invention for a<br>
fuel cell with, by way of example, six electrode bundles 1 to 6 which consist, in<br>
turn, by way of example, of six individual electrodes 7 which are connected in<br>
parallel.<br>
In contrast, the electrode bundles 1 to 6 themselves are connected in<br>
series.<br>
In particular, tubular composites which have a coaxial design and the plus<br>
and minus pole of which can be tapped off on the end side are suitable as<br>
electrodes. The electrochemical reaction, for example, between a combustion<br>
gas and an oxidant generally takes place in the case of electrodes 7 of this type<br>
via the coaxial structure thereof, the design of the structure being dependent on<br>
whether the combustion gas, for example, flows through or against the<br>
electrodes 7.<br>
In order, in particular, to ensure that the flow passes against each<br>
electrodes 7, the electrodes 7 the electrodes 7 are spaced apart from one<br>
another.<br>
The electrodes 7 or the electrode bundles 1 to 6 are held on the end side<br>
in head plates 8, 9 and also are connected electrically in these head plates 8, 9.<br>
For this purpose, the head plates 8, 9 are divided into sectors of an<br>
electrically conductive material, here into sectors of a circle 10 to 12 of the head<br>
plate 8 and 13 to 16 of the head plate 9, said sectors being separated electrically<br>
from one another by webs 17 to 19 and webs 20 to 23 of a non-conductive<br>
material.<br>
The first head plate 8 has just three sectors 10 to 12, while the second<br><br>
head plate 9 has one sector more, so that the minus pole 24 and the plus pole<br>
25 of the electrode arrangement, for example, can be tapped off there. In<br>
general terms this means that the first head plate 8 has a number of n sectors<br>
and the second head plate 9 has a number of n+1 sectors, n representing a<br>
whole number.<br>
The first electrode bundle 1 with electrodes 7 arranged rectilinearly and in<br>
parallel extends between the sector 13 having the minus pole 24 of the head<br>
plate 9 and the sector 10 of the first head plate 8 and is held there in the sector<br>
10, for example, for example in a conductive sealing compound, as a result of<br>
which the cathodes of the electrodes 7 of the electrode bundle 1 are also<br>
connected conductively to one another and thus their parallel connection is<br>
ensured there. These cathodes of the first electrode bundle 1 are characterized<br>
in the sector 10 by the plus sign.<br>
In the same manner, the anodes the electrode bundle 2 are held in the<br>
electrically conductive sector 10 and are connected in an electrically conductive<br>
manner in a parallel circuit. The anodes are illustrated by the minus sign.<br>
The cathodes of the electrode bundle 2 are then connected in parallel in<br>
the same manner in the sector 14 of the head plate 9 and are connected in an<br>
electrically conductive manner to the anodes, which are likewise connected in<br>
parallel, of the electrode bundle 3 which has, at the other end, in the head plate<br>
8 cathodes which are connected in parallel in the sector 11.<br>
In the sector 11, the electrode bundle 4 is, in turn, held on the end side on<br>
the anode side and is also electrically connected together. The parallel<br>
connection of the electrode bundle 4 on the cathode side takes place in the<br>
sector 15 of the head plate 9, in which the anodes of the electrode bundle 5 are<br>
furthermore connected in parallel. The cathodes of the electrode bundle 5 are<br>
gathered and connected in the sector 12, together with the anodes of the<br>
electrodes of the electrode bundle 6. Its cathodes which are gathered and<br><br>
connected electrically in the sector 16 of the head plate 9 are designed as plus<br>
pole 25.<br>
The six electrode bundles 1 to 6 with in each case six electrodes<br>
connected in parallel are therefore themselves connected in series by in each<br>
case two electrode bundles, which are arranged with opposing poles, being<br>
electrically conductively connected in the sectors 10 to 12 and 14 and 15, with<br>
the exception of the sectors 13 and 16, between which the voltage output from<br>
the fuel cell or from the electrode arrangement can be tapped off at the poles 24,<br>
25.<br>
The webs 17 to 19 and 20 to 23 which electrically separate the sectors 10<br>
to 12 and 13 to 16, respectively, and the rings 26, 27 which respectively radially<br>
enclose the head plates 8 and 9 can be part of a support device 28, of the<br>
illustration which is not to scale according to figure 3.<br>
In figure 3, in which the assignment of the reference numbers have been<br>
undertaken in accordance with figure 1, it can be seen that the webs 17 to 19 are<br>
held at one end in a center 29 in the manner of spokes to form a star 30. The<br>
free, radially outer ends of the webs 17 to 19 are enclosed by a ring 26. This<br>
measure provides a "casting mold" in which the ends of the electrode bundles 1<br>
to 6 are held by, for example, an electrically conductive casting resin and can be<br>
connected electrically.<br>
The webs 20 to 23 of the second head plate 9 can also form a star 31 with<br>
a center 32. In figure 3, a ring around the second star 32 has been omitted for<br>
the sake of clarity.<br>
The centers 29 and 32 are connected to each other by a central rod 33.<br>
An electrically insulating material and an integral design are preferred for<br>
the support device 28.<br><br>
As a consequence of this structural measure, axial forces which act on the<br>
electrode arrangement according to figure 1 are absorbed by the central rod 33.<br>
The electrodes 7 are subjected to scarcely any axial load.<br>
In alternative embodiments, provision may furthermore be made for the<br>
ring 26 to be designed in a manner such that it is extended axially in the manner<br>
of a sleeve. If appropriate, an extension of this type may result in the provision of<br>
a casing wall which completely accommodates the electrodes 7 in the interior.<br>
Given the same axial dimensions, in comparison to an electrode<br>
arrangement having electrodes arranged in parallel and rectilinearly in<br>
accordance with figure 1, it is possible, in the case of an electrode arrangement,<br>
for longer individual electrodes or electrode bundles also to be provided in a<br>
coiled arrangement in order, for example, owing to the greater length of the<br>
individual electrodes, to produce, for example, a higher voltage. All that is<br>
required here for this, in comparison to the illustration which is shown, is for the<br>
stars 30, 31 to be rotated relative to each other.<br>
Figure 4 shows a further exemplary embodiment of an electrode<br>
arrangement schematically in a cross section.<br>
Six electrode bundles 35-40 with in each case ten individual elements 41,<br>
which are reproduced in a simplified manner and have a fuel component flowing<br>
through and/or against them are illustrated there by way of example, which<br>
electrode bundles 35-40 are arranged in each case within a common external<br>
electrode 42-47. In the section which is shown, these common external<br>
electrodes 42-47 enclose sectors of a circle, the opening angles of which are<br>
approximately 60° in the exemplary embodiment.<br>
Opening angles are approximately 60° in the exemplary embodiment.<br>
This geometry in the manner of a piece of cake enables a fuel cell of cylindrical<br><br>
construction to be produced according to figure 4, in which case then, in order to<br>
connect the electrode bundles 35-40 to one another in series, the opposite<br>
surfaces of the external electrodes 42-47 have to be insulated electrically from<br>
one another. Use can be made for this purpose of a support device of an<br>
electrically insulating plastic according to figure 3, in which the webs are<br>
designed such that they are extended axially, in particular reaching as far as the<br>
opposite head plate. Such webs 48-53 then separate the external electrodes 42-<br>
47 and, moreover, also ensure the mechanical support, since the external<br>
electrodes 42-47 are held "in pockets".<br>
In accordance with the above-described exemplary embodiments,<br>
electrode bundles lying next to one another in an encircling manner are bound in<br>
an alternating manner in conductive sector halves of the head plates and also in<br>
succession, and the external electrodes are preferably likewise bound or<br>
connected electrically in another manner. An external electrode 42-47 therefore<br>
forms half of a conductive sector of the head plate.<br><br>
