				<td>PRE-EQUILIBRIUM CHEMICAL REACTION ENERGY CONVERTER<br>
Field Of The Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the extraction of<br>
electrical or mechanical energy or coherent radiation from<br>
chemical reactions occurring on the surface of a catalyst<br>
before thermal equilibrium has been reached by the forms of<br>
the released energy.<br>
Background Information<br>
Recent experimental observations have revealed clues to<br>
various catalytic processes occurring: 1) during the 0.01<br>
pico-second time interval during which chemical reactants form<br>
bonds with the surface of a catalyst, causing the emission of<br>
charge carriers, such as electrons and holes; 2) during the<br>
picosecond time interval during which reactants adsorb and<br>
lose energy in quantum steps after becoming trapped at a<br>
potential well between an adsorbate and a catalyst surface,<br>
producing electronic friction, charge carrier currents and<br>
phonon emission; and 3) during the nanosecond and longer time<br>
intervals during which reaction intermediates and products<br>
radiate electromagnetic energy,, either while trapped on a<br><br>
catalyst surface or immediately after escaping it. These<br>
processes entail three energy releasing processes, namely: l)<br>
charge carrier emission (electrons and holes), 2) phonon<br>
emission and 3) photon emission.<br>
The discovery of these pre-equilibrium emissions provides<br>
new pathways to convert the high grade chemical energy<br>
available during pre-equilibrium phases into useful work. The<br>
term "pre-equilibrium" refers to the period, however brief,<br>
during which the products of reactions have not yet come to<br>
thermal equilibrium. These products include energy emissions,<br>
such as charge carriers; high frequency phonons normally<br>
associated with the optical branch lattice vibrations and with<br>
acoustic branch vibrations of similar wavelength and energy;<br>
and excited state chemical product species.<br>
Prior to the discovery of these rapid energy emission<br>
pathways, the energies resulting from a catalytic process,<br>
such as the heat of adsorption and the heat of formation, were<br>
considered to be heat associated with an equilibrium<br>
condition. Indeed, after tens of femtoseconds, emitted charge<br>
carriers have thermalized and after a few to hundreds of<br>
picoseconds, emitted phonons have thermalized.<br>
Summary Of The Invention<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
emissions of charge carriers, such as electron-hole pairs,<br><br>
generated by chemical activity and reactions on or within<br>
catalyst surfaces, clusters or nanoclusters, are converted<br>
into electric potential. In an exemplary embodiment,<br>
semiconductor diodes such as p-n junctions and Schottky diodes<br>
formed between the catalyst and the semiconductors are used to<br>
carry out the conversion. The diodes are designed to collect<br>
ballistic charge carriers and can be Schottky diodes, pn<br>
junction diodes or diodes formed by various combinations of<br>
metal-semiconductor-oxide structures. The interlayer oxide<br>
thickness is preferably Less than the particular ballistic<br>
mean free path associated with the energy loss of the<br>
appropriate charge carrier (e.g., hole or electron). The<br>
diodes are placed in contact with or near the catalyst<br>
nanolayer or nanocluster within a distance whose order of<br>
magnitude is less than approximately the mean free path of the<br>
appropriate ballistic charge carrier originating in the<br>
catalyst. In one embodiment, the diode is located adjacent to<br>
the catalyst cluster, while in a further embodiment, the diode<br>
is located under the catalyst, as a substrate.<br>
The charge carriers travel ballistically over distances<br>
that can exceed the width of appropriately fabricated<br>
semiconductor junctions, similar to a thermionic effect.<br>
However, unlike the thermionic effect, the charge carriers in<br>
the case of the present Invention need not have energy greater<br>
than the work function of the material involved. The charge<br><br>
carrier motion is trapped as a difference in fermi level, or<br>
chemical potential, between either side of the junction. The<br>
resulting voltage difference is indistinguishable from that of<br>
a photovoltaic collector. However, the charge carrier forces<br>
itself into the valence or conduction band and the circuit<br>
provides a counterpart hole or electron.<br>
The present invention also provides devices and methods<br>
for converting the energy generated by catalytic reactions to<br>
mechanical motion before the energy thermalizes. In an<br>
exemplary embodiment, the converted motion is used to move a<br>
hydraulic fluid against a resisting pressure.<br>
Recent advances in -he art of quantum wells, atomically<br>
smooth superlattices and nanometer scale fabrication permit a<br>
degree of tailoring of the physical parameters to favor a<br>
particular reaction pathway (charge carrier, phonon, photon)<br>
or to enhance the efficiency of the energy collector.<br>
The temperature of operation of a device in accordance<br>
with the present invention can be as low as hundreds of<br>
degrees Kelvin, which is much lower than the typical<br>
operational temperatures of conventional thermophotovoltaics<br>
and thermionic systems (1500 to 2500 Kelvin). Moreover, the<br>
power per mass and power per volume ultimately achievable<br>
using pre-equilibrium emissions in accordance with the present<br>
invention exceeds that of fuel cells, conventional thermo-<br>
photovoltaics, and conventional thermionic systems.<br><br>
Furthermore, in comparison to fuel cells which require<br>
complex ducting, the devices of the present invention allow<br>
mixing of fuel and air in the same duct, thereby simplifying<br>
ducting requirements.<br>
The combination of high volume and mass power density,<br>
simplicity, and lower temperature operation makes the methods<br>
and devices of the present invention competitive and uniquely<br>
useful.<br>

piezoelectrically.<br>
FIG. 4 shows an exemplary embodiment of an<br>

accordance with the present invention.<br>
Detailed Description<br><br>
FIG. 1 shows a cross-sectional view of an exemplary<br>
embodiment of a device in accordance with the present<br>
invention. The device cf FIG. 1, includes a catalyst 105<br>
which is arranged on a top surface of the device to come into<br>
contact with oxidizer molecules 103 and fuel molecules 102.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 1, the catalyst 105 can be<br>
comprised of platinum or palladium, the oxidizer 103 can be<br>
comprised of air and the fuel 102 can be comprised of hydrogen<br>
or a reactant hydrocarbon such as methanol or ethanol.<br>
Exhaust molecules 104 result from the catalyzed reaction.<br>
The exemplary device: of FIG. 1 comprises a pair of<br>
Schottky diodes which act as charge carrier collectors, with<br>
one diode 113 being arranged on the top surface of the device,<br>
adjacent to the catalyst 105 (the "adjacent surface diode")<br>
and the other diode 109 being arranged in the substrate 108,<br>
below the catalyst (the "substrate diode"). An insulating<br>
layer 111 is arranged between the adjacent surface diode 113<br>
and the substrate 108, as shown. The diodes 109 and 113<br>
preferably comprise a bipolar semiconductor material such as<br>
InGaAsSb with a composition chosen to optimize the chosen<br>
operating conditions. For example, the second harmonic of a<br>
CO stretch vibration on a catalyst surface at 2340 per cm<br>
energies gives a photon energy of 0.58 eV. (This matches the<br>
0.53 eV band gap of a recently developed InGaAsSb diode<br>
described in G.W. Charache et al., "InGaAsSb<br><br>
thermophotovoltaic diode: Physics evaluation," Journal of<br>
Applied Physics, Vol. 8E , No. 4, Feb. 1999). The diodes 109<br>
and 113 preferably have relatively low barrier heights, such<br>
as 0.05 to 0.4 volts.<br>
The substrate diode 109 should be forward biased<br>
sufficiently (e.g., up to 3 volts) to raise its conduction and<br>
valence bands above the fermi level of the catalyst 105 so as<br>
to match the energy levels of the adsorbed reactants on the<br>
catalyst surface, such at; oxygen or hydrocarbon free radicals.<br>
This induces resonant tunneling of energy into the substrate<br>
diode 109 by photons. The dimension of the oxide barrier or<br>
the depletion region should be kept to less than the ballistic<br>
transport dimension, which is on the order of 10 nanometers.<br>
A metal such as Mg, Sb, Al,, Ag, Sn Cu or Ni may be used<br>
to form an interlayer 106 between the catalyst 105 and the<br>
semiconductor of the substrate diode 109. The interlayer 106<br>
serves to provide a lattice parameter match between the<br>
catalyst material and the substrate, which in turn provides a<br>
smooth and planar interface surface with which to construct a<br>
quantum well structure consisting of the catalyst, the vacuum<br>
above and the interlayer below. A quantum well structure with<br>
smooth interfaces alters the density of electron states in the<br>
directions toward the substrate and toward the vacuum, so as<br>
to enhance the number of electrons with the desired energy.<br>
The thickness of the catalyst and the interlayer should be<br><br>
small enough to permit ballistic transport of charge carriers.<br>
This dimension is typically less than 20 nanometers. Quantum<br>
well structures with thickness less than 0.5 nanometer are<br>
possible in the present state of the art. The quantum well<br>
structure may be constructed as an island, like a pancake on a<br>
surface (also referred to as a "quantum dot").<br>
The device of FIG. 1 may also include a non-conducting<br>
layer 107 arranged between the substrate diode 109 and the<br>
catalyst 105. The layer 107, which can be comprised of an<br>
oxide, permits forward-biasing of the diode 109 without a<br>
significant increase in the forward current. The layer 107<br>
provides a barrier against such forward current. An optional<br>
oxide 114 barrier may also be arranged on the surface of the<br>
device between the catalyst 105 and the surface diode 113.<br>
Electrical contacts 101, 110 and 112 are arranged as<br>
shown in FIG. 1. Contacts 101 and 110 serve as electrical<br>
output leads for the substrate diode. Contacts 101 and 112<br>
are the electrical output leads for the surface diode.<br>
In the device of FIG. 1, the catalyst layer 105 may<br>
comprise a quantum well structure (including quantum dots)<br>
having a thickness typically less than 20 ran and being<br>
sufficiently small so as to alter the density of electron<br>
states in the -catalyst to favor the production of<br>
substantially monoenergetic holes or electrons. The substrate<br>
diode 109 and the catalyst 105 may be separated by an<br><br>
interlayer 106 of metal, that permits matching the lattice<br>
parameters of the catalyst to this interlayer. The catalyst<br>
105 and interlayer 106 comprise the quantum well . The <br>
interlayer 106 must be sufficiently thin so as to permit non-<br>
energy changing electron transport into the diode. The<br>
thickness of the interlayer 106 should be preferably less than<br>
20 nanometers.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of a device in accordance with<br>
the present invention, the substrate diode 109 comprises an n-<br>
type direct band gap semiconductor with a band gap chosen to<br>
favor the emission of energetic electrons.<br>
In a further exemplary embodiment, the thickness or<br>
cluster size (if arranged in clusters) of the catalyst layer<br>
105 is sufficiently small so as to permit the appearance of<br>
band gaps, discrete electron states and catalyst properties<br>
unlike the same material in bulk. In this case, the catalyst<br>
105 can be comprised, preferably, of gold, silver, copper, or<br>
nickel and be arranged as3 monolayer, 200 atom clusters.<br>
FIG. 2 shows an exetnplary embodiment of a device in<br>
accordance with the present invention in which the emissions<br>
of phonons generated by adsorbing and bonding reactions on or<br>
within catalyst surfaces clusters or nano-structures are<br>
converted into hydraulic fluid pressure.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, pressures<br>
generated by phonons directed - into a catalyst body on a first<br><br>
side of the catalyst body form a phonon wave which can be<br>
guided by the geometry of the catalyst (or. substrate upon<br>
which the catalyst may be situated) so that the phonons travel<br>
to the other side of the substrate and impart a pressure onto<br>
a fluid. The thickness of this travel should be less than the<br>
mean distance over which the direction of the phonon remains<br>
substantially unperturbed. The phonons arrive at an angle (a<br>
"grazing" angle) such that the directional and asymmetric<br>
pressure of the arriving phonons appears as wave motion on the<br>
other side of the catalyst body which pushes against a fluid<br>
such as a liquid metal or sacrificial interface, causing it to<br>
move in a direction parallel to the bottom surface. An<br>
apparent negative coefficient of friction between the wall and<br>
the fluid is exhibited due to the wave motion or directed<br>
impulses along the surface of the bottom of the device.<br>
The exemplary device comprises a substrate 202 with top<br>
and bottom surfaces having a saw-tooth pattern, as shown in<br>
the cross-sectional view of FIG. 2. The bottom surface is in<br>
contact with a hydraulic fluid 204. As shown in FIG. 2, the<br>
substrate can be thought of as comprising a plurality of sub-<br>
structures 200 having rectangular cross-sections and arranged<br>
adjacent to each other at an angle with respect to the<br>
hydraulic fluid 204.<br>
At the top surface of the substrate, each sub-structure<br>
200 includes a layer 2C1 comprising a catalyst. On an exposed<br><br><br>
side surface between adjacent sub-structures, each sub-<br>
structure 200 includes a layer 202 of material which is inert<br>
with respect to the catalyst and the reactants. The body of<br>
each sub-structure is conprised of a substrate 203, which also<br>
acts as a phonon waveguide. Platinum can be used for the<br>
catalyst layer 201 and for the substrate 203 with air as the<br>
oxidizer, ethanol or methanol as the hydrocarbon reactant fuel<br>
and water or mercury as the hydraulic fluid 204. The<br>
hydraulic fluid can also serve as a coolant for the device,<br>
thereby permitting high power density operation.<br>
The catalyst 201 and substrate 203 may be comprised of<br>
the same material, e.g., platinum. Other substrate materials<br>
may be used based on structural considerations,<br>
manufacturability and/or impedance matching so as to maximize<br>
the propagation of the phonon motion into the hydraulic fluid.<br>
The thickness of the platinum catalyst layer 201 and<br>
substrate 203 should be less than the energy-changing mean<br>
free path of optical branch phonons or high frequency acoustic<br>
branch phonons, which is at least of order 10 nanometers and<br>
can be as large as one micron.<br>
Nanofabrication methods can be used to form the sawtooth<br>
patterns on the surfaces of the substrate 202, with the<br>
dimension of as unit of such pattern being as large as 1<br>
micron.<br><br>
By depositing the inert layers 202 as shown, e.g., on the<br>
right-facing facets of the saw-tooth pattern of the top<br>
surface, a preferential direction is thereby established for<br>
reactions and thus for phonon propagation, as indicated by the<br>
arrow in FIG. 2.<br>
Acoustic, ultrasonic or gigahertz acoustic Rayleigh waves<br>
on the catalyst side can be used to stimulate the reaction<br>
rate and synchronize the emission of phonons. The waves<br>
increase the magnitude of. the phonon emission and cause<br>
coherent emission, greatly enhancing both the peak and average<br>
power.<br>
In a further embodiment, a thin layer or layers of<br>
material are arranged between the substrate and the fluid.<br>
These layers are comprised of materials having acoustic<br>
impedances between that cf the substrate 202 and the hydraulic<br>
fluid 204, so as to maxirrize the transmission of momentum into<br>
the hydraulic fluid and minimize reflections back into the<br>
substrate 2 04. The material should be selected so that the<br>
bulk modulus and phonon propagation properties of the material<br>
cause the phonons emerging from the substrate to be<br>
transmittied substantially into the fluid with minimal<br>
reflection and energy loss.<br>
In a further embodiment of a device in accordance with<br>
the present invention, the emissions of phonons generated by<br>
catalytic reactions are converted into electrical current by<br><br>
piezo-electric effects within materials as the phonons impact<br>
the materials. An exempLary embodiment of such a device is<br>
shown in FIG. 3.<br>
The exemplary device of FIG. 3 comprises a catalyst layer<br>
301 arranged on a piezo-electric element 303, which is in turn<br>
arranged on a supporting substrate 304. The catalyst layer<br>
301 can be implemented as a nanocluster, nanolayer or quantum<br>
well. Electrical leads 3 02 are provided at opposite ends of<br>
the piezo-electric element 303 across which a potential is<br>
developed, in accordance with the present invention. In the<br>
exemplary embodiment of FIG. 3, the catalyst layer 301<br>
comprises platinum, with air as the oxidizer and ethanol or<br>
methanol as the hydrocarbon reactant fuel. The piezo-electric<br>
element 303 can comprise any piezomaterial, including<br>
semiconductors that are not normally piezoelectric, such as<br>
InGaAsSb. The lattice mismatch between the semiconductor and<br>
the platinum produces a strain, commonly called a deformation<br>
potential which induces piezoelectric properties in<br>
semiconductors, or ferroelectric or piezoelectric materials<br>
with a high nonlinearity such as (Ba, Sr)TiO3 thin films,<br>
AlxGa1-xAs/GaAs and strained layer InGaAs/GaAs (lll)B quantum<br>
well p-i-n structures.<br>
Where the- piezoelectric element 3 03 is comprised of a<br>
semiconductor, the semiconductor becomes a diode element that<br><br>
converts photons into electricity, collects electrons as<br>
electricity, and converts phonons into electricity.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 3, as the reactants<br>
interact with the catalytic layer 301, phonons generated by<br>
the reactions are conducted into the piezoelectric material<br>
303. As a result, a potential is induced in the piezoelectric<br>
material 303 at the electrical contacts 302.<br>
The geometry of the substrate 303 is preferably such as<br>
to focus phonons so as to enhance the nonlinearity of the<br>
piezoelectric element 303. This results in self-rectification<br>
of the high frequency phonons. In an exemplary embodiment,<br>
the piezoelectric element 303 is preferably curved and shaped<br>
like a lens or concentrating reflector so as to focus the<br>
phonons generated by the catalyst on to the piezoelectric<br>
material. The focusing of the phonons causes large amplitude<br>
atomic motions at the focus. The atomic motions induced by<br>
this focusing cause the piezoelectric material to become<br>
nonlinear, causing non-linear responses such as the generation<br>
of electricity in the material at the focus. This in turn<br>
results in the piezo-material becoming a rectifier of the<br>
phonon-induced high frequency current.<br>
Acoustic, ultrasonic or gigahertz acoustic Rayleigh waves<br>
can be used on the catalyst side of the exemplary device of<br>
FIG. 3 to stimulate the reaction rate and synchronize the<br>
emission of phonons, to enhance the magnitude of the phonon<br><br>
emission and to cause coherent emission, greatly enhancing<br>
both the peak and average power delivered to the piezoelectric<br>
material 303. Acoustic Rayleigh waves accelerate oxidation<br>
reactions on platinum catalyst surfaces. Surface acoustic<br>
waves can be generated on the surface of the catalyst 3 01<br>
using a generator (not shown) . Such waves may have acoustic,<br>
ultrasonic or gigahertz frequencies. The Rayleigh waves<br>
induce reactions so as to synchronize the reactions, which in<br>
turn synchronizes the emission of phonons. The result is a<br>
pulsing bunching of the reactions, which enhances the power<br>
delivered to the piezoelectric material 303.<br>
The frequency of operation of the device of FIG. 3 is<br>
preferably in the GHz range and lower so that rectification of<br>
the alternating currents produced by the piezoelectric<br>
material 303 can be achieved with conventional means, such as<br>
with semiconductor diodes.<br>
In a further exemplary embodiment of the present<br>
invention, electromagnetic radiation, such as infrared photons<br>
emitted by excited state products such as highly vibrationally<br>
excited radicals and final product molecules, is converted<br>
into electricity photovoltaically. Stimulated emission of<br>
radiation is used to extract the energy from the excited state<br>
products, such as highly vibrationally excited radical and<br>
reaction product molecules both on the catalyst surface and<br>
desorbing from it. The extracted energy appears in the form<br><br>
of a coherent beam or a super-radiant beam of infra-red or<br>
optical energy. The frequencies of the radiation correspond<br>
to fundamental (vibration quantum number change of 1) or<br>
overtones (vibration quantum number change 2 or greater) of<br>
the normal mode vibration frequencies of the reactants.<br>
Several different frequencies may be extracted simultaneously<br>
in this invention. While; the resulting coherent beam is<br>
useful in its own right, this high intensity beam can also be<br>
photovoltaically converted into electricity. In accordance<br>
with the present invention, such emissions are created by<br>
reactions on catalyst surfaces, and are accelerated by the use<br>
of optical cavities. FIG. 4 shows an exemplary embodiment of<br>
an electric generator for performing such a conversion.<br>
The device of FIG. 4 comprises one or more substrates 401<br>
upon which a catalyst 402 is arranged in a plurality of<br>
islands, nanoclusters, quantum well clusters or quantum dots.<br>
The catalyst clusters are sufficiently spaced apart (e.g.,<br>
tens of nanometers or more) and the substrate is made<br>
sufficiently thin (e.g., Less than a centimeter total optical<br>
thickness), so that IR absorbtion is mitigated at the<br>
frequencies of specie emission. The assembly of catalyst<br>
clusters on the substrates 401 is substantially transparent to<br>
the reaction radiations. The catalyst 402 is preferably<br>
platinum or palladium. The device preferably comprises a<br><br>
plurality of substrates 401 stacked so as to permit a volume<br>
of reactions.<br>
The catalyst-substrate stack 401/402 is enclosed in an<br>
optical cavity having a highly reflective element 403 and a<br>
less reflective element 404 arranged as shown in FIG. 4. The<br>
optical cavity and the catalyst-substrate stack 401/402 are<br>
preferably resonant to the reaction radiations or their<br>
overtones. The optical cavity can be used to stimulate<br>
overtone radiation, i.e., multipole radiation where the change<br>
in quantum number is 2 or more, to increase the energy of the<br>
radiation. The optical cavity preferably has multiple<br>
frequencies, as in a Fabrey-Perot cavity, that are tuned to<br>
overtones of the specie frequencies.<br>
A fuel 407, such as hydrogen, ethanol or methanol and an<br>
oxidizer 408, such as air, are introduced into the optical<br>
cavity where they interact with the catalyst-substrate stack<br>
401/402. Lean mixtures of fuel can be used so as to minimize<br>
resonant transfer, exchange or decay of excited state<br>
vibrational energy to other specie of the same chemical makeup<br>
in the exhaust stream, during the time these species are in<br>
the optical cavity and the photovoltaic converter 405 collects<br>
the radiation and converts it into electricity.<br>
A stimulated emission initiator and synchronizer device<br>
412 is used to initiate and synchronize the emissions in the<br>
optical cavity. The device 412 can be a commonly available<br><br>
The chemical reactants on the catalyst surface permit<br>
overtone transitions because they are part of a "ladder" of<br>
transitions and strongly polarized on the catalyst surface,<br>
which permits all the transitions to have non-zero dipole<br>
radiation transition matrix elements. Also, the reactants<br>
have no rotational smearing associated with free molecules in<br>
a gas because they are attached to the surface and can not<br>
rotate. These features permit a near monochromatic overtone<br>
light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.<br>
The electromagnetic energy radiated by the stimulation of<br>
species, as in the embodiment of FIG. 4, can be formed into<br>
high brightness, quasi-monochromatic, poly-chromatic<br>
radiations or coherent beams.<br>
In each of the above described embodiments which include<br>
photovoltaic semiconductors, the catalyst is preferably<br>
operated at a high surface power density, e.g., in excess of<br>
10 watts per square centimeter or with a peak surface power<br>
density of at least one watt per square centimeter, to enhance<br>
the efficiency of the photovoltaic semiconductors.<br><br>
