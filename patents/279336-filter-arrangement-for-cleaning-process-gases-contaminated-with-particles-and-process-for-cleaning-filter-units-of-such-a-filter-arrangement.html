Filter Arrangement for Cleaning Process Gases Contaminated with Particles<br>
and Process for Cleaning Filter Units of Such a Filter Arrangement<br>
The present invention pertains to a filter arrangement for cleaning gases contaminated with<br>
particles, with at least one filter unit with an exterior filter and an interior filter as well as to a<br>
process for cleaning at least one filter unit with an exterior filter and an interior filter of a filter<br>
arrangement, which said interior filter is arranged in said exterior filter.<br>
The present invention pertains to a filter arrangement, which is arranged above and on a process<br>
container, in which particulate product is treated, e.g., by mixing, drying, granulation, pelletizing<br>
and/or coating the product. The process may consist of agglomerating or granulating product<br>
particles having the fineness of dust in the process container into larger particles or of providing<br>
particulate starting product with a coat by means of coating. A bottom, which is permeable to air<br>
and has passages, especially in the form of slots, is usually provided for this in the lower region of<br>
the process container.<br>
A filter unit, comprising a cylindrical exterior filter and an interior filter tapering conically from<br>
bottom to top, is known from DE 40 29 994 C2.<br>
Air contaminated with particles, such as dusty air, is delivered in the product-treating process<br>
operation from the outside through the exterior filter and from the inside through the interior filter<br>
 <br>
into an intermediate space between the exterior filter and the interior filter of the filter unit and via<br>
an opened valve to a gas outlet.<br>
To blow off dust collected on the outside of the exterior filter and on the inside of the interior filter,<br>
the valve is closed and an air path from a gas inlet for clean gas to the intermediate space between<br>
the interior filter and the exterior filter is opened via another valve, so that blowing off of particles<br>
adhering to the outside of the exterior filter and to the inside of the interior filter can take place in<br>
counterflow. Complete cleaning is not always possible hereby on the side of the filters facing the<br>
dusty air, and removal of filter dust having penetrated into the clean air region can be performed<br>
with difficulty only. For complete cleaning, the filter unit must be removed and disassembled and<br>
the individual filters must then be cleaned one by one. Consequently, cleaning in place (CIP) is not<br>
possible in the state of the art without removal of the filter cartridges.<br>
The basic object of the present invention is therefore to provide a filter arrangement of the type<br>
mentioned in the introduction, which and especially the filter units of which can be cleaned<br>
completely and comprehensively in place, and to propose a process for carrying out such cleaning.<br>
Said object is accomplished according to the present invention in a filter arrangement of the type<br>
mentioned in the introduction by the exterior filter and the interior filter being able to be moved in<br>
relation to be another, thereby exposing a gap in their lower regions.<br>
For cleaning, the present invention provides for a process of the above-mentioned type, in which<br>
provisions are fundamentally made for the region of the filter unit on the clean gas side to be<br>
cleaned [by means of- word(s) missing in German original - Tr.Ed.] cleaning fluid sprayed while<br>
exposing a gap in the lower regions of the exterior filter and interior filter. This can be carried out<br>
especially by means of a cleaning lance protruding into the clean gas region.<br>
 <br>
Due to the fact that the two individual filters of the filter unit of the filter arrangement according to<br>
the present invention, namely, the interior filter and the exterior filter, are not connected rigidly to<br>
one another but a gap or slot can be exposed at the site in the lower regions thereof by a relative<br>
motion, it is possible, on the one hand, to carry out cleaning, as it is provided for according to the<br>
above fundamental process step, by means of (CIP) fluid sprayed into the clean space region<br>
between the interior filter and the exterior filter and for the contaminants entrained by said fluid to<br>
leave the filter unit through the gap, after which they can be further removed via the process<br>
arrangement. Furthermore, it is possible to perform ultrasonic cleaning if the filter unit is equipped<br>
with metal filters, for which a liquid coupling medium is necessary between the interior filter and<br>
the exterior filter, ["which" - word missing in German original - Tr.Ed.] can be filled into the<br>
intermediate space such that more fluid is fed than can be discharged through the filters themselves,<br>
wherein an ultrasound transducer protrudes into the coupling medium to generate the ultrasound in<br>
said coupling medium and the coupling fluid can finally flow off again together with contaminants<br>
removed from the filters through the gap by opening said gap after the cleaning. Finally, it is<br>
possible to carry out a drying of the filters on the inside and outside with the gap opened by drying<br>
air flowing in from the slotted disk of the process arrangement.<br>
In a variant, the present invention provides for the exterior filter and the interior filter to be able to<br>
be moved relative to one another while exposing an annular gap, wherein especially the interior<br>
filter can be lifted off relative to the exterior filter or the interior filter can be lowered relative to the<br>
exterior filter. The drive for generating the relative motion between the interior filter and the<br>
exterior filter is brought about by a drive means outside the filter unit, for example, via an actuating<br>
rod. To fully utilize the possibility of cleaning created by the embodiment of the filter arrangement<br>
according to the present invention, the present invention provides, in a variant, for a means for<br>
blowing fluid, especially gas, into the region of the filter unit on the clean gas side and for a means<br>
for closing off the region of the filter unit on the clean space side against an outlet and by [sic -<br>
 <br>
Tr.Ed.] a lance protruding in the region of the filter unit on the clean space side for spraying<br>
cleaning liquid into this region of the filter unit as well as by [sic - Tr.Ed.] a cleaning lance<br>
protruding into the exterior space of the at least one filter unit, which said exterior space faces away<br>
from the clean side, especially into a filter dome surrounding this [filter unit] for cleaning the sides<br>
of the filter unit exposed to the gas contaminated with particles by means of a liquid.<br>
Provisions are made in a variant of the process according to the present invention for the gap in the<br>
lower region between the exterior filter and the interior filter of the at least one filter unit to be<br>
opened by lowering or raising the interior filter in relation to the exterior filter and to be closed by<br>
an opposite motion. Cleaning steps can be provided within the framework of the process according<br>
to the present invention such that cleaning gas is blown into the filter unit preferably in advance,<br>
while a gas outlet is closed, from the region of the filter unit on the clean space side and through the<br>
filters of said filter unit against the direction of flow during the cleaning operation of said filter unit;<br>
that regions of the filter facing away from the clean gas space are cleaned by means of a cleaning<br>
liquid ejected from a cleaning lance, and that, as was already stated, drying of the at least one filter<br>
unit is performed while opening the gap between the exterior filter and the interior filter. For<br>
cleaning by mans of ultrasound, the present invention makes provisions, prior to the drying, for<br>
metal filters of the filter unit to be cleaned by introducing a coupling liquid into the intermediate<br>
space between the exterior filter and the interior filter with the gap between the two filters closed by<br>
means of an ultrasound source protruding into the intermediate space.<br>
Other advantages and features of the present invention appear from the claims and from the<br>
following description, in which exemplary embodiments of the present invention are explained in<br>
detail with reference to the drawings. Specifically,<br>
 <br>
Figure 1	shows a schematic vertical longitudinal section through a filter arrangement<br>
according to the present invention on a process container;<br>
Figure 2	shows a longitudinal section through the top side of a filter dome with two filter<br>
units, of which the one on the right-hand side filters process air, while the one on the<br>
left-hand side is switched for cleaning the filters;<br>
Figure 3	shows a longitudinal section through the filter arrangement according to the present<br>
invention with view of the clean gas side cleaning of the filters by means of cleaning<br>
liquid;<br>
Figure 4	shows a filter arrangement, which is additionally provided with an ultrasound source<br>
for ultrasonic cleaning in case of metal filters;<br>
Figure 5	shows a view of the filter arrangement according to the present invention to illustrate<br>
the drying operation of the filters;<br>
Figure 6	shows alternative embodiments of the relative mobility of the interior and exterior<br>
filters of the filter units; and<br>
Figure 7	shows alternative embodiments of the relative mobility of the interior and exterior<br>
filters of the filter units with a lowerable intermediate bottom.<br>
Figure 1 shows the filter arrangement 1 according to the present invention arranged on a process<br>
container 2 tapering conically from top to bottom. For example, particulate matter is treated in such<br>
a process container 2, e.g., by mixing, drying, granulating, pelletizing and/or coating the product.<br>
 <br>
Thus, product particles having the fineness of dust can be agglomerated and thus granulated in the<br>
process container ["in den" in line 31, p. 6 is a typo for "in dem" or "im" - Tr.Ed.] into larger<br>
particles, or else particulate starting product can be provided with a coat by coating. A bottom 2.1,<br>
which is permeable to air and has passages, especially in the form of slots, is usually provided for<br>
this in the lower region of the process container 2. Nozzles, which make it possible to spray on a<br>
coating medium, may be arranged integrated in said bottom or in the cylindrical wall.<br>
The filter arrangement 1 according to the present invention has a plurality of, usually three to six,<br>
filter units 3 in a housing-like filter dome 1.1. Such a filter unit 3 has an exterior filter filter [sic -<br>
Tr.Ed.] 3.1 and an interior filter 3.2, wherein said exterior filter 3.1 is usually cylindrical and is<br>
cylindrical in the exemplary embodiment being shown, whereas said interior filter 3.2 is usually<br>
conical and is conical, namely, tapering from top to bottom, in the exemplary embodiment being<br>
shown.<br>
In the process operation, i.e., when the filter units 3 clean or remove dust from air contaminated<br>
with dust or from a gas contaminated with dust, which air is present in the process container 2 and<br>
in the filter dome 1.1, the lower edges of the exterior filter 3.1 and interior filter 3.2 are aligned with<br>
one another and are connected to one another via a closed annular area 3.4, as this corresponds to<br>
the state of the art. The top side of the interior filter 3.2 ends below the top end of the exterior filter<br>
3.1. The filter area is markedly enlarged, nearly doubled, by the filter unit 3 designed in such a way<br>
as a double filter with an exterior filter 3.1 and an interior filter 3.2 compared to a, for example,<br>
cylindrical single filter.<br>
The ring jacket-like intermediate space 3.5 between the exterior filter and interior filter 3.1, 3.2, into<br>
which the clean air flows through the filters, is in connection with an outlet region 3.6 for the clean<br>
 <br>
air above the interior filter 3.2, which [region] is in turn in fluid connection with a exhaust air tube<br>
3.8 via a flap 3.7, which is to be opened.<br>
The interior filter 3.2 is connected via an actuating rod 3.3.1 to a drive 3.3.2, by which the interior<br>
filter 3.1 [sic - Tr.Ed.] can be lowered in the exemplary embodiment shown in Figure 1 or - in the<br>
exemplary embodiment to the left in Figures 6 and 7 - also raised, as a result of which an annular<br>
gap 3.9 is opened to the intermediate space 3.5 between the exterior and interior filters 3.1, 3.2<br>
between the lower regions of the exterior and interior filters 3.1, 3.2. The drive may be, for<br>
example, a hydraulic or pneumatic drive with a piston-and-cylinder arrangement or also an electric<br>
drive, be it an electric motor drive or an electromagnetic drive.<br>
Furthermore, a cleaning device 4 is provided, which has a fluid feed line 4.1 and a lance 4.2, which<br>
protrudes into the outlet region 3.6 and cylindrically surrounds the drive rod 3.3.1 in the exemplary<br>
embodiment being shown and has a discharge opening at its top end, at a vertically spaced location<br>
from the top side of the interior filter 3.2.The clean air side of the filters can be cleaned hereby as<br>
this will be described below.<br>
A cleaning lance 5.1 with an outlet 5.2 for a cleaning fluid protrudes into the exhaust air space 3.6<br>
for the process gas.<br>
Finally, a straight-jet nozzle cleaner 6 with a liquid feed 6.1, with a lance 6.2 protruding<br>
approximately centrally into the filter dome 1.1 and with a discharge nozzle 6.3 arranged at the end<br>
of lance 6.2 is located in the lower region of the filter dome 1.1. As will be described below,<br>
cleaning of the outside of the filters 3.2, 3.3 can be carried out hereby.<br>
 <br>
The filters are metal filters in the embodiment according to Figure 4, i.e., they are screen-covered.<br>
The present invention provides for an ultrasound transducer 7 protruding into the intermediate<br>
space of each filter unit 3 between the exterior and interior filters 3.1, 3.2 for additional cleaning in<br>
this case. A liquid, such as a CIP liquid 8, is filled in as a coupling medium between the ultrasound<br>
transducer 7 and the filters 3.1, 3.2.<br>
Figure 5 shows that dry air is blown in the space between the interior of the filter dome 1.1 through<br>
the air-permeable bottom 2.1 to dry the filters 3.1, 3.2, especially if they are fabric filters, but also<br>
in case of metal filters with the process space emptied.<br>
The process for cleaning the filter unit equipped in this manner according to the present invention<br>
takes place as follows:<br>
During the operation process, during which particulate product is being treated in the process<br>
container 2 in the above-described manner by blowing in air or gas through the air-permeable<br>
bottom 2.1, this gas enters the interior of the filter unit 3, as this can be seen especially in the filter<br>
unit 3 on the right-hand side in Figure 2, from the outside through the exterior filter 3.1 and from<br>
the inside through the interior filter 3.2 and is cleaned in the process by the filters 3.1, 3.2. It flows<br>
through the outlet region 3.6 and escapes via the exhaust air tube 3.8 of the filter arrangement 1<br>
with the flap 3.7 open, after which it can be returned via bottom 2.1.<br>
If the filters 3.1, 3.2 are to be cleaned in place (CIP = cleaning in place), flap 3.7 in the exhaust gas<br>
duct 3.8 is closed for a first cleaning step and cleaning fluid, such as air or an inert gas is<br>
subsequently blown into the interior of filter unit 3 and hence through the filters 3.1, 3.2 from the<br>
clean gas side via the fluid feed line 4.1 and lance 4.2, as this is shown in Figure 1 and on the left-<br>
 <br>
hand side of Figure 2, so that material adhering on the process side of these filters, such as<br>
granulating material, coating material or the like, is blown off from the filters.<br>
The interior and exterior filters 3.1, 3.2 are now in a relative position, in which the annular gap 3.9<br>
on their undersides is closed.<br>
In a next step - in the embodiment according to Figure 3 - the interior filter 3.2 is raised by drive<br>
3.3.2 by means of the actuating rod 3.3.1 in relation to the exterior filter 3.2 (Figure 3), so that the<br>
annular gap 3.9 is opened. Cleaning liquid, so-called CIP liquid, is subsequently sprayed into the<br>
interior space of the exterior filter 3.1 and into the intermediate space between this and the interior<br>
filter 3.2 via the cleaning lance 5.1, so that material that may adhere on the inside of the exterior<br>
filter 3.1 and/or on the radially outer side of the interior filter 3.2 can be flushed out via the annular<br>
gap 3.9.<br>
As was stated, an ultrasound transducer protruding into the intermediate space between the exterior<br>
and interior filters 3.1, 3.2 may be provided for further cleaning if the filters 3.1, 3.2 are metal<br>
filters. Liquid continues to be sprayed in this case into the interior space of the filter unit with the<br>
annular gap 3.9 closed, the quantity of such liquid sprayed exceeding the quantity that can flow off<br>
through the filters, as a result of which liquid 8 will collect in the interior space, and this liquid will<br>
act as a coupling medium for the ultrasound. The ultrasound transducer 7 is activated and effective<br>
removal of material adhering to the inside of the exterior filter 3.1 and to the outside of the interior<br>
filter 3.2, such as coating material or the like, takes place, and such material migrates into the liquid<br>
8.<br>
This [liquid] can then be drained off by raising - in the embodiment according to Figure 3 - the<br>
interior filter 3.2 relative to the exterior filter 3.1 by means of drive 3.3.2 and by mediation by the<br>
actuating rod 3.3.1.<br>
 <br>
In a next step, which is shown in Figure 1, the outside of the exterior filter 3.1 and the inside of the<br>
interior filter 3.2 are cleaned by means of the straight-jet nozzle cleaner 6 by means of liquid (CIP<br>
liquid) fed via the liquid feed 6.1 thereof via said lance 6.2 thereof and said discharge nozzle 6.3.<br>
Finally, drying of the entire interior space of the filter arrangement 1 and especially of the filter<br>
units 3 is carried out (Figure 5) by dry air or dry gas fed via the slotted bottom 2.1.<br>
Figure 6 shows on the right-hand side an alternative embodiment of a filter unit according to the<br>
present invention for comparison with the filter unit that is embodied in the embodiment on the left-<br>
hand side of Figures 1 through 5 and is described in detail there.<br>
Filter unit 3' on the right-hand side of Figure 6 has fundamentally the same design as the filter unit<br>
3 and has the same elements, which are provided with the same reference numbers. Only the<br>
interior filter 3.2 can be lowered rather than raised in relation to the exterior filter to generate the<br>
slot-like gap 3.9.<br>
With the two alternatives of the interior filter 3.2 that can be raised or lifted off, Figure 7 shows<br>
another alternative embodiment, in which a lowerable intermediate bottom is provided in the filter<br>
dome 1.1 above the filters 3 or exterior filters 3.1.<br>

In order to improve a cleaning of filter units of a<br>
filter arrangement of a process container provided for<br>
the treatment of a product at the site of the filter<br>
units without disassembly of the same (cleaning in<br>
place - CIP), the invention provides a filter<br>
arrangement for cleaning gases contaminated with<br>
particles, having at least one filter unit comprising<br>
an exterior and an interior filter (3.1, 3.2), wherein<br>
the exterior and interior filters can be moved relative<br>
to each other, thereby exposing an opening (3.4) in the<br>
bottom regions thereof. A method for cleaning according<br>
to the invention is further characterized in that the<br>
 region of the filter unit on the clean gas side is<br>
cleaned by cleaning fluid sprayed by means of a<br>
cleaning lance protruding into the clean gas region<br>
while exposing a gap (3.4) in the bottom region of the<br>
exterior and interior filters.<br>
