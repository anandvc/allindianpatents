LIQUID ABRASIVE CLEANING COMPOSITIONS<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House,  165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The  following  specification   particularly  describes  the  nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
GRANTED<br>
6-3-2006<br>
ORIGINAL<br>
188/MUMNP/2005<br><br>
WO 03/031554<br><br>
PCT/EP02/11063<br><br>
LIQUID ABRASIVE CLEANING COMPOSITIONS<br>
Field of the invention 5<br>
The invention relates to aqueous liquid compositions which include an abrasive and a polymeric thickening agent to keep the abrasive suspended in the liquid.<br>
10  Background of the invention<br>
Liquid abrasive cleaning compositions are well known in the art and often comprise a combination of anionic and nonionic surfactants, which together form a lamellar micelle aqueous 15  phase which acts as a suspending system to keep the solid abrasive in a stable suspension. Often a polymeric thickening agent is added to further improve the stability of the suspension.<br>
20  Thus, in WO 91/08283 liquid abrasive cleaning compositions are disclosed, comprising 0. 02-20-% of detergent, l-70% of particulate abrasive and 0.01-10% of a thickening mixture consisting of a linear non-starch type polymer and a branched starch type polymer (amylopectin).<br>
25<br>
In WO 95/08619 liquid abrasive cleaning compositions are disclosed comprising a cross-linked polyacrylate, at least one non-ionic surfactant, a pH adjusting agent and a calcium carbonate abrasive. The compositions contain 0.1-2% of<br>
30  polyacrylate, 0.1-10% of nonionic, up to 10% anionic and 5-60% abrasive. Similar compositions are disclosed in EP<br><br>
WO 03/031554<br><br>
PCT/EP02/11063<br><br>
649898 with the extra proviso that they contain hypochlorite and that the surfactant is bleach-stable.<br>
In WO 96/35771 liquid abrasive cleaning compositions are 5  disclosed comprising 10-30% of inorganic abrasive and a thickening system which consists of a cross-linked polyacrylate polymer and a smectite-type clay whereby the latter forms 50-80% of the thickening system. The thickening system comprises 1-2.5% of the composition.<br>
EP 0 301 885 discloses liquid abrasive cleaning compositions comprising up to 70% of abrasive, an aqueous suspending medium made of a combination of anionic surfactants and electrolyte and also comprising a polyacrylate material 15  having a molecular weight of between 500 and 3000.<br>
EP 0 570 226 discloses liquid abrasive cleaning compositions comprising a water-soluble abrasive in an amount exceeding the solubility in the composition, but at least 20%. Na 20  tripolyphosphate is mentioned as one of the possible<br>
abrasives. The composition furthermore contains at least 0.5% of an anionic surfactant and 1% or more of a low molecular weight (
25  A similar kind of product is disclosed in EP 0 193 375<br>
comprising at least 6% of the water soluble salt used as the abrasive and at least 1.5% of a surfactant mixture having structuring and suspending properties. The composition may optionally contain up to 10% of insoluble abrasive and a<br>
        30     polymeric structuring aid such as Carbopol™.<br><br>
WO 03/031554<br><br>
PCT/EP02/11063<br><br>
WO 98/49261 discloses liquid abrasive cleaning compositions comprising a combination of anionic and nonionic surfactants forming a suspending system. That combination generally comprises at least 1.0% of anionic surfactant and at least 5  0.5% of nonionic surfactant. The composition may optionally contain a polymeric structuring aid such as Carbopol™. The composition may also optionally contain a detergent builder such as a water-soluble phosphate.<br>
10  Liquid abrasive cleaning compositions are normally sold in a ready to use form that contains 10-50%, generally 20-45% solid abrasive. Such compositions cannot be diluted to e.g. 10-20% solid abrasive content without losing their stability leading to sedimentation. Although in the patent literature<br>
15  abrasive contents of up to 70% are quoted, such contents are not normally found in commercial products.<br>
In WO 01/05931 liquid abrasive cleaning compositions are disclosed comprising 10-95% of abrasive and 0.05-0.70% of an<br>
20  anionic thickening polymer. The preferred abrasive is caicite. Compositions. comprising up to 50% abrasive are primarily intended as ready-to-use products. Compositions containing 45% abrasive or more can also be diluted with water to form a stable ready-to-use abrasive cleaner.<br>
              25<br>
While anionic polymers are.generally efficient thickening agents for liquid abrasive cleaning compositions (LAC), it was found that such polymers which are hydrophobically modified and/or have a relatively low charge density do not<br>
         30    give a totally satisfactory reology for liquid ready-to-use products and may be lead to instability of the suspension at<br><br>
WO 03/031554<br><br>
PCT/EP02/11063<br><br>
high temperatures. On the other hand, anionic polymers with a high content of carboxylate groups do give the right reology and high temperature stability, but in LAC's comprising calcite or dolomite as the abrasive, they are the 5  cause of instability if the compositions are subjected to repeated freeze/thaw cycles, as may occur during storage in winter. This instability results in flocculation or even sedimentation of the solids in the composition.<br>
10<br>
Brief description of the invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide aqueous liquid abrasive cleaning compositions comprising calcite or 15  dolomite abrasive and a polycarboxylate thickener with a high carboxylate group content, which can be frozen and thawed without loosing stability.<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides liquid aqueous abrasive 20  cleaning compositions comprising an insoluble abrasive, an anionic thickening polymer with a high carboxylate group content and a phosphate or phosphonate salt capable of sequestering Ca2+  ions.<br>
25<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
All percentages given herein are by weight and based on the total composition unless specified otherwise.<br><br>
WO 03/031554<br><br>
PCT/EP02/11063<br><br>
The term "liquid" as used herein refers to products which are easily pourable, as well as to products which are thick, almost paste-like, but because of their flow properties can physically still be classified as liquids.<br>
5<br>
The aqueous liquid abrasive cleaning compositions according to the invention comprise 10-80% of a calcite and/or dolomite abrasive, 0.05-1.5% of a polycarboxylate thickening polymer with a high carboxylate group content and a<br>
10  stabilising amount of a phosphate or phosphonate capable of sequestering Ca2+  ions.<br>
Abrasive<br>
15<br>
A dispersed, suspended solid particulate abrasive is an essential ingredient of the liquid abrasive compositions according to the present invention. Preferably the amount of abrasive is at least 20% and for practical purposes generally<br>
20  not more than 75%, more preferably at most 70<br>
The products may be formulated and packaged as ready-to-use compositions having an abrasive content as specified above. Such compositions may have the form of thick, viscous, almost<br>
25  paste-like products, or they may have the form of easily<br>
pourable liquids, which can easily be dispensed from a bottle with a relatively narrow opening and are similar in appearance to the products presently well known in the trade as "liquid abrasive cleaners" (LAC).  The thick-viscous type<br>
30  of ready-to-use products preferably have a high abrasives<br>
content of at least 45%, more preferably more than 50%, even<br><br>
WO 03/031554<br><br>
PCT/EP02/11063<br><br>
more preferably at least 55%, most preferably at least 60%. The pourable liquid type of ready-to-use compositions, on the other hand, preferably have a low abrasives content i.e. below 55%, more preferably 50% or less, even more preferably 5  at most 45%.<br>
Alternatively the compositions of the invention may be formulated and packaged as concentrates that are diluted before use by the addition of a suitable amount of water.<br>
10  Such compositions have the advantage that they require<br>
smaller packaging for the same ultimate amount of ready-to-use product and thus provide an advantage in storage and transport. They may be prepared and transported in bulk as intermediates to a production facility close to the consumers<br>
15  where they are diluted with water and then packaged and sold as ready-to-use products. On the other hand, they may also be packaged directly and sold as concentrates, to be diluted with water by the consumer at home. These products have a high abrasives content of preferably at least 45%, more<br>
20  preferably more than 50%, even more preferably at least 55%, most preferably at least 60%.<br>
Calcite and dolomite are the abrasives that are most widely used in the art and the invention specifically pertains to 25  the use of these abrasives.<br>
Preferred weight average particle sizes for the abrasives fall in the range 0.5-500 microns, preferably 5-250 microns, with values of 10-100 microns being particularly preferred. 30  In this range an acceptable compromise between good cleaning behaviour and low substrate damage is achieved.<br><br>
WO 03/031554<br><br>
PCT/EP02/11063<br><br>
The polycarboxylate thickening polymers with a high carboxylate group content are used for obtaining a stable suspension of the abrasive particles in the aqueous medium.<br>
5  Polymer<br>
For the purposes of this invention polycarboxylate thickening polymer with a high carboxylate group content (high carboxylate polymers) are defined as polymers in which<br>
10  at least 50% of the monomeric units in the polymer carry a carboxylic acid or carboxylate ion group, herein collectively referred to as carboxylate group. Preferably the amount of monomers carrying a carboxylate group in the polymer (hereinafter referred to as "carboxylate group<br>
15  content") is at least 70%, more preferably at least 80% or even 90%. The polymers are preferably cross-linked. These polymers are available in various forms and from many suppliers, e.g. as aqueous suspensions or in solid powdered form.<br>
20<br>
A suitable way of determining the carboxylate group content is to determine the acid value of the polymer by titrating with NaOH. It was found that polymers which on the one hand give satifactory rheology, and on the other hand benefit<br>
25  from the addition of phosphate or phosphonate to increase<br>
freeze/thaw stability generally have an acid value of 250 or higher (measured as mg NaOH to titrate lg of polymer to pH 10), preferably &gt;350, more preferably &gt; 425 or even &gt; 475.<br>
          30 The polymers preferably have a molecular weight of at least 100,000. Suitable polymers are to be found among the various<br><br>
WO 03/031554<br><br>
PCT/EP02/11063<br><br>
acrylic, methacrylic and maleic acid homopolymers and copolymers with each other or with other ethylenic monomers (such as acrylate esters). Such polymers generally have a molecular weight of at least 200,000 or even 500,000 or 5  more, often well over 1000,000. Very suitable are synthetic polycarboxylate polymers e.g. carbomers (solid powdered polyacrylic acids).<br>
Polymers for use according to the invention include: 10  POLYGEL/NEUTRAGEL series DA, DS, DR and DB;<br>
CARBOPOL series ETD 2690, ETD 2691, ETD 2623, EZ-1, EZ-2, CARBOPOL 600 series (e.g. 663, 644, 674, 676).<br>
Well-known thickening polymers that are not according to the 15  invention are e.g.:<br>
ACUSOL HASE and ASE series such as 820, 823 and 842;<br>
ACUSOL is a trademark of Rohm &amp; Haas; CARBOPOL is a trademark of Noveon Inc. 20  POLYGEL and NEUTRAGEL are trademarks of Sigma 3V.<br>
The amount of polymer is preferably between 0.07 and 1.0% For "high abrasives content" products, i.e. products in which the amount of abrasive is at least 45%, more preferably<br>
25  more than 50%, even more preferably at least 55%, most<br>
. preferably at least. 60%, the polymers are preferably used in an amount of at least 0.10, more preferably 0.15% or more. For those products the maximum level of polymers generally does not need to exceed 0.70% and is preferably at or below<br>
30  0.65, more preferably at most 0.60, most preferably at most 0.55% or even 0.50%.<br><br>
WO 03/031554<br><br>
PCT7EP02/11063<br><br>
For the easy flowing ready-to-use products, on the other hand, the amount of polymer is preferably at least 0.10%, but the maximum level is preferably less than 0.50%, more preferably at most 0.40% or even 0.35%, most preferably at 5  or below 0.30 or even 0.25%.<br>
Other thickening agents, such as thickening clays or thickening silica are not necessary to achieve the required suspension stability and preferred embodiments of the 10  invention do not contain such thickeners.<br>
Phosphate or phosphonate<br>
The phosphate and/or phosphonate capable of sequestering Ca2+<br>
15  ions may be an inorganic phosphate such as an alkali metal orthophosphate, polyphosphate or pyrophosphate, particularly sodium or potassium tripolyphosphate, or an organic phosphonate such as are marketed by Monsanto in the Dequest™ range. The inorganic phosphates are preferred.<br>
20<br>
The phosphate/phosphonate is used in the LAC in an amount effective to provide sufficient stability to the composition, but not exceeding the solubility in the aqueous phase. Thus, the amount is dependent on the type and amount<br>
25  of carboxylate polymer, on the kind of phosphate or<br>
phosphonate used and on the stability requirements, i.e. the freezing temperature and the number of freeze/thaw cycles the product should be able to withstand. These conditions' are all easily determinable in standard laboratory<br>
30  freeze/thaw test procedures. An amount of at least 0.005% in the composition is preferred, more preferably at least<br><br>
WO 03/031554<br><br>
PCT/EP02/11063<br><br>
0.01%, whereas an amount of more than 5% is not normally advantageous. Preferably the amount is at most 1%, more preferably 0.5% or less. In general satisfactory results are obtained with a polymer:phosphate (or phosphonate) ratio 5  between 20:1 and 1:1, preferably at most 10:1 and at-least 1.5:1 or even 2:1.<br>
The use of inorganic phosphates further improves easy dilution and dispersion of concentrates intended to be 10  diluted to obtain ready-to-use products.<br>
Optional components<br>
15  As outlined above, no surfactant is needed in the<br>
compositions according to the invention for stability reasons. Nevertheless, it may be useful to add a limited amount of detergent surfactant to improve the cleaning properties of the products on certain types of soils and/or<br>
20  to give foaming during use which is desired by many<br>
consumers. Nonionic, anionic, zwitterionic and amphoteric surfactants may be used. Nonionic surfactants are preferred, but they may be combined with other classes of surfactants, particularly anionic surfactants. Generally, the presence of<br>
25  zwitterionic or cationic surfactants, although possible, does not serve any useful purpose and compositions without such surfactants are a preferred embodiment of the invention.<br>
Suitable nonionic surfactants can be broadly described as <br>
compounds produced by the condensation of alkylene oxides<br>
   that are hydrophilic with an organic hydrophobic compound<br><br>
WO 03/031554<br><br>
PCT/EP02/11063<br><br>
that may be aliphatic or alkylaromatic. The length of the hydrophilic polyalkyleneoxy group that is condensed with any particular hydrophobic group can be readily adjusted to yield a water-soluble compound having the desired degree of 5  balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic elements.-<br>
Particular examples include the condensation products of aliphatic alcohols having from 8 to 22 carbon atoms in either straight or branched chain configuration with<br>
10  ethylene oxide, such as a coconut alcohol/ethylene oxide condensate having from 2 to 15 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of coconut alcohol; condensates of alkylphenols, whose alkyl groups contain from 6 to 12 carbon atoms, with 5 to 25 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alkylphenol; condensates<br>
15  of the reaction product of ethylenediamine and propylene<br>
oxide with ethylene oxide, the condensate containing from 40 to 80% of ethyleneoxy groups by weight and having a molecular weight of from 5,000 to 11,000; tertiary amine oxides of structure R3NO, where one group R is an alkyl group<br>
20  of 8 to 18 carbon atoms and the others are each methyl, ethyl or hydroxyethyl .groups"; for instance dimethyl-dodecylamine oxide; tertiary phosphine oxides of structure R3P0, where one group R is an alkyl group of from 10 to 18 carbon atoms, and the others are each alkyl or hydroxyalkyl<br>
25  groups of 1 to 3 carbon atoms, for instance dimethyl-<br>
dodecylphosphine oxide; and dialkyl sulphoxides of structure-R2SO where the group R is an alkyl group of from 10 to 18 carbon atoms and the other is methyl or ethyl, for instance methyl-tetradecyl sulphoxide; fatty acid alkylolamides;<br>
30  alkylene oxide condensates of fatty acid alkylolamides and<br><br>
WO 03/031554<br><br>
PCT/EP02/11063<br><br>
alkyl mercaptans. The nonionic can also be selected from a range of alkyl polyglycosides.<br>
Particularly suitable are the ethoxylated aliphatic alcohol 5  surfactants, such as C9-C11 5EO, C12-C13 6.5EO and C13-C15 7EO (EO numbers are averages) , and the tertiary amine oxides such as dimethyl-decyl-, dimethyl dodecyl- and dimethyl tetradecylamine oxide and amine oxide mixtures containing a large proportion of one or more of these. 10<br>
Suitable anionic surfactants are water-soluble salts of organic sulphuric acid esters and of sulphonic acids which have in the molecular structure an alkyl group containing 6-22 C-atoms. They are usefully added to provide the 15  compositions with good foaming properties, which are often considered desirable by the consumer.<br>
Examples of such anionic surfactants are water-soluble salts of: 20  -   long chain (i.e. 8-22 C-atom) alcohol sulphates (also referred to as PAS) , especially those obtained by sulphating the fatty alcohols produced by reducing the glycerides of tallow or coconut oil; alkylbenzene sulphonates, such as those in which the 25      alkyl group contains from 6 to 20 carbon atoms (also referred to as LAS) ;<br>
secondary alkane sulphonates (also referred to as SAS). Also suitable are salts of:<br>
alkyl glyceryl ether sulphates, especially those ethers 30      of the fatty alcohols derived from tallow and coconut oil;<br><br>
WO 03/031554<br><br>
PCT/EP02/11063<br><br>
fatty acid monoglyceride sulphates;<br>
sulphates of the reaction product of one mole of a fatty alcohol and from 1 to 6 moles of ethylene oxide (also referred to as LES) ; 5  -   salts of alkylphenol ethyleneoxy-ether sulphates with<br>
from 1 to 8 ethyleneoxy units per molecule and in which the alkyl groups contain from 4 to 14 carbon atoms; and mixtures thereof.<br>
10  The preferred water-soluble synthetic anionic surfactants are the sodium, potassium, magnesium and ammonium salts of alkyl-benzene sulphonates, olefin sulphonates and alkyl sulphates, and the fatty acid mono-glyceride sulphates.<br>
15  Amphoteric surfactants that optionally can be employed are derivatives of aliphatic secondary and tertiary amines containing an alkyl group of 8 to 18 carbon atoms and an aliphatic group substituted by an anionic water-solubilising group, for instance sodium 3-dodecylamino-propionate, sodium<br>
20  3-dodecylaminopropane sulphonate and sodium N-2-hydroxydodecyl-N- methyltautratre.<br>
Further examples of suitable surfactants are compounds commonly used as surface-active agents mentioned in the well-<br>
25  known textbooks: "Surface Active Agents" Vol.1, by<br>
Schwartz &amp;.Perry, Interscience 1949; "Surface Active Agents" Vol.2 by Schwartz, Perry &amp; Berch, Interscience 1958; the current edition of "McCutcheon's Emulsifiers and Detergents" published by Manufacturing Confectioners Company; "Tenside-<br>
30  Taschenbuch", H. Stache, 2nd Edn. Carl Hauser Verlag, 1981.<br><br>
WO 03/031554<br><br>
PCT/EP02/11063<br><br>
The compositions according to the invention may contain a total amount of 0-2% of surfactant, preferably at most 1.0%. More preferably the total level of surfactant does not exceed 0.6%. For a useful increase in cleaning and/or foaming<br>
5  properties a minimum level of 0.01% of total surfactant is advisable, preferably at least 0.02%, more preferably at least 0.05%, or even 0.1%. However, surfactant is generally not present in a sufficient amount to provide a structuring system capable of suspending the abrasive.<br>
10<br>
The level of nonionic surfactant should preferably be below 2.0%, more preferably be at or below 1.0% and most preferably at or below 0.60% or even at or below 0.50%. To improve the cleaning properties of the composition the level of nonionic<br>
15  is preferably at least 0.01%, more preferably at least 0.02%.<br>
The compositions according to the invention are alkaline, more particularly they have pH above 8, preferably 9 or higher. Thus the compositions can be made alkaline with use<br>
20  of a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide or<br>
carbonate, ammonia or"an organic base with pKa above 9 such as triethylamine, amino-methylpropanol (AMP), aminobutanol, mono-, di- or tri-ethanolamine, monoisopropylamine or aminomethylpropanediol. AMP is particularly useful, and<br>
25  preferably if added in an amount of up to 1.0%, more<br>
preferably 0.2-0.7% in the absence of another base or 0.1-0.5% in the presence of another base.<br>
The compositions according to the invention generally do not 30  need any extra electrolyte other than the phosphate/<br>
phosphonate, the base for setting the pH and the optional<br><br>
WO 03/031554<br><br>
PCT/EP02/11063<br><br>
anionic surfactant. Preferably the level of additional electrolyte is below 0.3%, more preferably below 0.2%.<br>
The abrasive compositions according to the invention may 5  contain further optional components which improve their<br>
cleaning properties such as organic solvents known in the art for use in abrasive cleaning compositions, particularly solvents of which the molecules bear a polar group, such as C1-C6 alkanols (e.g. hexanol), (di)ethylene- and 10  (di)propylene glycol C1-C6 alkyl ethers, etc. Preferably the compositions do not contain hydrocarbon solvents apart from those which may be present in a perfume.<br>
The compositions may also contain bleaching agents, 15  particularly halogen bleaching agents such as hypochlorite, chlorocyanurates or chlorohydantoins, more particularly hypochlorite, provided that chlorine-stable polymers and surfactants are used.<br>
20  Furthermore they may contain additional components such as: components to further increase their appeal to the consumer, such as colorants, optical brighteners and perfumes; preservatives to prevent microbial contamination.<br>

Liquid properties<br>
Satisfactory "low abrasives content" ready-to-use LAC's 30  according to the invention have such liquid flow<br>
characteristics that they are stable suspensions when not in<br><br>
WO 03/031554<br><br>
PCT/EP02/11063<br><br>
use, but thin enough to pour the liquid from the packaging container and spread it on the soiled surface without appearing thin and watery. Thus, the liquid product preferably has the following liquid flow properties: 5  - no is at least 2000Pa .s<br>
-	oc is 2.5-25;<br>
-	n21 is at least O.lPa.s;<br>
wherein: n0 is the viscosity at zero shear rate (determined by extrapolation); oc is the shear stress at which the viscosity 10  is 0.1.n0; and n21is the viscosity at a shear rate of 21 s-1 Preferably n0 is at least 5000Pa.s, more preferably at least 20,OOOPa.s. Also, preferably n21 is 0.3-5.0, more preferably 0.6-1.8, most preferably 1.0-1.5Pa.s.<br>
15  Measurements made on:<br>
-	CSL 100 (TA Instruments) with vane and basket measuring<br>
system (basket internal diameter 48mm, vane diameter 38mm and<br>
height 24.5mm) to measure viscosity from a stress (a) of 0.01<br>
Pa to the stress required to give a shear rate of 1 s-1<br>
20  - Haake RV20 with M5 measuring head and SV2p measuring<br>
geometry to measure viscosity between shear rates of 0.1 and<br>
389 s-1.<br>
All measurements made at 20°C.<br>
25  Satisfactory "high abrasives content" concentrated liquid abrasive cleaning compositions are liquids or pastes which are suitable for dilution with water to 1.2-4 times, preferably 1.5-3 times, more preferably 2-3 times the original volume, thereby producing a stable ready-to-use<br><br>
WO 03/031554<br><br>
PCT/EP02/11063<br><br>
liquid abrasive cleaning composition, preferably a cleaning composition with the liquid flow properties specified above.<br>
Satisfactory "high abrasives content" ready-to-use liquid 5  abrasive cleaning compositions are generally viscous, or almost paste-like liquids. Although they do not generally spread easily when put on  a surface, they do obtain a smooth and "undisturbed" surface again when left alone for a few minutes to a few hours in the container. Such products are 10  preferably not packaged in a container from which they have to be dispensed by pouring, however, containers such as a tub or tin, from which suitable amounts can be taken out on a suitable applicator such as a wet cloth or sponge, or containers from which they can be dispensed by squeezing, 15  such as a tube, are very useful.<br>
Preparation<br>
20  The compositions according to the invention may simply be<br>
prepared by mixing the various components. One preferred way is to first make a dilute (e.g. 1-2%) aqueous solution or dispersion of the polymer and then mix in the other components subsequently. The other components may be first<br>
25  made into a slurry with the remaining amount of water after which the solution (dispersion) and the slurry are mixed. Sometimes it is advantageous to neutralise the aqueous polymer solution with part of the base before mixing it with the other components.<br>
30<br><br>
WO 03/031554	PCT/EP02/11063<br>
The products according to the invention may also be prepared by adding a pre-prepared dry mix of all the ingredients to the required amount of water, followed by shaking or stirring. The mix may be in powder, granule, prill or any<br>
5  other form suitable for easy dispersion in water. Powders, granules or prills should preferably be free flowing. Spray-drying, fluid bed drying, granulation and similar processes known in the art are very suitable to obtain products, which are free flowing and easily dispersible without lumping.<br>
10  Layering agents may be added to prevent lumping of the dry<br>
composition (examples: Alusil ET, a porous aluminium silicate marketed by J. Crosfield, and Socal P2V, marketed by Solvay). For granulation the addition of a granulating aid such as a polyethelene glycol with mol. weight of 1500-4000 may be<br>
15  useful.<br><br>
WO 03/031554<br><br>
PCT/EP02/11063<br><br>
Examples 1-3<br>
Liquid abrasive cleaning compositions according to the Examples 1-3 in the table below were prepared.<br><br>
Ingredients	Percentage levels<br>
	1	2	3<br>
Dodecyl-dimethyl amine oxide	0.20	0.20	0.20<br>
Calcite (Omyacarb™ 30)	45.00	45.00	45.00<br>
Polygel DR	0.17	0.17	0.17<br>
NaOH	0.048	0.048	0.048<br>
2 -Amino-2 -methyl propanol	0.18	0.18	0.18<br>
Na tripolyphosphate	0.00	0.02	0.05<br>
Perfume	0.40	0.40	0.40<br>
Water	to 100	to 100	to 100<br>
The compositions were prepared by first preparing a solution of the polymer and neutralising it with NaOH solution.<br>
10  Preferably the tripolyphosphate is added to the polymer solution although it could be post-dosed. The polymer solution is stirred at room temperature until it appears homogeneous, while taking care that the solution is not aerated. The remaining components and the remainder of the<br>
15  water of the formula are made into an aqueous slurry and the polymer solution is. carefully added while stirring. Stirring is continued until a homogeneous suspension is obtained, again taking care that aeration is avoided.<br><br>
WO 03/031554<br><br>
PCT/EP02/11063<br><br>
All three examples were tested for stability by subjecting eight samples of each of them to repeated freeze/thaw cycles at -5°, -10° and -24°C.  The -5°C cycle consisted of 18 hours freezing and 6 hours at room temperature; the -10° and -24°C<br>
5  cycles consisted of 16 hours freezing and 8 hours at room temperature. For example 1 six samples were unstable after one -5° cycle and all of them were unstable and sedimented after one -10° or after one -24° cycle. For example 2 two samples showed some signs of separation after eight -5°<br>
10  cycles, which disappeared again after storage at room<br>
temperature. All of the samples survived eighteen -5° cycles or seven -10° or -24° cycles. For example 3 all samples survived eighteen -5° cycles or seven -10° or -24° cycles without any sign of instability.<br>
15<br><br>
WO 03/031554<br><br>
PCT/EP02/11063<br><br>
Example  4<br>
A high calcite content liquid abrasive cleaning composition suitable for use as such or for dilution to a 30-35% calcite 5  LAC was prepared according to the table below.<br><br>
Polygel DB	0.42%<br>
NaOH	0.103%<br>
Amino-2-methyl-2-propanol	0.381%<br>
Calcite (Omyacarb 65)	63.91%<br>
Dodecyl-dimethyl amine oxide	0.32%<br>
Na tripolyphosphate	0.21%<br>
Perfume	0.48%<br>
Proxel GXL (preservative)	0.026%<br>
water	To 100%<br>
The product was prepared by making a dry premix of calcite and dry polymer. This premix was dispersed in a solution of 10  the tripolyphosphate in the water taking care that aeration is avoided. Subsequently, the NaOH, the AMP, the perfume, the amine oxide and the preservative were added.<br>
For cleaning the resulting paste-like product could be used 15  as such, taken from a tub with a wet cloth or it could first be diluted to a creamy pourable liquid. In both forms it was stable through repeated freeze/thaw cycles.<br><br>
