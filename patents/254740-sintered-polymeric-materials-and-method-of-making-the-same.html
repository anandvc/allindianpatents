FIELD. OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to sintered polymeric materials and methods<br>
of making and using the same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Tips or nibs used in applicators, such as highlighters, pens, cosmetic applicators, and<br>
medicament applicators, are typically constructed of felt or thermoplastic fibrous materials<br>
including nylon, acrylic, and polyester fibers. Tips or nibs constructed of these materials<br>
have good mechanical strength, increasing their resistance to fracture. Moreover, such tips or<br>
nibs demonstrate good flow properties of various liquids and have high flexibilities making<br>
them suited for use in marking, writing, and other applications.<br>
Several disadvantages, however, exist with felt and fibrous nibs. One disadvantage is<br>
the difficulty encountered in producing felt and fibrous nibs having relatively complicated<br>
shapes required by various applications. A related disadvantage is that felt and fibrous nibs<br>
cannot be produced in a single step. Multi-step production increases costs and places<br>
limitations on the various designs felt and fibrous nibs can assume. A farther disadvantage is<br>
realized upon use of felt and fibrous nibs. Felt and fibrous materials can become frayed and<br>
dissociate over the hfe of the nib. Similarly, fibers can dissolve in the solvent of inks leading<br>
to weakening of the nib and further contributing to fraying.<br>
Furthermore, the performance characteristics of applicators comprising felt and<br>
fibrous nibs suffer with the deterioration of the felt and fibrous materials. Fraying and other<br>
dissociative processes can drastically affect the fineness of an applicator making use thereof<br>
difficult and frustrating. Additionally, dissolution of fibers in ink solvents can further<br>
complicate matters by leading to excessive ink loss and bleeding.<br><br>
In view of the foregoing problems and disadvantages, it would be desirable to provide<br>
materials demonstrating advantageous mechanical and chemical properties operable to be<br>
used as applicators.<br>
Additionally, porous polymeric materials find application and play critical roles in<br>
numerous fields. Porous polymeric materials have been widely used in filtration and fluid<br>
barrier applications. Current filtration devices often comprise a housing with a polymeric<br>
filtration medium disposed in fluid passageways through the housing. As fluid enters the<br>
housing, it passes through the filtration medium to remove compositions from the fluid<br>
stream. Fluids, as used herein, refer to gases, liquids, or combinations thereof. The efficacy<br>
of a filtration device depends on several factors including the ability of the filtration medium<br>
to maintain a sufficient seal with the housing to prevent fluid from circumventing the<br>
filtration medium.<br>
Fluid circumventing the filtration medium causes significant problems, especially<br>
when the filtration medium also serves as a barrier to selected fluids, such as aqueous<br>
solutions. Fluid circumventing the filtration medium can contaminate downstream apparatus<br>
and processes leading to inconvenience, corrosion and costly repairs of equipment. Pipette<br>
devices, for example, often comprise a filtration or barrier medium which allows the passage<br>
of fluids such as gasses but prevents the passage of liquids which can contaminate the pipette.<br>
Contamination of a pipette by fluids circumventing or bypassing the filtration or barrier<br>
medium often requires destruction or decontamination of the pipette due to the potential for<br>
subsequent contamination of other solutions.<br>
One disadvantage of present porous polymeric filtration and barrier media is their<br>
rigid nature making it difficult to form sufficient seals with housings. This is especially true<br>
when either or both the housing and filtration medium have defects resulting from<br>
manufacturing or assembly processes. Precise tolerances must therefore be maintained in<br>
producing filters comprising filtration media disposed in housings. The requirement of<br>
precise tolerances often results in the rejection of a significant amount of product in addition<br>
to the potential for the filtration medium to fall out of the housing or otherwise assume an<br>
incorrect position within the housing.<br>
In view of the foregoing problems, it would be desirable to provide filtration and<br>
barrier media operable to form sufficient seals with housings to prevent fluid bypass without<br>
being subjected to the precise tolerances required by present filtration apparatus.<br><br><br>

using the same. Filtration media, according to embodiments of the present invention, are<br>
operable to pass liquids and gases to filter contaminants or other desired species in the liquids<br>
or gases. When a liquid or gas flows through a filtration medium of the present invention,<br>
contaminants or other desired species, such as target molecules or substances, become<br>
associated with the filtration medium and are removed from the liquid or gas.<br>
Barrier media, according to some embodiments of the present invention, however,<br>

pipetted fluid from contaminating the pipettor.<br>
Filtration and barrier media comprising sintered polymeric materials of the present<br>
invention can form sufficient seals with housings to prevent fluid circumventing the media<br>
without being subjected to the precise tolerances often required by filtration apparatus.<br>
Filtration and barrier media comprising sintered porous polymeric materials of the present<br>
invention can demonstrate flexible properties allowing the media to conform to variations and<br>
inconsistencies in surfaces of the housing thereby facilitating sufficient sealing with the<br>
housing and reducing product failure and discardment due to fluid bypass. Moreover, the<br>
flexible properties of filtration and barrier media of the present invention can permit the<br>
porosity of the media to be adjusted according to various applications.<br>

solutions, such as water or other aqueous solutions, but do not dissolve in the solutions. The<br>
swelling of the super-absorbent material, in some embodiments, can seal the barrier medium<br>
preventing further flow of fluids through the barrier medium. In other embodiments, a barrier<br>
medium comprising a sintered porous polymeric material comprising at least one plastic and<br>
at least one elastomer does not include a super-absorbent material.<br>
In a further embodiment, a barrier medium comprising a sintered porous polymeric<br>
material comprising at least one plastic and at least one elastomer further comprises a<br>

A housing, in some embodiments of the present invention, comprises a pipette tip, a<br>
chromatographic column such as those used in liquid chromatography, a vacuum filtration<br>
housing, a funnel, a tube, a syringe, a catheter, a duct, or combinations thereof. In some<br>

fit any type or brand of pipettor. In one embodiment, a housing comprises a tubular housing<br>
as described in United States Patent No. 5,259,956. In some embodiments, a housing<br>
comprises a tube wherein the filtration medium serves as an in-line filter operable to filter<br>

and/or downstream of the filtration medium to prevent the passage of undesired fluids. In<br>
another embodiment, a housing comprises fluid flow control devices, such as a suction<br>
canister as detailed in PCT Application Publication Number WO 87/00439. In another<br><br><br>

applications, such as those described in United States Patent No. 5,620,427.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates a barrier medium disposed in a pipette tip housing according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. As understood by one of skill in the art, when disposed<br>
in a pipette tip, a barrier medium can serve as a pipette tip filter. The pipette tip (800)<br>
comprises a tapering, hollow tubular member (802) constructed of an inert material such as<br>
glass or plastic and is open at a first end (804) and a second end (806), the first (804) and<br>
second (806) ends are in facing opposition. A barrier medium (808) comprising a sintered<br>
porous polymeric material comprising at least one elastomer, at least one plastic, and<br>
optionally at least one super-absorbent material is disposed in the tubular member (802) to<br>
define a liquid sample chamber (810) between the barrier medium (808) and second end<br>
(806). The barrier medium (808) is additionally spaced from the first end (804) of the tubular<br>
member (802) to define a chamber (811) between the barrier medium (808) and first end<br>
(804)<br>
The first end (804) of the tubular member (802) is releasably secured to a suitable<br>
suction device (812) as known to one of skill in the art. Any suitable suction device for<br>
drawing a predetermined volume of liquid in the chamber (810) can be used, such as a<br>
volumetric pipetter, suction pump, elastic bulb, bellows, etc. The barrier medium (808), in<br>
some embodiments, is force or pressure fitted securely into tubular member (802), under a<br>
sufficient pressure so that it is securely held and frictionally sealed against the inner wall of<br>
tubular member (802) although not attached to the inner wall by any adhesive or other<br>
additional material. The flexible properties of the barrier medium (808) allows for a secure<br>
seal with the wall of the tubular member (802) and can accommodate inconsistencies or<br>
defects along interior surfaces of the tubular member (802) in contact with the filtration<br>
medium (808).<br>
In some embodiments, the flexible region of a filtration or barrier medium is<br>
compressed or otherwise deformed when the medium is disposed in a housing. Compression<br>
or deformation of the flexible region can allow a filtration or barrier medium to fit into a<br>
variety of housings having differing dimensions thereby precluding the need to design and<br>
manufacture a specific filtration or barrier medium for a specific housing. Moreover,<br>
compression of the flexible region can preclude or inhibit deformation of the rigid region of<br>
the filtration or barrier medium. Preventing deformation of the rigid region, in some<br>
embodiments, allows the rigid region to demonstrate a uniform pore structure and porosity.<br>
The filtration medium of Figure 6, for example, comprises a flexible region (602) encircling a<br><br><br>
rigid region (604). When disposed in a housing, the flexible region (602), in some<br>
embodiments, is placed in compression while the rigid region (6.04) remains in an<br>
unperturbed state. In one embodiment, a flexible region of a filtration or barrier medium<br>
serves as a housing sealing component and a rigid region serves as a filtration or barrier<br>
component.<br>

comprises at least one plastic and at least one elastomer. In some embodiments, adjusting the<br>
pores sizes comprises placing the filtration or barrier medium in tension or compression.<br>
As provided herein, placing a filtration or barrier medium of the present invention in<br>
tension or compression, in some embodiments, results in changes to the pore size and<br>
porosity of the medium. Changes in pore size and porosity, according to some embodiments,<br><br><br>
are used to clean filtration or barrier media of the present invention. Placing a filtration or<br>
barrier medium comprising a sintered porous polymeric material comprising at least one<br>
elastomer and at least one plastic in tension, for example, results in an expansion of pore<br>
sizes. The expansion of pore size, in some embodiments, releases compositions disposed in<br>
the poTes thereby cleaning the filtration or barrier medium.<br>
In another embodiment, a filtration or barrier medium of the present invention is<br>
placed in compression to reduce pore sizes of the filtration medium. The reduction in pore<br>
sizes, in some embodiments, forces out compositions disposed in the pores thereby cleaning<br>
the filtration or barrier medium.<br>
In some embodiments, a filtration or barrier medium of the present invention is cycled<br>
through tension and compression forces during cleaning. A filtration or barrier medium, for<br>
example, can be placed in tension followed by compression or vice versa. The flexible<br>
properties of filtration or barrier media of the present invention reduces the potential failure<br>
of the filtration medium due to the application of tensile and compressive forces.<br>
