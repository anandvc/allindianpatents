				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to compounds that modulate one or more thrombopoietin activity and/or bind to thrombopoietin receptors; and to methods for making and using such compounds.<br>
Background<br>
Thrombopoietin (TPO), also referred to as c-Mpl ligand, mpl ligand, megapoietin, and megakaryocyte growth and development factor, is a glycoprotein that has been shown to be involved in production of platelets. See e.g., Wendling, F., et. al., Biotherapy 10(4):269-77 (1998); Kuter DJ. et al.. The Oncologist, 1:98-106 (1996); and Metcalf, Nature 369: 519-520 (1994). TPO has been cloned and its amino acid sequence and the cDNA sequence encoding it have been described. See e.g., U.S. 5,766,581; Kuter, D.J. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 91:11104-11108 (1994); de Sauvage F.V., et al., Nature, 369: 533-538 (1994); Lok, S. etal.. Nature 369:565-568 (1994); and Wending, F. et al., Nature, 369: 571-574 (1994).<br>
In certain instances, TPO activity results from binding of TPO to the TPO receptor (also called MPL). The TPO receptor has been cloned and its amino acid sequence has been described. See e.g., Vigon et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 89:5640-5644 (1992).<br>
In certain instances, TPO modulators may be useful in treating a variety of hematopoietic conditions, including, but not limited to, thrombocytopenia. See e.g., Baser et al. Blood 89:3118-3128 (1997); Fanucchi et al. New Engl. J. Med. 336:404-409 (1997). For example, patients undergoing certain chemotherapies, including but not limited to chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy for the treatment of cancer, may have reduced platelet levels. In certain instances, treating such patients with a selective TPO modulator increases platelet levels. In certain instances, selective TPO modulators stimulate production of glial cells, which may result in repair of damaged nerve cells.<br>
Certain TPO mimics  have been described previously.     See e.g., WO<br><br>

In certain embodiments, a substantially purified fraction is a composition wherein the object species comprises at least about 50 percent (on a molar basis) of all species present. In certain embodiments, a substantially pure composition will comprise more than about 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99% of all species present in the composition. In certain embodiments, the object species is purified to essential homogeneity (contaminant species cannot be detected in the composition by conventional detection methods) wherein the composition consists essentially of a single species.<br>
The term "tissue-selective" refers to the ability of a compound to modulate a biological activity in one tissue to a greater or lesser degree than it modulates a biological activity in another tissue. The biological activities in the different tissues may be the same or they may be different. The biological activities in the different tissues may be mediated by the same type of target receptor. For example, in certain embodiments, a tissue-selective compound may modulate<br><br>
receptor mediated biological activity in one tissue and fail to modulate, or modulate to a lesser degree, receptor mediated biological activity in another tissue type.<br>
The term "monitoring" refers to observing an effect or absence of any effect. In certain embodiments, one monitors cells after contacting those cells with a compound of the present invention. Examples of effects that may be monitored include, but are not limited to, changes in cell phenotype, cell proliferation, receptor activity, or the interaction between a receptor and a compound known to bind to the receptor.<br>
The term "cell phenotype" refers to physical or biological characteristics of a cell. Examples of characteristics that constitute phenotype included, but are not limited to, cell size, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell survival, apoptosis (cell death), or the utilization of a metabolic nutrient (e.g., glucose uptake). Certain changes or the absence of changes in cell phenotype are readily monitored using techniques known in the art.<br>
The term "cell proliferation" refers to the rate at which cells divide. In certain embodiments, cells are in situ in an organism. In certain, embodiments, cell are grown in vitro in a vessel. The number of cells growing in a vessel can be quantified by a person skilled in the art (e.g., by counting cells in a defined area using a microscope or by using laboratory apparatus that measure the density of cells in an appropriate medium). One skilled in that art can calculate cell proliferation by determining the number of cells at two or more times.<br>
The term "contacting" refers to bringing two or more materials into close enough proximity that they may interact. In certain embodiments, contacting can be accomplished in a vessel such as a test tube, a petri dish, or the like. In certain embodiments, contacting may be performed in the presence of additional materials. In certain embodiments, contacting may be performed in the presence of cells. In certain of such embodiments, one or more of the materials that are being contacted may be inside a cell. Cells may be alive or may dead. Cells may or may not be intact.<br>

In embodiments in which two or more of a particular group are present, the identities of those two or more particular groups are selected independently and, thus, may be the same or different from one another. For example, certain compounds of the invention comprise two or more R14 groups. The identities of those two or more R14 groups are each selected independently. Thus, .in certain embodiments, those R14 groups are all the same as one another; in certain embodiments, those Rw groups are all different from one another, and in certain embodiments, some of those R14 groups are the same as one another and some are different from one another. This independent selection applies to any group that is present in a compound more than once.<br>
One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the complete lists of possible identities for each above-listed group (all R groups, Y, Q, Z, m, and n) may be narrowed to provide shorter lists of possible identities. For example, since in certain embodiments R1 is selected from hydrogen, CO2R.W, CONR'Â°R", SO2R10, and a carboxylic acid bioisostere, it is to be understood that in certain embodiments, R1 may be selected from COjR10, CONR"R11, and SO3R10, because each of those possible identities is included on the longer list of possible identities. One of ordinary skill in the art will also recognize that broader terms include combinations of narrower terms, which may be substituted and selected.  For example, in certain embodiments, R2 is selected from an<br>
optionally substituted C1-C4 aliphatic. Because aliphatics include, but are not limited to, alkyls and alkenes, in certain embodiments, R2 may be selected from an optionally substituted  C1-C4  alkyl and an optionally substituted  C1-C4  alkenyl. Similarly, in certain embodiments, R3 is selected from an optionally substituted C2-C3 alkyl and an optionally substituted C2-C4 alkenyl, because those alkyls and alkenyls are included in the definition of C1-C4 aliphatics.<br>
One of ordinary skill in the art will also understand that the above listed groups may be selected in any combination. For example, in certain embodiments, R1 is selected from hydrogen, CO2R10, CONR10R!1, S03R10, and a carboxylic acid bioisostere; and R2 is selected from hydrogen, OR12, NRUR13, an optionally substituted  C1-C4 aliphatic, an optionally substituted  C1-C4 haloaliphatic, an optionally substituted  C1-C4 heteroaliphatic, (CH2)mR14, an optionally substituted ring, and null. Therefore, in certain embodiments, R1 may be selected from hydrogen, and CO2R10; and at the same time R2 may be selected from hydrogen, OR12, NR12R13, and an optionally substituted  C1-C4 aliphatic, because those lists of possible identities are included within the previous lists of possible identities. Such selection of combinations are included for all groups herein.<br>

In certain embodiments, the present invention provides any single compound selected from any of the above lists of compounds. In certain embodiments, the present invention provides any number and any combination of compounds selected from the above lists of compounds.<br>
Certain compounds of the present inventions may exist as stereoisomers including optical isomers. The present disclosure is intended to include all stereoisomers and both the racemic mixtures of such stereoisomers as well as the individual enantiomers that may be separated according to methods that are known in the art or that may be excluded by synthesis schemes known in the art designed to yield predominantly one enantomer relative to another.<br><br>
Certain Synthesis Methods<br>
In certain embodiments, certain compounds of the present invention can by synthesized using the following Schemes.<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The process of Scheme I is a multi-step synthetic sequence that commences with the palladium catalyzed cross-coupling of a phenylboronic acid such as structure 2 and an aryl bromide such as structure 1 to form the biaryl structure 3. Deprotection of the methyl ether is followed by nitration and hydrogenation to give the biphenyl amino acid such as structure 4. The amino group is then diazotized under standard conditions and is treated with the appropriate coupling partner to give the final product of structure 6.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The process of Scheme n is a multi-step synthetic sequence that commences with the copper catalyzed cross-coupling of an oxindole such as structure 7 and an aryl or alkyl bromide to provide an N-substituted oxindole of structure 8. This is then followed by coupling the N-substituted oxindole with the diazonium salt of the biphenyl amino acid such as structure 4 to give the final product of structure 9.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The process of Scheme III is a multi-step synthetic sequence that commences with the reductive amination of an aniline such as structure 10 with a benzaldehyde and conversion into the chloroacetanilide of structure 11 with chloroacetyl chloride. Palladium catalyzed ring closure gives the N-benzyl oxindole such as structure 12, which is then coupled to the diazonium salt of the biphenyl amino acid of structure 4 to give the final product of structure 9.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The process of Scheme IV is a multi-step synthetic sequence that commences with the conversion of an amine of structure 13 into an N-aryl rhodanine of structure 14 with bis(carboxymethyl) trithiocarbonate. The rhodanine is then coupled to the diazonium salt of the biphenyl amino acid such as structure 4 to give the final product of structure 15.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
In Scheme V, a hyrdoxynitrobenzaldehyde such as structure 16 is converted into either a cinnamate such as structure 17 or thiazolidinedione derivative of structure 19. The requisite nitro-group is reduced and then converted into a diazonium salt and coupled to the corresponding N-aryl oxindole of structure 8 to give the final compound of structure 20.<br>

Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art.<br>
In certain embodiments, one or more compounds of the present invention is formulated as a prodrug. In certain embodiments, upon in vivo administration, a prodrug is chemically converted to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically more active form of the compound. In certain embodiments, prodrugs are useful because they are easier to administer than the corresponding active form. For example, in certain instances, a prodrug may be more bioavailable (e.g., through oral administration) than is the corresponding active form, hi certain instances, a prodrug may have improved solubility compared to the corresponding active form. hi certain embodiments, prodrugs are less water soluble ttian the corresponding active form. In certain instances, such prodrugs possess superior transmittal a.cross cell membranes, where water solubility is detrimental to mobility. In certain embodiments, a prodrug is an ester, hi certain such embodiments, the ester is metabolically hydrolyzed to carboxylic acid upon administration. In certain instances the carboxylic acid containing compound is the corresponding active form, hi<br><br>
certain embodiments, a prodrug comprises a short peptide (polyaminoacid) bound to an acid group. In certain of such embodiments, the peptide is cleaved upon administration to form the corresponding active form.<br>
In certain embodiments, a prodrug is produced by modifying a pharmaceutically active compound such that the active compound will be regenerated upon in vivo administration. The prodrug can be designed to alter the metabolic stability or the transport characteristics of a drug, to mask side effects or toxicity, to improve the flavor of a drug or to alter other characteristics or properties of a drug. By virtue of knowledge of pharmacodynamic processes and drug metabolism in vivo, those of skill in this art, once a pharmaceutically active compound is known, can design prodrugs of the compound (see, eg., Nogrady (1985) Medicinal Chemistry A Biochemical Approach, Oxford University Press, New York, pages 388-392).<br>
