FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to new therapeutic drugs; compositions that include<br>
the new therapeutic drugs; and methods for administering and using the new therapeutic<br>
drugs and compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The ability to administer biologically effective drugs that are poorly soluble in<br>
biocompatible solvents to mammals has been a major hurdle in the realm of<br>
pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry. In particular, difficulties arise when an active<br>
drug is either insoluble in water or unstable in other biocompatible solvents.<br>
One way to solubilize medicinal agents is to chemically modify them or conjugate<br>
them to another molecule to alter the solubility profile in a particular solvent. Conjugates<br>
of active drugs, often referred to as prodrugs, include chemical derivatives of<br>
biologically-active parent compounds that are converted into the parent compounds in<br>
vivo. The release of the active parent drug from the prodrug conjugate may occur as the<br>
result of processes such as hydrolysis or enzymatic cleavage. The rate of release is<br>
influenced by several factors, including the type of chemical bond joining the active<br>
parent drug to the conjugate moiety.<br>
Incorporating a water-soluble moiety (e.g., polyethylene glycol, polyglutamate, or<br>
polymer) to increase solubility and circulation life of a drug has been investigated by<br>
others. The use of fatty acids to conjugate to active drugs for purposes of tumor targeting<br>
has also been investigated as a means of improving therapeutic index.<br>
Many potent drugs, such as camptothecin and its analogues<br>
(e.g., 10-hydroxycamptothecin and 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin), taxanes<br>
(e.g., paclitaxel, docetaxel), candesartan, amphotericin B, azathioprine, cyclosporine,<br>
entacapone, danazol, eletriptan, and bosentan, to name a few, are poorly soluble or have<br>
poor cell permeability. Solubility problems of potential therapeutic agents are common<br>
and often cause delays in drug development. Several technologies have been developed<br>
to facilitate the delivery of poorly soluble and insoluble compounds to patients.<br>
Examples of technologies specifically designed to solve solubility problems include<br>
complexing agents, nanoparticles, microemulsions, solubility enhancing formulations,<br>
prodrugs, and novel polymer systems.<br><br>
Paclitaxel (see structure below), a natural product found in the inner bark of the<br>
Pacific Yew tree, is an example of an important chemotherapeutic agent with wide<br>
spectrum of activity against solid tumors, primarily breast, ovarian, colon and non-small<br>
cell lung cancer.<br><br>
Paclitaxel exerts its antitumor activity by binding to tubulin and stabilizing<br>
microtubules and thus blocking cell mitosis. However, paclitaxel, like many other potent<br>
biologically active molecules, has very limited aqueous solubility.<br>
Camptothecin (CPT) (see structure below) is another example of a poorly soluble<br>
and difficult to formulate anti-cancer drug.<br><br>
CPT is a quinoline-based alkaloid found in the bark of the Chinese camptotheca<br>
tree and the Asian nothapodytes tree. CPT includes four planar rings (ABCD) and one<br>
boat conformational ring (E). CPT has been found to have a broad spectrum of antitumor<br>
activity, especially in human solid tumors. However, the lactone (ring E) of<br>
camptothecin and its derivatives is quite labile in alkaline condition and physiological<br>
pH. The opening of this ring to form an acid salt or carboxylate species results in<br>
significant loss of anticancer activities. Efforts have been made since the early 1960s,<br><br>
when CPT was discovered by Wall and Ward, to improve upon the anti-cancer activities<br>
of camptothecin and its analogues, and to reduce unwanted toxicities. No successful<br>
formulation of camptothecin has been developed to date because of its poor solubility in<br>
both water and organic solvents. However, water-soluble analogues of camptothecin,<br>
irinotecan hydrochloride (CAMPTOSAR) and topotecan hydrochloride (HYCAMPTIN),<br>
have been developed and are the only camptothecin analogs currently approved by the<br>
Food and Drug Administration.<br>
Recently, a vitamin E (a-tocopherol)-based emulsion formulation technology for<br>
paclitaxel drug delivery has been developed. In the formulation, paclitaxel is solubilized<br>
in α-tocopherol and formulated as an oil-in-water emulsion. However, while paclitaxel<br>
is soluble in a-tocopherol, the solubility of other active moieties (including camptothecin<br>
and other taxanes) in a-tocopherol is limited. Therefore, there continues to be a need for<br>
new methods, which are both safe and efficacious, of solubilizing and delivering poorly<br>
soluble active drug molecules.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
In one aspect, the present invention provides therapeutic drug compounds that<br>
have been modified to increase their lipophilicity. The compounds of the invention are<br>
modified therapeutic drugs. The compounds of the invention include a therapeutic drug<br>
moiety and a lipophilic moiety.<br>
In some embodiments, the compounds of the invention include more than one<br>
therapeutic drug moiety. In some embodiments, the compounds of the invention include<br>
more than one lipophilic moiety. In other embodiments, the compounds of the invention<br>
include more than one therapeutic drug moiety and more than one lipophilic moiety.<br>
In some embodiments, the therapeutic drug moiety is covalently coupled to the<br>
lipophilic moiety through a linker moiety. In other embodiments, the therapeutic drug<br>
moiety is directly covalently coupled to the lipophilic moiety without a linker moiety.<br>
In one embodiment, the lipophilic moiety is a tocopherol moiety, and the<br>
compound is a tocopherol-modified therapeutic drug compound. The<br>
tocopherol-modified therapeutic drug compound (or "tocopherolated" therapeutic drug<br><br>
compound) has one or more tocopherol moieties covalently coupled to a therapeutic drug<br>
moiety or a tocopherol moiety covalently coupled to one or more therapeutic drug<br>
moieties. As noted above, the tocopherol moiety is covalently coupled to the therapeutic<br>
drug moiety either directly or through a linker moiety.<br>
In one embodiment, the tocopherol-modified therapeutic drug compounds of the<br>
invention can be represented by the general formula (1):<br><br>
wherein T is a tocopherol moiety (i.e., a representative lipophilic moiety); L is a linker<br>
moiety; n is 0, 1, 2, or 3; m is 0, 1, 2, or 3; n + m is 1, 2, or 3; and D is a therapeutic drug<br>
moiety. In this embodiment, the compound includes n T-L moieties<br>
(i.e., tocopherol-linker moieties) and m tocopherol moieties, with the proviso that n + m<br>
is 1, 2, or 3. Each T-L moiety includes a tocopherol moiety covalently coupled to a linker<br>
moiety. Each of the n T-L moieties is covalently coupled to the therapeutic drug moiety<br>
through the T-L moiety's linker moiety. In this embodiment, each of the m tocopherol<br>
moieties is directly covalently coupled to the therapeutic drug moiety without a linker<br>
moiety.<br>
Representative compounds having formula (1) include those in which n is 0 and m<br>
is 1, 2, or 3. These compounds have the general formula:<br><br>
In this embodiment, one, two, or three tocopherol moieties are directly covalently<br>
coupled to the therapeutic drug moiety.<br>
Representative compounds having formula (1) include those in which m is 0 and<br>
n is 1, 2, or 3. These compounds have the general formula:<br><br>
In this embodiment, one, two, or three T-L moieties are covalently coupled to the<br>
therapeutic drug moiety through the T-L moiety's linker moiety.<br><br>
Representative compounds having formula (1) include those in which m is 1 or 2,<br>
and n is 1 or 2. These compounds have the general formulae:<br><br>
In these embodiments, the compounds of the invention have tocopherol moieties that are<br>
directly covalently coupled to the therapeutic drug moiety without a linker and tocopherol<br>
moieties that are covalently coupled to the therapeutic drug moiety through a linker<br>
(i.e., the T-L moieties).<br>
The compounds of the invention described above include one therapeutic drug<br>
moiety and one or more lipophilic moieties (e.g., tocopherol moieties). In other<br>
embodiments, the compounds of the invention include more than one therapeutic drug<br>
moiety. In one embodiment, the compounds include two therapeutic drug moieties. In<br>
another embodiment, the compounds include three therapeutic drug moieties. For<br>
compounds that include more than one therapeutic drug moiety, the therapeutic drug<br>
moieties a can be the same or different.<br>
For compounds that include more than one therapeutic drug moiety, the<br>
therapeutic drug moieties can be incorporated into the compound in any suitable way. In<br>
some embodiments, the therapeutic drug moieties can be directly covalently coupled<br>
(e.g., the compound includes a -D-D- or -D-D moiety). In other embodiments, the<br>
therapeutic drug moieties are separated in the compound by a linker moiety (e.g., the<br>
compound includes a -D-L-D- or -D-L-D moiety), a lipophilic moiety (e.g., the<br>
compound includes a -D-T-D- or -D-T-D moiety), or a lipophilic-linker moiety (e.g., the<br>
compound includes a -D-T-L-D-, -D-T-L-D, or -D-L-T-D moiety; or a -D-L-T-L-D- or<br>
-D-L-T-L-D moiety).<br>
Representative compounds including two or three therapeutic drug moieties have<br>
the general formula:<br><br><br>
wherein p is 2 or 3. In this embodiment, the two or three therapeutic drug moieties are<br>
Covalently coupled to the linker moiety. In this instance, the linker includes multiple sites<br>
for the attachment of the therapeutic drug compound (or modified therapeutic drug<br>
compound). As is clear from formula (7), the linker moiety is also covalently coupled to<br>
the lipophilic moiety (e.g., tocopherol moiety). As noted above, compounds of the<br>
invention including more than one therapeutic drug moiety can have formulae other than<br>
shown above in formula (7). For example, such a compound can include more than one<br>
(e.g., two or three) lipophilic (e.g., tocopherol) moieties.<br>
The compounds of the invention include one or more lipophilic moieties and one<br>
or more therapeutic drug moieties that are either directly covalently linked or covalently<br>
linked through linker moieties.<br>
As used herein, the term "lipophilic moiety" refers to a chemical moiety having<br>
lipophilic or hydrophobic characteristics and that increases the solubility of a therapeutic<br>
drug compound in a lipophilic solvent or environment when covalently coupled to the<br>
therapeutic drug compound to provide a compound of the invention. A description of<br>
representative lipophilic moieties useful in making the compounds of the invention is <br>
provided below.<br>
As used herein, the term "therapeutic drug moiety" refers to a chemical moiety<br>

represented by the general formula (8):<br><br>
where T is a tocopherol moiety (i.e., a representative lipophilic moiety), D is a therapeutic<br>
drug moiety, and A-R-A' is a linker moiety. It will be appreciated that for formulae<br><br>
(1) and (3)-(7) above, each of which includes linker moiety L, the linker moiety L in<br>
those compounds can be linker moiety A-R-A'.<br>
In formula 8, groups A and A' are independently selected from O, S, SO, SO2,<br>

the above groups, R1 and R2 are independently selected from Na+, K+, H, C1-6 n-alkyl,<br>
C3-12 branched alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted C3-6 cycloalkyl, substituted or<br>
unsubstituted aryl, and substituted or unsubstituted aralkyl.<br>
As used herein, the term "aryl" refers to monocyclic and polycyclic aromatic<br>
compounds having from 6 to 14 carbon or hetero atoms, and includes carbocyclic aryl<br>
groups and heterocyclic aryl groups. Representative aryl groups include phenyl,<br>

Lipophilic Moiety. The compounds of the invention include one or more<br>
lipophilic moieties. The lipophilic moiety or moieties increases the solubility of the<br>
compound in a lipophilic solvent or environment. In one embodiment, the lipophilic<br>

As used herein, the term "tocopherol moiety" refers to a chemical moiety that is<br>
derived from a family of natural or synthetic compounds, also known by their generic<br>
names, tocol or vitamin E. In addition to tocopherol compounds, tocotrienol compounds<br>
are included in this family. These compounds include a chroman head having a phenolic<br><br>
alcohol (C-6) and a phytyl tail (C-2). These compounds have the following general<br>
formula:<br><br>
Tocopherols constitute a series of related benzopyranols (or methyl tocols) in<br>
which the C-2 phytyl (sixteen carbon) side chain is saturated. Representative tocopherols<br>
include a-tocopherol, (d-form, dl-form, l-form), β-tocopherol (d-form, dl-form, I-form),<br>
γ-tocopherol (d-form, dl-form, 1-form), and 8-tocopherol (d-from, dl-form, 1-form).<br>
Among tocopherols, a-tocopherol is the most abundant. Tocotrienols are similar in<br>
structure to tocopherols except that the trienols have three double bonds in the C-2 phytyl<br>
side chain.<br>
Tocopherol and tocotrienol compounds useful in making the compounds of the<br>

include camptothecin and its derivatives including 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin<br>
(SN38) and 10-hydroxycamptothecin, and doxorubicin and its derivatives.<br>
In certain embodiments, the therapeutic drug moiety is derived from paclitaxel,<br>

For compounds of the invention having formula (2) with m = 1, formula (3) with<br>
n = 1, and formula 8, certain compounds are excluded and are not within the scope of the<br>
invention. When the linker moiety is 2-hydroxypropylene (-CH2CH(OH)CH2-), the<br>
therapeutic drug moiety is not an a-amino acid (e.g., glycine, alanine, proline, cysteine,<br>

(e.g.,-glutathione). When the linker moiety is a succinate, the therapeutic drug moiety is<br>
not an S-linked amino or amino acid compound coupled to one of the aliphatic succinate<br>
carbons. When the linker moiety is succinate, the therapeutic drug moiety is not ferulic<br>
acid or an ester thereof.<br>
In another aspect, methods for making the compounds of the invention are<br>
provided. There are many ways to covalently couple a lipophilic compound (e.g., a<br>
tocopherol compound) to a therapeutic drug compound to form a compound of the<br>
invention. In one embodiment, a representative tocopherol, d-α-tocopherol, includes a<br>
hydroxyl group that may be directly coupled with a carboxyl group of a therapeutic drug<br>
to form a tocopherol-modified therapeutic drug compound. The preparation of a<br>
representative tocopherol-modified therapeutic compound of the invention from a<br>
carboxylic acid-containing therapeutic drug compound is illustrated in FIGURE 1.<br>
In another embodiment, a tocopherol may be functionalized at the hydroxyl group<br>
with a reagent to attach an active group such as phosphoric chloride (-P(O)OR1Cl),<br>
phosphonic chloride (-P(O)R1Cl), sulfonic chloride (-SO2Cl), or carbonyl chloride<br>
(-COCl). The resulting acid chloride can then be reacted with an appropriately<br>
functionalized therapeutic drug compound to provide a tocopherol-modified therapeutic<br>
drug compound.<br><br>

3,3-tetramethylene glutaric anhydride, glutaric anhydride, maleic acid anhydride, phthalic<br>
acid anhydride, terephthalic acid, or isophthalic acid to attach a carboxyl group (-COOH).<br>
The resulting carboxyl group may then be directly reacted with an appropriately<br>
functionalized therapeutic drug or the carboxyl group may be converted to a more<br>
reactive carbonyl chloride group (-COCl), and then the carbonyl chloride group may be<br>
coupled with the functional group of the therapeutic drug to form a tocopherol-modified<br>
therapeutic drug compound as illustrated in FIGURE 3. In FIGURE 3, X is O, S, NH, or<br>
C(=O)O.<br>
In another embodiment, a linker can be coupled to the hydroxyl group of a<br>
tocopherol and then a therapeutic drug can be coupled to an accessible functional group<br>
on the linker. The functional group may be, for example, but not limited to, a carboxyl<br>
group (-COOH), a poly(ethylene oxide) group (-(CH2CH2O)n-H), an aldehyde group<br>
(-CHO), an isocyanato group (-N=C=O), a phosphoric acid group (-OPO3H2), or<br>
phosphoric chloride group (-OPO2R1Cl, where R1 is a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl<br>
or cycloalkyl, a substituted or unsubstituted aryl, or an aralkyl), a phosphonic chloride<br>
group (-PO2R1Cl, where R1 is a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl or cycloalkyl, a<br>
substituted or unsubstituted aryl, or an aralkyl), a sulfuric acid group (-OSO3H2), a<br>

invention, optionally one or more additional therapeutic agents, and a lipophilic medium.<br>
In one embodiment, a tocopherol-modified therapeutic drug compound is dissolved in the<br>
lipophilic medium. Because of the lipophilic moiety, the compound has improved<br>
lipophilicity compared to the unmodified therapeutic drug compound. The lipophilic<br>
medium (or carrier) of the composition can be any one of a variety of lipophilic mediums<br>
including, for example, oils. In one embodiment, the lipophilic medium includes a<br>
tocopherol (e.g., a-tocopherol). Representative oils useful as the lipophilic medium<br>

Fatty acids and esters thereof, including carboxylic acids of various chain lengths,<br>
mostly straight chain, but which could be branched, examples of which include capric,<br>
caprylic, caproic, lauric, myristic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, behenic, and as well as saturated<br>
or unsaturated fatty acids and esters;<br>

palmitate), or sugars (sorbitan monooleate, SPAN 80, Tween 80, sucrose laurate);<br>
Fatty alcohols such as stearyl alcohol, lauryl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, or esters or<br>
ethers thereof, such as benzyl benzoate;<br>

tocopherols and tocotrienols, and tocopherol and tocotrienol derivatives, such as vitamin<br>
E succinate, vitamin E acetate, and vitamin E succinate polyethylene glycol (TPGS)).<br><br>
Organic co-solvents can also be used in the compositions, optionally in<br>
combination with water, including for example, ethanol, polyethylene glycol, propylene<br>
glycol, glycerol, N-methyl pyrrolidone, and dimethyl sulfoxide.<br>

In a further aspect, the invention provides emulsion, microemulsion, and micelle<br>
formulations that include a compound of the invention. Methods for making the<br>
emulsion, microemulsion, and micelle formulations are also provided.<br>
As used herein, the term "emulsion" refers to a colloidal dispersion of two<br>
immiscible liquids, such as an oil and water, in the form of droplets, whose diameter, in<br>
general, are between 0.1 and 3.0 microns and which is typically optically opaque, unless<br>
the dispersed and continuous phases are refractive index matched. Such systems possess<br>
a finite stability, generally defined by the application or relevant reference system, which<br>
may be enhanced by the addition of amphiphilic molecules or viscosity enhancers.<br>
The term "microemulsion" refers to a thermodynamically stable isotropically clear<br>
dispersion of two immiscible liquids, such as an oil and water, stabilized by an interfacial<br>
film of surfactant molecules. The microemulsion has a mean droplet diameter of less<br>
than 200 run, in general between 10-50 nm. In the absence of water, mixtures of oil(s)<br>
and non-ionic surfactant(s) form clear and isotropic solutions that are known as<br>
self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) and can be used to improve lipophilic<br>
drug dissolution and oral absorption.<br>
The emulsion and microemulsion formulations include an oil phase and an<br>
aqueous phase. The emulsion or microemulsion can be an oil-in-water emulsion or a<br>
water-in-oil emulsion. The oil phase includes one or more compounds of the invention<br>
and a lipophilic medium, as described above. In one embodiment, the compound is<br>
present in the formulation in an amount from about 0.005 to about 3.0 weight percent<br>
based on the total weight of the formulation. In one embodiment, the compound is<br>
present in the formulation in an amount from about 0.01 to about 2.5 weight percent<br>
based on the total weight of the formulation. In one embodiment, the -compound is<br>
present in the formulation in an amount from about 0.1 to about 1.5 weight percent based<br>
on the total weight of the formulation. In one embodiment, the lipophilic medium is<br>
present in the formulation in an amount from about 2 to about 20 weight percent based on<br><br>
the total weight of the formulation. In one embodiment, the lipophilic medium is present<br>
in the formulation in an amount from about 4 to about 12 weight percent based on the<br>
total weight of the formulation. In one embodiment, the lipophilic medium is present in<br>
the formulation in an amount from about 6 to about 10 weight percent based on the total<br>
weight of the formulation.<br>
In one embodiment of the emulsion or microemulsion, the compound is a<br>
tocopherol-modified therapeutic drug compound, the lipophilic medium includes a<br>
tocopherol, and the aqueous medium is water.<br>
In addition to the compounds of the invention, the emulsion or microemulsion<br>
formulations can include other components commonly used in emulsions an<br>
microemulsions, and particularly used in pharmaceutical emulsions and microemulsions.<br>
These components include surfactants and co-solvents, among others. Representative<br>
surfactants include nonionic surfactants such as surface active tocopherol derivatives and<br>
surface active polymers.<br>
Suitable surface active tocopherol derivatives include tocopherol polyethylene<br>
glycol derivatives, such as vitamin E succinate polyethylene glycol (e.g., d-α-tocopherol<br>
polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate, TPGS), which is a vitamin E derivative in which a<br>
polyethylene glycol is attached by a succinic acid ester at the ring hydroxyl of vitamin E.<br>
As used herein, "vitamin E succinate polyethylene glycol" includes vitamin E succinate<br>
polyethylene glycol and derivatives of vitamin E polyethylene glycol having various ester<br>
and ether links. TPGS is a non-ionic surfactant (HLB = 16-18). TPGS is reported to<br>
inhibit P-glycoprotein, a protein that contributes to the development of multi-drug<br>
resistance. Embodiments of the formulations of the invention that include TPGS<br>
therefore include a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. Surface active tocopherol derivatives (e.g.,<br>
TPGS) can be present in the formulations of the invention in an amount from about 1 to<br>
about 10 weight percent, about 2 to about 6 weight percent, or about 5 weight percent,<br>
based on the total weight of the formulation.<br>
Suitable nonionic surfactants include block copolymers of ethylene oxide and<br>
propylene oxide known as POLOXAMERS or PLUROINICS. These synthetic block<br>
copolymers of having the general structure: H(OCH2CH2)a(OC3H6CH2)b<br>
(OCH2CH2)aOH. The following variants based on the values of a and b are<br>
commercially available from BASF Performance Chemicals (Parsippany, New Jersey)<br>
under the trade name PLURONIC and consist of the group of surfactants designated by<br><br>
the CTFA name of POLOXAMER 108, 188, 217, 237, 238, 288, 338, 407, 101, 105, 122,<br>
123, 124, 181, 182, 183, 184, 212, 231, 282, 331, 401, 402, 185, 215, 234, 235, 284, 333,<br>
334, 335, and 403. For the most commonly used POLOXAMERS 124, 188, 237, 338,<br>
and 407 the values of a and b are 12/20, 79/28, 64/37, 141/44 and 101/56, respectively.<br>
In one embodiment, the nonionic surfactant is present in the formulation in an amount<br>
from about 0.5 to about 5 weight percent based on the total weight of the formulation.<br>
Co-solvents useful in the formulations include ethanol, polyethylene glycol,<br>
propylene glycol, glycerol, N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethylamide, and dimethylsulfoxide,<br>
among others. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a hydrophilic, polymerized form of ethylene<br>
glycol, consisting of repeating units having the chemical structure: (-CH2CH2O-). The<br>
general formula for polyethylene glycol is H(OCH2CH2)nOH. The molecular weight<br>
ranges from 200 to 10,000. Such various forms are described by their molecular weights,<br>
for example, PEG-200, PEG-300, PEG-400, and the like.<br>
Paclitaxel emulsions and their components are described in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 6,458,173 and U.S. Patent No 6,660,286, each expressly incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety.<br>
Representative emulsions including tocopherol-modified therapeutic drug<br>
compounds (e.g., tocopherol succinate docetaxel, tocopherol succinate paclitaxel,<br>
tocopherol succinate camptothecin, tocopherol succinate<br>
7-emyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin, and tocopherol succinate 10-hydroxycamptothecin) are<br>
described in Example 15. In vitro cytotoxicities of representative tocopherol-modified<br>
therapeutic drug compounds (e.g., tocopherol succinate 7-ethyl-10-hydroxy camptothecin<br>
and tocopherol succinate camptothecin) are described in Example 16.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention provides micelle formulations that include a<br>
compound of the invention and an aqueous phase. Micelles are organized aggregates of<br>
one or more surfactants in solution. In one embodiment, the compound is present in the<br>
formulation in an amount from about 0.005 to about 3.0 weight percent based on the total<br>
weight of the formulation. In one embodiment, the compound is present in the<br>
formulation in an amount from about 0.01 to about 2.5 weight percent based on the total<br>
weight of the formulation. In one embodiment, the compound is present in the<br>
formulation in an amount from about 0.1 to about 1.0 weight percent based on the total<br>
weight of the formulation. Suitable surfactants include those noted above, and in the<br>
amounts noted above. In one embodiment of the micelle formulation, the compound is a<br><br>
tocopherol-modified therapeutic drug compound and the surfactant is tocopherol<br>
polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS). Representative micelle formulations including<br>
tocopherol-modified therapeutic drug compounds are described in Example 15.<br>
The micelle formulation can also include additional components such as co-<br>
solvents including those noted above. In one embodiment, the micelle formulation<br>
includes a polyethylene glycol and a lower alkyl alcohol (e.g., ethanol). In one<br>
embodiment, the co-solvents are present in an amount from about 2 to about 20 weight<br>
percent based on the total weight of the formulation. The micelle, emulsion, and<br>
microemulsion formulations include an aqueous phase. In one embodiment, the aqueous<br>
phase includes deionized water. In another embodiment, the aqueous phase includes<br>
saline. In another embodiment, the aqueous phase is saline buffered with an organic acid<br>
(e.g., succinate, citrate).<br>
The invention also provides the use of the compounds of the invention in the<br>
manufacture of a medicament. For example, for compounds of the invention that include<br>
a therapeutic drug moiety derived from a therapeutic drug compound effective in treating<br>
cell proliferative disease, the invention provides the use of such compounds in the<br>
manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of cell proliferative disease.<br>
In other aspects, methods for administering a compound of the invention to a<br>
subject in need thereof, and methods for treating a condition treatable by administration<br>
of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention are also provided.<br>
These methods include the administration of the compounds, compositions, emulsion<br>
formulations, microemulsion formulations, and micelle formulations described herein.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for treating a condition that<br>
is treatable by the parent, unmodified therapeutic drug compound (e.g., a cell proliferative<br>
disease such as cancer). In the method, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound<br>
of the invention is administered to a subject in need thereof.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for treating a cell<br>
proliferative disease by administering a compound of the invention having a therapeutic<br>
drug moiety derived from a therapeutic drug effective in treating cell proliferative<br>
disease. Representative cell proliferative diseases treatable by the compounds of the<br><br>
invention include hematologic cancers, such as leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma; and<br>
nonhematologic cancers, such as solid tumor carcinomas (e.g., breast, ovarian, pancreatic,<br>
colon, colorectal, non-small cell lung, and bladder), sarcomas, and gliomas.<br>
Therapeutically effective amounts of the compounds will generally range up to<br>
the maximally tolerated dosage, but the concentrations are not critical and may vary<br>
widely. The precise amounts employed by the attending physician will vary, of course,<br>
depending on the compound, route of administration, physical condition of the patient<br>
and other factors. The daily dosage may be administered as a single dosage or may be<br>
divided into multiple doses for administration.<br>
The amount of the compound actually administered will be a therapeutically<br>
effective amount, which term is used herein to denote the amount needed to produce a<br>
substantial beneficial effect. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response<br>
curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems. The animal model is also<br>
typically used to determine a desirable dosage range and route of administration. Such<br>
information can then be used to determine useful doses and routes for administration in<br>
humans or other mammals. The determination of an effective dose is well within the<br>
capability of those skilled in the art. Thus, the amount actually administered will be<br>
dependent upon the individual to which treatment is to be applied, and will preferably be<br>
an optimized amount such that the desired effect is achieved without significant<br>
side-effects.<br>
Therapeutic efficacy and possible toxicity of the compounds of the invention can<br>
be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures, in cell cultures or experimental<br>
animals (e.g., ED50, the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population; and<br>
LD50, the dose lethal to 50% of the population). The dose ratio between therapeutic and<br>
toxic effects is the therapeutic index, and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50 to ED50.<br>
Modified therapeutic drug compounds that exhibit large therapeutic indices are<br>
particularly suitable in the practice of the methods of the invention. The data obtained<br>
from cell culture assays and animal studies may be used in formulating a range of dosage<br>
for use in humans or other mammals. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably<br>
within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no<br>
toxicity. The dosage typically varies within this range depending upon the dosage form<br>
employed, sensitivity of the patient, and the route of administration. Thus, optimal<br><br>
amounts will vary with the method of administration, and will generally be in accordance<br>
with the amounts of conventional medicaments administered in the same or a similar<br>
form.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be administered alone, or in combination<br>
with one or more additional therapeutic agents. For example, in the treatment of cancer,<br>
the compounds can be administered in combination with therapeutic agents including, but<br>
not limited to, androgen inhibitors, such as flutamide and luprolide; antiestrogens, such as<br>
tamoxifen; antimetabolites and cytotoxic agents, such as daunorubicin, fluorouracil,<br>
floxuridine, interferon alpha, methotrexate, plicamycin, mecaptopurine, thioguanine,<br>
adriamycin, carmustine, lomustine, cytarabine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,<br>
estramustine, altretamine, hydroxyurea, ifosfamide, procarbazine, mutamycin, busulfan,<br>
mitoxantrone, carboplatin, cisplatin, streptozocin, bleomycin, dactinomycin, and<br>
idamycin; hormones, such as medroxyprogesterone, estramustine, ethinyl estradiol,<br>
estradiol, leuprolide, megestrol, octreotide, diethylstilbestrol, chlorotrianisene, etoposide,<br>
podophyllotoxin, and goserelin; nitrogen mustard derivatives, such as melphalan,<br>
chlorambucil, methloretharnine, and thiotepa, steroids, such as betamethasone; and other<br>
antineoplastic agents, such as live Mycobacterium bovis, dicarbazine, asparaginase,<br>
leucovorin, mitotane, vincristine, vinblastine, and taxotere. Appropriate amounts in each<br>
case will vary with the particular agent, and will be either readily known to those skilled<br>
in the art or readily determinable by routine experimentation.<br>
Adrninistration of the compounds of the invention is accomplished by any<br>
effective route, for example, parenteral, topical, or oral routes. Methods of administration<br>
include inhalational, buccal, intramedullary, intravenous, intranasal, intrarectal,<br>
intraocular, intraabdominal, intraarterial, intraarticular, intracapsular, intracervical,<br>
intracranial, intraductal, intradural, intralesional, intramuscular, intralumbar, intramural,<br>
intraocular, intraoperative, intraparietal, intraperitoneal, intrapleural, intrapulmonary,<br>
intraspinal, intrathoracic, intratracheal, intratympanic, intrauterine, intravascular, and<br>
intraventricular administration, and other conventional means. The compounds of the<br>
invention having anti-tumor activity can be injected directly into a tumor, into the vicinity<br>
of a tumor, or into a blood vessel that supplies blood to the tumor.<br>
The emulsion, microemulsion, and micelle formulations of the invention can be<br>
nebulized using suitable aerosol propellants that are known in the art for pulmonary<br>
delivery of the compounds.<br><br>
The compounds of the invention may be formulated into a composition that<br>
additionally comprises suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, including excipients<br>
and other compounds that facilitate administration of the compound to a subject. Further<br>
details on techniques for formulation and administration may be found in the latest<br>
edition of "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences" (Maack Publishing Co., Easton, PA).<br>
Compositions for oral administration may be formulated using pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carriers well known in the art, in dosages suitable for oral administration.<br>
Such carriers enable the compositions containing the compounds of the invention to be<br>
formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions,<br>
suitable for ingestion by a subject. Compositions for oral use may be formulated, for<br>
example, in combination with a solid excipient, optionally grinding the resulting mixture,<br>
and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable additional compounds, if<br>
desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients include carbohydrate or<br>
protein fillers. These include, but are not limited to, sugars, including lactose, sucrose,<br>
mannitol, or sorbitol, starch from corn, wheat, rice, potato, or other plants; cellulose such<br>
as methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, or sodium carboxymethylcellulose;<br>
and gums including arabic and tragacanth; as well as proteins, such as gelatin and<br>
collagen. If desired, disintegrating or solubilizing agents may be added, such as the<br>
crosslinked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, alginic acid, or a salt thereof, such as sodium<br>
alginate.<br>
Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings such as concentrated sugar<br>
solutions, which may also contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinylpyrrolidone, carbopol gel,<br>
polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic<br>
solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee<br>
coatings for product identification or to characterize the quantity of active compound<br>
(i.e., dosage).<br>
Compounds for oral administration may be formulated, for example, as push-fit<br>
capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a coating<br>
such as glycerol or sorbitol. Push-fit capsules may contain the compounds mixed with<br>
filler or binders such as lactose or starches, lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate.<br>
and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the covalent conjugates may be dissolved or<br>
suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene<br>
glycol with or without stabilizers.<br><br>
For topical or nasal administration, penetrants appropriate to the particular barrier<br>
to be permeated are typically used in the formulation. Examples of these are<br>
2-pyrrolidone, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, dimethylacetamide, dimethyl-formamide,<br>
propylene glycol, methyl or isopropyl alcohol, dimethyl sulfoxide, and azone. Additional<br>
agents may further be included to make the formulation cosmetically acceptable.<br>
Examples of these are fats, waxes, oils, dyes, fragrances, preservatives, stabilizers, and<br>
surface-active agents. Keratolytic agents such as those known in the art may also be<br>
included. Examples are salicylic acid and sulfur. For topical administration, the<br>
composition may be in the form of a transdermal ointment or patch for systemic delivery<br>
of the compound and may be prepared in a conventional manner (see, e.g., Barry,<br>
Dermatological Formulations (Drugs and the Pharmaceutical Sciences -- Dekker); Harry's<br>
Cosmeticology (Leonard Hill Books).<br>
For rectal administration, the compositions may be administered in the form of<br>
suppositories or retention enemas. Such compositions may be prepared by mixing the<br>
compounds with a suitable non-irritating excipient that is solid at ordinary temperatures<br>
but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the<br>
drug. Suitable excipients include, but are not limited to, cocoa butter and polyethylene<br>
glycols.<br>
The amounts of each of these various types of additives will be readily apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art, optimal amounts being the same as in other, known formulations<br>
designed for the same type of administration.<br>
Compositions containing the compounds of the invention may be manufactured in<br>
a manner similar to that known in the art (e.g., by means of conventional mixing,<br>
dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating,<br>
entrapping or lyophilizing processes). The compositions may also be modified to provide<br>
appropriate release characteristics, sustained release, or targeted release, by conventional<br>
means (e.g., coating). As noted above, in one embodiment, the compounds are<br>
formulated as an emulsion.<br>
Compositions containing the compounds may be provided as a salt and can be<br>
formed with many acids, including but not limited to hydrochloric, sulfuric, acetic, lactic,<br>
tartaric, malic, and succinic. Salts tend to be more soluble in aqueous or other protonic<br>
solvents than are the corresponding free base forms.<br><br>
After compositions formulated to contain a compound and an acceptable carrier<br>
have been prepared, they can be placed in an appropriate container and labeled for use.<br>
Thus, in another aspect, the invention provides kits.<br>
Tocopherol-modified therapeutic drug compounds of the invention are suitable for<br>
administration as oil-in-water emulsions and micelle formulations. The compounds<br>
provide for high drug loading to enable small volumes for administration.<br>
Emulsions containing tocopherol-modified camptothecin compounds of the<br>
invention provide for enhanced stability of the compound's lactone compared to<br>
conventional methods of camptothecin administration. Long plasma half-life is achieved<br>
for the tocopherol-modified camptothecin compounds resulting in prolonged exposure of<br>
a tumor to the compounds. Tocopherol-modified compounds achieve high permeation<br>
through lipoidal membranes of tumor cells. Greater anti-tumor response without an<br>
increase in toxicity may be provided by the tocopherol-modified camptothecin<br>
compounds of the invention as compared to unmodified camptothecin and currently<br>
available camptothecin analogs.<br>
Although the compounds of the invention having formula (2) with m = 1, formula<br>
(3) with n = 1, or formula (8) do not include compounds specifically excluded as<br>
described above, it will be appreciated that the compositions, emulsion formulations,<br>
microemulsion formulations, and micelle formulations include the compounds of the<br>
invention having formulae (l)-(8) without such limitation. Methods for administering the<br>
compositions, emulsion formulations, microemulsion formulations, and micelle<br>
formulations, and methods for treating a condition treatable by administering the<br>
compositions, emulsion formulations, microemulsion formulations, and micelle<br>
formulations are likewise not limited with regard to the compounds of the invention.<br>
The following examples are provided to illustrate, not limit, the invention.<br>

EXAMPLE 16<br>
In vitro Stability of Lactone of Representative Tocopherol-Modified<br>
Therapeutic Drug Compounds in Presence of Human Albumin<br>
In this example, the in vitro stability in the presence of human albumin of the<br>
lactone form of representative tocopherol-modified therapeutic drug compounds of the<br>
invention, tocopherol succinate camptothecin and tocopherol succinate 7-ethyl-10-<br>
hydroxycamptothecin, was compared to the in vitro stability of the lactone form of<br>
camptothecin.<br>
Because the lactone (ring E) is a critical moiety for camptothecin activity and it is<br>
reported not to be stable under physiological conditions (pH = 7.4), the stability of the<br>
lactone for tocopherol succinate camptothecin and tocopherol succinate 7-ethyl-10-<br>
hydroxycamptothecin was determined. The solubilization of tocopherol succinate<br>
camptothecin and tocopherol succinate 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin in the oil-phase<br>
is thought to protect the lactone from hydrolysis and thus provide improved lactone<br>
stability in physiological conditions. To evaluate lactone stability, a saline buffered<br>
solution (10 mM, pH 7.4) containing 4% human serum albumin was incubated at 37°C in<br>
the presence of camptothecin (dissolved in DMSO), tocopherol succinate camptothecin<br>
emulsion (prepared as described in Example 15C, referred to herein as<br>
"SN2300 emulsion") or tocopherol succinate 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin emulsion<br>
(prepared as described in Example 15A, referred to herein as "SN2310 emulsion"). High<br>
performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection was used to analyze the<br>
decrease in the concentration of the lactone form over time.<br><br>
FIGURE 12 illustrates the percent change in concentration of the lactone form<br>
over time for camptothecin, tocopherol succinate camptothecin (SN2300), and tocopherol<br>
succinate 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN2310), in the presence of human serum<br>
albumin. The stability of the lactone of tocopherol succinate camptothecin and<br>
tocopherol succinate 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin is greater than that of<br>
camptothecin. This dramatic increase in the stability of the lactone may result in<br>
increased activity compared to the unmodified camptothecin parent compound.<br>
EXAMPLE 17<br>
In vitro Cytotoxicity of Representative<br>
Tocopherol-Modified Therapeutic Drug Compounds<br>
In this example, the in vitro cytotoxicty of representative tocopherol-modified<br>
therapeutic drug compounds of the invention, tocopherol succinate camptothecin and<br>
tocopherol succinate 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin, was compared to the in vitro<br>
cytotoxicity of camptothecin, 10-hydroxycamptothecin, SN38, irinotecan, and topotecan.<br>
The in vitro cytotoxicity, as measured by GI50 (50% of growth inhibition) values,<br>
of tocopherol succinate camptothecin and tocopherol succinate 7-ethyl- 10-<br>
hydroxycamptothecin was investigated and compared to the National Cancer Institute<br>
(NCI) GI50 values for camptothecin, 10-hydroxycamptothecin, SN-38, irinotecan, and<br>
topotecan in the following cancer cell lines: NCI-H460 (ATCC #HTB-177) (non-small<br>
cell lung), HCT-15 (ATCC #CCL-225) (colorectal), HT-116 (ATCC #CCL-247)<br>
(colorectal), HT-29 (ATCC #HTB-38) (colorectal), MCF-7 (ATCC #HTB-22) (breast),<br>
and OVCAR-3 (ATCC #HTB-161) (ovarian).<br>
The study was performed using emulsion formulations of tocopherol succinate<br>
7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (described in Example 15A) and tocopherol succinate<br>
camptothecin (described in Example 15C) diluted in the corresponding cell media. The<br>
cells were in contact with varying concentrations of the test article for a period of<br>
48 hours. At the end of 48 hours, staining with ALAMAR BLUE was performed to<br>
determine the number of viable cells and calculate the degree of cellular growth<br>
inhibition as compared to a control group. The percent of inhibition versus concentration<br>
was fit to the Hill equation to determine concentration that produces 50% of growth<br>
inhibition (GI50).<br><br>
The sensitivity of the tested cell lines to tocopherol succinate camptothecin<br>
(SN2300), tocopherol succinate 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN2310),<br>
camptothecin, irinotecan, and topotecan is illustrated in Table 2 and Figure 13.<br>
Table 2. Comparative drug concentration that produce 50% cell growth inhibition<br>
(GI50).<br><br>
CPT: Camptothecin; 10-HO-CPT: 10-hydroxycamptothecin; SN38: 7-ethyl-10-<br>
hydroxycamtothecin; VESA-CPT: tocopherol succinate camptothecin;<br>
VESA-SN3 8: tocopherol succinate 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamothecin.<br>
The results in Table 2 illustrates that formulations of tocopherol-modified<br>
therapeutic drug compounds of the invention provide effective anti-tumor activity.<br>
FIGURE 13 is a plot of the GI50 values (concentration that produces 50% growth<br>
inhibition) determined for tocopherol succinate camptothecin and tocopherol succinate<br>
7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin in four of the tested cell lines. The values reported by<br>
the NCI in these same cancer cell lines for camptothecin, irinotecan, and topotecan is also<br>
included as comparison. A high GI50 value corresponds to a low drug concentration to<br>
produce 50% inhibition. From the graph, it is clear that the compounds of the invention,<br><br>
tocopherol succinate camptothecin and tocopherol succinate 7-ethyl-10-<br>
hychoxycamptothecin, show a high level of cytotoxic activity similar to camptothecin.<br>
EXAMPLE 18<br>
Pharmacokinetics of Representative Tocopherol-Modified Therapeutic Drug Compounds<br>
In this example, the pharmacokinetics of representative tocopherol-modified<br>
therapeutic drug compounds of the invention, tocopherol succinate camptothecin and<br>
tocopherol succinate 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin, was compared to camptothecin,<br>
irinotecan, and topotecan.<br>
The pharmacokinetic profiles of tocopherol succinate camptothecin and<br>
tocopherol succinate 7-ethyl-10-hydroxy camptothecin were investigated in<br>
Sprague-Dawley rats following a bolus, intravenous administration of emulsion<br>
formulations of the drug compounds (SN2300 emulsion and SN2310 emulsion) via the<br>
lateral tail vein at a dose of approximately 14 mg of drug compound/kg of body weight.<br>
Blood samples were collected for up to 120 hours post dose via the jugular vein. The<br>
concentration of each camptothecin derivative in plasma was determined by high<br>
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection.<br>
A noncompartmental analysis was carried out using WinNonlin (v 4.1).<br>
The pharmacokinetic profiles of tocopherol succinate camptothecin (SN2300) and<br>
tocopherol succinate 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN2310) are illustrated in<br>
FIGURES 14A and 14B, respectively. FIGURES 14A and 14B illustrate<br>
concentration-time values after an intravenous injection of 13.8 mg of drug compound/kg<br>
of body weight for tocopherol succinate camptothecin (SN2300 emulsion) and tocopherol<br>
succinate 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN2310 emulsion), respectively. Referring<br>
to FIGURES 14A and 14B, a prolonged plasma half-life following intravenous<br>
administration, particularly for tocopherol succinate camptothecin, is shown.<br>
The calculated plasma elimination half-life, mean residence time, and clearance of<br>
tocopherol succinate camptothecin (SN2300), tocopherol succinate 7-ethyl-10-<br>
hydroxycamptothecin (SN2310), camptothecin, irinotecan, and topotecan is provided in<br>
Table 3.<br>
The term "plasma elimination half-life" refers to the time necessary to reduce the<br>
drug concentration in plasma by 50% after equilibrium is reached. The term "elimination<br>
rate constant" refers to the fraction of drug eliminated per unit of time. With first-order<br>
elimination, the rate of elimination is directly proportional to the serum drug<br><br>
concentration. There is a linear relationship between rate of elimination and serum drug<br>
concentration. Although the amount of drug eliminated in a first-order process changes<br>
with concentration, the fraction of a drug eliminated remains constant.<br>
The term "clearance" refers to a measure of the body's ability to eliminate drug<br>
and is a hypothetical volume of distribution of drug which is cleared per unit time (i.e.,<br>
mL/min) by any pathway of drug removal. It is important to clarify that the clearance<br>
does not indicate how much drug is being removed, rather, the volume of biological fluid<br>
such as blood or plasma that would have to be completely freed of drug to account for the<br>
elimination. The term "volume of distribution" refers to a calculated volume of body<br>
fluid that would be required to dissolve the total amount of drug at the same<br>
concentration as that found in the blood. It is a proportionality constant relating the<br>
amount of drug in the body to the measured concentration in biological fluid (blood,<br>
plasma, serum).<br>

administration in rats of tocopherol succinate camptothecin (SN2300) and tocopherol<br>
succinate 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN2310) compared to camptothecin,<br>
irinotecan, and topotecan.<br><br>
aEl-Gizawy SA, Hedaya MA. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol, 43: 364-370<br>
(1999).<br>
bAtsumi R, Okazaji O Hakusui H. Biol. Pharm. Bull., 18 (8): 1114-1119 (1995).<br>
Table 3 illustrates that the calculated plasma elimination half-life of tocopherol<br>
succinate camptothecin (SN2300) and tocopherol succinate<br>
7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN2310) is approximately 30-times and 3-times longer<br>
than the commercially available analogs, respectively. The higher mean residence time<br><br>
(MRT) and lower clearance rate suggest a longer tumor exposure time to these new<br>
derivatives, which may indicate a potential for increased chemotherapeutic effect.<br>
Through lipophilic modification of therapeutic drug compounds, the plasma<br>
elimination half-life of the parent therapeutic drug compound can be increased. The<br>
compounds of the invention, by virtue of the lipophilic moiety (e.g., tocopherol moiety),<br>
have increased plasma elimination half-life compared to the parent therapeutic drug. As<br>
illustrated above for tocopherol succinate camptothecin and tocopherol succinate<br>
7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin, the plasma elimination half-life is significantly<br>
increased compared to the parent compounds.<br>

In vivo Anti-Tumor Activity of Representative Tocopherol-Modified<br>
Therapeutic Drug Compounds in Human Tumor Xenographs<br>
In this example, the in vivo anti-tumor activity of representative<br>
tocopherol-modified therapeutic drug compounds of the invention, tocopherol succinate<br>
camptothecin and tocopherol succinate 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin, was compared<br>
to the anti-tumor effect of irinotecan.<br>
NCI-H460 Human Tumor Xenograft. Athymic mice were subcutaneously<br>
implanted with a cell suspension (107 cells/mouse). When tumors reached an appropriate<br>
size, animals were randomized into groups of eight and intravenously administered the<br>
following compounds at a dose of 15 mg of drug compound/kg of body weight on a<br>
schedule of qldx5 for two consecutive weeks:<br>
Saline-control group<br>
Irinotecan<br>
SN2300 emulsion<br>
SN2310 emulsion<br>
HT-29 Human Tumor Xenograft. Athymic mice were subcutaneously implanted<br>
with 30-40 mg tumor fragments using 12-gauge trocar needles. A sufficient number of<br>
mice were implanted with fragments so tumors in narrow weight range (100-200 mg)<br>
were selected for the trial on staging day (SD). The animals selected with tumors in the<br>
proper size range were randomized into six groups of 10 animals and intravenously<br>
administered the following test compounds:<br><br><br>
In both xenograph studies, animal body weights and tumors were measured twice<br>
weekly following the initiation of dosing. The tumor measurements were performed using<br>
a caliper (millimeters); the tumor volume was calculated based on the formula:<br>
(Length x width2) / 2 = Volume (mm3).<br>
The anti-tumor effect of SN2300 and SN2310 emulsions administered to athymic<br>
mice implanted with NCI-H460 human tumor cells and HT-29 human tumor cells is<br>
graphically represented in FIGURES 15A and 15B, respectively. Although the<br>
SN2300 emulsion showed little to no anti-rumor effect in this model, the<br>
SN2310 emulsion exhibited substantial anti-tumor effect as compared to both saline<br>
control and irinotecan.<br>
The calculated tumor response parameters for the HT-29 xenograft study is<br>
provided in Table 4. Fifty-five days after dose initiation, 30% of mice in the control<br>
group were sacrificed because of tumor size (&gt;4000 mm3) and the median tumor size was<br>
3136 mm3. At this same timepoint, 80% of the mice in the SN2310 (q3dx10) group<br>
presented no measurable tumor. In addition, the SN2310 (qldx5) group had a median<br>
tumor size of 126 mm with 40% having no measurable tumor. At the same time, the<br>
irinotecan group showed a median tumor size of 1637 mm . The results indicate that the<br>
administration of SN2310 produces significant anti-tumor activity.<br>
