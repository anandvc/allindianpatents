				<td>METHODS OF USE AND COMPOSITIONS FOR THE DIAGNOSIS AND<br>
TREATMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to methods and compositions for treating disease<br>
caused by microorganisms, particularly tuberculosis. The present invention also relates to<br>
methods and compositions having improved anti-mycobacterial activity, namely<br>
compositions comprising novel substituted ethylene diamine compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Mycobacterial infections often manifest as diseases such as tuberculosis. Human<br>
infections caused by mycobacteria have been widespread since ancient times, and<br>
tuberculosis remains a leading cause of death today. Although the incidence of the disease<br>
declined, in parallel with advancing standards of living, since the mid-nineteenth century,<br>
mycobacterial diseases still constitute a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in<br>
countries with limited medical resources. Additionally, mycobacterial diseases can cause<br>
overwhelming, disseminated disease in immunocompromised patients. In spite of the<br>
efforts of numerous health organizations worldwide, the eradication of mycobacterial<br>
diseases has never been achieved, nor is eradication imminent. Nearly one third of the<br>
world's population is infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, commonly<br>
referred to as tuberculosis (TB), with approximately 8 million new cases, and two to three<br>
million deaths attributable to TB yearly. Tuberculosis (TB) is the cause of the largest<br>
number of human deaths attributable to a single etiologic agent (see Dye et al., J. Am. Med.<br>
Association, 282, 677-686, (1999); and 2000 WHO/OMS Press Release).<br>
After decades of decline, TB is now on the rise. In the United States, up to 10<br>
million individuals are believed to be infected. Almost 28,000 new cases were reported in<br>
1990, constituting a 9.4 percent increase over 1989. A sixteen percent increase in TB cases<br>
was observed from 19S5 to 1990. Overcrowded living conditions and shared air spaces are<br>
especially conducive to the spread of TB, contributing to the increase in instances that have<br>
been observed among prison inmates, and among the homeless in larger U.S. cities.<br>
Approximately half of all patients with "Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome" (AIDS)<br>
will acquire a mycobacterial infection, with TB "being an especially devastating<br>
complication. AIDS patients are at higher risks of developing clinical TB, and anti-TB<br>
treatment seems to be less effective than in non-AIDS patients. Consequently, the<br>
infection often progresses to a fatal disseminated disease.<br>
Mycobacteria other than M. tuberculosis are increasingly found in opportunistic<br>
infections that plague the AIDS patient. Organisms from the M. avium-intracellulare<br>
complex (MAC), especially serotypes four and eight, account for 68% of the mycobacteria!<br>
isolates from AIDS patients. Enormous numbers of MAC are found (up to 10 acid-fast<br>
bacilli per gram of tissue), and consequently, the prognosis for the infected AIDS patient is<br>
poor.<br>
The World Health Organization (WHO) continues to encourage the battle against<br>
TB, recommending prevention initiatives such as the "Expanded Program on<br>
Immunization" (EPI), and therapeutic compliance initiatives such as "Directly Observed<br>
Treatment Short-Course" (DOTS). For the eradication of TB, diagnosis, treatment, and<br>
prevention are equally important. Rapid detection of active TB patients will lead to early<br>
treatment by which about 90% cure is expected. Therefore, early diagnosis is critical for<br>
the battle against TB. In addition, therapeutic compliance will ensure not only elimination<br>
of infection, but also reduction in the emergence of drug-resistance strains.<br>
The emergence of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis is an extremely disturbing<br>
phenomenon. The rate of new TB cases proven resistant to at least one standard drug<br>
increased from 10 percent in the early 19S0's to 23 percent in 1991. Compliance with<br>
therapeutic regimens, therefore, is also a crucial component in efforts to eliminate TB and<br>
prevent the emergence of drug resistant strains. Equally important is the development of<br>
new therapeutic agents that are effective as vaccines, and as treatments, for disease caused<br>
by drug resistant strains of mycobacteria.<br>
Although over 37 species of mycobacteria have been identified, more than 95% of<br>
all human infections are caused by six species of mycobacteria: M. tuberculosis, M. avium<br>
intracellulare, M. kansasii, M. fortuitum, M. chelonae, and M. leprae. The most prevalent<br>
mycobacterial disease in humans is tuberculosis (TB) winch is predominantly caused by<br>
mycobacterial species comprising M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, or M. africamum (Merck<br>
Manual 1992). Infection is typically initiated by the inhalation of infectious particles<br>
which are able to reach the terminal pathways in lungs. Following engulfment by alveolar<br>
macrophages, the bacilli are able to replicate freely, with eventual destruction of the<br>
phagocytic cells. A cascade effect ensues wherein destruction of the phagocytic cells<br>
causes additional macrophages and lymphocytes to migrate to the site of infection, where<br>
they too are ultimately eliminated. The disease is further disseminated during the initial<br>
stages by the infected macrophages which travel to local lymph nodes, as well as into the<br>
blood stream and other tissues such as the bone marrow, spleen, kidneys, bone and central<br>
nervous system. (See Murray et al. Medical Microbiology, The C.V. Mosby Company<br>
219-230(1990)).<br>
There is still no clear understanding of the factors which contribute to the virulence<br>
of mycobacteria. Many investigators have implicated lipids of the cell wall and bacterial<br>
surface as contributors to colony morphology and virulence. Evidence suggests that C-<br>
mycosides, on the surface of certain mycobacterial cells, are important in facilitating<br>
survival of the organism within macrophages. Trehalose 6,6' dimycolate, a cord factor, has<br>
been implicated for other mycobacteria.<br>
The interrelationship of colony morphology and virulence is particularly<br>
pronounced in M. avium. M. avium bacilli occur in several distinct colony forms. Bacilli<br>
which grow as transparent, or rough, colonies on conventional laboratory media are<br>
multiplicable within macrophages in tissue culture, are virulent when injected into<br>
susceptible mice, and are resistant to antibiotics. Rough or transparent bacilli, which are<br>
maintained on laboratory culture media, often spontaneously assume an opaque R colony<br>
morphology, at which time they are not multiplicable in macrophages, are avirulent in<br>
mice, and are highly susceptible to antibiotics. The differences in colony morphology<br>
between the transparent, rough and opaque strains of M. avium are almost certainly due to<br>
the presence of a glycolipid coating on the surface of transparent and rough organisms<br>
which acts as a protective capsule. This capsule, or coating, is composed primarily of C-<br>
mycosides which apparently shield the virulent M. avium organisms from lysosomal<br>
enzymes and antibiotics. By contrast, the non-virulent opaque forms ofM. avium have<br>
very little C-mycoside on their surface. Both the resistance to antibiotics and the resistance<br>
to killing by macrophages have been attributed to the glycolipid barrier on the surface of<br>
M. avium.<br>
Diagnosis of mycobacterial infection is confirmed by the isolation and<br>
identification of the pathogen, although conventional diagnosis is based on sputum smears,<br>
chest X-ray examination (CXR), and clinical symptoms. Isolation of mycobacteria on a<br>
medium takes as long as four to eight weeks. Species identification takes a further two<br>
weeks. There are several other techniques for detecting mycobacteria such as the<br>
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), mycobacterium tuberculosis direct test, or amplified<br>
mycobacterium tuberculosis 'direct test (MTD), and detection assays that utilize<br>
radioactive labels.<br>
One diagnostic test that is widely used for detecting infections caused by M.<br>
tuberculosis is the tuberculin skin test. Although numerous versions of the skin test are<br>
available, typically one of two preparations of tuberculin antigens are used: old tuberculin<br>
(OT), or purified protein derivative (PPD). The antigen preparation is either injected into<br>
the skin intradermally, or is topically applied and is then invasively transported into the<br>
skin with the use of a multiprong inoculator (Tine test). Several problems exist with the<br>
skin test diagnosis method. For example, the Tine test is not generally recommended<br>
because the amount of antigen injected into the intradermal layer cannot be accurately<br>
controlled. (See Murray et al. Medical Microbiology, The C.V. Mosby Company 219-230<br>
(1990)).<br>
Although the tuberculin skin tests are widely used, they typically require two to<br>
three days to generate results, and many times, the results are inaccurate since false<br>
positives are sometimes seen in subjects who have been exposed to mycobacteria, but are<br>
healthy. In addition, instances of mis-diagnosis are frequent since a positive result is<br>
observed not only in active TB patients, but also in persons vaccinated with Bacille<br>
Calmette-Guerm (BCG), and those who had been infected with mycobacteria, but have not<br>
developed the disease. It is hard therefore, to distinguish active TB patients from the<br>
others, such as household TB contacts, by the tuberculin skin test. Additionally, the<br>
tuberculin test often produces a cross-reaction in those individuals who were infected with<br>
mycobacteria other than M. tuberculosis (MOTT). Therefore, diagnosis using the skin tests<br>
currently available is frequently subject to error and inaccuracies.<br>
The standard treatment for tuberculosis caused by drug-sensitive organisms is a six-<br>
month regimen consisting of four drugs given for two months, followed by two drugs given<br>
for four months. The two most important drugs, given throughout the six-month course of<br>
therapy, are isomazid and rifampin. Although the regimen is relatively simple, its<br>
administration is quite complicated. Daily ingestion of eight or nine pills is often required<br>
during the first phase of therapy; a daunting and confusing prospect. Even severely ill<br>
patients are often symptom free within a few weeks, and nearly all appear to be cured<br>
within a few months. If the treatment is not continued to completion, however, the patient<br>
may experience a relapse, and the relapse rate for patients who do not continue treatment to<br>
completion is high. A variety of forms of patient-centered care are used to promote<br>
adherence with therapy. The most effective way of ensuring that patients are talcing their<br>
medication is to use directly observed therapy, which involves having a member of the<br>
health care team observe the patient take each dose of each drug. Directly observed<br>
therapy can be provided in the clinic, the patient's residence, or any mutually agreed upon<br>
site. Nearly all patients who have tuberculosis caused by drug-sensitive organisms, and<br>
who complete therapy will be cured, and the risk of relapse is very low ("Ending Neglect:<br>
The Elimination of Tuberculosis in the United States" ed. L. Geiter Committee on the<br>
Elimination of Tuberculosis in the United States Division of Health Promotion and Disease<br>
Prevention, Institute of Medicine. Unpublished.)<br>
What is needed are effective therapeutic regimens that include improved<br>
vaccination and treatment protocols. Currently available therapeutics are no longer<br>
consistently effective as a result of the problems with treatment compliance, and these<br>
compliance problems contribute to the development of drug resistant mycobacterial strains.<br>
Ethambutol (EMB) is a widely used antibiotic for the treatment of TB, with over<br>
300 million doses delivered for tuberculosis therapy in 1988.<br>
Ethambutol, developed by Lederle Laboratories in the 1950s, has low toxicity and<br>
is a good pharmacokinetic. However, ethambutol has a relatively high Minimum<br>
Inhibition Concentration (MIC) of about 5 µg/ml, and can cause optic neuritis. Thus, there<br>
is an increasing need foT new, and more effective, therapeutic compositions (See for<br>
example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,176,040, U.S. Pat. No. 4,262,122; U.S. Pat. No. 4,006,234; U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 3,931,157; U.S. Pat. No. 3, 931,152; U.S. Re. 29,358; and Hausleref a/.,<br>
Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry Letters 11 (2001) 1679-1681). In the decoder years<br>
since the discovery of the beneficial effects of ethambutol, few pharmacological advances<br>
in TB treatment have been developed. Moreover, with the combined emergence of drug<br>
resistant strains, and the more prevalent spread of mycobacterial disease, it is becoming<br>
seriously apparent that new therapeutic compositions are crucial in the fight against<br>
tuberculosis.<br>
Clearly effective therapeutic regimens that include improved vaccination and<br>
treatment protocols are needed. A therapeutic vaccine that would prevent the onset of<br>
tuberculosis, and therefore eliminate the need for therapy is desirable. Although currently<br>
available therapeutics such as ethambutol are effective, the emergence of drug resistant<br>
strains has necessitated new formulations and compositions that are more versatile than<br>
ethambutol. Currently available therapeutics are no longer consistently effective as a result<br>
of the problems with treatment compliance, lending to the development of drug resistant<br>
mycobacterial strains. What is needed are new anti-tubercular drugs that provide highly<br>
effective treatment, and shorten or simplify tuberculosis chemotherapy.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention may be understood more readily by reference to the<br>
following detailed description of the specific embodiments included herein. However,<br>
although the present invention has been described with reference to specific details of<br>
certain embodiments thereof, it is not intended that such details should be regarded as<br>
limitations upon the scope of the invention. The entire text of the references mentioned<br>
herein are hereby incorporated in their entireties by reference including United States<br>
Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/381,244 filed May 17, 2002 and United States<br>
Patent Application Serial No. 10/147,587 filed May 17, 2002.<br>
Mycobacterial infections, such as those causing tuberculosis, once thought to be<br>
declining in occurrence, have rebounded, and again constitute a serious health threat.<br>
Tuberculosis (TB) is the cause of the largest number of human deaths attributed to a single<br>
etiologic agent with two to three million people infected with tuberculosis dying each year.<br>
Areas where humans are crowded together, or living in substandard housing, are<br>
increasingly found to have persons affected with mycobacteria. Individuals who are<br>
immunocompromised are at great risk of being infected with mycobacteria and dying from<br>
such infection. In addition, the emergence of drug-resistant strains of mycobacteria has led<br>
to treatment problems of such infected persons.<br>
Many people who are infected with mycobacteria are poor, or live in areas with<br>
inadequate healthcare facilities. As a result of various obstacles (economical, education<br>
levels, etc.), many of these individuals are unable to comply with the prescribed therapeutic<br>
regimens. Ultimately, persistent non-compliance by these and other individuals results in<br>
the prevalence of disease. This noncompliance is frequently compounded by the<br>
emergence of drug-resistant strains of mycobacteria. Effective compositions and vaccines<br>
that target various strains of mycobacteria are necessary to bring the increasing number of<br>
tuberculosis cases under control.<br>
Chemotherapy is a standard treatment for tuberculosis. Some current chemotherapy<br>
treatments require the use of three or four drugs, in combination, administered daily for<br>
two months, or administered biweekly for four to twelve months. Table 1 lists several<br>
treatment schedules for standard tuberculosis drug regimens.<br><br>
Decades of misuse of existing antibiotics and poor compliance with prolong and<br>
complex therapeutic regimens has led to mutations of the mycobacterium tuberculosis and<br>
has created an epidemic of drug resistance that threatens tuberculosis control world wide.<br>
The vast majority of currently prescribed drugs, including the front line drugs, such as<br>
isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and streptomycin were developed from the<br>
1950s to the 1970s. Thus, this earlier development of tuberculosis chemotherapy did not<br>
have at its disposal the implications of the genome sequence of Mycobacterium<br>
tuberculosis, the revolution in pharmaceutical drug discovery of the last decades, and the<br>
use of national drug testing and combinational chemistry.<br>
Consequently, the treatments of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains, and latent<br>
tuberculosis infections, require new anti-tuberculosis drugs that provide highly effective<br>
treatments, and shortened and simplified tuberculosis chemotherapies. Moreover, it is<br>
desirable that these drugs be prepared by a low-cost synthesis, since the demographics of<br>
the disease dictate that cost is a significant factor.<br>
The present invention provides methods and compositions comprising a class of<br>
substituted ethylene diamine compounds effective in treatment and prevention of disease<br>
caused by microorganisms including, but not limited to, bacteria. In particular, the<br>
methods and compositions of the present invention are effective in inhibiting the growth of<br>
the microorganism, M. tuberculosis. The methods and compositions, of the present<br>
invention are intended for the treatment of mycobacteria infections in human, as well as<br>
other animals. For example, the present invention may be particularly useful for the<br>
treatment of cows infected by M. bovis.<br>
As used herein, the term "tuberculosis" comprises disease states usually associated<br>
with infections caused by mycobacteria species comprising M. tuberculosis complex. The<br>
term "tuberculosis" is also associated with mycobacterial infections caused by<br>
mycobacteria other thanM tuberculosis (MOTT). Other mycobacterial species include M.<br>

Second Generation Antibiotics from Ethambutol<br>
The present invention is particularly directed to a novel library of diamine<br>
compounds of Ethambutol family comprising a modified ethylene linker starting from<br>
commercially available amino alcohol pre-loaded resins.<br><br>
In an effort to enhance the structural diversity of our library of Ethambutol analogs<br>
and to assess the influence of a modified linker on the activity of structurally diverse<br>
diamines against M.taberculosis, the synthetic scheme to incorporate amino acids into the<br>
bridging linker between the two amine components was modified. Use of amino acids was<br>
of a special interest since it allowed introduction of another diversity element into the<br>
linker (as R4), as well as chirality.<br>
It was crucial for the project to synthesize a sub-library of diamines closely related<br>
to Ethambutol by having amino alcohol moiety in the molecule, and yet quite different due<br>
to presence an elaborate linker between the two amine atoms (see Figure 1 for<br>
representative examples). Also, the fact that the 2-Chlorotrityl resins with pre-loaded<br>
amino alcohols are commercially available (Figure 2) and suit well proposed chemistry was<br>
very attractive.<br>
The compounds in the library were prepared on mmol scale in 96-well format in<br>
pools of 10 compounds per well (for the vast majority of the plates). Table 1 (Figure 3)<br>
summarizes data for the synthesized plates.<br>
Solid phase syntheses using amino alcohol pre-loaded resins. Twenty 96-well<br>
plates have been prepared. Four- and five-steps synthetic routes starting from<br>
commercially available amino alcohol pre-loaded resins similar to what had been used to<br>
create our first 100,000 compound library (Scheme 1, Figure 4), were applied to make<br>
targeted diamines (Schemes 2 and 3, Figures 5 and 6 respectivety). There are some<br>
differences in the syntheses: (1) two first steps of the Scheme 1 are abandoned in Schemes<br>
2 and 3; (2) in the Scheme 1, the second amine is introduced into the molecule as a whole<br>
synthon via nucleophilic displacement of C1 function of the linker, while in the Schemes 2<br>
and 3, it proceeds through modification of the existing amino moiety by carbonyl<br>
compounds.<br>
Scheme 2. Acylation of the purchased amino alcohol pre-loaded 2-Chlorotrityl<br>
resins was accomplished via peptide coupling with FMOC protected amino acids in<br>
presence of HATU (0-(7-Azabenzotriazol-!-yl)-N,N,N,N-tetramethyluronium<br>
hexafluorophosphate) and EtN(iso-Pr)2 in DCM/DMF mixture at RT. The reaction was<br>
done twice to improve product yields. The list of the amino acids used to create this library<br>
is shown in the Table 2 (Figure 7).<br>
Deprotection (removal of the FMOC group) was carried out by reaction with<br>
piperidine at RT. Derivatization of the amino group was achieved by reductive alkylation<br>
with 96 various carbonyl compounds, such as aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids, in<br>
the presence of NaBCNH3 at RT for 72-96 h. The selection of the carbonyl compounds was<br>
made so, that the final diamine products would carry the same or similar types of<br>
substituents that had been observed in the hit compounds generated from the previous<br>
library of ethambutol analogs, as well as structural diversity (Figure 8). A complete list of<br>
the carbonyl compounds used is shown in Table 3 (Figure 8).<br>
Reduction of the aminoethyleneamides into corresponding diamines was carried out<br>
using the soluble reducing reagent 65+w% Red-Al at room temperature. Cleavage of the<br>
products from the resin was achieved with a 10% solution of trifluoroacetic acid in<br>
dichloromethane resulting in the formation of TFA salts of the diamines.<br>
For library production the acylation step of the synthetic scheme was carried out<br>
using a Quest 210 Synthesizer on scale of 0.1-0.15 g of resin per tube. Following the<br>
reaction, formed resins were thoroughly washed, dried, and then groups of ten resins were<br>
pooled together. A small amount of each resin (~0.05g) was archived prior to pooling to<br>
facilitate re-synthesis and deconvoration of actives.<br>
Deprotection of the FMOC group, addition of the carbonyl component, reduction,<br>
and cleavage were carried out in 96-well reaction blocks using the Combic lamps system by<br>
Whatman Polyfiltronics or the FlexChem system by Robbins Scientific. A suspension of<br>
the pooled resins in 2:1 mixture of DCM/THF was evenly distributed into one reaction<br>
plate resulting in approximately 10 mg of the resin per well. The 96 diverse carbonyl<br>
compounds were arrayed in one 96-well plate template and added, one carbonyl compound<br>
per well, to each individual pool of ten resins, resulting in an anticipated 960 diamines<br>
produced per plate. Reduction was carried out in the same format and cleavage and<br>
filtering into storage plates was followed by evaporation of the TFA prior to biological<br>
assay.<br>
Quality assessment of the prepared library of diamines was done by Electrospray<br>
Ionization mass spectrometry using two randomly selected rows (16 samples) per plate,<br>
17% of the total number. Successful production of a compound was based on an<br>
appearance of a molecular ion of the calculated mass. Depending on the amino acid that<br>
had been used for tire synthesis, the percentage of the predicted ions were observed and<br>
therefore the predicted compounds were formed, varied from 31-96% (Table 1, Figure 3).<br>
Based on MS analysis, out of targeted 15,360 compounds, 7,500 diamines were actually<br>
formed. Amino acids such as aminomethylcylcohexyl carboxylic acid, thienylalanine, or<br>
phenylalanine produced desirable compounds with good yields (88-96%). At the same<br>
time, some amino acids, such as arginine, tetrahydroisoquinoline carboxylic acid, and<br>
thiazolidine carboxylic acid did not lead to the corresponding products.<br>
Scheme 3. Success in preparation of ethambutol analogs with modified linker<br>
encouraged us to attempt synthesis of another sub-library of diamines using commercially<br>
available ammo-alcohol pre-loaded resins (Scheme 3, Figure 6). This route yields diamine<br>
compounds that are similar to those produced by the (Scheme 2, Figure 5) but that also<br>
possess desirable substiruents at the first nitrogen atom.<br>
We have illustrated this method by starting from commercially available 1,4-<br>
aminobutanol pre-loaded resin. We prepared five plates using five amino acids Phe, Amc,<br>
Cha, Trp, and Inp (Table 1) that gave the best preliminary results in the screening assays<br>
(see number of hits in the Table 1). The very first step was derivatization of the amino<br>
group via reductive alkylation by 10 carbonyl compounds (cyclooctanone, 4-<br>
benzyloxybenzaldehyde, (S)-citronellal, myrtenal, tetrahydro-4H-pyran-4-one,<br>
norcamphor, 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)2-butanone, geranylacetone, 2-decalone, 2-<br>
adamantanone) in presence of NaBCNH3 at RT. The following steps were carried out in a<br>
similar fashion as we reported earlier for the Scheme 2.<br>
Screening the library against M. tuberculosis and deconvolution of the active<br>
mixtures. A high-throughput assay with recombinant mycobacteria containing a promoter<br>
fusion of luciferase to Rv0341, as well as the MICs, has been used to screen this new<br>
compound library of ethambutol analogs, Figure 9.<br>
198 compound mixtures have shown to exhibit anti-TB activity, Table 1 (activity at<br>
deconvolutions. Deconvolutions of all 198 compound mixtures were performed by the<br>
discrete re-synthesis of the diamine compounds in 96-well format using stored archive<br>
resins (prior pooling them together) and the same synthetic Schemes 2 and 3. The same<br>
screening tests were used for every deconvoluted plate. Few carbonyl compounds have<br>
been identified as potent synthons contributing to the anti-TB activity (Figure 5).<br>
Performed deconvolutions revealed 118 hits of novel structures as potent anti-TB<br>
compounds (Table 4), 38 of those compounds were proven to be active in both assays.<br>
Figure 11 provides a list of hit compounds and their structures.<br>
Formulations<br>
Therapeutics, including compositions containing the substituted ethylene diamine<br>
compounds of the present invention, can be prepared in physiologically acceptable<br>
formulations, such as in pharmaceutic ally acceptable carriers, using known techniques. For<br>
example, a substituted ethylene diamine compound is combined with a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipient to form a therapeutic composition.<br>
The compositions of the present inventionrriay. be administered in the form of a<br>
solid, liquid or aerosol. Examples of solid compositions include pills, creams, soaps and<br>
implantable dosage units. Pills may be administered orally. Therapeutic creams and anti-<br>
mycobacteria soaps may be administered topically. Implantable dosage units may be<br>
administered locally, for example, in the lungs, or may be implanted for systematic release<br>
of the therapeutic composition, for example, subcutaneously. Examples of liquid<br>
compositions include formulations adapted for injection intramuscularly, subcutaneously,<br>
intravenously, intraarterially, and formulations for topical and intraocular administration.<br>
Examples of aerosol formulations include inhale'r formulations for administration to the<br>
lungs.<br>
A sustained release matrix, as used herein, is a matrix made of materials, usually<br>
polymers, which are degradable by enzymatic or acid/base hydrolysis, or by dissolution.<br>
Once inserted into the body, the matrix is acted upon by enzymes and body fluids. The<br>
sustained release matrix is chosen desirably from biocompatible materials, including, but<br>
not limited to, liposomes, polylactides, polyglycolide (polymer of glycolic acid),<br>
polylactide co-glycolide (coplymers of lactic acid and glycolic acid), polyanhydrides,<br>
poly(ortho)esters, polypeptides, hyaluronic acid, collagen, chondroitin sulfate, carboxylic<br>
acids, fatty acids, phospholipds, polysaccharides, nucleic acids, polyamino acids, amino<br>
acids such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, isoleucine, polynucleotides, polyvinyl propylene,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone and silicone. A preferred biodegradable matrix is a matrix of one of<br>
either polylactide, polyglycolide,.or polylactide co-glycolide.<br>
The dosage of the composition will depend on the condition being treated, the<br>
particular composition used, and other clinical factors, such as weight and condition of the<br>
patient, and the route of administration. A suitable dosage may range from 100 to 0.1<br>
mg/kg. A more preferred dosage may range from 50 to 0.2 mg/kg. A more preferred<br>
dosage may range from 25 to 0.5 mg/kg. Tablets or other forms of media may contain<br>
from 1 to 1000 mg of the substituted ethylene diamine. Dosage ranges and schedules of<br>
administration similar to ethambutol or other anti-tuberculosis drugs may be used.<br>
The composition may be administered in combination with other compositions and<br>
procedures for the treatment of other disorders occurring in combination with<br>
mycobacterial disease. For example, tuberculosis frequently occurs as a secondary<br>
complication associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Patients<br>
undergoing AIDS treatment, which includes procedures such as surgery, radiation or<br>
chemotherapy, may benefit from the therapeutic methods and compositions described<br>
herein.<br>
The following specific examples will illustrate the invention as it applies to the<br>
particular synthesis of the substituted ethylene diamine compounds, and the in vitro and in<br>
vivo suppression of the growth of colonies of M tuberculosis. In additiona, the teachings<br>
of R. Lee et al. J. Comb. Chem 2003, 5, 172-1S7 are hereby incorporated by reference in<br>
their entirety. It will be appreciated that other examples, including minor variations in<br>
chemical procedures, will be apparent to those skilled in the art, and that the invention is<br>
not limited to these specific illustrated examples.<br>
EXAMPLE I<br>
Generating the Diamine Library from<br>
commercially available amino alcohol pre-loaded resins.<br>
General Methods: All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Amino<br>
alcohol pre-loaded resins were purchased from NovaBiochem. Solvents acetonitrile,<br>
dichloromethane, dimethylformamide, ethylene dichloride, methanol, and tetrahydrofuran<br>
were purchased from Aldrich and used as received. Solid phase syntheses were performed<br>
on Quest 210 Synthesizer (Argonaut Technologies) and combinatorial chemistry<br>
equipment (Whatman Polyfiltronics and Robbins Scientific). Evaporation of the solvents<br>
was done using SpeedVac AES (Savant). Mass spectra data were obtained by Electrospray<br>
Ionization technique on Perkin Elmer/Sciex, API-300, TQMS with an autosampler.<br>
Scheme 2. Description of the Process.<br>
The acylation step was carried out in 5 ml tubes using the Quest 210 Synthesizer.<br>
Removal of the FMOC group, reductive alleviation reaction with carbonyl compounds, the<br>
reduction with Red-Al, and the cleavage from the solid support were carried out in 96-deep<br>
(2ml) well, chemically resistant plates.<br>
Step 1. deviation of amino alcohol pre-loaded resins with amino acids.<br>
Each tube was loaded 0.150 g of corresponding resin (coverage of 0.3-1.0 tnmol/g),<br>
and all resins were pre-swollen in DCM for 1.5 h and filtered. If Fmoc protected resin was<br>
used: the resin was stirred with 2.5 ml of 20% solution of piperidine in DMF for 10 min,<br>
filtered, and washed with 2.5 ml of DMF. The procedure was repeated, but the stirring time<br>
was 20 min. After that all resins were filtered, washed with DMF (1x2.5 ml) and DCM<br>
(2x3ml). Each tube was charged with 1 ml of dichloromethane. Amino acids, 0.38mmol in<br>
1 ml of DMF (2,5 mol excess to loaded resin) were mixed with HATU. 0.3 mmol, 011 g in<br>
0.5 ml of DMF (2 mol excess to loaded resin) and allowed to stay for 1520 min. Then 1.5<br>
ml of mixture acid-HATU were added to each tube following by the addition of solution of<br>
1.5 mmol, 0.26 ml (10 mol excess to loaded resin) of EtNPr2 in 0.5 ml of dichloromethane.<br>
Reaction carried out 8 h at 45 C and 6-8 h at room temperature. After the reaction was<br>
complete, the resins were filtered, washed with 1:1 mixture of DMF and dichloromethane<br>
(1x3ml), dichloromethane (1x3ml), and acylation was repeated with the same amount of<br>
reagents. At the end, the resins were filtered, washed wife 1:1 mixture of DMF and<br>
dichloromethane (1x3ml), methanol (3x3ml), sucked dry (on Quest) for 30 min and<br>
transferred into vials (one resin per vial), and dried in a desiccator under vacuum for Ih.<br>
After this step all resins were subjected for quality control using MS spectra.<br>
Step 2. Alkylation of the amino group.<br>
Deprotection. Ten prepared resins from the first three steps were pooled together,<br>
leaving approximately 0.03 g of each in the individual vials for all necessary<br>
deconvolutions. A suspension of the resin mixture (0.08- 1.0 g) in 100 ml of a 2:1<br>
mixture of dichloromethane and THF was distributed into two 96-well filterplates and<br>
filtered using a filtration manifold. The reaction plates were transferred into combiclamps,<br>
and 0.2 ml of 20% solution of piperidine in DMF was added to remove Fmoc protecting<br>
group and allowed to stay for 10 min. After 10 min plate was fdtered, washed with 0.2 ml<br>
of DMF, and deprotection was repeated with 0.2 ml of 20% solution of piperidine in DMF<br>
and allowed to stay for 20 min. After that plate was filtered, washed with DMF (0.2 ml per<br>
well) and dichloromethane (2x0.5 ml per well).<br>
Reaction with the carbonyl compounds. Each well in row A on the reaction plate<br>
was charged with 0.1 ml of dichloromethane, 0.08ml of ~1.0M solution of appropriate acid<br>
in DMF from master plate, 0.05 ml DMF solution of PyBrop, (0.012 g, 0.025 mmol, 2.5<br>
mol excess to loaded resin) and 0.05 ml of EfNi'Pr2 in dichloromethane (0.017 ml, 0.10<br>
mmol, 10 mol excess to loaded resin). Each well in rows B through H was charged with<br>
0.1 ml of THF, 0.160 ml of~1.0 M solution of appropriate aldehyde or ketone in DMF<br>
from master plate and allowed to react for 30 min. After 30 min 0.075 ml (0.075 mmol) of<br>
1.0 M solution of NaBCNH3 in THF were added. The reaction plates were sealed and kept<br>
at RT for 72h. At the end, the resins were filtered, washed with THF, DCM (1x1m1),<br>
methanol (2xlml) and dried in desiccator under vacuum for 3h.<br>
Step 3. Reduction with Red-Al.<br>
The reaction plates were placed into combiclamps. A 1:6 mixture of Red-Al (65+<br>
w% in toluene) and THF was added, 0.6 ml per well (0.28mmol of Red-Al per well), and<br>
allowed to react for 4 h. After the reaction completion the resins were filtered, washed<br>
with THF (2x1 ml), methanol (3x1 ml) and dried in tire filtration manifold.<br>
Step 4. Cleavage.<br>
This step was carried out using a cleavage manifold. The reaction plates (placed on<br>
the top of the collection plates in this manifold) were charged with a 10:88:2 mixture of<br>
TFA, dichloromethane, and triisopropylsilane, 0.5 ml per well. After 15 min, the solutions<br>
were filtered and collected into proper wells of the collection plates. The procedure was<br>
repeated. Solvents were evaporated on a speedvac, and the residual samples were ready for<br>
testing.<br>
Scheme 3. Description of the Process.<br>
The reductive alkylation step of 4-aminobutan-l ol resin and the acylation stop were<br>
carried out in 5 ml tubes using the Quest 210 Synthesizer. Removal of the FMOC group,<br>
reductive alkylation reaction with carbonyl compounds, the reduction with Red-Al, and the<br>
cleavage from the solid support were carried out in 96-deep (2ml) well, chemically<br>
resistant plates.<br>
Step 1. Reductive alkylation of 4-Aminobutan-l-ol resin.<br>
A suspension of the resin (coverage of 0.3-1.0 mmol/g), 1.0 g (up to 1.0 mmol), in<br>
30 ml of 2:1 mixture of dichloromethane and THF was disitrubuted into 10 tubes, 3 ml per<br>
tube and filtered, than each tube was charged with 0.10 g of resin. Resin was pre swollen in<br>
DCM for 1.5 h and filtered. Each tube were loaded with 1.5 ml 1,2-dichloroethane, 0.3<br>
mmol (3 mol excess) of corresponded aldehyde or ketone (alkylating reagent) and allowed<br>
to react for 30 min. After that 0.3 mmol (0.3 ml) of 1 M solution of NaBCNH3 in THF<br>
were added and reaction was carried out at RT for 48 h. When reaction was completed, all<br>
tubes were filtered, washed with THF (2x3ml), MeOH (3x3ml) and sucked dry (on Quest<br>
for ~30min).<br>
Step 2. Acylation with amino acids.<br>
All tubes were pre washed with DCM twice. Each tube was charged with 1 ml of<br>
dichloromethane. Amino acids, 0.25 mmol in 1 ml of DMF (2,5 mol excess to loaded<br>
resm) were mixed with HATU, 0.2 mmol, 0.076 g in 0.5 ml of DMF (2 mol excess to<br>
loaded resin) and allowed to stay for 15-20 min. Then 1.5 ml of mixture acid-HATU were<br>
added to each tube following by the addition of solution of 1.0 mmol, 0.17 ml (10 mol<br>
excess to loaded resin) of EtNiPr2 in 0.5 ml of dichloromethane. Reaction carried out 8 h at<br>
45 C and 6-S h at room temperature. After 16 h the resins were filtered, washed with 1:1<br>
mixture of DMF and dichloromethane (1x3ml), dichloromethane (1x3ml) and acylation<br>
was repeated with the same amount of reagents. At the end, the resins were filtered, washed<br>
with 1:1 mixture of DMF and dichloromethane (1x3ml), methanol (3x3ml), sucked dry (on<br>
Quest) for 30 min and transferred into vials (one resin per vial), and dried in a desiccator<br>
under vacuum for 1h. After this step all resins were subjected for quality control using MS<br>
spectra.<br>
All following reaction steps, - alkylation of the amino group (Step 3), reduction with Red-Al<br>
(Step 4), and Cleavage (Step 5), - were carried as they were described for the Scheme 2 of<br>
this Application.<br>
Deconvolution<br>
Deconvolution of the active wells was performed by re-synthesis of discrete<br>
compounds, from the archived FMOC-protected -aminoacetamide resins (10 resins, 0.05-<br>
0.10g each), which were set aside at the end of the acylation step before the pooling. Each<br>
resin was assigned a discrete'Column (1, or 2, or 3, etc.) in a 96-well filterplate, and was<br>
divided between X rows (A, B, C, etc), where X is the number of hits discovered in the<br>
original screening plate. To each well, in a row, a selected carbonyl compound (present in<br>
the hit) was added along with other required reagents: the first selected carbonyl compound<br>
was added to the resins in the row "A", the second carbonyl compound- to the resins in<br>
the row "B", the third carbonyl compound- to the resins in the row "C", etc. A lay-out of<br>
a representative 96-well deconvolution plate is shown in Table3, Figure 12.<br>
The reaction plates were sealed and kept at RT for 72h. At the end, the resins were<br>
filtered, washed with THF, DCM (1x1ml), methanol (2x1 ml) and dried in desiccator under<br>
vacuum for 2h. Reduction and cleavage were performed according to steps 5 and 6 of the<br>
synthetic protocol. The product wells from the cleavage were analyzed by ESI-MS<br>
(Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectroscopy) to ensure the identity of the actives, and were<br>
tested in the MIC assay.<br>
Solid Phase Synthesis of Selected Substituted Ethylenediamines<br>
Using the Quest 210 Synthesizer.<br>
The solid phase protocol described above for generating a library of diamine<br>
compounds was applied to the scale-up synthesis of the selected substituted<br>
ethylenediamine compounds. Here, all reaction steps, from the acylation of the<br>
commercially available amino alcohol pre-loaded resins to the cleavage of the final<br>
product, were carried out using Quest instrument only, which allowed for up to twenty<br>
parallel reactions. Purification of all crude samples was done by Flash Chromatography on<br>
CombiFlash (Isco, Inc.) to yield desirable products in purity greater than 90%. Here, the<br>
synthesis of one of the active compounds, l-(2-{[3-(4-cmorophenoxy)benzyl]aminoj-3-<br>
phenylpropyl)piperidin-4-ol, is described below as an example.<br>
The preparation of l-(2-{[3-(4-chlorophenoxy)benzyl]amino}-3-<br>
phenylpropyl)piperidin-4-ol, compound 588.<br><br>
Representative synthesis of active compounds.<br>
Removal of FMOC protective group. Commercially available resin (N-FMOC-<br>
piperidinyl-4-oxy)-(4-methoxyphenyl)methyl polystyrene, coverage (linker) 0.88 mmol/g<br>
 (0.4 g, 0.35 mmol), was placed into one of the 10 ml tubes of Quest 210 Synthesizer. A<br>
solution of piperidine (1.5 ml) in DMF (6 ml) was added and stin'ed for 30 min, filtered,<br>
washed with DMF (1x6 ml), and the addition of piperidine was repeated. The resin was<br>
washed with DMF (1x8 ml) and DCM (2x8ml).<br>
Acylation with FMOC protected L-Phenylalanine . The resin was pre-washed with<br>
 5 ml of DCM for 20 min. FMOC L-Phenylalanine, (.0341 g, 0.88 mmol) in 1 ml of DMF<br>
(2,5 mol excess to loaded resin) were mixed with HATU (0.33 g, 0.88 mmol) in 3 ml of<br>
DMF, and added to the tube following by the addition of solution of 0.6 ml of EtN/Pr2.<br>
Reaction was carried at RT for 20 h. After the reaction was complete, the resin was<br>
filtered, washed with 1:1 mixture of DMF and dichloromethane (1x6ml), dichloromethane<br>
 (Tx6ml), and acylation was repeated with the same amount of reagents. At the end, the<br>
resins were filtered, washed with 1:1 mixture of DMF and dichloromethane (2x6ml).<br>
Removal of FMOCprotective group. A solution of piperidine (1.5 ml) in DMF (6<br>
ml) was added to the resin and formed suspension was stirred for 30 min, filtered, washed<br>
with DMF (1x6 ml), and the addition of piperidine was repeated. The resin was washed<br>
with DMF (lxS ml) and methanol (2x8ml), and sucked dry inder Ar for 20 min.<br>
Reaction with a carbonyl compound. The resin was pre-washed with THF for 30<br>
min, filtered, and charged wjth 6 ml of THF. 3-(4-Chlorophenoxy)-benzaldehyde (0.280<br>
ml, 1.00 mmol) was added followed by addition of 1.0 M solution of NaBCNH3 in THF (1<br>
ml, 1 mmol) after 30 min. The reaction was allowed to proceed at RT for 72h. At the end,<br>
the resin was filtered, washed with THF (1x6ml) and MeOH (2x6ml), and dried under Ar<br>
for 30 min.<br>
Reduction with Red-Al. The resulted resin in a tube was pre-washed with<br>
anhydrous THF (2x6ml) and filtered. The rube was charged with 5 ml of anhydrous THF<br>
followed by addition upon stirring commercially available Red-Al as 65+% in toluene (1<br>
ml, 3.2 mmol). After 4 h the resin was filtered, washed with THF (2xlml) and MeOH<br>
(3xlml) (addition of MeOH should proceed with caution!), and dried under Ar for 10 min.<br>
Cleavage. For this last step of the synthesis the tube with the resin was charged with<br>
DCM (S ml) and TFA (1 ml) and formed bright red suspension was allowed to stir for 30<br>
min. The resin was filtered and the filtrate was collected into a collection tube. The<br>
procedure was repeated. DCM and excess of TFA were evaporated on a speedvac. Crude<br>
l-(2-{[3-(4-chIorophenoxy)benzyl]ammo}-3-phenylpropyl)piperidin-4-ol (in a form of<br>
trufluoroacetate salt) was purified by Flash Chromatography on CombiFlash (Isco) using<br>
following conditions: pre-loaded silica gel column, 12 g, flow 15 ml/'min, 25 min run,<br>
gradient starting with DCM finishing up with DCM/MeOH/NH4OH (600/400/10).<br>
