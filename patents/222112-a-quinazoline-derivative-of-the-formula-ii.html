				<td>CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS<br>
The present invention relates to quinazoline derivatives, processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them as active ingredient, methods for the treatment of disease states associated with angiogenesis and/or increased vascular permeability, to their use as medicaments and to their use in the manufacture of medicaments for use in the production of antiangiogenic and/or vascular permeability reducing effects in warm-blooded animals such as humans.<br>
Normal angiogenesis plays an important role in a variety of processes including embryonic development, wound healing and several components of female reproductive function. Undesirable or pathological angiogenesis has been associated with disease states including diabetic retinopathy, psoriasis, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, atheroma, Kaposi's sarcoma and haemangioma (Fan et al, 1995, Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 16: 57-66; Folkman, 1995, Nature Medicine 1: 27-31). Alteration of vascular permeability is thought to play a role in both normal and pathological physiological processes (Cullinan-Bove et al, 1993, Endocrinology 133: 829-837; Senger et al, 1993, Cancer and Metastasis Reviews, 12: 303-324). Several polypeptides with in vitro endothelial cell growth promoting activity have been identified including, acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors (aFGF &amp; bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). By virtue of the restricted expression of its receptors, the growth factor activity of VEGF, in contrast to that of the FGFs, is relatively specific towards endothelial cells. Recent evidence indicates that VEGF is an important stimulator of both normal and pathological angiogenesis (Jakeman et al, 1993, Endocrinology, 133: 848-859; Kolch et al, 1995, Breast Cancer Research and Treatment, 36:139-155) and vascular permeability (Connolly et al, 1989, J. Biol. Chem. 264: 20017-20024). Antagonism of VEGF action by sequestration of VEGF with antibody can result in inhibition of tumour growth (Kim et al, 1993, Nature 362: 841-844). Basic FGF (bFGF) is a potent stimulator of angiogenesis (e.g. Hayek et al, 1987, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 147: 876-880) and raised levels of FGFs have been found in the serum (Fujimoto et al, 1991, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 180: 386-392) and urine (Nguyen et al, 1993, J. Natl. Cancer. Inst. 85: 241-242) of patients with cancer.<br>
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are important in the transmission of biochemical signals across the plasma membrane of cells. These transmembrane molecules<br><br>
characteristically consist of an extracellular ligand-binding domain connected through a segment in the plasma membrane to an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Binding of ligand to the receptor results in stimulation of the receptor-associated tyrosine kinase activity which leads to phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on both the receptor and other intracellular molecules. These changes in tyrosine phosphorylation initiate a signalling cascade leading to a variety of cellular responses. To date, at least nineteen distinct RTK subfamilies, defined by amino acid sequence homology, have been identified. One of these subfamilies is presently comprised by the fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor, Fit or Fltl, the kinase insert domain-containing receptor, KDR (also referred to as Flk-1), and another fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor, Flt4. Two of these related RTKs, Fit and KDR, have been shown to bind VEGF with high affinity (De Vries et al, 1992, Science 255: 989-991; Terman et al, 1992, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1992, 187: 1579-1586). Binding of VEGF to these receptors expressed in heterologous cells has been associated with changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation status of cellular proteins and calcium fluxes.<br>
The present invention is based on the discovery of compounds that surprisingly inhibit the effects of VEGF, a property of value in the treatment of disease states associated with angiogenesis and/or increased vascular permeability such as cancer, diabetes, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, Kaposi's sarcoma, haemangioma, acute and chronic nephropathies, atheroma, arterial restenosis, autoimmune diseases, acute inflammation, excessive scar formation and adhesions, endometriosis, dysfunctional uterine bleeding and ocular diseases with retinal vessel proliferation. Compounds of the present invention generally possess higher potency against VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase than against epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor tyrosine kinase. Compounds of the invention which have been tested possess activity against VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase such that they may be used in an amount sufficient to inhibit VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase whilst demonstrating no significant activity against EGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Compounds of the present invention generally possess higher potency against VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase than against FGF Rl receptor tyrosine kinase. Compounds of the invention which have been tested possess activity against VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase such that they may be used in an amount sufficient to inhibit VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase whilst demonstrating no significant activity against FGF Rl receptor tyrosine kinase.<br><br>

For the avoidance of doubt it is to be understood that where in this specification a group is qualified by 'hereinbefore defined' or 'defined hereinbefore' the said group encompasses the first occurring and broadest definition as well as each and all of the preferred definitions for that group.<br>
In this specification unless stated otherwise the term "alky!" includes both straight and branched chain alkyl groups but references to individual alkyl groups such as "propyl" are specific for the straight chain version only. An analogous convention applies to other generic terms. Unless otherwise stated the term "alkyl" advantageously refers to chains with 1-6 carbon atoms, preferably 1-4 carbon atoms. The term "alkoxy" as used herein, unless stated otherwise includes "alkyl"-O- groups in which "alkyl" is as hereinbefore defined. The term "aryl" as used herein unless stated otherwise includes reference to a C6.10 aryl group which may, if desired, carry one or more substituents selected from halogeno, alkyl, alkoxy, nitro, trifluoromethyl and cyano, (wherein alkyl and alkoxy are as hereinbefore defined). The term "aryloxy" as used herein unless otherwise stated includes "aryl"-O-groups in which "aryl" is as hereinbefore defined. The term "sulphonyloxy" as used herein refers to alkylsulphonyloxy and arylsulphonyloxy groups in which "alkyl" and "aryl" are as hereinbefore defined. The term "alkanoyl" as used herein unless otherwise stated includes formyl and alkylC=O groups in which "alkyl" is as defined hereinbefore, for example C2alkanoyl is ethanoyl and refers to CH3OO, C,alkanoyl is formyl and refers to CHO. In this specification unless stated otherwise the term "alkenyl" includes both straight and branched chain alkenyl groups but references to individual alkenyl groups such as 2-butenyl are specific for the straight chain version only. Unless otherwise stated the term "alkenyl" advantageously refers to chains with 2-5 carbon atoms, preferably 3-4 carbon atoms. In this specification unless stated otherwise the term "alkynyl" includes both straight and branched chain alkynyl groups but references to individual alkynyl groups such as 2-butynyl are specific for the straight chain version only. Unless otherwise stated the term "alkynyl" advantageously refers to chains with 2-5 carbon<br><br>
atoms, preferably 3-4 carbon atoms. Unless stated otherwise the term "haloalkyl" refers to an alkyl group as defined hereinbefore which bears one or more halogeno groups, such as for example trifluoromethyl.<br>
For the avoidance of any doubt, where R2 has a value of substituted or unsubstituted C|.5alkyl, R2 has been selected from CN3alkyl or from a group R5X' wherein X1 is a direct bond or -CH2- and R5 is C,.5alkyl which may be unsubstituted or which may be substituted with one or more groups selected from hydroxy, fluoro, chloro, bromo and amino.<br>
Within the present invention it is to be understood that a compound of the formula I or a salt thereof may exhibit the phenomenon of tautomerism and that the formulae drawings within this specification can represent only one of the possible tautomeric forms. It is to be understood that the invention encompasses any tautomeric form which inhibits VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity and is not to be limited merely to any one tautomeric form utilised within the formulae drawings. The formulae drawings within this specification can represent only one of the possible tautomeric forms and it is to be understood that the specification encompasses all possible tautomeric forms of the compounds drawn not just those forms which it has been possible to show graphically herein.<br>
It will be appreciated that compounds of the formula I or a salt thereof may possess an asymmetric carbon atom. Such an asymmetric carbon atom is also involved in the tautomerism described above, and it is to be understood that the present invention encompasses any chiral form (including both pure enantiomers, scalemic and racemic mixtures) as well as any tautomeric form which inhibits VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity, and is not to be limited merely to any one tautomeric form or chiral form utilised within the formulae drawings. It is to be understood that the invention encompasses all optical and diastereomers which inhibit VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity. It is further to be understood that in the names of chiral compounds (R,S) denotes any scalemic or racemic mixture while (R) and (5) denote the enantiomers. In the absence of (R,S), (R) or (S) in the name it is to be understood that the name refers to any scalemic or racemic mixture, wherein a scalemic mixture contains R and S enantiomers in any relative proportions and a racemic mixture contains R and S enantiomers in the ration 50:50.<br>
It is also to be understood that certain compounds of the formula I and salts thereof can exist in solvated as well as unsolvated forms such as, for example, hydrated forms. It is to<br><br>
be understood that the invention encompasses all such solvated forms which inhibit VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity.<br>
For the avoidance of any doubt, it is to be understood that when X1 is, for example, a group of formula -NR6C(O)-, it is the nitrogen atom bearing the R6 group which is attached to the quinazoline ring and the carbonyl (C(O)) group is attached to R5, whereas when X1 is, for example, a group of formula -C(O)NR7-, it is the carbonyl group which is attached to the quinazoline ring and the nitrogen atom bearing the R7 group is attached to R5. A similar convention applies to the other two atom X1 linking groups such as -NR9SO2- and -SO2NR8-. When X1 is -NR'°- it is the nitrogen atom bearing the R10 group which is linked to the quinazoline ring and to R5. An analogous convention applies to other groups. It is further to be understood that when X1 represents -NR'°- and R'° is C,.3alkoxyC2.3alkyl it is the C2.3alkyl moiety which is linked to the nitrogen atom of X1 and an analogous convention applies to other groups.<br>
For the avoidance of any doubt, it is to be understood that in a compound of the formula I when R5 is, for example, a group of formula C|.3alkylX9C,.3alkylR29, it is the terminal C,.3alkyl moiety which is linked to X1, similarly when R5 is, for example, a group of formula C2.5alkenylR28 it is the C2.5alkenyl moiety which is linked to X1 and an analogous convention applies to other groups. When R5 is a group l-R29prop-l-en-3-yl it is the first carbon to which the group R29 is attached and it is the third carbon which is linked to X1 and an analogous convention applies to other groups.<br>
For the avoidance of any doubt, it is to be understood that in a compound of the formula I when R5 is, for example, R28 and R28 is a pyrrolidinyl ring which bears a group -(-O-)^CMalkyl)gringD, it is the -O- or CMalkyl which is linked to the pyrrolidinyl ring, unless f and g are both 0 when it is ring D which is linked to the pyrrolidinyl ring and an analogous convention applies to other groups.<br>
For the avoidance of any doubt, it is to be understood that when R29 carries a C,. 4aminoalkyl substituent it is the C,.4alkyl moiety which is attached to R29 whereas when R29 carries a C,.4alkylamino substituent it is the amino moiety which is attached to R29 and an analogous convention applies to other groups.<br>
For the avoidance of any doubt, it is to be understood that when R28 carries a C,. 4alkoxyC|.4alkyl substituent it is the CMalkyl moiety which is attached to R28 and an analogous convention applies to other groups.<br><br>
The present invention relates to the compounds of formula I as hereinbefore defined as well as to the salts thereof. Salts for use in pharmaceutical compositions will be pharmaceutically acceptable salts, but other salts may be useful in the production of the compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the invention may, for example, include acid addition salts of the compounds of formula I as hereinbefore defined which are sufficiently basic to form such salts. Such acid addition salts include for example salts with inorganic or organic acids affording pharmaceutically acceptable anions such as with hydrogen halides (especially hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid of which hydrochloric acid is particularly preferred) or with sulphuric or phosphoric acid, or with trifluoroacetic, citric or maleic acid. In addition where the compounds of formula I are sufficiently acidic, pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be formed with an inorganic or organic base which affords a pharmaceutically acceptable cation. Such salts with inorganic or organic bases include for example an alkali metal salt, such as a sodium or potassium salt, an alkaline earth metal salt such as a calcium or magnesium salt, an ammonium salt or for example a salt with methylarnine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, piperidine, morpholine or tris-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine.<br>
A compound of the formula I, or salt thereof, and other compounds of the invention (as hereinafter defined) may be prepared by any process known to be applicable to the preparation of chemically-related compounds. Such processes include, for example, those illustrated in European Patent Applications Publication Nos. 0520722, 0566226, 0602851 and 0635498. Such processes also include, for example, solid phase synthesis. Such processes, are provided as a further feature of the invention and are as described hereinafter. Necessary starting materials may be obtained by standard procedures of organic chemistry. The preparation of such starting materials is described within the accompanying non-limiting Examples. Alternatively necessary starting materials are obtainable by analogous procedures to those illustrated which are within the ordinary skill of an organic chemist.<br>

The reaction of the compounds of formulae XVII and VI is conveniently effected under conditions as described for process (b) hereinbefore.<br>
The compounds of formula III and salts thereof wherein at least one R2 is R5X' and wherein X1 is -CH2- may be prepared for example as described above from a compound of the formula XV (in which R2 is -CH3) or XIII (in which HX1- is -CH3), by radical bromination or chlorination to give a -CH2Br or -CH2C1 group which may then be reacted with a compound of the formula R5-H under standard conditions for such substitution reactions.<br>

The reaction may be conveniently effected under conditions as described for process (b) hereinbefore.<br>
The compounds of formula XVIII and salts thereof may for example be prepared by deprotecting a compound of the formula XIX:<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
 (wherein R2, s and L2 are as hereinbefore defined, P1 is a protecting group and X1 is as hereinbefore defined in the section describing compounds of the formula XVIII). The choice of protecting group P1 is within the standard knowledge of an organic chemist, for example those included in standard texts such as "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" T.W. Greene and R.G.M.Wuts, 2nd Ed. Wiley 1991, including N-sulphonyl derivatives (for example, p-toluenesulphonyl), carbamates (for example, t-butyl carbonyl), N-alkyl derivatives (for example, 2-chloroethyl, benzyl) and amino acetal derivatives (for example benzyloxymethyl). The removal of such a protecting group may be effected by any of the procedures known for such a transformation, including those reaction conditions indicated in standard texts such as that indicated hereinbefore, or by a related procedure.

One compound of formula III may if desired be converted into another compound of formula III in which the moiety L' is different. Thus for example a compound of formula III in which L1 is other than halogeno, for example optionally substituted phenoxy, may be converted to a compound of formula III in which L1 is halogeno by hydrolysis of a compound of formula III (in which L1 is other than halogeno) to yield a compound of formula XI as hereinbefore defined, followed by introduction of halide to the compound of formula XI, thus obtained as hereinbefore defined, to yield a compound of formula III in which L1 represents halogen.<br>

Many of the intermediates defined herein, for example, those of the formulae V, VII, IX and XX are novel and these are provided as a further feature of the invention. The preparation of these compounds is as described herein and/or is by methods well known to persons skilled in the art of organic chemistry.<br>
The identification of compounds which potently inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity associated with VEGF receptors such as Fit and/or KDR and which inhibit angiogenesis and/or increased vascular permeability is desirable and is the subject of the present invention. These properties may be assessed, for example, using one or more of the procedures set out below: (a) In Vitro Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibition Test<br>
This assay determines the ability of a test compound to inhibit tyrosine kinase activity. DNA encoding VEGF, FGF or EGF receptor cytoplasmic domains may be obtained by total gene synthesis (Edwards M, International Biotechnology Lab 5(3), 19-25, 1987) or by cloning. These may then be expressed in a suitable expression system to obtain polypeptide with tyrosine kinase activity. For example VEGF, FGF and EGF receptor cytoplasmic domains, which were obtained by expression of recombinant protein in insect cells, were found to display intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. In the case of the VEGF receptor Fit (Genbank accession number X51602), a 1.7kb DNA fragment encoding most of the cytoplasmic domain, commencing with methionine 783 and including the termination codon, described by Shibuya et al (Oncogene, 1990, 5: 519-524), was isolated from cDNA and cloned into a baculovirus transplacement vector (for example pAcYMl (see The Baculovirus Expression System: A Laboratory Guide, L.A. King and R. D. Possee, Chapman and Hall, 1992) or pAc360 or pBlueBacHis (available from Invitrogen Corporation)). This recombinant construct was co-transfected into insect cells (for example Spodoptera frugiperda 21(Sf21)) with viral DNA (eg Pharmingen BaculoGold) to prepare recombinant baculovirus. (Details of the methods for the assembly of recombinant DNA molecules and the preparation and use of recombinant baculovirus can be found in standard texts for example Sambrook et al, 1989, Molecular cloning - A Laboratory Manual, 2nd edition, Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press and O'Reilly et al, 1992, Baculovirus Expression Vectors - A Laboratory Manual, W. H.<br><br>
Freeman and Co, New York). For other tyrosine kinases for use in assays, cytoplasmic fragments starting from methionine 806 (KDR, Genbank accession number L04947), methionine 668 (EOF receptor, Genbank accession number X00588) and methionine 399 (FGF Rl receptor, Genbank accession number X51803) may be cloned and expressed in a similar manner.<br>
For expression of cFlt tyrosine kinase activity, Sf21 cells were infected with plaque-pure cFlt recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 3 and harvested 48 hours later. Harvested cells were washed with ice cold phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) (lOmM sodium phosphate pH7.4, 138mM sodium chloride, 2.7mM potassium chloride) then resuspended in ice cold HNTG/PMSF (20mM Hepes pH7.5, 150mM sodium chloride, 10% v/v glycerol, 1% v/v Triton XI00, 1.5mM magnesium chloride, ImM ethylene glycol-bis(paminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), ImM PMSF (phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride); the PMSF is added just before use from a freshly-prepared lOOmM solution in methanol) using 1ml HNTG/PMSF per 10 million cells. The suspension was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 13,000 rpm at 4°C, the supernatant (enzyme stock) was removed and stored in aliquots at -70°C. Each new batch of stock enzyme was titrated in the assay by dilution with enzyme diluent (lOOmM Hepes pH 7.4, 0.2mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% v/v Triton XI00, 0.2mM dithiothreitol). For a typical batch, stock enzyme is diluted 1 in 2000 with enzyme diluent and 50^1 of dilute enzyme is used for each assay well.<br>
A stock of substrate solution was prepared from a random copolymer containing tyrosine, for example Poly (Glu, Ala, Tyr) 6:3:1 (Sigma P3899), stored as 1 mg/ml stock in PBS at -20°C and diluted 1 in 500 with PBS for plate coating.<br>
On the day before the assay 100|ul of diluted substrate solution was dispensed into all wells of assay plates (Nunc maxisorp 96-well immunoplates) which were sealed and left overnight at 4°C.<br>
On the day of the assay the substrate solution was discarded and the assay plate wells were washed once with PBST (PBS containing 0.05% v/v Tween 20) and once with 50mM Hepes pH7.4.<br>
Test compounds were diluted with 10% dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) and 25ul of diluted compound was transferred to wells in the washed assay plates. "Total" control wells contained 10% DMSO instead of compound. Twenty five microlitres of 40mM manganese(II)chloride containing 8uM adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) was added to all test<br><br>
wells except "blank" control wells which contained manganese(II)chloride without ATP. To start the reactions 50ul of freshly diluted enzyme was added to each well and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes. The liquid was then discarded and the wells were washed twice with PBST. One hundred microlitres of mouse IgG anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc. product 05-321), diluted 1 in 6000 with PBST containing 0.5% w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA), was added to each well and the plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature before discarding the liquid and washing the wells twice with PBST. One hundred microlitres of horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-linked sheep anti-mouse Ig antibody (Amersham product NXA 931), diluted 1 in 500 with PBST containing 0.5% w/v BSA, was added and the plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature before discarding the liquid and washing the wells twice with PBST. One hundred microlitres of 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) solution, freshly prepared using one 50mg ABTS tablet (Boehringer 1204 521) in 50ml freshly prepared 50mM phosphate-citrate buffer pHS.O + 0.03% sodium perborate (made with 1 phosphate citrate buffer with sodium perborate (PCSB) capsule (Sigma P4922) per 100ml distilled water), was added to each well. Plates were then incubated for 20-60 minutes at room temperature until the optical density value of the "total" control wells, measured at 405nm using a plate reading spectrophotometer, was approximately 1.0. "Blank" (no ATP) and "total" (no compound) control values were used to determine the dilution range of test compound which gave 50% inhibtion of enzyme activity.<br>
(V) In Vitro HUVEC Proliferation Assay<br>
This assay determines the ability of a test compound to inhibit the growth factor-stimulated proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC).<br>
HUVEC cells were isolated in MCDB 131 (Gibco BRL) + 7.5% v/v foetal calf serum (PCS) and were plated out (at passage 2 to 8), in MCDB 131+ 2% v/v PCS + 3ug/ml heparin + 1 j^g/ml hydrocortisone, at a concentration of 1000 cells/well in 96 well plates. After a minimum of 4 hours they were dosed with the appropriate growth factor (i.e. VEGF 3ng/ml, EGF 3ng/ml or b-FGF 0.3ng/ml) and compound. The cultures were then incubated for 4 days at 37°C with 7.5% CO2. On day 4 the cultures were pulsed with luCi/well of tritiated-thymidine (Amersham product TRA 61) and incubated for 4 hours. The cells were harvested using a 96-well plate harvester (Tomtek) and then assayed for incorporation of<br><br>
tritium with a Beta plate counter. Incorporation of radioactivity into cells, expressed as cpm, was used to measure inhibition of growth factor-stimulated cell proliferation by compounds.<br>
(c) In Vivo Solid Tumour Disease Model<br>
This test measures the capacity of compounds to inhibit solid tumour growth.<br>
CaLu-6 tumour xenografts were established in the flank of female athymic Swiss nu/nu mice, by subcutaneous injection of 1x106 CaLu-6 cells/mouse in lOOul of a 50% (v/v) solution of Matrigel in serum free culture medium. Ten days after cellular implant, mice were allocated to groups of 8-10, so as to achieve comparable group mean volumes. Tumours were measured using vernier calipers and volumes were calculated as: (/ x w) x V(/ x w) x (71/6), where / is the longest diameter and w the diameter perpendicular to the longest. Test compounds were administered orally once daily for a minimum of 21 days, and control animals received compound diluent. Tumours were measured twice weekly. The level of growth inhibition was calculated by comparison of the mean tumour volume of the control group versus the treatment group using a Student T test and/or a Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test. The inhibitory effect of compound treatment was considered significant when p
According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound of the formula I as defined hereinbefore or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier.<br>
The composition may be in a form suitable for oral administration, for example as a tablet or capsule, for parenteral injection (including intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular or infusion) for example as a sterile solution, suspension or emulsion, for topical administration for example as an ointment or cream or for rectal administration for example as a suppository. In general the above compositions may be prepared in a conventional manner using conventional excipients.<br>
The compositions of the present invention are advantageously presented in unit dosage form. The compound will normally be administered to a warm-blooded animal at a unit dose within the range 5-5000mg per square metre body area of the animal, i.e. approximately 0.1-100mg/kg. A unit dose in the range, for example, l-100mg/kg, preferably l-50mg/kg is envisaged and this normally provides a therapeutically-effective dose. A unit<br><br>
dose form such as a tablet or capsule will usually contain, for example l-250mg of active ingredient.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a compound of the formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as defined hereinbefore for use in a method of treatment of the human or animal body by therapy.<br>
We have found that compounds of the present invention inhibit VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity and are therefore of interest for their antiangiogenic effects and/or their ability to cause a reduction in vascular permeability.<br>
A further feature of the present invention is a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for use as a medicament, conveniently a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for use as a medicament for producing an antiangiogenic and/or vascular permeability reducing effect in a warm-blooded animal such as a human being.<br>
Thus according to a further aspect of the invention there is provided the use of a compound of the formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in the manufacture of a medicament for use in the production of an antiangiogenic and/or vascular permeability reducing effect in a warm-blooded animal such as a human being.<br>
According to a further feature of the invention there is provided a method for producing an antiangiogenic and/or vascular permeability reducing effect in a warm-blooded animal, such as a human being, in need of such treatment which comprises administering to said animal an effective amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as defined hereinbefore.<br>
As stated above the size of the dose required for the therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of a particular disease state will necessarily be varied depending on the host treated, the route of administration and the severity of the illness being treated. Preferably a daily dose in the range of l-50mg/kg is employed. However the daily dose will necessarily be varied depending upon the host treated, the particular route of administration, and the severity of the illness being treated. Accordingly the optimum dosage may be determined by the practitioner who is treating any particular patient.<br>
The antiangiogenic and/or vascular permeability reducing treatment defined hereinbefore may be applied as a sole therapy or may involve, in addition to a compound of the invention, one or more other substances and/or treatments. Such conjoint treatment may<br><br>
be achieved by way of the simultaneous, sequential or separate administration of the individual components of the treatment. In the field of medical oncology it is normal practice to use a combination of different forms of treatment to treat each patient with cancer. In medical oncology the other component(s) of such conjoint treatment in addition to the antiangiogenic and/or vascular permeability reducing treatment defined hereinbefore may be: surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Such chemotherapy may cover three main categories of therapeutic agent:<br>
(i) other antiangiogenic agents that work by different mechanisms from those defined hereinbefore (for example linomide, inhibitors of integrin avp3 function, angiostatin, razoxin, thalidomide), and including vascular targeting agents (for example combretastatin phosphate and the vascular damaging agents described in International Patent Application Publication No. WO 99/02166 the entire disclosure of which document is incorporated herein by reference, (for example N-acetylcolchinol-O-phosphate));<br>
(ii) cytostatic agents such as antioestrogens (for example tamoxifen,toremifene, raloxifene, droloxifene, iodoxyfene), progestogens (for example megestrol acetate), aromatase inhibitors (for example anastrozole, letrazole, vorazole, exemestane), antiprogestogens, antiandrogens (for example flutamide, nilutamide, bicalutamide, cyproterone acetate), LHRH agonists and antagonists (for example goserelin acetate, luprolide), inhibitors of testosterone 5a-dihydroreductase (for example finasteride), anti-invasion agents (for example metalloproteinase inhibitors like marimastat and inhibitors of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor function) and inhibitors of growth factor function, (such growth factors include for example platelet derived growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor such inhibitors include growth factor antibodies, growth factor receptor antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors and serine/threonine kinase inhibitors); and<br>
(iii) antiproliferative/antineoplastic drugs and combinations thereof, as used in medical oncology, such as antimetabolites (for example antifolates like methotrexate, fluoropyrimidines like 5-fluorouracil, purine and adenosine analogues, cytosine arabinoside); antitumour antibiotics (for example anthracyclines like doxorubicin, daunomycin, epirubicin and idarubicin, mitomycin-C, dactinomycin, mimramycin); platinum derivatives (for example cisplatin, carboplatin); alkylating agents (for example nitrogen mustard, melphalan, chlorambucil, busulphan, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, nitrosoureas, thiotepa); antimitotic agents (for example vinca alkaloids like vincristine and taxoids like taxol, taxotere);<br><br>
topoisomerase inhibitors (for example epipodophyllotoxins like etoposide and teniposide,<br>
amsacrine, topotecan, and also irinotecan); also enzymes (for example asparaginase); and<br>
thymidylate synthase inhibitors (for example raltitrexed);<br>
and additional types of chemotherapeutic agent include:<br>
(iv) biological response modifiers (for example interferon); and<br>
(v) antibodies (for example edrecolomab).<br>
For example such conjoint treatment may be achieved by way of the simultaneous, sequential or separate administration of a compound of formula I as defined hereinbefore, and a vascular targeting agent described in WO 99/02166 such as N-acetylcolchinol-O-phosphate (Exampe 1 of WO 99/02166).<br>
As stated above the compounds defined in the present invention are of interest for their antiangiogenic and/or vascular permeability reducing effects. Such compounds of the invention are expected to be useful in a wide range of disease states including cancer, diabetes, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, Kaposi's sarcoma, haemangioma, acute and chronic nephropathies, atheroma, arterial restenosis, autoimmune diseases, acute inflammation, excessive scar formation and adhesions, endometriosis, dysfunctional uterine bleeding and ocular diseases with retinal vessel proliferation. In particular such compounds of the invention are expected to slow advantageously the growth of primary and recurrent solid tumours of, for example, the colon, breast, prostate, lungs and skin. More particularly such compounds of the invention are expected to inhibit the growth of those primary and recurrent solid tumours which are associated with VEGF, especially those tumours which are significantly dependent on VEGF for their growth and spread, including for example, certain tumours of the colon, breast, prostate, lung, vulva and skin.<br>
In addition to their use in therapeutic medicine, the compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are also useful as pharmacological tools in the development and standardisation of in vitro and in vivo test systems for the evaluation of the effects of inhibitors of VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity in laboratory animals such as cats, dogs, rabbits, monkeys, rats and mice, as part of the search for new therapeutic agents.<br>
