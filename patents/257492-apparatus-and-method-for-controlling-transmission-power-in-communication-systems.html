BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a cellular communication system, and<br>
more particularly, to an apparatus and a method for controlling transmission<br>
power in an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) cellular<br>
communication system using a multiple frequency reuse factor.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Recent developments in wireless networks focus on a 4th Generation (4G)<br>
communication systems that provides superior Quality of Service (QoS) at a<br>
higher transmission rate. In particular, the focus is on providing subscribers with<br>
high speed services by ensuring mobility and QoS to wireless Local Area<br>
Network (LAN) communication systems and wireless Metropolitan Area<br>
Network (MAN) communication systems, which network topologies that can<br>
provide services at a relatively high transmission rate.<br>
To support broadband transmission networks for a physical channel of the<br>
wireless MAN communication system, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics<br>
Engineers (IEEE) has suggested using an Orthogonal Frequency Division<br>
Multiplexing (OFDM) scheme and an OFDMA scheme with an IEEE 802.16a<br>
communication system. According to the IEEE 802.16a communication system,<br>
the OFDM/OFDMA schemes are applied to the wireless MAN system to transmit<br>
a physical channel signal at a high transmission rate by using a plurality of sub-<br>
carriers.<br>
The IEEE 802.16a communication system is based on a single cell<br>
structure without taking mobility of a Subscriber Station (SS) into consideration.<br>
In contrast, an IEEE 802.16e communication system does take mobility of the SS<br>
into consideration while still incorporating the features of the IEEE 802.16a<br>
communication system.<br>
The IEEE 802.16e communication system reflects the mobility of the SS<br>
under a multi-cell environment. To provide mobility to the SS under the multi-cell<br><br>
environment, the operational relationship between the SS and a Base Station (BS)<br>
must be changed. To that end, research focuses on SS handover. A mobile SS is<br>
referred to as a Mobile Subscriber Station (MSS).<br>
Hereinafter, a conventional IEEE 802.16e communication system will be<br>
described with reference to FIG. 1.<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic view illustrating the structure of a conventional<br>
IEEE 802.16e communication system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the conventional IEEE 802.16e communication<br>
system has a multi-cell structure including a cell 100 and a cell 150. The<br>
conventional IEEE 802.16e communication system includes a BS 110 for<br>
managing the cell 100, a BS 140 for managing the cell 150, and a plurality of<br>
MSSs 111, 113, 130, 151 and 153. The BSs 110 and 140 communicate with the<br>
MSSs 111, 113, 130, 151 and 153 through the OFDM/OFDM A schemes.<br>
The conventional IEEE 802.16e communication system performs an<br>
Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) and uses 1702 sub-carriers. Among the<br>
1702 sub-carriers, 166 sub-carriers are used as pilot sub-carriers and 1536 sub-<br>
carriers are used as data sub-carriers. In addition, the 1536 sub-carriers are<br>
divided into 32 sub-channels, each including 48 sub-carriers. The sub-channels<br>
are allocated to the MSSs according to the state of the system. Herein, the sub-<br>
channel is a channel with at least one sub-carrier. For instance, 48 sub-carriers<br>
may form one sub-channel.<br>
As mentioned above, when the sub-channels are formed in the IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system, the total sub-channels are divided into several<br>
groups and mutually different frequency reuse factors are applied to each group.<br>
Hereinafter, a method of allocating frequency resources based on multiple<br>
frequency reuse factors in the conventional IEEE 802.16e communication system<br>
will be described with reference to FIG. 2.<br>
FIG. 2 is a schematic view illustrating a frequency resource allocation<br>
operation based on multiple frequency reuse factors in the conventional IEEE<br>
802.16e cellular communication system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, a cell center region 200 adjacent to a BS has a relatively high<br>
signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR), so a frequency resource with a<br><br>
frequency reuse factor of 1 is allocated to an MSS located in the cell center region<br>
200. In contrast, a cell boundary region 250, which is relatively remote from the<br>
BS, has a relatively low SINR, so a frequency resource with a frequency reuse<br>
factor greater than 1 (K&gt;1) is allocated to the MSS located in the cell boundary<br>
region 250. By allocating the frequency resources to the MSSs with mutually<br>
different frequency reuse factors, limited frequency resources are used more<br>
effectively and efficiently.<br>
Hereinafter, a method for creating the sub-channels based on the multiple<br>
frequency reuse factors in the conventional IEEE 802.16e communication system<br>
will be described with reference to FIG. 3.<br>
FIG. 3 is a schematic view illustrating a procedure of creating the sub-<br>
channels based on multiple frequency reuse factors in the conventional IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, if the IEEE 802.16e communication system uses N<br>
sub-carriers, the N sub-carriers are divided into G groups. Each of the G groups<br>
consists of S sub-carriers, so that the following equation is satisfied.<br>
N = S x G.<br>
A first sub-channel is created by selecting one sub-carrier from each of<br>
the G groups. A second sub-channel is created by selecting one sub-carrier from<br>
each of the G groups, except for the sub-carrier allocated to the first sub-channel.<br>
The above procedure may be repeated until all sub-carriers of the G groups are<br>
allocated to the sub-channels. As a result, a set of S sub-channels is created.<br>
It is also possible to create a new set of S sub-channels having sub-<br>
carriers different from the above sub-carriers by varying the sub-carrier selection<br>
scheme. The number of sets of the S sub-channels including mutually different<br>
sub-carriers is (S!)G. Herein, a combination of the sub-carriers forming the sub-<br>
channel will be referred to as a "sub-carrier combination".<br>
In the following description, a set of nth sub-channels selected from<br>
among the (S!)G sets of the S sub-channels is defined as An and an mth sub-<br>
channel of the sub-channel set An is defined as SCmn . Herein, n =[0, (S!)G], and<br>
m = [0, S-1]. S sub-channels (SCnm and SCn) forming the same sub-channel set<br>
An are orthogonal to each other. So, the sub-carriers forming each of the S sub-<br><br>
channels may not collide with each other. In addition, the sub-channels (SCmn<br>
and SClk ,n≠k) forming mutually different sets of the sub-channels are aligned<br>
without ensuring orthogonality therebetween; the sub-carriers forming mutually<br>
different sub-channels may collide with each other.<br>
In addition, C sub-channel sets An are selected from among the (S!)G sets<br>
of the S sub-channels. At this time, if a predetermined sub-channel is selected<br>
from each of the C sub-channel sets An, the number of sub-carriers having the<br>
collision characteristics can be uniform. As a result, the total number of sub-<br>
carriers with collision characteristics between two sub-channel sets is<br>
proportional to the number of sub-channels; the sub-channel set is created by<br>
selecting sub-carriers from among the (S!) sets of the S sub-channels. The C<br>
sub-channel sets with mutually different sub-carrier combinations, and the sub-<br>
carriers with uniform collision characteristics can be created through various<br>
schemes.<br>
Hereinafter, a method of managing the sub-channel with a frequency<br>
reuse factor of 1 in the IEEE 802.16e communication system will be described.<br>
First, when the frequency reuse factor is 1, all sub-carriers in a<br>
predetermined cell of the IEEE 802.16e communication system (that is, all sub-<br>
channels) can be used in adjacent cells. If each the cells uses a sub-channel set<br>
having the same sub-carrier combination (that is, if each cell uses the same An),<br>
interference variation may occur in each sub-channel of the sub-channel set<br>
depending on the channel states. Therefore, when presently measured channel<br>
information is applied to a next time duration, it is impossible to predict the<br>
channel state.<br>
Hereinafter, a method of creating the sub-channel when the frequency<br>
reuse factor is 1 in the IEEE 802.16e communication system will be described<br>
with reference to FIGS. 4A and 4B.<br>
FIG. 4A is a schematic view illustrating a procedure of creating the sub-<br>
channel when the frequency reuse factor is 1 in the conventional IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4A, if the IEEE 802.16e communication system uses N<br>
sub-carriers, C sub-channel sets An can be created from the N sub-carriers through<br><br>
various sub-carrier selection schemes.<br>
FIG. 4B is a schematic view illustrating a sub-channel set corresponding<br>
to FIG. 4A allocated to cells forming the IEEE 802.16e communication system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4B, the C sub-channel sets An are allocated to the cells<br>
of the IEEE 802.16e communication system. Each sub-channel of the C sub-<br>
channel sets An is orthogonal to the other sub-channels in the same sub-channel<br>
set while representing the uniform collision characteristics with respect to the<br>
sub-channels of different sub-channel sets.<br>
If the C sub-channel sets An are allocated to each cell, the interference<br>
component from the adjacent cells can be averaged due to the uniform collision<br>
characteristics of the sub-carriers. So, if the amount of resources used in the<br>
adjacent cells is not changed, the validity of channel state information measured<br>
in a predetermined time unit can be maintained. In this manner, the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system can effectively manage the sub-channel based on the<br>
frequency reuse factor of 1. And although the inter-cell interference can be<br>
averaged, the SINR may be reduced from the interference components of adjacent<br>
cells. In particular, the SINR of the cell boundary region is significantly reduced.<br>
Error correction coding with very low rate and modulation schemes with<br>
lower modulation order can be applied to the MSS located in the cell boundary<br>
region to ensure service coverage of the wireless cellular communication system.<br>
However, such error correction coding may degrade bandwidth efficiency,<br>
thereby significantly lowering the transmission rate for the MSS in the cell<br>
boundary region.<br>
The IEEE 802.16e communication system with the frequency reuse factor<br>
K uses K unique frequency bands. Alternatively, the system logically divides the<br>
sub-carriers included in one frequency band into K sub-carrier groups. In<br>
accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the sub-carriers<br>
included in one frequency band are divided into K sub-carrier groups and the<br>
frequency reuse factor K is managed based on the K sub-carrier groups.<br>
Hereinafter, a procedure of creating the sub-channel in the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system based on the frequency reuse factor K will be described<br>
with reference to FIGS. 5A and 5B.<br><br>
FIG. 5A is a schematic view illustrating the procedure of creating the sub-<br>
carrier in the IEEE 802.16e communication system based on the frequency reuse<br>
factor of K.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5A, the sub-carriers formed in one frequency band are<br>
divided into K sub-carrier groups and the frequency reuse factor K is managed<br>
based on the K sub-carrier groups. In FIG. 5A, the frequency reuse factor is 3<br>
(K=3). S sub-channels forming a predetermined sub-channel set An are divided<br>
into three exclusive sub-channel groups defined as Aαn, Aβn ,and Aγn .<br>
FIG. 5B is a schematic view illustrating a group of sub-carriers<br>
corresponding to FIG. 5A allocated to sectors forming the cell of the IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5B, under the frequency reuse factor of 3, three sub-<br>
channel groups Aαn, Aβn ,and Aγn are allocated to equal sectors of each cell. In an<br>
ideal case, inter-cell/sector interference rarely occurs so that the average<br>
transmission rate of the MSS located in the boundary region of the cell or sector<br>
may increase. However, the resources allocated to each cell or sector is reduced<br>
to 1/3, so the capacity of the cell or sector is reduced.<br>
Hereinafter, a method of employing the frequency reuse factors 1 and K<br>
for improving bandwidth efficiency and system capacity of the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system will be described.<br>
As described above with reference to FIG. 2, if the MSSs are located<br>
adjacent to the BS, relatively weak interference is applied to the MSSs in the cell<br>
center region. The MSSs in the cell center region may operate based on the<br>
frequency reuse factor of 1. In contrast, the MSSs located in the cell boundary<br>
region may operate with K&gt;1 to reduce the interference applied to the MSSs from<br>
the adjacent cell or sector. That is, when simultaneously employing the<br>
frequency reuse factors 1 and K in the same cell, the interference in the boundary<br>
region of the cell/sector can be reduced by employing the frequency reuse factor 1<br>
and the system capacity of the BS can be improved by employing the frequency<br>
reuse factor K.<br>
However, if the IEEE 802.16e communication system employs the<br>
frequency reuse factors 1 and K without physically discriminating them, a<br><br>
relatively large interference component results. As a result, the SINR of the<br>
MSS having the frequency reuse factor K may be reduced and performance<br>
thereof will be significantly degraded. To solve the above problem, orthogonality<br>
is ensured between frequency resources having mutually different frequency<br>
reuse factors.<br>
Hereinafter, a procedure of allocating frequency resources based on<br>
multiple frequency reuse factors in the IEEE 802.16e communication system will<br>
be described with reference to FIG. 6.<br>
FIG. 6 is a schematic view illustrating the procedure of allocating the<br>
frequency resources based on multiple frequency reuse factors in the IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, if the IEEE 802.16e communication system uses N<br>
sub-carriers, the N sub-carriers are divided into G groups. Herein, each of the G<br>
groups consists of S sub-carriers, so that the following equation is satisfied:<br>
N = SxG<br>
In addition, each of the G groups is divided into two sub-groups. The<br>
sub-groups include Sl sub-carriers and Sk sub-carriers, respectively.<br>
First, a first sub-channel is created by selecting one sub-carrier from each<br>
of the G sub-groups. A second sub-channel is created by selecting one sub-<br>
carrier from each of the G sub-groups except for the sub-carrier that is already<br>
allocated to the first sub-channel. The above procedure may be repeated until all<br>
sub-carriers of the G sub-groups are allocated to the sub-channels. As a result, a<br>
set of Sl sub-channels is created. In addition, as mentioned above, it is also<br>
possible to create a new set An of C sub-channels having sub-carriers different<br>
from the above sub-carriers by varying the sub-carrier selection scheme. The<br>
sub-channels of the new set An are orthogonal to each other in the same sub-<br>
channel set while representing the uniform collision characteristics with respect to<br>
sub-channels in the other sub-channel set. The sub-channel set An is allocated to<br>
each cell/sector so that the cell/sector can be managed with a frequency reuse<br>
factor of 1.<br>
Next, a first sub-channel is created by selecting one sub-carrier from each<br><br>
of the G sub-groups including Sk sub-carriers. A third sub-channel is created by<br>
selecting one sub-carrier from each of the G sub-groups except for the sub-carrier<br>
already allocated to the first sub-channel. The above procedure may be repeated<br>
until all sub-carriers of the G sub-groups are allocated to the sub-channels. As a<br>
result, a set of Sk sub-channels is created. The sub-channels are divided into K<br>
exclusive sub-channel groups and allocated to each of K cells/sectors, so that the<br>
cells/sectors can be managed with a frequency reuse factor K. In particular, since<br>
the sub-channels employing the frequency reuse factor 1 and sub-channels<br>
employing the frequency factor K include mutually different sub-carriers,<br>
interference may be prevented even if the frequency reuse factors of 1 and K are<br>
simultaneously employed.<br>
However, there is no apparatus or method for controlling transmission<br>
power in the IEEE 802.16e communication system employing multiple frequency<br>
reuse factors.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following detailed description,<br>
a detailed description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein<br>
will be omitted when it may make the subject matter of the present invention<br>
unclear.<br>
The present invention provides a cellular communication system. More<br>
particularly, the present invention provides an apparatus and a method for<br>
controlling transmission power in an Institute of Electrical and Electronics<br>
Engineers (IEEE) 802.16e communication system, which is a cellular<br>
communication system using an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access<br>
(OFDMA) scheme using a multiple frequency reuse factors. Although the<br>
present invention will be described in relation to the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system for illustrative purpose, the apparatus and the method of<br>
the present invention may be applicable to other cellular communication systems<br>
with multiple frequency reuse factors.<br>
Hereinafter, structure of a transmitter for an IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention will<br>
be described with reference to FIG. 7, which is a schematic view illustrating the<br>
structure of such a transmitter.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 7, the transmitter includes a cyclic redundancy check<br>
(CRC) inserter 711, an encoder 713, a symbol mapper 715, a sub-channel<br>
allocator 717, a serial to parallel converter 719, a pilot symbol inserter 721, a<br>
transmission power allocator 722, an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) unit<br>
723, a parallel to serial converter 725, a guard interval inserter 727, a digital to<br>
analog converter 729, and a radio frequency (RF) processor 731.<br>
When user data bits and control data bits are generated, the user data bits<br>
and control data bits are input to the CRC inserter 711. The user data bits and<br>
control data bits are referred to herein as "information data bits". The CRC<br>
inserter 711 inserts a CRC bit into the information data bits and outputs the<br>
information data bits to the encoder 713. Upon receiving the signal from the<br>
CRC inserter 711, the encoder 713 codes the signal through a predetermined<br>
coding scheme and outputs the coded signal to the symbol mapper 715. In this<br>
example, the predetermined coding scheme includes a turbo coding scheme<br>
having a predetermined coding rate or a convolutional coding scheme.<br>
The symbol mapper 715 modulates the coded bits output from the<br>
encoder 713 through a predetermined modulation scheme, forming a modulation<br>
symbol. The modulation symbol is output to the sub-channel allocator 717. In<br>
this example, the predetermined modulation scheme includes a quadrature phase<br>
shift keying (QPSK) scheme or a sixteen (16) quadrature amplitude modulation<br>
(QAM) scheme. Upon receiving the modulation symbols from the symbol<br>
mapper 715, the sub-channel allocator 717 allocates the sub-channels to the<br>
modulation symbols and outputs the modulation symbols to the serial to parallel<br>
converter 719. As mentioned above, the sub-channel allocator 717 allocates the<br>
sub-channels by applying mutually different frequency reuse factors. That is,<br>
the allocator 717 allocates the sub-channels to the modulation symbols by<br>
applying frequency reuse factors of 1 and K.<br>
Upon receiving the serial modulation symbols with the sub-channels from<br>
the sub-channel allocator 717, the serial to parallel converter 719 parallel-<br>
converts the modulation symbols and outputs the modulation symbols to the pilot<br>
symbol inserter 721. The pilot symbol inserter 721 inserts pilot symbols into the<br>
parallel modulation symbols and outputs the parallel modulation symbols to the<br>
transmission power allocator 722.<br>
The transmission power allocator 722 allocates transmission power to the<br><br>
sub-channels according to frequency reuse factors thereof and outputs the sub-<br>
channels to the IFFT unit 723. That is, the transmission power allocator 722<br>
allocates transmission power to a sub-carrier signal having a pilot symbol<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as a pilot sub-carrier signal) and a sub-carrier signal<br>
having data (hereinafter, referred to as a data sub-carrier signal) and transmits the<br>
pilot sub-carrier signal and the data sub-carrier signal to the IFFT unit 723.<br>
Transmission power allocation of the transmission power allocator 722 will be<br>
described later in detail.<br>
The IFFT unit 723 performs an N-point IFFT on the signals from the<br>
transmission power allocator 722, and sends the signals to the parallel to serial<br>
converter 725. The parallel to serial converter 725 converts the parallel signals<br>
into serial signals and outputs the serial signals to the guard interval inserter 727.<br>
The guard interval inserter 727 inserts a guard interval signal into the serial<br>
signals and outputs the serial signals to the digital to analog converter 729.<br>
Herein, the guard interval is used for removing interference between previous<br>
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing(OFDM) symbols and current<br>
OFDM symbols when the OFDM symbols are transmitted in the OFDMA<br>
communication system. In addition, the guard interval can be inserted into the<br>
OFDM symbol through a cyclic prefix scheme, in which predetermined final<br>
samples of the OFDM symbols in a time domain are copied and the copied<br>
samples are inserted into effective OFDM symbols, or through a cyclic postfix<br>
scheme, in which predetermined fore-samples of the OFDM symbols in the time<br>
domain are copied and the copied samples are inserted into effective OFDM<br>
symbols.<br>
After receiving the signal from the guard interval inserter 727, the digital<br>
to analog converter 729 converts the signal into an analog signal and outputs the<br>
analog signal to the RF processor 731. The RF processor 731 includes a filter<br>
and a front end unit and transmits the analog signal to a transmission antenna<br>
after RF-processing the analog signal for transmission.<br>
Hereinafter, an internal structure of the transmission power allocator 722<br>
as shown in FIG. 7 when frequency reuse factors of 1 and K are used will be<br>
described with reference to FIG. 8.<br>
FIG. 8 is a schematic view illustrating the internal structure of the<br>
transmission power allocator 722 as shown in FIG. 7 when frequency reuse<br><br>
factors of 1 and K are used.<br>
In FIG. 8, it is assumed that the IEEE 802.16e communication system<br>
uses N sub-carriers with frequency reuse factors of 1 and K.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, the transmission power allocator 722 includes a sub-carrier<br>
divider 811 and a plurality of multipliers 813-0 to 813-N'-1. The signal output<br>
from the pilot symbol inserter 721 is input to the sub-carrier divider 811, so that<br>
the sub-carrier divider 811 divides the signal into two sub-carrier groups<br>
according to the frequency reuse factors. That is, the sub-carrier divider 811<br>
divides the signal into a first group including sub-carriers with a frequency reuse<br>
factor of 1 and a second group including sub-carriers with a frequency reuse<br>
factor of K. The number of sub-carriers included in the first group is Rl and the<br>
number of sub-carriers included in the second group is RK. When the frequency<br>
reuse factor is K, each cell/sector may use 1/K sub-carriers from among resources<br>
having the frequency reuse factor K, so that Rl, RK and N satisfy Equation (1):<br><br>
As mentioned above, since 1/K sub-carriers are used when the frequency reuse<br>
factor is K, Rl and RK satisfy Equation (2):<br><br>
A sub-carrier signal of two sub-carrier groups is defined as Xn, in which n<br>
represents a number of sub-carrier signal. If the frequency reuse factor is 1, n of<br>
the sub-carrier signal Xn is in a range of about 0~R1-1. If the frequency reuse<br>
factor is K, n of the sub-carrier signal Xn is in a range of about R1~(N'-1).<br>
In addition, the signal outputted from the transmission power allocator 722 is<br>
obtained by multiplying the sub-carrier signal Xn of the sub-carrier divider 811 by<br>
a predetermined weight Wn. Herein, the signal obtained by multiplying the sub-<br>
carrier signal Xnby the predetermined weight Wn is defined as Yn.<br><br><br>
In Equation (3), a subscript n of Wn and Yn has a value identical to a value<br>
of a subscript n of Xn.<br>
Although it is not illustrated in FIG. 8, the multipliers 813-0 to 813-N'-1<br>
are connected to a controller. The controller determines the weight applied to<br>
the sub-channel signals and sends the weight to each of the multipliers 813-0 to<br>
813-N'-1. In effect, the multipliers 813-0 to 813-N'-1 adjust transmission power<br>
of the sub-carrier signals output from the sub-carrier divider 811 by applying the<br>
weight to the sub-carrier signals.<br>
In addition, the weight used for the sub-carrier signal with the frequency reuse<br>
factor 1 and the weight Wn used for the sub-carrier signal with the frequency<br>
reuse factor K may satisfy Equation (4):<br><br>
In Equation (4), P is a total transmission power of the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system, and Rp is an average power ratio of sub-carriers having<br>
frequency reuse factors of K and 1. When Rp is greater than 1, a part of<br>
transmission power to be allocated to the sub-carriers with the frequency reuse<br>
factor of 1 is additionally allocated to the sub-carriers with the frequency reuse<br>
factor of K.<br>
Herein, mutually different weights are applied to the sub-carriers as<br>
shown in FIG. 8 for the purpose of transmission power application based on the<br>
frequency reuse factors of 1 and K, boosting of pilot sub-carriers, and<br>
transmission power application per each sub-carrier according to an Adaptive<br>
Modulation and Coding (AMC) scheme.<br>
Hereinafter, an internal structure of the transmission power allocator 722<br>
as shown in FIG. 7 when frequency reuse factors of 1 and 3 are used will be<br>
described with reference to FIG. 9 which is a schematic view illustrating such a<br><br>
structure.<br>
In FIG. 9, it is assumed that the IEEE 802.16e communication system<br>
uses N sub-carriers with frequency reuse factors of 1 and 3. Although it will be<br>
described that the IEEE 802.16e communication system employs the frequency<br>
reuse factors of 1 and 3 for illustrative purpose, other frequency reuse factors are<br>
also applicable for the IEEE 802.16e communication system. Similar to the<br>
transmission power allocator 722 shown in FIG. 8, the transmission power<br>
allocator 722 shown in FIG. 9 includes a sub-carrier divider 811 and a plurality of<br>
multipliers 813-0 to 813-N'-1. However, the transmission power allocator 722<br>
shown in FIG. 9 employs frequency reuse factors 1 and 3.<br>
In particular, the transmission power allocator 722 shown in FIG. 9 allocates the<br>
transmission power corresponding to the frequency reuse factors to improve the<br>
Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) of a sub-carrier signal with a<br>
frequency reuse factor 3 by S[dB]. The same weight is applied to the sub-<br>
carriers employing the same frequency reuse factor. That is, a weight W1 is<br>
applied to the sub-carriers with the frequency reuse factor 1, and a weight W3 is<br>
applied to the sub-carriers with the frequency reuse factor 3 as shown in Equation<br>
(5):<br><br>
Since it is assumed that interference is rarely applied to the sub-carrier with the<br>
frequency reuse factor 3, the SINR of the sub-carrier with the frequency reuse<br>
factor 3 can be represented by Equation (6):<br><br>
In Equation (6), the SINR3n is an SINR of an nth sub-carrier signal Xn<br>
with the frequency reuse factor 3, PL°n is a signal attenuation component (that is,<br>
a pass loss) between a transmitter and a receiver of a cell (that is, a serving BS),<br>
to which the nth sub-carrier signal Xn is allocated in the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system, X2n is an average power of the nth sub-carrier signal Xn<br>
and µ is an average power of noise components. As can be seen from Equation<br><br>
6, when the frequency reuse factor 3 is employed, interference components from<br>
an adjacent BS do not exert an influence upon the SINR3n of the nth sub-carrier<br>
signal Xn.<br>
When a present weight W3 is 1 (W3 =1), a relationship between the weight W3<br>
(W3 =1) and a weight W1 capable of improving the SINR3n by S[dB] (S≥0) is<br>
shown in Equation (7):<br><br>
As can be seen from Equation (7), the SINR of the sub-carrier signal with the<br>
frequency reuse factor 3, that is, the SINR3n, is improved by S[dB]. In addition,<br>
the SINR of the sub-carrier signal with the frequency reuse factor 1, that is, the<br>
SINRln, is not degraded, or, the SINRln is degraded less than the improved S[dB].<br>
Herein, the SINRln is an SINR of the nth sub-carrier signal Xn with the frequency<br>
reuse factor 1.<br><br>
In Equation (8), PLin is a signal attenuation component (that is, a pass loss)<br>
between a transmitter and a receiver of an ith neighbor BS of a cell, to which the<br>
nth sub-carrier signal Xn is allocated in the IEEE 802.16e communication system,<br>
and X'n2 is an average power of the sub-carrier signal Xn of the ith neighbor BS.<br>
As can be seen from Equation (8), when the frequency reuse factor 1 is employed,<br>
all sub-carrier resources are simultaneously used in all BSs, so the noise<br>
component is significantly smaller than the interference component, making it<br>
possible to disregard the noise component. When the noise component is<br>
disregarded, the SINRln is represented by Equation (9):<br><br><br>
As shown in Equation (9), the SINRlnis not influenced by variation of<br>
the weight W. In addition, intensity and interference/noise components of the<br>
signal may be lowered due to the weight Wi even when the noise components are<br>
relatively large, so reduction of the SINRlnis less than the improvement S[dB] of<br>
the SINR3n. In particular, where R1&gt;R3, that is, when the number of the sub-<br>
carriers with the frequency reuse factor 3 is smaller than the number of the sub-<br>
carriers with the frequency reuse factor 1, the reduction of SINRln is further<br>
decreased.<br>
Hereinafter, a procedure of allocating the transmission power according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to FIG.<br>
10 which is a flowchart illustrating the procedure.<br>
In FIG. 10, it is assumed that the IEEE 802.16e communication system<br>
employs the frequency reuse factors of 1 and K. In step 1011, the transmitter of<br>
the OFDAM communication system decides an amount of SINRK,, improvement<br>
in relation to the sub-carrier signal Xnwith the frequency reuse factor K. Herein,<br>
the amount of SINRKn improvement is defined as S[dB]. In step 1013, the<br>
transmitter decides the weight Wn for each sub-carrier in such a manner that the<br>
weight Wn satisfies the S[dB] of the SINRKn. Since the procedure of deciding<br>
the weight Wn has already been described above, it will not be further described<br>
below. In step 1015, the transmitter applies the weight Wn to the sub-carriers and<br>
transmits the sub-carriers to the receiver.<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, the OFDMA<br>
communication system employs multiple frequency reuse factors to control<br>
transmission power allocation corresponding to the frequency reuse factors,<br>
thereby controlling the SINR according to the frequency reuse factors. That is,<br>
the weight applied to the sub-carriers with a higher frequency reuse factor is<br>
increased, thereby improving the SINR and transmission efficiency of the system.<br>
While the present invention has been shown and described with reference<br>
to certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in<br>
the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
TITEL : "APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING<br>
TRANSMISSION POWER IN COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS"<br><br>
The invention relates to a method to control transmission power in a<br>
communication system, the method comprising the steps of applying a first<br>
weight to sub-carrier signals employing a first frequency reuse factor, thereby<br>
controlling the transmission power; and_applying a second weight to sub-carrier<br>
signals employing a second frequency reuse factor, thereby controlling the<br>
transmission power, wherein the first weight and the second weight are<br>
determined corresponding to an improvement value of a Signal to Interference<br>
and Noise Ratio (SINR) of the sub-carrier signals employing the first frequency<br>
reuse factor to increase the SINR of the sub-carrier signals employing the first<br>
frequency reuse factor obtained in a previous time duration, and_wherein the<br>
first weight and the second weight are determined using the improvement value<br>
of the SINR, a total transmission power of the communication system, a number<br>
of the sub-carriers employing the first frequency reuse factor in the<br>
communication system, and a number of the sub-carriers employing the second<br>
frequency reuse factor in the communication system.</td>
