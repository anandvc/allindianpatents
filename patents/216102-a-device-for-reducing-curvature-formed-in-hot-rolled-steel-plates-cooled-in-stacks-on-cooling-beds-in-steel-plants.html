				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a device for reducing curvature  formed in hot-rolled steel plates cooled in stacks on cooling beds in steel plants.<br>
The invention relates more particularly to a cover made of mild steel plates supported with mild steel angles and beams at intervals,  the internal  surface of the  cover being lined with heat insulating materials and the cover being of dimensions suitable for enclosing the hot steel plates of relatively large dimentions stacked on air cooling beds located neap the roughing stands in steel plants.<br>
In the existing practice the hot steel plates at a temperature  of 900-950°C are stacked on the  cooling beds and are allowed to cool in natural air.     In view of the  relatively large  dimensions and heavy weight i.e.  6-8 tonne  of each plate, only 4-5 plates are  normally piled in each stack so that the stack is not too heavy to be handled by means of a finger type lift of weight carrying capacity upto 45 tonne.<br>
The stacks placed on the cooling beds being exposed to natural air during their cooling,  the plates lying at the top of the stacks cool at a faster rate while those lying below the top plate cool at a slower rate.     For example,   the temperature of the plates lying at the  top  of the  stacks may be lowered within half an hour of cooling from an initial 900-950°C to 650-700°C and that of the plates lying  below the  top plate drops only marginally during the same period of cooling. Because  of the  non-uniform  rates of cooling of the plates in a stack in the existing method of cooling,   the  flat surface of<br>
the plates lying at the tops of the stacks cumbers readily to take a wavy form of varying amplitude and wavelength leading to their down-grading/rejection or re-flattening by means of capital intensive hydraulic press of adequately large dimensions and pressing  capacity.<br>
Moreover the mechanical properties of the plates cooled in the existing method may deteriorate and their hydrogen content may increase because of their cooling at a non-uniform rate.<br>
The object of the present invention is  to provide a device  in the  form of a cover having an internal lining of heat insulating material of appropriate  thickness for enclosing the stacks of hot steel plates during their cooling on the cooling beds and thereby controlling the cooling rate of all the plates in the stacks to be more or less uniform and thus preventing the formation of excessive curvature of the  flat surface of the plates lying at the top of the  stacks.<br>
Another object is to provide a device for retaining the mechanical properties of the cooled hot plates unaffected during cooling.<br>
Yet another object is to provide a device for improving  the ultrasonic soundness of the cooled plates by reducing the hydrogen content thereof.<br>
The invention is  described fully and particularly with reference to the accompanying drawings  in which -<br>
Figure 1 is a view of the horizontal section of the device; and<br>
Figure 2 is a sectional end view of the device.<br>
The  device is made in the form of a cover of rectangular cross section and preferred dimensions 12.5 m in length,  4.0 m in width and 1.0 m in depth,   to make the  same suitable for enclosing stacks of steel plates of various dimensions produced in the steel plants.     The  device is made of mild steel sheet (1)  of preferred thickness  6.0 mm, supported on tv/o pairs of beams (4,   5)   disposed along the length,   the  separation between the beams of each pair being 1.0    m,   and on thirteen beams  (8)  disposed along  the v/idth of horizontal  top surface  thereof and on horizontally and vertically disposed beams  (not shown)  on the four vertical sides thereof,   the beams being of height 150/200 mm and width 75/100 mm.     The areas of the mild steel  sheet lying between the adjacent pairs of horizontally and transversely disposed beams on the top horizontal surface and horizontally and vertically disposed beams on the  four vertical sides of the device are each further supported by means of a diagonally disposed mild steel angle   (not shown)  of typical dimensions 75 x 75 x 10 mm.    The internal surface of the device is provided with a lining (2)  of heat insulation materials like ceramic fibre wool,   formed typically in three layers, each 25.0 mm thick,  being held in position by means of wire mesh (3) and fittings  (not shown) of stainless steel of AISI 304 grade. The accessories (7)  fitted on the outside horizontal surface of the device for lifting the device by means of finger type crane,   comprise typically eighteen mild steel plates each of dimentions 700 x 425 x 25 mm,  disposed in two rows of nine each<br>
at the crossings of each pair of longitudinally disposed beams (4,  5) and intermediate nine  of the thirteen transversely disposed beams (8), excluding two beams (8) adjacent each side of the device.    The upper ends of each row of accessories  (7) are supported on beams (6)  disposed along the length of the device.<br>
Filed trials have  been conducted using the invented device for determining the time required for cooling of the steel plates of different thickness and for optimising the thickness of the heat insulating materials used in lining  (2) to maintain the cooling time of a stack of steel plates to  be in the range of 6 to 10 hours for achieving the desired production rate in a steel plant.<br>
Stacks containing 4-5 steel plates of different thickness,   width and length have been cooled from an initial temperature of 637-853°C to a finishing  temperature 278-377°C. The cooling time required for each stack has been noted.<br>
The  curvature produced in the cooled plates has been measured in terms of the amplitude  in mm and number of waves formed in the  cooled plates in a length of 4.0 m thereof and compared against the  acceptable values specified in international standards.     The test results are presented in Table I.<br>
The mechanical properties of the plates cooled with and without using the  device have been determined for comparison. The  test results are given in Table II.<br>
The hydrogen content of the plates cooled v/ith and without using the device has  been assessed analytically.    It<br>
has been found to be 4-5 ppm in plates cooled using the device  and 6-7 ppm in plates cooled without using the  device. From the test results obtained the  following observations are made  :-<br>
(a)	The curvature in plates cooled using the device  is<br>
well within the acceptable limits according to International<br>
standards.<br>
(b)	The mechanical properties of the plates cooled using<br>
the device are more or less similar to those of the plates<br>
cooled without using the  device.<br>
(c)	The time for cooling the plates using  the device is<br>
within the  allowable  range  of 6 to  10 hours.<br>
(d)	The hydrogen content of the plates cooled using the<br>
device is appreciably lower (4-5 ppm)  in comparison v/ith the<br>
plates cooled without using the  device  (6-7 ppm),   with expected<br>
better ultrasonic soundness of the former.<br>
