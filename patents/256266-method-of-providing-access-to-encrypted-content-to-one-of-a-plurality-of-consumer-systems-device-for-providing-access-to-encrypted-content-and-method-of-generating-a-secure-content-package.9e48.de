Method of providing access to encrypted content to one of a plurality of consumer systems, device for providing access to encrypted content and method of generating a secure content package<br>
The invention relates to a method of providing access to encrypted content to one of a plurality of consumer systems, each consumer system being able to obtain a secure content package, including the encrypted content and an indication of a location from which to request a rights data object, and further including at least one device having access to a thus obtained secure content package and provided with an agent function enabling it to retrieve a rights data object from a device issuing rights data objects from the indicated location and for providing access to at least part of the encrypted content, the rights data object including at least content key information enabling decryption of at least part of the encrypted content and being cryptographically bound to at least the device to which it is issued, such that only devices with an agent function to which the rights data object has been bound are able to obtain the content key information.<br>

which data processing device includes a protected environment.<br>
The invention also relates to a computer program<br>

The invention also relates to a further computer<br>
program.<br>
Respective examples of such methods, a data processing device and computer program are known from "OMA DRM Architecture, Draft Version 2.0", Open Mobile Alliance Ltd., March 15, 2004. This document describes mechanisms for secure authentication of trusted DRM (Digital Rights Management) agents and for secure packaging and transfer of usage rights and DRM Content to trusted DRM agent. Content is packaged in a secure content container (DCF). DRM Content is encrypted with a symmetric content encryption key (CEK). A DRM agent embodies a trusted environment within which DRM Content can be securely consumed. Its role is to enforce permissions and constraints and to control access to DRM Content. All DRM Agents have a unique private/public key pair and a certificate. A Rights Object is a document expressing the permissions and constraints associated <br>
with the content. The Rights Object also contains the CEK. Before delivering the Rights Object, sensitive parts are encrypted and the Rights Object is then cryptographically bound to the target DRM Agent. The Rights Object and DCF can then be 5 delivered using any transport mechanism (e.g. HTTP/WSP, WAP<br>
Push, MMS). One model for content distribution is using an Over- The-Air download mechanism. The client initiates a browsing session with the Content Portal. The client downloads the DRM Content from the portal to local storage. The client looks up a 0 Rights Issuer URL (Universal Resource Locator) within the DRM Content headers and initiates a connection to the Rights Issuer portal. It engages in the Rights Object Acquisition Protocol. The client, at the successful completion of this protocol acquires the Rights Object associated with the DRM Content. 5	A problem of the known scheme is that it does not scale<br>
well to allow access rights to be provided to larger numbers of clients within a relatively small time interval. Each will look up the Rights Issuer URL and attempt to access the same Rights Issuer portal over the network at the same time, leading to 0 congestion avoidable only by using a network and portal with a large capacity.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide methods, a data processing device and computer program of the types mentioned above, to implement a Digital Rights Management 5 infrastructure that scales relatively well with increasing numbers of consumer systems.<br>
This object is achieved by means of the method of providing access to encrypted content to one of a plurality of consumer systems according to the invention, which is 0 characterised by transferring a rights issuer module to a<br>
protected environment of a device for incorporation in the one consumer system, enabling the device, when operational in the consumer system, to generate at least one rights data object cryptographically bound to a requesting one of the devices in 5 the consumer system provided with an agent function.<br>
The term cryptographically bound is used herein to indicate that the rights data object has been subjected to a cryptographic operation making it accessible only to the devices to which it has been bound. A protected environment is an <br>
environment that has been made resistant to tampering by- hardware or software measures, or a combination of the two.<br>
Because the rights issuer module is transferred to a protected environment of a device for incorporation in the one 5 consumer system, the devices with an agent function in that system can obtain rights data objects through a path in the consumer system that is independent of any links accessible to the other consumer systems. Thus, less use is made of the bandwidth provided by such links. The invention has the 0 advantage that it becomes feasible to split content into many smaller sections, each requiring a different content key, because the requests to the rights issuer module are not transmitted over a public network. It has the further advantage that detailed knowledge of the configuration of each of the 5 consumer systems need not be maintained centrally. Secret<br>
information for cryptographically binding rights data objects to requesting devices with an agent function is kept locally.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, wherein the one consumer system includes an interface to an external communication 0 network and wherein the consumer system is arranged to transfer data received through the interface to the device with the protected environment, the rights issuer module is transferred via the communication network.<br>
The effect is to be able to update devices in consumer 5 systems that have already been issued with newly developed rights issuer modules. This can be used to provide access to content data from another provider, to remedy or prevent the possibility of reverse analysis of rights issuer modules, etc.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the rights issuer module is D transferred to a portable secure data processing device having an interface to a device in the consumer system.<br>
The effect of this is that the rights issuer module is issued to a particular user, rather than a particular consumer system. This allows the user to access the encrypted content 5 using another consumer system, by transferring the portable<br>
secure data processing device to another consumer system with a device adapted to exchange data through the interface of the portable secure data processing device. It also allows for changes to the configuration of the one consumer system.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the rights issuer module is transferred to a portable secure device having an interface to a cellular telephone handset, preferably a Subscriber Identity Module Card.<br>
This embodiment has the advantage that efficient use is made of a ubiquitous infrastructure with all the components necessary to implement decentralised issuing of rights data objects. As information relating to the telephone subscription must be kept in a secure environment, cellular telephones generally already comprise a protected environment, to which the rights issuer module can be transferred. Furthermore, the telephone handset is frequently used to download and render content data, as well as to communicate it to further devices in the consumer system. The invention finds advantageous application in providing limited access to, for example, ring tones, screen images, games, etc.<br>
A preferred embodiment includes transferring further respective rights issuer modules to protected environments of further devices for incorporation in respective further consumer systems, each rights issuer module enabling the device to which it is transferred, when operational in one of the further consumer systems, to generate at least one rights data object cryptographically bound to a requesting one of the devices in the consumer system provided with an agent function.<br>
This embodiment allows content data to be played out to large numbers of consumer systems without having to use a large amount of bandwidth to provide them with rights data objects. It further allows a finer differentiation between consumer systems in respect of the types of access rights each is granted.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, wherein each device with an agent function is configured, when performing the agent function, to provide access to the encrypted content only in accordance with access rights included in the rights data object, the method includes transferring a rights issuer module enabling the device with the protected environment, when operational in the consumer system, to generate at least one rights data object, cryptographically bound to a requesting one of the devices in the consumer system provided with an agent function and including at least one access right.<br>
A preferred variant includes receiving a set of access conditions applicable to the one consumer system and configuring the rights issuer module in such a manner that a combination of access rights included in a set of one or more rights data objects issued to requesting devices in the one consumer system provided with an agent function complies with the set of access conditions applicable to the one consumer system.<br>
The step of configuring the rights issuer module is carried out either before or after the rights issuer module is transferred. The effect of this embodiment is that access rights may be defined centrally for the complete consumer system, rather than for each device with an agent function in the consumer system. Thus, account is taken of the fact that a user may have a consumer system with several devices with an agent function. The choice of which device to use to access the content data is left to the user.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, the data processing device according to the invention is characterised in that<br>
the data processing device further includes a rights issuer module, configured to run in the protected environment, and enabling the data processing device, when incorporated and operational in the consumer system, to generate at least one rights data object cryptographically bound to a requesting one of the devices in the consumer system provided with an agent function.<br>
The data processing device makes a source of rights data objects accessible independently of any network shared with other consumer systems. Thus, bandwidth constraints on such networks are avoided.<br>
According to another aspect, the invention provides a computer program arranged, when loaded into a data processing device including a protected environment, to enable the data processing device to function as a data processing device according to the invention.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, the method of providing a secure content data package, including encrypted content data, for use by one of a plurality of consumer systems, is characterised by providing resource indicator data pointing to a location within the one consumer system.<br>
This method has the advantage of limiting use of the interface by pointing to a location within the one consumer system to which requests for rights data objects may be directed.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, the server according to the invention is characterised in that the server is configured to provide with the encrypted content data resource indicator data pointing to a location within the one consumer system.<br>
The server has the advantage that it is configured to make economical use of the communications network.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, the signal according to the invention is characterised in that the secure content data package further includes resource indicator data representative of a data path to a location within the consumer system.<br>
According to another aspect, the invention provides a computer program arranged, when loaded into a data processing device, to enable the data processing device to execute a method of providing a secure content data package according to the invention.<br>
The invention will now be explained in further detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 shows in schematic form a system for providing secure content packages and rights data objects providing access to these to a plurality of consumer systems;<br>
Fig. 2 shows in schematic form a first type of secure content package including encrypted content data;<br>
Fig. 3 shows in schematic form a second type of secure content package including encrypted content data; and<br>
Fig. 4 gives a schematic overview of a cellular telephone handset in one or more of the consumer systems.<br>
In Fig. 1, encrypted content is provided to consumer systems via a cellular network 1. The cellular network may be a CDMA, GSM, GPRS or UMTS network, for example. Accordingly, a first consumer system is formed by a first cellular phone 2 and<br>
a second consumer system by a second cellular phone 3. A third consumer system is formed by a combination of a third cellular phone 4, a home network 5 and a personal computer 6.<br>
As an alternative to providing the encrypted content to the third consumer system via the cellular network 1, it could be provided in a broadcast, multicast or unicast mode via a cable or satellite network (not shown) to the personal computer 5, or on a data carrier, such as a CD or DVD. The fact that the consumer systems are defined as being able to obtain the encrypted content does not preclude a scheme wherein the encrypted content is pre-loaded into one or more of the first, second and third cellular phones 2-4, but not yet accessible.<br>
Examples of content include ring tones, screen savers or background themes, and games for use on the cellular phones 2-4. Depending on the type of cellular network 1, the content may include compressed audio or video files. MP3-files are examples of the former category; MPEG-2, H.2 64/AVC are standards defining examples of the latter category.<br>
Secure content packages including at least one section of encrypted content are provided from a first content server 7, accessible via a gateway 8 connecting the cellular network 1 to (at least part of) the Internet 9. Alternatively, content such as ring tones may be downloaded from a second content server 10 directly via the cellular network 1.<br>
In the following, an implementation will be detailed in which the secure content packages available to the consumer systems comply substantially with Open Mobile Alliance specifications, in particular version 2 of the Digital Rights Management (DRM) specifications belonging thereto. An alternative standard for implementing Digital Rights Management could be used.<br>
"OMA DRM Content Format V2.0, Draft Version 2.0", Open Mobile Alliance Ltd., April 20, 2004, defines two file structures that are preferably used. Reference is made to that publication for precise details.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the format of a Discrete Media Profile (DCF) file 11. It includes a file header 12, which identifies the type and version of the file 11. The file header 12 is followed by a first data structure, referred to as a first DRM <br>
container 13. In this example, it includes a second DRM container 14. The first DRM container 13 includes a common headers box 15 and a content object container 16. The content object container 16 includes a first section of encrypted content data. A similar structure in the second DRM container 14 carries a second section of encrypted content data, preceded by a second common headers box (not shown). Thus, the first DRM container 13 links the common headers box 15 to the content object container 136<br>
The common headers box 15 includes at least a field containing a globally unique identifier. The value is unique to the encrypted section of content data included in the content object container 16. It will be referred to herein as the event_ID.<br>
The common headers box 15 further includes a Universal Resource Locator (URL), which indicates a location from which a rights data object may be requested that includes content key information for decrypting at least part of the encrypted section of content data in the content object container 13. Thus, as part of a method of providing a secure content data package including encrypted content data, for use by one of a plurality of consumer systems, resource indicator data is provided with the encrypted content data. The resource data provided is indicative of a location from which a device functioning as the rights issuer is issuing rights data objects. Consequently, the first and second content servers 7,10 are configured to provide to the one consumer system resource indicator data with the encrypted content data.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the format of a Continuous Packetised Media Profile (PDCF) file 17, which is targeted for media content like audio and video. It is a file structure intended to facilitate the streaming of the secure content package to one of the cellular phones 2-4. The PDCF file 17 starts with a file header 18, which identifies the type and version of the PDCF file 17. The PDCF file 17 further includes a movie box 19, which includes a first track box 2 0 and at least one further track box 21. The first track box 20 includes a protection scheme box 22. In the example, a section of a first track of content data is encrypted and included as packets in a media data <br>
box 23. Packets belonging to a section of at least one further track of content data are included in the clear in the same media data box 23. A header in each packet identifies the track to which the packet belongs, and links the packet to one of the first and further track boxes 20,21. At least one common headers box (not shown) is included in the movie box 19. There is either one applicable to all tracks or one in the first track box 20, applicable only to the encrypted section of the first track of content. Thus, the PDCF file 17 is structured to have a header containing the event_ID unique to the encrypted section of content data.<br>
The section of encrypted content could be packaged in some other way, for example as a section of an MPEG-2 Packetised Elementary Stream, linked to a structure similar to the common headers box 15 via the elementary stream identifier, or the packet identifier of an MPEG-2 transport stream carrying the packetised elementary stream. In each case, the encrypted section of content data is provided with the event_ID unique to it.<br>
Fig. 4 is a schematic diagram showing some relevant components of the third cellular phone 4. The cellular phone forms a terminal including a handset and a portable secure data processing device in the shape of a Subsciber Identity Module (SIM) card 24. The SIM card includes an integrated circuit (IC) 25, embedded in the SIM card 24, and preferably packaged in a tamper-proof manner. Mechanisms for packaging the IC 25 in such a manner are known in the art. The IC 25 includes a processor 26, Electronically Erasable and Programmable Read- Only-Memory (EEPROM) 27, main memory 28, and part of an interface 2 9 to the handset, which interface further includes contact pads co-operating with contacts in the handset. Further security features for making the SIM card 24 secure include cryptographic and/or code obfuscation techniques, which are known per se. Thus, the IC 25 provides a protected environment for running applications critical to the security of the overall DRM scheme.<br>
The handset includes a handset controller 30, linked to an interface 31 to the SIM card 24, arranged to interact with the interface 2 9 of the latter to the handset. For voice <br>
telephony, the handset includes an audio input stage 32 and audio output stage 33, the former digitising the user's speech,	^<br>
the latter providing output to a loudspeaker. A modulator 34, demodulator 35 and first antenna 36 form an interface to the 5 cellular network 1. A wireless communications controller 37 and second antenna 3 8 form an interface to the home network 5. The handset further includes handset Random Access Memory (RAM) 3 9 and handset EEPROM 40, as well as a keypad 41 and display driver 42.<br>
D	Software code stored in handset EEPROM 4 0 provides it<br>
with an agent function, enabling it to access the encrypted content data using information in a rights data object. The handset further has a unique private/public key pair and a certificate enabling authentication of the handset. 5	In one embodiment, the handset obtains the secure<br>
content package from the first content server 7, for example as an MMS message. In another embodiment, the handset includes a browser for browsing the Internet 9, and obtains the secure content package from the second content server 10. In a further ) embodiment the secure content package is factory-installed on the EEPROM 27 of the SIM card 24 or handset EEPROM 40. The secure content package may also be obtained through the interface to the home network 5.<br>
When acting as agent, the handset retrieves the &gt; event_ID and URL received with the encrypted content data, upon being triggered to access the encrypted content data. It formulates a request message to a device with a rights issuer module installed. The URL is parsed to obtain the address to which to send the request. The request itself may also be in the ) form of a URL, as is known in the art. The request includes at least the event_ID linked to the section of encrypted content data to which access is desired.<br>
In response, and subject to criteria for granting access being fulfilled, the handset receives a rights data I object from the device with the installed rights issuer module. The rights data object includes a key for decrypting the section of encrypted content data uniquely associated with the event_ID.<br>
The rights data object preferably further includes data representative of access rights, in the form of a set of<br>
permissions and constraints. Permissions define the types of access permitted, such as copying, communicating to other devices, rendering, etc. Constraints qualify the permissions, for example by defining the number of times access of the defined type may be provided. Each device with agent functionality is regarded as a trusted entity. The program code providing the handset with agent functionality configures it to provide access to the encrypted content only in accordance with the access rights defined in the rights data object. This sets out the DRM scheme presented herein from a generic conditional access scheme, making it particularly suited for broadcasting content to a consumer system including a home network 5, as will be explained below. To ensure enforcement of the access rights, the program code providing the handset with agent functionality is preferably also tamper-proofed, using one or more of the techniques described above in connection with the IC 25 on the SIM card 24. Some or all of the agent functionality may be in the SIM card 24.<br>
The rights issuer module is configured such that issued rights data objects are cryptographically bound to at least the handset with the agent functionality. Preferably, at least the key information in the rights data object is encrypted under a public key forming a key pair with a private key of the handset. It is noted that the rights data object may be cryptographically bound to a plurality of devices with agent functionality forming a defined domain within one consumer system, so that the rights data object can be transferred to the personal computer 6 and used by the latter to provide access to the encrypted content data, provided the personal computer also includes an agent function and has the right certificate and/or cryptographic keys. Some or all of the agent functionality may be in a smart card co-operating with the computer.<br>
In a first embodiment, the rights issuer module has been transferred to the EEPROM 27 of the SIM card 24 prior to its incorporation into the third cellular phone 4. When operational, the rights issuer module, which is preferably a computer program module executable by the processor 26, enables the SIM card 24 to generate rights data objects<br>
cryptographically bound to the handset, or to any other device with agent functionality that is a node in the home network 5.<br>
In a second embodiment, the rights issuer module is transferred to the SIM card 24 subsequent to its installation in &gt; the third cellular phone 4. As an example, first DRM server 43 is arranged to transfer a rights issuer module for issuing rights data objects related to encrypted content provided from the first content source 7. A second DRM server 44 is arranged to transfer a rights issuer module for issuing rights data ) objects related to encrypted content provided from the second content source 10.<br>
A third embodiment is conceivable in the consumer system including the third cellular phone 4, in which the rights issuer module is pre-installed or transferred, to a smart card ; (not shown) for incorporation into the consumer system by<br>
insertion into a smart card reader (not shown) attached to the personal computer 6. A further alternative is to download the rights issuer module to a trusted platform module fixedly installed in either the handset or the personal computer 6.<br>
Preferably, further respective rights issuer modules are transferred to SIM cards in the first and second cellular phones 2,3. They each enable the respective SIM cards to generate rights data objects cryptographically bound to the handsets in which the SIM cards are incorporated. The effect is that no use need be made of the cellular network 1 to obtain rights data objects. The effect is most pronounced when the encrypted content data is broadcast, since the broadcast is relatively efficient in terms of bandwidth usage, and congestion due to myriads of cellular phones trying to obtain rights data objects at the same time is avoided.<br>
As mentioned, the rights issuer module is configured to issue rights data objects including at least one access right. Preferably, the entity providing the rights issuer modules receives a set of access conditions applicable to the or each consumer system. It configures the rights issuer module transferred to the SIM card 24 in the third cellular phone 4 in such a manner that a combination of access rights included in all rights data objects issued to the handset and the personal computer 6, and any other device with agent functionality<br>
attached to the home network 5, complies with the set of access conditions applicable to the one consumer system formed by these devices. Thus, for example, the encrypted content may have as access condition that each consumer system may make only five copies. The rights issuer module in the SIM card 24 is then configured to issue five rights data objects, each defining the right to copy once.<br>
In a first variant, the set of access conditions applicable to the consumer system are coded into the rights issuer module transferred to the SIM card 24. In another embodiment, the rights issuer module is configured by means of a separate communication over the cellular network 1 to a SIM card 24 with a previously installed rights issuer module, in effect re-configuring that rights issuer module.<br>
It is noted that the entity generating either the DCF file 11 or the PDCF file 17 provides therein a URL pointing to a location within the consumer system receiving the secure content data package. Also, the signal provided from the first and/or second content server 7,10 includes data resource indicator data pointing to a location within the one consumer system to which the content data is provided. The URL may be in a generic form, i.e. representative of a data path to a location within a consumer system, but not necessarily only meaningful in the context of one particular consumer system. That is to say that is may take the form of an instruction to a receiving handset to request a rights data object from any installed SIM card 24, not necessarily one with a particular serial number.<br>
The description will now focus in more detail on the preferred functionality of the rights issuer module and agent functionality, as well as going into a particular type of secure content package.<br>
Especially where the content data to be provided consists of a broadcast program or video to be provided on demand, it is desirable to separate the complete set of content data to be transferred into multiple sections, which will also be termed events in the present description. By encrypting each section separately, so that it can be decrypted only under its own content key, a key cycling scheme is implemented. A higher<br>
degree of protection is obtained by separating the complete set of content data into smaller separate events.<br>
Because the rights issuer module is arranged to issue rights data objects for events including at least part of the content decryption key, or event key, it must have access to the key information. To avoid having to transfer large amounts of key information from the first and second content servers 7,10 to the SIM card 24, the keys for events are a function of event information uniquely associated with the event and provided by the first or second content server 7,10.<br>
In a first variant, the event_ID is used to carry event information uniquely associated with the event and used as input to the cryptographic function that the rights issuer module executes to re-generate an event key.<br>
In a second variant, the agent functionality enables the handset to derive a certificate from the content data belonging to the event. Preferably, the certificate is in an encrypted form. The SIM card 24 receives the certificate, decrypts it, and obtains event information unique to the event. At least a part is used to generate key information enabling the handset to decrypt the event, possibly after further processing of the key information. In this embodiment, it is preferred that the certificate is encrypted under a public key of the SIM card 24. Thus, the content provider can tie access rights to a particular SIM card 24, and thus to a particular subscriber, rather than to a particular handset.<br>
The certificate may also be included in the event_ID, in the sense that a decryption operation must be carried out on at least part of the event_ID to obtain event information usable as input to the cryptographic operation that finally provides the event key information.<br>
To provide security to counter any analysis of the cryptographic function used to generate the event key information, the event key information is generated using a cryptographic function that combines at least a part of key information loaded by the rights issuer module with at least a part of the event information. Preferably, such group key information is uploaded to the SIM card 24 from one of the first and second content servers 7,10 or the first and second DRM<br>
servers 43,44. Alternatively, the SIM card 24 could be pre¬loaded with the group keys. One or more group keys may be part of the rights issuer modules transferred to the SIM card 24. It is noted that group keys need be refreshed less frequently due to the fact that both they and the event information unique to an event are used as input to the cryptographic function that provides the event key information for the event.<br>
A group key is preferably applicable to several events, for example all events, i.e. sections of content data into which a larger unit of content data, such as a movie, has been divided. A group key may also, or alternatively, be applicable to a set of one or more consumer systems, with the total population of consumer systems being partitioned into multiple sets several times. Upon determining that a particular one of the devices issuing rights data objects has been compromised, use of the group keys applicable to sets including that device is discontinued. Thus, a compromised SIM card 24 can be revoked.<br>
In one embodiment, a group key hierarchy may be implemented, wherein each group key at a highest level is associated with one of multiple sets of events and/or consumer systems and each group key at a lower level associated with one of multiples sub-sets of one of the sets. In such a scenario, group keys at different levels are preferably changed at different frequencies.<br>
The scheme presented herein allows for implementation of several payment models.<br>
In an embodiment, a rights issuer module configures the SIM card 24, to store data identifying the event with which the event information provided to it by the handset is uniquely associated in a log in the EEPROM 27. Preferably, but not necessarily, this data is stored with data representative of an entity associated with the device including the agent function, e.g its owner. Storage of event identification data allows collected license fees to be distributed fairly to the providers of the content data, in accordance with the amount of use made of content data provided by them.<br>
The SIM card 24 receives a message from a system associated with a provider of content data and returns at least one message representative of at least part of the data stored<br>
in the log. This is, of course, preferably done through the intermediary of the handset, in response to a query from one of the first and second content servers 7,10 or first and second DRM servers 43,44.<br>
The rights issuer module, when operative in the SIM card 24, loads and stores into EEPROM 27 data representative of a credit level accorded to an entity. The entity is, naturally, preferably the user of the SIM card 24, i.e. user of the consumer system including one of the cellular phones 2-4. The stored data is modified to reflect a lower credit level every time a rights data object is provided to a device with the agent function.<br>
In a first variant, the credit level is lowered by a standard amount with each issued rights data object. Thus, each request to issue a rights data object represents a single unit of credit stored in a purse in the SIM card 24.<br>
In a second variant, the agent function allows the device on which it is provided to derive a certificate from data provided with the encrypted content data forming the event. The rights issuer module in the SIM card 24 receives the certificate from the device providing the request for a rights data object. The certificate incorporates data reflecting the event cost. The content provider or entity associating limited access rights, or license conditions, to an event, generates the certificate, in accordance with the amount it wishes to charge for access to the event. The certificate may be included in similar fashion to the certificate providing event information used to generate the key for decrypting the event. Indeed, it may be the same certificate. The data representative of the unique event information, more particularly the event_ID itself, may allow extraction of such a certificate. Thus a particular value or set of values of event_ID provides an indication of the event cost.<br>
It has been noted that an advantage of the Digital Rights Management scheme is that the rights issuer module is capable of generating a rights data object including at least one access right, preferably in accordance with license conditions derivable from data provided with the encrypted content and forwarded by the handset to the SIM card 24. The SIM card 24 receives the derived data determining the license conditions from the device with the agent function providing the request for a rights data object. It selects the access rights to be included in the rights data object in accordance with the received derived data.<br>
Advantageously, the license conditions are also included in a certificate, such as the certificate reflecting the event cost. The license conditions themselves could comprise data reflecting the event cost. In that case, the SIM card 24 stores data linking each type of license condition to a certain event cost. Thus, the license condition allowing five copies would result in five deductions by an amount equal to the stored cost for copying. The certificate may carry a definition of available license types, each associated with a different cost. The SIM card 24, upon receiving the certificate, and optionally decrypting it, initiates an interaction with the user via the handset controller 30, keypad 41 and display driver 42 to select one of the available license types and to authorise appropriate decrementing of the credit level stored in the EEPROM 27.<br>
As described above in relation to event costs, data determining license conditions can be incorporated in the event_ID. A particular component, value or range of values of the event_ID determines the license conditions and/or payment model. For example, "play-back once" may be in a first range, "play-back unlimited" in a second range of values. Thus, the content provider communicates at least some of the license conditions to the server that is the SIM card 24 by means of the event_ID.<br>
It has been noted above that a key cycling scheme is especially desirable where the content data to be provided consists of a broadcast program or video to be provided on demand. To avoid interruptions in the decryption of consecutive sections of content data encrypted under different keys, and thus also identified by means of different event_IDs, it is preferred that decryption key information be available to the device with the agent functionality in advance of the event concerned. To this end, at least some of the encrypted sections of content data provided over the cellular network 1 are provided with two event_IDs: one identifying the event itself and one identifying a subsequently provided event.<br>
The second event_ID may be in a Textual Headers field of the Common Headers Box carrying the first event_ID in the DCF file 11 or PDCF file 17. Thus, the first and second event_ID are provided substantially simultaneously. This is the case because 5 the first and second content server 7,10 would create a serial data stream on the basis of such a file, when streaming content to one of the cellular phones 2-4. In such a data stream, the first event_ID is followed by the second event_ID before any event follows. In the DCF file 11, the first DRM Container 13 0 links the common headers box 15 to the content object<br>
container 16 carrying the first event. If the event with which the second event_ID is associated is carried in the second DRM Container 14, then the second event_ID is provided a second time in a common headers box 15 of the second DRM Container 14. 5	Similarly, where the PDCF file 17 forms the basis for<br>
streaming the content data to the cellular phones 2-4, access units or packets in the media data box 23 will be provided with a wrapper,i.e. encapsulated by data including a header and/or a trailer, that links them to a data structure with a field for 0 the first event_ID and one for the second event_ID, so that they are similarly provided substantially simultaneously. The second event_ID is provided a second time when encrypted data belonging to the event to which it is uniquely associated is provided.<br>
Software loaded into the handset provides it with the 5 ability to execute an adapted decryption method. The handset<br>
receives from the first or second content provider 7,10 a first event with both the first event_ID and the second event_ID. It provides a request for a rights data object with the second event_ID, prior to receiving the second section of content data. ) Thus, it may obtain in advance the event key information for at least one event subsequent to the first event. To minimise communication across the interfaces 2 9,31, the first and second event_ID are provided in a single request to the SIM card 24 with the rights issuer module. &gt;	The handset controller 30 receives two decryption keys<br>
in one or more rights data objects from the SIM card 24. The first of these is used to decrypt the first event, and optionally a limited number of events received subsequently to<br>
receiving the first event. The second decryption key is stored in main memory 28 or EEPROM 2 7 for subsequent use.<br>
As noted above, the second event_ID is received a second time. In response to receiving the second event_ID a second time, the handset retrieves the stored second content decryption key, and proceeds to decrypt at least the second event with that key.<br>
Thus, the event_ID is used to trigger a key change in a key cycling scheme. In general, it need not be the event_ID uniquely associated with the second event that triggers the key change. The handset may be configured to react to a different event_ID, or different type of event_ID. For example, one digit or bit in the event_ID could signal a change from an odd to an even key, in a manner known in conventional Conditional Access schemes. Thus, it is possible to provide a third event in advance of the second event. The event_ID uniquely associated to the third event triggers the handset to change keys, but the change takes effect a pre-determined number of events subsequent to the third event.<br>
The invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments, but may be varied within the scope of the claims. For example, the home network 5 may be wireless, in accordance with one of the Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11 or UWB standards. Alternatively, it may use optical links, for example in accordance with the IrDA standard, or it may be include wired USB or Ethernet connections. The digital rights issuer module may be placed in a smart card or secure hardware token as an alternative to the smart card 24.<br>
