DESCRIPTION OPTICAL RECORDING MEDIUM<br>
Technical Filed<br>
The  invention  is  related  to   an  optical  recording  medium capable of recording and reproducing information by laser light. The   optical   recording   medium   is   also   capable   of   forming   an image by laser light. Background Art<br>
In the field of optical recording media such as DVD-R, an optical disc has been put to practical use which has an ink-receiving layer (printing layer) disposed on the label side (the side opposite to the side to be irradiated with laser light at recording or reproducing). Users can print a photograph or a picture on the printing layer by using an inkjet printer or the like.<br>
The system for printing an image by an inkjet printer or the like has been developing steadily, and the image quality has become superior. On the other hand, it is costly to newly prepare an inkjet printer or the like for forming an image. Further, it is troublesome to transfer an optical recording medium to an inkjet printer or the like for image formation after recording of information on the optical recording medium. Particularly, it takes a lot of trouble to record information on a<br><br>
plurality of optical recording media, and then to form images on the optical recording media.<br>
To lighten the burden, an image forming apparatus and an image forming method have been proposed (for example in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 2004-005848, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference) which can record a high-contrast ratio image on an optical disc, in addition to information recording on the recording surface of the optical disc. The image forming apparatus has functions of forming an image on the label side of the optical information medium and controlling the positioning in the direction of the radius of the disc by a stepping motor without using tracking systems. Since the image forming apparatus records an image without using tracking systems, the accuracy and stability of the image recording are not secured, whereby information cannot be recorded on the region on which the image has been formed.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
The invention provides an optical recording medium. The optical recording medium comprises a first substrate and a second substrate which are adhered to each other. The first and second substrates each have a wobble. The amplitude ratio (A) of the wobble formed on the first substrate is larger than the amplitude    ratio    (B)    of   the    wobble    formed    on    the    second<br><br>
substrate.<br>
The ratio of the wobble amplitude ratio (A) to the wobble amplitude ratio (B) is preferably 1.2 or higher. The first substrate preferably has an image-recording layer capable of forming a visible image, on the side of the first substrate which side is to be adhered to the second substrate. The second substrate preferably has an information-recording layer capable of recording and reproducing information by an optical method, on the side of the second substrate which side is to be adhered to the first substrate.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The optical recording medium of the invention comprises two substrates (a first substrate and a second substrate) which are adhered to each other and which each have a wobble.<br>
The wobble may be, for example, a winding of the groove with a constant amplitude and spatial frequency. The wobble is provided on the substrate so as to provide a signal for controlling a spindle motor or so as to provide a gate signal for detecting a land pre-pit.<br>
In the invention, the amplitude ratio (A) of the wobble formed on the first substrate is larger than the amplitude ratio (B) of the wobble formed on the second substrate. As described later, recording for separate purposes can be conducted because<br><br>
of the  difference  in  amplitude  ratio between the wobble  on  the first    substrate and the wobble on the second substrates.<br>
In an embodiment, an image-recording layer capable of forming a visible image is provided on the side (to which the second substrate is adhered) of the first substrate having a larger wobble amplitude ratio and an information-recording layer capable of optically recording and reproducing information is provided on the side (to which the first substrate is adhered) of the second substrate having a smaller wobble amplitude ratio.<br>
In general, a larger wobble amplitude is preferable from the controllability of the rotation. However, an excessively high wobble amplitude ratio is likely to cause errors in the case of an information-recording layer.<br>
On the other hand, the image-recording layer is satisfactory if the image is observable with the naked eye. Accordingly, it is not necessary to pay attention to the occurrence of errors which is an big issue in the case of the information-recording layer. Therefore, the substrate (the first substrate) on which an image-recording layer is to be provided may have a higher wobble amplitude ratio than the substrate (the second substrate) on which an information-recording layer is to be provided.<br>
The ratio of the wobble amplitude ratio (A) to the wobble amplitude ratio (B) is preferably 1.2 or higher. When the wobble amplitude ratio (A)  is at least  1.2 times higher than the wobble<br><br>
amplitude ratio (B), the recording on the image-recording layer can be conducted stably while suppressing the occurrence of errors in the information-recording layer. The ratio of the wobble amplitude ratio (A) to the wobble amplitude ratio (B) is more preferably 1.3 to 2.5, still more preferably 1.5 to 2.3.<br>
In this specification, the term "wobble amplitude ratio11 (the amplitude ratio of wobble) refers to the ratio of the average wobble amplitude taken over one circuit to the average TE (Tracking Error) signal amplitude taken over one circuit. In other words, the wobble amplitude ratio on a disc (substrate) is expressed by the following expression:<br>
Wobble amplitude ratio = [wobble amplitude (average of P-P (peak-to-peak) value taken over the course of one circuit on the disc)]/[TE signal amplitude (average of P-P (peak-to-peak) value taken over the course of one circuit on the disc)]<br>
The ratio of the wobble amplitude ratio (A) to the wobble amplitude ratio (B) is preferably in the above-described range. The respective wobble amplitude ratios (A) and (B) are preferably in the following range.<br>
The wobble amplitude ratio (A) is preferably 0.09 to 0.40, more preferably 0.12 to 0.24. The wobble amplitude ratio (B) is preferably 0.06 to 0.25, more preferably 0.08 to 0.18.<br>
The respective amplitude ratios (A) and (B) can be adjusted by controlling the wobble shape (the amplitude of the meandering groove) during the formation of the substrate.<br><br>
The type of the optical recording medium of the invention is not particularly limited as long as the optical recording medium has the image-recording layer and the information-recording layer. The optical recording medium may be a write-once optical recording medium or a rewritable optical recording medium. The optical recording medium may be an optical recording medium of a phase change type, a magnetooptical type, or a dye type. The optical recording medium is preferably a write-once dye-type optical recording medium in consideration of capability of forming clear pits and producibility at a low cost.<br>

Protective Layer<br>
A protective layer is provided in some cases, in order to protect the reflection layer, the recording layer, or the like physically and chemically.<br>
Examples of the material used in the protective layer include inorganic substances such as ZnS, ZnS-SiO2, SiO, SiO2, MgF2, SnO2, and Si3N4j and organic substances such as thermoplastic resins, thermosetting resins, and UV-setting resins. The protective layer may be formed by: preparing a film by an extrusion-molding of a plastic, and laminating the film on the reflection layer via an intervening adhesive. As an alternative, the protective layer may be formed by a method such as vacuum deposition, sputtering, or coating.<br>
When the protective layer material is a thermoplastic resin or a thermosetting resin, the protective layer may be formed by: dissolving the thermoplastic or thermosetting resin in an appropriate solvent to form a coating liquid, and then coating the coating liquid followed by drying. When the protective layer material is a UV-setting resin, the protective layer may be formed by: dissolving the UV-setting resin in an appropriate solvent to form a coating liquid, and then coating the coating liquid, and then irradiating the coating film with UV light to cure the film. In the above methods, the coating liquids may further include various additives such as antistatic agents, antioxidants, and UV absorbers,   in  accordance   with   the   purpose.     The   thickness  of<br><br>
the protective layer is preferably 0.1 |im to 1 mm. Recording Method<br>
In the method of recording on the optical recording medium of the invention, the recording of the image on the image-recording layer and the recording of the information on the information-recording layer may be conducted by a single optical disc drive (recording instrument) capable of recording on both of the recording layers, or may be conducted separately by a recording instrument exclusively for recording on the image-recording layer and a recording instrument exclusively for recording on the information-recording layer, respectively. In both cases, after the recording on one of the image-recording layer and the information-recording layer is conducted, the optical recording medium may be turned over so as to enable the recording on the other recording layer. Examples of the optical disc drive capable of recording a visible image on the image-recording layer are disclosed, for example, in JP-A Nos. 2003-203348 and 2003-242750, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The recording of a visible image on the image-recording layer is conducted by: moving the optical recording medium or the laser pickup or both such that the optical recording medium and the laser pickup move relative to each other and that the relative movement is in the direction of a radius on the plane of the       optical       recording      medium,       while       irradiating      the<br><br>
image-recording layer with a laser light in synchronization with the relative movement, the laser light being modulated in accordance with the image data (such as a character or a picture) to be recorded. Such a constitution is described, for example, in JP-A No. 2002-203321, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The laser light for recording may be a semiconductor laser having an oscillation wavelength in the range of 350 to 850 nm.<br>
When the information-recording layer is a phase change information-re cording layer, the information-recording layer comprises a substance such as described above, and the phase transition between the crystal phase and the amorphous phase can be repeated by irradiation with laser light.<br>
Upon recording of information, the phase change recording layer is irradiated with a focused laser light pulse for a short time to melt the phase change recording layer partially. The melted portion is rapidly cooled by heat diffusion to solidify, thereby forming a recording mark in the amorphous state. Upon erasing the information, the recording mark portion is irradiated with laser light to be heated to a temperature which is in the range of from the crystallization temperature of the recording layer to the melting point of the recording layer inclusive, and then slowly cooled to crystallize the recording mark in the amorphous state, thereby returning the recording mark portion to the initial unrecorded state.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The   present   invention   is   described   in   more   detail   with reference to Examples.    However, the invention is not limited to the Examples. Example 1 Production of Optical Recording Medium<br>
The optical recording medium of this Example is a DVD-R type optical recording medium comprising two substrates attached to each other. In the following, the method of producing the optical recording medium is described.<br>
A second substrate was formed from a polycarbonate resin by injection molding. The second substrate had a thickness of 0.6mm and a diameter of 120 mm, and had a spiral (helical) groove. The spiral groove had a depth of 130 nm, a width of 300 nm, a track pitch of 0.74 jam, and a wobble amplitude ratio (B) of 0.16. 0.75 g of a dye A shown below and 0.50 g of a dye B shown below were dissolved in 100 ml of 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoro-l-propanol to form a coating liquid, and the substrate surface having the groove was coated with the coating liquid by spin coating to form an information-recording layer. Then, silver was sputtered to form a reflection layer having a thickness of 120 nm on the information-recording layer. Then, the reflection layer was coated with a UV-setting resin (SD318 manufactured by Dainippon Ink and Chemicals Incorporated.) by<br><br>
spin coating, and then the UV-setting resin was irradiated with UV light to cure, thereby forming a protective layer having a thickness of 10 \im.<br>
Through the processes described above, a laminate (2) was obtained which comprised the second substrate and the information-recording layer, the reflection layer, and the protective layer disposed in this order on the second substrate.<br><br><br><br>
A first substrate was formed from a polycarbonate resin by injection molding. The first substrate had a thickness of 0.6mm and a diameter of 120 mm, and had a spiral (helical) groove. The spiral groove had a depth of 130 nm, a width of 300 nm5 a track pitch of 0.74 jam, and a wobble amplitude ratio (A) of 0.24. Subsequently, 0.75 g of the dye A and 0.50 g of a dye C shown below were dissolved in 100 ml of 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoro-l-propanol to form a coating liquid. The surface of the first substrate having the groove was coated with the coating liquid by spin coating to form an image-recording layer. Then, silver was sputtered to form a reflection layer having a thickness of 120 nm on the image-recording layer. Subsequently, the reflection layer was coated with a UV-setting resin (SD318 manufactured by Dainippon Ink and Chemicals Incorporated.) by spin coating, then the UV-setting resin was irradiated with UV light to cure, thereby forming a protective layer having a thickness of 10 jam. Through the processes described above, a laminate (1) was obtained which comprised the first substrate and the image-recording layer, the reflection layer, and the protective layer disposed in this order on the first substrate.<br><br><br>
Subsequently, the laminate (1) and the laminate (2) were adhered to each other to form an optical recording material through the following processes.<br>
A slow-acting cation polymerization type adhesive (SDK7000 manufactured by Sony Chemicals Corporation) was printed on the protective layers of the respective laminates by screen printing. The mesh size of the printing plate used for the screen printing was 300 mesh. Then, the printed adhesive was irradiated with UV rays, using a metal halide lamp. Immediately after the irradiation, the laminate (1) and the laminate (2) were adhered to each other such that the protective layers of the laminates (1) and (2) faced each other. Then, pressure was applied to both sides, and the adhered laminates were left in this state   for   5   minutes   to   form   an   optical   recording   medium   of<br><br>
Example 1.<br>
The    wobble    amplitude    ratios    (A)    and    (B)    were    each obtained by normalizing the wobble amplitude by the TE signal amplitude,      using      a      disc      drive      instrument      (DDU1000 manufactured by Pulsetec Indurstrial Co., Ltd.). Examples 2 and 3 and Comparative Example 1 (Production of Optical Recording Medium)<br>
Optical recording media were each produced in the same manner as in Example 1, except that the shape of the wobble (the amplitude of the meandering groove) formed on the first substrate was adjusted by changing the stamper used for the injection molding of the first substrate such that the ratio of the wobble amplitude ratio (A) to the wobble amplitude ratio (B) were changed to the value shown in Table 1.<br>
The amplitude ratios (A) of the wobbles formed on the first substrates in Example 2, Example 3, and Comparative Example 1 were 1.2, 2.4, and 1.0, respectively. (Evaluation)<br>
The firmware of a commercially available DVD±R drive was modified, so that a drive was obtained which could read the LPP (Land PrePit) information on the image-recording side and could form an image.<br>
Using the modified drive instrument, image recording was conducted on the image-recording layers of the optical recording media of Examples   1   to 3  and Comparative  Example   1.    It was<br><br>
confirmed in each Example whether the image was accurately recorded on the recording layer or whether the image recording was inaccurate.    The results are shown in Table 1 below.<br>
The term "inaccurate recording" refers to the state in which image shift or blur occurs in the formed image owing to irregular rotating velocity or the state in which the image recording stops before completion.<br><br>
As is shown in Table 1, inaccurate recording occurred in Comparative Example 1. In contrast, the image quality was excellent in all of Examples 1 to 3 without occurrence of inaccurate recording on the image-recording layer.<br>
As described above, the present invention provides an optical recording medium capable of forming an image stably with a high drawing accuracy. The optical recording medium of the invention is capable of recording and reproducing general optical information, and is also capable of forming a visible image thereon.<br><br>
