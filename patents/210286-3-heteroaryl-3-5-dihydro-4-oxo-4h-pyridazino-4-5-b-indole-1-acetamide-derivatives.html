Throughout the remainder of the description the intermediate compounds (II), (III), (IV) and (V) are those shown in the scheme below.<br><br>
6<br><br>
A compound of general formula (II) in which X and R1 are as defined above and R' represents a (C1-C4)alkyl group is treated with a 3-chloro-3-oxopropanoate of general formula CICOCH2CO2R", in which R" represents a (C1-C4)alkyl group, in a solvent such as dichloroethane at ambient temperature in the presence<br><br>
7<br>
of a Lewis acid, titanium tetrachloride for example, to<br>
give the diester of general formula (III).<br>
The keto ester function of the diester of general<br>
formula (III) is converted into keto amide to give the<br>
compound of general formula (IV) by the action of an<br>
amine of general formula HNR2R3, in which R2 and R3 are<br>
as defined above, in the presence of a catalyst such as<br>
4-(dimethylamino)pyridine,<br>
According to a first preparation pathway the compound<br>
of general formula (IV) is treated in a polar solvent<br>
in the presence of acid with a heteroarylhydrazine to<br>
give an amide of general formula (I).<br>
According to a second preparation pathway the compound<br>
of general formula (IV) is treated with hydrazine with<br>
heating in a solvent such as toluene in the presence of<br>
a catalytic amount of acid to give a pyridazinoindole<br>
of general formula (V). Finally an N-arylation reaction<br>
is performed on the pyridazinoindole of general formula<br>
(V) in the presence of a heteroaryl halide, or else of<br>
a heteroarylboronic acid derivative and a metal salt,<br>
such as a copper salt, leading to a compound of general<br>
formula (I).<br>
The reactants employed above are available commercially<br>
or are described in the literature, or else can be<br>
prepared by methods which are described therein or<br>
which are known to the skilled worker.<br>

Chem. 2000, 43, 4701).<br>
The invention also provides the compounds of general formula (III),<br><br>
in which<br>
X represents a hydrogen or halogen atom,<br>
R1 represents a hydrogen atom or a (C1-C4) alkyl group,<br>
R' and R", each independently of one another, represent<br>
a (C1-C4) alkyl group,<br>
which are useful as synthesis intermediates for<br>
preparing compounds of general formula (I).<br>
The invention additionally provides the compounds of general formula (IV),<br><br>

in which<br>
X represents a hydrogen or halogen atom,<br>
R1 represents a hydrogen atom or a (C1-C4)alkyl group,<br>
R' represents a (C1-C4)alkyl group,<br>
R2 and R3, each independently of one another, represent<br>
a hydrogen atom or a (C1-C4)alkyl group, or else R2 and<br>
R3, together with the nitrogen atom bearing them, form a<br>
pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, morpholinyl or 4-(C1-<br>
C4)alkylpiperazinyl group,<br>
which are useful as synthesis intermediates for<br>
preparing compounds of general formula (I).<br>
The invention further provides the compounds of general formula (V)<br><br>
in which<br>
X represents a hydrogen or halogen atom,<br>
Ri represents a hydrogen atom or a (C1-C4)alkyl group.<br><br>
10<br>
R2 and R3, each independently of one another, represent<br>
a hydrogen atom or a (C1-C4)alkyl group, or else R2 and<br>
R3, together with the nitrogen atom bearing them, form a<br>
pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, morpholinyl or 4-(C1-<br>

which are useful as synthesis intermediates for<br>
preparing compounds of general formula (I).<br>

A 60% suspension of 7.9 g (197 mmol) of sodium hydride (washed with petroleum ether beforehand) and 36.1 g (176 mmol) of methyl 6-fluoro-lH-indole-2-carboxylate (containing 10 to 20% of ethyl 6-fluoro-lH-indole-2-carboxylate) in 250 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide is<br><br>
11<br>
stirred at ambient temperature for 2 h. Then 12 ml (193 mmol) of iodomethane in 50 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide are added and the mixture is stirred at ambient temperature for 12 h.<br>
The contents are poured into an ice/water mixture. Dichloromethane is added and the aqueous phase is neutralized with hydrochloric acid (1N). The organic phase is separated off, washed with water, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is purified by chromatography on a silica gel column in a mixture of solvents (cyclohexane/dichloromethane: 50/50 to 0/100 then dichloromethane/ethyl acetate: 100/0 to 70/30). 32.7 g (170 mmol) are isolated of a white compound of methyl 6-fluoro-l-methyl-lH-indole-2-carboxylate containing 10 to 20% of ethyl 6-fluoro-l-methyl-ltf-indole-2-carboxylate.<br>
1.2.     methyl 3-[6-fluoro-2-(methoxycarbonyl)-1-methyl-lH-indol-3-yl]-3-oxopropanoate<br>
In portions, 6.5 ml (60 mmol) of methyl 3-chloro-3-oxo-propanoate are added to a solution of 6.6 ml (60 mmol) of titanium tetrachloride in 80 ml of 1,2-dichloro-ethane. The mixture is stirred at ambient temperature for 30 minutes. A solution of 5 g (24.1 mmol) of methyl 6-fluoro-l-methyl-l/f-indole-2-carboxylate (containing 10 to 20% of ethyl 6-fluoro-l-methyl-lH-indole-2-carboxylate), obtained in step 1.1., is added and the<br><br>
12<br>
mixture is stirred at 4 0°C for 20 h. The mixture is poured into ice water and extracted with dichioromethane. The organic phase is separated off, washed with water, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is purified by chromatography on a silica gel column (eluent: cyclohexane/dichloromethane; 90/10 to 0/100 then dichloromethane/ethyl acetate 100/0 to 50/50). This gives 13 g of a pasty solid containing primarily the compound. It is used as it is in the rest of the synthesis.<br>
1.3       W,W-dimethyl-3-[6-fluoro-2-(methoxycarbonyl)-l-methyl-lH-indol-3-yl3-3-oxopropanamide A stream of gaseous dimethylamine is passed into a mixture of 13 g (44.4 mmol) of methyl 3-[6-fluoro-2-(methoxycarbonyl)-l-methyl-lH-indol-3-yl]-3-oxo-propanoate, obtained in step 1.2., and 0.2 g (1.63 mmol) of 4-(N,N-dimethyl)aminopyridine in 80 ml of toluene. Immediately a condenser, surmounted by a balloon flask, is fitted and the solution is stirred at 100°C for 20 h. The mixture is cooled to ambient temperature and concentrated under reduced pressure. 200 ml of dichioromethane, water and hydrochloric acid (1N) are added. The organic phase is separated off, washed with water, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is purified by chromatography on a silica gel column<br><br>
13<br>
(eluent: cyclohexane/dichloromethane: 50/50, then dichloromethane/ethyl acetate 100/0 to 0/100). 4,6 g (14 mmol) are isolated of a yellow solid, which is used as it is in the rest of the synthesis. 1.4      7-f luoro-N,N, 5-trimethyl-4-oxo-3-(pyrid-2-yl)-3, 5-dihydro-4H-pyridazino[4,5-b]indole-1-acetamide A solution of 1.4 g (4.1 mmol) of N,N-dimethyl-3-[6-fluoro-2-(methoxycarbonyl)-l-methyl-lH-indol-3-yl]-3-oxopropanamide, obtained in step 1.3., in 40 ml of absolute ethanol is heated at reflux for 22 h with a few drops of glacial acetic acid and 1.4 g (12.8 mmol) of 2-pyridylhydrazine-<br>
The mixture is cooled and concentrated under reduced pressure. Water and 200 ml of dichloromethane are added. Sodium hydroxide solution is added to a pH &gt; 10. The organic phase is separated off, washed with water, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is purified by chromatography on a silica gel column in a mixture of solvents (dichloromethane/ethyl acetate: 100/0 to 0/100, then ethyl acetate/rnethanol: 100/0 to 90/10). The product obtained is subsequently chromatographed on a neutral alumina column in a mixture of solvents<br>
(dichloromethane/ethyl acetate: 100/0 to 0/100, then ethyl acetate/methanol: 100/0 to 90/10). This gives a solid, which is rinsed with diethyl ether. 0.25 g (0.66 mmol) of compound is isolated in the form<br><br>

2.1	ethyl 3-[6-chloro-2-(methoxycarbonyl)-1-<br>
methyl-lH-indol-3-yl]-3-oxopropanoate<br>
A solution of 6.2 ml (48.4 mmol) of ethyl 3-chloro-3-oxopropanoate in 70 ml of 1,2-dichloroethane is cooled to 0°C. In small portions 5.3 ml (48.3 mmol) of titanium tetrachloride are added and the mixture is stirred at 0°C for 30 minutes. A solution of 4.3 g (19.2 mmol) of methyl 6-chloro-l-methyl-lH~indole-2-carboxylate in 35 ml of 1,2-dichloroethane is added and the mixture is stirred at ambient temperature for 12 h. It is poured into ice water and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic phase is separated off, washed with water, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is purified by chromatography on a silica gel column (eluent: cyclohexane/ethyl acetate: 90/10 to 80/20). This gives a yellow solid, which is triturated in heptane and then in diisopropyl ether.<br>
2.84 g (8.4 mmol) of compound are recovered, in the form of a cream-colored solid.<br>
2.2	3-[6-chloro-2-(methoxycarbonyl)-1-methyl-lH-<br><br>

indol-3-yl]-N,N-dimethyl-3~oxopropanamide A stream of gaseous dimethylamine is passed into a mixture of 15 g (44.4 mmol) of ethyl 3-[6-chloro-2-(methoxycarbonyl)-l-methyl-lH-indol-3-yl]-3-oxo-propanoate, obtained in step 2.1., and 0.2 g (1.63 mmol) of 4-(N,N-dimethyl)aminopryridine in 100 ml of toluene. Immediately a condenser, surmounted by a balloon flask, is fitted and the solution is stirred at 100°C under low pressure for 20 h. The mixture is cooled to ambient temperature and concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue is chromatographed on a silica gel column (eluent: cyclohexane/dichloromethane: 50/50, then dichloromethane/ethyl acetate: 100/0 to 0/100). This gives 3.8 g of a yellow solid which is recrystallized from a dichloromethane/ethyl acetate mixture.<br>
1.8 g (5.3 mmol) are isolated of a yellow-white solid. 2.3      7-chloro-itf,N, 5-trimethyl-4-oxo-3,5-dihydro-4#-pyridazino[4,5-b]indole-1-acetamide A solution of 1.7 g (5.2 mmol) of 3-[6-chloro-2-(methoxycarbonyl)-l-methyl-lH-indol-3-yl]-W,W-dimethyl-3-oxopropanamide, obtained in step 2.2., in 150 ml of toluene is heated at 90°C for 24 h in the presence of 1.8 ml (36.8 mmol) of hydrazine monohydrate and a catalytic amount of p-toluenesulfonic acid.

Study of [3H]Ro5-4864 binding to peripheral benzo-diazepine receptors (PBR or p sites).<br>
The affinity of the compounds of the<br>
invention for PBR or p sites (peripheral-type binding sites on benzodiazepines) was determined. The p site receptors can be labeled selectively in rat kidney membranes incubated in the presence of [3H]Ro5-4864. The compounds of the invention formed the object of an in vitro study with respect to their affinity for these receptors.<br>
The animals used are male Sprague-Dawley rats (Iffa Credo) weighing 180 to 300 mg. Following decapitation, the kidney is removed and the tissue is homogenized at 4°C using a Polytron™ homogenizer for 2 min at 6/10 of the maximum speed in 35 volumes of 50 mM Na2HPO4 phosphate buffer at a pH adjusted to 7.5 with NaH2PO4-The membrane homogenate is filtered through gauze and diluted 10 times with the buffer.<br>
[3H]Ro5-4864 (specific activity: 70-90 Ci/mmol; New England Nuclear) at a concentration of 0.5 nM is incubated in the presence of 100 ?l of membrane homogenate in a final volume of 1 ml of buffer<br><br>
24<br>
containing the test compound.<br>
After incubation at 0°C for 3 h the membranes are<br>
recovered by filtration on Whatman GF/B™ filters washed<br>
with 2 times 4.5 ml of cold (0°C) incubation buffer. The<br>
amount of radioactivity retained by the filter is<br>
measured by liquid scintigraphy.<br>
For each concentration of compound studied, the<br>
percentage inhibition of the binding of [3H]Ro5-4864,<br>
and then the IC50 concentration, the concentration which<br>
inhibits 50% of the specific binding, are determined.<br>
The IC50 values of the best compounds of the invention<br>
range from 1 nM to 200 nM.<br>
The compounds of the invention are therefore ligands<br>
with affinity for peripheral benzodiazepine receptors.<br>
Study of neurotropic activity.<br>
Tests of survival of motor neurons following section of<br>
the facial nerve in 4-day-old rats<br>
After lesion of the facial nerve in the immature rat,<br>
the motor neurons of the facial nucleus suffer neuronal<br>
death by apoptosis. Neuronal survival is evaluated by<br>
means of histological and neuronal counting methods.<br>
Immature rats 4 days old are anesthetized with<br>
pentobarbital (3 mg/kg i.p.). The right facial nerve is<br>
exposed and sectioned, at its outlet from the<br>
stylomastoid foramen. After waking, the young rats are<br>
returned to their mother and treated for 7 days, with<br>
one or two administrations daily, orally or<br><br>
25<br>
intraperitoneally, at doses ranging from 1 to 10 mg/kg. 7 days after the lesion, the animals are decapitated and the brains are frozen in isopentane at -40°C. The facial nucleus is cut with a cryostat into 10 ?m sections, in its entirety. The motor neurons are stained with cresyl violet and counted using the Histo™ software (Biocom™).<br>
In this model the compounds of the invention increased neuronal survival by approximately 10 to 30%.<br>
The results of the tests show that compounds of the invention promote nerve regeneration.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can therefore be used for preparing medicinal products.<br>
Thus according to another of its aspects the invention provides medicinal products which comprise a compound of formula (I) or an addition salt thereof with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid or else a hydrate or a solvate of the compound of formula (I).<br>
These medicinal products find their application in therapeutics, particularly for the prevention and/or treatment of peripheral neuropathies of various types, such as traumatic or ischemic neuropathies, infectious, alcoholic, medicinal or genetic neuropathies, and motor neuron conditions, such as spinal amyotrophies and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These medicinal products will also find application in the treatment of neurodegenerative<br><br>
diseases of the central nervous system, either of acute type, such as cerebral vascular accidents and cranial and medullar traumas, or of chronic type, such as autoimmune diseases (multiple sclerosis), Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and any other disease in which the administration of neurotrophic factors is supposed to have a therapeutic effect.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can also be used in the treatment of acute or chronic renal insufficiency, glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, cardiac ischemia and cardiac insufficiency, myocardial infarction, ischemia of the lower limbs, coronary vasospasm, angina pectoris, pathologies associated with the heart valves, inflammatory heart diseases, side effects due to cardiotoxic medicaments or following cardiac surgery, atherosclerosis and its thromboembolic complications, restenosis, graft rejections, or ailments linked to incorrect proliferation or incorrect migration of the smooth muscle cells.<br>
Furthermore, recent data in the literature indicate that the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor might play a fundamental part in the regulation of cell proliferation and cancerization processes. Generally, and in comparison with normal tissues, an increased density of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors is observed in various types of tumors and cancers.<br><br>
27<br>
In human astocytomas the degree of expression of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor is correlated with the degree of malignancy of the tumor, the proliferation index and the survival of the patients. In human cerebral tumors the increase in the number of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors is used as a diagnostic indication in medical imaging and as a therapeutic target for conjugates formed from a ligand of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor and a cytostatic drug. A high density of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors is also observed in ovarian carcinomas and breast cancers. As regards the latter, it has been demonstrated that the degree of expression of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptors is related to the aggression potential of the tumor; moreover, the presence of a peripheral benzodiazepine receptor agonist stimulates the growth of a mammary cancer line.<br>
The entirety of these results, which suggests a deleterious function of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor in cancerization processes, constitutes a relevant basis for the search for synthetic ligands specific to the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor which are capable of blocking its effects.<br>
The compounds can therefore be used for treating tumors and cancers.<br>
Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors are also present in the skin and, in this respect, the compounds<br><br>
28<br>
which can be used according to the invention can be used for the prophylaxis or treatment of cutaneous stresses.<br>
By cutaneous stresses are meant the various situations which could cause damage, in particular to the epidermis, irrespective of the agent causing this stress. That agent may be internal and/or external to the body, such as a chemical or free-radical agent, or else external, such as ultraviolet radiation. Accordingly the compounds which can be used according to the invention are intended for preventing and combating skin irritation, dry patches, erythemas, disesthesic sensations, heating sensations, pruritus of the skin and/or of the mucosae, or ageing, and can also be used in skin disorders such as, for example, psoriasis, pruriginous diseases, herpes, photodermatoses, atopic dermatites, contact dermatites, lichens, prurigos, insect stings, in fibroses and other collagen maturation disorders, in immunological disorders or,else in dermatological conditions, such as eczema.<br>
The compounds of the invention can also be used for preventing and treating chronic inflammatory diseases, especially rheumatoid arthritis.<br>

administration consideration may be given to creams,<br>
gels, ointments, lotions or eyewashes.<br>
These pharmaceutical forms are prepared in accordance<br>
with the methods that are customary in the fields in<br>
question.<br>
Said unit forms are dosed so as to allow daily administration of from 0.001 to 20 mg of active principle per kg of body weight, depending on the pharmaceutical form.<br>
There may be specific cases in which higher or lower doses are appropriate; such dosages are not outside the scope of the invention. In accordance with common practice, the dosage appropriate to each patient is determined by the clinician in accordance with the method of administration, the weight and the response of said patient.<br>
The present invention according to another of its aspects also provides a method of treating the pathologies indicated above which comprises administering to a patient an effective dose of a compound according to the invention or one of its pharmaceutically acceptable salts or hydrates or solvates.<br><br>
