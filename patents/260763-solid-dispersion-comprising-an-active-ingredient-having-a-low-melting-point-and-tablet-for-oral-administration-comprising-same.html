The obtained agglomerate is homogeneously mixed with kneade -mixer, and the mixtures are filtered through a screen to obtain a fused solid dispersion having a uniform size.<br>
In this process, the length of the time the active ingredient is exposed to the heat is shortened, and a fused solid dispersion having a uniform size distribution can be obtained. Thus, a fused solid dispersion having a uniform size distribution can be manufactured by a less time-consuming single process which is conducted by carrying out the inputting, melting and screening of the active ingredients in sequence.<br><br>
Various types of tablets such as controlled release tablet, rapid release tablet and multilayer tablet can be prepared by optionally adding a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient to the fused solid dispersion and compressing into a tablet without the use of a cooler. The compressed tablet preferably has a hardness in the range from 4 to 16 kp, preferably 8 to 12 kp.<br>
(A) Controlled release tablet<br>
A controlled release tablet comprises the above-mentioned fused solid dispersion and a release-controlling agent and may further comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient The weight ratio of the fused solid dispersion : the release-controlling agent: the pharmaceutically acceptable excipient ranges from 1 :0.01 -3:0-3, and preferably, from 1:0.05-2:0.01-2.<br>
(A-1) Release'-controlltng agent	<br>
The release-controlling agent for maintaining uniform release rate for a long period of time can be selected from the group consisting of polyethylene oxide having a molecular weight ranging from 10,000 to 9,000,000, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose having a molecular weight ranging from 1,000 to 4,000,000, hydroxypropyl cellulose, carboxyvinyl polymer, polyvinyl alcohol, xanthan gum, guar gum, locust bean gum, carboxymethyl cellulose and its derivative, methyl cellulose and its derivative, and povidone-polyvinylacetate copolymer having a molecular weight ranging from 2,000 to 2,000,000. In accordance with the present invention, the weight ratio of the fused solid dispersion : release-controlling agent may range from 1 : 0.01 -3, and preferably, from 1 : 0.05-2.<br>

In the present inventkm, a rapid release tablet comprises the above-mentioned fused solid dispersion, and the above-mentioned pharmaceutically acceptable excipient used in the controlled release tablet The weight ratio of the fused solid dispersion : the pharmaceutically acceptable excipient may range from 1 : 0.05 ~3, and preferably, from 1 : 0.1-2.<br>
(O Multilayer tablet<br>
A multilayer tablet in accordance with the present invention may be prepared by forming a controlled release layer with ingredients of the controlled release tablet and by forming a rapid release layer with ingredients of thee rapid release tablet to manipulate the release of the active ingredient<br>
The bilayer tablet consisting of the rapid release tablet and the controlled release layer can be prepared by subjecting the ingredient for the rapid release layer to a first tablet compression step, depositing the ingredients for the controlled release layer mereon, and subjecting the resulting mixture to a second tablet compression step. The tablet compression process of the controlled release layer does not always have to be carried out after tabletting the rapid release layer. The tablet compression of the controlled release layer can be carried out first, and then the granules of the rapid release layer are added thereto, followed of tablet compression. Also the rapid release layer and the controlled release layer can be sequentially or reversely filled, which is compressed into a tablet in one step.<br>
The multilayer tablet of the present invention can be also prepared as a trilayer tablet consisting of rapid release and controlled release layers.<br>
When the tablet consisting of the rapid release layer and the controlled release layer comprising the same active ingredient according to the present invention is subjected to in vitro release tests in accordance with the paddle method at 100 rpm (Korea pharmacopoeia 8th ed. in vitro dissolution tests 2nd method) using 900mL of artificial gastric fluid(Korea pharmacopoeia 8th ed., the 2 nd solution for the disintegrating-test), 85% or more of me active ingredient of the rapid release layer preferably is reteased within about 1 hour after initiating the test, while the active ingredient of the controlled release layer is released sequentially, preferably in amounts corresponding to 1 to 30% within about 1 hour, 30 to 70% within about 5 hours, and 85% or more within 12 hours after initiating the test<br>
The span of the release time of the active ingredient of the controlled release layer or the controlled release tablet can be prolonged by controlling the type and amount of excipient used in the controlled release layer. When in vitro dissolution tests were conducted according to the above method, the active ingredient of the rapid release layer in the multilayer tablet is released, preferably in amounts corresponding to 1 to 30% within 1 hour, 30 to 70% within 6 hours, 60 to 90% within 12 hours, 80% or more within 24 hours after initiating the test.<br>
The rapidly-released active ingredient allows the plasma drug concentration to promptly reach the effective treating level while the slowly-released active ingredient can maintain the effective plasma drug concentration during the intended time. Thus, the pharmaceutically useful tablet according to the present invention is easily prepared without being hindered by such problems as capping and sticking during the course of compression tabletting, which can be effectively implemented in a large-scale manufacturing process.<br>

Test Example 6: In vitro dissolution test of bilayer tablet (2) as function of the rotation number<br>
In vitro dissolution test was conducted using the bilayer tablet prepared in Example 16 under the following conditions, and the results are shown in Table 11 and Fig. 5.<br><dissolution test method><br>
Sample : Biayer tablet prepared in Example 16<br>
Test solution: The disintegrating-test 2nd method described in Korea<br>
pharmacopoeia, pH 6.8 artificial gastric fluid, 900 mL, 37 ± 0.5 °C<br>
Dissolution   method:   The   dissolution   test   method   described   in   Korea pharmacopoeia (the paddle method), rotation speed: 50, 100 and 150 rpm<br>
Table 11  (Table Removed)<br><br>
As can be seen from Table 11 and Fig. 5, the tablet rapidly released the drug in the initial 1 hour to provide fast therapeutical effects, followed by a steady release pattern of the drugs suitable for continuously mantaining the therapeutical effect.<br>
Accordingly, as shown from the result of the dissolution test, the active ingredient of the rapid release portion was rapidly released within the initial 1 hour to attain an effective blood concentration thereof, exerting fast therapeutical effects. The active ingredient of the controlled release portion was slowly released over a period of 12 to 24 hours, thereby maintaining an effective concentration of the drug in the blood at a constant level during the intended time.<br>
