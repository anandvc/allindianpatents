Separation of 6-aminocapronitrile from mixtures containing 6-aminocapronitrile, adipodinitrile and hexamethylenediamine<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the distillative separation of 6-aminocapronitrile from mixtures containing 6-aminocapronitrile, adipodinitrile and hexamethylenediamine, wherein<br>
a)	the hexamethylenediamine is separated from the mixture to give a mixture (I) with a hexamethylenediamine content of less than 1% by weight;<br>
b)	all or part of the 6-aminocapronitrile is separated from the mixture (I) to give a mixture (II) whose content of substances which boil above 6-aminocapronitrile under distillation conditions and cannot be formed by dimerization reactions of 6-aminocapronitrile under thermal stress is less than 1% by weight; and<br>
c)	all or part of the hexamethylenediamine present is separated from the mixture (II) to give a mixture (IV) whose hexamethylenediamine content is higher than that of the mixture (II), and a mixture (V) whose hexamethylenediamine content is lower than that of the mixture (II)-<br>
It is known that 6-aminocapronitrile can be used for the preparation of caprolactam or polyamides.  The 6-aminocapronitrile must have a high purity for such purposes.<br>
6-Aminocapronitrile is conventionally prepared by the partial catalytic hydrogenation of adipodinitrile, which can be obtained by the double hydrocyanation of butadiene in the presence of catalysts.  This normally gives a mixture containing 6-aminocapronitrile/ unreacted adipodinitrile and hexamethylenediamine, optionally together with solvents, substances boiling below hexamethylenediamine, substances boiling above adipodinitrile, and other by-products.<br>
Numerous processes for the separation of 6-aminocapronitrile from such mixtures to give a 6-aminocapronitrile of said high purity are known, for example from WO 96/20931 and WO 97/23454.<br>
The disadvantage of these processes is the high energy expenditure required to recover 6-aminocapronitrile of sufficient purity from the mixture.<br><br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process which makes it possible, in a technically simple and economic manner and avoiding said disadvantages, to recover 6-aminocapronitrile of sufficient purity from mixtures containing 6-aminocapronitrile, adipodinitrile, hexamethylenediamine and optionally solvents and other secondary components.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the process defined at the outset.<br>
Processes for the preparation of mixtures containing 6-aminocapronitrile, adipodinitrile, hexamethylenediamine and optionally solvents, substances boiling below<br>
hexamethylenediamine, substances boiling above adipodinitrile, and other by-products are known per se.<br>
Thus mixtures containing 6-aminocapronitrile, adipodinitrile and hexamethylenediamine can be obtained by the partial catalytic hydrogenation of adipodinitrile.<br>
Based on the sum of 6-aminocapronitrile, adipodinitrile and hexamethylenediamine, such mixtures conventionally contain from 5 to 90% by weight, preferably from 10 to 80% by weight and particularly preferably from 20 to 70% by weight of 6-aminocapronitrile and from 5 to 90% by weight, preferably from 10 to 80% by weight and particularly preferably from 20 t'o 70% by weight of hexamethylenediamine, the remainder being unreacted adipodinitrile.<br>
In the light of previous observations, the catalyst used for the hydrogenation is not critical in terms of the process according to the invention.  The mixture can take place [sic] from the catalyst after the hydrogenation in a manner known per se, for example by filtration, this being preferred in the case of a suspension hydrogenation, or by removal of the mixture from the reaction vessel to leave the catalyst in the reaction vessel, this being preferred in the case of a fixed bed hydrogenation.<br>
The hydrogenation can advantageously be carried out in the presence of a solvent.  Suitable solvents are organic solvents such as alcohols, preferably alkanols and especially Cx-C^ alkanols like methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, i-propanol, n-butanol, i-butanol or s-butanol, esters, preferably esters of an alkanecarboxylic acid, especially a C1-C4 alkanecarboxylic acid t like formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid or butyric acid, with an alkanol, especially a C1-C4 alkanol like methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, i-propanol, n-butanol, i-butanol or<br><br>
s-butanol, ethers such as linear or cyclic ethers, for example iimethyl ether, diethyl ether, methyl t-butyl ether or :etrahydrofuran, hydrocarbons such as aliphatic or aromatic lydrocarbons, for example benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, -xylene, m-xylene or p-xylene, amines such as primary, secondary r tertiary amines, lactones such as butyrolactone, lactams such is caprolactam, pyrrolidone or N-methylpyrrolidone, and amides, Dr inorganic solvents such as ammonia, or mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferred solvents are alcohols, especially methanol and ethanol, aromatic hydrocarbons, especially toluene, and ammonia, or nixtures thereof.<br>
If the hydrogenation is carried out in the presence of a solvent, the reaction mixture will then contain this solvent.  Prior to the process according to the invention, the solvent can advantageously be separated from the reaction mixture in a manner known per se, for example by distillation or rectification.<br>
This separation can advantageously be performed by fractional distillation in one or more, such as 2 or 3, distillation apparatuses.<br>
Suitable apparatuses are those conventionally used for<br>
distillation, for example those described in: Kirk-Othmer, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 3rd ed., vol. 7, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1979, pages 870-881, such as sieve-plate columns, bubble-cap columns or packed columns, with.or without a side discharge.<br>
By-products, for example substances boiling below hexamethylenediamine and/or substances boiling above adipodinitrile, can be formed in the hydrogenation.<br>
In terms of the present invention, substances boiling below hexamethylenediamine are understood as meaning compounds which have a boiling point below that of hexamethylenediamine under the appropriate distillation conditions.<br>
Examples of possible substances boiling below hexamethylenediamine are hexamethyleneimine, hfexylaitfihe,-aminomethylcyclopentylamine and diaminocyclohexane.  Such compounds are present in the mixtures obtained from the hydrogenation in overall amounts of up to 10% by weight, preferably of up to 5% by weight, based on the sum of 6-aminocapronitrile, adipodinitrile and hexamethylenediamine.<br><br>
Prior to the process according to the invention, substances boiling below hexamethylenediamine can advantageously be separated from the reaction mixture in a manner known per se, for example by distillation or rectification.<br>
This separation can advantageously be performed by fractional distillation in one or more, such as 2 or 3, distillation apparatuses.<br>
Suitable apparatuses are those conventionally used for distillation, for example those described in: Kirk-Othmer, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 3rd ed., vol. 7, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1979, pages 870-881, such as sieve-plate columns, bubble-cap columns or packed columns, with or without a side discharge.<br>
Any solvent used and any substances present which boil below<br>
hexamethylenediamine can be separated off simultaneously in step a or beforehand.  Preferably, any solvent used is separated off first (step aO), followed by any substances present which boil below hexamethylenediamine (step al).<br>
Step al should advantageously be carried out at a pressure below ambient atmospheric pressure, preferably'at an absolute pressure   below 500 mbar.<br>
According to the invention, hexamethylenediamine	is separated<br>
from the mixture in step a to give a mixture (I)	with a<br>
hexamethylenediamine content below 5% by weight,	preferably below<br>
1% by weight, based on the mixture (I).<br>
This separation can advantageously be performed by fractional distillation in one or more, such as 2 or 3, distillation apparatuses.<br>
Suitable apparatuses are those conventionally used for distillation, for example those described in: Kirk-Othmer, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 3rd ed., vol. 7, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1979, pages 870-881, such as sieve-plate columns, bubble-cap columns or packed columns, with or without a side discharge, preferably with a side discharge.<br>
Step a should advantageously be carried out at a pressure below ambient atmospheric pressure, preferably at an absolute pressure below 500 mbar.<br><br>
In one preferred embodiment, hexamethylenediamine and components boiling below hexamethylenediamine can be separated off together, i.e. steps al and. a can be carried out together.<br>
In this operation, hexamethylenediamine can advantageously be recovered at a side discharge.<br>
In one particularly preferred embodiment, the column used has a separating plate in the region between the feed and the side discharge.<br>
According to the invention, all or part of the<br>
6-aminocapronitrile is separated from the mixture (I) in step b to give a mixture (II) whose content of substances which boil above 6-aminocapronitrile under distillation conditions and cannot be formed by dimerization reactions of 6-aminocapronitrile under thermal stress is less than 2% by weight, preferably less than 0.1% by weight.<br>
This separation can advantageously be performed by fractional distillation in one or more, such as 2 or 3, distillation apparatuses.<br>
Suitable apparatuses are those conventionally used for distillation, for example those described in: Kirk-Othmer, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 3rd ed., vol.. 7, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1979, pages 870-881, such as sieve-plate<br>
columns, bubble-cap columns or packed columns, with or without a side discharge, preferably with a side discharge.<br>
Step b should advantageously be carried out at a pressure below ambient atmospheric pressure, preferably at an absolute pressure below 500 mbar.<br>
According to the invention, all or part of the<br>
hexamethylenediamine present is separated from the mixture (II) in step c to give a mixture (IV) whose hexamethylenediamine content is higher than that of the mixture (II), and a mixture (V) whose hexamethylenediamine content is lower than that of the xiixture (II) .<br>
This separation can advantageously be performed by fractional distillation in one or more, such as 2 or 3, distillation apparatuses.<br><br>
Suitable apparatuses are those conventionally used for distillation, for example those described in: Kirk-Othmer, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 3rd ed., vol. 7, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1979, p&amp;ges 870-881, such as sieve-plate columns, bubble-cap columns or packed columns, with or without a side discharge.<br>
Step c should advantageously be carried out at a pressure below ambient atmospheric pressure, preferably at an absolute pressure below 500 mbar.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the pressure in step a should be lower than the pressure in step c.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the mixture (IV) obtained in step c can be recycled into step a, the mixture (IV) preferably being vaporous.<br>
In another embodiment of step b in terms of the present invention, it is possible to allow a higher content of substances boiling above 6-aminocapronitrile to give a mixture (Ila) and separate components boiling above 6-aminocapronitrile from the mixture (Ila) to give a mixture (VI) whose 6-aminocapronitrile content is higher than that of the mixture (II), and a mixture (VII) whose 6-aminocapronitrile content is lower than that of the mixture (II).<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the mixture (VII) can be recycled into step b.<br>
The hexamethylenediamine content of the mixture (V) should advantageously be at most 5000 ppm, preferably 0 to 1000 ppm and particularly preferably 0 to 200 ppm, based on the weight of the mixture (V) .  The sum of the components of the mixture (V) other than 6-aminocapronitrile should advantageously be at most 5000 ppm, preferably 0 to 500 ppm and particularly preferably 0 to 200 ppm, based on the weight of the mixture (V).<br>
The total energy consumption of the process according to the invention, calculated as the sum of the energy consumptions in steps a, b and c, and optionally aO and al, is lower than the energy consumption required when the separation is carried out in only two steps a and c, and optionally aO and al, to achieve the same hexamethylenediamine content in the 6-aminocapronitrile separated off.<br><br>
In a distillation column Kl, 200 kg/h of a hydrogenation mixture containing 29% of hexamethylenediamine, 42% of<br>
6-aminocapronitrile, 27% of adipodinitrile, 0.5% of low-boiling components and 1.5% of high-boiling components were separated off so that 1.5 kg/h containing essentially low-boiling components were withdrawn at the top.<br>
58 kg/h of hexamethylenediamine with a 6-aminocapronitrile content of 110 ppm were withdrawn at a side discharge. 156.5 kg/h with a hexamethylenediamine content of 0.2% were withdrawn at the bottom of the column Kl.  Said column was operated with 90 kg/h of steam.  In a second distillation column K2, the bottom product withdrawn from column Kl was distilled so that 116.5 kg/h of 6-aminocapronitrile with a hexamethylenediamine content of 0.3% were withdrawn at the top.  58 kg/h with a 6-aminocapronitrile content of 2% were withdrawn at the bottom.  The top product of column K2 was distilled in a third column K3 so that 17 kg/h of vapor were withdrawn at the top and recycled into column Kl. Column K2 was operated with 30 kg/h of steam.  99.5 kg/h of 6-aminocapronitrile with a hexamethylenediamine content of 45 ppm were withdrawn from column K3 at a side discharge.  Column K3 was operated with 5 kg/h of steam.  The steam consumption of columns Kl + K3 was 95 kg/h.<br>
Comparative Example<br>
In distillation column Kl according to the Example, 200 kg/h of a hydrogenation mixture containing 29% of hexamethylenediamine, 42% of 6-aminocapronitrile, 27% of adipodinitrile, 0.5% of low-boiling components and 1.5% of high-boiling components were separated off so that 1.5 kg/h containing essentially low-boiling components were withdrawn at the top.<br>
58 kg/h of hexamethylenediamine with a 6-aminocapronitrile content of 115 ppm were withdrawn at a side discharge. 156.5 kg/h with a hexamethylenediamine content of 0.05% were withdrawn at the bottom of column Kl.  140 kg/h. of steam were necessary to obtain this hexamethylenediamine content at the bottom of the column.  In a second distillation column K2, the bottom product withdrawn from column Kl was distilled so that 116.5 kg/h of 6-aminocapronitrile were withdrawn at the top.  The hexamethylenediamine content of the top discharge was 800 ppm. The column was operated with 30 kg/h of steam.<br><br>
Respite the fact that the energy consumption of column Kl in the :omparative Example (140 kg/h) was higher than the sum of the 5nergy consumptions in columns Kl and K3 in the Example (95 kg/h overall), the ACN purity achieved was markedly poorer in the Comparative Example.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
