In still another embodiment of the present invention the bridge system has load bearing capacity of up to 70 tons.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the mounting assembly (9) is a structural member fabricated out of steel plate, preferably High Strength Low Alloy steel (HSLA), to bear and transfer load of mechanical handling device (6) onto chassis (9b) of the carrier vehicle (5).<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the carrier vehicle (5) is preferably TATRA vehicle, wherein the chassis is extended in length to about 0.85 m to form the mounting assembly (9) for mechanical handling device (6).<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the mechanical handling device (6) lifts the bridge system and is operated manually for deployment.<br>
The present invention is in relation to a method of operation for deployment of bridge system comprises acts of: spreading outriggers (5a) of carrier vehicle (5), positioning<br>
crane lock (8) to lock with lifting beam (6a) of mechanical handling device (6) for lifting the bridge system, and placing the bridge system onto gap for deployment.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the outriggers (5a) supports carrier vehicle (5) during deployment of the bridge system.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the mechanical handling device (6) lifts the bridge system and is operated manually for the deployment.<br>
The present invention is in relation to a method of assembling bridging system comprises acts of: mounting bridge system onto carrier vehicle (5), and installing mechanical handling device (6) onto mounting assembly (9) of the carrier vehicle (5) for deployment of the bridging system.<br>
The bridging system is of 5m short span consists of a Tatra 6x6 chassis as a carrier vehicle (5), over which two numbers of 5m long bridge superstructure in RDE-40 aluminium alloy / steel are stacked one above the other (figure 4). An articulation type mechanical handling device (6) to handle the bridges during deployment is also mounted at the rear of the vehicle. During transportation, the mechanical handling device (6) will be folded towards the side of the system.<br>
The bridge superstructure as shown in figure 1 (a) and (b), is 5m long and 4m wide and is designed for MLC-70 load. Bridge superstructure comprises of main deck (1) at top with supporting cross girder (3) and channel (3a). The bridges are folded at side ends using folding decks (4) along with longitudinal girders (2). The bridge is designed in light weight aluminum alloy RDE-40 and it is a fully decked. The width of the bridge is 3.5 m in transportation mode and 4m in deployed condition. The change in width is achieved by two folding decks (4). Provision for self illuminating beta lights is provided on the bridge superstructure for night operation. Total weight of the bridge achieved is 1.6 tons.<br>
The density of aluminum is one-third that of steel. The strength to weight ratio of aluminum is higher than that of steel. The bridges with light weight are of primary consideration, as they are required to be mechanically launched within a very small time<br>
frame. Hence, the bridge is designed in aluminum alloy RDE-40. The bridge is laid in very harsh environmental conditions and hence the material aluminum is chosen because of its corrosion resistance properties.<br>
RDE-40 is a special type of aluminum alloy with zinc and magnesium as its primary alloying elements, whereas the zinc contributes to strength factor, magnesium and other elements in order to increase the corrosion resistance of the metal.<br>
The numerical value 40 stands for the ultimate tensile strength of the alloy i.e. 40 kg/mm2.The chemical and mechanical properties of the alloy are given below.<br>
Chemical properties:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The width of the bridge in transportation mode is 3.5 m and in deployed condition it is 4.0 m. This is achieved with the help of two folding decks (4) which are manually operated. The folding deck (4) is hinged to the main deck (1) at four points on either side as shown in figure 2 (c). Figure 2(a) and 2(b) illustrates the front and side view of the bridging system. Since, the bridge is manufactured in light weight aluminum; these folding decks (4) are easily lifted by two persons and are opened out after deployment of the bridge.<br>
In any areas of urgency where gaps of 4.5 m or below is encountered, this bridge can be laid down within a matter of minutes. This bridge also laid down in marshy areas or used<br>
as in ramp mode for high bank crossing.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates that vehicle chassis (9b) has been modified to mount the mechanical handling device (6) at rear end of the vehicle. The mounting assembly (9) basically consists of chassis extension (9c) and top beam (9a). It is a structural member fabricated out of HSLA steel plate to bear and transfer the loads of handling device on to the chassis.<br>
The scope of the development of 5 m bridging system includes development of fully decked, light weight aluminum bridges of 5 m length and 4 m total roadway width in deployed condition. The top of the deck have anti-skid surface. The bridges have self illuminating lights mounted on it for night visibility. The bridges have a load classification of MLC-70. Two such bridges are mounted one above the other on a TATRA 6x 6 vehicle as shown in figure 4 (a) and 4 (b). The bridges are mechanically launched with the help of a suitable mechanical handling device (6) mounted on the vehicle itself as shown in figure 3.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates the eccentric loading condition on the bridge system, in order to find out the loading condition on the bridge, eccentric loading condition has been taken. Under this condition one track is at the edge of the bridge and the load distribution factors are obtained.<br>
In this system, the mechanical handling device (6) is a vehicle mounted hydraulically operated crane of 15.5 ton-m. As it is mounted on vehicle, the main restriction was that the height is limited to specified limit of overall height, width and length during road and rail transportability.<br>
Specifications of Mechanical Handling Device:<br>
Mechanical handling Device (6) has engineered for the short span bridge application. Hydraulic system for Mechanical handling Device (6) has a wireless remote control with digital display of all load parameters. Power for the operation of mechanical handling device (6) is tapped from vehicle. In order to handle emergency situation, in case of<br>
power failure, separate stand-by system is made available for non interrupted use of the system<br>
