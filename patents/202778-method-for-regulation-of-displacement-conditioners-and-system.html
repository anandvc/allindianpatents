				<td>METHOD FOR REGULATION OF DISPLACEMENT CONDITIONERS, AND SYSTEM<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of cooling of objects by means of displacement ventilation.<br>
According to the so-called technique of "displacement", in itself laiown, in a room a flow of cold air is supplicd at low speed at floor level.<br>
The conditioner or re&amp;igerator which supplies this flow can be outside or inside the room. The culd air, denser, is spread over tlic entire floor. Wlien the cold air comes into contact with the heat sources in the room, for example equipment to be cooled, it heats and an ascending movement is generated by convection. The heated air near the ceiling of the room is aspirated by the conditioner, cooled and returned mto circulation. The features which distinguish displacement ventilation are the low speed of the air, for which some books define the upper limit of 0.5 m/s, and the fact that the cooling ah, that is to say the ah emitted by the conditioner, which air passes along the heat sources to be cooled and returns to the conditioner, is not mixed with the ambient air, or only mixes with it minimally.<br>
Cooling of the displacement air can be carried out both with air diffusers placed mside the room to be cooled; cormected to air conditioners placed externally via a networlc of ducts, or directly with air conditioners placed inside the room.<br>
The movement of coohng air in a displacement system is caused by the thermal gradient between the cold cooling air at floor level and the heated coohng air at ceiling level It is therefore decisive to maintain this thermal gradient close to the design value or above a preset limit for proper working of the system.<br>
An object of the invention is to maintain the gradient always above a certain hmit value.<br>
The thermal gradient is linlced to the air flow rate and to the heal load of the room. At the same air flow rate, the gradient is greater if the! heat load is greater. At the same heat load, the gradient is greater if the air flow rate is lower.<br><br>
The heat load of a room depends on the endogenous heat emitted by the equipment located in the room, on the endogenous heat emitted by the persons, In the mom, and on the heat exchanged via the structures (walls, floor, ceiling) between the room and the outside.<br>
The heat load varies in time substantially because both the endogenous heat emitted by the equipment and by the persons and the heat exchanged, wliich depends on the conditions inside and outside the room, vary.<br>
According tÂ» the state of art prior to this invention, in systems with displacement cooling regulation takes place by controlling the power supplied by the conditioner. The traditional system however does not succeed in preventing variations in the temperature gradient completely and, when the temperature gradient decre^es excessively, this prevents proper fimctioning of the displacement system.<br>
To avoid the problems mentioned, provision is made for the regulation method according to the invention, as claimed in claim 1 and the system as claimed in claim 7. "Further new and useful features are claimed in the dependent claims. The method of regulation, ui other words, provides for joint and sequential regulation of the power suppHed by the conditioner and of the air flow rate of the conditioner. The regulation can be of the modulating type both for the air flow rate and for the power. Or modulating regulation of the power and regulation by discrete steps for the air flow rate can be provided. Or regulation by discrete" steps of the air flow rate and of the power can be provided. Or finally modulating regulation of the air flow rate and discrete step regulation of the power can be provided.<br>
The new regulation method achieves the objects stated above and remedies the disadvantages described above relating to the state of the art. In particular it maintains the temperature gradient always equal or very close to the design value. Moreover there is an advantage as regai-ds the electricity consumption of the fans, in that the power that they must supply decreases strongly as the ambient temperature decreases.<br>

The object of this patent application is a method of regulation of conditioners for a room, functioning according to the displacement principle or the like, and hence a regulation method which allows constant maintaining, in the room to be conditioned, of a design temperature gradient or higher than the design gradient, irrespective of the power required by the same room, According to the new method combined regulation is carried out of the power suppUed by the conditioner and of the air flow rate of the conditioner. The air flow rate can be varied by varying the number of re-\"s of the fan or by using air locks, or in another manner.<br>
According to the new method, more paiticularly, a variation in the air temperature is measured, indicating the variation in the load required (ol" the powci- rcqnired) by tiic system, by means of sensors placed inside or outside the conditioner. Tiie temperature measured can be that of the delivery air, or of the return air, or both. As a function of the<br><br>
Ihis/these tempcraLurc/s measured the air flow rate and power are regulated, so as to maintain the gradient substantially at the preset value.<br>
The combined regiikiiitii) ofthe iiir Mow ra(c and of tlic powci" can he carried oiii in various ways.<br>
Figures 1-4 refer to a first embodiment of the invention, whereby "modulating" regulation is carried out both of the air ilow rate and of the power. In tliis text the term "modulating" refers to a variation of the parameter controlled (power and/or flow rate) with continuous functioning, without any discontinuity. In the first embodiment, al 100% of the power required by the system, both the power supplied by the conditioner and the air flow rate are 100% (design data). As the load or power required by the system decreases, both arc reduced, according to any trend. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate a linear variation. Provision is made for the air flow rate not to drop below a minimum value so as to improve the sensitivity of the temperature sensors and/or for rnoving in any case the air in the room. In practice regulation of the air flow rate and of the power is carried out as a consequence of the air temperatures measured, as shown in Fig. 2, rather than as a consequence of the measurement of the load required, the temperatures being indicative of this load. The regulation of both parameters (power of the conditioner and air flow rate) takes place within a certain regulation range, defined by vertical dashed lines in Fig. 2. The widtli of the regulation range is iiTelevant and only depends on the control precision to be obtained. Widiin this range the regulation method described above is apphed.<br>
With the regulation method described above, the temperature gradient is maintained constant and equal to 100% (design value), while widi die traditional regulation method, based on regulation of the power of the conditioner alone, the gradient decreased even as far as values such as to prevent proper functioning of the system according to the displacement principle. Moreover a significant advantage is obtained as regards electricity consumption of the fans, as shown in Fig. 4, in the case of variation of the flow rate taking place by modifying the revs of the fan itself That is to say, whereas with the traditional regulation method the consumption of the fans was always equal to 100%, according to the variation in tiic ambicnl lempcraliire, with tlic melhoci of regulalioii shown in Figs. 1 and 2 there is a considerable reduction in the coiLsumption of the fan/s, to a different extent for alternating current fans and for direct cun"ent fans.<br><br>
A second embodiment of the invention is illustrated with reference to Figures 5-8. M 100% of the power required by the syslcm both the power supplied by the conditioner and tiie air flow rate arc equal to 100% (design data). The regulation is carried out by varying, by discrete steps (any number of steps) the air flow rate, and contiotiously, with any trend (modulating variation), the power supplied by the coziditioiier, as the power required by the system varies, or rather as tiie temperature of the air measured varies. The air flow rate can also be maintained at a minimum value, in the case of minimum power required by the system, to improve the sensitivity of the temperature sensors and/or move in any case the am in the room. In Figure 6 two vertical dashed Unes define the range of regulation; the weight of the range of regulation is irrelevant and depends on the control precision to be obtained. The temperature values, at which the various steps of the air flow rate are activated, can vary, provided the temperature gradient is gi-eater than the minimum allowed for proper functioning of displacement.<br>
The advantages of the second embodiment arc similai" to those of the lirsl maimer, in particular, as can be seen in Fig, 7, the gradient is always m^iintained above the lower threshold for proper fimctioning of displacement. Moreover, as shovra in Figure 8, in the case of the flow rate variation taking place by variation of the revs of the fan, the consumption of the fan/fans decreases as the temperature of the ambient air decreases (therefore of the power required by the system). The reduction is different according to whether the fans are supplied with alternating current or with direct current.<br>
In a third embodiment of the invention regulation by discrete steps is carried out both of the air flow rate and of the power. The embodiment is illustrated in Figs. 9-12.<br>
The stepped regulation of the power is in actual fact a regulation of energy. In practice the conditioner is achiated and de-actuated but nevertheless, when actuated, always supplies 100% of the power. For example, to obtain 50% of the energy, actuation talces place for 30 minutes and de-actuation for a further 30 minutes.<br>
In the case of one single regulation step, Fig. 9a, when the compressor is in function, it always supplies 100%i of the power. The air flow rate is equal to a fraction of the maximum, until the power required by the system approaches the maximum design power (or even exceeds it). In this case the air f!o\V rate rises to the design maximum.<br><br>
In the cuKc of Fig. 9b, the power supplied by the conditioner is regulated in order Vo ibrni two steps. The air flow rate increases by discrete steps for values of power required by the .system which can vary as a ftmction of the percentage of regulation of the power supplied bythe conditioner.<br>
A.S lor Die previous cases, in actual iacl regulation is performed on the basis of llie temperature of the air (deliver)", return or both) read by the sensors, as can be seen in the graph in Fig. 10. Within the range of regulation the air flow rate decreases by discrete steps. The width of the range of regulation is irrelevant and only depends on the control precision to be obtained. The temperature values at which the various steps of the air flow rate are activated can vary. The steps can be activated for lower values at the minimum temperature of tire range of regulation and deactivated also for values higher than the maximum temperature of the range of regulation.<br>
The advantages are in particular, as mentioned in relation to the other embodiments, that the regulation method maintains the temperature gradient always above an established threshold value, aiid allows a considerable reduction in the consumption of the fans as the ambient temperature decreases, compared to the traditional regulation system. The reduction is more noticeable for fans supplied with direct current.<br>
According to a fourth embodiment, modulating regulation of the air flow rate and regulation by discrete steps of the power are carried out, as illustrated in Fig. 13, as a function of the power required by the system and in Fig. 14 as a function of the temperattu-e of the air-(delivery, retum/Mnbient or both). Within the range of regulation, defined by the vertical dashed lines, the air flow rate decreases continuously with any trend as the temperature decreases, and the power supplied by the conditioner decreases by steps. the advantages are as mentioned with reference to the previous embodiments.<br><br><br>
