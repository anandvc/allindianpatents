				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
MULTILAYER MICROPOROUS MEMBRANE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a<br>
microporous membrane having a superior permeability.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to a<br>
microporous membrane suitable for removal of minute<br>
substances such as viruses, from a solution containing<br>
physiologically active substances such as proteins.<br>
Background Art<br>
Recently, problems with pathogens such as<br>
viruses and pathogenic proteins, which may possibly<br>
exist as contaminants in a solution for injection, have<br>
been highlighted as a critical situation. This is<br>
especially true when a liquid preparation containing a<br>
physiologically active substance such as plasma<br>
derivatives, biopharmaceuticals or plasma for<br>
transfusion is administered into a human body. A<br>
method for removing or inactivating such pathogens is<br>
required.<br>
Methods for inactivating viruses include<br>
heating processes and treatments using chemical agents<br>
(for example solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment).<br>
However, these methods are limited in their<br>
inactivation effects depending on types of viruses<br>
For example, a heating process is less effective for<br>
thermostable viruses such as hepatitis A virus.<br>
Further, an S/D treatment has virtually no effect on<br>
viruses such as parvovirus which have no lipid<br>
membrane. In a treatment using chemical agents, since<br>
there is a possibility that the chemical agent used may<br>
be administered into a human body, a process for<br>
removing the chemical agent may be required.<br>
Membrane filtration is known as a method for<br>
physically removing viruses. Since a procedure for<br>
separation is performed using a membrane filtration<br>
system which is dependent on a size of virus particles,<br>
it is effective for all viruses regardless of chemical<br>
or thermal natures of viruses.<br>
A type of virus ranges from the smallest<br>
viruses such as parvovirus having a diameter of about<br>
18 - 24 nm or poliovirus having a diameter of about 25<br>
- 30 nm to a relatively large virus such as HIV having<br>
a diameter of 80 - 100 nm. In order to remove such<br>
groups of viruses by physical means using the membrane<br>
filtration, a microporous membrane having a maximum<br>
pore diameter of 100 nm or less is required. The need<br>
for a system for removing small viruses such as<br>
parvovirus has been increased recently.<br>
Virus removal membranes which can be used for<br>
purification of plasma derivatives and<br>
biopharmaceuticals by removing viruses, must have not<br>
only viral removal ability but also a high permeability<br>
for physiologically active substances such as albumin<br>
and globulin. For such purposes, ultrafiltration<br>
membranes having a pore diameter of several nm and<br>
reverse osmotic membranes having a smaller size of pore<br>
diameter are not suitable as a virus removal membrane.<br>
Even if microporous membranes have a pore<br>
diameter suitable for the viral removal, the<br>
microporous membranes, such as an ultrafiltration<br>
membrane, having large voids inside the membrane and<br>
carrying appropriate filtration characteristics in a<br>
surface skin layer, have a low reliability for viral<br>
removal. The reason is that there are always<br>
significant deficiencies such as pinholes or cracks in<br>
the skin layer and large voids inside the membrane.<br>
The skin layer herein means an extremely thin layer<br>
existing on one side or both sides of the membrane, and<br>
having a denser structure as compared with an inner<br>
region of the membrane.<br>
A membrane constructed with a gradient<br>
structure with continuously increasing pore diameter<br>
from one side of the membrane surface to the other is<br>
not suitable for viral removal. In order to perform<br>
the viral removal completely, the membrane must have a<br>
structure in which a homogeneous structural region<br>
having no large internal void as well as having<br>
extremely few or almost no continuous change in a pore<br>
diameter along a thickness direction, is present with a<br>
certain thickness. In such a structure, a mechanism of<br>
filtration generally called "depth filtration" is<br>
generated. As a result, a highly reliable viral<br>
removal capability can be obtained as a sum of the<br>
viral removal in each minute region of a membrane<br>
thickness.<br>
During a final process of manufacturing, a<br>
microporous membrane to be used for the viral removal<br>
is treated with some sterilization treatment in order<br>
to guarantee safety of the product. Sterilization<br>
procedures used include: a method using chemical<br>
agents, a method using ultraviolet irradiation or ?-ray<br>
irradiation, a method using steam sterilization and the<br>
like. Use of chemical agents may exert harmful effects<br>
on a human body caused by residual trace chemical<br>
agents remaining in a microporous membrane. A<br>
sterilization method using ultraviolet irradiation is<br>
not suitable for sterilization in the final process due<br>
to a low transmissivity of ultraviolet rays. A<br>
sterilization method using ?-ray irradiation is<br>
unreliable due to irradiation damage caused in a<br>
microporous membrane. It seems that use of steam is<br>
the most secure, reliable and preferable method. In<br>
this case, materials used in a microporous membrane are<br>
required to have a thermal stability, since the<br>
membrane should be treated by the steam sterilization<br>
at high temperature.<br>
In order to prevent adsorption of protein, a<br>
component of a preparation, to a microporous membrane.<br>
the membrane should preferably be hydrophilic.<br>
Consequently, it is preferable to use membrane<br>
materials that are originally hydrophilic or to<br>
introduce hydrophilic nature into the membrane by a<br>
post-treatment. However, when hydrophilic materials<br>
are used, there is a possibility of remarkable<br>
deterioration in mechanical properties of the membrane<br>
due to swelling of the membrane with water.<br>
Consequently, it is preferable to prepare a hydrophilic<br>
microporous membrane firstly by constructing a physical<br>
structure of the membrane with hydrophobic materials,<br>
and thereafter hydrophilizing the surface of micropore<br>
of the constructed membrane.<br>
In a case of industrial production of plasma<br>
derivatives and biopharmaceuticals, it is preferable to<br>
use a membrane having a high permeation rate for a<br>
solution containing physiologically active substances<br>
in order to increase productivity. However, a solution<br>
containing physiologically active substances such as<br>
globulin contains large amounts of suspended substances<br>
as polymers such as dimers or more. These suspended<br>
substances cause clogging of pores of a microporous<br>
membrane. As a result, filtration rate is rapidly<br>
decreased. The smaller the size of the micropore<br>
diameter, the more this tendency is significantly<br>
increased. As a result, filtration resistance is<br>
sometimes rapidly increased due to an accumulation of<br>
the suspended materials on a membrane surface. In<br>
order to reduce the inconvenience, a pre-filter with<br>
larger pore diameter is conventionally used to remove<br>
the suspended substances. However, it is difficult to<br>
remove the suspended substances completely by using a<br>
pre-fliter. In addition, since use of two types of<br>
filters results in an increased cost, a membrane which<br>
does not result in clogging in the presence of the<br>
suspended substances, is eagerly demanded.<br>
JP-A-7-265674 discloses a polyvinylidene<br>
fluoride membrane which can be used for the viral<br>
removal from a solution, and a term "isotropic" is used<br>
in the claims thereof. However, the "isotropic"<br>
membrane often had a problem of drastic decrease in<br>
treatment amount due to clogging or accumulation of the<br>
suspended substances onto a membrane surface, because a<br>
liquid for which the microporous membrane is used for<br>
the purpose of viral removal generally contains<br>
physiologically active substances and thus a variety of<br>
suspended substances.<br>
WO 99/47593 discloses a polyvinylidene<br>
fluoride membrane which has a surface layer with<br>
improved open pore ratio by using a specified cooling<br>
medium, and describes that said surface layer can have<br>
a pre-filtering function. However, the thickness of<br>
said surface layer is not greater than 3 Âµm, resulting<br>
in the problem of not exhibiting a sufficient pre-<br>
filtering effect during filtration of a liquid<br>
containing a variety of suspended substances such as<br>
protein solutions.<br>
JP-A-7-173323 discloses a polyvinylidene<br>
fluoride microporous membrane manufactured by making a<br>
difference between cooling rates at both membrane<br>
surfaces from each other in a cooling process. Under<br>
this condition, a pore diameter at the surface cooled<br>
at slower rates becomes larger, and thus providing a<br>
difference between pore diameters on each surface of<br>
the membrane. A pore diameter ratio of both membrane<br>
surfaces is specified as 4 -10 in the claims of said<br>
publication. In the method according to said<br>
publication, cooling speed varies continuously along a<br>
membrane thickness direction, providing a continuous<br>
change in a membrane structure along a membrane<br>
thickness direction, and further a noticeable gradient<br>
structure having a pore diameter difference of over<br>
four times between both membrane surfaces. In such a<br>
manufacturing method, a fine structure layer which has<br>
a highly accurate homogeneity to realize a depth<br>
filtration required for the viral removal, cannot be<br>
obtained.<br>
WO 91/16968 discloses, as a polyvinylidene<br>
fluoride membrane to be used for the viral removal from<br>
a solution, a microporous membrane comprising a<br>
supporting body, a surface skin and an intermediate<br>
porous region present between the supporting body and<br>
the skin, produced by coating and coagulating a polymer<br>
solution on the supporting body having pores and thus<br>
forming the skin layer and the intermediate porous<br>
layer onto said supporting body. However, said<br>
microporous membrane does not have a one-piece<br>
structure nor a fine structure layer of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>

provide a microporous membrane with a superior<br>
permeability. Further object of the present invention<br>
is to provide a microporous membrane to exhibit a<br>
performance sufficient to remove viruses and the like<br>
and have a superior permeability for physiologically<br>

above described problems, the present: inventors found<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Shape of the microporous membrane of the<br>
present invention is a flat membrane type, a hollow<br>
fiber type and the like and any shape thereof is<br>
applicable, but a hollow fiber is preferable in view of<br>
easiness of manufacturing.<br>
Thickness of the multilayer microporous<br>
membrane of the present invention is preferably 15 -<br>
1,000 Âµm, more preferably 15 - 500 pun and most<br>
preferably 20 - 100 Âµm. A membrane thickness thinner<br>
than 15 pun is not preferable due to a tendency to<br>
exhibit an insufficient strength of the microporous<br>
membrane. A membrane thickness above 1,000 Âµm is also<br>
not preferable due to a tendency to exhibit an<br>
insufficient permeation performance.<br>
It is essential for the microporous membrane<br>
of the present invention to have a coarse structure<br>
layer with a higher open pore ratio and a fine<br>
structure layer with a lower open pore ratio, as well<br>
as a multilayer structure wherein said coarse structure<br>
layer is present at least in one surface of the<br>
membrane. Said coarse structure layer is a portion<br>
having a relatively high open pore ratio in the whole<br>
membrane thickness, and enhances membrane processing<br>
ability by providing a pre-filtering function for<br>
suspended substances contained in a protein solution<br>
and the like. In addition, said fine structure layer<br>
is a portion having a relatively low open pore ratio in<br>
the whole membrane thickness, which substantially<br>
specifies the pore diameter of the membrane. In a<br>
microporous membrane intended for the purpose of<br>
removing minute particles such as viruses, this portion<br>
is a layer whose function is to entrap said minute<br>
particles.<br>
Porosity and open pore ratio in the present<br>
invention are the same in fundamental concept, both<br>
corresponding to a volume ratio of void parts in a<br>
microporous membrane. However, the former is a value<br>
obtained from an apparent volume calculated based on a<br>
cross-sectional area and a length of membrane, a weight<br>
of said membrane and a true density of a membrane<br>
material itself, whereas the latter is a ratio of an<br>
area occupied by void parts to a cross-sectional area<br>
of a membrane, obtained by an image analysis of a<br>
photograph by electron microscope of a cross-section of<br>
the membrane. In the present invention, the latter is<br>
measured for each specified thickness along a thickness<br>
direction of the membrane, and is used to examine a<br>
variation in a volume ratio of void parts along a<br>
thickness direction of the membrane. The open pore<br>
ratio is measured for every 1 Âµm thickness in view of<br>
measurement accuracy for a membrane with the maximum<br>
pore diameter not more than 300 nm.<br>
More specifically, open pore ratio was<br>
obtained by dividing an observed cross-sectional<br>
structure along a perpendicular direction against a<br>
membrane surface of the microporous membrane into<br>
regions with a 1 Âµm thickness each along a thickness<br>
direction, and then calculating a fraction of area<br>
occupied by voids in each divided region by an image<br>
analysis. An average open pore ratio is obtained by<br>
averaging an open pore ratio of each divided region for<br>
a certain range of membrane thickness, and average open<br>
pore ratio for the whole membrane thickness is obtained<br>
by averaging an open pore ratio obtained for each<br>
divided region for the whole membrane thickness.<br>
Porosity of a microporous membrane of the<br>
present invention is preferably 30 - 90%, more<br>
preferably 40 - 85% and most preferably 50 - 80%. A<br>
porosity less than 30% is not preferable due to an<br>
insufficient filtration rate and a porosity above 90%<br>
i is also not preferable due to not only loss of<br>
reliability in the removal of viruses and the like but<br>
also an insufficient strength of a microporous<br>
membrane.<br>
Thickness of a coarse structure layer of the<br>
present invention is not less than 5.0 Âµm. A thickness<br>
of a coarse structure layer not less than 5.0 Âµm can<br>
exhibit a sufficient pre-filtering function. Thickness<br>
of a coarse structure layer is preferably not less than<br>
7.0 Âµm and more preferably not less than 10.0 Âµm. In<br>
addition, a thickness of a fine structure layer<br>
occupies not less than 50% of the whole membrane<br>
thickness. A membrane with a thickness of fine<br>
structure layer not less than 50% of the whole membrane<br>
thickness can be used without lowering an removal<br>
performance for viruses and the like. It is preferably<br>
not less than 55% and more preferably not less than<br>
60%.<br>
Coarse structure layer in the present<br>
invention is a layer which is present adjacent to a<br>
membrane surface and has a higher open pore ratio<br>
measured along a thickness direction, and is a layer<br>
which has an open pore ratio (A) preferably not less<br>
than an average open pore ratio of the whole membrane<br>
thickness +2.0% [hereafter referred to as a coarse<br>
structure layer (A)], more preferably + 2.5% and most<br>
preferably +3.0%. An upper limit of open pore ratio<br>
of a coarse structure layer is preferably not more than<br>
an average open pore ratio of the whole membrane<br>
thickness + 30%, more preferably not more than an<br>
average open pore ratio of the whole membrane thickness<br>
+ 25% and most preferably not more than an average open<br>
pore ratio of the whole membrane thickness + 20%. An<br>
open pore ratio of a coarse structure layer not less<br>
than an average open pore ratio of the whole membrane<br>
thickness + 2.0% provides a sufficiently large<br>
structural difference from a fine structure layer, and<br>
can exhibit pre-filtering effects and enhance<br>
processing ability of microporous membrane. To the<br>
contrary, an open pore ratio of a coarse structure<br>
layer more than an average open pore ratio of the whole<br>
membrane thickness + 30% is not preferable due to a<br>
coarser structure of the coarse structure layer than<br>
required and an insufficient pre-filtering function.<br>
Coarse structure layer in the present<br>
invention has preferably a gradient structure with an<br>
open pore ratio continuously decreasing from a membrane<br>
surface toward a fine structure layer. As a reason for<br>
this preference, it is supposed that continuous<br>
decrease in a pore diameter together with continuous<br>
decrease in an open pore ratio allows removal of larger<br>
suspended substances at the vicinity of the surface as<br>
well as removal of smaller suspended substances at more<br>
inner zone stepwisely, thus enhancing a pre-filtering<br>
function of a coarse structure layer. A discontinuous<br>
remarkable change in an open pore ratio at a boundary<br>
between a coarse structure layer and a fine structure<br>
layer is not preferable due to a decrease in filtering<br>
rate by an accumulation of suspended substances at the<br>
vicinity of the boundary. A gradient structure<br>
described herein with continuous decrease in an open<br>
pore ratio means a general tendency along a membrane<br>
thickness direction, and thus more or less a local<br>
inversion in an open pore ratio caused by structural<br>
inconsistency or measurement error may be present.<br>
Coarse structure layer in the present<br>
invention preferably comprises a layer with an open<br>
pore ratio not less than an average open pore ratio of<br>
the whole membrane thickness + 5.0%, more preferably<br>
comprises a layer with an open pore ratio not less than<br>
an average open pore ratio of the whole membrane<br>
thickness +8.0%. A coarse structure layer comprising<br>
a layer with an open pore ratio not less than an<br>
average open pore ratio of the whole membrane thickness<br>
+ 5.0% means to have a layer with a sufficiently larger<br>
pore diameter than a fine structure layer, allowing the<br>
coarse structure layer to exhibit a sufficient pre-<br>
filtering function. A layer with the maximum open pore<br>
ratio is preferably present at the membrane surface or<br>
at the vicinity thereof.<br>
When the microporous membrane of the present<br>
invention is used for viral removal in a liquid, it is<br>
preferable that a skin layer is not present in the<br>
surface of said microporous membrane and the maximum<br>
pore diameter determined by the bubble point method is<br>
preferably not less than 10 nm, more preferably not<br>
less than 15 nm in view of a permeability of<br>
physiologically active substances such as globulin or a<br>
filtration rate. Presence of a skin layer may cause<br>
abrupt lowering of permeability due to an accumulation<br>
of suspended substances contained in a protein solution<br>
and the like on a surface. Skin layer herein means a<br>
layer which is present adjacent to a membrane surface<br>
and has a smaller pore diameter than in an inner region<br>
of membrane, and a thickness thereof is not more than 1<br>
Âµm in general. Further, an upper limit of the maximum<br>
pore diameter determined by the bubble point method<br>
depends on the size of a target for removal such as<br>
viruses. However, it is preferably not more than 100<br>
nm, more preferably not more than 70 nm and preferably<br>
not more than 50 nm in a particular case for removing<br>
small viruses. The maximum pore diameter herein is a<br>
value measured by the bubble point method in accordance<br>
with ASTM F316-86.<br>
In said microporous membrane, an average pore<br>
diameter in the membrane surface, where a coarse<br>
structure layer is present adjacent thereto, is<br>
preferably at least two times of the maximum pore<br>
diameter determined by the bubble point method, more<br>
preferably at least three times of the maximum pore<br>
diameter determined by the bubble point method. An<br>
average pore diameter in the membrane surface, where a<br>
coarse structure layer is present adjacent thereto,<br>
less than two times of the maximum pore diameter<br>
determined by the bubble point method is not<br>
preferable, because the pore diameter is too small to<br>
prevent an accumulation of suspended substances on the<br>
surface and a decrease in filtration rate. When said<br>
microporous membrane is used for viral removal, an<br>
average pore diameter in a membrane surface, where a<br>
coarse structure layer is present adjacent thereto, is<br>
preferably not more than 3 Âµm, more preferably not more<br>
than 2 Âµm. Said average pore diameter over 3 Âµm is not<br>
preferable due to a tendency to lower a pre-filtering<br>
function.<br>
In the present invention, fine structure<br>
layer is a layer with a lower open pore ratio, and is<br>
preferably a layer which has an open pore ratio (B)<br>
less than an average open pore ratio of the whole<br>
membrane thickness + 2.0% and in the range of [an<br>
average value of an open pore ratio of a layer having<br>
an open pore ratio less than an average open pore ratio<br>
of the whole membrane thickness + 2.0%] Â± 2.0%<br>
(inclusive of both limits) [hereafter referred to as a<br>
fine structure layer (B)]. An open pore ratio of a<br>
fine structure layer in the range [an average value of<br>
an open pore ratio of a layer having an open pore ratio<br>
less than an average open pore ratio of the whole<br>
membrane thickness + 2.0%] Â± 2.0% (inclusive of both<br>
limits) means that a fine structure layer has a<br>
relatively homogeneous structure, which is important in<br>
removing viruses and the like by depth filtration.<br>
Higher homogeneity of a fine structure layer is more<br>
preferable, and variation range of an open pore ratio<br>
is preferably Â± 2%, and more preferably Â± 1%.<br>
Preferable example of a fine structure layer is the<br>
intra-spherulitic void structure disclosed in WO<br>
01/28667, and the like.<br>
Another structural characteristic required<br>
for depth filtration is a number of filtration steps,<br>
which corresponds to a thickness of a fine structure<br>
layer in the present invention. A thickness of a fine<br>
structure layer is essentially not less than 50%, more<br>
preferably not less than 55%, and further more<br>
preferably not less than 60% of the whole membrane<br>
thickness. A thickness of a fine structure layer less<br>
than 50% of the whole membrane thickness is not<br>
preferable because the thickness may lower an removing<br>
performance for viruses, although it depends on<br>
membrane thickness.<br>
In the microporous membrane of the present<br>
invention, an intermediate region may be present, which<br>
does not belong to either said coarse structure layer<br>
(A) or said fine structure layer (B). An intermediate<br>
region herein is a layer with an open pore ratio less<br>
than an average open pore ratio of the whole membrane +<br>
2.0% but out of the range of [an average value of an<br>
open pore ratio of a layer having an open pore ratio<br>
less than an average open pore ratio of the whole<br>
membrane thickness + 2.0%] Â± 2.0% (inclusive of both<br>
limits). Such a layer is generally present in a<br>
boundary part between a coarse structure layer (A) and<br>
a fine structure layer (B).<br>
Further, in the microporous membrane of the<br>
present invention, a coarse structure layer and a fine<br>
structure layer are essentially formed in one-piece.<br>
One-piece formation of a coarse structure layer and a<br>
fine structure layer herein means that a coarse<br>
structure layer and a fine structure layer are<br>
simultaneously formed in manufacturing of a microporous<br>
membrane. In this case, an intermediate region may be<br>
present in a boundary part of a coarse structure layer<br>
and a fine structure layer. Therefore, a membrane<br>
manufactured by coating a layer with a relatively small<br>
pore diameter onto a supporting body with a large pore<br>
diameter and a membrane manufactured by laminating<br>
various membranes with different pore diameters are not<br>
included in the multilayer microporous membrane of the<br>
present invention. Membranes manufactured by coating<br>
or laminating various membranes with different pore<br>
diameters have such drawbacks that suspended substances<br>
tend to accumulate between a supporting body and coated<br>
layers, because connection of pores is lowered or a<br>
pore diameter varies drastically and discontinuously<br>
between two layers.<br>
Water permeation rate of the microporous<br>
membrane of the present invention varies depending on<br>
pore diameter, but is preferably from 2 x 10-11 to 3 x<br>
10-8, more preferably from 5 x 10-11 to 1.5 x 10-8 and<br>
most preferably from 8 x 10-11 to 8.5 x 10-9. Said water<br>
permeation rate is a converted value to a rate for a<br>
membrane thickness of 25 Âµm in units of m3/m2/sec/Pa/25<br>
Âµm. A water permeation rate less than 2 x 10"11 is not<br>
preferable because a practical water permeation rate<br>
cannot be obtained as a separation membrane. Further,<br>
a water permeation rate over 3 x 10-8 cannot be<br>
practically obtained in consideration of maintaining<br>
strength of microporous membrane or reliability of<br>
viral removal.<br>
Tensile break strength of the microporous<br>
membrane of the present invention is preferably from 1<br>
x 106 to 1 x 108 N/m2, more preferably from 1.5 x 106 to<br>
8 x 107 N/m2 and most preferably from 2 x 106 to 5 x 107<br>
N/m2 at least in one axial direction. A tensile break<br>
strength below 1 x 106 N/m2 is not preferable because it<br>
tends to cause troubles in microporous membrane such as<br>
damages by bending, friction and foreign matters or a<br>
rupture by a pressure applied at filtration. To the<br>
contrary, a tensile break strength over 1 x 108 N/m2 has<br>
no particular problem, however, such strong microporous<br>
membrane is practically difficult to be manufactured.<br>
Tensile break elongation of the microporous<br>
membrane of the present invention is preferably from 10<br>
to 2,000%, more preferably from 20 to 1,500% and most<br>
preferably from 30 to 1,000% at least in one axial<br>
direction. A tensile break elongation below 10% is not<br>
preferable because it tends to cause troubles in the<br>
microporous membrane such as damages by bending.<br>
friction and foreign matters or a rupture by a pressure<br>
applied, at filtration. To the contrary, a tensile<br>
break elongation over 2,000% has no particular problem.<br>
However, such microporous membrane is practically<br>
difficult to be manufactured.<br>
The microporous membrane of the present<br>
invention contains thermoplastic resin and a ratio of<br>
said thermoplastic resing in the membrane is preferably<br>
not less than 50% by weight, more preferably not less<br>
than 70% by weight and most preferably not less than<br>
80% by weight based on the total resin amount. A ratio<br>
of a thermoplastic resin in a membrane less than 50% by<br>
weight based on the total resin amount is not<br>
preferable because it causes problems such as a<br>
decreased mechanical strength of membrane.<br>
Thermoplastic resins used to manufacture the<br>
microporous membrane of the present invention are<br>
crystalline thermoplastic resin used in conventional<br>
compression, extrusion, injection, inflation and blow<br>
moldings, and includes polyolefin resins such as<br>
polyethylene resin, polypropylene resin and poly(4-<br>
methyl-1-pentene) resin; polyester resins such as<br>
poly(ethylene terephthalate) resin, poly(butylene<br>
terephthalate) resin, poly(ethylene terenaphthalate)<br>
resin, poly(butylene naphthalate) resin and<br>
poly(cyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate) resin;<br>
polyamide resins such as nylon 6, nylon 66, nylon 610,<br>
nylon 612, nylon 11, nylon 12 and nylon 46;<br>
fluororesins such as polyvinylidene fluoride resin,<br>
ethylene/tetrafluoroethylene resin and<br>
poly(chlorotrifluoroethylene) resin; polyphenylene<br>
ether resins; polyacetal resins and the like.<br>
In addition, in view of a thermal resistance<br>
required for applying a steam sterilization, at least<br>
one kind of thermoplastic resins constituting the<br>
microporous membrane of the present invention is a<br>
thermoplastic resin having a crystal melting point<br>
preferably at 140 - 300Â°C, more preferably at 145 -<br>
250Â°C and most preferably at 150 - 200Â°C. Further, in<br>
order to attain a thermal resistance of a membrane<br>
itself in blending with a resin having a crystal<br>
melting point lower than 140Â°C, an amount of a<br>
thermoplastic resin having a crystal melting point at<br>
140 - 300Â°C is preferably not less than 50% by weight,<br>
more preferably not less than 70% by weight and further<br>
more preferably not less than 80% by weight based on<br>
the total resin amount.<br>
Blending at least one type of thermoplastic<br>
resin having a crystal melting point at 140 - 300Â°C can<br>
give a thermal resistance for a steam sterilization<br>
process suitably adopted in applications to a medical<br>
separation membrane or a high temperature filtration<br>
process required as an important performance in other<br>
industrial applications, to a microporous membrane. On<br>
the other hand, use of a thermoplastic resin having a<br>
crystal melting point over 300Â°C makes it difficult to<br>
homogeneously dissolve the resin and a plasticizer by<br>
heating in a manufacturing method of the present<br>
invention, and thus deteriorates processability.<br>
Among said thermoplastic resins,<br>
polyvinylidene fluoride resins are particularly<br>
preferable due to a good balance between thermal<br>
resistance and processability. Polyvinylidene fluoride<br>
resin described herein means a fluororesin containing a<br>
vinylidene fluoride unit in a basic backbone, and is a<br>
resin called, in general, as PVDF in abbreviation. As<br>
these polyvinylidene fluoride resins, a homopolymer of<br>
vinylidene fluoride (VDF) and copolymers of vinylidene<br>
fluoride (VDF) with one or two kinds of monomers<br>
selected from the monomer group of hexafluoropropylene<br>
(HFP), pentafluoropropylene (PFP), tetrafluoroethylene<br>
(TFE), chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE) and<br>
perfluoromethylvinyl ether (PFMVE) can be used. Said<br>
homopolymer can also be used by blending with said<br>
copolymer. In the present invention, use of a<br>
polyvinylidene fluoride resin containing 30 - 100% by<br>
weight of the homopolymer is preferable due to an<br>
improved crystallinity and a high strength of<br>
microporous membrane, and use of homopolymer alone is<br>
more preferable.<br>
The microporous membrane of the present<br>
invention may be hydrophilic or hydrophobic. However,<br>
for a filtration of a solution containing<br>
physiologically active substances such as proteins, a<br>
membrane surface or a micropore surface is preferably<br>
hydrophilic. Generally, a degree of hydrophilic nature<br>
can be evaluated by a contact angle. An average value<br>
of advancing contact angle and regressive contact angle<br>
at 25Â°C is preferably not more than 60 degrees, more<br>
preferably not more than 45 degrees and most preferably<br>
not more than 30 degrees. As a simple evaluation<br>
method, if water penetrates spontaneously into a pore<br>
when a microporous membrane is contacted with water,<br>
the microporous membrane can be judged as sufficiently<br>
hydrophilic.<br>
An average molecular weight of a<br>
thermoplastic resin used in the present invention is<br>
preferably 50,000 - 5,000,000, more preferably 100,000<br>
- 2,000,000 and most preferably 150,000 - 1,000,000.<br>
Said molecular weight means a weight average molecular<br>
weight obtained by a measurement by gel permeation<br>
chromatography (GPC). For a resin with a molecular<br>
weight above 1,000,000, since it is, in general,<br>
difficult to perform an accurate GPC measurement, a<br>
viscosity average molecular weight by a viscosity<br>
method can be adopted as an alternative. An average<br>
molecular weight smaller than 50,000 is not preferable<br>
due to a lower melt tension in a melt processing<br>
resulting in a poor processability or a lower<br>
mechanical strength of membrane. An average molecular<br>
weight larger than 5,000,000 is not preferable due to a<br>
difficulty in homogeneous melt mixing.<br>
A typical manufacturing method for a<br>
microporous membrane of the present invention will be<br>
described hereinbelow.<br>
A typical manufacturing method for the<br>
microporous membrane of the present invention comprises<br>
the following (a) - (c) steps:<br>
(a) a steps of forming a membrane by heating a<br>
composition comprising a thermoplastic resin and a<br>
plasticizer at a temperature not lower than crystal<br>
melting point of said thermoplastic resin to<br>
homogeneously dissolve them and then extruding said<br>
composition from a discharge opening;<br>
(b) a step of forming a coarse structure layer and a<br>
fine structure layer by contacting said membrane with a<br>
non-volatile liquid which has a partial solubility for<br>
said thermoplastic resin, to one surface of said<br>
membrane under a heated state at a temperature not<br>
lower than 100Â°C and cooling the other surface of said<br>
membrane, while said membrane is taken up at such a<br>
draw rate that a draft ratio defined below becomes not<br>
less than 1 and not higher than 12:<br>
Draft ratio = (draw rate of membrane)/(discharge rate<br>
of composition at discharge opening); and<br>
(c) a step of removing substantial portion of said<br>
plasticizer and said non-volatile liquid.<br>
Polymer concentration of a thermoplastic<br>
resin used in the present invention is preferably 20 -<br>
90% by weight, more preferably 30 - 80% by weight and<br>
most preferably 35 - 70% by weight in a composition<br>
containing a thermoplastic resin and a plasticizer. A<br>
polymer concentration lower than 20% by weight results<br>
in disadvantages such as lowered membrane forming<br>
property and insufficient mechanical strength.<br>
Further, as a virus removal membrane, a pore diameter<br>
of a microporous membrane obtained becomes too large<br>
resulting in an insufficient viral removal performance.<br>
A polymer concentration over 90% by weight makes a pore<br>
diameter as well as a porosity of a microporous<br>
membrane obtained too small, and thus lowers filtration<br>
rate to an impractical level.<br>
As a plasticizer used in the present<br>
invention, a non-volatile solvent is used which can<br>
form a homogeneous solution at a temperature not lower<br>
than crystal melting point of a resin in mixing with a<br>
thermoplastic resin in a composition to manufacture a<br>
microporous membrane. A non-volatile solvent mentioned<br>
herein is a solvent having a boiling point not lower<br>
than 250Â°C under the atmospheric pressure. Form of a<br>
plasticizer may be liquid or solid at around an ambient<br>
temperature of 20Â°C. In order to manufacture a membrane<br>
having a small pore diameter and a homogeneous fine<br>
structure layer to be used for viral removal, use of a<br>
so-called "solid-liquid phase separation" type of<br>
plasticizer is preferable such as a plasticizer having<br>
a thermally induced type solid-liquid phase separation<br>
point at a temperature not lower than the ambient<br>
temperature in cooling a homogeneous solution with a<br>
thermoplastic resin. Among them, although some<br>
plasticizers have a thermally induced liquid-liquid<br>
phase separation point at a temperature not lower than<br>
the ambient temperature in cooling a homogeneous<br>
solution with a thermoplastic resin, use of the liquid-<br>
liquid phase separation type of plasticizer generally<br>
tends to make a pore diameter of a microporous membrane<br>
obtained larger. A plasticizer herein may be used in<br>
single or as a mixture of a plurality of substances.<br>
Thermally induced solid-liquid phase<br>
separation point can be determined by measuring an<br>
exothermic peak temperature of said resin by a thermal<br>
analysis (DSC), using a sample prepared in advance by<br>
melt mixing a composition containing specified<br>
concentrations of a thermoplastic resin and a<br>
plasticizer. Further, a crystallization point of said<br>
resin can be determined similarly by a thermal analysis<br>
using a sample prepared in advance by melt mixing said<br>
resin.<br>
Plasticizers preferable in manufacturing a<br>
membrane having a small pore diameter and a homogeneous<br>
fine structure layer to be used for viral removal<br>
include those disclosed in WO 01/28667. That is, they<br>
are a plasticizer having a phase separation point<br>
depression constant a of a composition, defined below,<br>
of 0 - 40Â°C, preferably a plasticizer having the<br>
constant of 1 - 35Â°C and more preferably a plastisizer<br>
having the constant of 5 - 30Â°C. A phase separation<br>
point depression constant over 40Â°C is not preferable<br>
due to reduced uniformity of pore diameter or lower<br>
strength.<br>
a = 100 x (Tc0 - Tc) + (100 - C)<br>
[wherein, a is a phase separation point depression<br>
constant (Â°C), Tc0 is a crystallization point of a<br>
thermoplastic resin, Tc is a thermally induced solid-<br>
liquid phase separation point (Â°C) and C is a<br>
concentration of a thermoplastic resin in a composition<br>
(% by weight)].<br>
For example, when polyvinylidene fluoride<br>
resin is selected as a thermoplastic resin, a<br>
particularly preferable plsticizer is dicyclohexyl<br>
phtharate (DCHP), triphenyl phosphate (TPP),<br>
diphenylcresyl phosphate (CDP) and tricresyl phosphate<br>
(TCP).<br>
The first method for homogeneously dissolving<br>
a composition containing a thermoplastic resin and a<br>
plasticizer in the present invention comprises<br>
introducing said resin into a continuous resin kneading<br>
apparatus such as an extruder and then introducing a<br>
plasticizer in certain ratio, as heat-melting the resin<br>
to carry out screw kneading of them, thereby obtaining<br>
a homogeneous solution. Shape of the resin charged may<br>
be any of powder, granule or pellet. Shape of the<br>
plasticizer is preferably liquid at an ambient<br>
temperature in a case to dissolve homogeneously by such<br>
a method. As an extruder, a single screw type<br>
extruder, a counter-rotating twin screw type extruder<br>
and a co-rotating twin screw type extruder can be used.<br>
The second method for homogeneously<br>
dissolving a composition containing a thermoplastic<br>
resin and a plasticizer comprises pre-mixing and<br>
dispersing a resin and a plasticizer using an agitator<br>
such as a Henschel mixer, and introducing the thus<br>
obtained composition into a continuous resin kneading<br>
apparatus such as an extruder to knead the composition,<br>
thereby obtaining a homogeneous solution. Shape of a<br>
composition introduced may be slurry in the case of the<br>
plasticizer being liquid at an ambient temperature, and<br>
powder or granule in the case of the plasticizer being<br>
a solid at an ambient temperature.<br>
The third method for homogeneously dissolving<br>
a composition containing a thermoplastic resin and a<br>
plasticizer is a method to use a simple resin kneading<br>
apparatus such as Brabender or mill, or a method to<br>
perform melt kneading in other batch type kneading<br>
containers. This method, although not good in<br>
productivity due to a batch process, has advantages<br>
such as simplicity and high flexibility.<br>
In the present invention, a composition<br>
containing a thermoplastic resin and a plasticizer is<br>
heated at a temperature not lower than a crystal<br>
melting point of a thermoplastic resin, followed by<br>
being extruded from a discharge opening of a T-die, a<br>
circular die or circular spinneret into a shape such as<br>
a flat membrane or a hollow fiber in the step (a), and<br>
then transferred to the step (b) for cooling and<br>
solidification to make a formed product, in which a<br>
fine structure layer is formed as well as a coarse<br>
structure layer is formed adjacent to a membrane<br>
surface.<br>
In the present invention, a homogeneously<br>
heated and dissolved composition containing a<br>
thermoplastic resin and a plasticizer is extruded from<br>
a discharge opening, and a coarse structure layer and a<br>
fine structure layer are formed by contacting said<br>
membrane with a non-volatile liquid, which has a<br>
partial solubility for said thermoplastic resin, in one<br>
surface of a membrane under a heated state at a<br>
temperature not lower than 100Â°C and cooling the other<br>
surface of a membrane, while said membrane is drawn at<br>
such a draw rate that a draft ratio defined below<br>
becomes not less than 1 and not higher than 12;<br>
Draft ratio=(draw rate of membrane)/(discharge speed of<br>
composition at discharge opening).<br>
Said draft ratio is preferably not lower than<br>
1.5 and not higher than 9, more preferably not lower<br>
than 1.5 and not higher than 7. A draft ratio below 1<br>
lowers processability because no tension is given to a<br>
membrane, and a draft ratio above 12 makes difficult to<br>
form a coarse structure layer with a sufficient<br>
thickness because a membrane is extended too much. An<br>
extrusion rate of a composition at a discharge opening<br>
herein is given by the following equation:<br>
Extrusion rate of composition at discharge opening =<br>
(volume of composition extruded per unit time)/(area of<br>
discharge opening)<br>
A range of extrusion rate is preferably 1<br>
60 m/min, more preferably 3-40 m/min. An extrusion<br>
rate less than 1 m/min causes problems such as lowering<br>
of productivity and an increased fluctuation in an<br>
extrusion amount. To the contrary, an extrusion rate<br>
over 60 m/min may cause turbulence at a discharge<br>
opening due to an extrusion amount that is too large,<br>
resulting in instability of an extrusion state.<br>
Draw rate can be set depending on an<br>
extrusion rate but is preferably 1 - 200 m/min, more<br>
preferably 3 - 150 m/min. A draw rate less than 1<br>
m/min lowers productivity and membrane forming<br>
property, whereas a draw rate over 200 m/min tends to<br>
cause a membrane fracture due to a shorter cooling time<br>
and a larger tension given to a membrane.<br>
A preferable method for forming a coarse<br>
structure layer is a method to extrude a composition<br>
containing a thermoplastic resin and a. plasticizer from<br>
an discharge opening into a flat membrane or a hollow<br>
fiber like membrane, then to contact at least one<br>
surface of an unhardened membrane thus formed with a<br>
non-volatile liquid which has a partial solubility to a<br>
thermoplastic resin. In this method, a coarse<br>
structure layer is formed by a diffusion of a liquid<br>
contacted into an inside of membrane and a partial<br>
dissolution of a thermoplastic resin. A liquid which<br>
has a partial solubility to a thermoplastic resin<br>
herein is a liquid which can form a homogeneous<br>
solution only at a temperature not lower than 100Â°C,<br>
when mixed with a thermoplastic resin in a<br>
concentration of 50% by weight, and preferably a liquid<br>
which can form a homogeneous solution at a temperature<br>
not lower than 100Â°C and not higher than 250Â°C, and more<br>
preferably a liquid which can form a homogeneous<br>
solution at a temperature not lower than 120Â°C and not<br>
higher than 200Â°C. Use of a liquid which homogeneously<br>
dissolves at a temperature below 100Â°C as a contacting<br>
liquid, may cause disadvantages such as lowering of<br>
membrane forming property due to insufficient cooling<br>
and solidification of a solution of a composition<br>
containing a thermoplastic resin and a plasticizer, an<br>
increased thickness of a coarse structure layer more<br>
than required and a too large pore diameter. A liquid<br>
which can not form a homogeneous solution at a<br>
temperature below 250Â°C makes difficult to form a coarse<br>
structure layer with a sufficient thickness due to a<br>
lower solubility to a thermoplastic resin. In<br>
addition, a non-volatile liquid described herein is a<br>
liquid having a boiling point above 250Â°C under 1<br>
atmosphere of pressure.<br>
For example, when polyvinylidene fluoride<br>
resins are selected as a thermoplastic resin,<br>
preferably phthalate esters, adipate esters and<br>
sebacate esters whose ester chains have a carbon chain<br>
length not longer than 7, and phosphate esters and<br>
citrate esters whose ester chains have a carbon chain<br>
length not longer than 8 can be used; and diheptyl<br>
phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate,<br>
dimethyl phthalate, dibutyl adipate, dibutyl sebacate,<br>
tri(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate, tributyl phosphate and<br>
tributyl acetyl citrate are particularly preferable.<br>
However, a plasticizer whose ester chain has a cyclic<br>
structure such as phenyl, cresyl or cyclohexyl group,<br>
for example, dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP), triphenyl<br>
phosphate (TPP), diphenylcresyl phosphate (CDP) and<br>
tricresyl phosphate (TCP) and the like is exceptionally<br>
not preferable, because such plasticizer has less<br>
ability to form a coarse structure layer.<br>
Temperature of a contacting liquid used to<br>
introduce a coarse structure layer is not lower than<br>
100Â°C, preferably not lower than 120Â°C and not higher<br>
than a temperature of a homogeneous solution of a<br>
thermoplastic resin and a plasticizer, more preferably<br>
not lower than 130Â°C and not higher than [a temperature<br>
of a homogeneous solution of a thermoplastic resin and<br>
a plasticizer - 10Â°C]. A temperature of said contacting<br>
liquid below 100Â°C tends to make if difficult to form a<br>
coarse structure layer with a sufficient thickness due<br>
to a lower solubility to a thermoplastic resin. A<br>
temperature over [a temperature of a homogeneous<br>
solution of a thermoplastic resin and a plasticizer]<br>
lowers a membrane forming property.<br>
When a coarse structure layer is introduced<br>
only in one surface of a microporous membrane, a<br>
cooling method of the other surface, which corresponds<br>
to a side of a fine structure layer, can be in<br>
accordance with conventional methods. That is, a<br>
method to cool down by contacting with a heat<br>
conductive body can be used. As a heat conductive<br>
body, metal, water, air or a plasticizer itself can be<br>
used. More specifically, such a method for introducing<br>
a coarse structure layer is possible as extruding a<br>
homogeneous solution containing a thermoplastic resin<br>
and a plasticizer through a T-die and the like as a<br>
sheet, cooling by contacting with a metal roll and<br>
contacting the other surface of membrane, which does<br>
not contact with a roll, with a non-volatile liquid<br>
having a partial solubility to a thermoplastic resin.<br>
Alternatively, such a method is also possible as<br>
extruding a homogeneous solution containing a<br>
thermoplastic resin and a plasticizer from a circular<br>
die or a circular spinneret in a tubular or hollow<br>
fiber like form, passing a non-volatile liquid having a<br>
partial solubility to a thermoplastic resin through<br>
inside of said tube or hollow fiber to form a coarse<br>
structure layer in an inner surface side, and cooling<br>
an outside by contacting with a cooling medium such as<br>
water.<br>
When coarse structure layers are introduced<br>
in both surfaces of a microporous membrane, a<br>
homogeneous solution containing a thermoplastic resin<br>
and a plasticizer is extruded from a T-die, a circular<br>
die or a circular spinneret in a specified shape, then<br>
contacted in both surfaces of said solution with a non-<br>
volatile liquid having a partial solubility to a<br>
thermoplastic resin to form coarse structure layers,<br>
thereafter cooled and solidified. A cooling method in<br>
this process can be in accordance with conventional<br>
methods. If a time from contacting with a non-volatile<br>
liquid having a partial solubility to a thermoplastic<br>
resin to starting to cool becomes longer, disadvantages<br>
may arise such as a lowered membrane forming property<br>
and a lowered membrane strength. Therefore, the time<br>
from contacting with a liquid to starting to cool is<br>
preferably not longer than 30 seconds, more preferably<br>
not longer than 20 seconds and most preferably not<br>
longer than 10 seconds.<br>
In a manufacturing method for the microporous<br>
membrane of the present invention, cooling rate in<br>
cooling and solidification is preferably sufficiently<br>
fast to form a uniform fine structure layer with a<br>
small pore diameter. Cooling rate is preferably not<br>
slower than 50Â°C/min, more preferably 100 - 1 x 105<br>
Â°C/min and further more preferably 200 - 2 x 104 Â°C/min.<br>
More concretely, a method to contact with a metal-made<br>
chill roll or water is suitably used, and in<br>
particular, contacting with water is a preferable<br>
method because rapid cooling can be attained by an<br>
evaporation of water.<br>
In the present invention, an extraction<br>
solvent is used to remove a plasticizer. Preferably,<br>
an extraction solvent is a poor solvent for a<br>
thermoplastic resin and a good solvent for a<br>
plasticizer as well as having a boiling point lower<br>
than the melting point of a microporous membrane. Such<br>
an extraction solvent includes hydrocarbons such as<br>
hexane and cyclohexane; halogenated hydrocarbons such<br>
as methylene chloride and 1,1,1-trichloroethane;<br>
alcohols such as ethanol and isopropanol; ethers such<br>
as diethyl ether and tetrahydrofurane; ketones such as<br>
acetone and 2-butanone; and water.<br>
The first method for removing a plasticizer<br>
in the present invention is done by immersing a<br>
microporous membrane cut out into a specified size into<br>
a vessel containing an extraction solvent, washing it<br>
sufficiently, then drying adhered solvent by air drying<br>
or hot air drying. Repeated operations of such<br>
immersion and washing are preferable to reduce residual<br>
plasticizer in a microporous membrane. It is<br>
preferable to fix both ends of a microporous membrane<br>
during a series of operations of immersion, washing and<br>
drying to suppress shrinkage of microporous membrane.<br>
The second method for removing a plasticizer<br>
in the present invention is done by continuously<br>
feeding a microporous membrane into a tank filled with<br>
an extraction solvent, immersing in a tank in<br>
sufficient time to remove a plasticizer, then drying<br>
adhered solvent. In this process, it is preferable,<br>
for improving an extraction efficiency, to adopt well<br>
known means such as a multistage method in which the<br>
inside of a tank is divided into a plurality of small<br>
tanks and a microporous membrane is fed sequentially<br>
into the small tanks with decreasing concentrations, or<br>
a counter-flow method in which an extraction solvent is<br>
fed against a running direction of a microporous<br>
membrane to obtain a gradient concentration. In both<br>
the first and the second methods, it is important to<br>
substantially remove a plasticizer from a microporous<br>
membrane. "Substantially remove" herein means to<br>
remove a plasticizer in a microporous membrane to such<br>
a degree as not to impair a performance as a separation<br>
membrane. A residual amount of a plasticizer in a<br>
microporous membrane is preferably not more than 1% by<br>
weight, and more preferably not more than 100 ppm by<br>
weight. A residual amount of a plasticizer in a<br>
microporous membrane can be quantitatively determined<br>
by gas chromatography or liquid chromatography. It is<br>
also preferable to heat an extraction solvent at a<br>
temperature within the range below a boiling point of<br>
said solvent, preferably below a boiling point - 5Â°C, to<br>
accelerate diffusions of a plasticizer and a solvent<br>
and thus improve extraction efficiency.<br>
In the present invention, if a heat treatment<br>
is applied to a microporous membrane before, after or<br>
before and after the step of removing a plasticizer,<br>
such effects can be obtained as a reduced shrinkage<br>
during a removal process of a plasticizer and<br>
improvements in membrane strength and heat resistance.<br>
Method for heat treatment includes placing a<br>
microporous membrane in hot air, immersing a<br>
microporous membrane in a heating medium and contacting<br>
a microporous membrane with a metal roll at an elevated<br>
and regulated temperature. A heat treatment under a<br>
state of fixed dimension is preferable to prevent<br>
particularly collapsing of micropores.<br>
Temperature for heat treatment varies<br>
depending on an object or a melting point of a<br>
thermoplastic resin, but for a polyvinylidene fluoride<br>
membrane used for viral removal, the temperature is<br>
preferably 121-170Â°C, and more preferably 125-165Â°C. A<br>
temperature of 121Â°C is generally adopted as a<br>
temperature for high pressure steam sterilization and a<br>
heat treatment at a temperature not lower than this<br>
makes it possible to prevent shrinkage or deformation<br>
during a high pressure steam sterilization. A<br>
temperature above 170Â°C may cause problems such as a<br>
membrane fracture and collapsing of micropores during a<br>
heat treatment, because the temperature is close to a<br>
melting point of polyvinylidene fluoride.<br>
When the microporous membrane of the present<br>
invention is used for an application of viral removal,<br>
it becomes necessary to provide a hydrophilic nature to<br>
a membrane to prevent clogging caused by adsorption of<br>
proteins. Method for hydrophilization includes, for<br>
example, immersing a microporous membrane in a solution<br>
containing a surfactant, followed by drying and<br>
allowing a surfactant to remain in a microporous<br>
membrane; grafting of a hydrophilic acrylic monomer,<br>
methacrylic monomer or the like onto a pore surface of<br>
a microporous membrane by irradiating an actinic<br>
radiation such as electron beam or gamma ray or by<br>
using a peroxide; blending a hydrophilic polymer in<br>
membrane formation in advance; and immersing a<br>
microporous membrane in a solution containing a<br>
hydrophilic polymer, followed by drying to make a<br>
coated film of a hydrophilic polymer on a pore surface<br>
of a microporous membrane. The grafting method is most<br>
preferable in view of durability of a hydrophilic<br>
property or possible risk of leakage of hydrophilic<br>
additives. In particular, a hydrophilization treatment<br>
by a radiation-induced graft polymerization method<br>
disclosed in JP-A-62-179540, JP-A-62-258711 and USP<br>
No.4,885,086 is preferable in view of forming an<br>
uniform hydrophilic layer in an inner surface of<br>
micropores in the whole region of membrane.<br>
A hydrophilization treatment by a radiation-<br>
induced graft polymerization method herein comprises a<br>
step of generating radicals in a resin consisting<br>
microporous membrane and a step of contacting a<br>
microporous membrane with hydrophilic monomer(s).<br>
Either a method of generating radicals and then<br>
contacting with hydrophilic monomers or a method of<br>
reverse order thereof is possible, but the method of<br>
generating radicals and then contacting with<br>
hydrophilic monomers is preferable from the viewpoint<br>
that less free oligomer is formed from hydrophilic<br>
monomer(s).<br>
In contacting a microporous membrane with<br>
hydrophilic monomer(s), hydrophilic monomer(s) may be<br>
any state of gas, liquid or solution, but a liquid or a<br>
solution state is preferable, and a solution state is<br>
particularly preferable in order to form a uniform<br>
hydrophilized layer.<br>
As a hydrophilic monomer, acrylic and<br>
methacrylic monomers having sulfone group, carboxylic<br>
group, amide group and neutral hydroxyl group can be<br>
suitably used, but monomers with a neutral hydroxyl<br>
group are particularly preferable in filtering a<br>
solution containing proteins. Further, in grafting<br>
hydrophilic monomer(s), an addition of a monomer having<br>
two or more vinyl groups as a crosslinking agent is<br>
preferable to suppress swelling of a hydrophilized<br>
layer.<br>
In the present invention, an additional<br>
treatment may further be carried out so long as not to<br>
impair the microporous membrane of the present<br>
invention. The additional treatment includes a<br>
crosslinking treatment by an ionizing radiation and the<br>
like and an introduction of a functional group using a<br>
chemical modification of surface.<br>
In a composition used in the present<br>
invention, additional additives may further be mixed<br>
depending on an object, such as antioxidant, crystal<br>
nucleating agent, antistatic agent, flame retardant,<br>
lubricant and UV absorbing agent.<br>
The microporous membrane with heat resistance<br>
of the present invention can be utilized in a wide<br>
range of applications such as a separation membrane for<br>
medical use for removal of viruses and bacteria,<br>
thickening or culture medium; a filter for industrial<br>
process to remove minute particles from chemicals,<br>
treated water or the like; a separation membrane for an<br>
oil/water separation or a liquid/gas separation; a<br>
separation membrane for purification of water supply<br>
and sewage; a separator for lithium ion battery and the<br>
like; and a solid electrolyte supporting body for<br>
polymer cell, and the like.<br>
The present invention will be described in<br>
detail by using Examples. Test methods shown in<br>
Examples are as follows:<br>
(1) Outer diameter, inner diameter and membrane<br>
thickness of a hollow fiber<br>
Outer diameter and inner diameter of hollow<br>
fiber like microporous membrane were determined by-<br>
photographing a vertically cut cross-section of said<br>
membrane using a stereoscopic microscope. A membrane<br>
thickness was calculated as 1/2 of a difference between<br>
an outer diameter and an inner diameter of a hollow<br>
fiber.<br>
(2) Porosity<br>
Porosity was calculated using the following<br>
equation from measurement results of a volume and a<br>
weight of a microporous membrane.<br>
Porosity(%) = [1 - weight Ã· (resin density x volume)] x<br>
100<br>
(3) Water permeation rate<br>
Water permeation amount for pure water was<br>
measured at 25Â°C by a dead end filtration under a<br>
constant pressure. Water permeation rate was<br>
calculated using the following equation based on a<br>
membrane surface area, a filtration pressure (0.1 MPa),<br>
a filtration time and a membrane thickness.<br>
Water permeation rate (m3/m2/sec/Pa/25 Âµm) = permeation<br>
amountÃ·[membrane surface area x pressure difference x<br>
filtration time x (25 Âµm/membrane thickness)]<br>
(4) Maximum pore diameter<br>
Maximum pore diameter (nm) was obtained by a<br>
conversion of bubble point (Pa) determined by the<br>
bubble point method in accordance with ASTM F316-86. A<br>
fluorocarbon liquid with a surface tension of 12 mN/m<br>
(Perfluorocarbon coolant FX-3250 (tradename) made by<br>
Sumitomo 3M Ltd.) was used as a test solution for<br>
immersing a membrane.<br>
(5) Tensile break strength and tensile break elongation<br>
Tensile test was conducted using "Autograph<br>
Model AG-A" made by Shimadzu Corp. under the conditions<br>
of test piece length:100 mm; distance between chucks<br>
(gauge length):50 mm; cross head speed:200 mm/min; and<br>
measurement temperature:23Â±2Â°C. Tensile break strength<br>
and tensile break elongation were calculated by the<br>
following equations from a load at break, a strain at<br>
break and a cross-sectional area of membrane.<br>
Tensile break strength (N/m2) = load at break Ã· cross-<br>
sectional area of membrane<br>
Tensile break elongation (%) = (strain at break Ã·<br>
distance between chucks) x 100<br>
(6) Structural observation of a microporous membrane<br>
A microporous membrane cut out in an<br>
appropriate size was fixed on a sample holder using an<br>
electrically conductive both-side adhesive tape, and<br>
coated with gold to provide a sample for observation.<br>
Structural observation was conducted on a surface and a<br>
cross-section of a microporous membrane using a high<br>
resolution scanning electron microscope (HRSEM) under<br>
an acceleration voltage of 5.0 kV and a specified<br>
magnification.<br>
(7) Open pore ratio and average open pore ratio<br>
As described above, open pore ratio was<br>
obtained by dividing an observation result of cross-<br>
sectional structure along a vertical direction against<br>
a membrane surface of a microporous membrane into<br>
regions with a 1 Âµm thickness each along a thickness<br>
direction, and then calculating a fraction of area<br>
occupied by voids in each divided region by an image<br>
analysis. In this procedure, photographing by an<br>
electron microscope was conducted at 15,000<br>
magnifications. Average open pore ratio is an average<br>
value of open pore ratios for regions in a certain<br>
membrane thickness.<br>
(8) Thickness of a coarse structure layer and ratio of<br>
a fine structure layer to the whole membrane thickness<br>
In the above described measurement of open<br>
pore ratio, it was judged whether each divided region<br>
met the definitions of a fine structure layer and a<br>
coarse structure layer defined in the. present<br>
specification. That is, a coarse structure layer is a<br>
continuous region which is present adjacent to a<br>
membrane surface and has an open pore ratio measured<br>
along a thickness direction not less than 2% larger<br>
than an average open pore ratio for the whole membrane<br>
thickness. A fine structure layer is a region other<br>
than a coarse structure layer, which has an open pore<br>
ratio measured along a thickness direction within a<br>
range less than an average open pore ratio for a region<br>
excluding the coarse structure layer Â±2%. A ratio of<br>
a fine structure layer to the whole membrane thickness<br>
is a value obtained by summing up a thickness of each<br>
satisfying divided region and then dividing the sum by<br>
the whole membrane thickness.<br>
(9) Average pore diameter of a surface in a coarse<br>
structure layer side<br>
The number and an area of pores present in a<br>
surface were measured by an image analysis from<br>
structural observation results on a surface in a coarse<br>
structure layer side. A circle equivalent diameter was<br>
obtained from an average area per pore, assuming each<br>
pore as a circle. This circle equivalent diameter was<br>
used as an average pore diameter of a surface in a<br>
coarse structure layer side. Photographing by an<br>
electron microscope for this measurement was conducted<br>
at 6,000 magnifications.<br>
(10) Cooling rate<br>
In a cooling and solidifying step, a cooling<br>
rate in a case of a coolant bath such as water was<br>
determined as follows using an infrared thermometer. A<br>
colorless transparent composition in a molten state was<br>
cooled with cold air, and a solidification temperature<br>
was determined by measuring a temperature of the<br>
composition using a infrared thermometer when the<br>
composition began to whiten by crystallization and<br>
solidification. Then, said composition was introduced<br>
into a coolant bath to be cooled and solidified, and a<br>
temperature of the composition just before contacting<br>
with the coolant bath was measured using an infrared<br>
thermometer, as an initial temperature. Then, a<br>
solidification time was measured as a period from a<br>
time when said composition contacted with the coolant<br>
bath to a time when said composition whitened by<br>
cooling and solidifying. A cooling rate was calculated<br>
according to the following equation:<br>
Cooling rate (Â°C/min) = 60 x (initial temperature -<br>
solidification temperature) Ã· solidification time (sec)<br>
(11) Filtration test of a 3% solution of bovine<br>
immunoglobulin<br>
A bovine immunoglobulin solution which was<br>
made by Life Technology Co. Ltd. was diluted to 3% by<br>
weight with physiological saline (made by Otsuka<br>
Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.) specified by Japanese<br>
Pharmacopoeia and then pre-filtered with PLANOVA 35N<br>
made by Asahi Kasei Corp. to remove foreign materials<br>
was used as a test liquid for filtration. As a result<br>
of a measurement of a molecular weight distribution for<br>
the bovine immunoglobulin in said test liquid for<br>
filtration by a liquid chromatography, it was found<br>
that a ratio of multimers such as dimer or more was<br>
20%. Said test liquid for filtration was filtered by a<br>
dead end filtration under a filtration pressure of 0.3<br>
MPa and a filtration temperature at 25Â°C to measure an<br>
integrated permeation amount for a filtration time of 3<br>
hours and permeation rates at 5 min., 30 min. and 60<br>
min. after starting the filtration.<br>
Example 1<br>
A composition consisting of 44% by weight of<br>
a polyvinylidene fluoride resin (SOFEF1012 made by<br>
SOLVAY, crystal melting point of 173Â°C) and 56% by<br>
weight of dicyclohexyl phthalate (made by Osaka Org.<br>
Chem. Ind. Ltd., industrial grade) was mixed under an<br>
agitation using a Henschel mixer at 70Â°C, followed by<br>
cooling to obtain a powder-like material, which was<br>
charged to a hopper of twin screw extruder<br>
(Laboplastmill Model 50C 150 made by Toyo Seiki<br>
Seisaku-Syo, Ltd.) and melt mixed at 210Â°C to attain a<br>
homogeneous dissolution. Subsequently, the composition<br>
was extruded in a form of a hollow fiber from a<br>
spinneret consisting of a circular orifice with an<br>
inner diameter of 0.8 mm and an outer diameter of 1.2<br>
mm at an extrusion rate of 12 m/min, while diheptyl<br>
phthalate (made by Sanken Chem. Co., Ltd.) was fed at<br>
130Â°C into a hollow part at a rate of 7 ml/min. The<br>
extrudate was cooled and solidified in a water bath<br>
thermo-controlled at 40Â°C, and wound up on a hank at a<br>
rate of 60 m/min (a draft ratio of 5 times).<br>
Thereafter, dicyclohexyl phthalate and diheptyl<br>
phthalate were removed by an extraction with 99%<br>
methanol denaturated ethanol (made by Imazu Chem. Co.,<br>
Ltd., industrial grade) and adhered ethanol was<br>
replaced with water. The resultant membrane was then<br>
thermally treated at 125Â°C for 1 hour using high<br>
pressure steam sterilization equipment (HV-85 made by<br>
Hirayama Seisaku-Syo Co., Ltd.) in immersed state in<br>
water. The membrane was fixed at a constant length<br>
during the thermal treatment to prevent shrinkage.<br>
After that, the membrane was dried in an oven at 110Â°C<br>
to obtain a hollow fiber like microporous membrane. A<br>
maximum pore diameter of the thus obtained microporous<br>
membrane was 40 nm, and observation results of a cross-<br>
sectional structure of the membrane by a scanning<br>
electron microscope showed that a thickness of a coarse<br>
structure layer formed adjacent to an inner surface<br>
side was 12 Âµm and a ratio of a fine structure layer to<br>
the whole membrane thickness was 82%. A whole image of<br>
cross-section, a magnified photograph of the vicinity<br>
of an inner surface and a photograph of an inner<br>
surface in a coarse structure layer side of the hollow<br>
fiber like membrane are shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 2 and<br>
Fig. 3, respectively. An open pore ratio for each<br>
divided region of 1 Âµm thickness along a thickness<br>
direction from an inner surface side of the microporous<br>
membrane and physical properties of said microporous<br>
membrane are shown in Table 1 and Table 2,<br>
respectively.<br>
Example 2<br>
A hollow fiber like microporous membrane was<br>
obtained in accordance with Example 1 except that a<br>
polyvinylidene fluoride resin and dicyclohexyl<br>
phthalate were melt mixed to get a homogeneously<br>
dissolved solution, which was extruded in a form of<br>
hollow fiber from a spinneret at an extrusion rate of<br>
9.5 m/min (a draft ratio of 6.3 times). A maximum pore<br>
diameter of thus obtained microporous membrane was 40<br>
nm, and observation results of a cross-sectional<br>
structure of the membrane by a scanning electron<br>
microscope showed that a thickness of a coarse<br>
structure layer formed adjacent to an inner surface<br>
side was 9 Âµm and a ratio of a fine structure layer to<br>
the whole membrane thickness was 82%. Physical<br>
properties of this microporous membrane are shown in<br>
Table 2.<br>
Example 3<br>
A hollow fiber like microporous membrane was<br>
obtained in accordance with Example 1 except that a<br>
polyvinylidene fluoride resin and dicyclohexyl<br>
phthalate were melt mixed to get a homogeneously<br>
dissolved solution, which was extruded in a form of<br>
hollow fiber from a spinneret at an extrusion rate of<br>
5.5 m/min (a draft ratio of 10.9 times). A maximum<br>
pore diameter of the thus obtained microporous membrane<br>
was 39 nm, and observation results of a cross-sectional<br>
structure of the membrane by a scanning electron<br>
microscope showed that a thickness of a coarse<br>
structure layer formed adjacent to an inner surface<br>
side was 7 Âµm and a ratio of a fine structure layer to<br>
the whole membrane thickness was 84%. Physical<br>
properties of this microporous membrane are shown in<br>
Table 2.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
A hollow fiber like microporous membrane was<br>
obtained in accordance with Example 3 except that<br>
diphenylcresyl phosphate (made by Daihachi Chem. Ind.<br>
Co., Ltd., industrial grade) was fed into a hollow part<br>
at 7 ml/min. A maximum pore diameter of the thus<br>
obtained microporous membrane was 38 nm, and<br>
observation results of a cross-sectional structure of<br>
the membrane showed that a thickness of a coarse<br>
structure layer formed adjacent to an inner surface<br>
side was 3 Âµm and a ratio of a fine structure layer to<br>
the whole membrane thickness was 90%. Physical<br>
properties of this microporous membrane are shown in<br>
Table 2.<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
A hollow fiber like microporous membrane was<br>
obtained in accordance with Example 3 except that di(2-<br>
ethylhexyl) phosphate (made by Daihachi Chem. Ind. Co.,<br>
Ltd., industrial grade) was fed into a hollow part at 7<br>
ml/min. A maximum pore diameter of the thus obtained<br>
microporous membrane was 39 nm, and observation results<br>
of a cross-sectional structure of the membrane showed<br>
that a thickness of a coarse structure layer formed<br>
adjacent to an inner surface side was thinner than 1 Âµm<br>
and a ratio of a fine structure layer to the whole<br>
membrane thickness was about 100%.<br>
Example 4<br>
A composition consisting of 44% by weight of<br>
a polyvinylidene fluoride resin (SOFEF1012 made by<br>
SOLVAY, crystal melting point of 173Â°C) and 56% by<br>
weight of dicyclohexyl phthalate (made by OSAKA ORGANIC<br>
CHEMICAL IND. LTD., industrial grade) was mixed under<br>
an agitation using a Henschel mixer at 70Â°C, followed by<br>
cooling to obtain a powder-like material, which was<br>
charged to a hopper of twin screw extruder<br>
(Laboplastmill Model 50C 150 made by Toyo Seiki<br>
Seisaku-Syo, Ltd.) and melt mixed at 220Â°C to attain a<br>
homogeneous dissolution. Subsequently, the composition<br>
was extruded in a form of hollow fiber from a spinneret<br>
consisting of a circular orifice with an inner diameter<br>
of 0.8 mm and an outer diameter of 1.2 mm at an<br>
extrusion rate of 5.5 m/min, while diheptyl phthalate<br>
(made by Sanken Chem. Co., Ltd.) was fed at 120Â°C into a<br>
hollow part at a rate of 7 ml/min. The extrudate was<br>
cooled and solidified in a water bath thermo-controlled<br>
at 40Â°C, and wound up on a hank at a rate of 60 m/min (a<br>
draft ratio of 10.9 times). A cooling rate in the<br>
cooling and solidifying was about 5,000Â°C /min.<br>
Thereafter, dicyclohexyl phthalate and diheptyl<br>
phthalate were removed by an extraction with n-hexane<br>
(made by Kishida Chem. Co., Ltd., special grade) and<br>
adhered hexane was removed by drying. The resultant<br>
membrane was then thermally treated at 130Â°C for 1 hour<br>
in an oven to obtain a hollow fiber like microporous<br>
membrane. The membrane was fixed at a constant length<br>
during the thermal treatment to prevent shrinkage. A<br>
maximum pore diameter of the thus obtained microporous<br>
membrane was 38 nm, and observation results of a cross-<br>
sectional structure of the membrane by a scanning<br>
electron microscope showed that a thickness of a coarse<br>
structure layer formed adjacent to an inner surface<br>
side was 7 Âµm and a ratio of a fine structure layer to<br>
the whole membrane thickness was 75%. Physical<br>
properties of this microporous membrane are shown in<br>
Table 3.<br>
Example 5<br>
A hollow fiber like microporous membrane was<br>
obtained in accordance with Example 4 except that<br>
dibutyl phthalate was fed into a hollow part at 7<br>
ml/min. A maximum pore diameter of the thus obtained<br>
microporous membrane was 39 nm, and observation results<br>
of a cross-sectional structure of the membrane by a<br>
scanning electron microscope showed that a thickness of<br>
a coarse structure layer formed adjacent to an inner<br>
surface side was 12 Âµm and a ratio of a fine structure<br>
layer to the whole membrane thickness was 60%.<br>
Physical properties of this microporous membrane are<br>
shown in Table 3.<br>
Comparative Example 3<br>
A hollow fiber like microporous membrane was<br>
obtained in accordance with Example 4 except that air<br>
was fed into a hollow part at 7 ml/min. A maximum pore<br>
diameter of the thus obtained microporous membrane was<br>
37 nm, and observation results of a cross-sectional<br>
structure of the membrane showed that the structure was<br>
homogeneous along a membrane thickness direction, no<br>
coarse structure layer was present and a ratio of a<br>
fine structure layer to the whole membrane thickness<br>
was 100%. Furthermore, a skin layer with a low open<br>
pore ratio had been formed in an inner surface of this<br>
microporous membrane. Physical properties of this<br>
microporous membrane are shown in Table 3.<br>
Example 6<br>
A hollow fiber like microporous membrane was<br>
obtained in accordance with Example 4 except that<br>
triphenyl phosphate was used as a plasticizer and<br>
tri(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate was fed into a hollow part<br>
at 7 ml/min. A maximum pore diameter of the thus<br>
obtained microporous membrane was 40 nm, and<br>
observation results of a cross-sectional structure of<br>
the membrane by a scanning electron microscope showed<br>
that a thickness of a coarse structure layer formed<br>
adjacent to an inner surface side was 9 Âµm and a ratio<br>
of a fine structure layer to the whole membrane<br>
thickness was 69%. Physical properties of this<br>
microporous membrane are shown in Table 3.<br>
Example 7<br>
A microporous membrane obtained by Example 1<br>
was hydrophilized using a grafting method. A reaction<br>
i liquid was prepared by dissolving hydroxypropyl<br>
acrylate and poly(ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate) in a<br>
25% by vol. of 3-butanol aqueous solution so that<br>
concentrations of the former and the latter chemicals<br>
became 1.1% by vol. and 0.6% by weight, respectively,<br>
and subjected to a nitrogen bubbling for 20 min. while<br>
maintained at 40Â°C before use. Firstly, said<br>
microporous membrane was irradiated with 100 kGy of<br>
Co60 ?-ray under a nitrogen atmosphere. The irradiated<br>
membrane was left under a reduced pressure not higher<br>
than 13.4 Pa for 15 min, then contacted with the above<br>
described reaction liquid at 40Â°C and left for further 2<br>
hours. After that, the membrane was washed with<br>
ethanol, vacuum dried at 60Â°C for 4 hours to get a<br>
hydrophilized microporous membrane. A weight increase<br>
of the resultant membrane was 14%. The thus obtained<br>
membrane was found to show a spontaneous water<br>
penetration into pores when contacted with water. A<br>
filtration test for 3% bovine immunoglobulin solution<br>
using this membrane revealed that a decrease in<br>
filtration rate was little and a clogging of membrane<br>
was also little as shown in Table 4.<br>
Example 8<br>
A hydrophilized microporous membrane was<br>
obtained by the similar method as in Example 7 using<br>
the membrane obtained in Example 2. A weight increase<br>
of the thus obtained membrane was 13%. The resultant<br>
membrane was found to show a spontaneous water<br>
penetration into pores when contacted with water. A<br>
filtration test for 3% bovine immunoglobulin solution<br>
using this membrane revealed that a decrease in<br>
filtration rate was little and a clogging of membrane<br>
was also little as shown in Table 4.<br>
Example 9<br>
A hydrophilized microporous membrane was<br>
obtained by the similar method as in Example 7 using<br>
the membrane obtained in Example 3. A weight increase<br>
of the thus obtained membrane was 12%. The resultant<br>
membrane was found to show a spontaneous water<br>
penetration into pores when contacted with water. A<br>
filtration test for 3% bovine immunoglobulin solution<br>
using this membrane revealed that a decrease in<br>
filtration rate was little and a clogging of membrane<br>
was also little as shown in Table 4.<br>
Comparative Example 4<br>
A hydrophilized microporous membrane was<br>
obtained by the similar method as in Example 7 using<br>
the membrane obtained in Comparative Example 1. A<br>
weight increase of the thus obtained membrane was 10%.<br>
The resultant membrane was found to show a spontaneous<br>
water penetration into pores when contacted with water.<br>
A filtration test for 3% bovine immunoglobulin solution<br>
using this membrane revealed that a decrease in<br>
filtration rate with the passage of time was<br>
remarkable as shown in Table 4. This is considered to be brought about by<br>
the multimers of bovine immunoglobulin which clogged<br>
pores in an inner surface side of the microporous<br>
membrane.<br>
