				<td>Microbicidal dendrimer composition delivery system<br>
The present invention relates to the prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted infections and, in particular, relates to the use of a condom carrying a dendrimer having naphthyl disulfonate terminal groups.<br>
The global incidence of morbidity and mortality of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) caused by Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Herpes virus (HSV) and other viral and microbial pathogens is estimated at several hundred million individuals worldwide. One approach to control the transmission of STIs is the use of topically applied, female/male controlled vaginal or rectal microbicides that inactivate the relevant pathogens.<br>
It has further been found that the use of detergent-based microbicides such as nonoxynol-9 (N-9) may have adverse effects in the prevention of HSV-2 or HIV. Whilst such detergents act by disrupting HSV and HIV membranes, they may also compromise the natural vaginal barrier and significantly increase susceptibility to infection.<br>
International patent application'no PCT/AU02/00407 (WO 02/079299), to applicants, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, discloses a class of dendrimers, (highly branched macromolecules with a definite envelope of polyanionic or cationic surface groups) which have been shown to exhibit a range of antiviral and antimicrobial activity with minimal toxicity.<br>
In antiviral and antimicrobial testing, a subset of these dendrimer structures have unexpectedly shown exceptional activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms associated with sexually transmitted infection that makes them agents of choice for the development of a vaginal or rectal microbicide for the treatment or prophylaxis of sexually transmitted infections.<br>
One compound in particular, SPL7013, formula I,<br><br>
NHR<br><br>
where R represents a group of the formula \\/<br><br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof; for example,<br><br>
has been found to have activity against various sexually transmitted infections.<br>
SPL7013 consists of a polylysine dendrimer scaffold with the active surface groups consisting of 32 naphthyl disulphonic acid groups. Each of the naphthyl disulphonate surface groups is attached to the branched dendrimer scaffold with an amido-methyleneoxy linkage to the 32 terminal groups.<br>
There are a number of options for the administration of the type of compound represented, for example, by formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or soivate thereof, in the treatment or prophylaxis of sexually transmitted infections, for example topical administration. A variety of topical administration routes are available. The particular mode selected will depend, of course, upon the particular condition being treated and the dosage required for preventative efficacy. Such modes of administration include the vaginal, rectal, oral and trans-dermal routes. Suitable formulations for topical, particularly vaginal or rectal, administration include solutions, suspensions, gels, lotions, foams, films, jellies, and creams as well as discrete units such as suppositories and microencapsulated suspensions. Other delivery systems can include sustained release delivery systems which can provide for slow release of the active component of the invention, including sustained release gels, creams, suppositories, or capsules.<br>
However, some of the topical modes of administration may have some disadvantages. For example, vaginal or rectal suppositories may not provide medication to the entire vagina or rectum due to their shape and/or placement in the vagina or rectum by the user. In addition, the medication being supplied by the suppositories may drain out of the vagina or rectum rather quickly, thus reducing the potential effectiveness of the medication. Similarly, the application of topical formulations in the form of a foam, jelly, cream or film may be messy, and the effectiveness of the formulation may be reduced due to drainage of the formulation from the vagina or rectum.<br>
Barrier methods, for example, condoms, are also used to prevent sexually transmitted infections. However, condoms have been known to rupture due to stresses, caused by, for example, stretching or incorrect use. Condoms may also develop microscopic leaks, or may contain small perforations that may lead to transfer of bodily fluids across the barrier, leading to risk of infection.<br><br>
It is, accordingly, an object of the present invention to overcome or at least alleviate one or more of the difficulties and deficiencies related to the prior art.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
In a first embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a microbicidal delivery system including:<br>
a microbicidal composition including<br>
a microbicidal compound including a dendrimer including one or more surface groups of formula IV<br><br>
o'     vo	IV,<br>
a   microbicidally   active  derivative  thereof,   or  pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof; and<br>
a carrier, excipient or diluent therefor; and a prophylactic device;<br>
the microbicidal composition being carried on a surface of the prophylactic device and being compatible therewith.<br><br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
As used herein in this specification and claims, the singular forms "a", "an" and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to a "a macromolecule" includes one or more such macromolecules.<br>
By the term "comprises" (or its grammatical variants) as used herein in this specification and claims is equivalent to the term "includes" and should not be taken as excluding the presence of other elements or features.<br>
By the term "surface of the prophylactic device' as used herein in the specification and claims, we mean either the internal surface or the external surface or both surfaces of the device.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that the efficacy of the microbicidal composition may be increased by delivery of the composition to the potential site(s) of infection concomitant with sexual activity.<br>
Further, the potential adverse consequences of the partial failure of the prophylactic device may be substantially reduced with the inclusion of the microbicidal composition, as described above.<br>
The delivery system according to this aspect of the present invention may also reduce or eliminate the adverse side effects associated with detergent-based microbicides, resulting in significantly decreased susceptibility to infection with HSV-2 or HIV.<br>
Preferably, the microbicidal compound is selected from one or more of SPL7013 (represented by formula I below), SPL7304 (represented by formula II below), SPL7320 (represented by formula III below), where R in each case is represented by the group of formula IV; a microbicidally active derivative thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof.<br><br>

The structures of these compounds consist of a polylysine dendrimer, a polypropyleneimine dendrimer, and a polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer scaffold respectively, with the active surface groups consisting of 32 naphthyi disulphonic acid groups as sodium salts. Each of the naphthyl-disulphonate functional surface groups is attached to the branched dendrimer scaffold with an arnido-methyleneoxy linkage to the 32 terminal groups. The compound SPL7013 is preferred.<br>
As described above, the compounds SPL7013, SPL7304, and SPL7320 are preferred compounds of the present invention, and have been found to exhibit significant antiviral activity, particularly against viral and microbial vectors of the most common sexually transmitted infections. Common sexually transmitted infections include, but are not limited to papillomaviruses, Chlamydia trachomatis, Candida albicans, Trichomonas vaginalis, Herpes simplex viruses, Cyclomegalovirus, Neisseria gonorrhoeas, Human Immunodeficiency viruses, Treponema pallidum, Hepatitis B and C viruses, Calymmato bacterium granulomatis, Haemophilus ducreyi, Sarcoptes scabiei, Phthirus pubis, Mycoplasma, Gardnerella vaginalis.<br>
SPL7013 exhibits a broad-spectrum antiviral activity with high efficacy and minimal cell or animal toxicity, against vectors of several of the most important vaginally or rectally sexually transmitted infections. High activity has been determined against genital Herpes virus-2 (HSV-2) both in vitro cell tests and in vivo in an animal (mouse) model test and in vitro cell tests against Herpes virus-1 (HSV-1) and Human Immunodeficiency<br><br>
viruses (HIV-1 and HIV-2). It has also been shown to be active against the causative agent of genital warts, Human Papillomavirus (HPV), and against the bacterial vector of non-specific urethritis, Chlamydia trachomatis. In cell tests, SPL7013 has also shown activity against viral strains of Herpes virus-2 that are resistant to currently used modified nucleoside based antiviral agents. In addition SPL7304 and SPL7320 show high activity against HSV-1, HSV-2, HIV-1, and HIV-2. Furthermore SPL7013, SPL7304 and SPL7320 are active in CD4-dependant and CD4-independent HIV transmission assays, and are effective at preventing HIV-1 attachment and fusion. All compounds have been shown not to inhibit the growth of various species of beneficial Lactobacillus. In addition SPL7013, SPL7304, and SPL7320 have been shown to be effective in the prevention of infection of human peripheral blood monocular cells (PBMCs) with either HIV-1 RoJoorSIVBQ. 6pd.<br>

Example 2 - Condom Stability Study 1 %, 3% and 5% of active in Carbopol gel.<br>
Individually packaged male condoms made from natural rubber latex and intended for single use meet with certain minimum requirements specified in ASTM Designation: D 3492-97 (American Society for Testing and Materials, Standard Specification for Rubber Contraceptives, Male Condoms) test method. The test method is designed to ensure that condoms are of consistent quality. Certain ingredients in vaginal formulations may compromise condom integrity. This method was used to determine the effect of vaginal formulations on condoms. The following parameters were determined for the treated and untreated condoms: pressure at burst, volume at burst, length, thickness, and width. If the formulation compromises the condoms, the pressure and volume at burst are expected to be lower. The length of the condoms might be affected as well.<br>
A 4.0 g sample of gel was spread on 7.5 cm x 410 cm aluminium foil and wrapped around a condom. The condom was placed on polypropylene dowel and dowel was wrapped with the aluminium foil containing the test article. After 30 min the aluminium foil was removed and the condom was blotted free of adhering gel. The length, width volume, and pressure at burst of the treated condoms were then measured.<br><br>
19<br>
Air Burst Properties (Pressure and Volume at Burst)<br>
1.	Carry out the test at 25 ±5°C.<br>
2.	Unroll the condom onto the mount without stretching. The length of condom tested<br>
should be 150 ± 3 mm (uninflated).<br>
3.	Seal the condom to the system with the inflatable rubber ring (this rubber ring<br>
clamps off a constant length of the condom).<br>
4.	Ensure that air cannot leak through the seal or from the system during inflation.<br>
5.	Open the valve controlling the air to the condom and at the same time initiate the<br>
chart recorder.<br>
6.	Inflate the condom at a constant rate of 0.4 to 0.5 L/s (24 to 30 L/min). Record the<br>
flow rate.<br>
7.	Pressure is recorded as a function of time until the condom bursts. An immediate<br>
rise in the pressure is observed indicating initial time, At burst the pressure returns to<br>
zero.<br>
8.	Record the bursting pressure (to nearest 0.1 kiloPascals (kPa)) and calculate the<br>

Example 3 - Evaluation of the effect of the microbicidal composition on condoms<br>
This investigation assesses the condom strength (using the Burst Test) of condoms lubricated with the microbicidal composition according to the present invention before and after ageing for 7 days at 70 °C.<br>
The condoms tested were: DF 53 N Thin, Batch no.: 0509052516 and the tests were conducted in S&amp;T, Shah Alam.<br>
Procedure<br>
1.	0.5g of the microbicidal composition containing 3% (w/w) of the active was dosed<br>
onto the external and internal surfaces of the condom (total: 1.0 g) and sealed in an<br>
aluminium foil (56 mm x 56 mm);<br>
2.	160 pcs of the condoms were prepared, 80 pcs were kept in an oven at 70 °C for 7<br>
days (aged) for an accelerated shelf life study and the balance 80 pcs were tested<br>
without ageing (unaged samples).<br>
3.	All of the unaged and aged sample were tested for Burst properties.<br><br>

Example 5 - Study to Assess the Effect of the microbicidal composition according to the present invention on HSV-2 Susceptibility<br>
5    Background<br>
The study was conducted to detect potential adverse effects of the microbicidal composition according to the present invention by measuring susceptibility of mice to infection with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), the virus that most commonly causes genital herpes.<br><br>
25<br>
The mouse HSV-2 vaginal transmission mode! is used by Richard Cone at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA, to assess toxicities associated with microbicides that could lead to susceptibility to pathogens such as HSV-2.<br>
Methods Mouse Model:<br>
Prior to the susceptibility assessment, female CF-1 mice (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN, USA) 6-8 weeks old are progestin treated (Depo Provera®, medroxyprogesterone acetate) to increase HSV-2 susceptibility, and to make the mice more uniform in terms of susceptibility than mice at different stages of the oestrous cycle.<br>
Viral Inoculum:<br>
Strain G of HSV-2, 5x108 TCID50/mL.<br>
Procedures:<br>
20 uL of the microbicidal composition according to the present invention was administered to the vagina followed 12 hours later by administration of a low-dose inoculum of HSV-2 (0.1 IDso) delivered in 10 uL of Bartels medium. Control animals received 20 |jL of PBS instead of test product.<br>
The inoculum is delivered 12 hours after application of the test product because previous experiments showed that this was the time at which peak susceptibility to HSV-2 infection occurred following administration of nonoxynol-9.<br>
In this study, a total of 40 mice received the microbicidal composition according to the present invention and a total of 40 mice received PBS.<br><br>
26<br>
Results<br>
Only 1 out of the 40 mice treated with the microbicidal composition according to the present invention became infected with HSV-li. In contrast, 7 out of 40 mice in the control group became infected. In other words, there was no increase in susceptibility following administration of the microbicidal composition according to the present invention.<br>
In previous studies, 29 out of 42 animals treated with nonoxynol-9, 20 out of 30 animals treated with microbicide ingredient 1, and 25 out-of 41 animals treated with microbicide ingredient 2, became infected.<br>
To determine relative susceptibility of the mice in previous studies, two groups of control mice were treated with PBS for every group of mice treated with test product. One control group was inoculated with 0.1 1D50, while the other was inoculated with 10 ID5o-The fraction of animals infected in each control group was then used to construct a dose-response graph (fraction infected vs. log ID), drawing a linear interpolation between the low and high dose points. The fraction of mice infected in the test group was then plotted on this graph to determine the effective ID of the low-dose inoculum in this test group. Relative susceptibility was defined as the effective ID the low-dose inoculum delivered to the test mice divided by the ID it delivered to the control animals.<br>
Animals treated with nonoxynol-9 were 29.7 times more susceptible to HSV-2 infection than the control animals (P
Conclusion<br>
The microbicidal composition according to the present invention does not appear to lead to increased susceptibility in the mouse-model of HSV-2 infection. Nonoxynol-9 and other detergent microbicides may lead to increased susceptibility.<br><br>
