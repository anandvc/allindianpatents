				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to apparatus and method to prevent recording of acceptable copy of video signals by modifying video copy protection signals in a RF domain, and pertains to the removal of copy protection signals from a video signal<br>
and, in particular, to a method and apparatus for disabling such copy protection signals by selectively modifying the envelope of an RF carrier signal which has been modulated by the copy protection signals. The invention is applicable in various embodiments for restoring the copiability of video signals which have been prerecorded in a recording medium, have<br>
-1A-<br><br>
been transmitted via satellite, are generated by a television camera, and/or are recovered via transmission over a television channel or cable system. The invention fiirther.relates.to.the modification of a RF earner signal, which is modulated by a standard video,signal which does not contain copy protection signals, to add copy protection signals to the RF carrier signal in the RF domain.<br>
To one skilled in the art of video engineering, video copy protection is defined as a system whereby a copy protected video signal is viewable with a minimum of or no visible artifacts whereby the playback of a recording of such a signal is not possible or produces a signal that has significantly degraded entertainment value. Copy protection is to be differentiated from video scrambling. Video scrambling means that the video signal is not viewable. A scrambled signal may be recordable, but unless it has been descrambled, the playback of such a recording is still unviewable.<br>
As evidenced by the above cross reference to related applications and patents, there are various techniques known in the art for not only inhibiting the making of acceptable video recordings, but also for defeating such copy protection techniques to allow the video signal to be recorded, that is, copied in'some manner.' That is; under certain 'circumstances; there is a need to disable the copy protection system to permit recording of copy-protected recordings, such as, for example, during authorized and permitted copying or for studio editing purposes. As may be derived from the above-mentioned references, there are several basic techniques typically applied to provide copy protection of recorded video signals as well as off-air or transmitted video signals. Likewise, there are several basic techniques typically applied to defeat or otherwise remove the various copy protection techniques used with any of the various sources of video signals.<br>
Exemplary of a copy protection technique is the subject matter of the U.S. Patents 4,631,603, 4,819,098.and-4i907i093-of;previous mention-in theXross ,Reference, the disclosures thereof being incorporated herein by reference, which concern modifying a video signal such that a television set produces normal video pictures from the modified signal, but a videotape recording made from the modified signal produces unacceptable pictures. These copy protection techniques rely on the addition of pseudo-sync signals, similar to the normal sync pulses, and/or the addition of high level positive pulses (hereinafter referred to as automatic gain control or AGC pulses) following the trailing edges of a percentage of the normal and pseudo-sync puises. Such copy protection signals are hereinafter also refeffed'to as "anti-copy pulses and/or signals."    The pseudo-sync<br>
-2-<br><br>
pulses, which extend from the blanking signal level to the normal sync tip level of the video signal, generally are added to the video signal during selected lines of the vertical blankins interval. Each of the pseudo-sync pulses may be followed by a respective high level AGC pulse of previous mention to provide pairs of pseudo-sync and AGC pulses which then are inserted at certain locations in the video signal, for example, in the vertical blanking interval or in the video lines immediately adjacent the vertical blanking interval. Copy protection is provided by the exaggerated voltage difference between the sync and/or pseudo-sync tip and the respective high AGC pulse level which, in turn, causes the automatic .gain control (AGC) system in, for example, a videotape recorder or record VCR, to make an erroneous assessment of the video signal level. It follows that the AGC system produces a gain correction which results in reducing the signal recorded on videotape to a prohibitively low level. Thus, during playback of such a recording, the resulting recovered video signal will generate unstable pictures of unacceptably poor quality on a normal television set.<br>
A further example of a copy protection technique is disclosed in the U.S. Patent No. 4,577,216 of previous mention in the Cross Reference, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference, and which concerns modifying a color video signal, such that a -television set produces a normal color picture while a videotape recording of the modified color video signal exfiitfits annoying color interference in the form of "horizontally arranged color bands, hereinafter referred to as a "color stripe" effect. Such a color stripe effect also is considered to be, and is referred to herein as "anti-copy pulses or signals" or copy protection signals. To this end, the color burst signal integral with the video signal is phase modulated in any of various manners such as, tor example, by a random, or pseudo-random noise signal, to produce a modified color burst signal having deliberate phase errors. It follows that the circuitry of a television set inherently ignores such phase modulation to produce an acceptable color picture, but the velocity error, or color stabilizer, correction circuit in a VCR will attempt to correct the introduced phase errors, as is disclosed in the above patent 4,577,216. As discussed therein, the velocity error correction circuit will cause the error to be transferred from the color burst signal to the chrominance signal of the video signal, thereby causing severe and objectionable color noise, that is, the color stripe effect, in the video color picture.<br>
Exemplary of techniques for defeating..or removing the. effects of the copy protection systems of previous discussion above, are those disclosed in the U.S. Patents 4,695,901, 5,157,510 and 5,194,965 of previous mention in the Cross Reference, and<br>
-3-<br><br>
whose disclosures are incorporated herein by reference. The subject matters of these references are concerned with defeating or disabling the copy protection techniques of previous discussion which employ pseudo-sync and/or AGC pulses as anti-copy signals to inhibit copying of the. .video, signal To this end, the pseudo-sync and/or AGC pulses effectively may be removed or disabled by first determining the timing locations of the anti-copy pulses and then by level shifting, narrowing the width or otherwise increasing the' frequency content, and/or by attenuating, replacing or otherwise modifying, at least some of the pulses by an amount that causes the VCR circuit to fail to respond to the anti-copy pulses "which provide the copy protection. The AGC pulses may be removed by replacing them with another selected signal or by selectively blanking the video signal during predetermined time periods following the occurrence of sync pulses. Further, removal of pseudo-sync pulses may be accomplished by selectively clipping the negative-going pseudo-sync pulses in response to the detection of the pulses. Accordingly, such copy protection removal techniques contemplate various means which replace, suppress or otherwise modify the video signal such that, because of characteristics of a VCR, the anti-copy signals become less effective or are nullified to no longer prevent unauthorized copying.<br>
Typical of techniques for defeating or removing the copy protection systems which generate the color stripe effect, are those disclosed in the U.S. Patent 4,626.890 and copending U.S. application Serial No. 08/438,155, filed May 9, 1995 of previous mention in the Cross Reference, and whose disclosures are incorporated herein by reference. The techniques disclosed., in the latter patent and application rely on first determining the video line locations containing the color stripe bursts, either from prior analysis and programming in location to, for example, a programmable memory, or by sensing each color burst which contains a color stripe on a line-by-line basis using, for example, a phase detector circuit. Secondly, the references are concerned with defeating the color stripe effect by replacing the modulated color burst signal with a regenerated color burst subcarrier component, modifying the color stripe burst or otherwise modifying the video signal (for example, modifying the horizontal sync pulse preceding the color stripe burst), eliminating some of the color stripe bursts, attenuating the color stripe bursts in amplitude or duration, and/or removing, phase shifting or attenuating a portion of each color stripe burst or most of the color stripe bursts. Alternatively, the color burst signal, and thus any color stripe burst, can be replaced throughout the active television field with respective correct color burst signals, which thus permits subsequently recording an acceptable copy.<br>
-4-<br><br>
As may be seen bv review of the above related references, the techniaues and apparatus for providing copy protection as well as the techniques and apparatus for defeating the anti-copy signals of the copy protection systems, all operate in the baseband video domain using-feasebaFHi-vifieo-sigrtais-Ee-derjve the anti-copy pulses. Furthermore, the selected modifications of the anti-copy pulses, including the color stripe effect, to disable the copy protection .systems to thereby allow the making of acceptable video signal recordings, also are performed in the baseband .video domain.<br>
The techniques for defeating copy protection in the baseband domain have the disadvantage of requiring the use of two separate leads containing an audio and a video signal, respectively, whereas the KF carrier based system of the present invention for defeating copy protection techniques requires a single lead carrying the RF carrier signal corresponding, for example, to a luminance signal. Further, when defeating copy protection signals in an off-air, cable, etc., environment, a copy protection defeating system in the baseband domain requires the added complexity of a tuner demodulator circuit to permit a recordable copy, whereas the RF carrier domain system does not.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides an alternative method and apparatus for disabling the anti-copy pulses and/or the color stripe effect copy protection signals of previous discussion above. To this end, the invention operates in the RF domain rather than in the baseband video domain as is the case in the copy protection techniques and the copy protection disabling techniques discussed above. More particularly, the invention contemplates several methods and apparatus' for disabling the pseudo^sync, AGC and/or color stripe anti-copy signals using signal detection and signal modification techniques involving RF carrier signals modulated by the copy protection signals'. The~invention also contemplates the insertion of such copy protection signals onto a RF carrier signal in the RF domain.<br>
An example of the present invention includes means for detecting or demodulating the RF carrier signal wnichls modulated by the copy protection signals. A pulse coincident with each color burst is derived from the demodulated or detected signal, which provides the location of the copy protection signals throughout the video field,,includ.ingjh e  vertical blanking interval. Alternatively, the pulse coincident with the RF modulating color burst can be derived via a bandpass filter and one-shot multivibrator.   Since the last color burst<br>
-5-<br><br>
occurs just before the start of the vertical blanking interval, it can be used to locate additional associated pulses in the vertical blanking interval, in which the anti-copy signals are embedded. The derived pulses then are used as timing control signals which time the operation of a respective one of various RF carrier modifying means in accordance with the invention combination. Each modifying means perform a modification, replacement, etc., o'f the anti-copy signals in the detected lines, which sufficiently disables the asspdated copy protection to allow the subsequent recording of an acceptable copy of the respective video signal.<br>
In a copy protection system utilizing pseudo-sync and/or AGC anti-copy pulses for modulating the RF earner, the RF carrier modifying means may comprise ^apparatus and method thereof for attenuating,4urjpiessing,.level shifting,-etc.,JheAntiTcopy signals, when, demodulated. Another modifying means in the RF domain includes effectively narrowing the anti-copy pulse modulation-envelope .via ^suitable attenuation, and/or by adding or subtracting the RF carrier, whereby, subsequent demodulation of the modified anti-copy signals in for example a VCR, proceeds normally to permit an acceptable recording. For example, the depth of modulation of the copy protection signals may be selectively altered to remove their affect. A further modifying means provides for effectively replacing the modulated RF carrier signal with another selected RF carrier or video signal and/or adding or subtracting a RF modifying signal to or from the modulated RF carrier signal to thereby replace, attenuate or distort the latter carrier signal with another signal or voltage level such that a recordable copy subsequently may be made.<br>
In a copy protection system utilizing the color stripe effect for modulating the color burst RF carrier, the RF carrier modifying means may comprise means for altering and/or narrowing the depth of modulation of the modulated color stripe burst RF envelopes or for phase shifting the color stripe burst RF envelope to sufficiently correct the color burst phase so that it is properly demodulated when subsequently recorded. A further modifying means includes means for regenerating the RF carrier of the respective television channel, and means for regenerating the sideband frequency formed of the carrier frequency plus the color burst frequency as for example with a color burst phase lock loop which averages'out phase errors in the color stripe burst. The two regenerated RF signals then are summed in the RF""domain""to~produce"*a correct RF modulating color subcarrier signal. This color subcarrier signal in the RF domain then is used to replace the original RF modulating color stripe signal during the intervals of the color stripe anti-copy signals in response to the<br>
-6-<br><br>
timing control signals of previous mention, to thereby defeat or weaken the color stripe effect in a subsequent recording process.<br>
A further modifying means for disabling the color stripe effect in the RF domain is to apply means for mixing or heterodyning the color stripe burst modulation with a phase shifted harmonic of the sideband frequency (the RF carrier plus the color burst frequency), followed by means for low pass filtering, to disable the effects of the color stripe bursts. Alternatively, the frequency of the modulated RF carrier corresponding to the copy protection signals may be modified to provide a frequency which is outside the normal frequency band, whereby the tuner in a record VCR will not respond sufficiently to allow the copy protection signals to be effective.<br>
Examples of the various methods and circuits for defeating the copy protection systems in the RF domain in accordance with the present invention, are fully described in the following detailed description. The addition of such copy protection signals in the RF domain is also described.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an   apparatus;<br>
for disabling copy protection signals added in blanking intervals<br>
of selected video lines of an associated video signal to prevent the recording of an acceptable copy of the video signal, comprising:<br>
means receiving the video signal for supplying a RF carrier signal which is modulated by the copy protection signals;<br>
means receiving the modulated RF carrier signal for producing a timing control signal indicative of the timing location of the copy protection signals; and<br>
means responsive to the timing control signal for modifying in a RF domain said copy protection signals or portions thereof during their presence in the modulated RF carrier signal, to sufficiently disable the copy protection signals when subsequently demodulated to permit the recording of acceptable copies of the associated video signal.<br>
&gt;7-<br><br>
According to the present invention, there is also provided a<br>
method of removing in an RF domain the effects of copy protection signals<br>
added in blanking intervals of selected video lines of a video signal to prevent a recording of an acceptable copy of the video signal, comprising:<br>
providing from the video signal a sole RF earner signal which contains the copyprotection signals embedded therein in said selected video lines thereof;<br>
producing from the RF carrier signal a timing control signal indicative of the presence of the copy protection signals; and<br>
modifying in the RF domain the copy protection signals during their occurrence in the RF earner signal, wherein the step of modifyingcompnses selectively altering in response to the timing control signal the RF carrier signal during the occurrence of said copy protection signals, such, that the copy protection signals are sufficiently disabled when subsequently demodulated to allow the recording of an acceptable copy of the video signal.<br>
It would be appreciated that the applicant has no intention of practicing the method and apparatus according to the instant invention for disabling, i.e., modifying, copy protection signals, and has no intention of manufacturing and/or selling "black boxes" capable of doing so. What is sought to be covered is a disabling method and apparatus, as disclosed and claimed, to prevent the illegal use of such "black boxes".<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS As previously mentioned, it is to be understood that video copy protection is defined as a sy s^ejn whereby a copy protected video signal is viewable with a minimum of or no visible artifacts, whereby the playback of a recording ctf such a signal produces a signal that has significantly degraded entertajnment value. Corjy protecdonjs tp be differentiated from the process of video scrambling wherein the video signal is not viewable. A scrambled signal may be recordable, but unless it has been descrambled, the playback of such a recording is still unviewable.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates the basic combination of the present invention for disabling copy protection signals embedded In a vi3eo~signal "to inhibit the copying thereof, wherein the invention performs in tfie"RF domain (for example in a dual VCR for RF to RF dubbing) rather than in the baseband video domain typically employed in the prior art of previous discussion. FIG. 1 includes circuitry illustrating the application of an RF carrier modulated by a composite video signal in which the copy protection signalsjxejnodulated.onto the RF carrier to prevent copying The FIG. 1 also illustrates, the extraction of the signal component containing the copy protection signals, which signal comppnent is the signal employed herein in the de scription to describe the various.means of the invention for disabling the copy protection signals.  In all of the figures, similar components and signals are similarly numbered and/or labeled.<br>
As depicted in the FIG. 1, a RF carrier.signal^modMlaled^y a^ompqsite yideo signal and containing copyprotection signals, is supplied on a lead 8 to a luminance RF carrier bandpass filter (BPF) 10 and to a chrominance RF carnerj3PF II via a suitable amplifier 9. The latter BPF 1l supplje s a chrominance signal to a summing circuit 12 via a conventional color processor circuit 13 The chrominance signal path is illustrated herein to shov/"tKejnannec in .which the color signal is reassembled with the RF carrier signal in<br>
-8-<br><br>
which the copy protection signals have been removed or otherwise defeated in accordance with the invention, to provide a RF carrier with modulating composite video signal or an output lead 14<br>
The RF carrier signal containing some form of modulating copy protection signals such as discussed above, is supplied via the luminance BPF 10 and a lead 15 to a demodulator circuit 16 which may be an FM, AM or other type of demodulator commensurate with the modulated RF carrier signal. Thus, an RF carrier signal supplied by a playback VCR or satellite transmissionJs a ^frequency^ modulated, signal, .while a RF carrier signal from a television channel or cable, that is, off-air, is an amplitude modulated signal.- Circuits 11 and 13 are generally used for VCR RF to RF dubbing process of previously mentioned.<br>
To illustrate, FIG. 1A exemplifies a waveform of a television line including a vertical blanking interval (VBI) arid depicting an RF carrier signal of, for example, 61.25 megahertz (MHz), which is the broadcast frequency for channel 3 used hereinafter in the description of some of the invention embodiments, wherein the RF carrier signal is amplitude modulated by  a  yjdgo^igna| usjng, ffl this   instance,   a negative modulation process. It follows that the peak white value of the video signal minimizes the RF carrier signal while the sync tip value maximizes the RF carrier signal, as depicted in the FIG. 1A. It is this RF carrier signal, modulated by given copy protection signals such as, for example, those disclosed in the patents referenced.above, ..that Js.utiljzedjn accordance wkh,the invention in the RF domain to defeat the effect of the copy protection signals.<br>
Similarly, FIG. IB exemplifies a television line waveform with a VBI, depicting an RF carrier signal which is frequency jn^dulatejOy a YJdep signal, such as supplied by a playback VCR^jatellite transmission, etc. As depicted, the sync period is represented by a 3.4 MHz frequency, the blanking level by 3.7 MHz frequency and Geakjvhite level by 4.4 MHz frequency. As mentioned above,,the RF jcarxier signjUJs utilized in the invention combination to detect and defeat the modulating copy protection signal in the RF domain.<br>
FIG. 1C illustrates a typical RF frequency spectrum of an amplitude modulated video signal on the picture or visual RF carrier frequency of 61.25 MHz, in this example as shown in Fig. 1 A. The~modulating chroma signal is 3.58 MHz above the picture RF carrier frequency and thus is 64.83 MHz. The modulated aural RF carrier is 4.5 MHz above the picture RF carrier and thus is 65.75 MHz.<br>
-9-<br><br>
FIG. ID illustrates a RF frequency spectrum of a typical frequency modulated recording system (FIG. IB) such as supplied, for example, .for a yHS or Beta video recorder. TKe"IunTinance signal is depicted and the sy^ic^rj oj[jJTe baseband^yideo .signal is modulated to 3.4 MHz (VHS). The peak white,of.the.baseband yideo..signaijs modulated to 4.4 MHz (VHS). In essence, the recorder system is a voltage-to-frequency converter while the playback system is a frequency-to-voltage converter.   It is noted that the chroma<br>
signal of the baseband video signal centered around 3 J8 MHz is frequency, converted to a<br>
*" "	- II" '¦ -   i    ¦¦     '*" * °'  '-¦" ¦	¦*       '™-o,<br>
lower frequency of, for example, 629 kilohertz (KHz) and is recorded onto the medium.<br>
Continuing now with FIG. l^the.demo^ulaLed^baseband^yjdeo signal from the demodulator circuit 16 is supplied to a sync/burst detection/separation circuit 18 which generates verticaljsync.^y-sync)^ignals at vertical or field rate^ horizontal sync (H sync) signals at horizontal line rate, or color burst signals. The signal is supplied to a logic timing circuit 20 which supplies a timing control signal to a RF control circuit 22 on a lead 24. The original RF carrier signal with modulating copy protecti.on signals,JhatJs, antiIg.o.pyJ. pulses or color stripe signals, also is supplied to the RF control circuit 22 via the lead 15. The RF control circuit 22 is steered by the timing control signal on thelead 24 to selectively modify the mcorningjRF carrier signal  in one o£~various techni.ques Jn- accordance with the invention, such that the output RF carrier signal supplied to the summing circuit 12 via an output lead 26 no longer contains effective copy protection signals. That is, the anti-copy pulses or colojLStrip.e signa!s jave J?een remoyed  apd/or disabled to enable a subsequent acceptable recording of the respective video signal. As previously mentioned, the copiable luminance signal on lead 26 is combined with the chroma signal by the summing circuit 12 to provide the composite video signal without copy protection on the output lead 14. Various methods and circuits for performing the modification Jalhe RF carrier in accordance with the invention are illustrated and.disclosed with reference to the following FIGs. IE, 2-5.<br>
FIG. IE illustrates a system for defeating copy protection signals in the AM RF domain while further preserving the aural RF carrier portion of a modulated RF carrier signal if, as may happen, the aural RF carrier is degraded bythecopy protection defeating process. To this end, copy protected video that has AGC and pseudo sync/and or color stripe bursjLnEP.tection  signals is  amplitude modulated oruan^RiLcarrier^to provide, for example, the modulated RF carrier signal on lead 15 of FIG. 1. The signal is supplied to a line location/timing circuit 28, to a RF carrier processing circuitjg and to an aural RF<br>
-10-<br><br>
carrier BPF 30.  The line location/timing circuit 28 corresponds to the circuits 16,,]8,.20jof<br>
FIG. 1 and provides a timing control signal similar	to that on the jead24   The RF carrier<br>
processing circuit 29 is the equivalent of the RF control circuit 22 ofFIG 1, and combines with the circuit 28 of FIG. IE to sufficiently defeat the AGC and/or pseudo svnc and/or color stripe burst that has been modulated onto the RF carrier, as is fully described hereinbelow in FIGs. 2, 4, 5. Defeating the modulated copy protection signals may cause some degradation in the aural RF carrier portion of the RF carrier signal. To preserve the aural RF carrier, the band pass filter 30 is used to supply via a lead 31 just the aural RF<br>
carrier signal (FM audio 4.5 MHz above the visual carrier, for example) to a summing<br>
circuit 32.  The output of the processing circuit 29 on a lead 34 is a modulated video with<br>
defeated modulated copy protection signals but with a possibly degraded aural RF carrier. The output on lead 34 is supplied to an aural carrier notch filter 36. The output of filter 36 is RF modulated video on a lead 37 with the modulated copy protection signals defeated sufficiently, and with no, or little, aural RF carrier. The summing circuit 32 combines the RF carrier signals on leads 31, 37, to yield an output RF carrier signal on a lead 38 with program video and audio RF carriers intact but with modulated copy protection signals, defeated.<br>
It may be seen that circuits 30 and 36 are optional if audio quality in the  audio quality in the KF carrier signal supplied by the processing circuit 29 is adequate. Thus, the RF carrier signal on the lead 34 is analternative output for the RF carriersignal on the lead 38.<br>
The circuit of FIG. 1 further illustrates the means by which a video signal modulated RF carrier signal can be modified in the RF domain to add copy protection signals onto the RF carrier signal. To this end, the RF control circuit 22 of FIG. 1 may be used to ins^rx,as,,for"exampie^yrnodulating, RF carrier signals to replace or modify portions of the RF carrier envelope such that when the RF carrier signal on the lead 26 is demodulated, copy protection signals will.appear, to.prevent copying. Basically, the RF carrier signalon theJead J5 in, for example an AM system, is modulated with a video signal not containing copy protection pulses, and is supplied to the corresponding (AM) demodulator circuit'16 and the RF control circuit 22. The circuits 18 and 20 generate baseband copy protection signals on the lead 24 to modify the RF carrier envelope in the circuit 22. For instance, portions of the RF carrier signal are enhanced in amplitude to generate pseudo-sync signals modulating the coincident RF carrier, while portions of the RF^carrier signal-following this enhanced carrier amplitude-are diminished to generate AGC<br>
-11-<br><br>
pulses modulating the coincident RF carrier.   The RF carrier signal on the lead 26 then<br>
contains copy protection signals modulating an RF carrier.   Other copy protection signals<br>
such as, for example, the color stripe burst signals of previous discussion above   and<br>
 disclosed m the US. Patent No. 4,577,216 of previous mention, may be applied in a similar<br>
manner in the RF domain.	<br>
If FIG. 1 is an FM system, then the RF control circuit 22 will be used to modify the carrier frequency of the RF carrier signal on the lead 15, whereby portions of the RF carrier will be decreased in frequency to repesent pseudo-syncjjgnajs frequency modulating the coincident RF carrier, followed by portions of the RF carrier that are increased in frequency to represent AGC pulses frequency modulating the coincident RF,carrier.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates in further detail alternative embodiments of the invention of FIG. 1, which embodiments receive an RF carrier signal via a television transmission channel, that is off-air, or via a cable system, etc., which RF carrier signal has been, by way of example onhk^AM modulated to include copy protection signals which inhibit the copying of the respective video signal. In this example, the RF modulated carrier signal includes a carrier of 61.25 megajejtzXMHz) and an aural FM carriej signal gf65.75 MHz as depicted in FIG. 1C, as well as the copy protection signals. The modulated RF carrier signal with copy protection signals is supplied vjja a lead 40 to an amplifier 42, whose output is supplied via a lead 43 to an amplifier/AM detector/low pass filter circuit 44. The AM detector portion of the circuit 44 provides recovery of the baseband video signal, while the low pass filter at the output of circuit 447emoves'the residual visual carrier frequency from the baseband video signal. The resulting baseband video signaljs supplied to a sync separator circuit 46 which provides at its outputs a horizontal sync (H sync) signal or pulse and a vertical syncP(V 'sync)"signal "oTpulse: on respective leads 48,. JO. The H sync signal on lead 48 thus includes pseudo-sync anti-copy signals or pulses as well. Leads 48),50 are.- coupled to a logic timing circuit 52 which generates a signal indicative of the presence of the television lines which containThe copy protection signals. Thus, circuit 52 effectively comprises a line locator circuit which generates, for example, a low logic level on a~IeacT5T'"~* during anactive videoJjngjinjjyhich anti-copy signals are present which, in the example herein, are lines 10 through 20 in the vertical blanking interval. A high logic level is provided on the lead 54 during the presence of the normal sync and color burst signals in the vertical blanking interval as well as during the active television field. Lead 54 is coupled to a control input of a RF switch 56<br>
-12-<br><br>
By way of background, certain p ortions of a normal viewing field defined by a video signal typically are not used for defining the actual picture. More specifically, the horizontal scan lines immediately adjacent  to those portions of a video signal definina vertical blanking intervals are not used in typical television monitors or sets to define the picture. Therefore those signal portions immediately adjacent to vertical blanking intervals are also available in their entirety for the addition of copy protection signals. Thus, insofar as this invention is concerned, suchjignalj^ipnsare^jJso considered part of the vertical blanking intervals, and the term "vertical blanking interval" as used herein encompasses the same.<br>
The modulated RF carrier signal suppjied by the amplifier 42 also is supplied via the lead 43 to an aurajjRF carrier notch .filter, circuit 57- To thisend, lead 43 is coupled to a positive input of a RF differential amplifier 58 and to a filter network, formed of resistors 60, 62 inductor 64 and capacitor 66, which network thence is coupled to an inverting input<br>
of the RF differential amplifier 58.   The notch filter circuit 57 herein is used to prevent<br>
degrading the aural RF carrier while providing for the defeat of the copy protection signals<br>
used to modulate the RF carrier signal. The junction of the resistors 60, 62 is coupled to one terminal of the RF switch 56. A second terminal of the switch 56 is coupled to ground. The output of the RF differential amplifier 58 provides an output signal from the circuit of FIG. 2 on a lead 68, which output signal comprises^ RF carrier signalin which the copy protection signals have been attenuated and which thus can be supplied to a recording VCR to provide an acceptablecopy of the^yidep^signaL^<br>
To this end, the RF switch 56 is maintained in an off condition by the low logic level on the lead 54 during the active video lines J0^through20 when the copy protection signals are present. During this portion of the vertical blanking interval, the notch filter circuit 57 is active to thereby prevent degrading the aural RF carrier, while the videcrRf carrier signal envelope is severely attenuated in the line intervals when the RF carrier modulating anti-copy signals are present. The attenuated RF carrier is supplied as the output signal on the lead 68. During the video lines and the active television field when the copy protection signals are absent, the RF switch 56 is coupled to ground via a high logic level on lead 54 to disable the notch filter circuit 57. During this interval, the original RF carrier signal onjeadjnjs supplied as the output of the RF. differential amplifier 58 on the lead 68. Thus, combining the two signals provides a modified or re-assembled video modulated RF carrier signal without the anti:copyj,signalsj,when demodulated subsequently<br>
-13-<br><br>
as, for example, by a record VCR. It may be seen that, in this embodiment oftheinvention. the RF envelope is attenuated when the copy  protection signals are present without affecting the aural RF carrier signal that is at a frequency of about 4.5 MHz above the visual RF carrier frequency, which is an additional advantage of the above embodiment of FIG. 2.<br>
In an alternative technique employing in part the circuitry,in FIG.  2,j:he notch filter circuit 57 and RF switch 56 are dispe nsed with and thejnodulated RF carrie£ signal on the lead 43 is supplied (via a dashed line^portion) to an input of a RF voltage control amplifier or modulator 70. The line location, i.e., timing control, signal from the logic timing circuit 52 is supplied via the lead 54 (and a dashed line portion) to a control input of the RF modulator 70. Thus, during the active video lines, for exarrffJe^iinesJ£--2Q^.ihe yertical blanking interval, the peak envelope of the anti-copy signals modulating the RF carrier may be suppressed via the RF modulator 70lrTrespo7iSe~T;oTrie signal on the lead 54. It follows"" that a re-assembled RF carrier signal is provided on an output lead 72 via an amplifier 74 in which the copy protection signals are disabled. In this embodiment, the aural~RF"carrier~ signal may be somewhat attenuated during suppression or attenuation of the RF jtnyelope of the anti-copy signals. However, the aural RF carrier signal should still be sufficient in amplitude to not cause momentary losses of the audio signal, i.e., audio "drop outs".<br>
In a further alternative technique employing in part the circuitry of FIG. 2, the notch filter circuit 57, the RF switch 56 and/or the RF modulator 70 are dispensed with and the modulated RF carrier ^CTaLoniead^Xig g.upplied,(via a dashed faejjortion) to an input terminal of a RF switch 76. A second RF source such as a RF carrier modulated by a noisy color signal, a RF carrier modulated by a color bar signal, an unmodulated RF carrier or a modulated RF carrier or other signal without sufficient anti-copy signals, is supplied via a lead 78 to a second terminal of the RF switch 76. The second replacement signal may in fact be no signal at all, including an RF signal of sufficiently low value which likewise induces a dropout during the peridd.of.tb.e^go.rjy.BEQtection^signals, which effectively blanks them out. In this alternative, the line location signal on the lead 54 is supplied to the RF switch 76 as a switch timing control signal,  whereby the modulated RF carrier signal on lead 43 is replaced during the period of the copy protection signals with one of the selected RF signals on lead 78 which lacks any copy protection signals. The resulting re-assembled output signal on an output lead 80 of the RF switch 76 thus does not contain anti-copy signals whereby acceptable recordings can be made of the video signal.   Alternatively, an<br>
-14-	<br><br>
aural band pass filter 79 and summing junction S1 may be employed to provide the aural RF carrier "on the lead 78 from the lead 40 (as shown in a dashed line portion) so that there is no disruption in the aural RF carrier on output lead 80 when the RF switch 76 switches from the RF carrier signal on lead 43 to therepjacement carrier signal on lead 78.<br>
As previously discussed, the techniques and circuitry of FIG. 2 provide timing and modifying means operatmg~in tHe~RF~olorna'n for disabling copy protection signals previously embedded in a video signal using, in this instance, an AM recording process such as commonly done, for example, in an off-air video transmission or cable transmission system.^'<br>
Referring to FIGs. 3A, 3B, the techniques and circuitry provide means operating in the RF domain for similarly disabling copy protection signals, but in a video signal derived via a FM recording system such as, for example, a dual deck videotape recorder system (i.e., VCR) employing"RF to RF dubbing, or via a satellite system, etc. To this end, in FIG. 3A a luminance RF carrier signal which"" is'frequency moduIatecT(FM) is supplied to a preamplifier/equalizing amplifier circuit 90 via an input lead 92 and thence to a limiter" ampIifier/FM detector circuit 94. The resulting baseband videb^ignal~is supplied* to a lowpass filter/de-emphasis circuit 96 wherein the signal irtfUtered~ancI"Tle=remphasized"to~ provide a baseband video luminance demodulated signal for input to a sync separator . circuit 98 and to provide the luminance demodulated signal on a lead 10(1 The. sync separator circuit supplies a composite H sync with anti-copy pseudo-sync signals via a lead l"027ancTa V sync signal via a lead 104.<br>
The composite H and pseudo-sync signal is supplied to a non-retriggerable one-shot multivibrator 106 of about 50 microseconds, which supplies a pulse to an AND gate 108 which begins at the trailing edge of H sync and extends to the end of an active horizontal television line. Thus, the non-retriggerable one-shqtj 1.0£ prpvides a signal which is indicative of the presence of active television line pixels. The one-shot 106 also ignores triggering on the anti-copy pseudo-sync pulses. The V sync signal is supplied to a orie-sKoT 110 of about 6 television lines duration, a^^thMcVto^an^th^frgne::sri5t"TT2 of abtfuTl'D television lines duration which generates a vertical rate pulse that is, for example, logic high from television lines 10 through 20 andTHus~is a^logic high during the presence of RF carrier modulated by the anti-copy pulses in the lines. The output of one-shot 112 is siippHedlS'the AND gate ruewKich provides a line locator signal, via a lead 114 that is a<br>

Referring to FIG. 3B, the luminance demodulated signal on lead 100 (FIG. 3A), is supplied to a video clamping circuit 116, which clamps the luminance signal to sync tip voltage and supplies the signal to one terminal of a switch 118. The other terminal of the switch 118 is grounded. The line locator signal on the lead 114 from FIG. 3A is used to control the switching of the switch 118. The output of switch 118 is coupled to an inverting input of a comparator amplifier 120 and a non-inverting input of a comparator amplifier 122. The non-inverting and inverting inputs of comparator amplifiers 120, 122, respectively, are coupled to threshold voltages Vbl and Vb2. In response to the line locator signal on "lead 114, a clamped luminance signal is supplied to the comparator amplifiers 120, 122 during the presence of pseudo-sync aiii^ AGC pulses. Amplifiers 120, 122 in turn, generate logic high levels PS and AGC coincident with the RF carrier modulating pseudo-sync (PS) and AGC pulses, respectively,"and output the corresponding logic signals on respective leads 124, 126, as well as to one input of respective AND gates * 128, 130. The voltages Vbl and Vb2 are selected commensurate with the sync tip voltage level and the AGC pulse voltage level, respectively. The PS and AGC logic signals also are supplied to pulse narrowing circuits 132, 134 respectively, each formed of resistors coupled to second inputs of respective AND gates 128, 130 and capacitors coupled from respective second inputs to ground. The AND gates 128, 130 supply^narfo'wed"pulse~width logic signals NPS and NAGC fronvthe respe'ctive PS and AGC signals, on leads 136, 138.<br>
It is to be understood that the AGC anti-copy pulses alternatively may be clustered at selected timing positions along the "back porch" of the vertical blanking interval such as " described in the U.S. Patent No. 4,819,098 of previous mention, and that the present invention further contemplates the defeat of such clustered copy protection modifications to the video signal.<br>

The PS signal causes a pulse level shifting or attenuation affect while the NPS signals causes a pulse narrowing effect. Likewise, if the control signal AGC on lead 126 or NAGC on lead 138 are used along with the line locator signal on lead 114 to control the RF switch 142 via the logic combining circuit 140, the luminance RF carrier signal on lead 144 is replaced by a frequency which produces AGC pulses of attenuated amplitude or AGC pulses of narrowed pulse width, respectively, when demodulated in a record VCR or satellite tuner. Thus, the line locator signal on lead 114 is used to switch a RF signal into the luminance RF carrier signal to thus replace the portions ofjhe television jmes^containinQ; RF carrier modulating anti-copy signals with any active television line signal which would render recordable copies of the video signal when FM detected subsequently in a dubbing process.

FIG. 4 depicts analternative embodjment of the invention for removing copy protection signals^from^a^corjy protectedjno^ulatgdJ^ camer signjU,using techniques in the RF domain. To this end, a modulated RF carrier signal such as derived from off-air via a television channel, cable system, etc., wherein the RF carrier has been AM modulated to include copy protection signals, is suppjje^d,to apC,i:e storation,circuit 170 viaa lead 172. The circuit 170 includes a capacitor 174, a resistor 176 and a diode 178 coupled at a common junction and thence to a non-inverting input of a comparator amplifier 180. The free ends of the resistor 176 and diode  17p.are coupled to. a sup.pjy. voltage and to ground, respectively. The DC restoration circuit 170 thus DC restoresjhe RF.envelopg to its peak value, i.e., the sync tip RF envelope value. The restored RF carrier signal is supplied to the comparator amplifier 180 which slices the peak RF just below its maximum as established by a threshold voltage Vth applied via a lead 182 to an inverting input of comparator amplifier 180. The comparator amplifier 180 supplies a burst of RF, coincident with the H sync and V sync which modulateJhe^RF carrier signal, to a low pass filter 184. The filter 184 filters out the RF components to supply a baseband composite sync signal including H sync, V sync and pseudo-sync signals to a logic timing circuit 186 and to a second low pass filter 188, via a lead 187. The filter 188 retrieves the V sync signal and supplies it to the logic timing circuit 186 via a lead 189. The latter circuit 186 generates on a lead 190 a timing location or timing control signal which identifies the location of the video lines and associatedjlF carrier modulating anti-copy signals, i.e., the pseudo-sync and AGC pulses.<br>

In an alternative modification to FIG. 4, the low pass filter to retrieve the.composite H and pseudo-sync pulses can be replaced by using instead^ one-shot multivibrator timing circuit to trigger a pulse at the output of the comparator amplifier 180. Furthermore,-Ti£,the, copy protected modulated RF carrier is large in signal level, the comparator amplifier ISO can be replaced by a diode or transistor to perform partial RF envelope or power detection to effectively achieve the results of the amplifier 180.<br>
FIG. 4A illustrates further details of the logic/timing circuit 186 of FIG. 4, wherein similar components are similarly numbered and labeled. Thus, the V sync signal from the low pass filter 188 (FIG. 4) is supplied via the lead 189 to a one-shot multivibrator 200 and thence to an AND gate 202 vfa a secona^n^SnUt'TnultivibTator 2047""CJcewise, the composite sync signal from the low pass filter l^TTTG. 4) is suppfieTviirtfie lead 187 to a one-shot multivibrator 206 and thence to the AND gate 202. The one-shots 200,104 amT 206 have time durations of about 6 television lines, about 10 television lines and 50 microseconds, respectively. The one-shot 206 is triggered by the trailing ecTge'oFeacn fT sync pulse but is immune to the edge of pseudo-sync pulses. The signal from the one-shot 204 comprises vertical rate pulses indicative of active television lines 10 through 20 modulating the RF carrier, while the signal from the one-shot 206 is indicative of the active television line pixels modulating the RF carrier. An output lead 208 from the AND gate 202 provides a line locator signal formed of logic high pulses which are coincident with the AGC and PS pulses but not necessarily with normal H sync pulses modulating the RF<br>

carrier. The line locator signal on the iead 208 is indicative of active television line pixels in or adjacent to the vertical blanking interval for fines TO through 20 containing-fche-antimony pulses. As may be seen, the components 200-206 are similar to the components 106-112 of FIG. 3 A, and the line locator signal on lead 208 is similar to the line Jocator^signaKon.the lead 114 and is used for similar purposes.<br>
The composite sync signal, with PS pulses, also is supplied to an AND gate 210, and the line locator signal on the lead 208 is supplied to the AND gate 210 as well as to a logic combining circuit 212. "The AND gate 210 supplies logic high pulses coincident with PS pulses on a lead 214, and also provides an input to a one-shot multivibrator 216 of 3 microseconds duration, which then supplies pulses coincident with AGC pulses on a lead 218. The PS and AGC logic level pulses on leads 214, 218 are supplied as timing signals to the logic combining circuit 212 along with the line locator signal on lead 208. The logic combining circuit 212 supplies the timing control signal of previous description in FIG. 4 on the lead 190, which signal is coincident with the RF carrier modulated by AGC and PS pulses in the associated television lines.<br>
FIG. 4B depicts an example of the depth of modulation circuit 192 of FIG. 4, which example depicts a switching circuit 230 that enables changing the depth of RF carrier modulation of the incoming modulated RF carrier signal containing copy protection, which is supplied via the lead 172 of the FIG. 4. To this end, the AGCP signal on lead 218 of FIG. 4A is supplied to control the switching circuit 230 such that the regenerated continuous wave RF (visual) carrier signal on lead 198 of FIG. 4, preferably including the aural RF carrier from the signal on the lead 172, is gated into the modulated RF carrier signal during the time that modulated AGC pulses are present in the former signal. Thus, the switching circuit 230 "fills in" the RF carrier which is pinched off by the modulating anti-copy AGC pulses. The resulting RF carrier signal on the output iead 196 of previous mention in FIG. 4, has a reduction in the depth of modulation during the period of the RF carrier modulated by AGC pulses. It follows that in a subsequent recording process of the respective video signal, the altered or suppressed AGC pulses allow the recording of an acceptable copy. Alternatively, the signal on lead 198 can be the aural RF carrier only, whereupon the output signal on the lead 196 contains blanked or attenuated visual RF carrier during the period that the RF carrier modulating copy protection signals are present in the RF carrier signal on the lead 172.<br>
-20-<br><br>
FIG. 4C depicts an alternative example of the depth of modulation circuit 192 of PlG. 4, which is similar to the example of FIG. 4B but which utilizes the PS signals instead of the AGC signals to disable the RF carrier modulating anti-copy pseudo-sync signals providing the copy protection. To this end, the modulated RF carrier signal on the lead 172, FIG. 4, is supplied to a summing circuit 234 of FIG. 4C. The regenerated continuous wave RF carrier signal on the lead 198, FIG. 4, is supplied to an inverter 236 and thence to one input terminal of a switching circuit 238. The other input terminal of switching circuit 238 is coupled to ground, and switching control is provided by the PSP signal on the lead 214 of FIG. 4 A, The output of the switching circuit 238 is coupled to a second input of the summing circuit 234, and supplies thereto an inverse phase visual RF carrier signal which is regenerated or derived during the time interval of the RF carrier is modulated by pseudo-sync signals. This inverse carrier signal is combined with the modulated RF carrier signal on lead 172 by the summing circuit 234. The resulting re-assembled RF carrier signal on the output lead 196 (also FIG. 4) has reduced peak carrier levels for pseudo-sync pulses such that, when subsequently detected by the associated circuitry in, for example, a VCR, the reduced pseudo-sync pulse amplitudes allow the making of an acceptable recording. The circuit of FIG. 4C also preserves the aural RF carrier signal during the switching process of the switching circuit 238 in response to the PSP on lead 214.<br>
In an alternative to the PS pulse suppression technique of previous description in FIG. 4C, if the pulse widths of the pseudo-sync pulses of the output of the AND gate 210 on the lead 214 are narrowed instead, then when the PSP signal is applied to control the switching circuit 238, FIG. 4C, the anti-copy pseudo-sync pulses of the modulated RF carrier output on lead 196 likewise are narrowed. The result is that the narrowed pseudo-sync pulses are not detectable by a subsequent VCR whereby an acceptable recording is permitted.<br>
FIG. 4D depicts another alternative example of the depth of modulation circuit 192 of FIG, 4. This circuit reduces the peak modulation(even to about zero carrier amplitude) of the PS pulses and/or reduces the depth of modulation of the RF carrier envelope coincident with the AGC pulses by way of an RF modulating, that is, a gain control, technique. In addition, the circuit of FIG, 4D also may be used to reduce the overall RF carrier modulation of either or both the AGC and pseudo-sync modulated RF envelope such that when demodulated or detected by, for example, a record VCR, results in a video signal  with  a  combination  of attenuated  and  level  shifted  pseudo-sync  pulses  with<br>
-21-<br><br>
attenuated AGC pulses relative to the program video during the active television field signal, which permits an acceptable recording. Alternatively,the depth of modulation circuit 192 may be used to remove the RF carrier signal during copy protection signal modulation as to allow a recordable copy.<br>
To this end, referring first to FIG. 4A, the inverted versions of the timing signals labeled line locator on lead 208 and PSP on lead 214, and the timing signal AGCP on lead 218, are supplied to the inputs of a summing amplifier 240 in FIG. 4D. The output of the summing amplifier 240 is supplied to an AM RF modulator circuit 242 along with the modulated RF carrier signal on the lead 172 (FIG. 4) which contains the RF carrier modulating anti-copy pulses. The summing amplifier 240 thus controls the gain of the RF modulator 242 in response to one of the signals input thereto on the leads 208, 214 and 218. More particularly, the line locator signal causes the attenuation and/or level shifting of pseudo-sync pulses when subsequently demodulated by, for example, a record VCR. The PSP signal causes reduced peak RF carrier in the output on lead 196 which permits copying during the subsequent pseudo-sync modulation by record VCR circuitry. Alternatively, application of the AGC pulses cause the RF carrier level to be at an increased carrier level during the AGC pulse modulation which, when detected by a tuner circuit of the record VCR, results in reduced AGC pulse amplitudes. Thus, use of the circuit of FIG. 4D results in the record VCR making an acceptable recording in which the copy protection signals have been disabled in accordance with the RF domain techniques of the invention.<br>
In an alternative RF domain technique, narrowing of the PSP and/or AGCP pulses supplied on leads 214,218 provides correspondingly narrowed RF carrier modulated by pseudo-sync and/or AGC pulses which, when demodulated by the record VCR, provide similarly acceptable recordings of the video signal. The narrowing of the PSP and/or AGCP pulses may be accomplished as depicted, for example, in FIG. 3B.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates a further embodiment of the invention, which embodiment provides means operating in the RF domain for disabling copy protection provided by the color stripe effect of previous discussion, wherein the color burst integral with a video signal is phase modulated in some manner to prevent acceptable copying. Referring to the block diagram, a modulated RF carrier signal, containing color stripe copy protection signals, is supplied via an input lead 250 to a detector circuit 252 for detecting an RF carrier modulated by color burst, to a RF carrier regeneration circuit 254, to a phase lock loop (PLL) 256 for providing a RF carrier with modulating color burst, and to one input<br><br>
terminal of a RF switching circuit 258. The modulated RF carrier signal is supplied from off-air via a television channel, a cable system, etc., and in this example is derived from channel 3. The RF burst detector (i.e. at 64.83 Mhz) is coupled via a lead 260 to a logic timing circuit 262 which thence provides a control signal to the RF switching circuit 258 via a lead 264. The lead 260 also is coupled as a control signal to the RF modulated by burst PLL 256. The output of the RF carrier regeneration PLL 254 is coupled to one input of a summing circuit 266 via a lead 268. The output of the RF modulated burst PLL 256 is coupled to a second input of the summing circuit 266 via a lead 270. The output of the summing circuit 266 is supplied via a lead 272 to a second input of the RF switching circuit 258, whose output supplies a RF carrier signal on an output lead 274 wherein the color stripe copy protection signal has been disabled thereby allowing the subsequent making of acceptable recordings. Accordingly, the circuit of FIG. 5 operates in the RF domain to provide a regenerated color burst modulated onto a RF carrier signal which, when demodulated, contains ineffective color stripe burst signals which have been sufficiently modified to permit the recording of an acceptable copy.<br>
The burst detector circuit 252 of FIG. 5 provides circuitry which derives a color burst (CB) control signal from the incoming RF modulated carrier on the lead 250 containing color stripe color protection modulated onto the RF carrier. To this end, FIG. 5A illustrates by way of example only, such a circuitry. The modulated RF carrier signal from, for example, the channel 3 broadcast station, is supplied on lead 250 to a bandpass filter (BPF) 280. In this example, the RF carrier of channel 3 has a frequency of 61.25 MHz modulated by the color burst frequency of 3.58 MHz (for the NTSC standard), whereby the modulated RF carrier signal on lead 250 has a frequency of 64.83 MHz. Thus, the BPF 280 filters out the RF carrier frequency of 61.25 MHz to extract via the BPF 280 onto a lead 281, a signal coincident with the RF carrier modulated by color burst but having a frequency of 64.83 MHz. This signal is supplied to a one-shot multivibrator 282 of, for example, 50 microseconds duration. The one-shot 282 triggers off the leading edge of the filtered 64.83 MHz signal and is immune to any color signal in the 64.83 MHz signal since the pulse duration of 50 microseconds extends the pulse the full time duration of an active television line. The signal output from the one-shot 282 thus contains only a 50 microsecond pulse triggered from the RF modulated by color burst. This latter signal is supplied to a one-shot multivibrator 284 of 2 microseconds duration which is triggered by the leading edge of the 50 microsecond pulse to provide a signal coincident with color burst<br>
-23-<br><br>
but at 64.83 MHz, which thus represents the timing location of the RF carrier modulated by color burst. Thus, the output of the one-shot 284 is a modulating burst location signal (BL) on the lead 260 (FIG. 5), which is unaffected by any other modulating chroma signal, is coincident with the RF carrier modulated by color burst occurrence, and which is used as a timing control signal to control the operation of the RF modulated by burst PLL 256, as described below. A similar BL signal may be derived from the composite sync signal on the lead 187 of FIG. 4, or from the H sync signal derived from the circuit 16 of FIG. 1.<br>
The burst location signal also is supplied via the lead 260 to the logic timing circuit 262 which provides a BL related timing control signal on the lead 264 for switching the switching means 258 in coincidence with the RF carrier modulating anti-copy color stripe signals contained in the modulated RF carrier signal. The circuit 262 may be simply a lead, or may be a logic circuit that derives a timing control signal which is coincident with the RF carrier modulated by color stripe bursts.<br>
In FIG. 5, the RF carrier regeneration PLL 254 includes a phase lock loop having a 61.25 MHz frequency matching the RF carrier frequency of the respective off-air television channel, which in this example is channel 3. If other channels and frequencies are used, then the frequencies of the various PLL circuits are selected accordingly. The signal provided by the PLL 254 on the lead 268 is a continuous wave (CW) RF carrier of 61.25 MHz which is supplied to the summing circuit 266 for combination with the output signal from the RF modulated by burst PLL 256.<br>
The RF modulated burst PLL 256 is illustrated in FIG. 5B in further detail, and includes in this example a gate circuit 286 which is coupled to the bandpass filtered signal on the lead 281, and is gated by the modulating burst location signal (BL) on the lead 260, FIGs. 5, 5A. The gate circuit 286 supplies a resulting gated burst modulation signal to a PLL 288 of 64.83 MHz frequency, which PLL 288 corresponds to the phase lock loop portion of the RF modulated by burst PLL 256 of FIG. 5. The PLL 288 supplies a color-burst modulated RF carrier continuous wave signal on the lead 270. Due to the inertia of the PLL 288, any color stripe phase errors modulated onto the RF carrier are removed by the averaging process of the PLL.<br>
As previously mentioned, the continuous wave RF carrier on the lead 268 is combined with the continuous wave color burst modulated RF carrier on the lead 270 by the summing circuit 266, to provide a RF modulated, color subcarrier continuous wave frequency on the lead 272, FIG. 5, which is supplied to the RF switching circuit 258.   In<br>
-24-<br><br>
response to the timing control signal on lead 264. the RF modulated, color subcarrier signal 'on lead 272 is inserted in the original modulated RF carrier signal which has color stripe copy protection, during the intervals that the color stripe modulation is present. Thus, the output lead 274 provides a RF carrier signal wherein the modulating color stripe copy protection signal is disabled, such that acceptable copies can be made subsequently, for example, by a record VCR.<br>
It is to be understood that although the description herein of the various embodiments of the FIGs. 1-5 illustrates the invention techniques as replacing or otherwise modifying all the cycles of the copy protection waveforms modulated onto the RF carrier signal, the invention further intends that only portions of the RF carrier modulating pseudo-sync and/or AGC pulses, or of the color burst, or only a selected number of the anti-copy signals, need be replaced or modified to provide the intended disabling of the copy protection in the RF domain. Thus, for example, in the techniques wherein the pseudo-sync and/or AGC anti-copy pulses are being replaced or otherwise modified, only a portion of the pseudo-sync and/or AGC pulses modulating the RF carrier signal need be modified. Alternatively, the modulating anti-copy pulses may be selectively narrowed such that they are not detectable subsequently by the VCR circuitry. Still further, only a selected number of the anti-copy signals may be replaced, altered, narrowed or otherwise modified to provide the same effect of disabling the anti-copy signals and thus the copy protection. Similarly, in the techniques wherein the RF carrier modulating color stripe effect provides copy protection, only a selected number of cycles of the subsequently demodulated waveform, or only a few lines containing color stripe copy protection, when demodulated, need be replaced or modified in the RF domain to cause similarly disabling the process in accordance with the invention. It should be known that varying the duty cycle(narrowing) and or frequency of the RF carrier during the copy protection signal modulation can also result in a recordable copy. This is analogous to the Quan et al United States Patent number 5,194,965. Also see pulse narrowing circuits such as FIG. 3B circuits 132 and 134. Also see frequency varying circuit such as in FIG 3B , circuit 154. Likewise, the amplitude' level of the RF carrier during modulation from the copy protection signals may be varied   (for example.even to cause an RF drop out) as to allow a recordable copy.<br>

-43-<br>
There is disclosed    an apparatus <br>
 for disabling copy protection signals added in blanking intervals<br>
of selected video lines of an associated video signal to prevent the recording of an<br>
acceptable copy of the video signal, comprising:<br>
means (8) receiving the video signal for supplying a RF carrier signal which is<br>
modulated by the copy protection signals;<br>
means (20) receiving the modulated RF carrier signal for producing a timing control<br>
signal indicative of the timing location of the copy protection signals; and<br>
means (24) responsive to the timing control signal for modifying in a RF domain said copy protection signals or portions thereof during their presence in the modulated RF carrier signal, to sufficiently disable the copy protection signals when subsequently demodulated to permit the recording of acceptable copies of the associated video signal.</td>
