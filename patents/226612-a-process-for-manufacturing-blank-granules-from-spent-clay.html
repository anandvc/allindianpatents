THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br>
1<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a process for manufacturing blank granules from spent clay.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Oil industries such as petroleum industries and other oil industries employ<br><br>
granular fuller's earth oil. The petroleum oil<br>
for processing oil for decolourisation and purification of the ncluding high viscous oil and low viscous oil including base oils, liquid paraffin, transformer oil, white oil, kerosene, and other petroleum oils to be processed is passed through the granular bed of fuller's earth. The oil percolates through the bed and the colour body in the oil adsorbs on the fuller's earth resulting in decolourisation and purification of oil. Once the bed of fuller's earth stops decolourising or purification of the oil, the used fuller's earth replaced by new granular fuller's earth. This used oil-laden fuller's earth is known as spent clay.<br>
The spent clay is generally in granular form and contains around 30% to 50% oil.<br><br>
Therefore, this clay is<br><br>
classified as hazardous waste in the world. This spent clay<br><br>
is either treated or disposed by land filling.<br><br>
The usual method o<br>
filling  of spent clay contamination of<br>
disposing of spent clay is through landfill. However, land causes environmental problems such as soil erosion, ground water, non-fertilization of the land, water logging etc. Further, the spent clay might ignite thereby as it contains entrained oil.<br>
Another method is to treat the spent clay in order to make it environmental friendly. The prior ar: discloses numbers of methods to accomplish this such as regenerating/reactivating and recycling of the spent clay by solvent extraction process, oxidation of spent clay and the like. An attempt has been disclosed in<br><br>
US Patent no. 5,942,457 which teaches a process of extracting oil by solvent extraction and further a reactivation step where the oil-free spent clay is treated with acid, and a thermal polishing step for acid-treated, solvent extracted spent clay.  This process is not economical as it utilizes expensive solvents for<br>
extractions.<br><br>
,627 a process is described wherein the mixture of spent<br>
suitable solvent to remove the bulk of oil and steaming to<br>
porous in presence of water and air. The process achieves the<br>
clay by oil extraction and further converting the spent in to<br>
851<br>
In US Patent No. 1, clay is treated with a make the mass<br>
regeneration of spent a usable product.<br>
Thus, all the above methods involve pretreatment, regeneration, post treatment<br><br>
and activation of the be used for refining t<br><br>
spent clay. Although, the regenerated spent clay can again ie oil, the use is for limited cycles. Finally, the regenerated<br><br>
spent clay is inefficient to regenerate and subjected to land filling.<br><br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br><br><br>
The present invention granules is shown in are shown in Fig 3 and<br>
utilizes known systems for the manufacturing blank ig 1 and 2 and the process steps of the present invention 4.<br><br><br>
Generally, spent clay clay in entrained form.<br>
from the refineries contains 30-50% oil of the volume of the According to the present invention, the spent clay is tested<br><br>
for its oil content and temperature range of the entrained oils to decide the<br><br>
process for manufac from the various oil<br>
uring blank granules from the spent clay as it is collected companies. Generally, the spent clay contains substantial<br>
amount of the low viscous oils having boiling temperature less than 300°C as the<br>
j maximum spent clay is produced by the refineries treating lube oil base stocks.<br>
According to the present invention, a process as shown in Fig 3 and system as shown in Fig 1 is employed for manufacturing the blank granules from the spent clay that contains substantial amount of the low viscous oil having boiling temperature less than 300°C and oil more than 15%. As shown in Fig 1, the system (100) consists a heating vessel (10), a stirrer (12) for stirring the spent clay, a condenser (20), a collector (30) for collecting evaporated oil and a rotary sieve (40) for sieving blank granules of required size. The known heating media such as high-pressure steam, oil, electricity or the like is used for heating the spent clay. As shown in Fig 1 and 3, the spent clay is charged in the vessel having arrangementjfor heating. The spent clay is heated for evaporating oil and<br>
5<br><br>
stirred occasionally to avoid bonding of the granules to each other. Once the temperature of the spent clay reaches the vaporization point of the oil, the oil starts vaporizing. The evaporated oil is condensed by passing through the condenser and condensed oil is collected in different fractions as entrained oil is mixture of various oils such as petrol, base oil, kerosene and the like. The time of heating depends upon on the nature of the oil and quantity of the oil present in the spent clay. The spent clay is heated at about 300°C at which the most of the oil vaporizes leaving behind the granular structure of the spent clay undamaged, as the main requirement of the use of the end product is granular structure and also oil when heatec above its flash point, a typical coating of carbonaceous material is formed on the surface of the spent clay that makes the clay hard and will not allow to disintegrate in water based solutions which is the main aim of the present invention. This heated clay after sieving is called as blank granules. The size of the sieve is used between 30-80mesh depending upon the requirement of the blank granules. The powder below the sieve is very less and non-hazardous. Therefore, the powder can be disposed by landfilling.<br>
The heated clay is tested for the oil content before sieving. If the heated clay consists of the oil, the heated clay is roasted/incinerate in the incineration before the sieving to evaporate/combusting the rest of the oil.<br>
Another process for manufacturing blank granules from the spent clay according to the present invent on is shown in Fig 4 and the system is shown in Fig 2. The<br>
system (200) comprises screw conveyers (210, 240) for charging the spent clay<br>
i i<br>
in the incinerator (220) and for charging combusted clay to a rotary sieve (230) for sieving the blank granules. According to present invention, this process is used only if the oil content in the spent clay is less than 15% or if the fuller's clay is used for the purification/decolourization of viscous oil or oil having boiling point<br><br>
more than 300°C. According to this process as shown in Fig 2 and 4, the clay is combusted in the incinerator till all the oil gets combusted with slow stirring. Maximum stirring speed is 60 rpm. Alternatively, the spent clay can be roasted in open hearth. While combusting, the oil forms a typical coating of the carbonaceous material over the surface of the clay that makes clay hard and will not allow disintegrating in the water-based solutions/water. This combusted/roasted cay is sieved to obtain the blank granules. The powder obtained is non hazardous and the quantity of the powder is little more than the powder obtained in ^he first process for the present invention as discussed above. This powder can be disposed by land filling.<br>
The blank granules obtained manufactured from the spent clay according to the process of the present invention have following properties:<br><br>
CHARACTERISTICS	<br>
Colour	Black<br>
Moisture Content	3% w/w<br>
Bulk density	0.8 to 1.1 gm/ml<br>
Acidity	Nil<br>
Liquid holding capacity	15-30% w/w<br>
According to the present invention, the blank granules of the present invention can be used as carrier for delivering pesticides, insecticides, Plant growth regulators, Bio-fertilizers, and Micronutrient to plants as the blank granules obtained by the process of the present invention are not disintegrable in the water or water based solutions and have good water holding capacity.<br>
The major advantages of the present invention are as follows:<br>
7<br><br>
(a)	Conversion of spent clay in to blank granules eliminates the need for spent clay disposal, which is very costly and difficult to achieve properly in compliance with strict environmental laws.<br>
(b)	Additional income resulting from the recovery of entrained oil in the spent clay.<br>
(c)	Reduction of v rgin clay consumption for the use as a carrier in agricultural industries.<br>
(d)	Contributes to a "Zero Waste" oil refining and re-refining process by getting rid of the last undesirable byproduct (spent clay) and its disposal problem by converting it into usable blank granules for delivering pesticides, insecticides, Plant growth regulators (PGR), and Bio-fertilizers.<br>
Example:	j<br>
Spent clay from M/s. Suryoday Blending Pvt. Ltd was taken. The oil content is measured by extracting oil with MEK (please provide Full form) from the spent clay. The oil content was 21.75gm in 100 gm spent clay. The 1000 gm spent clay is heated upto 300°C and evaporated oil is recovered. The weight of the recovered oil was 200 gm. The heated clay was sieved to obtain blank granules and weighed. The weight of the blank granule was 702 gm and the blank granules were tested in Laboratory. The results were as follows:<br><br>
