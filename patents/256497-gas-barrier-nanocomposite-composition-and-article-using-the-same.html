GAS-BARRIER NANOCOMPOSITE COMPOSITION AND ARTICLE USING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to a gas-barrier nanocomposite composition and an<br>
article manufactured therefrom, and more particularly, to a nanocomposite composition having superior barrier properties and moldability, which is formed by dry-blending a polyolefin resin with a melt blend of a resin having barrier properties and a nanocomposite having barrier properties and a compatibilizer, and a product manufactured therefrom.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	General-purpose resins, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, are used in many<br>
fields due to their superior moldability, mechanical properties, and moisture barrier properties. However, these resins are limited in their use in packaging or containers for agrochemicals and foods, which require superior chemical and oxygen barrier properties.<br>
[3]	An ethylene-vinyl alcohol (EVOH) copolymer and polyamide resins have<br>
transparency and good gas barrier properties. However, because these resins are more expensive than general-purpose resins, their contents in products are limited.<br>
[4]	Thus, to reduce costs, a blend of a resin having barrier properties, such as EVOH<br>
and polyamide resins, and inexpensive polyolefin was proposed. However, satisfactory barrier properties were not obtained.<br>
[5]	To improve barrier properties, a fully exfoliated, partially exfoliated, intercalated or<br>
partially intercalated nanocomposite formed by dispersing a nano-sized intercalated cl ay in a polymer matrix has been used. Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[6]	When a molded article is manufactured using the above-described nanocomposite,<br>
the nanocomposite should maintain its morphology having barrier property even after being molded and its moldability should be excellent to easily manufacture sheets or films as well as containers.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[7]	The present invention provides a nanocomposite composition having superior<br>
mechanical strength and superior oxygen, organic solvent, and moisture barrier properties, and superior moldability.<br>
[8]	The present invention also provides an article manufactured from the<br><br>
nanocomposite composition having barrier properties.<br>
[9]	According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a dry-blended<br>
composition including: 30 to 95 parts by weight of a polyolefin resin; 0.5 to 60 parts by weight of a melt blend including at least one resin having barrier properties, selected from the group consisting of an ethylene-vinyl alcohol (EVOH) copolymer, a polyamide, an ionomer and a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and at least one nanocomposite having barrier properties, selected from the group consisting of an EVOH copolymer/ intercalated clay nanocomposite, a polyamide/intercalated clay nanocomposite, an ionomer/intercalated clay nanocomposite and a poly vinylalcohol/intercalated clay nanocomposite; and 1 to 30 parts by weight of a compatibilizer.<br>
[10]	In an embodiment of the present invention, the resin having barrier properties and<br>
the nanocomposite having barrier properties may be molten-blended in a weight ratio from 25:75 to 75:25.<br>
[11]	In another embodiment of the present invention, the resin having barrier properties<br>
and the nanocomposite having barrier properties may be molten-blended using a co-rotation twin screw extruder or a single screw extruder at a melting point of the resin or higher.<br>
[12]	According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an article<br>
manufactured from the nanocomposite composition.<br>
[13]	In an embodiment of the present invention, the article may be manufactured through<br>
blow molding, extrusion molding, pressure molding or injection molding.<br>
[14]	In another embodiment of the present invention, the article may be a container,<br>
sheet, pipe or film having barrier properties.<br>
[15]	The present invention will now be explained in more detail.<br>
[16]	Korean Patent Application No. 2002-76575, previously filed by the applicant of the<br>
present application, discloses a nanocomposite blend composition including: 1 to 97 parts by weight of a polyolefin resin; 1 to 95 parts by weight of a nanocomposite having barrier properties, selected from the group consisting of an ethylene-vinyl alcohol (EVOH) copolymer/ intercalated clay nanocomposite, a polyamide/intercalated clay nanocomposite, an ionomer / intercalated clay nanocomposite and a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) / intercalated clay nanocomposite; and 1 to 95 parts by weight of a compatibilizer. This completes the present invention.<br>
[17]	A nanocomposite composition having barrier properties of an embodiment of the<br>
present invention is obtained by dry-blending a melt blend of a resin having barrier properties and a nanocomposite having barrier properties with a polyolefin resin and a compatibilizer.<br>
[18]	That is, the nanocomposite composition is a dry-blended composition including: 30<br>
to 95 parts by weight of a polyolefin resin; 0.5 to 60 parts by weight of a melt blend<br><br>
including at least one resin having barrier properties, selected from the group consisting of an ethylene-vinyl alcohol (EVOH) copolymer, a polyamide, an ionomer and a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and at least one nanocomposite having barrier properties selected from the group consisting of an EVOH copolymer/intercalated clay nanocomposite, a polyamide/intercalated clay nanocomposite, an ionomer/intercalated clay nanocomposite and a polyvinylalcohol/intercalated clay nanocomposite; and 1 to 30 parts by weight of a compatibilizer.<br>
[19]	The polyolefin resin may be at least one selected from the group consisting of a<br>
high density polyethylene (HOPE), a low density polyethylene (LDPE), a linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), an ethylene-propylene copolymer, metallocene and polypropylene. The polypropylene may be at least one compound selected from the group consisting of a homopolymer of polypropylene, a copolymer of polypropylene, metallocene polypropylene and a composite resin having improved physical properties by adding talc, flame retardant etc. to a homopolymer or copolymer of polypropylene.<br>
[20]	The content of the polyolefin resin is preferably 30 to 95 parts by weight, and more<br>
preferably 70 to 90 parts by weight. If the content of the polyolefin resin is less than 30 parts by weight, molding is difficult. If the content of the polyolefin resin is greater than 90 parts by weight, the barrier properties are poor.<br>
[21]	The resin/nanocomposite melt blend can be prepared by first forming an exfoliated<br>
or partially exfoliated nanocomposite having barrier properties from the resin having barrier properties and the intercalated clay and molten-blending the nanocomposite with the resin having barrier properties. Specifically, the resin/nanocomposite melt blend can be prepared by melt blending at least one resin having barrier properties, selected from the group consisting of an EVOH copolymer, a polyamide, an ionomer and a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and at least one nanocomposite having barrier properties, selected from the group consisting of an EVOH copolymer/intercalated clay nanocomposite, a polyamide/intercalated clay nanocomposite, an ionomer/intercalated clay nanocomposite and a poly inylalcohol/intercalated clay nanocomposite.<br>
[22]	The resin having barrier properties is added to the intercalated clay to form a nano-<br>
sized exfoliated or partially exfoliated nanocomposite. Due to such a nanocomposite morphology, the passage route of gas and liquid in the resin is extended, and thus moisture and liquid barrier properties of the resin itself are improved, and the melting strength of polyolefin is increased due to the intercalated clay, which prevents drop of parison in blow molding.<br>
[23]	The weight ratio of the resin having barrier properties to the intercalated clay in the<br>
nanocomposite is 58.0:42.0 to 99.9:0.1, and preferably 85.0:15.0 to 99.0:1.0. If the weight ratio of the resin having barrier properties to the intercalated clay is less than 58.0:42.0, the intercalated clay agglomerates and dispersing is difficult. If the weight<br><br>
ratio of the resin having barrier properties to the intercalated clay is greater than 99.9:0.1, the improvement in the barrier properties is negligible.<br>
[24]	Due to the use of the melt blend of the nanocomposite and the resin having barrier<br>
properties, the processing temperature range in molding can be broader. That is, components of the blend can be selected and a blending ratio can be adjusted according to the processing temperature condition required to prepare a molded article.<br>
[25]	To obtain the resin having barrier property/nanocomposite melt blend, molten-<br>
blending is preferably carried out at 175-270 °C .<br>
[26]	The intercalated clay is preferably organic intercalated clay. The content of an<br>
organic material in the intercalated clay is preferably 1 to 45 wt %. When the content of the organic material is less than 1 wt%, the compatibility of the intercalated clay and the resin having barrier properties is poor. When the content of the organic material is greater than 45 wt%, the intercalation of the resin having barrier properties is difficult.<br>
[27]	The intercalated clay includes at least one material selected from montmorillonite,<br>
bentonite, kaolinite, mica, hectorite, fluorohectorite, saponite, beidelite, nontronite, stevensite, vermiculite, hallosite, volkonskoite, suconite, magadite, and kenyalite; and the organic material preferably has a functional group selected from primary ammonium to quaternary ammonium, phosphonium, maleate, succinate, acrylate, benzylic hydrogen, oxazoline and dimethyldistearylamrnonium.<br>
[28]	The resin having barrier properties and the nanocomposite having barrier properties<br>
is preferably melt-blended in a weight ratio from 25:75 to 75:25. If the amount of the resin having barrier properties is too large, the barrier properties are not improved. If the amount of the resin having barrier properties is small, the impact strength of a final molded article is reduced.<br>
[29]	If an ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer is included in the nanocomposite, the<br>
content of ethylene in the ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer is preferably 10 to 50 mol %. If the content of ethylene is less than 10 mol %, melt molding becomes difficult due to poor processability. If the content of ethylene exceeds 50 mol %, oxygen and liquid barrier properties are insufficient.<br>
[30]	If polyamide is included in the nanocomposite, the polyamide may be nylon 4.6,<br>
nylon 6, nylon 6.6, nylon 6.10, nylon 7, nylon 8, nylon 9, nylon 11, nylon 12, nylon 46, MXD6, amorphous polyamide, a copolymerized polyamide containing at least two of these, or a mixture of at least two of these.<br>
[31 ]	The amorphous polyamide refers to a polyamide having insufficient crystallinity,<br>
that is, not having an endothermic crystalline melting peak when measured by a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (ASTM D-3417, 10 °C /min).<br>
[32]	In general, the polyamide can be prepared using diamine and dicarboxylic acid.<br>
Examples of the diamine include hexamethylenediamine,<br><br>
2-methylpentamethylenediamine, 2,2,4-trimethylhexamethylenediamine, 2,4,4-trimethylhexamethylenediamine, bis(4-aminocyclohexyl)methane, 2,2-bis(4-aminocyclohexyl)isopropylidene, 1,4-diaminocyclohexane, 1,3-diaminocyclohexane, meta-xylenediamine, 1,5-diaminopentane, 1,4-diaminobutane, 1,3-diaminopropane, 2-ethyldiaminobutane, 1,4-diaminomethylcyclohexane, methane-xylenediamine, alkyl-substituted or un-substituted m-phenylenediamine and p-phenylenediamine, etc. Examples of the di-carboxylic acid include alkyl-substituted or unsubstituted isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid, butanedicarboxylic acid, etc.<br>
[33]	Poly amide prepared using aliphatic diamine and aliphatic dicarboxylic acid is<br>
general semicrystalline polyamide (also referred to as crystalline nylon) and is not amorphous polyamide. Polyamide prepared using aromatic diamine and aromatic dicarboxylic acid is not easily treated using a general melting process.<br>
[34]	Thus, amorphous polyamide is preferably prepared, when one of diamine and di-<br>
carboxylic acid used is aromatic and the other is aliphatic. Aliphatic groups of the amorphous polyamide are preferably C -C   aliphatic or C -C alicyclic alkyls. Aromatic groups of the amorphous polyamide are preferably substituted C -C mono-<br>
1      6<br>
or bicyclic aromatic groups. However, all the above amorphous polyamide is not preferable in the present invention. For example, metaxylenediamine adipamide is easily crystallized when heated during a thermal molding process or when oriented, therefore, it is not preferable.<br>
[35]	Examples of preferable amorphous poly amides include hexamethylenediamine<br>
isophthalamide, hexamethylene diamine isophthalamide/terephthalamide terpolymer having a ratio of isophthalic acid/terephthalic acid of 99/1 to 60/40, a mixture of 2,2,4-and 2,4,4-trimethylhexamethylenediamine terephthalamide, a copolymer of hexamethylenediamine or 2-methylpentamethylenediamine and an isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid or mixtures thereof. While polyamide based on hexamethylenediamine isophthalamide/terephthalamide, which has a high terephthalic acid content, is useful, it should be mixed with another diamine such as 2-methyldiaminopentane in order to produce an amorphous polyamide that can be processed.<br>
[36]	The above amorphous polyamide comprising only the above monomers may<br>
contain a small amount of lactam, such as caprolactam or lauryl lactam, as a comonomer. It is important that the polyamide be amorphous. Therefore, any comonomer that does not crystallize polyamide can be used. About 10 wt% or less of a liquid or solid plasticizer, such as glycerole, sorbitol, or toluenesulfoneamide (Santicizer 8 monsanto) can also be included in the amorphous polyamide. For most applications, a glass transition temperature Tg (measured in a dried state, i.e., with a<br><br>
water content of about 0.12 wt% or less) of amorphous polyamide is about 70-170 °C, and preferably about 80-160 °C . The amorphous polyamide, which is not blended, has a Tg of approximately 125 °C in a dried state. The lower limit of Tg is not clear, but 70 °C is an approximate lower limit. The upper limit of Tg is not clear, too. However, when polyamide with a Tg of about 170 °C or greater is used, thermal molding is difficult. Therefore, polyamide having both an acid and an amine having aromatic groups cannot be thermally molded due to too high Tg, and thus, is not suitable for the purposes of the present invention.<br>
[37]	The polyamide may also be a semicrystalline polyamide. The semicrystalline<br>
polyamide is generally prepared using lactam, such as nylon 6 or nylon 11, or an amino acid, or is prepared by condensing diamine, such as hexamethylenediamine, with dibasic acid, such as succinic acid, adipic acid, or sebacic acid. The polyamide may be a copolymer or a terpolymer such as a copolymer of hexamethylenediamine/ adipic acid and caprolactam (nylon 6,66). A mixture of two or more crystalline polyamides can also be used. The semicrystalline and amorphous polyamides are prepared by condensation polymerization well-known in the art.<br>
[38]	If an ionomer is included in the nanocomposite, the ionomer is preferably a<br>
copolymer of acrylic acid and ethylene, with a melt index of 0.1 to 10 g/10 min (190 °C,2,160g).<br>
[39]	The content of the melt blend is preferably 0.5 to 60 parts by weight, and more<br>
preferably 8 to 30 parts by weight. If the content of the melt blend is less than 0.5 part by weight, an improvement of barrier properties is negligible. If the content of the melt blend is greater than 60 parts by weight, processing is difficult.<br>
[40]	The compatibilizer improves the compatibility of the polyolefm resin with the resin<br>
having barrier properties/the nanocomposite to form a stable composition.<br>
[41]	The compatibilizer may be a hydrocarbon polymer having polar groups. When a hy-<br>
drocarbon polymer having polar groups is used, the hydrocarbon polymer portion increases the affinity of the compatibilizer to the polyolefm resin and to the resin having barrier properties/the nanocomposite, thereby obtaining a stable composition.<br>
[42]	The compatibilizer can include an compound selected from an epoxy-modified<br>
polystyrene copolymer, an ethylene-ethylene anhydride-acrylic acid copolymer, an ethylene-ethyl acrylate copolymer, an ethylene-alky 1 aery late-aery lie acid copolymer, a maleic anhydride modified (graft) high-density polyethylene, a maleic anhydride modified (graft) linear low-density polyethylene, an ethylene-alkyl methacrylate-methacrylic acid copolymer, an ethylene-butyl acrylate copolymer, an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, a maleic anhydride modified (graft) ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, and a modification thereof.<br>
[43]	The content of the compatibilizer is preferably 1 to 30 parts by weight, and more<br><br>
preferably 2 to 20 parts by weight. If the content of the compatibilizer is less than 1 part by weight, the mechanical properties of a molded article from the composition are poor. If the content of the compatibilizer is greater than 30 parts by weight, the molding of the composition is difficult.<br>
[44]	When an epoxy-modified polystyrene copolymer is used as the compatibilizer, a<br>
copolymer comprising a main chain which comprises 70 to 99 parts by weight of styrene and 1 to 30 part by weight of an epoxy compound represented by Formula 1, and branches which comprise 1 to 80 parts by weight of acrylic monomers represented by Formula 2, is preferable. H      H<br>

[45]	where each of R and R' is independently a C -C   aliphatic residue or a C -C<br>

[46]	Each of the maleic anhydride modified (graft) high-density polyethylene, maleic<br>

When the content of the maleic anhydride is less than 0.1 part by weight, it does not function as the compatibilizer. When the content of the maleic anhydride is greater than 10 parts by weight, it is not preferable due to an unpleasant odor.<br>
[47]	A container having barrier properties can be manufactured by molding the<br>
nanocomposite composition having barrier properties according to the present invention. Due to the dry-blended nanocomposite composition, the nanocomposite morphology having barrier properties can be maintained to obtain a molded article having good barrier properties.<br>
[48]	The molded article may be obtained by a general molding method including<br>
blowing molding, extrusion molding, pressure molding and injection molding.<br>
[49]	In addition to the container having barrier properties, a sheet or film having barrier<br>
properties can be manufactured.<br>
[50]	The container or sheet having barrier properties can be a multi-layered container or<br>
film further including an adhesive layer and a polyolefm layer.<br>
[51 ]	For example, the sheet or container having barrier properties can be manufacture<br>
from a 5-layered film of HDPE/adhesive/ nanocomposite composition of the present<br>
invention/adhesive/HDPE.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
[52]	The nanocomposite composition according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention has superior barrier properties and moldability, and thus the article manufactured therefrom has an excellent performance as a container, sheet or film having<br>
barrier properties.<br>

reference to exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein<br>
without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the<br>
