				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Expanded  Polypropylene  Resin  Beads  and  Foamed  Molded<br>
Article Thereof<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Technical Field:<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to expanded<br>
polypropylene resin beads and to a foamed molded article<br>
obtained by molding the beads in a mold cavity.<br>
Description of Prior Art<br>
[0002]<br>
A polypropylene resin is now utilized in various<br>
fields because of its excellent balance between the<br>
mechanical strength, heat resistance, processability and<br>
cost and excellent performance of incineration and<br>
recyclability. Because a foamed molded article obtained<br>
by molding expanded polypropylene resin beads in a mold<br>
cavity (such a foamed molded article will be hereinafter<br>
occasionally referred to as "PP bead molding" for the sake<br>
of brevity, and expanded polypropylene resin beads will be<br>
hereinafter occasionally referred to as "PP beads" for the<br>
sake of brevity) can retain the above excellent properties<br>
and have additional characteristics such as cushioning<br>
property, heat resistance and lightness in weight, they<br>
are utilized for various applications such as packaging<br>
materials, construction materials and impact absorbing<br>
materials for vehicles.<br>
[0003]<br>
The PP bead moldings have generally superior heat<br>
resistance, chemical resistance, toughness and compressive<br>
strain recovery as compared with foamed molded articles of<br>
expanded polystyrene beads which are also utilized for the<br>
same applications as those of the PP bead moldings.<br>
 <br>
However, in order to secondarily expand and fusion-bond PP<br>
beads in a mold cavity for producing a PP bead molding, it<br>
is necessary to use a higher temperature, namely steam<br>
with a higher saturation vapor pressure, than that for use<br>
in the production of foamed molded articles of expanded<br>
polystyrene beads.  Thus, the production of PP bead<br>
moldings needs a mold having a highly pressure resistant<br>
structure and a specific molding apparatus of a high<br>
pressure pressing type and requires a high energy cost.<br>
[0004]<br>
To cope with the above problem, Japanese Laid-Open<br>
Patent Publication No. JP-2000-894-A proposes coating PP<br>
beads with a resin having a low melting point.  In order<br>
to prepare such coated PP beads, however, complicated<br>
apparatus and process are required.  Further, although<br>
fusion-bonding efficiency of the PP beads is improved, the<br>
produced PP bead molding is not fully satisfactory with<br>
respect to the appearance because the secondary expansion<br>
of the PP beads is insufficient.  In order to improve the<br>
secondary expansion, it is necessary to increase an inside<br>
pressure of the PP beads with a pressurized gas, to press-<br>
fill the PP beads in a mold cavity with a high ratio or to<br>
use high temperature steam which is contrary to the<br>
initial objective of JP-2000-894-A.<br>
[0005]<br>
As an alternate solution to the above problem, Japanese<br>
Laid-Open Patent Publication No. JP-H06-240041-A proposes<br>
the use of, as a base resin for PP beads, a polypropylene<br>
resin having a relatively low melting point such as a<br>
polypropylene resin obtained using a metallocene<br>
polymerization catalyst.  In general, a polypropylene<br>
resin produced using a metallocene polymerization catalyst<br>
is able to have a lower melting point than that produced<br>
using a Ziegler Natta catalyst.  In the technique as<br>
taught by JP-H06-240041-A in which PP beads produced using<br>
 <br>
a metallocene polymerization catalyst are used, however,<br>
there is plenty of room left for improvement with respect<br>
to reduction of the saturation vapor pressure of steam<br>
used as a heating medium in the in-mold molding,<br>
appearance of the obtained PP bead molding and moldability<br>
such as fusion bonding efficiency of the PP beads.<br>
[0006]<br>
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. JP-H10-<br>
292064-A discloses non-cross-linked PP beads of a modified<br>
polypropylene resin obtained by graft-polymerizing a vinyl<br>
monomer to a polypropylene resin.  The modified resin has<br>
a polypropylene resin content of 97 to 65% by weight and a<br>
vinyl polymer content of 3 to 35% by weight. Whilst the<br>
proposed PP beads may permit the use of steam with a<br>
reduced saturation vapor pressure by using a polypropylene<br>
resin having a low melting point.  The obtained PP bead<br>
molding causes a problem with respect to the heat<br>
resistance which generally depends upon the melting point<br>
or glass transition point of the PP beads.<br>
[0007]<br>
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. JP-2006-<br>
96805-A discloses PP beads made of two polypropylene<br>
resins having a difference in melting point therebetween<br>
of 15 to 30°C, a melt index (JIS K7210-1999, Test<br>
Condition M (at a temperature of 230°C and a load of 2.16<br>
kg)) of 3 to 20 g/10 min and an expansion ratio of 10 to<br>
50.  The proposed PP beads, however, require a molding<br>
temperature of more than 140°C, i.e. steam with a high<br>
saturation vapor pressure must be used as a heating medium<br>
for molding the PP beads.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0008]<br>
The present invention has been made in view of the<br>
above circumstance and has as its object the provision of<br>
 <br>
expanded polypropylene resin beads which can be molded in<br>
a mold cavity at a low molding temperature in a stable<br>
manner to give a foamed molded article having excellent<br>
properties inherent to polypropylene resin foamed moldings<br>
such as toughness, heat resistance, performance of<br>
incineration and recyclability.  It is also an object of<br>
the present invention to provide a foamed molded article<br>
obtained by molding the expanded polypropylene resin beads<br>
in a mold cavity.<br>
[0009]<br>
With a view toward solving the above problems, the<br>
present inventors have made an extensive study on<br>
relationship between (i) DSC characteristics of expanded<br>
beads as measured by differential scanning calorimetry,<br>
(ii) changes in apparent density of expanded beads before<br>
and after in-mold molding, (iii) behaviors of expanded<br>
beads in a mold cavity and (iv) mechanical properties of<br>
foamed molded articles obtained by molding expanded beads<br>
in a mold cavity. As a result, it has been found that, by<br>
controlling a peak temperature of an endothermic fusion<br>
peak observed in a DSC curve obtained by differential<br>
scanning calorimetric analysis of expanded polypropylene<br>
resin beads as well as a change in apparent density before<br>
and after the secondary expansion of the expanded beads in<br>
a mold cavity, a foamed molded article having excellent<br>
physical properties can be obtained in a stable manner<br>
using a reduced molding temperature without adversely<br>
affecting the excellent properties inherent to the<br>
expanded polypropylene resin beads. The present invention<br>
has been completed based on the above finding.  It has<br>
been also found that expanded beads and a foamed molded<br>
article thereof having the above characteristics may be<br>
easily obtained when a mixture of two polypropylene resins,<br>
which have specific melting point ranges and which differ<br>
in melting point by a specific temperature range, is used<br>
 <br>
as a base resin of the expanded beads.<br>
[0010]<br>
That is, the present invention provides expanded<br>
polypropylene resin beads as set forth in below (1) to (5)<br>
(hereinafter occasionally referred to as Embodiment-I) and<br>
a foamed molded article as set forth in below (6) obtained<br>
by molding the expanded polypropylene resin beads in a<br>
mold cavity (hereinafter occasionally referred to as<br>
Embodiment-II).<br>
(1)	Expanded polypropylene resin beads (b) having a<br>
resin melting point of not less than 120°C but less than<br>
140°C, said resin melting point being determined from a<br>
DSC curve obtained by heat flux differential scanning<br>
calorimetry in accordance with JIS K7121-1987 in which a<br>
sample of 1 to 3 mg of the expanded polypropylene resin<br>
beads (b) is heated to 200°C at a heating rate of<br>
10°C/minute, then cooled to 30°C at a rate of 10°C/minute,<br>
and again heated from 30°C to 200°C at a heating rate of<br>
10°C/minute to obtain the DSC curve, said expanded<br>
polypropylene resin beads (b) having an apparent density<br>
P1 before heating and an apparent density p2 after being<br>
heated for 10 seconds in a closed vessel with saturated<br>
steam at a temperature lower by 5°C than the resin melting<br>
point, wherein a ratio pR (=p1/ P2) of the apparent<br>
density p1 before heating to the apparent density p2 after<br>
heating is not greater than 1.5.<br>
(2)	The expanded polypropylene resin beads (b) as recited<br>
in above (1), wherein the expanded polypropylene resin<br>
beads (b) comprise a polypropylene resin (a) as a base<br>
resin, said polypropylene resin (a) being a mixed resin<br>
containing 50 to 80% by weight of a polypropylene resin<br>
(al) having a melting point higher than 110°C but not<br>
higher than 135°C and 50 to 20% by weight of a<br>
polypropylene resin (a2) having a melting point not lower<br>
than 125°C but not higher than 140°C with the total amount<br>
 <br>
of the polypropylene resins (al) and (a2) being 100% by<br>
weight, and wherein a difference in melting point between<br>
the polypropylene resins (al) and (a2) [(melting point of<br>
(a2)) - (melting point of (al))] is not less than 5°C but<br>
less than 15°C.<br>
(3)	The expanded polypropylene resin beads (b) as recited<br>
in above (2), wherein at least one of the polypropylene<br>
resins (al) and (a2) is a polypropylene resin obtained<br>
using a metallocene polymerization catalyst.<br>
(4)	The expanded polypropylene resin beads (b) as recited<br>
in above (2), wherein at least one of the polypropylene<br>
resins (al) and (a2) has a melt flow rate, as measured in<br>
accordance with JIS K7210-1999, Test Condition M (at a<br>
temperature of 230°C and a load of 2.16 kg) of 20 g/10 min<br>
or more.<br>
(5)	The expanded polypropylene resin beads (b) as recited<br>
in above (1), wherein the expanded polypropylene resin<br>
beads (b) show a plurality of endothermic peaks in a DSC<br>
curve obtained by heat flux differential scanning<br>
calorimetry in accordance with JIS K7122-1987 in which a<br>
sample of 1 to 3 mg of the expanded polypropylene resin<br>
beads (b) is heated from ambient temperature to 200°C at a<br>
heating rate of 10°C/minute, and wherein the sum of the<br>
calorific values of peaks having a peak temperature in the<br>
range of from 120°C to 135°C is 50 to 90% of a total<br>
calorific value of said plurality of endothermic peaks.<br>
(6)	A molded foamed article ' obtained by molding the<br>
expanded polypropylene resin beads (b) according to any<br>
one of above (1) to (5) in a mold cavity.<br>
[0011]<br>
The expanded polypropylene resin beads (b) of the<br>
Embodiment-I have excellent fusion bonding efficiency and<br>
secondary expandability and, therefore, the suitable<br>
temperature range for molding the expanded polypropylene<br>
resin beads (b) in a mold cavity is broadened toward a low<br>
 <br>
temperature side as compared with the conventional<br>
expanded polypropylene resin beads.<br>
Accordingly, the expanded polypropylene resin beads<br>
(b) can be molded in a mold cavity at a lower molding<br>
temperature (namely using steam having a lower saturation<br>
vapor pressure).  Therefore, the pressure at which the<br>
mold is kept closed may be reduced and the mold can be<br>
constructed using a thinner wall.  It follows that the<br>
molding machine and the mold may be designed to operate<br>
under a low pressure environment.  Thus, the molding<br>
apparatus as a whole can be constructed into a low cost-<br>
type. Moreover, a significant reduction of energy costs<br>
for the molding operation may be achieved.<br>
Additionally, the expanded polypropylene resin beads<br>
(b) of the Embodiment-I may be constituted such that the<br>
temperature at which the expanded beads are fusion-bonded<br>
together may be made lower than the temperature at which<br>
the expanded beads are secondarily expanded. With such<br>
expanded beads, fusion bonding of the expanded beads to<br>
each other can be followed by the secondary expansion<br>
thereof. When the molding of the expanded beads can be<br>
carried out in this manner, it is possible to uniformly<br>
heat, with steam, the entire expanded beads located not<br>
only in a surface region but also in an inside region of a<br>
foamed molded article to be produced. Therefore, it is<br>
possible to produce a foamed molded article having such a<br>
large thickness that could not be easily produced using<br>
the conventional expanded polypropylene resin beads.  In<br>
particular, the present invention makes it possible to<br>
produce a thick foamed molded article with a thickness of<br>
100 mm or more which can give, by cutting, sheets or<br>
boards free of insufficient fusion bonding between the<br>
expanded beads.<br>
[0012]<br>
The foamed molded article of Embodiment-II obtained<br>
 <br>
by molding the expanded polypropylene resin beads (b) of<br>
the Embodiment-I in a mold cavity not only excels in<br>
appearance and mechanical properties but also has good<br>
dimensional stability because shrinkage and deformation<br>
during molding can be suppressed. Therefore, the foamed<br>
molded article may be suitably used as a variety of<br>
applications. Further, the foamed molded article of<br>
Embodiment-II may be imparted with better flexibility as<br>
compared with an article prepared from the conventional<br>
polypropylene resin expanded beads and, therefore, may be<br>
processed into a complicated die-cut product or a bent<br>
product.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED<br>
EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
 <br>
[0014]<br>
In the following description, the expanded<br>
polypropylene resin beads of Embodiment-I according to the<br>
present invention will be occasionally referred to as "PP<br>
beads (b)" for the sake of brevity. The base resin used<br>
for producing PP beads (b) will be occasionally referred<br>
to as "PP resin (a)". When PP resin (a) is a mixture of<br>
two polypropylene resins, one of them having a melting<br>
point higher than 110°C but not higher than 135°C will be<br>
occasionally referred to as "PP resin (al), while the<br>
other polypropylene resin having a melting point not lower<br>
than 125°C but not higher than 140°C will be occasionally<br>
referred to as "PP resin (a2)". The foamed molded article<br>
obtained by molding PP beads (b) in a mold cavity will be<br>
occasionally referred to as "PP bead molding (c)".<br>
[0015]<br>
[1] Embodiment-I (PP beads (b))<br>
It is important that PP beads (b) according to<br>
Embodiment-I have a resin melting point of not less than<br>
120°C but less than 140°C.  The resin melting point is<br>
determined from a DSC curve obtained by heat flux<br>
differential scanning calorimetry in accordance with JIS<br>
K7121-1987 in which 1 to 3 mg of a sample of PP beads (b)<br>
is heated to 200°C at a heating rate of 10°C/minute, then<br>
cooled to 30°C at a rate of 10°C/minute, and again heated<br>
from 30°C to 200°C at a heating rate of 10°C/minute to<br>
obtain the DSC curve.  It is also important that PP beads<br>
(b) have a ratio pR (=p1/ p2) (where p1 represents an<br>
apparent density thereof before heating and p2 represents<br>
an apparent density thereof after being heated for 10<br>
seconds in a closed vessel with saturated steam at a<br>
temperature lower by 5°C than the resin melting point) of<br>
not greater than 1.5.<br>
[0016]<br>
PP resin (a) used as a base resin of PP beads (b) is<br>
 <br>
not specifically limited with respect to the composition<br>
thereof and process for the production thereof as long as<br>
it contains propylene as  its main monomer component.<br>
Examples of PP resin (a) include propylene homopolymers,<br>
propylene random copolymers, propylene block copolymers,<br>
propylene graft copolymers and mixtures thereof.  Details<br>
of PP resin (a) will be described hereinafter.<br>
[0017]<br>
(1) PP beads (b)<br>
(1-1) Resin melting point of PP beads (b) determined from<br>
DSC curve<br>
PP beads (b) have a resin melting point of not less<br>
than 120°C but less than 140°C. The resin melting point<br>
is determined from a DSC curve obtained by heat flux<br>
differential scanning calorimetry in accordance with JIS<br>
K7121-1987 in which a sample of 1 to 3 mg of PP beads (b)<br>
is heated to 200°C at a heating rate of 10°C/minute (first<br>
heating), then cooled to 30°C at a rate of 10°C/minute,<br>
and again heated from 30°C to 200°C at a heating rate of<br>
10°C/minute (second heating) to obtain the DSC curve<br>
(hereinafter occasionally referred to as "second time DSC<br>
curve").<br>
The resin melting point of PP beads (b) governs<br>
major physical properties which have an influence upon in-<br>
mold moldability thereof. When PP beads (b) are made of<br>
two kinds of polypropylene resins with different melting<br>
points, a plurality of endothermic peaks attributed to<br>
fusion thereof may be observed in the second time DSC<br>
curve.  In such a case, the peak temperature of the fusion<br>
peak located on the highest temperature side in the DSC<br>
curve may govern major physical properties which have an<br>
influence upon in-mold moldability of the PP beads (b).<br>
Further, the term "a peak temperature of a fusion<br>
peak" in the present specification is intended to refer to<br>
a peak top temperature of the fusion peak.<br>
 <br>
[0018]<br>
A DSC curve (hereinafter occasionally referred to as<br>
"first time DSC curve") may be obtained when a sample of<br>
PP beads (b) is first heated from ambient temperature to<br>
200°C at a heating rate of 10°C/minute in the above-<br>
mentioned heat flux differential scanning calorimetry.<br>
There is a case where the first time DSC curve shows not<br>
only a main, intrinsic endothermic peak attributed to the<br>
fusion of the resin but also a high temperature<br>
endothermic peak located at a higher temperature side of<br>
the main endothermic peak and attributed to the fusion of<br>
secondary crystals.  It is preferred that such an<br>
endothermic peak attributed to the secondary crystals has<br>
a specific range of calorific value as described<br>
hereinafter for reasons of desired mechanical properties<br>
of a foamed molded article obtained from the PP beads (b).<br>
Incidentally, in Embodiment-I of the present invention,<br>
the resin melting point of PP beads (b) which governs the<br>
main physical properties required in in-mold molding step<br>
is determined from the second time DSC curve in order to<br>
obtain the precise melting point by eliminating an<br>
influence of the secondary crystals.  In the present<br>
specification, the ambient temperature is intended to<br>
refer to about 25°C.<br>
[0019]<br>
The resin melting point of PP beads (b) is determined<br>
by the method specified in JIS K7121-1987 in which a<br>
sample of 1 to 3 mg of PP beads (b) (which may be made of<br>
only one PP resin (a) or a mixture of two or more PP<br>
resins) is subjected to heat flux differential scanning<br>
calorimetry.  Thus, the sample is first heated from<br>
ambient temperature to 200°C at a heating rate of<br>
10°C/minute. The melted sample is then cooled to 30°C at<br>
a rate of 10°C/minute so that secondary crystallization is<br>
prevented from proceeding.  The obtained solid having no<br>
 <br>
or an extremely small degree of secondary crystallization<br>
is then heated again from 30°C to 200°C (above melt<br>
completion temperature) at a heating rate of 10°C/minute<br>
to obtain the second time DSC curve from which the melting<br>
point is determined.<br>
In the second time DSC curve, one or a plurality of<br>
endothermic peaks attributed to fusion of polymer crystals<br>
are present. When only one endothermic peak is present,<br>
the peak temperature of the endothermic peak is the resin<br>
melting point (TmA) of PP beads (b). When two or more<br>
endothermic peaks are present, the calorific value of each<br>
of the endothermic peaks is determined by the partial area<br>
analyzing method described below.  From the obtained<br>
results, the resin melting point is determined. Namely,<br>
the resin melting point (TmA) of PP beads (b) is the peak<br>
temperature of the endothermic peak having the highest<br>
peak temperature among those endothermic peaks which have<br>
a calorific value of 4 J/g or more (see FIG. 2). The<br>
resin melting point of PP beads (b) may be determined by<br>
the DSC analysis using, in lieu of a sample of PP beads<br>
(b), a sample obtained from a foamed molded article<br>
produced from PP beads (b) or a sample of the<br>
polypropylene resin (base resin) from which PP beads are<br>
made.<br>
[0020]<br>
The partial area analyzing method will be explained<br>
below with reference to a DSC curve of FIG. 1.  In the<br>
illustrated case, the DSC curve has three endothermic<br>
peaks. At the outset, a straight line (a-(3) extending<br>
between the point a on the curve at 80°C and the point (3<br>
on the curve at a melt completion temperature Te of the<br>
resin is drawn. Next, a line which is parallel with the<br>
ordinate and which passes through a point y1 in the curve<br>
at the bottom of the valley between the lowermost<br>
temperature endothermic peak X1 and the neighboring<br>
 <br>
endothermic peak x2 is drawn. This line crosses the line<br>
(α-β) at a point 1 .  Similarly, a line which is parallel<br>
with the ordinate and which passes a point Y2 in the curve<br>
at the bottom of the valley between the endothermic peak<br>
x2 and the neighboring endothermic peak x3 is drawn. This<br>
line crosses the line (α-β) at a point 52 .<br>
If additional endothermic peaks x4, x5, x6••• are<br>
present, similar procedures are carried out.  The thus<br>
obtained line segments (5n-Yn) where n is an integer of 1<br>
or more, define boundaries between two neighboring<br>
endothermic peaks xn-1 and xn (n is as defined above) .  Thus,<br>
the area of the endothermic peak x1 is an area defined by<br>
the DSC curve of the endothermic peak x1 , the line segment<br>
(-Y1) and the line segment (α-) and corresponds to the<br>
calorific value (amount of endotherm AH1) of the<br>
endothermic peak Xi . The area of the endothermic peak X2<br>
is an area defined by the DSC curve of the endothermic<br>
peak X2, the line segment (-Y1), the line segment (-<br>
Y2 ) and the line segment (-2) and corresponds to the<br>
calorific value (amount of endotherm AH2) of the<br>
endothermic peak X2 . The area of the endothermic peak X3<br>
is an area defined by the DSC curve of the endothermic<br>
peak X3, the line segment (62-Y2) and the line segment<br>
(-β) and corresponds to the calorific value (amount of<br>
endotherm AH3) of the endothermic peak X3.  If there are<br>
additional endothermic peaks X4 , X5, X6•••, the calorific<br>
values thereof may be determined in the same manner as<br>
above. Thus, from the given DSC curve, the calorific<br>
values (AH1, AH2, AH3 • • • ) of respective endothermic peaks<br>
may be determined.<br>
The calorific values (AH1, AH2, AH3 •••) may be<br>
automatically computed by the differential scanning<br>
calorimeter on the basis of the peak areas.<br>
The total calorific value AH of the resin is the sum of<br>
the calorific values of the endothermic peaks (AH = AH1 +<br>
 <br>
H2 + AH3 • • •) •  In the above partial area analyzing<br>
method, the position on the DSC curve at 80°C is used as<br>
the point a, because the base line extending between such<br>
a point a and the point (5 at the melt completion<br>
temperature Te has been found to be best suited to<br>
determine the calorific value of each of the endothermic<br>
peaks with high reliance and reproducibility in a stable<br>
manner. The above-described partial area analyzing method<br>
may be also adopted for the determination of calorific<br>
values of peaks in the first time DSC curve as described<br>
hereinafter.<br>
[0021]<br>
When the resin melting point of PP beads (b), as<br>
determined from the second time DSC curve, is not less<br>
than 120°C but less than 140°C, the suitable temperature<br>
range for molding PP beads (b) in a mold cavity can be<br>
broadened toward a low temperature side without adversely<br>
affecting the excellent physical properties of PP beads.<br>
That is, PP beads (b) having the above specific<br>
resin melting point (TmA) permit the use of a low heating<br>
temperature (use of steam with a low saturation vapor<br>
pressure).  Therefore, the pressure at which the mold is<br>
kept closed may be reduced and the molding machine and the<br>
mold may be designed to operate under a low pressure<br>
environment.  Further, a significant reduction of energy<br>
costs for the molding operation may be achieved as<br>
compared with the conventional expanded polypropylene<br>
resin beads.<br>
[0022]<br>
(1-2)  Ratio pR of apparent densities before and after<br>
heating of PP beads (b)<br>
It is important that PP beads (b) of Embodiment-I<br>
have an apparent density ratio pR of not greater than 1.5.<br>
The apparent density ratio pR (= p1 /p2) herein is a ratio<br>
of the apparent density px of PP beads (b) before heating<br>
 <br>
to the apparent density p2 thereof after being heated for<br>
10 seconds in a closed vessel with saturated steam at a<br>
temperature lower by 5°C than the resin melting point.<br>
The lower limit of the apparent density ratio (pR) is<br>
preferably 1.3 for reasons of excellent appearance and<br>
excellent fusion bonding between expanded beads of PP bead<br>
molding (c) obtained from PP beads (b).<br>
[0023]<br>
The apparent density ratio pR is determined by<br>
measuring the densities of PP beads (b) before and after<br>
the heating as follows.<br>
(i) Measurement of apparent density pi of PP beads  (b)<br>
before heating<br>
In a measuring cylinder containing water at 23°C,<br>
about 500 mL (weight Wl) of PP beads (b) which have been<br>
allowed to stand at 23°C and 1 atm under 50 % relative<br>
humidity for 48 hours are immersed using a wire net.  From<br>
a rise of the water level, the apparent volume VI (L) is<br>
determined.  The apparent density is obtained by dividing<br>
the weight Wl (g) of PP beads (b) by the apparent volume<br>
VI (L) (px = Wl/Vl).<br>
(ii) Measurement of apparent density p2 of PP beads (b)<br>
after heating<br>
PP beads (b) are charged in a closed pressure<br>
resisting vessel and heated for 10 seconds with saturated<br>
steam at a temperature lower by 5°C than the resin melting<br>
point (TmA) . The vessel is then opened to atmospheric<br>
pressure and is cooled with water.  Then heat-treated PP<br>
beads (b) are taken out of the vessel, dried in an oven at<br>
60°C for 12 hours and pressurized with air at 0.2 MPa(G)<br>
for 12 hours. In a measuring cylinder containing water at<br>
23°C, about 500 mL (weight W2) of heat treated PP beads<br>
(b) are immersed using a wire net.  From a rise of the<br>
water level, the apparent volume V2 (L) is determined.<br>
The apparent density after heating is obtained by dividing<br>
 <br>
the weight W2 (g) of PP beads (b) by the apparent volume<br>
V2 (L) (p2 = W2/V2) .<br>
(iii) Apparent density ratio pR<br>
The apparent density ratio pR is obtained from the<br>
following equation:<br>
PR = P1 / P2<br>
[0024]<br>
The expanded beads may be classified into two types;<br>
first, those which start fusion bonding before secondary<br>
expansion when heated in a mold cavity and, second, those<br>
which start secondary expansion before fusion bonding.  In<br>
the case of the second type expanded beads, in which<br>
fusion bonding is preceded by the secondary expansion, the<br>
spaces between expanded beads placed in the mold cavity<br>
tend to narrow and decrease by the expansion thereof<br>
before fusion bonding proceeds sufficiently. As a result,<br>
a heating medium (steam) is prevented from uniformly<br>
flowing and passing through the spaces between expanded<br>
beads. Thus, the expanded beads are not uniformly heated<br>
and fusion-bonded together.  On the other hand, in the<br>
first type expanded beads, in which secondary expansion is<br>
preceded by the fusion bonding, no such narrowing and<br>
decreasing of the spaces between the expanded beads occur<br>
before fusion bonding proceeds sufficiently, so that the<br>
entire expanded beads can be uniformly heated with steam.<br>
The conventional expanded polypropylene resin beads are of<br>
the second type.<br>
[0025]<br>
In the measurement of the apparent density P2 of PP<br>
beads (b) after heating, PP beads (b) are heated at a<br>
temperature lower by 5°C than the resin melting point<br>
(TmA) thereof.  The reason for using this temperature is<br>
that in-mold molding of expanded beads is generally<br>
carried out at a temperature lower by 5°C than the resin<br>
melting point thereof.<br>
 <br>
Conventional expanded polypropylene resin beads have<br>
an apparent density ratio pR of above 1.5 and relatively<br>
high expansion power. Thus, the conventional expanded<br>
beads are of the second type in which the secondary<br>
expansion occurs first. PP beads (b) of the present<br>
invention having an apparent density ratio pR of not<br>
greater than 1.5 are of the first type in which the fusion<br>
bonding starts occurring first when molded in a mold<br>
cavity. Therefore, the suitable temperature range for<br>
molding PP beads (b) in a mold cavity can be broadened<br>
toward a low temperature side. Additionally, the<br>
conditions under which the in-mold molding is carried out<br>
may be improved and foamed molded articles having<br>
excellent appearance and mechanical properties may be<br>
obtained. A preferred method for producing PP beads (b)<br>
of the first type in which the fusion bonding occurs first<br>
will be described hereinafter.<br>
In in-mold molding of expanded beads, various<br>
treatments such as press filling of the expanded beads in<br>
a mold cavity and increase of inside pressure of the<br>
expanded beads may be adopted to improve the secondary<br>
expandability of the expanded beads. However when such a<br>
treatment is carried out for expanded beads having an<br>
apparent density ratio pR of greater than 1.5, the<br>
resulting expanded beads more easily undergo secondary<br>
expansion before fusion bonding.<br>
[0026]<br>
PP beads (b) generally have an apparent density of<br>
10 to 500 g/L. From the viewpoint of basic properties of<br>
foamed molded articles such as lightness in weight and<br>
cushioning property, the apparent density of PP beads (b)<br>
is preferably 300 g/L or less, more preferably 180 g/L or<br>
less.  For reasons of freedom or absence of cell breakage,<br>
the apparent density of PP beads (b) is preferably 12 g/L<br>
or more, more preferably 15 g/L or more.<br>
 <br>
[0027]<br>
(2) PP resin (a)<br>
PP resin (a) used as a base resin of PP beads (b) is<br>
not specifically limited with respect to the composition<br>
thereof and process for the production thereof.  Specific<br>
examples of PP resin (a) include propylene homopolymers,<br>
ethylene-propylene block copolymers, ethylene-propylene<br>
random copolymers, propylene-butene random copolymers,<br>
propylene-butene block copolymers and ethylene-propylene-<br>
butene terpolymers. A mixture of two or more different<br>
resins mentioned above may be used as PP resin (a).<br>
Details of PP resin (a) are as follows.<br>
(2-1) Monomer component<br>
PP resin (a) constituting PP beads (b) may be a<br>
propylene-based resin obtained by polymerizing a propylene<br>
monomer as a main raw material.  Any propylene-based resin,<br>
such as propylene homopolymers, propylene random<br>
copolymers, propylene block copolymers and propylene graft<br>
copolymers and mixtures thereof, may be used as PP resin<br>
(a), as long as PP beads (b) obtained therefrom have a<br>
resin melting point, as determined from its second time<br>
DSC curve, of not less than 120°C but less than 140°C.<br>
The above-mentioned propylene-based copolymer is a<br>
copolymer of propylene with one or more copolymerizable<br>
comonomers such as ethylene and a-olefins having 4   to 20<br>
carbon atoms such as 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-<br>
octene and 4-methyl-l-butene.<br>
[0028]<br>
The propylene-based copolymer may be a two-component<br>
copolymer such as a propylene-ethylene random copolymer<br>
and a propylene-butene random terpolymer or a three-<br>
component copolymer such as a propylene-ethylene-butene<br>
random copolymer. Two or more mixed resins may be used as<br>
PP resin (a), as long as PP beads (b) obtained therefrom<br>
have a resin melting point, as determined from its second<br>
 <br>
time DSC curve, of not less than 120°C but less than 140°C.<br>
The proportion of the comonomer in the propylene-<br>
based copolymer is not specifically limited. Generally,<br>
however, the propylene-based copolymer has a content of<br>
structural units derived from propylene of 70% by weight<br>
or more, preferably 80 to 99.5% by weight and a content of<br>
structural units derived from ethylene and/or a-olefins<br>
having 4 to 20 carbon atoms of less than 30% by weight,<br>
preferably 0.5 to 20% by weight.<br>
[0029]<br>
(2-2) Polymerization catalyst<br>
A polymerization catalyst used for producing PP resin<br>
(a) is not specifically limited. An organometallic<br>
complex having polymerization catalytic activity may be<br>
suitably used.  For example, there may be mentioned (i) an<br>
organometallic complex, called Ziegler Natta catalyst,<br>
containing titanium, aluminum and magnesium as active<br>
metals modified in at least partially with an alkyl group,<br>
(ii) an organometallic complex, called a metallocene<br>
polymerization catalyst or homogeneous catalyst containing<br>
a transition metal, such as zirconium, titanium, thorium,<br>
lutetium, lanthanum and iron, or boron as a metal center<br>
and a ligand such as a cyclopentane ring, or (iii) a<br>
combination of the organometallic complex and methyl<br>
alumoxan.<br>
[0030]<br>
A metallocene polymerization catalyst can<br>
copolymerize propylene with a comonomer which is difficult<br>
to be copolymerized using a conventional Ziegler-Natta<br>
catalyst to give a propylene-based copolymer which can be<br>
used as PP resin (a).  Examples of such a comonomer<br>
include cyclic olefins, such as cyclopentene, norbornene<br>
and 1,4,5,8-dimethano-l,2,3,4,4a,8,8a,6-<br>
octahydronaphthalene, non-conjugated dienes, such as 5-<br>
methyl-1,4-hexadiene and 7-methyl-6-octadiene, and<br>
 <br>
aromatic unsaturated compounds such as styrene and divinyl<br>
benzene.  These comonomers may be used singly or in<br>
combination of two or more thereof.<br>
A polypropylene resin produced using a metallocene<br>
polymerization catalyst, in particular azulenyl-type<br>
catalyst, generally has a lower melting point than that<br>
produced using a conventional Ziegler Natta polymerization<br>
catalyst, because of the presence of position irregular<br>
units attributed to 2,1-insertion and 1,3-insertion of<br>
propylene monomer in the total propylene insertion as<br>
determined from 13NMR spectrum (see, for example, Japanese<br>
Laid-Open Patent Publication No. JP-2003-327740-A) and may<br>
be used for the purpose of the present invention.<br>
[0031]<br>
(2-3) PP resin (a) of mixed resin<br>
(i) PP resin (a) including two or more kinds of resins<br>
PP resin (a) as a base resin of PP beads (b) may be a<br>
mixed resin containing two or more polypropylene resins.<br>
From the standpoint of practical use, the use of two or<br>
more polypropylene resins as a mixture is preferable.  In<br>
this case, it is preferred that PP resin (a) be comprised<br>
of 50 to 80% by weight of PP resin (al) having a melting<br>
point higher than 110°C but not higher than 135°C and 50<br>
to 20% by weight of PP resin (a2) having a melting point<br>
not lower than 125°C but not higher than 140°C with the<br>
total amount of PP resins (al) and (a2) being 100% by<br>
weight and that a difference in melting point between PP<br>
resins (al) and (a2) [(melting point of (a2)) - (melting<br>
point of (al))] be not less than 5°C but less than 15°C.<br>
When two PP resins (al) and (a2) are used in combination<br>
as PP resin (a), the PP resin (a) may additionally contain<br>
one or more resins (inclusive of polypropylene resin or<br>
resins) other than PP resins (al) and (a2) as long as the<br>
objects and effects of the present invention are not<br>
adversely affected.<br>
 <br>
[0032]<br>
PP resin (al), which has a relatively low melting<br>
point (higher than 110°C but not higher than 135°C),<br>
serves to lower the melt initiation temperature of PP<br>
beads (b) at the time of in-mold molding and to broaden<br>
the suitable temperature range for in-mold molding of PP<br>
beads (b) toward a low temperature side.  In other words,<br>
PP resin (al) serves to improve the fusion bonding<br>
efficiency of PP beads (b).  On the other hand, PP resin<br>
(a2), which has a higher melting point than that of PP<br>
resin (al) (not lower than 125°C but not higher than<br>
140°C), serves to improve the dimensional stability and<br>
heat resistance of PP beads (b) at the time of in-mold<br>
molding (and, therefore, dimensional stability and heat<br>
resistance of PP bead molding (c) obtained therefrom).<br>
The use of PP resin (al) having a melting point<br>
higher than 110°C but not higher than 135°C and PP resin<br>
(a2) having a melting point not lower than 125°C but not<br>
higher than 140°C as PP resin (a) is also preferred,<br>
because PP beads (b) made of such PP resin (a) can easily<br>
achieve the requirement that the resin melting point of PP<br>
beads (b) as determined from the second time DSC curve<br>
thereof must be not less than 120°C but less than 140°C.<br>
[0033]<br>
It is preferred that the difference in melting point<br>
between PP resins (al) and (a2) [(melting point of (a2)) -<br>
(melting point of (al))] be not less than 5°C but less<br>
than 15°C because of the following reasons. When the<br>
difference is not less than 5°C, the suitable temperature<br>
range for in-mold molding of PP beads (b) can be more<br>
broaden toward a low temperature side.  When difference is<br>
less than 15°C, the compatibility between PP resins (al)<br>
and (a2) can be maintained good and, additionally, good<br>
secondary expandability of PP beads (b) can be achieved.<br>
When the difference is 15°C or more, a uniform mixture of<br>
 <br>
PP resins (al) and (a2) is not easily obtainable by<br>
ordinary kneading procedures.  Further, there is a<br>
possibility that the effect of suppressing premature<br>
secondary expansion at the time of in-mold molding is so<br>
large that a foamed molded article obtained lacks surface<br>
smoothness.<br>
[0034]<br>
(ii) Method of measuring melting point<br>
The melting points of PP resins (al) and (a2) are<br>
measured by differential scanning calorimetry in<br>
accordance with JIS K7121-1987 in which a sample of 1 to 3<br>
mg of the PP resin is heated to 200°C at a heating rate of<br>
10°C/minute, then immediately cooled to 30°C at a rate of<br>
10°C/minute, and again heated from 30°C to 200°C at a<br>
heating rate of 10°C/minute to obtain a DSC curve. A peak<br>
temperature of the endothermic peak in the DSC curve is<br>
the melting point. When a plurality of endothermic peaks<br>
are present, a peak temperature of the endothermic peak<br>
having the largest peak area of all is the melting point.<br>
[0035]<br>
(iii) Preparation of PP resins (al) and (a2)<br>
PP resins (al) and (a2) may be each prepared as a<br>
propylene homopolymer or a copolymer of propylene with one<br>
or more copolymerizable comonomers such as ethylene and a-<br>
olefins having 4 to 20 carbon atoms.<br>
As the comonomer used for the production of PP resins<br>
(al) and (a2), there may be mentioned, for example,<br>
ethylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene and 4-<br>
methyl-1-butene.  Specific examples of PP resins (al) and<br>
(a2) include propylene-ethylene random copolymers,<br>
propylene-butene-1 random copolymers and propylene-<br>
ethylene-butene-1 random terpolymers.  The proportion of<br>
the comonomer in PP resins (al) and (a2) is properly<br>
selected in consideration of the desired resin melting<br>
point and mechanical strength of PP beads (b).  The<br>
 <br>
preferred proportion of the comonomer in PP resins (al)<br>
and (a2) also varies depending upon the catalyst such as<br>
Ziegler-Natta catalyst and metallocene polymerization<br>
catalyst used for the production of PP resins (al) and<br>
(a2) .<br>
[0036]<br>
The proportion of each of the monomer components<br>
used for copolymerization varies with the type of<br>
combination of PP resins (al) and (a2). When, for<br>
instance, a metallocene polymerization catalyst is used,<br>
the proportion of each of the monomer components is such<br>
that the content of ethylene units or/and C4 to C2o a-<br>
olefin units in PP resin (a2) is preferably 0.5 to 8% by<br>
weight, more preferably 1.0 to 7% by weight, while the<br>
content of ethylene units or/and C4 to C20  a-olefin units<br>
in PP resin (al) is preferably about 1.5 to 4 times the<br>
amount of the ethylene units or/and C4 to C2o a-olefin<br>
units in PP resin (a2).<br>
[0037]<br>
As PP resin (al), which has a melting point of<br>
higher than 110°C but not higher than 135°C, it is<br>
preferable to use a propylene-ethylene random copolymer, a<br>
propylene-butene-1 random copolymer or a propylene-<br>
ethylene-butene-1 random terpolymer each of which is<br>
obtained by copolymerizing propylene with a comonomer<br>
using a metallocene catalyst, since such a copolymer has<br>
excellent compatibility weigh PP resin (a2) having a<br>
melting point not lower than 125°C but not higher than<br>
140°C.<br>
[0038]<br>
It is preferred that at least one of PP resins (al)<br>
and (a2) be a polypropylene resin obtained using a<br>
metallocene polymerization catalyst, since PP resin (a)<br>
containing such PP resins (al) and (a2) has relatively a<br>
low melting point. Notwithstanding a reduced melting<br>
 <br>
point, PP resins obtained using a metallocene<br>
polymerization catalyst are able to have mechanical<br>
properties which are almost not reduced.  Further, it is<br>
preferred that PP resin (a) contain 50 to 80% by weight of<br>
PP resin (al) and 50 to 20% by weight of PP resin (a2)<br>
with the total amount of both being 100% by weight, since<br>
PP beads (b) made of such a mixed resin have both good<br>
fusion bonding efficiency and secondary expandability.<br>
When the content of PP resin (al) in PP resin (a) is<br>
50% by weight or more, the suitable temperature range for<br>
molding PP beads (b) in a mold cavity can be more<br>
broadened toward a low temperature side. A content of PP<br>
resin (al) in PP resin (a) of not more than 80% by weight<br>
can give PP bead molding (c) having better appearance and<br>
mechanical properties.<br>
[0039]<br>
(2-4) Other polymers<br>
PP resin (a) (inclusive of a mixture of PP resins<br>
(al) and (a2)) which is used as a base resin of PP beads<br>
(b) may contain other polymers and/or additives as long as<br>
the effects of the present invention are not adversely<br>
affected.<br>
Examples of the additional polymers include<br>
polyethylene resins such as high density polyethylenes,<br>
medium density polyethylenes, low density polyethylenes,<br>
linear low density polyethylenes, linear very low density<br>
polyethylenes, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers,<br>
ethylene-acrylic acid copolymers and ethylene-methacrylic<br>
copolymers; polystyrene resins such as polystyrene and<br>
styrene-maleic anhydride copolymers; rubbers such as<br>
ethylene-propylene rubber, ethylene-1-butene rubber,<br>
propylene-1-butene rubber, ethylene-propylene-diene rubber,<br>
isoprene rubber, neoprene rubber and nitrile rubber; and<br>
styrenic thermoplastic elastomers such as styrene-diene<br>
block copolymers and hydrogenated products of the styrene-<br>
 <br>
diene block copolymers.<br>
[0040]<br>
The above additional resins, rubbers and elastomers<br>
may be used singly or in combination of two or more<br>
thereof. The amount of the additional polymers is<br>
preferably 20 parts by weight or less, more preferably 10<br>
parts by weight or less, per 100 parts by weight of PP<br>
resin (a).<br>
The base resin of PP beads (b) may be either cross-<br>
linked or non-cross-linked.  From the standpoint of<br>
recyclability and productivity of PP beads (b), however,<br>
the use of non-cross-linked polypropylene resin is<br>
preferred.<br>
[0041]<br>
(2-5) Additives<br>
If desired, one or more additives, such as a cell<br>
diameter  controlling  agent,  an  antistatic  agent,  an<br>
electrical conductivity imparting agent, a lubricant, an<br>
antioxidant, a UV absorbing agent, a flame retardant, a<br>
metal-deactivator, a pigment, a dye, a nucleus agent and<br>
an inorganic filler, may be incorporated into PP resin (a).<br>
Examples of the cell diameter controlling agent include<br>
inorganic powders such as talc, calcium carbonate, silica,<br>
titanium oxide, gypsum, zeolite, borax, aluminum hydroxide<br>
and carbon black and organic  nucleus agents  such  as<br>
phosphorus-based,  phenol-based  and  amine-based  nucleus<br>
agents.  The amount of the additive varies with the object<br>
of incorporation but is generally 25 parts by weight or<br>
less,  preferably  15  parts  by  weight  or  less,  more<br>
preferably  8  parts  by  weight  or  less,  particularly<br>
preferably 5 parts by weight or less, per 100 parts by<br>
weight of the base resin.<br>
[0042]<br>
(2-6) Method of kneading PP resins (al) and (a2)<br>
A base resin containing PP resins (al) and (a2) is<br>
 <br>
kneaded together with optional ingredients such as other<br>
optional resins and/or additives into a homogeneous<br>
mixture. The kneading is carried out at a temperature<br>
sufficient to melt the resin components using a single<br>
screw extruder or multi-screw extruder such as a twin-<br>
screw extruder.  In this case, the extruder may be<br>
operated in a starvation mode, if desired, in order to<br>
uniformly knead a plurality of resins having different<br>
melting points or melt viscosities as described in<br>
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. JP-2006-69143-A.<br>
In the starvation mode operation, a feed rate of the raw<br>
material resin is adjusted by a volumetric feeder such<br>
that the discharge amount of the product is less than that<br>
in the flooded state when the screw speed is held constant.<br>
The discharge amount in the starved state is preferably 60<br>
to 80% of that of the flooded state.<br>
[0043]<br>
(2-7) Melt flow rate (MFR) of PP resins (al) and (a2)<br>
When a mixture of PP resins (al) and (a2) is used as<br>
PP resin (a) , it is preferred that at least one of PP<br>
resins (al) and (a2) have a melt flow rate, as measured in<br>
accordance with JIS K7210-1999, Test Condition M (at a<br>
temperature of 230°C and a load of 2.16 kg) of 20 g/10 min<br>
or more.  Such PP resin (a) can easily give PP beads (b)<br>
in one stage expansion.  The obtained PP beads (b) can be<br>
fusion-bonded  to  each  other with high  fusion bonding<br>
strength even when molded in a mold cavity at a low<br>
molding temperature.<br>
[0044]<br>
(3) Production of PP beads (b)<br>
The PP resin (a) and, if desired, one or more<br>
additives and additional polymers are pelletized by any<br>
suitable known method to obtain resin particles. For<br>
example, they are melted and kneaded in an extruder and<br>
extruded through a die into strands and cut to obtain the<br>
 <br>
resin particles or pellets. The resin particles (and PP<br>
beads (b) as well) generally have a mean weight per<br>
particle (per bead) of 0.01 to 10.0 mg, preferably 0.1 to<br>
5.0 mg.<br>
The obtained resin particles are then expanded using<br>
a blowing agent to obtain PP beads (b) by any known method<br>
disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Publications No.<br>
JP-S49-2183-B, No. JP-S56-1344-B and JP-S62-61227-B.  For<br>
example, PP beads (b) may be suitably prepared by a<br>
dispersion method in which the resin particles are<br>
dispersed in a dispersing medium, such as water, in an<br>
autoclave together with a physical blowing agent.  The<br>
resulting dispersion is heated with stirring to soften the<br>
resin particles and to impregnate the resin particles with<br>
the blowing agent and then discharged from the autoclave<br>
into a lower pressure atmosphere, generally atmospheric<br>
pressure, to foam and expand the resin particles and to<br>
obtain PP beads (b). When the dispersion is discharged to<br>
a low pressure atmosphere, it is preferred that a back<br>
pressure be applied to the autoclave using the blowing<br>
agent or an inorganic gas such as nitrogen or air to<br>
prevent the pressure inside the autoclave from being<br>
quickly reduced. This procedure is effective to produce<br>
PP beads (b) having a uniform apparent density.<br>
[0045]<br>
The PP beads (b) discharged into the low pressure<br>
atmosphere are aged in the atmosphere.  If desired, the PP<br>
beads (b) may be treated with a pressurized gas such as<br>
air in a closed vessel to increase the pressure inside the<br>
cells thereof to 0.01 to 0.6 MPa(G).  The treated PP beads<br>
(b) are taken out of the closed vessel and then heated<br>
with steam or hot air to reduce the apparent density<br>
thereof. The above treatment to reduce the apparent<br>
density will be hereinafter occasionally referred to as<br>
"second stage expansion".<br>
 <br>
[0046]<br>
(3-1) Blowing agent<br>
The blowing agent used in the above dispersion<br>
method may be an organic physical blowing agent, an<br>
inorganic physical blowing agent or a mixture thereof.<br>
Examples of the organic physical blowing agent include<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbons such as propane, butane, pentane,<br>
hexane and heptane, alicyclic hydrocarbons such as<br>
cyclobutane and cyclohexane, halogenated hydrocarbons such<br>
as chlorofluoromethane, trifluoromethane, 1,1,1,2-<br>
tetrafluoroethane, methyl chloride, ethyl chloride and<br>
methylene chloride, and dialkyl ethers such as dimethyl<br>
ether, diethyl ether and methyl ethyl ether. Examples of<br>
the inorganic physical blowing agent include nitrogen,<br>
carbon dioxide, argon, air and water. These blowing<br>
agents may be used singly or in combination of two or more<br>
thereof. When the organic physical blowing agent and<br>
inorganic physical blowing agent are used in combination,<br>
the above-exemplified organic and inorganic physical<br>
blowing agents may be arbitrarily selected and combined.<br>
In this case, it is preferred that the inorganic physical<br>
blowing agent is used in an amount of 30% by weight or<br>
more based on the total amount of the organic and<br>
inorganic physical blowing agents.<br>
[0047]<br>
From the standpoint of environmental problem, the<br>
use of an inorganic blowing agent, particularly nitrogen,<br>
air, carbon dioxide or water is preferred. When water is<br>
used as a dispersing medium for dispersing the resin<br>
particles for the production of PP beads (b) by the above-<br>
described dispersion method, the water may be also used as<br>
a blowing agent. In this case, a water absorbing resin<br>
may be suitably incorporated into the base resin of the<br>
resin particles.<br>
The  amount  of  the  blowing  agent  is  suitably<br>
 <br>
determined in consideration of the intended expansion<br>
ratio (apparent density) of the expanded beads, kind of<br>
the base resin and the kind of the blowing agent. The<br>
organic and inorganic physical blowing agents are<br>
generally used in amounts of 5 to 50 parts by weight and<br>
0.5 to 30 parts by weight, respectively, per 100 parts by<br>
weight of the resin particles.<br>
[0048]<br>
(3-2) Dispersing medium and dispersing agent<br>
Any liquid in which the resin particles are<br>
insoluble may be used as the dispersing medium. Examples<br>
of the dispersing medium include water, ethylene glycol,<br>
glycerin, methanol, ethanol and mixtures thereof. The<br>
dispersing medium is preferably water or an aqueous<br>
dispersing medium.<br>
A dispersing agent of a water insoluble or sparingly<br>
water insoluble inorganic substance such as aluminum oxide,<br>
tribasic calcium phosphate, magnesium pyrophosphate, zinc<br>
oxide and kaolin, and a dispersing aid of an anionic<br>
surfactant such as sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate and<br>
sodium alkanesulfonate may be suitably incorporated in the<br>
dispersing medium. The amount of the dispersing agent is<br>
preferably such that a weight ratio of the resin particles<br>
to the dispersing agent is in the range of 20 to 2,000,<br>
particularly 30 to 1,000.  The amount of the dispersing<br>
aid is such that a weight ratio of the dispersing agent to<br>
the dispersing aid is 0.1 to 500, particularly 1 to 50.<br>
[0049]<br>
(3-3)   Production  of  PP  beads   (b)   by  isothermal<br>
crystallization<br>
It is preferred that an isothermal crystallization<br>
treatment be carried out during the course of the<br>
production of PP beads (b) so that PP beads (b) gives a<br>
first time DSC curve which satisfies the following two<br>
conditions; i.e. (1) the first time DSC curve has a<br>
 <br>
plurality of endothermic peaks, and (2) the sum of the<br>
calorific values of the endothermic peak or peaks having a<br>
peak temperature of between 120°C and 135°C is 50 to 90%<br>
of the total calorific value of the plurality of<br>
endothermic peaks.  PP beads (b) satisfying the above<br>
conditions may afford PP bead molding (c) having excellent<br>
physical properties.  The isothermal crystallization<br>
treatment can form secondary crystals which account for<br>
the endothermic peak or peaks which are present on a high<br>
temperature side of the intrinsic endothermic peak in the<br>
first time DSC curve of PP beads (b).<br>
[0050]<br>
In the isothermal crystallization treatment, the<br>
dispersion in a closed vessel containing the resin<br>
particles is held at an arbitrary temperature (Ta) between<br>
a temperature lower by 15°C than the melting point (Tm) of<br>
PP resin (a) and a temperature lower than the melt<br>
completion point of the resin particles (Te) for a period<br>
of time sufficient to grow secondary crystals, preferably<br>
5 to 60 minutes. After controlling the temperature of the<br>
dispersion to a temperature (Tb) which is between (Tm -<br>
5°C) and (Te + 5°C), the dispersion is discharged from the<br>
vessel to a low pressure atmosphere to foam and expand the<br>
resin particles.<br>
The temperature (Ta) at which the dispersion is held<br>
in the isothermal crystallization step may be increased<br>
stepwise or continuously between (Tm - 15°C) and Te to<br>
grow the secondary crystals.<br>
The melting point (Tm) of PP resin (a) used as a<br>
base resin of PP beads (b) , the resin melting point (TmA)<br>
of PP beads (b) as determined from the second time DSC<br>
curve, and the peak temperature (PTmA) of the intrinsic<br>
endothermic peak which is present on a low temperature<br>
side in the first time DSC curve (described hereinafter)<br>
are close to each other.  Therefore, from TmA or PTmA, the<br>
 <br>
melting point (Tm) of PP resin (a) may be well estimated.<br>
[0051]<br>
Similar to the above-described resin melting point<br>
(TmA) , the melting point (Tm) of PP resin (a) may be<br>
determined from a DSC curve obtained by heat flux<br>
differential scanning calorimetry in accordance with JIS<br>
K7121-1987 in which a sample of 1 to 3 mg of PP resin (a)<br>
is heated to 200°C at a heating rate of 10°C/minute, then<br>
immediately cooled from 200°C to 30°C at a rate of<br>
10°C/minute, and again heated from 30°C to 200°C at a<br>
heating rate of 10°C/minute to obtain the DSC curve. The<br>
melting point is a peak temperature of the endothermic<br>
peak in the DSC curve. When there are a plurality of<br>
endothermic peaks, the melting point is a peak temperature<br>
of the endothermic peak having the largest peak area.<br>
[0052]<br>
The formation of secondary crystals and the<br>
calorific value of the endothermic peak attributed to the<br>
fusion of the secondary crystals mainly depend upon the<br>
afore-mentioned temperature Ta at which the dispersion is<br>
maintained before expansion treatment, the length of time<br>
for which the dispersion is maintained at the temperature<br>
Ta, the afore-mentioned temperature Tb, and the heating<br>
rate at which the dispersion is heated within the range of<br>
(Tm - 15°C) and (Te + 5°C). The calorific value of the<br>
endothermic peak attributed to the fusion of the second<br>
crystals increases (i) as temperatures Ta and Tb are<br>
lowered within the above-specified ranges, (ii) as the<br>
holding time in the range of between (Tm - 15°C) and Te<br>
increases, and (iii) as the heating rate in the<br>
temperature range of between (Tm - 15°C) and Te decreases.<br>
The heating rate is generally 0.5 to 5°C per minute.<br>
The calorific value of the endothermic peak<br>
attributed to the fusion of the second crystals decreases<br>
(i) as temperatures Ta and Tb increase within the above-<br>
 <br>
specified ranges, (ii) as the holding time in the range of<br>
between(Tm - 15°C) and Te decreases, (iii) as the heating<br>
rate in the temperature range of between (Tm - 15°C) and<br>
Te increases and (iv) as the heating rate in the<br>
temperature range of between Te and (Te + 5°C) decreases.<br>
Suitable conditions for the preparation of PP beads (b)<br>
having desired heat of fusion of the endothermic peak<br>
attributed to the fusion of the secondary crystals can be<br>
determined by preliminary experiments on the basis of the<br>
above points.<br>
The above temperature range for the formation of the<br>
endothermic peak attributed to the fusion of the secondary<br>
crystals are suitably adopted in the case where an<br>
inorganic physical blowing agent is used. When an organic<br>
physical blowing agent is used, the suitable temperature<br>
range will shift toward the low temperature side (lower by<br>
0 to 30°C) and vary with the kind and amount of the<br>
organic physical blowing agent.<br>
[0053]<br>
(3-4) Calorific value of endothermic peak in first time<br>
DSC curve of PP beads (b)<br>
The total calorific value AH of the endothermic peak<br>
or peaks of the first time DSC curve of PP beads (b) is<br>
determined as follows.<br>
FIG. 1 is an explanatory view of a first time DSC<br>
curve of expanded beads. A  straight line (α-β) extending<br>
between the point a on the curve at 80°C and the point β<br>
on the curve at a melt completion temperature Te of the<br>
resin is drawn.   The area defined by the DSC curve and<br>
the line (α-β) corresponds to the total calorific value AH<br>
J/g  The total calorific value AH may be automatically<br>
computed by a differential scanning calorimeter on the<br>
basis of the peak area.	.<br>
The total calorific value AH of PP beads  (b)  is<br>
preferably in the range of 40 to 120 J/g, more preferably<br>
 <br>
45 to 100 J/g, particularly preferably 45 to 85 J/g.<br>
The  calorific  values  H1,   H2,   H3   ...   of<br>
endothermic peaks x1, x2, x3 ... may be determined by the<br>
partial area analysis as described previously.<br>
[0054]<br>
It is preferred that PP beads (b) give such a first<br>
time DSC curve in which a plurality of endothermic peaks<br>
are present and the sum of the calorific values of the<br>
endothermic peak or peaks having a peak temperature of not<br>
lower than 120°C but not higher than 135°C is 50 to 90% of<br>
the total calorific value of the plurality of endothermic<br>
peaks, since the secondary expandability of PP beads (b)<br>
is excellent and PP bead molding obtained therefrom has<br>
excellent mechanical strength and heat resistance. The<br>
first time DSC curve is obtained by heat flux differential<br>
scanning calorimetry in accordance with JIS K7122-1987 in<br>
which a sample of 1 to 3 mg of the PP beads (b) is heated<br>
from ambient temperature to 200°C at a heating rate of<br>
10°C/minute. In the first time DSC curve having a<br>
plurality of endothermic peaks, the number of the<br>
endothermic peak having a peak temperature of not lower<br>
than 120°C but not higher than 135°C may be only one or<br>
may be two or more. FIG. 1 is an explanatory view of a<br>
first time DSC curve of expanded beads in which the<br>
endothermic peak x1 having a peak temperature PTmA is the<br>
only peak that is present in the temperature range of not<br>
lower than 120°C but not higher than 135°C.<br>
[0055]<br>
It is also preferred that PP beads (b) show such a<br>
first time DSC curve in which an endothermic peak having a<br>
peak temperature PTmA is present in a temperature range of<br>
not lower than 120°C but not higher than 135°C for reasons<br>
of improved heat resistance and capability of reducing the<br>
in-mold molding temperature. It is further preferred that<br>
PP beads (b) give such a first time DSC curve in which the<br>
 <br>
sum of the calorific values of the endothermic peak or<br>
peaks having a peak temperature of not lower than 120°C<br>
but not higher than 135°C is 50 to 90% of the total<br>
calorific value AH of the plurality of endothermic peaks,<br>
for reasons of excellent balance between the physical<br>
properties such as mechanical strength and heat resistance<br>
of PP bead molding (c) obtained therefrom and the in-mold<br>
moldability of PP beads (b) at a low temperature.<br>
[0056]<br>
PP beads (b) providing such a first time DSC curve<br>
in which a plurality of endothermic peaks are present may<br>
be obtained by using a plurality of polypropylene resins<br>
as a base resin thereof. Further, the first time DSC<br>
curve of PP beads may show a plurality of endothermic<br>
peaks when a dispersion containing unexpanded resin<br>
particles is subjected to the above-described isothermal<br>
crystallization treatment. The isothermal crystallization<br>
treatment may also increase the calorific value of the<br>
endothermic peak on a higher temperature side. Thus, it<br>
is possible to adjust the sum of the calorific values of<br>
endothermic peaks having a peak temperature between 12 0°C<br>
and 135°C to 50 to 90% of a total calorific value of all<br>
of the endothermic peaks particularly by the isothermal<br>
crystallization treatment. The calorific value of the<br>
endothermic peak formed by the isothermal crystallization<br>
treatment is preferably 2 to 30 J/g, more preferably 5 to<br>
20 J/g.<br>
[0057]<br>
Whether the presence of a plurality of endothermic<br>
peaks in a first time DSC curve of PP beads is attributed<br>
to an isothermal crystallization treatment or not may be<br>
known from the results of a second time DSC curve thereof<br>
as explained below with reference to FIGS. 3 and 4.<br>
Let us assume that the first time DSC curve as shown<br>
in FIG. 3 is obtained by differential scanning calorimetry<br>
 <br>
in which 1 to 3 mg of PP beads are heated at a heating<br>
rate of 10°C/min to 200°C and that the second time DSC<br>
curve as shown in FIG. 4 is obtained by the differential<br>
scanning calorimetry in which the sample after the first<br>
heating is immediately cooled from 200°C to 30°C at a<br>
cooling rate of 10°C/min and is then immediately heated<br>
from 30°C to 200°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min.  It will<br>
be noted that the endothermic peak is present at about<br>
139°C in the first DSC curve shown in FIG. 3, while such<br>
an endothermic peak is not present in the second DSC curve<br>
shown in FIG. 4.    The endothermic peak which exists in the<br>
first DSC curve but disappears in the second DSC curve is<br>
the peak formed as a result of an isothermal<br>
crystallization treatment.  The other peaks are those<br>
inherent to the polypropylene resin.<br>
[0058]<br>
(3-5) Average cell diameter<br>
PP beads (b) generally have an average cell diameter<br>
of 30  to 500 urn, preferably 50 to 350 urn.  PP beads (b)<br>
having the above average cell diameter have cells walls<br>
with high strength so that the cells are not destroyed<br>
during the second stage expansion and in-mold molding and,<br>
thus, PP beads (b) show good secondary expandability. As<br>
used herein, the average cell diameter of PP beads (b) is<br>
as measured by the following method. An expanded bead is<br>
cut into nearly equal halves and the cross-section is<br>
photographed using an electron microscope.  On the<br>
photograph, four straight lines each passing the center of<br>
the cross-section are drawn in a radial pattern.  Each of<br>
the four straight lines intersects the outer circumference<br>
of the bead at two intersection points. The length<br>
between the intersection points of each of the four<br>
straight lines is measured and the sum L (urn) of the four<br>
lengths is calculated.  Further, the number (N) of the<br>
cells located on the four straight lines is counted.  The<br>
 <br>
average cell diameter of the bead is obtained by dividing<br>
the length L by the number N (L/N).<br>
[0059]<br>
The average cell diameter increases with an increase<br>
of the melt flow rate of the base resin, an increase of<br>
the expansion temperature at which resin particles are<br>
foamed and expanded, a decrease of the amount of the<br>
blowing agent, a decrease of the cell diameter controlling<br>
agent and an increase of the size of the resin particles.<br>
PP beads (b) having a desired average cell diameter may be<br>
obtained by adjusting the above factors.<br>
The cell diameter controlling agent such as talc,<br>
aluminum hydroxide, silica, zeolite and borax is<br>
preferably incorporated into resin particles in an amount<br>
of 0.01 to 5 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of<br>
the base resin. The average cell diameter varies with the<br>
expansion temperature and the kind and amount of the<br>
blowing agent. Suitable conditions for the preparation of<br>
PP beads (b) having desired average cell diameter can be<br>
determined by preliminary experiments on the basis of the<br>
above points.<br>
[0060]<br>
[2] Embodiment-II (PP bead molding (c))<br>
(1) In-mold molding method<br>
PP bead molding (c) is obtained by a batch molding<br>
method in which expanded PP beads (b) (if desired, after<br>
being treated to increase the inside pressure of the cells<br>
to 0.01 to 0.2 MPa(G) in the same manner as that in the<br>
afore-mentioned two stage expansion) are filled in an<br>
ordinary mold for use in in-mold molding of thermoplastic<br>
resin expanded beads which is adapted to be heated and<br>
cooled and to be opened and closed. After closing the<br>
mold, saturated steam with a saturation vapor pressure of<br>
0.05 to 0.25 MPa(G), preferably 0.08 to 0.20 MPa(G), is<br>
fed to the mold to heat and fuse-bond PP beads (b)<br>
 <br>
together. The mold is then cooled and opened to take PP<br>
bead molding (c) out of the mold.  Details of such an in-<br>
mold molding method is disclosed in, for example, Japanese<br>
Patent Publications No. JP-H04-46217-B and No. JP-H06-<br>
49795-B.<br>
[0061]<br>
In the above in-mold molding method, PP beads (b) in<br>
the mold cavity may be heated with steam by suitably<br>
combining heating methods including one-direction flow<br>
heating, reversed one-direction flow heating and both-<br>
direction heating. One preferred heating method includes<br>
preheating, one-direction flow heating, reversed one-<br>
direction flow heating and both-direction heating<br>
successively performed in this order. The above<br>
saturation vapor pressure of 0.05 to 0.25 MPa(G) used for<br>
in-mold molding is intended to refer to the maximum of the<br>
saturation vapor pressure of steam.<br>
The PP bead molding (c) may be also produced by a<br>
continuous molding method in which PP beads (b) (if<br>
necessary, after being treated to increase the inside<br>
pressure of the cells to 0.01 to 0.2 MPa(G)) are fed to a<br>
mold space which is defined between a pair of vertically<br>
spaced, continuously running belts.  During the passage<br>
through a steam-heating zone, saturated steam with a<br>
saturation vapor pressure of 0.05 to 0.25 MPa(G) is fed to<br>
the mold space so that PP beads (b) are foamed, expanded<br>
and fuse-bonded together. The resulting molded article is<br>
cooled in a cooling zone, discharged from the mold space<br>
and successively cut to a desired length to obtain PP bead<br>
moldings (c).  The above continuous method is disclosed in,<br>
for example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publications Nos.<br>
JP-H09-104026-A, JP-H09-104027-A and JP-H10-180888-A.<br>
[0062]<br>
When conventional expanded polypropylene resin beads<br>
 <br>
are used, although the degree of difficulty depends upon<br>
the shape of the foamed molded article, it is generally-<br>
difficult to obtain a practically acceptable foamed molded<br>
article having an apparent density of 30 g/L or less<br>
unless a specific molding method, such as a method in<br>
which expanded beads are pretreated to increase the inside<br>
pressure thereof or a method in which expanded beads<br>
having an apparent density 20 g/L or less are press-filled<br>
in a mold cavity at a high compression ratio, is adopted.<br>
PP beads (b) according to the present invention, on the<br>
other hand, can give excellent PP bead molding (c) without<br>
resorting to such a pressurizing or compressing treatment.<br>
Further, PP beads (b) according to the present invention<br>
can give excellent PP bead molding (c) using a lower<br>
molding pressure than that employed in the conventional<br>
method.<br>
[0063]<br>
(2) PP bead molding (c) obtained by in-mold molding<br>
When PP beads (b) in a mold cavity are heated with<br>
steam, surfaces of PP beads (b) are melted so that they<br>
first begin fusion-bonding to each other.  Then, PP beads<br>
(b) are softened, foamed and expanded. Thus, because the<br>
secondary expansion is preceded by fusion-bonding, the<br>
obtained PP bead molding (c) has excellent appearance and<br>
high fusion-bonding between beads.  Even if PP beads (b)<br>
in the mold cavity fail to be uniformly heated with steam,<br>
good PP bead molding (c) can be obtained because the<br>
temperature range suitable for molding is wide enough.<br>
In PP bead molding (c) of the present invention, the<br>
beads are tightly fusion-bonded together and are not<br>
debonded from each other.  Further, PP bead molding (c)<br>
has excellent compressive strength, flexibility, low<br>
permanent compression set, smooth surface free of<br>
undulation and excellent dimensional stability.  Even when<br>
PP bead molding (c) has a large thickness, the beads in<br>
 <br>
the inner central portion are highly fusion-bonded to each<br>
other.<br>
[0064]<br>
PP bead molding (c) preferably has a closed cell<br>
content in accordance with ASTM-D2856-70, Procedure C of<br>
40% or less, more preferably 30% or less, most preferably<br>
25% or less, for reasons of high mechanical strength.  The<br>
apparent density of PP bead molding (c) is preferably 10<br>
to 300 g/L, more preferably 13 to 180 g/L, for reasons of<br>
high mechanical strength, excellent cushioning property<br>

molding (c) may be obtained by dividing the weight (g)<br>
thereof by the volume (L) thereof determined from its<br>
dimension.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0065]<br>
The present invention will be further described in<br>
detail by way of examples.  It should be noted, however,<br>
that the present invention is not limited to the examples<br>
in any way.<br>
Evaluation methods adopted in the examples are as<br>
follows. A DSC apparatus used in Examples and Comparative<br>
Examples is DSC-Q1000 (trade name) manufactured by T A<br>
Instrument, Japan.<br>
[0066]<br>
(1) Evaluation method<br>
(1-1) Base resin<br>
(i) Melting point of base resin<br>
The method described above in "[1] Embodiment-I (PP<br>
beads (b)), (2) PP resin (a), (2-3) PP resin (a) of mixed<br>
resins, (ii) Method of measuring melting point" was<br>
adopted.<br>
(1-2) Expanded beads<br>
(i) Measurement of resin melting point of expanded beads<br>
 <br>
The method described above in "[1] Embodiment-I (PP<br>
beads (b) ), (1) PP beads (b), (1-1) Resin melting point<br>
of PP beads (b) determined from DSC curve" was adopted.<br>
(ii) Measurement of calorific values of endothermic peaks<br>
(AH1, AH120-135) in first time DSC curve of expanded beads<br>
The method described above in "[1] Embodiment-I (PP<br>
beads (b)), (3) Production of PP beads (b), (3-4)<br>
Calorific value of endothermic peak in first time DSC<br>
curve of PP beads (b)" was adopted.<br>
(iii) Apparent density p1 and apparent density ratio pR of<br>
expanded beads<br>
The method described above in "[1] Embodiment-I (PP<br>
beads (b) ), (1) PP beads (b), (1-2) Ratio pR of apparent<br>
densities before and after heating of PP beads (b)" was<br>
adopted.<br>
[0067]<br>
(iv)  Measurement of steam pressure required for fusion<br>
bonding (minimum steam pressure)<br>
The minimum steam pressure was measured as follows.<br>
From the first time DSC curve of expanded beads, the<br>
lowest temperature required for fusing surfaces of the<br>
expanded beads is estimated. The expanded beads are then<br>
molded in a mold cavity having a dimension of 250 mm long,<br>
250 mm wide and 100 mm thick using steam having a<br>
temperature equal to the estimated temperature.  The<br>
obtained foamed molded article is measured for its fusion<br>
bonding rate. When the fusion bonding rate is less than<br>
50%, in mold molding of the expanded beads is carried out<br>
in the same manner as above except that steam pressure is<br>
increased by 0.01 MPa.  The obtained foamed molded article<br>
is measured for its fusion bonding rate.  Similar in-mold<br>
molding of the expanded beads is repeated until the fusion<br>
bonding rate become 50% or more.  In the above-described<br>
manner, the minimum saturation vapor pressure of steam at<br>
which the fusion bonding rate is 50% or more is determined.<br>
 <br>
This minimum steam pressure is the minimum steam pressure<br>
required for fusion bonding of the expanded beads.<br>
The above "fusion bonding rate" of the foamed molded<br>
article is as determined by the following method.  The<br>
obtained foamed molded article is bent in the length or<br>
width direction and broken into nearly equal halves.  The<br>
exposed interface along which the halves have been<br>
separated is observed to count a total number CI of the<br>
beads present on the interface and the number C2 of the<br>
destroyed beads. The fusion bonding rate is a percentage<br>
of the destroyed beads (C2/C1 x 100).<br>
(v) Average cell diameter<br>
The method described above in "[1] Embodiment-I (PP<br>
beads (b)), (3) Production of PP beads (b), (3-5) Average<br>
cell diameter" was adopted.<br>
[0068]<br>
(1-3) Foamed molded article<br>
(i) Inside fusion bonding<br>
Expanded beads without any pretreatment such as the<br>
above-described inside pressure increasing treatment were<br>
molded in a mold cavity having a dimension of 250 mm long,<br>
250 mm wide and 100 mm thick.  The obtained foamed molded<br>
article was aged and dried in an oven at 80°C for 12 hours,<br>
from which a test piece having a dimension of 70 mm long,<br>
70 mm wide and 100 mm thick (thickness of the foamed<br>
molded article) was cut out from the center region thereof.<br>
The test piece was then bent and broken into halves each<br>
having about 50 mm thickness.  The exposed interface along<br>
which the halves have been separated was observed to count<br>
a total number CI of the beads present on the interface<br>
and the number C2 of the destroyed beads, from which a<br>
fusion bonding rate was calculated as a percentage of the<br>
destroyed beads (C2/C1 * 100).  Inside fusion bonding is<br>
evaluated according to the following ratings:<br>
A (good): Fusion bonding rate is 50% or more<br>
 <br>
C (no good): Fusion bonding rate is less than 50%<br>
[0069]<br>
(ii) Appearance<br>
Appearance of foamed molded article was observed<br>
with naked eyes and evaluated according to the following<br>
ratings:<br>
A : No or almost no surface undulations or voids between<br>
beads are observed<br>
B: Slight surface undulations and/or voids between beads<br>
are observed<br>
C: Significant surface undulations and/or voids between<br>
beads are observed<br>
(iii) Dimensional stability<br>
A foamed molded article after aging (at80 °C for 12<br>
hours) was measured for its length, width and thickness,<br>
from which differences from the corresponding length,<br>
width and thickness dimension of the mold cavity were<br>
calculated in terms of percentages.  The obtained<br>
percentages were averaged to obtain a dimensional<br>
difference (%) from the mold cavity. The dimensional<br>
stability was evaluated according to the following<br>
ratings:<br>
A: Dimensional difference is less than 4%<br>
B: Dimensional difference is 4% or more but no reduction<br>
of the thickness in the central region of the foamed<br>
molded article is observed<br>
C: Dimensional difference is 4% or more and the thickness<br>
in the central region of the foamed molded article is<br>
apparently reduced<br>
[0070]<br>
(2) Base resin used in Examples and Comparative Examples<br>
The base resins used in Examples and Comparative<br>
Examples and physical properties thereof are shown in<br>
Table 1.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Examples 1 to 7<br>
(1) Preparation of expanded polypropylene resin beads<br>
Two polypropylene resins were selected from those<br>
shown in Table 1 as a base resin and used in the mixing<br>
ratios as shown in Table 2. The base resin was kneaded<br>
together with 500 ppm by weight of zinc borate in a single<br>
screw extruder with 65 mm internal diameter and the<br>
kneaded mass was extruded through a die attached to a tip<br>
of the extruder into strands. The strands were<br>
immediately introduced in water vessel for quenching. The<br>
cooled strands were cut into particles each having a mean<br>
weight of about 1 mg and dried to obtain resin particles.<br>
 <br>
[0073]<br>
In a 5 L autoclave, 1 kg of the above resin<br>
particles were charged together with 3 L of water<br>
(dispersing medium), 0.3 part by weight of kaolin<br>
(dispersing agent), 0.004 part by weight of sodium<br>
alkylbenzenesulfonate (surfactant), and 0.01 part by<br>
weight of aluminum sulfate. Then, 8 parts by weight of<br>
carbon dioxide (blowing agent) were fed to the autoclave<br>
under pressure.  The dispersion in the autoclave was<br>
heated to the expansion temperature shown in Table 2 and<br>
maintained at that temperature for 15 minutes to carry out<br>
an isothermal crystallization treatment for obtaining<br>
desired calorific value of a high temperature peak.  Then,<br>
one end of the autoclave was opened to discharge the<br>
dispersion to the atmosphere to obtain expanded beads.<br>
The above "parts by weight" for the using amount of the<br>
dispersing agent, surfactant, aluminum sulfate and blowing<br>
agent is "per 100 parts by weight of the resin particles".<br>
The obtained expanded beads were measured for DSC<br>
characteristics, apparent density p1 and apparent density<br>
ratio pR before and after heating the expanded beads. The<br>
total calorific value AH and calorific value AH120-135 of<br>
peaks having a peak temperature of between 120°C and 135°C<br>
in the first time DSC curve of expanded beads, resin<br>
melting point as determined from the second time DSC curve,<br>
apparent density p1 of the expanded beads and apparent<br>
density ratio pR of the expanded beads are shown in Table<br>
2.<br>
The first time DSC curve of the expanded beads<br>
obtained in Example 1 is shown in FIG. 3, and the second<br>
time DSC curve of the expanded beads obtained in Example 1<br>
is shown in FIG. 4.  In FIG. 3, the endothermic peak<br>
having a peak temperature of 125°C is inherent to the<br>
mixed resin (resins No. 3 and No. 5) used in Example 1,<br>
while the endothermic peak having a peak temperature of<br>
 <br>
about 139°C is attributed to the fusion of the secondary<br>
crystals formed by the isothermic crystallization<br>
treatment in the production process of the expanded beads.<br>
In FIG. 4, the endothermic peak attributed to the fusion<br>
of the secondary crystals disappear, while the intrinsic<br>
endothermic peaks inherent to the mixed resin (resins No.<br>
3 and No. 5) exist at peak temperatures of about 131°C and<br>
about 124°C.<br>
[0074]<br>
(2) Preparation of foamed molded article<br>
The expanded beads obtained above were filled in a<br>
mold cavity having a dimension of 250 mm long, 250 mm wide<br>
and 100 mm thick and molded with steam at the molding<br>
pressure (saturation vapor pressure of steam) shown in<br>
Table 2 to obtain a thick foamed molded product.  The<br>
molded product was then aged in an oven at 80°C for 12<br>
hours to obtain PP bead molding (c). The density and<br>
results of evaluation of inside fusion bonding, appearance<br>
and dimensional stability of PP bead molding (c) are<br>
summarized in Table 2.<br>
[0075]<br>
Comparative Examples 1 to 9<br>
(1)	Preparation of expanded polypropylene resin beads<br>
Expanded polypropylene resin beads were produced in<br>
the same manner as described in Examples 1 to 7 except<br>
that the combination and mixing ratio of the two<br>
polypropylene resins were changed as shown in Table 2.<br>
The AH and AH120-135 determined from the first time DSC<br>
curve of expanded beads, resin melting point as determined<br>
from the second time DSC curve, apparent density p1 and<br>
apparent density ratio pR before and after the heating of<br>
the expanded beads are shown in Table 2.<br>
(2)	Preparation of foamed molded article<br>
The thus obtained expanded beads were molded in the<br>
same manner as that in Examples 1 to 7 to obtain a thick<br>
 <br>
foamed molded product. The molded product was then aged<br>
in an oven at 80°C for 12 hours to obtain a foamed molded<br>
article. The density and results of evaluation of inside<br>
fusion bonding, appearance and dimensional stability of<br>
the foamed molded article are summarized in Table 2.<br>
[0076]<br>
Results of evaluation<br>
(i) Examples 1 to 7<br>
The expanded beads of Examples 1 to 7 which satisfy<br>
the required features of the present invention can give PP<br>
bead molding (c) having good fusion bonding between beads<br>
in spite of the fact that the in-mold molding is carried<br>
out at a low molding pressure.  In Example 7, the molding<br>
pressure is slightly high because each of the<br>
polypropylene resins (No. 2 and No. 4) has MFR of less<br>
than 20 g/10 min.<br>
[0077]<br>
(ii) Comparative Examples 1 to 5<br>
The results of Comparative Examples 1 to 5 indicate<br>
that the expanded beads having a density ratio pR of 1.6<br>
or more cannot produce a foamed molded article having good<br>
fusion bonding, irrespective of whether the resin melting<br>
point as determined from the second time DSC curve of the<br>
expanded beads is within the specified range of the<br>
present invention or not. As usual, the molding pressure<br>
in each of Examples and Comparative Examples was set based<br>
on the resin melting point of the expanded polypropylene<br>
resin beads.  In Comparative Example 1, since the resin<br>
melting point is high and outside the specified range, a<br>
high molding pressure is needed,<br>
(iii) Comparative Example 6<br>
Comparative Example 6 uses the same resins (Resins<br>
No. 3 and No. 5) as Examples 1, 2, 4 and 5.  However, the<br>
mixing ratio of these resins differs from that of Examples<br>
1, 2, 4 and 5 so that apparent density ratio pR is greater<br>
 <br>
than 1.6.  The inside fusion bonding is no good.<br>
(iv) Comparative Example 7<br>
Comparative Example 7 uses the same resins (Resins<br>
No. 2 and No. 4) as Example 7 does.  However, the mixing<br>
ratio of these resins differs from that of Example 7 so<br>
that apparent density ratio pR is greater than 1.6.  The<br>
inside fusion bonding is no good,<br>
(v) Comparative Example 8<br>
Comparative Example 8 uses a mixture of two resins.<br>
However, the difference in melting point between the two<br>
resins is only 3°C so that apparent density ratio pR is<br>
greater than 1.6. The inside fusion bonding is no good,<br>
(iv) Comparative Example 9<br>
Comparative Example 9 uses a mixture of two resins.<br>
However, the difference in melting point between the two<br>
resins is as large as 17°C so that apparent density ratio<br>
pR is greater than 1.6.  The inside fusion bonding and<br>
appearance (surface evenness) are no good.  Further, the<br>
minimum steam pressure is high.<br>
