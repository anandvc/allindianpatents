The present invention relates to a method of production of a polyvinyl ether compound.<br>
More particularly,  the present invention relates  to (1)  a<br><br>
producing a useful ether compound having a wide range of applicat'ons<br>
as solvent, lubricating oil and the like by hydrogenation of an acetal<br>
compound   or   a   ketal   compound;   and   (4)  a   novel   polyvinyl   ether<br>
;	compound useful as lubricating oil for compression-type refrigerators,<br><br>
electric insulation oil, organic solvent, surface active agent and the like.<br>
2. Description of the Related Arts<br>
Compression-type refrigerators are generally constituted with a compressor, a condenser, an expansion valve and an evaporat64" and has a structure that mixed fluid of refrigerant and lubricating oil is circulated in this closed system. In the compression-type refrigerator generally the temperature is high in the compressor and low in the refrigerating chamber and it Is generally required that the refrigerant and the lubricating oil are circulated in the system without causing phase separation in the wide range of temperature. When the phase separation occurs during the operation of the refrigerator, the life and the efficiency of the apparatus are adversely affected to a great extent. For example, when the phase separation of the refrigerant and the lubricating oil occurs in the part of the compressor, the lubrication of the moving parts is deteriorated and the seizure occurs to cause decrease of the life of the apparatus to a great extent. When the phase separation occurs in the evaporator, the efficiency of heat exchange is decreased because of the presence of the lubricating oil of high viscosity.<br>
Because the lubricating oil for refrigerators is used for the purpose of lubricating moving parts in refrigerators, the lubricating property is naturally important. Particularly, because the temperature in the compressor is high, the viscosity which can hold the oil film necessary for the lubrication is important. The required viscosity is diiierent depending on the kind of the compressor used and the conditions of use<br><br>
and it is generally preferable that the viscosity (kinematic viscosity) of the lubricating oil before mixing with the refrigerant is 5 to 1000 cSt at 40C. When the viscosity is lower than this range, the oil film becomes thin to cause insufficient lubrication, and, when the viscosity is higher than this range, the efficiency of the heat exchange is decreased.<br>
Electric refrigerators have the motor and the compressor built into a single body and the lubricating oil for them is required to have a high degree of electric insulating property. In general, a volume specific resistance of 102 Jicm or more at 80Â°C is required. When the resistance is lower than this value, the possibility of the leak of electricity arises.<br>
As the refrigerant for compressor-type refrigerators, mainly Flon 12 has heretofore been used and, as the lubricating oil, various kinds of mineral oil and synthetic oil satisfying the required properties described above have been used. However, chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) including Flon 12 are being more rigorously restricted world-wide because they bring environmental pollution such as the rupture of the ozone layer. By this reason, hydrogen-contairiing Flon compounds such as hydrofluoro-carbons (HFC) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC) are attracting attention as the novel kinds of the refrigerant. The hydrogencontaining fluorocarbons, particularly hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) represented by Flon 134a, are preferred as the refrigerant for compression-type refrigerators because they have little possibility of causing the rupture of the ozone layer and can replace Flon 12 with little change of the structure of refrigerators which have heretofore been used.<br>
When a hydrogen-containing Flon compound described above.<br><br>
such as Flon 134a, Flon 32, Flon 125, Flon 22 and the Hke, is adopted as the refrigerant for compression-type refrigerators to replace Flon 12, a lubricating oil having good compatibility with the hydrogen-containing Flon compound, such as Flon 134a, Flon 32, Flon 125, Flon 22 and the like, and good lubricating property satisfying the requirements described above is naturally required. However, because the lubricating oils used in combination with Flon 12 heretofore do not have good compatibility with the hydrogen-containing Flon, such as Flon 134a, Flon 32, Flon 125 and the like, a new lubricating oil suited for these compounds is required. When a new lubricating oil is adopted, it is desired that major change of the structure of the apparatus is not necessary. It is not desirable that the structure of the currently used apparatus must have major changes because of a lubricating oil.<br>
As the lubricating oil having the compatibility with Flon 134a, for example, lubricating oils of polyoxyalkylene glycols have been known. For example, Research Disclosure No. 17463 (October, 1978), the specification of the United States Patent No. 4755316, Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 1989-25C594, Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 1989-259093, Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 1989-259094, Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 1989-271491, Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 1990-43290, Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 1990-84491, Japanese Patent Applications Laid Open No. 1990-132176 to.l32178, Japanese Patent AppUcation Laid Open No. 1990-132179, Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 1990-173195, Japanese Patent Applications Laid Open No. Ib90-180986 to<br><br>
180987, Japanese Patent Applications Laid Open No. 1990-182780 to 182781, Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 1990-242888, Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 1990-258895, Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 1990-269195, Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 1990-272097, Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 1990-305893, Japanese Patent Application Laid Ooen No. 1991-28296, Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 1991-33193, Japanese Patent Applications Laid Open No. 1991-103496 to 103497, Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 1991-50297, Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 1991-52995, Japane Patent Applications Laid Open No. 1991-70794 to 70795, Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 1991-79696, Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 1991-106992, Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 1991-109492, Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 1991-121195, Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 1991-205492, Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 1991-231992, Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 1991-231994, Japanese P tent Application Laid Open No. 1992-15295, Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 1992-39394 and Japanese Patent Applications Laid Open No. 1992-41591 to 41592 disclosed such lubricating oils. However, the lubricating oils of polyoxyalkylene glycols generally have low volume specific resistances and no example satisfying the value of 102 j.cm or more at SOC has been disclosed yet.<br>
As the compound having the compatibility with Flon 134a in addition to the lubricating oils of polyoxyalkylene glycols, lubricating oils of esters were disclosed in British Patent Laid Open No. 2216541, WO No.<br><br>
6979 (1990), Japanese Patent Applications Laid Open No. 1990-276894, Japanese Patent Applications Laid Open No. 1991-128992, Japanese Patent Applications Laid Open No. 1991-88892, Japanese Patent Applications Laid Open No. 1991-179091, Japanese Patent Applications Laid Open No. 1991-252497, Japanese Patent Applications Laid Ope.. No. 1991-275799, Japanese Patent Applications Laid Open No. 1992-4294, Japanese Patent Applications Laid Open No. 1992-20597 and the specification of the United States Patent No. 5021179. However, the lubricating oils of esters do not have sufficient compatibility because the phase separation occurs when.viscosity of the lubriciiLiiig oils is higli at lower temperature even though they show good compatibility at higher temperature.<br>
Thus, it is the real situation at present that a lubricating oil for the compression-type refrigerators having excellent compatibility with Flon 134a, excellent stability and lubricating property and a volume specific resistance at 80Â°C of 102 Q.cm or more has not been discovered yet. The development of such a lubricant is strongly desired.<br>
Polyvinyl ether compounds are important compounds having a wide range of applications, such as solvents, lubricating oils, resins and the like and, as the methods of production of polyvinyl etiier compounds, the methods of polymerizing vinyl ether monomers with a radical, a cation or an irradiation are known ("Gosei Kobunshi III", edited by Shunsuke Murahashi, Minoru Imoto and Hisashi Tani, published by Asakura Shoten). However, these conventional methods have problems that a compound having the desired degree of polymerization is not<br><br>
easily obtained, that the prcrcess is complicated, that control of the reaction is difficult, that a large amount of solvent is required and the like problems and are not always satisfactory. Thus, development of the method of production of polyvinyl ether compound Imving no such problems as described above isistrongly desired.<br>
As the method of producing an ether compound having a wide range of applications as solvents and lubricants from acetal compounds or ketal compounds, for example, a method of using a combination of an acid and an alkali metal hydride, a method of using a silicon reagent and a method of using diborane or the like are known ("Jikken Kagaku Koza", Volume 20, the 4th edition, published by Maruzen).<br>
However, these reactions use stoichiometric amounts of very expensive materials like the alkali metal hydride, diborane and the silicon reagent as the hydrogenating reagent and are not preferable as the method of industrial production.<br>
A method of a combination of an acid catalyst and catalytic hydrogenation is known. W. L. Howard [J. Org. Chem. Volume 26, Page 1026 (1961)] reported the formation of an ether by catalytic hydrocracking of a ketal by using a catalyst in which rhodi\m is supported on aluii.ina in the presence of hydrochloric acid. In the specification of the United States Patent No. 4088700, a method of production of an ether compound by catalytic hydrocracking of 1,3-dioxoranes which are cyclic acetals by using a platinum catalyst or a rhodium catalyst in the presence of a Lewis acid such as boron trifluoride, aluminum trichloride and the like is   shown.     However,  because   these   methods   of productioi;  use<br><br>
hydrochloric acid, boron trifluoride, aluminum trichloride and the like, corrosion of the apparatus ,becomeB the problem when the ordinary apparatus is used and a special treatment is necessary, making the method unfavorable.<br>
As the method without using acids, for example, methods of producing an ether compound by hydrocracking of acetals by a palladium catalyst supported on carbon were proposed in Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 1983-4739 and Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 1983-177929. Though these niethods do not have the problem of corrosion because they do not use acids, conversion of the material acetal is not satisfactory.<br>
Thus, a method of production of the ether compound from an<br>
acetal compound or a ketal compound which has sufficient reaction<br>
activity, shows good selectivity and does not cause corrosion of the<br>
apparatus is not discovered yei and the development of such a method is<br>
strongly desired.	f<br>
On the other hand, for tiie applications as lubricating oils, electric insulating oils and solvents, fluidity is necessary and a polymer liaving a lower degree of polymerization is desired. Concerning generally known polyalkyl vinyl ethers, examples of synthesis of various kinds of alkyl polyvinyl ether are described in "Jikken Kagaku Koza", Volume 18, "Reaction of organic compounds 11(A)", edited by Chemical Society of Japan (published by Maruzen), In the cases of alkyl vinyl ethers having an alkyl group of 3 or less carbon atoms amcng these examples, examples of the lowest molecular weight of a polymer are 2545 for the<br><br>
polymer of methyl vinyl ether, 4000 for the polymer of ethyl vinyl ether, 4830 for the polymer of n-propyl vinyl ether and 4580 for the polymer of isopropyl vinyl ether. A polymer of methyl vinyl ether having the molecular weight of 3000 is described in Macromolecules, Volume 17, Page 2228 (1984) and a poisoner of ethyl vinyl ether having the molecular weight of 2600 is described in Macromolecules, Volume 18, Page 2 (1985). However, the values of molecular weight suggest that these polymers have very low fluidity and are in the condition of semi-solid at tht room temperature.<br>
In the cases of the compounds having an alkyl group of 4 or more carbon atoms, an example in which a dimer was isolated and an example in which a polymer having the molecular weight of 600 was obtained are found. However, polymers of alkyl vinyl ethers having an alkyl group of 4 or more carbon atoms do not satisfy the required property because they are not compatible with the hydrofluorocarbons such as Flon 134a.<br>
As described in the above, a polymer of alkyl vinyl ether having an<br>
alkyl group of 3 or less carbon atoms which has a molecular weirht o<br>
1200 or less has not been known heretofore.	<br>
Ends of these polymers are olefins in the case of the acid catalysts and acetals when an alcohol is present and, when water is present, ends of acetal and ends of aldehyde are also formed. The end of olefm occasionally causes coloring and increase of viscosity in the presence of an acid and the end of aldehyde also occasionally causes coloring. Acetals are decomposed to olefins and alcohols in the presence of an<br><br>
acid. The olefins react with each other to cause coloring and increase of viscosity and, when water is present additionally, aldehydes are formed, also occasionally causing coloring. However, a polyvinyl ether compound which does not contain the structures causing degradation, such as the structures of acetals, aldehydes and olefins, at the ends of the molecule and has an excellent stability has not been reported yet.<br>

acid catalyst or a solid acid catalyst having the hydrogenating ability is utilized.<br>

;he   room   temperature   and   the   pressure   was   decreased   to   the<br>
itmospheric pressure.  The reaction mixture was filtered and water and<br>
,he like were removed from the solution part under the reduced pressure<br>
)y using a rotary evaporator. The yield was 158 g. By this procedure, the<br>
tame ether compound as in Example 37 (2) was obtained from the<br>
naterial acetal and the conversion was 100 %.    The kinematic viscosity<br>
vas 7.06 at 100Â°C and 57.32 at 40Â°C.<br>
example 41<br>
Into a 1 liter autoclave made of SUS-316L, 200 g of the oligomer<br><br>
prepared in Example 37 (1) described above, 10 g of zeolite and 5.0 g of Pd/C (supporting 5 % of Pd, a product of Wako Jun-yaku Co., Ltd.) were charged. Hydrogen was introduced into the autoclave and the pressure of hydrogen was adjusted to 7 kg/cm. After stirring for about 30 seconds, the pressure was released. Hydrogen was introduced into the autoclave again and the pressure of hydrogen was adjusted to 7 kg/cm. After stirring for about 30 seconds, the pressure was released. After repeating this operation once more, the pressure of hydrogen was brought to 7 kg/cm and the temperature was increased to 120Â°C in 30 minutes under stirring. The reaction was conducted at 120Â°C for 7 hours. The reaction proceeded during and after the increase of the temperature and decrease of the pressure was observed. The increase of the pressure by the increase of the temperature and the decrease of the pressure by the reaction were suitably compensated by decreasing or increasing the pressure and the pressure of hydrogen was kept at 7 kg/cm2 during the reaction. After finishing the reaction, the reaction mixture was cooled to the room temperature and the pressure was decreased to the atmospheric pressure. The reaction mixture was filtered and water and the like were removed from the solution part under the reduced pressure by using a rotary evaporator. The yield was 167.2 g. By this procedure, the same ether compound as in Example 37 (2) was obtained from the material acetal and the conversion was 100 %. The kinematic viscosity was 5.28 at 100Â°C and 32.93 at 40Â°C.<br>
Example 42<br><br><br><br>
Example 43<br>
Into a 2 liter autoclave made of SUS-316L, 15 g of Ni-diatomaceous earth and 350 g of hexane were charged. After replacing the atmosphere inside of the autoclave with hydrogen, the pressure of hydrogen was adjusted to 30 kg/cm. The temperature was increased to 150Â°C in 30 minutes under stirring and the activation treatment of the catalyst was conducted for 30 minutes. After cooling the autoclave, 300 g of the oligomer prepared in Example 37 (1) described above and 15 g of zeolite were charged into the autoclave. Hydrogen was introduced into the autoclave and the pressure of hydrogen was adjusted to 30 kg/cm. After stirring for about 30 seconds, the pressure was released. Hydrogen was introduced into the autoclave again and the pressure of hydrogen was adjusted to 30 kg/cm. After stirring for about 30 seconds, the pressure was released. After repeating this operation once more, the pressure of hydrogen was brought to 30 kg/cm and the temperature was increased to 130Â°C in 30 minutes under stirring. The reaction was conducted at 130Â°C for 1 hour. The reaction proceeded during and after the increase of the temperature and decrease of the pressure was observed. The increase of the pressure by the increase of the temperature and the decrease of the pressure by the reaction were suitably compensated by decreasing or increasing the pressure and the pressure of hydrogen was kept at 30 kg/cm during the reaction. After finishing the reaction, the reaction mixture was cooled to the room temperature and the pressure was decreased to the atmospheric pressure. The reaction mixture was filtered and water and the like were removed from the solution part<br><br>
under the reduced pressure by using a rotary evaporator. The yield was 240 g.<br>
The conversion of the material acetal was 100% like in Example 37.   The kinematic viscosity was 5.38 at 100Â°C and 33.12 at 40Â°C.<br>
