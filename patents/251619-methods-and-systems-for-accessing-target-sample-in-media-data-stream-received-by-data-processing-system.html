THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION<br>
AND THE MANNER IN WHICH-IT IS TO BE<br>
PERFORMED.<br><br><br>
  1<br><br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The present disclosure relates generally to data processing, and more<br>
particularly to methods and systems for processing and accessing metadata in<br>
a media file.<br>
Media files, such as MPEG-4 files, comprise media data and metadata of the<br>
media data. The metadata provides data sample information to media<br>
applications for processing media data in the media file. Generally, media<br>
files are defined to be organized with several structural elements. For example,<br>
MPEG-4 files are composed of structural elements call boxes. Each box may<br>
comprise media data, metadata or other sub-boxes. For example, a sample<br>
table box (STBL) records time and file information of media data. According to<br>
the time and file information in the STBL box, applications can obtain the time,<br>
type, data size, and position in the media file and further perform the play-back<br>
or random-seek functions toward the media file, accordingly. The STBL box<br>
also includes several sub-boxes comprising a decoding time to sample box<br>
(STTS) as shown in Fig. 1, a sample size box (STSZ), a sample to chunk box<br>
(STSC) as shown in Fig. 3, a chunk offset box (STCO), a sync sample box<br>
(STSS) as shown in Fig. 2, sample description table (STSD), and others.<br>
The STTS box contains at least one entry for recording the time duration of<br>
samples of media data. Fig. 1 shows a STTS box 100, comprising 5 entries<br>
with total 45 samples in the media data. It should be noted that data in the<br>
STTS box is recorded using the concept of run-duration coding to reduce the<br>
size thereof. That is, the time duration for media sample #1~#6, #7~#20,<br>
#21-#31, #32~#33, and #34~#45 is 66, 67, 63, 64, and 66 time units,<br>
respectively, and the total time duration of the 45 sample of the media data is<br>
2947 time units.<br>
Traditionally, a linear search through these boxes is performed to help locating<br>
a specific sample with a target decoding time. A linear search means that the<br>
time duration of respective samples from the very first media sample is<br>
accumulated until the accumulated time duration equals or exceeds the target<br>
decoding time. For example, to locate a specific sample with a specific<br>
decoding time 2000, a linear search is performed by accumulating the time<br>
2<br><br>
duration of the first thirty samples. Since the total time duration of the first<br>
thirty samples is 1964 (6*66+14*67+10*63=1964) and the total time duration of<br>
the first thirty-one samples is 2027 (6*66+14*67+11*63=2027) which exceeds<br>
the specific decoding time 2000, sample #30 is then located. The linear<br>
search calculation is time-consuming if there is large number of entries in these<br>
boxes.<br>
In addition, the media samples in the media data are grouped into chunks.<br>
The STSC box records the mapping relationship between sample and chunk.<br>
Based on the mapping relationship recorded in the STSC box, one can identify<br>
in which chunk a target sample resides, and further obtain other related data<br>
using the chunk information. Fig. 3 shows a STSC 300, in which the number<br>
of samples in chunk #1, chunk #2-#4, chunk #5~#10, and chunk #11~#19 is 3,<br>
4, 7, and 6, respectively. Similarly, data in the STSC is recorded using the<br>
concept of run-duration coding to reduce the size thereof. To locate a specific<br>
sample, a specific chunk corresponding to the specific sample is sought by<br>
performing a linear search by accumulating the number of samples from the<br>
first chunk. The calculation is time-consuming if the number of entries in the<br>
STSC box is large.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
Data processing methods and systems are provided.<br>
In an embodiment of a data processing method for accessing a target sample<br>
in a media data stream, target sample information corresponding to the target<br>
sample is provided. The media data stream has a plurality of samples and<br>
corresponding sample information recorded in at least one entry, wherein the<br>
sample information for a predetermined number of the entries is calculated and<br>
the calculated result is stored in at least one cache entry. One of the cache<br>
entries is located by comparing the target sample information with the<br>
calculated result of respective cache entries. After locating the cache entries,<br>
the target sample from the entries is located according to the located cache<br>
entry.<br>
An embodiment of a data processing system comprises a media data stream,<br>
at least one cache entry, and a processing unit. The media data stream<br>
3<br><br>
comprises a plurality of samples and corresponding sample information<br>
recorded in at least one entry. The sample information for a predetermined<br>
number of the entries is calculated and the calculated result is stored in the<br>
cache entry. The processing unit receives target sample information<br>
corresponding to a target sample, locates one of the cache entries by<br>
comparing the target sample information with the calculated result of<br>
respective cache entries, and after locating the cache entries, locates the<br>
target sample from the entries according to the located cache entry.<br>
Data processing methods may take the form of program code embodied in a<br>
tangible media. When the program code is loaded into and executed by a<br>
machine, the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the disclosed<br>
method.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION<br>
Data processing methods and systems are provided, in which pre-calculated<br>
cache entry, shared cache pool and incremental processing are employed. In<br>
the following embodiments, the data processing methods and systems are<br>
used to decode MPEG-4 files, which is well-defined in ISO standard and is<br>
however not limited in the present invention. An overview of the MPEG-4 files<br>
4<br><br>
is provided in a standard specification of ISO 14496-12, which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.<br>
Pre-calculated cache entry:<br>
Fig. 4 is a schematic diagram illustrating an embodiment of entries in the STTS<br>
box and its corresponding pre-calculated cache entries. Each cache entry<br>
records the accumulated total time duration of a group of STTS entries. In this<br>
embodiment, each group contains 3 STTS entries. As shown in Fig. 4, the<br>
total time duration of the STTS entries E1, E2 and E3 are recorded by cache<br>
entry CE1, the total time duration of the STTS entries E4, E5 and E6 are<br>
recorded by cache entry CE2, the total time duration of the STTS entries E7,<br>
E8 and E9 are recorded by cache entry CE3, the total time duration of the<br>
STTS entries E10, E11 and E12 are recorded by cache entry CE4, and the total<br>
time duration of the STTS entries E13, E14 and E15 are recorded by cache<br>
entry CE5. For example, if STTS entry E1 records 3 samples and the time<br>
duration of each is 5, STTS entry E2 records 5 samples and the time duration<br>
of each is 10, and STTS entry E3 records 7 samples and the time duration of<br>
each is 8, the cache entry CE1 records the total time duration of 15 samples as<br>
121. The calculation for other cache entries is similar thereto. It should be<br>
noted that the time duration recorded in the cache entries could be calculated<br>
in advance.<br>
To locate a specific decoding time, the total time duration of samples recorded<br>
from the very first cache entry is accumulated until the accumulated total time<br>
duration equals or exceeds the specific target decoding time, such that a cache<br>
entry is located. After a cache entry is located, the STTS entries<br>
corresponding to the located cache entry are further checked using a linear<br>
search as the conventional method, in which the time duration of samples from<br>
the first media sample of the located cache entry is accumulated until the sum<br>
of the accumulated time duration of samples in the located cache entry and the<br>
accumulated total time duration of cache entries prior to the located cache<br>
entry equals or exceeds the target decoding time.<br>
5<br><br>
It is understood that the total time duration recorded in the located cache entry<br>
is less than or equal to the specific decoding time. For example, if the<br>
decoding time is between the accumulated total time duration at cache entries<br>
CE1 and CE2, the cache entry CE1 is first located. Then, a specific media<br>
sample corresponding to the specific decoding time is found according to the<br>
accumulated total time duration of cache entries CE1, and the accumulated<br>
time duration of respective samples in STTS entries E7, E8 and E9.<br>
Accordingly, by separately recording the time duration of a group of box entries<br>
in at least one cache entry, it can reduce the frequencies of accessing media<br>
files since the pre-calculated data stored in the cache entry can be directly<br>
accessed. It is understood that the use of pre-calculated cache entry can be<br>
also applied to STSS and STSC. In STSC, the cache entry records the total<br>
number of samples in the chunks covered by the current and prior cache<br>
entries.	<br>
Shared cache pool:<br>
In some embodiments, the number of corresponding cache entries to each box<br>
might be either fixed or dynamically decided according to each box size.<br>
In some embodiments, the total size of cache memory might be limited and the<br>
allocation of the cache entries for each box can be determined using a shared<br>
cache pool model. In the shared cache pool, the number of cache entries for a<br>
box is determined according to the number of entries in the boxes requiring<br>
cache entries in the order of initialization. For example, to allocate a certain<br>
amount of cache entries to the STTS box, the STSS box and the STSC box, the<br>
system will firstly allocate a first ratio of the cache entries to the STSS box.<br>
The first ratio could be the number of STSS entries divided by the total cache<br>
entry amount. In some embodiments, the number of cache entries allocated<br>
to the STSS box can be further limited to a pre-defined maximum number.<br>
Then, the system will allocate a second ratio of the cache entries to the STSC<br>
box. The second ratio could be the number of STSC entries divided by the<br>
total cache entry amount. In some embodiments, the number of cache entries<br>
allocated to the STSC box can also be further limited to a pre-defined<br>
6<br><br>
maximum number. Finally, the system will allocate the rest of the cache<br>
entries to the STTS box. It should be noted that the order of cache allocation<br>
is not limited in the present invention. Any order of cache allocation should be<br>
covered in the present invention.<br>
Incremental processing:<br>
As mentioned above, with the pre-calculated cache entries, lots of time spent<br>
on redundant computation can be reduced. However, if the boxes (STTS,<br>
STSS and STSC) are very large, the calculation of cache entries will need a<br>
certain amount of time. For example, if complete cache entries for the STTS<br>
box must be prepared before a playback, the accumulated total time duration of<br>
a group of STTS entries for respective cache entries must be calculated. To<br>
reduce the response time caused by calculation of cache entries before<br>
playback, the calculation of cache entries is performed with the concept of<br>
incremental processing. In incremental processing, a part of the cache entries<br>
is calculated before playing back media data, and the rest of the cache entries<br>
are calculated progressively during playback. If the data sought by users is<br>
not found in the currently ready cache entries, the calculation of cache entries<br>
is performed forward until the data is covered by the cache entries.<br>
Figs 5A-5D shows an example of incremental processing. In this example,<br>
the memory space 511 of the memory 510 is allocated to the STSS box for its<br>
corresponding cache entries, the memory space 512 of the memory 510 is<br>
allocated to the STSC box for its corresponding cache entries, and the memory<br>
space 513 of the memory 510 is allocated to the STTS box for its<br>
corresponding cache entries. As shown in Fig. 5A, before playing back media<br>
data (see playback status 500), only a part of the cache entries for respective<br>
boxes is calculated. The rest of the cache entries for respective boxes are<br>
calculated progressively during playback, as shown in Fig. 5B. Since the<br>
calculation is accomplished progressively during playback, each time only a<br>
small part of the cache entries is calculated (as shown in Fig. 5C), no time<br>
delay in playback will be aware by users. If a target decoding time prior to<br>
current decoding time is sought, since the required data can be found in the<br>
7<br><br>
calculated cache entries, no time delay will be aware by users. If a target<br>
decoding time is sought and the required data is not found in the calculated<br>
cache entries, the calculation of cache entries is performed forward until the<br>
data is covered by the cache entries, as shown in Fig. 5D.<br>
Fig. 6 is a flowchart showing an embodiment of a data processing method. In<br>
this embodiment, a STTS box is used as an example, rather a limitation to the<br>
invention. To locate a decoding time received in step S601, in step S602, one<br>
of the cache entries is firstly located, in which the total time duration of samples<br>
recorded from the very first cache entry is accumulated until the accumulated<br>
total time duration accumulated to the located cache entry equals or exceeds<br>
the decoding time. In step S603, after the cache entry is located, a sample<br>
corresponding to the decoding time can be easily found by a linear search.<br>
Here, after locating the cache entry, the method of the present invention only<br>
needs to search through the group correspond ing to the cache entry for the<br>
target sample by accumulating the time durations of respective samples in the<br>
STTS entries until the sum of the accumulated time duration of samples in the<br>
located cache entry and the accumulated total time duration of cache entries<br>
prior to the located cache entry equals or exceeds the target decoding time.<br>
Therefore, total search time can be reduced. It is understood that if the sample<br>
is sought for playback, it is also determined whether the sample can be<br>
randomly accessed. As described, there are random accessible samples and<br>
non-random accessible samples among the media data. A random<br>
accessible sample means the sample can be sought and decoded without<br>
regard to other samples. If the desired sample is not a random accessible<br>
one, a random access point (random accessible sample) closest to (equal to or<br>
less than) the sample is sought from the STSS, and a decoding time of the<br>
random access point is then sought from the STTS box.<br>
Fig. 7 is a flowchart showing another embodiment of a data processing<br>
method. In this embodiment, a STSC box is used as an example, rather a<br>
limitation to the invention. To locate a sample with a sample number received<br>
in step S701, in step S702, one of the cache entries is firstly located, in which<br>
the total number of samples recorded from the very first cache entry is<br>
8<br><br>
accumulated until the total number of samples accumulated to the located<br>
cache entry equals or exceeds the sample number. In step S703, after the<br>
cache entry is located, a chunk number that the sample belonged to is located<br>
by a linear search. Here, after locating the cache entry, the method of the<br>
present invention only needs to search through the group corresponding to the<br>
cache entry for the target chunk number. It is understood that if the sample is<br>
sought for playback, related information of the sample is further retrieved from<br>
a sample description table (STSD) according to a corresponding sample<br>
description index of the located chunk number.<br>
Data processing methods, or certain aspects or portions thereof, may take the<br>
form of program code (i.e., executable instructions) embodied in tangible<br>
media, such as products, floppy diskettes, CD-ROMS, hard drives, or any other<br>
machine-readable storage medium, wherein, when the program code is loaded<br>
into and executed by a machine, such as a computer, the machine thereby<br>
becomes an apparatus for practicing the methods. The methods may also be<br>
embodied in the form of program code transmitted over some transmission<br>
medium, such as electrical wiring or cabling, through fiber optics, or via any<br>
other form of transmission, wherein, when the program code is received and<br>
loaded into and executed by a machine, such as a computer, the machine<br>
becomes an apparatus for practicing the disclosed methods. When<br>
.implemented on a general-purpose processor, the program code combines<br>
with the processor to provide a unique apparatus that operates analogously to<br>
application specific logic circuits.<br>
While the invention has been described by way of example and in terms of<br>
preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited<br>
thereto. Those skilled in this technology can still make various alterations and<br>
modifications without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention.<br>
