				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of Sodium silicate from Kimberhte tailings and more particularly it relates to the recovery and use of active silica content of Kimberhte tailings in a manner that allows the preparation of Sodium silicate FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
Around four million tones of soluble silicates are produced annually all over the world that finds major applications in the detergent, pigment, catalyst and silica gel producing industry These silicates are also used in adhesives, cement &amp; building materials as well as pulp and paper industry Soluble silicates are also used for general purposes cleaning like water cleaning, plant cleaning in brewing, dairying, food processing and metal processing industries In foundry industry, silicates are used as a binder for the production of the sand cores and moulds from which castings can be produced These also find application for binding insulating materials such as vermicuhte, perlite and many minerals and ores, sealing porous surfaces such as asbestos and fibrous materials<br>
Alkali silicates are a family of chemicals with a wide range of physical and chemical properties These are mostly prepared by fusing sodium or potassium carbonate with sand at greater than 1000°C or digesting sand with sodium or potassium hydroxide solution und pressure The characteristics ofalkah silicates permit their use in a vanety of applications such as welding rods, soaps, detergents, hard-surface cleaners, coatting materials, and electronics<br>
Sodium silicate, in particular, is used for the manufacture of specialty inorganic materials namely precipitated silica, silica sol / colloidal silica and silica gel, calcium and aluminium silicates, zinc and titanium silicates, magnesium tnsihcate, zeolites etc Sodium silicate is also used in ore flotation, canal lining and in consolidation of earth<br>
Kimberhte tailing is produced as a huge solid waste during diamond mining In a country like India from its Panna diamond mines, typically around 100 tones of Kimberhte is generated per 10 carat of diamond mined Around 3-4 million tones of Kimberhte is already accumulated dunng previous diamond mining in India With an estimated life of 20 years for the Panna mines, huge quantity of Kimberhte waste is likely to be available<br>
in the country. Considering this problem on the global scale as countries like South Africa and Canada are also involved in diamond mining, the quantity of Kimberlite generated is of a serious concern. Therefore, it is pertinent to look for technical solutions to gainfully utilize Kimberlite accumulated during diamond mining. Typical chemical composition of Kimberlite is as follows:<br>
SiO2 30 - 32%, A12O3 2 - 5%, TiO2 5 - 8%, CaO 8 - 10%, MgO 20 - 24%, Fe2O3 5 - 11%, LOI 13 - 15%<br>
Kimberlite being rich in magnesia and silica, there is an opportunity to develop silica and magnesium based products from this materials. Therefore, efforts were made to prepare value-added product like Sodium silicate after enrichment of silica content followed by chemical treatment. The value-addition of Kimberlite will not only make diamond mining more economical but will make it environment friendly process also.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
US Patent No 2,219,646 (1940) assigned to Beecher and Mich have disclosed a process for the preparation of sodium silicate by dry fusion of silica with sodium hydroxide at temperature below the fusion or melting point of sodium hydroxide and about 2 to 4 % soda ash is added to the reaction mixture The source of silica could be silica sand, quartz, volcanic ash, silica flour etc The drawback of the process is high temperature fusion of silica with sodium hydroxide and thus process becomes energy intensive and uneconomical<br>
US Patent No 2,829,030 (1958) assigned to Habermckel wherein the process for producing alkali metal silicates having SiO2/Na2O mole ratio 2 74 to 3 16 is reported from the mixture of sand and alkali chlondes with about 2 to 4 % other alkali metal salts like sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate and bicarbonate or mixture of them under the action of steam The process involves the sintering step in which mixture of silica and alkali metal chloride is ground and then sintered at 780° C to 840° C and then cooled before steam treatment at 1150° C to 1250° C This process replaces conventionally used alkali carbonates and sulfates with cheaper alkali chlondes However, the process is highly energy intensive as it is earned out at a high reaction temperature of 1150-1250°C for 2-6 hours and involves pretreatment of smtenng of the reaction mixture<br>
US Patent No 2,988,423 (1961) assigned to McDamel has desenbed a process for the preparation of sodium silicate having SiO2/Na2O mole ratio in the range of 1 0 to 2 8 by reacting silica sand and aqueous solution of sodium carbonate at 155°C to 217°C under the pressure of 65 to 300 pound per square inch for about 20 hours or more The drawbacks of the invention are the mole ratio of the sodium silicate prepared is comparatively low, high reaction pressure and temperature and very long reaction time make process uneconomical<br>
US Patent No 3,984,526 (1976) assigned to Haase, et al have disclosed a process for the preparation of alkali metal polysilicate solution having an S1O2 alkali metal oxide mole ratio of 2 5 - 5 5 1 and a silica content of 16 - 23% by weight which compnses contacting a tetraalkoxysilane of the formula Si(OR)4 wherein each R is independently a straight or branched-chain alkyl group of 1 to 3 carbon atoms with an aqueous alkali<br>
metal hydroxide solution at a temperature between room temperature and the boiling point of the reaction mixture and at a temperature up to 100°C, distilling over alcohol formed by the reaction of the silane with the alkali metal hydroxide The drawback of the process is the source of silica is tetraalkoxysilane which makes process uneconomical US Patent No 4,029,736 (1977) assigned to Melkoman, has disclosed a process for the preparation of water glass using perhte as a source of silica by treating the same with an alkaline solution having a concentration of 40-140 g/1 taken in an amount which brings the ratio of the liquid and solid phases to (0 7-1 5) 1 and then separating by filtration the water glass, obtained in the process of heat treatment, from the residue formed The drawback of the process is reaction of the perhte with alkali metal hydroxide at 130° C to 150° C under autogenous pressure<br>
US Patent 4,336,235 (1982) assigned to Deabnges Jean comprises a process for the manufacture of sodium silicate solution in a continuous manner from a silicon dioxide-contaimng material This process includes continuous addition of a stream of said silicon dioxide-containing material and sodium hydroxide-sodium carbonate solution to a reaction zone at a temperature 225-245°C and pressure 27-32 bar and for a time sufficient to form a sodium silicate solution, and recovering said sodium silicate solution from the reaction zone In this process the stream of NaOH-Na2CO3 is pre-heated at temperature 250-280°C in a nickel plated heat exchanger This requires high cost equipment and operating condition shows that utility cost required is comparatively high which increases the production cost<br>
US Patent No 4,520,001 (1985) assigned to Metzger, et al have disclosed a process for the preparation of clear solution of alkali metal silicate having an SiCValkah metal oxide weight ratio of 2 5 or less which comprises passing an aqueous solution of an alkali metal hydroxide through a bed of crystallized silica having an average particle size of between about 0 1 mm and 2 mm formed in the bottom of a vertical tubular reactor without mechanical agitation, said silica and alkali metal hydroxide being fed from the top of the reactor, and recovering the resulting clear solution of alkali metal silicate from the bottom of the reactor The reaction temperature was kept between 150°C and 240°C The drawback of the process is the SiCValkah metal oxide weight ratio is 2 5 or less High<br>
SiCValkah ratio silicate can not be obtained and minimum 150°C reaction temperature is required<br>
US Patent No 4,676,953 (1987) assigned to Jeromin, et al have described a process for continuous production of sodium silicate having mole ratio SiO2/Na2O 1-2 8 1 by fusing sand in aqueous sodium hydroxide solution at 150-300°C and 5-40 bar pressure The drawback of the process is high reaction temperature under high pressure which makes process uneconomical<br>
US Patent No 4,770,866 (1988) assigned to Chnstophhemk, et al have disclosed the process of producing sodium silicate by melting quartz sand and soda together at 1,400°C to 1,500°C in a suitable furnace with evolution of CO2 The melt that solidifies upon coolmg in the form of a glass lump is then dissolved in water in another process step earned out under pressure at elevated temperature The solution thus obtained is optionally filtered, depending upon the quality requirements However, this process consumes very high amount of energy because of very high process temperature US Patent No 5,000,933 (1991) assigned to Novotny, et al has disclosed a process for the preparation of sodium silicate having high Si02/Na20 molar ratio by reaction of a silicon dioxide source with aqueous sodium hydroxide solutions, or with aqueous sodium silicate solution using silicon dioxide source that contains sufficient fraction of enstobahte phase or by conditioning other crystalline forms or by conditioning other crystalline forms of silicon dioxide by heating at or above 1100° C, but below the melting point of silica, before the hydrothermal treatment The reaction is earned out in a closed pressure reactor at temperatures of 150° C to 300° C and under saturated steam pressures corresponding to those temperatures The drawback of this process is requirement of sufficient amount of enstobahte phase of S1O2 in the silica source and if not the silica source is required to be treated at very high temperature before hydrothermal reaction with sodium hydroxide solution Another drawback of the process is the hydrothermal reaction is earned out in the range of 150° C to 300° C under autogenous pressure<br>
According to the above prior art, sodium silicate is prepared using quartz sand, enstobahte, perhte etc and sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide Process known in the prior art for the preparation of sodium silicates are either energy intensive or operating conditions are such that utility cost is very high    Nothing is reported in<br>
published or patented literature wherein Kimberlite tailing has been used as a source of silica for the preparation of sodium silicate and other value added silica based products<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A known weight of Kimberlite tailing is added to 18% wt /Vol of hydrochloric acid previously taken in a glass round bottom flask, keeping solid to liquid ratio 1 4 with continuous stirring at boiling temperature under refluxing conditions After refluxing for 3 to 5 hours, the slurry is filtered and wet cake is washed with tap water till free from acid For the preparation of sodium silicate, acid treated Kimberlite tailing thus obtained was digested with 8 to 10 weight percent NaOH solution keeping solid to liquid ratio as 1 4 The required quantity of sodium hydroxide is dissolved in requisite volume of water previously taken in a stainless steel jacketed reactor To this alkali solution, required weight of acid treated Kimberlite was added slowly under stirring in order to prepare homogenous slurry Reaction temperature was achieved by means of passing steam through the jacket of the reactor After attaining the temperature, the digestion was continued for a specific time under constant stirring   After completion of the reaction,<br>
slurry was filtered and residue was washed with tap water to recover silica and alkali. Filtrate and wash water were analyzed for its SiO2 and Na2O content.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
1.     Accordingly, the present invention provides A process for the preparation   of sodium<br>
silicate from Kimberlite tailings which comprises:<br>
i)	treating   Kimberlite tailings with 2 to 15 % mineral acid for a time duration<br>
between 3-5 h at   a temperature ranging between 95-100°C   to obtain silica<br>
enriched material as a solid, ii)        digesting silica enriched solid with alkali solution of strength ranging between 8<br>
to 10 % in a closed system at 95-190°C or in open system at boiling temperature<br>
for a time duration of 3-4 h to obtain sodium silicate with SiO2/Na2O mole ratio<br>
1.81 to 3.36.<br>
The Raw Kimberlite typically contains about 32-35% silica. In order to recover silica and to convert this silica into value added product, it is essential to increase the silica content of the Kimberlite tailings by means of its upgradation. Enrichment of silica in the Kimberlite is necessary for its effective use as source of silica to produce sodium silicate. Kimberlite tailing was treated with hydrochloric acid at boiling temperature under refluxing conditions and continuous stirring to remove the acid soluble impurities. The silica content in the acid treated Kimberlite tailing increases up to 72-78%. Kimberlite tailing enriched in silica is used for the preparation of storage stable sodium silicate.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, Kimberlite tailing is ground using Pin mill and passed through 60 mesh sieve.<br>
In an another embodiment of the present invention, the -60 mesh fraction of Kimberhte<br>
tailing is treated with mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid at boiling temperature under<br>
refluxing conditions with continuous stirring to remove the acid soluble impurities<br>
present in the Kimberhte tailing as a filtrate<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the acid treated Kimberhte tailing<br>
which is rich in silica content is digested with an alkali such as sodium hydroxide<br>
solution at 105°C under stirring for a fixed penod of 3 to 5 h<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the alkali digested Kimberhte tailing<br>
is filtered using vacuum filtration system<br>
In yet another embodiment, 25% loss of solid was observed dunng the acid treatment of<br>
the Kimberhte tailing as soluble metallic salts in the filtrate which can be further used for<br>
obtaining value added products like Mg (OH) 2, MgO and Fe2O3<br>
In yet another embodiment, 75-85 % silica recovery was obtained from the acid treated<br>
Kimberhte tailing at the boiling temperature<br>
In yet another embodiment, total reduction of solids was found to be 82-87%, which<br>
could remarkably reduce the quantity of solid waste generated dunng diamond mining<br>
Moreover, Kimberhte tailing - the solid waste generated dunng diamond mining - is<br>
converted to silica rich raw matenal for producing sodium silicate<br>
The digestion of acid treated-sihca nch Kimberhte with sodium hydroxide solution at<br>
relatively  moderate  temperature   and  atmosphenc  pressure   gives   sodium   silicate<br>
essentially because the silica present in Kimberhte is an active silica and not m highly<br>

Example 9<br>
Sodium silicate was prepared following the procedure as described in Example-8 is having a dark brownish color probably due to presence of some organic compounds This can be used as such for the preparation of precipitated silica and Zeohte-A However, to improve the quality and color of sodium silicate, decolounzation of sodium silicate was done using activated carbon as decolorizing agent 1 kg of sodium silicate was taken in the stainless steel reactor and it was heated to 75-80°C for 2 h after adding 3-4 % by wt of commercially available activated charcoal under continuous stirring and filtered After the carbon treatment sodium silicate obtained was colorless<br>
The process of prepanng sodium silicate in the present invention is novel in the sense that it makes use of the raw material considered to be solid waste and has not been reported to be used for the said process before so far From technical view point, the process is novel as it involves relatively low temperature (95-105°C) and atmospheric pressure conditions for the preparation of sodium silicate Quartz or silica sand used in conventional processes for the production of sodium silicate requires high temperature (~1100°C) reaction with sodium carbonate as quartz is crystalline matenal and thermodynamically stable form of S1O2 However, Kimberhte is having serpentine mineral which after acid treatment converted to silica in amorphous form and is comparatively active and a better starting matenal for producing sodium silicate The process developed is useful for the value addition of the waste matenal produced dunng diamond mining This will make diamond mining both economically attractive as well as eco-fhendly Furthermore, this will lessen the requirement of naturally occurring good quality sand used for producing sodium silicate and thus contribute towards preserving the ecological balance.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
