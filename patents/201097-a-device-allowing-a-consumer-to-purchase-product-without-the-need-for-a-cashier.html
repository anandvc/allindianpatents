AJ'PARATUS AND METHOD FOR PROVIDING POINT OF PURCHASE<br>
PRODUCTS<br>
PRIORTTY CLAIM<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/2(il ,512. filed January J 2.2001.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Automated pvadiasing machines are becoming more and more prolific. Gomumers have come to rely on the convenience and ^ed of automated tello^ macliines ("ATM's^ fm* banldng. .Eqadiy tn^)Oitant, consumeis have come to tnist the secoiity of dectronic foods transfers. This s{Jeed, convenience and goodwill are begbmsng tto be implemented in automated purchasing macbines^ Not surprisingly, gas stations^ gioccry stores^ ^t food rci^tauraats, movie theateirs, aizports as well as other retail outlets have adde<l automated purchasizig machines to tbeir standard modes of contlucting bmsiness. given their advantages and as people become more accustomed fliem atitomated purchasmg macbiines are likely continue proliferate.></l>
There are a number of advantages inherent in automated purchasing machines. Fiisi:, automated maclnnes arc convenient and reduce waiting time. For instance^ the automated fuel pump enables the consumer to fill the vehicle and complete the tran:;action \vithont having to leave the area around the vdiicle. Second, automated machines o:EFcr additional payment options. For instance* many grocery store checkouts have card readers that ensible the consumer to pay for groceries fiom a bank account or lay credit Third, the automated machines :reduce labor. ATM*s, for instance, allow banks to reduce die number of live telleis. Fourth, automated machines increase throughput. Automated fiiel pumps, for example, reduce the am(»unt of uile time that cars spend next to the pump.<br>
A new entry into the world of automated purchasing machines is the self-scaiming checkout, which has b bag and pay for items<br><br>
witti little or no assistance from store pessoonel A consumer entets a groceiy store<br>
and selects items for puFdiase in the conventional manner. Instead of sq»pioaching a<br>
standard checkoiit manned By a cashier, the consumer ^qpffoaches a bank of antomated<br>
$elf'£canningcliedcoiits, wherein a single caduerova:seesfteoperati	*<br>
machines* Ccaisumers scan their own items and pay for die items by entenng a check, czedit card^ ddrit card or ca^ into the machine.<br>
One problem associated with autraiated purchasing madnnes is 4tat Ibffy can negatively impact point of sale purchases. For example, before die automated fuel pnin|&gt;, the cfxasomer had to ^ter a cmvenience^oie or a sl;ore associated with die gas stadcm. Aldiou^ an inconvenience to the consumer, the mandatoiy visit to the store for payment (the old point of purdhase) encouraged the impulse purchase of confectionery items, such as gum, candy, soft drinks, etc., and non-consum^le items, such as magames and newq&gt;qieis. Tbe automated fiiel pump has moved the point of purchase to £he filling station, wheie point of purchase products are not displayed or adv
In grocery stores and supermarkets, the self-scannine checkout also stands to reduce point of purchase sales, for a couple of reasons. First, the consumer is precccupied with scannii^ products and does not have as much fiee time to peruse and selert a point of purchase product Second, one primaiy advantage that self-scanning diec:kouts provide to ttie grocery store or supennarket is reduced floor ^ace. For exan^le, four sdf-scanning checkouts require approximaitely seventy-five percent .of the space that four standard chedcouts require. Rack ^ace normally associated with standard checkouts, and which displays point of purchase pmdxuits, is likewise reduced. Sdf-scanmng dieckouts stand to reduce the bdght, width and number of racls at groceiy and supermarket checkout lines. Less rack ^ace necessarily dictates less exposure for die point of pmdiase products.<br>
A need generally exists for selleis of point of purchase products to capitalize on the growiQg proliferation of automated purchasing devices. As the point of purchase in a variety of retail areas increasingly moves away 6om a checkout counter to an automated purchasing machine, ^ need exists to provide an apparatus and method of dis]3iaying and supplying point of purchase products at the new point of purchase^<br><br>
In particular^ a need exists to pityvide m vppmtbi&amp; and metfiod for dsplaying and ][&gt;iovidmg point of pijzchase products in combination with seif-scanniiig checkouts at grocery stores and supehnaiketfi.<br>

Current self-sc;mning checkouts stand to reduce point of purchase Siiles because; (i) the consumer is preoccupied with scanning products and does not have as much free time to peruse and select a point of purchase product; (ii) the amount of floor space available for standard point of purchase racks is reduced; and (iii) the architecture of current popular self-scanning checkouts requires tlaat the height of the staa^idard racks be reduced.<br>
With current self-scanning checkouts, the consumer actively accumulates a cost for items brought to the point of purchase. That is, instead of standing in line and lookuig at a rack full of point of purchase products while a cashier enters the cost of fie consumer's items, the consumer at the self-scaxining checkout pulls items out of a shoppijig cart or other storage area, individually scims each item, checks a video raonitor.lo ensure that the right items and the right prices are being accumulated, bags<br><br>
iie scanned items and pays for fte items* bi shoit the consumer has a lot less time to ooi: at cuntntly dsplayed point of purchase products and, equally imprntantly, may pt remember to do so.<br>
The available qpace problem for point of pmdiasie products at cmreot self* scaiming dieckouts is tvrofold. First, thore is less available ^ace. Second, &amp;e space hat is available is not located ^eciScally at Hie point of the customer's focus. Thai is, [he racks m^ist be placed on dfher side of» or otherwise separately fiom, the omrent scanner, the cunent monitor, the current payment acceptor and Ae current bagging atesi, ie^ away from the consumer's focus.<br>
The reduced rack q&gt;ace mems that fiiere will be a hij^er level of competition betveen sui:^Uers of point of purchase products. RetaQeis ^t use self-scanning dieckouts are carefiilly selecting products for the available rack space, which is now at an i^en higher premium. It is Ukety that high^velocity, Mgh-mar^ products will take the Eon's share of available spzc^ because retailers cannot afford to risk stocking a los^a* or even a mid-level performer. The result has bee^ and will continue to be a decline in ms9/ product offerings.<br>
Both the product supplier and the retailer will suffer from reduced sales of point of purchase products. Brand recognitioa will begin to erode and the retailer will loss the additional sale. Retailets are thus currently forced to dedde between providing the efficiency associated with sclf-scanmng chedkouts or holding on to the point of pun:hase sale.<br>
Quick service lestaurants ("QSR*s") provide a similar but slightly diffeiient chsitlengc. QSR*s alsK) have limited floor space for i&gt;oint of purchase products. Counter space at the QSR is limited and reqpiires free access to process a fast food transaction. The floor space in front of the counter needs to be open for lines to form and for tlie consumer to choose food items. Placing a standard point of purchase product rack in the middle of a fast food floor and requiong the consumer to bring a point of purchase product to the counter simply does not integrate well with an over th^ counter fast food transaction.<br>
Maiuy QSR's are also expeiiencing quality labor shortages. QSR's tend to have hi{;h employee turnover and training costs. Pioduct sbiinkage is also an issue with QSR's.    QSR^s are therefore looking at a number of t<xhnologies to alleviate their></xhnologies><br>
tedted space and labor i«aes, mcteasc cpaational efiGdeodes and niitigke piodact tamkaga One low^ solution is a point of sale Idosfc that elinmiates the «„„r«ntioaaI cadi register. Another solution is a -speedpass^ paymeut system in whidia^wand-ispiovidedtotheconsnmer. Ite wand operates on a ladio frequency C^T^ to send fest food transaction infomation to a cKdit/d«*itcaid account TTie sp.«dpass system is conqwct, requires fittle counter spac« and no floor space ^ op
tncnsaction.<br>
The chaflenge that QSR's pnssent to point of purchase product suppliers is to pK,vide a solution that wfc wth the conventional, e,g., cash register, system and any<br>
alt-smative primary fest food item purchasing system. The point ofpunihase system, in or/event, preferably: 0) is convenient for flie consumer and the fist food employee to nas (iO does not increase or significantly increase labor costs; (in) requires titUe colter sp^ and litUe or no floor q&gt;ac^ Ov) xeduces piodurt shrinkage; (y) integrates with any primary fast food item purchasing system; and (vi) assists in inventory managemcDt by providing pomt of purchase mventory daU to the system.<br>
Referring now to the dravmgs and in particular to Figure 1. an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. As illustiated, a self-scanning purchasing device 10 is provided Typical self-scaimmg checkouts are kioown and are available, for exsmiple. from NCR Corp. and Optimal Robotics Coq&gt;. The self-scamung checkout 10 includes a «»ntiDllcr 12. The controller 12 includes a pnjcessor 14, a memory device 16 and a power supply 18. The processor 14 m one embodiment is a Pentium^* pK«essar, which runs Windows NT™ software. The memory device 16 runs a program that interfoces peripheral devices connected to the controller 12 with human<br>
operatiort<br>
The controUter 12 includes an input/output ri/01 card or module 20 to which<br>
a plurality of wires 22 (e.g., in the form of a ribbon cable or other wire bunching<br>
technique) connect The wires 22 run to various peripheral devices. The peripheral<br>
devices typicaUy include a credit/debit card reader 24. a <jash dispenser a scanning></jash>
device 28. and a display device" having an associated toudi screen mterface Oottch<br>
scisen display 30"). In addition, ES-232 or RS^85 cables may tun from the controller<br>
12 to these devices, in the event that they have their own processing capability. The<br><br>
scaDiung device 28 in an embodiment m^ also be ads^ted to opticaOiy couple to the conttoUer 12. Tbe controller 12 also inclades a video graphics card or module (not illustrated) and may also include a sound caid.<br>
The ocdit/debit card reader 24 enahles a consumer to sdect to pay by credit card or debit card. Tlic card reader 24 includes an insert slot 32 a card reader display 34 and a plurulity of numerical input buttons 36. I^ after inserting a card into the slot 32, the reader 24 cannot read the card nmnber, &amp;e consumer can key in the card nmnl&gt;er using the nuznciicai input buttons 36*<br>
Eidiier the toudi sneen displiiy 30 or tbe numerical ix^ut buttons 36 may be ^dap^ioA to allow the consumer to isnter an amount of money. The self^scanning diedcout 10 ^tvill in turn dispense the amount of money from the cash dispenser 26* Tbe i:ash di^enser 26 includes one or more diq»ensing slots 38 fiiat dispense the cash and t receipt for the transaction.<br>
The s their prices, and a total price, i.e., a virtual receipt<br>
The sel&amp;scamung checkout 10 in an embodiment employs a video camera (not illustiated) to identify produce and other non-bar coded items 42. Once the consumer scan
 <br>
The illustrated sdf-scanning chedcOTit 10 of &amp;e present inventioa iocludes a point of puiKihase device 50, preferably having a stock of piodiict 52 and a dispenser 54. As used herein the lettn "point of purchase** refers to a location wh«e a consnma: payj! for product or otherwise diecks out of a store or other retail mvironment A section 55 of the fiont pand of the self-scanmng cbexkmt 10 has been cutaway to fllustiate Ihat in an esnbodimtiiit, the automated checkout 10 houses the point of pintliase device SO. In 
In the illustrated embodiment, the stock of product 52 piovides a choice of four pioctucts A to D. The stock may obviously mclude my number of different pomt of pmt:hase products 52 including a single product 52. Ihe p<iint of purchase products can be any mufonn distribution or mix fiont-end distributed at near a checkout lim ca register point kiosk speedpass station touch screen ii device other type vending such as an automated movie airline tickst machine. exan purdiase include confectionery ch gum candy magazines toiletries lazcrs small dssue packets batteries dgarette lighters key chains imting tnstiiiments film disposable cameras video tapes digital disks toys> etc.<br>
The present invention solves a number of problems facing suppliers of these typeis of p;ro<:iucts. first in retail outlets products are typically displayed according to a set planagram. the planagrams careliilly constmcticd attempt di an aesoietigally pleasing and organized manner. where point of purchase sire concerned take on even more important role because cqummer is distracted by other items. accordingly certain product siqtj may be terrqx>rar]]y or pennanently locked out of the fiont-end market becjmse there is cunently no place or there never will be a place in ifae ptanagram for the supplier's products. Since ttte point of purchase products 52 of the present invcaition asre di^ensed from a device and are advertised, in one preferred emt»odim(3it, on a dynamic display, there is no need for a planagiam. Consequently, the present invention provides a more flexible front-end market<br><br>
Second, smaDer sopplieis inay M victim to "slotting,** which effectively aBo^vs the larger a^Uere to constinie the limited point of puichase space. Withom the need to satisfy a planagrtm, smaller si^iieis can purchase available space or slots intcimittently. As described in more detafl below, the siitppHeis may also purchase inteimediate advertismg slots. Tlie retail ouflet can establish a system whereby suppliets of faster selling products pay less for one or more of the available slots. A small supplier with a fest moving product therefore has an inroad into the competitive<br>
ffonit-cnd madcet<br>
The retail outlet, e,g., grocery store or supeimaiket can also wodc widi the-largcsr si^Usrs to optimize the 1fan)Uglq)ut of the presait invention. For instance, a particular large sillier may pay a premium to own or maintain a long-term lease on, c,g^ tiiirty percent of the available iiont-end slots or qjace, Ihe supplier is obligated and also desires to maximize the profitability and thiougl^ut of this thirty percent Accordingly, the retail outlet lets the suf^lier manage its tfiirty percent and concentrates on optimizing the profitability and throui^ut of the remaining sevcaoty percent by i^lotting <iuick selling and profitable point of purchase products obviously the percentages may vj from this example retail outlet obtain rnoie than one owner or major leasdioldcr></iuick>
When the consumer desires to purchase one or more of the point of purchase pioiiucts 52. the self'Scanning che^^kout 10 dispenses the one or more products 52 through an npenmg 56 defined by a panel of the automated checkout 10. The opening 56 may in turn be juxtaposed above or near a product dispensing tray (Figure 9). The opening 56 $iod tray in an embodiniient also serve as the oipemng and tray of the coin change dispenser (Figm-e 9). To direct the product 52 fiom the stocking point to the opening 56 or tray, the self-scanning checkout 10 provides one or more ramps or slides 58, Although the ramp or slide 58 is illustrated here as being completely housed wittin the device 10, a portion of or all of the ramp or slide 58 may be disposed on the exterior of tlite self-scannmg checkout 10. The ramp cr slide 58 may also include one or more conveying sections, such as a belt tensioned betweisn rollers (Figure 9).<br>
In Fi^gure 1, the opening 56 dispenses one or more products 52 directly into one of tlie bags 44 of items 42 brought to the point of pxtrchase. In another embodiment, the product 52 may be dispensed from any point on any exposed surface of the self-<br><br>
scacining dieckout 10. For instancy a giocety store or supeimaifcet may place ttie opaUBg 56 (and possibly a iray) near the bill acceptor OT cads out dispenser 26, near the ciedit/ddiit card reader 24, near the tbi»:b scaneen display 30 or near the scanner 28. Placing the dispenser near the payment devices, ie^ the bill acceptor or ttie credit/debit cardi reader 24 enables die consumer to retrieve a di^fiensed product 52 when paying for the items 42 and tbe piodnct 52. Placing Ae d)^&gt;easa' near the touch screen di^lay 30 tmables the consumer to retrieve a dispeaseti prodnct 52 directly after choi:&gt;sing to purchase the dispensed product 52, Placing the dispenser near fi)e scanner 28 isnables the consumer to retrieve a dispensed product 52 while handling flie o&amp;er items 42 brought to the point of purchase.<br>
As illustrated, above or ;ie:u^ the opening 56, the self-scanning checkout 10 pio^Tides advertising or infonnatioa about the different products 52, illustrated here on tiie cutaw^ secdon 55. The advertisement informs the consumer to use the toudi screen display 30 to automatically purchase one or more of &amp;e pioducis A ftroug^ P. The advexti&amp;ement also points the consumer to whete the automated checkout 10 will di^^eose the product, i.e*, from the opemng S6.<br>
The dedicated advertising on the section 55 illusftrates one embbdiment for advertising different point of pim^hase piodncts 52. Jn another embodiment, die advertising on the section 55 may be erasable or otherwise changeable to allow store curators or product distributors to load diSecent products into the point of purchase device 50 and advertise such difiereist products. In anGnther embodiment, the touch scn«n display 30, or a different dynamic video display in communication with the contzoUer 12, advertises the products A to D and may be ad^ted to delete or add one or inoie point of purchase producits 52. In a fixrtfaer embodiment, and in particular where the stock includes many different products 52^ tlie dynamic display may be adapted to scroll tfarougji the different products and display one or more but not all at once. A static or dynamic advertisement display may be mounted m various places on or near the point of piirchasef such as on top of die self-scanning checkout 10 or in &amp;X)i2t of the automated checkout 10 (i.e^ facing the consumer as the consumer approaches the cbeckont 10 from the grocery Isles).<br>
The touch screen display 30, as illustrated, curreoitly provides a message 60, a plurality of simulated buttons 62 0&gt;ne for each product A tfaxough D) and tfie running<br><br>
list ^i of puiG^iased items 42 and diq&gt;ensed products 52. The message 60 infonns tfae consumer of Ifae current total, and that the consumer may at any time diiring the txansiction pmdiase one of the products A to D by selecting one of the buttons 62, In the illustrated embodiment, the touch screen display 30 provides a unique button 62 for cich point of purchase product A to D. In another embodiment, the touch screen may be ad^ted to provide a toggle or •*ncxt" button (not Ithistrated^* wherein the di^lsy 30 rei::alls and displays a m^ point of purchase product 52 each time the ctmsimier presses fht next button, ki this embodiment, the toudi screen display would also provide a select or '"purchase"' button, which would allow the consumer to sequimtially purchase one or more dieqplayed point of purchase products 52.<br>
The running list 64 of the display 30 illustrates that fbe consumer has purcliased a isumber of items 42^ which fbe consumer has selected elsewhere within the siipermadret or convenience store and has transported to the self-scanning checkout 10, The list 64 iilustiates that the coBsumer has selected, trsmspoited and self^scanned cereal, soi^. celery, cake mix and flour* The running list 64. also allnstrates that tfae consimier hais made a point of sale purchase^ namely^* fbe consumer has purchased gum, which is one of the products A tturough D. The consumer's current total of SI2.IX) illusttated by the message 60 includes the pirxce of the point of purchase piodjct 52, i^e., fifty cents. In one prefened embodiment, the present invention combines the cost of items 42 biougbt to the point of pttrchase and fhe products 52 purdiased thi&gt;.Teafter. In this way, Aie consumer pays cash and receives change once, writers one chtxk*or swipes a credit or debit card one time. The seif-scanmng checkout 10 tti^efoie siupplies and the consuniier receives only one receipt<br>
In thi;s iDusirated embodiment, tfae consumer can select flie same button 62 and puicliase the same product 52 as many tim^ as the consumer desires. The consumer can select as many difTerent buttons 62 and purchase as many diffeient products 52 (and as many difTerent types of pro<luots as the consuzaer desires. each time consumer presses a button dispenser dispenses single product in an alternative embodiment touch screen display pioviides simulated num keyjiad and prompts to enter quantity. if enters quantity greater than one ihe multitude of products at onc it siiould be that any simulatt input devices described></luots><br>
berem, sacb las the buttons 62» the next aad purchase buttons described above and the simulated keypad* may altematiyely be provided as electroniechaiiical input devices mounted to the panel of the automated checkout 10 and hard wiied as discrete hiputs into the I/O card or module 20* a$ is well known by those of skill ki the art<br>
Referring now to Figiire 2» a second embodiinent of ^ present invention provides a stand-alone point of putdiase device 50, wtiich is housed within a body 66 that is separate fiom an automated purcha^g device 70. For pinposes of the present invention^ the automated purchasiiig device 70 is any device that accumulates a cost of iteuis or accepts payment for items. In an embodiment,, the automated purchasing device 70 is the self-scanning checkout 10 described in Figure 1. The automated purchasing device 70 in another embodiment is any sumdaxd checkout device manned by«: store operator. That is, the automated purchasing device 70 may be used m an employee operated purchasing line for any type of retail store, e*g., grocery stoie, hst fooci store^ convenience stoie, drug store, hardware store^ clothing store, supexstore, etc., where the employee scans items or where (he operator scans items using a scanner 40 cr inputs selections into a cash roister 72, point of purchase Idosk or touch screen mpif device. The automated purchasing device 70 alsc^ includes credit/debit cazd readers and bin acceptors. The automated purchasing dei/ice 70 finthcr includes any type of de^nce, such as the ^^•^pass, that bypasses the store operator and automaticaUy sends a cost for one or items to a credit or ddbit account<br>
The iStand-alone point of sale device 50 preferably inomits to or near the aotcmated porchasing device 70 so that the device 50 is at the point of purchase. The mitcmated purchasing device 70 iaciudes Ihe controller 12 having a |»ocessor 14» meiaory de^^ce 16, power supply 18 and I/O card or module 20^ Ibe automated pun:basing device 70 may also include any other feature and a|)paratus described above in connection with Figure U except that the point of sale device SO is discrete.<br>
The &gt;c:ontrDller 12 electrically communicates ^ith ithe scanner 28 via wires 22 and'or alternatively optically connects or connects by an RS-232 or RS-485 cable to the scanncsr 28. The controUer 12 alternatively communicates with the scaimer 28 via a nidio fi-eciuency (TIF*) signal, microwave signal, the Internet or via any other suitable communication link. When the automated purchasing device 70 is a self-scaiming checkout 10 (Figure 1), the consumer retrieves an item 42 £rom one of the<br><br>
ston: is]es» brings the item to the scaiimisr 28 and scans t^<br>
transparent cover 40. When the automated purchasing device 70 is an operator controlled dseckout, the consumer retrievies an item 42 fix)m one of the store isles, brini^ the item to tiie scanner 28, wherem the store operator scans the item by passing it across the transparent cover 40. In cither case, &amp;e scanoer 28 in one embodiment is a sfand^cne scann^ 28, as illustrated, and in another embodiment, the scanner 40 is a hand-held scanner that ci&amp;er ibe consumer or the operator holds so that a smaller tranf^parent cover 40 of the hand«beld scanner passes across the barcode of the purchasable item 42*<br>
The controller 12 elediically communicates with the cash register 72 via ^wes 22 imd/or via an RS*232 or RS*485 connection. The controller 12 alternatively communicates with the cash register 72 via an RF signal, microwave signal, the Internet <nr nia any odier suitable commum liok. the contrdlier in an embodiment only couples to sccmner another connects i:ash register and a fiirfher both scanner .></nr>
When the contioller.12 cott{3lcs to tfae^casfa register 72, a store operator mans the cash regist^ 72. In certain retail operations, such as grocery stores, conveuience stons, drug stores, hardware stores, clothing stores, superstores, the consumer retrieves an item 42, such as a box of food. Scorn one of the store isles, and brings the itemt to the operator, who enters the item or price of the item into the cash register 72, in Gther retml operations, such as Hast food restaurants or at wiQ-call windows, the coDSrumer sqpproacbes the operator and orders purchasable items 42, such as hamburger and files, wherein the operator enters the item or price of the item into the cash register 72.<br>
The controller 12 also communicates with one of the touch screen displays 30a or 30b. Her^, the displays 30a and 30b are ^own as being mounted on ^e exterior of the automated purchasing device 70. Although two touch screen displays are illo£trated, only one is necessary as described above. The display 30a is ad^ted for when the consumer scans the items 42, i.e., at a self-scanising checkout (Figure 1). Hers, the disrplay 30a provides a suitable message 74a Ithat prompts the consumer, after the consumer has scanned all the purchasable items 42, whether the consumer wishes<br><br>
to purchase cme of the t&gt;oint of pucchase products 52, namely, products A to D. ine di^liy 30a also provides simulated buttons 62. In Figure 1, the toudi screen displs^ 30 ectabled the cmsumer at any point during the self-scanning process to select one or more of the buttons 62. The toudt sciem displays may he ad^ted to prompt the consume to sdect a pimluct 32 to hmnediately dispense before daring or, as here^ after the scanning sequence.<br>
The display 30a may have any suitable message that pfompts the consumer to purdiase a dispensable product 52. For instance, the display 30a may he ad^ted to shov^' the consumer the current total plus the cost for a dispensed product 52. For example, the diq;&gt;lay 30a mi^t rea<l total comes to a pack of gum would add forty cents including tax. press one below dispense. the display could also disclose new e padc wqiilid bring inchiding bebw any die messages or prompts disclosed hisrein may be visual auclio audiovisual.></l>
hi any of the embodiments described herein, the memory 16 of the controller 12 may be ads^ted to store a con^uter program that enables^ the prompt to be a **smart prompt** That is^ the software is configured to: (i) select a prompt based on one or mors items 42 ftat the consumer hai; selected and transported to the point of purchase; (li) select a prompt based on a customer profile obtained J&amp;om the customer's grocery ston^ card or from data collected-by die controller, or (iii) select a prorr^t based on an algorithm that combines (i) and (it). The processor 14 of the controller 12 operates witti the computer progr^on stored in ibe memory 16 to display a smart prompt on the 4£splay30aor30b.<br>
When the smart prompt is based on the items 42 that the consumer has selected and transported to the point of purchase, the program in an embodiment looks for patterns or signals provided by the items 42* For instance, if the consumer collects and brings one or more items 42 to the point of purchase that are sugar fiiee, fat free, low fat, have sugar substimtes, etc., the smart prompt may include a sugar fiee item, such as sugar firee gmn. In another example, if a number of desert-type items are brought to the point of purchase, the smart prompt may include candy&gt; such as a candy bar. If the consumer h;cis pulled a magazine iiom the store rack^ the smart prompt may include<br><br>
aaotliier pedodical, CN&gt;viously; tiiose of skSh In the M may adapt the software to perftrm mmy different types of acalj'SJs.<br>
Grocery stoie or ^exmaricet customer cards liable the stone to compile data mchxdmg Iht buying hsbits of the paxttcular custoner. The software may be ad^ted to use this infotmation to display a smart pivMnpt For instance, if die cnstomo- card indicates d)iat die consumer has purdiased a nunii)er of sugar fiee or &amp;t &amp;ee items in the past, the smart prompt may include a sugar fiee item evun if the consumer has not cnnf ntly brought such an item to the point of puxchase.<br>
In another embodhnent, fl plurality of controllers 12 from different devices can<br>
link over a local area netwodc (!*LASr) to a server conq»uter maiirtained within the<br>
groony ste^ or si9)eimadceL The server computer stores bi^dng habit information,<br>
which is compiled ^nitenever the consumer psqrs by credit or ddiit card. A customer<br>
numbear may be internally assigned to the credit or debit card number» wherein<br>
infojmation is stored under the customer nmnber/ RegsmUess of which standard<br>
checkout or self-scanning checkout the customer uses widiin the store, the server<br>
computer iGcopuzies the credit/d^t number; calls up the customer number and<br>
updittes the buying habit inibimation under the customer number. Further, regardless<br>
of i^hicb standard chedtout or self-scannicg dieckout (he customer uses, the software<br>
is^^ile to access information stored by the server con^uter under the customer number<br>
to provide a smart prompt If the user has purchased a particular product 52 at. the<br>
point of Side in the past, for example, the smart message n^ay include the previously<br>
pujt;hased product 5Z	-	.<br>
In another embodiment, the customer card or silver computer may be adapted to ^iccumulate ^^customa- points^ and automatically dispense one or more point of pun;hase product 52 when the consumer's points reach a predefined threshold. Points ma;r be issued for items 42 that tlae consumer brings to &amp;e point of purdiase, for purchasing point of sale products 52, or botibi. In a quidc service restaurant C^SR*^^ points may be accumulated for fast fi&gt;od items purchased. The points can: (i) yield one or more free products; (ii) lead to an eatry into a contest; and (iii) yield coupons for store itciras, point of purchase products or a contest entry, etc. The display 30 may be adapted to visually and/or audibly inform the consumer, e.g-, **Congratulations» yoxi've eamiid a free pack of gum.**<br><br>
Tlie di^lay 30b is adq&gt;ted for when the store opemxx scans me items 42 using scanner 28 or inputs the items using tbe cash legister 72. Hoe, the display 30b provides a suitable message 74b that pircmqits ihe store opexatcH; after the opetator has scanned or inputted all the purchasable items 42, to request whether tiie consmner wisihes to purchase one of the point of purchase products 52, namely, products A to D* Alictnativcly, Ae operator may pron^t the ww^umer before or while the operator scans or enters the consumer's selected items. The display 30b may also be adapted to pitmpt the irtoie operator to quote the price of a dispensable product 52 or a new total that inchides the price of the dispensable product Si Further, the display 30b 4at pn:nq&gt;ts the store opetator may ixmtain a smart prompt configured based on the products purchased or a user profile.<br>
Jhe display 30b also inovides the buttons 62, wbi<:h the operator presses when consumisr wishes to have a .point of purdiase product immediately di in either tlie consumer controlled or embodiments suitable advertisements fonn static dynamic displays also inform availability point purchase products.></:h>
In Figure 2, the point of pucdtase device 50 has no control capability* i*e«» is a duinb device, and completely relies on the contzoHer 12 to command the dispenser 54 to dispense the products 52. The dispenser 54 may be siny suitable type of dispenser fot dispensing confectionexy products such as chewing gum or candy, periodicals such as maga23nes, books or newsp^ei'S, toiletries sudi as razors or small tissue packets, batteries, cigarette lighters, key chains, writing instruments or small toys.<br>
in &amp;e illustrated embodiment, tiie diq&gt;ebser 54 includes a separate solenoid 72 for each product A to D, The solenoids 72 in an embodiment are push-type solenoids, eai:b having a hot wire 76 and a neutral wire 78. Similarly, the wires 22 coming fiom th

At this point any suitable mechanical linkage may be enq;&gt;loyed to dispense one or moie of die point of purchase {voducts 52. Vw ease of iOffi^liatioUf the dispenser is iUustiatsd as having hinged or slideable doors 82 that open enoii^ to allow one or more of the products A to D fall, due to gravity, onto the lamp or silide SS, wherein the product 52 dispenses througjh the opening 56. Obviously, thosu? of skill in the art can and have devised other medianical hnkages, which may maize more efBcient use of die solenoids 72 or avoid them altogeftier. Importantly* hovrever, in each implementation the initiadon of a particular button 62 has a unique consequence in that it dispenses a specified amount of one of the ptoducts A» B» C or D.<br>
It should be appreciated that since the stand-ali&gt;ne pomt of purchase device SO of Figure 2 has no control capability, the controller 12 accomplishes all the cost accounting. That is, the controller 12 maintains and recalls prices for the purchasable hexQs 42, such as the food box or the hst food items, and the point of purchase pioducts 5Z, such as chewing gum. The consumer controlled touch screen dis{day 30a or the store operator controUed tauch screen display 30b shows a running list of^ scanned or inputted items 42 and dispensed pioducts 52.<br>
Referring now to Figure 3, another embodiment for a stand-alone point of pmchase device 90 is illustrated. The point of purchase lievice 90 has a rudimentary level of control capability. That is, the device 90 does not have processing capability or the ability to store a computer program^ howevo^, die device 90 does have electrical switching capability.   The device 90 includes a po^^er snipply 18 and a plurality of<br><br>
relays 92. Relays aie weU knowo electrical switchiDg devices that contain a coil on an inlet side and one or mopt normally open or nonnaDy closed contacts on an outlet side. The ou^ut side of each relay 92 electrically connects to the solenoids 72» and the inptxt side of each relay electrically connects to an electromechanical pnshbutton 94 according to im electrical flowchart connnonly referred io as a **ladder logic diagnon."<br>
Use point of pmchase device 90 mcluding the rdays 92 has &amp;e cs^ability to enable a conjiumer or a stoie operator to utput a dedsion, at the device 90, to dispense a point of purchase product 52. Hie power si^ly 18 supplies power to the solenoids 72, 'Affough the relays 94, and possibly to the pushbuttaos 94, f
It should be s^)preciated that since the stand-alone jpoint of purchase device 9( has electrical switching capability* but no pmcessinjg caqpability, a separate externa controller 12 must accompli^ all the cost accounting. In itn embodiment, a controlle 12 maintained within a separate automated purctiadng device 70 TnaFintfliiiy! and recall pric es for the purchasable items 42, such as die food box or the last food items, and th point of puidiase products S2&gt; namely, products A to D. llie point of purchase devic 90 sends a signal through the wires 22 to the I/O card or module 20 whenever th consumer or store operator dispens tlie I/O card or module 20, which corresponds to the particular associate cost<br>
Tlie stand-alone point of sale device 90 preferably mounts to or near H automated purchasmg device 70 so diat the device 90 is at the point of purchase. It<br><br>

^.rtor cont^IIed touch screen .display 30b may alternatively couple to the controfler ria wes 22 and/or an RS.232 or FS-485 link. TTic display 30a or 30b alternatively «mraunicatcs with the controller via an RF signal, microwave signal, the Internet or da any other suitable communication link. Either of the displays 30a or 30b shows a mining list of scanned or mputted it<jms and dispensed products></jms>
The controller 12, having the processor 14, memory 16. power sapply 18 and [/O card or module 20, electrically, optically, via KS-232, RS-485. BF signal, imcrowave signal the Internet or by any other suitable communication Imk connects to a stand-alone or band-hdd scanner 28 and/or to a cash register 72. The stand-alone or hand-the scanner 28 includes the transparent cover 40 across which the either the consumer or the store operator passes a purchasable item 42. A store operator preftaably runs the cash registCT 72,<br>
Referring now to Figure 4, a further embodiment for a stand-alone point of purcliase device 100 is illusfrated. The point of purchase device 100 has full control capabiUty. That is, the device 100 can perform electrical svritdhing, has processing capabflity and the ability to store a computer program.  TTie device 100 includes the controller 12 having the processor 14, the memory device 16. the power supply 18 and the I/O card or module 20. The controller 12 enables the point of purchase device 100 to have a touch screen display 30; with simulated buttons 62 for the dispensable products A to D, Either the consumer or the store opeiator presses a button 62 on tt»e scicai 30 !5o that an input signal is sent to die I/O card or module 20, Device software stonal in the memory devicel6 acknowledges the input and commands the closure of a designated output switch on the I/O unit, which allows the power supply 18 to energize the appropriate solenoid 72. Tlie selected pnniuct 52 fells onto the ramp or slide 5 8 and dispenses through the opening 56.<br>
The display 30 can display dynamic advertising for one or more di^ensable products 52 and for one or more suppliers of the products 52. The dynamic displays include still irideo. streaming video and animations as well as any other type of audio, visual or audiovisual display. The display 30 can advertise a plurafity of products- 52<br><br>
at once or run a single video that sequentially displays a plurality of diffezvnt advertisements from one or more suppliers.<br>
In a typical point of purchase enviiionment, smaller soppfieis may not have the means to afioid advertistpg fi&gt;r their point of purcha$e products. For exan^le, providing carclboaid displays or i^ysical niock*ups ai multiple locations is tyincally expeiKsive. The present invention provides a mediod by viid' 30. If the display 30 can adveilise mott than erne product S2 at a time, the suppliers can also pay for a . perctsrtage of the screen and run a *'full-screen ad** or a *lialf-screen a<r or an ad in any miitabie proportion a supplier can for example run half- fifteen peramt of the total advertismg time and fitll screen another percent time.></r>
Tb&amp; controller 12 may be adapted to comiect to one or more server computers maintained by one or more suppliecst of the products 52 by a liziked system commonly refetred to a^; a wide area netwoiic or WAN. Ihe WAN links one or more product sopF^liers by fboa^ Itne, T^l or T-3 counections, leased phone lines, RF signals, mic2x&gt;wav<s or the internet wan provides siq>pli«rs the ability to ^qnlate or change then advertisements in.zeal time, A supplier may wish to run a certain advt^semmt in the morning and another in the afternoon. A supplier may wish to change the iidveitisement based on inventory or to streamline its advertisements with pro<lncts for which the siqiermarfcet or jgrocery places on sal discounts.></lncts>
The ^nsppliers can store a number of advertisements in the memory 16 of the connoUer 12, The controller 12 includes suitable sound and graphics cards to display the advertiriements. The point of purchase devices also include speakers that communicate with the processor 14 of the controller to play piogranuned sounds. The supplier at a remote location selects which adveitiseraent to display and sends a signal over the WAN, wherdln the controiler 12 recalls and displays the desired ad\'ertiscment. Alternatively^ as is lenown by those of skill in the art, the supplier can store the advertisements in files maintained at the supplier's location or on the Internet Wlien the supplio: desires to run a particular advertisement, (he supplier downloads the<br><br>
ile or files ii«&gt;m the remote sender or the Internet to tlie ccmtroHer 12, ^^^<br>

The WAN Unkagc also enables the suppUers of the products 52 to pcifonn av«aitoiymiaiagement iTwt is. the WAN provides the siippficrs the ability to monitor be :aiovcmeat of the products 52 in real time or over a period of tfane, e.g.. hours, days ff ^ireeks. A suppUer can determine whidi products move at particular times of the lay, days of the week or times of the year. This aids the suppUas m supplying Httlucts 52 that wiU sell and also in providing targeted and focused advertising. The jontroller 12 can be configured to saitomaticaUy send a signal to or place a caB to (he supi?Uer or the supplier's distributor when a product supply at the point of purchase ^i to a certain level. The supplier or distributor thereby automatically knows when<br>
lo rwtock the pomt of purchase device.<br>
Uang the real time inventory information provided by the WAN. the Inlemet, etc.. and tibe ability to change advertisements on the fly or in r^ time, the suppHer can tailor advjrtisemeats to push particular products. The supplier can advertise a product 52 it a time that it seUs particularly well to maxfanize througlq»ut The supplier can alternatively attempt to create a market by advertising a product 52 at a time that it has not sold particularly well. Similarly, if the supplier detemiines that there is an abandaace of stock for a particular product 52, the suppKer can advertise that product and/or ruu a special for the product If the point of purchase device enables the consumer to accrue points for pun;hases, the softwars caa be configured to dispense one of the products 52 that is in ample supply when the consumer wins, eg., a free<br>
pack of gum-Obviously, the supplier is not c:q&gt;ected to manually input advertisements at all times. Either the supplier's server computer or die memory 16 of the controller 12 stares sequences that ipc^ude one or more advertisements that cycle continuously. The supplier updates its sequence p«!riodic^ to add* subtract or re-proportion the ad\'ertisement of one or more products 52. The suppKer's sequence integrates with se
 <br>
senses that products B&gt; C and D have sold more Aan Prwliict A, ite software in an anbodimen.t v? piogrammed to advertise product A so as to even the dispensing levels.<br>
The stand-alone point of purchase device 100 has the capability to conttaunicate directly vddi a credit/dd)it card reader 24 and/or an automated puichasing device 70 (not illustrated), sudi as a self-scanning checkout or a standard checlcout Ihe touch screen display 30 enables a product to be dispensed at any time beSoi^ during or after the scamung or cadi registry sequrace.<br>
As usiMl herein^ die term **ciedit/debit card" obviously refers to credit cards and debit cards. The term also refers to any type of identification that enables the consumer to pay for a product ^thoitit using hard correncyy e.g., cash, coins or chedcs. The credit/debit card therefore also itnctudes any type of card or smart card dedicated to a particular institution, such as a school card, retail outlet card, eic, Oiedit/debit cwl also includes phone cards, hotel cards, casino cards or other types of service cards that 'snable the consumer to purchase services and/or goods in a cashless transaction.<br>
Alternatively, after the ccnsumer or the operatw has scanned all the purcbasable items or the store operaitor has entered each item into the cash register^ the creditAld&gt;it card reader 24 prompts the consumer to purchase a dispensable product S2 via ithe card reader di^lay 34. In an embodiment, the i^ard reader display 34 is a vactium florescent display ("VFD"), In a preferred embodiment, the consumer can select a dispimsable product 52 at any time before an dectrcmic lunds transfer takes place, ].e.» birfbre a bank or credit card company authorizi^ the amount. In this way, the i^nsuiQcr makes a single payment.<br>
The i:redit/debit card readeir 24 includes an xosert slot 32 and a plurality of muxterical input buttons 36. If; after inserting a card into the slot 32, the reader 24 camiot read the card number, the consumer can ke^r in the card number using the numerical input buttons 36. The numerical input buttons 36 can also be used to speinfy which product (e,g,. Product #1 to Product #9) to dispense or the quantity of pn^iucts S2 to dispense. The card reader 24 may also be ads^ted to include separate product buttons 102. Ihe VFD 24 directs the consumer to enter a product using either nu£iericalL biput buttons 36 or the dedicated product buttons 102. The card reader 24 in i\n embodiment conrniunicates with the controller 12 of the stand-alone device 100 via wires 22 ^d/or via an RS-232 or RS-485 cable 104.   The card reader 24<br><br>

"Scanneif also includes a devi<:e that reads or accepts any type of signal transmission emanating from the item.></:e>
The controller 12 integral to the scanner 28 may altexnatively be ad^^ted to comiimnicate with the card reader 24 or the bill acceptor via an RF signal, microwave signed, the Internet or via any other s^table communication hnk. When a consmner or store opor^tor scans purchasable items 42 past the ttanspaieat cover 40 of the scann^ 28» the contmller 12 of the scanner 28 accumulates the cost of &amp;e items 42. When the consomer i;e]ects a dispensable product S2 via the buttons 36 or 102 on the credit/ddnt card reader 24, the controller 12 of IJse scanner 28 lecognis^es the input* sends a signal to die point of purchase device 50, 90 ot 100 to dispense the product 52 and accumulates Ihe additional cost of the dispensed pxoduct 52. When the consumer or store operator selects a dispensable product 52 via (he input devices located on the point of purchase devices 90 and KX^, the controller 12 of the scanner 28 recognizes the iaput and accumulates the additional cost of the dispensed product 52,<br><br>
Vfbm a stare operator iop^sts pmchasable items 42 into tiie cash register 72, the controller 12 of the cash legister 72 accumulates the cost of the items 42. The cash re^siter may be stisiptod to have cedsia buttons 106 dedicated to diqicDse the products 52. When the store operator selects a diq&gt;eiisable pnxhict 52 via the button 106 on the cash register 72, the controller 12 of tfie cash zegister 72 recognizes the input, sends a si^al to the point of purchase device 50, 90 or 100 to dispense the jmKluct 52 and accumulates the additional cost of the di^ensed product 52. When the consumer or stotii operator selects a dispeosaible product 52 via the input devices located on the poiot of purchase devices 90 and 100, the controller 12 of the cash register 72 recognizes the input and accunmlates fte additional cost of ithe dispensed product 52.<br>
Dispensing devices 110 that di!q&gt;ense non-consumable items 112 are known to those of skill in the art Genemlly^ die controller 12 integial to the di^enszng device 110 controls a dispenser (not illustrated), whidi dispenses non-eonsomable items 112, sucti as movie tickets or airline tickets. Non-consumable items include any non-edible iteni;$ such as tick^, toiletries and periodicals including magazines^ newsps9&gt;ers and boolcs. The .controller 12 of the dispensiag device 110 may be adapted to couple, via wires 22 mii'cx an RS-232 or RS-4S5 cable 104, to a credit/debit card reader 24 or to a bill acceptor (not illustrated). A touch screen display 30 electrically communicates ^di the controller 12 via wires Zl and/or cable 104. Alternatively, an RF signal, miopowave signal, the Internet or any other suitable coimmonication link may be used. The display 30 has simulated buttons 62 adapted to enable the consumer to select one or more non-consumable items 112 and one or more consumable products 52 from the point of purchase device SO, 90 or 100.<br>
Wlien the consumer selects a non-consumable item 112 via the buttons 62 on the touch sciceen display 30, the controller 12 of the dispensing device 110 recognizes the input, sends a signal to the non-consumable item dispenser to dispense the non-consumable item 112 and accumulates the cost of the di^ensed item 112. When the conimmer selects a consumable product 52 via the buttons 62 on the touch screen display 30, the controller 12 of the dispensing device 110 recognizes the iiq)ut, sends a signal to the point of purchase device 50, 90 or 100 via inires 22 jand/or cable 104 to disp^ense the consumable product 52 and accumulates the additional cost of the<br><br>

Refeniiig now to Hguies 6 and 7, any of the previously disclosed embodiments for the point of purcba^e device SO, 90 or 100 may liirtlbier be adapted jR&gt;r a quick service resbiwant TQSRO- QSBCs are continuously looldog ^r tecbnologies that alleriate their limited i^pace and labor issues, increase operational efisdencies and mitigate product shrinkage. QSR's typically reqmie jQoor space m front of the cashiers to be open, wherein customers form lines, peruse oyeibead menus and order food upon appinoacbing a cashier. Thus while QSR'S provide a ce^tive madcet ior point of pun^hase products, thc^^ do not provide a convenient place for a typical grocery store laci:.<br>
Drive tixrou^ stands also provide a captive fiont-^aid maike^Iace. Outdoor dri^e through stands^ however, do not provide a suitable locadon for a product rack. Shrinkage^ both inside and at the ihive through stan4 poses a serious barrier to the introduction of fiont*eiad products,. Cashiers at QSR's, who must defiver prepared food itCTtts jss well as receive and cfxchange maney, do not have onougb extra time to ensure that oH-tbe-iack items are accounted for. It should be appreciated, however, that any of the point of purchase devices SO, 90 or 100 are operable in a QSR eoVitonmenL<br>
Figutrc 6 illustrates the poiat of purchase device SO, 90 or 100 implemeated in^de the QSR at the cashier station. The cashier 114 stands behind the QSR counter Il€L Th£t customer 118 observes s\n oveihead displ^^ 122 that sets forth a number of fast; food itisms 42 that the QSR j&gt;repares and brings to the point of purchase. Tlic disj^lay 1:22 also presents a number of products 52 that the customer 118 can purchase and! that will immediately be £q&gt;eiised at the point of purchase.<br>
Tliie point of pinchase device SO, 90 or 100, mcluding the dispenser 54 (not iDustrated), fiush mounts to the backside of the cash register and includes a touch scr sen diisplay 30, The cash register/point of purchase device 50» 90 or 100 includes a controller having a processor and a memory that stated a program. In an embodiment, as ^oon as ifae cashier 114 begins to enter the order of the customer 118, the program and the pn:»cessor cooperate to display the message 124 and activate the simulated input buttons 62. When the cashiisr 114 enters a payment fiom the customer 118, the<br><br>
pmipram and the processor cooperate to discontinue &amp;e noessage 124 and deactivate the simulatetcl it^ut buttoie 62. At any time in betweian, the customer 118 can select one of tbe input buttons 62, wherein a product 52 di^enses tbtcm^ an openxng 56 into a tety 142 (whidb can also be (he coin change tr^, see figure 9 below) and the cost of the prodnct 52 automatically accumulates with the cost of the &amp;st food items 42.<br>
Tbe procedure above is virtually inviable to &amp;e cashier 114. The QSR em{&gt;k&gt;yee» or the product suppliers can restock tbe products 52 during non-business hours* In an alternative embodiment, &amp;e point of purchase device 50, 90 or 100 prompts the cashier 114 to ask the customer 118 to purdiase one or more products 52. A secoi^ dispenser 126 mounts inside the counter 116 and dispenses periodicals or othi:r consumable or non-consumable products 52. The seccmd di^&gt;ens6r 126 can operate accoinfing to the computer program discussed above^ wbercm the customer 118 pUF:diases a jnagarine or sewspq)er by pressmg a button 62 while ordering the items 42. Altemfitively, tiie customer 118 requests a periodical fiom the cashier 114, wb:rein the cashier 114 presses a button on the cash regist^, a door on the dispenser 126 opens, i|be customer 118 removes the selected product 52 and the cost of iht product automaticany adds to the cost of the £ist food items 42. Bach of these end»o(fiments consumes no floor space and requires litUe ejEfoit by the cashier 114.<br>
Figure 7 illustrates the point of purchase device 50, 90 or 100 implemented outside tliLe QSR at ttie drive-up window. QSR's typically emjploy a display^ such as the overfaesid display 122 of Figure 6, at a drive^through ordering station (not iOsstrated). This di^lay can present the point of purchase products 52. as does the displ^ 122 of Figure 6« In (he illustrated embodiment, the drive-tq&gt; customer 118 encounters a toucb screen display 30 having simulated input buttons 62 ^en tfie customer 118 pulls up to Ae exchange window. As the customer 118 waits for the fast focid, the message 128 prompts the customer 118 to purchase^ e.g., a pack of gum* ' Additionalls^ or alternatively, the ctisbier (not illustrated} can prompt the customer 118 to purchase a product 52* If the cizstomer selects a button 62, a product 52 dispenses through the opening 56 into the tray 142 (in an emboiliment with coin change as discussed with Figure 9) and the cost of thei»oduct 52 automatically accumulates with thc^ cost of tbe &amp;st food items 42. Suitable precautions may be employed to counteract pn)duct shrinkage, sux^ as automaticaUy deactivating the buttons 52 before accepting<br><br>
