Preparation of molecularly imprinted poly(2-hydroxy ethyl methacrylate) as a cholesterol recognizing polymer:<br>
Example 1<br>
To 3-5 ml of 2-hydroxy ethyl methacrylate, 12-20ml of methanol is added followed by 250-300mg of cholesterol. The mixture is stirred magnetically to dissolve cholesterol. The solution is then transferred into test tubes flushed with<br>
nitrogen and scaled. The content is subjected to gamma<br>
60 irradiation from a Co  source to 0.total dose of 0.3 Mrads.<br>
After the polymerization, the test tube is broken and the<br>
polymer is extracted with methanol and then with chloroform.<br>
The polymer is then dried at 30 ° C in an vacuum oven and<br>
powdered.<br>
40-50 mg of the molecularly imprinted polymer is placed in a methanol solution of cholesterol and testosterone, a molecule having the similar ring structure of cholesterol, at 37 C for 30 nin. The polymer is then removed by filtrations and dried in vacuum. The amount of cholesterol and testosterone in the polymer are estimated using chromatographic techniques. The extent of uptake of testosterone by the polymer is negligibly small (5-10 UO/lOOmg of polymer) inspire of the similar structure to cholesterol. The uptake of cholesterol is 280-300 μg/100mg of the polymer indicating high degree of selectivity of the polymer towards cholesterol.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
This invention relates to the synthesis of molecularly imprinted polymers by gamma irradiation for the use as selective adsorbent and sensor component.<br>
Molecular imprinting is an emerging technique to prepare synthetic polymers with predetermined selectivity for various components for developing recognizing systems comparable to biological process of recognition. A widely practiced approach of the technique involves the non covalent prearrangement of functional monomers in the presence of a print molecule prior to polymerization, once the polymerization is completed, the print molecules are removed and the macro porous polymer matrix retains the memory towards the print molecules which are known to be due to the shape and arrangement of the functional groups.<br>
Molecularly imprinted polymers have been synthesized in the presence of print molecules either by photo polymerization or by the thermal polymerization. In both cases additional ingredients like photo initiators, catalysts etc are added to aid the polymerization.  A<br><br>
disadvantage associated with such known process is that presence of extra additives may reduce the effectiveness of the interaction between the monomer and the print molecules adversely affecting the density of recognition sites in the polymer. Additionally print molecules of biological origin are susceptible to thermal damage as well as sensitive to UV radiation.<br>
An object of this invention is to propose the synthesis of molecularly imprinted polymers by gamma irradiation for the use as selective adsorbent and sensor component.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose the synthesis of molecularly imprinted polymers by gamma irradiation for the use as selective adsorbent and sensor component which avoids the use of polymerization aids like catalysts, initiators etc.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose the synthesis of molecularly imprinted polymers by gamma irradiation for the use as selective adsorbent and sensor component which can be carried out at room temperature which is an additional advantage.<br><br>
A further object of this invention is to propose the	synthesis of<br>
molecularly  imprinted polymers by gamma irradiation	for the  use<br>
as  selective  adsorbent and sensor component  thick	is  simple,<br>
rapid and comparatively more effective.<br>
Further  objects  and advantages of this invention will  be  more apparent from the ensuing description.<br>
Thus according to this invention is provided a process for the synthesis of molecularly imprinted polymer by gamma irradiation as selective adsorbent and sensor component comprising in the steps of dissolving a vinyl monomer and a print molecule such as . steroids in a solvent such as herein described, adding a cross linker such as herein described in a proportion of 3 to 10 times the weight of the monomer, subjecting the same to gamma irradiation to a total dose of 0.24 to 0.5 Mrads to produce said polymer, extracting the irradiated mixture with at least one solvent such as methanol and chloroform to remove the print molecules, subjecting said polymer to vacuum drying and powdering to obtain said molecularly imprinted polymer.<br>
In accordance with this invention, vinyl monomers like  2-hydroxy<br>
ethyl  methacrylate, a print molecule  like  cholesterol  and a<br>
crosslinker are  dissolved in a suitable solvent  like  methanol.<br>
60 The solution is subjected to gamma irradiation froma CO    source<br>
to a total dose of 0.24-0.5 Mrads.<br><br>
The cross linker used is an ester of ethylene glycol such as ethylene glycol dimethacry1 ate. It is used in a proportion of 3 to 10 tirades the quantity of the vinyl monomer depending upon the application of the molecularly imprinted polymer.<br><br><br>
Preparation   of  molecular/y  imprinted   poly(2-hydroxy   ethyl methacrylate as a cholesterol recognizing polymer<br>
Example 1<br>
To  3-5 nl of 2-hydroxy ethyl nethacry1 ate, 12-20 ml of  methanol<br>
is  added  followed  by 250-300 mg of  cholesterol  and  ethylene<br>
glycol  dimethacrylate.  The mixture is stirred  magnetically  to<br>
dissolve cholesterol. The solution is then transferred into  test<br>
tubes flushed with nitrogen and sealed. The content is  subjected<br>
60 to  gamma irradiation from a Co   source to a total dose  of  0.3<br>
Mrads. After the polymerizations, the test tube is broken and  the<br>
polymer is extracted with methanol and then with chloroform.  The<br>
o polymer is then dried at 50 C in a vacuum oven and powdered.<br>
40-50  mg  of the molecularly imprinted polymer is  placed  in  a<br>
methanol  solution  of cholesterol and testosterone,  a  molecule<br>
o having the similar ring structure of cholesterol, at 37 C for  30<br>
mins..  The  polymer is then removed by filtration and  dried  in<br>
a vacuum. The amount 	<br><br>
of cholesterol and testosterone in the polymer are estimated using chromatographic techniques. The extent of uptake of testosterone by the polymer is negligibly small (5-10 ug/100 mg of polymer) inspire of the similar structure to cholesterol. The uptake of cholesterol is 280-300 ug/100 mg of the polymer indicating high degree of selectivity of the polymer towards cholesterol.<br>
Differential scanning calorimetric is used to estimate the melting point of cholesterol present in the polymer. The appearance of an endoderm around 147°C, characteristic of the melting point of cholesterol, indicates that the physic chemical characteristics of the cholesterol present in the polymer are intact reflecting the feasibility of using molecularly imprinted polymer for selectively removing biologically active component from mixtures.<br><br><br>
