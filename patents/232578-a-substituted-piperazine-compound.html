				<td>FIELD OFINVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to melanocortin receptor-specific compounds The present invent,on also relates to tetra-and penta-substituted piperazine and piperazine-derivative ring compounds, the ring compounds optionally including one C=0 or C=S member, that bind to one or more melanocortin receptors and are optionally agonists, antagonists, mixed agonist-antagonists or inverse agonists with respect to one or more melanocortin, receptors, and use thereof for the treatment of metabolic, immune, infection-related and melanocortin receptor-mediated disorders<br>
Description of Related Art:<br>
Note that the following discussion refers to a number of publications by authors) and year of publication, and that due to recent publication dates certain publications are not to be considered as prior art vis-a-vis the present invention. Discussion of such publications herein Is given for more complete background and Is not to be construed as an admission that such publications are prior art for patentability determination purposes.<br>
Piperazines are an important class of molecular templates that have been employed in the development of several drugs. However, in the prior art generally only mono- or di-substituted piperazine templates have been employed. In a few Instances a tri-substituted piperazine has been employed, such as Indinavir (Merck), an HIV protease inhibitor drug that Incorporates a tri-substftuted piperazine.<br>
Melanocortin Receptor-Specific Agents. A family of melanocortin receptor types and subtypes have been identified, including melanocortin 1 receptors (MC1-R) expressed on normal human' melanocytes and melanoma cells, melanocortin 2 receptors (MC2-R) for adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) expressed in cells of the adrenal gland, melanocortin 3 and melanocortin 4 receptors (MC3-<br><br>
R and MC4-R), expressed primarily in cells in the hypothalamus, mid-brain and brainstem, and melanocortin 5 receptors (MC5-R), expressed in a wide distribution of tissues.<br>
In general, compounds specific for MC1-R are believed to be useful for treatment of melanoma. Compounds specific for MC3-R or MC4-R are believed to be useful In regulation of energy homeostasis, Including use as agents for attenuating food intake and body weight gain, for use In treatment of anorexia and cachexia, for treatment of obesity, and treatment of other food Intake and metabolism-related indications. Compounds specific for MC3-R and MC4-R, among other melanocortin receptors, can further be used as agents for treatment of sexual dysfunction, Including male erectile dysfunction. Other clinical uses are being explored, such as use of MC4-R antagonists as anxiolytic or antidepressant drugs. Other melanocortin receptor-specific compounds, such as MCR-1 agonists, can be used as tanning agents to increase melanin production in the skin, acting as chemo-preventive agents against harmful effects of UV solar radiation. Compounds specific for MCR-1 and MCR-3 may further be useful in regulation of inflammatory processes. Compounds specific for MCR-5 may be used for treatment of acne and related skin disorders due to over stimulation of sebaceous gland. Compounds specific for MCR-4 and MCR-5 may be used for treatment of depression. Compounds specific for MCR-3 may find use as a therapeutic for treating salt-Induced hypertension. In general, the melanocortin system Is involved in diverse physiological functions, Including energy balance, pigmentation, sexual function and Inflammation.<br>
The mechanism of action of compounds specific for MC3-R or MC4-R as agents for attenuating food intake and body weight gain has not been fully elucidated. While most reports suggest that MC4-R agonists may be employed for attenuating food intake and body weight gain, It is clear that agouti-related protein (AgRP), an endogenous inverse agonist, plays a critical role in the regulatory system. At least one group has suggested that a neutral antagonist of AgRP may produce agonist-like effects in vivo. (Man, R.A.H. and Kas, M.J.H. Inverse agonist gains weight. TRENDS in Pharmacological Sciences 24(6):315-321, 2003.) However, no such compounds have heretofore been described. Further, all or virtually all MC4-R agonists compounds reported for attenuating food intake or body weight gain in animal models have shown a "rebound" effect, with animals gaining weight equal to or, in most instances, exceeding controls on cessation of<br>
adminlstration of the compounds. There is thus a need for compounds which attenuate food intake or body weight gain without causing a rebound effect on cessation of administration of the compound.<br>
There is a significant need for compounds with high specificity for discrete melanocortin receptors, as well as for compounds that are agonists, inverse agonists, antagonists, or otherwise bind to specific melanocortin receptors. High affinity compounds for melanocortin receptors can be used to exploit varied physiological responses associated with melanocortin receptors, as agonists, antagonists, inverse agonists or otherwise. In addition, melanocortin receptors have an effect on the activity of various cytokines, and high affinity compounds for melanocortin receptors can be used to regulate cytokine activity.<br>
Plperazine Compounds. There are piperazine and piperidine compounds known, such as those disclosed in WO 03/009850 (Amgen), WO 03/009847 (Amgen), WO 03/094918 (Neurocrine Biosciences), WO 03/1093234 (Procter &amp; Gamble). WO 03/092690 (Procter &amp; Gamble), WO 03/061660 (Eli Lilly and Company), WO 03/053927 (Taisho Pharm.), WO 03/031410 (Neurocrine Biosciences), WO 03/007949 (Merck &amp; Co.), WO 02/092566 (Taisho Pharm.), WO 02/079146 (Bristol-Myers Squibb Company), WO 02/070511 (Bristol-Myers Squibb Company), WO 02/068388 (Merck &amp; Co.), WO 02/068387 (Merck &amp; Co.), WO 02/067869 (Merck &amp; Co.), WO 02/059095 (Eli Lilly and Company), WO 02/00259 (Taisho Pharm.), and WO 00/74679 (Merck &amp; Co.), asserted to be specific for melanocortin or related receptors. However, in general such compounds have at most two functional substituted groups, have relatively poor affinity and specificity, and are not suitable for use as a drug compound. There is a significant need for compounds with high specificity for discrete receptors, such as specific melanocortin receptors, as well as compounds that are agonists, Inverse agonists, or antagonists for such receptors. High affinity compounds for such receptors can be used to exploit varied physiological responses associated with the receptors, either as agonists or antagonists. There is thus a need for compounds that are more selective, including higher affinity and specificity, and In particular for compounds that have at least four biologically active substituted groups. This Invention addresses that need.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In this Invention it is disclosed that piperazine rings, including piperazine ring derivatives, may be employed with at least four descriptors, wherein each descriptor is a separate pendant group unique to a given ring atom. By employing four or five descriptors, the inventors have further found that the chirality of the ring, and stereo structure generally, Is fixed In a desired structure, thereby more closely mimicking the desired pharmacophores, and with the descriptors positioned in the most relevant chemical space.<br>
This Invention thus discloses the use of tetra- or penta-substituted piperazine and related derivative templates for drug design. The invention further also relates to enantlomerically pure tetra-substltuted plperazfnes, preferably made by the synthetic schemes disclosed herein or variants thereof. A classic piperazine ring is a conformationally dynamic six-membered ring structure. It can exist In a variety of conformatlonal states, commonly referred to as chair, boat, twisted chair or twisted boat conformations. Because of this dynamism in structural states, the location of descriptors on the ring plays an important role in stabilizing the ring in a single conformational state; if the appropriate conformational state is selected, this is conducive to making a molecule more selective for Its receptor In terms of binding affinity and intrinsic functional activity. For example, a 1,3 axial placement of two bulky descriptors generally causes unfavorable sterlc interactions between these two groups, and thus make a chair conformation energetically less stable. Consequently, the chair conformation Is less preferred, resulting in a twisted chair or boat conformation. The twisted chair or boat conformation results in a specific stereochemical alignment<br>
of the descriptors, which is specifically relevant to interaction with the desired receptor. .Thus a conformation resulting from 1,3 axial placement of two descriptors may result in a structure more selective for a given receptor sub-type.<br>
In one broad aspect, the Invention describes and discloses the use of tetra- or penta-substltuted piperazine and related piperazine-derivative ring compounds as biologically active agents. In a related aspect, the invention describes and discloses the use of tetra- or penta-substituted piperazine and related piperazine-derivative ring compounds as mlmetics of desired pharmacophores, including but not limited to pharmacophores derived from biologically active matallopeptides, which biologically active metallopeptides may in turn be derived from biologically active peptides, polypeptides or proteins.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the invention describes tetra- or penta-substituted piperazine and related pipefazine-derivative ring compounds specific for G-protein coupled receptor systems, such systems including, but not limited to, melanotropln or melanocortin receptors (MC1-R, MC3-R, MC4-R and MC5-R).<br>
In yet another embodiment, the invention provides novel schemes and methods of synthesis of tetra-substltuted piperazine and related piperazine-derivative ring compounds.<br>

"Erectile dysfunction" is a disorder involving the failure of a male mammal to achieve functional erection, ejaculation, or both. Erectile dysfunction is accordingly synonymous with<br>
impotence, and includes the inability to attain or sustain an erection of sufficient rigidity for coitus. Symptoms of erectile dysfunction include an inability to achieve or maintain an erection, ejaculatory failure, premature ejaculation, or inability to achieve an orgasm. An increase in erectile dysfunction is often associated with age or may be caused by a physical disease or as a side-effect of drug treatment.<br>
"Female sexual dysfunction" is a disorder including sexual arousal disorder. The term "sexual arousal disorder" includes a persistent or recurrent failure to attain or maintain the lubrication-swelling response of sexual excitement until completion of sexual activity. Sexual dysfunction in females can also include inhibited orgasm and dyspareunia, which Is painful or difficult coitus. Female sexual dysfunction Includes, but is not limited to, a number of categories of diseases, conditions and disorders Including hypoactive sexual desire disorder, sexual anhedonia, sexual arousal disorder, dyspareunia and vaginismus. Hypoactive sexual desire disorder includes a disorder in which sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity are persistently or recurrently diminished or absent, causing marked distress or interpersonal difficulties. Hypoactive sexual desire disorder can be related to boredom or unhappiness in a long-standing relationship, depression, dependence on alcohol or psychoactive drugs, side effects from prescription drugs, or hormonal deficiencies. Sexual anhedonia includes decreased or absent pleasure in sexual activity. Sexual anhedonia can be caused by depression, drugs, or interpersonal factors. Sexual arousal disorder can be caused by reduced estrogen, illness, or treatment with diuretics, antihistamines, antldepressants, or antihypertensive agents. Dyspareunia and vaginismus are sexual pain disorders characterized by pain resulting from penetration and may be caused, for example, by medications which reduce lubrication, endometrlosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, inflammatory bowel disease or urinary tract problems.<br>
By a melanocortin receptor "agonist" is meant an endogenous or drug substance or compound, including a compound of this invention that can interact with a melanocortin receptor and initiate a pharmacological response, including but not limited to adenyl cyclase expression, characteristic of the melanocortin receptor. By a melanocortin receptor "antagonist" is meant a drug or a compound, Including a compound of this invention, that opposes the melanocortin receptor-<br>
-associated responses normally induced by a melanocortin receptor agonist agent, but without itself Initiating a pharmacological response characteristic of the melanocortin receptor, such as increasing or decreasing adenyl cyclase expression. By a melanocortin receptor "inverse agonist" is meant a drug or a compound, including a compound of this invention, that is an antagonist with respect to an agonist, and which by itself induces or initiates a pharmacological response characteristic of the melanocortin receptor, such as reducing basal or constitutive adenyl cyclase expression.<br>
By "binding affinity"'is meant the ability of a compound or drug to bind to its biological target.<br>
By "intrinsic activity" is meant the maximal stimulation of adenyl cyclase achievable by a compound in a melanocortin receptor cell system. The maximal stimulation achieved by α-MSH or NDP-α-MSH is designated as an intrinsic activity of 1.0 (or 100%) and a compound capable of stimulating half the maximal activity that of a-MSH or NDP-a-MSH is designated as having an intrinsic activity of 0.5 (or 50%). A compound of this invention that under assay conditions described herein has an intrinsic activity of 0.7 (70%) or higher is classified as an agonist, a compound with intrinsic activity between 0.1 (10%) and 0.7 (70%) is classified as a partial agonist, and a compound with intrinsic activity below 0.1 (10%) is classified as inactive or having no intrinsic activity. Compounds with intrinsic activity below 0.1 (10%) were further evaluated, as indicated herein, for antagonist effect.<br>
Clinical Applications. The compounds disclosed herein can be used for both medical applications and animal husbandry or veterinary applications. Typically, the product is used in humans, but may also be used in other mammals. The term "patient" is intended to denote a mammalian individual, and is so used throughout the specification and in the claims. The primary applications of this invention involve human patients, but this invention may be applied to laboratory, farm, zoo, wildlife, pet, sport or other animals.<br>
Melanocortin receptor-specific compounds of this invention that are MC1-R specific can be used as chemoprevention agents against sun-induced, such as by UV radiation, neoplastic activity In human skin. MC1-R agonist compounds of this invention may be employed to stimulate epidermal melanocytes to produce melanin as well as to convert pheomelanin to eumelanin. Eumelanin, which is dark brown or black pigmentation, is considered more photo-protective than<br>
pheomelanin, which is yellow or red pigmentation. The process of melanogenesis is believed to involve stimulation of MC1-R in epidermal m'elanocytes, thereby mediating the stimulation of tyrosinase enzymes within these pigment cells, inducing the conversion of tyrosine to dopa and then through dopaquinone to eumelanin. Sun tanning due to direct sun exposure is proposed to result from the same pathway by local production of melanotropic peptide from a POMC gene in the epidermis. Thus stimulation of eumelanin production and conversion of pheomelanin to eumelanin may be a desirable chemoprevention modality in blocking sun- or UV-induced neoplastic activity in skin. A potent, high-affinity and highly selective MC1-R agonist peptidomimetic compound of this inv/ention can accordingly be used as a therapeutic chemoprevention agent for combating harmful sun or UV exposure that induces neoplastic activity in skin melanocytes.<br>
In another embodiment, compounds of this invention that are MC4-R agonists can be used as a therapeutic agent to modify energy metabolism and feeding behavior, including treatment of pathologic obesity and related conditions. Compounds of this invention that are MC4-R antagonists can be used as a therapeutic agent in eating disorders, such as treatment of anorexia and cachexia, which is malnutrition and wasting due to illness. Control centers for eating and satiety reside in the hypothalamus. These responses are determined by diverse hormones and soluble factors that signal through specific receptors in the hypothalamus. MC4-R is known to be expressed in the brain, and inactivation of this receptor by gene targeting has resulted in mice with a maturity-onset obesity syndrome associated with hyperphagia, hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia.<br>
This invention include compounds that are MC4-R agonists or partial agonists with demonstrated efficacy, in animal models, in modifying energy metabolism and feeding behavior, and further includes compounds that are inactive or have no intrinsic activity with respect to MC4-R, but bind MC4-R with high affinity and, in some instances, selectivity, and further have demonstrated efficacy, in animal models, in modifying energy metabolism and feeding behavior. It is hypothesized, without desiring to be bound by theory, that at least some compounds of this invention that bind MC4-R with high affinity are neutral antagonists of the inverse agonist AgRP, but independently are inactive or have no intrinsic activity with respect to MC4-R, and that such<br>
compounds may be used as a therapeutic agent to modify energy metabolism and feeding behavior, Including treatment of pathologic obesity and related conditions.<br>

Drugs that reduce energy intake include, in part, various pharmacological agents, referred to as anorectic drugs, which are used as adjuncts to behavioral therapy In weight reduction programs. Classes of anorectic drugs include, but are not limited to, noradrenergic and serotonergic agents. Noradrenerglc medications may be described as those medications generally preserving the anorectic effects of amphetamines but with weaker stimulant activity. The noradrenergic drugs, except phenylpropanolamine, generally act through a centrally mediated pathway In the hypothalamus that causes anorexia. Phenylpropanolamine, a racemlc mixture of norephedrine esters, causes a release of norepinephrine throughout the body and stimulates hypothalamic adrenoreceptors to reduce appetite.<br>
Suitable noradrenergic agents include, but are not limited to, diethylpropion such as TENUATE™ (1-propanone, 2-(diethylamino)-1-phenyl-, hydrochloride) commercially available from Merrell; mazindol (or 5-(p-chlorophenyl)-2,5-dihydro-3H-imidazot2,1-a]lsolndo!-5-ol) such as SANOREX™ commercially available from Novartis or MAZANOR™ commercially available from Wyeth Ayerst; phenylpropanolamine (or Benzenemethanol, alpha-(l-aminoethyl)-, hydrochloride);<br>
phentermine (or Phenol, 3-[[4,5-duhydro-1H-lmidazol-2-yl)ethyi](4-methylpheny[)amino], monohydrochloride) such as ADIPEX-P™ commercially available from Lemmon, FASTIN™ commercially available from Smith-Kline Beecham and lonamin™ commercially available from Medeva; phendimetrazine (or (2S,3S)-3,4-Dlmethyl-2phenylmorpholine L-(+)-tartrate (1:1)) such as METRA™ commercially available from Forest, PLEGINE™ commercially available from Wyeth-Ayerst; PRELU-2™ commercially available from Boehringer Ingelheim, and STATOBEX™ commercially available from Lemmon; phendamine tartrate such as THEPHORIN™ (2,3,4,9-Tetrahydro-2-methyl-9-phenyl-1 H-indenol[2,1-c]pyridine L-{+)artrate (1:1)) commercially available from Hoffmann-LaRoche; methamphetamine such as DESOXYN™ Tablets ((S)-N, (alpha)-dlmethylbenzeneethanamine hydrochloride) commercially available from Abbott; and phendimetrazine tartrate such as BONTRIL™ Slow-Release Capsules (-3,4-Dtmethyl-2-phenylmorpholine Tartrate) commercially available from Amarin.<br>
Suitable non-limiting serotonergic agents include sibutramine such as MERIDIA™ capsules (a racemlc mixture of the (+) and (-) enantlomers of cyclobutanemethanamlne, 1 -(4-chlorophenyl)-N,N-dlmethyl-(alpha)-(2-metr)ylpropyl)-, hydrochloride, monohydrate) commercially available from-Knoll, fenfluramlne such as Pondimin™ (Benzeneethanamine, N-ethyl-alpha-methyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)-, hydrochloride) commercially available from Robbins; dexfenfluramine such as Redux™ (Benzeneethanamine, N-ethyl-alpha-methyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)-, hydrochioride) commercially available from Interneuron. Fenfiuramine and dexfenfluramine stimulate release of serotonin and inhibit its reuptake. Sibutramine inhibits the reuptake of serotonin, noreplnephrine and dopamine, but does not stimulate secretion of serotonin.<br>
Other serotonergic agents useful with the practice of the present Invention include, but are not limited to, certain auoretlc gene 5HT1 a inhibitors (brain, serotonin) such as carbidopa and benserazide as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 6,207,699 which Is incorporated herein by reference; and certain neuroklnin 1 receptor antagonists and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors Including fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxtine, sertraline and other useful compounds as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 6,162,805 which is incorporated herein by reference. Other potential inhibitors that may be employed Include 5HT2c inhibitors.<br>
Other useful compounds for reducing energy intake include, but are not limited to, certain aryl-substituted cyclobutylalkylamines as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 6,127,424 which is incorporated herein by reference; certain trifluoromethylthiophenylethylamine derivatives as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 4,148,923 which is incorporated herein by reference; certain compounds as disclosed by U.S. Pat.

No. 6,140,354 which is incorporated herein by reference; and certain alpha-blocking agents as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 4,239,763 which Is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Moreover, several peptides and hormones regulate feeding behavior. For example, cholecystokinin and serotonin act to decrease appetite and food intake. Leptin, a hormone produced by fat cells, controls food intake and energy expenditure. In obese persons who are losing weight without medications, a decrease in weight is associated with a decrease in circulating levels of leptin, suggesting Its role in weight homeostasls. Obese patients with high leptin levels are thought to have peripheral leptin resistance secondary to the down-regulation of leptin receptors. • Non-limiting examples of useful compounds affecting feeding behavior include certain leptin-lipolysls stimulated receptors as disclosed by WO 01/21647 which is incorporated herein by reference; certain phosphodlesterase enzyme inhibitors as disclosed by WO 01/35970 which is incorporated herein by reference; certain compounds having nucleotide sequences of the mahogany gene as disclosed by WO 00/05373 which is incorporated herein by reference; and certain sapogenin compounds as disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 4,680,289 which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Other useful compounds Include certain gamma peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) agonists as disclosed by WO 01/30343 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,033,656 which are incorporated herein by reference and certain polypeptides such as fibroblast growth factor-10 poiypeptides as disclosed by WO 01/18210 which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Moreover, monoamine oxidase inhibitors that decrease energy Intake or Increase energy expenditure are useful with the practice of the present Invention. Suitable, but non-limiting examples of monoamine oxidase inhibitors Include befloxatone, moclobemide, brofaromine, phenoxathine,<br>

Nutrient partitioning agents and digestive inhibitors are another strategy in the treatment of obesity by interfering with the breakdown, digestion or absorption of dietary fat in the gastrointestinal tract. Gastric and pancreatic lipases aid in the digestion of dietary trtglycerides by forming them into free fatty acids that are then absorbed in the small intestine. Inhibition of these enzymes leads to inhibition of the digestion of dietary triglycerides. Non-limiting examples Include a lipase inhibitor, ortistat, such as XENICAL™ capsules ((S)-2-formylamlno-4-methyl-pentanoic acid (S)-1-[[(2S, 3S)-3-hexyl-4-oxo-2-oxetanyl]methyl]-dodecyl ester) commercially available from Roche Laboratories and certain benzoxazinone compounds as described by WO 00/40247 which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Agents that increase energy expenditure are also referred to as thermogenic medications. Non-limiting examples of suitable thermogenlc medications include xanthines, such as caffeine and theophylline, selective ß-3-adrenergic agonists for example certain compounds in U.S. Pat. No. 4,626,549 which is Incorporated by reference herein, and a-2-adrenergic and growth hormones compounds as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,937,267 and 5,120,713 which are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Generally, a total dosage of the above-described obesity control agents or medications, when used In combination with a compound of this invention can range from 0.1 to 3,000 mg/day, preferably from about 1 to 1,000 mg/day and more preferably from about 1 to 200 mg/day In single or 2-4 divided doses. The exact dose, however, is determined by the attending clinician and is dependent on such factors as the potency of the compound administered, the age, weight, condition and response of the patient.<br>
Agents or drugs employed for increasing food intake and/or body weight include appetite stimulants such as megastrol acetate, adrenocorticoids such as prednisolone and dexamethasone, cyproheptidine, serotonergic drugs such as fenfluramine, neuropeptide Y, and androgen antagonists such as flutamide, nilutamide, and zanoterone.<br>
Compounds of the Invention. As discussed hereafter in the synthetic schemes, one preferred method of making the compounds of the invention includes synthesis of a linear Intermediate composed of chiral building blocks such as amino acid residues or derivatives, which Intermediate includes the R1 group and an R2 group, and one of or, if provided, both an R4 and R5 group, as shown below. The linear intermediate is then cyclicized, and other groups, such as R3, are then added. Thus in this embodiment R1 and R4 can be considered to be amino acid side chain moieties, as defined above. In other of the synthetic schemes, the linear intermediate includes the R2 group, and one of R4 or R6, with the R1 group synthetically added post-cyclization. In the synthetic methods the R3 group is an amino acid residue or derivative, optionally with an amine capping group, second amino acid residue or derivative, or second amino acid residue or derivative and amine capping group. It may thus be seen that the compounds of the invention may be considered as a 6-membered ring compound of the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein:<br>
X is CH2, C=0 or C=S;<br>
R1 is an amino acid side chain rnoiety Including at least one carbocyclic aromatic or non-aromatic ring or heterocyclic aromatic ring, and in a preferred embodiment includes a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl, naphthyl or indole group;<br>
R2 is an amino acid side chain moiety with at least one heteroatom cationic center, hydrogen bond donor or hydrogen bond acceptor, wherein the least one heteroatom is nitrogen or oxygen;<br>
R3 includes at least one amino acid residue with at least one carbocyclic aromatic ring and in a preferred embodiment, includes a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl or naphthyl group; and<br>
At least one of R4 and R5 is R2 or a C1 to C5 aliphatic linear or branched chain. It may readily be seen that the foregoing description is simplified, in that at each of R2, R4 and R6 there is assumed to further be a hydrogen atom bound to the respective ring carbon.<br>

Modulation of functional activity of the compounds of this invention.  The efficacy and functional activity of compounds of this invention can be modulated by selection of the linker units and other substituents, such as R4 and/or R5 groups, which influence the conformational biasness of R1 and R3groups. Efficacy and functional activity may be determined by any number of means, such as assaying the stimulation of adenyl cyclase in a cAMP assay as hereafter described.<br>
For example, the chemical nature of either or both the L1or L3 linker units, and the incorporation of a substityent at one or more specific R4a, R4b, Rsa or R5b positions, can change otherwise identical compounds from a partial agonist to a full agonist as determined by adenyl cyclase assays in an hMCR-4 transfected HEK cell system. The nature and character of these changes is described, in part, in the following discussion.<br>
A commercially available computer based molecular modeling software system, such as Alchemy (Tripos), can be used to study the conformational dynamics within the compounds of this invention. Studies using such a molecular modeling software system can explain, in part, the effect of changes such as the chemical nature of either or both the L1 or L3 linker units or the incorporation of a substituent at one or more specific R4a, R4bl R5a or R5b positions on biological activity.<br>
A piperazine ring can exhibit conform ational dynamics between chair and boat conformations, with twisted chair and twisted boat conformations being special cases. In the following discussion, chair and boat conformations are used for purposes of illustration. Assume a piperazine, where X is CH2, and a conventional ring atom numbering system as follows:<br>
+(Formula Removed)<br>
As may readily be seen, both the 1 and 4 position nitrogens are substituted with an R group. As a direct result thereof, the conformation of the ring is biased toward a chair conformation, because this conformation offers a very low likelihood of steric interactions involving aromatic R1 and R3 groups. This may be seen in the following illustration, wherein the equatorial placement of R1 and R3 in the Chair Form results in a conformationally preferred structure, while the close proximity of the ring nitrogens with R1 and R3 groups in the Boat Form (indicated by the double arrow) make the Boat Form conformationally disfavored.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Furthermore, the nature of the 1, 4 ring nitrogens, and resulting bond angles, is determined by the nature of the L1 and L3 linkers. For example, both nitrogens are in the sp3 configuration if L1 and L3 are of the (CH2)y type. In this case, the R1 and R3 groups orient as equatorial groups on the<br>
chair configuration and have a high degree of conformational freedom in space due to rotational freedom of C-C single bonds in these groups as shown:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
On the other hand both nitrogens exist in the spz configuration if L1 and L3 have, for example, an initial carbonyl group, such as a linker unit of the -C(=O)-(CH2)y- type. In this instance, the carbonyl groups of the ring nitrogen amide functions necessarily exist in one of two rigid forms, similar to c/s or trans amide forms. This specific orientation of the carbonyl groups in turn restricts the orientatipn of the J and Q groups. Therefore, where L1 and L3 include an initial carbonyl group, the RI and R3groups have conformational orientations that are different from those in compounds without ring nitrogen amide functions, as shown below:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The inventors have surprisingly and unexpectedly found that selective orientation of the R-\ group in compounds of this invention, by the means discussed above, causes a shift or change in efficacy, such as determined by functional activity in an adenyl cyclase cell assay, but without significantly influencing receptor binding affinity. For example, compounds described herein where L1 Is attached to the ring nitrogen through an amide bond are full agonists with intrinsic activity at MC4-R ranging from 80 to 100% (see the compounds of Examples 38, 42,43,44 and 45). However, compounds described herein where L1 is attached through an ethylene group are antagonists or partial agonists with significantly lower intrinsic activity, or have no intrinsic activity, either with or without loss of affinity for MC4-R (see the compounds of Examples 1,2,3, 4, 7 and 8).<br>
The substituents at position 5 and 6 of the piperazine ring also have a significant influence on the orientation of the R1 and R3 groups. For example an R4 group in the general structure of this invention influences the spatial preference of the R3 group, and likewise an R5 group influences the spatial preference of the RI group.  The major influence of these groups on biological activity is seen in a stereo-specific manner. For example, the presence of an R6 substituent, such as methyl or isobutyl, in an (S)-configuration cause severe steric constraint on the J group in compounds where Lt is a -(CH2)y- linker unit. This is because both J as well as the (S)-configuration of the R5 group are positioned in a close chemical space. Steric hindrance between these two groups causes perturbations in the overall orientation of the R! group, resulting in a structure that is less conducive to receptor affinity and functional efficacy of the compounds. Typically, a 5-15 fold loss of MC4-R affinity has been observed. Similarly, in compounds where L, is a -C(=O)-(CH2)y- linker, the incorporation of an (S)-configuration of the Rs group causes the amide carbonyl to position away from the R5 group, again with a similar potential of steric interaction with J group. However, positioning of the L1 carbonyl towards an (S)-configuration of the R5 group is not possible due to severe steric interactions between these groups. These three situations can be shown as:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
By contrast, incorporation of an R6 substituent, such as methyl or isobutyl, in an (R)-configuration positions the RB group away from the R, group.   Since there is no perturbation in the positioning of R1 group, this causes no change in MC4-R receptor affinity and selectivity. These structures are shown as follows:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Incorporation of an R4 substituent, such as methyl or isobutyl in either the (R)- or (S)-configuration at the position 6 of the piperazine ring cause severe steric constraint on the Q group in compounds where L3 includes a carbonyl, such as a -C(=0)-(CH2)y- linker. This is because the spatial orientation of Q Is already influenced by the presence of an R2 group at the position 2 of the piperazine ring. Furthermore, the (S)-configuration R2 and (R)-configuration R4 groups are axially located. These groups have 1,3-diaxial steric interactions that distort the chair conformer of the piperazine ring. The R4 group in its equatorial (S)-configuration form causes severe steric interaction with the carbonyl of the L3 linker, as well as the Q group when L3 is a linker unit such as -(CH2)y-. Therefore, incorporation of an R4 group in either sterochemical orientation leads to compounds that have somewhat weaker receptor affinity (typically a 5-7 fold decrease has been observed). These three situations can be shown as:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
It is evident from the foregoing that the incorporation of R4 and/or RB groups can be employed to modify the functional efficacy of these high-affinity melanocortin compounds. These findings may be used, as described herein, to develop compounds that are agonists, weak partial agonists, mixed agonist-antagonists, antagonists or have no intrinsic activity, and which have utility as agents for modulation of energy homeostasis and feeding responses in mammals.<br>
Steric interaction may be shown by reference to Fig. 1, showing the structure of a hypothetical compound wherein RT and R3 are each phenylacetyl, R2 is (S)-3-aminopropyl, and R5 is (S)-isobutyl (Fig. 1A) or (R)-isobutyl (Fig. 1B). As may be seen from Fig. 1, there is significant steric interaction with (S)-isobutyl (Fig. 1 A) where L1 includes a carbonyl, but not with (R)-isobutyl.<br>
Compounds which bind with high affinity, but which have low or no instrinsic activity, are illustrated by compounds of the following general structure which are disclosed herein.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The initial compound, wherein R5 and R4 are H, is disclosed as Example 129 in PCT/US02/25574, entitled Peptidomimetics of Biologically Active Molecules, filed on August 12, 2002, and incorporated herein by reference. In the foregoing table, intrinsic efficacy or activity less than about 10% is not distinguishable from no intrinsic activity.  Thus, for example, the compound of Example 8 binds with high affinity (4 nM) at MC4-R, but has no intrinsic activity. The compound of Example 8 is accordingly inactive as to MC4-R in terms of agonist/antagonist status with respect to NDP-α-MSH.<br>
Synthetic Schemes. Distinct and separate methods for synthesis of piperazines and ketopiperazines are required. In many synthetic schemes, piperazine molecules as described herein cannot be obtained from ketopiperazine molecules or synthetic schemes as described herein. One obvious limitation to employing ketopiperazine synthetic schemes to synthesize piperazine molecules is that the presence of other reactive groups, such as amide, halogen and aromatic functional groups, can interfere with the process of reducing a ketopiperazine to a piperazine. Thus separate and different methods for the synthesis of piperazines were developed and are disclosed herein. Similarly, separate methods for the synthesis of ketopiperazines were also developed and are disclosed here.<br>
One genera! strategy for either class of compounds includes developing a linear intermediate using chiral building blocks such as amino acid derivatives. The linear intermediate can be cyclized using a Mitsunobo reaction strategy (Mitsunobo, O. The use of dlethyl azodicarboxylate and triphenylphosphine in synthesis and transformation of natural products. Synthesis 1:1-28 (1981)), or by spontaneous cyclization through reactive groups such as a reaction between an amine and an aldehyde functional group or an amine and an ester functional group. In these cyclizations, the driving force for intramolecular reaction versus intermolecular reaction is the thermodynamically favored reaction forming a slx-membered ring structure.<br>
Scheme 4 presented hereafter is an example of a Mitsunobo reaction mediated cyclization. This methodology incorporates conditions that do not involve inversion or racemization of chiral centers, other than inversion of the chiral center on the carbon to which an -OH group is attached.<br>
The methods disclosed herein thus allow for the synthesis of piperazine as well as ketopiperazine molecules with the diverse functionalities disclosed herein. Certain of the schemes further provide a facile approach to obtain compounds that differ at R3 since this group Is introduced after the cyclic intermediate has been synthesized.<br>
The piperazine compounds of the invention have three stereocenters, such that at each of three distinct carbon atoms the molecule can assume any permissible sterochemical configuration, such that eight distinct stereo configurations (2n where n is 3) are both possible and contemplated in this invention. Thus the invention includes compounds with stereo configurations as set forth below (where X is CH2 or C=O). It is further understood that for the R2, R4 and RB positions, as heretofore defined, where a group other than hydrogen is provided for such position, that the position includes such group in one of Rxa or RXb, and hydrogen in the remaining of Rxa or RKb. Thus, for example, R2 may be in either the R2a or R2b position, with the remaining position being hydrogen. In one embodiment, R2a is -(CH2)y-NH-C(=NH)-NH2 and R2b is hydrogen, or vice versa, and so on. It may thus be seen that all possible stereochemical configurations are included within the disclosure of this invention.<br>

Assays and Animal Models.<br>
Selected compounds were tested in assays to determine binding and functional status, and were tested in animal models of penile erection, feeding behavior and conditioned taste avoidance, as discussed below. The following assays and animal models were employed, with modifications as discussed in the examples.<br>
Competitive inhibition assay. A competitive inhibition binding assay was conducted using membranes prepared from hMC3-R, hMC4-R, hMC5-R, and B-16 mouse melanoma cells (containing MC1-R) using 0.4 nM 125l-NDP-α-MSH (New England Nuclear, Boston, MA, USA) in 50 mM HEPES buffer containing 1 mM MgCI2, 2 mM CaCI2, and 5 mM KCI, at pH 7.2. The assay tube also contained a chosen concentration of the test compound of this invention, typically a 1 nM<br>
concentration. for determining its efficacy in inhibiting the binding of 128l-NDP-α-MSH to its receptor. Non-specific binding was measured by complete inhibition of binding of 12SI-NDP-α-MSH in the assay with the presence of 1 pM ct-MSH.<br>
Incubation was for 90 minutes at room temperature, after which the assay mixture was filtered and the membranes washed three times with ice cold buffer. The filter was dried and counted in a gamma counter for remaining radioactivity bound to the membranes. 100% specific binding was defined as the difference in radioactivity (cpm) bound to cell membranes in the absence and presence of 1 µM α-MSH. The cpm obtained in presence of test compounds were normalized with respect to 100% specific binding to determine the percent inhibition of 125l-NDP-α-MSH binding. Each assay was conducted in triplicate and the actual mean values are described, with results less than 0% reported as 0%.<br>
EC50 determination in functional activity assay. The Ki (nM) of certain compounds of the invention were determined. Functional evaluation of compounds at melanocortin receptors was performed by measuring the accumulation of intracellular cAMP in HEK-293 cells expressing MC3-R, MC4-R or MC5-R, and in B-16 mouse melanoma cells (containing MC1-R). Cells, suspended in-Earle's Balanced Salt Solution containing 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5,5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM glutamine, 0.1% albumin and 0.6 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, were plated In 96 well plates at a density of 0.5 x 10s cells per well. Cells were incubated with the test compounds in the presence or absence of α-MSH for 1 hour at 37° C. cAMP levels were measured by EIA (Amersham) in the cell lysates. Data analysis and EC50 values were determined using nonlinear regression analysis with Prism Graph-Pad software.<br>
Functional status. The agonist/antagonist status with respect to MC1-4, MC4-R, and MC5-R of certain compounds ol the invention was determined. Antagonistic activity was determined by measuring the inhibition of α-MSH-induced or NDP-α-MSH-induced cAMP levels following exposure to the compounds as in the preceding descriptions.<br>
Penile erection induction. The ability of compounds to induce penile erection (PE) in male rats were evaluated with selected compounds. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200-250 g were kept on a 12 hour on/off light cycle with food and water ad litltum. All behavioral studies were<br>
performed between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. Groups of 4-8 rats were treated with compounds at a variety of doses via intravenous (IV) or intracerebroventricular (ICV) routes. Immediately after treatment, rats were placed into individual polystyrene cages (27 cm long, 16 cm wide, and 25 cm high) for behavioral observation. Rats were observed for 30 minutes IV or 90 minutes ICV, and the number of yawns, grooming bouts and PEs were recorded in 10-minute bins.<br>
ICV food Intake and body weight change. Change in food intake and body weight was evaluated for selected compounds. Rats with indwelling intracerebroventricular cannulas (ICV rats) were obtained from Hilltop Lab Animals, Inc. (Scottdale, PA). Animals were individually housed in conventional plexiglass hanging cages and maintained on a controlled 12 hour on/12 hour off light cycle.  Water and powdered (LabDiet, 5POO Prolab RMH 3000) or pelleted (Harlan Teklad 2018 18% Protein Rodent Diet) food was provided ad libitum. For 1 week before treatment, 24-hour food intake and body weight change was recorded to assess a baseline for the group during vehicle treatment. The rats were dosed ICV with vehicle or selected compounds (1-3 nmol). The changes in body weight and food intake for the 24 hour period after dosing were determined. The changes in body weight and food intake for the 48 hour period, and in same cases for 72 hours as well, after dosing were also measured to determined reversal of changes in body weight and food intake effect back to baseline.<br>
IV food Intake and body weight change. Change in food intake and body weight was evaluated for selected compounds. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Taconic (Germantown, NY). Animals were individually housed in conventional plexiglass hanging cages and maintained on a controlled 12 hour on/12 hour off light cycle.  Water and powdered (LabDiet, 5POO Prolab RMH 3000) or pelleted (Harlan Teklad 2018 18% Protein Rodent Diet) food was provided ad libitum. For 1 week before treatment, 24-hour food intake and body weight change was recorded to assess a baseline for the group during vehicle treatment. The rats were dosed IV with vehicle or selected compounds (0.5 - 3 mg/kg). The changes in body weight and food intake for the 24 hour period after dosing were determined. The changes in body weight and food intake for the 48 hour period, and in same cases for 72 hours as well, after dosing were also measured to determined reversal of changes in body weight and food intake effect back to baseline.<br>
Behavloral Satiety Sequence. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were maintained on a restricted 20 g powdered food/day schedule. Food was presented at the same time during the lights on period dosed with either saline or the test compound 2 hours before presentation of food and the start of observation. Pre-weighed bowls (containing 20g of food) were presented and the behavior of the rats was observed for 1 hour. Behavioral observations were divided into 3 categories: Feeding, Active (includes grooming, drinking and sniffing/exploration), and Resting (decreased activity and sleep). The amount of time spent in each behavior was recorded. The amount of food intake was determined after the observation period.<br>
Conditioned Taste Avoidance. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were adapted to a restricted drinking period of 30 minutes/day during lights on and were provided with pelleted chow ad libitum. In laboratory animals, administration of LiCI conditions an aversion to the novel and favorable taste of saccharin (Seeley RJ, Blake K, Rushing PA, Benoit S, Eng J, Woods SC and D'Alessio D: The role of CNS glucagons-like peptide-1 (7-36) amide receptors in mediating the visceral illness effects of lithium chloride. J. Neurosci. 20(4):1616-1621,2000). To condition animals, an injection of LiCI or test compound was administered immediately after the initial presentation of a 0.1% solution of saccharin. Two days later, saccharin solution was again presented and fluid intake was determined. A decrease In drinking'the saccharin solution suggests development of a conditioned taste aversion.<br>
