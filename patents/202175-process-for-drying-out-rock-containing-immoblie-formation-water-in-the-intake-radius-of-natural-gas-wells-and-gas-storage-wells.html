				<td>Process for drying out rock containing immobile<br>
formation water in the intake radius of natural gas<br>
wells and gas storage wells<br>
The invention relates to a process for drying out rock containing immobile formation water in the intake radius of natural gas wells and gas storage wells, in which water-repellent active compound in dispersed form renders the water-containing rock hydrophobic.<br>
In the vicinity of production wells in natural gas fields, formation water in the pore cavities of the rock prevents the flow of gas to the production well. If the formation water has a high salt content, the evaporation of water causes the solubility limit to be exceeded, and in particular chloride salts- crystallize out. Since salt water is continuously drawn into the pore cavities by capillary forces, the salt crystals con¬stantly grow until the flow channels are closed to the point of impermeability to natural gas.<br>
Salt deposits occur not only in the pore cavities, but also form on well casings and other pipes, and on storage and further processing facilities, such as piping, valves, heating coils and heating tubes and separators, which are involved with handling the gas produced and the formation water which is separated off. When a deposit forms, the extraction rate decreases and finally the entire operation ceases. Furthermore, the heat transfer is decreased.<br>
The customary process for enhancing the productivity of natural gas wells is the hydraulic generation and stabilization of fractures in the vicinity of the well. The additional drainage areas produced by this means and the high gas flux density in the fractures leads to an elevated production rate of the well. However, this process is highly expensive. Fracture formation can be controlled only to a very restricted extent.<br>
The salt deposits, in particular chloride salts, can be eliminated by flushing with fresh water. Since the<br><br>
salt deposits continue to reform, these flushing operations must be carried out at regular intervals, which causes frequent losses of production.<br>
A process for removing salt deposits in wells is described in US-A-5,051,197 There, the wells are treated with an aqueous composition of aminopolycarboxylic acid and water-soluble organosilane. However, water-soluble organosilanes generally have a high volatility and a low flashpoint, hydrolyze rapidly and release toxic and highly flammable products in the presence of water. Thus, chlorosilanes form HCl, methoxysilanes form methanol and ethoxysilanes form ethanol. Therefore, these compositions can only be kept for a short time and are difficult to handle. In addition, a process for removing salt deposits is described here, and not a process for preventing salt deposits.<br>
A process for preventing salt deposits in wells is described in US-A-3,682,831. There, the wells are treated with water soluble glycol-silicone copolymers which contain SiOC bonds which are highly sensitive to hydrolysis. However, the action of this process is too poor.<br>
The object was therefore to provide a means which drys out immobile formation water in the rock and which provides durable prevention of salt deposits in the pore cavities of the rock in the vicinity of natural gas production wells in natural gas fields.<br>
The invention relates to a process for drying out rock containing immobile formation water in the intake radius of natural gas wells and gas storage wells which deliver less than 50 1 of water per 1000 m (S.T.P.) of natural gas produced, in which a dispersion comprising bhe components<br>
A)   a water-repellent active compound,<br>
B) hydrophilic water-miscible dispersion medium, with or without<br>
2)   a dispersant renders the water-containing rock hydrophobic.<br>
The water-repellent active compounds (A) used<br><br>
according to the invention are readily dispersible in the formation water and can therefore be distributed homogeneously over the entire rock surface and then break there. By this means, the water-repellent active compounds (A) cover the rock surface in a very thin layer.<br>
If natural gas is then produced, decreasing the gas field pressure causes additional uptake of water in the natural gas. Since, in the vicinity of the well, in the rock zone rendered hydrophobic, the capillary action for water is greatly decreased, the treated region gradually dries out by evaporation of the water.<br>
The drying out of the rock improves the gas permeability, since gas can then again flow through the entire pore cavity without hindrance by water. Since, at the same capillary pressure, the water saturation in low-permeability rock having narrow capillaries is greater than in high-permeability rock, the process is particu¬larly suitable for gas fields of low permeability. In addition, in the case of heterogeneous gas field rock having variable permeability, use of the process leads to homogenization of the flow profile in the vicinity of the well.<br>
Drying out the rock in the vicinity of the well prevents blockage of the rock capillaries, and prevents salt deposits on equipment for production, storage and further processing.<br>
The process has significantly lower costs in comparison with hydraulic generation of fractures in the vicinity of the well. The process requires lower injec¬tion pressures and leads to a considerably lower risk of damaging the well. Wells treated by fracture formation can have a supplementary treatment with the process according to the invention. Wells whose equipment is not suitable for hydraulic generation of fractures can also be treated by the process according to the invention.<br>
The dispersion is chemically inert to the rocks and salt solutions present in the gas fields, the natural gas and the production equipment.<br><br>
The water-repellent active compound (A) is preferably soluble to at most 1% by weight, in particular to at most 0.1% by weight, in water at 20°C.<br>
In the process according to the invention, as water-repellent substances (A) , use can be made of, for example, inorganic sxxbstances which have been rendered hydrophobic or unfluorinated or fluorinated waxes, paraffins, carboxylic salts, organic or organosilicon polymeric compounds.<br>
Examples of suitable inorganic substances which have been rendered hydrophobic are pyrogenic and precipi¬tated silicic acid and silicon/aluminum mixed oxides. Said inorganic siibstances can be rendered hydrophobic, for example, by treatment with organosilanes or organo-siloxanes or by etherification of hydroxyl groups to give alkoxy groups. Preference is given to pyrogenic and precipitated silicic acids, since these are readily dispersible.<br>
Suitable waxes are, for example, natural waxes, such as vegetable waxes, e.g. candellila and carnauba wax; animal waxes, e.g. beeswax and lanolin; mineral waxes, e.g. ceresin and ozokerite; chemically modified natural, in particular fluorinated, waxes and synthetic waxes, e.g. polyethylene waxes and silicone waxes.<br>
Suitable carboxylic salts are, in particular, the salts of monobasic or polybasic carboxylic acids having 8 to 50 carbon atoms per carboxyl group. Preference is given to the salts of fluorinated carboxylic acids, in particular when these have a perfluoroalkyl radical having at least 4 carbon atoms. Examples of preferred monobasic fluorinated carboxylic salts are the alkali metal salts of arylcarboxylic acids, such as benzoic acids or naphthoic acids having one or two perfluoroalkyl radicals having preferably 4 to 18 carbon atoms.<br>
Fluorinated organic polymeric compounds which can be used in the process according to the invention are, for example, all compoimds of the type which also have been able to be used or have been used hitherto for rendering organic substances water repellent, such as<br><br>
organic fibers, and inorganic substances. Examples of compounds of this type are polymers which have been prepared from at least partly fluorine-containing monomers, such as polytetrafluoroethylene, copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene and hexafluoropropylene, poly(vinyl fluoride), poly(vinylidene fluoride), polytrifluoro-chloroethylene, copolymers of trifluorochloroethylene and other monomers, such as vinylidene fluoride, vinyl chloride, vinyl acetate, methyl methacrylate or styrene; and fluorinated acrylic resins, such as homopolymers and copolymers of perfluoroalkyl-containing acrylic and methacrylic esters with acrylic acid and methacrylic acid and their derivatives.<br>
Preferred examples of fluorinated acrylic resins are poly(1,1-dihydroperfluorobutyl acrylate) and mixed polymers of n-butyl acrylate, N-methylol acrylamide and at least 35% by weight of 1,1,2, 2-tetrahydroperf luoro-C to C16-alkyl methacrylate having a linear alkyl chain.<br>
Further examples of fluorinated acrylic resins of this type are the alkali metal salts of the copolymers of the above listed acrylates, methacrylates, acrylic acid and methacrylic acid which preferably have a fluorine content of at least 20% by weight.<br>
Other examples of fluorinated organic polymeric compounds are organic synthetic polymers which have been fluorinated after polymerization, such as poly(vinyl chloride), polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(vinyl acetate), poly(vinyl alcohol), polycarbonate, poly-acrylate, polymethacrylate, poly(methyl methacrylate), polystyrene, polyacrylonitrile, poly(vinylidene chloride), poly(vinyl fluoride), poly(vinylidene fluoride), poly(vinylidene cyanide), polybutadiene, polyisoprene, polyethers, polyesters, polyamide, poly-urethane, polyimide, silicones, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyacrylamide, poly(ethylene glycol) and their derivatives which are fluorinated in the side chains or in the main chains. The polymers which have been fluorinated after polymerization preferably have a fluorine content of at least 10% by weight. Particular<br><br>
preference is given to polyurethane resins having a fluorine content of 25 - 35% by weight.<br>
In particular, preference is given as water-repellent active compound (A) to organosilicon compounds, since these are thermally stable at temperatures of 130'C and significantly above which frequently prevail in gas fields. The action on the rock surface rendering it hydrophobic persists for a long period.<br>

The organopolysiloxane resins (A2) are generally not completely miscible with polydimethylsiloxanes.<br>
Although not cited in the general formulae (I) to<br><br>
(Ill) , some of the radicals R can be replaced by hydrogen atoms directly bonded to silicon atoms. However, this is not preferred.<br>

A dispersant, or else mixtures of a plurality of dispersants, can be used.<br>
Dispersants which are particularly preferred are the dispersants listed above under 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8, 12, 13, 15, 16, in particular the dispersants listed under 2, 3, 5, 6 and 13.<br>
PrefereUaly, 2.5 to 2 50, preferably 5 to 150, in particular 10 to 70, parts by weight of dispersant (B) are used per 100 parts by weight of water-repellent active compoiind (A) .<br>
As additives (D) , the dispersion can contain, for exeimple, fillers, fungicides, bactericides, algicides, biocides, odorants, corrosion inhibitors, native oils, thickeners, crosslinking agents, cosurfactants and organic solvents.<br>
The dispersions may contain small amounts of organic solvents depending on the preparation method. In particular in the case of the preparation of organo-polysiloxane resins, organic solvents or native oils are frequently used. If the dispersion contains organic solvents, their content is preferably at most 50 parts by weight, in particular 5 to 2 0 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of water-repellent active compound (A) .<br><br>
The content of filler is preferably up to 20 parts by weight, in particular 2 to 8 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of water-repellent active compound , (A) .<br>
The preparation of the dispersions is known to those skilled in the art.<br>
For the ready-to-use dispersion, the sum of the<br>
components water-repellent substances (A), dispersion<br>
medium (B), dispersants (C) and, if appropriate,<br>
additives (D) is preferably 0.01 to 25% by weight,<br>

particular 0.1 to 2% by weight, based on the weight of<br>
the dispersion used.<br>
'j	The mean particle size of the dispersion is<br>
preferably at most 1000 /xm, in particular 5 nm to 250 [oa..<br>
The compositions, particle sizes and concentrations of the dispersions can be matched to the types of rock and conditions, such as temperature and salt content, prevailing in the gas fields, so that the dispersions are injectable even under extreme conditions. The particle size is preferably selected in such a manner that the pore size of the rock is not reached. By means of the high content of the components water-repellent substances (A) , dispersion medium (B), dispersant (C) and, if appropriate, additives (D) in the dispersion, the dispersion medium introduced into the rock can be kept small. The concentration of the dispersion can be matched to rock properties, such as permeability and depth of penetration. In the case of high permeabilities, smaller amounts of more coarsely disperse dispersions having higher contents of the components water-repellent substances (A) , dispersion medium (B) , dispersant (C) and, if appropriate, additives (D) can be used. In the case of low rock permeabilities, greater ctmounts of finely dispersed dispersions having lower concentration are used.<br>
Substances are also suitable which do not form a water-repellent siibstance (A) in a dispersion medium (B) in which they were previously soluble until use condi-<br><br>
tions are achieved.' Examples of these which may be mentioned are nonionic surfactants or glycol-functional siUcone oils, which are soluble in polar dispersion media such as water, but then, at elevated temperatures, reach a cloud point and become water-repellent.<br>
The water present in the natural gas is principally condensation water. Preferably, the natural gas wells and gas-storage wells treated by the present process deliver at most 40, in particular at most 20, L of water per lOOOm (S.T.P) of natural gas produced.<br>

Accordingly the present invention relates to a process for drying out immobile formation water in rock in the intake radius of natural gas wells and gas storage well which deliver less than 50 1 of water per 1000 m (S.T.P) of natural gas produced, comprising the step of contacting said rock with a dispersion comprising the components:<br>
A)	an organosilicon compound as water-repellent active compound<br>
B)	water as dispersion medium and optionally<br>
C)	a dispersant for rendering the water-containing rock hydrophobic<br>
Examples.<br>
The examples below were carried out on sample cores of the middle mottled sandstone of the gas field in Barrien, northern Germany.    The cylindrical sample cores had lengths and diameters of 3 cm each. Examples 1 to 5<br>
The following measures were carried out with the sample cores :<br>
(a)	the sample cores were dried overnight at 90°C.<br>
(b)	The dry sample cores were placed in a vacuum-tight container and the container was evacuated. When vacuum was reached, the container was isolated fi-om the vacuum pump by closing a valve and dem. Water was dravm into the container via a second<br><br>
connection. After the sample cores were completely immersed in dem. water, the container was vented. The sample cores were weighed to determine m.<br>
c)	The sample cores were dried overnight at 90°C and then weighed to determine m.<br>
d)	The dry sample cores were each rolled up in one absorbent filter paper strip of width 7 cm and length 19.2 cm in such a manner that the core was wrapped round twice and the paper projected approximately 4 cm on one side. The filter paper was pressed onto the cylinder surface by an elastic latex txjbe. In an environment saturated with water vapor, the projecting paper was placed in dem. water in such a manner that the end of the paper dipped into the water, but the core was situated above the water surface. After seven hours, the core was unwrapped and weighed to determine mj.<br>
e)	Using the equation<br><br>
the reference value for dem. water having spontane¬ous imbibition SwCsp) was calculated. The spon¬taneous imbibition describes the displacement of the non-wetting phase by the wetting phase.<br>
f)	The ssLoaple cores were dried overnight at 90°C.<br>
g)	In a similar manner to measure b) , the seunple cores were impregnated with organopolysiloxane dispersion which contained organopolysiloxanes (A) as active compoxind for rendering hydrophobic in a 10% strength concentration. To remove excess dispersion, the cores were blasted with nitrogen.<br>
h) The sample cores were dried for 17 h at 9 0°C and weighed to determine m.<br>
i) In a similar manner to measure d) , the dry sample cores were wrapped in filter paper strips and placed in dem. water. After seven hours, the core was unwrapped and weighed to determine mp2«<br><br>
j )   Using the eqpiation<br><br>
the spontaneous imbibition SwCsp) after treatment<br>
of the cores with dispersion was calculated, k)   The sample cores were dried again at 90°C. Measures<br>
i) and j) were carried out again. The procedure was<br>
repeated several times.<br>
The 5 organopolysiloxane dispersions below were studied in Examples 1 to 5<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The  spontaneous  imbibition  Sw(sp)j  decreases<br>
sharply after 1 to 2 days in the case of the cores<br>
treated with organopolysiloxane dispersion, since render-<br>
" ing the cores hydrophobic greatly decreases the capillary<br>
action for water.<br>
In Table II below, the values for the spontaneous imbibition Sw(sp)i after different drying times are given as the sum of the drying times in measures h) and k) in<br><br>
The spontaneous imbibition Sw(sp)„£ of a sample core was determined in a similar manner to Example 1 by measures a) to f). Subsequently, the measures below were carried out:<br>
1) The sample core was impregnated with salt water in a similar manner to measure b) . The salt water roughly corresponds in salt content to the formation water and contains, per liter, 28.5 g of NaCl, 18.5 g of CaClj, 1.6 g of MgClj and 1.4 g of KCl, in total, 5% salt content, m) The sample core impregnated with salt water was flooded at 140"C with the organopolysiloxane dispersion from Example 5 at a rate of 10 ml/h up to constant pressure. About 3 to 4 pore volumes of<br><br>
organopolysiloxane dispersion were used in the<br>
course of this treatment.<br>
n)   The sample core was kept at 140°C for 3 days.<br>
/ o)   The organopolysiloxane dispersion was flushed out of<br>
the sample core with salt water. The salt water was<br>
then displaced with nitrogen.<br>
p)   The sample cores were dried by slowly redu9i'ng lihe<br>
/'   ,  * pressure  from  0.44  to  0.1  MPa  in 6     h/ aijdd.<br>
i	/<br>
subsequently keeping them for 17 hours at 90"C and were weighed to determine SLJ.<br>
g) In a similar manner to measure d) , the dry sample cores were wrapped in filter paper strips and placed in salt water. After seven hours, the core was \inwrapped and weighed to determine mp3.<br>
r)   Using the equation<br><br>
the spontaneous imbibition Sw(sp)2 was calculated, s)   The sample cores were dried again for 17 h at 90°C.<br>
Measures g) and r) were carried out again. The<br>
process was repeated several times.<br>
Table III below gives the values for the spontaneous imbibition Swtsp) after different drying times as the sum of the drying times in measures p) and<br><br>
The spontaneous imbibition with salt water Sw(sp)2 also decreases sharply after storage at high<br><br>
temperatures in the case of the cores treated with organopolysiloxane dispersion. The capillary action of the salt water is greatly decreased under conditions which prevail in natural gas fields.<br><br><br>
