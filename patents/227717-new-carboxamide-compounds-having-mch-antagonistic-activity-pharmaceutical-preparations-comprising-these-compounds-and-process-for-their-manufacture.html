				<td>New carboxamide compounds having MCH-antagonistic activity, pharmaceutical preparations comprising these compounds and process<br>
for their manufacture<br>
The present invention relates to new carboxamide compounds, processes for preparing them and the physiologically acceptable salts thereof as well as their use as MCH antagonists and their use in preparing a pharmaceutical preparation which is suitable for the prevention and/or treatment of symptoms and/or diseases caused by MCH or causally connected with MCH in some other way. The invention further relates to the use of a compound according to the invention for influencing eating behaviour and for reducing body weight and/or for preventing an increase in the body weight of a mammal. The invention also relates to compositions and medicaments containing a compound according to the invention, and a process for preparing them.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
The intake of food and its conversion in the body is an essential part of life for all living creatures. Therefore, deviations in the intake and conversion of food generally lead to problems and also illness. The changes in the lifestyle and nutrition of humans, particularly in industrialised countries, have promoted obesity in recent decades. In affected people, obesity leads directly to restricted mobility and a reduction in the quality of life. There is the additional factor that obesity often leads to other diseases such as, for example, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, high blood pressure, arteriosclerosis and coronary heart disease. Moreover, high body weight alone puts an increased strain on the support and mobility apparatus, which can lead to chronic pain and diseases such as arthritis or osteoarthritis. Thus, obesity is a serious health problem for society.<br>
The term obesity means an excess of adipose tissue. In this connection, obesity is fundamentally to be seen as the increased level of fatness which<br><br>
leads to a health risk. In the last analysis it is not precisely possible to draw a distinction between normal individuals and those suffering from obesity, but the health risk accompanying obesity is presumed to rise continuously as the level of fatness increases. For simplicity's sake, in the present invention, individuals with a Body Mass Index (BMI), which is defined as the body weight measured in kilograms divided by the height (in metres) squared, above a value of 25 and more particularly above 30 are preferably regarded as suffering from obesity.<br>
Apart from physical activity and a change in nutrition, there is currently no convincing treatment option for effectively reducing body weight. However, as obesity is a major risk factor in the development of serious and even life-threatening diseases, it is all the more important to have access to pharmaceutical active substances for the prevention and/or treatment of obesity. One approach which has been proposed very recently is the therapeutic use of MCH antagonists (cf. inter alia WO 01/21577, WO 01/82925).<br>
Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a cyclic neuropeptide consisting of 19 amino acids. It is synthesised predominantly in the hypothalamus in mammals and from there travels to other parts of the brain by the projections of hypothalamic neurones. Its biological activity is mediated in humans through two different glycoprotein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) from the family of rhodopsin-related GPCRs, namely the MCH receptors 1 and 2 (MCH-1R, MCH-2R).<br>
Investigations into the function of MCH in animal models have provided good indications for a role of the peptide in regulating the energy balance, i.e. changing metabolic activity and food intake [1,2]. For example, after intraventricular administration of MCH in rats, food intake was increased compared with control animals. Additionally, transgenic rats which produce more MCH than control animals, when given a high-fat diet, responded by gaining significantly more weight than animals without an experimentally altered MCH level. It was also found that there is a positive correlation<br><br>
between phases of increased desire for food and the quantity of MCH mRNA in the hypothalamus of rats. However, experiments with MCH knock-out mice are particularly important in showing the function of MCH. Loss of the neuropeptide results in lean animals with a reduced fat mass, which take in significantly less food than control animals.<br>
The anorectic effects of MCH are mediated in rodents through the Gs-coupled MCH-1R [3-6]. Unlike primates, ferrets and dogs, no second receptor has hitherto been found in rodents. After losing the MCH-1 R, knock-out mice have a lower fat mass, an increased energy conversion and, when fed on a high fat diet, do not put on weight, compared with control animals. Another indication of the importance of the MCH-MCH-1R system in regulating the energy balance results from experiments with a receptor antagonist (SNAP-7941) [3]. In long term trials the animals treated with the antagonist lose significant amounts of weight.<br>
In addition to its anorectic effect, the MCH-1 R antagonist SNAP-7941 also achieves additional anxiolytic and antidepressant effects in behavioural experiments on rats [3]. Thus, there are clear indications that the MCH-MCH-1R system is involved not only in regulating the energy balance but also in affectivity.<br>

The compounds according to the invention may be obtained using methods of synthesis which are known in principle. Preferably the compounds are obtained by the method of preparation described above and explained more fully hereinafter.<br>
The method of preparation according to the invention to obtain the first group of the preferred embodiments, i.e. those compounds in which the group A and the group R3 are not directly linked to one another, basically distinguishes between two cases.<br>
The first case covers those compounds of formula I wherein the group A denotes a nitrogen-heterocyclic group connected via a nitrogen atom to the carboxamide group, which may comprise in addition to the nitrogen atom one or more heteroatoms selected from N, O and S. The reaction of the amine of formula 1-1 with the secondary amine of formula I-2 is illustrated in the following general reaction plan:<br><br>
Reaction plan 1:<br>
(Formula Remvoed)<br>
Preferably the amine compound of formula 1-1 is first reacted with CDT (1,1-carbonyldi-(1,2,4-triazole)) in a solvent or mixture of solvents and then the reaction mixture is further reacted with the amine compound of formula I-2, while the minimum of one base is added to the reaction mixture before and/or after the reaction of the amine compound with CDT.

(Formula Remvoed)<br>
The second case of preparation processes covers the other compounds of formula I which are not covered by case 1, wherein the group A is not directly linked to R3. The reaction of the carboxylic acid compound of formula I-3 with TBTU (2-(1 H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium-tetrafluoroborate) and the amine compound of formula 1-1 in a solvent or mixture of solvents in the presence of at least one base is shown in reaction plan 3.<br>

(Formula Remvoed)<br>
Preferably the carboxylic acid compound of formula 1-3 is reacted with TBTU in a solvent or mixture of solvents and then the reaction mixture is further reacted with the amine compound of formula 1-1, while the minimum of one base is added to the reaction mixture before and/or after the reaction of the carboxylic acid compound with TBTU. Instead of a carboxylic acid it is also possible to use the corresponding activated carboxylic acid derivatives, such as for example esters, ortho-esters, carboxylic acid chlorides or anhydrides. Preferably the base used is a nitrogen base, particularly a tert-amine, such as for example triethylamine. Advantageously the carboxylic acid compound of formula I-3 is reacted with TBTU and then this reaction mixture is used with the amine compound of formula 1-1 in a temperature range of 0°C to 60°C in a molar ratio of the carboxylic acid compound of formula I-3 : amine compound of formula 1-1 : TBTU : base of 1 ± 0.25 : 1 ± 0.25 : 1 ± 0.25 : 1 to 4.<br>

The method of preparation according to the invention for the second group of preferred embodiments, i.e. those compounds wherein the group A and the group R3 are joined together, distinguishes between seven cases, depending on the meanings Illa to Illg of the group Q.<br>

Reaction plan 4:<br>
 (Formula Remvoed)<br>
Preferably the o-bromomethyl-benzoic acid ester derivative of formula la.2 is reacted with the amine compound of formula la.1 in a solvent or mixture of solvents, while at least one base is added. Instead of an o-bromomethyl-benzoic acid ester derivative of formula la.2 other corresponding o-benzyl-benzoic acid ester derivatives (iodine or mesylate instead of bromine) may also be used. Preferably potassium carbonate or caesium carbonate is used as base, but tert. amine bases such as triethylamine are also common. Advantageously the o-bromomethyl-benzoic acid ester derivative of formula la.2 is used in acetonitrile with the amine of formula la.1 and with potassium carbonate as base in a temperature range of 40-80°C in a molar ratio of the o-bromomethyl-benzoic acid ester derivative of formula la.2 : amine of formula la.1 : potassium carbonate of 1+0.25 : 1+0.25 : 3+0,50.<br>

compound of formula lb.4 to form an isoquinoline derivative of formula lb.5, which is further derivatised by known methods to obtain the compound of formula I. The isoquinolinone derivative of formula lb.3 is obtainable from cinnamic acid derivatives of formula lb.1 by reaction with (EtO)2P(O)N3. The synthesis of the base substance was described by M. Becker et al. in Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry Letters 9 (1999), 2753-2758. The reaction is illustrated in the following reaction plan 5, in which in the interests of clarity the substituents L1, L2, L3 on the phenyl ring have been omitted.<br>
Reaction plan 5:<br><br>
(Formula Remvoed)<br>
A compound of formula lb.2 is advantageously obtained by the reaction sequence described hereinafter. The acrylic acid derivative lb.1 is first reacted by the action of chlorinating agents such as thionyl chloride, phosphorus pentachloride or oxalyl chloride without or optionally in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane to obtain the acid chloride at temperatures between 0 °C and 80 °C. This is converted by the action of sodium azide in a solvent or mixture of solvents into the acrylic acid azide derivative. The solvents used may be for example dioxane, tetrahydrofuran or water. Preferably the isocyanate derivative lb.2 is synthesised directly by the action of phosphoric acid diphenylester azide on the acrylic acid derivative lb.1 in the presence of a base in a solvent at temperatures between 0°C and 150°C . Suitable solvents include for example toluene or dioxane. Tertiary amines such as for example triethylamine may be used as bases. The above reactions have reaction times of between one and twelve hours. Advantageously the reaction of the acrylic acid derivative lb.1 with phosphoric acid diphenylester azide and triethylamine in a molar ratio of 1+0.25 : 1+0.25 : 1+0.25 takes place in toluene as solvent. The isocyanate derivative lb.2 is heated in a solvent optionally in the presence of a base such as for example tributylamine and forms the isoquinolone derivative of formula lb.3. Preferably the reaction takes place in diphenylether in the region of the melting point. Heat sources which may be used are oil, metal baths or a microwave.<br>
The reaction of the isoquinolone derivative of formula lb.3 with the mesylate derivative of formula lb.4 to form the isoquinolone derivative of formula lb.5 is carried out in a solvent in the presence of a base at temperatures between 0°C and 150°C. Advantageously the reaction of the isoquinolone derivative lb.3 with the mesylate derivative of formula lb.4 and sodium hydride in a molar ratio of 1+0.25 : 1+0.25 : 1+0.25 takes place in DMF as solvent. The isoquinolone derivative of formula lb.5 is first reacted in a solvent in the presence of an acid, in order to convert the acetal into the corresponding aldehyde. This is converted into a compound of formula Ib in the presence of a hybrid converter, an amine and an acid in a solvent. Examples of hybrid converters include for example sodium triacetoxyborohydride, sodium borohydride and sodium cyanoborohydride. Advantageously the reaction of<br><br>
the aldehydes, liberated from the isoquinolone derivative lb.5, with an amine and sodium cyanoborohydride in a molar ratio of 1+0.25 : 1+0.25 : 0.8+0.25 takes place in methanol and acetic acid at temperatures of around 20 °C.<br>

According to the third case in which Q denotes -N=CR8- (Illc), a phthalazinone derivative of formula lc.4 is reacted with an electrophilic compound of formula lc.5 to form a phthalazinone derivative of formula lc.6, which is further derivatised by known methods to form the compound of formula Ic. The phthalazinone derivative of formula lc.4 for R8= hydrogen is obtainable starting from the phenyloxazole derivative of formula lc.1 by acylation to form an o-oxazolyl-benzaldehyde derivative of formula lc.2 and subsequent cyclisation to form a 3-hydroxy-3H-isobenzofuran-1-one derivative of formula lc.3. The synthesis of the base substance was described by M. Napoletano et al., Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry Letters 12 (2002), 5-8. The reaction to form compounds of general formula Ic is illustrated in the following reaction plan 7, in which in the interests of clarity the substituents L1, L2, L3 on the phenyl ring have been omitted.<br>
Reaction plan 7:<br>
(Formula Remvoed)<br>
The above reaction sequence is described in more detail hereinafter: The oxazoline derivative lc.1 is metallised using a suitable organometallic reagent and then reacted with a formaldehyde equivalent such as for example dimethylformamide or an orthoformate at temperatures between -70 °C and 20 °C, preferably at temperatures between -20 °C and 0 °C, to form a compound of formula lc.2. Suitable solvents include for example dioxane, tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether. By the action of aqueous sulphuric acid in a solvent such as for example ethanol at a temperature close to the boiling point of the solvent or mixture of solvents over a period of one to 24 hours, a compound of general formula lc.3 may be obtained. The phthalazinone derivative of formula lc.4 may be obtained by reacting a compound of formula lc.3 with hydrazine in acetic acid and optionally in a solvent at temperatures in range between 20 and 120 degrees celsius. The synthesis to obtain the phthalazinone derivative of formula Ic is carried out analogously to the reactions as described for the synthesis of a compound of general formula Ib.<br>
The synthesis of phthalazinone derivatives of formula Ic, particularly the starting compounds and the subsequent derivatisation, will now be illustrated with reference to a plan of synthesis 8 of a specific compound in which the abbreviations have the following meanings: LAH denotes lithium aluminium hydride, BuLi denotes n-butyllithium, DMF denotes dimethylformamide, MeOH is methanol and Ms-CI is methanesulphonic acid chloride.<br>

The reaction is illustrated in the following reaction plan 9, in which in the interests of clarity the substituents L1, L2, L3 on the phenyl ring have been omitted.<br>
Reaction plan 9:<br><br>

Preferably a compound of general formula ld.1 is reacted in a solvent such as for example methanol in the presence of an inorganic acid, for example hydrochloric acid, and a salt containing the nitrite ion at a temperature between -10 °C and 30 °C. Advantageously the reaction of the amino compound ld.1 with sodium nitrite in a molar ratio of 1+0.25 : 1,5+0.25 takes place in methanol as solvent and in the presence of hydrochloric acid.<br>
According to the fifth case, in which Q denotes -CO-NR9- (Ille), an o-amino-benzamide derivative of formula le.1 is reacted in the presence of CDI to form a quinazolinedione derivative of formula le.

The reaction is stirred for 30 min to 2 h between ambient temperature and 40°C, before semisaturated NaHCO3 solution is added. After extraction of the aqueous phase with a suitable solvent (e.g. ethyl acetate) the organic phase is dried<br><br>
over magnesium sulphate. The solvent is removed using the rotary evaporator; further purification is carried out by column chromatography or HPLC. The reaction may also be carried out in a Chemspeed automatic synthesiser.<br>

20 mL thionyl chloride and 1 mL DMF are added dropwise to 9.31 g (40mmol) of 4'-chloro-biphenyl-4-carboxylic acid. The reaction mixture is heated to 60°C for 2 h. Then the excess thionyl chloride is eliminated in vacuo at 50°C and the residue is taken up in 200 mL CH2CI2. This solution is added dropwise to 9.19 g (40 mmol) of ethyl 4-(2-amino-ethyl)-benzoate, used as the hydrochloride, in 100 mL of 10% aqueous Na2CO3 solution and the reaction mixture is stirred for a further hour at RT. After the addition of water and CH2CI2 the organic phase is separated off, the aqueous phase is extracted with CH2CI2, the combined organic phases are washed with semisaturated NaHCOs solution and water and dried over MgSO4. After elimination of the drying agent the solution is filtered through activated charcoal, evaporated down in vacuo and the residue recrystallised from tert-butylmethylether.

Some test methods for determining an MCH-receptor antagonistic activity will now be described. In addition, other test methods known to the skilled man are used, e.g. by inhibiting the MCH-receptor-mediated inhibition of cAMP production, as described by Hoogduijn M et al. in "Melanin-concentrating hormone and its receptor are expressed and functional in human skin", Biochem. Biophys. Res Commun. 296 (2002) 698-701 and by biosensory measurement of the binding of MCH to the MCH receptor in the presence of antagonistic substances by plasmon resonance, as described by Karlsson OP and Lofas S. in "Flow-Mediated On-Surface Reconstitution of G-Protein Coupled Receptors for Applications in Surface Plasmon Resonance Biosensors", Anal. Biochem. 300 (2002), 132-138. Other methods of testing antagonistic activity to MCH receptors are contained in the references and patent documents mentioned hereinbefore, and the description of the test methods used is hereby incorporated in this application.<br>
MCH-1 receptor binding test<br>
Method:	MCH binding to hMCH-1 R transfected cells<br>
Species:	Human<br>
Test cell:	hMCH-1 R stably transfected into CHO/Galpha16 cells<br>
Results:	IC50 values<br>
Membranes from CHO/Galpha16 cells stably transfected with human hMCH-1R are resuspended using a syringe (needle 0.6 x 25 mm) and diluted in test buffer (50 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCI2, 2 mM EGTA, pH 7.00; 0.1 % bovine serum albumin (protease-free), 0.021 % bacitracin, 1 ug/ml aprotinin, 1 ug/ml leupeptin and 1 µM phosphoramidone) to a concentration of 5 to 15 ug/ml. 200 microlitres of this membrane fraction (contains 1 to 3 µg of protein) are incubated for 60 minutes at ambient temperature with 100 pM of 125l-tyrosyl melanin concentrating hormone (125I-MCH commercially obtainable from MEN) and increasing concentrations of the test compound in a final volume of 250 microlitres. After the incubation the reaction is filtered using a cell harvester through 0.5% PEI treated glass fibre filters (GF/B, Unifilter Packard). The membrane-bound radioactivity retained on the filter is then determined after the addition of scintillator substance (Packard Microscint 20) in a measuring device (TopCount of Packard).<br>
The non-specific binding is defined as bound radioactivity in the presence of 1<br>
micromolar MCH during the incubation period.<br>
The analysis of the concentration binding curve is carried out on the<br>
assumption of one receptor binding site.<br>
Standard:<br>
Non-labelled MCH competes with labelled 125I-MCH for the receptor binding<br>
with an IC50 value of between 0.06 and 0.15 nM.<br>
The KD value of the radioligand is 0.156 nM.<br>

Clonal CHO/Galpha16 hMCH-R1 cells are cultivated in Ham's F12 cell culture medium (with L-glutamine; BioWhittaker; Cat.No.: BE12-615F). This contains per 500 ml 10% PCS, 1% PENStrep, 5 ml L-glutamine (200 mM stock solution), 3 ml hygromycin B (50 mg/ml in PBS) and 1.25 ml zeocin (100 µg/ml stock solution). One day before the experiment the cells are plated on a 384-well microtitre plate (black-walled with a transparent base, made by Costar) in a density of 2500 cells per cavity and cultivated in the above medium overnight at 37°C, 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity. On the day of the experiment the cells are incubated with cell culture medium to which 2 mM Fluo-4 and 4.6 mM Probenicid have been added, at 37°C for 45 minutes. After charging with fluorescent dye the cells are washed four times with Hanks buffer solution (1 x HBSS, 20 mM HEPES), which is combined with 0.07% Probenicid. The test substances are diluted in Hanks buffer solution, combined with 2.5% DMSO. The background fluorescence of non-stimulated cells is measured in the presence of substance in the 384-well microtitre plate five minutes after the last washing step in the FLIPR384 apparatus (Molecular Devices; excitation wavelength: 488 nm; emission wavelength: bandpass 510 to 570 nm). To stimulate the cells MCH is diluted in Hanks buffer with 0.1% BSA, pipetted into the 384-well cell culture plate 35 minutes after the last washing step and the MCH-stimulated fluorescence is then measured in the FLIPR384 apparatus.<br>
Data analysis:<br>
1st measurement: The cellular Ca2+ mobilisation is measured as the peak of the relative fluorescence minus the background and is expressed as the percentage of the maximum signal of the reference (MCH 10"6M). This measurement serves to identify any possible agonistic effect of a test substance.<br>
2nd measurement: The cellular Ca2+ mobilisation is measured as the peak of the relative fluorescence minus the background and is expressed as the percentage of the maximum signal of the reference (MCH 10-6M, signal is standardised to 100%). The EC50 values of the MCH dosage activity curve with and without test substance (defined concentration) are determined<br>
graphically by the GraphPad Prism 2.01 curve program. MCH antagonists cause the MCH stimulation curve to shift to the right in the graph plotted.<br>
The inhibition is expressed as a pKB value:<br>
pKB=log(EC50(testsubstance+MCH) / EC50(MCH) -1 ) -log C(testsubstance)<br>
The compounds according to the invention, including their salts, exhibit an MCH-receptor antagonistic activity in the tests mentioned above. Using the MCH-1 receptor binding test described above an antagonistic activity is obtained in a dosage range from about 10-10 to 10-5 M, particularly from 10-9 to 10-6M.<br>
