				<td>This invention rektes to substituted benzoxazinone compounds, and associated compositions, methods for use as therapeutic agents, and methods of preparation<br>
thereof.<br>
The actions of tiie neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) as a major modulatory neurotransmitter in the brain, are mediated through, a number of receptor &amp;milies termed 5-HTl, 5-HT2,5- HT3,5-HT4, 5-HT5, S-HTS, and 5-HT7. Based on a high level of 5-HT6 receptor mRNA in the brain, it has been stated that the 5-HT6 receptor may play a role in tiie pathology and treatment of central nerve system disorders. In particular, 5-HT6 sdedive ligands have been identified as potentially useful in the treatment of certain CNS disorders such as Parkinson"s disease, Huntington"s disease, anxiety, depression, manic depression, psydioses, epilepsy, obsessive compxitsive disorders, migraine, Alzheimer"s disease (enhancement of cognitive memory), sleep disorders, feeding disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, panic attacks, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), attention deficit disorder (ADD), withdrawal from drug abuse such as cocaine, ethanol, nicotine and benzodiazepines, schizophrenia, and also disorders associated with spinal trauma and/or head injury such as hydrocephalus. Sudi compounds are also expected to be of use in the treatment of certain gastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as functional bowel disorda:. See for example, BX. Roth et al., /. Pharmacol £xp. Ther., 1994,268&gt; pages 1403-14120, D. R. Sibley et al., Mot Pharmacol, 1993,43,320-327, A.J. Sleight et al.. Neurotransmission, 1995,11,1-5, and A. J. Sleight et al.. Serotonin ID Research Alert, 1997,2(3), 115-8.<br>
While some 5-HT6 modulators have been disclosed, there continues to be a need for compounds that are useful for modulating 5-HT6.<br>

Specific examples of the procedure of Scheme A are provided in the following Experimental section.<br><br>
SCHEME A<br>
Numerous synthetic routes to partially hydrogenated quinolinones are known and ii^y be nsed in preparation of the subject compounds, The synthesis in Steps 1 and 2 of Scheme A represents the procedure r^orted by Paviaetal.., 7- Org. Chem. (1990)VDL<br><br>
55(2), pp. 560-564. Briefly, in Step 1 an orttoQitrobenzaldeliyde ais alkylated via an aJdol reaction with a carbethozyalkylene triplienylpliospiioraDe (not s}iO"wn) or like agent to provide an aldol condensaticm prodnctb. Various nitro- substituted benzaldehydes usable in this step are commerdaHy available or can be prepared via well known techniques. For example, nitrobenzoic adds maybe reduced to the corresponding benzyl alcohol using borane or like reducing agent, and the benzyl alcohol then selectivdy oxidized to the corresponding benzaldehyde via pyridinium dilorochromate reduction as reported by Pavia et al., supra.<br>
In Step 2, a cydization of aldol condensation product ^ Tinder reducing conditions yidds quinobnone£. This cydization maybe achieved, for ejcample, by hydrogenation in die presence of platinum catalyst<br>
In Step 3, an N-aJkyiation is carried out by treatment of quinoHnone c with strong" base, such as a metal hydride under polar aprotic conditions, foDowed by esposure to alkylating agent d to provide an N-aliijdated quinolinone e. The leaving groups G of alkylating agent d, whidi maybe the same or different, are preferably bromo or other halo.<br>
A cross-coupling amination reaction may then be utilized in Step 4 in wiiich. the N-alkyiated guinolinonee of Step 3 istreated with a heteroq"dic amine fin the presence of a palladium catalyst to displace leaving group G and yield a heterocydyl-substituted quinolinone YQ. This cross-coupling reaction may be adiieved via heating under uonpolar solvent conditions. Where R"" is hydrogen, BOC protection or other removable protection strategies may be used to protect fhe exposed nitrogen of heterocyclic amine f.<br>
The substituted quinolinone VH produced in Step 4 represents a spedfic embodiment of compounds of formula I, discussed above, wherein X is —CH2-, Y is -OHR^-i n is 1, p is 1, A is optionally substituted phenylene, and E is N.<br>
Numerous variations on the procedure of Steps 1-4 are possible and may be tised to provide various compounds of formula 1. One such variation useful for prepaxation of quinolinones wherein R^ is sensitive to or incompatible with the reducing conditions of step 2, involves reaction of the orthonitrobenzaldehyde a with "Meldrum"s ester" in die presence of trieth)4anmie and formic add to produce an aldol condensation product (not shown). The aldol condensation product can then be esterified and subject to cydization<br><br>
by iieating in the presence of sodium dithionate to provide qmnolinone c. This particular procedure is described in Synthetic Communications-, Vol. 25 p. 3067 (1995).<br>
In anQther variatioii, aUcjiatmg agent d used in the alkyiation of Step 3 may comprise a a-haloallcfl uaphdiji compound, a-IiaIoalkyIbiph.en7l compound, a-haloalkjdethyienedioxyphenjd compound, or other a-haloalkyiar^ compound. In other embodiments Step 3 may be canied out using a-haloalkyl heteroaryl compounds such as a-haloalfcjdpyridines, a-haloalkyithiophenes, a-haloalkjiindoles, a-haloalkyiethyienedioxyphenTi compounds, and the like. In the case of a-haloalkyi heteroaiTd compounds, iuitable protection group strate^es maybe employed to avoid unwantai heteroatom aJkjdation during tiiis step.<br>
In certain embodiments, heterocydic amine f may be a piperazine of the formula:<br><br>
(i.e., q and r each are equal to 2), such that the compound of formula I| is of formula Ig discussed above, witii R^ shown as hydrogen. Many substituted piperazines of this sort, including N-meth"jd piperazine and 3,5-dimeth.7ipiperaziQe for esample, are commercially available or prepared by wdl Icoown techniques and may be used in the procedure of Scheme A.<br>
In other embodiments of the invention, Step 4 maybe omitted and Steps 5-7 carried out in place thereof. In Step 5, the N-alltylated quinolinone e prepared in Step 3 is litbiated via treatment with an aDqditbium reagent to provide a lithiated quinolinone g.<br>
An alfcyiation may then b e carried out in Step 6 by reaction of lithiated quinolinone<br>
f mth a heterocyclyl ketone h to effect formation of compound j. Heterocyclyi ketone h<br>
may comprise, for KSample, an optionally substituted piperidinone or an optionally<br>
substituted pyrrolidinone, both of "wiudi are commercially available or can be prepared<br>
by well-knovm techniques. Where R^° is hydrogen, a BOC, allyl or o^er protection<br>
group may b e used to protect the nitrogen heteroatom of ketone \.	-"<br><br>
Compound i may in turn be dehydrated in Step 7 and then optionally subject to reduction to proTide qumolinone derivatiye ^ In certain embodiments, dehydration of compound j may occur spontaneously. Quinolinone derivatiye ^ represents a specific embodiment of compounds of formula I wherein, wherein X is -CHr-, Y is -(CR.^R^)n-wifh n being 1 and R^ being hydrogen, p is I, A is optionally substituted phenylene, and E isCH.<br>

A cyclization is then carried out in Step 2 to provide a benzozazinone compound m<br>
from the aminophenol x generated in Step 1. Where n is 1, for exaroplej the<br>
benzoxazinone m is a 2H-l,4-ben2oxa2in-3(4iH)-one, and where n is 2 the compound m<br>
is a 2,3~Dih7dro-l,5-benzoxazepin-4(5H)-one. TTie cydization maybe achieved by<br>
reaction of the aminophenol j vrith a 2-halQ add halide 1 (G is halo) such as chloroacetfl<br>
ciiloride (to provide n= I and R^, R* as hydrogen), 2-chloropropionyi chioride (which<br>
provides n = 1, R^ as meth"ji and R* as hydrogen), 3-chloTOpropionyl chloride (providing<br>
n = 2 and R", R* as hydrogen), 2-chloroisobutyryL chloride (providing n = 1, R^ as	isoprop^i and R* as hydrogen), 2-chloro-2-methyi[propionyl chloride (providing n = 1 and R^ and R* as methyl), and so on. Formation of benzosazinones in this manner can be achieved under relativdy mild polar conditions in the presence of a mild base, as described by Combs et al.; /. Med. Chem.; 33; 380-386 1990. The cyclization may also be achieved by reacting fe with a 2-hydroxyester under Mitsunobu reaction conditions, as described by Van Hess et ai in WO 01/14330. See also Heterocydes 1983, vol 20(8), pp. 1481-1485, for synthesis of substituted benzoxazinones.<br>
In Step 3, an N-aEqdation of the benzoxazinone compound m is carried out by<br>
treatment of compound m with a strong base under dry, polar aprotic conditions and<br>
reaction with an a-haloalkj^ aryi compound n to provide the N-arjdalkyi-benzoxazinone<br>
compound o. The haloaHcjd aryi compound n may comprise, for example, benzyl halide,	f<br>
3-haIo-3-phenylpropane, a-mefjiyibenzyi halide, or otter o-taloalfcyiphenyi halides according to the desired R and R^ substituent configuration.<br>
The alkylation of Step 3 may also be carried out using a-haloaBcjd napthyl compounds, a-haloalk^iphenyi compounds or other a-haloalkylaryi compounds. In other embodiments Step 3 may be carried out using a-haloallcji heteroarji compounds such as a-haloalkylpyridines, a-haloallcjdthiophenes, a-lmloallqdmethylenedJoxyphenyl compounds, a-haloalkyiethylenediosyphenyl compounds, and the like. In the case of a-haioalkyi heteroaryl compounds, suitable protection group strategies may be employed to avoid unwanted heteroatom alkylation during this step.<br>
A cross coupling amination reaction is tiien carried out in Step 4 wl^rein the N-arylalkyi- bemxpaziaone compound o is reacted with a nitrogen-containing heterocyde f<br><br>
in the presence of a palladium catalyst to replace the leaving group G -with, a Heterocydyi group and provide tke iLeterocydyi-N-aiylalkyl-benzoxazinone compound Im. In many embodiments g and r are 2, such. tba.t the heterocyde compound f is a piperazine compound as described above io Example A. Where R^^ is hydrogen, BOC protection or other removable protection strat^es may be used to protect the esposed nitrogen of heterocydic amine £<br>
The heterocydyl-N-aryialkyi-benzoxazinone compound ^ is a compound of formula I wherein X is O, Y is -(CR^R^)D-, p is 1, q and r are 2, A is optionally substituted phenyiene, and E is N. As in the case of Scheme A, many variations on the above procedure are possible and maybe used to prepare other compounds of formula I in accordance with the invention.<br>
In ofiier embodiments of tiie invention, Step 4 of Scheme B maybe omitted and Steps 5-7 carried out in place thereof in the manner described above for Scheme A Thus, in Step 5, the N-allq^ted beuzoxazinone Q of Step 3 is hthiated via treatment widi allcylithium reagent as described-above for Sdieme A, to provide a Hthiated benzoxazinone pt. An alkyiation may then be carried out in Step 6 by reaction of lithiated "benzoxazinone ^ with heterocydyi ketone h to yidd compoimd a- Heteiocydyi ketone h maybe an optionally substituted piperidinone or an optionally substituted pyrroHdinone as noted above, and a suitable protection strategy for the nitrogen heteroatom may be employed where R"° is hydrogen.

Example 5<br>
Radioligand hi"nding studies<br>
This example illustrates in vitro radioligand binding studies of compound of formula I.<br>
The bindir^ activity of compounds of this invention in vitro was determined as follows. Duplicate determinations of Hgand affinity are made by competing for binding of [TJ]LSD in cell manbranes derived from HEK293 cells stably expressing recombinant human 5-HT6 receptor. This cell line was prepared by the method described by Monsma et aL, Molecular Pliarmacohsy, Vol 43 pp. 320-327 (1993).<br>
All determinations were made in assay buffer containing 50 mM Tiis-HQ, 10 mM MgS04,0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM ascorbic add, pH 7.4 at 37 "C, in a 250 microliter reaction volume. Assay tubes containing [^H] LSD (5 nM), competing ligand, and membrane were incubated in a shaking wra.ter bath for 60 min. at 37 °C, filtered onto Packard GF-B plates (pre-soaked with 0.3% PEI) using a Padcard 96 wdl cell harvester and washed 3 times in ice cold 50 mM Tris-HCL Bound [^H] LSD was determined as radioactive counts per minute using Packard TopCounL<br>
Displacement of [3H]LSD from the binding sites was quantified by fitting concentration-binding data to a 4-parameter logistic equation:<br>
, .  ,.       ,     ,   f	Bmax-basal<br>
where HiU is the Hill slope, [Ugand] is the concentration of competing radioligand and IC50 is the concentration of radioligand producing half-masimal specific binding of radioligand. The ^edfic binding window is the difference between the Bmax and the basal parameters.<br>
Using the procedures of this Example, compounds of Formula I were tested and found to be selective 5-HT6 antagonists as shown below:<br><br><br>

The cogiiition-enliandng properties of compoimds ofthe invention may be in a model of animal cognition: the object recognition task model.  4-montii-oldmale"TOstar rats (Charles River, The Netherlands) were used. Compounds were prepared daily and dissolved in physiological saline and tested at tJiree doses. Administration WES always given i.p. (injection volume 1 ml/kg) 60 minutes before Tl. Scopolamine hydrobromide was injected 30 minutes after compound injection. Two equal testing groups were made of 24 rats and were tested by two experimenters. The testing order of doses was detejmined randomly. The experiments were performed using a double bHnd protocol. M rats were treated once witii each dose condition. The object recognition test was performed as described by Ennaceur, A., Delacour, J., 1988, A new one-trial test for<br><br>
