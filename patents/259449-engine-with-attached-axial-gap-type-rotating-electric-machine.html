This application claims priority from Japanese Patent<br>
Application No. 2007-026941 filed on February 6, 2007.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an engine with an<br>
attached axial gap type rotating electric machine.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
JP-A-2006-271040 discloses an engine with an attached<br>
axial gap type rotating electric machine. This engine with<br>
the attached axial gap type rotating electric machine is<br>
provided with a crank case, a crank shaft that is driven to<br>
rotate around a center axis by a piston within the crank case,<br>
and an axial gap type rotating electric machine that is<br>
connected via a belt-type continuously variable transmission<br>
to one end of the crank shaft within the crank case.<br>
The axial gap type rotating electric machine is disposed<br>
in parallel to the crank shaft, and is provided with a rotating<br>
electric machine side shaft that has one end that is linked<br>
to the belt-type continuously variable transmission, a rotor<br>
that is fixed to the other end of the rotating electric machine<br>
side shaft, and a stator that is fixed to the crank case at<br>
a position further toward the other end than the rotor, with<br>
1<br><br>
the  rotating  electric  machine  side  shaft  inserted<br>
therethrough.<br>
A plurality of permanent magnets are disposed orthogonal<br>
to the axial center of the rotating electric machine side shaft<br>
in a surface of the rotor that faces the stator. The stator<br>
has a magnetic flux generating area that faces each permanent<br>
magnet in the axial direction.<br>
More specifically, the stator includes a first stator<br>
that has first teeth that form the magnetic flux generating<br>
area, and a second stator that has second teeth that rotate<br>
relatively with respect to the first teeth around the axial<br>
center. The second teeth have a structure that allows a gap,<br>
which generates magnetic resistance, between the second teeth<br>
and the first teeth to be varied.<br>
The first stator is fixed to the crank case, and the<br>
second stator is provided with a driving mechanism that causes<br>
the second stator to rotate relatively with respect to the first<br>
stator.<br>
The related engine with the attached axial gap type<br>
rotating electric machine with the above-described structure<br>
is mounted in a straddle-type vehicle, most typically a<br>
motorcycle. Furthermore, the engine with the attached axial<br>
gap type rotating electric machine can be used to run a<br>
straddle-type vehicle. In this case, the axial gap type<br>
rotating electric machine provides auxiliary drive for the<br>
2<br><br>
crank shaft that is driven to rotate around the axial center<br>
by the piston, or stops the rotation of the crank shaft caused<br>
by the piston such that the crank shaft is just driven by the<br>
axial gap type rotating electric machine.<br>
However, in this engine with the attached axial gap type<br>
rotating electric machine, a drive mechanism rotates the<br>
second stator, thereby changing the gap that generates the<br>
magnetic resistance between the first teeth and the second<br>
teeth. As a result, the relationship of the rotational speed<br>
and the rotational torque can be controlled. Accordingly, the<br>
engine with the attached axial gap type rotating electric<br>
machine can change the output characteristics of the axial gap<br>
type rotating electric machine in accordance with the running<br>
state of the straddle-type vehicle, for example, can change<br>
to a high torque low speed mode or a low torque high speed mode.<br>
However, in the related engine with the attached axial<br>
gap type rotating electric machine, the axial gap type rotating<br>
electric machine is connected to the crank shaft via a belt-type<br>
continuously variable transmission, which makes reducing the<br>
size of the engine with the attached axial gap type rotating<br>
electric machine difficult. As a result, the engine with the<br>
attached axial gap type rotating electric machine is more<br>
difficult to mount in the straddle-type vehicle etc.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
3<br><br>
The invention has been devised in light of the<br>
above-described circumstances, and it is an object thereof to<br>
provide an engine with an attached axial gap type rotating<br>
electric machine that is extremely easy to mount.<br>
An engine with an attached axial gap type rotating<br>
electric machine of the invention includes: a crank case that<br>
includes therein a crank shaft, the crank shaft being driven<br>
to rotate around a center axis by a piston and being inserted<br>
within the crank case such the crank shaft can rotate;<br>
a rotor, fixed to one end side of the crank shaft at the<br>
outside of the crank case, that includes a plurality of<br>
permanent magnets that are orthogonal to the center axis; and<br>
a stator, fixed to the crank case with the crank shaft<br>
inserted therein, that has a magnetic flux generating area that<br>
faces the permanent magnets in the axial direction. In this<br>
engine with the attached axial gap type rotating electric<br>
machine, the stator includes a first stator that has first-teeth<br>
that form the magnetic flux generating area, and a second stator<br>
that has second teeth. A gap between the first teeth and the<br>
second teeth that generates magnetic resistance can be varied<br>
by rotating the second teeth around the center axis relative<br>
to the first teeth. The engine with the attached axial gap<br>
type rotating electric machine further includes a drive<br>
mechanism that relatively rotates either one or both of the<br>
first stator and the second stator.<br>
4<br><br>
In the engine with the attached axial gap type rotating<br>
electric machine of the invention with the above-described<br>
structure (hereinafter, "axial gap type rotating electric<br>
machine" will be referred to simply as "rotating electric<br>
machine") , the stator and the rotor are disposed on an extension<br>
line of the center axis of the crank shaft. Thus, size<br>
reduction as compared to the known technology can be promoted<br>
in which the rotating electric machine is connected to the crank<br>
shaft using a belt-type continuously variable transmission or<br>
the like.<br>
In addition, in the engine with attached rotating<br>
electric machine, because the rotor is disposed further to the<br>
outside than the stator, the fan that can blow air can be fixed<br>
to the rotor and caused to rotate along with the rotor. Thus,<br>
a structure is provided that makes it easier to cool the engine<br>
with attached rotating electric machine while promoting size<br>
reduction, and easier to cool a radiator that is disposed in<br>
the vicinity of the engine with attached rotating electric<br>
machine.<br>
Accordingly, the engine with attached rotating electric<br>
machine can be mounted extremely easily.<br>
The manner in which the stator is fixed to the crank case<br>
includes, in addition to directly fixing the stator to the crank<br>
case, indirectly fixing the stator to the crank case via a cover<br>
or the like that is included as a component of the crank case.<br>
5<br><br>
In the engine with the attached rotating electric machine<br>
of the invention, the drive mechanism may be attached to a<br>
vehicle body frame or the like, or alternatively may be attached<br>
to the crank case. If the latter structure is adopted, ease<br>
of mounting is improved still further.<br>
The manner in which the drive mechanism is attached to<br>
the crank case includes, in addition to directly fixing the<br>
drive mechanism to the crank case, indirectly fixing the drive<br>
mechanism to the crank case via the cover or the like that is<br>
included as a component of the crank case.<br>
In the engine with attached rotating electric machine<br>
of the invention, the rotor has a cup like shape and includes<br>
a yoke that extends from the center axis in the radial direction,<br>
and an outer cylindrical member, extending from an outer<br>
periphery edge of the yoke toward the stator side, that covers,<br>
at the least, a section of an outer periphery of the stator.<br>
With this structure, the cup shaped rotor covers the gap between<br>
the rotor and the stator, and thus it is difficult for foreign<br>
objects like dirt or the like to enter in to the gap. Accordingly,<br>
durability is substantially improved.<br>
In the engine with attached rotating electric machine<br>
of the invention, the permanent magnets may be embedded in the<br>
rotor and arranged together. However, it is favorable that<br>
the permanent magnets are arranged inside the rotor. If a<br>
structure is adopted in which the permanent magnets are<br>
6<br><br>
arranged inside the rotor, it is possible to reliably reduce<br>
the size of the gap in the axial direction between the facing<br>
permanent magnets and the magnetic flux generating area.<br>
Accordingly, the engine with attached rotating electric<br>
machine can fully demonstrate the performance of the rotating<br>
electric machine.<br>
The engine with attached rotating electric machine of<br>
the invention may further include a gap adjustment mechanism,<br>
provided between the crank case, the crank shaft, the rotor<br>
and the stator, that determines a gap between the permanent<br>
magnets and the magnetic flux generating area in the axial<br>
direction. If this structure is adopted, the engine with<br>
attached rotating electric machine is able to reliably reduce<br>
the occurrence of variation in the gap in the axial direction<br>
between the permanent magnets and the magnetic flux generating<br>
area, thereby allowing the performance of the rotating<br>
electric machine to be reliably demonstrated to an even higher<br>
level.<br>
In the engine with attached rotating electric machine<br>
of the invention, the gap adjustment mechanism may include a<br>
first regulation mechanism that regulates a position in the<br>
axial direction of the crank shaft and the rotor, and a second<br>
regulation mechanism that regulates a position in the axial<br>
direction of the crank case and the stator while providing<br>
tolerance for variation in the position in the axial direction<br>
7<br><br>
of the crank shaft and the rotor. If this structure is adopted,<br>
the engine with attached rotating electric machine is able to<br>
reliably reduce the occurrence of variation in the gap in the<br>
axial direction between the permanent magnets and the magnetic<br>
flux generating area, thereby allowing the performance of the<br>
rotating electric machine to be reliably demonstrated to an<br>
even higher level.<br>
In the engine with attached rotating electric machine<br>
of the invention, the first regulation mechanism has a<br>
structure in which one end of the crank shaft and the rotor<br>
are fitted together using a tapered structure, and the second<br>
regulation mechanism has a structure that includes a bearing<br>
support member that is provided in an outer periphery surface<br>
of a small diameter cylindrical member that protrudes from a<br>
center of the rotor toward the stator side, a bearing support<br>
member that is provided in an inner periphery surface of the<br>
stator, a bearing that is provided between the bearing support<br>
members, and an engagement pin and an engagement hole,<br>
respectively provided in the stator and the crank case, that<br>
provide tolerance for mutual movement in the axial direction.<br>
If this structure is adopted, it is possible to reliably<br>
reduce the occurrence of variation in the gap in the axial<br>
direction between the permanent magnets and the magnetic flux<br>
generating area. Note that, in a modified example of the first<br>
regulation mechanism, the crank shaft and the rotor can be<br>
8<br><br>
spline-engaged.<br>
In the engine with attached rotating electric machine<br>
of the invention, it is favorable if the first stator is fixed<br>
to the crank case, and the second stator is rotatably provided<br>
on the crank case. If this structure is adopted, in the engine<br>
with attached rotating electric machine, there is no need to<br>
rotate the first teeth, which have a structure that is more<br>
complicated than the second teeth and that form the magnetic<br>
flux generating area, and thus the device structure of the<br>
engine can be simplified.<br>
The engine with attached rotating electric machine of<br>
the invention may further include: a fan that can blow wind<br>
that is fixed to and integrated with the outside of the rotor.<br>
Thus, the engine with attached rotating electric machine has<br>
a structure that makes it easier to cool the engine with<br>
attached rotating electric machine using the fan, and easier<br>
to cool the radiator that is disposed in the vicinity of the<br>
engine with attached rotating electric machine. In addition,<br>
as a result of integrally fixing the fan to the rotor that is<br>
lighter than the stator, rotational resistance is reduced.<br>
In the engine with attached rotating electric machine<br>
of the invention, the fan may intake air from the outside in<br>
the axial direction, and blow out air to the outside in the<br>
radial direction with respect to the center axis. If this<br>
structure is adopted, a large intake port can be provided in<br>
9<br><br>
the outside in the vehicle width direction of the straddle-type<br>
vehicle or the like in which the engine with attached rotating<br>
electric machine is mounted, thereby making it easier to intake<br>
cool external air that has not been heated by the engine with<br>
attached rotating electric machine, and to lead exhausted air<br>
to the outside of the vehicle, such as a straddle-type vehicle.<br>
The fan that intakes air from the outside in the axial<br>
direction and that blows the air to the outside in the radial<br>
direction with respect to the center axis may be a sirocco fan.<br>
However, the fan is not limited to this, and may be a turbo<br>
fan, or a combination of a sirocco fan and a turbo fan.<br>
The engine with attached rotating electric machine of<br>
the invention may further include: a radiator that is provided<br>
in the crank case to the outside of the fan. If this structure<br>
is adopted, the engine with attached rotating electric machine<br>
can improve engine performance using water cooling. More<br>
particularly, if the fan is of a type that intakes air from<br>
the outside in the axial direction, cool external air can be<br>
caused to hit the radiator, thereby effectively cooling the<br>
radiator.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Hereinafter, a concrete embodiment of the invention will<br>
be described with reference to the drawings.<br>
[Embodiments]<br>
As can be seen from FIG. 1 to FIG. 4, an engine with an<br>
attached axial gap type rotating electric machine 50<br>
(hereinafter simply referred to as "engine with attached<br>
rotating electric machine 50") of this embodiment is mounted<br>
in a motorcycle 1.<br>
The motorcycle 1, as shown in FIG. 1, is provided with<br>
a front wheel 3 at a vehicle body front lower section. The<br>
front wheel 3 is rotatably supported by a lower end section<br>
of a front fork 5. A steering shaft 7 that extends upwards<br>
is connected to an upper end section of the front fork 5. A<br>
handle 9 that extends in the vehicle width direction is attached<br>
to an upper end section of the steering shaft 7. Grips 11 are<br>
attached to either end of the handle 9. A vehicle body frame<br>
10 is attached to a central section of the steering shaft 7.<br>
The vehicle body frame 10 extends diagonally downward<br>
toward a vehicle body rear section, and then curves to extend<br>
horizontally. Then, the vehicle body frame 10 curves again<br>
before extending straight. A seat 13 is disposed on a rear<br>
upper side of the vehicle body frame 10. An upper end section<br>
12<br><br>
of a rear suspension 15 is connected to a rear end section of<br>
the vehicle body frame 10.<br>
As can be seen from FIG. 2, a lower end section of the<br>
rear suspension 15 is connected to a rear end section 16a of<br>
a rear arm 16 that is one section of the vehicle body frame<br>
10. The rear arm 16 rotatably supports a rear wheel 17.<br>
Driving force of the engine with attached rotating electric<br>
machine 50 is transmitted to the rear wheel 17 via a drive force<br>
transmission mechanism such as a belt-type continuously<br>
variable transmission, thus rotatably driving the rear wheel<br>
17. The engine with attached rotating electric machine 50 is<br>
disposed beneath the central section of the vehicle body frame<br>
10.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, the engine with attached rotating<br>
electric machine 50 is provided with a crank case 60, a crank<br>
shaft 51, and an axial gap type rotating electric machine 20<br>
(hereinafter simply referred to as "rotating electric machine<br>
20") .<br>
The crank case 60 includes a crank case body 61, and a<br>
crank case cover 62 that is positioned to the outside in the<br>
vehicle width direction (the direction indicated by a shown<br>
in FIG. 3) of the crank case body 61. The crank case cover<br>
62 has a generally flat tabular shape. An engagement member<br>
62b is formed in the crank case cover 62 in the inside in the<br>
vehicle width direction (the direction opposite to that<br>
13<br><br>
indicated by a in FIG. 3) . The engagement member 62b is fitted<br>
in to an engaged member 61b that is formed in the outside in<br>
the vehicle width direction of the crank case body 61. As a<br>
result, the crank case cover 62 is assembled as an integrated<br>
unit with the crank case body 61.<br>
An insertion hole 61a that has a center axis that is<br>
aligned with a center axis X of the crank shaft 51 is formed<br>
in the outside in the vehicle width direction of the crank case<br>
body 61. An insertion hole 62a that has a center axis that<br>
is aligned with the center axis X is also formed in the crank<br>
case cover 62.<br>
The crank shaft 51 is disposed inside the crank case body<br>
61, and is connected via a connecting rod 50c to a piston (not<br>
shown in the figures) that is housed within a cylinder (not<br>
shown in the figures) that is provided in a central section<br>
of the engine with attached rotating electric machine 50. An<br>
end section 51c to the outside in the vehicle width direction<br>
of the crank shaft 51 extends through the insertion holes 61a,<br>
62a, and protrudes further to the outside in the vehicle width<br>
direction than the insertion hole 62a.<br>
A bearing 52a that rotatably supports the crank shaft<br>
51 such that it rotates around the center axis X is disposed<br>
between the crank shaft 51 and the insertion hole 61a. In<br>
addition, a bearing 52b that rotatably supports the crank shaft<br>
51 such that it rotates around the center axis X is provided<br>
14<br><br>
in the crank case body 61. As a result, the crank shaft 51<br>
is driven to rotate around the center axis X inside the crank<br>
case 60 by the up-down motion of the piston. Moreover, a seal<br>
member 54 that seals a gap between the crank shaft 51 and the<br>
crank case 60 is provided between the crank shaft 51 and the<br>
insertion hole 62a.<br>
The rotating electric machine 20 is disposed at the<br>
outside in the vehicle width direction of the crank case 60.<br>
The rotating electric machine 20 is provided with a rotor 21,<br>
a stator 25, and a drive mechanism 80.<br>
The rotor 21, as can be seen from FIG. 4, includes a small<br>
diameter cylindrical member 22, a yoke 23, and an outer<br>
cylindrical member 23a. An inner periphery surface of the<br>
small diameter cylindrical member 22 is formed as a tapered<br>
surface 22a that has a diameter that becomes smaller as the<br>
tapered surface 22a extends toward the outside in the vehicle<br>
width direction. On the other hand, an outer periphery surf ace<br>
of the end section 51c of the crank shaft 51 is formed as a<br>
tapered surface 51b that has a diameter that becomes smaller<br>
as the tapered surface 51b extends toward the outside in the<br>
vehicle width direction. Accordingly, when the small diameter<br>
cylindrical member 22 of the rotor 21 is fitted to the end<br>
section 51c of the crank shaft 51, the tapered surface 51b is<br>
placed in contact with the tapered surface 22a. In addition,<br>
a nut 57 is screwed on to a male screw formed in the end section<br>
15<br><br>
51c. The nut 57 presses the rotor 21 toward the central section<br>
of the crank shaft 51, whereby the tapered surface 51b and the<br>
tapered surface 22a are held together under pressure. As a<br>
result of adopting this structure, the rotor 21 is fixed to<br>
the end section 51c side of the crank shaft 51, and the position<br>
of the rotor 21 in the center axis X direction with respect<br>
to the crank shaft 51 is determined.<br>
The structure in which the end section 51c of the crank<br>
shaft 51 and the rotor 21 are fitted together using tapered<br>
surfaces, namely, using the tapered surface 51b and the tapered<br>
surface 22a, corresponds to a first regulation mechanism that<br>
regulates the position of the crank shaft 51 and the rotor 21<br>
in the center axis X direction. In addition, with the first<br>
regulation mechanism, there is a possibility that variation<br>
in the position of the crank shaft 51 and the rotor 21 in the<br>
center axis X direction may occur as a result of the<br>
characteristics of the taper fit. However, a second<br>
regulation mechanism described later is structured so as to<br>
provide tolerance for such variation.<br>
A groove 22h that extends in the center axis X direction<br>
is formed in the tapered surface 22a of the small diameter<br>
cylindrical member 22. On the other hand, a recess having a<br>
semicircular shape is formed in the tapered surface 51b of the<br>
end section 51c of the crank shaft 51. A key 22g with a<br>
corresponding shape is fitted in to this recess. An edge of<br>
16<br><br>
the key 22g protrudes from the tapered surface 51b, and engages<br>
with the groove 22h. As a result of adopting this structure,<br>
the key 22g is engaged with both the rotor 21 and the crank<br>
shaft 51, thereby providing a structure in which the rotor 21<br>
rotates along with the crank shaft 51.<br>
The yoke 23 has a generally disk like shape that extends<br>
from the small diameter cylindrical member 22 in the radial<br>
direction. In addition, a plurality of permanent magnets 24<br>
(field magnets) are fixed to the inside in the vehicle width<br>
direction of the yoke 23, and are arranged in a circular manner<br>
and orthogonal to the center axis X.<br>
The outer cylindrical member 23a is a cylindrical body<br>
that covers at least a section of the outer periphery of the<br>
stator 25, described hereinafter, and extends toward the<br>
inside in the vehicle width direction from an outer periphery<br>
edge of the yoke 23. Due to providing the yoke 23 and the outer<br>
cylindrical member 23a, the rotor has a cup like shape, and<br>
thus a gap between the rotor 21 and the stator 25 is covered.<br>
Accordingly, it is difficult for foreign objects like dirt or<br>
the like to enter in to the gap between the rotor 21 and the<br>
stator 25.<br>
A cooling fan 65 that functions as a fan that can generate<br>
air flow is integrally fixed by a bolt 65a to the outside in<br>
the vehicle width direction of the yoke 23. The cooling fan<br>
65 is a sirocco fan that is thin in the center axis X direction.<br>
17<br><br>
The cooling fan 65 is formed by a plurality of integrated vanes<br>
that can intake air from the outside in the center axis X<br>
direction (outside in the vehicle width direction), and can<br>
blow out the air to the outside in the radial direction with<br>
respect to the center axis X.<br>
As can be seen from FIG. 3, a radiator 66 is disposed<br>
at the outside in the vehicle width direction of the cooling<br>
fan 65. The radiator 66 is assembled together with a support<br>
member (not shown in the figures) that extends toward the<br>
outside in the vehicle width direction from the crank case 60.<br>
A large intake port 66a is disposed at the outside in the vehicle<br>
width direction of the radiator 66. Cool external air, which<br>
enters via the intake port 66a from the outside in the vehicle<br>
width direction as a result of rotation of the cooling fan 65,<br>
directly hits the radiator 66. As a result, coolant that<br>
circulates between the radiator 66 and a cylinder block (not<br>
shown in the figures) of the engine 50 is effectively cooled.<br>
In addition, a discharge port 66b is provided at the outside<br>
in the radial direction of the cooling fan 65. Air that is<br>
discharged from the cooling fan 65 to the outside in the radial<br>
direction can be smoothly discharged to the outside of the<br>
vehicle. Note that, hypothetically speaking, if the blow<br>
direction of the cooling fan 65 is reversed, air that is warmed<br>
by the heat of the engine with attached rotating electric<br>
machine 50 hits the radiator 66, whereby cooling efficiency<br>
18<br><br>
is lowered. However, the above-described structure<br>
eliminates the possibility of this type of problem occurring.<br>
The stator 25 is fixed to the outside in the vehicle width<br>
direction of the crank case 60 with the crank shaft 51 inserted<br>
therein. The stator 25 is disposed further to the inside in<br>
the vehicle width direction than the rotor 21. In addition,<br>
the stator 25 has an end surface (magnetic flux generating area)<br>
34a that faces each of the permanent magnets 24 in the center<br>
axis X direction.<br>
More specifically, the stator 25 is provided with a fixed<br>
stator 30 that functions as a first stator that is positioned<br>
on the rotor 21 side, and a moveable stator 40 that functions<br>
as a second stator that is positioned at the crank case cover<br>
62 side.<br>
As can be seen from FIG. 3 to FIG. 5, the fixed stator<br>
30 is provided with a plurality of first teeth 34 formed by<br>
magnetic cores. Each first tooth 34 is arranged in a ring like<br>
shape that encircles the crank shaft 51. The end surface<br>
(magnetic flux generating area) 34a of each first tooth 34 at<br>
the rotor 21 side faces each permanent magnet 24 of the rotor<br>
21.<br>
A coil 31 that generates a magnetic flux when energized<br>
is wound around each first tooth 34. The first teeth 34 and<br>
the coil 31 are molded in to a resin member 36 that is made<br>
from resin and that includes a lubricant. The resin member<br>
19<br><br>
36 is formed in a ring like shape that centers on the center<br>
axis X. As shown in the enlarge view of FIG. 5, the resin member<br>
36 has an inner periphery section 36b that is generally<br>
cylindrical and positioned at the inside in the diameter<br>
direction of a coil group that is made up of a plurality of<br>
coils 31. In addition, the resin member 36 has an outer<br>
periphery section 36a that is generally cylindrical and<br>
positioned at the outside in the diameter direction of the coil<br>
group that is made up of the plurality of coils 31.<br>
The outer periphery section 36a has a protrusion 36c that<br>
extends toward the crank case cover 62 side (the inside in the<br>
vehicle width direction). A plurality of engagement holes 37<br>
are formed in an end surface of the protrusion 36c at the crank<br>
case cover 62 side (the inside in the vehicle width direction)<br>
and extend parallel with the center axis X. On the other hand,<br>
a plurality of engagement pins 59 that protrude toward the<br>
outside in the vehicle width direction are formed at positions<br>
that correspond with the respective engagement holes 37 of the<br>
crank case cover 62 such that the engagement pins 59 can fit<br>
in to the respective engagement holes 37. In addition, each<br>
engagement pin 59 is fitted in to each engagement hole 37 so<br>
that the fixed stator 30 is fixed to the crank case cover 62<br>
so as not to be capable of rotation around the center axis X.<br>
The depth of each engagement hole 37 is made larger than the<br>
protrusion length of each engagement pin 59. Therefore, the<br>
20<br><br>
relative position of each engagement hole 37 and each<br>
engagement pin 59 is not restricted in the center axis X<br>
direction.<br>
A radial bearing 63 is disposed between an inner<br>
periphery surface of the inner periphery section 36b and an<br>
outer periphery surface of the small diameter cylindrical<br>
member 22.<br>
More particularly, a bearing support member 36i is<br>
provided in the inner periphery surface of the inner periphery<br>
section 36b. This bearing support member 36i includes a<br>
bearing contact surface 36j and a bearing support surface 36c.<br>
The bearing support surface 36c is formed to be perpendicular<br>
to the center axis X, namely, faces the rotor 21. The bearing<br>
support surface 36c is positioned in the vicinity of a center<br>
point between an end section of the inner periphery section<br>
36b at the rotor 21 side and an end section of the inner<br>
periphery section 36b at the moveable stator 40 side. The<br>
bearing contact surface 36j is formed to have a cylindrical<br>
shape that centers on the center axis X, and contacts an outer<br>
periphery surface 63a of the radial bearing 63.<br>
In addition, a bearing support member 22e is formed at<br>
an outer periphery side of the small diameter cylindrical<br>
member 22. The bearing support member 22e includes a bearing<br>
contact surface 22f and a bearing support surface 22d. The<br>
bearing support surface 22d is formed to be perpendicular to<br>
21<br><br>
the center axis X, namely, faces the fixed stator 30. The<br>
bearing support surface 22d is positioned in the vicinity of<br>
a center point in the center axis X direction of the small<br>
diameter cylindrical member 22. The bearing contact surface<br>
22f is formed to have a cylindrical shape that centers on the<br>
center axis X, and contacts an inner periphery surface 63b of<br>
the radial bearing 63.<br>
The radial bearing 63 is disposed between the bearing<br>
support surface 36c and the bearing support surface 22d in the<br>
center axis X direction. Note that, in the above explanation,<br>
because the respective engagement holes 37 and the engagement<br>
pins 59 do not have their respective relative positions in the<br>
center axis X direction regulated, the fixed stator 30 is pulled<br>
toward the rotor 21 side by magnetism of the permanent magnets<br>
24. At this time, the bearing support surface 22d supports<br>
the fixed stator 30 via the radial bearing 63 and the bearing<br>
support surface 36c in resistance to the attracting force (the<br>
magnetism). As a result, a gap h is maintained between the<br>
facing surface 24a of each permanent magnet 24 that faces the<br>
fixed stator 30 and the end surfaces (the magnetic flux<br>
generating area) 34a of the first teeth 34 that face the<br>
permanent magnets 24. Note that, the gap h is more specifically<br>
the gap between each permanent magnet 24 and the end surfaces<br>
(the magnetic flux generating area) 34a in the center axis X<br>
direction. The gap h can be determined by the position of the<br>
22<br><br>
bearing support surface 36c of the fixed stator 30, the width<br>
of the radial bearing 63 in the center axis X direction, and<br>
the position of the bearing support surface 22d of the small<br>
diameter cylindrical member 22.<br>
In addition, the radial bearing 63 is in contact with<br>
both the bearing contact surface 36j of the fixed stator 30<br>
and the bearing contact surface 22f of the small diameter<br>
cylindrical member 22 . Thus, the radial bearing 63 can provide<br>
support such that relative rotation is possible, without<br>
causing diameter direction misalignment of the fixed stator<br>
30 or the rotor 21.<br>
The radial bearing 63, the bearing support member 36i<br>
of the fixed stator 30, the bearing support member 22e of the<br>
small diameter cylindrical member 22, the engagement holes 37,<br>
and the engagement pins 59 correspond to a second regulation<br>
mechanism that permits variation in the position in the center<br>
axis X direction of the crank shaft 51 and the rotor 21, but<br>
regulates the position in the center axis X direction of the<br>
crank case 60 and the stator 25. In addition, the second<br>
regulation mechanism and the above-described first regulation<br>
mechanism form a gap adjustment mechanism that determines the<br>
gap h in the center axis X direction between the permanent<br>
magnets 24 and the end surfaces (magnetic flux generating area)<br>
34a.<br>
Next, the moveable stator 40 will be explained.  The<br>
23<br><br>
moveable stator 40, as described above, is disposed further<br>
to the crank case cover 62 side than the fixed stator 30 with<br>
respect to the rotor 21, and faces the fixed stator 30.<br>
The moveable stator 40 is provided with second teeth 41,<br>
and a ring shaped base 42. The number of provided second teeth<br>
41 is the same as the first teeth 34. The base 42 supports<br>
the second teeth 41 that are arranged in a ring like shape<br>
centering on the center axis X. The base 42 and the second<br>
teeth 41 are molded in to a resin member 43 that is made from<br>
resin and that includes a lubricant. Each second tooth 41 is<br>
formed by a magnetic core. Magnetism generation by<br>
energization of the coil 31 exerts a force that pulls the second<br>
teeth 41 toward the first teeth 34 side. However, a holding<br>
member (not shown in the figures) holds the second teeth 41<br>
such that there is a determined distance of separation from<br>
the first teeth 34 in the center axis X direction. In addition,<br>
the moveable stator 40, as described below, is capable of<br>
relative rotation with respect to the fixed stator 30 around<br>
the center axis X direction.<br>
The drive mechanism 80, as can be seen from FIG. 4 and<br>
FIG. 6, is disposed at the outside in the vehicle width<br>
direction of the crank case cover 62, and to the outside in<br>
the diameter direction of the moveable stator 40. The drive<br>
mechanism 80 includes a drive motor 81 and the gear mechanism<br>
82.  The gear mechanism 82 includes a worm gear 82a, a worm<br>
24<br><br>
wheel 82b, and a missing tooth gear 82c. When the drive motor<br>
81 rotates, as shown in FIG. 6, the worm wheel 82b rotates within<br>
a determined angular range, and driving force is transmitted<br>
to a missing tooth gear 82d that is formed on a section of the<br>
outer periphery surface of the moveable stator 40 via the<br>
missing tooth gear 82c. As a result, in the drive mechanism<br>
80, when the drive motor 81 rotates in the forward or reverse<br>
direction, the moveable stator 40 turns around the center axis<br>
X, and rotates relative to the fixed stator 30.<br>
In the rotating electric machine 20 with the<br>
above-described structure, relative rotation of the moveable<br>
stator 40 and the fixed stator 30 causes change in output<br>
characteristics as described below. Thus drive can be<br>
performed at high torque low speed or at low torque high speed.<br>
FIG. 7 to FIG. 9 show different states when the moveable<br>
stator 40 is relatively rotated with respect to the fixed stator<br>
30 around the center axis X. Note that, for the sake of<br>
explanatory simplicity, illustrations of the resin member 36<br>
of the fixed stator 30 shown in FIG. 3 to FIG. 5, the resin<br>
member 43 of the moveable stator 40, the crank shaft 51, and<br>
the coil 31 etc. are omitted. In addition, in FIG. 7 to FIG.<br>
9, the same members as shown in FIG. 3 to FIG. 5 are denoted<br>
with the same reference numerals.<br>
FIG. 7 shows a state when the second teeth 41 of the<br>
moveable stator 40 are aligned with the first teeth 34 of the<br>
25<br><br>
fixed stator 30. In this state, the gap, which generates<br>
magnetic resistance, between the end surface 34b at the second<br>
teeth 41 side of the first teeth 34 and the end surface 41a<br>
at the first teeth 34 side of the second teeth 41 is at its<br>
smallest value k (refer to FIG. 5). At this time, magnetic<br>
flux flow is generated in the first teeth 34 and the second<br>
teeth 41, the base 42, and each permanent magnet 24. This<br>
magnetic flux flow flows from the end surface 34a of the first<br>
teeth 34 at the permanent magnets 24 side to the end surface<br>
34b on the opposite side. In other words, in this state, the<br>
magnetic flux flow flows within the coil 31.<br>
When drive of the drive mechanism 80 causes the moveable<br>
stator 40 to rotate through the intermediate position shown<br>
in FIG. 8 to the position shown in FIG. 9, namely, where the<br>
second teeth 41 has rotated to a center position between the<br>
first teeth 34 and neighboring first teeth 34, the gap, which<br>
generates magnetic resistance, between the end surface 34b at<br>
the second teeth 41 side of the first teeth 34 and the end<br>
surface 41a at the first teeth 34 side of the second teeth 41<br>
becomes larger. At this time, the magnetic flux flow does not<br>
flow in the second teeth 41, and a magnetic flux flow flows<br>
in the permanent magnets 24 and the first teeth 34 in the<br>
vicinity of the rotor 21. This magnetic flux flow does not<br>
flow inside the coil 31, and thus as compared to the state shown<br>
in FIG. 7, the magnetic flux flow is weak.  In the state shown<br>
26<br><br>
in FIG. 9, because the magnetic flux flow is weak, the rotating<br>
electric machine 20 functions as a rotating electric machine<br>
of a low torque high speed type. On the other hand, in the<br>
state shown in FIG. 7, the magnetic flux flow is stronger than<br>
that shown in FIG. 9, because it flows inside the coil 31, and<br>
the rotating electric machine 20 functions as a rotating<br>
electric machine of a high torque low speed type.<br>
The engine with attached rotating electric machine 50<br>
of this embodiment with the above-described structure can use<br>
the rotating electric machine 20 to provide auxiliary drive<br>
for the crank shaft 51 that is caused to rotate around the center<br>
axis X by the piston. In addition, the engine with attached<br>
rotating electric machine 50 can stop the rotation of the crank<br>
shaft 51 caused by the piston, and use just the drive of the<br>
rotating electric machine 20 to run the motorcycle 1.<br>
Note that, in the engine with attached rotating electric<br>
machine 50 of this embodiment, the stator 25 and the rotor 21<br>
are disposed on an extension line of the center axis X of the<br>
crank shaft 51. Thus, size reduction as compared to the known<br>
technology can be promoted in which the rotating electric<br>
machine is connected to the crank shaft using a belt-type<br>
continuously variable transmission or the like.<br>
In addition, in the engine with attached rotating<br>
electric machine 50, because the rotor 21 is disposed further<br>
to the outside in the vehicle width direction than the stator<br>
27<br><br>
25, the cooling fan 65 can be fixed to the rotor 21 and caused<br>
to rotate along with the rotor 21. Thus, a structure is<br>
provided that makes it easier to cool the engine with attached<br>
rotating electric machine 50 while promoting size reduction,<br>
and easier to cool the radiator 66 that is disposed to the<br>
outside in the vehicle width direction of the engine with<br>
attached rotating electric machine 50.<br>
Accordingly, the engine with attached rotating electric<br>
machine 50 is extremely easy to mount.<br>
Moreover, the engine with attached rotating electric<br>
machine 50 has a structure in which the drive mechanism 80 is<br>
attached to the crank case 60, and thus ease of mounting is<br>
improved still further.<br>
In addition, in the engine with attached rotating<br>
electric machine 50, the cap shaped rotor 21 covers the gap<br>
between the rotor 21 and the stator 25, and thus it is difficult<br>
for foreign objects like dirt or the like to enter in to the<br>
gap. Accordingly, durability is substantially improved.<br>
Furthermore, the engine with attached rotating electric<br>
machine 50 has a structure in which the permanent magnets 24<br>
are arranged inside the rotor 21, and thus it is possible to<br>
reliably reduce the size of the gap h in the center axis X<br>
direction between the facing permanent magnets 24 and the<br>
magnetic flux generating area 34a. Accordingly, the<br>
performance of the rotating electric machine 20 can be fully<br>
28<br><br>
demonstrated.<br>
In addition, in the engine with attached rotating<br>
electric machine 50, the gap adjustment mechanism formed by<br>
the above-described first regulation mechanism and the second<br>
regulation mechanism is provided between the crank case 60,<br>
the crank shaft 51, the rotor 21, and the stator 25. Thus, it<br>
is possible to reliably reduce the occurrence of variation in<br>
the gap h in the center axis X direction between the permanent<br>
magnets 24 and the magnetic flux generating area 34a, thereby<br>
allowing the performance of the rotating electric machine 20<br>
to be reliably demonstrated to an even higher level.<br>
In addition, in the engine with attached rotating<br>
electric machine 50, the fixed stator 30, which has a structure<br>
that is more complicated than the moveable stator 40, is fixed<br>
to the crank case 60, and thus the moveable stator 40 can be<br>
provided so as to be rotatable with respect to the crank case<br>
60. Accordingly, the device structure of the engine with<br>
attached rotating electric machine 50 is simplified.<br>
Furthermore, in the engine with attached rotating<br>
electric machine 50, the cooling fan 65 is fixed in an<br>
integrated manner at the outside in the vehicle width direction<br>
of the rotor 21. Thus, the engine with attached rotating<br>
electric machine 50 has a structure that makes it easier to<br>
cool the engine with attached rotating electric machine 50<br>
using the cooling fan 65, and easier to cool the radiator 66<br>
29<br><br>
that is disposed to the outside in the vehicle width direction<br>
of the engine with attached rotating electric machine 50. In<br>
addition, as a result of integrally fixing the cooling fan 65<br>
to the rotor 21 that is lighter than the stator 25, rotational<br>
resistance is reduced.<br>
Moreover, in the engine with attached rotating electric<br>
machine 50, the cooling fan 65 intakes air from the vehicle<br>
width direction side, and blows out air to the outside in the<br>
radial direction with respect to the center axis X. Thus, the<br>
large intake port 66a can be provided in the outside in the<br>
vehicle width direction of the motorcycle 1 in which the engine<br>
with attached rotating electric machine 50 is mounted, thereby<br>
making it easier to intake cool external air and to lead<br>
exhausted air to the outside of the motorcycle 1.<br>
In addition, in the engine with attached rotating<br>
electric machine 50, the radiator 66 is provided at the outside<br>
of the cooling fan 65 in the crank case 60. Moreover, the cool<br>
external air that is sucked in from the outside in the vehicle<br>
width direction by the cooling fan 65 directly hits the radiator<br>
66, thereby improving the cooling effect and improving engine<br>
performance.<br>
Hereinabove, an embodiment of the invention is described.<br>
However, the invention is not limited to this embodiment, and<br>
can be modified and applied as appropriate within the range<br>
implied by the spirit of the invention.<br>

rotating electric machine as claimed in claim 9 or claim 10,<br>
further comprising:<br>
a radiator that is provided in the crank case to the<br>
outside of the fan.<br><br>
An engine with the attached axial gap type rotating electric machine includes a crank case, a rotor, and a stator. A crank shaft, that is driven to rotate around a center axis by a piston, is inserted within the crank case such the crank shaft can rotate. The rotor is fixed to an end section side of the crank shaft at the outside of the crank case, and includes<br>
a plurality of permanent magnets. The stator is fixed to the crank case with the crank shaft inserted therein, and faces the permanent magnets in the center axis direction. The stator<br>
includes a fixed stator that has first teeth, and a moveable stator that has second teeth. A gap between the first teeth and the second teeth that generates magnetic resistance can<br>
be varied by rotating the second teeth around the center axis relative to the first teeth. A drive mechanism is provided that relatively rotates the first stator and the second stator.<br></td>
