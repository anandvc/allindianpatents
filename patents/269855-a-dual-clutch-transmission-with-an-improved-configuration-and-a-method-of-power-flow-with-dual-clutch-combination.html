POWER FLOW CONFIGURATION<br>
FOR DUAL CLUTCH TRANSMISSION MECHANISM<br>
Field<br>
[0001]      The disclosure relates to dual-clutch transmissions and, in particular, to<br>
dual clutch transmissions with an improved configuration and to a method of power<br>
flow using dual clutch transmissions.<br>
Background<br>
[0002] A typical automotive transmission utilizes a common input shaft providing<br>
drive power from an engine to a series of gears (which also may be referred to as<br>
"pinions") located on one or more drive shafts (which also may be referred to as<br>
"layshafts") that are aligned and intermeshed with corresponding gears located on a<br>
parallel output shaft (which also may be referred to as a "countershaft"). Specific<br>
combinations of corresponding pinions on the layshaft and gears on the countershaft<br>
may be selected to provide different gear ratios for transmitting torque at different,<br>
typically overlapping, rotational speed ranges.<br>
[0003] More specifically, the combinations of corresponding pinions and gears<br>
provide gear ratios for transmitting toque and rotation from the engine to downstream<br>
components of a drive train, such as a differential system, and ultimately to wheels<br>
operably connected to the drive train. When the pinion of the layshaft drives the<br>
corresponding gear of the countershaft for rotation, the resultant gear ratio is<br>
commonly referred to by a certain gear number. For example, first gear of the<br>
transmission system can be the result of the gear ratio between a "first gear" pinion<br>
on the layshaft and an intermeshed and corresponding "first gear" gear on the<br>
countershaft. The term gear ratio is used broadly herein to encompass any<br>
reduction in torque or speed between two rotating elements. For example, the term<br>
gear ratio encompasses ratios between gears having intermeshed teeth, and ratios<br>
between sprockets rotated via a common chain.<br>
[0004] For certain transmissions, a pair of co-axially arranged drive or layshafts is<br>
provided. Each of the layshafts selectively transmits torque to a series of pinions,<br>
typically alternating between the layshafts as the diameter of the pinions increases.<br>
The pinions located on the layshaft intermesh with the corresponding gears located<br>
on the countershaft to provide the desired gear ratios.   The countershaft, in turn,<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/086704	PCT/US2006/004872<br>
transmits the torque and rotational speed to the downstream components of the<br>
drive train at the selected gear ratio. In this manner, for example, an odd layshaft<br>
transmits torque and rotation to pinions and gears that may be selected to provide<br>
first, third, and fifth gear ratios, and an even layshaft transmits torque and rotation to<br>
pinions and gears that may be selected to provide second, fourth, and sixth gear<br>
ratios. Hence, the pinions on the layshafts and gears on the output or countershaft<br>
are often referred to by their position in the relative progression of gear ratios<br>
provided by the transmission (i.e., first gear pinion and first gear; second gear pinion<br>
and second gear; etc.).<br>
[0005] Transmissions having co-axially arranged layshafts are often referred to as<br>
dual-clutch transmissions when each of the layshafts is equipped with an<br>
independently-engageable clutch system for selectively engaging and disengaging<br>
the layshafts to supply torque and rotation through selected gear ratios to the<br>
countershaft. The desired combination of pinions and gears to provide the desired<br>
"gear," i.e., gear ratio, is selected through an automatic or manual shifting system.<br>
The clutch systems may be selectively engaged to transfer torque and rotation from<br>
the engine input shaft, through the selected clutch system and layshaft, and through<br>
the selected combination of corresponding pinions and gears to provide torque and<br>
rotational speed to the countershaft, and then to other components of the drive train,<br>
determined by the input shaft torque and speed and the selected gear ratio.<br>
[0006] Upon selection of an intermeshed pinion and gear combination, the<br>
rotational speed of the pinion and/or gear typically must be synchronized with the<br>
rotation of its respective layshaft or countershaft. To facilitate this adjustment, for<br>
example, the countershaft often includes multiple synchronizers that can be<br>
individually activated, such as by using hydraulics, to engage a desired gear of the<br>
countershaft in driving rotation to gradually bring the gear, pinion and/or layshaft to<br>
the same rotational speed as the countershaft. The gear and countershaft are then<br>
locked to prevent further relative rotation. Thus, when a particular gear ratio is<br>
selected, the rotational speed of the countershaft is matched to the speed of the<br>
selected gear of the countershaft which is driven for rotation by the corresponding<br>
pinion located on the selected layshaft.<br>
[0007] The resultant torque and speed of the output shaft or countershaft is<br>
determined by the torque and speed of the common input shaft, modified in the<br>
transmission by the gear ratio between the selected pinion and gear combination.<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/086704	PCT/US2006/004872<br>
For example, to select first gear, the odd layshaft clutch may be engaged to transmit<br>
torque from the input shaft to the odd layshaft. Rotation of the odd layshaft causes<br>
each of the pinions mounted thereon, such as first gear pinion, third gear pinion and<br>
fifth gear pinion, to rotate.<br>
[0008] Rotation of the odd layshaft causes the first gear pinion, third gear pinion,<br>
and fifth gear pinion to drive each of the corresponding gears of the countershaft for<br>
rotation therewith. However, each of the corresponding gears of the countershaft is<br>
allowed to free-wheel relative to the countershaft unless engaged. When first gear is<br>
selected, the synchronizer located on the countershaft and associated with first gear<br>
is activated to engage the first gear with the countershaft for rotation therewith. The<br>
first gear pinion mounted on and driven by the odd layshaft is intermeshed with the<br>
first gear on the countershaft, and thus drives the countershaft through the first gear<br>
rotation, which in turn rotates the drive train. A similar procedure is followed for the<br>
other gears, and this sequence can be reversed to shift from a higher gear (such as<br>
second gear) to a lower gear (such as first gear).<br>
[0009] The transmission is typically located in an engine compartment which also<br>
includes many other components, such as the engine, the radiator and coolant<br>
system, battery, etc. In most modern vehicles, the engine compartment affords little<br>
spare room or space. As a result, the design of a vehicle requires consideration of<br>
the size and geometry of each component to be installed within the engine<br>
compartment. Oftentimes, a pre-determined size and geometry of one or more of<br>
the components results in, or dictates, a particular availability of other components<br>
due to space restrictions within the engine compartment. Furthermore, the design of<br>
the engine compartment and the vehicle body are often influenced by minimal<br>
packaging requirements for the operational components. In some instances, a<br>
savings of 10% of the size and/or weight of the transmission is considered significant<br>
from a commercial standpoint.<br>
[0010] In many dual clutch transmissions, the synchronizers are located on the<br>
countershaft, due to the arrangement of the co-axial layshafts and countershaft and<br>
the desire to minimize the length of the transmissions. For example, this<br>
arrangement can permit the pinions on the layshafts to be more closely spaced than<br>
if the synchronizers were located on the layshafts and between the pinions.<br>
However, such a transmission arrangement has disadvantages.<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/086704	PCT/US2006/004872<br>
[0011] For example, each of the synchronizers must have a capacity sufficient to<br>
transfer torque between the countershaft and the selected gear located on the<br>
countershaft. The required torque capacity of the synchronizers is a function of the<br>
square of the differential speed (w) between the countershaft and the selected gear<br>
prior to their engagement and the rotational inertia of the gear, which in turn is a<br>
function of the diameter of the gear and other factors. The diameter of the gears can<br>
vary depending upon the desired gear ratios. For example, in first gear it often is<br>
desirable to provide to countershaft with a reduction in rotational speed and an<br>
increased torque relative to the torque and speed of the input shaft. In order to<br>
accomplish this, the first gear pinions often are of a small diameter, which is limited<br>
by the diameter of its respective layshaft, and the corresponding first gear on the<br>
countershaft is of very large diameter. The second gear pinion located on the<br>
layshaft typical is of a larger diameter than the first gear pinion, and the second gear<br>
located on the countershaft is of a smaller diameter than the second gear, and so on.<br>
[0012] Due to the comparatively large reduction in speed and increase in torque<br>
desired for the first gear ratio, the synchronizer torque capacity for the first gear of<br>
the countershaft often must be significantly greater than the synchronizer capacities<br>
for the other gears. Because the synchronizer for first gear is mounted on the<br>
countershaft, the synchronizer must have sufficient torque capacity to compensate<br>
the additional torque load imposed by the relatively high gear ratio and rotational<br>
inertia for first gear, which may include reflected inertia from the pinion and layshaft.<br>
In a typical five speed transmission, for example, the gear ratios may be as follows:<br>
4.12 (first gear); 2.17 (second gear); 1.52 (third gear); 1.04 (fourth gear); 0.78 (fifth<br>
gear); and 3.32 (reverse gear).<br>
[0013] In general, the more capacity that is required of the synchronizer, the<br>
larger and more costly the synchronizer is. Therefore, in order to minimize the costs<br>
of such transmissions, a variety of different synchronizers having different capacities<br>
are used. For example, the synchronizers for first gear typically are larger and more<br>
costly than the synchronizers for the other gears, and may be of a different more<br>
complex construction, such as multi-cone synchronizers, raising additional durability<br>
and service issues.<br>
[0014] The arrangement of the pinions and gears, in addition, limits the minimum<br>
diameters (perpendicular to the axes of the layshafts) and the minimum lengths<br>
(parallel to the axes of the layshafts) of the transmission. For example, the diameter<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/086704	PCT/US2006/004872<br>
of the first gear, typically the largest gear diameter, is often a factor that limits efforts<br>
to reduce the diameter of the overall transmission. The number of gears on the<br>
countershaft, in addition, can be a limiting factor on the minimum length of the<br>
transmission, as the gears are typically aligned in series, with a separate<br>
countershaft gear provided for each of the gears of the layshafts for the different<br>
gear ratios.<br>
[0015] Accordingly, it is desired to provide components providing flexibility in the<br>
design, installation, and selection of transmission components installed within the<br>
engine compartment. In particular, it is desired to provide an vehicle transmission<br>
that can be configured to a selected geometry, is reduced in cost and can operate<br>
with a reduced complexity of design constrictions.<br>
Summary<br>
[0016]      A vehicle transmission mechanism and system for transmitting torque<br>
from an engine input shaft to a drive train that is more cost efficient, can be<br>
configured for greater space efficiencies, and provides for reductions in self-apply<br>
force and clutch drag. In one aspect, the system employs a combination of dual<br>
clutches driven at different gear ratios with pinions mounted and engagable with<br>
layshafts driven by the clutches to drive gears on a countershaft at further gear ratios<br>
to provide a less complex, lower cost transmission.<br>
[0017]      In such aspects, the system provides for a durable and cost effective<br>
mechanism for transferring engine torque and rotation to a drive train with the same<br>
effective gear ratios at the countershaft as conventional systems and at reduced<br>
layshaft rotational speeds, and thus reduced clutch drag and clutch self-apply<br>
pressures. Moreover, the system permits the use of pinions sized for more cost<br>
efficient and less complex synchronizers and other engagement systems, and<br>
reduced diameter countershaft gears. The space efficiencies provided by such<br>
aspects of the transmission and system permit the reduction in complexity and cost<br>
of the clutches, the use of interchangeable clutch components, and other more cost<br>
or space efficient arrangements of the clutches, layshafts, countershaft and related<br>
components such as dampers and oil pumps<br>
[0018] In one aspect, the transmission mechanism and system includes an input<br>
shaft from an engine having an engine input drive member, such as a sprocket or<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2006/086704	PCT/US2006/004872<br>
gear, that simultaneously drives a separate first clutch and a second clutch. Each<br>
clutch includes a drive member, such as a sprocket or gear, configured to transfer<br>
torque from the engine input to the input side of the clutch. The engine torque is<br>
transferred at a first gear ratio to the first clutch, and a different, second gear ratio to<br>
the input side of the second clutch.<br>
[0019]      In one aspect, a layshaft is provided for each clutch that is selectively<br>
engageble by the clutch to transfer the engine torque and rotation to the layshaft at<br>
the respective first or second gear ratio. The first clutch is provided with a first or<br>
odd layshaft for the odd numbered transmission gears, e.g. 1st gear, 3rd gear, and<br>
5th gear, which is rotatable about a first layshaft axis. The second or even clutch is<br>
provided with a second layshaft for the even numbered transmission gears, e.g. 2nd<br>
gear, 4th gear, 6th gear, and reverse gear, which is rotatable about a second<br>
layshaft axis. The first layshaft axis is spaced from, and parallel to the second<br>
layshaft axis.<br>
[0020]      Each layshaft, in addition, carries a plurality of coaxially arranged pinions.<br>
A first set of pinions on the first, odd layshaft is for the odd gears, and a second set<br>
of pinions is on the second, even layshaft. The pinions are continuously<br>
intermeshed with and are positioned to drive gears mounted on a countershaft. In<br>
this aspect, the countershaft rotates about an axis parallel to and spaced from both<br>
the first layshaft axis and the second layshaft axis, and the countershaft gears are<br>
coaxially arranged on the countershaft. For each odd transmission gear, a<br>
countershaft gear is intermeshed with and driven by a corresponding pinion from the<br>
first, odd layshaft pinions. For each even transmission gear, a countershaft gear is<br>
continuously intermeshed with and is driven by a pinion from the second, even<br>
layshaft.<br>
[0021]      Each pair of countershaft gears and pinions provide a different gear ratio,<br>
which when combined with the gear ratio provided through one of clutches, supply<br>
the final, effective transmission gear ratios, i.e. the gear ratio supplied through the<br>
countershaft to the drive train for each transmission gear. In this aspect, the<br>
layshafts are independently engagable to transfer rotation and torque at different<br>
gear ratios to each set of pinions, and each pinion within each set is independently<br>
engagable with its corresponding countershaft gear at different gear ratio. Thus, in<br>
this aspect of the dual clutch transmission mechanism, the gear ratios between the<br>
layshaft pinions and the corresponding countershaft gears may be reduced relative<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/086704	PCT/US2006/004872<br>
to those used in conventional transmissions, while providing comparable final,<br>
effective gear ratios.<br>
[0022]      In another aspect, the reduction of the gear ratios supplied by the pinions<br>
and countershaft gears permit an increase in the diameter of pinions, and particularly<br>
for the low gears (i.e. 1st gear, 2nd gear and reverse); this permits the use of a<br>
synchronizer on the layshaft, as opposed to the countershaft. In this aspect, the each<br>
pair of pinions and countershaft gears is engaged by the engagement of the pinion<br>
with its respective layshaft. A layshaft synchronizer is mounted on the each layshaft<br>
to selectively engage one or more pinions. In some applications, the synchronizer is<br>
disposed between adjacent pinions, and is movable in one direction from a neutral<br>
unengaged position to engage one pinion, and in the opposite direction to engage<br>
the other pinion.<br>
[0023]      Each of the synchronizers include a contact portion with a first friction<br>
surface that is oriented to engage a friction surface of a receiving portion on the<br>
pinion. To synchronize the rotation of the layshaft and pinions, the synchronizer<br>
contact portion is progressively moved into frictional contact with the pinion receiving<br>
surface, transferring torque and rotation, until the rotational speed of the layshaft and<br>
pinion are essentially the same, and the pinion is locked in place. The torque<br>
capacity of the synchronizer is sufficient to compensate for gear, pinion and layshaft<br>
inertia, clutch drag and related factors.<br>
[0024]	By moving the synchronizers from the countershaft location typical of<br>
dual clutch transmission to the layshafts, the increase of the torque load on the<br>
synchronizers by a factor of the gear ratio is avoided. As a result, the torque<br>
capacity for the lower gear synchronizers can be substantially reduced relative those<br>
used in conventional dual clutch transmissions. In one aspect, a single cone<br>
synchronizer or one way clutch can be substituted more expensive and more<br>
complex multi-stage synchronizers, or other higher torque capacity systems used in<br>
conventional dual clutch transmissions. In one aspect using the one way clutch, a<br>
hydraulically actuated synchronizer also can be eliminated simplifying the control<br>
system.<br>
[0025]      In another aspect, the selected gear ratios between the engine input and<br>
first and second clutches reduce the rotational speed of the clutches and layshafts<br>
necessary to provide the required torque and rotation transfer to the countershaft.<br>
This speed reduction reduces the clutch drag, and drift-on or self apply speed in the<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/086704	PCT/US2006/004872<br>
clutches, which are functions of the centrifugal force exerted on the fluids used to<br>
cool and operate the clutches as a result of the clutch rotation. The reduction in self-<br>
apply force permits a reduction complexity of the balance systems offsetting the self-<br>
apply force, and the spring force required to off set the self-apply forces. As a result,<br>
the mechanism and system provides additional cost savings and operational<br>
efficiencies.<br>
[0026]      In another aspect, a vehicle transmission mechanism is provided with an<br>
engine input through an engine shaft with two sprockets providing, a separate,<br>
simultaneous sprocket and chain drive to the first, odd clutch and the second even<br>
clutch. The engine input sprockets and clutch drive sprockets each having a number<br>
of sprocket teeth to produce the first gear ratio at the first, odd clutch and a second<br>
gear ratio at the second even clutch.<br>
[0027]      In yet another aspect, the engine input drive, the first clutch drive and<br>
second clutch drive are provided with gears instead of sprockets. An idler gear is<br>
engaged with and driven by the engine input gear and the idler drives the first clutch<br>
gear and first clutch.  A second idler gear is driven by the engine input gear, and<br>
drives the second clutch drive gear. The diameters of the engine input gears and<br>
clutch drive gears provide the first gear ratio with the first, odd clutch and the second<br>
gear ratio for the second, even clutch.<br>
[0028]      In another aspect, a sprocket drive between the engine input and first,<br>
odd clutch at a first upstream gear ratio, and a gear drive between the engine input<br>
and second even clutch is used to provide the second upstream gear ratio. In other<br>
aspects, combinations of upstream sprocket and gear drives are used to drive the<br>
clutches at different gear ratios, including drives where the drive gear or sprocket of<br>
the first clutch may drive the gear or sprocket of the second clutch at a second gear<br>
ratio.<br>
[0029]      In one aspect, alternative reverse gear configurations can be used that<br>
benefit from the reduction of the gear ratios used downstream of the clutches. In<br>
further aspects, the dual clutch mechanism and system disclosed herein permits<br>
very significant flexibility in the arrangement of the, engine input, clutches, layshafts<br>
and countershafts so that other components may be used with the system efficiently.<br>
In such aspects, the first and second layshaft axes may positioned equidistant from<br>
the countershaft axes. A damper may be coaxially interposed between the input<br>
shaft of the engine and the engine input member to dampen vibrations in the input<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2006/086704	PCT/US2006/004872<br>
shaft of the engine. A damper also may be positioned within the transmission<br>
housing supplied with transmission oil flow, i.e. a "wet" environment. A pump drive<br>
may be concentrically mounted on the input shaft of the engine to obtain efficiencies<br>
in the oil supply system.<br>
[0030]      The dual clutch mechanism and system disclosed herein further provides<br>
a method for modifying the transmission components through the selection of gear<br>
ratios upstream of the clutches and downstream of the clutches. Using the flexibility<br>
provided by this system, the cost and operational efficiencies as discussed below<br>
may be used to optimize the transmission construction and operation for specific<br>
applications. Other aspects, advantages and uses of the dual clutch mechanism and<br>
system disclosed herein are discussed below.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
[0054] Referring initially to FIGURE 1, an embodiment of a configuration for a dual<br>
clutch transmission mechanism 10 is depicted. As shown, a first layshaft referred to<br>
herein as the odd layshaft 20 and a second layshaft referred to herein as the even<br>
layshaft 22 are shown as parallel, non-coaxial and side-by-side shafts for receiving<br>
power transmitted from an engine (not shown) of a vehicle. The engine power in the<br>
form of variable torque generated by the engine operation over a range of engine<br>
speeds is transmitted through an engine input shaft 24 (see FIGURE 3) connected to<br>
an input mechanism 26.<br>
[0055] In one aspect of the embodiment, the input mechanism 26 is in the form of<br>
an engine input sprocket 28 and may include a damper 30, as depicted in FIGURE<br>
3, for reducing shock and vibration resulting from erratic or variable power from the<br>
engine, discussed in greater detail below, as well as other components. In the<br>
illustrated embodiment of FIGURE 1, the sprocket 28 is connected to a chain 40,<br>
such as a silent chain, and the chain 40 is connected to a first or odd clutch drive<br>
sprocket 42 and a second or even clutch drive sprocket 44, each respectively<br>
operatively connected to the odd layshaft 20 and the even layshaft 22 through clutch<br>
systems 60, 62, as illustrated in FIGURE 2. In other embodiments, a gear system, a<br>
combination of a gear system and a chain system, a belt, or other power<br>
transmission systems may be used to drive the odd clutch drive sprocket 42 and the<br>
even clutch drive sprocket 44 via the engine input sprocket 28 in order to use the<br>
engine input shaft 24 to drive each of the odd and even layshafts 20, 22, typically<br>
through the clutch systems 60, 62, examples of which input mechanisms 26 are<br>
described in detail below and illustrated in FIGURES 4-12.<br>
[0056] Referring to FIGURES 1 and 2, an output or countershaft 50 is positioned<br>
for communicating with each of the odd and even layshafts 20, 22 via a series of<br>
pinions located on the layshafts 20, 22 and gears located on the countershaft 50 for<br>
transmitting torque and rotational velocity through the drive or power train.<br>
Depending upon which of the clutch systems 60, 62 is engaged to transmit torque<br>
from the respective odd clutch drive sprocket 42 or even clutch drive sprocket 44, the<br>
countershaft 50 may receive power from one or the other of the layshafts 20, 22. In<br>
turn, the countershaft 50 is configured to drive downstream components of the power<br>
train to transmit torque to the wheels of the vehicle to drive the vehicle.<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/086704	PCT/LS2006/004872<br>
[0057] More specifically, in this aspect, a final drive gear 52, as illustrated in<br>
FIGURE 3, is driven for rotation by the countershaft 50. The final drive gear 52<br>
transmits torque to the downstream components of the drive train, such as a<br>
transaxle or a differential. In this aspect, the positioning of the countershaft 50<br>
parallel to and spaced from both of the odd layshaft 20 and the even layshaft 22<br>
advantageously reduces the minimum axial length of the transmission 10 while<br>
permitting the sizing, such as the mean diameter, of the countershaft 50 to provide<br>
sufficient capacity to handle the torque transmitted therethrough. Other alternative<br>
arrangements also may be used where desired, and can be selected depending in<br>
part upon the design constrictions of the compartment of the vehicle where the<br>
transmission mechanism 10 is to be located.<br>
[0058] In the aspect of the transmission mechanism 10 illustrated in FIGURES 1-<br>
3, the axes of rotation of the layshafts 20, 22 are generally equidistant from the axis<br>
of rotation of the countershaft 50. In other arrangements the distances between the<br>
countershaft axis and axes of the layshafts may be modified for particular engine,<br>
power train, and/or engine compartment needs.<br>
[0059] Referring now to FIGURE 2, the odd and even layshafts 20, 22 are<br>
depicted. As can be seen, each layshaft 20, 22 is associated with its respective<br>
clutch systems 60, 62. The odd clutch system 60 is associated with the odd layshaft<br>
20 and the even clutch system 62 is associated with the even layshaft 22. The<br>
control system (not shown) of transmission mechanism 10 allows selective actuation<br>
or engagement of the clutch systems 60, 62 to drive the odd and even shafts 20, 22<br>
for rotation via the engine, and in particular via the engine input shaft 24 and the<br>
input mechanism 26.<br>
[0060] On the upstream side of the clutches 60, 62, the odd clutch system 60<br>
receives power from the engine through the odd clutch drive sprocket 42 with a<br>
predetermined ratio between the odd clutch drive sprocket 42 and the engine input<br>
sprocket 28, while the even clutch system 62 receives power from the engine<br>
through the even clutch drive sprocket 44 with a predetermined ratio between the<br>
even clutch drive sprocket 44 and the engine input sprocket 28. The odd clutch drive<br>
sprocket 42 and the even clutch drive sprocket 44 have different numbers of teeth<br>
and/or different diameters and/or chain pitch radii. Thus, although both the odd<br>
clutch drive sprocket 42 and even clutch drive sprocket 44 are driven for rotation by<br>
the common engine input sprocket 28, the gear ratio between the engine input<br>
13<br><br>
PCT/US2006/004872<br>
WO 2006/086704<br>
sprocket 28 and the odd clutch drive sprocket 42 is different than the gear ratio<br>
between the engine input sprocket 28 and the even clutch drive sprocket 44. This<br>
results in the two clutch systems 60, 62 receiving different torques and rotational<br>
speeds on their input sides.<br>
[0061] Turning now to the downstream side of the clutch systems 60, 62, each<br>
layshaft 20, 22 has a set of pinions intermeshed with corresponding gears on the<br>
output or countershaft 50. There is a gear ratio between each of the pinions of the<br>
layshafts 20, 22 and the corresponding gear of the countershaft 50. The pinions and<br>
corresponding gears may be sequentially utilized according to their gear ratios to<br>
contribute to an effective gear ratio between the engine input shaft 24 and the<br>
countershaft 50, which in turn drives the final drive gear 52. The effective gear ratio<br>
is the product of the upstream gear ratio, i.e., the ratio between the engine input<br>
sprocket 28 and the selected odd or even clutch drive sprocket 42, 44, and the<br>
downstream gear ratio, i.e., the ratio between the selected pinion of a selected one<br>
of the odd or even layshafts 20, 22 and the corresponding gear of the countershaft<br>
50. The rotational speed, which is inversely related to torque, of the countershaft 50<br>
is thus determined by the effective gear ratio.<br>
[0062] On the downstream side of the clutch systems 60, 62, a first gear pinion 70,<br>
third gear pinion 74, and fifth gear pinion 78, as well as a reverse gear pinion 82 are<br>
located on the odd layshaft 20. A second gear pinion 72, fourth gear pinion 76, and<br>
sixth gear pinion 80 are located on the even layshaft 22. The first through sixth gear<br>
pinions 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80 are arranged on the layshafts 20, 22 in generally<br>
alternating fashion so that the transmission 10 can shift the rotational torque and<br>
velocity from one selected and engaged set of gear pinions 70, 72,74, 76,78 and 80<br>
of the layshafts 20, 22 and corresponding gears of the countershaft 50 to the next<br>
(either higher or lower gear ratios) by alternating the selection of gears on the<br>
layshafts 20, 22 and the engagement of the odd and even clutch systems 60, 62<br>
driving the respective odd layshaft 20 and even layshaft 22 for rotation. Because the<br>
gear ratio desired for reverse gear is typically greater than the ratio for second gear<br>
and less than the ratio for first gear, both the first gear pinion 70 and reverse gear<br>
pinion 82 are located on the same layshaft, the odd layshaft 20, in this particular<br>
example.<br>
[0063] Each pinion 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80 and 82 of the layshafts 20, 22 is both<br>
coaxial with and is generally permitted to rotate freely around its respective layshaft<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2006/086704	PCT/US2006/004872<br>
20, 22. To engage the pinion with its layshaft, synchronizers 120 (commonly known<br>
simply as a synchro) engage the pinions to match the speed of the layshaft 20, 22<br>
with the speed of the selected pinion or to match the speed of the selected pinion<br>
with the speed of the respective layshaft 20, 22.<br>
[0064] Each of the synchronizers 120, such as illustrated in FIGURE 2, may have<br>
a spline portion 121 with an inner bore located around the layshaft, either the odd<br>
layshaft 20 or the even layshaft 22. The inner bore of the synchronizer has internal<br>
splines that cooperate with external splines located on the layshaft 20, 22 and<br>
aligned with the inner bore of the synchronizer 120. The synchronizer 120 may shift<br>
along its layshaft 20, 22 with the splines of the inner bore of the synchronizer 120<br>
remaining in engagement with the external splines of the layshaft 20, 22.<br>
Accordingly, the spline portion 121 of the synchronizer 120 rotates with the layshaft<br>
20, 22.<br>
[0065] The synchronizer 120 further has a friction portion 122 that is engageable<br>
and disengageable with the one or more gear pinions 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80 and 82<br>
with which it is associated. For instance, a first synchronizer 123 is provided on the<br>
odd layshaft 20 and is associated with both the first gear pinion 70 and the reverse<br>
gear pinion 82. When the transmission mechanism 10 shifts to the first gear ratio,<br>
the synchronizer 123 is moved toward the first gear pinion 70 so that the friction<br>
portion 122 engages with a corresponding portion of the first gear pinion 70. In<br>
doing so, the first gear pinion 70 is accelerated up to the speed of the odd layshaft<br>
20 while being able to slip if necessary to prevent impulse shocks. That is, the first<br>
gear pinion 70 accelerates up to the rotational velocity of the odd layshaft 20 without<br>
locking the transmission without a signification jolt to the transmission mechanism 10<br>
and thus the vehicle.<br>
[0066] Once the rotational velocity of the first gear pinion 70 has been accelerated<br>
to match that of the odd layshaft 20 (or conversely, the rotational velocity of the odd<br>
layshaft 20 to that of the first gear pinion 70), a collar 121 of the synchronizer 123<br>
(commonly known as a dog collar) shifts into engagement with the first gear pinion<br>
70. The collar 121 also rotates relative to the odd layshaft 20. The collar 121<br>
includes teeth (commonly known as dog teeth) (not shown) that are received within<br>
corresponding indentations of the first gear pinion 70 so that the first gear pinion 70<br>
and the odd layshaft 20 rotate at the same rotational velocity.<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2006/086704	PCT/US2006/004872<br>
[0067] By way of example, synchronizers 120 are provided on the odd and even<br>
layshafts 20, 22 for each of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and reverse gear<br>
pinions 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, and 82. Other examples of arrangements of<br>
synchronizers 120 are set forth in the discussion of FIGURES 14-22. As noted<br>
above, the first synchronizer 123 is located on the odd layshaft 20 for engaging the<br>
first and reverse gear pinions 70, 82 with the odd layshaft 20 for driving rotation<br>
therewith. The first synchronizer 123 shifts between the first and reverse gears<br>
pinions 70, 82 for gear ratio selection and includes one of the respective friction<br>
portions 122 for each of the first and reverse gear pinions 70, 82. Each of the friction<br>
portions 122 of the first synchronizer 123 is in the form of a cup. More specifically,<br>
the first synchronizer 120 is preferably a single cone synchronizer.<br>
[0068] In prior transmission systems, such as those using co-axially arranged odd<br>
and even layshafts, the layshaft or shafts communicates with one or more output or<br>
countershafts comparable to the single countershaft 50 of the transmission<br>
mechanism 10 described herein. In such prior transmission systems, the<br>
synchronizers were typically provided on the countershafts, particularly for the first<br>
gear pinion and the corresponding gear of the countershaft. The diameter of the<br>
layshaft pinion for first gear was necessarily small relative to the diameter to the<br>
countershaft gear to provide the desired first gear (high torque) ratio. In some<br>
instances, the first gear pinion was machined into the layshaft in order to minimize its<br>
diameter. Thus, there was insufficient operating space on the layshaft for a<br>
synchronizer of any type, or, a synchronizer on the layshaft was inappropriate where<br>
the first gear pinion was machined in the layshaft.<br>
[0069] As mentioned above, accelerating and decelerating such countershafts and<br>
countershaft gears to match the rotational velocity of the pinions and layshaft in such<br>
prior transmission systems, accelerating these gears required synchronizers with<br>
significantly greater torque capacities than the arrangement of the present<br>
embodiment of the transmission mechanism 10 utilizing synchronizers 120 on the<br>
layshafts 20, 22, such as the first synchronizer 123, for example, on the odd layshaft<br>
20. In a typical prior transmission system, the synchronizers for the first gear,<br>
second gear, third gear and reverse gear are typically located on the countershaft.<br>
However, as previously mentioned, the gears, and in particular the gears for the<br>
higher gear ratios, such as the first and reverse gear ratios, can have significantly<br>
larger diameters than their corresponding gear pinions located on the layshafts. The<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2006/086704	PCT/US2006/004872<br>
larger diameters of the lower gears located on the countershaft results in an increase<br>
in the rotational inertia of the lower gears, and thus an increased the amount of<br>
torque capacity required to synchronize the lower gears with the countershaft.<br>
[0070] More specifically, the torque capacity required of a synchronizer is a<br>
function of the differential speed between the two gears being synchronized and the<br>
rotational inertia of the gears. For example, when a first gear is selected using a<br>
gear and an associated synchronizer mounted on an output or countershaft of a prior<br>
transmission system, the synchronizer is used to engage the appropriate gear on the<br>
countershaft, which is intermeshed with the corresponding gear pinion located on the<br>
drive or layshaft. To accelerate (or decelerate) the rotation of the layshaft, the torque<br>
and rotation imparted by the synchronizer must be transmitted through the selected<br>
gear of the countershaft and the corresponding and intermeshing gear pinion of the<br>
layshaft. During this process, the rotational inertia from the layshaft is reflected back<br>
to the synchronizer on the countershaft and can be increased by the square of the<br>
gear ratio between the selected gear of the countershaft and the corresponding and<br>
intermeshing gear pinion of the layshaft.<br>
[0071] Thus, for example, where the ratio between the first gear pinion on the<br>
layshaft and the corresponding gear on the countershaft is 1:4, mounting the<br>
synchronizer on the countershaft, as can be typical in prior transmission systems,<br>
would require a torque capacity 16 times greater than the torque capacity required of<br>
a synchronizer 120 located on the odd layshaft 20 for engaging the first gear pinion<br>
70 with the odd layshaft 22 in the configuration of the transmission mechanism 10<br>
disclosed herein and illustrated in FIGURES 1-3.<br>
[0072] One approach to accommodate the high torque demands of other prior<br>
transmission systems were to utilize multipost, relatively complex device for<br>
engaging the gears with the countershaft or more complicated synchronizers having<br>
multi-cone friction portions, such as a triple-cone synchronizer, for the first, reverse<br>
and other relatively high ratio gears. These multi-cone synchronizers require a<br>
series of nested cones with friction surfaces that interact to progressively transfer<br>
torque to a gear or pinion through the interaction between the cones and the<br>
countershaft or layshaft. They require additional, more complex central systems to<br>
ensure their proper operation. Thus, multi-cone synchronizers and other systems to<br>
provide such increased torque capacities are typically more expensive and larger in<br>
size than single-cone synchronizers which often have reduced torque capacities.<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2006/086704	PCT/US2006/004872<br>
[0073] In this aspect of the transmission mechanism 10 disclosed herein and<br>
illustrated in FIGURES 1-3, such multi-cone synchronizers or more complex high<br>
torque capacity systems are not necessary in part because the synchronizers 120<br>
are mounted on the layshafts. In the described embodiments of the dual clutch<br>
transmission mechanism 10, the use of the combined gear ratios both upstream of<br>
the clutch systems 60, 62 and downstream of the clutch systems 60, 62 permits the<br>
use of synchronizers 120 mounted on the layshafts, i.e., the odd layshaft 20 and the<br>
even layshaft 22. This reduces the torque capacity requirements for the<br>
synchronizers 120 as they are not required to overcome the above mentioned<br>
reflected torque, as if located on the countershaft 50. Thus, smaller and simpler<br>
synchronizers, such as single cone synchronizers 120, can be utilized. Thus, the<br>
required torque capacity of the synchronizers 120 is reduced, the cost and size of<br>
the system can be reduced.<br>
[0074] Another advantage of having the synchronizers 120 mounted on the odd<br>
layshaft 20 and the even layshaft 22, as opposed to on the countershaft 50, as can<br>
be typical in prior transmission systems, is that each of the synchronizers 120 can be<br>
the same or have nearly the same operating parameters, such as torque capacity.<br>
In this aspect, the synchronizers 120 are all mounted on the odd layshaft 20 and the<br>
even layshaft 22, as opposed to on the countershaft 50, to reduce the torque<br>
capacity required for all of the synchronizers 120.<br>
[0075] In another aspect, mounting the synchronizers 120 on the odd layshaft 20<br>
and the even layshaft 22, as opposed to on the output or countershaft 50 can<br>
advantageously provide a reduction of the drag torque that the synchronizer 120<br>
must to overcome to accelerate the rotation of the layshafts 20, 22. For example,<br>
where the synchronizers 120 of the transmission mechanism 10, depicted in<br>
FIGURES 1-3, are mounted on the odd layshaft 20 and the even layshaft 22, the<br>
drag torque that must be overcome is generally that of the components of the<br>
respective layshaft 20, 22. However, where a synchronizer is disposed on a<br>
countershaft, as can be typical in prior transmission systems, the drag torque that<br>
the synchronizer must overcome is multiplied by the gear ratio. For example, where<br>
the ratio between the first gear pinion on the layshaft and the corresponding gear on<br>
the countershaft is 1:4, mounting the synchronizer on the countershaft, as opposed<br>
to the layshaft 20 or 22 as in the transmission mechanism 10 disclosed herein, can<br>
increase the torque drag that the synchronizer must overcome by about four times.<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2006/086704	PCT/US2006/004872<br>
[0076] Indeed, because the gear ratios between the gear pinions 70, 72, 74, 76,<br>
78, 80 and 82 of the layshafts 20, 22 and the corresponding gears 100, 102, 104,<br>
106, 108 and 110 of the countershaft 50 are closer together in this aspect than the<br>
gear ratios typically required between similar components of prior transmission<br>
systems, the synchronizers 120 can all be of the same type and have the same<br>
torque capacities. Having such common synchronizers 120 can advantageously<br>
reduce the costs of the transmission mechanism 10 and increase efficiencies in the<br>
assembly of the transmission. Cost reductions can be achieved due to the<br>
elimination of the requirement of different types of synchronizers having different<br>
torque capacities, and the associated costs with increasing the complexity of<br>
assembly and control systems, and stocking of different types of synchronizers.<br>
[0077] In such applications, the center distance between the layshafts 20,22 and<br>
the countershaft 50 may be increased if necessary to provide sufficient space for<br>
larger diameter gear pinions, as well as space for the bearing between the pinion<br>
and the layshaft. In many configurations, however, such an increase is not<br>
necessary as the reduction in diameter of the first gear 100 located on the<br>
countershaft 50 (or other lower gears) will offset the increased diameter of the first<br>
gear pinion 70 (or other lower gears pinions).<br>
[0078] In yet another aspect, having differing gear ratios on the input or upstream<br>
sides of each of the odd and even clutch systems 60, 62 permits reduction of the<br>
range of the rotational speeds required of the odd and even clutch systems 60, 62<br>
relative to the speed of the engine input shaft 26. In this aspect, the input sides of<br>
the odd and even clutch systems 60, 62 having the odd drive sprocket 42 and the<br>
even drive sprocket 44, respectively, are driven at a speed that is reduced by the<br>
gear ratio between the input sprocket 28 and respective odd drive sprocket 42 and<br>
even drive sprocket 44. The result is that the input sides of the clutch systems 60,<br>
62, and thus the clutch systems 60, 62 and the associated odd and even layshafts<br>
20, 22, rotate at reduced speeds as compared to prior transmission systems lacking<br>
the above-discussed differing upstream gear ratios, while the effective gear ratios<br>
between the input shaft 24 and countershaft 50 are maintained at the same levels.<br>
[0079] In this aspect, the construction of the clutch systems 60, 62 also is<br>
simplified, in that the odd clutch system 60 and even clutch system 62 are of very<br>
similar, if not the same, size and capacity and use interchangeable components.<br>
The components of the odd and even clutch systems 60, 62 will be described with<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2006/086704	PCT/US2006/004872<br>
respect to the odd clutch system 60, as depicted in FIGURE 2, with the<br>
understanding that similar or the same components are present in the even clutch<br>
system 62. The odd clutch system 60 includes a plurality of input side clutch plates<br>
92 that are disposed in an alternating relation with a plurality of output side clutch<br>
plates 94. The input side clutch plates 92 are mounted on an input side clutch plate<br>
carrier 96 that is operably connected to be driven for rotation by the odd input<br>
sprocket 42. The output side clutch plates 94 are mounted on an output side clutch<br>
plate carrier 98 that is operable connected to drive the odd layshaft 20 for rotation.<br>
[0080] When it is desired to transmit torque from the odd drive sprocket 42 to the<br>
odd layshaft 20, pressurized hydraulic fluid is directed into an apply chamber 90 of<br>
the odd clutch system 62 via a hydraulic control system (not shown), as is typical for<br>
such clutch system designs. The apply chamber 90 typically contains some<br>
hydraulic fluid. When the pressurized, additional hydraulic fluid fills the apply<br>
chamber 90 with a sufficient pressure to urge the apply piston 93 against one of the<br>
input side clutch plates 92 or output side clutch plates 94, frictionally compressing<br>
the alternating clutch plates 92 and 94 are frictionally compressed together so that<br>
the input side clutch plates 92 drive the output side clutch plates 94 for rotation<br>
therewith.<br>
[0081] In this manner, when the odd clutch system 60 is engaged, torque is<br>
transmitted from the odd drive sprocket 42, to the input side clutch plate carrier 96<br>
and the input side clutch plates 92 mounted thereon, to the alternating, frictionally<br>
engaged output side clutch plates 94 and the output side clutch plate carrier 98 upon<br>
which they are mounted, and finally to the odd layshaft 20 to which the output side<br>
clutch plate carrier 98 is connected.<br>
[0082] In order to prevent the apply piston 93 from prematurely shifting to engage<br>
the input side clutch plates 92 with the output side clutch plates 94, a balance spring<br>
95 is positioned on an opposite side of the apply piston 93 relative to the apply<br>
chamber 90. Due to rotation of the odd clutch 60 in operation, the pressure of the<br>
hydraulic fluid typically in the apply chamber 90 increases due to centrifugal force as<br>
the speed of rotation of the odd clutch system 60 increases. The effect of the<br>
centrifugal force on the hydraulic fluid typically present in the apply chamber 90 is<br>
counteracted by the force exerted on the opposite side of the apply piston 93 by the<br>
balance spring 95, which is sized to exert a biasing force on the apply piston 93<br>
sufficient to prevent the apply piston 93 from prematurely shifting both at low<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2006/086704	PCT/US2006/004872<br>
rotational speeds and increased rotational speeds of the odd clutch system 60.<br>
Thus, to shift the apply piston 93 to engage the input side clutch plates 92 with the<br>
output side clutch plates 94, the fluid pressure in the apply chamber 90 must<br>
overcome the biasing force of the balance spring 95 disposed on the opposite side of<br>
the apply piston 93.<br>
[0083] In one aspect of the transmission mechanism 10 disclosed herein, the<br>
reduced rotational speed of the clutch systems 60, 62 permits a reduction of the<br>
hydraulic fluid pressure requirements necessary to shift each of the apply pistons 93<br>
to engage the input side clutch plates 92 with the output side clutch plates 94 in<br>
order to permit the selected odd and even clutch system 60, 62 to transmit torque<br>
from the respective odd drive sprocket 42 or even drive sprocket 44 to the<br>
corresponding odd or even layshaft 20, 22. This is because lower rotational speeds<br>
of the clutch systems 60, 62 of the present transmission mechanism 10 results in a<br>
decrease in the self-apply pressure of the clutch system 60, 62 due to the reduced<br>
centrifugal force on the fluid in the apply chamber 90.<br>
[0084] The centrifugal force acting on the apply chamber 90 is a function of the<br>
square of the rotational speed of the clutch system 60, 62. Therefore, the lower the<br>
rotational speed of the clutch system 60, 62 in the presently disclosed transmission<br>
mechanism 10 results in a very significant reduction in the maximum self-apply<br>
pressure in the apply chamber 90. This in turn results in proportional reduction in<br>
biasing force of the spring 95 that is selected to counteract the self-apply pressure.<br>
Accordingly, the hydraulic fluid pressure required in the apply chamber 90 to shift the<br>
apply piston 93 to engage the input side clutch plates 92 with the output side clutch<br>
plates 94 is significantly reduced, particularly at lower rotational speeds..<br>
[0085] There are several advantages to having a reduced self-apply pressure and<br>
corresponding reduced fluid pressure required to shift the apply piston 93 to engage<br>
the clutch system 60, 62. One such benefit is that a lighter spring 95 or a spring 95<br>
having a lower spring constant can be utilized, which can reduce the cost of the<br>
transmission. Another advantage is that the maximum hydraulic fluid pressure<br>
required to be provided by the hydraulic fluid supply and control systems (not shown)<br>
is reduced, which can both simplify and reduce the costs of the hydraulic fluid supply<br>
and control systems.<br>
[0086] Yet another advantage is that simplified, i.e., having fewer components,<br>
and less costly clutch systems 60, 62 can be utilized. For example, in certain prior<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2006/086704	PCT/US2006/004872<br>
transmission systems, a balance chamber, which often is the same chamber<br>
containing a balance spring, is provided with a separate supply of hydraulic fluid from<br>
the supply provided to the apply chamber. The balance chamber is configured such<br>
that, as the fluid pressure in the apply chamber increases as a result of the<br>
centrifugal force during the rotation of the clutch system, the fluid in the balance<br>
chamber undergoes a comparable increase in pressure such that the fluid acting on<br>
the apply side of the apply piston is generally balanced by the fluid acting of the<br>
balance side of the apply piston along with the spring force of the balance spring.<br>
However, having a balance chamber supplied with fluid requires a separate fluid flow<br>
path and control system, thereby increasing the complexity of the clutch system for a<br>
prior transmission system having increased rotation speeds of the clutch systems as<br>
compared to the reduced rotational speeds of the clutch systems 60, 62 of the<br>
presently disclosed transmission mechanism 10. The difficulties arising from the<br>
fluid supply systems for conventional dual clutch transmission systems are<br>
discussed in the published application US 2005-0067251.<br>
[0087] The above described use of differing gear ratios upstream of the clutch<br>
systems 60, 62 and the resultant reduced rotational speeds of the clutch systems 60,<br>
62 has the additional benefit of reducing clutch drag in the clutch systems 60, 62.<br>
The clutch systems 60, 62 inherently must overcome drag forces generated by the<br>
differential speed between the input side of the clutch system 60, 62 and the output<br>
side of the clutch system 60, 62. More specifically, clutch drag is inherently<br>
generated due to resistance between fluid surrounding components of the clutch<br>
systems 60, 62 and the components themselves, as well as such as between the<br>
alternating input side clutch plates 92 and outside side clutch plates 94 when they<br>
are not engaged.<br>
[0088] The amount of drag of the clutch system 60, 62 is a function of the fluid<br>
flow rate and the rotational differential between the input side of the clutch system<br>
60, 62 and the output side of the clutch system 60, 62. For example, at higher<br>
rotational speeds on the input side of the clutch system 60, 62 the drag is increased<br>
as compared to the drag at lower rotational speeds on the input side of the clutch<br>
system 60, 62 for comparable fluid flows. Thus, the reduced rotationafspeeds of the<br>
input sides of the clutch systems 60, 62 can result in reduced clutch drag. As<br>
mentioned above, the reduced clutch drag of the clutch systems 60, 62 reduces the<br>
torque requirements for the synchronizers 120.   As previously mentioned, lower<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2006/086704	PCT/US2006/004872<br>
torque capacity requirements for the synchronizers 120 permits the use of<br>
synchronizers 120 that are less costly, smaller sized and of reduced complexity as<br>
compared to synchronizers having higher torque capacities.<br>
[0089] In the aspect of the example of the transmission mechanism 10 shown in<br>
FIGURES 1-3, each of the downstream gear ratios is provided by the ratio between<br>
the pinions 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82 of the odd and even layshafts 20, 22, and their<br>
corresponding gears 100, 102, 104, 106, 108, 110 of the countershaft 50. As<br>
mentioned above, for low gears a higher gear ratio is desired, so the first gear pinion<br>
70, for instance, is relatively small in comparison to its respective gear 100 provided<br>
on the countershaft 50 in order to reduce speed and increase torque of the<br>
countershaft 50. In contrast, the higher gears serve in an opposite manner to<br>
increase speed and reduce torque of the countershaft with respect to the layshafts<br>
20,22.<br>
[0090] Therefore, the highest gear pinions 78, 80 on each layshaft 20, 22 have a<br>
purportedly large diameter relative to the corresponding gear portions (such as 108,<br>
110) mounted on, or even machined into, the countershaft 50. In one aspect, the<br>
diameter and number of teeth of the high gear pinions 78 (fifth gear) and 80 (sixth<br>
gear) and the diameter and number of teeth of the gear 108,110 on the countershaft<br>
50 cooperate to provide the fifth and sixth gear ratios, respectively. Additionally, the<br>
gear ratio between the engine input shaft 24 and each of the odd and even clutch<br>
drive sprockets 42, 44, may be used to provide different upstream gear ratios that, in<br>
conjunction with the downstream gear ratios provided by the pinions 78 and 80 of the<br>
layshafts 20, 22 and the gears 108, 110 of the countershaft 50, provide the desired<br>
effective gear ratios.<br>
[0091] In another aspect, it should be noted that the upstream gear ratios permit<br>
the gears 100, 102, 104 and 108 on the countershaft 50 to correspond to more than<br>
one effective gear ratio in conjunction with a combination of odd and even pinions,<br>
70, 72, 74, 76, 78 and 80. For example, the countershaft gear 100 corresponding to<br>
the first gear pinion 70 (for the first gear ratio) may be the same as that<br>
corresponding with the second gear pinion 72 (for the second gear ratio). As<br>
depicted in FIGURE 2, the fifth gear pinion 78 and sixth gear pinion 80, as well as a<br>
final drive gear 108 of the countershaft 50, which in turn drives the final drive gear,<br>
may utilize the same countershaft gear so that gear portions 108 and 110 machined<br>
or otherwise formed in the countershaft are one and the same.  Also as depicted,<br>
23<br><br>
WO 2006/086704	PCT/US2006/004872<br>
third and fourth gear pinions 74, 76 may share a common gear where gear portions<br>
104 and 106 are one and the same. With reference to FIGURE 1, this sharing<br>
arrangement is achieved by allowing the pinions 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80 and 82 of<br>
each layshaft 20, 22 to approach and communicate with the countershaft 50 from<br>
different directions from each other, as well as from the output drive or final drive<br>
gear 52 from the countershaft 50. Such sharing further reduces the axial length of<br>
the transmission 10 in comparison to prior transmission systems by reducing the<br>
number of gears on the countershafts 50, and can be less expensive and easier to<br>
manufacture.<br>
[0092] As mentioned above, there is a range of particular gear ratios between the<br>
input shaft 24 and the countershaft 50, depending on which gear pinion 70, 72, 74,<br>
76, 78, 80, and 82 and corresponding gear 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110 is<br>
utilized and which clutch system 60,62 is engaged. Thus, the engine in put sprocket<br>
and the odd and even clutch drive sprockets 42, 44 also are selectively sized for a<br>
desired range of gear ratios. That is, the transmission mechanism 10, as described<br>
herein, may be paired with a variety of engine input sprockets 28 and clutch drive<br>
sprockets 42, 44 having different diameters and number of teeth, and thus the<br>
upstream gear ratios may be altered accordingly. This allows the transmission<br>
mechanism 10 to be used in a variety of applications requiring different desired gear.<br>
[0093] This is particularly useful as the first gear pinion 70 on the odd layshaft 20,<br>
for instance, has a minimum required size to avoid mechanical failure, as does the<br>
gear 110 on the countershaft 50. Furthermore, increasing the size of gears located<br>
on the countershaft 50 may otherwise require enlarging the transmission mechanism<br>
10 itself. More specifically, as mentioned above, the pinions associated with the<br>
lower gears, such as the first gear pinion 70, may be larger in the present form as<br>
the pinion 70 and the gear 100 do not require as high of a ratio therebetween, the<br>
effective gear ratio being also determined by the upstream ratio. Furthermore, the<br>
first gear pinion 70 may be sized large enough to accommodate a bearing and/or<br>
one-way clutch between the first gear pinion 70 and the odd layshaft 20.<br>
[0094] It should be appreciated that the clutch systems 60, 62 may be<br>
independently actuated or engaged. Specifically, one of the clutch systems may be<br>
disengaged as the other is engaged so that the layshafts 20, 22 (and gear pinions<br>
70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, and 82) may be sequentially engaged and disengaged. More<br>
specifically, during the time that one of the clutch systems 60, 62 is engaging, but not<br>
24<br><br>
WO 2006/086704	PCT/US2006/004872<br>
fully engaged, the other clutch system 60, 62 may be disengaging while not being<br>
fully disengaged. In other words, the engagement and disengagement of the<br>
respective clutch systems 60, 62 may be, to an extent, simultaneous. In a further<br>
aspect, the layshafts 20, 22 may each be partially engaged to provide a blended<br>
gear ratio.<br>
[0095] Other details of the particular example of the dual clutch transmission<br>
mechanism 10 of FIGURES 1-3 include bearings 46(a-f) and 47(a-g), as indicated<br>
with reference to FIGURE 2. More specifically, each of the odd and even layshafts<br>
20, 22 and the countershaft 50 is supported relative to a housing 48 of the<br>
transmission mechanism 10 by the bearings 46(a-f), as illustrated in FIGURE 2. The<br>
bearings 46, which may comprise thrust bearings, permit the odd and even layshafts<br>
20, 22 and the countershaft 50 to rotate relative to the housing 48 of the<br>
transmission mechanism 10 while at the same time functioning to permit such<br>
rotation to be accomplished with minimal friction. More specifically, a bearing 46a is<br>
positioned adjacent the housing 48 and the even layshaft 22 between an end of the<br>
even layshaft 22, opposite an end of the even layshaft 22 operably connected to the<br>
output side of the even clutch system 62, and the synchronizer 120 associated with<br>
the second gear pinion 72.<br>
[0096] Another bearing 46b is positioned adjacent the housing 48 and the odd<br>
layshaft 20 between the sixth gear pinion 80 and the even input sprocket 44 of the<br>
even clutch system 62. With respect to the countershaft 50, a bearing 46c is<br>
positioned at one end and another bearing 46d is positioned at an opposite end, as<br>
illustrated in FIGURE 2. A bearing 46e is positioned adjacent the housing 48 and<br>
the odd layshaft 20 between an end of the odd layshaft 20, opposite the end of the<br>
odd layshaft 20 operably connected to the output side of the odd clutch system 60,<br>
and the first gear pinion 70. Another bearing 46f is positioned adjacent the housing<br>
48 and the odd layshaft 20 at an end opposite the other bearing 46e, between the<br>
fifth gear pinion 78 and the odd input sprocket 42.<br>
[0097] Each of the gear pinions 70, 72, 74, 76, 78 and 80 of the transmission<br>
mechanism 10 has a bearing 47(a-g), such as a roller bearing, positioned between<br>
the gear pinion 70, 72, 74, 76, 78 and 80 and the respective odd and even layshafts<br>
20, 22, as illustrated in FIGURE 2. The bearings 47(a-g) assist in reducing friction<br>
as the gear pinions 70, 72, 74, 76, 78 and 80 rotate relative to the respective odd<br>
and even layshafts 20, 22 when the gear pinions 70, 72, 74, 76, 78 and 80 are not<br>
25<br><br>
WO 2006/086704	PCT/US2006/004872<br>
engaged for rotation, via the synchronizers 120, with the respective odd and even<br>
layshafts 20, 22, and are being driven for free-wheeling rotation by the respective<br>
intermeshed gears 100, 102, 106 and 108 mounted to the countershaft 50. In order<br>
to further assist in reducing friction, each of the bearings 47 are provided with a flow<br>
of lubricating fluid through flow passages 21 and 23 formed in the odd and even<br>
layshafts 20, 22.<br>
[0098] The transmission 10 operates to transmit power from the engine to the<br>
wheels of a vehicle. The engine itself operates within a range of revolutions per<br>
minute (RPM). If the engine RPM drop below a certain level, the engine will stall.<br>
Conversely, if the engine RPM exceeds a certain level, the engine is susceptible to<br>
damage, and a failing engine can cause damage or injury to as well as beyond the<br>
engine compartment. Accordingly, the transmission 10 operates to allow an output<br>
shaft from the engine (engine input shaft 24 to the transmission 10) to rotate within<br>
the engine operating range.<br>
[0099] The transmission 10 converts the high rotational velocity of the engine input<br>
shaft 24 to an appropriate rotational velocity for accelerating, reducing and/or<br>
maintaining the velocity of the vehicle. During initial movement of the vehicle from<br>
rest or from a low velocity, either in reverse or first gear, a significant force is<br>
required to accelerate the vehicle. More appropriately, acceleration from a low<br>
speed requires a high torque through the drive train. During this acceleration at a<br>
low velocity, the transmission 10 reduces the comparatively high rotational velocity of<br>
the engine input shaft 24 to a lower-velocity, higher-torque rotation transmitted to the<br>
final drive gear 52 via the countershaft 50, using the different gear ratios discussed<br>
herein. Furthermore, the transmission 10 may be used to reverse direction of the<br>
countershaft 50 using a reverse idler gear 112 Positioned between the reverse gear<br>
pinion 82 of the odd layshaft 20 and the reverse gear 54 of the countershaft 50.<br>
[00100] The transmission 10 may be controlled in a variety of manners. That is, a<br>
human operator or a control system, such as a microprocessor-based system, may<br>
monitor vehicular speed (monitored by, for instance, an anti-lock braking system),<br>
engine RPM, or other factors, in order to make a determination that the transmission<br>
mechanism 10 should be shifted. Accordingly and in response to an indication of a<br>
desired shift, the clutch systems 60, 62 may be selectively actuated, and the gear<br>
pinions 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82 may be selectively engaged or disengaged for<br>
rotation with respective layshaft 20, 22.<br>
26<br><br>
WO 2006/086704	PCT/US2006/004872<br>
[00101] Referring now to FIGURES 4 and 5, a further configuration for the input<br>
side of a transmission mechanism 200 is shown having an odd layshaft 202 and an<br>
even layshaft 204 in a parallel, side-by-side arrangement. An engine input shaft 206<br>
includes an input mechanism 208 to provide power to the layshafts 202, 204 from<br>
the engine, and a damper 30 for reducing shock and vibration due to erratic or<br>
variable power from the engine, as will be discussed below. As shown, the input<br>
mechanism 208 includes, among other components, an engine input gear 210<br>
engaged with a pair of spaced apart idler gears 212, 214. Each idler gear 212,214<br>
is further engaged with a respective clutch drive gear 216, 218 connected to the<br>
layshafts 202, 204. In this manner, power is delivered from the engine through the<br>
input shaft 206 and the input mechanism 208 so that the engine input gear 210<br>
rotates both the idler gears 212, 214. The power is then transmitted from the idler<br>
gears 212, 214, to the clutch drive gears 216,218.<br>
[00102] More specifically, the power is transmitted from the idler gears 212, 214<br>
through the clutch drive gears 216, 218 of the respective clutch systems 220, 222 to<br>
the layshafts 202, 204 when one or the other of the clutch systems 220, 222 is<br>
engaged, as can be seen in FIGURE 5. The layshafts 202, 204 are substantially<br>
similar to the layshafts 20, 22, discussed above, in that, although not shown, they<br>
include a plurality of gears pinions corresponding with gears on a countershaft for<br>
providing a series of gear ratios for transmitting torque from the engine to the power<br>
train.<br>
[00103] As shown, the engine input shaft 206 transmits ratio power to each of the<br>
layshafts 202, 204. The engine input gear 210, idler gears 212, 214, and clutch drive<br>
gears 216, 218 each have a specific number of teeth which may be used to provide<br>
an upstream gear ratio therebetween. In the form shown, each of the idler gears<br>
212, 214 and the engine input gear 210 have the same number of teeth and are the<br>
same size so that standard parts may be used for each. The principal manner for<br>
providing the upstream gear ratio between the input shaft 206 and the layshafts 202,<br>
204 is by providing the engine input shaft gear 210 with a different diameter and a<br>
different number of teeth than the clutch drive gears 216, 218. Preferably, each of<br>
the clutch drive gears 216, 218 also has a different number of teeth and size so that<br>
the layshafts 202, 204 have different associated with upstream gear ratios and thus<br>
different rotational speeds.   As an example, the engine input gear 210 and idler<br>
27<br><br>
WO 2006/086704	PCT/US2006/004872<br>
gears 212,214 may each have twenty-six teeth, the clutch drive gear 218 may have<br>
twenty-eight teeth, and the clutch drive gear 216 may have forty teeth.<br>
[00104] With reference to FIGURES 6 and 7, another configuration for the input<br>
side of a transmission mechanism 250 is shown having parallel odd and even<br>
layshafts 252, 254 in a side-by-side arrangement. An engine input shaft 256 is<br>
connected to an input mechanism 258. A damper 30 is provided for reducing shock<br>
and vibration due to erratic or variable power from the engine.<br>
[00105] Engine input gear 260 cooperates and engages with an idler gear 262,<br>
which in turn cooperates and engages with a clutch drive gear 264 operatively<br>
connected through an odd clutch system 270 to an odd layshaft 252 for transmitting<br>
torque from the engine input shaft 256 to the odd layshaft 252. The engine input<br>
mechanism 258 also includes an engine input sprocket 266 which cooperates with a<br>
chain 267, as illustrated in FIGURE 7, to transmit torque to a clutch drive sprocket<br>
268 operatively connected through an even clutch system 272 to the even layshaft<br>
254.<br>
[00106] As can be seen, when the engine input mechanism 258 is connected to the<br>
even layshaft 254 via a chain, both the even layshaft 254 and the engine input shaft<br>
256 rotate in the same direction. In contrast, shafts connected by gears (without<br>
intermediate idler gears) will rotate in opposite directions. Therefore, the idler gear<br>
262 is provided between the engine input gear 260 of the input mechanism 258 and<br>
the clutch drive gear 264 of the odd shaft 252. In this manner, both layshafts 252,<br>
254 are driven in the same rotational direction.<br>
[00107] In the manner discussed above, the engine input shaft 256 transmits power<br>
from the engine through the engine input mechanism 258 including the engine input<br>
gear 260 and the engine input sprocket 266 to the layshafts 252, 254 via the<br>
respective clutch systems 270, 272, as best seen in FIGURE 7. The layshafts 252,<br>
254 are substantially similar to the layshafts 20, 22, discussed above, and include a<br>
series of pinions (not shown) cooperating with a series of gears (not shown) on a<br>
countershaft 274 to provide gear ratios for transmitting torque from the engine to the<br>
power train. Each of the odd and even pinions mounted on the layshafts 252, 254<br>
cooperates with the countershaft 274, similar to the countershaft 50 discussed<br>
above, to transmit power to the final drive gear 52 from the countershaft 274.<br>
[00108] The torque from the engine input shaft 256 is ratioed for each of the<br>
layshafts 252, 254. For the odd layshaft 252, the ratio may be achieved by selecting<br>
28<br><br>
WO 2006/086704	PCT/US2006/004872<br>
the relative numbers of teeth and diameters of each of the engine input gear 260, the<br>
idler gear 262, and the clutch drive gear 264. For the even layshaft 254, the ratio is<br>
achieved by selecting relative numbers of teeth and diameters on the engine input<br>
sprocket 266 and the clutch drive sprocket 268. Each of the ratios between the input<br>
shaft 256 and the odd layshaft 252 and even shaft 254 may be selected to provide a<br>
relative ratio between the odd and even layshafts 252, 254, as desired and as<br>
desired in relation to the embodiments above.<br>
[00109] Turning now to FIGURES 8A-B, an additional configuration for an input<br>
side of a transmission mechanism 300 having parallel odd and even layshafts 302,<br>
304 arranged in a side-by-side manner is depicted for transmitting power from the<br>
engine to a final drive gear 52. An engine input shaft 306 is provided with a damper<br>
30, discussed below, and an input mechanism 308 for communicating power to the<br>
odd and even layshafts 302, 304. As can be seen in comparing FIGURES 8A and<br>
8B, the input mechanism 308 includes an engine input sprocket 310 having first and<br>
second generally identical rows 312, 314 of sprocket teeth 316. The sprocket teeth<br>
rows 312, 314 each drive a separate chain 318 or 320 to transmit torque from the<br>
engine input mechanism 308 and engine input shaft 306 to the layshafts 302, 304<br>
through an odd clutch system and even clutch system (not shown).<br>
[00110] The upstream or input sides of the clutch systems include respective clutch<br>
drive sprockets 330, 332 being driven by the chains 318, 320. More specifically, the<br>
odd layshaft 302 is operatively connected through the odd clutch system to the<br>
sprocket 330 for cooperating with the chain 318, and the even shaft 304 is<br>
operatively connected through the even clutch 355 with clutch drive sprocket 332 for<br>
cooperating with the chain 320. Each of the layshafts 302, 304 receives torque from<br>
the input shaft 306 via the respective clutch systems, as described above, and<br>
transmits the power to a countershaft 340 via pinions on the layshafts 304, 330 and<br>
corresponding gears on the countershaft 340.<br>
[00111] As noted for the previous embodiments, the rotation of the engine input<br>
shaft 306 may be ratioed to the rotation of the odd and even shafts 302, 304. This<br>
may be done by selection of a diameter and number of teeth for the clutch drive<br>
sprockets 330, 332 relative to the same for the rows 312, 314 of teeth 316 of the<br>
engine input mechanism 308. Likewise, a ratio may be provided between the odd<br>
clutch drive sprocket 330 and the even clutch drive sprocket 332 by selecting relative<br>
diameters and numbers of teeth thereof.<br>
29<br><br>
WO 2006/086704	PCT/US2006/004872<br>
[00112] Referring to FIGURES 9 and 10, a configuration of an input side a<br>
transmission mechanism 350 is illustrated having odd and even layshafts 352, 354.<br>
The engine input shaft 356 has an engine input mechanism 358 including, among<br>
other components, an engine input gear 360 and a damper 30. The engine input<br>
gear 360 cooperates with and is engaged with a first idler gear 364 which cooperates<br>
with and is engaged with an odd clutch drive gear 366 operatively connected through<br>
an odd clutch system 353 to the odd layshaft 352. Thus, the odd layshaft 352 and<br>
engine input shaft 356 rotate in the same direction when the odd clutch system 353<br>
is engaged.<br>
[00113] The odd clutch drive gear 366 further is engaged with a second idler gear<br>
368, which is then engaged with an even clutch drive gear 370. The even clutch<br>
drive gear 370 is operatively connected to the even layshaft 354 through the even<br>
clutch system 355. By using the second idler gear 368, each of the odd layshaft<br>
352, engine input shaft 356, and even layshaft 354 rotate in the same direction when<br>
their respective clutch systems 353, 355 are engaged. The layshafts 352, 354 each<br>
carry pinions (not shown) engageable with corresponding gears (not shown)<br>
mounted on a countershaft 380, as has been described for providing downstream<br>
gear ratios, for transmitting torque to the output final drive gear 52. The upstream<br>
ratios, i.e., ratios between the engine input gear 36 and clutch drive gears 366, 370<br>
are obtained by the relative selections of the diameter and numbers of teeth on the<br>
clutch drive gears 366, 370 and the engine input gear 360, as has been described.<br>
[00114] With reference to FIGURES 11 and 12, an input side configuration for a<br>
transmission mechanism 400 is shown utilizing an engine input shaft 406, an odd<br>
layshaft 402, and an even lay shaft 404. As in the transmission mechanism 350, the<br>
engine input shaft 406 transmits power to the odd layshaft 402 through an odd clutch<br>
system 430, which in turn transmits power to the even layshaft 404 through an even<br>
clutch 432 system. The engine input shaft 406 also includes a damper 30 which<br>
reduces vibration transmitted from the engine.<br>
[00115] The engine input shaft 406 includes an engine input mechanism 408<br>
including, among other components, an engine input sprocket 410. The engine input<br>
sprocket 410 transmits torque via a chain 414 to an odd clutch drive sprocket 412<br>
operatively connected with the odd layshaft 402 through the odd clutch 430 system.<br>
The odd layshaft 402 is also connected with an odd clutch drive gear 416, best seen<br>
in FIGURE 12.  The odd clutch drive gear 416 is engaged with an idler gear 420,<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2006/086704	PCT/US2006/004872<br>
which in turn is engaged with an even clutch drive gear 422 operatively connected<br>
through an even clutch system 432 with the even layshaft 404. Thus, torque from<br>
engine input shaft 406 is transmitted via the engine input sprocket 410 to the chain<br>
414 and then to the odd clutch drive sprocket 412. The odd clutch drive sprocket<br>
412 and odd clutch drive gear 416 co-rotate with the odd layshaft 402 so that the odd<br>
clutch drive gear 416 transmits the torque to the idler gear 420 and then to the even<br>
clutch drive gear 422 operatively connected to the even layshaft 404 via the even<br>
clutch system 432. The layshafts 402, 404 are selectively engaged via respective<br>
the clutch systems 430, 432 to transmit the power from the layshafts 402, 404<br>
through their respective pinions (not shown) to the gears (not shown) of a<br>
countershaft 434 to the output final drive gear 52 at selected gear ratios, are<br>
discussed above.<br>
[00116] The upstream gear ratios provided between the engine input shaft 406 and<br>
each of the layshafts 402, 404, which act in combination with the downstream gear<br>
ratios between pinions of the layshafts 402, 404 and the corresponding gears of the<br>
countershaft 432 are determined by the diameter and the relative number of teeth on<br>
the engine input sprocket 410, the clutch drive sprocket 412, the odd drive gear 416,<br>
the idler gear 420, and the even clutch drive gear 422. It should be noted that the<br>
idler gear 420 allows the even and odd layshafts 404, 402 to rotate in the same<br>
direction.<br>
[00117] As has been noted, a damper may be provided with each transmission. In<br>
FIGURE 3, it can be seen that the damper 30 is provided on the input shaft 24 for<br>
reducing the effect of vibration, and shock, due to erratic or variable power from the<br>
engine. As shown, the damper 30 is located on an inboard side of the engine input<br>
shaft 24, that is, inside the transmission mechanism in a position such that the input<br>
mechanism 26 is between the damper 30 and the engine. Similarly, each of the<br>
other transmission mechanisms described herein may be equipped with the damper<br>
30, as is shown. Each of the other previously-described transmissions 200, 250,<br>
300, 350, and 400 are shown with a similar positioning for the damper 30. However,<br>
with reference to FIGURE 13, a damper 450 of a transmission mechanism 448 may<br>
alternatively be located on an engine input shaft 452 so that it is positioned between<br>
the engine and an engine input mechanism 452, depicted as including a engine input<br>
sprocket 454 driving a chain 456.<br>
31<br><br>
WO 2006/086704<br><br>
PCT/US2006/004872<br><br>
[00118] For the configuration of FIGURE 3, for instance, the damper 30 is located<br>
in a so-called wet area. More precisely, the damper 30 is located within a portion of<br>
the transmission mechanism 10 subject to a substantially continuous flow of oil or<br>
other lubricants. In the configuration of the transmission mechanism 448 of FIGURE<br>
13, the damper 450 is located within a portion of the transmission mechanism 448<br>
which is not typically bathed in lubricant and is, thus, referred to as a dry area. As<br>
can be seen, the damper 450 of the transmission mechanism 448 of FIGURE 13 is<br>
comparatively larger than the damper 30 of the transmission mechanism 10 of<br>
FIGURES 1-3. Accordingly, a larger damper, such as damper 450, can be used with<br>
the various transmission mechanisms. A larger damper can allow for use with higher<br>
torque engines to provide the desired levels of torque transmission while still<br>
providing for dampening.<br>
[00119] In selecting among the different configurations for the input sides of<br>
transmission mechanisms, such as those configurations illustrated in FIGURES 1<br>
and 4-12, there are a number of different considerations. For instance,<br>
configurations of the input sides of the transmission mechanisms utilizing gears for<br>
communicating from the engine input shaft to the input sides of the clutch systems<br>
such as those configurations illustrated in FIGURES 4, 5, 9, 10, can be stronger and<br>
can be used with engines running at higher speeds, such as a turbo-charged engine.<br>
The gears also can generally have a longer serviceable life than a chain-and-<br>
sprocket drive configuration.<br>
[00120] However, use of gears in this manner typically requires inclusion of one or<br>
more idler gears to enable the input sides of the clutch systems, and thus the output<br>
sides of the clutch systems and the associated layshafts, to rotate in the same<br>
direction as each other and as the engine input shaft. In other words, a single chain<br>
and a pair of sprockets is generally cost-competitive with a pair of gears, but a pair of<br>
clutch drive gears driven by one or more idler gears is typically more costly than the<br>
chain-and-sprocket arrangement. Therefore, using gears as opposed to sprockets<br>
may lead to an increase in the overall cost of the system. However, any costs<br>
benefits are balanced with other considerations in determining the appropriate input<br>
side configuration of the transmission mechanism.<br>
[00121] Another consideration for selecting among the different configurations of<br>
the input side of the transmission mechanisms is the flexibility provided for<br>
packaging of the transmission ' mechanism in the engine compartment.    As<br>
32<br><br>
WO 2006/086704<br><br>
PCT/US2006/004872<br><br>
discussed, the axial length of the transmission can be shortened in comparison with<br>
other known dual-clutch systems. The relative orientation of the components of the<br>
configurations as shown may be altered to provide a transmission with a different<br>
overall size or geometry, which allows the transmission to be tailored to the space<br>
permitted within the engine compartment by the other components there within.<br>
In some vehicles, the relative positions of a transaxle, the transmission, and the<br>
engine can present configuration, space, and/or other installation issues. The<br>
various transmissions described herein can provide for a varying distance, including<br>
a very small distance, between a centerline of the input shaft and a centerline of the<br>
output drive or final drive gear. The various configurations, then, can allow for the<br>
relative distance between these centerlines to be moved or selected depending upon<br>
the particular design parameters for the application of the transmission mechanism.<br>
[00122] With reference to FIGURE 13, a transmission mechanism 448 is depicted<br>
in a relative orientation with a portion of a transaxle 460 having a differential 462.<br>
The transaxle 460, as depicted, is positioned left-to-right, or port-to-starboard, in an<br>
engine compartment. Accordingly, a constant-velocity (CV) joint 464 is shown for<br>
providing power to a left front wheel of a front wheel drive vehicle. The CV joint 464<br>
is positioned inboard of the left front wheel, and the differential 462 cooperating with<br>
the final drive gear 52 is to the right of the CV joint 464. The final drive gear 52<br>
receives the power from the transmission mechanism 448.<br>
[00123] As shown, the transaxle 460, as well as a number of other components<br>
located in the engine compartment, has minimum operational and installation<br>
requirements. As can be appreciated, the configuration and installation of the<br>
transmission mechanism 448, as well as other transmission mechanisms discussed<br>
herein, benefits from providing options in configuring the transmission mechanism to<br>
allow flexibility in its arrangement in an engine compartment and installation<br>
requirements. For instance, the reduced axial length of the transmission mechanism<br>
448, when compared with prior transmission systems, provides greater flexibility in<br>
locating components to the port or starboard sides of the transmission mechanism<br>
448, and greater flexibility in locating the engine within the engine compartment for<br>
providing input power to the input shaft 451.<br>
[00124] Another example of a dual clutch transmission mechanism 500, having five<br>
forward speeds as opposed to the six forward speeds of the dual clutch transmission<br>
mechanism 10 of FIGURES 1-3, incorporates a one-way clutch 594 between one of<br>
33<br><br>
WO 2006/086704<br><br>
PCT/US2006/004872<br><br>
the pinions. In one example, the first gear pinion 570, and one of the layshafts, in<br>
this example the odd layshaft 520, is illustrated in FIGURES 14-16. The one-way<br>
clutch 594 eliminates a need for a synchronizer 120 to be used for engaging the<br>
associated pinion 570 with the respective input shaft 520, which can reduce the<br>
number of synchronizers 120 that are used in the dual clutch transmission<br>
mechanism 500 and thereby reduce the cost of the transmission mechanism 500.<br>
[00125] As discussed above, prior transmission systems require a first gear pinion<br>
having a very small diameter because the entire first gear ratio is determined by the<br>
ratio between the first gear pinion located on the layshaft and the relatively large<br>
corresponding first gear located on the countershaft. As also discussed above, this<br>
requirement for a minimum diameter first gear pinion has the result that the first gear<br>
pinion is often machined into the layshaft, which certainly would prevent the use of a<br>
one-way clutch between the first gear pinion and the layshaft. The provision in the<br>
present transmission 500 of both gear ratios between the engine input clutch input,<br>
and gear ratios between the layshaft pinions and countershaft gears, working in<br>
combination, permits a reduction in the size disparity between the first gear pinion<br>
570 and the corresponding first gear 552, as also discussed above. Thus, the<br>
diameter of the first gear pinion 570 can be increased by an amount sufficient to<br>
place the one-way clutch 594 between the odd layshaft 520 and the first gear pinion<br>
570.<br>
[00126] In the illustrated example, the one-way clutch 594 includes a portion have<br>
the first gear pinion 570 formed thereon and an adjacent race portion 598. A set of<br>
one-way clutch bearings 596 are positioned between the race portion 598 of the one-<br>
way clutch 594 and the odd layshaft 520. When the input shaft 524 drives both the<br>
odd layshaft 520 and the even layshaft 522 for rotation up to a preselected maximum<br>
rotational speed, the one-way clutch bearings 596 will frictionally engage between<br>
the race portion 598 of the one-way clutch 594 and the odd layshaft 520 to cause the<br>
first gear 570 to be driven for rotation by the odd layshaft 520. Once that<br>
preselected maximum rotational speed is exceeded, the one-way clutch bearings<br>
596 are allowed to free-wheel between the race portion 598 of the one-way clutch<br>
594 and the odd layshaft 520. The first gear 570 is no longer driven for rotation by<br>
the odd layshaft 520, thereby permitting other gears on the odd layshaft 520, such as<br>
third gear 574 and fifth gear 578, to be selectively driven for rotation by the odd<br>
34<br><br>
WO 2006/086704<br><br>
PCT/US2006/004872<br><br>
layshaft 520 and other gear pinions on the even layshaft 522, such as second gear<br>
pinion 582 and fourth gear pinion 576, to be driven for rotation.<br>
[00127] Turning now to more of the details of the dual clutch transmission<br>
mechanism 500 illustrated in FIGURES 14 and 15, a pair of clutch systems 560 and<br>
562 are provided to selectively transfer torque from an engine input shaft 524 to an<br>
odd layshaft 520 and an even layshaft 522 each having a plurality of gear pinions<br>
selectively engageable therewith to be driven for rotation. More specifically, on the<br>
upstream side of the clutch systems 560 and 562, the engine input shaft 524 drives<br>
an engine input sprocket 528 for rotation. A damper 530 is disposed between the<br>
engine input shaft 524 and the engine input sprocket 528 for absorbing vibrations.<br>
Also on the upstream side of the clutches 560 and 562, an odd clutch drive sprocket<br>
542 is connected to the input side of the odd clutch 560 and an even clutch drive<br>
sprocket 544 is connected to the input side of the even clutch 562. The odd clutch<br>
drive sprocket 542 and the even clutch drive sprocket 544 are simultaneously driven<br>
for rotation by the engine input sprocket 528, such as by a chain, gears or a<br>
combination thereof, as discussed above with reference to FIGURES 1 and 4-12.<br>
[00128] On the downstream side of the clutches 560 and 562, the output side of the<br>
odd clutch 560 is engaged with the odd layshaft 520 and the output side of the even<br>
clutch 562 is engaged with the even layshaft 522. Odd gear pinions are positioned<br>
axially along the odd layshaft 520, in this example a first gear pinion 570, third gear<br>
pinion 574 and fifth gear pinion 578. Even gear pinions are positioned axially along<br>
the even layshaft 522, in this example a second gear pinion 572 and fourth gear<br>
pinion 576. In addition, a synchronizer-operated reverse gear pinion 582 is<br>
positioned on the even layshaft 522.<br>
[00129] Each of the gear pinions 570, 572, 576, 574, 578 and 582 is selectively<br>
engageable with its respective layshaft 520 or 522 to be driven for rotation thereby.<br>
As discussed above in greater detail, the first gear pinion 570 is selectively<br>
engageable with the odd layshaft 520 by the one-way clutch 594 to be driven for<br>
rotation thereby when the engine input sprocket 528 is driven for rotation at certain<br>
predetermined rotational speeds. Synchronizers 120, and preferably single cone<br>
synchronizers, are used to engage the other gear pinions 572, 576, 574, 578 and<br>
582 with their respective layshafts 520 or 522 to be driven for rotation thereby. More<br>
specifically, one synchronizer 120 is positioned on the odd layshaft 520 and<br>
selectively can engage either the third gear pinion 574 or the fifth gear pinion 578 for<br>
35<br><br>
WO 2006/086704<br><br>
PCT/US2006/004872<br><br>
rotation with the odd layshaft 520. Two synchronizers 120 are positioned on the<br>
even layshaft 522, one to selectively engage the reverse gear pinion 582 for rotation<br>
with the even layshaft 522 and the other to selectively engage either the second gear<br>
pinion 572 or the fourth gear pinion 576 for rotation with the even layshaft 522.<br>
[00130] A countershaft 550 is non-coaxial and spaced from the odd layshaft 520<br>
and the even layshaft 522. The countershaft 550 has a plurality of driven gears 552,<br>
554 and 556 mounted thereon for rotation therewith. The plurality of driven gears<br>
552, 554 and 556 mounted on the countershaft 550 are each driven for rotation by<br>
one or more of the first gear pinion 570, second gear pinion 572, third gear pinion<br>
574, fourth gear pinion 576 and fifth gear pinion 578 when the gear pinions are<br>
engaged for rotation with the respective odd layshaft 520 or even layshaft 522. The<br>
reverse gear pinion 582 of the even layshaft drives one of the plurality of driven<br>
gears 552, 554 and 556 on the countershaft 550 via an intermediate idler gear 590<br>
mounted for rotation about an idler gear shaft 592. However, there is not necessarily<br>
a separate driven gear 552, 554 and 556 on the countershaft 550 for each of the<br>
gear pinions 570,572, 574, 576,578 and 582.<br>
[00131] Instead, one or more of the driven gears 552, 554 and 556 on the<br>
countershaft 550 is shared by one or more of the gear pinions 570, 572, 574, 576,<br>
578 and 582 on the odd layshaft 520 and the even layshaft 522. For example, first<br>
gear pinion 578 may drive a corresponding first driven gear 552; second gear pinion<br>
572, third gear pinion 574 and reverse gear pinion 582 (via the idler gear 590) may<br>
drive a corresponding common second/third/reverse driven gear 554; and fourth<br>
gear pinion 576 and fifth gear pinion 578 may drive a corresponding common<br>
fourth/fifth driven gear 556. An output gear 532 is driven for rotation by the<br>
fourth/fifth driven gear 556 of the countershaft 550, and in turn drives a transaxle 536<br>
having a differential 534.<br>
[00132] The dual clutch transmission mechanism 500 incorporates a gear ratio both<br>
upstream and downstream of the clutches 560 and 562. More specifically, the<br>
upstream gear ratio for first, third and fifth gears is the ratio between the odd clutch<br>
drive sprocket 542 and the engine input sprocket 528 and upstream gear ratio for the<br>
second, fourth and reverse gears is the ratio between the even clutch drive sprocket<br>
544 and the engine input sprocket 528. The downstream gear ratio for first gear is<br>
the ratio between first gear pinion 570 and the first driven gear 552, for second gear<br>
is the ratio between second gear pinion 572 and the second/third/reverse driven gear<br>
36<br><br>
WO 2006/086704<br><br>
PCT/US2006/004872<br><br>
554, for third gear is the ratio between third gear pinion 574 and the second/third<br>
reverse driven gear 554, for reverse gear is the ratio between the reverse gear<br>
pinion 582 and the second/third/reverse driven gear 554, for fourth gear is the ratio<br>
between the fourth gear pinion 576 and the fourth/fifth driven gear 556, and for fifth<br>
gear is the ratio between the fifth gear pinion 578 and the fourth/fifth driven gear 556.<br>
The effective gear ratio is the multiple of the upstream gear ratio and the<br>
downstream gear ratio for a given gear. By having both the upstream gear ratio and<br>
the downstream gear ratio, some or all of the benefits set forth in detail above can be<br>
achieved.<br>

[00134]  For this example, the upstream gear ratios (the ratio between the odd<br>
clutch drive sprocket 542 or the even clutch drive sprocket 544 and the engine input<br>

sprocket 528), downstream gear ratios (the ratio between the gear pinions 570, 572,<br>
574, 576, 578 and 582 located on the odd layshaft 520 and the even layshaft 522<br>
and the driven gears 552, 554 and 556 mounted on the countershaft 550) and<br>
effective gear ratios at the countershaft may be calculated as follows:<br><br>
Gear	Engine Input-Clutch Drive GearRatio	Layshaft Pinion -Countershaft GearRatio	Effective Ratio<br>
First	1.75	2.29	4.01<br>
Second	2.33	0.93	2.17<br>
Third	1.75	0.87	1.52<br>
Fourth	2.33	0.44	1.02<br>
Fifth	1.75	0.45	0.78<br>
Reverse	2.33	1.42	3.31<br>
[00135] As shown by this example, both the upstream and downstream gear ratios<br>
are much less than the effective gear ratios at the countershaft using the above<br>
assumed sprocket, pinion and gear configurations. Thus, some or all of the benefits<br>
set forth in detail above can be achieved. Similar reductions in the upstream and<br>
downstream gear ratios can be attained with other sprocket or gear, pinion and<br>
countershaft gear configurations, with similar benefits, and at other effective gear<br>
ratios.<br>
[00136] Other aspects of the operation of dual clutch mechanism disclosed herein<br>
can be illustrated by comparison with conventional dual clutch transmissions. For<br>
example, in a conventional dual clutch transmission, the relationship between the<br>
engine input rotational speed and the first, odd layshaft speed when the first, odd<br>
clutch is engaged can be expressed as RL1 = RE, where RL1 is the rotational speed<br>
of first layshaft, and RE is the rotational speed of the engine input. Similarly, the<br>
relationship between the engine input rotational speed and the second, even layshaft<br>
speed when the second, even clutch is engaged be expressed as RL2 = RE, where<br>
RL2 is the rotational speed of the second layshaft. In practice, RL1 and RL2 may<br>
actually be somewhat less than RE due to clutch slippage, drag forces or other<br>
factors that may reduce the efficiency of the transfer of rotational speed between the<br>
engine input and layshafts.<br>
38<br><br>
WO 2006/086704<br><br>
PCT/US2006/004872<br><br>
[00137] The relationship between the engine input rotational speed and the speed<br>
of the countershaft in a conventional dual clutch system at a selected gear with the<br>
clutch and layshaft engaged (subject to the above mentioned transfer inefficiencies)<br>
also can be expressed as Rc = (RE)(RN), where RC is the rotational speed of<br>
countershaft and rn is the gear ratio between the selected pair of layshaft pinions and<br>
countershaft gears, and n is the number of the selected gear (i.e., 1st gear, 2nd gear,<br>
etc.).<br>
[00138] In the transmission mechanisms disclosed herein, such as the transmission<br>
500, the relationship between the countershaft rotational speed and the engine input<br>
for the odd gears can be expressed as Rcodd = (RE)(rnodd)(rL1), and countershaft<br>
rotational speed for the even gears and reverse gear can be expressed RCeven =<br>
(RE)(rneven)(rL2). In these expressions, rL1 is the gear ratio between the engine input<br>
sprocket 528 and the first, odd clutch drive sprocket 42 and rL2 is the gear ratio<br>
between the engine input sprocket 528 and the second, even clutch drive sprocket<br>
44.<br>
39<br>
[00139] Thus, from these relationships the effect of the combination of the<br>
upstream and down stream gear ratios on the reduction of the rotational speed of the<br>
clutch systems 560, 562 and thus the layshafts 520, 522, as discussed above can be<br>
demonstrated. For example, the below table sets forth a range of typical engine<br>
input shaft 526 speeds, expressed in revolutions per minute (RPM), for the different<br>
gears of the transmission mechanism 500 of FIGURES 14-16 as indicated above<br>
and the resultant estimated RPM range of the clutch systems 560, 562 and the<br>
layshafts 520, 522, which is compared with estimated speeds of a typical,<br>
conventional dual clutch transmission system. The speed range for and engine input<br>
shaft in many applications is typically from about 800 to 7700 rpms, and the typical<br>
operating range for may applications is from about 1000 to 4000 rpms.<br><br><br>

[00140] As can be seen by this comparison, the clutch systems 560, 562 and<br>
layshafts 520, 522 of the transmission mechanism 500 of FIGURES 14-16 of the<br>
example rotate at significantly reduced speeds as compared to typical conventional<br>
dual clutch transmission systems, thus permitting some or all of the benefits of<br>
reduced rotations speeds, such as reduced clutch drag and reduced clutch self-apply<br>
forces, to be realized and taken advantage of in designing the transmission<br>
mechanism 500 for particular applications.<br>
40<br><br>
WO 2006/086704<br><br>
PCT/US2006/004872<br><br>
[00141] The example also can illustrate the significant reduction in the self-apply<br>
force and clutch drag torque experienced by the clutches of the transmission<br>
systems disclosed herein. The self-apply force is a function of the rotational speed<br>
of the clutch, which can be expressed as Self-Apply Force = f(Rclutch2)&gt; where Rclutch is<br>
the rotational speed of the first odd, or second, even clutch (which also is<br>
approximately the same as RL1 or RL2 as discussed above). Accordingly, reducing<br>
the clutch rotational speed by a factor of 1.75 at the high end of the rotational speeds<br>
of the example in first gear, would result in a reduction by a factor of 1.752, or 67%<br>
of the clutch self apply force relative to conventional systems (all other variables<br>
remaining constant). Similarly, reducing the clutch rotational speed by a factor of<br>
1.75 at the high end of the rotational speeds of the example in fifth gear, would result<br>
in a reduction by a factor of 1.752 , or 67% relative to conventional systems. The<br>
even gears in this example would have clutch self apply force that is reduced by<br>
2.332, or by 82%.<br>
[00142] Thus, the compensating clutch balance force required to offset that self<br>
apply force, which must compensate for the greatest self apply forces, can be<br>
proportionally reduced. As discussed above, this permits the reduction of the<br>
complexity of design, parts and operation of the clutch systems for the transmission<br>
mechanism disclosed herein through the use of balance springs with reduced spring<br>
force or constants.<br>
[00143] Clutch drag, Dclutch, is a function of several factors relating to the clutch<br>
construction and materials, oil flow, clutch operating conditions, and other such<br>
factors. The relationship between clutch rotational speed and clutch drag can be<br>
expressed as Dclutch = f(Rclutch,q), where q = oil flow rate. Accordingly, a reduction in<br>
clutch rotational speed by a factor of 1.75 at the high end of the rotational speeds of<br>
the example in first gear, would result in a reduction of the clutch drag by about 43%<br>
relative to conventional systems (all other variables remaining constant). Similarly,<br>
reducing the clutch rotational by a factor of 1.75 at the high end of the rotational<br>
speeds of the example in fifth gear, would result in a reduction by 43% relative to<br>
conventional systems. Similarly, the clutch drag of the even clutch would be reduced<br>
by a factor of 2.33, which is about a 57% reduction.<br>
[00144] The example above also may be used to illustrate the benefits of deploying<br>
synchronizers on the layshafts of the transmission mechanism disclosed herein,<br>
rather than on the countershaft as in conventional systems. The synchronizer torque<br>
41<br><br>
WO 2006/086704<br><br>
PCT/US2006/004872<br><br>
capacity required in a system such as the transmission mechanism 500 is a function<br>
of several variables which will depend on the specific construction and operation of<br>
the system. The relationship between several important variables can be expressed<br>
as Synchronizer Torque Capacity = f(l, w2, t, D ). Where w = differential speed<br>
between the gear or pinion and the respective shaft (countershaft or layshaft); I =<br>
rotational inertia that the synchronizer must overcome; t = the desired synchronizing<br>
time; and D = system drag.<br>
[00145] As discussed above, in conventional dual clutch transmission systems<br>
where the first gear synchronizer is mounted on the countershaft, the rotational<br>
inertia reflected back from the layshaft is a function of the square of the gear ratio or<br>
rn2. Accordingly the torque capacity required of the synchronizer can be reduced by a<br>
proportionate amount relative to conventional systems in the aspects of the<br>
transmission mechanisms disclosed herein where the synchronizer is deployed on a<br>
layshaft, such as the first, odd layshaft. In the above example, the gear ratio for first<br>
gear is r1st = 4.01, and thus the required first gear synchronizer torque capacity<br>
would be decreased by a factor 4.012 or 16.08, relative to conventional systems. For<br>
the reverse gear of the example with a gear ratio of rreverse = 3.31, employing the<br>
synchronizer on the corresponding layshaft permits a reduction of the synchronizer<br>
torque capacity by a factor of 3.312 or 10.96.<br>
[00146] In a similar fashion, the clutch drag torque, Dclutch, for the clutch system of<br>
each layshaft in conventional systems is reflected through the gear ratio between the<br>
intermeshed layshaft pinions and countershaft gears. The synchronizer torque<br>
capacity to compensate for Dclutch, in such conventional systems therefore also is<br>
increased by a factor of rn. In the aspects of the transmission mechanism herein<br>
employing a synchronizer on the layshafts, the reduction in the synchronizer torque<br>
capacity necessary to compensate for Dclutch can be reduced by a factor of rn, relative<br>
to the conventional systems, which in the above example for first gear is a factor of<br>
4.01.<br>
[00147] Suitable diameters for the pinions (DP) and gears (DG) in the above<br>
example can be determined by the desired ratio between the pinions and gears (rn).<br>
For example, for a given gear diameter for first gear (DG1), the corresponding<br>
diameter of the first gear pinion (DP1) is determined by the following formula: DP1 =<br>
DG1 / r1. In the above example where the desired effective gear ratio is 4.01, the first<br>
gear ratio is 2.29, that is, where the first gear pinion rotates 2.29 times for each<br>
42<br><br>
WO 2006/086704<br><br>
PCT/US2006/004872<br><br>
rotation of the first gear, the diameter of the first gear pinion DP1 is determined by DG1<br>
/ 2.29, or about 40% (about 2/5) of the diameter of the first gear. In prior<br>
transmission systems lacking an upstream gear ratio, the effective gear ratio is<br>
determined entirely by the gear ratio between the pinion and gear. For comparison<br>
purposes, to achieve a gear ratio of 4.01 for first gear, the pinion would have to have<br>
a diameter that is about 25% of the diameter of the corresponding first gear.<br>
[00148] Thus, the presently disclosed transmission mechanism having an upstream<br>
gear ratio and a downstream gear ratio can have the above-discussed benefit of<br>
having a first gear pinion, and other pinions, that has a larger diameter as compared<br>
to the diameter of such a pinion in prior transmission systems. For instance, the<br>
larger first gear pinion permits of the present transmission mechanism permits a<br>
bearing to be inserted between the pinion and the corresponding layshaft, which in<br>
turn permits a synchronizer to be mounted on the layshaft to select that pinion for<br>
driving rotation.<br>
[00149] As discussed above with respect to the descriptions of FIGURE 1, a single<br>
chain 40 may be used to simultaneously drive the odd clutch drive sprocket 542 and<br>
the even clutch drive sprocket 544 using the engine input sprocket 528. One<br>
example of a suitable chain for use in the dual clutch transmission mechanism 500 of<br>
EXAMPLE 1 has 94 links, is about 20 mm wide, and has a pitch of about 8 mm. In<br>
this example, the center of the odd clutch input sprocket 542 is spaced about 108<br>
mm from the center of the engine input sprocket 528, the center of the even input<br>
sprocket 544 is spaced about 218 mm from the center of the engine input sprocket<br>
528 and the center of the even clutch drive sprocket 544 is spaced about 128 mm<br>
from the center of the odd clutch drive sprocket 542.<br>
[00150] Another example of a configuration of a dual clutch transmission<br>
mechanism 600 is illustrated in FIGURES 18 and 19. This transmission mechanism<br>
is similar in construction to the transmission mechanism of FIGURES 14-16, but<br>
primarily differs in that it has a sliding reverse gear idler 692 instead of being<br>
synchronizer-operated. The reduction of the number of synchronizers 120 can<br>
reduce the cost of the transmission mechanism 600. Other differences will be<br>
apparent from the discussion herein.<br>
[00151] The transmission mechanism 600 has an engine input shaft 624, an odd<br>
layshaft 620, and even layshaft 622 and a countershaft 650. The axes of each of<br>
these shafts 624, 620, 622 and 650 are non-coaxial and parallel with one another.<br>
43<br><br>
WO 2006/086704<br><br>
PCT/US2006/004872<br><br>
An odd clutch system 660 and an even clutch system 662 are provided and are each<br>
separately engageable for purposes that will be discussed in greater detail.<br>
[00152] On the upstream side of the clutch systems 660, 662, a chain 640 drives an<br>
odd clutch drive sprocket 642 and an even clutch drive sprocket 44 for rotation via an<br>
engine input sprocket 628 mounted to the engine input shaft 624. The ratio between<br>
the odd clutch drive sprocket 642 and the engine input sprocket 628 is different than<br>
the ratio between the even clutch drive sprocket 644 and the engine input sprocket<br>
628. The drive or upstream side of the odd clutch system 660 is operatively<br>
connected to the odd clutch drive sprocket 642 and is driven for rotation thereby.<br>
Similarly, the drive or upstream side of the even clutch system 662 is operatively<br>
connected to the even clutch drive sprocket 644 and is driven for rotation thereby.<br>
[00153] Turning now to the downstream side of the clutch systems 660, 662, the<br>
downstream or output side of the odd clutch system 660 is operatively connected to<br>
the odd layshaft 620 and the downstream or output side of the even clutch system<br>
662 is operatively connected to the even layshaft 622. When the odd clutch system<br>
660 is engaged, torque is transmitted from the odd clutch drive sprocket 642,<br>
through the odd clutch system 660, and to the odd layshaft 620. Similarly, when the<br>
even clutch system 662 is engaged, torque is transmitted from the even clutch drive<br>
sprocket 644, through the even clutch system 662, and to the even layshaft 662.<br>
[00154] Located on the odd layshaft 620 is a first gear pinion 670, a third gear<br>
pinion 674 and a fifth gear pinion 678. A one-way clutch 694 is positioned to engage<br>
the first gear pinion 670 for rotation with the odd layshaft 620. A synchronizer 120 is<br>
located on the odd layshaft 620 and is positioned between the third gear pinion 674<br>
and the fifth gear pinion 678 for selective engagement of the pinion 674 or 678 with<br>
the odd layshaft 620. Located on the even layshaft 622 is a second gear pinion 672,<br>
a fourth gear pinion 676 and a reverse gear pinion 682. A synchronizer 120 is<br>
located on the even layshaft 622 and is positioned between the second gear pinion<br>
672 and the fourth gear pinion 676 to selectively engage one of the pinions 672 or<br>
676 with the even layshaft 622 for rotation therewith. The reverse gear pinion 682 is<br>
mounted to the even layshaft 622. A reverse gear idler 690 is rotatable about an<br>
idler shaft 692. The reverse gear idler 690 is selectively slidable along the reverse<br>
gear pinion 682 between a first position and a second position. The reverse gear<br>
idler 690 may be slid between the first position and the second position in a variety of<br>
44<br><br>
WO 2006/086704<br><br>
PCT/US2006/004872<br><br>
manners, including via a hydraulically, mechanically or electronically actuated fork or<br>
lever arm (not shown).<br>
[00155] The countershaft 650 has a first/reverse driven gear 652, a second driven<br>
gear 654, a third/fourth driven gear 656 and a fifth driven gear 658. The first/reverse<br>
driven gear 652 is aligned with first gear pinion 670 and the reverse idler gear 690<br>
when the reverse idler gear is in the second position. The first/reverse driven gear<br>
652 is not aligned with the reverse idler gear 690 when the reverse idler gear is in<br>
the first position. The second driven gear 654 is aligned with the second gear pinion<br>
672, the third/fourth driven gear 656 is aligned with the third gear pinion 674 and the<br>
fourth gear pinion 676, and the fifth driven gear 658 is aligned with the fifth gear<br>
pinion 678. The fifth driven gear 658 also functions as a final drive gear, and is<br>
aligned with an output gear 632, which in turn is coupled to the housing of a<br>
differential system 634 and drives the same for rotation.<br>
[00156] Different downstream gear ratios are present between the various gear<br>
pinions 670, 672, 674, 676, 678 and 682 of the layshafts 620, 622 and the aligned<br>
driven gears 652, 654, 656 and 658 of the countershaft 650. The gear ratio is<br>
determined by which of the clutch systems 660, 662 is engaged to drive which of the<br>
layshafts 620, 622, and which of the gear pinions 672, 674, 676, 678 and 682 is<br>
engaged with the respective layshaft 620, 622. The product of these downstream<br>
gear ratios and the upstream gear ratios results in a total effective gear ratio for the<br>
transmission mechanism 600 dependent upon which gear, i.e., first, second, third,<br>
fourth, fifth, or reverse, is selected.<br>
[00157] In another example, illustrated in FIGURE 20, a dual clutch transmission<br>
mechanism 700 is disclosed that has six forward speeds and a reverse speed that is<br>
activated via a sliding reverse idler gear 790. The transmission mechanism 700<br>
includes an odd clutch system 760 and an even clutch system 762, the functions of<br>
which will be described in greater detail. On the upstream side of the clutch systems<br>
760, 762, an engine input sprocket (not shown) drives both an odd clutch drive<br>
sprocket 742 and an even clutch drive sprocket 744 for rotation via a chain 740. The<br>
odd clutch drive sprocket 742 is operably connected to drive the input side of the odd<br>
clutch system 760, and the even clutch drive sprocket 744 is operably connected to<br>
drive the input side of the even clutch system 762. The ratio between the engine<br>
input sprocket and the odd clutch drive sprocket 742 is different than the ratio<br>
between the engine input sprocket and the even clutch drive sprocket 744.<br>
45<br><br>
WO 2006/086704<br><br>
PCT/US2006/004872<br><br>
[00158] On the downstream side of the clutch systems 760, 762, an odd layshaft<br>
720 is driven for rotation by the output side of the odd clutch system 760 and an<br>
input layshaft 722. A first gear pinion 770, a third gear pinion 774 and a fifth gear<br>
pinion 778 are located on the odd layshaft 720. A one-way clutch 794, having a<br>
construction and operation similar to that described above with respect to the<br>
transmission mechanism 500 of FIGURES 14-16, selectively engages the first gear<br>
pinion 770 for rotation with the odd layshaft 720. A synchronizer 120 is located on<br>
the odd layshaft 720 and is positioned between the third gear pinion 774 and the fifth<br>
gear pinion 778 for selectively engaging one of these pinions 774 and 778 for<br>
rotation with the odd layshaft 720. A second gear pinion 772, a fourth gear pinion<br>
776 and a sixth gear pinion 780 are located on the even layshaft 722.<br>
[00159] A synchronizer 120 is located on the even layshaft 722 and selectively can<br>
engage the second gear pinion 772 with the even layshaft 722 for rotation therewith.<br>
Another synchronizer 120 is also located on the even layshaft 722 and is positioned<br>
between the fourth gear pinion 776 and the sixth gear pinion 780 for selectively<br>
engaging one of these pinions 776 and 780 for rotation with the even layshaft 722. A<br>
reverse gear pinion 782 is integrally formed with the even layshaft 722 and is<br>
intermeshed with the reverse idler gear 790 which is adapted to rotate about an idler<br>
shaft 792. The length of the reverse gear pinion 782 is larger than that of the width<br>
of the reverse idler gear 790 such that the gear 790 can be slid, such as using the<br>
means set forth above with respect to the transmission mechanism 600 of FIGURES<br>
18 and 19, from a first position to a second position, as will be described in further<br>
detail.<br>
[00160] A countershaft 750 is orientated parallel to and spaced from the odd and<br>
even layshafts 720, 722. A first/reverse gear 752, second gear 754, third/fourth gear<br>
756 and fifth/sixth gear 758 are mounted to the countershaft 750. The first/reverse<br>
gear 752 is aligned to be driven by the first gear pinion 770 or the reverse idler gear<br>
790 in the second position, but not the first position. The second gear 754 is aligned<br>
to be driven by the second gear pinion 772. The third/fourth gear 756 is aligned to<br>
be driven by either the third gear pinion 774, when the odd clutch system 760 is<br>
engaged to rotate the odd layshaft 720, or the fourth gear pinion 776, when the even<br>
clutch system 762 is engaged to rotate the even layshaft 722. The fifth/sixth gear<br>
758, which also functions as the final drive gear, is aligned to be driven by either the<br>
fifth gear pinion 778, when the odd clutch system 760 is engaged to rotate the odd<br>
46<br><br>
WO 2006/086704<br><br>
PCT/US2006/004872<br><br>
layshaft 720, or the sixth gear pinion 780, when the even clutch system 762 is<br>
engaged to rotate the even layshaft 722.<br>
[00161] Each of the combinations of the gears 752, 754, 756 and 758 of the<br>
countershaft 750 and the pinions 770, 772, 774, 776, 778, 780 and 782 have a<br>
different downstream gear ratio. The downstream gear ratio is multiplied by with the<br>
upstream sprocket ratio, between either the engine input sprocket and the odd clutch<br>
drive sprocket 742 for the odd gears or the engine input sprocket and the even clutch<br>
drive sprocket 744 for the even and reverse gears, to produce an effective gear ratio<br>
of the transmission mechanism 700.<br>
[00162] In yet another example, illustrated in FIGURE 21, a dual clutch<br>
transmission mechanism 800 is provided that has five forward speeds and a<br>
synchronizer-operated reverse gear and first gear. The transmission mechanism<br>
800 includes an odd clutch system 860 and an even clutch system 862, the functions<br>
of which will be described in greater detail. On the upstream side of the clutch<br>
systems 860, 862, an engine input sprocket (not shown) drives both an odd clutch<br>
drive sprocket 842 and an even clutch drive sprocket 844 for rotation via a chain<br>
840. The odd clutch drive sprocket 842 is operably connected to drive the input side<br>
of the odd clutch system 860, and the even clutch drive sprocket 844 is operably<br>
connected to drive the input side of the even clutch system 862. The ratio between<br>
the engine input sprocket and the odd clutch drive sprocket 842 is different than the<br>
ratio between the engine input sprocket and the even clutch drive input sprocket 844.<br>
[00163] On the downstream side of the clutch systems 860, 862, an odd layshaft<br>
820 is driven for rotation by the output side of the odd clutch system 860 and an<br>

[00164] A countershaft 850 is orientated parallel to and spaced from the odd and<br>
even layshafts 820, 822. A first gear 852, second/reverse gear 854, third/fourth gear<br>
856 and fifth gear 858 are mounted to the countershaft 850. The first gear 852 is<br>
aligned to be driven by the first gear pinion 870. The second/reverse gear 854 is<br>
aligned to be driven by the second gear pinion 872 or the reverse gear pinion 882 via<br>
a reverse idler gear (not shown). The third/fourth gear 856 is aligned to be driven by<br>
either the third gear pinion 874, when the odd clutch system 860 is engaged to rotate<br>
the odd layshaft 820, or the fourth gear pinion 876, when the even clutch system 862<br>
is engaged to rotate the even layshaft 822. The fifth gear 858, which also functions<br>
as the final drive gear, is aligned to be driven by the fifth gear pinion 878.<br>
[00165] Each of the combinations of the gears 852, 854, 856 and 858 of the<br>
countershaft 850 and the pinions 870, 872, 874, 876, 878 and 882 have a different<br>
downstream gear ratio. The downstream gear ratio is multiplied by with the<br>
upstream sprocket ratio, between either the engine input sprocket and the odd clutch<br>
drive sprocket 842 for the odd gears or the input sprocket and the even clutch drive<br>
sprocket 844 for the even and reverse gears, to produce an effective gear ratio of the<br>
transmission mechanism 800.<br>
[00166] In another example, illustrated in FIGURE 22, a transmission mechanism<br>
900 is disclosed that has five forward speeds and a reverse speed. The<br>
transmission mechanism 900 further has a one-way clutch 994 associated with a first<br>
gear pinion 970 and a planetary gear system 992 associated with a reverse gear<br>
pinion 982, as will be discussed in greater detail. The transmission mechanism 900<br>
includes an odd clutch system 960 and an even clutch system 962, the functions of<br>
which will be described in greater detail. On the upstream side of the clutch systems<br>
960, 962, an engine input sprocket (not shown) drives both an odd clutch drive<br>
sprocket 942 and an even clutch drive sprocket 944 for rotation via a chain 940. The<br>
odd clutch drive sprocket 942 is operably connected to drive the input side of the odd<br>
clutch system 960, and the even clutch drive sprocket 944 is operably connected to<br>
drive the input side of the even clutch system 962. The ratio between the engine<br>
sprocket and the odd clutch drive sprocket 942 is different than the ratio between the<br>
engine input sprocket and the even clutch drive input sprocket 944.<br>
[00167] On the downstream side of the clutch systems 960, 962, an odd layshaft<br>
920 is driven for rotation by the output side of the odd clutch system 960 and an<br>
input layshaft 922. The first gear pinion 970, a third gear pinion 974 and a fifth gear<br>

pinion 978 are located on the odd layshaft 920. The one-way clutch 994, having a<br>
construction and operation similar to that described above with respect to the<br>
transmission mechanism 500 of FIGURES 14-16, selectively engages the first gear<br>
pinion 970 for rotation with the odd layshaft 920. A synchronizer 120 is located on<br>
the odd layshaft 920 and is positioned between the third gear pinion 974 and the fifth<br>
gear pinion 978. This synchronizer 120 can selectively engage one of the third gear<br>
and fifth gear pinions 974 and 978 for rotation with the odd layshaft 920.<br>
[00168] A second gear pinion 972, a fourth gear pinion 976 and the reverse gear<br>
pinion 982 are located on the even layshaft 922. A synchronizer 120 is located on<br>
the even layshaft 922 and selectively can engage either the second gear pinion 972<br>
or the fourth gear pinion 976 for selectively engaging one of these pinions 972 and<br>
976 for rotation with the even layshaft 922. The reverse gear pinion 982, also<br>
located on the even layshaft 922, is associated with the planetary gear system 992.<br>
[00169] The planetary gear system 992 includes a centrally-located sun gear 966,<br>
which is integrally formed with the even layshaft 922, one or more planet gears 996,<br>
which in turn is surrounded by a ring gear 964. When the ring gear 964 is engaged,<br>
such as by using a band, dog clutch or friction clutch (not shown), it is locked relative<br>
to a housing 998 of the transmission system 900. This in turn causes the sun gear<br>
966 to rotate the planet gear 964, which is connected to the reverse gear pinion 982<br>
for driving rotation. The reverse gear pinion 982 then drives a final drive gear 990 for<br>
rotation via the outer circumference thereof.<br>
[00170] A countershaft 950 is orientated parallel to and spaced from the odd and<br>
even layshafts 920, 922. A first gear 952, second gear 954, third/fourth gear 956<br>
and fifth gear 958 are mounted to the countershaft 950. The first gear 952 is aligned<br>
to be driven by the first gear pinion 970. The second gear 954 is aligned to be driven<br>
by the second gear pinion 972. The third/fourth gear 956 is aligned to be driven by<br>
either the third gear pinion 974, when the odd clutch system 960 is engaged to rotate<br>
the odd layshaft 920, or the fourth gear pinion 976, when the even clutch system 962<br>
is engaged to rotate the even layshaft 922. The fifth gear 958 is aligned to be driven<br>
by either the fifth gear pinion 978, when the odd clutch system 960 is engaged to<br>
rotate the odd layshaft 920, or the inner circumference of the final idler gear 990, via<br>
the reverse gear pinion 982, when the even clutch system 962 is engaged to rotate<br>
the even layshaft 922 and the reverse gear pinion 982 is driven for rotation by the<br>
planetary gear system 992.<br>
