TITLE<br>
"DIESEL FUEL COMPOSITIONS" APPLICANT<br>
SHELL INTERNATIONALE RESEARCH MAATSCHAPPIJ B.V.<br>
Carel van Bylandtlaan 30<br>
NL-2596 HR The Hague The Netherlands<br>
Nationality : a Dutch company<br>
The following specification particularly describes	.   .<br>
the nature of this invention'and the manner in which<br>
it is to be performed<br><br>
DIESEL FUEL COMPOSITIONS<br>
The present invention relates to diesel fuel compositions, their preparation and their use in compression ignition engines, and to the use of certain types of fuel in diesel fuel compositions.<br>
It has been found that Fischer-Tropsch derived fuels can contribute to an improvement in the responsiveness of a compression ignition engine and/or a vehicle which is powered by such an engine.  A fuel composition containing such components can therefore be used to help improve the performance, particularly the acceleration, of such an engine or vehicle/<br>
In accordance with -the present invention there is provided the use of a Fischer-Tropsch derived fuel in a fuel composition, for the purpose of improving the responsiveness of-a compression ignition engine and/or a vehicle powered by such an engine, into which engine the fuel composition is introduced.<br>
In this specification, ""improving the responsiveness" means as compared to the responsiveness of an engine and/or a vehicle wherein the fuel composition used contains no Fischer-Tropsch derived fuel.<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is also provided the use of a Fischer-Tropsch derived fuel, or of a fuel composition containing a Fischer-Tropsch derived fuel, to improve the responsiveness of a compression ignition engine and/of a vehicle powered by such an engine, into which engine said fuel or fuel composition is introduced.<br><br>
In said uses according to the present invention, said compression ignition engine is preferably a turbocharged direct injection diesel engine.<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is still further provided a method of improving the responsiveness of a compression ignition engine and/or a vehicle powered by such an engine by replacing in said engine a fuel composition which contains no Fischer-Tropsch derived fuel by a Fischer-Tropsch derived fuel or a fuel composition which contains a Fischer-Tropsch derived fuel.<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is yet further provided a method of operating a compression ignition engine and/or a vehicle which is powered by such an engine, which method involves introducing into a combustion chamber of the engine a Fischer-Tropsch derived fuel or a fuel composition containing a Fischer-Tropsch derived fuel, for the purpose of improving the responsiveness of said engine and/or said vehicle.<br>
In said methods according to the present invention, said compression ignition engine is preferably a turbocharged direct injection diesel engine.<br>
The Fischer-Tropsch derived fuel should be suitable for use as a diesel fuel.  Its components (or the majority, for instance S5%w/w or greater, thereof) should therefore have boiling points within the typical diesel fuel ("gas oil") range, i.e. from 150 to 400°C or from 150 to 370°C. It will suitably have a 90%v/v distillation temperature (T90) of from 300 to 370°C.<br>
By "Fischer-Tropsch derived"' is meant that the fuel is, or derives from, a synthesis product of a<br><br>
Fischer-Tropsch condensation process. The Fischer-Tropsch reaction converts carbon monoxide and hydrogen into longer chain,   usually paraffinic, hydrocarbons:<br>
n(CO + 2H2) = (-CH2-)n + nH20 + heat,<br>
in the presence of an appropriate catalyst and typically at. elevated temperatures (e.g. 125 to 300*C, preferably 17 5 to 250°C) and/or pressures (e.g. 500 tc 10000 kPa, preferably 1200 to 5000 kPa).  Hydrogen:carbon monoxide ratios other than 2:1 may be employed if desired.<br>
The carbon monoxide and hydrogen may themselves be derived from organic or inorganic, natural or synthetic sources, typically either from natural gas or from organically derived methane.<br>
A  gas oil product may be obtained directly from this reaction, or indirectly for instance by fractionation of a Fischer-Tropsch synthesis product or from a hydrotreated Fischer-Tropsch synthesis product.  Hydrotreatment can involve hydrocracking to adjust the boiling range (see, e.g. GB-B-2077289 and EP-A-0147873) and/or hydroisomerisation which can improve cold flow properties by increasing the proportion of branched paraffins. EP-A-0583836 describes a two-step hydrotreatment process in which a Fischer-Tropsch synthesis product is firstly subjected to hydroconversion under conditions such that it undergoes substantially no isomerisation or hydrocracking (this hydrogenates the olefinic and oxygen-containing components), and then at least part of the resultant product is hydroconverted under conditions such that hydrocracking and isomerisation occur to yield a substantially paraffinic hydrocarbon fuel.  The desired gas<br><br>
oil fraction(s) may subsequently be isolated for instance by distillation.<br>
Other post-synthesis treatments, such as polymerisation, alkylation, distillation, cracking-decarboxylation, isomerisation and hydroreforming, may be employed to modify the properties of Fischer-Tropsch condensation products, as described for example in US-A-4125566 and US-A-4478955.<br>
Typical catalysts for the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis of<br>
paraffinic hydrocarbons comprise, as the catalytically<br>
active component, a metal from Group VIII of the periodic<br>
table, in particular ruthenium, Iron, cobalt or nickel.<br>
Suitable such catalysts are described for example in<br>
EP-A-0583836 (pages 3 and 4).	-       ■<br>
..An example of a Fischer-Tropsch based process is the SMDS (Shell Middle Distillate Synthesis) described in "The Shell Middle Distillate Synthesis Process", van der Burgt et al (paper delivered at the 5th Synfuels Worldwide Symposium, Washington DC, November 1985; see also the November 1989 publication of the same title from Shell International Petroleum Company Ltd., London, UK).  This<br>
process (also sometimes referred to as the Shell™ "Gas-to-Liquids" or "GTL" technology) produces middle distillate range products by conversion of a natural gas (primarily methane) derived synthesis gas into a heavy long-chain hydrocarbon (paraffin) wax which can then be hydroconverted and fractionated to produce liquid transport fuels such as the gas oils useable in diesel fuel compositions.  A version of the SMDS process, utilising a fixed-bed reactor for the catalytic conversion step, is currently in use in<br><br>
Bintulu, Malaysia and its products have been blended with petroleum derived gas oils in commercially available automotive fuels.<br>
" Gas oils prepared by  the SyADS  process are commercially available frcm the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Companies. Further examples of Fischer-Trcpsch derived gas oils are described in EP-A-05B3836, EF-A-1101913, WO-A-97/147 65, WO-A-97/14769, WC-A-00/20534, ;CQ-A-00/20535, WO-A-00/11116, WO-A-00/11117, WO-A-01/33405, vCO-A-01/83641, WO-A-01/83647, WO-A-01/B364B and US-A-62Q442c.<br>
Suitably, in accordance with the present invention, the Fi3cher-Tropsch derived gas   oil will consist of at least 70%w/w, preferably at least 80%w/w, more preferably at least 90%w/w, most preferably at least 95%w/w, of paraffinic components, preferably iso- and linear paraffins.  The weight ratio cf iso-paraffins to normal paraffins will suitably be greater than 0.3 and -may be up to 12; suitably it is from 2 to 6,  The actual value for this ratio will be determined, in part,, by the hydroconversion process used tc prepare the gas oil from the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis product'.  Seme cyclic paraffins may also be present.<br>
By virtue of the Fischer-Tropsch process, a Fischer-Tropsch derived gas oil has essentially nor   or undetectable levels of, sulphur and nitrogen.  Compounds containing these heteroatcns rend tc act as poisons for Fischer-Tropsch catalysts and are therefore removed from the synthesis gas feed.  Further, the process as usually operated produces no or virtually no  aromatic components. The aromatics content of a Fischer-Tropsch gas oil, as.<br><br>
determined by ASTM D462.9, will typically be below l%w/w, preferably below 0.5%w/w and more preferably.below 0.1%w/w.<br>
The Fischer-Tropsch derived gas oil used in the present invention will typically have a density from 0.76<br>
to 0.79 g/cm3 at 15*C; a cetane number (ASTM D613) greater than 70, suitably from 74 to 85; a kinematic viscosity from 2.0 to 4.5, preferably from 2.5 to 4.0, more preferably<br>
from 2.9 to 3.7, mm-/s at 40 *C; and a sulphur content of 5 ppmw (parts per million by weight) or less, preferably of 2 ppmw or less.<br>
Preferably it is a product prepared by a Fischer-Tropsch methane condensation reaction using a hydrogen/carbon monoxide ratio of less than 2.5, preferably less than 1.75, more preferably from 0.4 to 1.5, and ideally using a cobalt containing catalyst.  Suitably it will have been obtained from a hydrocracked Fischer-Tropsch synthesis product (for instance as described in GB-B-2077289 and/or EP-A-0147873), or more preferably a product from a two-stage hydroconversion process such as that described in EP-A-0583836 (see above).  In the latter case, preferred features of the hydroconversion process may be as disclosed at pages 4 to 6, and in the examples, of EP-A-0583836.<br>
The present invention is"particularly applicable where the fuel composition is used or intended to be used in a direct injection diesel engine, for example of the rotary pump, in-line pump, unit pump, electronic unit injector or common rail type, or in an indirect injection diesel engine.  It may be of particular value for rotary pump engines, and in other diesel engines which rely on<br><br>
mechanical actuation of the fuel injectors and/or a low-pressure pilot injection system.  The fuel composition maybe suitable for use in heavy and/or light duty diesel engines.<br>
The amount of Fischer-Tropach- derived gas oil used may be from 0.5 to 10G%v/v of the overall diesel fuel composition, preferably from' 0.5 to 75%v/v.  It is particularly preferred for -the composition to contain 1 to 50%v/vr and particularly 1 to 25%v/v, of the Fischer-Tropsch derived gas oil.  The balance of the fuel composition is made up of one or more other fuels.<br>
The SMDS reaction products suitably have bciling points within the typical diesel fuel range (between 150<br>
and 37 0°C), a density of between 0.7S and 0.79 g/cm3 at 15°Cr a cetane number greater than 72.7 (typically between 75 and 82) r   a sulphur content of les3 than 5 ?pmwr a<br>
viscosity between 2.9 and 3,7 rnm2/s\at 40°C and an aromatics content of no greater than l%w/w.<br>
The fuel composition of the present invention may, if required, contain one of more additives as described below.<br>
Detergent-containing die3el fuel additives ar£ known and commercially available, for instance from Infineum (e.g. F7661 and F7685) and Octal (e.g. DMA 4130D).  Such additives may be added to diesel fuels at relatively low levels (their '"standard" treat rate3 providing typically le3s than 100 ppmw active matter detergent in the overall additivatad fuel composition) intended merely to reduce or slow the build up of engine deposits.<br>
Examples of detergents suitable for use in fuel additives for the present purpose include polyolefin<br><br>
substituted succinimides or succinamides" of poly amines, for instance polyiscbutylene succinimides or polyisobutylens amine succinamides, aliphatic amines, Mannich bases or amines and polyclefin (e.g. polyiscbutylene) maleic anhydrides.  Succinimide dispsrsant additives are described for example in G5-A-960493, E?-ft-0147240, EP-A-0452253, EP-A-0613933, SP-A-0557516 and WO-A-98/42808-  Particularly preferred are pclyolefin substituted succinimides such as polyisobutylene succinimides .<br>
The additive may contain other components in addition to the detergent.  Examples are lubricity enhancers; dehazersr e.g. alkoxylated phenol formaldehyde polymers such as those commercially available as NALCO™ EC5462A (formerly7D07) (ex Nalco) and TOLAD^ 2683 (ex Petrolite); anti-foaming agents .(e.g. the polyethar-modified polyailoxanes commercially available as TEGOFREN™ 5S51 and Q 25907 (ex Dow Corning] r   SAG'*  TP-325 ..(ex OSi) and RHODORSIL™ (ex Rhone Poulenc)); ignition improvers (cetane improvers) (e.g. 2-ethylhexyi nitrate (EFJN) / cyciohexyl nitrate, di-tert-butyl peroxide and those disclosed in US-A-4208190 at column 2, line 27 to column 3, line 21); anti-rust agents (e.g. that sold commercially by Rhein Cheruie, Mannheim, Germany as nRC 4801", a propane-1,2-diol serai-ester of tetrapropenyl succinic acid, or polyhydric alcohol eaters of a succinic acid derivative,, the succinic acid derivative having on at least one of its alpha-carbon atoms an unsubstituted or substituted aliphatic hydrocarbon group containing from 20 to 500 carbon atoms, e.g. the pentaerythritol diestsr of pciyisobutylene-substituted succinic acid); corrosion inhibitors; reodorants; anti-wear<br><br>
additives; anti-oxidants (e.g. phenolics such as 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol, or phenylenediamines such as N,N'-di-sec-butyl-p-phenylenediamine); and metal deactivators.<br>
It is particularly preferred that the additive include a lubricity enhancer, especially when the fuel composition has a low (e.g. 500 ppmw or less) sulphur content.  In the additivated fuel composition, the lubricity enhancer is conveniently present at a concentration between 50 and 1000 ppmw, preferably between 100 and 1000 ppmw.  Suitable commercially available lubricity enhancers include EC 83 2 and PARADYNE™ 655 (ex Infineum), HITEC™ E580 (ex.Ethyl Corporation), VEKTRON™ 6010 (ex Infineum) and amide-based additives such as those available from the Lubrizol Chemical Company, for instance LZ 539 C.  Other lubricity enhancers are described in the patent literature, in particular in connection with their use in low sulphur consent diesel fuels, for example in:<br>
-	the paper by Danping Wei and H.A. Spikes, "The Lubricity of Diesel  Fuels", Wear, III  (1986) 217-235;<br>
-	WO-A-95/33805 - cold flow improvers to enhance lubricity of low sulphur fuels;<br>
-	WO-A-94/17160 - certain esters of a carboxyiic acid and an alcohol wherein the acid has from 2 to 50 carbon atoms and the alcohol has 1 or more carbon atoms, particularly glycerol monooleate and di-isodecyl adipate, as fuel additives for wear reduction in a diesel engine injection system;<br>
-	US-A-5484462 - mentions dimerised linoleic acid as a commercially available lubricity agent for low sulphur<br><br>
diesel fuel (column 1, line 38), and itself provides aminoalkylmorpholines as fuel lubricity improvers;<br>
-	US-A-5490864 - certain dithiophosphoric diester-dialcohols as anti-wear lubricity additives for low sulphur diesel fuels; and<br>
-	WO-A-98/01516 - certain alkyl aromatic compounds having at least one carboxyl group attached to their aromatic nuclei, to confer anti-wear lubricity effects particularly in low sulphur diesel fuels.<br>
It is also preferred that the additive contain an anti-foaming agent, more preferably in combination with an anti-rust agent and/or"a corrosion inhibitor and/or a lubricity additive.<br>
Unless otherwise stated, the (active -matter) concentration of each such additional component in the additivated fuel composition is preferably up to 10000 ppmw, more preferably in the range from 5 to 1000 ppmw, advantageously from 75 to 300 ppmw, such as from 95 to 150 ppmw.<br>
The (active matter) concentration of any dehazer in the fuel composition will preferably be in the range from 1 to 20 ppmw, more preferably from 1 to 15 ppmw, still more preferably from 1 to 10 ppmw, advantageously from 1 to 5 ppmw.  The (active matter) concentration of any ignition improver present will preferably be 600 ppmw or less, more preferably 500 ppmw or less, conveniently from 300 to 500 ppmw.<br>
The additive will typically contain the detergent, ootionally together with other components as described above, and a diesel fuel-compatible diluent, which may be a<br><br>
carrier oil (e.g. a mineral oil), a polyether, which may be capped or uncapped, a ncn-polar solvent such as toluene, xylene, white spirits and those soli by member companies of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group under zhe trade mark "SKELLSOL", and/or a polar solvent such as an ester and, in particular, an alcohol, e.g. hexan:!, 2-ethylhexanol, decanol, isotridecanol and alcohol mixtures such as those sold by member companies of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group under the trade mark "LINEVOL", especially LINEVOL™ 79 alcohol which is a mixture of C7-9 primary alcohols, or the<br>
C]_2-i4 alcohol mixture commercially available from Sidobre<br>
Sinnova, France under the trade mark "SIPCL".<br>
The additive may be suitable for use in heavy and/or light duty diesel engines.<br>
The Fischer-Tropsch fuel may be used in combination with any other fuel suitable for use in a diesel engine, such as a conventional base fuel.  Vegetable oils may also be used in mixture with the Fischer-Tropsch derived fuel, either per se  or in blends with czher  hydrocarbon fuels.<br>
Such a conventional base fuel may zypically comprise liquid hydrocarbon middle distillate fuel oii(s), for instance petroleum derived gas oils.  Such fuels will typically have boiling points with the usual diesel range of 150 to 400°C, depending on grade and use.  It will<br>
typically have a density from 0.75 to 0.9 g/cm3, preferably<br>
from 0.8 to 0.86 g/cm3, at 15°C (e.g. ASTX D4502 or IP 365) and a cetane number (ASTM D613) cf from 35 to 8C, more preferably from 40 to 75.  It will typically have an initial boiling point in the range 150 to" 2~30°C and a final boiling point in the range 290 tc 400CC.  Its kinematic<br><br>
viscosity at 40°C (ADTM D445) might suitably be from 1.5 to 4.5 mm^/s.<br>
The fuel may itself be additivated (additive-containing) or unadditivated (additive-free).  If additivated, e.g. at the refinery, it will contain minor amounts of one or more additives selected for example from anti-static agents, pipeline drag reducers, flow improvers (e.g. ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymers or acrylate/rnaieic anhydride copolymers) and wax anti-settling agents (e.g. those commercially available under the Trade Marks "PARAFLOW" (e.g. PARAFLOW™ 450, ex Infineum), "OCTEL" (e.g. OCTEL™ W 5000, ex Octel) and "DODIFLOW" (e.g. DODIFLOW1" v 3958, ex Hoechst) .<br>
Examples<br>
*-<br>
The present invention will now be described by way of example, by reference to the accompanying drawing, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows acceleration times when using conventional diesel fuels Fl and F2 and Fischer-Tropsch blends Bl, B2, and B3, as described in Example 1 below. Example 1<br>
This example illustrates the effects on the responsiveness of a first engine using Fischer-Tropsch derived diesel fuel. Test fuels<br>
The fuels used in the tests were petroleum derived diesel fuels Fl and F2, and blends containing varying proportions of petroleum derived diesel fuel Fl and a Fischer-Tropsch (SMDS) derived diesel fuel F3.  The properties of fuels Fl, F2 and F3 are shown in Table 1:<br><br><br>
Fuel F3 had been obtained frora a Fischer-Tropsch (5MDS) synthesis product via 5. two-stage hydrcconversion process analogous to that described in EP-A-G583836. Test Engine<br>
The engine used in the zests described below was a turbocharged Audi 2.5L direct injection diesel engine. However, it is emphasised that any suitable engine could be used to demonstrate the advantages of the present invention.<br><br>
The test engine had the specification set out in Tabie 2:<br><br>
Its fuel injection equipment (Bosch™) had the following specification:<br>
Nozzle and injector assembly: Bosch 0 432 193 786 Nozzle opening pressure:      190 to 200 bar (19 to 20<br>
MPa), single stage<br>
Injection pump:	Bosch VEL 400 Part No.<br>
0 460 415 998<br>
No modifications of the fuel injection system were made on installation on to a bench stand.  The fuel injection system is essentially identical to that on the road vehicle. Test blends<br>
In the following tesrs, blends Bl, B2 and B3 containing respectively 15%v/v, 30%v/v and 50%v/v of<br><br>
Fischar-Tropsch derived (SMDS) dieSel fuel F3 in admixture ■ with fuel F2, wsrs compared with fuels Fl and F2.<br>
Details of blends 51, 22 and B3 are shown in Table 3:<br>
r<br><br>
Blends Bl, B2 and B3 were prepared in 200L drums by splash blending, i.e. the component in the smaller quantity is introduced fir3t and this is then topped up with the component in the larger quantity to ensure good mixing. Test procedure<br>
. The engine referred to above was used in a bench<br>
engine format.<br>
Responsiveness relates to the response of an engine to changes in throttle position (i.e. drive demand) and the use of a bench engine brings the throttle under direct computer control.  The responsiveness of a compression ignition engine may. be established by measuring acceleration times -<br><br>
On the test bench, the coolant, oil and inter-cooler temperatures were held constant so that all tests would be conducted under identical conditions.  The engine was fully warmed up before measurements began.<br>
Data were recorded from the test bench at 32Hz in order to capture the details of the transient response of the engine.  Data from the in-cylinder pressure sensor (i.e transducer) were captured on a cycle-by-cycle basis for all transient tests.  For the steady-stiate tests, 5 0 engine cycles were recorded and averaged to give a picture of the pressure, needle lift and calculated heat release during the combustion process." Ignition delay was calculated as the crank angle between the start of injection and the point at which the heat release passes from negative (i.e. fuel evaporation) to positive (i.e. combustion starting). Measurement of acceleration<br>
Speed calculations were made using a 60-tooth wheel and a magnetic speed pick-up.  A computer converted a frequency signal generated by this equipment to rev/min.<br>
A signal from the in-cylinder pressure transducer was measured with HSDA (High Speed Data Acquisition Apparatus) to calculate IMEP.<br>
The responsiveness of the engine to the different fuels/fuel blends was tested in full throttle accelerations.  The engine load was held close to 95% of maximum to extend the duration of the acceleration, as this exaggerated the effect of small differences.<br>
40 full throttle accelerations were conducted on each fuel/fuel blend, divided into two sets of 20 so that the engine temperature did not rise excessively between each<br><br>
set.  The engine was stabilised at 1350 rev/min before the throttle was snapped open.  The tiir.e elapsed from the time the throttle was pressed to the tine that the engine passed through six speed "gates" (i.e. 1500, 1700, 2000, 2500, 3000 and 3800 rev/min) was averaged for each set of 20 accelerations and the results are shown in Table 4 and Figure 1.<br><br><br>
It can be seen from Figure 1 that, as expected, the low density diesel fuel F2 produces a lower acceleration than rhe high density diesel fuel Fl.  This is consistent with the well-known dependence of maximum torque and power on fuel density in volumetrically fuelled angines.<br>
Surprisingly, however, when using blend Bl the engine accelerated much more quickly than when using fuels Fl and F2.  It can be determined from the graph (by reference to the density) that blends of from 1 to 25%v/v Fischer-Tropsch fuel with fuel Fl would produce greater acceleration than fuel Fl.<br>
It can also be seen that the engine accelerated more quickly with blend B3 than with fuel F2, despite its low density. Example 2<br>
This example illustrates the effects on the responsiveness of a second engine using Fischer-Tropsch derived diesel fuel, and by reference to acceleration time measured with a Renault Kangoo light van in chassis dynamometer tests. Test fuels<br>
The fuels used in the tests were a petroleum derived diesel fuel F4, and a blend B4 containing 35% by volume of said diesel fuel F4 and 15% Fischer-Tropsch (SMDS) derived diesel fuel (fuel F3 of Table 1).<br>
The properties of fuel FA   and blend B4 are shown in Table 5:<br><br><br>
Test Vehicle<br>
The test vehicle had the specification set out in Table 6:<br><br>
The engine was fitted with a common rail fuel injection system. No modifications were made to the engine or fuel injection system for this "est. The test vehicle was representative of standard production vehicles. Test procedure<br>
The vehicle was installed on a chassis dynamometer, using an inertia seating equivalent to the nominal weight' of the vehicle plus driver, and r-lling resistance and wind<br><br>
resistance settings calculated from the observed "coast-down" speed of the /vehicle or. level ground.<br>
The vehicle was driven on the dynamometer until coolant and oil temperatures had stabilised.<br>
Acceleration nines were measured from 32-80 !<ra mph in gear from km and gear.></ra>
The vehicle was driven at constant speed just below the' starting speed in the chosen gear. The throttle pedal was fully depressed and the vehicle allowed to accelerate to just above the final speed in the chosen gear. Time (to the nearest 0.01 second) and speed were recorded by the chassis dynamometer data acquisition system, and the time taken to pass between the two speed "gates" was calculated.<br>
Three accelerations were measured in each gear with each fuel tested and the average acceleration time was calculated. Results<br>
The acceleration measurements are shown in Table 7, from which it can be seen that there was a consistent advantage for blend B4 compared to the base fuel F4, despite its lower density:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
