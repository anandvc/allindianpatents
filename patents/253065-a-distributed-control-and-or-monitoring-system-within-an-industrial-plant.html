				<td>The present invention relates to process control transmitters<br>
used to measure process variables in industrial processing plants. More<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to field devices with wireless<br>
transceivers powered by an external common DC bus for power supply or<br>
by an existing powercircult.<br>
In industrial settings, control systems monitor and control<br>
inventories, industrial and chemical processes, and the like. Typically,<br>
the control system perform these functions using field devices distributed<br>
at key locations in the industrial process and coupled to the control<br>
circuitry in the control room by a process control loop. The term "field<br>
device" refers to any device that performs a function in a distributed,<br>
control system, including all devices currently known in the measurement<br>
and control art.<br>
Generally, each field device includes a transducer. A<br>
transducer is understood to mean either a device that generates an<br>
output signal based on a physical input or that generates a physical<br>
output based on an input signal. Typically, a transducer transforms an<br>
input into an output having a different form. For example, a loudspeaker<br>
is a transducer that transforms electrical signals into sound energy.<br>
Types of transducers include various analytical equipment, pressure<br>
sensors, thermistors, thermocouples, strain gauges, flow transmitters,<br>
positioners, actuators, solenoids, indicator lights, and the like.<br>
Typically, each field device also includes a transmitter that<br>
boosts the transducer's signal in a standard format Such transmitters<br>
generally communicate with the control room via the process control loop.<br>
Typically, the process control loop delivers a regulated current and/or<br>
voltage for powering the field devices. Additionally, the process control<br>
loop may carry encoded signals. Traditionally, analog field devices have<br>
been connected to the control room by two-wire twisted-pair current<br>
loops, with each device connected to the control room by a single two-<br><br>
wire twisted pair loop. Typically, a voltage differential is maintained<br>
between the two wires within a range of voltages from 12-45 voJts for<br>
analog mode and 9-50 volts for digital mode. An analog field device<br>
transmits a signal to the control room by modulating the current running<br>
through the current loop to a current proportional to the sensed process<br>
variable. An analog field device that performs an action under the control<br>
of the control room is controlled by the magnitude of the current through<br>
the loop, which is modulated by the ports of the process subsystem under<br>
the control of the control room.<br>
Discrete or digital field devices respond to a binary signals<br>
and transmit binary information. Typically, discrete devices operate with<br>
a 5-30 volt signal (AC or DC), a 120 or 240 volt AC signal, delivered by<br>
the same or similar two-wire twisted pair loops. Of course, a discrete<br>
device may be designed to operate according to any electrical<br>
specification required by the control environment.<br>
Generally, in industrial plants, the individual field devices<br>
are wired to a junction box, and from there to the control room or to<br>
marshaling racks through home run cables. Since cabling distances from<br>
the field device to the junction box are relatively short, the bulk of the<br>
cabling cost is in the home run cable. HART® is a well established<br>
standard but control systems in general do not support HART® multidrop<br>
configurations; therefore, there is little savings from wiring using the<br>
HART® protocol. The few control systems supporting HART® generally<br>
have limited access to device diagnostics and do not use the digital<br>
information for control due to speed limitations.<br>
Since communications and power typically are delivered<br>
over the same wires, various properties must be taken into account in<br>
order to have a successful installation, such as proper shielding against<br>
noise, low ripple power supplies, appropriate line and power impedances,<br>
wire length and properties, impedance, terminations, and the like. Using<br>
the same pair of wires for communication and power also makes power<br>
regulation of the device more complicated. Simple low pass filters cannot<br><br>
be used to remove noise from the power signal because a "notch" at the<br>
communications frequency must be allowed to bass. Specifically, the low<br>
pass filter has a tendency to "refine" the load current, thereby reducing<br>
ripples or notches in the AC communication signal. It is important to note<br>
that the transmitters are basically shunt regulators that shunt between 4<br>
and 20 mA in analog transmitters. In order to shunt on the low end (i.e. at<br>
4 mA), the transmitter must operate at a power of less then 4 mA.<br>
With the advent of low power wireless communications,<br>
many new network topologies can be imagined. However, power<br>
constraints of wireless transmitters typically limit process control networks<br>
to the traditional wired topology. A truly wireless field device is one that<br>
contains its own source of power, such as a battery, solar power, fuel cell,<br>
an energy scavenging power source, and the like, and is not constrained<br>
by traditional wired configurations.<br>
However, such wireless transmitters suffer from the basic<br>
problem of low available power, which tends to limit the utility of such field<br>
devices. Specifically, the low available power forces the use of low data<br>
rates to help conserve energy, and/or requires frequent, periodic<br>
replacement of the power source. Transmission power also restrains the<br>
transmitting distance.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A system for supplying power to a plurality of field devices<br>
has a plant-wide or field-based power bus for delivering power to each<br>
field device. Some field devices are adapted to regulate their own power<br>
and to communicate wirelessly with a control center. Other field devices<br>
are connected to the network via a junction box, and the junction box is<br>
adapted to regulate power to a cluster of field devices. The junction box<br>
may also be adapted for shared wireless communication with the control<br>
center. Existing process control networks may be adapted for wireless<br>
communication by integrating a wireless transceiver with the control<br>
center. The process control network may be entirely wireless or may be a<br>
hybrid wired/wireless network. Each field device has a housing, a<br><br>
transducer within the housing, and an electrical terminal for delivering<br>
power to the circuit from an existing power circuit. In some embodiments,<br>
each field device contains a wireless communications board for<br>
communicating wirelessly with the control center. In an alternative<br>
embodiment, clusters of fiefd devices share a wireless communication<br>
board disposed within a junction box for communicating wirelessly with<br>
the control center. The wireless communications boards utilize standard<br>
communications protocols to facilitate communications between the field<br>
devices and the control center and between various field devices. In this<br>
manner, the system may be organized as a traditional process control<br>
network or may be organized dynamically as a self-organizing network.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention takes advantage of available wireless<br>
technologies to free the process control network from its traditional wired<br>
topologies. Wireless transceivers can be used both to adapt existing<br>
process control networks to provide wireless communications capabilities<br><br>
and to construct process control networks without costly homerun cabling -<br>
and without expensive power filters.<br>
In general, the wireless transceivers send and receive data<br>
wirelessly, thereby divorcing the signaling or communications path from<br>
the physical wiring. While conventional process control networks<br>
provided power and signaling over the same set of wires, by handling the<br>
power supply to the field devices separately from the signaling or<br>
communications path in the present invention, the field devices are no<br>
longer bound to the physical wiring of a control network. Instead, data is<br>
transmitted wirelessly. and power is supplied to the field devices from a<br>
variety of different means, allowing the field devices to be deployed<br>
dynamically and to be arranged in a variety of ways.<br>
While conventional process control networks utilized costly<br>
power filters to maintain a tightly controlled power distribution, the<br>
separation of the power supply from the communications path allows field<br>
devices to be provided with their own power supply circuitry, which can be<br>
much cheaper and less tightly controlled than conventional systems.<br>
Thus, an entire process control network can be constructed without<br>
expensive power filtering and with distributed field devices drawing power<br>
from many different sources. Such sources may include batteries,<br>
existing homerun cabling, standard plant-wide power (e.g. a wall outlet<br>
providing conventional 120 AC power, and the like), a single charged<br>
wire, solar power circuitry, and various other power sogrces. In general,<br>
since the power supply does not need to be tightly regulated and since<br>
communications Is handled wirelessly between the field devices and<br>
control systems within the control room, any type of power supply can be<br>
utilized to power the field devices. By powering the field devices from<br>
power supplies that are separate from the communications path, the<br>
process control network architecture becomes more versatile and with<br>
lower cost, allowing for network topologies that were not previously<br>
possible without significant investment in cabling and allowing for<br>
inexpensive hardware components.<br><br>
With the present invention, it is possible to integrate<br>
wireless technologies with existing process control networks. Specifically,<br>
wireless devices may be added to existing networks and existing field<br>
devices may be adapted to transmit wireless information. Additionally,<br>
existing cabling may be utilized differently to deliver power to field devices<br>
(individually and in clusters), and to allow flexibility in extending or<br>
shrinking the size of the network.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, a process control network 10 has a<br>
control system 12 and a field device 14, having a power supply 16 and a<br>
power supply circuit 18 (shown in phantom), respectively. The power<br>
supply circuit 18 is shown in phantom to indicate that the power supply<br>
circuit 18 may be internal or external to the field device 14. As shown,<br>
the field device 14 communicates with the control system 12, wirelessly,<br>
to transmit and to receive data and various signals.<br>
Generally, the control system 12 refers to one or more<br>
computer systems for exercising control and/or monitoring of an industrial<br>
process. The control system 12 may be confined within a control room,<br>
may span more than one office, or may be geographically separated and<br>
connected via a network (such as telephone networks, the Internet, or<br>
any other type of network). Additionally, the control system 12 Includes<br>
both automated and user initiated control systems.<br>
In this embodiment, the control system 12 and the field<br>
device 14 may be powered by the same circuit or by independent power<br>
supplies. However, by providing the field devices 14 with their own power<br>
supply circuit 18, expensive and tightly controlled filtering is no longer<br>
required. Nor are long wires required to power the device. Relatively -<br>
unregulated power supplies can be used to deliver power to the field<br>
devices 14, allowing field devices 14 to be powered with simple,<br>
inexpensive power supplies 16,18. With the present invention, since<br>
filtering of transmitted information not a concern with respect to the<br>
wiring, the power supplies 16,18 can use simple filtering techniques.<br><br>
It is important to note that FIG. 1 assumes that the control<br>
system 12 is equipped or configured td transmit and receive data and<br>
signals, wirelessiy. Additionally, the embodiment of FIG. 1 illustrates a<br>
field device 14 with wireless transmission and reception capabilities.<br>
FIG. 2 shows a process control system 10 having a control<br>
system 12 and a field device 14, both capable of wireless<br>
communications. As shown, the field device 14 has a power supply<br>
circuit 18, which delivers power to an actuator/transducer 20 (hereinafter<br>
referred to as "transducer 20") and to a wireless communications board<br>
22. The wireless communications board 22 refers to circuitry for<br>
transmitting and receiving information wirelessiy between the control<br>
system 12 and the field device 14. tn some instances, the wireless<br>
communications board 22 may perform other functions, such as digitizing<br>
analog information received from the transducer 20, prior to transmission<br>
of the information.<br>
The transducer 20 is understood to refer to any device that<br>
translates an input into an output having a different form from the input<br>
(e.g. a device that generates a physical output based on an electrical<br>
input signal or an electrical output based on a physical input signal).<br>
Thus, the field device 14 containing a transducer 20 can be either an<br>
input device or an output device or both. The field device 14 can contain<br>
both input and output components in communication with the<br>
communications board 22. For example, the field device 14 may contain<br>
both a sensor and indicator lights or an LCD display, for sensing<br>
information and transmitting the raw data or raw A/D count to the wireless<br>
communications board 22, and for receiving a display signal or display<br>
code from transceiver 24 of the control system 12 and displaying a value<br>
on the display.<br>
Generally, the wireless communications board 22 and the<br>
wireless transceiver 24 are each capable of two-way, wireless<br>
communications, allowing for two-way wireless communications between<br>
the control system 12 and the field devices 14. The two-way wireless<br><br>
communication may be completed using wireless networking<br>
technologies (such as IEEE 802.11b wireless access points and wireless<br>
networking devices built by Llnksys of Irvine, California), cellular or digital<br>
networking technologies (such as Mlcroburst® by Aeris Communications.<br>
Inc. of San Jose, California), ultra wide band, free space optics, Global<br>
System for Mobile Communications (GSM), Genera! Packet Radio<br>
Service (GPRS), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), spread<br>
spectrum technology, infrared communication techniques, SMS (short<br>
messaging serviceytext messaging), or any other wireless technology.<br>
More generally, the present invention can make use of any wireless<br>
protocol capable of supporting data transmissions, including<br>
transmissions over any circuit switched network or any packetized routing<br>
network.<br>
Again, the power supply circuit 18 is shown in phantom to<br>
illustrate that the power supply circuit 18 may be contained within the field<br>
device 14 or may be separate from the field device 14. The power supply<br>
16 (shown in FIG. 1) for the control system 12 may be a plant-wide power<br>
bus, a standard power circuit, or any other type of power supply. As<br>
shown, the field device 14 is powered independently from the control<br>
system 12, and wireless data transmissions between the field device 14<br>
and the control system 12 do not impact the power supply scheme.<br>
The power supply circuit 18 of the field device 14 may be a<br>
wall-plug with a transformer for stepping down and filtering power from a<br>
standard electrical socket. Alternatively, the power supply circuit 18 of<br>
the field device 14 may be a filtering circuit connected to a plant-wide<br>
power bus, or a rechargeable battery connected with a solar device, or<br>
any other power supply. In general, the power supply circuit 18 refers to<br>
any circuitry required to deliver an appropriate voltage and/or current level<br>
to a field device 14 for operation.<br>
It is important to understand that traditional process control<br>
networks employ hornerun cabling to connect a control center with<br>
distributed field devices. Typically, the hornerun cabling extends from the<br><br>
control center to a junction box, which in turn connects directly to the field<br>
devices. Communications between the field devices and the control<br>
center traverse a path from the control center, through the junction box<br>
and on to the field device, and information from the field device is<br>
transmitted over the same path in reverse.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates an embodiment of the process control<br>
system 10 according to the present invention, which Is made possible by<br>
the wireless transmission capabilities. In particular, the process control<br>
system 10 has a control system 12, which does not by itself have wireless<br>
capability. However, the control system 12 is coupled with a wireless<br>
transceiver 24. which may have its own power supply 26 (Internal or<br>
external to the wireless transceiver 24). The wireless transceiver 24<br>
adapts the control system 12 to send and receive information wirelessly.<br>
Thus, with minimal additional equipment, the control system 12 is capable<br>
of issuing and receiving signals wirelessly.<br>
The process control system 10 also has one or more<br>
junction boxes 28 connected with several field devices 30 and with a<br>
power supply 34 and/or a power supply circuit 16. In this instance, unlike<br>
field devices 14 (in FIGS. 1 and 2) which are provided with their own<br>
wireless capabilities, the field devices 30 cannot directly transmit and<br>
receive information wirelessly. However, the junction boxes 28 can be<br>
adapted to provide shared wireless transceivers, such that data can be<br>
transmitted over wires from the field device 30 to the junction box 28 and<br>
then wirelessly from the Junction box 28 to the wireless transceiver 24 and<br>
then to the control system 12.<br>
With respect to power delivery, in this embodiment, the<br>
junction boxes 28 deliver power to each field device 30. The junction box<br>
28 can be provided with an external power supply 34 and/or with a power<br>
supply circuit 16 for regulating power to the field devices 30. Additionally,<br>
the junction box 28 may draw power from a plant-wide power bus 32, or<br>
from any other power source, including an electrical outlet<br><br>
By adapting existing networks to send and receive<br>
information wirelessly, a number of advantages are obtained over<br>
traditional wired network topologies. First, additional wired field devices<br>
30 and wireless field devices 14 (Figure 2) can be added without the cost<br>
of additional homerun cabling.<br>
Additionally, "smart devices" (for example, field devices 14<br>
or 30 capable of transmitting diagnostic information, device failure<br>
information, and the like, to the control system 12) can be added to the<br>
process control network 10, without requiring changes to the control<br>
system 12. In particular, while it is possible to add smart devices to a<br>
traditional process control network, a traditional control system may not<br>
pay attention or be capable of making use of the transmitted diagnostic<br>
information. The adaptation of the control system 12 to send and receive<br>
wireless information via the wireless transceiver 24 ensures that the<br>
diagnostic information reaches the control system 12 without being<br>
filtered out. Additionally, if the control system 12 cannot make use of the<br>
information transmitted by the smart device, the data need not be lost as<br>
it can be received at the wireless transceiver 24 and then<br>
programmatically diverted to a computer within the control room that can<br>
make use of the diagnostic information. In this way, a control system can<br>
be adapted to become a control and monitoring system, with minimal<br>
investment In equipment and software.<br>
Finally, since Information is transmitted wirelessly between<br>
the field devices 30 and the control system 12 via the wireless transceiver<br>
24, the requirements for power regulation are minimized, allowing for<br>
cheaper power supplies. As previously discussed, conventional process<br>
control networks required tight control over the power supply because the<br>
same cable often carried both the power and the signals. Since<br>
communications and power are run across the same wire, the power<br>
regulation at the device is complicated, and therefore expensive.<br>
Typically, special power conditioners and/or terminators had to be<br>
installed to allow such signaling. Moreover, the cabling was expensive<br><br>
because it had to be shielded cabling, because it had to be balanced with<br>
a selected impedance, and so on. Simple low-pass filters cannot be used<br>
because a "notch" at the communications frequency must be allowed to<br>
pass. Additionally, conventional field devices do not include power<br>
regulation circuitry or signal filtering circuitry that is sophisticated enough<br>
to handle signal transmissions over a wire carrying an unregulated<br>
voltage.<br>
With the present invention, the plant-wide power bus 32 can<br>
be a loosely regulated power line, without concern for the field devices<br>
30, because the localized power supplies 34 or power circuits 16 can<br>
perform the necessary filtering. Thus, the plant-wide power bus 32 can<br>
be a single wire bearing a voltage potential. For example, the plant-wide<br>
power bus 32 can deliver a twenty-four or forty-eight volt alternating<br>
current (AC) or direct current (DC).<br>
Alternatively, the various devices can be powered from<br>
existing power circuity in the walls through standard electrical outlets,<br>
which may be a 120 or 240 V AC circuit, such as the circuits that provide<br>
power to plugs and switches within offices. In industrial settings, such<br>
power circuits may be 480 V, and in countries outside of America, other<br>
voltage amplitudes may be employed.<br>
As previously discussed, it Is also possible to power field<br>
devices 30,14 from batteries or solar power, depending on the specific<br>
signaling requirements. For example, it may be inefficient to use batteries<br>
in an environment where the device 30,14 must signal frequently,<br>
because the batteries would wear out quickly, requiring frequent<br>
replacement However, if the batteries are rechargeable and are used in<br>
an environment where they can recharge themselves (via solar panels) or<br>
where they are infrequently used, then such power sources can also be<br>
utilized.<br>
In essence, the junction box 28 allows for clusters of<br>
wireless field devices 14 or wired field device 30 to be added to a process<br>
control network 10 without the need for additional homerun cabling. Such<br><br>
clusters of field devices can be powered by a simple local power grid or<br>
via individual power sources. Since plants typically have AC power run<br>
throughout the facilities, similar to a house, a cheap power supply could<br>
be used to provide the DC power to a cluster of transmitters simply by<br>
tapping into the existing AC power and stepping down the voltage.<br>
FIG. 4 Illustrates an alternative embodiment of the present<br>
invention wherein the field device 30 Is provided with its own power<br>
supply 18. In this embodiment, the junction box 28 and the control<br>
system 12 are both powered from the plant-wide power bus 32. The<br>
control system 12 fs adapted for wireless transmissions via a wireless<br>
transceiver 24. Additionally, the junction box 28 is provided with a shared<br>
wireless transceiver 36 (shown in phantom) to adapt the duster of wired<br>
field devices 30 for wireless transmissions.<br>
!n this way, the individual power supplies and wiring for the<br>
junction box 28 (not shown) and the power supplies 18 for the field<br>
devices 30 can be made very cheaply, to provide the appropriate level of<br>
power to each of the various components without concern for signal<br>
filtering. Once again, since wireless transmissions are used to<br>
communicate between the field devices 30 and the control system 12, the<br>
power supply means can be essentially "ad hoc", meaning as needed to<br>
fit the particular circumstance and without consideration of wider<br>
application<br>
Thus, by divorcing power delivery from signaling, field<br>
devices 30,14 can be inserted into an existing network by tapping into an<br>
existing power circuit, such as a standard AC power circuit (e.g. via a wall<br>
outlet). The power supply 18 may be simply a standard plug with a<br>
transformer. Alternatively, the power supply 18 may be a rechargeable<br>
battery connected with a solar panel or other environmentally sustainable<br>
power source. In another embodiment, the power supply 18 may be a<br>
rechargeable battery connected to a standard wail socket or an<br>
uninterruptable power supply (UPS), similar to (but smaller than) such<br>
devices designed for power failover in networks and the like.<br><br>
More importantly, since the voltage supply does not need to<br>
be as tightly regulated, simple low-pass or other types of filters can be<br>
used to provide power regulation at the field devices 18 or in the junction<br>
box 28. In this way, the overall cost of installation and expansion of a<br>
process control network 10 is reduced, in part, because additional field<br>
devices 14,30 and junction boxes 28 can be added to the network 10<br>
without expensive homerun cabling 14.<br>
In general, by divorcing the signaling path from the power<br>
supply and by providing a variety of means for delivering power to the<br>
field devices 14 and 30, the process control network 10 can be configured<br>
in multiple ways, using network topologies and configurations that might<br>
not otherwise be feasible. Specifically, additional field devices 14 and 30<br>
(together with shared wireless transceivers 36 as needed) can be added<br>
to the process control network 10 as needed, and without concern for the<br>
geographic proximity of the individual wireless field devices 14 or of the<br>
adapted field devices 30 to the existing network wiring. Using standard<br>
and inexpensive power supplies coupled with existing power circuitry,<br>
field devices 30 (with a shared wireless transceiver 36) and field devices<br>
14 (with built-in wireless communications boards 22) can communicate<br>
wirelessly with the control system 12, regardless of their physical location<br>
relative to the control system 12.<br>
The present invention introduces several advantages over<br>
traditional control networks. First, by divorcing the power supply and ths<br>
signaling path, the present Invention allows for inexpensive expansion of<br>
existing networks because once the control system 12 is adapted for<br>
wireless transmissions, new field devices 14 can be added as needed<br>
without requiring additional wiring. Additionally, by relying on existing<br>
power networks to power individual field devices 14 or groups of field<br>
devices 14 or 30, the number of field devices 14,30 In the network is not<br>
limited by cabling, allowing for easy expansion of existing networks 10.<br>
Furthermore, since the field devices 14,30 no longer derive their power<br>
and signals from the same path, communication may be dramatically<br><br>
and/or dynamically altered. Specifically, in certain circumstances, it may<br>
be desirable for the field devices 14,30 or rather their communications<br>
with the control system 12 to be self-organizing.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates a hybrid network containing a self-<br>
organizing wireless communication component and the wireless ,<br>
communication discussed with respect to FIGS. 1-4. As shown, the<br>
control system 12 is adapted to transmit and receive information<br>
wirelessly via a wireless transceiver 24. The control system 12 is<br>
powered by a plant-wide power bus 32, which may be a single voltage<br>
carrying wire, an existing power circuit, or any other power delivery<br>
mechanism. Depending on what type of power delivery mechanism the<br>
plant-wide power bus 32 is. the control system 12 and the Junction box 28<br>
may be provided as required with power filtering circuitry (not shown).<br>
As shown, a junction box 28 is adapted to provide wireless<br>
communications between wired field devices 30 and the control system<br>
12 via a shared wireless transceiver 36. The junction box 28 draws<br>
power from the same plant-wide power bus 32 as the control system 12.<br>
Finally, in this embodiment, a self-organizing portion of the<br>
control network 10 includes a junction box 38 provided with a wireless<br>
transceiver 40A and a wireless transceiver 40B. The junction box 38 is<br>
powered with Its own power supply 26. Two field devices 14 in<br>
communication with each other and with the wireless transceiver 40B of<br>
the junction box 38 are shown. Each field device 14 is provided with its<br>
own power supply 18.<br>
In this embodiment, the field devices 14 include a wireless<br>
transceiver and a transducer/actuator (not shown). The wireless<br>
transceiver of the field devices 14 (in this instance) may be short range or<br>
802.11 (b) type communications (or any other type of wireless<br>
communications). The field devices 14 can relay messages from another<br>
field device 14 or communicate directly with the junction box 38 and its<br>
wireless transceiver 40B. The junction box 38 relays information between<br>
the control center 12 and the field devices 14. Specifically, information<br><br>
sent by the field devices 14 is received by the wireless transceiver 40B,<br>
which passes the information to wireless transceiver 40A for transmission<br>
to the control center 12 via wireless transceiver 24. Signals sent from the<br>
control center 12 follow the same path in reverse. If, for some reason, a<br>
field device 14 is unable to transmit directly to the Junction box 38, the<br>
field device 14 can simply find a different path, by transmitting the data to<br>
the junction box 38 via another field device 14.<br>
As shown, the type of signal between the field devices 14<br>
and the junction box 38 are different than those between the junction box<br>
38 and the control system 12, indicating a different type of transceiver<br>
card. However, the entire control network 10 can be implemented as a<br>
self organizing network, such that data could travel back and forth across<br>
the network by wirelessly relaying the information. Essentially, the field<br>
devices 14 can be implemented to form a loose-knit, variable, process<br>
control network 10, which can adapt to transmit and receive information<br>
between field devices 14 and the control system 12 via any available data<br>
path. This type of network may utilize 802.11(b)-type, short-range<br>
wireless communications, infrared, or any type of wireless<br>
communications.<br>
With a self-organizing process control network 10, newly<br>
added field devices 14 simply see the wireless signal and begin<br>
communicating. If, for some reason, a field device 26 goes off-line,<br>
transmissions can be instantly adapted over a different signal path via the<br>
self-organizing network. As shown, the signals may take different paths<br>
as needed. Moreover, new communication paths may be made or<br>
broken as needed to facilitate communications between the control<br>
system 12 and the individual field devices 14.<br>
The advantages of the self-organizing network architecture<br>
are numerous, though one foreseeable downside is the fact that a<br>
significant portion of a plant may need to be "set up" for this architecture<br>
to work. As wireless connectivity becomes cheaper and easier to use,<br>
existing systems can be adapted easily and cost effectively. Also, if the<br><br>
communication protocol that is selected is a standard communications<br>
protocol (such as IEEE 802.15.4 and the like), connection to the host is<br>
made very simple. The cost advantages of this architecture are so large<br>
and the prices of wireless components are so cheap that the adaptation<br>
of a traditional host system can be very low cost.<br>
An additional advantage of this system 10 is that current<br>
power supplies used to power wireless sensors or field devices 14 would<br>
be eliminated, thereby reducing environmental implications of spent<br>
power sources such as batteries- By powering the field devices 14 from<br>
an existing power circuit, no new infrastructure wiring is required and no<br>
new power source waste is generated. Moreover, cost savings in wiring<br>
alone can be significant, particularly in large plants or in control processes<br>
where the process changes dramatically.<br>
FIG. 6 shows a process control network 10 with a control<br>
system 12 adapted for wireless communications via a wireless<br>
transceiver 24. A junction box 28 is provided with a shared wireless<br>
transceiver 36 for field devices 30. Both the control system 12 and the<br>
junction box 28A are powered from the same plant-wide power bus 32. A<br>
second junction box 28B is provided with a separate power supply 26 and<br>
a power supply circuit 42, for delivering power from the power supply 26<br>
to the wireless field devices 14. As shown, the field devices 14 are<br>
individually grounded (ground 46), allowing the power to be delivered via<br>
a single wire 44 to ons or more field devices 14.<br>
As previously discussed, by divorcing the communication<br>
path from the power supply, the process control network 10 need no<br>
longer be defined by the wiring (or by the homerun cabling). By utilizing<br>
wireless communications, existing process control networks can be<br>
adapted and new process control and monitoring networks can be<br>
constructed, changed, and extended as needed and without expensive<br>
rewiring. In particular, wireless field devices 14 can be plugged in and<br>
added to an existing network on the fly, wired devices 30 can be adapted<br>
to provide wireless communications via a shared wireless transceiver 36,<br><br>
smart devices can be inserted, and each can be powered according io<br>
available power circuits. If a wall socket is nearby, the device can be<br>
plugged into the wall socket. Alternatively, a single voltage carrying wire<br>
(as opposed to more expensive homerun cabling) can be run throughout<br>
the facility, and power filtering can then be performed at the individual<br>
field devices 14, 30 or at the junction box in order to deliver the necessary<br>
power.<br>
Although the present invention has been described with<br>
reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will<br>
recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing<br>
from the spirit and scope of the invention. <br><br>
