				<td>PATENT APPLICATION<br>
A Process for Processing a Raw Clay<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for the precipitation of a<br>
precipitate from an acid suspension containing at least one<br>
solid, an adsorbent obtainable by this process, and the use of<br>
this adsorbent, in particular as bleaching earth or as degumming<br>
aid.<br>
Vegetable and animal oils and fats, as a rule, cannot be used<br>
immediately after they have been obtained because they still<br>
contain concomitant substances which adversely affect the taste,<br>
the smell, the appearance or the storage stability. Therefore,<br>
in particular with vegetable oils, these undesirable concomitant<br>
substances are removed in a multi-stage raffination process.<br>
This raffination process consists of a combination of physical<br>
treatment.s, e.g. filtration, drying or steam destillation, with<br><br>
chemical treatment methods, e.g. treatment with acids or bases<br>
and/or treatment with adsorbents and catalysts. Important steps<br>
of this raffination process are the so-called "degumming" and<br>
the so-called "bleaching".<br>
In the degumming process, water-soluble concomitant substances<br>
of the oil, e.g. phospholipids, are removed. For this purpose,<br>
the raw oil is mixed with water and optionally with a mild acid,<br>
e.g. citric acid or phosphoric acid, and, after a certain inter-<br>
action time, the agueous phase is separated from the oil. For<br>
the degumming silica gels having a high water content are also<br>
used which, in particular, can effect an improved phospholipid<br>
reduction in the oil. Generally, highly active bleaching earths<br>
may not be used as degumming agents because their adsorption<br>
power is insufficient under the conditions of the degumming<br>
process.<br>
After degumming, the heated oil is mixed with bleaching earths<br>
for discoloration and for the adsorption of undesirable concomi-<br>
tant substances. Bleaching earths are mostly alumosilicates<br>
which are produced by thermal activation or by activation with<br>
acids from naturally occurring materials, e.g. montmorillonite<br>
or attapulgite. Fully-synthetic materials on the basis of alu-<br>
mosilicates are also known. The treatment with bleaching earths<br>
in many cases is a key step of the raffination, because a plu-<br>
rality of undesirable concomitant substances may be adsorptively<br>
removed or converted into tolerable substances by a catalytic<br>
reaction in a single step.<br>
For degumming or bleaching, synthetic adsorbents are used as<br>
well as adsorbents which are derived from naturally occurring<br>
minerals.<br>
Synthetic bleaching earths are generally produced by precipita-<br>
tion of water glass with acids in the presence of aluminium<br><br>
salts. In order to obtain a porous product by this process, the<br>
precipitation must be carried out under controlled conditions,<br>
mostly in diluted solutions. A gel-like product is obtained<br>
which may be washed salt-free only with great efforts and by<br>
using large amounts of water. In order to obtain a sufficient<br>
bleaching activity, it is also necessary to convert the products<br>
into active alumosilicates by spray-drying and subsequent calci-<br>
nation .<br>
The production of such synthetic bleaching earths is disclosed,<br>
for example, in EP 938 375 Al. At first, a water glass solution<br>
is acidified until the formation of a hydrogel, and the hydrogel<br>
is then mixed with a solution of divalent or polyvalent metals.<br>
The metal salts are mostly salts of iron and aluminium. After<br>
mixing, the pH is raised by the addition of alkali until a pre-<br>
cipitate is formed. The precipitate is separated from the solu-<br>
tion and washed. The washed precipitate is then dried and op-<br>
tionally calcined. Before drying, the washed precipitate may<br>
also be re-suspended and then spray-dried. The spray-dried prod-<br>
uct is calcined at about 450Â°C until a residual water content of<br>
about 0.5 to 2 weight % is obtained. Due to the complicated<br>
manufacturing process, the strongly diluted solutions and the<br>
high salt loads in the waste water and the amount of energy used<br>
for spray-drying and calcining, such synthetic bleaching earths<br>
are very expensive and have so far not been widely used.<br>
The adsorbents on the basis of silica gels used for degumming<br>
are produced by precipitation from pure water glass solutions. A<br>
precipitate is also formed which was must be washed salt-free<br>
with high effort. The silica gel obtained by the precipitation<br>
must also be converted into stable, high-surfaces and highly po-<br>
rous silicate by spray-drying and calcinations processes. The<br>
production and use of such silica gels is disclosed in the docu-<br>
ments EP 185 182, EP 234 221, EP 361 622 and EP 389 057.<br><br>
At present, bleaching earths are used for bleaching which essen-<br>
tially have been produced from montmorillonite. Montmorillonite<br>
is a layered alumosilicate which has a low porosity and surface<br>
area. In order to obtain a highly active bleaching earth, the<br>
raw clay is purified, suspended in strong inorganic acids and<br>
leached at increased temperatures. During this treatment, compo-<br>
nents are dissolved out of the mineral and large amounts of<br>
salt-containing waste water are produced which must be disposed<br>
of. Depending on the quality of the raw clay used, bleaching<br>
earths are obtained which mostly universally may be used for the<br>
upgrading of different oils, e.g. rape, linseed or sunflower oil<br>
and which achieve an at least sufficient bleaching action. In<br>
order to obtain particularly highly active systems, both the raw<br>
clay used and the activation process has to be adapted to the<br>
oil to be bleached. The waste waters obtained with the bleaching<br>
of the raw clay with acid and during the washing of the leached<br>
raw clay may be used, for example, as precipitation aids, due to<br>
their contents of aluminium ions. However, the content of the<br>
aluminium ions in the wash solutions decreasing rapidly during<br>
washing so that these washing waste waters can no longer be<br>
processed to commercial products and must therefore be disposed<br>
of. To this end, the aluminium and iron ions contained in the<br>
washing solution are precipitated by means of lime milk. The<br>
remaining water-soluble salts must then be disposed of according<br>
to the applicable legal requirements.<br>
In order to solve the problem of the waste water disposal, acti-<br>
vation processes have been developed in which no waste waters<br>
are produced. Accordingly, US 5,008,226 discloses a process in<br>
which a naturally occurring raw clay having a high content of<br>
palygorskite is activated by spraying with up to 10 weight %<br>
sulphuric acid. No washing steps are necessary at all and there-<br>
fore no acid waste waters are formed. The disadvantage of this<br>
process is that only certain raw clays may be used for this kind<br><br>
of activation, and the products obtained thereby must always be<br>
closely adapted to one application. They generally have bleach-<br>
ing activities which are too low in order to be used for the<br>
bleaching of different oils.<br>
In particular, if different oils are used in a plant, the indi-<br>
vidual charges of which are not so large that the storage of<br>
specially tuned bleaching earths is economically justified,<br>
highly active bleaching earths are used which have a substan-<br>
tially broader application spectrum. The manufacture of highly<br>
active bleaching earths by leaching with strong acids, there-<br>
fore, continues to have a high significance. Thus, the waste<br>
water problem remains relevant.<br>
For the treatment of the waste water from the bleaching earth<br>
production, the acid solutions, as described above, are mostly<br>
neutralized and the metal salt ions contained therein are pre-<br>
cipitated.<br>
DE 20 36 819 discloses a process for the preparation of silica-<br>
tic adsorption and drying agents. Homogeneous precipitation<br>
products are produced from solutions of salts with di- and/or<br>
trivalent cations with aqueous alkali metal silicate solutions.<br>
The solutions contain Fe2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Al3+ and/or Fe3+ as<br>
cations. The alkali silicate metal solution is either a sodium<br>
or potassium water glass solution which is preferably used in a<br>
0.6 to 1.4 molar concentration. The precipitation products are<br>
then essentially liberated from alkali ions by washing, and are<br>
dried at temperatures of not more than 130Â°C.<br>
According to EP 938 375, a salt-containing solution as is<br>
formed, for example, during the manufacture of bleaching earths,<br>
is reacted to form a synthetic bleaching earth product by pre-<br>
cipitation with water glass. Due to the use of water glass, the<br>
performance of the process is complicated due to the formation<br><br>
of gels, and can be handled only in diluted solutions. This<br>
process also requires spray-drying and calcination in order to<br>
obtain active bleaching earth systems.<br>
WO 95/11199 discloses the treatment of acid waste water from the<br>
production of bleaching earth by precipitation with a base and<br>
separating the solids formed thereby. As bases there are used<br>
magnesium salts, preferably magnesite. The filter cakes thus<br>
obtained are subsequently dissolved by treating with dilute sul-<br>
phuric acid, resulting in a product which may be used as a pre-<br>
cipitation aid in the waste water treatment.<br>
DE 43 06 663 discloses a process for environmentally friendly<br>
processing of acid waste water, thereby obtaining a sorbent. For<br>
that purpose an acid waste water from the bleaching earth pro-<br>
duction is reacted with an alkali metal silicate solution, the<br>
obtained precipitate is separated from the aqueous phase and<br>
optionally purified and dried. The obtained sorbent may be used<br>
for th bleaching of oils or for the removal of soaps, phosphol-<br>
ipids and heavy metals from oils, in particular edible oils.<br>
DE 21 00 627 discloses a process for compacting waste. After<br>
destruction of solid components the waste is treated with an<br>
aqueous solution of an alkali metal silicate as a binding agent.<br>
The destruction of solid matter is performed mechanically. The<br>
waste is treated with such amounts of the aqueous solution of<br>
the alkali metal silicate and a silicate hardening agent, that<br>
by reaction of both components a product is obtained that is<br>
chemically and physically inert, solid and almost insolubl in<br>
water. Before compaction the waste material may be deposited on<br>
soil in a liquid state, on which a solidification takes place<br>
after deposition.<br>
In summary, it can be stated that synthetic adsorbents, due to<br>
their complicated manufacture and the high costs associated<br><br>
therewith, can be used as degumming agents or as bleaching earth<br>
on a large technical scale only in selected cases. In spite of<br>
the large amounts of waste water produced during the prepara-<br>
tion, the bleaching earths which are preferably used are on the<br>
basis of montmorillonitic minerals. Processes for the production<br>
of bleaching earths which avoid the formation of waste waters as<br>
well as processes for the recovery of the resulting waste waters<br>
do not lead to products which have an activity comparing to that<br>
of highly active bleaching earths or they can be produced with<br>
similar high efforts and costs as synthetic bleaching earths.<br>
The problem of disposing large amounts of acid waste waters con-<br>
taining large amounts of metal ions occurs not only in the manu-<br>
facture of highly active bleaching earths, but in a more gener-<br>
ally sense if minerals are leached with strong acids. Comparable<br>
difficulties exist, for example, also in the production of tita-<br>
nium dioxide, in which minerals are leached using sulphuric<br>
acid.<br>
The invention is therefore directed to solving the problem to<br>
provide a process for the recovery of acid suspensions whereby,<br>
on the one hand, valuable products are obtained which may be<br>
recycled into the economic cycle and, on the other hand, waste<br>
waters are obtained which may be disposed of simply and with<br>
little costs, and which especially have a minimum salt load.<br>
This problem is solved by a process with the features of claim<br>
1. Advantageous developments of the process of the invention are<br>
recited in the dependent claims.<br>
In the process according to the present invention for the recov-<br>
ery of an acid suspension containing at least one solid, first<br>
the acid suspension containing at least one solid which usually<br>
has a pH of less than 5, preferably less than 3, in particularly<br>
less than 1, is mixed with a alkali metal silicate solution,<br><br>
whereby a pH of more than about 4, preferably of more than about<br>
5 and most preferably more than about 6 is set in order to ob-<br>
tain a precipitate containing the alkali metal silicate and at<br>
least one solid. The formation of the precipitate generally<br>
takes place between pH 8 and pH 6. The starting alkali metal<br>
silicate solution generally has a pH of more than 10, in par-<br>
ticularly of more than 12.<br>
According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the inven-<br>
tion, the acid suspension containing at least one solid is added<br>
or titrated to an alkali metal silicate solution. Preferably,<br>
the mixing is carried at an increased temperature, especially at<br>
more than 70Â°C. Both a heated acid suspension containing at<br>
least one solid and/or a heated alkali metal silicate solution<br>
can be used, for example.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the above<br>
mixture, preferably after an aging or stabilization step, is<br>
further acidified by adding an acid to a pH of less than 4, in<br>
particular less than 3. The aging or stabilization step serves<br>
for the stabilization of the precipitate formed, wherein the<br>
mixture is stirred or allowed to stand for some time, preferably<br>
at least 1 hour, for example 1 to 2 hours. During the aging or<br>
stabilization step, the temperature is preferably maintained<br>
above 70Â°C. For example, the mixture according to claim 1(a) may<br>
also be brought to boiling. After the precipitation, the pre-<br>
cipitate containing the alkali metal silicate and the solid ma-<br>
terial is separated, optionally washed, dried and ground. Thus,<br>
the precipitate is a semi-synthetic product because it includes<br>
a portion based on the solid contained in the suspension, on the<br>
one hand, and a portion, which is based on the precipitation of<br>
silicic acid and optionally of the dissolved ions contained in<br>
the suspension. The last portion thus forms a "synthetic" por-<br>
tion, whereas the first portion is based on natural sources,<br><br>
such as natural clays. However, the solid must not have a natu-<br>
ral origin. It is also possible that the solid has been formed<br>
in a previous synthesis step.<br>
According to the process of the present invention, a well-<br>
filterable precipitate is obtained, and there are no difficul-<br>
ties during the separation of the precipitate or during the<br>
washing-out of, for example, the alkali metal ions, such diffi-<br>
culties usually occurring in the processing of gels. The pre-<br>
cipitate has a high porosity and a high specific surface area<br>
such that an adsorbent having a high bleaching activity is ob-<br>
tained by simple drying without the necessity of calcining the<br>
precipitate. This amounts to a substantial saving in energy and<br>
a cost reduction. Furthermore, when carrying out the process,<br>
waste waters are obtained which have a comparably low salt load<br>
whereby the disposal is substantially facilitated. Due to their<br>
low acid content, the suspensions and the waste waters have sig-<br>
nificantly lower corrosive properties.<br>
The process according to the present invention is, per se, suit-<br>
able for the processing of any other acid suspensions. Such acid<br>
suspensions are obtained in technical processes, e.g. during the<br>
leaching of minerals with acid. Examples for such technical<br>
processes are the production of titanium dioxide or the produc-<br>
tion of bleaching earths. Here, minerals are decomposed with<br>
strong acids, mostly sulphuric acid or hydrochloric acid,<br>
whereby large amounts of acid waste waters are formed.<br>
An acid suspension containing at least one solid is understood<br>
to be a suspension of at least one solid in a solvent, mostly<br>
water, which has an acid pH, preferably a pH of less than 3,<br>
most preferably of less than 1. The pH is preferably adjusted by<br>
the addition of acid. In principle, there are no limitations<br>
with respect to the selection of the acid and the solid(s).<br><br>
The acid suspension containing at least one solid is mixed with<br>
an aqueous alkali metal silicate solution. The alkali metal<br>
silicate solution is, as pointed out above, strongly basic, such<br>
that, by the addition of the suspension containing a solid, the<br>
acid contained in such suspension is at least partially neutral-<br>
ized. Generally, water glass is used as the alkali metal sili-<br>
cate solution, in particular a sodium water glass and/or a po-<br>
tassium water glass. The alkali metal silicate solution is pref-<br>
erably used in diluted form in order to obtain a uniform pre-<br>
cipitation. Preferably, the alkali metal silicate solution has a<br>
solids content of at least about 2 weight %, more preferably of<br>
at least about 5 weight %. The mixing of the acid suspension<br>
containing at least one solid and the alkali metal silicate so-<br>
lution is carried out such that the pH of the mixture has a<br>
value of more than about 4, preferably of more than about 5 and<br>
most preferably of more than about 6. Optionally, an acid or an<br>
alkaline substance may be added. Preferably, the pH of the mix-<br>
ture is not above pH 8, in particular not above pH 10. According<br>
to a preferred embodiment, the addition of the acid suspension<br>
containing at least one solid to the alkali metal silicate solu-<br>
tion is carried out during a time until the pH of the mixture<br>
has a value of more than about 4, in particular of more than<br>
about 5 and most preferably of more than about 6.<br>
After the formation of the precipitate containing the alkali<br>
metal silicate and the solid, the mixture, according to a pre-<br>
ferred embodiment of the invention, is re-acidified by the addi-<br>
tion of an acid, i.e. the pH is further reduced to values of<br>
less than 4, preferably less than 3. To this end, any acid may<br>
be used. Mineral acids, such as sulphuric acid, hydrochloric<br>
acid or nitric acid, are particularly suitable. It has been sur-<br>
prisingly found that the acidification facilitates the washing<br>
of the precipitate which is optionally carried out in a later<br>
production step. Furthermore, it was unexpectedly found that the<br><br>
re-acidification has a positive effect on the properties of the<br>
product, in particular with respect to the bleaching and degum-<br>
ming activity of the product.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the precipitation is car-<br>
ried out at increased temperatures, in particular at tempera-<br>
tures above 70Â°C. This may also be done by using a hot starting<br>
suspension containing at least one solid, or with a hot alkali<br>
metal silicate solution. After re-acidification, the mixture is<br>
preferably heated. Preferably, the suspension is maintained at a<br>
temperature of more than 70Â°C. Most preferably, this part of the<br>
reaction is conducted such that the suspension is heated to<br>
boiling. The time during which the acidified mixture is heated<br>
depends on the size of the batch and on the concentration of the<br>
components in the suspension. The suitable time can be simply<br>
determined by a person skilled in the art by taking samples.<br>
Generally, the acidified mixture is heated for at least 2 hours.<br>
For technical applications, reaction times in the range of more<br>
than 3 hours are generally selected.<br>
The precipitate containing the alkali metal silicate and the<br>
solid (s) is separated in a manner known to the person skilled in<br>
the art. This is usually done by filtration. However, other<br>
separation processes may also be used, for example a separation<br>
by sedimentation or by centrifugation. Since the precipitate<br>
formed during the process of the invention is made up of fine<br>
grains, i.e. no gel is formed in contrast to the above-mentioned<br>
processes, the filtration may be carried out in a relatively<br>
short time. No spray-drying as it is necessary in the prior art<br>
processes or the processing of waste waters for the preparation<br>
of artificial silicates is necessary in the process according to<br>
the invention. However, spray-drying is not excluded. The filter<br>
cake is further processed in the usual manner and, for example,<br>
washed and dried. Mostly, it is dried to a water content of less<br><br>
than 40 weight %, preferably of less than 30 weight %.   The dried<br>
filter cake can then be ground to the desired fineness using<br>
common equipment.<br>
Preferably, the acid suspension containing at least one solid<br>
contains metal ions with a valency of at least 2 in dissolved<br>
form. These metal ions are, for example, dissolved when minerals<br>
are leached with strong acids. By reaction with the; alkali metal<br>
silicate, these metal ions are then precipitated and thus re-<br>
moved from the solution. The solid particles contained in the<br>
suspension probably act as crystallization nuclei so that a<br>
fine-particle, filterable precipitate is obtained. Divalent and<br>
trivalent ions which may be contained in the aqueous phase of<br>
the suspension are for example Fe2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Al3+ and/or<br>
Fe3+. The concentration of the divalent and/or trivalent ions<br>
depends on the preparation of the suspension, for example on the<br>
duration and on the conditions under which the clays are leached<br>
with acid. The concentration of the divalent and/or trivalent<br>
ions can, for instance, correspond to a 0.3 to a 1.4 molar solu-<br>
tion. The anions contained in the aqueous phase of the suspen-<br>
sion depend upon the kind of the acid used for the decomposition<br>
of the minerals or for the acidification of the suspension. Ani-<br>
ons may, for instance, be sulfate ions. However, other ions,<br>
such as nitrate or chloride ions, may be contained, in particu-<br>
lar if nitric acid or hydrochloric acid has been used for the<br>
decomposition of the mineral.<br>
It is also possible to use mixtures of suspensions containing at<br>
least one solid or a solid may be added to an acid solution in<br>
order to obtain a suspension containing at least one solid.<br>
In particular, during the manufacture of bleaching earths, metal<br>
ions having a valency of at least 2 are formed from iron and/or<br>
aluminium ions which are dissolved from the raw clay when<br>
leached with strong acid.<br><br>
The solids content of the acid suspension containing at least<br>
one solid is selected so that the suspension may be processed<br>
without problems, for example may be stirred or pumped. There-<br>
fore, the suspension should preferably not have a too high vis-<br>
cosity. T.f swe] table minerals are used, such as sodium ben-<br>
tonite, the solids content of the acid suspension is therefore<br>
lower and the solids content with non-swellable minerals may be<br>
higher. The water content is preferably as low as possible, in<br>
order to reduce the amount of waste water. Preferably, the acid<br>
suspension containing at least one solid has a solids content of<br>
at least 10 weight %. In particular with non-swellable solids,<br>
the solids content, in many cases, will be higher than 20<br>
weight %, in particular higher than about 30 weight %.<br>
The acid content of the acid suspension containing at least one<br>
solid is mostly determined by the process in which the acid sus-<br>
pension containing at least one solid is formed, for instance<br>
during the leaching of minerals. The amount of acid is selected<br>
to be so high that a sufficient amount of acid is present to-<br>
wards the end of the leaching, in order to obtain a precipita-<br>
tion of the water glass. If the amount of acid in the suspension<br>
is too small prior to the addition of the alkali metal solution,<br>
a corresponding amount of acid may be added. Preferably, the<br>
acid suspension containing at least one solid, prior to the ad-<br>
dition of the alkali metal silicate, has an amount of acid of at<br>
least about 2.5 weight %, based upon the weight of the suspen-<br>
sion.<br>
The amount of acid of the acid suspension containing at least<br>
one solid is preferably supplied by hydrochloric acid and/or<br>
sulphuric acid. These acids are common for technical processes.<br>
However, other inorganic or organic acids may be contained in<br>
the acid suspension containing at least one solid. A further<br><br>
example for a suitable acid is nitric acid. An example for an<br>
organic acid is citric acid.<br>
The process of the invention is particularly suitable for the<br>
processing of suspensions obtained during the production of<br>
highly active bleaching earths. The acid suspension containing<br>
at least one solid is obtained by leaching a raw clay with<br>
(strong) acid. The raw clay is leached in a manner known per se<br>
as it is common in the manufacture of highly active bleaching<br>
earths. As raw clays, there may also be used minerals which are<br>
commonly used for the manufacture of highly active bleaching<br>
earths. All naturally active and non-naturally active raw clays<br>
familiar to the person skilled in the art may be used, in par-<br>
ticular di- or trioctahedral layer silicates of the serpentine,<br>
kaolin- and talcum-pyrophyrillite-group, smectites, vermicu-<br>
lites, illites and chlorites as well as of the sepiolithe-<br>
palygorskite-group such as montmorillonite, notronite, saponite<br>
and vermiculite or hectorite, beidellite, palygorskite and mixed<br>
layers minerals. Obviously, mixtures of two or several of the<br>
above materials may be used. For the leaching of the raw clays,<br>
mostly sulphuric or hydrochlorite acids are used.<br>
In order to obtain a most homogeneous precipitation, the mixing<br>
of the acid suspension containing at least one solid with the<br>
alkali metal silicate solution or a solution containing at least<br>
on alkali metal silicate preferably is carried out with stir-<br>
ring. In the preferred addition of the acid suspension contain-<br>
ing at least one solid to the alkali metal silicate solution,<br>
the rate of addition of the acid suspension is preferably se-<br>
lected such that the temperature of the mixture during the addi-<br>
tion of the acid suspension does not fall below 70Â°C. On the<br>
other hand, the acid suspension preferably is added at most at a<br>
rate such that the dissipation of the reaction heat formed dur-<br>
ing the neutralization is guaranteed.<br><br>
The alkali metal silicate solution is preferably a sodium or<br>
potassium water glass solution which is preferably used in a 3<br>
to 8% concentration. The water glass has preferably a molar<br>
Si02/M20 ratio of &gt; 2.0, wherein M is an alkali metal, in par-<br>
ticular potassium and/or sodium.<br>
By the mixing of the acid suspension containing at least one<br>
solid with the alkali metal silicate solution, the condensation<br>
of the silicic acid is induced. During the addition of acid af-<br>
ter the precipitation, the amount of acid is selected such that,<br>
related to the solids content after the precipitation, it is<br>
within a range of preferably at least 5 weight %, most prefera-<br>
bly at least 10 weight %.<br>
After separation, the precipitate may be washed, preferably un-<br>
til no soluble alkali metal is contained in the precipitate or<br>
in the washing water. Subsequently, the precipitate may be<br>
dried, a moisture of preferably less than 15 weight %   being ad-<br>
justed. The drying is carried out in the usual equipment, and<br>
the drying temperature should preferably not be higher than<br>
130Â°C. In some cases, the drying may also be carried out at<br>
higher temperatures.<br>
The precipitate obtained according to the process of the inven-<br>
tion (bleaching earth product) exhibits, after simple drying,<br>
i.e. without calcination, bleaching activities which correspond<br>
to or are even superior than those of high performance bleaching<br>
earths (HPBE). Thus, the precipitate is mostly not calcined. In<br>
indicidual cases, a calcination may be carried out, for example<br>
in order to increase the activity of the precipitate.<br>
The bleaching earth products made in this manner may, according<br>
to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, processed fur-<br>
ther by an additional acid activation to form highly efficient<br>
degumming agents. It has been shown that the additional acid<br><br>
activation will increase the adsorption efficiency further. To<br>
this end, the precipitate is preferably coated with small<br>
amounts of an inorganic or organic acid. The amount of acid se-<br>
lected, based upon the dried precipitate and dependent on the<br>
acid used, is preferably in a range from about 2 to 20 weight %,<br>
most preferably in a range from 3 to 15 weight %. Suitable acids<br>
are, for example, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid or citric<br>
acid. The coating may be carried out so that the acid, as an<br>
aqueous solution, is sprayed onto the precipitate. The activated<br>
precipitate obtained in such manner is then optionally dried<br>
again and ground in order to obtain a powder with the desired<br>
fineness.<br>
According to a particularly preferred embodiment, the acid acti-<br>
vation of the separated and dried precipitate is carried out<br>
with a solid organic acid. To this end, the precipitate is inti-<br>
mately mixed with the solid organic acid. The activation may be<br>
carried out by mixing the powder-like dry precipitate with the<br>
powder-like solid organic acid. After mixing, the product is<br>
ready for immediate use. Under dry conditions, it may be stored<br>
for several months. The mixing may also be carried out in such a<br>
way that the solid organic acid is ground together with the<br>
dried precipitate. By this embodiment of the process, a very<br>
uniform mixture is obtained. As solid organic acids, preferably<br>
organic acids are used which are at least dibasic, which e.g.<br>
comprise at least two carboxyl groups. Such carboxylic acids are<br>
normally present in solid form at normal conditions, i.e. at<br>
room temperature and normal pressure. Particularly suitable ac-<br>
ids are oxalic acid and citric acid. However, the selection<br>
should not be limited to the carboxylic acids mentioned. Other<br>
suitable acids include tartaric acid, succinic acid, malonic<br>
acid and malic acid. However, oxalic acid and citric acid are<br>
easily available and may be obtained in large amounts which is<br>
of importance under economical aspects. In particular, citric<br><br>
acid is acceptable for use in foods which is important in par-<br>
ticular for the raffination of edible oils and fats. The pre-<br>
cipitate, re-activated with acid, preferably with organic acid,<br>
may also be used as bleaching earth, in particular for the dis-<br>
coloration of oils and fats.<br>
The precipitate obtained with the process according to the pre-<br>
sent invention has a high adsorption capacity, in particular in<br>
the raffination of vegetable and animal oils and fats. There-<br>
fore, a subject of the invention is also an adsorbent which may<br>
be obtained with the above-described process. If a suspension<br>
obtained in the manufacture of highly active bleaching earths<br>
upon leaching the raw clays with a strong acids is used accord-<br>
ing to the invention, the adsorbent obtainable according to the<br>
invention preferably has a pore volume of more than 0.4 ml/g,<br>
preferably more than 0.5 ml/g, and a specific surface area of<br>
more than 250 m2/g, in particular about 300 to 600 m2/g, and a<br>
cation exchange capacity (CEC) of more than about 20 meq/lOOg.<br>
Furthermore, a subject of the invention includes the use of such<br>
an adsorbent as bleaching earth, in particular for the raffina-<br>
tion of vegetable and animal oils and fats, and the use of the<br>
adsorbent, optionally after additional treatment with acid(s),<br>
as degumming aid for the degumming of oils and fats.<br>
The invention is further illustrated by the examples.<br>
If in the examples a typical bleaching earth fineness is re-<br>
ferred to, such fineness is understood in which the dry sieve<br>
residue on a sieve having a mesh size of 63 urn is 20 to 40<br>
weight %, and the dry sieve residue on a sieve having a mesh<br>
size of 25 um is 50 to 65 weight %.<br><br>
Examples<br>
Description of the methods of analyses<br>
1. Surface area / pore volume<br>
The surface area was measured with a fully automized nitrogen<br>
porosimeter of Micromeritics, Type ASAP 2010, according to DIN<br>
66131. The pore volume was determined using the BJH method (E.P.<br>
Barrett, L.G. Joyner, P.P. Halenda, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 73 (1951)<br>
373) .<br>
2. Pore volume<br>
The pore volume was determined according to the CC14 method<br>
(H.A. Benesi, R.V. Bonnar, C.F. Lee, Anal. Chem. 27 (1955), page<br>
1963). To determine the pore volume, defined partial CC14 vapour<br>
pressures were set by mixing CC14 with paraffin.<br>
3._Analysis of the oils<br>
The colour numbers in oils (Lovibond-numbers) were determined<br>
according to AOCS Cc 13b-25. The determination of chlorophyll A<br>
was carried out according to AOCS Cc 13d-55. The oxidation sta-<br>
bility of the oils was tested using the analysis method AOCS Cd<br>
12b-92 (AOM: active oxygen method). The proportion of soap in<br>
oils was determined according to AOCS Cc 17-95. AOCS Cd 8-53 was<br>
used to determine the peroxide number. The content of metals and<br>
phosphorous in the oils was determined by ICP-analysis.<br><br>
4.	Water content<br>
the water content of the products at 105Â°C was determined using<br>
the method DIN/ISO-787/2.<br>
5.	Elemental analysis<br>
The analysis is based on a total decomposition of the minerals<br>
or the corresponding semi-synthetic bleaching earth products.<br>
After the solid had been brought into solution, the individual<br>
components were analysed and quantified with specific analysis<br>
methods, such as ICP-spectroscopy.<br>
6.	Cation exchange capacity<br>
To determine the cation exchange capacity (CEC), the layer sili-<br>
cate to be tested was dried at 150Â°C for 2 hours. Then, the<br>
dried material was refluxed with an excess of aqueous 2N NH4C1<br>
solution and reacted. After a standing time of 16 hours at room<br>
temperature, the product was filtered, the filter cake was<br>
washed, dried and ground, and the NH4 content in the layer sili-<br>
cate was analysed by nitrogen determination (CHN-analyzer of<br>
Leco). The proportion and the kind of exchanged metal ions in<br>
the filtrate was determined by ICP spectroscopy.<br>
Manufacturing examples<br>
1. Preparation of a semi-synthetic neutralized bleaching earth<br>
(SSN)<br>
Prior to the synthesis, a 5 weight % water glass solution was<br>
produced. To  this end, 1.084 kg NaSiO3 solution (dry weight<br>
489 g) were diluted with 8.69 1 water. A water glass solution<br><br>
was used, in which the SiO2/Na2O ratio was 2.6, and which con-<br>
tained 45.1 weight % solid. The water glass had the following<br>
composition: 23.9 weight % Si02, 9.19 weight % Na20.<br>
1.700 kg of a hot activation suspension from a typical bleaching<br>
earth production was added to the dilute water glass solution.<br>
This suspension was prepared by boiling a montmorillonite-<br>
containing raw clay with 45 weight % sulphuric acid (based on<br>
the solid content of the raw clay) for 8 hours and had a solid<br>
content of 30 weight %. The combination of the water glass and<br>
the activation slurry was carried out under moderate stirring<br>
until a pH of 6 had been reached. Care was taken that the tem-<br>
perature did not drop below 70Â°C during the neutralization. The<br>
resulting mixture was contacted with 10 weight % concentrated<br>
H2S04 (based on the solid in the neutralized solution) and<br>
heated to boiling temperature for 2 hours. A pH of about 2.5 was<br>
reached. Subsequently, the resulting mixture was separated by<br>
filtration and the filtered material was washed with a total of<br>
7.78 1 water. The resulting solid was pre-dried to about 30<br>
weight % and ground in a hammer mill to a typical bleaching<br>
earth fineness (dry sieve residue on 63 um sieve 20 to 40 weight<br>
%). Subsequently, the bleaching earth powder was dried to a wa-<br>
ter content of about 10 weight %. This bleaching earth product<br>
will hereinafter be called "SSN".<br>
The cation exchange capacity (CEC) of SSN was 41.2 meq/g. The<br>
exchangeable cations are summarized in table Ia. The elemental<br>
analysis of SSN is summarized in table Ib.<br><br><br><br>
2.	Coating of SSN with phosphoric acid (preparation of SSP)<br>
A part of the bleaching earth product SSN obtained in example 1<br>
was coated with 10 weight % phosphoric acid (58 weight %) by<br>
uniform spraying. The product thus produced will hereinafter be<br>
called "SSP".<br>
3.	Coating of SSN with sulphuric acid (preparation of SSS)<br>
In analogy to the production example 2, a bleaching earth prod-<br>
uct "SSS" was prepared by coating the bleaching earth product<br>
SSN from example 1 with 3 weight % sulphuric acid (84.2 weight<br>
%) by spraying.<br>
4.	Mixing of SSN with citric acid (preparation of SSC)<br>
6.4   weight % citric acid (citric acid anhydrate) in typical<br>
bleaching earth fineness was added to the bleaching earth prod-<br>
uct of example 1. The two solids were homogeneously mixed by<br>
vigorous shaking in a closed glass container.<br><br><br>
The products TonsilÂ® Supreme 126 FF, SorbamolÂ® 420  FF (both Sud-<br>
Chemie de Mexico) and TriSylÂ® 3000 (W.R. Grace) mentioned in table<br>
II are typical commercially available representatives of bleaching<br>
earths or adsorbents. TonsilÂ® Supreme 12 6 FF is a highly active<br>
bleaching earth (HPBE, "high performance bleaching earth") on the<br>
basis of montmorillonite; TriSylÂ® 3000 and SorbamolÂ® 420 FF are<br>
synthetic degumming aids.<br><br>
The products TonsilÂ® Supreme 126 FF, TriSylÂ® 3000 and SorbamolÂ® 420 FF are<br>
further explained below :<br>
TonsilÂ® Supreme 126 FF is a highly active bleaching earth (HPBE, "high performance<br>
bleaching earth") as is also explained on page 21, in the paragraph following table II.<br>
Such HPBE are obtained by suspending a raw clay, e.g. montmorillonite, in strong<br>
inorganic acids and leaching the clay at increased temperatures as is also explained on<br>
page 4, lines 4 to 9 of the application.<br>
TriSylÂ® 3000 is an amorphous silica gel. This is also explained on page 23, line 7 of<br>
the application.<br>
SorbamolÂ® 420 FF is an acid-activated montmorillonite clay.<br>
5. Comparison of the waste water of SSN and conventional<br>
bleaching earth products<br>
In table III the amounts of waste water and of the salt concentration dissolved therein,<br>
from the preparation of SSN, were<br>
5. Comparison of the waste water of SSN and conventional<br>
bleaching earth products<br>
In table III the amounts of waste water and of the salt concen-<br>
tration dissolved therein, from the preparation of SSN, were<br>
compared with the waste water obtained in the production of a<br>
bleaching earth on the basis of montmorillonite according to the<br>
prior art processes (activation of montmorillonite with 45<br>
weight % sulphuric acid for 8 h).<br><br><br>
Despite of the somewhat increased waste water volume, the waste<br>
water in the process according to the present invention contains<br>
less dissolved salts (40 vs. 151 g/1). The waste water has a<br>
higher pH and a lower amount of free H2S04. Accordingly, this<br>
waste water is less corrosive than the waste water from the<br>
prior art production process. After the neutralization of the<br>
waste water with lime milk, the present process only yields<br>
15 g/1 solid to be disposed of, whereas the prior art process<br>
yields 192 g/1.<br>
In the process of the present invention, a significantly smaller<br>
salt load in the waste water is obtained with similar process<br>
conditions.<br>
1. Bleaching of canola oils with SSN<br>
Degummed canola oil was bleached at 100Â°C for 30 min under vac-<br>
uum using the bleaching earth obtained in example 1. For the<br>
bleaching, 0.4 weight % bleaching earth were metered to the<br>
heated oil. For comparison of the bleaching results with the<br>
prior art, the commercial bleaching earth product TonsilÂ® Su-<br><br>
preme 126 FF and the commercial silica gel product TriSylÂ© 3000<br>
were used. The bleaching results are summarized in table IV.<br>
They show the equivalency of SSN over a bleaching earth on the<br>
basis of montmorillonite and show the inferior bleaching effect<br>
of silica gels.<br><br>
2. Degumming of soybean oil with the products of the invention<br>
A non-refined raw soybean oil was treated at 70Â°C for 20 min<br>
with the products listed in table V. After the treatment time,<br>
the solid was filtered off, and the oil was analysed for soap<br>
and heavy metal content. Table V illustrates that the products<br>
of the invention remove soaps and heavy metals significantly<br>
better than commercially available products.<br><br><br>
3. Degumming and bleaching of soybean oil<br>
Raw soybean oil was pre-treated with 0.025 weight % degumming<br>
agent at 70Â°C for 20 min. Subsequently, 0.5 weight % bleaching<br>
earth of the type TonsilÂ® Supreme 126 FF were added, and the oil<br>
was treated at 115Â°C for 30 min under a vacuum of 60 mm Hg. After<br>
filtering off the adsorbent, the bleached oil is obtained which<br>
was subsequently deodorized at 270Â°C for 120 min and a pressure<br>
of 2 mm Hg. Table VI shows the analysis of the bleached and de-<br>
odorized oils.<br><br><br><br>
The results of example 3 show that the products according to the<br>
invention may be used in the combination of degumming and<br>
bleaching of raw oils with particularly high efficiency. In par-<br>
ticular, the (oxidation)stability of the deodorized oil reaches,<br>
to a certain part, significantly better values as with the de-<br>
gumming/bleaching of prior art products.<br><br>
