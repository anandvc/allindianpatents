				<td>The present invention relates to disinfectant and/or bactericidal aqueous compositions.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to disinfectant and/or bactericidal aqueous compositions containing an olanexidine acid addition salt.<br>
BACKGROUND ART These days, people and articles frequently travel throughout the world, and hence there is an increased risk of pathogenic microorganisms that were previously restricted to a specific region or country being brought into all places throughout the world. Moreover, in modern life, people become increasingly hygiene-oriented and a hygienic environment has come to be provided. On the contrary, however, it is said that people's immune function is dropping.<br>
Under the circumstances, to protect people and animals from pathogenic microorganisms, there are demands for the development of disinfectants/bactericides that are safe and easy to use, and have stronger effects.<br>
Olanexidine [1- (3,4-dichlorobenzyl)-5-octylbiguanide] and salts thereof are compounds having disinfectant/bactericidal action that have been developed to meet the above demands, and have a broader antibacterial spectrum than hitherto known monobiguanide derivatives (see Japanese Patent No. 2662343, claim 1, paragraphs 0018, 0019, 0067, etc.). In Japanese Patent No. 2662343, it is proposed that when a monobiguanide derivative or a salt thereof is used as a disinfectant, a prescribed amount thereof is dissolved, dispersed or suspended in a medium such as water or an organic solvent, thus obtaining a liquid preparation for external use, for example eye drops, nasal drops, a gargle, a cleansing agent or an abluent.<br>
Olanexidine is a basic compound, and hence forms acid<br><br>
addition salts. However, for example, the solubility of<br>
olanexidine hydrochloride in water is extremely low and is 0.02<br>
W/V% at 0°C, and at this concentration the bactericidal activity<br>
is prone to being influenced by various factors such as pH, serum,<br>
soap, temperature and so on. Therefore, there have been strong<br>
demands for an aqueous preparation that is not prone to being<br>
influenced by these factors and contains olanexidine or a salt<br>
thereof dissolved in high concentrations.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
As described above, olanexidine and salts thereof are<br>
useful as disinfectants and/or bactericides, but it is considered<br>
that the usefulness would be increased by further improving the<br>
following points.<br>
That is, because disinfectants and/or bactericides are<br>
widely used as liquid preparations, if a preparation containing<br>
olanexidine or a salt thereof as a principal agent could be<br>
prepared in as high a concentration as possible, then this would<br>
be advantageous in terms of the bactericidal effect and<br>
convenience of use. Such a high-concentration preparation may be<br>
used as such in situations in which a strong bactericidal action<br>
is required, or may be used as a formulated solution to be<br>
diluted at the time of use, in which case the preparation volume<br>
can be reduced, which is advantageous from the standpoint of its<br>
distribution and storage.<br>
A suitable dissolution aid is required to make the<br>
olanexidine concentration high, but for the preparation<br>
containing the dissolution aid, the high bactericidal action of<br>
the olanexidine must be maintained stably, the skin irritation<br>
must be suppressed as much as possible, and the preparation must<br>
be easy to use.<br>
However, up to now, no high-concentration preparation of<br>
olanexidine or a salt thereof has been known for which the<br>
olanexidine is dissolved in the medium in high concentration, the<br>
bactericidal action is maintained high, and the skin irritability<br>
is low. It is thus an object of the present invention to provide<br>
such high-concentration preparations of olanexidine or a salt<br>
thereof.<br>
To attain the above object, the present inventors carried<br>
out various researches on dissolution aids for dissolving an<br>
olanexidine acid addition salt, and as a result discovered that<br>
the above object can be attained by dissolving an olanexidine<br>
acid addition salt in a water-containing solvent in the presence<br>
of at least one polyoxyethylene-based nonionic surfactant<br>
selected from the group consisting of polyoxyethylene higher<br>
alkyl ethers and polyoxyethylene alkylphenyl ethers.<br>
Based on these findings, the present inventors carried out<br>
further researches, and accomplished disinfectant and/or<br>
bactericidal aqueous compositions of the present invention<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "compositions of invention I").<br>
That is, a composition of invention I is disinfectant<br>
and/or bactericidal aqueous composition containing an olanexidine<br>
acid addition salt, and at least one polyoxyethylene-based<br>
nonionic surfactant selected from the group consisting of<br>
polyoxyethylene higher alkyl ethers and polyoxyethylene<br>
alkylphenyl ethers.<br>
Examples of the polyoxyethylene higher alkyl ethers are<br>
compounds represented by formula (1):<br>
wherein RI represents an alkyl group having 7 to 20 carbon atoms,<br>
and m represents an integer from 9 to 12.<br>
Examples of the polyoxyethylene alkylphenyl ethers are<br>
compounds represented by formula (2):<br>
wherein R2 represents an alkyl group having 7 to 20 carbon atoms,<br>
and n represents an integer from 9 to 12.<br>
A preferable composition of invention I is an aqueous<br>
composition containing an olanexidine acid addition salt at a<br>
concentration of 0.05 to 5 W/V%, and a polyoxyethylene-based<br>
nonionic surfactant at a concentration of 0.1 to 10 W/V%.<br>
The composition of invention I contains water as a solvent,<br>
and may further contain an alcohol insofar as it does not<br>
adversely affect the effect of the invention. When an alcohol is<br>
used, the concentration of the alcohol in the composition is 30<br>
to 80 W/V%, preferably 60 to 80 W/V%. Examples of the alcohol<br>
include ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, denatured alcohol etc.<br>
Particularly ethyl alcohol is preferable.<br>
Moreover, the present inventors also discovered that in a<br>
prescribed ethyl alcohol aqueous solution, a certain amount of<br>
olanexidine acid addition salt can be dissolved even in the<br>
absence of surfactants, and the disinfectant/bactericidal effect<br>
is improved.<br>
Based on these findings, the present inventors carried out<br>
further researches, and accomplished disinfectant and/or<br>
bactericidal aqueous compositions of the present invention<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "compositions of invention II"}.<br>
That is, a composition of invention II is an aqueous<br>
composition containing an olanexidine acid addition salt at a<br>
concentration of 0.05 to 0.5 W/V%, and an alcohol at a<br>
concentration of 20 to 80 W/V%, and not containing any<br>
surfactants. The concentration of the alcohol in the composition<br>
of invention II is preferably in the range of 30 to 60 W/V%.<br>
Examples of the alcohol include ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol,<br>
denatured alcohol etc., and particularly ethyl alcohol is<br>
preferable.<br>
Typically, the composition of invention II contains an<br>
olanexidine acid addition salt at a concentration of 0.05 to 0.5<br>
W/V%, and an alcohol at a concentration of 20 to 80 W/V%, and not<br>
containing any surfactants.<br>
Furthermore, the present inventors discovered that the<br>
above object can be attained by dissolving an olanexidine acid<br>
addition salt in water in the presence of at least one member<br>
selected from the group consisting of ester-based nonionic<br>
surfactants and cyclic oligosaccharides.<br>
Based on these findings, the present inventors carried out<br>
further researches, and accomplished disinfectant and/or<br>
bactericidal aqueous compositions of the present invention<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention will be described in detail.<br>
Olanexidine acid addition salt<br>
"olanexidine acid addition salt" in the disinfectant and/or<br>
bactericidal aqueous composition of the present invention means a<br>
salt of olanexidine and an acid (organic acid or inorganic acid).<br>
There are no particular restrictions on the acid forming<br>
the salt. Examples are organic acids such as formic acid, acetic<br>
acid, lactic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, ocmercaptopropionic<br>
acid, trifluoroacetic acid, malic acid, fumaric<br>
acid, succinic acid, succinic monoamide, glutamic acid, tartaric<br>
acid, oxalic acid, citric acid, glycolic acid, gluconic acid,<br>
saccharic acid, ascorbic acid, penicillin, benzole acid, phthalic<br>
acid, salicylic acid, anthranilic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, ptoluenesulfonic<br>
acid or methansulfonic acid, and inorganic acids<br>
such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid,<br>
phosphoric acid, nitric acid or carbonic acid. Moreover, there<br>
are no particular restrictions on the ratio between olanexidine<br>
and the acid forming the acid addition salt; in addition to 1:1,<br>
salts with various other ratios such as 1:2 can be used.<br>
The acid addition salt is manufactured using an ordinary<br>
salt forming method such as directly mixing the acid and<br>
olanexidine together, dissolving one or both of the acid and<br>
olanexidine in a solvent such as water in advance and then mixing<br>
the solvent together, or putting the acid and olanexidine into a<br>
solvent such as water and carrying out dissolution and mixing.<br>
Note that the acid addition salts of olanexidine indicated<br>
here can be used in any of the compositions of inventions I to<br>
III described below. In each composition of invention I to III,<br>
the olanexidine acid addition salt is dissolved in the solvent<br>
containing water and if desired, an alcohol. In this solution,<br>
the olanexidine and the acid may form a salt, or the two may<br>
exist in the free form, or the gluconic acid salt of olanexidine<br>
may coexist with free olanexidine and free gluconic acid.<br>
Compositions of invention I<br>
A composition of invention I is a disinfectant and/or<br>
bactericidal aqueous composition containing an olanexidine acid<br>
addition salt, and at least one polyoxyethylene-based nonionic<br>
surfactant selected from the group consisting of polyoxyethylene<br>
higher alkyl ethers and polyoxyethylene alkylphenyl ethers.<br>
The concentration of the olanexidine acid addition salt in<br>
the composition of invention I is preferably 0.05 to 5 W/V% in<br>
the composition. In this concentration range, the composition has<br>
a high disinfectant/bactericidal effect and a viscosity<br>
convenient to use. The concentration of the olanexidine acid<br>
addition salt is preferably in the range of 0.05 to 3.5 W/V%,<br>
more preferably 0.05 to 2 W/V%.<br>
In the composition of invention I, the polyoxyethylenebased<br>
nonionic surfactant is selected from the group consisting<br>
of polyoxyethylene higher alkyl ethers and polyoxyethylene<br>
alkylphenyl ethers.<br>
Preferable examples of the above-mentioned polyoxyethylene<br>
higher alkyl ethers are surfactants represented by previously<br>
mentioned formula (1), wherein the alkyl group represented by RI<br>
has 7 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably 9 to 14 carbon atoms, and<br>
include nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, tridecyl and tetradecyl.<br>
Moreover, a mixture of a plurality of polyoxyethylene higher<br>
alkyl ethers having such alkyl groups may also be used. In the<br>
formula (1), m is a polymerization degree of oxyethylene unit<br>
(OE), and is an integer from 9 to 12.<br>
Specific examples of such a surfactant include POE (9)<br>
lauryl ether (e.g., 'BL-9EX' made by Nikko Chemicals Co., Ltd.),<br>
POE (10) lauryl ether (e.g. 'Emulmin NL-100' made by Sanyo<br>
Chemical Industries, Ltd.) and POE (12) alkyl ether (e.g.<br>
vSannonic SS-120' made by Sanyo Chemical Industries, Ltd.). Here,<br>
the number in brackets after 'POE' indicates a polymerization<br>
degree of OE, i.e. m in formula (1).<br>
Preferable examples of polyoxyethylene alkylphenyl ethers<br>
are surfactants represented by previously mentioned formula (2),<br>
wherein the alkyl group represented by R2 has 7 to 20 carbon<br>
atoms, preferably 9 to 14 carbon atoms, with specific examples<br>
being the same group as the alkyl group represented by RI<br>
described above. In the formula (2), n is a polymerization degree<br>
of oxyethylene unit (OE), and is an integer from 9 to 12.<br>
Specific examples of such surfactants are POE (10)<br>
nonylphenyl ether and POE (10) octylphenyl ether. Here, the<br>
number in brackets after XPOE' indicates a polymerization degree<br>
of OE, i.e. n in formula (2).<br>
The composition of invention I contains such a<br>
polyoxyethylene-based nonionic surfactant in a solvent containing<br>
water, and therefore, it can be easily prepared as a liquid<br>
preparation having the olanexidine acid addition salt dissolved<br>
therein at a high concentration. Moreover the composition of<br>
invention I is such a preparation that the skin irritation can be<br>
suppressed and good feeling in use with good lubricity can be<br>
obtained.<br>
The concentration of the polyoxyethylene-based nonionic<br>
surfactant in the composition of invention I is preferably 0.1 to<br>
10 W/V%, particularly 0.15 to 6.5 W/V%, in the composition.<br>
Within such a range of the surfactant concentration, the<br>
disinfectant/bactericidal effect of the olanexidine acid addition<br>
salt can be stably maintained.<br>
To make the composition of invention I into a liquid<br>
preparation, a solvent is required for dissolving the olanexidine<br>
acid addition salt in the presence of the polyoxyethylene-based<br>
nonionic surfactant. The solvent is preferably water, or a<br>
mixture of water and an alcohol (e.g., ethyl alcohol, isopropyl<br>
alcohol, denatured alcohol etc.). More preferable solvent is an<br>
aqueous solution of an alcohol, particularly an aqueous solution<br>
of ethyl alcohol. In this case, the concentration of ethyl<br>
alcohol present in the composition is advantageously in the range<br>
of 30 to 80 W/V%, preferably 60 to 80 W/V%. By making the ethyl<br>
alcohol concentration be within such a range, the liquid<br>
preparation containing the above-mentioned components can be made<br>
uniform, and can be used very conveniently because of its rapid<br>
disinfectant/bactericidal action at the time of use and its quick<br>
drying after use.<br>
Thus, the composition of invention I is typically an<br>
aqueous composition. The aqueous composition is an aqueous<br>
solution of an olanexidine acid addition salt and a<br>
polyoxyethylene-based nonionic surfactant, the oranexidine acid<br>
addition salt being present at a concentration of 0.05 to 5 W/V%<br>
and the polyoxyethylene-based nonionic surfactant being present<br>
at a concentration of 0.1 to 10 W/V%.<br>
Alternatively, the composition of invention I may be an<br>
alcohol-containing aqueous composition. Said alcohol-containing<br>
aqueous composition is a composition that is the same as the<br>
above aqueous composition except that a mixture of water and an<br>
alcohol (particularly ethyl alcohol) is used in place of water as<br>
the solvent. Typically, said alcohol-containing aqueous<br>
composition is an aqueous solution of an olanexidine acid<br>
addition salt, a polyoxyethylene-based nonionic surfactant and an<br>
alcohol (particularly ethyl alcohol), the oranexidine acid<br>
addition salt being present at a concentration of 0.05 to 5 W/V%,<br>
the polyoxyethylene-based nonionic surfactant being present at a<br>
concentration of 0.1 to 10 W/V% and the alcohol (particularly<br>
ethyl alcohol) being present at a concentration of 30 to 80 W/V%,<br>
preferably 60 to 80 W/V%.<br>
In addition to the above components, if necessary, various<br>
other components may be included in the composition of invention<br>
I for the purpose of further improving the product quality.<br>
For example, from the viewpoint of improving the skin<br>
protecting ability and moisturizing ability, one or more fatty<br>
acid triglycerides and, if necessary,<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose are preferably included. By<br>
including such components, the effect of suppressing skin<br>
irritation is enhanced particularly in the case of using a<br>
solvent containing ethyl alcohol.<br>
Regarding the above-mentioned one or more fatty acid<br>
triglycerides, any ones ordinarily used in the field of<br>
medicines/disinfectants can be used with no particular<br>
limitations thereto. In general, ones that are liquid at<br>
atmospheric pressure and normal temperatures around 20°C are<br>
preferable; examples are triglycerides of fatty acids such as<br>
isooctanoic acid, caprylic acid, capric acid, lauric acid,<br>
myristic acid, palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, stearic acid,<br>
isostearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid;<br>
one of these fatty acid triglycerides may be used alone, or two<br>
or more can be used in combination. Furthermore, a triglyceride<br>
having a vegetable oil such as olive oil or rapeseed oil as a raw<br>
material thereof may be used.<br>
Out of the above-mentioned fatty acid triglycerides,<br>
especially isooctanoic acid triglyceride can be preferably<br>
selected because of its high safety and its better feeling in use.<br>
Said one or more fatty acid triglycerides, when used, is<br>
preferably present at a concentration of 0.01 to 10 W/V%,<br>
particularly at a concentration in the range of 0.3 to 3 W/V%, in<br>
the composition. If the concentration is within such a range,<br>
then the moisturizing effect and the effect of suppressing skin<br>
irritation, skin roughness and so on will be exhibited<br>
sufficiently, and virtually no stickiness will remain on the<br>
surface of the skin.<br>
In the case of using hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, it is<br>
preferable that the concentration thereof in the composition is<br>
in the range of 0.001 to 1.0 W/V%, particularly 0.005 to 0.5 W/V%.<br>
Furthermore, one or more components conventionally added to<br>
disinfectants/bactericides can be added to the composition of<br>
invention I so long as the object thereof is not impaired. As<br>
described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 11-199476,<br>
examples thereof are blood circulation promoters such as<br>
propylene carbonate, W-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (Japanese<br>
Pharmaceutical Excipients), propylene glycol, polysorbate 80<br>
(Japanese Pharmacopoeia), and tocopherol acetate; tissue<br>
recovering agents such as allantoin; refreshing agents such as<br>
peppermint oil and 1-menthol; oily components such as liquid<br>
paraffin, methyl polysiloxane, methyl phenyl polysiloxane, and<br>
squalane; polyhydric alcohol such as glycerol, 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol, and sorbitol; pH regulators; etc.<br>
The pH of the composition of invention I is preferably 4 to<br>
8, more preferably 5 to 6, in the form of a formulated solution<br>
to be diluted at the time of use. If the pH is adjusted to such a<br>
range, then the composition will have good stability, and the<br>
feeling in use will be good.<br>
The composition of invention I can be prepared, for example,<br>
by adding water to the olanexidine acid addition salt (e.g.<br>
olanexidine hydrochloride) and the polyoxyethylene-based nonionic<br>
surfactant(s) and carrying out mixing and dissolution, adjusting<br>
the mixture to a pH of approximately 4 to 8 using an acid such as<br>
dilute hydrochloric acid or the like. Such a composition can be<br>
used for disinfection or sterilization. If necessary, with such a<br>
composition being used as a formulated solution to be diluted at<br>

concentration can be prepared by diluting the composition with<br>
water or the like.<br>

surfactants in the composition. The alcohol concentration is<br>
preferably 30 to 60 W/V%. Examples of the alcohol include ethyl<br>

composition containing an olanexidine acid addition salt at a<br>
concentration of 0.05 to 0.5 W/V% and an alcohol at a<br>

surfactants.<br>
In addition to the above components, if necessary, various<br>
other components may be included in the composition of invention<br>
II for the purpose of further improving the product quality.<br>
For example, from the viewpoint of improving the skin<br>
protecting ability and moisturizing ability, one or more fatty<br>
acid triglycerides and, if necessary,<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose are preferably included. By<br>
including such components, the effect of suppressing skin<br>
irritation is enhanced particularly in the case of using a<br>
solvent containing ethyl alcohol.<br>
Regarding the above-mentioned one or more fatty acid<br>
triglycerides, any ones ordinarily used in the field of<br>
medicines/disinfectants can be used with no particular<br>

material thereof may be used.<br>
Out of the above-mentioned fatty acid triglycerides,<br>

selected because of its high safety and its better feeling in use.<br>
Said one or more fatty acid triglycerides, when used, is<br>
preferably present at a concentration of 0.01 to 10 W/V%,<br>
particularly at a concentration in the range of 0.3 to 3 W/V%, in<br>
the composition. If the concentration is within such a range,<br>
then the moisturizing effect and the effect of suppressing skin<br>
irritation, skin roughness and so on will be exhibited<br>
sufficiently, and virtually no stickiness will remain on the<br>
surface of the skin.<br>
In the case of using hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, it is<br>
preferable that the concentration thereof in the composition is<br>
in the range of 0.001 to 1.0 W/V%, particularly 0.005 to 0.5 W/V%.<br>
Furthermore, one or more components conventionally added to<br>

paraffin, methyl polysiloxane, methyl phenyl polysiloxane, and<br>
squalane; polyhydric alcohol such as glycerol, 1,3-butylene<br>

The composition of invention II can be prepared, for<br>
example, by mixing the olanexidine acid addition salt (e.g.,<br>
olanexidine hydrochloride) in an alcohol aqueous solution (e.g.,<br>
50 to 90% ethanol aqueous solution) and carrying out dissolution,<br>
and adjusting the solution to a pH of approximately 4 to 8 using<br>
an acid such as dilute hydrochloric acid or the like. Such a<br>
composition can be used for disinfection or sterilization. If<br>
necessary, with such a composition being used as a formulated<br>
solution to be diluted at the time of use, a liquid preparation<br>
having a prescribed concentration can be prepared by diluting the<br>
composition with water or the like.<br>

Regarding the above-mentioned one or more fatty acid<br>

Said one or more fatty acid triglycerides, when used, is<br>
preferably present at a concentration of 0.01 to 10 W/V%,<br>
particularly at a concentration in the range of 0.3 to 3 W/V%, in<br>

to 8, more preferably 5 to 6, in the form of a formulated<br>
solution to be diluted at the time of use. If the pH is adjusted<br>
to such a range, then the liquid preparation will have good<br>

The composition of invention III can be prepared, for<br>
example, by adding water to the olanexidine acid addition salt<br>
(e.g., olanexidine hydrochloride) and at least one member<br>
selected from the group consisting of the ester-based nonionic<br>
surfactant and cyclic oligosaccharide, carrying out mixing and<br>
dissolution, adjusting the mixture to a pH of approximately 4 to<br>

can be used for disinfection or sterilization. If necessary, with<br>
such a composition being used as a formulated solution to be<br>
diluted at the time of use, a liquid preparation having a<br>
prescribed concentration can be prepared by diluting the<br>
composition with a solvent such as water or an alcohol.<br>
Application of the compositions of inventions I to III<br>
The disinfectant and/or bactericidal aqueous compositions<br>

bacteria such as Staphylococci, Streptococci, Enterococci, and<br>
Listeria and Propionibacterium spp; and gram-negative bacteria<br>
such as Escherichia coli, Shigella, Salmonella, Citrobacter,<br>
Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia, Proteus, Morganella, Yersinia,<br>
Vibrio, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Neisseria, Haemophilus, and<br>
Bacteroides spp.<br>
The composition also has an antiviral activity for virus<br>
with envelope such as Influenza virus, Human immunodeficiency<br>
virus, Herpes simplex virus, and Vesicular stomatitis virus, and<br>
has antifungal activity on yeast-like fungi such as Candida spp,<br>
Cryptococcus neoformans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.<br>
The disinfectant and/or bactericidal aqueous composition of<br>
the present invention means an agent that can be widely used for<br>
the purpose of killing, decreasing, inhibiting etc. the various<br>
microbes such as described above.<br>
The composition of the present invention exhibits<br>
bactericidal or disinfectant activity by contacting an object<br>
containing the microbes with an effective amount of the<br>
composition. Contacting methods are not particularly limited, and<br>
specific examples thereof include immersion, spraying, dry bath,<br>
etc. Examples of the object include skin and/or hands of human,<br>
animal skin, medical equipment, lavatories, bathrooms, furniture,<br>
articles and so on.<br>
Therefore, the composition of the present invention can be<br>
suitably used for disinfecting skin/hands, preoperative skin,<br>
skin wounded, medical equipment, operating rooms, sickrooms,<br>
furniture, equipment and other articles, etc.<br>
Moreover, the composition of the present invention may be<br>
used by impregnating it in a base fabric. Examples of such base<br>
fabrics include cotton wool, gauze, paper, non-woven cloths,<br>
towels, other cloths and so on. Usable such base fabrics may be<br>
water-decomposable or non-water-decomposable.<br>
The composition of the present invention, which contains an<br>
olanexidine acid addition salt (olanexidine hydrochloride etc.)<br>
in a high concentration, can be used as a stock solution, and<br>
also can be used by diluting it with water or the like in<br>
accordance with the application.<br>
EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
With a composition of invention I, the olanexidine acid<br>
addition salt as a principal agent can be dissolved in a solvent<br>
at a high concentration under the presence of at least one<br>
specific polyoxyethylene-based nonionic surfactant. Moreover, the composition of invention I maintains a high solubility of<br>
olanexidine acid addition salt with no reduction in the<br>
bactericidal activity thereof, has suppressed skin irritation,<br>
and exhibits a rapid bactericidal effect and a quick-drying<br>
property. Therefore, the composition can be widely used as<br>
disinfectant and/or bactericidal composition.<br>
With an olanexidine acid addition salt alone, the<br>
solubility in a water is low, and the bactericidal activity is<br>
prone to being influenced by pH, organic matter, soap,<br>
temperature and so on. According to the composition of invention<br>
I, however, such influence can be eliminated, and hence the<br>
practical usefulness can be improved.<br>
With a composition of invention II, the concentration of<br>
the olanexidine acid addition salt is not so high, but the<br>
disinfectant/bactericidal effect can be rapidly exhibited, and<br>
the rapidity of drying after use can be enhanced.<br>
With a composition of invention III, the olanexidine acid<br>
addition salt as a principal agent can be dissolved in a solvent<br>
at a high concentration by using at least one member selected<br>
from the group consisting of an ester -based nonionic surfactant<br>
and a cyclic oligosaccharide. Compared with the composition using<br>
the olanexidine acid addition salt alone, the bactericidal<br>
activity of the composition of invention III is thus increased,<br>
and a bactericidal effect can be exhibited even in a short time.<br>
With an olanexidine acid addition salt alone, the<br>
solubility in a water is low, and the bactericidal activity is<br>
prone to being influenced by pH, organic matter, soap,<br>
temperature and so on. According to the composition of invention<br>
III, however, such influence can be eliminated, and hence the<br>
practical usefulness can be improved. Moreover, with the<br>
composition of invention III, skin irritation is suppressed.<br>

carried out, the pH was adjusted to 6, and then water was further<br>
added to give a total volume of 100 mL, thus obtaining a<br>
disinfectant and/or bactericidal aqueous composition.<br>
The aqueous solutions obtained in Examples 1 to 5 were<br>
still transparent and colorless without precipitation even after<br>
being left at a temperature in the vicinity of 0°C<br>
Control Example I<br>
74 ml of ethanol for disinfection was added to 2.5 ml of a<br>
20 W/V% chlorhexidine gluconate aqueous solution (Sumitomo<br>
Pharmaceuticals Company Limited) and mixing and dissolution were<br>
carried out sufficiently, the pH was adjusted to 6.0 using<br>
gluconic acid, and then water was added to give a total volume of<br>
100 mL, thus obtaining a disinfectant and/or bactericidal aqueous<br>
composition.<br>
Control Example 2<br>
Water was added to 2 ml of a 10 W/V% benzalkonium chloride<br>
aqueous solution (Nihon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) to give a total<br>
volume of 100 mL, thus obtaining a disinfectant and/or<br>
bactericidal aqueous composition.<br>
Control Example 3<br>
Water was added to 5 ml of a 20 W/V% chlorhexidine<br>
gluconate aqueous solution (Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals Company<br>
Limited) to give a total volume of 100 mL, thus obtaining a<br>
disinfectant and/or bactericidal aqueous composition.<br>
[Evaluation methods]<br><safety tests><br>
For each of the disinfectant and/or bactericidal aqueous<br>
compositions obtained in the Examples and Control Examples<br>
described above, a local skin safety test was carried out as<br>
follows in accordance with the Draize method using rabbits (male<br>
NZW) .<br>
The hair on the back of each of the rabbits was shorn off,<br>
and rabbits having little island skin and for which the hair<br>
cycle was in the dormant period were selected, and six rabbits<br>
were put into each group. The back of each rabbit was divided<br>
into four zones, and two zones with point symmetry relative to<br>
the center were taken as unwounded skin, and the other two zones<br>
were taken as wounded skin by forming 2.5 cm-long scratches in a<br>
double cross shape using an 18G injection needle on the day of<br>
application. A 2.5 cm-square lint cloth onto which 0.3 ml of the<br>
test liquid had been applied was stuck onto the site of<br>
application using rayon tape, and fixing was carried out by<br>
covering over with taping tape. 24 hours after the application,<br>
the lint cloth was removed.<br>
The site of application was examined, and an evaluation<br>
score was determined for erythema, incrustation and edema in<br>
accordance with the Draize judgement criteria. The primary<br>
irritation index (P.I.I) was calculated from the evaluation<br>
scores for the unwounded skin and the wounded skin 24 hours and<br>
72 hours after the application, thus evaluating the irritability.<br>
The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
(Table Removed) The results show that the compositions of Examples 1 to 5<br>
according to the present invention have approximately the same or<br>
lower skin irritation than the compositions of Control Example I,<br>
which are already widely used as disinfectants, and thus are<br>
highly safe.<br>
In addition, the compositions of Examples 1 to 5 also have<br>
the same or lower skin irritation than the composition of Control<br>
Examples 2 to 3.<br><antibacterial activity tests><br>
Each test strain was cultured overnight at 37°C using a<br>
Muller-Hinton broth, successive subculture was carried out three<br>
times, and then the resulting precultured bacterial solution was<br>
adjusted to an optical density (OD) at 660nm of 0.3 Abs using<br>
sterilized distilled water to make the count approximately 108<br>
cfu/mL, and then the solution was further diluted to 100 fold<br>
with sterilized distilled water to make the count approximately<br>
106 cfu/mL, thus obtaining a test bacterial suspension.<br>
Using the test suspension, a 2-fold dilution series was<br>
produced using sterilized distilled water such that for each<br>
suspension in the series the olanexidine concentration was 2<br>
times of the final test concentration, and 50 (oL of each<br>
suspension in the series was dispensed into the wells of eight<br>
rows in length of a 96-well microplate in order of lowest<br>
concentration upward. 50 uL of the test bacterial suspension was<br>
dispensed into each of the wells into which one of the suspension<br>
to be tested had been dispensed, and mixing was carried out<br>
immediately. 10 uL of each mixed reaction liquid was collected,<br>
and after a prescribed treatment time period was instilled into<br>
200 jiL of an SCDLP culture medium (deactivating medium for<br>
disinfectant) that had already been dispensed into the wells of<br>
another 96-well microplate and mixing was carried out to stop the<br>
bactericidal activity, and then culturing was carried out for 48<br>
hours at 37°C.<br>
After the culturing, it was judged with the naked eye from<br>
turbidity of the culture medium whether or not the bacteria had<br>
proliferated in each well, with the presence of turbidity being<br>
taken as indicating that the bacteria had proliferated, and the<br>
absence of turbidity being taken as indicating that the bacteria<br>
had not proliferated. Out of the dilution series for the test suspension, the minimum concentration for which proliferation of<br>
the bacteria was not observed was taken as the minimum<br>
bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the liquid to be tested for<br>
the test bacteria.<br>
The antibacterial activity test results are shown in Tables<br>
2 and 3.<br>
(Table Removed)As shown by the results in Tables 2 and 3, the<br>
compositions of Examples 1 to 5 according to the present<br>
invention show a broad antibacterial spectrum, and show<br>
stronger bactericidal effects than the conventional<br>
disinfectant. Moreover, as shown by the results in Table 2,<br>
these bactericidal effects are shown strongly even with a<br>
short bactericidal treatment time of 10 seconds, which is<br>
very advantageous in terms of practical use.<br>
The solubility of olanexidine hydrochloride alone is<br>
0.02% at 0°C, and, for example, at this concentration, the<br>
bactericidal activity is prone to being influenced by pH,<br>
serum, soap, temperature and so on. With the compositions of<br>
the present invention, the olanexidine hydrochloride<br>
concentration is increased, and hence such influence is<br>
eliminated.<br>
Test Example 1<br>
For the composition of Example 2 [concentration 0.1% (1000<br>
Hg/mL) in terms of olanexidine hydrochloride], and an aqueous<br>
solution of 0.02% (200 |ag/mL) olanexidine hydrochloride alone,<br>
a comparison of the bactericidal activity under conditions of<br>
contamination with organic matter (under the presence of 5%<br>
bovine serum) was carried out. Staphylococcus aureus FDA<br>
209P, Escherichia coli NIHJ JC-2 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa<br>
ATCC 10145 were used as test bacteria. The results are shown<br>
in (Table Removed)<br>
From these results, it was found that even under the presence<br>
of organic matter, the composition of Example 2 exhibits<br>
bactericidal activity in a shorter time than the aqueous<br>
solution of olanexidine hydrochloride alone, and hence is<br>
highly practically useful.<br>
Test Example 2<br>
The skin on the back of mice was contaminated with<br>
Staphylococcus aureus FDA 209P, and a comparison of the<br>
disinfectant effect was carried out for various treatment<br>
groups as shown in Table 5.<br>
(Table Removed)The results show that immediately after (10 s after)<br>
the disinfecting, the group treated with 70% ethanol and the<br>
group treated with the composition of Example 1 exhibited a<br>
eradication rate of 100%, and the group treated with the<br>
composition of Example 2 exhibited a sterilization rate of<br>
almost 100%. However, two hours after the disinfecting, the<br>
group treated with 70% ethanol exhibited a sterilization rate<br>
of 0.77%, which was close to that for the untreated group,<br>
i.e. a sterilization effect was no longer observed. In<br>
contrast with this, the groups treated with the compositions<br>
of Examples 1 and 2 each exhibited a sterilization rate of at<br>
least 99.9% two hours after the disinfecting, i.e. exhibited<br>
a high sterilization sustaining effect. This sterilization<br>
sustaining effect was still observed even four hours after<br>
the disinfecting.<br>

The aqueous solutions obtained in Examples III-l to<br>
III-6 were still transparent and colorless without<br>
precipitation even after being left at a temperature in the<br>
vicinity of 0°C.<br>
Comparative Example III-l<br>
Approximately 80 ml of water was added to 50 mg of<br>
olanexidine hydrochloride (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.)<br>
and dissolution was carried out, the pH was adjusted to 6,<br>
and then water was further added to give a total volume of<br>
100 mL, thus obtaining a disinfectant and/or bactericidal<br>
aqueous composition. (Solubility was 0.05 W/V% at 25°C.)<br>
Control Example III-l<br>
Approximately 80 ml of water was added to 2.5 ml of a<br>
20 W/V% chlorhexidine gluconate aqueous solution (Sumitomo<br>
Pharmaceuticals Company Limited), the pH was adjusted to 6,<br>
and then water was further added to give a total volume of<br>
100 mL, thus obtaining a disinfectant and/or bactericidal<br>
aqueous composition.<br>
Antibacterial activity tests<br>
Each test strain was cultured overnight at 37°C using a<br>
Muller-Hinton broth, successive subculture was carried out<br>
three times, and then the resulting precultured bacterial<br>
solution was adjusted to an optical density (OD) at 660nm of<br>
0.3 Abs using sterilized distilled water to make the count<br>
approximately 108 cfu/mL, and then the solution was further<br>
diluted to 100 fold with sterilized distilled water to make<br>
the count approximately 106 cfu/mL, thus obtaining a test<br>
bacterial solution.<br>
Using the test suspension, a 2-fold dilution series was<br>
produced using sterilized distilled water such that for each<br>
suspension in the series the olanexidine concentration was 2<br>
times of the final test concentration, and 50 iL of each<br>
liquid in the series was dispensed into the wells of eight<br>
rows in length of a 96-well microplate in order of lowest<br>
concentration upward. 50 L of the test bacterial solution<br>
was dispensed into each of the wells into which one of the<br>
test liquids had been dispensed, and mixing was carried out<br>
immediately. 10 (4,L of each mixed reaction suspension was<br>
collected, and after a prescribed treatment time period was<br>
instilled into 200 )^L of an SCDLP culture medium<br>
(deactivating medium for disinfectant) that had already been<br>
dispensed into the wells of another 96-well microplate and<br>
mixing was carried out to stop the bactericidal activity, and<br>
then culturing was carried out for 48 hours at 37°C.<br>
After the culturing, it was judged with the naked eye<br>
from turbidity of the culture medium whether or not the<br>
bacteria had proliferated in each well, with the presence of<br>
turbidity being taken as indicating that the bacteria had<br>
proliferated, and the absence of turbidity being taken as<br>
indicating that the bacteria had not proliferated. Out of<br>
the dilution series for the test suspension, the minimum<br>
concentration for which proliferation of the bacteria was not<br>
observed was taken as the minimum bactericidal concentration<br>
(MBC) of the test liquid for the test bacteria.<br>
The antibacterial activity test results are shown in Tables 6<br>
and 7.<br>
(Table Removed)As shown by the results in Tables 6 and 7, the liquids<br>
of Examples III-l to III-6 according to the present invention<br>
show a broad antibacterial spectrum than the liquid of<br>
Comparative Example III-l, and show stronger bactericidal<br>
effects than the conventional disinfectant (Control Example<br>
III-l). Moreover, these bactericidal effects are displayed<br>
strongly even with a relatively short bactericidal treatment<br>
time of 30 seconds, which is very advantageous in terms of<br>
practical use.<br>
The solubility in water of olanexidine hydrochloride<br>
alone is 0.02% at 0°C, and, for example, at this<br>
concentration, the bactericidal activity is prone to being<br>
influenced by pH, serum, soap, temperature and so on. With<br>
the compositions of the present invention, the olanexidine<br>
hydrochloride concentration is increased, and hence such<br>
influence is eliminated.<br><br><br>
