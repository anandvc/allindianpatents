HIGH MANNOSE PROTEINS AND METHODS OF MAKING HIGH MANNOSE<br>
PROTEINS<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder characterized by a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme, glucocerebrosidase (GCB). GCB hydrolyzes the glycolipid glucocerebroside that is formed after degradation of glycosphingolipids in the membranes of white blood cells and red blood cells. The deficiency in this enzyme causes glucocerebroside to accumulate in large quantities in the lysosomes of phagocytic cells located in the liver, spleen and bone marrow of Gaucher patients. Accumulation of these molecules causes a range of clinical manifestations including splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, skeletal disorder, thrombocytopeniaand anemia- (Beutler et al. Gaucher disease; In: The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease (McGraw-Hill, Inc, New York, 1995) pp.2625-2639)<br>
Treatments for patients suffering from this disease include administration of analgesics for relief of bone pain, blood and platelet transfusions and, in some cases, splenectomy. Joint replacement is sometimes necessary for patients who experience bone erosion.<br>
Enzyme replacement therapy with GCB has been used as a treatment for Gaucher disease. Current treatment of patients with Gaucher disease includes administration of a carbohydrate remodeled GCB derived from human placenta or Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with a GCB expression construct and known as alglucerase or imiglucerase, respectively. The treatment is extremely expensive in part because of the cost of removing sugars from GCB to expose the trimannosyl core of complex glycans in order to target the enzyme to mannose receptors on cells of reticuloendothelial origin. The scarcity of the human placental tissue (in the case of alglucerase), complex purification protocols, and the relatively large amounts of the carbohydrate remodeled GCB required all contribute to the cost of the treatment.<br><br>
WO 02/15927	PCTfUSGl/25882<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention is based, in part on the discovery that by preventing removal of one or -<br>
more masnose residues distal from the pentasaccharide core of a precursor oligosaccharide<br>
chain of a protein, e.g., a lysosomal storage en2yme, a high mannose protein such as high<br>
5	mannose glucocerebrosidase (hmGCB) can be obtained These high mannose proteins can<br>
be used to target the protein to cells "which express mannose receptors. Such cells can include cells of reticuloendothelial origin including macrophages, Kupffer cells and histiocytes. Thus, these high mannose proteins can be used, for example, to target delivery by receptor mediated endocytosis to lysosomes to treat various lysosomal storage diseases.<br>
10	In particular, hmGCB has been found to efficiently target mannose receptors.<br>
Mannose receptors are present on macrophages and other cells, e.g.* dendritic cells, cardiomyocytes and glial cells, and are instrumental in receptor-mediated endocytosis. The absence of GCB in patients with Gaucher disease leads to accumulation of glucocerebroside, primarily in cells of reticuloendothelial origin including macrophages, Kupffer cells and<br>
15	histiocytes. Because these cells express mannose receptors on their surface, hmGCB can be<br>
used to effectively target delivery of a corrective enzyme to the lysosomes through receptor-mediated endocytosis, thereby treating Gaucher disease. Surprisingly, it was found that hmGCB uptake by macrophages was increased as compared to uptake of GCB secreted from cells.<br>
20	Accordingly, in one aspect, the invention features a method of producing a<br>
preparation of high mannose glucocerebrosidase (hmGCB). The method includes:<br>
providing a cell which is capable of expressing GCB; and<br>
allowing production of GCB having a precursor oligosaccharide under conditions<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The invention is based, in part, on the discovery that inhibition of the removal of one or more mannose residues distal from the pentasaccharide core of a precursor oligosaccharide chain of glucocerebrosidase (GCB), results in high mannose glucocerebrosidase (hmGCB) that is efficiently targeted to mannose receptors. The removal of a mannose residue from the pentasaccharide core of a precursor oligosaccharide chain can be prevented by inhibiting or reducing the activity of one or more mannosidase enzymes, e.g., one or more class 1 processing maimosidase(s) and/or class 2 processing mannosidase(s).

Gaucher disease is caused by a deficiency of GCB. GCB is required for degradation of glycosphingoiipid giucocerebroside. In the absence of GCB, the giucocerebroside 5        accumulates primarily in phagocytic cells, e.g., macrophages, and, ultimately, builds up in the liver, spleen and bone marrow.<br>
Macrophages have mannose receptors. These receptors play a role in receptor-mediated endocytosis by these cells. hrnGCB efficiently targets the mairaose receptors on . macrophages and improves the uptake of GCB (in the form of hmGCB) into these cells. By 10        directing GCB (in the form of hmGCB) to the cells in which giucocerebroside accumulates, hmGCB can be used to hydiolyze giucocerebroside in the macrophages, thereby reducing the subsequent accumulation of this glycolipid in the liver, spleen and bone marrow of patients having Gaucher disease.<br>

from various species. (See Horowitz et al. (1989) Genomics 4(l):87-96; Beutler et ai. (1992) Genomics 12(4):795-800),<br>
Mature human GCB has five potential N-lmked glycosylation sites at Asn-I9, Asn-59, Asn-146, Asu-270, and Asn-462. Glycosylation occurs at four of the five sites in human<br>
20        tissue derived GCB (Erickson et al. (1985) /. Biol Chem. 260:14319-14324). Studies<br>
employing site-directed mutagenesis have demonstrated that the site at Asn-462 is never occupied (Berg-Fussman et al. (1993) I Biol. Chem. 268:14861-14866). Approximately 20% ofths released glycan chains from human placental GCB were shown to be of the high mannose type containing up to seven mannose residues, whereas the majority of the glycan<br>
25        chains were of the complex type with sialylated biantennary and triantennary structures. (Takasaki etal. (1984)/. Biol Chem. 259:10112-10117)<br>
The first event in GCB N-glycosylate on is the co-translational transfer in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 from oligosaccharide-PP-dolichol to nascent peptide. The presence of the three glucose residues on the donor oligosaccharide<br>

FollowingN-slyco5vistE3Zi. ^ gnz^ese residues are rapitfly removed from GCB during the folding process by BR gri^xjsidsses I and H Two different ER manncsidases are each capable of hydrolyzing a single mannase residue from Maxi9GIcNAc2 to form two different isomers of MangGlcNAci (see Fig. 1). Accessible glycaris are then further processed in the 5        Golgi to Man5GlcNAc2 by the removal of up to four al ,2-linked mannose residues by Golgi mannosidase I. There are af least three different human genes encoding related Golgi mannosidase I isoforms (IA, IB, and IC) with shghtly different substrate specificities and tissue expression but all are capable of trimming four maP&amp;ose residues from Man$GlcNAc2 glycans to form Man5GIcNAc2 (Tremblay et al. (July 27, 2000) /. Biol Chem. [epub ahead of 10        print]). They are located on chromosomes 6q22, lp!3, afld lp35-36 and their cDNA sequences are obtainable from GenBank as X74837, AF027156, and AF261655, respectively.<br>
The final stage of processing that commits a glycan to the biosynthetic pathway for complex glycans requires the initial conversion of Man5Gric'jSiAc2 to GlcNAcMansGiclSiAc2 15        by the action of GlcNAc transferase I, after which Golgi inannosidase U can catalyse the removal of two further mannose residues to yield GIcNA^Man3GlcNAc2. This is the substrate for glycan elongation by glycosyl transferases located in the trans Golgi and the trans Golgi network to form complex type chains.<br>
If the high mannose chains transferred to GCB in the initial N-glycosylati on step can 20        be prevented from being processed to complex chains in tbe Golgi, then GCB with high mannose chains (hmGCB) will effectively target the mannose receptors on reticuloendothelial cells.<br>
Cells<br>
25	Primary and secondary cells to be transfected or infected can be obtained from a<br>
variety of tissues and include cell types which can be maintained and propagated in culture. For example, primary and secondary cells which can be transfected or infected include fibroblasts, keratinccytes, epithelial cells (e.g., mammary epithelial cells, intestinal epithelial cells), endothelial cells, glial cells, neural cells, formed elements of the blood (e.g.,<br>
30        lymphocytes, bone marrow cells), muscle cells and precursors of these somatic cell types.<br>
Primary cells are preferably obtained from the individual to whom the transfected or infected<br><br>

primary or secondary cells 'are admisster  (Le~ £2 autologous cell). However.primary cells may be obtained from £ donor (other nzsn the recipient) of the same species (i.e.. an allogeneic cell) or another species (ie.; a xenogeneic cell) (e.g., mouse, rat, rabbit, cat, dog, pig, cow, bird, sheep, goat, horse: monkey, baboon).<br>
Primary or secondary ceils of vertebrate, particularly mammalian, origin can be transfected or infected with an exogenous DNA sequence, e.g., an exogenous DNA sequence encoding a therapeutic protein, and produce an encoded therapeutic protein stably and reproducibly, both in vitro and in vivo, over extended periods of time. In addition, the transfected or infected primary and secondary cells can express the encoded product in vivo at physiologically relevant levels, cells can be recovered after implantation and, upon reculturing, to grow and display their preimplantaiion properties. Cells can be modified to reduce cell surface histo compatibility, complex or foreign carbohydrate moieties to reduce immunogenecity, e.g., a universal donor cell.<br>
Alternatively, primary or secondary cells of vertebrate, particularly mammalian, origin can be transfected or infected with an exogenous DNA sequence which includes a regulatory sequence. Examples of such regulatory sequences include one or more of: a promoter, an enhancer, an UAS, a scaffold attachment region or a transcription binding site. The targeting event can result in the insertion of the regulatory sequence of the DNA sequence, placing a targeted endogenous gene under their control (for example, by insertion of either a promoter or an enhancer, or both, upstream of the endogenous gene or regulatory region). Optionally, the targeting event can simultaneously result in the deletion of an endogenous regulatory sequence, such as the deletion of a tissue-specific negative regulatory sequence, of a gene. The targeting event can replace an existing regulatory sequence; for example, a tissue-specific enhancer can be replaced by an enhancer that has broader or different cell-type specificity than the endogenous elements, or displays a pattern of regulation or induction that is different from the corresponding nontransfected or nonmfected cell. In this regard, the endogenous sequences are deleted and new sequences are added. Alternatively, the endogenous regulatory sequences are not removed or replaced but are disrupted or disabled by the targeting event, such as by targeting the exogenous sequences within the endogenous regulatory elements. Introduction of a regulatory sequence by homologous recombination can result in primary or secondary cells expressing a therapeutic<br><br>

Transfected primary or secondary cells, can be made by electroporation. Electrop oration is carried out at appropriate voltage and capacitance (and corresponding time constant) to result in entry of the DNA construct(s) into the primary or secondary cells. 20        Electroporation can be carried out over a wide range of voltages (e.g., 50 to 2000 volts) and corresponding capacitance. Total DNA of approximately 0.1 to 500 u.g is generally used.<br>

Processing of Glucocerebrosidase<br>
Oligosaccharide assembly in cells which have not been treated to prevent removal of mannose residues usually proceeds as discussed below:<br>
The oligosaccharide chains of GCB are attached to the polypeptide backbone by N-30        glycosidic linkages. N-linked glycans have an amide bond that connects the anomeric carbon<br><br>

Initiation of N-linked oligosaccharide assembly does not occur directry on me Asn residues of the GCB protein, but rather involves preass&amp;nhly of a lipid-linlceG 14 sugar 5        precursor oligosaccharide which is then transferred to the protein in the ER during or very soon after its translation from mRNA. A "precursor ohgosacchande" as used herein refers to the oligosaccharide chain involved in the initial steps in biosynthesis of carbohydrate chains. A "precursor oligosaccharide" can be an oligosaccharide structure which includes at least the following sugars: Man9GlcNAc2, for example, a precursor oligosaccharide can have the 1 o        following structure: Glc3MangGlcNAc2, as shown in Figure 1. The precursor ohgosacchande is synthesized while attached via a pyrophosphate bridge to a polyisoprenoid carrier lipid, a dolichoh This assembly involves at least six distinct membrane-bound giyc^syirransfexases. Some of these enzymes transfer monosaccharides from nucleotide sugars, while others utilize dolichol-iinked monosaccharides as sugar donors. After assembly of the hpid-hnked 15        precursor is complete, another membrane-bound enzyme transfers it to sterically accessible Asn residues which occur as part of the sequence -Asn-X-Ser/Thr-.<br>
Glycosylated Asn residues of newly-synthesized GCB transiently carry<br>
,	Glc3Man9GIcNAc2, also referred to herein as an "unprocessed carbohydrate chain".<br>
The processmg of N-linked oligosaccharides is accomplished by the sequential action<br>
20	of a number of membrane-bound enzymes and begins immediately after transfer of the<br>
precursor oligosaccharide Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 to the protein. The terms "processing", "trimming" and "modifying" are used interchangeably herein.<br>
N-linked oligosaccharide processing can be divided into three stages: removal of the three glucose residues, removal of a variable number of marrnose residues, and addition of 25        various sugar residues to the resulting trimmed core.<br>
The removal of the glucose residues in the first stage of processing involves removal<br>
of all three glucose residues to generate N-linked Man9GlcNAc2. This structure is also<br>
referred to herein as: Manal-2Manal-2Manal-3[Manal-2Manal-3(Manal-2Manal-<br>

Four of the mannose residues of the Man5GIcNA(&gt;= moiety are bound by a 1.2 linkages. Up to four of these a 1:2-Iinked mannose residues can be removed by mariDcsidss^ LA IB and IC to generate N-linked Man5.gGlcNAc2.<br>
Protein-linked Man5G3cNAc2 can then serve as a substrate for GlcNAc transferase I, 5        which transfers a p 1 J2-linked GlcNAc residue from UDP-GlcNAc to the core a 1,3-linked mannose residue to form GlcNAcMan5GlcNAc2- Mannosidase H can then complete the triinming phase of the processing pathway by removing two mannose residues to generate a protein-linked oligosaccharide which contains within it a Man3GlcNAc2, the "pentasaccharide core". The structure GIcNAcMan3G]cNAc2 is then a substrate for GlcNAc 10        transferase II, which can transfer a p ls2-linked GlcNAc residue to the a 1,6-linked mannose residue.<br>
After the trimming phase, monosaccharides are sequentially added to the growing oligosaccharide chain by a series of membrane-bound Golgi glycosyltransferases, each of which is highly specific with respect to the acceptor oligosaccharide, the donor sugar, and the 15        type of linkage formed between the sugars. These can include distinct GlcNAc transferases (producing p 1,2; p 1, 4; or p 1,6 linkages); galactosyltransferases (producing p 1, 4; p 1,3; and a 1,3 linkages); sialyltransferases (one producing a 2, 3 and another, a 2, 6 linkages); fiicosyltransferases (producing a 1,2; a 1,3; a 1, 4 or a 1,6 linkages); and a growing list of other enzymes responsible for a variety of unusual linkages. The cooperative action of these 20        glycosyltransferases produces a diverse family of structures collectively referred to as "complex" oligosaccharides. These may contain two, three or four outer branches ("antennae") attached to the invariant core pentasaccharide, Mar^GlcNAc^. These structures are referred to in terms of the number of their outer branches: biantennary (two branches), triantennary (three branches) or tetraantennary (four branches). The size of these complex 25        glycans can vary.<br>
Processing of High Mannose Glucocerebrosidase<br>
hmGCB can be produced by reducing or preventing cellular carbohydrate modification (i.e., processing) of GCB. Carbohydrate modification can be prevented by 30        allowing production of GCB under conditions which prevent the removal of at least one<br>
mannose residue distal to the pentasaccharide core of a precursor oligosaccharide chain of<br><br>
WO 02/15927	PCT/US01/25882<br>
GCB. Per example, one or more of the 'trimming" stages durmg me removal of mannose residues from a precursor oligosaccharide can be prevented.<br>
Cellular mannosidases fall into two broad classes: class 1 processing enzymes, which<br>
include ER mannosidase I. Golgi mannosidase IA, IB and IC and which hydrolyze a.1,2-<br>
5	linked marmose residues, and require Ca2+ for activity; and class 2 processing enzymes,<br>
which include ER mannosidase II, Golgi mannosidase II, cytosolic a-mannosidase, and lysosomal a-mannosidase and which have a broader substrate specificity and do not require Ca2+ for activity.<br>
The trimming of mannose residues from the precursor oligosaccharide involves at 10        least the following mannosidase enzymes: Golgi mannosidase IA, IB and IC, and Golgi mannosidase II. By inhibiting one or more of these mannosidases during N-linked oligosaccharide assembly in a cell, GCB can he produced which has at least one carbohydrate chain with one or more mannose residues in addition to the pentasaccharide core. For example, inhibition of both ER mannosidase I and Golgi mannosidase I can 15        produce hmGCB with at least one carbohydrate chain (and preferably all chains) having at least eight mannose residues from the precursor oligosaccharide; inhibition of Golgi mannosidase II can produce hmGCB with at least one carbohydrate chain (and preferably all chains) having at least five mannose residues from the precursor oligosaccharide.<br>
Trirnming by a mannosidase can be inhibited, for example, by contacting the cell with 20        a substance which prevents the removal of one or more mannose residues from a precursor oligosaccharide of GCB or by producing GCB in a cell which does not produce or produces at deficient levels at least one mannosidase, or in a cell which produces a mutated and/or inactive mannosidase. For example, the cell can be a knockout for at least one mannosidase, can express at least one antisense mannosidase molecule or can be dominant negative for at 25        least one mannosidase.<br>
Substances Which Prevent Removal of Mannose Residues<br>
A substance which prevents the removal of one or more mannose residues from a<br>
precursor oligosaccharide of GCB can be used to produce an hmGCB preparation. For<br>
30	example, a cell which expresses GCB can be contacted with a substance which prevents the<br>
removal of one or more a 1,2 mannose residues of a precursor oligosaccharide of GCB,<br><br>
WO 02/15927	PCT/US01/25882<br>
and/or removal of an alp mannose residue of a precursor oligosaccharide of GCB, and/or removal of ana 1.6 mannose residue of a precursor oligosaccharide of GCB. Preferably; the substance is a mannosidase inhibitor, e.g., a class 1 processing mannosidase inhibitor or a class 2 processing mannosidase inhibitor.<br>
Cellular mannosidases fall into two broad classes on the basis of protein sequence homologies (Moremen et al. (1994) Glycobiology 4:113-125). These two classes are mechanistically different Class 1 enzymes, which include ER mannosidase I and Golgi mannosidase I isoforms, have a mass of about 63-73 kDa, hydrolyze al,2-Unked mannose residues and require Ca2+for activity. Class 1 processing mannosidases can be blocked, for example, by treatment with a substrate mimic, e^g., a pyranose analog of mannose'. For example, class 1 processing mannosidases can be blocked by treatment with one or more of the following enzymatic inhibitors: kifunensine, deoxymannojirimycin, or a combination thereof. Class 2 enzymes, which include ER mannosidase I, Golgi mannosidase H, cystolic a-mannosidase, and lysosomal a-mannosidase, have a greater mass of about 107-136 kDa, do not require Ca2+ for activity and have a broader substrate specificity. Class 2 processing mannosidases can be blocked, for example, by treatment with furanose transition state analogues of the mannosyl cation (Daniels et al. (1994) GlycoBiol. 4:551-566). For example, class 2 processing mannosidases can by blocked by treatment with one or more of the following inhibitors:, swainsonine, 6-deoxy-DIM, 6-deoxy-6-fluoro-DIMJ mannostatin A, or combinations thereof.<br>
Kifunensine can be used as an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum mannosidase I and/or Golgi mannosidase IA and/or IB and/or 1C; deoxymannojirimycin can be used as an inhibitor of ER maimosidase I, ER mannosidase EE and/or of Golgi mannosidase IA and/or IB and/or 1C; swainsonine can be used an inhibitor of Golgi mannosidase H; and mannostatin A can be used as an inhibitor of Golgi mannosidase U.<br>
Use of a mannosidase inhibitor can inhibit the processing of a carbohydrate chain of GCB past a certain stage of mannose residue trimming during oligosaccharide assembly. For example, contacting a cell with kifunensine can inhibit triinrning of any, or one, two, three, or four of the mannose residues of a precursor oligosaccharide.<br>
Processing a-mannosidases can be blocked by treatment of cells with one or more of the following enzyme inhibitors:<br><br>

Various mannosidase inhibitors can be selected by their ability to penetrate particular cell types as well as by the inhibitory potency of the mannosidase inhibitor.  Fox example, swainsonine is rapidly internalized by cultured fibroblasts in a time- and concentratzon-<br>
20	dependent manner. Swainsonine is also a potent inhibitor of a class 2 mannosidase, e.g.,<br>
Golgi mannosidase U. Thus, swainsonine can be used to produce hmGCB in cultured fibroblasts, e.g., hmGCB having at least one carbohydrate chain which has at least four or five mannose residues of the precursor oligosaccharide. In addition, Hfunensine is readily taken up by cultured fibroblasts and is a potent inhibitor of class 1 mannosidases, e.g., ER<br>
25	mannosidase I and Golgi mannosidase I. Thus, kifunensine can be used to produce hmGCB<br>
in cultured fibroblasts, e.g., hmGCB having at least one carbohydrate chain which has at least four, five, six, seven, eight or nine mannose residues of the precursor oligosaccharide.<br>
Preferably, the mannosidase inhibitor is present at a concentration of 0.025 to 20.0 ug/ml, 0.05 to 10 ug/ml, 0.05 to 5 tig/ml, preferably between about 0.1 to 2.0 jig/ml. For<br>

Mannosidase Mutant Cell<br>
Mannosidase Knockout Cell<br>
10	Permanent or regulated inactivation of mannosidase gene expression can be achieved<br>
by targeting to a mannosidase locus with a transfected plasmid DNA construct or a synthetic oligonucleotide. The plasmid construct or oligonucleotide can be designed to several forms. These include the following: 1) insertion of selectable marker genes or other sequences within an exon of a mannosidase gene; 2) insertion of exogenous sequences in regulatory 15        regions of non-coding sequence; 3) deletion or replacement of regulatory and/or coding sequences; and, 4) alteration of a protein coding sequence by site specific mutagenesis.<br>
In the case of insertion of a selectable marker gene into coding sequence, it is possible to create an in-frame fusion of an endogenous mannosidase exon with the mannosidase exon engineered to contain, for example, a selectable marker gene. In this way following 2fl        successful targeting, the endogenous mannosidase gene expresses a fusion mRNA<br>
(mannosidase sequence "plus selectable marker sequence). Moreover, the fusion mRNA would be unable to produce a functional mannosidase translation product.<br>
In the case of insertion of DNA sequences into regulatory regions, the transcription of<br>
a mannosidase gene can be silenced by disrupting the endogenous promoter region or any<br>
25	other regions in the 5' untranslated region (5* UTR) that is needed for transcription. Such<br>
regions include, for example, translational control regions and splice donors of introns. Secondly, a new regulatory sequence can be inserted upstream of the mannosidase gene that would render the mannosidase gene subject to the control of extracellular factors. It would thus be possible to down-regulate or extinguish mannosidase gene expression as desired for 30        optimal hmGCB production. Moreover, a sequence which includes a selectable marker and a promoter can be used to disrupt expression of the endogenous sequence. Finally, all or part<br><br>
WO OZ'15927	PCT/USOl/25882<br>
c-ftht endogenous mannosidase gene could be. deleted by appropriate design of targeting<br>
In order to create a cell which includes a knockout of at least one chromosomal copy of the human Golgi mannosidase IA, IB or IC gene, the genomic DNA comprising at least the 5' portion of the gene (including regulatory sequences, 5' UTR, coding sequence) is isolated. For example, the GenBank sequence, Accession No.: NM0059Q7 (human), can be used to generate a probe for Golgi mannosidase IA or Accession Nos.: AAF97058 can be used to generate a probe for Golgi mannosidase IB or IC using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Oligonucleotides for PCR can be designated based upon the GenBank sequence. The resulting probe can hybridize to the single copy Golgi mannosidase IA, IB or IC gene. This probe can then be used to screen a commercially available recombinant phage library (e.g., a library made from human genomic DNA) to isolate a clone comprising all or part of the mannosidase I structural genes. Once a recombinant clone comprising a mannosidase regulatory and/or coding sequence is isolated, specific targeting plasmids designed to achieve the inactivation of mannosidase gene expression can then be constructed. Inactivation of mannosidase activity results from the insertion of exogenous DNA into regulatory or coding sequences to disrupt the translational reading frame. Inactivation of the enzyme can also be the result of disruption of mRNA transcription or rnRNA processing, or by deletion of endogenous mannosidase regulatory or coding sequences.<br>
The nucleic acid sequence of other class 1 and class 2 processing mannosidase are also available, for example, in GenBank. Using the methods described above for Golgi mannosidase IA, IB or IC, a knockout cell for other class 1 and/or class 2 processing -mannosidases can be produced.<br>
A mannosidase knockout cell can be used, for example, in gene therapy. A knockout cell can be administered to a subject, e.g., a subject having Gaucher disease, such that the cell produces hmGCB in vivo.<br>
Antisense Mannosidase Nucleic Acid Sequences<br>
Nucleic acid molecules which are antisense to a nucleotide encoding a mannosidase, e.g., a class 1 processing or class 2 processing mannosidase, can be used as an inactivating<br><br>
WO 02/15527	PCT/US01/25882"<br>
sgcr^ uracil inhibit expression of a mannosidase. For example, Golgi mannosidase 1A_ Gebd maniiosiGESs IB. Golgi mannosidase IC. and/or Golgi mannosidase II explosion can be isinbiteG by an sniisense nucleic acid molecule. An "antisense" nucleic acid i^.Jndes a nucleotide sequence which is complementary to a "sense" nucleic acid encoding a mannosidase, e.g., complementary to the coding strand of a double-stranded cDNA molecule or complementary to an mRNA sequence. Accordingly, an antisense nucleic acid can form hydrogen bonds with a sense nucleic acid. The antisense nucleic acid can be complementary to an entire mannosidase coding strand, or to only a portion thereof. For example, an . antisense nucleic acid molecule which antisense to the "coding region" of the coding strand of a nucleotide sequence encoding a mannosidase can be used. .<br>
As the coding strand sequences encoding various mannosidases are disclosed in, for . example, Bause (1993) Eur. J. Biochem. 217(2):535-540; Gonzalez et al. (1999) J. Biol Chem. 274(30):21375-21386; Misago et al. (1995) Proc. Nail Acad. Set USA 92(25):11766-11770; Tremblay et al. (1998) Glycobiology 8(6):585-595, Tremblay et al. (2000) J. Biol Chem. Jul 27:[epub ahead of print], antisense nucleic acids can be designed according to the rules of Watson and Crick base pairing. The antisense nucleic acid molecule can comprise sequence complementary to the entire coding region of a mannosidase mRNA, but more preferably is an oligonucleotide which is complementary to only a portion of the coding or noncoding region of a mannosidase mRNA For example, the antisense oligonucleotide can comprise sequence complementary to the region surrounding the translation start site of a mannosidase mRNA. An antisense oligonucleotide can be, for example, about 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35,40, 45, 50, or more nucleotides in length. An antisense nucleic acid can be constructed using chemical synthesis and enzymatic ligation reactions using procedures known in the art. For example, an antisense nucleic acid (e.g., an antisense oligonucleotide) can be chemically synthesized using naturally occurring nucleotides or variously modified nucleotides designed to increase the biological stability of the molecules or to increase the physical stability of the duplex formed between the antisense and sense nucleic acids, e.g., phosphorothioate derivatives and acridine substituted nucleotides can be used. Examples of modified nucleotides which can be used to generate the antisense nucleic acid include 5-fluorouracii, 5-bromouraciI, 5-chlorouracil, 5-iodouracii, hypoxanthine, xanthine, 4-acetylcvtosine, 5-(carboxyhydroxylmethyl)uraciI, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl-2-<br><br>

Purification of hrnGCB<br>
The term "purified" hmGCB, as used herein, refers to hmGCB that is substantially free of cellular material when produced by a cell which expresses GCB. The language "substantially free of cellular material" includes preparations of hmGCB in which the protein , is separated from cellular components of the cells in which it is produced. In one embodiment, the language "substantially free of cellular material" includes preparations of hmGCB having less than about 30% (by dry weight) of non-GCB protein (also referred to herein as a "protein impurity" or "contaminating protein17), more preferably less than about 20% of non-GCB protein, still more preferably less than about 10% of non-GCB protein, and most preferably less than about 5% non-GCB protein. When the hmGCB is obtained (i.e., harvested) from culture media, it is also preferably substantially free of a component of the culture medium, i.e., components of the culture medium represent less than about 20%, more preferably less than about 10%, and most preferably less than about 5% of the dry weight of the protein preparation.<br>
Various methods can be used to harvest hmGCB from culture media. The term "harvested hmGCB" as used herein refers to hmGCB obtained from culture media or from a cell. For example, one of the following alternatives can be used'to prepare the harvested hmGCB prior to a purification procedure. These can include: 1) filtering the fresh harvest; 2) filtering the fresh harvest and freezing, e.g., at about-20°C to ~-80°C, the filtered product<br><br>
WO 02/13927	PCT/US01/25882<br>
. until ready for processing (at which tins t sn be xh^red end. optionally, filtered); 3) filtering the fresh harvest concentrHtnrg- nhssd prc-ds^i (e.g., by about 8 to 10 "fold), and then, optionally, filtering again; 4) filtering the fresh harvest, concentrating filtered product (e.g., by about 8 to 10 fold), optionally, filtering again, and then freezing, e.g., at about -20°C to -80°C, until ready for processing (at which time it can be thawed and, optionally, filtered). Variations of these alternatives can also be performed. For example, when the harvested product or concentrated harvested product is frozen, different harvests can be pooled after thawing and filtered. In addition, for harvested or concentrated harvested product, the product can be held at a cooling temperature, e.g., about 2°C to 8°C, for short periods of time, e.g., about 1 to 3 days, preferably 1 day, prior to purification. The harvested product held at the cooling temperature can be pooled prior to purification.<br>
When a concentration of harvest is performed, an ultrafiltration membrane with a 5,000 to 50,000 mw cutoff; preferably a 10,000 to 30,000 mw cutoff, can be employed. Filter clarification will typically employ a 1.2 um/0.5 urn prefilter, followed by a 0.2 urn final filter.<br>
HmGCB can be purified by the following purification techniques. For example, hydrophobic charge induction chromatography (HCIC) can be used to purify the hmGCB preparation. Alternatively, hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) can be used to purify the hmGCB preparation. Both HCIC and HIC are described below.<br>
HCIC or HIC can be used alone or in combination with one or more ion exchange steps. Ion exchange steps that can be used in combination with an HCIC or HIC step (either before.or after KCIC or HIC) include the use of anion exchange and/or cation exchange chromatography. Generally known commercially available anion exchange supports used in the purification of proteins bear quaternary ammonium functional groups. Preferred matrices for use in the present process are agarose or cellulose based matrices such as microcrystalline cellulose or cross-linked agaroses. Also particularly preferred are those matrices bearing diethyl aminoethyl, triethyl aminomethyl, or trimethyi aminomethyl functional groups. A particularly preferred anion exchange matrix is trimethyi aminomethyl crosslinked agarose, which is commercially available, e.g., Q-Sepharose Fast Flow® (Pharmacia). Generally known commercially available cation exchange supports that may be used in the purification of proteins bear acidic functionalities, including carboxy and sulfonic acids. Matrices<br><br>
WO 02/15927<br><br>
PCT/USO1/258 82<br><br>
- containing the cation functionalities include various fonzs of ceHnksss snd polystyrene based matrices. For example, weak cation exchangers krmrz. inisan xrjc^Kie. but are not limited to, Carboxym ethyl-Sepharose® and Carboxymethyl-CeMose®. Strong canon exchangers known in the art include, but are not limited to. sulfonated polystyrenes (AG 5.0W®, Bio-Rex 70®), sulfonated celluloses (SP~Sephadex®), and sulfonated Sepharoses (S-Sepharose®). A particularly preferred cation exchange matrix is S-Sephaiose Fast Flow® (Pharmacia).<br>
The chromatographic step involving these matrices is most preferably conducted as a column chromatography step or in alternative a batch absorptive technique, which optionally can be performed at a temperature between 25°C to 40°C. Preferably, a salt is added to a washing or eluting buffer to increase the ionic strength of the buffer. Any of the salts conventionally used may be employed for this purpose as can be readily determined by one skilled in the art, with NaCl being one of the most frequently and conveniently used salts.<br>
A conventional gel filtration step can also be used in combination with the HCIC or HIC chromatography process step. Representative examples of these matrices are polydexrrans cross Jinked with acrylamides, such as composite hydrophilic gels prepared by covalently cross linking allyl dextran with N, N'-methylene bisacrylamide and crosslinked cellulose or agarose gels. Commercially available crosslinked dextran-acrylamides are known under the trade name Sephacryl® and are available from Pharmacia. Commercially available crosslinked dextran-agarose resins are known under the trade name Superdex®, available from Pharmacia. A preferred Superdex® gel is Superdex 200®. Examples of crosslinked cellulose gels are those commercially available cross linking porous cellulose gels, e.g., GLC 300® or GLC 1,000® that are available from Amicon Inc. Silica based resins such as TSK-Gel SW®, available from TosoHaas can be utilized. Polymer based resins such as TSK-Gel PW®, TSK Alpha Series®, Toyopearl HW packings® (copolymerization of ethylene glycol and methyl acrylate polymers) are also available from TosoHaas.<br>
Preferably, HCIC or HIC can be combined with one or more of these ion exchange steps.  When a combination of HCIC or HIC and various ion exchange or ge] filtration steps are used, they can be performed in any order. For example, as described below a four step procedure can be followed which includes HCIC using MEP Hypercel® chromatography or<br><br>
WO 02/15927	VCT.VSQV25881<br>
HIC using MacroPrep Methyl® chromatography,- then Q Sepharose Fast Flow 5? Sepharose Fast Flow1© and lastly Superdex 200®. Several of these procedure are set form in more detail below.<br>
5	MEP Hypercel Chromatography<br>
MEP (mercaptoethylpyridine) Hypercel®.(BioSepra, Life Technologies) can be used for HCIC. It is a resin consisting of NEP linked to a regenerated cellulose bead of high porosity (80-100 microns). The functional group (MEP), consisting of a hydrophobic tail and an ionizable head group, is uncharged at neutral pH and can bind certain protein ligands 10        based on hydrophobic interaction at a physiological ionic strength: Elution is accomplished by decreasing pH to 4 to 5, at which MEP is positively charged, and the protein elates from the column due to electrostatic repulsion. For example, prepared harvest or harvest concentrate can be applied directly to the MEP column equilibrated with 25 mM so, :um phosphate, pH 6.8, containing 180 mM sodium chloride and 2 mM DTT. Optionally, the 15        column can then be washed with equilibration buffer containing 25 mM sodium caprylate until the absorbance at 280 nm (A280) stabilizes. The hmGCB can.be eluted from the column with 50mM sodium acetate, 2 mM DTT, pH 4.7, and the peak as monitored at 280 nm can be collected.<br>
20	MacroPrep Methyl Chromatography<br>
An alternative to MEP Hypercel® is MacroPrep Methyl®, which is a hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) resin. This resin consists of a methyl functional group attached to a bead composition of macroporous co-polymerized glycol methacryiaie and diethylene glycol dirnethacrylate. For example, MacroPrep Methyl® (BioRad)<br>
25        chromatography can be performed as follows. The pH of the harvest or harvest concentrate is adjusted to 5.6, and ammonium sulfate is added to 0.70 M final concentration. The prepared harvest can be applied to the MacroPrep Methyl® column, which has been equilibrated in 0.70 M ammonium sulfate, 10 mM MES, pH 5.6. After application of the load, the column is washed with equilibrated buffer until the A280 returns to baseline. The<br>
30        hmGCB can be eluted with 10 mM MES, pH 5.6. The eluted hmGCB can be ultrafiltered<br><br>
WO 02/15927	PCT/US01/25882<br>
and/or dianltered in preparation for steps such as an ion exchange step such as Q Senirsi^se chromatography, gp Sepharose chromatography and/or Superdex 200 Crtromatograprry.<br>
QjjgBfairose Chromatography<br>
Q Sepharose Fast Flow® (Amersham 'Pharmacia) is a relati vely strong anion exchange chromatography resin. The functional substituted is a quaternary amine group, which is positively charged over the working pH range of 2 to 12. Proteins with a net negative charge at the working pH will tend to bind to the resin at a relatively low ionic strength and can he eluted at higher ionic strength or lower pH. HmGCB does not bind to Q Sepharose at approximately pH 6 and low ionic strength, but impurities do bind, thereby purifying the sample. For example, the following protocol can be used to purify hmGCB in the sample by Q Sepharose Fast Flow® chromatography. Under appropriate conditions. hmGCB flows through this column, so the product is found in the flowthrough/wash fraction, Sodium phosphate (250 mM, pH 6) is added to the MEP elution pool prepared as described above to a final concentration of 25 mM, and the pH of the pool is adjusted to pH 6 with NaOH (and HC1 if necessary). The conductivity is adjusted to 2.5 +0.1 mS/cm by dilution with water or by ultrafiltration/diafiltration using 25 mM sodium phosphate, 2 mM DTT, at approximately pH 6. The material is then filtered and applied to a column of Q Sepharose Fast Flow® which has been equilibrated in 25 mM sodium phosphate, 2 mM DTT, pH 6.0. After application of the load, the column is washed with equilibration buffer until the A280 reaches baseline. The flowthrough/wash fraction can then be processed through another column., e.g.j SP Sepharose Fast Flow® column, shortly thereafter, e.g.^ within 24 hours, or frozen and stored at about -20°C to -S0°C prior to further processing.<br>
Other strong anion exchange resins, such as Macro-Prep High Q Support® (BioRad) can be used in place of Q Sepharose. A weaker anion exchange resin such as DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow® (Pharmacia) or Macro-Prep DEAE® (BioRad) can also be used. The column is equilibrated in buffer, e.g., 25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6. The pH of the sample is adjusted to pH 6 and the conductivity is adjusted by dilution or diafiltration to a relatively low ionic strength, which allows impurities to bind to the column and hmGCB to flow through. The sample is applied and the column is washed with equilibration buffer. Impurities are still bound to the column, and can be eluted with application of salt, e.g.,<br><br>
WO 02/15927	PCT7US01/25882<br>
sodium chloride or potassium chloride, or application of a lower pH buffer, or a combination of increased salt and lower pH;<br>
The hmGCB can also be allowed to bind the anion exchange column during loading by decreasing the salt concentration in the load or by running the column at a higher pH, or 5        by a combination of both decreased salt and higher pH.<br>
SP Sepharose Chromatography<br>
SP Sepharose Fast Flow® (Amersham Pharmacia) is a relatively strong cation exchange chromatography resin. The functional substltutent is a charged sulfonic acid group, 10        which is negatively charged over a working pH range of 2 to 12.   Proteins with a net positive charge at the working pH will tend to bind to the resin at a relatively low ionic strength and can be eluted at higher ionic strength or higher pH.' HmGCB binds to SP Sepharose at approximately pH 6 and intermediate ionic strength (e.g., 6.5 mSJcm) and can be eluted at higher ionic strength (e.g., 10.7 mS/cm). Impurity proteins remain bound to SP Sepharose<br>
15        under conditions of hmGCB elution, thereby purifying the hmGCB in the sample. For<br>
example, the following protocol can be used to purify hmGCB by SP Sepharose Fast Flow® chromatography. Sodium chloride (2.0 M stock) is added to the Q Sepharose® flowthrough/wash until the conductivity is 6.3 mS/cm, The pH is checked and readjusted to pH 6.0 if necessary. Then, addition of sodium chloride stock is continued until the<br>
20	conductivity is 6.5 mS/cm. The material is filtered and applied to a column of SP Sepharose<br>
Fast Flow®, which has been equilibrated with 25 mM sodium phosphate, 44 mM sodium chloride, pH 6.0. After application of the load, the column is washed with equilibration buffer until the baseline is reached and eluted with 25 mM sodium phosphate, 84 mM sodium chloride, pH 6.0. HmGCB is found in the elution fraction.<br>
25	Another cation exchange resin, e.g., Source 30S® (Pharmacia), CM Sepharose Fast<br>
Flow® (Pharmacia), Macro-Prep CM Support® (BioRad) or Macro-Prep High S Support® (Bioliad), can be used as an alternative to SP Sepharose. The hmGCB can bind to the column at approximately pH 6 and low to intermediate ionic strength, such as 4 to 7 mS/cm. A buffer, e.g., 10 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.0, 10 mM MES, pH 6.0, 25 mM sodium<br>
30	phosphate, pH 6.0, or other buffer with adequate buffering capacity at pH 6.0 can be used to<br>
equilibrate the column. The ionic strength of the sample is adjusted by dilution or<br><br>
WO 02/15927	PCTYUS01/25882<br>
diafiltratioii-to a level which will accommodate binding to the column. The sample'is applied to the column sd the cohsss is washed after the load to remove unbound material. A salt, e.g., sodium chloride or potassium chloride, can be used to elute the hmGCB from the column. Alternatively, the hmGCB" can be eluted from the column with a buffer of higher 5        pH or a combination of higher sah concentration and higher pH.<br>
The hmGCB can also be made to flow through the cation exchange column during loading by increasing the salt concentration in the equilibration buffer and in the sample load, by running the column at a higher pH or by a combination of both increased salt and higher pH.<br>

Superdex 200 Chromatography<br>
Superdex 200 prep grade® (Amersham Pharmacia) is used for size exclusion chromatography of hmGCB, whereby molecules are separated by size, molecular mass, strokes radius or hydrodynamic volume. Superdex 200 is composed of dextran covalently<br>
15	cross linked to agarose and has a fractionation range of 10,000 to 60,000 molecular weight<br>
for globular proteins. For example, the following protocol can be used to purify hmGCB by Superdex 200® chromatography. The S~P elution pool is concentrated by ultrafiltration using a 10,000 niw cutoff membrane. The concentrated pool is filtered, then applied to a Superdex 200 prep grade® column which has been equilibrated in 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.0. The<br>
20        A280 of the column effluent in the initial fractions is collected and, for example, an 8 to 16% SDS poly aery lamide gel is run to determine pooling of fractions. Pooling may be decided based on visual inspection of the silver-stained gel.<br>
Other size exclusion chromatography resins such as Sephacryl S-200 HR®, Bio-Gel A 1.5m®, or TosoHaas TSK Gel resins can also be used to purify hmGCB. The buffer used<br>
25	for size exclusion chromatography of hmGCB is 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.0. Other<br>
buffers can also be used such as 25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.0 containing 0.15 M sodium chloride. The pH of the buffer can be between pH 5 and pH 7 and should have sufficient ionic strength to inininiize ionic interactions with the column.<br><br>
W'6 02/15927'"	PCT/US01/25882<br>
Variations of pH. buffer and/or salt concentration in any of the purification protocols described above can be performed by rc-vrrfne medaods to achieve the desired purified product.<br>
Assays For Determining Macrophage Uptake and Cellular Targeting of hmGCB<br>
5	The uptake efficiency of hmGCB by macrophages can be determined by assaying,<br>
e.g., protein levels and/or enzyme activity in macrophages. For example, as described in the<br>
Examples below and in Diment et al. (1987) /. Leukocyte Biol 42:485-490, an in vitro assay<br>
using a macrophage cell line can be used to determine absolute and mannose receptor<br>
specific uptake of hmGCB.<br>
10	In addition, in vivo comparison of uptake of hmGCB and GCB by liver cells can be<br>
determined as described, for example, in Friedman et al. (1999) Blood 93:2807-2816. Briefly a mouse model can be injected'with hmGCB or GCB, and then sacrificed shortly thereafter. The liver of the animal can then be used to prepare a suspension of liver cells, e.g., parenchymal cells, KupfTer cells, endothelial cells and hepatocytes. The cells can then be 15        separated, identified by morphology and the protein levels and/or enzymatic activity of hmGCB and GCB in the various liver cell types can be determined. Alternatively, immunohistochemical detection maybe be used to localize hmGCB to a specific cell or cell type in tissue of treated animals.<br>
20        Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
High mannose glucocerebrosidase (hmGCB) can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration to a subject, e.g., a human. The composition can include a sufficient dosage of hmGCB to treat a subject having Gaucher disease. As used herein the language "pharmaceuticaily acceptable carrier" is intended to include any and all<br>
25	solvents, excipients, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic<br>
and adsorption delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical administration. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceuticaily active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, such media can be used in the compositions of the invention. Supplementary<br>
30        active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions.<br><br>
WO 02/15927	PCTYUS01/25882<br>
A pharmaceutical composition of-fee invention is formulated to be compatible with its intended route of adrmrdstratioiL Examples of routes of administration include parenteral e.g., intravenous, intradermal, and subcutaneous administration. Preferably, the route of adniimstration is intravenous. Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral application can include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as emylenedlaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders, e.g., lyophilized preparations, for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor EL™ (BASF, Parsippany, NJ) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyetheylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as manitol, sorbitol, sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged stability of the injectable . compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays adsorption, for example, aluminum monostearate, human serum albumin and gelatin.<br><br>
\V0 02/15927	PCT/0SO1/25882<br>
Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the hmGCB in the<br>
reqrfred amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients<br>
enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are<br>
prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle which contains a basic<br>
5	dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above, in the<br>
case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred<br>
methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying, e.g., lyophilization, which<br>
yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a<br>
previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.<br>
10	In one embodiment, the active compounds are prepared with carriers that will protect<br>
the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyandrydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of 15        such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be<br>
obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutical^ acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in 20        U.S. Patent No. 4,522,811.<br>
Treatment of Gaucher Disease<br>
HmGCB, e.g., any hmGCB molecule or preparation described herein, can be used to treat a subject having Gaucher disease. Alternatively, any mannosidase knockout cell 25        described herein, can be introduced into a subject having Gaucher disease to deliver hmGCB to the subject. Various routed of administration and various sites can be used. Once implanted in individual, the knockout cell can produce hmGCB.<br>
Preferably, the knockout cells used will generally be patient-specific genetically<br>
engineered cells. It is possible, however, to obtain cells form another individual of the same<br>
30	species or form a different species. Use of such cells might require administration of an<br><br>

Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder characterized<br>
by a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme, glucocerebrosidase (GCB). GCB hydrolyzes the<br>
5	glycolipid glucocerebroside that is formed after degradation of glycospliingolipids in the<br>
membranes of white blood cells and red blood cells. If GCB hydrolysis is insufficient then glucocerebroside can accumulate in macrophages (Gaucher cells), causing anemia, thrombocytopenia, organomegaly and major bone problems.<br>
There are several types of Gaucher disease including Gaucher type 1, type 2 and type<br>
10	3, which can arise due to various mutations in the GCB gene. A "therapeutically effective<br>
amount" of hmGCB. i.e.. a dosage of hmGCB sufficient to treat Gaucher disease, can be<br>
given to a subject having this disorder. The term "treat" as used herein refers to reducing or<br>
inhibiting one or more symptoms of Gaucher disease. Symptoms of Gaucher disease type I<br>
include: skeletal complications such as bone pain, bone lesions, osteopenia, osteonecrosis,<br>
15	avascular necrosis and pathological fractures; anemia; hepatosplenomegaly; splenic nodules<br>
and liver dysfunction; thrombocytopenia; and/or delayed growth and pubertal development.<br>
Symptoms of Gaucher disease type n include the symptoms of Gaucher type I as well as<br>
neck rigidity, apathy, catatonia, strabismus, increased deep reflex and laryngeal spasm.<br>
Symptoms of Gaucher disease type HI are similar to Gaucher type II except milder and later<br>
20	in onset.<br>
A therapeutically effective amount of hmGCB can be determined on an individual basis and will be based, at least in part, on consideration of the size of the patient, the agent used, the type of delivery system used, the time of administration relative to the severity of the disease, and whether a single, multiple, or a controlled release dose regimen is employed. 25        Preferably, the dosage of hmGCB sufficient to treat Gaucher disease is less than the dosage of human tissue derived or human placenta derived GCB, or GCB produced by cells in vitro and then trimmed to expose core marmose residues.<br>
Treatment of Other Lysosomal Storage Diseases<br>
30	Generally, the invention described herein can be used to produce proteins for<br>
targeting any cells that express mannose receptors on their surface. Thus, the invention<br><br>

described herein can be nsd H: T7=Et airy disorder in which it is desirable to target a protein for treatment to a mannese recepic^-zxpressing cell For example, the invention described herein can also be applied to other lysosomal storage enzymes and other lysosomal storage diseases in which cells, e.g., the cells of reticuloendothelial origin, accumulate undigested substrate. Reticuloendothelial cells include macrophages, Kupffer cells in the liver and histiocytes in the spleen. Such lysosomal storage diseases include, but are not limited to, Farber disease and Neimann-Pick disease.<br>
Farber disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder characterized by a deficiency in acid ceramidase. Ceramidases are enzymes responsible for degradation of ceramide. If ceramide degradation is insufficient then ceramide accumulates leading to granuloma formation and histiocytic response. (Moser, H.W. Ceramidase deficiency: Farber lipogranulomatosis; In: The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease (C.R, Scriver, AX. Beaudet, W.S. Sly and D. Valle, Eds.), Seventh edition, pp. 2589-2599, McGraw-Hill Inc., New York (1995))<br>
There are several types of Farber disease including Farber type 1, type 2, type 3, type 4, and type 5 which differ in severity and sites of major tissue involvement. There is also type 6 and type 7 Farber disease. High mannose acid ceramidase can be given to a subject having Farber disease to treat, i.e., alleviate or reduce at least one symptom, of the disease. Symptoms of Farber disease type 1 include: swelling of the joints (particularly the interphalangeal, metacarpal, ankle, wrist, knee and elbow), palpable nodules in relation to the affected joints and over pressure points, a hoarse cry that may progress to aphonia, feeding and respiratory difficulty, poor weight gain and intermittent fever. The symptoms usually occur between ages two weeks and ibis: months. Symptoms of Farber type 2 and type 3 include: subcutaneous nodulaes, joint deformities, and laryngeal involvement. These subjects survive longei than subjects having Farber type 1. Farber disease type 5 symptoms include psychomotor deterioration beginning at one to two and half years of age.<br>
Neimann-Pick disease type A and type B are an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder characterized by a deficiency acid sphingomyelinase. Acid sphingomyelinase is an enzyme responsible for degradation of sphingomyelin. If sphingomyelinase is deficient, sphingomyelin and other lipids can accumulate in the<br><br>

■mannose acid sphingomyelinase can he given to a subject havmg Neimann-Pick disease to treat, i.e., alleviate or reduce at least one symptom, of the disease. Symptoms of Neimann-Pick disease type A include: enlargement of the spleen and liver, lymphadenopathy, microcytic anemia, decreased platelet count, hypotonia, muscular weakness, psychomotor 10        retardation. Symptoms of Neimann-Pick type B include; enlargement of the liver and/or spleen, heptoslenomegaly; pulmonary compromise.<br>
Thus, high mannose lysosomal storage enzymes such as high mannose acid ceramidase or high mannose acid spingomyelinase can be produced by the methods described herein in order to target these proteins to mannose receptor-expressing cells.<br>

of GA-GCB is shown by the IEF analysis. With both drugs, a concentration dependent increase in the apparent isoelectric point (pi) was observed, with kifunensine causing a much -   larger shift in pi than swainsonine at the highest concentration tested (2 u.g/mL).<br>

Ten roller bottles (surface area, 1700 cm2 each) were seeded in Growth Medium<br>

weeks of growth, the medium was aspirated and 200 mL of fresh Production Medium<br>
5	(DMEM/F12, 0% calf serum) was added to three sets of roller bottles. Two sets of 4 roller<br>
bottles were treated with 1 ug/mL of either kifunensine or swainsonine. The third group of two roller bottles received no drug treatment. After approximately 24 hours, the medium from each roller bottle was harvested, pooled and a sample taken for GA-GCB enzymatic activity analysis. This procedure was repeated for seven days. Stable production of GA-<br>
10	GCB was observed for all roller bottles throughout the seven daily harvests (Table 1).<br>
Absolute levels of the enzyme, however, varied according to drug treatment group with the following average GA-GCB production levels observed across the seven harvests: 38.3±3.5 mg/L (control, no drug treatment), 24.5±4.0 mg/L (swainsonine, 1 pg/mL), and 21.3±2,8 mg/L (kifunensine, 1 pg/mL). Both drugs, therefore, resulted in stable, but lower production<br>

Effect of Kifaneasine or Swainsonine on GA-GCB Uptake into Macroohsss<br>
GA-GCB produced in HT-1080 cells was used in an in vitro assay re -issr~23s uptake efficiency in a mouse macrophage cell line. The specific objective of the experiment was to determine the absolute and mannose receptor-specific uptake of GA-GCB in mouse 5        J774E ceils.  One day prior to assay, J774B cells were plated at 50,000 cells/cm1 in 12 well plates in Growth Medium. For the assay, 0.5 mL of Production Medium (DMEM/FI2), 0% calf serum) containing 50 nM vitamin D3 (1,2-5, Dihydroxy vitamin D3) was added to the cells; Unpurified GA-GCB (from harvest 4, Table 1) was added to the test wells at a final concentration of 10 pg/mL in the presence or absence of 2 pg/mL mannan (a competitor for 10        the mannose receptor). Three different forms of GA-GCB were used: GA-GCB from cells treated with kiiunensine (1 ug/mL), GA-GCB from cells treated with swainsonine (1 pg/mL), and GA-GCB (1 pg/mL) from untreated cells. Control wells received no GA-GCB. The wells were incubated for 4 hours at 37°C, then washed extensively in buffered saline, scraped into GA-GCB enzyme reaction buffer, passed through 2 freeze/thaw cycles, arid clarified by 15        centrifugation. The supernantant was then quantitatively tested for enzyme activity and total protein. Internalization of GA-GCB into mouse J744E cells is shown in Table 2 and is reported as Units/mg of cell lysate. These results demonstrated that uptake of GA-GCB from kifunensine treated cells was 14-fold over background and 73% inhibitable by mannan and that uptake of GA-GCB from swamsonine treated cells was 7-fold over background and 67% 20        inhibitable by mannan. In addition, they also demonstrate that uptake of GA-GCB from<br>
untreated cells was approximately 3-fold over background and 53% inhibitable by mannam<br>
Thus, the inhibition of intracellular rnannosidases by either kifunensine or sw'airisomne<br>
results in GA-GCB that can be transported into cells efficiently via the mannose receptor,<br>
with kifunensine causing an approximately 2-fold greater uptake than swainsonine.<br>
25	Improvement in targeting of GA-GCB to cells via mannose receptors can therefore be<br>
optimized by production of GA-GCB in the presence of kifunensine or swainsonine.<br>
