				<td>CUTTING TOOL WITH GROOVED CUTTING EDGE<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates cutting tools, and in particular, to saw blades having<br>
novel teeth geometries for improved cutting.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
Toolmakers have long sought to improve the durability and functionality of<br>
tools by modifying their cutting edges. Early progress included work-hardening of<br>
metal and adding steel edges to iron implements. Progress continues to today with the<br>
development of new superhard materials. In general, the ideal cutting tool should<br>
combine abrasion-resistance (hardness) with shock-resistance (toughness). Since it is<br>
difficult to combine the properties mentioned above in a single material, saw blade<br>
nowadays usually comprise a relatively tough metal base with high bending fatigue<br>
strength and a cutting-edge band of a high-speed steel that is less tough but highly<br>
wear resistant. The cutting-edge band is of such a width that at least the tips of the<br>
cutting teeth of the saw band or blade, or even the cutting teeth as a whole, can be cut<br>
out from it.<br>
In general, it is desired to improve the cutting life of a cutting surface and to<br>
improve the quality of the cut. For example, the cut surface can be rough or uneven in<br>
those instances where the cutting edge becomes dull or the shape and orientation of<br>
the cutting teeth are not optimal. Similarly, cutting chips can accumulate at the<br>
cutting surfaces, thereby clogging the cutting path and impeding subsequent cutting.<br>
Improvements in cutting performance are continually sought.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a cutting tool with superior cutting and wear-resistant<br>
properties.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, a cutting tool comprising a base made of metal having<br>
a plurality of cutting teeth along an edge of the base, wherein at least one cutting tooth has at least<br>
one notch in the cutting edge of the at least one cutting tooth, and wherein the base has a first<br>
thickness at a first edge and a tapered region on the opposing edge of the base extending into and<br>
through an interior portion of the cutting edge member of the cutting tool, and at least one edge<br>
member comprised of a second metal is located adjacent to and forms a metallurgical bond with a<br>
surface of the tapered edge region of the base.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, a cutting tooth, for use on a cutting tool includes a cutting<br>
tooth having at least one groove in the tip of the tooth to provide more than two cutting angles.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, a method of making a cutting tool having a base<br>
and a plurality of cutting teeth along an edge of the base, comprising ; providing the base, the base<br>
having a first thickness at a first edge and a tapered region on the opposing edge of the base<br>
extending into and through an interior portion of the cutting edge of the cutting tool, and the base<br>
further having at least one edge member comprised of a second metal located adjacent to and forming<br>
a metallurgical bond with a surface of the tapered edge region of the base; and introducing a groove<br>
running longitudinally along the length of the tool in the cutting edge of the cutting teeth.<br><br>
As used here and throughout the specification, the term "about" refers to ±10%<br>
of the stated value.<br><br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides an improved cutting article having a novel<br>
cutting surface. Cutting tool 100 of the present invention is shown in side view in<br>
FIG. 1A. The cutting tool 100 includes a base 110 and an edge member 128 running<br>
along the length of the base 110. A finished product, e.g., a saw blade, includes<br>
cutting teeth 140 cut or machined in the edge member 128 of the cutting tool. FIG.<br>
1B is a fragmentary perspective view of the cutting tool 100. Cutting teeth 140<br>
include a notch or recess 150 in the cutting edge 160. The sloping or recessed region<br>
between cutting edges 160 is referred to as the gullet 175. (The cutting edge and the<br>
gullet may not be drawn to scale). A cutting tooth including a notch, groove, or<br>
indentation in the cutting edge increases the useful life of the tool, reduces shearing<br>
off of the cutting teeth and improves cutting performance. The lifetime of the tool is<br>
evaluated, in part, by determining the extent of tooth strippage over time.<br>
The "cutting surface" of the cutting tool includes the entire surface that<br>
presents itself to and engages with the object to be cut and includes the gullet, cutting<br>
edge and the side surfaces. As used herein, "cutting edge" means the uppermost<br>
portion of the cutting surface that engages with the object to be cut and that contains<br>
the notch. A "cutting corner" is formed at the junction of the cutting edge, sloping<br>
gullet and the side (or notch) surfaces. The number and location of the cutting comers<br>
may play a role in the tool's cutting performance.<br>
In one or more embodiments, the base 110 and the edge member 128 are<br>
integral, e.g., a single piece, and made from the same material. In other embodiments,<br>
the base and edge member are made from different materials, for example, the base is<br>
made from a first tough metal and the edge member is made from a second hard metal.<br>
In one or more embodiments, the base is a metal having desirable properties of<br>
mechanical and thermal stability, for example, under the conditions typically<br><br>
encountered in sawing or cutting operations. In general, the metal base can be any hot<br>
or cold rolled metal or metal alloy that is tough and spring-like. The metal base<br>
exhibits flexibility, and metals that exhibit flexibility, e.g., spring metals, can be used<br>
in the present invention.<br>
In one or more embodiments of the invention, the second metal used as the<br>
cutting edge is harder or more wear-resistant than the first metal. The edge member<br>
is a wear-resistant metal; for example, the edge member is made from a metal capable<br>
of withstanding the abrasive conditions typically encountered by the cutting edge<br>
under sawing or cutting operations. The edge member metal can be one or more high<br>
speed steels, including powdered metals. By way of example only, high speed steels<br>
include Matrix II, M2, M42, M51, M3 Type 1, M3 Type 2, and the like.<br>
The cutting tool includes at least one tooth having at least one notch or recess<br>
in the cutting edge; however, no other limitations are necessary. The cutting teeth can<br>
be of any conventional shape and geometry, as are dictated by the intended cutting<br>
application. The cutting teeth can be arranged in any way desired along the cutting<br>
surface. The cutting tool may include one or more notched teeth and/or may include a<br>
combination of notched and un-notched teeth. The teeth can be in or out of plane<br>
from the base, as is needed by a particular cutting application. In short, one is free to<br>
design the cutting tool as is most appropriate for a particular cutting application.<br>
Having determined the appropriate arrangement for the cutting teeth, the present<br>
invention improves the cutting edge by providing a notch or depression in the cutting<br>
edge.<br>
All types of cutting tools are contemplated according to the present invention.<br>
The cutting tool of the present invention includes composite saws (bimetallic saws)<br>
and those fabricated from a single metal. The cutting tool of the present invention<br>
includes conventional welded bimetallic saws and composite metal saws prepared<br><br>
according to one or more embodiments of the present invention. In one or more<br>
embodiments of the present invention, the blade is a toothed blade, e.g., a saw blade<br>
such as hand and powered hacksaw, hole saw, jigsaw, reciprocating saw and band saw<br>
blades. By way of example only, a blade can be welded, e.g.. butt-welded, to form a<br>
band saw blade.<br>
The notch is longitudinally oriented in the cutting edge of the tooth, that is, in<br>
the cutting direction. The notch of the cutting tooth can have a variety of geometries,<br>
as are shown in the non-limiting examples of FIGs. 2A-2D. FIG. 2A shows a cutting<br>
tooth 200 in cross-section having a square or rectangular slot 215. The notch is<br>
defined by the notch width W2 and notch depth D1. The notch is also defined relative<br>
to the total width W1 of the cutting tooth. In one or more embodiments, the notch<br>
width is in the range of about 5-50% collectively of the total width of the cutting edge.<br>
In one or more embodiments, the notch width is in the range of about 0.005-0.020".<br>
The sharp angular sides of the notch provide additional cutting corners 210, e.g., there<br>
are now four cutting corners instead of two. The increase in the amount of cutting<br>
corners may play a role in the observed improvement in cutting performance. Two or<br>
more notches 220 can be used, as is shown for cutting tooth 225 in FIG. 2B. This<br>
embodiment significantly increases the number of cutting corners of the cutting<br>
surface. The notch can be a v-notch 230 or a rounded notch 240, as shown in FIGs.<br>
2C and 2D, respectively.<br>
In one or more embodiments, the cavity defined by the notch contains a soft<br>
metal, organic polymer or other shock absorbing material. By way of example, a soft<br>
metal such as solder or base metal or other shock absorbing material such as epoxy is<br>
introduced into the notch. The filler material can act to dampen harmonic vibrations<br>
that may occur during initial use, before the teeth are "broken in". Harmonic<br>
oscillations are particularly common in teeth having a high aspect ratio, i.e., a deep<br><br>
notch. In one or more embodiments, the damping material is selected to be a material<br>
that wears readily with a few operating cycles of the saw. It has been observed in<br>
some cutting tools, that the fill materials wear away slowly and in proportion with the<br>
wearing of the cutting edge. A particular feature of the filled-notch embodiment of<br>
the present invention is that the notch is shallow and thereby retains much of the<br>
structural stability of the un-notched tooth; however, the cutting action of the cutting<br>
tooth continually wears away or "renews" the notch as the cutting tool is used. Thus,<br>
improved cutting performance is observed throughout the entire cutting life of the<br>
tool.<br>
The notch can be introduced into the cutting tooth using a variety of methods.<br>
For example, the notch can be machined into the cutting teeth of conventional cutting<br>
tools, such as single metal, powdered metal blade or a composite metal blade formed<br>
using conventional welding, e.g., electron beam welding, techniques. The notch is<br>
introduced into the cutting teeth of the blade using conventional tools such as a<br>
milling cutter, abrasive wheel, diamond saw, water jet, laser and the like. It will be<br>
appreciated that the different cutting techniques provide a range of cutting precision<br>
and notch characteristics. Thus, different cutting techniques are selected depending on<br>
the desired width and shape of the notch, among other characteristics.<br>
Any cutting tool will benefit by the notched cutting teeth of the invention. In<br>
one or more embodiments, the cutting tool is a conventional single component saw<br>
blade, and the notch is introduced into the cutting edge using conventional methods.<br>
In one or more embodiments, the cutting is a composite cutting tool including<br>
a tough metal base and a harder metal cutting edge. Composite saw blades, that is,<br>
saw blades made up of two or more dissimilar materials, have been prepared by<br>
welding a thin strip of cutting tool steel to an edge of a flexible alloy steel backer.<br>
Common welding techniques are electron beam welding and laser welding. A<br><br>
conventionally welded cutting tooth 300 including the notch 305 of the present<br>
invention is shown in FIG. 3A. A shear line 310 indicates the point at which the edge<br>
is conventionally welded to base 320. The notch is introduced into the cutting tooth<br>
using conventional methods.<br>
In one or more embodiments of the present invention, the composite metal<br>
cutting tools contain of cutting teeth formed from a combination of a hard cutting tool<br>
metal and a softer, supporting metal, which inherently provide a notched cutting tooth.<br>
The cutting edge presented to a surface to be cut includes alternating regions of hard<br>
cutting tool metal and softer metal. The soft metal can be provided in the form of a<br>
metal-filled notch in the harder cutting tool metal. FIG. 3B illustrates a composite<br>
metal cutting tool of one or more embodiments of the present invention. The base<br>
metal extends upwards from the base 340 and towards the cutting edge in an interior<br>
location of the cutting tool. The metal base forms an extended taper 345 that serves to<br>
define the recess 325 between two faces 326, 327 of the cutting tooth. Thus,<br>
according to one or more embodiments of the present invention, the notch is formed<br>
by positioning a softer material between two faces of a cutting tooth. Notch 325 may<br>
be introduced during use as the first few cutting cycles preferentially erode the softer<br>
metal (or other material) of the area. In one or more embodiments, a metallurgical<br>
bond 330 is formed between the base and cutting teeth of the composite cutting tool.<br>
The length (and related area) of the bond is greater for the cutting tool shown in FIG.<br>
3B than for the that shown in FIG. 3A, thereby providing additional advantages, e.g.,<br>
the composite cutting tool would be more durable, long lasting and more resistant to<br>
shear failure.<br>
More complex composite cutting tools having notched cutting edges are<br>
contemplated in accordance with the present invention. In one or more embodiments<br>
of the invention, a cutting edge 400 of a composite cutting tool 410 as shown in FIG.<br><br>
4 includes a plurality of alternating layers of hard cutting tool metal 420 and a more<br>
flexible, supporting metal 430. The innermost section 440 represents the thinned,<br>
tapered section of the metal base. The metal used for the flexible, supporting metal<br>
sections 430 can be the same as or different from the metal of the metal base 440.<br>
The metal components of the cutting edge are metallurgically bonded at shared<br>
surfaces. The thickness of the flexible, supporting metal sections 430 can be the same<br>
as or different from the thickness of the innermost section 440. For example, FIG. 4<br>
illustrates a composite metal article having three sections 430, 440, 430' of flexible,<br>
supporting metal of varying thicknesses. The number, thickness and location of the<br>
different metal regions in the edge member are selected to provide a desired property<br>
in the article.<br>
In one or more embodiments, the cutting tool is a hybrid article including a<br>
composite metal cutting strip that is welded, after fabrication, to a metal base. Cutting<br>
teeth are then cut into the composite metal cutting edge so that the alternating layers of<br>
cutting tool steel and soft metal provides the cutting edges and notches of the present<br>
invention. FIG. 5 shows a hybrid saw blade 545 using a conventional base 550. A<br>
composite metal cutting edge 560 includes a solid state bonded composite strip of<br>
alternating layers of hard cutting tool steel 565 and softer supporting metal 570.<br>
Notch 575 is formed in the soft supporting metal. The composite metal cutting edge is<br>
then attached at weld line 580 to the base using conventional welding techniques.<br>
The cutting edge includes alternating regions or sections of hard and soft metal<br>
that have been solid state bonded to each other as shown in FIG. 3B, FIG. 4 and FIG.<br>
5. In one or more embodiments, the material wears away only so far as to form a<br>
recess in the damping material (and thereby expose the new cutting edges of the<br>
cutting tool). During initial use, the soft metal regions wear away after only a few<br>
operating cycles of the blade and are recessed below the level of the hard cutting tool<br><br>
metal to form a shallow notch in the cutting surface. This provides additional<br>
advantages to the solid state bonded composite metal articles of the present invention,<br>
since the soft metal wears away as the cutting tool surface does so that the notch is<br>
continually being formed.<br>
The cutting characteristics of a notched cutting tool having rectangular<br>
geometry such as shown in FIG. 6 were investigated. FIG. 6 shows a notched tooth<br>
cutting tool 600 prepared by mill cutting a 0.008" wide x 0.010" deep rectangular<br>
notch 610 into a cutting tooth of a conventional composite saw blade. The base 620<br>
of the saw blade (0.042" thick) was made from D6A; and a M42 cutting strip 630<br>
(0.060" wide) was electron beam welded to an edge of the base. Electron beam weld<br>
640 is denoted by a broad line to illustrate the wide heat-affected region of the weld.<br>
Cutting teeth (not observable in this view) were cut into the cutting strip and the notch<br>
was cut with a 0.006" wide milling cutter before the tooth was set (oriented at the<br>
predetermined cutting angle).<br>
The tool was used under standard cutting conditions and the performance of<br>
the blade was compared to a comparable notch-less blade. The notched cutting tool<br>
demonstrated an extended cutting life compared to conventional notch-less blades.<br>
For example, the cutting life can be 25% or greater, even many-fold greater,<br>
depending upon the particular application. Improved cutting was observed in the<br>
notched blade until the cutting tooth wore down to the notch gullet base. Without a<br>
damping material, the saw blade vibrated noticeably during an initial breaking in<br>
period of the blade. Adding a damping material in the notch significantly reduced the<br>
vibration.<br>
While not being bound by any theory or any particular mode of operation, it is<br>
hypothesized that the notch provides additional cutting surfaces (corners) for<br>
improved cutting by chip breaking. In addition, the notch reduces the chip size of the<br><br>
sawn material and provides and additional clearance area (in the notch) for its removal<br>
from the cutting surface. Small chips are easier to clear, and the more efficient<br>
removal of the chips reduces wear on the cutting tooth and improves cutting<br>
performance.<br>
In one or more embodiments, the composite metal cutting tools of the present<br>
invention are prepared by heating an assembly of dissimilar metal components under<br>
pressure to form a bonded article, a process known as solid phase bonding. The<br>
composite assembly includes a metal base, such as a sheet or strip, having at least one<br>
depression or groove positioned longitudinally on one or both sides of the metal base<br>
that is capable of receiving an elongated metal element or wire. The wire can be of<br>
any shape, and is selected based upon any number of factors, including raw material<br>
availability, ease of manufacture, and the desire to complement the shape of the<br>
longitudinal depression of the metal base. An exemplary composite assembly 700<br>
including a metal base 710 and elongated elements 720,725 positioned in depressions<br>
730,735, respectively, of the metal base 710 is shown in cross-section in FIG. 7A.<br>
The composite assembly is then heated under pressure to bring the metal base<br>
and the elongated elements into intimate contact and to form a metallurgical bond<br>
between the component metals. In one or more embodiments, the composite assembly<br>
is first heated to a temperature that is above room temperature and below the<br>
temperature of any metallurgical transformation (Tm) of any of the metals of the<br>
composite assembly and then passed through a pair of rolls (a "mill roll") to exert<br>
bonding pressure and to reduce the article thickness.<br>
FIG. 7B is an illustration of the article 745 at an intermediate point during the<br>
heating and rolling process. The insert wires 720, 725 are pressed against and into the<br>
metal base. In one or more embodiments, the metal base is also being reduced in<br>
thickness. The greater the thickness reduction of the metal base (expressed as %<br><br>
reduction), the greater the forces experienced at the interface between the metal<br>
components. Thus, the wire size and shape and metal sheet thickness and groove size<br>
and shape relate to the bonding forces experienced by the composite assembly, and at<br>
the point where the insert wire(s) is introduced into the base groove, the large<br>
reduction forces favor stronger solid state bonding.<br>
Although the actual temperatures used will vary depending upon the materials<br>
and pressing procedure used, temperatures can range from about 800 to about 1600°F,<br>
or in some embodiments from about 1000 to about 1550°F. Heating can be<br>
accomplished using any conventional method. By way of example, the composite<br>
assembly is heated using inductive or electrical resistance heating. In one or more<br>
embodiments, the heat is supplied by a form of radiation, for example, laser radiation.<br>
Similarly, the actual pressures will vary greatly depending upon the materials<br>
and pressing procedure used. The pressure can be generated using any conventional<br>
method. By way of example, pressure is generated using a rolling mill or a turks head.<br>
Pressure is a function of many variables including, but not limited to, roll diameter,<br>
material deformation resistance (hardness), metal thickness, and the coefficient of<br>
friction between the roll and the metal being rolled, and the forces generated in rolling<br>
are well known in the industry. The addition of a hard insert wire, and in particular<br>
the addition of two wires stacked one on top of the other above and below the metal<br>
base, causes higher pressure at the point of contact - the specific location where high<br>
pressures are desired to improve bonding. The additional thickness locally due to the<br>
presence of the elongated element provides additional pressure for improved bonding<br>
during the solid phase bonding operation.<br>
FIG. 7C illustrates a final bonded article 758, in which the pressure has forced<br>
the second metal of the wire insert into the metal base and the article surface is<br>
substantially flat. The contact area between the wire and the base has increased<br><br>
considerably during the bonding process due to thickness reduction and article<br>
elongation. Increased contact area provides a large bonding interface and contributes<br>
to the high quality of the bond. The metal base 710 has thinned considerably in a<br>
bonding area 748 so that only a thin strip 740 of the metal base is found between the<br>
upper and lower regions 750, 755 arising from the former insert wires.<br>
The final bonded article 758 is then slit in bonding area 748 to form the<br>
composite metal cutting tool of the invention. As shown in the perspective view in<br>
FIG. 7D, the metal base 710 includes a tapered section 740 that is in contact with edge<br>
members 750, 755 on opposing surfaces the thinned, tapered section 740. Edge<br>
members 750, 755 are tapered complementary to the taper of section 740, so that the<br>
article surface is flat. The taper may be linear or curved, or a more complex geometry<br>
resulting from material flow during fabrication. The edge members 750, 755 and the<br>
thinned, tapered section 740 of the base 710 form a strong, i.e., metallurgical, bond at<br>
the opposing surfaces.<br>
Thus, in a few simple (and rapid) steps, the method of one or more<br>
embodiments of the invention provides a bonded article of a desired thickness. The<br>
starting materials can be thicker than those used in conventional electron beam<br>
welding processes, yet final thickness is achieved in fewer steps and less time,<br>
resulting in a significant savings in cost and materials.<br>
For more complex cutting edges, such as that shown in FIG. 4, a composite<br>
metal wire, such as that shown in FIG. 8A, is used in the bonding method described<br>
above. Wire 800 includes a metal 810, for example one that is similar to or the same<br>
as the metal used for the metal base, and a dissimilar metal 820. Metal 820 is harder<br>
than metal 810 and is located at an outer surface so that the harder metal provides<br>
increased wear resistance to the composite. The component metals are arranged in<br>
alternating regions and the metal regions are bonded at their interfaces.<br><br>
FIG. 8B illustrates a composite assembly 850 using the composite metal wire<br>
800 and a metal base 855. It is desired that the composite wire is aligned in a plane of<br>
the metal base and remains so aligned during consolidation and bonding. The<br>
composite wire 800 nests or fits snugly into a groove 825 of the metal base 855. In<br>
one or more embodiments, the composite wire is of a shape, e.g., trapezoidal and the<br>
like, that discourages rotation of the composite wire within the groove. Once the<br>
component elements of the composite assembly are arranged, the assembly is heated<br>
under pressure to form the bonded article as described above.<br>
FIG. 8C illustrates the final composite metal article 860 after the heat and<br>
pressure treatment of the present invention. The bonded region 865 includes<br>
alternating layers of metals 810 and 820 disposed in a bonding region 865 of the metal<br>
base. The thus-obtained composite sheet is slit vertically through the central section<br>
of the bonding region 865 to reveal an edge of alternate layers of hard metal sections<br>
(820) and flexible supporting metal (810, 855). An exemplary resultant article is<br>
shown in FIG. 4.<br>
For further detail on solid state bonding of composite articles, the interested<br>
reader is directed to United States patent application entitled "Composite Metal<br>
Article And Method Of Making" filed on even date herewith.<br>

invention have been shown and described in detail herein, those skilled in the art can<br>
readily devise many other varied embodiments that incorporate these teachings. All<br>
