FIBER OPTIC MODULE AND SYSTEM INCLUDING REAR<br>
CONNECTORS<br>
Field<br>
	The present invention generally relates to fiber optic<br>
telecommunications equipment. More specifically, the present invention relates to<br>
fiber optic modules and chassis for holding fiber optic modules.<br>
Background<br>
	In fiber optic telecommunications systems, it is common for optical<br>
fibers of transmission cables to be split into multiple strands, either by optical<br>
splitting of a signal carried by a single stranded cable or by fanning out the<br>
individual fibers of a multi-strand cable. Further, when such systems are installed, it<br>
is known to provide excess capacity in the installations to support future growth and<br>
utilization of the fibers. Often in these installations, modules including splitters or<br>
fanouts are used to provide the connection between transmission fibers and customer<br>
fibers. To reduce the cost and complexity of the initial installation and still provide<br>
options for future expansion, a module mounting chassis capable of mounting<br>
multiple modules may be used in such an installation.<br>
	While the chassis may accept several modules, the initial installation<br>
may only include fewer modules mounted in the chassis, or enough to serve current<br>
needs. These chassis may be configured with limited access to one or more sides, or<br>
may be mounted in cramped locations. In addition, some of these chassis may be<br>
pre-configured with the maximum capacity of transmission cables to accommodate<br>
and link to modules which may be installed in the future. Since it is desirable to<br>
have access to components within the chassis for cleaning during the installation of a<br>
new module, some provision or feature of the chassis will desirably permit a user to<br>
access and clean the connectors of these pre-connectorized and pre-installed<br>
transmission cables.<br>
	It is also desirable for the chassis to be configured to ensure that<br>
modules are installed correctly and aligned with other components within the chassis<br>
to mate with the pre-connectorized and pre-installed transmission cables.<br><br>
WO 2006/052675	PCT/US2005/039827<br>
Summary<br>
	The present invention relates to a telecommunications assembly<br>
including a housing and a plurality of modules mounted within the housing. The<br>
modules includes a rear face in which is mounted at least one fiber optic connector.<br>
Within an interior of the housing are positioned at least one fiber optic adapters.<br>
Inserting the module through a front opening of the housing at a mounting location<br>
positions the connector of the module for insertion into and mating with the adapter<br>
of the housing. The adapters within the interior of the housing are mounted to a<br>
removable adapter holder. The present invention further relates to a method of<br>
mounting a telecommunications module within a chassis.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
	Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary aspects of the<br>
present invention which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever<br>
possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer<br>
to the same or similar parts.<br>
	FIG. 1 illustrates a telecommunications assembly 10 with mounting<br>
locations 12 for mounting a plurality of modules 14. Assembly 10 includes a<br>
chassis or housing 16 with a first major side 18, a second major side 20 and a pair of<br>
opposing transverse sides 22 extending between the first and second major sides. A<br>
mounting flange 24 may be mounted to each of the major sides extending generally<br>
oppositely of each other. A secondary or alternative mounting flange 26 may also<br>
be mounted to one of the major sides to provide options for mounting housing 16 to<br>
a particular size or shape of equipment rack, cabinet or other type of installation.<br>
	Housing 16 defines a front opening 28 through which modules 14 are<br>
inserted within an interior 30 (shown below in FIG. 7) of housing 16. Openings 32<br>
may be defined in the transverse sides 22 to permit access by a person into interior<br>
30. Openings 32 may include a protective pad 34 about a perimeter to provide chafe<br>
and other-injury to any hands which may pass into or out of interior 30 through one<br>
of the openings 32. Visible through opening 32 in FIG. 1 is a housing 40 of one of<br>
the modules 14 mounted within front opening 28. Flanges 24 and 26 may include a<br>
plurality of fastener openings 36 for mounting housing 16 where needed in a<br>
telecommunications installation.<br>
	Referring now to FIG. 2, each module 14 includes a releasably catch<br>
42 adjacent second major side 20. As can be seen below in and described with to<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/052675	PCT/US2005/039827<br>
FIG. 10, catch 42 engages a portion of housing 16 to hold module 14 within front<br>
opening 28 and can also he deflected to permit withdrawal of module 14 from<br>
housing 16. Each module 14 also may include one or more cable exits 44 extending<br>
from a front face 46. Cable exits 44 permit telecommunications cables within<br>
module 14 to be directed outside of module 14, as will be described below with<br>
regard to FIG. 10. As shown in FIG. 2, front faces 46 of modules 14 are angled with<br>
regard to front opening 28, which may aid in the direction of cables exiting module<br>
14 toward a desired location in the telecommunications installation. It is anticipated<br>
that front faces 46 could be made generally parallel to front edges 38 of transverse<br>
sides 22 at front opening 28 within the scope of the present disclosure.<br>
	Referring now to FIG. 3, modules 14 includes unequal length flanges<br>
48 and 50 which are received within correspondingly sized slots 52 and 54,<br>
respectively. Flange 48 and slot 52 are smaller in size than flange 50 and slot 54.<br>
Slot 52 is sized so that, while flange 48 may be received within slot 52, larger flange<br>
50 will not fit. This ensures that modules 14 are positioned within front opening 28<br>
in a particular desired orientation. Similar flanges are described in commonly-<br>
owned U.S. Patent No. 5,363,465, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference. Opposite latch 42 and mounted to housing 16 at each mounting location<br>
12 are an adapter holder 56 releasably held within front opening 28 by a thumbscrew<br>
58. Adapter holder 56 is described in further detail below with regard to FIGS. 9 to<br>
16.<br>
	Referring now to FIGS. 4 and 5, housing 16 further includes a back<br>
60 opposite front opening 28, substantially closing off the rear of housing 16.<br>
Openings may be provided through back 60 to allow cables or air to pass, but it is<br>
anticipated that user access into interior 30 of housing 16 will be made through front<br>
opening 28. As shown in FIG. 6, on one end of modules 14, a lip or finger grip 62<br>
may be included to aid removal of module 14 from housing 16. Finger grip 62 is<br>
preferably positioned on module 14 opposite latch 42 so that a user may apply<br>
opposing force with fingers or hands to securely grasp the module and remove it<br>
from housing 16.<br>
	Referring now to FIG. 7, latch 42 of module 14 includes a recessed<br>
area 66 which engages an edge 64 of mounting location 12 to hold module 14 in<br>
place within front opening 28. Recessed area 66 is formed near a distal end of latch<br>
42 and a flexible portion 68 extends from recessed area 66 to a point of connection<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/052675	PCT/US2005/039827<br>
to a first side 70 of module 14. Flexible portion 68 is resiliency deformable and<br>
allows a user to deflect latch 42 to disengage recessed area 66 from edge 64 and<br>
remove module 14 from housing 16 or for latch 42 to deflect as module 14 is<br>
inserted into front opening 28 and engage edge 64. Module 14 includes a second<br>
opposing side 72 and a back 78. An intermediate rear face 76 is formed in second<br>
side 72 by an inset side portion 74. A pair of fiber optic connectors 80 is positioned<br>
in rear face 76 to mate with fiber optic adapters mounted to adapter holder 56 within<br>
interior 30 of housing 16.<br>
	Module housing 40 also includes a first transverse face 82 extending<br>
between first side 70, second side 72, back 78 and front face 46. A second<br>
transverse face 84 closes off the opposite side of module housing 40 between front<br>
face 46 and back 78 but extends beyond sides 70 and 72 to form flanges 48 and 50<br>
(flange 50 is not visible in FIG. 7). hi FIG. 8, flange 50 is visible as an extension of<br>
second transverse face 84 beyond side 70 of module 14. Module housing 40 may<br>
include curved transitions 86 between sides 70 and 72 and back 78. Transitions 86<br>
may be shaped to provide bend radius protection to cables within interior 30 as the<br>
cables extend to adapters 88. Alternatively, sides 70 and 72 may terminate directly<br>
at back 78, depending on the needs for placing components within module housing<br>
40 and efficiencies in manufacturing of module housing 40.<br>
	FIG. 9 shows assembly 10 with adapter holder 54 exploded out from<br>
interior 30. Holder 54 includes an extension 86 to hold and position a pair of<br>
adapters 88 to engage connectors 80 of module 14. Each adapter 88 includes a first<br>
or rear end 90 and a second or front end 92, and each of the first and second ends are<br>
adapted to receive a fiber optic connector which may terminate a fiber optic cable.<br>
	FIG. 10 shows a cross-section of assembly 10 with a first cable 94<br>
extending from connector 80 to an optical component 98, mounted within an interior<br>
96 of module housing 40. Optical component 98 may be a splitter or a fan-out or<br>
another type of optically significant element. First cable 94 may be a multi-strand<br>
fiber cable with a plurality of strands of optical fiber and optical component 98 may<br>
be a fanout to separate the individual strands into each of a plurality of second cables<br>
100. Second cables 100 extend from optical component 98 to cable exit 44.<br>
Alternatively, first cable 94 maybe a single fiber whose signal is separated by<br>
optical component 98 which is a splitter and a plurality of second cables 100<br>
carrying portions of the signal from first cable 94 may extend to cable exit 44. The<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2006/052675	PCT/US2005/039827<br>
arrangement of optical fiber and sheathing at cable exit 44 may be as disclosed in<br>
commonly-owned U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/658,802, the disclosure of<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
	An outside cable 102 may extend to rear end 90 of adapter 88 and be<br>
terminated by a connector 104. Connector 104 may be received in rear end 90 to be<br>
optically connected to connector 80 of module 14. Cable 102 may extend from<br>
interior 30 of housing 16 through an opening in one of sides 18,20, or 22 in housing<br>
16.<br>
	Referring now to FIG. 11, assembly 10 has a module removed from<br>
one of the mounting locations 12 and includes an alternative adapter holder 154 in<br>
that mounting location 12. Holder 154 includes a shield 108 in front of second ends<br>
92 of adapters 88. In some installations, a housing 16 may be installed and a cable<br>
102 led to and connected to first ends 90 of adapters 88, before a module 14 is<br>
placed in the associated mounting location 12. If cable 102 is illuminated and<br>
transmitting light signals, shield 108 will prevent accidental exposure to these<br>
signals which might damage eyes or other sensitive organs, or nearby<br>
communications equipment.<br>
	In FIG. 12, holder 154 includes an opening 124 through extension 86<br>
through which adapters 88 are mounted. Thumbscrew 56 extends through a front<br>
flange 114 and pair of wall engaging flanges 116 extend backward from adjacent<br>
front flange 114. Alternatively, other releasable features, such as snap fit devices,<br>
quarter turn fasteners, swell latches or similar features may be used in place of<br>
thumbscrew 56 on holder 54 or 154. Positioned between a forward end of each<br>
flange 116 and front flange 114 is a slot 118. Toward a rear end of flanges 116 are a<br>
pair of wall slots 120. As shown in FIG. 10, an inner wall 110 is positioned within<br>
interior 30 offset inwardly from first major surface 18. Wall slots 120 extend along<br>
both sides of inner wall 110. A turned-in forward edge 112 of first major surface 18<br>
engages slot 118. These engagements between housing 16 and holder 154 correctly<br>
position adapters offset from inner wall 110 within interior 30 to engage connector<br>
80 on rear face 76 of module 14. A central member 122 extends from front flange<br>
114 between wall flanges 116 to extension 86 to correctly position adapters 88<br>
within interior 30 between front opening 28 and rear 60.<br>
	Referring now to FIGS. 13 to 16, extension 86 of holder 154 includes<br>
a plurality of fastener openings 124 for mounting adapters 88 to extension 86.<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/052675	PCT/US2005/039827<br>
Fasteners 126 may be extended through side flanges 128 of adapter 88 to permit<br>
secure mounting of adapters 88. Adapters 88 are shown as SC style connectors,<br>
although other types, styles and formats of adapters may be used within the scope of<br>
the present disclosure and connectors 80 and 104 changed to mate with these<br>
alternative adapters. Within each of the adapters 88 shown may be an alignment<br>
device, such as a split sleeve 130 to correctly position optical fiber terminated in a<br>
ferrule and held by connectors 80 and 104. Such alignment devices and termination<br>
ferrules are well known in the art.<br>
	Shield 108 is curved when viewed from the side, as in FIG. 15, so<br>
that shield 108 will be deflected by module 14 as module 14 is inserted into interior<br>
30 through front opening 28 so that connectors 80 can mate with adapters 88. Shield<br>
108 is preferably made of a resilient deformable material that will return to the<br>
position shown in FIG. 154 when the module 14 is withdrawn from mounting<br>
location 12. Shield 108 may be connected to central member 122 by a pair of<br>
fasteners such as screws 132. Alternatively, shield 108 could be connected to holder<br>
154 by being formed integrally with holder 154 or by spot-welding or other<br>
fastening techniques. As rear 60 closes off the rear of housing 16 so that is no<br>
access to the rear any modules 14 mounted at a mounting location 12, providing a<br>
second shield 108 to block light from first end 90 of each adapter 88 is not needed as<br>
shown. However, if any sensitive equipment is mounted within module 14 or<br>
housing 16, it may be desirable to have a second shield 108 blocking first side 90 of<br>
adapters 88.<br>
	Insertion of module 14 into housing 16 at one of the mounting<br>
locations 12 may include first unfastening thumbscrew 56 and removing holder 54<br>
or 154 from interior 30 through front opening 28. Cable 102 preferably includes<br>
enough excess length or slack within interior 30 to permit adapters 88 to be pulled<br>
through opening 28. Once positioned outside of interior 30, connector 104 of cable<br>
102 can be removed from first end 90 of adapter 88 to permit a polished endface of<br>
an optical fiber within cable 102 to be cleaned. Connector 104 can then be<br>
reinserted within first end 90. Holder 54 or 154 can be reinserted within interior 30<br>
so that the holder engages inner wall 110 and inward turned extension 112 and<br>
thumbscrew 56 resecured. Insertion of module 14 into front opening 28 begins the<br>
mating of module 14 to housing 16 and adapters 88. Flanges 48 and 50 engage slots<br>
52 and 54, respectively, as module 14 is inserted. Connectors 80 and portions of<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/052675	PCT/US2005/039827<br>
second side 72 engage and deflect shield 108 (if present) as connectors 80 approach<br>
second ends 92 of adapters 88. Further insertion of module 14 brings connectors 80<br>
into and contact with adapters 88 and the connectors are received within second ends<br>
92. Latch 42 is deflected inward as module 14 is inserted and then springs back so<br>
that recessed area 66 engages edge 64. Module 14 is now mounted within front<br>
opening 28 and interior 30 at mounting location 12 and in position to process and<br>
transmit signals from cable 102 through first cable 94, optical component 98 and<br>
second cable 100 within module interior 96.<br>
