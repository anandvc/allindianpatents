				<td>BENEFIT AGENT CONTAINING DELIVERY PARTICLE<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This relates to benefit agent containing delivery particles, compositions comprising such particles, and processes for making and using such particles and compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Benefit agents, such as perfumes, silicones, waxes, flavors, vitamins and fabric softening agents, are expensive and generally less effective when employed at high levels in personal care compositions, cleaning compositions, and fabric care compositions. As a result, there is a desire to maximize the effectiveness of such benefit agents. One method of achieving such object is to improve the delivery efficiencies of such benefit agents. Unfortunately, it is difficult to improve the delivery efficiencies of benefit agents as such agents may be lost do to the agents' physical or chemical characteristics, or such agents may be incompatible with other compositional components or the situs that is treated.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for a benefit agent containing delivery particle that provides improved benefit agent delivery efficiency.<br>

Benefit Agent Containing Delivery Particle<br>
Applicants discovered that the problem of achieving effective and efficient benefit agent delivery can be solved in an economically acceptable manner when the desired benefit agent is coated with one or more coatings having a combination of compositional, physical and chemical characteristics. Thus, while not being bound by theory, Applicants' believe that the recited work of adhesion and percent of dissolution provide deposition efficiency, while proper compositional selection provides barrier characteristics that result in low benefit agent loss levels, which translates to more benefit agent being available when benefit agent release is required.<br>
Applicants' benefit agent containing delivery particle may comprise a core material comprising a benefit agent and a coating that coats at least a portion of said core material. Said coating typically having a work of adhesion of at least 0.2 millijoules, a work of adhesion of from about 0.3 millijoules to about 20 millijoules, or alternatively a work of adhesion from about 0.5 millijoules to about 10 millijoules, and a percent of dissolution of less than about 80%, less than about 50% or alternatively less than about 20%. Said benefit agent containing delivery particle typically has a benefit agent loss of less than about 70%, less than about 50% or alternatively less than about 20%. As a result, such benefit agent containing delivery particles may have benefit agent delivery efficiencies of up to about 80%.<br>
In one aspect of Applicants' invention Applicants' benefit agent containing delivery particle may comprise multiple coatings that are equivalent to said single coating. Said multiple coatings having a total work of adhesion of at least 0.2 millijoules, a total work of adhesion of from about 0.3 millijoules to about 20 millijoules, or alternatively a total work of adhesion from about 0.5 millijoules to about 10 millijoules,<br>

In one aspect of Applicants' invention, said benefit agent containing delivery particle should have interfacial tension such that the interfacial tension ratio may be greater than 1 or even greater than 5. While not being bound by theory, it is believed that the aforementioned interfacial tension ratio causes the substrate to prefer the benefit agent containing delivery particle over any delivery medium comprising the benefit agent containing delivery particle.<br>

Process of Making Benefit Agent Containing Delivery Particles<br>
The benefit agent delivery particle disclosed in the present application may be made via the teachings and examples disclosed herein.<br>
Typically, the benefit agent delivery particle disclosed in the present application may be made by applying one or more coatings having, a total work of adhesion of at least 0.2 millijoules, a total work of adhesion of from about 0.3 millijoules to about 20 millijoules, or alternatively a total work of adhesion from about 0.5 millijoules to about 10 millijoules, and a total percent of dissolution of less than about 80%, less than about 50% or alternatively less than about 20% to a core material that may comprise a benefit agent to form a benefit agent containing delivery particle, said one or more coatings being applied in a sufficient amount to provide said benefit agent containing delivery particle with a benefit agent loss of less than about 70%, less than about 50% or alternatively less than about 20%.<br>
In one aspect of Applicants' invention, said one or more coatings may have an interfacial tension such that the interfacial tension ratio may be greater than 1 or even greater than 5.<br>
In one aspect of Applicants' invention any cross-linking of the coating materials is performed prior to said coating step.<br>
In one aspect of Applicants' invention, benefit agent delivery particles are made by a coacervation process that may optionally be followed by a spray drying process. Such process may comprise the steps of dispersing the benefit agent or benefit agent contained within a barrier particle in a slurry of the adhesive coating material. A<br>
suspending agent (e.g. carboxymethyl cellulose) is added, followed by the addition of an anti-solvent (e.g. sodium sulfate) to cause a phase separation, and precipitation of the adhesive coating material onto the dispersed phase. The resulting slurry may be used as is or optionally atomized in a spray dryer to obtain dry particles.<br>
In another aspect of Applicants' invention, benefit agent containing delivery particles are made by an extrusion process. Such process may comprise the steps of mixing the benefit agent with the adhesive coating material in a twin screw extruder or a co-extruder to form a slurry that is passed through a die to yield noodles. The noodles can be ground to a powder of the desired particle size. A starch melt, that can improve the controlled release properties, can be added during the mixing/extrusion step.<br>
In another aspect of Applicants' invention, benefit agent containing delivery particles are made by an agglomeration process or a fluid bed coating process. Such agglomeration or fluid bed process may comprise the steps of spraying a slurry of adhesive coated benefit agent particles (made by a coacervation process as described above) on to a fluidized bed of carrier particles. The carrier particles may have a diameter 5 times or alternatively 9 times that of the diameter of the particles in the spray slurry.<br>
In another aspect of Applicants' invention, the coating material is added directly during the manufacture of the benefit agent containing delivery particles. Such a process may comprise the steps of forming an emulsion of the benefit agent, then depositing a wall on the surface of the benefit agent, and adjusting the reaction conditions to crosslink the wall material. The coating material may be added to the slurry containing benefit agent during the cross-linking reaction step. Alternatively, the coating material may be added at the last stage of the manufacture of the benefit agent containing particle, together with an agent that can covalently link the coating material to the surface of the benefit agent containing delivery particle. While not being bound by theory, it is believed that such a mode of addition minimizes the dissolution of the coating material and also substantially reduces the quantity of coating material required to achieve the delivery efficiency of particles.<br>
In one aspect of Applicants' invention said benefit agent containing delivery particle may be produced using any combination of the process steps previously described.<br>
Suitable equipment for use in the processes disclosed herein may include paddle mixers, ploughshear mixers, ribbon blenders, vertical axis granulators and drum mixers, both in batch and, where available, in continuous process configurations, spray dryers, and extruders.

5.)    Deposition Efficiency Test: this test comprises three steps. The first step is to prepare benefit agent coated particles with a tracer (e.g. an element that is not present on the fabrics or the cleaning composition to be utilized). The second step is to perform a wash test by adding a known amount of benefit agent containing particle to a washing process, followed by sufficient drying of the substrate. The third step is to collect representative samples of the washed substrate, and measure the elemental composition. The washing method may be different based on the benefit to be delivered; however an example laundering method is provided below illustrating these steps.<br>
a.) Prepare the benefit agent containing delivery particle with a tracer: incorporate zeolite 13X supplied by UOP LLC in the particle preparation process at a level of 10 wt % of the particle (15 wt% Aluminum, 27 wt% Silicon in this zeolite). Alternatively, one can incorporate a colloidal silica dispersion (Ludox HS-30 from Grace Davison of Maryland, USA) at a level of 10wt% of the particle, b.) Perform a laundering wash test by adding 2.5 g of the benefit agent containing delivery particle to a washer having a diameter of 10 inches, height of 8.5 inches, and an agitator having a diameter of 1.5 inches, height of 9.5 inches, and base of 6 inches.   The washer is filled with 7 liters of deionized water at 32 °C, 7 cotton terry fabrics (12" x 12" wash towels composed of 86% polycotton, 14% polyester EuroSoft brand cotton terries manufactured by Silara Exports Ltd of India). Powder detergent having a composition similar to that listed in Example 11 (but nil zeolite) is added to the washing machine. The washing cycle comprises: 12 minutes wash at 80 RPM agitation, 2 minute spin cycle, 2 minute rinse cycle with water at 16 °C, followed by a 2 minute spin cycle. The fabrics are then machine dried in a tumble dryer for 45 minutes, c.) At least 3 separate wash trials must be conducted with the benefit agent<br>
containing delivery particle. Six representative fabric swatches (0.50 grams each) are collected. The fabrics are digested with nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid. To<br>
0.50 grams of fabric is added 10.00 mL of concentrated nitric acid, and 0.200 mL of hydrofluoric acid. The sample is digested using a Ethos Plus Microwave Labstation (manufactured by Milestone, Inc. of Monroe, CT, USA) using the following 4-cycle program: 3 minutes at 85°C maximum power of 700 Watts, 9 minutes at 145°C maximum power of 500 Watts, 4 minutes at 200°C maximum power 1000 Watts, 14 minutes at 200° C maximum power 1000 Watts, d.) The digested fabrics are then diluted 50 to 1 with deionized water. The diluted slurry is fed to a Perkin Elmer Optima 4300 DV spectrometer (by Perkin Elmer of Chicago, IL, USA) and analyzed for the desired elements (silicon, aluminum) at the following instrument settings: Plasma 15 Liters per minute, Auxilary 0.5 Liters per minute, Nebulizer at 0.8 Liters per minute, Power of 1400 Watts, View Distance of 15 millimeters, Axial plasma view, wet aerosol analysis with 1.50 milliliters per minute of slurry flow via a peristaltic pump, 20 second flush time,<br>
with a quality control check every 10 samples, e.) The reported microgram element per gram substrate reported by the instrument is<br>
converted to a deposition efficiency by first subtracting the elemental composition of a control fabric (zero quantity of zeolite added), next multiplying the reported number by the total mass of fabric added to the washing machine (260 grams), then divided the quantity of element that is added to the washing machine (O.lSgrams of Aluminum, and 0.27 grams of Silicon in 1 gram of zeolite 13X), and finally multiplying by 100 to obtain a deposition efficiency as a percent. 6.)    Core Material Absorbent (BET) Surface Area Measurement<br>
Core material absorbent surface area is determined in accordance with the (BET) Surface Area Measurement protocol found in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, Volume 60, 1938, p 309.<br>
7.)    mterfacial Tension and Interfacial Tension Ratio: Separately measure the contact angle of the benefit agent containing delivery particle and the substrate to which said benefit agent containing delivery particle will be applied using a Kruss K100 Tensiometer according the protocol described in the Washburn Method (Washburn, E.W.; Phys. Rev., 17, 374, 1921) with the following exceptions: a.) Benefit Agent Containing Delivery Particle: Place a 0.45 micron filter paper at the bottom of a Kruss sample holder FL12. Add known mass of powder to the FL12, and place another filter paper on top of the powder. Next, screw down the piston<br>
of the sample holder. There should be enough mass of particle such that there is<br>
resistance during the last rotation of the piston screw. b.) Substrate: Saturate the substrate with D.I. water and then immediately measure<br>
such substrate's contact angle.<br>
Once the substrate and benefit agent containing delivery particle are prepared, use the tensiometer to assess the contact angle of the benefit agent containing delivery particle and substrate samples to three separate probe fluids: hexane, ethylene glycol, and diiodomethane. From the contact angle data, and known polar &amp; dispersive components of surface tension of the probe liquids, use Fowkes equation (Fowkes, P.M.; Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, vol. 56, No. 12, page 40, 1964) to calculate the polar and dispersive components of the substrate and benefit agent containing delivery particle. Use Good's equation (Good, R.J., Grifalco, L.A.; J. Phys. Chem., vol. 64, page 561, 1960) to calculate the interfacial tension of the D.I. water wetted substrate, and the benefit agent containing delivery particle.<br>
Interfacial Tension Ratio is defined as:<br>
Interfacial tension of substrate Interfacial tension of benefit agent containing delivery particle<br>
