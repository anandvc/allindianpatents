PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF BENZOTRIAZEPINE<br>
DERIVATIVES<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of U. S. Provisional Application<br>
60/717,658, filed on September 16, 2005, which is incorporated by reference<br>
herein in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to novel processes for the preparation<br>
of benzodiazepine derivatives which are useful as gastrin and cholecystokinin<br>
receptor ligands.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
PCT publication WO 2003/041714, which is herein incorporated by<br>
reference, discloses benzotriazepine derivatives useful as gastrin and<br>
cholecystokinin receptor ligands. PCT publication WO 2003/041714 further<br>
discloses a process for the preparation of the benzotriazepine derivatives. This<br>
process however involves a slow reaction step and requires the use of excess<br>
ethyl hydrazine acetate (an expensive reagent), which makes the disclosed<br>
process disadvantageous for large scale / commercial production.<br>
The process of the present invention is advantageous over the prior art<br>
process by using smaller amounts of ethyl hydrazine acetate reactant and / or<br>
requiring shorter reaction times.<br>

R15, R17, R18 and R19 are independently H or Ci to C3 alkyl; and<br>
R16 is H, Ci to C3 alkyl or acetylamino.<br>
The prefix [N-Z\ refers to possible substitutions of an amino group in the<br>
following compound or substitutent name. For example, [/V-Z]alkylamino refers<br>
to groups of the form<br><br>
Similarly, [A/-Z]tetrazolylamino, wherein Z is Ci to C5 alkyl, includes<br>
groups such as tetrazolyl([N-methyl]amino and tetrazolyl[A/-ethyl]amino. Of<br>
course, when Z is H, no substitution is present.<br>
The term "halogen" or "halo" is used herein to refer to any fluorine,<br>
chlorine, bromine or iodine. Most usually, however, halogen substituents in the<br>
compounds of the invention are chlorine and fluorine substituents. Groups such<br>
as halo(Ci to C6 alkyl) includes mono-, di- ortri-halo substituted Ci to C6 alkyl<br>
groups. Moreover, the halo substitution may be at any position in the alkyl chain.<br>
The term "alkyl" is used herein to refer to both straight and branched<br>
chain forms. Further, the alkyl chain may include multiple bonds. Hence the<br>
&gt;     term "alkyl" also encompasses alkenyl and alkynyl groups. Likewise, the term<br>
"cycloalkyl" also encompasses cycloalkenyl groups. Preferably, alkyl and<br>
cycloalkyl groups as used in the present invention do not contain multiple<br>
bonds. Where there are preferred alkenyl groups, these are specified as<br>
alkenyl groups. However, specific reference to alkenyl groups is not to be<br>
i     construed as any limitation on the definition of alkyl groups described above.<br>
Wherein reference is made to dialkyl groups [e.g. di(Ci to C6<br>
alkyl)amino groups], it is understood that the two alkyl groups may be the same<br>
or different.<br>
I<br>
In the interest of simplicity, terms which are normally used to refer to<br>
monovalent groups (such as "alkyl" or "phenyl") are also used herein to refer to<br>
-15-<br><br>
WO 2007/035430	PCT/US2006/035887<br>
divalent bridging groups, which are formed from the corresponding monovalent<br>
group by loss of one hydrogen atom. Whether such as term refers to a<br>
monovalent group or to a divalent group will be clear from the context. For<br>
example, when L is -(CR17R18)V-Y-(CR17R18)W-, it is clear that Y must be a<br>
5     divalent group. Thus when Y is defined as thiazolyl, for example, this referes to<br>
a divalent group having the structure<br><br>
Where, as in this example, a divalent bridging group is formed from a<br>
cyclic moiety, the linking bonds may be on any suitable ring atom, subject to<br>
the normal rules of valency. Accordingly, by way of further example, the term<br>
pyrrolyl in the definition of Y includes all of the following groups:<br><br>
When a particular group is "substituted", that group may have one or<br>
more substituents, preferably from one to five substituents, more preferably<br>
from one to three substituents, most preferably from one to two substituents,<br>
independently selected from the list of substituents.<br>
With reference to substituents, the term "independently" means that<br>
when more than one of such substituents is possible, such substituents may be<br>
the same or different from each other.<br>
To provide a more concise description, some of the quantitative<br>
expressions given herein are not qualified with the term "about", it is<br>
-16-<br><br>
WO 2007/035430	PCT/US2006/035887<br>
understood that whether the term "about" is used explicitly or not, every<br>
quantity given herein is meant to refer to the actual given value, and it is also<br>
meant to refer to the approximation to such given value that would reasonably<br>
be inferred based on the ordinary skill in the art, including approximations due<br>
to the experimental and/or measurement conditions for such given value.<br>
As used herein, unless otherwise noted, the term "aprotic solvent" shall<br>
mean any solvent that does not yield a proton. Suitable examples include, but<br>
are not limited to DMF, dioxane, THF, acetonitrile, pyridine, dichloroethane,<br>
dichloromethane, MTBE, toluene, and the like.<br>
As used herein, unless otherwise noted, the term "leaving group" shall<br>
mean a charged or uncharged atom or group, which departs during a<br>
substitution or displacement reaction. Suitable examples include, but are not<br>
limited to, Br, CI, I, mesylate, tosylate, and the like.<br>
As used herein, unless otherwise noted, the term "nitrogen protecting<br>
group" shall mean a group which may be attached to a nitrogen atom to<br>
protect said nitrogen atom from participating in a reaction and which may be<br>
readily removed following the reaction. Suitable nitrogen protecting groups<br>
include, but are not limited to carbamates - groups of the formula -C(0)0-R<br>
wherein R is for example methyl, ethyl, t-butyl, benzyl, phenylethyl, CH2=CH-<br>
CH2-, and the like; amides - groups of the formula -C(0)-R' wherein R' is for<br>
example methyl, phenyl, trifluoromethyl, and the like; N-sulfonyl derivatives -<br>
groups of the formula -S02-R" wherein R" is for example tolyl, phenyl,<br>
trifluoromethyl, 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchroman-6-yl-, 2,3,6-trimethyl-4-<br>
methoxybenzene, and the like. Other suitable nitrogen protecting groups may<br>
be found in texts such as T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in<br>

Where the compounds according to this invention have at least one<br>
chiral center, they may accordingly exist as enantiomers. Where the<br>
compounds possess two or more chiral centers, they may additionally exist as<br>

present invention may be carried out in a variety of solvents or solvent systems,<br>
said reaction step may also be carried out in a mixture of the suitable solvents<br>
or solvent systems.<br>
Where the processes for the preparation of the compounds according to<br>
the invention give rise to mixture of stereoisomers, these isomers may be<br>
separated by conventional techniques such as preparative chromatography.<br>
The compounds may be prepared in racemic form, or individual enantiomers<br>
may be prepared either by enantiospecific synthesis or by resolution. The<br>
compounds may, for example, be resolved into their component enantiomers<br>
by standard techniques, such as the formation of diastereomeric pairs by salt<br>
formation with an optically active acid, such as (-)-di-p-toluoyl-D-tartaric acid<br>
and/or (+)-di-p-toluoyl-L-tartaric acid followed by fractional crystallization and<br>
regeneration of the free base. The compounds may also be resolved by<br>
formation of diastereomeric esters or amides, followed by chromatographic<br>
separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary. Alternatively, the compounds<br>
may be resolved using a chiral HPLC column.<br>

During any of the processes for preparation of the compounds of the<br>
present invention, it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or<br>
reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. This may be achieved by<br>
means of conventional protecting groups, such as those described in Protective<br>
Groups in Organic Chemistry, ed. J.F.W. McOmie, Plenum Press, 1973; and<br>
T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John<br>

subsequent stage using methods known from the art.<br>
For use in medicine, the salts of the compounds of this invention refer to<br>
non-toxic "pharmaceutically acceptable salts." Other salts may, however, be<br>
useful in the preparation of compounds according to this invention or of their<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
of the compounds include acid addition salts which may, for example, be<br>
formed by mixing a solution of the compound with a solution of a<br>

The present invention further comprises pharmaceutical compositions<br>
containing one or more compounds of formula (I), with a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier. Pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more of the<br>
compounds of the invention described herein as the active ingredient can be<br>
prepared by intimately mixing the compound or compounds with a<br>
-30-<br><br>
WO 2007/035430	PCT/US2006/035887<br>
pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding<br>
techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending upon the<br>
desired route of administration (e.g., oral, parenteral). Thus for liquid oral<br>
preparations such as suspensions, elixirs and solutions, suitable carriers and<br>
additives include water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives,<br>
stabilizers, coloring agents and the like; for solid oral preparations, such as<br>
powders, capsules and tablets, suitable carriers and additives include starches,<br>
sugars, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents<br>
and the like. Solid oral preparations may also be coated with substances such<br>
as sugars or be enteric-coated so as to modulate major site of absorption. For<br>
parenteral administration, the carrier will usually consist of steftle water and<br>
other ingredients may be added to increase solubility or preservation.<br>
Injectable suspensions or solutions may also be prepared utilizing aqueous<br>
carriers along with appropriate additives.<br>
To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, one or<br>
more compounds of the present invention as the active ingredient is intimately<br>
admixed with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional<br>
pharmaceutical compounding techniques, which carrier may take a wide<br>
variety of forms depending of the form of preparation desired for administration,<br>
e.g., oral or parenteral such as intramuscular. In preparing the compositions in<br>
oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed.<br>
Thus, for liquid oral preparations, such as for example, suspensions, elixirs and<br>
solutions, suitable carriers and additives include water, glycols, oils, alcohols,<br>
flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like; for solid oral<br>
preparations such as, for example, powders, capsules, caplets, gelcaps and<br>
tablets, suitable carriers and additives include starches, sugars, diluents,<br>
granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like.<br>
Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the<br>
most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical<br>
carriers are obviously employed. If desired, tablets may be sugar coated or<br>
enteric coated by standard techniques. For parenterals, the carrier will usually<br>
comprise sterile water, through other ingredients, for example, for purposes<br>
-31-<br><br>
WO 2007/035430	PCT/US2006/035887<br>
such as aiding solubility or for preservation, may be included. Injectable<br>
suspensions may also be prepared, in which case appropriate liquid carriers,<br>
suspending agents and the like may be employed. The pharmaceutical<br>
compositions herein will contain, per dosage unit, e.g., tablet, capsule, powder,<br>
injection, teaspoonful and the like, an amount of the active ingredient<br>
necessary to deliver an effective dose as described above. The<br>
pharmaceutical compositions herein will contain, per unit dosage unit, e.g.,<br>
tablet, capsule, powder, injection, suppository, teaspoonful and the like, of from<br>
about 0.1-1000 mg and may be given at a dosage of from about 0.001 -5000<br>
mg/day, preferably from about 1-1000 mfg/day, more preferably from about 10-<br>
200 mg/day. The dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the<br>
requirement of the patients, the severity of the condition being treated and the<br>
compound being employed. The use of either daily administration or post-<br>
periodic dosing may be employed.<br>
Preferably these compositions are in unit dosage forms from such as<br>
tablets, pills, capsules, powders, granules, sterile parenteral solutions or<br>
suspensions, metered aerosol or liquid sprays, drops, ampoules, autoinjector<br>
devices or suppositories; for oral parenteral, intranasal, sublingual or rectal<br>
administration, or for administration by inhalation or insufflation. Alternatively,<br>
the composition may be presented in a form suitable for once-weekly or once-<br>
monthly administration; for example, an insoluble salt of the active compound,<br>
such as the decanoate salt, may be adapted to provide a depot preparation for<br>
intramuscular injection. For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the<br>
principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier, e.g.<br>
conventional tableting ingredients such as com starch, lactose, sucrose,<br>
sorbitol, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate or gums,<br>
and other pharmaceutical diluents, e.g. water, to form a solid preformulation<br>
composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present<br>
invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. When referring to<br>
these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active<br>
ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the<br>
composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective dosage forms<br>
-32-<br><br>
WO 2007/035430	PCT/US2006/035887<br>
such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation composition is<br>
then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing<br>
from 0.1 to about 1000 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention.<br>
The tablets or pills of the novel composition can be coated or otherwise<br>
compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged<br>
action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an<br>
outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the<br>
former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which<br>
serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permits the inner component<br>
to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of<br>
material can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials<br>
including a number of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl<br>
alcohol and cellulose acetate.<br>
The liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the present invention<br>
may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include, aqueous<br>
solutions, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored<br>
emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil or<br>
peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles. Suitable<br>
dispersing or suspending agents for aqueous suspensions, include synthetic<br>
and natural gums such as tragacanth, acacia, alginate, dextran, sodium<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone or gelatin.<br>
The method of treating a disorder related to a gastrin and / or<br>
cholecystokinin receptor described in the present invention may also be carried<br>
out using a pharmaceutical composition comprising any of the compounds as<br>
defined herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical<br>
composition may contain between about 0.1 mg and 1000 mg, preferably about 1<br>
to 500 mg, more preferably about 5 to 500 mg, of the compound, and may be<br>
constituted into any form suitable for the mode of administration selected.<br>
Carriers include necessary and inert pharmaceutical excipients, including, but not<br>
limited to, binders, suspending agents, lubricants, flavorants, sweeteners,<br>
preservatives, dyes, and coatings. Compositions suitable for oral administration<br>
-33-<br><br>
WO 2007/035430	PCT/US2006/035887<br>
include solid forms, such as pills, tablets, caplets, capsules (each including<br>
immediate release, timed release and sustained release formulations), granules,<br>
and powders, and liquid forms, such as solutions, syrups, elixers, emulsions, and<br>
suspensions. Forms useful for parenteral administration include sterile solutions,<br>
emulsions and suspensions.<br>
Advantageously, compounds of the present invention may be administered<br>
in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided<br>
doses of two, three or four times daily. Furthermore, compounds for the present<br>
invention can be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable<br>
intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal skin patches well known to those of<br>
ordinary skill in that art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery<br>
system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than<br>
intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.<br>
For instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the<br>
active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable inert carrier such as EtOH, glycerol, water and the like. Moreover,<br>
when desired or necessary, suitable binders; lubricants, disintegrating agents and<br>
coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders<br>
include, without limitation, starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-<br>
lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth<br>
or sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate,<br>
sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like. Disintegrators include, without<br>
limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum and the like.<br>
The liquid forms in suitably flavored suspending or dispersing agents such<br>
as the synthetic and natural gums, for example, tragacanth, acacia, methyl-<br>
cellulose and the like. For parenteral administration, sterile suspensions and<br>
solutions are desired. Isotonic preparations which generally contain suitable<br>
preservatives are employed when intravenous administration is desired.<br>

The compound of the present invention can also be administered in the<br>
form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large<br>
unilamellar vesicles, and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a<br>
variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine or<br>
phophatidylcholines.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may also be delivered by the use of<br>
monoclonal antibodies as individual carriers to which the compound molecules<br>
are coupled. The compounds of the present invention may also be coupled with<br>
soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamidephenol,<br>
polyhydroxy-ethylaspartamidephenol, or polyethyl eneoxidepolylysine substituted<br>
with palmitoyl residue. Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention may<br>
be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving controlled<br>
release of a drug, for example, polylactic acid, polyepsilon caprolactone,<br>
polyhydroxy butyeric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans,<br>
polycyanoacrylates and cross-linked or amphipathic block copolymers of<br>
hydrogels.<br>
Compounds of this invention may be administered in any of the foregoing<br>
compositions and according to dosage regimens established in the art whenever<br>
treatment of disorders related to a gastrin and / or cholecystokinin receptor is<br>
required.<br>
The daily dosage of the products may be varied over a wide range from<br>
0.001 to 5,000 mg per adult human per day. For oral administration, the<br>
compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing, 0.01, 0.05,<br>
0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 25.0, 50.0, 100, 150, 200, 250 and 500<br>
milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage<br>
to the patient to be treated. An effective amount of the drug is ordinarily supplied<br>
at a dosage level of from about 0.01 u.g/kg to about 50 mg/kg of body weight per<br>
day, preferably, the range is from about 10u,g/kg to about 10 mg/kg of body<br>
weight per day, more preferably, from about 10Ojig/kg to about 2.0 mg/kg of body<br>
-35-<br><br>
WO 2007/035430	PCT/US2006/035887<br>
weight per day. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4<br>
times per day.<br>
Optimal dosages to be administered may be readily determined by those<br>
skilled in the art, and will vary with the particular compound used, the mode of<br>
administration, the strength of the preparation, the mode of administration, and<br>
the advancement of the disease condition. In addition, factors associated with the<br>
particular patient being treated, including patient age, weight, diet and time of<br>
administration, will result in the need to adjust dosages.<br>
The following Examples are set forth to aid in the understanding of the<br>
invention, and are not intended and should not be construed to limit in any way<br>
the invention set forth in the claims which follow thereafter.<br>
In the Examples which follow, some synthesis products are listed as<br>
having been isolated as a residue. It will be understood by one of ordinary skill<br>
in the art that the term "residue" does not limit the physical state in which the<br>
product was isolated and may include, for example, a solid, an oil, a foam, a<br>
gum, a syrup, and the like.<br>
