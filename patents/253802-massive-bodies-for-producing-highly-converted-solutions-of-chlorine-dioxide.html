				<td>Title: MASSIVE BODIES FOR PRODUCING HIGHLY CONVERTED<br>
SOLUTIONS OF CHLORINE DIOXIDE<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Free molecular chlorine dioxide in solution is an effective agent for the<br>
control of microorganisms and biological film deposits. However, the most<br>
common way to produce such solutions of free chlorine dioxide is to use an<br>
expensive and complicated chemical generator (see for example U.S. patent<br>
5,009,875).<br>
British patent 608,068 teaches the use of organic acid anhydrides to<br>
convert chlorite anion to free chlorine dioxide at a generally neutral pH. The<br>
fire and explosion dangers that result from combining a strong oxidizing<br>
chemical, such as sodium chlorite, with an organic chemical are also well<br>
known. As a result of the low conversion ratio produced by the compositions<br>
of this British patent, and the dangers inherent in compositions combining<br>
sodium chlorite and organic chemicals, the compositions of this British<br>
patent have received little commercial interest.<br>
Recently, a membrane type device containing powdered chlorine<br>
dioxide precursor chemicals that produces a solution of free molecular<br>
chlorine dioxide when the device is immersed in water was described, see<br>
WO 99/24356. While this membrane device is superior to the prior art<br>
methods of producing chlorine dioxide solutions, the device has some<br>
shortcomings. It is relatively expensive (due to the cost of the membrane<br>
and of assembly), and the rate of chlorine dioxide delivery can be too slow<br>
for certain applications. Also, the device may float on the surface of the<br>
water/solution (due to entrapped air or chlorine dioxide gas), and this can<br>
result in the loss of some chlorine dioxide to the gas phase. Finally, the<br>
preferred membranes are insoluble in water, and may need to be removed<br><br>
from the chlorine dioxide solution after the chlorine dioxide generating<br>
reactions are completed. Removal of the spent membrane from the chlorine<br>
dioxide solution may, at times, be considered inconvenient.<br>
The prior art also describes attempts to produce, chlorine dioxide<br>
solutions from solid mixtures, including solid compacts such as tablets and<br>
briquettes, which are comprised, of materials that will generate chlorine<br>
dioxide gas when contacted with liquid water.<br>
U. S. patent 2,071,094 discloses dry solid compositions, including<br>
briquettes, comprised of a soluble chlorite and an acidifying agent which<br>
when contacted with water produce a "deodorizing reaction" as the dry<br>
composition begins to dissolve (see col. 1, lines 34-38 and col. 2, lines<br>
24-27). Upon reading this patent, it is not clear what is produced when the<br>
composition comes into contact with water. The substance, chlorine dioxide,<br>
is never mentioned and the only time the word "solution" is used it is with<br>
reference to an aqueous solution of sodium chlorite (see col. 1, line 58).<br>
Thus, it cannot be ascertained whether the inventor was attempting to, or<br>
indeed ever did obtain an aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide when his<br>
briquette was contacted with water.	<br>
U.S. patent 5,324,447 describes, inter alia, a tablet comprising a<br>
chlorine dioxide precursor (e.g., sodium chlorite) and an activator-component<br>
(e.g., an organic acid anhydride) which are present in amounts effective to<br>
produce (contact) lens disinfecting amounts of chlorine dioxide in a liquid<br>
medium (see, col. 3, lines 10-16). The term disinfecting amount is defined as<br>
such amount as will reduce the microbial burden by one log order preferably<br>
in ten (10) minutes or less (see col. 4, lines 11-15). This amount represents<br>
very little free chlorine dioxide, as even as little as 2 ppm of free chlorine<br>
dioxide can result in a 6 log bacterial reduction in 15 minutes. The patent<br>
does not disclose the amount of chlorine dioxide that is generated when a<br>
tablet of the invention is dissolved in water. Thus, all of the examples utilize<br>
aqueous solutions of stabilized chlorine dioxide and not water to test the<br>
tablets.<br><br>
U.S. patent 5,399,288 discloses a solid composition releasing chlorine<br>
dioxide immediately after dissolution in water (see col. 1, lines 5-7). The<br>
composition comprises a chlorite salt, an oxidizing chlorine releasing agent<br>
and a proton donor present in the ratio of 4:1:3 (see col. 1, lines 65-67).<br>
When the oxidizing chlorine-releasing agent is omitted from the composition,<br>
the final yield of chlorine dioxide obtained was 63% but after three days (see<br>
Example 5). Further, and importantly, this patent does not discuss the<br>
preparation of tablets (see col. 2, lines 19-21). Thus, it appears that only<br>
powdered mixtures of reactants are disclosed.<br>
U. S patent 5,719,100 discloses production of chlorine dioxide in an<br>
aqueous solution from a tablet comprising a composition of sodium chlorite<br>
and an acid activator wherein the composition requires a reaction-preventing<br>
barrier between the sodium chlorite, [i.e., a protective reactive coat is formed<br>
on the sodium chlorite before it is mixed with the acid activator (see col. 4,<br>
lines 61-63) and the acid activator such that the two active ingredients do not<br>
"explosively react" together prematurely (see col. 4, line 53), i.e., a stable<br>
composition is obtained (see col. 4, line 46 through col. 5, line 9).	<br>
The present invention provides an improved device in the form of a<br>
massive body for the production of chlorine dioxide solutions. This new<br>
device rapidly provides high-yield solutions of chlorine dioxide and<br>
overcomes shortcomings of prior art solid compositions for producing such<br>
solutions.	<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
This invention provides a massive body that rapidly produces a<br>
solution of chlorine dioxide when immersed in water. The invention also<br>
includes the solutions obtained when a massive body is immersed in water.<br>
As used herein the term "massive body" means a solid shape, preferably a<br>
porous solid shape, comprising a mixture of granular particulate ingredients<br>
wherein the size of the particles comprising the ingredients is substantially<br>
smaller than the size of the massive body. Such massive bodies may be<br>
formed by a variety of means known in the art, such as tabletting, briqueting,<br><br>
extrusion, sintering, granulating and the like. The preferred method of<br>
forming such massive bodies is by compression, also known as tabletting.<br>
For reasons of convenience, hereinafter references to tablets and tabletting<br>
shall be understood to be representative of massive bodies made by any<br>
method.<br>
The tablet is comprised of a source of chlorite anions such as an<br>
alkali or alkaline earth metal chlorite preferably sodium chlorite and one or<br>
more dry solid acid sources. Examples of such dry solid acid sources include<br>
inorganic acid salts, such as sodium acid sulfate, potassium acid sulfate,<br>
sodium dihydrogen phosphate, and potassium dihydrogen phosphate; salts<br>
comprising the anions of strong acids and cations of weak bases, such as aluminum chloride, aluminum nitrate, cerium nitrate, and iron sulfate; solid<br>
acids that can liberate protons into solution when contacted with water, for<br>
example a mixture of the acid ion exchanged form of molecular sieve ETS-<br>
10 (see U.S. patent 4,853,202) and sodium chloride; organic acids, such as<br>
citric acid and tartaric acid; and mixtures thereof. Preferably the solid acid<br>
source is a solid inorganic acid source, and most preferably is sodium<br>
bisulfate. Surprisingly, a very high conversion rate of the chlorite anion to<br>
chlorine dioxide is obtained by use of the tablets of the invention. Thus,<br>
when the equivalent weights of tablet ingredients in powdered form are<br>
added to the same volume of water as the corresponding tablet; a much<br>
larger amount of chlorine dioxide is produced by the tablet than from the<br>
powder. Reasonable variations in stirring rate and/or water temperature<br>
have little to no effect on this surprising phenomenon. Thus, the tablets of<br>
the invention have been observed rapidly to produce a highly converted<br>
solution of free molecular chlorine dioxide, meaning that the conversion ratio<br>
(chlorite anion to chlorine dioxide) is &gt;0.25. The term, conversion ratio,<br>
when utilized herein means the calculated ratio of the free chlorine dioxide<br>
concentration in the product solution to the sum of free chlorine dioxide plus<br>
non-reacted chlorite ion concentrations in the product solution. Further, the<br>
chlorine dioxide solution is rapidly produced in a safe and controlled manner;<br><br>
and when the chlorine dioxide concentration so produced is at typical use<br>
levels (0.5-200 ppm by weight) in typical tap water, the solution will contain<br>
substantially no free chlorine or hypochlorite anion and will have a generally<br>
neutral pH (i.e., pH 5-9). By the term, rapidly produced, we mean that total<br>
chlorine dioxide production is obtained in less than about 8 hours, preferably<br>
in less than about 2 hours and most preferably in less than about 1 hour.<br>
The tablets of the present invention may, if desired, contain optional additional ingredients, which may be useful, for example to assist in the<br>
tabletting process, to improve the physical or aesthetic characteristics of the<br>
produced tablets and to assist tablet solubilization and/or the yield of<br>
chlorine dioxide obtained. Such ingredients include but are not limited to<br>
fillers such as attapulgite clay and sodium chloride; tabletting and tablet die<br>
lubricants; stabilizers; dyes; anti-caking agents; desiccating filling agents<br>
such as calcium chloride and magnesium chloride; pore forming agents such<br>
as a swelling inorganic clay, e.g., Laponite clay available from Southern Clay<br>
Products, Inc.; a chlorine producing agent such as dichlorocyanuric acid and<br>
salts thereof such as the sodium salt (NaDCC); and a framework former that<br>
can react with one or more other constituents in the formulation to produce a<br>
low solubility porous framework structure in which the chlorine dioxide<br>
forming reactions may proceed. Effervescing agents such as sodium<br>
bicarbonate may be included in small amounts, but they can reduce the<br>
conversion of chlorite anion to chlorine dioxide by accelerating breakup and<br>
dissolution of the tablet.<br>
In general the tablets of the invention are superior to the prior art<br>
membrane device, see e.g., WO 99/24356, for the following reasons:<br>
Tablets are typically less costly than the membrane device because<br>
they can be manufactured at a high rate on commercially available<br>
equipment and do not require the expense of a membrane enclosure to<br>
function;<br><br>
Tablets generally produce chlorine dioxide at a higher rate than<br>
membrane devices, since the tablet does not have a membrane to restrict<br>
the escape of chlorine dioxide into solution;<br>
The membrane devices frequently float when they are added to water<br>
while the tablets of the invention sink in water so they lose little chlorine<br>
dioxide to the gas phase; and<br>
In one preferred mode, the tablet of the invention is completely<br>
soluble in water so the need to remove residue from the product chlorine<br>
dioxide solution is avoided.<br>
While not wishing to be bound by any theory of operation, we believe<br>
that the enhanced yield of chlorine dioxide which is obtained by the use of<br>
the tablets of the invention may be explained in the following way. The<br>
tablet device functions when water enters the pore space within a tablet and<br>
produces a concentrated, acidic solution of chlorite anion within the pore<br>
space. The acid and chlorite (and optional ingredients that may be present<br>
react under these concentrated conditions in the pores of the tablet rapidly to<br>
produce chlorine dioxide which diffuses out of the tablet into the bulk<br>
solution. 	For the tablets to function properly, it is believed important that the<br>
chemical reactions occur in concentrated solution within the pore structure.<br>
There is little or no chlorine dioxide formed when the equivalent tablet<br>
ingredients in powder form are rapidly dissolved in aqueous media<br>
The invention includes two general types of tablet devices.One type<br>
of device comprises tablets that are fully soluble in water, and the preferred<br>
formulation of such tablets comprises dried powdered technical grade<br>
sodium chlorite and a dried powdered acid source, preferably sodium<br>
bisulfate. Additional dried powdered ingredients such as magnesium<br>
chloride and NaDCCA may optionally be added to even further improve the<br>
yield and rate of production of the chlorine dioxide. The dried powdered<br>
ingredients are mixed and the resultant powdered mixture is compressed in<br>
a tablet die at a pressure sufficient to produce a substantially intact tablet,<br><br>
typically about 1000-10,000 lb/in2. The resultant tablets are stable during<br>
storage as long as they are protected from exposure to water (either liquid or<br>
vapor). The tablets rapidly produce a highly converted solution of free<br>
chlorine dioxide when immersed in water.<br>
The second type of device comprises tablets, which are not fully<br>
soluble in water at a high rate. They are designed to have (or produce) a low<br><br>
solubility or slowly soluble porous framework structure in which the chlorine<br>
dioxide forming reactions may proceed to substantial completion prior to<br>
dissolution of the porous framework. Generally tablets of this second type<br>
convert a greater proportion of their chlorite anion precursor chemical to<br>
chlorine dioxide compared to the fully soluble tablets described above.<br>
The preferred formulation for this second type of tablet device<br>
comprises dried powdered technical grade sodium chlorite, dried powdered<br>
sodium bisulfate and dried powdered calcium chloride, A dried powdered<br>
clay such as Laponite clay and dried powdered NaDCCA may optionally be<br>
added to even further improve the yield and rate of production of the chlorine<br>
dioxide. As with tablets of the first type, the dried powdered ingredients are<br>
mixed and the resultant powdered mixture is compressed in a tablet die at a<br>
pressure.sufficient to produce a substantially intact tablet, typically about<br>
1000-10,000 lb/in2. The resultant tablets are stable during storage as long<br>
as they are protected from exposure to water (either liquid or vapor). They<br>
rapidly produce a highly converted solution of free chlorine dioxide when<br>
immersed in water.<br>
Tablets of this second type generally provide more efficient<br>
conversion of chlorite anion to chlorine dioxide compared to tablets of the<br>
first type. It is believed that this occurs because the low solubility porous<br>
framework provides a favorable environment for the chlorine dioxide forming<br>
reactions to proceed until substantial exhaustion of the reactants.<br>
Chlorine dioxide formation in tablets of the second type of device is<br>
believed to occur substantially within the favorable environment of the pore<br>
space of the low solubility (or slowly soluble) porous framework. Since the<br><br>
favorable pore structure of this framework appears to remain substantially<br>
intact during this reaction time, substantially all of the chlorite anion has an<br>
opportunity to react and form chlorine dioxide under favorable conditions<br>
within the pores. This maximizes chlorite conversion to chlorine dioxide. In<br>
contrast, a device of the first type is being dissolved into the bulk solution at<br>
the same time that it is producing chlorine dioxide. Since it is believed that<br>
the reagents will only react at a practically useful rate under concentrated<br>
conditions (such as those that exist within the pores of the tablets), that<br>
fraction of the chlorite that dissolves into bulk solution prior to conversion to<br>
chlorine dioxide will substantially remain as chlorite and not be converted to<br>
chlorine dioxide under the generally dilute conditions of the bulk solution.<br>
The low solubility porous framework of the preferred composition of<br>
the second type of tablet device comprises a low solubility salt such as<br>
calcium sulfate and may additionally include a clay such as Laponite clay.<br>
The calcium sulfate preferably is formed from the reaction between calcium<br>
cations e.g., from the calcium chloride constituent and sulfate anions derived from the sodium bisulfate constituent. Other sources of calcium cations such<br>
as calcium nitrate as well as other sources of sulfate anions such as<br>
magnesium sulfate may also be used. The preferred clay, Laponite clay, is<br>
insoluble as provided and it is a swelling clay which, we believe,enhances<br>
the pore structure of the porous framework by forming cracks and cavities as<br>
it swells. We have found that forming the calcium sulfate framework in-situ<br>
via chemical reaction is particularly advantageous and that chlorine dioxide<br>
yield from such tablets is significantly better (nominally 25% better)<br>
compared to tablets in which calcium sulfate is a constituent of the initial<br>
powder formulation. The presence of the clay in addition to the calcium<br>
sulfate provides only a small improvement over the use of calcium sulfate<br>
without the clay.<br>
By low solubility or slowly soluble porous framework, we mean a<br>
porous solid structure, which remains substantially undissolved in the<br>
product solution during the period of chlorine dioxide production. It is not<br><br>
necessary that the porous framework remain wholly intact during the<br>
reaction time to form chlorine dioxide. One aspect of this invention includes<br>
tablets of the second type in which the tablet disintegrates into substantially<br>
insoluble (or slowly soluble) granules that release chlorine dioxide into<br>
solution. This is acceptable, we believe, because the size of the granules is<br>
still large relative to the size of the pores within the pore space of the<br>
granules, so the necessary concentrated reaction conditions exist within the<br>
pore space despite the breakdown of the framework into granules.<br>
In tablet devices of both types, it is preferred that the powdered<br>
ingredients be dry prior to mixing and tabletting in order to minimize<br>
premature chemical interaction among the tablet ingredients. When utilized<br>
herein the term dry means that each ingredient typically contains less than<br>
about 1%H2O.<br>
General Procedures for Making and Testing the Tablets of the Invention<br>
Tablet Formation:<br>
The individual chemical components of the tablet formulation are<br>
dried prior to use. The desired amount of each component is carefully<br>
weighed into a plastic vial. In the following examples, formulations are given<br>
on a weight percent basis. The vial containing all the components of the<br>
tab|et formulation is shaken to mix the components thoroughly. The<br>
contents of the vial are emptied into an appropriately sized die (e.g., 13-mm<br>
diameter for 1g tablet). The plunger is placed in the die and the contents are<br>
pressed into a pellet using a hydraulic laboratory press. The maximum force<br>
reading on the press gauge was 2000 pounds unless otherwise noted. This<br>
pressure on the tablet punch may be converted to pounds/in2 if the area of<br>
the face of the plunger in in2 is known (typically 0.206 in2 for a 1g tablet).<br>
The resulting tablet is removed from the die and placed in a closed plastic<br>
vial until use (typically within 10 minutes).<br>
Tablet Performance:<br>
The tablet is placed in a volumetric flask or container filled with a<br>
known amount of tap water. Chlorine dioxide evolution starts immediately as<br><br>
evidenced by bubbles and the appearance of a yellow color. The tablet is<br>
allowed to react until completion. Completion of the reaction depends, in<br>
part, on the tablet type and size. Typically the reaction time is 2 hours or<br>
less if a 1g tablet is partially insoluble and 0.5 hr. if a 1g tablet is completely<br>
soluble. When reaction is complete, the flask/container is shaken or stirred<br>
in order to mix the contents. Then the contents are analyzed. Typically,<br>
chlorine dioxide is measured by uv-vis spectrometry, using four wavelengths<br>
(the average value is. reported). Chlorite and chlorine are measured by<br>
titration of typically 25 ml of chlorine dioxide solution using procedures<br>
equivalent to those found in the text, Standard Methods for the Examination<br>
of Water and Wastewater, 19th Edition (1995) pages 4-57 and 4-58. This text<br>
is published jointly by the American Public Health Association, The American<br>
Water Works Association and the Water Environment Federation. The<br>
publication office is American Public Health Association, Washington, DC<br>
20005. Total oxidants are measured by titration using a Brinkmann<br>
Autotitration System, 716 DMS Titrino equipped with a massive platinum<br>
electrode (Brinkmann Part No. 6.0415.100). The method is an iodimetric<br>
titration in an acid medium based on the oxidation of iodide to iodine and its<br>
subsequent reaction with the titrant, sodium thiosulfate. The typical<br>
procedure was as follows. One. hundred milliliters of chlorine dioxide<br>
solution and a stirring bar were placed in a beaker and 2g of potassium<br>
iodide (Reagent Crystals) and 10ml of a 1N solution of sulfuric acid<br>
(Maliinckrodt) were added with stirring. The resulting solution is titrated with<br>
0.1N thiosulfate solution (Aldrich Chemical Co.). The endpoint is<br>
automatically determined by the Brinkmann Titrino software. This endpoint<br>
is used to calculate the concentration of total oxidants in the sample. The<br>
pH of the original chlorine dioxide solution is measured using a pH electrode<br>
either on the solution "as is" and/or diluted with sufficient water to give<br>
approximately a 10 ppm concentration of chlorine dioxide.<br><br>
Results:<br>
In the examples below, the above procedures are followed unless<br>
otherwise specified. Formulations are given as weight percents of each<br>
component on a dry basis. Technical grade sodium chlorite was used.<br>
Typically the actual sodium chlorite content of technical grade sodium<br>
chlorite is approximately 80% and the remainder is approximately sodium<br>
chloride (8.5%), sodium carbonate (6.1%) and sodium sulfate (4.5%). Yields<br>
are calculated on two bases. The first is the wt% yield of chlorine dioxide<br>
based on the tablet weight, i.e., wt %yield = 100x(wt CI02/wt tablet). The<br>
second is the chemical yield based on sodium chlorite. In this case one<br>
must take into account that technical grade sodium chlorite is only 80% pure.<br>
Thus, chemical % yield = 100x(moles CI02 produced)/(moles of NaCI02 in<br>
tablet). The stoichiometry of the acid reaction of sodium chlorite to chlorine<br>
dioxide limits the yield to 80%.<br>
Conversion ratio is calculated as (wt chlorine dioxide)/ (wt chlorine<br>
dioxide + wt chlorite). If the chlorite content of the solution was not<br>
determined or is unknown, a "minimum conversion ratio" is calculated. This<br>
ratio is wtCI02/ wt total oxidant. Total oxidant typically consists entirely of<br>
chlorine dioxIde, chlorite and chlorine. The chlorine content of solutions from<br>
tablets typically low, so this minimum conversion ratio is a reasonable<br>
approximation of the conversion ratio.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
'Minimum ratio: ppm CI02/ppm total oxidant<br>
Example 9<br>
A one-gram tablet was prepared from the following formulation using<br>
6000 lb. pressure:<br>
0.167g Sodium Chlorite Technical<br>
0.500 g Sodium Bisulfate<br>
0.330 g Sodium Chloride<br>
The tablet was placed in 1 liter of tap water and analyzed after 10 minutes<br>
(all components soluble).<br><br>
Example 10<br>
Three tablets of varying size were prepared from a single formulation<br>
as shown below. The tablets were placed in enough tap water so the final<br>
concentration of chlorine dioxide would be 100-200 ppm. Since larger<br>
tablets take more time to release chlorine dioxide, the reaction time was<br>
adjusted (as shown) to insure that sampling occurred when reaction was<br>
complete. Different dies were used to press the tablets such that the<br><br>
height/diameter ratios for the tablets were substantially equivalent and the<br>
pressure used to press the tablets were approximately the same on a<br>
force/unit cross sectional area basis.<br><br>

 There tablets of varying size were prepared from a single formulation shown below. The tablets were placed in enough tap water so the final concentration of chlorine dioxide would be 100-200 ppm. Since larger tablets<br>
take more time to release chlorine dioxide, the reaction time was adjusted<br>
(as shown). Sampling occurred when reaction was complete, i.e. after the<br>
tablet dissolved. Different dies were used to press the tablets such that the<br>
height/diameter ratios for the tablets were substantially equivalent and the<br>
pressure used to press the tablets were approximately the same on a<br>
force/unit cross sectional area basis.<br><br><br>
Example 12<br>
Various solids were added to the tablet formulation to determine if<br>
there was benefit from having these insoluble solids in the tablet: Tablet<br>
pressure was 6000 lb. unless noted. Reaction times were generally as long<br>
as the tablet still bubbled (released gas). The generic formuiation for the<br>
tablets is shown below:<br><br>
One-gram tablets were placed in 1 liter of tap water. Results are shown<br>
below:<br><br><br><br>
