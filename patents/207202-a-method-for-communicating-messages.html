The present   invention   relates   to a communication   device   able to communicate   in more   than   one  communications   medium,   and   in particular  to   a  communication  device   with  interaction between   the   communications   media.<br>
One  such communications medium is telephone.     Telephone instruments  with  caller  ID capabilities  have been in use  for some  time.     When  such instruments  receive a telephone call, they  also  receive  the  telephone  number of the calling  telephone and the  name of the person owning the calling telephone.    The telephone   number  and/or  name   may   be   displayed   when   the telephone  call  is  received.  The  subscriber can  then know  the person making the call, and prepare for the conversation or not answer the call at all.<br>
The caller ID capabilities are often combined with answering  machine  capabilities,   a  combination  termed   voice mail.    Should the intended recipient be unable to receive a telephone call, the caller records a message, which may be retrieved later by the subscriber.    The caller ID information is associated with the recorded message, and also stored. Should the  subscriber wish  to return the telephone call,  the associated caller ID information is retrieved and allows  the call to be automatically placed to the originating telephone number.<br><br>
Another  such  communications  medium  is  electronic   mail  (e-mail).     Electronic  mail communications devices  have also been in use for some time.    Such devices are coupled to a communications  network,  and  have  the  capability of receiving  e-mail messages  from  others  also connected to  that communications network.    In its most basic form, e-mail messages are textual in  nature,   and  are  generally  typed  at  a  alphanumeric  keyboard by the originator.    The recipient can read the message on an alphanumeric  display.     Extensions  to  the  basic  e-mail  system permit inclusion of, for example, sound files, image files, or other data files which may be seen in-line or processed as separate attachments.    The message is packaged in an electronic envelope, which is sent, via the communications network, to the recipient.      The envelope includes, among other things, the e-mail address of the recipient, the e-mail address of the originator,  and the e-mail name of the originator.<br>
In general, e-mail messages for a subscriber are stored in a system coupled to the communications network termed a mail box or mail server.    When the subscriber wishes, the mail box is  accessed from  the e-mail device  and  the  accumulated e-mail messages forwarded to the recipient and read.     The information from  the envelope, including the originating e-mail address  and e-mail name, is retrieved along with the message.    Should the recipient wish to reply to the e-mail message, the retrieved recipient e-mail address from the envelope allows  the return e-mail  to  be  addressed  automatically.<br>
Systems  for accessing messages  in various communications media in an integrated manner have also been described in the<br><br>
3 art.    U.S.  Patent 4,612,416,  issued September  16,   1986  to<br>
Emerson et al.,  illustrates  a PBX system  including different communications   functions   for   corresponding   communications   media (i.e.  voice mail, e-mail, facsimile, etc.).    When a subscriber checks any message function, all can be checked, and the user switched   transparently  to   which  ever  function  contains   a message  to  be  retrieved.<br>
U.S. Patent 4,837,798, issued June 6,  1989 to Cohen et al., illustrates a communications system including a centralized,  unified repository for received messages  in any communications medium, including voice mail, e-mail,  and any other media such as facsimile.    The central location receives notification of each, message received, and then notifies the recipient of the receipt of the message.    The centralized repository also performs conversion of the message from one medium to another (for example, from e-mail to voice mail via text-to-voice  generation)  to  the extent possible  to permit the recipient to retrieve  all messages in whatever medium desired.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,239,577  issued August 24,  1993 to Bates et al. illustrates a telephone system in which all telephone numbers (for example, home, home fax, business, business fax, mobile, etc.) for an individual are accessible through a publically available, centrally located,  directory of directories for that-individual.    A call intended for one of the  telephone  numbers  may  be  completed by specifying  another telephone  number (e.g.  home  telephone),  and  requesting  the desired other number (e.g.  business  telephone).     The desired telephone number is  found by consulting the centrally located<br><br>
4 directory  of  directories,  and  then  the  directory  containing<br>
that   individual's   business   telephone   number.<br>
U.S.  Patent 5,557,659,  issued September  17,   1996  to  Hyde-Thomson,   illustrates  a  system  in  which  the  e-mail  communicatior medium is used for both e-mail and voice mail.    Voice mail messages  are  converted to  sound  files  and  attached  to  e-mail messages which are, in turn, sent to the e-mail device of the subscriber.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,647,002, issued July 8,  1997 to Brunson, illustrates  a  system  in  which each different communication medium (i.e.  voice mail, e-mail, facsimile, etc.) has it's own message reception center (i.e.  mail box),  in the usual manner. Each message is duplicated when it is received, to the extent possible, and sent to the reception centers of each of the other communications media.      Each reception center is coupled to a synchronizer which maintains all of the mail boxes in synchronism.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,671,269, issued September 23,  1997 to Egan et  al.,  illustrates  a personal  computer based telephone system in which a telephone number, derived in any of a number of different ways, is  associated with each incoming telephone call, and if a return phone call is desired, the associated telephone number is used to place the return call.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,692,038, issued November 25,  1997 to Kraus et al,  illustrates  a centrally controlled communications  system involving several communications media in which a personal identification number is assigned to an individual, and each telephone  number  (or  other  identification  such  as  e-mail<br><br>
5<br>
Address) associated with that individual is searched in an order set by the individual when that individual receives a message.<br>
In addition, software products available at this time maintain a unified mail box for messages from different communications media. For example, Microsoft outlook e-mail client maintains a single mail box containing both e-mail and facsimile messages.<br>
It may, however, be desirable that a received voice mail message be replied to with an e-mail message, or vice versa. For example, a phone request for a document is best answered with an e-mail message to which the desired document is attached. Similarly, an e-mail message containing a document for which approval is sought may be best answered with a telephone call giving that approval. However, none of the above systems extract information associated with a message received in one communications medium and use that information to permit a user to reply to that message using a different communication medium.<br>
wo 98/23058 discloses a system for integrated management of messaging and communications over the internet. The document describes a system which allows a user to respond to a communication in one medium with another. The document, however, requires or assumes that the address information required for replying in a different medium has already been entered by the user. Furthermore the document does not describe what happen when the reply address has not been entered by the user.<br>
in accordance with principles of the present invention, a method and system for messages communications in different media is disclosed. A first message is received via a first communications medium. First address information associated with the first communications medium is extracting from the first communications<br>
AMENDED SHEET<br><br>
5/1<br>
medium, second address information associated with a second communications medium is determined automatically in response to the first address information. A reply for the first message is sent<br><br>
6 via   the   second   communications    medium    using   the   second   address<br>
information.<br>
Also  in  accordance with  principles  of the  present  invention,  a method  for  automatically providing a destination address  for a reply  in  a  first  communications  medium  to  a  message  received from  an originating  address  and  an originating  name  in  a second communications  medium  comprises  the  following  steps.     A correspondent data base contains a plurality of entries,  each entry   representing   a  correspondent   and   containing   an   address field and a name field for messages in the first communications medium, and an address field and a name field for messages in the second communications medium.    This data base is searched for a first entry containing the originating address in the address field for messages in  the second communications medium. If the first entry contains an address in the address field for messages  in  the first communications medium,  that address  is provided as the destination address.    If the first entry does not contain an address in the address field for messages in the first  communications medium,  the correspondent data base  is searched for a second entry having a name in the name field for messages in  the first communications medium corresponding  to the originating name.    If a second entry is found, the contents of the address field for messages in the first communications medium in the second entry is provided as the destination address and the first and second entries are merged.    If a second entry is not found, an address is requested from a user. The  first entry  is  updated by  storing  the  user-supplied address in the address field for messages in the first communications<br><br>
7 medium and the originating  name is saved in the name  field fo<br>
messages  in  the  first communications  medium.     The  user-supplied address   is  provided  as   the  destination  address.<br>
A  communications  device  according  to  the  invention  perr a user to easily reply to an incoming message in any communications  medium  by  a  reply  message   in  whatever communications media is most convenient,  regardless of which communications  medium was  used  to send the incoming message<br>

Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a communications device 10 according to the present invention.    In Fig. 1, a subscriber telephone line is coupled to an bi-directional terminal 5. Terminal 5 may, for example, be an easy-connect RJ11  type connector.    Terminal 5 is bidirectionally coupled to a processor 110 through a serial connection of a line interface circuit  102, a multiplexer (MUX)  104, a coder/decoder (codec) 106 and a digital signal processor (DSP) 108.    An output<br><br>
8 terminal of the multiplexer  104 is coupled to an input terminal<br>
of a speaker  112 and an output terminal of a microphone   114  is coupled  to  an  input  terminal  of the  multiplexer   104.<br>
An output terminal of a keyboard  116 is coupled  to an input  terminal  of the  processor   110  and  an  output  terminal  of the processor  110 is coupled to an input terminal of a display device  118.    A bi-directional terminal of the processor  110 is coupled to a serial port  120, and an output terminal of the processor 110 is coupled to an output port 122 to which a printer may be connected.    An output terminal of a non-volatile read-only memory (ROM)   124 is coupled to an input terminal of the  processor  110 and a bi-directional terminal of a read/write random access memory (RAM)  126 is coupled to a corresponding terminal of the processor 110.<br>
In operation, the processor  110 controls the operation of the communications device  10.    The processor reads and executes the stored program code in the ROM 124, accesses constants in the ROM  124 and reads and writes variable data from and to the RAM  126.    Further the processor exchanges data with the various input/output (I/O) ports:  the  serial port  120,  the printer port 122, the keyboard 116, the display device 118, and the telephone line port coupled to the DSP 108, all in a known manner.    Images are displayed on the display device  118 to provide information to the user, and depression of the keys on the keyboard  116  are detected to accept information from the 0 user.    A least some of the keys in the keyboard 116 are physically adjacent to the display device  118.    The image displayed on the display device can provides the labels for at<br><br>
9 least  some  of the  buttons  on  the  keyboard,  thus  providing<br>
dynamic functioning for those buttons,  ail  in a known manner.<br>
The communications  device  illustrated  in  Fig.   1   operates as both a telephone caller ID and answering machine,  and an e-mail  terminal.    The subscriber line is used to couple the device   10  to  the public  telephone  system.     The  public  telephone system is used in the normal way in a telephone mode of operation, and connects the device  10 to an e-mail server or mailbox in an e-mail mode of operation.<br>
In the telephone mode, an incoming telephone call from the subscriber line causes the device 10 to ring, either via a separate  ringer (not  shown)  or using  the  speaker-phone  speaker 112.    At this time, caller ID information, including the telephone  number of the originating  telephone  and the name associated with  the originating telephone,  is  extracted from the incoming telephone call by the processor 110 via the codec 106 and DSP 108, and displayed in the display device 118, all in a known manner.    The caller ID information is further inserted  into  a database of correspondent  information   130, maintained in a portion 130 of the RAM 126 in a manner to be described in more detail below.<br>
If the user does not answer the call after some predetermined number of rings (e.g.  4),  the processor  110 retrieves from the ROM 124 or RAM 126 a digitized version of a message for the originator of the incoming telephone call, for example asking the originator to leave a message.    The combination of the codec  106 and DSP 108 converts the digitized message into an audio message and supplies it to the originating telephone<br><br>
10 via the multiplexer 104.    The originator, in turn, can choose<br>
to dictate a message for the user.    That message is received by the  device   10, and digitized via the combination of the codec 106 and DSP  108.    The processor then stores the digitized message in a portion 128 of the RAM  126 allocated to storing such messages.    The caller ID information associated with this message is also stored with the message.    Other information about the incoming message, such as the date and time it was received, is also stored with the message in the message portion 128 of the RAM 126.<br>
In the e-mail mode, the processor 110 accesses the e-mail server by dialing the telephone number of that server, in a known manner.    E-mail messages for the user are retrieved,  and stored in the RAM 126, also in the message portion 128.    Each e-rnail  message  includes  identification  information,  including the e-mail address and e-mail name of the originator of the message.     Other e-mail information relating to that message may also be included, such as the date and time the message was sent, the location from which it was sent, routing information, etc.    The e-mail identification information is also stored with the message in the message portion 128 of the RAM 126.    The e-tnaii information is also inserted into the database of correspondent information  130, maintained in a portion  130 of the RAM 126 in a manner to be described in more detail below.<br>
When a message is received, the identification information relating to that message (e.g.  originating telephone number and name for telephone messages and originating e-maii address and e-mail name for e-mail  messages,  and possibly other related<br><br>
11<br>
information) is stored in a common database, as referred to above.     In this manner the content of the database  is maintained.<br>
Fig.  2  is a table describing the structure and contents of a  database  used  to  contain correspondent  information  in  the communications device illustrated in Fig.   1.    The structure of the correspondent database is represented in Fig.  2 as a table. Each row of the table represents an entry in the correspondent database  and represents  one correspondent.     Each entry contains a plurality of fields able to hold information relating to the correspondent represented by  that entry.     The fields  are partitioned into: a group of fields able to contain caller ID information including the telephone number, caller ID name, and other attributes  (represented by  an ellipsis)  related  to the telephone for that correspondent; a group of fields able to contain  e-mail  identification  information  including  the  e-mail address,  e-mail  name,  and  other  attributes  (represented by  an ellipsis) related to e-mail of that correspondent;  and a group of fields able to contain extensions to the correspondent information, including,  for example,  the facsimile  telephone number,  postal  address  and  other  such  information  (represented by an ellipsis).<br>
When a telephone call is received, the caller ID telephone number and name is extracted from the originating message in a known manner, as described above.    The originating telephone number is compared to the  telephone numbers stored in the caller ID number field of all the entries in the database.    If a match is found, then the caller ID name field of that entry<br><br>
12 is updated with the originating caller ID name,  in case  the<br>
name for that telephone number has changed.     If this happens, one  of the caller ID attributes, a status attribute,  is changed to "new".  For example, if the caller ID information for the originating  telephone call  is  the  number    555-4321   and  the name is "John Ray", then this search finds entry 1.    The database field containing the caller ID name is replaced with the name "John Ray".<br>
If no entry is found which contains the originating message telephone number in the caller ID number field, then the originating caller ID name is compared with the names in the e-mail name field of all the entries in the database.    In one embodiment, an exact match of the originating name is searched for.     In another embodiment, recognizing that the e-mail and telephone caller ID names may not be exactly the same, a closest match is searched for.    Such a search may be made by parsing both the originating message name and extracting last names and first name or first initial, then comparing them.    Or a search may be made on like sounding names using the known Soundex system.    If no match is found, then a new entry is created, and the caller ID number and name fields of that entry are filled with the caller ID number and name, respectively, of the originating telephone call.    For example, if a telephone call is received with a number 555-6789 and a name of "Dave May", there is neither a match for the caller ID number nor the e-mail name for such a person.    A new entry is created (for example, entry 7) and the caller ID number, 555-6789,  is inserted into the caller ID. number field of entry 7, and the<br><br>
13 caller ID name, Dave May. is inserted into the caller ID name<br>
field of entry 7.<br>
If no entry is found which contains  the originating message caller ID number in the caller ID number field,  but an entry is  found which contains date corresponding to the originating message caller ID name  in the e-mail name  field, then  the caller ID number and  name  fields  for that entry  are checked.    If there are entries in those fields, then this entry represents  a different correspondent,  but with  a similar e-mail name.    In this case, as well, a new entry is created, and the caller ID number and name from the originating telephone call are inserted, as described above.    For example, if a telephone call is received with a number 555-6789 and a name of "Bill Bey Jr.", The search of the database finds entry 2, but this represents a different correspondent.     A new entry is created (for example, entry 7) and the caller ID number, 555-6789, is inserted into the caller ID number field of entry 7, and the caller ID name, Bill Bey Jr., is inserted into the caller ID name field of entry 7.<br>
If, however, the caller ID number and name fields of that entry are  empty,  then it is  assumed that this  entry represents the same correspondent as  that of the originating telephone message.    In one embodiment, the caller ID number and name of the originating  telephone message are inserted into the caller ID number and name fields, respectively, of the entry. However, this assumption may not be correct.     In one preferred embodiment, data from this entry is displayed on the display device  118, and the user allowed to indicate whether this entry<br><br>
14 represents the same correspondent via the  keyboard   116.     If<br>
not,  then a new entry is made,  as described above.     In another preferred  embodiment,   a  list of entries  which  have  e-mail  names close  to the originating message caller ID name is  displayed on the display device  118, and the user selects one of the listed entries, or none at all, using the keyboard.    If an entry is selected, it is updated with the caller ID information, otherwise, a new entry is created.<br>
For example, if a telephone call is received with a number 555-9786 and a name Charlie Trei,  there is no match for the originating message caller ID number in any caller ID number field of any entry in the database.    However, there is a match for the originating message caller ID name in the e-mail name field of entry 6.    In this case the caller ID number and name fields are empty.    The data related to this entry (and possible other similar entries) is displayed on the display device  118. If the user accepts this entry as representing the caller, then the caller ID number, 555-9786, is inserted into the caller ID number field of entry 6, and the caller ID name, Charlie Trei, is inserted into the caller ID name field of entry 6.    If the user does not accept this entry as representing the caller, then a new entry (for example, entry 7) is created, as described   above.<br>
In a similar manner, when the communications device  10 receives an e-mail message, it parses the e-mail address and e-mail name from the message.    The originating e-mail address is compared to the e-mail address fields of all the entries in the database.    If an entry with a matching e-mail address is found,<br><br>
15<br>
the e-mail name is updated to the e-mail name in the originating message.    If no entry with a matching e-mail address is found  in  the  database,  the  originating  e-mail  name  is  compared to the caller ID name fields in all the entries in the database.     If a  matching entry is  found  and  the e-mail  address and e-mail  name  fields  of that entry are empty,  the user is allowed  to   indicate  whether  the  originating  e-mail  message comes from the same person as represented by  that entry, as described above in more detail.    If so, the e-mail address and e-mail  name  is  inserted into  the  e-mail  address  and  e-mail  name fields, respectively, of the entry.    Otherwise, a new entry is created with the e-mail address and e-mail name of the originating  message,  as  described  above.<br>
As can be seen, Fig. 3, in general when a message is received  (301)  in  either communications  medium,  the  message address (i.e. caller ID number for telephone messages, and e-mail  address for e-mail messages) is extracted from the message (302).    The message address field is compared to the address field for the communications medium of the message (i.e., for telephone messages, the caller ID number is compared to the caller ID number field, and for e-mail messages, the e-mail address is compared to the e-mail address field) for all the entries in the database (304).    If a matching entry is found (306), then the name field for the message communications medium is updated with the message name (i.e. caller ID name for telephone messages, e-mail name for e-mail messages).    The database  updating  is  then complete (310).<br>
If a match is not found (306), the message name field is<br><br>
16 compared to  the name  field in the other communications  medium<br>
(i.e.  e-mail  name  for telephone  messages,  and caller ID name for e-mail  messages)  for all  the entries  in  the database (312). If a  matching entry  is  found  (314),  then the  address  and  name fields  for the  message medium (i.e.  caller ID  number and  name for  telephone  messages,   and  e-mail  address  and  name  for  e-mail messages) are checked to determine if they are empty (320).     If not,  then  a  new  entry  is  created  with  the  message  address  and message  name  in  the  message  medium address  and  name  fields  in the new entry (316).    The database updating is then complete 318,     If the message medium address and name fields are empty, then  the  message  address  and  name  are  inserted  into  the  message medium  address  and  name  fields,  respectively  (322),  possibly with the approval of the user, and possibly with the user selecting one of a number of possible matching entries, all as described above.    The database updating is then complete (318).<br>
Referring again to Fig.  1, and the general operation of the communication device  10,  the display screen   118  displays general information, such as the current date and time, the number of messages received, etc.      The display screen also displays an integrated list of all messages which have been received, both telephone messages and e-mail messages,  in a list window.    Each entry in the list of messages shows the originator name - e.g. caller ID name for telephone messages and e-mail name for e-mail messages.    Using the keyboard  116, the user is able to highlight entries in the message list.    A detail  window  provides  further  information  about  the highlighted entry, such as whether it is a telephone or e-mail<br><br>
17 message,  the  caller  ID  name  and  number  for telephone  messages<br>
or e-mail  address  and  e-mail  name  for e-mail  messages,  the  date and  time  associated  with the  message,  etc.<br>
Using  the  keyboard   116,  the  user may perform  several functions  for each  message.    For example,  the message  may be retrieved.     For telephone  messages,  the  digitized  voice  message is retrieved  from the message portion   128  of the  RAM   126, converted to  audio and played back through the speaker  112 by the codec  106 and DSP  108 under the control of the processor 110.    For e-mail messages the textual body of the message is retrieved from the message portion  128 of the RAM   126,  and displayed on the display device   118.     For another example,  the user may desire to reply to the message.<br>
The user may reply to any message in either communications medium.    That is, the reply to any message may be by either a telephone message or an e-mail message.    When the user indicates, via the keyboard 116, that he wishes to reply to the message, a question is displayed on the display device  118 asking which communications medium is desired for the reply. The user supplies the answer to the question via the keyboard 116.<br>
The user may specify that the reply be sent in the same communications medium as that of the received message, in which case, the destination address of the reply is the address in the originating message.    I.e., for a telephone medium message the destination address is the caller ID number of the telephone message, and for an e-mail medium    message the destination  address is the originating e-maii address in the e-<br><br>
18 mail message.    More specifically,  to reply to a telephone<br>
message  by  placing  a  telephone call,  the communications  device 10 dials  the  telephone  which sent  the  message  using  the  stored caller ID telephone number.    To reply to an e-mail message, a reply e-mail envelope is  prepared using the e-mail address  in the   received  e-mail.<br>
However,  the  user may also specify that the reply  be  sent in the other communications  medium.    If a user wishes,  for example, to reply to a telephone message by sending an e-mail message,  the entry in  the  database containing the originating caller ID telephone number of the telephone message in the caller ID number field is found.    Then the e-mail address field of that entry is checked.    If there is an e-mail address in that field of that entry, an e-mail message header is automatically composed using that e-mail address,  and an e-mail composition screen is displayed on the display screen 118.    The user can then type in the body of the e-mail message using the keyboard  116,  and send the e-mail message when done.<br>
For example, referring to Fig. 2, if the user wishes to reply by an e-mail to a telephone message from caller ID number 555-1234,  the entry containing  that telephone  number in  the caller ID number field is found (entry 2).    The e-mail address field of entry 2 is then checked.    In entry 2, the e-mail address field is not empty but contains an e-mail address (<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="256747405c654c4c490b464a48">[email&#160;protected]</a>).    In response, an e-mail header containing the destination address of <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="236141465a634a4a4f0d404c4e">[email&#160;protected]</a> is automatically prepared, the user types the message, then sends the e-mail message.<br>
If there is no e-mail address in the e-mail address field<br><br>
19 of that entry, then the originating caller ID name is compared<br>
to  the names in the e-mail name fields in all the entries  in the  database.    As described above,  an exact match  may be searched for, a match of last and first names, or a match of like sounding names.    The user may also be allowed to accept or reject the matching entry, or select one from a number of closely matching entries or none at all.    If a matching entry is accepted, or one is selected by the userf then the e-mail address and name from the matching entry is merged with the caller ID number and name in the originating message entry to form a single entry.    An e-mail message header is then automatically composed, and a message composed and sent by the user,  as  described above.<br>
For example, if the user wishes to reply by an e-mail to a telephone  message  from  caller  ID  number 555-4321,  the  entry containing that number is found (entry  1),    The e-mail address field for entry 1 is empty.    Thus, the caller ID name (John Ray) is compared to the names in the e-mail name field of the other entries.    In this case an entry with a corresponding name, John Ray, is found (entry 3).   The data in entry 3 is merged with the data in entry  1 to form a single entry with the combined information.    That is, a single entry is formed having a caller ID number field containing 555-4321, a caller ID name field containing John Ray, an e-mail address field containing <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="5d170f3c241d3c3f733e322f33">[email&#160;protected]</a> and an e-mail name field containing John Ray.    This entry could be either entry  1  (deleting entry 3), entry 3 (deleting entry i) or a new entry, e.g. entry 7 (deleting both entries  1 and 3).    An e-mail header containing the destination<br><br>
20 address of <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9ed4ccffe7defffcb0fdf1f3">[email&#160;protected]</a> is then automatically prepared,  the user<br>
types  the  message,  then  sends  the  e-mail  message.<br>
If no matching entry is found, or none is selected by the user,  then  a message  is displayed on the display  screen   118 asking the user for the destination e-mail address for the reply to the telephone message.    The user enters the destination e-mail  address  using  the  keyboard   116.     The destination e-mail  address  entered  by the  user is  inserted  into the e-mail address field of the entry containing the caller ID information for the originating message, and the caller ID name is inserted into the e-mail name field of that entry.    An e-mail  message header is then automatically composed, and a message entered and sent by the user, as described above.<br>
For example, if the user wishes to reply by an e-mail to a telephone  message from caller ID number 555-1324,  the entry containing that number is found (entry 5).    The e-mail address for entry 5 is empty, and there is no other entry having data in the e-mail name field which the user finds matches the caller ID name Hank Day.    In this case, an e-mail address for Hank Day is requested from the user, which the user supplies via the keyboard  116,    The e-mail address, for example <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="5c14383d251c3f3e3d723f3331">[email&#160;protected]</a>, is inserted into the e-mail address field of entry 5, and the caller ID name. Hank Day, is inserted into the e-mail name field of entry 5.    An e-mail header containing the destination address of <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="5d15193c241d3e3f3c733e3230">[email&#160;protected]</a> is then automatically prepared,  the user types the message,  then sends the e-mail message.<br>
Similarly, if a user wishes to reply to a e-mail message<br><br>
2 1 by placing a telephone call, the entry in the database<br>
containing   the  originating  e-mail  address  of the  e-mail  message is  found.    The caller ID number field of that entry is then checked.    If there is a telephone  number in that field of that entry    then   the   telephone    number    is   automatically    dialed   by   t processor   110 via the DSP/08 and coder   106.    If, however,   there is no telephone number in the caller<br>
ID number field in that entry, then the originating e-mail name is compared to the caller ID name fields in all the entries in the database.    As described above, this search may be for an exact match, a match of last and first names, or a match of like sounding names.    In addition, the user may be given the opportunity to accept or reject the matching entry, or select one from a number of closer matching entries, or none at all. If a matching entry is found, or one is selected by the user, then the telephone number in the caller ID number field of the matching entry is  automatically dialed by the processor  110 via the DSP 108 and codec 106.    In addition, the caller ID number and name from the matching entry is merged with the e-mail number and name in the originating message entry to form a single entry.    If no matching entry is found, or none is selected by the user, then the user may insert caller ID information by entering a destination telephone  number.    The destination  telephone  number entered  by  the  user is  inserted into the caller ID number field of the entry containing the originating e-mail message information,  and the e-mail  name  is inserted into the caller ID name field of that entry.    The user-entered   telephone  number  is   then  automatically  dialed,   as<br><br>
22 described   above.<br>
As can be seen in Fig. 4, in general when a message is received in one medium and is to be replied to in the other communications  medium  (401),  the  entry  in  the  database  section 130 of the RAM   126 containing the originating address of the message in the fields relating to the communications medium of the received message is found (402).    The address field relating to the other communications medium is checked (404). If that field is not empty (406), then a message in the other communications medium is composed and sent using the address in the  address  field relating to  the other communications  medium (408).    The reply process then ends (410).    If that field is empty  (406),  then the  name contained in the originating message is compared to the name field related to the other communications medium in all the entries in the database (412).<br>
If an entry is found (414), then a single entry in the database is formed by merging the information contained in the entry relating to the communications medium of the original message  with  the  information contained  in  the matching entry relating to the other communications medium (416).    Then a message in the other communications medium is composed and sent using the address in the address field relating to the other communications medium of the  found entry (418).<br>
If such an entry is not found, then a new record is created (422).    The user is prompted for the destination  address  for the message  in the other communications  medium. The destination address is inserted into the address field for the other communications  medium, and the name field for the<br><br>
23 message communications  medium is  inserted  into the  name  field<br>
for the other communications medium (422).    Then a message in the other communications  medium is composed and sent using  the address in the address field relating to the other communications medium of the found entry (424).    The reply process  then ends (426),<br>
A communications device operating according  to  the present invention  permits  automatic replies in  any  communications medium to any received  message.<br><br>
