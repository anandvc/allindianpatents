The   compounds   prepared   in   the   examples   according   to   the   present invention   were   tested   for   pharmacological   activities   against   tumors. Antitumor activities of the compounds were tested in vitro against 5 kinds of human tumor cell lines and 2 kinds of leukemia tumor cell lines. Methods and results of the tests are as follows.<br>
Experimental 1 : In vitro antitumor effect against human tumor cell lines.<br>
A.	Tumor cell lines : A549 (human non-small lung cell)<br>
SKOV-3 (human ovariance HCT-15 (human coloncell<br>
XF-498 (human CNScell<br>
cell SKMEL-2 (human melanoma)<br>
cell<br>
B.	Method : SRB Assay<br>
a.	Human     solid     tumor    cell    lines,     A549(non-small    lung     cell),<br>
SKMEL-2(melanoma),       HCT-lS(colon),	SKOV-3(ovarian)       and<br>
XF-498(CNS) were cultured in 5%   CO2   incubators using the RPMI 1640<br>
media   containing   10%   FBS   at   37oC,   while   with   transfer-culturing<br>
successively once or twice per week. Cell cultures were dissolved in a<br>
solution of 0.25% trysin and 3 mmol CDTA PBS(-) to separate the cells<br>
sticked on the culture media. 5x10,-2x10 cells were added into each well of 96-well plate and<br>
cultured in 5% C02 incubator at 37 °C for 24 hours.<br>
c.	Each sample drug was dissolved in a little DMSO and diluted with the<br>
used medium to a prescribed concentration for experiment, while the final<br>
concentration of DMSO was adjusted below 0.5%.<br>
d.	Medium of each well cultured for 24 hours as above b. was removed<br>
by aspiration. Each 200µl of drug samples prepared in c. was added into<br>
each well and the wells were cultured for 48 hours. Tz(time zero) plates<br>
were collected at the point of time drugs were added.<br>
e. According to the 8KB assay method, cell fixing with TCA, staining with 0.4% SUB solution, washing with 1% acetic acid and elution of dye with l0mmol Tris solution were carried out on Tz plates and culture-ended plates, and then, OD values were measured at 520 nm.<br>
C. Calculation of result<br>
a.	Time zero(Tz) value was determined with measuring the SRB protein<br>
value at the point of time drugs were added.<br>
b.	Control   value(C)   was   determined   with   the   OD   value   of   an   well<br>
untreated with drug.<br>
c.	Drug-treated  test  value(T)   was   determined  with  the  OD   value  of<br>
drug-treated well.<br>
d.	Effects of drugs were estimated with growth stimulation, net growth<br>
inhibition and net killing calculated from Tz, C and T values.<br>
e.	If    T    ≥   Tz,    cellular    response    function    was    calculated    by<br>
l00x(T-Tz)/(C-Tz), and, if T   
shown in the next table 1.<br>

Experimental 3 ' in vivo antitumor effects against mouse leukemia P388 cells<br>
A.	Material of experiment<br>
BDF1 mice were used.<br>
B.	Method of experiment<br>
1)   Leukemia   P388   cells   being   transfer-cultured   successively   in  DBA/2 mouse, were grafted into each mouse of a group comprising 8 mice of 6<br>
week old BDF1 mouse with the dose of Ixl06cells/0.lml<br>
2)	Sample drugs were dissolved in PBS or suspended in 0.5% tween 80,<br>
and   then   injected  into   abdominal   cavity  of   mouse   at   each   prescribed<br>
concentration on days 1, 5, 9, respectively.<br>
3)	With   observation   everyday,   survival   times   of   tested   mice   were<br>
measured. Antitumor activities was determined in such a manner that the<br>
increasing ratio(T/C%) of average survival days of drug-treated groups<br>
compared with the control group was calculated using the mean survival<br>
times of each tested groups.<br>

Experimental 4. Acute toxicity test (LD50) :<br>
a) Method : Litchfield-Wilcoxon method.<br>
6-week-old ICR mice(male 30±2.0g) were fed freely with solid feed and<br>
water at room temperature, 23±oC and at humidity 60A5%. Sample drugs<br>
were injected into the abdominal cavities of mice. Each group comprised 6<br>
mice. Observed during 14 days, external appearances and life or death thereof were recorded, and also, visible lesions were observed from dead mice by dissection. LD50 value was calculated by Litchfield-wilcoxon<br>
method.<br>
b) Results<br>
As shown in the following table, the compounds according to the present<br>
invention are predominantly  safe in comparison with  cisplatin,  whereby<br>
much   problems   of   known   compounds   such   as   restriction   of   dosage,<br>
unfavorable side effects by toxicity, etc. may be overcome considerably.<br>
