Title of the invention<br>
SELF-WARMING RINSE CARE COMPOSITIONS<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai-400 020, State of Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification describes the nature of this invention (and the manner in which it is to be performed)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to self-warming rinse-out hair care compositions with improved rheology and conditioning properties.  More particularly, this invention relates to such compositions containing quaternary ammonium, amidoamine and silicone compounds.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
It is desirable to provide self-warming hair care compositions.  These rinse-out compositions, which are typically in anhydrous form, are first applied to the hair, and then contacted with water to generate heat and give a perception of warmth to the user.  The perception of warmth is desirable because it serves as a signal or cue to the user that the composition works, and provides warmth and relaxation.<br>
Alternatively, water could be applied to hair first and then the rinse-out compositions could be applied, or water and rinse-out compositions could be applied simultaneously to the hair.  All of these methods would generate heat.<br>
Known anhydrous self-warming rinse-out hair care compositions based on the use of glycol in anhydrous form, have deficiencies in rheology and conditioning capability. Hence there is a heed for self-warming rinse-out hair care compositions with improved rheology and conditioning properties.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Publications and products which relate to the field of the invention are as follows:<br>
The Product:  Lux Self-Warming Conditioner Treatment  -1998.<br>
Product Label from the Andrew Jergens Company, for the Biore Facial Musk - copyright 1998.  The Biore Self-Heating Mask is a facial mask which contains sodium silicoaluminate.  On contact with water, this mask heats up.<br>
U.S. 5,328,685 describes	a clear conditioning composition<br>
comprising an amidoamine	salt, said amidoamine salt<br>
comprising an amidoamine	compound of a specified formula<br>
that is neutralized with	a suitable acid.<br>
Srmmary of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to an anhydrous or substantially anhydrous self-warming rinse-out hair care composition which comprises:<br>
a)	at least one glycol;<br>
b)	at least one quaternary ammonium compound;<br>
c)	at least one amidoamine; and<br>
d)	at least one silicone.<br>
Compositions of the invention can take the form of<br>
 Conditioners, shampoos, or 2 in 1 products.<br>
The invention also relates to a method for deep conditioning the hair with self-warming and/or cleansing the hair with<br><br><br><br>
3<br><br>
self-warming, which comprises contacting the hair with a composition of the invention and with water.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for preparing a composition of the invention.<br>
Detailed Description of -the Invention<br>
As used herein wt% means % by weight of the total composition unless otherwise specified.  Degrees are in degrees Celsius unless otherwise specified.  "Substantially anhydrous" means less than about 2 wt%, or more preferably less than about 1 wt% of water.  "Self-warming" means that when a composition of the invention is contacted with water, heat is evolved and the resulting composition may rise in temperature.<br>
Compositions of the invention are anhydrous or substantially anhydrous rinse-off hair care compositions. Compositions of the invention comprise:<br>
a)	at least one glycol;<br>
b)	at least one quaternary ammonium compound;<br>
c)	at least one amidoamine; and<br>
d)	at least one silicone.<br>
More specifically, compositions of the invention can comprise:<br>
a)   from about 30% to about 95% glycol; b.)   from .about .1% :to "about  10% quaternary ammonium compound;<br><br><br><br><br>
4<br><br>
c)	from about 0.05% to about 5 % amidoamine; and<br>
d)	from about 0.05% to about 5% silicone.<br>
As noted above, the compositions of the invention are either anhydrous or substantially anhydrous.  The compositions of the invention generate heat upon coming into contact with water.  This heat is called the "heat of dissolution of glycol".  Since this heat is to be generated when the composition is being used by the consumer, water must be kept from the compositions of the invention until used by the consumer.  This is why the compositions of the invention are either anhydrous or substantially anhydrous.<br>
What follows is a description of the ingredients used in the compositions of the invention.<br>

8<br><br>
Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed<br><br>
that the compositions of the invention, function as conditioners, for example, because the amidoamine acts as a deposition aid for the silicone.  Again an important feature of the compositions of the invention is that they contain at least one  amidoamine and at least one silicone.<br>
Silicones<br>
The following list of silicones which may be used in compositions of the invention is meant to be illustrative and not limiting.  These silicones are as follows: a polyalkyl siloxane, a polyaryl siloxane or a polyalkylaryl siloxane.<br>
Mixtures of volatile silicones such as cyclotetrasiloxane, cyciopentasiloxane, or cyclohexasiloxane are useful. Mixtures of the non-volatile silicone compounds are also useful.  The<br>
so-called "rigid silicones", as described in U.S. Patent<br>
2-1 4,902,499, having a viscosity above 500,000 cs (mm s ) at 20C<br>
and a weight average molecular" weight of at least about 500,000, also are useful in compositions of the present invention.  A phenyltrimethicone also is useful as a non¬volatile silicone compound.  Also useful is a mixture of a low molecular weight silicone fluid and a higher molecular weight silicone gum.  Silicones which are useful in compositions of the invention are described in US  patent 5,656,280. Non-volatile silicones include siloxane or siloxane mixtures<br>
having a viscosity of greater than 1 0 centistokes {mm2s-1 )<br>
Non-limiting examples include dimethicone, dimethiconol, amodimethicones, phenyl trimethicone and silicone copolyols.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
9<br><br>
Any combination of silicones and amidoamines listed just above are preferred for use in compositions of the invention.<br>
Another important feature of the present invention is that the compositions have a viscosity in the range of from, about<br>
2 -1<br>
1,000 or 2,000 centistokes {mm s } to about 30,000 centistokes<br><br>
(mm2s-1), more preferably from about 5,000 centistokes (mm23-1}<br>
to about 18,000 centistokes (mm2s-1 )  This viscosity is<br>
achieved by using one or more of the quaternary ammonium " compounds described above.  Because the composition has the above described viscosities, its use with water, which activates the glycol dissolution system generates, heat, and causes the consumer to have the perception of warmth.<br>

In Tables 1 and 2:<br>
•	"Lux" is a modification of the Lux self-warming conditioner composition;<br>
•	"Cond. 1" is a bench-mark commmercial "extra body" conditioner, and<br>
•	"Cond. 2"   is a bench-mark commercial "extra moisturising" conditioner.<br>
The conditioning properties of the compositions were assessed by means of a wet combing test using an Instron device, which is a method well-known in the art.  The self-warming properties of the compositions were assessed by measuring the temperature rise.  The results are presented in Table 2.<br>

Compositions A and B have similar wet combing properties to the commercial extra-moisturising conditioner, and superior wet combing properties to all of the other compositions in Table 2, including the commercial extra-body conditioner. This improvement in conditioning is achieved without compromising the self-heating capabilities of the hair care composition.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
                                                                                      23<br><br>
