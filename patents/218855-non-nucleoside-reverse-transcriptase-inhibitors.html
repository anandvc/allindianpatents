Field of The Invention<br>
The field of the invention is enzyme inhibition, and particularly in vitro and in vivo inhibition of reverse transcriptases <br>
Background of The Invention<br>
Numerous treatments for HIV are known in the art, and among (rther pharmaceutically active compounds, reverse transcriptase inhibitors have provided significant therapeutic effect to many HIV infected patients. For example, Lamivudine (3TC) or Zidovudine (AZT) are relatively well tolerated antiretroviral drugs. However, numerous viral strains have recently emerged with marked resistance against these compounds. To overcome resistance to at least some degree, new nucleoside-type inhibitors may be administered (alone or in combination with other nucleoside-type inhibitors), and exemplary alternative drugs include Stavudine (d4T), Didanosine (ddl), Combivir (a combination of Lamivudine and Zidovudine), and Trizivir (a combination of 3TC, AZT, and Abacavir).<br>
Unfortunately, development of resistance against one nucleoside-type inhibitor may also be accompanied by resistance (to at least some degree) against another nucleoside-type inhibitor, frequently necessitating a switch to a different class of pharmaceutically active molecules. In such cases, a patient may receive a protease inhibitor {e.g.. sequinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, etc.), typically in combination with other anti retroviral agents. However, the relatively complex administration regimen of such combinations often proves an organizational and financial challenge to many patients, and compliance is frequently less than desirable.<br>
In a somewhat better tolerated combination therapy, nucleoside-type inhibitors may be combined with non-nucleoside-type inhibitors. Non-nucleoside-type inhibitors {e.g., Nevirapine, Delavirdine, Efavirenz) are a structurally relatively inhomogeneous group of compounds and are thought to bind in a non-nucleoside pocket of the reverse transcriptase, thereby significantly increasing antiviral efficacy where nucleoside-type inhibitors is employed. While use of non-nucleoside-type inhibitors seems to provide a promising new class of antiviral drugs, several disadvantages still remain. For example, the cost for currently known non-nucleoside-type inhibitors is relatively high, and a single mutation in the viral reverse transcriptase can induce a cross resistance against a wide class of non-nucleoside<br><br>
reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Moreover, there is only a limited number of non-nucleoside-type inhibitors available for treatment of an HIV infected patient.<br>
Thus, although various compositions and methods for inhibition of reverse transcriptase, and especially a reverse transcriptase from HIV are known in the art, all or almost all of them have one or more disadvantages. Moreover, the HIV virus has a relatively high frequency of mutation, which often leads to drug resistance to current treatments. Therefore, there is still a need to provide new compositions and methods for inhibition of reverse transcriptases.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to methods and compositions for inhibition of a reverse transcriptase wherein various carbonyl amide compounds act as inhibitory compounds of a reverse transcriptase.<br>
In one aspect of the inventive subject matter, a method of inhibiting a reverse transcriptase will include a step in which the reverse transcriptase is presented with a compound having the structure HET-L-C(Y)NRiR2, wherein HET compri.ses a 5 or 6 member ring heterocycle, Lisa linker in which at least two atoms form a contiguous chain, wherein one of the two atoms is covalently bound to H, and wherein another one of the two atoms is covalently bound to the carbonyl atom, Y is oxygen, sulfur, or NH, Rj is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, and methyl, or Ri forms a ring with R2 via a chain of between 1-5 atoms; and R2 is selected from the group consisting of a substituted or unsubstituted aryl, a cycloalkanyl, a cycloalkenyl, and a substituted or unsubstituted heterocycle.<br>
In particularly preferred methods, HET is a substituted triazole or imidazole, and it is even more preferred that the substituted triazole or imidazole is substituted with a first substituent (e.g., methyl) and a second substituent {e.g., toluyl), wherein at least one of the first and second substituents includes an aryl group. Moreover, it is generally preferred that L is -X1-CR3R4-, wherein Xi is selected from the group consisting of S, O, S(0), S(0)2, NH, NR3 and CR3R4; and wherein R3 and R4 are independently hydrogen, halogen, lower alkyl, lower cycloalkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, NH?, OH, and SH. In still further preferred aspects, L is selected from the group consisting of-S-CHa-, -S(0)-CH2-, -S(0)2-CH2-, -O-CH2-, NHCH2, N(Me)CH2 and -CH2-CH2-. and/or Y is O. In still further prefen-ed<br><br>
compounds of such methods, Ri is hydrogen and R2 is a substituted aryl or heteroarvl, and more preferably R2 comprises an ortho-substituted phenyl in which the substituent is a halogen or methyl.<br>
Especially contemplated methods include those in which the reverse transcriptase is an HIV reverse transcriptase, and most preferably in which the HIV reverse transcriptase is resistant to a non-nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Contemplated methods may be performed in vivo and/or in vitro, and may further include a step in which a compound is converted to a prodrug, and/or a step in which the reverse transcriptase is presented with a second inhibitor {e.g., non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor).<br>
Therefore, it is contemplated that a method of treating an HIV infected patient may comprise a step in which a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound according to Structure 1 is administered to a patient at a dosage effective to reduce viral propagation, wherein Structure I is HET-L-C(Y)NRiR2, and wherein HET comprises a heterocycle, L is a linker in which at least two atoms form a contiguous chain, wherein one of the two atoms is covalently bound to HET, and wherein another one of the two atoms is covalently bound to the carbonyl atom, Y is oxygen, sulfur, or NH, R) is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, and methyl, or Rj forms a ring with R2 via a chain of between 1-5 atoms, and R2 is selected fi-om the group consisting of a substituted or unsubstituted aryl, a cycloalkanyl, a cycloalkenyl, and a substituted or unsubstituted heterocycle. With respect to particularly preferred substituents, the same considerations as described above apply.<br>
Consequently, it is contemplated that a pharmaceutical composition will include a compound of the structure HET-L-C(Y)NRiR2 (with substituents as described above) wherein the compound is present in a concentration effective to inhibit a reverse transcriptase in a cell of a patient when administered to the patient.<br>

In still other aspects of the inventive subject matter, a compound has a general structure of HET-W-C(Ri)(R2)-C(Y)-N(R4R5), wherein HET comprises a nitrogen-containing substituted heterocycle other than a triazole, W is O, S, S(0), S(0)2, NH.

Contemplated Compounds<br>
The inventors generally contemplate that all compounds of Formula (I) are suitable for use herein:<br>
HET-L-C(Y)NR,R2    (1)<br>
wherein HET comprises a substituted or unsubstituted heterocycle. which may or may not be aromatic; Lisa linker in which at least two atoms form a contiguous chain, wherein one of the two atoms is covalently bound to the heterocycle, and wherein another one of the two atoms is covalently bound to the carbonyl carbon atom; Y is O, S, or NR3; Ri and R3 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, and optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl (preferably lower alkyl); and R2 is selected from the group consisting of a substituted or unsubstituted aryl, a cycloalkyl, a cycloalkenyl, and a substituted or unsubstituted heterocycle (which may include one or more double bonds, and which may further be aromatic).<br>
With respect to the heterocycle it is preferred that at least one, and more typically at least two of the heteroatoms are nitrogen, and that the two heteroatoms are connected to each other in the heterocycle via a covalent bond. Consequently, particularly suitable heterocycles include a triazole (most preferably a ! ,2,4-triazole) or imidazole ring system. In alternative aspects, however, suitable heterocycles may also include 5-, and 6-membered rings with at least one heteroatom (e.g., O, N, or S), wherein such rings may further be coupled or fused to at least one other ring (which may or may not include a heteroatom).<br>
Particularly preferred heterocycles further include at least one, and even more preferably at least two substituents, wherein suitable substituents independently include a substituted and/or an unsubstituted aryl, a substituted and/or an unsubstituted alkyl, a<br><br>
substituteu anu/or an unsuosxuuiea aiKenyi, a suDsliluted and/or an unsubstituted alkynyi. wherein each of the two substituents may further include one or more heteroatoms. However, in even more preferred aspects, contemplated heterocycles will include a lower alkyl (and most preferably a methyl, a halogen atom or trifluoromethyl) as one substituent and a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl (e.g., haiogenated or toluyl) or a substituted or unsubstituted quinoline as the other substituent.<br>
Consequently, particularly preferred heterocycles will have a structure according to Formula (11)<br><br>
'/    \\ 1     "N^<br>
X-N<br>
R,<br>
R<br><br>
(If)<br>
wherein Ri and R2 are independently hydrogen, halogen, lower alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyi, aryl, heteroaryl, alkaryl (all of which may be substituted), OH, SH, NO2, NR1R2 (with Ri and R2 as defined immediately above), CF3, N3, and/or an O-alkyI, and X is N or CRt (with R| as defined immediately above).<br>
In further contemplated aspects, it should be recognized that the structure and chemical nature of suitable linkers may vary substantially. For example, where it is desired that the linker has a relatively rigid character {e.g., at least one, and more typically two degrees of rotational freedom are restricted), suitable linkers may include a double and/or triple bond, or include one or more atoms in a planar configuration (e.g., aromatic, conjugated, or carbonyl structure). On the other hand, where it is desirable that the linker has flexibility to at least some degree, suitable linkers may include an alkyl group, or an oxygen or sulfur atom. Thus, suitable linkers may also include various heteroatoms, and particularly preferred heteroatoms are oxygen and sulfur (in various oxidation states).<br>
Consequently, contemplated linkers include particularly those in which at least two atoms form a contiguous chain (via a covalent bond), wherein one of the two atoms is covalently bound to the heterocycle (preferably to a carbon atom of HET), and wherein another one of the two atoms is covalently bound to the carbonyl carbon atom of<br><br>
contemplated compounds. Thus, particularly preferred linkers will have a structure according to Formula (III)<br>
-X,-CR3R4-     (111)<br>
wherein Xi is a heteroatom. and most preferably S, S(0), S(0)2, O. or NRs wherein R5 is preferably hydrogen, or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl (most preferably lower alkyl). Alternatively, Xi may also include a carbon atom and may thus have the structure -(CR5R6)n-wherein n is between one and five, and wherein R3, R4, R5, and Re are independently hydrogen, halogen, lower alkyl. lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, NH2. OH, and/or SH. Therefore, suitable linkers will include those having the structure -S-CH2-, -S(0)-CH2-, -S(0)2-CH2-, -O-CH2-, -NHCH2, -N(CH3)CH2, and -CH2-CH2-.<br>
Moreover, it should be appreciated that the carbonyl carbon atom of Formula (I) may be covalently bound to various atoms/groups Y, and particularly suitable groups Y include those in which Y is O (to form a carboxamide), S (to form a thiocarboxamide), and NR (to form a carboxamidine), wherein R may be hydrogen, or a substituted or unsubstituted lower alkyl. Suitable alternative R include all those that will (form with N, or) provide a hydrogen bond donor or acceptor group. Consequently, Y of Formula (I) may be O, S, or NR, with R as defined above, especially including hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, or hydroxy, O-alkyl, or CH2OH.<br>
Similarly, and with further respect to compounds according to Formula (J), the nature of the substituents R] and R2 of the nitrogen atom that is covalently bound to the carbonyl carbon may vary considerably, and all known substituents of secondary amines are contemplated herein. Therefore, R] and R2 in Formula (1) may be independently hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted alkenyl, substituted or unsubstituted alkynyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, all of which may further include one or more heteroatoms. However, it is generally preferred that one of Ri and R2 is relatively small (e.g., hydrogen, methyl, tritluoromethyl, etc.), while the other of Ri and R2 comprises an aryl group. Especially preferred aryl groups will be substituted, most preferably in ortho-position, and may further include a substituent in para-position (e.g., ortho-substituted phenyl with halogen or methyl as substituent). Therefore, especially contemplated Ri will include a hydrogen and lower alkyl (which may be further substituted [e.g., trifuoromethyi]), while<br><br>
especially contemplated R2 include an arjl, a cycloalkyl, a cycloalkenyl, a heteroaiyl and a heterocycle.<br>
In one especially preferred aspect, the heterocycle is covalently bound to the linker via a group other than -S- or -0-, and the linker has a relatively short and relatively flexible structure of-W-C(Ri)(R2)-. Consequently, contemplated compounds will have a structure according to Formula (IV)<br>
HET-W-C(R,)(R2)-C(Y)-N(R4R5)     (IV)<br>
wherein HET is defined as in Formula (I) above, and wherein C(Y)-N(R4Rs) is defined as C(Y)-N(RiR2) in Formula (1) above. With respect to W, it is generally contemplated that all groups and/or atoms other than -S- and -O- are appropriate, and particularly preferred groups include S(0), S(0)2, NH, NRi and CH2. Particularly preferred Ri and R2 and relatively small radicals, and it is especially preferred that Ri and RT are independently lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl (all of which may be further substituted), hydrogen, halogen, OH, SH, NH2, N3, 0-alkyl, or CH2OH.<br>
Alternatively, where it is desired that the heterocycle is covalently bound to the linker via a -S-, -0-, or other group, and where the linker is relatively short and flexible, contemplated compounds may have a structure according to Formula (V)<br>
HET-W-C(R,)(R2)-C(Y)-N(R4R5)     (V)<br>
in which HET, R), R2, R4 and R5 are defined as in Formula (IV) above, and in which W and Y are defined as Formula (I) above with the exception that Y is not O.<br>
In a still further contemplated aspect, particularly preferred compounds include those in which the heterocyclic base is a disubstituted 1,2,4-triazole or a disubstituted imidazole, and suitable compounds may have a structure according to Formula (VI)<br>
HET-W-C(R,)(R2)-C(Y)-N(R4R5)     (VI)<br>
wherein HET comprises a disubstituted 1,2,4-triazole or a disubstituted imidazole, wherein at least one substituents of HET is a substituted aryl, and wherein the substituted aryl is covalently bound to a nitrogen of HET; wherein W is O, S, S(0), S(0)2, NH, NRi or CHo, wherein Y is defined as in Formula (I) above, and wherein Ri, R2, R4- and R5 are<br><br>
independently as defined above in Formula (IV). Thus, particularly preferred compounds will<br>
have a structure according to Formulae A or B<br><br><br><br>
wherein R] is lower alkyl (optionally substituted), halogen or CF3, R2 is optionaify substituted cycloalkyi, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted quinoline, or optionally substituted isoquinoline, and R3, R4, and R5 are independently hydrogen, halogen, optionally substituted alkyl.

R3 and R4 may be the same or different, or may even be linked together via a chain of two to four carbon atoms. Similarly, R5 may be the same as R3, but is more preferably different from R3. For example, R4 or R5 may independently have a structure as shown below:<br><br>

Thus, the ortho-substituted phenyl in the compounds according to Formulae A and B may further include at least one of a meta- and para-substituent {e.g.. as defined as R3 immediately above).<br>
In especially preferred compounds according to Formulae A or B, R2 is selected from the group consisting of a monosubstituted phenyl, a disubstituted phenyl, a trisubstituted phenyl, a monosubstituted naphthyl, a disubstituted naphthyl, a trisubstituted naphthyl, a monosubstituted quinoline, a disubstituted quinoline, a trisubstituted quinoline, a monosubstituted isoquinoline. a disubstituted isoquinoline, and a trisubstituted isoquinoline.<br><br>
Most preferably, the substituent(s) of the substituted ar&gt;l is an optionally substituted lower alkyl, CF3, a lower alkoxy, a halogen, or "NR'R", wherein R' and R" are independently H or lower alkyl.<br>
Moreover, it should still further be recognized that in contemplated compounds the carboxamide group -C(Y)-NRiR2 may be replaced with an o.xazole moiety. Such replacement may be advantageous to increase one or more phannacokinetic/d\namic properties, and is thought to retaining the overall stereochemical configurations at least with respect to the atoms/groups interacting with the reverse transcriptase. Bioisosteric replacement approaches are described in George A. Patani and Edmond J. LaVoie. Bioisosterism; A rational approach in drug design, Chem. Rev. 1996, 96, 3147-3176, or in Preben H. Olsen, The use of bioisosteric groups in lead optimization. Curreni Opinion in Drug Discovery &amp; Development 200], 4, 471-478, both incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Synthesis and modification of various oxazoles is described in Toshikazu Ibata and Yasushi Isogami, Formation and reaction of oxazoles. Synthesis of A'-substituted 2-(aminomethyl)oxazoles, Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn 1989, 62, 618-620, or in Toshikazu Ibata and Ryohei Sato, The acid catalyzed decomposition of diazo compounds. 1. Synthesis of oxazoles in the BF3 catalyzed reaction of diazo carbonyl compounds with nitriles, Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn 1979, 52, 3597-3600, and these and other references known in the art may be employed to provide some guidance for preparation of contemplated compounds in which the carboxamide group has been replaced with an oxazole moiety.<br>
Synthesis of Contemplated Compounds<br>
It should be particularly appreciated that some of the contemplated compounds are commercially available from various sources, and all of the commercially available compounds are contemplated suitable for use herein. However, numerous of the contemplated compounds are not commercially available, and synthesis of some of those compounds may be performed following a protocol substantially as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,939,462, which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
It should be recognized, however, that numerous alternative synthetic routes for the preparation contemplated compounds are also considered and the following exemplary routes are provided for guidance of a practitioner of ordinary skill in the art. For example, in one synthetic route, a suitably substituted amine {e.g., primary or secondary amine) is reacted<br><br>
with activated carbonyl containing compounds (preferably a carbonyl halide). wherein the carbonyl containing compound further includes a leaving group (and most preferably bromine). After formation of the carbonyl amide, the reaction product is reacted with a nucleophilic group (e.g., OH, SH, orNRiR? with Ri and R2 independently hydrogen alkyl. etc. as outlined for Formula (I) above) of a second reagent thereby replacing the leaving group to form the desired compound as depicted in Scheme 1 below.<br><br>

Scheme 1<br>
Ri and R2 of Scheme 1 may be any suitable substituent and is generally contemplated that appropriate R] and R2 independently include hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted alkenyl, substituted or unsubstituted alkynyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, all of which may further include one or more heteroatoms. However, it is generally preferred that one of Ri and R2 is relatively small (e.g., hydrogen, methyl, trifluoromethyl, etc.), while the other of Ri and R2 comprises an aryl group. Especially preferred aryl groups will be substituted, most preferably in ortho-position, and may further include a substituent in para-position (e.g., ortho-substituted phenyl with halogen or methyl as substituent). Therefore, especially contemplated Ri will include a hydrogen and lower alkyl (which may be further substituted), while R2 may be selected from the group consisting of an aryl, a heteroaryl, a cycloalkyl, a cycloalkenyl. and a heterocycle.<br>
Similarly, it is contemplated that the choice of leaving groups Li and L2 will depend at least to some extent up on the particular choice of the amine and/or HET-XH, and all suitable leaving groups are contemplated. However, it is particularly preferred that Li and L2 are a halide, and most preferably a bromide. Alternatively, Lj may also be OH or O-Acyl. With respect to R3 and R4 the same considerations as described above for R3 and R4 in<br><br>
Formula (III). Y may be O, S, or NR with R as defined above. X in HET-XH is typically a heteroatom or CH2, and most preferably S, S(0), S(0)2, or O. HET may be any heterocycle, and particularly suitable heterocycles include those described aboye. Suitable solvents include ethers, alcohols, and hydrocarbons (optionally halogenated) and the choice of suitable solvents will at least in part depend on the chemical nature of the particular reagent. Furthermore with respect to the catalyst and/or base employed in the above reaction, the same considerations as those described by Connell et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,939.462) appK.<br><br>
Alternatively, synthesis may follow a general protocol as outlined in Scheme 2. in which contemplated compounds are prepared from two separately prepared precursors. The first precursor comprising a substituted heterocycle may be prepared following a protocol similar to the protocols given below in the section entitled "Examples". Similarly, the second precursor comprising a substituted aryl may be prepared following a protocol similar to the protocols given below in the section entitled "Examples". Fusion of the so prepared precursors is typically carried out in DMF with potassium carbonate.<br>

In still further contemplated aspects, and especially where contemplated compounds include an acid or a basic group, it should be appreciated that the corresponding salt (and preferably a pharmacologically acceptable salt) may be formed. For example, where<br><br>
contemplated compounds include a basic group, an acid addition salt may be prepared. Acid addition salts of such basic compounds can be prepared in a standard manner in a suitable solvent from the compound and an excess of acid, including hydrochloric, hydrobromic. sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, maleic, succinic, or methanesulfonic acid. Likewise, if contemplated compounds include an acidic group, alkaline addition salts may be prepared (e.g., by treatment of the acidic compound with an excess of an alkaline reagent, such as hydroxide, carbonate or alkoxide. containing an appropriate cation. Suitable cations include Na"", K^ Ca^^, or NH/).<br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions comprising Contemplated Compounds<br>
Where contemplated compounds are administered in a pharmacological composition, it is contemplated that suitable compounds can be formulated in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. For example, contemplated compounds can be administered orally as pharmacologically acceptable salts (see above), or intravenously in physiological saline solution (e.g., buffered to a pH of about 7.2 to 7.5). Conventional buffers such as phosphates, bicarbonates or citrates can be used for this purpose. Of course, one of ordinary skill in the art may modiiy the formulations within the teachings of the specification to provide numerous formulations for a particular route of administration. In particular, contemplated compounds may be modified to render them more soluble in water or other vehicle, which for example, may be easily accomplished by minor modifications (salt formulation, esterification, etc.) that are well within the ordinary skill in the art. It is also well within the ordinary skill of the art to modify the route of administration and dosage regimen of a particular compound in order to manage the pharmacokinetics of the present compounds for maximum beneficial effect in a patient.<br>
In certain pharmaceutical dosage forms, prodrug forms of contemplated compounds may be formed for various purposes, including reduction of toxicity, increasing the organ- or target cell specificity, etc. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize how to readily modify the present compounds to pro-drug forms to facilitate delivery of active compounds to a target site within the host organism or patient (see above). One of ordinary skill in the art will also take advantage of favorable pharmacokinetic parameters of the pro-drug forms, where applicable, in delivering the present compounds to a targeted site within the host organism or patient to maximize the intended effect of the compound.<br><br>
In addition, contemplated compounds may be administered alone or in combination with other agents for the treatment of HIV, and particularly contemplated additional compounds include nucleoside-type reverse transcriptase inhibitors {e.g., Lamivudine. Zidovudine, Stavudine, Abacavir, Tenofovir or Didanosine ), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g., Nevirapine, Delavirdine, Efavirenz). protease inhibitors {e.g., Sequinavir, Indinavir. Nelfinavir), a fusion inhibitor {e.g.. Enfuvirtide), a CCR5 antagonist, immunotherapeutic agents {e.g.. ribavirin, IL-2). an active, passive, and/or therapeutic vaccine. Combination therapies according to the present invention comprise the administration of at least one compound of the present invention or a functional derivative thereof and at least one other pharmaceutical ly active ingredient. The active ingredient(s) and pharmaceutically active agents may be administered separately or together and when administered separately this may occur simultaneously or separately in any order. The amounts of the active ingredient(s) and pharmaceutically active agent(s) and the relative timings of administration will be selected in order to achieve the desired combined therapeutic effect.<br>
Therefore, the inventors contemplate that a pharmaceutical composition may comprise a compound of structure HET-L-C(Y)NRiR2, wherein HET comprises a preferably substituted heterocycle, Lisa linker in which at least two atoms form a contiguous chain, wherein one of the two atoms is covalently bound to the heterocycle, and wherein another one of the two atoms is covalently bound to the carbonyl atom, Y is O, S, or NR3, R] and R3 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, and lower alkyl, RT is selected from the group consisting of a substituted or unsubstituted aryl, a cycloalkanyl, a cycloalkenyl, and a substituted or unsubstituted heterocycle, and wherein the compound is present in a concentration effective to inhibit a reverse transcriptase and/or HIV replication in a cell of a patient when administered to the patient.<br>
With respect to suitable concentrations of contemplated compounds in pharmaceutical compositions, it should be appreciated that a person of ordinary skill in the art will readily adjust the amount of the compound to achieve inhibition of the reverse transcriptase and/or HIV replication. For example, inhibition of the HIV replication in a cell (typically a T-cell infected with the HIV virus) may be monitored in vitro using a blood culture and a luciferase based assay system as described below. Alternatively, inhibition of the reverse transcriptase may be monitored in vivo using RT-PCR to detenninc the amount of copies of viral DNA<br><br>
and/or RNA in blood or lymph nodes (containing HIV infected cells). However, it is generally contemplated that suitable concentrations will achieve a serum concentration of between 1 nM (in some cases even between 0.01 nM and 1 nM) and 100 microM.<br>
In particularly preferred compounds, HET is a substituted triazole or imidazole, and it is even more preferred that the substituted triazole or imidazole is substituted with a first substituent (e.g., methyl, CF3 or halogen) and a second substituent (e.g.. toiuyl. naphthyi, or quinoline), and wherein at least one of the first and second substituents includes a substituted phenyl group. Furthermore, it is generally preferred that the linker L has the structure -Xi-CR3R4-, wherein Xi is selected from the group consisting of CH2, S, O, S(0), S(0)2, NH, NR3 and CR3R4, and wherein R3 and R4 are independently hydrogen, halogen, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, NH2, OH, and SH. Thus, especially preferred linkers include those in which L is -S-CH2-, -S(0)-CH2-, -S(0)2-CH2-, -O-CH2-, -NH-CH2, -N(Me)-CH2 or -CH2-CH2-. Moreover, particularly suitable substituents for the nitrogen atom Ri and R2 include hydrogen and a substituted aryl, respectively, and an especially preferred R2 is an ortho-substituted phenyl (wherein the ortho-substituent is a halogen, a CF3 or a methyl).<br>
Consequently, particularly preferred pharmaceutical compositions will include contemplated compounds according to Structures A or B below:<br><br><br>
N-N<br>
'/    A-<br>
N<br>
I<br>
R2<br><br>
O<br><br><br>
(A)	(B)<br>
wherein Ri is optionally substituted lower alkyi, CF3, halogen, or hydrogen, wherein R2 is cycloalkyi, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstiluted heterocycle, and R3 is lower alkyl or halogen.<br>
In yet another aspect of the inventive subject matter, it should be recognized that contemplated compounds may be employed as a pharmaceutical product for treatment of a viral (and especially retroviral) infection in a mammal (typically human). Therefore, it is contemplated that suitable pharmaceutical products will include contemplated compounds, and an instruction to administer the compound to a patient infected with a retrovirus under a protocol that reduces viral propagation of the retrovirus. For example, the compounds may be<br><br>
provided in dosages for oral or parenteral administration {infra), while suitable instructions to administer the compound will typically include a package insert or a prescription information. Alternatively, contemplated instructions may also include specific treatment schedules adapted to a particular treatment regimen {e.g., where contemplated compounds are co-administered in a combination therapy) or a sales brochure or other advertising publication. Protocols contemplated herein include all known forms of administrations to reduce the viral titer in the patient or to even eliminate the virus from the patient entireK.<br>
Contemplated Methods of Use<br>
The inventors surprisingly discovered (for experiments and data see below in the section with the title "Examples") that contemplated compounds exhibit significant in vitro and/or in vivo inhibitory effect on a reverse transcriptase, and especially on the reverse transcriptase of the HIV virus.<br>
Consequently, the inventors contemplate a method of inhibiting a reverse transcriptase in which a reverse transcriptase is presented with a compound according to Formula (I)<br>
HET-L-C(Y)NR,R2    (1)<br>
wherein HBT comprises a preferably substituted heterocycie; L is a linker in which at least two atoms form a contiguous chain, wherein one of the two atoms is covalently bound to the heterocycie, and wherein another one of the two atoms is covalently bound to the carbonyl carbon atom: Y is O, S, or NR3; Ri and R3 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, and optionally substituted lower alkyl; and R2 is selected from the group consisting of a substituted or unsubstituted aryl, a cycloalkyi, a cycloalkenyl. and a substituted or unsubstituted heterocycie.<br>
In particularly preferred aspects of contemplated methods, the heterocycie comprises a nitrogen-containing heterocycie, and is most preferably substituted triazole or imidazole. While the substituent or substituents on contemplated heterocycles may vary considerably, it is generally preferred that the substituted triazole or imidazole will include a first and second substituent, wherein the first substituent is relatively small {e.g., methyl, trifluoromethyl, nitro, amino, halogen, hydroxy, orthio group) and wherein the second substituent includes an aromatic system (and most preferably a substituted naphthyl, substituted phenyl or substituted<br><br>
quinoline). With respect to the aromatic system, the inventors discovered thai where the aromatic system comprises a phenyl group, particularly strong inhibition could be achieved where the phenyl group has a substituent in the ortho-position. The same observations were made for compounds having a naphthyl group or a quinoline group.<br>
Furthermore, it is contemplated that the nature and particular structure of the linker connecting the heterocycle to the carbonyl carbon may var\ considerably, and it is generaih contemplated that the linker may allow steric flexibility or may orient the heterocycle in a relatively fixed position relative to the carbonyl group. For example, where the linker is relatively flexible, it is contemplated that all of covalent bonds between the atoms that form a contiguous chain to connect the heterocycle with the carbonyl carbon are single bonds. Of course, it should be recognized that the bond angle between such atoms will depend at least to some degree on the chemical nature of the atoms. Therefore, relatively straight angles (e.g., where the atom is O or S) are contemplated as well as non-straight angles (e.g., where the atom is C or P).<br>
On the other hand, where the linker is relatively rigid, suitable linkers may include two or more atoms (within the contiguous chain of atoms that connect the heterocycle with the carbonyl carbon) that are covalently coupled to each other via a double or triple bond. Such linkers may therefore include unsaturated straight or branched hydrocarbons chains, or aromatic rings. Alternatively, contemplated linkers may also include cycloalkyl groups. Moreover, suitable linkers may further include various functional groups to provide particular physicochemica! properties, including a hydrogen bond donor or acceptor group, a polar or non-polar group, an ionic group, or a lipophilic group. Thus, suitable linkers may include between 2 and 20 (and even more) atoms, which may or may not include heteroatoms.<br>
Consequently, particularly preferred linkers may have the structure -X1-CR3R4-, wherein Xi is selected from the group consisting of S, O, S(0), S(0)2, NH, NR3 and CR3R4, and wherein R3 and R4 are independently hydrogen, halogen, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, NH2, OH, and SH. Even more preferred linkers will include those selected from the group of-S-CH2-, -S(0)-CH2-, -S(0)2-CH2-, -O-CH2-, -NH-CH2-, -N(Me)CH2-and -CH2-CH2-.<br>
In yet further aspects of preferred methods, the carbonyl carbon may be covalently bound to an oxygen, sulfur, or a NH or NR group, wherein R may be selected from the group<br><br>
consisting of hydrogen, halogen, and lower alkyl. Consequently, contemplated compounds may include a carboxamide group, a (substituted) carboxamidine group, or a thiocarboxamide group.<br>
In still further aspects of preferred methods, Ri and R2 may vary considerably, and all Ri and R2 groups contemplated above in the section entitled "Contemplated Compounds" are considered suitable for use herein. However, it is generally preferred that R. is hydrogen and R2 is a substituted aryl (and most preferably that Ri comprises an ortho-substituted phenyl, wherein the ortho-substituent is a halogen, a SCH3. a CF3 or a methyl).<br>
It should further be appreciated that contemplated methods of inhibition of a reverse transcriptase need not be limited to a particular reverse transcriptase, and it should be recognized that all known reverse transcriptases are considered suitable for use herein. However, it is particularly preferred that the reverse transcriptase is a viral reverse transcriptase, and in especially preferred aspects the viral reverse transcriptase is from HIV. Moreover, the inventors discovered that such reverse transcriptases may be inhibited even when the reverse transcriptase is at least partially resistant to a non-nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor. The term "at least partially resistant to a non-nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor" as used herein means that the 'at least partially resistant' reverse transcriptase is inhibited by previously known non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors to a lesser degree than a non-resistant reverse transcriptase (see section with the title "Examples").<br>
With respect to the step of presenting the reverse transcriptase, it is contemplated that all manners of presentation are suitable and include numerous in vitro and in vivo presentations. For example, where presentation of the reverse transcriptase with contemplated compounds is in vitro, it should be appreciated that the reverse transcriptase may be in a solvent or supported on a solid phase (and optionally in the presence of an RNA or DMA template, cofactors, and nucleotides, etc.). Contemplated solvents include those that are predefined {e.g., reverse transcriptase buffer) as well as those where the exact chemical composition is highly complex {e.g., cell lysate). Suitable solid phases include gels, polymer beads, walls of a microplate, etc. Furthermore, particularly contemplated in vitro presentation also includes a presentation where the reverse transcriptase is enclosed by a cell (infected by the HIV virus, or transfected and transformed to produce recombinant reverse transcriptase), and wherein the cell is in an environment that inrliiHp
 <br>
Thus, in vitro presentation includes all manners of presentation in which the reverse transcriptase is in the same environment as contemplated compounds. Consequently, contemplated compounds may be added to a buffer, medium, or other solvent in which the reverse transcriptase is present, and addition of contemplated compounds includes addition in dissolved form as well as in solid form. With respect to the particular form (f.^., as solution in a particular solvent) in which contemplated compounds are added to the environment a person of ordinary skill in the art will readily determine a suitable form. Similarly, the appropriate concentration may readily be determined by a person of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation (e.g., using IC50 data as guidance).<br>
Similarly, contemplated in vivo presentations include all manners of adding contemplated compounds in a suitable formulation to an environment that contains the reverse transcriptase, and especially contemplated environments include mammals infected with a retrovirus, and most preferably the HIV virus. Consequently, particularly preferred in vivo presentations include administration of pharmaceutical compositions comprising contemplated compounds to a patient that is infected with the HIV virus. Thus, suitable administration may be oral and/or parenteral (systemic) administration as well as ex vivo administration to whole blood or components thereof with reintroduction of at least a portion of the whole blood or components thereof Exemplary pharmaceutical compositions are described above in the section with the title "Pharmaceutical Compositions comprising Contemplated Compound".<br>
Therefore, the inventors contemplate a method of treating an HIV infected patient in which a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound according to Formula (I) is administered to the patient at a dosage effective to reduce viral propagation, wherein Formula (I) is HE r-L-C(Y)NRiR2, in which HET comprises a preferably substituted heterocycle, L is a linker in which at least two atoms form a contiguous chain, wherein one of the two atoms is covalently bound to the heterocycle, and wherein another one of the two atoms is covalently bound to the carbonyl atom, Y is oxygen, sulfur, NH, or NR (with R as described above), Ri is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, and methyl, and R2 is selected from the group consisting of a substituted or unsubstituted aryl, a cycloalkanyl, a cycloaikenyl, and a substituted or unsubstituted heterocycle. With respect to particularly preferred structures, the same considerations as described above in the section entitled "Contemplated Compounds" apply.<br><br>
Therefore, particularly preferred compounds for treatment of an HIV infected patient include those in which HET is a substituted triazole or imidazole, and/or L is selected from the group consisting of-S-CH.-, -S(0)-CH2-, -S(0)2-CH2-. -O-CHj-, -NH-CH2-, -N(Me)CH2- and -CH2-CH2-, and in which Y is oxygen. In still further preferred compounds for treatment methods, Ri is hydrogen and R2 is a substituted ar) 1. Thus, particularly preferred compounds for treatment of an HIV infection include compounds of structures A or B<br>

wherein Ri is lower alkyl, halogen or CF3, R2 is cycloalkyl, substituted aryl, or unsubstituted aryl, substituted quinoline or unsubstituted quinoline and Rj is lower alkyl, S-alkyl, CF3 or halogen. With respect to the dosage, it is contemplated that the dosage will predominantly depend on the particular compound employed {e.g., particular solubility, efficacy, bioavailability and/or metabolic profile), and it should be recognized that a person of ordinary skill in the art will readily be able to determine the proper dosage or dosage range. Similarly, reduction of viral propagation may be monitored using various methods well known in the art. For example, viral propagation may be measured using quantitative RT-PCR to determine the number of viral copies in a particular biological sample (e.g., whole blood).<br>
Of course, it should be recognized that, where desirable, contemplated compounds may be converted into a prodrug form to increase specificity towards an infected cell, to reduce adverse activity in non-infected cells, to increase bioavailability, etc., and suitable administration formulations, routes, and protocols are well known in the art (see also above). Exemplary suitable protocols for conversion of contemplated compounds into the corresponding prodrug form can be found in Francisca Lopez, Rui Moreira and Jim I ley, Acyloxymethyl as a drug protecting group.

Test System for Determination of Inhibition of HIV-1 Reverse Transcriptase<br>
Contemplated compounds were screened for inhibitory activity against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HFV-l) using a high throughput cell-based assay using HIV-1 expressing firefly luciferase as a reporter gene and pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus envelope glycoprotein (VSV-G). Experimental procedures were essentially as described by Connor et al. in Journal of Virology (1996), 70: 5306-5311 (Characterization of the functional properties ofenv genes from long-term survivors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection), and Popik et al. in Journal of Virology (2002), 76: 4709-4722 (Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 uses lipid raft-colocalized CD4 and chemokine receptors for productive entry into CD4"^ T cells). It should be particularly appreciated that the virus contains two introduced mutations in the RT gene (K103N and Y181C, created by PCR mutagenesis) that render the virus highly resistant to current non-nucleoside HIV-1 drugs. Virus stocks were generated by cotransfection of plasmid DNA encoding VSV-G with vector pNL4-3Env(-)Luc(+) into 293T cells. Sixt&gt;'-four hours after transfection, virus-containing medium was collected by centrifugation and stored frozen at -80 C.<br>
HeLa cells were infected with the VSV-G pseudotyped virus in the presence of screening compounds in a 384-well microtiter plate format. Forty-eight hours after initial infection, lysis buffer and Luciferase Assay Reagent (Promega) was added to the cells and luciferase activity was determined by counting the resultant luminescence using a LJL<br><br>
luminometer. Since the luciferase gene is carried in the virus genome, its expression level directly reflects the virus replication level in the presence of a compound.<br>
To evaluate the activity of the compounds against wild type HIV-1, the HeLa-JC53 cell line that expresses high levels of CD4 and CCR5 (see e.g., Piatt et al. in Journal of Virology (1998), 72: 2855-2864: Effect of CCR5 and CD4 cell surface concentrations on infection by macrophagetropic isolates of human immunodeficiency virus t\pe 1) was modified by isolation of a stable cell line that expresses luciferase under the control of the HIV-1 promoter (long terminal repeat, i.e.. LTR). HiV-l infection of this cell line stimulates the transcription of luciferase from the HlV-1 promoter and the luciferase gene expression level is proportional to the level of virus replication (Harrington et al. in Journal of Virology Methods (2000), 88: 111-115: Direct detection of infection of HIV-1 in blood using a centrifugation-indicator cell assay; and Roos et al. in Virology (2000), 273: 307-315: LuSIV cells: a reporter cell line for the detection and quantitation of a single cycle of HIV and SIV replication). Procedures for virus infection, compound testing and luciferase activity determination were the same as for the VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1.<br>
Two approaches were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the positive compounds discovered in the HlV-1 virus assays. The first approach employed another modified HeLa-JC53 cell line that constitutively expresses high level of luciferase without virus infection. The level of luciferase expression in these cells served as an indicator for cell replication in the presence of the compounds. Procedures for compound testing and luciferase activity determination were the same as for the virus infection tests. The other toxicitj' assay utilized HeLe-JC53 cells and a commercially available MTS assay kit (Promega) that measures the mitochondria function of the cells.<br>
