This invention relates to a method of controlling a texturing machine and a texturing machine.<br>
A method of this kind as well as a texturing machine are known from WO 98/033963.<br>
Texturing machines of this kind comprise a plurality of processing stations — normally as many as 216 or more processing stations ~ which are arranged side by side on one longitudinal side of the machine. Each of the processing stations comprises a plurality of processing units, which perform each a process step for advancing, texturing, drawing, and winding a yam to a package. The processing units and, thus, the process steps in the individual processing stations are monitored and controlled via a central machine control unit. For the operation, the control unit normally comprises an operator-controllable visual display unit, which permits visualizing and changing control and monitoring data. However, it is also common to use two separate visual display units respectively for controlling and monitoring the process. To be able to intervene in processing steps, a plurality of process controllers are provided, which are all connected to <br><br>
the central machine control unit.  It is possible to connect the process controllers to the processing units in two ways.  As disclosed in WO 98/033963, it is possible to operate the processing units within a processing station by individual drives with associated controllers, so that a plurality of process controllers are associated to each processing station.  In this instance, all process controllers connect to a central' machine control unit.<br>
In a second variant, which is known, for example, from DE 33 24 243, processing units of the same funccion in all processing stations are operated by a central drive, so that all processing units of the same function can be controlled by one process controller.  In this variant, the expenditure for the control system is considerably reduced in comparison with the foregoing variant with individual drives, however, with the disadvantage that all processing stations of the texturing machine must be operated synchronously.<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention co provide a method of controlling a texturing machine for false twist texturing a plurality of synthetic filament yarns in a corresponding plurality of processing stations as well as such a texturing machine, wherein a high flexibility is accomplished in the processing of the yarns with a simultaneously little expenditure for the control system.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of controlling a texturing machine for false twist texturing a plurality of synthetic filament yams and which comprises a plurality of adjacent processing stations of like construction, comprising the steps of dividing the plurality of processing stations into a plurality of sections, with each section comprising a plurality of processing stations, and monitoring and controlling the processing stations of each of the sections independently of the processing stations of adjacent sections.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a texturing machine for false twist texturing a plurality of synthetic filament yams by the method such as herein described, comprising a plurality of processing stations, with each processing station comprising a plurality of processing units for respectively advancing, texturing, drawing, and winding an advancing yam, a plurality of process controllers which are associated with the processing units of the processing stations, and wherein the plurality of processing stations are divided into a plurality of sections, with each section comprising a plurality of processing stations, and a plurality of field control units associated with respective ones of the sections for controlling and monitoring the processing stations of the associated section, and wherein the process controllers of the processing stations of each section are connected to the associated field control unit.<br><br>
To operate the texturing machine, the field control units connect independently of one another to a microprocessor, so that an operator is able to display the data of one of more field control units, or to input or change data on an operator-controllable visual display unit.<br>
To increase the efficiency of a texturing machine, it is further proposed to adapt, the microprocessor for being coupled via a line data network to a diagnosis station, thereby enabling a fast intervention by a central station upon occurrence of a defect.<br>
To transmit data between Che field control unit and the process controllers, as well as between the process controllers and the field control unit, it is advantageous to provide a serial bus system.  With that, it is possible to perform fast adjustment changes.<br>
Based on different requirements of individual process steps, the amount and frequency of the data exchange between the processing units and the field control unit are different.  To this end, the bus system may advantageously consist o.f a plurality of data networks, which have different data transmission races.<br>
To be able to make individual adjustment changes in the process steps of the processing stations, an advantageous further development of the texturing machine according to the invention provides for associating an individual one of the process controllers to each of the processing units of the processing stations pertaining to one section.<br><br>
within the processing stations, which contain<br>
no major changes, the process steps may advantageously<br>
be realized in accordance  with the further development<br>
present invention. of the/' In, this instance, Che processing units of<br>
the processing stations of a section are divided into<br>
groups of the same function, and an individual process<br>
controller is associated to each group of processing<br>
units.<br>
To maintain the flexibility in the processing<br>
of yarns despite combining individual process ?teps of<br>
adjacent processing stations to groups, a further<br>
development of the texturing machine according to the<br>
invention provides for associating a switch<br>
to at least one portion of the processing units, by<br>
which the processing units are switchably connected no<br>
one of the process controllers, the switch being<br>
activatable independently of the process controller.<br>
However, such a texturing machine is also<br>
suited by itself for  solving the problem underlying the<br>
present invention.  As a result of activating the<br>
processing units in groups, the switchable connection<br>
between the processing units and the process<br>
controllers permits individually activating with<br>
advantage each of the processing stations.  For<br>
example, when a yarn lap occurs in one feed system of a<br>
group of jointly controlled feed systems, it will be<br>
possible to shut down the affected feed system by the<br>
process controller, without influencing the adjacent<br>
feed systems in their activation.<br>
The switches provided between the processing<br>
units and the process controllers may advantageously be<br>
activated by the overriding field control unit.<br><br>
However, it is also possible to associate to the processing units a monitoring unit, which activates the switches in a case of need.<br>
To be able to shut down a processing unit fast and without major delay, when need arises, an advantageous further development provides for a sensor arrangement for monitoring at least one parameter of the processing unit.  The sensor arrangement connects to the monitoring unit associated to the processing unit or to the field control unit associated to the processing unit.  For example, it is possible to select as parameters the temperature of a motor, which a temperature sensor measures directly on the motor, or a desired rotational speed of a drive, which a speed sensor measures directly on a drive.  However, it is also possible to trigger the shutdown directly by a signal of the field control unit or monitoring unit, which occurs as a result of a signal from a yarn detector.<br>
Advantageously, the control functions and the monitoring functions are performed by an operator from an operator-controllable visual display unit, the latter being connected to the microprocessor.  However, it is also possible to perform the control functions and the monitoring functions from two separate visual display units,<br>
According to a preferred further development of the invention, the sections include each at least six processing stations, preferably twelve processing stations.<br>
In the following, both the method of the invention and some embodiments of the texturing machine according to the invention are described in greater<br><br>
detail with reference to the attached drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic side view of a first embodiment of a texturing machine according to the invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic top view of the embodiment of Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic view of a control system of a section of the texturing machine of Figures 1 and 2;<br>
Figure 4 is a schematic view of a further embodiment for activating a section of the texturing machine according to the invention; and<br>
Figures 5 and 6 are views of further embodiments for activating a section of the texturing machine according to the invention.<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic side view of a texturing machine according to the invention, and Figure 2 is a schematic top view of the texturing machine according to the invention.  Unless express reference is made to one of the Figures, the following description will apply to both Figures.<br>
The texturing machine consists of a creel frame 2, a process frame 3, and a takeup frame 1. Between the process frame 3 and the takeup frame 1, a service aisle 23 is formed.  On the side of the takeup frame 3 opposite to service aisle 23, the creel frame 2 is arranged at a distance from takeup frame 1.  With that, a doffing aisle 24 is formed between the takeup frame 1 and creel frame 2.<br>
In the longitudinal direction, the texturing machine comprises a plurality of processing stations 25.  Normally, a texturing machine has more than 200 processing stations, of which Figure 2 illustrates by<br><br>
way of example the first three processing stations indicated at numberals 25.1, 25.2, 25.3.  Each of the processing stations 25 processes one yarn.  The takeup units occupy a width of three processing stations. Consequently, respectively three takeup units 20.1, 20.2, 20.3 are arranged in one column in takeup frame 1, with one takeup unit overlying the other, as will be described further below.<br>
Each processing station 25 includes one feed yarn package 7, on which a thermoplastic filament yarn 4 is wound.  The yarn 4 is treated and wound to a package in a plurality of process steps by a plurality of processing units 5.1-5.8, which are successively arranged in the direction of the advancing yarn. Associated to each of processing units 5.1-5.8 is a process controller 6.1-6,8.  The process controllers S.1-6.8 are coupled, via a bus system 29, with a field control unit 27.1.<br>
Individually, the processing units of the texturing machine shown in Figures 1 and 2 are formed by a first feed system 11, a heater 12, a false twist texturing unit 14, a second  feed system 15, a set heater 16, a third feed system 17, a yarn traversing device 19, and a package drive 18.  In a processing station 25, the first feed system 11  unwinds the yarn 4 under a certain tension via a yarn guide 10 and a deflection roll 9.1.  The first feed system 11 includes a motor and a feed shaft connected to the motor.  The feed shaft may be designed and constructed, for example, as a feed roll with a zigzag yarn guide track on its circumference, as disclosed in WO 98/033963. However, it is also possible to construct the feed shaft as a godet, about which the yarn loops several times.  Irrespective of the construction of the feed<br><br>
shaft, an  electric motor is respectively provided for its drive.  Thus, the process controller 6.1 for controlling the motor is designed and constructed as a frequency changer.<br>
In the direction of the advancing yarn, downstream of first feed system 11, a first eloayaLe heater 12 extends, through which the yarn 4 advances. In so doing, the yarn is heated to a certain temperature.  The heater could be constructed as a high-temperature heater, in which the heater surface temperature is more than 300°C.  Such a heater is known, for example, from EP 0 412 429, which is herewith incorporated by reference.  To control the temperature, the heater 12 is associated with process controller 6.2, which is designed and constructed in this instance as a heat control system.<br>
Downstream of heater 12 is a cooling rail 13. The cooling rail 13 is followed by a false twist unit 14 in process frame 3.  This false twist unit 14 may be designed and constructed as a friction disk unit with 3.n  individual motor drive as  disclosed  in EP 0 744 480. Associated to the motor of false twist unit 14 is process controller 6.3, for example, a frequency changer.<br>
Downstream of false twist unit 14, a second, further feed system 15 is used to pull the yarn 4 both over heater 12 and cooling rail 13.  The second feed system 15 is controlled via process controller S.4. The feed system 15 could be constructed in the same way as the previously described first feed system 11.<br>
Located downstream of second  feed system 15, when viewed in the direction of the advancing yarn, is a set heater 15, which is likewise associated with a process controller 6.5.  The set heater 16 is followed<br><br>
by the further, third feed system 17, which advances the yarn 4   from heater 16 to takeup unit 20.1. Associated to feed system 17 is process controller 6.6. The takeup unit 20.1 is arranged in takeup frame 1.  In the takeup unit 20.1, the yarn is wound to a package. The package is driven by package drive 18 aL  a substantially constant circumferential speed.  To this end, the package drive includes a drive roll, which is in direct contact with the circumference of the package.  The drive roll is operated by a motor, which is coupled with process controller 6.8.  Before contacting the package, che yarn 4 is reciprocated by traversing device 19, so that a cross wind forms on the package.  Likewise, the traversing device includes a drive, which is activated by process controller 6.7.<br>
The takeup unit 20.1 includes a package storage 21, which serves to receive full packages, when a full package has been produced on the takeup unit. For removing a full package, a spindle support is pivoted, and the full package is deposited in package storage 21.  In the package storage 21, the full package waits for its removal.  For this reason, the package storage 21 is arranged on the side of the takeup frame 1, which adjoins doffing aisle 24 and faces away from service aisle 23.  Furthermore, each takeup unit 20 is equipped with a tube feed device 22, which not described in greater detail.<br>
Likewise, adjacent processing stations 25.2, 25.3, etc. include above-described processing units 5.1-5.8.  As shown in Figure 2,   the processing stations are successively arranged in a longitudinal direction. The plurality of processing stations of the texturing machine are divided into a plurality of sections 28.1, 28.2, etc.  Shown in Figure 2 are two complete sections<br><br>
28.1 and 28.2.  The sections 28.1 and 28,2 include a plurality of processing stations.  In the present embodiment, twelve juxtaposed processing stations 25 form one section 28.  To each section 28, a field control unit 27 is associated, so that section 28.1 is controlled by field control unit 27.1, and section 28.2 by field control unit 27.2.  In this case, the process controllers 6  of processing stations 25 of one section 28 connect  to  their respectively associated field control unit 27 via a bus system 29.  In the present embodiment, field process control unit 27.1 connects via bus system 29.1 to process controllers 6.1-6.8 of section 28.1.  The field process control unit 27.2 connects via bus system 29.2 to process controllers 6 of section 28.2.  All processing stations of the texturing machine are divided in this way.<br>
The field control units 27,1 and 27.2 are coupled with a microprocessor 33, which enables, for the purpose of operation, both a data display and data change to each of the field control units 27.  To this end, the microprocessor 33 connects to an operator-controllable visual display unit 34.  In the cases, wherein a separate operation for controlling and monitoring the sections is desired, it would also be possible to connect microprocessor 33 to two separate visual display units.<br>
In the texturing machine shown in Figures 1 and 2, all processing stations of section 28.1 are monitored and controlled by field control unit 27.1 independently of the processing stations of adjacent sections 28.2 etc.  Each section forms a partial machine, which may be operated independently of the adjacent section.  Only the energy supply to the sections (not shown) occurs from a central interface.<br><br>
since the texturing machine connects to one feed line of supply voltage.   Likewise devices, such as, for example, the compressed-air supply system for removing waste yarn by suction, are supplied from a central interface.<br>
Figure 3 schematically illustrates the coupling between the process controllers of the processing stations of one section with a field control unit, as is realized in the texturing machine of Figures 1 and 2, the Figure showing for each processing station 25 only a portion of the processing stations of the section and only a portion of the processing units of a processing station.  As an example, four processing stations 25.1, 25.2, 25.3, and 25.4 are selected.  For advancing and drawing the yarn, each processing station includes a total of three processing units 5.1, 5.4, and 5.6, which are designed and constructed as feed systems 11, 15, and 17.  For the sake of clarity, the schematic in Figure 3 shows only the drives of the processing units.  Thus, processing station 25.1 includes processing units 5.1.1, 5.4.1, and 5.6.1.  Likewise, processing station 25.2 includes the same processing units 5.1.2, 5.4.2, and 5.6.2.  The processing units associated to processing stations 25.3 and 25.4 are arranged in an analogous manner. Associated to each processing unit 5.1 is respectively one individual process controller 5.1, so that in processing station 25.1, the processing unit 5.1.1 is coupled with process controller 6.1.1.  In a corresponding manner, the processing unit 5.4.1 is coupled with process controller 6.4.1, and processing unit 5.6.1 with process controller 6.6.1.  The other processing stations 25.2, 25.3, and 25,4 are likewise constructed in such a manner that each processing unit<br><br>
5 is coupled with a dedicated, process controller 6.  In the illustrated embodiment, five drives are selected as processing units, so that the process controllers 6 could be formed by frequency changers.<br>
All process controllers 6.1, 6.4, and 6.6 of processing stations 25.1, 25.2, 25.3, and 25.4 are coupled via bus system 29.1 to field control unit 27.1. With that, it is possible to individually activate each of the processing units of each of the processing stations.<br>
Figure 4 schematically illustrates a further embodiment for activating the processing units within a section, the section being controlled by field control unit 27,1.  Shown as an example are only four processing stations 25.1, 25.2, 25.3, and 25.4 of the section, with the drives of feed systems 11, 15, and 17 having again been selected, for example, as processing units.  Thus, processing station 25.1 comprises processing units 5.1.1, 5.4.1, and 5.6.1, and processing station 25.2 processing units 5.1.2, 5.4.2, and 5,6.2.  The further processing stations are realized in a corresponding manner.  The processing units 5.1.1, 5.1.2, 5.1.3, and 5.1.4 of processing stations 25.1, 25.2, 25.3, and 25.4 are combined to a group and jointly activated via process controller 6.1. Likewise, the processing units 5.4 of processing stations 25.1, 25.2, 25.3, and 25.4 are combined to one group and coupled with process controller 6.4.  The processing units 5.6 of all processing stations connect to process controller 6.6.  Via bus system 29.1. the process controllers 6.1, 6.4, and 6.6 connect to field control unit 27.1.  Such a coupling of the processing units is advantageous, in particular for drives of the processing stations, which are  operated at the same<br><br>
speed.  The process controllers 6.1, 6.4, and 6.6 thus represent a group frequency changer, which controls all connected drives in like manner.<br>
Figures 5 and 6 schematically illustrate further examples of coupling and monitoring the processing units of a section with a field control unit.  The embodiment shown in Figure 5 is identical with the coupling shown in Figure 4.  To this extent, the foregoing description is herewith incorporated by reference and only the differences are described in the following.<br>
The processing units 5.1 of processing stations 25.1-25.4 are jointly connected to process controller 6.1, with a switch 30.1 being associated to each processing unit 5.1.  The switch 30.1 permits interrupting the connection between process controller 5.1 and the respective processing unit 5.1.  To this end, the switch 30.1 is activated directly by field control unit 27.1.  Associated to each of the processing units 5.1 is a sensor arrangement 32.1, which connects to field control unit 27.1.  in the same way, a switch 30.2 and a sensor arrangement 32i2 are associated to processing units 5.4 in processing stations 25.1, 25.2, 25.3, and 25.4.  Likewise, the processing units 5.6 of the four processing stations 25.1, 25.2, 25.3, and 25.4 are each coupled via a switch 30.3 to process controller 6.6.  Furthermore, the processing units 5.6 are associated with sensors 32.3.1-32.3.4.<br>
In the embodiment of the texturing machine according to the invention as shown in Figure 5, at least one parameter in processing unit 5 is monitored via the sensor arrangement 32.  This may be, for example, a monitoring of the rotational speed, or a<br><br>
monitoring of the temperature.  The actually measured data are supplied by sensor arrangement 32 to field control unit 27.1.  In the case that one of the processing units 5 shows an unacceptable parameter value, the field control unit 27.1 will activate switch 30.1, which is associated to processing unit 5.  Thus, the affected processing unit 5 is immediately decoupled from process controller 6.  This permits eliminating, for example, yarm breaks in one processing station without affecting adjacent processing stations, which are associated to the same controller.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates a further embodiment of a control device with a group control.  The setup and arrangement of the units correspond substantially to the setup of the schematic shown in Figure 5, so that the foregoing description is herewith incorporated by reference.  Other than in the embodiment shown in Figure 5, the switches 30,1.1-30.1.4 of adjacent processing stations 25.1-25.4 connect to a monitoring unit 31.1.  Likewise, the sensor arrangements 32.1.1-32.1.4 of adjacent processing stations 25.1-25.4 are linked to monitoring unit 31.1.  The monitoring unit 31.1 stores desired parameters of the individual processing units 5.1.1-5.1.4.  As soon as one of the sensors 32.1 signals a deviating parameter, the switch 30.1 associated to processing unit 5.1 will be activated.  The control and monitoring of processing units 5.4 and 5.6 proceed in the same way.  Associated to processing units 5.4 is monitoring unit 31.2, and to processing units 5.6 monitoring unit 31.3.  For purposes of both exchanging data and receiving overriding commands, the monitoring units 31.2, 31.2, and 31.3 connect to field control unit 27.1.<br><br>
In the above described embodiments of the texturing machine according to the invention, the number of processing stations within a section is exemplary.  Thus, it is easy to combine six, eight, ten, or even more processing stations to one section. Advantageously, the sections may also be formed by selecting predetermined separations in the creel frame as reference for selecting the number of processing stations.  Thus, it is known that creel frames are formed by a plurality of movable units, each of the units holding, for example, twelve feed yarn packages. In this instance, a section corresponds to a creel gauge.<br>
Likewise, the number and the construction of processing units are exemplary.  The texturing machine may comprise, for example, only two feed systems, with the takeup unit following directly the second feed system.  However, it is also possible to provide a plurality of feed systems as processing units, so that, for example, between the false twist unit and the set heater two feed systems follow each other, between which a further processing unit is arranged for entangling the yarns.  Regardless of the realization of the processing units and process controllers, the method of the present invention and the texturing machine of the present invention distinguish themselves in that a plurality of processing stations are divided into few sections and can be controlled as small units in a simple manner.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
