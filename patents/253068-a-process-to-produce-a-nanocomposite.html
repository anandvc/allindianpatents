				<td>SPLIT-STREAM PROCESS FOR MAKING NANOCQMPOSITES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] This invention relates to low-permeability nanocomposites useful for air barriers, processes to produce the same, and their use in articles of manufacture.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]       Nanocomposites are polymer systems containing inorganic particles with at least one dimension in the nanometer range.  Some examples of these are disclosed   in   US   6,060,549,   6,103,817,   6,034,164,   5,973,053,   5,936,023, 5,883,173, 5,807,629, 5,665,183, 5,576,373, and 5,576,372.   Common types of inorganic particles used in nanocomposites are phyllosilicates, an inorganic substance from the general class of so called "nano-clays" or "clays".   Ideally, intercalation should take place in the nanocomposite, wherein the polymer inserts into the space or gallery between the clay surfaces.  Ultimately, it is desirable to have exfoliation, wherein the polymer is fully dispersed with the individual nanometer-size clay platelets.   Due to the general enhancement in air barrier qualities of various polymer blends when clays are present, there is a desire to have a nanocomposite with low air permeability; especially a dynamically vulcanized elastomer nanocomposite such as used in the manufacture of tires. [0003]       The preparation of nanocomposites uses a number of methods to generate exfoliated clays. One of the most common methods relies upon the use of organically modified  montmorillonite  clays.     Organoclays  are  typically produced through solution based ion-exchange reactions that replace sodium ions that exist on the surface of sodium montmorillonite with organic molecules such as alkyl or aryl ammonium compounds and typically known in the industry as swelling or exfoliating agents.  See, e.g., US 5,807,629, WO 02/100935, and WO 02/100936.  Other background references  include US  5,576,373,  5,665,183, 5,807,629,   5,936,023,   6,121,361,  WO   94/22680,  WO   01/85831,  and  WO 04/058874.<br><br>
[0004] One method to improve the organoclay performance is to use functionalized polymers to treat the clay. This approach uses materials that are soluble in water or to materials that can be incorporated into the polymerization reaction. This approach has been used to prepare nylon nanocomposites, using for example, oligomeric and monomeric caprolactam as the modifier. Polyolefin nanocomposites, such as polypropylene nanocomposites, have utilized maleic anhydride grafted polypropylenes to achieve some success in the formation of nanocomposites.<br>
[0005] For example, it is known to utilize exfoliated-clay filled nylon as a high impact plastic matrix, such as disclosed in US 6,060,549 to Li et al. In particular, Li et al. disclose a blend of a thermoplastic resin such as nylon and a copolymer of a â‚¬4 to C7 isoolefin and a para-methylstyrene and a para-(halomethylstyrene), the blend also including nylon containing exfoliated-clays that are used as a high impact material. Further, Japanese Unexamined Application P2000-160024 to Yuichi et al. discloses a thermoplastic elastomer composition which can be used as an air barrier. The nanocomposite in Yuichi et al. includes is a blend similar to that disclosed in Li et al.<br>
[0006] Elastomeric nanocomposite innerliners and innertubes have also been formed using a complexing agent and a rubber, where the agent is a reactive rubber having positively charged groups and a layered silicate uniformly dispersed therein. See, for example, Kresge et al. US 5,665,183 and 5,576,373. This approach uses pre-formed positively charged reactive rubber components. [0007] Nanocomposites have also been formed using non-ionic, brominated copolymers of isobutylene and para-methylstyrene, and blends of these copolymers with other polymers. See, for example, Elspass et al., US 5,807,629, and US 6,034,164.<br>
[0008] As described above, these nanocomposites are made by mixing of elastomers and organoclays either at melt state or in solution; and, due to the hydrophobic nature of the polymer, the organoclays are typically modified to provide better interaction between the clays and the polymers. The modification process typically involves exchange of Na+ cations in the inorganic clay with<br><br>
organic modifiers such as tetra alkyl ammonium salts.  The process is expensive and most modified clays are not exfoliated in polymers or in organic solvent. [0009]       In commonly assigned co-pending application US Serial No., (un-assigned), "Functionalized Isobutylene Polymer-Inorganic Clay Nanocomposites and Organic-Aqueous Emulsion Process," Weiqing Weng et al., filed of even date herewith,  an organic-aqueous  emulsion process is disclosed in which clay dispersed in an aqueous phase is mixed with a functionalized elastomer cement, and a nanocomposite is recovered from the emulsion.  Because the process does not rely on dispersing the clay in an organic phase, the clay can be an unmodified inorganic clay that is dispersed in water, optionally with an emulsifier and/or the elastomer can be functionalized with emulsifying moieties. [0010]       Another reference of interest includes WO 98/03562. [0011]       Regardless of the method of preparing the nanocomposites, the art generally makes the nanocomposite as a separate step apart from other polymer processing.  Moreover, the art generally processes the bulk of the polymer to be made into the nanocomposite since masterbatching frequently leads to undesirable gel formation. There is a need for a less costly, more efficient method to produce polymer / clay nanocomposites.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0012] The present invention provides a less costly, more efficient method to manufacture polymer-clay nanocomposites. The method can be integrated with an elastomer halogenation process by treating a relatively small slipstream of polymer solution from the halogenation process with a clay dispersion to form a concentrated polymer-clay stream, and returning the concentrated polymer-clay stream to the halogenation process to be mixed with a main polymer stream. The return polymer-clay stream is sufficiently concentrated to provide the desired total clay content in the elastomer product after blending with the remaining polymer stream, but not so concentrated as to adversely affect polymer properties, e.g. gel formation. The slipstream can be taken at any suitable point in the halogenation process upstream from halogenated elastomer recovery, for example, following a<br><br>
caustic washing step but before the final solvent removal step. Similarly, the polymer-clay concentrate stream can be returned for blending with the remaining polymer stream at any suitable point in the halogenation process, for example, downstream from the slipstream takeoff but upstream from final solvent removal. [0013] In one embodiment the invention provides a process to produce a nanocomposite including the steps of: (a) contacting a solution of elastomer in an organic solvent with a halogen to form a halogenated elastomer cement; (b) treating a first portion of the halogenated elastomer cement with a clay dispersion to form a masterbatch comprising a concentrated polymer-clay nanocomposite dispersion; (c) blending the masterbatch with a second portion of the halogenated elastomer cement to form a mixture comprising a dispersed halogenated elastomer-clay nanocomposite; and (d) recovering the halogenated elastomer-clay nanocomposite from the mixture.<br>
[0014] In one embodiment, the process can also include the step of neutralizing the halogenated elastomer cement from step (a) prior to the treatment in step (b). In another embodiment, neutralizing the mixture from step (c) can occur prior to the recovery in step (d).<br>
[0015] In one embodiment, the elastomer can be a butyl rubber. The concentration of the butyl rubber in the cement can range from 1 to 30 percent by weight. In another embodiment, the butyl rubber can range from 10 to 25 percent by weight of the cement. The concentration of the clay in the dispersion can range from 0.1 to 5 percent by weight of the dispersion. In another embodiment, the amount of clay in the dispersion can range from 0.3 to 3 percent by weight of dispersion. The pH of the dispersion can be between 4 and 13, for example. The volume ratio of clay dispersion to halogenated elastomer cement in step (b) can range from 0.01:1 to 1:1 in one embodiment, and from 0.1:1 to 0.9:1, or from 0.3:1 to 0.7:1 in other embodiments.<br>
[0016] The weight ratio of the first portion of halogenated elastomer cement to the second portion of halogenated elastomer cement can be from 1:99 to 30:70 on a liquid-free basis, preferably 3:97 to 20:80, more preferably 5:95 to 10:90.<br><br>
[0017] The clay dispersion can include inorganic clay, can be essentially free of organically modified clay (organoclay), or can include organoclay. The clay can be dispersed in any liquid medium as desired, such as, for example, water, organic liquid which can be miscible or immiscible with water, and/or in a mixture of water and organic liquid which can be in the form of a solution or an emulsion. The clay dispersion can include various modifiers, surfactants, emulsifiers, stablizers, exfoliants, or the like. In one embodiment, the clay dispersion can be an aqueous slurry of inorganic clay.<br>
[0018] The halogenated elastomer can be a halogenated isobutylene polymer. The halogen can be bromine, chlorine, or mixtures thereof. [0019] The recovery step can include filtering the nanocomposite from the mixture or from at least one phase of the mixture where the mixture is an emulsion. In another embodiment, the recovery can include precipitating the elastomer-clay nanocomposite with an antisolvent, for example, from the mixture, which can optionally be concentrated by liquid removal before the precipitation step. In another embodiment, the recovery can include evaporating liquid from at least one phase of the mixture. In one embodiment, the clay dispersion is inorganic clay in an aqueous slurry, and the recovery can include evaporating solvent from the mixture from (c) to form an aqueous nanocomposite suspension, and processing the suspension through one or more extruders to dry the nanocomposite.<br>
[0020] In one embodiment, the first portion of the halogenated polymer solution can be functionalized to form a polymer chain E comprising an ammonium-functionalized group, hi a particular embodiment, the ammonium functionalized group can be described by the following group pendant to the polymer chain E:<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0037]       This  invention  describes  a  process  for making polymer /  clay<br>
nanocomposites.   The process can produce a nanocomposite of a halogenated<br>
elastomer and a clay, desirably an exfoliated clay, suitable for use as an air barrier.<br>
The nanocomposite formed by the process of this invention has improved air<br>
barrier properties and is suitable for use as an innerliner or innertube.<br>
Definitions<br>
[0038]      As used herein, the new numbering scheme for the Periodic Table<br>
Groups is used as set forth in CHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING NEWS, 63(5), 27<br>
(1985).<br>
[0039]       As used herein, "polymer" may be used to refer to homopolyniers,<br>
copolymers, interpolymers, terpolymers, etc.  Likewise, a copolymer may refer to<br>
a polymer comprising at least two monomers, optionally with other monomers.<br>
[0040]       As used herein, when a polymer is referred to as comprising a<br>
monomer, the monomer is present in the polymer in the polymerized form of the<br>
monomer or in the derivative form the monomer.    Likewise, when catalyst<br><br>
components are described as comprising neutral stable forms of the components, it<br>
is well understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, that the ionic form of the<br>
component is the form that reacts with the monomers to produce polymers.<br>
[0041]       As used herein, "elastomer" or "elastomeric composition" refers to any<br>
polymer or composition of polymers (such as blends of polymers) consistent with<br>
the ASTM D1566 definition. Elastomer includes mixed blends of polymers such<br>
as melt mixing and/or reactor blends of polymers.    The terms may be used<br>
interchangeably with the term "rubber."<br>
[0042]       As used herein, "phr" is 'parts per hundred rubber' and is a measure<br>
common in the art wherein components of a composition are measured relative to<br>
a major elastomer component, based upon 100 parts by weight of the elastomer(s)<br>
or rubber(s).<br>
[0043]       As used herein, "isobutylene based elastomer" or "isobutylene based<br>
polymer" refers to elastomers or polymers comprising at least 70 mole percent<br>
repeat units from isobutylene.<br>
[0044]       As used herein, isoolefin refers to any olefin monomer having at least<br>
one carbon having two substitutions on that carbon.<br>
[0045]       As used herein, "multiolefin" refers to any monomer having two or<br>
more unsaturations (typically double bonds), for example, a multiolefin may be<br>
any monomer comprising two conjugated double bonds such as a conjugated diene<br>
such as isoprene.<br>
[0046]       As used herein, "nanocomposite" or "nanocomposite composition"<br>
refers to polymer systems containing inorganic particles with at least one<br>
dimension in the nanometer range within a polymer matrix.<br>
[0047]       As used herein, "intercalation" refers to the state of a composition in<br>
which a polymer is present between the layers of a platelet filler. As is recognized<br>
in the industry and by academia, some indicia of intercalation can be the shifting<br>
and/or weakening of detection of X-ray lines as compared to that of original<br>
platelet fillers, indicating a larger spacing between vermiculite layers than in the<br>
original mineral.<br><br>
 [0048] As used herein, "exfoliation" refers to the separation of individual layers of the original inorganic particle, so that polymer can surround or surrounds each particle. In an embodiment, sufficient polymer is present between the platelets such that the platelets are randomly spaced. For example, some indication of exfoliation or intercalation may be a plot showing no X-ray lines or larger d-spacing because of the random spacing or increased separation of layered platelets. However, as recognized in the industry and by academia, other indicia may be useful to indicate the results of exfoliation such as permeability testing, electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, etc.<br>
[0049] As used herein, "solvent" refers to any substance capable of dissolving another substance. When the term solvent is used it may refer to at least one solvent or two or more solvents unless specified. In certain embodiments, the solvent is polar; in other embodiments, the solvent is non-polar. [0050] As used herein, "solution" refers to a uniformly dispersed mixture at the molecular level or ionic level, of one or more substances (solute) in one or more substances (solvent). For example, solution process refers to a mixing process that both the elastomer and the modified layered filler remain in the same organic solvent or solvent mixtures.<br>
[0051]       As used herein, "suspension" refers to a system consisting of a solid dispersed in a solid, liquid, or gas usually in particles of larger than colloidal size.

Vanderbilt Co., Inc. 1990), and in RUBBER TECHNOLOGY 311-321 (Maurice Morton ed., Chapman &amp; Hall 1995). Butyl rubbers, halogenated butyl rubbers, and star-branched butyl rubbers are   described   by   Edward   Kresge   and   H.C.   Wang   in   8   KlRK-OiHMER<br><br>
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY 934-955 (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 4th ed. 1993).<br>

Some embodiments of the halogenated rubber component are also described in US 4,703,091 and 4,632,963. [0066]       More particularly, in one embodiment of the brominated rubber component of the invention, a halogenated butyl rubber is used. The halogenated butyl rubber is produced from the halogenation of butyl rubber.   Preferably, the olefin polymerization feeds employed in producing the halogenated butyl rubber of the invention are those olefinic compounds conventionally used in the preparation of butyl-type rubber polymers.   The butyl polymers are prepared by reacting a comonomer mixture, the mixture having at least (1) a C4 to C7 isoolefin monomer component such as isobutylene with (2) a multiolefin, or conjugated diene, monomer component.  The isoolefin is in a range from 70 to 99.5 weight percent by weight of the total comonomer mixture in one embodiment, and 85 to 99.5 weight percent in another embodiment. The conjugated diene component in one embodiment is present in the comonomer mixture from 30 to 0.5 weight percent in one embodiment, and from 15 to 0.5 weight percent in another embodiment.   In yet another embodiment, from 8 to 0.5 weight percent of the comonomer mixture is conjugated diene.<br>
[0067] The isoolefin is a C4 to C6 compound such as isobutylene, isobutene 2-methyl-1-butene, 3-methyl-1-butene, 2-methyl-2-butene, and 4-methyl-l-pentene. The multiolefin is a C4 to C14 conjugated diene such as isoprene, butadiene, 2,3-<br><br>
dimethyl-1,3-butadiene,     myrcene,     6,6-dimethyl-fulvene,     cyclopentadiene,<br>
hexadiene and piperylene.   One embodiment of the butyl rubber polymer of the<br>
invention is obtained by reacting 92 to 99.5 weight percent of isobutylene with 0.5<br>
to 8 weight percent isoprene, or reacting 95 to 99.5 weight percent isobutylene<br>
with from 0.5 to 5.0 weight percent isoprene in yet another embodiment.<br>
[0068]       Halogenated butyl rubber is produced by the halogenation of the butyl<br>
rubber product described above.  Halogenation can be carried out by any means,<br>
and the invention is not herein limited by the halogenation process.  Methods of<br>
halogenating polymers such as butyl polymers are disclosed in US 2,631,984,<br>
3,099,644, 4,554,326, 4,681,921, 4,650,831, 4,384,072, 4,513,116 and 5,681,901.<br>
In one embodiment, the halogen is in the so called  II and III structures as discussed<br>
in, for example, RUBBER TECHNOLOGY at 298-299 (1995).   In one embodiment,<br>
the butyl rubber is halogenated in hexane diluent at from 40 to 60Â°C using<br>
bromine (Eto) or chlorine (C) as the halogenation agent. The halogenated butyl<br>
rubber has a Mooney Viscosity of from 20 to 70 (ML 1+8 at 125Â°C) in one<br>
embodiment, and from 25 to 55 in another embodiment.  The halogen content is<br>
from 0.1 to 10 weight percent based in on the weight of the halogenated butyl<br>
rubber in one embodiment, and from 0.5  to 5 weight percent in another<br>
embodiment.    In yet another embodiment, the halogen weight percent of the<br>
halogenated butyl rubber is from 1 to 2.2 weight percent.<br>
[0069] In another embodiment, the halogenated butyl or star-branched butyl rubber may be halogenated such that the halogenation is primarily allylic in nature. This is typically achieved by such means as free radical bromination or free radical chlorination, or by such methods as secondary treatment of electrophilically halogenated rubbers, such as by heating the rubber, to form the allylic halogenated butyl and star-branched butyl rubber. Common methods of forming the allylic halogenated polymer are disclosed by Gardner et al. in US 4,632,963; US 4,649,178; US 4,703,091. Thus, in one embodiment of the invention, the halogenated butyl rubber is such that the halogenated multiolefin units are primary allylic halogenated units, and wherein the primary allylic configuration is present to at least 20 mole percent (relative to the total amount of halogenated multiolefin)<br><br>
in one embodiment, and at least 30 mole percent in another embodiment. This arrangement can be described as follows (6), wherein X is a halogen, desirably chlorine or bromine, and q is at least 20 mole percent based on the total moles of halogen in one embodiment, and at least 30 mole percent in another embodiment, and from 25 mole percent to 90 mole percent in yet another embodiment:<br><br>

[0093]       The compositions of the invention may also contain other conventional<br>
additives  such  as  dyes,  pigments,  antioxidants,  heat  and  light  stabilizers,<br>
plasticizers, oils and other ingredients as known in the art.<br>
[0094]       Blending of the fillers, additives, and/or curative components may be<br>
carried out by combining the desired components and the nanocomposite of the<br>
present invention in any suitable mixing device such as a Banburyâ„¢ mixer,<br>
Brabenderâ„¢ mixer or preferably a mixer/extruder and mixing at temperatures in<br>
the range of 120Â°C up to 300Â°C under conditions of shear sufficient to allow the<br>
components to become uniformly dispersed within the polymer to form the<br>
nanocomposite.<br>
[0095]       The composition of this invention may be extruded, compression<br>
molded, blow molded or injection molded into various shaped articles including<br>
fibers, films, industrial parts such as automotive parts, appliance housings,<br>
consumer products, packaging and the like.   The resulting articles exhibit both<br>
high impact strength and low vapor permeability.  In particular, the composition<br>
described herein is useful for air barriers such as bladders, and automotive<br>
(including  truck,   commercial  and/or passenger)  or  aircraft  innerliners  and<br>
innertubes.<br>
Clays<br>
[0096]       The nanocomposites of the present invention can include swellable<br>
inorganic clay.     Swellable layered inorganic clay materials suitable for the<br>
purposes of this invention include natural or synthetic phyllosilicates, particularly<br>
smectic  clays  such  as  montmorillonite,  nontronite,  beidellite,  volkonskoite,<br>
laponite, hectorite, saponite, sauconite, magadite, kenyaite, stevensite and the like,<br>
as well as vermiculite, halloysite, aluminate oxides, hydrotalcite and the like.<br>
These layered clays generally comprise particles containing a plurality of silicate<br><br>
platelets having a thickness of 5-20A, preferably 8-12A tightly bound together at interlayer spacings of 4A or less, and contain exchangeable cations such as Na+, Ca+2, K+ or Mg+2 present at the interlayer surfaces.<br>
[0097] The layered clay can be exfoliated by suspending the clay in a water solution. Preferably, the concentration of clay in water is sufficiently low to minimize the interaction between clay particles and to fully exfoliate the clay. In one embodiment, the aqueous slurry of clay can have a clay concentration of between 0.1 and 5.0 weight percent; between 0.1 and 3.0 weight percent in other embodiments.<br>
[0098] hi certain embodiments, an aqueous slurry of clay can be prepared by stirring clay and water at room temperature for a time sufficient to exfoliate the clay. In one embodiment, the clay and water can be stirred for between 0.25 and 24 hours. The clay and water can be stirred for between 4 and 16 hours, or between 10 and 14 hours, in other embodiments.<br>
[0099]       hi other embodiments, the clay can be mixed with an organic liquid to<br>
form a clay dispersion.   The clay can be an inorganic clay or an organically<br>
modified clay; the organic liquid can be miscible or immiscible in water.   In<br>
certain embodiments, the dispersion can have a clay concentration of between 0.1<br>
and 5.0 weight percent; between 0.1 and 3.0 weight percent in other embodiments.<br>
[0100]       The layered clay can also be intercalated and exfoliated by treatment<br>
with organic molecules (swelling or exfoliating "agents" or "additives") capable of<br>
undergoing ion exchange reactions with the cations present at the interlayer<br>
surfaces of the layered silicate.   Suitable exfoliating additives include cationic<br>
surfactants such as ammonium ion, alkylamines or alkylammonium ion (primary,<br>
secondary, tertiary and quaternary), phosphonium or sulfonium derivatives of<br>
aliphatic, aromatic or arylaliphatic amines, phosphines and sulfides.   Desirable<br>
amine compounds (or the corresponding ammonium ion) are those with the<br>
structure R12R13R14N, wherein R12, R13, and R14 are C1 to C30 alkyls or alkenes in<br>
one embodiment, C1 to C20 alkyls or alkenes in another embodiment, which may<br>
be the same or different.  In one embodiment, the exfoliating agent is a so called<br>
long chain tertiary amine, wherein at least R12 is a C14 to C20 alkyl or alkene.<br><br>
 [0101]       The exfoliating agent can also be a diamine coumpound (or the<br>
corresponding ammonium or diammonium ion), such as diaminoalkane, N-alkyl-<br>
diaminoalkane,       N,N-dialkyl-diaminoalkyl,       N,N,N'-trialkyl-diaminoalkane,<br>
N,N,N',N'-tetraalkyl-diaminoalkane, or the like. Desirable diamines can have the<br>
structure R18R19N-R20-NR21R22, wherein R18, R19, R20, R21, and R22 are the same<br>
or different C1 toC30 alkyls or alkenes, or C1to C20 alkyls or alkenes.  When a<br>
long chain diamine is desired, at least one of the N-alkyl or N-alkene groups (i.e.<br>
R18, R19,R21, and or R22) has from 8 to 30 carbon atoms, preferably from 14 to 20<br>
carbon atoms.   Specific non-limiting, illustrative examples include N-coco-1,3-<br>
diaminopropane,    N-oleyl-l,3-diaminopropane,    N-tallow-l,3-diaminopropane,<br>
N,N,N'-trimethyl-N'-tallow-l,3-diaminopropane, and so on.<br>
[0102]       Another class of exfoliating additives include those which can be<br>
covalently bonded to the interlayer surfaces.   These include polysilanes of the<br>
structure -Si(R15)2R16 where R15 is the same or different at each occurrence and is<br>
selected from alkyl, alkoxy or oxysilane and R16 is an organic radical compatible<br>
with the matrix polymer of the composite, preferably an alkyl,  alkoxy or<br>
oxysilane.<br>
[0103] Other suitable exfoliating additives include protonated amino acids and salts thereof containing 2-30 carbon atoms such as 12-aminododecanoic acid, epsilon-caprolactam and like materials. Suitable swelling agents and processes for intercalating layered silicates are disclosed in US 4,472,538, 4,810,734, 4,889,885 as well as WO92/02582.<br>
[0104] In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the exfoliating additive or additives are capable of reaction with the halogen sites on the interpolymer to form complexes which help exfoliate the clay. In one embodiment, the additive includes all primary, secondary and tertiary amines and phosphines; alkyl and aryl sulfides and thiols; and their polyfunctional versions. Desirable additives include: long-chain tertiary amines such as N,N-dimethyl-octadecylamine, N,N-dioctadecyl-methylamine, so called dihydrogenated tallowalkyl-methylamine and the like, and amine-terminated polytetrahydrofuran; long-chain thiol and thiosulfate compounds like hexamethylene sodium thiosulfate.<br><br>
 [0105] The exfoliating additive such as described herein is present in the composition in an amount to achieve optimal air retention as measured by the permeability testing described herein. For example, the additive may be present from 0.1 to 20 phr in one embodiment, and from 0.2 to 15 phr in yet another embodiment, and from 0.3 to 10 phr in yet another embodiment. The exfoliating additive may be added to the composition at any stage; for example, the additive may be added to the interpolymer, followed by addition of the clay, or may be added to the interpolymer and clay mixture; or the additive may be first blended with the clay, followed by blending with the interpolymer in yet another embodiment.<br>
[0106]       In another embodiment of the  invention,  improved interpolymer<br>
impermeability is achieved by the presence of at least one polyfunctional curative.<br>
An embodiment of such polyfunctional curatives can be described by the formula<br>
Z--R17--Z', wherein R17 is one of a C1 to C15 alkyl, C2 to C15 alkenyl, and C6 to C12<br>
cyclic aromatic moiety, substituted or unsubstituted; and Z and Z' are the same or<br>
different and are one of a thiosulfate group, mercapto group, aldehyde group,<br>
carboxylic acid group, peroxide group, alkenyl group, or other similar group that is<br>
capable of crosslinking, either intermolecularly or intramolecularly, one or more<br>
strands of a polymer having reactive groups such as unsaturation.  So-called bis-<br>
thiosulfate compounds are an example of a desirable class of polyfunctional<br>
compounds included in the above formula.    Non-limiting examples of such<br>
polyfunctional  curatives  are  as   hexamethylene  bis(sodium  thiosulfate)   and<br>
hexamethylene bis(cinnamaldehyde), and others are well known in the rubber<br>
compounding arts.   These and other suitable agents are disclosed in, for example,<br>
the BLUE BOOK, MATERIALS, COMPOUNDING INGREDIENTS, MACHINERY AND<br>
SERVICES FOR RUBBER (Don. R. Smith, ed., Lippincott &amp; Petto Inc. 2001).   The<br>
polyfunctional curative, if present, may be present in the composition from 0.1 to<br>
8 phr in one embodiment, and from 0.2 to 5 phr in yet another embodiment.<br>
[0107]       Treatment  with  the   swelling  agents  described   above  results  in<br>
intercalation or "exfoliation" of the layered platelets as a consequence of a<br>
reduction of the ionic forces holding the layers together and introduction of<br><br>
molecules between layers which serve to space the layers at distances of greater<br>
than 4A, preferably greater than 9A. This separation allows the layered silicate to<br>
more readily sorb polymerizable monomer material and polymeric material<br>
between the layers and facilitates further delamination of the layers when the<br>
intercalate is shear mixed with matrix polymer material to provide a uniform<br>
dispersion of the exfoliated layers within the polymer matrix.<br>
[0108]       The   amount   of  clay   or   exfoliated   clay   incorporated   in   the<br>
nanocomposites in accordance with this invention is sufficient to develop an<br>
improvement   in   the   mechanical   properties   or   barrier   properties   of  the<br>
nanocomposite, for example, tensile strength or oxygen permeability. Amounts of<br>
clay in the nanocomposite generally will range from 0.5 to 10 weight percent in<br>
one embodiment, and from 1 to 5 weight percent in another embodiment, based on<br>
the polymer content of the nanocomposite. Expressed in parts per hundred rubber,<br>
the clay or exfoliated clay may be present from 1 to 30 phr in one embodiment,<br>
and from 5 to 20 phr in another embodiment.<br>
Integrated Halogenation of Butyl Rubbers and Nanocomposite Processing [0109] Figures 1-6 illustrate integrated processes for the production of halogenated elastomer / clay nanocomposites, where like numerals represent like parts. The integrated production of nanocomposites minimizes production costs by advantageously utilizing the existing separation / finishing equipment as well as the existing elastomer dissolution equipment. This can avoid separate and/or additional processing steps such as preparation of rubber solutions or dispersions, solvent/water removal, melt-mixing, rubber recovery, etc. that might otherwise be involved where the clay is introduced into the nanocomposite composition in a stand-alone process. The processes as described herein can also improve intercalation and exfoliation of clay in a halogenated or a functionalized halogenated elastomer. The processes can additionally limit the formation of gel and unprocessable elastomer.<br>
[0110] Referring to Figure 1, in one embodiment, a solution 10 of elastomer in hexane or other solvent is contacted with halogen 12 under vigorous mixing in a halogenation reactor 14, producing reactor effluent stream 16 comprising a<br><br>
halogenated rubber. The halogenation of butyl rubbers is described in detail in US 4,074,035, 5,071,913, 5,286,804, 5,182,333 and 6,228,978, and in RUBBER TECHNOLOGY, 298 - 300 (Maurice Morton ed., Chapman &amp; Hall 1995). Halogen 12 can be bromine or chlorine, for example.<br>
[0111] Reactor effluent stream 16 can be divided into two portions 18, 20. Halogenated elastomer portion 18 can be mixed with clay or clay dispersion 22 in vessel 24 to form a masterbatch 26 containing a concentrated elastomer / clay mixture. The masterbatch 26 can be combined with second elastomer portion 20 to form stream 28 comprising a diluted elastomer / clay nanocomposite. The dilute elastomer / clay nanocomposite can then be recovered using typical halogenated elastomer finishing equipment (not shown) in a manner well known in the art. As one example, separation of the nanocomposite mixture from any solvents and/or water can include vaporization, recovery, and recycle of any organic solvent; the resulting nanocomposite - water slurry can then be finished in a series of extruders, and the dried nanocomposite baled.<br>
[0112] In particular embodiments, the clay 22 can be organic clay or inorganic clay; the clay 22 can be modified prior to or during the formation of the masterbatch 26; the clay dispersion 22 can be slurried in water or in an organic solvent, which can be either miscible or immiscible in water; clay slurry 22 can have a pH from 4 to 13; halogenated elastomer portion 18 can be functionalized prior to or during the formation of the masterbatch 26; halogenated elastomer solution 16 can be neutralized prior to dividing halogenated elastomer solution 16 into first and second portions; halogenated portion 20 can be neutralized with excess neutralizing agent to account for solution 18; neutralization of the halogenated elastomer streams can occur after combining the nanocomposite masterbatch 26 with the second portion 20. Each of these embodiments is described in detail with respect to Figures 2-6.<br>
[0113] Referring to Figure 2, in one embodiment, clay 22 can be inorganic clay. A modifying agent can be added to vessel 24 via stream 30 to modify the inorganic clay and to form a halogenated elastomer / organic modified clay nanocomposite recovered via stream 26. In another embodiment, a<br><br>
functionalizing agent can be added to vessel 24 via stream 32 to functionalize the halogenated elastomer and to form a functionalized halogenated elastomer / inorganic clay nanocomposite. In other embodiments, functionalizing agent 32 and modifying agent 30 can both be added to vessel 24 to form a functionalized halogenated elastomer / organic modified clay nanocomposite recovered via stream 26.<br>
[0114] In other embodiments, the functionalization of the elastomer and / or the modification of the clay can occur in separate vessels or reactors. For example, referring to Figure 3, optionally, the functionalizing agent 32 can be added to the halogenated elastomer in vessel 34, resulting in functionalized halogenated stream 36, and / or the modifying agent 30 can be added to the clay 22 in vessel 38, forming modified clay stream 39. The functionalized halogenated stream 36 and modified clay stream 39 can be combined in vessel 24 to form a functionalized halogenated elastomer / clay nanocomposite. [0115] The halogenation process can result in the formation of acidic species in halogenated elastomer stream 16. Referring to Figures 4 â€” 6, the acidic species can be neutralized at various stages during the processing of the elastomer / clay nanocomposite.<br>
[0116] In one embodiment, as illustrated in Figure 4, neutralization can occur prior to forming the nanocomposite. For example, halogenated elastomer stream 16 can be mixed with neutralizing agent 40 in vessel 42 forming neutralized stream 44. Neutralized stream 44 can be divided into first and second portions 18, 20. In embodiments where a basic solution is desired during the mixing of the first elastomer portion 18 and clay 22, excess neutralizing agent 40 can be fed to vessel 42; alternatively, neutralizing agent can be added to clay slurry 22. In one embodiment, neutralizing agent 40 can be sodium hydroxide. In another embodiment, calcium stearate can be added to the polymer solution during neutralization.<br>
[0117] In another embodiment, as illustrated in Figure 5, neutralization can occur prior to forming the nanocomposite. For example, halogenated elastomer stream 16 can be mixed with neutralizing agent 40 in vessel 42 forming<br><br>
neutralized stream 44. Neutralized stream 44 can be divided into first and second portions 18, 20. First portion 18 can be reacted with functionalizing agent 32 in vessel 34. The resulting functionalized halogenated butyl rubber stream 36 can be recombined with second portion 20 to form mixed butyl rubber stream 45. Butyl rubber stream 45 can be mixed with clay 22 or modified clay stream 39 (if clay 22 is modified by addition of modifying agent 30) in vessel 24, producing nanocomposite stream 28.<br>
[0118] In the embodiment of Figure 6, neutralization can occur after forming the nanocomposite. For example, nanocomposite stream 28 can be mixed with neutralizing agent 40 in vessel 42 forming neutralized nanocomposite stream 44, which can then be recovered using typical halogenated elastomer finishing equipment (not shown).<br>
[0119] hi the embodiment of Figure 7, the first portion 18 can be mixed with clay 22 under acidic conditions, and the neutralization can occur by mixing neutralizing agent 40 in excess in vessel 42.<br>
[0120]       Other   combinations   or   orders   of   adding   neutralizing   agent, functionalization agent, and / or modifying agent can be used. [0121]       The elastomer can be functionalized with an amine, for example, as described above. A functionalized halogenated elastomer, as described above, can exhibit strong ionic interactions, and thus the amount of functionality that may be introduced is limited as a high degree of functionality could lead to gel formation and   to   unprocessable   elastomer.   Because   an  excessively  high  degree  of functionality in the finished product is not desirable, stream 18 can be from 1 to 30% of stream 16; alternatively, stream 18 can be from 5 to 20% of stream 16; alternatively from 8 to 15% of stream 16.   The ionic interaction between the functionalized elastomer and clay surface will stabilize the exfoliated clay, yet the concentration of the functionalized elastomer is low enough to avoid gelation. When mixed back with the base elastomer, the final nanocomposite product can have enhanced barrier properties as well as good processability.<br><br>
 [0122]       Although illustrated by general process steps, one of ordinary skill in the art readily recognizes that additional processing steps and equipment not detailed in the description above may be necessary. Emulsion Processing<br>
[0123]      In the above processes, where clay dispersion 22 is a slurry of<br>
inorganic clay in water, the elastomer / clay nanocomposite stream 26 can be<br>
produced by emulsion processes in a vessel or pump 24. In one embodiment, the<br>
process can comprise mixing an aqueous slurry of inorganic clay with an<br>
elastomer solution (cement). The mixing should be sufficiently vigorous to form<br>
emulsions or micro-emulsions.   In some embodiments, the emulsions can be<br>
formed as an aqueous solution or suspension in an organic solution.   Standard<br>
methods and equipment for both lab and large-scale production, including batch<br>
and continuous processes may be used to produce the elastomeric nanocomposites<br>
of the invention.<br>
[0124] In certain embodiments, a nanocomposite is produced by a process comprising contacting Solution A comprising water and at least one layered filler with Solution B comprising a solvent and at least one elastomer; and removing the solvent and water from the contact product of Solution A and Solution B to form a nanocomposite.<br>
[0125]       In some embodiments, a nanocomposite is produced by a process comprising contacting Solution A comprising water and at least one layered filler with Solution B comprising a solvent and at least one elastomer, wherein the contacting is performed in the presence of an emulsifier or surfactant. [0126]       The emulsions of the present invention are formed by conventional emulsion technology, that is, subjecting a mixture of the hydrocarbon, water and surfactant, when used,  to sufficient shearing, as in a commercial blender or its equivalent for a period of time sufficient for forming the emulsion, e.g., generally a few seconds. For general emulsion information, see generally, "Colloidal Systems and Interfaces", S. Ross and I. D. Morrison, J. W. Wiley, NY, 1988. [0127]       In certain embodiments, the emulsion is formed by subjecting the mixture to agitation using a high-shear mixer.<br><br>
 [0128] When used, the surfactant concentration is sufficient to allow the formation of a relatively stable emulsion. Preferably, the amount of surfactant employed is at least 0.001 wt% of the total emulsion, more preferably about 0.001 to about 3 wt%, and most preferably 0.01 to less than 2 wt%. [0129] Cationic surfactants useful in preparing the emulsions of this invention include tertiary amines, diamines, polyamines, amine salts, as well as quaternary ammonium compounds. Non-ionic surfactants useful in preparing the emulsions of this invention include alkyl ethoxylates, linear alcohol ethoxylates, alkyl glucosides, amide ethoxylates, amine ethoxylates (coco-, tallow-, and oleyl- amine ethoxylates for example), phenol ethoxylates, and nonyl phenol ethoxylates; and the like.<br>
[0130] In other embodiments, a nanocomposite is produced by a process comprising mixing an aqueous slurry of inorganic clay with an elastomer solution wherein the elastomer comprises amine-functionalized monomer unit described by the following:<br><br><br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R10 and R11 are the same or different and are one of a hydrogen, a C1 to C7 alkyl, and primary or secondary alkyl halides; and wherein R2, R3 and R4 are the same or different and are selected from hydrogen, C1 to C20 alkyls, alkenes or aryls, substituted C1 to C20 alkyls, alkenes or aryls,C1 to C20 aliphatic alcohols or ethers, C1to C20 carboxylic acids, nitriles, ethoxylated amines, acrylates, esters and ammonium ions. The functional groups and optional components are as described above in the indicated amounts.<br><br>
 [0131] In one embodiment, the elastomer and fimctionalized amine are combined in a first step, followed by emulsification with an aqueous slurry comprising at least one clay.<br>
[0132] In certain embodiments, at least one of R2, R3 and R4 can be a Ci to â‚¬20 aliphatic alcohols or ethers. In these embodiments, the amine fimctionalized elastomer can act as a self-emulsifier, negating or minimizing the need for additional surfactant or emulsifier to form a stable emulsion, and can enhance the extraction of the clay from the aqueous phase and can promote exfoliation of the clay. In certain embodiments, the functional group can be N-methyldiethanolamine, N,N-dimethylethanolamine, triethanolamine, or combinations thereof or the like.<br>
[0133] By contacting an aqueous clay slurry with organic solution of functionalized elastomers in micro-emulsions, the interaction between the exfoliated clay and elastomers, especially functionalized ionic elastomers, provides a driving force to keep the clay exfoliated in the elastomer matrix (as illustrated in Figure 8), enhancing the exfoliation of the clays and resulting in nanocomposites with improved barrier properties.<br>
[0134]       The nanocomposite formed in the emulsion process above can be<br>
recovered by processes such as, for example, by precipitating the elastomer from<br>
solution, recovering the precipitated elastomer / clay nanocomposite from the<br>
solvent,  antisolvent,   and  water,   and  drying  the  recovered nanocomposite.<br>
Alternatively, the organic solvent can be vaporized with steam and the resulting<br>
elastomer slurry passed through a series of extruders to dry the nanocomposite.<br>
Other processes to recover the nanocomposite can also be used; the scope of the<br>
present invention is not limited to any particular recovery processes.<br>
[0135]      The final composition is formable and curable into such articles as air<br>
barriers, in particular, innertubes and innerliners.<br>
[0136] Suitable solvents used to form the elastomer solution are fully described in WO 02/100935 and WO 02/100936. Preferably the solvent comprises one or more alkanes, alkenes, aromatics, nitrated alkanes, halogenated alkanes, or mixtures thereof. Preferably the solvent comprises one or more C2 to<br><br>
C40 linear branched or cyclic alkanes. Preferably the solvent comprises one or more of hexane, cyclohexane, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, butane, isobutene, pentane, octane isooctane, nonane dodecane or mixtures thereof.<br>
[0137] In the embodiments described above, solvents may be present in the production of the nanocomposite composition from 30 to 99 weight percent, alternatively from 40 to 99 weight percent, alternatively from 50 to 99 weight percent, alternatively from 60 to 99 weight percent, alternatively from 70 to 99 weight percent, alternatively from 80 to 99 weight percent, alternatively from 90 to 99 weight percent, alternatively from 95 to 99 weight percent, alternatively from 70 to 90 weight percent, alternatively from 75 to 90 weight percent, based upon the total weight of the elastomer solution.<br>
[0138] Additionally, in certain embodiments, when two or more solvents are prepared in the production of the nanocomposite composition, each solvent may comprise from 0.1 to 99.9 vol%, alternatively from 1 to 99 vol%, alternatively from 5 to 95 vol%, and alternatively from 10 to 90 vol%, with the total volume of all solvents present at 100 vol%.<br>
[0139] The aqueous slurry of clay and water can be prepared by stirring clay and water at room temperature for a time sufficient to exfoliate the clay. In one embodiment, the clay and water can be stirred for between 0.25 and 24 hours. The clay and water can be stirred for between 4 and 16 hours, or between 10 and 14<br>
hours, in other embodiments.<br>
[0140]       In certain embodiments, when the aqueous slurry of clay is prepared,<br>
the clay can comprise from 0.01 to 40 weight percent of the aqueous slurry,<br>
alternatively from 0.1 to 5.0 weight percent, alternatively from 0.3 to 3.0 weight<br>
percent, based upon the total weight of the slurry.<br>

Permeability Testing<br>
[0146] For each of the following examples, the nanocomposites formed were analyzed for permeability properties using the following method. In certain embodiments, 36 grams of the clay-rubber mixture was loaded into a BrabenderÂ®<br><br>
mixer at a temperature of 130 - 145Â°C and mixed with 20 grams of carbon black (N660) for 7 minutes. The mixture was further mixed with a curatives package of 0.33 g stearic acid, 0.33 g ZnO (Kadox 911 available from C. P. Hall (Chicago, EL)), and 0.33 g MBTS at 40Â°C and 40 rpm for 3 minutes. The resulting rubber compounds were milled, compression molded and cured at 170Â°C. All specimens were compression molded with slow cooling to provide defect free pads.   A compression and curing press was used for rubber samples. Typical thickness of a compression molded pad is around 15 mil (8.1 microns), using an Arbor press, 2" diameter disks were then punched out from molded pads for permeability testing. These disks were conditioned in a vacuum oven at 60Â°C overnight prior to the measurement.   The oxygen permeation measurements were done using a Mocon OX-TRAN 2/61 permeability tester at 40Â°C under the principle of R. A. Pasternak et. al. in 8 JOURNAL OF POLYMER SCIENCE: PART A-2 467 (1970).   Disks thus prepared were mounted on a template and sealed with a vacuum grease.   10 psi (0.07 MPa) nitrogen was kept on one side of the disk, whereas the other side is 10 psi (0.07 MPa) oxygen. Using the oxygen sensor on the nitrogen side, increase in oxygen concentration on the nitrogen side with time could be monitored.   The time  required   for  oxygen  to  permeate  through  the  disk,   or  for  oxygen concentration on the nitrogen side to reach a constant value, is recorded and used to determine the oxygen permeability.   Permeability was measured as oxygen transmission rate on a Mocon WX-TRAN 2/61 at 40Â°C. Where multiple samples were prepared using the same procedure, permeation rates are given for each sample.<br>
