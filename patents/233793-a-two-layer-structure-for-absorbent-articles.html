CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
The present application is a continuation in part of<br>
U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/366,051 filed on<br>
February 13, 2003.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This present invention relates to a two-layer<br>
structure for use in absorbent articles, and more<br>
particularly to a two-layer structure including a fluid<br>
permeable first layer in fluid communication with a fluid<br>
permeable second layer, the second layer including a<br>
plurality of disconnected macrofeatures. The structure is<br>
particularly useful as a cover/transfer layer for use in<br>
absorbent articles.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Transfer layers are commonly used in absorbent<br>
articles to aid in the transport of fluid away from a<br>
bodyfacing layer or cover towards the absorbent core.<br>
Conventional transfer layers are often made of nonwovens.<br>
They typically function by pumping or wicking fluid away<br>
from the body facing layer directly downward into the<br>
underlying absorbent core. Combination cover/transfer<br>
layers are also known. See for example, US Patent Nos.<br>
5,665,082; 5,797,894; and 5,466,232.<br>
Applicants have discovered that a two layer structure<br>
comprising a fluid permeable first layer in fluid<br>
communication with a fluid permeable second layer, said<br>
layers contacting one another at least at the plurality of<br>
disconnected macrofeatures, functions efficiently, among<br>
other things, as a body facing layer or cover/transfer<br>
layer. Upon insult of the first layer of this structure by<br>
a fluid, the structure moves and/or transfers the fluid<br>
both through and across the structure, thereby allowing the<br>
fluid to be transported more quickly through the structure<br>
in the z direction, i.e., through the first and second<br>
layers toward the absorbent core.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to two layer<br>
structures particularly useful in personal care products.<br>
These structures may be used as body-contacting, facing or<br>
cover layers, as transfer or fluid handling layers, or as<br>
other components of personal care products. The structures<br>
of the invention have been found to exhibit improved fluid-<br>
handling properties when used in disposable absorbent<br>
articles such as, for instance, feminine sanitary<br>
protection products.<br>
The first layer, which is in one embodiment a body<br>
contacting layer, may be made from any one of a variety of<br>
fluid permeable materials. As a body contacting layer, the<br>
first layer is preferably compliant, soft feeling, and non-<br>
irritating to a user's skin. The first layer should<br>
further exhibit good strikethrough and a reduced tendency<br>
to rewet, permitting bodily discharges to rapidly penetrate<br>
it and flow toward subsequent underlying layers, while not<br>
allowing such discharges to flow back through the body<br>
contacting layer to the skin of the user.<br>
The first layer may be made from a wide range of<br>
materials including, but not limited to woven or "knitted<br>
fabrics, nonwovens, apertured films, hydro-formed films,<br>
porous foams, reticulated foams, reticulated thermoplastic<br>
films, and thermoplastic scrims. In addition, the first<br>
layer may be constructed from a combination of one or more<br>
of the above materials, such as a composite layer of a<br>
nonwoven and apertured film.<br>
Likewise, the second layer may also be made from a<br>
variety of fluid permeable materials including, but not<br>
limited to woven or knitted fabrics, nonwovens, apertured<br>
films, hydro-formed films, porous foams, reticulated foams,<br>
reticulated thermoplastic films, thermoplastic scrims, and<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
Nonwovens and apertured films are preferred for use as<br>
both the first layer and the second layer. Suitable<br>
nonwovens may be made from any of a variety of fibers as<br>
known in the art. The fibers may vary in length from a<br>
quarter of an inch or less to an inch and a half or more.<br>
It is preferred that when using shorter fibers (including<br>
wood pulp fiber), the short fibers be blended with longer<br>
fibers. The fibers may be any of the well known artificial,<br>
natural or synthetic fibers, such as cotton, rayon, nylon,<br>
polyester, polyolefin, or the like. The nonwoven may be<br>
formed by any of the various techniques known in the art,<br>
such as carding, air laying, wet laying, melt-blowing,<br>
spunbonding and the like.<br>
Apertured films are typically made from a starting<br>
film that is a thin, continuous, uninterrupted film of<br>
thermoplastic polymeric material. This film may be vapor<br>
permeable or vapor impermeable; it may be embossed or<br>
unembossed; it may be corona-discharge treated on one or<br>
both of its major surfaces or it may be free of such<br>
corona-discharge treatment; it may be treated with a<br>
surface active agent after the film is formed by coating,<br>
spraying, or printing the surface active agent onto the<br>
film, or the surface active agent may be incorporated as a<br>
blend into the thermoplastic polymeric material before the<br>
film is formed. The film may comprise any thermoplastic<br>
polymeric material including, but not limited to,<br>
polyolefins, such as high density polyethylene, linear low<br>
density polyethylene, low density polyethylene,<br>
polypropylene; copolymers of olefins and vinyl monomers,<br>
such as copolymers of ethylene and vinyl acetate or vinyl<br>
chloride; polyamides; polyesters; polyvinyl alcohol and<br>
copolymers of olefins and acrylate monomers such as<br>
copolymers of ethylene and ethyl acrylate and<br>
ethylenemethacrylate. Films comprising mixtures of two or<br>
more of such polymeric materials may also be used. The<br>
machine direction (MD) and cross direction (CD) elongation<br>
of the starting film to be apertured should be at least<br>
100% as determined according to ASTM Test No. D-882 as<br>
performed on an Instron test apparatus with a jaw speed of<br>
50 inches/minute (127 cm/minute). The thickness of the<br>
starting film is preferably uniform and may range from<br>
about 0.5 to about 5 mils or about 0.0005 inch (0.0013 cm)<br>
to about 0.005 inch (0.076 cm). Coextruded f.ilms can be<br>
used, as can films that have been modified, e.g., by<br>
treatment with a surface active agent. The starting film<br>
can be made by any known technique, such as casting,<br>
extrusion, or blowing.<br>
Aperturing methods are known in the art. Typically, a<br>
starting film is placed onto the surface of a patterned<br>
support member. The film is subjected to a high fluid<br>
pressure differential while on the support member. The<br>
pressure differential of the fluid, which may be liquid or<br>
gaseous, causes the film to assume the surface pattern of<br>
the patterned support member. Portions of the film<br>
overlying apertures in the support member are ruptured by<br>
the fluid pressure differential to create an apertured<br>
film. A method of forming an apertured fibrous film is<br>
described in detail in commonly owned US 5,827,597 to James<br>
et al., incorporated herein by reference.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, the first<br>
layer and the second layer contact one another<br>
substantially only through a plurality of spaced apart,<br>
disconnected macrofeatures. By this is meant the layers are<br>
joined to one another substantially only at macrofeatures.<br>
The macrofeatures.may be located on the first layer or the<br>
second layer. When the macrofeatures are located on the<br>
first layer, they project in the direction of the second<br>
layer. When the macrofeatures are located on the second<br>
layer, they project in the direction of the first layer.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, the<br>
first layer and the second layer contact one another at the<br>
plurality of spaced apart disconnected macrofeatures and at<br>
selected areas located between the spaced apart,<br>
disconnected macrofeatures.<br>
As used herein, the term "macrofeature" means a<br>
surface projection visible to the normal, unaided human eye<br>
at a perpendicular distance of about 300 mm between the eye<br>
and the surface. Preferably, the macrofeatures each have a<br>
maximum dimension of at least about 0.15 mm. More<br>
preferably, the macrofeatures each have a maximum dimension<br>
of at least about 0.305 mm. Most preferably, the<br>
macrofeatures each have a maximum dimension of at least<br>
about 0.50 mm. The macrofeatures are discrete and<br>
disconnected from one another. That is, if an imaginary-<br>
plane, i.e., a first plane, were lowered onto the first<br>
surface of the three-dimensional layer, it would touch the<br>
layer at the top of the macrofeatures in multiple discrete<br>
areas separated from one another. It is not necessary for<br>
each and every macrofeature to touch the imaginary plane;<br>
rather, the first plane is thus defined by the uppermost<br>
portions of the macrofeatures, that is, those parts of the<br>
macrofeatures projecting the farthest from the second<br>
surface of the layer.<br>
Where the layer with macrofeatures comprises an<br>
apertured film, the film has a first surface, a second<br>
surface, and a caliper defined by a first plane and a<br>
second plane. The film comprises a plurality of<br>
disconnected macrofeatures and a plurality of apertures.<br>
The apertures are defined by sidewalls that originate in<br>
the film's first surface and extend generally in the<br>
direction of the film's second surface to terminate in the<br>
second plane. The first surface of the film is coincident<br>
with the first plane at the disconnected macrofeatures.<br>
Where the layer with macrofeatures comprises a<br>
nonwoven, the nonwoven has a first surface, a second<br>
surface, and a caliper defined by a first plane and a<br>
second plane. The nonwoven further comprises a plurality of<br>
disconnected macrofeatures, wherein the first surface of<br>
the nonwoven is coincident with the first plane at the<br>
disconnected macrofeatures.<br>
In one embodiment, the macrofeatures are arranged in a<br>
regular pattern relative to each other. Moreover, if the<br>
macrofeatures project from a layer that is an apertured<br>
film, the macrofeatures and the apertures are arranged in a<br>
regular configuration relative to each other on said layer.<br>
The apertures and macrofeatures recur at fixed or uniform<br>
intervals with respect to one another. The spatial<br>
relationship between the apertures and the macrofeatures<br>
define a geometric pattern that is consistently repeated<br>
throughout the surface area of the film. The apertures and<br>
macrofeatures are arranged in a regular, defined pattern<br>
uniformly repeated throughout the film.<br>
The apertures and macrofeatures may be arranged so<br>
that there are more apertures than macrofeatures, although<br>
the relative arrangement of apertures and macrofeatures is<br>
regular. The exact sizes and shapes of the apertures and<br>
macrofeatures are not critical, as long as the<br>
macrofeatures are large enough to be visible to a normal<br>
unaided human eye at a distance of about 3 00 mm, and as<br>
long as the macrofeatures are discrete and disconnected<br>
from one another.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
first layer and the second layer contact one another<br>
substantially only though the macrofeatures. That is, the<br>
macrofeatures function much like spacers to hold the first<br>
layer away from the surface of the second layer except<br>
where they contact one another at the macrofeatures.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, the<br>
first layer and the second layer contact one another at the<br>
macrofeatures and at selected areas located between the<br>
spaced macrofeatures. Within the areas defined by the<br>
contacting portions of the macrofeature, the first layer is<br>
arranged above said second layer such that it is spaced<br>
therefrom.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the first<br>
layer comprises a nonwoven, while the second layer<br>
comprises either a nonwoven or an apertured film. The<br>
macrofeatures may be located on either the first layer or<br>
the second layer.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the first layer comprises<br>
an apertured film, while the second layer comprises either<br>
a nonwoven or an apertured film. In this embodiment, the<br>
macrofeatures may also be located on either the first layer<br>
or the second layer. However, when the macrofeatures are<br>
present on the first layer, the macrofeatures on the first<br>
layer preferably contain apertures, i.e., apertured<br>
macrofeatures, and are disconnected from all other<br>
apertured macrofeatures on the first layer. Each apertured<br>
macrofeature is a discrete physical element. FIG. 13 shows<br>
a film of this embodiment, an apertured film with apertured<br>
macrofeatures.<br>
In still another embodiment of the invention, shown in<br>
FIG. 27, the macrofeatures project from the second layer,<br>
which is a three dimensional apertured film as disclosed in<br>
commonly assigned, copending US Application Serial No.<br>
_______ (attorney docket no. CHI-868). Such a second layer<br>
501 can be used in combination with a first layer 500 that<br>
is a nonwoven or an apertured film. Preferably, it is used<br>
in combination with a first layer that is a nonwoven. The<br>
three dimensional apertured film has a first surface and a<br>
second surface. The film additionally has a caliper defined<br>
by a first plane and a second plane. The film has a<br>
plurality of apertures defined by sidewalls that originate<br>
in the first surface and extend generally in the direction<br>
of the second surface to terminate in the second plane. The<br>
film also comprises a plurality of disconnected<br>
macrofeatures 14. The first surface of the film coincides<br>
with the first plane at these macrofeatures.<br>
Figure 1 is a photomicrograph of an embodiment of such<br>
a three-dimensional apertured film. The film 10 of Figure 1<br>
has apertures 12 and macrofeatures 14. The apertures are<br>
defined by sidewalls 15. The macrofeatures are discrete<br>
projections in the film and can be seen to project above<br>
lower regions 16 of the first surface. If an imaginary-<br>
plane, i.e., a first plane, were lowered onto the first<br>
surface of the three-dimensional apertured film, it would<br>
touch the film at the top of the macrofeatures in multiple<br>
discrete areas separated from one another. It is not<br>
necessary for each and every macrofeature to touch the<br>
imaginary plane; rather, the first plane is thus defined by<br>
the uppermost portions of the macrofeatures, that is, those<br>
parts of the macrofeatures projecting the farthest from the<br>
second surface of the film.<br>
In the embodiment of Figure 1, the apertures alternate<br>
with the macrofeatures in both the x-direction and the y-<br>
direction, and the ratio of apertures to macrofeatures is<br>
one.<br>
Figure 1A is an illustration of a cross-section of the<br>
film 10 of Figure 1 along line A-A of Figure 1. As Figure<br>
1A shows, the macrof eatures 14 are disconnected from one<br>
another in first plane 17 and are separated from one<br>
another by lower regions 16 of the first surface of the<br>
film and by apertures 12. The apertures 12 are defined by<br>
sidewalls 15 which originate in the first surface and<br>
extend generally in the direction of the second surface to<br>
terminate in second plane 19. It is not necessary for all<br>
of the apertures to terminate in the second plane 19;<br>
rather, the second plane is defined by the lowermost<br>
extending sidewalls 15.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, at least a portion<br>
of the apertures have sidewalls having a first portion that<br>
originates in the first plane of the film and a second<br>
portion that originates in a plane located between the<br>
first and second planes of the film, that is a plane<br>
intermediate the first and second planes.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, in addition to having<br>
apertures with sidewalls having first portions originating<br>
in the first plane and second portions originating in an<br>
intermediate plane, the film comprises apertures whose<br>
sidewalls originate completely in an intermediate plane.<br>
That is, the film contains apertures that originate in a<br>
plane other than the plane defined by the uppermost surface<br>
of the macrofeatures.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the three-dimensional apertured film comprises a<br>
combination of several different types of apertures. The<br>
film comprises apertures whose sidewalls originate in the<br>
first plane of the film. The film also comprises apertures<br>
having sidewalls, a portion of which originate in the first<br>
plane and a portion of which originate in an intermediate<br>
plane. Finally, the film also comprises apertures whose<br>
sidewalls originate completely in an intermediate plane.<br>
In Figure 2, apertures 12 are defined by sidewalls 15.<br>
The macrofeatures 14 project above lower regions 16 of the<br>
first surface of the film 20. The macrofeatures and<br>
apertures are shaped differently from the macrofeatures and<br>
apertures of the film of Figure 1. In Figure 2, the<br>
macrofeatures are separated from one another by apertures<br>
in the x-direction and in the y-direction. However, some of<br>
the apertures are separated from one another by lower<br>
regions 16 of the first surface in both the x-direction and<br>
the y-direction. In the film. 20 of Figure 2, the ratio of<br>
apertures to macrofeatures is 2.0. Moreover, each aperture<br>
in the film 20 of Figure 2 has a portion of its sidewall<br>
originating in the first plane 17, i.e., at an edge 18 of a<br>
macrofeature, and a portion of its sidewall originating in<br>
a lower region 16 of the first surface.<br>
Figure 2A shows a cross-section of the film 20 of<br>
Figure 2 along line A-A. The macrofeatures 14 are separated<br>
from one another in the first plane 17 by apertures 12,<br>
which are defined by sidewalls 15 that originate in the<br>
first surface of the film and extend generally in the<br>
direction of the second surface to terminate in the second<br>
plane 19. It can be seen in Figure 2A that the portions of<br>
the sidewalls 15 shown in this cross-section originate in<br>
the first plane 17 at the edges 18 of the macrofeatures 14.<br>
Figure 2B shows a cross-section of the film 20 of<br>
Figure 2 taken along line B-B. In this particular cross-<br>
section, no macrofeatures are visible, and the apertures 12<br>
are separated from one another by lower regions 16 of the<br>
first surface of the film. The lower regions 16 of the film<br>
lie between the first plane 17 and the second plane 19,<br>
said planes defining the caliper of the three-dimensional<br>
apertured film shown. The sidewalls 15 terminate in the<br>
second plane 19.<br>
Figure 3 shows a photomicrograph of a further<br>
embodiment of a three-dimensional apertured film with yet<br>
another arrangement of apertures and macrofeatures. The<br>
film 30 of Figure 3 has apertures 12 arranged with<br>
macrofeatures 14, and apertures 22 arranged with<br>
macrofeatures 24. All of the apertures 12, 22 and<br>
macrofeatures 14, 24 are arranged together so that their<br>
relative positions to one another are regular.<br>
Figure 3A is a cross-section of the film 30 of Figure<br>
3 taken along line A-A of Figure 3. This particular cross-<br>
section shows macrofeatures 24 and macrofeatures 14<br>
disconnected from one another in first plane 17 and<br>
separated from one another by apertures 12. The apertures<br>
12 are defined by sidewalls 15 that terminate in the second<br>
plane 19. The portions of the sidewalls 15 shown in this<br>
particular cross-section originate in the first plane 17 at<br>
the edges 18 of the macrofeatures 14 and 24.<br>
Figure 4 is a photomicrograph of yet another<br>
embodiment of a three-dimensional apertured film according<br>
to the present invention. The film 4 0 shown in Figure 4 has<br>
a regular arrangement of apertures 12 and macrofeatures 14.<br>
A suitable starting film for making a three-<br>
dimensional apertured film is a thin, continuous,<br>
uninterrupted film of thermoplastic polymeric material.<br>
This film may be vapor permeable or vapor impermeable; it<br>
may be embossed or unembossed; it may be corona-discharge<br>
treated on one or both of its major surfaces or it may be<br>
free of such corona-discharge treatment; it may be treated<br>
with a surface active agent after the film is formed by<br>
coating, spraying, or printing the surface active agent<br>
onto the film, or the surface active agent may be<br>
incorporated as a blend into the thermoplastic polymeric<br>
material before the film is formed. The film may comprise<br>
any thermoplastic polymeric material including, but not<br>
limited to, polyolefins, such as high density polyethylene,<br>
linear low density polyethylene, low density polyethylene,<br>
polypropylene; copolymers of olefins and vinyl monomers,<br>
such as copolymers of ethylene and vinyl acetate or vinyl<br>
chloride; polyamides; polyesters; polyvinyl alcohol and<br>
copolymers of olefins and acrylate monomers such as<br>
copolymers of ethylene and ethyl acrylate and<br>
ethylenemethacrylate. Films comprising mixtures of two or<br>
more of such polymeric materials may also be used. The<br>
machine direction (MD) and cross direction (CD) elongation<br>
of the starting film to be apertured should be at least<br>
100% as determined according to ASTM Test No. D-882 as<br>
performed on an Instron test apparatus with a jaw speed of<br>
50 inches/minute (127 cm/minute). The thickness of the<br>
starting film is preferably uniform and may range from<br>
about 0.5 to about 5 mils or about 0.0005 inch (0.0013 cm)<br>
to about 0.005 inch (0.076 cm). Coextruded films can be<br>
used, as can films that have been modified, e.g., by<br>
treatment with a surface active agent. The starting film<br>
can be made by any known technique, such as casting,<br>
extrusion, or blowing.<br>
A method of aperturing the film involves placing the<br>
film onto the surface of a patterned support member. The<br>
film is subjected to a high fluid pressure differential as<br>
it is on the support member. The pressure differential of<br>
the fluid, which may be liquid or gaseous, causes the film<br>
to assume the surface pattern of the patterned support<br>
member. If the patterned support member has apertures<br>
therein, portions of the film overlying the apertures may<br>
be ruptured by the fluid pressure differential to create an<br>
apertured film. A method of forming an apertured film is<br>
described in detail in commonly owned US 5,827,597 to James<br>
et al., incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Such a three dimensional apertured film is preferably<br>
formed by placing a thermoplastic film across the surface<br>
of an apertured support member with a pattern of<br>
macrofeatures and apertures. A stream of hot air is<br>
directed against the film to raise its temperature to cause<br>
it to be softened. A vacuum is then applied to the film to<br>
cause it to conform to the shape of the surface of the<br>
support member. Portions of the film lying over the<br>
apertures in the support member are ruptured to create<br>
apertures in the film.<br>
A suitable apertured support member for making these<br>
three-dimensional apertured films is a three-dimensional<br>
topographical support member made by laser sculpting a<br>
workpiece. A schematic illustration of an exemplary<br>
workpiece that has been laser sculpted into a three<br>
dimensional topographical support member is shown in Figure<br>
5.<br>
The workpiece 102 comprises a thin tubular cylinder<br>
110. The workpiece 102 has non-processed surface areas 111<br>
and a laser sculpted center portion 112. A preferred<br>
workpiece for producing the support member of this<br>
invention is a thin-walled seamless tube of acetal, which<br>
has been relieved of all residual internal stresses. The<br>
workpiece has a wall thickness of from 1-8 mm, more<br>
preferably from 2.5-6.5 mm. Exemplary workpieces for use in<br>
forming support members are one to six feet in diameter and<br>
have a length ranging from two to sixteen feet. However,<br>
these sizes are a matter of design choice. Other shapes and<br>
material compositions may be used for the workpiece, such<br>
as acrylics, urethanes, polyesters, high molecular weight<br>
polyethylene and other polymers that can be processed by a<br>
laser beam.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 6, a schematic illustration of<br>
an apparatus for laser sculpting the support member is<br>
shown. A starting blank tubular workpiece 102 is mounted on<br>
an appropriate arbor, or mandrel 121 that fixes it in a<br>
cylindrical shape and allows rotation about its<br>
longitudinal axis in bearings 122. A rotational drive 123<br>
is provided to rotate mandrel 121 at a controlled rate.<br>
Rotational pulse generator 124 is connected to and monitors<br>
rotation of mandrel 121 so that its precise radial position<br>
is known at all times.<br>
Parallel to and mounted outside the swing of mandrel<br>
121 is one or more guide ways 125 that allow carriage 126<br>
to traverse the entire length of mandrel 121 while<br>
maintaining a constant clearance to the top surface 103 of<br>
workpiece 102. Carriage drive 133 moves the carriage along<br>
guide ways 125, while carriage pulse generator 134 notes<br>
the lateral position of the carriage with respect to<br>
workpiece 102. Mounted on the carriage is focusing stage<br>
127. Focusing stage 127 is mounted in focus guide ways 128.<br>
Focusing stage 127 allows motion orthogonal to that of<br>
carriage 126 and provides a means of focusing lens 129<br>
relative to top surface 103. Focus drive 132 is provided to<br>
position the focusing stage 127 and provide the focusing of<br>
lens 129.<br>
Secured to focusing stage 127 is the lens 129, which<br>
is secured in nozzle 130. Nozzle 130 has means 131 for<br>
introducing a pressurized gas into nozzle 13 0 for cooling<br>
and maintaining cleanliness of lens 129. A preferred nozzle<br>
130 for this purpose is described in US Patent 5,756,962 to<br>
James et al. which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Also mounted on the carriage 126 is final bending<br>
mirror 135, which directs the laser beam 136 to the<br>
focusing lens 129. Remotely located is the laser 137, with<br>
optional beam bending mirror 13 8 to direct the beam to<br>
final beam bending mirror 135. While it would be possible<br>
to mount the laser 13 7 directly on carriage 12 6 and<br>
eliminate the beam bending mirrors, space limitations and<br>
utility connections to the laser make remote mounting far<br>
preferable.<br>
When the laser 137 is powered, the beam 136 emitted is<br>
reflected by first beam bending mirror 13 8, then by final<br>
beam bending mirror 135, which directs it to lens 129. The<br>
path of laser beam 136 is configured such that, if lens 129<br>
were removed, the beam would pass through the longitudinal<br>
center line of mandrel 121. With lens 129 in position, the<br>
beam may be focused above, below, at, or near top surface<br>
103.<br>
While this apparatus could be used with a variety of<br>
lasers, the preferred laser is a fast flow CO2 laser,<br>
capable of producing a beam rated at up to 2500 watts.<br>
However, slow flow CO2 lasers rated at 50 watts could also<br>
be used.<br>
Figure 7 is a schematic illustration of the control<br>
system of the laser sculpting apparatus of Figure 6. During<br>
operation of the laser sculpting apparatus, control<br>
variables for focal position, rotational speed, and<br>
traverse speed are sent from a main computer 14 2 through<br>
connection 144 to a drive computer 140. The drive computer<br>
14 0 controls focus position through focusing stage drive<br>
132. Drive computer 140 controls the rotational speed of<br>
the workpiece 102 through rotational drive 123 and<br>
rotational pulse generator 124. Drive computer 140 controls<br>
the traverse speed of the carriage 126 through carriage<br>
drive 133 and carriage pulse generator 134. Drive computer<br>
140 also reports drive status and possible errors to the<br>
main computer 142. This system provides positive position<br>
control and in effect divides the surface of the workpiece<br>
102 into small areas called pixels, where each pixel<br>
consists of a fixed number of pulses of the rotational<br>
drive and a fixed number of pulses of the traverse drive.<br>
The main computer 142 also controls laser 137 through<br>
connection 143.<br>
A laser sculpted three dimensional topographical<br>
support member may be made by several methods. One method<br>
of producing such a support member is by a combination of<br>
laser drilling and laser milling of the surface of a<br>
workpiece.<br>
Methods of laser drilling a workpiece include<br>
percussion drilling, fire-on-the-fly drilling, and raster<br>
scan drilling.<br>
A preferred method is raster scan drilling. In this<br>
approach, the pattern is reduced to a rectangular repeat<br>
element 141 as depicted in FIG. 8. This repeat element<br>
contains all of the information required to produce the<br>
desired pattern. When used like a tile and placed both end-<br>
to-end and side-by-side, the larger desired pattern is the<br>
result.<br>
This repeat element is further divided into a grid of<br>
smaller rectangular units or "pixels" 142. Though typically<br>
square, for some purposes, it may be more convenient to<br>
employ pixels of unequal proportions. The pixels themselves<br>
are dimensionless and the actual dimensions of the image<br>
are set during processing, that is, the width 145 of a<br>
pixel and the length 146 of a pixel are only set during the<br>
actual drilling operation. During drilling, the length of a<br>
pixel is set to a dimension that corresponds to a selected<br>
number of pulses from the carriage pulse generator 134.<br>
Similarly, the width of a pixel is set to a dimension that<br>
corresponds to the number of pulses from the rotational<br>
pulse generator 124. Thus, for ease of explanation, the<br>
pixels are shown to be square in Figure 8; however, it is<br>
not required that pixels be square, but only that they be<br>
rectangular.<br>
Each column of pixels represents one pass of the<br>
workpiece past the focal position of the laser. This column<br>
is repeated as many times as is required to reach<br>
completely around workpiece 102. Each white pixel<br>
represents an off instruction to the laser, that is the<br>
laser is emitting no power, and each black pixel represents<br>
an on instruction to the laser, that is the laser is<br>
emitting a beam. This results in a simple binary file of<br>
1's and 0's where a 1, or white, is an instruction for the<br>
laser to shut off and a 0, or black, is an instruction for<br>
the laser to turn on. Thus, in Figure 8, areas 147, 148 and<br>
149 correspond to instructions for the laser to emit full<br>
power and will result in holes in the workpiece 102.<br>
Referring back to Figure 7, the contents of an<br>
engraving file are sent in a binary form, where 1 is off<br>
and 0 is on, by the main computer 142 to the laser 137 via<br>
connection 143. By varying the time between each<br>
instruction, the duration of the instruction is adjusted to<br>
conform to the size of the pixel. After each column of the<br>
file is completed, that column is again processed, or<br>
repeated, until the entire circumference is completed.<br>
While the instructions of a column are being carried out,<br>
the traverse drive is moved slightly. The speed of traverse<br>
is set so that upon completion of a circumferential<br>
engraving, the traverse drive has moved the focusing lens<br>
the width of a column of pixels and the next column of<br>
pixels is processed. This continues until the end of the<br>
file is reached and the file is again repeated in the axial<br>
dimension until the total desired width is reached.<br>
In this approach, each pass produces a number of<br>
narrow cuts in the material, rather than a large hole.<br>
Because these cuts are precisely registered to line up<br>
side-by-side and overlap somewhat, the cumulative effect is<br>
a hole.<br>
Figure 9 is a photomicrograph of a portion of a<br>
support member that has initially been raster scan drilled<br>
utilizing the file of Figure 8. The surface of the support<br>
member is a smooth planar surface 152 with a series of<br>
nested hexagonal holes 153.<br>
A highly preferred method for making the laser<br>
sculpted three dimensional topographical support members is<br>
through laser modulation. Laser modulation is carried out<br>
by gradually varying the laser power on a pixel by pixel<br>
basis. In laser modulation, the simple on or off<br>
instructions of raster scan drilling are replaced by<br>
instructions that adjust on a gradual scale the laser power<br>
for each individual pixel of the laser modulation file. In<br>
this manner a three dimensional structure can be imparted<br>
to the workpiece in a single pass over the workpiece.<br>
Laser modulation has several advantages over other<br>
methods of producing a three dimensional topographical<br>
support member. Laser modulation produces a one-piece,<br>
seamless, support member without the pattern mismatches<br>
caused by the presence of a seam. With laser modulation,<br>
the support member is completed in a single operation<br>
instead of multiple operations, thus increasing efficiency<br>
and decreasing cost. Laser modulation eliminates problems<br>
with the registration of patterns, which can be a problem<br>
in a multi-step sequential operation. Laser modulation also<br>
allows for the creation of topographical features with<br>
complex geometries over a substantial distance. By varying<br>
the instructions to the laser, the depth and shape of a<br>
feature can be precisely controlled and features that<br>
continuously vary in cross section can be formed. The<br>
regular positions of the apertures and macrofeatures<br>
relative to one another can be maintained.<br>
Referring again to Figure 7, during laser modulation<br>
the main computer 142 may send instructions to the laser<br>
13 7 in other than a simple "on" or "off" format. For<br>
example, the simple binary file may be replaced with an 8<br>
bit (byte) format, which allows for a variation in power<br>
emitted by the laser of 256 possible levels. Utilizing a<br>
byte format, the instruction "11111111" instructs the lase<br>
to turn off, "00000000" instructs the laser to emit full<br>
power, and an instruction such as "10000000" instructs the<br>
laser to emit one-half of the total available laser power.<br>
A laser modulation file can be created in many ways.<br>
One such method is to construct the file graphically using<br>
a gray scale of a 256 color level computer image. In such<br>
gray scale image, black can represent full power and white<br>
can represent no power with the varying levels of gray in<br>
between representing intermediate power levels. A number o<br>
computer graphics programs can be used to visualize or<br>
create such a laser-sculpting file. Utilizing such a file,<br>
the power emitted by the laser is modulated on a pixel by<br>
pixel basis and can therefore directly sculpt a three<br>
dimensional topographical support member. While an 8-bit<br>
byte format is described here, other levels, such as 4 bit<br>
16 bit, 24 bit or other formats can be substituted.<br>
A suitable laser for use in a laser modulation system<br>
for laser sculpting is a fast flow CO2 laser with a power<br>
output of 2500 watts, although a laser of lower power<br>
output could be used. Of primary concern is that the laser<br>
must be able to switch power, levels as quickly as possible.<br>
A preferred switching rate is at least 10 kHz and even more<br>
preferred is a rate of 20 kHz. The high power-switching<br>
rate is needed to be able to process as many pixels per<br>
second as possible.<br>
Figure 10 shows a graphical representation of a laser<br>
modulation file to produce a support member using laser<br>
modulation. The support member made with the file of Figure<br>
10 is used to make the three-dimensional apertured film<br>
shown in Figure 2. In Figure 10, the black areas 154<br>
indicate pixels where the laser is instructed to emit full<br>
power, thereby creating a hole in the support member, which<br>
corresponds to apertures 12 in the three-dimensional<br>
apertured film 20 illustrated in Figure 2. Likewise, white<br>
areas 155 in Figure 10 indicate pixels where the laser<br>
receives instructions to turn off, thereby leaving the<br>
surface of the support member intact. These intact areas of<br>
the support member correspond to the macrofeatures 14 of<br>
the three-dimensional apertured film 20 of Figure 2. The<br>
gray area 156 in Figure 10 indicates pixels where the laser<br>
is instructed to emit partial power and produce a lower<br>
region on the support member. This lower region on the<br>
support member corresponds to lower region 16 on the three-<br>
dimensional apertured film 20 of Figure 2.<br>
Figure 11 shows a graphical representation of a laser<br>
modulation file to produce a support member using laser<br>
modulation. As in the laser-drilling file of Figure 8, each<br>
pixel represents a position on the surface of the<br>
workpiece. Each row of pixels represents a position in the<br>
axial direction of the workpiece to be sculpted. Each<br>
column of pixels represents a position in the<br>
circumferential position of the workpiece. Unlike the file<br>
of Figure 8 however, each of the laser instructions<br>
represented by the pixels is no longer a binary<br>
instruction, but has been replaced by 8 bit or gray scale<br>
instructions. That is, each pixel has an 8-bit value, which<br>
translates to a specific power level.<br>
Figure 11 is a graphical representation of a laser<br>
modulation file to produce a support member using laser<br>
modulation. The file shows a series of nine leaf-like<br>
structures 159, which are shown in white. The leaves are a<br>
series of white pixels and are instructions for the laser<br>
to be off and emit no power. Leaves of these shapes,<br>
therefore, would form the uppermost surface of the support<br>
member after the pattern has been sculpted into it. Each<br>
leaf structure contains a series of six holes 160, which<br>
are defined by the stem-like structures of the leaves and<br>
extend through the thickness of the workpiece. The holes<br>
160 consist of an area of black pixels, which are<br>
instructions for the laser to emit full power and thus<br>
drill through the workpiece. The leaves are discrete<br>
macrofeatures, i.e., by themselves they do not form a flat<br>
planar structure, as no leaf interconnects with any other<br>
leaf. The background pattern of this structure consists of<br>
a close-packed staggered pattern of hexagonal black areas<br>
161, which are also instructs for the laser to emit full<br>
power and drill a hole through the workpiece. The field<br>
162, which defines holes 161, is at a laser power level<br>
that is neither fully on nor fully off. This produces a<br>
second planar area, which is below the uppermost surface of<br>
the workpiece as defined by the off instructions of the<br>
white areas of the leaves.<br>
Figure 12 is a photomicrograph of a laser sculpted<br>
three dimensional topographical support member produced by<br>
laser modulation utilizing the laser modulation file<br>
depicted in Figure 11. Figure 12A is a cross-sectional view<br>
of the support member of Figure 12. Regions 159' of Figure<br>
12 and 159" of Figure 12A correspond to the leaf 159 of<br>
Figure 11. The white pixel instructions of areas 159 of<br>
Figure 11 have resulted in the laser emitting no power<br>
during the processing of those pixels. The top surface of<br>
the leaves 159' and 159" correspond to the original surface<br>
of the workpiece. Holes 160' in Figure 12 correspond to the<br>
black pixel areas 160 of Figure 11, and in processing these<br>
pixels the laser emits full power, thus cutting holes<br>
completely through the workpiece. The background film 162'<br>
of Figure 12 and 162" of Figure 12A correspond to the pixel<br>
area 162 of Figure 11. Region 162' results from processing<br>
the pixels of Figure 11 with the laser emitting partial<br>
power. This produces an area in the support member that is<br>
lower than the original surface of the workpiece and that<br>
is thus lower than the top surface of the leaves.<br>
Accordingly, the individual leaves are discrete<br>
macrofeatures, unconnected to each other.<br>
Figures 13 and 13A are photomicrographs of a three-<br>
dimensional apertured film that has been produced on the<br>
support member of Figures 12 and 12A. The apertured film<br>
has raised apertured leaf-shaped macrofeatures 176 and<br>
176', which correspond to the leaves 159' and 159" of the<br>
support member of Figures 12 and 12A. Each of the leaves is<br>
discrete and disconnected from all the other leaves. Each<br>
leaf contains apertures, i.e., each leaf is an apertured<br>
macrofeature. The plane defined by the uppermost surfaces<br>
of all the leaf shaped regions 176 and 176' is the<br>
uppermost surface of a plurality of disconnected<br>
macrofeatures. The background apertured regions 177 and<br>
177' define a region that is at a lower depth in the film<br>
than the leaf shaped regions. This gives the visual<br>
impression that the leaves are embossed into the film.<br>
The laser sculpted support members of Figures 9, 12,<br>
and 12A have simple geometries. That is, successive cross-<br>
sections, taken parallel to the uppermost surface of the<br>
support member, are essentially the same for a significant<br>
depth through the thickness of the support member. For<br>
example, referring to Figure 9, successive cross-sections<br>
of this support member taken parallel to the surface of the<br>
support member are essentially the same for the thickness<br>
of the support member. Similarly, cross-sections of the<br>
support member of Figures 12 and 12A are essentially the<br>
same for the depth of the leaves and are essentially the<br>
same from the base of the leaves through the thickness of<br>
the support member.<br>
Figure 14 is a graphical representation of another<br>
laser modulation file to produce a laser sculpted support<br>
member using laser modulation. The file contains a central<br>
floral element 178 and four elements 179, each of which<br>
constitutes a quarter of a floral element 178, which<br>
combine when the file is repeated during laser sculpting.<br>
Figure 14A is a 3 repeat by 3 repeat graphical<br>
representation of the resulting pattern when the file of<br>
Figure 14 is repeated.<br>
Figure 15 is a magnified view of the area B of Figure<br>
14. The gray area represents a region of pixels instructing<br>
the laser to emit partial power. This produces a planar<br>
area below the surface of the workpiece. Contained in gray<br>
region 180 is a series of black areas 181 which are pixels<br>
instructing the laser to emit full power and drill a series<br>
of hexagonal shaped holes through the thickness of the<br>
workpiece. Central to Figure 15 is the floral element<br>
corresponding to the floral element 178 of Figure 14. The<br>
floral element consists of a center region 183 and six<br>
petal shaped regions 182 which again represent instructions<br>
for the laser to emit full power and drill a hole through<br>
the thickness of the workpiece. Defining the outside edge<br>
of the center region 183 is region 184. Defining the<br>
outside edge of the petal regions 182 is region 184'.<br>
Regions 184 and 184' represent a series of instructions for<br>
the laser to modulate the emitted power. The central black<br>
region 183 and its outside edge region 184 are joined to<br>
the region 184' by region 185 which represents instructions<br>
for the laser to emit the same power level as the<br>
background area 180.<br>
Figure 16 is.an enlarged graphical representation of<br>
portion C of region 184 of Figure 15 which forms the<br>
outline of the center region 183 of Figure 15. The portion<br>
C contains a single row of white pixels 186 which instruct<br>
the laser to turn off. This defines part of the uppermost<br>
surface of the support member that remains after<br>
processing. The rows of pixels 187 and 187' instruct the<br>
laser to emit partial power. The rows 188, 189, 190, and<br>
191 and the rows 188', 189' 190', and 191' instruct the<br>
laser to emit progressively increased levels of power. Rows<br>
192 and 192' instruct the laser to emit the power level<br>
also represented by region 185 of Figure 15. Rows 194,<br>
194', and 194" instruct the laser to emit full power and<br>
form part of region 183 of Figure 15.<br>
As each column of Figure 16 is processed the laser<br>
emits the partial power represented by rows 192 and 192'.<br>
Rows 191, 190, 189, 188, and 187 instruct the laser to<br>
progressively decrease the power emitted, until row 186 is<br>
processed and the laser is instructed to not emit power.<br>
The rows 187', 188', 189', 190', and 191' then instruct the<br>
laser to again progressively increase the power emitted.<br>
Rows 194, 194', and 194" instruct the laser to again emit<br>
full power to begin drilling through the workpiece. This<br>
results in the creation of a disconnected macrofeature,<br>
which slopes from the background plane to the surface of<br>
the workpiece and then slopes back to the hole area, thus<br>
producing a radiused shape.<br>
Depending on the size of the pixels as defined during<br>
processing, and the variation in emitted laser power for<br>
each row, the size and shape of the resulting laser<br>
sculpted feature can be changed. For example, if the<br>
variation in power level for each row of pixels is small,<br>
then a relatively shallow rounded shape is produced;<br>
conversely, if the variation in power level for each row of<br>
pixels is greater, then a deep, steep shape with a more<br>
triangular cross-section is produced. Changes in pixel size<br>
also affect the geometry of the features produced. If the<br>
pixel size is kept smaller than the actual diameter of the<br>
focused laser beam emitted, then smooth blended shapes will<br>
be produced.<br>
Figure 17 is a photomicrograph of the laser sculpted<br>
support member resulting from the processing of the file of<br>
Figure 14 by laser modulation. The photomicrograph shows a<br>
raised floral element 195, which corresponds to the floral<br>
element 178 of Figure 14 and the floral element of Figure<br>
15. The photomicrograph also shows portions of additional<br>
floral elements 195'. Raised floral element 195 originates<br>
in the planar region 196, which contains holes 197. Floral<br>
elements 195 and 195' are disconnected from one another and<br>
thus do not form a continuous planar region.<br>
Figure 18 is an enlarged photomicrograph of a portion<br>
of the floral element 195 of Figure 17. The center circular<br>
element 198 is the area produced by the laser modulation<br>
instructions contained in region 184 of Figure 15. The<br>
elements 199 are parts of the petal elements of the floral<br>
element 195 of Figure 17. These petal elements are produced<br>
by pixel instructions depicted in region 184' of Figure 15.<br>
These elements demonstrate an example of a type of complex<br>
geometry that can be created by laser modulation. The<br>
central circular element has a semicircular cross section.<br>
That is, any one of a series of cross-sectional planes<br>
taken parallel to the original surface of the workpiece,<br>
i.e., through the depth will differ from any other of such<br>
cross-sectional planes.<br>
Figure 19 is a photomicrograph of the upper surface of<br>
a film produced on the support member of Figure 17. The<br>
film has an apertured planar area 200, containing holes 201<br>
that corresponds to planar region 196 of Figure 17.<br>
Extending above the planar area are floral areas 2 02 and<br>
202', which correspond to floral elements 195 and 195',<br>
respectively, of Figure 17. The floral areas 202 and 202'<br>
give the resulting apertured film an embossed appearance in<br>
a single operation. In addition, the floral areas define<br>
additional larger holes 2 03 and 2 04 to improve fluid<br>
transmission properties.<br>
Figure 20 is an enlargement of the floral area 2 02 of<br>
Figure 19. The floral area comprises hole 204 and the<br>
surrounding circular element 205. Element 205 of Figures 19<br>
and 20 has a complex geometry in that it has a semicircular<br>
cross-section. Again, successive cross-sections taken<br>
parallel to the surface of the film taken through its depth<br>
are different.<br>
Upon completion of the laser sculpting of the<br>
workpiece, it can be assembled into the structure shown in<br>
Figure 21 for use as a support member. Two end bells 235<br>
are fitted to the interior of the workpiece 236 with laser<br>
sculpted area 237. These end bells can be shrink-fit,<br>
press-fit, attached by mechanical means such as straps 238<br>
and screws 239 as shown; or by other mechanical means. The<br>
end bells provide a method to keep the workpiece circular,<br>
to drive the finished assembly, and to fix the completed<br>
structure in the aperturing apparatus.<br>
A preferred apparatus for producing such three<br>
dimensional apertured films is schematically depicted in<br>
Figure 22. As shown here, the support member is a rotatable<br>
drum 753. In this particular apparatus, the drum rotates in<br>
a counterclockwise direction. Positioned outside drum 753<br>
is a hot air nozzle 759 positioned to provide a curtain of<br>
hot air to impinge directly on the film supported by the<br>
laser sculpted support member. Means is provided to retract<br>
hot air nozzle 759 to avoid excessive heating of the film<br>
when it is stopped or moving at slow speed. Blower 757 and<br>
heater 758 cooperate to supply hot air to nozzle 759.<br>
Positioned inside the drum 753, directly opposite the<br>
nozzle 759, is vacuum head 760. Vacuum head 760 is radially<br>
adjustable and positioned so as to contact the interior<br>
surface of drum 753. A vacuum source 761 is provided to<br>
continuously exhaust vacuum head 760.<br>
Cooling zone 762 is provided in the interior of and<br>
contacting the inner surface of drum 753. Cooling zone 762<br>
is provided with cooling vacuum source 763. In cooling zone<br>
762, cooling vacuum source 763 draws ambient air through<br>
the apertures made in the film to set the pattern created<br>
in the aperturing zone. Vacuum source 763 also provide<br>
means of holding the film in place in cooling zone 762 in<br>
drum 753, and provides means to isolate the film from the<br>
effects of tension produced by winding up the film after<br>
its aperturing.<br>
Placed on top of laser sculpted support member 753 is<br>
a thin, continuous, uninterrupted film 751 of thermoplastic<br>
polymeric material.<br>
An enlargement of the circled area of Figure 22 is<br>
shown in Figure 23. As shown in this embodiment, vacuum<br>
head 76 0 has two vacuum slots 764 and 765 extending across<br>
the width of the film. However, for some purposes, it may<br>
be preferred to use separate vacuum sources for each vacuum<br>
slot. As shown in Figure 23, vacuum slot 764 provides a<br>
hold down zone for the starting film as it approaches air<br>
knife 758. Vacuum slot 764 is connected to a source of<br>
vacuum by a passageway 766. This anchors the incoming film<br>
751 securely to drum 753 and provides isolation from the<br>
effects of tension in the incoming film induced by the<br>
unwinding of the film. It also flattens film 751 on the<br>
outer surface of drum 753. The second vacuum slot 765<br>
defines the vacuum aperturing zone. Immediately between<br>
slots 764 and 765 is intermediate support bar 768. Vacuum<br>
head 760 is positioned such that the impingement point of<br>
hot air curtain 767 is directly above intermediate support<br>
bar 768. The hot air is provided at a sufficient<br>
temperature, a sufficient angle of incidence to the film,<br>
and at a sufficient distance from the film to cause the<br>
film to become softened and deformable by a force applied<br>
thereto. The geometry of the apparatus ensures that the<br>
film 751, when softened by hot air curtain 767, is isolated<br>
from tension effects by hold-down slot 764 and cooling zone<br>
762 (Figure 22). Vacuum aperturing zone 765 is immediately<br>
adjacent hot air curtain 767, which minimizes the time that<br>
the film is hot and prevents excessive heat transfer to<br>
support member 753.<br>
Referring to Figures 22 and 23, a thin flexible film<br>
751 is fed from a supply roll 750 over idler roll 752. Roll<br>
752 may be attached to a load cell or other mechanism to<br>
control the feed tension of the incoming film 751. The film<br>
751 is then placed in intimate contact with the support<br>
member 753. The film and support member then pass to vacuum<br>
zone 764. In vacuum zone 764 the differential pressure<br>
further forces the film into intimate contact with support<br>
member 753. The vacuum pressure then isolates the film from<br>
the supply tension. The film and support member combination<br>
then passes under hot air curtain 767. The hot air curtain<br>
heats the film and support member combination, thus<br>
softening the film.<br>
The heat-softened film and the support member<br>
combination then pass into vacuum zone 765 where the heated<br>
film is deformed by the differential pressure and assumes<br>
the topography of the support member. The heated film areas<br>
that are located over open areas in the support member are<br>
further deformed into the open areas of the support member.<br>
If the heat and deformation force are sufficient, the film<br>
over the open areas of the support member is ruptured to<br>
create apertures.<br>
The still-hot apertured film and support member<br>
combination then passes to cooling zone 762. In the cooling<br>
zone a sufficient quantity of ambient air is pulled through<br>
the now-apertured film to cool both the film and the<br>
support member.<br>
The cooled film is then removed from the support<br>
member around idler roll 754. Idler roll 754 may be<br>
attached to a load cell or other mechanism to control<br>
winding tension. The apertured film then passes to finish<br>
roll 756, where it is wound up.<br>
Figure 24 is a photomicrograph of an apertured film<br>
800 of the prior art that was produced on a support member<br>
that has been raster scan drilled utilizing the file of<br>
Figure 9. The surface of this apertured film is a planar<br>
surface 852 with a series of nested hexagonal holes 853.<br>
Figure 2 5 is a photomicrograph of another apertured<br>
film of the prior art that was produced on another support<br>
member that was produced by raster scan drilling. The<br>
surface of this apertured film is also characterized by a<br>
planar surface and a series of nested hexagonal holes that<br>
are larger than those shown in Figure 24.<br>
Figure 26 is a photomicrograph of a further embodiment<br>
of a three-dimensional apertured film of the present<br>
invention with an arrangement of apertures and<br>
macrofeatures. The film 880 of Figure 26 has apertures 12<br>
arranged with macrofeatures 14. All of the apertures 12 and<br>
macrofeatures 14 are arranged together so that their<br>
relative positions to one another are regular.<br>
While the method of forming a three dimensional<br>
apertured film has been described using a hot air curtain<br>
as the mechanism to heat the film, any suitable method such<br>
as infrared heating, heated rolls, or the like may be<br>
employed to produce an apertured film using the laser<br>
sculpted three-dimensional topographical support member of<br>
this invention.<br>
In another method for producing an apertured film the<br>
incoming film supply system can be replaced with a suitable<br>
extrusion system. In this case the extrusion system<br>
provides a film extrudate; which, depending on the<br>
extrudate temperature, can either be cooled to a suitable<br>
temperature by various means such as cold air blast or<br>
chilled roll prior to contacting the three dimensional<br>
topographical support or be brought in direct contact with<br>
the three dimensional topographical support. The film<br>
extrudate and forming surface are then subjected to the<br>
same vacuum forming forces as described above without the<br>
need to heat the film to soften the film to make it<br>
deformable.<br>
Figure 27 is a cross-section of a two layer structure<br>
according to the invention. The structure comprises a body<br>
contacting layer 500, in this case a nonwoven, overlying a<br>
second layer 501, also a nonwoven. Second layer 501<br>
comprises a plurality of macrofeatures 14 projecting in the<br>
direction of the body contacting layer 500. The second<br>
layer 501 may be secured to the body contacting layer 500<br>
using a suitable adhesive known to those skilled and then<br>
passing the two layer structure through a nip roll or the<br>
like.<br>
Figure 29 is a photomicrograph of a portion of an<br>
apertured film 300 produced in accordance with the<br>
invention. Figure 30 is a partially cut away perspective<br>
view of a two layer structure 400 according to the<br>
invention. As shown, the structure 400 includes a body<br>
contacting layer 3 01, in this case a nonwoven, overlying a<br>
second layer 300, in this case the apertured film 300 shown<br>
in Figure 29.<br>
The second layer 300 comprises a substantially planar<br>
area 303 having a first surface 308, opposed second surface<br>
310 and a plurality of apertures 311 extending from the<br>
first surface 308 to the second surface 310.<br>
The second layer 300 further includes a plurality of<br>
substantially oval macrofeatures 312 projecting from the<br>
first surface 308 of the planar area 303 in the direction<br>
of the body contacting layer 302. The second layer also<br>
includes a central circular macrofeature 314. The<br>
substantially oval macrofeatures 312 are arranged in an<br>
array around the circular macrofeature 314 such that the<br>
macrofeatures 312 and macrofeature 314 collectively give<br>
the visual appearance of a flower. In this manner,<br>
macrofeatures 312 and 314 cooperate to define a visual<br>
design element.<br>
Although only a single "flower" is depicted in Figure<br>
29, it is understood that Fig. 29 only shows a portion of<br>
the apertured film and the complete apertured film would<br>
preferably include a plurality of such "flower" designs by<br>
having plurality of the oval macrofeatures 312 and a<br>
plurality of the circular macrofeatures 314 to give the<br>
appearance of a plurality of such "flowers". Likewise,<br>
Figure 30 only depicts a portion of a two layer structure<br>
according to the invention and the complete two layer<br>
structure would preferably include a plurality of such<br>
flower designs. Moreover, although a flower design has<br>
been depicted as the visual design element it will be<br>
apparent that numerous other design elements could be<br>
created using macrofeatures of the type disclosed herein.<br>
Fig. 31 is a cross-section view of an absorbent<br>
article 410 including the two layer structure 400 shown in<br>
Fig. 29, taken along line 31-31. The absorbent article 410<br>
further includes an absorbent core 412 that is in fluid<br>
communication with the two layer structure 400.<br>
As best seen in Fig. 31, in those areas of the two<br>
layer structure 400 that are located outside the<br>
macrofeatures 312 and 314, the second layer 300 is<br>
substantially in surface to surface contact with body<br>
contacting layer 301 as shown. Further, the second layer<br>
300 contacts the body contacting layer 301 at each one of<br>
the plurality of macrofeatures 312 and 314.<br>
In the areas defined within the macrofeatures 312 and<br>
314, i.e. within the areas designated 318 and 320<br>
respectively, the body contacting layer 3 01 is arranged in<br>
a first substantially planar plane A and the second layer<br>
300 is arranged in a second substantially planar plane B<br>
that is spaced from the first plane A. In<br>
this manner, in those areas defined within macrofeatures<br>
312 and 314, the body contacting layer 301 is arranged in<br>
spaced relationship relative to the second layer 300.<br>
The two layer structure 4 00 shown in Figure 3 0 is<br>
preferably formed as vacuum formed laminate using the<br>
process as substantially shown and described in U.S. Patent<br>
6,303,208, the subject matter of which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference. The specific technique used to form<br>
the two layer structure 400 will be described with<br>
reference to Figure 32. Figure 32 is a simplified<br>
schematic illustration showing a process to adhere a<br>
fibrous carrier material 900 (e.g. a nonwoven) onto a<br>
molten or semi-molten film material having a top surface<br>
904 and a bottom surface 906. The fibrous material 900 is<br>
applied through a nip roll 911 to form the two layer<br>
laminate structure 600.<br>
As shown, the film material 902 is dispensed from a<br>
film die 920 onto the support member 753. The film<br>
material 902 is delivered at an elevated temperature. The<br>
film material 902 is formed and perforated by passing the<br>
material over the support member 753 and applying a<br>
pressure differential by a vacuum head 760. As the film<br>
material 901 is extruded from the die 920 the film material<br>
comes into contact with the rotating surface of the support<br>
member 753. The rotating surface of the support member 753<br>
moves continues portions of the film material across the<br>
vacuum head 760 such that the film is deformed to assume<br>
the topography of the support member 753.<br>
The fibrous material 900 has first surface 940, which<br>
is brought into contact with the top surface of the film<br>
904 of the film 902. The fibrous material 10 has a second<br>
surface 942 that is opposed to the first surface 904. A<br>
dispensing means 946 transfers the fibrous material 900 to<br>
an impingement or lamination point 94 8 where the fibrous<br>
material 900 and film material 902 contact each other to<br>
form the laminate.4 00. In the embodiment shown, the<br>
fibrous material 900 contacts the film 902 at the<br>
impingement point 94 8 prior to the leading edge 931 of the<br>
vacuum head 760. After passing under the impingement point<br>
948 the film material 902 and fibrous material 900 pass<br>
over the vacuum chamber to thereby define the apertures and<br>
macrofeatures in the film material 902.<br>
The two layer structures described above may<br>
advantageously be used as a cover/transfer layer of an<br>
absorbent article, such as a sanitary napkin, pantiliner,<br>
diaper, incontinence pad, or other similar product for<br>
absorbing exudates from the body, such as menses, urine,<br>
feces, or sweat. Preferably, the absorbent article is a<br>
sanitary napkin or a pantiliner. Such sanitary napkin or<br>
pantiliner may have an approximately rectangular, oval,<br>
dogbone, or peanut shape. Depending on the nature of the<br>
absorbent article, its size may vary. For example,<br>
sanitary napkins typically have a caliper of about 1.4 to<br>
about 5 mm, a length of about 8 to about 41 centimeters<br>
(cm), and a width of about 2.5 to about 13 cm. Pantiliners<br>
typically have a caliper of less than about 5 mm, a length<br>
of less than about 20 cm, and a width of less than about 8<br>
cm.<br>
The two layer structures described above are<br>
preferably placed over a suitable absorbent core, which is<br>
typically comprised of a loosely associated absorbent<br>
hydrophilic material such as cellulose fibers, including<br>
wood pulp, regenerated cellulose fibers or cotton fibers,<br>
or other absorbent materials generally known in the art,<br>
including acrylic fibers, polyvinyl alcohol fibers, peat<br>
moss and superabsorbent polymers.<br>
The absorbent article may further comprise a backsheet<br>
that is substantially or completely impermeable to liquids,<br>
the exterior of which forms the garment-facing surface of<br>
the article. The backsheet may comprise any thin,<br>
flexible, body fluid impermeable material such as a<br>
polymeric film, for example, polyethylene, polypropylene,<br>
or cellophane. Alternatively, the backsheet may be a<br>
normally fluid permeable material that has been treated to<br>
be impermeable, such as impregnated fluid repellent paper<br>
or non-woven fabric material, or a flexible foam, such as<br>
polyurethane or cross-linked polyethylene. The thickness<br>
of the backsheet when formed from a polymeric film<br>
typically is about 0.025 mm to 0.051 mm. A variety of<br>
materials are known in the art for use as backsheet, and<br>
any of these may be used. The backsheet may be breathable,<br>
i.e., a film that is a barrier to liquids but permits gases<br>
to transpire. Materials for this purpose include<br>
microporous films in which microporosity is created by<br>
stretching an oriented film. Single or multiple layers of<br>
permeable films, fabrics, and combinations thereof that<br>
provide a tortuous path, and/or whose surface<br>
characteristics provide a liquid surface repellent to the<br>
penetration of liquids may also be used to provide a<br>
breathable backsheet.<br>
A cross-sectional view of an absorbent article<br>
comprising a two layer structure according to the invention<br>
is shown in Figure 28. The two layer structure is used as<br>
a cover/transfer layer. The absorbent article comprises a<br>
backsheet 503. Overlying the backsheet is an absorbent<br>
core 502. Overlying the absorbent core is the two layer<br>
structure 504. Two layer structure 504 comprises a<br>
nonwoven first or body contacting layer 500 over a second<br>
layer 501 that is an apertured film. The apertured film<br>
comprises a disconnected macrofeatures 14 and apertures 12.<br>
The absorbent article may comprise other known<br>
materials, layers, and additives, such as adhesives,<br>
release paper, foam layers, net-like layers, perfumes,<br>
medicaments, moisturizers, and the like, many examples of<br>
which are known in the art.<br>
Examples<br>
Structures of the present invention comprising a fluid<br>
permeable first layer in fluid communication with a fluid<br>
permeable second layer, wherein the layers contact one<br>
another substantially only through a plurality of<br>
disconnected macrofeatures have favorable fluid handling<br>
properties. In particular, disposable absorbent products<br>
with a component layer having a plurality of disconnected<br>
macrofeatures have a low Fluid Penetration time.<br>
Additionally, disposable absorbent products comprising<br>
apertured film having a plurality of disconnected<br>
macrofeatures exhibit a Repeat Insult Time that increases<br>
less than about 40% over six insults.<br>
Structures according to the present invention<br>
comprising an apertured film having a plurality of<br>
disconnected macrofeatures (Examples 1, 2, and 3) and<br>
structures containing samples of conventional) apertured<br>
film (Prior Art 1 and 2 were compared as transfer layers<br>
using the Fluid Penetration Test and the Repeat Insult<br>
Test. The test fluid used for the Fluid Penetration Test<br>
and the Repeat Insult Test was a synthetic menstrual fluid<br>
having a viscosity of 30 centipoise at 1 radian per second.<br>
Test assemblies were made from Examples 1-3 and Prior<br>
Art 1 and 2 using cover layer, absorbent core and barrier<br>
from the commercially available sanitary napkin, Stayfree<br>
Ultra Thin Long with Wings, distributed by Personal<br>
Products Company Division of McNeil-PPC, Inc. Skillman, NJ.<br>
The cover layer is a thermally bonded polypropylene fabric;<br>
the absorbent core is a material containing superabsorbent<br>
polymer and the barrier is a pigmented polyethylene film.<br>
The cover layer and transfer layers were each carefully<br>
peeled away from the product exposing the absorbent core<br>
which remained adhesively attached to the barrier film.<br>
Next, a piece of transfer layer material to be tested was<br>
cut to a size approximately 200 mm long by at least the<br>
width of the absorbent core and a pressure sensitive hot<br>
melt adhesive such as HL-1471xzp commercially available<br>
from HB Fuller Corporation, St. Paul, MN 55110, was applied<br>
to the side of the transfer layer material oriented<br>
adjacent to the exposed surface of the absorbent core.<br>
Adhesive was applied to the material to be tested by<br>
transfer from release paper which was coated with<br>
approximately 1.55 gram per square meter. The transfer<br>
layer material to be tested was oriented with adhesive side<br>
toward the absorbent core and placed on top of the<br>
absorbent core. To complete the test assembly, the cover<br>
layer was placed over the transfer layer material to be<br>
tested.<br>
Another structure according to the invention (Example 4)<br>
was also tested using the Fluid Penetration Test. This<br>
structure comprised a nonwoven layer with a plurality of<br>
disconnected macrofeatures. This structure was made as<br>
follows. Both the body-contacting layer and the second<br>
layer comprised nonwovens. The body-contacting layer<br>
comprised a point bonded nonwoven comprising a blend of 40%<br>
3 denier and 6 0% 6 denier polypropylene staple fibers with<br>
a basis weight of 34 grams per square meter (gsm). The<br>
second layer in this example was made from a 3 0 gsm<br>
starting nonwoven comprising a blend of 50% polyester<br>
fibers and 50% bicomponent fibers having a sheath of co-<br>
polyester around a polyester core, and available from<br>
Libeltex n.v. in Meulebeke, Belgium.<br>
Discrete macrofeatures were formed on the appropriate<br>
nonwoven layer by heat shaping the starting nonwoven with a<br>
metal plate having a regular, repeating pattern of<br>
truncated cones. The heat shaping of the starting nonwoven<br>
was accomplished by placing the starting nonwoven between<br>
the metal plate and a 6.35 mm thick rubber back-up surface<br>
and pressing at a pressure of 3 0.1 kg force per square<br>
centimeter and a temperature of 107°C for 15 seconds. The<br>
metal plate had a repeating pattern of truncated cones in<br>
staggered rows on 6.36 mm centers. Each cone was<br>
approximately 3.5 mm in diameter at its base and 1.2 mm in<br>
diameter at its top and 2.8 mm high. The heat shaping<br>
created discrete macrofeatures on the surface of the<br>
nonwoven.<br>
When the body-contacting layer was placed over the<br>
second layer with the macrofeatures projecting in the<br>
direction of the body-facing layer, the two layers<br>
contacted each other substantially only through the<br>
macrofeatures in the second layer.<br>
This two-layer structure was placed over an absorbent<br>
core material comprising wood pulp and superabsorbent<br>
polymer, such as that described in US 5,916,670 to Tan et<br>
al., which is incorporated herein by reference. The two-<br>
layer structure was placed against the absorbent core<br>
material with the second layer facing the absorbent core<br>
material. A fluids impermeable barrier layer was placed on<br>
the opposite surface of the absorbent core material to form<br>
an absorbent article for use in absorbing body fluids, such<br>
as, for example, menstrual fluid.<br>
As a comparison, a two layer structure comprising the<br>
same nonwoven layers, but neither layer comprising<br>
macrofeatures (Example 4 Control), was also subjected to<br>
the Fluid Penetration Test.<br>
Table 1 describes commercial products tested and the<br>
absorbent test assemblies made using examples of the<br>
present invention and examples representing prior art.<br>
It has been found that structures of the present invention<br>
comprising three-dimensional apertured films or nonwovens<br>
with a plurality of disconnected macrofeatures have<br>
improved fluid handling properties. In particular, the<br>
structures had a low Fluid Penetration Time when used as a<br>
component layer in disposable absorbent products.<br>
Additionally, the structures comprising three-dimensional<br>
apertured films exhibited a Repeat Insult Rate that<br>
increases less than about 40% over six insults.<br>
Fluid Penetration Time and Repeat Insult Time are<br>
measured according to the following test methods,<br>
respectively. Testing was performed in a location<br>
conditioned to 21 degrees centigrade and 65% relative<br>
humidity. Prior to performing the tests, the commercial<br>
samples and test assemblies were conditioned at for at<br>
least 8 hours.<br>
Fluid Penetration Time (FPT) is measured by placing a<br>
sample to be tested under a Fluid Penetration Test orifice<br>
plate. The orifice plate consists of a 7.6 cm X 25.4 cm<br>
plate of 1.3 cm thick polycarbonate with an elliptical<br>
orifice in its center. The elliptical orifice measures 3.8<br>
cm along its major axis and 1.9 cm along its minor axis.<br>
The orifice plate is centered on the sample to be tested. A<br>
graduated 10 cc syringe containing 7 ml of test fluid is<br>
held over the orifice plate such that the exit of the<br>
syringe is approximately 3 inches above the orifice. The<br>
syringe is held horizontally, parallel to the surface of<br>
the test plate, the fluid is then expelled from the syringe<br>
at a rate that allows the fluid to flow in a stream<br>
vertical to the test plate into the orifice and a stop<br>
watch is started when the fluid first touches the sample to<br>
be tested. The stop watch is stopped when the surface of<br>
the sample first becomes visible within the orifice. The<br>
elapsed time on the stop watch is the Fluid Penetration<br>
Time. The average Fluid Penetration Time(FPT) is calculated<br>
from the results of testing five samples.<br>
The Repeat Insult Time is measured by placing a sample<br>
to be tested on a Resilient Cushion, covering the sample<br>
with a Repeat Insult Orifice Plate, then applying test<br>
fluid according to the schedule described.<br>
The Resilient Cushion is made as follows: a nonwoven<br>
fabric of low density (0.03-0.0 g/cm3, measured at 0.24 kPa<br>
or 0.035 psi) is used as a resilient material. The<br>
nonwoven fabric is cut into rectangular sheets (32x14cm)<br>
which are placed one on top of another until a stack with a<br>
free height of about 5 cm. is reached. The nonwoven fabric<br>
stack is then wrapped with one layer of 0.01 mm thick<br>
polyurethane elastomeric film such as TUFTANE film<br>
(manufactured by Lord Corp., UK) which is sealed on the<br>
back with double-face clear tape.<br>
The Repeat Insult orifice plate consists of a 7.6 cm X<br>
25.4 cm plate of 1.3 cm thick polycarbonate with a circular<br>
orifice in its center. The diameter of the circular orifice<br>
is 2.0 cm. The orifice plate is centered on the sample to<br>
be tested. A graduated 10 cc syringe containing 2 ml of<br>
test fluid is held over the orifice plate such that the<br>
exit of the syringe is approximately 1 inch above the<br>
orifice. The syringe is held horizontally, parallel to the<br>
surface of the test plate, the fluid is then expelled from<br>
the syringe at a rate that allows the fluid to flow in a<br>
stream vertical to the test plate into the orifice and a<br>
stop watch is started when the test fluid first touches the<br>
sample to be tested. The stop watch is stopped when the<br>
surface of the sample first becomes visible within the<br>
orifice. The elapsed time on the stop watch is the first<br>
fluid penetration time. After an interval of 5 minutes<br>
elapsed time, a second 2 ml of test fluid is expelled from<br>
the syringe into the circular orifice of the Repeat Insult<br>
Orifice Plate and timed as previously described to obtain a<br>
second fluid penetration time. This sequence is repeated<br>
until a total of six fluid insults, each separated by 5<br>
minutes, have been timed. The Percent Increase in Fluid<br>
Penetration Time after Six Insults is calculated as: 100<br>
times the difference between the first and sixth insult<br>
times divided by the first insult time. The Average Percent<br>
Increase in Fluid Penetration Time is calculated from the<br>
results of testing five samples.<br>
