				<td>TRICYCLIC COMPOUNDS PROTEIN KINASE INHIBITORS FOR ENHANCING THE EFFICACY OF ANTI-NEOPLASTIC AGENTS AND RADIATION THERAPY<br>
Field of The Invention<br>
This invention relates to novel tricyclic compounds of formula I that inhibit protein kinases, preferably CHK-1. The invention further relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds, and to methods for the treatment of a condition which can be treated by the inhibition of protein kinases, preferably CHK-1, in a mammal by administering effective amounts of such compounds in conjunction with an anti-neoplastic agent, a radiation therapy, or as a single agent.<br>
Background of The Invention<br>
A eukaryotic cell cycle has a carefully regulated progression of phases: initial gap (Gi), DMA synthesis (S), secondary gap (G2), and mitosis (M). Gi, S and G2 are known as interphase. In GI, the cell, whose biosynthetic pathways were slowed during mitosis, resumes a high rate of RNA and protein .biosynthesis. The S phase begins when DNA synthesis starts and ends when the DNA content of the nucleus has been replicated. The cell then enters G2 where again RNA and protein biosynthesis occur. Following G2, the cell enters M phase that begins with nuclear division and ends with the complete division of the cytoplasm into two daughter cells. This marks the beginning of interphase for the new cells. Non-dividing cells exist at Go, a time following mitosis and before DNA synthesis.<br>
Checkpoint enzymes, such as the serine/threonine protein kinase called checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK-1 or p56CHK-1), are responsible for maintaining the order and fidelity of events in the cell cycle. CHK-1 transduces signals from the DNA damage sensory complex to inhibit activation of Cdc2-cyclin B complex which promotes mitotic entry (Science, 277, 1501-1505 (1997); Science, 277, 1497-1501 ((1997)). In eukaryotes, Cdc2 is known as Cdk1 (cyclin-dependent kinase 1). CHK-1 regulates Cdc25, a dual specificity phosphatase that activates Cdc2. Thus, CHK-1 serves as the direct link between the G2 checkpoint and the negative regulation of Cdc2.<br>
Healthy cells have both the G1 and G2 checkpoints and their associated repair processes to ensure viability after treatment of DNA damage (chemotherapy and/or radiation). Cancer cells, however, rely exclusively on the G2 checkpoint and its associated repair processes in order to remain viable and to continue replication. Abrogation of the Q2 checkpoint would leave cancer cells with no means to delay progression into mitosis following DNA damage. Inactivation of CHK-1 has been shown to abrogate G2 arrest induced by DNA damage inflicted by either anticancer agents or endogenous DNA damage. In addition, inactivation of CHK-1 results in preferential killing of the resulting DNA damaged, checkpoint defective cells (Cell, 91, 865-867 (1997); Science, 277, 1450-1451 (1997); Nature, 363, 368-371 (1993); Molec. Biol. Cell, 5, 147-160 (1994)). Therefore there is a need for small molecule inhibitors of CHK-1 to preferentially<br>
abrogate the G2 checkpoint over G1 and to effectively remove the only checkpoint control found in many types of cancers. When administered during the course of a DNA damaging event, such as chemotherapy employing anti-neoplastic agents, radiation therapy, immunotherapies and antiangiogenic therapies, a CHK-1 inhibitor can sensitize cancer cells thereby triggering damage-mediated apoptosis. Therefore there is a need for a combination therapy involving CHK-1 inhibitor in the course of a DNA damaging event.<br>
Since protein kinases are ubiquitous and interrelated, selective modulation of a single kinase, such as CHK-1, or family of kinases may not result in an effective therapeutic treatment. There is therefore a need for small molecule inhibitors to influence one or more targeted protein kinases whose inhibition, taken as a whole, would produce the desired therapeutic treatment. Although kinase selectivity and its relation to generalized toxicity are important, therapeutic efficacy may rely on the inhibition of more than one protein kinase. Chemical core structures that can be suitably appended to interact selectively and potently with targeted protein kinases represent a valuable tool for drug discovery and scientific research. Therefore there is a need for such a core structure as an inhibitor of one or more protein kinases. Whether administered as a single agent or as co-therapy, the protein kinase inhibitors, such as CHK-1 inhibitors, of the present invention could prove beneficial in the treatment of a number of human diseases, such as cancer.<br>
Certain CHK-1 inhibitors have been proposed for cancer therapy (see Sanchez, Y. etal. (1997) Science 277: 1497-1501 and Flaggs, G. et. al. (1997) Current Biology 7:977-986; U.S. Patent Nos. 6,413,755, 6,383,744, and 6,211,164; and International Publication Nos. WO 01/16306, WO 01/21771, WO 00/16781, and WO 02/070494).<br>

The CHK-1 inhibitor of the present invention may be administered in combination with other anti-neoplasm therapies including anti-neoplastic agents and radiation therapy.<br>
The term "in combination with" means that the compound of Formula I may be administered shortly before, shortly after, concurrently, or any combination of before, after, or concurrently, with such other anti-neoplasm therapies. Thus, the compound and the anti-neoplastic agent may be administered simultaneously as either as a single composition or as two separate compositions or sequentially as two separate compositions. Likewise, the compound and radiation therapy may be administered simultaneously, separately or sequentially. The compound may be administered in combination with more than one anti-neoplasm therapy. In a preferred embodiment, the compound may be administered from 2 weeks to 1 day before any chemotherapy, or 2 weeks to 1 day before any radiation therapy. In another preferred embodiment, the CHK-1 inhibitor may be administered during anti-neoplastic chemotherapies and radiation therapies. If administered following such chemotherapy or radiation therapy, the CHK-1 inhibitor may be given within 1 to 14 days following the primary treatments. The CHK-1 inhibitor may also be administered chronically or semi-chronically, over a period of from about 2 weeks to about 5 years. One skilled in the art will recognize that the amount of CHK-1 inhibitor to be administered in accordance with the present invention in combination with other antineoplastic agents or therapies is that amount sufficient to enhance the anti-neoplasm effects of anti-neoplastic agents or radiation therapies or that amount sufficient to induce apoptosis or cell death along with the anti-neoplastic or radiation therapy and/or to maintain an antiangiogenic effect. Such amount may vary, among other factors, depending upon the size and the type of neoplasia, the concentration of the compound in the therapeutic formulation, the specific anti-neoplasm agents used, the timing of the administration of the CHK-1 inhibitors relative to the other therapies, and the age, size and condition of the patient.<br>
The term "protein kinases", as used herein, refers to enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of hydroxy groups on tyrosine, serine and threonine residues of proteins. The consequences of this seemingly simple activity are staggering; cell growth, differentiation and proliferation, i.e., virtually all aspects of cell life in one way or another depend on the protein kinase activity. Furthermore, abnormal protein kinase activity has been related to a host of disorders, ranging from relatively non-life threatening diseases such as psoriasis to extremely virulent diseases such as glioblastoma (brain cancer). The protein kinases can be conveniently broken down into two major classes, the protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and the serine-threonine kinases (STKs). In addition, a third class of dual specificity kinases which can phosphorylate both tyrosine and serine-threonine residues is known. Examples of protein kinases and their isoforms<br>
contemplated within this invention include, but are not limited to, Checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK-1), Checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK-2), Cyclin dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), Serum and glucocorticoid regulated kinase (SGK), Adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Lymphoid T cell tyrosine kinase (LCK), Mitogen activated protein kinase-2 (MAPK-2), Mitogen-and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1), Protein Kinase B (PKB), Protein Kinase B alpha (PKBa), Rho kinase (ROCK-II), P70 S6 kinase (p70S6K), cAMP (adenosine 3',5' cyclic monophosphate)-dependent protein kinase (PKA), Mitogen activated protein kinase-1 (MAPK-1), Protein kinase C-related kinase 2 (PRK2), 3'-Phosphoinositide dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), Fyn kinase (FYN), Protein kinase C (PKC), Protein Kinase C Beta 2 (PKCpll), Protein Kinase C Gamma (PKCy), Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), Phosphorylase kinase (PHK), Wee1 kinase (Wee1), and Protein Kinase B (PKB).<br>
Checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK-2) acts as a cell cycle checkpoint controller in response to DNA damage. CHK-2 is a downstream effector of ATM which phosphorylates p53 protein and affects cell cycle progreesion from G1 to the S phase. CHK-2 activation also affects S phase progression. In addition along with CHK-1, CHK-2 influences G2/M transition and plays a role in apoptosis if the damage cannot be repaired. CHK-2 could play a role in sensitizing cancer cells to DMA-damaging therapies. CHK-2 may also play a role as a tumor suppressor. Bartek, J. et al. (2001) Nature Reviews, Molecular Cell biology 2:877-886.<br>
Cyclin dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) is also known as Cdc2 in yeast cells. The cell cycle directs specific events that control growth and proliferation of cells. The cyclin B/Cdk1 complex promotes entry into mitosis. Cyclin B1 overexpression has been found in 90% of colorectal carcinomas Since the cell cycle is dysregulated in human cancers, modulation of CDK activity is a possible therapy. Olomoucine, a CDK inhibitor, has been shown to inhibit cellular proliferation in human cancer cells. In lymphoma cells, olomoucine arrests the cell cycle in both the G1 and G2 phases by inhibiting cyclin E/CDK2 and cyclin B/CDK1. Buolamwini, J.K.

Serum and glucocorticoid regulated kinase (SGK) is rapidly and highly regulated by corticosteroids in A6 cells at the mRNA and protein levels. SGK is also induced by aldosterone in the kidney of adrenalectomized rats. SGK is activated by 3'-phosphoinositide dependent kinase 1 (PDK1). SGK might play a critical role in aldosterone target cells and may be physiologically important in the early response to aldosterone. Aldosterone receptor antagonists have recently shown great promise in clinical trials for patients with heart failure. The ability to mediate the physiological responses to aldosterone may like-wise prove beneficial. See Leslie, N. R. et. al. (2001) Chemical Reviews 101(8):2365-2380; Funder, J. W.

Lymphoid T cell tyrosine kinase (LCK) is a cytosolic non-receptor tyrosine kinase and a T-lymphocyte member of the Src family. LCK has been implicated in early phase T-cell receptor activation by antigens and plays a critical role in T-cell mediated immune responses. Upon activation by autophosphorylation, LCK phosphorylates T-cell receptor ^-chains which can then recruit a second cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 to promote T-cell activation. Inhibitors could be used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, diseases related to immune response and T-cell based leukemias and lymphomas. See Garcia-Echeverria, C. (2001) Current Medicinal Chemistry 8(13): 1589-1604; Majolini, M. B. et. al. (1999) Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma 35(3/4):245-254.<br>
Mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1) is activated on stimulation of the Ras-mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and also by the p38 stress kinase pathway. Both pathways are implicated in tumorigenesis. Stimulation of the Ras-MAPK signal transduction pathway by growth factors or phorbol esters results in phosphorylation of histone H3. MSK1 has been shown to mediate epidermal growth factor (EGF) or TPA (12-O-<br>
tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, a phorbol ester) induced phosphorylation of H3. There is<br>
« evidence that persistent activation of Ras-MAPK pathway and MSK1  resulting in elevated<br>
phosphorylated H3 levels may contribute to aberrant gene expression observed in oncogene-transformed cells. Inhibition of MSK1 suppressed the induction of c-fos (proto-oncogene) and uPA genes in parental and oncogene-transformed cells. Both c-fos and uPA are involved in tumor invasion and metastasis. See Strelkov, I. et. al. (2002) Cancer Research 62(1):75-78; Zhong, S. et. al. (2001) Journal of Biological Chemistry 276(35):33213-33219; Nomura, M. et. al.

Rho kinase (ROCK-II) is also known as ROKcc. By inhibiting ROCK-II, one could potentially influence Rho GTPases which act as molecular controls that regulate many essential cellular processes, including actin dynamics, cell-cycle progression, and cell adhesion. The in vitro and in vivo biological effects of Y-27632, a specific inhibitor of ROCK, have been described in the literature and include lowering blood pressure in hypertensive rats, inhibition of Rho-induced formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions, and inhibition of tumor growth. See Narumiya, S. et. al(2000) Methods in Enzymology 325 (Regulators and Effectors of Small GTPases, Part D): 273-284 (and associated references listed therein); Bishop, et al. (2000) Biochem. J. 348: 241-255.<br>
P70 S6 kinase (p70S8K) is found as two isoforms-one cytoplasmic and the other in the nucleus. They are similar except for N-terminus, and both are called p70S6K or S6K1. A second functional homologue S6K2 was also identified. P70S6K is a downstream target of the lipid kinase phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (PI(3)K). pyo86" is implicated in cell cycle control and neuronal cell differentiation. P70S6K may also function in regulating cell motility which could influence tumor metastases, the immune response, and tissue repair. Along with PKB/Akt, p70S6K is a crucial effector in oncogenic protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) signaling. P70S6Kmay be a more potent kinase for BAD than PKB/Akt (see above) in response to insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1) stimulation. P70S6K may therefore play an important antiapoptotic role.

cAMP (adenosine 3',5' cyclic monophosphate)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is involved in a wide range of physiological responses following interaction with cAMP. cAMP is a second messenger that regulates many different cellular activities such as gene transcription, cell growth and differentiation, ion channel conductivity, and release of neurotransmitters. The cAMP/PKA interaction acts as a major regulatory mechanism in mammals, and PKA has been shown phosphorylate a myriad of physiological substrates. PKA has two major isoforms- PKAI and PKAI I. PKAI inhibitors have shown enhancing effects when used in combination certain cytotoxic cancer therapies. Antisense oligonucleotides targeting the PKAI subunit Riot have shown enhanced anti-tumor effects when combined with Taxol. Glucagon activates PKA and PKA may influence insulin response along with calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C. PKA is involved in regulating cardiac L-type calcium channels, and modulation of the implicated regulatory pathways may prove useful in the treatment of heart disease. In addition, dysfunctional T-cells isolated from HIV patients have been restored by the addition of PKAI antagonists. See Skalhegg, B.S. et. al.

Mitogen activated protein kinase (MARK) is also known as ERK. In tumorigenesis, ras oncogenes transmit extracellular growth signals. The MARK pathway is an important signaling route between membrane-bound ras and the nucleus. A phosphorylation cascade involving three key kinases is involved. They are Raf, MEK (MAP kinase kinase) and MAPK/ERK. Raf isoforms phosphorylate and activate isoforms MEK1 and MEK2. MEK1 and 2 are dual specificity kinases that in turn phosphorylate and activate the.MAPK isoforms MAPK1/ERK1 and MAPK2/ERK2. In fibroblasts, MAPK1/ERK1 and MAPK2/ERK2 are both strongly activated by growth factors and by tumor-promoting phorbol esters. MAPK1/ERK1 and MAPK2/ERK2 are also involved with glucose regulation, neurotransmitter regulation, and secetagogue regulation (in endocrine tissues). The MAPK pathway has also been linked to the induction of cyclin D1 mRNA and thus linked to G1 phase of cell cycle. See Webb, C.P. et. al. (2000) Cancer Research 60(2), 342-349; Roovers, K. et. al.

cSrc (also known as p60 c-src) is cytosolic, non-receptor tyrosine kinase. c-Src is involved in the transduction of mitogenic signals from a number of polypeptide growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). c-Src is over expressed in mammary cancers, pancreatic cancers, neuroblastomas, and others. Mutant c-Src has been identified in human colon cancer. c-Src phosphorylates a number of proteins that are involved in regulating cross-talk between the extracellular matrix and the cytoplasmic actin cytoskeleton. Modulation cSrc activity could have implications in diseases relating to cell proliferation, differentiation and death. See Bjorge, J.D. et. al. (2000) Oncogene 19(49):5620-5635; Halpem, M.

(2001) Chemical Reviews 101:2425-2440; Protein kinase C-related kinase 2 (PRK2) is regulated by the G-protein Rho. PRK2 is found in regions of large actin turnover. Endogenous PRK2 kinase activity increases with keratinocyte differentiation and is associated with keratinocyte cell-cell adhesion and Fyn kinase activation. See Gross, C.r et. al. (2001) FEBS Letters 496(2,3): 101-104; Calautti, E. et. al. (2002) Journal of Cell Biology 156(1 ):137-148.<br>
3'-Phosphoinositide dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) phosphorylates and activates members of the AGO (cAMP-dependent, cGMP-dependent, and protein kinase C) kinase family that are activated downstream of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). PI3K becomes active through insulin stimulation. PDK1 activates a number of protein kinases and therefore can be connected to the regulation of a number of insulin specific events. PDK1 phosphorylation and activation of PKC£ is necessary for insulin-dependent GLUT4 translocation. Insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation is physiologically related to the actin-based cytoskeleton. Disturbances in actin filaments have been linked to loss of insulin effect on glucose transport and decreased translocation of GLUT4. See Wick, K. L. et. al.

Fyn kinase (FYN) is a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases. Fyn has been implicated in positive control of keratinocyte cell-cell adhesion. Adhesion plays a crucial function in establishment and maintenance of organized tissues. Fyn knockout and transgenic mice established that Fyn participates in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. Overexpression of the fyn(T) transgene produces T cells with enhanced responsiveness to TCR signaling. Conversely, expression of an inactive kinase form is inhibitory. Fyn may be an appropriate target for treatment of autoimmune diseases. Fyn -/- mice are hypersensitive to alcohol which suggests that Fyn might be a target for the treatment of alcoholism. Alteration of Fyn levels may also aid in the treatment of skin disorders. Fyn has been implicated in the regulation of programmed cell death, and FyrW-mice exhibit reduced apoptosis. See also PRK2. See Calautti, E. et. al. (2002) Journal of Cell Biology 156(1): 137-148; Resh, M. D. (1998J Journal of Biochemistry &amp; Cell Biology 30(11):1159-1162.<br>
Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) is also known as FLK-1 and as KDR (kinase insert domain receptor). Other VEGF receptor tyrosine kinases include VEGFR-1(Flt-1) and VEGFR-3 (Flt-4). Angiogenesis or the development of new vasculature is central to the process by which solid tumors grow. The degree of vasculaturization has been linked with increased potential for metastasis. VEGFR-2, expressed only on endothelial cells, binds the potent angiogenic growth factor VEGF and mediates the subsequent signal transduction. Inhibition of VEGF-R2 activity has resulted in decreased angiogenesis and tumor growth in in vivo models, and inhibitors of VEGFR-1 are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer.

Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) binds the angiogenic growth factors aFGF and bFGF and mediates subsequent intracellular signal transduction. Growth factors such as bFGF may play a critical role in inducing angiogenesis in solid tumors that have reached a certain size. FGFR is expressed in a number of different cell types throughout the body and may or may not play important roles in normal physiological processes in adult humans. Systemic administration of a small-molecule inhibitor of FGFR has been reported to block bFGF-induced angiogenesis in mice.

Phosphorylase kinase (PHK) activates glycogen phosphorylase. The primary consequence of this activation is to release glucose 1-phosphate from glycogen. Conversion to glycogen is the major means by which glucose is stored in mammals. Intracellular glycogen stores are used to maintain blood-glucose homeostasis during fasting and are a source of energy for muscle contraction. In Vivo, PHK is phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) which increases the specific activity of PHK. Both Type 1 and 2 diabetics show reduced glycogen levels in liver and muscle cells. Glycogen levels are tightly regulated by hormones and metabolic signaling. Kinase inhibitors that could augment intracellular glycogen levels may prove beneficial in the treatment of diabetes.

Wee1 kinase (Wee1) along with Mik1 kinase has been shown to phosphorylate Cdc2. Phosphorylation of Cdc2 has been shown to prevent mitotic entry. Wee1 may play an important role the normal growth cycle of cells and may be implicated in cell-cycle checkpoint control. Rhind, N. et al. (2001) Molecular and Cellular Biology 21(5):1499-1508.<br>
Protein Kinase B (PKB) is also known as Akt. There are three very similar isoforms known as PKB a, p. and y (or Akt 1, 2, and 3). Ultraviolet irradiation in the 290-320nM range has been associated with the harmful effects of sunlight. This irradiation causes activation of PKB/Akt and may be implicated in tumorigenesis. Over expressed PKB/Akt has been shown in ovarian, prostate, breast &amp; pancreatic cancers. PKB/Akt is also involved in cell cycle progression. PKB/Akt promotes cell survival in a number of ways. It phosphorylates the proapoptotic protein, BAD, so that it is unable to bind and inactivate the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xl. PKB/Akt also serves to inhibit apoptosis by inhibiting caspase 9 and forkhead transcription factor and by activating IkB kinase. See Barber, A.J.

Protein kinase C (PKC) classical isoforms are designated a,p1, p2 and y. and all are Ca2+ dependent. PKC isoforms are involved in signal transduction pathways linked to a number of physiological responses including membrane transport, cellular differentiation and proliferation, organization of cytoskeletal proteins and gene expression. Tumor promoting phorbol esters activate classical PKC isoforms and antisense oligonucleotides can block this activation. PKC isoforms are often over expressed in various cancers. PKC inhibitors have been shown to reverse p-glycoprotein-mediated multi-drug resistance and can increase intracellular concentrations of other anti-cancer agents. In myocytes, PKC isoforms have been implicated in certain cardiac pathologies. PKC~y is highly expressed in brain and spinal cord and is primarily localized in dendrites and neuron cell bodies. PKC-(32 is involved in cell proliferation and overexpression increases sensitivity to cancer. PKCp inhibitors are a potential new therapy for diabetic retinopathy with clinical trials ongoing.

It is to be understood that the invention encompasses any tautomeric form which modulates and/or inhibits kinase activity and is not to be limited merely to any one tautomeric form utilized within the formula drawings.<br>
Some of the inventive compounds may exist as single stereoisomers (i.e., essentially free of other stereoisomers), racemates, and/or mixtures of enantiomers and/or diastereomers. All such single stereoisomers, racemates and mixtures thereof are intended to be within the scope of the present invention. Preferably, the inventive compounds that are optically active are used in optically pure form.<br>
As generally understood by those skilled in the art, an optically pure compound having one chiral center (i.e., one asymmetric carbon atom) is one that consists essentially of one of the two possible enantiomers (i.e., is enantiomerically pure), and an optically pure compound having more than one chiral center is one that is both diastereomerically pure and enantiomerically pure. Preferably, the compounds of the present invention are used in a form that is at least 90% optically pure, that is, a form that contains at least 90% of a single isomer (80% enantiomeric excess ("e.e.") or diastereomeric excess ("d.e.")), more preferably at least 95% (90% e.e. or d.e.), even more preferably at least 97.5% (95% e.e. or d.e.), and most preferably at least 99% (98% e.e. or d.e.).<br>

The pharmaceuticaliy acceptable salts of the compound of Formula I can also exist as various solvates, such as with water, methanol, ethanol, dimethylformamide, ethyl acetate and the like. Mixtures of such solvates can also be prepared. The source of such solvate can be from the solvent of crystallization, inherent in the solvent of preparation or crystallization, or adventitious to such solvent.<br>

High LET radiation is also applied from radioactive sources implanted interstitially.<br>
The specific dosage amount of a compound of the Formula I, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or prodrug thereof being administered to obtain therapeutic or inhibitory effects may be determined in a manner known in the art according to the particular circumstances surrounding the case, including, e.g., the specific agent being administered, the route of administration, the condition being treated, and the subject or host being treated. An exemplary total daily dose of a compound of the Formula I, which may be administered in single or multiple doses, contains a dosage level of from about 0.01mg/kg body weight to about 50 mg/kg body<br>
weight.<br>
The compounds of the Formula I of the invention may be administered by any of a variety of suitable routes, such as orally, rectally, transdermally, subcutaneously, intravenously, intramuscularly, or intranasally. The compounds of the Formula I are preferably formulated into compositions suitable for the desired routes before being administered.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition or preparation according to the invention comprises an effective amount of a compound of the Formula I, optionally one or more other active agents, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as a diluent or excipient for the agent; when the<br>
carrier serves as a diluent, it may be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material acting as a vehicle, excipient, or medium for the active ingredient(s). Compositions according to the invention may be made by admixing the active ingredients) with a carrier, or diluting it with a carrier, or enclosing or encapsulating it within a carrier, which may be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper container, or the like. Exemplary ingredients, in addition to one or more compounds of the Formula I and any other active ingredients, include Avicel (microcrystalline cellulose), starch, lactose, calcium sulfate dihydrate, terra alba, sucrose, talc, gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, peanut oil, olive oil, glyceryl monostearate, Tween 80 (polysorbate 80), 1,3-butanediol, cocoa butter, beeswax, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol, glycine, sorbic acid, potassium sorbate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, and water.<br>
The compositions may be prepared in any of a variety of forms suitable for the desired mode of administration. For example, pharmaceutical compositions may be prepared in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as solids or in liquid media), ointments (e.g., containing up to 10% by weight of a compound of the Formula I), soft-gel and hard-gel capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions, sterile packaged powders, and the like.<br>
Similarly, the carrier or diluent may include time-delay or time-release material known in the art, such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax, ethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, methylmethacrylate and the like.<br>
A variety of pharmaceutical forms can be employed. Thus, if a solid carrier is used, the preparation can be tableted, placed in a hard gelatin capsule in powder or pellet form or in the form of a troche or lozenge. The amount of solid carrier may vary, but generally will be from about 25 mg to about 1 g. If a liquid carrier is used, the preparation can be in the form of syrup, emulsion, soft gelatin capsule, sterile injectable solution or suspension in an ampoule or vial or non-aqueous liquid suspension.<br>
To obtain a stable water-soluble dose form, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of an inventive agent is dissolved in an aqueous solution of an organic or inorganic acid, such as 0.3M solution of succinic acid or citric acid. If a soluble salt form is not available, the agent may be dissolved in a suitable cosolvent or combinations of cosolvents. Examples of suitable cosolvents include, but are not limited to, alcohol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol 300, polysorbate 80, gylcerin and the like in concentrations ranging from 0-60% of the total volume. A compound of Formula I may be dissolved in DMSO and diluted with water. The composition may also be in the form of a solution of a salt form of the active ingredient in an appropriate aqueous vehicle such as water or isotonic saline or dextrose solution.<br>
The compositions of the invention may be manufactured in manners generally known for preparing pharmaceutical compositions, e.g., using conventional techniques such as mixing,<br>
dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or lyophilizing. Pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in a conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers, which may be selected from excipients and auxiliaries that facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically.<br>
Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen. For injection, the agents of the invention may be formulated into aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hanks's solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological saline buffer. For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art.<br>
For oral administration, the compounds can be formulated readily by combining the active compounds with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers known in the art. Such carriers enable the compounds of the invention to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a patient to be treated. Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained using a solid excipient in admixture with the active ingredient (agent), optionally grinding the resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients include: fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; and cellulose preparations, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, gum, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methyl cellulose, or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). If desired, disintegrating agents may be added, such as crosslinked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof such as sodium alginate.<br>
Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated sugar solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arable, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, Carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active agents.<br>
Pharmaceutical preparations which can be used orally include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with fillers such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate, and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active agents may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In addition, stabilizers may be added. All formulations for oral administration should be in dosages suitable for such administration. For buccal administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner.<br>
For administration intranasally or by inhalation, the compounds for use according to the present invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator and the like may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.<br>
The compounds may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit-dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble form. Additionally, suspensions of the active agents may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions.<br>
For administration to the eye, the active agent is delivered in a pharmaceutically acceptable ophthalmic vehicle such that the compound is maintained in contact with the ocular surface for a sufficient time period to allow the compound to penetrate the comeal and internal regions of the eye, including, for example, the anterior chamber, posterior chamber, vitreous body, aqueous humor, vitreous humor, cornea, iris/ciliary, lens, choroid/retina and sclera. The pharmaceutically acceptable ophthalmic vehicle may be an ointment, vegetable oil, or an encapsulating material. A compound of the invention may also be injected directly into the vitreous and aqueous humor.<br>
Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use. The compounds may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
The compounds may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long-acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example, as an emulsion in an<br>
acceptable oil) or ion-exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt.<br>
A pharmaceutical carrier for hydrophobic compounds is a cosolvent system comprising benzyl alcohol, a nonpolar surfactant, a water-miscible organic polymer, and an aqueous phase. The cosolvent system may be a VPD co-solvent system. VPD is a solution of 3% w/v benzyl alcohol, 8% w/v of the nonpolar surfactant polysorbate 80, and 65% w/v polyethylene glycol 300, made up to volume in absolute ethanol. The VPD co-solvent system (VPD:5W) contains VPD diluted 1:1 with a 5% dextrose in water solution. This co-solvent system dissolves hydrophobic compounds well, and itself produces low toxicity upon systemic administration. Naturally, the proportions of a co-solvent system may be varied considerably without destroying its solubility and toxicity characteristics. Furthermore, the identity of the co-solvent components may be varied: for example, other low-toxicity nonpolar surfactants may be used instead of polysorbate 80; the fraction size of polyethylene glycol may be varied; other biocompatible polymers may replace polyethylene glycol, e.g. polyvinyl pyrrolidone; and other sugars or polysaccharides may be substituted for dextrose.<br>
Alternatively, other delivery systems for hydrophobic pharmaceutical compounds may be employed. Liposomes and emulsions are known examples of delivery vehicles or carriers for hydrophobic drugs. Certain organic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide also may be employed, although usually at the cost of greater toxicity. Additionally, the compounds may be delivered using a sustained-release system, such as semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the therapeutic agent. Various sustained-release materials have been established and are known by those skilled in the art. Sustained-release capsules may, depending on their chemical nature, release the compounds for a few weeks up to over 100 days. Depending on the chemical nature and the biological stability of the therapeutic reagent, additional strategies for protein stabilization may be employed.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions also may comprise suitable solid- or gel-phase carriers or excipients. Examples of such carriers or excipients include calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, and polymers such as polyethylene glycols.<br>
Some of the compounds of the invention may be provided as salts with pharmaceutically compatible counter ions. Pharmaceutically compatible salts may be formed with many acids, including hydrochloric, sulfuric, acetic, lactic, tartaric, malic, succinic, etc. Salts tend to be more soluble in aqueous or other protonic solvents than are the corresponding free-base forms.<br>
The compounds of the Formula I, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or prodrug thereof are useful as anti-angiogenesis agents and as agents for modulating and/or inhibiting the activity of protein kinases, thus providing treatments for cancer or other diseases associated with cellular proliferation mediated by protein kinases.<br>
Therapeutically effective amounts of the agents of the invention may be used to treat diseases mediated by modulation or regulation of protein kinases. An "effective amount" is intended to mean that amount of an agent that, when administered to a mammal in need of such treatment, is sufficient to effect treatment for a disease mediated by the activity of one or more kinases. Thus, e.g., a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the Formula I, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or prodrug thereof is a quantity sufficient to modulate, regulate, or inhibit the activity of one or more kinases such that a disease condition which is mediated by that activity is reduced or alleviated.<br>
BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION<br>
Enzyme Assays CHK-1 Construct for Assay<br>
As previously detailed in European Patent Application No. 1 096 014 A2 (filed October 31, 2000), the C-terminally His-tagged kinase domain of human CHK-1 (KH289), amino acid residues 1-289, can be expressed using the baculovirus/insect cell system. This construct has been shown to possess catalytic activity approximately 10-fold greater than full length CHK-1. The Bac-to-Bac system (Life Technologies) can be used to generate recombinant baculovirus for the expression of KH289 as per instructions. Recombinant viruses can be confirmed by PCR for the presence of CHK-1 cDNA insertion. Protein expression can be confirmed by SDS-PAGE or Western blot with CHK-1 polyclonal antibodies. Sf9 insect cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) can be used for initial amplification of recombinant virus stock. High titer stocks of recombinant viruses can be generated by 2 to 3 rounds of amplification using Sf21 insect cells. Hi-S insect cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) can be used for protein production. Both Sf9 and Hi-S cell lines can be adapted to grow in insect medium containing 1% Fetal Bovine Serum (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). The viral stock was stored at 10°C and used for large-scale protein production within 2 months to avoid viral instability. For protein production, infected Hi-S cells can be harvested by centrifugation and stored at -80°C. From these cells, 6X-His tagged KH289 (identified by SDS-PAGE) can be obtained after purification and can be flash-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80°C. Maintaining salt concentration around 500 mM NaCI including 5% glycerol was found to be crucial for preventing aggregation of CHK-1 proteins during purification and<br>
storage.<br>
CHK-1 Assay<br>
As previously detailed in European Patent Application No. 1 096 014 A2 (filed October 31, 2000), the enzymatic activity of a kinase can be measured by its ability to catalyze the transfer of a phosphate residue from a nucleoside triphosphate to an amino acid side chain in a selected protein target. The conversion of ATP to ADP generally accompanies the catalytic reaction. Herein, a synthetic substrate peptide, Syntide-2, having amino acid sequence PLARTLSVAGLPGKK can be utilized. The production of ADP from ATP that accompanies<br>
phosphoryl transfer to the substrate can be coupled to oxidation of NADH using phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) through the actions of pyruvate kinase (PK) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). The oxidation of NADH can be monitored by following the decrease of absorbance at 340 nm (e340=6.22 cm-1 mM-1) using a HP8452 spectre-photometer. Typical reaction solutions contained: 4 mM PEP, 0.15 mM NADH, 28 units of LDH/mL, 16 units of PK/mL, 3 mM DTT, 0. 125 mM Syntide-2, 0.15 mM ATP and 25 mM MgC!2 in 50 mM TRIS pH 7.5; 400 mM NaCI.

The data can be analyzed using Enzyme Kinetic and Kaleidagraph software.<br>

A construct (VEGF-R2A50) of the cytosolic domain of (human) vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGF-R2) lacking the 50 central residues of the 68 residues of the kinase insert domain can be expressed in a baculovirus/insect cell system. Of the 1356 residues of full-length VEGF-R2, VEGF-R2A50 contains residues 806-939 and 990-1171, and also one point mutation (E990V) within the kinase insert domain relative to wild-type VEGF-R2. Autophosphorylation of the purified construct can be performed by incubation of the enzyme at a concentration of 4 nM in the presence of 3 mM ATP and 40 mM MgCI2 in 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 5% glycerol and 5 mM DTT, at 4 °C for 2 hours. After autophosphorylation, this construct has been shown to possess catalytic activity essentially equivalent to the wild-type autophosphorylated kinase domain construct. See Parast et al. (1998) Biochemistry 37:16788-16801.<br>

The production of ADP from ATP that accompanies phosphoryl transfer can be coupled to oxidation of NADH using phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and a system having pyruvate kinase (PK) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). The oxidation of NADH can be monitored by following the decrease of absorbance at 340 nm (6340 = 6.22 cm"1 mM*1) using a Beckman DU 650 spectrophotometer. Assay conditions for phosphorylated VEGF-R2A50 can be the following: 1 mM PEP; 250 nM NADH; 50 units of LDH/mL; 20 units of PK/mL; 5 mM DTT; 5.1 mM poly^Yi); 1 mM ATP; and 25 mM MgCI2 in 200 mM HEPES, pH 7.5.

Phosphorvlase Kinase Assay.<br>
In the assay, the purified catalytic subunit can be used to phosphorylate phosphorylase b using radiolabled ATP. Briefly, 1.5 mg/ml of phosphorylase b can be incubated with 10 nM phosphorylase kinase in 10 mM MgCI2, 50 mM Hepes pH 7.4, at 37 °C. The reaction can be started with the addition of ATP to 100 uM and incubated for 15 min at 25 °C or 37 °C. The reaction can be terminated and proteins can be precipitated by the addition of TCA to 10% final concentration. The precipitated proteins can be isolated on a 96 well Millipore MADP NOB filter plate. The filter plate can be extensively washed with 20% TCA, and dried. Scintilation fluid can be then added to the plate and incorporated radiolabel can be counted on a Wallac microbeta counter. The % inhibition of phosphoryl transfer from ATP to phosphorylase b in the presence of 10 ^M of compound can then be measured.<br>

Whole Cell Checkpoint Abrogation Assay<br>
Chk1 Mitotic Index ELISA Assay<br>
To examine the in vitro effects of Chk1 inhibitory compounds, an ELISA assay can be designed to monitor the abrogation of DNA damage-induced checkpoint control. The assay can be based on the trapping and detection of mitotic cells following DNA damage-induced arrest. Phosphorylation of Histone H3 on serine 10 has been shown to correlate with mitosis and therefore can be required for chromosome condensation; consequently a mitosis specific phospho-epitope on Histone H3 can be used as a signal for checkpoint abrogation.<br>
CA-46 (lymphoma) cells can be treated with a DNA damaging agent, such as camptothecin (Sigma), at 50nM for 8 hours to induce DNA damage. The control compound or Chk1 inhibitor can be then added at increasing concentrations with Nocodazole (Sigma) at<br>
0.1jig/ml and plates can be incubated for 16 hours. Control cells, where only Chk1 inhibitors can be added, can be prepared as well to assure that the inhibitors alone have no effect on the cell cycle. The cells can be then harvested, washed with PBS, and crude acid extraction can be performed. Pellets can be resuspended in 80&gt;l of Acid Extraction Buffer (10mM Hepes pH 7.9, 1.5mM MgCI2, 10mM KCI, O.SmM DTT, 1.5mM PMSF, 0.4N sulfuric acid), vortexed briefly, and incubated for 30 minutes on ice. Samples can be then centrifuged and 75ul of the supernatant can be transferred to a 96 well flat-bottom plate (VWR 3596). Next 15u.l Neutralizing Cocktail (# of samples x (10^110N NaOH + 5jil1M Tris Base) can be added to each well, and after mixing, 5ul of this can be transferred to another 96 well plate with 100^1 50mM Tris base (pH 9.6) in each well. Samples can be dried overnight. The wells can be then washed with 200^1 ELISA wash buffer (PBS with 20mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween 20) 5 times and blocked with 200uJ blocking buffer (PBS with 20mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween 20, 3.5% Dry milk, 1.5% BSA. pH to 7.5 after preparation) for 1 hour at room temperature. Following wash and block, anti-phospho Histone H3 antibodies (Upstate USA, Inc., rabbit polyclonal) can be added at 0.5ug/ml in block (100uJ per well) and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Wells can be washed again to remove unbound primary antibody and 100ul alkaline phosphatase conjugated secondary antibodies at 0.3mg/ml (Pierce, goat anti-rabbit IgG (HOURS+L)) in block can be added for 1 hour at room temp. Wells can be washed 5 times to remove unbound secondary antibody, and washed again 3 times with PBS alone to remove detergents. Then 100^1 alkaline phosphatase substrate (Pierce 1-Step pNPP) can be added to wells. Plates can be protected from light and incubated at room temp for 1 hour. The OD can be read on Molecular Devices Vmax Kinetic Microplate Reader at 405nm. The ratio of the OD (optical density) of a compound treated sample to the Nocodazole only treated sample (about 100% mitotic or abrogation) can be expressed in a percentage, and quantifies the percent abrogation of the checkpoint. The concentration at which a compound causes 50% abrogation of the checkpoint can be called the ECso. The raw OD values can be graphed in Excel, and an EC50 value can be generated using Kaleidograph software. Strong signal results from Nocodazole only treated cells, and equals 100% mitosis in this assay. Camptothecin + Nocodazole treated control samples have low signal, signifying no mitosis and therefore, no checkpoint abrogation. When potent Chk1 inhibitors are added to Camptothecin treated cells with Nocodazole, a high signal can be generated (generally in a dose dependent manner), due to the checkpoint abrogation activity caused by the combination treatment.<br>

Concentrated sulfuric acid (0.5 ml) was added slowly at ambient temperature with stirring to 2-methyl-3,5-dinitro-benzoic acid (5.22 g, 23.06 mmol) in anhydrous methanol (200 ml). After refluxing overnight under an argon atmosphere, the reaction was determined to be about 50% complete. Toluene (100 ml) was used to azeotrope the H2O generated from the reaction, and fresh anhydrous methanol (300 mL) and H2SO4 (0.5 mL) were added and the mixture was again refluxed overnight under an argon atmosphere at which point the volatile components were reduced in vacua. Ethyl acetate and 5% aqueous NaOH were added with stirring, and the product was extracted into the ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate was then washed twice each with 5% aqueous NaOH and saturated aqueous NaHCO3, once with brine and dried with Na2SO4 to give Intermediate 2(a) (4.65 g, 19.37 mmol) as a white solid in 84% yield. Step 2. Preparation of 6-Amino-1H-indole-4-carboxylic acid methyl ester 2(b) Using a modification of the procedure described by Coe, J.W., et. al. (1996) Tetrahedron Letters 37(34):6045-6048, Intermediate 2(a) (268 mg, 1.12 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (0.56 ml) and A/,/V-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal (0.445 mL, 3.35 mmol) was added under an Ar atmosphere with stirring. The mixture was heated at 120 °C overnight at which point the unreacted A/,A/-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal was removed under vacuum (35-40 °C, c.a. 5 mm Hg). To the resulting red enamine was added anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (c.a. 10 mL) and 10% palladium on carbon (230 mg) and the mixture was hydrogenated at 55 p.s.i. for 5 hours. The Pd catalyst was filtered through diatomaceous earth<br>
and H2O was added to the filtrate. The aqueous component was then extracted multiple times with ethyl acetate and the combined extracts were dried with Na2SO4, filtered, and the volatile components were removed in vacua to give the crude Intermediate 2(90 mg) as a brown glass. Purification was carried out by eluting through a silica plug with 20% ethyl acetate and 20% ethanol in hexane giving Intermediate 2(b) (45 mg, 0.24 mmol) as a brown solid in 21% yield. Step 3.

After removing the ice bath, the mixture was stirred for 0.5 hours at which point the reaction was again cooled in an ice bath and an additional Vilsmeier reagent (0.1 ml) was added. Following removal of the ice bath, the reaction was stirred 0.5 hours and then poured onto ice. Ethyl acetate was added followed by aqueous saturated NaHCO3. The product was then extracted into ethyl acetate, washed with brine, dried with Na2SO4, and filtered to give (by LCMS) di-A/-formylated 3-formyl-1H-indole-4-carboxylic acid methyl ester (37 mg, 0.13 mmol) as a brown glass which was then dissolved in anhydrous methanol (2.2 ml). Acetic acid (0.022, 0.384 mmol) and H2NNH2.H2O (0.038 mL, 0.78 mmol) were added, and the mixture was refluxed for 2 hours. After removing the volatile components in vacua, the crude product was dissolved in H2O and filtered, the water was lyophilized and the resulting yellow glass (36 mg) was chromatographed on silica gel eluting with 10% methanol in CH2CI2. Fractions judged pure were pooled, and the product in methanol was acidified with 1M HCI. The volatile components were removed in vacua using acetonitrile to azeotrope remaining water affording the title compound (4 mg, 0.016 mmol) as a brown solid in 7% yield.<br>

The crude 3,5-diamino-2-(2,2-dimethoxy-ethyl)-benzoic acid methyl ester was dissolved in anhydrous methanol (40 ml), and 4.0 M HCI in dioxane (160 ml) was added. The mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for one hour. The precipitated solid was collected by filtration and washed with CH2CI2 and diethyl ether and dried under vacuum to produce Intermediate 2(b) (hydrochloride) (11.85 g) as a gray solid.

Step 1. Preparation of 4-bromo-5-nitroisophthaIic acid 39(a)<br>
To a 3-L 4-neck round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, 250-mL addition funnel and charged with concentrated H2SO4 (577 mL), was added 4-bromoisophthalic acid (75.0 g, 306 mmol). The white suspension was cooled to ice-bath temperature and a nitrating reagent (pre-prepared by the careful addition of H2SO4 (169 mL) to HNO3 (107 mL)) was slowly added while maintaining an internal reaction temperature of less than 15 °C. When addition was oomplote, tho i«?o_hath w/ac ramnvoH anri tho suspension stirred ovemioht at room temnerature After approximately 14 hours, the flask was placed in an ice-bath and crushed ice was added to quench the excess nitrating reagent while maintaining an internal temperature less than 40 "C. The cream-colored suspension was filtered, and the solids were collected by filtration and washed<br>
with a small volume of ice-cold water. The solids were dissolved in methanol and the volatile components were evaporated. The resulting solids were dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven overnight to afford Intermediate 39(a) (79.6 g) in 87% yield. 1H NMR (d4-methanol): 8 8.47 (d, 1H, J= 1.8 Hz), 8.39 (d, 1H, J = 1.8 Hz). LCMS: (M-H) 289.<br>
Step 2. Preparation of Dimethyl 4-bromo-5-nitroisophthalate 39(b)<br>
To a solution of Intermediate 39(a) (77.6 g, 267 mmol) in methanol (500 mL) was added concentrated H2SO4(10 mL). The reaction flask was heated in an oil bath at reflux with stirring for approximately 8 hours at which point LC/MS analysis indicated consumption of starting material. The mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature and white solids began to crystallize in the flask. After sitting overnight, the crystals were collected by filtration and washed with water until the pH of the filtrate was neutral. The crystals (51.9 g) were dried in an Abderhalden drying apparatus over refluxing acetone. The mother liquor was concentrated to provide a second crop (7.58 g) which was combined with the first to afford Intermediate 39(b) (59.4 g) in 70% yield. 1H NMR (d6-DMSO): 5 8.62 (s, 1H), 8.45 (s, 1H), 3.95 (s, 3H), 3.93 (s, 3H). Step 3. Preparation of Dimethyl 5-nitro-4-(phenylethynyl)isophthalate 39(c) A flask containing 1,4-dioxane (16 mL) was purged with nitrogen. Cul (0.12 g, 0.628 mmol) and bis(benzonitrile)dichloropalladium(ll) (0.361 g, 0.942 mmol) were added in portions. Tri-tert-butylphosphine (7.83 mL, 1.88 mmol) was added as a 0.24 M solution in 1,4-dioxane via syringe. The solution was allowed to stir for approximately 5 min at which point diisopropylamine (2.65 mL, 18.9 mmol) was added via syringe. Intermediate 39(b) (5.00 g, 15.7 mmol) was added in one solid portion followed by phenylacetylene (2.08 mL, 18.9 mmol). A precipitate formed immediately. The reaction was capped and stirred at room temperature overnight. The mixture was filtered through diatomaceous earth which was subsequently washed with ethyl acetate to recover any trapped product. The combined filtrate and washings were concentrated and dissolved in a minimal amount of hot ethyl acetate. Hexane was added to recrystallize brown needles which were collected by filtration and further washed with hexane. The needles (4.5 g) were dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight. The mother liquor was concentrated and subjected to silica gel chromatography (10-30% ethyl acetate/hexanes) to yield an additional 1.2 g of a dark brown solid which was combined with the first batch to afford Intermediate 39(c) (5.7 g) in 53% yield. 1H NMR (CDCI3): § 8.73 (d, 1H, J= 1.5 Hz), 8.65 (d, 1H, J= 1.8 Hz), 7.61-7.64 (m, 2H), 7.37-7.46 (m, 3H), 4.03 (s, 3H), 4.00 (s, 3H). LCMS: (M+H) 340. Step 4. Preparation of Dimethyl 2-phenyl-1H-indole-4,6-dicarboxylate 39(d)<br>
To Intermediate 39(c) (6.37 g, 18.8 mmol) was added anhydrous methanol (120 mL). To the resulting slurry was added Tin(ll) chloride (35.6 g, 188 mmol), and the reaction flask was refluxed for 55 hours. Methanol was removed under reduced pressure and the resulting residue was<br><br>
suspended in a small volume of ethyl acetate. Dichloromethane was then added such that the resulting concentration was approximately 95% dichloromethane : 5% ethyl acetate. This suspension was then filtered through a short silica gel plug. The filtrate was concentrated and purified twice by flash silica gel chromatography (5-40% ethyl acetate/dichloromethane) to obtain 3.1 g of Intermediate 39(d) in 53% yield.<br>

Step 5. Preparation of Dimethyl 3-formyl-2-phenyl-1H-indole-4,6-dicarboxylate 39(e) To a solution of Intermediate 39(d) (0.052 g, 0.17 mmol) in anhydrous A/,/V-dimethylformamide (2 mL) at room temperature was added POCI3 (0.2 ml, 2.1 mmol). The resulting violet solution was stirred for 1 hour at room temperature. The mixture was poured into saturated aqueous sodium carbonate (15 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was dried over sodium sulfate, concentrated, and purified by silica gel chromatography (33% ethyl acetate/hexanes) to give Intermediate 39(e) (0.0404 g) in 71% yield.<br>

Step 6. Preparation of Title Compound: 6-Oxo-2-phenyl-5,6-dihydro-1H-[1,2]diazepino[4,5,6-cd]indole-8-carboxylic acid methyl ester<br>
To a solution of Intermediate 39(e) (1.39 g, 4.12 mmol) in anhydrous methanol (70 mL) was added anhydrous hydrazine (0.19 mL, 6.18 mmol). The mixture was refluxed overnight. After cooling, the yellow precipitate was collected by filtration and washed with ice-cold methanol. After drying under vacuum at 60 °C overnight the title compound (1.06 g) was obtained as a bright yellow solid in 72% yield.<br>

Step 1. Preparation of 2-Phenyl-6-[((1R,2R)-2-phenyl-cyclopropanecarbonyl)-amino]-1H-indole-4-carboxylic acid methyl ester 61 (a)<br>
Preparation from Intermediate 7(a) (3.83 g, 12.64 mmol), (1R,2R)-2-phenyl-cyclopropanecarboxylic acid (2.27 mg, 13.97 mmol), triethylamine (3.52 mL, 25.28 mmol), and O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-A/,/V,/V',/V'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (5.31g, 13.97 mmol) in CH2CI2 (6.5 ml) and A/,/V-dimethylformamide (6.5 ml) was carried out analogously to Example<br><br>
11. Extractive work-up from ethyl acetate and saturated aqueous NaHCO3 afforded the crude product as an oil in A/,A/-dimethylfomnamide. Diethyl ether (c.a. 500 mL) and CH2CI2 (80 ml) were added and the mixture was capped and stirred vigorously overnight whereupon the oil was converted to greenish tan solids which were collected by filtration and washed with diethyl ether, methanol, and water. The filtrate was evaporated to an oil and water was added to precipitate a second batch of solids which was also collected by filtration and also washed with methanol and water. Both batches of precipitated and washed solids were combined to give 4.18 g of desired product. In addition, the final fitrate was evaporated and subjected to silica gel chromatography eluting with 1:1 hexane:acetone to give a small amount of additional product (0.275 mg).The combined batches afforded Intermediate 61 (a) (4.46 g, 10.86 mmol) as a tan solid in 86% yield. Step 2. Preparation of 3-formyl-2-phenyl-6-[((1R,2R)-2-phenyl-cyclopropanecarbonyl)-amino]-1/Mndole-4-carboxylic acid methyl ester 61 (b)<br>
Intermediate 61 (a) (4.02 g, 9.79 mmol) was dissolved in CH2CI2 (80 ml) and treated with Vilsmeier reagent (2.94 ml) in a manner similar to that described in step 4 of Example 3. After c.a. 10 min stirring at ice bath temperature followed by 10 min at room tempeature, the volume of CH2CI2 was reduced under vacuum. With ice bath cooling and stirring, Na2CO3 (c.a. 1.2 g) in H2O (10 ml) was added as a paste to the reaction. Additional H2O (20 ml) was then added to the still cool reaction. Methanol (c.a. 100 mL) was added and the reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature, still stirring, whereup the slow evolution of gas was observed. After 4 hours, the volume of the mixture was reduced under vacuum, and CH2CI2 was added to adjust the solvent composition to approximately 4:1 CH2CI2:methanol. Precipitated Na2CO3 was then removed by filtration, and the volume of filtrate was reduced under vacuum leaving mostly methanol as the solvent. Ethyl acetate was added and mixture was then dried (Na2SO4) and filtered and evaporated to give yellow solids. Silica gel chromatography (eluting with 4:1 hexane:acetone increasing to 1:1 hexane:acetone) afforded Intermediate 61(b) (4.2 g, 9.64 mmol) as a yellow powder in c.a. 98% yield.<br>
Step 3. Preparation of Title Compound: (1R,2R)-2-Phenyl-cyclopropanecarboxylic acid (6-oxo-2-phcnyl-5,6-dihydro-1W-[1,2]diazepino[4,5,6-colindol-8-yl)-amide Intermediate 61(b) (4.1 g, 9.41 mmol) acetic acid (0.78 mL, 13.63 mmol) and H2NNH2 • H2O (1.37 mL, 28.23 mmol) in anhydrous methanol (100 mL) were refluxed in manner similar to that described for Example 3, step 5. The resulting precipitate was collected by filtration and washed with a minimum amount of methanol affording the title compound (3.5 g, 8.28 mmol) as a yellow powder in 88% yield.<br>

Step 1. Preparation of 3-(6-Trifluoromethyl-pyridin-3-yl)-acrylic acid methyl ester 113(a)<br>
To a solution of triethyl phosphite in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (25 ml) cooled to 0 °C was added a 60% suspension of sodium hydride in mineral oil (472 mg, 19.7 mmol) in small portions. This mixture was allowed to stir for 30 min at the same low temperature at which point the cooling bath was removed, and the mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature over 60 min. The mixture was cooled again to 0 °C and a solution of 6-trifluoromethyl-3-pyridine carboxaldehyde in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (20 ml) was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm slowly to room temperature overnight. After 19 hours, the reaction mixture was quenched with water (100 ml) and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 50 mL). The combined organic fractions were dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated to a pale green oil. Purification was carried out using flash silica gel chromatography eluting with 5:95 then 1:9 ethyl acetate:hexane. Pure fractions were combined and concentrated to afford Intermediate 113(a) (1.68 g, 6.85 mmol) as a white solid in 42% yield.<br>
Step 2. Preparation of (1,2-rrans)-2-(6-Trifluoromethyl-pyridin-3-yl)-cyclopropanecarboxylic acid113(b)<br>
Trimethylsulfoxonium iodide (574 mg, 2.61 mmol) was added to 60% NaH in mineral oil (63 mg, 2.61 mmol), and the flask was purged with nitrogen. Methyl sulfoxide (10 mL) was added slowly over 20 minutes until evolution of hydrogen ceased. To this milky solution was added Intermediate 113(a) (493 mg, 2.01 mmol) in methyl sulfoxide (15 mL) dropwise. The solution was allowed to stir at room temperature overnight After 26 hours the excess NaH was carefully quenched with water (100 mL). Ethyl ether (100 mL) was added and the layers separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with fresh ethyl ether (3 x 50 mL). The combined ethereal layers were washed with brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo. Flash silica gel<br>
chromatography of the crude residue eluting with 1:9 then 1:4 ethyl acetate:hexane gave two pure fractions that upon combining and concentrating under reduced pressure yielded Intermediate 113(b) (275 mg, 1.06 mmol) as white feathers in 53% yield.<br>
Step 3. Preparation of (1,2-frans)-2-[6-(Trifluoromethyl)pyridin-3-yl]cyclopropanecarboxylic acid113(c)<br>
To a solution of Intermediate 113(b) (275 mg, 1.06 mmol) in a 1:1 mixture of tetrahydrofuran:water (4 ml) was added lithium hydroxide monohydrate (133 mg, 3.18 mmol). The semi-suspension was allowed to stir at room temperature over 2 days. The reaction mixture was acidified with 2M aqueous hydrochloric acid (c.a. 2 ml). The reaction mixture was then concentrated and lyophilized to obtain Intermediate 113(c) as a white powder containing lithium chloride which was carried on directly without further purification.<br>

To a solution of Intermediate 113(c) (85 mg, 0.368 mmol) in methyl sulfoxide (2 ml) was added triethylamine     (0.056     mL,     0.405     mmol)     and     O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-A/,A/,A/',/V-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (154 mg, 0.405 mmol). After c.a. 10 min, the title compound of Example 7 (0.102 g, 0.368 mmol) was added. The reaction was capped and stirred overnight at room temperature. The mixture was subjected to preparative HPLC (20-100% acetonitrile/water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The pure fractions were combined and lyophilized to afford the title compound (27 mg, 0.045 mmol) as an orange powder in 12% yield. 1H-NMR (d6-DMSO): 8 12.11 (b, 1H), 10.50 (b. 1H), 10.39 (b, 1H), 8.71 (b, 1H), 8.15 (b, 2H), 7.90-7.80 (m, 2H), 7.70-7.45 (m, 6H), 2.65-2.55 (m, 1H), 2.27-2.18 (m, 1H), 1.67-1.51 (m, 2H).

Example 275: In Vitro Combination Studies<br>
Cancer cells can be incubated with an antineoplastic agent either alone or in combination with a CHK-1 inhibitor of formula 1. Cell growth data from a combination study (antineoplastic agent together with a fixed concentration of test compound) can be compared to corresponding data obtained from a single agent study (antineoplastic agent without test compound). The concentration of antineoplastic agent causing 50% cell growth inhibition (ICso) can be determined for both single agent treatment and combination treatment. ICso values can be calculated using the linear portion of a semi-log plot of antineoplastic agent concentration versus percent cell growth inhibition. The ratio between the !C50 of the antineoplastic agent alone and the IC^ of the antineoplastic agent in combination with test compound represents the Potentiation Factor 50 (PFso). The PFso can be used to measure the effectiveness of the combination lieatmerit. Combination treatment with an antineoplastic agent and test compounds of formula I can provide PFso values ranging from 2 to 8 in cancer cells.<br>
Cancer cell viability and proliferation can be evaluated using a tetrazolium salt reduction assay (MTT assay). In viable cells, this colorimetric assay can measure mitochondrial reduction of a tetrazolium component into an insoluble formazan product. Conversely, this assay can be used to determine whether or not mitochondrial function is impaired, for instance, by the metabolic events leading to apoptosis or necrosis. Cancer cell lines can be grown in 96-well plates and can be plated in the appropriate medium at a volume of 100 ul/well. Plates can be. incubated for four hours before the addition of test compounds. On the bottom part of the 96 well plate, cells can be treated with increasing concentrations of antineoplastic agent. On the top part of the plate, cells can be treated with increasing concentrations of antineoplastic agent combined with a fixed concentration of test compound. Cells can be incubated at 37°C (5% CO2) for four to six days (depending on cell type). At the end of the incubation, the tetrazolium component can be added to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml, and cells can be incubated for 4 hours at 37°C.   After centrifugation of the plates and removal of medium, the absorbance of the formazan (solubilized in dimethylsulfoxide) can be measured at 540nm.<br>
Antineoplastic agents can include cisplatin, hydroxyurea, gemcitibine, carboplatin, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38), and cytosine p-D-arabinoside.<br>
Cancer cells can refer to the following:<br>

To assess the ability of CHK-1 inhibitors of formula I to augment reduction in tumor volume in combination with gemcitibine in mice, xenograft tumor models using HT-29, MV522 or Colo205 tumor cell lines can be established.<br>
Mice can be randomized (12 mice/group) into treatment groups and used when tumors reach a volume of 150-200 mm3. Mice can undergo a course of intraperitoneal (i.p) injections consisting of vehicle alone, gemcitibine alone or gemcitibine in combination with the test compound of formula I. Tumor volumes can be measured at times ranging from 2 to 25 days. Control can consist of i.p. injection of vehicle at appropriate intervals. Parallel control can consist of i.p. injection of gemcitibine alone at 15 mg/kg to 240 mg/kg at appropriate intervals. Treatment can consist of i.p. injection of gemcitibine (5 mg/kg to 240 mg/kg) at appropriate intervals in combination with i.p. injection of the test compound of formula I (1 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg) at appropriate intervals. At the end of the study, tumor volume (mm3) can be measured. An enhancement in the delay of tumor growth can be observed in the mice treated with gemcitibine in combination with the test compound of formula I versus gemcitibine treatment alone.<br>
