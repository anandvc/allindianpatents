				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a biodegradable lubricants composition for two-stroke engine. This invention particularly relates to biodegradable lubricating oil composition for two-stroke gasoline engine that mainly contains chemically modified non-edible vegetable oils such as mono-esters. In addition to mono-esters, the composition also contains an antioxidant, a metal deactivator, an extreme pressure additive, an antifoaming agent, a pour point depressant, a anti-icing agent, a corrosion inhibitor, a detergent-dispersant and a combustion improver. The product of this invention has utility to produce lower amounts of observable smoke in the exhaust-emission as a result of combustion in a two-stroke gasoline engine, at lower oil-fuel ratio and significantly biodegradable.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART OF THE INVENTION<br>
The two-stroke gasoline engine is a well known power source for outboard motors, snow mobiles, motor boats, motorcycles, scooters, mopeds, gen-sets and a variety of landscaping equipment, e.g., lawn mowers, chain saws, string trimmers and blowers. The widespread use of two stroke gasoline engines is primarily due to their simple design and lightweight construction, their ability to provide high power output with quick starts at low temperature and their relatively low cost. Two-stroke gasoline engines are operated using a mixture of gasoline and a lubricant in prescribed proportions. Because the fuel contains a gasoline<br>
â€¢<br>
lubricant mixture, large amounts of smoke are generated and emitted in the exhaust. The lubricant must provide satisfactory performance characteristics under severe operating conditions. Lubricants for two-stroke gasoline engines are traditionally composed of a mineral oil or synthetic base fluid, performance additive(s) and a solvent, ordinarily a relatively low boiling petroleum distillate, to enhance gasoline/lubricant miscibility.<br>
The technologies developed to date for reducing exhaust emissions from four-stroke car and truck gasoline engines have not been successfully adapted to two-stroke gasoline engines. Hence, there is growing public concern over the high levels of hydrocarbon emissions from these small gasoline engines, as<br><br>
hydrocarbons do not readily biodegrade. The hydrocarbon emissions are a consequence of the basic design of the gasoline engine. Specifically, in the power stroke of a typical two-stroke gasoline engine, air, oil and fuel are drawn into the crankcase as the combined charge is compressed in the space above the piston. In the exhaust stroke, the burnt gases are discharged through exhaust ports, and a fresh combustible charge is transferred from the crankcase to the space above the piston. Because the exhaust ports open before and close after transfer of the fresh combustible charge occurs, as much as 18 % of the fresh charge will 'be discharged unburned with the exhaust. Consequently, hydrocarbon emissions far exceed the level of emissions from a comparable four-cycle engine.<br>
Water-cooled outboard motors exhaust directly into the water, giving rise to water pollution, whereas the other devices mentioned above, which are equipped with air-cooled two-stroke gasoline engines, produce emissions that pose a serious air pollution problem. For example, many two-stroke gasoline engines produce up to fifty times the pollution of truck engines per horsepower hour. Visible smoke emissions in the exhaust from two-stroke gasoline engines have also recently come under increased scrutiny and regulation. In addition, smoky emissions from two-cycle gasoline engines are also becoming a problem from an aesthetic standpoint.<br>
The petroleum based lubricating oils are hydrocarbons consisting of naphthenes,. paraffins, aromatics, polynuclear aromatics and unsaturates. Various additives, which are primarily chemicals of defined composition or structure, are added to the lube oils to improve the physico-chemical properties and performance.<br>
Petroleum based lube oils, generally suffer from many disadvantages such as high toxicity to the environment, poor biodegradability and inconsistent characteristics with change in crude oil composition. The other types of lubricants known as synthetic lubricants are deigned for use in extreme conditions of temperature pressure, radiation or chemical and have excellent lubricity and thermal stability. The synthetic lubricants are relatively costly, also toxic to<br><br>
environment and  are  may  not be  readily  biodegradable.   Commonly  used synthetic compounds for lubricants are<br>
(a)	Poly-glycols,<br>
(b)	polybutenes,<br>
(c)	dibasic acid esters,<br>
(d)	fluoropolymers,<br>
(e)	polyal esters,<br>
(f)	phosphate esters,<br>
(g)	silicones,<br>
(h) poly-alpha olefins (i) other similar fluids.<br>
The above-noted pollution and smoke problems are exacerbated by the presence of volatile organic solvents in the lubricant. Moreover, some of the solvents used as miscibility enhancers have relatively low flash points, thus creating a potential fire risk, which is of particular concern in connection with the storage and transportation of such products.<br>
Certain types of mono-esters from non-edible vegetable oils are useful to generate reduced amounts of observable smoke as a result of combustion in a two-cycle gasoline engine, completely biodegradable, can be used on lower concentration, economical than synthetic esters, compatible to mineral gasoline, are capable' of providing the desirable lubricant properties such as good boundary layer lubrication, high viscosity index, high flash point and low volatility. Low thermo-oxidative stability of vegetable oils can be improved with the help of a suitable chemical modification and additive.<br>
Vegetable oil that is long chain fatty acid triester of glycerol possesses most of the desirable lubricant properties such as high viscosity index, high flash point, low volatility and good boundary lubrication. As per fatty acid typical composition of vegetable oils, it contains unsaturated acids such as oleic C18:1 as a major component. This reflects the fact that some of the carboxylic acids and/or esters are derived from naturally occurring materials and therefore contain a mixture of compounds the major component of which is the stated compound.<br><br>
Non-edible vegetable oil, which are found in abundance in India and have the potential are, Neem - Mellia Azadirachta, Karanja - Pongamia glabra, Ricebran - Oryza sativa, Mahua- Madhuca Indica, Castor - Ricinus communis, Linseed -Flax oil plant Linium usitatissimum (Linacae), Other similar vegetable oil sources.<br>

The absence of n-butenes in the polybutenes significantly reduces smoke emission in exhaust gases generated by the use of the engine oil. Polybutenes such as ULTRAVIS.RTM. which are substantially free of chlorine and have a high degree of terminal unsaturation are particularly preferred.

For four-cycle engines, the composition contains at least one of the copolymer and diester, in addition to a molybdenum or bismuth salt, dimercapto 1,3,4-thiadiazole and sulfur-phosphorous EP and/or chlorinated paraffin.

In the prior art for producing two-stroke gasoline engine lube oils, generally, mineral oils or synthetic fluids or complex ester of fatty acids were used to enhance the performance. Biodegradability, smoke reduction and eco-friendliness were not the main criteria.<br>
There is a need for biodegradable lubricating oil for two-stroke engine, which are derived from renewable resources, work on lower concentration, reduce emission, readily biodegradable, perform better or at least at par with the mineral lube oil and be cost effective.<br><br>
