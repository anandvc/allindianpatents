The compounds of the invention may be synthesised by various methods. For example the compounds of formula 1 may be synthesised as described in Scheme 1.<br>
Thus a compound of formula 1 may be synthesised from a compound of formula 2 by reaction with an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid at amB1ent temperature in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane, chloroform or 1,2-dichloroethane followed by neutralisation of the reaction mixture with an aqueous solution of an iC1-4rganic base such as sodium carbonate, sodium B1carbonate or similar compound. The intermediate thus formed the reacts with an alkylating agent of the formula R8-L, where L is chloride, bromide, iodide or a sulfonate (e.g. mesylate or tosylate) or similar leaving group at a temperature of between amB1ent temperature and 100°C, typically amB1ent temperature, in an organic solvent such as acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, dichloromethane, chloroform or 1,2-dichloroethane in the presence of a tertiary amine base such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylarnine and optionally catalysed by halide salts such as sodium iodide, potassium iodide or tetrabutylammonium iodide.<br>
Alternatively a compound of formula 2, after removal of the t-butoxycarbonyl protecting group as described above, may be reacted with an aldehyde of the formula RCHO at a temperature between amB1ent temperature and 100°C in an organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or ethaC1-4l or mixtures of solvents in the presence of a reducing agent such as borane-pyridine complex, sodium borohydride, sodium (triacetoxy)borohydride, sodium cyaC1-4borohydride or such like, to produce a compound of formula 1 where R8 is CH2R-<br>
In an alternative method compounds of formula 1 maybe obtA1ned from compounds of formula 6 by reaction with a suitable electrophilic species. Compounds of formula 1 where<br><br>
Y is a carbonyl group may be formed by the reaction of compounds of formula 6 with a carboxylic acid derivative of formula R1-C(0)-Z where Z is chloride, hydroxy, alkoxy or acyloxy at a temperature between 0°C and 150°C optionally in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane, chloroform or 1,2-dichloroethane, optionally in the presence of a tertiary amine base such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine and optionally in the presence of a coupling agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Compounds of formula 1 where Y is a carbonyl group and Rl is an amiC1-4 substituent of formula R'-NH- may be formed by the reaction of compounds of formula 6 with an isocyanate of formula R'-N=C=0 under similar conditions. Compounds of formula 1 where Y is a group of formula S(0)q maybe formed from compounds of formula 6 by treatment with compounds of formula of Rl-S(0)q-CI under similar conditions. Compounds of formula 1 where Y is a thiocarbonyl group and Rl is an amiC1-4 substituent of formula R'-NH- may be formed by the reaction of compounds of formula 6 with an isothiocyanate of formula R'-N=C=S under similar conditions. Alternatively compounds of formula 1 where Y is a thiocarbonyl group and Rl is a carbon substituent may be formed by treatment of compounds of formula 1 where Y is a carbonyl group and Rl is a carbon substituent with a suitable thionating agent such as Lawesson's reagent.<br>
In the above procedures, acid derivatives of the formula R1-C(0)-Z, isocyanates of formula R'-N=C=0, isothiocyanates of formula R'-N=C=S and sulfur electrophiles of formula Rl-S(0)q-Cl are either kC1-4wn compounds or may be formed from kC1-4wn compounds by kC1-4wn methods by a person skilled in the art.<br>

Compounds of formula 3 may be obtA1ned by reacting compounds of formula 4 with compounds of formula 10 at a temperature of between 0°C and 100°C in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane, chloroform or 1,2-dichloroethane in the presence of an acid such as hydrochloric acid or trifluoroacetic acid and optionnally a co-solvent such as water, methaC1-4l or ethaC1-4l. The intermediates formed are subsequently treated with a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride, sodium (triacetoxy)borohydride, sodium cyaC1-4borohydride, triethylsilane or similar at amB1ent temperature in organic solvent such as ethaC1-4l or chloroform or with a nucleophile R3-M (where M is a metallic species; R3-M is for example<br><br>
a Grignard reagent). The basic procedure is described in Tetrahedron (1997), 53, 10983-10992.<br>
Similarly, compounds of formula 6 may be synthesised by reacting compounds of formula 7 with compounds of formula 10 using the conditions described above.<br>
Compounds of formula 4 may be obtA1ned from compounds of formula 5 by reaction with a 1-alkoxy substituted phosphonium salt of formula 9 such as<br>
methoxymethyl(triphenyl)phosphonium chloride and a base such as potassium tert-butoxide at a temperature of 0°C to 80°C in tetrahydrofuran.<br>
Similarly, compounds of formula 7 may be synthesised from compounds of formula S using the conditions described above.<br>
Compounds of formula 5, 8 and 10 are either kC1-4wn compounds or may be formed from kC1-4wn compounds by kC1-4wn methods by a person skilled in the art.<br>
CertA1n compounds of formula 2, 3 and 6 are C1-4vel and as such form a further aspect of the invention.<br><br><br><br>
In an alternative melhod a compound of formula 1 wherein Al, A2, A3, A4, B2, B3 and B4 are H and B1 is OH may be obtA1ned from a compound of formula 12 by removal of the t-butoxycarbonyi protecting group and reaction with an alkylating agent R8-L as described previously. A Compound of formula 12 maybe obtA1ned from an intermediate of formula 11 by reaction with an hydroborating agent such as borane in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran at a temperature of between 0°C to 80°C, followed by treatment with an oxidising agent such as hydrogen peroxide in the presence of water and a base such as sodium hydroxide at a temperature of between 0°C to 100°C (Scheme 2).<br>
The skilled person will readily recognise that it is possible to convert one compound of formula 12 to other compounds of formula 1.<br><br>
In aC1-4ther alternative method, a compound of formula 11 may be reacted with a suitable fluorinating species, such as Selectfluor®, followed by reaction with a reducing agent such as triethylsilane in the presence of an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid to provide a compound of formula 13 or a compound of formula 14. Compounds of formula 13 (or 14) may be converted into compounds of formula 1 wherein A1, A2, A3, A4, B2, B3 and B4 are H and B1 is F (i.e. A1, A2, A3, A4, B3 and B4 are H, B1 and B2 are F) by reaction with an alkylating agent of the formula R8-L as described previously (Scheme 3).<br><br><br>
Compounds of formula 11 may be synthesised by the method outlined on Scheme 4.<br>
Thus a compound of formula 11 may be synthesised from a compound of formula 15 by reacting with an electrophilic species as described previously.<br>
A compound of formula 15 may be prepared from a compound of formula 16 by treatment with a suitable base such as potassium carbonate at a temperature of between 0°C to 80°C in an organic solvent such as methaC1-4l or ethaC1-4l in comB1nation with water.<br>

Compounds of formula 17 may be synthesised by coupling compounds of formula IS with the kC1-4wn alcohol 19 {J. Org. Chem. 2001,66, 5545-5551) under MitsuC1-4bu conditions, typically using a phosphine such as triphenylphosphine and an azo compound such as diethylazodicarboxylate or diisopropylazodicarboxylate in an organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or toluene at a temperature of between 0°C to 80°C.<br>
Compounds of formula 18 are either kC1-4wn compounds or may be formed from kC1-4wn compounds by kC1-4wn methods by a person skilled in the art.<br><br><br><br>

The invention therefore provides a method of combating and controlling insects, acarines, nematodes or molluscs which comprises applying an insecticidally, acaricidally, nematicidally or molluscicidally effective amount of a compound of formula (I), or a composition contA1ning a compound of formula (I), to a pest, a loC1-4s of pest, or to a plant susceptible to attack by a pest, The compounds of formula (I) are preferably used agA1nst insects, acarines or nematodes.<br>
The term "plant" as used herein includes seedlings, bushes and trees.<br>
In order to apply a compound of formula (I) as an insecticide, acaricide, nematicide or molluscicide to a pest, a loC1-4s of pest, or io a piani susceptiB1e to attack by a pest, a compound of formula (I) is usually formulated into a composition which includes, in addition to the compound of formula (I), a suitable inert diluent or carrier and, optionally, a surface active agent (SFA). SFAs are chemicals which are able to modify the properties of an interface (for example, liquid/solid, liquid/A1r or liquid/liquid interfaces) by lowering the interfacial tension and thereby leading to changes in other properties (for example dispersion, emulsification and wetting). It is preferred that A1l compositions (both solid and liquid formulations) comprise, by weight, 0.0001 to 95%, more preferably 1 to 85%, for example 5 to 60%, of a compound of formula (I). The composition is generally used for the control of pests such that a compound of formula (I) is applied at a rate of from 0,1 g to 10kg per hectare, preferably from lg to 6kg per hectare, more preferably from 1 g to 1kg per hectare.<br>
When used in a seed dressing, a compound of formula (I) is used at a rate of O.OOOIg to 1 Og (for example 0.001 g or 0.05g), preferably 0.005g to 1 Og, more preferably 0.005g to 4g. per kilogram of seed.<br><br>
In aC1-4ther aspect the present invention provides an insecticidal, acaricidal, nematicidal or molluscicidal composition comprising an insecticidally, acaricidally, nematicidally or molluscicidally effective amount of a compound of formula (I) and a suitable carrier or diluent therefor. The composition is preferably an insecticidal, acaricidal, nematicidal or molluscicidal composition.<br>
In a still further aspect the invention provides a method of combating and controlling pests at a loC1-4s which comprises treating the pests or the loC1-4s of the pests with an insecticidally, acaricidally, nematicidally or molluscicidally effective amount of a composition comprising a compound of formula (I). The compounds of formula (I) are preferably used agA1nst insects, acarines or nematodes.<br>
The compositions can be chosen from a number of formulation types, including dustable powders (DP), soluble powders (SP), water soluble granules (SG), water dispersible granules (WG), wettable powders (WP), granules (GR) (slow or fast release), soluble concentrates (SL), oil miscible liquids (OL), ultra low volume liquids (UL), emulsifiable concentrates (EC), dispersible concentrates (DC), emulsions (both oil in water (EW) and water in oil (EO)), micro-emulsions (ME), suspension concentrates (SC), aerosols, fogging/smoke formulations, capsule suspensions (CS) and seed treatment formulations. The formulation type chosen in any instance will depend upon the partiC1-4lar purpose envisaged and the physical, chemical and B1ological properties of the compound of formula (I).<br>
Dustable powders (DP) may be prepared by mixing a compound of formula (I) with one or more solid diluents (for example natural clays, kaolin, pyrophyllite, bentonite, alumina, montmorillonite, kieselguhr, chalk, diatomaceous earths, calcium phosphates, calcium and magnesium carbonates, sulphur, lime, flours, talc and other organic and iC1-4rganic solid carriers) and mechanically grinding the mixture to a fine powder.<br>
Soluble powders (SP) may be prepared by mixing a compound of formula (I) with one or more water-soluble iC1-4rganic salts (such as sodium B1carbonate, sodium carbonate or magnesium sulphate) or one or more water-soluble organic solids (such as a polysaccharide) and, optionally, one or more wetting agents, one or more dispersing agents or a mixture of sA1d agents to improve water dispersiB1lity/soluB1lity. The mixture is then ground to a fine powder. Similar compositions may also be granulated to form water soluble granules (SG).<br>
Wettable powders (WP) may be prepared by mixing a compound of formula (I) with one or more solid diluents or carriers, one or more wetting agents and, preferably, one or<br><br>
more dispersing agents and, optionally, one or more suspending agents to facilitate the dispersion in liquids. The mixture is then ground to a fine powder. Similar compositions may also be granulated to form water dispersible granules (WG).<br>
Granules (GR) may be formed either by granulating a mixture of a compound of formula (I) and one or more powdered solid diluents or carriers, or from pre-formed blank granules by absorB1ng a compound of formula (I) (or a solution thereof, in a suitable agent) in a porous granular material (such as pumice, attapulgite clays, fuller's earth, kieselguhr, diatomaceous earths or ground corn cobs) or by adsorB1ng a compound of formula (I) (or a solution thereof, in a suitable agent) on to a hard core material (such as sands, silicates, mineral carbonates, sulphates or phosphates) and drying if necessary. Agents which are commonly used to A1d absorption or adsorption include solvents (such as aliphatic and aromatic petroleum solvents, alcohols, ethers, ketones and esters) and sticking agents (such as polyvinyl acetates, polyvinyl alcohols, dextrins, sugars and vegetable oils). One or more other additives may also be included in granules (for example an emulsifying agent, wetting agent or dispersing agent).<br>
Dispersible Concentrates (DC) may be prepared by dissolving a compound of formula (I) in water or an organic solvent, such as a ketone, alcohol or glycol ether. These solutions may contA1n a surface active agent (for example to improve water dilution or prevent crystallisation in a spray tank).<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates (EC) or oil-in-water emulsions (EW) may be prepared by dissolving a compound of formula (I) in an organic solvent (optionally contA1ning one or more wetting agents, one or more emulsifying agents or a mixture of sA1d agents).. Suitable organic solvents for use in ECs include aromatic hydrocarbons (such as alkylbenzenes or alkylnaphthalenes, exemplified by SOLVESSO 100, SOLVESSO 150 and SOLVESSO 200; SOLVESSO is a Registered Trade Mark), ketones (such as cyclohexaC1-4ne or methylcyclohexaC1-4ne) and alcohols (such as benzyl alcohol, furfuryl alcohol or butaC1-4l), N-alkylpyrrolidones (such as N-methylpyrrolidone or N-octylpyrrolidone), dimethyl amides of fatty acids (such as C8-C10 fatty acid diethylamide) and chlorinated hydrocarbons. An EC product may spontaneously emulsify on addition to water, to produce an emulsion with sufficient staB1lity to allow spray application through appropriate equipment. Preparation of an EW involves obtA1ning a compound of formula (I) either as a liquid (if it is C1-4t a liquid at room temperature, it may be melted at a reasonable temperature, typically below 70°C) or hi<br><br>
solution (by dissolving it in an appropriate solvent) and then emulsifiying the resultant liquid or solution into water contA1ning one or more SFAs, under high shear, to produce an emulsion. Suitable solvents for use in EWs include vegetable oils, chlorinated hydrocarbons (such as chlorobenzenes), aromatic solvents (such as alkylbenzenes or alkylnaphtfialenes) and other appropriate organic solvents which have a low soluB1lity in water.<br>
Microemulsions (ME) may be prepared by mixing water with a blend of one or more solvents with one or more SFAs, to produce spontaneously a thermodynamically stable isotropic liquid formulation. A compound of formula (I) is present initially in either the water or the solvent/SFA blend. Suitable solvents for use in MEs include those hereinbefore described for use in in ECs or in EWs. An ME may be either an oil-in-water or a water-in-oil system (which system is present may be determined by conductivity measurements) and may be suitable for mixing water-soluble and oil-soluble pesticides in the same formulation. An ME is suitable for dilution into water, either remA1ning as a microemulsion or forming a conventional oil-in-water emulsion.<br>
Suspension concentrates (SC) may comprise aqueous or C1-4n-aqueous suspensions of finely divided insoluble solid particles of a compound of formula (I). SCs may be prepared by ball or bead milling the solid compound of formula (I) in a suitable medium, optionally with one or more dispersing agents, to produce a fine particle suspension of the compound. One or more wetting agents may be included in the composition and a suspending agent may be included to reduce the rate at which the particles settle. Alternatively, a compound of formula (I) may be dry milled and added to water, contA1ning agents hereinbefore described, to produce the desired end product.<br>
Aerosol formulations comprise a compound of formula (I) and a suitable propellant (for example n-butane). A compound of formula (I) may also be dissolved or dispersed in a suitable medium (for example water or a water miscible liquid, such as n-propaC1-4l) to provide compositions for use in C1-4n-pressurised, hand-actuated spray pumps.<br>
A compound of formula (I) may be mixed in the dry state with a pyrotechnic mixture to form a composition suitable for generating, in an enclosed space, a smoke contA1ning the compound.<br>
Capsule suspensions (CS) may be prepared in a manner similar to the preparation of EW formulations but with an additional polymerisation stage such that an aqueous dispersion of oil droplets is obtA1ned, in which each oil droplet is encapsulated by a polymeric shell and<br><br>
contA1ns a compound of formula (I) and, optionally, a carrier or diluent therefor. The polymeric shell may be produced by either an interfacial polycondensation reaction or by a coacervation procedure. The compositions may provide for controlled release of the compound of formula (I) and they may be used for seed treatment. A compound of formula (I) may also be formulated in a B1odegradable polymeric matrix to provide a slow, controlled release of the compound.<br>
A composition may include one or more additives to improve the B1ological performance of the composition (for example by improving wetting, retention or distribution on surfaces; resistance to rA1n on treated surfaces; or uptake or moB1lity of a compound of formula (I)). Such additives include surface active agents, spray additives based on oils, for example certA1n mineral oils or natural plant oils (such as soy bean and rape seed oil), and blends of these with other B1o-enhancing adjuvants (ingredients which may A1d or modify the action of a compound of formula (I)).<br>
A compound of formula (I) may also be formulated for use as a seed treatment, for example as a powder composition, including a powder for dry seed treatment (DS), a water soluble powder (SS) or a water dispersible powder for slurry treatment (WS), or as a liquid composition, including a flowable concentrate (FS), a solution (LS) or a capsule suspension (CS). The preparations of DS, SS? WS. FS and LS compositions are very similar to those of, respectively, DP, SP, WP, SC and DC compositions described above. Compositions for treating seed may include an agent for assisting the adhesion of the composition to the seed (for example a mineral oil or a film-forming barrier).<br>
Wetting agents, dispersing agents and emulsifying agents may be surface SFAs of the cationic, anionic, amphoteric or C1-4n-ionic type.<br>
Suitable SFAs of the cationic type include quaternary ammonium compounds (for example cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide), imidazolines and amine salts.<br>
Suitable anionic SFAs include alkali metals salts of fatty acids, salts of aliphatic moC1-4esters of sulphuric acid (for example sodium lauryl sulphate), salts of sulphonated aromatic compounds (for example sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate, calcium dodecylbenzenesulphonate, butylnaphthalene sulphonate and mixtures of sodium di-isopropyl- and tri-isopropyl-naphthalene sulphonates), ether sulphates, alcohol ether sulphates (for example sodium laureth-3-sulphate), ether carboxylates (for example sodium laureth-3-carboxylate), phosphate esters (products from the reaction between one or more<br><br>

A compound of formula (I) may be applied by any of the kC1-4wn means of applying pesticidal compounds. For example, it may be applied, formulated or unformulated, to the pests or to a loC1-4s of the pests (such as a haB1tat of the pests, or a growing plant liable to infestation by the pests) or to any part of the plant, including the foliage, stems, branches or roots, to the seed before it is planted or to other media in which plants are growing or are to be planted (such as soil surrounding the roots, the soil generally, paddy water or hydroponic C1-4lture systems), directly or it may be sprayed on, dusted on, applied by dipping, applied as a cream or paste formulation, applied as a vapour or applied through distribution or incorporation of a composition (such as a granular composition or a composition packed in a water-soluble bag) in soil or an aqueous environment.<br>
A compound of formula (I) may also be injected into plants or sprayed onto<br>
vegetation using electrodynamic spraying techniques or other low volume methods, or<br>
applied by land or aerial irrigation systems.<br>
	Compositions for use as aqueous preparations (aqueous solutions or dispersions) are<br>
generally supplied in the form of a concentrate contA1ning a high proportion of the active ingredient, the concentrate being added to water before use. These concentrates, which may<br><br>
include DCs, SCs, ECs, EWs, MEs SGs, SPs, WPs, WGs and CSs, are often required to withstand storage for prolonged periods and, after such storage, to be capable of addition to water to form aqueous preparations which remA1n homogeneous for a sufficient time to enable them to be applied by conventional spray equipment. Such aqueous preparations may contA1n varying amounts of a compound of formula (I) (for example 0.0001 to 10%, by weight) depending upon the purpose for which they are to be used.<br>
A compound of formula (I) may be used in mixtures with fertilisers (for example nitrogen-, potassium- or phosphorus-contA1ning fertilisers). Suitable formulation types include granules of fertiliser. The mixtures suitably contA1n up to 25% by weight of the compound of formula (I).<br>

	Some mixtures may comprise active ingredients which have significantly different<br>
physical, chemical or B1ological properties such that they do C1-4t easily lend themselves to the same conventional formulation type. In these cirC1-4mstances other formulation types may be prepared. For example, where one active ingredient is a water insoluble solid and the other a water insoluble liquid, it may nevertheless be possible to disperse each active ingredient in     the same continuous aqueous phase by dispersing the solid active ingredient as a suspension (using a preparation analogous to that of an SC) but dispersing the liquid active ingredient as an emulsion (using a preparation analogous to that of an EW). The resultant composition is a suspoemulsion (SE) formulation.<br><br>
