				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>The present invention concerns molecules and a process in which one or more biologically active peptides are incorporated into an Fc domain. In this invention, pharmacologically active compounds may be prepared by a process comprising (a) selecting at least one peptide that modulates the activity of a protein of interest; and (b) preparing a pharmacologic agent comprising an amino acid sequence of the selected peptide in a loop region of an Fc domain. This process may be employed to modify an Fc domain that is already linked through an N- or C-terminus or sidechain to a peptide or to a polypeptide (e.g., etanercept). This process may also be employed to modify an Fc domain that is part of an antibody (e.g., adalimumab, epratuzumab, infliximab, Herceptin®, and the like). In this way, different molecules can be produced that have additional functionalities, such as a binding domain to a different epitope or an additional binding domain to the precursor molecule&#x27;s existing epitope. The peptide can be selected, for example, by phage display, E. coli display, ribosome display, RNA-peptide screening, yeast-based screening, chemical-peptide screening, rational design, or protein structural analysis.</td>

This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/612,680, filed September 24,<br>
2004, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The success of the drug Enbrel® (etanercept) brought to fruition the promise of therapeutic agents<br>
modified with the constant domain of an antibody. Antibodies comprise two functionally independent parts, a<br>
variable domain known as "Fab", which binds antigen, and a constant domain known as "Fc", which links to<br>
such effector functions as complement activation and attack by phagocytic cells. An Fc has a long serum halflife,<br>
whereas an Fab is short-lived. Capon et al. (1989), Nature 337: 525-31. When constructed together with a<br>
therapeutic protein, an Fc domain can provide longer half-life or incorporate such functions as Fc receptor<br>
binding, protein A binding, complement fixation and perhaps even placental transfer. Id. Table 1 summarizes<br>
use of Fc fusion proteins known in the art.<br>
Table 1—Fc fusion with therapeutic proteins<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Linslev(1991). J. EXD. Med. 174:561-9<br>
A much different approach to development of therapeutic agents is peptide library screening. The<br>
interaction of a protein ligand with its receptor often takes place at a relatively large interface. However, as<br>
demonstrated for human growth hormone and its receptor, only a few key residues at the interface contribute<br>
to most of the binding energy. Clackson et al. (1995), Science 267: 383-6. The bulk of the protein ligand merely<br>
displays the binding epitopes in the right topology or serves functions unrelated to binding. Thus, molecules<br>
of only "peptide" length (2 to 40 amino acids) can bind to the receptor protein of a given large protein ligand.<br>
Such peptides may mimic the bioactivity of the large protein ligand ("peptide agonists") or, through<br>
competitive binding, inhibit the bioactivity of the large protein ligand ("peptide antagonists").<br>
Phage display peptide libraries have emerged as a powerful method in identifying such peptide<br>
agonists and antagonists. See, for example, Scott etal. (1990), Science 249: 386; Devlin etal. (1990), Science 249:<br>
-2.-<br>
404-; U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409, issued June 29, 1993; U.S. Pat. No. 5,733,731, issued March 31, 1998; U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,498,530, issued March 12, 1996; U.S. Pat. No. 5,432,018, issued July 11, 1995; U.S. Pat. No. 5,338,665, issued<br>
August 16,1994; U.S. Pat. No. 5,922,545, issued July 13,1999; WO 96/40987, published December 19,1996; and<br>
WO 98/15833, published April 16,1998 (each of which is incorporated by reference). In such libraries, randompeptide sequences are displayed by fusion with coat proteins of filamentous phage. Typically, the displayed<br>
peptides are affinity-eluted against an antibody-immobilized extracellular domain of a receptor. The retained<br>
phages may be enriched by successive rounds of affinity purification and repropagation. The best binding<br>
peptides may be sequenced to identify key residues within one or more structurally related families of<br>
peptides. See, e.g., Cwirla et al. (1997), Science 276: 1696-9, in which two distinct families were identified. The<br>
peptide sequences may also suggest which residues may be safely replaced by alanine scanning or by<br>
mutagenesis at the DNA level. Mutagenesis libraries may be created and screened to further optimize the<br>
sequence of the best binders. Lowman (1997), Ann. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 26: 401-<br>
Other methods compete with phage display in peptide research. A peptide library can be fused to the<br>
carboxyl terminus of the lac represser and expressed in E. coli. Another E. coli-based method allows display on<br>
the cell's outer membrane by fusion with a peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL). Hereinafter, these and<br>
related methods are collectively referred to as "E. coli display." Another biological approach to screening<br>
soluble peptide mixtures uses yeast for expression and secretion. See Smith et al. (1993), Mol. Pharmacol. 43:<br>
741-8. Hereinafter, the method of Smith et al. and related methods are referred to as "yeast-based screening."<br>
In another method, translation of random RNA is halted prior to ribosome release, resulting in a library of<br>
polypeptides with their associated RNA still attached. Hereinafter, this and related methods are collectively<br>
referred to as "ribosome display." Other methods employ chemical linkage of peptides to RNA; see, for<br>
example, Roberts &amp; Szostak (1997), Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 94: 12297-303. Hereinafter, this and related<br>
methods are collectively referred to as "RNA-peptide screening." Chemically derived peptide libraries have<br>
been developed in which peptides are immobilized on stable, non-biological materials, such as polyethylene<br>
rods or solvent-permeable resins. Another chemically derived peptide library uses photolithography to scan<br>
peptides immobilized on glass slides. Hereinafter, these and related methods are collectively referred to as<br>
"chemical-peptide screening." Chemical-peptide screening may be advantageous in that it allows use of Damino<br>
acids and other unnatural analogues, as well as non-peptide elements. Both biological and chemical<br>
methods are reviewed in Wells &amp; Lowman (1992), Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 3: 355-62.<br>
In the case of known bioactive peptides, rational design of peptide ligands with favorable therapeutic properties can be completed. In such an approach, one makes stepwise changes to a peptide sequence and<br>
determines the effect of the substitution upon bioactivity or a predictive biophysical property of the peptide<br>
(e.g., solution structure). Hereinafter, these techniques are collectively referred to as "rational design." In one<br>
such technique, one makes a series of peptides in which one replaces a single residue at a time with alanine.<br>
This technique is commonly referred to as an "alanine walk" or an "alanine scan." When two residues<br>
(contiguous or spaced apart) are replaced, it is referred to as a "double alanine walk." The resultant amino acid<br>
substitutions can be used alone or in combination to result in a new peptide entity with favorable therapeutic<br>
properties.<br>
Structural analysis of protein-protein interaction may also be used to suggest peptides that mimic the<br>
binding activity of large protein ligands. In such an analysis, the crystal structure may suggest the identity and<br>
relative orientation of critical residues of the large protein ligand, from which a peptide may be designed. See,<br>
e.g., Takasaki et al. (1997), Nature Biotech. 15: 1266-70. Hereinafter, these and related methods are referred to<br>
as "protein structural analysis." These analytical methods may also be used to investigate the interaction<br>
between a receptor protein and peptides selected by phage display, which may suggest further modification of<br>
the peptides to increase binding affinity.<br>
Conceptually, one may discover peptide mimetics of any protein using phage display and the other<br>
methods mentioned above. These methods have been used for epitope mapping, for identification of critical<br>
amino acids in protein-protein interactions, and as leads for the discovery of new therapeutic agents. E.g.,<br>
Cortese et al. (1996), Curr. Opin. Biotech. 7: 616-21. Peptide libraries are now being used most often in<br>
immunological studies, such as epitope mapping. Kreeger (1996), The Scientist 10(13): 19-20.<br>
Of particular interest here is use of peptide libraries and other techniques in the discovery of<br>
pharmacologically active peptides. A number of such peptides identified in the art are summarized in Table 2.<br>
The peptides are described in the listed publications, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference. The<br>
pharmacologic activity of the peptides is described, and in many instances is followed by a shorthand term<br>
therefore in parentheses. Some of these peptides have been modified (e.g., to form C-terminally cross-linked<br>
dimers). Typically, peptide libraries were screened for binding to a receptor for a pharmacologically active<br>
protein (e.g., EPO receptor). In at least one instance (CTLA4), the peptide library was screened for binding to a monoclonal antibody.<br>
Table 2—Pharmacologically active peptides<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
linear GLP-1 Diabetes, metabolic syndrome<br>
Peptides identified by peptide library screening were for a long time regarded simply as "leads" in<br>
development of therapeutic agents rather than as therapeutic agents themselves. Like other proteins and<br>
peptides, they would be rapidly removed in vivo either by renal filtration, cellular clearance mechanisms in<br>
th-i^eticuloendothelial system, or proteolytic degradation. Francis (1992), Focus on Growth Factors 3: 4-11. As<br>
a result, the art used the identified peptides to validate drug targets or as scaffolds for design of organic<br>
compounds that might not have been as easily or as quickly identified through chemical library screening.<br>
Lowman (1997), Ann. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 26: 401-24; Kay etal. (1998), Drug Disc. Today 3: 370-8.<br>
A more recent development is fusion of randomly generated peptides with the Fc domain. See U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 6,660,843, issued December 9, 2003 to Feige et al. (incorporated by reference in its entirety). Such<br>
molecules have come to be known as "peptibodies." They include one or more peptides linked to the Nterminus,<br>
C-terminus, amino acid sidechains, or to more than one of these sites. Peptibody technology enables<br>
design of therapeutic agents that incorporate peptides that target one or more ligands or receptors, tumorhoming<br>
peptides, membrane-transporting peptides, and the like. Peptibody technology has proven useful in<br>
design of a number of such molecules, including linear and disulfide-constrained peptides, "tandem peptide<br>
multimers" (i.e., more than one peptide on a single chain of an Fc domain) . See, for example, U.S. Pat. No.<br>
6,660,843; U.S. Pat. App. No. 2003/0195156, published Oct. 16, 2003 (corresponding to WO 02/092620,<br>
published Nov. 21, 2002); U.S. Pat. App. No. 2003/0176352, published Sept. 18, 2003 (corresponding to WO<br>
03/031589, published April 17, 2003); U.S. Ser. No. 09/422,838, filed October 22, 1999 (corresponding to WO<br>
00/24770, published May 4, 2000); U.S. Pat. App. No. 2003/0229023, published December 11, 2003; WO<br>
03/057134, published July 17, 2003; U.S. Pat. App. No. 2003/0236193, published December 25, 2003<br>
(corresponding to PCT/US04/010989, filed April 8, 2004); U.S. Ser. No. 10/666,480, filed September 18, 2003<br>
(corresponding to WO 04/026329, published April 1, 2004), each of which is hereby incorporated by reference<br>
in its entirety. The art would benefit from further technology enabling such rational design of polypeptide<br>
therapeutic agents.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention concerns a process in which at least one biologically active peptide is<br>
incorporated as an internal sequence into an Fc domain. Such an internal sequence may be added by insertion<br>
(i.e., between amino acids in the previously existing Fc domain) or by replacement of amino acids in the<br>
previously existing Fc domain (i.e., removing amino acids in the previously existing Fc domain and adding<br>
peptide amino acids). In the latter case, the number of peptide amino acids added need not correspond to the<br>
number of amino acids removed from the previously existing Fc domain; for example, this invention concerns<br>
a molecule in which 10 amino acids are removed and 15 amino acids are added. In this invention,<br>
pharmacologically active compounds are prepared by a process comprising:<br>
a) selecting at least one peptide that modulates the activity of a protein of interest; and<br>
b) preparing a pharmacologic agent comprising an amino acid sequence of the selected peptide as<br>
an internal sequence of an Fc domain.<br>
This process may be employed to modify an Fc domain that is already linked through an N- or C-terminus or<br>
sidechain to a polypeptide (e.g., etanercept) or to a peptide (e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. App. Nos.<br>
2003/0195156, 2003/0176352, 2003/0229023, and 2003/0236193; WO 00/24770; WO 04/026329). The process<br>
described throughout may also be employed to modify an Fc domain that is part of an antibody (e.g.,<br>
adadimumab, epratuzumab, infliximab, Herceptin®, and the like). In this way, different molecules can be<br>
produced that have additional functionalities, such as a binding domain to a different epitope or an additional<br>
binding domain to the precursor molecule's existing epitope. The peptide can be selected, for example, by<br>
phage display (which is preferred), E. coli display, ribosome display, RNA-peptide screening, yeast-based<br>
screening, chemical-peptide screening, rational design, or protein structural analysis or may be a naturally<br>
occurring peptide (e.g. PTH, GLP-1).<br>
The invention further relates to molecules comprising an Fc domain modified to comprise a peptide as<br>
an internal sequence (preferably in a loop region) of the Fc domain. Molecules comprising an internal peptide<br>
sequence are referred to throughout as "Fc internal peptibodies" or "Fc internal peptide molecules." These<br>
molecules are further described herein below.<br>
The Fc internal peptide molecules may include more than one peptide sequence in tandem in <br>
particular internal region, and they may include further peptides in other internal regions. While the putative<br>
loop regions are preferred, insertions in any other non-terminal domains of the Fc are also considered part of<br>
this invention. Variants and derivatives of the above compounds (described below) are also encompassed by<br>
this invention.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be prepared by standard synthetic methods, recombinant DNA<br>
techniques, or any other methods of preparing peptides and fusion proteins.<br>
The primary use contemplated for Fc internal peptide molecules is as therapeutic or prophylactic<br>
agents. A selected peptide may have activity comparable to—or even greater than—the natural ligand<br>
mimicked by the peptide. In addition, certain natural ligand-based therapeutic agents might induce antibodies<br>
against the patient's own endogenous ligand. In contrast, the unique sequence of the vehicle-linked peptide<br>
avoids this pitfall by having little or typically no sequence identity with the natural ligand. Furthermore, the<br>
Fc internal peptibodies may have advantages in refolding and purification over N- or C-terminally linked Fc<br>
molecules. Further still, Fc internal peptibodies may be more stable in both thermodynamically, due to the<br>
stabilization of chimeric domains, and chemically, due to increased resistance to proteolytic degradation from<br>
amino- and carboxy-peptidases. Fc internal peptibodies may also exhibit improved pharmacokinetic<br>
properties.<br>
Although mostly contemplated as therapeutic agents, compounds of this invention may also be useful<br>
in screening for such agents. For example, one could use an Fc internal peptibody (e.g., Fc-loop-SH2 domain<br>
peptide) in an assay employing anti-Fc coated plates. Fc internal peptibodies may make insoluble peptides<br>
soluble and thus useful in a number of assays.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be used for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes by formulating<br>
them with appropriate pharmaceutical carrier materials and administering an effective amount to a patient,<br>
such as a human (or other mammal) in need thereof. Other related aspects are also included in the instant<br>
invention.<br>
Numerous additional aspects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon<br>
consideration of the figures and detailed description of the invention.<br>
Description of the Figures<br>
Figures 1A, IB and 1C show loop regions of Fc domains that may be modified in accordance with this<br>
invention. In these structural representations of the CH2 and CHS domains of Fc, the loop regions may be<br>
considered any part of the model not shown as p-sheet (flat arrows) or a-helix (cylinder).<br>
Figure 1A shows the monomeric rat IgG2a Fc domain (Protein Database file #1I1C,<br>
http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/). This figure shows a three dimensional model of rat IgG2a Fc domain monomer<br>
from x-ray diffraction crystal structure (pdb #1I1C). Potential Fc loop insertion sites are shown for both CH2<br>
and CH3 domains with the preferred CHS domain Fc loop insertion site specifically identified.<br>
Figure IB shows the monomeric murine IgGl Fc domain (Protein Database file #1IGY). This figure<br>
shows a three-dimensional model of murine IgGl Fc domain monomer from x-ray diffraction crystal structure<br>
(pdb #1IGY). Potential Fc loop insertion sites are shown for both CH2 and CHS domains with the preferred<br>
CH3 domain Fc loop insertion site specifically identified.<br>
Figure 1C shows the monomeric human IgGl Fc domain (Protein Database file #1H3T). This figure<br>
shows a three-dimensional model of human IgGl Fc domain monomer from x-ray diffraction crystal structure<br>
(pdb #1H3T). Potential Fc loop insertion sites are shown for both CH2 and CHS domains with the preferred<br>
CH3 domain Fc loop insertion site specifically identified.<br>
These structures illustrate the high degree of homology in the secondary and tertiary structural<br>
conformations within the Fc domains of different IgG subtypes and between species. The x-ray crystal<br>
structure coordinates for these structures can be found in the RCSB Protein Data Bank<br>
(http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/).<br>
Figure 2A shows a sequence of human IgGl Fc sequence (SEQ ID NO: 599) used for peptibody fusions<br>
with predicted loop sequences in boldface. Figure 2A shows, in the context of the human IgGl sequence used<br>
for this invention, the Fc loop regions in boldface (SEQ ID NOS: 621, 622, 624, 625, 627, 628, 630, 632, 634, and<br>
636), which are suggested by the structures shown in Figures 1A, IB and 1C. Any, or all of the sites shown in<br>
boldface may be suitable for full or partial replacement by or insertion of peptide sequences and are<br>
considered part of this invention. Specifically preferred internal sites are underlined (SEQ ID NOS: 623, 626,<br>
629, 631, 633, 635, and 637). One preferred site is SEQ ID NO: 631, between Leui39 and Thr14o in the DELTK<br>
(SEQ ID NO: 630) loop. Potential loop sites in other Ig subtypes are understood in the art based on the<br>
alignments provided in Figures 2B and 2C.<br>
Figures 2B and 2C show a sequence alignment of human Fc domains from IgA, IgM and IgG<br>
subclasses. Figures 2B and 2C show exemplary amino acid sequences (SEQ ID NOS: 600 to 607) of human Fc<br>
regions from IgA, IgM and IgG subtypes that may be useful in this invention. Also shown in Figures 2B and<br>
2C is a consensus sequence (SEQ ID NO: 608).<br>
Figures 2B and 2C also show in boldface the preferred internal sites for peptide addition that<br>
correspond to those of the Fc sequence shown in Figure 2A (SEQ ID NO: 599). In particular, Figures 2B and 2C<br>
show as such preferred sites the following:<br>
• SEQ ID NO: 621 as shown in boldface within SEQ ID NOS: 603 to 608;<br>
• SEQ ID NO: 622 within SEQ ID NOS: 603 to 606 and 608;<br>
• SEQ ID NO: 638 within SEQ ID NO: 607;<br>
. SEQ ID NO: 624 within SEQ ID NO: 603 to 608;<br>
• SEQ ID NO: 625 within SEQ ID NOS: 603 and 604;<br>
• SEQ ID NO: 639 within SEQ ID NOS: 605 to 608;<br>
• SEQ ID NO: 627 within SEQ ID NOS: 603 to 605,607, and 608;<br>
• SEQ ID NO: 640 within SEQ ID NO: 606;<br>
• SEQ ID NO: 628 within SEQ ID NOS: 603,604, and 608;<br>
• SEQ ID NO: 641 within SEQ ID NO: 605;<br>
• SEQ ID NO: 642 within SEQ ID NO: 606;<br>
• SEQ ID NO: 643 within SEQ ID NO: 607;<br>
t SEQ ID NO: 630 within SEQ ID NO: 603;<br>
• SEQ ID NO: 644 within SEQ ID NOS: 604 to 608;<br>
• SEQ ID NO: 632 within SEQ ID NOS: 603,604, 606, 607, and 608;<br>
• SEQ ID NO: 645 within SEQ ID NO: 605;<br>
• SEQ ID NO: 634 within SEQ ID NOS: 603, 604, and 607;<br>
• SEQ ID NO: 646 within SEQ ID NOS: 605, 606 and 608;<br>
• SEQ ID NO: 636 within SEQ ID NOS: 603,604, 606, and 608;<br>
• SEQ ID NO: 614 within SEQ ID NO: 605; and<br>
• SEQ ID NO: 620 within SEQ ID NO: 607.<br>
The sequence alignments of Figures 2B and 2C suggest two more potential insertion sites at Qi67/Pi68<br>
and/or G183/S184 (using the numbering of SEQ ID NO: 599 in Figure 2A). These positions correspond to gaps<br>
in the IgG sequences where there are 2 and 3 residue insertions found in the aligned IgA and IgM sequences.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Definition of Terms<br>
The terms used throughout this specification are defined as follows, unless otherwise limited in<br>
specific instances.<br>
When used in connection with an amino acid sequence, the term "comprising" means that a compound<br>
may include additional amino acids on either or both of the N- or C- termini of the given sequence.<br>
"Antibody" or "antibody peptide(s)" refer to an intact antibody, or a binding fragment thereof that<br>
competes with the intact antibody for specific binding and includes chimeric, humanized, fully human, and<br>
bispecific antibodies. In certain embodiments, binding fragments are produced by recombinant DNA<br>
techniques. In additional embodiments, binding fragments are produced by enzymatic or chemical cleavage<br>
of intact antibodies. Binding fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, Fv, and single-chain<br>
antibodies.<br>
The term "native Fc" refers to a molecule or sequence comprising the sequence of a non-antigenbinding<br>
fragment resulting from digestion of whole antibody, whether in monomeric or multimeric form, into<br>
which a peptide sequence may be added by insertion into or replacement of a loop region. The original<br>
immunoglobulin source of the native Fc is preferably of human origin and may be any of the<br>
immunoglobulins, although IgGl and IgG2 are preferred Native Fc's are made up of monomeric polypeptides<br>
that may be linked into dimeric or multimeric forms by covalent (i.e., disulfide bonds) and non-covalent<br>
association. The number of intermolecular disulfide bonds between monomeric subunits of native Fc<br>
molecules ranges from 1 to 4 depending on class (e.g., IgG, IgA, IgE) or subclass (e.g., IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgAl,<br>
IgGA2). One example of a native Fc is a disulfide-bonded dimer resulting from papain digestion of an IgG (see<br>
Ellison et al. (1982), Nucleic Acids Res. 10: 4071-9). The term "native Fc" as used herein is generic to the<br>
monomeric, dimeric, and multimeric forms.<br>
The term "Fc variant" refers to a molecule or sequence that is modified from a native Fc but still<br>
comprises a binding site for the salvage receptor, FcRn. International applications WO 97/34631 (published 25<br>
September 1997) and WO 96/32478 describe exemplary Fc variants, as well as interaction with the salvage<br>
receptor, and are hereby incorporated by reference. Thus, the term "Fc variant" comprises a molecule or<br>
sequence that is humanized from a non-human native Fc. Furthermore, a native Fc comprises sites that may be<br>
removed because they provide structural features or biological activity that are not required for the fusion<br>
molecules of the present invention. Thus, the term "Fc variant" comprises a molecule or sequence that lacks<br>
one or more native Fc sites or residues that affect or are involved in (1) disulfide bond formation, (2)<br>
incompatibility with a selected host cell (3) N-terminal heterogeneity upon expression in a selected host cell,<br>
(4) glycosylation, (5) interaction with complement, (6) binding to an Fc receptor other than a salvage receptor,<br>
or (7) antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Fc variants are described in further detail hereinafter.<br>
The term "Fc domain" encompasses native Fc and Fc variant molecules and sequences as defined<br>
above. As with Fc variants and native Fc's, the term "Fc domain" includes molecules in monomeric or<br>
multimeric form, whether digested from whole antibody or produced by other means.<br>
The term "multimer" as applied to Fc domains or molecules comprising Fc domains refers to<br>
molecules having two or more polypeptide chains associated covalently, noncovalently, or by both covalent<br>
and non-covalent interactions. IgG molecules typically form dimers; IgM, pentamers; IgD, dimers; and IgA,<br>
monomers, dimers, trimers, or tetramers. Multimers may be formed by exploiting the sequence and resulting<br>
activity of the native Ig source of the Fc or by derivatizing (as defined below) such a native Fc.<br>
The term "dimer" as applied to Fc domains or molecules comprising Fc domains refers to molecules<br>
having two polypeptide chains associated covalently or non-covalently. Exemplary dimers within the scope of<br>
this invention are as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,660,843, Figure 2, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The terms "derivatizing" and "derivative" or "derivatized" comprise processes and resulting<br>
compounds respectively in which (1) the compound has a cyclic portion; for example, cross-linking between<br>
cysteinyl residues within the compound; (2) the compound is cross-linked or has a cross-linking site; for<br>
example, the compound has a cysteinyl residue and thus forms cross-linked dimers in culture or in vivo; (3)<br>
one or more peptidyl linkage is replaced by a non-peptidyl linkage; (4) the N-terminus is replaced by -NRR1,<br>
NRC(O)R1, -NRC(O)OR1, -NRS(O)2R1, -NHC(O)NHR, a succinimide group, or substituted or unsubstituted<br>
benzyloxycarbonyl-NH-, wherein R and R1 and the ring substituents are as defined hereinafter; (5) the Cterminus<br>
is replaced by -C(O)R2 or -NR3R4 wherein R2, R3 and R4 are as defined hereinafter; and (6)<br>
compounds in which individual amino acid moieties are modified through treatment with agents capable of<br>
reacting with selected side chains or terminal residues. Derivatives are further described hereinafter.<br>
The term "polypeptide" refers to molecules of greater than 40 amino acids', whether existing in nature<br>
or not, provided that such molecules are not membrane-bound. Exemplary polypeptides include IL-lra, leptin,<br>
soluble TNF receptors type 1 and type 2 (sTNF-Rl, sTNF-R2), KGF, EPO, TPO, G-CSF, darbepoietin, Fab<br>
fragments and the like.<br>
The term "peptide" refers to molecules of 2 to 40 amino acids, with molecules of 3 to 20 amino acids<br>
preferred and those of 6 to 15 amino acids most preferred. Exemplary peptides may be randomly generated by<br>
any of the methods cited above, carried in a peptide library (e.g., a phage display library), or derived by<br>
digestion of proteins.<br>
The term "randomized" as used to refer to peptide sequences refers to fully random sequences (e.g.,<br>
selected by phage display methods) and sequences in which one or more residues of a naturally occurring<br>
molecule is replaced by an amino acid residue not appearing in that position in the naturally occurring<br>
molecule. Exemplary methods for identifying peptide sequences include phage display, E. coli display,<br>
ribosome display, yeast-based screening, RNA-peptide screening, chemical screening, rational design, protein<br>
structural analysis, and the like.<br>
The term "pharmacologically active" means that a substance so described is determined to have<br>
activity that affects a medical parameter (e.g., blood pressure, blood cell count, cholesterol level) or disease<br>
state (e.g., cancer, autoimmune disorders). Thus, pharmacologically active peptides comprise agonistic or<br>
mimetic and antagonistic peptides as defined below.<br>
The terms "-mimetic peptide" and "-agonist peptide" refer to a peptide having biological activity<br>
comparable to a protein (e.g., EPO, TPO, G-CSF) that interacts with a protein of interest. These terms further<br>
include peptides that indirectly mimic the activity of a protein of interest, such as by potentiating the effects of<br>
the natural ligand of the protein of interest; see, for example, the G-CSF-mimetic peptides listed in Table 2<br>
hereof and in Table 7 of U.S. Pat. No. 6,660,843, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Thus, the term<br>
"EPO-mimetic peptide" comprises any peptides that can be identified or derived as described in Wrighton et<br>
al (1996), Science 273: 458-63, Naranda et al. (1999), Froc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96: 7569-74, or any other<br>
reference in Table 2 identified as having EPO-mimetic subject matter. Those of ordinary skill in the art<br>
appreciate that each of these references enables one to select different peptides than actually disclosed therein<br>
by following the disclosed procedures with different peptide libraries.<br>
The term "-antagonist peptide" or "inhibitor peptide" refers to a peptide that blocks or in some way<br>
interferes with the biological activity of the associated protein of interest, or has biological activity comparable<br>
to a known antagonist or inhibitor of the associated protein of interest. Thus, the term "TNF-antagonist<br>
peptide" comprises peptides that can be identified or derived as described in Takasaki et al. (1997), Nature<br>
Biotech. 15: 1266-70 or any of the references in Table 2 identified as having TNF-antagonistic subject matter.<br>
Those of ordinary skill in the art appreciate that each of these references enables one to select different<br>
peptides than actually disclosed therein by following the disclosed procedures with different peptide libraries.<br>

Table 2 identified as having TPO-mimetic subject matter, as well as WO 00/24770, published May 4, 2000,<br>
which is hereby incorporated by reference. Those of ordinary skill in the art appreciate that each of these<br>
references enables one to select different peptides than actually disclosed therein by following the disclosed<br>
procedures with different peptide libraries.<br>
The term "ang-2-binding peptide" comprises peptides that can be identified or derived as described in<br>
U.S. Pat. App. No. 2003/0229023, published Dec. 11, 2003; WO 03/057134, published 7/17/03; U.S.<br>
2003/0236193, published Dec. 25, 2003; and any other reference in Table 2 identified as having subject matter<br>
related to ang-2. Those of ordinary skill in the art appreciate that each of these references enables one to select<br>
different peptides than actually disclosed therein by following the disclosed procedures with different peptide<br>
libraries.<br>
The term "NGF-binding peptide" comprises peptides that can be identified or derived as described in<br>
WO 04/026329, published April 1, 2004 and any other reference in Table 2 identified as having subject matter<br>
related to NGF. Those of ordinary skill in the art appreciate that each of these references enables one to select<br>
different peptides than actually disclosed therein by following the disclosed procedures with different peptide<br>
libraries.<br>
The term "myostatin-binding peptide" comprises peptides that can be identified or derived as<br>
described in U.S. Ser. No. 10/742,379, filed December 19, 2003 and any other reference in Table 2 identified as<br>
having subject matter related to myostatin. Those of ordinary skill in the art appreciate that each of these<br>
references enables one to select different peptides than actually disclosed therein by following the disclosed<br>
procedures with different peptide libraries.<br>
Additionally, physiologically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention are also encompassed<br>
herein. By "physiologically acceptable salts" is meant any salts that are known or later discovered to be<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable. Some specific examples are: acetate; trifluoroacetate; hydrohalides, such as<br>
hydrochloride and hydrobromide; sulfate; citrate; tartrate; glycolate; and oxalate.<br>
Structure of compounds<br>
In General<br>
In the compositions of matter prepared in accordance with this invention, the peptide may be attached<br>
to the vehicle through the peptide's N-terminus or C-terminus. Thus, the vehicle-peptide molecules of this<br>
invention may be described by the following formula I:<br>
wherein:<br>
F1 is an Fc domain modified so that it comprises at least one X3 in a loop region;<br>
Xi and X2 are each independently selected from -(Li)c-P1, -(Li)c-P1-(L2)d -P2, -(L^c-PML^-<br>
X3 is independently selected from -(L5)C-P5, -(L5)c-P5-(L6)d -P*, -(L5)c-P5-(L6)d-p6-(l7)e-P7, and -(L5)C-P5-<br>
(L6)d-P6-(I7)e -P7-(L«)f-P8;<br>
P1, P2/ P3, and P4 are each independently sequences of pharmacologically active polypeptides or<br>
pharmacologically active peptides;<br>
P5, P6, P7, and P8 are each independently sequences of pharmacologically active peptides;<br>
L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, L6, U, and L8 are each independently linkers; and<br>
a, b, c, d, e, and f are each independently 0 or 1.<br>
In preferred embodiments, a and b are both zero—i.e., neither X1 nor X2 groups appear at the Nterminus<br>
or C-terminus of the Fc domain.<br>
Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that more than one X3 substituent may be present in<br>
the Fc domain, and that the multiple X3 substituents may be different; for example, comprising different P5<br>
peptides, different linkers attached to the same peptide sequence, and so on. Likewise, X1 and X2 may be the<br>
same or different, and the integers c through f may be different for X1, X2, and X3.<br>
Thus, compound I comprises compounds of the formulae<br>
and multimers thereof wherein F1 is attached at the C-terminus of X1;<br>
and multimers thereof wherein F1 is attached at the N-terminus of X2;<br>
and multimers thereof wherein F1 is attached at the N-terminus of -(UJc-P1; and<br>
and multimers thereof wherein F1 is attached at the N-terminus of -L1-P1-L2-P2.<br>
Feptides<br>
Any number of peptides may be used in conjunction with the present invention. Preferred peptides<br>
bind to angiopoietin-2 (ang-2), myostatin, nerve growth factor (NGF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), B cell<br>
activating factor (BAFF, also referred to as TALL-1) or mimic the activity of EPO, TPO, or G-CSF. Targeting<br>
peptides are also of interest, including tumor-homing peptides, membrane-transporting peptides, and the like.<br>
All of these classes of peptides may be discovered by methods described in the references cited in this<br>
specification and other references.<br>
Phage display, in particular, is useful in generating peptides for use in the present invention. It has<br>
been stated that affinity selection from libraries of random peptides can be used to identify peptide ligands for<br>
any site of any gene product. Dedman et al. (1993), J. Biol. Chem. 268: 23025-30. Phage display is particularly<br>
well suited for identifying peptides that bind to such proteins of interest as cell surface receptors or any<br>
proteins having linear epitopes. Wilson et al. (1998), Can. J. Microbiol. 44: 313-29; Kay et al. (1998), Drug Disc.<br>
Today 3: 370-8. Such proteins are extensively reviewed in Herz et al. (1997), J. Receptor &amp; Signal Transduction<br>
Res. 17(5): 671-776, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Such proteins of interest are preferred for use in<br>
this invention.<br>
A particularly preferred group of peptides are those that bind to cytokine receptors. Cytokines have recently been classified according to their receptor code. See Inglot (1997), Archivum Immunologiae et<br>
Therapiae Experimentalis 45: 353-7, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Among these receptors, most<br>
preferred are the CKRs (family I in Table 3). The receptor classification appears in Table 3.<br>
Table 3 — Cytokine Receptors Classified by Receptor Code<br>
 (Table Removed)<br>
 Other IFN type I subtypes remain unassigned. Hematopoietic cytokines, IL-10 ligands and interferons do not possess functional<br>
intrinsic protein kinases. The signaling molecules for the cytokines are JAK's, STATs and related non-receptor molecules. IL-14,<br>
IL-16 and IL-18 have been cloned but according to the receptor code they remain unassigned.<br>
3 TNF receptors use multiple, distinct intracellular molecules for signal transduction including "death domain" of FAS R and 55<br>
kDa TNF-aR that participates in their cytotoxic effects. NGF/TNF R can bind both NGF and related factors as well as TNF<br>
ligands. Chemokine receptors are seven transmembrane (7TM, serpentine) domain receptors. They are G protein-coupled.<br>
4 The Duffy blood group antigen (DARC) is an erythrocyte receptor that can bind several different chemokines! IL-1 R belongs to<br>
the immunoglobulin superfamily but their signal transduction events characteristics remain unclear.<br>
5 The neurotrophic cytokines can associate with NGF/TNF receptors also.<br>
Particular proteins of interest as targets for peptide generation in the present invention include the<br>
following:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
splice variants of molecules preferentially expressed on tumor cells; e.g., CD44, CD30<br>
unglycosylated variants of mucin and Lewis Y surface glycoproteins :<br>
CD19, CD20, CD33, CD45<br>
prostate specific membrane antigen and prostate specific cell antigen<br>
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), both secreted and membrane-bound (e.g., MMP-9)<br>
Cathepsins<br>

are hereby incorporated by reference. Additional preferred peptides appear in U.S. 2003/0229023, published<br>

incorporated by reference. Such peptides may be prepared by methods disclosed in the art.<br>
Particularly preferred peptides appear in the tables below. Single letter amino acid abbreviations are<br>
used. Any of these peptides may be linked in tandem (i.e., sequentially), with or without linkers. Any peptide<br>
containing a cysteinyl residue may be cross-linked with another Cys-containing peptide or protein. Any<br>
6 STKS may encompass many other TGF-p-related factors that remain unassigned. The protein kinases are intrinsic part of the<br>
intracellular domain of receptor kinase family (RKF). The enzymes participate in the signals transmission via the receptors.<br>
peptide having more than one Cys residue may form an intrapeptide disulfide bond, as well. Any of these<br>
peptides may be derivatized as described herein. All peptides are linked through peptide bonds unless<br>
otherwise noted.<br>
Table 4—EPO-mimetic peptide sequences<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
This invention requires the presence of at least one Fc domain modified to comprise a peptide<br>
sequence.<br>
As noted above, both native Fc's and Fc variants are suitable Fc domains for use within the scope of<br>
this invention. A native Fc may be extensively modified to form an Fc variant in accordance with this<br>
invention, provided binding to the salvage receptor is maintained; see, for example WO 97/34631 and WO<br>
96/32478. In such Fc variants, one may remove one or more sites of a native Fc that provide structural features<br>
or functional activity not required by the fusion molecules of this invention. One may remove these sites by,<br>
for example, substituting or deleting residues, inserting residues into the site, or truncating portions<br>
combining the site. The inserted or substituted residues may also be altered amino acids, such as<br>
peptidomimetics or D-amino acids. Fc variants may be desirable for a number of reasons, several of which are<br>
described below. Exemplary Fc variants include molecules and sequences in which:<br>
1. Sites involved in disulfide bond formation are removed. Such removal may avoid reaction with other<br>
cysteine-containing proteins present in the host cell used to produce the molecules of the invention. For<br>
this purpose, the cysteine-containing segment at the N-terminus may be truncated or cysteine residues<br>
may be deleted or substituted with other amino acids (e.g., alanyl, seryl). In particular, one may truncate<br>
the N-terminal 20-amino acid segment of SEQ ID NO: 599 or delete or substitute the cysteine residues at<br>
positions 7 and 10 of SEQ ID NO: 599 Even when cysteine residues are removed, the single chain Fc<br>
domains can still form a dimeric Fc domain that is held together non-covalently.<br>
2. A native Fc is modified to make it more compatible with a selected host cell. For example, one may remove<br>
the PA sequence near the N-terminus of a typical native Fc, which may be recognized by a digestive<br>
enzyme in E. coli such as proline iminopeptidase. One may also add an N-terminal methionine residue,<br>
especially when the molecule is expressed recombinantly in a bacterial cell such as E. coli. The Fc domain<br>
of SEQ ID NO: 599 (Figure 2A) is one such Fc variant.<br>
3. A portion of the N-terminus of a native Fc is removed to prevent N-terminal heterogeneity when<br>
expressed in a selected host cell. For this purpose, one may delete any of the first 20 amino acid residues at<br>
the N-terminus, particularly those at positions 1,2, 3,4 and 5.<br>
4. One or more glycosylation sites are removed. Residues that are typically glycosylated (e.g., asparagine)<br>
may confer cytolytic response. Such residues may be deleted or substituted with unglycosylated residues<br>
(e.g., alanine).<br>
5. Sites involved in interaction with complement, such as the Clq binding site, are removed. For example,<br>
one may delete or substitute the EKK sequence of human IgGl. Complement recruitment may not be<br>
advantageous for the molecules of this invention and so may be avoided with such an Fc variant.<br>
6. Sites are removed that affect binding to Fc receptors other than a salvage receptor. A native Fc may have<br>
sites for interaction with certain white blood cells that are not required for the fusion molecules of the<br>
present invention and so may be removed.<br>
7. The ADCC site is removed. ADCC sites are known in the art; see, for example, Molec. Immunol. 29 (5):<br>
633-9 (1992) with regard to ADCC sites in IgGl. These sites, as well, are not required for the fusion<br>
molecules of the present invention and so may be removed.<br>
8. When the native Fc is derived from a non-human antibody, the native Fc may be humanized. Typically, to<br>
humanize a native Fc, one will substitute selected residues in the non-human native Fc with residues that<br>
are normally found in human native Fc. Techniques for antibody humanization are well known in the art.<br>
Preferred Fc variants include the following. In SEQ ID NO: 599 (Figure 2A) the leucine at position 15<br>
may be substituted with glutamate; the glutamate at position 99, with alanine; and the lysines at positions 101<br>
and 103, with alanines. In addition, one or more tyrosine residues can be replaced by phenyalanine residues.<br>
Additional vehicles The invention further embraces molecules covalently modified to include one or more water soluble<br>
polymer attachments, such as polyethylene glycol, polyoxyethylene glycol, or polypropylene glycol, as<br>
described U.S. Patent Nos.: 4,640,835; 4,496,689; 4,301,144; 4,670,417; 4,791,192; and 4,179,337. Still other<br>
useful polymers known in the art include monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol, dextran, cellulose, or other<br>
carbohydrate based polymers, poly~(N-vinyl pyrrolidone)-polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol<br>
homopolymers, a polypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide co-polymer, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., glycerol)<br>
and polyvinyl alcohol, as well as mixtures of these polymers. Particularly preferred are peptibodies covalently<br>
modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) subunits. Water-soluble polymers may be bonded at specific<br>
positions, for example at the amino terminus of the peptibodies, or randomly attached to one or more side<br>
chains of the polypeptide. The use of PEG for improving the therapeutic capacity for specific binding agents,<br>
e.g. peptibodies, and for humanized antibodies in particular, is described in US Patent No. 6, 133, 426 to<br>
Gonzales et al., issued October 17,2000.<br>
Various means for attaching chemical moieties useful as vehicles are currently available, see, e.g.,<br>
Patent Cooperation Treaty ("PCT") International Publication No. WO 96/11953, entitled "N-Terminally<br>
Chemically Modified Protein Compositions and Methods," herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
This PCT publication discloses, among other things, the selective attachment of water soluble polymers to the<br>
N-terminus of proteins.<br>
A preferred polymer vehicle is polyethylene glycol (PEG). The PEG group may be of any convenient<br>
molecular weight and may be linear or branched. The average molecular weight of the PEG will preferably<br>
range from about 2 kiloDalton ("kD") to about 100 kD, more preferably from about 5 kDa to about 50 kDa,<br>
most preferably from about 5 kD to about 20 kD. The PEG groups will generally be attached to the<br>
compounds of the invention via acylation or reductive alkylation through a reactive group on the PEG moiety<br>
(e.g., an aldehyde, maleimide, amino, thiol, or ester group) to a reactive group on the inventive compound<br>
(e.g., an aldehyde, amino, thiol or ester group).<br>
A useful strategy for the PEGylation of synthetic peptides consists of combining, through forming a<br>
conjugate linkage in solution, a peptide and a PEG moiety, each bearing a special functionality that is mutually<br>
reactive toward the other. The peptides can be easily prepared with conventional solid phase synthesis (see, for example, Figures 5 and 6 and the accompanying text herein). The peptides are "preactivated" with an<br>
appropriate functional group at a specific site. The precursors are purified and fully characterized prior to<br>
reacting with the PEG moiety. Ligation of the peptide with PEG usually takes place in aqueous phase and can<br>
be easily monitored by reverse phase analytical HPLC. The PEGylated peptides can be easily purified by<br>
preparative HPLC and characterized by analytical HPLC, amino acid analysis and laser desorption mass<br>
spectrometry.<br>
Polysaccharide polymers are another type of water soluble polymer which may be used for protein<br>
modification. Dextrans are polysaccharide polymers comprised of individual subunits of glucose<br>
predominantly linked by al-6 linkages. The dextran itself is available in many molecular weight ranges, and is<br>
readily available in molecular weights from about 1 kD to about 70 kD. Dextran is a suitable water soluble<br>
polymer for use in the present invention as a vehicle by itself or in combination with another vehicle (e.g., Fc).<br>
See tor example, WO 96/11953 and WO 96/05309. The use of dextran conjugated to therapeutic or diagnostic<br>
immunoglobulins has been reported; see, for example, European Patent Publication No. 0 315 456, which is<br>
hereby incorporated by reference. Dextran of about 1 kD to about 20 kD is preferred when dextran is used as a<br>
vehicle in accordance with the present invention.<br>
An additional vehicle may also be a protein, polypeptide, peptide, antibody, antibody fragment, or<br>
small molecule (e.g., a peptidomimetic compound) capable of binding to a salvage receptor. For example, one<br>
could use as a vehicle a polypeptide as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,739,277, issued April 14,1998 to Presta et al.<br>
Peptides could also be selected by phage display for binding to the FcRn salvage receptor. Such salvage<br>
receptor-binding compounds are also included within the meaning of "vehicle" in this invention. Such<br>
vehicles should be selected for increased half-life (e.g., by avoiding sequences recognized by proteases) and<br>
decreased immunogenicity (e.g., by favoring non-immunogenic sequences, as discovered in antibody<br>
hurnanization).<br>
Linkers<br>
Any "linker" group is optional. When present, its chemical structure is not critical, since it serves<br>
primarily as a spacer. The linker is preferably made up of amino acids linked together by peptide bonds.<br>
Thus, in preferred embodiments, the linker is made up of from 1 to 20 amino acids linked by peptide bonds,<br>
wherein the amino acids are selected from the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. Some of these amino acids<br>
may be glycosylated, as is well understood by those in the art. In a more preferred embodiment, the 1 to 20<br>
amino acids are selected from glycine, alanine, proline, asparagine, glutamine, and lysine. Even more<br>
preferably, a linker is made up of a majority of amino acids that are sterically unhindered, such as glycine and<br>
alanine. Thus, preferred linkers are polyglycines (particularly (Gly)4, (Gly)s), poly(Gly-Ala), and polyalanines.<br>
Other specific examples of linkers are:<br>
(Gly)3Lys(Gly)4 (SEQ ID NO: 595);<br>
(Gly)3AsnGlySer(Gly)2 (SEQ ID NO: 596);<br>
(Gly)3Cys(Gly)4 (SEQ ID NO: 597); and<br>
GlyProAsnGlyGly (SEQ ID NO: 598).<br>
To explain the above nomenclature, for example, (Gly)3Lys(Gly)4 means Gly-Gly-Gly-Lys-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly.<br>
Combinations of Gly and Ala are also preferred. The linkers shown here are exemplary; linkers within the<br>
scope of this invention may be much longer and may include other residues.<br>
Non-peptide linkers are also possible. For example, alkyl linkers such as -NH-(CH2)S-C(O)-, wherein s<br>
= 2-20 could be used. These alkyl linkers may further be substituted by any non-sterically hindering group<br>
such as lower alkyl (e.g., Ci-Ce) lower acyl, halogen (e.g., Cl, Br), CN, NH2, phenyl, etc. An exemplary nonpeptide<br>
linker is a PEG linker,<br>
wherein n is such that the linker has a molecular weight of 100 to 5000 kD, preferably 100 to 500 kD. The<br>
peptide linkers may be altered to form derivatives in the same manner as described above.<br>
Derivatives<br>
The invention also provides "derivatives" that include molecules bearing modifications other than, or<br>
in addition to, insertions, deletions, or substitutions of amino acid residues. Preferably, the modifications are<br>
covalent in nature, and include for example, chemical bonding with polymers, lipids, other organic, and<br>
inorganic moieties. Derivatives of the invention may be prepared to increase circulating half-life of a<br>
molecule; to improve targeting capacity for the molecule to desired cells, tissues, or organs; to improve the<br>
solubility or absorption of a molecule; or to eliminate or attenuate any undesirable side-effect of a molecule.<br>
Exemplary derivatives include compounds in which:<br>
1. The compound or some portion thereof is cyclic. For example, the peptide portion may be modified to<br>
contain two or more Cys residues (e.g., in the linker), which could cyclize by disulfide bond formation.<br>
For citations to references on preparation of cyclized derivatives, see Table 2.<br>
2. The compound is cross-linked or is rendered capable of cross-linking between molecules. For example, the<br>
peptide portion may be modified to contain one Cys residue and thereby be able to form an intermolecular<br>
disulfide bond with a like molecule. The compound may also be cross-linked through its C-terminus, as in<br>
the molecule shown below.<br>
3. One or more peptidyl [-C(O)NR-] linkages (bonds) is replaced by a non-peptidyl linkage. Exemplary nonpeptidyl<br>
linkages are -CH2-carbamate [-CH2-OC(O)NR-], phosphonate , -CHb-sulfonamide [-CHa-<br>
S(O)2NR-], urea [-NHC(O)NH-], -CH2-secondary amine, and alkylated peptide [-C(O)NR6- wherein R6 is<br>
lower alkyl].<br>
4. The N-terminus is derivatized. Typically, the N-terminus may be acylated or modified to a substituted<br>
amine. Exemplary N-terminal derivative groups include -NRR1 (other than -NFfr), -NRQOJR1,<br>
-NRC(O)OR1, -NRS(O)2R1, -NHC(O)NHR!, succinimide, or benzyloxycarbonyl-NH- (CBZ-NH-), wherein R<br>
and R1 are each independently hydrogen or lower alkyl and wherein the phenyl ring may be substituted<br>
with 1 to 3 substituents selected from the group consisting of C1-C4 alkyl, C1-C4 alkoxy, chloro, and bromo.<br>
5. The free C-terminus is derivatized. Typically, the C-terminus is esterified or amidated. For example, one<br>
may use methods described in the art to add (NH-CH2-CH2-NH2)2 to compounds of this invention.<br>
Likewise, one may use methods described in the art to add -NH2 to compounds of this invention.<br>
Exemplary C-terminal derivative groups include, for example, -C(O)R2 wherein R2 is lower alkoxy or -<br>
NR3R4 wherein R3 and R4 are independently hydrogen or C1-C8 alkyl (preferably C1-C4alkyl).<br>
6. A disulfide bond is replaced with another, preferably more stable, cross-linking moiety (e.g., an alkylene).<br>
See, e.g., Bhatnagar et al. (1996), T. Med. Chem. 39: 3814-9; Alberts et al. (1993) Thirteenth Am. Pep. Symp..<br>
357-9.<br>
7. One or more individual amino acid residues is modified. Various derivatizing agents are known to react<br>
specifically with selected sidechains or terminal residues, as described in detail below.<br>
Lysinyl residues and amino terminal residues may be reacted with succinic or other carboxylic acid<br>
anhydrides, which reverse the charge of the lysinyl residues. Other suitable reagents for derivatizing alpha-aminocontaining<br>
residues include imidoesters such as methyl picolinimidate; pyridoxal phosphate; pyridoxal;<br>
chloroborohydride; trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid; O-methylisourea; 2,4 pentanedione; and transaminase-catalyzed<br>
reaction with glyoxylate.<br>
Arginyl residues may be modified by reaction with any one or combination of several conventional reagents,<br>
including phenylglyoxal, 2,3-butanedione, 1,2-cyclohexanedione, and ninhydrin. Derivatization of arginyl residues<br>
requires that the reaction be performed in alkaline conditions because of the high pKa of the guanidine functional<br>
group. Furthermore, these reagents may react with the groups of lysine as well as the arginine epsilon-amino group.<br>
Specific modification of tyrosyl residues has been studied extensively, with particular interest in introducing<br>
spectral labels into tyrosyl residues by reaction with aromatic diazonium compounds or tetranitromethane. Most<br>
commonly, N-acetylimidizole and tetranitromethane are used to form O-acetyl tyrosyl species and 3-nitro<br>
derivatives, respectively.<br>
Carboxyl sidechain groups (aspartyl or glutamyl) may be selectively modified by reaction with<br>
carbodiimides (R'-N=C=N-R') such as l-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinyl-(4-ethyl) carbodiimide or l-ethyl-3-(4-azonia-<br>
4,4-dimethylpentyl) carbodiimide. Furthermore, aspartyl and glutamyl residues may be converted to asparaginyl<br>
and glutaminyl residues by reaction with ammonium ions.<br>
Glutaminyl and asparaginyl residues may be deamidated to the corresponding glutamyl and aspartyl<br>
residues. Alternatively, these residues are deamidated under mildly acidic conditions. Either form of these residues<br>
falls within the scope of this invention.<br>
Cysteinyl residues can be replaced by amino acid residues or other moieties either to eliminate disulfide<br>
bonding or, conversely, to stabilize cross-linking. See, e.g., Bhatnagar et al. (1996), T. Med. Chem. 39: 3814-9.<br>
Derivatization with bifunctional agents is useful for cross-linking the peptides or their functional derivatives<br>
to a water-insoluble support matrix or to other macromolecular vehicles. Commonly used cross-linking agents<br>
include, e.g., l,l-bis(diazoacetyl)-2-phenylethane, glutaraldehyde, N-hydroxysuccinimide esters, for example, esters<br>
with 4-azidosalicylic acid, homobifunctional imidoesters, including disuccinimidyl esters such as 3,3'-<br>
dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate), and bifunctional maleimides such as bis-N-maleimido-l,8-octane. Derivatizing<br>
agents such as methyl-3-[(p-azidophenyl)dithio]propioimidate yield photoactivatable intermediates that are capable<br>
of forming crosslinks in the presence of light. Alternatively, reactive water-insoluble matrices such as cyanogen<br>
bromide-activated carbohydrates and the reactive substrates described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,969,287; 3,691,016;<br>
4,195,128; 4,247,642; 4,229,537; and 4,330,440 are employed for protein immobilization.<br>
Carbohydrate (oligosaccharide) groups may conveniently be attached to sites that are known to be<br>
glycosylation sites in proteins. Generally, O-linked oligosaccharides are attached to serine (Ser) or threonine<br>
Thx) residues while N-linked oligosaccharides are attached to asparagine (Asn) residues when they are part of<br>
the sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr, where X can be any amino acid except proline. X is preferably one of the 19<br>
naturally occurring amino acids other than proline. The structures of N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides<br>
and the sugar residues found in each type are different. One type of sugar that is commonly found on both is<br>
N-acetylneuraminic acid (referred to as sialic acid). Sialic acid is usually the terminal residue of both N-linked<br>
and O-linked oligosaccharides and, by virtue of its negative charge, may confer acidic properties to the<br>
glycosylated compound. Such site(s) may be incorporated in the linker of the compounds of this invention<br>
and are preferably glycosylated by a cell during recombinant production of the polypeptide compounds (e.g.,<br>
in mammalian cells such as CHO, BHK, COS). However, such sites may further be glycosylated by synthetic<br>
or semi-synthetic procedures known in the art.<br>
Other possible modifications include hydroxylation of proline and lysine, phosphorylation of hydroxyl<br>
groups of seryl or threonyl residues, oxidation of the sulfur atom in Cys, methylation of the alpha-amino<br>
groups of lysine, arginine, and histidine side chains. Creighton, Proteins: Structure and Molecule Properties<br>
(W. H. Freeman &amp; Co., San Francisco), pp. 79-86 (1983). , ..<br>
Such derivatized moieties preferably improve one or more characteristics including anti-angiogenic<br>
activity, solubility, absorption, biological half life, and the like of the compounds. Alternatively, derivatized<br>
moieties may result in compounds that have the same, or essentially the same, characteristics and/or<br>
properties of the compound that is not derivatized. The moieties may alternatively eliminate or attenuate any<br>
undesirable side effect of the compounds and the like.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may be changed at the DNA level, as well. The DNA sequence of<br>
any portion of the compound may be changed to codons more compatible with the chosen host cell. For E. coli,<br>
which is the preferred host cell, optimized codons are known in the art. Codons may be substituted to<br>
eliminate restriction sites or to include silent restriction sites, which may aid in processing of the DNA in the<br>
selected host cell. The vehicle, linker and peptide DNA sequences may be modified to include any of the<br>
foregoing sequence changes.<br>
Isotope- and toxin-conjugated derivatives. Another set of useful derivatives are the above-described<br>
molecules conjugated to toxins, tracers, or radioisotopes. Such conjugation is especially useful for molecules<br>
comprising peptide sequences that bind to tumor cells or pathogens. Such mole.cules may be used as<br>
therapeutic agents or as an aid to surgery (e.g., radioimmunoguided surgery or RIGS) or as diagnostic agents<br>
(e.g., radioimmunodiagnostics or RID).<br>
As therapeutic agents, these conjugated derivatives possess a number of advantages. They facilitate<br>
use of toxins and radioisotopes that would be toxic if administered without the specific binding provided by<br>
the peptide sequence. They also can reduce the side-effects that attend the use of radiation and chemotherapy<br>
by facilitating lower effective doses of the conjugation partner.<br>
Useful conjugation partners include:<br>
• radioisotopes, such as 90Yttrium, 131Iodine, 225Actinium, and 213Bismuth;<br>
• ricin A toxin, microbially derived toxins such as Pseudomonas endotoxin (e.g., PE38, PE40), and<br>
the like;<br>
• partner molecules in capture systems (see below);<br>
• biotin, streptavidin (useful as either partner molecules in capture systems or as tracers, especially<br>
for diagnostic use); and<br>
• cytotoxic agents (e.g., doxorubicin).<br>
One useful adaptation of these conjugated derivatives is use in a capture system. In such a system, the<br>
molecule of the present invention would comprise a benign capture molecule. This capture molecule would be<br>
able to specifically bind to a separate effector molecule comprising, for example, a toxin or radioisotope. Both<br>
the vehicle-conjugated molecule and the effector molecule would be administered to the patient. In such a<br>
system, the effector molecule would have a short half-life except when bound to the vehicle-conjugated<br>
capture molecule, thus minimizing any toxic side-effects. The vehicle-conjugated molecule would have a<br>
relatively long half-life but would be benign and non-toxic. The specific binding portions of both molecules<br>
can be part of a known specific binding pair (e.g., biotin, streptavidin) or can result from peptide generation<br>
methods such as those described herein.<br>
Such conjugated derivatives may be prepared by methods known in the art. In the case of protein<br>
effector molecules (e.g., Pseudomonas endotoxin), such molecules can be expressed as fusion proteins from<br>
correlative DNA constructs. Radioisotope conjugated derivatives may be prepared, for example, as described<br>
for the BEXA antibody (Coulter). Derivatives comprising cytotoxic agents or microbial toxins may be<br>
prepared, for example, as described for the BR96 antibody (Bristol-Myers Squibb). Molecules employed in<br>
capture systems may be prepared, for example, as described by the patents, patent applications, and<br>
publications from NeoRx. Molecules employed for RIGS and RID may be prepared, for example, by the<br>
patents, patent applications, and publications from NeoProbe.<br>
A process for preparing conjugation derivatives is also contemplated. Tumor cells, for example, exhibit<br>
epitopes not found on their normal counterparts. Such epitopes include, for example, different posttranslational<br>
modifications resulting from their rapid proliferation. Thus, one aspect of this invention is a<br>
process comprising:<br>
a) selecting at least one randomized peptide that specifically binds to a target epitope; and<br>
b) preparing a pharmacologic agent comprising (i) at least one vehicle (Fc domain preferred), (ii)<br>
at least one amino acid sequence of the selected peptide or peptides, and (iii) an effector<br>
molecule.<br>
The target epitope is preferably a tumor-specific epitope or an epitope specific to a pathogenic organism. The<br>
effector molecule may be any of the above-noted conjugation partners and is preferably a radioisotope.<br>
Variants<br>
Variants are also included within the scope of the present invention. Included within variants are<br>
insertional, deletional, and substitutional variants. It is understood that a particular molecule of the present<br>
invention may contain one, two or all three types of variants. Insertional and substitutional variants may<br>
contain natural amino acids, unconventional amino acids (as set forth below), or both.<br>
In one example, insertional variants are provided wherein one or more amino acid residues, either<br>
naturally occurring or unconventional amino acids, supplement a peptide or a peptibody amino acid<br>
sequence. Insertions may be located at either or both termini of the protein, or may be positioned within<br>
internal regions of the peptibody amino acid sequence. Insertional variants with additional residues at either<br>
or both termini can include, for example, fusion proteins and proteins including amino acid tags or labels.<br>
Insertional variants include peptides and peptibodies wherein one or more amino acid residues are added to<br>
the peptide or peptibody amino acid sequence, or fragment thereof.<br>
Variants of the invention also include mature peptides and peptibodies wherein leader or signal<br>
sequences are removed, and the resulting proteins having additional amino terminal residues, which amino<br>
acids may be natural or non-natural. Molecules of this invention (such as peptibodies) with an additional<br>
methionyl residue at amino acid position -1 (Met1-peptibody) are contemplated, as are specific binding agents<br>
with additional methionine and lysine residues at positions -2 and -1 (Met1-Lys-1-). Variants having additional<br>
Met, Met-Lys, Lys residues (or one or more basic residues, in general) are particularly useful for enhanced<br>
recombinant protein production in bacterial host cells.<br>
The invention also embraces variants having additional amino acid residues that arise from use of<br>
specific expression systems. For example, use of commercially available vectors that express a desired<br>
polypeptide as part of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion product provides the desired polypeptide having<br>
an additional glycine residue at amino acid position -1 after cleavage of the GST component from the desired<br>
polypeptide. Variants which result from expression in other vector systems are also contemplated, including<br>
those wherein poly-histidine tags are incorporated into the amino acid sequence, generally at the carboxy<br>
and/or amino terminus of the sequence.<br>
Insertional variants also include fusion proteins wherein the amino and/or carboxy termini of the<br>
peptide or peptibody is fused to another polypeptide, a fragment thereof or amino acids which are not<br>
generally recognized to be part of any specific protein sequence. Examples of such fusion proteins are<br>
immunogenic polypeptides, proteins with long circulating half lives, such as immunoglobulin constant<br>
regions, marker proteins, proteins or polypeptides that facilitate purification of the desired peptide or<br>
peptibody, and polypeptide sequences that promote formation of multimeric proteins (such as leucine zipper<br>
motifs that are useful in dimer formation/stability).<br>
This type of insertional variant generally has all or a substantial portion of the native molecule, linked<br>
at the N- or C-terminus, to all or a portion of a second polypeptide. For example, fusion proteins typically<br>
employ leader sequences from other species to permit the recombinant expression of a protein in a<br>
heterologous host. Another useful fusion protein includes the addition of an immunologically active domain,<br>
such as an antibody epitope, to facilitate purification of the fusion protein. Inclusion of a cleavage site at or<br>
near the fusion junction will facilitate removal of the extraneous polypeptide after purification. Other useful<br>
fusions include linking of functional domains, such as active sites from enzymes, glycosylation domains,<br>
cellular targeting signals or transmembrane regions.<br>
There are various commercially available fusion protein expression systems that may be used in the<br>
present invention. Particularly useful systems include but are not limited to the glutathione-S-transferase<br>
(GST) system (Pharmacia), the maltose binding protein system (NEB, Beverley, MA), the FLAG system (IBI,<br>
New Haven, CT), and the 6xHis system (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). These systems are capable of producing<br>
recrambinant peptides and/or peptibodies bearing only a small number of additional amino acids, which are<br>
unlikely to significantly affect the activity of the peptide or peptibody. For example, both the FLAG system<br>
and the 6xHis system add only short sequences, both of which are known to be poorly antigenic and which do<br>
not adversely affect folding of a polypeptide to its native conformation. Another N-terminal fusion that is<br>
contemplated to be useful is the fusion of a Met-Lys dipeptide at the N-terminal region of the protein or<br>
peptides. Such a fusion may produce beneficial increases in protein expression or activity.<br>
Other fusion systems produce polypeptide hybrids where it is desirable to excise the fusion partner<br>
from the desired peptide or peptibody. In one embodiment, the fusion partner is linked to the recombinant<br>
peptibody by a peptide sequence containing a specific recognition sequence for a protease. Examples of<br>
suitable sequences are those recognized by the Tobacco Etch Virus protease (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg,<br>
MD) or Factor Xa (New England Biolabs, Beverley, MA).<br>
The invention also provides fusion polypeptides which comprises all or part of a peptibody or peptide<br>
of the present invention, in combination with truncated tissue factor (tTF). tTF is a vascular targeting agent<br>
consisting of a truncated form of a human coagulation-inducing protein that acts as a tumor blood vessel<br>
clotting agent, as described U.S. Patent Nos.: 5,877,289; 6,004,555; 6,132,729; 6,132,730; 6,156,321; and European<br>
Patent No. EP 0988056. The fusion of tTF to the anti-Ang-2 peptibody or peptide, or fragments thereof<br>
facilitates the delivery of anti-Ang-2 to target cells.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides deletion variants wherein one or more amino acid residues in<br>
a peptide or peptibody are removed. Deletions can be effected at one or both termini of the peptibody, or from<br>
removal of one or more residues within the peptibody amino acid sequence. Deletion variants necessarily<br>
include all fragments of a peptide or peptibody.<br>
In still another aspect, the invention provides substitution variants of peptides and peptibodies of the<br>
invention. Substitution variants include those peptides and peptibodies wherein one or more amino acid<br>
residues are removed and replaced with one or more alternative amino acids, which amino acids may be<br>
naturally occurring or non-naturally occurring. Substitutional variants generate peptides or peptibodies that<br>
are "similar" to the original peptide or peptibody, in that the two molecules have a certain percentage of<br>
amino acids that are identical. Substitution variants include substitutions of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10,15,20, 25,<br>
30, amino acids within a peptide or peptibody, wherein the number of substitutions may be up to ten percent<br>
or more, of the amino acids of the peptide or peptibody. In one aspect, the substitutions are conservative in<br>
nature, however, the invention embraces substitutions that are also non-conservative and also includes<br>
unconventional amino acids.<br>
Identity and similarity of related peptides and peptibodies can be readily calculated by known<br>
methods. Such methods include, but are not limited to, those described in Computational Molecular Biology,<br>

- Preferred methods to determine the relatedness or percent identity of two peptides or polypeptides, or<br>
a polypeptide and a peptide, are designed to give the largest match between the sequences tested. Methods to<br>
determine identity are described in publicly available computer programs. Preferred computer program<br>
methods to determine identity between two sequences include, but are not limited to, the GCG program<br>
package, including GAP (Devereux et al., Nucl. Acid. Res., 12:387 (1984); Genetics Computer Group,<br>
University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, BLASTP, BLASTN, and FASTA (Altschul et al.. T. Mol. Biol.. 215:403-<br>
410 (1990)). The BLASTX program is publicly available from the National Center for Biotechnology<br>
Information (NCBI) and other sources (BLAST Manual, Altschul et al. NCB/NLM/NIH Bethesda, MD 20894;<br>
Altschul et al., supra (1990)). The well-known Smith Waterman algorithm may also be used to determine<br>
identity.<br>
Certain alignment schemes for aligning two amino acid sequences may result in the matching of only a<br>
short region of the two sequences, and this small aligned region may have very high sequence identity even<br>
though there is no significant relationship between the two full-length sequences. Accordingly, in certain<br>
embodiments, the selected alignment method (GAP program) will result in an alignment that spans at least ten<br>
percent of the full length of the target polypeptide being compared, i.e., at least 40 contiguous amino acids<br>
where sequences of at least 400 amino acids are being compared, 30 contiguous amino acids where sequences<br>
of at least 300 to about 400 amino acids are being compared, at least 20 contiguous amino acids where<br>
sequences of 200 to about 300 amino acids are being compared, and at least 10 contiguous amino acids where<br>
sequences of about 100 to 200 amino acids are being compared.<br>
For example, using the computer algorithm GAP (Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin,<br>
Madison, WI), two polypeptides for which the percent sequence identity is to be determined are aligned for<br>
optimal matching of their respective amino acids (the "matched span", as determined by the algorithm). In<br>
certain embodiments, a gap opening penalty (which is typically calculated as 3X the average diagonal; the<br>
"average diagonal" is the average of the diagonal of the comparison matrix being used; the "diagonal" is the<br>
score or number assigned to each perfect amino acid match by the particular comparison matrix) and a gap<br>
extension penalty (which is usually 1/10 times the gap opening penalty), as well as a comparison matrix such<br>
as PAM 250 or BLOSUM 62 are used in conjunction with the algorithm. In certain embodiments, a standard<br>
comparison matrix (see Dayhoff et al.. Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, 5(3)(1978) for the PAM 250<br>
comparison matrix; Henikoff et al., Froc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 89:10915-10919 (1992) for the BLOSUM 62<br>
comparison matrix) is also used by the algorithm.<br>
In certain embodiments, the parameters for a polypeptide sequence comparison include the following:<br>
Algorithm: Needleman et al.. T. Mol. Biol.. 48:443-453 (1970);<br>
Comparison matrix: BLOSUM 62 from Henikoff et al., supra (1992);<br>
Gap Penalty: 12<br>
Gap Length Penalty: 4<br>
Threshold of Similarity: 0<br>
The GAP program may be useful with the above parameters. In certain embodiments, the<br>
aforementioned parameters are the default parameters for polypeptide comparisons (along with no penalty for<br>
end gaps) using the GAP algorithm.<br>
In certain embodiments, the parameters for polynucleotide molecule sequence (as opposed to an<br>
amino acid sequence) comparisons include the following:<br>
Algorithm: Needleman et al., supra (1970);<br>
Comparison matrix: matches = +10, mismatch = 0<br>
Gap Penalty: 50<br>
Gap Length Penalty: 3<br>
The GAP program may also be useful with the above parameters. The aforementioned parameters are<br>
the default parameters for polynucleotide molecule comparisons.<br>
Other exemplary algorithms, gap opening penalties, gap extension penalties, comparison matrices,<br>
thresholds of similarity, etc. may be used, including those set forth in the Program Manual, Wisconsin<br>
Package, Version 9, September, 1997. The particular choices to be made will be apparent to those of skill in the<br>
art and will depend on the specific comparison to be made, such as DNA-to-DNA, protein-to-protein, proteinto-<br>
DNA; and additionally, whether the comparison is between given pairs of sequences (in which case GAP or<br>
BestFit are generally preferred) or between one sequence and a large database of sequences (in which case<br>
FASTA or BLASTA are preferred).<br>
As used herein, the twenty conventional amino acids and their abbreviations follow conventional<br>
usage. See Immunology—A Synthesis (2nd Edition, E. S. Golub and D. R. Gren, Eds., Sinauer Associates,<br>
Sunderland, Mass. (1991)), which is incorporated herein by reference for any purpose.<br>
The amino acids may have either L or D stereochemistry (except for Gly, which is neither L nor D) and<br>
the polypeptides and compositions of the present invention may comprise a combination of stereochemistries.<br>
However, the L stereochemistry is preferred. The invention also provides reverse molecules wherein the<br>
amino terminal to carboxy terminal sequence of the amino acids is reversed. For example, the reverse of a<br>
molecule having the normal sequence Xi-X2-Xs would be Xa-X2-Xi. The invention also provides retro-reverse<br>
molecules wherein, as above, the amino terminal to carboxy terminal sequence of amino acids is reversed and<br>
residues that are normally "L" enantiomers are altered to the "D" stereoisomer form.<br>
Stereoisomers (e.g., D-amino acids) of the twenty conventional amino acids, unnatural amino acids<br>
such as a-, a-disubstituted amino acids, N-alkyl amino acids, lactic acid, and other unconventional amino<br>
acids may also be suitable components for polypeptides of the present invention. Examples of unconventional<br>
amino acids include, without limitation: aminoadipic acid, beta-alanine, beta-aminopropionic acid,<br>
aminobutyric acid, piperidinic acid, aminocaprioic acid, aminoheptanoic acid, aminoisobutyric acid,<br>
aminopimelic acid, diaminobutyric acid, desmosine, diaminopimelic acid, diaminopropionic acid, Nethylglycine,<br>
N-ethylaspargine, hyroxylysine, allo-hydroxylysine, hydroxyproline, isodesmosine, alloisoleucine,<br>
N-methylglycine, sarcosine, N-methylisoleucine, N-methylvaline, norvaline, norleucine, orithine, 4-<br>
hycftfoxyproline, y-carboxyglutamate, E-N,N,N-trimethyllysine, e-N-acetyllysine, O-phosphoserine, Nacetylserine,<br>
N-formylmethionine, 3-methylhistidine, 5-hydroxylysine, ci-N-methylarginine, and other similar<br>
amino acids and amino acids (e.g., 4-hydroxyproline).<br>
Similarly, unless specified otherwise, the left-hand end of single-stranded polynucleotide sequences is<br>
the 5' end; the left-hand direction of double-stranded polynucleotide sequences is referred to as the 5'<br>
direction. The direction of 5' to 3' addition of nascent RNA transcripts is referred to as the transcription<br>
direction; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 5' to the 5'<br>
end of the RNA transcript are referred to as "upstream sequences"; sequence regions on the DNA strand<br>
having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 3' to the 3' end of the RNA transcript are referred to as<br>
"downstream sequences".<br>
It will be appreciated that amino acid residues can be divided into classes based on their common side<br>
chain properties:<br>
1. Neutral Hydrophobic: Alanine (Ala; A), Valine (Val; V), Leucine (Leu; L), Isoleucine (He; I), Proline<br>
(Pro; P), Tryptophan (Trp; W), Phenylalanine (Phe; F), and Methionine (Met, M).<br>
2. Neutral Polar: Glycine (Gly; G); Serine (Ser; S), Threonine (Thr; T), Tyrosine (Tyr; Y), Cysteine (Cys;<br>
C), Glutamine (Glu; Q), Asparagine (Asn; N), and Norleucine.<br>
3. Acidic: Aspartic Acid (Asp; D), Glutamic Acid (Glu; E);<br>
4) Basic: Lysine (Lys; K), Arginine (Arg; R), Histidine (His; H).<br>
See Lewin, B., Genes V, Oxford University Press (1994), p.11.<br>
Conservative amino acid substitutions may encompass unconventional amino acid residues, which are<br>
typically incorporated by chemical peptide synthesis rather than by synthesis in biological systems. These<br>
include, without limitation, peptidomimetics and other reversed or inverted forms of amino acid moieties.<br>
Non-conservative substitutions may involve the exchange of a member of one of these classes for a member<br>
from another class.<br>
In making such changes, according to certain embodiments, the hydropathic index of amino acids may<br>
be considered. Each amino acid has been assigned a hydropathic index on the basis of its hydrophobicity and<br>
charge characteristics. They are: isoleucine (+4.5); valine (+4.2); leucine (+3.8); phenylalanine (+2.8);<br>
cysteine/cystine (+2.5); methionine (+1.9); alanine (+1.8); glycine (-0.4); threonine (-0.7); serine (-0.8);<br>
tryptophan (-0.9); tyrosine (-1.3); proline (-1.6); histidine (-3.2); glutamate (-3.5); glutamine (-3.5); aspartate (-<br>
3.5); asparagine (-3.5); lysine (-3.9); and arginine (-4.5). ,<br>
The importance of the hydropathic amino acid index in conferring interactive biological function on a<br>
protein is understood in the art. Kyte et al., T. Mol. Biol., 157:105-131 (1982). It is known that certain amino<br>
acids may be substituted for other amino acids having a similar hydropathic index or score and still retain a<br>
similar biological activity. In making changes based upon the hydropathic index, in certain embodiments, the<br>
substitution of amino acids whose hydropathic indices are within ±2 is included. In certain embodiments,<br>
those which are within ±1 are included, and in certain embodiments, those within ±0.5 are included.<br>
It is also understood in the art that the substitution of like amino acids can be made effectively on the<br>
basis of hydrophilicity, particularly where the biologically functional peptibody or peptide thereby created is<br>
intended for use in immunological embodiments, as in the present case. In certain embodiments, the greatest<br>
local average hydrophilicity of a protein, as governed by the hydrophilicity of its adjacent amino acids,<br>
correlates with its immunogenicity and antigenicity, i.e., with a biological property of the protein.<br>
The following hydrophilicity values have been assigned to these amino acid residues: arginine (+3.0);<br>
lysine (+3.0); aspartate (+3.0 ± 1); glutamate (+3.0 ± 1); serine (+0.3); asparagine (+0.2); glutamine (+0.2);<br>
glycine (0); threonine (-0.4); proline (-0.5 ± 1); alanine (-0.5); histidine (-0.5); cysteine (-1.0); methionine (-1.3);<br>
valine (-1.5); leucine (-1.8); isoleucine (-1.8); tyrosine (-2.3); phenylalanine (-2.5) and tryptophan (-3.4). In<br>
making changes based upon similar hydrophilicity values, in certain embodiments, the substitution of amino<br>
acids whose hydrophilicity values are within ±2 is included, in certain embodiments, those which are within<br>
±1 are included, and in certain embodiments, those within ±0.5 are included. One may also identify epitopes<br>
from primary amino acid sequences on the basis of hydrophilicity. These regions are also referred to as<br>
"epitopic core regions."<br>
Exemplary amino acid substitutions are set forth in Table 10 below.<br>
Table 10<br>
Amino Acid Substitutions<br>
Original Residues<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
A skilled artisan will be able to determine suitable variants of the polypeptide as set forth herein using<br>
well-known techniques. In certain embodiments, one skilled in the art may identify suitable areas of the<br>
molecule that may be changed without destroying activity by targeting regions not believed to be important<br>
for activity. In certain embodiments, one can identify residues and portions of the molecules that are<br>
conserved among similar peptides or polypeptides. In certain embodiments, even areas that may be<br>
important for biological activity or for structure may be subject to conservative amino acid substitutions<br>
without destroying the biological activity or without adversely affecting the polypeptide structure.<br>
Additionally, one skilled in the art can review structure-function studies identifying residues in similar<br>
polypeptides that are important for activity or structure. In view of such a comparison, one can predict the<br>
importance of amino acid residues in a protein that correspond to amino acid residues which are important for<br>
activity or structure in similar proteins. One skilled in the art may opt for chemically similar amino acid<br>
substitutions for such predicted important amino acid residues.<br>
One skilled in the art can also analyze the three-dimensional structure and amino acid sequence in<br>
relation to that structure in similar polypeptides. In view of such information, one skilled in the art may<br>
predict the alignment of amino acid residues of an antibody with respect to its three dimensional structure. In<br>
certain embodiments, one skilled in the art may choose not to make radical changes to amino acid residues<br>
predicted to be on the surface of the protein, since such residues may be involved in important interactions<br>
with other molecules. Moreover, one skilled in the art may generate test variants containing a single amino<br>
acid substitution at each desired amino acid residue. The variants can then be screened using activity assays<br>
known to those skilled in the art. Such variants could be used to gather information about suitable variants.<br>
For example, if one discovered that a change to a particular amino acid residue resulted in destroyed,<br>
undesirably reduced, or unsuitable activity, variants with such a change may be avoided. In other words,<br>
based on information gathered from such routine experiments, one skilled in the art can readily determine the<br>
amino acids where further substitutions should be avoided either alone or in combination with other<br>
mutations.<br>
A number of scientific publications have been devoted to the prediction of secondary structure. See<br>
Moult J., Curr. Op. in Biotech., 7(4):422-427 (1996), Chou et al.. Biochemistry. 13(2):222-245 (1974); Chou et al..<br>
Biochemistry, 113(2):211-222 (1974); Chou et al.. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol., 47:45-148 (1978); Chou<br>
et al., Ann. Rev. Biochem., 47:251-276 and Chou et al., Biophys. T., 26:367-384 (1979). Moreover, computer<br>
programs are currently available to assist with predicting secondary structure. One method of predicting<br>
secondary structure is based upon homology modeling. For example, two polypeptides or proteins which<br>
have a sequence identity of greater than 30%, or similarity greater than 40% often have similar structural<br>
topologies. The recent growth of the protein structural database (PDB) has provided enhanced predictability<br>
of secondary structure, including the potential number of folds within a polypeptide's or_protein's structure.<br>
See Holm et al.. Nucl. Acid. Res., 27(l):244-247 (1999). It has been suggested (Brenner et al, Curr. Op. Struct.<br>
Biol, 7(3):369-376 (1997)) that there are a limited number of folds in a given polypeptide or protein and that<br>
once a critical number of structures have been resolved, structural prediction will become dramatically more<br>
accurate.<br>
Additional methods of predicting secondary structure include "threading" (Jones, D., Curr. Opin.<br>
Struct. Biol, 7(3):377-87 (1997); Sippl et al.. Structure. 4(1):15-19 (1996)), "profile analysis" (Bowie et al. Science,<br>
253:164-170 (1991); Gribskov et al. Meth. Enzym.. 183:146-159 (1990); Gribskov et al. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci..<br>
84(13):4355-4358 (1987)), and "evolutionary linkage" (See Holm, supra (1999), and Brenner, supra (1997)).<br>
In certain embodiments, peptibody variants include glycosylation variants wherein one or more<br>
glycosylation sites, such as a N-linked glycosylation site, has been added to the peptibody. An N-linked<br>
glycosylation site is characterized by the sequence: Asn-X-Ser or Asn-X-Thr, wherein the amino acid residue<br>
designated as X may be any amino acid residue except proline. The substitution or addition of amino acid<br>
residues to create this sequence provides a potential new site for the addition of an N-linked carbohydrate<br>
chain. Alternatively, substitutions which eliminate this sequence will remove an existing N-linked<br>
carbohydrate chain. Also provided is a rearrangement of N-linked carbohydrate chains wherein one or more<br>
N-linked glycosylation sites (typically those that are naturally occurring) are eliminated and one or more new<br>
N-linked sites are created.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may be changed at the DNA level, as well. The DNA sequence of<br>
any portion of the compound may be changed to codons more compatible with the chosen host cell. For E. coli,<br>
which is the preferred host cell, optimized codons are known in the art. Codons may be substituted to<br>
eliminate restriction sites or to include silent restriction sites, which may aid in processing of the DNA in the<br>
selected host cell. The vehicle, linker and peptide DNA sequences may be modified to include any of the<br>
foregoing sequence changes. Thus, all modifications, substitution, derivitizations, etc. discussed herein apply<br>
equally to all aspects of the present invention, including but not limited to peptides, peptide dimers and<br>
multimers, linkers, and vehicles.<br>
Affinity Maturation<br>
One embodiment of the present invention includes "affinity matured" peptides and peptibodies. This<br>
procedure contemplates increasing the affinity or the bio-activity of the peptides and peptibodies of the<br>
present invention using phage display or other selection technologies. Based on a consensus sequence (which<br>
is generated for a collection of related peptides), directed secondary phage display libraries can be generated<br>
in which the "core" amino acids (determined from the consensus sequence) are held constant or are biased in<br>
frequency of occurrence. Alternatively, an individual peptide sequence can be used to generate a biased,<br>
directed phage display library. Panning of such libraries can yield peptides (which can be converted to<br>
peptibodies) with enhanced binding to the target or with enhanced bio-activity.<br>
Non-Peptide Analogs/Protein Mimetics<br>
Furthermore, non-peptide analogs of peptides that provide a stabilized structure or lessened<br>
biodegradation, are also contemplated. Peptide mimetic analogs can be prepared based on a selected<br>
inhibitory peptide by replacement of one or more residues by nonpeptide moieties. Preferably, the nonpeptide<br>
moieties permit the peptide to retain its natural confirmation, or stabilize a preferred, e.g., bioactive,<br>
confirmation which retains the ability to recognize and bind Ang-2. In one aspect, the resulting<br>
analog/mimetic exhibits increased binding affinity for Ang-2. One example of .methods for preparation of<br>
nonpeptide mimetic analogs from peptides is described in Nachman et al.. Regul. Fept. 57:359-370 (1995). If<br>
desired, the peptides of the invention can be modified, for instance, by glycosylation, amidation,<br>
carboxylation, or phosphorylation, or by the creation of acid addition salts, amides, esters, in particular Cterminal<br>
esters, and N-acyl derivatives of the peptides of the invention. The peptibodies also can be modified<br>
to create peptide derivatives by forming covalent or noncovalent complexes with other moieties. Covalentlybound<br>
complexes can be prepared by linking the chemical moieties to functional groups on the side chains of<br>
amino acids comprising the peptibodies, or at the N- or C-terminus.<br>
In particular, it is anticipated that the peptides can be conjugated to a reporter group, including, but<br>
not limited to a radiolabel, a fluorescent label, an enzyme (e.g., that catalyzes a colorimetric or fluorometric<br>
reaction), a substrate, a solid matrix, or a carrier (e.g., biotin or avidin). The invention accordingly provides a<br>
molecule comprising a peptibody molecule, wherein the molecule preferably further comprises a reporter<br>
group selected from the group consisting of a radiolabel, a fluorescent label, an enzyme, a substrate, a solid<br>
matrix, and a carrier. Such labels are well known to those of skill in the art, e.g., biotin labels are particularly<br>
contemplated. The use of such labels is well known to those of skill in the art and is described in, e.g., U.S.<br>
Patent Nos.3,817,837; 3,850,752; 3,996,345; and 4,277,437. Other labels that will be useful include but are not<br>
limited to radioactive labels, fluorescent labels and chemiluminescent labels. U.S. Patents concerning use of<br>
such labels include, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,817,837; 3,850,752; 3,939,350; and 3,996,345. Any of the<br>
peptibodies of the present invention may comprise one, two, or more of any of these labels.<br>
Methods of Making<br>
The compounds of this invention largely may be made in transformed host cells using recombinant<br>
DNA techniques. To do so, a recombinant DNA molecule coding for the peptide is prepared. Methods of<br>
preparing such DNA molecules are well known in the art. For instance, sequences coding for the peptides<br>
could be excised from DNA using suitable restriction enzymes. Alternatively, the DNA molecule could be<br>
synthesized using chemical synthesis techniques, such as the phosphoramidate method. Also, a combination of<br>
these techniques could be used.<br>
The invention also includes a vector capable of expressing the peptides in an appropriate host. The<br>
vector comprises the DNA molecule that codes for the peptides operatively linked to appropriate expression<br>
control sequences. Methods of effecting this operative linking, either before or,, after the DNA molecule is<br>
inserted into the vector, are well known. Expression control sequences include promoters, activators,<br>
enhancers, operators, ribosomal binding sites, start signals, stop signals, cap signals, polyadenylation signals,<br>
and other signals involved with the control of transcription or translation.<br>
The resulting vector having the DNA molecule thereon is used to transform an appropriate host. This<br>
transformation may be performed using methods well known in the art.<br>
Any of a large number of available and well-known host cells may be used in the practice of this<br>
invention. The selection of a particular host is dependent upon a number of factors recognized by the art.<br>
These include, for example, compatibility with the chosen expression vector, toxicity of the peptides encoded<br>
by the DNA molecule, rate of transformation, ease of recovery of the peptides, expression characteristics, biosafety<br>
and costs. A balance of these factors must be struck with the understanding that not all hosts may be<br>
equally effective for the expression of a particular DNA sequence. Within these general guidelines, useful<br>
microbial hosts include bacteria (such as E. coli sp.), yeast (such as Saccharomyces sp.) and other fungi, insects,<br>
plants, mammalian (including human) cells in culture, or other hosts known in the art.<br>
Next, the transformed host is cultured and purified. Host cells may be cultured under conventional<br>
fermentation conditions so that the desired compounds are expressed. Such fermentation conditions are well<br>
known in the art. Finally, the peptides are purified from culture by methods well known in the art.<br>
The compounds may also be made by synthetic methods. For example, solid phase synthesis<br>
techniques may be used. Suitable techniques are well known in the art, and'include those described in<br>
Merrifield (1973), Chem. Folypeptides, pp. 335-61 (Katsoyannis and Panayotis eds.); Merrifield (1963), T. Am.<br>
Chem. Soc. 85: 2149; Davis et al. (1985), Biochem. Intl. 10: 394-414; Stewart and Young (1969), Solid Phase<br>
Peptide Synthesis; U.S. Pat. No. 3,941,763; Finn et al. (1976), The Proteins (3rd ed.) 2: 105-253; and Erickson et<br>
al. (1976), The Proteins (3rd ed.) 2: 257-527. Solid phase synthesis is the preferred technique of making<br>
individual peptides since it is the most cost-effective method of making small peptides.<br>
Compounds that contain derivatized peptides or which contain non-peptide groups may be<br>
synthesized by well-known organic chemistry techniques.<br>
Uses of the Compounds<br>
In general. The compounds of this invention have pharmacologic activity resulting from their ability to<br>
bind to proteins of interest as agonists, mimetics or antagonists of the native ligands of such proteins of<br>
interest. The utility of specific compounds is shown in Table 2. The activity of these compounds can be<br>
measured by assays known in the art. For the TPO-mimetic and EPO-mimetic compounds, in vivo assays are<br>
further described in the Examples section herein.<br>
In addition to therapeutic uses, the compounds of the present invention are useful in diagnosing<br>
diseases characterized by dysfunction of their associated protein of interest. In one embodiment, a method of<br>
detecting in a biological sample a protein of interest (e.g., a receptor) that is capable of being activated<br>
comprising the steps of: (a) contacting the sample with a compound of this invention; and (b) detecting<br>
activation of the protein of interest by the compound. The biological samples include tissue specimens, intact<br>
cells, or extracts thereof. The compounds of this invention may be used as part of a diagnostic kit to detect the<br>
presence of their associated proteins of interest in a biological sample. Such kits employ the compounds of the<br>
invention having an attached label to allow for detection. The compounds are useful for identifying normal or<br>
abnormal proteins of interest. For the EPO-mimetic compounds, for example, presence of abnormal protein of<br>
interest in a biological sample may be indicative of such disorders as Diamond Blackfan anemia, where it is<br>
believed that the EPO receptor is dysfunctional.<br>
Therapeutic uses of EPO-mimetic molecules<br>
The EPO-mimetic compounds of the invention are useful for treating disorders characterized by low<br>
red blood cell levels. Included in the invention are methods of modulating the endogenous activity of an EPO<br>
receptor in a mammal, preferably methods of increasing the activity of an EPO receptor. In general, any<br>
condition treatable by erythropoietin, such as anemia, may also be treated by the EPO-mimetic compounds of<br>
the invention. These compounds are administered by an amount and route of delivery that is appropriate for<br>
the nature and severity of the condition being treated and may be ascertained by one skilled in the art.<br>
Preferably, administration is by injection, either subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intravenous.<br>
Therapeutic uses of TFO-mimetic compounds<br>
For the TPO-mimetic compounds, one can utilize such standard assays as those described in<br>
WO95/26746 entitled "Compositions and Methods for Stimulating Megakaryocyte Growth and<br>
Differentiation". In vivo assays also appear in the Examples hereinafter.<br>
The conditions to be treated are generally those that involve an existing megakaryocyte/platelet<br>
deficiency or an expected megakaryocyte/platelet deficiency (e.g., because of planned surgery or platelet<br>
donation). Such conditions will usually be the result of a deficiency (temporary or permanent) of active Mpl<br>
ligand in vivo. The generic term for platelet deficiency is thrombocytopenia, and hence the methods and<br>
compositions of the present invention are generally available for treating thrombocytopenia in patients in need<br>
thereof.<br>
Thrombocytopenia (platelet deficiencies) may be present for various reasons, including chemotherapy<br>
and other therapy with a variety of drugs, radiation therapy, surgery, accidental blood loss, and other specific<br>
disease conditions. Exemplary specific disease conditions that involve thrombocytopenia and may be treated<br>
in accordance with this invention are: aplastic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenia, metastatic tumors which<br>
result in thrombocytopenia, systemic lupus erythematosus, splenomegaly, Fanconi's syndrome, vitamin B12<br>
deficiency, folic acid deficiency, May-Hegglin anomaly, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and paroxysmal nocturnal<br>
hemoglobinuria. Also, certain treatments for AIDS result in thrombocytopenia (e.g., AZT). Certain wound<br>
healing disorders might also benefit from an increase in platelet numbers.<br>
With regard to anticipated platelet deficiencies, e.g., due to future surgery, a compound of the present<br>
invention could be administered several days to several hours prior to the need for platelets. With regard to<br>
acute situations, e.g., accidental and massive blood loss, a compound of this invention could be administered<br>
along with blood or purified platelets.<br>
The TPO-mimetic compounds of this invention may also be useful in stimulating certain cell types other<br>
than megakaryocytes if such cells are found to express Mpl receptor. Conditions associated with such cells that<br>
express the Mpl receptor, which are responsive to stimulation by the Mpl ligand, are also within the scope of this<br>
invention.<br>
TPO-mimetic compounds of this invention may be used in any situation in which production of<br>
platelets or platelet precursor cells is desired, or in which stimulation of the c-Mpl receptor is desired. Thus, for<br>
example, the compounds of this invention may be used to treat any condition in a mammal wherein there is a need<br>
of platelets, megakaryocytes, and the like. Such conditions are described in detail in the following exemplary<br>
sources: WO95/26746; WO95/21919; WO95/18858; WO95/21920 and are incorporated herein.<br>
The TPO-mimetic compounds of this invention may also be useful in maintaining the viability or storage life<br>
of platelets and/or megakaryocytes and related cells. Accordingly, it could be useful to include an effective amount<br>
of one or more such compounds in a composition containing such cells.<br>
Therapeutic uses of Ang-2 binding molecules<br>
Agents that modulate Ang-2 binding activity, or other cellular activity, may be used in combination<br>
with other therapeutic agents to enhance their therapeutic effects or decrease potential side effects.<br>
In one aspect, the present invention provides reagents and methods useful for treating diseases and<br>
conditions characterized by undesirable or aberrant levels of Ang-2 activity in a cell. These diseases include<br>
cancers, and other hyperproliferative conditions, such as hyperplasia, psoriasis, contact dermatitis,<br>
immunological disorders, and infertility.<br>
The present invention also provides methods of treating cancer in an animal, including humans,<br>
comprising administering to the animal an effective amount of a specific binding agent, such as a peptibody,<br>
that inhibits or decreases Ang-2 activity. The invention is further directed to methods of inhibiting cancer cell<br>
growth, including processes of cellular proliferation, invasiveness, and metastasis in biological systems.<br>
Methods include use of a compound of the invention as an inhibitor of cancer cell growth. Preferably, the<br>
methods are employed to inhibit or reduce cancer cell growth, invasiveness, metastasis, or tumor incidence in<br>
living animals, such as mammals. Methods of the invention are also readily adaptable for use in assay<br>
systems, e.g., assaying cancer cell growth and properties thereof, as well as identifying compounds that affect<br>
cancer cell growth.<br>
The cancers treatable by methods of the present invention preferably occur in mammals. Mammals<br>
include, for example, humans and other primates, as well as pet or companion animals such as dogs and cats,<br>
laboratory animals such as rats, mice and rabbits, and farm animals such as horses, pigs, sheep, and cattle.<br>
Tumors or neoplasms include growths of tissue cells in which the multiplication of the cells is<br>
uncontrolled and progressive. Some such growths are benign, but others are termed malignant and may lead<br>
to death of the organism. Malignant neoplasms or cancers are distinguished from benign growths in that, in<br>
addition to exhibiting aggressive cellular proliferation, they may invade surrounding tissues and metastasize.<br>
Moreover, malignant neoplasms are characterized in that they show a greater loss of differentiation (greater<br>
dedifferentiation), and of their organization relative to one another and their surrounding tissues. This<br>
property is also called "anaplasia."<br>
Neoplasms treatable by the present invention also include solid tumors, i.e., carcinomas and sarcomas.<br>
Carcinomas include those malignant neoplasms derived from epithelial cells that infiltrate (invade) the<br>
surrounding tissues and give rise to metastases. Adenocarcinomas are carcinomas derived from glandular<br>
tissue, or which form recognizable glandular structures. Another broad category or cancers includes<br>
sarcomas, which are tumors whose cells are embedded in a fibrillar or homogeneous substance like embryonic<br>
connective tissue. The invention also enables treatment of cancers of the myeloid or lymphoid systems,<br>
including leukemias, lymphomas and other cancers that typically do not present as a tumor mass, but are<br>
distributed in the vascular or lymphoreticular systems.<br>
The ang-2 binding molecules of this invention are thus useful for the treatment of a wide variety of<br>
cancers, including solid tumors and leukemias. Types of cancer or tumor cells amenable to treatment<br>
according to the invention include, for example, ACTH-producing tumor; acute lymphocytic leukemia; acute<br>
nonlymphocytic leukemia; adenoma; cancer of the adrenal cortex; adenocarcinoma of the breast, prostate, and<br>
colon; ameloblastoma; apudoma; bladder cancer; brain cancer; branchioma; breast cancer; all forms of<br>

cystadenocarcinoma; cystadenoma; granulosa cell tumor; gynandroblastoma; hidradenoma; islet cell tumor;<br>
Leydig cell tumor; papilloma; Sertoli cell tumor; theca cell tumor; leiomyoma; leiomyosarcoma; myoblastoma;<br>

Therapeutic uses of NGF binding molecules<br>
The NGF binding molecules may be used in the prevention or treatment of NGF-related diseases and<br>
disorders. Such indications include but are not limited to pain (including, but not limited to, inflammatory pain and<br>
associated hyperalgesia and allodynia, neuropathic pain and associated hyperalgesia and allodynia, diabetic<br>
neuropathy pain, causalgia, sympathetically maintained pain, deafferentation syndromes, acute pain, tension<br>
headache, migraine, dental pain, pain from trauma, surgical pain, pain resulting frorn amputation or abscess,<br>
causalgia, demyelinating diseases, and trigeminal neuralgia). The peptides and modified peptides of the invention<br>
have therapeutic value for the prevention or treatment of other diseases linked to NGF as a causative agent,<br>
including, but not limited to, asthma, urge incontinence (i.e., hyperactive bladder), psoriasis, cancer (especially,<br>
pancreatic cancer and melanoma), chronic alcoholism, stroke, thalamic pain syndrome, diabetes, acquired immune<br>
deficiency syndrome ("AIDS"), toxins and chemotherapy, general headache, migraine, cluster headache, mixedvascular<br>
and non-vascular syndromes, general inflammation, arthritis, rheumatic diseases, lupus, osteoarthritis,<br>
inflammatory bowel disorders, inflammatory eye disorders, inflammatory or unstable bladder disorders, psoriasis,<br>

diseases, chronic inflammatory conditions, asthma, epithelial tissue damage or dysfunction, herpes simplex,<br>
disturbances of visceral motility at respiratory, genitourinary, gastrointestinal or vascular regions, wounds, burns,<br>
allergic skin reactions, pruritis, vitiligo, general gastrointestinal disorders, colitis, gastric ulceration, duodenal ulcers,<br>
vasomotor or allergic rhinitis, or bronchial disorders.<br>
Therapeutic uses of myostatin binding molecules<br>
The myostatin binding agents of the present invention bind to myostatin and block or inhibit<br>
myostatin signaling within targeted cells. The present invention provides methods and reagents for reducing<br>
the amount or activity of myostatin in an animal by administering an effective dosage of one or more<br>
myostatin binding agents to the animal. In one aspect, the present invention provides methods and reagents<br>
for treating myostatin-related disorders in an animal comprising administering an effective dosage of one or<br>
more binding agents to the animal. These myostatin-related disorders include but are not limited to various<br>
forms of muscle wasting, as well as metabolic disorders such as diabetes and related disorders, and bone<br>
degenerative diseases such as osteoporosis.<br>
As shown in the Example 8 of U.S. Ser. No. 10/742,379, exemplary peptibodies of the present invention<br>
dramatically increases lean muscle mass in the CD1 nu/nu mouse model. This in vivo activity correlates to<br>
the in vitro binding and inhibitory activity described below for the same peptibodies.<br>
Muscle wasting disorders include dystrophies such as Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, progressive<br>
muscular dystrophy, Becker's type muscular dystrophy, Dejerine-Landouzy muscular dystrophy, Erb's<br>
muscular dystrophy, and infantile neuroaxonal muscular dystrophy. For example, blocking myostatin<br>
through use of antibodies in vivo improved the dystrophic phenotype of the mdx mouse model of Duchenne<br>
muscular dystrophy (Bogdanovich et al. (2002), Nature 420: 28). Use of an exemplary peptibody increases<br>
lean muscle mass and increases the ratio of lean muscle to fat in mdx mouse models as described in Example 9<br>
below.<br>
Additional muscle wasting disorders arise from chronic disease such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,<br>
congestive obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, AIDS, renal failure, and rheumatoid arthritis. For example,<br>
cachexia or muscle wasting and loss of body weight was induced in athymic nude mice by a systemically<br>
administered myostatin (Zimmers et al., supra). In another example, serum and intramuscular concentrations<br>
of myostatin-immunoreactive protein was found to be increased in men exhibiting AIDS-related muscle<br>
wasting and was inversely related to fat-free mass (Gonzalez-Cadavid et al. (1998), PNAS USA 95: 14938-<br>
14943). Additional conditions resulting in muscle wasting may arise from inactivity due to disability such as<br>
confinement in a wheelchair, prolonged bedrest due to stroke, illness, bone fracture or trauma, and muscular<br>
atrophy in a microgravity environment (space flight). For example, plasma myostatin immunoreactive protein<br>
was found to increase after prolonged bedrest (Zachwieja et al. J Gravit Physiol. 6(2):11(1999). It was also<br>
found that the muscles of rats exposed to a microgravity environment during a space shuttle flight expressed<br>
an increased amount of myostatin compared with the muscles of rats which were not exposed (Lalani et al.<br>
(2000), T.Endocrin. 167 (3):417-28).<br>
In addition, age-related increases in fat to muscle ratios, and age-related muscular atrophy appear to<br>
be related to myostatin. For example, the average serum myostatin-immunoreactive protein increased with<br>
age in groups of young (19-35 yr old), middle-aged (36-75 yr old), and elderly (76-92 yr old) men and women,<br>
while the average muscle mass and fat-free mass declined with age in these groups (Yarasheski et al. J Nutr<br>
Aging 6(5):343-8 (2002)). It has also been shown that myostatin gene knockout in mice increased myogenesis<br>
and decreased adipogenesis (Lin et al. (2002), Biochem Biophys Res Commun 291(3):701-6, resulting in adults<br>
with increased muscle mass and decreased fat accumulation and leptin secretion. Exemplary molecules<br>
improve the lean muscle mass to fat ratio in aged mdx mice as shown below.<br>
In addition, myostatin has now been found to be expressed at low levels in heart muscle and<br>
expression is upregulated after cardiomyocytes after infarct (Sharma et al. (1999), T Cell Fhysiol. 180 (l):l-9).<br>
Therefore, reducing myostatin levels in the heart muscle may improve recovery of heart muscle after infarct.<br>
Myostatin also appears to influence metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes, noninsulindependent<br>
diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, and obesity. For example, lack of myostatin has been shown to<br>
improve the obese and diabetic phenotypes of two mouse models (Yen et al. supra). In addition, increasing<br>
muscle mass by reducing myostatin levels may improve bone strength and reduce osteoporosis and other<br>
degenerative bone diseases. It has been found, for example, that myostatin-deficient mice showed increased<br>
mineral content and density of the mouse humerus and increased mineral content of both trabecular and<br>
cortical bone at the regions where the muscles attach, as well as increased muscle mass (Hamrick et al. (2002),<br>
Calcif Tissue Int 71(1): 63-8). In the present invention, an exemplary peptibody increases the lean muscle mass<br>
to fat ratio in mdx mouse models as shown below.<br>
The present invention also provides methods and reagents for increasing muscle mass in food animals<br>
by administering an effective dosage of the myostatin binding agent to the animal. Since the mature Cterminal<br>
myostatin polypeptide is identical in all species tested, myostatin binding agents would be expected<br>
to be effective for increasing muscle mass and reducing fat in any agriculturally important species including<br>
cattle, chicken, turkeys, and pigs.<br>
The myostatin-binding molecules of the present invention may be used alone or in combination with<br>
other therapeutic agents to enhance their therapeutic effects or decrease potential side effects. The molecules<br>
of the present invention possess one or more desirable but unexpected combination of properties to improve<br>
the therapeutic value of the agents. These properties include increased activity, increased solubility, reduced<br>
degradation, increased half-life, reduced toxicity, and reduced immunogenicity. Thus the molecules of the<br>
present invention are useful for extended treatment regimes. In addition, the properties of hydrophilicity and<br>
hydrophobicity of the compounds of the invention are well balanced, thereby enhancing their utility for both<br>
in vitro and especially in vivo uses. Specifically, compounds of the invention have an appropriate degree of<br>
solubility in aqueous media that permits absorption and bioavailability in the body, while also having a<br>
degree of solubility in lipids that permits the compounds to traverse the cell membrane to a putative site of<br>
action, such as a particular muscle mass.<br>
The myostatin-binding molecules of the present invention are useful for treating a "subject" or any<br>
animal, including humans, when administered in an effective dosages in a suitable composition.<br>
In addition, the mystatin-binding molecules of the present invention are useful for detecting and<br>
quantitating myostatin in a number of assays. These assays are described in detail in U.S. Ser. No. 10/742,379.<br>
In general, the myostatin-binding molecules of the present invention are useful as capture agents to<br>
bind and immobilize myostatin in a variety of assays, similar to those described, for example, in Asai, ed.,<br>
Methods in Cell Biology, 37, Antibodies in Cell Biology, Academic Press, Inc., New York (1993). The<br>
myostatin-binding molecule may be labeled in some manner or may react with a third molecule such as an<br>
anti-binding molecule antibody which is labeled to enable myostatin to be detected and quantitated. For<br>
example, a myostatin-binding molecule or a third molecule can be modified with a detectable moiety, such as<br>
biotin, which can then be bound by a fourth molecule, such as enzyme-labeled streptavidin, or other proteins.<br>
(Akerstrom (1985), T Immunol 135:2589: Chaubert (1997), Mod Fathol 10:585).<br>
Throughout any particular assay, incubation and/or washing steps may be required after each<br>
combination of reagents. Incubation steps can vary from about 5 seconds to several hours, preferably from<br>
about 5 minutes to about 24 hours. However, the incubation time will depend upon the assay format, volume<br>
of solution, concentrations, and the like. Usually, the assays will be carried out at ambient temperature,<br>
although they can be conducted over a range of temperatures.<br>
Therapeutic uses of BAFF-binding molecules. BAFF-binding molecules of this invention may be<br>
particularly useful in treatment of B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases. In particular, they may be useful in<br>
treating, preventing, ameliorating, diagnosing or prognosing lupus, including systemic lupus erythematosus<br>
(SLE), and lupus-associated diseases and conditions. Other preferred indications include B-cell mediated<br>
cancers, including B-cell lymphoma.<br>
The compounds of this invention can also be used to treat inflammatory conditions of the joints.<br>
Inflammatory conditions of a joint are chronic joint diseases that afflict and disable, to varying degrees,<br>
millions of people worldwide. Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease of articular joints in which the cartilage and<br>
bone are slowly eroded away by a proliferative, invasive connective tissue called pannus, which is derived<br>
from the synovial membrane. The disease may involve peri-articular structures such as bursae, tendon<br>
sheaths and tendons as well as extra-articular tissues such as the subcutis, cardiovascular system, lungs,<br>
spleen, lymph nodes, skeletal muscles, nervous system (central and peripheral) and eyes (Silberberg (1985),<br>
Anderson's Pathology, Kissane (ed.), 11:1828). Osteoarthritis is a common joint disease characterized by<br>
degenerative changes in articular cartilage and reactive proliferation of bone and cartilage around the joint.<br>
Osteoarthritis is a cell-mediated active process that may result from the inappropriate response of<br>
chondrocytes to catabolic and anabolic stimuli. Changes in some matrix molecules of articular cartilage<br>
reportedly occur in early Osteoarthritis (Thonar et al. (1993), Rheumatic disease clinics of North America,<br>
Moskowitz (ed.), 19:635-657 and Shinmei et al. (1992), Arthritis Rheum., 35:1304-1308). TALL-1, TALL-1R and<br>
modulators thereof are believed to be useful in the treatment of these and related conditions.<br>
BAFF-binding molecules may also be useful in treatment of a number of additional diseases and<br>
disorders, including acute pancreatitis; ALS; Alzheimer's disease; asthma; atherosclerosis; autoimmune<br>
hemolytic anemia; cancer, particularly cancers related to B cells; cachexia/anorexia; chronic fatigue syndrome;<br>
cirrhosis (e.g., primary biliary cirrhosis); diabetes (e.g., insulin diabetes); fever; glomerulonephritis, including<br>
IgA glomerulonephritis and primary glomerulonephritis; Goodpasture's syndrome; Guillain-Barre syndrome;<br>
graft versus host disease; Hashimoto's thyroiditis; hemorrhagic shock; hyperalgesia; inflammatory bowel<br>
disease; inflammatory conditions of a joint, including Osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis and rheumatoid<br>
arthritis; inflammatory conditions resulting from strain, sprain, cartilage damage, trauma, orthopedic surgery,<br>
infection or other disease processes; insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; ischemic injury, including cerebral<br>
ischemia (e.g., brain injury as a result of trauma, epilepsy, hemorrhage or stroke, each of which may lead to<br>
neurodegeneration); learning impairment; lung diseases (e.g., ARDS); lupus, particularly systemic lupus<br>
erythematosus (SLE); multiple myeloma; multiple sclerosis; Myasthenia gravis; myelogenous (e.g., AML and<br>
CML) and other leukemias; myopathies (e.g., muscle protein metabolism, esp. in sepsis); neurotoxicity (e.g., as<br>
induced by HIV); osteoporosis; pain; Parkinson's disease; Pemphigus; polymyositis/dermatomyositis;<br>
pulmonary inflammation, including autoimmune pulmonary inflammation; pre-term labor; psoriasis; Reiter's<br>
disease; reperfusion injury; septic shock; side effects from radiation therapy; Sjogren's syndrome; sleep<br>
disturbance; temporal mandibular joint disease; thrombocytopenia, including idiopathic thrombocytopenia<br>
and autoimmune neonatal thrombocytopenia; tumor metastasis; uveitis; and vasculitis.<br>
Combination Therapy. The therapeutic methods, compositions and compounds of the present<br>
invention may also be employed, alone or in combination with other cytokines, soluble Mpl receptor,<br>
hematopoietic factors, interleukins, growth factors or antibodies in the treatment of disease states<br>
characterized by other symptoms as well as platelet deficiencies. It is anticipated that the inventive compound<br>
will prove useful in treating some forms of thrombocytopenia in combination with general stimulators of<br>
hematopoiesis, such as IL-3 or GM-CSF. Other megakaryocytic stimulatory factors, i.e., meg-CSF, stem cell<br>
factor (SCF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OSM), or other molecules with megakaryocyte<br>
stimulating activity may also be employed with Mpl ligand. Additional exemplary cytokines or hematopoietic<br>
factors for such co-administration include IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-11, colony<br>
stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), SCF, GM-CSF, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), EPO, interferonalpha<br>
(IFN-alpha), consensus interferon, IFN-beta, or IFN-gamma. It may further be useful to administer,<br>
either simultaneously or sequentially, an effective amount of a soluble mammalian Mpl receptor, which<br>
appears to have an effect of causing megakaryocytes to fragment into platelets once the megakaryocytes have<br>
reached mature form. Thus, administration of an inventive compound (to enhance the number of mature<br>
megakaryoctes) followed by administration of the soluble Mpl receptor (to inactivate the ligand and allow<br>
the mature megakaryocytes to produce platelets) is expected to be a particularly effective means of stimulating<br>
platelet production. The dosage recited above would be adjusted to compensate for such additional<br>
components in the therapeutic composition. Progress of the treated patient can be monitored by conventional<br>
methods.<br>
In cases where the inventive compounds are added to compositions of platelets and/or<br>
megakaryocytes and related cells, the amount to be included will generally be ascertained experimentally by<br>
techniques and assays known in the art. An exemplary range of amounts is 0.1 ug—1 mg inventive compound<br>
per 106 cells.<br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
In General<br>
The present invention also provides methods of using pharmaceutical compositions of the inventive<br>
compounds. Such pharmaceutical compositions may be for administration for injection, or for oral, pulmonary,<br>
nasal, transdermal or other forms of administration. In general, the invention encompasses pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprising effective amounts of a compound of the invention together with pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable diluents, preservatives, solubilizers, emulsifiers, adjuvants and/or carriers. Such compositions include<br>
diluents of various buffer content (e.g., Tris-HCl, acetate, phosphate), pH and ionic strength; additives such as<br>
detergents and solubilizing agents (e.g., Tween 80, Polysorbate 80), anti-oxidants (e.g., ascorbic acid, sodium<br>
metabisulfite), preservatives (e.g., Thimersol, benzyl alcohol) and bulking substances (e.g., lactose, mannitol);<br>
incorporation of the material into particulate preparations of polymeric compounds such as polylactic acid,<br>
polyglycolic acid, etc. or into liposomes. Hyaluronic acid may also be used, and this may have the effect of<br>
promoting sustained duration in the circulation. Such compositions may influence the physical state, stability, rate<br>
of in vivo release, and rate of in vivo clearance of the present proteins and derivatives. See, e.g., Remington's<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed. (1990, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA 18042) pages 1435-1712 which are herein<br>
incorporated by reference. The compositions may be prepared in liquid form, or may be in dried powder, such as<br>
lyophilized form. Implantable sustained release formulations are also contemplated, as are transdermal<br>
formulations.<br>
Oral dosage forms<br>
Contemplated for use herein are oral solid dosage forms, which are described generally in Chapter 89<br>
of Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (1990), 18th Ed., Mack Publishing Co. Easton PA 18042, which is<br>
herein incorporated by reference. Solid dosage forms include tablets, capsules, pills, troches or lozenges,<br>
cachets or pellets. Also, liposomal or proteinoid encapsulation may be used to formulate the present compositions (as, for example, proteinoid microspheres reported in U.S. Patent No. 4,925,673). Liposomal<br>
encapsulation may be used and the liposomes may be derivatized with various polymers (e.g., U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,013,556). A description of possible solid dosage forms for the therapeutic is given in Chapter 10 of Marshall,<br>
K., Modern Pharmaceutics (1979), edited by G. S. Banker and C. T. Rhodes, herein incorporated by reference.<br>
In,general, the formulation will include the inventive compound, and inert ingredients which allow for<br>
protection against the stomach environment, and release of the biologically active material in the intestine.<br>
Also specifically contemplated are oral dosage forms of the above inventive compounds. If necessary,<br>
the compounds may be chemically modified so that oral delivery is efficacious. Generally, the chemical<br>
modification contemplated is the attachment of at least one moiety to the compound molecule itself, where<br>
said moiety permits (a) inhibition of proteolysis; and (b) uptake into the blood stream from the stomach or<br>
intestine. Also desired is the increase in overall stability of the compound and increase in circulation time in<br>
the body. Moieties useful as covalently attached vehicles in this invention may also be used for this purpose.<br>
Examples of such moieties include: PEG, copolymers of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, carboxymethyl<br>
cellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and polyproline. See, for example, Abuchowski<br>
and Davis, Soluble Polymer-Enzyme Adducts, Enzymes as Drugs (1981), Hocenberg and Roberts, eds., Wiley-<br>
Interscience, New York, NY, , pp 367-83; Newmark, et al. (1982), T. Appl. Biochem. 4:185-9. Other polymers<br>
that could be used are poly-l,3-dioxolane and poly-l,3,6-tioxocane. Preferred for pharmaceutical usage, as<br>
indicated above, are PEG moieties.<br>
For oral delivery dosage forms, it is also possible to use a salt of a modified aliphatic amino acid, such<br>
as sodium N-(8-[2-hydroxybenzoyl] amino) caprylate (SNAC), as a carrier to enhance absorption of the<br>
therapeutic compounds of this invention. The clinical efficacy of a heparin formulation using SNAC has been<br>
demonstrated in a Phase II trial conducted by Emisphere Technologies. See US Patent No. 5,792,451, "Oral<br>
drug delivery composition and methods".<br>
The compounds of this invention can be included in the formulation as fine multiparticulates in the<br>
form of granules or pellets of particle size about 1 mm. The formulation of the material for capsule<br>
administration could also be as a powder, lightly compressed plugs or even as tablets. The therapeutic could<br>
be prepared by compression.<br>
Colorants and flavoring agents may all be included. For example, the protein (or derivative) may be<br>
formulated (such as by liposome or microsphere encapsulation) and then further contained within an edible<br>
product, such as a refrigerated beverage containing colorants and flavoring agents.<br>
One may dilute or increase the volume of the compound of the invention with an inert material. These<br>
diluents could include carbohydrates, especially mannitol, a-lactose, anhydrous lactose, cellulose, sucrose,<br>
modified dextrans and starch, Certain inorganic salts may also be used as fillers including calcium<br>
triphosphate, magnesium carbonate and sodium chloride. Some commercially available diluents are Fast-Flo,<br>
Emdex, STA-Rx 1500, Emcompress and Avicell.<br>
Disintegrants may be included in the formulation of the therapeutic into a solid dosage form. Materials<br>
used as disintegrants include but are not limited to starch including the commercial disintegrant based on<br>
starch, Explotab. Sodium starch glycolate, Amberlite, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, ultramylopectin,<br>
sodium alginate, gelatin, orange peel, acid carboxymethyl cellulose, natural sponge and bentonite may all be<br>
used. Another form of the disintegrants are the insoluble cationic exchange resins. Powdered gums may be<br>
used as disintegrants and as binders and these can include powdered gums such as agar, Karaya or<br>
tragacanth. Alginic acid and its sodium salt are also useful as disintegrants.<br>
Binders may be used to hold the therapeutic agent together to form a hard tablet and include materials<br>
natural products such as acacia, tragacanth, starch and gelatin. Others include methyl cellulose (MC),<br>
ethyl cellulose (EC) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) could both be used in alcoholic solutions to granulate the therapeutic.<br>
An antifrictional agent may be included in the formulation of the therapeutic to prevent sticking<br>
during the formulation process. Lubricants may be used as a layer between the therapeutic and the die wall,<br>
and these can include but are not limited to; stearic acid including its magnesium and calcium salts,<br>
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), liquid paraffin, vegetable oils and waxes. Soluble lubricants may also be used<br>
such as sodium lauryl sulfate, magnesium lauryl sulfate, polyethylene glycol of various molecular weights,<br>
Carbowax 4000 and 6000.<br>
Glidants that might improve the flow properties of the drug during formulation and to aid<br>
rearrangement during compression might be added. The glidants may include starch, talc, pyrogenic silica<br>
and hydrated silicoaluminate.<br>
To aid dissolution of the compound of this invention into the aqueous environment a surfactant might<br>
be added as a wetting agent. Surfactants may include anionic detergents such as sodium lauryl sulfate, dioctyl<br>
sodium sulfosuccinate and dioctyl sodium sulfonate. Cationic detergents might be used and could include<br>
benzalkonium chloride or benzethonium chloride. The list of potential nonionic detergents that could be<br>
included in the formulation as surfactants are lauromacrogol 400, polyoxyl 40 stearate, polyoxyethylene<br>
hydrogenated castor oil 10, 50 and 60, glycerol monostearate, polysorbate 40, 60, 65 and 80, sucrose fatty acid<br>
ester, methyl cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose. These surfactants could be present in the formulation of<br>
the protein or derivative either alone or as a mixture in different ratios.<br>
Additives may also be included in the formulation to enhance uptake of the compound. Additives<br>
potentially having this property are for instance the fatty acids oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid.<br>
Controlled release formulation may be desirable. The compound of this invention could be<br>
incorporated into an inert matrix which permits release by either diffusion or leaching mechanisms e.g.^ gums.<br>
Slowly degenerating matrices may also be incorporated into the formulation, e.g., alginates, polysaccharides.<br>
Another form of a controlled release of the compounds of this invention is by a method based on the Oros<br>
therapeutic system (Alza Corp.), i.e., the drug is enclosed in a semipermeable membrane which allows water<br>
to enter and push drug out through a single small opening due to osmotic effects. Some enteric coatings also<br>
have a delayed release effect.<br>
Other coatings may be used for the formulation. These include a variety of sugars which could be<br>
applied in a coating pan. The therapeutic agent could also be given in a film coated tablet and the materials<br>
used in this instance are divided into 2 groups. The first are the nonenteric materials and include methyl<br>
cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, methylhydroxy-ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose,<br>
hydroxypropyl-methyl cellulose, sodium carboxy-methyl cellulose, providone and the polyethylene glycols.<br>
The second group consists of the enteric materials that are commonly esters of phthalic acid.<br>
A mix of materials might be used to provide the optimum film coating. Film coating may be carried<br>
out in a pan coater or in a fluidized bed or by compression coating.<br>
Pulmonary delivery forms<br>
Also contemplated herein is pulmonary delivery of the present protein (or derivatives thereof). The<br>
protein (or derivative) is delivered to the lungs of a mammal while inhaling and traverses across the lung<br>
epithelial lining to the blood stream. (Other reports of this include Adjei et al., Pharma. Res. (1990) 7: 565-9;<br>
Adjei et al. (1990), Internatl. T. Pharmaceutics 63:135-44 (leuprolide acetate); Braquet et al. (1989), T. Cardiovasc.<br>

growth hormone); Debs et al. (1988), T. Immunol. 140: 3482-8 (interferon-y and tumor necrosis factor a) and<br>
Platz et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,284,656 (granulocyte colony stimulating factor).<br>
Contemplated for use in the practice of this invention are a wide range of mechanical devices designed<br>
for pulmonary delivery of therapeutic products, including but not limited to nebulizers, metered dose<br>
inhalers, and powder inhalers, all of which are familiar to those skilled in the art. Some specific examples of<br>
commercially available devices suitable for the practice of this invention are the Ultravent nebulizer,<br>
manufactured by Mallinckrodt, Inc., St. Louis, Missouri; the Acorn II nebulizer, manufactured by Marquest<br>
Medical Products, Englewood, Colorado; the Ventolin metered dose inhaler, manufactured by Glaxo Inc.,<br>
Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; and the Spinhaler powder inhaler, manufactured by Fisons Corp.,<br>
Bedford, Massachusetts.<br>
All such devices require the use of formulations suitable for the dispensing of the inventive<br>
compound. Typically, each formulation is specific to the type of device employed and may involve the use of<br>
an appropriate propellant material, in addition to diluents, adjuvants and/or carriers useful in therapy.<br>
The inventive compound should most advantageously be prepared in particulate form with an<br>
average particle size of less than 10 nm (or microns), most preferably 0.5 to 5 ^im, for most effective delivery<br>
to the distal lung.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include carbohydrates such as trehalose, mannitol, xylitol,<br>
sucrose, lactose, and sorbitol. Other ingredients for use in formulations may include DPPC, DOPE, DSPC<br>
and DOPC. Natural or synthetic surfactants may be used. PEG may be used (even apart from its use in<br>
derivatizing the protein or analog). Dextrans, such as cyclodextran, may be used. Bile salts and other related<br>
enhancers may be used. Cellulose and cellulose derivatives may be used. Amino acids may be used, such as<br>
use in a buffer formulation.<br>
Also, the use of liposomes, microcapsules or microspheres, inclusion complexes, or other types of<br>
carriers is contemplated.<br>
Formulations suitable for use with a nebulizer, either jet or ultrasonic, -will, typically comprise the<br>
inventive compound dissolved in water at a concentration of about 0.1 to 25 mg of biologically active protein<br>
per mL of solution. The formulation may also include a buffer and a simple sugar (e.g., for protein<br>
stabilization and regulation of osmotic pressure). The nebulizer formulation may also contain a surfactant, to<br>
reduce or prevent surface induced aggregation of the protein caused by atomization of the solution in forming<br>
the aerosol.<br>
Formulations for use with a metered-dose inhaler device will generally comprise a finely divided<br>
powder containing the inventive compound suspended in a propellant with the aid of a surfactant. The<br>
propellant may be any conventional material employed for this purpose, such as a chlorofluorocarbon, a<br>
hydrochlorofluorocarbon, a hydrofluorocarbon, or a hydrocarbon, including trichlorofluoromethane,<br>
dichlorodifluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethanol, and 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, or combinations thereof.<br>
Suitable surfactants include sorbitan trioleate and soya lecithin. Oleic acid may also be useful as a surfactant.<br>
Formulations for dispensing from a powder inhaler device will comprise a finely divided dry powder<br>
containing the inventive compound and may also include a bulking agent, such as lactose, sorbitol, sucrose,<br>
mannitol, trehalose, or xylitol in amounts which facilitate dispersal of the powder from the device, e.g., 50 to<br>
90% by weight of the formulation.<br>
Other delivery forms<br>
Nasal delivery of the inventive compound is also contemplated. Nasal delivery allows the passage of<br>
the protein to the blood stream directly after administering the therapeutic product to the nose, without the<br>
necessity for deposition of the product in the lung. Formulations for nasal delivery include those with dextran<br>
or cyclodextran. Delivery via transport across other mucous membranes is also contemplated.<br>
Buccal delivery of the inventive compound is also contemplated. Buccal delivery formulations are<br>
known in the art for use with peptides.<br>
Dosages<br>
The dosage regimen involved in a method for treating the above-described conditions will be determined by<br>
the attending physician, considering various factors which modify the action of drugs, e.g. the age, condition, body<br>
weight, sex and diet of the patient, the severity of any infection, time of administration and other clinical factors.<br>
Generally, the daily regimen should be in the range of 0.1-1000 micrograms of the inventive compound per kilogram<br>
of body weight, preferably 0.1-150 micrograms per kilogram.<br>
Specific preferred embodiments<br>
The inventors have determined preferred peptide sequences for molecules having many different<br>
kinds of activity. The inventors have further determined preferred structures of these preferred peptides<br>
combined with preferred linkers and vehicles. Preferred structures for these preferred peptides listed in Table<br>
11 below. Linker sequences are shown in bold. Active peptide sequences are shown in bold and<br>

Working examples<br>
The compounds described above may be prepared as described below. These examples comprise<br>
preferred embodiments of the invention and are illustrative rather than limiting.<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of Fc-loop-ang2<br>
In this example of the invention, the disulphide-constrained peptide TN8-Con4 was inserted into the<br>
human IgGl Fc-loop domain, defined as the sequence Di37Ei3sLi39Ti4oKi4i (Fig 2A.).<br>
TN8-Con4 QEECEWDPWTCEHM (SEQ ID NO: 147)<br>
The peptide insertion is between Fc residues Leui39 and Thrwo and includes 2 Gly residues as linkers flanking<br>
either side of the inserted peptide (Fig. 10A). The Fc-loop TN8-Con4 construct is labeled with Amgen clone<br>
#6888. The carboxy-terminal TN8-Con4 fusion peptibody (Fig. 10B) includes a 5 Gly linker and is labeled with<br>
Amgen clone #5564.<br>
Both clones #6888 and #5564 were transformed into E. coli by conventional methods known to those<br>
familiar in the art. Both clones were found to express at high levels and almost exclusively in the insoluble<br>
inclusion body fraction (Fig. 11). The isolated inclusion body fraction (1 g) was solubilized in 6 M guanidine-<br>
HC1, 50 mM Tris, 8 mM DTT, pH 9 (10 ml) at room temperature with mixing, for 1 hour. The denatured and<br>
reduced peptibodies were refolded from the solubilized inclusion bodies by a 1:25, (v/v) dilution into a refold<br>
buffer consisting of 2 M urea, 50 mM Tris, 4 mM cysteine, 1 mM cystamine, pH 8.5. The solubilized<br>
peptibodies were added drop wise to the refold buffer at 4 °C with stirring. The refold reactions were allowed<br>
to stir for 48 hours, and then aliquots were evaluated by SDS-PAGE and reverse-phase HPLC. The Fc-loop<br>
TN8-Con4 (#6888) is considerably more homogeneous in the refold reaction than the carboxy-terminal Fc TN8-<br>
Con4 peptibody (#5564) as shown by RP-HPLC (Fig. 12).<br>
Purification of the refolded Fc-loop TN8-Con4 and carboxy-terminal Fc TN8-Con4 was achieved using<br>
a 2-column process. First a recombinant Protein-A column was equilibrated in 2 M urea, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.5<br>
and loaded with the filtered peptibody refold reaction. The column was then washed with 2 column volumes<br>
of equilibration buffer, followed by 2 column volumes of PBS. The peptibody fraction was eluted with 50mM<br>
NaOAc, pH3 and quickly neutralized by a 1:4 dilution into 10 mM NaOAc, 50 mM NaCl, pH 5. The diluted<br>
Protein-A eluate was again filtered and loaded to an SP Sepharose HP cation exchange column (Pharmacia)<br>
equilibrated in 10 mM NaOAc, 50 mM NaCl, pH 5. The peptibody fractions were then eluted with a linear 50-<br>
500 mM NaCl gradient, pooled and concentrated to about 2 mg/ml. The final pools of Fc-loop TN8-Con4<br>
(#6888) and the carboxy-terminal Fc TN8-Con4 (#5564) were evaluated by RP-HPLC (Fig. 13) and SDS-PAGE<br>
(Fig. 14). Both RP-HPLC and SDS-PAGE demonstrate that improved product homogeneity is achieved with<br>
the Fc-loop TN8-Con4 (#6888) relative to the comparable carboxy-terminal fused peptibody (#5564).<br>
Both the Fc-loop TN8-Con4 and carboxy-terminal fused TN8-Con4 peptibodies were further evaluated<br>
in an in vitro ELISA for competitive inhibition of the angiopoietin 2 receptor. In this format the peptibody<br>
competes with an angiopoietin 2 receptor-Fc fusion for binding to immobilized angiopoietin 2. Binding of the<br>
angiopoietin 2 receptor-Fc fusion is monitored by fluorescence using an enzyme-linked immunodetection<br>
method and reported as an inhibition constant at 50% inhibition (ICso). This experiment shows that the Fcloop<br>
TN8-Con4 is fully active relative to the carboxy-terminal Fc TN8-Con4 (Fig. 15).<br>
Stability in vivo of the Fc-loop TN8-Con4 peptibody was compared to the carboxy-terminal TN8-Con4<br>
peptibody in mice. In this study groups of 15 mice were dosed subcutaneously with either peptibody<br>
construct at 5 mg/kg. At 4 hours after injection, 5 mice were sacrificed and serum collected. At 24 hours,<br>
another 5 mice were harvested and likewise at 48 hours. Each individual serum sample was evaluated by<br>
western blot for detectable human IgG-Fc peptibody. Since all the serum within each 5-mouse group was very<br>
similar, the groups were pooled to allow representative samples to be run together on a single gel/blot. The<br>
result of that analysis (Fig. 16) clearly shows that both the Fc-loop TN8-Con4 peptibody and the carboxyterminal<br>
TN8-Con4 peptibody persists in the pooled mouse sera throughout the 48-hour time course with no<br>
apparent loss. This result demonstrates that the Fc-loop designed peptibodies are not destabilized in vivo by<br>
the peptide insertion.<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of Fc-loop-myo7<br>
In another embodiment of this invention, a novel, disulphide-constrained peptide TN8-19-7 (U.S. Pat<br>
App 2004-0181033-A1, which is incorporated by reference) of the sequence:<br>
TN8-19-07 LADHGQCIRWPWMCPPEGWE (SEQ ID NO: 365)<br>
was engineered between Leul39 and Thrl40 as an internal fusion in the putative Fc-loop sequence DELTK of<br>
an IgGl Fc sequence (Fig 2A). An additional two Gly residues were also added at each end of the TN8-19-07<br>
peptide as flanking linkers. The final Fc-loop TN8-19-07 sequence is given in Figure 3A and is labeled clone #<br>
6951. Alternatively, a carboxy terminal fusion of TN8-19-07 with the same IgGl Fc sequence was prepared to<br>
serve as a control (Fig 3B) and labeled clone #6826. The carboxy-terminal fusion included five Gly residues<br>
between the Fc and TN8-19-07 to serve as a linker.<br>
Both clones #6951 and #6826 were transformed into E. coli by conventional methods used by those<br>
familiar in the art, and were found to express at high levels and almost exclusively in the insoluble inclusion<br>
body fraction (Fig. 4A and 4B). The isolated inclusion body fraction (1 g) was solubilized in 6 M guanidine-<br>
HCl, 50 mM Tris, 8 mM DTT, pH 9 (10 ml) at room temperature with mixing for 1 hour. The denatured and<br>
reduced peptibodies were refolded from the solubilized inclusion body fraction by a 1:25 (v/v) dilution into 2<br>
M urea, 50 mM Tris, 4 mM cysteine, 1 mM cystamine, pH 8.5. The solubilized peptibodies were added dropwise<br>
to the refold buffer at 4 °C with stirring. The refold reactions were allowed to stir for 48 hours, and then<br>
aliquots were evaluated by SDS-PAGE and reverse-phase HPLC. The Fc-loop TN8-19-07 (#6951) was found to<br>
be considerably more homogeneous by RP-HPLC (Fig. 5) in the refold reaction than the carboxy-terminal Fc-<br>
TN8-19-07 peptibody (#6826).<br>
Purification was achieved by a 2-column process. First a recombinant Protein-A column was<br>
equilibrated in 2 M urea, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.5 and loaded with the filtered peptibody refold reaction. The<br>
column was then washed with 2 column volumes of equilibration buffer, followed by 2 column volumes of<br>
PBS. The peptibody fraction was eluted with 50 mM NaOAc, pH 3 and quickly neutralized by a 1:4 dilution<br>
into 10 mM NaOAc, 50 mM NaCl, pH 5. The diluted Protein-A eluate was again filtered and loaded to an SP<br>
Sepharose HP cation exchange column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in 10 mM NaOAc, 50 mM NaCl, pH 5. The<br>
peptibody fractions were then eluted with a linear 50-500 mM NaCl gradient, pooled and concentrated to<br>
about 2 mg/ml. The final pools of Fc-loop TN8-19-07 (#6951) and the carboxy-terminal Fc TN8-19-07 (#6826)<br>
were evaluated by RP-HPLC (Fig. 6) and SDS-PAGE (Fig. 7). Both RP-HPLC and SDS-PAGE demonstrate that<br>
improved homogeneity in the final product is achieved with the Fc-loop TN8-19-07 (#6951) relative to the<br>
comparable carboxy-terminal fused peptibody (#6826).<br>
An in vitro cell-based assay, which measures the inhibition of myostatin signaling activity, was used to<br>
determine the bioactivity of the Fc-loop TN8-19-07 (#6951) compared to the carboxy-terminal fusion (#6826).<br>
In this assay, both constructs were titrated against 4 nM myostatin and evaluated for their ability to inhibit the<br>
myostatin signaling activity as measured by a luciferase reporter system. The relative peptibody activities are<br>
reported as the effective concentration for 50% inhibition (ECso). This experiment shows that the Fc-loop TN8-<br>
19-07 peptibody (#6951) retains full in vitro bioactivity (Fig. 8).<br>
Stability in vivo of the Fc-loop TN8-19-07 peptibody was compared to the carboxy-terminal TN8-19-07<br>
peptibody in mice. In this study, groups of 15 mice were dosed subcutaneously with either peptibody<br>
construct at 5 mg/kg. At 4 hours post injection 5 mice were sacrificed and serum collected. At 24 hours<br>
another 5 mice were harvested and likewise at 48 hours. Each individual serum was evaluated by western blot<br>
for detectable human IgG-Fc peptibody. Since all the serum within each 5-mouse group was very similar, the<br>
groups were pooled to allow representative samples to be run together on a single gel/blot. The result of that<br>
analysis (Fig. 9) clearly shows that the Fc-loop TN8-19-07 peptibody persists in the pooled mouse sera<br>
throughout the 48-hour time course with no apparent loss. In contrast, the concentration of the carboxyterminal<br>
TN8-19-07 peptibody diminishes steadily through the course of the study until it is nearly<br>
undetectable at the 48-hour time point. This result suggests that the Fc-loop design approach may confer<br>
additional in vivo stability to the TN8-19-07 peptibody.<br>

Example 6<br>
Preparation of Fc-loop-EMF<br>
This molecule was prepared as previously described in example 1.<br>
Example 7<br>
Preparation of Fc-loop-Amp2<br>
In another embodiment of this invention a linear, non-constrained peptide, AMP 2 was inserted into<br>
the human IgGl Fc -loop domain, defined as the sequence Dis/EissLisgTwoKi/u (Fig. 2A).<br>
AMP-2: IEGPTLRQWLAARA (SEQIDNO: 28)<br>
The Fc insertion is between Leuisg and Thruo and includes 2 Gly residues as linkers flanking either side<br>
of the inserted peptide (Fig. 3D). The Fc-loop AMP 2 construct is labeled as Amgen clone #6875.<br>
The Fc-loop AMP 2 clone (#6875) was transformed into E. coli by conventional methods known to<br>
those in the art and was found to express at high levels and almost exclusively in the insoluble inclusion body<br>
fraction (Fig. 17). The isolated inclusion body fraction (Ig) was solubilized in 6 M guanidine-HCl, 50 mM Tris,<br>
8 mM DTT, pH 9 (10 ml) at room temperature with mixing, for 1 hour. The denatured and reduced peptibody<br>
was refolded from the solubilized inclusion body fraction by a 1:25 (v/v) dilution into 2 M urea, 50 mM Tris, 4<br>
mM cysteine, 1 mM cystamine, pH 8.5. The solubilized peptibody was added drop wise to the refold buffer at<br>
4 °C with stirring. The refold reactions were allowed to stir for 48 hours, and then aliquots were evaluated by<br>
SDS-PAGE and reversed-phase HPLC<br>
Purification was achieved using a 2-column process. First a recombinant Protein-A column was<br>
equilibrated in 2 M urea, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.5 and loaded with the filtered peptibody refold reaction. The<br>
column was then washed with 2 column volumes of equilibration buffer, followed by 2 column volumes of<br>
PBS. The peptibody fraction was eluted with 50 mM NaOAc, pH3 and quickly neutralized by a 1:4 dilution<br>
into 10 mM NaOAc, 50 mM NaCl, pH 5. The diluted Protein-A eluate was again filtered and loaded to an SP<br>
Sepharose HP cation exchange column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in 10 mM NaOAc, 50 mM NaCl, pH 5. The<br>
peptibody fractions were then eluted with a linear 50-500 mM NaCl gradient, pooled and concentrated to<br>
about 2 mg/ml. The final pools of Fc-loop AMP 2 (#6875) were evaluated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 19) and RPHPLC<br>
(Fig. 20).<br>
The final preparation of Fc-loop AMP 2 was tested in an in vivo mouse bioassay against a carboxyterminal<br>
peptibody fusion of two AMP 2 sequences linked in tandem (Fc tandem AMP2). In this comparison,<br>
the Fc-tandem-AMP2 has a total valence of four AMP 2 peptides compared to the Fc-loop AMP 2 with only<br>
two peptides. The mice received a single subcutaneous injection of 50 ng/kg of either peptibody while their<br>
platelet levels were monitored over 15 days (Fig. 21). While the Fc-tandem-AMP2 induced a significant initial<br>
platelet increase, the total response was complete by day 9. In contrast, the Fc-loop AMP 2 elicited a much<br>
smaller response that peaked at day 8 and persisted for 15 days. These results suggest that the efficacious halflife<br>
of the Fc-loop AMP 2 peptibody may be much greater than the conventional carboxy-terminal fused<br>
peptibody. The difference in overall amplitude of the response may be a consequence of the greater valence of<br>
Fc-tandem-Amp2.<br>

Example 9<br>
In Vitro cell-based assay and the measurement of myostatin-signaling activity (Figure 8)<br>
To quantitate myostatin activity and its blockade, a luciferase reporter system was developed, referred<br>
to as pMARE-Luc, which senses Myostatin/Activin signaling strength. The pMARE-luc vector was<br>
constructed by subcloning a Smad-responsive CAGA tandem repeat sequence into a basic reporter plasmid<br>
pLuc-MCS containing a minimal promoter element (TATA box). The pMARE-luc vector was stably<br>
transfected into a skeletal muscle-derived C2C12 cell line (murine).<br>
Characterization of myostatin responses of the stable clones led to the identification of C2C12-based<br>
clonal reporter cell lines that were capable of detecting both myostatin and Activin signaling activities in 96-<br>
well format in a highly sensitive and reproducible manner.<br>

Starting from a concentration of 100 nM, Fc-loop peptibody and proper controls were serially diluted<br>
in liTRF buffer 3-fold, 9-times across a 96-well plate. Dilutions were then mixed with the following reagents<br>
on a 96-well black, round-bottomed assay plate: Streptavidin-Europium (1.6 nM), Biotinylated human<br>
angiopoietin-2 (8.0 nM), human Tie2-Fc-APC (10 nM). Assay plate was then incubated at room temperature<br>
with shaking for 2 hours. Plate next read on a Rubystar microplate reader (BMG Labtechnologies Inc.).<br>
Results were converted to %inhibition, and ICSOs were then calculated by analyzing the %inhibition values in<br>
the program GRAFIT 5.0 (IC50, 0-100% parameter).<br>

Alternate Fc-Loop Insertion Sites<br>
Having proven the feasibility of Fc-Loop insertion-style peptibodies with the L139/T140 insertion site using<br>
several different peptides, additional loops were surveyed in the Fc crystal structure. Using Fc-domain homology<br>
modeling, twelve different potential insertion sites were selected based on solvent accessible surface exposure, steric<br>
constraints within the loop, proximity to the Fc dimer interface and juxtaposition to sites of known effector function, such<br>
as the FcRn binding interface. The Fc-Loop sites that were identified as potential insertion sites are detailed and ranked.<br>
See Figure 2A and Table 12 below.<br>
Table 12<br>
Specific insertion sites for the human IgGl Fc sequence<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Of these potential insertion sites, six were expressed using the TN8-19-7 peptide insert (Example 2) and<br>
evaluated for refolding efficiency and in vitro activity. An additional construct was added which contained an<br>
asymmetric linker system Gly4/Gly6 engineered into the original loop insertion site (L139/T140) previously<br>
described. In all, seven new Fc Loop Myostatin constructs were refolded, purified, and tested for activity.<br>
The seven new Fc-Loop TN8-19-7 constructs that were tested included insertions in both CH2 and CH3<br>
domains of human IgGl Fc. Specifically, these insertions were: G201/N202 (CH3), E169/N170 (CHS),<br>
S181/D182 (CHS), H49/E50 (CH2), L139/T140 (G4-6) (CHS), Y77/N78 (CH2), and K107/A108 (CH2-CH3<br>
linker domain). These constructs were transformed into E. coli by conventional methods known in the art, and<br>
were found to express almost exclusively in the insoluble inclusion body fraction. Interestingly, the H49/E50,<br>
L139/T140 (G4-6) and Y77/N78 constructs appeared to have the highest levels of expression. The E169/N170,<br>
S181/D182, K107/108 showed moderate expression, and the G201/202 construct showed some expression, but<br>
very little.<br>
Those Fc-Loop TN8-19-7 constructs which expressed well in E. coli were purified by first solubilizing<br>
the isolated inclusion body fractions in 6 M Guanidine-HCl, 50 mM Tris, 8 mM DTT pH 9.0 (10 mL per Ig<br>
inclusion body) at room temperature with mixing for 1 hour. Then, a variety of refolding conditions were<br>
evaluated for each of the denatured and reduced Fc-Loop TN8-19-7 constructs to identify optimal refolding<br>
conditions. The three G201/N202, E169/N170, and S181/D182 constructs did not refold well under any of the<br>
conditions tested. Of the remaining four Fc-Loop TN8-19-7 constructs, L139/T140 (G4-6) refolded the best,<br>
while the remaining three H49/E50, Y77/N78 and K107/A108 refolded with sufficient yield to pursue further<br>
purification.<br>
Using optimized refold conditions, the denatured and reduced Fc-Loop TN8-19-7 constructs were<br>
refolded from the solubilized inclusion body fractions by a 1:25 (v/v) dilution into 4 M Urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl,<br>
0.16 M Arg-HCl, 20% glycerol, 3 M Cystine, 5 mM Cystamine pH 8.5. The solubilized peptibodies were added<br>
drop-wise to the refold buffer at 4°C with stirring. The refold reactions were allowed to stir for 72 hours, and<br>
subsequently purified chromatographically. Final purification was achieved by a 2-column chromatographic<br>
process, as described in Example 2.<br>
-The final pools of L139/T140 (G4-6), H49/E50, Y77/N78, and K107/108 were evaluated by RP-HPLC<br>
and SDS-PAGE, as illustrated in Figures 23 and 24. The yields from these four constructs are tabulated in<br>
Table 13.<br>
Table 13<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Among the four analogs purified the L139/T140 (G4-6) insertion site analog was produced with the<br>
best purity and in the highest yield.<br>
The purified Fc-loop insertion analogs were further analyzed for functional myostatin receptor binding<br>
activity using an in vitro cell based inhibition assay, as described in Example 9. The results are shown in Table<br>
14.<br>
Table 14<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The purified Fc-loop insertion analogs were further analyzed for FcRn binding using a Biacore assay<br>
system. Sample K107/A108 was not tested due to insufficient sample remaining after analysis. The ICso<br>
values determined using the in vitro cell based Myostatin inhibition assay, were similar for the L139/T140<br>
(G4-6) insertion and the original Fc-Loop #6951, whereas the Fc-loop insertions at H49/E50 and Y77/N78<br>
showed a reduced ability to inhibit myostatin (Figure 30). The Biacore FcRn binding experiments showed that<br>
H49/E50 and Y77/N78 bound the Fc receptor comparably to the control (Fc-Loop-lxTN8-19-7, #6951) with an<br>
EC50 of about 680 nM/ but L139/T140 (G4-6) had a lower and more favorable EC5o at around 220 nM<br>
In summary, of the six new insertion sites evaluated, three failed to refold efficiently. Among the three<br>
new insertion site analogs recovered, K107/A108 folded poorly, H49/E50 (CH2 domain) refolded marginally<br>
well, and the two remaining insertions at Y77/N78 (CH2 domain) and the original insertion site of L139/T140<br>
(CHS domain) with an extended, asymmetric linker folded with a higher efficiency. Interestingly, all of these<br>
novel insertion site analogs refolded with significantly lower yield than the original Fc-loop construct (#6951)<br>
with TN8-19-7 in position L139/T140 using symmetric Gly2 linkers.<br>
When tested for retention of FcRn binding capacity, all the Fc-loop molecules appeared similar in<br>
affinity with the possible exception of the extended, asymmetric linker construct, which seemed slightly better.<br>
This was consistent with the design paradigm to minimize steric interactions between the inserted peptide and<br>
the FcRn binding interface.<br>
While all the purified Fc-loop constructs were active by the in vitro, cell-based functional assay (Table<br>
14), the original insertion site (L139/T140) and the extended, asymmetric linker insertion at the same site<br>
appeared to be the most potent.<br>
This work demonstrates that multiple loop domains within the human IgGl Fc, as identified in Figure<br>
23, will tolerate insertion of bioactive peptides while preserving the activity of both the peptide and Fc effector<br>
functions such as FcRn binding. Peptide insertion analogs utilizing these Fc-lbop domains can vary<br>
significantly in refolding efficiency and peptide activity. Each peptide/insertion combination can be<br>
individually optimized to maximize recovery and potency.<br>
More preferable would be peptide insertions targeting the underlined sub-domains in Figure 23. Most<br>
preferable are the insertion site (L139/T140) and two additional loops in the CH2 domain (H49/E50 and<br>
Y77/N78).<br>
