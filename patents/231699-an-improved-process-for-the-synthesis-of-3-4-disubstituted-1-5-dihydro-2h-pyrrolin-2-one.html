				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the synthesis of 3-4-disubstituted-l, 5-dihydro-2H-3 -pyrrolin-2-one.<br>
The 3-4-disubstituted-l, 5-dihydro-2H-3-pyrrolin-2-one of formula 3 of the drawing accompanying this specification prepared by the process of the present invention are useful indirect building blocks for the synthesis of biologically important tetrapyrrole pigments such as bilirubin analogs (Y.S. Buyn &amp; D.A. Lightner, J. Het. Chem.28 (7) (1991) 1683 - 92),chlorin system (F. Peter Montforts , Angew. chem, 93(9) (1981) 793-96), phycocyanobilin (H. Ngwe, H. Kinoshita &amp; K. Inomata,Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn.67 (12) (1994) 3320-6), porphyrins for photodynamic therapy (PTD) and for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (R. Bohme &amp; E. Breitmaier, Synthesis, (12), 1999, 2096-2102) and also is an essential indirect intermediate for the synthesis of Glimepiride an antidiabetic drug (Drug of the Future 17(9) (1992) 774 -778).<br>
Two processes have hitherto been known  for the preparation of 3,4-disubstituted-l,5-dihydro-2H-3-pyiiolin-2-one of formula 3. In the first two steps<br>
	process (H. Plieninger and J. Kurze, Liebigs Ann. Chem. Bd. 680 (1964) 61 - 68) the<br>
	cynanohydrin of formula 1  (R1 = CH3 , R2 = C2H5, R3= C2H5) is hydrogenated,  in<br>
   acetic anhydride at 100 °C/ 105 arm. in presence of Raney Ni  for several hours in <br><br>
Parr autoclave followed by refluxing of filtrate for 6 hrs to give l-acetyl-3-ethyl-4-<br>
methyl dihydro-2H-3 pyrrolin-2-one   which on subsequent treatment with sodium<br>
carbonate gave 3 in 52% yield . Hence this process is industrially/commercially not<br>
	.      X feasible because of high pressure and high temperature hydrogenation and longer<br>
	time . The second process also comprised of two steps   (J.E. Bishop, <br>
J.F.O'Connel &amp; H. Raport, J.Am.Chem.Soc.(1991)113, 8024-8035). The cyanohydrin<br>
of formula 1 (R1 = CH3, R2 = C2H5, R3= C2H5) was hydrogenated with Raney Ni at lower pressure   and temperature   followed by prolonged heating (8 hrs.) to give a<br><br>
residue which was not identified.  The residue was hydrolysed with Na2CO3 and after cumbersome work up gave the product 3 in only 29% yield.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The main objective of the present invention is therefore to provide an improved process for the synthesis of 3,4-disubstituted-I,5-dihydro-2H-3-pyrrolin-2-one of formula 3 as defined above in terms of operational efficiency (low pressure and low temperature hydrogenation) and yield. In the present invention the high pressure and high temperature hydrogenation and prolonged refluxing of acetic anhydride after hydrogenation has been eliminated leading to quantitative yield (80%-90%) of the novel intermediate 2 which in turn was cyclised to 3. The isolation of the novel intermediate 2 is the key step in the improvement of the process.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to an improved process for the synthesis of 3,4-disubstituted-l, 5-dihydro-3-pyrrolin-2-one as given below,<br>
wherein R1 and R2 is H, a lower alkyl group is selected from methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, a branched chain alkyl subsistent selected from isopropyl, isobutyl, an aryl alkyl where in the aryl substitute is phenyl or substituted phenyl, a naphthyl group, a hetroaryl group such as pyridyl, pyrrole, furan, which comprises: hydrogenating cyanohydrins of formula 1 wherein R1 and R2 as stated above and R3 is methyl or ethyl with Raney Ni in acid anhydride at a temperature in the range of 15 - 35°C and pressure up to 50 psi, recovering the novel amino acetyl propyl compound of formula 2 wherein R1 &amp; R2 are as stated above and R3<br>
is C2H5, R4 is CH3 or C2H5 in 80-90% yield, treating the compound of formula 2 with alcoholic alkali at reflux temperature to cyclizes the compound of formula 2 to give pyrrolin-2-one of formula as given above wherein R1 and R2 are as stated above.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the cyanohydrin of formula 1 can be  prepared (Kuster,     Beil,  311 298)  from the  commercially available  ethyl<br><br>
acetoacetate or methyl acetoacetate, using conventional techniques, including but not limited to filtration, distillation and crystallization etc. such material may be characterised using conventional means including physical constants and spectral data.<br>

In further another embodiment of the present invention the aminoacetyl compound of formula 2 is novel.<br>
The novelty of the invention is as follows :<br>
(i)	The use of acetic anhydride has been limited at the hydrogenation<br><br>
step only,<br>
(ii)	After   hydrogenation acetic anhydride was completely removed<br>
and the next step was carried out using methanolic potassium<br>
hydroxide.<br>
(iii)	Potassium hydroxide was used in place of sodium carbonate,<br>
(iv)	Compounds of formula three having substituents as following are<br>
novel compounds.<br>

In step A, the cyanohydrin of formula 1 is hydrogenated with Raney Ni at 50 psi at room temperature (20°-33°C) in acetic anhydride. The removal of acetic anhydride under reduced pressure and work up gave the novel aminoacetyl derivative of formula 2 (4-acetylamino-2,3-dialkyl-3-hydroxy butanoic acid alkyl ester ) which is cyclised to 3-pyrrolin-2-one of formula 3 in step B using alcoholic alkali under reflux. Example 1 :<br>

dissolved in acetic anhydride (120 ml) and freshly prepared Raney-Ni catalyst (2 g) was added carefully. The suspension was stirred for 20 mins at room temperature and the catalyst was filtered and filtrate was hydrogenated with Raney Ni catalyst (6 g) at 50 psi at room temperature till the absorption of hydrogen ceased (12 hours). The solution was filtered through celite bed (8 g) and filtrate was concentrated at reduced pressure using an oil bath (80° - 100° C) to afford an oily residue. The oily residue was treated with distilled water (100 ml) and extracted with ethyl acetate (4 x 40 ml) Organic layer was dried (anhyd.

wherein R1 and R2 is H, a lower alkyl group is selected from methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, a branched chain alkyl subsistent selected from isopropyl, isobutyl, an aryl alkyl where in the aryl substitute is phenyl or substituted phenyl, a naphthyl group, a hetroaryl group such as pyridyl, pyrrole, furan, which comprises: hydrogenating cyanohydrins of formula 1 wherein R1 and R2 as stated above and R3 is methyl or ethyl with Raney Ni in acid anhydride at a temperature in the range of 15 - 35°C and pressure up to 50 psi, recovering the novel amino acetyl propyl compound of formula 2 wherein R1 &amp; R2 are as stated above and R3 is C2H5, R4 is CH3 or C2H5 in 80-90% yield, treating the compound of formula 2 with alcoholic alkali at reflux temperature to cyclizes the compound of formula 2 to give pyrrolin-2-one of formula as given above wherein R1 and R2 are as stated above.<br>
2.	The process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the hydrogenation temperature is from<br>
20-33°C.<br>
3.	The process as claimed in claims 1 to 2 wherein the pressure used is in the range<br>
of 45 to 50 psi.<br>
4.	The process as claimed in claims  1 to 3 wherein alcoholic alkali used is<br>
methanolic KOH/NaOH or ethanolic KOH/NaOH.<br>
5.	A process as claimed in claims 1 to 4 wherein the reflux temperature is 60°C (in<br>
case of methanol) and 80°C (in case of ethanol).<br>
6.	A process as claimed in claims 1-5 wherein the isolation of compound 3 is carried<br>
out by neutralizing the reaction mixture by hydrochloric acid.<br>
7.	A process as claimed in claims 1-6 wherein the compounds prepared by the<br>
process are: (i) 3-Ethyl-l, 5-dihydro-4-methyl-2H-3-pyrrolin-2-one (3,R1= CH3,<br>
R2 = C2H5); (ii) l,5-dihydro-4-methyl-3-propyl-2H-3-pyrrolin-2-one(3, R'= CH3,<br>
R2 - C3H7);(iii) l,5-Dihydro-3, 4-dimethyl-2H-3—pyrrolin-2-one(3, R1 =CH3, R2<br>
= CH3 ); (iv) 3-benzyl -l,5-dihydro-4-methyl-2H-3- pyrrolin-2-one(3, R1 = CH3,<br>
R=CH2C6H5); (v) 3-Ethyl-l, 5-dihydro-4-isopropyl 2H-3-pyrrolin-2-one (3.R1 -<br>
isoC3H7, R2 = C2H5);<br>
8.	A process as claimed in claims 1 - 7 wherein the acid anhydride used is selected<br>
from acetic anhydride, prop ionic anhydride.<br>
9.	A process for the synthesis of 3,4-disubstituted-l, 5-dihydro-2H-3-pyrrolin-2-one<br>
substantially as herein described with reference to the examples and drawing<br>
accompanying the specification.<br></td>
