Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 shows an improved system for converting gravitational power of earth into electrical power.<br>
Fig. 2 shows rim type pulley with supporting rod.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The invention relates to an improved system for converting gravitational power of earth into electrical power.<br>
The system comprises mainly a plurality of buckets, chain J-shaped water tank, a gate, mercury system, a rim type pulley having saw tooth circumference and gear system.<br>
The system comprises a plurality of hollow cylindrical shaped bucket, which float in water. Buckets are fixed with chain at equal distance from each other. Buckets enter one by one into J-shaped water tank through the gate provided at one end of the water tank due to weight of the mercury filled in the bucket. Mercury comes out from the bucket at the bottom of the water tank, then buckets go upward due to buoyancy and reach at the  top of the water tank one by one  and hang in<br>
air while passing over the pulley. Mass of hanging buckets produces a torque on the pulley, which revolves generator to produce electricity.<br>
A number of hollow cylindrical shaped buckets (B) made of strong material such as iron coated with steel or steel are provided such that one part of the bucket is closed and empty (CAE) and other part is open and empty (OAE). The bucket floats in liquid (Ex. Water) by this CAE part due to buoyancy. The OAE part may be equal or any times of the CAE part by volume, according to the requirement.<br>
More the empty part more is the electric power generation. Bucket can float in water only when the density of bucket is less than the density of water. But, the bucket is made up of metal, which is heavier than water, so to make the density of bucket less than water, some portion of bucket is closed. The outer side of bucket is made very smooth to reduce the friction in valve. The shape of the closed part of bucket can be of different shape as per the requirement. The different modules of system are as follows. The first module is Bucket. The design of Bucket is based on three points. 1. The Bucket should be of strong metal like iron or steel, 2. The Bucket should be easily passed through the gate of water tank with least energy, 3. Bucket should float in water. The valves (v) of the gate equally press the cylindrical shaped bucket which being inside the pipe (p). To get the power required for entry of<br>
bucket through gate into water tank, the bucket is filled with heavy liquid such as mercury (Hg).<br>
A chain made of strong metal such as iron which is polished and not affected by rust is passed through the bottom of each bucket. The gap between each two buckets (B) is constant such that the chain (N) can rotate round the bottom curved portion of J-shaped water tank. The chain can pass through the center of bottom of the bucket or through the side of the bottom of the bucket. If the chain is provided near to the side wall of bucket, then the buckets can take a turn with the minimum circumference of the chain at the curved portion of the tank which results in lesser gap between the buckets. Therefore, the number of buckets on the chain increase. This leads to increase in the generation of electrical power.<br>
A J-shaped water tank (ABCDEF) of a given height (h) is provided. A circular shaped gate is made near the bottom at one end (DE) of the tank. The internal shape of water tank can be of any shape such as cylindrical, polygon etc., which can hold water column of required height. The height of the water depends on the capacity of the system. A hole for gate (G) at the end (DE) of water tank and a hole for the exit of the mercury at the bottom of the water tank are made. The water tank is<br>
filled with water or any liquid, whose density is less than or equal to the density of water and which does not react with mercury, bucket and chain. The bottom of the water tank is made of such material which does not react with mercury.<br>
A gate (G) is made of the end (DE)of the water tank such that, the chain with buckets pass through the gate to enter into the water tank, take a turn and go upward through water. To prevent leakage of water through the gate when the bucket enters, a rubber valve such as o-ring is fitted within the pipe (P) and at the gate. The buckets pass through the gate without any leakage. The height of the gate from the bottom of the tank depends on the circumference of the curved portion of the chain. A pipe (p) having smooth inner side is fitted vertically on the gate such that required number of buckets can be kept one above the other within the pipe vertically. The number of buckets within the pipe depends on the height of the water tank (h).<br>
The buckets pass through the pipe vertically-downward smoothly maintaining a minimum possible distance from the pipe.<br>
Water in the water tank and mercury in the bucket is filled up simultaneously by keeping the buckets one upon the other on the gate. From this, equilibrium is maintained between the mercury filled bucket and pressure of water tank on gate. The thrust of water on gate is slightly less than the weight of buckets on gate. When the bottom most bucket enters into water tank then the top most bucket is filled with mercury and this cycle is continuous. The buckets go upward automatically due to water thrust (since buckets are lighter than water).<br>
The mercury system is used to fill the mercury into the bucket with least energy. In this system, a hole is made at the bottom of water tank A pipe (SXY) is fitted at this hole. Some quantity of mercury such as two bucket mercury is spread at the bottom of water tank. The water presses the mercury and as a result the Hg gets uplifted in to the pipe. The height of Hg in the pipe depends on the height of water in tank (shown in Table 1). To uplift the mercury from this height upto the required height so as to supply the same into the bucket, a pump or any mechanical system is required.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
During the movement of the chain, the filling of Hg into the bucket is difficult. Hence, at the top of the verticle pipe of gate another pipe (2) is provided, which is disposed with a plurality of holes. Hg goes to the pipe (2) from a cylindrical shaped bucket (1) attached just below the inner pipe (2). When the bucket comes into the pipe, the Hg is filled into the bucket through hole of inner pipe (2). Hg can get into the bucket only when bucket maintains a gap from the bucket above it. For this a valve (Vi) is provided just below the hole, which opens the hole when bucket maintains a gap from the bucket above it. After taking a turn buckets go upward through the water tank due to buoyancy and reach at the top of the water tank one by one to pass over pulley (R1) and hang in air on this pulley.<br>
The pulley can accommodate the buckets on its saw tooth circumference.<br>
Alternatively, a rim type pulley can be provided with rods from both the ends towards the centre. A spring is provided under or above or under and above each rod to make its movement flexible. The rod is having length such as l/3rd of diameter of bucket. The rods are provided at a minimum distance from each other in order not to be in contact with each other. When the buckets pass over the pulley, some rods from both the ends of rim move towards inner side. Some rods are pressed by the buckets and other rods remain horizontal. The horizontals rods produce required friction by preventing the free fall of bucket.<br>
The buckets are filled with the Hg when the chain is in motion. For this, speed of the chain is kept minimum possible upto for example 0.03 ml/sec. The speed of the chain is controlled by applying an external regarding power through generator preferably low rpm generator. For this reason, the speed of pulley Rl situated at the top of water tank-would be very less. The top pulley (pulley Rl) rotates generator. So a combination of small and big gears between the top pulley and generator is required. From this gear system, generator takes sufficient rotation<br>
when the top pulley speed is minimum. Pulley R is coupled with a generator via a number of small and big gears such that the generator takes required revolution when the speed of pulley R is required upto 0.01 ml/sec. The number of gears can vary according to the requirement. The pulley is having saw tooth circumference to accommodate the bucket therein.<br>
The bucket of mass (m) at height (h) exerts a torque mgR on the pulley (R) to produce power FV (where V-Rw) while falling freely in time (t). The power is transferred to generator by a gear system where m, g, h, f, v, R, w are mass of bucket, gravity, height of water tank, force, linear velocity, radius of pulley R and angular velocity R1. The shaft connecting the pulley with the gear and the gears is supported on pillar.<br>
Some portion of the water tank is provided underground. When it is required to replace the parts of the system above the gate then the chain is disconnected at the top level of the inner pipe and the buckets below it are pressed downward to accommodate the same under the lower level of valve (V) and the pipe (p) is closed at the bottom. This provision avoids displacement of the water from the water tank to serve the same purpose.<br>
It is to be noted that the present invention is susceptible<br>
modifications, adaptations and changes by those skilled in the art. Such variant embodiments employing the concepts and features of this invention are intended to be within the scope of the present invention, which is further set forth under the following claims:-<br><br><br><br><br><br>
