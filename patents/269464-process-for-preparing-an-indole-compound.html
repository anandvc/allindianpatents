FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of (E)-3-[3'-(4,,-FIuorophenyt)-r-(l-methylethyl)-lH-indoi-2-yl] prop-2-enal of Formula I.<br>
  Formula I<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(E)-3-[3'(4'-FIuorophenyO-l'-(l'-methylethyO-lH-indoi-2-yl]prop-2-enal is an important intermediate in the preparation of Fluvastatin. Fluvastatin, chemically known as [R*,S*-(EH±)-7-(3-(4-Fluorophenyl)-l-(l-methylethyl)-lH-indo!-2-yI]-3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid of Formula II, is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor.<br>
  Formula II<br>
Fluvastatin is presently marketed as its monosodium salt under the Trade name LESCOL. It is a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, which is responsible for the conversion of 3-hydroxy-3-methyIglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol.   Coronary heart disease is<br><br>
one of the major health problems in the developed world as well as in the developing world. A considerable amount of clinical data has emerged over the years linking elevated levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) as an important risk factor for the development of cornary heart disease.<br>
In the recent years, several companies have focused on finding effective and safe therapeutic agents to lower LDL-cholesterol. Wide range of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been developed from natural sources and also using synthetic chemistry skills.<br>
In view of the importance of Fluvastatin as cholesterol lowering agent several synthetic procedures have been reported in the literature. One such procedure, which caught our attention involves conversion of (E)-3-[3'-(4"-Fluorophenyl)-r(I"-methylethyl)-IH-indol-2-yI]prop-2-enal to Fluvastatin. However, only few synthetic methods are reported for the production of (E)-3-[3'-(4"-Fluorophenyl)-l '(1"-methylethyl)-1 H-indol-2-yl]prop-2-enal.<br>
US 5.354,772 discloses a process to prepare (E)-3-[3'-(4"-Fluorophenyl)-r(l"-methylethyl)-1 H-indol-2yl] prop-2-enal, which is shown in Scheme I.<br><br><br>
The disadvantage of the above process is more expensive with low yields.<br>
US 5,290,946 claims a process to prepare (E)-3-[3,-(4"-Fluorophenyl)-r-(l"-methylethyl)-1 H-indol-2-yl] prop-2-enal, which is shown in Scheme 2.<br><br>
The disadvantage of the above process is in the preparation of N-methyl-N-phenylacrolein of Formula III, which requires handling of highly hygroscopic salts and flammable reagents like butyl vinyl ether.<br>
In view of the above disadvantages, we have focused our research to develop a new economical and industrially advantageous method for the preparation of (E)-3-[3'-(4"-Fluorophenyl)-r( 1' "-methylethyl)- lH-indol-2-yl]prop-2-enal, an important intermediate in the synthesis of Fluvastatin.<br><br>
OBJECTIVE<br>
The objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for preparing (E)-3-[3'(4'-Fluorophenyl)-1'(1 "-methylethyl)-! H-indol-2-yl]prop-2-enal, which is safe and non-hazardous.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for preparing (E)-3-[3'(4'-Fluorophenyl)-r(l"-methylethyl)-lH-indol-2-yl]prop-2-enal, which is simple, industrially feasible and economically viable.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
■-■"'—	  ^™^^—^^—^««&gt;^"WBfi ■! ■<br><br><br>
with an organometallic reagent in    a suitable solvent to produce an alcohol of Formula VI1<br><br>
ii) treating alcohol of Formula VII with Vilsmeier reagent in a suitable solvent and iii) isolating the compound of Formula I thus obtained.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for the conversion of (E)-3-[3,-(4"-Fluorophenyl)-r-(r,-methylethyl)-lH-indol-2-yl] prop-2-enal (indole acrolein) of Formula I to Fluvastatin by processes known in the art.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In an aspect of the present invention, the organometallic reagent is selected from R'-Mg-X or R1/M, wherein R1 is selected from an alkyl group having C1-3 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl etc.; n represents an integer 1 or 2; M represents a metal cation selected from Lithium, Zinc, Cadmium etc., X represents a halide selected from chlorine, bromine, iodine etc, but when M represents Lithium, n represents 1 and when M represents Zinc or Cadmium, n represents 2. Further the solvent used in the reaction is selected from ethers such as diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, tetrahydro furan, dimethyl ether and mixtures thereof; hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene,  xylene  and  mixtures thereof;  halogenated  solvents  such  as  methylene<br><br>
dichloride, ethylene dichloride, chloroform and mixtures thereof and the reaction is carried out at a temperature of 0°C to 100°C, preferably 0°C to 20°C.<br>
In yet another aspect of the present invention, the Grignard reagent is added in 1 mole to 12 mole equivalents based on the indole carboxaldehyde of the Formula VI.<br>
In yet another aspect of the present invention, Vilsmeier reagent is used in 2 mole equivalents to the alcohol of Formula VII. The 2 moles of Vilsmeier reagent are used in one lot or can be used in two lots. If alcohol is treated with 2 mole equivalents of Vilsmeier reagent in one lot, indole acrolein of Formula I is obtained directly. On the contrary if alcohol is treated with 1 mole equivalent of Vilsmeier reagent, an intermediate 2-(3-(4,-fluorophenyl)-l-(r-methylethyl)-lh-indol-2-yl]ethylene of Formula VIII is obtained,<br>
  Formula VIII<br>
which on treatment with another mole equivalent of Vilsmeier reagent yields indole acrolein of Formula I.<br>
In yet another aspect of the present invention, the Vilsmeier reagent is prepared using N, N-dimethylformamide and phosphorous oxychloride or N, N-dimethylformamide and oxalyl chloride. The solvent used in step (ii) is selected from N, N-dimethylformamide, methylene dichloride, ethylene dichloride or mixtures thereof.<br><br>
Yet another aspect of the present invention, the product is isolated in step (iii) using an aqueous inorganic base such as such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate or sodium acetate.<br>
Yet another aspect of the present invention, the crude indole acrolein is recrystallised from hexane / ethyl acetate.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a novel intermediate, of Formula VII.<br>
  Formula VII<br>
wherein R1 represents an alkyl group having C1-3 carbon atoms.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a novel intermediate, of Formula VIII.<br>
  Formula VIII<br><br>
