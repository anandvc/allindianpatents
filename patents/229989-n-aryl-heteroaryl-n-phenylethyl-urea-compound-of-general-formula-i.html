				<td>The urea derivatives of the present invention are antagonists of the α4 integrins, both the α4ß1 integrin (VLA-4, "Very Late Antigen-4" or CD49d/CD29) and/or the α4ß7 integrin (LPAM-1  and α4ßp), thereby blocking the binding of α4ß1  to its various ligands, such as VCAM-1, osteopontin and regions of fibronectin and/or the binding of α4ß7 to its various ligands, such as. MadCAM-1, VCAM-1 and fibronectin.<br>
Through this mechanism of action the compounds of the invention inhibit cell (e.g. leukocyte) adhesion, activation, migration, proliferation and differentiation and are useful therefore in the treatment, prevention and suppression of immune or inflammatory disorders and of other diseases mediated by α4ß1 and/or α4ß7 binding and/or by cell adhesion and activation, such as multiple sclerosis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, inflammatory lung diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, septic arthritis, type I diabetes, organ transplantation, restenosis, autologous bone marrow transplantation, inflammatory sequelae of viral infections, atopic dermatitis, myocarditis, inflammatory bowel disease including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, certain types of toxic and immune-based nephritis, contact dermal hypersensitivity, psoriasis, tumor metastasis, atherosclerosis and cerebral ischemia.<br>
This invention also relates to compositions containing such compounds, to processes for their preparation, and to methods of treatment using such compounds. According to one aspect of the present invention we provide a particular group of compounds which are potent inhibitors of the binding ofα4ß1 and/or α4ß7 integrins to their ligands.<br>
Many physiological processes require that cells come into close contact with other cells and/or extracellular matrix. Such adhesion events may be required for cell activation, migration, proliferation and differentiation. Cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions are mediated through several families of Cell Adhesion Molecules (CAMs) including the selectins, integrins, cadherins and the immunoglobulins superfamily. CAMs play an essential role in both normal and pathophysiological processes. Therefore, the targetting of specific and relevant CAMs in certain disease conditions without interfering with normal cellular functions is essential for an effective and safe therapeutic agent that inhibits cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. One family of adhesion molecules that is believed to play a particularly important role in regulating immune and inflammatory responses is the integrin family.<br>
The   integrin   family   is   made   up   of  structurally   and   functionally   related glycoproteins consisting of α and ß heterodirneric, transmembrane receptor molecules<br><br>
found in various combinations on nearly every mammalian cell type, (for reviews see: E.G. Butcher, Cell, 67, 1033 (1991); T.A. Springer, Cell, 76, 301 (1994); D. Cox et al., "The Pharmacology of Integrins", Medicinal Research Rev., 14, 195 (1995) and V.W. Engleman et al., "Cell Adhesion Integrins as Pharmaceutical Targets" in Ann. Repts. In Medicinal Chemistry, Vol. 31, J.A. Bristol, Ed.; Acad. Press, NY, 1996, p. 191). At least 14 different integnn a chains and 8 different integrin (3 chains have been identified (A. Sonnenberg, Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology, 184, 7, (1993)). The members of the family are typically named according to their heterodimer composition although trivial nomenclature is widespread in this field. Thus the integrin termeda4(31 consists of the integrin a4 chain associated with the integrin (31 chain, and the integrin termed a4(37 consists of the integrin a4 chain associated with the integrin (37 chain. Not all the potential pairings of integrin a and p chains have yet been observed in nature and the integrin family has been subdivided based on the pairings that have been recognized (A. Sonnenberg, ibid; S.A. Mousa et al., Drugs Discovery Today, 2, 187 (1997)).<br>
One particular integrin subgroup of interest involves the a4 chain, which can pair with two different p chains, (31 and (37. a4p1 (VLA-4, "very late antigen-4"; or CD49d/CD29) is an integrin expressed on all leukocytes, except platelets, including dendritic cells and macrophage-like ceils and is a key mediator of the cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions of these cell types (see M.E. "VLA Proteins in the Integrin Family: Structures, Functions, and their Role on Leukocytes." Ann. Rev. Immunol., 8, 365 (1990)). The ligands fora4p1 include vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), the CS-1 domain of fibronectin (FN) and osteopontin. VCAM-1 is a member of the Ig superfamily and is expressed in vivo on endothelial cells at sites of inflammation. (See R. Lobb et al., "Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1" in Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms of Inflammation, C.G. Cochrane and M.A. Gimbrone, Eds.; Acad. Press, San Diego, 1993, p. 151). VCAM-1 is produced by vascular endothelial cells in response to pro-inflammatory cytokynes (see A.J. H. Gearing and W. Newman, "Circulating adhesion molecules in disease/, Immunol. Today, 14, 506 (1993)). The CS-1 domain is a 25 aminoacid sequence that arises by alternative splicing within a region of fibronectin. (For a review, see R.O. Hynes "Fibronectins", Springer-Verlag, NY, 1990). A role for a4(31/CS-1 interactions in inflammatory conditions has been proposed (see M.J. Elices, "The integrin a4|31 (VLA-4) as a therapeutic target" in Cell Adhesion and Human disease, Ciba Found. Symp., John Wiley &amp; Sons, NY, 1995, p. 79). Osteopontin is expressed by a number of cell types including osteoclasts, osteoblasts, macrophages, activated T-cells, smooth muscle cells and epithelial cells<br><br>
(C.M. Giachelli et al., "Molecular and cellular biology of osteopontin: Potential role in cardiovascular disease", Trends Card. Med., 5, 88 (1995)).<br>
a4(37 (also referred to as LPAM-1 and a4|3p) is an integrin expressed on leukocytes and is a key mediator of leukocyte trafficking and homing in the gastrointestinal tract (see C.M. Parker et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 89, 1924 (1992)). The ligands for a4(37 include mucosal addressing cell adhesion molecule-1 (MadCAM-1) and, upon activation ofa4|371 VCAM-1 and fibronectin (Fn). MadCAM-1 is a member of the Ig superfamily and is expressed in vivo on endothelial cells of gut-associated mucosal tissues of the small and large intestine ("Peyer's Patches") and lactating mammary glands. (See M.J. Briskin et al., Nature, 363, 461 (1993); A. Hammann et al., J. Immunol., 152, 3282 (1994)). MadCAM-1 can be induced in vitro by proinflammatory stimuli (See E.E. Sikarosky et al., J. Immunol., 151, 5239 (1993)). MadCAM-1 is selectively expressed at sites of lymphocyte extravasation and specifically binds to the integrin a4|37.<br>
Neutralizing anti-a4 antibodies or blocking peptides that inhibit the interaction between a4(31 and/or a4£7 and their ligands have proven efficacious both prophylactically and therapeutically in several animal models of inflammation and in humans (X.-D. Yang et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA,90, 10494 (1993), P.L. Chisholm et al., Eur. J. Immunol., 23, 682 (1993), T.A. Yednock et al., Nature, 356, 63 (1992), R.R. Lobb et al., J. Clin. Invest., 94, 1722 (1994), J. Relton, Drug News Perspect., 14, 346 (2001), N. Turbridy et al., Neurology, 53, 466 (1999)). The primary mechanism of action of such antibodies appears to be the inhibition of lymphocyte and monocyte interactions with CAMs associated with components of the extracellular matrix and vascular endothelium, thereby limiting leukocyte migration to extravascular sites of injury or inflammation and/or limiting the priming and/or activation of leukocytes.<br>
Since the discovery of their key role in mediating inflammatory pathophysiology, a4|31 and a4(37 have received considerable attention as drug design targets. Important advances have been made in identifying potent and selective candidates for further development strongly suggesting that a4(31 and a4(37 should be tractable small molecule targets (S.P. Adams et al., "Inhibitors of Integrin Alpha 4 Beta 1 (VLA-4)" in Ann. Repts. In Medicinal Chemistry, Vol. 34, W.K. Hagmann, Ed.; Acad. Press, NY, 1999, p. 179).<br>
There still remains a need for low molecular weight, specific inhibitors ofa4p1 and   cc4(37-dependent   cell   adhesion   that   have   improved   pharmacokinetic   and pharmacodynamic properties such as oral bioavailability and significant duration of action. Such compounds would prove to be useful for the treatment, prevention or<br><br>
suppression of various pathologies mediated by a4|31 and o.4p7 binding and cell adhesion and activation.<br>

In any of the heregoing general description of the synthesis of compounds of Formula I, intermediate compounds at any stage may contain protecting groups to protect funcionalities which would otherwise react under the conditions described. Such protecting groups are added and removed at appropiate stages during the synthesis of compounds of Formula I and the chemistries of such protections and deprotections are well described in the prior art (for example: T.W.

Where it is desired to obtain a particular enantiomer of a compound of Formula I this may be produced from the corresponding mixture of enantiomers using a suitable conventional procedure for resolving enantiomers. Thus for example, diastereomeric derivatives, e.g. salts, may be produced by reaction of a mixture of enantiomers of Formula I e.g. a racemate, and an appropiate chiral compound, e.g. a chiral base. The diastereomers may then be separated by any convenient means, for example by crystallisation and the desired enantiomer recovered, e.g. by treatment with an acid in the instance where the diastereomer is a salt. In another resolution process a racemate of Formula I may be separated using chiral High Performance Liquid Chromatography.<br>
Alternatively, if desired, a particular enantiomer may be obtained by using an appropiate chiral intermediate in one of the processes described above.<br>
The compounds of Formula I can be converted by methods known per se into pharmaceutically acceptable salts, preferably acid addition salts by treatment with organic or inorganic acids such as fumaric, tartaric, citric, succinic or hydrochloric acid. Also compounds of Formula I in which there is the presence of an acidic group may be converted into pharmacologically acceptable salts by reaction with an alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium or potassium hydroxide or an organic base. The acid or alkali addition salts so formed may be interchanged with suitable pharmaceutically acceptable counterions using processes known perse.<br>

On the other hand, it may be necessary to use dosages outside these limits in some cases.<br>
Any suitable route of administration may be employed for providing a mammal, especially a human, with an effective dosage of a compound of the present invention. For example, oral, rectal, topical, parenteral, ocular, pulmonary, nasal, and the like may be employed. Dosage forms include tablets, troches, dispersions, suspensions, solutions, capsules, creams, ointments, aerosols, and the like.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a a compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Accordingly, the method of treatment or use of the present invention may also involve pharmaceutical compositions which comprise any compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
The term "composition", as in pharmaceutical composition, is intended to encompass a product comprising the active ingredient(s), and the inert ingredient(s) (pharmaceutically acceptable excipients) that make up the carrier, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination, complexation or aggregation of any two or more of the ingredients, or from dissociation of one or more of the ingredients. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention encompass any composition made by admixing a compound of the invention additional active ingredient(s), and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
The expression "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids including inorganic bases or acids and organic bases or acids.<br>
The compositions include compositions suitable for oral, rectal, topical, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous), ocular (opthalmic), pulmonary (aerosol inhalation), or nasal administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the conditions being treated and on the nature of the active ingredient. They may be<br>
conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methodswell-known in the art of pharmacy.<br>
In practical use, the compounds of the invention can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or parenteral (including intravenous). In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavouring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations, such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, capsules and tablets, with the solid oral preparations being preferred over the liquid preparations. Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dose unit form in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. If desired, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques.<br>
Compositions for parenteral injection may be prepared from soluble salts, which may be or may not be freeze-dried and which may be dissolved in pyrogen free aqueous media or other appropriate parenteral injection fluid.<br>
