				<td>Description<br>
Solar Cell Array and Method for Connecting a Solar Cell String<br>
Tha method pertains to a solar cell array comprising of at least one solar cell with photoactive<br>
semiconductor layers running between front contact and back contact, as well as at least one<br>
discrete protective diode connected to the solar cell with a substrate made of semiconductor<br>
material of a first conductivity, in a layer formed on the surface region of the substrate or on<br>
the surface region of applied layer of second conductivity, a first metallic contact on the layer<br>
of the second conductivity and a second metallic contact arranged on the substrate, whereby<br>
connectors go out from the first and the second metallic contact for connecting the protective<br>
diodes. The invention further pertains to a method for connecting a solar cell string.<br>
The focus of semiconductor-solar cell-production, on account of the significantly higher<br>
degree of effectiveness in the conversion of sunlight into current, from the cost-effective<br>
silicon to III-V-semiconductor-solar cells (III = elements of the IIIrd group of the period<br>
system like Ga or In; V=elements of the Vth group of the period system like As or P) that are<br>
significantly costlier in material and production.<br>
In the corresponding solar cells production of the photoactive layers takes place in a<br>
cumbersome crystalline epitaxy by separating mostly a large number of different layers<br>
single-crystalline on a single crystalline germanium-disk (Ge-substrate wafer) that is<br>
comparatively much more expensive than silicon. This epitaxy wafer after layer separation<br>
contains all elements required for conversion of sunlight. After production they are then<br>
further processed into solar cells in usual photolithographic method used in semiconductor<br>
technology and etching, metallization- and anti-reflection damping etc. and ultimately cut-off<br>
from the wafer.<br>
By suitable choice of the layers and their composition of various III-V-materials, for different<br>
wavelengths of life different sensitive layer sequences are separated above one another and<br>
processed into so-called "multi-junction"-solar cells, which explains the high degree of<br>
effectiveness of a cell. The current state of application is triple cells, i.e. three sub-cells<br>
whereby two are made of epitactically grown III-V-material and the third one consists of the<br><br>
2<br>
actively mixed Ge-substrate. Generally nowadays III-V-solar cells are produced from round<br>
wafers (substrates) of 100 mm diameter (4"-wafer).<br>
A triple cell is a pre-time cells with three solar cells (3 cells (sub-cells) layered above one<br>
another and serially connected with different spectral sensitivity for enhancing the total<br>
effectiveness degree of triple cells; "multi-junction" cell: cell with several sub-cells).<br>
Suitable multi-junction solar cells in the form of triple cell could for example consist of a Ge-<br>
bottom-cell formed on the Ge-substrate, a GaInAs-centre cell and a GaInP top cell.<br>
The price of the epitaxy wafer is actually more than 20 times the price of a silicon wafer of<br>
the same size for producing silicon solar cells. On account of the high price of the starting<br>
material in the form of epitaxy wafer for producing III-V-solar cells, for reducing the wastage<br>
in the solar cell manufacturing process the number of processed steps are kept as low as<br>
possible in order to thereby avoid further cost increase in the end price of the cell.<br>
On account of the greater specific weight of III-V-compounds and germanium as compared to<br>
silicon (approx. factor 4) and the high transportation costs of satellites into space, the III-V-<br>
wafers are thinner than the usual ones in standard semiconductor technology (e.g. IC-<br>
production), whereby the failure risk in case of increase production complication is even more<br>
enhanced, especially as the Ge-substrates are much more brittle than Si-wafers.<br>
In order to keep the complication of joining to cells to strings (unit of serially connected solar<br>
cells to a desired working voltage on a panel; panel = Paneele; surface (wing) fitted with solar<br>
cell as indicated in satellite) as less as possible and at the same time not to get too short<br>
strings, as the working voltage of the modern III-V-cells is several times that of Si-cells,<br>
relatively large cells are desired. At the same time, the high price of the epitaxy wafer makes<br>
a desirable to use as much surface of the wafer as possible for the cells. Therefore, due to cost<br>
reasons cells of approx. 8 cm x 4 cm with two so-called cropped corner cells have become<br>
usual, whereby from a 4"-wafer two cells are obtained. By separating the corners a larger<br>
portion of the wafer surface can be used for the cell than in case of purely rectangular cells.<br>
In case of a qualitatively inadequate wafer edge of 2 mm width, a wafer of 100 mm diameter,<br>
one obtains a surface of 72.4 cm2. Two rectangular cells can attain a maximum surface of<br><br>
3<br>
6.79 cm x 6.79 cm = 46.1 cm2 (64%), whereas with two cells of 8 cm x 4 cm edge length with<br>
cropped corners of say 1.35 cm one obtains a surface of 60.34 cm2, so that 83% of the wafer<br>
face can be utilised. Due to reasons of geometry these cells do not completely fill up the<br>
surface of a panel: at the corners between the cells there remains a triangular surface not<br>
utilised for light conversion.<br>
In large-faced semiconductor diodes like the ones forming solar cells, high-ohm, local, small<br>
dimensioned electrical connections through the p/n junction of the semiconductor material<br>
(micro-short circuits) are often unavoidable, like e.g. through surface damages during<br>
production or especially in epitaxied p/n junctions as in III-V-solar cells through doping<br>
substance accumulations, e.g. in crystal damages (e.g. damages on account of slightly varying<br>
crystal screens). These micro-short circuits that do not or only very slightly reduce the<br>
function of the diodes as solar cells (p/n-junction in flow direction), could lead to destruction<br>
of the cell in the string during operation of the cell in locking direction. In case of locking<br>
p/n-junction the solar current can get pressed from the high string voltage U with the power<br>
N=Us.Is on account of the high-ohm micro-short circuits. This can locally lead to strong<br>
heating, un-doping and low ohm (strong degeneration of the semiconductor) and ultimately to<br>
destruction of the cell. Protection against the destruction can be effective by a so-called<br>
bypass or protection diode, i.e. an anti-parallel to the diode connected to the p/n-junction of<br>
the shadowed cell which is poled in flow direction when the p/n-junction of the cell locks and<br>
allows the current to pass at a voltage Ud that corresponds to the characteristic curve of this<br>
diode in flow direction with this current. The voltage Ur at the end of the string gets reduced<br>
due to the missing voltage Um of the cell and the flow voltage of the diode - Ud: Ur=Us -<br>
Um - Ud. In not shadowed condition of the cell the p/n-junction of the protective diode<br>
blocks the current flow through the same at a blocking voltage that merely conforms to the<br>
flow voltage of the allied solar cell.<br>
Usage of protective diodes for the cells to prevent destruction of individual cells in the string<br>
with shadowing in the form of anti-parallel diodes electrically connected to the cells is<br>
actually known.<br>
For III-V-cells there exists as solution monolithic integrated protective diodes, i.e. diodes that<br>
are produced from similar elements like the cells already during production of the epitaxy<br>
directly on the wafer in mostly additional process steps and in additional technology steps<br><br>
4<br>
processed into such while produced into cells and are then also situated on the cells (refer to<br>
DE-A-3 826 721, US-A-2002/0179141).<br>
A basic disadvantage of these solutions is that the active surface of the cell gets reduced. The<br>
protective diodes are therefore generally selected as small as possible in their dimension. In<br>
this way their voltage during current flow and hence their power gets enhanced. This can lead<br>
to their destruction in the long run or - as the protective diode is part of the cell - lead to<br>
locally undesirable strong heating of the cell.<br>
As monolithic diodes required additional effort even at the wafer level, i.e. additional epitaxy<br>
layers and additional technological processes during production of the cells, these constitute<br>
an additional cost factor that is not negligible. As the monolithic diodes can only be made of<br>
screen-adapted III-V-material, only a very small freedom in choice of the type of diode (only<br>
III-V-diodes with high flow voltage) is possible.<br>
Therefore, a discrete diode that can be produced independent of the production of the cell and<br>
hence also offers more material freedom, should be preferred. This has the additional<br>
advantage of being selected and tested independent of the cell, so that a diode already<br>
damaged during production does not simultaneously mean an expensive unusable cell.<br>
Fixing discrete diodes on to the solar cells as alternative to the monolithic integrated<br>
protective diodes generally calls for additional effort on the part of manufacturers of solar<br>
panels while fixing. This applies particularly for rectangular solar cells that completely fill up<br>
the surface of the panel, so that for fixing the protective diodes one has to deviate into the<br>
third dimension (leads and diode below the cells). This means a high degree of effort and<br>
complication in the panel manufacture. Besides, the weight of the panel will increase on<br>
account of the additionally required long lead cable.<br>
From the document US-A-4, 481, 378 we can see a solar cell module with serially connected<br>
solar cells and protective diodes, whereby respectively one protective diode is respectively<br>
connected anti-parallel to one cell. The protective diodes are connected to adjacent cells with<br>
the back sides and arranged in the intermediate spaces between the solar cells.<br><br>
5<br>
According to the document US-B-6, 563, 289 a corner is cropped from an originally<br>
rectangular solar cell and connected as protective diode with opposite pole to the solar cell.<br>
A solar cell array according to the document US-B-6, 353, 176 comprises of solar cells with<br>
recessed corners into which protective diodes can be arranged.<br>
A solar cell array with current limiting protection according to US-B-6, 034, 322 comprises of<br>
rectangular cells with an inclined edge at one corner into which a triangular diode is arranged<br>
for protecting the solar cell. Only such connectors are used that allow a movement in the<br>
plane of the solar cells.<br>
According to the document US-A-2003/0029494 protective diodes are integrated in a solar<br>
cell string, whereby one connector leads from the front side of the protective diode to the back<br>
side of an adjacent solar cell that is connected with the front side of the solar cell to be<br>
protected serially in the string. The back side contact of the protective diode leads to the back<br>
side of the cell to be protected.<br>
It is the task of this invention to further develop a solar cell array of the type described above<br>
in such a way that to an adequate extent a solar cell or a solar cell bunch like string can be<br>
protected by one or more protective diodes, without having to compulsorily fall back on the<br>
materials of the solar cells themselves. Furthermore, a smooth connection between the<br>
protective diodes and the solar cells should be possible, whereby at the same time a huge<br>
increase in weight should be avoided.<br>
This task is fulfilled according to the invention, in that the second contact directly contacts the<br>
substrate of a protective diode and is arranged beside the first metallic contact at a distant to it<br>
and is connected to the first metallic contact electrically through a p/n-junction. The first or<br>
the second metallic contact can be connected with the back side of the second solar cell and<br>
the third metallic contact can be connected to the first solar cell. Also, the protective diode is<br>
connected through the first or second metallic contact anti-parallel to the first solar cell<br>
through the second solar cell.<br>
A solar cell array is suggested that comprises of a discrete of protective diode, which with<br>
respect to the front-side region is structured in such a way that apart from the n/p-or p/n-<br><br>
6<br>
junction of the protective diode a direct ohm contact is generated between the second metallic<br>
contact and the substrate of the protective diode, in order to on the one hand allow an<br>
electrically conductive connection between solar cells and on the other hand to connect the<br>
protective diode anti-parallel to the solar cell to be protected.<br>
According to the invention, the task of protecting a solar cell in the string is largely fulfilled<br>
by an anti-parallel connected discrete diode made of a semiconductor body of first conducting<br>
type (substrate), in which on the front side beside the first metallic contact on a semiconductor<br>
region of second conductivity type and at a distance from it on the semiconductor of the first<br>
conductivity type electrically separated by the p/n-junction a second metallic contact is<br>
foreseen that is electrically connected directly to the substrate. Depending on the type of solar<br>
cell and choice of conductivity type of the substrate of the diode, the back side of the solar<br>
cell to be protected can be electrically connected to the diode through the first or second<br>
contact by means of connectors, and to the second respective first metallic contact of the<br>
diode the back side of the cell to be protected is connected in the string directly to the<br>
subsequent cell, which on its part by means of the connector is electrically connected to the<br>
string for serial switching of the solar cells with the front side of the previous cell to be<br>
protected, whereby the diode in the group/bonding forms a protective diode arranged anti-<br>
parallel to the solar cells to be protected.<br>
In an extension it is foreseen that the first and second solar cell are connected through at least<br>
two protective diodes and a third metallic contact of one of the first protective diode is<br>
connected to the back contact of the second solar cell as well as to the second metallic contact<br>
of the second protective diode whose third metallic contact is connected to the front contact of<br>
the first solar cell. One thus obtains a simple connection of the solar cell among one another<br>
and at the same time connection of the protective diodes to the solar cell to be protected.<br>
On connecting to solar cells through two protective diodes one of the protective diodes can be<br>
resigned in such a way that the second metallic contact is connected to the first metallic<br>
contact and the surface region of second conductivity stretches below the first and the second<br>
metallic contact.<br>
In order to enable a simple connection of the connectors going out from the first and second<br>
protective diode and connecting these to one another, according to a further suggestion of the<br><br>
7<br>
invention it is foreseen that a connector going out from the second metallic contact of the first<br>
protective diode along with a connector going out from the second metallic contact of the<br>
second protective diode protrudes above the front side of the first and second solar cell or<br>
their cover glasses and are joined outside the cover glasses preferably by welding or<br>
soldering.<br>
Irrespective of whether the solar cells are connected through one or more protective diodes a<br>
suggestion of the invention foresees that the first solar cell and/or the second solar cell in top<br>
view has a rectangular shape with sloping corners and the at least one protective diode runs in<br>
the region of one of the sloping corners. In this way one obtains an optimum utilisation of the<br>
panel surface, whereby simultaneously a simple switching/connection of protective diodes<br>
and solar cells is possible.<br>
It is particularly foreseen that several solar cells connected into a string are connected through<br>
corresponding protective diodes. In each sloping corner one protective diode can be arranged.<br>
Protective diodes and solar cells lie in this case in one plane.<br>
According to the invention it is suggested that the protective diode has a triangular geometric<br>
shape in top view.<br>
It is particularly foreseen that the protective diode has the geometrical shape of a triangular<br>
column.<br>
In a solar cell with quadratic surface with bevelled corners and an edge position of 8 cm,<br>
before the corners are removed the protective diode should have a basic face F of preferably<br>
approximately 0.7 cm2≤F ≤ 1 cm2, particularly approximately 0.8 cm2≤F ≤ 0.9 cm2.<br>
The invention further pertains to a method for switching/connecting a solar cell string that is<br>
characterised by the following process steps:<br>
-	Arrangement of the solar cells with the backside on a base support;<br>
-	Connection of front side contacts of the solar cells with first connectors;<br>
-	Fixing of one or more transparent covers on the front side of the solar cells;<br>
-	Turning of the solar cells;<br>
-	Connecting the first and second solar cells to a string through the first connectors;<br><br>
8<br>
-	Fixing of protective diodes in the free spaces between the solar cells;<br>
-	Connecting the protective diodes with the solar cells; and<br>
-	Connecting the thus created string to a base support.<br>
Before fixing the protective diodes adjacent solar cells are connected in series through the<br>
first connectors.<br>
In an extension it is foreseen that protective diodes are arranged with their backside contacts,<br>
i.e. third metallic contacts in the front side region of the solar cells and adjacent solar cells are<br>
connected in series through respectively one protective diode with simultaneous anti-parallel<br>
connection of the protective diode to one of the adjacent solar cells.<br>
The following process steps are foreseen:<br>
a)	Arrangement of the solar cells with the backside on a base support;<br>
b)	Fixing of protective diodes in the free spaces between the diodes;<br>
c)	Connecting front side contacts of the solar cells to the second contacts (backside<br>
contacts) of the protective diodes running front-sided in the string;<br>
d)	Fixing of one or more transparent covers on the front sides of the solar cells;<br>
e)	Turning the solar cells;<br>
f)	Connecting the first and third contacts (front contacts) of the protective diodes running<br>
back-sided in the string with back-sided contacts of adjacent solar cells; and<br>
g)	Connecting the thus created strings to a support base.<br>
The string can be turned before connecting to the base support.<br>
The invention further foresees that two protective diodes are arranged between two adjacent<br>
solar cells, out of which one protective diode with its backside contact (third metallic contact)<br>
and the other protective diode with its front side contact (first and second metallic contact) are<br>
arranged in the front side region of the solar cells. The adjacent solar cells are connected in<br>
series through the two protective diodes and the protective diodes are connected/switched<br>
through contacts running in the region of the backsides of the solar cells. Second connectors<br>
that are connected outside the solar cell strings can go out from contacts of the protective<br>
diodes running in the region of the backsides of the solar cells.<br><br>
9<br>
The invention also suggests a diode with a substrate made of semiconductor material of a first<br>
conductivity, a layer formed in the surface region of the substrate or a layer of second<br>
conductivity applied on the surface region, a first metallic contact on the layer of second<br>
conductivity and a second metallic contact near the first metallic contact at a distance from it<br>
and electrically insulated and connected through a p/n-junction, which is directly contacted<br>
with the substrate of the protective diode, for using as protective diode in a solar cell array.<br>
The p/n-junction in the protective diode can be replaced by a Schottky contact.<br>

On the basis of design examples given in the figures the shape of discrete protective diodes<br>
for solar cells and their integration into a solar cell string or panel is described in more details<br>
below. Same elements are denoted by same reference signs or corresponding reference signs.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a protective diode 101 as per the invention in a first design form, which is made<br>
of a semiconductor material like silicon, germanium or a material from the IIIrd and Vth group<br>
of the period system like GaS or GaP or GalnAs or GalnP. The main body, i.e. the substrate<br>
11 can be doped p-conductive. In a surface region, namely in the region of the front side of<br>
the protective diode 101a n-doped region 12 is designed up to the surface, which along with<br>
the substrate 11 forms a good backward blocking n-/p-junction (n-up-diode), that is the actual<br>
protective diode.<br>
As indicated clearly in the depiction in fig. 1, the n-doped region stretches only over a portion<br>
of the top side of the substrate 11. The n-doped region is covered in the outside by a metallic<br>
contact 13. This is designated as first contact. Along the backside stretches an electrically<br>
conductive contact 15 with the conductivity of the substrate 11 and is in ohm contact with it.<br>
This contact is designated as third contact. At a distance to the first contact 13 an electrically<br>
insulated from it a further metallic contact 14 is applied on the top side of the substrate 11, i.e.<br>
outside the n-doped region 12; this contact has an ohm contact with the substrate 11. This<br>
contact is designated as second contact. Through the electrically conductive first and second<br>
contacts 13, 14 on the front side of the protective diode 101 and the back contact 15 (third<br>
contact) solar cells are connected in the manner described below.<br>
A further protective diode 102 can be seen in fig. 2. Here the n-doped surface region 12<br>
stretches mostly along the entire top side. The n-doped region 12 is then covered by the first<br>
metallic contact 13. Otherwise the protective diode 102 structure-wise corresponds to the<br>
protective diode 101.<br><br>
11<br>
In practice, for improving the properties of the protective diodes 101, 102 insulation layers<br>
and/or passivasion and/or metallization can be applied on the semiconductor or the<br>
semiconductor layers 11, 12 or even on parts of the metallic contacts 13, 14, 15.<br>
The dimensioning protective diodes 101, 102 is ideally selected in such a way that these are<br>
arranged in a string in regions that are not covered by solar cells, that are preferably designed<br>
as cropped corner cells, i.e. solar cells with bevelled or cropped corners. The protective<br>
diodes 101, 102 should be arranged in the distant corners of the solar cells particularly in the<br>
region of solar cells partitioned from one another, in order to connect/switch the solar cells in<br>
the manner described below.<br>
Instead of protective diodes 101, 102 with n/p-junction, as n-up-diodes, even protective<br>
diodes with crossed doping can be used for corresponding doped solar cells. In this case the<br>
doping is crossed, i.e. p - n and n - p.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a further design form of a protective diode 20 as per the invention that in<br>
principle corresponds to the protective diode 101. Area wise, in the protective diode 20 the<br>
p/n-junction can first be produced on one side of the surface covering the entire area. As<br>
example, one can mention diffusion or ion-implantation of a suitable doping substance or<br>
epitactic separation of layers and subsequent removal (etching out) of a portion of the doped<br>
region 22 opposite to the substrate 21. The protective diode 20 shown in fig. 3 is one such<br>
diode of the type p-up, where a metallic contact 23 is applied on the p-conducting layer 22 as<br>
the first contact. At a distance from it and electrically insulated from it an ohm contact to the<br>
n-conducting substrate 21, the second metallic 24 is arranged. Along the back side of the<br>
substrate 21 stretches the third metallic contact 25 or back contact.<br>
On the basis of the protective diode 20 it should be clear that protective diodes of the above<br>
described type, i.e. protective diodes 101, 102 and 20, particularly those shown in fig. 1 and<br>
fig. 3 can be advantageously used in various applications. For this, the electrical circuit<br>
(StKr) including possible terminal points K1, K2, K3, K4 and the elements electrically active<br>
in the interior are shown, i.e. the diodes (P (p-up)), the resistances R1 and R3 that run<br>
between the terminals K1 and K2 or K4 and K3, as well as the resistance R4, which in the<br>
design example runs horizontally through the n-conducting substrate 21, and the resistance R2<br>
that prevails in the backside contact 25 (third contact).<br><br>
12<br>
A rough estimation of the maximum voltage loss ∆V in the diode 20 in addition to the voltage<br>
drop at the p/n-junction on account of the voltage loss in the inner resistances R1 to R4 for an<br>
assumed current of I = J A can be calculated from ∆V = R . I with R = [(R1+R2+R3). R4]/[<br>
R1+R2+R3+R4]. The estimation was conducted in such a way that the calculation resistance<br>
are always greater than they would actually be in reality and the voltage loss would<br>
accordingly be lesser in reality.<br>
As calculation example one can take a diode that corresponds to the diode 101 and is<br>
produced from 20 mΩcm Si-substrate (p1 = 2E-2Ωcm). The shape corresponds to that in fig.<br>
6, the surface of the diode 101 is F1 = 1 cm2, p-(14) and n-(13) region is respectively Fn = Fp<br>
= 0.5 cm2, where the double face of the diode bottom side is not taken into account. The<br>
thickness of the diode 101 is D1 = 150 urn = 0.015 cm, the length of the separating edge B1<br>
between the contacts 13 and 14 is B1 = 1.2 cm, its distance S1 is S1 = 100 µm (0.01 cm), the<br>
thickness B2 of metallization (p2 = 1.6E-6Ωcm) from Ag: B2 = 10 µm (0.001 cm), the<br>
distance A1 between the connectors 40a and 40b is A1 = 0.5 cm.<br>
The estimation is done with the help of the formula for calculation of resistances from specific<br>
resistance p and external geometry of the resistance, that is length L and cross section F : R =<br>
p . length L/cross section F.<br>
For R1 and R3 (vertical resistance in the substrate 21) the following estimation is valid:<br>
p1 = 2E-2Ωcm silicon<br>
for both R1 and R2 we have: area F = Fp (14) = Fn (13 = 0.5 cm2,<br>
length L = D1 =0.015 cm<br>
R1=R3 = 1.5E-4Ω<br>
For R2 in contact metal made of Ag: thickness D2 = 10 µm (0.001 cm), p = 1.6 E-6 Ωcm<br>
F can be calculated from F = D2 . B1 = 0.0006 cm . 1.2 cm = 7.2 E-4 cm2,<br>
Length L = Al = 0.5 cm<br>
R2 = 6.6 E-4Ω<br>
For R4 (horizontal resistance in the substrate): pl= 2E-2Ωcm silicon<br>
F determines itself from the thickness Dl and Bl to F = Dl . Bl = 1.2 cm,<br>
Length L = A1 =0.01 cm<br>
R4=1.1E-2Ω<br><br>
13<br>
The voltage loss AV = R . 1:<br>
∆V = [(R1+R2+R3)*R4]/[ R1+R2+R3+R4]*<br>
∆V = 0.88 E-3V = 0.88 mV.<br>
In practice, this voltage drop can be made even lesser.<br>
As in the case of application of a silicon diode the voltage drop at the p/n-junction is approx.<br>
0.68 V (680 mV), therefore the voltage drop on the inner resistances of the protective diode<br>
make only a very small additional contribution.<br>
On the basis of the following explanations the use of protective diodes as per the invention is<br>
explained in more details under consideration of standard connecting techniques of solar cells.<br>
The design of a solar cell 30 favoured now a days with cropped corners 32 made of III-V-<br>
material and on the base of an epitaxy wafer of 31 to 100 mm diameter is schematically<br>
shown in fig. 4 from the light incidence side. The metal current collecting bars 33 with the<br>
contact faces 34 for fixing the electrical serial connections (connectors) between the cells 30<br>
in the string lie on the shorter side of both longer sides limited by both cropped corners 32<br>
that immediately bordered against the cells connected serially in the string. For almost<br>
optimum utilization of the wafer face the edge lengths a, b, c of the cell 30 are for example<br>
a = 8 cm, b = 4 cm and c = 1.35 cm.<br>
In this case, on the string plane at an angle of 45° between the edges b and c there remains a<br>
triangular face not used for converting light with edges of lengths Ld = approx. 0.95 cm/0.95<br>
cm/1.35 cm, i.e. a face of Fd = approx. 0.9 cm2.<br>
Fig. 5 shows in cross-section and in cut-out purely schematically a possible connecting type<br>
from cell to cell and cell to diode, whereby the last mentioned corresponds to the type shown<br>
in fig. 2. For the sake of clarity the current flow diagram has also been drawn in and is<br>
marked with 4b7.<br>
The solar cells 30a 30b are once of the triple type, where for example on a germanium<br>
substrate a Ge bottom cell and on it a GalnAs centre cell and finally a GaInP top cell are<br>
applied which are separated by tunnel diodes. To this extent however, reference is made to<br><br>
14<br>
known solar cell types. The solar cells themselves are fixed by a sticker 4b6 on a base 4b5.<br>
On the light incidence side the solar cells 30a, 30b and hence also the protective diodes 102<br>
are covered over a sticker 4b3a, 4b3b by means of a cover glass 4b2a, 4b2b.<br>
In the design example the topmost semiconductor layer of the cells 30a, 30b is n-conducting<br>
(n-up-cells) without any restriction to the principle of the invention.<br>
In a usual production method of strings for panels that exercise the function of the carrier 4b5,<br>
first the connectors 4bl are fixed on the light incidence side (front side) of the solar cells 30a,<br>
30b to the front side contact faces 34. Then the cover glass 4b2a is fixed with the help of a<br>
sticker 4b3a. In this condition the solar cell is also denoted as CIC (connector integrated cell)<br>
or SCA (solar cell assembly). The solar cells are then turned around for connecting into a<br>
string, so that the backside lies on top. Then the connectors 4b1 are electrically connected to<br>
the back side of the bordering cell by welding or shouldering, in the design example the<br>
neighbouring cell 30b.<br>
At this point of time fixing of a diode 102 as per the invention takes shape very easily, i.e. in<br>
the design example a n-up-diode for a n-up-solar cell 30a in a cropped corner of the cell 30a -<br>
or in each cropped corner a corresponding diode 102 as per the invention - of the same type,<br>
however mirror-symmetric in design. Thus on the p-conducting type, i.e. in the shown case<br>
of the n-up-diode on the metallic contact 15, the p-contact, a connector 40b corresponding to<br>
the connector 4b1 is fixed and a second connector 40a is fixed on the metallic contact 13<br>
covering the n-conducting region 12, the diode 102 is inserted in one of the cropped corners in<br>
order to create electrically conducting connections on the one hand between the back side of<br>
the cell 30b and the metallic contact 15 of the protective diode 102 and, on the other hand,<br>
between the contact 13 and the back contact of the solar cell 30a through the connector 40a<br>
(see current diagram 4b7). On using a p-up-diode the contact 13 and 15 can be switched. The<br>
diode 102 can similarly be provided with a sticker 4b3b with a cover glass 4b2b, or the cover<br>
glass 4b2a of the cell 30a is designed so big that the diode 102 can be directly pasted in an<br>
electrically connected in the above described method.<br>
The further sequence of panel creation by applying the string with the help of a sticker 4b6 on<br>
the base 4b5 is not tangibly influenced by installing the protective diode 102.<br><br>
15<br>
For a p-up-cell with principally the same design as in fig. 5, for example, a diode 102 with<br>
corresponding opposite doping can be used in the same manner.<br>
The use of the diode 101 (fig. 1) can be made even simpler as fixing of connectors on the<br>
diode 101 before introducing into the string array is not necessary, as one can see from fig. 6.<br>
Fig. 6 shows purely schematically a cross-section through a possible connecting method of<br>
cell 30a to cell 30b and the cells 30a, 30b with the protective diode 101. Here too the current<br>
flow diagram 4b7 has been drawn in for the sake of clarity. Instead of the diode 101 as shown<br>
in fig. 1 also a diode 20 shown in fig. 3 can be installed without deviating from the principle<br>
of the invention. The same holds good for the other design examples.<br>
The solar cells 30a, 30b are once like those describe in the context of fig. 5, so that reference<br>
can be made to the concern designs. Consequently these are, without any restriction to the<br>
invention, solar cells 30a, 30b of the type n-up. In the standard production process of string<br>
for panels first the connectors 4bl are fixed on the light incidence side of the solar cells 30a,<br>
30b to the front contact 34, then the cover glass 4b2a is fixed with the help of the sticker 4b3,<br>
the corresponding solar cells 30a, 30b called CICs are turned around for connecting into a<br>
string, so that the back side shows upwards, so that then the connectors 4b1 can be electrically<br>
connected to the respective neighbouring cell by welding or shouldering, that is in the design<br>
example with the cell 30b.<br>
Simultaneously - as already explained - the protective diode 101 is installed which<br>
corresponding to the n-up-cell is a n-up-diode and connected anti-parallel. Fixing the<br>
protective diode 101 takes place in one of the cropped corners of the cell 30a. If required, a<br>
corresponding protective diode can be fixed in each cropped corner, whereby the design is<br>
mirror-symmetric. Fixing is even simpler as compared to the shape in fig. 5, as after inserting<br>
the diode 101 into the array of the cells 30a, 30b lying beside one another only the connectors<br>
40a and 40b between the metallic layer stretching along the n-doped layer 12 or the first<br>
metallic contact 13 with the back side of the solar cell 30a and the electrically conducting<br>
second contact 14 running directly on the p-conducting substrate 11 with the back side of the<br>
solar cell 30b has to be connected like between the cells. Here too the diode 101 can be<br>
provided with the cover glass 4b2b through a sticker 4b3b or the cover glass of the cell 4b2a<br><br>
16<br>
is designed large enough to directly paste the diode 101 and electrically connected in this<br>
manner.<br>
The further process sequence of panel creation as well as fixing of the string with the help of<br>
another sticker 4b6 on the base is not effective by the installation of the diode 101.<br>
The above described process with the significance processed step is shown once again purely<br>
as a principle in fig. 15.<br>
For a p-up-cell with principally the same design as shown in fig. 6, a diode corresponding in<br>
one in fig. 1 can be used with the limitation that the substrate is n-conducting and the doped<br>
surface layer is p-conducting.<br>
There is further the possibility of connecting the protective diode 101 between the first solar<br>
cell 30a and the second solar cell 30b in such a way that the first contact 13 is connected with<br>
the back side contact of the second solar cell 30b and the second contact 14 is connected with<br>
the back side of the first solar cell 30a. For corresponding connection the p-/n-junction must<br>
be accordingly re-doped.<br>
Fig. 7 shows in cut-out two part views of a string of cells 30a, 30b with protective diodes 101,<br>
viewed from the back side, which are connected to a string. The cell strings are different to<br>
the extent that the designs of the connections between the protective diode 101 and the solar<br>
cells 30a or solar cells 30b vary from one another.<br>
Fig. 8 gives a preferred extension and utilization of the protective diodes as per the invention,<br>
which is not only connected anti-parallel to a solar cell but also at the same time serves as a<br>
part of the connection between cells bordering one another. The simplified panel production<br>
can be obtained from the fig. 8 to 10 and 16, whereby similarly - without any general<br>
limitation - the solar cells 50a, 50b to be connected are of the type n-up-cell. Here too<br>
protective diode 101 or 20 - ideally in mirror-symmetric design - are used for connecting<br>
successive solar cells 50a, 50b, as one can directly see from fig. 9 and 10. A protective diode<br>
101 is respectively electrically connected in a bevelled corner of the solar cell 50a before<br>
fixing the common cover glass 5a2 with the help of a sticker 5al by a connector 5a3 in such a<br>
way, that the front side of the cell 50a is connected with the bottom side of the diode 101, i.e.<br><br>
17<br>
the third contact 15 or 25 as shown in fig. 1, running along the front side of the solar cells<br>
50a, 50b to be connected to the string. For this, in the design of the cell 50a contact faces 5a<br>
are designed on the edge region of the cropped corner that are connected to the current<br>
collecting bars 5a7. The solar cell 50a with protective diode 101 or 20 is then connected by<br>
fixing a connector 40a between the second metallic contact 14 or 24 directly contacted with<br>
the substrate 11 of the protective diode 101 or 20 and back side of the cell 50b and by fixing a<br>
connector 40b between the first electrically conducting contact 13 or 23 arranged on the p-<br>
doped layer 12 and the back side of the solar cell 50a and integrated in the string. Further<br>
fixing on the panel corresponds to the already given explanations.<br>
Fig. 8 is the current diagram 5a4 with the relevant diode and resistances.<br>
The connector 40b - as one can see from the process sequence in fig. 16 - can also be fixed<br>
before fixing the common cover glass 5a2 between the back side of the cell 50a and the<br>
contact 13 of the diode 101.<br>
In Fig. 16 one can purely see the principle of the process sequence for connecting the<br>
protective diode 101 - and correspondingly the protective diode 20 - with the solar cells 50a,<br>
50b or anti-parallel to the solar cell 50a. Thus the protective diodes 101 are first arranged in<br>
the "free" corners of the solar cells 50a, 50b and the front contacts of the first solar cells 50a<br>
and the second solar cells 50b are respectively connected with the third contacts of protective<br>
diodes 101, generally referred to as back contact. A separate protective diode 101 is allocated<br>
to each first and second solar cell 50a, 50b. For this a first connector 5a3 is used. The<br>
connector 40b can also be already fitted at this point of time. Then a cover glass 5a2 is pasted<br>
respectively on a solar cell with this connected protective diode, the created units are turned<br>
around and then - if it has not happened partially already - the first and second contacts 13,<br>
14 of protective diodes 101 are connected or welded with first and second solar cells in order<br>
to connect the solar cells serially to a string while simultaneously integrating the protective<br>
diodes. After turning the thus created string it is pasted on a panel in the usual manner.<br>
An estimation of the additional voltage drop between the cells 50a and 50b on account of<br>
using the protective diode in the manner shown as example can be obtained for this example<br>
again from Fig. 3. Here the current flows from terminal point K2 to K4. The current will flow<br><br>
18<br>
through serial resistances R2 + R3 (the resistances R3 + R4 lie parallel and at best reduce the<br>
total resistance), the voltage drop for current flow I = IA will therefore be maximum<br>
∆V = (R2+R3) .1 = (6.6E-4 +1.5E-4). IA = 8.1E-4 V = 0.81 mV<br>
and will be lower in practice.<br>
The tendency towards larger solar cells makes the introduction of solar cells with the main<br>
axes of approx 8 cm . 8cm always more probable. Then one cell is produced per 4-inch-wafer,<br>
so that the reduction in total complication becomes particularly significant and hence use of<br>
discrete protective diodes that are easy to integrate becomes important.<br>
Fig. 11 shows a possible design of such a solar cell 60 with altogether 4 cropped corners 62.<br>
Corresponding solar cells 60 can be connected according to the procedure already explained<br>
with one or two protective diodes of suitable design with neighbouring cells.<br>
With the help of a special design of a solar cell 70 as shown in Fig. 12, in which the current<br>
collecting bar 73 is connected electrically conductive with all four contact faces 7 laid in the<br>
region of the fringes or edges of the cropped corners 76, four diodes l0al, 10a2, l0bl, 10b2<br>
can protect the cell 70 and the connection to the previous cell 70a - following cell 70b - can<br>
take place according to the explanations in the context of Fig. 8 only along the backside. This<br>
results in an inner connection of all cells with the protective diodes as per the invention and<br>
outer connections among one another with the protective diodes as per the invention. Thus<br>
Fig. 13 shows purely in principle a cross-section through a panel with cells 70 that<br>
respectively have four cropped corners. The connection of the cells among one another takes<br>
place through so called outer connectors 711 on the backside of the SCA 75 (SCA = solar cell<br>
assembly = solar cell 70 and connected diode l0al, 10a2, l0bl, 10b2 on the front side (light<br>
incidence side) provided with a common cover glass 77 by means of the sticker 78) with the<br>
help of the protective diodes l0al, 10a2, l0bl, 10b2 that are connected by so called inner<br>
connectors 76 (within the SCAs) to the cell.<br>
As diodes l0bl and 10b2 one can use the diodes as shown in Fig. 2 as well as protective<br>
diodes of opposite conductivity corresponding to those in Fig. 1 and 3, as the second contact<br>
14 of the diode according to Fig. 1 is not required for attaching a connector and the face of the<br>
first contact 13 can take up the entire surface of the front side for reducing the electrical<br>
resistance in the diode.<br><br>
19<br>
A variant of the outer connector is schematically shown in Fig. 14. As there is no danger of<br>
short circuit on the sides of the diodes l0al and those adjacent to it with opposite conductivity<br>
of the type as shown in Fig. 1 and 2, one half of the outer connector can be guided over the<br>
side of the cover glass 77 onto the front side of the CIC in order to establish an electrical<br>
connection by welding or soldering (see arrow). The advantage of this technology lies in the<br>
fact that till shortly before the final production of the panel the SCA can be measured and in<br>
case of defects a repair can be carried out relatively easily, e.g. replacement of a SCA. Such a<br>
connector also offers the possibility of connecting the front side of the cover glass 77 against<br>
electrostatic charging with the cell.<br>
One can see especially from Fig. 7, 9, 10 and 12 that the protective diodes 20, 101 in top view<br>
have a triangular geometrical shape, preferably a shape with right angle and equally long<br>
arms/shanks. Other geometrical shapes are similarly possible. Irrespective of that the<br>
protective diodes fill up the free spaces between the solar cells created by the cropped corners.<br><br>

The invention relates to a solar cell<br>
assembly comprising at least one first solar cell and<br>
at least one discrete protective diode (101) that is<br>
connected to the solar cell. The aim of the invention<br>
is to comprehensively protect a solar cell, a solar<br>
cell composite or a string of cells by means of one<br>
or more protective diodes, without resorting to the<br>
use of the material of the solar cells. To achieve this,<br>
in addition to a front and a rear contact (13, 15),<br>
the protective diode comprises an additional contact<br>
(14) that is placed at a distance from the front<br>
contact and is electrically connected to said contact<br>
via a p/n junction. A connector leads from the<br>
additional contact to a second solar cell, the latter in<br>
turn being connected to the first solar cell in a string.</td>
