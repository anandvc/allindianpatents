				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention in general relates to 3rd generation mobile communication system. Specifically this invention relates to value added network based services in mobile telephony. More particularly, this invention relates to a method of remote call diverting in mobile phone.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
In the current scenario when a user forgets to carry his mobile, he misses all his incoming calls. There is no system as such by which the user can attend the incoming calls if mobile is not with him. A user can attend the calls if he diverts the calls to the number in which he is available. Currently if a user wishes to divert a call he should have mobile with him. Again to change the diverted number he needs to have mobile with him. Currently user either has to call a specified number from his mobile with special key code(MMI code) and the number to which call is to be diverted or he has to set the call divert using a menu by giving number to which call is to be diverted. In either of these cases a request from Mobile to Network goes to enable or disable call divert by making call from his mobile. But if Mobile is not with user, he can not make this request for enabling or disabling of call divert. This invention provides a method by which user can initiate call forwarding process by sending special SMS message through external Web Applications or other mobile, on receipt of which, Mobile will initiate call diverting to the number provided by the user in special SMS message (on its own).<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary objective of the present invention is to invent a method where user will be able to divert the calls from remote web application (or some other mobile) by sending SMS message (from the existing number to the new number required to divert the calls).<br>
It is another object of this invention where in addition to the above mentioned applications, user will be able to access other applications such as call barring.<br>
This invention provides a method in which a user will still be able to attend calls coming to his mobile even though he is not carrying his mobile by diverting calls coming to his mobile to another number, in which user will be available. This number can be near by number or known mobile or PSTN number. This invention makes it possible to enable and disable the diverting of calls of a particular mobile from remote places from where the user can send SMS message to his mobile.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method of remote call diverting in mobile phone comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	requesting remote call diverting by sending SMS to UE from a remote Web application by the user;<br>
(b)	sending SMS message asking for user name in response by UE ;<br>
(c)	inputting the user name by the user;<br><br>
(d)	performing the first level of authentication by the user;<br>
(e)	performing a second level of authentication by the user;<br>
(f)	initiating call diverting feature between UE and network if authentication is successful; and<br>
(g)	sending the success or failure result to the UE .<br>
The call diverting number is incorporated in the initial request by the user. While performing the first level of authentication UE sends SMS message asking for password and gets the password from the user. UE authenticates the user by comparing the name and password which are already stored in the UE. On successful completion of the first level of authentication UE starts the second level of authentication by asking predefined questions, if defined. The user responds to the questions where the number of questions depends on the security level stored in the UE side. On successful completion of second authentication procedure UE starts the procedure to change the call diverting number which is incorporated in the initial request Call diverting is done between UE and network and the reply which indicates whether call has been diverted successfully or not along with the reason is sent to the user. An additional module in SMS application is used to check for special SMS messages for various call forwarding methods. The additional module is used in SMS application layer to initiate user authentication by sending questions in SMS messages to user and comparing the answers provided by user to the answers stored in the mobile by user. The additional module is used in the SMS application to send request to a SS application for enabling or disabling call divert. The additional module is used in SS application to indicate back to SMS application<br><br>
about the result of the Call divert registration or de-registration status with Network. The additional module is used to wait for result of call divert registration or de-registration with network from SS application. The additional module is used to inform user about the call divert result by sending SMS message.<br>
The other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS Figure 1 shows the steps involved in the invention.<br>
Figure 2 explains the basic architecture of UE along with the intended application.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the<br><br>
claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Invention constitutes changes in the Mobile application software. No changes are needed in the network except that it should support web applications like yahoo, MSN etc. User can make use of this invention through the web applications which are supported by the, network. In addition to this, these web applications should support the functionality to send SMS messages to mobiles.<br>
Generally Enabling or Disabling of Call Divert is made by a registering or deregistering this service with network. There is a protocol entity named SS [supplementary Services], a part of UMTS Non-Access Stratum Protocol, which initiates this registration of call diverting with network on user's request. The present invention provides a method where a user can make this request for call divert even when mobile is not with him. User is making this request by sending special SMS message to Mobile. SMS protocol layer in Mobile delivers this SMS message to SMS application in Mobile. SMS application in mobile checks if it is the special SMS message intended for call diverting. On getting special SMS message, SMS application tries to authenticate the user so that only the genuine user will be able to activate or deactivate call diverting. On successful authentication, SMS application in Mobile sends request to SS application to enable call diverting. SS application sends this request to SS protocol in mobile which tries to register call diverting with network. If user wishes to restore call divert back to mobile, he needs to send<br><br>
different special SMS message to mobile. In this case again the same procedure is repeated in mobile and call divert is deregistered with network. There are many ways in which Special Messages can be chosen. Special Message can be like a) CALL FORWARD 25550555 b) CALL FORWARD RESTORE c) CALL FRWRD 25550555 d) CALL FRWRD RSTR...<br>
Following changes are needed to realize remote call diverting.<br>
•	Providing user interface for entering questions and answers to be stored in Phone Memory<br>
•	Parsing SMS messages to identify remote call forwarding request and initiating user authentication on getting remote call forwarding request<br>
•	Initiating supplementary services call forwarding procedure on successful user authentication<br>
•	Indicating user the result of the call forwarding procedure<br>
User sets the questions and gives answers to these questions which are stored in the Mobile Memory, which can be accessed by Mobile user only on entering security password. Once a user has entered set of questions and answers, Mobile is ready for remote call diverting operation.<br>
User will send an SMS using a web application like yahoo, MSN etc. to Mobile Phone to control the activation and deactivation of call diverting. Activation and deactivation of call divert will be initiated in Mobile Phone on authenticating user by<br><br>
way of asking set of questions for which user has to answer using SMS message. On successful authentication Mobile will initiate activation or deactivation of call forwarding procedure with mobile network. User will be notified back by SMS message on successful completion of activation or deactivation of call divert. This procedure will be repeated if user wants to activate or deactivate call divert to some other number.<br>
This feature can be implemented using a special SMS class, so that the overheads can be avoided. If we use ordinary SMS - class each and every message has to be parsed. If it is an ordinary SMS-class, it will be stored in the SIM. But in this case this becomes overhead for the user and performance will be decreased.<br>
1<br>
Current Web Applications support sending Class 2 SMS message which is charged and is also stored in USIM. If Web Applications supports controlling SMS message class with network support then user can send Class 0 SMS message which will not be charged. Also processing in UE also reduces as we know that request for Call Forwarding will arrive only in Class 0 Message and it will check for call forwarding request only in SMS Class 0 Message.<br>
Whenever SMS comes with our predefined class (specific to our application), SMS module will send this raw message to the function which will initiate the process of Remote Call Diverting. This function will be on top of the SMS module and whenever it gets the request from remote application it will be initiated. Once it is initiated it will be an automated process only.<br><br>
Referring to figure 1 there are following steps involved:<br>
•	User requests remote call diverting by sending SMS to UE from a remote Web application<br>
•	In response UE will send SMS message asking for user name and gets the user name from the user<br>
•	In successful case UE will send SMS message asking for password and gets the password<br>
•	UE authenticates the user by comparing the name and password which are already stored in the UE<br>
•	On successful completion of the first level of authentication UE will start the second level of authentication by asking the predefined questions, if defined.<br>
•	User has to respond to the questions accordingly.<br>
•	Number of questions depends on the security level stored in the UE side.<br>
•	On successful completion of second authentication procedure UE start the procedure to change the call diverting number which is incorporated in the initial request (CALL-DIVERT 9448252304)<br>
•	This procedure will be done between UE and network and the reply will be sent to the user.<br>
•	This reply indicates whether call has been diverted successfully or not along with the reason.<br>
Note: - UE can send reply at any time during this process (authentication failure)<br><br>
Figure 2 explains the basic architecture of UE along with the intended application. The steps involved in the intended application are there at the left side. When UE receives SMS for initiating remote call diverting feature this will invoke the function intended for diverting the call. This function consists of five steps.<br>
•	First level of authentication (user name and password)<br>
•	Second level of authentication (Question and answer session depends on the security level set by the user in UE)<br>
•	Initiating call diverting feature which happens between UE and network<br>
•	Sending the result to the UE (success or failure)<br>
Note: - At any time UE can send the failure message to application if the user can't provide reliable information<br>
This is achieved by putting additional application in the Mobile application. Additional Logics are to be added in Mobile application layers. These are:<br>
1.	Additional module in SMS application to check for special SMS messages for various call forwarding methods e.g. call forwarding, call forwarding restore, all conditional call forwarding messages etc.<br>
2.	Additional module in SMS application layer to initiate user authentication by sending questions in SMS messages to user and comparing the answers provided by user to the answers stored in the mobile by user.<br>
3.	Additional module in the SMS application to send request to SS application for enabling or disabling call divert.<br>
4.	Additional module in SS application to indicate back to SMS application<br><br>
about the result of the Call divert registration or de-registration status with<br>
Network<br>
5.<br>
Additional module in SMS application to wait for result of call divert<br>
registration or de-registration with network from SS application.<br>
6.<br>
Additional module in SMS application to inform user about the call divert<br>
result by sending SMS message<br>
Example:<br>
First way of implementation :-<br>
Web Application: Call Forward 25550555<br>
Mobile: User Id<br>
Web Application: Samsung<br>
Mobile: password<br>
Web Application: siso<br>
Mobile: Date of birth<br>
Web Application: January 7,1978<br>
Mobile: Forwarded 25550555 or failed <cause><br>
Second way of implementation: -<br>
Web Application: Call Forward 25550555 <user ld><password><br>
Mobile: Date of birth<br>
Web Application: January 7,1978<br>
Mobile: Forwarded 25550555 or failed <cause><br><br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
