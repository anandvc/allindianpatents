MULTIPLEXED SIGNALS<br><br>
BACKGROUND<br><br>
Field<br><br>
JMOIJ The present invention relates generally to communication systems and more specifically to decision feedback equalizers (DFFj for code decision multiplexed (CDM) signals<br><br>
Background<br><br>
|(M)02] Decision feedback filters (DFEs) are often used to improve reception of data by applying equalization to a wireless channel Based on demodulated data symbols, a filter is adjusted to counteract the effects of a wireless channel. A typical DFE for a single carrier signal includes a feed forward filter and a feedback filter that is based on the output of a symbol level demodulator. Unfortunately, conventional DFEs as applied to code division multiplexing systems result in chip level demodulation that is unreliable since the decisions do not take advantage of the CDM processing gain<br><br>
J0003J Therefore, there is a need for a DFE for CDM signals.<br><br>

|GG09j In the exemplary enibodi merit, a decision feedback equalizer (DFE) receives a code division multiplexed (CDM) signal that includes a plurality of code channels. The received signal is transmitted from a transmitter, such as a base station, through a wireless channel and received at the DFH within a portable device such as a wireless access terminal The wireless channel has scattering and multi-fading channel characteristics resulting in multiple versions of the signal arriving at the access terminal device at different times. The received signal is processed by a linear equalizer that at least partially compensates for the wireless channel characteristics before a data estimator despreads, descrambles, and demodulates the signal to recover estimated data symbols The estimated data symbols are modulated, scrambled, and spread by a signal re-constructor to generate an estimated transmitted signal. A channel estimate is applied to the estimated transmitted signal to generate an estimated received signal. After subtracting the estimated received signal from the received signal, the error signal is filtered by a filter that has a response partially based on the difference between the received signal and the error signal The resulting filtered signal is combined with the estimated transmitted signal The DFE 100 in the exemplary embodiment includes other functions and blocks that are omitted in FlG. 1 in the interest of brevity and clarity.<br><br>
{00! Gj The word "exemplar)'" is used herein to mean "serving as an example, instance, or illustration." Any embodiment described herein as "exemplary" is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments.<br><br>
JOOlIl FlG. I is a block diagram of a decision feedback equalizer (DFE) in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention The DFE 100 may be implemented in any combination of hardware, software and/or firmware. In the exemplary embodiment, the software code running on a processor within the access terminal executes the calculations, comparisons, and adjustments to perform the functions of the DFE 100. <br><br>
The various functions and operations of the blocks described with reference to the DFE 100 may be implemented in any number of devices, circuits, or elements. Two or more of the functional blocks may be integrated in a single device and the functions described as performed in any single device may be implemented over several devices in some circumstances. Depending on the particular implementation, the signals may be processed in the time domain or in the frequency domain as discussed below with reference to FlG 3.<br><br>
J00I2J A received signal 102 corresponding to a transmitted signal transmitted by a transmitter and through a wireless channel is received at the DFE 100 In the exemplary embodiment, the DFE 100 is implemented as part of a receiver within an access terminal such as CDMA handset, portable telephone, wireless personal digital assistant (PDA) or other wireless device. Accordingly, the received signal 102 may be received through antennas, low noise amplifiers (LNAs). and other hardware Depending on the implementation of the DFE iOO, the hardware may be considered as part of the wireless channel or may be treated as a separate mechanism acting on the signal.<br><br>
JOOlJl The received signal 102 is processed by a linear equalizer 104 that has a response based on a channel estimate of the wireless channel characteristics. The channel estimate may be obtained using any of numerous techniques. An example of suitable technique is discussed hi patent application serial number XX/XXX,XXX [ATTY DOCKET NO. 051212], filed March 21 , 2006, entitled "Communication Channel Estimation" and which, is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. The resulting initially equalized signal 106 is processed by a signal estimator 108 to generate an estimated transmitted signal 1 16 A data estimator 1 10 processes the equalized signal 106 to generate estimated data 114 which is processed by the signal reconstructor 112. The data estimator 1 10 despreads. descrambles and demodulates the initially equalized signal 106 to determine estimated data 1 14 of the transmitted data. Although in some circumstances a soft decision may be applied, a hard decision is applied to determine data symbols in the exemplary embodiment. The data estimator 1 10 processes all of the code channels within the received signal 102. Accordingly, if sixteen code channels are used for transmission within the wireless channel, sixteen sets of data are generated as an estimate In FlG I , arrow 114 is shown as a block arrow to illustrate that multiple data signals are generated by the data estimator 1 10. The data estimator, therefore, applies a plurality of pseudorandom codes to despread the coded channels and applies <br><br>
other signal processing such as descramb?ing before applying the appropriate demodulation such as quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)<br><br>
}OOI4| The signal reconsiructor i 12 generates the estimated transmitted signal 1 16 by processing the estimated data 1 14 using the same technique that is used by the transmitter to process the originally transmitted data. The signal reconstructor 1 12 includes a modulator, scrambler, and spreader in the exemplary- embodiment. The estimated data 1 14 is modulated using the originally used modulation scheme, scrambled using the originally used scrambling technique. The appropriate pseudorandom code is applied to the signal to generate the estimated transmi tted signal 1 16 The output of the signal estimator 108, therefore, is an estimate of the originally transmitted signal transmitted by the base station referred to as the estimated transmitted signal 1 16. Therefore, the estimated transmitted signal 1 16 is the transmitted signal before transmission through the wireless channel<br><br>
|0i)l5j A virtual wireless channel processor 1 18 such as a finite impulse response (I7IR) filter applies the channel estimate to the estimated transmitted signal 1 16 to generate the estimated received signal 120. If the initially equalized signal 106 does not contain excessive errors, such as significant residual multipath interference or receiver noise., then the estimated received signal 120 will be identical to the received signal 102. A combiner 122 generates an error signal 124 by subtracting the estimated received signal 120 from the received signal 102 A delay 126 provides the appropriate time processing to the received signal 102 in order synchronize the two signals 102, 120, before the subtraction function.<br><br>
|OO?6j The error signal 124 is processed by a filter 128 having a response based partially on the channel estimate and on a relationship between the received signal 102 and the estimated received signal 120. The filtered signal 130, therefore, is based on the power contained in the error signal 124, the channel estimate, and parameters based on the relationship between the received signal 102 and the estimated received signal 120. In the exemplary embodiment, the filter is a linear equalizer having a response based on the channel estimate, a noise estimate and a pulse shape and employs a minimum mean- square error (MMSE) function. An example of a suitable filter 128 is discussed in further detail with reference to FIG. 3 After filtering, the resulting filtered error signal is combined with the estimated transmitted signal 1 16. The combined signal is forwarded to signal processing such as despreading and demodulation. In the exemplary <br><br>
embodiment, the filter 128 has a response of the linear equalizer 104 further based on the relationship between the estimated received signal and the received signal.<br><br>
|00?7| A review of the following exemplary situations further reveals the operation of the DFE 100. Where the initially equalized signal 106 contains only small errors, the estimated transmitted signal 1 16 is identical to the transmitted signal. Applying the channel estimate results in an estimated received signal 120 that is the same as the received signal 102, except for the received noise, which is only contained in the received signal 102, and possibly channel estimation error, which is only contained in estimated received signal 120. If both the received noise and the channel estimation error are small, then the output of the combiner 122 is close to zero and the filtered signal 130 is also close to zero. Adding the estimated transmitted signal 1 16 to a signal close to zero results in a combined signal that accurately represents the transmitted signal<br><br>
{0T18J For a situation where the initially equalized signal 106 contains significant errors, the resulting estimated received signal 120 will have an error and the difference between the two signals is at least partially corrected by the filter 128. As result of significant errors contained in equalized signal 106, a symbol may be incorrectly determined to be, for example, a -H when the original symbol was transmitted as a -i . Hie incorrect symbol, with the other estimated data, is modulated, spread, and scrambled by the signal reconstructor to generate the estimated transmitted signal 1 16, After the channel estimate is applied, the resulting estimated received signal 120 reflects the inaccurate symbol estimate. When the estimated received signal 120 is subtracted from the received signal 102. the error signal 124 reflects the inaccuracy of the estimated transmitted signal 110. Since the filter response is partly based on a relationship between the received signal 102 and the estimated received signal 120, the resulting filtered signal 130 is an estimate of the error signal with the impact of the radio channel characteristics reduced.<br><br>
J00?91 A linear equalizer or any other suitable filter applied in the signal processing path has to operate based on a trade-off between minimizing the effect of the radio channel dispersion (i.e. multi-path propagation) and minimizing noise amplification A linear equalizer can be designed to achieve the best available trade-off between those two factors for the received signal 102. On the other hand, the filter 128 that operates on the error signal 124 as opposed to operating on the received signal itself can achieve an <br><br>
even better trade-off because the radio channel dispersion will have a reduced impact, in other than very low SNR conditions, due to the fact that the error signal 124 contains less power than the received signal 102.<br><br>
J0020J Therefore, the DFE SOO compensates for the channel characteristics by basing a linear equalizer (filter) 128 response on a relationship between the reconstructed estimated received signal and the received signal 102. In some situations, the error can be reduced by increasing the number of iterations through the filter and comparing a previous estimated received signal to current estimated received signal<br><br>
JT02IJ FJG 2 is block diagram of the exemplary DFE 100 where a second iteration is applied to the estimated received signal. After processing the received signal as described above, the combined signal from the combiner 132 is processed by the signal estimator 108 The signai is de&amp;pread. descrambled and demodulated to generate estimated data which is modulated, spread and scrambled to generate a second estimated transmitted signal 202. The channel estimate is applied to the second estimated transmitted signal 202 to determine a second estimated received signal 204. The second estimated received signal 204 is subtracted from the received signal 102 to generate a second error signal 206 that is filtered b&gt; the filter 208 having an adjusted response based on the relationship between the second estimated received signal 202 and the estimated received signal 120 t herefore the second filter 208 is the filter 128 with an adjusted response in the exemplary embodiment. The output of the second filter 208 is combined with the second estimated transmitted signal 202 before further processing in the receiver. Multiple iterations can be performed in a similar manner in some circumstances.<br><br>
|OO22} FIG. 3 is a block diagram of the exemplars' DFE 100 where processing is performed in the frequency domain. Accordingly, the received signal 102 is transformed from the time domain to the frequency in the exemplary DFE 100 discussed with reference to (7IG 3 As discussed above, the DFB 100 may be implemented in the time domain in some circumstances.<br><br>
}0023| A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) processor 302 transforms the received signal to the frequency domain yielding received signal spectrum 303 that is provided to the linear equalizer 104 and the combiner 122 in the exemplary DFE 100, the linear equalizer 104 has a response equal to Cc* X p* &gt; / (Ic!2 + n\ where c* is the complex conjugate of the channel estimate, p* is the complex conjugate of the spectrum of the <br><br>
pulse shape and p is the noise spectrum estimate The response of the linear equalizer 104 is dependent on frequency and therefore each of the parameters is a function of frequency Other iinear equalizers may be used in some circumstances. After the linear equalizer 104 processes the received signal spectrum 303 in the frequency domain, an inverse FFT (IFFT) processor 304 transforms the equalized signal to the time domain. The resulting signal is processed by a descrambler/despreader 306 to descramble and despread the signal. In some situations, the received signal is not scrambled and the descrambling function is not required. A quantizer 308 determines and sets the data values to the closest constellation value In the exemplary embodiment, the despread signal is demodulated by a demodulator 310 and a hard decision h applied in 312 to determine the best estimate of the constellation point represented by the data symbol. For example, where the modulation scheme is in accordance with !6-QAM ( 16 quadrature amplitude modulation), the phase and amplitude of the vector representing the symbol is estimated as applying to the closest constellation point of the 16 points and modulator 314 the hard decision to set the vector to the constellation point The spreader/ scrambler 316 applies the same spreading and scrambling schemes applied by the base station to generate the estimated transmitted signal 1 16. Therefore, the descrambler/despreader 306, the quantizer 308 and the spreader/scrambler 316 provide an exemplary technique for performing the functions of the signal estimator 108.<br><br>
|0024] The estimated transmitted signal 1 16 is transformed to the frequency domain by a FF T processor 318 before the channel estimate is applied. In some circumstances, a scaling processor 320 applies a scaling factor based on the estimated signal to noise ratio (SNR) before the estimated received signal 120 is subtracted from the received signal spectrum 303. As discussed below, the scaling factor minimizes or eliminates the contribution of the estimated received signal 120 when the signal to noise ratio is low<br><br>
}0025[ A coefficient generator 322 determines a coefficient S, that is applied to the linear equalizer to generate the filter 128. in the exemplary embodiment, S is equal to B\ p22 - O2 SzHl Pr -- n" K p2 is the power contained in error signal 124 averaged across the signal bandwidth at the output of the combiner 122, pi is the power contained in the received signal spectrum 303 averaged across the signal bandwidth and n is the estimated power of the noise averaged across the signal bandwidth. The filter response in the exemplary DFE 100 is equal to <br><br>
s x cr xp x<br><br>
S x C<br><br>
J0026] Therefore, when p; is equal to pi, S is equal to one and the response of the filter<br><br>
128 is the same as the response of the linear equalizer 104 In low SNR situations, when the estimated transmitted signal 1 16 is dominated by decision errors made by quantizer 308, E{p22 ¦ ¦ p"} is approximately equal to two times ••¦ tr}, which results in a maximum coefficient S equal to two In such low SNR situations, however, it is beneficial to de-weight the estimated received signal 120 since it does not cany useful information. An example of a suitable scaling factor is a factor equal to i~e? i ? S?R M applied in 320, where k l is constant and SNU est is an estimate of the signal to noise ratio. When used, the scaling factor provides a mechanism for minimizing or eliminating the effect of the estimated received signal on the received signal For example, if the SNR is sufficiently low, the estimated received signal is not applied to the combiner 122 and the received signal 102 is the same as the error signal, the coefficient S equals one and the filter response is the same as the linear equalizer response An example of another suitable solution to applying a scaling factor in 320 includes applying soft decisions in the quantizer 308 instead of the hard decision 312, In low SNR situations, the soft decisions could be zeros, leading to the same end result as applying a zero scaling factor in 320. Although the filter response is a function of frequency, notation indicating the dependence is omitted in the interest of brevity and clarity.<br><br>
(0027| The filtered signal is transformed to the time domain by the IFFT 324 and the descrambler/despreader 306 descrambles and despreads the time domain signal. The remaining modulated symbols represent the difference in the resulting data of the estimated received signal and the data of the received signal. The modulated error symbols are combined with the estimated transmitted modulation symbols in the combiner 132. The signal aligner 326 stores the modulated svmbols resulting from the operation of modulator 314 and delays the data in order to align the data with the corresponding modulated error symbols. The combined signal is forwarded to the signal demodulation where soil demodulation may be applied<br><br>
(TO28f FIG 4 is flow chart of a method of processing a received signal in accordance with the exemplary embodiment of the invention. The exemplary method is performed by components and software within an access terminal facilitating functions described <br><br>
above with reference to F?G.s S -3, The method, however, may be performed by any combination of hardware, software and/or firmware.<br><br>
JOO29| At step 402. an estimated transmitted signal is generated. In the exemplary embodiment the received signal is processed by a linear equalizer before the equalized signal is despread, descrambied and demodulated to generate the estimated transmitted data The estimated transmitted data is modulated, scrambled and spread in accordance with the techniques used in the base station to generate the estimated transmitted signal<br><br>
J0030J At step 404, a channel estimate is applied to the estimated transmitted signal to generate the estimated received signal<br><br>
|0G31] At step 406, an error signal based on the difference between the received signal and the estimated received signal is filtered by a filter having a response at least partially based on the channel estimate. In the exemplary embodiment, the filter has a response based on a comparison between the error signal and the received signal<br><br>
|0i)32j At step 408, the filtered error signal is combined with the estimated transmitted signal. In the exemplary embodiment, the filtered error signal is despread and descrambied and the resulting signal is added to the modulated estimated data. Accordingly, the modulated estimated data is stored or delayed and combined with the filtered despread and descrambied error signal<br><br>
