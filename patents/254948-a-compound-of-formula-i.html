FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention provides compounds having drug and bio-affecting properties, their pharmaceutical compositions and method of use. In particular, the invention is concerned with new prodrug derivatives with antiviral activity. More particularly, the present invention relates to compounds useful for the treatment of HIV and AIDS.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
HIV-1 (human iminunodeficiency virus -1) infection remains a major medical problem, with an estimated 42 million people infected worldwide at the end of 2002. The number of cases of HIV and AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) has risen rapidly. In 2002, ~5.0 million new infections were reported, and 3.1 million people died from AIDS. Currently available drugs for the treatment of HIV include ten nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors or approved single pill combinations (zidovudine or AZT (or Retrovir®), didanosine (or Videx®), stavudine (or Zerit®), lamivudine (or 3TC or Epivir®), zalcitabine (or DDC or Hivid®), abacavir succinate (or Ziagen®), Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate salt (or Viread®), Combivir® (contains -3TC plus AZT), Trizivir® (contains abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine) and Emtriva® (emtricitabine); three non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: nevirapine (or Viramune®), delavirdine (or Rescriptor®) and efavirenz (or Sustiva®), nine peptidomimetic protease inhibitors or approved formulations: saquinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, lopinavir, Kaletra®(lopinavir and<br>
Ritonavir), Atazanavir (Reyataz ), Fosamprenavir® and one fusion inhibitor which<br>
targets viral gp41 T-20 (FUZEON ). Each of these drugs can only transiently<br>
restrain viral replication if used alone. However, when used in combination, these<br>
drugs have a profound effect on viremia and disease progression. In fact, significant<br>
reductions in death rates among AIDS patients have been recently documented as a<br>
consequence of the widespread application of combination therapy. However,<br>
despite these impressive results, 30 to 50% of patients ultimately fail combination<br>
drag therapies. Insufficient drug potency, non-compliance, restricted tissue<br>
penetration and drug-specific limitations within certain cell types (e.g. most<br>
nucleoside analogs cannot be phosphorylated in resting cells) may account for the<br>
incomplete suppression of sensitive viruses. Furthermore, the high replication rate<br>
and rapid turnover of HIV-l combined with the frequent incorporation of mutations,<br>
leads to the appearance of drug-resistant variants and treatment failures when suboptimal<br>
drug concentrations are present (Larder and Kemp; Gulick; Kuritzkes;<br>
Morris-Jones et al\ Schinazi et al; Vacca and Condra; Flexner; Berkhout and Ren et<br>
al; (Ref. 6-14)). Therefore, novel anti-HIV agents exhibiting distinct resistance<br>
patterns, and favorable pharmacokinetic as well as safety profiles are needed to<br>
provide more treatment options.<br>
Currently marketed HIV-l drugs are dominated by either nucleoside reverse<br>
transcriptase inhibitors or peptidomimetic protease inhibitors. Non-nucleoside<br>
reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) have recently gained an increasingly<br>
important role in the therapy of HIV infections (Pedersen &amp; Pedersen, Ref 15). At<br>
least 30 different classes of NNRTI have been described in the literature (De Clercq,<br>
Ref. 16) and several NNRTIs have been evaluated in clinical trials.<br>
Dipyridodiazepinone (nevirapine), benzoxazinone (efavirenz) and bis(heteroaryl)<br>
piperazine derivatives (delavirdine) have been approved for clinical use. However,<br>
the major drawback to the development and application of NNRTIs is the propensity<br>
for rapid emergence of drug resistant strains, both in tissue cell culture and in treated<br>
individuals, particularly those subject to monotherapy. As a consequence, there is<br>
considerable interest in the identification of NNRTIs less prone to the development of<br>
resistance (Pedersen &amp; Pedersen, Ref 15). A recent overview of non-nucleoside<br>
reverse transcriptase inhibitors: "Perspectives on novel therapeutic compounds and<br>
strategies for the treatment of HIV infection", has appeared (Buckheit, reference 99).<br>
A review covering both NRTI andNNRTIs has appeared (De Clercq, reference 100).<br>
An overview of the current state of the HIV drugs has been published (De Clercq,<br>
reference 101).<br>
Several indole derivatives including indole-3-sulfones, piperazino indoles,<br>
pyrazino indoles, and 5H-indolo[3,2-b][l,5]benzothiazepine derivatives have been<br>
reported as HIV-1 reverse transciptase inhibitors (Greenlee et al, Ref. 1; Williams et<br>
al, Ref. 2; Romero et al, Ref. 3; Font et al, Ref. 17; Romero et al, Ref. 18; Young et<br>
al, Ref. 19; Genin et al, Ref. 20; Silvestri et al, Ref. 21). Indole 2-carboxamides have<br>
also been described as inhibitors of cell adhesion and HIV infection (Boschelli et al,<br>
US 5,424,329, Ref. 4). 3-Substituted indole natural products (Semicochliodinol A<br>
and B, didemethylasterriquinone and isocochliodinol) were disclosed as inhibitors of<br>
HIV-1 protease (Fredenhagen et al, Ref. 22).<br>
Structurally related aza-indole amide derivatives have been disclosed<br>
previously (Kato et al, Ref. 23(a); Levacher et al, Ref. 23(b); Dompe Spa, WO-<br>
09504742, Ref. 5(a); SmitliKline BeechamPLC, WO-09611929, Ref. 5(b); Schering<br>
Corp., US-05023265, Ref. 5(c)). However, these structures differ from those claimed<br>
herein in that they are monoaza-indole mono-amide rather than oxoacetamide<br>
derivatives, and there is no mention of the use of these compounds for treating viral<br>
infections, particularly HIV.<br>
New drugs for the treatment of HIV are needed for the treatment of patients<br>
who become resistant to the currently approved drugs described above which target<br>
reverse transcriptase or the protease. One approach to obtaining these drugs is to find<br>
molecules which inhibit new and different targets of the virus. A general class of<br>
inhibitors which are under active study are HIV entry inhibitors. This general<br>
classification includes drugs aimed at several targets which include chemokine<br>
receptor (CCR5 or CXCR4) inhibitors, fusion inhibitors targeting viral gp41, and<br>
inhibitors which prevent attachment of the viral envelope, gp!20, the its human<br>
cellular target CD4. A number of reviews or general papers on viral entry inhibitors<br>

There are two general approaches for preventing the initial attachment of viral<br>
membrane, gp!20, to cellular CD4 which are a) inhibitors which bind to human CD4<br>
and block attachment of viral envelope (gp!20) and b) inhibitors which bind to viral<br>
gp!20 and prevent the binding of cellular CD4. The second approach has the<br>
advantage that it inhibits a viral target and, if selective, minimizes the chances of<br>
perturbing nonnal human physiology or causing side effects. With this approach, in<br>
order to overcome a spectrum in susceptability to drug caused by variability in the<br>
sequences of viral envelope and to suppress the development of resistance, it is<br>
important to achieve plasma levels of drug that is as many multiples as possible over<br>
the EC50 or other measure of the concentration of drug needed to kill virus. As<br>
discussed later, these inhibitors appear safe so to be of wide utility in man they,<br>
therefore, must be able to achieve exposure levels sufficient to enable virus<br>
suppression. The higher the multiple of drug levels over the level needed to inhibit<br>
viral growth, the more efficiently and completely the suppresion of viral replication<br>
and the lower the chance for viral mutation and subsequent development of resistance<br>
to treatment. Thus, important aspects contributing to the efficacy of viral attachment<br>
inhibitors include not only intrinsic potency and safety, but also pharmacokinetics and<br>
pharmaceutical properties which allow attainment of high plasma exposure at a<br>
physically feasible dose and an acceptable, preferably convenient, administration<br>
schedule. This invention describes a prodrug approach which greatly enhances the<br>
maximum exposure and the ability to increase exposure multiples (i.e., multiples of<br>
drug exposure greater than ECso or ECgo) upon dose escalation of efficacious<br>
members of a previously disclosed class of HIV attachment inhibitors.<br>
A series of recent publications and disclosures characterize and describe a<br>
compound labelled as BMS-806, an initial member of a class of viral entry inhibitors<br>
which target viral gp-120 and prevent attachment of virus to host CD4.<br>

N-1 nitrogen<br>
BMS-806<br>
hadole, azaindole and other oxo amide containing derivatives from this class<br>
have been disclosed in a number of different PCX and issued U.S. patent applications<br>
(Reference 93-95, 106, 108, 109,110, 111, and 112) and these references directly<br>
relate to the compounds in this patent application. None of the compounds in these<br>
references of prior art contain a methyl dihydrogen phosphate (or salt or mono or di<br>
ester of the phosphate group) group appended to the N-1 nitrogen and thus the<br>
compounds of this current invention represent new compositions of matter. This<br>
moiety dramatically increases the utility of the parent compounds by functioning as a<br>
prodrug modification which dramatically increases the maximum systemic exposure<br>
of the parent molecules in preclinical models of human exposure. We believe<br>
nothing in the prior art references can be construed to disclose or suggest the novel<br>
compounds of this invention and their use to inhibit HIV infection.<br>
This invention describes prodrugs of specific indole and azaindole<br>
ketopiperazine amides which are extremely effective at improving the oral utility of<br>
the parent molecules as antiviral agents particular/ as anti HIV drugs. The parent<br>
molecules are relatively insoluble, and suffer from dissolution-limited or solubility<br>
limited absorption which means as the dose is increased above a maximum level, less<br>
and less of the drug dissolves in time to be absorbed into the circulation and they are<br>
instead passed through the body to be eliminated as waste. The improvements<br>
offered by the prodrug are necessary, for they allow drug levels in the body to be<br>
increased significantly, which provides greater efficacy vs HIV virus and in particular<br>
vs less sensitive or more resistant strains. Prodrugs are especially important for this<br>
class of drugs since the drugs target the envelope of the HIV virus, a target which<br>
varies from strain to strain and thus in which maximum exposure multiples are<br>
desired. Because with a prodrug, more of the drug will be absorbed and reach the<br>
target, pill burden, cost to the patient and dosing intervals could be reduced. The<br>
identification of prodrugs with these properties is difficult and neither<br>
straightforward, nor is a clear path to successful prodrug design disclosed hi the<br>
literature. There is no clear prior art teaching of which prodrug chemistry to employ<br>
nor which will be most effective. The following discussion and data will show that<br>
the prodrugs described in this invention work surprisingly well. They release parent<br>
drug extremely quickly and efficiently and enhance the exposure to levels which are<br>
higher than reported for many prodrugs.<br>
The use of prodrug strategies or methodologies to markedly enhance<br>
properties of a drug or to overcome an inherent deficiency in the pharmaceutic or<br>
pharmacokinetic properties of a drug can be used in certain circumstances to<br>
markedly enhance the utility of a drug. Prodrugs differ from formulations in that<br>
chemical modifications lead to an entirely new chemical entity which upon<br>
administration to the patient, regenerates the parent molecule within the body. A<br>
myriad of prodrug strategies exist which provide choices in modulating the<br>
conditions for regeneration of the parent drug, the physical, pharmaceutic, or<br>
pharmacokinetic properties of the prodrug, and the functionality to which the prodrug<br>
modifications may be attached. However, none of these publications teach what<br>
approach to use that result in the specific prodrugs herein invented. A number of<br>
reviews or discussions on prodrug strategies have been published and a<br>

While some technologies are known to have specific applications, ie to<br>
improve solubility or absorption for example, the development of prodrugs remains,<br>
to a great extent, an empirical exercise. Thus a number of strategies or chemical<br>
modifications must usually be surveyed and the resulting compounds evaluated in<br>
biological models in order to ascertain and gauge the success of prodrug strategies.<br>
A successful prodrug strategy requires that a chemically reactive site in a<br>
molecule be modified via addition of the prodrug moiety and that later under the<br>
desired conditions in the patients the prodrug moiety will unmask and release parent<br>
drug. The prodrug molecule must have suitable stability in an acceptable dosage<br>
form prior to dosing, hi addition, the release mechanism must allow the prodrug to<br>
regenerate parent drug efficiently and with kinetics that provide therapeutic levels of<br>
parent drug at the disease target, hi our molecules, the indole or azaindole nitrogen<br>
represents an acceptable point of attachment for a prodrug moiety.<br>
The suggestion that a phosphate group joined by an appropriate chemistry or<br>
linker can enhance oral exposure of a parent drug is a concept known in the art.<br>
However, as will be discussed below, it is unpredictable to know that if using a<br>
phosphate group to create a prodrug will work with a given drug substance. The<br>
phosphate group temporarily alters the physical properties of the drug and is, thus, a<br>
prodrug which increases the aqueous solubility of the resulting molecule, until it is<br>
cleaved by alkaline phosphatase in the body or other chemical reaction of a rationally<br>
designed linker. For example, in the following reference, the authors conclude<br>
phosphates may improve oral efficac)'. In this reference a phosphate derivative of an<br>
alcohol group in a poorly water soluble, lipophilic drug displayed better oral<br>
bioavailbility than two other prodrugs and appeared to offer an advantage over the<br>
parent molecule which possesed low oral bioavailability.<br>

Two very pertinent and recent papers have published which discuss the<br>
difficulties of identifying phosphate prodrugs with significant advantages over the<br>
parent molecule for oral use.<br>
A paper entitled "Absorption Rate Limit Considerations for Oral Phosphate<br>
Prodrugs" by Tycho Heimbach et. al. in Pharmaceutical Research 2003, Vol 20, No.<br>
6 pages 848-856 states "The surprising inability to use phosphate prodrugs by the oral<br>
route prompted a study in a system being used to screen drug candidates for<br>
absorption potential." This paper also reviews the reasons many phosphate prodrugs<br>
were unsuitable for oral use and discusses several potential rate limiting factors in the<br>
drug absorption process. The paper also identifies the few successful applications.<br>
The paper attempts to identify properties which may make some drugs suitable for<br>
oral delivery as phosphate prodrugs but the message is clear that this is still an<br>
empirical science. This is emphasized by the conclusions of a second paper by the<br>
same authors entitled "Enzyme mediated precipitation of parent drugs from their<br>
phosphate prodrugs" by Tycho Heimbach et. al in International Journal of<br>
Pharmaceutics 2003, 261, 81-92. The authors state in the Abstract that many oral<br>
phosphate prodrugs have failed to improve the rate or extent of absorption compared<br>
to their insoluble parent drugs. Rapid parent drug generation via intestinal alkaline<br>
phosphatase can result in supersaturated solutions, leading to parent drug<br>
precipitation. This would limit utility of the oral phopshates. The conclusions of this<br>
paper state (quoted) "hi summary, precipitation of parent drugs from phosphate<br>
prodrugs can be enzyme mediated. Preciptitation of certain drugs can also be<br>
observed for certain drugs in the Caco-2 model. Since induction times decrease and<br>
nucleation times increase with high supersaturation ratios, parent drugs can<br>
precipitate when targeted prodrugs concentration are much higher than than the<br>
parent drug's solubility ie for parent drugs with high supersaturation ratios. The<br>
extent to which a parent drug precipitates during conversion of the prodrug is<br>
dependent on the prodrug to parent conversion rates, prodrug effect on the<br>
precipitation of parent drug, and the solubilization of the parent drug." As can be<br>
seen by the author's conclusion, the process is a complex one and is dependent on<br>
many factors which are impossible to predict in advance such as supersaturation<br>
ratios, rate of prodrug conversions in vivo, and ability of the intestinal milieu to<br>
solubilize parent and prodrug mixtures.<br>
The two references by Heimbach describe the clinical status of phosphate<br>
prodrugs and discuss the many failures and few successful examples. One example<br>
of a clinical failure and one example of a success are provided below:<br>
Etoposide® is an anticancer drug which is administered either via iv or oral routes.<br>
Etoposide phosphate prodrugs are used clinically, but these structures differ from the<br>
derivatives of the current application as this prodrug contains a phosphate formed by<br>
direct attachment to a phenol moiety of the parent drug. The main reasons for<br>
preparing a phosphate prodrug of the drug etoposide were to improve intravenous use<br>
via increased solubility and reduction of excipients. Although the phosphate prodrug<br>
was evaluated orally both preclinically and clinically it is only used clinically for iv<br>
administration.<br>

phosphate moiety for oral dosing were not clear.<br>

This earlier paper found that compared with literature data, oral EP had a 19%<br>
higher F value compared with oral E either at low or high doses. They concluded this<br>
higher F in E from oral prodrug EP appears to be a pharmacological advantage that<br>
could be of potential pharmacodynamic importance for this drug. However the<br>
previously mentioned study which reached opposite conclusions was done later and it<br>
appears that the direct comparision data was more valid. Thus adding a phosphate<br>
group to improve solubility is not a guarantee of improved oral efficacy.<br>
A phosphate prodrug of the HIV protease inhibitor Amprenavir was prepared<br>
and is the active ingredient of what has now become an improved drug for oral use.<br>
This is an example of a rare success from this approach. The phosphate is directly<br>
attached to a hydroxy moiety and serves to enhance solubility. Fosamprenavir alone<br>
or in combination with another protease inhibitor ritonavir, which serves to inhibit<br>
Cytochrome P450 3 A4-mediated metabolic deactivation, allow patients to receive<br>
fewer pills, smaller pills (due to the need for less excipients), and to employ a less<br>
frequent dosing schedule. Clearly, the structure of Amprenavir is significantly<br>
different than the molecules of the present invention and does not predict success<br>
with other classes of drugs or phosphate linker chemistry. Two references on<br>
Fosamprenavir are included below but most recent data can be found by searching a<br>
database well known in the art such as IDDB (A commercial database called<br>

Regarding indole phosphate prodrugs, the publication by Zhu et. al. describes<br>
a study to find an effective phosphate prodrug of PD 154075. In this molecule, either<br>
the direct indole phosphate or a methyl dihydrogen phosphate or salt prodrug of the<br>
indole nitrogen were unsuitable prodrugs due to a slow rate of regenerating the parent<br>
molecule. Thus the novel and complex linker depicted below was developed to<br>
incorporate a solubilizing phosphate.<br>

Many of the references describe the design of prodrugs for purposes other<br>
than overcoming dissolution-limited absorption. A number of the prodrugs are not<br>
attached to the indole or azaindole nitrogen or are designed to release radical<br>
intermediates rather than the parent drug. The prodrugs described in this art and their<br>
properties do not provide obvious solutions for improving the properties of the parent<br>
HIV attachment inhibitors.<br>
It has now been found that new methyl dihydrogen phosphate produgs and<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the general structure shown below are useful as<br>
anti HIV agents with a new mechanism that is currently not employed by exisiting<br>
drugs. The need for drugs with new mechanisms is great since patients are left with<br>
no options if they become resistant to the current drug classes, hi addition, drugs<br>
with new mechanisms can be used in combinations with known classes of inhibitors<br>
to cover the emergence of resistance to these drugs since strains of resistant virus are<br>
likely still susceptible to drugs with an alternative mechanism.<br>
We have found that these prodrugs are more water soluble than the parent<br>
molecules, and rapidly convert to the parents after oral dosing in rodents or in in vitro<br>
assays with human enzymes or tissues, hi addition, in one oral dose escalation study,<br>
a prodrug provided surprising enhancements in drug exposure (AUC) and maximum<br>
concentration (Cmax) as the dose increased. These predictive studies suggest these<br>
prodrugs should provide advantages in dogs and humans.<br>
The parent compound IVa has been studied in human clinical trials. The<br>
compound was dosed in healthy human volunteers. A graph of the exposure vs dose<br>
is shown in Figure 1.<br>
As can be seen, single doses of a capsule formulation (red triangles) ranged in<br>
size from 200-2400mgs in 200mg increments. It is also readily apparent from the<br>
oral AUCs, that increases in drug exposure increased much more slowly and less than<br>
proportionally with dose. In fact the differences or increase in exposure above<br>
SOOmgs is minimal. With the dose ratios of 1:2:4:6:9:12 for capsule treatment under<br>
fasted condition, the ratios of mean Cmax and AUC values are 1:1.3:2.4:2.3:2.1:2.7<br>
and 1:1.5:2.3:2.0:1.9:2.4, respectively. Between 200-800 mg dose range the increases<br>
in systemic exposure is dose-related although less than dose-proportional, while such<br>
exposure is dose independent above dose of 800 mg. This phenomenon indicates that<br>
the absorption of Compound IVa with the capsule formulation used is saturable<br>
under fasted conditions.<br>
The dose proportionality in systemic exposure seems to be much better<br>
presented under fed condition (high fat meal) as ratios of Cmax and AUC are 1.6 and<br>
1.5, respectively, when the dose ratio is 1:2.3 (800 mg vs. 1800 mg). As can be seen<br>
by comparing the single 200mg dose of a solution of IVa (dark red square) with that<br>
of the 200mg capsule dose, exposure from the solution was higher. Dosing with a<br>
solution increased Compound IVa exposure. The Cmax and AUC of the solution<br>
were approximately 8- and 3-fold, respectively, of those of the capsule (200 mg).<br>
The relative bioavailability (32%) of the capsule to the solution formulation suggests<br>
absorption is dissolution rate-limited, suggesting a potential to enhance systemic<br>
exposure by improving the formulation.<br>
A high fat meal had a positive food-effect on the compound. The Cmax after<br>
a fed treatment were approximately 2.6 and 4.6 fold for 800 and 1800 mg doses,<br>
respectively, of those of the fast treatment. The AUCs after a fed treatment were<br>
approximately 2.5 and 4.7 fold for 800 and 1800 mg doses, respectively, of those of<br>
the fasted treatment. The relative bioavailability (fed vs. fasted) values were 293%<br>
and 509% for 800 mg and 1800 mg doses, respectively. The median Tmax changed<br>
from 1.25 or 2 (fasted) to 4 (fed) hours.<br>
For the 800 mg capsule with food, the average plasma concentration is 1001<br>
and 218 ng/mL at 8 and 12 hours post dose, respectively. The results supported a<br>
q!2h or q8h dosing regimen for a targeted Cmin value of at least 200 ng/mL after<br>
multiple doses. This value was selected based on preclinical data. A further<br>
summary of some of this data presented as a bar graph is shown in the second bar<br>
graph in Figure 2B.<br>
MULTIPLE DOSE STUDY IN HEALTHY HUMANS<br>
A placebo-controlled, ascending multiple-dose study to evaluate the safety,<br>
tolerability and pharmacokinetics of Compound IVa in healthy human subjects was<br>
carried out. Dosing was continued at 12h intervals for 14days. In summary, the<br>
preliminary PK results indicated that, after single and multiple Q12H doses of<br>
Compound IVa, the exposure is generally dose proportional over the dose ranges of<br>
400 to 1200 mg and 400 to 800 mg with high fat meal and light meal, respectively,<br>
the exposure seems to be dose independent above these dose levels with the different<br>
meal types, the accumulation is low to moderate (up to ~1.5 fold), and that there is a<br>
diurnal variation in the exposure in that exposure is higher after an evening dose than<br>
that after a morning dose. Thus, the exposure was better when dosing was combined<br>
with a high fat meal and exposure increases with dose were higher with a high fat<br>
meal.<br>
This is similar to the results obtained in the above single dose study.<br>
MULTIPLE DOSE STUDY IN HIV PATIENTS<br>
Based on the exposure data from the studies in normal volunteers, an efficacy<br>
study was carried out in HIV patients. An inital disclosure of this data has been made<br>
in a talk and published abstract. "Antiviral Activity, Safety, and Tolerability of a<br>

5,000-500,000 c/mL. There were 15 subjects in each dose arm and the ratio of<br>

The placebo-controlled, sequential study of IVa utilized an initial dose arm of<br>
800 mg PO every!2h followed by a second dosing arm of 1800 mg PO administered<br>
every 12h. It is important to note that drug was administered in a capsule and in<br>
combination with a high fat meal to increase exposure and plasma levels. Study drug<br>
was administered for 7 days and the morning of Day 8. Subjects were followed for<br>

1. As can be seen by the data for the SOOmg dosing level in combination with a<br>
high fat meal, significant antiviral activity was observed. However, only 58% of<br>
patients had 1.0 log drop in viral load. A more robust antiviral response was seen<br>
with the ISOOmg dosing regimen with a high fat meal where the mean response was a<br>
-.96 loglO drop in viral load. This data shows that this drug has significant antiviral<br>
activity at doses of SOOmg and ISOOmg (and thus in between) every 12hours in<br>
combination with a high fat meal and therefore it could play a significant role in<br>
combination therapy. An updated summary of the results with BMS-043 in man can<br>
be obtained by viewing the abstract or slides from the oral presentation: "Antiviral<br>

and Opportunistic Infections (CROI), San Francisco, CA.<br>
Unfortunately, it will be unfeasible to deliver this drug chronically over many<br>
months involving administration of a total of 9 capsules of 200 mg each, twice a day<br>
in combination with a high fat meal for obvious health reasons so a new formulation<br>
will be needed which provides increased exposure from a lower dose and which<br>
eliminates the need for a high fat meal.<br>
Thus the clinical data shows that a method for improving the exposure of this<br>
drug from lower doses and in the absence of a high fat meal is necessary.<br>
Thus the initial data on the prodrugs of this invention surprisingly predicts<br>
they will improve the exposure of molecules such as IVa and deliver the parent drugs<br>
in concentrations that will allow the drugs to be used in the absence of high fat meals,<br>
with lower capsule burden, and chronically as a component of antiretroviral therapy.<br>
Initial data obtained from dosing solid capsules of either the prodrug lab<br>
(lysine salt) or solid parent molecule (IVa) to dogs are summarized in the first bar<br>
graph Figure 2 A of Figure 2. As can be seen, after dosing prodrug lab (mono lysine<br>
salt) either in fasted or dogs fed a high fat meal, the exposure is surprisingly high<br>
when compared to dosing parent molecule. Also, the effect of fed vs fasted state is<br>
minimal if any for the prodrug yet has an obvious effect on the exposure after dosing<br>
the solid parent molecule. Thus, surprisingly, the exposure of parent molecule after<br>
dosing of prodrug, shows no dependence on a high fat meal which predicts for more<br>
consistent exposure levels after dosing than those from parent molecule. The bar<br>
graph in Figure 2B summarizes the previously discussed human data for parent<br>
molecule IVa and shows the dependence of exposure for the molecule on the high fat<br>
meal, the non proportional increases in exposure vs dose, and the better exposure<br>
from dosing a solution rather than solid formulation. As discussed below, this shows<br>
dissolution or absorption rate limited exposure which in preclinical models, appears<br>
to be surprisingly improved via use of the phosphate prodrug. The use of phosphate<br>
prodrugs also increased exposure in fasted dogs vs parent for two other prodrugs.<br>
Details of these experiments are contained in the experimental section. In addition,<br>
details from various studies in rats, dogs, and monkeys for two additional prodrug<br>
examples and in rats for another two prodrugs demonstrate the surprising utility of<br>
these prodrugs to increase exposure over that obtained parent moelcule at doses<br>
which correlate to those likely to be of utility for the treatment and inhibition of HIV<br>
viral replication.<br>

It is known in the art that nitogen atoms in heteroaryl systems can be<br>
"participating in a heteroaryl ring double bond", and this refers to the form of double<br>
bonds in the two tautomeric structures which comprise five-member ring heteroaryl<br>
groups. This dictates whether nitrogens can be substituted as well understood by<br>
chemists in the art. The disclosure and claims of the present invention are based on<br>
the known general principles of chemical bonding. It is understood that the claims do<br>
not encompass structures known to be unstable or not able to exist based on the<br>
literature.<br>
Physiologically acceptable salts of the prodrug compounds disclosed herein<br>
are within the scope of this invention. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" as<br>
used herein and in the claims is intended to include nontoxic base addition salts. The<br>
term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" as used herein is also intended to include salts<br>
of acidic groups, such as a carboxylate or phosphate or phosphate mono ester, with<br>
such counterions as ammonium, alkali metal salts, particularly sodium or potassium,<br>
alkaline earth metal salts, particularly calcium or magnesium, transition metal salts<br>
such as zinc and salts with suitable organic bases such as lower alkylamines<br>
(methylamine, ethylamine, cyclohexylamrne, and the like) or with substituted lower<br>
alkylamines (e.g. hydroxyl-substituted alkylamines such as diethanolamine,<br>
triethanolamine or mono tromethamine (also called TRIS or 2-amino-2~<br>
(hydroxymethyl)propane-l,3-diol) tris(hydroxymethyl)-ammomethane), lysine,<br>
arginine, histidine, N-methylglucamine, or with bases such as piperidine or<br>
morpholine. It is understood that both pharmaceutically acceptable salts, when<br>
isolated in solid or crystalline form., also include hydrates or water molecules<br>
entrapped within the resulting Compound I substance. Stoichiometry possibilities are<br>
well known to those in the art. Discussions of pharmaceutically acceptable salts and<br>
lists of possible salts are contained in the following references:<br>

In the method of the present invention, the term "antiviral effective amount"<br>
means the total amount of each active component of the method that is sufficient to<br>
show a meaningful patient benefit, i.e., healing of acute conditions characterized by<br>
inhibition of the HIV infection. When applied to an individual active ingredient,<br>
administered alone, the term refers to mat ingredient alone. When applied to a<br>
combination, the term refers to combined amounts of the active ingredients that result<br>
in the therapeutic effect, whether administered in combination, serially or<br>
simultaneously. The terms "treat, treating, treatment" as used herein and in the claims<br>
means preventing or ameliorating diseases associated with HIV infection.<br>
The present invention is also directed to combinations of the compounds with<br>
one or more agents useful in the treatment of AIDS. For example, the compounds of<br>
this invention may be effectively administered, whether at periods of pre-exposure<br>
and/or post-exposure, in combination with effective amounts of the AIDS antivirals,<br>
immunomodulators, antiinfectives, or vaccines, such as those in the following table.<br>

Specifically the compounds can be utilized in combination Avith other attachment<br>
inhibitors, fusion inhibitors, and chemokine receptor antagonists aimed at either the<br>
CCR5 or CXCR4 coreceptor.<br>
It will be understood that the scope of combinations of the compounds of this<br>
invention with AIDS antivirals, immunomodulators, anti-infectives, HIV entry<br>
inhibitors or vaccines is not limited to the list in the above Table but includes, in<br>
principle, any combination with any pharmaceutical composition useful for the<br>
treatment of AIDS.<br>
Preferred combinations are simultaneous or alternating treatments with a<br>
compound of the present invention and an inhibitor of HIV protease and/or a nonnucleoside<br>
inhibitor of HIV reverse transcriptase. An optional fourth component in<br>
the combination is a nucleoside inhibitor of HIV reverse transcriptase, such as AZT,<br>
3TC, ddC or ddl. A preferred inhibitor of HIV protease is Reyataz® (active<br>
ingredient Atazanavir). Typically a dose of 300 to 600mg is administered once a day.<br>
This may be co-administered with a low dose of Ritonavir (50 to SOOmgs). Another<br>
preferred inhibitor of HIV protease is Kaletra®. Another useful inhibitor of HIV<br>
protease is indinavir, which is the sulfate salt of N-(2(R)-hydroxy-l-(S)-indanyl)-<br>
2(R)-phenylmethyl-4-(S)-hydroxy-5-(l-(4-(3-pyridyl-methyl)-2(S)-NI-(tbutylcarboxamido)-<br>
piperazinyl))-pentaneamide ethanolate, and is synthesized<br>
according to U.S. 5,413,999. Indinavir is generally administered at a dosage of 800<br>
mg three times a day. Other preferred protease inhibitors are nelfinavir and ritonavir.<br>
Another preferred inhibitor of HIV protease is saquinavir which is administered in a<br>
dosage of 600 or 1200 mg tid. Preferred non-nucleoside inhibitors of HIV reverse<br>
transcriptase include efavirenz. The preparation of ddC, ddl and AZT are also<br>
described in EPO 0,484,071. These combinations may have unexpected effects on<br>
limiting the spread and degree of infection of HIV. Preferred combinations include<br>
those with the following (1) indinavir with efavirenz, and, optionally, AZT and/or<br>
3TC and/or ddl and/or ddC; (2) indinavir, and any of AZT and/or ddl and/or ddC<br>
and/or 3TC, in particular, indinavir and AZT and 3TC; (3) stavudine and 3TC and/or<br>
zidovudine; (4) zidovudine and lamivudine and 141W94 and 1592U89; (5)<br>
zidovudine and lamivudine.<br>
In such combinations the compound of the present invention and other active<br>
agents may be administered separately or in conjunction, hi addition, the<br>
administration of one element maybe prior to, concurrent to, or subsequent to the<br>
administration of other agent(s).<br>

CHEMISTRY<br>
The present invention comprises compounds of Formula I, their<br>
pharmaceutical formulations, and their use in patients suffering from or susceptible to<br>
HIV infection.<br>
Scheme A depicts an overview of the process for preparing the prodrugs I of<br>
the invention from the parent molecules IV.<br>
To elaborate on the method, as shown in Scheme A, the antiviral parent<br>
compound of interest, IV, is converted into the phosphate intermediate II, byNalkylation<br>
with chloride intermediate III, in the presence of a suitable base such as<br>
sodium hydride, potassium hydride, sodium amide, sodium t-butoxide, sodium (bis<br>
trimethylsilyl) amide, potassium (bis trimethyl silyl) amide, or combinations thereof<br>
such as sodium hydride plus sodium bis (trimethylsilyl) amide. The preparation of<br>
reagent HI and the methodology for use in preparing prodrugs by the alkylation<br>
hydroxy groups has been described in Y. Ueda et.al. U.S. Patent 6,362,172B2 which<br>
is incorporated by reference in its entirety. The alkylation conditions, protecting<br>
groups, protecting group removal, and conditions for salt formation are in general<br>
applicable to our application despite the fact that we are alkylating an azaindole in the<br>
indole ring rather than a hydroxy group. In the current application, from 1.1 to 5.0<br>
equivalents of base maybe utilized with between 2 and 4 equivalents being preferred.<br>
From 1.1 up to 12 equivalents of reagent III may be used with 5 to 10 being preferred<br>
depending on the substrate. The reagent may be added in one portion or<br>
incrementally in several portions over time. A source of iodide ion is usually added<br>
to the reaction to provide increased yields. Elemental iodine is currently preferred as<br>
the source of iodide. 0.1 to 1.5 equivalents of iodine are usually added per<br>
azaindole/indole NH being alkylated with 1.0 to 1.2 equivalents of iodine being<br>
preferred since yields are highest. Alternate sources of iodide include, for example,<br>
sodium iodide, lithium iodide, cesium iodide, copper iodide, or tetrabutyl ammonium<br>
iodide. The function of iodine is presumably to generate the corresponding<br>
iodomethyl reagent Ilia in situ from the chloro methyl reagent III. The iodo or bromo<br>
reagents corresponding to III could likely be used directly in the reaction in place of<br>
the chloride III. The alkylation reaction of step A is usually carried out in an inert<br>
organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at a temperature from about 0°C to 50°C,<br>
more preferably between 20° and 40°C. Other anhydrous organic solvents such as<br>
methyl tetrahydrofuran, methyl t-butyl ether, dioxane, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether,<br>
dimethyl acetamide, or N5N-dimethylfornianiide could also find utility. Ester<br>
intermediate II is then subjected to a conventional deprotection step to remove the<br>
protecting groups Pr. The reagents used in such step will depend on the protecting<br>
group used, but will be well known to those skilled in the art. The most preferred<br>
protecting group is the t-butyl group which can be removed with trifluoroacetic acid,<br>
hydrochloric acid, or formic acid in an appropriate inert organic solvent. The inert<br>
solvent can be dichloromethane, or possibly, for example, dichloroethane, toluene, or<br>
trifluoromethyl benzene, hi methylene chloride, trifluoroacetic acid deprotection may<br>
be effected using from 1 to 15 equivalents of acid (or the acid can be measured<br>
differently as for example a 5% solution in solvent by volume) and temperatures of<br>
between 0° and 40°. hi general, the greater excess of TFA employed, the lower the<br>
temperature utilized. Exact conditions vary with substrate. Step 3 describes the<br>
isolation of the free acid or salts which can be formed via many standard ways which<br>
are well known in the art. Generally, following TFA deprotection, an aqueous<br>
workup is employed in which the excess acid is neutralized with a base and the<br>
organic impurities removed via extraction with an organic solvent such as ethyl<br>
acetate or dichloromethane. For example excess aqueous NaOH may be used to<br>
basify the reaction nixture. This is welt known to any chemist skilled in the art.<br>
Reacidification of the aqueous phase to pH 2.5 with aqueous IN HC1 and then<br>
extraction with an organic solvent will provide, after removal of solvent in vacuo., the<br>
free acid. The free acid may be converted to inorganic salts by the addition of<br>
appropriate bases in solvents such as water, methanol, ethanol, etc. For example,<br>
addition of sodium carbonate to an aqueous solution of phosphate prodrug and<br>
adjustment of the pH to approximately 7.6 provides a solution which upon removal of<br>
water via lypohilization leaves the disodium salt of the prodrug. Potassium<br>
carbonate could be used similarly. Aqueous solutions of sodium bicarbonate or<br>
potassium bicarbonate could be used similarly. Mono potassium or mono sodium<br>
salts could be generated via careful titration of phosphate acid solutions with<br>
potassium or sodium 2-ethyl hexanoate. Amine salts can be generated by dissolving<br>
the free acid in organic solvents such as ethyl acetate or acetom'trile or low molecular<br>
weight alcohols or mixtures of these solvents optionally containing water. Some<br>
amines potentially useful for salt formation include: lower alkylamines<br>
(methylamine, ethylamine, cyclohexylamine, and the like) or substituted lower<br>
alkylamines (e.g. hydroxyl-substituted alkylamines such as diethanolamine,<br>
triethanolamine or tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane), lysine, arginine, histidine, Nmethylglucamine,<br>
or bases such as piperidine or morpholine. Slow addition of an<br>
amine to a stirring solution at low temperature can provide either the mono of bis<br>
amine salt depending on stoichiornetry. Amine salts can also be obtained by stirring<br>
the solution and removing the solvent in vacuo rather than be crystallization or<br>
precipitation. Recrystallization procedures will vary by compound and salt but are<br>
available to one skilled in the art. Scheme B depicts a preferred sequence and set of<br>
reagents and conditions for carrying out the general sequence shown in Scheme A.<br>
An alternate and in many cases the preferred method for carrying out the sequence in<br>
step C which includes the deprotection of the diester to provide the intermediate acid<br>
insitu followed by salt formation in the reaction medium may be utilized. For<br>
example, heating the diester II in a mixture of water and a water miscible cosolvent<br>
such as for example acetone, methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol can produce the free<br>
acid of I in the reaction medium (insitu). A preferred solvent is acetone and<br>
isopropanol. Temperatures between ambient and the boiling points of the solvents<br>
could be utilized. Typically 40° to 60° C is in the preferred range. Addition of a<br>
base or more preferably an amine as described above to the reaction mixture<br>
containing the free acid in the water and cosolvent can produce the salt directly. If<br>
appropriate conditions are selected, the salt, may crystallize or precipitate directly<br>
from the reaction medium and be isolated by filtration and drying. Specific examples<br>
are contained in the experimental section.<br>
The preferred method of preparation of intermediates Ha, lib, and lie and of<br>
the acids lac, Ibc and Ic offers a number of significant advantages over the procedures<br>
used initially for preparation of Ha, lib, and He during exploratory research efforts.<br>
The initial discovery routes for the preparation of all three intermediates II used a<br>
preparation of di-tertbutyl chloromethyl phosphate that required the use of relatively<br>
expensive tetrabutylammonium di tert-butyl phosphate which was reacted with a 10<br>
fold excess of expensive and potentially hazardous choro iodomethane. The excess<br>
volatiles and iodomethane were removed in vacuo to provide the crude reagent which<br>
was used without further purification. At least a 5 fold excess of this reagent was<br>
used to react with compounds IV meaning that at least 5 equivalents of<br>
tetrabutylammonium phosphate and 50 equivalents of choloriodomethane were used<br>
as compared to quantities of either FVa, b or c. In addition, alleviation of compounds<br>
IV with this reagent was achieved using Nail as base and iodine as an additive to<br>
promote alkylation. These conditions produced a reaction mixture containing the<br>
desired compound II as a major product and side products which were removed using<br>
silica gel chromatography, a tedious, time consuming, and expensive operation<br>
especially on reactions of increasing scale . Failure to remove side products, resulted<br>
in products I from the next step, the removal of the protecting groups, that contained<br>
impurities which were very difficult to remove in a satisfactory manner in either a<br>
reasonable yield or time frame.<br>
The improved preparation of di-tertbutyl chloromethyl phosphate utilizes less<br>
expensive ditertbutyl potassium phosphate and only an approximate 2 fold excess of<br>
this reagent as compared to the other reactant chloromethyl sulfonyl choride. The diterbutyl<br>
chloromethyl phosphate prepared by this method is isolated in pure form via<br>
convenient distillation.<br>
For the conversion of IVa to Ha, only 1.2 equivalents of this reagent was used<br>
to alkylate compounds IV. In addition, a less reactive and economical base,<br>
potassium carbonate, was used in conjunction with DMSO to achieve an alkylation in<br>
which the compounds II produced are sufficiently free of side products that they can<br>
be used without chromatographic purification as inputs for the deprotection reaction.<br>
The free acid lac or salts such as lab for example can be obtained in pure form from<br>
Ha prepared in this manner without chromatography.<br>
For the synthesis of compounds lib and lie which are slower to react than IVa,<br>
2 to 2.5 equivalents of di-terbutyl chloromethyl phosphate were employed and<br>
modified conditions (cesium carbonate as base with KI in the solvent, NMP) were<br>
used to alkylate either IVb and IVc and realize high conversion to lib and He<br>
respectively.<br>
Again the new conditions provided compounds II in sufficient purity to allow<br>
them to be used to produce compounds I without the need for chromatographic<br>
purification. Thus the new conditions reduce the quantities and stoichiometry of<br>
reagents needed to prepare the compound I of this invention and avoids the need for<br>
chromatographic purification of intermediates II. The starting materials employed to<br>
prepare the di-tertbutyl chloromethyl phosphate are more economical and less<br>
hazardous and the final product is produced in higher purity. Finally, the conditions<br>
developed for alkylating IVa, IVb, and IVc eliminate the need for the reactive,<br>
flammable sodium hydride base that had been used in excess and employ either<br>
potassium or cesium carbonate.<br>
hi the alkylation step, a suitable base can be used such as MCOa (M is<br>
lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium or cesium). For converting IVa to Ha,<br>
is preferred (1-5 molar equivalents, preferably 2 molar equivalents per mole of IVa).<br>
For converting IVb to lib or IVc to He, cesium carbonate is preferred.<br>
Also, a suitable solvent is needed such as dimethylsulfoxide, Ndimethylformamide,<br>
acetone, acetonitrile, N-methylpyrrolidinone, formamide,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, etc. (2-50 ml/gram of IV, with 5 ml/gram preferred);<br>
dimethylsulfoxide is preferred in converting IVa to Ila; N-methylpyrrolidinone is<br>

Preparation of azaindole, Method A: Preparation of 7-Chloro-6-<br>
azaindole le: 2-Chloro-3-nitropyridine 22e (5.0 g) was dissolved in dry THF (200<br>
ml). After the solution was cooled down to -78°C, an excess of vinyl magnesium<br>
bromide (1.0 M in THF, 100 ml) was added. Then, the reaction was left at -20°C for<br>
eight hours before being quenched with 20% NH4C1 (150 ml). The aqueous phase<br>
was extracted with EtOAc (3 x 150 ml). The combined organic layer was dried over<br>
MgSO4. After filtration and concentration, the crude product was purified by silica<br>
gel column chromatography to afford 1.5 g of 7-chloro-6-azaindole le in 31% yield.<br>

(85 g, 1.13 mol) in a SOOmL-round bottom flask was heated with stirring at 150°C<br>
(oil batli temp.) for 1.5 hrs with a gentle stream of nitrogen, removing HaS and water<br>
(about 18 mL of liquid collected) formed during the reaction. The reaction mixture<br>
was distilled under reduced pressure, collecting 60.3 g (0.726 mol, Y. 63.3%) of the<br>
title compound at 102°C / 0.35-1 mmHg as a white solid after removing a liquid<br>

Procedure: A 500 mL round bottom flask was loaded with 4-methoxy-7-chloro-6-<br>
azaindole 2e (9.1 g, 50 mmol; dried in vacud), potassium carbonate (13.8 g, 100<br>
mmol, 2 eq.), copper powder (6.35 g, 100 mmol, 2 eq.), and 3-methyl-l,2,4-triazole<br>
(83 g, 1.0 mol, 20 eq.). The solid mixture was heated to melt at 170-175°C (external<br>
oil bath temperature) under a gentle stream of anhydrous nitrogen for 12 h, by which<br>
time HPLC analysis indicated that the amount of the peak for the starting material<br>
had become 5-30% and the desired product peak becomes about 45% with isomeric<br>
by-product peak becomes 15%. As the reaction mixture cooled, MeOH (150 mL)<br>
was added slowly to the warm, stirred mixture. Upon cooling, the insoluble material<br>
(copper powder) was filtered through a Celite pad, and rinsed with methanol. The<br>
filtrate was concentrated in vacua to a thick paste which was diluted with water (1 L)<br>
and extracted with EtOAc (3xl50mL). The EtOAc extracts were dried (MgSO),<br>
filtered and concentrated to obtain about 8 g of crude residue which was crystallized<br>
by dissolving in hot CHsCN (50 mL), followed by diluting with water (100 mL) and<br>
cooling at 0°C to collect 1.45 g (12.7%) of the title compound as white solid. The<br>
filtrate was purified by C-18 reverse phase silica gel (YMC ODS-A 75 jmi) eluted<br>
with 15-30% CHsCN/PIzO. Appropriate fractions were combined and the aqueous<br>
solution after removing CHsCN by rotary evaporator was lyophilized to give<br>
additional 1.15 g of the title compound 3-81. The crude aqueous layer was further<br>
extracted with EtOAc several times. The ethyl acetate extracts were dried (MgSO4),<br>
filtered, concentrated, and crystallized from MeOH to give additional 200 mg of the<br>
title compound 3-81. The total yield: 2.8 g (12.2 mmol, Y. 24.5%); MS m/z 230<br>

5-Amino 2 methoxypyridine (50g, 0.4mol) was added to a stirring mixture of<br>
absolute ethanol (280 ml) and HBF4 (48% in water, 172 ml) and cooled to 0°C.<br>
Sodium nitrite (129g) was dissolved in water (52 ml) and added portion-wise over<br>
Ih). The stirring was continued at 0°C for 2hr, The reaction mixture was diluted<br>
with ether (1L). The solid product was collected by filtration and washed with 500<br>
ml of 50:50 EtOH/ether and subsequently several times with ether until the product<br>
was slightly pinkish in color. The pale pink solid 90g (~100% yield) was kept in a<br>
dessicator over P2Os.<br>
The same procedure was followed to perform the reaction on larger scale:<br>
(1) (200g, 1.6mol); HBF4 (688 ml); NaNO2 (116 g); EtOH (1.12 L); H2O (208 ml)<br>
The reaction was run 4 times (total 800 grams (1-80)). The product was dried over<br>
P205 for 48 hr. (only 24hr for first batch).<br>

The decomposition of the diazonium salt was run in 3 batches of:<br>
206g, 219g and 231g using 1.3L, 1.4L and 1.6L of anhydrous toluene respectively.<br>
The toluene was preheated under nitrogen to 100°C (internal temperature) in a 2L 3-<br>
neck round bottom flask provided with a mechanical stirrer. The solid was added<br>
solid portion-wise via a scoop through a powder funnel which was attached to an<br>
adapter with slight outward positive nitrogen flow. During addition, the temperature<br>
was maintained between 99-102°C (set at 100°C) and stirred vigorously. Total<br>
addition time was 60 min. for the smaller two batches and 70 min. for the last one.<br>
After the addition was finished, each stirring reaction was heated at 110°C for Ihr.<br>
The heating mantle was removed and stirring was stopped. The reactions were<br>
allowed to stand for 2hr (ambient temp achieved). Safety Note: The reaction contains<br>
BF3 so working with the reaction hot exposes vapors which caused skin irritation<br>
with some people. No incidents were noted at ambient temperature (6 different<br>
people). The hot toluene from the reaction was poured into a 4L Erlenmeyer (a dark<br>
brown oil and residue remained in the flask). The residue was washed with 50 ml of<br>
toluene and poured into the original toluene extracts.<br>
Add 1.5L of IN NaOH to toluene layer, extract and wash with ~100 ml of sat aq.<br>

The ether was concentrated on a rotovap and the residue was combined with the<br>
toluene extracts to make a homogeneous solution which is taken to next step as is.<br>
The other two runs were combined and worked up in the same way.<br>
All aqueous layers were checked by LC/MS = no product.<br>

A total of 4.6L of toluene solution containing 3-80 was placed in several sealed tubes<br>
and treated Avith 900ml of 35% HC1 at 145°C for 2hr. LC/MS showed no starting<br>
material, only 4. The toluene solution was decanted and discarded. The aqueous<br>
phase was washed with EtOAc and concentrated down to remove volatiles to afford a<br>
brown solid containing the desired fluoro-hydroxypyridine 4-80.<br>
A total of 244g of this solid was collected and taken to next step as is (it was not<br>
completely dry).<br>
Note: We have subsequently run this by decanting the toluene layer first prior to<br>
heating to reduce volumes. Same reaction was carried out using HBr (48% in H20)<br>

Compound 4-80 was dissolved in sulfuric acid (the larger amounts indicated above)<br>
at rt and then heated to 65°C. A preformed solution of fuming nitric acid and sulfuric<br>
acid (the smaller amount indicated above) was added dropwise. The temperature was<br>
kept between 65°C and 80°C (rxn is exothermic and although the bath is at 65°C,<br>
temperature goes higher, usually 75, sometimes 80°C). After the addition was<br>
complete, the reaction mixture was heated at 65°C for an additional hr. The reaction<br>
mixture was then cooled to rt and poured in a flask containing ice) (20g of ice/gr<br>
compound, evolution of gas occurred). A solid precipitated out and it was collected<br>
by filtration (1HNM" showed 4-80 and something else (discarded)).<br>
The aqueous layer was extracted with AcOEt several times (3-5) and concentrated on<br>
a rotary evaporator under vacuum to afford a solid that was triturated with ether to<br>
afford 5-80 as a bright yellow solid. A total of 117g of desired product was collected<br>
in the first crop (27% yield from diazonium salt). A portion did not crystallize: this<br>
oil was triturated with MeOH and Et2O to afford 3.6g of 5-80; another precipitation<br>
from the mother liquid afforded an additional 6.23g of the desired product 5-80.<br>

temperature, the solutions were heated at 110°C for 3hr. LC/MS showed starting<br>
material had been consumed. The reaction mixtures were allowed to cool to rt. The<br>
reaction flasks were placed in an ice bath; and then ice was added very slowly and<br>
carefully portionwise into the flask, gas evolution was due to HBr formation; the<br>
liquid and black solid that formed was poured into a beaker with ice. EtOAc was<br>
added and the mixture was then extracted several times with EtOAc. The organic<br>
layer was washed with saturated aq. NaHCOs; HaO and brine; dried over Na2SC&gt;4 and<br>
filtered. The product was dried in the pump overnight to provide 123g of 6-80 as a<br>

added slowly and cautiously. At first, foaming occurred and considerable solid was<br>
present, but this essentially dissolved as the addition was completed and the material<br>
warmed to rt. The layers were separated and the aqueous layer extracted 3 times with<br>
ethyl acetate. The organic extracts were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4,<br>
filtered and concentrated to afford ~ 50g of a black gummy solid. HPLC indicated<br>
57-58% product. To this was added CEfoCk and the solid was collected by filtration<br>
and washed with CH2C12 to afford 12.5g of product as a brown solid. The reaction<br>
was repeated on exactly the same scale and worked up in the same manner. From<br>
CH2C12 trituration there was obtained 12.4g of Precursor 2i (H'PLC ~ 97% pure).<br>

Example 5<br>
General Procedure: A suspension of IVc (0.24 g, 0.5 mmol) in anhydrous THF (4<br>
mL) under nitrogen atmosphere was treated with sodium hydride (60% oil dispersion,<br>
0.08 g, 2.0 mmol), and stirred until gas evolution ceased (approximately 5 minutes).<br>
The reaction mixture was treated with iodine (0.13 g, 0.5 mmol) and stirred for 2-3<br>
minutes followed by addition of di-tert-butyl chloromethyl phosphate (1.6 g, 6.0<br>
mmol, crude). A stream of nitrogen was allowed to pass over the reaction to facilitate<br>
the removal of much or all of the THF. The reaction mixture was stirred overnight.<br>
HPLC analysis of crude indicated starting IVc (ca. 56%) and desired adduct (ca.<br>
32%).<br>
Several crude reaction mixtures (a total of 6.7 mmol based on starting material IVc)<br>
were re-dissolved in dichloromethane, combined, concentrated in vacuo to remove<br>
any remaining THF. The residue was suspended in dichloromethane and TFA (1:1,<br>
approximately 40 mL total volume). The mixture was stirred for 1.5 - 2 hours and<br>
then solvent was removed in vacuo. The residue was suspended in dichloromethane<br>
and extracted into water (approximately 60 mL) made weakly basic with solid or<br>
aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The aqueous layer was reduced in volume by rotary<br>
evaporator if required and the solution was loaded onto a C-18 reverse phase column<br>
(approximately 80 g of C-18, YMC ODS-Aq, 50 micron) and eluted with water,<br>
followed by water containing 2.5% acetonitrile. Fractions containing pure product<br>
were pooled and organic solvent was removed by rotary evaporator. Purified product<br>
was recovered after lyophilization to give 1.00 g (1.30 mmol, 19% over 2 steps) of<br>

Phosphate ester A (45.lg, O.lmol) and chloroiodomethane B (200g, 1.14mol)<br>
were combined in 100ml of benzene and the mixture was stirred at room temperature<br>
for four hours before benzene was removed under vacuum. Then, 500ml of ethyl<br>
ether was added to the residue and insoluble solid was filtered away. Concentration<br>
of the filtrate provided di-tert-butyl chloromethyl phosphate, which was utilized in<br>
the next step without any purification.<br>
NaH (2.4g, 60% in oil) was added slowly into a suspension of IVa in dry THF<br>
(120ml) and the mixture was allowed to stir for an hour at room temperature. Iodine<br>
(5g) dissolved in dry THF (10ml) was added slowly into the stirring solution.<br>
Following completion of addition the resultant mixture was stirred at ambient<br>
temperature for an additional 15 minutes and then compound di-tert-butyl<br>
chloromethyl phosphate, obtained from step one, was added. After stirring for 16<br>
hours, the reaction mixture was poured into ice water (120ml), followed by extraction<br>
with EtOAc (3 x 300ml). The combined organic extracts were washed with water<br>
(100 ml) and then brine (100ml), dried over Na2SC4, and concentrated under vacuum<br>
to afford a residue, which was purified by silica gel chromatography (elution with<br>
EtOAc/Et3N (100/1) and then EtOAc/MeOH (100/1)) to give diester Ila in yields of<br>
70 - 80%.<br>
A mixed solution of TFA (50ml) and dichloromethane (450ml) was added<br>
into a round bottom flask containing 43.3g of diester Ila. After stirring at room<br>
temperature for 16 hours, the reaction mixture was concentrated under vaccum to<br>
offer a residue of lac which was used in further steps without any purification.<br>
The above 55g crude product lac was added to an aqueous solution of L-lysine<br>
(1.36M, 70 mL) at room temperature. The resulting suspension (pH^l.83) was added<br>
to a lysine solution (1.36 M, -40 mL) to pH 4.88. The resulting suspension was<br>
filtered through a pad of Celite. The clear light yellow filtrate (-200 mL) was mixed<br>
with acetone (200 mL) and heated to 45 °C. Acetone (1400 mL) was added over 2h at 45 °C. The clear solution was seeded and stirred at 45 °C for 2h, and slowly cooled<br>
to room temperature (5h) and the suspension stirred overnight. The white solid was<br>
collected by filtration and dried under house vac. at 50 °C over 24 h to afford 41.2 g<br>
of lab as an off-white solid.<br>
The above solid was dissolved in 1:1 water-acetone (560 mL) at 45 °C. Acetone (700<br>
mL) was added over a period of Ih at 45 °C. The clear solution was seeded and<br>
stirred at 45 °C for 2h. Slowly cooled to room temperature (5h) and the suspension<br>
stirred at room temperature overnight. The white solid was collected by filtration and<br>
dried under house vac. at 50 °C over 36 h to afford 33 g of lab as an off-white solid.<br>

comparative IH NMR integration of several different peaks, the ratio of lysine to IVa<br>
is calculated to range from 1.05 : 1 to 1.2 : 1 equivalents of lysine to parent prodrag.<br>
The salt form was determined to be a hydrate. Based on DSC (diffraction scanning<br>
calorimetry) and TGA (thermal gravity analysis), the observed water content is<br>
2.80%. Theoretical calculation for a monohydrate is 2.58%. Thus, the ratio of water<br>
to parent molecule in the hydrate could be in the range 1 : 1 to - 1.5 : 1.<br>
Example 7<br>
Preparation of crystalline Ic (free acid mono-hydrate)<br>
To a mixture of IVc (600 mg, 1.27 mmol) in anhydrous THF (10 ml) in an<br>
oven-dried round bottle flask under nitrogen at r.t. was added NaH (153 mg, 6.38<br>
mmol., dry powder, 95%), and the white suspension stirred until no gas evolution was<br>
observed. The mixture was then added I2 (375 ing, 1.48 mmol), and stirred at r.t. for<br>
3 h. To the reaction mixture was added NaH (153 mg, 6.38 mmol, dry powder, 95%),<br>
and the mixture stirred for about 5 to 10 min. The crude chloromethyl di-tertbutylphosphate<br>
(2.0 g, about 1.6 ml, 7.79 mmol) was added to the mixture, which<br>
was then stirred at r.t. for 15 h. LCMS analysis of the reaction showed a &gt;97%<br>
conversion of the starting material. After evaporation of the volatiles, the residue was<br>
added CH2C12 (10 ml), cooled in an ice-water bath, slowly added TFA (10 ml) and<br>
stirred at r.t. for 3 h. The reaction mixture was then evaporated, and the residue<br>
partitioned between CHaCla (50 ml) and H2O (50 ml). The CH2C12 layer was poured<br>
into the reaction flask that contained some undissolved brownish solid, and this<br>
mixture was extracted with a dilute aqueous NaHCOs solution (50 rnl). The aqueous<br>
mixture was purified by reverse phase preparative HPLC (solvent A: 10% MeOH—<br>

172.2 mg of the purified acid Ic was dissolved in 1 ml of H2O and then about<br>
0.3 ml of absolute EtOH (200 proof) was added. The mixture was left standing in a<br>
refrigerator (temperature about 3°C) overnight, after which time, crystalline material<br>
was observed. The mixture was then warmed to ambient temperature, diluted with<br>
H2O to a volumn of 3 mL, and then 20 mL of MeCN was added slowly. Following<br>
the completion of addition, the mixture was stirred at r.t. for 2 h and then filtered.<br>
The solid collected (90 mg) was dried in vacua, and then tinder high vacuum. This<br>
material was shown by powder x-ray studies to be crystalline; Elemental Analysis<br>

Diester lib (27g) was dissolved in a mixture of water (55ml) and acetone (55ml). The<br>
resulting mixture (pH: not determined) was stirred at 40°C for 16 hours to complete<br>
the solvolysis. To this reaction mixture was added 4M aqueous lysine solution to<br>
adjust pH to 3.51. EtOH (500 ml) was added into the solution and the flask wall was<br>
coated with some product after overnight. The clear solution was then transferred to<br>
another flask and EtOH (1500 ml) was slowly added to the reaction mixture in ~ 3h.<br>
After complete addition of ethanol, the solution was stirred at room temperature for<br>
48 hours and the resultant solid (Ibb) was collected by filtration and rinsed with<br>
ethanol. The white crystalline solid was dried under house vacuum at 55°C for 24 h<br>

NaH (2.6g, 10.3 mmol, 95% in oil, 5eq.) was added slowly into a suspension<br>
of IVc (lO.Og, 21.1 mmol) in dry THF (100ml) and the mixture was allowed to stir<br>
for 0.5 hour at room temperature. A solution of iodine (5.27g, 20.8 mmol) dissolved<br>
in dry THF (10ml) was added slowly into the stirring solution at a rate which<br>
prevented foaming or a violent reaction. The resultant mixture was stirred for an<br>

2.2 eq. (for Na, K) or 1.2 eq. (for Mg) of metal alkoxide was added into a<br>
solution of phosphoric acid in THF. After 2 hours, solvent was evaporated and<br>
MeOH was added to provide a clear solution. EtOH or iPrOH was then added into<br>
the solution until it became cloudy. Then, MeOH was added cautiously to let<br>
solution become just clear again. The mixed solution was left open to air for 16<br>
hours and resultant precipitate was collected as the salt form.<br>
Procedure C:<br>
2.2 eq. of amine was added into a solution of phosphoric acid in THF. After 2<br>
hours, solvent was evaporated and MeOH was added to provide a clear solution.<br>
EtOH or iPrOH was then added into the solution until it became cloudy. Then,<br>

The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 hours before being<br>

LC retention time 1.32min (column: Xterra 4.6x50mmC18 Sum).<br>
To the inerted reactor, di-tert-butyl potassium phosphate (1.69 kg), 4.0 eq. of<br>
sodium carbonate and 0.05 eq of tetrabutyl arnmom'um hydrogen sulfate were added<br>
through the manway. Methylene chloride(7.7 L/kg) was then pumped through the<br>
sprayball to wash down the reactor walls. With the jacket temperature below 10 °C,<br>
the exothermic water charge was added over the course often minutes (7.6 L/kg).<br>
The associated exotherm was minor with a batch temperature rising from 1 1.1 to 16.2<br>
°C over the course of the addition. With the jacket and batch temperature near 7 and<br>
15 °C, respectively, 2.0 eq. of chloromethylsulfonylchloride (CMCS) was charged via<br>
addition runnel. The charge continued for 2 hours while the jacket temperature was<br>
slowly raised to 20 °C during the charge. The maximum batch temperature during the<br>
CMCS charge was 25.3 °C. The jacket temperature was slowly raised during the<br>
charge to ensure that the exotherm started as preliminary laboratory data indicated<br>
that the exotherm may be slowed at lower batch temperatures. The reaction mixture<br>
was agitated and after 3.5 hours, an NMR sample indicated that the reaction had<br>
progressed 72%. The reaction was allowed to proceed overnight with a batch<br>
temperature between 19.7 and 23.6 °C (Delta V historian). An NMR sample taken<br>
after 16 hours indicated a reaction conversion of 76%. Laboratory batches ranged in<br>
conversion from 60 to 80%.<br>
Work-up<br>
After the reaction was deemed complete, additional water at 9.3 L/kg was<br>
added to the batch to affect a phase split. The product rich lower phase was<br>
transferred to a carboy and the upper aqueous phase was sent to waste. A small rag<br>
layer was kept with the product rich organic. The organic phase was returned to R-<br>
1A and additional water at 5.1 L/kg was added as a wash. The phases were split with<br>
the product rich organic, approximately 18.5 kg, being sent to a carboy while the<br>
upper aqueous phase was sent to waste. No rag layer or solids were observed in the<br>
second split. However, it is recommended to polish filter the product rich organic to<br>
remove precipitated salts.<br>
Methylene Chloride Distillation<br>
The product rich organic was transferred to the rotovap bowl of EVAPO-1 A.<br>
Distillation of the methylene chloride was initiated with a jacket temperature of<br>
approximately 22 °C. The distillation rate slowed after 4.5 hours and a batch sample<br>
was taken to analyze the methylene chloride content. NMR analysis indicated a 4:1<br>
ratio of di-tert-butyl chloromethyl phosphate to methylene chloride. Typical<br>
laboratory results of this stream would indicate a 10:1 ratio so the distillation was<br>
continued with an increase in the rotovap jacket temperature. After an additional 2.5<br>
hours, the distillation rate stopped. An NMR sample of the batch indicated that the<br>
ratio had increased to 5:1 di-tert-butyl chloromethyl phosphate to methylene chloride.<br>
The maximum rotovap jacket temperature was 28.4 °C.<br>
Purity of the di-tert-butyl chloromethyl phosphate oil<br>
NMR analysis of the di-tert-butyl chloromethyl phosphate oil indicated the<br>
potency to be greater than 100%. Development work typically produced material<br>
with a potency of 100 + 10%. Karl-Fischer analysis measured water content at 0.02<br>
wt% and GC analysis measured methylene chloride at 10.69 wt%. Thus, the reported<br>
potency is 89.29 wt% accounting for the methylene chloride and water contribution in<br>
the oil.<br>
Storage of di-tert-butyl chloromethylphosphate<br>
The di-tert-butyl chloromethyl phosphate oil was placed in cold room and the<br>
temperature was monitored with a stripchart recorder. Laboratory batches were<br>
typically held between 0 to 5 °C. An NMR of the product after the 104 hour hold in<br>
the cold room indicated that the material had not lost potency.<br>
(Safety testing conducted during the campaign indicates that upon holding the oil<br>
self-heats with a subsequent pressure build-up).<br>
NMR Standard Prep and Sample Prep<br>
Preparation of trimethylphosphate (TMPO standard solution:<br>
A standard solution of TMP04 should be prepared based on a 100 M%<br>
theoretical yield. For example: a 10 g input of the di-t-butyl potassium phosphate<br>
salt should yield 10.41 g (0.402 mols) of di-tert-butyl chloromethyl phosphate. The<br>
volume of dichloromethane in the reaction mixture will be 75 niL. The molarity of<br>
the solution is 0.536. A TMP04 solution should be prepared in that molarity and 0.5<br>
mL of that solution should be combined with 0.5 mL of the dichloromethane layer<br>
from the reaction. The integrals found in the 31P NMR can be directly compared and<br>
will give the % conversion of di-tert-butyl chloromethyl phosphate.<br>

To be successful, the conversion of the prodrug into parent must be initiated<br>
by alkaline phosphatases in man. Qualitative in vitro studies using human placental<br>
alkaline phosphatase and in vivo studies in rats showed that conversion of prodrug<br>
was rapid both in vitro with human enzymes and in in vivo in rats. Ideally, the rate of<br>
conversion will be rapid so that only limited exposure to prodrug occurs and<br>
maximum exposure to active parent antiviral agent will result. Data from studies<br>
(below) shows that in all three prodrug examples evaluated in rats, the prodrug is<br>
rapidly converted to active parent drug and that plasma levels of prodrug are very low<br>
in comparison to parent drug at all data points. These studies were done at doses in<br>
which doses of parent drug and the dose equivalent from phosphate prodrug were low<br>
and approximately equal, ~5mg/kg. Since the advantages of prodrugs are to<br>
overcome dissolution limited absorption, at low doses the advantages of the prodrugs<br>
over less soluble parent molecules for clinical use in patients will not be obvious.<br>
The low dose in vivo studies were used to determine if the prodrugs were generating<br>
parent molecule. The solubility of the parent molecules IV, is dependent on<br>
crystalline form. A crystalline form is preferred for drug development. The data for<br>
all of the parent molecules can be summarized by saying that the aqueous solubility<br>
of crystalline material for all the parent molecules IV is 
much less. Thus, the intrinsic aqueous solubility of the parent molecules is low and<br>
plays a major role in causing dissolution-limited absorption at higher doses.<br>

Note 1: The prodrug derivative (cone. ~0.2 mM) was incubated with alkaline<br>
phosphatase (human placenta, Sigma, ~1.4 unit) in pH 8 Tris buffer (cone. ~0.03M,<br>
ImL), and disappearance of the prodrug and formation of the parent were monitored<br>
by HPLC and LC/MS. hi most cases, the prodrug completely disappeared,<br>
corresponding with formation of the parent within an hour or two, and no other<br>
intermediate was detected.<br>
Note 2: The prodrug was administered in rats by the oral (at the dose equiv. to 5<br>
mg/Kg of the parent) or intravenous route (at the dose equiv. to 1 mg/Kg of the<br>
parent). The plasma levels indicate rapid conversion to the parent with no detectable<br>
amount of the prodrug (po).<br>
In the tables below the term "LLQ" means lower Limit of quantitation (i.e., not<br>
detected).<br>
Total AUC of parent after PO administration of Prodrug<br>
Total AUC of parent after PO administration of parent (historic data)<br>
A dose escalation study D of one of the prodrugs (lea) was carried out in rats<br>
in order to demonstrate the significant advantages of prodrugs over the parent for<br>
potential use in the treatment of HIV-1 patients after oral dosing. The exposure data<br>
and measured parameters from the prodrug dose escalation study were compared to<br>
similar data from historical studies conducted with parent molecules.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 compare the AUC (the area under the curve, a measure of<br>
exposure to drug in the rat) of IVc from oral dosing of prodrug lea (study D) to that<br>
obtained from dosing parent molecule IVc (Study E) and a rat toxicokinetic study<br>
(TK). Details for the historical IVc dose escalation (Study E) and the rat TK study<br>
(F) are shown in these figures.<br>
As can be seen from Figures 3 and 4, the AUC and Cmax of parent molecule<br>
after oral administration of the prodrug (triangles) is greater than that which resulted<br>
from administration of the parent drug in two separate studies. Clearly, the data<br>
shows that in order to maximize exposure multiples of drug in plasma, the prodrug<br>
offers a surprising advantage. Since the chemical structures of this class of molecules<br>
are similar, prodrugs of the class are expected to show enhancement in exposure from<br>
administration of prodrugs rather than parent. Given the uncertainty of improving<br>
oral exposure with phosphate prodrugs and the novelty of the new compounds, this<br>
result was not obvious and is surprising in its magnitude.<br>
W and Oral Rat PK Study Protocol of Phosphate Prodrugs Studies A,B,and C<br>
Compounds Ic (phosphate prodrug of F/c), Ib (phosphate prodrug of IVb),<br>
and la (phosphate prodrug of IVa) were administered separately to groups of three<br>
male Sprague-Dawley rats by IV bolus (1 mg/kg; all doses listed in this document<br>
were parent compound equivalent) or oral gavage (5 mg/kg). The rats for oral dosing<br>
studies were fasted overnight. Compound Ic was administered as a free acid, whereas<br>
the other two were as sodium salts. The dosing solutions of all three prodrugs for<br>
both IV and oral administration were prepared in 100% normal saline at 1 mg/mL<br>
(dosing solution concentrations were parent compound equivalent). Plasma samples<br>
were collected in EDTA vacutainers over 24 lirs, and analyzed by LC/MS/MS for<br>
both the prodrugs and parent molecules. Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed on<br>
Kinetica™.<br>
Procedures for LC/MS/MS analysis are shown in the protocols below.<br>
The results of this study are shown in Tables 2-4, middle two columns.<br>
Oral Dose Escalation Study Protocol of lea in Rats (Study D)<br>
Groups of three fasted male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally administered<br>
compound lea (disodium salt) at 4.5, 21, and 163 mg/kg (doses were FVc equivalent).<br>
The dosing solutions were prepared in water at 1, 5, and 20 mg (compound Ic (free<br>
acid) equivalent)/mL for the doses of 4.5, 21, and 163 mg (compound FVc<br>
equivalent)/kg, respectively. Plasma samples were collected in EDTA vacutainers<br>
over 24 hrs, and analyzed by LC/MS/MS for both Ic and IVc. Pharmacokinetic<br>
analysis was performed on Kinetica™.<br>
The results of this study are shown in Table 46 and Figures 3-5.<br>

Bioanalytical Methods for In Vivo Studies Analyzing for Wb<br>
This refers to method for analyzing for concentration levels of IVb in rat<br>
plasma samples (used for studies B and Bl).<br>
Quantitation of COMPOUND IVb by LC/MS/MS in Plasma. Aliquots of plasma<br>
samples from rat, dog, monkey or chimpanzee studies were prepared for analysis by<br>
precipitating plasma proteins with two volumes of acetonitrile containing the internal<br>
standard,.COMPOUND IVa. The resulting supernates were separated from the<br>
precipitated proteins by centrifugation for 10 minutes and transferred to autosampler<br>
vials. Samples were either prepared manually, or with the use of the Tomtec<br>
automated liquid handler. An aliquot of 5 \\L was injected for analysis.<br>
The HPLC system consisted of two Shimadzu LC10AD pumps (Columbia,<br>
MD), a Shimadzu SIL-HTC autosampler (Columbia, MD), and a Hewlett Packard<br>
Series 1100 column compartment (Palo Alto, CA). The column was a YMC Pro Cl 8<br>
(2.0 x 50 mm, 3 fom particles, Waters Co., Milford, MA), maintained at 60°C and a<br>
flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The mobile phase consisted of 10 mM ammonium formate<br>
and 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and 100% 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1%<br>
formic acid in methanol (B). The initial mobile phase composition was 95% A.<br>
After sample injection, the mobile phase was changed to 15% A/85% B over 2<br>
minutes and held at that composition for an additional 1 minute. The mobile phase<br>
was then returned to initial conditions and the column re-equilibrated for 1 minute.<br>
Total analysis time was 4 minutes.<br>
The HPLC was interfaced to a Micromass Quattro LC. Ultra high purity<br>
nitrogen was used as the nebulizing and desolvation gas at flow rates of 100 L/hr for<br>
nebulization and 1100 L/hr for desolvation. The desolvation temperature was 300°C<br>
and the source temperature was 150°C. Data acquisition utilized selected reaction<br>
monitoring (SRM). Ions representing the (M+H)+ species for IVb and the internal<br>
standard were selected in MSI and collisionally dissociated with argon at a pressure<br>
of 2 x 10" torr to form specific product ions which were subsequently monitored by<br>
MS2. The transitions, voltages and retention times are summarized in Table 7.<br>
The plasma standard curve ranged from 4 to 8000 ng/ml, the brain curve from<br>
1-1000 ng/ml. The curves were fitted with a quadratic regression weighted by<br>
reciprocal concentration (1/x). Standards were analyzed in duplicate. Quality control<br>
(QC) samples, prepared in blank plasma, at three concentrations within the range of<br>
the calibration curve were also analyzed in triplicate with each plasma analytical set.<br>
For this compound, the predicted concentrations of 90% of the plasma QCs were<br>
within 20% of nominal concentration, indicating acceptable assay performance.<br>
Vehicles and Formulations. Referring to Table 8, when the vehicle used contains<br>
NaOH, Compound IVc solution formulations were pH adjusted using NaOH to obtain<br>
a pH of 8.6-9.0, where the compound is partially ionized, based on it's pKa at 8.4.<br>

Quantitation of Three Pro-Drugs and their Parent Compounds by LC/MS/MS in<br>
Biological Matrices<br>
This LC/MS/MS assay was developed to investigate three pro-drug<br>
compounds and their respective parent molecules in biological matrices. The three<br>
pro-drug compounds were: Compounds la, Ic, and Ib and their other respectives<br>
salts or free acids. Note this assay is used for the free acid and salt forms of the three<br>
prodrugs as molecular ion detected is independent of salt counterion. Thenrespective<br>
parent compounds were: IVa, IVc, and IVb.<br>
The HPLC system consisted of Shimadzu LClOADvp pumps (Columbia,<br>
MD) and HTC PAL autosampler (Leap Technologies, Gary, NC) linked to a Synergi<br>
Hydro-RP analytical column (2.0 x 50 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). Mobile<br>
phase A consisted of 0.1% Formic Acid in water; mobile phase B was 0.1% formic<br>
acid in acetonitrile. LC flow rate was 0.4 mL/min into the mass spectrometer. The<br>
initial mobile phase composition was 10% B ramped to 75% B over 1.75 min, held at<br>
that composition for 0.25 min, ramped to 100% B over 0.1 min, held for 0.6 min,<br>
returned to initial conditions over the next 0.1 minute and then re-equilibrated. Total<br>
analysis time was 4 min. Retention times for all analytes ranged between 1.5 and 2.6<br>
min.<br>
The HPLC system was interfaced to a Sciex API3000 triple quadrupole mass<br>
spectrometer (Toronto, Canada) equipped with the Turboionspray source set at 450°C<br>
and ionspray voltage set to 4.5 kV. UHP nitrogen was used as nebulizer and auxiliary<br>
gases with pressures of 80 psi and 7L/min, respectively. The analysis was performed<br>
in positive ion mode. The transitions monitored for all compounds and their collision<br>
energies (CE) were: m/z 533.41 &gt; 435.24 for la (CE=19); m/z 584.46 &gt; 486.29 for Ic<br>
(CE=23); m/z 558.31 &gt; 432.13 for Ib (CE=19); 423.39 &gt; 204.96 for IVa (CE=31);<br>
474.36 &gt; 255.97 for IVc (CE=29); 448.35 &gt; 105.20 for IVb (CE=35).<br>
To accommodate a wide variety of biological sample matrices, acetonitrile<br>
precipitation was used in sample preparation. Test samples and standards were<br>
transferred to a 96 well plate using the Packard Multiprobe II (Packard Instruments,<br>
Downers Grove, IL). 200 |J,L of acetonitrile containing the internal standard (BMS-<br>
647257, 500 nM) was added to 100 pL aliquots of both test samples and standards in<br>
the 96 well plate using the Tomtec Quadra 96. The plate was then vortexed for<br>
approximately 3 minutes and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 minutes. Using the<br>
Tomtec Quadra 96, 150 [XL of supernatant was transferred from the plate to a clean 96<br>
deep well plate. 150 uL of 0.2% formic acid in water was then added to each well<br>
using the Tomtec Quadra 96 and the plate was vortexed before analysis.<br>
Standard curves at eight concentration points from 5 nM to 10 jiM were<br>
prepared from stock solutions in acetonitrile and serially diluted in matrix for both<br>
pro-drug and parent compounds. Standard curves were transferred in duplicate 100<br>
uL aliquots to a 96 well plate containing the test samples, extracted with the test<br>
samples as described above, and injected at the beginning, middle, and end of the<br>
analytical sequence. The standard curves were fitted with a linear regression<br>
weighted 1/x . Data and chromatographic peaks were processed and concentrations<br>
of standards and unknowns were quantitated using PEBiosystems Analyst™ 1.1.<br>
In Vivo Methods<br>
Conditions for Study Cl, E andF (Rat PK, MAP and TK Studies)<br>
For the IV and PO pharmacokinetic studies of compound We in rats,<br>
compound IVc was dissolved in PEG-400/ethanol (90/10) as a solution. Please refer<br>
to Table 8.<br>
Rat. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (300-350 g, Hilltop Lab Animals, Inc., Scottdale,<br>
PA) with cannulas implanted in the jugular vein and/or bile duct were used. The rats<br>
were fasted overnight in the PO pharmacokinetic studies. Blood samples of 0.3 ml<br>
were collected from the jugular vein in EDTA-containing microtainer tubes (Becton<br>
Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), and centrifuged to separate plasma.<br>
In an IV study, compound IVc was delivered at 1 mg/kg as a bolus over 0.5<br>
min (n = 3). Serial blood samples were collected before dosing and 2, 10, 15, 30, 45,<br>
60,120,240, 360, 480, and 1440 min after dosing.<br>
PO Single Dose Study Cl<br>
In the PO study Cl of Compound IVc, the rats (n = 3) received an oral dose of<br>
5 mg/kg of Compound IVc. Serial blood samples were collected before dosing and<br>
15, 30, 45, 60,120, 240, 360, 480, and 1440 min after dosing. The oral (PO) results<br>
from Study Cl are in Table 4, right most column.<br>
Oral (PO) Dose Escalation Study E<br>
In the oral dose escalation study E of Compound IVc, groups of rats (n = 2 per<br>
group) received oral doses of 25, 75, and 200 mg/kg. At 25 mg/kg, the dosing<br>
solution was in solution; at the higher doses, the dosing solutions were suspensions.<br>
Serial blood samples were collected before dosing and 15, 30, 45, 60,120, 240, 360,<br>
480, and 1440 min after dosing. Brain samples were collected at 1440 min to assess<br>
brain penetration. The brain samples were blotted dry and the wet weights were<br>
recorded. The oral (PO) results from Study E are in Table 46.<br>
2-Week Oral Dose Rat Toxicology Study F<br>
In the 2-week oral rat study F (n=six/sex/group), Compound IVc was<br>
administered at daily doses of 15, 75, or 200 mg/kg. Toxicokinetic evaluations on<br>
days 1 and 14 indicated that systemic exposures (AUCo-24h) of Compound IVc were<br>
generally dose related but were not dose proportional (see Table 5), with no evidence<br>
of autoinduction or accumulation. On Day 14, AUC0-24h values were slightly higher<br>
in females (644 |lghr/ml) compared to males (526.88 lir/ml) at dosages 200<br>
mg/kg/day. The oral (PO) results from Study F are in Table 5.<br>
Map Study G: PO and IV Dosing Study of Diester Ila in Rats<br>
Structure of Compound Ila<br>
The procedure for the oral dosing leg of MAP study Al was followed except<br>
that diester Ila was utilized in place of Compound IVa. Analysis for compound IVa<br>
showed that dosing of the diester Ila by oral route produced substantial IVa. The data<br>
is described in Table 10 below:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
A significant number of studies were done to demonstrate and characterize the<br>
surprising utility of the prodrugs I. Dose escalation exposure experiments comparing<br>
exposure of parent molecules after dosing prodrug and parent were carried out in rats<br>
and dogs for prodrugs I of parent molecules IVa, IVb, and IVc. The effect of food<br>
and dose on exposure of IVa after dosing prodrug lab or parent IVa was compared in<br>
dogs. The prodrug showed suprising ability to improve exposure and avoid effects of<br>
feed as compared to parent. Low dosage full pharmacokinetic studies (oral and IV<br>
dosing) were carried out in rats dogs and monekys for prodrugs lab, Ibb, and Icb to<br>
show conversion to parent compounds IVa, IVb,, and IVc respectively. Oral dosing<br>
studies hi rats were carried out for sprodrug le (free acid), and for parent compound<br>
IVf to demonstrate conversion and systemic exposure of parents We and IVf<br>
respectively. Data is shown above or below in this application.<br>
Additional profiling Section 1<br>
Additional Studies -with lab:<br>
lac is the free acid phosphate prodrug of the N-hydroxymemyl adduct of IVa<br>
and is hydrolyzed by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) to form IVa. lab, a mono-lysine salt<br>
of lac, was used for all of the following studies.<br>
TV and PO pharmacokinetic studies of lab were conducted in rats, dogs and<br>
monkeys, hi all cases, blood samples were collected in the presence of EDTA. The<br>
presence of EDTA, a known ALP inhibitor, minimized significant ex vivo conversion<br>
of lab during sample processing. IVa was rapidly formed following IV<br>
administration of lab. Good oral bioavailabilities (62-94%) of TVa were observed<br>
after administration of lab in rats, dogs and monkeys with very little or no lab present<br>
in plasma. Since there are high levels of ALP expression in the gut, it is likely that<br>
following oral administration of lab, lab is hydrolyzed by ALP present at the brush<br>
border membranes of the intestinal lumen to form IVa, which is rapidly absorbed due<br>
to its high permeability.<br>
In vitro incubation studies were conducted for a qualitative assessment of<br>
ALP-dependent hydrolysis of lab in different tissues. lab was hydrolyzed in the<br>
presence of serum and hepatocytes from rat, dog, monkey and human, as well as<br>
human placental ALP. On the occasions where lab and IVa were measured, the<br>
conversion of lab to IVa was near stoichiometric. Due to hydrolysis in serum, the<br>
protein binding of lab could not be determined. Based on the in vitro data, it is<br>
anticipated that lab will be hydrolyzed by human ALP and that IVa will be formed<br>
after oral administration of lab to human subjects.<br>
The crystalline solubility of lab at room temperature increases from 0.22<br>
mg/ml at pH 1.4 to &gt;12 mg/ml at pH 5.4 and pH 8.9; aqueous solutions containing<br>
&gt;100 mg/mL have been prepared for in vivo toxicology studies. In comparison, the<br>
aqueous solubility of the parent compound, IVa, at room temperature as crystalline<br>
material was determined to be 0.04 - 0.9 mg/mL (pH range of 1.5 - 10). lab exhibits<br>
acceptable solution and solid stabilities.<br>
The higher aqueous solubility of lab provides a means to overcome the<br>
dissolution-rate limited absorption of IVa below certain doses and thereby increased<br>
the exposures of IVa in oral dose escalation and toxicokinetic studies. lab, when<br>
dosed orally at ~200 mg/kg of IVa equivalent, provided 2-fold higher AUC of IVa in<br>
rats and dogs, without significant plasma exposure to the prodrug, as compared to the<br>
AUC from the historical IVa suspension studies at the similar dose. Moreover, the<br>
AUC and Cmax values of IVa in fasted dogs receiving lab dry-filled capsules (200<br>
mg/dog of IVa equivalent) were 38 and 58 times, respectively, those attained in fasted<br>
dogs given the IVa clinical capsule formulation, and 4 and 6 times, respectively, those<br>
attained in fed dogs given the IVa clinical capsule formulation.<br>
No significant differences in AUC and Cmax of IVa were observed between<br>
fasted and fed dogs receiving lab, whereas a 9-fold improvement was observed in fed<br>
dogs as compared to fasted dogs receiving IVa. These data suggest that efficacious<br>
blood levels of IVa may be achieved in HIV-infected patients without the requirement<br>
for a high fat meal. The spray dried form of IVa gave rise to similar exposure levels<br>
of IVa as that observed from lab in dogs.<br>
Single-Dose Toxicokinetic Tolerability Study in CD Rats<br>
A 1-day oral toxicokinetic study in rats was conducted using the prodrug lab<br>
(monolysine salt). lab was administered at dosages of 16, 72, and 267 mg/kg (free<br>
acid) by oral gavage to three male rats/group using water as the vehicle (solution<br>
formulation). The dosages of prodrug free acid correspond to IVa (parent) molar<br>
equivalent dosages of 13, 57, and 211 mg/kg, respectively. The endpoint evaluated<br>
was plasma toxicokinetics of lab and IVa in the individual rats.<br>
The mean toxicokinetic values are provided in Table 12.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of both lab (prodrug) and IVa<br>
(parent) was achieved within 1.1 hour post-dose. The plasma area under the plasma<br>
concentration-time curve (AUC) of the prodrug was 
rats given 
dosage, and Cmax increased in a less than dosage-proportional manner between 72<br>
and 267 mg/kg of lab.<br>
A comparison of IVa AUC obtained in rats given either IVa (2) or lab, is<br>
shown in Figure 6.<br>
Solubility in preclinical formulations has been an issue. The AUC of IVa is<br>
equivalent for both parent and prodrug at lower dosages (e.g., 
both were formulated as solutions (PEG-400 for parent and water for prodrug) but at<br>
a high dosage (e.g., 200 mg/kg) the neutral parent was formulated as a suspension<br>
whereas the prodrug salt was formulated as an aqueous solution.<br>
A 2-week rat toxicity study using dosages of 5, 50, or 500 mg/kg BID to<br>
support the IND is ongoing (3). The in-life phase of the study has been completed,<br>
and there were no noteworthy in-life observations.<br>
Single-Dose Toxicokinetic and Tolerability Study in Dogs<br>
A multi-phase study was conducted to evaluate the tolerability of the prodrug,<br>
lab (monolysine salt) at dosages of 24, 90, or 240 mg/kg (free acid, molar equivalent<br>
to 19, 71, or 190 mg/kg of parent IVa, respectively) and the toxicokinetics of lab and<br>
IVa (4). lab was administered to two female dogs/group once daily either as an<br>
aqueous solution (24 or 90 mg/kg) or dry-filled capsules (24, 90 [once and twice<br>
daily] or 240 mg/kg). The endpoints were: clinical signs, body weight, food<br>
consumption, and plasma toxicokinetics of lab and IVa. In all cases, a 1-week<br>
washout period was used between doses for all phases of the study.<br>
The plasma toxicokinetic values from the initial phase of the study are shown<br>
in Table 13.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
lab was not detected in the plasma samples. Mean maximum plasma<br>
concentration (Cmax) of IVa was achieved between 1-2 hours post-dose. When lab<br>
was given as a solution, both the Cmax and AUC increased in less than dosage<br>
proportional manner between 24 and 90 mg/kg. Emesis was observed at about 30<br>
minutes after dosing in both dogs given 90 mg/kg. The Cmax and AUC of IVa were<br>
equivalent following lab administration at 24 mg/kg using either dry-filled capsules<br>
or an aqueous solution.<br>
Other than emesis, there were no clinical signs observed, and there no effects<br>
on body weight and food consumption.<br>
To determine whether emesis could be eliminated/reduced by administration<br>
of lab as a dry-filled capsules, the next phase of the study was conducted using<br>
dosages of 90 or 240 mg/kg, and 90 mg/kg given twice 4 h apart (BE)). The<br>
toxicokinetic values are shown in Table 14.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
There was no difference in Cmax or AUC between dogs given 90 or 240<br>
mg/kg of lab administered by dry-filled capsules. Emesis was observed in Dogs<br>
#1201, #2201, and #2202 about 1 hour after dosing. The vomit was collected and<br>
assayed for lab content to estimate the amount of the total dose that was lost; the<br>
percentage of estimated total dose lost was 
#2202. Although the estimations of "dose lost" do not appear to be quantitatively<br>
consistent with the plasma AUC data, it does indicate that test article can be found in<br>
vomit within a short time after dosing. lab was detected in plasma of the dogs, 0.005-<br>
0.049 |iM at 1 hour post dose and 0.005-0.006 pM at 2 hours post dose; the prodrug<br>
was not detectable at later time points.<br>
A comparison of Wa AUC obtained in dogs given either IVa (5, 6) or lab, is<br>
shown in Figure 7.<br>
Vehicles and Formulations<br>
Summary of Formulations Used for Key PK and Safety Studies<br>
All in vivo PK studies in rats, dogs, and monkeys were performed using<br>
aqueous solutions for PO and IV dosing. Toxicology and exposure studies in dogs<br>
were performed with, aqueous solutions at dosages of 24 and 90 mg/kg and drug in<br>
capsule formulations at dosages of 24, 90, and 240 mg/kg of lab, mono-lysine salt.<br>
In the rat oral dose escalation study, lab was dosed as aqueous solutions at<br>
concentrations of 4.5, 20.0, and 73.5 mg/mL (mono-lysine salt form of prodrug). A<br>
significant improvement in AUC and Cmax of IVa, parent, after oral dosing of lab,<br>
prodrug, were observed compared to the historical data of IVa oral dosing.<br>
Drug in capsule formulations of lab at doses of 20 mg/kg of IVa equivalent<br>
were used for food effect studies in dogs. The prodrug was compared to the clinical<br>
capsule formulation of the parent compound, IVa, at 20 nig/kg. When IVa clinical<br>
capsule was dosed, a 9-fold increase in exposure was seen in dogs fed a high fat meal<br>
compared to fasted dogs. Upon dosing of the prodrug, lab, the exposure of IVa was<br>
significantly higher and as expected, the exposure was not significantly different<br>
between fasted and fed dogs.<br>
Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics Summary<br>
Summary of Findings and Interpretation<br>
lab is the phosphate prodrug of the N-hydroxymethyl adduct of IVa and is<br>
hydrolyzed by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) to form IVa. After administration of lab<br>
to animals, therefore, plasma samples were prepared from blood collected in the<br>
presence of EDTA, a known ALP inhibitor. Conversion of lab to IVa was minimal<br>
(
dog blood containing EDTA. No significant ex vivo conversion of lab is expected<br>
during sample storage (-20°C) and analysis of lab.<br>
The hydrolysis of lab was studied in animal and human in vitro systems.<br>
Since multiple ALP isoforms are widely distributed in various tissues, quantitative in<br>
vitro to in vivo correlations were not attempted (Fishman et al., 1968; Komoda et al.,<br>
1981; Moss, 1983; Yora and Sakagishi, 1986; Sumikawa et al, 1990). Therefore, the<br>
studies were limited to a qualitative assessment of ALP-dependent hydrolysis in<br>
different tissues. lab was hydrolyzed in the presence of serum and hepatocytes from<br>
rat, dog, monkey and human, as well as in human placental ALP. On the occasions<br>
where lab and IVa were measured, the conversion of lab to IVa was near<br>
stoichiometric. Due to hydrolysis in serum, the protein binding of lab could not be<br>
determined.<br>
None or very low levels of lab were detected in rat, dog and monkey plasma<br>
after oral administration of lab. IVa was rapidly formed following IV administration<br>
of lab in rats, dogs and monkeys. The W AUC conversion ratios were 1.5 in rats,<br>
0.80 in dogs and 0.70 in monkeys, suggesting good conversion from lab to IVa.<br>
Good oral bioavailabilities (62-94%) of IVa were observed after<br>
administration of lab in rats, dogs and monkeys. More significantly, the higher<br>
aqueous solubility of lab lessened the dissolution-rate limited absorption of IVa<br>
below certain doses and thereby increased the exposures of TVa in oral dose<br>
escalation and toxicokinetic studies (Tables 12-14 and Fig. 6-7). The AUC levels of<br>
IVa in fasted dogs receiving lab capsules were about 40 times the levels in fasted<br>
dogs given IVa clinical form capsules. Although a 40-fold difference is likely an<br>
over-prediction of the clinical situation, based on the development experience with<br>
IVa, lab clearly demonstrated the potential to improve the dissolution-rate limited<br>
absorption seen with parent IVa.<br>
To investigate the effect of food on the oral absorption of IVa hi dogs, lab and<br>
IVa were administered in capsules under fasting and fed conditions. No significant<br>
differences in AUC and Cmax were observed with lab, whereas a 9-fold<br>
improvement was observed with IVa upon feeding. These data suggest potential<br>
clinical benefits for HIV-infected patients, in whom efficacious blood levels of IVa<br>
may be achieved without the requirement for a high fat meal.<br>
Methods<br>
The studies described in this report used the mono-lysine salt of lab, unless<br>
stated otherwise.<br>
Quantitation of lab andWa by LC/MS/MS<br>
An LC/MS/MS method was developed for the analysis of lab and IVa in<br>
plasma samples from the animal phannacolcinetic studies as well as in acetonitrile<br>
supernatant from in vitro incubation studies. For the analysis in plasma, a Packard<br>
Multiprobe instrument was used to transfer 50 p.L of each standard, QC, and plasma<br>
sample to a clean 96-well plate for protein precipitation extraction. After the addition<br>
of 200 |iL of acetonitrile containing the internal standard We, the samples were<br>
vortex mixed and the resulting supernatant was separated from the precipitated<br>
proteins by centrifugation for 10 min. For the analysis in the supernatant generated<br>
from the in vitro studies, an equal volume of the supernatant and acetonitrile<br>
containing the internal standard was mixed. An aliquot of the above supernatant was<br>
transferred using a Tomtec automated liquid handler to a second clean 96-well plate.<br>
An equal volume of water was added, and the plate was capped and vortex mixed.<br>
The HPLC system consisted of Shimadzu LClOADvp pumps (Columbia,<br>
MD) and a HTC PAL autosampler (Leap Technologies, Gary, NC) linked to a<br>
Phenomenex Synergi Fusion-RP analytical column (2.0 x 50 mm, 5 |i; Torrance,<br>
CA). Mobile phase A consisted of 5 mM ammonium formate in water; mobile phase<br>
B was 100% acetonitrile. LC flow rate was 0.38 rnL/min. The initial mobile phase<br>
composition was 3% B, ramped to 60% B over 1.75 min and held for 0.25 min,<br>
ramped to 100% B over 0.1 min and held for 0.8 min, returned to initial conditions<br>
over the next 0.1 min, and re-equilibrated. Total analysis time was 4.0 min. The<br>
retention time for lab, IVa and We was 1.50,1.67 and 1.73 min, respectively.<br>
The HPLC system was interfaced to a Sciex API4000 triple quadrupole mass<br>
spectrometer (Toronto, Canada) equipped with the Turboionspray source set at 550°C<br>
and the ionspray voltage set to 4.5 kV. UHP nitrogen was used as nebulizer and<br>
auxiliary gas with the pressure of 80 psi and 7 L/min, respectively. The collision<br>
energies for lab, IVa and We were 21, 29 and 31 volts, respectively. Data acquisition<br>
utilized selected reaction monitoring (SPJVI). Ions representing the positive ion mode<br>
(M+H)+ species for lab, Wa and the internal standard were selected in MSI and<br>
collisionally dissociated with nitrogen and optimized collision energies to form<br>
specific product ions subsequently monitored by MS2. The SRM transitions for lab,<br>
Wa and We were m/z 533-&gt;435, 423-&gt;205 and 474-&gt;256, respectively.<br>
Standard curves ranging from 5 nM to 10 jiM were prepared from stock<br>
and seriallv diluted in matrix for both lab and Wa. Standard curves were<br>
aliquoted in duplicate, extracted with the samples, and injected at the beginning,<br>
middle, and end of the analytical sequence. The standard curves were fitted with a<br>
linear regression weighted by reciprocal concentration 1/x2. Data and<br>
chromatographic peaks were processed and concentrations of standards and<br>
unknowns were quantitated using PEBiosystems Analyst™ 1.1.<br>
In Vitro Methods<br>
(1) Stability of lab in EDTA Blood, Serum and Tris-HCl Buffer<br>
The stability of lab was studied in fresh blood and serum, from rat, dog,<br>
monkey and human (n = 2). The blood was collected in vacutainers containing<br>
KaEDTA (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The serum was collected in<br>
vacutainers containing no anticoagulant. lab was incubated at a starting concentration<br>
of approximately 10 JO.M for 60-90 min at 37°C. Serial samples were taken at the predetermined<br>
times. Aliquots of blood samples (200 |iL) were first mixed with 100 |iL<br>
of water followed by 400 of acetonitrile. The serum samples (50 |iL) were added<br>
into microtauiers containing KaEDTA (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ)<br>
followed by the addition of 100 |0,L of acetonitrile. The supernatant was analyzed for<br>
both lab and FVa by LC/MS/MS.<br>
The stability of lab was also evaluated, as described above, in Tris-HCl buffer<br>
(0.1M,pH7.5).<br>
(2) Hydrolysis of lab in the Presence of Human Placenta! ALP<br>
Solid human placental ALP was obtained from Sigma (P-3895, St. Louis,<br>
MO). A solution of 1000 units/L was prepared in Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.5).<br>
Solutions of 100 and 10 units/L were obtained by serial dilution. lab was incubated<br>
in the 10, 100 and 1000 units/L solutions (n = 2) at 37°C for 2 hr. The starting<br>
concentration of lab in the incubation was 10 µM. Aliquots of 100 [iL samples were<br>
taken at pre-determined tunes and added into KaEDTA microtainers followed by the<br>
addition of 200 \iL of acetonitrile. The supernatant was analyzed for both lab and<br>
IVa by LC/MS/MS.<br>
In Vivo Studies<br>
All blood samples (0.3 mL) were colleted in microtainers containing KaEDTA<br>
(Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and placed on chipped ice. After<br>
centrifugation, plasma was separated and stored at -20°C until analysis. The monolysine<br>
salt of lab (Form 3, Lot 1) was used for the pharmacokinetic studies. The<br>
dosing solutions of lab were prepared in either sterile water (for IV administration in<br>
dogs and monkeys) or distilled water (for all other dose administration).<br>
(1) In Vivo Studies in the Rat<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (300-350 g, Hilltop Lab Animals, Inc., Scottsdale,<br>
PA) with cannulas implanted in the jugular vein were used. The rats were fasted<br>
overnight in the PO pharmacokinetic studies. Blood samples were collected from the<br>
jugular vein.<br>
In the TV study, lab was delivered at 1.4 mg/kg (free acid, or 1.1 mg/kg of IVa<br>
equivalent) as a bolus over 0.5 min (n — 3). The concentration of the dosing solution<br>
was 1.4 mg/mL, and the dosing volume was 1 mL/kg. Serial blood samples were<br>
collected before dosing and at 2, 10, 15, 30, 45 min, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hr after<br>
dosing.<br>
In the PO study, lab was administered at 7.9 mg/kg (free acid, or 6.3 mg/kg of<br>
IVa equivalent) by oral gavage (n — 3). The concentration of the dosing solution was<br>
4.0 mg/mL, and the dosing volume was 2 mL/kg. Serial blood samples were<br>
collected before dosing and at 15, 30, 45 min, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hr after dosing.<br>
(2) In Vivo Studies in the Dog<br>
The IV and PO studies of lab were conducted in a crossover fashion in three<br>
male beagle dogs (11 ± 1.1 kg, Marshall Farms USA Inc., North Rose, NY). There<br>
was a two-week washout period between the IV and PO studies.<br>
hi the W study, lab was infused via the cephalic vein at 1.2 mg/kg (free acid,<br>
or 0.95 mg/kg of IVa equivalent) over 5 min at a constant rate of 0.1 mL/kg/min. The<br>
concentration of the dosing solution was 2.4 mg/rnL, and the dosing volume was 0.5<br>
mL/kg. Serial blood samples were collected from the femoral artery before dosing<br>
and at 5, 10,15, 30, 45 min, 1, 2,4, 6, 8 and 24 hr after dosing.<br>
In the PO study, the dogs were fasted overnight before dosing. lab was<br>
administered by oral gavage at 6.6 mg/kg (free acid, or 5.2 mg/lcg of IVa equivalent).<br>
The concentration of the dosing solution was 13.2 mg/mL, and the dosing volume<br>
was 0.5 mL/kg. Serial blood samples were collected before dosing and at 15, 30, 45<br>
min, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hr after dosing.<br>
To study the effect of food on the oral absorption of IVa after administration<br>
of lab and IVa, these two compounds were administered in capsules as solid to a<br>
group of three dogs in a cross-over fashion under overnight fasting and fed<br>
conditions. There was a one-week washout period between each study. lab was<br>
administered at 200 mg per dog (ca 20 mg/kg) of IVa equivalent; IVa was<br>
administered in a clinical capsule formulation at 200 mg per dog (ca 20 mg/kg). In<br>
the studies where the dogs were fed, the following meal was prepared: 2 slices of<br>
bacon, 2 eggs, 2 pieces of toast with butter and jelly, 4 oz. hash browns and 8 oz. of<br>
whole milk. After homogenization using a laboratory blender, the meal was equally<br>
divided into five portions and kept frozen. Before the study, the meals were thawed<br>
and each dog was fed one portion.<br>
Additional formulation studies of IVa were conducted in fasted dogs (n = 2<br>
per dose group). The dogs were administered either the clinical form or the spray<br>
dried form of IVa in capsules. The clinical capsule form of IVa was administered at a<br>
single dose of 20 mg/kg. The spray dried form of IVa was administered at 20, 75 and<br>
200 mg/kg.<br>
(3) In Vivo Studies in the Monkey<br>
The IV and PO studies of lab were conducted in a crossover fashion in three<br>
male cynomolgus monkeys (11 + 1.2 kg, Charles River Biomedical Research<br>
Foundation, Houston, TX). There was a two-week washout period between the W<br>
and PO studies.<br>
In the IV study, lab was infused via the femoral vein at 1.3 mg/kg (free acid,<br>
or 1.1 ing/kg of IVa equivalent) over 5 min at a constant rate of 0.1 mL/kg/min. The<br>
concentration of the dosing solution was 2.6 mg/mL, and the dosing volume was 0.5<br>
mL/kg. Serial blood samples were collected from the femoral artery before dosing<br>
and at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45 min, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hr after dosing.<br>
In the PO study, the monkeys were fasted overnight before dosing. lab was<br>
administered by oral gavage at 7.1 mg/kg (free acid, or 5.6 mg/kg of IVa equivalent).<br>
The concentration of the dosing solution was 14.2 mg/mL, and the dosing volume<br>
was 0.5 mL/kg. Serial blood samples were collected before dosing and at 15, 30, 45<br>
min, 1 , 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hr after dosing.<br>
(4) Data Analysis<br>
All results are expressed as mean ± SD, unless specified otherwise.<br>
The pharmacokinetic parameters of lab and IVa were calculated by Non-<br>
Compartmental Analysis using the KINETICA™ software program (version 4.0.2,<br>
InnaPhase Co., Philadelphia, PA). The Cmax and Tmax values were recorded<br>
directly from experimental observations. The AUCO-n and AUCtot values were<br>
calculated using the mixed log-linear trapezoidal summations. The total body<br>
clearance (Cl), mean residence time (MR.T), and the steady state volume of<br>
distribution (Vss) were also calculated after intravenous administration. The absolute<br>
oral bioavailability (expressed as %) was estimated by taking the ratio of dosenormalized<br>
AUC values after oral doses to those after intravenous doses.<br>
The hepatic clearance QH was calculated from the following equation using<br>
the well-stirred model:<br>
Oh x Cl'mtjn vivo<br>
C1H (mL/min/kg) =<br>
where Qh is the liver blood flow of 55, 31, 44 and 21 mL/min/kg for the rat, dog,<br>
monkey and human, respectively (Davis and Morris, 1993).<br>
The hepatic extraction ration (ER) was calculated at follows:<br>
ClH/Qh<br>

Differences were considered statistically significant at the level of P 
In Vitro Studies<br>
Stability of lab in EDTA Blood, Serum and Tris-HCl Buffer<br>
As part of the analytical assay validation, the stability of lab was studied in<br>
blood containing EDTA, which is known to be an inhibitor of alkaline phosphatases<br>
(Bowers, Jr. and McComb, 1966; Yora and Sakagishi, 1986). After incubation at<br>
37°C for 60 min, there was 12% conversion from the initial concentration of lab to<br>
IVa in the rat blood (Table 15), and less than 1% conversion in the monkey and<br>
human blood (Tables 15 and 16). There was approximately 6% conversion in the dog<br>
blood, and the percentages of conversion were similar between two different dogs, as<br>
well as in the same dog on two different test occasions (Tables 15 and 16). Under the<br>
sample storage condition of-20°C, the above small percentages of conversion<br>
observed at 37°C are not expected to introduce any significant ex vivo conversion<br>
during the analysis of lab.<br>
lab was stable in the Tris-HCl buffer at 37°C during the 60-mui study period<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
To investigate the hydrolysis of lab in the systemic circulation, lab was<br>
incubated in fresh serum (rat, dog, monkey and human) at 37°C for 90 min. The rate<br>
of hydrolysis was the most rapid in the rat serum, followed by dog, monkey and<br>
human sera (Table 18). The conversion of lab to IVa was near stoichiometric.<br>
Serum contains lower ALP activities as compared to tissues (McComb et a<br>
1979a). In addition, serum also contains ALP isoforms from tissue sources such as<br>
bone, liver and intestine, which are attributed to leakage through the blood vessels<br>
(Moss, 1983). Therefore, the hydrolysis of lab in serum was probably mediated by<br>
multiple isoforms of ALP.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Hydrolysis of lab in the Presence of Human Placenta ALP<br>
To study the hydrolysis of lab in a purified form of human ALP, lab was<br>
incubated in human placental ALP solutions at 10, 100 and 1000 units/L at 37°C for<br>
2 hr. The disappearance ti/? of lab was determined and reported in Table 19. As<br>
expected, the rate of hydrolysis was faster in the solutions with higher ALP activities.<br>
IVa was also formed accordingly (Fig. 8). This indicates that lab is hydrolyzed by the<br>
ALP derived from humans to form IVa.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
In Vivo Studies in the Rat.<br>
The pharmacokinetic parameters of lab and IVa in rats after IV and oral<br>
administration of lab are summarized in Table 20. The plasma concentration versus<br>
time profiles are shown in Figure 9. For comparison, the historical data from the<br>
pharmacokinetic studies of IVa in rats are also shown.<br>
The total body clearance (Cl) of lab following IV administration was 14<br>
rnL/min/kg, suggesting that lab is a low clearance compound in rats. The elimination<br>
half-life (ti/a) and mean residence time (MRT) after TV administration were 0.16 hr<br>
and 0.14 hr, respectively. lab was not detected beyond 2 hr. The volume of<br>
distribution of lab at steady state (Vss) was 0.12 L/kg, suggesting very limited tissue<br>
distribution. The formation of IVa from lab after IV administration was rapid; IVa<br>
was detected at the first sampling time point of 2 min (data not shown). The TV AUC<br>
ratio of IVa formed from lab vs. from the historical IVa study was 1.5 (theoretical<br>
value for complete conversion = 1), suggesting complete conversion of lab to IVa.<br>
With the exception of one sample (5 nM; Table 20), lab was not detected hi<br>
any samples after oral administration. The Tmax of IVa after oral administration of<br>
lab was 0.83 hr, which is shorter than the historical Tmax of IVa of 2.0 hr, indicating<br>
more rapid absorption of IVa following the oral administration of the prodrug. The<br>
more rapid absorption of IVa from the prodrug is likely the result of better aqueous<br>
solubility of lab as well as rapid hydrolysis of lab to form IVa in the intestine.<br>
Although the absolute oral bioavailability of IVa from lab was 62%, lower than the<br>
historical IVa data, the exposure of IVa from the lab rat oral dose escalation study<br>
was superior as compared to the historical data with TVa (Table 16 and Fig. 8).<br>
The terminal plasma concentration vs. time profiles of IVa formed from lab<br>
are similar to the historical IVa profiles.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The pharmacokinetic parameters of lab and IVa in dogs after IV and oral<br>
administration of lab are summarized in Table 21. The plasma concentration versus<br>
time profiles are shown in Figure 10. For comparison, the historical data from the<br>
pharmacokinetic studies of IVa in dogs are also shown.<br>
The Cl of lab after IV administration was 70 mL/min/kg, which is<br>
significantly higher than the liver blood flow of 31 mL/min/kg in dogs, suggestive of<br>
potential involvement of extrahepatic hydrolysis and/or other route(s) of elimination<br>
(e.g., renal excretion). The ti/2 and MRT after IV administration were 0.15 hr and<br>
0.07 hr, respectively. lab was not detected beyond 45 min. The Vss of lab was 0.30<br>
L/kg, suggesting low potential for tissue distribution. The formation of IVa from lab<br>
after IV administration was rapid; IVa was detected at the first sampling time point of<br>
5 min (data not shown). The FV AUC ratio of IVa formed from lab vs. from the<br>
historical IVa study was 0.80, suggesting good conversion of lab to FVa.<br>
lab was detected at 5 nM (LLQ) only at 15 min and 30 min in one dog after<br>
oral administration. The Tmax of IVa after oral administration of lab was 0.25 hr,<br>
which is shorter than the historical Tmax of IVa of 2.9 hr, indicating more rapid<br>
absorption of IVa following the oral administration of the prodrug. The absolute oral<br>
bioavailability of IVa from lab was 94%, higher than the historical IVa data of 57%.<br>
The terminal plasma concentration vs. time profiles of IVa formed from lab are<br>
similar to the historical IVa profiles.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
To study the effect of food on the oral absorption of IVa after administration<br>
of lab and IVa, the dogs were administered either lab or IVa in capsules under fasting<br>
and fed conditions. The study was conducted in a cross-over fashion, with a oneweek<br>
washout period between each study. No significant differences in the AUC and<br>
Cmax were observed between the fasting and fed conditions after administration of<br>
lab (Table 22), whereas a 9-fold improvement in AUC and Cmax was observed after<br>
administration of IVa with feeding (Table 23). Overall, the effect of feeding was<br>
more pronounced in dogs (Table 23) than in human subjects (Table 24) receiving<br>
IVa. This is suggestive of quantitative species differences in the effect of food on the<br>
oral absorption of IVa.<br>
The oral absorption of IVa was shown to be dissolution-rate limited in<br>
humans and animal species. The improvement of IVa exposure in humans upon<br>
feeding with a high fat meal was presumably due to the increased secretion of bile<br>
salts which facilitated the dissolution of IVa. In dogs, the lack of the effect of food<br>
on the oral absorption of IVa after lab administration suggests potential benefits in<br>
humans, for whom diet modification may not be required.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Additional capsule formulation studies were conducted in the same fasted<br>
dogs with the clinical and spray dried forms of IVa to compare with lab. As shown hi<br>
Table 25, at 20 mg/kg of IVa equivalent, similar exposure of IVa was observed<br>
following administration of lab and the spray dried form of IVa. However, lab<br>
provided significantly higher exposure of IVa as compared to the clinical form of<br>
IVa. The AUC and Cmax of IVa from the prodrug were 37 times and 45 times<br>
higher, respectively, than the values from the clinical form of IVa. The fold increase<br>
in dogs is likely an over-prediction of the clinical situation based on the experience<br>
with FVa in development (data not shown).<br>
hi the dose escalation study of the spray-dry form of IVa in dogs, the increases<br>
of AUC and Cmax from 20 mg/kg to 75 mg/kg were less than proportional to dose<br>
increase (Table 26). No significant further increases in exposure were observed from<br>
75 mg/kg to 200 mg/kg.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
time profiles are shown in Figure 11. For comparison, the historical data from the<br>
pharmacokinetic studies of IVa in monkeys are also shown.<br>
The Cl of lab after IV administration was 4.4 mL/min/kg, suggesting that lab<br>
is a low clearance compound in monkeys. The ti/2 and MRT after IV administration<br>
were 1.0 hr and 0.18 hr, respectively. The MRT reflected a more realistic estimate of<br>
the duration of lab in the plasma since the plasma concentrations of lab in the<br>
terminal phase were low (Fig. 11). lab was not detected beyond 6 hr. The Vss of lab<br>
was 0.048 L/kg, suggesting very limited tissue distribution. The formation of IVa<br>
from lab after IV administration was rapid; IVa was detected at the first sampling<br>
time point of 5 min (data not shown). The TV AUC ratio of IVa formed from lab vs.<br>
from the historical IVa study was 0.70, suggesting good conversion of lab to IVa.<br>
lab was detected at a concentration of 18 nM at 15 min in only one monkey<br>
after oral administration. The Tmax of IVa after oral administration of lab was 0.83<br>
hr, which is shorter than the historical Tmax of IVa of 2.7 hr, indicating more rapid<br>
absorption of IVa following the oral administration of the prodrug. The absolute oral<br>
bioavailability of IVa from lab was 66%, similar to the historical IVa data of 60%.<br>
The terminal plasma concentration vs. time profiles of IVa formed from lab<br>
are similar to the historical IVa profiles.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
IV and PO pharmacokinetic studies of Ibb were conducted in rats, dogs and<br>
monkeys. In all cases, blood samples were collected in the presence of EDTA. The<br>
presence of EDTA, a known ALP inhibitor, minimized significant ex vivo conversion<br>
of Ibb during sample processing. IVb was rapidly formed following IV<br>
administration of Ibb. Good oral bioavailabilities of IVb (50-310%; calculated using<br>
the historical IV AUC of IVb) were observed after administration of Ibb in rats, dogs<br>
and monkeys with very low levels of Ibb present in plasma. Since there are high<br>
levels of ALP expression in the gut, it is likely that following oral administration of<br>
Ibb, Ibb is hydro lyzed by ALP present at the brash border membranes of the intestinal<br>
lumen to form IVb, which is rapidly absorbed due to its high permeability.<br>
In vitro incubation studies were conducted for a qualitative assessment of<br>
ALP-dependent hydrolysis of Ibb in different tissues. Ibb was hydrolyzed in the<br>
presence of serum and hepatocytes from rat, dog, monkey and human, as well as<br>
human placental ALP. On the occasions where Ibb and IVb were measured, the<br>
conversion of Ibb to IVb was near stoichiometric. Due to hydrolysis in serum, the<br>
protein binding of Ibb could not be determined. Based on the in vitro data, it is<br>
anticipated that Ibb will be hydrolyzed by human ALP and that IVb will be formed<br>
after oral administration of Ibb to human subjects.<br>
The crystalline solubility of Ibb-03 at room temperature is &gt;11 mg/mL in the<br>
pH range of 1.5 to 8.7; aqueous solutions containing &gt;75 mg/mL have been prepared<br>
for in vivo toxicology studies, hi comparison, the aqueous solubility of the parent<br>
compound, IVb, at room temperature as crystalline material was determined to be<br>
0.007 - 0.19 mg/mL (pH range of 1.0 - 9.6). Ibb-03 exhibits acceptable solution and<br>
solid stabilities.<br>
The higher aqueous solubility of Ibb provides a means to overcome the<br>
dissolution-rate limited absorption of IVb below certain doses and thereby increased<br>
the exposures of IVb in oral dose escalation and toxicokinetic studies. Ibb, when<br>
dosed orally up to 200 mg/kg of IVb bmsequivalent, provided 11- and 2.6-fold (BID)<br>
higher AUC of FVb in rats and dogs, respectively, with relatively low plasma<br>
exposure to the prodrug (
suspension studies at the similar dose.<br>
Single-Dose Toxicokinetic Study in Spragne Dcnvley Rats<br>
A 1-day oral toxicokinetic study in rats was conducted by using the prodrug<br>
Ibb (monolysine salt). Ibb was administered at dosages of 19, 64, and 236 mg/kg<br>
(free acid) by oral gavage to three male rats/group using water as the vehicle (solution<br>
formulation). The dosages of prodrug free acid correspond to IVb (parent) molar<br>
equivalent dosages of 15, 51, and 190 mg/kg, respectively. The endpoint evaluated<br>
was plasma toxicokinetics of Ibb and IVb in the individual rats.<br>
The mean toxicokinetic values are provided in Table 28.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of IVb (parent) was achieved<br>
within ~l-3 hours post-dose. In rats given 
IVb was nearly proportional with Ibb dosage, and Cmax increased in a less than<br>
dosage-proportional manner between 19 and 236 mg/kg of Ibb. Ibb was detected in<br>
plasma of rats given 19 mg/kg of Ibb but at very low concentrations relative to those<br>
A comparison of IVb Cmax and AUC obtained in rats given either IVb or Ibb,<br>
is shown in Figure 12.<br>
The exposure to IVb is substantially increased following administration of Ibb<br>
compared to that achieved after dosing FVb.<br>
Single-Dose Toxicokinetic and Tolerability Study in Dogs<br>
A two-phase study was conducted to evaluate the tolerability of the prodrug,<br>
Ibb (monolysine salt) at dosages of 25, 92, or 250 nig/leg (free acid, molar equivalent<br>
to 20, 74, or 201 mg/kg of parent IVb, respectively) and the toxicokinetics of Ibb and<br>
IVb (1). On day 1, Ibb was administered to one dog/sex/group once daily in dryfilled<br>
capsules at the above dosages. A 1-week washout period was used between<br>
doses in the study. On day 8, Ibb was administered to one dog/sex/group once daily<br>
as an aqueous solution at 25 mg/kg or twice daily in dry-filled capsules at 46 or 125<br>
mg/kg BID. The endpoints were: clinical signs, body weight, food consumption,<br>
serum chemistry, hematology and plasma toxicokinetics of Ibb and IVb.<br>
The plasma toxicokinetic values from individual dogs are shown in Table 29.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
were detected in some plasma samples on days<br>
1 and 8. Mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of IVb was achieved between<br>
1-4 hours post-dose for QD dosing, and 1-2 hours post-second dose for BID dosing.<br>
At 25 mg/kg QD, equivalent Cmax and AUC of IVb was observed when Ibb was<br>
administered as either dry-filled capsules or an aqueous solution. On day 1, emesis<br>
(white, streaked with red that contained capsule remnants) was observed at about 0.5-<br>
1.25 hours after dosing in all dogs given 92 mg/kg QD (3101M, 3201F, 4101M, and<br>
4201F), which likely contributed to the flat exposure between 92 and 250 mg/kg. On<br>
day 8, emesis (white or brown) was observed within 2 hours after dosing in all dogs<br>
given &gt;46 mg/kg BID; capsule remnants were only observed in vomitus of two dogs<br>
(3101M post-first dose and 420IF post second dose). Twice-daily dosing provided<br>
greater exposure to IVb in dogs than once daily dosing.<br>
Other than emesis, there were no clinical signs observed, and there were no<br>
effects on body weight and food consumption.<br>
Despite the emesis observed in dogs, a higher IVb AUC is observed in dogs<br>
given Ibb than that in dogs given IVb. A comparison of IVb AUC obtained in dogs<br>
given either Ibb or IVb (2), is shown in Figure 13.<br>
The absolute oral bioavailability of IVb, parent compound, after<br>
administration of aqueous solutions of Ibb-03, the phosphate prodrug, ranged from<br>
50% to 310% in rats, dogs, and monkeys. These calculations are based on historical<br>
IV data. The exposure of FVb, after oral administration of aqueous solutions of the<br>
prodrug, Ibb-03, dosed up to 190 mg/kg of IVb equivalent is 3-10 fold higher in the<br>
rat oral dose escalation study as compared to the historical data with TVb. When Ibb-<br>
03 is dosed BID as drug in capsule in dogs, 2-3 fold improvement in exposure is<br>
achieved compared to historical data from pre-ECN toxicology studies with BID<br>
dosing of IVb as suspensions. The in vivo exposure data from drug in capsule<br>
formulations suggests that oral exposure of IVb in humans could be significantly<br>
improved by administration of traditional solid oral dosage forms of Ibb.<br>
Ibb is the phosphate prodrug of the N-hydroxymethyl adduct of IVb and is<br>
hydrolyzed by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) to form IVb. After administration of Ibb<br>
to animals, therefore, plasma samples were prepared from blood collected iri the<br>
presence of EDTA, a known ALP inhibitor. Conversion of Ibb to IVb was minimal<br>
(
ex vivo conversion of Ibb is expected during sample storage (-20°C) and analysis of<br>
Ibb.<br>
The hydrolysis of Ibb was studied in animal and human in vitro systems.<br>
Since multiple ALP isoforms are widely distributed in various tissues, quantitative in<br>
vitro to in vivo correlations were not attempted (Fishman et al., 1968; Komoda et al.,<br>
1981; Moss, 1983; Yora and Sakagishi, 1986; Sumikawa et al., 1990). Therefore, the<br>
studies were limited to a qualitative assessment of ALP-dependent hydrolysis in<br>
different tissues. Ibb was hydrolyzed in the presence of serum (rat, dog, monkey and<br>
human), hepatocytes (rat, dog and human) as well as in human placental ALP. No<br>
turnover was observed in monkey hepatocytes. The conversion of Ibb to IVb was<br>
near stoichiometric. Due to hydrolysis in serum, the protein binding of Ibb could not<br>
be determined.<br>
Ibb was completely hydrolyzed to form IVb in Caco-2 cells and, as expected,<br>
very low levels of Ibb were detected in rat, dog and monkey plasma after oral<br>
administration of Ibb. These data are consistent with reports describing the high<br>
levels of ALP expression in the gut (McComb et al, 1979a; Butterworth, 1983). The<br>
membrane-bound ALP is mostly localized in the brush border membranes of the<br>
microvilli lining the intestinal lumen (Butterworth, 1983; Testa and Mayer, 2003). It<br>
is likely that following oral administration of Ibb, Ibb is hydrolyzed by ALP present at<br>
the brush border membranes of the intestinal lumen to form IVb, which is rapidly<br>
absorbed due to its high permeability.<br>
Although different isoforms of ALP exist in different tissues and species, the<br>
substrate specificity for ALP is relatively broad (Heimbach et al., 2003), which is<br>
consistent with the above findings for Ibb.<br>
IVb was rapidly formed following IV administration of Ibb in rats, dogs and<br>
monkeys. The IV AUC conversion ratios were 0.62 in rats, 1.6 in dogs and 1.7 in<br>
monkeys, suggesting satisfactory to good conversion from Ibb to IVb.<br>
Good oral bioavailabilities (50-310%; calculated using the historical IV AUC<br>
of IVb) of IVb were observed after administration of Ibb in rats, dogs and monkeys.<br>
More significantly, the higher aqueous solubility of Ibb lessened the dissolution-rate<br>
limited absorption of IVb and thereby increased the exposures of IVb in oral dose<br>
escalation and toxicokinetic studies as compared to the exposures from the historical<br>
IVb studies (Discovery Toxicology section Tables 28-29 and Fig. 12-13).<br>
Methods<br>
The studies described in this report used the mono-lysine salt of Ibb.<br>
Quantitation of Ibb and IVb by L C/MS/MS<br>
An LC/MS/MS method was developed for the analysis of Ibb and IVb in<br>
plasma samples from the animal pharmacokinetic studies as well as in acetonitrile<br>
supernatant from in vitro incubation studies. For the analysis in plasma, a Packard<br>
Multiprobe instrument was used to transfer 50 of each standard, QC, and plasma<br>
sample to a clean 96-well plate for protein precipitation extraction. After the addition<br>
of 200 [4.L of acetonitrile containing the internal standard We, the samples were<br>
vortex mixed and the resulting supernatant was separated from the precipitated<br>
proteins by centrifugation for 10 min. For the analysis in the supernatant generated<br>
from the in vitro studies, an equal volume of the supernatant and acetonitrile<br>
containing the internal standard was mixed. An aliquot of the above supernatant was<br>
transferred using a Tomtec automated liquid handler to a second clean 96-well plate.<br>
An equal volume of water was added, and the plate was capped and vortex mixed.<br>
The HPLC system consisted of Shimadzu LClOADvp pumps (Columbia,<br>
MD) and a HTC PAL autosampler (Leap Technologies, Gary, NC) linked to a<br>
Phenomenex Synergi Fusion-RP analytical column (2.0 x 50 mm, 5 |i; Torrance,<br>
CA). Mobile phase A consisted of 5 mM ammonium formate in water; mobile phase<br>
B was 100% acetonitrile. LC flow rate was 0.38 mL/min. The initial mobile phase<br>
composition was 2% B, ramped to 50% B over 1.8 min and held for 0.5 min, ramped<br>
to 100% B over 0.1 min and held for 0.5 min, returned to initial conditions over the<br>
next 0.1 min, and re-equilibrated. Total analysis time was 4.0 min. The retention<br>
time for Ibb, IVb and IVc was 1.42, 2.21 and 1.73 min, respectively.<br>
The HPLC system was interfaced to a Sciex API4000 triple quadrupole mass<br>
spectrometer (Toronto, Canada) equipped with the Turboionspray source set at 550°C<br>
and the ionspray voltage set to 4.5 kV. UHP nitrogen was used as nebulizer and<br>
auxiliary gas with the pressure of 80 psi and 7-L/min, respectively. The collision<br>
energies for Ibb, IVb and IVc were 19, 25 and 29 volts, respectively. Data acquisition<br>
utilized selected reaction monitoring (SRM). Ions representing the positive ion mode<br>
(M+H) species for Ibb, IVb and the internal standard were selected in MSI and<br>
collisionally dissociated with nitrogen and optimized collision energies to form<br>
specific product ions subsequently monitored by MS2. The SRM transitions for Ibb,<br>
IVb and IVc were 777/2 558-&gt;432, 448-&gt;202 and 474-&gt;256, respectively.<br>
Standard curves ranging from 5 nM to 10 |iM were prepared from stock<br>
solutions and serially diluted in matrix for both Ibb and IVb. Standard curves were<br>
aliquoted in duplicate, extracted with the samples, and injected at the beginning,<br>
middle, and end of the analytical sequence. The standard curves were fitted with a<br>
linear regression weighted by reciprocal concentration 1/x2. Data and<br>
chromatographic peaks were processed and concentrations of standards and<br>
unknowns were quantitated using PEBiosystems Analyst™ 1.1.<br>
In Vitro Methods<br>
(1) Stability of Ibb in EDTA Blood, Serum and Tris-HCl Buffer<br>
The stability of Ibb was studied in fresh blood and serum from rat, dog,<br>
monkey and human (n — 2). The blood was collected in vacutainers containing<br>
KiEDTA (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The serum was collected in<br>
vacutainers containing no anticoagulant. Ibb was incubated at a starting<br>
concentration of approximately 15 for 90 min at 37°C. Serial samples were taken<br>
at the pre-determined times. Aliquots of blood samples (200 ^iL) were first mixed<br>
with 100 jiL of water followed by 400 uJL of acetonitrile. The serum samples (50 <br>
were added into microtainers containing KEDTA (Becton Dickinson, Franklin<br>
Lakes, NJ) followed by the addition of 100 pL of acetonitrile. The supernatant was<br>
analyzed for both Ibb and IVb by LC/MS/MS.<br>
The stability of Ibb was also evaluated, as described above, in Tris-HCl buffer<br>
(0.1M,pH7.5).<br>
(2) Hydrolysis of Ibb in the Presence of Human Placenta! ALP<br>
Solid human placental ALP was obtained from Sigma (P-3895, St. Louis,<br>
MO). A solution of 1000 units/L was prepared in Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.5).<br>
Solutions of 100 and 10 units/L were obtained by serial dilution. Ibb was incubated<br>
in the 10, 100 and 1000 units/L solutions (n = 2) at 37°C for 2 hr. The starting<br>
concentration of Ibb in the incubation was 10 pM. Aliquots of 100 |jJL samples were<br>
taken at pre-determined times and added into KaEDTA microtainers followed by the<br>
addition of 200 jiL of acetonitrile. The supernatant was analyzed for both Ibb and<br>
IVbbyLC/MS/MS.<br>
In Vivo Studies<br>
All blood samples (0.3 rnL) were colleted in microtainers containing<br>
K^EDTA (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and placed on chipped ice. After<br>
centrifugation, plasma was separated and stored at -20°C until analysis. The monolysine<br>
salt of Ibb (Form 3) was used for the pharmacokinetic studies. The dosing<br>
solutions of Ibb were prepared in either sterile water (for IV administration in dogs<br>
and monkeys) or distilled water (for all other dose administration).<br>
(1) In Vivo Studies in the Rat<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (300-350 g, Hilltop Lab Animals, Inc., Scottsdale,<br>
PA) with cannulas implanted in the jugular vein were used. The rats were fasted<br>
overnight in the PO pharmacolcinetic studies. Blood samples were collected from the<br>
jugular vein.<br>
hi the IV study, Ibb was delivered at 1.3 mg/lcg (free acid, or 1.0 mg/kg of FVb<br>
equivalent) as a bolus over 0.5 min (n = 3). The concentration of the dosing solution<br>
was 1.3 mg/mL, and the dosing volume was 1 mL/lcg. Serial blood samples were<br>
collected before dosing and at 2, 10, 15, 30, 45 min, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hr after<br>
dosing.<br>
In the PO study, Ibb was administered at 6.6 mg/kg (free acid, or 5.2 mg/kg of<br>
IVb equivalent) by oral gavage (n = 3). The concentration of the dosing solution was<br>
1.3 mg/mL, and the dosing volume was 5 mL/kg. Serial blood samples were<br>
collected before dosing and at 15, 30, 45 min, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hr after dosing.<br>
(2) In Vivo Studies in the Dog<br>
The IV and PO studies of Ibb were conducted in male beagle dogs (10 + 0.78<br>
kg, Marshall Farms USA Inc., North Rose, NY). Three dogs were used in each study.<br>
Of the three dogs, two same dogs were used for both IV and PO studies. There was a<br>
two-week washout period between the IV and PO studies.<br>
In the IV study, Ibb was infused via the cephalic vein at 1.3 mg/kg (free acid,<br>
or 1.0 mg/kg of IVb equivalent) over 5 min at a constant rate of 0.1 mL/kg/min. The<br>
concentration of the dosing solution was 2.6 mg/mL, and the dosing volume was 0.5<br>
mL/kg. Serial blood samples were collected from the femoral artery before dosing<br>
and at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45 min, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hr after dosing.<br>
hi the PO study, the dogs were fasted overnight before dosing. Ibb was<br>
administered by oral gavage at 7.0 mg/kg (free acid, or 5.6 mg/kg of IVb equivalent).<br>
The concentration of the dosing solution was 7.0 mg/mL, and the dosing volume was<br>
1 mL/kg. Serial blood samples were collected before dosing and at 15, 30,45 min, 1,<br>
2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hr after dosing.<br>
(3) In Vivo Studies in the Monkey<br>
The IV and PO studies of ]bb were conducted in a crossover fashion in three<br>
male cynomolgus monkeys (9.9 ± 2.4 kg, Charles River Biomedical Research<br>
Foundation, Houston, TX). There was a two-week washout period between the IV<br>
andPO studies.<br>
hi the IV study, Ibb was infused via the femoral vein at 1.3 mg/kg (free acid,<br>
or 1.1 mg/kg of PVb equivalent) over 5 min at a constant rate of 0.1 mL/kg/min. The<br>
concentration of the dosing solution was 2.7 mg/mL, and the dosing volume was 0.5<br>
mL/kg. Serial blood samples were collected from the femoral artery before dosing<br>
and at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45 min, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hr after dosing.<br>
In the PO study, the monkeys were fasted overnight before dosing. Ibb was<br>
administered by oral gavage at 5.8 mg/kg (free acid, or 4.7 mg/kg of FVb equivalent).<br>
The concentration of the dosing solution was 5.8 mg/rnL, and the dosing volume was<br>
1 mL/kg. Serial blood samples were collected before dosing and at 15, 30, 45 min, 1,<br>
2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hr after dosing.<br>
(4) Data Analysis<br>
All results are expressed as mean ± SD, unless specified otherwise.<br>
The pharmacokinetic parameters of Ibb and IVb were calculated by Non-<br>
Compartmental Analysis using the KTNETICA™ software program (version 4.0.2,<br>
InnaPhase Co., Philadelphia, PA). The Cmax and Tmax values were recorded<br>
directly from experimental observations. The AUCo-n and AUCtot values were<br>
calculated using the mixed log-linear trapezoidal summations. The total body<br>
clearance (Cl), mean residence time (MRT), and the steady state volume of<br>
distribution (Vss) were also calculated after intravenous administration. The absolute<br>
oral bioavailability (expressed as %) was estimated by taking the ratio of dosenormalized<br>
AUC values after oral doses to those after intravenous doses.<br>
The in vitro intrinsic clearance of Ibb in hepatocytes (Cljnt) was calculated as<br>
follows:<br>
Cljnt (M-L/min/million cells) = Rate / CE<br>
where Rate is the rate of metabolism in hepatocytes (pmol/min/million cells), and CE<br>
is the concentration of Ibb in the incubation.<br>
where % is 40, 32, 30 and 26 g liver/kg body weight for the rat, dog, monkey and<br>
human, respectively (Davis and Morris, 1993).<br>
The hepatic clearance QH was calculated from the following equation using<br>
the well-stirred model:<br>
C1H (mL/min/kg) n<br>
where Qh is the liver blood flow of 55, 31, 44 and 21 rnL/min/kg for the rat, dog,<br>
monkey and human, respectively (Davis and Morris, 1993).<br>
The hepatic extraction ration (ER) was calculated at follows:<br>
j Student's t-test was used for statistical analysis (Microsoft Excel, Redmond, WA).<br>
Differences were considered statistically significant at the level of P 
In Vitro Studies<br>
Stability of Ibb in EDTA Blood, Serum and Tris-PICl Buffer<br>
As part of the analytical assay validation, the stability of Ibb was studied in<br>
blood containing EDTA, which is known to be an inhibitor of ALP (Bowers, Jr. and<br>
McComb, 1966; Yora and Sakagishi, 1986). After incubation at 37°C for 90 min,<br>
there was less than 2% conversion of Ibb to IVb in blood containing EDTA and in the<br>
presence of Tris-HCl buffer (Tables 30 and 31). The above small percentages of<br>
conversion observed at 37°C indicate that conversion under the sample storage<br>
conditions (-20°C) is unlikely. Therefore, relatively minimal ex vivo conversion to<br>
IVb is expected during the analysis of Ibb.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
To investigate the hydrolysis oflbb in the systemic circulation, Ibb was<br>
incubated in fresh serum (rat, dog, monkey and human) at 37°C for 90 min. The rate<br>
of hydrolysis was most rapid in the monkey serurn, followed by human, dog and rat<br>
sera (Table 3). The conversion oflbb to .IVb was near stoichiometric.<br>
Serum contains lower ALP activities as compared to tissues (McComb et al,<br>
1979a). hi addition, serum also contains ALP isoforms from tissue sources such as<br>
bone, liver and intestine, as a result of enzyme leakage through the blood vessels<br>
 (Moss, 1983). Therefore, the hydrolysis of Ibb in serum was probably mediated by<br>
multiple isoforms of ALP.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
To study the hydrolysis of Ibb in a purified form of human ALP, Ibb was<br>
incubated at 37°C (2 hr) with solutions containing human placental ALP (10, 100 and<br>
1000 units/L). The disappearance ti/2 of Ibb was determined (Table 4). As expected,<br>
the rate of hydrolysis was faster in the solutions with higher ALP activities. IVb was<br>
also formed accordingly (Fig. 1 4). This indicates that Ibb is hydrolyzed by the ALP<br>
derived from humans to form IVb.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The pharmacokinetic parameters of Ibb and TVb in rats after IV and oral<br>
administration of Ibb are summarized in Table 34. The plasma concentration versus<br>
time profiles are shown in Figure 15. For comparison, the historical data from the<br>
pharmacokinetic studies of IVb in rats are also shown.<br>
The total body clearance (Cl) of Ibb following IV administration was 19<br>
mL/min/kg, suggesting that Ibb is a low to moderate clearance compound in rats. The<br>
elimination half-life (ti/2) and mean residence time (MRT) after IV administration<br>
were 0.18 hr and 0.079 hr, respectively. lab was not detected beyond 2 hr. The<br>
volume of distribution of Ibb at steady state (Vss) was 0.10 L/kg, suggesting very<br>
limited tissue distribution. The formation of IVb from Ibb after IV administration<br>
was rapid; IVb was detected at the first sampling time point of 2 min (data not<br>
shown). The IV AUC ratio of IVb formed from Ibb vs. from the historical IVb study<br>
was 0.62 (theoretical value for complete conversion = 1), indicating satisfactory<br>
conversion of Ibb to IVb in rats after IV dosing.<br>
Ibb was detected (
administration. The Tmax of IVb after oral administration of Ibb was 0.83 hr, which<br>
is shorter than the historical Tmax of IVb of 4.7 hr, indicating more rapid absorption<br>
of IVb following the oral administration of the prodrug. The more rapid absorption<br>
of IVb from the prodrug is likely the result of better aqueous solubility of Ibb as well<br>
as rapid hydrolysis of Ibb to form IVb in the intestine. The absolute oral<br>
bioavailability of IVb from Ibb was 50%, similar to the historical IVb value of 60%<br>
(Table 34). Moreover, the exposure of IVb from the Ibb rat oral dose escalation study<br>
was superior as compared to the historical data with IVb (Table 31 and Fig. 14).<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
time profiles are shown in Figure 16. For comparison, the historical data from the<br>
pharmacokinetic studies of IVb in dogs are also shown.<br>
The Cl of Ibb after IV administration was 27 mL/min/kg, similar to the liver<br>
blood flow of 31 mL/min/kg in dogs, suggesting that Ibb is a high clearance<br>
compound in dogs. The t\/2 and MRT after IV administration were 0.83 hr and 0.21<br>
hr, respectively. The MRT reflected a more realistic estimate of the duration of Ibb in<br>
the plasma since the plasma concentrations of Ibb in the terminal phase were low<br>
(Fig. 3). Ibb was not detected beyond 4 hr. The Vss of Ibb was 0.35 L/kg, suggesting<br>
limited tissue distribution. The formation of IVb from Ibb after IV administration<br>
was rapid; FVb was detected at the first sampling time point of 5 min (data not<br>
shown). The IV AUC ratio of IVb formed from Ibb vs. from the historical IVb study<br>
was 1.6, suggesting complete conversion of Ibb to IVb in dogs after IV<br>
administration.<br>
Ibb was detected (Cmax - 0.034 nM) in plasma samples at early time points<br>
(up to 2 hr in one dog) following oral administration. The Tmax of IVb after oral<br>
administration of Ibb was 0.40 hr, similar to the historical Tmax of IVb of 0.50 hr.<br>
The absolute oral bioavailability of IVb from Ibb was 310%, similar to the historical<br>
IVb data of 179%. Moreover, the exposure of IVb from the Ibb dog tolerability study<br>
(dose escalation) was greater when compared to the historical data with IVb (Table<br>
3 land Fig. 15).<br>
The terminal plasma concentration vs. time profiles of IVb formed from Ibb<br>
are similar to the historical IVb profiles (Fig. 16).<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
versus time profiles are shown in Figure 17. For comparison, the historical data from<br>
the pharmacokinetic studies of IVb in monkeys are also shown.<br>
The Cl of Ibb after IV administration was 28 mL/min/kg, suggesting that Ibb<br>
is a moderate to high clearance compound in monkeys. The ty2 and MRT after IV<br>
administration were 0.10 hr and 0.093 hr, respectively. The Vss of Ibb was 0.15<br>
L/kg, suggesting very limited tissue distribution. The formation of IVb from Ibb<br>
after IV administration was rapid; FVb was detected at the first sampling time point of<br>
5 min (data not shown). The IV AUC ratio of IVb formed from Ibb vs. from the<br>
historical IVb study was 1.7, suggesting complete conversion of Ibb to IVb in<br>
monkeys after IV dosing.<br>
Ibb was not detected (LLQ = 5 nM) in any plasma samples after oral<br>
administration. The Tmax of IVb after oral administration of Ibb was 1.5 hr, similar<br>
to the historical Tmax of IVb of 2.5 hr. The absolute oral bioavailability of IVb from<br>
Ibb was 187%, which is higher that the historical IVb data of 49% (Table 36).<br>
The terminal plasma concentration vs. time profiles of IVb formed from Ibb<br>

Additional Studies with Prodrug Icb<br>
Single-Dose Toxicokinetic Toler ability Study in CD Rats<br>
A 1-day oral toxicokinetic study in rats was conducted using the prodrug Icb<br>
(disodium salt). Icb was administered at dosages of 5, 25, and 200 mg/kg (free acid)<br>
by oral gavage to three male rats/group using water as the vehicle (solution<br>
formulation). The dosages of prodrug free acid correspond to IVc (parent) molar<br>
equivalent dosages of 4.5, 21, and 163 mg/kg, respectively. The endpoint evaluated<br>
was plasma toxicokinctics of Icb and IVc in the individual rats.<br>
The mean toxicokinetic values are provided in Table 37.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of IVc (parent) was achieved<br>
within ~1.7 hour post-dose. In rats given 
IVc was nearly proportional with Icb dosage, and Cmax increased in a less than<br>
dosage-proportional manner between 25 and 200 mg/kg of Icb. Icb was not detected<br>
in plasma of rats given 
|iM) were detected in plasma of rats given 200 mg/kg of Icb at a few time points.<br>
A comparison of IVc AUC obtained in rats given either IVc (1) or Icb, is<br>
shown in Figure 18.<br>
The AUC of IVc is similar after administration of either parent or prodrag at<br>
lower dosages (e.g., 
400/ethanol/0.1N NaOH for parent and water for prodrug) but at a high dosage (e.g.,<br>
200 mg/kg) the neutral parent can only be formulated as a suspension whereas the<br>
prodrug salt can be formulated as an aqueous solution, which provides superior<br>
exposure of IVc.<br>
Single-Dose Toxicokinetic and Tolerability Study in Dogs<br>
A two-phase study was conducted to evaluate the tolerability of the prodrug,<br>
Icb (monotromethamine salt) at dosages of 25, 92, or 250 mg/kg (free acid, molar<br>
equivalent to 20, 75, or 203 mg/kg of parent IVc, respectively) and the toxicokinetics<br>
of Icb and IVc (2). On day 1, Icb was administered to one dog/sex/group once daily<br>
in dry-filled capsules at the above dosages. A 1-week washout period was used<br>
between doses in the study. On day 8, Icb was administered to one dog/sex/group<br>
once daily as an aqueous solution at 25 mg/kg or twice daify in dry-filled capsules at<br>
46 or .125 mg/kg BID. The endpoints were: clinical signs, body weight, food<br>
consumption, serum chemistry, hcmatology and plasma toxicokinetics of Icb and IVc.<br>
The plasma toxicoldnetic values from individual dogs are shown in Table 38.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Low levels (
and 8. Mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of IVc was achieved between<br>
1-2 hours post-dose for QD dosing, and 1-2 hours post-second dose for BID dosing.<br>
At 25 mg/kg QD, equivalent Cmax and AUC of IVc was observed when Icb was<br>
administered as either dry-filled capsules or an aqueous solution. On day 1, emesis<br>
(white or brown, streaked with red that contained capsule remnants) was observed at<br>
about 1-1.25 hours after dosing in dogs given 92 mg/kg QD (3101M, 4101M, and<br>
4201F), which likely contributed to the flat exposure between 92 and 250 mg/kg. On<br>
day 8, emesis was observed within 2 hours after dosing in both dogs given 125 mg/kg<br>
BID but with different results. Animal 4101M had substantial exposure despite<br>
emesis, consistent with the absence of capsule remnant in the vomitus.<br>
Only low levels (
days 1 and 8.<br>
Other than emesis, there were no clinical.signs observed, and there were no<br>
effects on body weight and food consumption.<br>
Despite the emesis observed in dogs, a higher IVc AUC is observed in dogs<br>
given Icb than that in dogs given IVc. A comparison of IVc AUC obtained in dogs<br>
given either Icb or .IVc (3, 4), is shown in Figure 19.<br>
Vehicles and Formulations<br>
Summary of Formulations Used for Key PK and Safety Studies<br>
All in vivo PK studies in rats, dogs, and monkeys were performed using<br>
aqueous solutions for PO and IV dosing. Prc-ECN toxicology studies in dogs were<br>
performed with aqueous solutions prepared at 20 mg/kg IVc equivalent dose and as<br>
drug in capsule formulations at doses of 20, 75, and 203 mg/kg of IVc equivalents.<br>
In rat oral dose escalation study, Icb-03 was dosed as aqueous solutions at<br>
doses of 4.5, 21, and 163 mg/kg of IVc equivalents. Significant improvements in<br>
AUC and Cmax of IVc, parent compound, after oral dosing of Icb, the prodrug, were<br>
observed compared to the historical data after IVc oral dosing.<br>
Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics Summary<br>
Summary of Findings and Interpretation<br>
Icb is the phosphate prodrug of the N-hydroxymethyl adduct of IVc and is<br>
hydrolyzed by alkaline phospbatase (ALP) to form IVc. After administration of Icb<br>
to animals, therefore, plasma samples were prepared from blood collected in the<br>
presence of EDTA, a known ALP inhibitor. Conversion of Icb to IVc was minimal<br>
(
ex vivo conversion of Icb is expected during sample storage (-20°C) and analysis of<br>
Icb.<br>
The hydrolysis of Icb was studied in animal and human in vitro systems.<br>
Since multiple ALP isoforms are widely distributed in various tissues, quantitative in<br>
vitro to in vivo correlations were not attempted (Fishman et a!., 1968; Komoda et al.,<br>
1981; Moss, 1983; Yora and Sakagishi, 1986; Sumikawa et al., 1990). Therefore, the<br>
studies were limited to a qualitative assessment of ALP-dependent hydrolysis in<br>
different tissues. Icb was hydrolyzed in the presence of serum (rat, dog, monkey and<br>
human), hepatocytes (rat, dog and human) as well as in human placental ALP. No<br>
turnover was observed in monkey hepatocytes. The conversion of Icb to IVc was<br>
near stoichiometric. Due to hydrolysis in serum, the protein binding of Icb could not<br>
be determined.<br>
IVc was rapidly formed following IV administration of Icb in rats, dogs and<br>
monkeys. The IV AUC conversion ratios were 1.0 in rats, 0.67 in dogs and 0.90 in<br>
monkeys, suggesting good conversion from Icb to IVc.<br>
Good oral bioavailabilities (80-122%) of IVc were observed after<br>
administration of Icb in rats, dogs and monkeys. More significantly, the higher<br>
aqueous solubility of Icb lessened the dissolution-rate limited absorption of IVc<br>
below certain doses and thereby increased the exposures of IVc in oral dose<br>
escalation and toxicokinetic studies as compared to the exposures from the historical<br>
IVc studies.<br>
Methods<br>
The studies described in this report used the monotromethamine salt of Icb,<br>
unless stated otherwise.<br>
Quantitation of Icb and We by LC/MS/MS<br>
An LC/MS/MS method was developed for the analysis of Icb and IVc in<br>
plasma samples from the animal pharmacokinetic studies as well as in acetonitrile<br>
supernatant from in vitro incubation studies. For the analysis in plasma, a Packard<br>
Multiprobe instrument was used to transfer 50 pL of each standard, QC, and plasma<br>
sample to a clean 96-well plate for protein precipitation extraction. After the addition<br>
of 200 (J,L of acetonitrile containing the internal standard Compound X below, the<br>
samples were vortex mixed and the resulting supernatant was separated from the<br>
precipitated proteins by centrifugation for 10 min. For the analysis in the supernatant<br>
generated from the in vitro studies, an equal volume of the supernatant and<br>
acetonitrile containing the internal standard was mixed. An aliquot of the above<br>
supernatant was transferred using a Tomtec automated liquid handler to a second<br>
clean 96-well plate. An equal volume of water was added, and the plate was capped<br>
and vortex mixed.<br>
Compound X<br>
4-methoxy-3-(2-oxo-2-(4-(quinazolin-4-yl)piperazin-1-yl)acetyI)-1/-/-<br>
pyrrolo[2,3-c]pyridine-7-carboxamide<br>
The BPLC system consisted of Shimadzu LClOADvp pumps (Columbia,<br>
MD) and a HTC PAL autosampler (Leap Technologies, Gary, NC) linked to a<br>
Phenomenex Synergi Fusion-RP analytical column (2.0 x 50 mm, 5 u,; Torrance, CA).<br>
Mobile phase A consisted of 5 mM ammonium formate in water; mobile phase B was<br>
100% acetonitrile. LC flow rate was 0.4 mL/min. The initial mobile phase<br>
composition was 3% B, ramped to 60% B over 1.75 min and held for 0.5 min,<br>
tn 100% R nver 0.1 min and held for 0.5 min. returned to initial conditions<br>
over the next 0.1 min, and re-equilibrated. Total analysis time was 4.0 rnin. The<br>
retention time for Icb, IVc and Compound X was 1.2, 1.7 and 1.6 min, respectively.<br>
The HPLC system was interfaced to a Sciex AP14000 triple quadrupole mass<br>
spectrometer (Toronto, Canada) equipped with the Turboionspray source set at 550°C<br>
and the ionspray voltage set to 4.5 kV. UHP nitrogen was used as nebulizer and<br>
auxiliary gas with the pressure of 80 psi and 7 L/min, respectively. The collision<br>
energies for Icb, IVc and Compound X were 23, 29 and 37 volts, respectively. Data<br>
acquisition utilized selected reaction monitoring (SRM). Ions representing the<br>
positive ion mode (M+H)+ species for Icb, IVc and the internal standard were selected<br>
in MSI and collisionally dissociated with nitrogen and optimized collision energies to<br>
form specific product ions subsequently monitored by MS2. The SRM transitions for<br>
Icb, IVc and Compound X were m/z 584-^486, 474^256 and 460-&gt;218,<br>
respectively.<br>
Standard curves ranging from 5 nM to 10 uJVt were prepared from stock<br>
solutions and serially diluted in matrix for both Icb and IVc. Standard curves were<br>
aliquoted in duplicate, extracted with the samples, and injected at the beginning,<br>
middle, and end of the analytical sequence. The standard curves were fitted with a<br>
linear regression weighted by reciprocal concentration 1/x2. Data and<br>
chromatographic peaks were processed and concentrations of standards and<br>
unknowns were quantitatcd using PEBiosystems Analyst™ 1.1.<br>
In Vitro Methods<br>
(1) Stability of Icb in EDTA Blood, Serum and Tris-HCl Buffer<br>
The stability of Icb was studied in fresh blood and serum from rat, dog,<br>
monkey and human (n = 2). The blood was collected in vacutainers containing<br>
KaEDTA (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NT). The serum was collected in<br>
vacutainers containing no anticoagulant. Icb was incubated at a starting concentration<br>
of approximately 10 jLiM for 90 min at 37°C. Serial samples were taken at the predetermined<br>
times. Aliquots of blood samples (200 uJL) were first mixed with 100 jiL<br>
of water followed by 400 uL of acetonirrile. The serum samples (50 |iL) were added<br>
into microtainers containing K?EDTA (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ)<br>
followed by the addition of 100 jxL of acetonitrile. The supernatant was analyzed for<br>
both Icb and IVc by LC/MS/MS.<br>
The stability of Icb was also evaluated, as described above, in Tris-HCl buffer<br>
(0.1M,pH7.5).<br>
(2) Hydrolysis of Icb in the Presence of Human Placenta! ALP<br>
Solid human placental ALP was obtained from Sigma (P-3895, St. Louis,<br>
MO). A solution of 1000 units/L was prepared in Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.5).<br>
Solutions of 100 and 10 units/L were obtained by serial dilution. Icb was incubated<br>
in the 10, 100 and 1000 units/L solutions (n - 2) at 37°C for 2 hr. The starting<br>
concentration of Icb in the incubation was 10 pM. Aliquots of 100 [iL samples were<br>
taken at pre-determined times and added into K^EDTA microtainers followed by the<br>
addition of 200 nJL of acetonitrile. The supernatant was analyzed for both Icb and<br>
IVc by LC/MS/MS.<br>
(1) In Vivo Studies in the Rat<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (300-350 g, Hilltop Lab Animals, Inc., Scottsdale,<br>
PA) with cannulas implanted in the jugular vein were used. The rats were fasted<br>
overnight in the PO pharmacokinetic studies. Blood samples were collected from the<br>
jugular vein.<br>
In the IV study, Icb was delivered at 1.4 mg/kg (free acid, or 1.1 mg/kg of IVc<br>
equivalent) as a bolus over 0.5 min (n = 3). The concentration of the dosing solution<br>
was 1.4 mg/mL, and the dosing volume was 1 mL/kg. Serial blood samples were<br>
collected before dosing and at 2, 10, 15, 30, 45 min, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hr after<br>
dosing.<br>
In the PO study, Icb was administered at 6.9 mg/kg (free acid, or 5.6 mg/kg of<br>
IVc equivalent) by oral gavage (n = 3). The concentration of the dosing solution was<br>
1.4 mg/mL, and the dosing volume was 5 mL/kg. Serial blood samples were<br>
collected before dosing and at 15, 30, 45 min, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hr after dosing.<br>
 (2) In Vivo Studies in the Dog<br>
The IV and PO studies of Icb were conducted in a crossover fashion in three<br>
male beagle dogs (12 + 2.8 kg, Marshall Farms USA Inc., North Rose, NY). There<br>
was a two-week washout period between the IV and PO studies.<br>
Iti the IV study, Icb was infused via the cephalic vein at 1.3 rng/kg (free acid,<br>
or 1.0 mg/lcg of IVc equivalent) over 5 min at a constant rate of 0.1 mL/kg/min. The<br>
concentration of the dosing solution was 2.6 mg/mL, and the dosing volume was 0.5<br>
mL/kg. Serial blood samples were collected from the femoral artery before dosing<br>
and at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45 min, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hr after dosing.<br>
In the PO study, the dogs were fasted overnight before dosing. Icb was<br>
administered by oral gavage at 6.0 mg/kg (free acid, or 4.9 mg/kg of FVc equivalent).<br>
The concentration of the dosing solution was 12 mg/mL, and the dosing volume was<br>
0.5 mL/kg. Serial blood samples were collected before dosing and at 15, 30,45 min,<br>
1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hr after dosing.<br>
 (3) In Vivo Studies in the Monkey<br>
The W and PO studies of Icb were conducted in a crossover fashion in three<br>
male cynomolgus monkeys (10 + 1.6 kg, Charles River Biomedical Research<br>
Foundation, Houston, TX). There was a two-week washout period between the IV<br>
and PO studies.<br>
hi the IV study, Icb was infused via the femoral vein at 1.4 mg/kg (free acid,<br>
or 1.1 mg/kg of IVc equivalent) over 5 min at a constant rate of 0.1 mL/kg/min. The<br>
concentration of the dosing solution was 2.8 mg/mL, and the dosing volume was 0.5<br>
mL/kg. Serial blood samples were collected from the femoral artery before dosing<br>
and at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45 min, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hr after dosing.<br>
hi the PO study, the monkeys were fasted overnight before dosing. Icb was<br>
administered by oral gavage at 4.9 mg/kg (free acid, or 4.0 mg/kg of IVc equivalent).<br>
The concentration of the dosing solution was 9.8 mg/mL, and the dosing volume was<br>
0.5 mL/kg. Serial blood samples were collected before dosing and at 15, 30, 45 min,<br>
1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hr after dosing.<br>
 (4) Data Analysis<br>
All results are expressed as mean + SD, unless specified otherwise.<br>
The pharmacokinetic parameters of Icb and IVc were calculated by Non-<br>
Compartmental Analysis using the KINETICA™ software program (version 4.0.2,<br>
. InnaPhase Co., Philadelphia, PA). The Cmax and Tmax values were recorded<br>
directly from experimental observations. The AUCo-n and AUCtot values were<br>
calculated using the mixed log-linear trapezoidal summations. The total body<br>
clearance (Cl), mean residence time (MRT), and the steady state volume of<br>
distribution (Vss) were also calculated after intravenous administration. The absolute<br>
oral bioavailability (expressed as %) was estimated by taking the ratio of dosenormalized<br>
AUC values after oral doses to those after intravenous doses.<br>
The in vitro intrinsic clearance of Icb in hepatocytes (Cl;nt) was calculated as<br>
follows:<br>
Clint (|iL/min/million cells) = Rate / CE<br>
where Rate is the rate of metabolism in hepatocytes (pmol/min/million cells), and CE<br>
is the concentration of Icb in the incubation.<br>
The in vivo intrinsic hepatic clearance of Icb (Cl^in vivo) was calculated as follows:<br>
120 (million cells) % g liver 1<br>
munvnov t./ g hver kg body weight 1rv1A0A00<br>
where % is 40, 32, 30 and 26 g liver/leg body weight for the rat, dog, monkey and<br>
human, respectively (Davis and Morris, 1993).<br>
The hepatic clearance Cljj was calculated from the following equation using the wellstirred<br>
model:<br>
.<br>
C1H (mL/min/kg) = nj n<br>
where Qh is the liver blood flow of 55,31, 44 and 21 mL/min/kg for the rat, dog,<br>
monkey and human, respectively (Davis and Morris, 1993).<br>
The hepatic extraction ration (ER) was calculated at follows:<br>
ER = ClH/Qh<br>
/wStudent's t-test was used for statistical analysis (Microsoft Excel, Redmond, WA).<br>
Differences were considered statistically significant at the level of P 
In Vitro Studies<br>
Stability of Icb in EDTA Blood, Serum and Tris-HCl Buffer<br>
As part of the analytical assay validation, the stability of Icb was studied in<br>
blood containing EDTA, which is known to be an inhibitor of alkaline phosphatases<br>
(Bowers, Jr. and McComb, 1966; Yora and Sakagishi, 1986). After incubation at<br>
37°C for 90 min, there was less than 2% conversion of Icb to IVc in blood containing<br>
EDTA and in the presence of Tris-HCl buffer (Tables 39 and 40). Under the sample<br>
storage condition of -20°C, the above small percentages of conversion observed at<br>
37°C are not expected to introduce any significant ex vivo conversion during the<br>
analysis of Icb.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
To investigate the hydrolysis of Icb in the systemic circulation, Icb was<br>
incubated in fresh serum (rat, dog, monkey and human) at 37°C for 90 min. The rate<br>
of hydrolysis was, most rapid in the monkey serum, followed by rat, human and dog<br>
sera (Table 41). The conversion of Icb to IVc was near stoichiometric.<br>
Serum contains lower ALP activities as compared to tissues (McComb et al,<br>
1979a). In addition, serum also contains ALP isoforms from tissue sources such as<br>
bone, liver and intestine, as a result of enzyme leakage through the blood vessels<br>
(Moss, 1983). Therefore, the hydrolysis of Icb in serum was probably mediated by<br>
multiple isoforms of ALP.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
To study the hydrolysis oflcb in a purified form, of human ALP, Icb was<br>
incubated at 37°C (2 hr) with solutions containing human placental ALP (10, 100 and<br>
1000 units/L). The disappearance t]/2 oflcb was determined (Table 42). As<br>
expected, the rate of hydrolysis was faster in the solutions with, higher ALP activities.<br>
We was also formed accordingly (Fig. 20). This indicates that Icb is hydrolyzed by<br>
the ALP derived from humans to form IVc.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The pharmacokinetic parameters oflcb and IVc in rats after IV and oral<br>
administration oflcb are summarized in Table 43. The plasma concentration versus<br>
time profiles are shown in Figure 21. For comparison, the historical data from the<br>
pharmacokinetic studies of IVc in rats are also shown.<br>
The total body clearance (Cl) oflcb following IV administration was 49<br>
mL/min/kg, suggesting that Icb is a high clearance compound in rats. The<br>
elimination half-life (ti/2) and mean residence time (MRT) after TV administration<br>
were 0.084 hr and 0.072 In; respectively. The volume of distribution oflcb at steady<br>
state (Vss) was 0.21 L/lcg, suggesting very limited tissue distribution. The formation<br>
of We from Icb after IV administration was rapid; IVc was detected at the first<br>
sampling time point of 2 min (data not shown). The IV AUC ratio of IVc formed<br>
from Icb vs. from the historical. IVc study was 1.0 (theoretical value for complete<br>
conversion =1), suggesting complete conversion of Icb to IVc.<br>
Icb was not detected (LLQ = 5 nM) in any plasma samples after oral<br>
administration. The Tmax of We after oral administration of Icb was 0.80 lir, which<br>
is shorter than the historical Tmax of We of 4.0 hr, indicating more rapid absorption<br>
of IVc following the oral administration of the prodrag. The more rapid absorption of<br>
We from the prodrag is likely the result of better aqueous solubility of Icb as well as<br>
rapid hydrolysis of Icb to form We in the intestine. The absolute oral bioavailability<br>
of We from Icb was 80%, similar to the historical We value of 82% (Table 43).<br>
Moreover, the exposure of IVc from the Icb rat oral dose escalation study was<br>
superior as compared to the historical data with IVc (Table 37 and Fig. 18).<br>
The terminal plasma concentration vs. time profiles of IVc formed from Icb<br>
are similar to the historical IVc profiles (Fig, 21).<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The pharmacokinetic parameters of Icb and IVc in dogs after IV and oral<br>
administration of Icb are summarized in Table 44. The plasma concentration versus<br>
time profiles are shown in Figure 22. For comparison, the historical data from the<br>
pharmacokinetic studies of IVc in dogs are also shown.<br>
The Cl of Icb after IV administration was 64 mL/min/kg, significantly higher<br>
than the liver blood flow of 31 mL/min/kg in dogs, and suggests the involvement of<br>
extrahepatic hydrolysis and/or other route(s) of elimination (e.g., renal excretion).<br>
The ti/2 and MRT after IV administration were 0.25 hr and 0.14 hr, respectively. Icb<br>
was not detected beyond 2 hr. The Vss of Icb was 0.50 L/kg, suggesting low<br>
potential for tissue distribution. The formation of IVc from Icb after IV<br>
administration was rapid; IVc was detected at the first sampling time point of 5 min<br>
(data not shown). The IV AUC ratio of We formed from Icb vs. from the historical<br>
We study was 0.67, suggesting moderate conversion of Icb to IVc in dogs after IV<br>
administration.<br>
Icb was not detected (LLQ = 5 nM) in any plasma samples oral<br>
administration. The Tmax of IVc after oral administration of Icb was 0.58 hr, which<br>
is shorter than the historical Tmax of IVc of 1.3 hr, indicating more rapid absorption<br>
of IVc following the oral administration of the prodrug. The absolute oral<br>
bioavallability of IVc from Icb was 104%, similar to the Mstorical'IVc data of 89%.<br>
Moreover, the exposure of IVc from the Icb dog tolerability study (dose escalation)<br>
was better when compared to the historical data with IVc (Table 41 and Fig. 21).<br>
The terminal plasma concentration vs. time profiles of IVc formed from Icb<br>
are similar to the historical IVc profiles (Fig. 22).<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The pharmacokinetic parameters of Icb and IVc in monkeys following IV and<br>
oral administration of Icb are summarized in Table 45. The plasma concentration<br>
versus time profiles are shown in Figure 23. For comparison, the historical data from<br>
the pharmacokinetic studies of IVc in monkeys are also shown.<br>
The Cl of Icb after IV administration was 47 mL/min/kg, similar to the liver<br>
blood flow of 44 mL/min/kg in monkeys, suggesting that Icb is a high clearance<br>
compound in monkeys. The t\/2 and MRT after IV administration were O.OS9hr and<br>
0.097 hr, respectively. The Vss of Icb was 0.27 L/kg, suggesting limited tissue<br>
distribution. The formation of IVc from Icb after IV administration was rapid; IVc<br>
was detected at the first sampling time point of 5 min (data not shown). The IV AUC<br>
ratio of IVc formed from Icb vs. from the historical IVc study was 0.90, suggesting<br>
good conversion of Icb to IVc.<br>
Icb was not detected (LLQ = 5 nM) in any plasma samples after oral<br>
administration. The Tmax of IVc after oral administration of Icb was 0.92 hr, which<br>
is shorter than the historical Tmax of IVc of 2.3 hr, indicating more rapid absorption<br>
of IVc following the oral administration of the prodrag. The absolute oral<br>
bioavailability of IVc from Icb was 122%, which is higher that the historical IVc data<br>

Note on detection of prodrugs in plasma and other tissues. Once a salt form of a<br>
prodrug is administered, it is understood that in the body, scrambling of the salt may<br>
occur. However the assays used to quantitate for prodrugs in the subject animal<br>
models deletes by analysis the free acid ofthephophate. This analyzing for example<br>
a lysine salt lab or a free acid lac is assumed to be analyzing for the same species<br>
and is not intended to imply that the species detected was actually the lysine salt. In<br>
this application, this convention applies to samples obtained from in vivo studies and<br>
samples only<br>

• "DMSO" means dimethylsulfoxide<br>
The materials and experimental procedures used to assess the anti-HIV<br>
activity of the parent compounds which are generated from the prodrugs in vivo are<br>
described below:<br>
Cells:<br>
• The human T cell line MT-2 and PM1 (AIDS Research and Reference Reagent<br>
Program, National Institutes of Health) were maintained and propagated in<br>
Medium RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), containing 10% fetal Bovine<br>
serum. (FBS, Sigma, St. Louis , MO).<br>
Virus:<br>
• Laboratory strains ofHW-1 -the T-tropic strain LAI was obtained through the<br>
AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, National Institutes of Health. It<br>
was amplified in MT-2 cells and titered using a virus yield assay (2). Detection<br>
was achieved through use of a reverse transcriptase assay (3), adapted for use with<br>
a Scintillation Proximity detection protocol (1) (Amersham Biosciences,<br>
Piscataway, NJ).<br>
Experiment<br>
1. Compounds stocks were prepared by dissolving in DMSO to 30 mM. For<br>
polypropylene plates, so that the concentrations were 100-fold greater than the<br>
final assay concentration. For antiviral and cytotoxicity assays, 2 ul was added<br>
per well (1% final DMSO concentration).<br>
2. Compounds were added from dilution plates to 96 well tissue culture plates,<br>
containing 100 ul Medium RPMI-1640, containing 10 % fetal bovine serum at a<br>
concentration of 20 µM.<br>
3. For antiviral assays, cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 0.005.<br>
After 1 h at 37 °C, infected cells were diluted to 200,000 cells per ml in Medium<br>
RPMI-1640, containing 10% fetal bovine serum. 100 ul of this solution was<br>
added per well, giving a final volume of 200 pi.<br>
4. Plates were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified COa incubator and harvested after<br>
5 days.<br>
5. Viral infections were monitored by measuring reverse transcriptase activity in the<br>
supernatants of infected wells as described above. The percent inhibition for each<br>
compound was calculated by quantifying the readout level in cells infected in the<br>
presence of each compound as a percentage of that observed for cells infected in<br>
the absence of compound and subtracting such a determined value from 100.<br>
6. An ECso provides a method for comparing the antiviral potency of the compounds<br>
of this invention. The effective concentration for fifty percent inhibition (ECso)<br>
was calculated with the Microsoft Excel Xlfit curve fitting software. For each<br>
compound, curves were generated from percent inhibition calculated at 8 different<br>
concentrations by using a four paramenter logistic model (model 205). The<br>
data for the compounds is shown in Table 48.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The anti-HIV activity of the prodrugs themselves are not relevant since the<br>
parent molecules, as shown by the studies below, are generated from the prodrugs in<br>
vivo and are the active ingredient and also the major species in the plasma. In<br>
addition, the prodrugs may slowly convert to parents in the in vitro assays at least to a<br>
limited extent thus complicating interpretation of the antiviral data.<br>
Cytotoxicity<br>
1. Cytotoxicity assays were conducted with the same MT-2 cells, using methodology<br>
well known in the art. This method has been described in the literature (4). In<br>
brief, cells were incubated in the presence of drag for six days, after which cell<br>
viability was measured using a redox-active dye reduction assay. 50 ul of XTT<br>
reagent (1 mg/ml 2,3-bis[2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-<br>
carboxanilide, 10 ug/ml phenazine methosulfate dissolved in phosphate buffered<br>
saline) was added to each well and incubated for 3 hours. Color formation by<br>
actively respiring cells was quantitated in a plate reader at 450 nm, and used to<br>
determine a CC50. The CC50 for IVa,lVb, We, and IVd parent molecules were<br>
greater than 10 jiM when measured by this method. The Cytotoxicity data is a<br>
secondary screen which shows the compounds are not nonspecifically killing the<br>
cells which were used in the antiviral assay and provides further support for the<br>
contention that the compounds possess antiviral activity.<br>
Thus, in accordance with the present invention there is further provided a<br>
method of treating and a pharmaceutical composition for treating viral infections such<br>
as HIV infection and AIDS. The treatment involves administering to a patient in<br>
need of such treatment a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutical<br>
carrier and a therapeutically-effective amount of a compound of the present invention.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition may be in the form of orally-admrnistrable<br>
suspensions or tablets; nasal sprays, sterile injectable preparations, for example, as<br>
sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspensions or suppositories.<br>
When administered orally as a suspension, these compositions are prepared<br>
according to techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may<br>
contain microcrystalline cellulose for imparting bulk, alginic acid or sodium alginate<br>
as a suspending agent, methylcellulose as a viscosity enhancer, and<br>
sweetners/flavoring agents known in the art. As immediate release tablets, these<br>
compositions may contain microcrystalline cellulose, dicalcium phosphate, starch,<br>
magnesium stearate and lactose and/or other excipients, binders, extenders,<br>
disintegrants, diluents and lubricants known in the art.<br>
The injectable solutions or suspensions maybe formulated according to<br>
known art, using suitable non-toxic, parenterally-acceptable diluents or solvents, such<br>
as mannitol, 1,3-butanediol, water, Ringer's solution or isotonic sodium chloride<br>
solution, or suitable dispersing or wetting and suspending agents, such as sterile,<br>
bland, fixed oils, including synthetic mono- or diglycerides, and fatty acids, including<br>
oleic acid.<br>
The compounds of this invention can be administered orally to humans in a<br>
dosage range of 1 to 100 mg/kg body weight in divided doses. One preferred dosage<br>
range is 1 to 10 mg/kg body weight orally in divided doses. Other preferred dosage<br>
ranges are 1 to 20 mg/kg and 1 to 30 mg/kg body weight orally in divided doses. It<br>
will be understood, however, that the specific dose level and frequency of dosage for<br>
any particular patient may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors<br>
including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and<br>
length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet,<br>
mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of<br>
the particular condition, and the host undergoing therapy.<br><br><br><br>
