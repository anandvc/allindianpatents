FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention, relates to crystalline polymorphic forms of atorvastatin hemi-calcium, novel processes tor preparing crystalline forms of atorvastatin hemi-calcium and crystalline atorvastatin hemi-calcium with a small particle size distribution"<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Atorvastatin, ([R-(R*,R*)]-2-(4-fIuorophenyl)-ß,δ-dihydxoxy-5-(l-methylethyl)-3-phenyl-4-[(phenylammo)carbonyl]-lH-pyrrole-l-heptanoic acid), depicted in lactone form in formula (I) and its calcium salt trihydrate of formula (H) are well Icnown in the art, and described, inter alia, in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,681,893, 5,273,995, and in copending USSN 60/166,153, filed November 17,2000, all of which are herein incorporated by reference. .<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Atorvastatin is a member of the class of drugs called statins. Statin drugs are currently the most therapeutically effective drugs available for reducing low density lipoprotein (LDL) particle concentration in the blood stream of patients at risk for cardiovascular disease. A high level of LDL in the bloodstream has been linked to the formation of coronary lesions which obstruct the flow of blood and can rupture and<br>
promote thrombosis. Goodman and Oilman, The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics 879 (9th ed. 1996). Reducing plasma LDL levels has been shown to reduce the risk of clinical events in patients with cardiovascular disease and patients who are free of cardiovascular disease but who have hypercholesterolemia. Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study Group, 1994; Lipid Research Clinics Program, 1984a, 1984b.<br>
The mechanism of action of statin drugs has been elucidated in some detail. They interfere with the synthesis of cholesterol and other sterols in the liver by competitively inhibiting the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-gIutaryl-coenzyme A reductase enzyme ("HMG-CoA reductase"). HMG-CoA reductase catalyzes the conversion HMG to mevalonate, which is the rate determining step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol, and so, its inhibition leads to a reduction in the concentration of cholesterol in the liver. Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) is the biological vehicle for transporting cholesterol and triglycerides from the liver to peripheral cells. VLDL is catabolized in the peripheral cells which releases fatty acids which may be stored in adopcytes or oxidized by muscle. The VLDL is converted to intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), which is either removed by an LDL receptor, or is converted to LDL. Decreased production of cholesterol leads to an increase in the number of LDL receptors and corresponding reduction in the production of LDL particles by metabolism of IDL.<br>
Atorvastatin hemi-calcium salt trihydrate is marketed under the name LIPITOR by Warner-Lambert Co. Atorvastatin was first disclosed to the public and claimed in U.S. Patent No. 4,681,893. The hemi-calcium salt depicted in formula (II) is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,273,995. The '995 patent teaches that the hemi-calcium salt is obtained by crystallization from a brine solution resulting from the transposition of the sodium salt with CaCl2 and further purified by recrystallization from a 5:3 mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane.<br>
The present invention provides new crystal forms of atorvastatin hemi-calcium in both solvated and hydrated states. The occurrence of different crystal forms (polymorphism) is a property of some molecules and molecular complexes. A single molecule, like the atorvastatin in formula (I) or the salt complex of formula (H), may give rise to a variety of solids having distinct physical properties like melting point, X-ray<br>
diffraction pattern, infrared absorption fingerprint and NMR spectrum. The differences in the physical properties of polymorphs result from the orientation and intermolecular interactions of adjacent molecules (complexes) in the bulk solid. Accordingly, polymorphs are distinct solids sharing the same molecular formula yet having distinct advantageous and/or disadvantageous physical properties compared to other forms in the polymorph family. One of the most important physical properties of pharmaceutical polymorphs is their solubility hi aqueous solution, particularly their solubility in the gastric juices of a patient. For example, where absorption through the gastrointestinal tract is slow, it is often desirable for a drug that is unstable to conditions in the patient's stomach or intestine to dissolve slowly so that it does not accumulate in a deleterious environment. On the other hand, where the effectiveness of a drug correlates with peak bloodstream levels of the drug, a property shared by statin drugs, and provided the drug is rapidly absorbed by the GI system, then a more rapidly dissolving form is likely to exhibit increased effectiveness over a comparable amount of a more slowly dissolving form.<br>
Crystalline Forms I, n, III and IV of atorvastatin hemi-calcium are the subjects of U.S. Patents Nos. 5,959,156 and 6,121,461 assigned to Warner-Lambert and crystalline atorvastatin hemi-calcium Form V is disclosed in commonly-owned PCT Application No. PCT7USOO/31555.  There is an assertion in the '156 patent that Form I possesses more favorable filtration and drying characteristics than the known amorphous form of atorvastatin hemi-calcium.   Although Form I remedies some of the deficiencies of the amorphous material in terms of manufacturability, there remains a need for yet further improvement in these properties as well as improvements in other properties such as flowability, vapor impermeability and solubility. Rurther, the discovery of new crystalline polymorphic forms of a drug enlarges the repertoire of materials that a formulation scientist has with which to design a pharmaceutical dosage form of a drug with a targeted release profile or other desired characteristic.<br>

Some crystalline forms of atorvastatin hemi-calcium of the present invention exist in a solvated state and hydrated state. Hydrates have been analyzed by Karl-Fisher and thermogravimetric analysis.<br>
Powder X-ray diffraction ("PXRD") analysis employing conventional CuK,, radiation was performed by methods known in the art using a SCINTAG powder X-ray diffractometer model X'TRA equipped with a solid-state detector. Copper radiation of X<br>
= 1.5418 A was used. Measurement range: 2-40 degrees 20. The sample was introduced . using a round standard aluminum sample holder with round zero background quartz plate in the bottom. Powdered samples were gently ground and filled in the round cavity of the sample holder by pressing with a glass plate.<br>
PXRD analysis using a synchrotron X-ray source was performed at the National Synchrotron Light Source of the Brookhaven National Laboratory (diffractometer station X3B1). Samples were loosely packed into thin-walled glass capillaries. X-ray radiation was approximately 1.15 A. Since the wavelength of incident light does correspond to the wavelength most commonly used hi conventional PXRD analysis, X-ray peak positions in the diffraction patterns obtained from the synchrotron source are expressed in terms of d spacings, which are invariant with changes in wavelength of the X-radiation used to produce the pattern. The scan width was from 1 to 20 degrees 20. The resolution of the spectra is in the range of 0.01 to 0.03 degrees full width at half maximum. The positions of well resolved peaks are accurate to within 0.003 to 0.01 degrees.<br>
The CP/MAS 13C NMR measurements were made at 125.76 MHz and were performed on a Bruker DMX-500 digital FT NMR spectrometer equipped with a BL-4 CP/MAS probehead and a High Resolution / High Performance 'H preamplifier for solids: spin rate 5.0kHz, pulse sequence SELTICS, sample holder: Zirconia rotor 4mm diameter. Atorvastatin hemi-calcium Form VI is characterized by a powder X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 1) with peaks at 3.5, 5.1, 7.7, 8.2, 8.7, 10.0, 12.5, 13.8, 16.2, 17.2, 17.9 18.3, 19.5, 20.4, 20.9, 21.7, 22.4, 23.2, 24.3, 25.5 ± 0.2 degrees two-theta. The most characteristic peak is observed at 19.5±0.2 degrees two-theta. The PXRD pattern of Form VI was taken using a Phylips diffractometer similar to the SCINTAG instrumentation described above.<br>
Atorvastatin hemi-calcium Form VI may be obtained by dissolving any other form of atorvastatin hemi-calcium, preferably Form I, in acetone and then precipitating Form VI by addition of an anti-solvent, preferably water.<br>
Atorvastatin hemi-calcium Form VT1 is characterized by a powder X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 2) having two broad peaks, one in the range 18.5-21.8 and the<br>
other in the range of 21.8-25.0 degrees 20, and other additional broad peaks at 4.7, 7.8, 93, 12.0, 17.1, 18.2±0.2 degrees 26. Samples of Form VII may contain up to 12% water. Form VII is readily distinguished from known forms of atorvastatin hemi-calcium by the broad peaks at 7.8 and 9.3±0.2 degrees 29. For instance, Form I has peaks at 9.2, 9.5,10.3,10.6,11.0 and 12.2 degrees 29 according to the information provided in U.S. Patent No. 5,969,156. In this region, Form n has two sharp peaks at 8.5 and 9.0 degrees 20 and Form IV has one strong peak at 8.0 degrees 29. The other broad peaks in the region of 15-25 degrees 29 distinguish Form VII from all other forms. Forms I, III and TV all have sharp peaks in this region.<br>
Atorvastatin hemi-calcium Form VII may be prepared by treating atorvastatin calcium Forms I or V with ethanol, preferably absolute ethanol, at room temperature to reflux temperature for a period of from about 1 h to about 24 h, preferably 2.5-16 h. If the process is carried out in refluxing EtOH, the conversion is complete in about 2.5 h. If the process is carried out at room temperature a longer period is required.<br>
Atorvastatin hemi-calcium Form VDI is characterized by a powder X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 3) obtained using conventional CuK,, radiation having peaks at 4.8, 5:2, 5.9, 7.0, 8.0, 9.3, 9.6, 10.4, 11.9,16.3, 17.1(broad), 17.9,18.6,19.2, 20.0, 20.8, 21.1, 21.6, 22.4,22.8, 23.9, 24.7, 25.6, 26.5, 29.0± 0.2 degrees two-theta. The most characteristic peaks are at 6.9, 9.3, 9.6, 16.3, 37.1, 19.2,20.0,21.6,22.4,23,9,24.7,25.6, and 26.5±0.2 degrees 29. Samples of atorvastatin hemi-calcium Form VIII were found to contain up to 7% water by Karl Fisher.         Form VIII is readily distinguished from Forms I-IV by its characteristic sharp peaks at 9.3 and 9.6 degrees 29. According to the information provided in U.S. Patent No. 5,969,156, Form I has one medium peak at 6.9 and sharp peaks at 9.2, 9.5, 10.3,10.6,11.0 and 12.2±0.2 degrees 29. Form IV is said to have two peaks at 8.0 and 9.7 degrees 26. Form n is said to have in this region two sharp peaks at 8.5 and 9.0 degrees 26. Form III has in this region one strong sharp peak at 8.7 degrees 26 according to the information provided in U .S. Patent No. 6,121,461. The features are not observed in the Form VIIIPXRD pattern.   Further, there is in the PXKD pattern of Form VIII one sharp, medium intensity peak at 7.0 which is well distinguished<br>
from other peaks in the region. A comparison of the PXKD pattern of Form VIII with the patterns of Forms I-IV reveals that this feature of the Form VIII pattern is distinctive.<br>
Other peaks in the Form VIII pattern that are unique to this form are the two strong and sharp peaks at 19.2 and 20.0 degrees 20. In this region, Form I has sharp peaks at 21.6,22.7, 23.3 and 23.7 degrees 29 according to the information provided in the ' 156 patent. Form IV is said to have peaks at 18.4 and 19.6 degrees 20, while Form n has two main peaks at 17.0 and 20.5 and Form m has peaks at 17.7,18.2,18.9, 20.0 and20.3±0.2 degrees 26.<br>
Synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction analysis was performed on Form VIII to determine its crystal system and unit cell dimensions. Form VIII has a monoclinic unit cell with lattice dimensions: a = 18.55-18.7 A, b = 5.52-5.53 A, c = 31.0-31.2 A and angle P between the a and c axes of 97.5-99.5 °. The unit cell parameters were determined using the Le Bail method.<br>
The diffractogram of Fig. 4 obtained using a synchrotron X-ray source has many sharp well resolved peaks. The d-spacings of some of the more prominent peaks are listed in Table 1, along with the positions in units of two-theta that the peaks would have using CuK,, radiation of 1.5418A.<br>

• Calculated from d for CuK, radiation<br>
Because of the natural variation between independent samples and measurements, the peak positions may deviate from the reported positions by as much as 0.5% of the d values. There may be larger shifts if the material undergoes size reduction as micronization.<br>
Atorvastatin hemi-calcium Form VIII produced the solid-state 13C NMR spectrum shown in Fig. 5. Form VIII is characterized by the following solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shifts in ppm: 17.8, 20.0, 24.8, 25.2, 26.1, 40.3, 40.8, 41.5,<br>
43.4,	44.1, 46.1, 70.8, 73.3, 114.1, 116.0, 119.5, 120.1, 121.8, 122.8, 126.6, 128.8, 129.2,<br>
134.2 ,135.1, 137.0,138.3, 139.8,159.8, 166.4, 178.8, 186.5. Form VIII is characterized<br>
by a solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance having the following chemical shifts<br>
differences between the lowest ppm resonance and other resonances: 2.2, 7.0, 7.4, 8.3,<br>
22.4,	23.0, 23.7,25.6,26.3, 28.3, 53.0, 55.5, 96.3, 98.2, 101.7,102.3, 104.0,105.0,<br>
108.8,111.0, 111.4, 116.4, 117.3,119.2, 120.5, 122.0, 142.0, 148.6, 161.0 and 168.7.<br>
The chemical shifts reported for Form "VTtl are averaged from spectra taken of four<br>
samples of Form VOL Characteristic parts of the pattern are found at 24-26 ppm<br>
(aliphatic range), 119-140 ppm (aromatic range) and other regions. The shift values are<br>
accurate to within ±0.1 ppm, except for the carbonyl peak at 178.8 ppm which has a<br>
fluctuation of ±0.4 ppm.<br>
Atorvastatin hemi-calcium Form VIII can exist as an ethanol solvate containing up to about 3 % ethanol by weight.<br>
The following methods have been found suitable for generating Form VIII. This form may, however, also be accessible by empirical development and by routine modification of these procedures.<br>
Atorvastatin hemi-calcium Form VIII may be obtained by slurrying atorvastatin hemi-calcium in a mixture of ethanol and water at elevated temperature, preferably about 78-80°C. The slurrying procedure may be incorporated into the last step of a process for preparing atorvastatin hemi-calcium, which typically is generation of the hemi-calcium salt from the atorvastatin free acid or lactone by treatment with a source of calcium ion. In such a combined procedure the salt is generated in a solvent system comprising ethanol and water. Conveniently, after precipitation of the atorvastatin hemi-calcium salt by an<br>
additional amount of water, the salt may be slurried in the reaction mixture for a period of several hours, preferably from about 6 to about 16 hours to obtain atorvastatin hemi-calcium Form VIII.<br>
Form VIII also may be obtained starting from Form V by treating Form V with a mixture of EtOH:H2O, preferably in the ratio of about 5:1 at an elevated temperature below reflux, preferably 78-80°C. An especially preferred EtOH:H2O mixture contains about 4 % by volume water in ethanol.   During the heating, atorvastatin Form V gradually dissolves and at the point of 78-80°C turbidity, with or without seeding, is observed. At this point the suspension is immediately cooled to room temperature. Form VIII may be obtained by treating atorvastatin hemi-calcium in EtOH, preferably absolute EtOH, at elevated temperature, preferably boiling EtOH. Under these conditions, the atorvastatin dissolves and reprecipitates. MeOH may be added at reflux. Added MeOH may adversely affect the yield, but may improve the chemical purity of the product. Starting materials for preparing Form VIII by this process can be crystalline forms of atorvastatin hemi-calcium, preferably Forms I and V and mixtures thereof or amorphous atorvastatin hemi-calcium.<br>
The quantity of EtOH or mixture thereof with water is preferably in the range of from about 10 to about 100 ml g'1, more preferably about 20 to about 80 ml g'1.<br>
We have discovered that atorvastatin hemi-calcium that contains greater than 0.1% des-fluoro atorvastatin hemi-calcium and/or greater than 1 % trans atorvastatin hemi-calcium may be purified by suspending in a solution of about 96% ethanol and about 4% water at elevated temperature, preferably at reflux temperature. Typically, atorvastatin hemi-calcium is recovered with less than 0.07% contamination with des-fluoro atorvastatin hemi-calcium and less than 0.6% contamination with trans atorvastatin hemi-calcium.<br>
Form VIII also may be prepared by suspending atorvastatin hemi-calcium in certain 1-butanol/water and ethanol/water mixtures for a period of time sufficient to cause the conversion of the atorvastatin hemi-calcium to Form VIII. 1-Butanol/water mixtures should contain about 20% 1-butanol by volume at elevated temperature, preferably at reflux temperature.<br>
Atorvastatin hemi-calcium Form DC is characterized by a powder X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 5) with peaks at 4.7, 5.2, 5.7, 7.0, 7.9, 9.4, 10.2, 12.0, 17.0, 17.4, 18.2, 19.1, 19.9, 21.4, 22.5, 23.5, 24.8 (broad), 26.1, 28.7, 30.0±0.2 degrees two-theta. The most characteristic peaks of Form DC are at 6.9, 17.0, 17.4, 18.2, 18.6, 19.1, 19.9,21.4,22.5 and 23.5±0.2 degrees two-theta. Form DC may contain up to 7% water. Form DC also can exist as a butanol solvate containing up to about 5 % butanol.<br>
Form DC is readily distinguished by its characteristic sharp peaks at 18.6, 19.1, 19.9, 21.4, 22.5, 23.5 degrees 29. For comparison, Form I has sharp peaks at 21.6, 22.7, 23.3 and 23.7 degrees 29, while Form IV has in this region sharp peaks at 18.4 and 19.6 degrees 29 and Form n has two main peaks at 17.0 and 20.5 degrees 29, according to information in the '156 patent. Form in has in this region peaks at 17.7,18.3,18.9, 20.0 and 20.3 degrees 29. Also, there is in the PXRD pattern of Form DC, as there is in the pattern of Form VIII, a sharp, well distinguished medium intensity peak at 7.0 degrees 29.<br>
The crystal system and unit cell dimension of Form DC were determined using synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction analysis. Form DC has a monoclinic crystal lattice with lattice dimensions: a = 18.75-18.85 A, b = 5.525-5.54 A, c= 30.9-31.15 A and angle p between the aandcaxes of 96.5-97.5°.<br>
The d-spacings of some of the more prominent peaks in the synchrotron X-ray powder difrractogram of Fig. 7 are listed in Table 2, along with the positions in units of two-theta that the peaks would have using CuKn radiation.<br>

Atorvastatin hemi-calcium Form DC produced the solid-state I3C NMR spectrum shown in Fig. 8. Form DC is characterized by the following solid-state 13C nuclear resonance chemical shifts in ppm: 18.0, 20.4, 24.9, 26.1, 40.4, 46.4, 71.0, 73.4, 114.3, 116.0,119.5,120.2,121.7,122.8,126.7,128.6,129.4,134.3,135.1,136.8,138.3,139.4, 159.9,166.3,178.4, 186.6. Form DC is characterized by a solid-state 13C nuclear resonance having the following chemical shifts differences between the lowest ppm<br>
resonance and other resonances: 2.4, 6.9, 8.1, 22.4, 28.4, 53.0, 55.4, 96.3, 98.0, 101.5, 102.2, 103.7,104.8, 108.7, 110.6, 111.4, 116.3, 117.1, 118.8,120.3, 121.4, 141.9, 148.3, 160.4, 168.6.   Characteristic parts of the pattern are found at 24-26 ppm (aliphatic range), 119-140 ppm (aromatic range) and other regions. The chemical shifts of Form IX are an average taken from spectra on two samples of Form IX. The shift values are accurate to within ±0.1 ppm.<br>
Form IX may be prepared by the following processes though this form may be accessed by empirical development and by routine modification of these procedures.<br>
Atorvastatin hemi-calcium Form IX may be prepared by slurrying atorvastatin hemi-calcium in butanol and isolating Form DC by, for example, filtration or decantation of the butanol, preferably by filtration. Preferred temperature ranges for the slurrying are from 78 °C to the reflux temperature of the solvent. Recovery of atorvastatin hemi-calcium salt from the slurry can be enhanced by addition of an anti-solvent to the slurry before isolating Form DC. Preferred anti-solvents include isopropanol and H-hexane. Starting materials for preparing Form DC by this process can be crystalline or amorphous atorvastatin hemi-calcium, preferably Forms I and V and mixtures thereof.<br>
Form DC may be prepared by suspending Form VIII in ethanol, preferably absolute ethanol, at room temperature for a period of time sufficient to convert form VIII to Form IX, which may range from a few hours to 24 hours and typically requires about 16 hours. Thereafter Form DC is recovered from the suspeasion. Form DC also may be prepared by maintaining Form VIII under a humid atmosphere.<br>
Form DC also may be prepared by suspending atorvastatin hemi-calcium Form V in mixtures of 1-butanol and either ethanol or water at reflux temperature for a period of tune sufficient to convert Form V into Form IX and recovering Form DC from the suspension. Preferably the mixtures contain about 50 volume percent of each component. Atorvastatin hemi-calcium Form X is characterized by a powder X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 7) having peaks at 4.8, 5.3, 5.9, 9.6, 10.3, 11.5, 12.0, a double peak at 16.1 and 16.3,16.9, 17.4, 18.2, 19.2, 19.4, 20.0, 20.8, 21.6, 22.0, 22.8, 23.6, 24.6, 25.0, 25.5, 26.2, 26.8, 27.4, 28.0,30.3±0.2 degrees 26. The most characteristic peaks are two peaks<br>
at 20.0 and 20.8±0.2 degrees 26 and other peaks at 19.1,19.4,22.8, 23.6,25.0,28.0, 30.3±0.2 degrees 29. Form X contains up to 2% ethanol and may contain up to 4% water.<br>
Form X is distinguished from that of Form IV by having characteristic peaks at 7.0, 19.9, 20.7, 24.1, 25.0, 28.0 and 30.3±0.2 degrees 26. These features are clearly distinguished from those appearing the corresponding regions of the PXRD patterns of Forms I-FV which have been previously described.<br>
The crystal system and unit cell dimension of Form X were determined using synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction analysis. Form X has a monoclinic crystal lattice with lattice dimensions: a = 18.55-18.65 A, b = 5.52-5.53 A, c= 30.7-30.85 A and angle p between the a and c axes of 95.7-96.7°.<br>

following chemical shifts differences between the, lowest pptn resonance and other<br>
resonances: 1.0, 1.9, 2.9, 7.2, 25.7, 45.4, 48.5, 49.8, 53.4, 98.2, 101.8, 104.7, 109.0,<br>
111.2,	116.8, 120.3, 141.7, 148.5, 161.6, 163.4, 166.6, 168.4. Characteristic parts of the<br>
pattern are found at 24-26 ppm (aliphatic range), 119-140 ppm (aromatic range) and other<br>
regions. The chemical shifts of Form X are averaged from three spectra taken of three<br>
samples of Form X. The values reported are within ±0.1 ppm, except for the cafbonyl<br>
peak at 179. 3 ppm that is accurate within ±0.4 ppm.<br>
Atorvastatin hemi-calcium Form X may be prepared by treating crystalline atorvastatin hemi-calcium, preferably Form V or Form I or mixtures thereof, or amorphous atorvastatin hemi-calcium with a mixture of ethanol and water, preferably in a ratio of about 5:1, at elevated temperature, preferably at reflux temperature, for a period of from about half an hour to a few hours, preferably about 1 h. The starting material may be added to the EtOH:water mixture at room temperature, followed by gradual heating of the suspension to reflux. Alternatively, the starling form of atorvastatin hemi-calcium may be added to the refluxing solvent mixture. In either case, the atorvastatin hemi-calcium should be observed to dissolve hi the mixture and then reprecipitate in Form X. The ratio of atorvastatin hemi-calcium to the EtOH:water mixture preferably ranges from about 1:16 to about 1:25 (g:ml), more preferably from about 1:16 to about 1:21 (g:ml) and most preferably about 1:16 (g:ml). Form X may be collected by filtration shortly after cooling to room temperature or the suspension may be stirred for an addition period of<br>
from about 1 to about 20 hours, more preferably from about 3 to about 16 hours, before<br>
collecting the Form X.<br>
Atorvastatin hemi-calcium Form XI is characterized by a powder X-ray diffraction<br>
pattern (Fig. 9) having peaks at 3.2, 3.7, 5.1, 6.3, 7.8, 8.6, 9.8, 11.2, 11.8, 12.4,15.4,<br>
18.7, 19.9, 20.5,24.0 ±0.2 degrees two-theta.<br>
Form XI may be obtained by suspending atorvastatin hemi-calcium Form V in<br>
methyl ethyl ketone ("MEK") at room temperature for a period of time sufficient to cause<br>
the conversion of Form V into Form XI.<br><br>
Form XI also may be obtained by preparing a gel containing atorvastatin hemi-calcium in isopropyl alcohol and then drying the gel. The gel is best prepared by saturating isopropyl alcohol with atorvastatin hemi-calcium at reflux temperature and then cooling to room temperature. Extensive stirring at room temperature, as long as or more man 20 h, may be required in order for the gel to form. In the gel state, the solution is detectably more resistant to stirring and does not pour smoothly. The gel remains flowable in the sense that it can be stirred if sufficient force is applied and would not tear under such force.<br>
Atorvastatin hemi-calcium Form XII is characterized by a powder X-ray diffraction pattern having peaks at 2.7, 8.0, 8.4, 11.8,18.2,19.0,19.8,20.7 ±0,2 degrees two-theta, and a halo that indicates the presence of amorphous material. Typical X-ray powder diffraction patterns of atorvastatin hemi-calcium Form XII are shown in Fig. 10. Form XII may be prepared directly from the following compound<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
whose systematic chemical name is [R-(R*,R*)]-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-p, 5-dioxane-5-(l-memylemyl)-3-phenyl-4-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-lH-pyrrole-l-tert-butylheptanoic ester, and which will hereafter be referred to as pyrrole acetonide ester or PAE. Form XH is prepared by first subjecting PAE to conditions that cleave the acetonide and terf-butyl ester group. Prefered conditions employ aqueous hydrochloric acid, more preferably about 1.5% aqueous hydrochloric acid. The solution of atorvastatin, in either free acid or lactone form, or mixture thereof, is then treated with calcium hydroxide, preferably a modest excess thereof, more preferably about 1.5 equivalents with respect to the PAE. After association of the atorvastatin with dissolved calcium derived from the added hydroxide salt, any excess calcium hydroxide may be separated by filtration. One important feature of this process is the subsequent manipulation of the filtrate. Water is slowly added to the reaction mixture at mildly elevated temperature., preferably about<br>
65 °C, until atorvastatin hemi-calcium precipitates. At that point the temperature is increased until a clear solution is once again attained. The mixture is then allowed to cool resulting in the precipitation of atorvastatin hemi-calcium.   The isolated precipitate is atorvastatin hemi-calcium Form XII.<br>
The present invention also provides novel processes for preparing known forms of atorvastatin hemi-calcium.<br>
Form I may be obtained by treating any form of atorvastatin hemi-calcium with water at room temperature to 100°C for a period between a few to about 25 hours, preferably about 16 hours. Preferred starting materials are Forms V, VII, VIII, IX and X of atorvastatin hemi-calcium.<br>
Form I also may be prepared by sonicating a suspension of atorvastatin hemi-calcium in ethanol, preferably absolute ethanol or in water, at between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvent for a period of a few minutes. Preferably between 1 and 3 minutes. Atorvastatin hemi-calcium Form VII is a preferred starting material though other forms may be used as well.<br>
Form II may be prepared directly from [R.-(R*,R*)]-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-p, S-dioxane-5-(l-memylemyl)-3-phenyl-4-[(phenylaniino)carbonyl]-lH-pyrrole-l-tert-butylheptanoic ester (PAE) according to Example 31.<br>
Atorvastatin hemi-calcium Form IV may be prepared by suspending Form I or Form V in 1-butanol for a period of time sufficient to complete the conversion of Form I or Form V to Form IV and then isolating Form IV from the mixture. The conversion may require a prolonged period depending on temperature and other conditions. The conversion typically takes about 24-72 hours at room temperature. Form IV also may be obtained by suspending Form V hi EtOH/H2O at 50°C for a period of time sufficient to cause the conversion of Form V to Form IV and then recovering Form IV from the suspensions. Prefered EtOH/H2O mixtures contain about 15% H2O.<br>
Form IV also may be obtained by suspending atorvastatin hemi-calcium Form V in methanol for a period of time sufficient to cause the conversion of Form V to Form IV. The rate of conversion is sensitive to temperature and may take from about<br>
1 to about 25 hours under typical laboratory conditions. The conversion requires about 16 hours, at room temperature. The conversion may be conducted at elevated temperature up to the reflux temperature of the solvent.<br>
Form V may be prepared from PAE according to the process described with reference to the preparation of atorvastatin hemi-calcium Form XII. Form V may be obtained by drying Form XII at about 65 °C for about 24 hours. The atorvastatin hemi-calcium Form V obtained hi this manner is of high purity. However, it may be further purified by suspending in a mixture of about 10% water and about 90% ethanol and re<br>
Amorphous atorvastatin hemi-calcium may be prepared by treating any other form of atorvastatin hemi-calcium with acetone at room temperature to reflux temperature for between a few hours and 25 hours, preferably about 16 hours. A preferred starting material is Form V.<br>
Amorphous atorvastatin hemi-calcium also may be prepared by sonicating any form of atorvastatin hemi-calcium in acetonitrile at any temperature between room temperature and the reflux temperature of acetonitrile. Sonicating for a few minutes, preferably from 1 to 3 minutes, is sufficient to transform the starting material into amorphous atorvastatin hemi-calcium. Preferred starting forms of atorvastatin hemi-calcium are Forms VII and I.<br>
Amorphous atorvastatin hemi-calcium also may be prepared by ball milling of any crystalline form of atorvastatin hemi-calcium.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention is a pharmaceutical composition and dosage form containing the novel forms of atorvastatin hemi-calcium.<br>
The compositions of the invention include powders, granulates, aggregates and other solid compositions comprising novel Forms VI, VII, VIII, DC, X, XI and XII of atorvastatin hemi-calcium. In addition, Forms VI, VII, VIII, DC, X, XI and XTI solid compositions that are contemplated by the present invention may further include diluents, such as cellulose-derived materials like powdered cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, microfine cellulose, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl<br>
cellulose salts and other substituted and unsubstituted celluloses; starch; pregelatinized starch; inorganic diluents like calcium carbonate and calcium diphosphate and other diluents known to the pharmaceutical industry. Yet other suitable diluents include waxes, sugars and sugar alcohols like mannitol and sorbitol, acrylate polymers and copolymers, as well as pectin, dextrin and gelatin.<br>
Further excipients that are within the contemplation of the present invention include binders, such as acacia gum, pregelatinized starch, sodium alginate, glucose and other binders used in wet and dry granulation and direct compression tableting processes. Excipients that also may be present in a solid composition of Forms VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI and XII atorvastatin hemi-calcium further include disintegrants like sodium starch glycolate, crospovidone, low-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose and others. In addition, excipients may include tableting lubricants like magnesium and calcium stearate and sodium stearyl fumarate; flavorings; sweeteners; preservatives; pharmaceutically acceptable dyes and glidants such as silicon dioxide.<br>
The dosages include dosages suitable for oral, buccal, rectal, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous), inhalant and ophthalmic administration. Although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the condition being treated, the most preferred route of the present invention is oral. The Dosages may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well-known in the art of pharmacy.<br>
Dosage forms include solid dosage forms, like tablets, powders, capsules, suppositories, sachets, troches and losenges as well as liquid suspensions and elixirs. While the description is not intended to be limiting, the invention is also not intended to pertain to true solutions of atorvastatin hemi-calcium whereupon the properties that distinguish the solid forms of atorvastatin hemi-calcium are lost. However, the use of the novel forms to prepare such solutions (e.g. so as to deliver, in addition to atorvastatin, a solvate to said solution hi a certain ratio with a solvate) is considered to be within the contemplation of the invention.<br>
Capsule dosages, of course, will contain the solid composition within a capsule which may be made of gelatin or other conventional encapsulating material. Tablets<br>
and powders may be coated. Tablets and powders may be coated with an enteric coating. The enteric coated powder forms may have coatings comprising phthalic acid cellulose acetate, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose phthalate, polyvinyl alcohol phthalate, carboxymethylethylcellulose, a copolymer of styrene and maleic acid, a copolymer of methacrylic acid and methyl methacrylate, and like materials, and if desired, they may be employed with suitable plasticizers and/or extending agents.   A coated tablet may have a coating on the surface of the tablet or may be a tablet comprising a powder or granules with an enteric-coating.<br>
Preferred unit dosages of the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention typically contain from 0.5 to 100 mg of the novel atorvastatin hemi-calcium Forms<br>
VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI and XII or mixtures thereof with each other or other forms of<br>
atorvastatin hemi-calcium. More usually, the combined weight of the atorvastatin<br>
hemi-calcium forms of a unit dosage are from 2.5 mg. to 80 mg.<br>
