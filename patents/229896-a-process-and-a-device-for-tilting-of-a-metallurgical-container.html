The present invention relates to a process and a device for tilting of a metallurgical container movably mounted in a hanger with journals/pegs, especially pouring ladles.<br>
Such devices for tilting of metallurgical containers movably mounted in a hanger/ bail with journals/pegs, especially ladles, are referred to as tilting stool or ladle tilting stool and are known in the state-of-the-art of technology in several design forms.<br>
Such tilting stools find application especially in steelworks dealing with steel melting or steel manufacture. DE2610984 discloses an apparatus for liquid smoke regeneration. US4141540 discloses a hot metal ladle tilter. JP54146222 discloses a device for inclining and converting ladle and DE2146221 discloses a continuous casting plant ladle cradles - with cylinder operated tilting mechanisms.<br>
In the manufacture of steel, metallurgical containers especially pouring ladles are used for transport of liquid steel. The pouring ladles are containers lined with fire-proof material, which in their upper part has two hanging journals, on which one hanger each is movably mounted.<br>
The hangers can also be hooks or similar load carrying devices of a crane or such other lifting device or equipment which grip to the journals of the metallurgical containers in a movable fashion. Generally, the pouring ladles are transported with the use of a crane or such other lifting device. During transport of a ladle with the use of a crane, crane hooks jointed with the lifting drive of the crane through a traverse grip both the hangers. The hanger journals of the ladle are arranged in an upper area of the ladle in such a manner that through the position of the journals on the ladle the critical point of the ladle is always below the journals or the axis of the journals, so that the ladle hanging in the hangers in a crane hangs always vertically, that means in a vertical position.<br>
2<br><br>
In the bottom of the ladle customarily arresting/blocking organs for the liquid steel, the so called ladle sliders as well as the so called flushing stones/bricks, which serve the feeding of inert gas for homogenizing the steel-melt, are incorporated. The ladle sliders serve to empty the melt-in ingot moulds or casting machines. The ladle sliders have generally different ceramic, especially fire-proof ceramic consumables. After each emptying of the ladle, the ceramic consumables of the sliders must be cleaned, controlled or replaced. After certain intervals, maintenance and/or repair works which consume long periods of time must be carried out such as, for instance, a replacement and/or change of the ladle slider or a change or replacement of the flushing stones.<br>
The already personnel-intensive and material intensive work on the bottom of the ladles, it is also necessary that extensive advance work for carrying out the work on the ladle floor is necessary especially maintenance and/or repair work on the ladle sliders and flushing stones of the tadle. Therefore the ladles in steel works have to be transported generally over large distances to the neighbouring halls, which are far removed from the real steel making operations and have to be tilted there from a vertical position into a horizontal position for carrying out the work on the base/bottom of the ladle. For the preparatory work for carrying out the work on the ladle to that extent similarly a higher number of personnel and materials would be required especially for cranes, floor transport vehicles and such other requirements. These tasks are so time-intensive that the temperature (stone/brick temperature) of the ladle sinks to such an extent that the ladle after the maintenance and repair work must be again heated in order to be capable of being used again according to regulations. With this backdrop therefore in a metallurgical plant, especially in a steel plant in order to be able to handle the logistics ever more number of ladles heated to operating temperatures as per norms must be held in stock in such metallurgical units, especially in steel works than would otherwise be needed.<br>
2&gt;<br><br>
It is known that ladles are turned over from a vertical position into a horizontal position for purpose of carrying out work on the bottom of the ladles with the help of a crane with two lifting devices or strokes. In this context, a ladle hanging in vertical positions from a crane on its bail is turned by 90Â° in the air around the axis of its bail pegs with the use of a second crane stroke attached to the bottom area of the ladle, and thus is brought in a horizontal position. The ladle in horizontal position is then placed in a rack/stand. What is disadvantageous and dangerous in this context is especially the handling in the air of the ladle weighing about 120 ton and more.<br>
Further it is known to tilt ladles from a vertical position in a horizontal position with the use of the tilting devices earlier mentioned namely the so called tilting stools. In so doing, the ladle hanging in vertical position in a crane on its bails is placed in vertical position in the seating pockets of the tilting device and then independent of the crane is turned and/or tilted with the use of hydraulic and/or electro-mechanical drive in the horizontal position. The drive and the ladle holding devices of the hitherto known tilting devices take a lot of space which are technically expensive and overall cost-intensive.<br>
In the context of the state-of-the-art of technology, the invention is focused on presenting a process and a device for tilting of metallurgical containers movably mounted with journals/pegs in a bail, especially ladles, which, while avoiding the disadvantages described makes it possible to obtain a safe and quick tilting of the ladles in a cost-effective and simple manner, and especially make the use of drives or second crane strokes unnecessary.<br>
This task is solved in accordance with the invention thereby that a metallurgical container is tilted from a vertical position to a horizontal position through the gravitation force acting on it around the axis of its journals.<br>
M-<br><br>
This invention is based on the knowledge that a metallurgical container can be pivoted and tilted from a vertical position in a horizontal position without any drive in a simple manner, safely and securely, with the help of the gravitation force acting on the metallurgical container around the axis of its journals.<br>
The invention enables the carrying out of repair and/or maintenance work on the ladles together with the necessary subsidiary aggregates where applicable for a casting process as part of steel production in a steel plant in the short period of time.<br>
The subsidiary aggregates which are applied for this work at the bottom and the inner parts of the ladles, such as for instance, assembly and disassembly devices for perforated bricks on the spout of the ladles, flushing stones, ladle slider and ladle slider ceramics, laser measuring instruments with or without spray robots and cleaning devices for the fire proof walling of the ladles, can be utilized at the quickest possible time according to the invention. Further, a horizontally burning ladle fire can be applied at the quickest possible time as per the invention.<br>
Advantageously, the metallurgical containers hang at least during the tilting operation with its bails on a load carrying device of a crane. Thereby, the weight of the container is held by the crane so that the seating devices on the bottom for bedding the metallurgical container need carry correspondingly less load and still be in a position to move; accordingly these can be designed with lesser costs. Further, as a result of this, the security during the handling of the metallurgy container is enhanced, especially because the container hangs in the crane at least during the tilting from a vertical position in a horizontal position.<br>
5<br><br>
As per a further proposal of the invention, the metallurgical container hanging in vertical positions with its bails on a load carrying device of a crane is tilted in the horizontal position through the gravitation force acting on it during the downward movement of the crane. In yet another advantageous design of the invention, the tilted container is engaged through a drive device, ideally a rope drive especially in an area lower half of the surface of the metallurgical container, pivoted around the axis of its journals and brought from the horizontal position in more or less a vertical position. It is possible according to the invention to tilt the metallurgical container almost on its head, that means with the bottom on the top, in order to be able to clean the ladle and/or to maintain it, to the extent such work can be easily carried out by placing the ladder in this position. From the point of view of device, the invention related task is solved through providing two pivot-mounted oscillating cranks/links arranged parallely to each other and distanced from one another with two open ends each, where at the open end of the oscillating crank a pocket-shaped seating is provided for the seating of a bail or a journal of the metallurgical container.<br>
Advantageously on the other open end of the oscillating crank, a weight is placed which acts as a counter-weight for the pocket-shaped seating provided on the opposite open end of the oscillating crank, and holds the oscillating crank with its pocket-shaped seating in a load-free condition, that is without the seated metallurgical container. In another design of the invention, a pneumatic and/or hydraulic cylinder engages the other open end of the oscillating crank which generates the holding force acting against the weight of the pocket-shaped seating, or supports the weight in its function.<br>
A further design of the invention visualizes that the moment generated by the open end of the oscillating crank having the pocket-shaped seating for locating a bail or a journal of the container is lesser when the metallurgical container is not engaged in the seating than the moment generated through the weight and/or pneumatic and/or hydraulic cylinder at the other open end of the oscillating crank.<br>
6<br><br>
Advantageously the moment generated at the open end of the oscillating crank having the pocket-shaped seating for locating a bail or a journal of the metallurgical container when the metallurgical container is seated is larger than the moment generated through the weight and/or the pneumatic and/or hydraulic cylinder at the other open end of the oscillating crank. The oscillating cranks have advantageously in the area of the other open end carrying elements acting in conjunction with the stopping elements provided on the metallurgical container. The carrying elements place themselves during the sinking of the metallurgical container in the pocket-shaped seating for latching of a bail or a journal of the container advantageously so that that the stopping devices provided against them in the metallurgical container during the sinking of the metallurgical container, the bottom part of the container oscillates upwards.<br>
Advantageously the pocket-shaped seating for latching a bail or a journal of the container at the open end of the oscillating crank is pivot-mounted. Thereby, the pocket-shaped seating during the turning and/or oscillating of the cranks can follow in such a manner that they find themselves always in a vertical position suitable for seating of a bail or a journal of the metallurgical container. In an advantageous design of the invention, the open end of the oscillating crank having a pocket-shaped seating for latching of a bail or a journal of the container has a device for positioning the pocket-shaped seating suitable for latching of a bail or a journal of the metallurgical container, ideally a stopping device which limits the movement of the pocket-shaped seating.<br>
A further design visualizes devices for limiting the movement of the cranks especially to be able to hold it in a defined and safe manner in vertical or horizontal position. Advantageously the devices are: a stopping device acting in conjunction with one open end of the oscillating crank having a pocket-shaped seating for latching of a bail or a journal of the container and another stopping device acting in conjunction with the other open end of the oscillating crank, ideally the weight provided at the other open of the crank.<br>
â¢?<br><br>
In an advantageous design of the invention, devices are visualized for adjusting the horizontal and/or vertical position of the metallurgical containers seated in the pocket-shaped seating. With these devices, to the extent required, a fine positioning of the container is enabled, for instance, to place the container exactly in the pocket-shaped seating, and to position the bottom of the container in a vertical position. Advantageously the devices are the short-lifting devices, ideally hydraulically or electro-mechanically activated short-lifting devices, which are located under the pocket-shaped seating and/or devices which can adjust the height of the stopping devices limiting the movement of the oscillating cranks, for instance, hydraulic plunger cylinder.<br>
A specially advantageous design of the invention visualizes devices for guiding the movement of the oscillating cranks and/or the pocket-shaped seatings. The oscillating cranks and/or the pocket-shaped seatings have for this purpose at least one bearing, preferably a roller bearing, which is guided during the movement of the oscillating cranks and/or the pocket-shaped seating in or along a arc-shaped curve, and thus fixes especially the pocket-shaped seatings in such a manner that the bails of the metallurgical container are guided always perpendicular to the earthed bottom. Through the guiding device, the movement of the oscillating cranks and/or the pocket-shaped seatings and thus the perpendicular position of the bails of the container are securely guided during the tilting of the container.<br>
In a further design of the invention, the oscillating cranks are jointed with one another preferably with the use of carriers which work in conjunction with the stopping devices provided on the container. A synchronous run of both the oscillating cranks can thus be preset/predetermined.<br><br>
In yet another design of the invention, the oscillating cranks are pivot-mounted respectively in a rack/stand, preferably made of steel, preferably eccentrically, that means especially deviating from the critical point of the oscillating cranks. The rack/stands are firmly provided on a bottom plate. In an especially advantageous design of the invention, the device is transportable, and for this purpose it is capable of being carried and transported by a load transporting device of a crane or of a floor conveyor. Also the bottom plate can be advantageously designed with bent right angles so that between the rack/stands a pit can be arranged. Advantageously the device has tools and devices for maintenance and/or repair work on the container, preferably assembly and disassembly devices for perforated bricks on the side of the spout of the container, flushing bricks, ladle slider and ladle slider ceramics, laser measuring instruments with and/or without spray robots and cleaning devices for the fire proof walling of the container.<br>
Further details, characteristics and advantages of the objective of the invention emerge from the following description of the accompanying drawings in which a preferred design form of the invention is schematically illustrated:<br>

Figure 7 A side view of a further design example of an invention-based device for fitting a ladle with a steel pouring ladle mounted/seated as per figure 1 and 2, after the tilting.<br>
Figure 1 and Figure 2 show a steel pouring ladle 1 known to the state-of-the-art of technology. The metallurgical container 1 of the pouring ladle is pivot-mounted in bails 3 equipped with journals 2 on the opposite sides of the upper area of the container 1. In the bottom area of the container 1 stopping devices 4 are provided on the opposite sides of the container, which serve the guiding and/or positioning of the container 1.<br>
Figure 3 and Figure 4 show a device for tilting a steel pouring ladle 1 as per figure 1 and 2 from a vertical position in a horizontal position. The device consists of two oscillating cranks parallel to each other and distanced from one another and pivot-mounted around the axis 10 in rack/stand 5. The oscillating cranks 6 have in the front two oscillating arms each primarily L-shapedr which are arranged primarily right angular to each other and have respectively an open end E1 and/or E2. At the open end E1 of the oscillating cranks 6, a pocket-shaped seating 8 for latching a bail 3 of the container 1 is pivot-mounted around the axis 9. At the other open end E2 of the crank 6, a weight 15 is provided.<br>
JO<br><br>
The oscillating arms of the crank 6, especially the distance a between the oscillating axis 10 and the axis 9 of the pocket-shaped seating 8, primarily u-shaped, for latching of a bail 3 of the container 1, and the distance b between the oscillating axis 10 and the weight 15 are so dimensioned and designed, that the moment generated when the metallurgical container 1 is not seated at the free end E1 of the crank 6 having the pocket-shaped seating 8 for latching a bail 3 of the metallurgical container 1 is lesser than the moment generated through the weight 15 on the other open end E2 of the crank 6, and is larger when the metallurgical container is seated.<br>
The oscillating cranks 6 have in the area of the other open end E2 carrier devices<br>
7	on the corresponding oscillating arm acting in conjunction with the stopping devices 4 provided on the container 1. Further, the oscillating arms have in the area of the open end E1 stopping device 11 on the corresponding oscillating arm for the purpose of restricting/limiting the movement of the pocket-shaped seating<br>
8	for the bearinged seating of a bail 3 of the container 1, through which the pivot-mounted pocket-shaped seating 8 around the axis 9 on the open end E1 of the crank 6 is maintained in a position suitable for the bearinged latching of a bail 3 of the container 1. The rack/stands 5 are made of steel and are welded/screw-fitted firmly with a bottom plate 14 made of steel. The distance between the rack/stands 5 is so designed that between them the metallurgical container 1 can be seated. The rack/stands 5 have stopping device 13 working in conjunction with the open-end E1 of the crank 6 having the pocket-shaped seating 8 for bearinged bedding of a bail 3 of the container 1, and stopping device 12 working in conjunction with the weight 15 at the other open end E2 of the crank 6. The stopping device 12 and 13 serve the purpose of limiting the movement of oscillating crank 6.<br>
11<br><br>
The pivot-mounted oscillating crank 6 are pressed by the weight 15 to the stopping device 12. In this position, the stopping devices 11 get fixed for the pivot-mounted pocket-shaped seating 8 in seating position for the vertically hanging bails 3 of the ladle 1. In seating position, the oscillating crank 6 remain -as illustrated in figure 3 and figure 5 - necessitated thereby that the moment weight 15 x distance/interval b is larger than the moment of the weight of the seating pocket 8 x distance a. Through a ladle 1, which with its weight presses vertically from top to bottom in the pocket-shaped seating 8 with force F and generates a larger moment than the moment from weight 15 x distance b, the oscillating crank 6 turn around the pivot axis 10 in an arc and/or a sectional arc, where the pocket-shaped seating 8, necessitated through its pivot-mounting around the axis 9 together with the ladle bails 3 seated in it remains always in vertical position.<br>
The steel ladle 1 hanging from the crane hooks is lowered by the crane and placed together with its bails 3 in the pocket-shaped seating 8. The oscillating crank 6 and/or pocked-shaped seating 8 yield to the weight and create an arc or a sectional arc towards the bottom in anti-clock direction, as can be recognized from figure 5 and figure 6. This arc and/or sectional arc towards the bottom follows during the lowering journey of the crane with its trolley travel. The ladle carriers 7 correspondingly create with the bottom part of the ladle 1 an arc towards the top in anti-clock direction, as can be recognized from figure 5 and 6. After the ladle was turned about 90Â° and lies horizontal, the pocket-shaped seating 8 places itself under the release of the weight of the crane on the seating pocket placement 13 and the bails 3 firmly in the pocket-shaped seating 8, and the ladle 1 lies horizontal. The crane can move away or fold its hooks from the bails 3. The removal of the ladle is done in the reverse sequence. The crane unfolds its hooks in the bail 3 and lifts the ladle. During the lifting journey, the crane follows the arc and/or sectional arc of the bail 3 with the trolley travel.<br>
I3r<br><br>
The crane can lift the ladle from the device without an intermediate stop. This can be guaranteed for instance in the main production hall of a steel plant as part of steel production with short-routes so that the tilting device can be placed at the edge of a hall as far a distance as the trolley travel of the crane allows it. The ladle to be repaired or maintained can be tilted during the lowering journal of the cranes without any loss of time so that the ladle bottom is within the crane path. Outside of the crane operation area under the crane path and bordering a neighbouring hall, the maintenance and repair work on the ladle surface is enabled immediately without any additional transport and other action points with the necessary subsidiary aggregates.<br>
While for instance a replacement of the ladle slider for conventional methodology would require about two hours of work and about two hours of eating time, the work with the tilting device can be carried out within the shortest time, about five to 10 minutes so that the availability of the ladle can be enhanced by almost four hours. Correspondingly the cost savings on transporting the ladles, on floor vehicles, cranes, ladle fire, personnel and such other requirements is substantia).<br>
In the design example of a device illustrated in figure 7 with seated and tilted ladle 1, for tilting a ladle 1 according to figure 1 and 2 from a vertical position in a horizontal position, the stopping devices 13 limiting the movement of the oscillating cranks 6 or the pocket-shaped seating 8 with the use of plunge cylinders 16 are designed as short-lifting devices with height adjustment, especially to align the basement/bottom 17 of the ladle 1 in a vertical position to the bottom plate 14 and/or to the earthed bottom.<br>
The design examples illustrated in the drawings serve merely to explain the invention and are not limited to these.<br>
