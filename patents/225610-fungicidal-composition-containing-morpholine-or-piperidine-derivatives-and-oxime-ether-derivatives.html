The physical data of these compounds and processes for their preparation are given in the already mentioned WO 96/19442, DE 197441098.7 and DE 19741099.5.<br>
The ratios of the compounds I and II can be varied within wide ranges; the active compounds are preferably employed in a ratio by weight in the range from 20:1 to 1:20, in particular 10:1 to 1:10.<br>
When preparing the mixtures, it is preferred to employ the pure active ingredients I and II, to which further active ingredients against harmful fungi or other pests, such as insects, arachnids or nematodes, or else herbicidal or growth-regulating active ingredients or fertilizers can be admixed.<br>
The mixtures of the compounds I and II, or the compounds I and II used simultaneously, jointly or separately, exhibit outstanding activity against a wide range of phytopathogenic fungi, in particular from the classes of the Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes, Phycomycetes and Deuteromycetes. Some of them act systemically and can therefore be employed as foliar- and soil-acting fungicides.<br>
They are especially important for controlling a large number of fungi in a variety of crop plants, such as cotton, vegetable species (e.g. cucumbers, beans, tomatoes, potatoes and cucurbits), barley, grass, oats, bananas, coffee, maize, fruit species, rice, rye, soya, grapevine, wheat, ornamentals, sugar cane, and a variety of seeds.<br>
They are particularly suitable for controlling the following phytopathogenic fungi: Erysiphe graminis (powdery mildew) in cereals, Erysiphe cichoracearum and Sphaerotheca fuliginea in cucurbits, Podosphaera leucotricha in apples, Uncinula necator in grapevines, Puccinia species in cereals, Rhizoctonia species in cotton, rice and lawns, Ustilago species in cereals and sugar cane, Venturia inaequalis (scab) in apples, Helminthosporium species in cereals, Septoria nodorum in wheat, Botrytis cinera (gray mold) in strawberries, vegetables, ornamentals and grapevines, Cercospora arachidicola in groundnuts, Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides in wheat and barley, Pyricularia oryzae in rice, Phytophthora infestans in potatoes and tomatoes, Plasmopara viticola in grapevines, Pseudoperonospora species in hops and cucumbers, Alternaria species in vegetables and fruit, Mycosphaerella species in bananas and Fusarium and Verticillium species.<br><br>
They can furthermore be employed in the protection of materials (for example the protection of wood), for example against Paecilomyces variotii.<br>
The compounds I and II can be applied simultaneously, that is either together or separately, or successively, the sequence, in the case of separate application, generally not having any effect on the result of the control measures.<br>
Depending on the kind of effect desired, the application rates of the mixtures according to the invention are, in particular in agricultural crop areas, from 0.01 to 10 kg/ha, preferably 0.1 to 5 kg/ha, in particular 0.2 to 3.0 kg/ha.<br>
The application rates of the compounds I are from 0.01 to 2.5 kg/ha, preferably 0.01 to 10 kg/ha, in particular 0.05 to 5.0 kg/ha.<br>
Correspondingly, in the case of the compounds II, the application rates are from 0.01 to 2 kg/ha, preferably 0.02 to 2 kg/ha, in particular 0.02 to 1.0 kg/ha.<br>
For seed treatment, the application rates of the mixture are generally from 0.001 to 250 g/kg of seed, preferably 0.01 to 100 g/kg, in particular 0.01 to 50 g/kg.<br>
If phytopathogenic harmful fungi are to be controlled, the separate or joint application of the compounds I and II or of the mixtures of the compounds I and II is effected by spraying or dusting the seeds, the plants or the soils before or after sowing of the plants, or before or after plant emergence.<br>
The fungicidal synergistic mixtures according to the invention or the compounds I and II can be formulated for example in the form of ready-to-spray solutions, powder and suspensions or in the form of highly concentrated aqueous, oily or other suspensions, dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, dusts, materials for broadcasting or granules, and applied by spraying, atomizing, dusting, broadcasting or watering. The use form depends on the intended purpose; in any case, it should ensure as fine and uniform as possible a distribution of the mixture according to the invention.<br>
The formulations are prepared in a known manner, e.g. by extending the active compound with solvents and/or carriers, if desired using emulsifiers and dispersants, it being possible also to use other organic solvents as auxiliary solvents if water is<br><br>
used as the diluent. Suitable auxiliaries for this purpose are essentially: solvents such as aromatics (e.g. xylene), chlorinated aromatics (e.g. chlorobenzenes), paraffins (e.g. mineral oil fractions), alcohols (e.g. methanol, butanol), ketones (e.g. cyclohexanone), amines (e.g. ethanolamine, dimethylformamide) and water; carriers such as ground natural minerals (e.g. kaolins, clays, talc, chalk) and ground synthetic minerals (e.g. finely divided silica, silicates); emulsifiers such as nonionic and anionic emulsifiers (e.g. polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, alkylsulfonates and arylsulfonates) and dispersants such as lignosulfite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Suitable surfactants are the alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts and ammonium salts of aromatic sulfonic acids, e.g. ligno-, phenol-, naphthalene- and dibutylnaphthalenesulfonic acid, and of fatty acids, alkyl- and alkylarylsulfonates, alkyl, lauryl ether and fatty alcohol sulfates, and salts of sulfated hexa-, hepta- and octadecanols, or of fatty alcohol glycol ethers, condensates of sulfonated naphthalene and its derivatives with formaldehyde, condensates of naphthalene or of the naphthalenesulfonic acids with phenol and formaldehyde, polyoxyethylene octylphenol ether, ethoxylated isooctyl-, octyl-or nonylphenol, alkylphenol or tributylphenyl polyglycol ethers, alkylaryl polyether alcohols, isotridecyl alcohol, fatty alcohol/ethylene oxide condensates, ethoxylated castor oil, polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers or polyoxypropylene, lauryl alcohol polyglycol ether acetate, sorbitol esters, lignosulfite waste liquors or methylcellulose.<br>
Powders [lacuna] materials for broadcasting and dusts can be prepared by mixing or jointly grinding the compounds I or II or the mixture of the compounds I and II with a solid carrier.<br>
Granules (e.g. coated granules, impregnated granules or homogeneous granules) are usually prepared by binding the active compound, or active compounds, to a solid carrier.<br>
Fillers or solid carriers are, for example, mineral earths, such as silicas, silica gels, silicates, talc, kaolin, limestone, lime, chalk, bole, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, ground synthetic materials and fertilizers, such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas, and products of vegetable origin, such as cereal meal, tree bark meal, wood meal and nutshell meal, cellulose powders or other solid carriers.<br><br>
The formulations generally comprise from 0.1 to 95% by weight, preferably 0.5 to 90% by weight, of one of the compounds I or II or of the mixture of the compounds I and II. The active compounds are employed in a purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably 95% to 100% (according to NMR spectrum or HPLC spectrum [sic]).<br>
The compounds I or II, the mixtures, or the corresponding formulations, are applied by treating the harmful fungi, their habitat, or the plants, seeds, soils, areas, materials or spaces to be kept free from them with a fungicidally effective amount of the mixture, or of the compounds I and II in the case of separate application.<br>
Application can be effected before or after infection by the harmful fungi.<br>
Examples of such preparations comprising the active compounds are:<br>
I.	A solution of 90 parts by weight of the active compounds and 10 parts by weight of N-methylpyrrolidone; this solution is suitable for use in the form of microdrops;<br>
II.

VI.	An intimate mixture of 3 parts by weight of the active compounds and 97 parts by weight of finely divided kaolin; this dust comprises 3% by weight of active compound;<br>
VII.	An intimate mixture of 30 parts by weight of the active compounds, 92 parts by weight of pulverulent silica gel and 8 parts by weight of paraffin oil which had been sprayed onto the surface of this silica gel; this formulation imparts good adhesion to the active compound;<br>
VIII.	A stable aqueous dispersion of 40 parts by weight of the active compounds, 10 parts by weight of the sodium salt of a phenolsulfonic acid/urea/formaldehyde condensate, 2 parts by weight of silica gel and 48 parts by weight of water; this dispersion may be diluted further;<br>
IX.	A stable oily dispersion of 20 parts by weight of the active compounds, 2 parts by weight of the calcium salt of dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, 8 parts by weight of fatty alcohol polyglycol ether, 20 parts by weight of the sodium salt of a phenolsulfonic acid/urea/formaldehyde condensate and 88 parts by weight of a paraffinic mineral oil.<br>
Use Example<br>
The synergistic activity of the mixtures according to the invention can be demonstrated by the following experiments:<br>
The active compounds, separately or together, are formulated as a 10% emulsion in a mixture of 63% by weight of cyclohexanone and 27% by weight of emulsifier, and diluted with water to the desired concentration.<br>
Evaluation is carried out by determining the infected leaf areas in percent. These percentages are converted into efficacies. The efficacy (W) is calculated as follows using Abbot's formula:<br>
W = (1 - a/p)-100<br>
a  corresponds to the fungal infection of the treated plants in<br>
% and P   corresponds to the fungal infection of the untreated<br>
(control) plants in %<br>
An efficacy of 0 means that the infection level of the treated plants corresponds to that of the untreated control plants; an efficacy of 100 means that the treated plants were not infected.<br>
The expected efficacies of the mixtures of the active compounds were determined using Colby's formula [R.S. Colby, Weeds 15.,<br><br>
20-22 (1967)]-and compared with the observed efficacies. Colby's formula: E = x + y - x-y/100<br>
E   expected efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control,<br>
when using the mixture of the active compounds A and B at the<br>
concentrations a and b X  efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using<br>
active compound A at a concentration of a y  efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using<br>
active compound B at a concentration of b.<br>
Use Example 1 - Activity against mildew of wheat<br>
Leaves of potted wheat seedlings cv. "Kanzler" were sprayed to runoff point with an aqueous preparation of active compound which was prepared from a stock solution comprising 10% of active compound, 63% of cyclohexanone and 27% of emulsifier and, 24 h after the spray coating had dried on, dusted with spores of mildew of wheat (Erysiphe graminis forma specialis tritici). The test plants were subsequently placed in climatized chambers at 20-24OC and 60-90% relative atmospheric humidity for 7 days. The extent of the development of the infection on the leaves was then determined visually.<br>
The visually determined values for the percentage of infected leaf areas were converted into efficacies as % of the untreated control. An efficacy of 0 means the same degree of infection as in the untreated control, an efficacy of 100 means 0% infection. The expected efficacies for active compound combinations were determined using Colby's formula (Colby, S.R. "Calculating synergistic and antagonistic responses of herbicide combinations", Weeds, 15 (1967), 20-22) and compared with the observed efficacies.<br>
The components II used were the compounds 11.79 and 11.138 from Table 2.<br>
