				<td>Related Application<br>
This application is divided out of Indian Patent Application No.<br>
IN/PCT/2001/01120 (hereinafter referred to as the "parent" application).<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to pressure relief systems. More<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to an improved rupture disk<br>
assembly for a pressure relief system and to apparatuses and methods<br>
-for forming and manufacturing rupture disks.<br>
Pressure relief assemblies are commonly used as safety<br>
devices in systems containing pressurized fluids in gas or liquid form.<br>
A pressure relief assembly will vent fluid from the system when the<br>
pressure in the system reaches an unsafe level. A number of<br>
emergency conditions, including fire and system failure, can create<br>
dangerous pressure levels, which require immediate relief to preserve<br>
the safety of the system.<br>
Generally, a pressure relief assembly includes a rupture disk<br>
that is sealed between a pair of support members, or safety heads.<br>
The pressure relief assembly is then typically clamped, or otherwise<br>
sealingly disposed, between a pair of conventional pipe flanges in the<br>
pressurized system. One of the pipes conducts pressurized fluid to<br>
one side of the pressure relief assembly and the other pipe provides an<br>
outlet to a safety reservoir or may be open to the environment. The<br>
support members include a central opening that exposes a portion of<br>
the rupture disk to the pressurized fluid in the system. The exposed<br>
portion of the rupture disk will rupture when the pressure of the fluid<br>
reaches a predetermined differential pressure between the inlet and<br>
outlet sides. The ruptured disk creates a vent path that allows fluid to<br>
escape through the outlet to reduce the pressure in the system.<br>
Rupture disks typically have a dome shape and can be either<br>
forward acting or reverse acting, in a forward acting disk, the concave<br>
side of the dome faces the pressurized fluid, placing the material of the<br><br>
disk under tension. In a reverse acting disk, the convex side of the<br>
dome faces the pressurized fluid, placing the material of the disk under<br>
compression. In the reverse acting disk (also known as a reverse<br>
buckling disk), when the pressure of the fluid exceeds the<br>
5 predetermined level and the material of the disk structure cannot<br>
withstand the pressure, the dome of the disk will buckle and begin to<br>
reverse. This reversal, or buckling/will begin at a particular point on<br>
the disk, known as the point of initial reversal. As the disk continues to<br>
reverse, the material of the disk is torn by an opening means to create<br>
10 the vent path to release the pressurized fluid.<br>
Both types of disks commonly include score lines (areas of<br>
weakness) to facilitate the opening of the disk. In a reverse buckling<br>
disk, the disk will tear along the score line when the disk is reversing.<br>
Selected portions of the disk are usually left unscored, acting as a<br>
15 hinge area, to prevent the disk from fragmenting upon bursting and<br>
escaping along with the pressurized fluid. Additionally, pressure relief<br>
assemblies are known that include safety members to assist in opening<br>
the disk and to absorb the energy created by the bursting of the disk to<br>
attempt to prevent the disk from fragmenting.<br>
20	In an emergency situation, where the system pressure becomes<br>
unsafe, it is important to reduce the pressure as quickly as possible.<br>
The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) code<br>
establishes minimum performance requirements for fluid flow rates<br>
through pressure relief systems. The size and shape of the opening<br>
25 created when the disk bursts is a limiting factor on the rate at which<br>
fluid can escape the system. A burst disk having a large, unobstructed<br>
opening will perform better than a burst disk having a small, obstructed<br>
opening because the velocity head loss (i.e. pressure drop) over the<br>
large, unobstructed opening will be lower than the velocity head loss<br>
30 over a smaller or obstructed opening. The lower velocity head loss<br>
translates to a lower flow resistance (Kr) and, thus, a greater flow rate<br>
through the disk.<br><br>
Adjusting different facets of the disk design, including the size of<br>
the rupturable portion of the disk and the location of the score line, can<br>
control the size and shape of the opening created when the disk bursts.<br>
A larger disk has the potential to create a larger opening.<br>
5	Another factor affecting flow resistance is the nature of the fluid<br>
in the pressurized system. It has been found that rupture disks open<br>
differently depending on the nature of the fluid in the system. Typically,<br>
a disk burst in a gas environment will open more fully than a disk burst<br>
 in a liquid environment. Thus, to meet desirable flow resistance performance requirements, the design of a disk may have to be<br>
different if the disk is being used in a liquid application, even if the<br>
liquid is at the same pressure as a similar gas application.<br>
An additional factor of disk design that affects flow resistance is<br>
the thickness of the rupturable portion of the disk. A disk made of a<br>
15 thinner material will bend easier than a disk made of a thicker material.<br>
Thus, for disks rupturing at the same fluid pressure, a thinner disk is<br>
more likely to completely open and create a large, unobstructed<br>
opening than a corresponding thicker disk.<br>
However, a disk made of a thinner material is more susceptible<br>
20 to damage than a thicker disk. Any damage to the rupture disk could<br>
alter the actual burst pressure of the disk. This is particularly an issue<br>
in low pressure, reverse buckling disks where the disk material must be<br>
thin to burst at the desired low pressure. The thinner, low pressure<br>
disks are more likely to be damaged during installation, which may<br>
25 compromise the structural integrity of the disk and cause the disk to<br>
reverse at a pressure significantly less than the desired rupture<br>
pressure. In these situations, the material of the disk does not tear as<br>
expected and the disk may completely reverse without tearing. The<br>
reverse buckling disk then acts like a forward acting disk and the fluid<br>
30 pressure places the material of the disk in tension. Because the tensile<br>
strength of the disk material is greater than the corresponding<br>
compressive strength, the disk may not tear to create the vent path<br><br>
until the pressure of the system significantly exceeds the desired<br>
rupture pressure. This over-pressure condition could result in damage<br>
to the system that the rupture disk was intended to prevent.<br>
Rupture disks are rated by their performance in a damaged<br>
5 condition. This rating is generally known as the damage safety ratio of<br>
the disk and is determined by dividing the actual pressure at which a<br>
damaged disk ruptures by the desired, or rated, rupture pressure of the<br>
disk. A damaged disk with a damage safety ratio of 1 or less will burst<br>
at the desired rupture pressure, or before the pressurized fluid reaches<br>
10 the desired pressure, thereby preventing any damage to the system.<br>
Another important performance rating of a rupture disk is the<br>
burst accuracy of the disk. There are variations in materials,<br>
manufacturing, and installation that may result in any given two disks in<br>
a manufacturing lot of seemingly identical disks not bursting at the<br>
15 same pressures. Thus, there is typically a variation in actual burst<br>
pressure among disks having the same rated pressure. With current<br>
rupture disk design and manufacturing methods, rupture disks will<br>
typically burst at a pressure that is less than 5% of the rated pressure<br>
or less than 2 psig when the rated pressure is below 40 psig. Thus, to<br>
20 prevent premature disk rupture and to provide a safety margin, the<br>
standard operating pressure of a system should not exceed 90% of the<br>
rated pressure of a rupture disk used in the system.<br>
In light of the foregoing, there is a need for a pressure relief<br>
assembly that provides a low flow resistance Kr in both liquid and gas<br>
25 applications. There is further a need for rupture disks that have an<br>
accurate and repeatable burst pressure and thus can be used in a high<br>
operating capacity. There is still further a need for a rupture disk<br>
having a low damage safety ratio so that an inadvertently damaged<br>
reverse buckling disk does not create a potentially dangerous over-<br>
30 pressure situation in either liquid or gas applications.<br>

perimeter and into a mold having a concave shape. The central portion<br><br>
of the blank is formed into a domed shape that generally corresponds<br>
to the concave shape of the moid. A member is engaged with centra!<br>
portion of the blank as the central portion is formed into the domed<br>
shape to form an indentation at or near the apex of the domed shape.<br>
5	According to yet another aspect, the present invention is<br>
directed to a rupture disk assembly to be sealed in a pressurized<br>
system. The assembly includes a rupture disk that is configured to<br>

and has a series of internally threaded bolt holes 43 (only one of which<br>
is illustrated in Fig. 1) surrounding the inlet bore. Outlet support<br>
member 32 defines an outlet bore 36 and has a series of bolt holes 41<br>
(only one of which is illustrated in Fig. 1) that correspond to bolt holes<br>
43	of inlet support member 30. It is contemplated that the inlet and<br>
outlet support members may be safety heads, pipe flanges, or any<br>
combination of structures capable of sealingly engaging the rupture<br>
disk with a pressurized system.<br>
As also shown in Fig. 1, a rupture disk 44 is positioned between<br>
inlet support member 30 and outlet support member 32. Rupture disk<br>
44	includes a flange 48 and a rupturable portion 45. Flange 48 is<br>
connected to rupturable portion 45 by transition area 49. It is<br>
contemplated that the rupture disk and safety member of the present<br>
invention can also be utilized in sanitary environments, wherein well-<br>
known sanitary fittings will be utilized to engage the rupture disk.<br>
Rupturable portion 45 has a dome shape that includes a<br>
concave surface 46 and a convex surface 47 that define a dome area<br>
designated generally as 35. When flange 48 is engaged with inlet and<br>
outlet support members 30 and 32, rupturable portion 45 aligns with<br><br>
inlet bore 34 and outlet bore 36. In a preferred embodiment, convex<br>
surface 47 extends into inlet bore 34 and concave surface faces outlet<br>
bore 36. It is contemplated, however, that aspects of the present<br>
invention may be utilized in forward acting disks where the convex<br>
surface extends into the outlet bore.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 2, rupturable portion 45 includes a score<br>
line 80 that has a first end 84 and a second end 86. Preferably, score<br>
line 80 transcribes an arc of approximately 300° in the concave surface<br>
of the dome-shaped rupturable portion. The present invention can be<br>
utilized with score lines of various configurations, such as, for example,<br>
an intermittent score line where the score generally transcribes an arc,<br>
but includes a series of gaps of unscored material. The score line may<br>
also completely circumscribe the rupturable portion of the disk, but<br>
include a section where the depth of the score line is shallower than<br>
the remainder of the score line. For purposes of the present invention,<br>
the points at which the depth of the score line changes would be<br>
considered to be the first and second ends of the score line.<br>
As described in greater detail below, score line 80 creates a line<br>
of weakness in the rupturable portion along which the disk material will<br>
tear when exposed to a fluid having a predetermined pressure. While<br>
the presently preferred embodiment provides the score line on the<br>
dome itself, the score line may be provided in other locations, such as,<br>
for example, the transition area between the dome and the flange of<br>
the disk or on the flange itself.<br>
Referring again to Fig 1, a positioning pin 68 preferably extends<br>
between inlet support member 30 and outlet support member 32 and<br>
through flange 48 of rupture disk 44. Positioning pin 68 ensures that<br>
inlet support member 30 is properly aligned with outlet support member<br>
32 and that rupture disk 44 is properly positioned between support<br>
members 30 and 32. When the assembly is properly positioned, inlet<br>
bore 34 aligns with outlet bore 36 to create a fluid passageway that is<br>
blocked by rupturable portion 45 of rupture disk 44. Additional<br><br>
positioning pins may be placed in a symmetrical or asymmetrical<br>
pattern around the support members to further control the relative<br>
positions of the rupture disk and support members.<br>
A series of cap screws 40 (only one of which is illustrated in Fig.<br>
1) are disposed through bolt holes 41 to engage internally threaded<br>
bolt holes 43. Preferably, bolt holes 41 in outlet support member 32<br>
include a counter bore 42 to receive the head of cap screw 40. The<br>
engagement of cap screws 40 with bolt holes 41 and 43 draws outlet<br>
support member 32 towards inlet support member 30 to sealingly<br>
engage flange 48 of rupture disk 44.<br>
Preferably, inlet support member 30 includes a raised seating<br>
surface 78 and outlet support member 32 includes a corresponding<br>
seating surface 79 to engage flange 48 of rupture disk 44. It is<br>
contemplated that seating surface 78 may include a bite seal, or other<br>
similar sealing device, to create a seal with the flange. Alternatively, an<br>
o-ring or gasket may be positioned between inlet support member 30<br>
and flange 48 to create the seal.<br>
As is shown in Fig. 1, pressure relief assembly 20 is positioned<br>
between a circular inlet pipe 22 and a circular outlet pipe 28. Inlet pipe<br>
22 includes an inlet fluid pathway 64 and an inlet pipe flange 24. Outlet<br>
pipe 28 includes an outlet fluid pathway 66 and an outlet pipe flange<br>
26.<br>
Preferably, inlet pipe flange 24 includes a raised surface 74 that<br>
engages a corresponding surface 75 on inlet support member 30 and<br>
outlet pipe flange 26 includes a raised surface 76 that engages a<br>
corresponding surface 77 on outlet support member 26. A series of<br>
bolt members 60 draw inlet pipe flange 24 towards outlet pipe flange<br>
26 to create a seal with the pressure relief assembly 20.<br>
Preferably, a U-shaped positioning fixture 38 extending from<br>
inlet support member 30 engages an opening 58 in inlet pipe flange 24<br>
to ensure pressure relief assembly 20 is properly oriented between the<br>
pipe flanges. U-shaped positioning fixture 38 also ensures that inlet<br><br>
support member 30 is placed adjacent inlet pipe flange 24 and, thus,<br>
prevents pressure relief assembly 20 from being installed upside down<br>
in the pipe flanges. Pressure relief assembly 20 is properly positioned<br>
between inlet pipe flange 24 and outlet pipe flange 26 when inlet fluid<br>
pathway 64 aligns with inlet bore 34, outlet bore 36, and outlet fluid<br>
pathway 66 to create a fluid passageway that is blocked by rupturable<br>
portion 45 of rupture disk 44.<br>
Inlet pipe 22 is connected to a system or vessel (not shown) that<br>
contains a pressurized fluid. The fluid may be in either gas or liquid<br>
form. Inlet pipe 22 conducts the pressurized fluid to pressure relief<br>
assembly 20 and the exposed rupturable portion 45 of rupture disk 44.<br>
Rupturable portion 45 is'configured to burst when the pressure of the<br>
fluid reaches a predetermined level that is indicative of an over-<br>
pressurization in the system or vessel. The burst pressure of the disk<br>
may be controlled by varying different parameters of the disk design,<br>
including, but not limited to, the height of the domed section, the<br>
thickness of the disk, and the depth and location of the score line.<br>
When the disk bursts and tears along score line 80, an opening<br>
through the disk is created. The opening allows the fluid to flow from<br>
inlet bore 34 to outlet bore 36 and into outlet fluid pathway 66, thereby<br>
reducing the pressure in the system or vessel. Outlet fluid pathway 66<br>
may release the fluid to the environment or to a safety reservoir (not<br>
shown) depending upon the nature of the fluid in the system or vessel.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the pressure relief<br>
assembly includes a safety member disposed adjacent the concave<br>
surface of the rupture disk. The safety member includes a hinge<br>
having a knuckle that extends downwardly into the dome area created<br>
by the rupturable portion of the disk and extends laterally across the<br>
dome area to a point that is inside the area circumscribed by the score<br>
line or inside the area circumscribed by an arc connecting the two ends<br>
of the score line. A tongue extends away from the knuckle and into the<br>
outlet bore of the outlet support member in a direction generally<br><br>
perpendicular to the flange of the safety member. Preferably, the<br>
tongue extends past the flange of the safety member, although the end<br>
of the tongue may generally align with plane created by the flange.<br>
The present invention contemplates that the hinge may be angled with<br>
respect to the flange, such that the hinge extends into the outlet bore<br>
and towards the outlet support member. It is further contemplated that<br>
the hinge may have a generally flat configuration.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 1, a safety member 50 is positioned<br>
between rupture disk 44 and outlet support member 32 and generally<br>
supports the transition area of the rupture disk. Preferably, safety<br>
member 50 is a separate structure from rupture disk 44 and from outlet<br>
support member 32. It is contemplated, however, that safety member<br>
50 may be integral with or connected to either rupture disk 44 or outlet<br>
support member 32 with spot welds or in any other manner to keep the<br>
structures together.<br>
Safety member 50 includes a flange 62 and a hinge 52. Flange<br>
62 of safety member 50 has substantially the same general shape as<br>
flange 48 of rupture disk 44 and is sealed in pressure relief assembly<br>
20 between the rupture disk flange and outlet support member 32.<br>
Preferably, as shown in Fig. 2, flange 62 includes a series of holes 82<br>
that may be engaged by positioning pin 68 (referring to Fig. 1).<br>
As shown in Fig. 3a, hinge 52 includes a knuckle 53 and a<br>
tongue 54. Knuckle 53 extends from flange 62 into dome area 35. In<br>
the illustrated embodiment, knuckle 53 is linear in cross-section. It is<br>
contemplated, however, that knuckle 53 may have other cross-<br>
sections, such as, for example, a curved cross-section that generally<br>
follows the contour of the rupturable portion. Preferably, knuckle 53<br>
does not contact rupturable portion 45 and, thus, leaves a gap 51<br>
between the knuckle and the rupturable portion. It is contemplated,<br>
however, that knuckle 53 may contact rupturable portion 45 when the<br>
rupture disk is in an unruptured state.<br><br>
-15-<br>
Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, the outer edge of knuckle 53 extends<br>
downwardly into dome area 35. Outer edge 53 also extends laterally<br>
across dome area 35 to a point that is inside the area circumscribed by<br>
score line 80 or inside the area circumscribed by an arc connecting the<br>
ends 84 and 86 of score line 80. The outer edge of knuckle 53 forms a<br>
generally straight line about which the rupturable portion will bend<br>
when the rupture disk ruptures. In a presently preferred embodiment,<br>
the outer edge 53 extends to a point inside, but directly adjacent to the<br>
area circumscribed by the score line 80 or the area circumscribed by<br>
an arc 85 connecting the two ends of the score line. This embodiment<br>
of the hinge prevents fragmentation, yet maximizes the size of the<br>
opening created when the disk ruptures, thereby minimizing the<br>
pressure drop, or velocity head loss, over the ruptured disk and<br>
achieving a low flow resistance, Kr<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, hinge 52 is formed with a first pocket 90 and<br>
a second pocket 92. First and second pockets preferably have a<br>
concave shape that faces gap 51 (referring to Fig. 3b) between knuckle<br>
53 and rupturable portion 45 of rupture disk 44. Preferably, first and<br>
second pockets 90 and 92 are positioned adjacent first and second<br>
ends 84 and 86 of score line 80, respectively. It is contemplated that<br>
first and second ends 84 and 86 of score line 80 may terminate at a<br>
point directly below first and second pockets 90 and 92, respectively<br>
(as illustrated in Fig. 2). Alternatively, first and second ends 84 and 86<br>
of score line may terminate at a point that is directly aligned with or just<br>
short of first and second pockets 90 and 92, respectively.<br>
As illustrated in Figs. 1-4, tongue 54 extends away from knuckle<br>
53 and into outlet bore 36. Preferably, as shown in Fig. 2, tongue 54<br>
includes a main linear section 55 with two substantially straight side<br>
flaps 56 that project from the main linear section 55 towards the outlet<br>
safety member 32. Preferably, as shown in Fig. 2, the angle 87<br>
between side flaps 56 and main linear section 55 is obtuse, although<br>
the present invention contemplates that angle 87 may be a right angle<br><br>
-16-<br>
or an acute angle. More preferably, angle 87 is greater than the angle<br>
between main linear section 55 and a line of radius 89 extending<br>
through the corresponding end of main linear section 55. Still more<br>
preferably, angle 87 is within the range of about 130° to 160°.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 1, side flaps 56 extend<br>
towards outlet safety member 32. Preferably, side flaps 56 are in close<br>
proximity to, but do not contact outlet safety member 32 when the disk<br>
is in an unruptured state.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, and as illustrated in Fig. 3b,<br>
tongue 54 includes a tongue support 57 that projects from the end of<br>
the tongue towards outlet support member 32. Preferably, tongue<br>
support 57 extends to a point that is in close proximity to, but not in<br>
contact with, outlet support member 32. It is contemplated that other<br>
embodiments of the support structure will be readily apparent to one<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, safety member 50 preferably includes a<br>
series of stress risers 88. Each stress riser 88 extends away from<br>
flange 62 and into dome area 35 of rupturable portion 45 of the rupture<br>
disk. Each stress riser 88 terminates in one or more stress<br>
concentrating points. Preferably, the stress concentrating points of at<br>
least two of the stress risers are aligned with score line 80 in rupturable<br>
portion 45 of the rupture disk. The stress concentrating points, as<br>
explained in greater detail below, contact the rupturable portion of the<br>
rupture disk when the rupture disk reverses to ensure the rupturable<br>
portion tears to create a flow path for fluid to escape.<br>
The safety member may include recessed, or "scalloped out,"<br>
areas between each stress riser. These "scalloped out" areas create<br>
gaps in the support of the transition area of the rupture disk. As also<br>
explained in greater detail below, the gaps in the support of the rupture<br>
disk also help ensure that the rupturable portion tears to create a flow<br>
path for fluid to escape. These scalloped out areas may be located at<br>
a few selected locations around the safety member annulus or may<br><br>
-17-<br>
alternatively be regularly spaced around the entire annulus or<br>
substantially the entire annulus (e.g. exclusive of the hinge area).<br>
As described above and referring to Fig. 1, inlet fluid pathway 64<br>
conducts pressurized fluid, in either gas or liquid form, to inlet bore 34<br>
and to rupturable portion 45 of rupture disk 44. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, the pressurized fluid contacts convex surface 47 of<br>
rupture disk 44, thereby placing the material of the disk under a<br>
compressive force. The magnitude of the compressive force<br>
corresponds to the pressure of the fluid. When the pressure of the fluid<br>
reaches a predetermined level and the compressive force exceeds the<br>
structural and material strength of the rupturable portion of the rupture<br>
disk, the dome-shaped section will begin to buckle, or reverse.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 5, the reversal of the disk will cause the disk<br>
to tear along score line 80 to form a disk petal 103 that has a shape<br>
defined by score line 80 and a disk hinge 102 that connects disk petal<br>
103 to flange 48 to prevent the disk from fragmenting. Under the<br>
continued fluid pressure, disk hinge 102 will bend, with respect to the<br>
flange, through gap 51 towards safety member 50. Because knuckle<br>
53 of safety member 50 is close to disk hinge 102, the momentum<br>
gained by the disk hinge will be relatively small and will be arrested by<br>
the eventual contact with the knuckle before the disk petal gains<br>
enough momentum to tear away from the disk hinge.<br>
If the disk does not tear along the score line during the initial<br>
buckling of the disk, the disk will continue to buckle and reverse under<br>
the pressure of the fluid until the disk contacts the stress concentrating<br>
points of stress risers 88. The stress concentrating points will increase<br>
the stress in the score line 80 to facilitate opening of the disk. In<br>
addition, the unsupported gaps of the transition area, as defined by the<br>
shape of the "scalloped out" areas of the safety member, create<br>
additional forces in the rupturable portion of the disk to ensure the disk<br>
opens to create a vent path for the fluid.<br><br>
-18-<br>
After the rupturable portion tears and the disk hinge 102 is<br>
supported by knuckle 53, the force of the fluid pressure and the<br>
momentum of disk petal 103 will cause the disk to bend around the<br>
outer edge of knuckle 53. The petal will continue to bend around<br>
knuckle 53 until contacting tongue 54 of hinge 50. The contact of disk<br>
petal 103 with tongue 54 will bend the tongue until side flaps 56 contact<br>
outlet safety member 32. The portions of disk petal 103 that extend on<br>
either side of tongue 54 will wrap around the tongue and contact side<br>
flaps 56.<br>
Depending upon the pressure in the system and the momentum<br>
with which the petal is moving, tongue 54 and side flaps 56 may further<br>
bend and deform with the contact of disk petal 103 to absorb the kinetic<br>
energy of the moving disk petal and stop the movement of the disk<br>
petal. Preferably, side flaps 56 are angled with respect to the outlet<br>
support member so that they may bend outwardly, or inwardly<br>
depending upon angle 87, if the force of contact with the moving petal<br>
is great enough. By absorbing the kinetic energy of the moving disk<br>
petal, the tongue reduces the overall force on the disk petal, thereby<br>
preventing the disk petal from fragmenting. The dimensions of the<br>
hinge and, in particular, the dimensions of the knuckle and tongue, are<br>
selected so that the hinge will effectively absorb the kinetic energy of<br>
the disk petal, while achieving a large and unobstructed flow path<br>
through which the pressurized fluid may vent.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, the portions of the disk petal<br>
surrounding the end of the score line will fold into pockets 90 and 92 of<br>
hinge 50. Pockets 90 and 92 extend generally away from the flange 62<br>
of the safety member and in the direction of the outlet bore. Pockets<br>
90 and 92 have curved surfaces and are configured to receive the<br>
portions of the rupture disk adjacent the respective ends 84 and 86 of<br>
score line 80 without creating any additional stress concentrating<br>
points. The pockets provide support for the rupture disk +material<br>
adjacent the ends of the score line. This reduces the tensile forces<br><br>
-19-<br>
acting on the ends of score line to prevent the tear in the rupture disk<br>
from continuing past the ends of the score line. Thus, the pockets help<br>
in preventing the petal from completely separating from the disk. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the disk reverses symmetrically and the disk<br>
will wrap around the opposing pockets at the same time thereby<br>
preventing the creation of any uneven stresses in either side of the disk<br>
hinge.<br>
The opening created by the rupture of the disk will be defined by<br>
the shape and location of the score line and by the shape and location<br>
of the hinge. In the preferred embodiment, the score line and hinge are<br>
configured to maximize the size of the opening. It is contemplated that<br>
the shape of the hinge, as defined by the first pocket, the second<br>
pocket, and the outer edge of the knuckle, may be a generally straight<br>
line Alternatively, as illustrated in Fig. 2, the outer edge of the knuckle<br>
may be generally straight and the pockets, disposed on either side of<br>
the knuckle, may angle towards the flange of the safety member.<br>
In the preferred embodiment and as illustrated in Fig. 4, the<br>
outer edge of the knuckle 53 includes a generally straight section that<br>
is located at a point minimally inside the ends of the score line 80. The<br>
straight section may be inside, but directly adjacent to the area 83<br>
circumscribed by the score line 80. Alternatively, the straight section<br>
may be inside, but directly adjacent to the area transcribed by an arc<br>
85 connecting the ends 84 and 86 of score line 80. The line 85<br>
appears for purposes of illustration in the drawings and does not<br>
actually appear on the disk.<br>
When disk petal 103 bends around the outer edge 53 of hinge<br>
50, the bending portion of the petal will preferably form a generally<br>
straight line between the ends 84 and 86 of score line 80. Thus, a<br>
maximal portion of disk petal 103 will bend out of the fluid passageway.<br>
In this manner, the size of the opening created when the disk ruptures<br>
is maximized.<br><br>
In another embodiment and as illustrated in Figs. 17 and 18,<br>
safety member 50 is generally flat. In certain applications, such as, for<br>
example, electrical switchgear, the space available for the pressure<br>
relief assembly necessitates that the outlet safety head and hinge be<br>
 replaced with a flat plate that can be bolted or otherwise directly<br>
attached to the system. To help prevent a rupture disk from<br>
fragmenting in these situations, a hinge may be defined in the flat plate.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 17, safety member 50 includes a hinge 52.<br>
Hinge 52 includes a tongue 53 that defines a generally straight outer<br>
section and a pocket 190 and 192 on either side of the hinge. In the<br>
illustrated embodiment, hinge 52 lies in the same plane as flange 62.<br>
The present invention contemplates, however, that hinge 52 may be<br>
bent to extend downwardly into the dome of the rupture disk or<br>
upwardly away from the concave side of the disk dome. In addition,<br>
the outer edge of the hinge may have a curved shape.<br>
Preferably, flange 62 includes a series of bolt holes (not shown)<br>
to allow safety member 50 to be directly connected to the pressurized<br>
system. The flange of the rupture disk may be attached to flange 62 of<br>
the rupture disk with an adhesive or through welding.<br>
Pockets 190 and 192 are positioned adjacent first and second<br>
ends 84 and 86 of score line 80 (referring to Fig. 2). It is contemplated<br>
that first and second ends 84 and 86 of score line 80 may terminate at<br>
a point directly below first and second pockets 190 and 192.<br>
Alternatively, first and second ends 84 and 86 of score line may<br>
terminate at a point that is directly below the edge of hinge 53 that<br>
defines first and second pockets 190 and 192.<br>
As described in greater detail above, when the rupture disk<br>
opens, petal 103 of the rupture disk will bend around hinge 52 to<br>
absorb the energy of the disk opening. Hinge 52 may bend with petal<br>
103 as the rupture disk opens to further absorb the energy of the disk<br>
opening. Preferably, safety member 50 also includes stress risers 88<br><br>
that, as also described above, ensure the rupture disk fully opens along<br>
the score line.<br>
The portions of the disk petal surrounding the ends of the score<br>
line will fold into pockets 190 and 192. This will reduce the magnitude<br>
5 of the stresses acting on the ends of the score line to prevent the tear<br>
in the rupture disk from continuing past the ends of the score line and<br>
ultimately causing the disk petal to fragment.<br>
Another factor in obtaining a large and unobstructed opening in<br>
all service conditions is controlling the initial reversal point of the disk.<br>
The initial reversal point of the disk is the point at which the disk initially<br>
buckles under the force of the pressurized fluid. In one preferred<br>
embodiment, the initial reversal point is positioned at the apex of the<br>
dome shaped rupturable portion. This is a central position on the<br>
rupture disk and also the position on the rupturable portion that is the<br>
furthest from the transition area of the disk. Initiating reversal at this<br>
point ensures that the disk reverses in a symmetrical fashion.<br>
A symmetrical disk reversal will result in an enhanced disk<br>
opening for both scored and unscored disks. In a scored disk, the<br>
symmetrical reversal ensures that an equal force is distributed along<br>
the entirety of the score line so that the disk material will tear<br>
completely along the score line and fully open. In an unscored disk,<br>
where a secondary cutting mechanism, such as perimeter teeth, are<br>
used to puncture and open the disk, the symmetrical reversal ensures<br>
that the disk material will fold evenly over the secondary cutting<br>
mechanism. The secondary cutting mechanism will then cause the<br>
disk to fully open and allow the disk petal to bend around the disk hinge<br>
and maximize the size of the opening.<br>
in accordance with the present invention, the dome of the<br>
rupturable portion includes a structural apex formation. A structural<br>
apex formation of the present invention will introduce a structural<br>
weakness, such as, for example, a thinning or stretching of the disk<br>
material, into the rupturable portion of the rupture disk. The thinning or<br><br>
stretching of the disk material compromises the structural integrity of<br>
the disk dome. It has been found that when the disk is subject to a<br>
fluid having a certain pressure, the rupture disk will initiate its reversal<br>
at the structural weakness. Thus, a properly configured structural apex<br>
formation will control the initial reversal point of the disk.<br>
It should also be noted that a structural apex formation will<br>
reduce the expected burst pressure of the rupture disk. In other words,<br>
a disk that has a structural apex formation will burst at a lower pressure<br>
than a similar disk without a structural apex formation. This is<br>
noteworthy in that a disk without a structural apex formation must be<br>
made from a thinner material in order to achieve the same burst<br>
pressure as a disk with a structural apex formation. It has also been<br>
found that a correlation exists between the size and shape of the<br>
structural apex formation and the amount of reduction in the burst<br>
pressure. In general, a larger structural apex formation will result in a<br>
greater reduction in burst pressure.<br>
The concept of the structural apex formation offers the potential<br>
for great improvement in the reliability and accuracy of rupture disks,<br>
particularly those disks configured to rupture at low pressures. The low<br>
pressure disks must typically be made from a thin material, which is<br>
easily damaged. Any damage to the disk prior to or during installation<br>
can dramatically alter the burst pressure of the disk. In addition, any<br>
irregularities in the installation, such as mis-alignment of safety heads<br>
or of the disk itself, heat induced irregularities, and bolt or flange<br>
insensitivity, can further alter the burst pressure of the disk. Since a<br>
disk with a structural apex formation can be made from a thicker<br>
material that is less susceptible to these types of problems, the<br>
introduction of a structural apex formation will improve the reliability of<br>
the rupture disks.<br>
In addition, it has been found that the size and shape of the<br>
structural apex formation will be the determining factor in determining<br>
the burst pressure of the rupture disk. In other words, the configuration<br><br>
of the structural apex formation will override other design factors, such<br>
as, for example, the depth and location of the score line, that previously<br>
affected the burst pressure of the rupture disk.<br>
As shown in Figs. 6 and 7, the structural apex formation is<br>
preferably an indentation 140 located at the apex of the domed shape<br>
of the rupturable portion. Preferably, as shown in Fig. 7, indentation<br>
140 is formed in convex surface 47 of the dome, creating a cavity 143<br>
in the convex surface 47 and a corresponding nipple-shaped<br>
protrusion/dimple 144 in the concave surface 46. Alternatively,<br>
indentation 140 may be formed in the concave surface 46 of the dome,<br>
creating a cavity in the concave surface 46 and a corresponding nipple-<br>
shaped protrusion in the convex surface 47.<br>
As shown in Fig. 7, indentation 140 includes a circular outer<br>
edge 142. Preferably, the distance from the outer edge 142 to<br>
transition area 49 is the same at all points along outer edge 142 of<br>
indentation 140.<br>
As shown in Figs. 8 and 9, the indentation may have a variety of<br>
shapes. For example, as illustrated in Fig. 8, indentation 140 may be a<br>
straight line having a midpoint coinciding with the apex of the dome. In<br>
addition, as shown in Fig. 9, indentation 140 may include two straight<br>
lines that intersect at the apex of the dome.<br>
It is contemplated that changing the size and shape of the<br>
structural apex formation can produce wide variations in the pressure<br>
at which a disk of given size and material will burst. For example, a 1"<br>
disk made of .003" thick material having a small indentation will burst at<br>
a higher pressure than a similar disk with a larger indentation. Thus,<br>
altering the configuration of the structural apex formation allows a<br>
particular size and thickness rupture disk to be adapted to the<br>
particular pressure relief needs of a variety of different commercial<br>
applications.<br>
It should be noted, however, that to produce a rupture disk that<br>
will accurately burst at the desired pressure, the indentation, or other<br><br>
structural apex formation, must be formed in a manner that ensures<br>
that the configuration of the structural apex formation is consistent<br>
between disks. One method of forming an indentation in a rupture disk<br>
is described in U.S. Patent No. 6,006,938 to Mozely. In the method<br>
described therein, the indentation is "free-formed" in that a tool is<br>
impacted with the disk as the disk is being formed, without any<br>
additional support for the rupture disk. As shown in the test data set<br>
forth below, the rupture disks formed according to this method will not<br>
consistently burst at a desired pressure. This method, therefore, will<br>
not produce a disk with the high level of burst pressure accuracy that is<br>
demanded by many commercial applications.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, an apparatus for<br>
forming an indentation in the dome of a rupture disk is provided. It is<br>
contemplated that the indentation may be formed at any stage in the<br>
manufacture of the disk. Accordingly, the present invention is directed<br>
to an apparatus for forming an indentation in a formed rupture disk or a<br>
rupture disk blank and to an apparatus for forming an indentation in a<br>
rupture disk as the dome of thedisk is being formed. The indent<br>
forming apparatuses allow indentations to be formed in rupture disks in<br>
a reliable and consistent manner, which, as set forth in the test data<br>
below, results in an improvement in the burst accuracy of the rupture<br>
disks.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 10, an indent forming apparatus 148<br>
includes a first member, which is preferably an anvil 154. Anvil 154<br>
includes a support surface 155 that defines and opening 164.<br>
Preferably, opening 164 is circular, although it is contemplated that<br>
opening 164 may have other shapes.<br>
Support surface 155 is configured to engage one side of<br>
rupturable portion 45 at the apex of the domed shape such that<br>
opening 164 encompasses the apex. It is contemplated that support<br>
surface 155 may have a small width such that only a selected portion<br>
of rupturable portion 45 is supported. Alternatively, support surface<br><br>
155 may have a shape that conforms to the contour of the rupture disk<br>
dome and extends to the transition area of the disk, such that the entire<br>
rupturabie portion 45, outside of opening 164, is supported.<br>
Preferably, support surface 155 engages the concave side of<br>
the domed shape, although the support surface may engage the<br>
convex side of the domed shape. Alternatively, the anvil may engage<br>
one side of a rupture disk blank that, as described in greater detail<br>
below, will eventually be formed into a rupture disk.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, the centerline 162 of anvil 154 is<br>
aligned with the apex of the domed shape of rupturabie portion 45. It is<br>
contemplated, however, that centerline 162 may be offset from the<br>
apex of the dome shape.<br>
A frame 156 surrounds anvil 154. Frame 156 includes an inner<br>
wall 158 that defines a cavity configured to receive flange 48 of the<br>
rupture disk. Preferably, the height of inner wall 158 is chosen to<br>
ensure that flange 48 does not contact the bottom surface 159 of the<br>
cavity so that anvil 154 is the only source of support for the rupture<br>
disk. In addition, the diameter of inner wall 158 closely corresponds to<br>
the diameter of flange 48. In this manner, inner wall 158 ensures that<br>
the rupture disk is correctly aligned on anvil 154.<br>
Frame 156 may include one or more pins 160 (only one pin<br>
illustrated in Fig. 10). Pins 160 are configured to engage holes 88 in<br>
flange 48 (referring to Fig. 6). The engagement of pins 160 with holes<br>
88 further ensures that the rupture disk is correctly aligned on anvil<br>
154.<br>
The indent forming apparatus 148 also includes a second<br>
member, which is preferably a punch 150 that is generally aligned with<br>
opening 164 in anvil 154. In the illustrated embodiment, the centerline<br>
166 of punch 150 is directly aligned with the centerline 162 of the anvil.<br>
The present invention contemplates, however, that the punch 150 may<br>
be offset with respect to the apex and/or the anvil, provided that the<br>
punch tip is within the area circumscribed by anvil opening 164.<br><br>
Punch 150 includes a tip 152 that engages the second side of<br>
rupturabie portion 45. As punch 150 moves relative to anvil 154, the<br>
material of the rupturabie portion corresponding to opening 164 is<br>
displaced relative to the anvil 154. This forced and controlled<br>
displacement causes the disk material along the edge and downsloping<br>
section of the indentation to deform, by stretching, thinning, or<br>
shearing, relative to the surrounding disk material.<br>
The supporting force of the anvil, which opposes the force of the<br>
punch, will create a permanent deformation, such as a crease 200<br>
(referring to Fig. 19) in the surface of rupturabie portion 45. This<br>
permanent deformation is created as the punch forces a displacement<br>
of the material of the rupturabie portion relative to the material that is<br>
supported by the anvil. Preferably, the concave surface of the disk is<br>
supported by the anvil and, thus, the deformation will be formed in at<br>
least the concave surface. It is contemplated that the deformation may<br>
also be formed in the convex surface or in both the concave and<br>
convex surfaces.<br>
The deformation, stretching, thinning, or shearing of the disk<br>
material creates the structural weakness in the disk dome. By<br>
precisely controlling the movement and location of the punch and anvil,<br>
similar amounts of thinning, stretching, or shearing may be induced in<br>
successive disks. In this manner, the reliability and accuracy of a<br>
series of rupture disks may be maintained at a level required for<br>
commercial application.<br>
Preferably, the motion of punch 150 is precisely controlled. In<br>
the preferred embodiment, the allowable range of motion of punch tip<br>
152 is governed by a micrometer, which allows for adjustments of<br>
0.0001". In this manner, the depth of the indent, with respect to the<br>
apex of the dome, that is created in the rupture disk may be accurately<br>
and precisely controlled.<br>
Alternatively, punch tip 152 and anvil opening 164 may be<br>
closely sized so that the disk material is displaced in shear. As<br><br>
illustrated in Fig. 19, indentation 140 formed by shearing rupturable<br>
portion 45 results in outer edge 142 having a sharp corner. In addition,<br>
a crease 200 is formed on the opposite side of rupturable portion 45,<br>
which in the illustrated embodiment is the concave surface. The<br>
shearing action of the punch also creates a well-defined thinned area<br>
202 in the rupturable portion 45. This thinned area represents the<br>
structural weakness that will coincide with the point of initial reversal.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 11, a punch tip 152 for shearing the material<br>
of rupturable portion 45 preferably includes a concave surface 168.<br>
When punch tip 152 is engaged with rupturable portion 45, edge 167<br>
first engages the curving surface of the rupturable portion. This<br>
ensures that each indentation formed in subsequent rupture disks will<br>
have essentially the same shape. A flat punch tip will wear down with<br>
use and may eventually result in uneven and inconsistent indentations.<br>
The profile of punch tip 152 may have any shape or size. For<br>
example, as illustrated in Figs. 12a-12c, punch tip 152 may have a<br>
circular profile (referring to Fig. 12a), a D-shaped profile (referring to<br>
Fig. 12b), or a tear drop profile (referring to Fig. 12c). The shape of<br>
anvil opening 164 may or may not be configured to correspond to the<br>
profile of punch tip 152. For example, a tear drop shaped punch profile<br>
may be used in conjunction with either a circular anvil opening or a tear<br>
drop shaped anvil opening.<br>
The present invention contemplates that the configuration of<br>
indentation 140 may be varied through any number of variances in the<br>
indent forming apparatus. For example, the size and shape of punch<br>
tip 152 and anvil opening 164 may be varied alone or in combination to<br>
alter the resulting shape of the indentation. In addition, one or both of<br>
punch tip 152 and anvil opening 164 may be offset from the apex of the<br>
dome shape to further vary the configuration of the indentation. It is<br>
expected that continued experimentation with differently shaped and<br>
sized punch tips and anvil openings will result in an indentation<br>
configuration that provides optimal performance characteristics.<br><br>
An apparatus 160 for forming an indentation in the rupturable<br>
portion as the rupture disk is formed is illustrated in Figs. 13 and 14.<br>
As is known in the art, rupture disks are typically manufactured from a<br>
flat, circular sheet of material known as a rupture disk blank. A portion<br>
of the flat sheet of material is subject to a pneumatic or hydraulic<br>
pressure to form the dome-shaped rupturable portion.<br>
Apparatus 160 includes a clamp 161 that securely holds the<br>
perimeter of a disk blank (identified as dashed line 172). Clamp 161<br>
includes a support 162 and a mold 164. Support 162 includes a central<br>
passageway 168 connected to a source of pressurized fluid. When the<br>
disk blank is securely fastened in clamp 161, passageway directs the<br>
pressurized fluid (as indicated by arrows 170) against the central,<br>
undamped portion of the disk blank. The force of the fluid acts on the<br>
undamped material of the disk blank to displace the undamped<br>
material relative to the clamp and into mold 164.<br>
Mold 164 includes a concave surface 176 that faces the disk<br>
blank. As the undamped material is displaced relative to the clamp,<br>
the material engages concave surface 176. The shape of concave<br>
surface 176 defines the resulting shape of rupturable portion 45.<br>
Mold 164 includes an opening 150 that houses a member, which<br>
is preferably a punch 1.50. Punch 150 includes a tip 152 that projects<br>
from concave surface 176 at or near a point that corresponds to the<br>
apex of the domed shape. Preferably, punch 150 is moveable with<br>
respect to mold 164 to vary the distance by which punch tip 152<br>
projects from concave surface 176. Mold 164 also includes a vent 174<br>
to allow the pressurized fluid to escape if any problems occur during<br>
the formation of the rupture disk.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 14, punch tip 152 engages the material of<br>
the disk blank as it is displaced by the pressurized fluid. The continued<br>
force of the fluid on the blank material causes the material to deflect<br>
around the punch tip, resulting in the formation of indentation 140. The<br>
shape of indentation 140 and of indentation edge 142 may be altered<br><br>
by varying the pressure of the forming fluid. A higher fluid pressure will<br>
result in a sharper radius of curvature in indentation edge 142.<br>
Conversely, a lower fluid pressure will result in a greater radius of<br>
curvature in indentation edge.<br>
By forming the rupture disk into the mold and punch<br>
combination, the resulting configuration of the indentation can be<br>
precisely controlled. In particular, the depth of the indentation, with<br>
respect to the apex of the dome, can be precisely controlled. In<br>
addition, the height of the dome with respect to the disk flange, which is<br>
another factor that has a significant impact on the burst pressure of the<br>
disk, can be precisely controlled. Thus, the reliability and accuracy of<br>
the rupture disks can be maintained at a level required for commercial<br>
applications.<br>
The present invention contemplates that punch tip 152 may<br>
have a cross-sectional shape as illustrated in Fig. 11, and any profile,<br>
including, for example, those profiles illustrated in Figs. 12a-12c. It is<br>
further contemplated that the punch tip may be offset from the apex of<br>
the domed shape.<br>
The configuration of indentation 140 may also be varied by<br>
moving the punch tip and reforming the disk dome. After the disk is<br>
formed with a fluid at a first pressure, punch tip 152 may be retracted,<br>
partially or fully, with respect to the concave shape of the mold. The<br>
rupture disk is then subject to pressurized fluid at a second pressure,<br>
which is preferably less than the original forming pressure. The<br>
pressurized fluid will again act on the disk to reform the dome. Since<br>
the punch tip is no longer engaged with the rupturable portion, the fluid<br>
will act to decrease the depth of the indentation relative to the apex of<br>
the domed shape. In this manner, the configuration of the indentation<br>
may be altered.<br>
The present invention further contemplates that a rupture disk<br>
dome having an indentation may be hard stamped from a rupture disk<br>
blank. This would be achieved by tooling that is configured to create<br><br>
the desired shape of the rupture disk dome from the rupture disk blank.<br>
In this embodiment, the punch is slidably disposed in the tooling. This<br>
would allow the depth of the indent, relative to the apex of the dome, to<br>
be changed between disks having similar dome heights and shapes.<br>
As discussed above, the configuration of the indentation determines<br>
the burst pressure of the rupture disk. Thus, the burst pressure of<br>
otherwise similar disks may be easily modified to meet the needs of<br>
different commercial applications.<br>
Alternatively, as illustrated in Figs. 15 and 16, the structural<br>
apex formation may be an opening 180 in rupturable portion 45 of the<br>
rupture disk. As shown in Fig. 15, opening 180 is preferably centered<br>
at the apex of the domed shape of rupturable portion 45. It is<br>
contemplated, however, that opening 180 may be offset from the apex<br>
of the domed shape.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 15, opening 180 is preferably circular. The<br>
present invention contemplates, however, that opening 180 may have<br>
other shapes, such as, for example, a triangle, square, pentagon,<br>
hexagon, or oval.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 16, a liner 182 covers and seals opening<br>
182. Preferably, liner 182 is made of a material that is lighter and more<br>
flexible that the material of the rupture disk. Preferably, liner 182<br>
covers the entire rupture disk, although liner 182 may only extend a<br>
short distance past opening 182. Liner 182 may be attached with an<br>
adhesive material or through welding to any part of the rupture disk,<br>
including the rupturable portion and/or the flange.<br>
It has been found, as evidenced in the examples below, that<br>
indenting the dome of the disk at the apex in accordance with the<br>
methods and apparatus of the present invention improves the burst<br>
accuracy of the rupture disk. Rupture disks are manufactured in lots of<br>
a given number (typically 5-10 pieces) and all disks within a lot<br>
receive a rated rupture pressure based on a statistical sampling of test<br>
disks from the same manufacturing lot. Typically, all of the disks within<br><br>
the lot will rupture within 5% of the rated rupture pressure. Thus, to<br>
prevent premature rupture of the disk, the operating pressure of the<br>
system should not exceed 90% of the rated rupture pressure of the<br>
disk. Increasing the accuracy and repeatability of the disk will allow the<br>
system to be operated at higher than 90% of the rated pressure of the<br>
rupture disk and still achieve an acceptable safety margin.<br>
Rupture disks according to the present invention are<br>
considerably more consistent in their actual rupture pressure. The<br>
following burst accuracy test data represents comparative testing done<br>
on rupture disks having an indentation formed in one of three different<br>
methods: (1) free formed indent, (2) mold formed indent; and (3) anvil<br>
formed indent.<br>
Burst Accuracy Test 1 - Disks with Free Formed Indentation:<br>
This burst accuracy testing was performed on 1.5" disks having<br>
an indentation formed with a "free form" method where a tool was<br>
engaged with the disk dome during formation, without the use of a<br>
mold or other support. Several configurations of disks having various<br>
thicknesses, dome heights, and indent depths were burst to determine<br>
the actual burst pressure of each disk. The actual burst pressures for<br>
each configuration of disk were then compared to determine the burst<br>
accuracy for that disk configuration.<br><br><br>
* Represents three times the standard deviation in actual burst pressures as a<br>
percentage of the average rated burst pressure.<br>
Burst Accuracy Test 2 - Disks with Mold Formed Indentation:<br>
This burst accuracy testing was performed on 1.5" disks having<br>
an indentation formed with a moid as described in greater detail above.<br>
Several configurations of disks having various thicknesses, dome<br>
heights, and indent depths were burst to determine the actual burst<br>
pressure of each disk. The actual burst pressures for each<br>
configuration of disk were then compared to determine the burst<br>
accuracy for that disk configuration.<br><br>
* Represents three times the standard deviation in actual burst pressures as a<br>
percentage of the average rated burst pressure.<br>
Burst Accuracy Test 3 - Disks with Anvil Formed Indentation:<br>
This burst accuracy testing was performed on 1" disks having an<br>
indentation formed with an anvil after formation of the disk dome, as<br>
described in greater detail above. Several configurations of disks<br><br>
having various thicknesses, dome heights, and indent depths were<br>
burst to determine the actual burst pressure of each disk. The actual<br>
burst pressures for each configuration of disk were then compared to<br>
determine the burst accuracy for that disk configuration.<br>

percentage of the average rated burst pressure.<br>
i Burst Accuracy Summary<br>
The following table summarizes the foregoing test data. This<br>
table presents the average of burst accuracies for the different<br>
methods of forming an indentation in the dome of the rupture disk.<br>
" Kepresents an average or tne Durst accuracies as determined in tne above<br>
testing.<br>
As shown in the above testing and summarized in the preceding<br>
table, rupture disks having an indentation formed in accordance with<br>
the present invention have a far greater burst accuracy than disks<br>
having indentations formed with other methods.<br><br>
Adjusting other design parameters of the disk, such as, for<br>
example, the location of the score line, may provide additional<br>
• improvements upon the-burst accuracy of the disk. The present<br>
invention contemplates that a rupture disk having a structural apex<br>
formation consistent with the present invention and a score line in the<br>
transition area of the disk will also have greatly improved burst<br>
accuracy characteristics when compared to the burst accuracy<br>
characteristics of conventional rupture disks.<br>
Another benefit of the present invention is a reduced damage<br>
safety ratio. The damage safety ratio of a disk is determined by<br>
dividing the actual burst pressure of a damaged disk by the rated<br>
pressure of the disk. The following data represents the damage ratio of<br>
rupture disks made according to the present invention with different<br>
types of damage:<br>
Damage Test: The following damage testing was performed on 1"<br>
rupture disks according to the present invention. These rupture disks<br>
were made from 0.004" Ni formed at 275 psig with a resulting 0.190"<br>
crown height. The average burst pressure of the disk batch tested in<br>
an undamaged state was 50.6 psig. According to ASME standards, an<br>
acceptable burst pressure tolerance is ± 5 psig of the rated burst<br>
pressure. Thus, for the rupture disks of this test, the minimum<br>
acceptable burst pressure is 48.1 psig and the maximum acceptable<br>
burst pressure is 53.1 psig.<br><br><br><br>
I	I 	;	1			I	I<br>
* A disk is considered damaged when the dome of the disk is physically altered to<br>
include a feature that is visible on both sides of the rupturable portion of the disk.<br>
** Blunt damage to the disk was inflicted using a generally flat object with a circular<br>
profile, for example a hammer with a diameter of approximately 0.75".<br>
*** Sharp damage to the disk was inflicted using a tool having a rectangular profiled<br>
tip, for example a screw driver with dimensions 0.200" x 0.040".<br>
As shown in the above testing, a rupture disk made in<br>
accordance with the present invention has a damage safety ratio of<br>
less than about 1. Thus, if a rupture disk according to the present<br>
invention is damaged prior to or after installation, the disk will still<br>
rupture at a pressure that is no greater than the maximum acceptable<br>
burst pressure of the disk (which, in this example, is the rated burst<br>
pressure plus 5%).<br>
As mentioned previously, the disclosed pressure relief assembly<br>
may be used in a pressurized system containing either a pressurized<br>
gas or a pressurized liquid. In accordance with the present invention, a<br><br>
rupture disk is provided that, when burst, has a low flow resistance, Kr,<br>
in both a liquid application and a gas application.<br>
The flow resistance, Kr, of a rupture disk determines the rate at<br>
which the rupture disk will relieve fluid to reduce the pressure of a<br>
system. The flow resistance is a function of the pressure drop, or<br>
velocity head loss, over the burst rupture disk. A large velocity head<br>
loss results in a large Kr and, thus, a lower fluid release rate. The<br>
American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), standard ASME<br>
PTC 25, have established performance testing requirements for fluid<br>
relief rates of a rupture disk.<br>
Rupture disks made in accordance with the present invention<br>
have a low Kr in both liquid and gas environments. The Kr rating of a<br>
rupture disk is determined through a standardized procedure. In one<br>
method, the Kr rating of a particular disk design is determined by<br>
bursting three samples of three different sizes of the rupture disk at the<br>
minimum pressure rating for the disk. The Kr value for each of the nine<br>
burst disks is then determined. Next, the average and the standard<br>
deviation of the nine Kr values is determined. The Kr rating for the<br>
rupture disk is equal to the average of the nine Kr values plus three<br>
times the standard deviation of the nine Kr values. The following test<br>
data represents testing done on disks made in accordance with the<br>
present invention in a gas environment according to ASME standards:<br><br><br><br>
As shown in the above testing, a rupture disk according to the<br>
present invention has a low Kr in a gas environment. While the Kr for a<br>
liquid environment may be slightly higher, the present invention<br>
nonetheless provides for a low Kr value under liquid conditions.<br>
Preferably, the Kr of the rupture disk according to the present invention<br>
is less than about 1.6 in both gas and liquid applications. More<br>
preferably, the Kr of the rupture disk according to thepresent invention<br>
is less than about 1.0 in both gas and liquid applications. Even more<br>
preferably, the Kr of the rupture disk according to the present invention<br>
is less than about 0.7 in gas and/or liquid applications.<br>
An additional benefit of the present invention is a rupture disk<br>
design that provides low rupture pressures in a liquid application.<br>
Conventional non-fragmenting rupture disks are unsuited for low<br>
pressure liquid applications since the disks will not open fully in such<br>
an application. The rupture disk of the present invention, however, will<br>
meet ASME performance standards in liquid applications having<br>
operating pressures of under 100 psig.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various<br>
modifications and variations can be made in the rupture disk assembly<br>
of the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the<br>
invention. Other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and<br>
practice of the invention disclosed herein. It is intended that the<br>
specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with a<br>

having a pathway configured to direct a pressurized fluid against the unclamped portion of<br>
the blank, the pressurized fluid acting on the undamped portion to displace the undamped<br>
portion of the blank relative to the clamp ;<br>
a mold having a concave shape configured to receive the unclamped portion of the<br>
blank as the unclamped portion is displaced relative to the clamp and to form the<br>
unclamped portion of the blank into a domed shape generally corresponding to the<br>
concave shape of the mold ; and<br>
a member disposed in the mold and configured to engage the unclamped portion of<br>
the blank as the unclamped portion is displaced relative to the clamp to thereby form an<br>
indentation at or near the apex of the domed shape.<br>
27.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 26, wherein the member is a punch and the<br>
centreline of the punch is aligned with the apex of the domed shape.<br>
28.The apparatus as claimed in claim 27, wherein the member is a punch and the punch<br>
has a circular cross section.<br><br>
29.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 26, wherein the member is a punch and the<br>
punch has a tip having a concave surface.<br>
30.	A method of forming a rupture disk from a blank by the apparatus as claimed in<br>
claim 26, said method comprising the steps of:<br>
clamping the outer perimeter of the blank ;<br>
directing a pressurized fluid against a central portion of the blank to displace the<br>
central portion of the blank relative to the outer perimeter and into a mold having a concave<br>
shape;<br>
forming the central portion of the blank into a domed shape generally corresponding<br>
to the concave shape of the mold ; and<br>
engaging a member with central portion of the blank as the central portion is formed<br>
into the domed shape to form an indentation at or near the apex of the domed shape.<br>
31.	The method as claimed in claim 30 comprising the steps of:<br>
removing the member from the mold ; and<br>
directing a pressurized fluid having a second pressure against the central portion to<br>
reduce the depth of the indentation relative to the apex of the domed shape.<br>
32.	The method as claimed in claim 30 comprising the step of:<br>
controlling the depth of the indentation relative to the apex of the dome by adjusting<br>
the member relative to the mold.<br>
33.	A rupture disk whenever made by the method as claimed in claim 30.<br>
Dated this 20th day of January, 2005.<br><br>
This invention relates to a V belt continuously variable transmission constituted<br>
by coupling a drive pulley 55, which is mounted on a crankshaft (input shaft) 28,<br>
and a driven pulley 56, which is mounted on a transmission shaft (output shaft)<br>
47, with a V belt 57, when a driven side variable pulley half body 56b of the<br>
driven pulley 56 moves to a top time position where a winding diameter is<br>
minimized, a boss portion 63 of the driven side movable pulley half body 56b is<br>
brought into abutment against a spring bearing member 65, whereby the driven<br>
side movable pulley half body 56b is regulated to the top time position.</td>
