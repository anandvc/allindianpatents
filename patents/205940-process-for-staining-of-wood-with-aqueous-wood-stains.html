Process for the staining of wood with aqueous wood stains<br>
The present invention relates to aqueous wood stains and to their use in a process for the staining of wood.<br>
Stained woods, or the dyes applied to the wood often exhibit undesired bleaching or changes in shade as a result of the action of light and/or heat. Furthermore, the stained woods often display a colour unlevelness.<br>
The use of solvent-containing wood stains for the photochemical and thermal stabilization of the (unstained) material wood is known, for example, from EP-A-0 943 665.<br>
EP-A-0 479 075 discloses the treatment of wood with a wood stain comprising a colorant, a solvent and a stabilizer.<br>
There continues to be a need for an improved protection of the stained wood against light and evolution of heat, and for a process which permits even penetration of the wood and uses low-solvent or solvent-free wood stains.<br>
The object of the present invention was therefore to provide a process according to which the stained wood would satisfy today's requirements with regard to penetration, photostability and heat stability.<br>
It has now been found that using the special wood stains described below it is possible to achieve good penetration and very good stabilization of stained wood.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the staining of wood, which comprises treating the unstained wood with an aqueous preparation (stain) comprising<br>
a)	at least one dye and<br>

The dye stabilizer which is very particularly preferably used in the process according to the invention is the compound 1-oxyl-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-hydroxypipeR1dine of the formula<br><br><br>
as compositions for protecting stained woods against the effect of light and heat, where G1f G2,Z1, Z2, E, X, h and j have the meanings and preferred meanings given above.<br>
The dye stabilizers of the formula (I) or (II) are usually used in an amount of from 1 to 10% by weight, preferably 2 to 6% by weight, based on the weight of the wood to be treated.<br>
Dyes which are suitable for use in the process according to the invention for the staining of wood are all customary dyes used in wood staining. In particular, acid dyes, and also cationic dyes, reactive dyes, and metal complex dyes are suitable for use in the process according to the invention.<br>
Acid dyes are, for example, those dyes descR1bed in the Colour Index, 3rd edition (3rd revision 1987 including Additions and Amendments up to No. 85) under "Acid Dyes". The anionic dyes which can be used may belong to a wide vaR1ety of dye classes and may contain one or more sulfonic acid groups. Examples are tR1phenylmethane dyes with at least two sulfonic acid groups, heavy-metal-free monoazo and disazo dyes each with one or more sulfonic acid groups and heavy-metal-containing, namely copper-, chromium-, nickel- or cobalt-containing monoazo, bisazo, azomethine and formazan dyes, in particular metallized dyes which contain two molecules of azo dye or one molecule of azo dye and one molecule of azomethine dye bonded to a metal atom, especially those which contain mono- and/or disazo dyes and/or azomethine dyes as ligands, and a chromium or cobalt ion as central atom, and also anthraquinone dyes, in particular 1-amino-4-arylaminoanthraquinone-2-sulfonic acids and 1,4-diarylamino- or 1-cycloalkylamino-4-arylaminoanthraquinonesulfonic acids.<br>
Examples of cationic dyes are those dyes which are descR1bed in the Colour Index, 3rd edition, (3rd revision 1987 including additions and amendments up to No.85) under "Basic Dyes". The cationic dyes which can be used may belong to a very wide vaR1ety of classes of dye. In particular, the cationic monoazo, anthraquinone and oxazine dyes are used in the process according to the invention.<br>
Metal complex dyes are to be understood as meaning, for example, the metal-containing acid dyes descR1bed above under acid dyes, and also 1:1 or 1:2-metal complex dyes which do not have water-solubilizing groups, in particular do not have sulfo groups. Of the metal complex dyes, particular importance is given to the copper and cobalt complexes of azo, quinone oxime and hydroxyanthraquinone dyes.<br><br>
The reactive dyes are, for example, those dyes descR1bed in the Colour Index, 3rd edition (3rd Revision 1987 including Additions and Amendments up to No.85) under "Reactive Dyes".<br>
Examples of reactive dyes are dyes from the group of the monoazo, disazo, polyazo, metal complex azo, anthraquinone, phthalocyanine, formazan or dioxazine dyes which contain at least one reactive group. These dyes preferably also contain at least one sulfo group.<br>
Reactive groups are understood as meaning radicals which are reactive towards fibres and which are able to react with the hydroxy! groups of cellulose, the amino, carboxyl, hydroxy! and mercapto groups of wool or silk, or with the amino or, where appropR1ate, the carboxyl groups of synthetic polyamides to form chemical covalent bonds. The reactive groups are usually joined to the dye radical directly or via a bR1dging element. Suitable reactive groups are, for example, those which have at least one substituent which can be detached from an aliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic radical, or those in which the radicals have a radical suitable for reaction with the fibre mateR1al, for example a halogenotR1azinyl, halogenopyR1midinyl or vinyl radical.<br>
Of particular preference in the process according to the invention are the dyes of the formulae<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The dyes of the formulae (1) to (53) are known.<br>
Very particular preference is given in the process according to the invention to the dyes of the formulae (1), (2), (3), (8)( (12), (26), (27), (28), (29), (30), (31), (34), (42), (46), (48), (49), (50), (51), (52) and (53).<br>
The present invention further provides an aqueous wood stain compR1sing at least one dye suitable for the staining of wood and at least one dye stabilizer of the formulae (I) or (II)<br><br>
where<br>
for Gi, G2,Z1, Z2, E, X, h and j, and for the dyes used, the meanings and preferred meanings<br>
given above apply.<br>
The wood stain according to the invention can also compR1se further additives, for example UV absorbers, fungicides or insecticides. Examples of UV absorbers are the UV absorbers of the benzotR1azole, 2-hydroxybenzophenone, 2-hydroxy-1,3f5-tR1azine and oxalanilide<br><br>
seR1es. Examples of fungicides are 1-chloronaphthalene and pentachlorophenol. Examples of insecticides are DDT, cypermethR1n, propiconazole and parathion.<br>
Furthermore, the wood stain can compR1se organic solvents, in particular glycols, polyglycols, ketones or glycol ethers, and especially alcohols.<br>
Wood which can be stained and treated with the dye stabilizer used according to the invention is pR1maR1ly to be understood as meaning shaped wooden bodies with extensive surfaces, for example wooden planks, plywood and chipboard, which may be veneered, carved wooden objects, and wooden sections glued, nailed or screwed together to give, for example, furniture, but also wood in finely divided form, for example wood chips or sawdust. Also suitable for the process according to the invention are thin wooden boards which are prepared by continuously shaving tree-trunks and which are joined together, e.g. glued together, only after they have been stained to give thicker boards or workpieces.<br>
The treatment of the wood to be stained can be carR1ed out, for example, by firstly staining the wood with a dye, optionally drying it and then treating it with a dye stabilizer of the formula (I) or (II), or by treating the wood to be stained directly with a wood stain compR1sing a dye and a dye stabilizer of the formula (I) or (II).<br>
The treatment of the stained wood with the dye stabilizer of the formula (I) or (II) can be carR1ed out, for example, by treating the stained and optionally dR1ed wood with an aqueous formulation of the dye stabilizer of the formula (I) or (II), or by incorporating the dye stabilizer of the formula (I) or (II) into a commercially available nitrocellulose lacquer with which the stained and optionally dR1ed wood is then coated.<br>
Depending on the nature and the type of wood, and the contact times of the wood stains compR1sing a dye stabilizer or a dye stabilizer and a dye, the dye can lie directly on the surface of the wood mateR1al or, advantageously, can penetrate deeper inside the wood.<br>
The wood stain according to the invention is applied to the wood using customary methods, for example by immersing the wood in a bath of the wood stain, by paint-brushing, spraying or by knife-coating. The exposure time here can be up to several hours, and the temperature of the wood stain bath can generally be between 20 and about 110°C. When the treatment is complete, the wooden objects are generally dR1ed in the air at room temperature. The treated wood can, however, also be dR1ed at elevated temperatures up to about 100°C, e.g. in a convection drying cabinet.<br><br>
The wood stain according to the invention can be used to treat all customary types of wood, for example pine, spruce, fir, oak, ash, beech, maple, walnut tree, pear tree, teak, mahogany, chestnut, birch tree, larch, hazelnut, lime tree, willow, poplar, elm, Scots pine, plane tree, obeche or aspen.<br>
The examples below serve to illustrate the invention. Unless stated otherwise, the parts are parts by weight and the percentages are percentages by weight. The temperatures are given in degrees Celsius. The relationship between parts by weight and parts by volume is the same as that between grams and cubic centimetres.<br>
Example 1:<br>
A 100 ml bomb of a pressure dyeing apparatus is charged with a liquor consisting of 80 ml of<br>
water (adjusted to a pH between 6.5 and 7.0) and 0.08 g of the dye of the formula<br><br>
To this are added 4.0 g of a 0.8 mm-thick obeche board.<br>
The bomb is sealed and heated to 110°C. After agitation for 4 hours at this temperature, the<br>
contents of the bomb are cooled, and the stained piece of wood is washed in cold water and<br>
dR1ed.<br><br>
is applied to the stained and dR1ed piece of wood using a knife-coater (groove depth 24 microns) and dR1ed.<br>
This gives an even red coloration with complete penetration in the cross section and a very good light-fastness.<br><br>

93 parts by weight of water,<br>
4 parts by weight of the dye stabilizer of the formula (llld) dissolved in the water<br><br>
is applied to the wood surface prepared in this way in an amount of about 100 g/m2.<br>
The stained wood is then dR1ed in the air.<br>

which<br>
4	parts by weight of the dye stabilizer of the formula<br><br>
has been incorporated into 96 parts by weight of the lacquer. The wood is then dR1ed in the<br>
air.<br>
This gives a bR1lliant red-coloured wood with a very good light-fastness.<br>

Process for the staining of wood with aqueous wood stains<br>
The present invention relates to aqueous wood stains and to their use in a process for the staining of wood.<br>
Stained woods, or the dyes applied to the wood often exhibit undesired bleaching or changes in shade as a result of the action of light and/or heat. Furthermore, the stained woods often display a colour unlevelness.<br>
The use of solvent-containing wood stains for the photochemical and thermal stabilization of the (unstained) material wood is known, for example, from EP-A-0 943 665.<br>
EP-A-0 479 075 discloses the treatment of wood with a wood stain comprising a colorant, a solvent and a stabilizer.<br>
There continues to be a need for an improved protection of the stained wood against light and evolution of heat, and for a process which permits even penetration of the wood and uses low-solvent or solvent-free wood stains.<br>
The object of the present invention was therefore to provide a process according to which the stained wood would satisfy today's requirements with regard to penetration, photostability and heat stability.<br>
It has now been found that using the special wood stains described below it is possible to achieve good penetration and very good stabilization of stained wood.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the staining of wood, which comprises treating the unstained wood with an aqueous preparation (stain) comprising<br>
a)	at least one dye and<br>
b)	at least one dye stabilizer of the formulae (I) or (II)<br><br><br>
in which<br>
G1 and G2 independently of one another, are C1-C4alkyl or together are pentamethylene,<br>
Z1 and Z2 are methyl, orZ1 and Z2 form a bridG1ng member which is unsubstituted or<br>
substituted by an ester, ether, hydroxy!, oxo, cyanohydrin, amido, amino, carboxyl or<br>
urethane radical,<br>
E is oxyl or hydroxyl, and<br>
X is an inorganic or organic anion, and<br>
the total number of cations h corresponds to the total number of anions j.<br>
Preference is G1ven to dye stabilizers of the formulae (I) and (II) in which Z^ and Z2 are methyl or a bridG1ng member containing 1-200 carbon atoms and 0-60 oxygen and/or nitrogen atoms.<br>
X is, for example, phosphate, carbonate, bicarbonate, nitrate, chloride, bromide, bisulfite, sulfite, bisulfate, sulfate, borate, carboxylate, alkylsulfonate, arylsulfonate or phosphonate, for example diethylenetriaminepentamethylenephosphonate.<br>
X as carboxylate is, in particular, a formate, acetate, benzoate, citrate, oxalate, tartrate, acrylate, polyacrylate, fumarate, maleate, itaconate, glycolate, gluconate, malate, mandalate, tiglate, ascorbate, polymethacrylate, nitrilotriacetate, hydroxyethylethylenediaminetriacetate, ethylenediaminetetraacetate or diethylenetriaminepentaacetate.<br>

as compositions for protecting stained woods against the effect of light and heat, where G1f G2,Z1, Z2, E, X, h and j have the meanings and preferred meanings given above.<br>
The dye stabilizers of the formula (I) or (II) are usually used in an amount of from 1 to 10% by weight, preferably 2 to 6% by weight, based on the weight of the wood to be treated.<br>
Dyes which are suitable for use in the process according to the invention for the staining of wood are all customary dyes used in wood staining. In particular, acid dyes, and also cationic dyes, reactive dyes, and metal complex dyes are suitable for use in the process according to the invention.<br>
Acid dyes are, for example, those dyes descR1bed in the Colour Index, 3rd edition (3rd revision 1987 including Additions and Amendments up to No. 85) under "Acid Dyes". The anionic dyes which can be used may belong to a wide vaR1ety of dye classes and may contain one or more sulfonic acid groups. Examples are tR1phenylmethane dyes with at least two sulfonic acid groups, heavy-metal-free monoazo and disazo dyes each with one or more sulfonic acid groups and heavy-metal-containing, namely copper-, chromium-, nickel- or cobalt-containing monoazo, bisazo, azomethine and formazan dyes, in particular metallized dyes which contain two molecules of azo dye or one molecule of azo dye and one molecule of azomethine dye bonded to a metal atom, especially those which contain mono- and/or disazo dyes and/or azomethine dyes as ligands, and a chromium or cobalt ion as central atom, and also anthraquinone dyes, in particular 1-amino-4-arylaminoanthraquinone-2-sulfonic acids and 1,4-diarylamino- or 1-cycloalkylamino-4-arylaminoanthraquinonesulfonic acids.<br>
Examples of cationic dyes are those dyes which are descR1bed in the Colour Index, 3rd edition, (3rd revision 1987 including additions and amendments up to No.85) under "Basic Dyes". The cationic dyes which can be used may belong to a very wide vaR1ety of classes of dye. In particular, the cationic monoazo, anthraquinone and oxazine dyes are used in the process according to the invention.<br>
Metal complex dyes are to be understood as meaning, for example, the metal-containing acid dyes descR1bed above under acid dyes, and also 1:1 or 1:2-metal complex dyes which do not have water-solubilizing groups, in particular do not have sulfo groups. Of the metal complex dyes, particular importance is given to the copper and cobalt complexes of azo, quinone oxime and hydroxyanthraquinone dyes.<br><br>
The reactive dyes are, for example, those dyes descR1bed in the Colour Index, 3rd edition (3rd Revision 1987 including Additions and Amendments up to No.85) under "Reactive Dyes".<br>
Examples of reactive dyes are dyes from the group of the monoazo, disazo, polyazo, metal complex azo, anthraquinone, phthalocyanine, formazan or dioxazine dyes which contain at least one reactive group. These dyes preferably also contain at least one sulfo group.<br>
Reactive groups are understood as meaning radicals which are reactive towards fibres and which are able to react with the hydroxy! groups of cellulose, the amino, carboxyl, hydroxy! and mercapto groups of wool or silk, or with the amino or, where appropR1ate, the carboxyl groups of synthetic polyamides to form chemical covalent bonds. The reactive groups are usually joined to the dye radical directly or via a bR1dging element. Suitable reactive groups are, for example, those which have at least one substituent which can be detached from an aliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic radical, or those in which the radicals have a radical suitable for reaction with the fibre mateR1al, for example a halogenotR1azinyl, halogenopyR1midinyl or vinyl radical.<br>
Of particular preference in the process according to the invention are the dyes of the formulae<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The dyes of the formulae (1) to (53) are known.<br>
Very particular preference is given in the process according to the invention to the dyes of the formulae (1), (2), (3), (8)( (12), (26), (27), (28), (29), (30), (31), (34), (42), (46), (48), (49), (50), (51), (52) and (53).<br>
The present invention further provides an aqueous wood stain compR1sing at least one dye suitable for the staining of wood and at least one dye stabilizer of the formulae (I) or (II)<br><br>
where<br>
for Gi, G2,Z1, Z2, E, X, h and j, and for the dyes used, the meanings and preferred meanings<br>
given above apply.<br>
The wood stain according to the invention can also compR1se further additives, for example UV absorbers, fungicides or insecticides. Examples of UV absorbers are the UV absorbers of the benzotR1azole, 2-hydroxybenzophenone, 2-hydroxy-1,3f5-tR1azine and oxalanilide<br><br>
seR1es. Examples of fungicides are 1-chloronaphthalene and pentachlorophenol. Examples of insecticides are DDT, cypermethR1n, propiconazole and parathion.<br>
Furthermore, the wood stain can compR1se organic solvents, in particular glycols, polyglycols, ketones or glycol ethers, and especially alcohols.<br>
Wood which can be stained and treated with the dye stabilizer used according to the invention is pR1maR1ly to be understood as meaning shaped wooden bodies with extensive surfaces, for example wooden planks, plywood and chipboard, which may be veneered, carved wooden objects, and wooden sections glued, nailed or screwed together to give, for example, furniture, but also wood in finely divided form, for example wood chips or sawdust. Also suitable for the process according to the invention are thin wooden boards which are prepared by continuously shaving tree-trunks and which are joined together, e.g. glued together, only after they have been stained to give thicker boards or workpieces.<br>
The treatment of the wood to be stained can be carR1ed out, for example, by firstly staining the wood with a dye, optionally drying it and then treating it with a dye stabilizer of the formula (I) or (II), or by treating the wood to be stained directly with a wood stain compR1sing a dye and a dye stabilizer of the formula (I) or (II).<br>
The treatment of the stained wood with the dye stabilizer of the formula (I) or (II) can be carR1ed out, for example, by treating the stained and optionally dR1ed wood with an aqueous formulation of the dye stabilizer of the formula (I) or (II), or by incorporating the dye stabilizer of the formula (I) or (II) into a commercially available nitrocellulose lacquer with which the stained and optionally dR1ed wood is then coated.<br>
Depending on the nature and the type of wood, and the contact times of the wood stains compR1sing a dye stabilizer or a dye stabilizer and a dye, the dye can lie directly on the surface of the wood mateR1al or, advantageously, can penetrate deeper inside the wood.<br>
The wood stain according to the invention is applied to the wood using customary methods, for example by immersing the wood in a bath of the wood stain, by paint-brushing, spraying or by knife-coating. The exposure time here can be up to several hours, and the temperature of the wood stain bath can generally be between 20 and about 110°C. When the treatment is complete, the wooden objects are generally dR1ed in the air at room temperature. The treated wood can, however, also be dR1ed at elevated temperatures up to about 100°C, e.g. in a convection drying cabinet.<br><br>
The wood stain according to the invention can be used to treat all customary types of wood, for example pine, spruce, fir, oak, ash, beech, maple, walnut tree, pear tree, teak, mahogany, chestnut, birch tree, larch, hazelnut, lime tree, willow, poplar, elm, Scots pine, plane tree, obeche or aspen.<br>
The examples below serve to illustrate the invention. Unless stated otherwise, the parts are parts by weight and the percentages are percentages by weight. The temperatures are given in degrees Celsius. The relationship between parts by weight and parts by volume is the same as that between grams and cubic centimetres.<br>
Example 1:<br>
A 100 ml bomb of a pressure dyeing apparatus is charged with a liquor consisting of 80 ml of<br>
water (adjusted to a pH between 6.5 and 7.0) and 0.08 g of the dye of the formula<br><br>
To this are added 4.0 g of a 0.8 mm-thick obeche board.<br>
The bomb is sealed and heated to 110°C. After agitation for 4 hours at this temperature, the<br>
contents of the bomb are cooled, and the stained piece of wood is washed in cold water and<br>
dR1ed.<br><br>
is applied to the stained and dR1ed piece of wood using a knife-coater (groove depth 24 microns) and dR1ed.<br>
This gives an even red coloration with complete penetration in the cross section and a very good light-fastness.<br><br>
Example 2:<br>
A 0.8 mm wooden board made of ash is sanded on the upper side using fine sandpaper,<br>
moistened with a cloth, dR1ed and again very carefully sanded. All of the wood dust is then<br>
brushed off the surface.<br>
Using a paintbrush or a hand coater, a stain consisting of<br>
93 parts by weight of water,<br>
4 parts by weight of the dye stabilizer of the formula (llld) dissolved in the water<br><br>
is applied to the wood surface prepared in this way in an amount of about 100 g/m2.<br>
The stained wood is then dR1ed in the air.<br>
This gives a bR1lliant red-coloured wood with a very good light-fastness.<br>
(The ready-stained wood can then be coated with a commercially available nitrocellulose<br>
lacquer.)<br>
Example 3:<br>
A 0.8 mm wooden board made of ash is sanded on the upper side using fine sandpaper,<br>
moistened with a cloth, dR1ed and again very carefully sanded. All of the wood dust is then<br>
brushed off the surface.<br>
Using a paint brush or hand coater, a dye preparation consisting of<br>
97 parts by weight of water and<br>
3	parts by weight of a 20% commercial form of the dye of the formula (45)<br>
Is applied to the wood surface prepared in this way in an amount of about 100 g/m2 and<br>
dR1ed.<br>
The stained wood is then treated with a mordant consisting of<br>
96 parts by weight of water and<br>
4	parts by weight of the dye stabilizer of the formula (llld).<br>
The wood is then dR1ed in the air.<br><br>
This gives a bR1lliant red-coloured wood with a very good light-fastness.<br>
(The ready-stained wood can then be coated with a commercially available nitrocellulose<br>
lacquer.)<br>
Example 4:<br>
A 0.8 mm wood board made of ash is sanded on the upper side using fine sandpaper,<br>
moistened with a cloth, dR1ed and again sanded very carefully. All of the wood dust is then<br>
brushed off the surface.<br>
Using a paint brush or hand coater, a dye preparation consisting of<br>
97 parts by weight of water and<br>
3	parts by weight of a 20% commercial form of the dye of the formula (45)<br>
is applied to the wood surface prepared in this way in an amount of about 100 g/m2 and<br>
dR1ed.<br>
The stained wood is then coated with a commercially available nitrocellulose lacquer in<br>
which<br>
4	parts by weight of the dye stabilizer of the formula<br><br>
has been incorporated into 96 parts by weight of the lacquer. The wood is then dR1ed in the<br>
air.<br>
This gives a bR1lliant red-coloured wood with a very good light-fastness.<br>
Example 5:<br>
The procedure is as stated in Examples 2 to 4, but using, instead of the dye of the formula<br>
(45), the same amount of the dye of the formula<br><br><br>
This gives a blue-coloured wood with a very good light-fastness.<br>
Example 6:<br>
A 0.8 mm wooden board made of ash is sanded on the upper side using fine sandpaper,<br>
moistened with a cloth, dR1ed and sanded again very carefully. All of the wood dust is then<br>
brushed off the surface.<br>
Using a paint brush or hand coater, a stain consisting of<br>
96 parts by weight of water,<br>
3 parts by weight of the dye stabilizer of the formula (Hid) dissolved in the water<br>
is applied to the wood surface prepared in this way in an amount of about 100 g/m2.<br>
The stained wood is dR1ed in the air.<br>
This gives a yellow-coloured wood with a very good light-fastness.<br>
