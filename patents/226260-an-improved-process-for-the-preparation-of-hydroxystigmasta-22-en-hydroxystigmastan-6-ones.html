				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of hydroxystigmasta-22-en/ hydroxystigmastan 6-ones of formula (2).<br>
This invention particularly relates to an improved process for the preparation of (2α, 3α)-2, 3-dihydroxystigmasta-22-en-6-one of formula (2a) and (2a, 3a, 22S, 23S )-2, 3, 22, 23-tetrahydroxystigmastan-6-one of formula (2b).<br>
(Formula Removed) <br><br><br>
FORMULA-2<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
FORMULA-2a<br><br>
FORMULA-lb<br><br>
More particularly it relates to the cis-hydroxylation of stigmasta-2, 22-dien-6-one of formula (1) using RuO4 to give dihydroxy compound of formula (2), where R is nil and dotted line indicates the double bond at C22 - C23 and tetrahydroxy compound of formula (2), where R is OH and C22 - C23 is single bond.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
FORMULA-1<br>
The compound of formula (2) serves as an important intermediate for the synthesis of (22S, 23S)-homobrassinolide (3).<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
 (22S, 23S)-Homobrassinolide of formula (3) is one of the analogues of a new class of highly potent plant growth hormone. It is active in ppm level and increases the yields of variety of agricultural crops. It may be used to increase the total food grain supply of the world.<br>
The hitherto known processes for the cis dihydroxylation of stigmasta-2, 22-dien-6-one are:<br>
(a) Oxidation of the 2, 3 double bond in ring A to get the compound (2a) using catalytic amount of OsO4 and excess N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide in aqueous acetone (Ref. :<br>
K. Mori, M. Sakakibara, Y. Ichikawa, H. Ueda, K. Okada, T. Umemura, G. Yabuta, S. Kuwahara and M. Kondo, Tetrahedron 1982,38, 2099-2109).<br>
(b) Oxidation   of   stigmasta-2,   22-dien-6-one   using   tetradecyltrimethylammonium<br>
permanganate (TDTAP) in the presence of benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide to<br>
get compound (2a) (Ref. : B. G. Hazra, T. Pavankumar and P. L. Joshi, Liebigs<br>
Annalen 1997, 1029-1034).<br>
The method (a) uses OsO4 for hydroxylation which is very costly and highly toxic. The<br>
method (b) uses TDTAP for hydroxylation of double bond in ring A only in which lot of<br>
starting material remains unreacted. Both these methods take long time for the reaction to<br>
complete.<br>
The hitherto known processes for the tetrahydroxylation of stigmasta-2, 22-dien-6-<br>
one are:<br>
(a)	Single step oxidation of stigmasta-2, 22-dien-6-one using two molar equivalents of<br>
OsO4 in benzene and catalytic amount of pyridine for 90 hr (Ref.: M. J. Thompson,<br>
W. J. Meudt, N. B. Mandava, S.   R. Dutky, W. R. Lusby and D. W. Spaulding,<br>
Steroids 1982,39, 89-105).<br>
(b)	Oxidation of the 2, 3 double bond in ring A using catalytic amount of OsO4 and<br>
excess   N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide   in   aqueous   acetone   followed   by   further<br>
oxidation of the 22, 23-double bond in the side chain using equivalent amount of<br>
OsO4 in pyridine for 24 hr to get tetrol of formula (2b) (Ref. : K. Mori, M.<br>
Sakakibara, Y. Ichikawa, H. Ueda, K. Okada, T. Umemura, G. Yabuta, S. Kuwahara<br>
and M. Kondo, Tetrahedron 1982,38, 2099-2109).<br>
(c) Single step oxidation of stigmasta-2, 22-dien-6-one by lengthening the reaction time<br>
for 4 days using catalytic amount of OsO4 and excess N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide<br>
in aqueous THF (Ref. : K. Mori, M. Sakakibara, Y. Ichikawa, H. Ueda, K. Okada, T.<br>
Umemura, G. Yabuta, S. Kuwahara and M. Kondo, Tetrahedron 1982, 38, 2099-<br>
2109).<br>
Method (a) uses two molar equivalents of OsO4 and method (b) uses one molar equivalent of OsO4 for hydroxylation of 22, 23-double bond. Method (b) involves two steps for the formation of tetraol of formula (2b). All the three methods (a), (b) and (c) use OsO4 for hydroxylation which is very costly and highly toxic. All these methods take long time (1 to 4 days) for the reaction to complete.<br>
In the process of the present invention the cis-hydroxylation of stigmasta-2, 22-dien-6-one of formula (1) using the reagent RuO4 is new and has not been reported. Stigmasta-2, 22-dien-6-one of formula (1) may be prepared from naturally occurring stigmasterol in four steps namely tosylation of stigmasterol, solvolysis of the tqsylate, oxidation of the 6ß-hydroxy obtained using Jones' reagent, acid catalysed rearrangement of the 6-keto group to afford compound (1) (Ref. : K. Mori, M. Sakakibara, Y. Ichikawa, H. Ueda, K. Okada, T. Umemura, G. Yabuta, S. Kuwahara and M. Kondo, Tetrahedron 1982, 38, 2099-2109).<br>
