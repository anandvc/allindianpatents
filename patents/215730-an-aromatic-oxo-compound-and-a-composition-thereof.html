				<td>The present invention relates to an aromatic oxo-compound and a composition thereof.<br>
"   This invention relates to prcstaglandln agonists, pharmaceutical compositions containing such agonists and the use of such agonists to prevent bone loss or restore or augment bone mass and to enhance bone healing including the treatment of conditions which present with low bone mass and/or bone defects in vertebrates, and particularly mammals, including humans.<br>
Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease, characterized by low bone mass and deterioration of bone tissue, with a consequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture. In the U.S., the condition affects more than 25 million people and causes more than 1.3 million fractures each year, including 500,000 spine, 250,000 hip and 240,000 wrist fractures annually. Hip fractures are the most serious consequence of osteoporosis, with 5-20% of patients dying within one year, and over 50% of survivors being incapacitated.<br>
The elderly are at greatest risk of osteoporosis, and the problem is therefore predicted to increase significantly with the aging of the population. Worldwide fracture incidence is forecasted to increase three-fold over the next 60 years and-one-study has estimated that there will be -4.5 mollion hip fractures worldwide in 2050.<br>
Women are at greater risk of osteoporosis than men. Women experience a sharp acceleration of bone loss during the five years following menopause. Other factors that increase the risk include smoking, alcohol abuse, a sedentary lifestyle and low calcium intake.<br>
There are currently two main types of pharmaceutical therapy for the treatment of osteoporosis. The first is the use of anti-resorptive compounds to reduce the resorption of bone tissue.<br>
Estrogen is an example of an anti-resorptive agent. It is known that estrogen reduces fractures. In addition, Black, et al. in EP 0605193A1 report that estrogen, particularly when taken orally, lowers plasma levels of LDL and raises those of the beneficial high density lipoproteins (HDL's). However, estrogen failed to restore bone back to young adult levels in the established osteoporotic skeleton. Furthermore, long-term estrogen therapy, has been implicated in a variety of disorders, including an increase in the risk of uterine cancer, endometrial cancer<br>
and possibly breast cancer, causing many women to avoid this treatment. The significant undesirable effects associated with estrogen therapy support the need to develop alternative therapies for osteoporosis that have the desirable effect on serum LDL but do not cause undesirable effects.<br>
A second type of pharmaceutical therapy for the treatment of osteoporosis \ is the use of anabolic agents to promote bone formation and increase bone mass. \ This class of agents is expected to restore bone to the established osteoporotic | skeleton.<br>
U.S. pat. no. 4,112,236 discloses certain interphenylene 8-aza-9-dioxothia-11,12-secoprostaglandins for the treatment of patients with renal impairment.<br>
Certain prostagladin agonists are disclosed in GB 1478281, GB1479156 and U.S. pat. nos. 4,175,203, 4,055,596, 4,175,203, 3,987,091 and 3,991-,106 as being useful as, for example, renal vasodilators.<br>
U.S. pat. no. 4,033,996 discloses certain 8-aza-9-oxo(and dioxo)-thia-11,12-secoprostaglandins which are useful as renal vasodilators, for the prevention of thrombus formation, to induce growth hormone release, and as regulators of the immune response.<br>

U.S. pat. no. 4,386,031 discloses certain N-benzoyho-anilinoalkanecarboxylic acids as antiallergic agents, thrombotic aggregation inhibitors, antiinflammatory agents and lipid-lowering agents.<br>
In addition to osteoporosis, approximately, 20-25 million women and an increasing number of men have detectable vertebral fractures as a consequence of reduced bone mass, with an additional 250,000 hip fractures reported yearly in America alone. The latter case is associated with a 12% mortality rate within the first two years and with a 30% rate of patients requiring nursing home care after the fracture. While this is already significant, the economic and medical consequences of convalescence due to slow or imperfect healing of these bone fractures is expected to increase, due to the aging of the general population.<br>
Estrogens have been shown (Bolander et al., 38th Annual Meeting Orthopedic Research Society, 1992) to improve the quality of the healing of appendicular fractures. Therefore, estrogen replacement therapy might appear to be a method for the treatment of fracture repair. However, patient compliance with estrogen therapy is relatively poor due to its side effects, including the resumption of menses, mastodynia, an increased risk of uterine cancer, an increased perceived risk of breast cancer, and the concomitant use of progestins. In addition, men are likely to object to the use of estrogen treatment. The need exists for a therapy which would be beneficial to patients who have suffered debilitating bone fractures and which would increase patient compliance.<br>
Although there are a variety of osteoporosis therapies, there is a continuing need and a continuing search in this field of art for alternative osteoporosis therapies. In addition, there is a need for bone fracture healing therapies. Also, there is a need for therapy which can promote bone re-growth into skeletal areas where defects exist such as defects caused or produced by, for example, tumors in bone. Further, there is a need for therapy which can promote bone re-growth into skeletal areas where bone grafts are indicated.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In general the compounds of this invention can be made by processes which include processes known in the chemical arts, particularly in light of the description contained herein. Certain processes for the manufacture of the compounds of this invention are provided as further features of the invention and are illustrated by the following reaction schemes. Other processes are described in the experimental section.<br>

Compounds of Formula I wherein B is nitrogen may be prepared using methods described in SCHEMES 1-5. These methods include (a) sequential alkylation of a sulfonamide or amide with two appropriate alkylating agents, generally alkyl halides or alkyl sulfonates; (b) alkylation of a sulfonamide or amide with an alkyl halide or alkyl sulfonate; or (c) reductive amination of an aldehyde followed by reaction with an acylating agent such as an acyl chloride, a chloroformate, an isocyanate or a chlorocarbonyl amide; or a sulfonylating agent such as a sulfonyl chloride. When performing sequential alkylation, one of the alkylating agents will contain a Q-Z portion, where the Z portion is suitably protected if necessary, and the other alkylating agent will contain a K-M portion, where any functional groups requiring protection are suitably protected. The order of the alkylation, i.e., whether the alkylating agent containing the Q-Z portion is added first or second, will depend upon the reactivity of the electrophilic side chain. When performing a reductive amination, the Q-Z portion may be attached to either the amine reagent or the aldehyde reagent depending upon the ease of preparation of the reagent and the reactivity of the reagents in the reductive amination reaction. The reductive amination is followed by acylation or sulfonylation with an appropriate acylating agent or sulfonyl chloride and, if desired the product is hydrolysed. The starting materials, including amines, aldehydes and alkylating agents, are prepared using methods well known to those skilled in the art. Certain preferred methods for their preparation are described herein.<br>
For example, compounds of Formula I wherein B is N are prepared of the methods set forth in SCHEMES 1 and 2 below. In general, the sequences involve sequential alkylation of an appropriate sulfonamide of Formula 1 or amide of Formula 1 with two appropriate alkyl halides or alkyl sulfonates. SCHEMES 1 and 2 differ only in the order of addition of the two alkylating agents. The alkylation order is typically chosen depending on the reactivity of the electrophilic side-chain. It is generally preferable to react the less reactive electrophilic side chain first. This reduces the amount of dialkylation which occurs in that first alkylation step, thereby resulting in a greater yield of monoalkylated material to be carried on to the next alkylation. In SCHEMES 1 and 2, one of the alkylating agents contains a carboxylic aC1d or a carboxylic aC1d isostere, suitably protected with an appropriate protecting group, if necessary. Further, in SCHEMES 1 and 2, the carboxylic aC1d precursor of Formula 3 is a carboxylic aC1d ester where R is a suitable carboxylic aC1d protecting group. Generally, the protecting group is either a straight chain lower alkyl, preferably methyl or ethyl, or a te/f-butyl or phenyl group. Other aC1d isosteres can be employed by appropriately modifying SCHEMES 1 and 2 of methods well known to those skilled in the art (e.g., see SCHEME 6 which sets forth the preparation of a tetrazole). Typical alkylating agents are primary, secondary, benzylic or allylic halides and sulfonates and are preferably alkyl bromides or alkyl iodides.<br>
The Formula 1 sulfonamide or amide is converted to its anion with a strong base such as sodium hydride, lithium diisopropylamide, lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, potassium tert-butoxide, etc. in an aprotic solvent such as dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran or N,N-dimethylformamide/benzene at a temperature of about -78°C to about 100°C. The resulting anion is alkylated with an appropriate alkyl halide of Formula 2 or 3 or an appropriate alkyl sulfonate of Formula 2 or 3, wherein X' is the halide or sulfonate portion of the alkylating agent, at a temperature of about 0°C to about 100°C to yield the corresponding mono-alkylated compound of Formula 4 or 5. In some cases, varying amounts of a side-product resulting from dialkylation of the amide or sulfonamide are obtained and can be removed using chromatographic techniques, preferably by flash chromatography (W.C. Still, M. Kahn, A. Mitra, J. Org. Chem. 43, 2923, 1978). After the first alkylation is complete, the compound<br>
of Formula 4 or 5 is converted to an anion using a suitable base such as sodium hydride, lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, lithium diisopropylamide, potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, potassium tert-butoxide, or potassium carbonate in an aprotic solvent such as N.N-dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, N,N- dimethylformamide/benzene, or acetone at a temperature of about -78°C to about 100°C. Alkylation of the anion with an appropriate second alkyl halide of OFormula 3 or 2 or alkyl sulfonate of Formula 3 or 2 provides the corresponding dialkylated compound of Formula 6. When R is methyl or ethyl, the ester of Formula 6 is hydrolyzed to the corresponding carboxylic aC1d of Formula I with a dilute aqueous basic solution. This hydrolysis is preferably carried out using sodium or potassium hydroxide in aqueous methanol or ethanol, lithium hydroxide in aqueous alcoholic solvent or aqueous tetrahydrofuran at a temperature of about 0°C to about 80°C. Alternatively, the hydrolysis may be carried out by using methods well known to those skilled in the art, for example, methods described in "Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis," Second Edition, T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1991.<br>
SCHEME 1(Scheme Removed)<br>
SCHEME2(Scheme Removed)<br><br>
Compounds of Formula I wherein B is N are also prepared from amines as set forth in SCHEMES 3-4. Generally, the appropriate amine starting materials of Formulas 9 and 10 are commerC1ally obtained or can be prepared using methods well known to those skilled in the art (see "The Chemistry of Amino, Nitroso and Nitro Compounds and their Derivatives," Ed. S. Patai, J. Wiley, New York, 1982). For example, the amine starting materials are prepared from the corresponding nitriles of Formulas 7 or 8. Said nitriles are available from commerC1al sources or can be prepared using methods well known to those skilled in the art (see Rappaport, "The Chemistry of the Cyano Group," IntersC1ence, New York, 1970 or Patai and Rappaport, "The Chemistry of Functional Groups," pt. 2, Wiley, New York, 1983). The nitrite of Formula 7 or 8 is reduced with a reduC1ng agent such as borane-tetrahydrofuran complex, borane-methyl sulfide complex or lithium aluminum hydride in an aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether at a temperature of about -78°C to about 60°C. Alternatively, the nitrile is hydrogenated under a hydrogen atmosphere typically at 0 to 50 psi in the presence of Raney nickel or a platinum or palladium catalyst in a protic solvent such as methanol or ethanol at a temperature of about 0°C to about 50°C. It may be desired to add an equivalent of an aC1d, such as hydrogen chloride, to accomplish the reduction. The amine of Formula 9 or 10 thus obtained is converted to the sulfonamide of Formula 11 or 12 by sulfonylation with a sulfonyl chloride or said amine is converted to an amide of Formula 11 or 12 by acylation with an appropriate acyl chloride. Both the sulfonylation reactions and the<br>
acylation reactions are generally carried out in the presence of a weak base such as triethylamine, pyridine, or 4-methylmorpholine in an aprotic solvent such as methylene chloride or diethyl ether at a temperature of about -20°C to about 50°C. Alternatively, coupling of amines of Formulas 9 or 10 with carboxylic aC1ds are conveniently carried out in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane or N,N-dimethylformamide by a coupling reagent such as 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl )-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) or 1, 3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) in the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (HOBT) to generate compounds of Formulas 11 or 12. Where the amine is present as the hydrochloride or other salt, it is preferable to add one equivalent of a suitable base such as triethylamine to the reaction mixture. Alternatively, the coupling can be effected with a coupling reagent such as benzotriazol-1-yloxy-tris(dimethylamino)-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP) in an inert solvent such as methanol. Such coupling reactions are generally conducted at temperatures of about -30°C to about 80°C, preferably 0°C to about 25°C. For a discussion of other conditions used for coupling peptides see Houben-Weyl, Vol. XV, part II, E. Wunsch, Ed., George Theime Verlag, 1974, Stuttgart. Alkylation and if desired, deprotection, of the Formula 11 or 12 compound as described in SCHEMES 1 and 2 affords the corresponding aC1d Formula 13 and 14 compound. The compounds of Formulas 11 and 12 are alkylated in a manner analogous to the alkylation of the compounds of Formulas 1, 4 and 5 of SCHEMES 1 and 2 hereinabove. The alkylated products are deprotected, if necessary, to afford the compounds of Formulas 13 and 14.<br>
The amines of Formulas 9 and 10 are also prepared via reduction of an appropriate amide of Formulas 15 and 16. This reduction is achieved using reagents such as a borane-tetrahydrofuran complex, a borane-methyl sulfide complex, or diisobutyaluminum hydride in an aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether at a temperature of about -78°C to about 60°C.<br>
The amines of Formulas 9 and 10 are also obtained from the corresponding nitro precursors by reduction of the nitro group using reduC1ng reagents such as zinc/HC1, hydrogenation in the presence of Raney nickel, palladium, or platinum catalysts, and other reagents as described by P.M. Rylander in "Hydrogenation Methods," Academic Press, New York, 1985.<br>

SCHEME 4(Scheme Removed)<br><br>
Amines and alkylating agents useful for the above syntheses are described and prepared as set forth in the section entitled PREPARATIONS below.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of Formula I wherein B is N are prepared by reductive amination of an aldehyde containing the appropriate suitably protected aC1dic functionality with an amine. This sequence is set forth in SCHEME 5. Alternatively, the amine may contain the appropriate suitably protected aC1dic functionality.<br>
The reductive amination is typically carried out at a pH of between 6 and 8, using a reduC1ng agent such as sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride. The reaction is normally performed in a protic solvent such as methanol or ethanol at temperatures of about -78°C to about 40°C. (e.g., see A. Abdel-Magid, C. Maryanoff, K. Carson, Tetrahedron Lett. 39, 31, 5595-5598, 1990.) The reductive amination reaction may also be carried out using titanium isopropoxide and sodium cyanoborohydride (R.J. Mattson et al, J. Org. Chem.<br>
1990, 55, 2552-4) or by preformation of the imine under dehydrating conditions followed by reduction. The resulting amine of Formulas 42 and 42A, is transformed to the desired amide or sulfonamide by coupling with an aC1d chloride, sulfonyl chloride, or carboxylic aC1d as set forth in SCHEMES 3 and 4. If desired, the amine intermediate of Formulas 42 or 42A may be converted to a urethane by treatment with a chloroformate or to a tetrasubstituted urea by treatment with a chlorocarbonyl amide. These reactions are performed in the presence of a weak base such as triethylamine, pyridine, or 4-methylmorpholine in an aprotic solvent such as methylene chloride or diethyl ether at a temperature of about -20°C to about 50°C. Conversion of the amine of Formulas 42 or 42A to a trisubstituted urea is accomplished by treatment with an isocyanate in an aprotic solvent such as methylene chloride or diethyl ether at temperatures ranging between -20°C and 50°C (for example, see SCHEME 5A). In cases where the amine is present as the hydrochloride salt, it is preferable to add an equivalent of a suitable base such as triethylamine to the reaction. If desired, hydrolysis of the resulting sulfonamide or amide provides the corresponding aC1d.<br>

Aldehydes useful in the above SCHEME 5 are described and prepared as set forth in the section entitled PREPARATIONS below.<br>
Compounds of Formula I where B is N and Z is tetrazolyl are prepared as set forth in SCHEME 6. A sulfonamide or amide of Formula 4 is alkylated with the appropriate alkyl halide or sulfonate (wherein X' is halide or sulfonate), preferably a primary, secondary, benzylic, or allylic alkyl bromide, iodide, or sulfonate, which contains a nitrile to provide a nitrile of Formula 59. This alkylation is achieved by treatment of the sulfonamide or amide of Formula 59 with a base such as sodium hydride, lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, potassium tert-butoxide, or potassium carbonate in an aprotic solvent such as dimethylformamide, dimethylformamide/benzene, or acetone followed by reaction of the resulting anion with a suitable alkylating agent. Alkylation occurs at a temperature of about -78°C to about 100°C. A preferred method for converting the resulting nitrile of Formula 59 to the tetrazole of Formula 60 is treatment of the alkylated nitrile with dibutyltin oxide and trimethylsilylazide, in refluxing toluene<br><br>
(S.J. Wittenberger and B.C. Dormer, J. Org. Chem. 1993, 58, 4139-4141, 1993). For a review of alternative preparations of tetrazoles see R.N. Butler, Tetrazoles, In Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry; Potts, K.T. Ed.; Pergamon Press: Oxford, 1984, Vol. 5, pp 791-838.<br>

Alternatively, certain compounds of Formula I wherein B is N are prepared as set forth in SCHEME 7. Thus, esters of Formula 46 are prepared using the procedures described above in SCHEMES 1 and 2. Subsequent Heck coupling of this intermediate to an arylhalide (preferably an aryl bromide or aryl iodide), an aryl triflate, or a ring system which contains a vinyl bromide, iodide, or triflate is accomplished with a palladium catalyst, such as palladium acetate or tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) in the presence of a trialkylamine, such as triethylamine. In some cases, an additive such as a triarylphosphine or triarylarsene may be added to the reaction. The reaction is typically performed in an aprotic solvent such as dimethylformamide or acetonitrile at a temperature of about 0°C to about 150°C (see R.F. Heck in Comp. Org. Syn., Vol. 4, Ch. 4.3, p. 833 or Daves and Hallberg, Chem. Rev. 1989, 89, 1433). If desired, the compound<br>
f Formula 47 can be hydrolyzed to the corresponding aC1d. Alternatively, the compound of Formula 47 can be hydrogenated and, if desired, further hydrolyzed to the corresponding aC1d of Formula 49. Hydrogenation is preferably achieved under a hydrogen atmosphere typically at 0 to 50 psi in the presence of a palladium or platinum catalyst in an alcoholic solvent such as ethanol or methanol at a temperature of about 0°C to about 50°C. In cases where M represents a partially saturated ring system, hydrogenation will generate a fully saturated ring system.<br>

Alternatively, certain compounds of Formula I wherein B is N are prepared as described in SCHEME 8. Compounds of Formula 51 are prepared as described in SCHEMES 1 and 2 by alkylation of compounds of Formula 5 with an electrophile of Formula 2 which contains the appropriate functionality on the M hng. At least one of the substituents on the M ring must be suitable for subsequent conversion to an aldehyde. For example, electrophiles of Formula 2<br>
containing a protected alcohol on the M ring may be alkylated and then deprotected and oxidized to the aldehyde, using reagents well known to those skilled in the art, to generate compounds of Formula 51. An alternative method is to alkylate with an electrophile of Formula 2 where M contains a vinyl group. After alkylation, oxidative cleavage of the double bond provides the desired aldehyde of Formula 51. The oxidative cleavage is accomplished by transforming the double bond to the 1,2-diol with catalytic osmium tetroxide and N-methylmorpholine followed by oxidative cleavage to the aldehyde using sodium periodate. Alternatively, oxidative cleavage via ozonolysis followed by reduction using reagents such as methyl sulfide, triphenylphosphine, zinc/acetic aC1d, or thiourea, generates the desired aldehyde of Formula 51. Addition of LMetal where LMetal is any organometallic reagent such as an organolithium or a Grignard reagent in an aprotic solvent such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran at a temperature of about -78°C to about 80°C, followed by hydrolysis of the ester as described above, provides the desired compound of Formula 50.<br>

Alternatively, certain compounds of Formula I wherein B is N are prepared as described in SCHEME 9. The appropriate sulfonamide or amide of Formula 5 is alkylated using the conditions described in SCHEMES 1 and 2. The alkylating agent is an electrophile which contains an aromatic bromide or iodide or a ring system which contains a vinyl bromide or iodide (Ar1) to provide compounds of Formula 53. Suzuki-type coupling of the compound of Formula 53 thus obtained<br><br>
with an aryl boronic aC1d (Ar2) provides Formula 53a compounds. For a review of the Suzuki reaction see A.R. Martin and Y. Yang in Acta Chem. Scand. 1993, 47, 221. The coupling reaction is achieved using about two equivalents of a base, such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, thallium hydroxide or potassium phosphate, in the presence of a palladium catalyst, such as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladiurn(0), palladium acetate, palladium chloride, tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) or [1,4-<br>
bis(diphenylphosphine)butane]palladium(0). The reaction may be run in an aqueous alcoholic solvent such as methanol or ethanol; or in other aqueous solvents such as aqueous tetrahydrofuran, aqueous acetone, aqueous glycol dimethyl ether, or aqueous benzene at temperatures ranging from about 0°C to about 120°C. When Ar1 is a partially saturated ring, reduction of the ring to provide a saturated ring system may, if desired, be performed at this point. This transformation is achieved by hydrogenating the partially saturated ring in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium or platinum in an alcoholic solvent (ethanol or methanol) and/or ethyl acetate. Ester hydrolysis of compounds of Formulas 53 or 53a, if desired, provides the corresponding aC1d. The resulting aC1ds may contain functional groups on either of the ring systems (Ar1 or Ar2) which can be modified using methods well known to those skilled in the art. Examples of such modifications are shown in SCHEME 10.<br>

Intermediate 58 is coupled with a variety of aryl alcohols (M is as defined above) using Mitsonobu coupling conditions (for a review see O. Mitsonobu, Synthesis, 1, 1981). Typically the coupling is achieved by addition of a coupling agent such as triphenylphosphine and diethyl azodicarboxylate or diisopropyl azodicarboxylate in an inert solvent such as methylene chloride or tetrahydrofuran at a temperature of about 0°C to about 80°C.

The resulting Formula 117 disubstituted keto esters are hydrolyzed and decarboxylated to give the corresponding Formula 118 compound by using an aqueous base such as sodium hydroxide to hydrolyze the ester, followed by an aC1dic quench such as with aqueous hydrochloric aC1d to effect decarboxylation.<br>

ALKYLATING AGENTSNumerous methods exist for the synthesis of the desired alkylating agents used in the above procedures and are known to those skilled in the art (see "The Chemistry of the Carbon-Halogen Bond," Ed. S. Patai, J. Wiley, New York, 1973 and "The Chemistry of Halides, Pseudo-Halides, and Azides," Eds. S. Patai and Z. Rappaport, J. Wiley, New York, 1983). Some examples are shown in SCHEMES 20-24. As shown in SCHEME 20, tolyl or allylic substrates can be converted via halogenation to benzylic or allylic bromides wherein M, X, W and Z are as described above in the Summary of the Invention. This reaction is typically performed with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of a radical initiator such as 2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) or a peroxide, preferably benzoyl peroxide.

Suzuki-type coupling of an aryl iodide or bromide or a ring system containing a vinyl bromide or iodide (Ar2) with a methylaryl boronic aC1d (Ar1) using the conditions described in SCHEME 9 provides compounds of Formula 34. Where a vinyl bromide or iodide is used, compounds of Formula 34 can be reduced to generate a fully saturated ring. The reduction is accomplished by hydrogenation in the presence of palladium or platinum catalysts typically in protic solvents such as methanol or ethanol; or in tetrahydrofuran or ethyl acetate. Halogenation of the methyl group using reagents and conditions as described in SCHEME 20 provides alkylating agents of Formula 35.<br><br>
SCHEME 22 (Scheme Removed)<br><br>
Another common method for accessing alkyl halides is by halogenation of an alcohol or an alcohol derivative. Alcohols are obtained from commerC1al sources or can be prepared using methods well known to those skilled in the art. For example, SCHEME 22 sets forth the reduction of a carboxylic aC1d or ester to the corresponding alcohol using reagents such as, but not limited to, sodium borohydride, lithium aluminum hydride, borane-tetrahydrofuran complex, borane-methyl sulfide complex, etc. The corresponding alkyl chlorides are typically prepared from the alcohols with reagents such as hydrogen chloride, thionyl chloride, phosphorous pentachloride, phosphorous oxychloride, or triphenylphosphine/carbon tetrachloride. For the preparation of alkyl bromides, the alcohol is commonly treated with reagents such as hydrogen bromide, phosphorous tribromide, triphenylphosphine/bromine, or carbonyldiimidazole/allyl bromide (Kamijo, T., Harada, H., lizuka, K. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1983, 38, 4189). To access alkyl iodides, an appropriate alcohol is typically reacted with reagents such as triphenylphosphine/iodine/imidazole or hydogen iodide. Alternatively, alkyl chlorides can be converted to the more reactive alkyl bromides or alkyl iodides by reaction with an inorganic salt such as sodium bromide, lithium bromide, sodium iodide, or potassium iodide in solvents such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone. Alkyl sulfonates can also be used as electrophiles or can be converted to alkyl halides. Alkyl sulfonates are prepared from the corresponding alcohol using a mild base such as triethylamine or pyridine and a sulfonyl chloride in an inert solvent such as methylene chloride or diethyl ether. If desired, conversion to the halide is accomplished by treating the alkyl sulfonate with an inorganic halide (sodium iodide, sodium bromide, potassium iodide, potassium bromide, lithium chloride, lithium bromide, etc) or a tetrabutylammonium halide.<br>
SCHEME 23(Scheme Removed)<br><br>
C1nnamic acids or esters are commonly available from commercial sources and can by converted to alkylating agents of Formulas 37 or 38 as follows (see SCHEME 23). The cinnamic acid or ester derivatives are reduced by hydrogenation in the presence of palladium or platinum catalysts typically in protic solvents (e.g., methanol orethanol), tetrahydrofuran, or ethyl acetate. Reduction and conversion to the alkyl halide or sulfonate as described in SCHEME 22 provides the compounds of Formula 38. Where appropriate, the cinnamic acids or esters are converted directly to the alcohols of Formula 39 by treat those cinnamic acids or esters with reagents such as lithium aluminum hydride in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran and diethyl ether. Alternatively, the cinnamic acid or ester can be reduced to an allylic alcohol of Formula 40 using reagents such as lithium aluminum hydride/aluminum chloride, diisobutylaluminum hydride or lithium<br>
borohydride. Conversion to the allylic halide or sulfonate as described in SCHEME 22 provides the compounds of Formula 37.<br>

The preparation of alkylating agents of Formula 41 wherein W and M are as described above in the Summary of the Invention is set forth in SCHEME 24.

Some preferred bases include, but are not limited to, sodium hydroxide, sodium hydride, lithium diisopropylamide, lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide and potassium tert-butoxide. Treatment of the resulting anion with one of a variety of dialkylhalides generates the desired alkylating agents of Formula 41. For the preparation of compounds where W is an oxygen and M is an aromatic ring, it is preferred to form the alkoxide anion with sodium hydroxide followed by addition of a dihaloalkane, e.g. dibromoalkane. The reaction is normally performed in water at about 75°C to about 125°C.<br><br>

S. Patai, IntersC1ence, New York (1966-70)). SCHEME 25 demonstrates an exemplary method used to prepare Formula 43 hydroxy aldehydes where M in SCHEME 5 contains a hydroxy substituted alkyl group. Treatment of a dialdehyde, where one of the aldehydes is protected as an acetal of Formula 44 wherein the OR groups are conventional substituents used in an acetal protecting group, with an organometallic reagent (LMetal), preferably an organolithium or Grignard reagent, in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether, provides compounds of Formula 45. Subsequent acetal hydrolysis under mildly aC1dic conditions, e.g., dilute hydrogen chloride, Amberlyst-15® resin, silica gel, or other reagents as described in "Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis," Second Edition, T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1991 provides the desired hydroxy aldehydes of Formula 43.<br>
Aldehydes useful for the method described in SCHEME 5 may be prepared using the methods described in SCHEMES 26-28. For example, as shown in SCHEME 26, an aryl boronic aC1d which contains an aldehyde can be coupled to an aryl bromide, aryl iodide, or a ring system which contains a vinyl bromide or<br>
iodide using the Suzuki protocol described for SCHEME 9 to provide aldehydes of Formula 60.<br>
SCHEME 27 describes the preparation of aldehydes of Formula 62 which contain a suitably protected aC1d moiety and can be used for the preparation of compounds of Formula 42A described in SCHEME 5. Selective reduction of nitriles (see SCHEMES 3-4 for preparations) of Formula 61 provides aldehydes of Formula 62. A preferred method for this reduction involves heating the nitrile with aluminum-nickel (Raney) alloy in the presence of an aC1d such as formic aC1d. Aldehydes of Formula 64 useful for the preparation of compounds of Formula 42 (SCHEME 5) may be prepared from starting nitriles of Formula 63 by treatment with a variety of reduC1ng agents such as diisobutylaluminum hydride, tin (II) chloride/hydrogen chloride, or lithium triethoxyalanate.<br>

Any prostaglandin, or prostaglandin agonist/antagonist may be used as the second compound in certain aspects of this invention. This includes utilizing two different compounds of Formula I of this inventon. Those skilled in the art will recognize that IGF-1, sodium fluoride, parathyroid hormone (PTH), active fragments of parathyroid hormone, growth hormone or growth hormone secretagogues may also be used. The following paragraphs describe exemplary second compounds of this invention in greater detail.<br>
Any prostaglandin may be used as the second compound in certain aspects of this invention. The term prostaglandin refers to compounds which are<br><br>
analogs of the natural prostaglandins PGD,, PGD2, PGE2, PGEi and PGF2 which are useful in the treatment of osteoporosis. These compounds bind to the prostaglandin receptors. Such binding is readily determined by those skilled in the art of standard assays (e.g., An S. et al., Cloning and Expression of the EP2 Subtype of Human Receptors for Prostaglandin E2, Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, 1993, 197(1):263-270).<br>
Prostaglandins are alicyclic compounds related to the basic compound prostanoic aC1d. The carbon atoms of the basic prostaglandin are numbered sequentially from the carboxylic carbon atom through the cyclopentyl ring to the terminal carbon atom on the adjacent side chain. Normally the adjacent side chains are in the trans orientation. The presence of an oxo group at C-9 of the cyclopentyl moiety is indicative of a prostaglandin within the E class while PGE2 contains a trans unsaturated double bond at the C13-C14 and a C1s double bond at the C5-C6 position.<br>
A variety of prostaglandins are described and referenced below. However, other prostaglandins will be known to those skilled in the art. Exemplary prostaglandins are disclosed in U.S. patents 4,171,331 and 3,927,197, the disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>

The term parathyroid hormone refers to parathyroid hormone, fragments or metabolites thereof and structural analogs thereof which can stimulate bone formation and increase bone mass. Also included are parathyroid hormone related peptides and active fragments and analogs of parathyroid related peptides (see PCT publication no. WO 94/01460). Such bone anabolic functional activity is readily determined by those skilled in the art of standard assays (e.g., see Eriksen E.F. et al., Bone Histomorphometry, Raven Press, New York, 1994, pages 1-74; Grier S.J. et. al., The Use of Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry In Animals, Inv.

The term growth hormone secretagogue refers to a compound which stimulates the release of growth hormone or mimics the action of growth hormone (e.g., increases bone formation<br><br>
leading to increased bone mass). Such actions are readily determined by those skilled in the art of standard assays well known to those of skill in the art. A variety of these compounds are disclosed in the following published PCT patent applications: WO 95/14666; WO 95/13069; WO 94/19367; WO 94/13696; and WO 95/34311. However, other growth hormones or growth hormone secretagogues will be known to those skilled in the art.<br>
In particular a preferred growth hormone secretagogue is N-[1(R)-[1,2-Dihydro-1-methanesulfonylspiro[3H-indole-3,4'-piperidin]-1'-yl)carbonyl]-2-(phenylmethyloxy)ethyl]-2-amino-2-methylpropanamide:MK-677.<br>
Other preferred growth hormone secretagogues include<br>

2-amino-N-(1-(R)-benzyloxymethyl-2-(3a-(R)-(4-fluoro-benzyl)-2-methyl-3-oxo-2,3,3aA6,7-hexahydro-pyrazolo[4,3-c]pyridin-5-yl)-2-oxo-ethyl)isobutyramide;<br>
2-amino-N-(2-(3a-(R)-benzyl-3-oxo-2,3,3a,4,6,7-hexahydro-pyrazolo[4,3-c]pyridin-5-yl)-1-(R)benzyloxymethyl-2-oxo-ethyl)isobutyramide; and<br>

Some of the preparation methods useful for the preparation of the compounds described herein may require protection of remote functionality (e.g., primary amine, secondary amine, carboxyl in Formula I precursors). The need for such protection will vary depending on the nature of the remote functionality and the conditions of the preparation methods. The need for such protection is readily determined by one skilled in the art. The use of such protection/deprotection methods is also within the skill in the art. For a general description of protecting groups and their use, see T.W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis. John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1991.<br>
The starting materials and reagents for the above described compounds are also readily available or can be easily synthesized by those skilled in the art using conventional methods of organic synthesis. For example, many of the compounds used herein are related to, or are derived from, compounds found in<br><br>
nature, in which there is a large sC1entific interest and commerC1al need, and accordingly many such compounds are commerC1ally available or are reported in the literature or are easily prepared from other commonly available substances by methods which are reported in the literature. Such compounds include, for example, prostaglandins.<br>
It will be recognized by persons of ordinary skill in the art that some of the compounds of this invention have at least one asymmetric carbon atom and therefore are enantiomers or diastereomers. Diasteromeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physicochemical differences by methods known perse as, for example, by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diasteromeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., alcohol), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing, including both chemical hydrolysis methods and microbial lipase hydrolysis methods, e.g., enzyme catalyzed hydrolysis) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. All such isomers, including diastereomers, enantiomers and mixtures thereof are considered as part of this invention. Also, some of the compounds of this invention are atropisomers (e.g., substituted biaryls) and are considered as part of this invention.<br>
Many of the compounds of this invention, including the compounds of Formula I, the anti-resorptive agents, bone anabolic agents, prostaglandin agonists/antagonists, parathyroid hormones, growth hormones and growth hormone secretagogues, are aC1dic and they form a salt with a pharmaceutically acceptable cation. Some of the compounds of this invention, including the compounds of Formula I, the anti-resorptive agents, bone anabolic agents, prostaglandin agonists/antagonists, parathyroid hormones, growth hormones and growth hormone secretagogues, are basic and they form a salt with a pharmaceutically acceptable anion. All such salts are within the scope of this invention and they can be prepared by conventional methods. For example, they can be prepared simply by contacting the acidic and basic entities, usually in a stoichiometric ratio, in either an aqueous, non-aqueous or partially aqueous medium, as appropriate. The salts are recovered either by filtration, by<br><br>
preC1pitation with a non-solvent followed by filtration, by evaporation of the solvent, or, in the case of aqueous solutions, by lyophilization, as appropriate.<br>
In addition, when the compounds of this invention, including the compounds of Formula I, the anti-resorptive agents, bone anabolic agents, prostaglandin agonists/antagonists, parathyroid hormones, growth hormones and growth hormone secretagogues, form hydrates or solvates they are also within the scope of the invention.<br>
In addition, all prodrugs of the compounds of this invention, including the compounds of Formula I, the anti-resorptive agents, bone anabolic agents, prostaglandin agonists/antagonists, parathyroid hormones, growth hormones and growth hormone secretagogues, are within the scope of this invention.<br>
The compounds of this invention, prodrugs thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds and prodrugs are all adapted to therapeutic use as agents that stimulate bone formation and increase bone mass in a vertebrates, e.g., mammals, and particularly humans. Since bone formation is closely related to the development of osteoporosis and bone related disorders, these compounds, prodrugs thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds and said prodrugs, by virtue of their action on bone, prevent, arrest and/or regress osteoporosis.<br>
The utility of the compounds of the present invention as medical agents in the treatment of conditions which present with low bone mass (e.g., osteoporosis) in a vertebrates, e.g., mammals (e.g. humans, particularly the female) is demonstrated by the activity of the compounds of this invention in conventional assays, including an in vivo assay, a receptor binding assay, a cyclic AMP assay and a fracture healing assay (all of which are described below). The in vivo assay (with appropriate modifications within the skill in the art) may be used to determine the activity of other anabolic agents as well as the prostaglandin agonists of this invention. The estrogen agonist/antagonist protocol may be used to determine the activity of estrogen agonists/antagonists in particular and also other anti-resorptive agents (with appropriate modifications within the skill in the art). The combination and sequential treatment protocol described below is useful for demonstrating the utility of the combinations of the anabolic agents (e.g., the compounds of this invention) and anti-resorptive agents (e.g., estrogen agonists/antagonists)<br><br>
described herein. Such assays also provide a means whereby the activities of the compounds of this invention (or the other anabolic agents and anti-resorptive agents described herein) can be compared to each other and with the activities of other known compounds. The results of these comparisons are useful for determining dosage levels in a vertebrates, e.g., mammals, including humans, for the treatment of such diseases.<br>
Anabolic Agent In Vivo Assay<br>
The activity of anabolic bone agents in stimulating bone formation and increasing bone mass can be tested in intact male or female rats, sex hormone defiC1ent male (orchidectomy) or female (ovariectomy) rats.<br>
Male or female rats at different ages (such as 3 months of age) can be used in the study. The rats are either intact or castrated (ovariectomized or orchidectomized), and subcutaneously injected or gavaged with prostaglandin agonists at different doses (such as 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg/day) for 30 days. In the castrated rats, treatment is started at the next day after surgery (for the purpose of preventing bone loss) or at the time bone loss has already occured (for the purpose of restoring bone mass). During the study, all rats are allowed free access to water and a pelleted commerC1al diet (Teklad Rodent Diet #8064, Marian Teklad, Madison, Wl) containing 1.46% calC1um, 0.99% phosphorus and 4.96 IU/g of Vitamin 03. All rats are given subcutaneous injections of 10 mg/kg calcein on days 12 and 2 before sacrifice. The rats are sacrificed. The following endpoints are determined: Femoral Bone Mineral Measurements:<br>
The right femur from each rat is removed at autopsy and scanned using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, QDR 1000/W, Hologic Inc., Waltham, MA) equipped with "Regional High Resolution Scan" software (Hologic Inc., Waltham, MA). The scan field size is 5.08 x 1.902 cm, resolution is 0.0254 x 0.0127 cm and scan speed is 7.25 mm/second. The femoral scan images are analyzed and bone area, bone mineral content (BMC), and bone mineral density (BMD) of whole femora (WF), distal femoral metaphyses (DFM), femoral shaft (FS), and proximal femora (PF) are determined. Tibial Bone Histomorphometric Analyses:<br><br>
The right tibia is removed at autopsy, dissected free of muscle, and cut into three parts. The proximal tibia and the tibial shaft are fixed in 70% ethanol, dehydrated in graded concentrations of ethanol, defatted in acetone, then embedded in methyl methacrylate (Eastman Organic Chemicals, Rochester, NY).<br>
Frontal sections of proximal tibial metaphyses at 4 and 10 urn thickness are cut using a Reichert-Jung Polycut S microtome. The 4 urn sections are stained with modified Masson's Trichrome stain while the 10 urn sections remained unstained. One 4 µm and one 10 µm sections from each rat are used for cancellous bone histomorphometry.<br>
Cross sections of tibial shaft at 10 urn thickness are cut using a Reichert-Jung Polycut S microtome. These sections are used for cortical bone histomorphometric analysis.<br>
Cancellous bone histomorphometry: A Bioquant OS/2 histomorphometry system (R&amp;M Biometrics, Inc., Nashville, TN) is used for the static and dynamic histomorphometric measurements of the secondary spongiosa of the proximal tibial metaphyses between 1.2 and 3.6 mm distal to the growth plate-epiphyseal junction. The first 1.2 mm of the tibial metaphyseal region needs to be omitted in order to restrict measurements to the secondary spongiosa. The 4 urn sections are used to determine indices related to bone volume, bone structure, and bone resorption, while the 10 urn sections are used to determine indices related to bone formation and bone turnover.<br>

structure: (1) Total metaphyseal area (TV, mm2): metaphyseal area between 1.2 and 3.6 mm distal to the growth plate-epiphyseal junction. (2) Trabecular bone<br>
area (BV, mm2): total area of trabeculae within TV. (3) Trabecular bone perimeter (BS, mm): the length of total perimeter of trabeculae. (4) Trabecular bone volume (BV/TV, %): BV / TV x 100. (5) Trabecular bone number (TBN, #/mm): 1.199 / 2 x BS / TV. (6) Trabecular bone thickness (TBT, pm): (2000 /1.199) x (BV / BS).

Osteoclast number (OCN, #): total number of osteoclast within total metaphyseal<br>
area. (2) Osteoclast perimeter (OCR, mm): length of trabecular perimeter covered<br><br>
by osteoclast. (3) Osteoclast number/mm (OCN/mm, #/mm): OCN / BS. (4) Percent osteoclast perimeter (%OCP, %): OCR / BS x 100.<br>
Ill) Measurements and calculations related to bone formation and turnover: (1) Single-calcein labeled perimeter (SLS, mm): total length of trabecular perimeter labeled with one calcein label. (2) Double-calcein labeled perimeter (DLS, mm): total length of trabecular perimeter labeled with two calcein labels. (3) Inter-labeled width (ILW, urn): average distance between two calcein labels. (4) Percent mineralizing perimeter (PMS, %): (SLS/2 + DLS) / BS x 100. (5) Mineral apposition rate (MAR, urn/day): ILW/ label interval. (6) Bone formation rate/surface ref.<br>
(BFR/BS, um2/d/um): (SLS/2 + DLS) x MAR / BS. (7) Bone turnover rate (BTR, %/y): (SLS/2 + DLS) x MAR / BV x 100.<br>
Cortical bone histomorphometrv: A Bioquant OS/2 histomorphometry system (R&amp;M Biometrics, Inc., Nashville, IN) is used for the static and dynamic histomorphometric measurements of tibial shaft cortical bone. Total tissue area, marrow cavity area, periostea! perimeter, endocortical perimeter, single labeled perimeter, double labeled perimeter, and interlabeled width on both periostea! and endocortical surface are measured, and cortical bone area (total tissue area -marrow cavity area), percent cortical bone area (cortical area / total tissue area x 100), percent marrow area (marrow cavity area / total tissue area x 100), periostea! and endocortical percent labeled perimeter [(single labeled perimeter/2+double labeled perimeter) / total perimeter x 100], mineral apposition rate (interlabeled width/intervals), and bone formation rate [mineral apposition rate x [(single labeled perimeter/2+double labeled perimeter) / total perimeter] are calculated. Statistics<br>
Statistics can be calculated using StatView 4.0 packages (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) test followed by Fisher's PLSD (Stat View, Abacus Concepts Inc., 1918 Bonita Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704-1014) are used to compare the differences between groups.<br>
Determination of cAMP Elevation in 293-S Cell Lines Stably Overexpressino. Recombinant Human EP2 and EPj Receptors.<br>
cDNAs representing the complete open reading frames of the human EP2 and EP4 receptors are generated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide primers based on published sequences (1, 2) and<br><br>
RNA from primary human kidney cells (EP2) or primary human lung cells (EP4) as templates. cDNAs are cloned into the multiple cloning site of pcDNAS (Invitrogen Corporation, 3985B Sorrento Valley Blvd., San Diego, CA 92121) and used to transfect 293-S human embryonic kidney cells via calC1um phosphate co-preC1pitation. G418-resistant colonies are expanded and tested for speC1fic [3H]PGE2 binding. Transfectants demonstrating high levels of speC1fic [3H]PGE2 binding are further characterized by Scatchard analysis to determine Bmax and Kds for PGE2. The lines selected for compound screening have approximately 338,400 receptors per cell and a Kd = 12 nM for PGE2 (EP2), and approximately 256,400 receptors per cell and a Kd = 2.9 nM for PGE2 (EP4). Constituitive expression of both receptors in parental 293-S cells is negligible. Cells are maintained in RPMI supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10% final) and G418 (700 ug/ml final).<br>
cAMP responses in the 293-S/EP2 and 293-S/EP4 lines are determined by detaching cells from culture flasks in 1 ml of Ca++ and Mg++ defiC1ent PBS via vigorous pounding, adding serum-free RPMI to a final concentration of 1 X 106 cells/ml, and adding 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) to a final concentration of 1 mM. One milliliter of cell suspension is immediately aliquoted into individual 2 ml screwcap microcentrifuge and incubated for 10 minutes, uncovered, at 37 °C, 5% CO2,95% relative humdity. The compound to be tested is then added to cells at 1:100 dilutions such that final DMSO or ethanol concentrations is 1%. Immediately after adding compound, the tubes are covered, mixed by inverting two times, and incubated at 37 °C for 12 minutes. Samples are then lysed by incubation at 100 °C for 10 minutes and immediately cooled on ice for 5 minutes. Cellular debris is pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 X g for 5 minutes, and cleared lysates are transferred to fresh tubes. cAMP concentrations are determined using a commerC1ally available cAMP radioimmunoassay kit RIA (NEK-033, DuPont/NEN Research Products, 549 Albany St., Boston, MA 02118) after diluting cleared lysates 1:10 in cAMP RIA assay buffer (included in kit). Typically, one treats cells with 6-8 concentrations of the compound to be tested in 1 log increments. EC50 calculations are performed on a calculator using linear regression analysis on the linear portion of the dose response curves. References<br><br>

Unlysed cells and debris are removed by centrifugation at 100 x g for 10 min. Membranes are then harvested by centrifugation at 45,000 x g for 30 minutes. Pelleted membranes are resuspended to 3-10 mg protein per ml, protein concentration being determined of the method of Bradford [Bradford, M., Anal. Biochem., 72, 248 (1976)]. Resuspended membranes are then stored frozen at -80 °C until use.<br>
Binding Assay: Frozen membranes prepared as above are thawed and diluted to 1 mg protein per ml in Buffer A above. One volume of membrane preparation is combined with 0.05 volume test compound or buffer and one volume of 3 nM 3H-prostaglandin E2 (#TRK 431, Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL) in Buffer A. The mixture (205 µL total volume) is incubated for 1 hour at 25°C. The membranes are then recovered by filtration through type GF/C glass fiber filters ( #1205-401, Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD ) using a Tomtec harvester ( Model Mach II/96, Tomtec, Orange, CT). The membranes with bound 3H-prostaglandin E2 are trapped by the filter, while the buffer and unbound 3H-prostaglandin E2 pass through the filter into waste. Each sample is then washed 3 times with 3 ml of [50<br><br>
mM Tris-HC1 (pH 7.4), 10 mM MgC12, 1 mM EDTA]. The filters are then dried by heating in a microwave oven. To determine the amount of 3H-prostaglandin bound to the membranes, the dried filters are placed into plastic bags with sC1ntillation fluid and counted in a LKB 1205 Betaplate reader (Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD). IC50s are determined from the concentration of test compound required to displace 50% of the speC1fically bound 3H-prostaglandin E2.<br>
The full length EPi receptor is made as disclosed in Funk et al., Journal of Biological Chemistry, 1993, 268, 26767-26772. The full length EP2 receptor is made as disclosed in Regan et al., Molecular Pharmacology, 1994, 46, 213-220. The full length EP3 receptor is made as disclosed in Regan et al., British Journal of Pharmacology, 1994, 112, 377-385. The full length EP4 receptor is made as disclosed in Bastien, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 1994, 269, 11873-11877. These full length receptors are used to prepare 293S cells expressing the EPi, EP2, EP3 and EP4 receptors.<br>
293S cells expressing either the human EPi, EP2, EP3 or EP4 prostaglandin E2 receptors are generated according to methods known to those skilled in the art. Typically, PCR (polymerase chain reaction) primers corresponding to the 5' and 3' ends of the published full length receptor are made according to the well known methods disclosed above and are used in an RT-PCR reaction using the total RNA from human kidney (for EPi), human lung (for EP2), human lung (for EP3) or human lymphocytes (for EP4) as a source. PCR products are cloned by the TA overhang method into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and identity of the cloned receptor is confirmed by DMA sequenC1ng.<br>
293S cells (Mayo, Dept. of Biochemistry, Northwestern Univ.) are transfected with the cloned receptor in pcDNA3 by electroporation. Stable cell lines expressing the receptor are established following selection of transfected cells with G418.<br>
Clonal cell lines expressing the maximal number of receptors are chosen following a whole cell 3H-PGE2 binding assay using unlabeled PGE2 as a competitor.<br>
FRACTURE HEALING ASSAYS<br>
ASSAY FOR EFFECTS ON FRACTURE HEALING AFTER SYSTEMIC<br>
ADMINISTRATION<br>
Fracture Technique; Sprage-Dawley rats at 3 months of age are anesthetized with Ketamine. A 1 cm inC1sion is made on the anteromedial aspect of the proximal part of the right tibia or femur. The following describes the tibial surgical technique. The inC1sion is carried through to the bone, and a 1 mm hole is drilled 4 mm proximal to the distal aspect of the tibial tuberosity 2 mm medial to the anterior ridge. Intramedullary nailing is performed with a 0.8 mm stainless steel tube (maximum load 36.3 N, maximum stiffness 61.8 N/mm, tested under the same conditions as the bones). No reaming of the medullary canal is performed. A standardized closed fracture is produced 2 mm above the tibiofibular junction by three-point bending using speC1ally designed adjustable forceps with blunt jaws. To minimize soft tissue damage, care is taken not to displace the fracture. The skin is closed with monofilament nylon sutures. The operation is performed under sterile conditions. Radiographs of all fractures are taken immediately after nailing, and rats with fractures outside the speC1fied diaphyseal area or with displaced nails are excluded. The remaining animals are divided randomly into the following groups with 10-12 animals per each subgroup per time point for testing the fracture healing. The first group receives daily gavage of vehicle (water: 100% Ethnanol = 95 : 5) at 1 ml/rat, while the others receive daily gavage from 0.01 to 100 mg/kg/day of the compound to be tested (1 ml/rat) for 10, 20, 40 and 80 days.<br>
At 10, 20, 40 and 80 days, 10-12 rats from each group are anesthetized with Ketamine and sacrificed by exsanguination. Both tibiofibular bones are removed by dissection and all soft tissue is stripped. Bones from 5 - 6 rats for each group are stored in 70% ethanol for histological analysis, and bones from another 5 - 6 rats for each group are stored in a buffered Ringer's solution (+4°C, pH 7.4) for radiographs and biomechanical testing which is performed.<br>
Histological Analysis: The methods for histologic analysis of fractured bone have been previously published by Mosekilde and Bak (The Effects of Growth Hormone on Fracture Healing in Rats: A Histological Description. Bone, 14:19-27, 1993). Briefly, the fracture side is sawed 8 mm to each side of the fracture line, embedded undecalC1fied in methymethacrylate, and cut frontals sections on a<br>
Reichert-Jung Polycut microtome in 8 urn thick. Masson-Trichrome stained mid-frontal sections (including both tibia and fibula) are used for visualization of the cellullar and tissue response to fracture healing with and without treatment. Sirius red stained sections are used to demonstrate the characteristics of the callus structure and to differentiate between woven bone and lamellar bone at the fracture site. The following measurements are performed: (1) fracture gap -easured as the shortest distance between the cortical bone ends in the fracture, (2) callus length and callus diameter, (3) total bone volume area of callus, (4) bony tissue per tissue area inside the callus area, (5) fibrous tissue in the callus, and (6) cartilage area in the callus.<br>
Biomechanical Analysis: The methods for biomechanical analysis have been previously published by Bak and Andreassen (The Effects of Aging on Fracture Healing in Rats. CalC1f Tissue Int 45:292-297, 1989). Briefly, radiographs of all fractures are taken prior to the biomechanical test. The mechanical properties of the healing fractures are analyzed by a destructive three- or four-point bending procedure. Maximum load, stiffness, energy at maximum load, deflection at maximum load, and maximum stress are determined.<br>
ASSAY FOR EFFECTS ON FRACTURE HEALING AFTER LOCAL<br>
ADMINISTRATION<br>
Fracture Technique: Female or male beagle dogs at approximately 2 years of age are used under anesthesia in the study. Transverse radial fractures are produced by slow continuous loading in three-point bending as described by Lenehan etal. (Lenehan, T. M.; Balligand, M.; Nunamaker, D.M.; Wood, F.E.: Effects of EHDP on Fracture Healing in Dogs. J Orthop Res 3:499-507; 1985). The wire is pulled through the fracture site to ensure complete anatomical disruption of the bone. Thereafter, local delivery of prostaglandin agonists to the fracture site is achieved by slow release of compound delivered by slow release pellets or by administration of the compounds in a suitable Formulation such as a paste gel solution or suspension for 10, 15, or 20 weeks.<br>
Histological Analysis: The methods for histologic analysis of fractured bone have been previously published by Peter et al. (Peter, C.P.; Cook, W.O.; Nunamaker, D.M.; Provost, M. T.; Seedor, J.G.; Rodan, G.A. Effects of alendronate on fracture healing and bone remodeling in dogs. J. Orthop. Res.<br>
14:74-70, 1996) and Mosekilde and Bak (The Effects of Growth Hormone on Fracture Healing in Rats: A Histological Description. Bone, 14:19-27, 1993). Briefly, after sacrifice, the fracture side is sawed 3 cm to each side of the fracture line, embedded undecalcified in methymethacrylate, and cut on a Reichert-Jung Polycut microtome in 8 urn thick of frontal sections. Masson-Trichrome stained mid-frontal sections (including both tibia and fibula) are used for visualization of the cellullar and tissue response to fracture healing with and without treatment. Sirius red stained sections are used to demonstrate the characterisitics of the callus structure and to differentiate between woven bone and lamellar bone at the fracture site. The following measurements are performed: (1) fracture gap -measured as the shortest distance between the cortical bone ends in the fracture, (2) callus length and callus diameter, (3) total bone volume area of callus, (4) bony tissue per tissue area inside the callus area, (5) fibrous tissue in the callus, (6) cartilage area in the callus.<br>
Biomechanical Analysis: The methods for biomechanical analysis have been previously published by Bak and Andreassen (The Effects of Aging on Fracture Healing in Rats. Calcif Tissue Int 45:292-297, 1989) and Peter et al. (Peter, C.P.; Cook, W.O.; Nunamaker, D.M.; Provost, M. T.; Seedor, J.G.; Rodan, G.A. Effects of Alendronate On Fracture Healing And Bone Remodeling In Dogs. J. Orthop. Res. 14:74-70, 1996). Briefly, radiographs of all fractures are taken prior to the biomechanical test. The mechanical properties of the healing fractures are analyzed by a destructive three- or four-point bending procedures. Maximum load, stiffness, energy at maximum load, deflection at maximum load, and maximum stress are determined.<br>
ESTROGEN AGONIST/ANTAGONIST PROTOCOL<br>
Estrogen agonist/antagonists are a class of compounds which inhibit bone turnover and prevent estrogen-defiC1ency induced bone loss. The ovariectomized rat bone loss model has been widely used as a model of postmenopausal bone loss. Using this model, one can test the efficacy of the estrogen agonist/antagonist compounds in preventing bone loss and inhibiting bone resorption.<br>
Sprague-Dawley female rats (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) at different ages (such as 5 months of age) are used in these studies. The rats are singly housed in 20 cm X 32 cm X 20 cm cages during the experimental period. All rats<br>
are allowed free access to water and a pelleted commercial diet (Agway Pro Lab 3000, Agway County Food, Inc., Syracuse, NY) containing 0.97% calC1um, 0.85% phosphorus, and 1.05 ILJ/g of Vitamin D3<br>
A group of rats (8 to 10) are sham-operated and treated p.o. with vehicle (10% ethanol and 90% saline, 1 ml/day), while the remaining rats are bilaterally ovariectomized (OVX) and treated with either vehicle (P.O.), 17p-estradiol (Sigma, E-8876, E2, 30 ug/kg, daily subcutaneous injection), or estrogen agonist/antagonists (such as droloxifene at 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg, daily p.o.) for a certain period (such as 4 weeks). All rats are given subcutaneous injections of 10 mg/kg calcein (fluorochrome bone marker) 12 and 2 days before being sacrificed in order to examine the dynamic changes in bone tissue. After 4 weeks of treatment, the rats are sacrificed and autopsied. The following endpoints are determined:<br>
Body Weight Gain: Body weight at autopsy minus body weight at surgery.<br>
Uterine Weight and Histology: The uterus is removed from each rat during autopsy, and weighed immediately. Thereafter, the uterus is processed for histologic measurements such as uterine cross-sectional tissue area, stromal thickness, and luminal epithelial thickness.<br>
Total Serum Cholesterol: Blood is obtained by cardiac puncture and allowed to clot at 4°C, and then centrifuged at 2,000 g for 10 min. Serum samples are analyzed for total serum cholesterol using a high performance cholesterol calorimetric assay (Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN).<br>
Femoral Bone Mineral Measurements: The right femur from each rat is removed at autopsy and scanned using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA, QDR 1000/W, Hologic Inc., Waltham, MA) equipped with "Regional High Resolution Scan" software (Hologic Inc., Waltham, MA). The scan field size is 5.08 x 1.902 cm, resolution is 0.0254 x 0.0127 cm and scan speed is 7.25 mm/second. The femoral scan images are analyzed and bone area, bone mineral content (BMC), and bone mineral density (BMD) of whole femora (WF), distal femoral metaphyses (DFM), femoral shaft (FS), and proximal femora (PF) are determined.<br>
Proximal Tibial Metaphyseal Cancellous Bone Histomorphometric Analyses: The right tibia is removed at autopsy, dissected free of muscle, and cut into three parts. The proximal tibia is fixed in 70% ethanol, dehydrated in graded<br>
concentrations of ethanol, defatted in acetone, then embedded in methyl methacrylate (Eastman Organic Chemicals, Rochester, NY). Frontal sections of proximal tibial metaphyses at 4 and 10 pm thickness are cut using a Reichert-Jung Polycut S microtome. One 4 urn and one 10 pm sections from each rat are used for cancellous bone histomorphometry. The 4 urn sections are stained with modified Masson's Trichrome stain while the 10 urn sections remained unstained.<br>
A Bioquant OS/2 histomorphometry system (R&amp;M Biometrics, Inc., Nashville, TN) is used for the static and dynamic histomorphometric measurements of the secondary spongiosa of the proximal tibial metaphyses between 1.2 and 3.6 mm distal to the growth plate-epiphyseal junction. The first 1.2 mm of the tibial metaphyseal region is omitted in order to restrict measurements to the secondary spongiosa. The 4 urn sections are used to determine indices related to bone volume, bone structure, and bone resorption, while the 10 pm sections are used to determine indices related to bone formation and bone turnover.<br>

COMBINATION AND SEQUENTIAL TREATMENT PROTOCOL<br>
The following protocols can of course be varied by those skilled in the art. For example, intact male or female rats, sex hormone defiC1ent male (orchidectomy) or female (ovariectomy) rats may be used. In addition, male or female rats at different ages (such as 12 months of age) can be used in the studies. The rats can be either intact or castrated (ovariectomized or orchidectomized), and administered to with anabolic agents such as the compounds of this invention at different doses (such as 1, 3 or 6 mg/kg/day) for a certain period (such as two weeks to two months), and followed by administration of an anti-resorptive agent such as droloxifene at different doses (such as 1,5,10 mg/kg/day) for a certain period (such as two weeks to two months), or a combination treatment with both anabolic agent and anti-resorptive agent at different doses for a certain period (such as two weeks to two months). In the castrated rats, treatment can be started on the next day after surgery (for the purpose of preventing bone loss) or at the time bone loss has already occurred (for the purpose of restoring bone mass).<br>
The rats are sacrificed under ketamine anesthesia. The following endpoints are determined:<br>
Femoral bone mineral measurements are performed as described above in the estrogen agonist/antagonist protocol.<br>
Lumbar Vertebral Bone Mineral Measurements: Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (QDR 1000/W, Hologic, Inc., Waltham, MA) equipped with a "Regional High Resolution Scan" software (Hologic, Inc., Waltham, MA) is used to determined the bone area, bone mineral content (BMC), and bone mineral density (BMD) of whole lumbar spine and each of the six lumbar vertebrae (LV1 - 6) in the anesthetized rats. The rats are anesthetized by injection (i.p.) of 1 ml/kg of a mixture of ketamine/rompun (ratio of 4 to 3), and then placed on a rat platform. The scan field sized is 6 x 1.9 cm, resolution is 0.0254 x 0.0127 cm, and scan speed is 7.25 mm/sec. The whole lumbar spine scan image is obtained and analyzed. Bone area (BA), and bone mineral content (BMC) is determined, and bone mineral density is calculated (MBC divided by BA) for the whole lumbar spine and each of the six lumbar vertebrae (LV1 - 6).<br>
Proximal tibial metaphyseal cancellous bone histomorphometric analyses are performed as described above for in the estrogen agonist/antagonist protocol.<br>
Measurements and calculations related to trabecular bone volume and structure are performed as described above in the estrogen agonist/antagonist protocol. Further, measurements and calculations related to bone resorption are also performed as described above in the estrogen agonist/antagonist protocol. Still further, measurements and calculations related to bone formation and turnover are performed as described above in the estrogen agonist/antagonist protocol. Further still, the data obtained is analyzed using the statistical manipulations described above in the estrogen agonist/antagonist protocol.<br>
Kidney Regeneration Assay<br>
The role of an prostaglandin agonist in kidney regeneration is investigated by the ability of Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) or a prostaglandin agonist to induce the expression of Bone Morphogenetic Protein 7 (BMP-7) in wild type 293S cells and in 293S cells transfected with EP2.<br>
Methods: 293S and EP2 293S cells are grown in Dulbecco's Modified Egale medium (DMEM, Gibco, BRL; Gaithersburg, MD ). One day prior to<br>
treatment with PGE2 or an prostaglandin agonist, cells are plated at a density of 1.5 x106 cells /10 cm dish. Generally about 16 to 24 hours later the cell monolayer is washed once with OptiMEM (Gibco, BRL; Gaithersburg, MD) followed by the addition of 10 ml OptiMEM/dish in the presence and absense of vehicle (DMSO), PGE2 (10'6M) or a prostaglandin agonist (10"6M). Cells are harvested and RNA is extracted at 8, 16 and 24 hours. Northern blot analysis of total RNA (20 mg/lane ) is carried out by probing the blots with 32P-labeled BMP-7 probe. The blots are normalized for RNA loading by hybridization with 32P-labeled 18s ribosomal RNA probe. PGE2 and prostaglandin agonists induce the expression of BMP-7 in the EP2 293S cells in a time dependent manner. Such induction of expression is generally not observed in the parental cell line. Given the known role of BMP-7 in kidney regeneration and the ability of an prostaglandin agonist to induce BMP-7 expression in 293S kidney cells in a time and receptor speC1fic manner indicates a role for prostaglandin agonist in kidney regeneration.<br>
Administration of the compounds of this invention can be via any method which delivers a compound of this invention systemically and/or locally (e.g., at the site of the bone fracture, osteotomy, or orthopedic surgery). These methods include oral routes, parenteral, intraduodenal routes, etc. Generally, the compounds of this invention are administered orally, but parenteral administration (e.g., intravenous, intramuscular, transdermal, subcutaneous, rectal or intramedullary) may be utilized, for example, where oral administration is inappropriate for the target or where the patient is unable to ingest the drug.<br>
The compounds are used for the treatment and promotion of healing of bone fractures and osteotomies by the local application (e.g., to the sites of bone fractures of osteotomies) of the compounds of this invention or compositions thereof. The compounds of this invention are applied to the sites of bone fractures or osteotomies, for example, either by injection of the compound in a suitable solvent (e.g., an oily solvent such as arachis oil) to the cartilage growth plate or, in cases of open surgery, by local application thereto of such compounds in a suitable carrier or diluent such as bone-wax, demineralized bone powder, polymeric bone cements, bone sealants, etc. Alternatively, local application can be achieved by applying a solution or dispersion of the compound in a suitable carrier or diluent onto the surface of, or incorporating it into solid or semi-solid implants<br>
conventionally used in orthopedic surgery, such as dacron-mesh, gel-foam and Kiel bone, or prostheses.<br>
The compounds of this invention may also be applied locally to the site of the fracture or osteotomy in a suitable carrier or diluent in combination with one or more of the anabolic agents or bone anti-resorptive agents described above.<br>
Such combinations within the scope of this invention can be co-administered simultaneously or sequentially in any order, or a single pharmaceutical composition comprising a Formula I compound, a prodrug thereof or a pharmaceutical salt of said compound or said prodrug as described above and a second compound as described above in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent can be administered.<br>
For example, a bone anabolic agent can be used in this invention alone or in combination with an anti-resorptive agent for three months to three years, followed by an anti-resorptive agent alone for three months to three years, with optional repeat of the full treatment cycle. Alternatively, for example, the bone anabolic agent can be used alone or in combination with an anti-resorptive agent for three months to three years, followed by an anti-resorptive agent alone for the remainder of the patient's life. For example, in one preferred mode of administration, a Formula I compound, or a prodrug thereof or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of said compound or said prodrug as described above may be administered once daily and a second compound as described above (e.g., estrogen agonist/antagonist) may be administered daily in single or multiple doses. Alternatively, for example, in another preferred mode of administration the two compounds may be administered sequentially wherein the Formula I compound, prodrug thereof or pharmaceutically acceptable salt of said compound or said prodrug as described above may be administered once daily for a period of time suffiC1ent to augment bone mass to a level which is above the bone fracture threshold (World Health Organization Study "Assessment of Fracture Risk and its Application to Screening for Postmenopausal Osteoporosis (1994). Report of a World Health Organization Study Group. World Health Organization Technical Series 843") followed by administration of a second compound, as described above (e.g., estrogen agonist/antagonist), daily in single or multiple doses. It is<br>
preferred that the first compound as described above is administered once daily in a rapid delivery form such as oral delivery.<br>
In any event, the amount and timing of compounds administered will, of course, be dependent on the subject being treated, on the severity of the affliction, on the manner of administration and on the judgment of the prescribing physician. Thus, because of patient to patient variability, the dosages given below are a guideline and the physician may titrate doses of the drug to achieve the treatment (e.g., bone mass augmentation) that the physician considers appropriate for the patient. In considering the degree of treatment desired, the physician must balance a variety of factors such as bone mass starting level, age of the patient, presence of preexisting disease, as well as presence of other diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease).<br>
In general an amount of a compound of this invention is used that is sufficient to augment bone mass to a level which is above the bone fracture threshold (as detailed in the World Health Organization Study previously cited herein).<br>
In general an effective dosage for the anabolic agents used in this invention described above is in the range of 0.001 to 100 mg/kg/day, preferably 0.01 to 50 mg/kg/day.<br>
The following paragraphs provide preferred dosage ranges for various anti-resorptive agents.<br>
The amount of the anti-resorptive agent to be used is determined by its activity as a bone loss inhibiting agent. This activity is determined by means of the pharmacokinetics of an individual compound and its minimal versus maximal effective dose in inhibition of bone loss using a protocol such as described above (e.g., Estrogen Agonist/Antagonist Protocol).<br>
In general, an effective dosage for an anti-resorptive agent is about 0.001 mg/kg/day to about 20 mg/kg/day.<br>
In general, an effective dosage for progestins is about 0.1 to 10 mg per day; the preferred dose is about 0.25 to 5 mg per day.<br>
In general, an effective dosage for polyphosphonates is determined by its potency as a bone resorption inhibiting agent of standard assays.<br>
Ranges for the daily administration of some polyphosphonates are about 0.001 mg/kg/day to about 20 mg/kg/day.<br>
In general an effective dosage for the treatment of this invention, for example the bone resorption treatment of this invention, for the estrogen agonists/antagonists of this invention is in the range of 0.01 to 200 mg/kg/day, preferably 0.5 to 100 mg/kg/day.<br>

Tablets containing various excipients such as sodium citrate, calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate are employed along with various disintegrants such as starch and preferably potato or tapioca starch and certain complex silicates, together with binding agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium s tea rate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often very useful for tabletting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type are also employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules; preferred materials in this connection also include lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the compounds of this invention can be combined with various sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents, emulsifying agents and/or suspending agents, as well as such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various like combinations thereof.<br>
For purposes of parenteral administration, solutions in sesame or peanut oil or in aqueous propylene glycol can be employed, as well as sterile aqueous solutions of the corresponding water-soluble salts. Such aqueous solutions may be suitably buffered, if necessary, and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with sufficient saline or glucose. These aqueous solutions are especially suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal injection purposes. In this connection, the sterile aqueous media employed are all readily obtainable by standard techniques well-known to those skilled in the art.<br>
For purposes of transdermal (e.g..topical) administration, dilute sterile, aqueous or partially aqueous solutions (usually in about 0.1% to 5% concentration), otherwise similar to the above parenteral solutions, are prepared.<br>
Methods of preparing various pharmaceutical compositions with a certain amount of active ingredient are known, or will be apparent in light of this<br>
disclosure, to those skilled in this art. For examples of methods of preparing pharmaceutical compositions, see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences. Mack Publishing company, Easter, Pa., 15th Edition (1975).<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may contain 0.1%-95% of the compound(s) of this invention, preferably 1%-70%. In any event, the composition or Formulation to be administered will contain a quantity of a compound(s) of this invention in an amount effective to treat the disease/condition of the subject being treated, e.g., a bone disorder.<br>
Since the present invention has an aspect that relates to the augmentation and maintenance of bone mass by treatment with a combination of active ingredients which may be administered separately, the invention also relates to combining separate pharmaceutical compositions in kit form. The kit comprises two separate pharmaceutical compositions: a compound of Formula I a prodrug thereof or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of said compound or said prodrug and a second compound as described above. The kit comprises container means for containing the separate compositions such as a divided bottle or a divided foil packet, however, the separate compositions may also be contained within a single, undivided container. Typically the kit comprises directions for the administration of the separate components. The kit form is particularly advantageous when the separate components are preferably administered in different dosage forms (e.g., oral and parenteral), are administered at different dosage intervals, or when titration of the individual components of the combination is desired by the prescribing physician.<br>
An example of such a kit is a so-called blister pack. Blister packs are well known in the packaging industry and are being widely used for the packaging of pharmaceutical unit dosage forms (tablets, capsules, and the like). Blister packs generally consist of a sheet of relatively stiff material covered with a foil of a preferably transparent plastic material. During the packaging process recesses are formed in the plastic foil. The recesses have the size and shape of the tablets or capsules to be packed. Next, the tablets or capsules are placed in the recesses and the sheet of relatively stiff material is sealed against the plastic foil at the face of the foil which is opposite from the direction in which the recesses were formed. As a result, the tablets or capsules are sealed in the recesses between the plastic<br>
foil and the sheet. Preferably the strength of the sheet is such that the tablets or capsules can be removed from the blister pack by manually applying pressure on the recesses whereby an opening is formed in the sheet at the place of the recess. The tablet or capsule can then be removed via said opening.<br>
It may be desirable to provide a memory aid on the kit, e.g., in the form of numbers next to the tablets or capsules whereby the numbers correspond with the days of the regimen which the dosage form so specified should be ingested. Another example of such a memory aid is a calendar printed on the card e.g., as follows "First Week, Monday, Tuesday, ...etc.... Second Week, Monday, Tuesday,..." etc. Other variations of memory aids will be readily apparent. A "daily dose" can be a single tablet or capsule or several tablets or capsules to be taken on a given day. Also, a daily dose of a Formula I compound, a prodrug thereof or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of said compound or said prodrug can consist of one tablet or capsule while a daily dose of the second compound can consist of several tablets or capsules and vice versa. The memory aid should reflect this.<br>
In another specific embodiment of the invention, a dispenser designed to dispense the daily doses one at a time in the order of their intended use is provided. Preferably, the dispenser is equipped with a memory-aid, so as to further facilitate compliance with the regimen. An example of such a memory-aid is a mechanical counter which indicates the number of daily doses that has been dispensed. Another example of such a memory-aid is a battery-powered microchip memory coupled with a liquid crystal readout, or audible reminder signal which, for example, reads out the date that the last daily dose has been taken and/or reminds one when the next dose is to be taken.<br>
The compounds of this invention either alone or in combination with each other or other compounds generally will be administered in a convenient Formulation. The following Formulation examples only are illustrative and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>

GENERAL EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES<br>
Unless otherwise speC1fied, all reactions were performed under an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen (N2).<br>
NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian XL-300 (Varian Co., Palo Alto, California), a Bruker AM-300 spectrometer (Bruker Co., Billerica, Massachusetts) or a Varian Unity 400 at about 23°C at 300 or 400 MHz for proton and 75.4 MHz for carbon nuclei. Chemical shifts are expressed in parts per million downfield from trimethylsilane. The peak shapes are denoted as follows: s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet, q, quartet; m, multiple*; bs=broad singlet. Resonances designated as exchangeable did not appear in a separate NMR experiment where the sample was shaken with several drops of D2O in the same solvent. Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APC1) mass spectra were obtained on a Fisons Platform II Spectrometer. Chemical ionization mass spectra were obtained on a Hewlett-Packard 5989 instrument (Hewlett-Packard Co., Palo Alto, California) (ammonia ionization, PBMS). Where the intensity of chlorine or bromine-containing ions are described the expected intensity ratio was observed (approximately 3:1 for 35C1/37C1-containing ions) and 1:1 for 79Br/81Br-containing ions) and the intensity of only the lower mass ion is given.<br>
Column chromatography was performed with either Baker Silica Gel (40 urn) (J.T. Baker, Phillipsburg, N.J.) or Silica Gel 60 (EM SC1ences, Gibbstown, N.J.) in glass columns under low nitrogen pressure. Radial Chromatography was performed using a Chromatotron® (model 7924T, Harrison Research). Medium pressure chromatography was performed on a Flash 40 Biotage System (Biotage Inc, Dyax Corp., Charlottesville, Virginia). Unless otherwise speC1fied, reagents were used as obtained from commercial sources. Dimethylformamide, 2-propanol, acetonitrile, methanol, tetrahydrofuran, and dichloromethane, when used as reaction solvents, were the anhydrous grade supplied by Aldrich Chemical Company (Milwaukee, Wisconsin). The terms "concentrated" and "coevaporated"<br>
refer to removal of solvent at water aspirator pressure on a rotary evaporator with a bath temperature of less than 45°C. Reactions conducted at "0-20°C" or "0-25°C" were conducted with initial cooling of the vessel in an insulated ice bath which was allowed to warm to room temperature over several hours. The abbreviation "min" and "h" stand for "minutes" and "hours" respectively.<br><br>
