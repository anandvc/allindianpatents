3. Preamble to the Description LIQUID DETERGENT COMPOSITION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :<br><br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
603/MUMNP/2006<br><br>
GRANTED<br>
31-3-2008<br><br><br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a liquid laundry detergent<br>
 composition containing a dye material, wherein the colour of the composition is maintained during storage of the composition, particularly when stored in sunlight.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
 In liquid laundry detergent compositions, especially those for<br>
the washing of textile fabrics, it is common to include one or more soap and/or non-soap surfactant materials for assisting removal of various kinds of soil.<br>
It is also common to add one or more perfume components to liquid laundry detergent compositions so as to render such compositions as well as the fabrics treated with them an attractive smell.<br>
Nowadays, more and more detergent liquids are coloured and are sold in transparent bottles because this has proven to be appealing to the customer. Hence, the colour stability of detergent liquids has become significantly more important in recent times.<br>
EP-A-380,406 discloses a liquid laundry detergent composition containing non-soap surfactant material, coconut fatty acid soap, a perfume and a dye material. Furthermore, WO-88/03162 discloses a liquid laundry detergent composition containing non-soap surfactant material, fatty acid soap based on an oleic acid/coconut fatty acid mixture and a mixture of perfume, dye, opacifying agent and optical brightener. A rather similar type of liquid laundry detergent composition comprising non-soap surfactant, palm kernel fatty acid soap and a mixture of perfume, dye preservative and polymer is disclosed in EP-A-<br><br>
592,947. Furthermore, US-A-4,077,911 discloses a colored liquid detergent composition containing a colorant of the coal-tar type and butylated hydroxytoluene.<br>
We have now found that perfumes in combination with fatty acid soaps generally can have a negative influence on the dye present in the liquid detergent composition.  In particular, we have found that perfumes in combination with fatty acid soaps with at least some degree of unsaturation can have a significant negative effect on colour of the composition, during prolonged storage of the liquid laundry detergent composition, particularly if said composition also.contains an enzyme.<br>
In view of this, it is an object of the present invention to provide a liquid laundry detergent composition containing a fatty acid soap, a perfume composition, a dye material and an enzyme, wherein the colour of the composition is not negatively effected during prolonged storage, particularly when stored in sunlight.<br>
We have surprisingly found that this object can be achieved by adding an anti-oxidant to said liquid laundry detergent composition. In other words, we have found that a dye-containing liquid laundry detergent composition which further contains a fatty acid soap, a perfume composition and an enzyme, and wherein the characteristics of the dye do not deteriorate during storage, can be obtained when that composition further contains an antioxidant as further specified in the claims.<br>
It should be noted in this connection that the dye deterioration is not only induced by exposure of light but can also occur in the dark as well as when storing the composition at higher temperatures. Without wishing to be bound by.any theory, it is postulated that the dyes do not produce stable<br><br>
colours probably due to oxidative processes that can -at least-be reduced by the addition of an antioxidant.<br>

liquid laundry detergent composition comprising:<br>

If used, these agents typically comprise from about 0.01% to about 10% by weight of the composition, preferably from about 0.01% to about 5%, and more preferably from about 0.05% to about 2%.<br>
The invention will now be illustrated by way of the following non-limiting examples, in which all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated.<br><br><br>
Examples<br>
The following 'base'	liquid detergent composition was<br>
Coconut fatty acid	6.0<br>
NI 7EO	16.0<br>
sLES	2.0<br>
Sodium hydroxide	1.55<br>
Sodium chloride	0.7 5<br>
Propylene Glycol	3.0<br>
Phosphonate	0.75<br>
Protease enzyme	0.25<br>
Perfume	0.7 5<br>
Dye - patent blue	0.0003<br>
Preservatives	0.015<br>
water	balance to 100%<br>
wherein:<br>
sLES = sodium lauryl ether sulphate (with on arerage 3<br>
sthyleneoxide units);<br>
SI I 7E0 = C12-C13 fatty alcohol ethoxylated with an average of 7<br>
Bthyleneoxide groups;<br>
Phosphonate = diethylenetriamine penta (methvlphosphonic acid)<br>
sodium salt.<br>
Subsequently, vitamin E (tocopherol) was added to half of the ;otal amount of this 'base' liquid detergent composition, at a ;oncentration of 0.04% by weigh-.<br>
[immediately thereafter, the following colour characteristics of )oth the Abase' liquid detergent composition (without the ritamin E) and the liquid detergent composition including the<br><br><br><br>
vitamin E ingredient were determined using a Spectrophotometer CM 3720d (ex Minolta), as a colorimeter:<br>
•	the intensity or lightness of the colour (expressed as 'L' );<br>
and<br>
•	the chromaticity-coordinates 'a' and ,b' ,<br>
whereby<br>
'L',   ' a'   and 'b'   are expressed in arbitrary units;<br>
-	the scale of 'L' is from +100 (pure white) to -100 (pure black);<br>
-	a= positive value means a red colour, a= negative value means a green colour, b= positive value means a yellow colour, b= negative value means a blue colour,<br>
-	the scale of 'a' and 'b' ranges from +60 to -60, whereby at the absolute level of 60 full saturation of the colour is obtained.<br>
After an 8-hours period of time during which both liquid compositions were exposed to Xe light (power of light: 500 W/m ), these colour measurements were repeated.<br>
The following results were obtained:<br>
L	a	b<br>
89.7	-21.6	-11.0<br>
89.7	-21.5	-11.1<br>
