				<td>A METHOD OF TREATING POLYESTER FABRICS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to a method of reducing the pilling propensity and/or improve the colour clarity of polyester fabrics and/or garments, which method comprises treating the fabric with a polyester hydrolytic enzyme.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Poly(ethylene terephthalate} fibers accounts for the main part of the polyester applied by the textile industry. The fibers are produced by e.g. poly-condensation of terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol, and drawing of fibers from a melt.<br>
Because of its strength, polyester fabrics and/or garments are subject to pill formation, and possibly the most important of the cloth-finishing processes applied to polyester staple-fibre materials are those designed for control of pilling. All staple-fibre materials tend to form small balls or "pills" of entangled fibres at the cloth surface, when subjected to mild abrasion during wash and wear. If the fabric contains a substantial proportion of fibres having high resistance to flexural abrasion, the pills may be retained on the surface of the cloth in sufficient numbers to produce an unpleasant handle and appearance.<br>
There is no simple  solution to the problem of pilling. In the textile industry, polyester fibers are produced as medium- and high-tenacity filament yarns and as staple fibers of various lengths and fiber color to suit the kind of spinning machinery found in the textile trade. Staple fibers are usually drawn to give medium tenacities, but may be spun from polymers of lower average molecular weight to give improved "pilling" performance at the expense of some loss in abrasion resistance. Also, the finisher may reduce the pilling propensity of a fabric by the removal of protruding hairs from the surface of the cloth and by heat treatment to reduce the tendency of the fibres to migrate within the yarns.<br><br>
These are all solutions to the problem of pilling applied by the textile industry. Solutions to this problem that can be applied by the end user of polyester fabrics have never been suggested, and the consumer still find pilling to be a problem that is encountered when wearing polyester fabrics and garments.<br>
SlMyl?iRy OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that certain polyester hydrolytic enzymes are capable of reducing the pilling propensity of polyester fabrics and garments. In particular it has been found that a group of ethyleneglycol dibenzyl ester (BEB) and/or terephtalic acid diethyl ester (ETE) hydrolytic enzymes are capable of reducing pilling propensity of polyester fabrics and garments. Furthermore, it has been found that the treatment with ethyleneglycol dibenzyl ester (BEB) and/or terephtalic acid diethyl ester (ETE) hydrolytic enzymes is capable of colour clarification of polyester fabrics and/or garments.<br>
Accordingly, in its first aspect, the invention provides a method of reducing the pilling propensity of polyester fabrics and/or garments, which method comprises treating the fabric or garment with a terephtalic acid diethyl ester hydrolytic enzyme and/or an ethyleneglycol dibenzyl ester hydrolytic enzyme, and which method is carried out in presence of a detergent.<br>
In another aspect, the invention relates to the use of a terephtalic acid diethyl ester hydrolytic enzyme and/or an ethyleneglycol dibenzyl ester hydrolytic enzyme in a method for reducing the pilling propensity of polyester fabrics and/or garments.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention provides a method of colour clarification of polyester fabrics and/or garments, which method comprises treating the fabric or garment with a terephtalic acid diethyl ester hydrolytic enzyme and/or an ethyleneglycol dibenzyl ester hydrolytic enzyme, and which method is carried out in presence of a detergent.<br><br>
In yet another aspect, the invention relates to the use of a terephtalic acid diethyl ester hydrolytic enzyme and/or an ethyleneglycol dibenzyl ester hydrolytic enzyme in a method of colour clarification of polyester fabrics and/or garments.<br>

Polyester Hydrolytic Enzymes<br>
The method of the invention comprises treating the fabric or garment with a polyester hydrolytic enzyme. It has surprisingly been found that a certain group of enzymes are capable of hydrolysing terephtalic acid diethyl ester (ETE) and/or an ethyleneglycol dibenzyl ester (BEB), and therefore are polyesterhydrolytic enzymes.<br><br>

The surfactant is preferably formulated to be compatible with enzyme components present in the composition. In liquid or gel compositions the surfactant is most preferably formulated in such a way that it promotes, or at least does not degrade, the stability of any enzyme in these compositions.<br>
Preferred systems to be used according to the present invention comprise as a surfactant one or more of the nonionic and/or anionic surfactants described herein.<br>
Polyethylene, polypropylene, and polybutylene oxide condensates of alkyl phenols are suitable for use as the nonionic surfactant of the surfactant systems of the present invention, with the polyethylene oxide condensates being preferred. These compounds include the condensation products of alkyl phenols having an alkyl group containing from about 6 to about 14 carbon atoms, preferably from about 8 to about 14 carbon atoms, in either a straight chain or branched-chain configuration with the alkylene oxide. In a preferred embodiment, the ethylene oxide is present in an amount equal to from about 2 to about 25 moles, more preferably from about 3 to about 15 moles, of ethylene oxide per mole of alkyl phenol. Commercially available nonionic surfactants of this type include Igepal™ CO-630, marketed by the GAF Corporation; and Triton™ X-45, X-114, X-100 and X~102, all marketed by the Rohm &amp; Haas Company. These surfactants are commonly referred to as alkylphenol alkoxylates (e.g., alkyl phenol ethoxylates).<br>
The condensation products of primary and secondary aliphatic alcohols with about 1 to about 25 moles of ethylene oxide are suitable for use as the nonionic surfactant of the nonionic surfactant systems of the present invention. The alkyl chain of the aliphatic alcohol can either be straight or branched, primary or secondary, and generally contains from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms. Preferred are the condensation products of alcohols having an alkyl group containing from about<br><br>
8 to about 20 carbon atoms, more preferably from about 10 to about 18 carbon atoms, with from about 2 to about 10 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol. About 2 to about 7 moles of ethylene oxide and most preferably from 2 to 5 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol are present in said condensation pro¬ducts. Examples of commercially available nonionic surfactants of this type include Tergitol"""^ 15-S-9 (The condensation product of C11-C15 linear alcohol with 9 moles ethylene oxide), Tergitol™ 24-L-6 NMW (the condensation product of C12-C14 primary alcohol with 6 moles ethylene oxide with a narrow molecular weight distribution), both marketed by Union Carbide Corporation; Neodol"^" 45-9 (the condensation product of dj-Cis linear alcohol with 9 moles of ethylene oxide), Neodol™ 23-3 (the condensation product of C]2-Ci3 linear alcohol with 3.0 moles of ethylene oxide) , Neodol™ 45-7 (the condensation product of Ci4-Ci5 linear alcohol with 7 moles of ethylene oxide), Neodol"^" 45-5 (the condensation product of Cu-Cia linear alcohol with 5 moles of ethylene oxide) marketed by Shell Chemical Company, Kyro^" EOB (the condensation product of C13-C15 alcohol with 9 moles ethylene oxide), marketed by The Procter &amp; Gamble Company, and Genapol LA. 050 (the condensation product of CH-CIA   alcohol with 5 moles of ethylene oxide) marketed by Hoechst.

Any reducing saccharide containing 5 or 6 carbon atoms can be used, e.g., glucose, galactose and galactosyl moieties can be substituted for the glucosyl moieties (optionally the hydrophobic group is<br><br>
attached at the 2-,   3-, 4-, etc. positions thus giving a glucose or galactose as opposed to a glucoside or galactoside). The intersaccharide bonds can be, e.g., between the one position of the additional saccharide units and the 2-, 3-, 4-, and/or 6-positions on the preceding saccharide units.<br>

Cellulases: In the present context, the term "cellulase or "cellulolytic enzyme" refers to an enzyme which catalyses the degradation of cellulose to glucose, cellobiose, triose and other cellooligosaccharides. Cellulose is a polymer of glucose linked by beta-1,4-glucosidic bonds. Cellulose chains form numerous intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which result in the formation of insoluble cellulose microfibrils. Microbial hydrolysis of cellulose to glucose involves the following three ma:jor classes of cellulases; endo-1,4-beta-glucanases (EC 3.2.1.4), which cleave beta-1,4-glucosidic links randomly throughout cellulose molecules; cellobiohydrolases (EC 3.2.1.91) (exoglucanases), which digest cellulose from the nonreducing end; and beta-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.21), which hydrolyse cellobiose and low-molecular-mass cellodextrins to release glucose. Most cellulases consist of a cellulose-binding domain (CBD) and a catalytic domain (CAD) separated by a linker rich in proline and hydroxy amino acid residues. In the specification and claims, the term "endoglucanase" is intended to denote enzymes  with cellulolytic activity, especially endo-1,4-beta-glucanase activity, which are classified in EC 3.2.1.4 according to the Enzyme Nomenclature (1992) and are capable of catalysing (endo)hydrolysis of 1,4-beta-D-glucosidic linkages in cellulose, lichenin and cereal beta-D-glucans including 1,4-linkages in beta-D-glucans also containing 1,3-<br><br>
linkages. Any cellulase suitable for use in alkaline solutions can be used. Suitable cellulases include those of bacterial or fungal origin. Chemically or genetically modified mutants are included. Suitable cellulases are disclosed in US 4,435,307, which discloses fungal cellulases produced from Humicola insolens. Especially suitable cellulases are the cellulases having colour care benefits. Examples of such cellulases are cellulases described in European patent application No. 0 495 257, WO 91/17243 and WO 96/29397.<br>
Commercially available cellulases include Celluzyme™  and<br>

In general, bleaching compounds are optional added components in non-liquid formulations, e.g. granular detergents.<br>
The bleaching agent component for use herein can be any of the bleaching agents useful for detergent compositions including oxygen bleaches as well as others known in the art.<br>
The bleaching agent suitable for the present invention can be an activated or non-activated bleaching agent.<br>

thereof. Suitable examples of this class of agents include magnesium monoperoxyphthalate hexahydrate, the magnesium salt of meta-chloro perbenzoic acid, 4-nonylamino-4-oxoperoxybutyric acid and diperoxydodecanedioic acid. Such bleaching agents are disclosed in US 4,483,781, US 740,446, EP 0 133 354 and US 4,412,934. Highly preferred bleaching agents also include 6-nonylamino-6-oxoperoxycaproic acid as described in US 4,634,551.<br>

Useful bleaching agents, including peroxyacids and bleaching systems comprising bleach activators and peroxygen bleaching compounds for use in cleaning compositions  according to the invention are described in application USSN 08/136,626.<br>
The hydrogen peroxide may also be present by adding an enzymatic system (i.e. an enzyme and a substrate therefore) which is capable of generation of hydrogen peroxide at the beginning or during the washing and/or rinsing process. Such<br><br>
enzymatic systems are disclosed in European Patent Application EP 0 537 381.<br>
Bleaching agents other than oxygen bleaching agents are also known in the art and can be utilized herein. One type of non-oxygen bleaching agent of particular interest includes photoactivated bleaching agents such as the sulfonated zinc and-/or aluminium phthalocyanines. These materials can be deposited upon the substrate during the washing process. Upon irradiation with light, in the presence of oxygen, such as by hanging clothes out to dry in the daylight, the sulfonated zinc phthalocyanine is activated and, consequently, the substrate is bleached. Preferred zinc phthalocyanine and a photoactivated bleaching process are described in US 4,033,718. Typically, detergent composition will contain about 0.025% to about 1.25%, by weight, of sulfonated zinc phthalocyanine.<br>
Bleaching agents may also comprise a manganese catalyst. The manganese catalyst may, e.g., be one of the compounds described in "Efficient manganese catalysts for low-temperature bleaching". Nature 369, 1994, pp. 637-639.<br>
Suds suppressors: Another optional ingredient is a suds suppressor, exemplified by silicones, and silica-silicone mixtures. Silicones can generally be represented by alkylated polysiloxane materials, while silica is normally used in finely divided forms exemplified by silica aerogels and xerogels and hydrophobic silicas of various types.

sulfoisophthalate, ethylene glycol and 1,2-propanediol, the end groups consisting primarily of sulphobenzoate and secondarily of mono esters of ethylene glycol and/or 1,2-propanediol. The target is to obtain a polymer capped at both end by sulphobenzoate groups, "primarily", in the present context most of said copolymers herein will be endcapped by sulphobenzoate groups. However, some copolymers will be less than fully capped, and therefore their end groups may consist of monoester of ethylene glycol and/or 1,2-propanediol, thereof consist "secon¬darily" of such species.<br>
The selected polyesters herein contain about 46% by weight of dimethyl terephthalic acid, about 16% by weight of 1,2-propanediol, about 10% by weight ethylene glycol, about 13% by weight of dimethyl sulfobenzoic acid and about 15% by weight of sulfoisophthalic acid, and have a molecular weight of about 3.000. The polyesters and their method of preparation are described in detail in EP 311 342.<br><br>
Softening agents: Fabric softening agents can also be incorporated into laundry detergent compositions in accordance with the present invention. These agents may be inorganic or organic in type. Inorganic softening agents are exemplified by the smectite clays disclosed in GB-A-1 400898 and in US 5,019,292. Organic fabric softening agents include the water insoluble tertiary amines as disclosed in GB-Al 514 276 and EP 0 Oil 340 and their combination with mono C12-C14 quaternary ammo¬nium salts are disclosed in EP-B-0 026 528 and di-long-chain amides as disclosed in EP 0 242 919, Other useful organic ingredients of fabric softening systems include high molecular weight polyethylene oxide materials as disclosed in EP 0 299 575 and 0 313 146.<br>
Levels of smectite clay are normally in the range from 5% to 15%, more preferably from 8% to 12% by weight, with the material being added as a dry mixed component to the remainder of the formulation. Organic fabric softening agents such as the water-insoluble tertiary amines or dilong chain amide materials are incorporated at levels of from 0.5% to 5% by weight, normally from 1% to 3% by weight whilst the high molecular weight polyethylene oxide materials and the water soluble cationic materials are added at levels of from 0.1% to 2%, normally from 0.15% to 1.5% by weight. These materials are normally added to the spray dried portion of the composition, although in some instances it may be more convenient to add them as a dry mixed particulate, or spray them as molten liquid on to other solid components of the composition. Polymeric dye-transfer inhibiting agents: The detergent compositions according to the present invention may also comprise from 0.001% to 10%, preferably from 0.01% to 2%, more preferably form 0.05% to 1% by weight of polymeric dye- transfer inhibiting agents. Said polymeric dye-transfer inhibiting agents are normally incorporated into detergent compositions in order to inhibit the transfer of dyes from colored fabrics onto fabrics washed therewith. These polymers have the ability of<br><br>
complexing or adsorbing the fugitive dyes washed out of dyed fabrics before the dyes have the opportunity to become attached to other articles in the wash.<br>
Especially suitable polymeric dye-transfer inhibiting agents are polyaraine N-oxide polymers, copolymers of N-vinyl-pyrrolidone and N-vinylimidazole, polyvinylpyrrolidone polymers, polyvinyloxazolidones and polyvinylimidazoles or mixtures thereof.<br>
Addition of such polymers also enhances the performance of the enzymes according the invention.<br>
The detergent cottiposition according to the invention can be in liquid, paste, gels, bars or granular forms.<br>
Non-dusting granulates may be produced, e.g., as disclosed in US 4,106,991 and 4,661,452 (both to Novo Industri A/S) and may optionally be coated by methods known in the art. Examples of waxy coating materials are poly(ethylene oxide) products (polyethyleneglycol, PEG} with mean molecular weights of 1000 to 20000; ethoxylated nonylphenols having from 16 to 50 ethylene oxide units; ethoxylated fatty alcohols in which the alcohol contains from 12 to 20 carbon atoms and in which there are 15 to 80 ethylene oxide units; fatty alcohols; fatty acids; and mono-and di- and triglycerides of fatty acids. Examples of film-forming coating materials suitable for application by fluid bed techniques are given in GB 1483591.<br>
Granular compositions according to the present invention can also be in "compact form", i.e. they may have a relatively higher density than conventional granular detergents, i.e. form 550 to 950 g/1; in such case, the granular detergent compositions according to the present invention will contain a lower amount of "Inorganic filler salt", compared to conventional granular detergents; typical filler salts are alkaline earth metal salts of sulphates and chlorides, typically sodium sulphate; "Compact" detergent typically comprise not more than 10% filler salt. The liquid compositions according to the present invention can also be in "concentrated form", in such<br><br>
case, the liquid detergent compositions according to the present invention will contain a lower amount of water, compared to con¬ventional liquid detergents. Typically, the water content of the concentrated liquid detergent is less than 30%, more preferably less than 20%, most preferably less than 10% by weight of the detergent compositions.<br>
The compositions of the invention may for example, be formulated as hand and machine laundry detergent compositions including laundry additive compositions and compositions suitable for use in the pretreatment of stained fabrics, rinse added fabric softener compositions, and compositions for use in general household hard surface cleaning operations and dishwashing operations.<br>

Improvements in pilling resistance may be determined using the Martindale pilling tester (Swiss standard SN 198525) .<br>
In Example 2, below, a method of determining the reduction of the pilling propensity of polyester fabrics and garments is described.<br>
Additional Benefits from the Method of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to the use of a ETE hydrolytlc enzyme and/or a BEB hydrolytic enzyme for reducing the pilling propensity, and find use in a the method of reducing the pilling propensity of polyester fabrics or garments.<br><br>
However,    from   experiiuyxiLS   WJ.L,II   uae   uj.   a   cji-Lj   liyu-i-uj-y L-xi^<br>
enzyme and/or a BEB hydrolytic enzyme for reducing the pilling propensity, it has also been found that the method of the present invention allow for improvements in colour clarification. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment, the method of the invention may be carried out simultaneously with conventional colour clarification processes. Colour clarification processes have been described in e.g. EP 220,016; WO 91/17243; WO 89/09259; WO 91/19307; WO 94/07998 and WO 96/29397. In particular, the method of the invention may be carried out simultaneously with a laundry process and in the presence of a cellulytic enzyme.<br>
The term "colour clarification", as used herein, refers to preservation of the initial colours throughout multiple washing cycles by removing fuzz and pills from the surface of garment and/or fabric. The colour clarification ability may be determined by measuring the reflectance of the textile. These data are used to calculate the colour difference by use of the Hunter equation, as described in Example 3, below.<br>
Also the method of the invention allow for improved soil release properties, in particular of oily stains, probably due to increased hydrophilicity of the polyester fibers.<br>
Finally, the method of the invention was found to improve the antistatic properties of polyester fabrics and/or garments.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The invention is further illustrated with reference to the following examples which are not intended to be in any way limiting to the scope of the invention as claimed.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Hydrolytic Activity<br>
This example described an assay for determining the terephtalic acid diethyl ester (ETE) and/or an ethyleneglycol dibenzyl ester {BEB) hydrolytic activity of an enzyme.<br>
ETE Hydrolytic Activity<br>
An ETE hydrolytic enzyme of the invention is an enzyme capable of hydrolyzing terephtalic acid diethyl ester (ETE), as determined by the following assay.<br>
In a test tube, 0.250 ml of 0.20 M glycylglycine pH 8.5, and 0.250 ml of 10.0 mM terephthalic acid diethyl ester (ETE) in 1,4-dioxane, is added to 2.000 ml of de-ionized water.<br>
The mixture is pre-incubated under stirring at 30°C for approximately 15 minutes, followed by the addition of 25.0 fxg of enzyme in the lowest possible volume.<br>
This mixture is then subjected to incubation under stirring at 30°C for 16 hours.<br>
The reaction mixture is analyzed on a reverse phase HPLC, 0D3 (octa dodecyl silicate) column, and eluted with increasing concentration of acetonitrile and decreasing concentration of 200 mM Napo^, pH 3.0.<br>
Detection of the reaction products is carried out spectrophotometrically at 240 nm, at which wavelength terephtalic acid and terephtalate derivatives adsorb.<br>
BEB Hydrolytic Activity<br>
An BEB hydrolytic enzyme of the invention is an enzyme capable of hydrolyzing ethyleneglycol dibenzyl ester (BEB). Dependent on the amount of dioxane present in the assay (BEB is only partially dissolved in a 10% dioxane solution, but fully dissolved in a 30% dioxane solution), the BEB hydrolytic enzyme of the invention may be a BEB^° hydrolytic enzyme or a BEB^"" hydrolytic enzyme, as determined by the following assays.<br><br>
BEB^° Hydrolytic Activity<br>
In  a test tube, 0.250 ml of 0.20 M glycylglycine pH 8.5, and 0.250 ml of 10.0 mM ethyleneglycol dibenzyl ester (BEB) in 1,4-dioxane, is added to 2.000 ml of de-ionized water.<br>
The mixture is pre-incubated under stirring at 30°C for approximately 15 minutes, followed by the addition of 25.0 \xg  of enzyme in the lowest possible volume.<br>
This mixture is then subjected to incubation under<br>
stirring at 30°C for 16 hours.<br>
The reaction mixture is analyzed on a reverse phase HPLC, ODS (octa dodecyl silicate) column, and eluted with increasing concentration of acetonitrile and decreasing concentration of 200 mM NaPO^, pH 3.0.<br>
Detection of the reaction products is carried out spectrophotometrically at 240 nm, at which wavelength terephtalic acid and terephtalate derivatives adsorb.<br>
BEB^"^ Hydrolytic Activity<br>
In  a test tube, 0.250 ml of 0.20 M glycylglycine pH 8.5, 0.250 ml of 10.0 mM ethyleneglycol dibenzyl ester (BEB) in 1,4-dioxane, and 0.500 ml of 1,4-dioxane, is added to 1.500 ml of de-ionized water.<br>
The mixture is pre-incubated under stirring at 30""C for approximately 15 minutes, followed by the addition of 25.0 |ag of enzyme in the lowest possible volume.<br>
This mixture is then subjected to incubation under<br>
stirring at 30°C for 16 hours.<br>
The reaction mixture is analyzed on a reverse phase HPLC, ODS (octa dodecyl silicate) column, and eluted with increasing concentration of acetonitrile and decreasing concentration of 200 mM NaP04, pH 3.0.<br><br>
r<br>
Detection of the reaction products is carried out spectrophotometrically at 240 run, at which wavelength terephtalic acid and terephtalate derivatives adsorb.<br>
Microbial Sources<br>
A number of enzymes from different microbial sources were subjected to the assay for determining BEB and ETE hydrolytic activity, and the results obtained are presented in Table 1, below:<br><br>
1)	Humicola insolens  cutinase (actually a lipase also having<br>
cutinase activity) obtained from the strain DSM 1800 as<br>
described in Example 2 of US 4,810,414.<br>
2)	Candida  antarctica  Component B obtained as described in Example 10 of WO 88/02775.<br>
3)	Pseudomonas  cepacia  obtained as described in EP 331,37 6.<br>
4)	Candida  cylindracea   (syn. Candida rugosa)   lipase obtained from<br>
Nippon Oil &amp; Fats Co. Ltd., Japan).<br>
5)	Glucosaminated Lipolase™ obtained as described in Example 7A<br>
of WO 95/09909.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Reduced Pilling Propensities<br>
This example describes an assay for determining the reduction of pilling propensity of polyester fabrics and garments.<br>
200 ml Britton-Robinson buffer pH 7.5 added 0.2 g/1 Lutensol T05 (BASF)  is added to each Launder-0-meter beaker including 5 steel balls. The beakers are equilibrated at SC^C. Two knitted polyester/cotton (50/50%) swatches (approx. 14x14 cm each} are added to each Launder-0-meter beaker. Enzyme (Humicola insolens cutinase) is added at different dosages (0.01%-0.2% on weight of fabric) including a blank without enzyme.  The swatches are incubated 2 hours at SO^C in the Launder-0-meter. After incubation the swatches are given a short rinse in a household laundry machine and tumble dried.<br>
The cycle of incubation and rinsing/drying is repeated once or until the swatches differs in respect to pilling propensity.<br>
Improvement in pilling resistance is measured using the Martindale pilling tester (Swiss standard SN 198525). An improvement is considered significant if the pilling grade is improved more than half a grade.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Colour Clarification<br>
This example describes an assay for determining the colour clarification ability on polyester fabrics.<br>
A dyed polyester/cotton fabric that has been pre-washed e.g. 10 times in a household laundry machine in order to obtain a matted and pilled appearance of the fabric surface is used as a test swatch.<br>
150 ml Britton-Robinson buffer pH 7.5 added 0.2 g/1 Lutensol T05 (BASF) is added to each Launder-0-meter beaker including 5 steel balls. The beakers are equilibrated at 50°C. Two knitted pre-washed polyester/cotton (50/50%) swatches<br><br>
(approx. 10x10 cm each) are added to each Launder-0-meter beaker. Enzyme (Humicola insQlens cutinase) is added at different dosages {0.01%-0.2% on weight of fabric) including a blank without enzyme. The swatches are incubated 2 hours at 50°C in the Launder-0-meter. After incubation the swatches are given a short rinse in  a household laundry machine and tumble dried. The cycle of incubation and rinsing/drying is repeated once or until the swatches clearly differed in respect to color (fuzz) on the swatches.<br>
Finally, the swatches are graded visually against the blank (no enzyme) and the colour difference are measured using a reflectance spectrophotometer. The colour clarification ability of the enzyme can be  detected by measuring the colour difference between the enzyme treated swatch and the blank. The Hunter L co-ordinate, among others (e.g. CIE Lab L*) may be used for this purpose (AATCC Test Method 153-1985 "Color Measurements of Textiles: Instrumental")<br><br><br>
