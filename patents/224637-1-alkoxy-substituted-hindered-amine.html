The instant invention pertains to hindered amine compounds which are substituted on the N-atom by N-alkoxy moieties containing one to three hydroxyl groups. These materials are particularly effective in stabilizing potyolefins, especially thermoplastic polyotefins, against the deleterious effects of oxidative, thermal and actinic radiation. The compounds are also effective in stabilizing acid catalyzed and ambient cured coatings systems.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
4-Hydroxy-1-oxy(-2,2,6,6-tetram6thylpiperidi"ne and 4-OXO-1-oxy(-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidine are reported to have been used to trap carbon centered radicals formed from methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and sec-butanol by S. Nigam et al., J. Chem. Soc., Trans. Faraday Soc. 1, 1976. 72, 2324 and by K.-D. Asmus et al., Int. J. Radiat. Biol., 1976, 29, 211.<br>
United States PatenUslo^5,627Â£48 and European Patent Application No. 135,280 A2 describe, respectively, difunctional and monofunotional living free radical polymerization initiators, some of which contain hindered amine ethers substituted by hydroxy groups. These compounds differ substantially in structure and performance from the instant compounds.<br>
European Patent Application No. 427,672 Aland United States Patent No. 4,972,009 mention, but do not exemplify, respectively, hydroxylamine and nitrone structures, some of which contain CrC4 hydroxyalkoxy substituted 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine derivatives. Such structures are outside the scope of the instant invention.<br>
United States Patent No. 5,204,473 describes N-hydrocarbyloxy hindered amine derivatives that are prepared exclusively from organic compounds containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms. Such compounds are structurally quite different from the instant compounds.<br>
United States Patent No. 5,004,770 describes hindered amine compounds which are substituted on the N-atom by alkoxy moieties which alkoxy groups are themselves<br><br>
unsubstituted. These compounds are especially useful in polymers including polybutadiene, polystyrene, ABS, polyacetal, polyamide, polyester, polyurethane and polycarbonate.<br>
United States Patent No. 5,096,950 also describes hindered amine compounds which are substituted on the N-atom by alkoxy moieties which alkoxy groups are themselves unsubstituted. These compounds are found to be useful in polyolefins.<br>
The instant compounds are N-alkoxy substituted derivatives of 2,2,6,6-tetraaJkyl-piperidines where the alkoxy group is substituted by one to three hydroxy moieties. The instant compounds also comprise N-alkoxy bridged derivatives of the 2,2,6,6-tetraalkylpiperidines where the alkoxy moiety, which is substituted by one to three hydroxy groups, is shared by two hindered amine molecules. The free hydroxy moieties of these compounds may be reacted with carboxylic acids, acid chlorides or esters to form simple esters or polyesters, or with isocyanates to form urethanes or polyurethanes.<br>
The instant compounds, because of their low bascity which is shared by the simple unsubstituted N-alkoxy compounds cited in the two patents mentioned above, are of particular value in the stabilization of polyolefins and automotive coating compositions where the activity of the more basic hindered amine stabilizes is significantly reduced because of interaction with the polymer substrate or acid catalytic system needed for curing such substrate.<br>
examples of polyolefin compositions in which the instant compounds are effective include flame retardant polyolefins where acidic residues from the decomposition of the halogenated flame retardants deactivate hindered amines not having the N-OR group, greenhouse films and agricultural mulch films where acidic residues from pesticides interfere with the activity of "normal" hindered amine stabilizers, and in thermoplastic polyolefins where pigment interactions with basic hindered amine stabilizers interfere with painting the substrate surfaces. Examples of coating compositions in which the instant compounds are effective include melamine crosslinked thermoset acrylic resins, which are cured using strong acids that interact with basic hindered amine stabilizers. The instant compounds are also effective in acrylic alkyd or polyester resins with isocyanate crosslinking agents, and in epoxy resins with carboxylic acid, anhydride, or amine crosslinking agents.<br><br>
Thus, current compounds are advantageously used in compositions also containing costabilizers, flame retardants (e.g. tris(3-bromo-2,2-bis(bromomethyl)propyI)phosphate, decabromodiphenyl oxide, ethylene bis-(tetrabromophthalimide), or ethylene bis-(dibromo-norbornanedicarboximide)), catalysts (e.g. acids like toluene sulfonic acid, metal driers or amines), fillers, or in agricultural applications wherein pesticides come in contact with the stabilized polymer. Preferred is a composition wherein component (a) is polypropylene, polyethylene, thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO), ABS or high impact polystyrene (HIPS), and component (b) is an effective synergistic mixture of<br>
(i) a compound of formula (1) to (30); and<br>
(ii) a flame retardant selected from the group consisting of the halogenated, phosphorus, boron, silicon and antimony compounds, metal hydroxides, metal hydrates, metal oxides and mixtures thereof.<br>
While the unsubstituted N-OR compounds described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,004,770 and 5,096,950jaiso perform well in the compositions described in the paragraph above, the instant compounds differ significantly in both structure and in performance from the prior art compounds by virtue of the presence of the one to three free hydroxy groups present on the N-alkoxy moiety. These hydroxyl groups in the instant compounds provide said compounds with superior antistatic properties, compatibility in more polar environments such as polyurethane based and in water-borne automotive coating systems, and in stabilizing painted automotive thermoplastic olefin structures.<br>
The instant compounds are particularly suited for<br>
(a)	providing superior compatibility in polycarbonates and polycarbonate/ABS blends compared to the N-OE prior art compounds; and<br>
(b)	providing superior compatibility in polyesters and polyamides compared to the prior art N-OE compounds.<br>

or by the two-coat method. In the latter method, the pigment-containing base coat is applied first and then a covering coat of clear lacquer over it.<br>
Although major emphasis in this application is directed to acid-catalyzed baked finishes, it is also to be noted that the compounds of the present invention are applicable for use in non-acid catalyzed thermoset resins such as epoxy, epoxy-polyester, vinyl, alkyd, acrylic and polyester resins, optionally modified with silicon, isocyanates or isocyanurates. The epoxy and epoxy-polyester resins are crosslinked with conventional crosslinkers such as acids, acid anhydrides, amines and the like. Correspondingly, the epoxide may be utilized as the crosslinking agent for various acrylic or polyester resin systems that have been modified by the presence of reactive groups on the backbone structure.<br>
The amount of instant stabilizer compound used is 0.1 to 5% by weight, based on the solvent-free binder, preferably 0.5 to 2% by weight. The binders can be dissolved or dispersed in customary organic solvents or in water or can be solvent-free.<br>
When used in two-coat finishes, the compounds of the instant invention can be incorporated in the clear coat or both in the clear coat and in the pigmented base coat.<br>
To attain maximum light stability, the concurrent use of other conventional light stabilizers can be advantageous. Examples are UV absorbers of the benzophenone, benzotriazole, acrylic acid derivatives, oxalanilide, aryl-s-triazine or metal-containing types (e.g. organic nickel compounds). In two-coat systems, these additional light stabilizers can be added to the clear coat and/or the pigmented base coat.<br>
If such combinations of stabilizers are used, the sum of all light stabilizers is 0.2 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.5 to 5% by weight, based on the film-forming resin.<br>
When water-soluble, water miscible or water dispersible coating are desired ammonium salts of acid groups present in the resin are formed. Powder coating composition can be prepared by reacting glycidyf methacryiate with selected alcohol components.<br><br>
It is also contemplated that the instant compounds would find particular value when used with water-soluble inks and related polar oriented utilities where the presence of the OH moiety would provide for better compatibility and properties related to such aqueous environments.<br>
The instant compounds are also useful in the stabilization of acid catalyzed thermoset resins which are disclosed in United States Patent No. 5,112,890, the relevant parts of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
These resins are used in baked enamels orstoving lacquers. Hindered amine light stabilizaers are well known to be effective in stabilizing a host of organic substrates including polymers from the deleterious effects of oxygen and light. Such hindered amine light stabilizers have been used in the stabilization of hot-crosslinkable alkyd or acrylic metallic stoving lacquers (see U.S. Patent No. 4,426,472) and in stabilizing acid-catalyzed stoving lacquers based on hot-crosslinkable acrylic polyester or alkyl resins (see U.S. Patent Nos. 4,344,876 and 4,426,471). None of the hindered amine light stabilizers of these patents possess structures having an O-substituted hydroxyl group substituted directly on the N-atom of the hindered amine. The instant compounds have such substitution and additionally are even less basic than the NOR compounds described in U.S. Patent No. 5,112,890 as is seen in instant working Example 114.<br>
In their industrial uses, enamels with high solids content based on crosslinkable acrylic, polyester, urethane or alkyd resins are cured with an additional acid catalyst. Light stabilizers containing a basic nitrogen group are generally less than satisfactory in this application. Formation of a salt between the acid catalyst and the light stabilizer leads to incompatibility or insolubility and recipitation of the salt and to a reduced level of cure and to reduced light protective action and poor resistance to moisture.<br>
The acid catalyzed thermoset enamels must be stabilized in order to function acceptably in end-use applications. The stabilizers used are hindered amines, preferably those substituted on the N-atom by an inert blocking group in order to prevent precipitation of the basic amine with the acid catalyst with a concomitant retardation in cure, optionally in combination with UV absorbers as described above.<br><br>
The stabilizers are needed to impart greater retention of durability (o the cured enamels (as measured by 20Â° gfoss, distinction of image, cracking or chalking); the stabilizers must not retard cure (normal bake for auto finishes at 121Â°C; and low bake repair at 82Â°C) as measured by hardness, adhesion, solvent resistance and humidity resistance; the enamel should not yellow on curing and further color change on exposure to light should be minimized; the stabilizers should be soluble in the organic solvents normally used in coating applications, such as methyl amyl ketone, xylene, n-hexyl acetate, alcohol and the like.<br>
The instant hindered amine light stabilizers on the N-atom by an O-substituted moiety containing a free hydroxyl group fulfill each of these requirements and provide alone or in combination with a UV absorber outstanding light stabilization protection to the cured acid<br>
catalyzed thermoset enamels.<br>
The instant invention also pertains to resin systems capable of being fully cured under ambient conditions. For example, applicable resins include alkyd, acrylic, polyester and epoxide resins as described in S. Paul's "Surface Coatings: Science and Technology" (1985), pages 70-310. Various acrylic and modified acrylic resins are described in H. Kittel's "Lehrbuch der Lacke unde Beschichtungen", Vol. 1, Part 2, on pages 735 and 742 (Berlin 1972), and in "Lack-kunstharze" (1977) by H. Wagner and H. F. Sarx, op. cit, on pages 229-238. Typical crosslinkable polyester resins which can be stabilized against the action of light and moisture are described e.g. in H. Wagner and H. F. Sarx, op. cit., on pages 86-99. The unmodified and modified alkyd resins which can be stabilized are conventional resins which are used in trade sales, maintenance and automotive refinish coatings. For example, such coatings are. based on alkyd resins, alkyd/acrylic resins and alkyd/silicon reins (see H. Wagner and H. F. Sarx, op. cit., pages 99-123) optionally crosslinked by isocyanates or epoxy resins.<br>
In addition various acrylic lacquer coating compositions are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,162,249. Other acrylic/alkyd resins with polyisocyanate additives are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,471,083; and acrylic resins containing either pendant amino ester groups or glycidyl groups are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,525,521.<br>
The ambient cured coatings stabilized by the instant compounds are suitable both for metal finish coatings and solid shade finishes, especially in the case of retouching finishes. The<br><br>
lacquers stabilized by the instant compounds are preferably applied in a conventional manner by two methods, either by the single-coat method or by the two-coat method. In the latter method, the pigment-containing base coat is applied first and a covering coat of clear lacquer applied over it. When used in two-coat finishes, the instant hindered amine compound can be incorporated in the clear coat or both in the clear coat and in the pigmented base coat.<br>
The instant invention also pertains to abrasion-resistant coating compositions suitable for coating over polycarbonates. Such coatings as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,214,085 comprise a silyl acrylate, aqueous colloidal silica, a photoinitiator and optionally a polyfunctional acryiate as well as UV absorbers. Such coatings provide resistance after prolonged outdoor exposure to sunlight, moisture, thermal cycling causing yellowing, delamination and formation of microcracks and decreasing transparency.<br>
Related hindered amine stabilizers have been utilized individually and in combination with UV absorbers to improve the performance characteristics of ambient cured coating systems. Notwithstanding such improvements, there still exists a need to further retard the photooxidation and photodegradation of such ambient cured systems and thereby provide increased effectiveness by maintaining the physical integrity of the coatings. Such effectiveness can be manifested by prevention of embrittlement, cracking, corrosion, erosion, loss of gloss, chalking and yellowing of the coating.<br>
It has now been determined that the aforementioned improvements canbe achieved by substitution of the N-atom of the hindered amines with an -OR moiety and by the utilization of such derivatives in ambient cured coating systems as is taught in United States Patent No. 5,124,378, the relevant parts of which are incorporated herein by reference. The instant compounds are even less basic than the compounds of U.S. 5,124,378 and are particularly well suited for this task. In particular, the physical integrity of the coatings is maintained to a higher degree with significant reduction in loss of gloss and in yellowing. Accordingly, the instant invention relates to the use of the instant NOR compounds, where the R moiety is further substituted by a hydroxyl group, optionally together with further stabilizers, for stabilizing ambient cured coatings based on alkyd resins; thermoset acrylic resins; acrytic alkyds; acrylic alkyd or polyester resins optionally modified with silicon, isocyanates, isocyanurates, ketimines or oxazolidines; and epoxide resins crosslinked with carboxylic acids, anhydrides, polyamines<br><br>
or mercaptans; and acrylic and polyester resin systems modified with reactive groups in the backbone thereof and crosslinked with epoxides; against the degradative effects of light, moisture and oxygen.<br>
The instant invention also relates to electrodeposited coatings applied to metal substrates where various top coats may be applied thereover. The inclusion of the instant compounds in the E-coat provides delamination resistance to said E-coats. The primary resins in said E-coats are acrylic or epoxy resins. These E-coats are described in European patent application EP 0 576 943 A1.<br>
The instant invention also pertains to UV-cured coating systems using unsaturated acrylic resins, polyurethane acrylates, epoxy acrylates, polyester acrylates, unsaturated polyester/styrene resins and silyl acrylates.<br>
Powder Coatings<br>
The instant invention also pertains to powder coating formulations which require resistance to photodegradation. Resin systems which would be applicable include glycidal methacrylate or acrylate-functional acrylic or acrylic hybrids, crosslinked with diacids or anhydrides; acid or anhydride functional acrylic or polyester resins crosslinked with TGIC; hydroxy! functional acrylic or polyester resins crosslinked with isocyanates. The stabilized coating may be a single layer applied to a substrate, or may be a clearcoat applied over a waterborne or solvent-borne basecoat.<br>
The stabilized coating may also contain a UV absorber, consisting of one of the<br>
aforementioned compounds.<br>
Radiation-Cured Systems<br>
The instant invention also pertains to radiation-cured coating systems. These systems would consist of:<br>
a.	Ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable comopounds<br>
b.	At least one photoinitiator<br><br>
c. One or more of the instant stabilizing compounds<br>
The coating composition may also include a UV absorbing stabilizer, represented by one of the classes mentioned..<br>
The coating may also include pigments or other colorants designed to provide opacity or aesthetic properties.<br>

The polyols may be esterified partially or completely with one or with different unsaturated carboxylic acids, in which case the free hydroxyl groups of the partial esters may be modified, for example etherified, or esterified with other carboxylic acids.<br>
Illustrative examples of esters are: Trimethylolpropane triacrylate, trimethylolethane triacrylate, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, trimethylolethane trimethacrylate, tetramethylene glycol dimethacrylate, triethylene glycol dime triacrylate, tetraethylene glycol diacrylate,<br>

Polyfunctional monomers and oligomers are available for example from UCB Chemicals, Smyrna, Georgia, and Sartomer, Exton, Pennsylvania.<br>
Suitable ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable compounds are also the amides of identical or different unsaturated carboxylic acids of aromatic, cycloaliphatic and aliphatic polyamines containing preferably 2 to 6, more particularly 2 to 4, amino groups. Exemplary of such polyamines are ethylenediamine, 1,2-or 1,3-propylenediamine, 1,2-, 1,3-or1,4-butylenediamine, 1,5-pentylenediamine, 1,6-hexylenediamine, octylenediamine, dodecylenediamine, 1,4-diaminocyclohexane, isophoronediamine, phenylenediamine, bisphenylenediamine, bis(fi-aminoethyl) ether, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, bis(P-aminoethoxy)ethane or bis(P-aminopropoxy)ethane. Other suitable polyamines are polymers and copolymers which may contain additional amino groups in the side-chain and oligoamides containing amino end groups.<br>
Exemplary of such unsaturated amides are: Methylenebisacrylamide, 1,6-hexamethylenebisacrylamide, diethylenetriaminetrismethacrylamide, bis(methacrylamidopropoxy)ethane, p-methacrylamidoethylmethacrylate, N-[(p-hydroxyethoxy)ethyl]acrylamide.<br>
Suitable unsaturated polyesters and polyamides are derived typically from maleic acid and diols or diamines. Maleic acid can be partially replaced by other dicarboxylic acids such as<br><br>
fumaric acid, itaconic acid, citraconic acid, mesaconic acid or chloromaleic acid. To control the reactivity of the polyester and to influence the crosslinking density and hence the product properties, it is possible to use in addition to the unsaturated dicarboxylic acids different amounts of saturated dicarboxylic acids such as phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid, succinic acid or adipic acid. The unsaturated polyesters can be used together with ethylenically unsaturated comonomers such as styrene. The polyesters and polyamides can also be derived from dicarboxylic acids and ethylenically unsaturated diols or diamines, especially from those with long chains containing typically from 6 to 20 carbon atoms. Polyurethanes are typically those derived from saturated or unsaturated diisocyanates and unsaturated and saturated diols.<br>
Suitable polyester acrylates or acrylated polyesters are obtained by reacting oligomers, typically epoxides, urethanes, polyethers or polyesters, with acrylates such as hydroxyethyl acrylate or hydroxypropyl acrylate.<br>
Polybutadiene and polyisoprene and copolymers thereof are known. Suitable comonomers include olefins such as ethylene, propene, butene, hexene, (meth)acrylates, acrylonitrile, styrene or vinyl chloride. Polymers containing (meth)acrylate groups in the side-chain are also known. They may typically be reaction products of epoxy resins based on novolak with (meth)acrylic acid, homo- or copolymers of polyvinyl alcohol or their hydroxyalkyl derivatives which are esterified with (meth)acrylic acid or homo- and copolymers of (meth)acrylates which are esterified with hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylates.<br>
Preferred monomers are typically alkyl- or hydroxyalkyl acrylates or methacrylates, styrene, ethylene glycol diacrylate, propylene glycol diacrylate, neopentyl glycol diacrylate, hexamethylene glycol diacrylate or bisphenol A diacrylate, 4,4'-bis{2-<br>
acryloyloxyethoxy)diphenylpropane, trimethylol propane triacrylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate or tetraacrylate, preferably acrylates, styrene, hexamethylene glycol or bisphenol A diacrylate, 4,4'-bis(2-acryloyloxyethoxy)diphenylpropane or trimethylolpropane triacrylate.<br>
Particularly preferred (oligomeric) polyunsaturated compounds are polyester acrylates or unsaturated polyester resins which are prepared from maleic acid, fumaric acid, phthalic acid<br><br>
and one or more than one diof, and which typically have molecular weights from about 500 to 3000.<br>
Preferred unsaturated carboxylic acids are acrylic acid and methacrylic acid.<br>
The photopolymerizable compounds are used by themselves or in any desired mixtures. It is preferred to use mixtures of polyol(meth)acrylates.<br>
Binders may also be added to the unsaturated photopolymerizable compounds. The addition of binders is particularly useful if the photopolymerizable compounds are liquid or viscous substances. The amount of binder may be from 5-95, preferably 10-90 and, most preferably, 40-90, percent by weight, based on the entire composition. The choice of binder will depend on the field of use and the desired properties therefore, such as the ability of the compositions to be developed in aqueous and organic solvent systems, adhesion to substrates and susceptibility to oxygen.<br>
Suitable binders are typically polymers having a molecular weight of about 5,000 to 2,000,000, preferably 10,000 to 1,000,000. Illustrative examples are: Homo- and copolymers of acrylates and methacrylates, including copolymers of methyl methacrylate/ethyl acrylate/methacrylic acid, poly(alkylmethacrylates), poly (alky lacrylates); cellulose esters and ethers such as cellulose acetate, cellulose acetobutyrate, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose; polyvinyl butyral, polyvinyl formal, cyclized rubber, polyethers such as polyethylene oxide, polypropylene oxide, polytetrahydrofuran; polystyrene, polycarbonate, polyurethane, chlorinated polyolefins, polyvinyl chloride, copolymers of vinyl chloride/vinylidene chloride, copolymers of vinylidene chloride with acrylonitrile, methyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate, polyvinyl acetate, copoly(ethylene/vinyl acetate), polymers such as polycaprolactam and poly(hexamethylene adipamide), polyesters such as polyethylene glycol terephthalate) and poly(hexamethylene glycol succinate).<br>
The unsaturated compounds can also be used in admixture with non-photopotymerizable film-forming components. These components may be physically drying polymers or solutions thereof in organic solvents, for example nitrocellulose or cellulose acetobutyrate. The photopolymerizable unsaturated monomers may be a component of a free radical-ionic curable<br><br>
blend, such as a free radical-cationic curable blend. Also of importance are systems that undergo both thermal and photo-induced curing cycles, such as are used in powder coatings, laminates, certain adhesives and conformal coatings.<br>
Mixtures of a prepolymer with polyunsaturated monomers which, additionally contain a further unsaturated monomer are frequently used in paint systems. The prepolymer in this instance primarily determines the properties of the paint film and, by varying it, the skilled person can influence the properties of the cured film. The polyunsaturated monomer acts as crosslinking agent that renders the paint film insoluble. The mono-unsaturated monomer acts as reactive diluent with the aid of which the viscosity is lowered without having to use a solvent. Moreover, properties of the cured composition such as curing rate, crosslinking density and surface properties are dependent on the choice of monomer.<br>
Unsaturated polyester resins are usually used in two-component systems, together with a mono-unsaturated monomer, preferably with styrene.<br>
Binary electron-rich/electron-poor monomer systems are often employed in thick pigmented coatings. For example, vinyl ether/unsaturated polyester systems are employed in powder coatings and styrene/unsaturated polyester systems are used in gel coats.<br>
A preferred process is that wherein the ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable compounds are a mixture of (i) at least one oligomeric compound and (ii) at least one monomer.<br>
An interesting process is that wherein the ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable compounds are a mixture of (i) unsaturated polyesters, especially those that are prepared from maleic acid, fumaric acid and/or phthalic acid and one or more than one diol, and which have molecular weights of 500 to 3,000, and (ii) acrylates, methacrylates or styrene or combinations thereof.<br>
An important process is also that wherein the ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable compounds are a mixture of (i) unsaturated polyesters and (ii) acrylates or methacrylates or combinations thereof.<br><br>
Another interesting process is that wherein the ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable compounds are a mixture of (i) unsaturated polyester acrylates and (ii) acrylates or methacrylates or combinations thereof.<br>
Synthesis of Compounds<br>
The instant compounds may be prepared by the reaction of tributyltin hydride and a halogen substituted alcohol to produce carbon centered radicals that are trapped by nitroxyl<br>
compounds.<br>
The instant compounds may also be prepared by coupling an N-oxyl hindered amine with a carbon centered radical generated by the photochemical or thermal decomposition of a perester or dialkyl peroxide in the presence of an alcohol. The bridge compounds described above can be formed when two nitroxyl radicals couple with the same solvent molecule, especially when the amount of solvent is reduced.<br>
The preferred method of preparation of the instant compounds is to react an N&gt;oxyl hindered amine with a carbon centered radical generated by mixing an aqueous or alcoholic solution of a metal ion such as Fe2+, Fe3\ Cu2+ or Cu* and a peroxide such as tert-butyl hydroperoxide or hydrogen peroxide in the presence of an alcohol solvent at a temperature of 20-80Â°C. Especially effective is the combination of ferrous chloride, ferric chloride or ferrous sulfate, particularly ferrous chloride, or ferric chloride, and hydrogen peroxide. Water may be added to the alcohol at the beginning of the reaction to improve solubility of the metal salt or to dissolve an alcohol which is solid at the reaction temperature. A ligand such as 2,2'-dipyridyl, 2,2':6',2"-terpyridyl, may be added to the reaction mixture. Two nitroxyl radicals can sometimes couple with the same solvent molecule to produce bridged compoundsdescribed in some formulas listed earlier. The formation of bridge compounds is more favored when the amount of solvent is reduced.<br>
Some of the instant hydroxy-substituted N-alkoxy compounds may be reacted with monofunctional or difunctional esters, acids or acid chlorides or isocyanates to form polymeric ester or urethane derivatives.<br><br>
Thus, another object of the invention is a process for the synthesis of the N-(hydroxyalkoxy) substituted hindered amines of formula IV<br><br>
wherein<br>
Gi and G2 are independently alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or G^ and G2 together are pentamethylene;<br>
T is a divalent organic radical required to complete a five- or six-membered ring containing the hindered amine nitrogen atom and two quaternary carbon atoms substituted by G, and G2;<br>
E is a (b + 1) valent afkylene radical of 2 to 18 carbon atoms, an alkenylene radical of 3 to 19 carbon atoms, a cycloalkylene radical of 5 to 12 carbon atoms, a cycloalkenylene radical of 5 to 12 carbon atoms or an alkylene radical of 2 to 4 carbon atoms substituted by phenyl or by phenyl substituted by one or two alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms; and<br>
b is 1,2 or 3; with the proviso that b cannot exceed the number of saturated carbon atoms in E, and when b is 2 or 3, each hydroxyl group is bonded to a different carbon atom in E; which process comprises<br>
reacting a N-oxyl hindered amine of formula V<br><br>
with an alcohol of formula VI<br>
E-{OH)b	(VI)<br>
in the presence oi a peroxide or organic hydroperoxide and a catalytic amount of a metal salt or metal-ligand complex.<br><br>
The N-oxyl compounds of formula V may be prepared by the reaction of the corresponding N-H hindered amine with hydrogen peroxide and sodium tungstate as described by E. G. Rozantsev et at., in Synthesis, 1971.192; or with tert-butyl hydroperoxide and molybdenum (VI) as taught in United States Patent No. 4,691,015.<br>
More specifically, the instant process involves the reaction of a mixture of 5 to 100 moles of the alcohol of formula VI, 1 to 15 moles of hydrogen peroxide or organic hydroperoxide, and 0.001 to 0.5 moles of metal salt or metal-ligand complex per mole of N-oxyl compound of formula V. The reaction is preferably carried out at a temperature in the range of 20Â° to 100Â°C.<br>
The alcohol may serve two functions both as reactant and as solvent for the reaction. A mixture of products may result if the alcohol contains non-equivalent carbon-hydrogen bonds which are reactive in the instant process. For example, tert-butyl alcohol can give only one product whereas tert-amyl alcohol can give three distinct reaction products. A cosolvent may be used if the alcohol is a solid at the temperature of the reaction or if the metal salt or metal-ligand complex is not very soluble in the alcohol. Typical cosolvents are water, methanol and ethylene glycol.<br>
The instant process mainly uses a less than stoichiometric amount, based on peroxide, of a transition metal salt or a metal-ligand complex with the metal chosen from groups IVA, VA, VIIA, VINA or IB {transition metals, metals of lowest weight in these groups being Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) of the periodic table. Iron(ll), iron(lll), copper(l) and copper(ll) are the most effective catalysts. The metal may be in the form of a simple salt such as a metal chloride or sulfate, a metal salt of an organic acid such as acetic acid, or a metal oxide which may also contain a cation from group IA or IIA of the periodic table, such as sodium metavanadate. The metal may also be complexed with a ligand such as 2,2'-dipyridyl, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or its disodium salt, triphenylphosphine oxide, or the anion of acetylacetone. These metal ligand complexes are items of commerce or may be formed in situ by mixing a metal salt with the ligand. The amount of ligand may be less than the amount required to completely complex the metal based on its oxidation state. The metal salt or metal-ligand complex may be bound to a solid support such as silica gel so that it can be<br><br>
recovered and reused.<br>
A mineral acid or sulfonic acid may be added to the reaction mixture in an amount corresponding to up to one mole per mole of nitroxyl moiety.<br>
The instant process can be run in air or in an inert atmosphere such a nitrogen or argon.<br>
There are several variations of the instant process. One variation involves the addition of a solution of aqueous hydrogen peroxide or organic hydroperoxide to a mixture of the N-oxyl hindered amine, the alcohol and cosolvent (if used) and acid (if used), and metal salt or metaMigand complex which has been brought to the desired temperature for reaction. The proper temperature is maintained by controlling the rate of peroxide addition and/or by using a heating or cooling bath. After the peroxide is added, the reaction mixture is stirred till the starting N-oxyl compound of formula V has disappeared or is no longer being converted to the compound of formula IV. The reaction is best monitored by thin layer chromatography, gas chromatography or liquid chromatography. Additional portions of metal salt or metal-ligand complex can be added while the reaction is in progress. After the initial peroxide charge has been added to the reaction mixture, more peroxide can be added dropwise to bring the reaction to completion.<br>
A second variation of the instant process is to simultaneously add separate solutions of the peroxide and the nitroxyl compound to a mixture of the alcohol, cosolvent (if used), acid (if used) and metal salt or metal-ligand complex. The nitroxyl compound may be dissolved in water or the alcohol solvent used in the reaction. Some of the nitroxyl compound may be introduced into the reaction mixture prior to starting the peroxide addition, and all of the nitroxyl compound should be added prior to completing the peroxide addition.<br>
Another variation of the instant process involves the simultaneous addition of separate solutions of the peroxide and of the aqueous or alcohol solution of the metal satt or metai-ligand complex to a mixture of the nitroxyl compound, alcohol, cosolvent<br><br>
(if used), and acid (if used). Some of the metal may be introduced into the reaction mixture prior to starting the peroxide addition.<br>
Still another variation of the instant process is the simultaneous addition of separate solutions of the peroxide, of the aqueous or alcohol solution of the nitroxyl compound, and of an aqueous or alcohol solution of the metal salt or metal-ligand complex to the alcohol, cosolvent (if used) and acid {if used). A portion of the nitroxyl compound and/or metal salt or metal-ligand complex may be introduced into the reaction mixture prior to starting the peroxide addition. All of the nitroxyl compound should be added prior to completing the peroxide addition.<br>

The control sample consists of a stabilizer formulation commonly used in the industry to Impart UV stability. All of the samples contain a pigment, Pigment Red 177, and talc.<br>
The test plaques described earlier contain the following {all concentrations are weight percent based on resin):<br>
Polymer substrate is commercially available polyolefin blend POLYTROPEÂ® TPP 518-01<br>

The compound of Example 73 present in lest plaques NOR-2 specifically shows greatly improved gloss retention compared to the less effective control system and in fact is also more effective that a related hindered amine compound (TINUVIN^ 123) present in test plaques NOR-1. Resistance to color change upon UV exposure is also enhanced.<br>
Polymer blends containing an unsaturated ternary component, such as EPDM blends, are especially benefited with the more efficient instant light stabilizer systems described above.<br>
In all cases, the light stabilized formulations show much greated resistance to photodegradation than unstabilized specimens which fail quickly under the UV exposure conditions outlined above.<br>
Example 77<br>
Paintable TPO<br>
Molded test specimens are prepared by injection molding thermoplastic olefin (TPO) pellets containing the instant compounds, pigments and other coadditives as described in Example 76.<br>
The light stable formulations are painted with one-pack paint systems and tested for TPO/paint interactions. Before painting, the test specimens are first washed in accordance with GM998-4801 and dried for 15 minutes at 200Â°F (94Â°C). Adhesion promoter is applied to the dry film thickness of 0.2-0.4 mils. The samples are dried for five minutes before a 1K basecoat is applied to a film thickness of 1.2-1.4 mils. The painted panels are dried for three minutes, a clearcoat is then applied to a dry film thickness of 1.2-1.5 mils followed by ten minutes flash drying and a 30 minute oven bake at 250Â°F (121Â°C).<br>
Paint adhesion is measured by Aggressive Adhesion Testing (proprietary test procedure conducted at Technical Finishing, Inc.) and Taber Scuff. Painted panels which retain greater than 80% of the paint finish are considered acceptable. After Aggressive Adhesion Testing, samples with less than 5% paint loss are deemed acceptable.<br><br>
Samples are tested to evaluate the TPO/painf interactions as follows:<br>
Aggresive	HALS<br>
Formulation'	Taber Scuff Test        Adhesion Test	p_Ka<br>
A	100% removed	6% Loss (fail)	9.1<br>
B	0% removed	4% Loss (pass)	4.6<br>
C	0% removed	3% Loss (pass)	4.0<br>
Formulation A contains 0.2% CHIMASSORBÂ® 944, 0.2% TINUVINÂ® 328, 500 ppm calcium<br>
stearate and 750 ppm N,N-diaikylhydroxylamine in reactor-grade TPO.<br>

9.1).<br>
Formulations B and C contain 0.2% CHIMASSORBÂ® 119, 0.2% TINUVINÂ® 328, 500 ppm<br>
calcium stearate and 750 ppm N,N-dialkylhydroxylamine in reactor-grade TPO.<br>
B also contains 0.2% of bis(1-octyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyipiperidin-4-yl) sebacate (TINUVINÂ®<br>
123, pKaof4.6).<br>

piperidine (compound of Example 73, pKa of 4.0)<br>
The data in the table indicate that, although formulation A failed in both the Taber Scuff and Aggressive Adhesion Tests, both formulations B and C passed both paint adhesion tests. However, as inspection of the pKa values attests, the lower the pKa value (less basic) for the test hindered amine compound the less paint loss results in this Aggressive Adhesion Test. The instant compound of Example 73 having the hydroxyl moiety present has the lowest pKa value and also the least paint loss even better than the close prior art compound where no hydroxyl moiety is present.<br><br>

The films containing the instant compound mixture show good light stabilizing efficacy.<br>
Example 82<br>
Film grade polyethylene is dry blended with 10% loading of the test additives, such as (he compound of Example 51, as described in Example 81, and then melt compounded at 200Â°C into fully formulated master batch pellets.

Example 110<br>
Coatings over Plastic Substrates<br><br>
A major application for non-basic hindered amines is in the protection of automotive topcoats applied over plastic substrates. However, many low molecular weight, non-reactable light stabilizers migrate into the plastic substrate during drying and cure. As a consequence, a significant portion of the light stabilizer may be lost from the topcoat into the substrate and hence be ineffective in protecting said topcoat.<br>
The extent of migration of hindered amine stabilizers during application and cure of the coating is determined by comparing the concentration of hindered amine in the cured clearcoat applied over a plastic substrate versus the same clearcoat applied over a non-permeable substrate such as glass or steel.<br>
Hindered amine stabilizers under test are incorporated into a flexible thermoset acrylic/melamine clear coating appropriate for use on automotive plastic substrates. The hindered amine is incorporated at a level of 1.5% by weight based on total resins solids.<br>
Each coating formulation is applied by an automatic spray appratus onto automotive grade RIM (Reacting Injection Molded) substrate and TPO (thermoplastic polyolefin). Both substrates are in form of 4" x 12" plaques. Each coating is applied to achieve a dry film thickness of approximately 2.0 mils (50 microns). The coatings are cured by baking at 250Â°F (121Â°C) for 20 minutes.<br>
Triplicate samples of each cured coating formulation are removed from each substrate and cryoground to a fine powder. A known amount of each sample is extracted in refluxing toluene overnight. The hindered amine present is analyzed quantitatively by dilution to a known volume and analyzed by HPLC or SFC chromatography. Calibration curves for each test stabilizer compound are developed. The hindered amine content of each extracted coating is determined by this method.<br>
When the instant hindered amine compounds substituted on the N-atom with an -O-E-OH moiety are compared to the corresponding -NOR compounds lacking such a hydroxyl moiety, a higher percent recovery of the instant hindered amine compound from the clearcoat over a plastic substrate is found indicating that much less of the instant hindered amine<br><br>
stabilizer migrates into the plastic substrate allowing for better stabilization of the clear topcoat over such plastic substrates.<br>
Example 111<br>
Stabilization of Waterborne Wood Varnish<br>
Waterborne coating comprise a significant and increasing proportion of the coating in use for a wide variety of applications including automotive basecoats, industrial coatings and trade sale coatings. These coatings may be pigmented or transparent. The trends are also towards higher solids formulation which in general depend on light stabilizers to maintain properties on exterior exposure, and towards lower levels of cosolvents. This requires higher solubility of stabilizers in such cosolvents (primarily water) or actual solubility in water.<br>
The test stabilizers are incorporated into a waterborne dispersion by predissolution in a cosolvent blend. The waterborne dispersion is a commercially available acrylic/urethane hydrid resin. The cosolvent blend is a 1:1 mixture of TEXANOLÂ® (2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol, Texaco) and ARCOSOLVEÂ® TPM (tripropylene glycol methyl ether, AtlanticRichfield).<br>
0.45 gram of the test stabilizer is predissolved in 10 g of the cosolvent blend which is then incorporated into the following composition:<br>

UV absorber (TINUVINÂ® 1130, Ciba)	1.2<br>
BYK 346	0.5<br>
MICHEMLUBEÂ®162	2.0<br><br>
Each coating is brush applied onto 6" x 6" sections of cedar and pine boards. The weight of the coating applied is regulated by weighing the coating and brush before and after application and ensuring that the same weight of coating is applied to each section.<br>
The coated board sections are allowed to dry at ambient temperature for two weeks, then evaluated for visual appearance, gloss and Hunter L", a* and b* color. The sections are exposed on racks at a 45Â° angle in South Florida for six months before being returned and evaluated for visual appearance, gloss, color change and any other signs of degradation or delamination.<br>
The instant hindered amine compounds substituted on the N-atom with an -O-E-OH moiety provide better stabilization efficacy to the sections in respect to visual appearance, gloss retention, resistance to color change and to delamination than do the corresponding -NOR compounds lacking such a hydroxyl moiety.<br>
Example 112<br>
Stabilization of Pigmented Automotive OEM Basecoat<br>
A basecoat pigmented with a mixture of Pigment Red 177 and mica is stabilized with 1% by weight of a hindered amine stabilizer based on the total basecoat solids (pigment plus resin). The basecoat is spray applied at a dry film thickness of 1 mil (25 microns) to primed 4" x 12" steel panels, then topcoated with a high solids commercially available automotive clearcoat. The coated panels are cured in an over at 250Â°F (121Â°C) for 30 minutes. The panels are then exposed in a Xenon-Arc Weather-Ometer under the following conditions:<br>
Cam 180 cycle: 40 minutes light only; 20 minutes light and front spray; 60 minutes light only; 60 minutes dark and rear spray condensate.<br>
Lamp filters are: quartz inner/borosilicate S outer.<br>
Irradiance: 0.55 watts per square meter.<br><br>
20Â° Gloss, Distinctness of Image, Hunter Color Space Values (L*, a*, b* and AE) are measured before exposure and after 3000 hours of exposure.<br>
The instant hindered amine compounds substituted on the N-atom with an -O-E-OH moiety provide better stabilization efficacy to the panels in respect to distinctness of image, gloss retention and resistance to color change than do the corresponding -NOR compounds lacking such a hydroxyl moiety.<br>
Example 113 ABS Molding Applications<br>

Typical formulations contain the instant compounds at levels from 0.05% to 2.0%, a metal stearate such as calcium stearate at 0.05% to 0.5%, pigments from 0% to 5%, UV absorbers at levels of 0.05% to 2.0%, phosphites at 0.0% -0.1%, phenolic antioxidants at 0.0%-1.25%, N,N-dialkylhydroxylamine at 0.0%-0.1%, and optionally other hindered amine stabilizers at levels of 0.0% to 2.0%.<br>
The pelletized fully formulated resin is then processed into a useful article such as extrusion into sheet, film, profile and pipe ; molded into bottles; injection molded into a molded article; thermoformed into molded articles; or rotational molded into hollow articles.<br>
The materials containing the instant compounds exhibit stability against deleterious effects of UV light and thermal exposure.<br>
Example 114<br><br>
pKa Values<br>
In order to determine the pKa values of water insoluble materials, organic references with known pKa values in water are titrated non-aqueously. A plot of the half neutralization potential (HNP) versus the known aqueous pKa value of the reference material is establed. The HNP of the test material is determined and extrapolated to find the corresponding pKa value of the test material. Such organic reference materials include 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine; 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpipehdine; 1-hydroxyethyl-4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine; triacetoneamine and N-methylaniline.<br>
The reference materials, which are structurally at least peripherally related to the instant test materials and are soluble in both water and 1:1 acetonitrile:chloroform, are used to make a calibration plot in the non-aqueous titration (1:1 acetonitrilexhloroforrn solvent and 0.1N perchloric acid/dioxane titrant) system. Approximately 0.5 milliequivalents of test material is weighed into a titration beaker. Thirty ml_ of acetonitrile is added to dissolve the sample. Prior to titration, 30 mL of chloroform is added. Titration is carried out and the HNP is determined. The electrolyte for the reference electrode is 2-(aminomethylpyridine. The electrode is allowed to stand in the solvent system for two hours after filling with the electrolyte to achieve equilibration. All samples are run in duplicate. The pKa values are seen in the table below.<br>

II	436	4.9<br>
III	513	3.8<br>
IV	--	4.6<br>
V	-	3.8<br>

*l is the compound of Example 73.<br>
II is 1-cyclohexyloxy-4-ocatadecanoyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine.<br><br>
III	is the compound of Example 2.<br>
IV	is bis{1-octyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl) sebacate.<br>
V	is the compound of Example 50.<br>
VI	is the reaction product of 2,4-bis[N-(1 -cyclohexyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl) butyl -amino] -6-chloro-s-triazine with N,N'-bis(3-aminopropyl)ethylenediamine.<br>
As can be seen from each of the above pairs of related compounds where the individual compounds differ from the other only by whether the 1-position of the piperidine ring is substituted by an -O-R group or by an -O-E-OH, the instant -O-E-OH compounds consisting have a significantly lower pKa value meaning that said instant compounds are distinguished by consistently lower basicity than the prior art N-OR compounds.<br>
Inspection of the results given in Example 77 shows that this lower basicity and lower pKa values can be translated into superior performance for the instant compounds compared to the closely related prior art N-OR compounds in preventing paint loss on paintable thermoplastic polyolefins (TPO).<br>

The stabilizers under test are added to the thermoset acrylic resin finishing enamel in a concentration of 1 % by weight before the enamel is coated onto the base coat.<br>
The coated sheets, after storage for three weeks in an air-conditioned room (23Â°C/50% relative humidity), are subjected to weathering for 2000 hours according to SAE J1920 in a Xenon arc Weather-Ometer. In this apparatus, samples are subjected to weathering in repeated cycles of 180 minutes. The effectiveness of the stabilization is measured by the retention of 20Â° gloss after weathering.<br><br>

Stabilization of Tung Oil Phenolic Varnish<br>
Pieces of 1.27 cm x 20.32 cm x 30.48 cm western red cedar panels having a fine radial cut are used to test a commercially available tung oil phenolic varish (supplied by McCloskey). One half of each panel is coated with two coats of unstabilized varnish. An equal amount of vamish containing 5% by weight (based on resin solids) of test stabilizers is applied to the other half of the panel in two coats. After storage for two weeks at ambient temperature, the wood panels are exposed outdoors at an angle of 45Â° S for a period of eight months. The 60Â° gloss of each half of the panel is measured at the top, middle and bottom portion of the panel and averaged according to ASTM D 523. Due to the lack of homogeneity of wood substrates, the gloss retention of the same vamish tends to differ slightly from panel to panel. Thus, the application of an unstabilized control varnish to every panel allows for a more meaningful measurement of the improvement in gloss due to the presence of the instant test compound.<br>
The panels stabilized by the instant compounds show excellent gloss retention after long exposure.<br><br>
Example 129<br>
Stabilization of an Aromatic Urethane Varnish<br>

Prior to application, the instant test compounds are added to the paint. After ambient storage for two weeks, three panels of each formulation are exposed outdoors at an angle of 45Â° S for a period of nine months. Thereafter, 20Â° gloss retention is determined by ASTM D 523-80 at the top, middle and bottom portions of each panel. Thus, the average values for nine gloss retention measurements for each triplicate set of panels are obtained.<br>

Electrocoat Composition<br>
A typical E-coat composition is prepared by adding the diglyicidyl ether of bisphenol A, polyethylene oxide diol, bisphenol A and xylene to a flask and heating to 135Â°C. The catalyst dimethylbenzylamine in xylene is added and the temperature maintained at 143Â°C for two hours. The weight per epoxy (WPE) is measured and a previously prepared crosslinker composed of 2,4-toluenediisocyanate, trimethylolpropane blocked with an alcohol is then added and temperature reduced to 100Â°C. The remaining epoxy groups are then capped with two different secondary amines, namely diketimine of diethylenetriamine and methylethanolamine, in phenyl cellosolve. The temperature is maintained for one hour at 110CC and the crosslinker hexa-methylenediisocyanate blocked with an alcohol is added. The temperature is maintained near 100Â°C for 30 minutes and the resin mixture is added to deionized water, surfactant and lactic acid to give a resin emulsion.<br>
To this resin emulsion is added the instant hindered amine compound, additional epoxy resin, carbon black, dibutyltin oxide catalyst, titanium dioxide, lead silicate, water and UV<br><br>
absorber. After dispersion using a sand mill to achieve proper fineness, the mixture is incorporated into an electrocoat bath with water tor electrocoating onto a metal substrate.<br>
The steel coating electrocoated with the above E-coat resin composition to a thickness of 23-30 urn and cured for 20 minutes at a temperature of 176-201 Â°C. A pigmented resin layer is coated thereover at a thickness of 20-51 urn using an acrylic coating composition in an organic solver, pigments and a UV absorber. The coated panels are then baked at 121 -129Â°C to cure the pigmented layer.<br>
The panels are then exposed outdoors for four months. The panels containing the instant hindered amine compound, particularly when used with a UV absorber, provided excellent resistance to delamination of the E-coat layer from the metal substrate.<br>

The coating is catalyzed with 0.015% by weight of dibutyltin dilaurate catalyst.<br>
Plaques of polycarbonate-based plastic substrate (Xenoy) 4" x 6" are coated with the formulated clear coat at a thickness of approximately 1.5 mils. The coating is spray applied to the substrate and then baked at 82Â°C for 20 minutes.<br>
After storage for one week at room temperature, each plaque is cut into 2" x 3" strips with five replicates being made for each formulation. Each strip is placed into a 8-oz jar along with 2 mL of distilled water and sealed. All samples are placed in an over at 54 Â°C. A Crosshatch adhesion test is performed once a week on at least two of the replicate samples until the sample failed (5% adhesion loss) or until 40 days elapses.<br>
The samples containing the instant hindered amine compounds exhibit excellent resistance to delamination.<br>

absorber is also incoporated into all formulations. The Hindered Amine light stabilizers are added at equivalent piperidine levels. After mixing, the clear coatings are applied by brushing to white pine boards. Each board is divided into 8 sections separated by a groove 1/8" deep, which is sealed with a film-forming clear varnish and the back and sides are coated with a white chlorinated pool paint. The stabilized coatings are applied in triplicate in three coats to sections of the boards in such a way as to ensure that a control formulation is present on each of the boards for comparison. The wood samples are allowed to dry for 1 week, then placed on exposure in Florida, Australia, and New York.<br>
The panels stabilized by the instant compounds show good color retention, cracking resistance, and visual gloss retention.<br>
Example 143<br>
Performed Films for Lamination to plastic parts<br>
The instant invention also pertains to protective and decorative films which are performed, then applied to a substrate via a dry paint transfer process. These films consist of a single decorative layer which is applied to a carrier sheet, then laminated to a self-supporting, thermoformable backing sheet. The carrier sheet is then removed from the opposite side of the film, exposing the decorative layer. The composite film/backing sheet then is thermoformed to a three-dimensional shape. Additionally, these films may also consist of multiple layers, where, for example, a thermoplastic, thermoformable clearcoat is applied to the carrier sheet, then hardened to form an optically clear film. A color coat is then applied to the exposed face of the clearcoat, and hardened, resulting in a clear coat/color coat paint film supported by the carrier. This composite is then laminated to a thermoformable backing sheet, as above. The carrier sheet is removed, as above, and the composite clearcoat/colorcoat/backing is then thermoformed, as above.<br>
The polymeric resins for the above application must be thermoplastic, and may be fluoropolymer/acrylic blends.<br><br><br>

unsubstituted. These compounds are especially useful in polymers including polybutadiene, polystyrene, ABS, polyacetal, polyamide, polyester, polyurethane and polycarbonate.<br>
United States Patent No. 5,096,950 also describes hindered amine compounds which are substituted on the N-atom by alkoxy moieties which alkoxy groups are themselves unsubstituted. These compounds are found to be useful in polyolefins.<br>
The instant compounds are N-alkoxy substituted derivatives of 2,2,6,6-tetraalkyl-piperidines where the alkoxy group is substituted by one to three hydroxy moieties. The instant compounds also comprise N-alkoxy bridged derivatives of the 2,2,6,6-tetraalkylpiperidines where the alkoxy moiety, which is substituted by one to three hydroxy groups, is shared by two hindered amine molecules. The free hydroxy moieties of these compounds may be reacted with carboxylic acids, acid chlorides or esters to form simple esters or polyesters, or with isocyanates to form urethanes or polyurethanes.<br>
The instant compounds, because of their low bascity which is shared by the simple unsubstituted N-alkoxy compounds cited in the two patents mentioned above, are of particular value in the stabilization of polyolefins and automotive coating compositions where the activity of the more basic hindered amine stabilizes is significantly reduced because of interaction with the polymer substrate or acid catalytic system needed for curing such substrate.<br>
Examples of polyolefin compositions in which the instant compounds are effective include flame retardant polyolefins where acidic residues from the decomposition of the halogenated flame retardants deactivate hindered amines not having the N-OR group, greenhouse films and agricultural mulch films where acidic residues from pesticides interfere with the activity of "normal" hindered amine stabilizers, and in thermoplastic polyolefins where pigment interactions with basic hindered amine stabilizers interfere with painting the substrate surfaces. Examples of coating compositions in which the instant compounds are effective include melamine crosslinked thermoset acrylic resins, which are cured using strong acids that interact with basic hindered amine stabilizers. The instant compounds are also effective in acrylic alkyd or polyester resins with isocyanate crosslinking agents, and in epoxy resins with carboxylic acid, anhydride, or amine crosslinking agents.<br><br>
Thus, current compounds are advantageously used in compositions also containing costabilizers, flame retardants (e.g. tris(3-bromo-2,2-bis(bromomethyl)propyl)phosphate, decabromodiphenyl oxide, ethylene bis-(tetrabromophthalimide), or ethylene bis-(dibromo-norbornanedicarboximide)), catalysts (e.g. acids like toluene sulfonic acid, metal driers or amines), fillers, or in agricultural applications wherein pesticides come in contact with the stabilized polymer. Preferred is a composition wherein component (a) is polypropylene, polyethylene, thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO), ABS or high impact polystyrene (HIPS), and component (b) is an effective synergistic mixture of<br>
(i) a compound of formula (1) to (30); and<br>
(ii) a flame retardant selected from the group consisting of the halogenated, phosphorus, boron, silicon and antimony compounds, metal hydroxides, metal hydrates, metal oxides and mixtures thereof.<br>
While the unsubstituted N-OR compounds described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,004,770 and 5,096,950 aJso perform well in the compositions described in the paragraph above, the instant compounds differ significantly in both structure and in performance from the prior art compounds by virtue of the presence of the one to three free hydroxy groups present on the N-alkoxy moiety. These hydroxyl groups in the instant compounds provide said compounds with superior antistatic properties, compatibility in more polar environments such as polyurethane based and in water-borne automotive coating systems, and in stabilizing painted automotive thermoplastic olefin structures.<br>
The instant compounds are particularly suited for<br>
(a)	providing superior compatibility in polycarbonates and polycarbonate/ABS blends compared to the N-OE prior art compounds; and<br>
(b)	providing superior compatibility in polyesters and polyamides compared to the prior art N-OE compounds.<br>

It is also contemplated that the instant compounds would find particular value when used with water-soluble inks and related polar oriented utilities where the presence of the OH moiety would provide for better compatibility and properties related to such aqueous environments.<br>
The instant compounds are also useful in the stabilization of acid catalyzed thermoset resins which are disclosed in United States Patent No. 5,112,890, the relevant parts of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
These resins are used in baked enamels or stoving lacquers. Hindered amine light stabilizaers are well known to be effective in stabilizing a host of organic substrates including polymers from the deleterious effects of oxygen and light. Such hindered amine light stabilizers have been used in the stabilization of hot-crosslinkable alkyd or acrylic metallic stoving lacquers (see U.S. Patent No. 4,426,472) and in stabilizing acid-catalyzed stoving lacquers based on hot-crosslinkable acrylic polyester or alkyl resins (see U.S. Patent Nos. 4,344,876 and 4,426,471). None of the hindered amine light stabilizers of these patents possess structures having an O-substituted hydroxyl group substituted directly on the N-atom of the hindered amine. The instant compounds have such substitution and additionally are even less basic than the NOR compounds described in U.S. Patent No. 5,112,890 as is seen in instant working Example 114.<br>
In their industrial uses, enamels with high solids content based on crosslinkable acrylic, polyester, urethane or alkyd resins are cured with an additional acid catalyst. Light stabilizers containing a basic nitrogen group are generally less than satisfactory in this application. Formation of a salt between the acid catalyst and the light stabilizer leads to incompatibility or insolubility and recipitation of the salt and to a reduced level of cure and to reduced light protective action and poor resistance to moisture.<br>
The acid catalyzed thermoset enamels must be stabilized in order to function acceptably in end-use applications. The stabilizers used are hindered amines, preferably those substituted on the N-atom by an inert blocking group in order to prevent precipitation of the basic amine with the acid catalyst with a concomitant retardation in cure, optionally in combination with UV absorbers as described above.<br><br>
The stabilizers are needed to impart greater retention of durability to the cured enamels (as measured by 20"' gloss, distinction of image, cracking or chalking); the stabilizers must not retard cure (normal bake for auto finishes at 121 Â°C; and tow bake repair at 82'C) as measured by hardness, adhesion, solvent resistance and humidity resistance; the enamel should not yellow on curing and further color change on exposure to light should be minimized; the stabilizers should be soluble in the organic solvents normally used in coating applications, such as methyl amyl ketone, xylene, n-hexyl acetate, alcohol and the like.<br>
The instant hindered amine light stabilizers on the N-atom by an 0-substituted moiety containing a free hydroxy! group fulfill each of these requirements and provide alone or in combination with a UV absorber outstanding light stabilization protection to the cured acid catalyzed thermoset enamels.<br>
The instant invention also pertains to resin systems capable of being fully cured under ambient conditions. For example, applicable resins include alkyd, acrylic, polyester and epoxide resins as described in S. Paul's "Surface Coatings: Science and Technology" (1985), pages 70-310, Various acrylic and modified acrylic resins are described in H. Kittel's "Lehrbuch der Lacke unde Beschichtungen", Vol. 1, Part 2, on pages 735 and 742 (Berlin 1972), and in "Lack-kunstharze" (1977) by H. Wagner and H. F. Sarx, op. cit, on pages 229-238. Typical crosslinkable polyester resins which can be stabilized against the action of light and moisture are described e.g. in H. Wagner and H. F. Sarx, op. cit., on pages 86-99. The unmodified and modified alkyd resins which can be stabilized are conventional resins which are used in trade sales, maintenance and automotive refinish coatings. For example, such coatings are based on alkyd resins, alkyd/acrylic resins and alkyd/silicon reins (see H. Wagner and H. F. Sarx, op. cit., pages 99-123) optionally crosslinked by isocyanates or epoxy resins.<br>
In addition various acrylic lacquer coating compositions are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,162,249. Other acrylic/alkyd resins with polyisocyanate additives are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,471,083; and acrylic resins containing either pendant amino ester groups or glycidyl groups are described in U.S. Patent No, 4,525,521.<br>
The ambient cured coatings stabilized by the instant compounds are suitable both for metal finish coatings and solid shade finishes, especially in the case of retouching finishes. The<br><br>
lacquers stabilized by the instant compounds are preferably applied in a conventional manner by two methods, either by the single-coat method or by the two-coat method. In the latter method, the pigment-containing base coat is applied first and a covering coat of clear lacquer applied over it. When used in two-coat finishes, the instant hindered amine compound can be incorporated in the clear coat or both in the clear coat and in the pigmented base coat.<br>
The instant invention also pertains to abrasion-resistant coating compositions suitable for coating over polycarbonates. Such coatings as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,214,085 comprise a silyl acrylate, aqueous colloidal silica, a photoinitiator and optionally a polyfunctional acrylate as well as UV absorbers. Such coatings provide resistance after prolonged outdoor exposure to sunlight, moisture, thermal cycling causing yellowing, delamination and formation of microcracks and decreasing transparency.<br>
Related hindered amine stabilizers have been utilized individually and in combination with UV absorbers to improve the performance characteristics of ambient cured coating systems. Notwithstanding such improvements, there still exists a need to further retard the photooxidation and photodegradation of such ambient cured systems and thereby provide increased effectiveness by maintaining the physical integrity of the coatings. Such effectiveness can be manifested by prevention of embrittlement, cracking, corrosion, erosion, loss of gloss, chalking and yellowing of the coating.<br>
It has now been determined that the aforementioned improvements canbe achieved by substitution of the N-atom of the hindered amines with an -OR moiety and by the utilization of such derivatives in ambient cured coating systems as is taught in United States Patent No. 5,124,378, the relevant parts of which are incorporated herein by reference. The instant compounds are even less basic than the compounds of U.S. 5,124,378 and are particularly well suited for this task. In particular, the physical integrity of the coatings is maintained to a higher degree with significant reduction in loss of gloss and in yellowing. Accordingly, the instant invention relates to the use of the instant NOR compounds, where the R moiety is further substituted by a hydroxy! group, optionally together with further stabilizers, for stabilizing ambient cured coatings based on alkyd resins; thermoset acrylic resins; acrylic alkyds; acrylic alkyd or polyester resins optionally modified with silicon, isocyanates, isocyanurates, ketimines or oxazolidines; and epoxide resins crosslinked with carboxylic acids, anhydrides, polyamines<br><br>
or mercaptans; and acrylic and polyester resin systems modified with reactive groups in the backbone thereof and crosslinked with epoxides; against the degradative effects of light, moisture and oxygen.<br>
The instant invention also relates to electrodeposited coatings applied to metal substrates where various top coats may be applied thereover. The inclusion of the instant compounds in the E-coat provides delamination resistance to said E-coats. The primary resins in said E-coats are acrylic or epoxy resins. These E-coats are described in European patent application EP 0 576 943 A1.<br>
The instant invention also pertains to UV-cured coating systems using unsaturated acrylic resins, polyurethane acrylates, epoxy acrylates, polyester acrylates, unsaturated polyester/styrene resins and silyl acrylates.<br>
Powder Coatinos<br>
The instant invention also pertains to powder coating formulations which require resistance to photodegradation. Resin systems which would be applicable include glycidal methacrylate or acrylate-functional acrylic or acrylic hybrids, crosslinked with diacids or anhydrides; acid or anhydride functional acrylic or polyester resins crosslinked with TGIC; hydroxyl functional acrylic or polyester resins crosslinked with isocyanates. The stabilized coating may be a single layer applied to a substrate, or may be a clearcoat applied over a waterborne or solvent-borne basecoat.<br>
The stabilized coating may also contain a UV absorber, consisting of one of the aforementioned compounds.<br>
Radiation-Cured Systems<br>
The instant invention also pertains to radiation-cured coating systems. These systems would consist of:<br>
a.	Ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable comopounds<br>
b.	At least one photoinitiator<br><br>
c. One or more of the instant stabilizing compounds<br>
The coating composition may also include a UV absorbing stabilizer, represented by one of the classes mentioned..<br>
The coating may also include pigments or other colorants designed to provide opacity or aesthetic properties.<br>

Further suitable polyols are polymers and copolymers which contain hydroxyl groups in the polymer chain or in side groups, for example polyvinyl alcohol and copolymers thereof or hydroxyalkyi polymethacrylates or copolymers thereof. Other suitable polyols are oligoesters carrying hydroxyl end groups.<br>

The polyols may be esterified partially or completely with one or with different unsaturated carboxylic acids, in which case the free hydroxyl groups of the partial esters may be modified, for example etherified, or esterified with other carboxylic acids.<br>
Illustrative examples of esters are: Trimethylolpropane triacrylate, thmethylolethane triacrylate, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, thmethylolethane trimethacrylate, tetramethylene glycol dimethacrylate, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, tetraethylene glycol diacrylate.<br><br>

Polyfunctional monomers and oligomers are available for example from UCB Chemicals, Smyrna, Georgia, and Sartomer, Exton, Pennsylvania.<br>
Suitable ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable compounds are also the amides of identical or different unsaturated carboxylic acids of aromatic, cycloaliphatic and aliphatic polyamines containing preferably 2 to 6, more particularly 2 to 4, amino groups. Exemplary of such polyamines are ethylenediamine, 1,2- or 1,3-propylenediamine, 1,2-, 1,3-or 1,4-butylenediamine, 1,5-pentylenediamine, 1,6-hexylenediamine, octylenediamine, dodecylenediamine, 1,4-diaminocyclohexane, isophoronediamine, phenylenediamine, bisphenylenediamine, bis(p-aminoethyl) ether, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, bis((3-aminoethoxy)ethane or bis(|3-aminopropoxy)ethane. Other suitable polyamines are polymers and copolymers which may contain additional amino groups in the side-chain and oligoamides containing amino end groups.<br>
Exemplary of such unsaturated amides are: Methylenebisacrylamide, 1,6-hexamethytenebisacrylamide, diethylenetriaminetrismethacrylamide, bis(methacrylamidopropoxy)ethane, p-methacrylamidoethylmethacrylate, N-[(p-hydroxyethoxy)ethyl]acrylamide.<br>
Suitable unsaturated polyesters and polyamides are derived typically from maleic acid and diols or diamines. Maleic acid can be partially replaced by other dicarboxylic acids such as<br><br>
fumaric acid, itaconic acid, citraconic acid, mesaconic acid or chloromaleic acid. To control the reactivity of the polyester and to influence the crosslinking density and hence the product properties, it is possible to use in addition to the unsaturated dicarboxylic acids different amounts of saturated dicarboxylic acids such as phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid, succinic acid or adipic acid. The unsaturated polyesters can be used together with ethylenically unsaturated comonomers such as styrene. The polyesters and polyamides can also be derived from dicarboxylic acids and ethylenically unsaturated diols or diamines, especially from those with long chains containing typically from 6 to 20 carbon atoms. Polyurethanes are typically those derived from saturated or unsaturated diisocyanates and unsaturated and saturated diols.<br>
Suitable polyester acrylates or acrylated polyesters are obtained by reacting oligomers, typically epoxides, urethanes, polyethers or polyesters, with acrylates such as hydroxyethyl acrylate or hydroxypropyl acrylate.<br>
Polybutadiene and polyisoprene and copolymers thereof are known. Suitable comonomers include olefins such as ethylene, propene, butene, hexene, (meth)acrylates, acrylonitrile, styrene or vinyl chloride. Polymers containing (meth)acrylate groups in the side-chain are also known. They may typically be reaction products of epoxy resins based on novolak with (meth)acrylic acid, homo- or copolymers of polyvinyl alcohol or their hydroxyalkyi derivatives which are esterified with (meth)acrylic acid or homo- and copolymers of (meth)acrylates which are esterified with hydroxyalkyl(meth)acrylates.<br>
Preferred monomers are typically alkyl- or hydroxyalkyi acrylates or methacrylates, styrene, ethylene glycol diacrylate, propylene glycol diacrylate, neopentyl glycol diacrylate, hexamethylene glycol diacrylate or bisphenol A diacrylate, 4,4'-bis(2-<br>
acryloyloxyethoxy)diphenylpropane, trimethylolpropane triacrylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate or tetraacrylate, preferably acrylates, styrene, hexamethylene glycol or bisphenol A diacrylate, 4,4'-bis(2-acryloyloxyethoxy)diphenylpropane or trimethylolpropane triacrylate.<br>
Particularly preferred (oligomeric) polyunsaturated compounds are polyester acrylates or unsaturated polyester resins which are prepared from maleic acid, fumaric acid, phthalic acid<br><br>
and one or more than one diol, and which typically have molecular weights from about 500 to<br>
3000.<br>
Preferred unsaturated carboxylic acids are acrylic acid and methacrylic acid.<br>
The photopolymerizable compounds are used by themselves or in any desired mixtures. It is preferred to use mixtures of polyol(meth)acrylates.<br>
Binders may also be added to the unsaturated photopolymerizable compounds. The addition of binders is particularly useful if the photopolymerizable compounds are liquid or viscous substances. The amount of binder may be from 5-95, preferably 10-90 and, most preferably, 40-90, percent by weight, based on the entire composition. The choice of binder will depend on the field of use and the desired properties therefore, such as the ability of the compositions to be developed in aqueous and organic solvent systems, adhesion to substrates and susceptibility to oxygen.<br>
Suitable binders are typically polymers having a molecular weight of about 5,000 to 2,000,000, preferably 10,000 to 1,000,000. Illustrative examples are: Homo- and copolymers of acrylates and methacrylates, including copolymers of methyl methacrylate/ethyl acrylate/methacrylic acid, poly(alkyimethacrylates), poly(alkylacrylates); cellulose esters and ethers such as cellulose acetate, cellulose acetobutyrate, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose; polyvinyl butyral, polyvinyl formal, cyclized rubber, polyethers such as polyethylene oxide, polypropylene oxide, polytetrahydrofuran; polystyrene, polycarbonate, polyurethane, chlorinated polyolefins, polyvinyl chloride, copolymers of vinyl chloride/vinylidene chloride, copolymers of vinylidene chloride with acrylonitrile, methyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate, polyvinyl acetate, copoly(ethylene/vinyl acetate), polymers such as polycaprolactam and poly(hexamethylene adipamide), polyesters such as poly(ethylene glycol terephthalate) and poly(hexamethylene glycol succinate).<br>
The unsaturated compounds can also be used in admixture with non-photopolymerizable film-forming components. These components may be physically drying polymers or solutions thereof in organic solvents, for example nitrocellulose or cellulose acetobutyrate. The photopolymerizable unsaturated monomers may be a component of a free radical-ionic curable<br><br>
blend, such as a free radical-cationic curable blend. Also of importance are systems that undergo both thermal and photo-induced curing cycles, such as are used in powder coatings, laminates, certain adhesives and conformal coatings.<br>
Mixtures of a prepolymer with polyunsaturated monomers which, additionally contain a further unsaturated monomer are frequently used in paint systems. The prepolymer in this instance primarily determines the properties of the paint film and, by varying it, the skilled person can influence the properties of the cured film. The polyunsaturated monomer acts as crosslinking agent that renders the paint film insoluble. The mono-unsaturated monomer acts as reactive diluent with the aid of which the viscosity is lowered without having to use a solvent. Moreover, properties of the cured composition such as curing rate, crosslinking density and surface properties are dependent on the choice of monomer.<br>
Unsaturated polyester resins are usually used in two-component systems, together with a mono-unsaturated monomer, preferably with styrene.<br>
Binary electron-rich/electron-poor monomer systems are often employed in thick pigmented coatings. For example, vinyl ether/unsaturated polyester systems are employed in powder coatings and styrene/unsaturated polyester systems are used in gel coats.<br>
A preferred process is that wherein the ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable compounds are a mixture of (i) at least one oligomeric compound and (ii) at least one monomer.<br>
An interesting process is that wherein the ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable compounds are a mixture of (i) unsaturated polyesters, especially those that are prepared from maleic acid, fumaric acid and/or phthalic acid and one or more than one diol, and which have molecular weights of 500 to 3,000, and (ii) acrylates, methacrylates or styrene or combinations thereof.<br>
An important process is also that wherein the ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable compounds are a mixture of (i) unsaturated polyesters and (ii) acrylates or methacrylates or combinations thereof.<br><br>
Another interesting process is that wherein the ethylenically unsaturated poiymerizable compounds are a mixture of (i) unsaturated polyester acrylates and (ii) acrylates or methacrylates or combinations thereof.<br>
Synthesis of Compounds<br>
The instant compounds may be prepared by the reaction of tributyltin hydride and a halogen substituted alcohol to produce carbon centered radicals that are trapped by nitroxyl compounds.<br>
The instant compounds may also be prepared by coupling an N-oxyl hindered amine with a carbon centered radical generated by the photochemical or thermal decomposition of a perester or dialkyi peroxide in the presence of an alcohol. The bridge compounds described above can be formed when two nitroxyl radicals couple with the same solvent molecule, especially when the amount of solvent is reduced.<br>
The preferred method of preparation of the instant compounds is to react an N-oxyl hindered amine with a carbon centered radical generated by mixing an aqueous or alcoholic solution of a metal ion such as Fe'"", Fe'"', Cu'"" or Cu"*" and a peroxide such as tert-butyl hydroperoxide or hydrogen peroxide in the presence of an alcohol solvent at a temperature of 20-80Â°C. Especially effective is the combination of ferrous chloride, ferric chloride or ferrous sulfate, particularly ferrous chloride, or ferric chloride, and hydrogen peroxide. Water may be added to the alcohol at the beginning of the reaction to improve solubility of the metal salt or to dissolve an alcohol which is solid at the reaction temperature. A ligand such as 2,2'-dipyridyl, 2,2':6',2"-terpyridyl, may be added to the reaction mixture. Two nitroxyl radicals can sometimes couple with the same solvent molecule to produce bridged compoundsdescribed in some formulas listed earlier. The formation of bridge compounds is more favored when the amount of solvent is reduced.<br>
Some of the instant hydroxy-substituted N-alkoxy compounds may be reacted with monofunctional or difunctional esters, acids or acid chlorides or isocyanates to form polymeric ester or urethane derivatives.<br><br>
Thus, another object of the invention is a process for the synthesis of the N-(hydroxyalkoxy) substituted hindered amines of formula IV<br><br>
wherein<br>
Gi and G2 are independently alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or Gi and G2 together are pentamethyiene;<br>
T is a divalent organic radical required to complete a five- or six-membered ring containing the hindered amine nitrogen atom and two quaternary carbon atoms substituted by Gi and G2;<br>
E is a (b + 1) valent alkylene radical of 2 to 18 carbon atoms, an alkenylene radical of 3 to 19 carbon atoms, a cycloalkylene radical of 5 to 12 carbon atoms, a cycloalkenylene radical of 5 to 12 carbon atoms or an alkylene radical of 2 to 4 carbon atoms substituted by phenyl or by phenyl substituted by one or two alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms; and<br>
b is 1, 2 or 3; with the proviso that b cannot exceed the number of saturated carbon atoms in E, and when b is 2 or 3, each hydroxyl group is bonded to a different carbon atom in E; which process comprises<br>
reacting a N-oxyl hindered amine of formula V<br><br>
with an alcohol of formula VI<br>
E-(OH)b	(VI)<br>
in the presence of a peroxide or organic hydroperoxide and a catalytic amount of a metal salt or metal-ligand complex.<br><br>
The N-oxyl compounds of formula V may be prepared by the reaction of the corresponding N-H hindered amine with hydrogen peroxide and sodium tungstate as described by E. G. Rozantsev et al., in Synthesis, 1971, 192; or with tert-butyl hydroperoxide and molybdenum (VI) as taught in United States Patent No, 4,691,015.<br>
More specifically, the instant process involves the reaction of a mixture of 5 to 100 moles of the alcohol of formula VI, 1 to 15 moles of hydrogen peroxide or organic hydroperoxide, and 0.001 to 0.5 moles of metal salt or metal-ligand complex per mole of N-oxyl compound of formula V. The reaction is preferably carried out at a temperature in the range of 20' to lOO'C.<br>
The alcohol may serve two functions both as reactant and as solvent for the reaction. A mixture of products may result if the alcohol contains non-equivalent carbon-hydrogen bonds which are reactive in the instant process. For example, tert-butyl alcohol can give only one product whereas tert-amyl alcohol can give three distinct reaction products. A cosolvent may be used if the alcohol is a solid at the temperature of the reaction or if the metal salt or metal-ligand complex is not very soluble in the alcohol. Typical cosolvents are water, methanol and ethylene glycol.<br>
The instant process mainly uses a less than stoichiometric amount, based on peroxide, of a transition metal salt or a metal-ligand complex with the metal chosen from groups IVA, VA, VIIA, VIIIA or IB (transition metals, metals of lowest weight in these groups being Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) of the periodic table. Iron(ll), iron(lll), copper(l) and copper(ll) are the most effective catalysts. The metal may be in the form of a simple salt such as a metal chloride or sulfate, a metal salt of an organic acid such as acetic acid, or a metal oxide which may also contain a cation from group IA or IIA of the periodic table, such as sodium metavanadate. The metal may also be complexed with a ligand such as 2,2'-dipyridyl, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or its disodium salt, triphenylphosphine oxide, or the anion of acetylacetone. These metal ligand complexes are items of commerce or may be formed in situ by mixing a metal salt with the ligand. The amount of ligand may be less than the amount required to completely complex the metal based on its oxidation state. The metal salt or metal-ligand complex may be bound to a solid support such as silica gel so that it can be<br><br>
recovered and reused.<br>
A mineral acid or sulfonic acid may be added to the reaction mixture in an amount corresponding to up to one mole per mole of nitroxyl moiety.<br>
The instant process can be run in air or in an inert atmosphere such a nitrogen or argon.<br>
There are several variations of the instant process. One variation involves the addition of a solution of aqueous hydrogen peroxide or organic hydroperoxide to a mixture of the N-oxyl hindered amine, the alcohol and cosolvent (if used) and acid (if used), and metal salt or metal-ligand complex which has been brought to the desired temperature for reaction. The proper temperature is maintained by controlling the rate of peroxide addition and/or by using a heating or cooling bath. After the peroxide is added, the reaction mixture is stirred till the starting N-oxyl compound of formula V has disappeared or is no longer being converted to the compound of formula IV. The reaction is best monitored by thin layer chromatography, gas chromatography or liquid chromatography. Additional portions of metal salt or metal-ligand complex can be added while the reaction is in progress. After the initial peroxide charge has been added to the reaction mixture, more peroxide can be added dropwise to bring the reaction to completion.<br>
A second variation of the instant process is to simultaneously add separate solutions of the peroxide and the nitroxyl compound to a mixture of the alcohol, cosolvent (if used), acid (if used) and metal salt or metal-ligand complex. The nitroxyl compound may be dissolved in water or the alcohol solvent used in the reaction. Some of the nitroxyl compound may be introduced into the reaction mixture prior to starting the peroxide addition, and all of the nitroxyl compound should be added prior to completing the peroxide addition.<br>
Another variation of the instant process involves the simultaneous addition of separate solutions of the peroxide and of the aqueous or alcohol solution of the metal salt or metal-ligand complex to a mixture of the nitroxyl compound, alcohol, cosolvent<br><br>
(if used), and acid (if used). Some of the metal may be introduced into the reaction mixture prior to starting the peroxide addition.<br>
Still another variation of the instant process is the simultaneous addition of separate solutions of the peroxide, of the aqueous or alcohol solution of the nitroxyl compound, and of an aqueous or alcohol solution of the metal salt or metal-ligand complex to the alcohol, cosolvent (if used) and acid (if used). A portion of the nitroxyl compound and/or metal salt or metal-ligand complex may be introduced into the reaction mixture prior to starting the peroxide addition. All of the nitroxyl compound should be added prior to completing the peroxide addition.<br>
If acid is used in the reaction, the acid may be added in one portion at the beginning of the reaction, or a portion of acid may be added at the beginning of the reaction and the remainder added while the reaction is in progress; or all of the acid may be added while the reaction is in progress. Some or all of the acid may be mixed with the metal salt if the metal salt is added as a solution while the reaction is in progress.<br>
If a metal-ligand complex is prepared in situ, the metal salt and ligand are most effectively mixed prior to contact with the nitroxyl compound.<br>
At the end of the reaction, the residual peroxide should be carefully decomposed prior to the isolation of any products.<br>

The compound of Example 73 present in test plaques NOR-2 specifically shows greatly improved gloss retention compared to the less effective control system and in fact is also more effective that a related hindered amine compound (TINUVIN' 123) present in test plaques NOR-1. Resistance to color change upon UV exposure is also enhanced.<br>
Polymer blends containing an unsaturated ternary component, such as EPDM blends, are especially benefited with the more efficient instant light stabilizer systems described above.<br>

Example 11<br>
Paintable TPO<br>
Molded test specimens are prepared by injection molding thermoplastic olefin (TPO) pellets containing the instant compounds, pigments and other coadditives as described in Example 76.<br>
The light stable formulations are painted with one-pack paint systems and tested for TPO/paint interactions. Before painting, the test specimens are first washed in accordance with GM998-4801 and dried for 15 minutes at 200Â°F (94'C). Adhesion promoter is applied to the dry film thickness of 0.2-0.4 mils. The samples are dried for five minutes before a 1K basecoat is applied to a film thickness of 1.2-1.4 mils. The painted panels are dried for three minutes, a clearcoat is then applied to a dry film thickness of 1.2-1.5 mils followed by ten minutes flash drying and a 30 minute oven bake at 250Â°F (121Â°C).<br>
Paint adhesion is measured by Aggressive Adhesion Testing (proprietary test procedure conducted at Technical Finishing, Inc.) and Taber Scuff. Painted panels which retain greater than 80% of the paint finish are considered acceptable. After Aggressive Adhesion Testing, samples with less than 5% paint loss are deemed acceptable.<br><br>
Samples are tested to evaluate the TPO/paint interactions as follows:<br><br>
		Aggresive	HALS<br>
Formulation*	Taber Scuff Test	Adfiesion Test	EKa<br>
A	100% removed	6% Loss (fail)	9.1<br>
B	0% removed	4% Loss (pass)	4.6<br>
C	0% removed	3% Loss (pass)	4.0<br>

9.1).<br>

calcium stearate and 750 ppm N,N-dialkylhydroxylamine in reactor-grade TPO.<br>
B also contains 0.2% of bis(1-octyloxy-2,2,6,6-teframethy(piperidin-4-yl) sebacate (TINUVINÂ®<br>
123, pKaOf4.6).<br>

piperidine (compound of Example 73, pKa of 4.0)<br>
The data in the table indicate that, although formulation A failed in both the Taber Scuff and Aggressive Adhesion Tests, both formulations B and C passed both paint adhesion tests. However, as inspection of the pKa values attests, the lower the pKa value (less basic) for the test hindered amine compound the less paint loss results in this Aggressive Adhesion Test. The instant compound of Example 73 having the hydroxyl moiety present has the lowest pKa value and also the least paint loss even better than the close prior art compound where no hydroxyl moiety is present.<br><br>

Typical film thickness of these various coatings are 0.1-0.3 mils for the adhesion promoter, 0.6-0.8 mils for the base coat, and 1.2-1.5 mils for the clear coat. After painting, the specimens are cured in an over at 120Â°C for 30 minutes.<br>
Samples are tested to evaluate the TPO/paint interactions as follows: In the initial adhesion test, a clear cellophane adhesive tape is used to pull on a 3 mm cross hatched paint surface or; in the humidity test, the painted plaques are exposed for 240 hours at 38Â°C in an atmosphere having 98% relative humidity. The blister rating is tested by visual observation according to ASTM D 714.<br>

Example 110<br>
Coatings over Plastic Substrates<br><br>
A major application for non-basic hindered amines is in the protection of automotive topcoats applied over plastic substrates. However, many low molecular weight, non-reactable light stabilizers migrate into the plastic substrate during drying and cure. As a consequence, a significant portion of the light stabilizer may be lost from the topcoat into the substrate and hence be ineffective in protecting said topcoat.<br>
The extent of migration of hindered amine stabilizers during application and cure of the coating is determined by comparing the concentration of hindered amine in the cured clearcoat applied over a plastic substrate versus the same clearcoat applied over a non-permeable substrate such as glass or steel.<br>
Hindered amine stabilizers under test are incorporated into a flexible thermoset acrylic/melamine clear coating appropriate for use on automotive plastic substrates. The hindered amine is incorporated at a level of 1.5% by weight based on total resins solids.<br>
Each coating formulation is applied by an automatic spray appratus onto automotive grade RIM (Reacting Injection Molded) substrate and TPO (thermoplastic polyolefin). Both substrates are in form of 4" x 12" plaques. Each coating is applied to achieve a dry film thickness of approximately 2.0 mils (50 microns). The coatings are cured by baking at 250*'F (121Â°C) for 20 minutes.<br>
Triplicate samples of each cured coating formulation are removed from each substrate and cryoground to a fine powder. A known amount of each sample is extracted in refluxing toluene overnight. The hindered amine present is analyzed quantitatively by dilution to a known volume and analyzed by HPLC or SFC chromatography. Calibration curves for each test stabilizer compound are developed. The hindered amine content of each extracted coating is determined by this method.<br>
When the instant hindered amine compounds substituted on the N-atom with an -0-E-OH moiety are compared to the corresponding -NOR compounds lacking such a hydroxyl moiety, a higher percent recovery of the instant hindered amine compound from the clearcoat over a plastic substrate is found indicating that much less of the instant hindered amine<br><br>
stabilizer migrates into the plastic substrate allowing for better stabilization of the clear topcoat over such plastic substrates.<br>
Example 111<br>
Stabilization of Waterborne Wood Varnish<br>
Waterborne coating comprise a significant and increasing proportion of the coating in use for a wide variety of applications including automotive basecoats, industrial coatings and trade sale coatings. These coatings may be pigmented or transparent. The trends are also towards higher solids formulation which in general depend on light stabilizers to maintain properties on exterior exposure, and towards lower levels of cosolvents. This requires higher solubility of stabilizers in such cosolvents (primarily water) or actual solubility in water.<br>
The test stabilizers are incorporated into a waterborne dispersion by predissolution in a cosolvent blend. The waterborne dispersion is a commercially available acrylic/urethane hydrid resin. The cosolvent blend is a 1:1 mixture of TEXANOLÂ® (2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol, Texaco) and ARCOSOLVEÂ® TPM (tripropylene glycol methyl ether, AtlanticRlchfield).<br>
0.45 gram of the test stabilizer is predissolved in 10 g of the cosolvent blend which is then incorporated into the following composition:<br><br><br>
Each coating is brush applied onto 6" x 6" sections of cedar and pine boards. The weight of the coating applied is regulated by weighing the coating and brush before and after application and ensuring that the same weight of coating is applied to each section.<br>
The coated board sections are allowed to dry at ambient temperature for two weeks, then evaluated for visual appearance, gloss and Hunter L*. a* and b* color. The sections are exposed on racks at a 45Â° angle in South Florida for six months before being returned and evaluated for visual appearance, gloss, color change and any other signs of degradation or<br>
delamination.<br>
The instant hindered amine compounds substituted on the N-atom with an -0-E-OH moiety provide better stabilization efficacy to the sections in respect to visual appearance, gloss retention, resistance to color change and to delamination than do the corresponding -NOR compounds lacking such a hydroxyl moiety.<br>
Example 112<br>
Stabilization of Pigmented Automotive OEM Basecoat<br>
A basecoat pigmented with a mixture of Pigment Red 177 and mica is stabilized with 1% by weight of a hindered amine stabilizer based on the total basecoat solids (pigment plus resin). The basecoat is spray applied at a dry film thickness of 1 mil (25 microns) to primed 4" x 12" steel panels, then topcoated with a high solids commercially available automotive clearcoat. The coated panels are cured in an over at 250*'F (121Â°C) for 30 minutes. The panels are then exposed in a Xenon-Arc Weather-Ometer under the following conditions:<br>
Cam 180 cycle: 40 minutes light only; 20 minutes light and front spray; 60 minutes light only; 60 minutes dark and rear spray condensate.<br>
Lamp filters are: quartz inner/borosilicate S outer.<br>
Irradiance: 0.55 watts per square meter.<br><br>
20" Gloss, Distinctness of Image, Hunter Color Space Values (L*, a*, b* and AE) are measured before exposure and after 3000 hours of exposure.<br>
The instant hindered amine compounds substituted on the N-atom with an -0-E-OH moiety provide better stabilization efficacy to the panels in respect to distinctness of image, gloss retention and resistance to color change than do the corresponding -NOR compounds lacking such a hydroxyl moiety.<br>
Example 113 ABS Molding Applications<br>
Thermoplastic materials composed of mixtures of copolymers derived from the copolymerization of styrene monomer with acrylonitrile and the copolymerization of stryrene monomer with butadiene, generally referred to as ABS, are dry blended with the instant compounds and melt compounded into pellets. Typical formulations contain the instant compounds at levels from 0.05% to 2.0%, a metal stearate such as calcium stearate at 0.05% to 0.5%, pigments from 0% to 5%, UV absorbers at levels of 0.05% to 2.0%, phosphites at 0.0% -0.1%, phenolic antioxidants at 0.0% -1.25%, N,N-dialkylhydroxylamine at 0.0% - 0,1%, and optionally other hindered amine stabilizers at levels of 0.0% to 2.0%.<br>
The pelletized fully formulated resin is then processed into a useful article such as extrusion into sheet, film, profile and pipe ; molded into bottles; injection molded into a molded article; thermoformed into molded articles; or rotational molded into hollow articles.<br>
The materials containing the instant compounds exhibit stability against deleterious effects of UV light and thermal exposure.<br>
Example 114<br><br>
pKa Values<br>
In order to determine the pKa values of water insoluble materials, organic references with known pKa values in water are titrated non-aqueously. A plot of the half neutralization potential (HNP) versus the known aqueous pKa value of the reference material is establed. The HNP of the test material is determined and extrapolated to find the corresponding pKa value of the test material. Such organic reference materials include 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine; 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine; 1-hydroxyethyl-4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine; triacetoneamine and N-methylaniline.<br>
The reference materials, which are structurally at least peripherally related to the instant test materials and are soluble in both water and 1:1 acetonitrile:chloroform, are used to make a calibration plot in the non-aqueous titration (1:1 acetonitrile:chloroform solvent and 0.1 N perchloric acid/dioxane titrant) system. Approximately 0.5 mill)equivalents of test material is weighed into a titration beaker. Thirty mL of acetonitrile is added to dissolve the sample. Prior to titration, 30 mL of chloroform is added. Titration is carried out and the HNP is determined. The electrolyte for the reference electrode is 2-(aminomethylpyridine. The electrode is allowed to stand in the solvent system for two hours after filling with the electrolyte to achieve equilibration. All samples are run in duplicate. The pKa values are seen in the table below.<br><br>

VI	is the reaction product of 2,4-bis[N-(1-cyclohexyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl)butyl-amino] -G-chloro-s-triazine with N,N'-bis(3-aminopropyl)ethylenediamine.<br>
As can be seen from each of the above pairs of related compounds where the individual compounds differ from the other only by whether the 1-position of the piperidine ring is substituted by an -0-R group or by an -0-E-OH, the instant -0-E-OH compounds consisting have a significantly lower pKa value meaning that said instant compounds are distinguished by consistently lower basicity than the prior art N-OR compounds.<br>
Inspection of the results given in Example 77 shows that this lower basicity and lower pKa values can be translated into superior performance for the instant compounds compared to the closely related prior art N-OR compounds in preventing paint loss on paintable thermoplastic polyolefins (TPO).<br>

Stabilization of Tung Oil Phenolic Varnish<br>
Pieces of 1.27 cm x 20.32 cm x 30.48 cm western red cedar panels having a fine radial cut are used to test a commercially available tung oil phenolic varish (supplied by McCloskey). One half of each panel is coated with two coats of unstabilized varnish. An equal amount of varnish containing 5% by weight (based on resin solids) of test stabilizers is applied to the other half of the panel in two coats. After storage for two weeks at ambient temperature, the wood panels are exposed outdoors at an angle of 45*' S for a period of eight months. The 60*' gloss of each half of the panel is measured at the top, middle and bottom portion of the panel and averaged according to ASTM D 523. Due to the lack of homogeneity of wood substrates, the gloss retention of the same varnish tends to differ slightly from panel to panel. Thus, the application of an unstabilized control varnish to every panel allows for a more meaningful measurement of the improvement in gloss due to the presence of the instant test compound.<br>
The panels stabilized by the instant compounds show excellent gloss retention after long exposure.<br><br>

After ambient storage for two weeks, three panels of each formulation are exposed outdoors at an angle of 45Â° S for a period of nine months. Thereafter, 20Â° gloss retention is determined by ASTM D 523-80 at the top, middle and bottom portions of each panel.

Electrocoat Composition<br>
A typical E-coat composition is prepared by adding the diglyicidyl ether of bisphenol A, polyethylene oxide diol, bisphenol A and xylene to a flask and heating to 135'C. The catalyst dimethyibenzylamine in xylene is added and the temperature maintained at 143*'C for two hours. The weight per epoxy (WPE) is measured and a previously prepared crosslinker composed of 2,4-toluenediisocyanate, trimethylolpropane blocked with an alcohol is then added and temperature reduced to 100Â°C. The remaining epoxy groups are then capped with two different secondary amines, namely diketimine of diethylenetriamine and methylethanolamine, in phenyl cellosolve. The temperature is maintained for one hour at 110Â°C and the crosslinker hexa-methylenediisocyanate blocked with an alcohol is added. The temperature is maintained near 100Â°C for 30 minutes and the resin mixture is added to deionized water, surfactant and lactic acid to give a resin emulsion.<br>
To this resin emulsion is added the instant hindered amine compound, additional epoxy resin, carbon black, dibutyltin oxide catalyst, titanium dioxide, lead silicate, water and UV<br><br>
absorber. After dispersion using a sand mill to achieve proper fineness, the mixture is incorporated into an electrocoat bath with water for electrocoating onto a metal substrate.<br>
The steel coating electrocoated with the above E-coat resin composition to a thickness of 23-30 |Lim and cured for 20 minutes at a temperature of 176-201 *'C. A pigmented resin layer is coated thereover at a thickness of 20-51 jiim using an acrylic coating composition in an organic solver, pigments and a UV absorber. The coated panels are then baked at 121-129Â°C to cure the pigmented layer.<br>
The panels are then exposed outdoors for four months. The panels containing the instant hindered amine compound, particularly when used with a UV absorber, provided excellent resistance to delamination of the E-coat layer from the metal substrate.<br>

Plaques of polycarbonate-based plastic substrate (Xenoy) 4" x 6" are coated with the formulated clear coat at a thickness of approximately 1.5 mils. The coating is spray applied to the substrate and then baked at 82Â°C for 20 minutes.<br>
After storage for one week at room temperature, each plaque is cut into 2" x 3" strips with five replicates being made for each formulation. Each strip is placed into a 8-oz jar along with 2 mL of distilled water and sealed. All samples are placed in an over at 54Â°C. A Crosshatch adhesion test is performed once a week on at least two of the replicate samples until the sample failed (5% adhesion loss) or until 40 days elapses.<br>

Stabilization of a Glycidyl Methacrylate-based Powder Clearcoat<br>
One of the major new coating technologies which can be used to meet increasingly stringent VOC solvent emission requirements is the use of powder coatings. Applications requiring the use of light stabilizers include clearcoats for finishing of automotive topcoats, finishing of garden implements, protection of automotive wheel covers. For optimum incorporation and shelf stability, stabilizers used in a powder coating should be moderate-melting (-100Â° C) solids, nonvolatile, and heat stable at typical powder coating baking temperatures (140-180Â° C).<br>
Prior to incorporation of the Hindered Amine Light Stabilizers under test, a premix of commercially available GMA-based powder coating resin, UV absorber, and flow aids is made by extruding together at 145Â° C. The Hindered Amine Light Stabilizers under test are then incorporated into portions of this premix, along with a commercially available 1,12 dodecanoic acid crosslinking resin. The final mix is extruded at 100Â° C, then the extrudate is milled on an ultracentrifugal mill and powder cyclone, and sieved. The powders are electrostatically sprayed onto a basecoat to a film thickness of 60 microns. The coatings are cured for 30 minutes at 160Â° C.<br>

Performed Films for Lamination to plastic parts<br>
The instant invention also pertains to protective and decorative films which are performed, then applied to a substrate via a dry paint transfer process. These films consist of a single decorative layer which is applied to a carrier sheet, then laminated to a self-supporting, thermoformable backing sheet. The carrier sheet is then removed from the opposite side of the film, exposing the decorative layer. The composite film/backing sheet then is thermoformed to a three-dimensional shape. Additionally, these films may also consist of multiple layers, where, for example, a thermoplastic, thermoformable clearcoat is applied to the carrier sheet, then hardened to form an optically clear film. A color coat is then applied to the exposed face of the clearcoat, and hardened, resulting in a clear coat/color coat paint film supported by the carrier. This composite is then laminated to a thermoformable backing sheet, as above. The carrier sheet is removed, as above, and the composite clearcoat/colorcoat/backing is then thermoformed, as above.<br>
