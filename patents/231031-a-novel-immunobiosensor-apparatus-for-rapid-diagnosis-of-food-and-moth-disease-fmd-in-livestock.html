				<td>FIELD  OF   INVENTION	<br>
The     invention   relates  to  a  novel   immunobiosensor     apparatus<br><br>
agnosiS  Of  Foot  And  Mouth<br><br>
Disease (FMD)in livestockin particular	to an apparatus for diagnosis of FMD<br><br>
in  livestocks with  indication  to  the  exact  type  of  virus involved. PRIOR ART<br>
The control of FMD in livestocks in India is mainly through early diagnosis and regular vaccination. Previously the diagnosis of FMD was carried out using the complement fixation test (CFT) but Enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA), is now the test of choice. ELISA takes about 4 - 6 h which is a long time when there is a case of FMD to be diagnosed. This has led to the search for an alternative test/technique which is effiecient and fast.<br>
Biosensors are being used in different diagnostic tests with rapid results, which are specific and sensitive.<br>
Biosensors basically have two componentsi biological or sensor molecules and a signal transducer. The biological component consists of an antigen or antibody. The transducer det'ects the change in one or more physicochemical property of the biological molecule. Hence, increasing attention is being paid to the development of the immunobiosensors especially those that can be used to assay clinical samples (Alder and McCallum, 1983|<br><br>
Guilbault and Jordan, 1988; Ngeh-Ngwainbl et al. 1990; Konig and Bratzel, 1993 and 1999; Aberl et al. 1994; Morgan et al. 1996). The most commonly used biosensors are the Piezo electric (PZ) crystal, immunoelectrode and optic fiber biosensors. The piezoelectric phenomenon was discovered in 1880 whereby electric dipoles generated in an isotropic natural crystals were subjected to mechanical stress, thus causing them to oscillate at frequencies between 9 and 14 MHz (Morgan et al., 1996). Quartz is the most commonly used piezoelectric material because of its chemical stability in aqueous solutions and resistance to high temperatures without loss of piezoelectric properties. These sensors are constructed by immobilizing a selective binding surface to a transducer. The surface can be an immobilized antigen or antibody against a specific antibody or antigen, respectively. Selective binding of the molecule to the absorptive surface causes the transducer to change one or more of its fundamental signals. The PZ quartz crystal is one such<br>
•i,	^<br>
transducer and the crystal oscillates at a very specific resonant frequency when placed in an appropriate oscillator circuit. In PZ biosensors, the crystals are coated with an adsorbent that selectively interacts with the analyte of interest; subsequent being increases the mass of the coated crystal and alters its frequency of oscillation. The PZ crystal oscillator can be used<br><br>
as a micro-balance to detect a change in mass of the crystal  due<br>
to the formation of antigen-antibody complex, thus permitting  it<br>
to be  utilized  as  an immunobiosensor).   The  working of  an<br>
immunobiosensor can generally be described whereby the electrodes<br>
are  placed on opposite faces of a PZ crystal and if a potential<br>
is  applied between these electrodes, forces will be  exerted on<br>
the   bound  charges  within  the  crystal  and   the   resultant<br>
deformation  within the srystal form an electromechanical  system<br>
which will be vibrated, when properly excited.  PZ crystals used<br>
in  oscillators normally-have silver or gold electrodes placed on<br>
opposite faces with leads for electrical connections.   Examining<br>
the  cost effectiveness, ease of performance, and feasibility of<br>
developing  it  into  a  field  oriented  test,  the  PZ  crystal<br>
biosensor was selected to be developed and standardized for rapid<br>
diagnosis of RID and typing the causative virus.<br>
Internationally and nationally the use of immunobiosensors are restricted to the diagnosis of doping in the field of sports. The application of the assay for the diagnosis have been tried for certain viral diseases of humans but by and large, it is EL ISA which is the test of choice in many diagnostic laboratories.<br><br>
OBJECTS QF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of thi» invention im to propose a novel immunobiosensor apparatus for the diagnosis of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) in livestocks, with an indication to the exact type of virus involved. Another object of this invention is to propose an immunobiosensor diagnosis kit for the diagnosis of FMD. SUMMARY QF_ THE INVENTION<br>
A novel immunobiosensor apparatus developed and standardized according to the invention for diagnosis of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) in livestocks with indication to the exact type of virus involved, comprisies a signal transducer capable of oscillating at a specific resonant frequency when connected to an osicillator circuit! a Transistor-Transistor Logie oscillator circuit (TTL) configured around said signal transducer, said circuit being supplied with 6V D.C. power supply from an external sourcei a plurality of electrodes placed on opposite faces of said signal transducer provided with a plurality of long leads; and a frequency counter to measure the output frequency of siad oscillator circuit, wherein a<br>
fundamental  frequency  (f1)  of  said  signal  transducer  being<br>
measured   by   connecting  said  oscillator  circuit   to  said<br>
transducer,  further  frequencies (f2 , f3 )  being  determined  on<br>
application of an antibody and an antigen on the surfaces of said<br><br>
transducer, said disease being diagnosed by evaluating the downward shift in mean resonance frequency (A f&gt; for immunoreaction and comparing the came with a standardised A*» charaterized in that said signal transducer is a 6 Mhz PZ crystal emerging as a frequency-determining element rtuseable for example, 6 to 8 times, said diagnosis requiring a time of 90-100 minutes, consumption per test of said antibody or said antigen being 2-5 µl, and said frequency counter providing mathematical value for exact typing of said virus. In accordance with the invention, the FMDV vaccine strains were<br>
grown  on  BHK 21   clone  13 monolayers.A  fraction  of  FMDV  was<br>
separated  by sucrose gradient ultracentrifuation.  This  antigen<br>
was  used  for  production of antisera  following  the  procedure described by Ferris (1988). PZ crystal resonator set-up<br>
A transistor-transistor logic (TTL) oscillator a configured around two gates of a SN 7414 IC and a quartz crystal, used as the frequency determining element, were assembled. A resistor was used to provide positive feed back from the output of the first gate to input. Two capacitors, one from input and another from output of the first gate were connected to the earth. This<br><br>
circuit worked as a free running oscillator locked to crystal frequency. The second gate merely acted as an inverting buffer to provide « measure of isolation of the first gate from the load connected to the output. Ik Ω resistor was used for the positive feed back. The capacitors used were 47 Pf and 68 Pf. One 6 MHz crystal was used as a frequency-determining element. This crystal was provided with two silver electrodes to which twolong leads were connected. The circuit was so assembled that the crystal could be easily connected and disconnected during the experiments. A DC power supply of 6 V was provided to the oscillator by an external source. The surface of the crystal was made available for immobilization. A scientific frequency counter was used to measure the frequency of output of the oscillator circuit.<br>
Immobilising antigen/antibody on PZ crysta1<br>
The  antibody against  FMDV was coated on a PZ  crystal by the<br>
following procedure.<br>
The  PZ  crystal was first washed with distilled water and  then<br>
dipped  in  ethanol.   The  crystal was  then  connected  to  the<br>
oscillator circuit  and the fundamental frequency  (f 1)  of  the<br>
crystal  was  recorded  using the frequency  meter.   The quartz<br>
crystal  was  then rinsed  with  phosphate-buffered  saline-Tween<br>
(PBST), pH 7.4.  After drying the crystal for 30 min at 37 º C,  1<br><br>
µl of antibody was pipetted on both the crystal surfaces using  a<br>
micropipette.   The crystal was washed with PBST, dried at 37  ºC,<br>
and  the frequency (f 2) recorded.  The crystal was then ready for<br>
immune  reaction.   Separate crystals were used for each of  the<br>
FMDV serotypes, viz., '0',  'A',  *C and Asia 1'. Development of PZ immunobiosensor<br>
One ul of antigen (tissue culture virus harvested a day prior  to<br>
the experiment with virus titer   10 5 TCID) was deposited on  the<br>
crystal.   The  crystal  was washed with PBST  and  dired  in  an<br>
incubator   at  37  º C.   After  drying,  the  frequency  of   the<br>
oscillation was recorded (f3).<br>
Standardization of the Protocol<br>
Selection  of the PZ crystal was carried out with PZ crystals  of<br>
various  frequencies utilising antibody of Asia 1 as a model  and<br>
3 tissue  culture  Asia  1 virus with a titre  of   10  TCID   as<br>
50 antigen.<br>
PZ crystal of 2,6 and 8 MHz were coated with the antibody and the assay was carried out.  The crystal were assessed for their  ease of handling and  repeatability of the assay. Determination of the positive response:  The negative or downward<br><br>
shift,Δf, for immunore*ction was determined by coating ten 6 MHz<br>
PZ  crystals  with antibody and reactd  with  hmomologous  tissue<br>
culture antigen dilutions ranging from neat to 10-9  .  The process<br>
was then repeated with monoclonal antibodies.<br>
Repeatability of the Assayt  The standardised assay was  repeated<br>
using  the same reagents viz., PBST, the tissue culture  antigen<br>
and the same crystal.  After every assay, the crystal was  washed<br>
thoroughly  and re-coated with the same FMDV type antobody.   The<br>
test  was carried out an each crystal  until  the  results were<br>
consistent.<br>
Specificity of  reaction:  Five crystals were coated  with  FMDV<br>
type  Asia 1 Antibody.  The assay was carried out with  different<br>
FMDV types as antigens and, for the fifth crystal, tissue culture<br>
medium was used as antigen.  Similar experiment was carried out<br>
by coating the Antibody against the FMDV serotypes.<br>
Self-life studies<br>
Four crystals were coated with polyclonal antibodies of FMDV type<br>
'0',   'A',  'C' and 'Asia 1', as per the standardised  protocol,<br>
in order to study the shelf life of the PZ crystal.  The crystals<br>
were  kept in a dry condition at room temperature.  The  resonant<br>
frequencies  of the crystals were measured at weekly intervals up<br><br>
to 18 weeks.<br>
Results<br>
Selection of the PZ immunobiosensor<br>
Sets of the crystals of known frequency were selected for testing<br>
and the mean resonant frequency obtained in each experiment.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>

(Table Removed)<br><br>
Table 3:  Results on standardisation of 8 Mhz PZ crystal for immunobiosensor<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
It was observed that the resonant frequency increases as the size of the crystal decreases. The 6 MHz crystal was convneient to handle and gave satisfactory results and was selected for further studies. The experiments using PZ crystals coated separately with antibodies against serotypes A, C and 0 of FMDV were carried out with with several tissue culture antigens. The results always showed a similar downward shift in the homologous system.<br>
It was found that the 6 MHz crystals were most suitable because they were not too thin to handle and the washing steps could be carried out without breaking them. Further more, the assay could be repeated without any significant variations. Thus the 6 MHz PZ crystals were selected for further standardisation.<br>
Determination to the positive response<br>
It  is found that up to the silution of 10-5   a mean  of -2.5  kHz<br>
emerged. Therefore, a mean Δ f of -2.5 kHz was taken as positive for diagnosis of FMDV.<br><br>
Results of the PZ immunobiosensor<br>
The  frequency after  antigen  exposure  was  higher  than  with<br>
antibody-coating  alone.  There was no downward  shift of  the<br>
frequency  to indicate a positive response.  Table 4 depicts  the<br>
result   of   the   frequency   changes   during   coating    and<br>
immunoreaction.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
The  result  of  frequency changes  during  coating  and  immune<br>
reaction  of a homologous system using tissue culture antigen  of<br>
titre   105 TCID50  , is shown in Table 3.<br>
Table 5:  Mean resonant frequency in kHz with homologous TC Ag sample<br>
 (Table Removed)<br>
It was observed that the downward frequency shift was always more than  2.5  kHz  in the homologous system  indicating  a  positive<br>
immune reaction.  The blank frequency (f1 ) was very close to  the<br><br><br>
resonant  frequency  of the crystal.  The frequency  (f 2  shifted<br>
downward* after antibody coating and when antigen was added.  The<br>
frequency  (f3 )  further shifted downwards in  the   case of  a<br>
homologous system (reaction of homologous antigen and  antibody).<br>
The time required to test one sample was approximately 90 min. This was further reduced to 60 min when antibody-coated crystals were prepared prior to the assaying. The resonant frequencies observed using the same crystal for repeated assays are shown in Table 6.<br>
Table   6:    Results  of  the  repeatability  of   PZ  crystal immunobiosensor in homologous system.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
It should be noted that the results were consistent up to the 8th assay and therefore inconsistent. This could be due to the wear and tear of the crystal surface. This reusability of the crystal minimises the cost of the assay.<br><br>
The specificity of the assay was established from the  expreiment results as depicted in Table 7.<br>
Table 7:  Mean resonant frequency of the PZ crystals to determine the specificity of the reaction.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
When an FMDV type Asia 1-coated crystal was allowed to react with other FMDV types. It should be noted that there was a downward shift in the resonant frequency by 2.5 kHz only when 'Asia 1 ' Antigen was used, which proves that the assay was specific. The assay was also compared with selected samples. It should be noted that the PZ crystal immunobiosensor could detect the antigen in all samples, including the one that was found negative by ELISA. It could also detect mixed viral infections of type '0' and 'Asia 1' in two outbreaks from vaccinated cows. (Gajendragad et al., 1999).<br>
Results on shelf-1ife studies of the coated PZ crystal There  was  no  change in the resonant  frequencies  recorded  at weekly intervalas shown in Table 8.<br><br>
Table  8:   Meann  resonant frequency in kHz of  the  crystals  at different times<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The crystals were used for immunoreaction with their respective antigens in which they showed downward shifts in resonance frequency indicating the formation of Ag-Ab complexes. Satisfactory immunoreactions could be conducted for up to 18 weeks.)<br>
The  invention  is  explained in more details  hereinbelow with reference to the accompanying figures. In detaili<br>

Fig.   2     Shows a protocol of the PZ crystal immunobiosensor, Fig.   3    Shows graphical determination of the cut-off point for the PZ crystal of immunobiosensor,<br>
A transistor-transistor logic oscillator (Fig. 1) was constructed to cause the selected signal transducer in the form of Pietoelectric crystal to oscillator at a specific resonant frequency under mechanical stress being generated by electric dipoltmt when the crystal is placed on the oscillator circuit provided with power supply from an external source. A secientific frequency counter connected to the oscillator circuit measuring the oscillating frequency of the crystal.<br>
The PZ crystal used for the apparatus was selected and standardized after repeated determination of the mean resonant frequency of a plurality of crystals of different denomination<br>
for  example, 2 MH z, 6 MHz  and 8 Mhz .  The experiment  each  time<br>
was carried out using  PZ crystals coated  separately  with<br>
antibodies against serotype of FMDV with plurality tissue culture<br>
antigens.   The 6 MH PZ crystal was then selected for the novel<br>
z apparatus being free of significant variations and being convient<br>
from  useability  point of view.  The  shelf-life  of	different<br>
crystals of different sizes were  also studied through	measuring<br>
the  resonant  frequencies of the crystals at  weekly	intervals.<br>
Results of standardisation of PZ crystals are depicted	in figures<br><br>
3 to 5.  It is observed that a similar downward shift in resonant<br>
frequency  occurs in the case of selected crystal (6 MHz ) in  the<br>
homologous system.<br>
Determination  of the positive response was carried-out  through repeated  evaluation of the negative or downward shift (  f)  for<br>
immunoreaction using plurality of 6 MHz PZ crystals with antibody<br>
reacted  with  antigen of various dilutions.  It  is  ascertained<br>
from  the graphical representation (Fig. 6) of the  results  that<br><br>
upto  the dilution of 10 -5 , a mean Δf of -2.5 kH  indicates  the<br>
positive diagnosis of FMDV (Fig.-6).<br>
The immunobiosensor are constructed by immobilising antibody against FMDV coated on the selected and standardised signal transducer. The blank PZ crystal was washed with distilled water and then dipped in ethanol. The fundamental frequency<br>
(f1 )  of the blank crystal was then recorded  in  the   frequency<br>
counter by placing the crystal on the oscillator circuit.   The<br>
crystal was then dis-engaged from the oscillator circuit and rinsed with PBBT and dried in an incubator. Antibody was coated<br>
on  the crystal, washed and dried before the frequency  (f2 )  was<br>
further  recorded  on re-engaing the crystal  on  the  oscillator<br>
circuit. The crystal was then ready for immunoreaction for which antigen was deposited on the crystal. The crystal was further washed with PBST and dried in the incubator before being placed<br>
for  measuring the frequency (f3 ).  The downward shift (Δf)  in<br>
the  resonant  frequency when ascertained  above  a  standardised<br>
negative shift, a positive result is established.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
