The present invention relates to a process for obtaining C5 fraction enriched with isoprene.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for obtaining, from a fluid catalytically cracked C5 fraction, a C5 fraction which is enriched with isoprene and purified which is usable to form a medium for the selective polymerisation of isoprene. The invention also relates to a process for obtaining an isoprene homopolymer having in particular a high cis-1,4 linkage content and inherent viscosity, from a polymerisation medium comprising isoprene and at least one methyl butane, such as said fluid catalytically cracked C5 fraction which is enriched with isoprene and purified.<br>
Fluid catalytically cracked C5 fractions (also referred to as C5 fractions of fluid catalytically cracked light gasolines, or abbreviated to "F.C.C." fractions for "fluid catalytic cracking", in English) usually contain isoprene in a mass fraction of less than 1%. Furthermore, they contain essentially:<br>
-	in a mass fraction typically of between 40% and 65%, mono-olefins comprising, on one hand, α4-olefms such as 1-butene, 3-methyf 1-butene, 1-pentene, 2-methyl 1-butene and, on the other hand, ß-olefins such as 2-butene, 2-pentene and 2-methyl-2-butene;<br>
-	in a mass fraction typically of between 55% and 30%, alkanes comprising isopentane in a majority proportion and n-pentane in a minority proportion, and<br>
-	in a mass fraction typically of less than 1%, dienes such as cyclopentadiene, 1,3-pentadiene and 1,4-pentadiene, and other compounds such as acetylene compounds.<br>
These'fluid catalytically cracked C5 fractions must in particular not be confused with steam-cracked C5 naphtha fractions, which typically contain isoprene in a mass fraction ranging from 10% to 30%, mono-olefins (oc-olefins and (3-olefins) in a mass fraction ranging from 20% to 40%, dienes such as cyclopentadiene and pentadienes in a mass fraction ranging from 20% to 30%, and, in a minority proportion, alkanes, limonene and acetyienic and aromatic compounds.<br><br><br>
In order to be able to effect selective polymerisation of isoprene with high activity from such a steam-cracked C5 naphtha fraction, the latter must first be enriched with isoprene so that the mass fraction of isoprene in the enriched fraction is close to 100%, because it turns out that the other aforementioned compounds adversely affect the yield of the isoprene polymerisation reaction. In particular, this enriched fraction must be practically devoid of cyclopentadiene, which is a poison to catalytic systems.<br>
International patent specification WO-A-02/48218 in the name of the Applicants discloses a process for obtaining a polyisoprene having a very high cis-1,4 linkage content from such a steam-cracked C5 naphtha fraction enriched with isoprene, this process consisting essentially of reacting a catalytic system in the presence of the enriched C5 fraction such that the mass fraction of isoprene in the enriched fraction varies surprisingly from 30% to 95% only.<br>
This catalytic system is based on a conjugated diene monomer, a rare earth salt of an organic phosphoric acid suspended in a saturated, inert hydrocarbon solvent which is of aliphatic or alicyclic type, an alkylating agent consisting of an alkylaluminium of formula AIR3 or HAIR;, in which Al represents the aluminium atom, H represents a hydrogen atom and R represents a hydrocarbon radical, in a molar ratio (alkylating agent : rare earth salt) varying from 1 to 5, and a halogen donor consisting of an alkylaluminium halide.<br>
In order to be able to effect selective polymerisation of isoprene with high activity from a fluid catalytically cracked C5 fraction, this C5 fraction must also be enriched with isoprene so that the mass fraction of isoprene in the enriched fraction is close to 100%, typically greater than 99%, because it turns out that certain compounds of this enriched C5 fraction, such as the methyl butenes, adversely affect the yield of the isoprene polymerisation reaction. Furthermore, the enriched fraction must be practically devoid of 1,3- and 1,4-pentadiene, which are known to impair the polymerisation kinetics of the isoprene compared with that of isoprene taken in isolation.<br>
In known manner, a mass fraction of isoprene of close to 100% in a fluid catalytically cracked C5 fraction may be obtained, in a first stage, by decomposition of an amyl ether obtained by reaction of an alcohol with this C5 fraction in order to obtain a mass fraction of methyl butenes of close to 100% in the C5 fraction thus treated and purified, then, in a second stage, by oxidative dehydrogenation of the methyl butenes to isoprene. Reference will be<br><br>
made to patent specification FR-A-2 782 996 for the description of this enrichment of an "F.C.C." C5 fraction with isoprene.<br>
One major disadvantage of the known processes of selective polymerisation of isoprene from a fluid catalytically cracked C5 fraction lies in the necessity of considerably enriching this C5 fraction with isoprene via a complex enrichment process such as the one mentioned above with reference to document FR-A-2 782 996 and, consequently, of involving a relatively high overall operating cost for this polymerisation.<br>
The object of the present invention is to overcome this drawback, and it is achieved in that the Applicants have surprisingly discovered that a catalytic system based on:<br>
-	at least one conjugated diene monomer,<br>
-	a salt of one or more rare earth metals (metals having an atomic number of between<br>
57 and 71 in the periodic table) of an organic phosphoric acid,<br>
-	an alkylating agent consisting of an alkylaluminium of formula A1R3 or HAIRa, in<br>
which Al represents the aluminium atom, H represents a hydrogen atom, the radicals R, which<br>
may be identical or different, and straight-chain or branched, represent hydrocarbon groups<br>
having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, and<br>
-	a halogen donor consisting of an alkylaluminium halide,<br>
said salt being suspended in at least one saturated inert hydrocarbon solvent of aliphatic or alicyclic type which is included in said catalytic system, and the molar ratio (alkylating agent: rare earth salt) being in a range of from 1 to 5,<br>
permits the selective polymerisation of isoprene with high catalytic activity to obtain a polyisoprene having a high cis-1,4 linkage content, from a fluid catalytically cracked initial C5 fraction which has been only slightly enriched with isoprene, such that the mass fraction of isoprene in the enriched and purified final C5 fraction is less than 30%, and advantageously less than or equal to 10%.<br>
This possibility of homopolymerising isoprene from this purified final C5 fraction, which is only very slightly enriched with isoprene, results in a simplification of the operation of enriching the initial C5 fraction and, consequently, a substantial reduction in the overall cost of obtaining polyisoprenes from said initial C5 fraction.<br><br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, a process for obtaining said final C5 fraction which is enriched with isoprene and purified which is usable to form a medium for the selective polymerisation of isoprene in the presence of said catalytic system, from said fluid catalytically cracked initial C5 fraction, comprises:<br>
dehydrogenation which is applied to an intermediate C5 fraction, comprising methyl butenes and resulting from said initial C5 fraction, and which produces said final C5 fraction,<br>
purification of said final C5 fraction thus obtained to obtain said purified final C5 fraction which is practically devoid of disubstituted alkynes, true alkynes (including vinylacetylenes) and cyclopentadiene,<br>
and this process for obtaining said purified final C5 fraction is such that the mass fraction of said methyl butenes in said intermediate C5 fraction is less than 30%.<br>
Advantageously, the mass fraction of said methyl butenes in said intermediate C5 fraction is less than or equal to 20%.<br>
It will be noted that this mass fraction of the methyl butenes in this intermediate C5 fraction (i.e. before dehydrogenation) is extremely reduced compared with the mass fractions of methyl butenes close to 100% which characterise the C5 fractions before dehydrogenation which are used in the known processes for enrichment with isoprene of the fluid catalytically cracked fractions, for the selective polymerisation of isoprene with a high yield in order to obtain a polyisoprene having a high cis-1,4 linkage content.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, said intermediate C5 fraction is depleted in n-pentenes such that it comprises said n-pentenes in a mass fraction of less than<br>
It will be noted that this depletion in n-pentenes of the intermediate C5 fraction (precursors of the 1,3- and 1,4-pentadienes) makes it possible practically to eliminate these 1,3- and 1,4-pentadienes from the final C5 fraction.<br>
In fact, according to another aspect of the invention, the final C5 fraction comprises 1,3-pentadiene and 1,4-pentadiene in mass ratios (1,3-pentadiene : isoprene) and (1,4-pentadiene : isoprene) which must be less than or equal to 0.5% and 0.2%, respectively, to be able to polymerise isoprene selectively from this final fraction with satisfactory conversion kinetics which are close to those relating to the isolated polymerisation of isoprene<br><br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, a process for obtaining said final C5 fraction which is enriched with isoprene and purified which is usable to form a medium for the selective polymerisation of isoprene in the presence of said catalytic system, from said fluid catalytically cracked initial C5 fraction, comprises:<br>
dehydrogenation which is applied to an intermediate C5 fraction, comprising methyl butenes and resulting from said initial C5 fraction, and which produces said final C5 fraction,<br>
-    purification of said final C5 fraction thus obtained to obtain said purified final C5<br>
fraction which is practically devoid of disubstituted alkynes, terminal alkynes (including vinylacetylenes) and cyclopentadiene,<br>
and this process for obtaining said purified final C5 fraction is such that the mass fraction of said methyl butenes in said intermediate C5 fraction is less than 30%.<br>
Advantageously, the mass fraction of said methyl butenes in said intermediate C5 fraction is less than or equal to 20%.<br>
It will be noted that this mass fraction of the methyl butenes in this intermediate C5 fraction (i.e. before dehydrogenation) is extremely reduced compared with the mass fractions of methyl butenes close to 100% which characterise the C5 fractions before dehydrogenation which are used in the known processes for enrichment with isoprene of the fluid catalytically cracked fractions, for the selective polymerisation of isoprene with a high yield in order to obtain a polyisoprene having a high cis-1,4 linkage content.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, said intermediate C5 fraction is - deplete in n-cpentence such that it comprises said n-pentenes in a mass fraction of less than 0.1% .0.1%.<br>
It will be noted that this depletion in n-pentenes of the intermediate C5 fraction (precursors of the 1,3- and 1,4-pentadienes) makes it possible practically to eliminate these 1,3- and 1,4-pentadienes from the final C5 fraction.<br>
In fact, according to another aspect of the invention, the final C5 fraction comprises 1,3-pentadiene and 1,4-pentadiene in mass ratios (1,3-pentadiene : isoprene) and (1,4-pentadiene : isoprene) which must be less than or equal to 0.5% and 0.2%, respectively, to be able to polymerise isoprene selectively from this final fraction with satisfactory conversion kinetics which are close to those relating to the isolated polymerisation of isoprene<br>
 The subject of the present invention is also a process for obtaining an isoprene homopolymer having a cis-1,4 linkage content equal to or greater than 98.0%, which is such that it comprises the reaction of said catalytic system according to the invention in a polymerisation medium comprising isoprene and at least one methyl butene, such that the mass ratio (methyl butene(s) : isoprene) is equal to or greater than 50% and advantageously equal to or greater than 100%.<br>
It will be noted that this polymerisation reaction can be implemented in an inert hydrocarbon solvent, or alternatively without a solvent.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention relating to this process for obtaining an isoprene homopolymer, the polymerisation medium comprises at least one mono-olefin and the mass ratio (mono-olefm(s): isoprene) is greater than 50% in this polymerisation medium.<br>
According to one preferred characteristic of this process for obtaining an isoprene homopolymer according to the invention, said methyl butenes comprise 2-methyl 2-butene.<br>
Even more preferably, the mass ratio (2-methyl 2-butene : isoprene) in said polymerisation medium is equal to or greater than 20% and, even more preferably, equal to or greater than 50%.<br>
It will be noted that the fluid catalytically cracked C5 fractions and said purified final C5 fractions according to the present invention which result therefrom are characterised in that they always comprise 2-methyl 2-butene.<br>
Even more preferably, said methyl butenes comprise at least 2-methyl 1-butene and 2-methyl 2-butene, the mass ratio (2-methyl 1-butene : isoprene) and the mass ratio (2-methyl 2-butene : isoprene) each being of between 20 and 60%.<br>
According to another aspect of this process for obtaining an isoprene homopolymer according to the invention, the mass fraction of isoprene in said polymerisation medium is less than 30% and advantageously less than or equal to 10%.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of this process for obtaining an isoprene homopolymer according to the invention, said process comprises the following stages:<br>
(i) obtaining, from a fluid catalytically cracked initial C5 fraction, an intermediate C5 fraction comprising methyl butenes in a mass fraction of less than 30% and advantageously less than or equal to 20%,<br><br>
(ii) obtaining a final C5 fraction which is enriched with isoprene and purified, usable to form a medium for the selective polymerisation of isoprene in the presence of said catalytic system, by dehydrogenation applied to said intermediate C5 fraction, and<br>
(iii) obtaining said isoprene homopolymer by reacting said enriched and purified final C5 fraction with said catalytic system.<br>
According to another aspect of this preferred embodiment in which said polymerisation medium is formed by said purified final C5 fraction, the mass ratio (mono-olefin(s): isoprene) is greater than 50% in this polymerisation medium.<br>
According to another characteristic of this preferred embodiment, said stage (i) comprises a catalytic hydrogenation, such as a catalytic hydrogenation by means of a palladium-based catalyst.<br>
According to another aspect of this preferred embodiment, said intermediate C5 fraction is depleted in n-pentenes such that it comprises said n-pentenes in a mass fraction of less than 0.1%, and said final C5 fraction comprises 1,3-pentadiene and 1,4-pentadiene in mass ratios (1,3-pentadiene : isoprene) and (1,4-pentadiene : isoprene) which must be less than or equal to 0.5% and 0.2% respectively for the reasons given above.<br>
According to another aspect of this preferred embodiment, said purified final C5 fraction comprises isoprene in a mass fraction of less than 30% and advantageously less than or equal to 10%.<br>
According to another aspect of this preferred embodiment, the mass ratio (methyl butenes : isoprene) in said purified final C5 fraction is equal to or greater than 50%.<br>
According to a preferred example of implementation of said process for obtaining an isoprene homopolymer, the polymerisation reaction of the isoprene is performed at a temperature less than or equal to 5°C, so that said isoprene homopolymer has a cis-1,4 linkage content, measured according to the techniques of carbon 13 nuclear magnetic resonance or of mid-infrared analysis, which varies from 99.0% to 99.6%.<br>
Reference will be made to patent specification WO-A-02/38635 in the name of the Applicants for a detailed description of the implementation of this reaction at a temperature less than or equal to 5°C.<br><br>
Advantageously, polyisoprenes are obtained having cis-1,4 linkage contents, measured by one or the other of the aforementioned techniques, which are equal to or greater than 99.3% and belong even more advantageously to a range of from 99.3% to 99.6%, when the polymerisation is effected at a temperature of from -55°C to -20°C.<br>
Even more advantageously, polyisoprenes are obtained which have cis-1,4 linkage contents, also measured by one or the other of the aforementioned techniques, which are equal to or greater than 99.5% and are for example equal to 99.6%, when the polymerisation is effected at a temperature of from -55°C to -45°C.<br>
Generally, it will be noted that the particularly high cis-1,4 linkage content obtained for the polyisoprenes according to the invention is independent of the quantity of said catalytic system used.<br>
According to another advantageous characteristic of the invention, the isoprene homopolymers which are obtained by said process have inherent viscosities, measured at 0.1 g/dl in toluene at 25°C, which are greater than 3 dl/g, advantageously greater than 4 dl/g.<br>
It will be noted that the catalytic system according to the invention has the advantage of imparting, to the polymerisation reaction for the isoprene, practically one and the same advantageous conversion kinetics for the isoprene and, to the polyisoprenes obtained, practically the same high values of inherent viscosity at given conversion rates, whether or not the polymerisation medium comprises said methyl butenes.<br>

The aforementioned characteristics of the present invention, as well as others, will be better understood on reading the following description of several examples of embodiment of the invention, which are given by way of illustration and not of limitation.<br>
I. Preparation of a catalytic system according to the invention;<br>
1) Synthesis of an organic neodymium phosphate salt according to the invention:<br>
a) Synthesis of an aqueous solution of neodvmium NdCl3, (MgO:<br>
A given quantity of Nd2O3 is introduced into a reactor. 31.25 kg of demineralised water is added per kg of Nd2O3. 1.56 1 of 36% by weight concentrated HC1 (d = 1.18) is added slowly, at ambient temperature, per kg of Nd2O3.<br>
The reaction Nd2O3 + 6 HC1 + 9 H2O   -&gt;   2 NdCl3, 6H2O is highly exothermic.<br>
Once all the hydrochloric acid has been added, the solution is brought to boiling with stirring for 30 minutes, in order to eliminate the excess HC1. The aqueous NdCl3 solution is clear and mauve in colour. No insoluble product (Nd2O3) remains.<br><br>
The pH of the solution, measured at 25°C, is corrected by adding 2 moles per litre sodium hydroxide. The final pH is approximately 4.5.<br>
b) Synthesis of an organic sodium phosphate of formula<br>
27.8 kg of demineralised water per kg of Nd2Oa from the synthesis of section a) above is introduced into an empty reactor. 0.708 kg of NaOH pellets are dissolved per kg of Nd2C&gt;3 of said section a). 10.4 1 acetone and 5.819 kg of an organic phosphoric acid (bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid, listed in the "Aldrich" catalogue under the reference 23.782-5), are added to another reactor, still per kg of initial NdiC^.<br>
At ambient temperature, the solution of said organic phosphoric acid is poured into the solution of NaOH. The reaction is as follows:<br>
[RO]2P(O)Om-NaOH   -»   [RO]2P(O)ONa + H2O.<br>
This reaction is slightly exothermic, and a clear-coloured homogeneous solution is obtained. The pH of the solution, measured at 25°C, is equal to 5.4.<br>
c) Synthesis of a phosphated neodymium salt of the formula<br>
The aqueous solution of NdCl3,6H2O obtained in section a) above is poured on to the organic Na phosphate solution obtained in section b) above, with vigorous stirring and at a temperature of 45°C. Depending on the case, the addition may be performed in the reverse order. A very fine white precipitate forms immediately. The mixture obtained is kept stirred for 1 5 minutes, after the addition of all the organic Na phosphate:<br>
3 [RO]2P(O)ONa + NdCl3,6H2O   -&gt;    Nd[OP(O)[OR]2]3 + 3 NaCl + 6 H2O.<br>
The resultant phosphated neodymium salt is recovered by sedimentation and washed with a mixture of 45 litres of demineralised water and 15 litres of acetone for 15 minutes. The phosphated neodymium salt is then recovered by centrifugation.<br>
The pH of the mother liquors is between 2 and 3 at 25°C. These mother liquors are colourless and clear. The qualitative analytic test for chlorides is virtually negative for the<br><br>
final washing water (the reaction is as follows: NaCl + AgNOs (HNOa medium)    —     AgCl<br>
4   t  NaNO.0.<br>
The neodymium salt washed in this manner is dried in an oven at 60°C, under a vacuum and with air-flow for 72 hours.<br>
2) Synthesis of a "preformed" catalytic system according to the invention:<br>
a)	Composition of the catalytic system:<br>
The catalytic system comprises a phosphated neodymium salt as synthesised in section 1 ) above, which is suspended in a low molecular weight inert hydrocarbon solvent (consisting of methylcyclohexane, abbreviated to "MCH" hereafter).<br>
The catalytic system is characterised by the following relative molar ratios, with respect to the neodymium salt:<br>
Nd salt : butadiene (Bd) : DiBAH : DEAC = 1 : 30 : 1.8 : 2.6.<br>
The final concentration of Nd in the catalytic system is 0.02 M.<br>
b)	Process for synthesising the catalytic system:<br>
-	Fjrst stage:<br>
In order to obtain the catalytic system, 550 g of neodymium salt, in powdered state, is poured into a reactor which has been cleaned of its impurities beforehand. This salt is then subjected to nitrogen bubbling from the bottom of the reactor for a period of 15 minutes.<br>
-	Second stage:<br>
Approximately 90% (mass fraction) of the solvent mentioned in section 2)a) above is introduced into the reactor containing the neodymium salt, the duration of the contacting of the neodymium salt with this solvent being 30 min, the temperature of contact being 30°C.<br>
Then butadiene is introduced into the reactor (in the molar ratio salt : butadiene of 1 :30 mentioned in section 2)a) above) at a temperature of 30°C, in order to "preform" the catalytic system.<br><br>
-	Fourth stage:<br>
Then DiBAH as alkylating agent for the neodymium salt is introduced into the reactor, in a concentration of approximately 1 M in the MCH. The duration of the alkylation is 30 min. and the temperature of the alkylation reaction is 30°C.<br>
-	Fifth stage:<br>
Then DEAC as halogen donor is introduced into the reactor, in a concentration of approximately 1 M in the MCH. The temperature of the reaction medium is adjusted to 60°C.<br>
-	Sixth stage:<br>
"Preforming" (or ageing) of the mixture thus obtained is then carried out by maintaining this temperature of 60°C for a period of 2 hours.<br>
-	Seventh stage:<br>
There is thus obtained a solution of catalytic system. The reactor is emptied and this solution is transferred to a 750 ml "Steinie" bottle, which has beforehand been washed, dried and subjected to nitrogen bubbling.<br>
Finally, the catalytic solution is stored under a nitrogen atmosphere in a freezer at a temperature of -15°C.<br>
Table I hereafter contains the characteristics of the catalytic system and its preparation process.<br>
Table 1:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
If. "Control" test and test according to the invention for polymerisation of isoprene by means of the catalytic system prepared in § I:<br>
The polymerisation reactor is a 2.50 ml "Steinie" bottle, which contains 10.2 g isoprene and the tightness of which is ensured by a "septum/open-top seal" assembly which permits addition of said catalytic system according to the invention using a syringe.<br>
The polymerisation of the isoprene is carried out in cyclohexane at 50°C in an inert nitrogen atmosphere (the cyclohexane having been subjected to nitrogen bubbling for 10 minutes beforehand).<br>
The "control" test and the test according to the invention were carried out using 2.3 ml of said catalytic system, or a quantity of neodymium catalytic base of 450 micromoles per 100 grammes of isoprene monomer (abbreviated to uMcm).<br>
Furthermore, the same mass ratio S : M (solvent : isoprene monomer) which is equal to 9 and the same mass fraction of isoprene in the polymerisation medium which is equal to 10% were used for these tests.<br>
Acetylacetone was used as a shortstopping agent for each polymerisation reaction<br>
(1 ml of an acetylacetone solution of a concentration of 1M in cyclohexane), and N-1,3-dimethylbutyl-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (abbreviated to 6PPD) as a protection agent (in a concentration of 0.4 phr).<br>
Then each extracted solution was dried for approximately 18 hours in an oven at 60°C under a vacuum (at a pressure of 200 mm Hg), under a gentle stream of nitrogen.<br>
The conversion rate of isoprene to polyisoprene as a function of reaction time is measured to describe the polymerisation kinetics for each "control" test and each test according to the invention.<br>
The inherent viscosity at 0.1 g/dl in toluene, measured at 25°C, characterises the macrostructure of each polyisoprene obtained.<br>
1) "Control" polymerisation test in the absence of methyl butene:<br>
In this "control" test practically pure isoprene which had been extracted conventionally in a laboratory from a steam-cracked C5 naphtha fraction was used, by effecting:<br>
-	distillation of the initial C5 fraction over maleic anhydride to remove any residual<br>
cyclopentadiene, followed by<br>
-	passage through an alumina column to remove polar impurities, and<br>
-	nitrogen bubbling for 10 min., immediately prior to the polymerisation reaction.<br>
The mass fraction of isoprene extracted from this C5 fraction was determined, by gas<br>
phase chromatography (GPC, see Appendix 3), and is 99.2%.<br>
For this "control" test, 15 ml isoprene (or 10.2 g) and 128 ml cyclohexane as polymerisation solvent were used, such that the mass fraction of isoprene in the polymerisation medium is substantially equal to 10%.<br>
Table 2 hereafter shows the results obtained for this "control" test.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
2) Polymerisation test according to the invention in the presence of methyl butcnes:<br>
In this test according to the invention a polymerisation medium comprising approximately 10% isoprene, 5% 2-methyl 1-butene, 5% 2-methyl 2-butene and 80% cyclohexane (mass fractions) was used.<br>
In this test 15 ml (or 10.2 g) of the isoprene prepared in § II. 1) above (approximately 99.2% pure) and 113 ml cyclohexane is used.<br>
The 2-methyl 1-butene used is obtained by purification, carried out by means of passing drop by drop over an alumina column a 2-methyl 1-butene which is approximately 95% pure, sold by Fluka. 7.8 ml of 2-methyl 1-butene, or 5.1 g, is used.<br>
The 2-methyl 2-butene used is obtained by purification, carried out by means of passing drop by drop over an alumina column a 2-methyl 2-butene which is approximately 85% pure, sold by Fluka (this 2-methyl 2-butene was analysed by gas phase chromatography as being 93% pure). 7.7 ml of 2-methyl 2-butene, or also 5.1 g, is used.<br>
Table 3 hereafter shows the results obtained for this test according to the invention.<br>
Table 3:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
3) Conclusions:<br>
Tables 2 and 3 show that the catalytic system according to the invention, based on a conjugated diene monomer, a rare earth salt of an organic phosphoric acid suspended in an inert, saturated hydrocarbon solvent, an alkylating agent consisting of an alkylaluminium of formula AIR? or HA1R2 with a molar ratio (alkylating agent : salt) of from 1 to 5, and a halogen donor consisting of an alkylaluminium halide, makes it possible to polymerise isoprene selectively in the presence of 2-methyl 1-butene and 2-methyl 2-butene with a mass ratio (methyl butenes : isoprene) equal to 100% (the mass ratios (2-methyl 1-butene : isoprene) and (2-methyl 2-butene : isoprene) each being 50%), for obtaining a polyisoprene having a cis-1,4 linkage content equal to or greater than 98.0% and an inherent viscosity greater than 4.0 dl/g.<br>
It will be noted that the kinetics of conversion of the isoprene into polyisoprene relative to the test according to the invention in the presence of methyl butenes is very close to the kinetics relative to the "control" test without methyl butene. Furthermore, the inherent viscosity of the polyisoprene obtained in the test according to the invention is very close to that of the polyisoprene obtained in this "control" test.<br>
III. Obtaining of final fractions enriched with isoprene whether or not in accordance with the invention, from fluid catalvtically cracked initial fractions, for the selective polymerisation of isoprene in the presence of the catalytic system of§L:<br>
1) Examples of hvdrogenation of initial fractions A and B for obtaining intermediate fractions whether or not in accordance with the invention, at various hvdrogenation rates:<br>
In this first hydrogenation stage, a crude initial fluid catalytically cracked C5 fraction A or B (see composition in Table 4 hereafter) was subjected to a hydrogenation reaction, which was performed in the following manner according to one example of embodiment of the invention.<br>
1 g of catalyst based on palladium and calcium carbonate (of formula Pd/CaCCh and containing 5% by weight of Pd) and 100 ml of the initial C5 fraction are introduced into a 750 ml bottle. The bottle being capped at an initial pressure of 4 bar hydrogen and being agitated at 25°C, the hydrogen pressure is adjusted to 4 bar every hour for 3 hours. The total reaction time is 6 hours and 30 minutes.<br>
The effect of this hydrogenation reaction is in particular to hydrogenate the n-pentenes contained in the initial fraction at a given hydrogenation rate T, so as to reduce the quantity of n-pentenes in the intermediate hydrogenated fraction for the second dehydrogenation stage, the effect of which is to transform these n-pentenes into 1,3- and 1,4-pentadienes.<br>
a)  Initial  fraction  A and  intermediate fraction Al  according to the  invention, hydrogenated at a rate T1:<br>
Table 4 hereafter shows the composition of said initial C5 fraction A and the intermediate C5 fraction Al obtained following the above example of hydrogenation reaction at a hydrogenation rate Tl (the compositions are expressed in mass fractions in the corresponding fraction in % or in ppm, with 1 ppm = 1 part per million - 10"4%).<br><br>
Table 4:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
It will be noted that the intermediate fraction Al obtained, which is intended to be subjected to the dehydrogenation reaction to enrich it with isoprene, comprises a mass fraction of methyl butenes (less than 30%) which is very much less than the mass fraction close to 100%) which is usually required for the dehydrogenation, in order to obtain a final fraction usable for the homopolymerisation of isoprene.<br>
It will also be noted that the hydrogenation has made it possible to deplete the initial fraction A in n-penterie before dehydrogenation such that the intermediate fraction Al comprises less than 0.1% of n-pentenes, whereas said initial fraction A contained close to 20% thereof.<br>
b) Initial fraction B and intermediate fractions B2 to B6 whether or not in accordance with the invention:<br>
Another initial C5 fraction B similar to the initial C5 fraction A above was subjected to hydrogenation reactions carried out analogously and characterised by other hydrogenation rates of the n-pentenes T2 to T5, as illustrated in Table 5 hereafter.<br>
Table 5:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
It will be noted that each of the intermediate fractions B2 to B6 obtained, which are intended to be subjected to dehydrogenation in order to enrich them with isoprene, comprises a mass fraction of methyl butenes (less than 30%, or even less than 20% for fraction B6) which is very much lower than the mass fraction of close to 100% which is usually required before dehydrogenation, in order to obtain a final fraction usable for homopolymerisation of isoprene.<br>
It will also be noted that the hydrogenation at the rates T2 to T5 did not make it possible to deplete the initial fraction B in n-pentenes before dehydrogenation such that each intermediate fraction comprises less than 0.1% of n-pentenes. Consequently, the intermediate fractions B2 to B5 cannot be used to obtain final fractions according to the invention comprising at most 0.5% of 1,3-pentadiene and at most 0.2% of 1,4-pentadiene, which is a<br>
necessary condition to be able to polymerise selectively isoprene with satisfactory conversion kinetics close to those relating to the isolated polymerisation of isoprene and to obtain a polyisoprene of a viscosity analogous to that of polyisoprene obtained in isolation.<br>
On the other hand, the hydrogenation of the initial fraction B at the rate T6 made it possible to deplete this in n-pentenes before dehydrogenation, such that the intermediate fraction B6 thus obtained comprises less than 0.1% of n-pentenes and is therefore in accordance with the invention.<br>
2) Examples of dehydrogenation of the intermediate fractions Al, B5 and B6:<br>
Of the hydrogenated intermediate fractions Al and B2 to B6, the intermediate fractions Al, B5 and B6 were subjected to dehydrogenation operations for example implemented as follows.<br>
a) Dehydrogenation of the intermediate fraction Al in order to obtain the final fraction AT according to the invention:<br>
This intermediate fraction Al is introduced into a reactor containing a 140 ml catalytic bed heated to a temperature of between 600°C and 700°C, under currents of steam and nitrogen preheated to 65()°C.<br>
The ilow rates of the intermediate fraction Al, the steam and the nitrogen are 1.63 ml/min., 1460 ml/min. and 3.76 ml/min respectively.<br>
The catalytic bed is formed of iron oxide, chromium and potassium carbonate, and is sold by SHELL under the name "Shell 105".<br>
On emerging from the reactor and after condensation of the majority of the water, the effluents come into contact with a calcium chloride "trap" and an alumina "trap", before being condensed in a bath of dry ice and acetone (at approximately -60°C).<br>
Table 6 hereafter shows the composition of the final fraction Al' thus obtained.<br>
Table 6:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
It will be noted that the final fraction Al' is in particular characterised in that it comprises:<br>
isoprene in a mass fraction practically equal to 10%,<br>
methyl butenes in a mass ratio (methyl butenes : isoprene) of 65%,<br>
-    mono-olefins in a mass ratio (mono-olefins : isoprene) of 85%.<br>
It will also be noted that the hydrogenation stage, by the significant reduction in the amount of n-pentenes which it brings about, makes it possible to minimise the amount of pentadienes in the final fraction AT, because the mass ratios (1,3-pentadiene : isoprene) and (1,4-pentadiene : isoprene) are respectively less than 0.5% and 0.2% in the final fraction AT, which makes it usable after purification (intended to eliminate the disubstituted alkynes, the true alkynes and the cyclopentadiene) for the selective polymerisation of isoprene.<br>
3) Polymerisation of the isoprene contained in the final fraction A'l by means of the catalytic system "preformed" according to the invention:<br>
a)	Purification of the final fraction A'l before polymerisation:<br>
1100 ml of the final fraction A'l before purification is used which is subjected in a first stage to distillation on maleic anhydride under the following conditions:<br>
-	distillation column: 20 theoretical plates<br>
-	reflux ratio: 5<br>
-	maleic anhydride : cyclopentadiene: 30 (molar ratio), or 3 g of maleic anhydride<br>
-	contacting of the maleic anhydride and the fraction: one night at ambient temperature<br>
and in a second stage to elution in an alumina column containing 250-300 cm3 of regenerated alumina, kept under nitrogen, with two successive passes, slowly drop by drop (lOOml/h).<br>
b)	Polymerisation of the isoprene contained in this purified final fraction A'l:<br>
The final fraction A'l containing 3.42g isoprene is polymerised using the "preformed" catalytic system according to the invention, described in § l-2)a), by operating in accordance with the process and the conditions described in § II, except for the fact that a quantity of neodymium catalytic base of 1170 micromoles is used per 100 grammes of isoprene monomer and that the polymerisation is effected for 220 minutes.<br>
Table 7 hereafter shows the results obtained for this test according to the invention.<br>
Table 7:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The amount of cis measured by 13 carbon NMR analysis of the polyisoprene is 98.1% Polydispersity index measured by SEC: 2.6<br>
c) Dehydrogenation of the intermediate fraction B5 in order to obtain three final fractions B5\ B5" and B5'" not in accordance with the invention:<br>
Table 8 below shows the compositions of three final fractions B5', B5", B5'" obtained respectively by dehydrogenation operations applied to the aforementioned intermediate fraction B5 according to § III. 2) a) above, at three temperatures of 625°C, 650°C and 675°C.<br>
Table 8:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
It will be noted that each final fraction B5', B5", B5'" comprises isoprene in a mass fraction of less than 15% and that the mass ratio (methyl butenes : isoprene) within the final fractions B5' and B5" is approximately 60% and 50%, respectively.<br>
Furthermore, as mentioned in § III. 2) b) above, the hydrogenation stage, by the insufficient reduction in the amount of n-pentenes which it produces, does not make it possible to obtain a ratio (1,3-pentadiene : isoprene) in the final fractions B5', B5" and B5'" which is at most equal to 0.5%.<br>
d) Dehydrogenation of the intermediate fraction B6 in order to obtain three final fractions B6', B6" and B6"\ whether or not in accordance with the invention:<br>
Table 9 below shows the compositions of final fractions according to the invention B6\ B6", B6'" respectively obtained by dehydrogenation operations applied to the intermediate fraction B6 in accordance with § III. 2) a) above, at temperatures of 600, 625 and 650°C.<br>
Table 9: (Table Removed)<br><br><br>
It will be noted that each final fraction B6', B6" and B6'" is characterised in that it comprises isoprene in a mass fraction practically equal to or less than 10%.<br>
It will also be noted that the final fractions B6', B6" comprise methyl butenes in a mass ratio (methyl butenes : isoprene) practically equal to or greater than 50%.<br>
But it will be noted that only the final fraction B61 (characterised by a dehydrogenation temperature of 600°C) is usable to polymerise isoprene selectively with satisfactory conversion kinetics close to those relating to the isolated polymerisation of isoprene and in order to obtain a polyisoprene of high viscosity analogous to that of polyisoprene obtained in<br><br>
isolation, owing to the  fact that only this fraction B6' according to the invention is characterised by a ratio (1,3-pentadiene : isoprene) of less than or equal to 0.5%.<br>
IV. Comparative example, not in accordance with the invention, of a C' fraction enriched with isoprene by dehydrogenation, from a fluid catalyticallv cracked initial fraction C, without hydrogenation of this initial fraction C:<br>
Catalytic dehydrogenation of an initial C5 fraction C was carried out directly in the manner described in § 111. 2) a) above, to obtain a final C5 fraction C enriched with isoprene. Table 10 hereafter shows the respective compositions of these fractions C and C'.<br>
Table 10: (Table Removed)<br><br><br>
It will be noted that the absence of prior hydrogenation of the initial fraction C before the dehydrogenation stage results in an excessively high mass fraction of 1,3-pentadiene being obtained in the dehydrogenated fraction C' (4.6 % instead of the upper limit permissible according to the invention of 0.5%), which does not make it possible to selectively polymerise isoprene from this fraction and by means of the catalytic system of § I. with satisfactory conversion kinetics which are close to those relating to the isolated polymerisation of isoprene (i.e. the polymerisation medium comprising solely the cyclohexane solvent and the isoprene), nor to obtain a polyisoprene of high viscosity which is analogous to that of the polyisoprene obtained in isolation.<br>
APPENDIX 1: Determination of the microstructure of the polyisoprenes.<br>
By carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR analysis):<br>
a)	Preparation of the samples:<br>
2 g of polyisoprene are extracted in refluxing acetone for 8 hours. The extracted polyisoprene is then dried at ambient temperature under vacuum for 24 hours. This dried polyisoprene is then redissolved in chloroform. The polyisoprene solution is filtered and the solvent removed in a rotary evaporator for 4 hours (bath temperature is 40°C).<br>
For the purposes of the analysis, approximately 600 mg of the polyisoprene thus prepared is solubilised in CDClj (2 ml), directly in a 13C NMR tube.<br>
b)	Characteristics of the apparatus:<br>
-	Spectrophotometer sold under the name "BRUKER AM250".<br>
-	Resonance frequency (SFO):- 62.9 MHz.<br>
-	Pulse program: INVGATE.AU (suppression of the "NOE" effect for quantitative<br>
NMR analysis of I3C).<br>
-	Pulse duration: 9 jis (90°).<br>
-	Relaxation time: 10 s.<br>
-	Cumulative number of scans (NS) = 8192.<br>
c)	Assignment of the peaks of the spectrum:<br>
Peaks were identified after:<br>
Quang The Pham, R. Petiaud, H. Waton, M.F. Llauro Darricades, "Proton and NMR Spectra of Polymers", 1991, Penton Press.<br>
Integration method:<br>
-	No 1 ,2 structural units detected.<br>
-	The ratio between 3,4- and 1,4- contents is determined by means of the ethylenic<br>
carbons. The content of trans- 1,4 and cis-1,4 linkages in the polyisoprene is calculated from<br>
the aliphatic carbons.<br>
APPENDIX 2;<br>
Determination of the distribution of the molecular weights of the elastomers obtained by size exclusion chromatography (SEC).<br>
a)	Principle of the measurement:<br>
Size exclusion chromatography or SEC makes it possible physically to separate inacromolecules according to their size in the swollen state in columns filled with porous stationary phase. The macromolecules are separated by their hydrodynamic volume, the bulkiest being eluted first.<br>
Although not an absolute method, SEC does enable an assessment to be made of the molecular weight distribution of a polymer. On the basis of commercially available standards, the various number-average (Mn) and weight-average (Mw) molecular weights can be determined and the polydispersity index calculated (Ip = Mw/Mn).<br>
b)	Preparation of the polymer:<br>
There is no particular treatment of the sample of polymer before analysis. It is simply solubilised in tetrahydrofuran, at a concentration of approx. 1 g/1.<br>
c)	SEC analysis:<br>
The apparatus used is a "WATERS model 150C" chromatograph. The elution solvent is tetrahydrofuran, the flow rate is 0.7 ml/min, the temperature of the system is 35°C and the duration of analysis is 90 min. A set of four columns in series is used, of the trade names "SHODEX KS807", "WATERS type STYRAGEL HMW7" and two "WATERS STYRAGEL HMW6E".<br>
The volume of polymer sample solution injected is 100 ul The detector is a " WATERS model R132X" differential refractometer and the chromatographic data processing software is the "WATERS MILLENNIUM" system (version 3.00).<br><br>
APPENDIX 3:<br>
Determination of the compositions of the C5 fractions by gas phase chromatography<br>
(GPC).<br>
a)	GPC/F1D analysis:<br>
Analysis of each C5 fraction is effected from the injected volume of 0.2 ul without prior dilution, in order not to saturate the response of the flame ionisation detector (FID) used.<br>
b)	Chromatographic conditions used:<br>
Chromatograph HP6890<br>
Carrier gas: nitrogen<br>
Constant flow rate: 0.7 ml/min.<br>
Method of injection: "split"<br>
Ratio of "split": 50/1<br>
Temperature of the injector: 250°C<br>
Injected volume: 0.2 ul<br>
Column HP 1:	phase 100% of methyl polysiloxane<br>
length: 60 m<br>
internal diameter: 0.32 mm<br>
thickness of the film:<br>
Temperature program:	Tl = 15°C<br>
Dl =20min.<br>
PI = 20°C/min.<br>
T2 =280°C<br>
D2 = 4 min. FID temperature: 300°C.<br><br>
c)   Results;<br>
Semi-quantitative analysis was performed by calculating the relative proportion of the areas of the peaks of each chromatogram, in order to obtain a distribution. The differences in responses of the eluted compounds were not taken into consideration, as the FID did not detect signals which were due to the presence of non-eluted and eluted compounds. The proportion in % of a compound i is given by the following expression:<br>
100<br>
where Aj = area relative to the compound i, and<br>
= total of all the eluted compounds i (identified and non-identified).<br><br><br>
