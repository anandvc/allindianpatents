POLYMERIZED SURFACTANTS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compositions comprising polymerized surfactants<br>
and, in particular, compositions comprising polymerized surfactants that are useful in<br>
personal care applications and have relatively low irritation associated therewith.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Synthetic detergents, such as cationic, anionic, amphoteric, and non-ionic<br>
surfactants, are used widely in a variety of detergent and cleansing compositions to impart<br>
cleansing properties thereto. In addition, in certain compositions (e.g. personal care<br>
compositions such as shampoos, washes, etc.), it may be desirable to use combinations and<br>
levels of surfactants sufficient to achieve relatively high levels of foam volume and/or<br>
foam stability.<br>
However, as is recognized in the art, synthetic detergents tend to be irritating to the<br>
skin and eyes. Thus, as levels of such detergents are increased in attempts to increase<br>
cleansing and foaming properties associated with certain compositions, the irritation<br>
associated with such compositions also tends to increase, making them undesirable for use<br>
on or near the skin and/or eyes.<br>
Certain attempts to produce milder cleansing compositions have included<br>
*<br>
combining relatively low amounts of anionic surfactants (which tend to be relatively high-<br>
foaming but also relatively highly irritating), with relatively lower irritating surfactants<br>
such as nonionic and/or amphoteric surfactants. See, e.g. United States Patent No.<br>
4,726,915. Another approach to producing mild cleansing compositions is to associate the<br>
anionic surfactants with amphoteric or cationic compounds in order to yield surfactant<br>
complexes. See, e.g., United States Patent Nos. 4,443,362; 4,726,915; 4,186,113; and<br>
4,110,263. Disadvantageously, mild cleansing compositions produced via both of such<br>
methods tend to suffer from relatively poor foaming and cleansing performance. Yet<br>
another approach described in, Librizzi et al., (in United States Published Patent<br>
Application US20050075256 Al) discusses the use of a composition including both a<br>
hydrophobically modified polymer and a surfactant to provide low irritation cleansing<br>
composition.<br>
Nevertheless, applicants have recognized the need for additional approaches to<br>
providing reduced irritation compositions and further recognized the need to provide a<br>
variety of compositions and methods having reduced irritation to the skin and/or eye. In<br>
addition, in certain embodiments, applicants have recognized the need for compositions<br>
that are not only mild to the skin and/or eyes, but additionally exhibit desirable foam<br>
properties and/or other desirable aesthetic properties.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides personal care compositions that overcome the<br>
disadvantages of the prior art and have relatively low irritation properties associated<br>
therewith. In particular, applicants have discovered that certain polymerized surfactants<br>
may be used to great advantage to produce compositions having low irritation associated<br>
therewith and, in certain embodiments, combinations of additional beneficial aesthetic and<br>
other properties.<br>
According to one aspect, the present invention provides a personal care<br>
composition comprising a low-DP polymerized surfactant having a PMOD% of less than<br>
about 90%.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, provided are compositions comprising a low-DP<br>
polymerized surfactant, the compositions having a TEP value of about 3 or greater.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, provided are methods of making personal care<br>
compositions comprising combining a polymerized surfactant having a PMOD% of less<br>
than about 90% with at least one other personal care component to produce a personal care<br>
composition having a CMH&gt;% of less than about 90%.<br>
In yet another aspect of the invention, applicants have provided a method of<br>
treating the skin, hair, or vaginal region, the method comprising applying to the skin, hair,<br>
or vaginal region a composition comprising a low-DP polymerized surfactant having a<br>
PMOD% of less than about 90%.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
Figure 1 is a graphical depiction of idealized micelle size distributions for<br>
compositions of the present invention and compositions of the prior art.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
All percentages listed in this specification are percentages by weight, unless<br>
otherwise specifically mentioned.<br>
As used herein the term "polymerized surfactant" refers to any polymer including<br>
repeat units that are amphiphilic, i.e. the repeat units include at least one hydrophilic<br>
moiety and at least one hydrophobic moiety.<br>
A "repeat unit" is hereby defined as the smallest combination of chemical species<br>
(e.g., ions or atoms) that repeat periodically to generate the polymer. Polymerized<br>
surfactants can be visualized as a number of surfactant structures (i.e. amphiphiles) that are<br>
linked by a polymer backbone (ref. Anton, P.; Koberle, P.; Laschewsky, A. Makromol.<br>
Chem., 1993,194, 1-27).<br>
As will be readily understood by those of skill in the art, the term "hydrophilic<br>
moiety," is any anionic, cationic, zwitterionic, or nonionic group that is polar and generally<br>
water-soluble. Nonlimiting examples include anionics such as suifate, sulfonate,<br>
carboxylate, phosphate, phosphonates; cationics such as: ammonium, including mono-, di-<br>
, and trialkylammonium species, pyridinium, imidazolinium, amidinium,<br>
poly(ethyleneimmium); zwitterionies such as ammonioalkylsulfonate,<br>
ammonioalkylcarboxylate, amphoacetate; and nonionics such as hydroxyl, sulfonyl,<br>
poly(ethyleneoxy).<br>
A "hydrophobic moiety" is hereby defined as any nonpolar, generally water-<br>
insoluble group containing seven or more carbon atoms. Certain preferred hydrophobic<br>
moieties include moieties comprising about eight or more carbon atoms, more preferably<br>
about 10 or more carbon atoms. Certain particular preferred hydrophobic moieties include<br>
those having from about 8 to about 12 carbon atoms. Nonlimiting examples of<br>
hydrophobic groups include any saturated or unsaturated linear, branched, cyclic, or<br>
aromatic hydrocarbon species containing more than five carbon atoms. Functionalities that<br>
may be included in the hydrophobic group are, for example, ether, ester, ketone, amide,<br>
carbonate, urethane, carbamate, or xanthate functionalities.<br>
As defined herein, the term, "low-DP polymerized surfactant," refers to a<br>
polymerized surfactant, as defined above, which further meets the following criteria (a)<br>
and (b): (a) the polymerized surfactant has at least about 7 and less than about 2000<br>
amphiphilic repeat units on a weight average basis; and (b) the amphiphilic repeat units<br>
comprise at least about 10 mole % of the polymerized surfactant. Examples of certain<br>
preferred low-DP polymerized surfactants included those having 7 to about 2000<br>
amphiphilic repeat units, such as from 10 to about 1000 amphiphilic repeat units, and even<br>
more preferably from about 20 to about 500 amphiphilic repeat units. In certain<br>
embodiments, the low-DP polymerized surfactants of the present invention preferably '<br>
comprise least about 25 mole % of amphiphilic repeat units.<br>
As noted above, applicants have discovered unexpectedly that certain polymerized<br>
surfactants are suitable for use in producing compositions having relatively low irritation<br>
associated therewith. According to certain preferred embodiments, applicants have<br>
discovered that low-DP polymerized surfactants having a PMOD% (measured in accord<br>
with the procedure described herein below and shown in the Examples) of less than about<br>
90%, more preferably less than about 80%, more preferably less than about 50%, and more<br>
preferably less than about 40%, are useful in producing compositions having beneficially<br>
low irritation properties associated therewith.<br>
For example, applicants note that the "TEP value" associated with a particular<br>
composition, which value is measured conventionally via the Trans-Epithelial Permeability<br>
Test ('TEP Test") as set forth in the Invittox Protocol Number 86 (May 1994) incorporated<br>
herein by reference and described in further detail in the Examples below, has a direct<br>
correlation to the irritation to the skin and/or eyes associated with the composition. More<br>
specifically, a higher TEP value of a composition tends to indicate less irritation to the skin<br>
and eyes associated therewith as compared to a composition having a lower TEP value,<br>
which composition tends to cause higher levels of irritation to the skin and/or eyes.<br>
Applicants have recognized that the present compositions have surprisingly high TEP<br>
values/lower irritation associated therewith. For example, in certain embodiments, the<br>
present compositions have a TEP value of at least about 3 or greater, preferably at least<br>
about 3.5 or greater. In certain more preferred embodiments, the compositions produced<br>
according to the present methods exhibit a TEP value of at least about 4 or greater, more<br>
preferably, at least about S or greater, even more preferably, at least about 6 or greater. In<br>
certain particularly preferred embodiments, the compositions may, in fact, exhibit such an<br>
unexpected and markedly reduced Level of irritation, that the TEP score exceeds the<br>
measurement capability of the test, and is therefore recorded as "no leakage".<br>
Applicants have further discovered that two parameters of a composition, the (1)<br>
"average micelle hydrodynamic diameter dn," a measure of average micelle size and, in<br>
particular (2), the "fraction of micelles with dn
measurement of the degree of irritation mat may result from compositions that include<br>
surfactants. That is, applicants have recognized that surfactant micelles are rarely<br>
monodisperse in size and aggregation number (i.e., the average number of molecules of<br>
surfactant in a particular micelle). Instead, surfactant micelles tend to exist as a population<br>
with distributions of sizes and aggreation numbers that give rise to micelle size distribution<br>
functions, as shown by the example in Figure 1. Figure 1 is a graph 10 showing a micelle<br>
size distribution function for a typical conventional surfactant system, a composition<br>
including sodium laureth sulfate and cocamidopropyl betaine (curve 11, generated by<br>
fitting an idealized log normal distribution to actual data obtained by testing Comparative<br>
Example 19). Applicants have discovered, by comparison, that low-DP polymerized<br>
surfactants of the present invention are capable of providing a distribution of micelles that,<br>
as shown in curve 15, is "shifted" to favor larger micelles (curve generated by fitting an<br>
idealized log normal distribution to actual data obtained by testing Example 12).<br>
Accordingly, applicants have measured the relative small micelle fraction and<br>
average micelle size of the compositions of the present invention and comparative<br>
compositions as the "CMID%" and "CMIDz", respectively (both measured in accord with<br>
the procedures described herein below and shown in the Examples). As detailed below in<br>
Tables 7, 11 and 14, applicants have noted that compositionv of the present invention tend<br>
to exhibit a small micelle fraction, i.e., a fraction of micelles with dh 
referred to as "CMED%") that is surprisingly low. In one embodiment of the invention,<br>
the CMID% of the composition is less than about 90%, more preferably less than about<br>
80%, even more preferably less than about 50%, and most preferably less than about 30%.<br>
[Note that for sake of clarity it is emphasized that CMID% relates to the relative irritation<br>
associated with a property of a composition (including compositions comprising<br>
polymerized surfactants), whereas PMOD% relates to the relative irritation/relative<br>
suitability of a polymerized surfactant for use in a composition in accord with preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention.]<br>
Applicants have further recognized that the present invention allows for the<br>
production of compositions that exhibit not only reduced irritation, but also desirable foam<br>
properties. In particular, as detailed in Table 3, applicants have discovered that not only is<br>
it possible to formulate compositions that are have low irritation, but said compositions<br>
also have substantial foam. For example, in certain embodiments, compositions of the<br>
present methods have a foam value of about 25mL or greater. Tn certain more preferred<br>
embodiments, the compositions produced according to the present methods exhibit a foam<br>
value of at least about 50m.L or greater, more preferably, at least about lOOmL.<br>
Applicants have further recognized that the present invention allows for the<br>
production of compositions that exhibit not only reduced irritation, but also desirable<br>
rheology properties. In particular, applicants have discovered that while certain<br>
ingredients such as hydrophobically modified polymers tend to increase the viscosity and<br>
the yield point associated with a composition as more polymer is added, the polymerized<br>
surfactants of the present invention tend to have relatively small effect on the rheology of<br>
the compositions to which they are added. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, higher<br>
amounts of the present polymers may be added to more significantly reduce irritation<br>
without producing a composition that is too viscous for effective personal use.<br>
In addition, applicants have further discovered unexpectedly that while certain<br>
conventional surfactants become substantially more irritating as the concentration of<br>
surfactant in a composition is increased beyond a certain point, the polymerized surfactants<br>
of the present invention tend not to exhibit the same detrimental increasing irritancy at<br>
high concentrations. As shown in Table 14, it can be seen that as concentration of the<br>
polymerized surfactant increases from 4.8% to 10%, the CMID% value increases only a<br>
small amount, and TEP value is fairly stable as well, indicating that the properties of these<br>
compositions are surprisingly "dose independent."<br>
Any of a variety of polymerized surfactants that meet the above criteria may be<br>
suitable for the present invention. Although applicants do not wish to be bound by or to<br>
any particular theory of operation, it is believed that the polymerized surfactants meeting<br>
the above criteria act to reduce the irritation associated with personal care compositions, at<br>
least in part, by preferentially forming larger micelles(which tend to be less irritating) than<br>
traditional surfactants. Polymerized surfactants suitable for use in the present invention<br>
include polymerized surfactants of various chemical classifications and obtained via a<br>
variety of synthetic routes. Examples include polymers having a backbone that<br>
substantially comprises a plurality of carbon-carbon bonds, preferably essentially consists<br>
or consists only of carbon-carbon bonds and polymers having a backbone comprising a<br>
plurality of carbon-heteroatom bonds (as will be recognized by those of skill in the art, the<br>
backbone refers generally to the portion of repeat units in a polymer that is covalently<br>
bonded to adjacent repeat units (vs. "pendant groups")). Examples of suitable polymers<br>
having a backbone consisting essentially of carbon-carbon bonds and polymers comprising<br>
carbon-heteroatom bonds include the following, as well as, combinations of two or more<br>
thereof, and the like:<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
The following Trans-Epithelial Permeability ("TEP"), Dynamic Light Scattering,<br>
and Foam tests are used in the instant methods and in the following Examples. In<br>
particular, as described above, the TEP test is used to determine when a composition is a •<br>
reduced irritation composition according to the present invention; the Dynamic Light<br>
Scattering test may be used to determine the suitability of a particular polymerized<br>
surfactant (e.g., PMOD%) or composition (e.g., CMID%); and the Foam test may be used<br>
to determine the propensity of compositions to provide the high levels of foam, often<br>
desirable for cleansing compositions.<br>
Unless otherwise indicated, the amounts of ingredients in the Example and<br>
Comparative compositions listed in the tables are expressed in w/w% of ingredient based<br>
on the total composition.<br>
Trans-Epithelial Permeability Test ("TEP Test"):<br>
Irritation to the eyes and/or skin expected for a given formulation is measured in<br>
accordance with the Invittox Protocol Number 86, the "Trans-epithelial Permeability (TEP)<br>
Assay" as set forth in Invittox Protocol Number 86 (May 1994), incorporated herein by<br>
reference. In general, the ocular and/or skin irritation potential of a product can be<br>
evaluated by determining its effect on the permeability of a cell layer, as assessed by the<br>
leakage of fluorescein through the layer. Monolayers of Madin-Darby canine kidney<br>
(MDCK) cells are grown to confluence on microporous inserts in a 24-weIl plate<br>
containing medium or assay buffer in the lower wells. The irritation potential of a product<br>
is evaluated by measuring the damage to the permeability barrier in the cell monolayer<br>
following a 15 minute exposure to dilutions of the product. Barrier damage is assessed by<br>
the amount of sodium fluorescein that has leaked through to the lower well after 30<br>
minutes, as determined spectrophotometrically. The fluorescein leakage is plotted against<br>
the concentration of test material to determine the EC50 (the concentration of test material<br>
that causes 50% of maximum dye leakage, i.e., 50% damage to the permeability barrier).<br>
Higher scores are indicative of milder formulas.<br>
Exposure of a layer of MDCK cells grown on a microporous membrane to a test<br>
sample is a model for the first event that occurs when an irritant comes in contact with the<br>
eye. In vivo, the outermost layers of the corneal epithelium form a selectively permeable<br>
barrier due to the presence of tight junctions between cells. On exposure to an irritant, the<br>
tight junctions separate, thereby removing the permeability barrier. Fluid is imbibed to the<br>
underlying layers of epithelium and to the stroma, causing the collagen lamellae to<br>
separate, resulting in opacity. The TEP assay measures the effect of an irritant on the<br>
breakdown of tight junctions between cells in a layer of MDCK cells grown on a<br>
microporous insert. Damage is evaluated spectrophotometrically, by measuring the<br>
amount of marker dye (sodium fluorescein) that leaks through the cell layer and<br>
microporous membrane to the lower well.<br>
TVynamic T AftM Scattering Tesr ("PLS Test"):<br>
Dynamic light scattering (DLS, also known as Photon Correlation Spectroscopy or<br>
PCS) is a well-known method for determination of average micelle size (measured as<br>
hydrodynamic diameter, dH) and micelle size distribution (A comprehensive explanation of<br>
the technique can be found in the ISO test method ISO 13321:1996(E). The hydrodynamic<br>
size measured by DLS is defined as the size of a hypothetical hard sphere that diffuses in<br>
the same fashion as that of the particle being measured. In practice, micellar species are<br>
dynamic (tumbling), solvated species that maybe isotropic (spherical) or anisotropic (e.g.<br>
ellipsoidal or cylindrical) in shape. Because of this, the diameter calculated from the<br>
difrusional properties of the micelle will be indicative of the apparent size of the dynamic<br>
hydrated/solvated particle; hence the terminology, "hydrodynamic diameter." Micellar<br>
solutions for determination of micelle d^ are prepared by diluting the compositions to 3.0%<br>
of their original concentration with 0.1 |xm-filtered deionized water, obtained from a<br>
Millipore-Q filtration system. (The target dilution of 3.0% is chosen because it is within<br>
the typical concentration range of 1.0% - 10% dilution that is encountered during the use<br>
of rinse-off personal care compositions. The target dilution is also within the range of<br>
dilutions employed in the TEP test.) The samples are agitated on a vortex mixer at 1000<br>
rpm for a minimum of five minutes and then allowed to stand overnight prior to analysis.<br>
Samples are passed through a 0.2 jam Anatop-Plus syringe filter into dust-free disposable<br>
acrylic sizing cuvettes and sealed.<br>
The samples are analyzed using a Zetasizer Nano ZS DLS instrument (Malvern<br>
Instruments, Inc., Southborough, MA) operating at 25.0 "C. Samples must yield a<br>
minimum count rate of 100,000 counts per second (cps) for accurate determination of<br>
micelle dH and micelle size distribution. For samples with count rates below this<br>
minimum, the sample concentration maybe be gradually increased (i.e. diluted less) until<br>
the minimum count rate is achieved, or in some cases, the sample may be run in neat form.<br>
Values of micelle d» and the micelle size distribution are calculated using the Dispersion<br>
Technology Software (DTS) v4.10 package (Malvern Instruments Inc., Southborough,<br>
MA), which calculates the Z-average micelle d» according to the ISO 13321 test method.<br>
Values of average micelle dn are reported herein as the Z-average micelle d». The<br>
reported values of micelle d\\ are the average of three individual measurement runs. The<br>
intensity distribution of micelle size calculated by the DTS software is used to calculate the<br>
" fraction of micelles having values of dn under a given size limit.<br>
Additives exhibiting relatively large values of d» (i.e. greater than about 200 nm)<br>
compared to micellar species, for example, high MW polymeric rheology modifiers,<br>
polymeric conditioners, particulate opacifiers, (micro)emulsions of hydrophobic<br>
emollients, silicone (micro)emulsions, etc., are routinely added to personal care<br>
compositions comprising micellar species. To those skilled in the art of DLS, it is apparent<br>
that such nonmicellar materials will exhibit light scattering intensities orders of magnitude<br>
greater than the relatively smaller micellar species in the diluted sample. The scattering<br>
intensity of such materials will overwhelm the scattering signal of the micellar species,<br>
thus interfering in the accurate determination of micelle dH. Typically, this type of<br>
interference will lead to an erronously large measured value of micelle dH. To avoid such<br>
interference, it is most preferable to measure the micelle dH of the composition in the<br>
absence of additives exhibiting values of dH greater than about 200 nm. Those skilled in<br>
the art of DLS will recognize that additives exhibiting large values of dH should be<br>
separated from the sample via filtration or ultracentrifugation prior to determination of the<br>
micelle dH of the sample. Alternatively, higher order analysis of the DLS data using the<br>
Dispersion Technology Software v4.10 package may also be employed to obtain enhanced<br>
resolution and properly characterize micelle dH in the presence of nonmicellar scattering<br>
species.<br>
In accord with the above description and as shown hereafter in the Examples, the<br>
"PMOD%" and "PMODz-average" associated with a polymerized surfactant are calculated<br>
by preparing a model composition comprising about 4.8 active weight % of the<br>
polymerized surfactant, 0.3 weight percent of a combination of sodium methyl- (and)<br>
sodium propyl- (and) sodium ethyl paraben, (such as the product commercially available as<br>
Nipasept Sodium), 0.25 weight percent of tetrasodium EDTA (such as Versene 100 XL),<br>
with q.s. water, and using the DLS test to measure the fraction of micelles having a dH of<br>
less than 9nm in the resulting model composition (PMOD%), and the z-average micelle dH<br>
associated therewith (PMODz-average). Applicants have recognized that in certain<br>
embodiments, the polymerized surfactant to be tested may be incompatible with the above<br>
model composition. Thus, if, and only if, the formulation of the above model composition<br>
results in two separate liquid phases and/or precipitation of the polymer surfactant, then the<br>
PMOD% and PMODz-average procedure comprises making a composition comprising<br>
about 4.8 active weight % of the polymerized surfactant, 0.5 weight percent of sodium<br>
benzoate, 0.25 weight percent of tetrasodium EDTA (such as Versene 100 XL), with q.s.<br>
citric acid to a pH of 4.8 ± 0.2, with q.s. water, and using the DLS test to measure the<br>
fraction of micelles having a dH of less than 9nm in the resulting model composition<br>
(PMOD%), and the z-average micelle dH associated therewith (PMODz-average).<br>
For any other composition (including non-model compositions), the fraction of<br>
micelles having a dH of less than 9nm (CMTD%) and the z-average micelle dH (CMIDz-<br>
average) associated therewith are measured using the DLS test for such composition.<br>
Foam Volume Evaluation ("Foam Test"):<br>
The following Foam Test was performed on various personal care compositions to<br>
determine the Maximum Foam Volume upon agitation according to the present invention.<br>
The procedure was accomplished by adding 5.0 grams of the model solution that included<br>
a particular polymerized surfactant to be tested, to 995 grams of deionized water and<br>
mixing until homogenous. The mixture was then added to a sample tank of a Sita R-2000<br>
foam tester (commercially available from Future Digital Scientific, Co.; Bethpage, NY).<br>
The test parameters were set to repeat three runs (series count=3) of 250 ml sample size<br>
(fill volume—250 ml) with twelve stir cycles (stir count=12) for a 15 second stir time per<br>
cycle (stir time=l5 seconds) with the rotor spinning at 1000 RPM (revolution=1000) at a<br>
temperature setting of 30°C ±2°C. Foam Volume data was collected at each stir cycle and<br>
the average and standard deviation of the three runs was determined. Maximum Foam<br>
Volume was reported for each Example as the value after the twelfth stir cycle.<br>
