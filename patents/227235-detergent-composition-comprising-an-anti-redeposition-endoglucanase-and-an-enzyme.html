				<td>DETERGENT COMPOSITION<br>
The present invention relates to a detergent composition comprising an endo-glucanase t hat p rovides i mproved d etergency p erformance. The i nvention a Iso relates t o a detergent composition comprising a combination of an endo-glucanase and otner enzymes. One aspect of the invention relates ro a process of washing a fabric or hard surface with the endo-glucanase-containing detergent.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
An important objective of a washing process is to transfer, as completely as possible, the soil from the object being washed into the washing solution, such that the soii can then be discarded .with the wash solution. A wash process which merely redistributes the soil on the object being washed is obviously not satisfactory. Thus evaluations of detergency performance, i.e. the performance of washing processes, must include consideration both of the removal of soil from the object being washed and of the redeposition of this soil onto the object being washed or onto the equipment being used for the wash process.<br>
With some soils and some surfaces it is very difficult to achieve a satisfactory detergency performance. Problem soils include particulate soils such as clays and carbon. Visible soils are often difficult to wash away completely because they are. bound to, or attracted to, a surface by traces of non-visible, sticky substances. Problem surfaces include the surfaces of cotton fibres.<br>
To help overcome such problem soils, detergent formulations may include an anti-redeposition agent. The anti-redeposition agent is added in order to ensure that the above mentioned problem soils, once detached from the fabrics, can be kept dissolved or suspended in the wash liquor in such a way that they are not re-deposited on the cleaned fabric.<br>
To obtain both an anti-redeposition effect and a cleaning effect it has been suggested to add a mixture of cellulases to the detergent, one cellulase having anti-redeposition effect and one having a cellulose-degrading effect. EP 822 973 relates to a detergent composition comprising a mixture of cellulases and optionally also containing additional enzymes. However, there is a need for improved combinations of enzymes having anti-redeposition effect and other enzymes, such as proteases, amylases, hemi-cellulases, lipases and pectinases.<br>
Enzymes are commonly used to remove the sticky substances that increase soii binding. There is a need for improved enzyme performance in terms of soil removal and/or prevention of soil redeposition.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a detergent composition comprising an anti-redeposition endo-glucanase, i.e. an endo-glucanase having anti-redeposition effect. The inventors have found that such endo-giucanase containing detergents give advantages when used for washing fabrics (especially laundry washing) or hard surfaces (especially automatic dish washing).<br>
In the context of the present invention, an endo-giucanase having anti-redeposition effect is characterised by its ability to prevent redeposition in a wash test.<br>
The inventors also have found that detergent compositions comprising specific combinations of certain endo-glucanase(s) having anti-redeposition effect and certain cellulase(s) having increased stability towards anionic tensides such as linear (straight-chain) alkyl benzene sulfonates (often referred to as "LAS"), have advantages compared to the prior art detergent compositions described in EP 822 973. For instance, a decreased amount of enzyme protein is necessary to obtain the desired cleaning and anti-redeposition effect. This results in improved product economy.<br>
The inventors also have found that it is surprisingly advantageous to include an endo-glucanase having anti-redeposition effect in detergents that also contain other enzymes. These other enzymes include, for example, enzymes that are classified as protease, amylase, beta-glucanase, lipase, hemi-celiulase, cutinase, pectinase and pectate lyase.<br>
Thus in a first aspect the invention relates to a detergent composition comprising an endo-glucanase, wherein the endo-glucanase is selected from one of: (i)     the endo-glucanase having the amino acid sequence of position 1 to position 773 of<br>
SEQ ID NO: 2; (ii)     an endo-glucanase having a sequence of at least 90% identity to the amino acid sequence of position 1 to position 773 of SEQ ID NO:2; or a fragment thereof that has endo-glucanase activity; (iii)    an endo-glucanase characterized by the wash test method disclosed herein.<br>
In a second aspect the invention relates to a detergent composition comprising anionic tensides and a combination of an endo-glucanase as defined above and a fungal ceffu-lase, wherein both enzymes are stable in the presence of anionic tensides.<br>
In a third aspect the invention relates to a detergent composition containing both an endo-glucanase as defined above and one or more other enzyme from classes such as, but not limited to protease, amylase, beta-giucanase, lipase, hemi-cellulase, cutinase, pectinase and pectate lyase.<br><br>
In an aspect the invention relates to a process of using a detergent composition of the invention for washing or cleaning of fabric, hard surfaces or other objects in need of cleaning.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a detergent composition comprising an endo-glucanase having anti-redeposition effect.<br>
The endo-qlucanase with anti-redeposition effect<br>
The endo-glucanase having anti-redeposition effect is according to the invention<br>
selected from one of:<br>
(i) the endo-glucanase having the amino acid sequence of position 1 to position 773 cf SEQ ID NO: 2;<br>
(ii) an endo-glucanase having a sequence of at least 90% identity to the amino acid sequence of positional to position 773 of SEQ ID NO:2; or a fragment thereof that has endo-glucanase activity;<br>
(iii)    any endo-glucanase characterized by the wash test method disclosed below.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the endo-glucanase is derived from Bacillus sp. AA34Q, DSM 12648 and also shown in SEQ ID NO: 2 herein or a sequence being 90% identical thereto.<br>
The strain Bacillus sp. AA349, which has been isolated from a soil sample originating in Greece, was deposited by the inventors according to the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure at the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH, Mascheroder Weg 1b, D-38124 Braunschweig, Germany, on 25 January 1999 under the deposition number DSM 12648.<br>
The deposit was made by Novo Nordisk A/S and was later assigned to Novozymes A/S.<br>
Detergent compositions comprising anionic tensides<br>
A preferred embodiment the invention relates to a detergent composition comprising anionic tensides, and to a combination of an endo-glucanase as defined above and a fungal cellulase, wherein both enzymes are stable in the presence of anionic tensides, such as LAS.<br>
For the purpose of the present invention, enzymes that are stable in LAS are defined by a LAS stability test. Enzymes that give a LAS stability resul! of at least 50% are regarded as being LAS stable.<br><br>
Detergents commonly contain more than one type of surfactant, for example combinations of both anionic and nonionic surfactants. In a preferred embodiment the invention relates to detergent formulations in which the ratio (based on weight) between anionic anc non-ionic surfactants is &gt;1:1, preferably &gt;1.5:1.<br>
Thus, in a preferred embociment the invention relates to a detergent composition wherein<br>
(a)	the endo-glucanase is selected from one of:<br>
(i)      the endo-glucanase having the amino acid sequence of position 1 to position 773<br>
of SEQ ID NO: 2; (ii)     an endo-glucanase having a sequence of at least 90% identity to the ammo acid<br>
sequence of position 1 to position 773 of SEQ ID NO:2; or a fragment thereof that<br>
has endo-glucanase activity; and<br>
(b)	the cellulase is selected from one of:<br>
(i) the cellulase having the amino acid sequence of position 1 to position 299 of SEQ ID NO: 4; or<br>
(ii) a cellulase having a sequence of at least 70% identity to the amino acid sequence of position 1 to position 299 of SEQ ID NO:4, or a fragment thereof that has cellulase activity.<br>
Alternatively, the endo-glucanase of (a)(i) above is derived from Bacillus sp. KSMS237 deposited as FERM P-16067 (with the Patent Microorganism Depository, National Institute of Bioscience and Human-Technology, Agency of Industrial Science &amp; Industry, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, 305 Japan) and shown in position 1 to 824 of SEQ ID NO: 1 of JP 2000210081 A (hereby incorporated by reference).<br>
Other alternative celiulases are the LAS resistant variants disclosed in Example 8 of WO 98/12307. Preferred embodiments of the invention comprise these alternative celiulases in combination with the endo-glucanases of (a) above.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the cellulase is a Thielavia terrestris cellulase, preferably the cellulase disclosed in SEQ ID NO: 9 in WO 96/29397 and SEQ ID NO: 4 herein or an enzyme with at least 70% identity thereto. In a preferred embodiment the cellulase is the Thielavia terrestris variant disclosed in Example 1 of WO 98/12307.<br>
Identity<br>
In the context of the present invention the degree of identity is determined between two<br>
sequences indicating a derivation of the first sequence from the second. The identity is deter-<br>
* mined by means of the computer program GAP provided in the GCG program package. Thus,<br>
Gap GCGv8 is used with the following default parameters: GAP creation penalty of 3.0 and GAP<br><br>
extension penalty of 0.1, the default scoring matrix, for protein sequences. GAP uses the method of Needleman/Wunsch/Sellers to make alignments.<br>
Detergent compositions comprising ether enzymes<br>
Various types of enzymes are very commonly included in detergent formulations fcr laundry cleaning and for hard surface cleaning. One purpose of these enzymes is to degrade soil binding substances. These substances bind or attract soil and stains onto the fabric or hard surface. The degraded substances, and the associated soil and stain, are then more easily removed during the washing process. Redeposition of soil, which can be increased by soil binding substances, is prevented<br>
The substance on which an enzyme acts is called the substrate. Enzymes are known to be "substrate specific", i.e. each class of enzyme can only degrade one class of substances. For example, a protease can degrade proteins but cannot degrade starch. An amylase can degrade starch but cannot degrade proteins.<br>
Because the soils and stains that are important for detergent formulators can contain many kinds of soil binding substances, a range of different enzymes, all with different substrate specificities have been developed for use in detergents. These include enzymes such as protease, amylase, beta-glucanase, lipase, hemi-cellulase, cutinase, pectinase and pectate lyase.<br>
Surprisingly it has been found that the endo-glucanase of the invention are not substrate specific, in that they can provide detergency benefits on a wide range of soils and stains when used in combination with other enzymes.<br>
The endo-glucanase of the present invention includes, in addition to the enzymes specified by reference to SEQ ID NO 2, other endo-glucanases with surprisingly high anti-redeposition effect. Two tests are provided in order to describe and identify these enzymes: 1) a test for endo-glucanase activity, and 2) a test for anti-redeposition effect. Enzymes which provide greater than the specified minimum performance on both these tests are regarded, for the purpose of this invention, as endo-glucanases having anti-redeposition effect.<br>
Thus in a preferred embodiment an endo-glucanase of the invention is used together with an amylase to provide improved detergency performance on soils that contain starch. Such amylases comprise e.g. a- or (3-amylases of bacterial or fungal origin. Chemically or genetically modified mutants of such amylases are included in this connection. Relevant a-amylases include, for example, a-amylases obtainable from Bacillus species, in particular a special strain of S. licheniformis, described in more detail in GB 1296839. Relevant commercially available amylases include Natalase™, Stainzyme®, Duramyl®, Termamyl®, Termamyl™ Ultra, Fungamyl® and BAN® (all available from Novozymes A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark), and Rapidase™ and Maxamyl™ P (available from DSM.

In another preferred embodiment an endo-glucanase of the invention is used together with a protease to provide improved detergency performance on soils that contain protein. Such proteases comprise those of animal, vegetable or microbial origin. Proteases of microbial origin are preferred. Chemically or genetically modified mutants of such proteases are included in this connection. The protease may be a serine protease, preferably an alkaline microbial protease or a trypsin-like protease. Examples of alkaline proteases are subtilisins, especially those derived from Bacillus, e.g., subtilisin Novo, subtilisin Carlsberg, subtilisin 309, subtilisin 147 and subtilisin 168 (described in WO 89/06279). Examples of trypsin-like proteases are trypsin (e.g. of porcine or bovine origin) and the Fusarium protease described in WO 89/06270.<br>

impurities.	m   .<br>
Soil release agents useful in compositions of the present invention are conventionally copolymers or terpolymers of terephthalic acid with ethylene glycol and/or propylene glycol<br><br>
units in various arrangements. Examples of such polymers are disclosed in US 4,116,885 and 4,711,730 and EP 0 272 033. A particular preferred polymer in accordance with EP 0 272 033 has the formula:<br>
(CH3(PEG)43)o.75(POH)c25[T-PO)2.8(T-PEG)o.4]T(POH)o.25((PEG)43CH3)o.75<br>
where PEG is -(OC2H4)0-, PO is (0C3H6O) and T is (pOOC6H4CO).<br>
Also very useful are modified polyesters as random copolymers of dimethyl terephthalate, dimethyl sulfoisophthalate, ethylene glycol and 1,2-propanedioI, the end groups consisting primarily of sulphobenzoate and secondarily of mono esters of ethylene glycol and/or 1,2-propanediol. The target is to obtain a polymer capped at both end by sulphobenzoate groups, "primarily'1, in the present context most of said copolymers herein will be endcapped by sulphobenzoate groups. However, some copolymers will be less than fully capped, and therefore their end groups may consist of monoester of ethylene glycol and/or 1,2-propanediol, thereof consist "secondarily" of such species.<br>
The selected polyesters herein contain about 46% by weight of dimethyl terephthalic acid, about 16% by weight of 1,2-propanediol, about 10% by weight ethylene glycol, about 13% by weight of dimethyl suifobenzoic acid and about 15% by weight of suifoisophthalic acid, and have a molecular weight of about 3.000. The polyesters and their method of preparation are described in detail in.EP 311 342.<br>
Softening agents: Fabric softening agents can also be incorporated into laundry detergent compositions in accordance with the present invention. These agents may be inorganic or organic in type.

These materials are normally added to the spray<br><br>
dried portion of the composition, although in some instances it may be more convenient to add them as a dry mixed particulate, or spray them as moiten liquid on to other solid components of the composition.<br>
Polymeric dve-transfer inhibiting agents; The detergent compositions according to the present invention may also comprise from 0.001% to 10%, preferably from 0.01% to 2%, more preferably form 0.05% to 1% by weight of polymeric dye- transfer inhibiting agents. Said polymeric dye-transfer inhibiting agents are normally incorporated into detergent compositions in order to inhibit the transfer of dyes from colored fabrics onto fabrics washed therewith.

Use of detergents: The enzyme c omposition o f the i nvention may beu seful i n a d etergent composition for household or industrial laundering of textiles and garments, and in a process for machine wash treatment of fabrics comprising treating the fabrics during one or more washing cycle of a machine washing process with a washing solution containing the enzyme or enzyme preparation of the invention.<br>
The enzyme composition of the invention may also be useful in a detergent composition for housenold or industrial dish or cutlery or other hard surface washing, and in a process for treatment of dishes, cutlery etc. comprising a treatment with a washing solution containing the enzyme or enzyme preparation of the invention.<br>
Typically, the detergent composition used in the washing process comprises conventional ingredients such as surfactants (anionic, nonionic, zwitterionic, amphoteric), builders, bleaches (perborates, percarbonates or hydrogen peroxide) and other ingredients, e.g. as described in WO 97/01629 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
The endo-glucanase of the invention provides advantages such as improved stain removal and decreased soil redeposition. Certain stains, for example certain food stains, contain beta-glucans which make complete removal of the stain difficult to achieve. Also, the cellulosic fibres of the fabrics may possess, particularly in the "non-crystalline" and surface regions, glucan polymers that are degraded by this enzyme. Hydrolysis of such glucans, either in the stain or on the fabric, during the washing process decreases the binding of soils onto the fabrics.<br>
Household laundry processes are carried out under a range of conditions. Commonly, the washing time is from 5 to 60 minutes and the washing temperature is in the range 10 - 60°C, most commonly from 20 - 40°C. Prolonged soaking is commonly used. The washing solution is normally neutral or alkaline, most commonly with pH 5 - 11.5. Bleaches are commonly used, particularly for laundry of white fabrics and in the washing of hard surfaces. These bleaches are-commonly the peroxide bleaches, such as sodium perborate, sodium percarbonate or hydrogen peroxide.<br>

Strains and donor organism<br>
The Bacillus $p. DSM 12648 mentioned above comprises the endo-glucanase encoding DNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:1.<br>
B.subtilis PL2306: This strain is the B.subtilis DN1885 with disrupted apr and npr genes (Diderichsen, B.( Wedsted, U.t Hedegaard, L, Jensen, B. R., Sjoholm, C. (1990) Cloning of aldB, which encodes alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase, an exoenzyme from Bacillus brevis. J. Bacteriol., 172, 4315-4321) disrupted in the transcriptional unit of the known Bacillus<br><br>
subtilis cellulase gene, resulting in cellulase negative cells. The disruption was oerformed essentially as described in Eds. A.L Sonenshein, J.A. Hoch and Richard Losick (1993) Bacillus subtilis and other Gram-Positive Bacteria, American Society for microbiology, p.618.<br>
Competent cells were prepared and transformed as described by Yascin, R.E., Wilson, G.A. and Young, F.E. (1975) Transformation and transfection in iysogenic strains of Bacillus subtilis: evidence for selective induction of prophage in competent ceils. J. Bacterid, 121:296-304.<br>
General molecular biology methods<br>
Unless otherwise stated all the DNA manipulations and transformations were performed using standard methods of molecular biology (Sambrook et al. (1989) Molecular cloning: A laboratory manual, Cold Spring Harbor lab., Cold Spring Harbor, NY; Ausubel, F. M. et al. (eds.) "Current protocols in Molecular Biology". John Wiley and Sons, 1995; Harwood, C. R., and Cutting, S. M. (eds.) "Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus". John Wiley and Sons, 1990).<br>
Enzymes for DNA manipulations were used according to the manufacturer's instructions (e.g. restriction endonucleases, ligases etc. are obtainable from New England Biolabs, Inc.).<br>
Plasmids<br>
pMOL944. This plasmid is a pUB110 derivative essentially containing elements making the plasmid propagate in Bacillus subtilis, kanamycin resistance gene and having a strong promoter and signal peptide cloned from the amyL gene of B.licheniformis ATCC14580. The signal peptide contains a Sacll site making it convenient to clone the DNA encoding the mature part of a protein in-fusion with the signal peptide. This results in the expression of a Pre-protein which is directed towards the exterior of the cell.<br>
The plasmid was constructed by means of ordinary genetic engineering and is briefly described in the following.<br>
Construction of pMOL944;<br>
The pUB110 plasmid (McKenzie. T. et al., 1986, Plasmid 15:93-103) was digested with the unique restriction enzyme Neil. A PCR fragment amplified from the amyL promoter encoded on the plasmid pDN1981 (PI. Jargensen et al., 1990, Gene, 96, p37-41.) was digested with Neil and inserted in the Neil digested pUB110 to give the plasmid pSJ2624.<br>
The two PCR primers used have the following sequences: # LWN5494 (SEQ ID NO:5)<br>
5'-GTCGCCGGGGCGGCCGCTATCAATTGGTAACTGTATCTCAGC-3'<br><br>
#LWN5495(SEQIDNO:6)<br>
5'-GTCGCCCGGGAGCTCTGATCAGGTACCAAGCTTGTCGACCTGCAGAA TGAGGCAGCAAGAAGAT -3'<br>
The primer #LWN5494 inserts a Notl site in the plasmid.<br>
The plasmid pSJ2624 was then digested with Sad and Notl and a new PCR fragment amplified on amyL promoter encoded on the pDN1981 was digested with Sacl and Notl and this DNA fragment was inserted in the Sacl-Notl digested pSJ2624 to give the plasmid PSJ2670.<br>
This cloning replaces the first amyL promoter cloning with the same promoter but in the opposite direction. The two primers used for PCR amplification have the following sequences:<br>
#LWN5938 (SEQ ID NO:7)<br>
5*-GTCGGCGGCCGCTGATCACGTACCAAGCTTGTCGACCTGCAGAATG<br>
AGGCAGCAAGAAGAT -3' #LWN5939 (SEQ ID NO:8)<br>
5*-GTCGGAGCTCTATCAATTGGTAACTGTATCTCAGC-3'<br>
The plasmid pSJ2670 was digested with the restriction enzymes Pstl and Bell and a PCR fragment amplified from a cloned DNA sequence encoding the alkaline amylase SP722 (Patent # W09526397-A1) was digested with Pstl and Bell and inserted to give the plasmid pMOL944. The two primers used for PCR amplification have the following sequence: #LWN7864 (SEQ ID NO:9)<br>
5'-AACAGCTGATCACGACTGATCTTTTAGCTTGGCAC-3' #LWN7901 (SEQIDNO:10)<br>
5* -AACTGCAGCCGCGGCACATCATAATGGGACAAATGGG -3'<br>
The primer #LWN7901 inserts a Sacll site in the plasmid.<br>
Genomic DNA Preparation<br>
The strain DSM 12648 was propagated in liquid medium 2xTY containing 1%<br>
carboxymethyl-cellulose + (0.1M Na2C03 + 0.1M NaHC03 separately autoclaved and added aseptically after cooling to room temperature). After 16 hours of incubation at 30°C and 300 rpm, the cells were harvested, and genomic DNA was isolated by the method described by Pitcher et a/. [Pitcher, D. G„ Saunders, N. A, Owen, R.

Test for endo-qlucanase activity<br>
The purpose of this test, used in combination with the "test for anti-redeposition effect" described below, is to determine if an enzyme is an endd-glucanase with anti-redeposition effect, according to this invention.<br>
The test is made by determining the color released from an insoluble, colored, glucan substrate over a reaction time of 30 minutes at a temperature of 40°C.<br>
Enzyme sample: The enzyme sample for testing is a solution of the enzyme protein with a concentration of 0.1 mg /ml. Standard biochemical techniques can be used to verify the purity and determine the protein concentration of the sample.<br>
Buffer: Prepare a 0.05M phosphate buffer solution with pH 7.0 from NaH2PO4.2H20 and NaOH and add 1g/l nonionic surfactant (e.g. Berol 537, from Akzo Nobel).<br>
Test method: Transfer 6 ml buffer into two test tubes. To one tube add 50pl of the enzyme sample. No enzyme is added to the second tube. Add one beta-glucazyme tablet (supplied by Megazyme, Ireland, catalogue number T-BGZ) to each tube. Mix the contents of the tubes for 10 seconds with a vortex mixer, then place the tubes in a 40°C water bath. After 10 minutes and after 20 minutes, mix the contents of the tubes by inverting the tubes. After 30 minutes, mix the contents of the tubes by inverting the tubes and then filter the contents of the tubes through a Whatman GF/C 9cm filter, collecting the filtrates in clean tubes. Measure the color released as OD at 590 nm using a spectrophotometer. Calculate deltaOD by subtracting the result with no enzyme from the result with enzyme.}<br>
If deltaOD &gt; 0.2 then the enzyme is an endo-glucanase.<br><br>
Test for anti-redeposition effect<br>
The purpose of this test, used in combination with the "test for endo-glucanase activity" described above, is to determine if an enzyme is an endo-glucanase with anti-redeposition effect, according to this invention.<br>
The anti-redeposition effect is measured by a wash test. The anti-redeposition wash test is made by washing samples of soiled cotton fabric and samples of clean cotton fabric, both together, in a small-scale wash test apparatus. After the washing the soil on the originally clean cotton fabric is evaluated by light reflectance.<br>
E nzyme sample: The enzyme sample for testing is a solution of the enzyme protein with a concentration of 0.1 mg /ml. Standard biochemical techniques can be used to verify the purity and determine the protein concentration of the sample.<br>
Cotton fabric; #2003 white woven 100% cotton fabric, supplied by Tanigashira, 4-11-15 Komatsu Yodogawa-ku, Osaka, 533-0004, Japan. The new cotton fabric is pre-washed three times before use in the wash test. The pre-washing is done using a European household front-loader washing machine, and using a standard 40°C wash process. LAS (Surfac® SDBS80 sodium alkylbenzene sulfonate, 80%) is added to the wash water at concentration 0.5 g per liter and the wash solution pH is adjusted to 10 by addition of sodium carbonate. After the pre-washing the fabric is dried in a tumbler drier. Swatches of the pre-washed cotton fabric, size 5x5cm, weight approximately 0.3g each, are cut out and these swatches are used for the wash tests.<br>
Soiled cotton swatches: Swatches of the pre-washed #2003 fabric, prepared as above, are soiled as follows. A suspension of 210 mg carbon black ("carbon for detergency tests", supplied by Sentakukagaku-kyokai, 2-11-1 Shtmomaruko Ohta-ku, Tokyo 146-8620, Japan) is prepared in 75 ml tetrachloroethylene (Fluka, cat. nr. 86972) by strong stirring. The cotton swatches are placed flat on a horizontal metal surface. 300JJI of the carbon suspension is pipetted onto the centre of each cotton swatch. The soiled cotton swatches are allowed to dry at room temperature overnight.<br>
Detergent solutions: Detergent solutions are prepared as follows. To prepare 1 liter of solution, dissolve in deionised water 0.5g sodium carbonate and 1.0g sodium hydrogen carbonate and add 2 ml of a solution containing 117.8 g/l CaCI2.2H20 and 54.3 g/l MgCI2.6H20. This calcium/magnesium addition provides a water hardness of 12 °dH. Add 0.5g LAS (Surfac SDBS80 sodium alkylbenzene sulfonate, 80%, supplied by Surfachem, UK or an equivalent material) and adjust the final volume to 1 liter. Adjust the pH to 9.5 (e.g. by addition of sodium carbonate)<br>
Wash tests: Three soiled swatches (prepared as described) and three clean swatches (of the same pre-washed #2003 cotton) are washed in a Mini-Terg-O-Tometer machine. The Mini-Terg-O-Tometer is a small-scale version of the Terg-O-Tometer test<br><br>
washing   machine   described   in  Jay   C.   Harris,   "Detergency   Evaluation   and   Testing", Interscience Publishers Ltd. (1954) pp. 60-61. The following conditions are used:<br>
Beaker size	250mi<br>
Wash solution volume	100ml<br>
Wash temperature	40°C<br>
Wash time	30 minutes<br>
Agitation	150 rpm<br>
The detergent solutions are pre-warmed to 40°C before starting the test. The cotton swatches and 10OpI of the enzyme sample are added at the start of the 30 minute wash period. The reference test, with no added enzyme, is started at the same time.<br>
After the wash, the fabric swatches are rinsed for 5 minutes under running tap water, then spread out fiat and allowed to air dry at room temperature overnight.<br>
Instrumental evaluations; Light reflectance evaluation of the originally clean fabric swatches is done using a Macbeth Color Eye 7000 reflectance spectrophotometer. The measurements are made at 500nm. The UV filter is not included. Measurements are made on the front and back of each swatch. An average result for reflectance (R, 500nm) for the three originally clean swatches is then calculated-from the six measurements.<br>
The anti-redeposition effect of a given enzyme sample is calculated as:<br>
(R, 500nm with the enzyme) - (R, 500nm no enzyme added)<br>
The enzyme is an endo-glucanase with anti-redeposition effect according to the invention if the anti-redeposition effect obtained is &gt;7.5, and the result in the test for endo-glucanase activity, above, is &gt;0.2.<br>
LAS stability test<br>
The test is made by comparing the color released from an insoluble colored cellulase substrate over a reaction time of 60 minutes at a temperature of 40°C when the solution contains a buffer but no surfactant and when the solution contains a buffer and LAS. If the enzyme is stable during the 60 minute reaction time then the color released is greater than if the enzyme is not stable, because the stable enzyme will continue to degrade the substrate whereas the non-stable enzyme will not continue to degrade the substrate. In the context of the present invention, if the result with LAS is &gt; 50% of the result without LAS then the enzyme is LAS stable.<br>
The details of the test method are as follows. Buffer (no LAS):<br><br>
Prepare a 0.05M phosphate buffer solution with pH 7.0 from NaH2P04.2H20 and NaOH. Buffer (with LAS):<br>
Dissolve l.Og LAS in 1 liter of the above buffer. The LAS is Surfac5 SDBS80 sodium alkylbenzene sulfonate, 80% (supplied by Surfachem, UK) or an equivalent material.<br>
Test method:<br>
Prepare a dilution of the enzyme to be tested in deionised water. The concentration of the enzyme is such that the result for deltaOD (no LAS), calculated as described below, is in the range 0.2 to 0.5.<br>
Transfer 6 ml of the buffer (no LAS) into two test tubes. Add 1 50pl of the enzyme dilution into one tube. No enzyme is added to the other tube. Add one Cellazyme® C tablet (supplied by Megazyme, Ireland, catalogue number T-CCZ) into both tubes. Mix strongly for about 10 seconds using a vortex mixer. Place both tubes in a 40°C water bath. After 15, 30 and 45 minutes, mix the contents of the tubes by inverting the tubes. After 60 minutes, mix the contents of the tubes by inverting the tubes and then filter the contents through a 9cm diameter Whatman® GF/C filter, collecting the filtrate in a clean tube. Measure the OD of the filtrate at 590 nm using a spectrophotometer. Calculate deltaOD (no LAS) by subtracting the result with no enzyme from the result with enzyme.<br>
Then repeat the test using the same concentration of the enzyme and with 6 ml buffer (with LAS) instead of 6 ml buffer (no LAS). Calculate deltaOD (-with LAS) by subtracting the result with no enzyme from the result with enzyme.<br>
Calculate the LAS stability %: (deltaOD (with LAS) / deltaOD (no LAS)) * 100<br>
Wash tests with the endo-qlucanase in combination with other enzymes<br>
This procedure is used to determine the enzyme detergency benefit values, see Examples 6-11 below.<br>
The wash tests are made by washing samples of soiled cotton fabric and samples of clean cotton fabric, both together, in a small-scale wash test apparatus. After the washing the soil on the cotton fabric is evaluated by light reflectance. Both the originally soiled cotton fabric and the originally clean cotton fabric samples are evaluated.<br>
Cotton fabric: #2003 white woven 100% cotton fabric, supplied by Tanigashira, 4-11-15 Komatsu Yodogawa-ku, Osaka, 533-0004, Japan. The new cotton fabric is pre-washed three times before use in the wash test. The pre-washing is done using a European household<br><br>
front-loader washing machine, and using a standard 40°C wash process. LAS (Surface SDBS80 sodium alkylbenzene sulfonate, 80%) is added to the wash water a; concentration 0.5 g per liter and the wash solution pH is adjusted to 10 by addition of sod.-m carbonate. After the pre-washing the fabric is dried in a tumbler drier. Swatches of the pre-cashed cotter, fabric, size 5x5cm, weight approximately 0.3g each, are cut out and these swa:cnes are usee for the wash tests.<br>
Soiled cotton swatches: These are prepared from the 5x5cm swatcres describee above.<br>
Wash tests: Three soiled swatches and three clean swatches are wasned in a Mini-Terg-O-Tometer machine. The Mini-Terg-O-Tometer is a small-scale version of the Terg-C-Tometer test washing machine .described in Jay C. Harris, "Detergency Evaluation and Testing", Interscience Publishers Ltd. (1954) pp. 60-61. The following conditions 3re used:<br>
Beaker size	250ml<br>
WasfTsolution volume	100ml<br>
Wash temperature	40°C<br>
Wash time	30 minutes<br>
Agitation	150 rpm<br>
The detergent solutions are pre-warmed to 40°C before starting the test. The fabric  ... and the enzymes are added at the start of the 30 minute wash period. After the wash, the fabric swatches are rinsed for 5 minutes under running tap water, then spread out flat anc allowed to air dry at room temperature overnight.<br>
Instrumental evaluations: Light reflectance evaluation of the fabric swatches is done using a Macbeth Color Eye 7000 reflectance spectrophotometer. The measurements are made at 500nm. The UV filter is not included. Measurements are made on the front and back of each swatch. The soiled swatches are measured in the centre of the soiled area. Average results for reflectance (R, 500nm) for the soiled swatches and for the clean swatches are then calculated from the six measurements on each type.<br>
Detergent solutions: Detergent solutions are prepared as follows: To prepare 1 liter of solution, dissolve in deionised water 0.5g sodium carbonate and 1.0g sodium hydroger, carbonate and add 2 ml of a solution containing 117.8 g/l CaCI2.2H20 and 54.3 g/I MgCI2.6H20. This calcium/magnesium addition provides a water hardness of 12 *dH. Add nonionic surfactant (Berol® 537, Akzo Nobel) and/or LAS (Surfac® SDBS80 sodium alkylbenzene sulfonate, 80%) and adjust the final volume to 1 liter. Adjust the pH to either pH 9.5 (by addition of sodium carbonate) or to pFH 7.5 (by addition of 10% citric acid solution).<br><br>
The concentration of LAS and of nonionic surfactant and the detergent solution pH are specified below for each wash test.<br>
Enzyme addition: The enzymes to be tested are pre-dissolved at known concentrations in water, and the required amount of enzyme is added to the detergent solution at the start of the wash process.<br>
Calculation of enzyme detergency benefit: The enzyme detergency benefit is a measure of how much more clean the swatches, both the originally soiled and the originally clean, become as a resultof including enzymes in thewashtest. The enzyme detergency benefit is calculated as follows:<br>
After the wash test the average R, 500nm value for the soiled swatches is R, soiled. After the wash test the average R, 500nm value for the clean swatches is R, clean. The enzyme detergency benefit from a wash test with enzymes is the sum of R, soiled + R, clean with enzymes minus the sum of R, soiled + R, clean with no added enzyme.<br>
The enzyme detergency benefit value determined in this way is a combined measure both of the removal of soil from the fabric and of the redeposition of soil onto the fabric. Thus the enzyme detergency benefit value can have values that are negative or positive. The enzyme detergency benefit value can be used to compare the performance of different enzymes. The highest positive detergency benefit value is the preferred result.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Cloning and expression of endo-glucanase gene from Bacillus sp.<br>
Sub-cloning and expression of mature endo-glucanase in B.subtilis.<br>
The endo-glucanase encoding DNA sequence of the invention was PCR amplified using the PCR primer set consisting of these two oligo-nucleotides:<br>
# 168684 (SEQ ID NO:11)<br>
5'-CAT TCT GCA GCC GCG GCA GCA GAA GGA AAC ACT CGT GAA GAC-3'<br>
#168685 (SEQ ID NO:12)<br>
5-GCG TTG AGA CGC GCG GCC GCT TAC TCT TCT TTC TCT TCT TTC TC-3'<br>
Restriction sites Sacll and Not! are underlined.<br>
The oligonucleotides were used in a PCR reaction in HiFidelity™ PCR buffer (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) supplemented with 200 micro M of each dNTP, 2.6 units of HiFidelity™ Expand enzyme mix and 200 pmol of each primer. Chromosomal DNA isolated from Bacillus sp: DSM12648 as described above was used as template.<br><br>
The PCR reaction was performed using a DNA thermal cycler (Landgraf®, Germany). One incubation at 94°C for 1 min followed by ten cycles of PCR performed using a cycle profile of denaturation at 94°C for 15 sec, annealing at 60°C for 60 sec, and extension at 72CC for I20sec, followed by twenty cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 15 sec, 60CC for 60 sec and 72°C for 120 sec (at this elongation step 20 sec are added every cycle). 5 fjl aliquots of the amplification product was analysed by electrophoresis in 0.7 % agarose gels (NuSieve®, FMC). The appearance of a DNA fragment size 2.4 kb indicated proper amplification of the gene segment.<br>
Subcloning of PCR fragment:<br>
45 microL aliquots of the PCR products generated as described above were purified using QIAquick® PCR purification kit (Qiagen®, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified DNA was eluted in 50 microL of 10mM Tris-HCI, pH 8.5. 5 )jg of pMOL944 and 25 microL of the purified PCR fragment was digested with Sacll and Notl, electrophoresed in 0.7 % agarose gels (NuSieve®, FMC), the relevant fragments were excised from the gels, and purified using QIAquick® Gel extraction Kit (Qiagen®, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions. The isolated PCR DNA fragment was then iigated to the Sacil-Noti digested and purified~pMOL944. The ligation was performed overnight at 16°C using 0.5 micro g of each DNA fragment, 1 U of T4 DNA iigase and T4 ligase buffer (Boe-hringer Mannheim, Germany).<br>
The ligation mixture was used to transform competent B. subtilis PL2306. The transformed cells were plated onto LBPG-10 micro g/ml of kanamycin-agar plates. After 18 hours incubation at 37°C colonies were seen on the plates. Several clones were analyzed by isolating plasmid DNA from overnight culture broths.<br>
One such positive clone was re-streaked several times on agar plates as used above; this done was called MB1181-7. The clone MB1181-7 was grown overnight in TY-10micro g/mL kanamycin at 37°C, and next day 1 ml of cells were used to isolate a plasmid from the cells using the Qiaprep® Spin Plasmid Miniprep Kit #27106 according to the manufacturers recommendations for S. subtilis plasmid preparations. This DNA was sequenced and revealed a DNA sequence identical to the endo-glucanase gene in SEQ ID NO:1 bp 1-2322 encoding the mature endo-glucanase. The derived protein sequence is represented in SEQ ID NO: 2.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Expression and recovery of the endo-glucanase from Bacillus sp. DSM 12648<br>
MB1181-7 obtained as described in Example 1 was grown in 15 x 200 ml Cal-1,8-2 media with 10 microg/mL of kanamycin, in 500 ml_ two-baffled shake flasks, for 4 days at 37°C<br><br>
at 300 rpm, whereby about 2500 ml of culture broth was obtained. The culture fluid was floe* culated by adding 50% CaCI2(10 ml per liter of culture broth) together with 11% sodium alu-minate (10 mL per liter of culture broth), maintaining the pH between 7.0 and 7.5 by adding 20% formic acid. Cationic agent Superfloc® C521 (25 mL of a 10% v/v dilution per liter of culture broth) and anionic agent Superfloc® A130 (75 ml of a 0.1% w/v dilution in water per liter of culture broth) was added during agitation to complete the flocculation. The flocculated material was separated by centrifugation using a Sorval® RC 3B centrifuge at 10000 rpm for 30 min at 6°C. The resulting supernatant contained the endo-giucanase activity.<br>
The supernatant was clarified using Whatman glass filters GF/D and C. Then ultra-filtration was used to concentrate and reduce the ionic strength of the solution. The ultra-filtration membrane was Filtron® UF with a cut-off of 10 kDa. After ultra-filtration the solution had conductivity 
Anion-exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose® was then used for additional purification. The solution from ultra-filtration was applied to a 300 mL column containing Q-Sepharose® (Pharmacia) equilibrated with a buffer of 25 mmol Tris pH 8.0. The endo-glucanase bound to the Q-Sepharose®, and was then eluted using a 0.5 M NaCI gradient. The fractions with high endo-glucanase activity were pooled. The endo-glucanase activity of the final pooled endo-giucanase solution was approximately 1000 ECU per mL.<br>
The activity units, ECU, are determined by method SM-0302, -which is available from Novozymes A/S on request. In the ECU method the ability of the enzyme sample to reduce the viscosity of a solution of carboxymethyl-cellulose is determined, and the result is given in ECU. Conditions: CMC type 7LFD from Hercules, pH7.5 in 0.1M phosphate buffer, CMC concentration 31.1 g per liter, reaction at 40°C for 30 minutes. A vibration viscosimeter such as MIVI 3000, Sofraser®, France is used to measure the viscosity.<br>
EXAMPLE 3: Stain removal and anti-redeposition effect<br>
This test demonstrates the stain removal and anti-redeposition effects of the endo-glucanase obtained in Example 2. Additionally this test demonstrates that the enzyme performance is essentially unchanged when sodium perborate bleach is included.<br>
Cotton swatches are stained with beta-glucan (from barley) plus carbon black. Soiled swatches are washed together with clean swatches. After washing the swatches are rinsed and dried. The soil removal from the soiled switches and the soil redeposition onto the clean swatches is determined by reflectance measurements. The soil removal and soil redeposition after washing without or with addition of the endo-glucanase are compared.<br>
Swatches: Cut from 100% cotton fabric, type #2003 (Tanigashira, Osaka, Japan), pre-washed at 40°C as a precaution to remove any water soluble contaminations, size 5x5cm, weight approximately 0.3g.<br><br>
Washing equipment: Stirred beakers, beaker volume 250 mi, with temperature control oy water bath heating. The equipment is the Mini-Terg-O-Tometer, a multi-beaker miniature agitator washer, as described in the Materials and Methods section.<br>
Detergent solution: Prepared by adding the following into deionised water.<br>
Sodium carbonate, 0.5 g per liter<br>
Sodium bicarbonate, 0.7 g per iiter<br>
Ca2*/Mg2\ to give water hardness 12°dH<br>
Anionic surfactant, Surfac® SDBS80 (sodium alkylbenzene suiphonate), 0.5 g per liter<br>
Nonionic surfactant, Berol® 537 (Akzo Nobel), 1.0 g per liter<br>
Sodium perborate, type SPB from wfk Testgewebe, either 0 or 1.0 g per liter<br>
Solution pH is approximately 9.5.<br>
Washing procedure: 100mL detergent solution is added to each beaker. The water bath temperature is 40°C. The mechanical agitators are operated at approximately 125 rpm. The detergent solutions are pre-warmed for 10 minutes and then the endo-glucanase and the swatches are added. In each case three soiled swatches (prepared as described below) and three clean swatches are added to each beaker. After washing for 30 minutes, the swatches are removed from the detergent solution, rinsed under running tap water for 5 minutes, spread flat on absorbent paper and allowed to dry.<br>
.Reflectance measurements: Made using a Macbeth® 7000 Color Eye reflectance spectrophotometer. In the case of the soiled swatches, each swatch is measured once in the center of the soiled area, then the average value is calculated. In the case of the clean swatches, each swatch is measured once on each side, then the average value is calculated. The reflectance measurements are all made at 500nm.<br>
Soiled swatches: Soiled swatches are made using beta-glucan (from barley) and carbon black ("carbon for detergency tests" supplied by Sentaku Kagaku Kyokai, Tokyo, Japan). Dissolve about 0.67g of beta-glucan in 100 mL tap water by stirring and warming to &gt;50°C. Add 0.33g carbon black. Blend with an UltraTurrax® T25 blender, speed 4000 rpm for 2 minutes. Apply 250 microL of the beta-glucan/carbon onto the center of each swatch. Allow to dry overnight at room temperature.<br>
The swatches used in this example had an average reflectance value of 93.5 before soil application and 17.5 after soiling.<br>
Endo-glucanase addition: The endo-glucanase from Example 2 was added to give an activity concentration of 0, 20 cr 100 ECU per liter of detergent solution. The activity units, ECU, are determined by method SM-0302, as above.<br>
Results: Detergent without bleach (average of reflectance measurements after washing)<br><br><br>
The endo-glucanase increased the removal of soil from the fabric, as seen by the increased reflectance value of the stained swatches after washing with endo-glucanase as compared to the result after washing without endo-glucanase. The endo-glucanase also decreases the soil redeposition, as seen by the increased reflectance value of the clean swatches after washing with endo-glucanase. the improvements of soil removal and anti-redeposition provided by the endo-glucanase are essentially unchanged by the addition of the bleach.<br>
EXAMPLE 4: Anti-redeposition effect<br>
Clean cotton fabric is washed together with soile'd cotton fabric in a solution of a household detergent. The wash is carried out in a Terg-O-Tometer. During the wash, soil is released from the soiled fabric into the detergent liquor. This soil can then redeposit onto the clean cotton. After washing, the cotton fabrics are rinsed and dried, and then measured with a reflectance spectrophotometer in order to detect the degree of soil redepjosition. Detergent: Powder household detergent, Asian. Detergent concentration: 0.67g/l in water with hardness 4°dH. 1000 mL of detergent solution per T-O-T beaker. Cotton fabric: Total of 33g fabric per T-O-T beaker, comprising suitably sized pieces of:<br>
white woven cotton, #2003 (Tanigashira, Osaka, Japan), total weight 11g<br>
white cotton interlock, total weight 13g<br>
soiled cotton fabric, type EMPA101 (EMPA, Switzerland), total weight 9g. Wash: Temperature 25°C, wash time 40 minutes, at 125 rpm. After washing the #2003 cotton is rinsed under running tap water for 10 minutes, then dried.<br><br>
Reflectance measurements. The pieces of #2003 woven cotton are measured, on both sides, using a Macbeth® 70C0 reflectance spectrophotometer, 500nm. The average result for measurements from each T-O-M beaker is calculated.<br>
Enzyme addition: In this trial, the glucanase prepared as described in Example 2 was added to the detergent liquor before the start of the wash step.<br><br>
The activity units, ECU, are determined by method SM-0302, as above. From the results it can be concluded that addition of the endo-glucanase reduces the soil redeposition.<br>
