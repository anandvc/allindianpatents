				<td>Inhaler for powdered, particularly medical substances<br>
The invention relates to an inhaler for powdered,<br>
particularly medical substances, with a suction air<br>
channel leading to a mouthpiece, also a storage chamber<br>
for the substance and a linearly moved dosing chamber<br>
for apportioning a specific amount of substance from<br>
the storage chamber and bringing the amount of<br>
substance into a transfer position, for transfer to the<br>
suction air stream.<br>
An inhaler of the type in question is known from DE 10<br>
144 572 Al. The content of this patent application is<br>
hereby incorporated in full in the disclosure of the<br>
present invention, including for the purpose of<br>
incorporating features of this application in claims of<br>
the present invention.<br>
It is an object of the invention to develop an inhaler<br>
of the generic type in an advantageous way, in<br>
particular with regard to the charging of the dosing<br>
chamber by apportioning a specific amount of substance<br>
from the storage chamber.<br>
This object is achieved first and foremost by the<br>
subject matter of Claim 1, it being provided that the<br>
dosing chamber is rotationally moved in a superposed<br>
manner and is disposed eccentrically in relation to a<br>
corresponding axis of rotation. As a result of such a<br>
configuration, a structurally simple, functionally<br>
reliable inhaler is achieved, the dosing chamber of<br>
which is filled in a simple and reliable way by the<br>
rotational movement superposed on the linear movement.<br>
This is further assisted by the dosing chamber, in the<br>
course of the rotational movement with a radial spacing<br>
around the axis of rotation, being moved by the<br>
substance stored in the storage chamber to discharge in<br>
an apportioned manner a predetermined amount of<br>
substance. Discharge of a constantly equal, predefined<br>
amount of substance in an apportioned manner from the<br>
storage chamber is correspondingly effected. Once the<br>
dosing chamber has been displaced in a helical manner<br>
into the transfer position, said storage chamber is<br>
ready for the transfer to the suction air stream and<br>
the accompanying inhalation.<br>
The subject matters of the further claims are explained<br>
below with reference to the subject matter of Claim 1,<br>
but may also be of importance in their independent<br>
formulation. For instance, it is further proposed that<br>
the dosing chamber is formed in a plunger slide<br>
fashioned as a flat part. More preferably, the dosing<br>
chamber is configured here as a transverse bore in the<br>
plunger slide fashioned as a flat part. It has proven<br>
to be particularly advantageous here if, as further<br>
preferred, the plunger slide is displaceable in a<br>
manner dependent on the closure cap, so that handling<br>
in the customary way to achieve closing and opening by<br>
turning the closure cap at the same time achieves<br>
charging of the dosing chamber and a linear, superposed<br>
rotational movement of the dosing chamber into the<br>
transfer position. A particularly effective measure is<br>
obtained by a conical transverse bore to form the<br>
dosing chamber. The flat part forming the plunger<br>
slide has in cross-section an edge ratio of<br>
approximately 1:2 to 1:5. The end of this flat part<br>
that is free in the plunging direction may for example<br>
be pointed in the manner of a screwdriver blade. The<br>
fashioning of the plunger slide in the manner of a flat<br>
part achieves the effect of a rotationally loosening<br>
action in the central region of the substance stored in<br>
the storage chamber, which at the same time is<br>
conducive to the plunging of the plunger slide into the<br>
mass of powder. To stop the amount of substance that<br>
is discharged in an apportioned manner from falling out<br>
of the dosing chamber in the transfer position before<br>
it is transferred to the suction air stream, it is<br>
provided in a development of the subject matter of the<br>
invention that the plunger slide interacts outside the<br>
storage chamber with a closure plunger that is movable<br>
in relation to the plunger slide. This closure plunger<br>
is preferably linearly movable in relation to the<br>
plunger slide and is correspondingly passed through by<br>
the plunger slide fashioned as a flat part, which is a<br>
further reason for the closure plunger and the plunger<br>
slide to be disposed such that they do not rotate in<br>
relation to each other. For the transfer of the amount<br>
of substance to the suction air stream, the closure<br>
plunger must correspondingly first be displaced into a<br>
position releasing the dosing chamber for substance<br>
discharge. This is preferably performed by the closure<br>
plunger being movable into a release position with<br>
respect to the dosing chamber in dependence on a<br>
reduced suction pressure. The necessary reduced<br>
suction pressure is applied in the course of the<br>
inhalation. For this purpose, the patient places his<br>
lips around the mouthpiece of the inhaler in a manner<br>
familiar to him, in order to achieve a suction air<br>
stream in the suction air channel by inhaling. The<br>
reduced suction pressure that is automatically built up<br>
hereby is sufficient for displacing the closure plunger<br>
into the release position and subsequently clearing out<br>
the dosing chamber, and for the accompanying transfer<br>
of the amount of substance to the suction air stream.<br>
The way in which the closure plunger is disposed<br>
ensures that the partial amount discharged in an<br>
apportioned manner is supplied in the dosing chamber up<br>
until inhalation, i.e. up until transfer to the suction<br>
air stream. The release or opening of the dosing<br>
chamber takes place automatically in the course of<br>
customary handling. To further improve the<br>
distribution of the powdered substance or the<br>
apportioned amount of substance in the suction air, the<br>
so-called dispersing region, downstream of the transfer<br>
region in the direction of flow, is further formed in<br>
an advantageous way to the extent that the suction air<br>
channel has a radially outward deflection above the<br>
dosing chamber. Accordingly, before the amount of<br>
substance transferred to the suction air stream leaves,<br>
it also undergoes a deflection, this radially outward<br>
deflection also leading into an outlet portion in the<br>
region of the mouthpiece that is similar to an annular<br>
space. Correspondingly, the substance leaves in the<br>
form of a circular ring if the mouthpiece is viewed<br>
looking down on top of it. It is also proposed that<br>
the plunger slide itself forms part of the flow<br>
deflection, for instance in particular such that, in an<br>
end region facing away from the flat part having the<br>
dosing chamber and correspondingly facing toward the<br>
mouthpiece, it takes the form of a disk of a circularly<br>
round outline, which offers the radially outward<br>
deflection of the suction air channel in the transfer<br>
position.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings, which merely<br>
represent an exemplary embodiment and in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows the inhaler according to the invention<br>
in side view, enlarged, in the basic position<br>
with the cap closed;<br>
Figure 2 shows the vertical section of this;<br>
Figure 3 shows an enlargement taken from Figure 2, for<br>
the region of a dosing device;<br>
Figure 4 shows a sectional representation according to<br>
Figure 2, but with the closure cap removed<br>
and resultant displacement of the dosing<br>
chamber into the ready-to-remove position;<br>
Figure 5 shows a sectional representation<br>
corresponding to Figure 4, but representing a<br>
position in the course of inhalation;<br>
Figure 6 shows the plunger slide having the dosing<br>
chamber on its own in elevation;<br>
Figure 7 shows the side view of this;<br>
Figure 8 shows the plunger slide in a perspective<br>
representation, with a closure plunger that<br>
can be associated with it and with a sealing<br>
bush.<br>
Shown and described is an inhaler 1, which is realized<br>
as a conveniently portable pocket device in the form of<br>
a short stick, with a shape-determining stepped,<br>
cylindrical housing 2.<br>
The cylindrical housing 2, which is like a small tube,<br>
passes at the top end of the inhaler 1 into an attached<br>
mouthpiece 3, which is flattened appropriately for a<br>
mouth and can be protectively engaged over by means of<br>
a cup-shaped closure cap 4. The latter is realized as<br>
a screw cap, for which purpose an internal thread 5<br>
associated with it engages in a corresponding external<br>
thread 6 on the lateral wall of the housing 2. In the<br>
region where the mouthpiece 3 is attached, a clip 7 is<br>
integrally formed on the outer sleeve wall of the<br>
closure cap 4.<br>
At the bottom end, the end edge of the cup-shaped<br>
closure cap 4 butts with a stop-limiting and sealing<br>
effect against an annular shoulder 8, which is achieved<br>
on account of the aforementioned step of the<br>
cylindrical housing 2.<br>
The closure cap 4 serves at the same time as an<br>
actuating handle 9 for delivering a powdered substance<br>
10 in reproducible portions 10', for which purpose the<br>
axial screw stroke of the engagement of the threads 5/6<br>
is used. The substance 10 is accommodated in a storage<br>
chamber 11 of the housing 2 in an optionally refillable<br>
manner. The dosing device, transporting in each case a<br>
portion 10' to a transfer point U lying outside the<br>
storage chamber 11, is designated as a whole by D.<br>
With respect to the material that can be dosed, it is a<br>
medical, powdered substance 10. For example, basic<br>
substances capable of being transported by suction<br>
stream, such as lactose, may act as a carrier for<br>
micronized fine particles of medicament sticking to the<br>
surface.<br>
Provided downstream of the dosing device D is a socalled<br>
dispersing region, in which the user produces a<br>
suction air stream S. This completely carries away the<br>
exactly apportioned amount 10' of the substance 10 at<br>
the transfer point U. The suction air channel leading<br>
to the mouthpiece 3 is provided with the reference<br>
numeral 12.<br>
The lower termination of the storage chamber 11 is<br>
formed by a cup-shaped pressure-exerting base 13, which<br>
is under spring loading in the direction of the<br>
mouthpiece 3 by means of a compression spring 14. The<br>
compression spring 14 is supported by the bottom end<br>
turn on a base cap 15 closing the housing 2 there.<br>
Said base cap is in latching engagement with the<br>
portion of the housing 2, which is here of larger<br>
cross-section, a corresponding latching collar 16 of<br>
the base cap 15 engaging in a matching annular groove<br>
of the housing 2.<br>
The top end turn of the prestressed compression spring<br>
14 acts in loading manner on an inner shoulder 17 of a<br>
hollow piston 18 of the piston-shaped device 13/18. As<br>
can be gathered from the illustrations, the stepped<br>
cup-shaped pressure-exerting base 13 is connected in a<br>
latching manner to the inner shoulder 17 of the hollow<br>
piston 18.<br>
The cup edge of the pressure-exerting base 13 provides<br>
an annular lip 19, which on account of its rubberelastic<br>
material wipes off the wall of the storage<br>
chamber 21 without any substance being lost.<br>
A hollow standing spigot 20 extends centrally from the<br>
base cap 15. Together with the hollow piston 18<br>
surrounding it at a spacing, said standing spigot forms<br>
a spring chamber 11 for the compression spring 14.<br>
At the mouthpiece end, the storage chamber 11<br>
terminates with a cup-shaped rotary part 22, which<br>
forms by its cup base the top 23 of the storage chamber<br>
11 engaging over the housing 2.<br>
A guiding opening 24 is left at the center of the top<br>
23. This indirectly or directly formed guiding opening<br>
24 receives a plunger slide 25, as the key component of<br>
the dosing device D. As a result of being<br>
appropriately configured, said plunger slide acts as a<br>
moving dosing chamber 26 for the portion 10' to be<br>
lifted out, the movement of the plunger slide 25 taking<br>
place linearly in the longitudinal center axis x - x of<br>
the substantially rotationally symmetrically configured<br>
inhaler 1, overlaid by a rotational movement carried<br>
out about this longitudinal center axis x - x. The<br>
plunger slide 25 is fashioned substantially as a flat<br>
part with an elongate rectangular cross-section. The<br>
length ratio of the narrow side to the wide side in the<br>
exemplary embodiment represented is approximately 1:3.<br>
At the end remote from the mouthpiece 3, the plunger<br>
slide 25 forms a point similar to a screwdriver blade.<br>
The two mirror-symmetrical oblique flanks extend here<br>
from the respective wide sides of the plunger slide 25.<br>
The free end, provided with the oblique flanks, is<br>
blunted.<br>
On account of the co-rotation of the plunger slide 25,<br>
the cross-sectional configuration of the plunger slide<br>
25 and the pointing of the free end region have a<br>
loosening effect in the central region with respect to<br>
the mass of powdered substance 10.<br>
The stroke of the dosing chamber 26, moving in a linear<br>
manner with superposed rotational movement, makes<br>
allowance in both end positions of the plunger slide 25<br>
for the cross-section of the guiding opening 24 to be<br>
kept closed with a doctor-blade or wiping-off effect,<br>
filling the dosing chamber, over the length of said<br>
opening 24.<br>
The end of the closure cap 4 for the mouthpiece forms a<br>
docking point 28 between plunger slide 25 and closure<br>
cap 4 that unlatches when overloaded. The latching<br>
means on the closure cap is in this case a ring of<br>
hooks capable of resilient deflection. The<br>
corresponding end of the plunger slide 25 is fashioned<br>
in a rotationally symmetrical manner in cross-section,<br>
a disk-shaped radial collar 29 also emerging in the<br>
transitional region from the flat part portion to the<br>
cylindrical end portion. With an axial spacing in<br>
relation to this radial collar 29, the end region of<br>
the plunger slide 25 that is facing away from the flat<br>
part fashions a latching head 30. Between said<br>
latching head and the radial collar 29 there is formed<br>
a narrow waist-like annular groove 31. Inwardly<br>
directed lugs 32 of the resilient tongues of the ring<br>
of hooks engage in said annular groove. The latching<br>
head 30 can be overcome in both directions by the lugs<br>
32.<br>
The lugs 29, or their resilient tongues, are realized<br>
on a small tube 33 which protrudes into a central<br>
mouthpiece opening 3 ' and extends from the inner side<br>
of the top of the closure cap 4, at which it is rooted.<br>
The mouthpiece 3 acts via a lateral wall 34 in an<br>
anchoring manner on the neck of the housing 2. With<br>
reference to the illustrations, this anchorage is<br>
formed underneath the top 23 of the rotary part in the<br>
form of a latching point 35 between the two parts 2, 3.<br>
It may be an irreversible latching point 35. In<br>
addition, the top 23 of the rotary part 22 is engaged<br>
over in a supported manner by an annular shoulder 36 of<br>
the lateral wall 34.<br>
The central opening 3' of the mouthpiece 3 is formed in<br>
the region of a cup-shaped dispersing part 37, disposed<br>
substantially in an inverted position. This is<br>
accomplished by passing centrally through the base 38<br>
of the dispersing part. The dispersing part 37,<br>
opening in the direction of the rotary part 22, has a<br>
cup wall 39, with an outside diameter which corresponds<br>
to the outside diameter of the cup wall 40 of the<br>
rotary part 22. The cup-shaped rotary part 22 and the<br>
cup-shaped dispersing part 37 face each other with<br>
their openings, the dispersing part 37 being supported<br>
with its free annular edge on the associated annular<br>
edge of the cup wall 40 of the rotary part.<br>
Both cup walls 39 and 40 are spaced radially inward in<br>
relation to the inner wall of the lateral wall 34.<br>
Correspondingly, an annular space 41 is respectively<br>
obtained around the rotary part 22 and around the<br>
dispersing part 37.<br>
The inside diameter of the cup wall 39 of the<br>
dispersing part 37 is adapted to the outside diameter<br>
of the disk-like radial collar 29 of the plunger slide<br>
25. The latter correspondingly undergoes guidance in a<br>
linear direction in the cup-like dispersing part 37.<br>
Respectively toward their open end regions, the cup<br>
spaces both of the rotary part 22 and of the dispersing<br>
part 37 widen radially outward, with the material of<br>
the respective cup walls 39 and 40 being reduced. As a<br>
result of this configuration, a radially widened<br>
overflow region 42 is obtained.<br>
Spaced away from the cup base 38 of the dispersing part<br>
37 by approximately the material thickness of the<br>
radial collar 29 of the plunger slide 25, radial<br>
passages 43 are provided in the cup wall 39, for<br>
connecting the space inside the cup with the peripheral<br>
annular space 41. As shown, two diametrically opposed<br>
passages 43 may be provided. Alternatively, one<br>
peripheral passage, interrupted by supporting webs, may<br>
also be provided.<br>
The annular discharge space 44, surrounding the cup<br>
base 38 of the dispersing part 37, is separated from<br>
the annular space 41 extending approximately as an<br>
axial extension by a sealing collar 45, which protrudes<br>
radially outward on the cup wall 39, which sealing<br>
collar 45 is supported on the inside of the lateral<br>
wall 34. As a result of this configuration, a defined<br>
deflection of the suction air channel 12 is achieved,<br>
from the central axial alignment radially outward into<br>
the substantially axially aligned annular outlet space<br>
44.<br>
The axial lengths of the rotary part 22 and the<br>
dispersing part 37 in the region of their cup walls 39<br>
and 40 are chosen such that the powder-drawing plunging<br>
stroke of the plunger slide 25 out of a filling plane<br>
in the storage chamber 11 to the transfer point U above<br>
the top 23 is ensured.<br>
The defined ready-to-empty position of the dosing<br>
chamber 26 is obtained by an extension limiting stop of<br>
the plunger slide 25 in the region of its radial collar<br>
29 against the cup base 38 of the dispersing part 37.<br>
The dosing chamber 26 is realized as a transverse bore<br>
running substantially perpendicularly in relation to<br>
the longitudinal center axis x - x.<br>
This longitudinal center axis x - x at the same time<br>
forms the axis of rotation. The dosing chamber 26 is<br>
eccentrically disposed with respect to this axis of<br>
rotation, so furthermore passes through the wide sides<br>
of the plunger slide 25 fashioned as a flat part. As<br>
can be gathered in particular from the illustration in<br>
Figure 2, the dosing chamber 26 is disposed such that<br>
it is associated with a side edge of the wide surface,<br>
at a spacing from the free end of the plunger slide 25.<br>
In the ready-to-empty position according to Figure 4,<br>
the dosing chamber 26 is in the active region of the<br>
central suction air stream S. An air passage 46<br>
connecting with the suction air channel 12 and formed<br>
in the cup wall 40 of the rotary part 22 is associated<br>
with the dosing chamber 26. Said air passage comprises<br>
radial bores which extend in the vicinity of the base<br>
of the cup-shaped rotary part 22 with an axial spacing<br>
above the upper side of the top 23.<br>
Such an air passage 46 is provided upstream and at a<br>
radial spacing from both open ends of the dosing<br>
chamber 26. One precaution in this connection is that<br>
associated with the end of the dosing chamber 26 which<br>
is of larger clear diameter and is formed by a conical<br>
transverse bore is an air passage 46 of a smaller<br>
diameter than said larger-diameter end and associated<br>
with the end of the dosing chamber 26 which is of<br>
smaller clear diameter is an air passage 46 of a larger<br>
diameter than said smaller-diameter end. This way<br>
there is produced a greater reduced pressure with a<br>
predominant discharging effect with respect to the<br>
administered portion 10' downstream of the air passage<br>
46 of smaller diameter. Nevertheless, the discharge,<br>
i.e. emptying of the dosing chamber 26, takes place<br>
from both ends. A solution in which the air passages<br>
46 are of the same diameter is shown in the drawings.<br>
The air passages 46, formed on the cup-shaped rotary<br>
part 22 guiding the plunger slide 25, are also in flow<br>
communication with air inlets 48 spaced radially by way<br>
of a rearward annular inflow space 47. Said air inlets<br>
are also configured as bores and represent the<br>
connection to the atmosphere. The annular inflow space<br>
47 is fashioned between the outer side of the cup wall<br>
40 of the cup-shaped rotary part 22 and the inner side<br>
of the lateral wall 34 of the mouthpiece 3, as an axial<br>
extension of the annular space 41 described. A<br>
stepped, radially outwardly protruding sealing collar<br>
49 at the end facing toward the cup opening of the<br>
dispersing part 37 serves for separating the annular<br>
spaces from one another and for the radial alignment of<br>
the dispersing part 37 while supported on the inner<br>
side of the lateral wall 34. The sealing collars 49<br>
and 45 of the dispersing part 37 prevent a flow bypass<br>
between the air inlets 48 and the annular outlet space<br>
44 in the region of the mouthpiece 3.<br>
The air passages 46 are disposed axially offset in<br>
relation to the air inlets 48, the latter lying closer<br>
to the mouthpiece 3. The described spatial distancing<br>
leads to an initially contra-acting inflow of sucked-in<br>
air following on from the main suction air stream S.<br>
The guiding opening 24 for the plunger slide 25 is<br>
formed such that it has a wiping-off effect, as a<br>
result of which there is also no dosage-falsifying<br>
entrainment of powder material that may be sticking to<br>
the lateral surface of the plunger slide. The guiding<br>
opening 24 is not formed directly by the rotary part<br>
22, but by a sealing bush 50 lining this passage. Said<br>
sealing bush consists of rubber-elastic material and is<br>
held by being clipped into the top 23 by latching<br>
means.<br>
Between the rotary part 22 and the housing 2, which<br>
forms the storage chamber 11, there is likewise a<br>
sealing element. This is achieved by a sealing ring 51<br>
of rubber-elastic material inserted between the inside<br>
wall of the storage chamber 11 and the rotary part 22.<br>
Said sealing ring is fitted under preloading in annular<br>
grooves of both parts 2, 22. Both of the peripheral<br>
annular grooves, which accommodate the sealing ring 51,<br>
have a half-round cross-sectional configuration. The<br>
corresponding regions of the sealing ring 51 are<br>
correspondingly shaped.<br>
The sealing bush 50 is connected to the rotary part 22<br>
in a rotationally fixed manner. The guiding opening 24<br>
is formed in a manner adapted to the cross-sectional<br>
configuration of the plunger slide 25, likewise in an<br>
elongate rectangular fashion, and as a result of this<br>
positive engagement the plunger slide 25 is also<br>
connected to the rotary part 22 in a rotationally fixed<br>
manner.<br>
Interacting with the plunger slide 25 is a closure<br>
plunger 52, which is movable in relation to the latter<br>
outside the storage chamber 11. Said closure plunger<br>
may consist of a rubber-elastic material and is passed<br>
through centrally by the flat portion of the plunger<br>
slide 25, for which purpose the closure plunger 52 has<br>
a matched bearing opening 53, of an elongate<br>
rectangular form in outline. This bearing opening 53<br>
is slightly enlarged with respect to the crosssectional<br>
dimension of the flat portion of the plunger<br>
slide 25, as a result of which a low-friction<br>
displacement of the closure plug 52 on the plunger<br>
slide 25 is achieved.<br>
The closure plunger 52 is provided with a radially<br>
outward peripheral sealing lip 54, which in a ready-totransfer<br>
position according to the illustration in<br>
Figure 4 interacts with the inside wall of the cup wall<br>
40 of the rotary part, this being above the air<br>
passages 46 with reference to the storage chamber 11.<br>
In this ready-to-transfer position, the closure plug 52<br>
is located in a blocking manner in the suction air<br>
channel 12, with the dosing chamber 26 that is provided<br>
with the portion 10' of the substance 10 being sealed<br>
off on both sides. If the inhaler 1 is put down after<br>
it has been activated, that is to say after the plunger<br>
slide 25 with the filled dosing chamber 26 has been<br>
displaced into the ready-to-transfer position, this<br>
does not lead to loss of the apportioned amount from<br>
the dosing chamber 26 as a result of the way in which<br>
the closure plunger 52 is disposed. The closure plug<br>
52 is fashioned in a self-locking manner.<br>
The displacement of the closure plunger 52 is only<br>
possible deliberately, most easily by activation of the<br>
suction air stream S, that is to say by the customary<br>
intake of inhalation. Depending on the reduced suction<br>
pressure that this produces, the closure plunger 52 is<br>
displaced axially upward along the portion comprising<br>
the flat part of the plunger slide 25, to release the<br>
dosing chamber 26 on both sides. The closure plunger<br>
52 is hereby moved into the radially widened overflow<br>
region 42, this axial displacement being stop-limited.<br>
Serving for this purpose are axially aligned stop webs<br>
55, which extend radially inward from the inside wall<br>
of the cup wall 39 of the dispersing part and against<br>
which the annular sealing lip 54 of the closure plunger<br>
52 butts in a blocking manner. The radial spacing of<br>
the stop webs 55 from one another corresponds to the<br>
guiding cross-section of the dispersing part 37 and<br>
consequently to the outside diameter of the radial<br>
collar 29 on the plunger slide side.<br>
In the course of the inhalation - as schematically<br>
represented in Figure 5 - flow passes around the<br>
closure plunger 52, lying in the region 42 of the<br>
mouthpiece 3.<br>
Conducive to the emptying of the storage chamber 11 is<br>
the way in which the powdered substance 10 is kept<br>
ready in the drawing region. Conditions are created to<br>
ensure an isostructural or homogeneous filling of the<br>
dosing chamber 26, fed from a surrounding region where<br>
the substance has been loosened. The rotary part 22 is<br>
used in particular for this purpose. It has a rotor R<br>
acting in the upper region of the storage chamber 11.<br>
Using the rotation of the rotary part 22, a loosening<br>
of the stored substance is obtained. Rotor blades 56<br>
form a scoop. In this respect, two rotor blades 56 may<br>
be provided, disposed diametrically opposite with<br>
respect to the longitudinal center axis x - x of the<br>
inhaler 1. The freely extending rotor blades 56<br>
protruding from the base or the top 23 of the rotary<br>
part 22 on the storage chamber side are positioned<br>
diametrically opposite in such a way that they are<br>
sufficiently spaced apart in the circumferential<br>
direction. Geometrically, they may substantially take<br>
up a quarter sector of the circular cross-section of<br>
the storage chamber 11.<br>
In interaction with the plunger slide 25 fashioned as a<br>
flat part, the way in which the rotor blades 56 are<br>
disposed always achieves a surrounding region where the<br>
substance has been loosened. Furthermore, the way in<br>
which the dosing chamber 26 is disposed eccentrically<br>
in relation to the axis of rotation of the plunger<br>
slide 25 achieves optimum filling of the same by means<br>
of plunging helically through the mass of substance.<br>
The co-rotation between the mouthpiece 3 and the<br>
closure cap 4, lifting off by an unscrewing action,<br>
takes place by a claw coupling 57 between the two.<br>
This comprises a longitudinal toothing 58 on the<br>
lateral wall 34 of the mouthpiece 3, which longitudinal<br>
toothing 58 engages in corresponding tooth gaps 59 on<br>
the inner side of the closure cap 4.<br>
As the closure cap 4 is lifted off by an unscrewing<br>
action, the claw coupling 57 causes a co-rotation of<br>
the rotary part 22 and of the parts entrained by it,<br>
such as the sealing bush 50, the closure plug 52 and<br>
the plunger slide 25, an axial displacement of the<br>
plunger slide 25, brought about by the screw-effected<br>
lifting-off displacement of the closure cap 4, being in<br>
addition effected by the docking point 28, this axial<br>
displacement bringing about a screw-thread-like<br>
displacement of the dosing chamber 26 to the transfer<br>
point U, that is to say into the ready-to-transfer<br>
position according to the illustration in Figure 4.<br>
In the course of the linear displacement of the plunger<br>
slide 25, the closure plug 52 remains in its sealing<br>
position, supporting itself on the top 23 of the rotary<br>
part 22.<br>
The standing spigot 20 rooted at the base 15 of the<br>
housing 2 is closed at the end by a screen-like cover<br>
60. In the delimited space created as a result, a<br>
moisture-absorbing material 61 is held.<br>
The plunger slide 25 can be varied with respect to the<br>
volume of its dosing chamber 26. All that is necessary<br>
for this is to exchange the key component of the dosing<br>
device D, that is the plunger slide 25, to achieve a<br>
different, precisely reproducible dosing of portions<br>
10' .<br>
The pressure-exerting base 13, acting in the manner of<br>
a plunger, is not impaired in its ability to move with<br>
respect to the cylinder space, which is provided by the<br>
central portion of the housing 2, since there the<br>
housing has an air-equalizing opening 62 lying to the<br>
rear of the annular lip 19.<br>
The cup-shaped pressure-exerting base 13 has a central<br>
indentation, directed away from the storage chamber 11.<br>
It is of such a depth on the inside that the end<br>
portion of the plunger slide 25 projecting axially<br>
downward beyond the rotor blades 56 in the basic<br>
position is accommodated in it.<br>

the invention. The disclosure content of the<br>
associated/accompanying priority documents (copy of the<br>
