Improved  process  for  continuously  preparing  alkyl (meth)acrylates with repeated catalyst recycling<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a further improved continuous process for preparing alkyl (meth)acrylates (C) by continuously transesterifying methyl (meth)acrylate (A) with alcohols (B) to release methanol (D) according to the following reaction equation:<br><br>
where R2 is a linear, branched or cyclic alkyl radical or aryl radical having 2 to 12 carbon atoms.

also be substituted by one or more short-chain alkyl<br>
groups, for example methyl, ethyl or propyl.<br>
In the process according to the invention, preference is given to using n-butanol, isobutanol and 2-ethylhexanol.<br>
The improvement over the prior art is that the homogeneous tetraalkyl titanate (tetraalkoxytitanium) catalyst which is used with preference can surprisingly be used repeatedly by recycling. This decisively reduces the catalyst consumption and consequently the costs of the auxiliaries, which again distinctly increases the economic viability of the process.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Alkyl (meth)acrylates can be prepared continuously in various    methods    by    transesterifying    methyl (meth)acrylate in the presence of catalysts.<br>
EP 0 960 877 (Elf Atochem S.A.) describes a continuous process for preparing methacrylate esters of dialkylamino alcohols. Dialkylamino alcohols are generally reacted with methyl (meth)acrylate to obtain the dialkylaminoalkyl (meth)acrylate by the following process:<br>
The   mixture   of   starting   materials    (methyl (meth)acrylate    and   dialkylamino    alcohol)    is<br><br>
continuously fed to a stirred reactor together with a homogeneous tetraalkyl titanate transesterification catalyst (for example tetrabutyl titanate, tetraethyl titanate or tetra(2-ethylhexyl) titanate) and at least one polymerization inhibitor (for example phenothiazine, tert-butylcatechol, hydroquinone monomethyl ether or hydroquinone), and the conversion to the dialkylamino (meth)acrylate is effected in the stirred reactor at a temperature of 9O-120°C while continuously   removing   the   azeotropic   methyl<br>
(meth)acrylate/methanol mixture. The crude reaction mixture (crude ester) is fed to a first distillation column in which, under reduced pressure, a substantially catalyst-free stream is withdrawn overhead, and the catalyst and also a little dialkyl-aminoalkyl (meth)acrylate are removed at the bottom of the distillation column. The top stream of the first distillation column is then fed to a second distillation column in which, under reduced pressure, a stream of low-boiling products comprising a little dialkylaminoalkyl (meth)acrylate is withdrawn overhead and a stream consisting mainly of dialkylaminoalkyl<br>
(meth)acrylate and also polymerization inhibitor(s) is removed at the bottom and is fed to a third distillation column. In the third distillation column, a rectification is carried out under reduced pressure in   which   the   desired   pure   dialkylaminoalkyl<br>
(meth)acrylate ester is withdrawn overhead and essentially the polymerization inhibitor or the polymerization inhibitors are withdrawn at the bottom. After further purification with the aid of a film evaporator, the bottom stream of the first distillation column is recycled into the reactor, like the top stream from the second distillation column. A detailed description of the procedure for recycling the homogeneous catalyst is not specified. It can merely be discerned from the specified purification of the bottom effluent of the first distillation column using   a   film   evaporator   that   the   remaining<br><br>
dialkylaminoalkyl (meth)acrylate is removed from the catalyst and also high-boiling secondary components, and recycled into the reactor.<br>
EP 0 968 995 (Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Comp.) describes a continuous process for preparing alkyl(meth)acrylic esters using a reaction column. The transesterification is effected directly within a distillation column (i.e. reactor and distillation column for removing the methyl<br>
(meth)acrylate/methanol azeotrope form one apparatus), into   which   the   starting   materials    (methyl<br>
(meth)acrylate and alcohol) are fed continuously. The necessary catalyst, here likewise preferably a titanium compound, is in the distillation column. In the case of a homogeneous catalyst, the catalyst is continuously metered into the distillation column. However, owing to the flushing effect of the liquid reflux in a distillation column, the use of homogeneous catalysts in the distillation column leads to an increased catalyst requirement and also, when a solid catalyst precipitate occurs, to fouling of the column internals. In the case of a heterogeneous catalyst, the catalyst is in the reaction column. However, the positioning of the catalyst in the distillation column is disadvantageous because an increased pressure drop then occurs in the distillation column and very high additional cost and inconvenience are associated with regular cleaning of the distillation column. Also, heterogeneous catalysts may deactivate, for example as a consequence of undesired polymerization.<br>
No information is given on the procedure for recycling a homogeneous catalyst into the reaction column after removing crude ester beforehand.<br>
Compared to the aforementioned processes, the German patent application no. 102 00 171.5 describes a distinctly improved continuous process for preparing alkyl   (meth)acrylates  by  transesterifying  methyl<br><br>
(meth)acrylate with alcohols having a higher boiling point than methanol (cf. Figure 1).<br>
The reactants methyl (meth)acrylate (MMA, 11) and alcohol (12) are fed continuously to a suitable reaction apparatus (1) which may be either a single reaction tank or else a battery of two or more reaction tanks connected in series. It is sensible that all reaction tanks should have a vapour takeoff to the azeotrope distillation column (2) for removing the methanol released in the reaction. The homogeneous tetraalkyl titanate catalyst which is used with preference (the tetraalkoxytitanium content relative to MMA used is preferably 0.2-O.5% by weight) is metered continuously into the reaction apparatus (1), as is/are the polymerization inhibitor(s). However, the transesterification catalysts used may also be any transesterification catalysts disclosed by the prior art. Examples of polymerization inhibitors include hydroquinone monomethyl ether in combination with oxygen. Since the alcohol used may contain water (the amount of water in the alcohol used in the case of n-butanol is between 0.05-O.005% by weight), preference is given to distillatively dewatering the alcohol using the azeotrope column (2) before entry into the reaction apparatus. The water contained in the alcohol is removed overhead. To avoid contamination of the methanol/MMA azeotrope (13) with the alcohol used, the alcohol is preferably added in the lower section of the distillation column (2). However, the alcohol used may also be dewatered by using an upstream dewatering distillation column, by treating with a dewatering agent, for example a molecular sieve, or by a membrane separating process, for example a pervaporation. The dewatering is significant because the water contained in the alcohol can lead to irreversible damage of the catalyst (for example tetraalkyl titanate) in the reactor. This dewatering step avoids the hydrolysis of the catalyst and the costs resulting from increased<br><br>
catalyst use quantities and from problems with solid precipitates. The reaction is effected in the reaction apparatus at a temperature in the range of 80 to 160°C. Preference is given to the temperature range of 110 to 135°C. To positively influence the reaction equilibrium, the methanol released in the reaction is removed from the reaction mixture as an azeotrope with MMA (13) using the distillation column (2) . The reaction mixture which consists predominantly of the product alkyl (meth)acrylate, unconverted MMA and alcohol and also small amounts of methanol, the catalyst, the polymerization inhibitors and a very low proportion of by-products is fed to a continuously operated low boiler distillation column (3) after about 0.5-3 hours of reactor residence time (preference is given to a residence time of 0.75-1.5 hours). Components which are low-boiling relative to the product ester, predominantly methanol, MMA and unconverted reactant alcohol, are removed there under reduced pressure, preferably in the range of 2O-200 mbar. These components are removed overhead in the distillation column and recycled into the reactor region (14) . This cycle stream guarantees that, based on the overall process, there is virtually complete conversion with regard to the reactants MMA and alcohol. The crude ester (15) which is obtained at the bottom of the distillation column (3) and is still contaminated with catalyst, polymerization inhibitor and high-boiling by-products preferably comprises &gt; 98% by weight of product ester and is fed continuously for workup to a further vacuum distillation stage (4, 5) which operates in the preferred pressure range of 20 to 200 mbar. The highly pure product ester is continuously distillatively removed here as the top product (16) . When a conventional vacuum distillation column as described in the prior art is used for removing the catalyst and the polymerization inhibitors and also the high-boiling by-products from the crude ester (15) , impermissibly high thermal stress in the bottom of the<br><br>
column results in decomposition of the catalyst and therefore release of the reactant alcohol and sometimes also the formation of ethers of the reactant alcohol. Both compounds (reactant alcohol and ether of the reactant alcohol) are low-boiling components with respect to the product ester and therefore occur as an impurity in the product ester, which distinctly reduces the product quality. This problem may be solved by using an apparatus having gentle film evaporation (5) to remove the product ester from the catalyst and the polymerization inhibitors and also the high-boiling byproducts. Useful apparatus for this purpose include falling-film, thin-film and short-path evaporators. A further downstream high boiler distillation stage (4) serves to achieve the highest product ester purity (product ester &gt; 99.9% by weight, alcohol 
 <br>
boiling components, the product ester removed overhead in the evaporation stage does not fulfil the required specification for the pure product ester. Furthermore, owing to the thermal decomposition of the catalyst, it also contains reactant alcohol and sometimes also ethers of the reactant alcohol. For these reasons, the aim of recovering the product ester from the distillate stream cannot be achieved by recycling it directly into the high boiler distillation column (4), but rather by recycling to the reaction apparatus (1) or advantageously to the low boiler distillation column (3) in order to remove the low boilers before the first evaporation stage (5) .<br>
The process has the disadvantage that the partly inactive, homogeneous catalyst which has been repeatedly thermally stressed and is therefore possibly damaged, after it has been removed from the product ester, is discharged in its entirety with the polymerization inhibitors and high-boiling by-products and is not reused by recycling- As a consequence of the relatively high catalyst cost, this leads to increased costs of auxiliaries.<br>
DE 101 27 939 (BASF) describes a continuous transesterification process. The formulation of one of the partial objects to be achieved is that the catalyst should be reusable without any problem.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process which is free of said weaknesses and fulfills the following criteria:<br>
1.	The starting materials (catalyst, stabilizer, lower (meth)acrylate) should be economical, easy to handle  and  available  in  industrial  quantity.<br>
2.	The catalyst should be stable at elevated temperatures and in the presence of small amounts of water.<br><br>
The loss of activity of the catalyst should be small and said catalyst should be capable of being reused without problems.<br>
No alcohol foreign to the system should be introduced into the transesterification via the transesterification catalyst.<br>
Long times-on-stream of the plant, i.e. very few polymerization problems and use of apparatuses which require very little repair.<br>
Direct reuse or utilization of the resulting mixture or azeotropic mixture of lower alkanol and the corresponding ester.<br>
Substantial recovery of the remaining useful products from the waste streams and from the byproducts .<br>
The transesterification should preferably be operated continuously.<br>
The desired ester should have a high purity (at least 99.9%) and, in the case of the preparation of the dialkylaminomethyl (meth)acrylates, the formation of ethylene glycol di(meth)acrylate and vinyloxyethyl (meth)acrylate should be reduced, as far as possible, to below 100 ppm.<br>
The amounts of waste should be very small and easy to handle.<br>
Conversion and yield should be high (&gt; 95%) .<br>
The residence times should be short.<br>
The overall process should be technically simple and economical.<br><br>
Although this object is formulated, there are no indications in the description of selective recycling of the active or semiactive catalyst. Further, there is no information on the numerical ratios in the recycling of the catalyst or information on any changes in the product quality when a fully or partly recycled transesterification catalyst is used.<br>
Object<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a continuous process for transesterifying methyl (meth)aerylate (A) with alcohols (B) having a higher boiling point than methanol (D) , in which the homogeneous catalyst used can be used repeatedly by partial recycling. In this context, (meth)acrylic esters or alkyl (meth)acrylates refer hereinbelow to esters and derivatives of acrylic acid and of methacrylic acid. In addition, the novel process should provide a product whose quality is better than that of those already on the market. The novel process should further allow alkyl (meth)acrylates to be prepared in a very uncomplicated and energetically more efficient manner using a smaller amount of auxiliary (i.e. more cost-effectively) . This object, and also further objects which are not specifically illustrated in more detail but which can be inferred or derived without further information from the introductory discussion of the prior art, are achieved by a process as illustrated hereinbelow.<br>
Solution<br>
Starting from the prior art established by Rohm (DE 102 00   171.5),   it   has   been   found   that,<br>
surprisingly, the homogeneous tetraalkyl titanate (tetraalkoxytitanium)  catalyst  which  is  used  with<br>
preference still has considerable activity at various<br>
points in the process despite thermal stress in the<br><br>
column bottoms and film evaporators. Repeated use of the catalyst over and above simple run-through is therefore possible. This allows the costs of auxiliaries to be distinctly reduced with unchanged product qualities and unchanged space-time and overall yields. For this purpose, all that is additionally required is a liquid stream divider and a pump. The amount of catalyst which is recycled is controlled with the aid of alcohol (B) or MMA (A) conversion in the reaction apparatus (1) as a measure of the current catalyst activity. A further indicator which can be used for the current catalyst activity is the amount and composition of the low boiler cycle stream (14). For the industrial implementation of the catalyst recycling, the following solution variants are possible in principle:<br>
Solution variant 1 (Figure 2):<br>
The bottom effluent of the vacuum evaporation stage (6) which comprises the catalyst, polymerization inhibitors, and also high-boiling by-products and residual product ester is divided and recycled partly (18) to the reaction apparatus (1). The remaining residual stream is discharged (17). The discharge (17) is in proportion to the steady-state amount of high-boiling secondary components which has been formed and in proportion to the remaining residual activity of the catalyst in the bottom effluent of the vacuum evaporation stage (6) . The fresh amount of catalyst in the stream (11) is reduced in proportion to the recycled amount of catalyst compared to the operation without catalyst recycling.<br>
The recycled stream  (18)  is between 1 and 95% by weight, preferably between 4 0 and 90% by weight and . most preferably between 60 and 85% by weight, of the bottom effluent from the vacuum evaporation stage (6).<br><br>
Solution variant 2 (Figure 3):<br>
The bottom effluent from the apparatus employing gentle film evaporation (5) which remains after the highly pure product ester has been removed and comprises the catalyst, polymerization inhibitors and also high-boiling by-products and residual product ester is divided and recycled in part (18) into the reaction apparatus (1). The remaining residual stream is fed to a vacuum evaporation stage (6) in accordance with the prior art, where the majority of the product ester is removed and recycled to the reaction apparatus (1) or advantageously to the low boiler distillation column (3) . The bottom effluent of the vacuum evaporation stage (6) which comprises the catalyst, polymerization inhibitors and also high-boiling by-products and residual product ester is discharged (17). The discharge (17) is in proportion to the steady-state amount of high-boiling secondary components which has been formed and is in proportion to the remaining residual activity of the catalyst in the bottom effluent of the vacuum distillation stage (4, 5). The fresh amount of catalyst in stream (11) is reduced in proportion to the amount of catalyst which is recycled compared to the operation without catalyst recycling.<br>
The recycle stream (18) is between 1 and 95% by weight, preferably between  40  and  90%  by weight  and most preferably between 60 and 85% by weight, of the bottom effluent from the film evaporator (5).<br>

Examples:<br>
The process according to the invention is illustrated in detail by the examples which follow, without being restricted to them.<br>
The examples cited were carried out in an experimental plant on the pilot scale (throughput per hour: 6 - 8 kg of feed (MMA and alcohol) and 5 - 6 kg of product ester) . The construction of the experimental plant was as illustrated in Figure 3 or in slightly modified form.<br>
(Comparative) Example 1: no   recycling of the catalyst (n-/i-butyl methacrylate preparation).<br><br>
The reaction apparatus (1) used was a steam-heated stainless steel reaction tank having a maximum fill volume of 15 1. The reactor was connected via a vapour line to an azeotrope distillation column (2) mounted above. The azeotrope distillation column (top pressure = 1 barabs) was a pilot plant glass column having a diameter D = 0.1 m and packed with Sulzer CY structured metal gauze packings of H = 2 m. The feed for the reactant alcohol was disposed in the middle of the column (H - 1 m) . The reactor effluent was fed continuously to a low boiler distillation column (3) . This distillation column was a pilot plant vacuum glass column (top pressure = 120 mbarabs) having a diameter D = 0.1 m and packed with Sulzer CY structured metal gauze packings of H = 3.8 m. The feed was at H = 2 m. The bottom was heated by means of steam. The condensed top takeoff (cycle stream) (14) was recycled continuously to the reactor. Instead of the falling-film evaporator (5) shown in Figure 3, the continuous workup of the bottom effluent of the low boiler distillation column (15) was carried out using a thermal oil-heated glass thin-film evaporator having an evaporator surface area A = 0.1m2. The vapours of this glass thin-film evaporator were passed continuously into a high boiler distillation column (4) mounted above. This was a pilot plant vacuum glass column (top pressure = 120 mbarabs) having a diameter D = 0.05 m and packed with Sulzer EX structured metal gauze packings of H = 0.5 m. The bottom effluent was fed continuously to a second, smaller, likewise thermal oil-heated glass thin-film evaporator (6) (top pressure = 120 mbarabs) having an evaporator surface area A = 0.02 m2. The vapours of this second glass thin-film evaporator were condensed out and, combined with the reactor effluent, fed continuously to the low boiler distillation column. The bottom effluent (17) was continuously discharged from the process. The reactants (MMA and alcohol) were metered in continuously by means of piston metering pumps, and the catalyst (tetraalkyl<br><br>
titanate) was metered in dissolved in (water-free as per the specification) MMA feed. The MMA/catalyst feed was fed directly to the reactor, and the alcohol feed introduced preheated (to the internal column temperature) to the middle of the azeotrope distillation column. The continuous addition of 5O-100 g/h of stabilizer solution (0.2% by weight of hydroquinone monomethyl ether in MMA or product ester) into the reflux stream of the distillation columns was effected with the aid of hose pumps. The continuous conveyance of the streams between the parts of the plant was effected either with the aid of piston metering pumps or by the sucking effect of the vacuum. Intermediate vessels (buffer volumes) were avoided as far as possible. The composition of the streams (MMA, alcohol, MeOH and product ester content) was determined with the aid of a gas chromatograph.<br>
To continuously prepare n-butyl methacrylate (n-BuMA), 4 kg/h of MMA feed, 18 g/h of tetra-n-butyl titanate (Ti (n-OBu) 4) and 2.7 kg/h of n-BuOH feed were metered into the reaction tank (11) . The recycle stream from the top of the low boiler distillation column also flowed continuously into the reactor (2.8 kg/h having the following composition: 1.0% by weight of n-BuMA, 38.3% by weight of n-BuOH, 57.3% by weight of MMA and 3.4% by weight of MeOH). The molar MMA:n-BuOH ratio in the reactor feed was 1.1:1. At a reactor residence time of 1 h and an MMA/MeOH azeotrope takeoff of 1.5 kg/h, a reactor temperature of 115°C was attained. The composition of the MMA/MeOH azeotrope was 82% by weight of MeOH, 18% by weight of MMA and 
 <br>
the bottom effluent of the low boiler distillation column was a crude ester (5.8 kg/h) which already contained &gt; 99.5% by weight of n-BuMA and also all of the catalyst and the stabilizer. The yield of n-BuOH based on the overall process was therefore virtually 100%. The yield of MMA based on the overall process minus the MMA loss via the MMA/MeOH azeotrope calculated beforehand was likewise virtually 100%. At an evaporation ratio (ratio of vapour stream to feed stream) in the first, larger thin-film evaporator of about 90%, 5.1 kg/h of pure n-BuMA are finally obtained at the top of the high boiler distillation column and have the following composition: &gt; 99.92% by weight of n-BuMA, 
The catalyst consumption is 3.5 g of tetra-n-butyl titanate/kg of pure n-BuMA.<br>
To continuously prepare isobutyl methacrylate (i-BuMA), 3.4 kg/h of MMA feed, 19 g/h of tetra-i-butyl titanate (Ti (i-OBu) 4) and 2.36 kg/h of i-BuOH feed were metered into the reaction tank. The recycle stream from the top of the low boiler distillation column also flowed continuously into the reactor (2.4 kg/h having the following composition: 6.2% by weight of i-BuMA, 35.3% by weight of i-BuOH, 56.3% by weight of MMA and 2.2% by weight of MeOH). The molar MMA:i-BuOH ratio in the reactor feed was 1.1:1. At a reactor residence time of 1.2 h and an MMA/MeOH azeotrope takeoff of 1.26 kg/h, a reactor temperature of 115°C was attained. The composition of the MMA/MeOH azeotrope was 82% by weight of MeOH, 18% by weight of MMA and 
 <br>
The resulting reactor effluent of 6.9 kg/h had the following composition: 67.3% by weight of i-BuMA, 12.0% by weight of i-BuOH, 19.4% by weight of MMA, 0.8% by weight of MeOH and 0.5% by weight of by-products. The space-time yield of the reactor based on i-BuMA was therefore 516 kg/h/m3. Owing to virtually complete removal of low-boiling components relative to i-BuMA, the bottom effluent of the low boiler distillation column was a crude ester (5.0 kg/h) which already contained &gt; 99.5% by weight of i-BuMA and also all of the catalyst and the stabilizer. The yield of i-BuOH based on the overall process was therefore virtually 100%. The yield of MMA based on the overall process minus the MMA loss via the MMA/MeOH azeotrope calculated beforehand was likewise virtually 100%. At an evaporation ratio (ratio of vapour stream to feed stream) in the first, larger thin-film evaporator of about 90%, 4.5 kg/h of pure i-BuMA are finally obtained at the top of the high boiler distillation column and have the following composition: &gt; 99.9% by weight of i-BuMA, 
The catalyst consumption is 4.2 g of tetra-i-butyl titanate/kg of pure i-BuMA.<br>
Example 2: Complete recycling of the catalyst (n-butyl methacrylate preparation)<br>
The reaction apparatus (1) used was a steam-heated stainless steel reaction tank having a maximum fill volume of 15 1. The reactor was connected via a vapour line to an azeotrope distillation column (2) mounted<br><br>
above. The azeotrope distillation column (top pressure = 1 barabs) was a pilot plant glass column having a diameter D = 0.1 m and packed with Sulzer CY structured metal gauze packings of H = 2 m. The feed for the react ant alcohol was disposed in the middle of the column (H = 1 m) . The reactor effluent was fed continuously to a low boiler distillation column (3). This distillation column was a pilot plant vacuum glass column (top pressure = 120 mbarabs) having a diameter D = 0.1 m and packed with Sulzer CY structured metal gauze packings of H = 3.8 m. The feed was at H = 2 m. The bottom was heated by means of steam. The condensed top takeoff (cycle stream) (14) was recycled continuously to the reactor. Instead of the falling-film evaporator (5) shown in Figure 3, the continuous workup of the bottom effluent of the low boiler distillation column (15) was carried out using a thermal oil-heated glass thin-film evaporator having an evaporator surface area A = 0.1 m2. The vapours of this glass thin-film evaporator were passed continuously into a high boiler distillation column (4) mounted above. This was a pilot plant vacuum glass column (top pressure = 150 mbarabs) having a diameter D = 0.05 m and packed with Sulzer EX structured metal gauze packings of H = 0.5 m. The bottom effluent was continuously recycled into the reaction tank (18) and also partly discharged continuously from the process (17). At time t = 0 h, the bottom effluent was recycled fully and continuously into the reaction tank (18) and there was no longer any discharge (17) nor fresh catalyst metering. The reactants (MMA and alcohol) were metered in continuously by means of piston metering pumps, and the catalyst (tetraalkyl titanate) was metered in dissolved in (water-free as per the specification) MMA feed. The MMA/catalyst feed was fed directly to the reactor, and the alcohol feed introduced preheated (to the internal column temperature) to the middle of the azeotrope distillation column.  The continuous addition of 5O-<br><br>
100 g/h of stabilizer solution (0.2% by weight of hydroquinone monomethyl ether in MMA or product ester) into the reflux stream of the distillation columns was effected with the aid of hose pumps. The continuous conveyance of the streams between the parts of the plant was effected either with the aid of piston metering pumps or by the sucking effect of the vacuum-Intermediate vessels (buffer volumes) were avoided as far as possible. The composition of the streams (MMA, alcohol, MeOH and product ester content) was determined with the aid of a gas chromatograph.<br>
To continuously prepare n-butyl methacrylate (n-BuMA), 3.8 kg/h of MMA feed, 18 g/h of tetra-n-butyl titanate (Ti(n-OBu)4) and 2.7 kg/h of n-BuOH feed were initially metered into the reaction tank. The recycle stream from the top of the low boiler distillation column also flowed continuously into the reactor (3.0 kg/h having the following composition: 0.2% by weight of n-BuMA, 31.1% by weight of n-BuOH, 66.4% by weight of MMA and 1.9% by weight of MeOH). The molar MMA:n-BuOH ratio in the reactor feed was 1.2:1. At a reactor residence time of 1 h and an MMA/MeOH azeotrope takeoff of 1.4 kg/h, a reactor temperature of 115°C was attained. The composition of the MMA/MeOH azeotrope was 80.4% by weight of MeOH, 19.6% by weight of MMA and 
 <br>
and the catalyst was recycled approx. 8 times through the overall process.<br>
Example 3: Partial recycling of the catalyst (i-butyl methacrylate preparation)<br>
The reaction apparatus (1) used was a steam-heated stainless steel reaction tank having a maximum fill volume of 15 1. The reactor was connected via a vapour line to an azeotrope distillation column (2) mounted above. The azeotrope distillation column (top pressure = 1 barabs) was a pilot plant glass column having a diameter D = 0.1 m packed with Sulzer CY structured metal gauze packings of H = 2 m. The feed for the reactant alcohol was disposed in the middle of the column (H = 1 m) . The reactor effluent was fed continuously to a low boiler distillation column (3) . This distillation column was a pilot plant vacuum glass column (top pressure = 120 mbarabs) having a diameter D = 0.1m packed with Sulzer CY structured metal gauze packings of H = 3.8 m. The feed was at H = 2 m. The bottom was heated by means of steam. The condensed top takeoff (cycle stream) (14) was recycled continuously to the reactor. Instead of the falling-film evaporator (5) shown in Figure 3, the continuous workup of the bottom effluent of the low boiler distillation column (15) was carried out using a thermal oil-heated glass thin-film evaporator having an evaporator surface area A = 0.1 m2. The vapours of this glass thin-film evaporator were passed continuously into a high boiler distillation column (4) mounted above. This was a pilot plant vacuum glass column (top pressure = 150 mbarat,s) having a diameter D = 0.05 m packed with Sulzer EX structured metal gauze packings of H = 0.5 m. The bottom effluent was divided and partly recycled (18) continuously into the reaction tank and also partly discharged continuously from the process (17). The reactants (MMA and alcohol) were metered in continuously by means of piston metering pumps, and the<br><br>
atalyst (tetraalkyl titanate) was metered in dissolved<br>
n (water-free as per the specification) MMA feed. The<br>
IMA/catalyst feed was fed directly to the reactor, and<br>
.he alcohol feed introduced preheated (to the internal<br>
:olumn temperature)  to the middle of the azeotrope<br>
listillation column.  The continuous addition of 5O-<br>
-O0 g/h of stabilizer solution  (0.2% by weight  of<br>
\ydroquinone monomethyl ether in MMA or product ester)<br>
Lnto the reflux stream of the distillation columns was<br>
affected with the aid of hose pumps. The continuous<br>
conveyance of the streams between the parts of the<br>
plant was  effected either with the  aid  of piston<br>
netering pumps or by the sucking effect of the vacuum.<br>
Intermediate vessels (buffer volumes) were avoided as<br>
far as possible. The composition of the streams (MMA,<br>
alcohol, MeOH and product ester content) was determined<br>
with the aid of a gas chromatography<br>
To continuously prepare isobutyl methacrylate (i-BuMA), 2.78 kg/h of MMA feed, 3 g/h of tetra-i-butyl titanate (Ti (i-OBu) 4) and 1.9 kg/h of i-BuOH feed were metered into the reaction tank. The recycle stream from the top of the low boiler distillation column also flowed continuously into the reactor (2.2 kg/h having the following composition: 2.8% by weight of i-BuMA, 39.3% by weight of i-BuOH, 56.2% by weight of MMA and 1.7% by weight of MeOH). The molar MMA:i-BuOH ratio in the reactor feed was 1.1:1. At a reactor residence time of 1.2 h and an MMA/MeOH azeotrope takeoff of 1.04 kg/h, a reactor temperature of 116°C was attained. The composition of the MMA/MeOH azeotrope was 7 9% by weight of MeOH, 21% by weight of MMA and 
 <br>
the bottom effluent of the low boiler distillation column was a crude ester (4.25 kg/h) which already contained &gt; 99.5% by weight of i-BuMA and also all of the catalyst and the stabilizer. The yield of i-BuOH based on the overall process was therefore virtually 100%. The yield of MMA based on the overall process minus the MMA loss via the MMA/MeOH azeotrope calculated beforehand was likewise virtually 100%. At an evaporation ratio (ratio of vapour stream to feed stream) in the thin-film evaporator of about 90%, 3.81 kg/h of pure i-BuMA are finally obtained at the top of the high boiler distillation column and have the following composition: &gt; 99.9% by weight of i-BuMA, 
Compared to Example 1, the catalyst saving is therefore approx. 80%.<br><br>
