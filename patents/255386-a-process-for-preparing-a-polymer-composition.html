				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparing a polymer composition.<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/534,873, filed January 8, 2004.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to paint compositions using colorant compatible synthetic thickeners. More specifically, the invention relates to the use in paint compositions a synthetic thickener with a water-soluble or water-swellabie polymer backbone that has terminal groups of hydrophobes of oligomers of alkyl-or aryl compounds containing a polymerizable cyclic monomer (i.e., an epoxide, a gfycidyl ether, a cyclic oxide, an oxazoiine) or a polymerizable double bond (i.e., styrene, vinyl ether, acrylamides, acrylates), or derivatives thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hydrophobically modified water-soluble polymers of various types have been used to thicken latex paints to provide a certain performance during manufacturing, storage, and applications. Some of these properties include: ease of formulation, pigment settling prevention, film buiid during application, spatter resistance, low sag, good flow, and leveling of the paint film. These water-soluble polymers may come from a natural source like cellulose, starch, polydextran, guar gum or their ionic and non-ionic derivatives (hydroxy ethyl, hydroxypropyl). Some examples of synthetic water-soluble polymers are the polyacrylamides, polyacrylates, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl sulfonates, polyethylene imine, polydadmac, polyamideazetidinium ion, polyvinylpyrolidone, pofyaspartates, polyacetalpolyether, polyalkylethers, and polyalkylthioethers. Most of the water soluble polymer types are described in "Water soluble polymers" by Yale Meltzer (Noyes Data Corporation, Parkridge, New Jersey, USA, 1981).<br><br>
The hydrophobe attachment is usually done with a single alkyl group or an alkyl phenol ethoxylate bearing a halide or an epoxide. There are also examples where the hydrophobe is bunched together before the attachment as in USP 4,426,485, USP application 0045724 A1 (2002), USP 5,292,828, and USP 6337366. In these patents, the hydrophobes are pre-connected with each other via a connecting reagent such as diisocyanate, diepoxide, epichlorohydrin or a primary amine.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a polymer composition comprising a water soluble or water swellable synthetic polymer backbone that has covalently connected ends and/or intermediate blocks of pligomeric hydrophobes that are selected from the group consisting of i) alkyl and aryl moieties containing a polymerizable cyclic monomer, ii) a polymerizable double bond, and iii) derivatives of i) and ii), wherein the blocks are two or more units of the same or different hydrophobes.<br>
The present invention also comprehends a process for preparing the water soluble or water swellable polymer composition mentioned above comprising<br>
a)	reacting a water soluble or water swellable backbone polymer with a catalyzing agent in order to activate the polymer backbone,<br>
b)	adding the oligomerizing hydrophobic monomer(s) to the reaction mass, and<br>
c)	polymerizing the reaction mass at sufficient temperature and for a sufficient time in order to add the oligomerizing hydrophobic monomer(s) to the backbone either as end groups or intermediate groups.<br>
This invention also relates to an aqueous protective coating composition comprising (a) the above mentioned polymer composition, (b) a colorant, and (c) a film forming latex, wherein the viscosity of the aqueous protective coating<br><br>
composition remains unchanged or has an insignificant loss as compared to when using conventional rheology modifiers upon adding the colorant.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A new class of hydrophobically modified water-soluble/water dispersible polymers has been found that provide good thickening, leveling, and sag properties in waterborne coatings that can be used alone without other additives in the coating formulation needed in the past for tailoring the formulation for balancing these properties. It has been found that all that is necessary is to provide synthetic, water soluble polymeric backbone structures with the capacity to be dissolved in water or swellable in water to the degree necessary for the application at hand that has been modified in accordance with the present invention. The new class of rheology modifiers is a hydrophobically modified polymer that has a water-soluble or water swellable backbone portion and oiigomeric hydrophobe portion(s) in the form of blocks of units. The oligomeric hydrophobic block has the following chemical architecture:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where:<br>
n is an integer from 1-100<br>
R is an alkyl or aryl group having from 2 carbons to 100 carbons. The alkyl group may be saturate or unsaturated, cyclic or non cyclic, linear or branched, or halogenated, i.e., fluorinated, chlorinated, or brominated. The alkyl and aryl groups may be, substituted, such as alkylsiloxane, alkylether, arylalkylether, alkylarylene ether, alkylene ether, alkyl thioether, alkylene thioether, alkyl amine, diatkyl amine, dialkyl amine oxide, triakyl ammonium, diaryl amine, dialkyl phosphine, diaryl phosphine, dialkyl phosphine oxide, diaryl phosphine oxide, dialkyl phosphate and the like.<br><br>
A is a connecting diradical of-O-, -S-, -CH2-, -O-CH2-, -S-CH2-,-NH-, -NR'-, -NH-CH2-, -NR-CHr, -PR'-, -POR'- (where R' = 1 to 12 carbons), polyalkylene ether (Mw = 44 to 50000), polyalkylene isocyanate - HEUR (Mw =100 to 50,000).<br>
B is a connecting groups of: -CH2-, -CH20-, CH2S-, -CH2-NH-, -CR"H-O-, -CR"H-S-, -CR"H-NH-, and -CH2NR"- (where R"=1-12 carbons).<br>
C is a connecting end same as A or a terminating end equal to: -OH, SH, -NHR"', -OR"", -SR"', and -H.<br>
Several specific chemical structures are shown below to illustrate this hydrophobe architecture.<br>
Structure 1<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
In this case, A = -OCH2-, B = -O-CH2-, R = -CH2O-CBH18 and C = -OH.<br>
Structure 2<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
In this example, A = -NHCH2-, B = -O-CH2-, R = -CH2O-C8H18 and C = OC6H13. Structure 3<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
In this structure, A = -OCH2-, B = -OCH2-, C = -C6H13 and R = -OCsH5. Structure 4<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
in this structure, A = Polyalkyiene oxide-CH2-, B = -O-CH2-, C = -OH, and R = nonylphenoxy.<br>
Structure 5<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
In this structure, A = -CH2-, B = -CH2-, C = H and R.= Ph. (note, Ph is a phenyl moiety).<br>
Structure 6<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
In this structure, A = -CH2-, B = -CH2-, C = -H, and R = -O-C8H17.<br>
These hydrophobe blocks could be synthesized from corresponding alkyl glycidyl ether (or thio or amido) by heating with a base or a proper nucleophile of choice. Structures 1-4 are products of alkyl glycidyl ethers. Control oligomerization like atom transfer pofymerization, living radical polymerization, cationic polymerization, anionic polymerization and group transfer polymerization with proper quenching reagent would yield desired hydrophobe from reactive vinyl monomers such as styrene, vinyl ether, vinyl ester, acrylate esters, acrylamide ester. Structure 5 and 6 are product examples of control radical oligomerization and proper end-capping.<br>
The hydrophobe blocks may be connected to the water soluble/water dispersible polymer via an ether, ester, urethane, amide, amine, imide, or urea, depending of the choice of one who is skilled in the art. The connection could be<br>
done via a diepoxide, a diisocyanate, a dialkyl halide, diester, or a compound bearing mix reactive groups (for example, epoxyalkylhalide, aikylhalide isocyanate).<br>
The commonly practiced procedure to attach a hydrophobe'to a water soluble/water dispersible polymer bearing reactable hydroxyl groups such as cellulose derivatives is by heating the cellulose alkaline derivative with a hydophobe halide or epoxide. One example of this type of reaction is the synthesis of hydrophobically modified hydroxyethyl cellulose (HMHEC). Both an alkyl halide or an alkyl glycidyl ether can be used as a hydrophobe modifier. Therefore, it is possible to convert the hydrophobe of this invention to an epoxide (using epihalohydrin), or an halogenating reagent like PBr3 or PCI5 to form a reactive hydrophobe.<br>
It is more convenient to incorporate this type of hydrophobe to an addition polymer (vinyl alcohol, acrylamide, acrylates..) via a monomer bearing this hydrophobe. For example, acryloyl ester of this type of hydrophobe from" Structure 4 could be polymerized along with acrylic acid and acrylamide to give the corresponding hydrophobically modified alkaline soluble emulsions (HASE).<br>
It is also convenient to make telechelic polyurethane of hydrophobically modified ethylene oxide urethane block copolymer (HEUR) using a pre-made hydrophobe. The hydrophobe containing one hydroxyl or two hydroxyl groups could be added to a mixture of polyethylene oxide with reactive hydroxyl end group then allowed to react with a diisocyanate.   It is, however, most convenient to make the HEUR backbone and heat the resultant oligomers with an alkyl glycidyl ether of choice. The alkyl glycidyl ether moiety oligomerizes at the end of the HEUR backbone to give the telechelic HEUR.<br>
It is most convenient to just heat a mixture of polyethylene glycol and an alkyl glycidyl ether in the presence of a base in order to make hydrophobically modified PEG. The polymer backbone could be pre-modified with one or several alkyl diols or alkyl triol to form a branched structure, or converted to an acetal-<br><br>
polyether as described in USP 5574127 or USP 6162877. The reaction scheme below illustrates the ease of synthesis of the telecheiic polymer of this type.<br>
Scheme 1<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
The present invention is an associative polymer that has a water-soluble or water-swellable backbone that is a synthetic polymer. This backbone can be derived from a wide selection of materials such as polyacrylamides, polyacrylates, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl sulfonates, polyethylene imine, polydadmac, polyamideazetidinium ion, polyvinylpyroiidone, polyaspartates, polyacetalpolyether, polyalkylethers, and polyalkylthioethers. Most of the water soluble polymer types are described in "Water soluble polymers" by Yale Meltzer (Noyes Data Corporation, Parkridge, New Jersey, USA, 1981). The backbone alone is not reactive and can be any of the synthetic polymers mentioned above as long as the backbone polymer is water soluble or water swellable. The backbone becomes a reactive site when the hydrophobes are internally connected in the backbone or are pendant from the backbone. The hydrophobes can also be terminal groups (also known as telecheiic groups) on<br>
the backbone. The backbone polymer can be linear or branched or dendritic in shape (i.e., a configuration where three branches are attached to a single atom such as a carbon atom), When the hydrophobic oligomeric blocks are alkyl and aryl moieties containing a polymerizable cyclic monomer, the total number of carbon-atoms in the akyl or aryl portions of the hydrophobic oligomeric groups can be from 1 to 100.<br>
The oligomeric hydrophobic blocks of moieties are the reactive sites. The blocks of hydrophobic moieties must have at least two units, preferably at least 3 units, more preferably at least 7 units, and more preferably 10 units. It should be understood that more that 10 units can be present in the hydrophobic moieties and that the number of units are only limited by the feasibility and economics of making such moiety based on the size, structure, steric hindrance, and other chemical or physical forces acting on the closeness of the units attached in the blocks.<br>
In accordance with this invention the oligomeric hydrophobes can be an alkyl or aryl moiety containing a polymerizable cyclic monomer or a polymerizable double bond, or derivatives of these moieties. When the hydrophobe is an alkyl moiety containing a polymerizable cyclic monomer, the alkyl group can have 1 to 40 carbon atoms, preferably 3 to 24 carbons, and more preferably 6 to 18 carbons. When the hydrophobe is an aryl moiety containing a polymerizable cyclic monomer, the aryl group can have 6 to 40 carbon atoms, preferably 6 to 29 carbons, and more preferably 7 to 15 carbons.  Examples of the polymerizable cyclic monomers are alkyl glycidyl ethers, aryl glycidyl ethers, arylalkyl epoxide, alkyl oxazoline, and aryl oxazoline.<br>
When the hydrophobe is a polymerizable double bond, it can be an alkene monomer such as styrene and stryenic compounds, vinyl compounds, acrylates and derivatives thereof, norbornenes and derivatives thereof, and alkenes and derivatives thereof, alkenyl siloxanes and derivatives thereof, alkenyl silanes and derivatives thereof, fluorinated and perfluorinated.alkenes. Examples of alkenes are ethylene, propylene, butylene, etc.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the polymer composition has a weight average molecular weight (Mw) with the upper limit of the polymer being about 10,000,000, preferably about 1,000,000, and more preferably about 100,000. The lower limit of the.weight average molecular weight of the polymer is about 400, preferably about 1,000, and more preferably about 4,000.<br>
One application for this type of hydrophobically modified water-soluble polymer is paint formulation. These paint formulations are latex based, such as acrylic based, vinyl acrylic based or styrene based, it has been found that the telechelic polymers of the present invention provide balance properties in various paint formulations. However, unexpectedly, for acrylic paint (SG10 M), the resultant paint also showed excellent viscosity retention upon (VRT) tinting with various colorants. This type of performance is not seen in the regular hydrophobe polymers alone.<br>
In latex paint formulations, the polymer of the present invention can be used alone or in combination with other conventional prior art rheology modifiers (or thickeners) such as hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC)/ methylcellulose (MC), carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), methylhydroxy ethylcellulose (MHEC), ethylhydroxyethylcellulose (EHEC), and hydrophobically modified hydroxyethylcellulose (HMHEC). The typical latex paint formulations of this invention are acrylic based, vinyl acrylic based, or styrene based. These latex-based paints have pigment volume concentration (PVC) of from 15 to about 80.<br>
