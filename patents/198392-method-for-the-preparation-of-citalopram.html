				<td>Method for the Preparation of Citalopram<br>
The present invention relates to a method for the preparation of the well-known anti¬depressant drug citalopram, l-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-l-(4-fluorophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile.<br>
Background of the Invention<br><br>
It is a selective, centrally acting serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitor, accordingly having antidepressant activities. The antidepressant activity of the compound has been reported in several publications, eg. J. Hyttel Prog. Neuro-Psychopharmacol. &amp; Biol. Psychiat. 1982, 6, 277-295 and A. Gravem, Acta Psychiatr. Scand. 1987, 75, 478-486. The compound has further been disclosed to show effects in the treatment of dementia and cerebrovascular disorders, EP-A 474580.<br>
Citalopram was first disclosed in DE 2,657,013, corresponding to US 4,136,193. This patent publication describes the preparation of citalopram by one method and outlines a further method, which may be used for preparing citalopram.<br>
According to the process described, the corresponding l-(4-fluorophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile is reacted with 3-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl-chloride in the presence of methylsulfinylmethide as condensing ^ent. The starting material was prepared from the corresponding 5-bromo derivative by reaction with cuprous cyanide.<br>
According to the method, which is only outlined in general terms, citalopram may be obtained by ring closure of the compoimd:<br><br><br>
Fxirther processes are disclosed in International patent application Nos. WO 98019511, WO 98019512 and WO 98019513. WO 98019512 and WO 98019513 relate to methods wherein a 5-amino-, 5-carboxy- or 5-(sec: aminocarbonyl)phthalide is subjected to two successive Grignard reactions, ring closure and conversion of the resulting 1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran derivative to the corresponding 5-cyano compoimd, i.e. citalopram. Intemational patent application No. WO 98019511 discloses a process for the manufacture of citalopram wherein a (4-substituted-2-hydroxymethylphenyl-(4-fluorophenyl)methanol compoimd is subjected to ring closure and the resulting 5-substituted l-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran converted to the corresponding 5-cyano derivative which is alkylated with a (3-dimethylamino)propylhalogenide in order to obtain citalopram.<br><br>
Finally, methods for preparing the individual enantiomers of citalopram are disclosed in US Patent No 4,943,590 from which it also appears that the ring closure of the intermediate of Formula III may be carried out via a labile ester with a base.<br>
It has now, surprisingly, been found that citalopram may be manufactured by a novel favourable and safe procedure using convenient starting materials.<br><br><br>
Furthermore, according to the invention, the compounds of Formula IV may be prepared by different methods.<br><br><br><br>
The resulting compound of Formula VII is reacted with a reducing agent such as LiAlH^, Red-Al, AIH3 or activated forms of NaBH4, e.g. NaBH4, Me2S04; NaBH4, l^, NaBH^, BF3. EtjO; or BjH^; followed by treatment with acid or another dehydrating agent to perform ring closure to form the compound of Formula VIII.<br>
The alcohol of Formula VIII is conveniently activated by tosylchloride or mesylchloride to form the corresponding substituted sulphonate; or the alcohol is converted into the corresponding benzyUc halide. This conversion is preferably carried out with SOBrj or SOCI2.<br>
The corresponding sulphonate or halide is either converted directly to the compound of<br>
Formula FV by reaction with liquid ammonia;<br>
or by a reaction with a metal salt of phthalimide, preferably potassium phthalamide<br>
followed by treatment with NHjNHj or ^y treatment with an amine in an alcohol, i.e.<br>
R"NHj/R"-OH, wherein R^ and R® are lower alkyl, preferably methyl or ethyl, e.g.<br>
methylamine in ethanol;<br>
or by a reaction with metal azide, MN3, M preferably being Na or K; followed by treatment<br>
with a reducing agent such as Pd/C and H2 or a hydrate source such as LiAlH4 or NaBH4 or<br>
an activated form of it.<br>
Another method for preparing the compound of Formula IV includes the follovmg steps:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The alcohol of Formula XV is conveniently activated by tosylchloride or mesylchloride to fonn the corresponding substituted sulphonate; or the alcohol is converted into the corresponding benzylic halide. This conversion is preferably carried out with SOBrj or SOCl,.<br>
The corresponding sulphonate or halide is either converted directly to the compound of<br>
Formula XVII by reaction with hquid ammonia;<br>
or by a reaction with a metal salt of phthalimide, preferably potassium phthalamide,<br>
followed by treatment with NH2NH2 or by treatment with an amine in an alcohol, i.e.<br>
R^"NHz/R"-OH, wherein R* and R" are lower alkyl, preferably methyl or ethyl, e.g.<br>
methylamine in ethanol;<br>
or by a reaction with metal azide MN3, M preferably being Na or K; followed by treatment<br>
with a reducing agent such as Pd/C and H2 or a hydride source such as LiAlH4 or NaBH4 or<br>
an activated form thereof<br>
The resulting compound of Formula XVII is alkylated with<br><br>
wherein X is a leaving group in the presence of a suitable base. X is preferably halogen or sulphonate.<br>
Optionally, the alkylating reaction is a stepwise alkylation analogous to the stepwise aUcylation described above.<br>
Optionally the steps of the alkylation and the conversion to the cyano derivative are in opposite order so the conversion to the cyano derivative is performed before the alkylation.<br>
Throughout the specification and claims; the terms lower aUcyl or Cj^ alkyl refer to a branched or unbranched alkyl grouphaving from one to six carbon atoms inclusive, such as methyl, ethyl, 1-propyl, 2-propyl, 1-butyl, 2-butyl, 2-methyl-2-propyl, 2,2-dimethyl-l-ethyl and 2-methyl-l-propyl.<br>
Similarly, alkenyl and alkynyl, respectively, designate such groups having from two to six carbon atoms, including one double bond and triple bond respectively, such as ethenyl, propenyl, butenyl, ethynyl, propynyl, and butynyl.<br>
The term aryl refers to a mono- or bicyclic carbocyclic aromatic group, such as phenyl and naphthyl, in particular phenyl.<br>
The term aralkyl refers to aryl-alkyl, wherein aryl and alkyl are as defined above.<br>
.ialogen means chloro, bromo or iodo.<br>
The compoimd of general Fomiula I may be used as the free base or as a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof. As acid addition salts, such salts formed with organic or inorganic acids may be used. Exemplary of such organic salts are those with maleic, ftimaric, benzoic, ascorbic, succinic, oxalic, bismethylenesalicylic, methanesulfonic, ethanedisulfonic, acetic, propionic, tartaric, salicylic, citric, gluconic, lactic, malic, mandelic, cinnamic, citraconic, aspartic, stearic, palmitic, itaconic, glycohc, p-aminobenzoic, glutamic, benzene sulfonic and theophylline acetic acids, as well as the 8-halotheophyllines, for example 8-bromotheophylline. Exemplary of such inorganic salts are those with hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric and nitric acids.<br>
The acid addition salts of the compounds may be prepared by methods known in the art. The base is reacted with either the calculated amount of acid in a water miscible solvent, such as acetone or ethanol, with subsequent isolation of the salt by concentration and<br><br>
cooung, or with an excess of flie acid in a water immiscible solvent, such as ethylether, ethylacetate or dichloromethane, with the salt separating spontaneously.<br>
The phamiaceutical compositions of the invention may be administered in any suitable way and in any suitable form, for example orally in the form of tablets, capsules, powders or syrups, or parenterally in the form of usual sterile solutions for injection.<br>
The pharmaceutical formulations of the invention may be prepared by conventional methods in the art. For example, tablets may be prepared by mixing the active ingredient with ordinary adjuvants and/or diluents and subsequently compressing the mixture in a conventional tabletting machine. Examples of adjuvants or diluents comprise: Com starch, potato starch, talcum, magnesium stearate, gelatine, lactose, gums, and the like.
