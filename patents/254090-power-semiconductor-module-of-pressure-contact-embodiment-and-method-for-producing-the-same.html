PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br>
ENGLISH TRANSLATION VERIFICATION<br>
CERTIFICATE u/r. 20(3)(b)<br>
I, Mr. HIRAL CHANDRAKANT JOSHI, an authorized agent for the applicant, SEMIKRON ELEKTRONIK GMBH &amp; CO. KG, GERMANY do hereby verify that the content of English translation of certified German Priority claiming 10 2007 016 222.9 thereof is correct and complete.<br><br><br>
Power semiconductor modules of this type are known in various embodiments. By way of example, DE103 16 356 Al describes a power semiconductor module of this type which comprises a number of partial modules each having a base plate and also a frame-like housing and connection elements for load and auxiliary connections. The individual partial modules are assembled to form the power semiconductor module by means of a common cover and/or by means of connections that fix the individual partial modules.<br>
A power semiconductor module comprising at least one substrate on which power semiconductor components are situated is for example also known from DE 101 49 886 Al. This known power semiconductor module additionally comprises a press-on device which acts on the at least one substrate and which serves to press the/each substrate in the mounted state onto a heat sink in order to dissipate the heat loss of the power semiconductor components to the heat sink. In this known power semiconductor module, the press-on device is formed by a module housing with at least one spring-elastic region.<br>
The invention is based on the object of providing a power semiconductor module of pressure contact embodiment, for arrangement on a cooling component, which can be produced cost-effectively in a simply constructed manner, and of specifying a method for producing the power semiconductor module.<br>
This object is achieved substantively by means of the futures of Claim 1, i.e. by means of a power semiconductor module of pressure contact embodiment, for arrangement on a cooling component comprising at least one substrate having conductor tracks and power semiconductor components on its main area remote from the cooling component,<br>
comprising a mounting basic body, on the underside of which the at least one substrate is arranged in a positioned manner and which is formed with cutouts which are provided for leading through contact feet which make pressure contact<br><br><br>
with the conductor tracks of the at least one substrate and which project away from strip sections insulated from one another, with which load connection elements are formed which are arranged in a positioned manner on the mounting basic body,<br>
comprising a dimensionally stable stiff cover, which covers the mounting basic body on all sides in a positioned manner and is connected to the mounting basic body by means of snap-action latching connections and which is designed for fixing the power semiconductor module to the cooling component by means of fixing holes, and<br>
comprising at least one elastic pad element which is assigned to the/each substrate and which is restrained between the cover and the strip sections of the load connection elements.<br>
In this case, it has proved to be advantageous if the mounting basic body has an associated peripheral frame web at its underside for the precise positioning of the at least one substrate. The/each peripheral frame web has clear internal dimensions matched to the external edge dimensions of the associated substrate.<br>
It is advantageous if the mounting basic body has on its underside the cutouts for shaft elevations enclosing the contact feet. Said shaft elevations advantageously form guides for the contact feet of the load connections, which guides optimize the positioning of the contact feet in relation to the conductor tracks of the at least one substrate.<br>
According to the invention, the mounting basic body is preferably formed on the top side with a peripheral frame edge, from which resilient latching fingers project away, and the cover is preferably formed with latching holes for the latching fingers. The latching fingers of the mounting basic body and the latching holes of the cover form the snap-action latching connections between the mounting basic body and the cover.<br><br><br>
In the power semiconductor module according to the invention it has proved to be advantageous if the mounting basic body is formed on the top side with pedestals for the load connection elements and the cover is formed with shafts matched to the pedestals. Such an embodiment affords the advantage that the cover can be arranged simply and in time-saving fashion in a precisely positioned manner on the mounting basic body equipped with the load connection elements - and with auxiliary connection elements. Before the cover is connected to the mounting basic body, however, the at least one pad element is arranged on the strip sections of the load connection elements.<br>
Preferably, threaded sleeves are integrated into the pedestals of the mounting basic body, said threaded sleeves being axially aligned with through holes formed in connection contacts of the load connection elements. Said connection contacts are externally accessible through the shafts which are formed in the cover and are matched to the pedestals, such that in the assembled state of the power semiconductor module according to the invention - after said module has been fixed to a cooling component - it is possible to connect, i.e. fixedly screw - connection cables or the like to the connection contacts.<br>
The cover can have an additional fixing shaft with a fixing hole for fixing the power semiconductor module to the cooling component between two shafts.<br>
The cover of the power semiconductor module according to the invention is advantageously a cover which is injection-moulded from a suitable plastic material and which is preferably formed with stiffening ribs in order to obtain the desired stiffness and dimensional stability on its top side. In this case, the stiffening ribs are preferably configured in such a way that the cover is formed with receiving compartments for capacitors on its top side.<br>
In the power semiconductor module according to the invention it is preferred if the at least one substrate is pressure-contact-connected, by means of resilient auxiliary<br><br><br>
connection elements positioned on the mounting basic body to a circuit board which is fitted to the cover and from which auxiliary contacts project away. In this case, it is preferred if the cover is formed with auxiliary shafts for the auxiliary contacts. In such an embodiment it is likewise preferred if the mounting basic body is formed with auxiliary pedestals for the auxiliary shafts into which threaded sleeves are integrated which are axially aligned with holes formed in the auxiliary connection elements.<br>
The object on which the invention is based is achieved according to the method by virtue of the fact that firstly the load connection elements insulated from one another are arranged on the mounting basic body, wherein the contact feet of the load connection elements are plugged through the cutouts formed in the mounting basic body such that the contact feet project from the mounting basic body on the underside, afterwards the at least one pad element is arranged on the strip sections of the load connection elements, resilient auxiliary connection elements are positioned beforehand or afterwards on the mounting basic body, afterwards the cover is fitted to the mounting basic body and connected to the mounting basic body by means of the snap-action latching connections, and, finally, the at least one substrate coated with an insulant layer is fixed to the underside of the mounting basic body by means of the insulant layer. Said insulant layer is a silicone gel, for example, which is applied to the at least one substrate by means of a known coating method. This results in effective internal insulation of the power semiconductor module.<br>
The power semiconductor module assembled in this way can then be fixed on an associated heat sink. This fixing brings about the pressure-contact-connection of the load and auxiliary connections to the at least one substrate.<br>
Further details, features and advantages will become apparent from the following description of an exemplary embodiment of the power semiconductor module according to the invention that is illustrated in the drawing.<br><br><br>
The figure shows a three-dimensional exploded illustration of an embodiment of the power semiconductor module 10 of pressure contact embodiment. The power semiconductor module 10 has two substrates 12. Each substrate 12 has a large area metallization on its underside 14 in order to bring about optimum heat dissipation to a cooling component (not illustrated) on which the power semiconductor module 10 is arranged. On the top side 16, the respective substrate 12 is provided with conductor tracks 18 and with power semiconductor components 20 which are contact-connected to the conductor tracks 18 for example by means of bonding wires (not depicted).<br>
The power semiconductor module 10 has a mounting basic body 22 on the underside 24 of which the two substrates 12 are arranged in a precisely positioned manner. The mounting basic body 22 is formed with cutouts 26 provided for leading through contact feet 28 which make pressure contact with the conductor tracks 18 of the substrates 12. The contact feet 28 project away from strip sections 30 which are electrically insulated from one another by means of insulant interlayers 32. The strip sections 30 with the contact feet 28 form together with respectively associated connection contacts 34, of which only one connection contact 34 is visible in the figure of the drawing while only the connecting sections 36 of the other two connection contacts 34 are visible, the load connection elements 38 of the power semiconductor module 10.<br>
The connecting sections 36 of the load connection elements 38 are fixedly connected to the associated strip sections 30 by means of rivets 40.<br>
Pad elements 42 are arranged on the strip sections 30 of the load connection elements 38, said pad elements being formed with cutouts 44 corresponding to the connecting sections 36 and holes 46 corresponding to the rivets 40.<br>
The power semiconductor module 10 has a cover 48, which covers the mounting basic body 22, equipped with the load connection elements 38, on all sides in a<br><br><br>
precisely positioned manner and which is connected to the mounting basic body 22 by means of snap-action latching connections 50.<br>
At its four corners, the cover 48 is formed with fixing holes 52 which serve for fixing, i.e. fixedly screwing, the power semiconductor module 10 to a cooling component (not depicted).<br>
For precisely positioning the two substrates 12 on the underside 24 of the mounting basic body 22, the latter is formed on its underside 24 with two self-contained peripheral frame webs 54. The mounting body 22 has on the top side a peripheral frame edge 56, from which resilient latching fingers 58 project away. The cover 48 is formed with latching holes 60 which together with the latching fingers 58 form the snap-action latching connections 50.<br>
Pedestals 62 project material-integrally away from the top side of the mounting basic body 22, said pedestals being provided for the centring and precise positioning of the load connection elements 38 and additionally for the centred positioning of the cover 48. For this purpose, the cover 48 is formed with shafts 64 matched to the pedestals 62.<br>
Threaded sleeves 66 are integrated into the pedestals 62. The threaded sleeves 66 are aligned with through holes 68 formed in the connection contacts 34 of the load connection elements 38.<br>
A fixing shaft 70 having a fixing hole (not illustrated) is formed in the cover 48 between two shafts 64, i.e. between the right-hand and the middle shaft 64 in the drawing. An additional fixing of the power semiconductor module 10 to the cooling component (not illustrated) is thereby possible.<br><br><br>
The cover 48 is formed with stiffening ribs 72 on its top side. The stiffening ribs 72 are configured in such a way that the cover 48 has receiving compartments 74 for capacitors (not illustrated) on its top side.<br>
The substrates 12 are pressure-contact-connected, by means of resilient auxiliary connection elements 76 positioned on the mounting basic body 22, to a circuit board 78 which is fixed to the cover 48 on the inside and from which auxiliary contacts 80 project away. The cover 48 is formed with auxiliary shafts 82 provided for the auxiliary contacts 80. The mounting basic body 22 is formed with auxiliary pedestals 84 which are matched to the auxiliary shafts 82 and into which are integrated threaded sleeves 86 which are axially aligned with holes - not visible in the figure of the drawing - in the auxiliary connection elements 80 in the assembled state of the power semiconductor module 10.<br><br><br>
