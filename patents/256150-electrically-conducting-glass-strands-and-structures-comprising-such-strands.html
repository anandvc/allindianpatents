ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTING GLASS STRANDS AND STRUCTURES<br>
COMPRISING SUCH STRANDS<br>
The present invention relates to glass strands<br>
comprising an electrically conducting coating.<br>
It also relates to the electrically conducting<br>
coating composition used to coat the said strands, to<br>
the process for the manufacture of these strands, to<br>
the reinforcing structures formed from these strands<br>
and to the composite materials including these strands.<br>
Reinforcing glass strands are conventionally<br>
prepared by mechanically drawing molten glass streams<br>
flowing by gravity from the multiple orifices of<br>
bushings filled with molten glass, to form filaments<br>
which are gathered together into base strands, which<br>
strands are then collected.<br>
During the drawing, and before they are<br>
gathered together into strands, the glass filaments are<br>
coated with a sizing composition, generally an aqueous<br>
sizing composition, by passing over a sizing member.<br>
The role of the size is essential in two<br>
respects.<br>
During the manufacture of the strands, it<br>
protects the filaments from the abrasion resulting from<br>
the rubbing of the latter at high speed over the<br>
members of the process, acting as a lubricant. It also<br>
makes it possible to remove the electrostatic charges<br>
generating during this rubbing. Finally, it gives<br>
cohesion to the strand by providing bonding of the<br>
filaments to one another.<br>
During the use for the purpose of producing<br>
composite materials, the size improves the wetting of<br>
the glass and the impregnation of the strand by the<br>
matrix to be reinforced and it promotes the adhesion<br>
between the glass and the said matrix, thus resulting<br>
in composite materials with improved mechanical<br>
properties.<br>
The glass strands in their various forms<br>
(continuous, chopped or milled strands, mats, grids,<br><br>
fabrics, and the like) are commonly used to effectively<br>
reinforce matrices of varied natures, for example<br>
thermoplastic or thermosetting materials and cement.<br>
Generally, the glass strands are rendered<br>
conducting by the application of a coating based on<br>
particles capable of conducting the electrical current.<br>
The coating is obtained by depositing, on the strands<br>
coated with the size, the conducting particles in<br>
dispersion or in suspension in an aqueous medium and by<br>
removing the water by heating at an appropriate<br>
temperature.<br>
The compositions known for the preparation of<br>
the abovementioned coating use, as conducting<br>
particles, graphite, carbon black or organometallic<br>
compounds capable of decomposing to give metals under<br>
the action of heat, if appropriate by introducing a<br>
carbon-comprising compound capable of giving carbon by<br>
thermal decomposition into the composition<br>
(US-A-3 269 883) or into the size (US-A-3 247 020).<br>
In US-A-4 090 984, use is made of a semi-<br>
conducting coating composition comprising at least one<br>
polyacrylate emulsion, one carbon black dispersion and<br>
one thixotropic gelling agent. The carbon black<br>
dispersion represents 20 to 40 parts per 100 parts of<br>
the composition. In example 1, the content of carbon<br>
black is equal to 11.9% by weight of the solid matter<br>
present in the composition.<br>
In US-A-4 209 425, the coating composition<br>
comprises conducting particles, in particular made of<br>
graphite or of carbon, at least one surfactant, one<br>
thixotrophic gelling agent and optionally one<br>
organosilane coupling agent and/or one antifoaming<br>
agent. The content of conducting particles in the<br>
composition is between 5 and 15% by weight of solid<br>
matter of the composition.<br>
With the compositions which have just been<br>
mentioned, the content of conducting particles in the<br>
final coating remains low, resulting for this reason in<br>
a low level of electrical conductivity.<br><br>
Recent times have seen the appearance of novel<br>
materials incorporating glass strands which exhibit<br>
high electrical conductivity properties and which can<br>
for this reason be heated by the Joule effect. These<br>
materials include in particular composite materials<br>
with an organic matrix, of the thermoplastic or<br>
thermosetting polymer type, or cement matrix, in which<br>
materials the abovementioned strands also play a<br>
reinforcing role.<br>
The improvement in the electrical conductivity<br>
must not be made at the expense of the other<br>
properties. As regards the composite materials, it must<br>
in particular be kept in mind that the strands are<br>
above all intended to reinforce matrices and<br>
consequently they must exhibit all the qualities for<br>
this.<br>
In particular, the conducting coating must:<br>
-	provide bonding of the filaments to one<br>
another and also bond the strands so as to<br>
obtain acceptable or improved mechanical<br>
properties when composite materials are<br>
concerned,<br>
-	protect the glass strands from the mechanical<br>
assaults which occur when the reinforcing<br>
structures are employed on building sites,<br>
-	protect the glass strands from chemical<br>
corrosion and from assaults related to the<br>
environment, so as to provide satisfactory<br>
durability, and<br>
-	provide good bonding with the polymer matrix<br>
to be reinforced, that is to say render the<br>
strands and the matrix compatible.<br>
A subject-matter of the present invention is<br>
glass strands and structures incorporating glass<br>
strands provided with a coating which exhibits a high<br>
electrical conductivity and which are in addition<br>
capable of meeting the requirements related to<br>
reinforcement which are mentioned above.<br>
Another subject-matter of the invention is the<br><br>
electrically conducting aqueous coating composition<br>
used to coat the abovementioned glass strands and<br>
structures.<br>
Another subject-matter of the invention is a<br>
process for the manufacture of the glass strands and<br>
glass strand structures capable of conducting the<br>
electrical current.<br>
A further subject-matter of the invention is<br>
the composite materials comprising a matrix reinforced<br>
by the abovementioned strands or structures capable of<br>
conducting electricity.<br>
The glass strands and the glass strand<br>
structures in accordance with the invention are coated<br>
with an electrically conducting coating composition<br>
which comprises (as % by weight of solid matter):<br>
-	6 to 50% of a film-forming agent, preferably<br>
6 to 45%,<br>
-	5 to 40% of at least one compound chosen from<br>
plasticizing agents, surface-active agents<br>
and/or dispersing agents,<br>
-	20 to 75% of electrically conducting<br>
particles,<br>
-	0 to 10% of a doping agent,<br>
-	0 to 10% of a thickening agent,<br>
-	0 to 15% of additives.<br>
In the context of the invention, the term<br>
"glass strands" is understood to mean both the base<br>
strands obtained by gathering together, without<br>
twisting, a multitude of filaments under the bushing,<br>
and the assemblages of these strands, in particular in<br>
the form of rovings, and the strands which have been<br>
subjected to a twisting operation, and the assemblages<br>
of these strands. In the glass strands in accordance<br>
with the invention, the filaments are coated with a<br>
sizing composition compatible in particular with the<br>
film-forming agent of the conducting coating. The<br>
electrically conducting coating will thus be<br>
superimposed on the size already present on the strand,<br>
which means that the application of this coating can be<br><br>
likened to a coating operation.<br>
Sill in the same context, the term "strand<br>
structures" is understood to mean structures obtained<br>
by gathering together intertwined strands, for example<br>
fabrics, or nonintertwined strands, for example<br>
nonwovens, in the form of a mat or veil of continuous<br>
strands, and grids.<br>
The film-forming agent in accordance with the<br>
invention plays several roles: it confers mechanical<br>
cohesion on the coating by causing the conducting<br>
particles to adhere to the glass strand and by<br>
providing bonding of these particles to one another, if<br>
appropriate with the material to be reinforced; it<br>
contributes to bonding the filaments to one another;<br>
finally, it protects the strands against mechanical<br>
damage and chemical and environmental assaults.<br>
The film-forming agent is generally a polymer,<br>
preferably with an elastomeric nature, so as to give<br>
flexibility to the strands. Flexible strands prove to<br>
be particularly advantageous in the production of<br>
structures which can be collected in the form of a<br>
wound package and which are highly "conformable", that<br>
is to say which are capable of matching virtually<br>
perfectly the most diverse shapes.<br>
The film-forming agent can, for example, be<br>
chosen from polyvinylpyrrolidones, poly(vinyl<br>
alcohoDs, polyacrylics (homopolymers or copolymers),<br>
styrene polymers, for example of the styrene-butadiene<br>
(SBR) type, poly(vinyl chloride)s (in particular in the<br>
latex or plastisol form), polyurethanes and the blends<br>
of these polymers. Generally, thermoplastic polyolefins<br>
are avoided as a result of their electrically<br>
insulating nature and their high creep capability.<br>
The choice of the polymer also depends on the<br>
nature of the matrix to be reinforced. As regards<br>
cementing materials, polyacrylics, styrene polymers and<br>
poly(vinyl chloride)s are preferred.<br>
When the content of film-forming agent is less<br>
than 6% by weight of solid materials, the cohesion of<br><br>
the coating is inadequate. Above 50%, in particular<br>
45%, the amount of conducting particles to be intro-<br>
duced is too low to achieve a satisfactory level of<br>
electrical conductivity. Preferably, the amount of<br>
film-forming agent in the coating represents 10 to 35%<br>
by weight of the solid matter and better still 15 to<br>
35%.<br>
The plasticizing agent makes it possible to<br>
lower the glass transition temperature of the film-<br>
forming agent to a value of the order of 2 0°C, which<br>
makes the coating more flexible, and also makes it<br>
possible to limit the shrinkage after the heat<br>
treatment. The polymers obtained by copolymerization of<br>
butadiene and of an acrylic monomer are preferred.<br>
The amount of plasticizing agent in the coating<br>
generally represents 0 to 15% by weight of the solid<br>
matter, preferably 0 to 10% and better still 3 to 10%.<br>
The surface-active agents improve the suspen-<br>
sion and the dispersion of the conducting particles and<br>
promote compatibility between the other constituents<br>
and the water. It is preferable to use cationic or<br>
nonionic surfactants, in order to avoid problems of<br>
stability of the coating composition and of<br>
nonhomogeneous dispersion of the particles.<br>
The amount of surface-active agent in the<br>
coating generally represents less than 10% by weight of<br>
the solid matter, preferably 0.5 to 10%.<br>
The dispersing agents help in dispersing the<br>
conducting particles in the water and reduce their<br>
separation on settling.<br>
The amount of dispersing agent in the coating<br>
generally represents 2 to 20% by weight of the solid<br>
matter, preferably 3 to 10%.<br>
The plasticizing, surface-active and dispersing<br>
agents can have one or more of the functions specific<br>
to each of the categories mentioned above. The choice<br>
of these agents and of the amount to be used depends on<br>
the film-forming agents and on the conducting<br>
particles.<br><br>
These agents can in particular be chosen from:<br>
	organic compounds, in particular<br>
-	optionally halogenated, aliphatic or<br>
aromatic, polyalkoxylated compounds, such as<br>
ethoxylated/propoxylated alkylphenols, pre-<br>
ferably including 1 to 3 0 ethylene oxide<br>
groups and 0 to 15 propylene oxide groups,<br>
ethoxylated/propoxylated bisphenols, prefer-<br>
ably including 1 to 4 0 ethylene oxide groups<br>
and 0 to 2 0 propylene oxide groups, or<br>
ethoxylated/propoxylated fatty alcohols, the<br>
alkyl chain of which preferably comprises 8<br>
to 20 carbon atoms and including 2 to<br>
50 ethylene oxide groups and up to 20<br>
propylene oxide groups. These polyalkoxylated<br>
compounds can be block or random copolymers,<br>
-	polyalkoxylated fatty acid esters, for<br>
example polyethylene glycol fatty acid<br>
esters, the alkyl chain of which preferably<br>
comprises 8 to 2 0 carbon atoms including 2 to<br>
50 ethylene oxide groups and up to 2 0<br>
propylene oxide groups,<br>
-	amino compounds, for example amines, which<br>
are optionally alkoxylated, amine oxides or<br>
alkylamides, sodium, potassium or ammonium<br>
succinates and taurates, sugar derivatives,<br>
in particular sorbitan derivatives, sodium,<br>
potassium or ammonium alkyl sulphates and<br>
alkyl phosphates, and polyether phosphates,<br>
	inorganic compounds, for example silica<br>
derivatives, it being possible for these compounds to<br>
be used alone or as a blend with the abovementioned<br>
organic compounds.<br>
If the total amount of plasticizing, surface-<br>
active and dispersing agents is less than 5%, poor<br>
dispersion of the conducting particles (presence of<br>
aggregates) and/or phase separation is/are observed.<br>
When the content exceeds 40%, a serious decline in the<br>
mechanical performance occurs.<br><br>
The electrically conducting particles make it<br>
possible to confer electrical conductivity on the glass<br>
strands. In accordance with the invention, these are<br>
carbon-based particles, in particular graphite and/or<br>
carbon black particles.<br>
Whether the graphite is natural or synthetic in<br>
origin has no effect on the electrical conductivity. It<br>
is thus possible to use without distinction either type<br>
of graphite, alone or as a mixture.<br>
The particles can have any shape, for example<br>
the shape of a sphere, flake or needle. Nevertheless,<br>
it has been found that the electrical conductivity of a<br>
mixture of particles of different shapes is improved<br>
with respect to the same amount of particles of<br>
identical shape. Preferably, 30 to 60% of the<br>
conducting particles have a high aspect ratio (defined<br>
by the ratio of the greatest dimension to the smallest<br>
dimension) preferably varying from 5 to 20, in<br>
particular of the order of 10, and advantageously at<br>
least 15% of the particles are provided in the flake or<br>
needle shape.<br>
As well as the shape, the size of the particles<br>
is an important parameter from the viewpoint of the<br>
electrical conductivity. As a general rule, the size of<br>
the particles, taken in their greatest dimension, does<br>
not exceed 250 µm, preferably 100 µm.<br>
Advantageously, the abovementioned particles,<br>
generally made of graphite, are combined with an<br>
electrically conducting carbon black powder with a<br>
particle size of less than or equal to 1 µm, preferably<br>
exhibiting a mean size of between 50 and 100 nm. The<br>
carbon black particles, as a result of their small<br>
size, make it possible to create contact points between<br>
the graphite particles, which makes it possible to<br>
further improve the electrical conductivity.<br>
Preferably, the conducting coating composition<br>
comprises (as % by weight of solid matter):<br>
- 2.5 to 45% and better still 15 to 40% of<br>
graphite particles having a size of between<br><br>
10 and 100 µm, at least 5% by weight of these<br>
particles being provided in the form of<br>
flakes or needles with an aspect ratio of<br>
greater than or equal to 5,<br>
-	0 to 45%, preferably 5 to 25%, of graphite<br>
particles with a size of less than 10 µm,<br>
preferably having a mean size of the order of<br>
4 µm,<br>
-	2.5 to 45%, preferably 15 to 40%, of carbon<br>
black particles having a size of less than<br>
1 µm.<br>
As already indicated, the amount of conducting<br>
particles represents 20 to 75% of the weight of the<br>
solid matter of the coating. If the content is less<br>
than 20%, there is no electrical conduction as the<br>
percolation threshold is not reached. When the content<br>
exceeds 75%, a portion of the particles no longer<br>
adheres to the glass strand.<br>
The doping agent makes it possible to increase<br>
the conductivity by contributing free electrons or by<br>
promoting delocalization of the electrons.<br>
The doping agent is chosen from organic salts,<br>
such as ammonium crotonate, lithium dodecyl sulphate<br>
and copper acetylacetonate, or inorganic salts, such as<br>
ammonium polyphosphate, titanium chloride or zinc<br>
chloride. Preferably, ammonium crotonate is used.<br>
The doping agent advantageously represents less<br>
than 5% of the weight of solid matter of the coating.<br>
Nevertheless, owing to the fact that the increase in<br>
conductivity remains low with respect to the amount<br>
introduced and that problems of resistance to ageing<br>
may occur, it is preferable to limit the content of<br>
doping agent to 1%. In the majority of cases, no doping<br>
agent is added.<br>
The thickening agent makes it possible to<br>
adjust the viscosity of the coating composition to the<br>
conditions of application to the strand by stabilizing<br>
the dispersion of the particles so as to prevent them<br>
from settling on standing, thus making possible the<br><br>
deposition of the desired amount on the strand.<br>
The thickening agent is chosen from strongly<br>
hydrophilic compounds, such as carboxymethylcelluloses,<br>
gums, for example guar or xanthan gums, alginates,<br>
polyacrylics, polyamides and the blends of these<br>
compounds.<br>
The amount of thickening agent, when it is<br>
used, varies according to the nature of the compound<br>
(the grade, in the case of the carboxymethyl-<br>
celluloses) .<br>
Preferably, the content of thickening agent is<br>
less than 10% by weight of the solid matter of the<br>
coating.<br>
The conducting coating can also comprise the<br>
usual additives for glass strands, in particular<br>
adhesion promoters, which make it possible to improve<br>
the coupling between the glass and the material to be<br>
reinforced, such as silanes, lubricating and/or<br>
antifoaming agents, such as mineral oils, fatty esters,<br>
for example isopropyl palmitate and butyl stearate, or<br>
organic polymers, or complexing agents, such as<br>
derivatives of EDTA or of gallic acid.<br>
Preferably, the total amount of additives is<br>
less than 10% by weight of the solid matter of the<br>
coating.<br>
The conducting coating composition capable of<br>
coating the glass strands in accordance with the<br>
invention comprises abovementioned constituents and<br>
water.<br>
The content of water in the coating composition<br>
depends on the conditions of application, in particular<br>
on the viscosity and on the content of conducting<br>
particles to be deposited. As a general rule, the<br>
amount of water is determined so as to obtain a<br>
viscosity of greater than or equal to 190 mPa•s,<br>
preferably of less than 40 000 mPa-s, advantageously of<br>
less than 20 000 mPa•s, better still of less than<br>
10 000 mPa•s, in particular of less than or equal to<br>
5400 mPa•s.<br><br>
The composition is prepared conventionally by-<br>
introducing the various constituents in the aqueous<br>
medium, preferably individually, with sufficient<br>
stirring to keep the conducting particles in dispersion<br>
or in suspension.<br>
When a thickening agent is used, it is<br>
introduced first in the form of an aqueous solution,<br>
preferably heated to approximately 80°C in order to<br>
dissolve better.<br>
Generally, the coating composition is used<br>
virtually immediately after having been prepared but it<br>
can also be used after a storage period of approxi-<br>
mately six months at a temperature of 20 to 25°C. If<br>
appropriate, vigorous stirring makes it possible to<br>
redisperse the particles which have separated by<br>
settling, without this affecting the qualities of the<br>
composition.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the process<br>
for the manufacture of the glass strands and of the<br>
strand structures coated with the electrically<br>
conducting coating comprises the stages consisting in:<br>
coating glass strands or glass strand<br>
structures with the abovementioned conduct-<br>
ing coating composition, and<br>
heating the said strands or the said<br>
structures, thus coated, at a temperature<br>
sufficient to remove the water and to<br>
strengthen the conducting coating.<br>
The composition is applied to glass strands at<br>
various stages of the process after fiberizing,<br>
preferably to strands originating from wound packages,<br>
for example rovings, or to structures in which the<br>
strands are gathered together in various ways: by<br>
superimposition of continuous strands deposited in a<br>
random manner (mat or veil) or ordered manner (grid) or<br>
by weaving with intertwining of the strands.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the<br>
coating of the strand or of the strand structure is<br>
carried out by immersion in a bath of the conducting<br><br>
coating composition. In the bath, the strand or the<br>
structure passes into a device which makes it possible<br>
to control the amount of coating composition to be<br>
deposited.<br>
In the case of strands, the device can be a<br>
bushing positioned in the bath, preferably a conical<br>
bushing, the angle of the cone of which is defined so<br>
that the strand entering via the biggest opening can be<br>
coated by the composition in a uniform way over the<br>
whole of its surface.<br>
As regards strand structures, the device can be<br>
a padding machine, of the type used in the textile<br>
industry, positioned at the outlet of the bath.<br>
Optionally, before passing through the bushing<br>
or over the padding machine, the strand or the<br>
structure can pass over a device targeted at "opening"<br>
the strands and making possible better impregnation of<br>
the filaments. This device can be composed of one or<br>
more series of bars forming turn rolls, in the case of<br>
the treatment of the strand, or of a series of rollers,<br>
for the treatment of strand structures.<br>
At the outlet of the bath, the strand or the<br>
structure is treated thermally to remove the water and<br>
to strengthen the coating. As a general rule, the<br>
treatment temperature is greater than approximately<br>
105°C and less than approximately 220°C, preferably<br>
less than 160°C. To prevent blistering of the coating<br>
brought about by rapid removal of the water, it is<br>
preferable to heat the strand or the structure at a<br>
temperature close to the minimum temperature indicated,<br>
if need be while increasing the duration of treatment,<br>
or to carry out the treatment continuously over the<br>
complete temperature range in successive stationary<br>
phases or with a temperature gradient. Preferably, the<br>
maximum temperature remains less than approximately<br>
150°C, and better still less than 130°C.<br>
Any appropriate heating device can be used for<br>
this, for example an infrared oven or a device which<br>
makes it possible to heat the strand or the structure<br><br>
by contact, for example a device composed of one or<br>
more rotary heating drums.<br>
The temperature and the duration of the<br>
treatment are chosen according to the type of device<br>
used so as to obtain a strengthened coating. By way of<br>
indication, the treatment in an oven can be carried out<br>
satisfactorily at a temperature of the order of 105°C<br>
for a time which generally does not exceed 3 hours.<br>
After the heat treatment, the glass strand is<br>
collected, for example in the form of wound packages,<br>
or else it is deposited on a translationally moving<br>
receiving support to form a mat.<br>
The glass strand and the strand structure in<br>
accordance with the invention are characterized in that<br>
they have electrical conduction properties while having<br>
the qualities specific to providing a reinforcing<br>
function. The strand and the structure are noteworthy<br>
in that the amount of conducting coating can represent<br>
up to 200% of their total weight, more generally of the<br>
order of 20 to 60%, and that this relatively high<br>
content of conducting particles confers thereon an<br>
altogether advantageous level of performance. An<br>
assessment of this level is given by the value of the<br>
volume electrical resistivity (equal to the inverse of<br>
the volume electrical conductivity), which is a<br>
standard reference term in the field of conducting<br>
strands. The volume electrical resistivity of the<br>
strand according to the invention is less than<br>
1000 Ω.cm, preferably 100 Ω.cm, advantageously 10 Ω.cm<br>
and better still 1 Ω.cm. The strands and the structures<br>
exhibiting a volume electrical resistivity varying from<br>
10 to 100 Ω.cm can be used for Joule effect heating.<br>
Those for which the said resistivity is less than or<br>
equal to 1 Ω.cm are more particularly suitable for<br>
electromagnetic shielding.<br>
The conducting strand and the strands which are<br>
constituents of the structure in accordance with the<br>
invention can be made of any kind of glass, for example<br>
E-, C-, R- and AR-glass. E-glass is preferred.<br><br>
The diameter of the glass filaments constitut-<br>
ing the strands can vary to a large extent, for example<br>
from 5 to 30 µm. In the same way, large variations can<br>
occur in the weight per unit length of the strand,<br>
which can range from 68 to 2400 tex according to the<br>
applications targeted.<br>
The conducting glass strand and the conducting<br>
structures in accordance with the invention can be used<br>
to reinforce various materials and thus to form<br>
conducting composite materials capable in particular of<br>
being heated by the Joule effect. As has already been<br>
said, such composite materials can be used for the<br>
heating of buildings or the de-icing of roads, bridges<br>
or landing runways.<br>
The structures can, as such, act as electro-<br>
magnetic shielding or heating elements applied at the<br>
surface or incorporated in wall faces or the ground.<br>
As shielding elements, the purpose of the<br>
structures is to weaken electromagnetic waves harmful<br>
to the satisfactory operation of electronic devices or<br>
to limit, indeed even prevent, the use of portable<br>
telephones in certain public or private places<br>
(hospitals, cinemas, prisons, and the like).<br>
Structures in the form of grids can be<br>
incorporated in particular in structures, for example<br>
bridges, to limit battery effects related to the<br>
presence of metal components which increase the risks<br>
of corrosion.<br>
The examples given below make it possible to<br>
illustrate the invention without, however, limiting it.<br>
In these examples, the following methods are<br>
used:<br>
&gt; The loss on ignition is measured in the<br>
following way: a predetermined amount (approximately<br>
1 gram) of cut strands is introduced into a porcelain<br>
crucible (weight W1). The crucible is heated in an oven<br>
at 105°C for 1 hour to evaporate the adsorbed water. On<br>
removal from the oven and after cooling, the crucible<br>
is weighed (weight W2) and is then heated in an oven at<br><br>
700°C for 5 hours. The crucible is weighed on removal<br>
from the oven after cooling under anhydrous conditions<br>
(weight W3).<br>
The loss on ignition is equal to: W2-W3/W2-W1.<br>
	The tensile strength of the strands is<br>
measured under the following conditions.<br>
The ends of a roving of a 2000 tex base strand,<br>
with a length of 240 mm, are placed between flat<br>
clamping jaws lined with Vulcolan over a distance of<br>
7 0 mm. The roving is drawn at the rate of 100 mm/min<br>
until it breaks. The strength is expressed in MPa.<br>
	The volume resistivity is obtained by the<br>
calculation from the relationship:<br>
ρ = R x S/1<br>
in which  ρ is the resistivity in Ω.cm,<br>
R is the resistance in Ω,<br>
S is the cross section of the<br>
strand in cm2,<br>
1 is the length of the fibre in<br>
cm.<br>
The resistance R is measured using an ohmmeter,<br>
the distance between the two electrodes being 20 cm.<br>
&gt;	The electromagnetic shielding, in dB, is<br>
measured under the conditions of Standard MIL-STD-285<br>
(27 June 1956) between 100 MHz and 2.7 GHz.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>

The composition is prepared by addition of the<br>
constituents to a receptacle containing water at 80°C<br>
which is kept vigorously stirred, the thickening agent<br>
being introduced first and the conducting particles<br>

b) Production of the glass strand<br>
A glass strand composed of 4000 filaments with<br>

2000 tex) unwound from a roving is immersed in a bath<br>
of the composition obtained under a). The strand enters<br>
the bath via a strand guide at the rate of 2.5 m/min,<br>
subsequently passes through a conical bushing (small<br>
diameter: 2.2 mm) and, at the outlet of the bath, is<br>
wound onto a frame rotating around an axis. The frame<br>
is placed in an oven heated at 105°C for 3 hours.<br>
The strand exhibits the following<br>

deviation: 23)<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
The operation is carried out under the<br>
conditions of Example 1, the conducting coating com-<br>
position comprising (in % by weight of solid matter):<br><br>
film-forming agent :polyvinylpyrrolidone(1) 20<br>
thickening agent: carboxymethylcellulose(2) 2<br>
plasticizers:<br>
•	bisphenol A bis(polyethylene glycol)  16<br>

•	octylphenoxypoly(ethyleneoxy)ethanol(4) 7<br>
cationic dispersant(5)	5<br>
conducting particles<br>
•	natural graphite powder(6) (mean size  25<br>
of the particles: 3 µm)<br>
•	expanded synthetic graphite(7) in the form 15<br>
of flakes (size of particles: 10-50 µm)<br>
•	synthetic graphite powder(9) (mean size of<br>
the particles: 10 µm)	10<br>
The viscosity of the composition is 5400 mPa•s<br>
at 20°C.<br>
The strand exhibits a loss on ignition of<br>
20.0%.<br>
The resistivity and tensile strength measure-<br>
ments of the strand before and after accelerated ageing<br>
are as follows (the standard deviation is given in<br>
brackets):<br>
Time (days)	t=0  t=1  t=14<br>
Resistivity (Ω.cm) 1.55 (0.4) 1.7 (0.2) 1.8 (0.2)<br>
Tensile strength (MPa) 1130 (62) 1044 (50) 950 (78)<br>
After ageing for 14 days, the resistivity is<br>
substantially unchanged and the tensile strength is<br>
equal to 84% of its initial value.<br>
EXAMPLES 3 AND 4<br>
These examples illustrate the effect of amount<br>
of conducting particles of high aspect ratio on the<br>
resistivity.<br>
The operation is carried out under the<br>
conditions of Example 1, modified in that the following<br>
compositions are used (in % by weight of solid matter):<br><br>
film-forming agent: polyvinyl-	2 0.0<br>
pyrrol idone(1)<br>
thickening agent: carboxymethyl-  2.00<br>
cellulose(2)<br>
plasticizers:<br>
•	bisphenol A bis(polyethylene glycol) 10.25<br>
ether(3)<br>
•	octylphenoxypoly(ethyleneoxy)	10.25<br>
ethanol(4)<br>
cationic dispersant(5)	7.50<br>
conducting particles<br>
•	graphite powder(10) in the form of  Ex.3 Ex.4<br>
flakes (size of the particles:<br>
10-50 urn)	2.5 15.0<br>
•	synthetic graphite powder(9) (mean<br>
size of the particles: 10 µm)  47.5 35.0<br>
The viscosities of the compositions are<br>
4900 mPa•s and 5400 mPa•s respectively at 20°C.<br>
The strands obtained exhibit the following<br>
characteristics (the standard deviation is given in<br>
brackets):<br>
Ex. 3	Ex. 4<br>
Loss on ignition (%)  20.4	19.8<br>
Resistivity (Ω.cm)  2.9 (0.8)	2.3 (0.3)<br>
Tensile strength (MPa) 1320 (115)	1348 (58)<br>
It is found that an increase in the relative<br>
proportion of particles in the form of flakes, at an<br>
equivalent total amount of particles, makes it possible<br>
to reduce the resistivity and thus to increase the<br>
electrical conductivity.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
The operation is carried out under the<br>
conditions of Example 1, modified in that the strand is<br>
composed of 800 filaments with a diameter of 13.6 urn<br>
(weight per unit length: 300 tex), that the small<br>
diameter of the bushing is equal to 1.2 mm and that the<br>
conducting coating composition comprises (as % by<br><br>
weight of solid matter):<br>

tics (the standard deviation is given in brackets):<br>

after storing at 20°C for 15 weeks<br>
&gt;	Tensile strength: 1361 (93) MPa.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
The operation is carried out under the<br>
conditions of Example 1, the conducting coating com-<br>

form of flakes (size of the particles:<br>

•	synthetic graphite powder(17) (size of  10.0<br>
the particles: 1-10 µm)<br><br>
• carbon black powder(12) (mean size of  20.0<br>
the particles: 50 µm)<br>
The viscosity of the composition is 590 MPa • s<br>
at 2 0°C.<br>
The strand exhibits a loss on ignition of<br>
42.1%.<br>
The resistivity and the tensile strength of the<br>
strand, before and after accelerated ageing, are given<br>
below (the standard deviation appears in brackets):<br>
Time (days)	t = 0	t = 1	t = 3<br>
Resistivity (Ω.cm)  0.18	0.18	0.18<br>
(0.01)	(0.03)	(0.01)<br>

The operation is carried out under the condi-<br>
tions of Example 1, the conducting coating composition<br>
comprising (as % by weight of solid matter):<br>
film-forming agents:<br>

The viscosity of the composition is 190 mPa•s<br>
at 20°C.<br>
The strand exhibits the following<br><br>
characteristics:<br>

EXAMPLE 9<br>
This example illustrates the influence of the<br>
amount of coating on the electrical conductivity and<br>
the mechanical properties of the strand..<br>
a)	Preparation of the coating composition<br>
A composition is prepared comprising (as % by<br>
weight of solid matter):<br>
film-forming agent:<br>
•	styrene-butadiene copolymer(18)	46.5<br>
nonionic dispersant(11)	6.0<br>
antifoaming agent(19)	1.0<br>
conducting particles<br>
•	expanded synthetic graphite(7) in the form 18.6<br>
of flakes (size of the particles:<br>
10-50 µm)<br>
•	synthetic graphite powder(17) (size of the 9.3<br>
particles: 1-10 µm)<br>
•	carbon black powder(12) (size of the	18.6<br>
particles: 50 nm)<br>
The composition is prepared by addition of the<br>
constituents to a receptacle containing water at<br>
ambient temperature (approximately 25°C) with vigorous<br>
stirring, the conducting particles being introduced<br>
last.<br>
The composition exhibits a viscosity of<br>
800 mPa•s at 20°C.<br>
b)	Production of the glass strand<br>
The operation is carried out under the<br>
conditions of Example 1, modified in that the glass<br>
strand is composed of 800 filaments with a diameter of<br>
13 µm (weight per unit length: 275 tex).<br>
A variable amount of conducting coating com-<br>
position is deposited on the glass strand (Tests 1 to<br>
3) .<br><br>
Test 1 Test 2 Test 3<br>
 Loss on ignition (%)  21.9  30.6 45.7<br>
Volume resistivity (Ω.cm) 0.23  0.16 0.14<br>
Tensile strength (MPa)  2035  2045 2059<br>
It is found that the volume resistivity-<br>
decreases as a function of the amount of coating<br>
composition deposited on the strand, which means that<br>
the electrical conductivity is increased. At the same<br>
time, the tensile strength level is virtually unchanged<br>
(the increase observed not being significant).<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
The operation is carried out under the<br>
conditions of Example 9 while varying the ratio by<br>
weight of the conducting particles (P) to the sum of<br>
the conducting particles (P) and of the film-forming<br>
agent (F). The loss on ignition is between 21 and 23%.<br>
Test  P/P+F (%)  Volume resistivity (Ω.cm)<br>
1	25	4.11<br>
2	30	1.14<br>
3	35	0.75<br>
4	40	0.42<br>
5	50	0.23<br>
6	60	0.24<br>
For these values, it is deduced that the<br>
percolation threshold (corresponding to the P/P+F ratio<br>
starting from which the strand exhibits a satisfactory<br>
conductivity) is between 30 and 35%.<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
a) Preparation of the coating composition<br>
The operation is carried out under the<br>
conditions of Example 9, the coating composition<br>
comprising (as % by weight of solid matter):<br>
film-forming agent:<br>
•	styrene-butadiene copolymer(20)	46.5<br>
nonionic dispersant(11)	6.0<br>
antifoaming agent(19)	1.0<br>
conducting particles<br>
•	expanded synthetic graphite(7) in the form 18.6<br>
of flakes (size of the particles:<br><br>
10-50 µm)<br>
•	synthetic graphite powder(17) (size of the 9.3<br>
particles: 1-10 µm)<br>
•	carbon black powder(12) (size of the	18.6<br>
particles: 50 nm)<br>
The composition exhibits a viscosity of<br>
230 mPa•s at 20°C.<br>
b) Production of the glass fabric<br>
A glass fabric (weight per unit area: 165 g/m2)<br>
exhibiting a square mesh of 3 5 mm and a thickness of<br>
0.4 mm is immersed in a vat with a width of 3 00 mm<br>
filled with the composition obtained under a) . At the<br>
outlet of the vat, the fabric is squeezed by passing<br>
between the two rolls of a calender (pressure: 0.6 bar;<br>
speed of rotation: 0.5 m/min) and then it passes into<br>
an air oven comprising 4 compartments heated at 90°C,<br>
130°C, 150°C and 90°C respectively. The residence time<br>
in each compartment is 2 minutes.<br>
Various tests were carried out with a level of<br>
coating (weight of coating/weight of uncoated fabric)<br>
of 30% (Test 1), 60% (Test 2) and 115% (Test 3).<br>
Several passes through the impregnation bath were<br>
carried out in order to obtain the highest levels<br>
(Tests 2 and 3).<br>
The curve of the electromagnetic shielding as a<br>
function of the frequency is given in Figure 1.<br>
The fabric according to the invention exhibits<br>
a shielding value of greater than 5 dB and of less than<br>
25 dB depending on the level of coating, over the<br>
entire frequency range examined.<br>
It is specified that a shielding value of 10 dB<br>
corresponds to a weakening in the strength of the<br>
electrical field by a factor of 3, a value of 20 dB<br>
corresponds to a weakening by a factor of 10 and a<br>
value of 3 0 dB corresponds to a weakening by a factor<br>
of 30.<br>
Tests 1 to 3 exhibit values of the same order<br>
of magnitude as the available fabrics which are<br>
suitable for electromagnetic shielding. In particular,<br><br>
the level of performance of Test 2 is comparable with<br>
that which is obtained with a fabric based on copper<br>
wires and on glass strands which are comingled and<br>
provided with a conducting coating and which are<br>
arranged in weft and in warp. However, this fabric is<br>
not entirely satisfactory as, on the one hand, the<br>
contact of the copper wires at the crossing points is<br>
not always assured and, on the other hand, the copper<br>
has a tendency to oxidize to form an insulating surface<br>
layer which results in a reduction in the electrical<br>
conductivity.<br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>
The operation is carried out under the<br>
conditions of Example 11, modified in that the coating<br>
composition comprises (as % by weight of solid matter):<br>
film-forming agent:<br>
•	styrene-butadiene copolymer(20)	37.0<br>
nonionic dispersant(11)	7.0<br>
antifoaming agent(19)	1.0<br>
conducting particles<br>
•	expanded synthetic graphite(7)	22.0<br>
•	synthetic graphite powder(17)	11.0<br>
•	carbon black powder(12)	22.0<br>
The composition exhibits a viscosity of<br>
545 mPa•s at 20°C.<br>
The fabric was impregnated with a level of<br>
coating of 32% (Test 1), 64% (Test 2) and 160%<br>
(Test 3) .<br>
The curve of the electromagnetic shielding as a<br>
function of the frequency is given in Figure 2.<br>
It is observed that Tests 1 to 3 exhibit<br>
improved levels of performance in comparison with those<br>
of Example 11.<br><br>
