				<td>A CLOSURE FOR A VIAL OR A PLUNGER FOR A HYPODERMIC SYRIIGE<br>
MADE WHOLLY OR PARTLY OF AN ELASTOMER MATERIAL<br>
This invention relates to a novel product comprising a novel elastomer<br>
material, to uses of this elastomer material, to products made using it, and processes<br>
for making and using it.<br>
Elastomer materials are well .known and have innumerable uses. A particular<br>
use is for the manufacture of closures for pharmaceutical vials and plungers for<br>
hypodermic syringes.<br>
Drug substance and vaccine products are frequently provided in vials which<br>
are closed with an elastomer closure part through which a hollow needle can be<br>
passed, puncturing the closure part, and via which the drug substance or vaccine<br>
product may be extracted for use, optionally after reconstitution by an aqueous<br>
medium introduced into the vial via the needle. Normally such a vial has a mouth<br>
opening bounded by a flange-shaped :im, and the closure part is held in a closing<br>
relationship with the mouth opening by a flexible metal clamp part which surrounds<br>
the perimeter of the closure part and I olds it tightly against the rim.<br>
It is also known, e.g. from WO-A-02/064439 and WO-A-04/08317, to provide<br>
a pharmaceutical vial having a closure part made partly or wholly of thermoplastic<br>
elastomer material, and e.g. from WO -A-03/028785 to provide a hypodermic syringe<br>
having a plunger made partly of a thermoplastic elastomer material. Such a vial or<br>
syringe can be filled using a hollow needle passed through the closure part or plunger<br>
respectively, the needle is then withdrawn, and the small residual puncture hole in the<br>
closure or plunger may then be sealed by heat sealing, e.g. using a focused laser beam.<br>
Known elastomer materials present problems when they are used as a material<br>
for the closure part or plunger disclosed respectively in WO-A-02/064439, WO-A-<br>
03/028785 or WO-A-04/08317. For example known polymers generate smoke as they<br>
are heated by the laser beam, which may contaminate the contents of the vial. Known<br>
polymers also have a low diffusion of the laser power so that a significant proportion<br>
of the laser power can pass through the closure or plunger to the contents of the vial or<br>
syringe, possibly damaging the contents.<br>
It is an object of this invention to address these problems of the state of the art.<br>
Other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following<br>
description.<br><br>
According to this invention an elastomer material is provided, having an<br>
absorption coefficient for laser light of 0.5 - 2.5 mm-1.<br>
As will be seen below the principal intended use of the elastomer material of<br>
the invention is for pharmaceutical vial closures and plungers for hypodermic syringes<br>
in which a residual puncture hole can be made and sealed by melting the elastomer<br>
material adjacent the residual puncture hole with a beam of laser radiation directed at<br>
the site of the puncture.<br>
For this purpose suitably the elastomer material is based upon a base<br>
thermoplastic elastomer ("TPE") which has a melting point less than 200°C,<br>
preferably 180°C or less. The base TPE may also be selected on the basis of properties<br>
known to be suitable for use as vial closures and plungers, e.g. elasticity, hardness,<br>
compatibility with pharmaceutical uses etc.<br>
Preferably the elastomer material of the invention comprises a base<br>
thermoplastic elastomer compounder! with a colourant to have the absorption<br>
coefficient for laser light of 0.5 - 2.5 mm-1.<br>
Preferably the base TPE is a styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene ("SEBS")<br>
thermoplastic elastomer. Such elastomers are well known, e.g. with a resin modifier<br>
which interacts with the polystyrene end blocks, essentially increasing their size and<br>
their effective glass transition temperature, or styrene-emylene/butylene-styrene -<br>
styrene-butylene-styrene ("SEBS-SBK") copolymers. Known TPE's of this type may<br>
be based on known Kraton™ SEBS elastomers. Such elastomers have low<br>
compression set at room temperature, i.e. when stretched they show little tendency to<br>
neck, making them suitable for sealing against rigid surfaces, such as the mouths and<br>
necks of pharmaceutical vials. A preferred type of SEBS elastomer is that available<br>
under the name Evoprene™ for example from Laporte Alphagary, particularly the<br>
SEBS with resin modifier materials available under the name Evoprene™ Super G, in<br>
particular Evoprene™ Super G 948, Hvoprene™ TS2525 also being suitable but<br>
having a less favourable water permeability than Super G 948. Other suitable SEBS<br>
elastomers include the SEBS-styrene butadiene styrene material available under the<br>
name Cawiton™, e.g. the SEBS-SBS material Cawiton™ PR5947 available from<br>
Wittenburg (NL) and C-FIex R70-001 available from CPT (USA). SEBS elastomer<br>
materials with simitar properties to these would also be suitable.<br><br>
Other types of base TPE may be used, for example styrene/butadiene/styrene<br>
("SBS") tri-block copolymers, and styrene-(butadiene/butylene)-sryrene ("SBBS") tri-<br>
block copolymers.<br>
The colourant imparts a colour to the elastomer material of the invention. The<br>
property of having a colour inheremly means that light of certain wavelength is<br>
absorbed rather than transmitted by the coloured material, and it is principally the<br>
colour of the elastomer that is responsible for the absorption coefficient. The colour<br>
imparted is not critical provided that the defined absorption coefficient is achieved. It<br>
is believed that depth of colour rather than the colour itself may be the important<br>
factor in determining the absorption coefficient, but a grey colour is suitable.<br>
The colourant preferably comprises a pigment or a mixture of pigments mixed<br>
with a carrier material. The carrier material is suitably a polymer which can be<br>
compounded with the elastomer. Such colourants are commonly used in the field of<br>
manufacture of polymer, including elastomer, products and the mixture of pigment<br>
and carrier material is known in the art as a "masterbatch". It is a standard process in<br>
this field to prepare a colour masterbtitch of a defined colour and/or composition<br>
which can easily be reproduced, and to compound this masterbatch in a defined ratio<br>
with a bulk of elastomer to produce an elastomer of a reproducible colour.<br>
A suitable pigment has the grey-green colour Pantone 5497C or a similar grey<br>
or grey-green colour. The Pantone Matching System (PMS) is a system shared world<br>
wide by the graphic arts industry. Similar colours include Pantone 556C, 5565C,<br>
563C, 570C, 5S55C. Suitably a mixture of pigments may comprise a mixture of the<br>
pigments: white 6 (typically titanium. iioxide), black 7 (typically carbon black), green<br>
7 (typically copper phthalocyanine CAS No. 1328-53-6) and blue 29 (typically<br>
ultramarine blue). These pigments are also standard nomenclature in the art, e.g. as<br>
referenced under their INCI name. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art how to<br>
prepare a pigment of colour Pantone 5497C or a similar grey colour using such<br>
pigments.<br>
Various suitable carrier materials for TPE's are known in the art. For example<br>
ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), low density polyethylene (LDPE) and polypropylene<br>
(PP). Appropriate carrier materials of this type for a particular base TPE and for use in<br><br>
pharmaceutical applications are well known in the polymers art and are available from<br>
numerous suppliers e.g. PolyColour Plastics Ltd., Telford, Shropshire GB.<br>
The amount of pigment used in the colourant to make the masterbatch, and the<br>
amount of the colourant masterbatch mixed with the elastomer will vary from<br>
application to application, for example depending upon the natural colour of the SEBS<br>
thermoplastic elastomer, but can be determined empirically to achieved the desired<br>
absorption coefficient. For example the colourant mixture may comprise 10-50,<br>
typically 40+/-5, wt.% pigment, the balance up to 100% comprising the carrier<br>
material.<br>
Typically the elastomer material of the invention may comprise 1 - 15wt.%,<br>
typically 3-14 wt%, preferably 1 - 10wt.% of colourant (masterbatch), the balance<br>
up to 100% comprising the base TPE, Compounding of the masterbatch with the base<br>
TPE is a well known conventional pi ocedure.<br>
A preferred elastomer maternil of the invention comprises a SEBS elastomer<br>
such as preferably Evoprene™ Super G, compounded with 1-5 wt%, especially 1.2 -<br>
2 wt% of a colourant masterbatch comprising an EVA carrier with 35 - 45wt% of<br>
pigment of a colour Pantone 5497 or similar colour, e.g. based on the mixture of<br>
pigments listed above.<br>
Another suitable elastomer material of the invention comprises Evoprene™<br>
TS2525, compounded with 1-5 wt%, especially 1.2-2 wt% of a colourant<br>
masterbatch comprising an EVA carrier with 35 - 45wt% of pigment of a colour<br>
Pantone 5497 or similar colour, e.g. based on the mixture of pigments listed above.<br>
Another suitable elastomer material of the invention comprises a SEBS-SBS<br>
elastomer preferably Cawiton™ PR5947, compounded with 3-15 wt% of a colourant<br>
masterbatch comprising an LDPE can ier with 15-20 wt% of pigment of a colour<br>
Pantone 5497 or similar colour, e.g. bused on the mixture of pigments listed above.<br>
The absorption coefficient relates to the thickness in mm of the elastomer<br>
material in which 99% of laser radiation energy incident upon a surface of the<br>
elastomer material is absorbed. If the laser radiation is absorbed too close to the<br>
surface upon which the radiation impinges then the surface can become too hot when<br>
used, in the principal intended use outlined above and smoke and other pyrolytic<br>
decomposition products may be emittet If the laser radiation is not absorbed by the<br><br>
thickness of a pharmaceutical vial closure or plunger it may pass through and affect<br>
the contents of the vial or syringe. Typically the thickness of the part of a vial closure<br>
to he used in the above mentioned purpose is 0.5 - 2.5 mm, typically 1.5 - 2.5 mm,<br>
preferably ca. 2mm and it is preferned that the absorption coefficient and thickness of<br>
the part is such that at an incident laser power of up to 8W less than 6% of the laser<br>
power passes through into the vial. Although the laser radiation wavelength is not<br>
critical a wavelength of 980nm is suitable, at a laser power of up to ca. 20W,<br>
preferably up to ca. 4 - 10W, e.g. ca. 8.0+/- 0.5W. The absorption coefficient is<br>
preferably in the range 1.0 - 2.5 mm-l preferably 1.5 - 2.2 mm'1, ideally as close to<br>
1.5 mm"1 as can be achieved, e.g. 1.4-1.6 mm-1.<br>
The absorption coefficient OC may be measured using methods apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art based on the Beer-Lambert law. One such method involves<br>
relating incident laser power arriving at the incident surface (Pi) to the laser power<br>
transmitted through the material (Pt): .e. emerging from the opposite surface, in the<br>
relationship:<br><br>
Where (X is the absorption coefficient and L is the thickness of the material. For<br>
example a measuring system may comprise a suitable laser of power low enough that<br>
the properties of the material are not affected e.g. by thermal decomposition e.g.<br>
generating 200 - 400 mW, directing the laser light along a suitable light guide, e.g. an<br>
optic fibre, toward a power measuring instrument. The laser power detected in the<br>
absence of any material between the li ght guide and the instrument may be defined as<br>
Pi. Material of measured thickness L may then be positioned between the light guide<br>
and the instrument and the laser powei detected by the instrument may then be<br>
measured as Pt. For accuracy the measurement may be done repeatedly with one layer<br>
of the material, giving a Pt1, then with a stack of two layers of the material, giving a<br>
measurement Pt2, then with a stack of three layers of the material, giving a<br>
measurement Pt3. Two values of a may then be calculated by the relationships:<br><br><br><br>
The value of a for the material may then be calculated as the mean of all the<br>
measured values of α, e.g. of α1 and α2.<br>
The process of compounding of the elastomer of this invention is standard in<br>
the art of elastomer manufacture, and numerous competent organisations are known<br>
which are capable of manufacturing such an elastomer and the appropriate colourant<br>
masterbatches.<br>
The elastomer material of this invention may also incorporate other materials<br>
common in the field of manufacture of closures for pharmaceutical vials. For example<br>
the material may contain a filler, typically ca. 20%. Suitable fillers should be selected<br>
from materials which are compatible or use in such applications, e.g. being of<br>
pharmaceutical grade. For example although calcium carbonate may be used as a filler<br>
this can affect the pH of liquids contai ned in the vial. Apreferred filler is Kaolin<br>
(China Clay) of a pharmaceutical grads. An example of such Kaolin is that available<br>
under the brand Polestar 200P, from Ineryis Minerals Ltd., (GB).<br>
In a further aspect the present invention provides a closure for a<br>
pharmaceutical vial made wholly or partly of an elastomer material as described<br>
above.<br>
In a further aspect the present invention provides a plunger for a hypodermic<br>
syringe made wholly or partly of an elastomer material as described above.<br>
The hardness, elasticity etc. of the base TPE selected for use in the<br>
manufacture of such a vial closure or syringe plunger may be typical of TPE's<br>
presently used for closures and plungers. The base TPE and all other components of<br>
the elastomer when used for a vial closure or syringe plunger must be compatible with<br>
medical use.<br>
Such a closure or plunger is preferably adapted so that a vial or syringe<br>
provided with such a closure or plunger may be used in a process in which the point of<br>
a hollow needle is passed through the closure part or plunger so that the point is<br>
within the vial, a fluid contents material such as a drug or vaccine solution or<br><br>
suspension, or a reconstitution fluid is introduced into the vial or syringe through the<br>
needle, the needle is then withdraw 1, and the small residual puncture hole left by the<br>
needle in the closure or plunger is sealed by heat sealing of the outside of the closure<br>
or plunger, e.g. using a focused laser beam.<br>
WO-A-04/08317 and WO-A-02/064439 respectively disclose a vial closure of<br>
monolithic construction and of two-part, i.e. having a base portion, and a re-sealable<br>
portion made of a fusible material, construction. WO-A-03/0287785 discloses a<br>
syringe plunger having a penetrable region which is fusible. The closure and plunger<br>
of the latter two aspects of this invention may be constructed in the manner described<br>
respectively in WO-A-04/08317, WO-A-02/064439 and WO-A-03/0287785, and the<br>
elastomer material of this invention Maybe used as the fusible material thereof.<br>
Advantageously, the closure and plunger of the latter two aspects of this<br>
invention may be of single-part construction, i.e. made entirely of the elastomer<br>
material of this invention, as for example disclosed in WO-A-04/08317.<br>
A closure of this aspect of the invention may be of generally conventional<br>
construction, but for example a suitable construction of a closure part for a vial which<br>
may be made from the elastomer material of the invention is described as the "closure<br>
part" in applicant's WO-A-04/08317.<br>
Such a closure may comprise an upper part comprising a closure wall and<br>
descending therefrom a lower plug part which can fit into the mouth opening of a vial,<br>
and preferably at least the upper surface of the closure wall, preferably the entire<br>
closure wall, preferably the whole of the closure part is made of the thermoplastic<br>
elastomer material of the invention, so that a puncture hole through the closure wall<br>
formed as a result of filling the vial us ing a hollow needle as described above may be<br>
sealed by thermal sealing, e.g. using a focused light beam such as a laser. The closure<br>
wall normally extends across the mouth opening of the vial. Typically the closure wall<br>
of such a closure has a thickness ca. 2 mm. Such a closure may also comprise a flange<br>
part to form a seal between the closure and the rim of the mouth opening of the vial.<br>
Typically the closure wall of such a closure has a thickness ca. 2 mm.<br>
Therefore the invention further provides a closure for a pharmaceutical vial<br>
having a closure wall comprised of an elastomer material such that when laser light is<br>
directed on the outer surface of the clo sure wall 99% of the laser power is absorbed<br><br>
within 0.5 - 2.5 mm depth from the outer surface, preferably within 1.0 - 2.5 mm-1<br>
preferably 1.5 - 2.2 mm"1, ideally as close to 1.5 mm"1 as can be achieved, e.g. 1.4 -<br>
1.6 mm", with the effect of melting the material. The elastomer material of the<br>
present invention provides the advantage that under irradiation from a focused 980nm<br>
laser of power less than 20W, typically 4-10 W, e.g. ca. 8 W the thermoplastic<br>
elastomer material easily fuses e.g. titer ca. 0.5 - 2 seconds, e.g. 1 second maximum<br>
irradiation, and sets on cooling without emission of significant quantities of<br>
contaminating smoke. The defined absorption coefficient has the advantage that when<br>
the closure wall of such a closure is of a conventional thickness e.g. ca. 2.0mm a<br>
negligible amount of laser power, typically less than 6% may penetrate through the<br>
closure to reach the interior.<br>
Therefore in a further aspect he present invention provides a closure for a<br>
pharmaceutical vial, or a plunger for a hypodermic syringe, made wholly or partly of a<br>
thermoplastic elastomer compoundec. with a colourant to the extent that less than 6%,<br>
preferably less than 4%, preferably less than 2%, of laser light of wavelength 980nm<br>
and incident power up to 8W penetra:es through the closure to reach the interior of the<br>
vial or plunger.<br>
Preferred elastomer materials, colourants and compositions for such an<br>
elastomer material are as discussed above.<br>
The closure and plunger of this invention, may be made by methods involving<br>
conventional injection moulding processes.<br>
In a further aspect of this inveition a process is provided for introducing a<br>
substance into a vial comprising: providing a vial having a mouth opening closed by a<br>
closure of this invention, passing a hollow needle through the closure, introducing the<br>
substance into the vial via the needle, withdrawing the needle from the vial and<br>
closure, and sealing the small residua] puncture hole in the closure by heat sealing, i.e.<br>
by heating the elastomer material of the closure adjacent the puncture site so that the<br>
material fuses, e.g. using a focused laser beam, then allowing the material to cool and<br>
set.<br>
	Suitable holow needles are known in the art, but preferred hollow needles are<br>
disclosed in PCT/EP04/004501.<br><br>
In a preferred form of this process the heating of the elastomer material of the<br>
closure adjacent the puncture site so that the material fuses is done by directing laser<br>
light, preferably focused, onto the elastomer material adjacent the puncture site.<br>
Suitably the laser beam may have a power less than 20W, typically 4 - 10W, e.g.<br>
typically nominally 8 W. Suitably th e laser beam may have a wavelength of nominally<br>
980nm. Lasers of this type are comnercially available e.g. red - infrared diode lasers,<br>
typically having an output in the range 960-1000nm. Typically in the process of the<br>
invention such a laser beam may be directed at the elastomer material adjacent to the<br>
puncture site for a suitable length of time to achieve melting of the elastomer material<br>
such that through at least part of the thickness of the closure the melted elastomer<br>
material fuses to close the puncture hole. Suitably the laser beam may be focused to<br>
form a spot of dimension 0.1 - 2, preferably 0.1 -1.0, mm across the beam direction<br>
on the surface of the closure. Preferasly the area of the spot is greater than the area of<br>
the puncture hole, e.g. at least 1.5 times greater, preferably at least 2 times greater,<br>
more preferably 3 or more times greater. Under such conditions the elastomer material<br>
may be raised to a suitable temperature in excess of its melting point during ca. 0.5 - 2<br>
seconds exposure to such a laser beam. During such a process the temperature of the<br>
elastomer material adjacent the puncture site maybe measured using a suitable<br>
temperature sensor, or the equipment used to perform the process may be pre-<br>
calibrated to achieve the suitable temperature.<br>
Suitably the process may be performed with the vial with its closure being<br>
conveyed on a conveyor system into a position adjacent to a suitable source of laser<br>
light, for example an optical guide to iirect and focus laser light onto the closure. A<br>
suitable form of conveyor is for example disclosed in WO-A-04/026735. Whilst the<br>
vial with its closure are in the position adjacent to a suitable source of laser light the<br>
source of laser light and the vial may be relatively arranged, for example the conveyor<br>
system and the source of laser light may be relatively arranged, so that there is no<br>
relative movement of the closure and the spot on the closure at which the laser light is<br>
focused. For example the conveyor may convey fee vial in a conveying direction, and<br>
whilst the laser light is directed at the closure the motion of the conveyor may be<br>
temporarily halted, or alternatively the source of laser light may be moveable by<br>
known means so that there is no relative motion in the conveying direction between<br><br>
the closure and the spot on the closure at which the laser light is focused.<br>
Conveniently an obstructer means, e.g. an optical shutter may be provided between the<br>
source of laser light and such a conveyor to obstruct laser light from reaching the<br>
closure except when required for this purpose of sealing the puncture site.<br>
Preferably in this process, btsfore the step of passing a hollow needle through<br>
the closure the area of the closure through which the needle is to pass, preferably the<br>
entire outer surface of the closure, more preferably also the entire outer surface of the<br>
vial, is sterilised by exposure to radiation. A preferred radiation is electron beam ("e-<br>
beam") radiation. A suitable process for sterilising the outer surface of the closure and<br>
vial is for example disclosed in PCI/EP04/001752, in which vials conveyed into a<br>
shielded enclosure, exposed to electron beam radiation in this enclosure, then<br>
conveyed out of the enclosure before the step of passing a hollow needle through the<br>
closure.<br>
Preferably in this process, before the substance is introduced into the vial via<br>
the needle, the interior of the vial is stterile. In a preferred form of the process vials<br>
with their mouths closed by the closures are provided with their interiors sterile by the<br>
process disclosed in the PCT application claiming priority from GB 0315953.0 filed<br>
08 July 2003, in which vials and closures are made by moulding under conditions<br>
such that the moulded vials and closures are sterile, then the vials and closures are<br>
assembled in a sterile (aseptic) environment. The elastomer materials of this invention<br>
are suitable for this process.<br>
In a further aspect a process is provided for introducing a substance into a<br>
hypodermic syringe comprising: providing a syringe having a plunger of this<br>
invention, passing a hollow needle through the plunger, introducing the substance into<br>
the vial via the needle, withdrawing the needle from the syringe and plunger, and<br>
sealing the small residual puncture hole in the plunger by heat sealing, e.g. using a<br>
focused laser beam as described above.<br>
The invention will now be de scribed by way of non-limiting example only.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a longitudinal section through a pharmaceutical vial and a closure<br>
made of elastomer material of this indention.<br>
Figs. 2-5 show the use of the vial of Fig. 1 in a filling process.<br>
Example 1: Elastomer material compositions.<br><br><br>
In these Examples the base e astomer, in a grade suitable for use in a<br>
pharmaceutical vial closure, was supplied from the suppliers indicated below. In each<br>
Example the colourant Masterbatch is composed of the carrier compounded with the<br>
pigment at the indicated pigment loading. In each Example the pigment is made up of<br>
the pigments white 6, black 7, green 7 and blue 29 in suitable proportions to achieve<br>
the Pantone 5497 colour. In each Example the Masterbatch was made up by a<br>
commercial colourant compounder using known grades of the carrier material suitable<br>
for use in a pharmaceutical vial closu re and given the Compounder's reference as<br>
below.<br><br>
The compounding procedure for making up the colourant Masterbatch and<br>
then compounding the base elastomer with the Masterbatch was entirely conventional<br><br>
in the elastomer art. A requirement was set that 99% of laser power of 8W at 980nm<br>
was to be absorbed after passage through a maximum of 2mm of the elastomer i.e. an<br>
absorption coefficient a as defined above of 2mm"1, optimally 1.5mm"1. The base<br>
elastomer was taken and its absorpt on coefficient a was measured. Various blends of<br>
base elastomer and the colourant masterbatch were then compounded with various<br>
proportions % of the masterbatch arid the absorption coefficient a for each blend was<br>
measured so a graph of OC against % masterbatch could be made. From this graph and<br>
based on the Beer-Lambert law a compound of base elastomer and masterbatch could<br>
be made having the desired absorption coefficient a.<br>
Each of the elastomer materiils of Examples 1-4 had an absorption<br>
coefficient CC as defined above of ca 1.5 mm"1 for laser light of wavelength 980nm,<br>
measured using the method described above, i.e. 99% of such laser light at a power<br>
8W was absorbed in this thickness of the elastomer material. This resulted in melting<br>
of the elastomer material adjacent a puncture hole in ca. 1 second.<br>
The elastomer materials of Examples 1-4 could easily be made by injection<br>
moulding into vial closures of conventional shape or as disclosed in WO-A-04/08317<br>
using a conventional injection mould ing procedure.<br>
Such a vial closure is shown in Fig. 1, in which vial 10 shown in longitudinal<br>
sectioned view has an upper mouth o pening 11 closed by a closure 20. Closure 20<br>
comprises an upper closure wall 21 from which descends a plug part 22 which fits in a<br>
tight sealing fit in the mouth opening 11 of vial 10. The closure also has a peripheral<br>
flange 23 which mates with a flange .2 of the vial 10. The closure 20 is held in place<br>
on vial 10 as shown by clamp part 30 which snap-fits over the flange 12. The central<br>
part 21A of closure wall 21 has a thickness ca. 2mm.<br>
When made of any of the matisrials of Examples 1-4 above it was found that<br>
such closures 20 could easily be punc hired by a needle (not shown) passed in a<br>
downward direction as shown through the central part 21A of closure wall 21, and<br>
when the needle was subsequently wihdrawn the residual puncture hole could be<br>
sealed in a few seconds by melting the surrounding elastomer material with a focused<br>
laser beam of wavelength 980nm and power 8W then allowing the melted material to<br><br>
cool and set. Negligible smoke or ether volatile potential contaminants were emitted<br>
from the elastomer material during this process. Also it was found that with a closure<br>
wall (i.e. the part 24 identified in Fig. 1 of WO-A-04/08317) thickness of l-2mm less<br>
than 6% of the laser power was transmitted through the closure wall to reach the<br>
interior of the vial.<br>
This process is shown schematically in Figs. 2-5. Fig. 2 shows a vial 10 plus<br>
closure 20 and clamp 30 as in Fig. 1. Fig. 3 shows how a hollow filling needle 40 has<br>
been passed through part 21A of closure wall 21 and liquid content 50 introduced into<br>
vial 10 via needle 40, air venting oux of the vial 10 between the needle 40 and closure<br>
20, assisted by venting grooves (not shown) in the outer surface of needle 40. Fig. 4<br>
shows that the needle 40 has been w ithdrawn, leaving a residual puncture hole 60<br>
through the part 21A of the closure v/all 21. Fig. 5 shows that laser light 70 is focused<br>
onto the upper surface of part 21A and is absorbed as heat to result in melting of the<br>
zone 21B of wall 21 i.e. to a depth of ca. 1.5mm, thereby on subsequent cooling and<br>
solidifying of the melted material of closure 20 sealing puncture hole 60.<br><br>
