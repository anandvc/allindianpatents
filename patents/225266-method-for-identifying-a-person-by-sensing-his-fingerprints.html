				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to improvements made to<br>
the methods for identifying a person among a<br>
population, by sensing the fingerprints of at least one<br>
finger of the hand of said person and comparing these<br>
fingerprints with fingerprint information of all the<br>
persons of said population previously stored in a file.<br>
It will firstly be stressed that the invention is<br>
essentially concerned with the "identification" of a<br>
person taken from a population, that is to say with the<br>
comparison of a person's characteristic elements with<br>
characteristic elements stored in a file and grouping<br>
together the characteristic elements of all the persons<br>
of the population, and that the invention does not<br>
relate to the "authentication" of a person, that is to<br>
say the comparison of the persons characteristic<br>
elements with identical characteristic elements held in<br>
a file which is queried or that said person holds in<br>
duplicate (chip card secret code for example).<br>
It is known to identify a person, with a small risk of<br>
error, with the aid of the fingerprints of at least one<br>
of his/her fingers of at least one of his/her hands.<br>
There are currently various types of devices making it<br>
possible to sense fingerprints, and the corresponding<br>
information, transformed into the form of digitized<br>
electrical signals, may be stored for subsequent<br>
comparison and identification purposes.<br>
The comparison of the fingerprints sensed on a finger<br>
of a person with the digitized information stored in a<br>
file is a relatively complex and lengthy operation. The<br>
identification, through this criterion alone, of a<br>
person, among a population of several million, or even<br>
several tens, or even several hundreds of millions of<br>
persons is certainly still achievable, but in practice<br>
would require very sizeable computing means.<br>
Certainly, a preselection performed according to other<br>
criteria could be performed. For example, a<br>
straightforward preselection could be undertaken<br>
according to the sex of the persons; however, such a<br>
preselection affords approximately only a halving of<br>
the information to be processed, which is very<br>
inadequate and would not significantly cut the<br>
aforesaid cost of the hardware required.<br>
The aim of the invention is essentially to propose a<br>
particular solution to the problem which arises, which<br>
solution must make it possible to reduce the<br>
fingerprint-based identification process to a<br>
comparison pertaining to an amount of stored<br>
information which is sufficiently restricted for it to<br>
be possible to undertake this comparison under<br>
acceptable speed and cost conditions, while retaining a<br>
number of characteristic points which is high enough<br>
for the identification to remain reliable.<br>
For these purposes, the invention proposes a method as<br>
mentioned in the preamble which is characterized in<br>
that the shape of at least one hand of all the persons<br>
of the population is sensed previously and the hand<br>
shape information is stored in said file in correlation<br>
with at least the respective fingerprint information,<br>
then in that at the time of identification of a person:<br>
the shape of the hand of the person is sensed at<br>
the same time as the fingerprints of at least one of<br>
his/her fingers are sensed;<br>
the shape information for his/her hand is compared<br>
with the hand shape information held in memory in the<br>
file for the entire population;<br>
a group consisting of the hand shapes<br>
substantially identical to the sensed hand shape of the<br>
person to be identified is selected from said file; and<br>
finally, the sensed fingerprints of the finger of<br>
the person to be identified are compared with the<br>
information stored in the file in correlation with<br>
respectively the hand shapes, of only the persons of<br>
the abovesaid selected group.<br>
Certainly, various appropriate devices for sensing the<br>
geometry of a hand of an individual and for delivering<br>
a set of corresponding electrical signals which,<br>
digitized, may then be held in memory are already<br>
known.<br>
However, hitherto it has never been proposed to<br>
combine, successively and in order, a sensing of the<br>
geometry of a hand and a sensing of the fingerprints of<br>
at least one finger of at least one hand for the<br>
purposes of identifying an individual.<br>
The preselection of a group of persons on the basis of<br>
the geometry of the hand allows a considerable<br>
reduction in the exploratory domain within which the<br>
identification process based on fingerprint comparison<br>
will be undertaken. The process of comparing the<br>
geometry of a hand is a purely dimensional comparative<br>
process which can be carried out rapidly, and hence at<br>
less cost, even on a very sizeable population.<br>
Optionally, by way of variant which may lead to<br>
increased speed, it is possible to envisage that groups<br>
of substantially identical hand shapes are constructed<br>
previously in the file and that at the time of<br>
identification of a person, the group of hand shapes<br>
substantially identical to the shape of the hand of the<br>
person to be identified is queried directly.<br>
To fix matters, the equipment required by the<br>
implementation of the method in accordance with the<br>
invention may be reduced in a proportion from 10 to 1,<br>
or even from 2 0 to 1, as compared with the equipment to<br>
be envisaged in respect of identification solely<br>
through the sensing of fingerprints.<br>
It is also advantageously possible to envisage that,<br>
after selection of the group of hand shapes<br>
substantially identical to those of the person to be<br>
identified and before comparing the fingerprints of the<br>
finger of the person to be identified with those of the<br>
persons of the abovesaid selected group, an additional<br>
selection is performed on the basis of at least one<br>
other selection criterion, which advantageously is a<br>
biometric criterion, in particular for example on the<br>
criterion of sex and/or type.<br>
Thus, by virtue of the preselection performed according<br>
to the invention by sensing the geometry of a hand,<br>
optionally supplemented thereafter with additional<br>
preselections (according to sex which affords a<br>
halving, according to type, according to size, etc), it<br>
is eventually possible for the identification based on<br>
fingerprint comparison to pertain ultimately to only a<br>
small fraction of the population, it being possible to<br>
ensure this in a dependable, fast and economically<br>
acceptable manner.<br>
The invention will be better understood on reading the<br>
detailed .description which follows of certain preferred<br>
embodiments given merely by way of nonlimiting<br>
examples. In this description, reference will be made<br>
to the appended drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating the<br>
essential aspect of the method in accordance with the<br>
invention,<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic diagram illustrating a<br>
preferred embodiment of the method in accordance with<br>
the invention; and<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic diagram illustrating a<br>
variant implementation of a part of the methods of<br>
figures 1 and 2.<br>
The means proposed by the invention must make it<br>
possible, for the purpose of identifying a person<br>
belonging to a very numerous population, to discard a<br>
large fraction of said population (for example 70 to<br>
80% of the latter) before performing the procedure for<br>
identifying the person by comparing the fingerprints of<br>
at least one finger of at least one of his/her hands<br>
with the fingerprints stored in a central file<br>
accommodating all the identity data for the entire<br>
population.<br>
The invention proposes to perform this preselection by<br>
charting the shape (geometry) of at least one hand of<br>
the person, given that the shape of a hand can be<br>
identified by a given number (for example a dozen) of<br>
dimensional measurements taken at characteristic points<br>
of the hand (for example lengths of the fingers, widths<br>
of the fingers at certain joints, thickness of the<br>
hand, etc) which are suitable for giving a<br>
three-dimensional image of the hand. Numerous methods<br>
and apparatuses are known in this regard.<br>
Likewise, numerous methods and apparatuses are known<br>
which make it possible to chart the fingerprints of a<br>
finger, this sensing being performed in principle on<br>
one or more fingers of one hand or of both hands.<br>
In an initial assessment phase, all the identification<br>
data for each person of a population is placed in<br>
memory in a central file 1 (see fig. 1) , which<br>
identification data, in addition to the customary data<br>
(name, first name, etc), also encompass the<br>
fingerprints of at least one finger (index finger for<br>
example) of at least one hand (right hand for example)<br>
as well as the dimensional data relating to the<br>
geometry of at least one of the hands (right hand for<br>
example).<br>
Subsequently to check the identity of a person (police<br>
identity check, ballot, assessment, etc), physical<br>
identifying characteristics are sensed on the person,<br>
and especially his/her fingerprints (at 2) and the<br>
geometry of his/her hand (at 3) under the same<br>
conditions as during the initial assessment.<br>
In a first step we begin by processing the information<br>
of the geometry of the hand sensed on the person to be<br>
identified. For this purpose, by scrolling at 4 the<br>
hand geometry data held in the central file 1 for all<br>
the persons of the population, and by comparison at 5<br>
with those sensed on the person to be identified, a<br>
list of the group of persons of the population which<br>
possess a hand geometry substantially similar to that<br>
of the person to be identified is constructed at 6.<br>
As indicated above, the domain to be explored has thus<br>
been restricted within very sizeable proportions, while<br>
selection based on the geometry of the hand, which<br>
pertains only to dimensional comparisons, is easy and<br>
fast to process with the powerful computing means<br>
currently available.<br>
The method proceeds thereafter, while scrolling at 7<br>
the list of groups of persons selected at 6, by<br>
individual comparison at 8 of the fingerprints sensed<br>
at 2 on the person to be identified with those of each<br>
of the persons of the group selected at 6.<br>
The identification result for the person to be<br>
identified is finally obtained at 9.<br>
Under these conditions, involving a numerous population<br>
(for example that of a country) , the means proposed by<br>
the invention enable the complex and lengthy<br>
comparative identification via fingerprints to be made<br>
to pertain to a reduced group of persons and avoids the<br>
need to make it pertain to the entire population (which<br>
may for example reach several tens of millions of<br>
persons).<br>
It will also be noted that, although this is not the<br>
essential aim of the invention, the reliability of<br>
identification of the . person to be identified is<br>
incidentally increased on account of the fact that two<br>
identification criteria (geometry of the hand and<br>
fingerprints) are implemented rather than just one<br>
criterion (fingerprints). Certainly the degree of<br>
reliability of identification by fingerprints is very<br>
high. However, the identification which is carried out<br>
here is conducted computationally on the basis of the<br>
characteristics of the fingerprints: any risk of error<br>
due to the sensing of these characteristics and to the<br>
computerized processing may be compensated for through<br>
the implementation of the second selection criterion.<br>
Although in principle the method just set forth with<br>
regard to figure 1 leads to an implementational scheme<br>
which is economically acceptable in practice, it is<br>
however possible to push the preselection further on<br>
the basis of criteria which are very simple to process.<br>
For this purpose, criteria such as type, sex, etc may<br>
be invoked.<br>
By way of example, in figure 2, it has been assumed<br>
that the preselection based on the geometry of the hand<br>
of the person to be identified has been supplemented<br>
with the input of two additional data consisting of its<br>
type (at 10) and his/her sex (at 11).<br>
To this end, the type information, input at 10,<br>
relating to the person to be identified is compared at<br>
12 with the list (list 1) of the group of persons<br>
selected from the file 1 on the basis of the geometry<br>
of their hand scrolled at 7.<br>
This results in a second list (list 2) obtained at 13<br>
of the persons selected among the population based on<br>
the twofold criterion of geometry of the hand and type.<br>
The sex information, input at 11, relating to the<br>
person to be identified is thereafter compared at 15<br>
with the list 2 scrolled at 14.<br>
This then results in a third list (list 3) obtained at<br>
16 of the persons selected among the population based<br>
on the threefold criterion of geometry of the hand,<br>
type and sex.<br>
The fingerprint information can then be compared at 18<br>
with the list 3 scrolled at 17, leading at 19 to the<br>
identification of the person.<br>
The last comparison phase 18 then pertains only to a<br>
reduced number of persons, thereby rendering the<br>
comparative processing of the fingerprints executable<br>
with considerably reduced computer hardware (reduction<br>
by 10 or 20 for example).<br>
Here again, in addition to the speeding up of the<br>
identification processing and the reduction in<br>
investment in hardware, the multiplying of the<br>
preselection criteria preceding the identification by<br>
fingerprints, substantially increases the reliability of<br>
the method.<br>
By way of variant, in order to avoid the comparative<br>
processing of the geometry of the hand of the person to<br>
be identified from being performed by systematic<br>
comparison with the entire data of the population, it<br>
is possible to envisage, in order to save time, the<br>
creation, from the main file 1, of a secondary file 20<br>
in which groups bringing together each of the persons<br>
possessing substantially the same hand geometry have<br>
been created.<br>
In this case, as illustrated in .figure 3, on the basis<br>
of the hand geometry data charted at 3 on the person to<br>
be identified, the secondary file 20 is searched at 21<br>
for the corresponding dimensional group and it is then<br>
by scrolling at 22 of this preconstructed group alone<br>
that the previously envisaged comparison is performed<br>
at 5.<br>
Of course, numerous alterations may be made to the<br>
method set forth hereinabove without departing from the<br>
scope of the invention.<br>
