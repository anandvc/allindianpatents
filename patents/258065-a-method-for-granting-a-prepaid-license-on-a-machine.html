PREPAID LICENSING SYSTEM AND METHOD<br>
Field Of The Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention is generally related to a licensing system and method.<br>
Background Of the Invention<br>
[0002] Licensing, in terms of licensing software for example, can be offered in many different<br>
ways. These include but are not limited to restricted pay-per-use licenses and licenses without<br>
time restriction or without restriction on the number of uses. One problem with unlimited<br>
licenses is that many potential clients may avoid taking the license if the licensing fees for such a<br>
license, unrestricted by use or time, are too high. If the potential client could pay only for the<br>
uses of the license, which can hopefully be passed on to another party, then the potential client<br>
may become more interested in licensing the software.<br>
[0003] One way of licensing software on a pay-per-use basis is disclosed in U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,049,789. In such a system, however, each licensee makes contact with the licensor at regular<br>
intervals, to pay for each use of the license. Such periodic contact, however, is not always<br>
possible.<br>
[0004] Flexlm from Macrovision is another software licensing system. In this type of<br>
system, calls to the license system are spread over the parts of the code that needs to be licensed.<br>
Each call supplies the name of the licensed feature (e.g. FILMING, VIEWER,...) and a version<br>
as a parameter. The vendor also supplies a driver to retrieve machine identification safely and to<br>
provide this to the licensing system.<br>
[0005] The end user then installs a license file on his machine, that he purchased from the<br>
vendor. This file contains for each licensed feature information about name, expiration date, and<br>
an encrypted license key for example. The system checks the license file and the license is<br><br>
granted. If not, an error is returned. All such systems, however, involve a constant or periodic<br>
contact link with the vendor and/or do not involve pre-paid licenses.<br>
[0006] With such known licensing systems, contact with the licensor is necessary to pay for a<br>
number of uses, monitor uses, attribute particular licenses to particular machines, etc. This can<br>
be a problem, especially in the area of licensing software for machines, such as medical devices<br>
for example, wherein maintaining a constant or periodic contact link between the licensee and<br>
licensor is impossible or at least extremely difficult.<br>
[0007] Another way to pay for uses of a product, for example, can be found in the mobile<br>
communication field. Here, it is easy for the owner to make periodic contact with the purchaser.<br>
Pre-payment can occur by selling a prepaid card, wherein with each use, a contact to the owner is<br>
first made. While this is a way to pay for uses of a product, it is not readily applicable to<br>
software licenses.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0008] The present application, in one embodiment, is directed to development of a prepaid<br>
licensing method wherein periodic or constant contact with the licensor is not needed,. As such,<br>
such a method can be applied, for example, to licensing software pertaining, for example, to<br>
large machines including but not limited, medical devices (CT scanners, MRI devices, etc.).<br>
These large medical devices are often purchased, wherein software and updates are often<br>
available and desirable for licensing. Thus, Applicant has recognized a need, and has indeed<br>
developed a solution, for a type of pay-per-use method of licensing software, for example.<br>
[0009]	The method in one embodiment, may include storing a software option for licensing<br>
a number of prepaid uses of software for a machine. The software option can include unique and<br>
unchangeable information identifying the machine to be licensed, and information for measuring<br>
a number of uses of the machine. Based upon the stored information, a license for a number of<br>
prepaid uses of the software can be locally granted on the machine. As such, a number of uses of<br>
the software can be prepaid without periodic or constant contact and the pay-per-use licensing of<br><br>
the software for the machine can be easily. Further, the software license can be easily tied to a<br>
particular machine in a prepaid manner, and thus cheating on the license can be avoided.<br>
[0010] Further systems and methods of other embodiments have also been developed. In<br>
addition, a program in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention can cause a<br>
computer to execute the steps of the aforementioned method.<br>
[0011] For fuller understanding of the nature and advantages of the invention, reference<br>
should be made to the detailed description of exemplary embodiments taken in conjunction with<br>
the accompanying drawings. The detailed description provides only exemplary embodiments of<br>
the invention, and thus, the claims of the present invention should not be limited as such.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0020] In one embodiment, the present application is directed to a prepaid licensing method<br>
for licensing, for example, uses of software on a machine, such as software for use in a medical<br>
device for example. It should be noted that the machine, throughout the application, may be any<br>
device including some type of computer device and preferably including some type of memory,<br>
and is not in any way limited to medical devices. The method may include storing information,<br>
in the form of a software option, for example, for interacting with the software to be licensed on<br>
the machine to permit usage thereof. In should be understood, however, that the software and<br>
the software option can also be integrated and stored and used together as one.<br>
[0021] The user preferably identifies the software to be licensed, a desired number of uses of<br>
the software, the machine identifying information, and potentially a date of when he wants to use<br>
the licensed software. The user the pre-pays for these uses of the software. The user is then<br>
provided with information, preferably stored in a license.dat file, via a computer readable<br>
medium, a computer signal such as an email or Internet download for example, etc.<br>
[0022] The stored information is for licensing at least one use of software on a machine. The<br>
term software option is used throughout the application to mean some type of software for<br>
interacting with existing software to be licensed. The information, such as the software option<br>
for example, is preferably stored as a license.dat file, and includes unique and unchangeable<br>
information identifying the machine, and information for measuring a number of uses of the<br>
software on the machine.<br>
[0023] Thereafter, the user can install or copy the information (license.dat file, for example)<br>
onto the machine. The method is then able to locally grant a license on the machine for the<br>
number of prepaid uses of the software, based upon the stored information. This is done in a<br>
transparent manner to the user. As such, constant contact between a licensor and licensee is not<br><br>
necessary. A limited license for the number of prepaid uses of the software can thus be locally<br>
granted on the machine without the need for this remote or constant contact.<br>
[0024] Figure 1 of the present application indicates the methodology followed by an<br>
embodiment of the present application. In step S10, the method includes storing the information,<br>
such as a software option, for licensing at least one use of software on a machine. Thus, via the<br>
software option, an arrangement can be made wherein a licensee of the software can license a<br>
specific number of uses of the software on the machine. This can be important in software<br>
licenses for large medical devices, as one non-limiting example, wherein the medical device<br>
(machine) may already have been purchased, but software and its updates for the machine are<br>
continuously needed. A pay-per-use system or method of the present application permits the<br>
user with the ability to pre-pay for a license of a number of uses of the software, without needing<br>
to buy the software or without needing to continuously or periodically contact the licensor. This<br>
is done on a prepaid basis by prepaying for a number of uses of the software via the software<br>
option.<br>
[0025] The information stored in step S10 includes information identifying the particular<br>
machine that will use or license the software. Thus, the licensee of the software must identify a<br>
particular machine that will use the software (that will be granted a pay-per-use license for the<br>
software), and a unique and unchangeable information identifying the machine that will use the<br>
software can then be stored as part of the software option. By doing so, this helps the licensor to<br>
limit any potential cheating on the license, such as if the licensee attempted to utilize the<br>
software on another machine without having paid for another license.<br>
[0026] In addition, by utilizing unique and unchangeable information identifying the<br>
machine, constant or periodic contact with the licensor is, again, not necessary. Such unique and<br>
unchangeable information identifying the machine can be, for example, some type of machine<br>
identification code which uniquely identifies that particular machine. Other examples of such<br>
unique and unchangeable information identifying the machine can be a dongle attached to the<br>
machine (dongle ID), an Ethernet board address (MAC address) of the machine which is unique<br><br>
in the world, a CPU serial number, or any other mechanism which allows both the licensee and<br>
licensor to identify the machine that will be licensed to use the software.<br>
[0027] The information stored in step S10 further includes information for measuring a<br>
number of uses of the software on the machine. As such, the licensee is able to license a desired<br>
number of uses and is able to prepay for such desired number of uses of the software on the<br>
machine. By storing information for measuring a number of uses of the software on the<br>
machine, the method provides the ability to both pre-pay for a number of uses and monitor the<br>
number of uses and to make sure that the number of uses does not exceed the prepaid number.<br>
[0028] Finally, in step S20, the method includes granting a license for the number of prepaid<br>
uses of the software on the machine, based upon the stored information. Thus, if the information<br>
pertaining to a license for a number of prepaid uses of the software is stored on an identified<br>
machine, a license can be locally granted for a number of prepaid uses of the software on that<br>
identified machine, without the need to continuously contact the licensor. The unique and<br>
unchangeable information identifies the machine to use the licensed software, and a number of<br>
prepaid uses of the software can adequately be measured.<br>
[0029] In the method as shown in Figure 1, the number of prepaid uses can be monitored or<br>
counted. As such, use of the software on the machine can be prohibited upon the count reaching<br>
zero. At that time, the licensee can then have the option to go back to the licensor, obtain a new<br>
prepaid license agreement for use of the software on the same machine (or for different software<br>
and/or a different machine), and can purchase any number of uses of the software in a prepaid<br>
fashion.<br>
[0030] A determination can be made during start-up, shut-down, or operation of the machine<br>
to check on the validity of the software license; namely to determine whether or not the software<br>
license is for the correct machine and whether or not at least one prepaid use of the software<br>
remains. Accordingly, during start-up, before the machine is actually started and/or before the<br>
software is actually run, the methodology set forth in Figure 1 can take place. Alternatively, this<br><br>
can be monitored during operation of the machine, or can occur as the machine is being shut<br>
down.<br>
[0031] Further, during the shut-down operation for example, if the last of a number of prepaid<br>
uses of the software is being used by the machine, an indication of the expiration or termination<br>
of the prepaid license can be conveyed via some type of indication. Such an indication can be<br>
audible or visual, for example, via a warning light, warning buzzer, display, etc. Indeed, during<br>
any phase of start-up, shut-down, or operation of the machine or of the use of the software, the<br>
number of uses of the software remaining on the prepaid license can be determined in any<br>
manner, and indicated on the machine in any way.<br>
[0032] In addition, in an another embodiment, a threshold can be determined, wherein upon a<br>
number of uses remaining actually reaching the threshold, some indication can be conveyed on<br>
the machine, either audibly or visually for example. This can act as a type of warning for a user<br>
of the machine, indicating that the software license needs to be renewed.<br>
[0033] In a further embodiment, it should be noted that at least a portion of the stored<br>
information may be encrypted. The encrypted items can include, but are not limited to, the<br>
software to be licensed itself, the entire software option, the number of prepaid uses, the unique<br>
and unchangeable information identifying the machine to be licensed to use the software,<br>
information for measuring the number of uses, etc. The encryption may be used to protect any<br>
unauthorized change of any information that could result in the granting of a license that was not<br>
paid for. Indeed, all or a portion of any of the stored information may be encrypted.<br>
[0034] In addition, the software option itself may be sent via any media and may be sent<br>
and/or used in conjunction with any software used on or with the machine. Thus, the software<br>
option can be incorporated into any software for use on a machine, such as a medical device for<br>
example, and/or can merely be stored and used in conjunction with existing software to ensure<br>
that the existing software is licensed in a prepaid and secure manner. Further, the license may<br>
additionally be tied to some point of time, such as start-up, operation, or shut-down on the<br>
machine, and the stored information pertaining to the license may include some indication of<br><br>
date or time of the last change in the agreement, to even further enhance security and avoid<br>
cheating on the license.<br>
[0035] The licensing method of the present application is a unique type of prepaid licensing<br>
method for a prepaid number of uses of any type of licensable software, which is uniquely tied to<br>
a particular machine. As validity of the license can be checked during start-up, operation, or<br>
shut-down, cheating of the license agreement can be limited and hopefully even avoided. In one<br>
further embodiment of the present application, cheating can further be avoided as follows.<br>
[0036] The stored information can include, as part of a file of the licensed software and/or the<br>
software option, a "checksum". The checksum can be used for checking various features, such<br>
as any changing of the system date. If the system date has been changed, cheating can be<br>
recognized, and the number of uses of the software can be reduced, by one for example. Further,<br>
the method may include a check to make sure that the licensed software is not taken or copied<br>
from one machine, and used on another machine. Further checks can include checking for<br>
changes of any values in the stored software and/or software option and/or related file, and<br>
checking for any attempts to replace the stored software and/or software option after use of the<br>
software, with a file before use. Again, for any found violation, a penalty of, for example, on<br>
use, may be enforced.<br>
[0037] Regarding any change in values in the stored software and/or software option and/or<br>
related file, the license file can include a checksum and can potentially be encrypted. Any<br>
change will change the encrypted checksum and thus, can be detected as potential cheat.<br>
Regarding the attempt to replace a license file, this can be detected by a next check against the<br>
main memory of the system or machine, for example, during use or shut-down for example.<br>
[0038] Finally, a check can be made to determine if there is an attempt to replace the stored<br>
software and/or software option and/or related file after use, with the stored software and/or<br>
software option and/or related file before use. This can be done, for example, while the system<br>
or machine is in shut-down and/or when no main memory remains. At this time, this can be<br>
detected by use of a time-stamp comparison during start-up, for example.<br><br>
[0039] In one preferred embodiment, at least the software option pertaining to a license is<br>
stored for a number of prepaid uses of the software on a machine, and a license check or<br>
validation can occur at each start-up of the machine, for example, and/or at each start up of use<br>
of the software. An account file or registration entry can optionally be written in for each use<br>
and/or can be written in during each shut-down of the machine, for example.<br>
[0040] As long as the number of uses remaining for the pre-paid license is greater than zero,<br>
the account details of the software license (the license.dat file, for example) are stored in a main<br>
memory of the machine, as well as in an account file registration for example, to permit<br>
controlling of misuse or cheating. For each use, the following, for example, may be entered into<br>
a stored file: date, time of day, identity of the computer device that is used. During each shut-<br>
down, the following data, for example, may be entered: date, time of day, identity of computer,<br>
event: shut-down. As such, this information can be used to monitor any possible misuse.<br>
Finally, if during the start-up of the computer device, the shut-down operation is not discovered<br>
as a last entry in the account file, a unit may be removed from the account to reduce the number<br>
of uses and to avoid any risk of misuse of the license and/or software.<br>
[0041] Again, as previously discussed, this type of methodology for use of a software<br>
licensing option of the present application may be used in conjunction with any type of<br>
licensable software, including, but not limited to, software for medical devices or machines. By<br>
acquiring a license in the manner of the method of an embodiment of the present application, a<br>
licensee can acquire, ahead of time, a number of prepaid uses for any type of software.<br>
[0042] In another embodiment, following pre-payment, the licensee may be provided with<br>
information similar to a type of license key (a license.dat file for example, carried by some type<br>
of signal sent via e-mail, over the Internet, or other electronic carrier), wherein in this<br>
information can include information pertaining to the software and the licensing of the software<br>
based on the pre-paid usage. This information can include the unique and unchangeable<br>
information identifying a particular machine on which the software to be licensed is to be run.<br>
This unique and unchangeable information can include a dongle ID, an ethernet MAC address, a<br><br>
CPU serial number, etc. The information further includes information relating to the number of<br>
uses involved in the prepayment, and can include information identifying a licensing packet or<br>
software to be used or licensed and/or, etc. It may further include other information such as an<br>
entry date, etc. This licensing key information may thus be in the form of a computer data<br>
signal, which may further be encrypted, and which is provided via some medium such as email,<br>
the internet, etc., upon receiving payment by the licensor. The key information may then be<br>
entered into a machine, for example, for use in conjunction with software to be licensed on the<br>
machine, so that the machine, in essence, will now carry units for use of the software during an<br>
active term and will store the current number of pre-paid uses of the software in its memory, for<br>
example. To protect against manipulations, the information may be encrypted.<br>
[0043] As shown in Figure 2 of the present application, another embodiment of the present<br>
application involves a method for granting a prepaid software license on a machine or other<br>
configured device. This method can include step SI00 of examining information for licensing<br>
prepaid use of software on a designated machine. This includes examining information<br>
pertaining to a number of prepaid uses of the software on a designated machine.This<br>
information can further be a type of software option, and can include unique and unchangeable<br>
information identifying the designated machine to use the software being licensed.<br>
[0044] In a further embodiment, the step of the examining information may include reading<br>
license file contents, such as last usage, date/time; reading license files regarding modification of<br>
date/time; reading files of shut-down dates/times, reading start-up dates/times, and/or reading<br>
current date/time, etc.<br>
[0045] In step S200 as shown in Fig. 2, the method includes comparing machine<br>
identification information. This can include comparing information identifying the machine on<br>
which the software is to be used, to the unique and unchangeable information identifying the<br>
designated machine on which the licensed software is to be run. Subsequent to this step, or even<br>
prior to that of step S200, in step S300, a number of uses of the software on the machine is<br>
determined and the number of uses is compared to the number of prepaid uses. Finally, in step<br><br>
S400, the license is granted on the designated machine for any remaining uses. This includes<br>
granting a license for use of the software, upon the information identifying the machine matching<br>
the unique and unchangeable information identifying the designated machine, and upon the<br>
number of uses being determined to be less than the number of prepaid uses. Accordingly, as<br>
long as the machine using the license corresponds to the designated machine, and as long as at<br>
least one prepaid use remains, then the license is granted.<br>
[0046] As stated above, in one embodiment the information, in the form of the license.dat file<br>
for example, pertaining to the license can include a last usage date/time and a modification<br>
date/time. In an effort to further avoid cheating the licensor out of licensing fees, when shut-<br>
down, start-up, and/or current date/time are read, a cheat may have occurred if the last shut-down<br>
date/time is less than the last usage date/time, the last modification date/time, the start-up<br>
date/time, and the current date/time. If so, then by checking these various aspects, a cheat can be<br>
detected, and one use (for example) can be removed from the number of prepaid uses of the<br>
software license. This can be checked during start-up of the machine to determine attempts to<br>
cheat the licensor, for example.<br>
[0047] Figure 3 is an illustration of an embodiment of the present application, including a<br>
machine 8, such as a type of medical device for example. The machine 8 can include, there<br>
within, a prepaid licensing system. The prepaid licensing system can include a storage medium<br>
4 (which may include the software option, for example), and a device 6. The device 6 is adapted<br>
to locally grant a license for the number of prepaid uses of the software on the machine, based<br>
upon information stored in the storage medium 4. The storage medium 4 can include at least the<br>
software option, and can further include the software to be licensed (wherein the two may also be<br>
integrated). It can further include, as part of the software option for example, a unique and<br>
unchangeable information identifying the machine to use the licensed software. Finally, it can<br>
include information for measuring a number of uses of the software by the machine.<br>
[0048] The device 6 may be further adapted to count a number of uses of the software by<br>
machine, and be adapted to prohibit operation of the machine upon the count reaching zero.<br><br>
Further, it can be adapted to check on the validity of the software license, in any of the ways<br>
previously listed. This can occur, for example, during at least one of start-up, shut-down, and<br>
operation of the machine. Specifically, in one embodiment, the device 6 is used to compare the<br>
unique and unchangeable information identifying the machine as stored in the storage medium 4,<br>
to actual information identifying the machine 8 to be operated. This actual information may be<br>
stored in a separate main memory 10 of the machine, or in any other location within the machine.<br>
If the comparison does not match, the device 6 will prohibit operation of the machine 8 with<br>
respect to the license.<br>
[0049] Similar to the embodiments stated before, at least a portion of the information stored<br>
in the storage medium may be encrypted. The machine 8 may further be a medical device. The<br>
machine 8 itself may include the entire prepaid licensing system 2, or a portion thereof. It<br>
preferably stores the software option in any type of memory within the machine, and then uses<br>
its own existing computer device to interact with the software option to license the uses of the<br>
software. Thus, as shown in Fig. 3, the prepaid licensing system 2 may actual be the machine 8,<br>
stored with the software option. The machine 8 may further optionally include some type of<br>
indication device 12, such as a visual and/or audible indicator, for indicating that a number of<br>
uses is reached and/or that a threshold is reached and/or the number of uses has run out.<br>
[0050] Figures 4-6, merely illustrate various aspects of machine or software operation<br>
wherein validity of the license may be checked. For example, as shown in Figure 4, validity of<br>
the software license may be checked during start-up, by comparing the information, such as the<br>
software option in the form of a license.dat file for example, stored in storage medium 4 to<br>
information stored in main memory 10 of the machine 8, including actual information identifying<br>
the machine to be operated with the licensed software. The date/time of installation of the<br>
license.dat file can be checked, against the date/time of allowable first use of the license (if such<br>
information is included in the license.dat file). For example, the date/time of installation of the<br>
license.dat file must be at least a one millisecond before the date/time of allowable first use of<br>
the license to permit operation thereof. The information, once installed into storage medium 4, is<br><br>
preferably read and stored in main memory 10 of the machine 8 and the start-up steps are<br>
checked thereafter (date/time of allowable first use, machine ID, etc.).<br>
[0051] Similarly, validity of the software license can be checked in comparison to<br>
information stored in main memory 10 of the machine 8, during use of the machine as shown in<br>
Fig. 5 and/or during shutdown as shown in Fig. 6. The stored information can be checked and<br>
compared (between storage medium 4 and main memory 10) to see if it is unchanged as shown<br>
in Fig. 5. Details of the current use can be added and stored, for example. This added<br>
information can then be written back from the main memory 10 into the storage medium 4 as<br>
shown in Fig. 5, and can be checked to ensure that it is unchanged and/or to count down a usage.<br>
Finally, during shut-down, validity of the software license can be checked by comparing<br>
information in the storage medium 4 to that of the main memory 10 of the machine 8, usage can<br>
be counted down, and information can be stored for comparison at start-up. Note that usage can<br>
be counted down during any of start-up, shut-down, and operation.<br>
[0052] Finally, the methodology of any of the above-mentioned embodiments of the present<br>
application can be embodied in a computer signal as stated above, or on a computer-readable<br>
medium 100 as shown in Fig. 7. The computer-readable medium 100 is shown in Fig. 7 as being<br>
operable in cooperation with a machine 110, such as a medical device or any other machine<br>
adapted to use the software being licensed. The machine 110 is the same as the machine 8<br>
described previously and can include any of the components thereof, such as those shown and<br>
described in Fig. 3.<br>
[0053] The computer-readable medium 100 can include a first code segment including at least<br>
a software option for licensing at least one use of software on a machine. This software option<br>
can include unique and unchangeable information identifying the machine and information for<br>
measuring a number of uses of the software on the machine 110. Further, the computer-readable<br>
medium 100 can include a second code segment, adapted to cause a computer device to locally<br>
grant a license for the number of prepaid uses of the software on the machine 110 based upon the<br><br>
information stored in the first code segment. Additional aspects of any of the methodology as<br>
discussed above can also be embodied on this computer-readable medium 100.<br>
[0054] The computer readable medium 100 may be a built-in medium installed inside a main<br>
body of a computer device or machine 110, or a removable medium arranged so that it can be<br>
separated from the main body of a computer device or machine 110. Examples of a built-in<br>
medium can include, but are not limited to, rewritable involatile memories such as ROMs and<br>
Flash memories in hard disks, etc. Examples of the removable medium can include, but are not<br>
limited to, optical storage media such as CD-ROMs and DVDs for example; magneto-optical<br>
storage media such as MOs for example; magnetism storage media such as floppy disks, cassette<br>
tapes, and removable hard disks for example; media with a built-in rewritable involatile memory,<br>
such as memory cards for example; and media with a built-in ROM, such as ROM cassettes for<br>
example.<br>
[0055] The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in<br>
many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the<br>
invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to<br>
be included within the scope of the following claims.<br><br>
