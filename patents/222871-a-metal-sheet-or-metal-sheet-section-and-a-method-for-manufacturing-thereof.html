				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a lubricant-coated metal sheet or a section thereof<br>
having improved forming properties, whereby the lubricant is in particular a<br>
corrosion protection oil, pre-lube and/or dry lube. The invention further relates to<br>
a method for the manufacture of such a metal sheet or metal section as well as<br>
to its use for the manufacture of metal bodies by forming in particular by deep-<br>
drawing.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the manufacture of metal sheets, such as steel sheets, it is common for these<br>
to be provided with a temporary corrosion protection for storage and transport<br>
immediately after the manufacturing or coating process and before delivery to<br>
the metal-processing industry. This is usually effected by applying a corrosion-<br>
inhibiting lubricant directly before the coiling of the sheet, such as a corrosion<br>
protection oil, a pre-lube or a dry-lube. If the metal sheet is destined for further<br>
processing by forming such as deep-drawing, the lubricants used can contain, in<br>
addition to corrosion-inhibiting substances, other ancillary substances, especially<br>
matched to the individual forming process, which improve the tribological<br>
properties of the sheet during the forming process. Metal sheets coated in this<br>
way are encountered, for example, in the automobile industry in the<br>
manufacture of bodywork made of metal sheets by deep-drawing.<br>
With the use of lubricants for temporary corrosion protection and for improving<br>
the forming properties, it must be particularly borne in mind that these are to be<br>
easily and completely removable the forming process.<br>
Form EP 0 499 105 Bl a method is known for the cold deep-drawing of metal<br>
sheets, in which the sheet which is to be deep-drawn and/or the deep-drawing<br>
tool are treated with an aqueous solution of an inorganic alkali phosphate and<br>
are then deep-drawn in the presence of a deep-drawing oil. The slat which is<br>
deposited on the sheet forms a soap under the pressure and temperature<br>
conditions of the deep-drawing process as a result of the reaction with the deep-<br>
drawing oil, which has the effect of reducing the friction coefficient. A<br>
disadvantage of the method is that the alkali phosphate used and the soap which<br>
is formed cannot be entirely moved from the sheet, free of any residue, after the<br>
deep-drawing.<br>
From CH 441 594 a lubricant composition is further known for the cold-forming<br>
of metals without the removal of material, which contains a finely dispersed<br>
water-soluble inorganic salt for the improvement of the tribological properties,<br>
such as Borax. A disadvantage with this lubricant composition is that its<br>
lubrication capacity is not constant, since the salt is not distributed uniformly<br>
over the surface, which interferes with the deep-drawing process.<br>
With the producing of single-sided electrolytically galvanized fine sheet, verv<br>
their phosphating or borax passivation with a coating weight of approx.<br>
10mg/m2 has proved advantageous in respect of tribological properties. Both<br>
products cam be applied in the existing flushing baths of the galvanizing lines,<br>
but they have the disadvantage that they may impair the phosphating process in<br>
the automobile producing plant.<br>
The use of prelubes takes account of the idea of influencing the tribological<br>
properties of steel strip directly on the surface of the steel. Prelubes contain<br>
drawing aids which are introduced into the oil coating, which is about 1 Âµm thick.<br>
Only the direct steel-tool interface is tribologically active, in the range of a few<br>
nanometers.<br>
Finally, the principle is generally known of carrying out a surface treatment of<br>
the deep-drawn sheet in order to improve the tribological properties. In<br>
particular, chemical processes for the surface treatment are known, such as<br>
phosphating, by means of which the friction coefficient between the sheet and<br>
the tool is reduced, and the forming of the sheet section is thereby facilitated.<br>
Such a treatment, however is expensive and cannot be applied to all deep-drawn<br>
sheets.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a lubricant-coated metal sheet<br>
for the manufacture of metal bodies by forming, with improved tribological<br>
properties. The metal sheet should be easy to clean after the forming process<br>
and without any residues remaining. Finally, the manufacture of the lubricant<br>
coated metal sheet should be capable of being carried out easily and without<br>
high investment expenditure in existing manufacturing facilities.<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose an aqueous solution of the<br>
treatment of metal surfaces containing an organic phosphoric acid ester and a<br>
water-soluble organic sulphur compound and/or organic molybdenum compound,<br>
all compounds as describes hereto, as well as a concentrate for the production of<br>
such a solution.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by a metal sheet or a metal<br>
sheet section comprising a coating of lubricant, in particular a corrosion<br>
protection oil, pre-lube and/or dry-lube, whereby the metal sheet or the metal<br>
sheet section comprises a layer which is formed by the application of a solution<br>
containing an organic phosphoric acid ester onto the metallic surface of the<br>
sheet.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that the lubricant-coated metal sheets according<br>
to the invention have excellent tribological properties as a consequence of their<br>
layer formed by the phosphoric acid ester. By contrast with lubricant-coated<br>
metal sheets without such a layer, the metal sheets according to the invention<br>
have a reduced friction coefficient. Finally, the metal sheets according to the<br>
invention can be easily cleaned after the forming process by existing degreasing<br>
systems, whereby both the layer containing the lubricant as well as the layer<br>
formed by the phosphoric acid ester can be removed from the surface of the<br>
sheet with no problem at all and without leaving any residue.<br>
The metal sheets which are capable of being used according to the invention can<br>
be any desired metal sheets from which metal bodies can be manufactured by<br>
forming, in particulars by cold forming. Particularly suitable metal sheets are<br>
steel sheets. The metal sheets which can be used according to the invention can<br>
be coated or uncoated. As an uncoated metal sheet, for example, consideration<br>
can be given to uncoated fine sheet metal, in particular conti-annealed uncoated<br>
fine sheet metal. As a coated metal sheet, consideration can be given in<br>
particular to electolytically coated sheet, as well as to hot-dip galvanized of<br>
galvanized sheets. The metal sheets preferably have a thickness of 0.05 to 5mm,<br>
an in particular from 0.5 to 1.5 mm.<br>
The metal sheets and metal sheet sections according to the invention are coated<br>
with a lubricant which is intended to protect the sheets after manufacture, at<br>
least temporally against undesirably environmental influences, and in particular<br>
against corrosion manifestations. The choice of lubricant is not restricted; on the<br>
contrary, any substances containing grease or oil or the like, as well as do<br>
lubricants such as graphite, come into consideration. The lubricants which can be<br>
used according to the invention preferably contain corrosion inhibitors. In<br>
addition, the lubricant can also contain further additives, in particular additives<br>
for improving the drawing properties of the sheets.<br>
Such lubricants for the metal working industry are in general known to the<br>
person skilled in the art, and are described, for example, in Nachtmann,<br>
"Lubricants and lubrication in metalworking operations", Marcel Decker, New<br>
York, 1985, pages 81 to 105; Byers, "Metalworking fluids", Marcel Decker, New<br>
York, 1994, pages 135 to 140, and Mortier, Orszulik, "Chemistry and Technology<br>
of Lubricants", 2nd edition, Chapman &amp; Hall, London, 1997, pages 253 to 260.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, a corrosion protection oil<br>
is used as the lubricant. Such corrosion protection oils are generally known to the<br>
person skilled in the art, and usually contain a basic oil with an aromate content<br>
addition, the corrosion protection oils can also contain anti-oxidants for the<br>
prevention of oil aging, as well as thixotropy forming agents for reducing drip<br>
losses with oiled sheets.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention, a so-called "pre-<br>
lube" is used as a lubricant. Pre-lubes are corrosion protection oils with improved<br>
drawing properties, and as such are generally known to the person skilled in the<br>
art. The improvements of the drawing properties is achieved by the addition of<br>
further additives, e.g. of esters.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention, a so-called "dry<br>
lubricant" is used as a lubricant. Dry lubricants are thin films on wax and/or<br>
acrylate bases, with similar properties to pre-lubes, and as such as generally<br>
known to the person skilled in the art. In addition to this, dry lubricants also offer<br>
the possibility of manufacturing difficult drawing components in pressing plants<br>
without further additional lubrication. Drip losses from coated sheets are avoided<br>
entirely. Dry lubricants can be applied after smelting, for example by elecrtostatic<br>
means or be means of roll coaters.<br>
According to the invention, a layer is formed on the metallic surface of the sheet,<br>
which can be obtained by the application of an organic phosphoric acid ester<br>
onto the metallic surface of the sheet.<br>
Organic phosphoric acid esters which can be used according to the invention are,<br>
in particular, combinations of the general formula<br>
where X represents hydrogen, Na, K, -NH2, -NHR, -NR2, - NH (R' -OH), -N(R' -<br>
OH)2, or -NR(R' -OH), R represents a straight- chain or branched alkyl group<br>
with 1 to 14 carbon atoms, in particular 1 to 8, R' is a straight-chain or branched<br>
alkyl group with 1 to 14 carbon atoms, in particular 1 to 8, whereby one or more<br>
hydrogen atoms in R and R' can be substituted by a polymer or oligomer group -<br>
Y-R, where Y represents (CH2-CH2-O)m or CH2-CH (CH3) -O-)m with m = 1 to<br>
infinity, and, in particular, m = 1 to 10, R and R' can in each case be equal or<br>
different, and n is a number from 0 to 3, with the proviso that n is not 0 if X<br>
stands exclusively for hydrogen.<br>
Particularly good results are achieved if, as an organic phosphoric acid ester, a<br>
combination of the formula given above is used, with X = H, R = C4H9 and n = 1<br>
or 2. Particularly preferred, in addition, is an equimolar mixture of (C4H9-O) PO<br>
(OH)2 and (OH) PO (O-C4H9)2.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the layer formed by the<br>
phosphoric acid ester contains, as further components, a water-soluble organic<br>
sulphur compound and/or an organic molybdenum compound.<br>
Suitable organic sulphur compounds according to the invention are, in particular,<br>
thiadiazoles, dithiocarbamates, and/or dithiopropionates, as well as their salts<br>
and derivatives.<br>
Especially suitable organic sulphur compounds are, for example, sodium-2-<br>
mercaptobenzothiazole, 2, 5-dimercapto-l,3,4-thiadiazole, as well as salts and<br>
derivatives thereof sodium dimethyl dithiocarbamate, potassium dimethyul<br>
dithiocarbamate, and/or monoethanol amine dithiopropionate.<br>
Organic molvbdenum compounds which are suitable according to the invention<br>
can be obtained, for example, by the conversion of molybdenum trioxide and/or<br>
molybdeneic acid with an amine and/or alkanolamine.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the layer<br>
containing the phosphoric acid ester contains, as a further component, as least<br>
one inorganic compound from the group consisting of polyphosphates, borates,<br>
molybdates, and wolframates.<br>
Inorganic compounds which are especially well-suited according to the invention<br>
are, for example, ammonium tripolyphosphate, sodium tetraborate, ammonium<br>
molybdate, sodium wolframate, potassium wolframate, and/or sodium<br>
wolframate.<br>
Preferably, the organic phosphoric acid ester and any further components are<br>
applied onto the metal sheet in the form of an aqueous solution. After the<br>
application, the metal sheet is preferably dried.<br>
The layer formed by phosphoric acid ester can be formed in any desireJ<br>
thickness. Preferably, however, this is a thin layer, in particular a coating in the<br>
nanometer range.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention, a layer containing<br>
a lubricant is formed directly onto a layer formed by phosphoric acid ester. The<br>
layer containing lubricant contains preferably a corrosion protection oil, pre-lube,<br>
and/or dry-lube. Preferably, the layer containing lubricant contains a corrosion<br>
protection oil.<br>
The layer containing lubricant can be formed in any desired thicknesses.<br>
Particularly good tribological properties can be achieved it the layer containing<br>
lubricant is formed in a thickness of 0.3 to 3.0 g/m2, in particular 1 to 2 g/m2.<br>
It has proved to be particularly advantageous if the layer containing lubricant is<br>
matched to the layer containing phosphoric acid ester in such a way that it<br>
contains components which are contained in the layer containing phosphoric acid<br>
ester.<br>
It has been found that a synergistic effect can be incurred by this measure, and<br>
the tribological properties of the sheet are improved still further.<br>
It is therefore advantageous if the layer containing lubricant contains at least on*<br>
organic phosphoric acid ester as defined above, in a quantity from 0.01 to 50 %<br>
by weight, and in particular 0.05 to 10 % by weight.<br>
It is further advantageous if the layer containing lubricant contains an aqueous<br>
organic sulphur compound as defined above, in a quantity form 0.005 to 50 %<br>
by weight, in particular 0.01 to 30 % by weight, and/or an organic molybdenum<br>
compound as defined above in a quantity from 0.005 to 50 % by weight, in<br>
particular 0.01 to 30 % by weight.<br>
Finally, it is advantageous if the layer containing lubricant contains an inorganic<br>
compound as defined above in a quantity from 0.005 to 50 % by weight, in<br>
particular 0.01 to 30 % by weight.<br>
The invention further relates to a method for the manufacture of the metal sheet<br>
according to the invention or metal sheet according to the invention or met~l<br>
sheet sections, comprising the following steps:<br>
Application of a solution containing an organic phosphoric acid ester on<br>
the upper and/or lower side of the sheet, and<br>
Application of a lubricant onto the sheet coated in this way<br>
The application of the solution containing the organic phosphoric acid ester can<br>
be effected by any desired measures known to the person skilled in the art, such<br>
as immersion, spraying, brushing, or roll coating.<br>
The procedure can be conveniently integrated into the existing work acquences<br>
in the manufacturing of metal sheets. Accordingly, the application of the solution<br>
containing the phosphoric acid ester can be effected, for example, during the<br>
coating of the sheet in the flushing bath of a system or during the cooling of the<br>
sheet in the bath of water cooling system. Preferably, the solution containing the<br>
phosphoric acid ester can be effected in the flushing bath of a coating system.<br>
The flushing is to this situation is preferably arranged downstream as single-step<br>
no-rinse post-treatment of the metallic coating process (e.g. electrolytic<br>
galvanizing). Within a production system, further production steps can be<br>
arranged downstream of the flushing bath. In particular, the metal sheet can be<br>
dried after the flushing bath in suitable drier and/or coated subsequently with a<br>
lubricant (E.g. by electrostatic oiling)<br>
The solution containing phosphoric acid ester is preferably applied as an aqueous<br>
solution.<br>
The solution contains the phosphoric acid ester preferably in a quantity from 0.1<br>
to 15 % by weight, and in particular 3 to 8 % by weight.<br>
The pH of the solution is adjusted preferably to a value of 6.5 to 11, in particular<br>
7.5 to 9.5.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the solution contains as<br>
further components, as described above, a water-soluble organic sulphur<br>
compound, in particular one of the compounds described heretofore, and/or an<br>
organic molybdenum compound, in particular one of the compounds described<br>
heretofore, and/or one of the inorganic compounds described heretofore. The<br>
water-soluble organic sulphur compound(s) and/or organic molybdenum<br>
compounds are contained in the solution preferably in a quantity from 1 to 50 %<br>
by weight, in particular from 5 to 25 % by weight. Related to the quantity of<br>
phosphoric acid ester.<br>
The inorganic compound(s) are contained in the solution in a quantity from 1 to<br>
50 % by weight, in particular from 5 to 10 % by weight, related to the quantity<br>
of phosphoric acid ester.<br>
Before the application of the lubricant it is advantageous for the sheet to be<br>
dried.<br>
As a lubricant, preferably a corrosion protection oil, pre-lube and/or dry-lube is<br>
used, as described heretofore. Preferably, the lubricant is matched to the<br>
solution containing the phosphoric acid ester to such an extent that it contains<br>
components as described heretofore (e.g. organic phosphoric acid ester, water-<br>
soluble organic sulphur compound, organic molybdenum compound, and / or<br>
inorganic compound, which are also contained in the solution containing the<br>
phosphoric acid ester.<br>
The lubricant is applied preferably in a quantity from 0.3 to 3 g/m4, in particular<br>
1 to 2 g/m2.<br>
The invention accordingly also comprises the use of a solution containing an<br>
organic phosphoric acid ester as described heretofore for the treatment of metal<br>
surfaces.<br>
Finally, the use of the metal sheet or metal sheet section according to the<br>
invention comprises the manufacture of metal bodies by forming, in particular by<br>
deep-drawing.<br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is described in greater detail hereinafter on the basis of an<br>
embodiment.<br>
Electrolytically galvanized steel sheets of a thickness of 1 mm were treated by<br>
immersion in an aqueous solution of the composition described heretofore, dried,<br>
and then coated with 1.5 g/m2 pre-lube. To match the drawing performance, the<br>
friction coefficient was then determined in the draw-bed test. As a reference for<br>
the friction coefficient &amp; sample of the electrolytically galvanized steel sheet was<br>
used, which was not treated with an aqueous solution. The friction coefficient of<br>
this reference sample was set at 100%.<br>
Example 1<br>
An electrolytically galvanized steel sheet was treated with a 5% solution of an<br>
equimolar phosphoric acid ester mixture of (CH3-O) PO (OH)2 and (OH) PO(O-<br>
CH3)2. The sheet was dried and then coated with 1.5 g/m2 pre-lube. The friction<br>
coefficient was 88%.<br>
A reduction in the friction coefficient of 12 % was determined in comparison with<br>
the reference sample without pre-treatment.<br>
Example 2<br>
An electrolytically galvanized steel was treated with a 5% solution of an<br>
equimolar phosphoric acid ester mixture of (CH3-O) PO (OH)2 and (OH) PO (0-<br>
C4H9)2. The sheet was dried and then coated with 1.5 g/m2 pre-lube. The friction<br>
coefficient was 58%.<br>
A reduction in the friction coefficient of 42 % was determined in comparison with<br>
the reference sample without pre-treatment.<br>
Example 3<br>
An electrolytically galvanized steel sheet was treated with a 5% solution of an<br>
equimolar phosphoric acid ester mixture of (C8H17-O) PO (OH)2 and (OH) PO (0-<br>
C8H17)2. The sheet was dried and then coated with 1.5 g/m2 pre-lube. The<br>
friction coefficient was 90%.<br>
A reduction in the friction coefficient of 10% was determined in comparison with<br>
the reference sample without pre-treatment.<br>
Example 4<br>
An electrolytically galvanized steel sheet was treated with a 55 solution of an<br>
equimolar phosphoric acid ester mixture of CH2 - (O-CH2-CH2)3 - C12H24-O) PO<br>
(OH)2 and (HO) PO (CH3 - [O-CH2CH2]3 - C12H24- O)2. The sheet was dried and<br>
then coated with 1.5 g/m2 pre-lube. The friction coefficient was 92%.<br>
A reduction in the friction coefficient of 8% was determined in comparison with<br>
the reference sample without pre-treatment.<br>
Example 5<br>
In this example, the deep-drawing working range of an electrolytically galvanized<br>
fine steel sheet manufactured in accordance with Example 2 was examined in<br>
relation to the reference sample without pre-treatment. The results of this<br>
examination are presented in Fig. 1.<br>
The results show that the fine sheet coated according to the invention (Fig. lb)<br>
has a perceptibly greater deep-drawing working range than the reference sample<br>
without pre-treatment (Fig. la).<br>
Comparison example 1<br>
An electrolytically calvanized steel sheet was treated with a 5% sodium<br>
tetraborate solution dried, and then coated with 1.5 g/m2 pre-lube. The friction<br>
coefficient was 90%.<br>
A reduction in the friction coefficient of 10% was determined in comparison with<br>
the reference sample without pre-treatment.<br>
The results show that the metal sheets according to the invention which were<br>
treated with a phosphoric acid ester solution have perceptibly improved<br>
tribological properties in comparison with metal sheets which were not subjected<br>
to such treatment, as well as an enlarged deep-drawing working range. The<br>
metal sheets according to invention were also capable of being cleaned easily<br>
and entirely free of residue in a conventional degreasing system.<br>
