METHOD OF WRITING DATA ONTO A LENS, AND LENS COMPRISING<br>
WRITTEN DATA<br>
The present invention relates to a method of writing<br>
data onto an optical lens and to an optical lens<br>
comprising data written onto it.<br>
The production of holograms on an optical lens is known<br>
for decorative usage. Documents US 5 892 600 and<br>
DE 19 644 620 Al describe for example an optical lens<br>
having on its surface a hologram reconstructable in<br>
near field, providing a decorative function, which<br>
decorative function is combined with an identification<br>
role in the case of DE 19 644 620 Al. Document<br>
WO 01/23921 Al discloses an optical lens having on its<br>
surface a set of holograms reconstructable in far<br>
field, providing a decorative function.<br>
Within the context of the present invention, the<br>
purpose of writing the hologram onto the lens is to<br>
record relevant data for its production or its use,<br>
without modifying its use as an optical lens.<br>
It is difficult to write data onto an optical lens<br>
without impeding its use. This is because a lens is<br>
transparent and data written onto one of its faces<br>
could produce shadows when a light beam passes through<br>
the lens. To reduce such an impediment, it is possible<br>
to write the data in small characters, or even<br>
microscopic characters. It is then necessary to use a<br>
magnifying instrument, such as a magnifying glass, to<br>
read the characters. Such an instrument is not<br>
convenient to use, in particular because the characters<br>
cannot be read by several users at the same time.<br>
Now, it is becoming increasingly necessary to indicate<br>
on a lens various items of information such as, for<br>
example, a manufacturing or serial number, an optical<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
characteristic of the lens, an indication of the<br>
constituent material of the lens, an indication of the<br>
provenance or distribution channel, or even a price or<br>
a code relating to these various characteristics.<br>
Furthermore, in the ophthalmic field, it is now<br>
frequent to produce customized corrective lenses,<br>
especially according to the ametropia of the person<br>
wearing the spectacles. A correction to the wearer's<br>
sight is thus obtained, this being more finely tailored<br>
to the diagnosed ametropia. In this case, the amount of<br>
data that it is useful to write onto the corrective<br>
lens may be substantial. Furthermore, the way in which<br>
the data is written onto the lens must be compatible<br>
with the requirement for medical confidentiality.<br>
An object of the invention is therefore to propose a<br>
method for writing data onto a lens that does not have<br>
the abovementioned drawbacks.<br>
To this end, the invention provides a method of writing<br>
data onto an optical lens, which comprises the<br>
following steps:<br>
a)	recording a source image containing the data;<br>
b)	generating a hologram of said source image by<br>
calculation; and<br>
c)	writing the hologram onto the lens.<br>
The hologram thus written onto the lens defines a<br>
diffractive zone which is generally unsuitable for<br>
vision as it affects the transmission of spatial<br>
frequencies of the electromagnetic wave, and therefore<br>
the capability of that portion of the lens in question<br>
to act as an imaging device. For this reason, within<br>
the context of the invention, the area of the written<br>
hologram is between 0.5 and 15 mm2, preferably less<br>
than 5 mm2. This size range is limited so as to<br>
minimize the impediment to the user of the lens, and<br>
especially to allow the hologram to be preferentially<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
positioned away from the central region of the lens.<br>
The term "optical lens" is understood in particular to<br>
mean ophthalmic lenses and lenses for optical<br>
instruments. The term "ophthalmic lens" is understood<br>
to mean lenses to be fitted into the frame of the<br>
spectacle or visor type, for protecting the eyes and/or<br>
for correcting sight, these lenses being chosen from<br>
afocal, unifocal, bifocal, trifocal and progressive<br>
lenses. Such lenses may be transparent or colored. The<br>
term "colored lens" is understood to mean a lens having<br>
a level of transmission between 3% and 90% inclusive.<br>
Beyond 90%, a lens is considered to be a transparent<br>
lens. Within the context of the invention, ophthalmic<br>
lenses are preferably understood to mean those<br>
described above for being fitted into a spectacles<br>
frame.<br>
Given that, according to the invention, the data are<br>
written onto the lens in the form of a hologram, they<br>
cannot be read directly. The confidentiality<br>
requirement is thus met.<br>
Furthermore, the hologram can be read by directing at<br>
least one coherent light beam onto the lens or through<br>
the lens, at the location of the hologram. Such an<br>
operation for reading a hologram is well known. It is<br>
simple and the data appear in a read-out image that<br>
reconstructs the source image of the hologram. The<br>
read-out image is projected onto a screen at a certain<br>
distance from the lens, so that it is large enough for<br>
several people to be able to read the data at the same<br>
time.<br>
Advantageously, the hologram is designed to form the<br>
read-out image of the data when said hologram is<br>
illuminated by a laser. To read the data, it therefore<br>
suffices to use a small laser, of the diode laser pen<br>
type  for  example,  of  a  standard  model,  which  is<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
inexpensive and not bulky.<br>
Advantageously, an optical device may be added to the<br>
diode laser in order to project the read-out image onto<br>
an image sensor, such as for example a CCD or CMOS<br>
matrix. Since the sensor is connected to a computer,<br>
such a configuration allows the read-out image to be<br>
rapidly read and the data that it contains can be<br>
automatically extracted.<br>
The writing method may be used for all types of data,<br>
especially corresponding to identification of the lens<br>
and to technical, logistic, commercial, medical or<br>
marketing information.<br>
More precisely, but not limitingly, the data contained<br>
in the hologram may relate to the particulars of the<br>
wearer, the particulars of the prescriber, the<br>
particulars of the vendor, all the technical data<br>
useful for calculating the optical surfaces of the lens<br>
and all the data relating to the manufacture of the<br>
lens, such as for example the nature of materials used<br>
to manufacture the lens and the dates of manufacture.<br>
The data contained in the hologram may also relate to<br>
all the characteristics of the frame that can receive<br>
the lens and all the data useful for cutting or<br>
trimming the lens and for fitting it into a frame. Also<br>
possibly contained in the hologram are data relating to<br>
the lens wearing conditions, such as for example the<br>
distance between eye and lens, and also data relating<br>
to the conditions of use of the lens, such as for<br>
example a preferential use. In addition, commercial<br>
data may also be contained in the hologram, such as for<br>
example the dates of prescription and purchase of the<br>
lens, and the desirable date of replacement of the<br>
lens.<br>
The density of the data that can be contained in the<br>
hologram may be particularly high,  without it being<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
more difficult to read the data by illuminating the<br>
hologram. In particular, a hologram measuring 1 square<br>
millimeter (1 mm2) in area may contain several<br>
kilobytes written redundantly in order to obtain<br>
sufficient surety of data reconstruction. The hologram<br>
may therefore be written onto the lens by occupying a<br>
very small surface portion of the lens. Within the<br>
context of the invention, the hologram occupies a<br>
portion of the surface of the lens with an area between<br>
15 mm2 and 0.5 mm2 inclusive, preferably less than<br>
5 mm2.<br>
Preferably, the hologram is written onto the lens near<br>
a peripheral edge of the latter. In this way, the<br>
impediment caused by the hologram during use of the<br>
lens is reduced. When the lens is a blank, such as for<br>
example the blank of an ophthalmic lens, the hologram<br>
may be written in a part of the lens intended to be<br>
trimmed off. The blank is then marked right up to the<br>
moment of trimming it, for example for the purpose of<br>
traceability or logistics, but it causes no impediment<br>
when the lens is being used.<br>
According to another particular embodiment of the<br>
invention, the data contained in the source image are<br>
in coded form. In particular, the source image may<br>
contain a barcode corresponding to the data. An<br>
additional degree of confidentiality may thus be<br>
introduced in order to gain access to the data written<br>
on the lens, especially using an algorithm for coding<br>
or representing the data in the source image that is<br>
kept secret.<br>
The invention also relates to an optical lens,<br>
especially an ophthalmic lens, comprising data written<br>
in the form of a hologram.<br>
Such a lens may be produced using a method as described<br>
above, in order to write data of various types onto it.<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
Other features and advantages of the present invention<br>
will become apparent in the description below of<br>
nonlimiting exemplary embodiments, with reference to<br>
the appended drawings in which:<br>
-	figure 1 is a diagram of the steps of a method<br>
of writing data according to the invention;<br>
-	figures 2a and 2b each show an ophthalmic lens<br>
blank on which data are written in accordance with the<br>
invention;<br>
-	figures 3a-3c are enlargements of a hologram<br>
written onto a lens according to the invention;<br>
-	figure 4 illustrates the step of reading out the<br>
written data according to the invention; and<br>
-	figure 5 shows a lens bearing written data in an<br>
improvement of the invention.<br>
For the sake of clarity of the figures, the dimensions<br>
of the elements shown are not in proportion with actual<br>
dimensions. Furthermore, identical references in<br>
different figures denote identical elements or elements<br>
that have identical functions.<br>
According to figure 1, the method of writing data onto<br>
an optical lens starts with the construction of a<br>
source image containing the data (step 10). A very wide<br>
variety of methods for generating the image may be<br>
used, such as photography, the scanning of a printed<br>
sheet, etc. Preferably, the source image is generated<br>
by calculation, for example using a computer. The image<br>
is recorded in the form of a table of light values<br>
assigned to pixels of the source image. No physical<br>
medium of the source image, such as a sheet of paper or<br>
a display table, is therefore necessary. The data<br>
contained in the source image may be juxtaposed<br>
alphanumeric characters, a barcode corresponding to the<br>
data intended to be read, or any other means of<br>
visually representing data.<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
A hologram of the source image is then calculated by<br>
the computer (step 20) . Various programs are currently-<br>
available for generating a hologram from a source<br>
image. The function of these programs is mainly to<br>
carry out a Fourier transform on the source image. The<br>
hologram obtained, in the form of a matrix of values,<br>
is usually called a computer-generated hologram. The<br>
nature of the hologram obtained, namely an amplitude<br>
hologram or a phase hologram, and also the pixel<br>
density in the hologram and the number of possible<br>
levels of the amplitude or phase assigned to each pixel<br>
in the hologram depend on the program used and/or its<br>
parameter set-up. In particular, binary holograms may<br>
be calculated in this way, for which the amplitude<br>
assigned to each pixel can take only two values. These<br>
two amplitude values are 0 and 1 for a binary amplitude<br>
hologram and -1 and +1 for a binary phase hologram.<br>
When calculating the hologram by a computer, it is<br>
possible to take into account the curvature of the<br>
surface onto which the hologram will be written, in<br>
order to minimize any distortion of the read-out image<br>
when reconstructing the image under laser illumination.<br>
Likewise, if the hologram is written onto a lens the<br>
optical power of the lens at the location where the<br>
hologram is written can be taken into account, so as to<br>
meet certain desirable read-out image reconstruction<br>
conditions.<br>
The hologram is then written onto the lens. This<br>
writing operation may be carried out in various ways,<br>
especially by laser etching. In this case, a laser beam<br>
scans juxtaposed regions of a surface portion of the<br>
lens with an irradiation power that corresponds to the<br>
pixel amplitude values of the hologram. Depending on<br>
the irradiation power for each pixel, the laser<br>
pulverizes part of the material on the surface of the<br>
lens or does not pulverize it. In this way, the<br>
hologram is written onto the lens in the form of ridges<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
and grooves. Alternatively, the lens portion may be<br>
covered with a metal film, which is removed at the<br>
locations of the pixels of the hologram being written<br>
through the impacts of the laser, in accordance with<br>
the amplitude value associated with each pixel.<br>
Preferably, a pattern corresponding to the hologram is<br>
firstly written onto a mold (step 30) . For a binary<br>
hologram, the amplitude values that may be associated<br>
with each pixel of the hologram correspond to two<br>
different heights of the surface of the mold, these<br>
being separated for example by 1 |μm.<br>
According to a first method of implementing the<br>
invention, writing the hologram onto the lens comprises<br>
the following substeps:<br>
producing a mold transparent to UV radiation<br>
and patterned with ridges and grooves corresponding to<br>
the hologram;<br>
covering the lens with a layer of a UV-curable<br>
fluid;<br>
applying the mold onto to the layer (step 40)<br>
so that the fluid penetrates the grooves between the<br>
ridges and, at the same time, directing a UV light beam<br>
onto the layer through the mold, so as to cure the<br>
molded fluid; and<br>
removing the mold from the lens.<br>
Such a writing method is well known and commonly<br>
referred to as "UV embossing" or "UV molding". A<br>
suitable material for the mold is, for example, a<br>
siloxane-type elastomer such as that one sold by Dow<br>
Corning under the brand name Sylgard 184.<br>
Furthermore, an elastomer mold is particularly suitable<br>
for writing a pattern onto a pseudo-spherical surface.<br>
According to a second method of implementing the<br>
invention, writing the hologram onto the lens comprises<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
the following substeps:<br>
producing a mold patterned with ridges and<br>
grooves corresponding to the hologram;<br>
covering the lens with a layer of a thermally-<br>
curable fluid;<br>
applying the mold onto the layer (step 40) so<br>
that the fluid penetrates the grooves between the<br>
ridges and, at the same time, the layer is exposed to a<br>
heat source through the mold, so as to cure the molded<br>
fluid; and<br>
removing the mold from the lens.<br>
Within the context of the invention, the term "pseudo-<br>
spherical surface" is understood to mean a continuous,<br>
concave or convex, surface, that is to say one not<br>
containing holes or steps. In general, at least one of<br>
the two faces of an optical lens is pseudo-spherical so<br>
that the variation in thickness of the lens that<br>
results therefrom gives it an optical power. Afocal,<br>
unifocal, bifocal, trifocal or progressive ophthalmic<br>
lenses all have at least one pseudo-spherical face. A<br>
spherical surface corresponds to one particular case of<br>
a pseudo-spherical surface, for which the radii of<br>
curvature of the surface along two perpendicular<br>
directions are equal. Hereafter, the expression<br>
"pseudo-spherical surface" is understood as including<br>
the particular case of spherical surfaces.<br>
To write the hologram onto a pseudo-spherical lens<br>
surface, the layer of curable fluid is placed on this<br>
surface so as to entirely cover the place for writing<br>
the hologram. The mold must be pliant enough to deform<br>
so as to conform to the pseudo-spherical surface of the<br>
lens when it is applied to the layer of curable fluid.<br>
One drawback of this method of implementation is due to<br>
the fact that the hologram written onto the lens is<br>
directly exposed to dirt. It may also be damaged by the<br>
surface of the lens being accidentally scratched. Data<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
read-out can then be difficult, given that dirt or<br>
scratches on the hologram generate interference in the<br>
read-out image.<br>
According to a second method of implementing the<br>
invention, writing the hologram onto the lens comprises<br>
the following substeps:<br>
producing a mold patterned with ridges and<br>
grooves corresponding to the hologram (step 30); and<br>
pouring a first refringent lens material (step<br>
40) into the mold.<br>
In this case, the hologram-patterned mold is used<br>
directly to form the lens. It must therefore be made of<br>
a rigid material. Usually, the first refringent<br>
material of the lens is an organic material, for<br>
example based on polycarbonate or polyethylene.<br>
A part of the lens bearing the hologram is then coated<br>
with a second refringent material, said first and<br>
second refringent materials having different respective<br>
refractive indices. The second refringent material may<br>
also be an organic material. The hologram is therefore<br>
written into the lens at the interface between the two<br>
refringent materials. It therefore can no longer be<br>
degraded by the lens being accidentally scratched.<br>
Furthermore, for such a configuration of the lens, the<br>
legibility of the data in the read-out image is barely<br>
affected by the dirtiness of the lens.<br>
Figures 2a and 2b each show an ophthalmic lens blank 1.<br>
As is known, the ophthalmic lens 2 is obtained by<br>
trimming the blank 1. The trimming outline is indicated<br>
by the dashed lines in the figures. The hologram 3 may<br>
be written onto the blank either on the inside of the<br>
trimming outline (figure 2a) or on the outside of the<br>
outline (figure 2b) . The writing on the outside of the<br>
trimming outline is appropriate when the written data<br>
is no longer of any interest after the lens has been<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
fitted into a frame. This may be the case, for example,<br>
for logistic or commercial data. Conversely, it may be<br>
advantageous to write medical data on the inside of the<br>
trimming outline, so that they remain permanently on<br>
the lens. For example, a lens conformity check with<br>
respect to a medical prescription may thus be effected<br>
on an assembled pair of spectacles.<br>
Figure 3a shows part of a binary hologram written onto<br>
the ophthalmic lens 2. The hologram consists of a<br>
matrix of 400 x 400 approximately square pixels, each<br>
pixel having for example sides of 1 fim. The hologram<br>
thus measures 0.4 mm x 0.4 mm, which is small enough<br>
not to generate an appreciable impediment for the<br>
person wearing the lens. Visually, the hologram 3<br>
appears as a small diffusing square, which is whitish<br>
or has a slightly reflecting appearance. Given that, in<br>
this case, each pixel corresponds to a defined level of<br>
the lens surface between two possible levels, the<br>
hologram appears as a juxtaposition of ridges and<br>
grooves, denoted 4 and 5 respectively. According to the<br>
general principles of holograms, a potentially vertical<br>
arrangement of the ridges 4 and grooves 5 in figure 3a<br>
indicates that the source image has a structure that is<br>
more accentuated in the horizontal direction than in<br>
the vertical direction. In the present case, the data<br>
contained in the source image are in the form of a<br>
horizontally oriented barcode.<br>
Figures 3b and 3c are cross sections of the lens 2 at<br>
the location of the hologram 3 for each of the first<br>
and second methods of writing the hologram 3 described<br>
above. Figure 3b corresponds to the UV-embossing<br>
writing method and figure 3c corresponds to the<br>
hologram being written at the interface between two<br>
constituent refringent materials of the lens. In figure<br>
3b, the reference 6 denotes the layer of cured fluid<br>
and in figure 3c the references 7 and 8 denote the<br>
respective first and second refringent materials of<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
which the lens 2 is made.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the data-readout step. The<br>
ophthalmic lens 2 is illuminated with a low-power laser<br>
pen 100, possibly including a collimation lens, the<br>
beam emitted being for example red in color, at the<br>
location of the hologram 3. As is known, the distance<br>
between the laser 100 and the hologram 3 is of no<br>
importance. The light beam 101 output by the laser 100<br>
is diffracted by the hologram 3 so that it is divided<br>
into two secondary beams 102 and 103 after having<br>
passed through the lens 2. Each of the two beams 102<br>
and 103 reconstructs the source image at a distance<br>
from the lens 2 that may for example be between 20 cm<br>
and 50 cm. The reconstructed source image is then<br>
revealed by placing an object 104 serving as screen in<br>
the path of one of the two beams 102 or 103. Owing to<br>
the fact that the light used is output by a laser, the<br>
object serving as screen for revealing the<br>
reconstructed source image may be any object. The<br>
reconstructed source image is square or rectangular in<br>
shape, with sides measuring several centimeters. It is<br>
therefore easily legible by several people at the same<br>
time. It can also advantageously be projected onto an<br>
image sensor, for example of the CCD or CMOS type, in<br>
order to allow rapid recognition of the image and also<br>
analysis of the image using a computer to extract the<br>
data that it contains. In figure 4, the reconstructed<br>
images corresponding to each of the two beams 102 and<br>
103 are referenced 105 and 106 respectively. They are<br>
called read-out images and each represents the barcode<br>
initially contained in the source image. The images 105<br>
and 10 6 may correspond to two opposed orders of<br>
diffraction, for example +1 and -1, so that the two<br>
images 105 and 106 are reversed one with respect to the<br>
other. As is known, when the hologram 3 is of the phase<br>
hologram type, it is possible to adapt each pixel so<br>
that one of the two read-out images produced by<br>
diffraction of the beam 101 by the hologram 3  is<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
brighter than the other.<br>
In an improvement of the invention, the hologram is<br>
written at several locations on the lens. Given that<br>
the cross section of the light beam 101 produced by the<br>
laser 100 is of the order of 1 mm2, several written<br>
holograms may be illuminated simultaneously. Each<br>
written hologram therefore contributes to the read-out<br>
image (s) so that it (they) is (are) brighter in a<br>
manner substantially proportional to the number of<br>
written holograms illuminated simultaneously.<br>
Advantageously, some of the multiple written holograms<br>
3 on the lens are mutually contiguous. The contrast of<br>
the read-out image(s) is therefore improved.<br>
Optionally, each written hologram 3 may constitute a<br>
pixel of an image directly legible on the lens. Figure<br>
5 and its enlarged detail illustrate such an<br>
improvement. In the example here, all the written<br>
holograms 3 on the surface of the ophthalmic blank 1<br>
together form the letter "a" of millimeter size.<br>
A method of writing data according to the invention<br>
therefore has many advantages, among which the<br>
following may be mentioned or recalled:<br>
-	the method is compatible with the requirement<br>
for an optical lens to be transparent;<br>
-	the  method  is  compatible  with  the  esthetic<br>
requirements specific to ophthalmic use;<br>
-	the hologram pattern written onto the lens may<br>
be easily calculated using standard computing means;<br>
-	several alternative methods may be used to write<br>
the  hologram onto  the  lens,  these  being  easy to<br>
implement;<br>
-	the data written onto the lens can be read in a<br>
simple, rapid and inexpensive manner;<br>
-	no contact with the faces of the lens is needed<br>
to  read  the  written  data,  so  that  the  risk  of<br>
scratching the lens when reading the data is reduced;<br>
-	the method is compatible with the requirement<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
for confidentiality of the written data, since they<br>
cannot be read directly on the lens;<br>
-	the amount of data that can be written onto any<br>
one lens may be considerable, without this resulting in<br>
a noticeable impediment when the lens is being used;<br>
and<br>
-	the data written onto the lens may replace data<br>
written  on  a  package  for  the  lens.  Switching  of<br>
respective packages of several lenses is therefore of<br>
no consequence - it can be readily detected and, if<br>
necessary, corrected.<br>
Finally, the hologram may be written onto the lens in<br>
such a way that the read-out image corresponds to the<br>
source image positively or negatively depending on<br>
whether a light pixel in the source image is<br>
reconstructed in the read-out image in the form of a<br>
light pixel or a dark pixel.<br><br>
