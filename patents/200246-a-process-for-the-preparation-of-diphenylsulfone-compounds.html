				<td>Technical Fields:<br>
The present invention relates to processes for the preparation of 4,4"-<br>
dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone monoethers useful as developers for thermal recording agents.<br>
Background Art:<br>
Dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone monoethers are developers excellent in coloring<br>
sensitivity, preservability, heat resistance and other properties, and are often used for<br>
thermal recording papers for facsimiles, barcodes, receipts and the like.<br>
Processes for the preparation of, for example, a 4-alkoxy-4"-hydroxydiphenyl sulfone<br>
(which may hereinafter refer to as the target compound), among the dihydroxydiphenyl<br>
sulfone monoethers, by a reaction of 4,4"-dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone (which may hereinafter<br>
refer to as BPS) with a halogen compound such as an alkyl halide in the presence of an<br>
alkali in a polar solvent such as dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide and alcohol, have<br>
been disclosed in each of Japanese Patents Laid-open Nos. Sho 58-20493, Sho 58-82788,<br>
Sho 60-13852, Sho 60-56949 and Hei 6-25148. These methods have a drawback that it is<br>
difficult to improve reaction selectivity because of use of solvents dissolving reaction<br>
reagents and reaction products very well. A problem has been a production of a noticeable<br>
amount of a diether derivative byproduct, 4,4"-dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone diether.<br>
WO 91/11433 has disclosed that a reaction of BPS with an alkyl halide in the<br>
presence of 1.5 to 3 moles of an alkali to a mole of BPS in 0.3 to 1.5 parts by weight of an<br>
aqueous solvent to a part by weight of 4,4"-dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone gives satisfactory<br>
results in both selectivity and yield.<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 3-258760 describes a method for separating<br>
BPS from a 4-alkoxy-4"-hydroxydiphenyl sulfone, in which an aqueous alkali solution and<br>
alcohols or ketones that do not mix with water are added to mix with a mixture containing<br>
BPS and a 4-alkoxy-4"-hydroxydiphenyl sulfone, and the 4-alkoxy-4"-hydroxydiphenyl<br>
sulfone is moved into the organic layer and the alkali metal salt of BPS into the aqueous<br>
layer for separation.<br>
In Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 60-56949, a purification method of a 4-<br>
alkoxy-4"-hydroxydiphenyl sulfone is described in which a solution of a water-nonmiscible<br>
organic solvent containing a 4-alkoxy-4"-hydroxydiphenyl sulfone and unreacted BPS that is<br>
produced when BPS is alkylated or by other methods is shaken with an aqueous solution of<br>
hydrogen carbonate so that BPS moves into water for removal.<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 5-255234 describes a method for producing a<br>
4-alkoxy-4"-hydroxydiphenyl sulfone, in which an alkyl halide is added to a two-phase<br>
solvent system consisting of an aqueous solution of an alkaline compound in which BPS is<br>
dissolved and a water-nonmiscible organic solvent, and an alkaline compound is added to<br>
keep pH to 7.5 to 9.5, in a method for producing a 4-alkoxy-4"-hydroxydiphenyl sulfone by<br>
reacting BPS with an alkyl halide.<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 10-158235 has disclosed a method for<br>
purifying a 4-alkoxy-4"-hydroxydiphenyl sulfone, in which an alkali metal ion donor is added<br>
to an aqueous solution of a mixture containing a BPS alkali metal salt and an alkali metal<br>
salt of a 4-alkoxy-4"-hydroxydiphenyl sulfone to deposit and separate the alkali metal salt of<br>
4-alkoxy-4"-hydroxydiphenyl sulfone, followed by treatment of the salt with an acid.<br>
In the above production methods, the reaction solution contains the target<br>
compound as well as unreacted BPS, a byproduct of 4,4"-dialkoxydiphenyl sulfone and other<br>
impurities, as a side reaction proceeds simultaneously. These impurities damage the<br>
performance of the product when used as a developer. Therefore, a purification process to<br>
remove the impurities from the reaction solution is required.<br>
Of the said impurities, the 4,4"-dialkoxydiphenyl sulfone, which is insoluble in water,<br>
can be removed in a way that the reaction solution is made an aqueous alkaline solution, a<br>
water-nonmiscible organic solvent is added and the sulfone is extracted into the organic<br>
layer for separation.<br>
To remove unreacted BPS, a water-nonmiscible organic solvent is added to the<br>
reaction solution to produce a two-phase system consisting of an organic and an aqueous<br>
layers, the pH value of the aqueous layer is adjusted to a preset value to move the target<br>
compound into the organic layer and BPS into the aqueous layer, then the organic layer is<br>
separated, washed with water if necessary and cooled, and deposited crystals are<br>
separated by filtration so as to give the target compound. This separation/purification<br>
method utilizes the difference in acidity between the phenolic hydroxyl groups of BPS and<br>
the target compound.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention:<br>
However, the difference in acidity between the phenolic hydroxyl groups of BPS<br>
and the target compound is subtle. BPS is completely removed if the pH of the aqueous<br>
layer is higher than the preset value. Then, it becomes difficult to separate the target<br>
compound completely into the organic layer, resulting in a large loss of the target compound.<br>
On the contrary, if the pH of the aqueous layer is lower than the preset value, the loss of the<br>
target compound is small. There has been a problem however that BPS moves into the<br>
organic layer so as to mix into the target compound as an impurity.<br>
As described above, 4,4"-dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone monoethers produced by<br>
methods of the prior art may not have been satisfactory in terms of purity. Particularly when<br>
a reaction solution obtained from a reaction of materials at high concentrations is purified<br>
according to the aforementioned methods, BPS often tends to mix into the target compound<br>
as an impurity because of insufficient purification.<br>
4,4-Dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone monoethers are mainly used as developers. There<br>
have however been problems that, for example, a so-called background foggy phenomenon,<br>
which is the coloring of the surrounding area of a heated part on a thermal recording paper,<br>
occurs if 0.4% or more of BPS is contained in 4,4"-dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone monoethers.<br>
Therefore, development of production methods for isolating highly pure 4,4"-<br>
dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone monoethers has been looked for.<br>
When 4,4"-dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone monoethers are produced in industrial scales,<br>
reaction solutions may sometimes be colored. In this case, the products, 4,4"-<br>
dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone monoethers, are also colored. It is sometimes difficult to decolor<br>
the products (to remove coloring substances) completely, even if processes such as<br>
decoloring and purification using activated carbon and the like are carried out afterward.<br>
Another problem has been a requirement of a new process for removing the added<br>
decoloring agents.<br>
As described above, 4,4"-dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone monoethers are mainly used<br>
as developers. Because of the purpose of their use, developers are not satisfactory even if<br>
slightly colored.<br>
It has been required therefore to establish industrial processes for producing non-<br>
colored, highly pure 4,4"-dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone monoethers in high yield.<br>
In addition, when 4,4"-dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone monoethers are taken out as<br>
crystals at the final stage and the crystals are dried by a hot dryer, the crystals may become<br>
lumps so that solvents cannot be removed completely. The monoethers containing solvents<br>
have a problem of performance as products. As 4,4"-dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone monoethers<br>
are used in the state of dispersing in solvents such as water, products of small crystal size,<br>
which are easily dispersed, are demanded. If there are block particles after the crystals are<br>
dried, a further process for pulverizing is required. To produce a product of small particle<br>
size, pulverization process work has sometimes become too complicated.<br>
The present invention has been carried out in consideration of the aforementioned<br>
situations. It is an object of the present invention to provide methods for producing non-<br>
colored, highly pure 4,4"-dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone monoethers in high yield and<br>
advantageously in industrial production.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have studied in earnest to solve the above<br>
problems. As a result, it has been found that the problems can be solved by that (1) BPS is<br>
removed efficiently if pH is adjusted step by step, (2) an alkyl halide used in the reaction<br>
remains and decomposes in the forming process so as to color the product, (3) the presence<br>
of metal ions, such as iron, in a solvent used in the production process causes coloring and<br>
substances producing the ions are removed, and (4) the product is dried with mechanical<br>
stir. Thus the present invention has been completed.<br>

A compound of Formula (V) can be produced using, instead of a compound of<br>
Formula (III), a compound represented by Formula (IX)<br>
A1-X-A2 or A3-Y-A4 (IX)<br>
(wherein, A1to A4 are each independently halogen), according to a method for producing a<br>
compound of (I) which is described later. The product is a single compound or a mixture of<br>
several compounds. The present invention is applicable to separate or purify these<br>
compounds from starting materials and byproducts.<br>
There are no particular restrictions on methods for synthesizing compounds<br>
represented by Formula (I) (hereinafter referred to as Compound (I)), except inventions<br>
relating to (Composition 15) and (Composition 18). A method for reacting a compound<br>
represented by Formula (II) (hereinafter referred to as Compound (II)) with a compound<br>
represented by Formula (III) (hereinafter referred to as Compound (III)) in a solvent in the<br>
presence of an alkali is exemplified as most preferred.<br>
In Formula (III), X is halogen such as chlorine, bromine or iodine. Actual examples<br>
of compounds of Formula (III) include alkyl halides such as methyl iodide, ethyl iodide, ethyl<br>
bromide, n-propyl iodide, n-propyl bromide, n-propyl chloride, isopropyl iodide, isopropyl<br>
bromide, isopropyl chloride, n-butyl iodide, n-butyl bromide, sec-butyl iodide, sec-butyl<br>
bromide, t-butyl iodide, t-butyl bromide, n-pentyl iodide, n-pentyl bromide, n-hexyl iodide and<br>
n-hexyl bromide; alkenyl halides such as allyl chloride, allyl bromide, allyl iodide, crotyl<br>
chloride and crotyl bromide; cycloalkyl halides such as cyclopropyl iodide, cyclopropyl<br>
bromide, cyclopropyl chloride, cyclopentyl iodide, cyclopentyl bromide, cyclopentyl chloride,<br>
cyclohexyl iodide, cyclohexyl bromide and cyclohexyl chloride; and aralkyl halides such as<br>
benzyl iodide, benzyl bromide, benzyl chloride, 4-chlorobenzyl iodide, 4-methylbenzyl<br>
bromide, 3-chlorobenzyl chloride, (i-phenyl)ethyl iodide, (i-phenyl)ethyl bromide, 2-<br>
phenylethyl bromide, 2-phenylethyl chloride and 3-phenylpropyl bromide.<br>
Of them, a preferred compound of Formula (III) is where X is bromine. It is<br>
particularly favorable to use isopropyl bromide. An amount of Compound (III) used is usually<br>
in the range of 1 to 3 moles, preferably 1 to 1.5 moles, to a mole of Compound (II).<br>
Actual examples of bases used for the reaction include alkali metal hydroxides<br>
such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide; alkaline earth metal hydroxides such<br>
as magnesium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide; alkali metal carbonates such as calcium<br>
carbonate; and organic amines such as triethylamine, pyridine and diazabicyclo[5.4.0]unde-<br>
7-cene. Of them, alkalis including alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide are<br>
particularly preferred. An amount of a base used is usually in the range of 1 to 5 moles,<br>
preferably 1.5 to 3 moles, to a mole of Compound (II).<br>
Examples of solvents used include water; amides such as N,N-dimethylformamide<br>
and N,N-dimethylacetamide; alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and propanol; and two-<br>
phase, mixture solvents such as water-toluene, water-xylene and water-benzene. An<br>
amount of a solvent used is usually in the range of 0.1 to 10 parts by weight to a part by<br>
weight of Compound (II).<br>
A reaction method is, for example, by adding Compound (III) to a solution of an<br>
alkali salt of Compound (II). There are no particular restrictions on how to add Compound<br>
(III). Examples are a method of dropping a fixed amount of Compound (2) continuously into<br>
a reaction solution and adding Compound (III) little by little over several times. A reaction is<br>
carried out usually at a temperature between room temperature and the boiling point of the<br>
solvent, preferably between 45 to 80°C, and normally finishes in about 1 to 25 hours.<br>
A method for producing a compound of Formula (I) in the present invention is a<br>
general term for all processes from starting materials to the completion of a product,<br>
covering a reaction process for reacting starting materials to give a reaction mixture<br>
containing Compound (I), such as a process for reacting Compound (II) with Compound (III),<br>
as well as a purification process, such as separation of the materials and impurities;<br>
processes for separating Compound (I) after the completion of the purification process, such<br>
as crystallization, distillation, filtration and recrystallization; and processes particularly<br>
required for industrial production, such as drying and solvent recovery. Actual examples are<br>
a combination of a series of processes of pretreatment, reaction, purification, crystallization,<br>
filtration, drying and solvent recovery, and a combination of each process twice or more.<br>
The reaction mixture thus obtained contains Compound (I) as well as impurities<br>
such as unreacted Compound (II), unreacted Compound (III) and a byproduct of 4,4"-<br>
dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone diether. It is therefore necessary to separate these impurities<br>
from the reaction mixture, that is, purification of the reaction mixture, in order to produce the<br>
target compound of high purity.<br>
The production method of the present invention is described in detail, using as an<br>
example, when a reaction mixture of 4,4"-dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone (hereinafter referred to<br>
as BPS) and Compound (III) is purified to isolate the target compound, that is, a compound<br>
represented by Formula (V) (hereinafter referred to as Compound (V)).<br>
To react BPS with Compound (III) in the presence of a base, it is usually carried out<br>
in a way that, for example, a BSP salt produced from BPS and a base is reacted with<br>
Compound (III). Solubility of the BPS salt in non-polar organic solvents is low so that the<br>
reaction is usually carried out in a polar solvent, water or a mixed solvent of water and<br>
organic solvents. BPS has two positions to form a salt with a base in one molecule. A<br>
problem is therefore how to control the production of a byproduct of 4,4"-dihydroxydiphenyl<br>
sulfone diether (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the diether) in the reaction.<br>
For example, thanks to the fact that a salt of Compound (V) with a base (alkali)<br>
(hereinafter referred to as Compound (V) salt) is less soluble in water than the said di-salt<br>
compound is, there is a method that Compound (III) is reacted with the di-salt compound in<br>
a saturated or nearly saturated aqueous solution to deposit the Compound (V) salt to<br>
remove to the outside of the reaction system as crystals.<br>
Another example is that a reaction is carried out in a two-phase system of water<br>
and a water-nonmiscible organic solvent, which dissolves Compound (V) to some extent, pH<br>
is controlled to restrain the formation of the said di-salt and Compound (V) salt, and<br>
produced Compound (V) is dissolved in the organic solvent to remove into the outside of the<br>
system.<br>
In either method, after the reaction is completed, the reaction mixture contains<br>
impurities of BPS, the diether and others. If such impurities are contained, it is difficult to<br>
isolate the target compound of high purity as crystals only by operations such as<br>
recrystallization, because the structures of the impurities are similar to that of the target<br>
compound. A method is applied for separating the impurities by pH adjustments, as BPS,<br>
Compound (V) and the diether are different in acidity.<br>
An operation of purifying the said reaction mixture to isolate the target compound is<br>
carried out, for example, according to steps described below:<br>
(a) First, remove unreacted Compound (III).<br>
The reaction solution usually contains unreacted Compound (III). Compound (III) is<br>
generally unstable in water, particularly in an aqueous alkaline solution, and is more<br>
unstable and easily decomposes when heated. As described above, when water is used as<br>
a reaction solvent and an alkali as a base, Compound (III) has to be used in an excessive<br>
amount because of its easy decomposition during the reaction. Compound (III) decomposes<br>
to generate an acid if it is present in post-treatment processes, such as purification, after the<br>
reaction is completed. The acid reacts with the alkali to reduce pH of the reaction solution.<br>
The pH reduction is local and its change is small. An accurate pH adjustment is<br>
however particularly required, as described later, in order to separate the target compound<br>
into the organic layer and impurities into the aqueous alkali layer precisely. Non-uniform pH<br>
values or pH values different from preset values result in difficulties in complete separation<br>
of the target compound from starting materials and byproducts.<br>
In this reaction, the reaction solution was sometimes colored in the process for<br>
purifying the reaction solution after the reaction was completed and the product, Compound<br>
(V), also colored. Once the product is colored, a problem is difficulties in decoloring.<br>
The inventors have studied causes of the coloring in detail. As a result, it was<br>
considered that a reason why the reaction solution was colored in the purification process<br>
was because heavy metal ions, such as iron ions, contained in industrial water used as a<br>
reaction solvent and as water in the purification process or dissolved from an SUS reaction<br>
tank, formed chelate compounds with compounds having phenolic hydroxyl groups, such as<br>
Compound (V), and the chelate compounds were the cause of the coloring. It was also<br>
considered that the chelate compounds, which caused coloring, were easily formed<br>
because the pH value of the reaction solution lowered locally to produce a pH region where<br>
a compound having a phenolic group could form a chelate compound with a heavy metal ion.<br>
It is therefore necessary to control pH precisely and uniformly in the purification process in<br>
order to efficiently prevent the formation of the chelate compounds and to produce non-<br>
colored products.<br>
The present invention has made it possible to prevent the pH value of the reaction<br>
solution from changing due to the decomposition of Compound (III) so as to adjust the pH<br>
accurately, by providing a process for removing unreacted Compound (III) contained in the<br>
reaction solution in the process for purifying the reaction solution after the reaction is<br>
completed.<br>
Compound (III) may be removed after the completion of the reaction and before the<br>
isolation of the target compound. In the present invention, it is favorable to remove<br>
Compound (III) after the completion of the reaction and before the said pH adjustment of the<br>
aqueous layer, from the viewpoint of accurate pH adjustment with control of pH changes to<br>
the minimum. It is more favorable to remove unreacted Compound (III) after the reaction is<br>
completed and before the diether is extracted with organic solvents for removal. In other<br>
words, it is preferable to provide the process for removing Compound (III) immediately after<br>
the reaction process.<br>
There are no particular restrictions on methods for removing Compound (III).<br>
Examples include (1) after the reaction is completed, the reaction solution is heated to<br>
evaporate Compound (III) to remove; and (2) after the reaction is completed, an extract<br>
solvent, such as benzene or toluene, is added to the reaction solution to extract Compound<br>
(III) to remove.<br>
Of them, Method (1) is simpler in the present invention. In the operation of<br>
evaporating for removal in Method (1), it is preferable to distill out Compound (III) together<br>
with the solvents used for the reaction. Particularly when water is used as a reaction solvent,<br>
it is favorable to add a solvent azeotropic with water, such as toluene or benzene, and to<br>
distill out Compound (III) together with the mixed solvent, because Compound (III) can be<br>
recovered at a lower temperature with the minimum decomposition. Method (1) can be<br>
carried out at the atmospheric pressure or under reduced pressure. If performed under<br>
reduced pressure, unreacted Compound (III) can be evaporated to remove at a lower<br>
temperature so that pH changes due to the decomposition of Compound (III) can be<br>
controlled.<br>
Compound (III) removed from the reaction solution may be recovered or obtained<br>
by other means for reuse.<br>
In the production method of Compound (I) with a process for removing Compound<br>
(III) after Compound (II), such as BPS, and Compound (III) are reacted in 0.3 to 1.5 parts by<br>
weight of an aqueous solvent to a part by weight of Compound (II) in the presence of 1.5 to 3<br>
moles of an alkali to a mole of Compound (II) followed by distillation of Compound (III), if<br>
Compound (III) is heated to distill out and then water is further added to distill Compound<br>
(III) to remove, the compound is efficiently recovered and production of impurities, such as<br>
the diether, can be controlled.<br>
It is favorable to add water separately over several times. In addition, an amount of<br>
water added at the beginning is in the range of 0.03 and 0.1 parts by weight, more preferably<br>
0.04 and 0.08 parts by weight, to a part by weight of Compound (II). A favorable way is to<br>
control an amount of water added at the beginning for a sufficient recovery of Compound<br>
(III). If less than 0.03 parts by weight, Compound (III) cannot be distilled out sufficiently. If<br>
exceeds 0.1 parts by weight, impurities, such as the diether, are more produced. An amount<br>
of water added at the second time and after may be the same as that at the beginning, or<br>
larger if Compound (III) remains in small amount.<br>
The smaller an amount of Compound (III) remains in the reaction solution after<br>
Compound (III) is distilled out, the more preferable. It becomes more difficult to completely<br>
remove the compound by distillation with a larger reaction scale. Compound (III) remaining<br>
in the reaction solution after distillation may be contained, for example, in an organic solvent<br>
used in the process for crystallizing Compound (I) (Compound (V)) from the organic solvent,<br>
via post processes. The organic solvent used for the crystallization is often recovered for<br>
reuse after Compound (I) is filtrated. Reuse of the solvent containing a large amount of<br>
Compound (III), as described above, causes problems such as coloring of Compound (I)<br>
because of decomposition of Compound (III) in various processes. It is therefore necessary<br>
to reduce the amount of Compound (III) in the organic solvent. It is usually preferable to<br>
control to 1% by weight or less. It is favorable to distill out Compound (III) so that the content<br>
of Compound (III) in the organic solvent used in the crystallization process is 1% by weight<br>
or less.<br>
(b) Next, a water-nonmiscible solvent and, if required, water and/or an alkali (aqueous) are<br>
added to the reaction mixture to make a two-phase solution of organic and aqueous layers.<br>
When a polar solvent is used for the reaction, it is preferable to carry out this operation after<br>
the polar solvent is recovered or removed. It is also favorable to adjust pH to 8 or above to<br>
completely separate the diether from the Compound (V) salt. There are no particular<br>
restrictions on the said water-nonmiscible solvents if they are organic solvents that do not<br>
mix with water. Aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, xylene and benzene are preferably<br>
used. The separation operation separates the diether having no phenolic hydroxyl group<br>
into the organic layer and the target compound into the aqueous layer.<br>
The separation operation is favorably carried out at a temperature above the<br>
crystallization temperature, usually in the temperature range of 70 and 90°C, from the<br>
viewpoint of preventing the target compound, impurities and the like from crystallizing. An<br>
amount of the water-nonmiscible organic solvent used is usually in the range of 0.5 and 5 ml<br>
to 1g of BPS used as a starting material. Compound (V) produced and unreacted BPS are<br>
both soluble, but the diether is insoluble, in aqueous alkaline solutions. Without using a<br>
water-nonmiscible organic solvent, the diether can be removed in a way that a reaction<br>
mixture obtained after organic solvents and the like are removed (or after the reaction is<br>
completed if water is used as a reaction solvent) is adjusted pH to 8 or above and deposited<br>
diether is filtered off.<br>
(c) Then, the aqueous layer containing the target compound is separated. A water-<br>
nonmiscible organic solvent and, if required, water are added to the obtained aqueous layer<br>
to make a two-phase solution of organic and aqueous layers. The aqueous layer is adjusted<br>
pH to a preset value (P1). The adjustment of pH to the preset value (P1) separates the<br>
target compound into the organic layer and impurities including BPS into the aqueous alkali<br>
layer. The pH value is usually adjusted by adding an acid or alkali to the aqueous layer. In<br>
this case, after the pH of the aqueous layer is adjusted, a water-nonmiscible organic solvent<br>
may be added to extract the target compound.<br>
Examples of acids for use include hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and nitric acid.<br>
Sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide are exemplified as alkalis for use. An alkali,<br>
when used, can be added in a form of aqueous solution. It is preferable to add an acid or<br>
alkali little by little in amount while sufficiently stirring the whole mixture from the viewpoint of<br>
prevention of drastic pH changes and precise pH adjustment. The preset value (P1) of pH is<br>
usually in the range of 8 and 9, preferably 8.3 and 8.7. In this case, to prevent the target<br>
compound and impurities from crystallizing, it is favorable to add a water-nonmiscible<br>
organic solvent and water, as required, to the reaction solution and to carry out the<br>
separation operation while keeping a temperature above the crystallization temperature,<br>
usually in the range of 70 and 90°C.<br>
(d) Furthermore, water and, if required, a water-nonmiscible organic solvent are added to<br>
the organic layer obtained after the said aqueous layer is removed, to make again a two-<br>
phase solution, and the aqueous layer is adjusted pH to a preset value (P2). Particularly<br>
when the reaction mixture is high in concentration, a third layer in which the target<br>
compound is not completely separated from BPS and others may be formed near the<br>
interface between the organic and aqueous layers. In this case, it is necessary to remove<br>
the completely separated aqueous layer, and the remaining organic and third layers are<br>
adjusted pH for completely separating BPS from the target compound.<br>
In the prior art, water and a water-nonmiscible organic solvent are added to a<br>
reaction product containing the target compound to make a two-phase solution, pH of the<br>
aqueous layer is adjusted to a preset value to separate the organic layer, and the target<br>
compound is obtained from the organic layer. However, particularly when a reaction mixture<br>
of high concentration is purified, for example, when a reaction mixture obtained from a<br>
reaction of materials of high concentrations or a reaction mixture containing a high<br>
concentration of inorganic salt is purified without diluting it much, it has been difficult to<br>
separate the target compound from impurities with only one pH adjustment.<br>
The inventors have studied causes of the above difficulty. As a result, the following<br>
were considered to be causes of the difficulty in the complete separation of the target<br>
compound from impurities:<br>
(1) A difference in acidity between the phenolic hydroxyl groups of Compound (V) and BPS<br>
is small. Therefore, it is impossible to separate the target compound from BPS and<br>
others completely without an accurate pH adjustment.<br>
(2) Solubilities of both of the target compound and BPS in water and water-nonmiscible<br>
solvents are relatively small. Because of this, when a water-nonmiscible solvent is<br>
added to a mixture of these to make a two-phase solution, particularly when a solution of<br>
the mixture of high concentration is used, a third, intermediate layer in which Compound<br>
(V) and BPS are mixed without being separated is formed near the interface between<br>
the aqueous and organic layers. Therefore, their separation is insufficient. A ratio of the<br>
layer in the whole solution tends to become larger as a reaction product is higher in<br>
concentration.<br>
(3) Due to the effect of salting out by a large amount of inorganic salts produced from the<br>
reaction of Compound (III) with BPS, BPS salts do not dissolve in the aqueous layer<br>
completely and cannot dissolve in the organic layer either so as to take Compound (V) in<br>
to form the third layer.<br>
(4) On the other hand, when the target compound is produced at an industrial scale, fairly<br>
large amounts of water and a water-nonmiscible organic solvent cannot be added to the<br>
reaction solution because of work efficiency and capacities of reaction and treatment<br>
tanks.<br>
(5) Therefore, it may be often the case that it is difficult to completely separate the target<br>
compound, Compound (V), from BPS when a series of operations of adjusting pH of the<br>
aqueous layer to be treated to a preset value and separating the organic layer is carried<br>
out only once.<br>
Based on the above facts, in the present invention, a series of operations consisting of a<br>
pH adjustment of the aqueous layer of the two-phase solution and separation of the organic<br>
layer is repeated several times in order to produce the target compound of high purity in high<br>
yield.<br>
The present invention provides methods for producing 4,4"-dihydroxydiphenyl<br>
sulfone monoethers, in which the target compound of high purity is isolated efficiently from a<br>
mixture even if the mixture contains the target compound and impurities of high<br>
concentrations.<br>
When the reaction product obtained from a reaction of BPS with a compound of<br>
Formula (III) in a solvent in the presence of a base is purified, only a requirement is an<br>
addition of the operations of the pH adjustment of the aqueous layer of the two-phase<br>
solution and separation of the organic layer, without changing the current production lines at<br>
all.<br>
Therefore, according to the purification method of the present invention, 4,4"-<br>
dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone monoethers of extremely high purity can be produced<br>
advantageously in industrial production.<br>
The second pH adjustment can be done by an operation similar to that of the first.<br>
An adjustment of pH of the aqueous layer to a preset value (P2) removes impurities<br>
contained in the organic layer into the aqueous layer. The pH value (P2) can be set to the<br>
same value as that of P1. It is however preferable to set P2 very slightly different from the<br>
pH value of the first adjustment in order to completely separate the target compound from<br>
BPS. Setting P2 to a value lower than P1 is preferred. For example, P1 is set in the range of<br>
8.4 and 8.7 and P2 in the range of 8.3 and 8.6. A series of the operations of the pH<br>
adjustment of the aqueous layer of the two-phase solution and separation of the organic<br>
layer can be repeated further, if required.<br>
As described above, if a series of the operations of adjusting pH of the aqueous<br>
layer to the preset values (P1 and P2) and separating the organic layer is repeated twice or<br>
more in the process for purifying the reaction solution, 4,4"-dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone<br>
monoethers of extremely high purity can be isolated from the reaction mixture.<br>
In the process of purification with water and an organic solvent for removing<br>
impurities, other than Compound (I), from the reaction solution, as described above, by<br>
adjusting pH of the reaction solution produced from the reaction of Compound (II) with<br>
Compound (III) in a solvent in the presence of a base, it is preferable to set a concentration<br>
of the compound of Formula (III) in the organic solvent to 5% by weight or less, more<br>
preferably 2% by weight or below, and furthermore preferably 1% by weight or less. An<br>
organic solvent used for a purification process such as that mentioned above, is often an<br>
organic solvent, for example, that is used in a crystallization process and recovered for<br>
reuse. In this case, the solvent may contain compounds involved in the reaction. Of them,<br>
Compound (III) easily decomposes when contacts with water, alkali or the like. Use of an<br>
organic solvent containing such a compound for a purification process may cause problems<br>
including coloring of Compound (I). It is necessary to reduce the content of such an impurity<br>
as much as possible. To reduce an amount of Compound (III) contained in an organic<br>
solvent to be used in the purification process, a new organic solvent can be used instead of<br>
a recovered organic solvent for reuse. A recovered solvent after precision distillation may be<br>
also used. For an efficient production overall, however, it is preferable to distill out unreacted<br>
Compound (III) to the outside of the system as much as possible so as not to remain any, in<br>
the process for distilling Compound (III) to remove.<br>
(e) Finally, the organic layer is separated from the two-phase solution after the final pH<br>
adjustment is carried out, washed with water if necessary, and cooled to deposit crystals.<br>
The crystals are separated by filtration, washed with water and dried to give the target<br>
compound.<br>
Compound (I) may often form a molecular compound particularly with a<br>
crystallization solvent in the crystallization process for taking out the compound as crystals,<br>
because of its structural and electronic properties. If Compound (I) forming a molecular<br>
compound with the crystallization solvent or the like is filtrated and then heated to dry under<br>
reduced pressure while leaving to stand, the compound may melt simultaneously when the<br>
crystalline form as the molecular compound collapses, and form amorphous block particles<br>
with surrounding crystals in the condition of keeping the solvent inside, halfway through the<br>
process that the solvent breaks the bond with Compound (I) and vaporizes. There is no<br>
problem if the compound melts at a temperature above the melting point of Compound (I),<br>
because Compound (I) itself does not crystallize even if releasing the solvent molecule. In<br>
case of melting below the melting point of Compound (I), Compound (I) crystallizes after the<br>
molecular compound melts and the solvent vaporizes. Because of this, it is often the case<br>
that part of the solvent does not vaporize completely and is taken in the inside of block<br>
particles. It is very difficult to pulverize such block particles unless considerable force is<br>
applied from the outside. The solvent taken in the inside cannot be removed completely.<br>
Therefore, the present invention is characterized in drying with mechanical stir. It is<br>
particularly favorable to dry by heating under reduced pressure with mechanical stir.<br>
Actual examples of solvents to form molecular compounds with Compound (I)<br>
include water; alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol and 1,2-<br>
butanediol; ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and acetyl acetone; nitriles such<br>
as acetonitrile and benzonitrile; ethers such as diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, tetrahydrofuran<br>
and dioxane; esters such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate and butyl acetate; amides such as<br>
N,N-dimethylformamide and N,N-dimethylacetamide; halogenated hydrocarbons such as<br>
dichloromethane, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane and chlorobenzene; aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons such as dimethyl sulfoxide, benzene, toluene and xylene; and aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbons such as hexane, cyclohexane and decalin. Particularly, a molecular<br>
compound formed with an aromatic hydrocarbon, such as benzene or toluene, is preferably<br>
dried according to the method of the present invention, because the compound is apt to melt<br>
during this process.<br>
There are no particular restrictions on a ratio of Compound (I) and a solvent that<br>
form a molecular compound. Concretely, the ratio is in the range of 0.1 to 10 moles of a<br>
solvent to a mole of Compound (I).<br>
In the present invention, "mechanical stir" refers to stirring a molecular compound<br>
with a stirring apparatus. Actual examples of stirring apparatus include those with stirring<br>
blades such as inclined paddle blades, flat paddle blades, propeller blades, anchor blades,<br>
faudler blades, turbine blades, bull margin blades, max blend blades, full zone blades,<br>
ribbon blades, super mix blades or inter mig blades; and those with rotary disks such as disk,<br>
notched disk or screw.<br>
A vacuum stirring apparatus with a stirring apparatus may be of batch or<br>
continuous type. Actual examples include Paddle Dryer (made by Nippon Kansoki Co., Ltd),<br>
Multifin Processor (made by Nara Kikai Seisakusho Co., Ltd), Plough Share Mixer (made by<br>
Taiheiyo Kiko Co., Ltd) and Inklandent Dryer (made by Tukishima Kikai Co., Ltd).<br>
A stirring speed depends on a type of stirring apparatus used and other conditions.<br>
Approximately 1 to 10 revolutions/minute is usually satisfactory.<br>
A heating temperature differs, depending on a type of solvent to vaporize. For<br>
example, when toluene is used, it is preferably in the range of room temperature and 100°C,<br>
and particularly favorably from 50 to 90°C.<br>
Drying under reduced pressure is usually carried out at 200 mmHg or below, and<br>
preferably 150 mmHg or less in particular.<br>
The content of the solvent before and after drying can be measured by such a<br>
means as calorimetric analysis and differential thermal analysis.<br>
The present invention is characterized in use of a solvent, particularly water,<br>
containing 0.05 ppm or less of iron components in the process for producing Compound (I).<br>
It is preferable to use a solvent, such as water, containing a very small amount of iron<br>
components throughout the production processes. However, it is not always necessary to<br>
use it in all processes. As described above, an iron component can form a complex with<br>
Compound (I) particularly when pH is between 5 and 7. It is therefore favorable to use water<br>
containing a very small amount of iron components particularly in the process where pH<br>
control is difficult. Thus, use of a solvent, such as water, containing a very small amount of<br>
iron components is preferred in the reaction process for producing Compound (I) and/or in<br>
the purification process for removing compounds, other than Compound (I), from the<br>
reaction mixture containing Compound (I). In the present invention, "an amount of iron<br>
components contained" refers to a content of iron, iron compounds and iron ions (including<br>
ions with iron atoms) in water used and the like. These iron components, in the form existing<br>
in water and the like or reacting with acids or alkalis to become iron ions or ions containing<br>
iron atoms, can form colored complexes with Compound (I).<br>
Examples of methods for obtaining a solvent containing 0.05 ppm or less of iron<br>
components include known methods in the art, such as, in the case of water, distillation of<br>
industrial water (distilled water), and purification of industrial water through columns filled<br>
with substances having a function to catch iron components, such as ion exchange resins<br>
(water passed through a water purifier, ion exchanged water and the like). An amount of iron<br>
components contained in water can be measured with such measuring equipment as UV or<br>
visible light spectrophotometer, inductively coupled high-frequency plasma-atomic emission<br>
spectroscope, atomic absorption analyzer, photoelectric photometer and colorimeter.<br>
The present invention is characterized in production of Compound (I) using<br>
reaction or purification tanks with corrosion-resistant layers on the inner walls (which may<br>
hereinafter refer to as "Tanks"). It is preferable to use tanks with corrosion-resistant layers<br>
throughout the production processes. However, it is not always necessary to use them in all<br>
processes. It is efficient to use Tanks when there is a risk of elution of iron components and<br>
the like, which cause coloring of Compound (I), from a tank into the solution due to corrosion.<br>
It is therefore preferable to use reaction tanks with corrosion-resistant layers in the reaction<br>
process for producing Compound (I) and/or in the purification process for removing<br>
compounds, other than Compound (I), from the reaction mixture containing Compound (I).<br>
There are no particular restrictions on materials used for the corrosion-resistant<br>
layers, if they are not corroded with acids, such as sulfuric acid, or alkalis, such as sodium<br>
hydroxide, used in the reaction or purification process.<br>
Examples of corrosion-resistant materials include corrosion-resistant metals such<br>
as titanium, zirconium, tantalum, niobium and nickel; glasses such as borosilicate glass,<br>
neutral glass, quartz glass and alkali-resistant glass; inorganic materials such as enamel;<br>
organic materials including fluorine resins such as ethylene tetrafluoride resins (PTFE or<br>
TFE), ethylene tetrafluoride-perfluoroalkoxy vinyl ether copolymers (PFA), ethylene<br>
tetrafluoride-propylene hexafluoride copolymers (FEP), polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE),<br>
ethylene tetrafluoride-ethylene copolymers (ETFE), chlorotrifluoroethylene-ethylene<br>
copolymers (ECTFE), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and polyvinyl fluoride (PVF).<br>
An example of a method for forming a corrosion-resistant layer on the inner wall is<br>
lining or coating of a corrosion-resistant material on the inner wall. As for methods for lining<br>
or coating, when a glass is used, an example is glass lining that a vitreous glaze is baked on<br>
the surface of the base material (steel plate) composing the tank. When a fluorine resin is<br>
used, coating by baking a powder and sheet lining using a glass cloth are exemplified. Of<br>
them, a tank whose inner wall is lined or coated with a glass or fluorine resin is preferably<br>
used from the viewpoint of heat resistance, durability and others. It is more favorable to use<br>
a tank with the inner wall lined with a glass (commonly known as GL).<br>
In the present invention, any of the following methods are applicable: (a) a reaction<br>
is carried out in an SUS tank as before, using water with a content of iron components of<br>
0.05 ppm or less as a reaction solvent and/or purification solvent; (b) a reaction is carried<br>
out in a tank with a corrosion-resistant layer on the inner wall, using industrial water as<br>
before; or (c) water containing 0.05 ppm or less of iron components is used as a reaction<br>
solvent and/or a purification solvent and a tank with a corrosion-resistant layer on the inner<br>
wall also used. The method (c) is particularly preferred from the viewpoint of production of<br>
non-colored, highly pure diphenyl sulfone compounds more securely.<br>
The reaction mixture may be colored in the purification process for removing<br>
compounds, other than Compound (I), from the reaction mixture containing Compound (I).<br>
This is considered to occur because metal ions including iron ions, nickel ions and<br>
chromium ions, that dissolve out from an SUS reaction vessel, which is usually used as a<br>
reaction vessel, in the process for reacting Compound (II), such as BPS, with Compound<br>
(III), or that are contained in a very small amount in water (industrial water) used in the<br>
process for purifying the reaction mixture, combine with phenolic compounds, such as<br>
Compound (I), to form complexes, which color the reaction solution. It is difficult to decolor<br>
the solution, once colored, even if purified repeatedly afterward. Because of this, in the<br>
present invention, a chelating agent is added to the reaction mixture in the process for<br>
purifying the reaction mixture, and captures the metal ions by chelation for preventing the<br>
coloring.<br>
There are no particular restrictions on chelating agents used, if they are<br>
compounds to bind with metal ions to form chelates. Actual examples include compounds<br>
obtained from reactions of compounds having amino groups, such as ammonia, polyamine<br>
and amino acids, with carbon disulfide, halogenated carboxylic acids, halogenated alcohols<br>
and the like; and salts of these compounds; and dithiocarbamates; dimethylglyoxime;<br>
dithizone, bipyridine and phenanthroline.<br>
Examples of the said polyamines include ethylenediamine, N-<br>
methylethylenediamine, N,N"-dimethylethylenediamine, 1,2-diaminopropane, 1,3-<br>
diaminopropane, diethylenetriamine, thethylenetetramine, tetramethylenepentamine and<br>
pentamethylenehexamine.<br>
Examples of halogenated carboxylic acids include monochloroacetic acid,<br>
monobromoacetic acid, monoiodoacetic acid, 1-chloropropionicacid, 2-chloropropionicacid,<br>
1-bromopropionic acid and 2-bromopropionic acid.<br>
Examples of halogenated alcohols include 1-chloroethanol, 2-chloroethanol, 1-<br>
bromoethanol, 2-bromoethanol, 1-chloropropanol, 2-chloropropanol, 2-chloroisopropanol,<br>
3-chloropropanol, 1-bromopropanol, 2-bromopropanol, 2-bromoisopropanol and 3-<br>
bromopropanol.<br>
Actual examples of chelating agents include dithiocarbamates such as sodium<br>
dithiocarbamate and potassium dithiocarbamate; acetic acid derivatives of amines such as<br>
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), hydroxyethyliminodiacetic acid (HIDA),<br>
nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), hydroxyethylethylenediaminetriacetic acid (HEDTA),<br>
diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTHA) and triethylenetetraminehexaacetic acid<br>
(TTHA); and salts of these acetic acid derivatives (for example, alkali metal salts such as<br>
sodium and potassium; alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium; and<br>
ammonium salts); ethanolamines such as ethanolamine, N,N"-bis(2-<br>
hydroxyethyl)ethylenediamine, N,N",N""-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediamine and<br>
dihydroxyethylglycine (DHEG); salts of dithiocarbamic acid derivatives of polyamines such<br>
as N,N"-bis(dithiocarboxy)ethylenediamine sodium salt, N,N"-<br>
bis(dithiocarboxy)ethylenediamine potassium salt, N,N-<br>
bis(dithiocarboxy)trimethylenediamine sodium salt, N,N"-<br>
bis(dithiocarboxy)trimethylenediamine potassium salt, N,N"-<br>
bis(dithiocarboxy)diethylenetriamine sodium salt, N,N"-bis(dithiocarboxy)diethylenetriamine<br>
potassium salt, N,N",N"-tris(dithiocarboxy)diethylenetriamine sodium salt, N,N",N"-<br>
tris(dithiocarboxy)diethylenetriamine potassium salt, N,N"-<br>
bis(dithiocarboxy)triethylenetetramine sodium salt, N,N"-<br>
bis(dithiocarboxy)triethylenetetramine potassium salt, N,N",N"-<br>
tris(dithiocarboxy)triethylenetetramine sodium salt and N,N",N"-<br>
tris(dithiocarboxy)triethylenetetramine potassium salt; dimethylglyoxime, dithizone,<br>
bipyridine and phenanthroline.<br>
Of these chelating agents, preferred are cheltating agents forming water-soluble<br>
chelates (water-soluble chelating agents) represented by chelating agents obtained by<br>
reacting ammonia or polyamine with halogenated carboxylic acids and/or halogenated<br>
alcohols; and salts of these agents. Use of EDTA or its salts is particularly preferred<br>
because of easy acquisition, handling, easy separation and the like.<br>
Examples of EDTA salts include EDTA disodium salt, EDTA trisodium salt, EDTA<br>
tetrasodium salt, EDTA dipotassium salt, EDTA tripotassium salt, EDTA tetrapotassium salt,<br>
EDTA calcium salt, EDTA tricalcium salt, EDTA diammonium salt and EDTA magnesium<br>
dipotassium salt. When a water-soluble chelating agent is added to the reaction mixture, the<br>
chelates produced are water-soluble and are not taken in the crystals of 4,4"-<br>
dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone. Thus, the target compound that is completely decolored is<br>
produced.<br>
A chelating agent can be added at any one of the following stages: (a) after the<br>
completion of the reaction and before the removal of unreacted Compound (III), (b) after the<br>
removal of Compound (III) and before the removal of 4,4"-dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone<br>
diethers, (c) after the removal of 4,4"-dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone diethers and before the<br>
removal of unreacted Compound (II) with pH adjustments, and (d) after the removal of<br>
unreacted Compound (II) with pH adjustments. Of them, (d) is preferred, that is, a chelating<br>
agent is added after pH is adjusted to remove unreacted Compound (II). An addition of a<br>
water-soluble chelating agent at the same time when water is added to the reaction mixture<br>
is particularly preferred because metal ions in water are chelated to form water-soluble<br>
chelates for easy separation. A chelating agent can be added over several times, if required.<br>
A chelating agent is usually used in an aqueous solution. An addition amount of the agent<br>
may be determined properly depending on the content of metal ions, such as iron ion, nickel<br>
ion and chromium ion, in the reaction mixture. If an amount of a chelating agent added is too<br>
small, a coloring prevention effect by the addition of the chelating agent is unsatisfactory. On<br>
the other hand, if the agent is added too much, the coloring prevention effect is satisfactory<br>
but an excessive amount of the chelating agent may be mixed in the final product of<br>
Compound (I) as an impurity. It is therefore favorable to measure a concentration of metal<br>
ions contained in the reaction mixture by a known method before the agent is added, and<br>
then add an amount of chelating agent corresponding to the concentration of metal ions. An<br>
addition amount of a chelating agent is usually from 0.0001 to 0.5 parts by weight, preferably<br>
from 0.001 to 0.1 parts by weight, to 100 parts by weight of the reaction mixture.<br>
The inventions relating to the aforementioned (Composition 7), (Composition 15),<br>
(Composition 18), (Composition 24), (Composition 26), (Composition 27), (Composition 28)<br>
and (Composition 31) are favorably used as methods to produce Compound (I) that has a b<br>
value of 2.5 or less when measured by a color difference meter or that is visually white.<br>
Compound (I) is preferably whiter as a product when used as a developer. Production<br>
methods of the prior art have a problem of impossibility to supply such a product stably. The<br>
problem is solved with use of the methods of the present invention.<br>
Best Forms to Implement the Invention:<br>
The present invention is described in detail in reference to Examples. The present<br>
invention is not limited to the following examples. Compound (II), types of solvents, types of<br>
tanks used in the reaction and purification processes and other conditions can be changed<br>
at discretion as long as they are not deviated from the points of the invention.<br>
Distilled water was used in Reference Example 1, Examples 1 to 3 and<br>
Comparative Examples 1 to 4. The content of metal ions in the distilled water, measured by<br>
an inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscope, was 0.05 ppm or less.<br>
In Reference Example 1, Examples 1 to 3 and Comparative Examples 1 to 4, tanks<br>
with the inner walls lined with glass (hereinafter referred to as GL tanks) were used as<br>
reaction and purification tanks.<br>
Reference Example 1<br><br>
450g of 4,4"-dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone (BPS), 255 ml of a 48% aqueous solution of<br>
sodium hydroxide and 120 ml of water were placed in a reaction tank, and mixed with<br>

and had a b value of 2.5 or less when measured by a color-difference meter (made by<br>
Nippon Denshoku Kogyo Co., Ltd, Model: 1001 DP). No coloring was observed.<br>
Comparative Example 6 [Comparative Example against Example 5]<br>
Example 5 was repeated to give 368.0g of 4-isopropoxy-4"-hydroxydiphenyl<br>
sulfone as powder (yield: 70%), except that the operation of adding a 5% aqueous solution<br>
of EDTA disodium salt to the reaction solution was omitted in the purification process.<br>
The obtained 4-isopropoxy-4"-hydroxydiphenyl sulfone was 98% or more in purity,<br>
and had a b value of 4.1 when measured by a color-difference meter (made by Nippon<br>
Denshoku Kogyo Co., Ltd, Model: 1001 DP). It was colored light yellow.<br>
Reference Example 4: Production of the same target compound as that in Reference<br>
Example 2<br>
In a 500-ml, four-neck flask were placed 47.5 ml of water, 25.6g of sodium<br>
hydroxide and 80.0g of 4,4"-dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone and stirred to dissolve at 110 ± 2°C<br>
for 4 hours. 20.34g of bis(2-chloroethyl) ether was added to the resulting solution at 110 to<br>
112°C, and stirred at the same temperature for 8 hours. After the reaction was completed,<br>
108.1 ml of hot water was added to the reaction solution and cooled to 80°C. 167.4 ml of a<br>
90% aqueous methanol solution was added to the resulting solution and stirred for 30<br>
minutes to make the solution homogeneous. Then, 0.5 ml of a 5% aqueous solution of<br>
EDTA disodium salt was added and 116.4g of 10% hydrochloric acid was slowly dropped at<br>
71°C to adjust pH to 4 to 5. The resulting solution was left at 71 °C for an hour, cooled to 25<br>
to 30°C, and further left for 8 hours. The deposited crystals were separated by filtration,<br>
washed with 200 ml of a 50% aqueous methanol solution, and dried to give 63.2g of the<br>
target compound as powder. Yield: 78%.<br>
The target compound was 99% or more in purity, and had a b value of 2.5 or less<br>
when measured by a color-difference meter (made by Nippon Denshoku Kogyo Co., Ltd,<br>
Model: 1001 DP). No coloring was observed.<br>
Reference Example 5<br>
Reference Example 4 was repeated to give 63.2g of the target compound as<br>
powder (yield: 78%), except that the operation of adding a 5% aqueous solution of EDTA<br>
disodium salt to the reaction solution was omitted in the purification process.<br>
The obtained target compound was 98% or more in purity, and had a b value of 4.1<br>
when measured by a color-difference meter (made by Nippon Denshoku Kogyo Co., Ltd,<br>
Model: 1001 DP). It was colored light yellow.<br>
Example 7 [Example for (Composition 32) to (Composition 37)]<br>
577g of 4-isopropoxy-4"-hydroxydiphenyl sulfone, that was crystallized from<br>
toluene and filtrated in the same way as those in Reference Example 1 and Example 1 and<br>
not dried yet, formed a molecular compound with toluene, and had the toluene solvent<br>
attached in addition to the solvation toluene. The 4-isopropoxy-4"-hydroxydiphenyl sulfone<br>
before being dried was heated to dry under reduced pressure with a paddle dryer under the<br>
following operation conditions:<br>
Pressure reduction degree: 60 to 150 mmHg<br>
Heating temperature: 80 to 85°C<br>
Stirring rate: 2 to 3 revolutions/minute<br>
Drying duration: 16 hours<br>
After the compound was dried, 4-isopropoxy-4"-hydroxydiphenyl sulfone contained<br>
0.1% by weight or less of toluene. No block particles were observed. The product was easily<br>
pulverized to fine particles even in the subsequent pulverization process.<br>
Comparative Example 7 [Comparative Example against Example 7]<br>
4-lsopropoxy-4"-hydroxydiphenyl sulfone of the same conditions as those in<br>
Example 7 was heated to dry under the same conditions as those in Example 8, except that<br>
a dryer with heating under reduced pressure without a stirring apparatus was used, instead<br>
of a paddle dryer. After the compound was dried, there were a large amount of block<br>
particles observed. The compound after dried was heavier than that in Example 7. Besides,<br>
it took a long time to pulverize the compound to a particle size preset for the product in the<br>
subsequent pulverization process.<br>
Applicability in Industry:<br>
As described above, the present invention relates to methods for producing 4,4"-<br>
dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone monoethers, in which a non-colored, highly pure target<br>
compound can be efficiently isolated from a mixture that even contains the target compound<br>
and impurities at high concentrations.<br>
4,4"-Dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone monoethers are compounds useful as developers.<br>
The methods of the present invention stably provide products of high quality, having a high<br>
value of use in industry.<br>
