				<td>The present invention relates to a cable car system having a suspension and traction cable, guided around two deflection pulleys, for passenger carrying means, in particular chairs, having a conveyor device, provided at least one of the boarding points, through which device the passengers are brought to the area in which they board the passenger carrying means; having an entrance gate with a central control unit for controlling the ehtrance gate and the conveyor device; and having a signal transducer, trippable by the passage past it of the passenger carrying means, and a speed transducer, by which the speed of the suspension and traction cable is detectable, the output signals of the transducers being carried to the central control unit.<br>
In known cable car systems of this kind, there is a need to open the entrance gate at a moment at which, by means of the conveyor device, the passengers reach the area where they are to board the passenger carrying means, in particular chairs, as soon as the passenger carrying means arrive in that area. The conveyor device is moved at a speed that is substantially slower than that of the passenger carrying means. However, since the passenger carrying means are secured to the suspension and traction<br><br>
cable at irregular intervals, control of the entrance gate must be performed by whichever passenger carrying means is to be used for carrying the passengers just then located in front of the entrance gate.<br>
Since moreover the speed of the suspension and traction cable is not constant but instead varies depending on the technical aspects of the operation, no specific point exists at which the entrance gate must be opened by the passenger carrying means entering the station, to allow the passengers to reach the boarding area at the proper time; instead, the location of this point depends on the speed of the suspension and traction cable or of the passenger carrying means in an area that can extend over a length of about 100 meters, for instance.  The fact that the reaction time of the passengers does not depend on the speed at which the passenger carrying means are moved inside the cable car station must also be taken into account.<br>
Since the point at which the entrance gate must be opened by the passage past it of a passenger carrying means in order to allow the passengers to board may therefore be located outside the cable car station, there is a need to take precautions to assure the necessary synchronization between the speed of the passenger carrying means, the speed of the conveyor device, and the opening of the entrance gate.<br><br>
measuring instrument is provided, by which the distance covered by the passenger carrying means that has tripped the signal transducer is detectable; the entrance gate can be opened by the central control unit as a function of the output signals of the signal transducer and of the measuring instrument, which optionally also acts as a speed transducer.<br>
The measuring instrument is preferably embodied by a pulse transducer.<br>
The signal transducer is preferably located outside the station, and it may be located on a pylon of the cable car system.  In a preferred embodiment, the drive motor of the conveyor device is also controllable from the central control unit.  The measuring instrument may be embodied by a feeler roller that contacts the suspension and traction cable. A speed transducer-may be provided in addition.<br>
In a cable car system in which the cable deflection pulley (2) located in the boarding area is supported by an adjustable clamping carriage, it can also be provided in accordance v.'ith the invention that a oecond sigi'ial transducer, adjustable by the clamping carriage, is provided, which is also trippable by the passage past it of a passenger carrying means and whose output is likewise applied to the central control unit.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a cable car system having a suspension and traction cable, guided around two deflection pulleys, for passenger carrying means, in particular chairs, having a conveyor device, provided at atleast one of the boarding points, through which device the passengers are brought to the area in which they board the passenger carrying means; having an entrance gate with/central control unit for controlling the entrance gate and the conveyor device; having a signal transducer, trippable by the passage past it of the passenger carrying means, and a speed transducer, by which the speed of the suspension and traction cable is detectable, the output signals of the transducers being carried to the central control unit, characterised in that a measuring instrument for detecting a distance traveled by a respective said passenger carrier after having tripped said signal transducer; said central control unit opening said entrance gate as a function of the output signals received from said signal transducer and from said measuring instrument which optionally also acts as a speed transducer.<br>
fef<br>
»<i the subject of invention is described in further detail below terms an></i>
*?<br>
exemplaiy embodiment shown with reference to the accompanying drawing.  The<br>
:i	drawing schematically shows a station of a cable car system according to the<br>
f	present application.<br>
GS*<br><br>
As can be seen from the drawing, the suspension and traction cable 1 passes around a deflection pulley 2 in the cable car station.  Passenger carrying means, such as chairs 11, are secured to the suspension and traction cable 1.  In the area of the suspension and traction cable 1 in which the chairs 11 are to be boarded by the passengers, a conveyor belt 3 is provided, which is driven by a drive motor 31 at a speed that is less than the speed of the suspension and traction cable 1, for instance being one-third of the latter speed.  An entrance gate 4 is associated with the conveyor belt 3, and it must be opened whenever a chair 11 enters the station, to enable the passengers to be pass through the entrance gate 4 and be conveyed on the conveyor belt to the area where they can board the chairs 11. A photoelectric barrier 5 is located in front of the entrance gate 4.<br>
For controlling the entire system, and especially for controlling the entrance gate 4, a central control unit 6 is provided, which is supplied by a plurality of transducers with the data required for the operation.<br><br>
These transducers include a signal transducer 61, whicn is located in the area where the passenger carrying means 11 move and by which a signal is output over a line 61a to the central control unit 6 as soon as a passenger carrying means 11 moves past it.  The signal transducer 61 may be located outside the cable car station, and in particular can be located on a pylon of the cable car system.<br>
A feeler roller 62 is also provided, which contacts the suspension and traction cable 1 and by which pulses are output over a line 62a to the central control unit 6 upon each revolution of the roller.  If a standard roller is used, for instance, then a pulse is output to the central control unit 6 whenever the suspension and traction cable 1 has moved a distance of 75 mm.  As a result, travel measurement is performed by the feeler roller 62.<br>
A roller is also provided which contacts either the suspension and traction cable 1 or the deflection pulley 2 and is thereby rotated, and which forms part of a tachometer generator 63, and as a result the speed of the suspension and traction cable 2 is measured.  The output of this tachometer generator 63, which acts as a speed<br><br>
central control unit 6. A line 5a also leads from the -u^
 <br>
From the central control unit S,   a line 4a leads to the entrance gate 4, and a line 31a leads to the drive motor 31 for the conveyor belt 3.<br>
If moreover the deflection pulley 2 is supported by a clamping carriage which is movable back and forth in the traction direction of the suspension and traction cable 1, then a second signal transducer 64, disposed on this clamping carriage, is provided; it too is activated by a passenger carrying means 11 moving past it, and its output is likewise applied, via a line 64a, to the central control unit 6.<br>
The adjustment of the clamping carriage is effected on the basis of the tension of the suspension and traction cable 1, which depends on climatic conditions, the load on the cable car system, and the stretching of the suspension and traction cable 1.<br>
If the suspension and traction cable 1 is moved at maximum speed, then the entrance gate 4 must be opened whenever the chair 11 has moved a distance XI from the signal transducer 61 to the point B.  As soon as the entrance gate 4 is opened, the passengers, after a reaction time Which is independent of the speed of the suspension and traction cable 1 has elapsed, move over a ramp 41 onto the conveyor belt 3, from which they are moved, at a speed that is reduced compared to the speed of the suspension and<br><br>
traction cable 1, in the direction of the arrow A until the chair has approached them closely enough from behind that they can board it.  The opening of the entrance gate 4 occurs only, however, if passengers are located in front of it, which is monitored by means of the photoelectric barrier 5.<br>
Conversely, if the suspension and traction cable is moving at a lower speed, then the point at which the chair 11 is located when the entrance gate 4 is supposed to be opened is shifted by the distance X2 to a point C.<br>
The distance that has been covered by the chair 11 after passing the first signal transducer 61 is detected by the pulse transducer 62 and is processed in the central control unit 6.  The speed of the suspension and traction cable 1 is indicated by the tachometer generator 63 and is likewise processed in the central control unit 6.  On the basis of these measured values, the opening of the entrance gate 4 and the speed of the conveyor belt 3 are controlled by the central control unit 6 in such a way that the passenger are in the boarding area when the chair 11 reaches that area.<br>
The mode of operation of this -eable car system will now be described in further detail:<br>
As soon as a chair 11 moves past the first signal transducer 61, the latter outputs a signal over the line<br><br>
61a to the central control' unit 6, which causes a travel measurement to be made by the pulse transducer 62 in such a way as to determine the position of this chair 11 at that time.  The central control unit 6 also calculates the particular point B, in the region of the distance X2, which this chair 11 must pass in order for the entrance gate 4, as a function of the speed of the suspension and traction cable 1, which is measured by the tachometer generator 63, to be opened so as to enable the passengers to board this chair 11 in the boarding area of the conveyor belt 3.  As soon as the chair 11 has reached this point, which is determined by the travel measurement performed by the pulse transducer 62, and also as soon as the photoelectric barrier 5 indicates, via the line 5a, that there is at least one passenger in front of the entrance gate, a signal is output by the central control unit 6 over the line 4a to the entrance gate 4, by which this gate is opened.<br>
If the deflection pulley 2 is located on a clamping carriage, by which it is adjustable back and forth in the traction direction of the suspension and traction cable 1, then the passage of a chair 11 past the second signal transducer 64 causes this transducer to output a signal, over the line 6'3a to tho central -control unit 6, by v;hich signal the location of the deflection pulley 2, which can shift over the distance X3, is likewise fed to the central control unit 6, .and as a result this shifting is likewise taken into account in the opening of the entrance gate 4.<br><br>
Because of this arrangement, control of the opening of the entrance gate 4 is accomplished in each case by the specific chair 11 that is to be boarded by the passengers located at that time in front of the entrance gate 4; hence it does not matter what the intervals are at which the chairs 11 are secured to the suspension and traction cable 1.  Furthermore, the speed of the suspension and traction cable 1 and the location of the deflection pulley 2, if the latter is located on a clamping carriage, can be taken into account as well, thereby assuring that the passengers who are to board a particular chair 11 will always have reached the entrance area as soon as that chair 11 arrives and approaches these passengers from behind.<br>
Even if the cable pulley 2 is supported nondisplaceably, it<br>
is expedient to provide the second signal transducer 64,<br>
because it also acts, in cooperation with the first signal<br>
transducer 61 and the pulse transducer 62, to calibrate the<br>
control system by specifying the spacing X4 between the<br>
first signal transducer 61 and the second signal transducer<br>
64.  Since a speed measurement can also be made by means of<br>
the pulse transducer 62, the speed transducer 63 need not<br>
absolutely necessarily bo provided. 	<br><br><br>
