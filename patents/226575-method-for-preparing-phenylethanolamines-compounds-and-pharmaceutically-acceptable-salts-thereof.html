Experiment example<br>
The antagonistic effects of bronchoconstrtriction induced by histamine of the compounds of the present invention were evaluated by isolated guinea pig trachea strips.<br>
Apparatus: polygrapher recorder, strain gauge transducer<br>
Conditions: Krebs-Hensleit solution; gas mixture(95DO2, 5DCO2); Paper speed: 4mm/min; 37°C<br>
Animals: guinea pigs (Harley, purchased from the Experimental Animal Center of China Medical Univesity) of either sex weighting 350-500 g were used.<br>
Reagent: Histmaine phosphate solution(10"6D 10"4M)<br>
Sample:  Depending on their potencies,  the  compounds were tested at the<br>
concentration of 1 0"6 or 3 X 1 0"4M.<br>
Method: Guinea pigs were sacrificed and the trachea strips(2cmx 3mm) were prepared; the preparation was then mounted under a testing tension of 2g in an organ bath containing 10 mL Kebs-Hensleits solution at 3TC and supervised with the gas mixture mentioned above and the preparation was allowed to equilibrate for 2 h before the addition of histamine. When the tension of trachea strips reached 50 % of the maximum contraction, the tested compounds was added to bath, and the antagonistic effect (represented as relaxing rate) was calculated as below: Relaxing rate = (Contraction intensity after histamine addition-Contraction intensity after tested compounds addition)/ Contraction intensity after tested compounds addition X 100D<br>
The relaxing rate of each compound was presented in table 1.<br>
