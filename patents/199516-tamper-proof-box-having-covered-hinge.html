				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION :-<br>
The Invention describes Tamper Proof box having covered hinge. The cover protects traditional hinges to make it invisible. It also make all the screws/rivets used for fixing the hinge invisible. The invention make the fixing arrangement Tamper-Proof. Also with this invension the cover is allowed to be opened by 90°.<br>
PRIOR ART:<br>
Conventionally hinges are used for attaching the lid to the body of a Box. The conventional hinge consists of two panels having a number of hooks spaced apart formed at one end of each panel. The formed hooks on one panel are adapted to inter-engage the hooks formed on the other panel through the intervening spaces among the hooks and are kept in such engaged position by a rod passing through the holes in the hooks. The ends of new rod are then riveted. The hinge so formed, the panels revolve around the rod secured in the holes of the hooks. The said panels have plurality of the holed. One panel of the hinge is fixed to the edge of the lid of the box by means of screws passing through the holes in the panel and similarly the second panel is fixed to the top edge of the body of the box. A number of such hinges are fixed depending upon the size of the box. By so fixing the lid to the body of the box, the lid moves around the hinge to close or open the box as it is desired. The manners in which these hinges are fixed are shown in Figure-1 and 2.<br><br>
PROBLEMS WITH PRIOR ART :<br>
1.	The hinge is visible from outside in both the cases as shown in<br>
Fig. 1 &amp; 2.<br>
2.	The rod of the hinge is subjected to tamper easily making the<br>
hinge non functional, there by defeating its use.<br>
3.	Fig 2 indicate not only the hinge, also the fixing screws are visible.<br>
4.	Being visible from outside, the hinge and screws are liable for<br>
corrosion and chances of being jammed increases.<br>
HOW THIS INVENSION SEEKS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM:<br>
The present invension relates to Tamper Proof box having covered hinge. One side of the hinge is screwed to the box and the other side to the lid, in a manner as to cover both sides of the hinge. The size and location of these covers vary according to the type and size of the lid and hinge. The invented tamper proof box having covered hinge is used by making the lid and box so as to provide proper fixing place for the hinge and covers the hinge by way of extending the cover more than the hinge on its sides.<br>
The shape and size of the housing for hinge as shown in drawings vary depending on the size of the hinge and the lid and box.<br><br>
This invented cover is illustrated in the accompanying drawing wherein:-<br>
Figure 3	Shows the front view of the cover in closed position.<br>
Figure 4	Show's the top view of the cover in closed position.<br>
Figure 5	Shows the cross-section of the cover in closed position.<br>
Figure 6	Shows the cross -section of the cover in open position.<br>
As shown in Fig 5, the hinge "Y" is fixed on the seat provided on the box 'B' and the shape of the cover on the box is made as per the cross-section shown and this cover is slightly bigger than the hinge to provide enough space for movement of the top lid. Also the hinge is not visible from outside. The shape of the top lid is made just to cover the hinge adequately, so that, it is not visible from outside in the closed position. The shape further allows the movement of the lid as shown in Fig 6. The screws are fixed from outside in holes provided in the lid and in the box at the place if seat provided for the hinge. In the closed position, the screws therefore are not visible from outside. Instead of screws for fixing the hinge, the hinge is welded on the lid and box in the case of lid and box made of metals.<br>
This invented cover for hinge, is very convenient, less time consuming to attach internal, non visible and tamper-proof hinge for fixing the lid and the box.<br><br>
Since many apparently different embodiments of the present invension could be made without departing from scope and spirit thereof, it is intended that the description of the invention stated herein be interpreted as being illustration only and limiting in any manner whatsoever.<br>
FEATURES TO ACHIEVE EXISTING PROBLEM SOLVING:-The salient features of the system are:-<br>
The cover which covers the hinge make the hinge invisible. The screws/rivets used in fixing the hinge becomes fully invisible, thus makes the fixing arrangement tamper-proof, with the invented design the cover is opened by 90°. Because of the cover, the screws/rivets do not get rusted, for which the replacement become easy and less time consuming also less costly.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION :-<br>
Accordingly the invention describes a tamper proof box having covered hinge comprising a rectangular base portion having opposed first and second side walls (B) wherein a portion of the said second side wall is molded so as to form two opposed first and second rectangular channel structures (C and D); said second channel (D) having a larger cross-section as compared to the said first channel (C) and a molded portion (E) being provided in the said first channel to accommodate the fastening means.<br><br>
A rectangular lid portion, adapted to be attached to the said rectangular base portion, having opposed first and second end walls and opposed first and second side  walls (A), which are of the same dimensions as that of the rectangular base portion wherein a portion of the said second side wall (A) is molded to form a ']' shaped structure (G) which has a molded portion (F) to accommodate the fastening means.<br>
Wherein a hinge member (Y) is attached to the rectangular base portion as well as to the rectangular lid portion by means of fastening members, which are accommodated in the said molded portion (E and F) and wherein the position of the hinge (Y) is so adjusted that the hinge remains covered under the ']' shaped molded structure thus being invisible and secured.<br>
Whereby when the said lid portion is operated the molded ']' shaped structure moves easily inside the said second channel (D) opening the rectangular base portion.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
I Claim<br>
1. A tamper proof box having covered hinge comprising<br>
a rectangular base portion having opposed first and second end walls and opposed first and second side walls (B) wherein a portion of the said second side wall is molded so as to form two opposed first and second rectangular channel structures (C and D); said second channel (D) having a larger cross-section as compared to the said first channel (C) and a molded portion (E) being provided in the said first channel to accommodate the fastening means;<br>
$, rectangular lid portion, adapted to be attached to the said rectangular base portion, having opposed first and second end walls and opposed first and second side walls (A), which are of the same dimensions as that of the rectangular base portion wherein a portion of the said second side wall (A) is molded to form a 'J' shaped structure (G) which has a molded portion (F) to accommodate the fastening means;<br>
wherein a hinge member (Y) is attached to the rectangular base portion as well as to the rectangular lid portion by means of fastening members, which are accommodated in the said molded portion (E and F) and wherein the position of the hinge (Y) is so adjusted that the hinge remains covered under the 'J' shaped molded structure thus being invisible and secured.<br><br>
Whereby when the said lid portion is operated the molded 'J' shaped structure moves easily inside the said second channel (D) opening the rectangular base portion.<br>
2.	A tamper proof box as claimed in claim 1 wherein the fastening<br>
means can be screw or rivets.<br>
3.	A tamper proof box as claimed in claim 1, wherein the lid can be<br>
opened by 90 °.<br>
4.	A tamper proof box as claimed in claim 1, wherein the said hinge<br>
