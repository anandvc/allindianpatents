Field of Invention:<br>
The present invention relates generally to an implant of use in medicine dentistny &amp; related field. More particularly, the present invention relates to implants with internal / external appendages which aid and enhance the retention of the implant.<br>
Description of the related art:<br>
At the outset of the description which follows it is to be understood that ensuring description only illustrate a particular embodiment of this invention. However, such particular form is only an exemplary embodiment, and without intending to imply any limitation on the scope of this invention. Accordingly, the description is to be understood as an exemplary embodiment and reading of the invention is not intended to be taken restrictively.<br>
The instant invention is a variant of conventional hard tissue implants used in the medical and related fields. The design is unique in that the body of the implant is hollow and contains many mechanical/electronic, electrical equipments which function to move, drill out spikes that resemble may screws thus aiding in retention, anchorage of the entire structure.<br>
The foregoing description outlined rather brpadly preferred and alternative features of the present invention so that those skilled in the art may better understand the detailed description of the invention that follows. Additional features of the invention will be described hereinafter that form the subject of claims of the mvention. Those skilled in the art should appreciate that they can readily use the disclosed conception and specific embodiment as a basis for designing and modifying other structures for carrying out the same purposes of the present invention. Those skilled in the art should realize such equivalent conception do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention in its broadest form.<br>
Most implant systems, as for example, threaded, non-threaded, surface-coated use their surface morphology to enhance retention. These surface coatings help the implant to integrate with the bone thoroughly and produce an indistinguishable zone of demarcation. Most implants contain a solid cylindrical body with one end rounded and the other modified to accept a super structure or any component the operator intends to add.<br>
Recently many implant designs like surface coating, threading, retentive holes for bone to grow have been proposed to enhance the clinical performance of the material.<br><br>
Threaded implants have inclined planes incorporated to the surface of the body so that they resemble a screw. Such implants are directly driven into the hole of a lesser diameter in the bone. Since the implants are driven into the bone against resistance, retention is improved.<br>
Description of the drawings:<br>
The invention relates, in one embodiment to an implant with retentive spikes that are usually positioned internally and are capable of moving out with or without rotating during or after placement with the help of electronic, electrical, mechanical components.<br>
The invention relates, in one embodiment, the intemal components of an implant that are capable of moving / rotating out with the help of precise mechanical, electrical, electronic components.<br>

Fig.2 is a perspective diagram showing the extemal surface of a threaded implant.<br>
Fig.3 is a perspective diagram showing the cross-sectional view of the newly designed implant with spikes.<br>
Fig.l is a perspective diagram showing the extemal surface of the structure of an ordinary surface coated implant. The main components of the implant are as follows:<br>
B        -	Cylindrical body<br>
R        -	Rounded end<br>
A        -	Attachment end<br>
Fig.2 is a perspective digram showing the extemal surface of a threaded implant. T is a threaded surface indicated therein.<br>
Fig.3 is a perspective diagram showing the cross-sectional view of the newly designed implant with spikes.<br>

2	-	a group of gear systems<br>
3	-	two secondary screw '3' (spikes)<br>
B	-	Body of the implant<br>
R        -	Round end of the implant<br>
A        -	Attachment end<br><br>
Fig.l is a perspective diagram of a well known commercially available implant. It contains a cylindrical body 'B', a rounded end 'R' and attachment end 'A' which is used to attach the implant to other components. Before placing the implant, a hole of a similar or slightly varied diameter is drilled in the bone at the placement site. The implant is always placed such that the rounded end enters the bone. The implant is inserted by physically tapping it into the hole.<br>
Fig.l depicts an implant to the threaded surface T' These implants offer superior retention due to increased surface area as well as a mechanical inter-locking between the implant threads and the bone.<br>
Fig.3 depicts an implant following my design principles but considering the norms of the dimensions and choice of material followed in the previously described implants. The specialty of this implant is that it has internal moving components that will move out during or after placement. Fig.3 shows the cross-sectional view of the newly designed implant with an internal primary screw T, a group of gear system '2\ which arc related to the primary screw 'r. These gear systems are in turn attached to two secondary screw '3' facing different or similar directions. Activation of the primary screw 'T is transferred to secondary screw '3' through the gear system '2\ The location of the secondary screw in relation to the internal primary screw or the extemal surface of the implant body may be widely varied.<br>
