				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates, in general, to an apparatus for fixing a steel wire of a<br>
wale and, more particularly, to an apparatus for fixing a steel wire of a wale, which has<br>
a simple structure and can fix a steel wire of a prestressed wale such that the wire can<br>
be securely reinforced during pit excavation work for constructing an underground<br>
structure.<br>
Background Art<br>
During conventional pit excavation work for constructing an underground railway<br>
or the basement of a building, the ground is dug in a predetermined area to a pre-<br>
determined depth to excavate a pit, and a desired number of vertical piles are installed<br>
in the pit.<br>
After the installation of the vertical piles in the pit, part of the pit is further dug and,<br>
thereafter, H-beams and lining boards are installed in the pit.<br>
After the installation of the lining boards in the pit, work for constructing the un-<br>
derground railway or the basement of the building progresses through continuous<br>
excavation, and the repeated installation of bracing beams accompanies the repeated<br>
excavation.<br>
Thus, to construct such a temporary facility, both the soil pressure and the load that<br>
may be applied to bracing beams at every excavation step must be repeatedly<br>
calculated, and bracing beams are installed in the pit such that the beams can ef-<br>
fectively resist both the calculated maximum soil pressure and the calculated<br>
maximum load.<br>
However, the above-mentioned conventional designing and constructing technique<br>
for making underground structures requires an excessive number of bracing beams<br>
such that the bracing beams must be densely installed in a pit with a narrow interval of<br>
about 2-3 meters between the beams. Such densely installed bracing beams undesirably<br>
impede the movement of construction materials in the pit and prevent construction<br>
vehicles from moving in the pit, thus hindering the construction work. Furthermore,<br>
the densely installed bracing beams impede both form work and reinforcement work<br>
during the process of constructing the underground structure, and undesirably form a<br>
plurality of holes in the finished underground structure, thus seriously reducing the wa-<br>
terproofing properties of the underground structure.<br>
As a technique for forming a temporary facility without using the bracing beams<br>
while constructing an underground structure, a construction technique for supporting<br><br>
steel piles using earth anchors has been proposed. In this technique, an inclined hole is<br>
formed in the ground behind each steel pipe, and a steel wire or a steel bar is inserted<br>
into the inclined hole. Thereafter, the end of the steel wire or the steel bar, inserted into<br>
the inclined hole, is fixed through a mechanical method or a chemical method using<br>
epoxy or cement grout. The fixed steel wire or the fixed steel bar is tensioned to fix the<br>
steel pile.<br>
The temporary facility constructed through the above-mentioned technique using<br>
earth anchors provides sufficient inner space therein, thereby solving the difficulties<br>
experienced in the related art.<br>
However, the technique using earth anchors is problematic in that, if the technique<br>
is used in a busy city, the area influenced by the construction work may include private<br>
land around the construction site, thus incurring the enmity of the people. Another<br>
problem with the technique resides in that it increases construction expenses.<br>
Korean Utility Model Registration No. 20-258949 discloses a technique for con-<br>
structing a temporary facility using a truss system without using bracing beams that<br>
conventionally cross the center of an excavated section. The technique may be ef-<br>
ficiently used while executing work for constructing a shallow facility. To construct a<br>
temporary facility using the technique, H-beams are doubly placed at a location<br>
adjacent to the ground surface, thus forming a lattice structure. The lattice structure is<br>
reinforced using vertical beams and raker beams, so that the lattice structure can resist<br>
soil pressure using a double-layered upper truss.<br>
The technique using the truss system while constructing a temporary facility for<br>
supporting the ground was proposed in an attempt to overcome the problems ac-<br>
companying the conventional techniques using bracing beams during pit excavation<br>
and construction of underground structures. The technique may be efficiently used in<br>
the case of installing a wide structure in the lower part of an excavated pit and<br>
installing a narrow structure in the upper part of the pit.<br>
Korean Patent No. 10-188465, Korean Utility Model Registration No. 20-247053<br>
and Japanese Patent No. 837994 disclose techniques for reinforcing wales through pre-<br>
stressing. Each of the techniques increases the interval between the bracing beams by<br>
installing a wale on a previously installed wale and by tensioning a steel wire. One of<br>
the above-mentioned techniques uses an additional wale, while the other technique<br>
reinforces the flanges of conventional H-beams.<br>
The above-mentioned techniques are advantageous in that the interval between the<br>
bracing beams can be increased. However, in the technique, steel wires are rec-<br>
tilinearly arranged, thus a negative moment is generated in the steel wires, unlike the<br>
parabolic distribution of moment generated in a wale due to soil pressure. In other<br>
words, the distribution of moment generated in the wale is different from the dis-<br><br>
tribution of load-induced moment, so that the length of the reinforced wale is un-<br>
desirably limited.<br>
In the above-mentioned conventional techniques, a steel wire is fixed at the end of a<br>
prestressed wale, so that the curved section of the steel wire cannot be extended long.<br>
Thus, the steel wire may be angled and become weak at the angled part. Furthermore,<br>
the arc-shaped curve of the tension moment, which varies in different locations along<br>
the steel wire, becomes short, thus failing to realize sufficient force.<br>
Further, the wale does not have sufficient strength at parts on which both the<br>
compressive force and the tensile force are applied as the wale is loaded. The wale may<br>
be structurally frail, thus being easily bent. Further, the fixed state of the steel wire<br>
may be broken.<br>
In the conventional techniques, bracing beams or struts are installed in an excavated<br>
planar structure so as to fix both a braced wall and corners around the braced wall.<br>
Furthermore, steel materials are used to withstand soil pressure at the corners, thus<br>
wasting materials and increasing construction expenses. The steel material reduces the<br>
space in the excavated planar structure, thus reducing work efficiency when tensioning<br>
steel wires after fixing the steel wires of the prestressed wale.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
Accordingly, the present invention has been made keeping in mind the above<br>
problems occurring in the related art, and an object of the present invention is to<br>
provide an apparatus for fixing a steel wire of a wale, which has a simple structure and<br>
can fix a steel wire of a prestressed wale such that the wire can be arranged long due to<br>
the simple structure of the apparatus, thus enabling the wale to sufficiently resist soil<br>
pressure and to be highly reinforced at parts thereof receiving high compressive force<br>
and high tensile force, during pit excavation work for constructing an underground<br>
structure.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
In order to accomplish the above object, in an aspect, the present invention provides<br>
an apparatus for fixing a steel wire of a wale, comprising: a fixing body having a cross<br>
beam shape, the fixing body being integrated at a first end thereof with an end of a<br>
prestressed wale, with a coupling hole formed in the fixing body so as to allow an end<br>
of the steel wire of the wale to pass through the coupling hole; and a head block<br>
provided on a second end of the fixing body and fixing the end of the steel wire of the<br>
wale.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides an apparatus for fixing steel wires<br>
of a wale, comprising: a cross beam integrated with a prestressed wale; a compression<br><br>
beam mounted at an incline to one end of the cross beam, with at least one corner<br>
bracing beam mounted at an incline to the compression beam; a raker beam installed at<br>
an incline to connect ends of the cross beam and the compression beam to each other;<br>
first and second head blocks provided inside a triangle formed by the compression<br>
beam, the raker beam and the cross beam such that the first and second head blocks are<br>
spaced apart from each other and separately fix and tension steel wires going into the<br>
triangle.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
The fixing apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention has an<br>
improved structure capable of fixing the steel wire of a prestressed wale at a location<br>
spaced apart from one end of the wale during pit excavation work for constructing an<br>
underground structure. The fixing apparatus prevents a sharp angle from being formed<br>
in the steel wire, and instead allows the steel wire to extend in the form of an arc shape,<br>
thus securing sufficient moment. Furthermore, the fixing apparatus provides strong re-<br>
inforcement of parts to which high compressive force and high tensile force are<br>
applied.<br>
The fixing apparatus according to another embodiment of the present invention has<br>
an improved structure capable of supporting a bracing beam and fixing and tensioning<br>
a steel wire in the bracing beam at a corner during pit excavation work for constructing<br>
an underground structure. At the corner, the fixing apparatus forms a triangular<br>
structure which can stably support the bracing beam and can fix and tension the steel<br>
wire at the same time, thus improving work efficiency when executing the pit<br>
excavation work. Further, the fixing apparatus has a simple structure, thus reducing the<br>
consumption of materials and reducing construction expenses. Further, to prevent the<br>
dense arrangement of bracing beams at corners and prevent a reduction in space, the<br>
fixing apparatus withstands soil pressure using the tensile force of the steel wire, thus<br>
enlarging the work space and improving the efficiency of use of space.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Herein below, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in<br>
detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
[Embodiment 1]<br>
With reference to FIG. 1 through FIG. 3, the apparatus for fixing a steel wire of a<br>
wale according to the first embodiment of the present invention comprises a<br>
prestressed wale 20 which is integrally formed in front of a braced wall 10 and has a<br>
tensile force for tensioning a steel wire 22, a fixing body 200 bolted at a first end<br>
thereof to an end of the wale 20 and having a coupling hole 202 for allowing the steel<br>
wire 22 to pass through the coupling hole 202, a head block 400 provided on a second<br>
end of the fixing body 200 and fixing the end of the steel wire 22, which has been<br>
inserted into the head block 400, and a wire support 300 which protrudes from the<br>
front surface of the fixing body 200 and supports the steel wire 22 at an incline.<br>
Described in detail, the fixing body 200 is constructed in the form of a beam which<br>
is integrated with and extends from the end of the wale 20, and preferably uses a con-<br>
ventional H-beam.<br>
When an H-beam is used as the fixing body 200, it is necessary to reinforce the<br>
flange of the beam having the coupling hole 202, so that a reinforcing plate 206 is<br>
mounted to the inner surface of the flange through welding or bolting.<br>
Further, to secure reinforcement against shear stress generated in the fixing body<br>
200 during the process of fixing the steel wire 22, a stopper 250 protrudes from the<br>
front surface of the fixing body 200.<br>
The stopper 250 may be configured in any of various shapes that are capable of<br>
providing reinforcement against shear force. For example, the stopper 250 may be<br>
configured as a horizontal structure which is parallel to the fixing body 200 and<br>
provides a wide reinforcing surface on the front surface of the fixing body 200.<br>
Further, to secure reinforcement on the inner surface of the fixing body 200, at least<br>
one stiffener 260 is integrally provided on the inner surface through welding. The first<br>
end of the fixing body 200, which is combined with the end of the wale 20, is provided<br>
with an end plate 270 through welding, so that the fixing body 200 can be efficiently<br><br>
combined with the wale 20.<br>
Further, a guide plate 220 having a predetermined curvature is integrated on the<br>
inner surface of the fixing body 200, and guides the insertion of the steel wire 22 into<br>
the fixing body 200.<br>
The wire support 300 may be configured as a single body which is mounted at a<br>
first end thereof to the front surface of the fixing body 200 using a bolt, and is rounded<br>
at a second end thereof such that the second end can support the steel wire 22 and be in<br>
contact with the steel wire 22. Alternately, the wire support 300 may be configured as<br>
a plurality of bodies which comprise a first body integrated with the fixing body 200<br>
and a second body for supporting the steel wire 22.<br>
More preferably, the second end of the wire support 300 is configured such that the<br>
wire contact part of the second end is divided into several parts to form a slit end<br>
capable of supporting a plurality of steel wires 22 while preventing the steel wires 22<br>
from becoming tangled or twisted.<br>
A box-shaped protective cap 450 having an open end is preferably provided in the<br>
fixing apparatus. The protective cap 450 is combined with the second end of the fixing<br>
body 200 and covers both the head block 400 and the fixed steel wire 22. Thus, the<br>
protective cap 450 protects the wire fixing head block 400 from external shocks.<br>
The fixing apparatus having the above-mentioned construction according to the first<br>
embodiment of the present invention will be operated as follows.<br>
In the fixing apparatus according to the first embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the first end of the fixing body 200 is combined with the end of the wale 20, such that<br>
the fixing body 200 extends in a horizontal direction from the end of the wale 20.<br>
Thus, the fixing apparatus can fix the end of the steel wire 22 of the prestressed wale<br>
20 to the fixing body 200 instead of the end of the wale 20, so that the fixed steel wire<br>
22 can maintain an arc-shaped curve.<br>
Thus, the fixing apparatus prevents a sharp angle from being formed in the steel<br>
wire 22 and increases the length of the steel wire 22, thereby increasing the prestressed<br>
moment of the steel wire 22.<br>
After the fixing body 200 has been combined with the end of the wale 20, the steel<br>
wire 22 is guided to and passes over the rounded second end of the wire support 300.<br>
Thereafter, the steel wire 22, guided by the wire support 300, enters the fixing body<br>
200 through the coupling hole and comes into contact with the guide plate 220 having<br>
the predetermined curvature. The steel wire 22 enters the head block 400 and is<br>
tensioned using a separate tensioning device before the steel wire 22 is fixed to the<br>
head block 400.<br>
Thereafter, to lock the steel wire 22 fixed to the head block 400, the second end of<br>
the fixing body 200 is covered with the protective cap 450, so that the head block 400<br><br>
can be protected from external shocks.<br>
In the present invention, the stiffener 260, the guide plate 220 and the stopper 250<br>
of the fixing body 200 may be integrated into a single body through welding.<br>
However, the stiffener 260, the guide plate 220 and the stopper 250 of the fixing body<br>
200 may be designed as a single structure when designing H-beams and integrally<br>
formed as a single structure during a process of molding H-beams.<br>
The steel wire 22 fixed to the head block 400 imposes tensile force both on the wale<br>
20 and on the fixing body 200, thus enabling both the wale 20 and the fixing body 200<br>
to sufficiently resist the soil pressure.<br>
In other words, the present invention fixes the steel wire 22 of the wale 20 to a<br>
location beyond the end of the wale 20, thus preventing a sharp angle from being<br>
formed in the steel wire 22 and giving the steel wire 22 a sufficient tensile moment.<br>
FIG. 4 and FIG. 5 show another shape (plate shape or H-beam shape) of the stopper<br>
250 of the present invention. The drawings illustrate that, if a stopper 250 having one<br>
of various shapes is provided on the front surface of the fixing body 200 to protrude<br>
from the front surface, the stopper 250, regardless of the shape thereof, can secure<br>
desired durability of the fixing body 200, and enables the fixing body 200 to resist<br>
shear stress generated therein when fixing the steel wire 22.<br>
[Embodiment 2]<br>
The apparatus for fixing a steel wire of a wale according to the second embodiment<br>
of the present invention will be described herein below with reference to FIG. 6<br>
through FIG. 10. The fixing apparatus comprises a cross beam 610 which is connected<br>
to an end of the wale 520 for supporting a braced wall 510. A compression beam 620 is<br>
connected at an incline to one end of the cross beam 610, and is integrated with at least<br>
one bracing beam 550. A raker beam 630 is connected at an incline both to one end of<br>
the compression beam 620 and to one end of the cross beam 610, thus connecting the<br>
beams 610 and 620 to each other. A coupling hole 632 is formed in the raker beam 630<br>
at a location adjacent to the wale 520 and allows a steel wire 522 of the wale 520 to<br>
enter the hole 632. First and second head blocks 710 and 720 are separately provided<br>
in a triangle formed by the compression beam 620, the raker beam 630 and the cross<br>
beam 610 such that the first and second head blocks 710 and 720 separately fix and<br>
tension steel wires 522.<br>
Described in detail, the cross beam 610, the compression beam 620 and the raker<br>
beam 630 are connected to each other and form a triangular support structure. Each of<br>
the cross beam 610, the compression beam 620 and the raker beam 630 may use an H-<br>
beam having flanges and a web, with at least one stiffener 650 integrated with the inner<br>
surface of the H-beam through welding for reinforcement.<br>
The cross beam 610, the compression beam 620 and the raker beam 630 connect the<br><br>
bracing beam 550 to the wale 520, and form a triangular support structure that stably<br>
resists the compressive force applied both by the bracing beam 550 and by the wale<br>
520.<br>
The ends of both the compression beam 620 and the raker beam 630 are preferably<br>
connected to each other at a right angle. However, it should be understood that the<br>
compression beam 620 and the raker beam 630 can be connected to each other at an<br>
acute angle or at an obtuse angle.<br>
The compression beam 620 is connected to the bracing beam 550 so as to transmit<br>
the compressive force, while the cross beam 610 is integrally connected to the wale<br>
520. Thus, a reinforcing plate 810 is preferably provided in a corner junction between<br>
the cross beam 610 and the compression beam 620.<br>
Further, a preloading jack (not shown), having a cylinder actuator and transmitting<br>
the compressive force, is preferably provided in the center of the bracing beam 550.<br>
The triangular fixing apparatus is provided on an end of the wale 520 at each corner, so<br>
that the fixing apparatus enables the wale to withstand the soil pressure using the<br>
tensile force of the steel wire. The bracing beam 550 is preferably connected to the<br>
compression beams 620 of opposite fixing apparatuses, so that the compressive force<br>
applied by the preloading jack can be transmitted to the braced wall.<br>
Further, an end plate 614 is preferably combined through welding with the first end<br>
of the cross beam 610 that is connected to the end of the wale 520, so that the cross<br>
beam 610 can be more securely connected to the wale 520.<br>
A guide plate 900 having a predetermined curvature is integrated with the inner<br>
surface of the raker beam 630 and guides the entrance of the steel wire 522 into the<br>
raker beam 630. The guide plate 900 has a structure that is slid along the inner surface<br>
of the raker beam 630 by a lifting jack 950.<br>
The lifting jack 950 preferably incorporates a screw jack. When a screw jack is used<br>
as the lifting jack 950, the first end of the lifting jack 950 is integrated with one end of<br>
the guide plate 900, thus enabling the guide plate 900 to be operated in conjunction<br>
with the lifting jack 950. The second end of the lifting jack 950 is mounted to a<br>
mounting plate 955 using a nut unit 952 such that the second end is moved via the<br>
mounting plate during rotation.<br>
Thus, the lifting jack 950 controls the upper and lower widths of the guide plate 900<br>
and finely controls the angle of the steel wire 522.<br>
The function of the first and second head blocks 710 and 720 may be designed as<br>
follows. When the first head block 710, which is placed at an upper location, has a<br>
fixing function, the second head block 720, which is placed at a lower location, has a<br>
tensioning function. In that case, the first head block 710 of another fixing apparatus<br>
provided on the opposite end of the wale 520 has a tensioning function, while the<br><br>
second head block 720 has a fixing function.<br>
More preferably, a shear key 615 extends from the lower part of the cross beam 610<br>
such that the shear key 615 interferes with the end of the wale 520 along a horizontal<br>
line. Because the end of the wale 520 that receives the compressive force is located<br>
such that it faces in the direction opposite the direction from which force is transmitted<br>
from the compression beam 620, the compressive force is offset by the force<br>
transmitted from the compression beam 620.<br>
To support the shear key 615, a connection member 1000 is preferably combined<br>
with the wale 520 such that the connection member 1000 is located between the wale<br>
520 and the fixing apparatus. The connection member 1000 is integrated with the shear<br>
key 615 of the fixing apparatus using bolts.<br>
The connection member 1000 is preferably provided with an upper shear key 1010<br>
which protrudes forwards, so that the force transmitted from the upper shear key 1010<br>
counteracts and offsets the compressive force transmitted to the end of the cross beam<br>
610.<br>
Further, first and second wire guide members 715 and 725 having a pipe shape are<br>
preferably provided inside the reinforcing plate 810 at a location between the first and<br>
second head blocks 710 and 720 and the raker beam 630, thus separately guiding the<br>
steel wires 522 to the first and second head blocks 710 and 720.<br>
The fixing apparatus having the above-mentioned construction according to the<br>
second embodiment of the present invention will be operated as follows.<br>
During pit excavation work for constructing an underground structure, the fixing<br>
apparatus according to the present invention has the bracing beam 550 connected<br>
thereto at each corner and fixes and tensions the ends of the steel wires 522 using the<br>
first and second head blocks 710 and 720.<br>
In the above state, the ends of the steel wires 522 enter the connection member and<br>
are guided to the first and second head blocks 710 and 720 by the first and second steel<br>
wire guide members 715 and 725.<br>
Thereafter, the first head block 710 fixes the ends of the steel wires 522, while the<br>
second head block 720 tensions the ends of the steel wires 522. Then, the lifting jack<br>
950 is operated to curve the steel wires 522 as desired, thus controlling the upper and<br>
lower widths of the guide plate 900.<br>
In other words, when the second end of the lifting jack 950, which is bolted to the<br>
mounting plate, is rotated in one direction, the guide plate 900 moves upwards or<br>
downwards according to the direction in which the lifting jack 950 is rotated, so that<br>
the upper and lower widths of the guide plate 900 can be controlled and change the<br>
curve of the steel wires 522 which enter the guide plate 900.<br>
In the fixing apparatus, the bracing beams 550 placed at corners are connected to<br><br>
the compression beam 620 having the triangular support structure. Further, the steel<br>
wires 522 of the wale 520 are tensioned and fixed by the first and second head blocks<br>
710 and 720. Thus, the fixing apparatus executes the function of connecting the<br>
bracing beams 550 and the function of tensioning and fixing the steel wire 522 at one<br>
place.<br>
Thus, each corner of a pit has a simple structure and provides an empty space other<br>
than the area having the fixing apparatus, thus enlarging the work space. Further, the<br>
present invention can variably manage the work of fixing and tensioning the steel<br>
wires 522 of a wale and the work of tensioning and fixing the steel wires 522 placed at<br>
the opposite side of the wale 520.<br>
At each corner of the pit, the bracing beam 550 is fixed and connected to the<br>
compression beam 620, so that the compressive force transmitted from the bracing<br>
beam 550 passes through the compression beam 620 and is transmitted both to the<br>
raker beam 630 and to the cross beam 610. Thereafter, the compressive force is<br>
transmitted to the wale 520 through the connection member 1000, thus the wale 520<br>
can efficiently withstand soil pressure.<br>
In the above state, the shear key 615 of the fixing apparatus and the upper shear key<br>
1010 of the connection member 1000 are connected to the end of the connection<br>
member 1000 and to the end of the cross beam 610, respectively, and thus they<br>
interfere with each other. Thus, the direction of the compressive force transmitted from<br>
the bracing beam 550 is opposite the direction of the soil pressure transmitted from the<br>
wale 520, so that the compressive force offsets the soil pressure.<br>
The fixing apparatus according to the second embodiment of the present invention<br>
is preferably used with the connection member in corners during pit excavation work.<br>
However, it should be understood that the fixing apparatus may be used without the<br>
connection member.<br><br>

The present invention provides an apparatus for fixing a steel wire of a wale. In an<br>
embodiment, the present invention has an improved structure capable of fixing the<br>
steel wire of a prestressed wale at a location spaced apart from one end of the wale<br>
during pit excavation work for constructing an underground structure. The fixing<br>
apparatus prevents a sharp angle from being formed in the steel wire, and instead<br>
allows the steel wire to extend in the form of an arc shape, thus securing sufficient<br>
moment. The fixing apparatus provides strong reinforcement of parts to which high<br>
compressive force and high tensile force are applied. In other embodiment, the<br>
present invention has an improved structure capable of supporting a bracing beam<br>
and fixing and tensioning the steel wire in the bracing beam in corners during pit<br>
excavation work. At the corner, the fixing apparatus forms a triangular structure<br>
which can stably support the bracing beam and can fix and tension the steel wire at<br>
the same time, thus improving work efficiency. Further, the fixing apparatus has a<br>
simple structure, thus reducing the consumption of materials and reducing<br>
construction expenses.</td>
