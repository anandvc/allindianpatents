				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a process for hard anodising aluminium and its alloys, and is particularly related to hard anodising aluminium alloys containing impurities of iron bearing inter-metal1ics.<br>
Hard anodized metals particularly aluminium and its alloys find use in many industrial applications. Spacecraft deployment mechanism components, aircraft under carriage legs, naval magazine ammunition guides, hydraulic gears, etc. are made with hard anodized aluminium and its alloys. They are also excellent bases for dry lubricants and are used to prevent cold welding in space conditions. Components made with hard anodized aluminium and its alloys exhibit reduced friction on sliding surfaces. The anodic film (alumina) has only about one-tenth of the thermal conductivity of aluminium and therefore can withstand temperatures of upto 2050°C. Components of aluminium which require high resistance to heat are therefore applied with hard anodic coating. Further, the infrared emissivity of hard anodic film above 75 um thickness is about 0.90. Hence hard anodizing of surfaces improves its heat radiation characteristics.<br><br>
It is found that iron bearing impurities in aluminium and aluminium based alloys inhibit the growth of anodic film thereon during conventional anodizing processes. Presence of iron bearing impurities causes steep rise in bath voltage without attaining the required film thickness of 50 to 80 um. it is also noticed that the edges of the components burn, if hard anodization is continued to attain the required thickness, thus damaging the article.<br>
An object of this invention is to develop a process for hard anodization where the deleterious effect of iron bearing intermetal1ics is countermanded. Yet another object is for the production of continuous coating or anodization of articles till the desired thickness is achieved. Impurities such as iron bearing intermetallics are removed by dissolution in the electrolyte hath during anodization.<br>
The process consists generally of the following steps sequentially:<br>
1.	Solvent degreasing<br>
2.	Descaling<br><br>
3.	Neutralizing / desmutting<br>
4.	Hard anodizing<br>
5.	Sealing (optional)<br>
The above process steps are described in detail hereinafter:<br>
1.	Solvent degreasing is carried out in a known manner in<br>
stainless steel tanks and the solvent and the article may be<br>
agitated with ultrasonic wave generating transducer. Any<br>
suitable degreasing agent or solvent such as trichloroethylene or<br>
isopropanol may be used. The article may be immersed in this and<br>
agitated either mechanically or ultrasonically for about ten<br>
minutes.  It is then taken out of the bath and dried.<br>
2.	Descaling is also carried out by known methods of<br>
deoxidizing or alkaline cleaning. Deoxidizing bath consists of<br>
an aqueous solution of sulphuric acid and chromium trioxide. The<br>
range preferred is 50 to 200 ml of sulphuric acid and 30 to 100<br>
gms. of chromium trioxide per litre of water. The bath<br>
temperature may be 40 to 80 C. The article is immersed in the<br>
bath for a period of 2 - 5 minutes to effect descaling.<br><br>
Alkaline mediuffl for descaling which may be used consists of an aqueous solution containing 40 - 120 gms. of sodium hydroxide, 10 - 30 gms. of sodium fluoride, 1-3 gms of sodium polysulphate and 1-2 gms. of any known wetting agent per litre of water.<br>
The bath temperature may range from 40 to 80 and the time for descaling is about 2-5 mts. The article may then be removed from the bath and rinsed with water.<br>
3.	Neutralizing / Desmutting. The descaled article is then<br>
neutralized by immersing it in nitric acid bath which contains<br>
250 - 750 ml of 70% nitric acid per litre of water. Neutralizing<br>
or desmutting takes place at 10 - SS"^C and the time taken is<br>
approximately 1-3 minutes. The article is then taken out and<br>
rinsed with water thoroughly.<br>
4.	Hard Anodizing of the article thus processed is carried out<br>
in a bath consisting of an aqueous solution of sulphuric acid,<br>
hydrochloric  acid, aluminium sulphate and glycol  or  glycerol.<br><br>
The  above • compounds may be present	in the bath  in  the  range<br>
specified below;<br>
Sulphuric acid (SG 1.84)      ;	80 - 125 ml/L<br>
Hydrochloric acid (35-38%)    ;	1-6 mi/L<br>
Aluminium sulphate           :	0-20 g/L<br>
Methylene or Ethylene<br>
glycol or glycerol	:    0-30 ml/L<br>
The presence of aluminium sulphate and glycol or glycerol is optional. Aluminium sulphate may be added for artificial ageing of electrolyte and glycol or glycerol for improving the glossiness of hard-anodic coating.  The bath temperature may vary<br>
from -10 to +5°C.  Anodization is carried out under refrigeration<br>
2 conditions and the current density may vary from 15 - 40 A/Ft  at<br>
a voltage of upto 100 volts.  The article is agitated in the bath<br>
preferably with compressed air to maintain  uniform electrolyte<br>
temperature.   A  coating thickness of 40 to 100 um  is  achieved<br>
during 60 to 180 minutes.  The article is thereafter rinsed with<br>
water.<br>
Sealing of the anodic pores is carried out optionally. It is found that after the sealing step, the corrosion resistance of<br><br>
the film is increased marginally while microhardness is reduced. Hence this sealing step may be carried out only if corrosion resistance is preferred over microhardness of the film. Sealing bath consists of aolution of 0 - 1 gm/litre of ammonium acetate in the pH range of 6,5 to 7.0. The article is placed in a tank containing boiling sealing solution for a period of 1 to 2 hours which is subsequently removed, rinsed with water, and dried.<br>
It is observed that an anodic film of upto 120 um can be obtained by this process even in the case of aluminiuai alloy components containing iron based intermetalHc impurities which are difficult to hard anodize by conventional methods. The cathod used in this anodizing step may be lead or carbon. Microhardness value of this coating is above 300 VHN and its infrared emmittance is in the order of 0.90. The coatings were found to withstand normal tests for ground and space applicat ions.<br>
The  process  for hard anodizing aluminium  and  its  alloys containing impurities of iron bearing intermetal1ics according to<br><br>
this  invention comprises the steps of degreasing, descaling  and desmutting the same in a known manner followed by anodization in  an electrolytic bath containing an aqueous solution of  80 125 ml/L of sulphuric acid and 1-6 ml/L of hydrochloric acid at a bath temperature of -10 to 5°C.<br>
The article may be washed and dried after the completion of each individual step.<br>
It wi11 occur that various modificat ions to the above disclosed embodiments may be made by persons of ordinary skill in this art and that such obvioiis modifications and alterations are intended to be included in the appended claims.<br><br><br>
