ROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/973,280, filed on September 18, 2007. The disclosure of the!<br>
above application is incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT RIGHTS<br>
[0001] This disclosure was produced pursuant to U.S. Government<br>
Contract No. DE-FC-04-03 AL67635 with the Department of Energy (DoE). The<br>
U.S. Government has certain rights in this disclosure.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to particulate matter (PM) filters,<br>
and more particularly to electrically heated PM filters.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004] Engines such as diesel engines produce particulate matter (PM)<br>
that is filtered from exhaust gas by a PM filter. The PM filter is disposed in an<br>
exhaust system of the engine. The PM filter reduces emission of PM that is<br>
generated during combustion.	<br><br>
[0005] Over time, the PM filter becomes full. During regeneration, the<br>
PM may be burned within the PM filter. Regeneration may involve heating the<br>
PM filter to a combustion temperature of the PM. There are various ways to<br>
perform regeneration including modifying engine management, using a fuel<br>
burner, using a catalytic oxidizer to increase the exhaust temperature with after<br>
injection of fuel, using resistive heating coils, and/or using microwave energy]<br>
The resistive heating coils are typically arranged in contact with the PM filter to<br>
allow heating by both conduction and convection.<br>
[0006] Diesel PM combusts when temperatures above a combustion<br>
temperature such as 600 Â°C are attained. The start of combustion causes a<br>
further increase in temperature. While spark-ignited engines typically have low<br>
oxygen levels in the exhaust gas stream, diesel engines have significantly higher<br>
oxygen levels. While the increased oxygen levels make fast regeneration of the!<br>
PM filter possible, it may also pose some problems.<br>
[0007] PM reduction systems that use fuel tend to decrease fuel<br>
economy. For example, many fuel-based PM reduction systems decrease fuel<br>
economy by 5%. Electrically heated PM reduction systems reduce fuel economy<br>
by a negligible amount. However, durability of the electrically heated PM<br>
reduction systems has been difficult to achieve.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0008] A system is provided and includes a particulate matter (PM)<br>
filter with an upstream end for receiving exhaust gas, a downstream end and<br><br><br>
zones. The system also includes a heating element. A control module<br>
selectively activates the heating element to inductively heat one of the zones.<br>
[0009] A method is provided that includes receiving an exhaust gas via<br>
a particulate matter (PM) filter that has an upstream end, a downstream end and<br>
zones. A heating element is selectively activated to inductively heat one of the<br>
zones.<br>
[0010] A system is provided and includes heating elements that are in<br>
communication with a particulate matter filter that receives an exhaust gas. A<br>
control module selectively activates one of the heating elements to inductively<br>
heat a zone of the particulate matter filter.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0019] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should be<br>
understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals<br>
indicate like or corresponding parts and features.<br>
[0020] As used herein, the term module may refer to, be part of, or,<br>
include an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a<br>
processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and/or memory (shared, dedicated, or<br><br><br>
group) that execute one or more software or firmware programs, a combinationa<br>
logic circuit, and/or other suitable components that provide the described<br>
functionality.<br>
[0021] Referring now to FIG. 1, an exemplary diesel engine system 1C<br>
that includes a regeneration system 11 is shown. It is appreciated that the diese<br>
engine system 10 is merely exemplary in nature and that the regeneration;<br>
system 11 described herein can be implemented in various engine systems<br>
implementing a zone heated particulate filter. Such engine systems may include,<br><br>
but are not limited to, gasoline direct injection engine systems and homogeneous<br>
charge compression ignition engine systems. For ease of the discussion, the<br>
disclosure will be discussed in the context of a diesel engine system.<br>
[0022] A turbocharged diesel engine system 10 includes an engine 12<br>
that combusts an air and fuel mixture to produce drive torque. Air enters the<br>
system by passing through an air filter 14. Air passes through the air filter 14 and<br><br>
is drawn into a turbocharger 18. The turbocharger 18 compresses the fresh air<br>
entering the system 10. The greater the compression of the air generally, the<br>
greater the output of the engine 12. Compressed air then passes through an air<br>
cooler 20 before entering into an intake manifold 22.<br><br>
[0023] Air within the intake manifold 22 is distributed into cylinders 26.<br>
Although four cylinders 26 are illustrated, the systems and methods of the<br>
present disclosure can be implemented in engines having any number of<br>
cylinders. It is also appreciated that the systems and methods of the present<br>
disclosure can be implemented in a V-type cylinder configuration. Fuel is<br><br>
injected into the cylinders 26 by fuel injectors 28. Heat from the compressed air<br>
ignites the air/fuel mixture. Combustion of the air/fuel mixture creates exhaust<br>
Exhaust exits the cylinders 26 into the exhaust system.	<br><br>
[0024] The exhaust system includes an exhaust manifold 30, a diese<br><br>
oxidation catalyst (DOC) 32, and a particulate matter (PM) filter assembly 34 with<br>
heating elements 35 for zoned heating of the PM filter. Optionally, an EGR valve<br>
(not shown) re-circulates a portion of the exhaust back into the intake manifold<br>
22. The remainder of the exhaust is directed into the turbocharger 18 to drive a<br>
turbine. The turbine facilitates the compression of the fresh air received from the<br>
air filter 14. Exhaust flows from the turbocharger 18 through the DOC 32 and<br>
into the PM filter assembly 34. The DOC 32 oxidizes the exhaust based on the<br>
post combustion air/fuel ratio. The amount of oxidation increases the<br>
temperature of the exhaust. The PM filter assembly 34 receives exhaust from<br>
the DOC 32 and filters any soot particulates present in the exhaust. The heating<br>
elements 35 heat the soot to a regeneration temperature as will be described;<br>
below.<br>
[0025] A control module 44 controls the engine and PM filter<br>
regeneration based on various sensed information and soot loading. More<br>
specifically, the control module 44 estimates loading of the PM filter assembly 34.<br>
When the estimated loading is at a predetermined level and/or the exhaust flow<br>
rate is within a desired range, current is controlled to the PM filter assembly 34<br>
via a power source 46 to initiate the regeneration process. The duration of the<br><br><br>
regeneration process may be varied based upon the estimated amount of<br>
particulate matter within the PM filter assembly 34, the number of zones, etc.<br>
[0026] Current is applied to one or more of the heating elements 35<br>
during the regeneration process to inductively heat soot within the PM filter. The<br>
current has a frequency that is effective for heating small particles, such as soot<br>
or PM. The frequency may be approximately between 50-450KHz. More<br>
specifically, inductive energy heats soot in selected zones of the PM filter<br>
assembly 34 for predetermined periods, respectively. Soot in the activated<br>
zones is heated to a point of ignition. The ignition of the soot heats the exhaust<br>
gas and creates an exotherm. The exotherm propagates along the PM filter and,<br>
heats soot downstream from the heated zone.<br>
[0027] In one embodiment, the regeneration process is divided up into<br>
regeneration periods. Each period is associated with the regeneration within an<br>
axial or radial portion of the PM filter. As an example, the heating elements may<br>
be activated sequentially axially from the output (downstream end) of the PM!<br>
filter to the input (upstream end). The duration or length of each period may<br>
vary. The activation of a heating element heats soot in an area of a zone. The<br>
remainder of the regeneration process associated with that regeneration period is<br>
achieved using the heat generated by the heated soot and by the heated exhaust<br>
passing through that area and thus involves convective heating. Non-<br>
regeneration periods or periods in which all of the heating elements are<br>
deactivated may exist between regeneration periods to allow cooling of the PM<br>
filter and thus reduction of internal pressures within the PM filter.<br><br><br>
[0028] The above system may include sensors 40 for determining<br>
exhaust flow levels, exhaust temperature levels, exhaust pressure levels, oxygen<br>
levels, intake air flow rates, intake air pressure, intake air temperature, engine<br>
speed, EGR, etc. An exhaust flow sensor 42, an exhaust temperature sensor 43,<br>
exhaust pressure sensors 45, oxygen sensor 48, an EGR sensor 50, an intake;<br>
air flow sensor 52, an intake air pressure sensor 54, an intake air temperature;<br>
sensor 56, and an engine speed sensor 58 are shown.<br>
[0029] Referring now to FIG. 2, a perspective view of an exemplary]<br>
zoned PM filter assembly 100 with respective inductive heating elements 102 is<br>
shown. The PM filter assembly 100 includes a PM filter 104 and the heating<br>
elements 102 attached thereon. In the embodiment shown, the heating elements<br>
102 are in a parallel arrangement and positioned in series and axially along the<br>
PM filter 104 from an input 108 to an output 110 of the PM filter 104. The heating<br>
elements 102 may be electrically conductive and have any number of coils, such<br>
as the coils 112. The spacing of the coils and the spacing of the heating<br>
elements 102 may vary depending upon the application and the heating flexibility<br>
and control desired. Although three discrete heating elements 102 are shown,<br>
the number of heating elements may vary per application and the heating<br>
flexibility and control desired.<br>
[0030] The heating elements 102 provide an electrical heater that is<br>
divided in zones, such as zones Z1-Z3, to reduce electrical power required to<br>
heat the PM filter 104 and to provide selective heating of particular portions of the<br>
PM filter 104. By heating only the selected portions of the PM filter 104, the<br><br>
magnitude of forces in a substrate of the PM filter 104 is reduced due to therma<br>
expansion. As a result, higher localized soot temperatures may be used during<br>
regeneration without damaging the PM filter 104.<br>
[0031] The PM filter 104 may be catalyzed. The heated soot and<br>
exhaust gas causes PM in the PM filter 104 to bum, which regenerates the PM<br>
filter 104. The heating elements 35 generate a magnetic field, which creates<br>
iddy currents within the soot. Resistance of the soot to the Eddy currents<br>
causes heating of the soot. The soot temperature increases until a critical<br>
temperature at which the scot ignites. The ignition of the soot creates an<br>
exotherm that propagates in the flow direction of the exhaust axially along the<br>
PM filter 104. When the soot in the PM filter 104 reaches a sufficiently high<br>
temperature, the associated heating elements) may be turned off. Combustion<br>
of soot then cascades down the PM filter 104 without requiring power to be<br>
maintained to the electrical heater.<br>
[0032] Referring now to FIGs. 3A-3C, perspective views of the zoned<br>
PM filter 104 illustrating some example regeneration process steps are shown.<br>
Zones of the PM filter 104 may be regenerated sequentially starting with the zone<br>
closest to the output 110 of the PM filter (zone 1). This limits the amount of PM<br>
filter regeneration during each regeneration period. In FIG. 3A, the heating<br>
element closest to the output 110 and associated with zone 1 is activated.)<br>
Volume of the PM filter 104 surrounded by the heating element, such as heating<br>
element 120, is the primary region where heating and light off of the soot occurs.<br>
The volume is represented by shaded area 121. The exotherm of this event<br><br>
coupled with the exhaust flow continues the regeneration towards the outlet 110<br>
and bottom face 122 of the PM filter 104, which increases the effective volume of<br>
the regeneration zone, as shown in FIG. 3B. This is shown by shaded area 124<br>
[0033] FIG. 3C illustrates inductive heating of zone 2, which is<br>
performed subsequent to inductive heating of zone 1. The inductive heating of<br>
zone 2 includes similar regeneration characteristics as that of zone 1 until the<br>
associated exotherm reaches the previously cleaned region of zone 1. The<br>
heating of zone 2 is shown by shaded area 126. This process may continue fort<br>
zone 3.<br>
[0034] The PM filter 104 may have a predetermined peak operating<br>
temperature. The peak operating temperature may be associated with a point of<br>
potential PM filter degradation. For example, a PM filter may begin to breakdown<br>
at operating temperatures greater than 800Â°C. The peak operating temperature<br>
may vary for different PM filters. The peak operating temperature may be<br>
associated with an average temperature of a portion of the PM filter or an<br>
average temperature of the PM filter as a whole.<br>
[0035] To prevent damaging the PM filter 104, and thus to increase the<br>
operating life of the PM filter 104, the embodiments of the present disclosure may<br>
adjust PM filter regeneration based on soot loading. A target maximum operating<br>
temperature TM is set for a PM filter. The target maximum operating temperature<br>
TÎ may correspond with a breakdown temperature of the PM filter. In one<br>
embodiment, the target maximum operating temperature TÎ is equal to the<br><br><br>
breakdown temperature multiple by a safety factor, such as 95%Â±2%. Thii<br>
safety factor is provided as an example only; other safety factors may be used.<br>
[0036] Regeneration is performed when soot loading is less than or<br>
equal to a soot loading level associated with the maximum operating temperature<br>
TÎ- The regeneration may be performed when soot loading levels are low on<br>
within a predetermined range. The predetermined range has a lower soot<br>
loading threshold Sn and an upper soot loading threshold Su, that is associated<br>
with the maximum operating temperature TM. Limiting peak operating<br>
temperatures of a PM filter, minimizes pressures in and expansion of the PM<br>
filter. In one embodiment, soot loading is estimated and regeneration is<br>
performed based thereon. In another embodiment, when soot loading is greater]<br>
ithan desired for regeneration, mitigation strategies are performed to reduce PM<br>
filter peak temperatures during regeneration.	<br>
[0037] Soot loading may be estimated from parameters, such as<br>
mileage, exhaust pressure, exhaust drop off pressure across a PM filter, by a<br>
predictive method, etc. Mileage refers to vehicle mileage, which approximately<br>
corresponds to or can be used to estimate vehicle engine operating time and/or<br>
the amount of exhaust gas generated. As an example, regeneration may be<br>
performed when a vehicle has traveled approximately 200-300 miles. The<br>
amount of soot generated depends upon vehicle operation over time. At idle<br>
speeds less soot is generated than when operating at travel speeds. The<br>
amount of exhaust gas generated is related to the state of soot loading in the PM<br>
filter.<br><br>
[0038] Exhaust pressure can be used to estimate the amount of<br>
exhaust generated over a period of time. When an exhaust pressure exceeds a<br>
predetermined level or when an exhaust pressure decreases below a<br>
predetermined level, regeneration may be performed. For example when<br>
exhaust pressure entering a PM filter exceeds a predetermined level<br>
regeneration may be performed. As another example when exhaust pressure<br>
exiting a PM filter is below a predetermined level, regeneration may be<br>
performed.<br>
[0039] Exhaust drop off pressure may be used to estimate the amount<br>
of soot in a PM filter. For example, as the drop off pressure increases the<br>
amount of soot loading increases. The exhaust drop off pressure may be<br>
determined by determining pressure of exhaust entering a PM filter minus<br>
pressure of exhaust exiting the PM filter. Exhaust system pressure sensors may<br>
be used to provide these pressures.<br>
[0040] A predictive method may include the determination of one or<br>
more engine operating conditions, such as engine load, fueling schemes, fuel<br>
injection timing, and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). A cumulative weighting<br>
factor may be used based on the engine conditions. The cumulative weighting<br>
factor is related to soot loading. When the cumulative weighting factor exceeds a<br>
threshold, regeneration may be performed.	<br><br>
[0041] Based on the estimated soot loading and a known peak<br>
operating temperature for the PM filter 104, regeneration is performed to prevent<br><br>
the PM filter 104 from operating at temperatures above the peak operating<br>
emperature.<br>
[0042] Designing a control system to target a selected soot loading<br>
allows PM filter regenerations without intrusive controls. A robust regeneration<br>
strategy as provided herein, removes soot from a PM filter, while limiting peak<br>
operating temperatures. Limiting of peak operating temperatures reduces;<br>
thermal stresses on a substrate of a PM filter and thus prevents damage to the<br>
PM filter, which can be caused by high soot exotherms. Durability of the PM filter<br>
is increased.<br>
[0043] When soot loading is greater than a threshold level associated<br>
with a set peak regeneration temperature, mitigation strategies may be<br>
performed to reduce PM filter peak temperatures during regeneration. For<br>
example, when a maximum soot loading threshold is set at approximately 2g/l<br>
and current soot loading is 4g/l, to minimize temperatures within a PM filter<br>
during regeneration engine operation is adjusted. The adjustment may include<br>
oxygen control and exhaust flow control.<br>
[0044] Soot loading may be greater than an upper threshold level, for<br>
example, when an engine is operated to receive a high intake air flow rate for an<br>
extended period of time. Such operation may occur on a long freeway entrance<br><br>
ramp or during acceleration on a freeway. As another example, a soot loading<br>
upper threshold may be exceeded when throttle of an engine is continuously<br><br>
actuated between full ON and full OFF for an extended period of time. High air<br>
flow rates can prevent or limit regeneration of a PM filter.<br><br><br><br>
[0045] During oxygen control, the amount of oxygen entering the PM<br>
filter is decreased to decrease the exotherm temperatures of the PM filter during<br>
regeneration. To decrease oxygen levels airflow may be decreased, EGR may<br><br>
be increased, and/or fuel injection may be increased. The fuel injection may be<br>
increased within engine cylinders and/or into the associated exhaust system<br>
The burning of more fuel decreases the amount of oxygen present in the exhaust<br>
system.<br>
[0046] A large increase in exhaust flow can aid in distinguishing or<br>
minimizing an exothermic reaction in a PM filter. Exhaust flow control may<br>
include an increase in exhaust flow by a downshift in a transmission or by an<br>
increase in idle speed. The increase in engine speed increases the amount of<br>
exhaust flow.<br>
[0047] Although the following steps are primarily described with respect<br>
to the embodiments of FIGs. 1-3, the steps may be easily modified to apply to<br>
other embodiments of the present invention<br>
[0048] Referring now to FIG. 4, steps for regenerating a PM filter arej<br>
shown. In step 300, control of a control module, such as the control module 44,<br>
begins and proceeds to step 301. In step 301, sensor signals are generated.<br>
The sensor signals may include an exhaust flow signal, an exhaust temperature<br>
signal, exhaust pressure signal, oxygen signal, intake air flow signal, intake air<br>
pressure signal, intake air temperature signal, engine speed signal, an EGR<br>
signal, etc., which may be generated by the above-described sensors.<br><br>
[0049] In step 302, control estimates current soot loading S1 of the PM<br>
filter. Control may estimate soot loading as described above. The estimation<br>
may be based on vehicle mileage, exhaust pressure, exhaust drop off pressure<br>
across the PM filter, and/or a predictive method. The predictive method may<br>
include estimation based on one or more engine operating parameters, such as<br>
engine load, fueling schemes, fuel injection timing, and EGR. In step 303,<br>
control determines whether the current soot loading Si is greater than a soot<br>
loading lower threshold St. When the current soot loading S1 is greater than the<br>
lower threshold Stt control proceeds to step 304, otherwise control returns to step<br>
302<br>
[0050] In step 304, control determines whether current soot loading Si<br>
is less than a soot loading upper threshold Sut. The upper threshold Sut may<br>
correspond with a set PM maximum operating temperature, such as the<br>
maximum operating temperature TÎ- When the current soot loading S1 is less<br>
ithan the upper threshold Sut then control proceeds to step 308. When the current<br>
soot loading Si is greater than or equal to the upper threshold Sut then control<br>
proceeds to step 310.<br>
[0051] in steps 309 and 310, control determines whether to prevent or<br>
limit regeneration. Control may prevent regeneration, prevent regeneration for a<br>
predetermined time period, and/or perform mitigation strategies as described;<br>
above to limit peak temperatures in the PM filter during regeneration. When<br>
regeneration is prevented, control may end at Step 328. When regeneration is<br>
prevented for a predetermined time period, control may return to step 302, 303,<br><br><br>
or proceed to step 311. Control may prevent regeneration when mitigation<br>
strategies can not be performed or when mitigation strategies are incapable of<br>
preventing and/or.limiting the peak temperature of the PM filter from exceeding a<br>
predetermined threshold. The threshold may be the upper threshold Sut.<br>
[0052] In step 311, control performs mitigation strategies. Step 311;<br>
may be performed while performing regeneration steps 312-324. Control<br>
proceeds to step 308 before, during or after performing step 311.<br>
[0053] If control determines that regeneration is needed in step 304,<br>
control selects one or more zones in step 308 and activates one or more heating<br>
elements for inductive heating of the selected zone(s) in step 312. Inductive<br>
heating refers to heating an electrically conductive or magnetic object by<br>
electromagnetic induction, where eddy currents are generated within the material<br>
and resistance leads to Joule heating of the material. There is a relationship<br>
between the frequency of the alternating current and the depth to which it<br>
penetrates in the material. Low frequencies of approximately 5-30KHz are<br>
effective for thicker materials, since they provide deep heat penetration. Higher<br>
frequencies of approximately 100-400 KHz are effective for small particles or<br>
shallow penetration, such as diesel particulates.<br>
[0054] The PM filter is regenerated by selectively heating one or morel<br>
of the zones in the PM filter and igniting the soot using inductive heating. When<br>
soot within the selected zones reaches a regeneration temperature, the<br>
associated heating elements are turned off and the burning soot then cascades<br>
down the PM filter, which is similar to a burning fuse on a firework. In other<br><br>
words, the heating elements may be activated only long enough to start the soot<br>
ignition and is then shut off. Other regeneration systems typically use both<br>
conduction and/or convection and maintain power to the heater (at lower<br>
temperatures such as 600 degrees Celsius) throughout the soot burning process<br>
As a result, these systems tend to use more power than the system proposed in<br>
the present disclosure.<br>
[0055] In one embodiment, the zone closest to the outlet of the PM<br>
filter is regenerated first followed by the next nearest zone. The zones may be,<br>
regenerated in a sequential, one at a time, independent fashion. In another<br>
embodiment, multiple zones are selected and heated during the same time<br>
period.<br>
[0056] In step 315, control determines current, voltage and/or<br>
frequency to be applied to the selected heating elements. The current, voltage<br>
and/or frequency may be predetermined and stored in a memory, determined via<br>
a look-up table, or determined based on engine operating parameters, some of<br>
which are stated herein.<br>
[0057] In step 316, control estimates a heating period sufficient to<br>
achieve a minimum soot temperature based on at least one of current, voltage,<br>
exhaust flow and exhaust temperature. The minimum soot temperature should<br>
be sufficient to start the soot burning and to create a cascade effect. For<br>
example only, the minimum soot temperature may be set to 700 degrees Celsuis<br>
or greater. In an alternate step 320 to step 316, control estimates current and<br><br><br>
voltage needed to achieve minimum soot temperatures based on a<br>
predetermined heating period, exhaust flow and exhaust temperature.<br>
[0058] In step 324, control determines whether the heating period is<br>
up. If step 324 is true, control determines whether additional zones need to be<br>
regenerated in step 326. If step 326 is true, control returns to step 308.<br>
[0059] The burning soot is the fuel that continues the regeneration<br>
This process is continued for each heating zone until the PM filter is completely<br>
regenerated. Control ends in step 328.<br>
[0060] The above-described steps are meant to be illustrative<br>
examples; the steps may be performed sequentially, synchronously,<br>
simultaneously, continuously, during overlapping time periods or in a different<br>
order depending upon the application.<br>
[0061] The above described method provides inductive heating of<br>
zones of a PM filter while reducing spontaneous power consumption in the PM<br>
filter and thus improves robustness and life of the PM filter.<br>
[0062] In use, the control module determines when the PM filter<br>
requires regeneration. The determination is based on soot levels within the PM<br>
filter. Alternately, regeneration can be performed periodically or on an event<br>
basis. The control module may estimate when the entire PM filter needs;<br>
regeneration or when zones within the PM filter need regeneration. When the<br>
control module determines that the entire PM filter needs regeneration, the<br>
control module sequentially activates one or more of the zones at a time to<br>
initiate regeneration within the associated downstream portion of the PM filter,<br><br><br><br>
After the zone or zones are regenerated, one or more other zones are activated<br>
while the others are deactivated. This approach continues until alt of the zones<br>
have been activated. When the control module determines that one of the zones<br>
needs regeneration, the control module activates the zone corresponding to the<br>
associated downstream portion of the PM filter needing regeneration.<br>
[0063] The present disclosure provides a low power regeneration<br>
technique with short regeneration periods and thus overall regeneration time of a<br>
PM filter. The present disclosure may substantially reduce the fuel economy<br>
penalty, decrease tailpipe temperatures, and improve system robustness due to<br>
the smaller regeneration time. The embodiments provide PM heating without the<br>
use of a susceptor or introduction of a material to absorb conductive heating<br>
Resistance of the soot within a PM filter provides the internal heating to start a<br>
regeneration process.<br>
[0064] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the disclosure can be implemented in a<br>
variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure includes particular examples,<br>
the true scope of the disclosure should not be so limited since other modifications<br>
will become apparent to the skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, the<br>
specification, and the following claims.<br><br>
