DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The "AGO system uses the great bandwidth of a TEQI mode microwave waveguide for high bit rate transmission<br><br>
The present invention relates to information transmission device for systems using radiating waveguides along which a mobile travels, the device comprises  <br>
means for localized sampling along said radiating waveguide of some of the energy of said unmodulated carrier wave, means for rachating said <br>
method earrier wome to and mobile  whier and said modulator means (7,8)comprising means <br>
 has a modulator in edges said help whome hads whome (5) at of high impedence at the<br>
 slot in said characterized in that <br>
modulator means for applying to said unmoaulated carfier~wave—a^ local modulation signal representing the information addressed to said mobile and means for radiating said modulated carrier wave to _said mobile,<br><br>
of information between mobiles and the ground.<br>
The great bandwidth also enables an unmodulated additional carrier wave to be transmitted in the radiating waveguide.<br>
This unmodulated carrier wave is emitted at a low level and propagates all along the radiating waveguide.<br>
The unmodulated carrier wave is rot strongly attenuated and it is amplified by the same in-line repeaters as are used to regenerate the other signals transmitted in the radiating waveguide.<br>
The unmodulated carrier wave is therefore present over all the length of the radiating waveguide, and essentially inside the waveguide.<br>
The unmodulated carrier wave is not discernible from the mobile and initially does not carry any identifiable signature or information.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the information transmission device and method for systems using radiating waveguides, for example the IAGO system, sample some of the energy propagating in the waveguide in a manner that is not discernible in the ovarall energy balance at locations along the radiating waveguide that are strategic in terms of operation of mobiles.<br>
The energy sampled is radiated to the mobile.<br>
At this time, a local modulation signal that is required to be delivered to the mobile traveling along the wavegur.de is applied to the unmodulated carrier wave.<br>
Figure 1 is a general view of a. preferred embodiment of the information transmission device of the invention for systems using radiating waveguiies.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the information transmission device of the invention for systems using radiating waveguides, the mobile (not shown) is a rail vehicle.<br>
It is clear that in other applications the mobiles<br>
can be waggons or any other mobile means.<br>
As shown in figure 1, there is a resorant cavity 1 on one side of the radiating waveguide 2.<br>
The radiating waveguide 2 and the resonant cavity 1 each comprise a respective directional coupler 3 and 4, on their sides facing towards each other.<br>
The directional couplers are, for example, two circular apertures the dimensions of which are large in comparison to the period of the unmodulated carrier wave.<br>
Figure 2 shows the radiating waveguide of the<br>
transmission device from figure 1  and  its directional<br>
coupler.<br>
Figure 3A shows the resonant cavity of the transmission device from figure 1 and its directional coupler.<br>
In the IAGO system, the radiatirg waveguide operates in TEo1 mode. There is therefore virtually no electric field to the lateral sides of the radiating waveguide.<br>
The apertures must therefore be large to achieve the required level of coupling; accordingly, this dimension is not very critical from the mechanical point of view.<br>
A construction of this kind provides repetitive coupling coefficients in the order of -40 dE relative to the power level transmitted in the radiating waveguide.<br>
The length of the resonant cavity 1 is made as small as possible so that the interior volume of the resonant cavity resonates in a TEo11 fundamental mode. In this type of embodiment of the resonant cavity, all directional characteristics are eliminated and the coupling coefficient remains exactly the same whether the radiating waveguide is fed from the upstream or downstream end.<br>
The TE011  fundamental mode resonant  cavity is<br>
short-circuited at its ends and incorporates a half-wave resonant slot 5.<br>
The half-wave resonant slot is formed on the large exterior face of the resonant cavity facing towards the rail vehicle.<br>
The half-wave resonant slot is perpendicular to the slots 6 of the radiating waveguide.<br>
The half-wave resonant slot radiates the energy coupled from the radiating waveguide towards the TEo11 mode resonant cavity.<br>
The half-wave resonant slot radiates with linear polarization perpendicular to the regular slots of the radiating waveguide.<br>
These regular slots are the transmission and speed measurement slots of the waveguide.<br>
This radiation provides approximately 15 dB of decoupling relative to the signals transmitted by the transmission and speed measurement slots of the waveguide.<br>
The carrier wave propagating in the waveguide, which is a pure sinusoidal signal, is locally coupled to the rail vehicle by means of the resonant cavity and its half-wave resonant slot.<br>
This sinusoidal signal is modulated locally.<br>
To achieve this a modulator device such as a Schottky type diode, for example, is disposed between the edges of the half-wave resonant slot at a point which has a high impedance at the required frequency.<br>
Figure 3B shows the resonant cavity and its modulator device.<br>
This diode is biased by a direct current applied to its terminals and when so biased short-circuits the half-wave resonant slot, the slot having a high impedance at this point at the working frequency in question.<br>
This  causes  amplitude  modulation  of  the  pure<br>
sinusoidal signal sampled along the radiating waveguide.<br>
The coupling coefficient between the radiating waveguide and the resonant cavity being in the order of -40 dB, the mismatch associated with this short-circuit at the timing rate of the modulation is not detectable in<br>
the radiating waves minde<br>
Likewise, considering a microwave power frequency<br>
level in the radiating waveguide, the modulated signal is re-injected into the radiating waveguide at best only at a level of -80 dB relative to the reference level, that is to say -40 dB in the radiating waveguide to resonant cavity direction and -40 dB in the resonant cavity to radiating waveguide direction.<br>
The modulated signal produced in the resonant cavity is therefore not transmitted along the radiating waveguide and does not have any effect upstream or downstream of the resonant cavity.<br>
The device 8 generates the signal representing the information to be transmitted to the rail vehicle.<br>
This signal representing the information to be transmitted is a bit stream, for example.<br>
The possible bit rate is high and is limited only by the switching time of the Schottky diode and the frequency of the pure sinusoidal signal.<br>
To give an idea of the order of magnitude, several megabits per second may be available.<br>
The device 8 generating the signal representing the information to be transmitted may comprise a picocontroller type device storing a frame in an EEPROM type memory and generating the frame repetitively for application to the Schottky diode as soon as it is supplied with energy.<br>
Other suitable devices able to bias the Schottky diode at the rate of application of the information to be transmitted may be used.<br><br>
As the energy present in the resonent cavity is very low, in the order of 40 dB below the power level present in the radiating waveguide, it is possible to dispose the device 8 generating the signal representing the information to be transmitted judiciously within the resonant cavity without significantly disturbing either the operation of this electronic circuit or the fundamental mode resonance of the resonant cavity.<br>
Figure 3C shows the resonant cavity and its device for generating the signal representing the Information to be transmitted.<br>
The device 8 generating the signal representing the information to be transmitted may advantageously be supplied with power, for example with a current of a few milliamperes at a voltage of 5V, by a remote power feeding arrangement using a low-frequency signal, i.e. a signal at a few hundred kilohertz or even a few megahertz.<br>
Figure 4 is a general view of the information transmission device and its remote power feed device.<br>
The low-frequency signal is coupled magnetically to the resonant cavity by means of two resonant loops 9, 10A or 10B.<br>
For example, a serial type first resonant loop 9 is associated with the emission of energy and a parallel type second resonant loop 10A, 10B is associated with the reception of energy, the energy being emitted and received at the remote power feed frequency.<br>
The energy emitting loop 9 is attached to the rail vehicle (not shown) and generates contiguously a low level of energy, for example less than 1 watt, to be picked up by at least one energy receiver loop 10A, 10B<br>
attached to the resonant cavity 1.<br>
the energy receiver roop 10A, 10B,PROVIDE A REMOVED<br>
power feed  to  the device 8 generating the signal<br><br>
representing the information to be transmitted when the rail vehicle passes.<br>
Despite the fact that the microwave radiation from the energy emitting loop 9 is not closely controlled and may propagate relatively far from the resonant cavity by reflection or diffraction, the signal representing the information to be transmitted to the rail vehicle is generated only when the device 8 generating the signal representing the information to be transmitted is supplied with power via the remote power feed.<br>
Protection against crosstalk is obtained by the fact that the microwave radiation from the energy emitting loop 9 is a low-freguency signal the amplitude of which decreases in accordance with the laws of magnetostatics, that is to say in inverse proportion to the cube of the distance between the emitter and the receiver.<br>
In one embodiment a first energy receiver loop 10A is disposed on the upstream side of the resonant cavity 1 and provides a DC supply voltage V1 as the rail vehicle approaches or moves away and a second energy receiver loop 10B is disposed on the downstream side of the resonant cavity 1 and provides a DC supply voltage V2 as the rail vehicle moves away or approaches.<br>
The device 8 generating the signal representing the information to be transmitted can therefore be continuously energized by the remote power feed as the rail vehicle passes from the upstream side to the downstream side of the resonant cavity or vice versa.<br>
The transition from the DC voltage V1 to the DC voltage V2 or vice versa can be used to provide a signal indicating passage of the rail vehicle over the resonant cavity.<br>
The transition from the DC voltage V1 to the DC voltage V2 can also be used to provide a signal<br><br>
indicating that the rail vehicle passed in the upstream to downstream direction.<br>
The transition from the DC voltage V2 to the DC voltage V1 can also be used to provide a signal indicating that the rail vehicle passed in the downstream to upstrean direction.<br>
Figure 5 shows one embodiment of the modulated carrier wave receiver device disposed on the :.mobile.<br>
This receiver device 11 comprises an antenna 12 connected to a system . 13 providing amplification, filtering at the frequency of the pure sinusoidal signal and amplitude detection/ and its function is to reconstitute the information transmitted.<br><br>
