				<td>A METHOD OF PREPARING A NON-CRYSTALLISABLE POLYOL SYRUP<br>
The invention relates to a new method of preparing a<br>
non-crystallisable polyol syrup that is resistant to heat<br>
and to alkalis.<br>
To be more specific, it relates to a new method of<br>
preparing a polyol syrup that can be used in the<br>
production of soap or detergent, in the formulation of<br>
pharmaceutical syrups or toothpaste, i.e. in any<br>
application that requires, in an alkaline and/or hot<br>
environment, resistance to the formation of colorations<br>
that are undesirable or compounds that are unsuitable<br>
from the taste point of view.<br>
By polyols are meant the products obtained by<br>
catalytic hydrogenation of simple reducing sugars,<br>
complex reducing sugars such as disaccharides, oligo-<br>
saccharides and polysaccharides, and mixtures thereof,<br>
which will be referred to hereinafter as "sugar syrup".<br>
As a general rule, the simple reducing sugars<br>
intended for catalytic hydrogenation in accordance with<br>
the invention are glucose, xylose, fructose and mannose.<br>
The polyols obtained are then sorbitol, xylitol and<br>
mannitol.<br>
The disaccharides are most often maltose,<br>
isomaltulose, maltulose, isomaltose and lactose, which on<br>
catalytic hydrogenation yield maltitol, isomalt,<br>
isomaltitol and lactitol.<br>
In the context of the present invention, non-<br>
crystallisable composition means mixtures of polyols that<br>
form non-crystallisable syrups at 20°C with a dry<br>
materials proportion of 70% when stored in a hermetically<br>
sealed container for one month. The non-crystallisable<br>
sorbitol in the context of the invention is defined in<br>
the European Pharmacopoeia, 1997, paragraph 0437.<br>
Sorbitol syrups are widely used in the agriculture-<br><br>
foodstuffs, pharmaceutical and chemical fields. In the<br>
formulation of toothpaste, and in particular in the<br>
production of sodium bicarbonate toothpaste, the use of<br>
sorbitol syrups as humectants is possible only if they<br>
are stable in the presence of sodium bicarbonate and do<br>
not cause any brown coloration during storage. This<br>
coloration is caused by reaction of the bicarbonate on<br>
the reducing sugars: glucose, maltose, oligo-saccharides<br>
and polysaccharides. The intensity of the coloration<br>
increases with the number of units of the polysaccharide,<br>
and a molecule of maltose therefore causes more<br>
coloration than a molecule of dextrose. Coloration is<br>
also strongly accelerated by the temperature to which the<br>
syrup is exposed. It has been noted that the same<br>
intensity of coloration is obtained after storage for 10<br>
days at 45°C and after storage for 15 months at 20°C. It<br>
is preferable for these syrups to be non-crystallisable<br>
to facilitate handling and transporting them, regardless<br>
of the climatic conditions, and to assure that finished<br>
products prepared from such syrups are stable.<br>
Maltitol syrups also represent a large class and are<br>
mainly used in preparing non-cariogenic pharmaceutical<br>
and food products.<br>
Although more costly, xylitol syrups are being<br>
widely used because of their high sweetening power, their<br>
dental properties and their excellent humectant<br>
characteristics.<br>
It is known that the coloration of a polyol syrup in<br>
the presence of alkalis is related to the presence of<br>
reducing free sugars: glucose, maltose, oligo-saccharides<br>
and polysaccharides.<br>
Improving the stability of such syrups therefore<br>
entails eliminating these free sugars.<br>
Various approaches have already been investigated on<br>
a laboratory scale.<br><br>
Japanese patent JP 51.86406 offers the prospect of<br>
improving the purity of crystallisable sorbitol syrups by<br>
reducing crystallised glucose under alkaline conditions<br>
maintained throughout the reduction reaction, in order to<br>
obtain very pure sorbitol containing little non-reduced<br>
sugar.<br>
However, the above technique is of no practical<br>
benefit on an industrial scale because it requires a<br>
costly feed, monitoring and control system and the<br>
constant addition of buffer and alkaline solution during<br>
the reaction represents a penalty in terms of the<br>
subsequent purification step. The method is also<br>
relatively highly polluting because of the large<br>
quantities of reactants used. Furthermore, there is no<br>
reference to the stability of the sorbitol syrups<br>
obtained by said method.<br>
Japanese patent JP 41.12212 mentions a method of<br>
preparing sorbitol of maximum purity resistant to heat<br>
and to alkalis which entails reduction by adding hydrogen<br>
at high pressure and either adjusting the pH of the<br>
solution to a value from 8 to 10 just before the<br>
reduction reaction is completed or heating the reduced<br>
sorbitol solution, whose pH has previously been adjusted<br>
to a value from 8 to 10 by means of an alkali, to a<br>
temperature from 60°C to 90°C, followed, after<br>
decomposition of the residual directly reducing sugars,<br>
by separation by filtration, with or without<br>
neutralisation by means of an acid and with or without<br>
decoloration over charcoal, followed by purification over<br>
ion-exchange resin.<br>
The above method, which is applied to a<br>
crystallisable sorbitol solution, gives rise to<br>
considerable formation of impurities because the reducing<br>
sugars are subjected to a relatively long processing<br>
duration, of the order of five hours, and does not impart<br><br>
sufficient stability.<br>
Japanese patents JP 63.79844 and JP 71.45090<br>
describe a method of preparing polyols resistant to heat<br>
and to alkalis which entails treating for one to two<br>
hours in a hot alkaline medium an aqueous solution of<br>
polyols purified a first time by treatment with carbon<br>
black and then over ion-exchange resin, and then<br>
purifying again the solution obtained at 50°C, by passage<br>
over ion-exchange resin. The above method is intended in<br>
particular for crystallisable sorbitol syrups obtained<br>
from very pure glucose syrups. Crystallisable syrups of<br>
this kind are not suitable for use in particular in<br>
toothpaste because of their many drawbacks. Also, the<br>
above method is particularly complex because of the<br>
multiple operations it involves, and is therefore<br>
difficult to apply on an industrial scale.<br>
Patent EP 0 711 743, of which the applicant is the<br>
patentee, describes polyol compositions which are highly<br>
chemically stable in an alkaline medium and have a very<br>
low reactivity.<br>
These compositions, which are particularly suitable<br>
for use in a basic medium necessitating absence of<br>
coloration, are obtained by catalytic hydrogenation of<br>
simple or complex reducing sugars and then stabilising<br>
the syrup and purifying the stabilised syrup.<br>
The stabilisation step entails submitting the<br>
sorbitol syrups obtained by hydrogenation to oxidation,<br>
caramelisation or fermentation, so as to obtain syrups<br>
exhibiting an optical density in an S test of less than<br>
or equal to 0.100.<br>
The applicant has shown that satisfactory stability<br>
can be obtained only at low values in the above test,<br>
which reflects the susceptibility of the compositions to<br>
coloration in an alkaline medium.<br>
Aiming to improve further the performance of a<br><br>
method of the above kind, and with a view to limiting<br>
mineral and organic waste, in order to protect the<br>
environment, the applicant has, after lengthy research,<br>
developed a new method which yields non-crystallisable<br>
polyol syrups that are sufficiently stable in an alkaline<br>
medium and, by limiting purification operations, offers a<br>
high yield and reduced pollution, which prior art<br>
techniques cannot provide.<br>
Thus the applicant has found that, to obtain non-<br>
crystallisable polyol syrups that are resistant to heat<br>
and to alkalis, it is necessary to submit a sugar syrup<br>
that has undergone a hydrogenation and caramelisation<br>
step to a step of purification over at least one strong<br>
cationic resin at a temperature below 50°C, said<br>
temperature being chosen as a function of the desired<br>
proportion of reducing sugars in the final composition.<br>
The invention therefore provides a new method of<br>
preparing a non-crystallisable polyol syrup, resistant to<br>
heat and alkaline media, including a step of<br>
hydrogenating a sugar syrup and a step of caramelising<br>
the hydrogenated sugar syrup, characterised in that the<br>
hydrogenated and caramelised sugar syrup undergoes<br>
purification over ion exchange resins, said purification<br>
including at least one passage over strong cationic resin<br>
at a temperature less than 50°C, said temperature being<br>
chosen as a function of the desired proportion of<br>
reducing sugars in the non-crystallisable polyol syrup.<br>
Considerable research by the applicant has shown the<br>
importance of the working temperature on maintaining the<br>
quality of the product during purification over a strong<br>
cationic resin. The quality of the composition after<br>
purification and in particular its final proportion of<br>
reducing sugars is inversely proportional to the<br>
temperature at which it is passed over the strong<br>
cationic resin.<br><br>
Purification over strong cationic resin in<br>
accordance with the invention is therefore carried out at<br>
a temperature below 50°C, chosen as a function of the<br>
desired proportion of reducing sugars in the final<br>
composition after purification. The applicant has found<br>
that the temperature during passage over the resin can be<br>
adjusted as a function of the proportion of reducing<br>
sugars obtained after caramelisation and of the desired<br>
final proportion of reducing sugars in the purified<br>
polyol syrup. The required proportion varies as a<br>
function of the intended applications of the syrup. For<br>
preparing toothpaste, in addition to the nature of the<br>
alkaline agent present in the paste, it is necessary in<br>
particular to take into account the nature of the<br>
colouring agents used to determine the acceptable limit<br>
for resistance to coloration by the polyol syrup. Slight<br>
yellow coloration is more readily acceptable for blue<br>
pastes. The flavours used are also a factor to be taken<br>
into account when determining the acceptable limit on the<br>
proportion of reducing sugars. Thus for some bicarbonate<br>
pastes, the acceptable limit is 3 50 parts per million of<br>
reducing sugars (expressed as dextrose equivalents and<br>
hereinafter abbreviated to ppm), and for others, such as<br>
those containing pyrophosphates, proportions of up to<br>
500 ppm may suit. This is equally applicable to other<br>
pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food applications.<br>
Under optimum conditions for hydrogenating and then<br>
caramelising a non-crystallisable polyol syrup, minimum<br>
reducing sugar proportions of the order of 50 ppm to 100<br>
ppm are obtained. The applicant has found that under<br>
these conditions the maximum temperature at which a syrup<br>
of this kind can be purified over strong cationic resin<br>
is 50°C if, allowing for the increased proportion of<br>
reducing sugars in the resins, a final value less than or<br>
equal to 500 ppm of reducing sugars is to be obtained,<br><br>
regarded as being the acceptable maximum limit. Below<br>
50°C, the temperature during passage over the resin can<br>
therefore be adjusted as a function of the required<br>
proportion of reducing sugars in the final composition<br>
and of the proportion of reducing sugars initially<br>
present after caramelisation, as explained more fully<br>
later. Accordingly, passage over strong cationic resin<br>
can advantageously be adjusted to a temperature of less<br>
than or equal to 40°C, preferably less than or equal to<br>
30°C and even more preferably from 20°C to 30°C if a very<br>
low proportion of reducing sugars is desired in the<br>
polyol composition according to the invention.<br>
The purification as such is effected using standard<br>
techniques, i.e. first passing over strong cationic<br>
resin, then strong anionic resin, and then passage over a<br>
mixed bed which is an equal parts mixture of the two<br>
resins. It is also possible to modify the order in which<br>
the resins are combined.<br>
The aim of the strong cationic resin is to eliminate<br>
cations, in particular sodium coining from the sodium<br>
carbonate used in caramelisation, and the soluble nickel<br>
coming from the hydrogenation catalyst.<br>
The object of the strong anionic resin is to<br>
eliminate organic anions such as gluconate in particular,<br>
which is a degradation product from the caramelisation<br>
step.<br>
The use of a mixed bed in the final step optimises<br>
purification by palliating any leaks of ions that might<br>
have occurred in preceding steps.<br>
The preferred cation exchange resin is a strong<br>
cationic resin carrying a sulphonic type functional group<br>
SO3H used in strong acid form, for example the IR 200 C<br>
resin from ROHM and HAAS. The preferred anionic resin is<br>
a strong anionic resin such as the IRA 910 resin from the<br>
same manufacturer. The mixed bed consists of a mixture of<br><br>
the two resins.<br>
In one advantageous embodiment of the method<br>
according to the invention, to prevent excessively long<br>
residence times in the resin, with the attendant risk of<br>
encouraging deterioration of the purified polyol syrup,<br>
the purification over resins is effected at a flowrate<br>
corresponding to 1.5 times the volume of the resin column<br>
through which the syrup passes per hour.<br>
In another advantageous embodiment of the method<br>
according to the invention, caramelisation is conducted<br>
in the hydrogenation reactor, under hydrogen and without<br>
separating the catalyst, by introducing an alkaline agent<br>
at the end of the hydrogenation reaction, at a time when<br>
the pH is likely to be stable after adding the alkaline<br>
agent, and without using a buffer.<br>
Considerable research by the applicant has shown<br>
that the hydrogenation step can advantageously be<br>
combined with caramelisation in the same reactor, without<br>
adding buffer, so as to obtain a polyol composition that<br>
is stable in a hot alkaline medium from sugar syrup in a<br>
manner which is economical and also not very polluting<br>
after purification.<br>
In the context of the present invention,<br>
caramelisation means alkaline degradation of the reducing<br>
sugars of the hydrogenate, leading to the formation of<br>
corresponding enols. Alkaline agents suitable for<br>
caramelisation include strong or weak bases. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the alkaline agent used for<br>
caramelisation is sodium carbonate.<br>
The sugar syrups subjected to the method according<br>
to the invention can include in particular glucose<br>
syrups, fructose syrups, glucose syrups rich in maltose<br>
and xylose syrups.<br>
The sugar syrup advantageously contains 60% to 95%<br>
dextrose, 0.1% to 20% maltose, the remainder to 100%<br><br>
consisting of polysaccharides and oligo-saccharides, the<br>
above percentages being percentages by weight relative to<br>
the dry weight of the saccharides contained in said<br>
syrup.<br>
The catalytic hydrogenation is carried out in a<br>
manner known in the art, in a twin-jacket reactor, over<br>
Raney nickel catalysts, although any other sugar<br>
hydrogenation catalyst may be suitable.<br>
It is preferably carried out at a hydrogen pressure<br>
from 3 0 bars to 100 bars and at a temperature from 120°C<br>
to 150°C, and even more preferably at a temperature from<br>
130°C to 150°C, in order to optimise the rate of<br>
hydrogenation whilst limiting secondary reactions.<br>
Sodium carbonate is introduced into the reactor to<br>
obtain a pH from 9 to 11, and preferably from 9.5 to 11,<br>
at a time when the pH is sufficiently stable to require<br>
no buffer solution nor addition of a massive quantity of<br>
sodium carbonate to maintain the pH at that value. This<br>
is generally achieved after 90 minutes of hydrogenation<br>
under the conditions in accordance with the invention.<br>
This criterion for introducing the sodium carbonate<br>
results from studies of hydrogenation kinetics and<br>
caramelisation conditions. If the reaction medium is<br>
still rich in free reducing sugars, introducing the<br>
alkaline agent destabilises the pH, which is<br>
significantly reduced because of the conversion of the<br>
free reducing sugars into corresponding acids.<br>
Accordingly, beyond a reducing sugars proportion of<br>
approximately 0.4%, too much acid is formed and the pH<br>
therefore falls, rendering ineffective the stabilising<br>
action of the caramelisation and entailing the addition<br>
of too much sodium carbonate. It is therefore preferable<br>
to introduce the alkaline agent when the proportion of<br>
residual reducing sugars is less than 0.2%, and more<br>
preferably less than or equal to 0.1%.<br><br>
When the pH in the reactor is less than 9, the<br>
caramelisation is insufficient. When it is greater than<br>
11, the caramelisation is satisfactory but the ionic<br>
charge of the hydrogenate becomes too high, which leads<br>
to a consequential rejection of chlorides when<br>
regenerating the cation exchange resins. The applicant<br>
has found that, at a pH from 9.5 to 11, the excess sodium<br>
carbonate in the reaction medium is sufficient to achieve<br>
complete caramelisation of the sugars.<br>
The method according to the invention produces<br>
polyol syrups that are particularly suitable for use in<br>
the preparation of basic pH products such as toothpastes<br>
based on sodium bicarbonate or the family of sodium<br>
phosphates, anti-acid compositions, shaving foams or<br>
depilatory creams, or for the production of products at<br>
high temperatures, whilst achieving a previously<br>
unequalled return on investment, and a minimum level of<br>
organic and mineral wastes.<br>
In one advantageous embodiment of the method<br>
according to the invention, the syrup obtained is a non-<br>
crystallisable sorbitol syrup.<br>
The non-crystallisable sorbitol syrup obtained<br>
preferably contains at least 64 wt.% of sorbitol, at<br>
least 6 wt.% of maltitol, the remainder to 100%<br>
consisting of oligo-saccharides and polysaccharides, the<br>
above percentages being expressed relative to the dry<br>
weight of polyols present in the composition.<br>
The syrup that can be obtained by the method<br>
according to the invention can therefore be used with<br>
advantage in preparing basic pH products containing<br>
alkaline agents or treated or obtained at a high<br>
temperature.<br>
The invention also provides a toothpaste composition<br>
containing the polyol syrup that can be obtained by the<br>
method according to the invention.<br><br>
The invention is illustrated by the following non-<br>
limiting examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
A sugar syrup with the composition given below was<br>
introduced with stirring into a 20-litre twin-jacket<br>
reactor containing Raney nickel in suspension:<br>
- dextrose: 75%/dry<br>
- maltose: 8%/dry<br>
- maltotriose: 3.6%/dry<br>
- higher DP: 13.4%/dry<br>
The dry material of the reaction medium was 40 wt.%<br>
and the Raney nickel proportion was 5 wt.%, in both cases<br>
relative to the dry weight.<br>
Hydrogenation was carried out for 90 minutes at a<br>
pressure of 50 bars and a temperature of 140°C.<br>
A 3 wt.% solution of sodium carbonate was introduced<br>
for 15 minutes so as to obtain a hydrogenate pH of 10.8.<br>
The pH was found to be stable and the proportion of<br>
reducing sugars was found to be less than 0.4 wt.%.<br>
Hydrogenation was continued for 20 minutes.<br>
Then the stirring of the reactor was stopped, the<br>
contents allowed to settle for 15 minutes, and the<br>
supernatant liquor drained into a settling tank to<br>
recover the catalyst. The supernatant liquor from the<br>
settling tank was then filtered to eliminate the final<br>
traces of catalyst.<br>
The syrup obtained in the above manner was cooled to<br>
25°C and then purified over strong cationic resin, then<br>
over anionic resin and finally over the mixed bed.<br>
The syrup obtained was then subjected to a test for<br>
its resistance to alkaline agents. The test, referred to<br>
as the S test, is described in patent EP 0 711 743, of<br>
which the applicant is the patentee. The lower the value<br>
obtained in the S test (optical density less than 0.1),<br>
the more stable the polyol composition.<br><br>
500 mg of ultrapure sodium hydrogen carbonate and<br>
250 mg of a 20% aqueous solution of ammonia were added to<br>
5 ml of syrup.<br>
The result was mixed and heated in a water bath<br>
without stirring at 100°C for two hours.<br>
The solution was cooled to 20°C and its optical<br>
density measured at a wavelength of 42 0 nm using a<br>
spectrophotometer such as the PERKIN-ELMER Lambda 5<br>
UV/VIS spectrophotometer.<br>
A calibration range was produced in the same manner<br>
by substituting for the 5 ml of syrup, 3 ml of pure water<br>
and 2 ml of anhydrous pure glucose solutions with<br>
concentrations of 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 and<br>
1000 ppm.<br>
The respective absorbencies of the above glucose<br>
solutions were 0.04, 0.08, 0.120, 0.160, 0.205, 0.250,<br>
0.413.<br>
The syrup obtained in accordance with the present<br>
invention had a relatively low optical density of 0.04.<br>
This was equivalent to a glucose proportion of 100<br>
ppm/dry, which indicates very high resistance to alkalis.<br>
The method according to the invention therefore<br>
produces a non-crystallisable polyol composition that is<br>
highly resistant to alkaline and/or hot media in a more<br>
economical and less polluting way than the prior art<br>
techniques.<br>
Example 2: Influence of temperature on purification<br>
by means of ion exchange resins<br>
The syrup obtained in example 1 before purification<br>
was divided into seven fractions.<br>
The fractions were purified over strong cationic<br>
resin at respective temperatures of 20, 30, 35, 40, 45,<br>
50, 52 and 60°C (fractions A to H), then over anionic<br>
resin and finally over the mixed bed.<br>
An S test was performed on each fraction after<br><br>
purification and for each point the difference was<br>
computed compared to the original test (delta S test).<br>
The results are given in ppm dextrose equivalent.<br><br>
The results show clearly the influence of the<br>
working temperature on purification over strong cationic<br>
resin. This shows that it is possible to adapt the<br>
temperature of the composition during purification<br>
according to the reducing sugar requirements necessitated<br>
by the intended end use, which confers unheard of<br>
flexibility on the method according to the invention.<br>
Example 3: Formulation of a sodium bicarbonate<br>
toothpaste<br>
A sodium bicarbonate toothpaste with the following<br>
formula was produced using products A and F from example<br>
2 (purified over resins at 20°C and at 50°C):<br><br><br>
The toothpastes A and B obtained had respective pH<br>
of 8.4 and 8.7 in 10% solution.<br>
After storage for six months at room temperature,<br>
because of the satisfactory purity of product A, the<br>
colour of paste A had not changed.<br>
However, paste B was an unacceptable yellowish<br>
colour after the same storage time.<br>
Example 4: Formulation of anti-tartar toothpastes<br>
with sodium pyrophosphate<br>
An anti-tartar toothpaste with the following formula<br>
was produced using sodium pyrophosphate as the anti-<br>
tartar agent and product D from example 2 (purified on<br>
strong cationic resin at 40°C):<br><br><br>
The final pH of the toothpaste was 7.8 as such and<br>
8.6 after dilution to 10%.<br>
The colour of the toothpaste had not changed after<br>
storage of six months at room temperature.<br>
Syrup D from example 2 is therefore entirely<br>
suitable for use in a toothpaste in the presence of anti-<br>
tartar agent.<br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1. Process for preparing a noncrystallizable polyol syrup stable to heat<br>
and to alkaline medium, using a stop of hydrogonation of a sugar syrup<br>
and a stop of caramelization of the hydrogenated sugar syrup,<br>
characterized in that the hydrogenated and caramelized sugar syrup is<br>
subjected to purification on ion-exchange resins, the said purification<br>
comprising at least one passage over a strong cationic rosin at a<br>
temperature of loss than 30oC, the said temperature boing chosen<br>
according to the level of reducing sugars desired in the<br>
noncrystalizable polyol syrup.<br>
2. Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that the caramelization<br>
treatment is performed in the hydrogenation reactor, under hydrogen<br>
and without separation of the catalyst, by introducing sodium hydroxide<br>
at the and of the hydrogenation reaction.<br>
3. Process according to either of Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the<br>
caramelization step consists in bringing the pH of the hydrogenated<br>
syrup to a value of between 9 and 11, preferably of between 9.5 and<br>
11, whan this pH is likely to be stable.<br><br>
4. Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that<br>
the purification stop is performed on a strong cationic resin at a<br>
temperature of loss than 30oC, and than on an anionic resin and<br>
finally on a mixed bed.<br>
5. Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that<br>
the temperature for passing over a strong cationic resin is between 20<br>
and less than 30oC.<br>
6. Process according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the<br>
polyol syrup is a noncrystallizable sorbitol syrup.<br>
7. Process according to Claim 6, characterized in that the<br>
noncrystallizable sorbitol syrup has a sorbitol content of at least 64%<br>
by weight, the oligo-and polysaccharide content constituting the<br>
balance for 100%, these percentages being expressed relative to the<br>
dry matter content of the polyois present in the composition.<br>
The invention relates to a method of<br>
preparing a non-crystallisable polyol syrup, resistant to<br>
heat and alkaline media, including a step of<br>
hydrogenating a sugar syrup and a step of caramelising<br>
the hydrogenated sugar syrup, characterised in that the<br>
hydrogenated and caramelised sugar syrup undergoes<br>
purification over ion exchange resins, said purification<br>
including at least one passage over strong cationic<br>
resins at a temperature less than 50°C, said temperature<br>
being chosen as a function of the desired proportion of<br>
reducing sugars in the non-crystallisable polyol syrup.<br>
It also relates to the use of the polyol syrup obtained<br>
in the preparation of toothpaste.</td>
