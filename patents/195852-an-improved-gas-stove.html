				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a gas stove provided with means for holding the gas stove in a vertical portion.<br>
More specifically the subject invention relates to space saving gas stove provided with self locking and antilocking means for locking and antilocking the gas stove in a vertical position.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide space saver and safety oriented gas stove which is easy to clean and has the contemporary looks to match life style. The gas stove facilitates to work as well as help to clean and maintain the kitchen. It also eliminates the room for pests.<br>
In order to achieve the above objects the gas stove is provided with a pair of C shaped legs supported by the back of frame on which the stove can move axially. The gas stove is also provided with a device by which it is held in the vertical position with an automatic locking means. These constitutes some of the basic feature of the gas stove.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The conventional gas stove comprise of a rectangular frame and a gas burning system placed above it. The gas stove once placed, remains in the same position and occupies the space even when not in use. The space required for these gas stoves remains unutilised even if the gas stove is not in use. In case the space below the gas stove has to be cleaned the stove has to be shifted<br>
from its position and kept back to its original position or it has to be lifted up which is quite difficult to manage for the consumer. Further there is always an apprehension of the gas pipe becoming loose while shifting the gas stove for cleaning the space below the said gas stove.<br>
With the passage of time, the awanerness and need of safety rules and restraint of the space is increasing. For better utilization of the space it has become necessary to have a system in which the gas stove should be in a horizontal portion when in use and can be lifted to a vertical portion when not in use. Also the gas pipe should be exposed to minimum risk of leakage.<br>
The invention with various embodiments will not only be a space shaving device but also will the helpful in keeping the space below the burners neat and clean. With the high rise of cost of the gas, it is becoming very necessary to have the maximum utilization of the heat energy and to avoid the heat loss due to conduction, convection and radiation of the heat. The present gas stove has not only the advantage of space saving and cleanness but also the minimum or say nil loss of heat due to conduction, convention and radiation of the energy.<br>
Besides all these, the aesthetic sense to have a decent looking gas stove having all the essential requirement is a must for the modern kitchen. The present invention aims at overcoming all the above problems of the consumer, who is more aware and conscious of cleanliness and safety.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a gas stove, which is not only a space saving device but provides a aesthetic look to the kitchen in having the floor clean and avoiding all the dissipation of the heat energy.<br>
In the present invention there is provided a novel hinged supported center portion which facilitate the folding up the gas stove to its vertical position.<br>
There is also a self locking means for locking the stove in a vertical position. There is also means for releasing the said locking to bring the stove to its original position.<br>
A gas distribution channel is provided in the center of the frame which not allows the free flow of the gas from the gas storage device to the burners and aids to the safety due to gas leakage.<br>
In the subject invention there is provided supporting means below the said gas distribution channel for holding the said gas distribution channel in the desired position having a pair of C shaped legs provided near outer end of the frame to hold the frame.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention the gas stove is provided with a device by which it is held in the vertical portion and gets locked on its own when lifted to its vertical position. In case it is desired to unlock the device a button or d knob is pressed to enable the locking system to release the system to bring it back to its horizontal portion.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
1'he various  features of the present invention are detailed as tollows:<br>
The frame (1) of the stove is made up of stainless steel and comprises of a hollow pipe in the shape of a quadrilateral. The front end of the frame is curved (Fig 1) in such a manner so that the curved part of the frame acts as a support with the ground enabling the uncurved part to remain above the ground surface.<br>
A top sheet (3) made up of metal (Fig. 4) is placed on the top of the frame preferably in the middle of it.<br>
The metal top sheet (3) is cut on both of its longitudinal sides (Fig 4) in order to reduce the transfer of heat from the burner flame to the top sheet. The top sheet (3) is further curved at both its front of and. rear ends. The front curvature is made so as to enable the top sheet (3) to fit well over the corresponding frontal curvature of the metal frame. The curvature at the rear end of the top sheet (3) is made so as to fit well over the back support of the stove.<br>
The top sheet (3) has four holes (15) preferable provided near the concaved edges (5) for the entry of screws meant for fastening  the entire assembly to the metal top sheet (3) .<br>
Provided at the curved frontal end of the top sheet are a pair of regulators (4) which by means of a connecting axle passing through the top sheet are connected to the gas distribution pipe(16). The regulators control the amount of fuel flowing from the sources to the burners. This is preferably accomplished by means of a system of valves which operate in accordance with the manual movement of the regulators (4).<br>
The frame (1) is provided with a hollow metal channel (10) in the center of the gas stove. The said channel is supported by a pair of strips (6) placed evenly beneath the said channel having holes at the either ends for screwing the metal strips to the metal top sheet for holding the gas distribution channel in the desired position. The metal channel (10) encloses the gas distribution pipe (16) which facilitates free flow of gases from its storage device to the burner (17) . For entry of gas distribution pipe (16) there is a hole provided in the back support of the frame (1).<br>
A pair of burners (17) each having a circular head facing upwards and comprising holes for allowing the gas to come out in contact with air. The head extends downwards into a vessel like structure which is preferably curved so as to accommodate the burners (17) will within the frame (1) . The tail end of the burner is connected to the gas distribution (16) pipe meant for carrying the fuel from the source to the burners.<br>
A system of sleeves (2) is mounted on the top of the metal top sheet (3) around each burner (17) in order to support the container well on the burners (17). The said sleeves are further supported by small strips (7) . This prevent the container from coming in contact with the burner head and thus making sufficient space for the flames to spread around the container to be heated.<br>
In Fig. 7 a system of hinges (12) most preferably provided on the C shaped legs (7) is meant for enabling the movement of the frame ilong with its assembly about an axis formed by these hinges.<br>
The rear ends of the frame pipes bends inward into the hinges so as to make a robust connection between the two. The hinges (12) are made up of a durable metal and is designed to eliminate or minimize friction consequent wearing and scrabbling of the frame pipe.<br>
The frame (1) is rested in the vertical position by a self locking mechanism (Fig.8) provided within the hinges (12) . When the frame is lifted upto the vertical position the back support pipe (13) transfers load to the stand. The spring (18) comes into action and the pin (20) locks the framed) in the vertical position with the result knob (19) is moved out. When the frame (1) is to be brought back to its original position knob (19) is to be pressed and the lock provided within the hinges (12) gets released.<br>
While particular embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated and described, it would be obvious to those skilled in the art that various other changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is therefore intended to cover in the appended claims all such changes and modifications that are within the scope of this invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
