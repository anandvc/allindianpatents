				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for polymerization of olefins. More particularly it relates to an improved process of polymerization and copolymerization using a solid catalyst capable of giving olefin polymers and copolymers with high catalyst activity especially at high temperatures. Still more particularly it relates to the process using an improved metallocene catalyst supported with the magnesium halide and silica. The process for the preparation of supported metallocane catalyst has been described and claimed in our copending patent application no. NF-323/96.<br>
US Pat. No. 5,032,562, describes the preparation of a solid supported catalyst, by the reaction of dibutyl magnesium, a zirconium based neutral metallocene and a compound of a transition metal halide such as titanium tetrachloride and impregnating the said precursor on to silica in the presence onto silica in the presence of an aluminoxane activator. However, this catalyst results in bimodal distribution of molecular weights, which is not desirable in most of the applications where polyethylene is used.<br>
JP 04,96,908, decribes another supported solid catalyst prepared by reacting aqueous magnesium halides in presence of silica, metallcene and an organoaluminum activator, which shows only moderate activity towards ethylene polymerization at 80°C.<br>
Eur.Pat.No.EP 613,908, describes a silica-magnesium chloride supported metallocene catalyst which in the presence of an organoboron compound<br>
polymerizes ethylene with high yield. However, the catalyst prepared according to this method is not very stable to storage and handling.<br>
During the course of their research the inventors of the present invention have found that presence of small amounts of anhydrous magnesium chloride ( 
Anhydrous magnesium chloride commonly used as a support in high activity olefin polymerization catalyst is, often not, convenient because it is very brittle and undergoes easy attrition in the polymerization reactor. Silica is a well known support for gas phase as well as fluidized bed polymerization of olefins using titanium based Ziegler-Natta catalysts. However, when used with metallocene type catalysts silica supports show low polymerization activities. Therefore, a combination of the two, namely, silica and anhydrous magnesium chloride, offers a good balance to prepare catalysts with high activity, controlled particle size and good attrition strength.<br>
In our copending patent application no. 437/del/97 we have described and<br>
claimed        a process   for the	preparation of improved supported metallocene<br>
catalyst     which is capable of         being employed for       the polymerization	o<br>
the    olefins especially ethylene. The said    catalyst comprises of    atoms of Mg, halides<br>
more particularly Cl., an electron donor compound such as tetrahydrofuran, a neutral metallocene and a solid support based on a refractory oxide.<br>
It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide a process for polymerization and copolymerization of olefins using the said solid catalyst capable of producing high catalyst activity.<br>
