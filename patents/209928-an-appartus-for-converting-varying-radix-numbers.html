BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION	<br><br>
The invention relates to the field of data processing. More specifically, the<br>
invention relates to encoding.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Typically, mathematical and engineering systems use a decimal system<br>
and/or binary system to represent numbers and to perform calculations. Over time, alternative numeration systems have been developed for different applications. Such numeration systems include fixed-radix, mixed-radix and mixed-base.<br>
A fixed-radix numeration system has a constant radix for all positions of a sequence of digits.   In fixed-radix numeration systems, the weights of successive positions are successive integral powers of a single radix, multiplied by the same factor. Examples of fixed-radix numeration systems include decimal, binary and hexadecimal systems.<br>
A mixed-radix numeration system is a radix numeration system in which all radices of each position of a sequence of digits arc constant, but not necessarily the same. The mixed-radix numeration system is a more general numeration system in which there may not be integral ratios between the radices of all digits. For example, time is measured with a mixed-radix numeration system.  Hours arc measured in tens of minutes and minutes having radices 6 and 10 respectively.<br>
In a mixed-based numeration system, numbers arc represented as the sum of a sequence of position values.  Each position consists of a mantissa and a base. The base of a given position is constant for a given application, but the bases across positions are not necessarily integral ratios between the radices of all the positions.  For example, years are measured with a mixed-base numeration system. Years are measured with tens of months and months having bases 12:10:1.<br>
The above numeration systems are satisfactory methods lo represent numbers, but are inefficient for modeling operation sequences. The above numeration systems are also inefficient for transmission of data in some special cases.<br>

The system 100 illustrated in Figure I also includes a radix unit 180. The radix unit ISO is coupled with the processors 102 and 104.  In an embodiment, the radix unit 180 can be processes or tasks that can reside within main memory 132 and/or<br>
processors 102 and 104 and can be executed within processors 102 and 104.   However, embodiments of the present invention are not so limited, as the radix unit 180 can be different types of hardware (such as digital logic) executing the processing described herein (which is described in more detail below).<br>
Accordingly, computer system 100 includes a machine-readable medium on which is stored a set of instructions (i.e., software) embodying any one, or all, of the methodologies to be described below. For example, software can reside, completely or at least partially, within main memory 132 and/or within processors 102/104. For the purposes of this specification, the term "machine-readable medium" shall be taken to include any mechanism that provides (i.e., stores and/or transmits) information in a form readable by a machine (e.g., a computer). For example, a machine-readable medium includes read only memory (ROM); random access memory (RAM); magnetic disk storage media; optical storage media; flash memory devices; electrical, optical, acoustical or other form of propagated signals (e.g., carrier waves, infrared signals, digital signals, etc.); etc.<br>
2 is a flow chart for generating a varying-radix sequence according to one embodiment of the invention. At block 20 1 , the radix unit ISO receives a first sequence. At block 203, the radix unit I 80 determines the number of positions of a" second sequence for representing the first sequence. If the radix unit I80 determines that k+ 1 positions are necessary to represent the first sequence, then the second sequence can be described as the following: v(k)  v(k-l)   v(k-2)...v(i) ...v(l). For the  position of the sequence, v(i) is the value. The v(0) is not shown in the sequence because it can be calculated from equation 1 as follows:<br>
(Equation Removed )<br>
At block 205, the radix unit ISO determines an application value from the function p(i). The function p(i) is based on a set of rules derived for an application or set of applications. In one embodiment of the invention, the function (p)i is a constant value dependent on the application. In another embodiment of the invention, the function p(i) defines the maximum radix of the second sequence.<br>
40027f At block 207, the processor 102 determines v(i) for each position of the second sequence.  In another embodiment of the invention, the radix unit 180 performs block 207 before block 205. At block 209, the processor 102 calculates the radix for each position, designated by o(i). of the second sequence in accordance with equation 2 as follows:<br>
(Equation Removed<br>
The embodiments of the present invention can be applied to mode! or represent sequence problems related to position information. The second sequence described in Figure 2, is a varying-radix sequence in which the radix of each position of the second sequence varies according to the value expressed by the second sequence.<br>
 Figure 3 is a block diagram illustrating an example of stack manipulation according to one embodiment of the invention.  In Figure 3, an input queue 303 contains variables D.C.D. and  from left to right. The variables of the input queue 303 arc pushed into a first-in-last out (FILO) stack 301.  Items from the FILO stack 301 are popped into the output queue 305.  In Figure 3, the variables from the input queue 303 have been<br>
pushed into and popped out of the F1LO stack 301 resulting in the output stack 305 containing the variables in the order D.C.A.D from left to right.<br>
J003fr| If the stack operations illustrated in Figure 3 are represented with a binary sequence, where the value "I" represents a push onto the FILO stack 301 and the value "0" represents a pop from the FILO stack 301, then the operations resulting in the output queue 305 can be represented by the following bit sequence: 1 1 00 1 0 1 0.<br>
44HHH" In the stack operation sequence, the number of zeros occurring between consecutive ones varies. The number of zeroes occurring between consecutive ones can be indicated by v(i). The binary stack operation sequence can be modeled by four values<br>
in the following way(Formula Removed) . Since the<br>
input queue 303 and the output queue 305 only contain 4 variables, only 4 pop operations can occur (i.e., only four zeroes can occur in the binary stack operation sequence). Since the maximum number of pop operations is equal to four, then the maximum number of pop operations can be defines with equation 3 as follows:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Hence the following set of equations can be derived to determine the values of the varying-radix sequence:<br><br>
(Sequence Removed)s shown by the equation for v(0), v(0) can be ascertained from v(3). v(2). <br><br>
v(l).  Therefore, the binary stack operation sequence can be modeled by a three position <br><br>
varying radix sequence v(3). v(2), v(l).<br>
Using the previously described equation for determining o(i), the radices for each of the positions of the varying-radix sequence are as follows: o(3) = 2, o(2) = 3-v(3), 0(1) = 4-v(2)-v(3). These radices are derived with the radix equation given p(i) = 4-i In this example, the function p(i) indicates the maximum number of pop operations possible for the 1th position. For example, after two push operations, at most two pop operations may be performed. Therefore the binary stack operation sequence illustrated in Figure 3 can be modeled in a more compact form than the binary sequence 1 1 0010 10 with the varying-radix sequence 02 1 with radices 232. Every possible stack operation sequence with four variables in the FILO stack is illustrated in the table below.<br><br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Table I: Model of FILO stack operations<br>
(0035f The embodiment of the present invention provides a compact sequence with varying-radices that provides the same information as a longer fixed-radix or mixed-radix sequence. The distribution of bits in a binary sequence can be indicated with a more efficient and compact varying-radix sequence as illustrated in Figure 3.<br>
pWB*r| The embodiments of the present invention can also provide gains of efficiency in data including video data and audio data.  For example, in the multi-pulse excited linear prediction (MPELP) speed codec, an excitation sequence, which consists of multiple uniformly spaced puiscs is transmitted as a residual signal.  In the residual signal, both the amplitude and position of the pulses are determined sequentially one pulse at a time during analysis. The MPELP algorithm typically uses four to six pulses every five milliseconds. Encoding an excitation sequence with the MPELP algorithm is more expensive than classical linear predictive vocoders. The MPELP algorithm is more expensive because MPELP encodes both the amplitudes and the positions of the pulses. The embodiment of the present invention can more efficiently represent an excitation sequence.<br>
ffH)37] Figure 4 is a flow chart for encoding an excitation sequence into a varying-radix sequence and transmitting the varying-radix sequence according to one embodiment of the invention.   Figure 5 is a diagram illustrating transmission of an excitation sequence according to one embodiment of the invention.  Figure 4 will be described with reference to Figure 5.  At block 401 a 30 bi: excitation sequence is received.   In Figure 5, an<br>
excitation sequence is shown being transmitted from the audio codec 146 of the system 100 to the radix unit 180 of the system 100. At block 403, the radix unit determines the numbers of bits to be used for encoding the excitation sequence into a varying-radix sequence. The varying-radix sequence will represent the distribution of bits of the binary excitation sequence. To conform with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) G.723 Standard, the excitation sequence contains M pulses, which is six for even<br>
subframe and five for odd subframes. Hence, there are   (30 m)   possible positional bit<br><br>
distributions. For ease of understanding, we will assume that M is six. Since 219<br>
the excitation sequence instead of the 30 bits as represented by the excitation sequence.<br>
4M3&amp;1 It can already be seen that the embodiment of the present invention reduces the amount of data for an excitation sequence by 10 bits per frame.  In this example, p(i) is equal to .V-/U(/V=3fl which is the fowl number of bits in a subframe and M is the number of Direct functions in a subframe). The excitation sequence can be represented by the compact varying-radix sequence v(/W) v(M-\)...v(\).<br>
As in the above example, v(0) can be determined with the following:-<br><br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
At block 405, the radix unit ISO determines each v(i) for the varying-radix sequence. The v(i) represents the number of zero bits occurring between i bits in the excitation sequence.  In another embodiment of the invention, v(i) represents the number of 0 bits preceding a I bit.  In an alternative embodiment of the invention, v(i) represents<br>
the number of 1 bits between 0 bits. At block 407, the radix unit 180 calculates the maximum radix (i.e.,p(i)) for the varying-radix sequence from the sum of values of the varying-radix sequence as in equation 3.<br>
At block 409, the radix unit 180 calculates a radix for each v(i) in the varying-radix sequence. The radix for each v(i) is calculated from equation 6 as follows:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
 In Figure 5, the radix unit 180 transmits the varying-radix sequence to the processor 102 of the system 100. At block 411 of Figure 4, the processor 102 converts the varying-radix sequence into a decimal value. The decimal value for the varying-radix sequence v(M/) v(M-1) v(M-2)...v(l) can be determined from the following equation:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
At block 4 13, the processor 102 converts the decimal value into a 20 bit binary sequence (The compact excitation sequence").<br>
At block 4 15, the compact excitation sequence and the number of positions (determined at block 403) are transmitted to another radix unit  180.  In Figure 5, the system 100 is shown transmitting the compact excitation sequence and the number of positions to a system 501. The compact excitation sequence can be transmitted over a physical medium (e.g., Ethernet cable, coaxial cable, optical fiber, etc.). a wireless medium, or other forms of propagated signals. The compact excitation sequence can also<br>
be transmitted from the system 100 to the system 501 by a fixed medium (e.g, diskette, optical disk, etc.).<br>
Figure 5 illustrates the processor 102 of the system 501 receiving the compact excitation sequence. At block 417 of Figure 4, the processor 1 02 converts the compact excitation sequence into its decimal value.<br>
In Figure 5, the processor 102 of the system 501 transmits the decimal value to the radix unit 180 of the system 501. At block 419 of Figure 4, radix unit 180 restores the decimal value to the varying-radix sequence v(M) v(M-\) v(M-2)...v(l) v(0).<br>
At block 421, the radix unit 180 reconstructs the 30 bit excitation sequence from the varying-radix sequence v(M) v(M-l) v(M-2)...v(l) v(0). At block 423, the radix unit 180 exports the excitation sequence. Figure 5 illustrates the radix unit 180 of the system 501 transmitting the excitation sequence to the audio codec 146 of the system 501.<br>
In alternative embodiments of the invention, tasks can be divided among units in a variety of ways. In one embodiment of the invention, the radix unit 180 of the system 100 converts the varying-radix sequence to a decimal value and transmits the decimal value to the processor 102 of the system 100, which converts the decimal value to the compact excitation sequence.  In another embodiment of the invention, the radix unit 180 of the system 100 converts the varying-radix sequence to the decimal value and converts the decimal value to the compact excitation sequence.  In another embodiment of the invention, the radix unit I 80 of the system 501 calculates the compact excitation sequence into its corresponding decimal value.  In another embodiment of the invention, the radix unit 180 of the system 501 transmits the varying-radix sequence to the processor 102, which reconstructs the excitation sequence from the varying-radix sequence.<br>
Figure 6 is a flowchart for converting a decimal value to a varying-radix sequence as in block 419 of Figure 4 according to one embodiment of the invention. At block 60 i, a temporary value ("temp") is initialized with the decimal value, a loop control variable i is initialized with M(M+l being the number of positions in the varying-radix sequence received from the system 100 in Figure 5), and v(i),-o.M are initialized to 0. At block 603, the processor 102 or the radix unit 180 determines if the following conditional is satisfied:<br><br><br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
If the processor 102 or the radix unit 180 determines the conditional to be true, then at block 605 v(i) of the varying-radix sequence is incremented. From block 605, control flows back to block 603. If the processor 102 or radix unit 180 determines that the conditional is false, then at block 607 v(i) of the varying-radix sequence is decremented.<br>
At block 609, the temporary variable is updated in accordance with equation 9 as follows:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
 At block 611, the loop control variable is decremented.  At block 613, the processor 102 or radix unit 180 determines if the loop control variable is equal to 0.  If the loop control variable is not equal to 0, then control flows back to block 603.  If the loop control variable is equal to 0, then at block 615 v(0) is calculated in accordance with equation 10 as follows:<br>

[0052] The embodiments of the present invention provide a method for modeling not possible with traditional numerations systems. In addition, the embodiments of the present invention enable compact representation of sequences. Various data, such as audio data and video data, can be represented in compact form thus reducing bandwidth consumption when transmitting such data over networks.<br>
While the invention has been described in relation to stack manipulation, other embodiments of the invention provide for a data structure based on a varying-radix numeration system. Alternative embodiments of the invention can involve modeling a search sequence with a varying-radix numeration system. Therefore, the invention is not limited to modeling stack manipulation. In addition, while the invention has been described in relation to an excitation sequence, alternative embodiments could be implemented such that motion vectors of video data are represented with a varying-radix numeration system. In alternative embodiments of the invention, various aspects of video data including contrast, color, background images, etc., can be represented with a varying-radix numeration system.<br>
