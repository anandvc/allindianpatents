				<td>PVC Weep-hole Fitment with inverted filter box<br>
Technical field of the Invention:<br>
The present disclosure is related to a PVC Weep hold fitment with inverted filter box, wherein the proposed device is most suitable to be applied during any masonry construction, specially in solid plain concrete/reinforced concrete, brick/stone masonry, abutment, wing-wall and return walls to drive moisture from the back filling.<br>
The proposed PVC Weep-hole is preferably designed as a complete device to be fitted suitably in structural surfaces of a bridge/flyover etc.<br>
Back-ground and prior art:<br>
During any masonry construction work, certain small openings are purposefully left in the outer walls as an outlet for water and its vapors trapped/getting trapped inside that masonry structure. Such small holes in exterior wall cladding systems not only allow moisture/water to escape out, but also help in air pressure equalization in the cavity space drained by the weep-hole. The only problem is that these holes get blocked with passes of time due to excess fall down of mortar. Apart from this certain insects, rats, snacks and birds start residing in these holes, leading to blockage of the weep-hole. Therefore these weep-holes are usually filled with certain type weep-hole fitments. Modern conventional weep-holes employ weep-hole screens/fitments, which are typically constructed plastic or metallic pipes with certain covers.<br>
Still in the conventional weep-hole fitments, there are certain structural drawbacks, due to which these undergo blockage with time, mainly because of mortar falling or ingression of small animals etc.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to propose a new weep-hole fitment, made up of PVC (poly Vinyl chloride); wherein the proposed complete device is very long lasting, completely corrosion free, free from any ingression of small animals; wherein this proposed fitment mainly comprises of perforated PVC pipe with nylon net wrapping; inverted filter box with filter media and special nylon net cover on the box; PVC Outer end-cover housing with the housing plate, PVC based weight and associated neoprene flap; PVC socket; PVC bracket; holding brackets of inverted filter box.<br>
Another objective of the invention is to propose a weep-hole fitment integrated with an inverted filter box, which is effectively capable of maintaining its normal functioning due to effective protection from any blockage due to mortar accumulation around the filter box.<br>
Statement of the Invention:<br>
The present invention is intended to propose a new weep-hole fitment with the inverted filter box, as described herein.<br>
Summary of the Invention:<br>
Proposed PVC weep-hole fitment with inverted filter box is a device developed by a unique assembly of its main components, all made up of PVC (poly Vinyl chloride). Apart from PVC made components, the proposed device also employs nylon net wrapping/covering and a neoprene rubber flap. The proposed PVC weep-hole fitment with inverted filter box mainly comprises of:<br>
(i) perforated PVC pipe with the nylon net wrapping, (ii) inverted filter box with filter media and special nylon net cover on the box, (iii) PVC Outer end-cover housing with (a) housing plate, (b) PVC based weight , (c) associated neoprene flap and (d) dome shaped perforated PVC outer cover, (iv) PVC socket, (v) PVC bracket and, (vi) holding brackets of inverted filter box.<br>
In the proposed device, there is a perforated PVC tube of suitable I.D and O.D., deciding the thickness &amp; strength of the tube. The perforated part of the tube is properly wrapped by nylon net. At one end of this perforated PVC tube there is PVC housing cover plate, fitted properly using a PVC socket, closing that end. Inside this housing cover plate there is a circular opening with a valve arrangement. This valve is created by suitable mounting of neoprene rubber flap with a weight, preferably PVC based weight. Above the weight-neoprene flap arrangement (valve), there is a perforated PVC dome as final cover of the end. The other end of the perforated PVC pipe, covered under nylon net, is fitted inside a filter box: with the help of suitable holding brackets. Between the upper surfaces of perforated PVC pipe and inner surface of filter box there is certain type of filter media, which is preferably granules/inert material etc.<br>
Detailed description of the invention with the help of attached drawings labeled with numerical symbols is substantially done hereinafter.<br>
Short description of the drawings:<br>
Figure 1: Shows a complete schematic view of the proposed PVC weep-hole fitment with inverted filter box, covered under metallic net cover, where there the nylon net cover(s)/wrapping(s) is not shown separately.<br>
Figure 2: shows the complete schematic view of another embodiment of the proposed device where the inverted filter box with the especial nylon net cover is depicted.<br>
Figure 3: shows the complete schematic view of another embodiment of the proposed device where all important components of the proposed device are shown.<br>
Detailed description of the invention with the help of drawings:<br>
Figure 1 clearly shows a complete schematic view of the proposed PVC weep-hple fitment with inverted filter box, covered under metallic net cover. The perforated PVC pipe 1 with multiple holes 14, is fitted with the inverted filter box 2 at one end with the help of holding brackets 3 and 4. Brackets 3, 4 and 5 help in fixing the nylon net cover/wrapping on pipe 1 as well as filter box 2. At another end of the perforated PVC pipe 1, which remains at the external or outer wall of the masonry structure, is covered under a PVC Cover housing, a unique assembly of housing plate 8 (of PVC) with vertical PVC socket 11, PVC based weight 9 mounted with neoprene flap 10. At point 6, i.e. preferably at one point, the neoprene flap 10 is fixed with the housing plate 8 and again the same flap 10, at its upper surface, is mounted with a weight 9, preferably a PVC based weight, at point 13. Above this assembly of components 8, 9 and 10, there is a perforated dome shaped perforated PVC outer cover 7. Above this cover 7, finally a metallic net cover 12 is placed so that the whole assembly of the proposed device gets fixed inside the external part of the wall of masonry construction. Between the outer surface of 1 and inner surface of 2, certain type of filter media is filled.<br>
When the proposed device gets installed at the wall of any masonry structure, the end of the proposed device with inverted filter box 2, remains inside the wall, as the inner most part of the proposed device and the PVC Outer end-cover housing becomes the outer part. In such condition any fluid material whether water or moisture etc., first gets filtered by the filter box 2, filled with filter media, and then passing through the PVC pipe 1, reaches to the inner surface of the neoprene flap 10. When there is sufficient fluid pressure inside the PVC tube 1, it pushes the flap 10, mounted with weight 9 and thus this fluid material, mainly water and moisture, gets released via the dome shaped perforated PVC outer cover 7 to the outer surface/environment of the wall.<br>
Figure 2 provides a schematic view of another embodiment of the proposed device, depicting the holes 15 on the surface of dome shaped perforated PVC outer cover 7, and the especial nylon net cover 16 of the inverted filter box 2. This embodiment suggests all possibility about the length of inverted filter box 2 and the perforated tubular surface of the PVC pipe 1, that is the total perforated surface of pipe 1 along with its nylon net wrapping may remain inside the filter box 2.<br>
Figure 3 also provides a schematic view of another embodiment of the proposed device, depicting different lengths of the perforated surface of the PVC pipe 1 and the inverted filter box 2, so that the perforated PVC pipe ling 17 partially remains inside filter box 2.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
