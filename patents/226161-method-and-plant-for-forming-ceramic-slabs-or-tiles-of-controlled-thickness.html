				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
METHOD AND PLANT FOR FORMING CERAMIC SLABS OR TILES OF<br>
CONTROLLED THICKNESS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates generally to a method for manufacturing ceramic<br>
tiles or slabs, and in particular to a method for pre-forming said slabs and<br>
the relative plant for its implementation.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Ceramic tile forming methods are known comprising the following<br>
operative steps:<br>
-	depositing a continuous layer of powders on a flexible belt with which<br>
walls are associated to laterally retain the powders, and of which the<br>
upper portion slides on a flat body,<br>
-	advancing said belt through a pre-pressing station of continuous type,<br>
generally consisting of at least one roller (or a compactor band) which<br>
effects a first pressing of the powders on the flexible belt to obtain a<br>
coherent article of compacted powders, and<br>
-	subjecting the article to a second final pressing.<br>
The aforesaid method, and the relative plant for its implementation, are<br>
fully described in international patent application No. WO 98/23424, to the<br>
text of which reference should be made for further information.<br>
Subsequent improvements to this method have enabled certain<br>
drawbacks regarding compaction regularity consequent on pre-pressing to<br>
be eliminated.<br><br>
Said improvements are described in patent application RE2002A000035<br>
in the name of the present applicant.<br>
Although the method described in the aforesaid patent applications has<br>
given excellent results, it does not enable the thickness of the pre-<br>
compacted article and of the final tile to be continuously controlled to<br>
obtain a product of constant thickness.<br>
In this respect it has been noted that the slab or tile thickness can vary<br>
during the course of the day.<br>
This is imputable to factors which are also very different from each other<br>
but which taken together can substantially influence the quality of the<br>
finished product.<br>
As the pressure exerted during the pre-compaction and final pressing<br>
cycle is constant, the product thickness variations are imputable to<br>
variations in the moisture content of the compacted powder, which<br>
influence its particle size distribution, and also to wear of the powder feed<br>
outlets, which widen with consequent increase in the powder quantity and<br>
hence in the thickness of the powder layer intended for pre-compaction<br>
and final pressing.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is to overcome these drawbacks of the known<br>
art within the framework of a simple and rational solution.<br>
The invention attains said object by providing a method for forming<br>
ceramic tiles or slabs which includes controlling the powder quantity, and<br>
indirectly the thickness of the powder later to be compacted, on the basis<br>
of the thickness of the compacted article.<br><br>
In the case of continuous plants in which the powder is fed onto a belt,<br>
such as that described in patent application RE2002A000035, the object<br>
of the invention is attained by controlling the height of that side of the<br>
powder feed outlet to the belt which acts as the powder layer scraper, to<br>
control the thickness of the powder layer conveyed by the belt.<br>
This control is effected on the basis of the measured thickness of the pre-<br>
compacted article.<br>
Specifically, the method of the invention comprises the following operative<br>
steps:<br>
-	depositing a continuous layer of powders on a conveyor belt by means<br>
positioned at an adjustable distance from the belt to scrape the layer to a<br>
desired thickness;<br>
-	advancing said belt through a first pressing station of continuous type,<br>
in such a manner as to compact the powders during the advancement of<br>
the belt, to obtain a coherent article of powders pre-compacted at a<br>
determined constant pressure;<br>
-	measuring the thickness of said powder layer after compaction;<br>
-	continuously controlling the distance from the belt of that side of the<br>
powder feed outlet to the belt which acts as the powder layer scraper, to<br>
control the thickness of the powder later conveyed by the belt.<br>
According to the invention said first pressing station can either be a first<br>
pressing station suitable only for making said powder layer coherent, to be<br>
then subjected to a second and definitive pressing, or can constitute the<br>
only pressing and compaction station.<br><br>
In the first case the pressure for compacting the material in the first pressing station<br>
must preferably progressively reach a maximum value between 20 and 100 kg/cm2,<br>
and preferably between 30 and 70kg/cm2. In the second case the pressure to which<br>
the material is subjected must preferably reach a maximum value between 300 and<br>
450 kg/cm2. The invention also includes a plant for implementing the afore described<br>
method.<br>
This plant comprises a conveyor belt on which a continuous layer of powder material<br>
is created, means for laterally retaining the material on said belt, continuous pressing<br>
means of band form which enable the powder layer on said belt to be compacted at<br>
a predetermined constant pressure to obtain a coherent article of pre-compacted<br>
powders, and means for measuring the thickness of the article on termination of said<br>
first pressing.<br>
Said means for measuring the thickness of the article are preferably associated with<br>
a processor which controls the distance of the scraper means from the belt.<br>
Said means for measuring the article thickness on termination of the first pressing<br>
can comprise usual measurement transducers, or any other device suitable for the<br>
purpose. Instead, the means for controlling the distance of that side of the powder<br>
feed outlet to the belt which acts as the scraper are normal mechanical micro-<br>
regulating means, such as a controlled advancement motor operating a male-female<br>
screw combination.<br>
Further characteristics of the invention are hereinafter described with reference to<br>
preferred embodiments.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
To better understand the operation of the method of the invention and the<br>
constructional characteristics and merits of the relative means for its implementation,<br>
reference is made hereinafter to the accompanying drawings which show by way of<br>
example a particular preferred embodiment of the plant for implementing the<br>
aforedescribed method. In the example the invention is illustrated as applied to a<br>
pre-compaction plant, but can be equally applied to a final compaction plant.<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic side section through the plant of the invention.<br>
Figure 2 is a view in the direction II of Figure 1.<br>
Figure 3 is an enlarged view of a detail of the invention.<br>
Figures 4 is a block diagram of the invention.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Said figures show, for loading the powder to be compacted, a hopper 200 positioned<br>
above a belt 201 onto which the powder is discharged.<br>
The belt is driven by usual means, not shown.<br>
That side of the feed outlet of the hopper 200 facing the belt advancement direction<br>
is defined by a vertically movable wall 202 acting as scraper for the layer of<br>
discharged powder.<br>
The wall 202 is engaged, via the appendix 203 in which the female thread is<br>
provided, by a screw 204 which regulates the distance of the lower edge of the wall<br>
202 from the belt 201.<br>
The female thread provided in the appendix 203 is engaged by the screw 204, the<br>
head of which carries a gearwheel 205.<br><br>
The gearwheel 205 engages a pinion 206 (Figure 4) keyed onto the shaft<br>
207 of a controlled advancement motor 208. The motor 208 is controlled<br>
to rotate in both directions by a usual control circuit linked to a processor<br>
209.<br>
The conveyor belt 201 transfers the material onto a motorized conveyor<br>
belt 2 which passes through a station 3, which in the illustrated example is<br>
a pre-compacting station, or first pressing station, the purpose of which is<br>
to compact the powder layer to obtain a pre-compacted article of coherent<br>
material having a rectangular cross-section.<br>
This article can then be decorated and divided into blanks of suitable<br>
dimensions depending on the final product size to be obtained.<br>
The article must finally be subjected to final pressing.<br>
The pressing station 3 comprises two mutually superposed motorized<br>
compactor devices 4 and 5, one of which is positioned below the belt 2<br>
and the other above it at a distance from the belt 2 which can be adjusted<br>
on the basis of the thickness of the powder layer to be compacted and of<br>
the pressure at which the first pressing is to be carried out. Generally this<br>
pressure is between 20 and 100 kg/cm2.<br>
Each of the compactor devices 4 and 5 comprises a motorized roller and<br>
an idle roller, indicated respectively by the reference numerals 40, 41 and<br>
50, 51, about which there passes a respective band 42, 52. Between<br>
each pair of rollers 40, 41 and 50, 51 there is positioned a roller table 43<br>
and 53, consisting of a plurality of idle rollers 430 and 530. The purpose<br>
of the two roller tables 43 and 53 is to maintain the bands 42 and 52<br>
pressed to compact the layer of powder material. The roller table 53 can<br><br>
also be inclined in the direction of advancement of the belt 2 in order to<br>
make the compaction of the powders of the layer gradual.<br>
The roller tables 43 and 53 define the compaction (or first pressing) zone<br>
of the powder layer, downstream of which there is provided a<br>
decompression zone 6 in which the powder layer is allowed to expand by<br>
suitable means, in a controlled manner to prevent the formation of cracks<br>
in the compacted article.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment said decompression zone 6 comprises two<br>
superposed roller tables 44 and 54 positioned downstream of the roller<br>
tables 43 and 53 respectively.<br>
With reference to Figures 1 and 3, it can be seen that the roller table 44 is<br>
fixed and horizontal, whereas the roller table 54 is supported by a frame<br>
55 via two actuators 56 of hydraulic type which enable the roller table to<br>
be adjusted in level and also to be inclined to the belt 2 to enable the<br>
compacted powder mass to expand with a desired deformation gradient,<br>
to maintain the compaction pressure constant and to measure the<br>
thickness of the compacted layer leaving.<br>
For this purpose the rod 561 of the actuator 56 emerges at its top where it<br>
is associated with a position transducer 560 which feeds its signals to the<br>
processor 209.<br>
The pre-compacting or first pressing station also comprises means for<br>
laterally retaining the powders, these means in the illustrated embodiment<br>
being in the form of two deformable straps 8 and 9, associated with the<br>
compactor device 5.<br><br>
