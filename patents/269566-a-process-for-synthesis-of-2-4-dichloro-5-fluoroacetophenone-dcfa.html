THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED<br><br>
Field of Invention<br>
The invention relates to a process for synthesis of 2, 4-dichloro-5-fluoroacetophenone (DCFA).<br>
Background<br>
2,4-dichloro-5-fluoroacetophenone (DCFA) is a valuable intermediate used in the manufacture of fluoroquinone antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin. DCFA is usually prepared from paranitrochlorobenzene(PNCB) by the process steps involving chlorination of paranitrochlorobenzene to form dichloronitrobenzene, treatment of dichloronitrobenzene with potassium fluoride to form a fluorinated product, heating the fluorinated product in an environment of chlorine gas resulting in dichlorofluorobenzene and finally acylation of dichlorofluorobenzene by an acylating agent. The overall yield of DCFA, during the process, is largely determined by the yield of the intermediate compounds, and in particular, by the yield of the fluorinated product obtained by the potassium fluoride treatment. The yield of the fluorinated product obtained by the potassium fluoride treatment, during the conventional process, has been found to be low thereby considerably impacting the yield of 2, 4-dichloro-5-fluoroacetophenone (DCFA). It has been a practice, during the conventional process to use potassium fluoride in excess of the stoichiometric quantities, to facilitate the production of the fluorinated intermediate product. When large excess of potassium fluoride is utilized for the process, the cost is increased as well as the separation and purification of the final product (DCFA) becomes cumbersome. Further, purification procedures conventionally followed result in product losses thereby further reducing the yield. It is desirable to increase the yield of the fluorinated product obtained by the potassium fluoride treatment, by minimal utilization of potassium fluoride during the process of synthesis of DCFA and by minimizing the product losses during purification procedures.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
One object of the invention is to provide a process for high yield synthesis of 2, 4-dichloro-5-fluoro acetophenone (DCFA)<br><br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process for synthesis o f DCFA wherein the fiuorination step is carried out by highly active potassium fluoride<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a process wherein the synthesis of DCFA is carried out by using potassium fluoride obtained from potassium chloride.<br>
A further object of the invention is to minimize the losses during procedures for purification of DCFA.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The above objects are realized by a process for synthesis of 2,4-dichloro-5-fluoro acetophenone (DCFA), the process comprising first reacting 3,4-dichloronitrobenzene with potassium fluoride having bulk density in the range of 0.2 to 1.0, to form a fluorinated intermediate product, then reacting the intermediate product with chlorine to form dichlorofluorobenzene and finally acylating dichlorofluorobenzene using an acylating agent followed by purification and enrichment of DCFA by melt crystallization from the mother liquor.<br>

Example 14: Melt Crystallization of 2, 4-dichloro-5-fluoroacetophenonc (DCFA)<br>
DCFA synthesized by example 4 was subjected to melt crystallization. As the product is obtained from the crystallizer the first eutectic mixture comprising DCFB is distilled followed by a part of the distillate being added to the next batch of the feed and another part being used as raw material in the acylation step. The second eutectic mixture comprising a composition similar to the feed (crude mixture) is added to the next batch of feed. The product then obtained contains DCFA with 99% purity. Thus the product obtained is partially recycled and enhances the yield. Also as against prior art only a portion (about 20%) is subjected to elevated temperatures and thus decomposition and subsequent loss of DCFA is minimized. The process results in increase in yield of DCFA by about 6-8%.<br><br>
Example 15: Purification of crude DCFA product in lab scale crystalliser<br>
A crude product mixture containing DCFA 63gm, DCFB 26gm, DCFA isomer 5gm, higher boiler 5gm and tar lgm was charged in a lab scale crystallizer at temperature 30°C in such a way that the inner tube is dipped significantly into the crude product mixture. The temperature of the liquid was slowly reduced to temperature below 4°C by circulating cool liquid and seeding was done with pure DCFA crystalline powder (0.5gm). Finally, the temperature was reduced to temperature -15°C and mixture was kept for 7 hours at -15°C for formation of significant amounts of crystal. The residual liquid was drained out after crystal formation was nearly complete. The crystals thus obtained were melted at temperature above 20 C and stored for recycle in the second batch. Similarly, second batch was conducted and the final melts of two batches were mixed together and charged at room temperature. Then the temperature was slowly reduced to 12 C and seeding was completed at this temperature. Finally the temperature was reduced to -8 C and crystallization was conducted for 7 hrs. After completion of crystallization the mother liquor was drained out and the temperature of the inner tube was sfowfy increased" to sweating temperature of about 34°C over a period of 10 hrs. The collected mother liquor was again recycled in consecutive batches. This process was repeated couple of times to obtain a yield of more than 50% by sweating. Further the residual liquid was subjected to distillation at temperature not more than 90°C to remove DCFB and the crystallization was repeated to finally obtain more than 95% w/w yield of DCFA.<br>
Example 16: Purification of crude DCFA product in an SS crystallizer<br>
A crude mixture containing 73gm DCFA, 5gm DCFA-isomer, 18gm DCFB, 2gm high boiler and tar 2gm was charged in a SS crystallizer . The temperature of the liquid was brought down to 25°C by circulating cool liquid slowly and further seeding with DCFA crystals at the cooled temperature. After seeding, the temperature was slowly reduced to -15°C for 8hrs. Then the mother liquor was drained out at -15 C and the crystallizer was slowly heated to temperature about 33-34°C for sweating (3°C temperature raise every one hour). Finally the product with purity of 99.2%, containing DCFB 0.8% or less was obtained.<br><br>
The process of the invention results in high yield synthesis of DCFA from PNCB. DCFA synthesized during the process is isolated and purified by melt crystallization from the mother liquor resulting in continuous enrichment of DCFA in the crystals that are repeatedly formed and by continuous removal of impurities.<br>
Apart from enabling high yield synthesis of DCFA, the process of invention provides DCFA having high purity. Owing to the use of potassium fluoride in near stoichiometric quantities (not greater than 20% in excess of the stoichiometric quantitity), residual potassium fluoride is minimized and thereby contamination of the product is reduced. This enables easier separation and purification of DCFA. Further, DMSO used during the potassium fluoride treatment can be recovered and reused with reduced water content. Furthermore, the reaction waste is reduced and process efficiency is increased leading to overall reduction in the cost. During the process of the invention, the decomposition of DCFA is avoided. Further, the purification procedures as followed in the method of the invention is simple, cheaper and high yield producing, compared to purification procedures conventionally followed.<br>

These and the other modifications in the nature of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in art from disclosure herein, whereby it is to be distinctly understood that the foregoing descriptive matter is to interpreted merely as illustrative of the invention and not as a limitation.<br><br>
