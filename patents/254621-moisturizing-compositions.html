				<td>MOISTURIZING COMPOSITIONS CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/711,121, filed on 25 August 2005, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] Providing moisture to skin, hair, or nails has been the goal of many products to prevent dryness and/or promote moisturization. Some products have used materials as a barrier to prevent the moisture within the body from escaping. Other products use materials to attract moisture to the skin.<br>
[0003] It would be desirable to provide a composition that could provide a desired level of moisture along with desired effects on skin, hair, and/or nails.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY<br>
[0004] A composition comprising: an adduct of a vegetable oil and maleic anhydride; and a material chosen from a hydrolyzed keratin, hydroxyethyl urea, and/or a quaternized nitrogen moisturizing agent. Also, a method of moisturizing skin, hair, and/or nails comprising applying an effective amount of the composition to skin, hair, and/or nails. Also, a method of depositing a substance to a substrate comprising applying the composition, which further comprises the substance, to a substrate.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0005] As used throughout, ranges are used as a shorthand for describing each and every value that is within the range. Any value within the range can be selected as the terminus of the range. The use of and/or indicates that any one from the list can be chosen individually, or any combination from the list can be chosen.<br>
[0006] Unless indicated otherwise, the percentages specified herein are weight percentages based the active weight of the material in the total weight of the composition, which totals 100%.<br>
[0007] The composition includes a vegetable oil maleate. The vegetable oil maleate is an adduct of a vegetable oil with maleic anhydride. The vegetable oil maleate can be present in the composition in any desired amount to give a desired level of moisturization. In one embodiment, the vegetable oil maleate is present in the composition at greater than 0 up to about 2% by weight. In another embodiment, the vegetable oil maleate is present at about 0.55% by weight.<br>
[0008] A range of vegetable oils may be utilized for preparing the adduct with maleic anhydride including, for example, glycerin, in which the constituent hydroxyl groups are esterified with an equal or nearly equal number of fatty acid molecules. Many vegetable oils are triglycerides, i.e., those glycerides in which three fatty acid molecules are chemically bonded to the glycerin backbone. Vegetable oils suitable for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, almond, arachis (peanut), avocado, castor, coconut, com, cottonseed, crambie, jojoba, lesquerella (bladder-pod), Unseed, olive, palm, rapeseed (canola), rice bran, persic (apricot kernal), safflower, sesame, soybean, sunflower and veronia.<br>
[0009] Differences in the functional properties of vegetable oils are generally attributed to variations in their respective fatty acid constituents. Different fatty acids may be present in vegetable oils suitable for use in the invention including, for example, myristic, licanic, 12-hydroxyoleic, eleostearic, ricinoleic, palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, linolenic, arachidic, eicosenoic, behenic, erucic, palmitiolic, docosadienoic, lignoseric, tetracossenoic, margaric, margaroleic, gadoleic, caprylic, capric, lauric, pentadecanoic, and heptadecanoic acids. These fatty acid molecules can also vary in their degree of unsaruration and their hydroxyl groups can react like typical secondary alcohols by being eliminated or esterified.<br>
[0010] One example of a vegetable oil maleate is castoryl maleate, which may be prepared by reacting castor oil with maleic anhydride to form the adduct as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,225,485, which is incorporated herein by reference. In one embodiment, the castoryl maleate does not contain free maleic anhydride. The castoryl maleate adduct may be manufactured by reacting castor oil and cyclic carboxylic acid anhydride at a temperature of 75-120°C for an initial period of, for example, 4 to 24 hours, and then continuing the reaction at room temperature for at least one week to ensure that substantially all of the maleic anhydride has been reacted.<br>
[0011] In addition to the vegetable oil maleate, the composition includes a moisturizing agent chosen from a hydrolyzed keratin, hydroxyethyl urea, and/or a quaternized nitrogen moisturizing agent. Any one of these can be used alone, or any combination of these materials can be used.<br>
[0012] In one embodiment, a hydrolyzed keratin is present in the composition. Any hydrolyzed keratin can be included in the composition. In one embodiment, the hydrolyzed keratin comprises an extract of goat hair. In one embodiment, the goat hair is cashmere.

Other useful skin compatible oils may be silicone based, for example, linear and cyclic polydimethyl siloxane, organo functional silicones (alkyl and alkyl aryl), and amino silicones.<br>
[0024] In other embodiments, the composition may include any of following materials in any desired amount to achieve a desired effect in the composition (amounts that can be used in some embodiments are provided): one or more alkaline salts, for example, sodium chloride, sodium sulfate, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate and/or their equivalents (0 to 5% by weight); foaming agents, for example decyl glucoside, and/or their equivalents (0 to 3% by weight); glyceryl esters and derivatives, for example glycol distearate, and/or their equivalents(0 to 3%; by weight); sequestrants, for example, tetrasodium EDTA, and/or their equivalents (0 to 2% by weight); biocides, for example, Triclosan (2,4,4'-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenyl ether), DMDM hydantoin, formaldehyde and/or imidazolidinyl urea, and/or their equivalents (0 to 2% by weight); organic acids, for example, citric acid and/or formic acid and/or their equivalents (0 to 2% by weight); viscosity modifiers (0 to 2% by weight); fragrances and/or perfumes (0 to 5% by weight); preservatives, for example, phenoxyethanol, formaldehyde solution, parabens, pentanediol or sorbic acid (0 to 2% by weight); pearlizing agents, for example, glycol distearic esters, such as ethylene glycol distearate, but also fatty acid monoglycol esters (0 to 3% by weight); stabilizers, for example, metal salts of fatty acids, such as e.g., magnesium stearate, aluminum stearate and/or zinc stearate (0 to 2% by weight); and dyes and pigments that are approved and suitable for cosmetic purposes.<br>
[0025] Water may be included in the composition. Water can be included in an amount of 0 to about 90% by weight. In one embodiment, water is present at about 50% to about 90% by weight.<br>
[0026] In one embodiment, a moisturizing body wash composition also utilizes, as a thickening agent, a blend of PEG-150 distearate and PPG-2 hydroxyethyl cocamide for countering a decrease in viscosity associated with the concentrations of moisturizing agents utilized in some embodiments of the moisturizing body wash composition. This blended thickening agent allows the composition to achieve viscosities beyond those that could be achieved with conventional thickening agents, for example sodium chloride alone, and is able to achieve suitable viscosities at relatively low concentrations. The relatively low concentrations used to achieve the desired viscosities are also advantageous with respect to<br>
manufacturing processes that may be employed to manufacture the moisturizing body wash composition, thereby reducing the need for larger equipment or modifications and the capital expenditure associated with manufacturing the moisturizing body wash composition if other thickening agents were used. The PEG-150 distearate and the PPG-2 hydroxyethyl cocamide can be present in any amount to achieve a desired viscosity. In one embodiment, the amount of PEG-150 distearate in the composition is 0 to about 2% by weight. In one embodiment, the amount of PPG-2 hydroxyethyl cocamide in the composition is 0 to about 2% by weight. In one embodiment, the weight ratio of the PEG-150 distearate to the PPG-2 hydroxyethyl cocamide can be about 3:1 to about 1:3. In one embodiment, the PEG-150 distearate and the PPG-2 hydroxyethyl cocamide are each present at 0.0225% by weight. The PEG-150 distearate and the PPG-2 hydroxyethyl cocamide are available as a mixture from Uniqema under the trade name PROMIDIUM™ LTS.<br>
[0027] The composition can be used to moisturize skin, hair, and/or nails. The composition is applied to skin, hair, and/or nails. If the composition is a rinse off composition, the composition is rinsed off. The composition can be left on for any desired amount of time. The composition can be included in any product that contacts skin, including the oral cavity, hair, and/or nails. The composition can be used on humans or other animals. The composition can be in the form of a body wash, a shower gel, a hand wash, a soap bar, a shampoo, a conditioner, a dishwashing liquid, a skin lotion, a sunscreen, a bubble bath, an oral care product, a dentifrice, a toothpaste, a mouthwash, an antiperspirant, a deodorant, or a foot soak.<br>
[0028] The composition can also be used to apply a substance to a substrate. The substance is included in the composition, and the composition is applied to a substrate. The substrate can be any desired substrate. In one embodiment, the substrate can be skin, hair, and/or nails. The substance can be any substance that is attracted to the composition. In one embodiment, the substance is chosen from fragrances, sunscreen, pigments, insect repellents, and/or hydrophobic materials.<br>
[0029] The following examples are merely illustrative and do not in any way limit the scope of the invention as described and claimed. Unless otherwise listed, the amount are % by weight of the composition based on the active weight of the material.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
[0030] A moisturizing body wash composition can be prepared that includes hydrolyzed cashmere. The formulation of this moisturizing body wash composition is provided below in Table 1. The base used in this and other examples is shown in Table 2.<br>
Table 1(Table  Removed)<br><br>
Table 2 Base<br><br>
(Table  Removed)EXAMPLE 2<br>
[0031] A moisturizing body wash composition can be prepared that includes a hydroxyethyl urea (for example, HYDROVANCE™, commercially available from National Starch and Chemical, Bridgewater, NJ). The formulation of this moisturizing body wash composition is provided below in Table 3.<br><br>
Table 3<br><br>
(Table  Removed)EXAMPLES<br>
[0032] A composition containing a blend of glycerin and hydroxyethyl urea can also be<br>
prepared as shown below in Table 4.<br>
Table 4<br><br>
(Table  Removed)EXAMPLE 4<br>
[0033] In another example, the 6% hydroxyethyl urea in the formula in Table 3 can be replaced with 1% by weight hydroxypropyl bis-hydroxyethyldimonium chloride (COLA™Moist 200) and 1.5% by weight glycerin. All materials, except water, remain at the same amount. The amount of water is adjusted to provide for 100% by weight.<br>
[0034] The moisturizing body wash compositions having the representative formulation described above can be manufactured by combining the components identified in Table 2 to prepare a base. This base is, in turn, used as Phase A in the moisturizing body wash composition. The Phase B components are then combined and well mixed to form Phase B. Phase B is then added into Phase A with mixing to form an intermediate composition. If desired, fragrance and colorants may be added to the intermediate composition and mixed until the mixture is clear. The Phase C components may then be added as necessary and mixed to obtain a substantially uniform composition. The pH and viscosity of the composition may then be adjusted as needed to produce a final composition having a viscosity of about 12,000 to about 15,000 cPs (as measured with a Brookfield DV-n Viscometer No. 5 Spindle at 20 rpm at 25°C) and a slightly acidic pH of about 5 to about 6.<br>
