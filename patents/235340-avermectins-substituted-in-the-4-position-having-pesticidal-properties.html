a process for preparing these compounds, their isomers and tautomers and the use of these compounds, their isomers and tautomers; pesticides whose active compound is selected from these compounds and their tautomers; and a method for controlling pests using these compositions.<br>
The literature proposes certain macrolide compounds for controlling pests. However, the biological properties of these known compounds are not entirely satisfactory, and, as a consequence, there is still a need for providing further compounds having pesticidal properties, in particular for the control of insects and representatives of the order Acarina. According to the invention, this object is achieved by providing the present compounds of the formula (I).<br>
The compounds claimed according to the invention are derivatives of Avermectin. Avermectins are known to the person skilled in the art. They are a group of structurally closely related pesticidally active compounds which are obtained by fermenting a strain of the microorganism Streptomyces avermitilis. Derivatives of Avermectins can be obtained by conventional chemical syntheses.<br><br>
The Avermectins which can be obtained from Streptomyces avermitilis are referred to as A1a, A1b, A2a, A2b, B1a, B1b, B2a and B2b. The compounds referred to as "A" and "B" have a methoxy radical and an OH group, respectively, in the 5-position. The "a" series and the "b" series are compounds in which the substituent F^ (in position 25) is a sec-butyl radical and an isopropyl radical, respectively. The number 1 in the name of the compounds means that atoms 22 and 23 are linked by double bonds; the number 2 means that they are linked by a single bond and that the C atom 23 carries an OH group. The above nomenclature is adhered to in the description of the present invention to denote the specific structure type in the not naturally occurring Avermectin derivatives according to the invention which corresponds to the naturally occurring Avermectin. What is claimed according to the invention are derivatives of compounds of the B1 series, in particular mixtures of derivatives of Avermectin B1a and Avermectin B1b.<br>

The compounds of formula (I) may be in the form of one of the possible isomers or in the form of a mixture thereof, in the form of pure isomers or in the form of an isomeric mixture, i.e. in the form of a racemic mixture; the invention relates both to the pure isomers and to the racemic mixtures and is to be interpreted accordingly hereinabove and herein-below, even if stereochemical details are not mentioned specifically in every case.<br>
The racemates can be resolved into the optical antipodes by known methods, for example by recrystallisation from an optically active solvent, by chromatography on chiral adsorbents, for example high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) on acetylcellulose, with the aid of suitable microorganisms, by cleavage with specific, immobilised enzymes, or via the formation of inclusion compounds, for example using chiral crown ethers, only one isomer being complexed.<br>
Apart from by separation of corresponding mixtures of isomers, pure optical isomers can be obtained according to the invention also by generally known methods of enantio-selective synthesis, for example by carrying out the process according to the invention using starting materials having correspondingly suitable stereochemistry.<br>
In each case it is advantageous to isolate or synthesise the biologically more active isomer, where the individual components have different biological activity.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may also be obtained in the form of their hydrates and/or may include other solvents, for example solvents which may have been used for the crystallisation of compounds in solid form.<br>

In the processes of the present invention it is preferable to use those starting materials and intermediates which result in the compounds of formula (I) that are especially preferred.<br>
The invention relates especially to the preparation processes described in Examples P1.1 toP4.3.<br>
In the area of pest control, the compounds of formula (I) according to the invention are active ingredients exhibiting valuable preventive and/or curative activity with a very advantageous biocidal spectrum and a very broad spectrum, even at low rates of concentration,<br><br>
while being well tolerated by warm-blooded animals, fish and plants. They are, surprisingly, equally suitable for controlling both plant pests and ecto- and endo-parasites in humans ana more especially in productive livestock, domestic animals and pets. They are effective against all or individual development stages of normally sensitive animal pests, but also of resistant animal pests, such as insects and representatives of the order Acarina, nematodes, cestodes and trematodes, while at the same time protecting useful organisms. The insecticidal or acaricidal activity of the active ingredients according to the invention may manifest itself directly, i.e. in the mortality of the pests, which occurs immediately or only after some time, for example during moulting, or indirectly, for example in reduced ovi-position and/or hatching rate, good activity corresponding to a mortality of at least 50 to 60 %.<br>
The said animal pests include, for example, those mentioned in European Patent Application EP-A-736 252, page 5, line 55, to page 6, line 55. The pests mentioned therein are therefore included by reference in the subject matter of the present invention.<br>
It is also possible to control pests of the class Nematoda using the compounds according to the invention. Such pests include, for example,<br>
root knot nematodes, cyst-forming nematodes and also stem and leaf nematodes;<br>
especially of Heterodera spp., e.g. Heterodera schachtii, Heterodora avenae and Heterodora trifolii; Globodera spp., e.g. Globodera rostochiensis; Meloidogyne spp., e.g. Meloidogyne incognita and Meloidogyne javanica; Radopholus spp., e.g. Radopholus simiis; Pratylenchus, e.g. Pratylenchus neglectans and Pratylenchus penetrans; Tylenchulus, e.g. Tylenchulus semipenetrans; Longidorus, Trichodorus, Xiphinema, Ditylenchus, Apheenchoides and Anguina; insbesondere Meloidogyne, e.g. Meloidogyne incognita, and Heterodera, e.g. Heterodera glycines.<br>
An especially important aspect of the present invention is the use of the compounds of formula (I) according to the invention in the protection of plants against parasitic feeding pests.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be used to control, i.e. to inhibit or destroy, pests of the mentioned type occurring on plants, especially on useful plants and ornamentals in agriculture, in horticulture and in forestry, or on parts of such plants, such as the fruits, blossoms, leaves, stems, tubers or roots, while in some cases plant parts that grow later are still protected against those pests.<br><br>
Target crops include especially cereals, such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, rice, maize and sorghum; beet, such as sugar beet and fodder beet; fruit, e.g. pomes, stone fruit and soft fruit, such as apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries and berries, e.g. strawberries, raspberries and blackberries; leguminous plants, such as beans, lentils, peas and soybeans; oil plants, such as rape, mustard, poppy, olives, sunflowers, coconut, castor oil, cocoa and groundnuts; cucurbitaceae, such as marrows, cucumbers and melons; fibre plants, such as cotton, flax, hemp and jute; citrus fruits, such as oranges, lemons, grapefruit and mandarins; vegetables, such as spinach, lettuce, asparagus, cabbages, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes and paprika; lauraceae, such as avocado, cinnamon and camphor; and tobacco, nuts, coffee, aubergines, sugar cane, tea, pepper, vines, hops, bananas, natural rubber plants and ornamentals.<br>
Further areas of use of the compounds according to the invention are the protection of stored goods and storerooms and the protection of raw materials, and also in the hygiene sector, especially the protection of domestic animals and productive livestock against pests of the mentioned type, more especially the protection of domestic animals, especially cats and dogs, from attack by fleas, ticks and nematodes.<br>
The invention therefore relates also to pesticidal compositions, such as emulsifiable concentrates, suspension concentrates, directly sprayable or dilutable solutions, spreadable pastes, dilute emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders, dispersible powders, wettable powders, dusts, granules and encapsulations of polymer substances, that comprise at least one of the compounds according to the invention, the choice of formulation being made in accordance with the intended objectives and the prevailing circumstances.<br>
The active ingredient is used in those compositions in pure form, a solid active ingredient, for example, in a specific particle size, or preferably together with at least one of the adjuvants customary in formulation technology, such as extenders, e.g. solvents or solid carriers, or surface-active compounds (surfactants). In the area of parasite control in humans, domestic animals, productive livestock and pets it will be self-evident that only physiologically tolerable additives are used.<br>
As formulation adjuvants there are used, for example, solid carriers, solvents, stabilisers, "slow release" adjuvants, colourings and optionally surface-active substances (surfactants). Suitable carriers and adjuvants include all substances customarily used. As adjuvants, such as solvents, solid carriers, surface-active compounds, non-ionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, anionic surfactants and further adjuvants in the compositions used<br><br>
according to the invention, there come into consideration, for example, those described in EP-A-736 252, page 7, line 51 to page 8, line 39.<br>
The compositions for use in crop protection and in humans, domestic animals and productive livestock generally comprise from 0.1 to 99 %, especially from 0.1 to 95 %, of active ingredient and from 1 to 99.9 %, especially from 5 to 99.9 %, of at least one solid or liquid adjuvant, the composition generally including from 0 to 25 %, especially from 0.1 to 20 %, of surfactants (% = % by weight in each case). Whereas commercial products will preferably be formulated as concentrates, the end user will normally employ dilute formulations having considerably lower concentrations of active ingredient.<br>
The action of the compounds according to the invention and the compositions comprising them against animal pests can be significantly broadened and adapted to the given circumstances by the addition of other insecticides, acaricides or nematicides. Suitable additives include, for example, representatives of the following classes of active ingredient: organophosphorus compounds, nitrophenols and derivatives, formamidines, ureas, carbamates, pyrethroids, chlorinated hydrocarbons and Bacillus thuringiensis preparations.<br>

Granules:<br>
active ingredient:	0.5 to 30%, preferably 3 to 15%<br>
solid carrier:	99.5 to 70%, preferably 97 to 85%<br>
The compositions according to the invention may also comprise further solid or liquid adjuvants, such as stabilisers, e.g. vegetable oils or epoxidised vegetable oils (e.g. epoxidised coconut oil, rapeseed oil or soybean oil), antifoams, e.g. silicone oil, preservatives, viscosity regulators, binders and/or tackifiers as well as fertilisers or other active ingredients for obtaining special effects, e.g. acaricides, bactericides, fungicides, nema-ticides, molluscicides or selective herbicides.<br>
The crop protection products according to the invention are prepared in known manner, in the absence of adjuvants, e.g. by grinding, sieving and/or compressing a solid active ingredient or mixture of active ingredients, for example to a certain particle size, and in the presence of at least one adjuvant, for example by intimately mixing and/or grinding the active ingredient or mixture of active ingredients with the adjuvant(s). The invention relates likewise to those processes for the preparation of the compositions according to the invention and to the use of the compounds of formula (I) in the preparation of those compositions.<br>
The invention relates also to the methods of application of the crop protection products, i.e. the methods of controlling pests of the mentioned type, such as spraying, atomising, dusting, coating, dressing, scattering or pouring, which are selected in accordance with the intended objectives and the prevailing circumstances, and to the use of the compositions for controlling pests of the mentioned type. Typical rates of concentration are from 0.1 to 1000 ppm, preferably from 0.1 to 500 ppm, of active ingredient. The rates of application per hectare are generally from 1 to 2000 g of active ingredient per hectare, especially from 10 to 1000 g/ha, preferably from 20 to 600 g/ha.<br>
A preferred method of application in the area of crop protection is application to the foliage of the plants (foliar application), the frequency and the rate of application being<br><br>
dependent upon the risk of infestation by the pest in question. However, the active ingredient can also penetrate the plants through the roots (systemic action) when the locus of the plants is impregnated with a liquid formulation or when the active ingredient is incorporated in solid form into the locus of the plants, for example into the soil, e.g. in granular form (soil application)..In the case of paddy rice crops, such granules may be applied in metered amounts to the flooded rice field.<br>
The crop protection products according to the invention are also suitable for protecting plant propagation material, e.g. seed, such as fruits, tubers or grains, or plant cuttings, against animal pests. The propagation material can be treated with the composition before planting: seed, for example, can be dressed before being sown. The active ingredients according to the invention can also be applied to grains (coating), either by impregnating the seeds in a liquid formulation or by coating them with a solid formulation. The composition can also be applied to the planting site when the propagation material is being planted, for example to the seed furrow during sowing. The invention relates also to such methods of treating plant propagation material and to the plant propagation material so treated.<br>

Similarly to the preparation examples above it is also possible to prepare the compounds listed in Tables 1 to 3. In the tables, the       ~ww     symbol denotes the bond through which the radical in question is attached to the nitrogen atom of the skeleton.<br>
Since in most cases the compounds are present as mixtures of the avermectin derivatives Bla and B1b, characterization by customary physical data such as melting point or refractive index makes little sense. For this reason, the compounds are characterized by the retention times which are determined in an analysis by HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography). Here, the term B1a refers to the main component in which R, is sec-butyl, with a content of usually more than 80%. B1b denotes the minor component in which R, is<br><br>
isopropyl. The compounds where two retention times are given both for the B1a and for the B1b derivative are mixtures of diastereomers which can be separated chromatographically. In the case of compounds where a retention time is given only in column B1a or only in column B1b, the pure Bta or B1b component, respectively, can be obtained during work-up. The correct structures of the B1a and B1b components are assigned by mass spectrometry.<br>
