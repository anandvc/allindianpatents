Infusion Unit<br>
The invention relates to an infusion unit comprising a bag part that<br>
contains an infusion material, preferably tea leaves, and a handle that<br>
is connected to the bag part.<br>
Infusion units of this type are known, for example, in the form of<br>
traditional tea bags. With traditional tea bags, finely shredded tea<br>
material is contained in a bag part. The bag part is sealed around its<br>
entire periphery, and oh the upper side of the bag part, a small<br>
cardboard or paper tab is attached via a pull string as a handle piece.<br>
Tea bags of this type are widely used to prepare tea in individual<br>
portions and in pots. Usually, such tea bags are loaded with a fill<br>
quantity of 3.5 to 5.0 g, this fill quantity being suitable for<br>
preparing one cup of tea using said tea bag. If, however, such a tea<br>
bag is used to prepare, for example, a mug of tea (compared with an<br>
approximately 150 ml cup, a mug holds approximately 200 to 300 ml), the<br>
quantity of tea contained in the tea bag is insufficient.<br>
Furthermore, the tea contained in traditional tea bags is finely<br>
crushed, and its quality is usually far below that of a loose tea made<br><br><br>
2<br>
from high-quality tea leaves.<br>
Especially for "street vending", it is necessary to prepare tea<br>
rapidly, so that bagged tea or tea bags are always used in these cases<br>
to prepare tea.<br>
Due to the disadvantages described above, however, the tea prepared<br>
using tea bags of this type does not always satisfy the demands of<br>
consumers in terms of quality, so that street vendors are able to sell<br>
only small numbers of tea beverages.<br>
It is a goal of the applicant to make it possible for street vendors to<br>
also offer high-quality tea beverages, which approach or are equal to<br>
the quality of teas prepared at home or in good teahouses. In<br>
addition, it should be possible to prepare the tea rapidly, as is<br>
critical in street vending.<br>
Especially, it should be possible to use an infusion unit specified in<br>
the invention in combination with disposable drinking cups equipped<br>
with lids.<br>
The listed goals or the objects to be understood therein are achieved<br>
according to the invention with an infusion unit according to patent<br>
claim 1. Advantageous further improvements on this infusion unit are<br>
described in the dependent claims 2 through 9.<br>
The infusion unit of the invention is characterized in that a plate-<br>
type element, preferably made of paper, cardboard or plastic, is<br>
fastened directly to the bag part as a handle. The bag part is<br>
fastened to the handle in such a way that it is arranged between<br>
opposite ends of the handle, viewed in a direction along the elongate<br>
extension of the handle, such that when the handle and the bag part are<br>
tilted about 90° in relation to one another, the handle projects on<br>
both sides beyond a point at which the handle is connected to the bag<br>
part.<br><br>
3<br>
In the latter position, the bag part and the handle consequently<br>
together form a "T" shape, wherein it is not imperative that the two<br>
sections of the cross member of the "T" be of equal lengths.<br>
The infusion unit according to the invention is especially suited for<br>
holding loose, whole tea leaves, thereby creating the prerequisite for<br>
preparing a high-quality tea. However, the infusion unit of the<br>
invention is not limited to tea as the infusion material; in principle<br>
other infusion materials, such as bits of fruit, for example, or<br>
similar materials, can also be used. The arrangement of the bag part<br>
on the handle, according to the invention, makes it possible to<br>
reliably use the handle as a "stopper" when the bag part is hung inside<br>
a container for the purpose of preparing the infusion beverage, in<br>
that, for example, the two projecting parts of the handle are placed on<br>
a rim of the container opening, or are inserted into a lid constructed<br>
specifically for use in conjunction with the infusion unit of the<br>
invention, in a manner to be described in greater detail with reference<br>
to the exemplary embodiment.<br>
The bag part can be made of a cellulose material or any other porous<br>
material suitable for the preparation of infusion beverages, especially<br>
nylon.<br>
According to an advantageous further improvement (claim 2), the bag<br>
part is fastened to the handle eccentrically between the opposite ends,<br>
viewed along the elongate extension of said handle. In a further<br>
variant (claim 3), an arrangement is preferred that divides the handle<br>
in its elongate extension in a ratio of approximately 1 to 3. This<br>
type of arrangement of the bag part on the handle is of particular<br>
advantage especially with the preferred, provided combination of the<br>
infusion unit with a lid for a disposable drinking cup specifically<br>
designed for this purpose.<br><br>
4<br>
A further embodiment that is advantageous in this connection is<br>
specified in claim 4. In this embodiment, the handle is essentially<br>
rectangular in its basic shape, wherein the end of the handle that lies<br>
most distant from the point at which the handle is connected to the bag<br>
part is rounded. This rounding of the end of the handle facilitates<br>
insertion of the same into a receptacle slit, or makes it possible to<br>
place this end on a correspondingly shaped support surface for<br>
fastening the infusion unit in a "brewing position".<br>
An infusion unit configured as described in claim 5, in which a handle<br>
for the bag part is created by folding over one end of the handle and<br>
gluing one end of the bag part between two surfaces of the handle,<br>
which are situated one on top of another as a result of the folding,<br>
provides a particularly simple and stable construction of the infusion<br>
unit of the invention, especially the point at which the handle and the<br>
bag part are connected. Rather than gluing, the end of the bag part<br>
can also be fastened in the fold of the handle in some other way, for<br>
example via stitching.<br>
Another further improvement (claim 6) provides that the folded section<br>
of the handle forms a gripping section for grasping the infusion unit.<br>
This end is doubled as a result of folding, which also serves to<br>
stabilize it, forming a more stable gripping section than at the other<br>
end of the handle.<br>
Preferably, the handle is wider in a lateral dimension, measured<br>
crosswise to the direction of the elongate extension, than the bag<br>
section fastened to it, and in this direction projects beyond the bag<br>
part on both sides. This advantageous further improvement specified in<br>
claim 7 makes it possible to position the handle on a support or guide<br>
surface in the area in which the bag part lies. The bag unit is<br>
advantageously a flat bag (claim 8). This flat bag is preferably<br>
arranged with its elongate extension crosswise to the elongate<br><br>
5<br>
extension of the handle, and is fastened to the handle in this<br>
orientation.<br>
Preferred dimensions of the infusion unit are specified in claim 9.<br>
According to this claim, the bag unit is approximately 100 mm - 130 mm<br>
long, and approximately 50 mm wide. The handle is approximately 80 mm<br>
long and approximately 54 mm wide, with the first end that extends<br>
beyond the point at which the bag part is connected to the handle part<br>
being approximately 20 mm long and the second extending end being<br>
approximately 60 mm long.<br>
Finally, a further advantageous embodiment of the invention (claim 10)<br>
provides that a fold extends in the direction of the elongate extension<br>
of the handle, approximately centered over the entire length of the<br>
latter. The advantage of this fold is that the infusion unit of the<br>
invention can be used, for example, to brew an infusion beverage in a<br>
mug, without the risk that the infusion unit placed in the mug will<br>
slip completely into the mug when liquid is poured over it. To<br>
accomplish this, the handle of the infusion unit is pressed together<br>
slightly along the fold, so that, rather than the flat, planar shape,<br>
it is approximately triangular in cross section. The longer section of<br>
the handle then hangs over the rim of the mug. The angled shape allows<br>
the handle to better fit the round outer edge of the mug, making it<br>
harder for it to slip in.<br>
Further advantages and characterizing features of the invention are<br>
revealed in the following description of an exemplary embodiment, with<br>
reference to the attached set of figures. The figures show:<br>

In the figures, each of which schematically illustrates the described<br>
exemplary embodiment, equivalent elements are designated by the same<br>
reference symbols. The representations in the figures do not serve to<br>
limit the scope of the invention, nor does the following description of<br>
the exemplary embodiment; the scope of the invention is defined solely<br>
by the patent claims. The following description of the exemplary<br>
embodiments is intended solely for purposes of explanation and to<br>
improve understanding of the invention.<br>
In the figures, an infusion unit of the invention is generally<br>
designated by the numbers 20 or 120. The infusion unit is generally<br>
comprised of a handle 22 or 122 and a bag part 21 in the form of a flat<br>
bag fastened directly to said handle. The bag part 21 is filled with<br>
an infusion material, preferably loose tea leaves. The bag part 21 is<br>
made of a nylon material. The bag part 21 is produced by cutting off a<br><br>
7<br>
section of a tubular continuous band, closing one side of the bag part<br>
21 with a row of stitching 28, filling it with the infusion material<br>
and closing the opposite end of the bag part 21 with another row of<br>
stitching 29. The dots at the center section of the bag part 21 are<br>
used to indicate that the nylon material is porous, to enable<br>
penetration of the same by an infusion liquid, for example hot water.<br>
In this manner it is ensured that the infusion material will come in<br>
contact with the infusion liquid, allowing it to act on said material<br>
to create an infusion beverage.<br>
The handle 22 or 122 is made of a flat material, especially thin<br>
cardboard.<br>
In Fig. 4, a blank for a first exemplary embodiment of the handle 22 is<br>
shown. There it is apparent that a fold designated by the number 25<br>
extends crosswise to the handle 22, with grooves 26 and 27 being<br>
provided to each side of the fold 25. To attach the handle 22 to the<br>
bag part 21, in the areas between the fold 25 and the grooves 26 and<br>
27, adhesive is applied to an upper side of the blank for the handle<br>
22. A crosswise edge of one end of the bag part 21 is then placed on<br>
the fold 25, and the blank is folded along the fold 25 and bent around<br>
the bag part 21. In this manner, the bag part 21 is glued to the<br>
handle 22.<br>
In Fig. 8, an alternative embodiment of a handle 122 is shown. This<br>
also has a fold 125 that extends crosswise to the handle 122. This<br>
exemplary embodiment lacks grooves that would correspond to the grooves<br>
26 and 27 represented in the exemplary embodiment of Fig. 4. Instead,<br>
this embodiment has a fold 128 that extends in the lengthwise direction<br>
of the handle 122 (i.e. in the direction of its elongate extension).<br>
This fold extends perpendicular to the first fold 125 and lies<br>
approximately at the center of the handle 122, viewed across its width.<br>
The fold 128 is also indicated in Fig. 6 and 7, in which an exemplary<br><br>
8<br>
embodiment that is equipped with the handle 122 shown in Fig. 8<br>
(infusion unit 120) is illustrated. The fold 128 provides a more<br>
secure positioning of the infusion unit of the invention when it is<br>
used for brewing an infusion beverage in a mug or a similar container.<br>
In such cases the handle 122 can be bent along the fold 128, and<br>
thereby "angled". In this position, it can be better adjusted to fit<br>
the outer shape of a mug or similar container, and, when hung over the<br>
rim of the mug to hold the bag part 21, will tend not to slip into the<br>
mug or the other brewing container when a brewing liquid is poured over<br>
the contents of the bag part 21.<br>
The manner in which the bag part 21 is connected to the handle 122 is<br>
similar to what was described above in reference to the exemplary<br>
embodiment of Figures 1, 2 and 4. Here again, by folding one end of<br>
the handle 122 along the fold 125, an overlapping area is created, in<br>
which one end of the bag part 21 is glued.<br>
As is apparent, especially, from Fig. 1 and 2 or 6 and 7, respectively,<br>
the handle 22 or 122 is wider than the bag part 21, wherein the bag<br>
part 21 is arranged centered on the handle 22 or 122, so that an edge<br>
of the handle 22 or 122 of approximately equal width projects on each<br>
side of the bag part 21. With this arrangement, in connecting the bag<br>
part 21 to the handle 22 or 122, the two surfaces of the handle 22 or<br>
122, at least in the extended area of the handle 22 or 122, are glued<br>
directly to one another, which adds to the sturdiness of this<br>
attachment.<br>
With the above-described connection between the bag part 21 and the<br>
handle 22 or 122, the handle 22 or 122 forms a supporting section 24 or<br>
124 and a shorter gripping section 23 or 123, for two extending<br>
sections that extend beyond the point at which the handle 22 or 122 is<br>
connected to the bag part 21, the cardboard material of the handle 22<br><br>
9<br>
or 122 being doubled in said gripping section due to the folding along<br>
the fold 25 or 125. The supporting section 24 or 124 has a rounded<br>
end, the background of which will be described in greater detail in<br>
what follows.<br>
The bag part 21 is not centered on the handle 22 or 122, i.e. the<br>
section 23 or 123 and the supporting section 24 or 124 are of unequal<br>
lengths. In the exemplary embodiments, the gripping section 23 or 123,<br>
measured up to the point of connection with the bag section 21, is<br>
approximately 20 mm long, and the supporting section 24 or 124 has a<br>
correspondingly measured length of approximately 60 mm. The point of<br>
connection between the bag part 21 and the handle 22 or 122 therefore<br>
divides the latter in a ratio of approximately 1 to 3. In the<br>
exemplary embodiment shown, the bag part 21 is approximately 50 mm<br>
wide, and the handle is approximately 54 mm wide. With this, the<br>
overhang of the handle 22, viewed in a crosswise direction, is<br>
approximately 2 mm to both the right and the left of the bag part. The<br>
bag part is approximately 110 mm long.<br>
In Fig. 5a through 5c, a preferred use of the infusion unit of the<br>
invention is illustrated in conjunction with a lid 1 for a disposable<br>
drinking cup.<br>
The lid 1 has a base plate 2, which during use is turned toward the<br>
drinking cup, and a cover 3 arranged above the base plate 2. Between<br>
this base plate 2 and the cover 3, and within a peripheral side panel<br>
4, a receptacle space 5 is formed. Approximately at the center of the<br>
base plate 2, an essentially rectangular opening 6 is provided, and in<br>
the cover 3 or between the cover 3 and the rim of the lid 1, a slit-<br>
type opening 7 is provided in the area near the rim. This slit-type<br>
opening 7 is covered by a tab 13 that is part of the cover 3. In the<br>
area opposite the slit-type opening 7, the base plate 2 forms a support<br>
surface 10.<br><br>
10<br>
The infusion unit 20 or 120 of the invention is especially well suited<br>
for use in combination with this lid 1, to enable preparation of a<br>
relatively high-quality infusion beverage, especially tea, for fast-<br>
food street vending. To accomplish this, first the infusion unit 20 or<br>
120 of the invention is threaded into the lid 1. This is shown in Fig.<br>
5a and 5b. With the gripping section 23 or 123, the infusion unit of<br>
the invention is guided through the opening 6 in the base plate 2 of<br>
the lid 1, so that the gripping section 3 [sic] passes through the<br>
slit-type opening 7. The gripping section 23 or 123, and thereby the<br>
handle 22 or 122, is then drawn far enough through the slit-type<br>
opening 7 that the supporting section 24 or 124 can be pulled through<br>
the opening 6 into the receptacle space 5 of the lid 1. The handle 22<br>
or 122 is then tilted and pushed back into the receptacle space until<br>
the supporting section 24 or 124 of the handle 22 or 122 rests on the<br>
support surface 10. Because the entire lid 1 is circular in shape, and<br>
therefore the support surface 10 also has a partially circular outer<br>
contour, the supporting section 24 or 124 has a rounded outer edge, as<br>
described above.<br>
In the position shown in Fig. 5b, when the lid 1 or the unit formed by<br>
the lid 1 and the infusion unit 20 or 120 is placed on a drinking cup<br>
filled with an infusion liquid, the infusion unit 20 or 120 of the<br>
invention can reach into the infusion liquid, thereby acting to prepare<br>
an infusion beverage.<br>
After a predetermined period of infusion time, the bag part 21 of the<br>
infusion unit 20 or 120 must be removed from the infusion liquid. This<br>
can be accomplished in the combination of the infusion unit 20 or 120<br>
of the invention represented in Fig. 5c. When the infusion period has<br>
ended, the gripping section 23 or 123 of the handle 22 or 122 is<br>
grasped and pulled in the direction of the arrow shown in Fig. 5c. The<br>
bag part 21 is thereby removed from the infusion liquid, and is<br><br>
11<br>
pulled through the opening 6 into the receptacle space 5. With this,<br>
the bag part 21 is compressed and "wrung out" as a result of pressure<br>
between the base plate 2 and the supporting section 24 or 124 of the<br>
handle 22 or 122. If the gripping section 23 or 123 or the handle 22<br>
or 122 is pulled as far as it will go out of the slit-type opening 7,<br>
the bag part 21 of the infusion unit 20 or 120 of the invention is<br>
almost completely held in the receptacle space 5, in any case enough<br>
that it is no longer in contact with the infusion liquid in the<br>
drinking cup. In this manner, further influence of the bag part or the<br>
infusion material in the bag part on the infusion liquid is prevented.<br>
If the bag part 21 contains tea, the tea beverage prepared in the<br>
drinking cup is thereby prevented from becoming excessively bitter from<br>
brewing too long.<br>
The infusion unit of the invention is not limited in its use to the<br>
interaction with the lid 1 described in Fig. 5a to 5c, and can also be<br>
used without such a special lid to prepare infusion beverages in<br>
beverage containers. The variants shown in Figures 6 through 8 are<br>
especially suited for this.<br><br>
