THE PATENT ACT, 1970<br><br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(SE SECTION 10)<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Maharashtra	Nationality - INDIAN<br><br>
The following specification particularly described ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
The present invention is related to Battery operated vehicle. The whole invention is .divided in ten sections.<br><br>
INVERTER SECTION : (See Fig. No. 1)<br>
Pulse Generator, Driver, Power Driver Section's are described in Inverter Section.<br>
An RC coupled oscillator has been chosen for developing the gate drive for the final MOSFET power amplifier circuit as it is inherently stable. There are two basic configurations : high pass &amp; low pass.<br>
The low pass type is generally preferred because the feed back network attenuates harmonics of the fundamental frequency, resulting in purer sine way output.<br>
According the low frequency model has been adopted here, which as resistor In series arm and capacitors in the parallel arms. The applicable formulas tor the given configuration are<br>
(a)   Frequency <br>
Where C denotes shut arm capacitance and R the series arm resistance values<br><br>

An RC coupled oscillator has been chosen for developing the gate drive for the final MOSFET power amplifier circuit as it is inherently stable. There are two basic configurations: high pass &amp; low pass.<br><br>
Where C denotes shut arm capacitance and R the series arm resistance values<br>
The low pass type is generally preferred because the feed back network attenuates harmonics of the fundamental frequency, resulting in purer sine way output. According the low frequency model has been adopted here, which as resistor in series arm and capacitors in the parallel arms. The applicable formulas for the given ' configuration are<br><br>
(b)   Minimum required current gain = 56 (in common emitter configuration for sustaining oscillations).<br>
As amplitude of sine wave output from transistor is quite low, it is amplified by transistor (T2 &amp; T3). The collecter load for transistor T3 is a drive transformer. Capacitor (C7) was test selected for the optimum pulse shape and amplitude. The value of capacitor (C7) would depend upon the driver transformer used, as its parameter may differ widely from one manufacturer to the other.<br>
With this circuit, as sine wave with a peak amplitude of 6 volts across secondary of driver transformer could be observed during testing. Phas^-splitting^ (T80°) of the output across secondary of driver transformer'faken place because of transformer action. The centre tap of secondary winding of transformer (XI) is connected to positive rails via 4.7 kilo-ohms resistor, while two ends are connected to amplifier comprising transistor (T4 &amp; T5) for rasing the level of the input 50Hz signal to around 10 volt peak.<br>
The 50 Hz sine wave outputs from transistor amplifier (T4 &amp; T5) is applied to base terminal of transistor (T7 &amp; T8). This transistor (T7 &amp; T8) amplify signal and fed to power Amplifier section.<br>
The power amplifier section has two sets of power MOSFET connected in parallel for push-pull operation. These MOSFET come with integral protective diode between source and drain. At 50 Hz we are not utilising high switching speed capability of MOSFET, we are utilising their low driving power capability. Fast-recovery diodes in conjuction with parallel combination of resistor and capacitor are used as free-wheeling diode, current limiting resistor and speed-up capacitor respectively. Zener diode (D3, D4 &amp; D5, D6) are used for protection between gate and source. MOSFET's are very prone to get damaged due to voltage stresses / spikes in excess of their rated values. Hence all precautions are taken against their occurance.<br><br>
An RC Coupled oscillator is use to produce oscillation. This oscillation is further amplified by transistor (T2 &amp; T3). Transistor (T3) give output by inducting transformer (XI). The output of transformer (XI) is further amplified by transistor (T4, T8 &amp; T5, T7)' and fed to power driver section through diode. This diode allow positive half cycle to pass. This positive half cycle is amplify by the MOSFET (T6 to T16), other positive half is amplify by the MOSFET (T17 to T27). At a same time one positive half pulse get to MOSFET (T6 to T 16) just next other positive half pulse get to MOSFET (T17 to T27). This high speed switching induce high voltage across step-up transformer (X2)<br>
Batter level Indicator Section (See fig. No. 2 &amp; 3) ; IC LM 3914 is used in dot mode to display the battery voltage and also to operate the circuit low to over charged condition of battery voltage with the help of preset, we can set the lower limit.<br>
Ten LED are used for voltage indication. The consecutive LEDs thus indicate a voltage difference of 0.5 to 0.7V. We may use different coloured LEDs to indicate low, normal and high voltage range. Pin 5 is use to set upper voltage limit and Pin 4 is use to set lower limit. This upper &amp; lower limit is set with the help of preset. This limit is divied in 10 stage and give 10 different output, this output is fed to transistor though diode and invertor gate. The upper limit output given to other transistor to operate transistor via SCR.<br>
Two IC's are use in two different circuit and output is given to corresponding<br>
transistor. This transistor operates SCR for charging batteryl&amp; other battery 2 to<br>
discharging.	<br>
In this way, one battery 1 is in charging mode is monitored by the IC1 and other battery 2 which is in discharging mode is monitored by the IC5. This charging and discharging process is done alternet.<br><br>
BATTERY : The battery has property of charging and discharging time is same. The anode is made of Ag2 02 (Silver oxide) and cathode of Zn (Zinc). The electrolyte is KOH (25%) in the from of paste, wettable is thin semipenneable membrance coverd by cadmium power.<br>
Active   materials   are   separated   by   wettable   and   semipenneable   organic membrance    as cellophane, a poly-propylene with absorberts like    nylon or rayon. On complete charge, the battery shows 1.82 V. per cell. 1}    Reaction during charge &amp; discharge :<br>
Ag202 + 2 Zn + 2 KOH «-&gt; 2Ag + 2 KOH + Zn02<br>
On discharge Ag9 02 becomes Ag (silver) &amp; Zn (Zinc becomes potassium ziricate)<br>
For reliability, NaOH (Sodium Hydroxide) is used as an electrolyte, For longer life, Zinc is replaced with cadmin. It must stored at 32° - 90° f temperature.<br>
CHARGING LEVEL MONITOR SECTION:<br>
This project contains two battery. So, to monitor charging and discharging<br>

from IC 1 3914 and fed to switching IC 14 to 25, in forward order Zl to Z10 (Low<br>
to high level).<br>
Ten different outputs are taken from IC5 3914 and fed to switching IC 14 to 25<br>
in reverse order Zl 1 to 20 (high-to low level). This switching IC 14 to 25 operated<br>
on basic of Input voltage and fed to op-amp IC 5 to IC 13 &amp; IC 24 741 to campaired<br>
voltage. After comparing voltage and found equal, output is giveri to transistor<br>
through invert gate. This invertgate invert the volt (e.g. 0 to 1, 1 to 0) that's mean's<br>
output from op-Amp is inverted and become zero is fed to transistor TR 52 base<br>
terminal fcln absen&amp;of base bias voltage, transistor TR 52 stop conducting, as a<br>
result, SCR stop Conducting but at a same time IC 6 741 Compaires the input and<br><br>
not found equal &amp; hence output is Zero. This output is given to transistor through invertgate. This invertgate invert the voltage and fed to transistor TR 53 base terminal. As soon as base to emitter forward bias voltage gets, transistor TR 53 Start Conducting as a result SCR5 start conducting. IC6 741 Op-Amp Campaires input condition, as soon as, input voltage found<br>
equal, output is high and fed to invert gate. This invertgate invert the voltage and<br>
give zero voltage to transistor TR 53 base terminal and in absent of forward bais<br>
voltage, transistor TR 53 stop conducting, same time IC 7 Op-Amp compaires<br>
voltage and not found equal, output is zero, this zero output is fed though invert<br>
gate and become one. This one voltage to transistor TR 54 and transistor start<br>
