COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
A RAS-FARNESYLTRANSFERASE INHIBITOR COMPLEX<br>
BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY, a Delaware corporation of P.O. Box 4000, Princeton, New Jersey 08543-4000, United States of America,<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a ras-farnesylttansferase inhibitor complex having improved water-solubility and stability, which is formed from ras-farnesyltransferase inhibitors, such as (R)-7-cyano-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-l-(lH-imidazol-4-ylmethyl)-3-(phenylmethyl)-4-(2-thienyIsuIfonyI)-lH-l,4-benzodiazepine and sulfobutyIether-7-|3-cyclodextrin or to (R)-7-cyano-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-l-(lH-imidazol-4-ylmethyl)-3-(phenylmethyl).4-(2-thienylsulfonyl)-lH-l,4-benzodiazepine and 2-hydroxypropyl-{J-cydodextrin, and to methods of forming such complex. The ras-famesyltransferase inhibitors are useful as anti-tumor agents. The complex is also useful as an anti-tumor agent.<br>
Background of the Invention Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligosaccharides obtained from starch, formed of six glucose units (a-cyclodextrin), seven glucose units (B-cyclodextrin) or eight glucose units (y-cyclodextrin). They are known to form inclusion compounds with smaller molecules which fit entirely or at least partially into the 5-8 A cyclodextrin cavity, Saenger, W., "Cyclodextrin Inclusion Compounds in Research and Industry, "Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 19, 344-362 (1980).   On page 351, Saenger indicates that <x-cyclodextrin forms complexes with water methanol polyiodide iodine krypton n-propanol p-iocbaniline dimethyl sulfoxide and m-nitrophenol methyl orange prostaglandin e potassium acetate p-cyclodextrin p-iodophenol></x-cyclodextrin>
-2-<br><br>
LD148a<br>
diiodobenzoic acid, p-nitroacetanilide; and y-cyclodextrin forms complexes with propanol/water and water.<br>
In addition, Saenger indicates on page 357 that p-cyclodextrin increases stabilization of benzocaine, procaine, atropine, aspirin, nitroglycerin, allicin, phenylbutazone, salicyclic acid, ascaridole, the ether ester of chaulmoogric acid, linoleic acid and indomethacin, and cyclodextrins increase water-solubility of fatty acids, amines such as procaine, lidocaine, meperdine, adipherine, steroids such as cortisone acetate and testosterone, hydroxybenzoic acid, benzocaine, aspirin, p-aminobenzoic acid, tetracycline, sulfadiazine, morphine, vanillin, ephedrine, sorbic acid, phenyl-substituted carbonic acids, ketoprofen, other antipyretic agents, vitamin D3, coumarin anticoagulants, sulfonamides and barbiturates.<br>
However, p-cyclodextrin shows nephrotoxicity and membrane destabilizing properties. Because of the safety concerns with p-cyclodextrins, numerous chemical modifications of the cyclodextrins have been made. The different types of p-cyclodextrins are alkylated cyclodextrins, hydroxyalkylated cyclodextrins, carboxymethyl cyclodextrins and the sulfoalkylether cyclodextrins which include sulfobutylether (SBE) p-cyclodextrins with degrees of substitution on 4 and 7 positions of P-cyclodextrin. The specific product in the last group includes captisol®, an SBE 7-P-cyclodextrin (SBE-CD). The specific product in the hydroxyalkylated cyclodextrins include 2-hydroxypropyl-P-cyclodextrin<br>
(HPCD).<br>
U. S. Patent No. 4,371,673, issued February 1, 1983, discloses two types of water soluble cyclodextrin complexes of retinoid-polymers and complexes of retinoids with ether type derivatives of cyclodextrins.<br>

U. S. Patent No. 4,596,795, issued June 24, 1986, discloses the administration of sex hormones, particularly testosterone, progesterone and estradiol in the form of their complexes or inclusions with specific derivatives of cyclodextrins by the subungual or buccal route resulting in effective transfer of these hormones into the systemic circulation, followed by only gradual elimination. The derivatives of cyclodextrins must carry one or several substituents, each containing one or several hydroxy group. Specially preferred are the complexes of hydroxypropylbetacyclodextrin and poly-beta-cyclodextrin.<br>
U. S. Patent No. 4,727,064, issued February 23, 1988, is directed to the method of conversion of drug compositions which themselves are crystalline and of low water-solubility into intrinsically amorphous complexes which have improved pharmaceutical properties. This conversion is achieved by inclusion of the above drug compositions into water-soluble, multi-component mixtures of cyclodextrin derivatives. The cyclodextrin derivatives which are used are hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin, dihydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin, carboxymethyl-beta-cyclodextrin, etc.<br>
U. S. Patent No. 5,134,127, issued July 28, 1992, discloses sulfoalkyl ether cyclodextrin derivatives and their use as solubilizing agents for water insoluble drugs for oral, intranasal or parenteral administration. It also discloses a pharmaceutical composition wherein a drug is complexed to a sulfobutylether-P-cyclodextrin. The drug is selected from the group consisting of amobarbital, ampicillin, aspirin, beclomethasone, benzocaine, testosterone, etc.<br>
U. S. Patent No. 5,376,645, issued December 27, 1994, also discloses sulfoalkylether cyclodextrin derivatives and their use as solubilizing agents for water insoluble drugs for oral, intranasal or parenteral administration. It also discloses a composition wherein a drug<br><br>
LD148a<br>
is complexed to a sulfobutyl ether-B-cyclodextrin. The drugs used are identical to the drugs disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 5,134,127. Ras-farnesyltransferase inhibitors of the formula I<br><br>
are potential anti-tumor agents having poor water-solubility and stability. Accordingly, ras-farnesyltransferase inhibitors which have improved water-solubility and stability would be a desirable addition to the anti¬tumor field.<br>

LD148a<br>
A number of other parenteral formulations of the ras-farnesyltransferase inhibitor (R)-7-cyano-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-l-(lH-imidazol-4-ylmethyl)-3-(phenylmethyl)-4-(2-thienylsulfonyl)-lH-l,4-benzodiazepine (compound I) with cosolvents and surfactants were evaluated. The inhibitor (R)-7-cyano-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-l-(lH-imidazol-4-ylmethyl)-3-(phenylmethyl)-4-(2-thienylsulfonyl)-lH-l,4-benzodiazepine exhibited good solubility of greater than 10 milligrams per milliliter in aqueous formulations containing a mixture of 10% ethanol and .10% Cremophor or 10% Tween 80 alone. However, these formulations have a number of disadvantages, which are: the inability to be buffered because of increased sensitivity to ions resulting in precipitation of the ras-famesyltransferase inhibitor, the inability to be diluted which is required for intravenous administration and which causes pH variations and precipitation of the inhibitor and the toxicity of the surfactants requiring the use of premedication in the clinic. The premedication problem is often associated with the use of surfactants like Tween 80 and Cremophor.<br>
Examples of other ras-farnesyltransferase inhibitors are (R)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-l-(lH-imidazol-4-ylmethyl)-4-phenylsulfonyl)-3-(phenylmethyl)- 1H-1,4-benzodiazepine-7-carbonitrile;<br>

Corporation, USA. 2-Hydroxypropyl-P-cyclodextrin is available from American Maize Company, U.S.A.<br>
In general, the complex of the invention will include a molar ratio of ] the ras-farnesyltransferase inhibitor of the formula I to cyclodextrin of 1:2 I or higher at pH values of 3 to 9.<br>
The complex of ras-farnesyltransferase inhibitor and sulfobutylether-7-|3-cyclodextrin or 2-hydroxypropyl-p-cyclodextrin may be formed by forming an aqueous solution of sulfobutylether-7-P-cyclodextrin or 2-hydroxypropyl-p-cyclodextrin and adding the freebase or various salts of the ras-farnesyltransferase inhibitor to it with stirring and adjusting the pH with an appropriate acid or well-known aqueous buffers to the desired pH value.<br>
In a preferred method, in accordance with the present invention, the complex of the invention is formed by forming an aqueous solution of 5 grams of the sulfobutylether-7-P-cyclodextrin or 2-hydroxypropyl-P-cyclodextrin in 15 milliliters of deionized water with stirring for thirty minutes at room temperature. The pH of the solution is adjusted with hydrochloric acid to 2 or 3. To this stirred solution is added 500 milligrams of the ras-farnesyltransferase inhibitor (R)-7-cyano-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-l-(lH-imidazol-4-ylmethyl)-3-(phenylmethyl)-4-(2-thienylsulfonyl)-lH-l,4-benzodiazepine and after the addition of the inhibitor, the solution is additionally .stirred, with pH being adjusted to 4 or 4.5 with dilute hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. Then the solution is filtered using a 0.22 micron filter and the filtered solution of the complex recovered.<br>

sulfobutylether-7-p-cyclodextrin or 2-hydroxypropyl*P-cyclodextrin of the invention has been found to have improved water-solubility and stability over other formulations indicated above. For example, the aqueous solubility of the inhibitor (R)-7-cyano-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-l-(lH-imidazol-4-ylmethyl)-3-(phenylmethyl)-4-(2-thienylsulfonyl)-lH-l,4-benzodiazepine is surprisingly increased in the presence of sulfobutylether-7-p-cyclodextrin. The solubility of this inhibitor is increased from 
In addition, the stability of the preferred complex is surprisingly enhanced in the presence of light. The results show that under high intensity light of about 1000 foot-candles, the rate of degradation of the ras-farnesyltransferase inhibitor (compound 1) of the complex is decreased by greater than 10 fold in a solution containing 20% w/v SBE-CD.<br>
The enhanced aqueous solubility of the preferred complex as well as its stability in the presence of light makes it suitable for intravenous formulation, since it overcomes the disadvantage of other formulations with cosolvents and surfactants. The preferred complex of the invention overcomes ionic strength effects, which permits the use of buffers to control the pH and is fully dilutable because of a linear increase in solubility of<br><br>

the inhibitor as a function of SBE-CD. It also offers a choice of diluents such as electrolytes and non-electrolytes and is totally aqueous.<br>
The complex is useful for intravenous delivery of the ras-farnesyltransferase inhibitor for the treatment of cancer in a human being.<br>
The invention also provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising the complex of the ras-farnesyltransferase inhibitor of formula I with the sulfobutylether-7-P-cyclodextrin or 2-hydroxypropyl-P-cyclodextrin together with a pharmaceiiticany acceptable carrier thereof and optionally other therapeutic and prophylactic ingredients. The carriers must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formula and not deleterious to recipient thereof.<br>
The pharmaceutical formulation may be any formulation in which the complex may be administered and includes those suitable for oral, intranasal, intraoccular or parenteral including intramuscular and intravenous administration.<br>
The carrier ingredients for the pharmaceutical formulation may include, as appropriate, diluents, buffers, flavoring agents, binders, thickeners, lubricants, preservatives and the like.<br>
The preferred mode of administration of the complex of the present invention is parenteral, which includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection or infusion techniques. In addition to the treatment of warm-blooded animals such as mice, rats, dogs, cats, etc., the complex of the invention is effective in the treatment of humans with cancer.<br><br><br>
