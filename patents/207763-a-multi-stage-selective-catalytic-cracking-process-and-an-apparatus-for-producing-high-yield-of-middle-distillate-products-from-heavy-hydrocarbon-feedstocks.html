GRANTED<br>

Field<br>
This invention relates to a process and a system for the production of middle distillate products comprising hydrocarbons having carbon atoms in the range of C8 to C24 in high yield, from heavier petroleum fractions through multistage catalytic cracking of varying severity levels with solid acidic catalyst without using external hydrogen.<br>
Background<br>
Conventionally, middle distillate range products e.g. Heavy Naphtha, Kerosene, Jet fuel, Diesel oil and Light Cycle Oil (LCO) are produced in petroleum refineries by atmospheric/vacuum distillation of petroleum crude and also by the secondary processing of vacuum gas oil and residues or mixtures thereof. Most commonly practiced commercial secondary processes are Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) and Hydrocracking. Hydrocracking employs porous acidic catalysts similar to those used in catalytic cracking but associated with hydrogenation components such as metals of Groups VI and VII of the Periodic Table to produce good quality of middle distillate products in the boiling range of Cg - C24 hydrocarbons. An excess of hydrogen is supplied to the hydrocracking reactor under very high pressure (150-200 atm.) and at a relatively lower temperature (375-425°C) in fixed bed reactors with two phase flow. Due to severe hydrogenation, all hydrocarbon products from Hydrocracker are highly saturated with low sulfur and aromaticity. The yield of middle distillate hydrocarbons (126-391°C boiling range) in hydrocracking is typically very high up to 65 - 80 wt% of feed.<br>
FCC process, on the other hand, is employed for essentially producing high octane Gasoline and LPG. In countries, where demand of middle distillate product is<br><br>
higher, Heavy Cracked Naphtha (HCN: C8 - C12 hydrocarbons) and Light Cycle Oil (LCO: C13 - C24 hydrocarbons) production are maximized by manipulating operating variablesjso as to vary the reaction and regenerator severity levels U.S<br>
 patent Nos.894,931 and 3,894,933address such operations. Typically, diesel yield in FCC is maximized by maintaining a lower reaction and regeneration severity (i.e., lower regenerator and reactor top temperature) and recycling of unconverted residual products. Catalyst with lower zeolite/matrix ratio and MAT (Micro Activity Test) activity of 60-70 is normally preferred. By proper selection of FCC variables and innovations involving catalyst type and recycle of Heavy Cycle Oil and residual Slurry oil, distillate yield can be increased by considerable amount at the expense of Gasoline yield. As the FCC unit operation is shifted from gasoline mode to middle distillate maximization mode, the LCO cetane number increases and thus could be more useful for blending to diesel pool.<br>
However, while running at low severity operations, for maximizing diesel yield, the unconverted bottom yield also increases to a significant extent and sometimes may even exceed 20 wt% of fresh feed as against 5-6 wt% for usual gasoline mode operation. The other drawback of low severity operation is the high amount an recycle oil being used in the riser bottom with fresh feed for further cracking. Firstly, this reduces the throughput of riser reactor and secondly, with single riser and product fractionator, the recycle is nonselective. This results into recycling of un-crackable, aromatic components into the riser and thereby increases Coke and Gas without appreciably increasing the conversion level. Consequently, Diesel yield from FCC with the conventional cracking catalyst could be maximized upto 40-45 wt% in spite of running at low reaction severity (495°C riser temperature) and fairly higher recycle ratio (30% of fresh feed).<br>
Besides the operation of conventional FCC in middle distillate maximization mode, there are several other processes aiming for improvement in middle distillate yield.    U.S. Pat. No.5,098,554 discloses a process of fluid catalytic<br><br>
cracking with multiple feed injection points where fresh feed is charged to upper injection points and unconverted slurry oil is recycled to a location below the fresh feed nozzles. Essentially, the process conditions are similar to that of gasoline mode FCC operation (e.g., 527°C riser top temperature) which favors gasoline production. By adopting split feed injection, middle distillate yield is marginally increased at the expense of Gasoline yield.<br>
U.S.  Pat.  No.  4,481,104  describes  about an ultra-stable Y-zeolite  of high<br>
framework silica to alumina ratio having low acidity, large pores, use of which in catalytic cracking of gas oil, enhances distillate yield with production of low Coke and Dry gas. It may be noted that yield of 420 - 650°F fraction is maximize about 28 wt% of feed and as 650°F- conversion increases beyond 67 wt%, the yield of 420-650°F fraction further reduces. Therefore, as discussed earlier, yield of the distillate is relatively more only at the higher yield of unconverted fraction.<br>
Yet another process in U.S. Pat. No. 4,606,810 discloses a scheme of two riser<br>
cracking for improving total gasoline plus distillate yield. Here, the feed is first cracked in the first riser with spent catalyst from the second riser and the unconverted part is further cracked in a second riser in presence of regenerated catalyst. The basic operation is of high severity producing maximum amount of Gasoline and the yield of LFO is around 15-20 wt% of feed. It may also be noted that while increase in Gasoline yield is in the range of 7.5 - 8.0 wt%, increase in LFO yield is merely in the range of 1.5 - 3.0 wt% on fresh feed basis.<br>
Two stage processing of hydrocarbon feedstock has been employed by different researchers in the field of catalytic cracking. Several processes have been developed in which first stage processing removes metals and Conradson Carbon Residue (CCR) impurities from feed using a low activity cheap contact material with abundant surface area. The demetallized feed is then processed in a more conventional second stage reactor under high severity to maximize the conversion<br><br>
and gasoline production. U.S. Pat. No. 4,436,613 describes such a process of two stage catalytic cracking using two different types of catalyst. In the first stage, the CCR materials and metals are separated from the rest of the feedstock along with mild cracking over a relatively lower active catalyst. The residual un-cracked product of the first stage is then contacted with a high active catalyst under higher reaction severity for gasoline maximization. It may be noted that in this process, two dedicated strippers and regenerators are used to avoid the mixing of two ' different types of catalysts.<br>
Dual riser high severity catalytic cracking process described US.pat.No. 3,928,172 utilizes a mixture of large pore REY zeolite catalyst and a shape selective zeolite catalyst where gas oil is cracked in the first riser in the presence of the aforesaid catalyst mixture. The Heavy Naphtha product from the first riser and/or virgin straight run Naphtha are cracked in the second riser in the presence of catalyst mixture to produce high octane Gasoline together with C3 and C4 olefins. US. Pat. No. 4,830,728 discloses a process for upgrading straight run Naphtha, catalytically cracked Naphtha and mixtures thereof in a multiple fluid catalytic cracking operation utilizing mixture of amorphous cracking catalyst and/or large pore Y-zeolite based catalyst and shape selective ZSM-5 to produce high octane gasoline.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,401,387 describes a process of multistage catalytic cracking where the first stage cracks a first feed over a shape selective zeolite to produce lighter products rich in iso-compounds which may be used for making ethers. A second feed which may include 700°F+ liquid from first stage is cracked in the second stage. Another process as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,824,208, discloses a scheme in which hydrocarbon is initially contacted with cracking catalyst forming a first cracked product which after recovering of the product having boiling point of more than 430°F, is subjected to cracking in a second riser. The basic objective of<br><br><br>
this invention is to maximize the yield of light olefins and minimize the formation of aromatic compounds by avoiding undesirable hydrogen transfer reactions.<br>
So far, most of the prior art methods have concentrated on multiple riser catalytic cracking for maximization of gasoline yield and its octane numbers, increased<br>
yield of iso-olefin for production of ethers, increased yield of light olefins, etc. From the prior art Information and also from our experience of operating low severity FCC units, it is quite clear that maximizing middle distillate yield in FCC (without using external hydrogen) is not achieved beyond a level of 40-45 wt% of fresh feed. Further, persons involved in fluid cracking would be aware that middle distillate being an intermediate product in the complex catalytic cracking reactions, its maximization is very difficult because when the severity is increased, it is re-cracked to lighter hydrocarbons.<br>
Objects<br>
Accordingly, the main object of the present invention aims to propose a novel catalytic cracking process for producing middle distillate products in very high yield (about 50-65 wt%).<br>
Another object is to provide a multiple riser system that enables the production of middle distillate products including Heavy Naphtha and Light Cycle Oil in high yield.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a multiple riser system to produce higher yield of Heavy Naphtha and Light Cycle Oil as compared to the prior art processes employing catalytic cracking of petroleum feedstock without any use of external supply of hydrogen.<br><br>
1<br>
A further objective of the process is to minimize the yield of unwanted dry gas and coke and also the yield of unconverted bottom products, at the same time, improving the cetane quality of the middle distillate product.<br>
Summary<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a novel process for catalytic cracking of various petroleum based heavy feed stocks in the presence of solid zeolite catalyst and high pore size acidic components for selective bottom cracking and mixtures thereof, in a multiple riser type system wherein continuously circulating fluidized bed reactors are operated at different severities to produce middle distillate products in high yield, in the range of 50-65 wt% of fresh feed.<br>

Description of Fig.l :<br>
In the conventional Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) unit, fresh feed (1) is injected at the bottom of the riser (2) which comes into contact with the hot regenerated catalyst from the regenerator (3). The catalyst along with hydrocarbon product vapors ascends the riser and at the end of the riser spent catalyst is separated from the hydrocarbon vapor and subjected to steam stripping. The hydrocarbon vapors from the riser reactor is sent to a main fractionator column (4) for separating into the desired products. The stripped catalyst is passed to the regenerator (3) where<br><br>
the coke deposited on the catalyst is burnt and the clean catalyst is circulated back to the bottom of the riser.<br>
The fluidized catalytic cracking two riser system of the invention is schematically shown in Fig.2. and described in detail hereinbelow.<br>
The fluidized bed catalytic cracking system for the production of high yield of middle distillate products comprising .hydrocarbons having carbon atoms in the range of C8to C24 from heavy petroleum feeds, by a process as defined in claim 1, said system comprising at least two riser reactors (1 and 2) wherein, a fresh feed is introduced into the first riser reactor (1), typically, at the bottom section above regenerated catalyst entry zone through a feed nozzle (3), and at the end of the first riser reactor (1), the spent catalyst is quickly separated from hydrocarbon product vapors using separating devices (4) and subjected to multistage steam stripping to remove any entrained hydrocarbons, and a conduit (5) feeds a part of the said stripped catalyst into a regenerating apparatus (7) and the other part of the stripped catalyst from the conduit (5) travels through another conduit (6) into a mixing vessel (10); and thereafter, the mixed catalyst from the mixing vessel (10) travels through a conduit (19) and is fed to the bottom of the first riser reactor (1), the hydrocarbon product yapors from the first riser reactor (1) which are separated from the catalyst in the separating devices (4) are fed to a vacuum or atmospheric distillation column (13) through conduit (12) whereby the first cracked hydrocarbon products are separated into a first fraction comprising hydrocarbons having boiling points less than or equal to 370°C and a second fraction comprising uncracked hydrocarbons with boiling points greater than or equal to3700C; the said second fraction comprising uncracked hydrocarbon products is fed through feed nozzle (16) into the bottom of second riser reactor (2) above the regenerated catalyst entry zone, and the regenerated catalyst from the regenerating apparatus (7) is fed to the bottom of the second riser reactor (2) through a conduit (9), and subsequently, the hydrocarbon products of the second riser reactor (2) are<br><br>
separated from the catalyst in separating devices (11), and the cracked products of the second riser reactor (2) along with the products of the first fraction of the first riser reactor (1) comprising hydrocarbons with boiling points less than or equal to 370°C are fed to a main fractionator column (15) which separates the said products into dry gas, LPG, gasoline, heavy naphtha, light cycle oil, heavy cycle oil, and slurry oil, and the entire heavy cycle oil and full or part of the slurry oil consisting mainly of hydrocarbons with boiling points greater than or equal to 370°C are recycled back to the second riser reactor (2) through a separate feed nozzle (17) located at a point lower than the position of introduction of main feed, and the feed and cracked product vapors travel along with the catalyst, into the reactor wherein the spent catalyst separated from product vapors of the second riser reactor (2) in separating devices and the spent catalyst is subjected to multistage steam stripping for removal of entrained hydrocarbons and the stripped catalyst travels through a conduit (18) into the regenerating apparatus (7), wherein the coke on catalyst is burnt in the presence of air and/or oxygen containing gases at high temperature, and the flue gas from regeneration is separated from the entrained catalyst fines in separating devices (23) and the flue gas leaves from top of the regenerating apparatus (7) through a conduit (22) for heat recovery and venting through stack; the hot regenerated catalyst is withdrawn from the regenerating apparatus (7) and divided into two parts, one going to the mixing vessel (10) through the conduit (8) and the other directly to the bottom of the second riser reactor (2), and the mixed catalyst from the mixing vessel (10) is fed through the conduit (19) to the inlet of the first riser reactor (1), controlling the catalyst bed level in the individual or common stripper, the catalyst circulation rate from the common regenerator and the quantity of the spent and regenerated catalyst entering into the mixing vessel (10) using slide valves placed on the conduits and thereby producing high yield of middle distillate products.<br>
At the bottom 'Y' section of both the risers (1&amp;2), steam is used to lift the catalyst in upward direction upto the feed entry zone. Also steam is used in the feed<br><br>
nozzles (3,16 &amp;17) for atomization and dispersion of the feed. The quantity of the steam flow into the respective risers (1&amp;2) are varied depending on the feedstock quality and the desired velocity in the risers.<br>
As an example, the system designed to practice the process of the invention has been described employing only two riser reactors. It is pertinent to note that in practice, riser reactors of desired number may be connected to the second riser reactor so that the unconverted hydrocarbons obtained from the second riser may be further treated in accordance with the process described herein above and eventually, substantially the pure middle distillate products may be obtained in high yield from the original feed.<br>
In catalytic cracking processes using zeolite based catalyst, the reactions proceed sequentially. High boiling large feed molecules first enter the catalyst through relatively large pores which allows pre-cracking to form intermediate middle distillate range molecules which are further cracked to lighter molecules corresponding to Dry gas, LPG and Gasoline. Ideally, middle distillate yield can be increased, if it's cracking to lighter products is restricted. Any attempt in this regard is likely to reduce the conversion, resulting in higher yield of unconverted products. Conventionally, recycling of unconverted fraction has been practiced to improve the overall conversion. The severity required for cracking of the unconverted recycled fraction is adequate to produce significant quantity of gasoline and LPG by over-cracking of middle distillate range product. It also promotes hydrogen transfer reactions producing aromatics in middle distillate range products and therefore, deteriorates the cetane quality. To summarize, it may be noted that maximization of intermediate product middle distillate is more challenging as compared to maximization of gasoline.<br>
In distinction to other prior art processes, the present invention provides a process for producing maximized quantity middle distillate through catalytic cracking of<br><br>
heavy hydrocarbon fractions employing multiple risers. The applicants realized that the middle distillate selectivity is higher only at lower conversion. In fact, the ratio of yield of Total Cycle Oil (TCO:150-370°C) to the sum of other products, (such as, dry gas, LPG, gasoline and coke) increases as the conversion reduces. Moreover, riser temperature has dramatic impact on the selectivity. At same conversion, the applicants have found that middle distillate selectivity improves significantly as riser temperature is reduced.the appliclnts have also investigated the role of coke on regenerated catalysCRC) and discovered that there is an optimum CRC for maximum yield of TCO (Ref.: Ind. Chem. Res., 32, 1081, 1993). Finally, the applicants have arrived at some specific conditions (comprising of very low riser temperature, low contact time, low catalyst oil ratio, higher CRC, etc.) and type of the catalyst with which yield of TCO is maximized.<br>
According to the present invention, petroleum feed stocks such as Vacuum Gas Oil (VGO), Coker fuel oil, Coker/Visbreaker heavy gas oil, Hydrocracker bottom, etc. is catalytically cracked in presence of solid zeolite catalyst with or without selective acidic bottom cracking components in multiple riser-reactors. The feed is first preheated at a temperature in the range of 150-350°C and then injected to pneumatic flow riser type cracking reactor with residence time of 1-8 seconds and preferably of 2-5 seconds. At the exit of the riser, hydrocarbon vapors are quickly separated from catalyst for minimizing the over cracking of middle distillate to lighter products.<br>
The product from the first riser is separated in a fractionator to at least two streams, one comprising hydrocarbons having boiling below 370°C and the other comprising hydrocarbons having boiling points greater than 370°C. The removal of hydrocarbons having boiling points less than or equal to 370°C products reduces the chance of over-cracking of middle distillate range molecules to lighter products. The unconverted fraction comprising hydrocarbons having boiling points greater than or equal to 370°C fraction f the first riser is pre-heated and then<br><br>
injected to the second riser reactor with residence time of about 1-12 seconds and preferably in the range of about 4-10 seconds, through the feed nozzles located at a higher elevation. In the second riser, the regenerated catalyst is contacted with the recycle stream of unconverted heavy hydrocarbons from the second riser at a relatively lower elevation of the riser. This allows preferential cracking of the recycle components under high severity conditions (e.g., higher temperature, higher dynamic activity of the catalyst owing to low coke on regenerated catalysts) at the bottom of second riser. Typically, recycle ratio is maintained in the range of 0-50% of the feed throughput in the second riser.<br>
Steam and/or water, in the range of 1-20 wt% of feed is added for dispersion and atomization in both the risers depending on type of feedstock. The desired velocity in the risers, especially in the first riser is adjusted by addition of steam.<br>
The hydrocarbon product vapor from the second riser is quickly quenched with water/other hydrocarbon fraction and separated for minimizing the post riser non¬selective cracking. The product from the second riser and the product boiling below 370°C from the first riser are separated in a common fractionator into several products, such as Dry gas, LPG, Gasoline, Heavy naphtha, Light Cycle Oil and cracked bottom. Part of the unconverted bottom product (370°C+ fraction) from the second fractionator is recycled to the second riser and remaining part is sent to rundown after removal of catalyst fines.<br>
The spent catalyst with entrained hydrocarbons from the riser exit is then passed through a common or separate stripping section where counter current steam stripping of the catalyst is carried out to remove the hydrocarbon vapors from the spent catalyst. The catalyst residence time in the strippers is required to be kept in the lower side of preferably less than 30 seconds. This helps to minimize undue thermal cracking reactions and also reduces the possibility of over-cracking of middle distillate range products. Stripped catalyst is then passed to a common<br><br>
dense or turbulent fluidized bed regenerator where the coke on catalyst is burnt in presence of air and/or oxygen containing gases to achieve coke on regenerated catalyst (CRC) of lower than 0.4 wt% and preferably in the range of about 0.1-0.3 wt%. A part of the regenerated catalyst is directly circulated to the second riser reactor via standpipe / slide valve at a temperature of 600 - 750°C.<br>
As mentioned earlier, there is an optimum CRC at which maximum(TCO)yield is obtained. In order to extract maximum TCO from the first riser, CRC is required to be maintained at relatively higher level, in the range of 0.2- 0.8 wt% depending on catalyst and operating conditions. In the second riser, the desirable CRC is relatively lower (in the range of 0.1 - 0.3 wt%) in order to utilize the full activity potential of the catalyst. Also the temperature of the regenerated catalyst entering to the two risers are different. The lower temperature and higher CRC of the catalyst entering to the first riser is achieved by mixing a part of the stripped catalyst from the first riser / common stripper with regenerated catalyst in a separate vessel equipped with fluidization steam and circulating the mixed catalyst to the bottom of the first riser via stand pipe / slide valve. The mixed catalyst enters at the bottom of the first riser with a temperature in the range of 450 -575°C (preferably in the range 475 - 550°C) and CRC of lower than 0.8 wt% (preferably in the range of 0.25 - 0.5 wt% depending on type of catalyst). Another option of controlling the catalyst return temperature in the first riser is to employ catalyst cooler so that catalyst/oil ratio could be controlled almost independently. However, the mixing vessel is preferred since it acts as second stage stripper and helps to adjust the coke level on the catalyst.<br>
Prior to the injection of the 370°C+ fraction of the first riser product, the fresh regenerated catalyst is contacted with the recycle stream of unconverted hydrocarbons from the second riser at a relatively lower elevation of the riser. The recycle components are preferentially cracked at the high severity conditions prevailing in the second riser bottom before the injection of 370°C+ fraction of<br><br>
first riser product. Typically recycle ratio is maintained in the range of 0 - 50% of the second reactor feed throughput depending on the type of the feed to be processed and the conversion level in both the reactors. If the recycle quantity is less, it may be injected along with the main feed i.e., 370°C+ fraction of first riser product.<br>
In the present invention, the first riser operates in the range of 150 - 350 hr-1 weight hourly space velocity (WHSV), 2 - 8 catalyst to oil ratio, 400 - 500°C riser top temperature to convert the feedstock to selectively cracked product including 35 - 45 wt% min. TCO yield and 40 - 60 wt% 370°C+ (bottom) yield. The second riser operates in the range of 75 - 275 hr-1 WHSV, 4-12 catalyst to oil ratio and 425 -525°C riser top temperature. The absolute pressure in both reactors are 1 - 4 kg/cm2 (g). Steam and / or water, in the range of 1 - 20 wt% of feed is added not only for dispersion and atomization of feed but also to attain the desired fluidization velocity in the risers, especially in the first riser bottom. It also helps in avoiding the coke formation or catalyst agglomeration.<br>

Use of multiple riser concepts is not new, as each researcher has employed it for different purposes. The present invention utilizes dual or multiple riser systems for exclusive maximization of middle distillate products. Being an intermediate product, middle distillate range molecules have a tendency to undergo further cracking. There is always a trade off between maximization of an intermediate range product and minimization of bottom unconverted part. This invention includes the sequence of operation and operating conditions for control of over-cracking of middle distillate in the first riser and upgradation of heavier molecules to middle distillate in the second riser. This invention provides a novel scheme for operation of two or multiple risers at entirely different operating conditions with a common regenerator. Use of so much lower temperature cracking is unusual so far. However, the applicants have found that reaction temperature has a predominant effect on the over cracking of middle distillate range products. For example, at 40 wt% of 370°C- conversion, the wt% yield ratio of TCO and all other products, (i.e., Dry Gas, LPG, Gasoline &amp; Coke) except TCO and bottom (subsequently referred as TCO/Rest ratio) are in the range of about 3.0 - 3.5 and about 1.5 - 1.8 at reaction temperatures of 425°C and 490°C respectively. The difference in the above ratio is narrowed down as the conversion increases (Figure-3).<br>
Therefore, for maximizing TCO, low reaction temperature and catalyst to oil ratio as well as low catalyst activity is desirable. The applicants identified that lower catalyst / oil ratio (2 - 8) and higher WHSV of (150 - 350 hr-1) along with lower riser temperature in the first riser of the process of the present invention are very important to achieve very low degree of over cracking for producing maximum middle distillate range components. The applicants also observed that the TCO/Rest ratio is significantly affected by the 370°C- conversion level. For example, for a given catalyst and reaction temperature, if 370°C- conversion is 40%, the TCO/Rest ratio is as high as 3.2 which comes down to about 1.3 when<br><br><br>
37,0°C - conversion is increased to 70%. This shows that restricting the conversion in the first stage riser upto 40 - 45% is very important to maximize the yield of middle distillate.<br>
In the second riser, the operating conditions need to be different for upgradation of relatively less crackable heavy material to lighter products. However, undue increase in severity parameters will lead to conversion to LPG and Gasoline. The applicants have discovered that operation at an intermediate severity as compared to gasoline maximization mode FCC operation is absolutely necessary. The applicantshave also found that in order to reduce the yield of unconverted bottom and improve the middle distillate selectivity, recycle at a lower elevated entry point at the bottom of the second riser is very much effective. This allows the cracking of the recycled heaviest fraction in presence of regenerated catalyst at relatively higher temperature and lower CRC which improves the dynamic activity of the catalyst and offers maximum cracking of the recycled feed. After cracking of the recycled part, the catalyst temperature comes down due to utilization of part of the heat for vaporization and endothermic cracking reactions of the recycled feed. Also, the coke on catalyst increases which essentially blocks some of the active sites and thereby reduces the dynamic activity of the catalyst. The contacting of catalyst having relatively lower temperature and higher coke on catalyst with the main feed comprising the fraction of the first riser of hydrocarbons with boiling points greater than or equal to 370°C, assists to improve the selectivity of middle distillate range products out of the second riser. This contacting pattern is unique and highly effective in increasing the overall yield of the middle distillate and reducing yield of the unwanted slurry oil.<br>
In the present invention, the delta coke (defined as the difference in coke content<br>
of spent and regenerated catalyst) is low due to lower coke make in the extremely<br>
low severity cracking in the first riser which is expected to keep the regenerator<br>
temperature at relatively lower level as compared to the conventional FCC<br>
operation using similar type of feedstocks. However, overall lower catalyst oil<br>
ratio is likely to compensate this effect and thereby maintain the regenerator temperature at least to the same level as that of conventional FCC as required for burning of coke on catalyst.<br>
Further details of feedstock, catalyst, products and operating conditions of the process of the present invention are described below:<br>
Feed Stock:<br>
Feed stock for the present invention includes hydrocarbon fractions starting from carbon no. 20 to carbon no. 80.

Bottom cracking components consisting of peptized alumina, acidic silica alumina or Y- alumina or a mixture thereof are also added to the catalyst formulation to produce synergistic effect towards maximum middle distillate under the operating conditions, as outlined above. It may be noted that both the first and second stage risers are charged with same catalyst. The pore size range of the active components namely, Re-USY zeolite and bottom selective active materials are in the range of 8 - 11 and 50 -1000 angstrom respectively. The typical properties of the Y-zeolite based catalyst are given in Table-2.<br><br><br>

The product yields along with conversions are given in Table-7 wherein it is observed that as in both -216°C and -370°C conversion increases, TCO yield increases upto an optimum value and thereafter, it reduces with increase in conversion. TCO being an intermediate product, undergoes further cracking as reaction severity increases. Therefore, in order to maximize TCO yield, the over-cracking is to be restricted.<br>

Effect of reaction temperature on middle distillate yields at same conversion<br>
This example illustrates the effect of reaction temperature on the yield of middle distillate at a given -216°C conversion. The experiments were conducted in the<br><br>
modified MAT reactor with the same feed as mentioned in Example-1, at two different temperatures, viz., 425°C and 495°C. Catalyst employed here is catalyst C which is commercially available FCC catalyst of following properties as shown in the Table - 8. Table - 8<br><br>

The conversion was varied by changing W/F ratio. The product yields are compared at same -216°C conversion but at different temperatures. It is noted from Table-9 that at higher temperature, TCO yield and more importantly the TCO/Rest ratio (the ratio of TCO yield and yield of other products e.g., Dry gas, LPG, Gasoline and Coke except bottom and TCO) are much lower in case of higher reaction temperature. For example, at a given -216°C conversion, TCO yield at 425°C temperature is about 6 - 10% higher than that at 495°C. The other significant point is that at low temperature of 425°C, it has been possible to get 46% TCO yield (per pass) at 50% -216°C conversion. Similarly, there is a significant improvement in TCO/Rest ratio for 425°C as compared to that of 495°C at same conversion. This clearly demonstrates that in order to conserve middle distillate range molecules, low reaction temperature is essential.<br>
Example-3<br>
First stage riser cracking conditions<br>
This example illustrates the significance of first stage riser cracking conditions e.g., temperature, catalyst/oil ratio and conversion on the yield of middle distillate and other products while employing commercially available FCC catalysts A and C, properties of which are described in Example-1 &amp; 2 respectively. The tests were conducted in modified fixed bed MAT unit with same feed as described in Example-1. Yield data were generated at different conversion level for the catalysts as indicated above and the yields of different products were obtained. TCO/Rest ratios at different conversion levels are plotted in Figure-3, from which it is observed that for both the catalysts, the TCO/Rest ratio increases as the -370°C conversion is reduced. Therefore, it is important to note that the per pass -<br><br>
-370 C conversion in the first stage riser should be kept below 45% and preferably below 40%.<br>
From Figure-3, it is also observed that the TCO/Rest ratio is a strong function of the reactor temperature for a given conversion and catalyst. For example, with catalyst C, while reducing reaction temperature from 490 to 425°C, the TCO/Rest ratio is increased from 3.4 to 3.75 at about -370°C conversion level of 40%. This clearly shows that for the first stage cracking, the reaction temperature should be kept lower, preferably in the range of 425 - 450°C.<br>
Example - 4<br>
Catalyst characteristics for middle distillate maximization<br>
One of the important observation as illustrated in Example-3, is that for maximization of middle distillate yield, it is necessary to restrict the per-pass conversion within 40 - 45% and operate the first stage riser at lower reaction temperature. The low reaction temperature coupled with high coke on regenerated catalyst leads to lower dynamic activity of the catalyst. Therefore, the desired catalyst should have high intrinsic activity. However, the problem is that high active catalysts are not usually diesel selective. In this example, we illustrate the importance of catalyst characteristics to obtain higher yield of middle distillate out of the dual / multi - stage risers.<br>
MAT activity is measured in ASTM MAT unit using a standard feedstock and defined as the wt% of products boiling below 216°C including coke at ASTM conditions. All other experiments were conducted at the temperature of 425°C in the modified MAT reactor with the same feed as described in Example-1 and different catalysts. The important properties of the catalysts and the yield / conversion data are compared in Table-10.<br><br>
