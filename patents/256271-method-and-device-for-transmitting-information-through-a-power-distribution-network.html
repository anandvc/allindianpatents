The present invention relates to a method and a device for<br>
transmitting a piece of information through, an electricity<br>
distribution network.<br>
The electric line has been used for many years as a<br>
low-rate data transmission means, particularly in home<br>
automation applications, to remotely control electric<br>
appliances (such as electric shutters for example). The<br>
known data transmission methods involve injecting, into the<br>
network, a carrier signal which is modulated appropriately<br>
to carry, data. The disadvantage of these methods is that<br>
they require the injection of such a carrier signal. They<br>
are therefore intrusive and cause interference, and are<br>
complex to implement.<br>
The present invention aims to provide a method for<br>
transmitting a piece of information via an electricity distribution<br>
network which is less intrusive and causes less interference than<br>
the known methods. The intended applications are mainly the<br>
transmission of binary data but also the transmission of a non-<br>
binary piece of information, for example a series of pulses having a<br>
predetermined profile enabling an electric appliance to be<br>
identified without requiring the information to be rebuilt in binary<br>
form.<br>
As set forth in the patent EP 1 136 829, any electric<br>
appliance or element, particularly motors, pumps, transformers,<br>
electric bulbs, electric or electronic circuits, generates, when<br>
switched on and switched off, a high frequency spurious signal<br>
having an electromagnetic origin. As this signal is very short in<br>
duration, it forms a high frequency spurious pulse naturally emitted<br>
by the electric element. Such a spurious pulse forms a sort of<br>
unique signature that is representative of the electric appliance<br>
and of its location on the electricity distribution network. Thus,<br>
the patent EP 1 136 829 suggests detecting and analyzing the high<br><br>
frequency pulses emitted an the network by electric appliances, so<br>
as to identify the appliances that are switched on or switched off.<br>
The aforementioned patent also suggests providing a pulse<br>
synthesizer capable of supplying a pulse that replaces the spurious<br>
pulse naturally emitted when the amplitude of the latter is too low<br>
to be validly detected. The use of a pulse synthesizer is also<br>
considered to emit a series of pulses comprising a determined number<br>
of pulses forming a unique signature.<br>
Classically, a pulse synthesizer capable of emitting a series<br>
of pulses comprises for example a HF pulse generator switch, a HF<br>
oscillator, a logic circuit and an output transformer. The HF<br>
oscillator supplies a high frequency signal for switching the HF<br>
switch. The logic circuit supplies a coded signal that is<br>
mixed with the switching signal to obtain a signal for<br>
controlling the switch. The output transformer enables the<br>
series of HF pulses artificially reconstituted to be re-<br>
injected into the electricity distribution network.<br>
However, the cost price and overall dimension of such<br>
a pulse synthesizer are substantial in the context of the<br>
intended applications, which concern mass markets and<br>
demand very low cost prices.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides for transmitting a piece<br>
of information on an electricity distribution network without using<br>
any pulse synthesizer.<br>
More particularly, the present invention provides for<br>
transmitting a piece of information by using the high frequency<br>
spurious pulses naturally emitted by an electric element when the<br>
latter is connected or disconnected from the network. For this<br>
purpose, the electric element is linked to the network by a switch<br>
and the switch is driven by a control signal representative of the<br>
information to be transmitted. Thus, the high frequency spurious<br><br>
pulses emitted by the electric element mirror the control signal<br>
that itself mirrors the information to be transmitted. The duration<br>
of such pulses, of electromagnetic origin, is very short and is<br>
independent of the time elapsing between the closing and opening of<br>
the switch, which can be much longer.<br><br>
In prior art, various data transmission methods have already<br>
been proposed based on the emission of pulses in an electricity<br>
distribution network. These are generally voltage or current pulses<br>
generated by the discharge of a capacitor, the duration of the<br>
discharge forming the duration of the pulse. These voltage or<br>
current pulses are directly injected into the network by means of a<br>
switch or are injected by inductive coupling. To be detected, they<br>
require considerable electrical energy to be injected into the<br>
network.<br>
With the present invention, the electrical energy that must be<br>
applied to the network can, on the contrary, be very low or even<br>
almost zero (within the limit of the laws of physics and inductive<br>
phenomena) as it is not an energy-carrier voltage or current pulse<br>
that is detected, but a high frequency spurious pulse that goes with<br>
the connection or the disconnection of the electric element.<br>
In prior art, high frequency spurious pulses are perhaps<br>
unintentionally emitted simultaneously with the emission of voltage<br>
or current pulses, but such spurious pulses emitted unintentionally<br>
are not used as a means for transmitting information and are not<br>
therefore detected as such.<br>
Thus, the document GB 1 153 908 describes a data transmission<br>
method consisting in discharging a capacitor 4 in the electric<br>
network (Cf. page 2 lines 55-121, Figures 1 to 3) and in detecting<br>
the discharge pulses which are superimposed on the alternating<br>
voltage of the network.<br>
The document US 4 090 184 also describes a data transmission<br>
method by discharging a capacitor (Cf. column 17 lines 22-34) and<br>
detecting the discharge pulses.<br>
The document US 5 614 8 11 also describes a data transmission<br>
method by discharging a capacitor (Cf. claim 1, last line).<br>
Moreover, this method interferes with the electric network since the<br>
capacitor is discharged at moments when the alternating voltage<br>
crosses zero (Cf. Fig. 7, column 3 line 61 to column 4 line 16).<br>
The document GB 2__P08 299 also describes a data transmission<br>
method by discharging a capacitor 20 (Cf. claim 1, last line, Figure<br>
1) . Also in this method, the capacitor can be discharged at moments<br><br>
when the wave of the alternating voltage crosses 0 (Cf. Fig. 18,<br>
"signal pulses at zero crossing") .<br>
The document US 5 486 805 also describes a method comprising<br>
the emission of pulses by discharging a capacitor when the<br>
alternating voltage crosses zero (Cf. Figure 1).<br>
The document US 2003/0156014 describes a method for<br>
transmitting data an an electric network using a plurality of sub-<br>
carrier frequencies (Cf. paragraph Oil) that are injected into the<br>
network by means of a coupling circuit (Cf. 121, Fig. 3).<br>
The document US 2002/0024423 describes a method of injecting<br>
coded data on an electric network by means of a pseudo-noised code<br>
which is modulated by means of a train of electrical energy pulses<br>
without using any sinusoidal carrier. Like the previous ones, this<br>
method is based on injecting energy into the electric network and<br>
not on the use of natural spurious pulses.<br>
The document US 3 714 451 also describes the injection of<br>
energy pulses into an electric network, by discharging a capacitor<br>
(Cf. 25a Figure 2, Figures 4, 5, 7, claim 1).<br>
The document wo 00 /26679 describes a method for detecting the<br>
closing of a switch in which current peaks are injected into a<br>
branch of a network (Cf. Figure 4) controlled by the switch. The<br>
current is injected by a circuit (Cf. Figures 1A or 1B) which<br>
cyclically discharges a capacitor (Cf. 170 or 260) . The current<br>
pulses are short in duration so as to limit the appearance, in<br>
neighboring network branches, of induced current peaks. Therefore,<br>
the induced current peaks are of low amplitude and do not interfere<br>
with the detection of the main current peak. The main current peak<br>
is detected by a detector (Cf. Fig. 2) which comprises a coil (L1)<br>
enabling the current peak to be detected by induction. An amplifier<br>
coupled to the coil electrically supplies an audible alarm (351)<br>
which emits an audible signal when the user approaches the branch in<br>
which the current peaks are injected.<br>
Finally, the document US 4 982 175 describes a telemetry<br>
system that injects pulses on an electric network (Cf. 32, Figure 3)<br>
caused by the discharge of a capacitor (Cf. 26, Figure 2). These<br>
pulses are not high frequency spurious pulses within the meaning of<br><br>
the present invention and are detected by induction by means of<br>
coils (Cf. 41a to 42b, Figure 6) .<br>

given in relation with, but not limited to the accompanying<br>

embodiment of a pulse-emitting device according to the<br>
present invention, and<br>
-	Figure 7 represents in block form a circuit-breaker<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
Figure 1 represents the appearance of a spurious<br>
pulse I emitted naturally by an electric element when it is<br>
switched on. Such a spurious pulse is independent of the<br>
electricity consumption of the electric element and takes<br>
the shape of a high frequency alternating wave train,<br>
typically of a frequency in the order of 20 MHz. The<br>
duration of this spurious pulse is of several hundreds of<br>
nanoseconds, typically 250 nanoseconds. Its amplitude U<br>
can range from about ten millivolts to several Volts (under<br>
a voltage of 220 Volts) according to the reactive component<br>
of the element and the power it absorbs. Upon receipt, due<br>
to the limitations of the bandwidth of the measuring<br>
channels (measurement equipment and distribution network),<br>
the pulses collected are broader and in the order of about<br><br>
ten microseconds, i.e. a broadening by a factor 40 of the<br>
initial pulse.<br>
As indicated above, the present invention proposes<br>
controlling by an electric element, the emission of high<br>
frequency spurious pulses, to obtain a series of pulses<br>
having a sought profile, instead of artificially<br>
reproducing such pulses.<br>
Figure 2 shows the method according to the present<br>
invention. An electric element 1 is linked through a<br>
switch 2 to an electricity distribution network 3 carrying<br>
an alternating voltage Uac. The network 3 is here single<br>
phase and the electric element 1 is linked to the phase<br>
wire (PH) and to the neutral wire (NL) of the network, the<br>
switch 2 being interposed between the phase wire and the<br>
corresponding terminal of the electric element. The switch<br>
2 comprises a control terminal to which a control signal CS<br>
is applied that controls the closing and the opening of the<br>
switch.<br>
The switch 2 is of any appropriate type, for example<br>
a monostable switch of normally open type (MOS or bipolar<br>
transistor, monostable relay...) or a bistable switch<br>
(triac, bistable relay...).<br>
The element 1 can be any type of electric element<br>
producing spurious pulses of desired form (duration,<br>
amplitude...), such as an electric bulb, a light-emitting<br>
diode (LED), a capacitor, a high value resistance or a<br>
combination of these elements for example. The electric<br>
element preferably has a high impedance to avoid the<br>
appearance of a high switching current on the network. The<br>
electric element is for example a 250V capacitor of low<br>
value (C) having a high impedance Z (Z=l/2ηFC) at the<br>
frequency (F) of the voltage Uac, generally 50 or 60 Hz.<br>
The control signal CS is a signal with two states "1"<br>
and "0", the "1" corresponding to a determined control<br>
voltage and the "0" corresponding to another determined<br>
control voltage, that can be the ground potential.<br>
Conventionally, it is considered that the switch is closed<br><br>
(on) when the signal CS is on 1 (monostable switch) or when<br>
the signal CS changes from 0 to 1 (bistable switch) and<br>
that the switch is open (off) when the signal CS is on 0 or<br>
changes from 1 to 0. As will be seen below, the signal CS<br>
is capable of being applied directly to the control<br>
terminal of the switch or through a driver stage. Thus,<br>
within the meaning of the present invention, the signal CS<br>
represents the logic control signal of the switch. It can<br>
constitute the primary control signal of the switch, i.e.<br>
the signal that is effectively applied to the control<br>
terminal of the switch, if it is compatible with the<br>
electrical characteristics of this control terminal.<br>
In summary, the method according to the present<br>
invention is based on the emission of high frequency pulses<br>
designated here and in the claims as being "spurious"<br>
pulses, to distinguish them from pulses produced<br>
artificially. However, the term "spurious" does not mean<br>
that the method according to the present invention produces<br>
interference and is therefore incompatible with the<br>
legislation aiming to regulate pollution on electric<br>
networks. On the contrary, due to the very short duration<br>
of the spurious pulses, the method according to the present<br>
invention is less "intrusive" and less interfering than<br>
classical methods based on the injection of a carrier<br>
signal into the electric network or the injection of capacitor<br>
discharge pulses.<br>
Figures 3A, 3B, 3C show the method according to the<br>
present invention in greater detail. Figure 3A represents<br>
an example of any shape of signal CS and Figure 3B<br>
represents the amplitude, in Volts, of the high frequency<br>
spurious pulses produced on the network 3. Figure 3C<br>
represents the waveform of the voltage Uac at the moment at<br>
which the spurious pulses are emitted. Upon each change<br>
from the state 0 to the state 1 of the signal CS, the<br>
switch 2 becomes on, the electric element 1 receives the<br>
voltage Uac and a closing spurious pulse I1, I3, I5 (or<br>
connection pulse) is emitted. Upon each change from the<br><br>
state 1 to the state 0 of the signal CS, the switch 2<br>
changes into the open state (OFF) , the element 1 is<br>
disconnected from the network and an opening spurious pulse<br>
12, 14, 16 (or disconnection pulse) is emitted.<br>
By jointly observing Figures 3B and 3C, it can be<br>
seen that the amplitude of the spurious pulses is not<br>
constant and depends, in particular, on the moments at<br>
which these pulses are emitted. More particularly, the<br>
following experimental observations have been made:<br>
- Observation No. 1: the amplitude of the closing or<br>
opening spurious pulses depends on the amplitude of the<br>
voltage Uac at the moment at which the closing or the<br>
opening of the switch occurs,<br>
Observation No. 2: in similar emission conditions,<br>
certain spurious pulses, here the (disconnection) opening<br>
spurious pulses, can have an amplitude below that of the<br>
closing spurious pulses and not exceeding 10% of the<br>
amplitude of the closing spurious pulses.<br>
Thus, in accordance with Observation No. 1, it can be<br>
seen in Figure 3B that the closing spurious pulse I1 is<br>
maximal since it is emitted at an instant t1 at which the<br>
voltage Uac is equal to its peak value Umax (a spurious<br>
pulse of same amplitude would be obtained with the peak<br>
value -Umax). Furthermore, the closing spurious pulses I3,<br>
I5 are emitted at instants t3, t5 at which the voltage Uac<br>
has a low amplitude, and have an amplitude much lower than<br>
that of the pulse I1. Similarly, the opening spurious<br>
pulse 14 is emitted at an instant t4 at which the voltage<br>
Uac is below its peak value Umax or -Umax, and has an<br>
amplitude below that of the opening spurious pulse I2. In<br>
accordance with Observation No. 2, it can be seen that the<br>
opening spurious pulse I2, although emitted at an instant<br>
t2 at which the voltage Uac is maximal (i.e. in the same<br>
conditions) , has an amplitude clearly below that of the<br>
spurious pulse I1. Finally, the opening spurious pulse I6<br>
is emitted at an instant t6 at which the voltage Uac is<br>
maximal (-Umax) and has an amplitude higher than those of<br><br>
the closing spurious pulses I3, I5 that are emitted in<br>
unfavorable conditions, despite the fact that they would<br>
have a higher amplitude if they were emitted in the same<br>
conditions.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention based on these<br>
observations, the following rules are applied:<br>
1)	The opening spurious pulses are not considered<br>
here to be "exploitable", as they have an amplitude that is<br>
too low relative to the closing spurious pulses. Thus,<br>
these pulses are neutralized upon emission, or rejected<br>
upon receipt in a manner described below.<br>
2)	The closing spurious pulses are emitted when the<br>
voltage Uac is close to the maximum value, i.e. when the<br>
voltage Uac has an amplitude higher than or equal to x% of<br>
the value Umax, x being a parameter to be defined<br>
experimentally and preferably at least equal to 50.<br>
Figures 3D, 3E show a first embodiment of the method<br>
wherein the opening spurious pulses are neutralized upon<br>
emission. Figure 3D represents the shape of the signal CS<br>
and Figure 3E represents the amplitude of the pulses<br>
obtained. The signal CS is synchronized with the waveform<br>
of the voltage Uac, represented in Figure 3C. More<br>
particularly, the signal CS changes to 1 when the voltage<br>
Uac is equal to Umax or -Umax and changes to 0 when the<br>
voltage Uac is zero. In other terms, the switch 2 changes<br>
from the closed state to the open state when the voltage<br>
Uac is zero and the opening spurious pulses are never<br>
emitted, as can be seen in Figure 3E. However, the<br>
amplitude of the closing spurious pulses is maximal since<br>
the switch is only closed at the instants at which the<br>
voltage Uac is maximal.<br>
It will be understood that the profile of signal CS<br>
represented in Figure 3D only constitutes a template<br>
determining the authorized instants of closing and opening<br>
of the switch 2. Thus, various series of pulses each<br>
having their own profile can be emitted, and each profile<br>
can be allocated to the identification of a determined<br><br>
electric appliance, as was considered by EP 1,136,829 but<br>
by using synthesis pulses.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention,<br>
this template is used to transmit data. For example, as<br>
shown in Figure 2, data DTx to be sent, possibly in coded<br>
form, are applied to a circuit 4 that supplies the control<br>
signal CS while monitoring the voltage Uac. The data can<br>
be sent bit by bit or as a frame comprising for example one<br>
start bit and 8 data bits, and possibly a signature field,<br>
for example a parity bit. In the absence of coding, a<br>
closing of the switch 2 (i.e. the emission of a spurious<br>
pulse) corresponds to sending a bit on 1, while the absence<br>
of closing of the switch at the moment imposed by the<br>
template, i.e. an absence of any spurious pulse,<br>
corresponds to sending a bit on 0.<br>
In a network 50Hz, the period T of the voltage Uac is<br>
of 20 ms, such that 100 spurious pulses (i.e. 100 non-coded<br>
bits) can be sent in one second. Although this pulse rate<br>
is slow, it is sufficient for certain identification or<br>
data transmission applications, particularly an application<br>
to the management of a stock of streetlights described<br>
below.<br>
A second embodiment of the method is provided for<br>
sending data or trains of pulses with a higher rate. This<br>
embodiment is shown by Figures 4A, 4B, 4C. Here, the<br>
closing spurious pulses are not neutralized upon emission<br>
and are ignored upon receipt, thanks to an adequate setting<br>
of a detection threshold. To determine the instants for<br>
authorizing the emission of the spurious pulses, a<br>
threshold U1 close to the peak value Umax is chosen, for<br>
example a threshold equal to 0.66 Umax. As represented in<br>
Figure 4A, this threshold enables two time windows for<br>
authorizing emission TW1, TW2 to be defined, at each half-<br>
period T/2 of the voltage Uac. The window TW1 encompasses<br>
the values of the voltage Uac that are positive and higher<br>
than U1 and the window TW2 encompasses the values of the<br>
voltage Uac that are negative and lower than -U1 (i.e.<br><br>
higher than U1 in absolute value). Figure 4B represents<br>
the template of the control signal CS. The latter<br>
comprises trains of closing/opening pulses that are applied<br>
to the switch 2 inside each time window TW1, TW2. As can<br>
be seen in Figure 4C, each closing/opening pulse causes the<br>
emission on the network of two high frequency spurious<br>
pulses, i.e. a closing spurious pulse upon the rising edge<br>
of the closing/opening pulse and an opening spurious pulse<br>
upon the falling edge of the closing/opening pulse. As<br>
indicated above, the opening spurious pulses are of an<br>
amplitude much lower than that of the closing spurious<br>
pulses and are destined to be filtered upon receipt.<br>
With a voltage Uac of frequency 50 Hz, the duration<br>
of the windows TW1, TW2 is in the order of 6 to 7 ms and<br>
the number of closing/opening pulses that can be sent is<br>
high. Thus, if each closing/opening pulse causes the<br>
emission of two high frequency spurious pulses of a<br>
duration in the order of 10 microseconds each (pulse width<br>
upon receipt, useful signal), the minimum duration of each<br>
closing/opening pulse must be at least equal to twice the<br>
duration of the spurious pulses, i.e. in the order of 10 to<br>
20 microseconds. In these conditions, by choosing this<br>
minimum pulse duration as a template, and without taking<br>
into account any limitations of the switch in terms of<br>
switching frequency, each time window can contain<br>
approximately 300 closing/opening pulses and thus offers a<br>
high data rate relative to the first embodiment of the<br>
method of the present invention, in the order of 30,000<br>
pulses per second.<br>
As above, the data can be sent in raw form, one bit<br>
then corresponding to one pulse, or coded by any<br>
appropriate coding protocol, one bit then corresponding to<br>
several pulses. The data, whether coded or not, can be<br>
sent in the form of individual bits or as a frame<br>
comprising a start of frame field, a data field, and<br>
possibly an end of frame field that can comprise a<br>
verification field of CRC or parity type.<br><br>
It will be understood by those skilled in the art<br>
that various alternative embodiments and applications of<br>
this method are possible. For example, the emission of the<br>
high frequency spurious pulses can be provided only once<br>
per period instead of twice per period, for example when<br>
the voltage Uac is equal to +Umax (first embodiment) or is<br>
higher than +U1 (second embodiment).<br>
Figure 2 also schematically represents two examples<br>
of embodiment of pulse detectors 10, 15 according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
The detector 10 is an inductive reception device the<br>
operating principle of which has already been described in<br>
EP 1,136,829. It comprises an input transformer for<br>
extracting from the voltage Uac a mirroring signal that is<br>
analyzed to detect the high frequency spurious pulses. The<br>
transformer can be simply formed by a coil 11 arranged<br>
around the phase wire (PH) of the network, at a source<br>
point of the distribution of the current, for example near<br>
an electricity meter. The coil supplies the mirroring<br>
signal that is applied to a high-pass filter 12 to remove<br>
its low frequency alternating component. The output of the<br>
filter is applied to a sample hold analog-to-digital<br>
converter 13 ("sample hold AD converter") that supplies<br>
digital samples of the filtered voltage Uac, in<br>
synchronization with a sampling period defining an<br>
observation window. The choice of the sampling period and<br>
of the duration of the observation window depends on the<br>
period of emission of the high frequency spurious pulses,<br>
i.e. the period between two closing/opening pulses. If the<br>
spurious pulses are emitted with a high frequency, in<br>
accordance with the second embodiment of the method of the<br>
present invention, the observation window is chosen to be<br>
sufficiently short to obtain a fineness of analysis<br>
enabling the pulses to be differentiated within the pulse<br>
trains emitted. The analysis of the samples of the voltage<br>
Uac is performed by an analysis circuit 14, generally a<br>
specific logic circuit, which analyzes the amplitude of the<br><br>
samples received and detects the pulses of an amplitude<br>
above the threshold for rejecting the closing spurious<br>
pulses, so as to keep only the opening spurious pulses.<br>
The circuit 14 thus reconstitutes the control signal CS,<br>
and also deduces therefrom the data DTx when the signal CS<br>
is data bearing. If they are received in coded form, the<br>
data DTx can also be decoded by the circuit 14.<br>
The detector 15 is a contactless device comprising an<br>
antenna 16, an antenna booster 17 and a high-pass filter 18<br>
for removing the signals of frequency below that of the<br>
pulses to be detected. In addition to these elements, as<br>
above, a sample hold AD converter 13 and an analysis<br>
circuit 14 are provided. This embodiment of a pulse<br>
detector according to the present invention is based on the<br>
fact that the high frequency spurious pulses are found both<br>
as electric pulses on the network and as electromagnetic<br>
pulses that can be detected in the same way as any radio<br>
frequency signal. The detector 15 is preferably arranged<br>
near the pulse-emitting equipment, such as in the premises<br>
in which the equipment is installed for example.<br>
Figure 5 represents one simple and inexpensive<br>
embodiment of a pulse-emitting device 20 according to the<br>
present invention, intended to be installed in appliances<br>
or electric equipment.<br>
The device 20 comprises two terminals T1, T2 for<br>
connection to the electricity distribution network 3, a<br>
switch circuit 30, an electric supply circuit 40, a circuit<br>
50 for monitoring the alternating voltage Uac and a control<br>
circuit 60. The terminal Tl is connected to the phase wire<br>
(PH) and the terminal T2 connected to the neutral wire (NL)<br>
of the network 3. In accordance with the method of the<br>
present invention, the switch circuit 30 comprises an<br>
electric element 31, here a capacitor, and a switch 32.<br>
The switch 32 is for example a triac or a MOS transistor (a<br>
triac being represented in Figure 5). The switch 32 has<br>
one terminal connected to the terminal Tl, another terminal<br>
connected to one terminal of the capacitor 31, and a<br><br>
control terminal (trigger of the triac or gate of the MOS<br>
transistor) driven by the control circuit 60. The other<br>
terminal of the capacitor 31 is connected to the terminal<br>
T2.<br>
The supply circuit 40 comprises a diode bridge<br>
rectifier 41 having two input terminals connected to the<br>
terminals I1, I2 through resistances 42, 43, a terminal<br>
linked to the ground and an output terminal supplying a<br>
full-wave rectified voltage Ur. The voltage Ur is applied<br>
to one input of an adjusting assembly 46 that is linked to<br>
the ground through an overvoltage clipper diode 44 and a<br>
smoothing capacitor 45. The output of the adjusting<br>
assembly 46 is linked to a stabilization capacitor 47 and<br>
supplies a voltage Vcc for supplying the circuits 50, 60.<br>
The monitoring circuit 50 comprises a diode rectifier<br>
bridge 51 having two input terminals connected to the<br>
terminals I1, I2 through resistances 52, 53, respectively,<br>
a terminal linked to the ground and an output terminal<br>
supplying a full-wave rectified voltage Ur'. The rectified<br>
voltage Ur1 is applied to the positive input of a<br>
differential amplifier 56 that is linked to the ground<br>
through an overvoltage clipper diode 54 and a load resistor<br>
55. The negative input of the amplifier 56 receives a<br>
reference voltage Vref supplied by the mid-point of a<br>
potentiometer 57 the anode of which receives the voltage<br>
Vcc and the cathode of which is grounded. The differential<br>
amplifier 56, here operating as a comparator, supplies a<br>
signal ENB ("Enable") that is on 1 (Vcc) when the full-wave<br>
rectified voltage Ur1 is higher than the reference voltage<br>
Vref, and is on 0 (ground) in the opposite case. The<br>
potentiometer 57 enables the voltage Vref to be adjusted so<br>
as to define the width of the emission-authorizing time<br>
windows TW1, TW2. By increasing the voltage Vref, the<br>
width of the windows decreases and two authorization<br>
instants are finally obtained corresponding to Uac=Umax and<br>
Uac=-Umax, corresponding to the implementation of the first<br>
embodiment of the method according to the present invention<br><br>
(i.e. one pulse per half-period of the voltage Uac) . It<br>
will be noted that the monitoring circuit 50 may comprise<br>
only a single-wave rectifier if pulses are only to be<br>
emitted on one of the two half-periods of the voltage Uac.<br>
The circuit 60 supplies the control signal CS applied<br>
to the control terminal of the switch 32. The circuit 60<br>
comprises an inexpensive microcontroller 61, incorporating<br>
on the same silicon microchip a microprocessor and its<br>
input/output ports P0, P1, P2, P3. . ., a program memory,<br>
data memories, a quartz oscillator... The port P0 receives<br>
the signal ENB, the port P1 supplies the control signal CS,<br>
and the ports P2 P3 are, optionally, used as ports for<br>
communicating with the microcontroller for test,<br>
maintenance, programming or other operations and are linked<br>
to auxiliary terminals ATI, AT2 of the device 20.<br>
The microcontroller detects the change to 1 of the<br>
signal ENB by polling the port P0 or by interruption<br>
declared on this port. The port P1 drives the switch 32<br>
through a driver stage comprising a control block 62 and a<br>
transistor 63. The control block 62 has an output<br>
connected to the control terminal of the switch 32 and an<br>
input connected to the collector of the transistor 63, the<br>
emitter of which is connected to the ground and the base of<br>
which receives the control signal CS.<br>
Once on-board an appliance, the device 20 can be used<br>
to transmit data or, more simply, to emit a series of non<br>
data-bearing pulses, having an invariable predetermined<br>
profile, used for example to identify the electric<br>
appliance. In this last case, the circuit 60 can be a<br>
logic circuit with a basic architecture, comprising a<br>
synchronization input receiving the signal ENB and<br>
supplying the control signal CS. By providing a<br>
microcontroller or microprocessor, it is possible to<br>
implement more complex applications requiring processing<br>
and transmitting data, as will be seen in the examples of<br>
applications described below.<br><br>
Thus, various applications of the device 20 are<br>
possible. One example of an application is the control of<br>
streetlights in a built-up area. To that end, each<br>
streetlight is equipped with such a device and cyclically<br>
sends a piece of information about its on or off state.<br>
This piece of information can be sent at low rate in<br>
accordance with the first embodiment of the method of the<br>
present invention, since it is in no way urgent and can be<br>
processed over periods of time of several minutes. With a<br>
reasonable investment, hundreds of streetlights can be<br>
equipped with devices according to the present invention.<br>
By giving each streetlight one second every minute to emit<br>
pulses representative of the state of the streetlight, 60<br>
streetlights can send information in one minute. A<br>
reception unit arranged at a source point of the urban<br>
electricity distribution network or at a bypass node, is<br>
sufficient to receive the information sent by a plurality<br>
of streetlights.<br>
Various alternative embodiments of the pulse-emitting<br>
device according to the present invention can, furthermore,<br>
be made according to the intended applications.<br>
Figure 6 represents a device 20' that comprises, in<br>
addition to the circuits 30, 40, 50 and 60 that have just<br>
been described, a current sensor 70 linked to a measuring<br>
circuit 71. The measuring circuit 71 sends the control<br>
circuit 60 data relating to current measurements taken by<br>
means of the sensor 70. The microcontroller of the device<br>
60 analyzes the results of the measurements and decides<br>
whether or not to send them according to what is provided<br>
in the application program loaded into its program memory.<br>
This program can for example provide for the<br>
microcontroller to send a piece of information on the<br>
network relating to the current measured solely when the<br>
latter changes from 0 to a non-zero value, then changes<br>
from one consumption bracket to another, for example from<br>
the bracket ranging from 0 to 1 A to the bracket ranging<br>
from 1 to 2 A, from the bracket ranging from 1 to 2 A to<br><br>
the bracket ranging from 2 to 3 A, etc. This piece of<br>
information can take the shape of an eight-bit word (byte)<br>
having a first value when the current measured changes from<br>
0 to a non-zero value, then a second value when the current<br>
changes from the bracket 0-1 A to the bracket 1-2 A, etc.<br>
The device 20' can be arranged in an electric plug,<br>
particularly a piggyback plug used to electrically supply<br>
one or more appliances, or be installed on-board an<br>
electric appliance, so as to measure the current passing<br>
through the electric plug or the current consumed by the<br>
appliance in which it is installed. Such an application<br>
enables the method of measuring the electricity consumption<br>
of electric appliances described by EP 1,136,829 to be<br>
perfected. Indeed, when the current changes from 0 to a<br>
non-zero value, the emission of the first byte enables the<br>
appliance or the group of appliances that is switched on to<br>
be identified on the network. Then, the emission of bytes<br>
in relation with the change in consumption bracket enables<br>
the consumption and locating measurements taken on the<br>
network in the manner proposed by EP 1,136,829 to be<br>
confirmed.<br>
Another example of application of the method and<br>
device according to the present invention will now be<br>
described.<br>
Many industrial installations comprise circuit-<br>
breakers grouped together in electric cabinets, the closed<br>
(switched on) or open (tripped) state of which must be<br>
monitored. To that end, in the current state of the<br>
technique, circuit-breakers have been developed that are<br>
equipped with a switch with pilot light which, through a<br>
mechanical actuator, switches from the open state to the<br>
closed state when the circuit-breakers trip. Thus, in such<br>
installations, the many circuit-breakers arranged in<br>
electric cabinets each have a switch with pilot light<br>
linked by two wires to a centralizer, which monitors the<br>
state of the circuit-breakers to detect power failures.<br><br>
The present invention proposes removing the<br>
quantities of electric wires linking the switches with<br>
pilot light to the centralizer, by installing on-board a<br>
circuit-breaker a device according to the present invention<br>
that is arranged to monitor the state of the circuit-<br>
breaker and to send a piece of information when the<br>
circuit-breaker is in the open state. This piece of<br>
information can for example consist in a code for<br>
identifying the circuit-breaker, the simple emission of<br>
which means that the circuit-breaker has tripped.<br>
Figure 7 represents an example of embodiment of a<br>
circuit-breaker 90 according to the present invention,<br>
comprising a combination of a classical circuit-breaker 80<br>
and a device 20 according to the present invention. The<br>
structure of the device 20 is identical to the one<br>
described in relation with Figure 5 and will not be<br>
described again. The circuit-breaker 80 comprises input<br>
terminals T3, T4 connected to the phase and neutral wires<br>
of the upstream part of the electricity distribution<br>
network, and output terminals T5, T6 connected to the phase<br>
and neutral wires of the downstream part of the electricity<br>
distribution network. The circuit-breaker 80 also<br>
comprises control terminals T7, T8 linked to the terminals<br>
of a switch with pilot light 81. The terminals T1 and T2<br>
of the device 20 are connected to the terminals T3 and T4<br>
of the circuit-breaker 80 such that the device 20 is<br>
electrically powered when the circuit-breaker is in the<br>
open state.<br>
The detection by the device 20 of the state of the<br>
circuit-breaker 80, is here performed by means of the<br>
switch with pilot light. Such a detection can be performed<br>
in various ways. For example, the microcontroller of the<br>
control circuit 60 can comprise two input/output ports<br>
connected to the terminals T7, T8 to cyclically monitor the<br>
on or off state of the switch with pilot light. However,<br>
this solution has the disadvantage that the device 20 must<br><br>
permanently be switched on, and implies consuming<br>
electricity.<br>
One advantageous solution, represented in Figure 7,<br>
is that the supply voltage Vcc supplied by the circuit 40<br>
is applied to the monitoring circuit 50 and to the control<br>
circuit 60 through the switch with pilot light 81. Thus,<br>
the device 20 stays switched off while the circuit-breaker<br>
is in the triggered state. When the switch with pilot<br>
light 81 closes, the circuits 50, 60 are electrically<br>
powered and the control circuit 60 implicitly "knows", when<br>
it is switched on, that a piece of information must be sent<br>
on the electric network. The control circuit 60 is<br>
therefore simply programmed for emitting, when it is<br>
switched on, a series of pulses enabling the circuit-<br>
breaker to be identified. Generally speaking, the<br>
integration of the device 20 into a circuit-breaker 80 to<br>
obtain the circuit-breaker 90 according to the present<br>
invention involves only a minor increase in the cost price<br>
of the circuit-breaker, and enables, in return, substantial<br>
savings to be made on wiring as a result of removing the<br>
electric wires linking the centralizer and the circuit-<br>
breakers. A pulse receiver of the type described above<br>
enables a wireless centralizer to be produced that is<br>
capable of managing hundreds of circuit-breakers and of<br>
supplying in real time an indication about the circuit-<br>
breakers that are in the tripped state.<br>
In the light of the examples described, it will be<br>
understood by those skilled in the art that various other<br>
alternative embodiments and applications of the present<br>
invention are possible. In particular, although various<br>
applications of the method of the present invention to an<br>
electricity network carrying an alternating voltage have<br>
been described, the present invention is also applicable to<br>
direct current networks, particularly the 400V DC networks<br>
used in industry or on board ships, the 200V DC networks,<br>
including the low voltage 12V DC networks present in motor<br>
vehicles. In particular, the method according to the<br><br>
present invention can be used to cause a vehicle device<br>
(such as a car headlamp for example) to send a piece of<br>
information about its state (on, off, out of order, etc.) .<br>
In the applications to direct current networks, the<br>
monitoring of the waveform of the voltage carried by the<br>
network is no longer necessary since as this voltage is<br>
direct, it always has an optimal value for the emission of<br>
the high frequency spurious pulses.<br>
As the present invention is based on a phenomenon little<br>
studied until now, it lies with those skilled in the art to complete<br>
the teaching that has just been described by experimental<br>
observations. Thus, further experiments have revealed that the<br>
amplitude of the connection spurious pulses can prove to be equal or<br>
even greater than that of the disconnection spurious pulses. This<br>
can particularly be observed by using as electric element a low-<br>
value resistor, for example of a few ohms, which is cyclically<br>
connected to the network with a very short connection time, for<br>
example a few microseconds, and which is thus passed through by a<br>
high current, for example several amperes, that does not interfere<br>
with the network due to its short duration. It can then be seen<br>
that the amplitude of the spurious pulses emitted when the resistor<br>
is disconnected from the network is substantially greater than that<br>
of the spurious pulses emitted when the resistor is connected to the<br>
network. In this case, the disconnection pulses can also be used as<br>
means of transmitting a piece of information, instead of the<br>
connection pulses. Furthermore, both types of connection and<br>
disconnection pulses can be detected to obtain a redundant piece of<br>
pulse detection information enabling the control signal to be<br>
reconstituted with greater reliability.<br><br>
