The present invention relates to 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-piperidine-l-carboxylic acid (4-<br>
methoxy-7-morpholin-4-yl-benzothiazol-2-yl)-amide, which a compound of formula<br><br>
and to pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof.<br>
 Surprisingly, it has been found that the compound of formula I is a high affinity, highly selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist with potent and long-acting in vivo oral antagonism of adenosine A2A receptor agonist-induced behavior.<br>
This compound is generically encompassed by WO 01/097786.<br>
Adenosine modulates a wide range of physiological functions by interacting with specific cell surface receptors. The potential of adenosine receptors as drug targets was first reviewed in 1982. Adenosine is related both structurally and metabolically to the bioactive nucleotides adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP); to the biochemical methylating agent S-adenosyl-L-methione (SAM); and structurally to the coenzymes NAD, FAD and coenzyme A; and to RNA Together adenosine and these related compounds are important in the regulation of many aspects of cellular metabolism and in the modulation of different central nervous system activities.<br>
The adenosine receptors have been classified as A1, A2A, A2B And A3 receptors,   belonging to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. Activation of adenosine receptors by adenosine initiates signal transduction mechanisms. These mechanisms are dependent on the receptor associated G protein. Each of the adenosine receptor subtypes has been<br>
Pop/09.02.2005    '<br><br>
classically characterized by the adenylate cyclase effector system, which utilises cAMP as a second messenger. The A1 and A3 receptors, coupled with G1 proteins inhibit adenylate cyclase, leading to a decrease in cellular cAMP levels, while A2A and A2B receptors couple to G, proteins and activate adenylate cydase, leading to an increase in cellular cAMP levels. It is known that the A1 receptor system activates phospholipase C and modulates both potassium and calcium ion channels. The A3 subtype, in addition to its association with adenylate cyclase, also stimulates phospholipase C and activates calcium ion channels.<br>
The A1 receptor (326-328 amino acids) was cloned from various species (canine, human, rat, dog, chick, bovine, guinea-pig) with 90-95 % sequence identify among the mammalian species. The A2A receptor (409-412 ammo acids) was cloned from canine, rat, human, guinea pig and mouse. The A2B receptor (332 amino adds) was cloned from human and mouse and shows 45 % homology with the human A1 and A2A receptors. The A3 receptor (317-320 amino acids) was cloned from human, rat, dog, rabbit and sheep.<br>
The A1 and AOA receptor subtypes are proposed to play complementary roles .in adenosine's regulation of the energy supply. Adenosine, which is a metabolic product of ATP, diffuses from the cell and acts locally to activate adenosine receptors to decrease the oxygen demand (Ai) or increase the oxygen supply (A2O and so reinstate the balance of energy supply: demand within the tissue. The actions of both, subtypes is to increase the amount of available oxygen to tissue and to protect cells against damage caused by a short term imbalance of oxygen. One of the important functions of endogenous adenosine is preventing damage during traumas such as hypoxia, ischemia, hypotension and seizure activity.<br>
Furthermore, it is known that the binding of the adenosine receptor agonist to mast cells expressing the rat A3 receptor resulted in increased inositol triphosphate and intracellular calcium concentrations, which potentiated antigen induced secretion of inflammatory mediators. Therefore, the A3 receptor plays a role in mediating asthmatic attacks and other allergic responses.<br>
Adenosine is a neurotransmitter able to modulate many aspects of physiological brain function. Endogenous adenosine, a central link between energy metabolism and neuronal activity, varies according to behavioural state and (patho)physiological conditions. Under conditions of increased demand and decreased avalability of energy (such as hypoxia, hypoglycemia, and/or excessive neuronal activity), adenosine provides a powerful protective feedback mechanism. Interacting with adenosine receptors represents a promising target for therapeutic intervention in a number of neurological and psychiatric diseases such as epilepsy, sleep, movement disorders (Parkinson or<br><br>
Huntington's disease), Alzheimer' s disease, depression, schizophrenia, or addiction. An increase in neurotransmitter release follows traumas such as hypoxia, ischemia and seizures. These neurotransmitters are ultimately responsible for neural degeneration and neural death, which causes brain damage or death of the individual. The adenosine A1 agonists mimic the central inhibitory effects of adenosine and may therefore be useful as neuroprotective agents. Adenosine has been proposed as an endogenous anticonvulsant agent, inhibiting glutamate release from excitatory neurons and inhibiting neuronal firing. Adenosine agonists therefore may be used as antiepileptic agents. Furthermore, adenosine antagonists have proven to be effective as cognition enhancers. Selective A2A antagonists have therapeutic potential in the treatment of various forms of dementia, for example in Alzheimer's disease, and of neurodegenerative disorders, e.g. stroke. Adenosine A2A receptor antagonists modulate the activity of striatal GABAergic neurons and regulate smooth and well-coordinated movements, thus offering a potential therapy for Parkinsonian symptoms. Adenosine is also implicated in a number of physiological processes involved in sedation, hypnosis, schizophrenia, anxiety, pain, respiration, depression, and drug addiction (amphetamine, cocaine, opioids, ethanol, nicotine, cannabinoids). Drugs acting at adenosine receptors therefore have therapeutic potential as sedatives, musde retaxants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, analgesics, respiratory stimulants, antidepressants, and to treat drug abuse. They may also be used in the treatment of ADHD (attention deficit hyper- activity disorder).<br>
An important role for adenosine in the cardiovascular system is as a cardioprotective agent Levels of endogenous adenosine increase in response to ischemia and hypoxia, and protect cardiac tissue during and after trauma (preconditioning). By acting at the A1 receptor, adenosine A1 agonists may protect against the injury caused by myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. The modulating influence of A2A receptors on adrenergic function may have implications for a variety of disorders such as coronary artery disease and heart failure. A2A antagonists maybe of therapeutic benefit in situations in which an enhanced anti-adrenergic response is desirable, such as during acute myocardial ischemia. Selective antagonists at A2A receptors may also enhance the effectiveness of adenosine in terminating supraventricula axrhytmias.<br>
Adenosine modulates many aspects of renal function, including renin release, glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow. Compounds which antagonize the renal affects of adenosine have potential as renal protective agents. Furthermore, adenosine A3 and/or A2B antagonists may be useful in the treatment of asthma and other allergic responses or and in the treatment of diabetes rnellitus and obesity.<br>

Cells were harvested, washed twice by centrifugation, homogenized and again washed by centrifugation. The final washed membrane pellet was suspended in a Tris (50 rnM) buffer containing 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2 and 10 mM MgCl2 (pH 7.4) (buffer A). The 3H SCH-58261 (Dionisotti et al, 1997, Br J Pharmacol 121, 353; 1 nM) binding assay was carried out in 96-well-plates in the presence of approximately 2.5 jig of membrane protein, 0.5 mg of Ysi-poly-1-lysine SPA beads and 0.1 U adenosine deaminase in a final volume of 200 fil of buffer. Nonspecific binding was defined using xanthine amine congener (XAC; 2μM). Compounds were tested at 10 concentrations from 10 μM - 0.3 nM. All assays were conducted in duplicate and repeated at least two times. Assay plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature before centrifugation and then bound ligand determined using a Packard Topcount scintillation counter.
