Bftckgronnd of the Invention fidd of the Invmtion<br>
The preset invration relates to digital processing systems implmieiited to support supply dhain manag^nrat^ and more ^)ecificaUy to a method and q&gt;paratus for detennining wfaetfier orders related to a &amp;mify of products can be promised.<br>
ReUtedArt<br>
Siq&gt;pl^ diain management (SCtA) systems g^iarally reiet to digital processing systems wfaidi enable one to plan/det^mine tiie availability of various products at the right time» in the right place, and in right conditioa SCM systems are oftei used in manufacturing plants to reduce invmtories at various levels, i.e., compon»ts used to build products; products shipped to the next party (e.g., retails) in &amp;e supply diain, etc., as is well knovm in the relevant arts.<br>
One common application of SCM systems is to determine whether an order can be promised or not As an illustration, a purdias^ may wish to purchase 1000 units to be delivered on a ^&gt;ecific future date, and the SCM system may need to indicate whether die quantity and deliv^ date requironents can be met based on tiie status of availability of various resources (e.g., componmts), and die time required at each stage to produce the product from the available resources.<br>
Manu&amp;cturingopoations often produce a &amp;mily of products. A &amp;mily of products generally refers to a groiq&gt; of products whidi share similarities in t^ms of resource requir^nmts. For example, an op^ation m^ manu&amp;cture Pq&gt;si, Mirinda, and Sprite (eadi product being refined to as a memba of die &amp;mily), ^;^ch use similar compon^its sudi as botdes of same shape, caps of same physical makeup (but with difii^mt label/color towards the rad), liquid, etc. In geiaetal^ die components share similar features to some extrat, but could differ (e.g., in color, logo, etc.) depending on the specific membtf in which die<br><br>
It may be desirable that a SCM system take advantage of such commonalities in detomining vdiether orders can be promised or not<br>
Snmmaiy<br>
An aspect of the present invmtion cables orders for member items of a&amp;mily of products to be promised by taking advantage of similarities in resource requirements of membtfitems. In an anbodim^t a computo-syston (digital processing syston) is operable to receive a time foice (TF) duration associated \vi&amp; eadi member item in relation to a firrt member item. The TF duration represents an amount of advance time duration after v^di ftic sapply of tiie corresponding member item is available to satisfy tfie dooand for said first member item.<br>
In one implonentation, the TF duration is equal for all pairs of mraiba itons and is referred to as agg^ate time fetkcc (ATF). The ATF duration is tiien used to promise orda^ potaitially based on aggr^ate availability of all member itmis (family of manba itans) in Ae postrATF duration*<br>
For illustration, it is assumed Aat a first ord^ is received ^&gt;ecifytng afirst quantity of Ac first member it«ti and a first required date, who'ein the first required date is after the ATF duration fi'om a time &amp;e first ord^ is received, and v^^ein only Qavail units of the first member item arc sdieduled to be available as of the first required date, v^^ein Qavail is less than tiie first quantity. The computer systan determines whedia' at least tfie first quantity of all of the member items (including &amp;e first manbar item) is sdieduled to be available as of die first required date. If such quantity is available, die computer syst«Q promises the first order.<br>
Furdio* features and advantages of the invention, as well as the structure and operation of various onbodimaits of the invoition, are desoibed in detail below with r^erence to the<br><br>

Detailed Descriptioii of The PrefiNTed Embodiments<br>
According to an aq)ect of tiie present invcaition, a digital processing system (herea&amp;et ^SCM system"*) supporting supply diain managemrat (SCM) det^mines whether an order related to afamily of products can be promised. An user m^ provide a parameter referred to as 'aggr^ate time fence* (ATF) duration rqiresrating an amount of advance time duration afteru^di aggn^ate siq)pty of all mmiber items is available to satisfy the demand for any mmibtf itaxL In otiier words, wi&amp;out sudi advance notice, it may not be possible to diange course so as to manufacture units of tiie anotiier membtf item using tiie units of the one membo- ttrai already in die process of being manufactured.<br>
Thus, whoi tiie desired quantity of a member item is not available as of a requested date (^^di is afto* tiie ATF duration) s^iecified in an otder^ tiie SCM ^stem examines the<br><br>
aggr^ate of sdieduled supplies of all membo- itcans on the requested date, and indicates that the order can be promised if the desired quantity of the member item can be supplied using sudi available supplies (of all the meoihcr items). As a result, an ospect of the pres»t invention takes advantage of die similarity of resource requirements/usage of tiie m^nbos of Ac &amp;mily to efiGciently use all the available units of die members of die &amp;mily to promise ord^s.<br>
Anodier zspcct of die pres»t invmtion pre-computes data representing the aggr^ate quantity available for all members of the family eadi day afitf die ATF point (i.e., the d^ after die ATF duration from a presnt day). Sudi pre-conq)uted data enables a SCM Systran toquid^detefmine^etherorderscanbeprocessed. The resulting features are particularly useful in oivinmments in v/bidk a large number of items are preset in a iamiy of interest<br>
Several a^&gt;ects of die invention are desmbed below with reference to examples for illustration. K should be understood that numerous ^&gt;ecific details, relationships, and me&amp;ods are set forth to provide a full understandiiig of the invention. One skilled in die relevant art, howev^, wiU readily recognize that die invttition can be practiced v^thout or more of die S9&gt;ecific details, or with other mediods, etc. In other instances, well-known structures or operations are not shown in detail to avoid obscuring the invoition.<br>

various aq)ects of &amp;e presmt invention.<br>
Intonet 130 provides connectivity between cliait systems 110-A through 110-M and ord^processing system ISO. Jntcmdt ISO may contain several devices (e.g., bridges, routers, modmis, commimication links» etc.,) opiating according to protocols sudi as TCP/IP well known m the relevant arts. Ebwever, odier forms (e.g., point-to-point private network using proprietary protocols or ATM-based network) can also be used to provide connectivity between tiic client systems and the ord^ processing system.<br>
Client systems 110-A through 110-M enable usets to place an order for a desired quantity of amember item of afsonily by a desired date, and to receive reqK&gt;nse indicating whedier a provider (e.g., a cotapaoy manufacturing the memba item) promises to fulfill the order by the desired date. Client systems may be implemmted using computer systems available from businesses sudi as Ddl, Compaq, Sun Microsystems, etc.<br>
Database servers 160-A through 160-Kprovidearq)ository for storing various pieces of information (or data) mdi as die member items in eadi £amily, the sdieduled sq&gt;ply of member it^ns for eadi day, ordets promised, etc. Some of tiie pieces of information may^ be generated from otiber systems, and stored in database servers 160-A Arough 160-K. Database servers can int^rated with order processing system 1 SO as a single unit<br>
In addition, database servers 160-A tiirou^ 160-K may store various pieces of information goierated by order (»x&gt;cessingsyst^n ISO \i^epn&gt;mising orders received from clientsystonsl 10-A through 110-M. bigaiaal,thedatabaseserversallowdatatobestored and retrieved using structured qumes, and m^ be implemented in aknown w^ using one of several conmiacialty available database products from conq&gt;anies sudi as Oracle, IBM, Mio'osof^ etc.<br>

AU Ibe components except di^l^ unit 270 m^ communicate with each otiiCT over communication padi 2S0, vMdk may contain sev^al buses as is well known in the relevant arts. The con^nmts of Figure 2 are desmbed below in fiirdier detail.<br>
Processing unit 210 m^ esoccatc instructions stored in RAM 220 to provide several features of the jmsent inventioa Processing unit 210 m£^ contain multiple processors, with eadi processor potmtially being designed for a sped&amp;c task. Aheraatively, processing imit 210 may contain only a single processor. RAM 220 m£^ receive instructions and data from secondary monory 230 and network intcdace 280 using communication path 2S0.<br>
Gn^hics controlltf 260 gmerates dispU^ signals (e.g., in RGB format) to Ssp\zy unit 270 based on dataAnstmctions received from Processing unit 210. Display unit 270 contains a di^l^screra to di^lay the images defined by the diq)l^ signals. Input int^fice 290 may correspond to a kev-board and/or mouse, and eenerallv oiables a us^ to nrovide various<br><br>
inputs (e.g., ATF duration). Network interface 280 enables some of the inputs (and outputs) to be provided on a network and also to intoface with database servers 160-A trough 160-K, DispkQT unit 270, input interface 290 and network interfece 280 nuqr be implemented i^<br>

Secondary memory 230 may store the data (e.g., ATF duration, mmber items in a&amp;mily, supply of eadi member tton in each 6ay^ etc.) and software instructions v^cesstng qrstem 1 SO to provide several features in accordance wi&amp; &amp;^ present inventioiL ScHue or all of the data and instructions nuiy be provided on removable storage unit 240, and &amp;e data and instructions m^ be read and provided by removable storage drive 237 to processing unit 210. Floppy drive, magnetic ts^drive^ CD-ROM drive, DVD Drive, Flash memory, removable memory chip (PCMCIA Card, EPROM) are exan^les of sudi removable storage drive 237.<br>
Ronovable storage unit 240 may be implemoited using medium and storage format compatible witii removable storage drive 237 sudi tiiat removable storage drive 237 can read the data and instructions. Thus, ronovable storage unit 240 includes a computer readable storage medium having stored tisercin computer software and/or data An cmhoSmeat of the pres^it invmtion is implemented using software rurming (that is» executing in order processing syston ISO.<br>

These compute program products are means for providing software to ord^ processing system 1 SO. Proces^ng unit 210 may retrieve &amp;e software instructions, and execute the instmctions to provide various features of die preset invration as described below in detail. The desoiption is continued wi&amp; re^&gt;ect to examples illustrating a marmer in vAddk several aspects of the presoit invoition m^ be implraimted.<br><br>
4* Promisiiig an Ordtr When the Expected Quantity Availability of a Member Item is Lett Than Desired Qnaatlty<br>
Figure 3 is a flow-diait illustrating &amp;e mann^ in wdudb an order for a m^nber item can be promised according to an a^&gt;ect of presoit invoition even if quantity expected to be available is less than die desired quantity indicated by an order. The flow-chart is described widi reftf^ce to Figures land 2 for illustration. Howev^» the method tjozy be implem^ted in oth^ environments as well. The mediod begins in step 301 in whidi control immediateiy passes to stq&gt; 310.<br>
In 8tq&gt; 310, order in-ocessing system ISO receives data indicating the monbers of a product &amp;mily» die ATF duration, and the quantity of siq^ly on eadi d^ for each member itmt Merdy for simpUcity, it is assumed dutf the ATF duration with req&gt;ect to any pair of member items is equal. Ifowever, the ATP duration can be difiTerent for difif^mt ordered pairs of member items, whidi could be the case if die d^ree of similarity (in resource usage) is d&amp;ffereat for diffactA ordered pairs. The in^)lemaitation of order processing system 150 widi sudi di£ferent ATF durations will be £^parait to one skilled in the relevant arts by reading the disclosure provided herda<br>
In step 330, order processing system ISO receives an order indicating required quantity (Qreq) of a q&gt;ecific memhct item and a required date P&amp;eq), widi the required date being after ATF duration from the present time. Such a data nu^ be sent by a user using one of climt systems before promising a customer diat die required quantity can be supplied on a required date. Altemativety, the customer nu^ be provided the ability to send the order directly to order processing ^stem ISO.<br>
In stqp 3S0, order proces^ng system ISO det^mines\\4iedier sufiBdent quantities of otho- monber itons (of the £amity) are sdiedided to be available after the ATF duration but by the requested date (Xreq). Order processing system 1 SO g^ierates a signal indicating that &amp;e order can be promised if sudi suffident quantities are determined to be available. Assuming that QSx rq&gt;resCTts the quantity of die ^&gt;ecific member it^ns expected to be<br><br>
/ [<br>
available as of the required date, at least (Qreq - Qbc) items need to available a&amp;cr the ATF duration from otiber monbtf items, but by the requested date pCreq).<br>
The me&amp;od ends in step 399. While &amp;e approach of Figure 3 p^tains to orders with required date vAdch is aft^ the ATF duration and with the required quantity being more than the quantity available as of the requested date, sudi approadi needs to operate integral to gmeral order processing. Some features of sudi a goieral order proccssmg approach in one embodim«t are desoibed below in further detail. First, tiie terminology onployed in such an embodiment is briefly noted.<br>
5* Tavittology<br>
The tenninology (v^di in turn illustrates the computations) en4&gt;loyed in an embodiment is briefly desmbed below. The manner in vAddk eadi item of the taminology can be determined (or computed) is desoibed in expropriate portions of the below sections witii reference to Figures S du'ough 10.<br>
TF (Time Fence) Duration: As noted above, repres»ts an amount of advance time duration after vMch &amp;e si^pty of one monber item is available to satisfy the demand for another member item.<br>
ATF Duration: Assuming the TF duration is equal for all pairs of m^nbo* items, the TF duration is referred to as ATF duration since die aggr^ate supply of all m^nber items is available to satisfy the demand for aiqr m^nber iton after tfie ATF duration.<br>
ATF Point: ATF duration counted from tiie presottt day (Ihe date in vHbich an order is received). In tilie illustrative eswaples desoibed below, the ATF point is shown between the 5^ and 6^ days corres^nding to ATF duration of 5 d^^s.<br>
Item simply: It is tiie total number units of an iton that are sdieduled to be available on tiie corre^nding day. In the illustrative example, it^n simply correi^nding to each of<br><br>
&amp;e items A and B b assumed to be 10 units p« day, as depicted in row^ the ATF duration) in Figure 5,<br>
licm donand: It is tiie total numbw of units of an item that are required to be delivered on a q)ecified day in view of the committed orders, irres9&gt;ective of whether sufficimt simply is available or not It^n draiand is updated in re^nse to each order as desmbed in sections below with exan^les.<br>
Item Budceted Allocation: The sum of tiie allocations on tiie given day in response to the demand for tiie sped&amp;c item witfiin or after the ATF duratioiL It^n bucketed allocati<m reprcseots tiie number of units allocated from the present item available for spcdgc witfiin atf. budcetcd allocation is only in atf duration.></m>
Net item ayailable: Iton siq&gt;pty less item budceted allocation on that day.<br>
Badcward consumption: Backward consumption for a ffvca day equals the number of units (quantity) of the item consumed from prior days to satisfy shortage of supply on the given d^ less the number of units made available to satisfy shortage of siq&gt;ply in friture d^s.<br>
Forward consun^on: Forward consumption for a given day equals the number of units (quantity) of &amp;e item consumed from future days to satisfy shortage of supply on the given day less the number of units made available to satisfy shortage of sq&gt;ply in prior days.<br>
Pres^ ban availability: Rq)resents the number of units (quantity) of the item available for friture orders in view of all tiie committed orders, aiul equals the net item available plus (forward consun4&gt;tion+badcward consumption). Present it^n availability is applicable only before ATF point<br>
Cumulative item availability: For agiven day before ATF point, equals aggregate of<br><br>
present item availability up to the given day. For agiveo day after ATF point, the cumulative item availability of the item at ATF point plus sum of presmt item availability of all the items in the femily after ATF point up to the given day.<br>
Family simply: Aggr^ate of iton si^plies in tiie product family in the corresponding (ky. For example, in Figure 5, the family siq&gt;ply is equal to 20 on each day (10 units from tnembct'A an410 units from monber-B).<br>
Family budceted allocation: Rq&gt;resmts the numbw of units allocated for &amp;e ^&gt;ecific date from the pool of units generated from all items of the fronily. Family bucketed allocation is f^^licable after ATF.<br>
Net family available: Family suppfy less funily budceted allocation on that day.<br>
Presoit Family availability: Rq&gt;re8ents tiie number of units of the ratire family available for future orders in view of all the committed orders^ and equals net family acvailability plus (forward consunq&gt;tion + badcward consumption). Preset Family acvailability is ^plicable only B&amp;et ATF period.<br>
The manner in vAdak ordets can be promised using tiie concq&gt;tual basis underlying sudi terminology is desoibed below witii several examples below.<br>
6. Processmg Ordttv<br>
Figure 4A, 4B and 4C are portions of a flow-diart \Adch togetha* illustrate a manner in whidi eadi order related to a frunify of products can be processed in an onbodime^t of ^^ presoit invmtioa The flow-duut is ^lit into separate Figures 4A» 4B and 4C merely for clarity. The metfiodb^ins in stq)401inwfaidi the control immediately passes to step 410.<br>
MA refo-ence to Figure 4A, in stq&gt; 405, ord» processing system 150 receives an order containisg required quantity (Qreq) and required date (Kreq) represrating an item<br><br>
demand coiresponding to a member ("ord«cd iten'*) of the product femily. The item demand for a member of tiie product &amp;mily tnay be provided by an user (e.g., a sales pason/custom&amp;t) to determine the availability of units corres^nding to a member item.<br>
In stq) 410, ordaprocessing ^stoi 1 SO receives dataindicating aggregate time fence (ATF) duration, siq&gt;ply-danand up to ATF point for the requested it^n, and aggregate si^ply-demand after ATF point<br>
In step 420, order processing ^stem 150 determines cumulative item availability for the requested member on eadid£^beforeATF point using fM-esent item availability. Instep 425, order processing gystem 150 determines the cumulative item availability for the requested member on eadidf^ after ATF using presmtfunity availability. An availability diagram is buik using 8iq[&gt;plies, present availabilities, cumulative availabilities etc.<br>
In stq) 435, order processing system 150 compare the ATF point widx &amp;e required date to detemune ^e&amp;er Xreq is within Ike ATF duration (from the present date). Control is transferred to step 437 (of Figure 4B) if the condition is true, otherwise to step 470 (of Figure 4Q. Thus, control is transferred to Figure 4B if the required date (Xfeq) is within the ATF duration and to Figure 4C odierwise.<br>
Wi^ reference to Figure 4B, in step 437, order processing system 150 determines the cumulative item availability of the ordered item on Xreq (QLc) using the computations performed in step 420. In step 440, order proces^ng system 150 detomines \^ether the required quantity (Qreq) is less tium or equal to cumulative item availability (QIx) on Xreq. Control is transferred to step 445 if the condition is true, otherwise to st^ 449.<br>
Jn step 445, ord^ processing system 150 allocate Qreq (required quantity) on Xreq (required date). As m£^ be appreciated, the allocation is based on availability of the requested quantity (Qreq) of the ord^ed item only, since tiie requested date (Xreq) is within the ATF duration  Control is thai transfored to stq&gt; 497 via coimectorF.<br><br>
In stq&gt; 449, cumulative item availability (Qatf) at ATF point for the requested item is detennined. Jn stq&gt; 450, order processing systmi ISO detennines whetha* the required quantity (Qreq) is less than or equal to cumulative item available on ATF (Qatf). Control passes to stq&gt; 4S1 if the condition is true, o&amp;owise to stqp 459.<br>
In stq&gt; 451, ord^ processing system 150 detomines i^^iether an override flag is set associated witfi die order. The override flag associated widi an order indicates tiiat attempt should be made to process tiie order as of tiie requested date. J£Ae flag is not set, the day (Xatp) on vMA Qreq is available is determined.<br>
In general, the fulfillment of tiie order is delayed till Xalp if override flag is not set associated vnAx an order, compared to scenarios if tiie flag is set Example q&gt;proaches on how to im&gt;cess an order in Ihc case of different values for tiie override flag, are described below. Control passes to stq) 452, if tiie condition (override flag being set associated with the order) is tru^ otiierwise to stq&gt; 453.<br>
In stqp 452&gt; Qreq is allocated on Kteq and tiie control is transfored to step 483 via cormector G. As desoibed below widi reference to Figure AC, Hit ordo* is being accepted with potential^ tiie requested date pCreq) not being met (unless some of the ord^^ become unsdieduled lata-).<br>
In stq&gt; 453, order processing system 150 detomines the day (Xatp) on v^ch Qreq is available. Jxk stq&gt; 455, order processing systmi 150 determines v^^eth^Xa^ is within an accq&gt;tablewindowfromtiierequesteddate]&amp;eq. bi an embodiment, while placing an order, the user is provided tiie option of specifying a ruimber of d^s fix&gt;m Xreq, whidi would be accqytabletotheuser. Thus, control passes to stq) 456 ifXa^ is witiiin such an acceptable window, and othowise to stq&gt; 498 via connector E. In stqp 456, order processing system 150 allocates Qreq on Xa^.<br>
In stq&gt; 459, ord^ processing system 150 detamines ^edi» a override flag is set<br><br>
associated with the otda. The ov^ride flag associated with an order indicates that attempt should be made to process the ordo" by allocating from family availability to meet the shortage in fulfilling Qreq. Control passes to step 463 if Ac condition is true (ov^de flag setX otiiov/iseto stq&gt; 460.<br>
Stq) 460 is readied if suffici»t quantity is not available as of bo&amp; the ATF point (as in stq&gt; 450) and requested date (st^440X and ovenide flag is not set (step 4S9). In step 460, order processing system 1 SO determines tiie day pCatp) (available to promise) on v^ch Qreq of the ordered item is available^ and tiie corre^nding cumulative hem availability (Qa^) on that day.<br>
Jn 8tq&gt; 461, ord^ processing system ISO determines vihtQiet Xatp is witiun an accqytableivindowfiomtherequesteddateXreq. In an embodiment, ^vhile placing an order, the user is jnovided the option of specifying a number of d^s from Xreq, vA^ch would be acceptable to tiie user. Thus, control passes to stq&gt; 466 ifXa^ is within sudi an acceptable window, and otherwise to stq&gt; 498 via connector E.<br>
In step 466, order processing system 1 SO det^mines Aether the C^req of the ordered item is available based on surplus cumulative item availability bctwera tixe ATP point (Xa^)and the ATF point by conq&gt;aring Qreq with (Qa^-Qatf). Control passes to step 467 if Qreq is less than (Qaip - Qatf), otherwise to stq&gt; 464.<br>
In stq&gt; 464, order processing system ISO allocates (Qatp - QatQ on Xa^ and the remaining quantity ((^req - Qatp+QatO on tile last d^ of ATF duration and control pass^ to stq&gt; 483 via connector G. In stq&gt; 467, ordo* processing systm ISO allocates Qreq on Xatp and control passes to stqp 483 via connector G.<br>
Now continuing &amp;e desmption wiA reference to Figure 4C, it is first noted that connector B passes control to stq&gt; 470 in case tiie required date (Xreq) is after the ATF poin^ hi step 470, order processing syston ISO det^mines the cumulative itmi availability (Qbc)<br><br>
on the requested date p&amp;eq) using present item awailab^^<br>
presmt &amp;mily availability aAct ATF. As noted above, &amp;c cumulative item availability of the ordtfed iton on a d^ after &amp;e ATF point equals the cumulative itmi availability of the item at ATF point plus sum of presesit item availability of all &amp;e items in the family afler ATF point up to %^eq.<br>
In step 47S, order processing system ISO detomines i^ettier Qreq is less than or equaltoQbc Control is transferred to stq&gt; 480 ifsudi a condition is true, oth^ivise to step 485. In stq&gt; 480, a determination is made as to Aether Qreq is less tiian or equal to (QIx-Qatf). Control is transferred to stq) 481 if such a condition is tni^ otherwise control is transferred to stq&gt; 482.<br>
^ step 481, order processing system ISO allocates Qreq on ]&amp;eq. In otiier words, the quantity is aUocated fix&gt;m tilie units available fiom tfie entire fionity afbr t^^ By mch an allocation, the units available in tfie ATF duration can potratially be used to |m&gt;mise orders with required dates witfiin ATF duratioa Control is then transferred to step 497.<br>
In stq&gt; 482, order processing ^stem ISO allocates (QJx - Qatf) on Xreq and the ranainingrequiredquantity(Qreq-QIx+Qatf)(mtfielastdayoftfaeATFduration. Again, as in stq&gt; 481, as maay units as possible are allocated first from die aggr^ate number of units available from the entire family, and onty the remaining units are allocated from the available quantities of &amp;e sped&amp;c ordered item. Control is then transferred to step 497.<br>
In stqp 48S, order processiog system ISO determines \^edier the item d^nand is ovoridden. Control is transferred to stq&gt; 491 if the condition is true, otherwise to step 492. bi stq&gt; 491, order processing system ISO allocates (Qreq - QatQ on Xreq, and Qatf on ATF, maintaining the allocation dates close to required date (Xreq) as desoibed above. Control is thai transfored to stq&gt; 483 via connector G. Jn step 492, order processing system 150 detmnines ATP date (Xaip) and &amp;e corre^nding cumulative item availability (i.e., Qatp),<br><br>
as desoibed above with reference to step 460.<br>
In stq&gt; 493, ord^ processing system ISO detmnines vdiethw Xa^ is within an accq&gt;table window from the requested date Xreq. In an embodiment^ while placing an order, the user is provided the option of specifying a number of days from Xreq, ^^ch would be accq)table to the usa. Thus, control passes to stq&gt; 494 ifXa^ is within such an acceptable window, and otherwise to step 498 via connector E.<br>
In stq&gt; 494, order processing system ISO determines whether Qreq is less than or equal to (Qa^ - Qatf). Control is transferred to stq&gt; 49S if die condition is true, otherwise tostq&gt;496. bi8tq&gt;49S,wder processing system 1 SO aUocates quantity Qreq on ATP date Xa^, and die control is transferred to stq&gt; 483 via connector G. Inst^496, ord^ processing system 1 SO allocates a quantity of (Qa4&gt;-Qatf) on Xreq, and (Qreq-Qa^ -K^atf) on Xatf and control is then transferred to stq&gt; 483 via connector G.<br>
In stqp 483, order processing system ISO mables the order to be accepted, possibly by indicating (corre^K&gt;nding Xatp date) tiiat tiie ordo* is likefy to be dek^ed. In step 497, order processing systod ISO indicates that the order can be promised (or promises the order). In step 498, order iMX&gt;cessing gystem ISO rejects (i.e., no promise, no accq&gt;t) the order. The method »ds in stq&gt; 499.<br>
Thus, die q&gt;proad)ies of above can be used to process orders according to various as;&gt;ects of die i^esent invention. Jn gmaal, order processing system ISO needs to perform several coniputations and keq&gt; trade ofseveral variables v^e processing die ord«^. Some exan4)le8 are provided below widi reference to Figures S-10 illustrating sudi computations and variable values as successive orders are processed in an example embodimmt The start state in sudi an embodimoit is desoibed first widi referoice to Figure S.<br>
7. Start State<br>
Figure S contains a table illustrating a start state assuming diat no prior orders are<br><br>
received merely for illustration. Table SOO contains numbos assuming that there are only two monber items (item-A and item-B), eadi with a corres^nding daify it^n-suppty of 10 units^ and \vith a ATF duration of S d£^s. Table SOO (as are tables of otho* Figures 6A, 6B, 7-11, but with different row numbers) is shown containing rows &amp;mify siq&gt;pty 570, ^mily budceted allocation 571, net &amp;mily available 572, badcward consumption 573, net + badnvard con5unq&gt;tion 574, forward congimption 575, and present Haanfy availability 578 for the oitire famify of products.<br>
Table 500 further contains item s^&gt;ply-A 580, item demand 581, hem bucketed allocation 582, net item-a available 583, badcward consumption 584, net + backward consumption 585, f(»ward consun^on 586, pteseot item-A availability 588, and cumulative item-A available 589 for ttem-A. Similar rows 590-596 and 598-599 are shown for item-B. Only various rows of interest are described vAAk rrference to each table below merely for conciseness.<br>
As ATF duration is indicated to be 5 days, die ATF point is shown between days 5 and day 6 wi&amp; a dark line. The entries correq&gt;onding to budceted allocations (rows 582,592 and 571), badcward consumption (rows 573,584, and 594), forward consumption (rows 575, 586,596), item demands (rows 581 and 591) are shown with 0 value as no ord^^ have been processedyet<br>
Famify supply 570 is shown containing 20 units for each day^ rc^esmtixig 10 units of si4&gt;ply for each member item shown in rows 580 and 590. Present tt^n availability (rows 588 and 598) is shown as 10 units in eadi day.<br>
Cumulative item availability (589 and 599) is shown witii ino-emmts of 10 (i.e., 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 in the five days re^&gt;ectivefy) in successive entries before ATF date. However, afte* ATF date, Ac cumulative it^i avaik^ility (589 and 599) is shown with values of 70, 90 and 110 req&gt;ectively rq)res»ting the cumulative item availability at the ATF point plus tiie preset fiunily availability 578 in eadi entry.<br><br>

8« Procetting Orders When the Required JUdt is Within ATF Duration and the Requu^ Quantity of Ae Orda*ed Item is Scheduled to be Available<br>
For illustration^ it is assumed that an order for 30 units of item-A wi&amp; arequired date of d^ 3 is received vvhen the status is rq&gt;resented by Figure S. The manna^ in &gt;^ch the order is processed is described widi combined refermce to Figures 1,4A, 4B» 4C and 5 for illustration.<br>
As may be readily ^ypreciated, order {vocessing gystem ISO determines that the required date p&amp;eq) is \vithin the ATF duration (smce Xreq is less tiian Xatf) in step 43S. Control accordingly passes to stq&gt; 437» in vvhidi wder processing system 150 examines cumulative item availability S89 on ds^ 3 (having a value of 30) to determine tiiat sufficient quantity of die ordered item is sdieduled to be available to promise tiie order. Accordingly, order processing system ISO may promise the order.<br>
tt m^ be £^predated that the order of above is promised based on a single look-up of the relevant table/data&gt; aiul widiout requiring substantial computation once the order is recdved. Accordingly, order processing system ISO may be able to goia'ate a quick response v^en an order is received even if tfnere are many order items wi&amp;in a family. To continue to provide sudi quidc res^nses, various ratries of table SOO m^ need to be modified after promising the above^oted order. Sudi modifications are illustrated with reference to Figure 6A.<br>
Figure 6A is shown containing table 600 rq&gt;resenting the values of various entries once die above noted order (Qreq = 30 units, and Xreq - day 3) is processed in relation to table 500 of Figure S. Only the dififo^ccs of table 600 from table SOO, and required confutations are descnbed briefly in detail.<br><br>
The item demand and item budceted allocation rows on day (Xreq = day 3) are incremented by (Qrcq = 30), and the resulting value 30 is shown in rows 631 and 632. The net itcm-A available (of row633)on each d^^ up to d^ 3 is equal to item-A supply less item-A bucketed danand allocation correq&gt;onding to each day (up to d£^3) and is equal to 10,10, and -20. The negative sign associated with 20 (on d£^ 3)indicates tiie shortage of 20 units on d£^ 3 to fulfil Qreq (as 10 units are already available on d^ 3).<br>
The badcward consumption (of row 634) value correq&gt;onding to day lequals -10 (0-10), as 0 units are consumed from previous days (prior to day 1) ami 10 units (equal to net item availability of day 1) is made available to satisfy Qreq = 30 on day 3. Similarly, badcward consumption value for d£^s 2, and 3 are respectively equal to -10 (0-10), and +20 (20-0). The amative sign associated witii 10 on day 1 and 2 indicates that the net item-A available on day land d^ 2 is consumed to meet required quantity (Qreq = 30) on day 3. A value of+20 on day 3 indicates that a total of 20 unite is consumed from previous days net item availability.<br>
Net +bac]cward consumption (in row 635) is computed by adding the values of net item-A available and badcward consumption corresponding to eadi d^ and is equal to 0 on eadxdayupto(Xfeq=3). Asaggr^ateofnetiton-Aavailableoneadiday uptoday 3 is sufficiait to promise tiie ordered tt^n, forward consumption (in row 636) for each day is equal to 0. Badcward consumption and forward consumption correq&gt;onding to each day is shown merely for und^standing. Howevo', tiie values of net iton-A availability, Net+badcward consumption m^^ be stored for fur&amp;tf use.<br>
Pres^it item-A availability (of row 638) is det^mined by adding the values of Netfbaclcward consumption and forward consumption corre^nding to each d^ and is equal to 0 iq) to (Xreq = day 3). The cumulative item-A availability (of row 639) on each day is det^mined by adding the cumulative it^n-A availability of previous day with the preset it^n-A availability on that day and is equal to 0 up to day 3. The cumulative item~A availability on day 4 equals 10 (i.e.,O+10), and on day S equals 20 (10+10). The cumulative<br><br>
item availability on day 6 equals 40 (20 units available on d^Qr 5 plus 20 units of present &amp;mily availability on day 6)^ and that of 7,and 8 equals 60 and 80.<br>
Once computations such as above are pofomied and die q&gt;propiiate values for the entries are deteraiined^ the next otdet may be received and processed quickly. For illustration, it is assumed that an order for 20 units of item-B vntii a required date (Xreq ^ day 2) is received v^en tfie status is rq&gt;resrated by Figure 6A.<br>
As may be readily ^preciated, order processing system 150 determines that the required date (Xreq) is within the ATF duration in step 435. Control accordingly passes to stqp 437, in \^di order processing syston 1 SO examines cumulative itcm-B availability 649 on day 2 (equal to 20) to determine that sufficient quantity of ordered item is available to promise the order.<br>
Accordingly, order processing system 150 may promise the orda* quickly as only values correq)onding to itrai-B needs to be examined, various oitries of table 600 may need to be modified afto* promising the above-noted ordo*. The status z&amp;cr modification is reflected by the contents of table 650 Figure 6B. Only the diffd-ences of table 650 fi-om table 600, and the required computations are desoibed briefly in detail.<br>
The item demand and item budceted allocation rows on day (Xreq = day 2) are ino-emented by (Qreq = 20), and the resulting value 20 is shown in rows 691 and 692 of day 2. The net itrai-B available (of row 693)on day 1 and 2 is equal to 10, and -10. The negative sign associated with 10 (on day 2)indicates a shortage of 10 units on d£^ 2 to fiilfill Qreq (as only 10 units are available on day 2). Net iton-B available on eadi day is computed similar to conq)utation of net iicmrA available as desc^bed above.<br>
The backward consumption (of row 694) value corresponding to day 1 equals -10 (0-10), as 0 units are consumed from previous d£^s (to satisfy shortage on day 1) and 10 units (equal to net item availability of day 1) is made available to satisfy Qreq = 20 on day 2.<br><br>
Similarly, hanckwBtd consumption value for day 2 is equal to +10 (10-0). The negative sign associated witii 10 on da^ 1 indicates that the net item-B available on day 1 is consumed (by demand on d^ 2) to meet required quantity (Qreq = 20) on day 2. A value of+10 on day 2 indicates tiiat a total of 10 uruts is consumed from previous d£^s siq)plies.<br>
Net -(-backward consumption (in row 695) is computed by adding the values of net item-B available and backward consumption corresponding to eadi d^ and is equal to 0 on day 1 and 2 (i.e., iq&gt; to Xreq = 2). As aggr^ate of net item-B available on day 1 and 2 is sufGcimt to promise tiie ordered item, forward consumption (in row 696) for day land 2 equals 0. The values of net iiemrB availability, NetH&gt;adcward consumption tx\ay be stored forfiirtiieruse.<br>
Present itm-B availability (of row 698) is determined by adding tiie values of Netfbadcward consumption and forward consumption corres^nding to each day and is equal to 0 on day 1 and 2. The cumulative item-B availability (of row 699) on day land 2 is det^mined by adding the cumulative item-B availability of previous day with the present item-B availability on tiuit d^ and is equal to 0 up to ds^ 2. The cumulative item-B availability from day 3 to d2^ S is respectively equal to 10,20, and 30 and that of day 6, 7 and 8 (after ATF point) equals SO, 70, and 90 respectivety. The cumulative item-B availability is confuted similar to that of cumulative itaa-A availability as described above.<br>
The desoiption is continued with reference to processing an order v/hcn the required date is after ATF duration and reqiured quantity (Qreq) of item-A is available, but using the units sdieduled to be produced for oth^ membo^ of tiie frimity after ATF point.<br>
9. Processing Orders When the Reqaired Date is Aftw ATF Daration and the Requi^ Quantity is Schedoied to be Available<br>
For illustration, it is assumed tiiat an order for 50 units of item-A with a required date (Xreq = day 7) is received vAien the status is rq&gt;resented by Figure 6B. Order processing systmi ISO det^mines that tiie required date (Xreq) is after tiie ATF duration in step 435<br><br>
Control accordingly passes to stq) 470, in ^^ch ordw processing syst«n 150 examines cumulative it&amp;a-A availability 689 on day 7 (equal to 60) to det^mine that sufficient quantity of ordered itetn is available to promise the order.<br>
Accordingly, ordo- processing system ISO may promise tiie order quickly as only values correq&gt;onding to it^n-A and fiEimily needs to be examined (as values in the family are pre-computed to represent tiie supplies available aft^ allocation of ordar it^ns belonging to a memb^ of tiie family). Various mtries of table 650 may need to be modified after promising tiie above-noted order. Table 700 of Figure 7 reflects the status after the modifications are performed.<br>
Figure 7 is shown containing table 700 rq&gt;res»iting die values of various entries once the above noted ordo* (Qteq - 50 units, and 'Xieq - day 7) is processed in relation to table 650 of Figure 6B. Only the differmces of table 700 fix&gt;m table 650, and required computations are desoibed briefly in detail.<br>
The item demand (of row 781) on day 7 is inctementdd by 50, family bucketed allocation (of row 771) on day (Xfeq = day 7) is inaemented by 40, and item bucketed allocation (of row 782) is ino-emmted by 10 on day 5. It m^ be appreciated that allocations are performed from only two buckets (one from the supply available for tiie corresponding member item and the odier fi^m the supply available for fht eatixc fsonily) irre^&gt;ective of the number of items available from die frunily. As a result, die order can be promised quickly even in complex environmmts. The modifications correq&gt;onding to family are described first, thtti the modifications correq&gt;onding to mraibtf itrad-A are des^bed.<br>
The net family available (of row 772) on days 6 and 7 is re^&gt;ectively equal to 20 and -20. The net frunily available on d^ 6 is equal to family supply (equal to 20) less family bucketed allocation (equal to 0) corresponding to day 6. Similarly, on day 7 net family available is equal to -20 (i.e., frimily supply of 20 less die fiimily bucketed allocation equal to 40).<br><br>
Badcward consumption (of row 773) for day 6 equals -20 (as the quantity consumed to satisfy tiie demand on d£^ 6 from previous d^s supplies (equal to 0) less the quantity made available (equal to 20 from supplies available on day 6) to satisfy required quantity on day 7). Similarly, badcward consumption value on day 7 m£^ be computed and is equal to +20. Net+backward consun4)tion (of row 774) on day 6 and 7 is equal to 0 (adding corres^nding values of row 772 and 773).<br>
Present fEunily availability (of row 778) corres^nding to d£^s 6 and 7 respectively equals 0 (as the sum of correq)onding values in row 774 and 775 equals 0). It msy be q&gt;preciated that a quantity as much as possible is allocated from frunily pool (after ATF point) and die remaining quantity is allocated on a day (within ATF duration) close to the required d^ ()&amp;eq) (as desmbed above wifli referoice to stq&gt; 482).<br>
Item-Abuadcward consunq&gt;tion (of row 785) is equal to 0 (sum of cofre^nding values in row 783 and 784). Presoit it»i-A availability (of row 788) is equal to 0 (sum of correqx&gt;nding values in row 785 and 786). The cumulative item-A availability on d£^ 5 equals 10 (widiin ATF duration) and on day 6^ 7 and 8 is respectively equal to 10,10 and 30. The cumulative ttcm availability may be computed as described above widi referrace to row 689 of Figure 6B.<br>
The desoiption is continued with tektexicc to processing an order v^en the required date ()&amp;eq)is afio* ATF duration and required quantity (Qreq) of itrai-A is not scheduled to be available.<br>
10.   Processing Orders When the Required Date is After ATF Duration and the Required Quantity is Not Scheduled to be Available<br>
For illustration, it is assumed that an ord^ for 65 units of item-B with a required date (Xreq = day 8) is received v4en the status is represented by Figure 7. Order processing<br><br>
syston ISO detomines dmt the required date pCreq) is aftar the ATF duration in step 43S Control accordingly passes to step 470, in v/hich ord^ processing system ISO examines cimiulative iton-B availability 799 on d^ 8 (equal to 50) to det^mine that sufficient quantity of ordered item is not sdieduled to be available. Control thm passes to step 485<br>
In step 485, order processing syst^n 150 det^mines vdiettier item demand is overridden with re^&gt;ect to item-B. If it is not overridden, control passes to step 492. For illustration, it is assumed tiiat tiie iteai donand is ov^ddoi for item-B. Accordingly, control passes to step 491.<br>
Various allocations are performed as noted in st^ 491, and the order is indicated to be accqrted Various ratries of table 700 may need to be modified after accepting the above-noted order. The modifications of table 800 from table 700 are briefly noted below.<br>
Figure 8 is shown containing table 800 representing the values of various entries once die above noted order (Qreq = 65 units, and Xreq = day 8) is processed in relation to table 700 of Figure 7. Only Iht diffidences from table 700, and required computations are desoibed briefly in detail.<br>
The item demand (of row 891) on d^ 8 is incremented by 65, frunily bucketed allocation (of row 871) on day (Xreq = d£^ 8) is inccemcatcd by 35, and it^n-B bucketed allocation (of row 892) is inaoiented by 30 on day 5. First die modifications corresponding to frunily are described th^i tiie modifications correq&gt;onding to it»n-B is described.<br>
The net &amp;mily available (of row 872) on day 8 is equal to -15 (family supply (equal to 20) less family bucketed allocation (equal to 35) corresponding to day 8). Backward consumption (of row 873) for day 8 equals 0 (as zero quantity is available to be consumed from d^ 6 and 7 to satisfy the d^nand on day 8). Neti4&gt;ackward consumption (of row 874) on day 8 is equal to -15 (adding corre^nding values of row 872 and 873).<br><br>
Forward consumption (of row 875) on day 8 equals IS, indicates that a supply from a future day (not shown)is required to be consumed to satisfy &amp;e &amp;mily bucketed allocation quantity (of 35 units). Preset family availability (of row 878) corresponding to day 8 is equal to 0 (as the sum of corresponding values in row 874 and 875 equals 0). It may be £q&gt;preciated tiiat unavailable quantity of 15 units (shown within brackets)is indicated in the £unily bucketed allocation (of row 871), and only scheduled quantity of units available is indicated corres^nding to member item-B within tiie ATF duration.<br>
Itan*B budceted allocation (of row 892) at ATF point (on d^ 5) equals 30 (as indicated in stq&gt; 491). The net item-B available (of row 893) b equal to -20 (corresponding value of row 890 (equal to 10) less the value in row 892 (equal to 30)). Backward consumption (of row 894) is equal to -10 on day 3 indicating that 10 units available on day3 is consumed by tiie demand of 30 units on day5» similariy^ badcward consumption for day 4 is also shown equal to -10. Badcward consumption on day 5 is equal to 20, as 10 units from eadi of d^s 3 and 4 is consumed by tiie iton-B budgeted allocation on d£Qr 5.<br>
Netfbadcward consumption (of row 895) on days 3,4, and 5 are respectively equal to 0 (sum of corres^nding values in row 893 and 894). Present item-B availability (of row 898) on days 3,4, and 5 are re^)ectively equal to 0 (sum of correq)onding values in row 895 and 896). The cumulative item-B availability on days 3; 4, and 5 equals 0 (within ATF duration) and on days 6,7 and 8 is req&gt;ectively equal to 0. The cumulative item availability may be computed as desoibed above with reference to row 799 of Figure 7.<br>
The desmption is continued with refo'cnce to processing an orda \dien the required date is within the ATF duration and required quantity ((^eq) of iton-A is not scheduled to be available as of die required date.<br>
11*  Processing Orders When the Required Date is Within ATF Duration and the Required Quantity is Not Schedaled to be Available<br>
For illustration, it is assumed ftat an ord^ for 20 units of item-A with a required date<br><br>
P&amp;cq = day 1) is received vAiea Ac status is represmted by Figure 8, Order processing system ISO determines that the required date p&amp;ecO is within the AT^ Control accordingly passes to step 437» in v^ch order processing system 150 examines cumulative item-A availability 889 on d^ 1 (equal to 0) to det^mine that sufficient quantity of ordtf ed item is not available to promise tiie order.<br>
Again assuming that the ovoride flag is set (stq&gt; 459), control is eventually transferred to step 463 (via steps 437,440,449,450, and 459). In step 463, Qatf (equaling 10) is allocated on Xreq (day 1), and the rraiaining quantity (20-10=10) is allocated on ATF+1 day, vMdti equals day 6. The allocation on ATF+1 are indicated to be unavailable, as rq&gt;reseQted by parenthesis around 10 in day 6, row 971. Various »tries of table 800 may need to be modified after promising tiie above-noted order. The modifications of table 900 fi-om table 800 is des^bed below.<br>
Figure 9 is shown containing table 900 rq&gt;resenting the values of various entries once tiie above noted order (Qreq = 20 units, and Xreq - d^y 1) is processed in relation to table 800 of Figure 8. Only the differmces from table 800, and required computations are desoibed briefly in detail.<br>
The item demand (of row 981) on day 1 is incremented by 20, family bucketed allocation (of row 971) on day 6 is incremoited by 10 (shown within bradcets, indicating sufficient supplies are not available to meet the draoand), and item-A budgeted allocation (of row 982) is ino'emented by 10 on day 1. First tbe modifications correqK&gt;nding to family are desoibed then die modifications corre^nding to item-A is desoibed.<br>
The net family available (of row 972) on d^ 6 is equal to 10 (family supply (equal to 20) less frunily bucketed allocation (equal to 10) corresponding to d^y 6). Netfbackward consumption (of row 974) on day 6 is equal to 0 (adding corresponding values of row 972 and 973) as backward consumption (of row 973) for d^y 6 equals -10 (as only 10 units (out of 20 available on day 6) may be made available to meet the shortage on day 7). Similarly,<br><br>
Nrt+4&gt;adbvard consumption on day 7 equab -10 (-20+10), as b^<br>
equals 10 (as only 10 units available on day 6 are consumed to meet the shortage on day?).<br>
Forward consumption (of row 975) on d£^ 7 equals 10, indicating tiiat a supply (of 10 units) from a future day (not shown)is required to be consumed to satisfy the family budceted allocation quantity (of 40 units). It may be q)preciated tiiat unavailable quantity of 10 units (shown within parmdiesis/bradcets)is indicated in the family bucketed allocation (of row 971X resulting in only available quantity of units (i.e., 10 units available within the ATF duration is indicated on Xreq = 1) to be indicated corresponding to member item-A widiin dxe ATF duration.<br>
Item-A bucketed allocation (of row 982) on d2^ 1 (witiiin Ike ATF point) equals 10. The net item-A available (of row 983) is equal to 0 (correq&gt;onding value of row 980 (equal to 10) less the value in row 982 (equal to 10)). Netfbadcward consumption (of row 985) on day lis equal to 0 (sum of corre^nding values in row 983 and 984) as backward consumption (of row 984) is equal to 0 on day 1 indicating that 0 units are consumed from supplies available prior to d^ 1 and 0 units are supplied to meet the shortage on a future date. NetfBadcward consumption on d^^ 3 is equal to -10 as badcward consumption is equal to 10 (as only 10 units available on d^ 2 is consumed to meet demiand on d^3).<br>
Forward consun^on (of row 986) on d£^ 1 equals 0 (indicating that a supply of 0 units is consumed from a future day (i.e., d^ 4) to meettiiie shortage on day 1 and 0 units are made available to meet tfie shortage on a previous d£^s prior to day 1) and timt of day 4 equals -10, as 10 units are made available to meet tiie shortage on a previous day (i.e., day 3). Forward consun^ition on day 3 is equals 10 (indicating that 10 units are consumed from supplies avaikJ&gt;le on a future day (day 4)). Preset iton-A availability (of row 988) on day 4 is equal to 0 (sum of corre^nding values in row 985 and 986). The cumulative item-A availability on eadi of the days 4-8 (before and aft» ATF) equals 0. The cumulative item availabihty m^ be computed as described above with refi^mce to row 889 of Figure 8.<br><br>
Thus, orders may be accepted with tiie e3q&gt;ectation that the required date is not being committed to, but tiiat an attempt will be made to commit to the required date. Order processing syst«n 150 m^ commit to the required date, for example, if previously promised ordo^ are unscheduled, as desoibed below witii an example.<br>
12. Unschedulmg Order Which Wu AUocated Qaanthy Only Within ATF duration It m^ be s^preciated that quantity of a m^nba iiaa v^ch is scheduled to be available within tiie ATF duration, m^ be optimally used to produce items of the same memhct iUm only.  Thus, die freed itons are used to satisfy demand related to orders requiring the q&gt;ecific same member item only.<br>
For illustration, it is assumed diat an order widi a required quantity of 30 units of member-A and a requested day of day 3 is un-sdieduled v/btn the status is as depicted in Figure 9. From Figure 6A, it may be q&gt;preciated tiuit all die 30 units were allocated based on quantities sdieduled to be available widiin ATF duration. Theunmetdofiandof lOunits in day 6 is caused due to order for membo* iton-A as desoibed above with reference to Figure 9.<br>
Tbm, die un-sdieduled quantity of member item-A may be utilized to satisfy the unmctdemandforallocationsofl0unitsindicatedwithinbradcetsinrow971 ond^6. The remaining freed 20 units are shown to be available for friture orders, as may be observed in row 1089 of Figure 10.<br>
The table of Figure 10 contains the status of die table after meeting such demand. Onfy the differences of table 1000 (of Figure 10) from table 900 are described for concisMcss. First the modifications corres^nding to family are described then the modifications correq)onding to item-A is desoibed.<br>
The famify bucketed allocation (of row 1071) on d£^ 6 is deo-emmted by 10 resulting in 0 allocation on day6, and item-A budceted allocation (of row 1082) on day lis<br><br>
iiu^einetited by 10 resulting in item-A bucketed demand equaling 20. The net f ami ly available (of row 1072) on day 6 is equal to 20 (family supply (equal to 20) less family bucketed allocation (equal to 0) corres^nding to day 6).<br>
Nctfbackward consumption (of row 1074) on day 6 is equal to 0 (adding correq&gt;onding values of row 1072 and 1073) as backward consumption (of row 1073) for day 6 ronains unchanged (equals -20). Forward consumption (of row 1075) on day 6 equals 0, indicates that no supply from a future day is consumed as tibe &amp;mily bucketed allocation quantity is equal to 0.<br>
The net itemrA available (of row 1083) is equal to -10 (correq&gt;onding value of row 1080 (equal to 10) less the value in row 1082 (equal to 20)). Badcward consumption (of row 1084) on d£^ 1 is now equal to 0 (as 0 units are consumed from previous days supply to satisfy the demand on day 1 and 0 units are made available to satisfy demand on a future d£^X similarly, badcward consumption on d£^s 2 to S equals 0. Netfbadcward consumption (of row 108S) on d£^ 2 and 3 is equal to 10 (sum of corres^nding values in row 1083 and 1084).<br>
Forward consun^tion (of row 1086) on day 1 equals 10 (indicating that a supply of 10 units is consumed from afiiture day (i.e., day 2) to meet the shortage on day 1 and 0 units are made available to meet the shortage on a previous days prior to day 1) and that of day 2equals -10, as 10 units are made available to meet the shortage on a previous day (i.e., day 1). Presoit item-A availability (of row 1088) on day 3 and 4 is equal to 10 (sum of correq&gt;onding values in row 108S and 1086). The cumulative iton-A availability on days 3,4, and 5 (within ATF duration) is respectively equal to 10,20, and 20,and on days 6,7 and 8 (after ATF duration) is respectively equal to 20.<br>
An unscheduled quantity within the ATF duration m^ be utilized to satisfy an accepted order corresponding to a matnb^ item (e.g., memba item A) as described above. Order processing system ISO may commit to the required date, for example, if previously<br><br>
promised orders afte ATF duration arc unscheduled, and is described below with an example.<br>
12. Unschednling Order Which Was Afflocated Qaantity both Within and After ATF Doration<br>
As may be appreciated, v.^en the freed quantity is scheduled to be available in the post-ATF duration, the freed quantity can be used for satisfying the dmiands of orders related to any membtf item. On the otho* hand, as illustrated above with ref^ence to Figure 10, if the freed quantity is sdieduled to be available widiin the ATF duration, the freed quantity can be used for satisfying ord^s related to the same member it^n (as the member itraa of flie unsdieduled ord^).<br>
When an unsdieduled order is based on quantities in both pre and post ATF point, the two different portions of quantities are treated diff^mtly. That is, tiie portion scheduled to be available within tiie ATF duration is first used to satisfy the dmiands related to the orders of the same mraiber item, and fbea the portion scheduled to be available after the ATF duration is used to satisfy the d^nands related to die ord^^ of any monber item.<br>
For illustration, it is assumed that an ordo* with a required quantity of SO units of monber-A and a requested day of d£Qr 7 (i.e., afto* ATF duration) is un-sdieduled when the status is as in Figure 10. Of the SO units, 40 units are allocated from frunily availability and 10 units are allocated from membff-A itoi availability as desoibed above with reference to Figure 8.<br>
The table of Figure 11 contains die status of the table afto* un-scheduling the request. Only the differences of table 1100 (of Figure 11) from table 1000 is described for concisraess. First the modifications corresponding to fanuiy are described then the modifications corresponding to item-A is described.<br>
Thus, the 10 units are first processed and indicated to be available, as depicted in row<br><br>
1189. The 40 units are used to satisfy the unmet draiand of 15 units indicated within brackets in row 1071 on d^ 8. The remaining 25 units are indicated as being available. If the unmet demand exceeds Ae available units, some priority ord«- (e.g., based on the committed date) may be used to allocate the available units.<br>
The feniity bucketed allocation (of row 1171) on day 7 is decrraiented by 40 resulting in 0 allocation on day 7, and item-A bucketed allocation (of row 1182) on day 5 is deo-emmted by 10 resulting in iton-A budceted detnand equaling 0. The net family available (of row 1172) on day 7 is equal to 20 (&amp;mily siq)ply (equal to 20) less family budceted allocation (equal to 0) corresponding to day 7).<br>
Net+backward consun^on (of row 1174) on day 6 is equal to 20 (adding correq)onding values of row 1172 and 1173) as badcward consumption (of row 1173) for day 6 equals 0 (as the allocated 40 units on d£iy 7 is now equal to z»x&gt; due to 50 units of member iton-A unsdieduled on d^ 7). Similarly, Netfbadcward consumption for day 7 and 8 res9)ectively equals 5 and 0 as badcward consunqrtion (of row 1173) for day 7 equals +15 (as 15 units available on day 7 are consumed by unmet demand of 15 on day 8) and that of day 8 equals +15 (as 15 units are consumed from day 7).<br>
Forward consumption (of row 1175) on day 8 equals 0, indicates Aat no supply from a friture d^ is consumed. Presmt family availability (of row 1180) on day 6 equals 20 (by adding correq&gt;onding values in row 1175 and 1178 on day 6). Similarly, present family availability on day 7 and 8 equals 5 and 0.<br>
Item-A demand (of row 1181) on day 7 is decr^nrated by 50 units due to an-sdieduling as noted above. It»n-A bucketed allocation (of row 1182) on day 5 is deonding values in row 1183 and 1184).<br><br>
Present item-A availability (of row 1188) on day 5 is equal to 10 (sum ot cone^Mnding values in row 1185 and 1186). TTie cumulative itan-A availability (of row 1189) on dfi^ 5 (wilhin ATF duration) is 30,and on days 6,7 and 8 (after ATF duration) is req)ectively equal to 50,55, and 55 and cumulative it«n-B availability (of row 1199) on days 6,7 and 8 (aStia ATF duration) is respectively equal to 20,25, and 25.<br>
