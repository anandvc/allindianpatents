The present invention relates to novel fatty acid analogues. Further, the invention relates to the use of the novel fatty acid analogues for the treatment and/or prevention of syndrome X, obesity, hypertension, fatty liver, diabetes, hyperglycaeinia, hyperinsulinemia and stenosis. The invention also relates to processes for the preparation of the novel fatty acid analogues.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
EP 345-038 describes the use of non-p-oxidizable fatty acid analogues of the formula;<br>
Alkyl-X-CH2C00R<br>
wherein the alkyl is a saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon chain of 8 to 22 carbon atoms, X represents a 0, S, SO or S02, and R is hydrogen or a CI ™ 04 alkyl group, for the treatment of hyperlipaemic conditions and for the reducing the concentration of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood of mammals.<br>
WO 97/03663  describes alkyl-S-CH2C00R and alkyl-Se-CH2COOR for the inhibition of the oxidative modification of<br>
LDL. Further, this application describes the use of the selenium-compound for the treatment of hyperlipaemic condition and for reducing the concentration of cholesterol and triglycerides*<br><br>
The   PCT publications WO 99/58121, WO 99/58122 and WO 99/58123<br>
describe  fatty acid analogues of the formula (I)<br><br>
-	wherein n  is an integer from 1 to 12, and<br>
-	wherein m  is  an integer from 0 to 23, and<br>
-	wherein i  is an odd number which indicates the position relative to COOR, and<br>
-	wherein X’ independent of each other are selected<br>
from the group comprising 0, S, SO, SO2/ Se and CH2/<br>
and<br>
-	wherein R represents hydrogen or Chi’s’ alkyl,<br>
-	with the proviso that at least one of the X’ is not<br>
CH2,<br>
or a salt, prodrug or complex thereof.<br>
This formula comprises one or several X groups (preferably selenium and sulphur) in positions 3, 5, 7, 9, etc-<br>
Further, these PCT  publications   describe several medicinal and nutritional applications.<br>
WO 99/58121 describes the use of the fatty acid analogues the treatment and/or prevention of obesity, hypertension, fatty liver and the multi metabolic syndrome termed «metabolic syndrome» or Syndrome X, Further, this application describes a method for the treatment or prevention of an obese or overweight condition, and a method for producing weigh loss or a reduction of the fat mass in a human or non-human animal- The application -also describes a nutritional composition effective to reduce, or<br><br>
to prevent an increase in, the total body weight or the total body fat mass in a human or non-human animal, and also a method for the modification of the fat distribution and content of animals in order to improve the quality of the meat, or product such as milk and eggs.<br>
WO 99/58122  describes use of fatty acid analogues for the treatment and/or prevention of diabetes (both type I and II), and a method for the treatment or prevention of hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinemia and reduced sensitivity to insulin. A nutritional composition effective to reduce, or to prevent an increase in the concentration of glucose in the blood of a human or non-human animal is also disclosed, as is a method for reducing the concentration of glucose in the blood of a human or non-human animal.<br>
WO 99/58123  describes the use of the fatty acid analogues for the treatment and/or prevention of primary and/or secondary stenosis, and/or a disease caused by procedural vascular trauma and/or pathological proliferation of smooth muscle cells, and/or an increased level of plasma Homocysteine.<br>
Due to the X-atom (most preferable sulphur or selenium) that is substituted in the carbon chain of the above given fatty acid analogues, these compounds will not be ii-oxidized in the mitochondria beyond this position. Thus, the degradation of these molecules must start from the methyl end of the fatty acid, and this is a rather slow metabolic process. The catabolism of these fatty acid analogues includes co-oxidation and chain shortening of the dicarboxylic acid by peroxisomes. Enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum will u-hydroxylate and further oxidise the hydroxylase fatty acid to a dicarboxylic acid.<br><br>
This acid may then be chain shortened by li-oxidation in the peroxisomes. Studies in rats have shown that 50% of the analogue TTA was excreted in the urine SiS  short sulfoxy dicarboxylic acids within 24 hours of administration. In similar experiments it has been found that a desaturated product of TTA is formed in vivo. This is due to the<br>
microsomal enzyme A’-desaturated which inserts a double bond in the 9-position of saturated fatty acids.<br>
It is anticipated that this desaturated product has similar effects, and/or mediates the biological effects of the saturated fatty acid analogues. It is also likely that the biological effects of fatty acid analogues may be potentiated by slowing down their catabolism. This can be done by inserting double and/or triple bonds near the methyl end of the fatty acids, and/or by incorporating alkyl groups or halogens in this part of the molecule- Such molecules, i-e- the compounds in-accordance with the present invention, will not be substrates for the relevant microsomal enzymes-<br>
OBESITY, AND RELATED DISEASES<br>
Obesity is a chronic disease that is highly prevalent in modern society and is associated not only with a social stigma, but also with decreased life span and numerous medical problems, including adverse psychological development, reproductive disorders such as polycystic ovarian disease, dermatological disorders such as infections, varicose veins. Acanthosis Nigerians, and eczema, exercise intolerance, diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, cholelithiasis, osteoarthritis, orthopedic injury, thromboembolic disease, cancer, and coronary heart disease.<br><br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a treatment regimen that is useful in returning the body weight of obese subjects toward a normal, ideal body weight*<br>
It is another object to provide a therapy for obesity that results in maintenance of the lowered body weight for an extended period of time. Further, it is an object to reduce or inhibit the weight gain normally induced by fat rich diets.<br>
It is yet another object to prevent obesity and, once treatment has begun, to arrest progression or prevent the onset of diseases that are the consequence of, or secondary to, the obesity, such as hypertension and fatty liver. These and other objects will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art-<br>
The obesity herein may be due to any cause, whether genetic or environmental. Examples of disorders that may result in obesity or be the cause of obesity include overeating and bulimia, polycystic ovarian disease, craniopharyngioma, the Prader-Willi Syndrome, Frolic’s syndrome, Type II diabetics, GH-deficient subjects, normal variant short stature, Turner's syndrome, and other pathological conditions showing reduced metabolic activity.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide a treatment regimen that is useful in lowering the blood pressure.<br>
Further, it is an object of the present invention to provide a treatment regimen that is useful in lowering the<br><br>
concentration of triacylglycerols in the liver- It is anticipated that such a regimen will provide an inhibiting effect on the development of a fatty liver condition, and also be suited as a method for the treatment of the manifested disease.<br>
The compounds of the present invention activate the p-oxidation, and also reduce the concentration of triglycerieds in the liver.<br>
The term ‘""metabolic syndrome" is used to describe a multi-metabolic syndrome which is ii3ter alia  characterized by hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, obesity, glucose intolerance, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia or hypertension.<br>
As indicated above it is anticipated that the compounds of the present invention will provide a positive effect on all the conditions mentioned above, i.e. by regulating both the glucose and lipid homeostasis, and thus it is anticipated that the compounds of the present invention will be suitable agents for the regulation of the above defined metabolic disease (sometimes called syndrome X)•<br>
DIABETES<br>
There are two major forms of diabetes mellitus. One is type I diabetes, which is also known as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) , and the other is type II diabetes, which is also known as noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) . Most patients with IDDM have a common pathological picture; the nearly total disappearance of insulin’producing pancreatic beta cells which results in hyperglycemia•<br><br>
Considerable evidence has been accumulated showing that most IDDM is the consequence of progressive beta-cell destruction during an asymptomatic period often extending over many years. The prediabetic period can be recognized by the detection of circulating islet-cell autoantibodies and insulin autoantibodies.<br>
There is a need for a compound which would be nontoxic and have no side effects but which would prevent clinical IDDM and NIDDM.<br>
Type I diabetes: severe diabetes mellitus, usually of abrupt onset prior to maturity, characterized by low plasma insulin levels, polydipsia, polyuria, increased appetite, weight loss and episodic ketoacidosis; also referred to as IDDM.<br>
Type II diabetes: an often mild form of diabetes mellitus, often of gradual onset, usually in adults, characterized by normal to high absolute plasma insulin levels which are relatively low in relation to plasma glucose levels; also referred to as NIDDM.<br>
Type I and II diabetes are in accordance with an etiologic classification considered as «primary» diabetes respectively.<br>
Secondary diabetes comprises pancreatic, extrapancreatic/ endocrine or drug-induced diabetes. Further, some types of diabetes are classified as exceptional forms. These include lipoatrophic, myatonic diabetesr and a type of diabetes caused by disturbance of insulin receptors.<br><br>
Considering the high prevalence of diabetes in our society and the serious consequences associated therewith as discussed above, any therapeutic drug potentially useful for the treatment and prevention of this disease could have a profound beneficial effect on their health. There is a need in the art for a drug that will reduce the concentration of glucose in the blood of diabetic subjects without significant adverse side effects.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a treatment regimen that is useful in lowering the blood glucose and to treat a diabetic condition.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to provide a treatment regimen that is useful in lowering the concentration of insulin in the blood, and to increase the effect of the remaining insulin.<br>
STENOSIS<br>
Many pathological conditions have been found to be associated with smooth muscle cell proliferation. Such conditions include restenosis, arteriosclerosis, coronary heart disease, thrombosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, smooth muscle neoplasms such as leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma of the bowel and uterus and uterine fibroid or fibroma.<br>
Over half a million interventional intravascular procedures are performed each year. While such invasive procedures continue to improve over time, as many as 30-50% of the procedures performed each year fail as a result of restenosis, i.e. the formation of secondary stenosis. The reduction of restenosis is, therefore, often cited as the<br><br>
most critical factor in increasing the success realised in the treatment of cardiovascular disease through the use of interventional intravascular procedures/ such as angioplasty, atherectomy, and procedures utilising stents and laser technology-<br>
In balloon angioplasty’ e.g. Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA), a small incision is made to an artery in the patient's leg or arm and a long hollow tube, called a guide catheter, is inserted into the artery. A thick guide wire and deflated balloon catheter are then inserted into the guide catheter and are carefully advanced through the patient's blood vessels using x-ray visualization- The deflated balloon is advanced until it reaches the site of the luminal narrowing, at which point the physician inflates the balloon one or more times to a pressure of about 4-6 atm for about 60 sec. When inflated, the balloon cracks and fractures the plaque and stretches the muscle fibre in the artery wall beyond its ability to recoil completely. Although no plaque is removed in this procedure, the fracturing of the plaque and the stretching of the arterial wall increase the vessel lumen, thereby allowing for increased blood flow-<br>
The restenosis that accompanies such procedures is characterised by platelet aggregation and adhesion, smooth muscle cell proliferation, narrowing of the vessel lumen, restricted vasodilatation, and an increase in blood pressure- Smooth muscle cells in the intimal layer of the artery have been reported to enter the growth cycle within about 2-3 days of these procedures and to proliferate for several days thereafter (intimal hyperplasia) .<br>
Compounds that reportedly suppress smooth muscle prolife-<br><br>
ration in vitro may have undesirable pharmacological side effects when used in vivo- Heparin is an example of one such compound, which reportedly inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation in vitro but when used in vivo has the potential adverse side effect of inhibiting coagulation.<br>
hs  is apparent from the foregoing, many problems remain to be solved in the use of inhibitory drugs to effectively treat smooth muscle ceil mobilisation and proliferation. It would be highly advantageous to develop new compositions or methods for inhibiting stenosis, restenosis or related disorders due to proliferation and mobilisation of vascular smooth muscle cells following, for example, traumatic injury to vessels rendered during vascular surgery.<br>
It is anticipated that the compounds in accordance with the present invention will be effectively it the treatment of these diseases -<br>

They can be administered locally or systemically* The specific route of administration of each agent will depend, e,g,, on the medical history of the animal.<br>
The invention will be more fully understood by reference to the following examples- They should not, however, be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.<br><br>
EXPERIMENTAL SECTION<br>
METHODS<br>
The methods described below were used as test systems for the compounds described in the prior art, and are thus also be used to test the biological effects of the present compounds.<br>
Obese Zucker (fa/fa) rats.<br>
The obese Zucker (fa/fa) rats used in this study were bred at the U 465 INSERM animal facility from pairs originally provided by the Harriet G. Bird Laboratory (Stow, MA, USA) , Unless otherwise stated, the animals were maintained under a constant light-dark cycle (light from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m,) at 21±1 C° and were given free access to food and water. Three rats were housed per cage. Weight gains were recorded daily,<br>
Wistar rats<br>
Male Wistar Charles River rats weighing 280-358 were purchased from AnLab Ltd- (Prague, Czech Repubic) and housed in wire-mesh cages in a temperature (22±1 'C) and light-controlled (light from 7.00 a,m. to 7,00 p.m.) room. They were given free access to chow and water. Three rats were housed per cage. Weight gain and food intake were recorded daily.<br>
Intravenous glucose tolerance tests<br>
		I ‘‘IIMI» 11 I	-'\	II _	 ]	-■ II       l.ll’   11     I II    M II I	M    111...	I  1’’’.<br>
Male Zucker (fa/fa) rats (5 weeks old) were anaesthetised after a 5-hours fast, by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg). The rats were injected with glucose (0*55 g/kg) in the saphenous vein and blood samples were collected from the tail vein in heparinized<br><br>
tubes at time 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 minutes after the glucose load. Samples were kept on ice, centrifuged and plasma was stored at ‘20 °C until analysis.<br>
Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp.<br>
After 21 days on their respective diets (see above), the rats were anaesthetised by injection of xylazine hydrochloride (Rometar SPOFA, Prague, Czech Republic; 10 mg/ml) and  ketamine hydrochloride (Narkamon SPOFA, Prague, Czech republic; 75 mg/ml), and fitted with chronic carotid artery and jugular vein cannulas as described by Koopmans et al, (Koopmans, S.J., et al., Biochim Biophys Acta, 1115, 2130-2138 1992.), The cannulated rats were allowed to recover for two days after surgery before the clamping studies which were carried out according to Kraegen et al. (Kraegen, E. W., et al.. Am J Physiol, 248, E353-E362 1983.)- Thus, on the third day after surgery, unrestrained conscious rats were given a continuous infusion of porcine insulin (Actrapid, Novo Nordisk, Denmark) at a dose of 6.4 mU per kg per min to achieve plasma insulin levels in the upper physiological range. The arterial blood glucose concentration was clamped at the basal fasting level, by variable infusion of a 30 % w/v glucose solution (Leciva, Prague, Czech Republic). Blood samples for determination of plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were obtained every 15 minutes from the start of the glucose infusion. After 90 minutes, the rats were disconnected from the infusions and immediately decapitated, blood was collected for plasma separation, liver and epididymal adipose tissue pads were dissected out and weighed.<br>
Measurement of plasma parameters<br>
Glucose (GLU, Boehringer Mannheim, Germany), free fatty<br>
acids (NEFA, C ACS-ACOD kit; Wako Chemicals, Dalton, USA)<br><br>
and b"hydroxybutyrate (310-A kit; Sigma Diagnostics Inc., St. Louis, USA) concentrations were measured using enzymatic methods. Insulin concentrations were determined with radioimmunoassay by (CIS bio International, Gif sur Yvette, France) using rat insulin as standard in the Zucker rats. In the Wistar Charles River rats, plasma glucose concentrations were measured with the aid of Beckman Glucose Analyzer (Fullerton, CA, USA), Plasma insulin levels were measured using a RIA kit from Linco Research Inc. (St. Charles, MO, USA). Phospholipids were measured by the enzymatic method of bioMerieux, Marcy-1'Etoile, France, Triacylglycerol by the Technicon Method no. SA4-0324L90, USA and Cholesterol by the Technicon Method no. SA4" 0305L90, USA.<br>
Preparation of post-nuclear and mitochondrial fractions and measurement of enzyme activities<br>
Freshly isolated livers from individual old Zucker rats, were homogenised in ice-’cold sucrose buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) and 2 mM EDTA). Post-nuclear and mitochondrial fractions were prepared using preparative differential centrifugation according to DeDuve et al,   (De Duve, C, et al., Biochem. J., 60, 604-617 1955.) Modifications, purity and yield were as described earlier (Garras, A., et al., Biochim. Biophys, Acta, 1255, 154-160 1995.). Acid soluble products were measured in post-nuclear<br>
and mitochondrial enriched fractions, using [1-l’C]-<br>
palmitoyl-CoA and [l-’’C]-palmitoyl-L-carnitine (Radiochemical Centre, Amersham, England) as substrates as described earlier (Willumsen, N., et al., J. Lipid Res., 34, 13-22 1993. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I and -II activities were measured in the post’nuclear and mitochondrial fractions essentially as described by Bremer (Bremer, J., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 665, 628-631 1981.)<br><br>
and S'-hydroxy-S-methylglutharyl-CoA synthase was measured according to Clinkenbeard et al. (Clinkenbeard, K. D., et al., J. Biol, Chem, 250, 3108-3116 1975.) in the mitochondrial fractions -<br>
RNA analysis<br>
RNA extraction (Chomczynski, P., et al». Anal. Biochem,, 162; 156-159 1987.). Northern blot analysis and slot blotting of RNA onto nylon filters, and hybridisation to immobilised RNA were performed as earlier described (Vaagenes, H*, et al., Biochem, Pharmacol-, 56, 1571-1582 1998,) - The following cDNA fragments were used as probes: CPT-I, (Esser, V, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 268,5817-5822 1993), CPT-II (Woeltje, K. F., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 265, 10720-10725 1990,) , 3-"hydroxy-3-methylglutharyl-CoA<br>
synthase (Ayte, J., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,, 87, 3874-3878 1990.), and hormone sensitive lipase (Holm, C*, et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1006, 193-197 1989.). The relative levels of RNA expression were estimated as the amounts of radioactive probe hybridised to the respective levels of 28S rRNA.<br>
