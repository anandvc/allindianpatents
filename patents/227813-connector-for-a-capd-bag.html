				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION :<br>
The present invention relates to a connector for which CAPD ( Continuous Ambulatory<br>
Peritoneal Dialysis ) Bag system enabling the patients who are on ambulatory<br>
peritoneal dialysis system to make connection and disconnection with a minimum risk<br>
of infection to the patient.<br>
More particularly the invention relates to connector attached to Y connector for use<br>
with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis devices which prevents contamination<br>
during connection or disconnection process of the connector to the transfer bag.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION :<br>
Y	tubing is commonly focused in medical devices such as stethoscope, drain tubing,<br>
intravenous sets, vacuum manifolds and the like. The Y tubing generally have three<br>
tubular arms projecting from a common axis, each arm having an inner lumen, each<br>
inner lumen of other arms. Thus, the goal of dividing a single tube having a single<br>
lumen into two tubes having separate lumens is achieved. The assembly has three<br>
structurallyweak points where each of these separate tubes are attached to the arm of<br>
Y	adaptor. The assembled non unitary bifurcating tubing is vulnerable at these points.<br>
PRIOR ART:<br>
U.S. Patent no. 5945057 describes a unitary tubing having a unitary construction and<br>
an extension apparatus therefor. There are no joints to put apart Y connectors between<br>
the tubes which may be vulnerable to separation. Connectors of different types are<br>
well known in the art. There are many types of connectors. Connectors are actually a<br><br>
very vital part of the medical equipment. There are quite a few methods used for<br>
treating the patients who suffer with the loss of their kidney functions. In such patients<br><br>
the removal of toxic substances and metasblities exerted by the kidney is performed by<br>
dialysis. Normally in this medical process a container with the dialysate fluid is<br>
connected to a permanent abdominal tube and the dialysis fluid is allowed to flow into<br>
peritoneal cavity. The container and tubing are then wound around the waist and tied.<br>
The dialysate fluid is allowed to remain in the peritoneal cavity for a period of time<br>
allowing toxic waste and water to pass into the fluid. At the end of predetermined<br>
period of time the container is lowered and the fluid is allowed to flow out and back into<br>
the original container. The container is then disconnected and discarded and new<br>
container of diaJysate fluid attached to the permanent abdominal tube and the process<br>
is repeated.<br>
U.S. Patent no. 4810241 describes connectors for use with ambulatory devices. The<br>
connector is compressed of a cylinder containing a disinfecting solution which<br>
continuous bathes the male and female connector of a tube during use. A male<br>
connector is inserted into the female connector through the cylinder containing the<br>
absorbent material saturated with the disinfectant. Once the dialysate fluid is delivered<br>
to patient through connector, the tube is pulled off the outer end of male connector to<br>
remove empty container.<br><br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION :<br>
In Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis the process of dialysis is accomplished<br>
by a percutaneous or surgical implantation of a catheter in the patients abdomen. The<br>
CAPD system is connected to the catheter through the transfer set. The peritoneal<br>
cavity is initially emptied by removal of peritoneal fluid into the drainage bag. After that<br>
CAPD solution is infused into it. After the infusion the CAPD system is disconnected<br>
from the transfer set. The dialysate (CAPD solution) stays for 4-5 hours in peritoneal<br>
cavity (dwell time). During this dwell time toxic substances and metabolities are<br>
transferred to dialysate by ultra filteration through peritoneal membrane. This entire<br>
process constitutes an Exchange Procedure.<br>
During the Exchange Process a frequent problem which occurs is the danger of<br>
peritoneal infection or peritonitus. Problem with the conventional connectors which are<br>
used in the exchange process is that being asymetric the alignment is not maintained<br>
by repeated connections and disconnections. Also these connectors are not safe as<br>
there could be leakage at the injection point resulting into a serious infection to the<br>
patient. The other most serious disadvantage in the existing bag is touching the<br>
connector with hand thus creating an infection.<br>
Therefore, there always existed a need to provide a connector for use in the Exchange<br>
Process of Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis which can remove the existing<br>
drawbacks.<br><br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a connector for patient using<br>
continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Another object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a connector between the dialysis devices and the transfer set. It is yet another<br>
object of the present invention is to provide a connector which is novel and safe for use<br>
in the Exchange Procedure.<br>
Other object of the present invention is to provide a connector which covers the entire<br>
threading of the transfer set so that the hands do not touch the threading of transfer set<br>
which could result in contamination.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a connector with a cap having<br>
a handle which is easy to operate and eliminates chances of contamination of<br>
connector.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a connector in which the hole<br>
of the central tube of the connector is tapered to give uniform flow of dialysate.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a connector in which the alignment of the<br>
screws to be fitted on the transfer set is maintained throughout the Exchange<br>
Procedure.<br>
The present invention allows the connection and disconnection of the transfer set<br>
during the Exhchange Procedure which minimizes the possibility of contamination by<br><br>
human hands. In the invention the connector has a cylindrical hood to cover the entire<br>
threading of transfer set. The hood is capped with latex cap provided with a handle.<br>
The cap can be removed by pulling the handle out of the connector. The hole of the<br>
central tube of connector is tapered and the connector is made out of transparent<br>
plastic. The connector disc is supported by 4 ribs to keep the alignment of the screw to<br>
be fitted on transfer set fully aligned to eliminate leakage.<br>
According to the present invention, a connector for use in a Continuous Peritoneal<br>
Dialysis system comprises a cylindrical hood for covering the entire threading of a<br>
transfer set, to eliminate touching the threaded portion of the transfer set during<br>
exchange process a cylindrical hood to cover the entire threading of transfer set,<br>
means to cover the cylendrical hood, means to pull out the covering means from the<br>
covering hood central hole with tapering provided in the central tube for the smooth<br>
flow of the incoming dialysate in peritoneal dialysis fluid, means for keeping the<br>
alignment of the screw to be fitted on the transfer set fully aligned to eliminate leakage.<br>
The other embodiment of the invention resides in that the connector is made of<br>
transparent plastic preferably polycarbonate to render clear visibiliity of fittings in the<br>
transfer set as well as movement of the solution.<br><br>
In short the developed connector has the main sailent features :-<br>
	The connector has a cylindrical hood to cover the entire threading of transfer<br>
set. During connection or disconnection process of the connector to the<br>
transfer bag, the hand does not touch the threaded portion of the transfer set<br>
which shall result into contamination during exchange process<br>
	The cylindrcal hood is capped with a medical grade latex cap provided with a<br>
special handle. The design of the cap is such that by holding the end of the<br>
handle and by pulling the same out of the connector to uncap the chance of<br>
any touch to the connector hood are eliminated which results in to elimination of<br>
contamination of the connector, resulting into elimination of infection to the<br>
patient,<br>
	The hole in the central tube of the connector is tapered to give uniform<br>
smooth flow of the incoming dialysate, i.e. Peritoneal Dialysis fluid. This<br>
results into the patient feeling more comfort when the dialysate is being<br>
infused in the peritoneal cavity.<br>
	The connector disc is supported by 4 ribs at an angle of 90° to each other<br>
to keep the alignment of the screw to be fitted on transfer set fully aligned<br>
to eliminate lekage.<br>
	The connector is made out of transparent plastic i.e. polycarbonate through<br>
which there is a clear visibility of appropriate fitting on to the transfer set as<br>
well as movement of the solution.<br>
The above invention will become more apparent when considered in the light of the<br>
following accompanying drawings :-<br><br>
