The invention relates to a spinning frame, a ring spinning frame in particular according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
It is known to provide a traveller cleaner on a ring rail of a ring spinning frame in order to strip-off fibre waste and other foreign particles (DE-B1 16 85 898) during spinning operation. The traveller cleaner follows basically parallel to the shape of the outer profile of the spinning ring. It is designed like a cutting edge which is positioned vertically and which separates fibres adhering on the traveller. It did show, however, that lose fibre fly caught by the spinning balloon can still cause wrapping of the traveller, which can lead up to a collapse of the balloon and thread breakage.<br>
It is the object of the invention to provide a spinning frame of the above mentioned type where not only the traveller is being completely and reliably cleaned but where wrapping is avoided efficiently.<br>
Said task is solved by providing a traveller cleaner with the characteristic features according to claim 1. The depending claims relate to preferred further embodiments.<br>
The idea of the invention is thus to be seen in the feature, in that a line-shaped, particularly partially straight-lined stripping edge on the cleaning blade co-operates preferably with a catching edge following the stripping edge immediately and which is positioned at the right angle in relation to the yarn running direction. Preferably, at height of the spinning ring with the traveller, only the stripping edge is being provided, while the catching edge only follows on a level preferably immediately above the traveller.<br>
This way, by the traveller cleaner according to the invention, not only the contamination on the traveller is removed<br><br>
effectively and completely but also the fibre fly collecting on the yarn is stopped and removed effectively by a catching edge before it reaches the traveller* By means of the catching edge it is also possible to remove fibres projecting from the yarn and which are not being fully integrated in the yarn.<br>
Thus the object of the invention is to eliminate effectively foreign particles and contamination on the yarn as well as on the traveller at a very specific position, that is, seen in running yarn direction at the end of the balloon.<br>
By means of this optimised cleaning not only thread breakages are prevented but also the quality of the produced yarn is being improved by way of the combined cleaning measures according to the invention.<br>
Preferred further embodiments of the invention are characterised by the features of the sub-claims.<br>
Preferable is furthermore the embodiment according to claim 7 since there an angle results between the catching edge and the stripping edge which enhances the overall cleaning effect.<br>
Preferable parameters are specified in claims 8 to 13.<br>
The invention is being described hereafter according to the exemplified embodiment of the accompanying drawing; wherein shows<br>
figure 1    a partial cross sectional view of a traveller<br>
cleaner, together with the spinning ring part bordering radially from the inside, shown in a meridian cross sectional view, by way of an example with a slanted-flange-type spinning ring;<br>
figure 2 a,b,c as well as figure 3a,b,c,<br><br>
views in circumferential direction and in radial direction of the spinning ring, with the essential dimensions of the traveller cleaner;<br>
figure 4    views of a traveller cleaner for a T-flange-type<br>
spinning ring;<br>
figure 5    a top view of a traveller cleaner; and<br>
figure 6, 7 further embodiments for various spinning ring/<br>
traveller combinations.<br>
According to figure 1 a concentric cone-shaped spinning ring 11 with an axis 17 as well as with a top 11' is being arranged on the holder 19. On said spinning ring 11, there is, in the known manner, a traveller 12 being arranged which is movable in circumferential direction. Radially towards the outside the traveller 12 is formed around the top 11' at such a distance that a gap is formed through which the yarn 21 can be led.<br>
Radially outside, the traveller 12 transforms into a basically straight outer zone 12' running basically parallel to the radial cross section of the spinning ring 11.<br>
Radially outside the spinning ring 11 there is a cleaning blade 13 being fastened directly or indirectly on the holder 19 in such a way in that a straight-lined stripping edge 14 of said cleaning blade faces at a slight distance the straight section 12' of the traveller 12, at the time while the traveller 12 is just in the circumferential position being shown in figure 1.<br>
Above the straight-line stripping edge 14 there is a catching edge 15. Both can lay on the same plane.<br>
According to figure 2 the traveller cleaner 13 can be formed as a rigid plate with edges 14, 15.<br><br>
According to figure 1, towards the running direction of the yarn, the spinning ring 11 has the shape of a tapered cone, whereat the cone angle a amounts for example to 33Â°. The same angle is also included between the stripping edge 14 and the surface of the holder 19.<br>
The stripping edge 15' being basically parallel to the yarn 21 possesses a good cleaning function, however, with that type of embodiment the yarn 21 can remain for a longer time at the stripping edge 15'.<br>
The catching edge 15 begins above the uppermost level of the traveller 12. It includes an angle 5 with the vertical as is shown according to figure 2a and is positioned basically at right angle in relation to the running direction of the yarn 21, shortly before the point where the yarn is being redirected through the traveller 12 into a horizontal direction. The catching edge 15 effects that fly or protruding fibres adhering to the yarn 21 are being separated, knocked off respectively from the yarn 21 before they reach the traveller 12.<br>
The stripping edge 14 is spaced from the spinning ring, at a distance g, g' respectively. The transitional edge K between the stripping edge 14 and the catching edge 15 lays above the upper edge of the spinning ring 11 by the measurement h.<br>
The lengths of the stripping edge, catching edge respectively 14, 15, are indicated with b and c. The base 16 has a support surface A. It includes an angle fi with the stripping edge 14.<br>
The width d of the traveller cleaner 13 can be decreased continuously to the measurement e in upward direction.<br>
The values of the parameters of the arrangement shown in figure 1 and 2 are as follows:<br>
Thickness s of the cleaning blade 13<br><br>
within the area	of the edges 14, 15:   0,6 mm  (0,1 to 1 mm)<br>
distance g:	1,6 mm  (1,5 to 2,5 mm)<br>
distance g' :	0,5 mm  (0,4 to 1,4 mm)<br>
length c:	4 to 10 mm<br>
width d, e respectively	(6 to 12 mm)<br>
Â£	57Â°          (50 to 75Â°)<br>
5:	72Â°          (60 to 85Â°)<br>
h:	3 mm        (1 to 6 mm)<br>
The above values without brackets are being	preferred while<br>
those being indicated in brackets specify a	range within which<br>
a satisfactory functioning of the traveller	cleaner 13 is being<br>
reached.<br>
As is shown in the figures the catching edge 15 is strongly bent in relation to the stripping edge 14, The best results are being achieved with a traveller cleaner 13 which is shown in full line in figure 1, together with a so-called slanted-flange type spinning ring. The embodiment according to figure 4 is provided for a T-flange type spinning ring. The stripping edge is vertical and the catching edge is bent at an angle of 45Â° towards the outside. The profile of a respective spinning ring is shown in chain-dotted line.<br>
In the figures 2a, b, c up to 4a, b, c the various types of embodiments of traveller cleaners are shown. As can be seen from figures 2b, c, 3b, c, 4b, c the traveller cleaner 13 is of plate-shape and it is preferably bent, made of a sheet metal strip. In said case the traveller cleaner 13 is furnished with a stripping edge 14 and a catching edge 15 on each longitudinal side. According to figures 2c, 3c, 4c the traveller cleaner 13 can be made narrower in upward direction.<br>
The function of the described arrangement is as follows:<br>
During its rotation on the spinning ring 11 the traveller 12 passes once at each turn the stripping edge 14, whereat<br><br>
possible fibre parts adhering on the traveller are being removed, knocked off respectively by the mechanical contact enacted in the zone of the stripping edge 14,<br>
Above the traveller 12 the yarn 21 passes near the catching edge 15 once during each turn of the traveller 12, so that fibres protecting from the yarn 21 or contamination clinging to it are being caught and removed.<br>
According to figure 5 the traveller cleaner 13 can be of arc-shaped configuration within the zone of the stripping edge 14 and/or the catching edge 15, in order to prevent a back-up of the air streaming past.<br>
Generally the traveller cleaner is preferably arranged symmetrically in relation to the centre axis A, so that for both rotational directions Rl, R2 of the spindles of the spinning frame (S- or Z- twist) the same conditions prevail.<br>
The above description is based on the general knowledge of the specialist of figure 1. It is understood that with the term ^vertical" a direction parallel to the axis 17 of the spinning ring is meant. The axis of the spinning ring is preferably arranged vertically, however, it can also be arranged in a ring spinning frame in a position different from the vertical one.<br>
With the embodiment of the traveller cleaner 13 according to figure 6 or 7, loosely deposited fibre fly can be removed even more efficiently, than with those embodiments according to figure 2a and 4a. The stripping edge 14 is being furnished with a radially outward directed bend, thereby forming an upper portion 14a and a lower portion 14b, which portion include an<br>
angle 8 and C,  respectively, to the vertical.<br>
The following value range is considered favourable, whereat the underlined value is preferred:<br><br>
