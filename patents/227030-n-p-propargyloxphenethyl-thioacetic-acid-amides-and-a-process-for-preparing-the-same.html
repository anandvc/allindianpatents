The presence of at least one asymmetric carbon atom in the compounds of formula I means that the compounds may occur in optically isomeric and enantiomeric forms.

The compounds of formula I are oils or solids at room temperature and are distinguished by valuable microbiocidal properties. They can be used in the agR1cultural sector or related fields preventatively and curatively in the control of plant-destructive microorganisms. The compounds of formula I according to the invention are distinguished at low rates of concentration not only by outstanding microbiocidal, especially fungicidal, activity but also by being especially well tolerated by plants.<br>
SurpR1singly, it has now been found that the compounds of formula I have for practical purposes a very advantageous microbiocidal spectrum in the control of phytopathogenic microorganisms, especially fungi. They possess very advantageous curative and preventative properties and are used in the protection of numerous crop plants. With the compounds of formula I it is possible to inhibit or destroy phytopathogenic microorganisms that occur on vaR1ous crops of useful plants or on parts of such plants (fruit, blossom, leaves, stems, tubers, roots), while parts of the plants which grow later also remain protected, for example, against phytopathogenic fungi.<br>
The novel compounds of formula I prove to be effective against specific genera of the fungus class Fungi imperfecti (e.g. Cercospora), Basidiomycetes (e.g. Puccinia) and Ascomycetes (e.g. Erysiphe and VentuR1a) and especially against Oomycetes (e.g. Plasmopara, Peronospora, Pythium and Phytophthora). They therefore represent in plant protection a valuable addition to the compositions for controlling phytopathogenic fungi. The compounds of formula I can also be used as dressings for protecting seed (fruit, tubers, grains) and plant cuttings from fungal infections and against phytopathogenic fungi that occur in the soil.<br><br>
The invention relates also to compositions compR1sing compounds of formula I as active ingredient, especially plant-protecting compositions, and to the use thereof in the agR1cultural sector or related fields.<br>
In addition, the present invention includes the preparation of those compositions, wherein the active ingredient is homogeneously mixed with one or more of the substances or groups of substances descR1bed herein. Also included is a method of treating plants which is distinguished by the application of the novel compounds of formula I or of the novel compositions.<br>
Target crops to be protected within the scope of this invention compR1se, for example, the following species of plants: cereals (wheat, barley, rye, oats, R1ce, maize, sorghum and related species); beet (sugar beet and fodder beet); pomes, stone fruit and soft fruit (apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherR1es, strawberR1es, raspberR1es and blackberR1es); leguminous plants (beans, lentils, peas, soybeans); oil plants (rape, mustard, poppy, olives, sunflowers, coconut, castor oil plants, cocoa beans, groundnuts); cucurbi-taceae (marrows, cucumbers, melons); fibre plants (cotton, flax, hemp, jute); citrus fruit (oranges, lemons, grapefruit, mandaR1ns); vegetables (spinach, lettuce, asparagus, cabbages, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes, papR1ka); lauraceae (avocado, cinnamon, camphor) and plants such as tobacco, nuts, coffee, sugar cane, tea, pepper, vines, hops, bananas and natural rubber plants, and also ornamentals.<br>
The compounds of formula I are normally used in the form of compositions and can be applied to the area or plant to be treated simultaneously or in succession with other active ingredients. Those other active ingredients may be fertilizers, micronutR1ent donors or other preparations that influence plant growth. It is also possible to use selective herbicides or insecticides, fungicides, bacteR1cides, nematicides, molluscicides or mixtures of several of those preparations, if desired together with further carR1ers, surfactants or other application-promoting adjuvants customaR1ly employed in formulation technology.<br>
The compounds of formula I can be mixed with other fungicides, resulting in some cases in unexpected synergistic activities. Such mixtures are not limited to two active ingredients (one of formula I and one of the list of other fungicides), but to the contrary many compR1se more than one active ingredient of the component of formula I and more than one other<br><br>

Biological Examples<br>
D-1: Action against Plasmopara viticola on vines<br>
a)	Residual-protective action<br>
Vine seedlings are sprayed at the 4- to 5-leaf stage with a spray mixture (0.02 % active ingredient) prepared from a wettable powder formulation of the test compound. After 24 hours, the treated plants are infected with a sporangia suspension of the fungus. Fungus infestation is evaluated after incubation for 6 days at 95-100 % relative humidity and +20°C.<br>
b)	Residual-curative action<br>
Vine seedlings are infected at the 4- to 5-leaf stage with a sporangia suspension of the fungus. After incubation for 24 hours in a humidity chamber at 95-100 % relative humidity and +20°C, the infected plants are dR1ed and sprayed with a spray mixture (0.02 % active ingredient) prepared from a wettable powder formulation of the test compound. After the spray coating has dR1ed, the treated plants are placed in the humidity chamber again. Fungus infestation is evaluated 6 days after infection.<br>
Compounds of Tables 1 to 41 exhibit a good fungicidal action against Plasmopara viticola on vines. Compounds A1.01, A1.02, A1.03, A1.05, A1.07, A2.01 and A2.02 at 200 ppm inhibit fungal infestations in this test by 80 % to 100 %. At the same time untreated plants showed pathogen attack of 80 % to 100 %.<br>
D-2: Action against Phvtophthora on tomato plants<br>
a)	Residual-protective action<br>
After a cultivation peR1od of 3 weeks, tomato plants are sprayed with a spray mixture (0.02 % active ingredient) prepared from a wettable powder formulation of the test compound. After 48 hours, the treated plants are infected with a sporangia suspension of the fungus. Fungus infestation is evaluated after incubation of the infected plants for 5 days at 90-100 % relative humidity and +20°C.<br>
b)	Systemic action<br>
After a cultivation peR1od of 3 weeks, tomato plants are watered with a spray mixture<br>
(0.02 % active ingredient based on the volume of the soil) prepared from a wettable powder<br>
formulation of the test compound. Care is taken that the spray mixture does not come into<br><br>
contact with the parts of the plants that are above the ground. After 96 hours, the treated plants are infected with a sporangia suspension of the fungus. Fungus infestation is evaluated after incubation of the infected plants for 4 days at 90-100 % relative humidity and +20X.<br>
Compounds of Tables 1 to 41 exhibit a long-lasting effect against fungus infestation. Compounds A1.01, A1.02, A1.03, A1.05, A1.07, A2.01 and A2.02 at 200 ppm inhibit fungal infestations in this test by 80 % to 100 %. At the same time untreated plants showed pathogen attack of 80 % to 100 %.<br>
D-3 : Action against Phytophthora on potato plants<br>
a)	Residual-protective action<br>
2-3 week old potato plants (Bintje vaR1ety) are sprayed with a spray mixture (0.02 % active ingredient) prepared from a wettable powder formulation of the test compound. After 48 hours, the treated plants are infected with a sporangia suspension of the fungus. Fungus infestation is evaluated after incubation of the infected plants for 4 days at 90-100 % relative humidity and +20°C.<br>
b)	Systemic action<br>
2-3 week old potato plants (Bintje vaR1ety) are watered with a spray mixture (0.02 % active ingredient based on the volume of the soil) prepared from a wettable powder formulation of the test compound. Care is taken that the spray mixture does not come into contact with the parts of the plants that are above the ground. After 48 hours, the treated plants are infected with a sporangia suspension of the fungus. Fungus infestation is evaluated after incubation of the infected plants for 4 days at 90-100 % relative humidity and +20°C. Compounds of Tables 1 to 41 exhibit a long-lasting effect against fungus infestation. Compounds A1.01, A1.02, A1.03, A1.04, A1.05, A1.06, A1.07, A2.01 and A2.02 at 200 ppm inhibit fungal infestations in this test by 80 % to 100 %. At the same time untreated plants showed pathogen attack of 80 % to 100 %.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
