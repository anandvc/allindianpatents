				<td>SINGLE POT CONVERSION OF ARTEMISININ INTO ARTEETHER<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an improved single pot method for preparation of<br>
Arteether from Artemisinin. Arteether prepared from the process is useful for the<br>
treatment of uncomplicated, severe complicated and multi drug resistant malaria.<br>
Background Art<br>
Approximately, out of the 4 billion people suffering from malaria, 1-3 million people,<br>
mostly children die every year worldwide. The rapidly spreading multidrug resistant<br>
parasite to standard quinoline based antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine and<br>
mefloquine based antimalarial complicate chemotherapy treatment of malaria<br>
patients.<br>
Artemisinin and its derivative artemether, arteether, artelinate and artesunate are a<br>
class of antimalarials compounds derived from Artemisia annua which are now<br>
proving their promising activity and are being used for the treatment of uncomplicated<br>
severe complicated /cerebral and multi drug resistant malaria. Dihydroartemisinin is<br>
derived from artemisinin, a sesquiterpene endoperoxide isolated from the plant<br>
Artemisia annua.<br>
Arteether, a ethyl ether derivative of dihydroartemisinin, a drug introduced in India<br>
for the first time by Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP),<br>
Lucknow, has undergone extensive preclinical, animal, toxicological studies as well<br>
as clinical studies on Indian subjects for drug regulatory purposes. World Health<br>
Organization (WHO) has also recommended arteether as life saving antimalarial drug.<br>
Arteether is more potential as compared to artemisinin and is an ideal antimalarial<br>
drug especially for treating multi drug resistant and complicated strains of<br>
Plasmodium falciparum. Arteether shows rapid schizoticial action with quicker<br>
clearance rate, short fever clearance time with no side effects and low recrudescence<br>
rate.<br>
Brossi, et al (Brossi, A; Venugopalan, B; Domingueg, GL; Yeh,H.J.C; Flippend-<br>
Anderson, J.L.; Buchs, P; Luo, X.D.; Milhous,W and peters, W; J. Med. Chem. 31,<br>
646-649,1988) reported the preparation of arteether, the ethyl ether derivative of<br>
dihydroartemisinin in two steps: First artemisinin was reduced with an excess of<br>
sodium borohydride in methanol at 0 to -5°C in 3 hours to dihydroartemisinin in 79%<br>
yield. In the second step, arteether is prepared by dissolving the dihydroartemisinin in<br>
the solvent mixture of benzene and ethanol at 45°C followed by addition of BF3<br>
etherate and refluxing the reaction mixture at 70°C for one hour. After the<br>
completion of the reaction it was worked up, dried over anhydrous sodium<br>
sulphate with removal of the solvent dichloromethane. The reaction yielded<br>
arteether along with some impurities. Column chromatography of the reaction mixture<br>
over silica gel, 1:20 ratio yielded pure alpha and beta arteether in nearly equal<br>
qualitative yield.<br>
EL-Feraly et al. (EL Feraly, F.S; Al-Yahya MA; Orabi, K.Y; Mc-Phail DR and Me<br>
Phail A.T. J. Nat. Prod. 55, 878-883, 1992) reported the preparation of arteether by a<br>
process in which anhydrodihydroartemisinin, prepared from artemisinin was<br>
dissolved in absolute alcohol. The reaction mixture was stirred in the presence of ptoluene<br>
sulphonic acid used as a catalyst. On workup it yielded a mixture of beta<br>
arteether and C-ll epimer in the ratio of 3:1. In this process only beta arteether is<br>
obtained and separation of C-ll epimer is difficult and preparation of<br>
anhydrodihydroartemisinin is a tedious process. The reaction took 22 hours to<br>
complete. The lewis acid catalyst used in this reaction is required in large amount<br>
(60mg. acid catalyst by lOOmg. anhydrodihydroartemisinin.<br>
In another method Bhakuni etal (Bhakuni, R.S.; Jain D.C and Sharma R.P. Indian. J.<br>
Chemistry, 34B, 529-30,1995) arteether, artemether and other ether derivatives were<br>
prepared from dihydroartemisinin in different alcohol and benzene in the presence of<br>
chlorotrimethylsilane catalyst in 2-4 hours at room temperature. After workup of the<br>
reaction mixture and removal of the solvent, the impure reaction products were<br>
purified over silica gel column to obtained the pure mixture of alpha, beta ethers.<br>
Another method is reported by Lin et al. (Lin, AJ. and Miller, R.E, J.Med Chem.<br>
38,764-770,1995). In this method the new ether derivatives were prepared by<br>
dissolving dihydroartemisinin in anhydrous ether and appropriate alcohol followed<br>
by BFs - etherate. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 hours.<br>
The yield of the purified products ranged from 40-90%. Purification was achieved by<br>
the use of silica gel chromatography.<br>
Yet another method described by Jain et al (Jain D.C, Bhakuni R.S, Saxena S, kumar,<br>
S and Vishwakarma, R.A. ref: US patent 6,346,631, G.B. Application no 0007261.1<br>
and German application no 10014669.4] teaches preparation of arteether from<br>
artemisinin which comprises: Reduction of artemisinin into dihydroartemisinin,<br>
isolation of dihydroartemisinin, conversion of dihydroartemisinin by dissolving it in<br>
alcohol and adding trialkylorthoformate in the reaction mixture, which produce ethers<br>
in quantitative yield in 10 hours at 40 degree C.<br>
The above mentioned methods are not cost effective and are time consuming.<br>
Moreover, benzene, a carcinogenic solvent, used in the previous methods is not<br>
acceptable according to the health standard. Further, all the above methods require<br>
atleast two separate steps to convert artemisinin into ethers i.e reduction of<br>
artemisinin into dihydroartemisinin in the first pot followed by isolation of<br>
dihydroartemisinin and then comes the second step of conversion of<br>
dihydroartemisinin into different ethers in the second pot.<br>
The Assignees co-pending US Application No. 10/105,964 filed on March 25, 2002<br>
which is incorporated herein as prior art reference teaches a process for preparing<br>
artemether from artemisinin. It should be noted that the aforesaid application does not<br>
use a polyhydroxy compound as catalyst during the process of reduction of<br>
artemisinin into dihydroartemisinin. In the present application, the applicants have<br>
utilized a polyhydroxy compound as a catalyst during the step of reduction of<br>
artemisinin to dihydroartemisinin. The Applicants have been successful in reducing<br>
artemisinin to dihydroartemisinin at room temperature in the presence of the<br>
polyhydroxy compound. It should be noted that to carry out a reaction not only the<br>
reactants play an inportant role but also other reaction conditions like solvent used,<br>
cooling or heating, inert atmosphere etc. are also important. Such reaction conditions<br>
provide a particular structure /steriochemistry to the reactant molecules leading to the<br>
desired product. Introduction of the polyhydroxy compound for the reduction of<br>
artemisinin into dihydroartemisinin provides the ideal environment to the reactant<br>
molecules (artemisinin or the reducing agent or both) to reeact at room temperature<br>
(20-30°C) which other react only at temperature in the range of 0-5°C. Also, the<br>
Applicants have found that the extraction of arteether from an aqueous reaction<br>
mixture using 1% ethyl acetate in »-hexane avoids extraction of unwanted polar<br>
impurities as compared to use of dihydromethane in the co-pending application.<br>
Further, the Applicants have found that resin could not perform esterification and<br>
hence, only unrecoverable catalysts such as chlorotrimethylsilane and p-toluene<br>
sulphonic acid are used in the present process. Thus the process of the present<br>
invention can not be considered as being obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the<br>
art and present invention provides an efficient method for conversion of artemisinin to<br>
arteether.<br>
Object of the invention<br>
The object of the present invention is the development of cost effective and improved<br>
single step method for the preparation of arteether which possesses reduction of<br>
artemisinin into dihydroartemisinin in the presence of a catalyst, conversion of<br>
dihydroartemisinin into arteether followed by extraction of the same in a single pot.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a method for the preparation of arteether from<br>
artemisinin in one pot in just about 4 hours. The process of the present invention<br>
comprises: reduction of artemisinin into dihydroartemisinin by less quantity of<br>

polyhydroxy catalyst, acylation of dihydroartemisinin in the presence of an acid<br>
catalyst followed by extraction of arteether from an aqueous reaction mixture using<br>
1% ethyl acetate in «-hexane. Workup of the impure arteether followed by silica gel<br>

In another embodiment of the present invention, the acid catalyst is a solid or a liquid.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the liquid acid catalyst is a<br>
silylated compound.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the silylated compound is<br>
chlorotrimethysilane.<br>
In one more embodiment of the present invention, the w/v ratio of artemisinin and<br>
chlorotrimethysilane is in the range of 1:3 tol: 4.<br>

To describe in detail, in the process of invention, artemisinin and polyhydroxy<br>
catalyst were taken in the ratio of 1:2 to 1:5 w/w and dissolved in ethanol at room<br>
temperature and stirred for 5 minutes. Now sodium borohydride is added slowly at the<br>
room temperature (20 to 23°C) and the reaction mixture is stirred for about 0.5 to 1.5<br>
hours.<br>
After completion of the reduction of artemisinin, without workup or the isolation of<br>
the dihydroartemisinin, a solid acid catalyst, resin or a liquid acid catalyst,<br>
chlorotrimethysilane or trifluroacetic acid is added at 10-20°C and the reaction<br>
mixture is further stirred for about 1 to 2 hours at room temperature.<br>
After completion of the acylation reaction, cooled water is added to the reaction<br>
mixture. The solid catalyst is filtered and the filtrate or the aqueous reaction mixture<br>
extracted with 1% ethyl acetate in n-hexane. During extraction of the crude arteethers<br>
with 1% ethyl-acetate in hexane, the polyhydroxy compound remains in the aqueous<br>
phase and is discarded since it is insoluble in hexane-ethyl acetate mixture but soluble<br>
in aqueous phase. The combined ethyl acetate-hexane extract is washed with 0.5%<br>
sodium bicarbonate solution followed by water.<br>
The extract is dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and removal of the solvent<br>
furnishes impure artemether. Silica gel column chromatography (1:5 to 10 ratio) with<br>
0.5 to 8% ethyl acetate in n-hexane furnishes a mixture of alpha and beta artemether<br>
in 80-86% w/w yield.<br>
Detailed description of the accompanying drawings:<br>
Fig 1 is a schematic representation of the conversion of artemisinin into arteether.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and<br>
should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Artemisinin (1 g.) and polyhydroxy catalyst, dextrose (5 g.) were stirred in ethanol<br>
(20ml) at room temperature for 5 minutes. Now sodium borohydride (600 mg) was<br>
added slowly for 10 minutes and the reaction mixture was stirred for about 1 hour at<br>
room temperature (20-23 °C). The reaction was monitored by TLC to check<br>
completion of the reduction step. Acid catalyst chlorotrimethysilane (3.5 ml) was<br>
added slowly at 10-23°C and the reaction mixture was further stirred at room<br>
temperature for about 1 hour. Cooled water (about 150 ml) was added to the reaction<br>
mixture the aqueous reaction mixture was extracted with 1% ethyl acetate in n-hexane<br>
(3 x 50 ml).<br>
The combined ethyl acetate-hexane extract was washed with 0.5% sodium<br>
bicarbonate (100 ml) followed by water (50 ml). The n-hexane extract was dried over<br>
anhydrous sodium sulphate and evaporation of the solvent yielded 1.038 g. of crude<br>
arteether along with some impurities. The impure artemether purified over silica gel<br>
(10 g.) with o.5 to 8% ethyl acetate in hexane furnished a mixture of alpha and beta<br>
arteether 0.86 g. (86% w/w). Small portion of arteether was separated by preparative<br>
TLC into alpha and beta isomers and characterized by Co-TLC and spectral analysis.<br>
Example 2<br>
Artemisinin (1 g.) and polyhydroxy catalyst, dextrose (4 g.) were stirred in ethanol<br>
(15 ml). Sodium borohydride (500 mg.) was added slowly for 10 minutes and the<br>
reaction mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature (20-23°C). After<br>
completion of the reduction step, chlorotrimethysilane (3.5 ml) was added and the<br>
reaction mixture was further stirred for 1.5 hours at room temperature. After usual<br>
work up and purification through column chromatography (1:5 ratio) a mixture of<br>
alpha and beta arteether (0.805 g., 80.5% w/w) were obtained.<br>
Example 3<br>
Artemisinin (1 g.) and polyhydroxy catalyst, dextrose (2 g.) were stirred in ethanol<br>
(25 ml). Sodium borohydride (700 mg.) was added slowly for 10 minutes and the<br>
reaction mixture was stirred for 1.5 hours at room temperature (20-2 3 °C). After<br>
completion of the reduction step, chlorotrimethysilane (4 ml) was added and the<br>
reaction mixture was further stirred for 2 hours at room temperature (20-23°C) to give<br>
0.95 g. of crude arteether. After usual work up and purification through column<br>
chromatography 0.95 g. of crude arteether yielded 0.825 g. of a mixture of alpha and<br>
beta arteether (82.5% w/w).<br>
Example 4<br>
Artemisinin (100 g.) and polyhydroxy catalyst, dextrose (500 mg.) were stirred in<br>
ethanol (10 ml) for 5 minutes. Sodium borohydride (65 mg.) was added slowly to the<br>
reaction mixture and the same was stirred for 1.25 hours at room temperature (20-<br>
23°C). After completion of the reduction step, /p-toluene sulphonic acid (300 mg.) was<br>
added and the reaction mixture was completed in 4 hours at room temperature. After<br>
usual work up and purification by preparative TLC, the impure reaction product<br>
yielded 53% w/w a mixture of alpha and beta arteether.<br>
Example 5<br>
Artemisinin (100 g.) and polyhydroxy catalyst, galactose (300 mg.) were stirred in<br>
ethanol (5 ml) for 5 minutes. Sodium borohydride (60 mg.) was added slowly to the<br>
reaction mixture and the same was stirred for 1.5 hours at room temperature (20-<br>
23°C). After completion of the reduction step, liquid acid catalyst<br>
chlorotrimethysilane (0.35 ml) was added and the reaction mixture was fUrther stirred<br>
for 2 hours to complete the reaction. After usual work up and purification by<br>
preparative TLC, the impure reaction product afforded 62% w/w of a mixture of alpha<br>
and beta arteether.<br>
Example 6<br>
Artemisinin (100 g.) and polyhydroxy catalyst, phloroglucinol (400 mg.) were stirred<br>
in ethanol. Sodium borohydride (65 mg.) was added slowly to the reaction mixture<br>
and the same was stirred for 2 hours at room temperature (20-23°C). After completion<br>
of the reduction step, chlorotrimethysilane (0.8 ml) was added and the reaction<br>
mixture was further stirred for 2 hours at room temperature to complete the reaction.<br>
