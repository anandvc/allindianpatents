FIELP OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved, fast, ener y saving environment<br>
friendly microwave process for the firing of porcelain components. The method<br>
is highly energy efficient and can be used in a commercial scale to fire porcelain<br>
components in air. The said method achieves better properties of the product<br>
than its conventional processed counterparts.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Porcelain has been used as an electrical insulating material for more than 150<br>
years. For a long time, it has been realized that several characteristic properties<br>
of porcelain (e.g. mechanical strength, high-power dielectric strength and<br>
corrosion resistance) as a ceramic product cannot be obtained in other materials.<br>
Porcelain is distinguished by the lack of open porosity in fired body. This ceramic<br><br><br>
is commonly referred as a triaxial whiteware primarily composed of clay, flux and<br>
filler. Potash feldspar or sodium feldspar is generally used as fluxes and quartz<br>
or alumina is used as fillers depending on their end use. Two types of porcelain<br>
insulators are used, the silica and alumina porcelain. In the disclosure these<br>
materials are referred as quartz body and alumina body porcelain.<br>
In quartz based porcelain, high temperature or long firing time leads to a<br>
reduction of solid quartz content in ceramic body because of melting of quartz<br>
grains. This reduction causes the decrease of mechanical strength of porcelain.<br>
Further, the difference between thermal expansion corresponding to quartz<br>
grains and the surrounding liquid phase causes mechanical stress, which can<br>
produce microcracks in porcelain. Intense changes of piece temperature could<br>
lead to increase in the already existing microcracks, causing reduction of<br>
mechanical strength under load. In alumina porcelain, the major portion of<br>
quartz is replaced by alumina, which leads to increase in mechanical strength<br>
(related to smaller number of cracks). During sintering, mullite and corundum<br>
are formed and porcelain is obtained with high content of glass phase that leads<br><br>
to non-porosity but without the melting of alumina grains (thus high temperature<br>
and long time of firing do not affect the mechanical strength). The alumina<br>
porcelain is insensitive to temperature changes and mechanical strength is<br>
mainly controlled by quantity of corundum (and not by the amount of mullite as<br>
in silica porcelain.<br>
The manufacturing of porcelain insulator involves mainly three steps: forming,<br>
drying, and firing. After forming they are dried in order to achieve the critical<br>
moisture level, below which there will not be further shrinkage of the porcelain<br>
body during drying. Ceramic processing is based on the sintering of powder<br>
compacts rather than melting / solidification / cold working (characteristic for<br>
metals). Sintering commonly refers to processes involved in the heat treatment<br>
of powder compacts at elevated temperatures, usually at T &gt; 0.5 Tm, in the<br>
temperature range where diffusional mass transport is appreciable. Successful<br>
sintering usually results in a dense polycrystalline solid. During sintering this<br>
triaxial composition undergoes varied chemical reactions at different<br>
temperature. Fully sintered porcelain consists of a glassy matrix with quartz or<br>
alumina crystals with primary or secondary mullite, which is responsible for the<br>
strength of the fired porcelain.<br><br><br>
In regular practice, insulator is fired in the range of 1200째 C to 1300째 C with a<br>
cycle time exceeding 100 hrs. Therefore, the porcelain insulator manufacturing<br>
process is an energy and time intensive process, which will take 14 - 20 days of<br>
time and enormous amount of energy. The large proportion of the selling price<br>
of these items represents energy costs. While ceramic producers have always<br>
had a high awareness of energy costs, they are increasingly motivated to act, as<br>
energy prices increase and global competition intensifies. More than 70% of<br>
energy in ceramics manufacturing is accounted for the drying and firing process,<br>
with oil and gas as the predominant fuels.<br>
To solve this problem, an alternative method is adopted with microwave heating.<br>
This is a most promising technology over the conventional one with an<br>
advantage of time and energy savings. The process enables high rate of heating<br>
resulting in cycle time reduction and low energy consumption. This facilitates<br>
low cost of the product. Further, materials will experience the minimization of<br>
grain growth leading to improved mechanical strength. The volumetric heating<br>
will avoid any temperature gradient inside the body. The process is based on<br>
clean electrical energy and thus is an environment friendly technology.<br><br><br>
The microwave processing of porcelain is rather complicated since porcelain as<br>
such is a complex material and the fast heating rate by microwave processing<br>
poses further challenge in achieving the proper phase formation. The reactions<br>
occurred during firing needs to be properly controlled in order to achieve the<br>
best properties. The additional reducing atmosphere during processing<br>
complicates the overall processing. Further, the earlier experiments have not<br>
used the commercial compositions, rather concentrated on laboratory level-<br>
experiments, which is a problem in scale-up for commercial exploitation.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
One of the objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process<br>
for the firing of an indigenously available commercial quartz based porcelain<br>
material in air.<br>
Another objective of the invention is to reduce the firing cycle of electro<br>
porcelain materials in the range of 75 - 85 % of that employed in the present<br>
commercial conventional process.<br><br><br>
A further objective of the invention is to reduce the energy requirement of<br>
processing porcelain materials in the range of 60 - 80 % of that used in the<br>
conventional commercial process.<br>
A still another objective of the invention is to confirm the retention of the<br>
required properties of the porcelain insulator body after processing by a very<br>
rapid firing cycle.<br>
PRIOR STATE OF THE ART<br>
Porcelain is a complex material and sintering to full density with required phases<br>
need careful consideration. This is the main reason of not much literature<br>
available on the microwave sintering of porcelain materials.<br>

to have sintered clay-quartz-feldspar system both by conventional (electric<br>
furnace) and microwave using 2.45 GHz frequency in air. The authors reported<br>
that to achieve the same degree of water absorption, the temperature applied in<br><br><br>
microwave hybrid sintering was slightly higher (approximately 20째 C) than those<br>
used in conventional firing. However, this result is mainly concentrated on small<br>
1 inch sample pieces which cannot be scaled up for any property measurements<br>
like strength, modulus etc. Since, the processing of porcelain is material specific,<br>
it is pertinent to experiment using indigenously available raw materials. Further,<br>
the result demonstrating that microwave requires higher temperature than that<br>
of conventional process cannot be properly explained and that will increase the<br>
cost of the product.<br>

microwave sintered porcelain, and in microwave: Theory and application in<br>

effect of 84 GHZ microwave heating on the sintering properties of porcelain<br>
bodies in Kaolin-feldspar-quartz (KFQ) systems which is similar to the quartz<br>
body porcelain material. The study highlighted that it is very important to<br>
consider the temperature difference between liquid amorphous phase and the<br>
solid crystalline phases during microwave processing of porcelain bodies.<br>
However the effect of microwave radiation at widely used 2.45 GHz frequency on<br>
the sintering of these materials is needed to be studied in this material, since 84<br>
GHZ frequency is not used commercially to exploit processing of materials.<br>
Further, the porcelain after firing was porous and thus cannot be used in high<br>
voltage porcelain applications.<br><br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
To achieve the objects, and purpose of present invention, a method has been<br>
developed which allows sintering of porcelain components in air using an environment-<br>
friendly process. The processing has been carried out using a microwave furnace<br>
operating at 2.45 GHz frequency. This method enables reduction of cycle time by 70-<br>
80% and reduction in energy cost by 60-80% over conventional method. Further, the<br>
properties of the sintered products as measured by different analytical techniques were<br>
shown to be either comparable or in some cases better than their conventional<br>
counterparts. The process is environment friendly since it does not use the ever-<br>
depleting fossil fuels for processing. The technology developed here can be scaled up in<br>
a commercial scale in processing porcelains for high voltage applications.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided an improved environ-friendly<br>
energy saving microwave process for fast sintering of shaped porcelain components in<br>
air from quartz based raw materials consisting of feldspar, washed clay, raw clay,<br>
quartz based raw materials consisting of feldspar (11-13%), washed clay (20-25%),<br>
raw clay (25-35%), quartz (20-23%), pyrophyllite (8-10%) and felcite (5-8%)<br>
comprising firing shaped component in a microwave furnace using a suitable casket and<br>
susceptor arrangement in air at peak sintering temperature of 1200째C to 1260째C with<br>
soaking period of 300 minutes; maintaining heating cycle from 6 to 10 hour during<br>
sintering; resulting densified porcelain product with reduced porosity, higher bending<br>
strength and electrical properties through phase formation comprising of Quartz, Mullite<br>
and amorphous.<br><br><br>
The present invention will be better understood by the narrated description for<br>
an embodiment below with reference to the accompanying drawings in which<br>
Figure 1 (a) represents an arrangement of samples for firing and<br>
circular disc sample (b) for temperature measurement.<br>
Figure 2 represents a firing cycle of microwave processing<br>
according to the invention and conventional processing of<br>
porcelain insulator components.<br>
Figure 3 represents X-ray diffraction patterns of quartz body porcelains<br>
which are sintered by conventional and by improved microwave<br>
process, showing the main crystalline peaks for quartz and mullite.<br>
Figure 4 shows scanning electron micrograph of (a) microwave<br>
and (b) conventionally sintered (1240째 C) with magnification<br>
of 10,000 for microwave heating time-8 hours against<br>
conventional heating time ~ 90 hours.<br>
The present invention provides an improved method for the microwave firing of<br>
commercial grade and indigenously available quartz based porcelain insulator<br>
components with following raw materials: Feldspar, washed clay, Raw clay,<br>
Quarts, Pyrophyllite and Felcite.<br><br><br>
In a conventional commercial process, the raw materials are intimately mixed<br>
with wet mixing in a ball mill followed by filter pressing to obtain the cakes of<br>
desired hardness. These cakes were used for further shaping of actual porcelain<br>
insulators. The components are dried and sintered in a kiln using fossil fuels<br>
with total cycle time exceeding 100 hour in a partial reducing atmosphere.<br>
In the improved method, the shaped components of high (length / diameter ratio<br>
(10: 1) were used for firing in air in a microwave furnace using a suitable casket<br>
and susceptor arrangement. Figure 1 depicts a schematic of samples placed in a<br>
microwave furnace for sintering. The temperature was measured by emissivity<br>
corrected infrared contact less pyrometer. A typical firing curve used in the<br>
present method is depicted in Figure 2 implying drastic reduction in firing cycle<br>
than that employed in the conventional process. The advantage of this method<br>
is that the microwave power can be switched off after the soaking period at the<br>
peak temperature is over, which is not the case in the conventional method. The<br>
peak sintering temperature and the process cycle have been varied to optimize<br>
the microwave firing of porcelain components.<br>
The x-ray diffraction pattern of the sintered product is compared with that<br>
obtained by conventional method (Figure 3) of sintering in a Kiln using fossil fuel.<br>
All the required phases could be fully formed by the very fast method employed<br>
in the present invention, thus necessitating the need to use this technology in a<br>
commercial scale. The microstructure of the product after firing by the new<br>
method also confirmed the phase formation from the identical microstructure as<br><br><br>
obtained in the conventional method (Figure 4). Similar microstructure in both<br>
the processes indicates that reducing atmosphere in conventional processing is<br>
not an essential step in developing the right microstructure during fast-fired<br>
microwave processing. From this observation the processing cycle of quartz-<br>
based porcelain has been developed for commercial scale production of porcelain<br>
components.<br>
The invention is illustrated with testing results wherein<br>
Table 1 shows properties of conventional and microwave sintered<br>
cylindrical rods of Quartz based Porcelain insulator components.<br>
Table 2 shows porosity variation along the length of rod<br>
at different conditions and<br>
Table 3 shows phase content of porcelain body after processing<br>
by conventional and the present improved microwave<br>
sintering methods.<br>
Table 1	summarizes the best results achieved on the microwave fired<br>
porcelain products indicating better mechanical properties from the<br>
new method and comparable electrical properties. The electrical<br>
properties of microwave sintered porcelain material is improved<br>
which was not reported in earlier literature and confirms that<br>
microwave firing of porcelain is ideal in an industrial scale to<br>
achieve the competitiveness of the product in the market.<br><br><br><br><br>
The samples were initially fired at 1210째 C with a heating cycle of 6 hour and a<br>
soaking period of 30 minute at the peak temperature. It was observed that, the<br>
samples were not fully sintered and the difference in porosity content was very<br>
high from top to bottom of the sample (table 2). The cycle time and<br>
temperature are two most important parameters to achieve uniformed fully<br>
sintered body. Few more experiments were carried out by varying the heating<br>
cycle and the peak temperature keeping the soaking period of 30 minutes<br>
constant in all the experiments. It was observed that, the heating cycle of ~ 8<br>
hours and a peak temperature of ~ 1240째 C is ideal in both reducing the porosity<br>
variation throughout the sample and simultaneously densifying the component<br>
uniformly. This series of experiments have confirmed that microwave heating of<br>
these compositions do not require higher temperature than that used in<br>
conventional process.<br>
The peak temperature, duration at peak temperature and the heating cycle are<br>
three important parameters for proper densification of samples. The peak<br>
temperature plays a very important role in final densification of the product and<br>
imparting properties to the final product. In this experiment, the peak<br>
temperature was varied from 1220째 C, 1240째 C and 1260째 C keeping the soaking<br>
duration constant at 30 minutes. All other experimental conditions were kept<br>
constant. It was observed that the bending strength of the samples varied<br>
drastically from 85 MPa for 1220째 C firing to 118 MPa for 1240째 C firing to 107<br>
MPa for 1260째 C firing. This result indicated that the peak temperature of 1240째<br>
C is ideal in imparting maximum strength in this porcelain composition. It Is<br><br><br>
pertinent to mention that the same peak temperature is commonly used in the<br>
conventional commercial process, however, the strength of the microwave-<br>
sintered body is significantly higher than that of its conventional counterpart.<br>
Further, this result has established that higher sintering temperature than that<br>
used in commercial process is not suitable for achieving better properties in<br>
these materials.<br>
The amorphous phase content in porcelain plays an important role in optimizing<br>
the properties. The higher peak temperature and higher heating time are<br>
directly proportional to higher glass phase formation which translates to lower<br>
mechanical properties. Besides the amorphous content, the amount of<br>
crystalline phase like quartz and mullite and cristobalite influences the properties<br>
of porcelain material. It is always desirable to possess lower amorphorous<br>
content and higher crystalline content to obtain better properties in a quartz<br>
based porcelain material. This is limited in conventional processing due to high<br>
heating time. The present method of microwave processing is a very fast<br>
process and it contributes to the phase formation with significant improvement of<br>
characteristic properties.<br>
The quantitative x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out on the porcelain<br>
samples sintered at different conditions and analyzed by Rietvield method. The<br>
quantified XRD results (table 3) on microwave-sintered rods (MR) were<br>
compared with that of conventionally processed rod sample. It was observed<br>
that the amorphous phase content was lower and the crystalline phase content<br><br><br>
was higher in the present microwave sintered samples in contrast to that<br>
processed by conventional process. This result is supportive of higher<br>
mechanical properties in these materials as described earlier. The higher quartz<br>
content in microwave-processed samples contributes significantly to the<br>
mechanical properties. The significant amount of cristobalite phase as present in<br>
conventional processed samples was not found in microwave processed samples.<br>
The results have confirmed that the new improved microwave process described<br>
in this invention is ideal for the processing of porcelain materials.<br>
The main advantages of the new improved process are;<br>
a)	The improved method is extremely fast process and less energy-intensive<br>
without affecting the properties of the component. This translates into<br>
very low cost for the processing of such materials in an industrial scale.<br>
b)	The new method entails the firing of porcelain in air so that a<br>
combination of reducing and oxidizing atmosphere is not required as<br>
employed in the conventional process.<br>
c)	The process yields less amorphous phase content and higher crystalline<br>
phase content resulting better properties than that obtained by<br>
conventional commercial process.<br><br>
d)	The electrical properties of the fired product by the new method are<br>
either comparable or better compared to those obtained by the<br>
conventional process.<br>
e)	The new method is environment friendly process since it does not utilize<br>
fossil fuels.<br>
f)	The new process does not require higher temperature than that of<br>
conventional process.<br>
The invention as narrated herein with an embodiment and illustrated with test<br>
results should not be read and construed in a restrictive manner as various<br>
adaptations, changes and modifications are possible within the limit and scope of<br>
the invention as defined and encompassed in the appended claims.<br><br><br>
