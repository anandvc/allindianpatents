The compounds of the present invention may be employed to generate a chirai transition metal catalyst comprising a suitable transition metal bound to a compound of the formula<br><br>
wherein<br>
R is optionally substituted alkyi, cycioalkyl, aryl or heteroaryl;<br>
R' and R" are independently optionally substituted alkyl, cycioalkyl, aryl or heteroaryl; or an enantiomer thereof; or an enantiomeric mixture thereof.<br>

(R)-5,5'~bis(disubstitutedphosphinoK 3'H)-tetrone; and<br><br>
(S)-5,5'-bis(disubstitutedphosphino)^ 3'HHetrone.<br>
Suitable transition metals for the catalyst system of the present invention include, but are not limited to, copper (Cu), iridium (ir), nickel (Ni), palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), rhodium (Rh) and ruthenium (Ru). Preferably, the transition metal is palladium.<br>
Particularly useful are the catalysts of the present invention wherein the transition metal is palladium, and the transition metal is bound to a compound of formula (I) wherein<br>
R is monocyclic aryl;<br>
R' and R" are independently lower alkyl; or an enantiomer thereof; or an enantiomeric mixture thereof.<br>

R is phenyl;<br>
R'and R" are methyl; or an enantiomer thereof; or an enantiomeric mixture thereof.<br>
Especially useful are also the catalysts of the present invention wherein the transition metal<br>
is palladium, and the transition metal is bound to a compound of formula (I) which is selected<br>
from the group consisting of:<br>
(R)-5,5'-bis(disubsttutedphosphinoH^<br>
3'H)-tetrone; and<br>

The compounds of the present invention may be prepared by deprotonating a compound of the formula <br>
wherein R' and R" have meanings as defined herein above and X represents halogen, such as iodide, bromide or chloride, with a base such as lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) or lithium<br><br><br><br><br>
wherein R( R' and R" have meanings as defined herein above. The Ullmann coupling reaction is preferably conducted at a temperature ranging from about 100 °C to about 160 °C, preferably at a temperature of about 140°C, in the presence of an inorganic salt such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate or sodium oxalate, or a mixture of salts thereof, to facilitate the coupling reaction. Interestingly, the coupling reaction is accompanied by the spontaneous migration of the R' and R" groups from the oxygen atoms to the nitrogen atoms.<br>
A resulting racemic compound of formula (VI) may then be resolved into its optical antipodes, i.e., enantiomers, by known methods, e.g., by separation of the diastereoisomeric salts thereof, e.g., by fractional crystallization of a (+)- or (-)-dibenzoyltartaric acid salt thereof, e.g., from a 1:1-mixture of ethyl acetate and chloroform. The optically active compound of the formula<br><br>
wherein R, R' and R" have meanings as defined herein above, may then be liberated, e.g., by treatment with base such as aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to afford a free compound of formula R-(VI) or S-(VI), or an enantiomeric mixture thereof. A racemic<br><br>
compound of formula (VI) may also be resolved by chiral chromatography, e.g., high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a chiral adsorbent.<br>
Finally, a compound of formula (VI), or an enantiomer thereof, or an enantiomeric mixture thereof, may be treated with a reducing agent, such as trichlorosiiane, in the presence of an organic base, such as triethylamine or tri-n-butylamine, and an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent, such as toluene or xylene, to afford a compound of formula (I), or an enantiomer thereof, or an enantiomeric mixture thereof, respectively, wherein R, R1 and R" have meanings as defined herein above. Preferably, the reduction is conducted in toluene in an autoclave, at a temperature of about 120 °C.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may then be converted to chiral transition metal catalysts of the present invention by reacting a compound of formula (I), or an enantiomer thereof, or an enantiomeric mixture thereof, with a suitable transition metal salt, or a complex thereof, to afford a catalyst of the present invention. The choice of a suitable transition metal salt, or a complex thereof, is generally known to those skilled in the art and depends on the nature of the asymmetric reaction to be performed. A suitable transition metal salt, or a complex thereof, for the preparation of a catalyst of the present invention may be selected, e.g., from those described herein in the illustrative examples. Further examples of such transition metal salts may be found, e.g., in Seyden-Penne, "Chiral Auxiliaries and Ligands in Asymmetric Synthesis'1, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., NY (1995). A catalyst of the present invention may be generated in situ, or it may be isolated prior to use.<br>
The catalysts of the present invention obtainable as described herein may be employed for converting a racemic or a prochiral substrate to a chiral product under reaction conditions otherwise suitable for asymmetric induction.<br>
Such asymmetric reactions include, but are not limited to, catalytic hydrogenation, hydrosilylation, hydroboration, hydroformylation, hydrocarboxylation, hydroacylation, Heck reaction and allylic substitution reactions. The catalysts of the present invention are especially effective when employed in allylic substitution reactions. For example, a compound of formula (I) may be reacted with a palladium complex such as a dimer of allyl palladium chloride or tris(dibenzylideneacetone)paIIadium in a suitable organic solvent such as dichloromethane (DCM) to obtain a catalyst of the present invention. The resulting catalyst may then be used in situ in a suitable palladium catalyzed reaction, e.g., in an<br><br><br><br>
Similarly, the results of a palladium catalyzed allylic amination using benzylamine as the nucleophile and (R)-PM-Phos as the chiral ligand are summarized in Table 2. As exemplified in entries 1 and 2, an asymmetric allylic amination employing a catalyst of the present invention provides chiral allylic amines with considerably higher catalytic activity and enantioseiectivity than that obtained with the well known diphosphine iigand BINAP under identical reaction conditions.<br><br>

If not mentioned otherwise, all evaporations are performed under reduced pressure, preferably between about 5 and 50 mmHg.
