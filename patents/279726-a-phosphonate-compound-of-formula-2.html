BACKGROUND ART<br>
Purine or pyrimidine derivatives have anti-cancer and antiviral activities, and more than 10 kinds of the compounds including AZT, 3TC and ACV have already been commercialized. Particularly, since acyclic nucleoside phosphonate derivatives show a potent antiviral effect, cidopovir has been commercialized as an antiviral agent and many compounds including PMEA and PMPA now entered into the step of clinical trials. However, the earlier developed compounds were not perfect in the aspects of toxicity or pharmaceutical activity, and thus, it is still desired to develop a compound having no toxicity as well as a superior activity. The prior researches for purine or pyrimidine derivatives or acyclic nucleoside phosphonate derivatives as reported heretofore are as follows.

The compound of the present invention exhibits a potent pharmacological effect to a hepatitis B cell line, HepG2.2.15, and a transgenic mouse, widely used for development of a therapeutic agent against hepatitis B, when intravenously or orally adminis'iered. The experimental procedures and results are described below.<br>
Experiment 1<br>
Measurement and Analysis of Inhibition Effect against Hepatitis B Virus<br>
(HBV)<br>
(1)	Cell Culture and Treatment with Drugs<br>
HepG2.2.15 cell (M.A Shells et al., P.N.A.S. 84, 1005(1987)), a hepatocarcinoma cell line producing hepatitis B virus, was cultured in DMEM medium(GIBCO BRL. #430-22001 containing 10% FBS(Fetus bovine serum, GIBCO BRL. #16000-044). 1% ABAM (Antibiotic-Antimycotic, GIBCO BRL, #16000-028) and 400/µg/ml of geneticin( Sigma, #G-9516) in a T-75 flask under the conditions of 5% CO: incubator and 37ºC by dividing in a ratio of 1:3 at an interval of 3 days. The cells were distributed into a 96-well plate in the amount of 4x104/well and then when 80-90% of cell density was achieved, the old medium was changed with 200µl. of DMEM medium containing 2% FBS. 1% ABAM and 400µg/mlof geneticin. The drug solution was sequentially diluted five-fold each time, from 100 M to 0.16 M. In order to minimize an experimental error, each treatment was repeated 2-3 times for the respective drugs. The medium was changed every two days. On 10 days after the treatment with drug, 100µlof the medium was collected and the degree of inhibition of viral replication by drugs was determined through quantitative PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction).<br>
(2)	Determination of Cytotoxicity<br>
After 100µl of the medium was collected on 10th day from the treatment with drug, 7.5mginft of MTT (Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Broide. Amresco. #0793-5G&gt; solution was added to each well in the amount of 30µl/well and each cell was cultured for 2 hours in a 5% CO2 incubator at37ºC The solution was discarded, and an sopropanol solution containing 1 • Triton X-l-V. and 0.4µl. of c-HCI was added to ean. meil in the amount of 120µl/well. The cells thus dyed, were transferred to the isopropanol solution by shaking for 2 hours.    Absorbance at 540nm was measured by Elisa Reader.<br>
(3) PCR Estimation of Inhibition Effect on Hepatitis B Virus Replication<br>
The degree of inhibition by drugs on the replication of hepatitis B virus was . determined using the cell culture solution collected on 10th day after the treatment with the drug. The cell culture solution treated with each drug was diluted ten-fold with distilled water and subjected to a pretreatment to destroy the cells by heating them for 15 minutes at 95 ºC. For the PCR amplification of the gene fragment of about 320bp, the 2001-base position that is conserved in all sub-strain of hepatitis B virus and 2319-base position that is between the core antigen gene and polymerase gene were used as 5'-end and 3'-end primer, respectively. Then, the amount of genomic DNA of hepatitis B virus was quantified, and the inhibitory effect by drugs on the replication of hepatitis B virus was determined on the basis thereof.<br>
First, the cell culture solution of hepatitis B virus that was not treated with drug was sequentially diluted and amplified through the PCR. The amplified DNA was subjected to electrophoresis on 2% agarose, gel and stained with ethidium bromide (EtBn to be analyzed by IS-1000 (Innotech Scientific Corporation) Digital Imaging System. Analysis of the cell culture solution treated with drug was then carried out using the dilution fold in the range where linearity is maintained. The DNA obtained from the group treated with drug was amplified through the same PCR method, subjected to electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and analyzed by IS-1000. The degree of inhibition by drugs in the viral replication was quantified by calculating the ratio of test group to control group. Table S summarizes the inhibitory-effect (pharmaceutical activity and toxicity) of the typical compounds of the present invention.<br>

As can be seen from the results of Table 8, the compound according to the present<br>
invention exhibits 4 to 10-fold greater activity than the comparative compound PMEA that is on Phase III in clinical trials.<br>
Experiment 2<br>
Pharmacological Test on Transgenic mouse (T/G mouse)<br>
The compounds were administered via subcutaneous and oral routes in the following animal test.<br>
The test compounds were administered to 4-5 weeks old HBV transgenic mice, which were obtained from FVB strain mice according to a method described in a reference (see, Jone D. Morrey. Kevin W. Bailey, Brent E. Korba, Robert W. Sidwell. "Utilization of transgenic mice replicating high levels of hepatitis B virus for antiviral evaluation of lamivudine" Antiviral research, 1999, 42, 97-108), subcutaneously for 9 days in the amount of 10mg/kg/day and orally for 9 days in the amount of 10, 2 and 0.4mg/kg/day, once a day, respectively (the same number of males and females were used). Blood was collected from the tail of the mouse and 5µl. of serum was obtained. To this serum was added 15ml of Genereleaser sol, which was then pretreated in different temperatures. HBV DNA was taken from the pretreated solution. The DNA was amplified by the PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) in the presence of 4µl of 10 x buffer (Perkin Elmer), 0.8µl. of l0mM dNTP, 500ng of the same HBV primers as used in Experiment 1. 2.125mM of MgCl2, DMSO and Taq polymerase. The amount of HBV DNA was analyzed by electrophoresis in order to evaluate a pharmacological effect of the compound of the present invention. The results are described in the following Table 9. In the following Table 9, mice showing pharmacological effect  means the mice whose blood does not contain HBV DNA.<br>

<br>
<br>
* The result means ""number of mice showing pharmacological effect / number of total mice<br>
As can be seen in the above Table 9, the compound of the present invention shows a potent hepatitis B therapeutic effect in the tested animals when orally or subcutaneouslv administered. Particularly, since the compound of the present invention is superior to the comparative compound PMEA, which is on Phase III in clinical trials, it is expected that the compound of the present invention may be used very effectively for the tr atment of hepatitis B.<br>
