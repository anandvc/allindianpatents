Flame retardant polymeric compositions<br>
Subject of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to flame retarded thermoplastic moulding<br>
compositions selected in particular from olefinic polymers, a process for<br>
their preparation and their use in the preparation of flame retarded<br>
polyolefinic articles.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
it has well known that polyolefinic polymers are particularly sensitive to the<br>
ignition with flame; therefore they need a suitable protection especially for<br>
critical appiications such as part of household electric appliances,<br>
construction materials, and interior decorative materials.<br>
For these applications several studies to impart satisfactory fire resistance<br>
have been carried out.<br>
For example, Japanese patents 53-92855, 54-29350, 54-77658, 56-26954,<br>
57-87482, 60-110738 disclose a method for preparing flame retardant<br>
polypropylene resin compositions by using inorganic flame retardant<br>
additive like Magnesium hydroxide, aluminium hydroxide, hydrotalcite or the<br>
like.<br>
All these additives, however, in order to be effective need to be added at a<br>
level higher than 50% (by weight) based on the weight of final composition<br>
with the result that the processability is bad and the mechanical properties<br>
are drastically deteriorated.<br>
Also well known are flame retardant polymeric compositions based on<br>
halogenated (brominated or chlorinated) organic products such as those<br>
disclosed, for example, in Japanese patents 55-30739.and 8-302102. JP 8-<br>
302102 relates to a flame retardant polypropylene resin composition where<br>
the polymer is mixed with 8-15 wt% of an organohalogen compound (flame<br>
retardant A) and 1-3 wt% of an halogenated epoxy oligomer (flame<br>
retardant B) as well as with other additives, for example antimony trioxide.<br>
These additives have been recognised to be very effective for ranking both<br>
V2 and V0 flammability grade, according to the UL 94 standards, but they<br><br>
normally cause the corrosion of the equipment used for processing due to<br>
the emission of acids and will develop toxic fumes in case of fire. In<br>
addition, the corresponding polymeric articles show high blooming and are<br>
endued with poor weather resistance.<br>
It has been also known that flame retarded polypropylene articles can be<br>
achieved with the use of an intumescent system based on two or three<br>
components comprising:<br>
•	an acid component, generally phosphorus containing agent;<br>
•	a foaming agent, generally a nitrogen containing product such as for<br>
example ammonium polyphosphate, melamine or the like;<br>
•	a carbonific compound which Is generally a sugar like product as for<br>
example mono-, di-, tri-pentaerythritol or tris (2-hydroxyethyl)<br>
isocyanurate (THEIC).<br>
US 4,312,805 discloses self-extinguishing polymer compositions comprising<br>
an ammonium or amine phosphate and one or more nitrogen organic<br>
compound, while US 4,253,972 discloses flame retardant polyolefin<br>
compositions comprising a pentate salt of an amino-s-triazine and a<br>
polyhydrlc alcohol. US 4,198,493; US 5,312,853; US 4,727,102; US<br>
3,810,862; US 4,198,493; WO 2004 063262 also disclose similar polymer<br>
compositions.<br>
In all cases the additivation level of such flame retardant systems is<br>
normally in the range of from 25% to 35% wt on the weight of total<br>
compound and therefore the mechanical properties, the weather resistance<br>
and the aesthetic properties of corresponding polymer articles are not<br>
satisfactory,<br>
WO 2005 019330, discloses a particular system suitable for ranking V2 in<br>
polypropylene homopolymer articles. The disclosed flame retardant<br>
polymeric composition has a low halogen content and comprises, as<br>
essential components:<br>
- a nitrogen containing compound such as a triazine or a mixture of<br>
triazines of general formula (I)<br><br>
-	an halogen containing compound<br>
-	a bismuth compound of formula Bi2Aw<br>
-	a compound selected from the group consisting of red phosphorus, a<br>
phosphorous compound and an organic compound<br>
In the described system, the halogen can be brought either by the nitrogen<br>
containing product, generally a melamine based material, or by the Bismuth<br>
salt or by both and the total halogen in the composition is quite low.<br>
This interesting composition has been reported to be effective in unfilled<br>
homo-polypropylene only and even so it is not fully satisfactory because of<br>
the discoloration of polymer articles due to the negative interaction of<br>
components. In addition, it has to be noted that the bismuth compound,<br>
which is essential In the above cited prior art composition, might cause<br>
severe environmental problems (La medicina Biologica, october-december<br>
2001 - A.M:Pasciuto - XVI national meeting - Milan 02.06.2001 - Rome<br>
09.06.2001).<br>
Object of the Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide flame retarded<br>
thermoplastic moulding compositions and articles based on polypropylene<br>
resins having good mechanical properties, good weather resistance along<br>
with good flame retardant grade.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide moulding compositions<br>
and articles based on filled polyolefinic resins characterised by satisfactory<br>
flame retardant properties.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide flame retarded polyolefininc<br>
articles with a very low halogen concentration level, hardly detectable with<br>
the usual analytical methods.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br>
preparation of flame retarded moulding compositions and articles based on<br>
polyolefinic resins.<br>
Again object of the present invention is to provide flame-retarded<br>
thermoplastic moulding compositions to be used in the preparation of flame<br><br>
retarded polymer articles.<br>
Detailed description of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to polymeric compositions having improved flame<br>
resistance.<br>
It has been surprisingly found that the objects of the present invention are<br>
satisfied with thermoplastic moulding compositions and moulded articles<br>
based on said polymeric composition which comprise at least a combination<br>
of a hypophosphorous acid metal salt and an halogen containing compound.<br>
According to the present invention, the flame retardant thermoplastic<br>
moulding composition comprises:<br>
A.	from 65% to 99,5% by weight of a polyolefinic polymer especially<br>
selected among polypropylene polymers;<br>
B.	from 0,1% to 35% by weight of a synergistic mixture of an<br>
hypophosphorous acid metal sait and an halogenated organic<br>
compounds;<br>
C.	from 0,5% to 10 % by weight of a plurality of selected additives<br>
comprising processing aids, heat and process stabilisers, UV<br>
stabilisers, antidripping agents (PTFE -Polytetrafluoroethylene),<br>
pigments, mould releasing agents, nucleating agents;<br>
D.	from 0% to 50% by weight of an inorganic filler.<br>
The total of the percentages by weight of components A to D is 100 %.<br>
Said hypophosphorous acid metal salt is selected, according to the present<br>
invention, among aluminium or calcium hypophosphite.<br>
Such polymeric compositions are based on thermoplastic polymers, such as<br>
polyolefins, particularly selected as polypropylene.<br>
In the meaning of the invention a polyolefinic resin is any polymer derived<br>
from a variety of monomers especially propylene, ethylene, butene,<br>
isobutene, pentene, hexene, heptene, octene, 2-methyl propene, 2-<br>
methylbutene, 4-methyl pentene, 4-methyl hexene, 5-methylhexene,<br>
butadiene, pentadiene, hexadiene, isoprene, 2,3-dimethylbutadiene, vinyl<br>
ciclohexene, cyclopentadiene, styrene, and methyl styrene.<br><br>
The polyoiefin resins include also copolymers produced from any of the<br>
above mentioned monomers and the like and further include copolymers<br>
which contain an olefinic carboxylic acid or anhydride or ester like for<br>
example acrylic acid, maleic anhydride, vinyl acetate.<br>
At last polyoiefin resins include homopolymer blends, copolymer blends and<br>
homopolymer-copolymer blends.<br>
The preferred polyolefins are polypropylene including atactic-, syndiotactic-<br>
and isotactic- polypropylene, polyethylene including low density, high density,<br>
linear low density and block and random copolymers of ethylene and<br>
propylene. All these polymers may be produced through a variety of catalytic<br>
processes well known by the skilled of the art including the Ziegler/Natta and<br>
the metallocene catalysed processes.<br>
The polymers may have a wide range of melt flow index (MFI) but typically<br>
they have values ranging from 1 to 50 g/10 min.<br>
The flame retardant moulding compositions according to the present<br>
invention comprises as flame retardant system from 0,1% to 35 % by weight<br>
on weight of moulding composition, preferably from 0,5% to 25% by weight,<br>
of a mixture based on hypophosphorous acid metal salts and halogen<br>
containing compounds.<br>
The hypophosphorus acid metal salt can be any product with the following<br>
chemical formula:<br>
(PH2O2)nMe<br>
where:<br>
n is an integer number ranging from 1 to 4 in dependance of the valence of<br>
the metal Me,<br>
Me is any atom selected from the group consisting of sodium, calcium, magnesium,<br>
zinc, tin and aluminium, and the hypophosphorous acid metal salt is commercially<br>
available hypophosphorous acid salts of sodium, calcium, magnesium, zinc, tin and<br>
aluminium, and most preferably the hypophosphorous acid metal salt is aluminium or<br>
calcium hypophosphite.<br><br>
In the meaning of the present invention, the halogenated compound can be<br>
any organic or inorganic product which contain one or more bromine or<br>
chlorine atoms, however the preferred products are the brominated and<br>
chlorinated organic compounds widely used as flame retardant agents for<br>
organic polymers with particular regard to the commercially available ones<br>
generally used for flame retarding polyolefinic resins such as for example:<br>
decabramo diphenyl oxide, hexabromocyclododecane, ethylene<br>
bistetrabromophthalimide, tris (tribromoneopentyl) phosphate, adducts of<br>
hexachloropentadiene and cyclo octadiene, the most preferred being<br>
tetrabromo bis phenol A bis( 2,3- dibromopropyl ether).<br>
Meiamine hydrobromide may also be utilised as halogenated compound<br>
within the meaning of the present invention.<br>
The weight ratio of hypophosphorous acid metal salt on halogenated<br>
compound depends on the chemical nature of the used products, however it<br>
can range from 6 to 1/6, more preferably it can range from 3 to 1/3.<br>
Even if it is advisable that the content of the halogenated product in the<br>
polymeric article results to be as lowest as possible, according to the present<br>
invention the halogen content in the final article should be higher than 500<br>
ppm, because polymeric mixtures which contain less than 500 ppm of<br>
halogen do not show satisfactory flame retardant properties.<br>
The hypophosphorous acid metal salts appear as white solid powder which<br>
does not melt under the usual processing temperatures of polymers,<br>
therefore it is advisable that the average particle size (D50%) of the powder<br>
is lower than 40 µm and the highest particle size is below 100m, more<br>
preferably D50% should be below 15µm and the highest particle size is<br>
below 30/L/m. The thermoplastic compositions according to the above develop<br>
good flame retardant performances and do not affect the mechanical and<br>
thermal properties of final polymer articles.<br>
Novel thermoplastic moulding compositions of the present invention may also<br>
contain organic compounds which are in a position to form free radicals<br>
during flaming. Said organic compounds, which enable a reduction of the<br><br>
flame retardant composition, can be for example selected among one or<br>
more of the following products: 2,3-dimethyl 2,3-dipheny! butane, 2,3-<br>
dimethyl 2,3-diphenylhexane , poly(1,4-diisopropyl benzene). These<br>
products are generally used in an amount of between 0,01% to 1% w on the<br>
weight of total compound preferably between 0,05% and 0,5% wt.<br>
Still the novel thermoplastic moulded composition may contain a plurality of<br>
conventional products selected among the groups of heat stabilisers, UV<br>
stabilisers, lubricants, mould releasing agents, colorants, antidripping agents,<br>
nucleating agents, antiacid components, etc. more in particular said<br>
additives, used as such or in mixture, may be present in a amount ranging<br>
from 0,5% to 10 % w on the weight of final articles.<br>
Examples of heat stabilisers are sterically hindered phenols and /or aromatic<br>
phosphites or phosphonites and / or thioesters, to be used alone or in<br>
combination and in concentration of up to 1% weight on the weight of<br>
compound.<br>
UV stabilisers which are usually added in an amount of up to 2% weight on<br>
the weight of polymer composition are various benzotriazols, benzophenones<br>
and hindered amines derivatives.<br>
As lubricants and mould releasing agents are preferably long chain fatty acid,<br>
like stearic acid, or fatty acid salts, like sodium, calcium or zinc stearate, or<br>
montan waxes, or one ester or amide obtained by reacting saturated aliphatic<br>
carboxylic acids having from 10 to 40 carbon atoms, preferably from 16 to 22<br>
carbon atoms, with saturated aliphatic alcohols or amines having from 2 to 40<br>
carbon atoms, preferably from 2 to 6 carbon atoms. Such products are used<br>
in an amount of up to 1% wt on the weight of polymeric composition with the<br>
purposes to reduce the shear stresses induced by the mechanical devices on<br>
the organic polymers and to enhance the dispersion of the inorganic<br>
materials in the polymer matrix.<br>
Among colorants the preferred products are the inorganic pigments like, for<br>
example, titanium dioxide, iron oxide, carbon black but can be also be used<br>
other organic pigments like, but not limited to, phthalocyanines,<br><br>
qulnacridones, perylene, nigrosine, anthraquinones.<br>
The moulding composition according to the invention may also comprise from<br>
0 to 1% by weight of fluorine -containing ethylene polymers, which exhibit a<br>
resin melt dropping preventing effect when the composition is fired.<br>
Examples of these fluorine-containing ethylene are: polytetrafluoroethylene<br>
(PTFE) or tetrafluoroethylene-hexafluoropropylene copolymers available in<br>
the market with Algoflon TIM,<br>
Particularly preferred are those fluorine containing polymers with particle size<br>
from 0,1 µm to 10µm.<br>
The flame retardant moulding composition according to the present invention<br>
may further contain one or more antlacid components and nucleating agents<br>
selected among the groups of hydratalcites, zinc oxide, zinc borate,<br>
magnesium carbonate, zinc stannate, sodium benzoate, benzylidene sorbitol,<br>
organo phosphate salts or similar products. Among the above products, Zinc<br>
borate and benzylidene sorbitol are the preferred ones as they improve the<br>
flame retardant performances of the composition.<br>
The thermoplastic moulding composition of the present invention may<br>
optionally comprise a filler.<br>
In the meaning of the present invention, filler can be any fibrous or particulate<br>
substance acting as reinforcement agent.<br>
Example of preferred fibrous fillers are carbon fibers, aramid fibers and,<br>
preferably, glass fibers to be used in the commercial available form of<br>
chopped glass.<br>
In order to improve the compatibility with thermoplastic resins, the fibrous<br>
fillers may previously have been surface treated with a silane compound.<br>
When used the fibrous fillers, their amount should range from 10% to 50%,<br>
preferably from 20% to 35% by weight on the weight of the resin: if the<br>
amount is lower than 10%, no advantage is observed in the mechanical<br>
properties and if the amount is higher than 35% by weight, the viscosity of<br>
the composition will be too high.<br>
Example of particulate substances are glass beads, amorphous silica, chalk,<br><br>
mica, calcinated kaolin, wollastonite, talc, magnesium carbonate, barium<br>
sulfate or similar products and they may have been surface treated with fatty<br>
acids or the like or may have been milled in presence of fatty acids or the<br>
like.<br>
Any particulate substance available into the market as an additive for<br>
thermoplastic resin is suitable for the use in the composition provided that the<br>
average size of the granules is in the range from 2 µm to 20 µm.<br>
When used, the amount of the particulate substance to be added to the resin<br>
composition is up to 30 %, preferably up to 20% by weight on the weight of<br>
resin. If the amount of particulate substance is higher than 30% the melt<br>
viscosity of the composition will be too high and the mouldability of the resin<br>
composition will be poor.<br>
Always according to the present invention, the above products can also be<br>
used in mixture.<br>
Methods for preparing the resin compositions according to the invention are<br>
known per se by mixing and kneading the starting components in the<br>
predetermined ratio as above reported.<br>
Mixing and kneading operations may be effected in any well known device<br>
like banbury mixers, single screw extruders or twin screw extruders and then<br>
extruding them.<br>
it is also possible to premix the starting components with thermoplastic resins<br>
in order to prepare masterbatches which may contain the individual<br>
components or whole additives in a predetermined ratio then dilute them with<br>
additional polymer in an extruder device for producing pellets.<br>
The temperatures at which the components are kneaded are generally<br>
between 160°C and 230°C depending on the chemical nature of the used<br>
polymer.<br>
The extrudates are cooled and pelletised.<br>
The resulting pellets may be moulded into various moldings through injection<br>
moulding devices, blow moulding or injection compression moulding.<br>
The moulding compositions according to the present invention are, for<br><br>
example, suitable for applications in the electrical and electronic sectors such<br>
as parts for office automation appliances, lamp parts, plugs and multipoint<br>
connectors, relay housings, and in building and construction applications<br>
such as pipes.<br>
The invention is described in more detail with reference to the following<br>
examples which, however are not intended to restrict the scope of the<br>
invention<br>
Examples<br>
The components reported in the tables below are compounded in a twin<br>
screw extruder set at temperature between 160°c and 230°C depending on<br>
the chemical nature of the used polymer. After pelletlsatlon and drying the<br>
pellets were injection moulded into test specimens intended to be used for<br>
the fiammability test in accordance to the Underwriters Laboratories<br>
Standards, in particular to the test UL 94 which prescribes:<br>
•	the conditioning of 5 specimens (each formulation and thickness) at 23 °C<br>
and 50% of relative humidity;<br>
•	the positioning of each individual conditioned specimen in vertical position<br>
at about 20 cm from a below cotton flock;<br>
•	2 applications of flame for each specimen {the second application starts<br>
as soon as the specimen ignited by the first application extinguishes).<br>
The UL 94 results have been reported in accordance with the following<br>
meaning also prescribed by the standard:<br>
« V0: when the 5 tested specimens have got total afterburning time no<br>
longer than 50 sec, less than 10 sec each application of the flame, and no<br>
burning drops are allowed.<br>
•	V1: when the 5 tested specimens have got total burning time less than<br>
150 sec, less than 30 sec each application of the flame and no flaming<br>
drops are allowed.<br>
•	V2: when the 5 tested specimens have got total afterburning time of less<br>
than 150 sec, less than 30 sec each application of the flame and flaming<br>
drops are allowed.<br><br>
• When the test results do not meet the above V0, V1 and V2 criteria, no<br>
classification (nc) has been marked in the below tables.<br>
In the following examples the indicated materials were used as started<br>
components:<br>

Results<br><br><br>
The results reported in Table 1 have been obtained utilising, as flame<br>
retardant additives, the hypophosphorous acid metal salt but not the halogen<br>
containing compound, in some cases (see formulations 11-14) instead of the<br>
halogen containing compound, a nitrogen containing compound has been<br>
utilised in quite low amounts. In some formulations (7-14) an additional<br>
organic compound, able to form free radicals during flaming, has been<br>
added. In all the cases, no flame retardant properties have been detected.<br>
The above results show that hypophosphorous acid metal salts with the<br>
nitrogen containing compound, as sole additives as weil as in combination<br>
with free- radical forming compounds, are not effective at all as flame<br>
retardant agents.<br><br><br>
nc= not classified according to UL 94 test<br>
The results reported in Table 2 have been obtained utilising, as flame<br>
retardant additives, the hypophosphorous acid metai salt but not the halogen<br>
containing compound. In all cases instead of the halogen containing<br>
compound, a nitrogen containing compound has been utilised, in quite low<br>
amounts (formulations 1-5) as well as in high amount (formulations 6-7). In<br>
some formulations (1-4) an additional organic compound, able to form free<br>
radicals during flaming, has been added.<br>
As it can be seen, those formulations comprising the above indicated<br>
products and used in combination with melamine cyanurate, are effective at<br>
very high concentration only (table 2, formulations 6 and 7 ).<br>
Therefore the Nitrogen containing products alone, cannot be considered as<br>
essential components according to the scope of the present invention.<br>
Table 3: Flame retardant effectiveness of Phoslite IP-C/melamine hvdrobromicte in unfilled<br>
PP (homo)<br><br>
The results reported in Table 3 have been obtained utilising, as flame<br>
retardant additives, the hypophosphorous acid metal salt and the halogen<br>
containing compound (formulations 1-8), in the presence of an organic<br>
compound, able to form free radicals during flaming. Formulations 2-8 shows<br>
very good results in flame retardant effectiveness. When the<br>
hypophosphorous acid metal salt and the organic compound are not present<br>
(formulations 9-10) the amount of the halogen containing compound must be<br>
very high in order to reach a flame retardant activity. The reduction in the<br><br>
amount of the halogen containing compound and the absence of the<br>
hypophosphorous acid metal salt, results in a complete loss of flame<br>
retardant activity.<br><br>
The results reported in Table 4 have been obtained utilising, as flame<br>
retardant additives, the hypophosphorous acid metal salt and the halogen<br>
containing compound, in the presence of an organic compound (formulations<br>
1-8), able to form free radicals during flaming.<br>
Tables 3 and 4 show the tested formulations based on melamine<br>
hydrobromide and Hypophosphit.es / melamine hydrobromide combinations.<br>
The results show the astonishing flame retardant effectiveness of the<br>
Hypophosphites/ melamine hydrobromide combinations, as matter of the fact<br>
the V2 flammability level is satisfied with almost 1 % w of the mixture based<br>
on Phoslite IP-C/ Melamine hydrobromide, independently from the relative<br>
ratio of components (table 3), and with almost 0,6%w of the mixture based<br>
on Phoslite IP-A / Melamine hydromide (table 4) while it needs almost 6% w<br>
of melamine hydrobromide in order to reach same result ( table 3 ,<br>
formulations 9-11).<br>
In the above mentioned formulations based on Hypophosphites/ melamine<br>
hydrobromide mixtures, the minimum bromine content results to be around<br>
1000 ppm.<br><br>
It has been also found that PhosJtte IP-A is endued with superior<br>
performance than Phoslite IP-C, as a matter of the fact it is even possible to<br>
rank V0 flammability level by adding about 4% w of the Phoslite IP-<br>
A/Melamine hydrobromide (1:1) mixture.<br><br>
Tables 5 and 6 show the flame retardant effectiveness of the indicated<br>
formulations as have been tested in talc filled and glass fiber reinforced PP<br>
articles.<br>
The results show that hypophosphites/ melamine hydrobromide mixtures are<br><br>
effective in talc filled and glass fiber reinforced articles too at the additivation<br>
level ranging from 1% to 2 % w.<br><br>
Table 7 shows the flame retardant effects of hypophosphites / melamine<br>
hydrobromide blends in PP copolymer as it is possible to verify that such<br>
mixtures of products are even suitable for ranking V2 flammabil'rty level with a<br>
total additivation of about 2%w on total weight of the polymer compounds.<br><br>
Table 8 reports flammability test results of PP homopolymer compound<br><br>
made flame retarded with blends of hypophosphites/ organic brominated<br>
products.<br>
According to the above results, V2 fiammability grade is satisfied with an<br>
additivation level of blends of about 0,8% w (Table 8 formulation 6); in this<br>
compound the bromine content is about 600 ppm ( 0,06%w), so that it will<br>
be hardly detectable with usual analytical methods.<br>
As a comparison, the formulation 10, flame retarded with brominated organic<br>
system, needs from 2% to 2,5% wt of bromine for ranking same fiammability<br>
level.<br><br>
Table 9 reports some fiammability test results of PP copolymer compounds<br>
flame retarded with the use of mixtures based on hypophosphites and<br>
organo- brominated compounds. We have found that these blends are<br>
effective in flame proofing PP copolymer articles too.<br><br>
