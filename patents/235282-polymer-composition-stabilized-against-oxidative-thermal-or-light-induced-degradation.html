Stabilization of Synthetic Polymers<br>
The present invention relates to compositions comprising a synthetic polymer subject to oxi¬dative, thermal or light-induced degradation, especially polyolefins, polyether polyol or poly-urethane, and as stabilizer a specific group of compounds of the benzofuran-2-on6 type.<br>
The use of compounds of the benzofuran-2-one type as stabilizers for synthetic polymers is known, for example, from WO-A-80/01566 or US 5,516,920.<br>
The known stabilizers do not satisfy in every respect the high requirements which a stabilizer is required to meet, especially with regard to shelf life, water absorption, sensitivity to hydro¬lysis, in-process stabilization, color properties, volatility, migration behaviour, compatibility apd improvement in protection against light. As a result there continues to be a need for effective stabilizers for synthetic polymers that are sensitive to oxidative, thermal and/or light-induced degradation.<br>
EP-A-0 871 066 discloses the use of a specific group of compounds of the benzofuran-2-one type as DOX scavengers in color photographic materiais.<br>
It has now been found that a specific group of compounds of the benzofuran-2-one type disclosed in EP-A-0 871 066 is particularly suitable as a stabilizer for synthetic polymers which are sensitive to oxidative, thermal or light-induced degradation.<br>
The present invention therefore provides composiUons comprising<br>
a)	a synthetic polymer subject to oxidative, thermal or light-induced degradation, and<br>
b)	at least a compound of the formula 1<br><br><br>
R, and R2 are each independently of one another hydrogen or C1-C6alkyI, R3 and R4 are each independently of one another CrCijalkyl, and R5 is C1-C7alkyl.<br>
Alkyl having up to 12 carbon atoms is a branched or unbranched radical, for example methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, seC1-butyi, isobutyl, tert-butyl, 2-ethylbutyl, n-pentyl, isopentyl, 1-methylpentyl, 1,3-dimethylbutyl, n-hexyl, 1-methylhexyl, n-heptyl, isoheptyl, 1,1,3,3-tetra-methylbuty! (tert-octyl), 1-methylheptyl, 3-methylheptyl, n-octyl, 2-ethylhexy!, 1,1,3-trimethyi-hexyi, 1,1,3,3-tetramethylpentyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, 1-methylundecyl or dodecyt. One of the preferred definitions for Ri and R2 is, for example, C1-C6alkyI, especially C1-C6lkyl, e.g. tert-butyl. Preferably, R3 and R4 are C4-C12alkyl, especially C4-C10alkyl, e.g. C6alkyl. A pre¬ferred definition of R5 is C1-C4alkyl, especially d-Cgalkyl, e.g. methyl.<br>
Preferred compounds of the formula I are those wherein<br>
R, and R2 are each independently of one another hydrogen or C1-C4alkyl,<br>
R3 and R4 are each independently 0I one anotiier C4-C10alkyl, and<br>
R5 is C1-C4alkyl.<br>
Further preferred compounds of the formula I are those wherein R3 and R4 are tert-octyl.<br>
01 special interest is the compound of the formula 1 wherein Ri and Ra are hydrogen, R3 and R4 are tert-octyl, and R5 is methyl.<br>
The synthesis of the compounds of the formula 1 is for example disclosed in EP-A-0 871 066.<br>
The compounds of the formula 1 are suitable for stabilizing synthetic polymers against oxida¬tive, thermal or light-induced degradation.<br>

a)	radical polymerisation (normally under high pressure and at elevated temperature).<br>
b)	catalytic polymerisation using a catalyst that normally contains one or more than one metal of groups IVb, Vb, VIb or VIII of the Periodic Table.

The synthetic polymers to be protected are preferably thermoplastic polymers, especially polyolefins, polyether polyols or polyurethanes, in particular polyethylene and polypropylene or copolymers thereof with mono- and diolefins.<br>
The compounds of the formula I are likewise used for polyurethane production, especially for preparing flexible polyurethane foams. In this context the novercomposltions and the pro¬ducts produced therefrom are effectively protected against degradation. In particular, scor¬ching during foam production is avoided. Polyurethane foamers may post-add phospites as plaslicizers such as diphenyl isodecyl phosphite (DPDP), phenyl diisodecyl phosphite (PDDP)"to the base stabilized polyether polyols at the mixing head prior to the foaming in relative high concentrations (up to 1.5 % by weight based on the polyether polyol). In the presence of this high amount of phosphites the formed polyurethane foams show ar •    '-<br><br>
sired discoloration (pinking and/or yellowing). However, in the presence of the compounds of the formula I the polyurethane foams are white.<br>
The polyurethanes are obtained, for example, by reacting polyethers, polyesters and poly-butadienes which contain terminal hydroxyi groups with aliphatic or aromatic polyisocya-nates.<br>
Polyethers having terminal hydroxyi groups are known and are prepared, for example, by polymerizing epoxides such as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide, tetrahydro-furan, styrene oxide or epichlorohydrin with themselves, for example in the presence of BF3, or by addition reaction of these epoxides, alone or as a mixture or in succession, with star¬ting components containing reactive hydrogen atoms, such as water, alcohols, ammonia or amines, tor example ethylene glycol, propylene 1,3- and 1,2-glycol, trimethyloipropane, 4,4'-dlhydroxydiphenyipropane, aniline, ethanolamine or ethylenediamine. Sucrose polyethers are also suitable in accordance with the invention. In many cases preference is given to those polyethers which predominantly (up to 90% by weight, based on all the OH groups present in the polyether) contain primary OH groups. Furthermore, polyethers modified by vinyl polymers, as are formed, for example, by polymerizing styrepe and acrylonitrile in the presence of polyethers, are suitable, as are polybutadienes containing OH groups.<br>
These compounds generally have molecular weights of 40 and are polyhydroxy compounds, especially compounds containing from two to eight hydroxyi groups, especially those of molecular weight from 800 to 10 000, preferably from 1000 to 6000, for example polyethers containing at least 2, generally 2 to 8, but preferably 2 to 4, hydroxyi groups, as are known for the preparation of homogeneous polyurethanes and cellular polyurethanes.<br>
It is of course possible to employ mixtures of the above compounds containing at least two isocyanate-reactive hydrogen atoms, in particular with a molecular weight of 400 - 1Q 000.<br>
Suitable polyisocyanates are aliphatic, cyctoaliphatic, araliphatic, aromatic and heterocyclic polyisocyanates, for example ethylene diisocyanate, 1,4-tetramethylene diisocyanate, 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate, 1,12-dodecane diisocyanate, cyclobutane 1,3-diisocyanat6, cyclohexane 1,3- and -1,4-diisocyanate and also any desired mixtures of these isomers, 1-isocyanato-3,3,5-trimethy!-5-isocyanatomethylcyclohexane, 2,4-. arid 2,6-hexahydrotolylene<br><br>
diisocyanate and also any desired mixtures of these isomers, hexahydro-1,3- and/or -1,4-phenylene diisocyanate, perhydro-2,4'- and/or -4,4'-diphenylmethanedilsocyanate, 1,3- and 1,4-phenylene diisocyanate, 2,4- and 2,6-tolylene diisocyanate, and also any desired mix¬tures of these isomers, diphenylmethane 2,4'- and/or -4,4'-diisocyanate, naphthylene 1,5-diisocyanate, triphenylmethane 4,4',4"-triisocyanate, polyphenyl-polymethylene polyisocya¬nates as are obtained by aniline-formaldehyde condensation followed by phosgenization, m-and p-isocyanatophenylsulfonyl isocyanates, perch(orinafed aryl polyisocyanates, polyiso¬cyanates containing carbodiimide groups, polyisocyanates containing aKophanate groups, polyisocyanates containing- isocyanurate groups, polyisocyanates containing urethane groups, polyisocyanates containing acylated urea groups, poiyisocyanates containing biuret groups, polyisocyanates containing ester groups, reaction products of the abovementioned isocyanates with acetals, and polyisocyanates containing polymeric fatty acid radicals.<br>
If is also possible to employ the isocyanate group-containing distillation residues, 'as they are or dissolved in one or more of the abovementioned polyisocyanates, which are obtained in the course of the industrial preparation of isocyanates. It is additionally possible to use any desired mixtures of the abovementioned polyisocyanates.<br>
Particular preference is given in general to the polyisocyanates which are readily obtainable industrially, for example 2,4- and 2,6-tolyiene diisocyanate and any desired mixtures of these isomers ("TDI"), polyphenyl-polymethylene-polyisocyanates as prepared by aniline-formalde¬hyde condensation followed by phosgenization {"crude MDI"), and polyisocyanates contai¬ning carbodiimide, urethane, allophanate, isocyanurate, urea or biuret groups ("modified polyisocyanates").<br>
Particular emphasis is to be placed on the action of the compounds of the formula I against thermal and oxidative degradation, especially under thermal stress as occurs during the pro¬cessing of thermoplastics. The compounds of the formula I are therefore outstandingly sui¬table for use as in-process stabilizers.<br>
The compounds of the formula I.are preferably added to the synthetic polymer to be stabi¬lized in an amount of from 0.0005 to 10 %, in particular from 0.001 to 2 %, for example from 0.01 to 2 %, based on the weight of the synthetic polymer to be stabilized.<br><br>
In addition to components (a) and (b) the novel compositions may comprise further costabiii-zers (additives) such as, for example, the following:<br>

As a conventional stabilizer combination for processing synthetic polymers, for example po¬lyolefins, to form corresponding mouldings, the combination of a phenolic antioxidant with a secondary antioxidant based on an organic phosphite or phosphonite is recommended. De¬pending on the particular substrate and process, however, many polyolefin processors are forced to operate processes in the high-temperature region above about 280°C. By virtue of the incorporation of the compounds of the formula 1, which Is specially suitable for high-tem¬perature applications, in particular in the temperature range above 300°C, industrial mate¬rials and mouldings, based for.instance on high-density polyethylene, for example pipes and their technical variants (fittings), can be produced at a greater rate and with fewer rejects. Another advantage of the compounds of the formula I is that it can be employed in very<br><br>
small amounts. This leads to a reduction in the overall concentration of antioxidant relative to conventional stabilizer mixtures. Thus the use of a low concentration of the compounds of the formula I allow/s a reduction in the overall concentration of stabilizer by about a third in polyolefins, ior example, which simultaneously represent an economic advantage. ■<br>
Incorporation of the compounds of the formula I and, if desired, further additives into the syn--thetic polymers is carried out by known methods, for example before or during moulding or else by applying the dissolved or dispersed compounds to the synthetic polymer, if appro¬priate with subsequent slow evaporation of the solvent. The compounds of the formula I can also be added to the synthetic polymers to be stabilized in the form of a masterbatch contai¬ning them, for example, in a concentration of 2.5 to 25% by weight.<br>
The compounds of the formula I can also be added before or during polymerisation or before crosslinklng.<br>
The compounds of the formula I, with or without further additives, can be incorporated in pure form or encapsulated in waxes, oiis or polymers into the synthetic polymer that is to be stabilized.<br>
The compounds of the formula I, with or without further additives, can also be sprayed onto the synthetic polymer that is to be stabilized. It is able to dilute other additives (for example the conventional additives indicated atiove) or their melts so that they too can be sprayed together with these additives onto the polymer that is to be stabilized. Addition by spraying on during the deactivation of the polymerization catalysts Is particularly advantageous, it being possible to carry out spraying using, for example, the steam used for deactivation.<br>
In the case o1 spherically polymerized polyolefins it may, for example, be advantageous to apply the compounds of the formula I, with or without other additives, by spraying.<br>
The materials stabilized in this way can be employed in a wide variety of forms, for example as foams, films, fibres, tapes, moulding compositions, as profiles or as binders for coating materials, especially powder coatings, adhesives or putties.<br><br>
The polyolefins stabilized in this way can likewise be employed in a wide variety of forms, especially as thick-layer polyolefin mouldings which are in long-term contact with extractive media, such as, for example, pipes for liquids or gases, films, fibres, geomembranes, tapes, profiles or tanks.<br>
The preferred thick-layer polyolefin mouldings have a layer thickness of from 1 to 50 mm, in particular from 1 to 30 mm, for example from 2 to 10 mm.<br>
As already mentioned, thermoplastic polymers are protected with particular advantage. Attention should be drawn above all in this context to the outstanding activity of the com¬pounds of the formula i as in-process stabilizer (heat stabilizer). For this purpose the com¬pounds of the formula 1 are advantageously added to the synthetic polymer prior to or during its processing. However, other polymers too (for example elastomers) or lubricants or hy-d'raulic fluids can be stabilized against degradation, for example light-induced or thermooxi-dative degradation. Elastomers can be taken from the above listing of possible synthetic polymers.<br>
The lubricants and hydraulic fluids in question are based, for example, on mineral oils or synthetic oils or on mixtures thereof. The lubricants are familiar to the skilled person in the art and are described in the relevant technical literature, for example in Dieter Klamann, "Schmierstoffe und verwandte Produkte" (Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, 1982), in Schewe-Kobek, "Das Schmiermittel-Taschenbuch" (Dr. Alfred Huthig-Verlag, Heidelberg, 1974) and in "Ullmanns Enzyklopadie der technischen Chemie", Vol.13, pages 85-94 (Verlag Chenrie, Weinheim, 1977).<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for stabilizing a synthetic polymer against oxidative, thermal or light-induced degradation, which comprises incorporating therein or applying thereto at least a compound of the formula I.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention is therefore the use of the compounds of the formula I as stabilizers, especially in-process stabilizer (thermal stabilizer), for synthetic polymers, especially thermoplastic polymers, against oxidative, thermal or light-induced de¬gradation.<br><br>
The examples which follow illustrate the invention in more detail. Parts and percentages are by weight.<br>
Example 1: Preparation of polyether/polyurethane soft foams as well as the stabilization thereof.<br>
2 g (0.025 %, based on the poiyol) of a stabilizer according to Table 1 is dissolved in 8 kg of a polyether poiyol, Lupranol 2045 (RTM) (trifunctional polyetfier poiyol having phmary hydroxy} groups; hydroxy! number 35 mg KOH/g, water content less than 0.1 %, acid number less than 0.1 mg KOH/g) which contains 6 g of Irganox 5057 (RTM) [see footnote c) at the end of Table 2] and 4 g of Irganox 1135 (RTM) [see footnote d) at the end of Table 2]. 520 g of a solution consisting of 120 g Tecostab (RTM) (polysilicone supplied by Goldschmidt, Ger¬many], and 6.4 g diazabicyclooctane (amine catalyst) are added and the reaction mixture is stirred vigorously for 60 seconds at 100 rpm. 14.4 g of tin octoate and 120 g (1.5 %, based on the poiyol) of diphenyl isodecy! phosphite (DPDP) is then added and the reaction mixture is again stirred vigorously for 60 seconds at 100 rpm. With vigorous stirring, 5.11 kg of an isocyanate [Lupranat TSO (RTM), supplied by BASF; toluylene-2,4- and toluyien6-2,6-diiso-cyanate mixture] are then added immediately and the mixture is poured into a lined mould and the exothermic temperature is measured during foaming to a foam block. The foam blocks are cooled and stored at room temperature for 24 hours. The next day the foams are cut. The color of the foam blocks is determined visually. The whiter the foam the better is the foam stabilized, it has to be noted ttiat this effect is oniy visible on iarge foaming scale (for example 1 m foam. The obsen/atlon of this effect Is difficult on a lab scale. The results are summarized in Table 1.<br><br><br>
Example 2: Preparation of ABS (Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-Styrene) as well as the stabilization thereof.<br>
833g of Acrytonitrile-butadiene-styrene graft polymer [Baymod 60A (RTM), Bayer Corp.], 1667g of styrene-acrylonitriie copolymer [Luslran 32 (RTM), Bayer Corp.], 26.25 g of N,N'-etfiytenedi(stearamide), 1.496g of Irganox 1076 [(RTM), n-octadecyl 3-[3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl]propionate, 0,057% based on polymer], 2.993 g of Irgafos 168 [(RTM), tris-(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyJ) phosphite, 0.113% based on polymer] and 0.788 g of a'stabilizer according to Table 2 (0,030% based on polymer) were mixed together on a tumbling barrel mixer dunng 15 hours. The resulting dry-blend was then compounded on twin-screw-extru¬der (Berstorff 46D, at 220°C, 110 rpm and 12 kg/h) and, after drying for 3h at 80°C, injection molded on an Engel HL65 Injection Molder at 2400 (cycle time: 35,8 s; injection speed: 25 mm/s; mold temperature: GCC) to give natural ABS plaques of the dimension 67 x 64 x 2 mm.<br>
The initial color of these ABS plaques was measured, then the plaques were exposed to ac¬celerated weathering in a Weather-0-Meter ATLAS Ci 65 for 1000 hours under the following conditions: Irradiation 0.35 W/m at 340nm; Borosilicate inner and outer filter; Black Panel Temperature: 63°C; no dark phase; 60% relative humidity and dry cycle (no rain). The yel¬lowness index (Yl) is determined according to DIN 6167. Low Yl values denote little discolo¬ration, high Yl values high discoloration of the samples. The less discoloration, the more effective the stabilizer. The results are summarized in Table 2.<br><br><br>
