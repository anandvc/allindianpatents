THE PATENTS ACT 1970<br>
[39 OF 1970]<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10 and rule 13]<br>
"BIOCIDAL CLEANING COMPOSITION"<br>
SELDEN   RESEARCH   LTD,   a  British   company  of Ashbourne   Road, Buxton, Derbyshire SK I7 9RZ, United Kingdom,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
Biocidal cleaninq composition<br>
The invention relates to biocidal cleaning compositions and more particularly but not exclusively to mild liquid formulations having utility in the manuaf cleaning and sanitising of dishes and hard surfaces.<br>
There   exists   a   continuing   need   for   mild   surfactants   suitable<br>
particularly for manual dishwashing  and other light duty hard surface<br>
. cleaning applications, and such products have been the subjects of much<br>
prior art.  	<br>
These products have generally comprised anionic and non-ionic surfactant-blends conferring on them good foaming and drain drying properties so that crockery and glassware are rendered sparkling clean and streak free.<br>
, Furthermore, since the world's population is now more hygiene conscious than ever before it is desirable to produce a composition; which in addition to cleaning properties, also possesses antibacterial properties, and. as such is suitable for sanitising hard surfaces, floors,, walls  work surfaces and the like, especially in catering, food processing and health and hygiene situations where major.health problems can arise due to the growth and spread of pathogenic bacteria.<br>
These products have generally combined non-tonic surfactants with cationic biocides and/or organic halides often with higher alcohol co-solvents and chelating agents. They tend to be characterised by having<br><br>
relatively low foam and whilst they may have good grease removal, they are unsuitable for use in manual dishwashing applications as" crockery "and glassware are left with residual streaks and smears.<br>
Previous attempts, to combine both dishwashing and sanitising have met with limited success due to the incompatibility of anionic surfactants ..    withcationic biocides such that their biocidal effectiveness has been much reduced.   The use of organic halides or other biocides 'compatible with anionic surfactants has had limited success due to. their ineffectiveness at high diiutions  Recent attempts to overcome these  constraints have resulted in. formulations having good dishwashing properties at normal use dilutions with biocidal properties When used neat or virtually neat.<br>
Certain groups of non-ionic surfactants particularly those based on sugars and vegetable oils for example alkyl poiyglycbsides (also known as alkyl"p6Iygfu.cpsides and hereinaftef referred to as APG's) are fhild to the skin  and have good foaming  arid rinsing properties.     Moreover their ,■ detergericy may be potentiated by combination with amphoteric surfactants. • It is also known that they are compatible with some catibnic surfactants. ■This has been utilised in the formulation of for example mouthwashes and skin and hair cleansers.<br>
International Patent Application Nos. 94/05753  95/31962 nd European Patent Application No, 0911022A1 all teach of the use of APG's' in such compositions.<br><br>
APG'S have also been used as additives in manual dishwashing formulations to confer mildness usually in conjunction with anionic surfactants such as alkyl benzene sulphonate or sodium lauryl sulfate. The use of cationic biocides or biguanides in mouthwashes and skin cleansers and for example, surgical scrubs are also well known in the prior art and is described in US Patents Nos. 4022834 and 5719113.<br>
However, the combination . of sugar surfactants, amphoteric ■surfactants and quaternary biocides, or biguanides has hot been previously applied to the production of a dishwashing composition having effective biocidal properties, at normal use dilution.<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invejition is. to provide a high performance surfactant solution with superior manual dish and glasswashing properties which also exhibits biocidal properties effective at normal use dilutions and is suitable for light duty hard surface cleaning/sanitising applications.<br>
According to the present invention therefore, there is provided a biocidal cleaning composition comprising a biocide, a surfactant of formula 1 and an amphoteric surfactant.<br><br>
Formula I<br>
R-0-(G}n wherein; R = alkyl (C4 - C24),<br>
G = saccharide residue having 5 or 6 Carbon atoms,<br>
n = a number from 0,4 to 10.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the biocide is water<br>
soluble, typically^ has some cationic properties and is normally either a<br>
biguanide or a quaternary ammonium compound. Suitable biguanides are<br>
.. referred	to.-.in   US; .patentiiNos.   3,468,898 : and. 4,022,834  and  are<br>
preferentially either a salt of chlorhexidine or polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB}, as exemplified in formula II. ChJbmexidine is the common name for the antiseptic 1,1/-hexamethyJene-bis-[-5-(4-chrofophenyl)-biguanide].<br>
Formula II<br><br>
wherein; HX is a salt forming anion<br>
n is a No. between 4 and 50, but preferably 12. Suitable quaternary ammonium biocides are of formula 111.<br><br><br>
Where R1 is selected from an alkyl group having 6 to 24 carbon atoms or aromatic, aryl or alkaryl groups having 6 to 24 carbon atoms; R2, R3 and R4 are independently selected from hydrogen, an alkyl group having 1 to 24 carbon atoms, or aromatic, aryl or alkyaryl groups having from 6 to 24 carbon atoms X is. an anion selected from but not limited to chloride, bromide, iodide, acetate, phosphate, nitrate, sulphate, lactate, citrate, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Th glycolate, saccharinate e biocide.may constitute from 0.1% to<br>
10% of the composition.  Preferably  the biocide of the present invention<br>
shall constitute from 0.2% to 5% of the composition.   Most preferably, the<br>
biocide of the present invention shall constitute; from 0.5% to 2% of the<br>
composition. ...<br>
The non-ionic surfactant, in accordance with formula I, is an APG. Suitable APG's. have been described in US Patent No.s 3839318, 3772269, 3707535 and 3547828 afso in German and European patents and are commercially produced by reacting glucose or oligosaccharides with alcohols containing from 4 to 24 carbon atoms under acid catalysis.<br><br>
With higher alcohols high  reaction temperatures' and prolonged reaction times result in complex mixtures of mono-, di-, tri- and oligosaccharides and reference to APG's shall include complex mixtures as described.<br>
A particular property of APG's is that although being formally classified as non-ionic surfactants they do exhibit very slight anionic behaviour. The APG's of the present Invention may constitute from 5% to 35% of the composition. Preferably, the APG's of the present invention shall constitute from 10% .to 20%o the composition-    <br>
  If is well known in the art that amphoteric surfactants (also known as zwitteribnic surfactants) show synergistic interactions with anionic surfactants.<br>
The present invention utilises, a non-ionic surfactant with very mild anionic properties and the use of an amphoteric surfactant has been shown to improve the cleaning performance of APG's (Henkel sales brochure on their GlUcopon range in April  1996).     Since most classes of amphoteric surfactant are broadly compatible with the aforesaid  biocides the nature of the amphoteric surfactant suitable for use in the  present invention is not limited.  Although the amphoteric surfactant may originate from a wide variety of sources those most suitable are derived from secondary and tertiary amines wherein the alkyl groups can be straight or branched alkyl chains  between  1   and 22 carbon  atoms  long  and may contain  other<br><br>
functional groups, for example amido groups. Preferably the nitrogen of the amphoteric surfactant of the present invention shall be in a cationic state wherein, the number of cations present in the molecule shall not be limited. At least one of the alky  groups must contain an. ionisable head group which' can adopt a negative charge such as a carboxylase, sulphate, sulphonate, phosphate phosphonate, succinate, or sulfosuccinate.<br>
Preferably, the amphoteric surfactants shall be chosen from betaines, sultaines  hydroxysultaihes, iminopropionates and imihodipropionates <br>
 The amphoteric surfactant  shall preferably  constitute, from 2%. to. 20%. of the composition and advantageously from 5% to 15% of the composition.<br>
 The  aforesaid  constituents,   (hereinafter referred to' as the  key formula) form the basis'of the invention providing both washing ability and' antibacterial activity; however, in order to optimise the  performance of the present invention additional constituents may be added.   Preferably, a non-iohic  foam  booster shall  be  added  to the  key formula: for example, alkanoiamides and amine oxides; for example alkyl amine oxides and ethoxylated amine oxides such' as those available under the Aromox (RTM) range from Akzo Nobel Chemicals.  The addition of these foam boosters has no detrimental effect on the biocidai efficacy of the present invention.<br>
The foam booster may be added to the key formula in proportions not exceeding 10% of the composition.<br><br>
Preferably, the foam booster, shall be added to the key formula in proportions from 2% to 6% of the composition.<br>
These classes of nitrogen containing nonionic surfactants are well known to show synergistic and foam boosting effects when used in conjunction with anionic surfactants. It has been found that they exhibit similar beneficial effects when used in conjunction with the mildly anionic APG's.<br>
Preferably, anionic surfactants shall be added to the key formula in order.to. influence the. feel  rinsing and foaming properties and without markedly reducing the bactericidal efficiency of the invention.. The nature of the anionic surfactant is limited only by its compatibility with the key formula suitable anionic surfactants include sodium lauryi sulfate, sodium lauryi ether sulfate and sodium lauryi sarcosinate;'<br>
The aforesaid, anionic surfactants may be tolerated by the key formula in proportions not exceeding 1 % of the total.<br>
 Preferably, minor amounts of specific nonionic surfactants may be added to the key formula in order to improve grease removal. Suitable non-ionic surfactants include alcohol alkoxylates and alky phenol alkoxylates. Preferably, the non-ionic surfactants shall be an alchohol ethoxylate having a cloud point below 20°C according to DIN 53917. The non-ionic surfactant may be included in the key formula In proportions not exceeding 10%.<br>
Preferably, the non-ionic surfactant shall be included  in the key<br><br>
formula  in proportions not exceeding 5% of the total.<br>
Advantageously, the non-ionic surfactant shall be included in the key formula in proportions between 1% and 3% of the total.<br>
The pH of the composition shall be between 5 and 9, and may be adjusted by the additions of small amounts of acid or base.   .<br>
Preferably, the pH of the composition shall be between 6 and 8. The acid employed to adjust the pH of the composition is not limited but   preferably   shall   be   chosen from...sulfamic    citric    hydrochloric, phosphoric, nitric, lactic, formic, acetic or gluconic but other mineral or organic acids may be used without detriment. ..<br>
The base employed to adjust the pH of the composition is not limited but preferably shall be chosen from sodium or potassium hydroxide and mono-, di- or tri- ethanolamine but other bases may be used without detriment.<br>
Furthermore, additional constituents may be added to the key formula including   sequesterants,  thickeners,  perfurme,   dye, and  preservative. Careful selection of these ingredients is required since their inclusion is limited only by their compatability with the key formula.<br>
The aforesaid additional constituents may be added to the key formula in proportions not exceeding 3% and.preferably, not exceeding 1%. It.should be noted that common co'mmercia! detergents for manual dishwashing typically contain between  15% and 40% total surfactant <br><br>
content and the guideline inclusion rates described above are relevant to those typical detergent strengths. However, it is possible to manufacture very weak or very strong detergent solutions and any limits described above should be amended accordingly for such detergents.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention is not based on petroleum' derived stocks but rather on renewable resources such as coconuts/palm kernafs and vegetable starch, and is therefore significantly more environmentally friendly both in terms ofbibdegradability and sustainability <br>
It is to be understood,that all percentage values are measured. by. weight, and are relative to the total composition, unless otherWise stated. This invention will now be described further by reference to the following specific examples"-<br><br>
