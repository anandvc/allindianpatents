TRANSMISSION HAVING RESIN BLOCK BELT<br>
This application claims priority from Japanese<br>
Patent Application No. 2007-016489 filed on January 26,<br>
2007.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a motorcycle<br>
including a belt type continuously variable transmission<br>
having a resin block belt.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
There has been provided a motorcycle including a<br>
belt type continuously variable transmission (for<br>
example, see JP-A-2002-147582).<br>
A belt type continuously variable transmission<br>
includes a primary sheave, a secondary sheave, and a<br>
V-belt wound around the primary sheave and the secondary<br>
sheave. A driving force of a crankshaft of an engine is<br>
transmitted in order of the primary sheave, the V-belt,<br>
and the secondary sheave. The driving force is<br>
transmitted to a driving wheel after a speed is changed.<br>
The primary sheave, the V-belt, and the secondary sheave<br>
are housed inside the transmission casing. That is, a<br>
1<br><br>
belt chamber is formed inside the transmission casing,<br>
and the primary sheave, the V-belt, and the secondary<br>
sheave are housed in the belt chamber.<br>
In the motorcycle disclosed in JP-A-2002-147582,<br>
a resin block belt is used in the view of improving a<br>
durability of the V-belt and preventing heat generation<br>
due to deformation. The resin block belt includes a<br>
large number of resin blocks, and coupling members for<br>
coupling those resin blocks together. However, because<br>
the resin blocks are separated from each other, the resin<br>
blocks tend to collide with each other while the V-belt<br>
is running. Therefore, the resin block belt tends to<br>
cause more noise comparing with a rubber belt.<br>
In consideration of the problem, JP-A-2002-147582<br>
suggests that a sound absorption material be disposed<br>
on an inner surface of the transmission casing for<br>
accommodating the resin block belt for the purpose of<br>
preventing noise.<br>
On the other hand, the V-belt runs at a high speed,<br>
and the primary sheave and the secondary sheave rotate<br>
at high speeds. Therefore, it is necessary to dispose<br>
the sound absorption material not to contact with the<br>
V-belt and both the sheaves. In other words, it is<br>
necessary to dispose the sound absorption material<br>
mentioned above at a position with a certain distance<br>
2<br><br>
away from the V-belt and both the sheaves. Therefore,<br>
if the sound absorption material is disposed on the inner<br>
surface of the transmission casing as in the motorcycle<br>
disclosed in JP-A-2002-147582, a space for the sound<br>
absorption material needs to be provided inside the<br>
transmission casing in advance. However, a volume of the<br>
belt chamber becomes large if an extra space for the sound<br>
absorption material is provided inside the transmission<br>
casing. Therefore, the motorcycle disclosed in<br>
JP-A-2002-147582 has a problem that the belt type<br>
continuously variable transmission itself tends to<br>
become large in size.<br>
Normally, a sound absorption material also has a<br>
thermal insulation function. Therefore, a temperature<br>
inside the belt chamber is apt to rise in the motorcycle<br>
disclosed in JP-A-2002-147 582 because the sound<br>
absorption material is provided on the inner surface of<br>
the transmission casing. Thus, there is a problem that<br>
a durability of the resin block belt lowers due to a<br>
temperature increase in the belt chamber.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is made in consideration of<br>
the foregoing problem. The object of the invention is<br>
to provide a noise preventing means suitable for a<br>
3<br><br>
motorcycle including a belt type continuously variable<br>
transmission having a resin block belt.<br>
The inventors of the present invention had a careful<br>
research to achieve the above object. We figured out<br>
that noise produced in a belt type continuously variable<br>
transmission having a resin block belt is mostly pitch<br>
noise caused due to motions of a plurality of resin blocks<br>
running one after another, and the pitch noise is a<br>
so-called high frequency sound. We noticed that a high<br>
frequency sound generally has characteristics of high<br>
linearity and weak transmission.<br>
With such a research on causes of noise, the<br>
inventors of the present application examined on the<br>
relationship between an air passage for cooling a belt<br>
chamber and reduction of high frequency sounds, and made<br>
the invention hereinafter.<br>
The aspects of the present invention is directed<br>
to a motorcycle, including: an engine unit having a<br>
transmission casing in which a belt chamber is formed,<br>
and a belt type continuously variable transmission housed<br>
in the belt chamber and having a resin block belt; a frame<br>
member disposed more rearward than or above the<br>
transmission casing, extending in a vertical direction<br>
or an obliquely upward and downward directions, and<br>
supporting at least a part of the engine unit; and an<br>
4<br><br>
air passage connected to the transmission casing, and<br>
constructed with an intake passage for inducting air into<br>
the belt chamber or an exhaust passage for discharging<br>
air from the belt chamber, in which the air passage<br>
extends rearward from the transmission casing passing<br>
over the frame member in a side view, and has a curving<br>
part curving at a part around the frame member.<br>
The air passage of the motorcycle extends rearward<br>
from the transmission casing passing over the frame<br>
member, and is a long air passage. Therefore, noise of<br>
the belt type continuously variable transmission<br>
occurred in the belt chamber is damped inside the air<br>
passage before it reaches outside. Consequently, noise<br>
released outside from the air passage is reduced to a<br>
relatively small sound. The air passage has the curving<br>
part curving at a part around the frame member. Thereby,<br>
an interruption between the air passage and the frame<br>
member can be prevented, and a linear travel of a high<br>
frequency sound, which has a high tendency of linear<br>
traveling, can be prevented. Accordingly, the<br>
motorcycle can effectively prevents a high frequency<br>
sound that is considered to be a major cause of noise.<br>
Therefore, the motorcycle can effectively prevent noise<br>
caused by the resin block belt.<br>
The present invention can provide a noise<br>
5<br><br>
preventing means suitable for the motorcycle including<br>
a belt type continuously variable transmission having<br>
a resin block belt.<br>

34	is mounted on the left side of a front half part of<br>
the first case block 20a. The transmission casing 36 for<br>
accommodating the CVT 17 is mounted on the right side<br>
of the second case block 20b. An opening is formed on<br>
the right side of a rear half part of the second case<br>
15<br><br>
block 20b. This opening is blocked by a clutch cover 37.<br>
The transmission casing 36 is formed independently<br>
from the crankcase 20, and is constructed with an inner<br>
case 36a for covering an inner part (a left part) of the<br>
CVT in the vehicle width direction and an outer case 36b<br>
for covering an outer part (a right part) of the CVT 17<br>
in the vehicle width direction. The inner case 36a is<br>
mounted on the right side of the crankcase 20. The outer<br>
case 36b is mounted on the right side of the inner case<br>
36a. A belt chamber 38 for accommodating the CVT 17 is<br>
formed in a space formed between the inner case 36a and<br>
the outer case 36b. An intake opening 78 is formed on<br>
a top surface of the outer case 36b. The intake duct 71<br>
mentioned above (see FIGs. 1 and 3) is connected to the<br>
intake opening 78.<br>
A right end of the crankshaft 23 passes through the<br>
second case block 20b and the inner case 36a, and extends<br>
to the belt chamber 38. A primary sheave 51 of the CVT<br>
17 is fitted in the right end of the crankshaft 23.<br>
Therefore, the primary sheave 51 rotates following a<br>
rotation of the crankshaft 23. This right part of the<br>
crankshaft 23 (strictly, a part more rightward than the<br>
bearing 24b) forms a primary sheave shaft 23a.<br>
Meanwhile, a left end of the crankshaft 23 passes<br>
through the first case block 20a, and extends into the<br>
16<br><br>
generator case 35. The generator 34 is mounted at this<br>
left end of the crankshaft 23. The generator 34 includes<br>
a stator 34a and a rotor 34b facing the stator 34a. The<br>
rotor 34b is fixed to a sleeve 39 rotating together with<br>
the crankshaft 23. The stator 34a is fixed to the<br>
generator case 35.<br>
A secondary sheave shaft 53 in which a secondary<br>
sheave 52 is fitted is disposed parallel to the crankshaft<br>
23 in a rear half part in the crankcase 20. A right part<br>
of a center part of the secondary sheave shaft 53 is<br>
supported by the clutch cover 37 via a bearing 54a. A<br>
left part of the secondary sheave shaft 53 is supported<br>
by a left end of the second case block 20b via a bearing<br>
54b. The secondary sheave 52 is coupled to a right end<br>
of the secondary sheave shaft 53.<br>
The CVT 17 includes the primary sheave 51, the<br>
secondary sheave 52, and a V-belt 55 wound around the<br>
primary sheave 51 and the secondary sheave 52. As<br>
mentioned above, the primary sheave 51 is mounted on the<br>
right side of the crankshaft 23. The secondary sheave<br>
52 is coupled to a right part of the secondary sheave<br>
shaft 53.<br>
The primary sheave 51 includes a fixed sheave half<br>
body 51a positioned outside in the vehicle width<br>
direction, a movable sheave half body 51b positioned<br>
17<br><br>
inside in the vehicle width direction and facing the fixed<br>
sheave half body 51a. The fixed sheave half body 51a is<br>
fixed to a right part of the primary sheave shaft 23a,<br>
and rotates together with the primary sheave 23a. The<br>
movable sheave half body 51b is disposed on the left side<br>
of the fixed sheave half body 51a, and slidably mounted<br>
on the primary sheave shaft 23a. Therefore, the movable<br>
sheave half body 51b rotates together with the primary<br>
sheave 23a, and is slidable in the axis direction of the<br>
primary sheave shaft 23a. A belt groove 51c is formed<br>
between the fixed sheave half body 51a and the movable<br>
sheave half body 51b. A cam surface 56 is formed on the<br>
left side of the movable sheave half body 51b. A cam plate<br>
57 is disposed on the left side of the cam surface 56.<br>
A roller weight 58 is disposed between the cam surface<br>
56 of the movable sheave half body 51b and the cam plate<br>
57.<br>
The secondary sheave 52 includes a fixed sheave half<br>
body 52a positioned inside in the vehicle width direction<br>
and a movable sheave half body 52b positioned outside<br>
in the vehicle width direction and facing the fixed sheave<br>
half body 52a. The movable sheave half body 52b is<br>
mounted on a right part of the secondary sheave shaft<br>
53. The movable sheave half body 52b rotates together<br>
with the secondary sheave shaft 53, and is slidable in<br>
18<br><br>
the axis direction of the secondary sheave shaft 53. A<br>
compression coil spring 59 is provided on the right side<br>
of the secondary sheave 52. The movable sheave half body<br>
52b receives a leftward pressure from the compression<br>
coil spring 59. An axis part of the fixed sheave half<br>
body 52a is a cylindrical slide collar, and is<br>
spline-fitted into the secondary sheave shaft 53. A<br>
V-shaped belt groove 52c is formed between the fixed<br>
sheave half body 52a and the movable sheave half body<br>
52b.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6, the V-belt 55 includes a<br>
plurality of resin blocks 55a formed into a shape such<br>
that a letter H is rotated by a right angle and a pair<br>
of coupling members 55b for coupling the plurality of<br>
the resin blocks 55a together. The coupling member 55b<br>
is fitted in a concaving part 55c formed from a side<br>
surface of the resin block 55a toward a center part, and<br>
extends in a direction that the resin blocks 55a are<br>
arrayed as shown in FIG. 6(b). As shown in FIG. 6(a),<br>
a cross section of the resin block 55a is formed into<br>
a shape such that a letter H is rotated by a right angle.<br>
The resin block 55a is also formed into a V-shape, and<br>
thereby it is formed to match the V-shapes of the belt<br>
groove 51c of the primary sheave 51 and the belt groove<br>
52c of the secondary sheave 52 (see FIG. 5).<br>
19<br><br>
As Shown in FIG. 5, a plurality of impellers 60 are<br>
formed at a right part of the fixed sheave half body 51a<br>
of the primary sheave 51. Also, as mentioned above, the<br>
intake duct 71 (see FIG. 1) is connected to the intake<br>
opening 78 formed on a top surface of the transmission<br>
casing 36. Further, the intake opening 78 is formed on<br>
the front half part (above the primary sheave 51) of the<br>
transmission casing 36. Therefore, the intake duct 71<br>
is connected to a part more forward than a rear end of<br>
the primary sheave 51.<br>
With such a construction, when the fixed sheave half<br>
body 51a rotates together with the primary sheave shaft<br>
23a, the impellers 60 induct air into the belt chamber<br>
38 through the intake opening 78, and also air inside<br>
the belt chamber 38 is discharged outside. In this<br>
embodiment, the impellers 60 are formed to helically<br>
extend outside in the diameter direction from a center<br>
part of the fixed sheave half body 51a. However, a shape<br>
of the impeller 60 is not limited to any specific shape,<br>
and a number of the impellers is not limited to a specific<br>
number either. In addition, impellers as a body<br>
separated from the fixed sheave half body 51a can be<br>
provided outside the fixed sheave half body 51a.<br>
FIG. 7 is a perspective view of the second case block<br>
20b and the inner case 36a. As shown in FIG. 7, a front<br>
20<br><br>
half part 66 of the inner case 36a is formed into a bowl<br>
shape swelling out leftward. A rear half part of the<br>
inner case 36a is formed into a bowl shape swelling out<br>
rightward. A hole 68 for inserting the primary sheave<br>
shaft 23a (see FIG. 5) of the CVT 17 is formed on the<br>
front half part 66. A hole 69 for inserting the secondary<br>
sheave shaft 53 (see FIG. 5) of the CVT 17 is formed on<br>
the rear half part 66. In FIG. 7, the clutch cover 37<br>
(see FIG. 5) interposed between the inner case 36a and<br>
the second case block 20b is not shown.<br>
Ventilation ports 72 are provided on the inner case<br>
36a. In this embodiment, the ventilation port is formed<br>
into a circular shape. Three ventilation ports are<br>
formed in positions upper than a vertical center of the<br>
inner case 36a. However, a shape of the ventilation port<br>
is not limited at all. A position of the ventilation port<br>
is not necessarily limited to an upper part of the inner<br>
case 36a. In this embodiment, the ventilation port 72<br>
is provided on each of the front half part 66 and the<br>
rear half part 67 of the inner case 36a. However, the<br>
ventilation port 72 can be formed on only either one of<br>
the front half part 66 and the rear half part 67 . A number<br>
of the ventilation port 72 is not specifically limited<br>
either.<br>
A plurality of ventilation ports 73 are formed at<br>
21<br><br>
a lower right part of the second case block 20b.<br>
Specifically, the second case block 20b includes a<br>
periphery part 74 installed upright rightward. This<br>
periphery part 74 has a shape corresponding to an outline<br>
shape of the transmission casing 36. Further, a lower<br>
part of the periphery part 74 has a notched part, in which<br>
the notches are formed as slits. Namely, it is formed<br>
into a so-called comb shape. Therefore, a space 75<br>
divided demarcated by the second case block 20b and the<br>
inner case 36a is communicatively connected to an outside<br>
of the engine unit 15 (see FIG. 5) through the ventilation<br>
ports 75. In addition, because a right part of the rear<br>
half part of the second case block 20b is covered by the<br>
clutch cover 37, the space 75 is formed between the clutch<br>
cover 37 and the inner case 36a in the rear half part<br>
of the second case block 20b (see FIG. 5).<br>
Reinforcement ribs 76 are provided on the<br>
comb-shaped part of the periphery part 74. An oil pan<br>
77 is provided below the ventilation ports 73.<br>
With the above construction, air in the belt chamber<br>
38 is introduced into the space 75 through the ventilation<br>
ports 72 of the inner case 36a, and further discharged<br>
toward the oil pan 77 through the ventilation ports 73<br>
of the second case block 20b. As a result, the air is<br>
discharged outside the engine unit 15.<br>
22<br><br>
As foregoing, in this embodiment, a lower part of<br>
the periphery part 74 of the second case block 20b is<br>
formed into a comb shape. This comb-shaped part forms<br>
a plurality of slit-like ventilation ports 73. However,<br>
a shape of the ventilation port 73 is not limited to a<br>
slit, but of course can be an opening shaped differently,<br>
such as a circular shape. A shape, a size, or a number<br>
of the ventilation port 73 of the second case block 20b<br>
is not specifically limited.<br>
FIG. 8 is an enlarged drawing for showing a part<br>
of FIG. 5. As shown in FIG. 8, a sealing recess 61 is<br>
formed on the left side of the periphery part of the inner<br>
case 36a. A right periphery part of the second case block<br>
20b is fitted in the sealing recess 61. An O-ring 62 is<br>
inserted in a space between the inner case 36a and the<br>
second case clock 20b in the sealing recess 61. A sealing<br>
recess 63 is formed on the right side of the periphery<br>
part of the inner case 36a. The periphery part of the<br>
outer case 36b is fitted in the sealing recess 63. An<br>
O-ring 64 is inserted in a space between the inner case<br>
36a and the outer case 36b in the sealing recess 63. The<br>
outer case 36b and the second case block 20b are fastened<br>
together by a bolt 65 with the inner case 36a interposed<br>
between them.<br>
The centrifugal clutch 18 is mounted on the left<br>
23<br><br>
side of the secondary sheave shaft 53. The centrifugal<br>
clutch 18 is a wet type multiple disc type clutch, and<br>
includes a generally cylindrical clutch housing 81 and<br>
a clutch boss 82. The clutch housing 81 is spline-fitted<br>
in the secondary sheave shaft 53, and rotates integrally<br>
with the secondary sheave shaft 53. A plurality of<br>
ring-shaped clutch plates 83 is mounted in the clutch<br>
housing 81. Those clutch plates 83 are arranged in the<br>
axial direction of the secondary sheave shaft 53 at<br>
intervals.<br>
A cylindrical gear 85 is rotatably fitted around<br>
a left part of the secondary sheave shaft 53 via a bearing<br>
84. The clutch boss 82 is disposed inside in the redial<br>
direction of the clutch plate 83 and outside in the redial<br>
direction of the gear 85, and engages with the gear 85.<br>
Therefore, the gear 85 rotates together with the clutch<br>
boss 82. A plurality of ring-shaped friction plates 86<br>
is mounted outside in the redial direction of the clutch<br>
boss 82. Those friction plates 86 are arranged in the<br>
axial direction of the secondary sheave shaft 53 at<br>
intervals. Each of the friction plates 86 is disposed<br>
between the neighboring clutch plates 83, 83.<br>
A plurality of cam surfaces 87 is formed on the left<br>
side of the clutch housing 81. A roller weight 88 is<br>
disposed between the cam surfaces 87 and the rightmost<br>
24<br><br>
clutch plate 83 facing the cam surfaces 87.<br>
In the centrifugal clutch 18, a state of the clutch<br>
is automatically switched between a clutch-in state (an<br>
engaging) and a clutch-off state (a disengaging)<br>
corresponding to the amount of centrifugal force acting<br>
on the roller weight 88.<br>
That is, as a rotational speed of the clutch housing<br>
81 becomes a prescribed speed or more, the roller weight<br>
88 receives a centrifugal force and moves outside in the<br>
radial direction. The roller weight 88 pushes the clutch<br>
plates 83 leftward. As a result, the clutch plates 83<br>
is compressedly contacted with the friction plates 86.<br>
A driving force of the secondary sheave shaft 53 is<br>
transmitted through the centrifugal clutch 18 to an<br>
output shaft (not shown). It is a clutch-in state.<br>
Meanwhile, as a rotational speed of the clutch<br>
housing 81 becomes less than a prescribed speed, a<br>
centrifugal force acting on the roller weight 88 becomes<br>
small, and the roller weight 88 moves inside in the radial<br>
direction. As a result, the clutch plates 83 and the<br>
friction plates 86 are released from the compressed<br>
contact. Now, a driving force of the secondary sheave<br>
shaft 53 is not transmitted to the output shaft. It is<br>
a clutch-off state. In addition, the side lower than the<br>
secondary sheave shaft 53 shows a clutch-in state, and<br>
25<br><br>
the upper side shows a clutch-out state in FIG. 8.<br>
The speed reduction mechanism 19 is interposed<br>
between the centrifugal clutch 18 and the output shaft<br>
(not shown). The speed reduction mechanism 19 has a<br>
speed changing shaft 89 disposed parallel to the<br>
secondary sheave shaft 53. The speed changing shaft 89<br>
is rotatably supported by the first case block 20a via<br>
a bearing 90. Also, the speed changing shaft 89 is<br>
rotatably supported by the second case block 20b via a<br>
bearing 91. A first speed changing gear 92 for engaging<br>
with the gear 85 is provided at a right end of the speed<br>
changing gear 89.<br>
A second speed changing gear 93 with a diameter<br>
smaller than the first speed changing gear 92 is provided<br>
at a center part of the speed changing shaft 89. The<br>
second speed changing gear 93 is disposed to engage with<br>
an output shaft not shown or a gear provided on the output<br>
shaft, which is not shown.<br>
With such a construction, the clutch boss 82 and<br>
the output shaft are coupled via the gear 85, the first<br>
speed changing gear 92, the speed changing shaft 89, the<br>
second speed changing gear 93, and so forth. Therefore,<br>
the output shaft rotates following a rotation of the<br>
clutch boss 82. In addition, although not shown, a drive<br>
transmission mechanism such as a chain for transmitting<br>
26<br><br>
a drive of the output shaft to the rear wheel 13 (see<br>
FIG. 1) is wound around the output shaft. A drive<br>
conversion mechanism can be a member other than a chain,<br>
such as a transmission belt, a gear mechanism combining<br>
a plurality of gears, and a drive shaft.<br>
The foregoing is the construction of the engine unit<br>
15. Next, a cooling operation of the CVT will be<br>
described.<br>
-Cooling operation of CVT 17—<br>
When the engine unit 15 operates, the primary sheave<br>
shaft 23a of the CVT 17 rotates, and the impellers 60<br>
of the fixed sheave half body 51a of the primary sheave<br>
51 rotate together with it. As a result, a suction force<br>
inducting air from the intake duct 71 into the belt<br>
chamber 38 is generated.<br>
Accordingly, air is inducted into the air chamber<br>
94 through the intake opening 94a (see FIG. 4) . The air<br>
passes through the filter (not shown) and is cleaned up,<br>
and then the air is inducted into the belt chamber 38<br>
through the intake duct 71. The air inducted into the<br>
belt chamber 38 flows through spaces around the primary<br>
sheave 51, the secondary sheave 52, and the V-belt 55,<br>
and cools down the primary sheave 51, the secondary sheave<br>
52, and the V-belt 55.<br>
The air cooled down the primary sheave 51, the<br>
27<br><br>
secondary sheave 52, and the V-belt is discharged from<br>
the belt chamber 38 through ventilation ports 72 of the<br>
inner case 36a. The air flows into the space 75 between<br>
the inner case 36a and the second case block 20b (see<br>
FIG. 7) . The air in the space 75 is discharged outside<br>
through the ventilation ports 73 formed at the lower part<br>
of the second case block 20b. With the above air flow,<br>
the CVT 17 is continuously and regularly cooled down.<br>
As foregoing, in the motorcycle 1 in this embodiment,<br>
the intake duct 71 forming a part of the intake passage<br>
(air passage) extends rearward from the transmission<br>
casing 36 passing over the seat pillar 6R in a side view.<br>
Therefore, the intake passage is elongated in the<br>
motorcycle 1. Meanwhile, the elongated intake passage<br>
may interrupt with the vehicle body frame 2. However,<br>
in this embodiment, the intake duct 71 has the curving<br>
part 71a curving at a part around the seat pillar 6R.<br>
The intake duct 71 curves keeping clear of the seat pillar<br>
6R. Therefore, an interruption between the intake duct<br>
71 and the seat pillar 6R is prevented.<br>
With this embodiment, noise of the CVT 17, which<br>
occurs inside the belt chamber 38 , is damped largely while<br>
passing through the intake duct 71 because the intake<br>
duct 71 is long. Also, as mentioned above, a major factor<br>
of noise occurring in the CVT 17 is pitch noise due to<br>
28<br><br>
a large number of the resin blocks 55a included in the<br>
V-belt 55. Pitch noise is a high frequency sound, and<br>
highly tends to travel linearly. Therefore, pitch noise<br>
is largely attenuated at the curving part 71a of the<br>
intake duct 71 when the pitch noise passes through the<br>
intake duct 71. Accordingly, noise of the CVT 17<br>
released outside is sufficiently prevented because of<br>
a synergetic effect between a large length of the intake<br>
duct 71 and inclusion of the curving part 71a.<br>
Generally, it is preferable that an air passage<br>
should not have a curving part in the view of ventilation<br>
such as smooth introduction or discharge of air. However,<br>
in this embodiment, the curving part 71a is provided in<br>
the intake duct 71 on purpose, and thereby it prevents<br>
high frequency sounds, which have a high tendency to<br>
travel straight, from leaking outside.-<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, in this embodiment, the intake<br>
opening 78 to which the intake duct 71 is connected is<br>
formed at the front half part of the transmission casing<br>
36 (above the primary sheave 51) . Therefore, the intake<br>
duct 71 is connected to a part more forward than the rear<br>
end of the primary sheave 51. Thereby, a length of the<br>
intake duct 71 extending rearward can be larger.<br>
Therefore, noise of the CVT 17 can be more effectively<br>
prevented with the motorcycle 1.<br>
29<br><br>
A pair of the right and left seat pillars 6R and<br>
6L are provided in the motorcycle 1. A part of the engine<br>
unit 15 is supported by both the seat pillars 6R and 6L.<br>
Therefore, a rigidity of the vehicle body frame 2 can<br>
be enhanced. On the other hand, because the seat pillars<br>
6L and 6R are provided on the right and on the left as<br>
a pair, the seat pillars 6L and 6R protrude in the vehicle<br>
width direction. However, with this embodiment, the<br>
intake duct 71 passes through a space between the left<br>
seat pillar 6L and the right seat pillar 6R. Thereby,<br>
noise of the CVT 17 can be prevented, and also the<br>
motorcycle 1 can be intended to be slimly formed.<br>
In the motorcycle 1, the right and left foot rests<br>
80 are disposed outside of the respective seat pillars<br>
6L and 6R in the vehicle width direction. However, the<br>
intake duct 71 passes through a space between the seat<br>
pillars 6L and 6R. Therefore, although the intake duct<br>
71 extends rearward passing over the seat pillar 6R, the<br>
intake duct 71 does not disturb the feet of a driver on<br>
the foot rests 80.<br>
Also, in this embodiment, the intake duct 71 extends<br>
more rearward than the seat pillar 6R, and thus it<br>
facilitates a prevention of intrusion of muddy water and<br>
the like splashed up by the front wheel 12 into the intake<br>
duct 71.<br>
30<br><br>
The intake opening 94a of the air chamber 94 of the<br>
motorcycle 1 is positioned upper than the pivot shaft<br>
10. Therefore, the intake opening 94a is positioned<br>
relatively away from the ground, and disposed in a<br>
position such that the intake opening 94a is not apt to<br>
induct water and dust. The intake opening 94a is<br>
positioned below the seat 3. A part above the intake<br>
opening 94a is covered by the seat 3 because of such a<br>
disposition. Thus, intrusion of water, dust and so forth<br>
into the air chamber 94 can be prevented. Therefore, the<br>
motorcycle 1 facilitates supply of fresh air into the<br>
belt chamber 38.<br>
The intake duct 71 of the motorcycle 1 passes<br>
through a space between the cylinder 21 of the engine<br>
16 and the seat pillar 6R. Also, the intake duct 71 passes<br>
through a space between the left seat pillar 6L and the<br>
right seat pillar 6R. Further, the intake duct 71 passes<br>
through a space between the rear cushion unit 30 and the<br>
seat pillar 6R. Therefore, a space between the seat<br>
pillar 6L and the seat pillar 6R, a space between the<br>
cylinder 21 and the seat pillar 6R, and a space between<br>
the rear cushion unit 30 and the seat pillar 6R can be<br>
effectively used as spaces for providing the air passage.<br>
Accordingly, the motorcycle 1 can certainly provide a<br>
sufficient space for disposing the air passage without<br>
31<br><br>
making the vehicle larger. As a result, it can realize<br>
an air passage having a sufficient cross sectional area<br>
of a flow passage.<br>
As mentioned above, the curving part 71a of the<br>
intake duct 71 is positioned inside the inner end of the<br>
seat pillar 6R in the vehicle width direction, that is,<br>
positioned left of the sear pillar 6R. Meanwhile, a part<br>
of the intake duct 71 (a part in a vicinity of the<br>
connection part where the intake duct 71 connects to the<br>
transmission casing 36) is positioned outside the seat<br>
pillar 6R in the vehicle width direction, that is,<br>
positioned right of the seat pillar 6R. In other words,<br>
the intake duct 71 reaches a part inside the seat pillar<br>
6R from the part outside the seat pillar 6R in the vehicle<br>
width direction. The intake duct 71 largely curves.<br>
Therefore, a high frequency sound occurring in the CVT<br>
17 can be more effectively prevented with the motorcycle<br>
1 of this embodiment.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, in this embodiment, an end (a<br>
right end) of the primary sheave shaft 23a is positioned<br>
inside an end (a right end) of the secondary sheave shaft<br>
53 in the vehicle width direction. Thus, the primary<br>
sheave 51 has a more space on a lateral side of its sheave<br>
shaft comparing with a space that the secondary sheave<br>
52 has. The intake duct 71 is connected to a part of the<br>
32<br><br>
transmission casing 36 closer to the primary sheave 51.<br>
That is, the intake duct 71 is connected to the part that<br>
has more space on its lateral side. Therefore, as shown<br>
in FIG. 4, such a connection can prevent a projection<br>
of the connection part between the intake duct 71 and<br>
the transmission casing 36 in a transverse direction,<br>
and thereby the motorcycle 1 can be facilitated to be<br>
slimmed down.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, in this embodiment, the exhaust<br>
pipe 41 of the engine 16 extends rearward passing through<br>
a space below the intake duct 71 and the transmission<br>
casing 36 of the CVT 17. Thus, an interruption between<br>
the exhaust pipe 41 and the intake duct 71 can be facilely<br>
prevented. Therefore, the intake duct 71 can curve<br>
without being interrupted by the exhaust pipe 41, and<br>
a sufficient length of the intake duct 71 can be assured.<br><second embodiment><br>
As shown in FIG. 3, in the first embodiment, the<br>
exhaust pipe 41 of the engine 16 extends forward and<br>
obliquely rightward downward, then curves rearward,<br>
passes through a space below the transmission casing 36<br>
of the engine unit 15, and further extends rearward.<br>
However, as shown in FIGs. 9(a) and (b), in a second<br>
embodiment, a length of the air chamber 94 in the vertical<br>
direction is shortened to secure a space above the intake<br>
33<br><br>
duct 71 and the air chamber 94, and thereby the exhaust<br>
pipe 41 passes through the space.<br>
Specifically, the exhaust pipe 41 extends forward<br>
and obliquely rightward downward from the cylinder head<br>
22, then curves rearward upward, passes through the space<br>
above the intake duct 71 and the air chamber 94, and<br>
further extends rearward. The muffler 42 is connected<br>
to a rear end of the exhaust pipe 41 similarly to the<br>
first embodiment. The muffler 42 is disposed on the<br>
right side above the rear wheel 13. Other parts of<br>
construction are almost the same as the first embodiment.<br>
As foregoing, with this embodiment, the exhaust<br>
pipe 41 can be disposed above the intake duct 71 and the<br>
air chamber 94. Thereby, a sufficiently large space can<br>
be obtained below the frame 2.<br><third embodiment><br>
As shown in FIG. 4, in the first embodiment, the<br>
transmission casing 36 to which the front part of the<br>
intake duct 71 is connected, and the air chamber 94<br>
forming the rear part of the air passage are disposed<br>
on the same side (the right side) in the vehicle width<br>
direction. However, as shown in FIGs. 10(a) and (b), in<br>
the third embodiment, the transmission casing 36 is<br>
disposed on the right side in the vehicle width direction,<br>
and the air chamber 94 is disposed on the opposite side,<br>
34<br><br>
which is the left side, in the vehicle width direction.<br>
With such dispositions of the air chamber 94 and<br>
the intake duct 71, in this embodiment, the air chamber<br>
94 and the air chamber 43 are disposed on the same side<br>
(the left side) in the vehicle width direction. In this<br>
embodiment, the air chamber 94 and the air chamber 43<br>
are formed into a united case body. Specifically, two<br>
spaces are formed inside a case body. That is, a case<br>
body is demarcated into a space for the air chamber 94<br>
and a space for the air chamber 43. Also, in this<br>
embodiment, the rear end of the intake duct 71 is disposed<br>
on the left side in the vehicle width direction. Thereby,<br>
it makes a space on the opposite side, which is the right<br>
side. To effectively use this space, the battery 50 is<br>
disposed on the right side. Further, the exhaust pipe<br>
41 of the engine 16 is disposed on the right side in the<br>
vehicle width direction and above the transmission casing<br>
36 similarly to the second embodiment. Other parts of<br>
construction are almost the same as the first embodiment.<br>
As foregoing, with this embodiment, the intake duct<br>
71 extends from the right side to the left side in the<br>
vehicle width direction, and thereby the intake duct 71<br>
can be made longer. The air chamber 94 and the air chamber<br>
43 are formed into a united case body and are made more<br>
compact. This assures an obtainment of a large space<br>
35<br><br>
above the transmission casing 36. Thereby, with this<br>
embodiment, the intake duct 71 can be largely curved.<br>
Therefore, with this embodiment, noise of the CVT 17 can<br>
be more effectively prevented.<br>
Similarly to the second embodiment, the exhaust<br>
pipe 41 can be disposed in a space above the transmission<br>
casing 36, and thereby a sufficiently large space can<br>
be provided below the frame 2.<br><forth embodiment><br>
As shown in FIGs . 11 (a) and (b) , in this embodiment,<br>
the exhaust pipe 41 and the muffler 42 disposed above<br>
the transmission casing 36 in the third embodiment are<br>
disposed below the transmission casing 36, similarly to<br>
the first embodiment. With such a mode, the air passage<br>
for inducting air into the belt chamber 38 can be formed<br>
long, and noise can be prevented, similarly to all the<br>
embodiments described above . Also, with this embodiment,<br>
an interruption between the intake duct 71 and the exhaust<br>
pipe 41 and an interruption between the intake pipe 40<br>
and the exhaust pipe 41 can be facilely prevented.<br><fifth embodiment><br>
As shown in FIGs. 12(a) and (b) , in the fifth<br>
embodiment, similarly to the third embodiment, the air<br>
chamber 94 to which the rear end of the intake duct 71<br>
is connected is disposed on the left side in the vehicle<br>
36<br><br>
width direction, which is the side opposite to the<br>
transmission casing 36. Corresponding to this<br>
disposition, the air chamber 43 of the engine 16 is<br>
disposed on the right side in the vehicle width direction,<br>
which is the side opposite to the air chamber 94. Other<br>
parts of construction are the same as the first<br>
embodiment.<br>
With this embodiment, similarly to the third<br>
embodiment, the intake duct 71 extends from the right<br>
side to the left side in the vehicle width direction,<br>
and thus the intake duct 71 can be made long. Also, the<br>
intake duct 71 can be largely curved. Therefore, with<br>
this embodiment, noise of the CVT 17 can be effectively<br>
prevented also. The air chamber 43 is disposed on the<br>
side opposite to the air chamber 94 in the vehicle width<br>
direction, and thereby those parts can be laid out in<br>
a good balance. Therefore, with this embodiment, the air<br>
passage can be formed long without increasing a width<br>
of the vehicle. An interruption between the intake duct<br>
71, the intake pipe 40 and the exhaust pipe 41 can be<br>
facilely prevented with this embodiment also.<br><sixth embodiment><br>
As shown in FIG. 12(b), in the fifth embodiment,<br>
the exhaust pipe 41 of the engine 16 extends forward and<br>
obliquely rightward downward from the cylinder head 22,<br>
37<br><br>
then curves rearward, passes through a space below the<br>
transmission casing 36 of the engine unit 15, and further<br>
extends rearward. However, as shown in FIGs. 13(a) and<br>
(b), in the sixth embodiment, a vertical length of the<br>
air chamber 94 is shortened to assure a space above the<br>
air chamber 94. Thereby, the exhaust duct 41 passes<br>
through the space.<br>
Specifically, the exhaust pipe 41 extends forward<br>
and obliquely leftward downward from the cylinder head<br>
22, then curves rearward, passes through a space inside<br>
the seat pillar 6L and a space above the air chamber 94,<br>
and further extends rearward. The muffler 42 is<br>
connected to the rear end of the exhaust pipe 41. The<br>
muffler 42 is disposed on the left side above the rear<br>
wheel 13. Other parts of construction are almost the<br>
same as the fifth embodiment.<br>
As foregoing, noise of the CVT 17 can be effectively<br>
prevented with this embodiment also. The exhaust pipe<br>
41 is disposed above the air chamber 94, and thereby a<br>
sufficiently large space can be obtained below the frame<br>
2.<br>
Oeventh Embodiment&gt;<br>
As shown in FIGs. 14(a) and (b), in the seventh<br>
embodiment, the air chamber 43 is disposed on the same<br>
side as the air chamber 94 (the right side) in the vehicle<br>
38<br><br>
width direction, and the air chamber 43 and the air<br>
chamber 94 are formed into a united case body. Also, in<br>
this embodiment, the air chamber 43 is disposed on the<br>
right side in the vehicle width direction, and thereby<br>
a space is obtained on the left side. The battery 50 is<br>
disposed in this obtained space on the left side. Other<br>
parts of construction are almost the same as the first<br>
embodiment.<br>
Noise of the CVT 17 can be effectively prevented<br>
with this embodiment also.<br><eighth embodiment><br>
As shown in FIGs. 15(a) and (b), in this embodiment,<br>
the exhaust pipe 41 and the muffler 42 disposed below<br>
the transmission casing 36 in the seventh embodiment are<br>
disposed above the battery 50. With such a mode,<br>
similarly to each of the above embodiments, the air<br>
passage for inducting air into the belt chamber 38 can<br>
be formed long. Noise of the CVT 17 can be effectively<br>
prevented with this embodiment also.<br>
In each of the above embodiments, the air passage<br>
according to the present invention is the intake passage<br>
for inducting air into the belt chamber 38, and this<br>
intake passage is constructed with the intake duct 71<br>
and the air chamber 94. However, the air passage<br>
according to the present invention is not limited to the<br>
39<br><br>
above intake passage. The air passage according to the<br>
present invention can be also an exhaust passage for<br>
discharging air from the belt chamber 38. The air<br>
passage according to the present invention can be, for<br>
example, an exhaust passage including a duct 71 used as<br>
an exhaust duct, in which the duct 71 used as an intake<br>
duct in the above embodiments is used as the exhaust duct<br>
for discharging a cooling air inducted into the belt<br>
chamber 38. In such a case, a duct for an intake purpose<br>
or an intake opening can be separately provided for the<br>
transmission casing 36, for example.<br>
In each of the above embodiments, descriptions are<br>
made for the cases that a sound absorption material is<br>
not disposed inside the transmission casing 36. However,<br>
it does not mean that the present invention excludes the<br>
cases that a sound absorption material is disposed inside<br>
the transmission casing 36. Therefore, it is a matter<br>
of course that a sound absorption material can be disposed<br>
inside the transmission casing 36 in each of the above<br>
embodiments for a further reduction of noise, for<br>
example.<br>
