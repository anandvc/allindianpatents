				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING ISOCYANATES AND AROMATIC HYDROXY<br>
COMPOUNDS<br>
[0001]<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing isocyanate compounds<br>
and aromatic hydroxy compounds, which are useful for raw materials for aromatic<br>
polycarbonate.<br>
[0002]<br>
Background Art<br>
Plastics are used as product materials in all fields of daily life, and the amount<br>
of plastics used is increasing each year. Accompanying this increase, the amount of<br>
discarded plastics is also extremely large, thus resulting in the treatment of plastics<br>
becoming a significant social issue.<br>
[0003]<br>
At present, the majority of plastic products are simply disposed of by being<br>
incinerated or buried following completion of their use. However, when waste plastic<br>
having high heat of combustion in terms of calories is disposed of by incinerating in<br>
an ordinary refuse incinerator, abnormal combustion occurs resulting in the problem<br>
of damage to the incinerator furnace. In addition, not only does this manner of<br>
disposal result in wasted resources, but it also causes environmental problems in<br>
terms of environmental contamination and discharge of carbon dioxide gas. Thus, it<br>
is extremely important to recycle waste plastics from the viewpoint of the formation of<br>
a recycling society as well.<br>
[0004]<br>
Methods used to recycle waste plastics include material recycling, in which<br>
waste plastics are reused as is, chemical recycling, in which waste plastics are<br>
chemically degraded followed by recovery of monomers and other useful chemical<br>
raw materials, and thermal recycling, in which thermal energy is recovered from<br>
waste plastics. Among these, since material recycling is accompanied by heat<br>
treatment of the waste plastics, the heat treatment has a considerable effect on both<br>
the chemical properties and physical properties of the waste plastics, and frequently<br>
results in problems such as deterioration of impact resistance, deformation under a<br>
load or high temperatures, tensile strength, bending strength, fluidity and other<br>
properties. In addition, although thermal recycling offers the advantage of being<br>
able to inhibit the amount of fossil fuels used as a result of effectively utilizing thermal<br>
energy, there are also numerous problems such as damage to the incinerator furnace,<br>
discharge of carbon dioxide gas and the need to implement measures against<br>
dioxins as described above.<br>
[0005]<br>
Aromatic polycarbonate resins constitute a typical engineering plastic having<br>
superior transparency, optical properties and mechanical properties, and are<br>
extremely high added value materials used in a wide range of applications such as<br>
CDs, DVDs and other optical fields, various home appliances, cameras, cell phones,<br>
OA equipment, medical equipment, automobiles and other industrial fields, sports<br>
and other recreational fields, and roofing materials, alternative glass materials and<br>
other construction fields.<br>
[0006]<br>
Various methods have been proposed thus far for chemically recycling aromatic<br>
polycarbonates.<br>
[0007]<br>
According to Non-patent document 1, although a process is described for<br>
obtaining bisphenol A by chemically decomposing polycarbonate resin with ammonia<br>
water, decomposition of the polycarbonate resin requires a long period of time,<br>
thereby resulting in the problem of being unsuitable for large-volume processing of<br>
waste plastics.<br>
[0008]<br>
In addition, Patent document 1 discloses a process for recovering bisphenol A<br>
by decomposing polycarbonate resin by adding ammonia water and an organic<br>
solvent in the form of aluminum chloride to a polycarbonate resin. However, there<br>
are many cases in which chemical decomposition of the polycarbonate requires a<br>
long period of time with this process as well.<br>
[0009]<br>
Examples of processes for shortening the time required to decompose<br>
polycarbonate resins in this manner may include a process for recovering useful<br>
materials from waste plastics having polycarbonate resin for the main component<br>
thereof disclosed in Patent document 2 which comprises a step of chemically<br>
decomposing a polycarbonate resin in a solution containing waste plastic and a<br>
decomposition agent in the form of a primary amine, and a step of recovering the<br>
decomposition product in the form of a useful material. In this process, the<br>
polycarbonate resin is reacted with an excess of primary amine equivalent to six or<br>
more times the number of moles of carbonic acid ester groups as calculated from the<br>
molecular weight of the repetitive units of the polycarbonate resin, followed by<br>
recovery of useful materials such as the degradation product in the form of bisphenol<br>
A and urea derivatives. In addition, according to Non-patent document 2, it is<br>
described that bisphenol A and 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone (DMI) are obtained by<br>
decomposing polycarbonate with N,N'-dimethyl-1,2-diaminoethane. Among these<br>
recovery products, although bisphenol A can be easily imagined to be used as a raw<br>
material for the production of polycarbonate resin, there are no descriptions<br>
regarding the use of urea derivatives or DMI, and the usefulness thereof is unclear.<br>
[0010]<br>
In addition, according to Patent document 3, for example, a process is<br>
disclosed for obtaining bisphenols and diaryl carbonate by cleaving polycarbonate<br>
resin by carrying out a transesterification reaction between polycarbonate resin and<br>
phenol in the presence of a catalyst. It is described to the effect that monomers<br>
obtained by this process can be recondensed to produce polymer plastics. In<br>
addition, in Patent dpcument 4, for example, a process for recovering useful<br>
materials from waste plastics mainly composed of polycarbonate is disclosed<br>
whereby decomposition products are recovered in the form of useful materials by<br>
chemically decomposing polycarbonate resin in a solution containing an organic<br>
solvent that causes polycarbonate resin to dissolve or swell, a tertiary amine and a<br>
lower alcohol. In this process, examples of recovered useful materials are listed as<br>
being bisphenol A and carbonic acid ester. Since each of these processes requires<br>
an alkaline catalyst to decompose the polycarbonate by a transesterification reaction,<br>
there are many cases in which the procedure becomes complex, such as requiring<br>
deactivation of the alkaline catalyst during separation and purification of the<br>
decomposition products.<br>
[0011]<br>
As an example of a process not requiring a catalyst, Non-patent document 3<br>
discloses a process for producing bisphenol A by hydrolyzing polycarbonate under<br>
supercritical conditions (supercritical aqueous or subcritical aqueous conditions).<br>
Although there is no description regarding yield and the reaction efficiency is not<br>
clearly stated in this document, since the reaction is carried out under high<br>
temperature and high pressure conditions, not only is there the possibility of the<br>
concurrent occurrence of thermal decomposition of the bisphenol A under such<br>
conditions, but also due to the extremely strong acidity of the water itself under<br>
supercritical aqueous conditions along with the high temperature in excess of 300°C<br>
and high pressure in excess of 200 atm, the apparatus and equipment become<br>
excessively complex, thereby making it difficult to carry out the process economically.<br>
[0012]<br>
Patent document 5 discloses a process for recovering aromatic bisphenol and<br>
carbonic acid ester formed by reacting polycarbonate obtained by melting and<br>
filtration from disk-shaped optical recording media with an aliphatic alcohol having 1<br>
to 6 carbon atoms in a subcritical or supercritical state. In this process, in addition to<br>
the reaction vessel being large since an excess of aliphatic alcohol is used based on<br>
the polycarbonate, similar to the case of the process described in Non-patent<br>
document 3, since the reaction vessel is required to be of a design capable of<br>
withstanding a high temperature and high pressure state, the large reactors used in<br>
typical commercial plants encounter difficulties both in terms of design and economy.<br>
[0013]<br>
Although polycarbonates have a typical structure in which, for example, a<br>
bisphenol A unit and a carbonyl unit are alternately arranged in a polymer chain, the<br>
chemical recycling processes disclosed thus far disclose technologies that only<br>
attempt to effectively recycle one of these units or technologies that only attempt to<br>
recover the bisphenol A. However, there have been no successful examples of<br>
chemically recycling both units in the form of effective compounds at a high recovery<br>
yield.<br>
Thus, although there has been a strong desire for the development of a<br>
process for chemically recycling waste aromatic polycarbonate resins, an effective<br>
process has yet to be found.<br>
[0014]<br>
As previously described, polycarbonate resins are formed from, for example,<br>
bisphenol A and carbonyl units. The recovery of this carbonyl unit in the form of an<br>
industrially effective compound is an important issue for chemical recycling of<br>
polycarbonate resins. Examples of industrially effective compounds having a<br>
carbonyl group may include carbonic acid esters and isocyanates. Isocyanates are<br>
widely used as production raw materials of polyurethane foam, paints and adhesives.<br>
The most commonly used process for industrial production of isocyanates consists of<br>
reacting an amine compound with phosgene (phosgene method), and nearly the<br>
entire amount of isocyanates produced throughout the world are produced according<br>
to the phosgene method. However, the phosgene method has numerous problems.<br>
[0015]<br>
Firstly, this method requires the use of a large amount of phosgene as raw<br>
material. Phosgene is extremely toxic and requires special handling precautions to<br>
prevent exposure of handlers thereof, and also requires special apparatuses to<br>
detoxify waste.<br>
[0016]<br>
Secondly, since highly corrosive hydrogen chloride is produced in large<br>
amounts as a by-product of the phosgene method, in addition to requiring a process<br>
for detoxifying the hydrogen chloride, in many cases hydrolytic chlorine is contained<br>
in the isocyanates produced, which may have a detrimental effect on the weather<br>
resistance and heat resistance of polyurethane products in the case of using<br>
isocyanates produced using the phosgene method.<br>
[0017]<br>
On the basis of this background, a process for producing isocyanates has been<br>
sought that does not use phosgene. One example of a method for producing<br>
isocyanate compounds without using phosgene that has been proposed involves<br>
thermal decomposition of carbamic acid esters. Isocyanates and hydroxy<br>
compounds have long been known to be obtained by thermal decomposition of<br>
carbamic acid esters (see, for example, Non-patent document 4). The basic<br>
reaction is illustrated by the following formula:<br>
[0018]<br>
R(NHCOOR')a -------? R(NCO)a + a R*OH a a a a a (1)<br>
[0019]<br>
(wherein R represents an organic residue having a valence of a, R1 represents a<br>
monovalent organic residue, and a represents an integer of 1 or more).<br>
[0020]<br>
Among carbamic acid esters, aryl carbamates, in which the ester group is an<br>
aromatic group, offer the advantage of allowing the setting of a lower temperature for<br>
the thermal decomposition reaction as compared with alkyl carbamates in which the<br>
ester group is an alkyl group (see, for example, Patent document 6).<br>
[0021]<br>
Various processes have been disclosed thus far as processes for producing<br>
aryl carbamates. Patent document 7 describes the obtaining of a corresponding<br>
alkyl aryl monocarbamate at a yield of 90 to 95% by reacting an alkyl monoamine<br>
and a diaryl carbonate in the presence of a solvent such as benzene, dioxane or<br>
carbon tetrachloride. In addition, Patent document 8 proposes a process for<br>
continuously producing methyl carbamic acid phenyl ester from methylamine and<br>
diphenyl carbonate.<br>
[0022]<br>
However, each of these processes produces alkyl aryl carbamate using a lower<br>
alkyl monoamine for the amine, and do not constitute a process for producing an<br>
alkyl aryl polycarbamate. In the case of producing a corresponding alkyl<br>
polycarbamic acid aryl ester from an alkyl polyamine such as alkyl diamine or alkyl<br>
triamine, there are difficult problems that are completely different from those in the<br>
case of using an alkyl monoamine. This is because, although only urea compounds<br>
are produced as by-products due to side reactions represented by formula (3) and/or<br>
formula (4) in addition to the reaction represented by formula (2) in the case of an<br>
alkyl monoamine, in the case of an alkyl polyamine such as alkyl diamine or alkyl<br>
triamine, an extremely large number of types of urea compounds are produced as<br>
by-products, such as the compounds represented by formula (5) and/or formula (6)<br>
and/or formula (7).<br>
[0023]<br>
[0024]<br>
(wherein R' represents a monovalent alkyl group or aromatic group, Ar represents a<br>
monovalent aromatic group, and p, q and r respectively represent an integer of 1 or<br>
more.)<br>
[0025]<br>
Namely, there are the problems of these various urea compound side reactions<br>
causing a decrease in the yield of the target compound in the form of the alkyl aryl<br>
polycarbamate, as well as the extreme difficulty in separating and purifying the target<br>
product from a mixture of these urea compounds and polyurea compounds.<br>
[0026]<br>
Although Patent document 9 describes a process for synthesizing an aromatic<br>
urethane by reacting an aromatic amine and a diaryl carbonate in the presence of a<br>
Lewis acid catalyst at a temperature of 140 to 230°C, in this process as well, the use<br>
of a Lewis acid results in the problem of corrosion of the apparatus as well as<br>
difficulty in separating and recovering the product.<br>
[0027]<br>
Patent document 10 discloses a process for producing alkyl aryl polycarbamate<br>
comprising the use of 1 to 3 equivalents of diaryl carbonate based on 1 equivalent of<br>
amino group of alkyl polyamine, using an aromatic hydroxy compound for the<br>
reaction solvent, and carrying out the reaction in the state of a substantially<br>
homogeneous solution when producing alkyl polycarbamic acid aryl ester by reacting<br>
alkyl polyamine and diaryl carbonate. According to this patent document, alkyl<br>
polycarbamic acid aryl ester is obtained with high selectivity and at a high yield of<br>
normally 96% or more and 98% or more in preferable embodiments thereof.<br>
However, since the formation of urea compounds has been confirmed, although in<br>
very small amounts, this process is unable to completely avoid the formation of urea<br>
compounds.<br>
[0028]<br>
On the other hand, thermal decomposition of carbamic acid esters is<br>
susceptible to the simultaneous occurrence of various irreversible side reactions such<br>
as thermal denaturation reactions undesirable for carbamic acid esters or<br>
condensation of isocyanates formed by the thermal decomposition. Examples of<br>
these side reactions may include a reaction in which urea bonds are formed as<br>
represented by the following formula (8), a reaction in which carbodiimides are<br>
formed as represented by the following formula (9), and a reaction in which<br>
isocyanurates are formed as represented by the following formula (10) (see,<br>
Non-patent document 4 and Non-patent document 5).<br>
[0029]<br><br>
[0030]<br>
(wherein R and R' independently represent monovalent alkyl groups or aromatic<br>
groups.)<br>
[0031]<br>
In addition to these side reactions leading to a decrease in yield and selectivity<br>
of the target isocyanate, in the production of polyisocyanates in particular, these<br>
reactions may make long-term operation difficult as a result of, for example, causing<br>
the precipitation of polymeric solids that clog the reaction vessel.<br>
[0032]<br>
Various processes have been proposed thus far for producing isocyanates<br>
using a carbamic acid ester for the raw material.<br>
According to Patent document 11, an aromatic diisocyanate and/or<br>
polyisocyanate is produced by going through the following two steps. More<br>
specifically, in the first step, an aromatic primary amine and/or an aromatic primary<br>
polyamine is reacted with an O-alkyl carbamate in the presence or absence of a<br>
catalyst and in the presence or absence of urea and alcohol to form an aryl<br>
diurethane and/or aryl polyurethane followed by removal of the ammonia formed as<br>
necessary. In the second step, an aromatic isocyanate and/or aromatic<br>
polyisocyanate are obtained by thermal decomposition of the aryl diurethane and/or<br>
aryl polyurethane.<br>
[0033]<br>
There are several known methods for forming a corresponding isocyanate and<br>
alcohol by thermal decomposition of a (cyclic) aliphatic, and particularly an aromatic,<br>
monourethane and diurethane, including methods carried out in the gaseous phase<br>
at a high temperature, and methods carried out in a liquid phase under comparatively<br>
low temperature conditions. In these methods, however, the reaction mixture gives<br>
rise to the side reactions described above, thereby causing, for example, the<br>
formation of sediment, polymeric substances and obstructions in the reaction vessel<br>
and recovery apparatus, or the formation of substances that adhere to the sidewalls<br>
of the reaction vessel, thereby resulting in poor economic efficiency in the case of<br>
producing isocyanates over a long period of time.<br>
Thus, the use of a chemical method, such as the use of a special catalyst (see,<br>
for example, Patent document 12 and Patent document 13) or a catalyst combined<br>
with an inert solvent (see, for example, Patent document 14), has been disclosed to<br>
improve the yield in the thermal decomposition of urethane.<br>
[0034]<br>
More specifically, Patent document 15 describes a process for producing<br>
hexamethylene diisocyanate consisting of thermal decomposition of hexamethylene<br>
diethyl urethane in the presence of dibenzyl toluene used as a catalyst and in the<br>
presence of a catalyst mixture composed of methyl toluene sulfonate and diphenyl tin<br>
dichloride. However, since there are no detailed descriptions of production or<br>
isolation of the starting components or purification and arbitrary recovery of the<br>
solvent and catalyst mixture, the economic efficiency of this process could not be<br>
evaluated.<br>
[0035]<br>
According to the method described in Patent document 16, urethane can be<br>
easily broken down into isocyanate and alcohol in a carbon-containing fluidized bed<br>
without using a catalyst. In addition, according to the description of Patent<br>
document 17, hexamethylene dialkyl urethane can be decomposed in the gaseous<br>
phase at a temperature in excess of 300°C in the presence or absence of a gas<br>
permeable packaging material made of, for example, carbon, copper, brass, steel,<br>
zinc, aluminum, titanium, chromium, cobalt or quartz to form hexamethylene<br>
diisocyanate. According to the description of Patent document 16, this method is<br>
carried out in the presence of a hydrogen halide and/or hydrogen halide donor.<br>
However, this method is unable to achieve a yield of hexamethylene diisocyanate of<br>
90% or more. This is because the decomposition products are partially recombined<br>
resulting in the formation of urethane bonds. Thus, the hexamethylene diisocyanate<br>
is required to be additionally purified by distillation, which frequently increases yield<br>
loss.<br>
[0036]<br>
Moreover, according to the description of Patent document 18, a<br>
monocarbamate is disclosed to be able to be decomposed with favorable yield<br>
without using a solvent and in the presence or absence of a catalyst and/or stabilizer<br>
at a comparatively low temperature and advantageously under a reduced pressure.<br>
The decomposition products (monoisocyanate and alcohol) are removed from a<br>
boiling reaction mixture by distillation and separately captured by separative<br>
condensation. A method for removing by-products formed during thermal<br>
decomposition consisting of partially removing the reaction mixture outside the<br>
system is described in a generic form. Thus, although by-products can be removed<br>
from the bottom of the reaction vessel, problems remain with respect to the case of<br>
adherence to the sidewalls of the reaction vessel as previously described, and<br>
problems with respect to long-term operation remain unsolved. In addition, there is<br>
no description regarding industrial utilization of the removed reaction mixture<br>
(containing large amounts of useful components).<br>
[0037]<br>
According to the description of Patent document 19, thermal decomposition of<br>
an aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic polycarbamate is carried out in the presence of an<br>
inert solvent at 150°C to 350°C and 0.001 to 20 bar, and in the presence or absence<br>
of a catalyst and an assistant in the form of hydrogen chloride, organic acid chloride,<br>
alkylation agent or organic tin chloride. By-products formed, can be continuously<br>
removed from the reaction vessel together with the reaction solution, for example,<br>
and a corresponding amount of fresh solvent or recovered solvent is added<br>
simultaneously. A shortcoming of this method is, for example, a reduction in the<br>
space-time yield of polyisocyanate as a result of using a refluxing solvent, while also<br>
requiring considerable energy, including that for recovery of the solvent. Moreover,<br>
the assistants used are volatile under the reaction conditions, resulting in the<br>
potential for contamination of the decomposition products. In addition, the amount<br>
of residue is large based on the formed polyisocyanate, thus leaving room for doubt<br>
regarding economic efficiency and the reliability of industrial methods.<br>
[0038]<br>
According to the description of Patent document 20, a method is described for<br>
continuous thermal decomposition of a carbamate such as the alicyclic diurethane,<br>
5-(ethoxycarbonylamino)-1 -(ethoxycarbonylaminomethyl)-l ,3,3- trimethylcyclohexane,<br>
supplied along the inner surface of a tubular reactor in a liquid form in the presence<br>
of a high boiling point solvent. This method has the shortcomings of low yield during<br>
production of (cyclic) aliphatic diisocyanates and low selectivity. In addition, there is<br>
no description of a continuous method accompanying recovery of recombined or<br>
partially decomposed carbamates, while there is also no mention made of<br>
post-treatment of solvent containing the by-products and catalyst.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0046]<br>
The following provides a detailed explanation of the best mode for carrying out<br>
the present invention (to be referred to as "the present embodiment"). Furthermore,<br>
the present invention is not limited to the following present embodiment, but rather<br>
can be modified in various ways within the scope of the gist thereof.<br>
[0047]<br>
The process of the present embodiment is a process for producing a divalent<br>
aromatic hydroxy compound and an isocyanate compound, which comprises the<br>
steps of: reacting an aromatic polycarbonate resin and an amine compound having<br>
primary amino groups to obtain a mixture containing a carbamic acid ester and a<br>
compound having an aromatic hydroxyl group, which are originated from the<br>
aromatic polycarbonate; and subjecting the carbamic acid ester to a thermal<br>
decomposition reaction to obtain the divalent aromatic hydroxy compound and the<br>
isocyanate compound.<br>
[0048]<br><aromatic polycarbonate><br>
An aromatic polycarbonate used in the present embodiment refers to a polymer<br>
having a carbonic acid ester of a divalent aromatic hydroxy compound as a repetitive<br>
unit thereof, and is represented by the following formula (15):<br>
[0049]<br>
 (15)<br>
[0050]<br>
(wherein Ar represents a divalent aromatic group having 6 to 20 carbon atoms, and k<br>
represents an integer of 0 or more).<br>
[0051]<br>
There are no particular limitations on the Ar constituting the aromatic<br>
polycarbonate, and is an aromatic group having the structure Ar(OH)2, in which two<br>
hydroxyl groups are added to the Ar group, or in other words, an aromatic group in<br>
which two hydroxyl groups have been removed from a divalent aromatic hydroxy<br>
compound. Examples of the divalent aromatic hydroxy compound represented by<br>
Ar(OH)2 may preferably include a divalent aromatic hydroxy compound represented<br>
by the following formula (16):<br>
[0052]<br>
(16)<br>
[0053]<br>
(wherein X represents an alkylidene or cycloalkylidene, which has 1 to 8 carbon<br>
atoms, S, S02, O, C=0 or a single bond, R6 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 5<br>
carbon atoms, CI or Br, and m represents an integer of 0 to 2).<br>
[0054]<br>
Examples of such divalent aromatic hydroxy compounds may include<br>
4,4'-dihydroxydiphenyl, a a a,a'-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-m-diisopropylbenzene,<br>
4,4'-dihydroxydiphenyl a asulfide, a a 2,2-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propane,<br>
2,2-bis-(3,5-dimethyl-4-hyd roxyphenyl)-propane,<br>
2,2-bis-(3,5-dichloro-4-hyd roxyphenyl)-propane,<br>

Among these divalent aromatic hydroxy compounds, 4,4'-dihydroxyphenyl,<br>
a,a'-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-m-diisopropylbenzene, 2,2-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propane<br>
and a1,1-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane aare apreferable,<br>
2,2-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propane is more preferable.<br>
[0055]<br>
The aromatic polycarbonate used in the present embodiment may also be<br>
produced by any polymerization method. Although generally produced by a method<br>
such as interfacial polymerization using phosgene or melt polymerization using<br>
diphenyl carbonate, either method may be used and production is independent of the<br>
production method.<br>
Although there are no particular limitations on the degree of polymerization of<br>
the aromatic polycarbonate provided it has thermoplasticity, the weight average<br>
molecular weight is generally within a range of from 1,000 to 500,000, preferably<br>
within a range of from 5,000 to 200,000, and more preferably within a range of from<br>
10,000 to 80,000. The weight average molecular weight of the aromatic<br>
polycarbonate can be measured by gel permeation chromatography (solvent:<br>
tetrahydrofuran, standard: polystyrene).<br>
[0056]<br>
The aromatic polycarbonate used in the present embodiment may also have a<br>
branched structure as a result of incorporating a multifunctional branching agent in<br>
the molecular chain thereof. Examples of branching agents may include<br>
phloroglucinol, a a a a 4,6-dimethyl-2,4,6-tri-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-heptane,<br>
1,3,5-tri-(4-hydroxyphenylbenzene), a a a1,1,1-tri-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethane,<br>

a,a',a"-tris-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1,3,4-triisopropenyl benzene and the like.<br>
[0057]<br>
In addition, there are cases in which the aromatic polycarbonate contains a<br>
chain terminator and/or a group originated from a chain terminator following the use<br>
of a chain terminator such as phenol, octylphenol (including isomers), cumylphenol<br>
(including isomers) or butylphenol (including isomers) during production thereof, and<br>
even such aromatic polycarbonates can be used in the process of the present<br>
embodiment without any problems whatsoever.<br>
[0058]<br>
Although aromatic polycarbonates are generally used in lenses, compact disks,<br>
construction materials, automobile parts, chasses of OA equipment and camera<br>
bodies and the like, aromatic polycarbonates that have become waste following<br>
completion of use can also be used in the present embodiment. In addition,<br>
aromatic polycarbonates in the form of, for example, waste generated during the<br>
production of moldings, cuttings or moldings no longer able to be used, defective<br>
moldings or aromatic polycarbonates used to clean molding machines can also be<br>
used in the present embodiment. Thus, aromatic polycarbonates may contain<br>
commonly used known additives such as mineral fillers such as quartz powder, glass<br>
powder, glass fibers, stabilizers, UV protectants, lubricants, pigments or dyes, as well<br>
as polymeric blended components using as raw materials thereof styrene,<br>
acrylonitrile or butadiene and the like. In such cases, these aromatic<br>
polycarbonates may be used as is in a state of being contained within a range that<br>
does not impair the essence of the present embodiment, or these aromatic<br>
polycarbonates may be used following the removal of such additives or blended<br>
components by suitable methods. Known methods can be used to remove these<br>
additives and the like, examples of which may include methods such as filtration,<br>
membrane separation, centrifugal separation, precipitation, distillative separation or<br>
crystallization in a state of an aromatic polycarbonate melt or, for example, a solution<br>
containing a solvent to be described later and the aromatic polycarbonate, and<br>
methods using adsorptive separation using, for example, activated charcoal,<br>
diatomaceous earth, cellulose or zeolite.<br>
[0059]<br>
The aromatic polycarbonate used in the present embodiment is preferably used<br>
in a state of being granulated or crushed to a suitable size. From the viewpoint of<br>
allowing the reaction with the polyamine compound to proceed rapidly, the mean<br>
dimension is preferably 10 mm or less, and from the viewpoints of ease of<br>
granulation or crushing and handling ease, preferably 0.5 mm or more. Namely, the<br>
mean dimension is preferably from 0.1 to 10 mm and more preferably from 0.5 to 5<br>
mm.<br>
[0060]<br><amine compound><br>
An amine compound represented by the following formula (17) is used for the<br>
amine compound having primary amino groups used in the present embodiment:<br>
[0061]<br>
 (17)<br>

[0066]<br><reaction of aromatic polycarbonate and amine compound having primary></reaction>
Amino Groups&gt;<br>
Next, an explanation is provided of the reaction between an aromatic<br>
polycarbonate and an amine compound having primary amino groups in the present<br>
embodiment.<br>
Although varying according to the reacted compounds, the reaction conditions<br>
under which the reaction between the aromatic polycarbonate and the amine<br>
compound having primary amino groups is carried out are such that the<br>
stiochiometric ratio of the amino groups of the amine compound to the carbonate<br>
bonds that comprises the aromatic polycarbonate is preferably within a range of from<br>
0.0001 to 2. This stoichiometric ratio is preferably 1 or less, more preferably 0.5 or<br>
less and even more preferably 0.2 or less in order to reduce urea compound<br>
by-products and enhance the yield of the target compound in the form of carbamic<br>
acid ester. In addition, although it is preferable that the amino groups of the amine<br>
compound be as few as possible with respect to carbonate bonds constituting the<br>
aromatic polycarbonate in order to increase the reaction rate and allow the reaction<br>
to rapidly be completed, in consideration of the size of the reactor, the stiochiometric<br>
ratio is more preferably 0.001 or more and even more preferably 0.01 or more.<br>
[0067]<br>
The reaction temperature is generally within a range of from 0 to 300°C.<br>
Although a high temperature is preferable in order to increase the reaction rate, since<br>
undesirable reactions may occur at high temperatures, the reaction temperature is<br>
preferably within a range of from 10°C to 250°C and more preferably within a range<br>
of from 20°C to 200°C. A known cooling apparatus or heating apparatus may be<br>
installed in the reactor used to carry out the reaction in order to maintain a constant<br>
reaction temperature. The reaction is preferably carried out in an inert gas<br>
atmosphere such as nitrogen, helium, argon or neon. In addition, although varying<br>
according to the types of compounds used and reaction temperature, the reaction<br>
may be carried out at decreased pressure, normal pressure or increased pressure,<br>
and the reaction pressure is generally within a range of from 20 to 1 x 10"6 Pa.<br>
There are no particular limitations on the reaction time (residence time in the case of<br>
a continuous process), and is generally from 0.001 to 50 hours, preferably from 0.01<br>
to 20 hours and more preferably from 0.1 to 10 hours. In addition, the reaction can<br>
also be completed after confirming the formation of a desired amount of carbamic<br>
acid ester by liquid chromatography, for example, by sampling the reaction liquid, the<br>
reaction can be completed after confirming that the average degree of polymerization<br>
of aromatic polycarbonate present in the reaction liquid has decreased to a<br>
prescribed value by, for example, gel permeation chromatography, or the reaction<br>
can be completed after confirming that amino groups and/or carbonate groups have<br>
been consumed to a prescribed level by, for example, NMR.<br>
[0068]<br>
In the present embodiment, a catalyst is preferably not used in the reaction<br>
between the aromatic polycarbonate and the amine compound having primary amino<br>
groups. When a carbamic acid ester is heated in the presence of a metal<br>
component derived from a catalyst during transport of the reaction mixture and a<br>
thermal decomposition reaction of carbamic acid ester contained in the reaction<br>
mixture to be described later, a tendency may be observed in which a thermal<br>
denaturation reaction and the like of the carbamic acid ester occurs easily. Although<br>
a catalyst can be used when carrying out the reaction between the aromatic<br>
polycarbonate and the amine compound having primary amino groups, and transfer<br>
of the reaction mixture and a thermal decomposition reaction can be carried out after<br>
going through a step of removing the catalyst, this results in an increase in the<br>
number of steps, thereby making this undesirable.<br>
However, the use of a catalyst is not negated for the purpose of completing the<br>
reaction in a short period of time, lowering the reaction temperature and the like. In<br>
general, since aromatic amine compounds have lower reactivity than aliphatic amines,<br>
in the case of using an aromatic amine compound for the amine compound, the use<br>
of a catalyst may be effective. In the case of using a catalyst, examples of catalysts<br>
that can be used may include organic metal compounds and inorganic metal<br>
compounds of tin, lead, copper or titanium, and basic catalysts such as alcoholates of<br>
alkaline metals or alkaline earth metals in the form of methylates, ethylates or<br>
butyrates (including isomers) of lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium or barium.<br>

Although the reaction between the aromatic hydroxy compounds and the amine<br>
compounds having primary amino groups as described above can be carried out in<br>
the presence or absence of solvent, it is preferably carried out in the presence of a<br>
solvent, and more preferably carried out in a homogeneous solution in the presence<br>
of a solvent. Although there are no particular limitations on the solvent, solvents that<br>
dissolve or swell aromatic polycarbonates are preferable, and examples of solvents<br>
that are used preferably may include aliphatic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran or<br>
1,4-dioxane; aromatic ethers such as diphenyl ether, di(methylphenyl) ether<br>
(including isomers), di(ethylphenyl) ether (including isomers) or di(propylphenyl)<br>
ether; aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene or xylene (including<br>
isomers); aromatic hydroxy compounds such as phenol; and halogen compounds<br>
such as methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride or chlorobenzene.<br>
Among these, aromatic hydroxy compounds are more preferable since they easily<br>
dissolve aromatic polycarbonates and the carbamic acid ester formed, and<br>
demonstrate the effect of inhibiting the occurrence of thermal denaturation reactions<br>
on the carbamic acid ester formed as will be described later.<br>
[0070]<br>
More preferably, the solvent is a monovalent aromatic hydroxy compound<br>
having a single hydroxyl group directly bonded to the aromatic hydrocarbon ring<br>
constituting the aromatic hydroxy compound. Although an aromatic hydroxy<br>
compound having two or more hydroxyl groups bonded directly to the aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon ring constituting the aromatic hydroxy compound can also be used as<br>
an aromatic hydroxy compound constituting the composition of the present<br>
embodiment, since there are cases in which the viscosity of the solution increases in<br>
the reaction between the aromatic polycarbonate and the amine compound, this may<br>
cause a decrease in reaction efficiency or a decrease in efficiency when transferring<br>
the reaction solution to be described later.<br>
[0071]<br>
An aromatic hydroxy compound having at least one substituent R2 as<br>
represented by the following formula (18) is preferable for the monovalent aromatic<br>
hydroxy compound mentioned above:<br>

In addition, the standard boiling point of the monovalent aromatic hydroxy<br>
compound is preferably lower than the standard boiling point of the divalent aromatic<br>
hydroxy compound produced according to the process of the present embodiment.<br>
Although there are cases on which a monovalent aromatic hydroxy compound having<br>
a standard boiling point higher than the standard boiling point of the divalent aromatic<br>
hydroxy compound can be used, in such cases, when the resulting isocyanate<br>
compound and the divalent aromatic hydroxy compound are extracted from a thermal<br>
decomposition reactor in the form of a gaseous phase component in a carbamic acid<br>
ester thermal decomposition step to be described later, there is the risk of a<br>
polymeric polycarbamic acid ester, formed by an addition reaction between the<br>
isocyanate and the divalent aromatic hydroxy compound, adhering to the walls of the<br>
reactor, thereby making this undesirable. There are no particular limitations on the<br>
combination of the monovalent aromatic hydroxy compound and the divalent<br>
aromatic hydroxy compound, and the combination thereof can be arbitrarily selected.<br>
[0078]<br>
There are no particular limitations on the reactor used in the reaction, and a<br>
known reactor can be used. For example, conventionally known reactors such as a<br>
stirring tank, pressurized stirring tank, vacuum stirring tank or column reactor can be<br>
suitably combined and used. There are also no particular limitations on the material<br>
of the reactor, and known materials can be used. Examples of materials that can be<br>
used may include glass, stainless steel, carbon steel, Hastelloy, materials comprising<br>
a base material lined with glass, and those provided with a Teflon coating. Since<br>
there are cases in which corrosion caused by the amine compound and/or aromatic<br>
hydroxy compound can become remarkable depending on the step and conditions, in<br>
such cases, the reactor may be made of glass, have a glass lining or have a Teflon<br>
coating, or a Hastelloy reactors can be suitably selected.<br>
[0079]<br>
The amine compound having primary amino groups is preferably supplied in a<br>
liquid form to the reactor where the reaction between the aromatic hydroxy<br>
compound and the amine compound having primary amino groups is carried out. In<br>
general, many of the previously listed examples of amine compounds are solids at<br>
normal temperatures (for example, 20°C), and although these amine compounds can<br>
be supplied in the liquid form by heating to a temperature higher than the melting<br>
point thereof, since there are cases in which side reactions such as a thermal<br>
denaturation reaction occurs due to heating if the amine compound is supplied at an<br>
excessively high temperature, the amine compound is preferably supplied in the<br>
liquid form at a comparatively low temperature as a mixture with the<br>
above-mentioned aromatic hydroxy compound and water.<br>
[0080]<br><carbamicacid ester and aromatic hydroxy compound obtained by reaction><br>
A mixture containinig a carbamic acid ester and a compound having an<br>
aromatic hydroxyl group, which are originated from the aromatic polycarbonate, is<br>
obtained by the reaction between the aromatic polycarbonate resin and the amine<br>
compound having primary amino groups as previously described. The following<br>
provides an explanation of the carbamic acid ester and the compound having an<br>
aromatic hydroxyl group.<br>
[0081]<br>
In the present embodiment, an aromatic polycarbonate compound is used<br>
having a repetitive unit represented by the following formula (19):<br>
[0082]<br><br>
[0083]<br>
(wherein Ar represents a divalent aromatic group having 6 to 20 carbon atoms, X<br>
represents a terminal end group in a form of a residue of a chain terminator used<br>
when producing the aromatic polycarbonate, or a hydroxyl group, and k represents<br>
an integer of 0 or more); and<br>
[0084]<br>
a compound represented by the following formula (20) is used for the amine<br>
compound having primary amino groups:<br>
[0085]<br>
 (20)<br>
[0086]<br>
(wherein R1 represents a group selected from the group consisting of aliphatic groups<br>
having 1 to 20 carbon atoms and aromatic groups having 6 to 20 carbon atoms, the<br>
above groups contain an atom selected from carbon and oxygen atoms, and have an<br>
atomic number equal to n, and n represents an integer of from 2 to 10).<br>
[0087]<br>
The compound having an aromatic hydroxyl group, which is originated from the<br>
aromatic polycarbonate obtained by carrying out the above reaction, is a compound<br>
represented by the following formula (21) having a structure in which a hydroxyl<br>
group (OH) is added to the Ar group constituting the main chain skeleton of the<br>
repetitive unit:<br>
[0088]<br>
 (21)<br>
[0089]<br>
(wherein Ar represents a group as previously defined, Y represents a terminal end<br>
group X or -OH group as previously defined, and i represents an integer of from 0 to<br>
k).<br>
[0090]<br>
On the other hand, the carbamic acid ester originated from the aromatic<br>
polycarbonate obtained by the above reaction is a compound represented by the<br>
following formula (22):<br>
[0091]<br>
 (22)<br>
[0092]<br>
(wherein, Ar represents a group originated from the aromatic polycarbonate as<br>
previously defined, R1 represents a group originated from the amine compound as<br>
previously defined, h represents an integer of from 0 to k, and n represents a value<br>
as previously defined).<br>
[0093]<br>
In addition, in the reaction between the aromatic polycarbonate and the amine<br>
compound, in the case of using a monovalent aromatic hydroxy compound<br>
represented by the following formula (23) as previously described as a reaction<br>
solvent:<br>
[0095]<br>
(wherein ring A represents an aromatic hydrocarbon ring which has 6 to 20 carbon<br>
atoms and which may have a substituent, and the ring A may be a monocyclic or<br>
heterocyclic ring, and<br>
R2 represents an aliphatic group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, an aliphatic<br>
alkoxy group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, an aryl group having 6 to 20 carbon<br>
atoms, an aryloxy group having 6 to 20 carbon atoms, an aralkyl group having 7 to<br>
20 carbon atoms or an aralkyloxy group having 7 to 20 carbon atoms, the above<br>
groups contain an atom selected from the group consisting of carbon, oxygen and<br>
nitrogen atoms, and R2 may also bond with A to form a ring structure);<br>
[0096]<br>
a transesterification reaction occurs between the aromatic polycarbonate and<br>
the monovalent aromatic hydroxy compound yielding a cleavaged product of the<br>
aromatic polycarbonate as represented by the following formula (24) or formula (25):<br>
[0097]<br>
(24)<br>
 (25)<br>
[0098]<br>
(wherein Ar represents a group originated from the aromatic polycarbonate as<br>

aromatic hydroxy compound as previously defined, X represents the terminal end<br>
group X or -OH group as previously defined, and g represents an integer of from 0 to<br>
k).<br>
[0099]<br>
In such cases, a compound represented by the following formula (26) may be<br>
contained in the form of a carbamic acid ester:<br>
[0100]<br><br>
[0101]<br>
(wherein R1 represents a group originated from the amine compound as previously<br>
defined, A and R2 represent groups originated from the monovalent aromatic hydroxy<br>
compound as previously defined, X represents the terminal end group X or -OH<br>
group as previously defined, f represents an integer of from 0 to k, j represents an<br>
integer of from 1 to n, and n represents a value as previously defined).<br>
[0102]<br>
The following provides a more detailed explanation.<br>
In the case of carrying out the reaction using the aromatic polycarbonate in<br>
which the divalent aromatic hydroxy compound represented by the structure Ar(OH)2,<br>
in which two hydroxyl groups are added to the Ar group in formula (19) above, is<br>
bisphenol A, and the terminal end group X is at least one group selected from the<br>
group consisting of a phenoxy group, p-tert-butylphenoxy group and hydroxyl group,<br>
is used for the aromatic polycarbonate, and a divalent amine compound represented<br>
by the following formula (27) is used for the amine compound:<br>
[0103]<br>
 (27)<br>
[0104]<br>
(wherein R3 represents a group selected from the group consisting of aliphatic groups<br>
having 1 to 20 carbon atoms and aromatic groups having 6 to 20 carbon atoms, the<br>
above groups contain an atoms selected from the group consisting of carbon atoms<br>
and oxygen atoms);<br>
[0105]<br>
a carbamic acid ester produced according to the process of the present<br>
embodiment is a compound represented by the following formula (28):<br>
[0106]<br>
(28)<br>
[0107]<br>
(wherein R3 represents a group selected from the group consisting of aliphatic groups<br>
having 1 to 20 carbon atoms and aromatic groups having 6 to 20 carbon atoms, the<br>
above groups contain an atom selected from the group consisting of carbon atoms<br>
and oxygen atoms, and each of R4 and R5 independently represents a substituent<br>
selected from the group represented by the following formula (29):<br>
[0108]<br>
-OH<br>
[0109]<br>
(wherein each of x, y and z independently represents an integer of 0 or more).<br>
[0120]<br>
The R3 in formula (29) above is a group originated from the above-mentioned<br>
amine compound, and is preferably a group originated from a linear hydrocarbon<br>
group such as methylene, dimethylene, trimethylene, tetramethylene,<br>
pentamethylene, hexamethylene or octamethylene; unsubstituted acyclic<br>
hydrocarbon groups such as cyclopentane, cyclohexane, cycloheptane, cyclooctane<br>
or bis(cyclohexyl)alkane; alkyl-substituted cyclohexanes such as methylcyclopentane,<br>
ethylcyclopentane, methylcyclohexane (including isomers), ethylcyclohexane<br>
(including isomers), propylcyclohexane (including isomers), butylcyclohexane<br>
(including isomers), pentylcyclohexane (including isomers) or hexylcyclohexane<br>
(including isomers); dialkyl-substituted cyclohexanes such as dimethylcyclohexane<br>
(including isomers), diethylcyclohexane (including isomers) or dibutylcyclohexane<br>
(including isomers); trialkyl-substituted cyclohexanes such as<br>
1,5,5-trimethylcyclohexane, 1,5,5-triethylcyclohexane, 1,5,5-tripropylcyclohexane<br>
(including isomers) or 1,5,5-tributylcyclohexane (including isomers);<br>
monoalkyl-substituted benzenes such as toluene, ethylbenzene or propylbenzene;<br>
dialkyl-substituted benzenes such as xylene, diethylbenzene or dipropylbenzene; and<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons such as diphenylalkane or benzene. Particularly preferable<br>
examples may include hexamethylene, phenylene, diphenylmethane, toluene,<br>
cyclohexane, xylene, methylcyclohexane, isophorone and cyclohexylmethane groups.<br>
Namely, groups originated from aliphatic diamines such as hexamethylene diamine,<br>
4,4'-methylenebis(cyclohexylamine) (including isomers), cyclohexane diamine<br>
(including isomers) or 3-aminomethyl-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexyl amine (including<br>
isomers); and aromatic diamines such as phenylene diamine (including isomers),<br>
toluene diamine (including isomers) or 4,4'-methylenedianiline (including isomers) are<br>
preferable, while groups originated from aliphatic diamines such as hexamethylene<br>
diamine, 4,4'-methylenebis(cyclohexylamine) (including isomers), cyclohexane<br>
diamine (including isomers) or 3-aminomethyl-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexyl amine<br>
(including isomers) are particularly preferable, while groups originated from<br>
hexamethylene a diamine, a 4,4'-methylenebis a (cyclohexylamine) a or<br>
3-aminomethyl-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexyl amine are more preferable.<br>
[0111]<br>
The carbamic acid ester is preferably used as a raw material for producing an<br>
isocyanate compound in particular. Although the details thereof will be described<br>
later, an isocyanate and divalent aromatic hydroxy compound (bisphenol A) are<br>
formed by subjecting the carbamic acid ester to a thermal decomposition reaction.<br>
The bisphenol A unexpectedly demonstrates the effect of improving the yield of<br>
isocyanate by inhibiting thermal denaturation of the carbamic acid ester represented<br>
by formula (8) above. In addition, since the boiling point of bisphenol A is higher<br>
than that of the isocyanate compound formed, the isocyanate can be recovered in<br>
the form of a gaseous phase component while the bisphenol A can be recovered in<br>
the form of a liquid phase component, thereby facilitating separation of the thermal<br>
decomposition products. Moreover, since the bisphenol A dissolves by-products<br>
from the thermal denaturation reaction as represented by, for example, the formulas<br>
(8) and/or (9) and/or (10) above attributable to the carbamic acid ester and/or the<br>
thermal decomposition product in the form of the isocyanate, by-products from the<br>
thermal denaturation reaction can be expelled from the reactor where the thermal<br>
decomposition reaction is carried out in the form of a solution of bisphenol A, thereby<br>
making it possible to prevent adherence and accumulation on the walls of the reactor<br>
while also enabling operation of the isocyanate production process based on a<br>
thermal decomposition reaction over a long period of time.<br>
[0112]<br><transfer of reaction liquid><br>
The reaction liquid containing carbamic acid ester produced by the process<br>
according to the present embodiment is preferably removed from the reactor where<br>
the reaction was carried out and transferred to a reaction where the thermal<br>
decomposition reaction is carried out on the carbamic acid ester (to be referred to as<br>
"the thermal decomposition reactor") followed by carrying out the thermal<br>
decomposition reaction on the carbamic acid ester. In this manner, by using<br>
separator reactors for the reactor where the carbarnic acid ester is produced and the<br>
thermal decomposition reactor, a suitable reactor can be selected for each reaction<br>
and the reaction conditions can be flexibly set, thereby making it possible to enhance<br>
the yield of each reaction.<br>
[0113]<br>
Since these carbamic acid esters easily form intermolecular hydrogen bonds by<br>
bonding urethane constituting the carbamic acid esters, they frequently have a high<br>
melting point. In the transfer of such carbamic acid esters, for example, a solid<br>
carbamic acid ester can be transferred after subjecting to excipiation treatment such<br>
as by crushing or forming into pellets. However, in the case of transferring a solid<br>
carbamic acid ester that has been subjected to excipiation treatment, there are many<br>
cases in which a complex apparatus for stably transferring a fixed amount of<br>
carbamic acid ester is required or a step is required for unifying the form of the<br>
carbamic acid ester within a certain range is required in cases of frequent clogging of<br>
the transfer line or variations in the form of the carbamic acid ester. Thus, the<br>
carbamic acid ester is preferably supplied to the thermal decomposition reactor in a<br>
liquid form.<br>
[0114]<br>
The method used to supply the carbamic acid ester to the thermal<br>
decomposition reactor in the liquid form can preferably employ a method in which it is<br>
supplied in the form of a reaction mixture obtained by reaction of the aromatic<br>
polycarbonate and the amine compound having primary amino groups.<br>
The inventors of the present invention unexpectedly found that when the<br>
carbamic acid ester is transferred in the form of a mixture with an aromatic hydroxy<br>
compound, reductions in carbamic acid ester caused by thermal denaturation of the<br>
carbamic acid ester and the like as well as decreases in yield of the isocyanate<br>
compound can be inhibited. Although the reason for demonstrating this effect is<br>
uncertain, the inventors of the present invention presumed that, in a reaction that<br>
forms urea bonds as represented by the formula (8) above, as a result of urethane<br>
bonds (-NHCOO-) of the carbamic acid ester and the aromatic hydroxy compound<br>
contained in the reaction mixture forming hydrogen bonds, since the urethane bonds<br>
are formed in a state in which it is difficult for them to approach each other, it is<br>
difficult for the reaction resulting in the formation of urea bonds to occur.<br>
[0115]<br>
There are no particular limitations on the method used to obtain a mixture of the<br>
carbamic acid ester and the aromatic hydroxy compound, and for example, the<br>
carbamic acid ester obtained by the reaction between the aromatic polycarbonate<br>
and the amine compound having primary amino groups as previously described may<br>
be separated and recovered by the known method such as crystallization, distillative<br>
separation or membrane separation followed by mixing the carbamic acid ester and<br>
the aromatic hydroxy compound. In addition, the aromatic hydroxy compound may<br>
be added and mixed with a mixture containing the carbamic acid ester obtained by<br>
reacting the aromatic polycarbonate and the amine compound having primary amino<br>
groups.<br>
[0116]<br>
Alternatively, a reaction mixture containing the carbamic acid ester and the<br>
aromatic hydroxy compound, obtained by carrying out the reaction between the<br>
aromatic polycarbonate and the amine compound having primary amino groups as<br>
described above using the aromatic hydroxy compound as a reaction solvent, may<br>
be used directly. Since this method enables the reaction mixture to be transferred<br>
directly, the process is simplified, thereby making this more preferable.<br>
[0117]<br>
The transfer of the mixture is preferably carried out within a temperature range<br>
of from 10°C to 180°C, more preferably within a range of from 70°C to 170°C and<br>
even more preferably within a range of from 100°C to 150°C. If the temperature is<br>
excessively high, the effect of the aromatic hydroxy compound of inhibiting thermal<br>
denaturation of the carbamic acid ester tends to be difficult to obtain, while on the<br>
other hand, if the temperature is excessively low, the viscosity of the mixture<br>
increases, which may cause problems during transfer.<br>
[0118]<br><thermal decomposition of carbamic acid ester><br>
The following provides an explanation of the production of the isocyanate and<br>
divalent aromatic hydroxy compound by thermal decomposition of the carbamic acid<br>
ester.<br>
The thermal decomposition reaction of the present embodiment is a reaction for<br>
forming the corresponding isocyanate compound from the carbamic acid ester. In<br>
particular, the divalent aromatic hydroxy compound is formed simultaneous to the<br>
isocyanate from a carbamic acid ester in which h and g are both 0 in the<br>
above-mentioned formula (22) or formula (26).<br>
[0119]<br>
The reaction temperature is generally within a range of from 100 to 300°C, and<br>
although a high temperature is preferable to increase the reaction rate, on the other<br>
hand, since there are cases in which side reactions as previously described may be<br>
induced at high temperatures depending on the carbamic acid ester and/or product in<br>
the form of the isocyanate compound, the reaction temperature is preferably within a<br>
range of from 150 to 250°C. A known cooling apparatus or heating apparatus may<br>
be installed to maintain a constant reaction temperature. In addition, although<br>
varying according to the types of compounds used and the reaction temperature, the<br>
reaction pressure is such that the reaction may be carried out at decreased pressure,<br>
normal pressure or increased pressure, and the reaction is generally carried out<br>
within a range of from 20 to 1 x 106 Pa. There are no particular limitations on the<br>
reaction time (residence time in the case of a continuous process), and is generally<br>
within a range of from 0.001 to 100 hours, preferably within a range of from 0.005 to<br>
50 hours and more preferably within a range of from 0.01 to 10 hours.<br>
[0120]<br>
A catalyst is preferably not used in the present embodiment. Although the<br>
thermal decomposition reaction may be promoted by using a catalyst, this is not<br>
preferable since there are many cases in which there is increased susceptibility to<br>
the occurrence of side reactions attributable to the carbamic acid ester and/or<br>
product isocyanate compound as previously described.<br>
[0121]<br>
The above-mentioned side reactions may occur in the case a carbamic acid<br>
ester is held for a long time at a high temperature. In addition, the isocyanate<br>
compound formed by the thermal decomposition reaction may also cause side<br>
reactions as previously described. Thus, the time during which the carbamic acid<br>
ester and the isocyanate compound are held at a high temperature is preferably as<br>
short as possible, and the thermal decomposition reaction is preferably carried out<br>
with a continuous process. A continuous process refers to a process in which the<br>
mixture containing the carbamic acid ester is continuously supplied to the reactor and<br>
subjected to the thermal decomposition reaction, and the resulting isocyanate<br>
compound and divalent aromatic hydroxy compound are continuously extracted from<br>
the thermal decomposition reactor. In this continuous process, low boiling point<br>
components formed by thermal decomposition of carbamic acid ester are preferably<br>
recovered from the top of the thermal decomposition reactor in the form of a gaseous<br>
phase component, while the remainder is recovered from the bottom of the thermal<br>
decomposition reactor in the form of a liquid phase component. Here, low boiling<br>
point components include the isocyanate compound and/or the reaction solvent in the<br>
form of the monovalent aromatic hydroxy compound. Although all compounds<br>
present in the thermal decomposition reactor can be recovered in the form of a<br>
gaseous phase component, the presence of a liquid component in the thermal<br>
decomposition reactor has the effect of preventing adherence and accumulation of<br>
polymeric compounds on the thermal decomposition reactor by dissolving polymeric<br>
compounds formed by side reactions induced by the carbamic acid ester and/or<br>
isocyanate compound. Although an isocyanate compound and divalent aromatic<br>
hydroxy compound are formed by thermal decomposition of the carbamic acid ester,<br>
at least one of these compounds is recovered in the form of a gaseous phase<br>
component. Although which of these compounds is recovered in the form of a<br>
gaseous phase component is dependent on the conditions of the thermal<br>
decomposition reaction, from the viewpoint of obtaining a highly pure isocyanate<br>
compound, the isocyanate compound is preferably extracted in the form of a gaseous<br>
phase component. In the case the carbamic acid ester is subjected to the thermal<br>
decomposition reaction after being supplied to the thermal decomposition reactor in<br>
the form of a mixture with the aromatic hydroxy compound as previously described,<br>
although whether the aromatic hydroxy compound is recovered as a gaseous phase<br>
component or a liquid phase component depends on the conditions of the thermal<br>
decomposition reaction, it is preferably recovered in the form of a gaseous phase<br>
component from the viewpoint of avoiding the carbamic acid ester being formed by<br>
reacting an isocyanate compound and the aromatic hydroxy compound, and the<br>
carbamic acid ester being recovered together with the isocyanate.<br>
[0122]<br>
For example, a method can be employed whereby the isocyanate compound<br>
formed by the thermal decomposition reaction and the aromatic hydroxy compound<br>
are recovered in the form of a gaseous phase component, and a liquid component is<br>
recovered containing the divalent aromatic hydroxy compound and/or the carbamic<br>
acid ester. In this method, the isocyanate compound and the aromatic hydroxy<br>
compound may also be recovered separately in the thermal decomposition reactor.<br>
The gaseous phase component containing the recovered isocyanate compound is<br>
preferably supplied to a distillation apparatus for separating and purifying the<br>
isocyanate compound in the gaseous phase. Although the gaseous phase<br>
component containing the recovered isocyanate compound can be supplied to a<br>
distillation apparatus after being transformed to the liquid phase by a condenser and<br>
the like, there are many cases in which the apparatus becomes complex and the<br>
amount of energy used increases, thereby making this undesirable. On the other<br>
hand, the liquid phase component containing the divalent aromatic hydroxy<br>
compound and/or the carbamic acid ester is recovered from the bottom of the<br>
thermal decomposition reactor, and in the case the liquid phase component contains<br>
carbamic acid ester, all or a portion of the liquid phase component is supplied to the<br>
top of the thermal decomposition reactor after which the carbamic acid ester is<br>
resubjected to the thermal decomposition reaction. The top of the thermal<br>
decomposition reactor as referred to here indicates, for example, the level of the<br>
second plate or higher from the bottom in terms of the number of theoretical plates in<br>
the case the thermal decomposition reactor is a distillation column, and in the case<br>
the thermal decomposition reactor is a thin film distiller, indicates the portion higher<br>
than the heated transfer surface. When supplying all or a portion of the liquid phase<br>
component to the top of the thermal decomposition reactor, the liquid phase<br>
component is transferred while preferably maintaining at 10 to 300°C, more<br>
preferably 30°C to 250°C and even more preferably 50°C to 120°C. In addition,<br>
when re-supplying all or a portion of the liquid phase component to the thermal<br>
decomposition reactor, this may be carried out after having removed all or a portion<br>
of the divalent aromatic hydroxy compound contained in the liquid phase component.<br>
[0123]<br>
In addition, a method can also be employed whereby, for example, the<br>
isocyanate compound formed by the thermal decomposition reaction is recovered in<br>
the form of a gaseous phase component, while a liquid phase component is<br>
recovered containing the aromatic hydroxy compound, divalent aromatic hydroxy<br>
compound and/or carbamic acid ester. The gaseous phase component containing<br>
the recovered isocyanate compound is preferably supplied in the gaseous phase to a<br>
distillation apparatus for separating and purifying the isocyanate. Although the<br>
gaseous phase component containing the recovered isocyanate compound can be<br>
supplied to a distillation apparatus after transforming to a liquid phase by a<br>
condenser and the like, there are many cases in which the apparatus becomes<br>
complex and the amount of energy used increases, thereby making this undesirable.<br>
On the other hand, the liquid phase component containing the aromatic hydroxy<br>
compound, divalent aromatic hydroxy compound and/or carbamic acid ester is<br>
recovered from the bottom of the thermal decomposition reactor, and in the case the<br>
liquid phase component contains carbamic acid ester, all or a portion of the liquid<br>
phase component is preferably supplied to the top of the thermal decomposition<br>
reactor after which the carbamic acid ester is resubjected to the thermal<br>
decomposition reaction. When supplying all or a portion of the liquid phase<br>
component to the top of the thermal decomposition reactor, the liquid phase<br>
component is transferred while preferably maintaining at 10°C to 300°C, more<br>
preferably 30°C to 250°C and even more preferably 50°C to 120°C. In addition,<br>
when re-supplying all or a portion of the liquid phase component to the thermal<br>
decomposition reactor, this may be carried out after having removed all or a portion<br>
of the divalent aromatic hydroxy compound and after removing all or a portion of the<br>
aromatic hydroxy compound from the liquid phase component.<br>
[0124]<br>
Although previously described, the liquid phase component is preferably<br>
recovered from the bottom of the thermal decomposition reactor in the thermal<br>
decomposition reaction. This is because, by allowing the liquid phase component to<br>
be present in the thermal decomposition reactor, the liquid phase component<br>
dissolves polymeric by-products formed by side reactions induced by the carbamic<br>
acid ester and/or isocyanate, thereby enabling these by-products to be expelled from<br>
the thermal decomposition reactor in the form of a liquid phase component and<br>
resulting in the effect of reducing adherence and accumulation of the polymeric<br>
compounds in the thermal decomposition reactor.<br>
[0125]<br>
In the case carbamic acid ester is contained in the liquid phase component,<br>
although all or a portion of the liquid phase component is supplied to the top of the<br>
thermal decomposition reactor and the carbamic acid ester is resubjected to the<br>
thermal decomposition reaction, repetition of this step may result in the accumulation<br>
of polymeric by-products in the liquid phase component. In such cases, all or a<br>
portion of the liquid phase component can be removed from the reaction system,<br>
thereby reducing accumulation of polymeric by-products or maintaining at a fixed<br>
concentration thereof.<br>
[0126]<br>
The aromatic hydroxy compound obtained in the above process can be<br>
recovered by separation and reused as a reaction solvent during production of the<br>
carbamic acid ester and/or as a solvent used during transfer of the mixture containing<br>
the carbamic acid ester and/or as a solvent in the carbamic acid ester thermal<br>
decomposition reaction.<br>
[0127]<br>
In addition, the isocyanate recovered by the above process can be purified by<br>
the known method such as distillative separation or membrane separation. In<br>
addition, the divalent aromatic hydroxy compound recovered after going through the<br>
above process can be purified by the method such as distillative separation, film<br>
separation or crystallization.<br>
[0128]<br>
Although there are no particular limitations on the type of the thermal<br>
decomposition reactor, the known distillation apparatus is used preferably in order to<br>
efficiency recover the gaseous phase component. Various known methods are used<br>
for such a reactor, examples of which may include types using reactors containing a<br>
distillation column, multistage distillation column, multitubular reactor, continuous<br>
multistage distillation column, packed column, thin film evaporator, reactor provided<br>
with a support inside, forced circulation reactor, falling film evaporator, falling drop<br>
evaporator, and types using combinations thereof. Methods using a tubular reactor<br>
are preferable from the viewpoint of rapidly removing low boiling point components<br>
from the reaction system, while a structure having a large gas-liquid contact area is<br>
preferable for being able to rapidly transfer the low boiling point components formed<br>
to the gaseous phase.<br>
[0129]<br>
Although the material of the thermal decomposition reactor and lines may be<br>
any known material provided it does not have a detrimental effect on the carbamic<br>
acid ester, divalent aromatic hydroxy compound or isocyanate and the like, materials<br>
such as SUS304, SUS316 or SUS316L are inexpensive and can therefore be used<br>
preferably.<br>
[0130]<br><cleaning of thermal decomposition reactor><br>
In the present embodiment, there are cases in which the reaction liquid<br>
containing carbamic acid ester obtained by reacting the aromatic polycarbonate and<br>
the amine compound having primary amino groups contains polymeric side reaction<br>
products represented by, for example, the above-mentioned formula (8), (9) and (10).<br>
Since these side reaction products easily dissolve in the aromatic hydroxy compound<br>
in many cases, they are dissolved in the reaction liquid containing the aryl carbamate.<br>
However, if the majority of the aromatic hydroxy compound is extracted from the<br>
thermal decomposition reactor in the form of a gaseous phase component, the side<br>
reaction products end up precipitating in the thermal decomposition reactor and<br>
frequency adhere thereto. When these compounds that have adhered to the<br>
thermal decomposition reactor accumulated to a certain degree, they may impair<br>
operation of the thermal decomposition reactor and make long-term operation difficult,<br>
thereby resulting in the need to disassemble and clean the thermal decomposition<br>
reactor.<br>
[0131]<br>
The inventors of the present invention unexpectedly found that compound<br>
adhered to the thermal decomposition reactor easily dissolve in an aromatic hydroxy<br>
compound. On the basis of this finding, in the case side reaction product have<br>
adhered to the thermal decomposition reactor, the inventors of the present invention<br>
proposed and perfected a method for keeping the inside of the thermal<br>
decomposition reactor clean by cleaning the walls of the thermal decomposition<br>
reactor with an aromatic hydroxy compound to dissolve these side reaction products<br>
and remove them from the thermal decomposition reactor. As a result of employing<br>
this method, since the walls of the thermal decomposition reactor can be cleaned<br>
without having to disassemble and separately clean the thermal decomposition<br>
reactor, the downtime of the thermal decomposition reactor can be minimized,<br>
thereby resulting in high isocyanate production efficiency.<br>
[0132]<br>
There are no particular limitations on the cleaning solvent provided it dissolves<br>
the polymeric by-products, and although an organic acid or inorganic acid may be<br>
used, organic acid is used preferably. Although examples of organic acids may<br>
include carboxylic acid, sulfonic acid, sulfinic acid, phenols, enols, thiophenols,<br>
imides, oximes and aromatic sulfonamides, carboxylic acid and phenols are used<br>
preferably. Examples of such compounds may include saturated or unsaturated<br>
aliphatic monocarboxylic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid,<br>
n-butyric acid, isobutyric acid, valeric acid, isovaleric acid, 2-methylbutanoic acid,<br>
pivalic acid, hexanoic acid, isocaproic acid, 2-ethylbutanoic acid,<br>
2,2-dimethylbutanoic acid, heptanoic acid (including isomers), octanoic acid<br>
(including isomers), nonanoic acid (including isomers), decanoic acid (including<br>
isomers), undecanoic acid (including isomers), dodecanoic acid (including isomers),<br>
tetradecanoic acid (including isomers), hexadecanoic acid (including isomers), acrylic<br>
acid, crotonic acid, isocrotonic acid, vinyl acetate, methacrylic acid, angelic acid, tiglic<br>

maleic acid, fumaric acid, methylmaleic acid, methylfumaric acid, pentene diacid<br>
(including isomers), itaconic acid or allylmalonic acid; saturated or unsaturated<br>
aliphatic tricarboxylic acids such as 1,2,3-propane tricarboxylic acid, 1,2,3-propene<br>
tricarboxylic acid or 2,3-dimethylbutane-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid; aromatic carboxylic<br>
acids such as benzoic acid, methylbenzoic acid (including isomers), ethylbenzoic<br>
acid (including isomers), propyl benzoic acid (including isomers), dimethylbenzoic<br>
acid (including isomers) or trimethylbenzoic acid (including isomers); aromatic<br>
dicarboxylic acids such as phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid or<br>
methylisophthalic acid (including isomers); aromatic tricarboxylic acids such as<br>
hemimellitic acid, trimellitic acid or trimesinic acid; and aromatic hydroxy compounds<br>
such as phenol. Among these, aromatic hydroxy compounds are preferable in<br>
consideration of the solubility of the polymeric by-products and effects in the case of<br>
the cleaning solvent remaining in the thermal decomposition reactor. Examples of<br>
such aromatic hydroxy compounds may include mono-substituted phenols such as<br>
phenol, methylphenol (including isomers), ethylphenol (including isomers),<br>
propylphenol (including isomers), butylphenol (including isomers), pentylphenol<br>
(including isomers), hexylphenol (including isomers), heptylphenol (including<br>
isomers), octylphenol (including isomers), nonylphenol (including isomers),<br>

same type as the aromatic hydroxy compound used in the reaction between the<br>
aromatic polycarbonate and the amine compound having primary amino groups is<br>
more preferable in consideration of the case of the cleaning solvent remaining after<br>
cleaning the thermal decomposition reactor.<br>
[0133]<br>
Various methods can be used to clean the thermal decomposition reactor using<br>
the cleaning solvents listed above, examples of which may include a method<br>
whereby the thermal decomposition reactor is cleaned by introducing cleaning<br>
solvent from the top of the thermal decomposition reactor, and a method whereby the<br>
inside of the thermal decomposition reactor is cleaned by introducing cleaning<br>
solvent into the bottom of the thermal decomposition reactor and heating up the<br>
cleaning solvent inside the thermal decomposition reactor.<br>
[0134]<br>
There are no particular limitations on the frequency at which cleaning is carried<br>
out, and the cleaning frequency can be arbitrarily determined according to the<br>
compounds used, operating rate and the like. The thermal decomposition reactor<br>
may also be provided with a line for introducing cleaning solvent in the thermal<br>
decomposition reactor.<br>
[0135]<br>
In addition, when carrying out thermal decomposition of carbamic acid ester,<br>
the above-mentioned cleaning solvent can also be made to be present under the<br>
conditions of the thermal decomposition reaction for the purpose of cleaning the<br>
thermal decomposition reactor. This differs from the inert solvent as referred to in<br>
the prior art (see, for example, US Patent No. 4081472). For example, according to<br>
this patent document, although an inert solvent refers to a compound that does not<br>
react with isocyanate formed by thermal decomposition of carbamic acid ester, in<br>
contrast, as described in, for example, the Journal of the American Chemical Society,<br>
Vol. 64, p. 2229, 1942 that urethane is formed by the reaction of an aromatic hydroxy<br>
compound and phenyl isocyanate, aromatic hydroxy compounds are able to react<br>
with isocyanates. The aromatic hydroxy compound may be supplied to the thermal<br>
decomposition reactor after mixing when transferring the reaction mixture obtained by<br>
a reaction between diaryl carbonate and an amine compound to the thermal<br>
decomposition reactor, or may be supplied by providing a line for supplying the<br>
aromatic hydroxy compound separate from the line for supplying the reaction mixture.<br>
[0136]<br>
The carbamic acid ester obtained in the process of the present embodiment is<br>
preferable as a raw material for producing isocyanate without using extremely toxic<br>
phosgene, and isocyanate obtained with the process of the present embodiment can<br>
be preferably used as a raw material for the production of polyurethane foam, paints,<br>
adhesives and the like. In addition, the divalent aromatic hydroxy compound<br>
obtained in the process of the present embodiment can be preferably used as a raw<br>
material for the production of aromatic polycarbonates. The process of the present<br>
embodiment also demonstrates the aspect of chemical recycling of aromatic<br>
polycarbonates. On the basis of the above, the present invention is industrially<br>
extremely important.<br>

Example 1<br>
Step (1-1): Preparation of Mixture of Aromatic Polycarbonate and Aromatic<br>
Hydroxy Compound<br>
A mixture was prepared using an apparatus like that shown in FIG 1.<br>
20.6 kg (100 mol) of molten 4-t-octylphenol (Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.,<br>
Japan) were transferred from a storage tank 101 to a reactor 102 heated to 200°C<br>
after replacing the inside thereof with nitrogen with a line 12 closed. 14.3 kg of<br>
bisphenol A polycarbonate (Aldrich Corp., USA, weight average molecular weight:<br>
65,000) were loaded into the reactor 102 from a storage tank 100 and stirred. After<br>
confirming that the bisphenol A polycarbonate had dissolved, line 12 was opened and<br>
the mixture was transferred to a storage tank 103.<br>
Step (1-2): Production of CarbamicAcid Ester<br>
A reaction was carried out using an apparatus like that shown in FIG. 2.<br>
In a state where a line 23 was closed, the mixture produced in step (1-1) was<br>
supplied at a rate of 4.15 kg / hr via a line 21 from storage tank 103 to a baffled SUS<br>
reactor 202 maintained at about 150°C after replacing the inside thereof with nitrogen.<br>
Hexamethylene diamine (Aldrich Corp., USA) was supplied at a rate of about 0.24 kg<br>
/ hr via a line 22 from a storage tank 201 to the reactor 202. After analyzing the<br>
reaction liquid by gas chromatography and confirming that hexamethylene diamine<br>
was no longer detected, the line 23 was opened and the reaction liquid was<br>
transferred to a storage tank 203 via line 23.<br>
Step (1-3): Production of Isocyanate by Thermal Decomposition of Carbamic<br>
Acid Ester<br>
A reaction was carried out using an apparatus like that shown in FIG. 3.<br>
A thin film distillation apparatus 301 (Kobelco Eco-Solutions Co., Ltd., Japan)<br>
having a heat-conducting surface area of 0.1 m2 was heated to 220°C, and an<br>
internal pressure was set to about 13 kPa. The mixture recovered in storage tank<br>
203 in step (1-2) was heated to 150°C and supplied to the top of the thin film<br>
distillation apparatus 301 at a rate of about 1120 g / hr via a line 31. A liquid phase<br>
component was extracted from a line 32 from the bottom of the thin film distillation<br>
apparatus 301 and circulated to the top of the thin film distillation apparatus 301 via a<br>
line 36. A gaseous phase component was extracted from a line 33 from the thin film<br>
distillation apparatus 301 and supplied to a continuous multistage distillation column<br>
302.<br>
The gaseous phase component extracted via the line 33 from the thin film<br>
distillation apparatus 301 was continuously fed to an intermediate stage of the<br>
continuous multistage distillation column 302 having an inner diameter of about 5 cm<br>
and column length of 2 m and packed with Dixon packing (diameter: 6 mm) to carry<br>
out distillative separation of the gaseous phase component. The amount of heat<br>
required for distillative separation was supplied by circulating the liquid in the bottom<br>
of the column through a line 39 and a reboiler 305. The liquid temperature in the<br>
bottom of the continuous multistage distillation column 302 was 150°C, and the<br>
pressure at the top of the column was about 15 kPa. A liquid phase component was<br>
extracted from the line 33 of the continuous multistage distillation column 302<br>
provided at a location lower than a line 32 and supplied to a continuous multistage<br>
distillation column 312. The continuous multistage distillation column 312 was a<br>
continuous multistage distillation column having an inner diameter of about 5 cm and<br>
column length of 2 m packed with Dixon packing (diameter: 6 mm), and was used to<br>
carry out distillative separation of the liquid phase component extracted from the<br>
continuous multistage distillation column 302 with this distillation column. The<br>
amount of heat required for distillative separation was supplied by circulating liquid in<br>
the bottom of the column through a line 41 and a reboiler 310. The liquid<br>
temperature in the bottom of the multistage continuous distillation column 312 was<br>
170°C, and the pressure at the top of the column was about 15 kPa. Gas distilled<br>
from the top of the continuous multistage distillation column 312 was condensed in a<br>
condenser 308 via a line 34, continuously extracted from a line 35 at the rate of about<br>
89 g/hr and recovered in a storage tank 309. Liquid extracted from line 35 was a<br>
solution containing about 99.8% by weight of hexamethylene diisocyanate, and the<br>
yield based on hexamethylene diamine was about 85%.<br>

column 313 having an inner diameter of about 5 cm and a column length of 2 m and<br>
packed with Dixon packing (diameter: 6 mm) to carry out separative distillation of the<br>
liquid phase component. The amount of heat required for distillative separation was<br>
supplied by circulating a portion of the liquid in the bottom of the column through a<br>
line 45 and a reboiler 315. The liquid temperature of the liquid in the bottom of<br>
continuous multistage distillation column 313 was 260°C and the pressure at the top<br>
of column was about 1.3 kPa. Gas distilled from the top of continuous multistage<br>
distillation column 313 was condensed in a condenser 316 via a line 44 and<br>
continuously extracted into a storage tank 316 via a line 46.<br>
A liquid phase component was extracted from a line 48 of the continuous<br>
multistage distillation column 313 provided at a location lower than a line 43 and<br>
supplied to a continuous multistage distillation column 318.<br>
The liquid phase component supplied to the continuous multistage distillation<br>
column 318 via the line 48 was separated by distillation in that distillation column.<br>
The liquid temperature at the bottom of the continuous multistage distillation column<br>
318 was 240°C and the pressure at the top of the column was about 0.5 kPa. Gas<br>
distilled from the top of the distillation column 318 was condensed in a condenser<br>
319 via a line 49 and continuously extracted at a rate of about 180 g / hr into a<br>
storage tank 309 via a line 50.<br>
Liquid extracted from line 46 was a solution containing about 99% by weight of<br>
4-t-octylphenol. In addition, liquid extracted from line 50 was a liquid containing<br>
about 99% by weight of bisphenol A.<br>

having a heat-conducting surface area of 0.1 m2 was heated to 280°C, and the<br>
internal pressure was set to about 0.5 kPa. The mixture recovered in storage tank<br>
203 in step (13-2) was heated to 180°C and supplied to the top of the thin film<br>
distillation apparatus 401 at a rate of about 2210 g / hr via a line 61. A portion of a<br>
liquid phase component extracted from the bottom of the thin film distillation<br>
apparatus 401 was circulated to the top of the thin film distillation apparatus 401 via a<br>
line 66 and a line 60, while the remainder was extracted into a storage tank 407. On<br>
the other hand, a gaseous phase component was extracted from a line 62 and<br>
supplied to a continuous multistage distillation column 402.<br>
The gaseous phase component extracted via the line 62 from the thin film<br>
distillation apparatus 401 was continuously fed to the intermediate stage of the<br>
continuous multistage distillation column 402 having an inner diameter of about 5 cm<br>
and a column length of 2 m and packed with Dixon packing (diameter: 6 mm) to carry<br>
out distillative separation of the gaseous phase component. The amount of heat<br>
required for distillative separation was supplied by circulating the liquid in the bottom<br>
of the column through a line 69 and a reboiler 405. The liquid temperature in the<br>
bottom of the continuous multistage distillation column 402 was 220°C, and the<br>

phase component supplied from the continuous multistage distillation column 402<br>
was carried out with this distillation column. The amount of heat required for<br>
distillative separation was supplied by circulating liquid in the bottom of the column<br>
through a line 71 and a reboiler 410. The liquid temperature in the bottom of the<br>
multistage continuous distillation column 412 was 230°C, and the pressure at the top<br>
of the column was about 0.5 kPa. Gas distilled from the top of the continuous<br>
multistage distillation column 412 was condensed in a condenser 408 via a line 64,<br>
continuously extracted from a line 65 at a rate of about 105 g / hr and recovered in a<br>
storage tank 409.<br>
Liquid extracted from the line 65 was a solution containing about 99% by weight<br>

continuously fed to an intermediate stage of a continuous multistage distillation<br>
column 413 having an inner diameter of about 5 cm and a column length of 2 m and<br>
packed with Dixon packing (diameter: 6 mm) to carry out separative distillation of the<br>
liquid phase component. The amount of heat required for distillative separation was<br>
supplied by circulating a portion of the liquid in the bottom of the column through a<br>
line 75 and a reboiler 415. The liquid temperature of the liquid in the bottom of<br>
continuous multistage distillation column 413 was 170°C and the pressure at the top<br>
of column was about 1.3 kPa. Gas distilled from the top of continuous multistage<br>
distillation column 413 was condensed in a condenser 414 via a line 74 and<br>
continuously extracted into a storage tank 416 via a line 76. A liquid phase<br>
component was extracted from a line 78 of the continuous multistage distillation<br>
column 413 provided at a location lower than a line 73 and supplied to a continuous<br>
multistage distillation column 418.<br>
The liquid phase component supplied to the continuous multistage distillation<br>
column 418 via the line 78 was separated by distillation in that distillation column.<br>
The liquid temperature at the bottom of the continuous multistage distillation column<br>
418 was 240°C and the pressure at the top of the column was 0.5 kPa. Gas distilled<br>
from the top of the distillation column 418 was condensed in a condenser 419 via a<br>
line 79 and continuously extracted at a rate of about 350 g / hr into a storage tank<br>
409 via a line 80. Liquid extracted from the line 80 was a solution containing about<br>
99% by weight of bisphenol A.<br>
