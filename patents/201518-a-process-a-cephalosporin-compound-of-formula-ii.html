				<td>Field of the invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for preparation of cephalosporin<br>
compound of formula II. The reactive thioester derivatives of the invention are useful as intermediate for the preparation of cephalosporin antibiotics having the formula (II). In addition, the present invention also relates to a process for preparation of cephalosporin antibiotics using the said thioester derivatives.<br><br>
wherein,	Ri represents H, trityl, CH3, CRaRbCOORa<br>
(Ra and Rb independently of one another represents hydrogen or methyl and R3 represents H or C1-C7 alkyl).<br>
R2 represents Ci - C4 alkyl or phenyl<br>
Background Art<br>
Acid chlorides, anhydrides, esters, amide etc. are reported in the chemical literature for activation of carboxylic acid of formula (IV). Activation in the form of acid chloride required protection and deprotection of NH2 group.<br><br>
Activation of acid (IV) is reported by SO2CI2/DMF in US patent 5,856,502 and SOCI2/DMF in US patent 5,037,988. These processes suffer the limitation of using harmful and pungent smelling chemicals like SOCI2, SO2CI2 along with solvents like benzene, toluene, etc. and stringent conditions required for carrying out the reactions at commercial scale.<br>
In US patent No.4,576,749 and 4,548,748 the acid of formula (IV) have also been activated by reacting with 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT) or 2-mercaptobenzothiazole<br><br>
(MBT) in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) to produce reactive ester of the acid (IV) which<br>
then reacted to cephem moiety to prepare cephem antibiotics, but the processes are time consuming and with low yields, hence not suitable.<br>
US patent 4767852 discloses a process for production of cephems by acylating 7-amino-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid with 2-mercaptobenzothiazolyl-(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-methoxyiminoacetate (MAEM). Similarly, US PatNo.5026843 (1991) disclosed a process for preparing ceftriaxone disodium hemiheptahydrate by acylation of ACT by using MAEM as acylating agents in good yield and quality. Thus MAEM has become the standard acylating agent for the preparation of cephalosporins having an oximino group and a 2-aminothiazolyl group in 7-position of cephem compounds.<br>
However, the synthesis of MAEM from acid (III) and 2,2'-dithio-bis-benzothiazole involves use of costly condensing agent triphenylphosphine (TPP). Moreover, during condensation of MAEM with 7-amino-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid compound (III), a toxic compound MBT is also produced as a byproduct, see e.g., Chemical Abstracts, 111, 19243p (1989) which is difficult to remove completely.<br>
Thus it is evident that the procedures described in the prior art for preparation of these antibiotics are complex, involving protection, deprotection and are associated with toxic byproduct generation. Hence there is a need to develop new acylating agents which are capable of transferring the 2-aminothiazolyl moiety to cephem compounds of formula (III) in good yield but without producing this toxic byproduct. On the similar lines, a new thioester was reported by D.G.Walker, Tet. Lett. 1990, 31,6481 to acylate the cephem moiety to get cefepime sulfate but yields obtained by using this thioester were in the range of 54-73% which cannot be considered as good yield to operate a process at commercial scale. The use of this thioester was reported in the Tet. Lett. 1990, 31, 6481 only for cefepime and not for other cephalosporins. This thioester was exploited in US patent No. 5869649 for making three other important cephem antibiotics.<br><br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
The primary objective of the invention is to prepare novel thioester derivatives of thiazolyl acetic acid of the general formula (I), which would be better than the existing reactive derivatives and suitable for being used in the manufacture of cephalosporin antibiotics. Another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the synthesis of thioester derivatives of formula (I) from thiazolyl acetic acid of the general formula (IV) and thio-oxadiazoles of the general formula (VI).<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a simple, high yielding and cost-effective process for the preparation of cephalosporin antibiotics of the general formula (II).<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to produce cephalosporin antibiotics that are highly pure and free from toxic byproducts.<br>
One more objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of cephalosporin antibiotics of the general formula (II) from the said novel thioester derivatives.<br>
Statement of Invention<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides a process for preparing a cephalosporin compound of<br><br>
wherein, Ri represents H, trityl, -CH3, -CRaRbCOORa (Ra and Rb independently of one another represents hydrogen or methyl and R3 represents H or C1-C7 alkyl); R4 is CH3, -CH=CH2, -CH2OCH3, -CH2OCOCH3,<br><br><br>
wherein, R4 and R5 are defined as above and Ra is H or silyl<br>
with a compound of formula I in the presence of an organic solvent, organic base and a silylating agent at a temperature in the range of -10°C to +30^C and optionally purifying the final compound of formula II.<br><br>
wherein, Ri &amp; R2 are as defined above.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides new thioesters of the general formula (I) that are prepared by a novel method which has not been reported in the prior art. The use of these compounds in the process for preparing cephem derivatives renders the process entirely new and different from others. The novel derivative of thiazolyl acetic acid is represented by the formula (I)<br><br><br>
wherein, Ri represents H, trityl, CH3, CRaRbCOORs (Ra and Rb independently of one another represents hydrogen or methyl and R3 represents H or C1-C7 alkyl); R2 represents Ci - C4 alkyl or phenyl The synthesis of compound (I) is achieved by reacting thiazolyl acetic acid of the general<br>
formula (IV) with thio-oxadiazoles of tiae general formula (VI) in organic solvent in<br>
presence of an organic base.  The condensation is done with the help of a condensation<br>
agent of the formula (V).   When the above reaction is carried out, the temperature is<br>
maintained between -10*^ and +30^C.<br><br>
or a standard cephalosporin substituent.<br>
R5 is hydrogen, salt or carboxylic protecting group.<br>
R6 is hydrogen or silyl.<br>
In an embodiment the organic solvent is selected from the group comprising dichloromethane, tetrahydrofiiran, dioxane, N,N-dimethylformamide, acetone, carbon tetrachloride and mixtures thereof. In another embodiment the condensation agent is bis-<br><br>
(2-oxo-oxazolidinyl) phosphinic chloride. In still another embodiment the organic base is selected from triethylamine, diethylamine, tributylamine, pyridine, N-alkylanilines, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.2]undec-7-ene, l,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non"5-ene, N-methylmorpholine and mixtures thereof.<br>
The compound (I) so obtained is reacted with 7-amino cephem carboxylic acids of the general formula (III) in organic solvent in presence of organic base to obtain cephalosporin antibiotics of general formula (II).<br>
For protection of carboxylic group as ester, following group can be used which are easily converted into free carboxylic acid, e.g. p-methoxybenzyl, p-nitrobenzyl, diphenyl methyl, phenacyl trimethylsilyl.<br><br>
wherein, Ri, R2 R4, R5, &amp; Ra are as defined above.<br>
The present invention provides a method by which cephalosporin antibiotics are obtained in high purity (95-99%) and excellent yield (79-95%) without the necessity for protecting the amino group of the acylating agents and the production of toxic byproduct namely 2-mercaptobenzothiazole is avoided.<br>
The substituent R4 in cephem compound (III) represents methyl, acetyloxymethyl, methoxymethyl, vinyl, pyridylmethyl, propenyl, 2,5-dihydro-6-hydroxy-2-methyl-5-oxo-l,2,4-triazine-3-thiol, fiiranyl"2-carbonyl thiol or a standard cephalosporin substituents<br><br>
defined by R4. In general, R4 represents -CH2-X wherein X is a residue of any organic or<br>
inorganic nucleophilic compound, e.g., halogen, hydroxy, cyano, mercapto, azido, amino,<br>
etc.    Furthermore,  X may preferably represent residue  of any 5  or 6 membered<br>
heterocyclic thiol.<br>
The heterocyclic thiol contains one to four hetero atoms selected from a group of nitrogen,<br>
oxygen and/or sulfur. Some of the examples of five membered ring are 1,2,4-thiadiazolyl,<br>

pyrimidyl, pyridinyl-N-oxide, etc.<br>
R5 represents hydrogen, salt or a standard carboxylic protecting group.<br>
Re is hydrogen or silyl.<br>
The condensation of cephem compound (III) with thioester (I) is performed by two different methodologies (a) by acylating the compound (III) (when K^ is H) with compound (I) in aqueous organic solvent; (b) by acylating compound (III) (when Re is silyl) with compound (I) in aprotic organic solvents. Both the approaches are comparable and afforded excellent yields and purities of cephem antibiotics (II).<br>
Acylation of compounds of formula (III) (when R^ is H) is performed in presence of a water miscible solvent like tetrahydrofuran (THF), acetonitrile, acetone, dioxane, N,N-dimethylformamide etc. but the preferable solvents are THF and acetonitrile. In an embodiment of the present invention, acylation of compound of formula (III) (when Re is silyl) is carried out in aprotic organic solvents like halogenated hydrocarbons, toluene, alkyl ethers etc., but the preferred solvent is dichloromethane.

The utility of the novel thioesters of 2-mercapto-5-phenyl-l,3,4-oxadiazole was tried in various coupling reactions of carboxylic acids and amines. Most of amide formation reactions have shown good results. L-alanine, 5-methylisoxazole-4-carboxylic acid, 2-thienylacetic acid, etc. are some of the compounds, which have been activated by above mentioned thiol. Few results are summarized in the following table.<br><br>

Thus the present invention provides novel thioester derivatives of thiazolyl acetic acid of the general formula (I), also, the invention provides a method by which the said thioester derivatives can be prepared by reacting thiazolyl acetic acid of the general formula (IV) with 2-mercapto-5-substituted-l,3,4-oxadiazole of the general formula (VI) (preparation of VI, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1955, 77, 400) in a solvent, in presence of an organic base and with the help of condensation agent bis- (2-oxo-oxazolidinyl) phosphinic chloride of the formula (V) (preparation of V, Synthesis, 1980, 547). The so obtained thioester derivatives are reacted with 7-amino-cephem carboxylic acids of the general formula (III) to produce cephalosporin antibiotic compounds having the general formula (II). The cephalosporin antibiotics so obtained are of high purity (95-99%). The method gives an excellent yield (79-95%) of<br>
cephalosporin without necessitating for the protection of the amino group of the acylating agents, and the toxic byproduct 2-mercaptobenzothiazole is not produced.<br><br>
Many other beneficial results can be obtained by applying disclosed invention in a different manner or by modifying the invention with the scope of disclosure. However, since the major characteristic feature of the present invention resides in the use of novel reactive thioester derivatives of thiazolyl acetic acid of the general formula (I) in preparing the cephalosporin antibiotics, the technical scope of the present invention should not be limited to the following examples.<br>
