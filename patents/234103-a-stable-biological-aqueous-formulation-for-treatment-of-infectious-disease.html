FORMULATIONS FOR PROTECTION OFPEG-INTERFERON ALPHA-<br>
â‚¬ONJUGATES<br>
Throughout this  disclosure,  various  publications,  patents  and patent applications are referenced.    The disclosures of these publications,  patents  and patent  applications   are  herein   incorporated by   reference.<br>
Field of the  Invention<br>
The present invention  pertains  to  formulations  for  the stabilization of PEG-interferon alpha conjugates  during and after lyophilization,  their production  and  use.<br>
Background  of the  Invention<br>
Various  natural   and   recombinant  proteins   have pharmaceutical  utility.     Once they  have been purified,  separated,  and formulated,   they   can  be  parenterally   administered  for  various therapeutic   indications.     However,   parenterally   administered proteins  may  be  immunogenic,  may  be  relatively  water  insoluble, and may have a short pharmacological half life.    Consequently, it can be difficult to achieve therapeutically useful blood levels of the proteins   in  patients.<br>
These problems  can  be overcome by conjugating  the proteins to polymers, such as polyethylene glycol.   Davis et a/., U.S. Pat. No.<br><br>
4,179,337 disclose conjugating polyethylene glycol (PEG) to proteins such as enzymes and insulin to obtain  conjugates  having less immunogenic effect than the original proteins  and  yet  still retaining a substantial proportion of their physiological activity.     Veronese et aL, (Applied Biochem. and Biotech,  11:141-152 ,  1985) disclose     -activating polyethylene  glycols  with  phenyl  chloroformates  to modify a ribonuclease and a superoxide dimutase.    Katre et ai U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,766,106 and 4,917,888 also disclose solubilizing proteins by polymer conjugation.    Likewise, PEG and other polymers can be conjugated  to  recombinant  proteins   to  reduce  immunogenicity  and increase half-life.   See Nitecki, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,902,502, Enzon, Inc.,  International Application No. PCT/US90/02133,  Nishimura et al., European  Patent  Application   154,316  and Tomasi,  International Application  Number PCT/US85/02572.     For example,  interferon alpha-2b is known to be effective for treatment of disease states such as renal cell carcinoma, AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, chronic and acute hepatitis B, chronic and acute non-A, non-B/C hepatitis and hepatitis C.    Improvement of the pharmacological half-life of interferon  alpha-2b  would   improve   treatment   of these  conditions.<br>
While  preparation  of protein-polymer  conjugates  is  beneficial, they cannot be used in a practical manner unless they can be stored for an  extended  period  of time  during  manufacture  and  distribution to health  care  providers.     Some  protein-polymer conjugates, however,  rapidly  deteriorate,  even  in  frozen  solutions". Lyophilization (also known as freeze-drying) is a process that can render a pharmaceutical in a form that can overcome this deficiency.<br><br>
Lyophilization is a process whereby water is sublimed from a composition after it is frozen.    In this process, pharmaceuticals and biologicals that are relatively unstable in an aqueous  solution over a period of time can be placed into dosage containers in an easily processed liquid state,  dried without the use of damaging heat and stored in a dried  state for extended periods.<br>
Due to the low total mass of active substance in each dose, the formulations of most pharmaceuticals  and  biologicals,  including protein-polymer  conjugates,   require   additional   ingredients   to  protect the active ingredient during  the lyophilization process.     For example, a pharmaceutical filled into a dosage container as a low-concentration  aqueous solution can be susceptible to physical loss during the lyophilization  vacuum process or adsorption to the container.    A  lyophilized  formulation often contains bulking ingredients that increase the amount of solid material, as well as cryoprotectants,   lyoprotectants   and  other  stabilizers   to  protect  the active component from  damage.    Which particular formulation will protect a given type of pharmaceutical,  however, must be determined   empirically.<br>
There is a present need for a formulation suitable to protect protein-polymer  conjugates,   and  in  particular  PEG-interferon   alpha conjugates, from damage  during lyophilization.     Such a formulation should   allow  PEG-interferon  alpha-polymer  conjugates   to  maintain their biological  activity,  physical  stability  and  chemical  stability  over extended periods  of time.<br><br>
Summary   of the  Invention<br>
The  present  invention  provides   formulations   that  permit stabilization  of PEG-interferon  alpha conjugates  during  and after lyophilization.<br>
In   one  embodiment,  the present  invention  provides  aqueous, formulations  comprising  PEG-interferon conjugates,  a  buffer,   a stabilizer and  a cryoprotectant.    The present invention also contemplates   processes   for  preparing   stable,   aqueous   formulation solutions  comprising admixing an effective amount of PEG-interferon alpha conjugates with a buffer, a stabilizer, a cryoprotectant and a solvent.    In a preferred aspect of the process of the present invention,   the  formulation   is  prepared   and  maintained   substantially free of dissolved oxygen and a head space of inert atmosphere above the formulation is maintained at a value of less than about 4% oxygen  by  volume.<br>
The present invention is not limited to specific chemicals for the solution components.     However,  in a preferred embodiment, the buffer is sodium phosphate, the stabilizer is a poly(oxy-l,2-ethanediyl)  derivative,  the  cryoprotectant  is  sucrose  and  the  solvent is water.    In such an embodiment, the sodium phosphate can comprise  sodium  phosphate  dibasic   anhydrous  with   sodium phosphate   monobasic   dihydrate.<br>
The present invention is also not limited by the concentrations of the components of the formulations of the present Invention.    In one embodiment,  the concentration  of PEG-interferon  alpha conjugates is preferably 0.03 to 2.0 mg interferon alpha per ml,<br><br>

Alternatively, the ratio of components is 0.08% of said PEG-interferon  alpha conjugates  as measured by  the mass  of the interferon alpha, 3.6% of sodium phosphate, 0.12% of poly(oxy-l,2-ethanediyl) derivative and 96.2% of sucrose, by weight<br>
While the present invention is not limited to a specific PEG-interferon  alpha  conjugate,  in  one embodiment,  the  PEG-interferon alpha conjugates comprise single PEG molecules conjugated to single interferon  molecules.     In  such  an embodiment,  the interferon alpha molecules can be selected from the group consisting of interferon alphaÂ»2a,   interferon   alpha-2b,   interferon   alpha-2c   and   consensus interferon.     In  a preferred  embodiment,  the  interferon  molecules  are interferon  alpha-2b.     Likewise, while the present invention is  not . limited to a specific PEG molecule, in one embodiment, the polyethylene  glycol  is  PEG12000.    In a particularly preferred embodiment,   the  interferon  alpha-2b  molecules  are  linked  to  the<br>
PEG<br>
12000 molecules with a urethane bond.<br><br>
While not limited to a specific characterization,  when single interferon  alpha molecules  are linked  to  single  polymer molecules, the  present  invention  contemplates  that  the  resulting   PEG-interferon alpha conjugates can comprise a mixture of positional isomers.    In a preferred  embodiment, one of the positional isomers  is  an  interferon alpha-2b molecule linked to a PEG,2000 molecule at a histidine residue  on  the  interferon  alpha-2b  molecule.<br>
The present invention  also contemplates  a process  of lyophilization,  comprising  lyophilization  of the  formulations described above to create a lyophilized powder.

Detailed  Description  of the  Invention<br>
"PEG-interferon  alpha  conjugates"   are  interferon   alpha molecules covalently attached to a PEG molecule.    In preferred embodiments,  the  PEG-interferon  alpha  conjugates  of the present invention   comprises  interferon   alpha-2a  (Roferon,  Hoffman  La-Roche,  Nutley,  NJ), interferon alpha 2b (Intron,  Schering-Plough, Madison,  NJ),  interferon alpha-2c  (Berofor Alpha,  Boehringer Ingelheim,  Ingelheim,  Germany) or consensus  interferon  as  defined by  determination  of a consensus  sequence of naturally  occurring interferon alphas  (Infergen,  Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA).<br>
Polymers,  on the other hand,  are molecules having covalently attached  repeating  chemical  units.     Often,  the  approximate  molecular weight of the polymer is designated with a number following the name of the repeated chemical unit.    For example, "PEG120oo" or<br><br>
"polyethylene glycol (12,000)"  refers  to a polymer of polyethylene glycol having  an average  molecular weight of approximately   12,000. In a PEG12000 polymer,  the number of repeated  polyethylene  glycol units in the polymer is approximately 273.    It is understood that these  designations  are  approximate   as  polymers  are   manufactured in the form of a mixture having a distribution of chain lengths, giving an average molecular weight, and it is often impossible to manufacture a polymer  having  a precise and uniform  molecular weight or number of repeated units.     Various other polymers  and their methods for production are well known in  the art.<br>
Methods  for  creating   protein-polymer  conjugates   are also known in the art.    For example, U.S. Patent 5,691,154 to Callstrom et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,686,071 to Subramanian et al U.S. Patent No. 5,639,633 to Callstrom et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,492,821  to Callstrom et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,447,722 to Lang et al and U.S. Patent No. 5,091,176 to Braatz et al all provide   methods   for  producing  protein-polymer  conjugates.<br>
Conjugation of polymers to proteins may result in a single polymer molecule  conjugated to a protein or multiple such conjugations to a single protein.    The degree of conjugation is  dependent  upon  the  reaction  conditions  and desired result.    In a preferred embodiment, the PEG-interferon  alpha conjugate   in  the  formulations  of the  present invention  comprises  a   single   interferon  alpha-2b  conjugated to a single PEGl20oo-     ^n  a particularly preferred embodiment, the interferon alpha-2b molecule is linked to the PEGI2000<br><br>
molecule with a urethane bond.    Reagents  and methods for producing  this  protein-polymer conjugate  can  be  found  in U.S. Patent No. 5,612,460 to Zalipsky and U.S. Patent No. 5,711,944 to Gilbert, et al.    When such a protein-polymer conjugate is utilized in the formulation solutions of the present invention,  the preferred concentration  of PEG-interferon alpha conjugate is 0.03 to 2.0 mg interferon alpha per ml.<br>
When a single interferon alpha molecule is linked to a single polymer molecule,  the resulting  PEG-interferon  alpha conjugates may be in the form of a single positional isomer or in a mixture of positional isomers.    A "mixture of positional  isomers"  indicates that the  individual  PEG-interferon  alpha  conjugates  may be linked at different  sites on different interferon alpha molecules.    For example, in one embodiment  of the  present  invention,  the  PEG-interferon alpha mixture contains at  least one  PEG-interferon  alpha conjugate linked  at a histidine residue of the  interferon alpha  molecule,   while  another PEG-interferon   alpha conjugate is linked at another site of the interferon  alpha molecule (e.g.  the amino terminus).<br>
As  described  above,  preservation  of PEG-interferon alpha conjugates  can be  achieved by  lyophilization. Lyophilization is  a process of freeze-drying a composition wherein  a frozen  aqueous  mixture  is  treated  to remove water.    Commonly, the process involves the sublimation of<br><br>
water from  the  frozen  aqueous  solutions,  usually  under reduced pressure conditions.     After lyophilization,  the PEG-interferon  alpha conjugate can  be  stored  for extended periods of time.<br>
PEG-interferon  alpha conjugates,   however,   are  subject to damage during and after lyophilization.    Damage to PEG-interferon  alpha conjugates can be characterized  by  the loss of protein, loss of biological activity or by the change in the degree  and/or nature of conjugation of the interferon  alpha. For example, a PEG-interferon alpha conjugate may  degrade into free PEG and interferon alpha, resulting in a lowering of the degree of conjugation.    Likewise, the resulting free PEG may  become available  to conjugate to  another interferon alpha,  potentially resulting in  the increase of the degree of conjugation in that target molecule.    Similarly, a PEG-interferon   alpha  conjugate  may   undergo  an  intramolecular shift of the PEG from one site of conjugation to another within the same molecule,  thereby changing the  nature of conjugation  of the  interferon  alpha.<br>
The  present   invention   protects  PEG-interferon   alpha conjugates from  damage  by  including  them in  formulations that prevent damage during  and  after lyophilization.     While the present invention is not limited to a particular formulation,  in  a preferred  embodiment,  the method "utilizes a buffer,  stabilizer,  cryoprotectant and  solvent,  in addition to the  PEG-interferon  alpha conjugate.<br><br>
Buffers are suitable for maintaining the pH of the formulation in a range of 4.5 to 7.1, preferably 6.5-7.1  and most preferably 6.8.    The use of a buffer system of sodium phosphate  dibasic  and  sodium  phosphate  monobasic  is preferred.     When  a sodium phosphate  dibasic anhydrous/monobasic  dihydrate  system  is  utilized,   it  is preferably in equal mass amounts of dibasic to monobasic at a preferred total concentration of 0.005 to 0.1  molar.    Other suitable buffer systems to maintain the desired pH range include   sodium   citrate/citric   acid  and   sodium   acetate/acetic acid.<br>
A stabilizing agent is useful to prevent adsorption of the PEG-interferon alpha conjugate to the stainless steel and glass surfaces of the  equipment used to make  and  store  the formulations  containing the PEG-interferon alpha conjugate.     As one example,  poly(oxy-l,2-ethanediyl) derivatives are  useful as  stabilizing agents.     Mono-9-octadecenoate   poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl)   derivatives   (Polysorbate   80) is a preferred stabilizing agent.    When polysorbate 80 is utilized, the preferred  concentration is  0.01   to   1   mg/ml.<br>
Cryoprotectants,  also  known  as  cryoprotective  agents or  compounds,  are  agents  that protect  chemical  compounds, .   cells, or tissues from the deleterious effects of freezing,  such as that usually accompanying lyophilization.    In the case of PEG-interferon   alpha  conjugates,   cryoprotectants   can  protect them  from  damage,  adsorption and loss  from  vacuum utilized  in  lyophilization.<br><br>
While the present invention is not limited to a specific cryoprotectant,  examples  include,  but  are not limited  to, carbohydrates  such  as the  saccharides,   sucrose,   sugar alcohols such as mannitol, surface active agents such as the Tweens, as well as glycerol and dimethylsulfoxide.    A preferred  cryoprotectant  is  a  carbohydrate.     A  preferred carbohydrate is  a saccharide or disaccharide.     A preferred disaccharide  is   sucrose.<br>
Likewise, the present invention is not limited to any particular amount of cryoprotectant used.    In one embodiment,   cryoprotectants   are  present  in  an   amount sufficient to allow the PEG-interferon alpha conjugate to be lyophilized.     In  such  an  embodiment,  cryoprotectants can  be present in an amount of 0.05% to 90%, preferably 0.05-50%, and most preferably in an amount of about 0.15% to about 10%, based on the total weight of the PEG-interferon alpha solution.     When sucrose is used, the preferred concentration is 20 to  100 mg/ml.<br>
Formulations  including an  effective amount of biologically active  PEG-interferon  alpha  conjugates  are useful  in  treating  disease states, preferably  as injectable aqueous  solutions.     An effective amount  means  the  formulation  or powder has  an  adequate concentration of biologically active component to treat a disease state in an animal.     For example, the preferred  interferon  alpha-2b-<br>
PEG<br>
12000 conjugates are suitable for treatment of disease states such<br>
as renal cell carcinoma, AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, chronic and<br><br>
acute hepatitis B, chronic and acute non-A, non-B/C hepatitis and hepatitis C.    One solution containing an effective amount of this PEG-interferon alpha conjugate contains 0.03 to 2.0 mg/ml of PEG12000-interferon  alpha-2b  conjugate  as  measured  by  protein   mass.<br>
Example<br>
This example provides a description of a formulation of the present invention  and protection  of one PEG-interferon  alpha conjugate  during  lyophilization  and  storage.     The  PEG-interferon alpha conjugate is introduced in  a  lyophilization formulation, lyophilized and stored as a dry powder.    The components of the formulation are as  follows:<br><br>
After lyophilization, the resulting powder is stored and, over a period  of six months,  samples are reconstituted with water for analysis.    The reconstituted solution is analyzed for protein mass<br><br>
content,  degree of conjugation of the PEG-interferon  alpha conjugate, bioactivity and visual clarity.    The results are present in Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
The results show that the total protein mass content is relatively  stable over the nine-month  period.     Additionally,  the change in degree of the monopegylated  interferon alfa-2b (i.e., degradation to free interferon and polymer or creation  of dipegylated  interferon)  negligible.     The  bioactivity  as  measured  by-a cell-based  antiviral  assay remains essentially  unchanged.     The reconstituted  solutions  remain  clear,  colorless  and  free  from  visible particles  throughout  the  six-month  period.     This  demonstrates  a surprisingly  high   stability   during  lyophilization   and   subsequent storage.<br>
From the above, it is clear that the present invention provides formulations   suitable  to  protect   PEG-interferon   alpha  conjugates from  damage  during  lyophilization  and  during   subsequent  storage.<br><br><br>
