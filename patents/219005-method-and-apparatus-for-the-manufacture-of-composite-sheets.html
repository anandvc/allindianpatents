				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a direct<br>
method, and an apparatus for carrying out the said<br>
method, for the manufacture of composite sheets. It<br>
also relates to the composite products obtained.<br>
Composite sheets are usually formed from at<br>
least two materials which have different melting points<br>
and which generally comprise an organic material and a<br>
reinforcing material, the reinforcing material being,<br>
for example, in the form of threads embedded in the<br>
organic matrix. The manufacture of composite sheets<br>
generally takes a long time between the preparation of<br>
the reinforcing threads and the moment when the sheets<br>
are finally obtained, the structures used for producing<br>
the sheets usually not being the threads, as such, but<br>
complex structures incorporating the threads and<br>
requiring prior processing steps.<br>
In particular, it is already known to<br>
manufacture composite sheets in the form of panels or<br>
of curved pieces from fabrics formed both from<br>
reinforcing threads and from thermoplastic threads, in<br>
that the fabrics are stacked and the stack thus<br>
produced is then hot-pressed, as described in the<br>
utility model FR 2,500,360. Such a method has, in<br>
particular, the disadvantage of being a discontinuous<br>
method.<br>
It is also known (patent FR 2,743,822) to<br>
manufacture composite sheets from glass/organic<br>
material fabrics which are deposited continuously onto<br>
a conveyor and are then preheated in a hot-air oven,<br>
before being introduced into a "band press" (of the<br>
type described in the patent US-A-4,277,539), where<br>
they are successfully heated and cooled, whilst at the<br>
same time being compressed. Although this method is<br>
quicker than the method described above, it is<br>
desirable to improve the manufacture of composite<br>
sheets even further by providing quicker and more<br>
economical methods, whilst at the same time ensuring<br>
that products preserving good properties, in particular<br>
mechanical properties, are obtained.<br>
The object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a method which is improved, as compared with<br>
existing methods, for the manufacture of composite<br>
sheets, in particular a quicker and more economical<br>
method than the existing methods.<br>
This object is achieved by means of the method<br>
according to the invention, comprising at least the<br>
following steps:<br>
• a bundle of parallel threads is driven in a given<br>
direction,<br>
• a lap of thread or threads oriented transversely<br>
relative to this given direction is combined with<br>
this bundle, the bundle of threads and/or the lap of<br>
thread or threads comprising at least one organic<br>
material and at least one reinforcing material,<br>
• the combination is heated, being displaced in the<br>
given direction, and is fixed (or set) by the action<br>
of heat and/or of pressure, then by cooling, so as to<br>
form a composite band,<br>
• the band is collected in the form of one or more<br>
composite sheets.<br>
The various steps, such as the driving of the<br>
bundle, the combining of the lap, etc., advantageously<br>
take place continuously, this term also embracing<br>
intermittent drive and combination, as in the case of<br>
combination with a carriage (this embodiment being<br>
explained later).<br>
By "sheet" (and likewise by "band") is meant,<br>
according to the present invention, an element of small<br>
thickness in relation to its surface, generally plane<br>
(but, where appropriate, possibly being curved) and<br>
rigid, although having, as required, sufficient<br>
flexibility to be capable of being collected and stored<br>
in wound-up form. In general, it is a solid element,<br>
but, in some cases, it may be perforated (the term<br>
"sheet" and the term "band" thus also, by extension,<br>
designate structures of the netting or fabric type,<br>
according to the invention).<br>
By "composite" is meant, according to the<br>
present invention, the combination of at least two<br>
materials of different melting points, including in<br>
general an organic material and a reinforcing material,<br>
the content of the lower melting point material (the<br>
organic material) being at least 10% by weight of the<br>
said combination.<br>
The method according to the invention makes it<br>
possible to obtain composite sheets in a single<br>
operation from simple starting structures; in fact, the<br>
method according to the invention essentially employs<br>
unidirectional structures or threads; in particular,<br>
the reinforcing material used in the method according<br>
to the invention is provided solely in the form of<br>
threads, separate from one another and unconnected<br>
within "complex" structures (in particular, "multi-<br>
dimensional" structures of the fabric or netting type).<br>
The use of the simplest reinforcing structures in the<br>
manufacture of the sheets according to the invention<br>
has advantages particularly in terms of cost and of<br>
ease of use. From these simple structures, the method<br>
according to the invention makes it possible to obtain<br>
the desired sheets directly, with little labour being<br>
required and with the transfers from one installation<br>
to another and the intermediate storages being<br>
dispensed with. It combines, in particular, a step of<br>
assembly in a plane transverse to the given direction<br>
and a step of melting and solidifying the organic<br>
material in order to culminate in the finished product.<br>
Such a method is particularly quick and economical.<br>
Reference will simply be made, hereafter, to<br>
the "bundle of threads" in order to designate the<br>
bundle of parallel threads which is driven continuously<br>
in a given direction, the said bundle being mentioned<br>
in the definition of the invention, and "the lap of<br>
thread or threads" will designate the lap of<br>
transversely oriented thread or threads, the said lap<br>
being mentioned in the definition of the invention,<br>
that is to say, more specifically, one or more threads<br>
distributed transversely on the surface defined by the<br>
bundle of parallel threads.<br>
According to the invention, at least the bundle<br>
of threads or at least the lap of threads is formed<br>
from threads of at least two materials which comprise<br>
at least one organic material and at least one<br>
reinforcing material, this "reinforcing material"<br>
generally being a material selected from the materials<br>
commonly used for the reinforcement of organic<br>
materials (such as glass, carbon, aramid, etc.) or<br>
being capable, where appropriate, of being understood<br>
in a broad sense as a material having a melting point<br>
higher than that of the abovementioned organic<br>
material; in other words, at least the bundle of<br>
threads or at least the lap of threads is formed from<br>
threads of at least two materials having different<br>
melting points, the material with the lower melting<br>
point being an organic material. The organic material<br>
is, for example, polypropylene, polyethylene,<br>
polybutylene terephthalate, polyethylene terephthalate,<br>
phenylene polysulphide or any other thermoplastic or<br>
polymeric organic material selected from thermoplastic<br>
polyesters, polyamides, etc., the reinforcing material<br>
or the material with the higher melting point<br>
preferably being glass.<br>
Preferably, the bundle and the lap are selected<br>
in such a way that the combination of the bundle and of<br>
the lap comprises at least 10% by weight of organic<br>
material and between 20 and 90% by weight of<br>
reinforcing material (preferably glass), preferably<br>
between 30 and 85% by weight of reinforcing material,<br>
and, in a particularly preferred way, between 40 and<br>
80% by weight of reinforcing material. Particularly<br>
advantageously, the combination of the bundle and of<br>
the lap consists of the reinforcing material, in the<br>
proportions mentioned, and of the organic material in a<br>
proportion representing the complement to 100% by<br>
weight of the said combination. The bundle and/or the<br>
lap may comprise partially threads consisting of one of<br>
the materials and partially threads consisting of the<br>
other material, these threads being arranged<br>
alternately in the bundle and/or the lap and being<br>
preferably intimately mixed. The bundle and/or the lap<br>
may also comprise mixed threads obtained by the joining<br>
and simultaneous winding of the threads of one of the<br>
materials and of the threads of the other material,<br>
these mixed threads likewise being capable of being<br>
blended with threads of one of the materials and/or<br>
with threads of the other material.<br>
Preferably, the combination of the bundle and<br>
of the lap and/or the bundle and/or the lap comprises<br>
at least 50% (advantageously at least 80% and, in a<br>
particularly preferred way, 100%) by weight of co-<br>
blended threads, that is to say of threads composed of<br>
filaments of one of the materials and the filaments of<br>
the other material, the filaments being blended within<br>
the threads (advantageously in an approximately<br>
homogeneous way), these threads generally being<br>
obtained by assembling the filaments directly at the<br>
time of the manufacture of the said filaments<br>
(according to the methods described, for example, in<br>
the patents EP 0,599,695 and EP 0,616,055). The use of<br>
these structures having at least 50% and preferably at<br>
least 80% by weight of co-blended threads makes it<br>
possible, in particular, to obtain more homogeneous<br>
composite products having good mechanical properties,<br>
the production of the composite sheets taking place,<br>
furthermore, within a reduced time and advantageously<br>
at lower pressure. Preferably, these co-blended threads<br>
consist of glass filaments and of filaments of<br>
thermoplastic organic material, the said filaments<br>
being intimately mixed.<br>
Preferably, the bundle of threads consists<br>
essentially of co-blended threads and the lap of<br>
threads consists of continuous (generally parallel) or<br>
cut co-blended threads and/or of continuous (generally<br>
parallel) or cut reinforcing threads and/or of<br>
continuous (generally parallel) or cut threads of<br>
organic material.<br>
In the method according to the invention, the<br>
threads of the bundle and the threads of the lap most<br>
often emanate from one or more supports (or packages)<br>
on which they are wound, the threads of the lap being<br>
cut, as required, before being combined with the<br>
threads of the bundle.<br>
The bundle and the lap can be combined in<br>
various ways, for example by means of one or more<br>
depositing arms or by means of a carriage carrying the<br>
threads of the lap which are arranged in parallel or by<br>
depositing the threads pneumatically (if appropriate,<br>
with the formation of loops or of a mat) or by<br>
depositing the cut threads, etc.<br>
According to a first embodiment, combination<br>
takes place by the lap of threads (in this case, they<br>
are preferably continuous threads) being incorporated<br>
transversely into the bundle of parallel threads, the<br>
bundle being, in this particular case, separated into<br>
two parts (one part being vertically in line with the<br>
other, for example one thread out of two being<br>
temporarily raised relative to the initial plane of the<br>
bundle and, if appropriate, the other threads being<br>
temporarily lowered relative to the initial plane)<br>
delimiting a space, within which the threads are<br>
projected with the aid of a rapier loom. This loom<br>
comprises, for example, two rapiers equipped with<br>
grippers, one rapier introducing, for example, the<br>
threads of the lap into the middle of the bundle and<br>
the second rapier extracting the threads from the other<br>
side of the bundle, the threads then being cut. The<br>
loom may also comprise a single rapier.<br>
According to a second embodiment, a carriage<br>
carrying the lap of threads in the form of parallel<br>
continuous threads delivers the lap into the bundle of<br>
parallel threads, the lap and the bundle subsequently<br>
being, if appropriate, sewn to one another by means of<br>
binding threads delivered continuously (for example,<br>
fine threads of polyester or of polypropylene or of<br>
glass) . These binding threads are put to use, for<br>
example, by means of the periodic movement of a<br>
transverse needle bar. Contrary to the previous<br>
embodiment, the threads of the lap and of the bundle<br>
are not intermingled, but are simply bound to one<br>
another. The products obtained in this case have good<br>
alignment (and therefore little shrinkage) and a high<br>
degree of deformability.<br>
According to a third embodiment, combination<br>
takes place by the lap of threads (in this case, these<br>
are likewise preferably continuous threads) being<br>
incorporated transversely into the bundle of parallel<br>
threads with the aid of a netting loom with weft<br>
insertion by a rotary arm or rotary arms. This loom may<br>
comprise one or more rotary arms, the threads of the<br>
lap coming either from a bobbin or bobbins arranged on<br>
the wheel carrying the depositing arms, this wheel<br>
being driven in rotation, or from a bobbin or bobbins<br>
arranged on another support in movement (synchronous<br>
with the movement of the depositing arms) or from a<br>
stationary bobbin or stationary bobbins, in this case<br>
the arm or arms being generally hollow arms with an<br>
axial passage. The products obtained in this embodiment<br>
have very little shrinkage and very good mechanical<br>
properties.<br>
According to a fourth embodiment, combination<br>
takes place by the threads being cut above the bundle<br>
of parallel threads, the cut threads being oriented in<br>
various directions, particularly in directions<br>
transverse to that of the bundle of threads, the cut<br>
threads forming a lap which is superposed on the bundle<br>
of threads. Preferably, in this embodiment, the threads<br>
fall onto one or more deflectors (as a rule, a metal<br>
plate, or, if appropriate, a plurality of metal plates,<br>
inclined at an angle of the order of 45 to 80° relative<br>
to the bundle of threads), making it possible to orient<br>
them more accurately in directions transverse relative<br>
to the given direction, before they are distributed on<br>
the bundle of parallel threads.<br>
According to a fifth embodiment, combination<br>
takes place by one or more threads being projected<br>
transversely in the form of a mat onto the bundle of<br>
parallel threads, the lap of threads in the form of the<br>
mat being, if appropriate, covered by a second bundle<br>
of parallel threads which is displaced in the same<br>
direction as the first bundle of parallel threads.<br>
The combination of the bundle and lap of<br>
threads (displaced at a speed of, for example, between<br>
0.5 and 10 m/min) passes into at least one zone, where<br>
it is heated to a temperature between the melting<br>
points of the materials forming the combination, this<br>
temperature also being below the degradation<br>
temperature of the material having the lowest melting<br>
point. In the present invention, the "degradation<br>
temperature" designates, by extension, the minimum<br>
temperature at which decomposition of the molecules<br>
making up the material is observed (as traditionally<br>
defined and understood by the average person skilled in<br>
the art) or an undesirable change in the material, such<br>
as an inflammation of the material, a loss of<br>
intactness of the material (resulting in the material<br>
flowing out of the lap) or an undesirable colouring of<br>
the material (for example, yellowing), is observed.<br>
This degradation temperature can be evaluated in the<br>
traditional way by thermogravimetry and/or by noting<br>
the minimum temperature at which one of the<br>
abovementioned effects occurs.<br>
In the present invention, the combination is<br>
heated sufficiently to make it possible for at least<br>
some of the threads to be bound to one another by means<br>
of the material with the lowest melting point, after<br>
heating and/or compression, and, in most cases (except<br>
when a structure of a netting type is desired instead),<br>
to make it possible to obtain a solid or approximately<br>
solid structure.<br>
As examples, the heating temperature may be of<br>
the order of 190 to 230°C when the lap of threads<br>
consists of glass and of polypropylene, it may be of<br>
the order of 280 to 310°C when the lap consists of<br>
glass and of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) , and it<br>
may be of the order of 270 to 280-290°C when the lap<br>
consists of glass and of polybutylene terephthalate<br>
(PBT).<br>
The combination may be heated in several ways,<br>
for example with the aid of a double-band laminating<br>
machine, or with the aid of heated cylinders or of an<br>
irradiation device, such as an infrared radiation<br>
device (for example, in the form of an infrared oven or<br>
lamp or lamps or panel or panels), and/or at least one<br>
hot-air blowing device (for example, a forced-<br>
convection hot-air oven).<br>
Heating may be sufficient to make it possible<br>
to fix the combination by means of the melted organic<br>
material (thermofixing). In many cases, however, the<br>
heated combination also undergoes compression with the<br>
aid of a compression device, for example with the aid<br>
of at least one two-roll calender. The force exerted on<br>
the combination during its passage through the<br>
compression device, for example during its simultaneous<br>
passage between two rolls of a calender, is generally<br>
several kgf/cm, even several tens of kgf/cm. The<br>
pressure exerted in the compression device compacts the<br>
lap of threads, the structure obtained being set by<br>
cooling, this cooling being capable of being carried<br>
out, at least partially, simultaneously with the<br>
compression or also being capable of being carried out<br>
after a hot-compression step.<br>
The compression device may comprise at least<br>
one calender, in particular a calender maintained at a<br>
temperature below the solidification point of the<br>
material with the lowest melting point (the calender<br>
is, for example, at a temperature of between 20 and<br>
150°C), in order to solidify the said material.<br>
The compression device may also comprise a<br>
plurality of calenders, particularly where large<br>
thicknesses are concerned and if it is desirable to<br>
have very good planeness and/or high production speeds.<br>
Moreover, particularly when use is made of materials<br>
with high melting points or having a high<br>
crystallization rate (for example, polyesters), and<br>
when the aim is to obtain solid or approximately solid<br>
sheets, it may be desirable to heat the calender (or at<br>
least the first calender) of the compression device to<br>
a temperature higher than 75°C, preferably higher than<br>
100°C, even higher than 150°C. In this case, the rolls<br>
of the heated calender are preferably covered with an<br>
anti-adhesive covering based, for example, on PTFE<br>
and/or a mould release film (made of silicone-coated<br>
paper or of glass cloth coated, for example, with PTFE)<br>
is unwound between each roll and the lap of threads<br>
(this film may, if appropriate, be in the form of an<br>
endless band).<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention,<br>
the compression device may also comprise or consist of<br>
a band press (equipped, for example, with bands of<br>
steel or of glass cloth or of aramid cloth, the cloth<br>
preferably being coated with PTFE) comprising a hot<br>
zone (in particular, with one or more calenders)<br>
followed by a cold zone (with cooling elements in the<br>
form of bars, plates, etc. and, if appropriate, one or<br>
more calenders).<br>
Cooling may take place in the compression<br>
device (for example, in a cold calender or in the cold<br>
zone of a double-band flat laminating machine) or may<br>
take place outside the compression device, for example<br>
by natural or forced convection. In order to accelerate<br>
its cooling, the composite band obtained at the exit of<br>
the abovementioned compression device can pass onto a<br>
cooling table, in which cold water circulates, this<br>
table, if appropriate, being slightly curved convexly,<br>
in order to improve contact with the band. In order to<br>
improve cooling and/or contact even further, the table<br>
may be combined with press rollers, preferably cooled<br>
(for example, by water circulation), and/or with one or<br>
more freely bearing or pressed cooled plates and/or<br>
with one or more air-blowing nozzles, and/or the band<br>
may be drawn by take-up rollers located, for example,<br>
at the exit of the table.<br>
The composite band, after being compressed and<br>
cooled, can be wound onto a mandrel, the diameter of<br>
which is a function of the thickness of the band (the<br>
sheet formed then corresponds to the wound band), or<br>
can be cut by a cutting device (for example, a<br>
guillotine or circular-saw device) , so as to form a<br>
plurality of sheets.<br>
Although the present method is essentially<br>
described in terms of the combination of one lap of<br>
threads and of one bundle of parallel threads, it is<br>
quite clear that a plurality of laps may be combined<br>
with one or more bundles of threads in the same way as<br>
described above. It is possible, in particular, to<br>
combine a plurality of laps of threads in order to form<br>
sheets of greater thickness. Thus, according to one<br>
embodiment of the invention:<br>
• a first bundle of parallel threads is driven in a<br>
given direction,<br>
• a lap of threads oriented transversely relative to<br>
this given direction is combined with this first<br>
bundle,<br>
• at least one second bundle of parallel threads is<br>
combined with the bundle and with the lap in the<br>
given direction, the first bundle of threads and/or<br>
the lap of threads and/or the second bundle of<br>
threads comprising at least two materials having<br>
different melting points,<br>
• the combination is heated, being displaced in the<br>
given direction, and is fixed by the action of heat<br>
and/or of pressure, then by cooling, so as to form a<br>
composite band,<br>
• the band is collected in the form of one or more<br>
composite sheets.<br>
It is also possible, before compression of the<br>
assembly, to unwind one or more surface films onto one<br>
or two faces of the combination, these films adhering<br>
under hot conditions to the combination of the<br>
bundle(s) and lap(s). These films may be of a material<br>
or materials identical to or different from those (or<br>
one of those) of the threads of the combination (they<br>
may be metallic, organic, etc.), these films preferably<br>
being of a nature or having a covering of a nature<br>
close to the nature of the material of lowest melting<br>
point present in the combination.<br>
In more general terms, it is possible to apply<br>
to the surface of the combination and/or introduce into<br>
the combination other structures in the form of threads<br>
or an assembly of threads, cellular structures, or<br>
structures containing elements in the form of powder,<br>
of granules or of liquid, leaves or panels or films, of<br>
an essentially metallic or polymeric or mineral or<br>
vegetable nature, which are continuous or<br>
discontinuous, and imparting particular properties to<br>
the composite sheets obtained (additional reinforcement<br>
by means of threads of different nature, improvement in<br>
the mechanical properties, protection against<br>
electromagnetic radiation, improvement in thermal or<br>
acoustic insulation, lightened composite structures,<br>
improved moulding capacity, surface appearance, etc.).<br>
The band obtained in the method according to<br>
the invention may be collected in the form of packages<br>
(that is to say, as it were, in the form of a single<br>
wound composite sheet) or of a plurality of sheets cut<br>
to the dimensions required by the users.<br>
The present invention also relates to an<br>
apparatus for carrying out the method. This apparatus<br>
comprises:<br>
a) one or more devices (or members) for feeding at<br>
least one bundle of parallel threads,<br>
b) one or more devices (or members) for feeding at<br>
least one lap of threads,<br>
c) one or more devices for orienting the threads of<br>
the lap transversely to the direction of the<br>
parallel threads of the bundle (for example,<br>
according to the embodiment, a rapier loom, a<br>
carriage loom, a netting loom with weft insertion<br>
by rotary arms, or a deflector, as described in<br>
the various embodiments explained above),<br>
d) at least one device (or member) for heating the<br>
combination of the bundle and of the lap,<br>
e) and at least one device for cooling the combination.<br>
The apparatus according to the invention may<br>
also comprise at least one compression device and/or at<br>
least one cutting device and/or at least one device for<br>
collecting the composite sheets. The cooling device may<br>
also be a compression device, or the apparatus<br>
according to the invention may comprise at least one<br>
device for compressing the combination of the bundle<br>
and of the lap separate from the cooling device.<br>
The composite sheets obtained as a result of<br>
the combination of steps of the method according to the<br>
invention are particularly economical and comprise<br>
filaments of a material having a higher melting point<br>
(generally reinforcing filaments) which are embedded in<br>
the sheet and are arranged, generally with regard to at<br>
least part of them, in the direction of travel of the<br>
sheet during its manufacture and, preferably likewise<br>
with regard to the other part (or at least another part<br>
of these filaments) in a direction transverse to the<br>
direction of travel. The sheet thus comprises at least<br>
one assembly of filaments of a material having a higher<br>
melting point, which are arranged approximately<br>
parallel in a first direction, and, if appropriate, at<br>
least one second assembly of filaments of a material<br>
having a higher melting point, which are arranged<br>
approximately parallel in a second direction preferably<br>
transverse to the first, all these filaments being<br>
embedded in the material having a lower melting point.<br>
The sheets obtained generally have a thickness of<br>
between a few tenths of a millimetre and approximately<br>
2 mm, are rigid and easy to cut and have good<br>
mechanical properties. They may be used as such in<br>
moulding methods or in combination with other products.<br>
They may be used, for example, for the thermoforming<br>
and the moulding of pieces made of composite products.<br>
As a general rule, the sheets obtained have<br>
little shrinkage (the ratio between the length of the<br>
thread in one direction and the length of the sheet in<br>
this direction, this ratio being evaluated with regard<br>
to threads passing through the sheet in this direction<br>
and not with regard to cut threads) in each of the<br>
preferred directions of orientation of the threads, the<br>
shrinkage generally being below 6%, or even 2% or 1%,<br>
in at least one direction. With regard to sheets<br>
obtained, using a netting loom with weft insertion by<br>
rotary arms, even the complete or virtually complete<br>
absence of shrinkage can be seen.<br>
Other advantages and characteristics of the<br>
invention may be gathered from the following accompanying drawings<br>
which illustrate the invention, but without limiting<br>
it, and in which:<br>

apparatus for implementing the invention.<br>
In the method illustrated in Figure 1, a<br>
double-rapier weaving loom 1 is fed with a bundle of<br>
threads 2 (having, for example, 4 threads per cm) which<br>
come from rovings 3, the threads passing through a comb<br>
and arriving in parallel in the weaving loom (a part<br>
which is not visible and is not shown in the figure) ,<br>
these threads being, for example, composite threads<br>
composed of glass filaments and of polypropylene<br>
filaments blended with one another.<br>
A fabric 4 is manufactured by the insertion,<br>
for example at 120 strokes/mn, of a thread 5 (coming<br>
from a roving 6 and likewise composed of glass<br>
filaments and of polypropylene filaments) per cm, in<br>
the form of a cloth-like assembly.<br>
The fabric passes under a first cylinder 7<br>
heated, for example, to 200°C and having, for example,<br>
a diameter of the order of 300 mm, and then passes over<br>
a second heated cylinder 8. The polypropylene filaments<br>
melt in contact with the hot surfaces. The product then<br>
passes into the nip of a calender 9, thermostatically<br>
controlled at, for example, 40°C, where it is cooled<br>
and converted into a sheet 10, for example with a<br>
thickness of about 0.7 mm, composed, for example, of<br>
40% by weight of polypropylene and of 60% by weight of<br>
glass filaments oriented in two perpendicular<br>
directions. It is subsequently, for example, wound onto<br>
a tube 11 having a diameter of 100 mm.<br>
In Figure 2, a bundle 20 of parallel composite<br>
threads composed, for example, of glass filaments and<br>
of polypropylene filaments is unwound from one or more<br>
beams 21 and is introduced into a knitting machine 22<br>
equipped with a weft insertion carriage 23 capable of<br>
taking up a plurality of threads 24 simultaneously<br>
(these threads having come from rovings 25 and likewise<br>
being composite threads) and of depositing them<br>
transversely to the direction of displacement of the<br>
bundle of threads, for example at the rate of 2 threads<br>
per cm.<br>
These threads 24 may be bound to the threads of<br>
the bundle by means of a simultaneous knitting<br>
operation, the binding threads being products having a<br>
linear density, or mass per unit length, of less than<br>
50 tex (g/km). The sewn product subsequently passes<br>
into a consolidation device similar to that of Figure<br>
1.<br>
In an economical variant which does not employ-<br>
binding threads, a second bundle of threads is brought<br>
onto the lap of threads deposited by means of a<br>
carriage, in order to block them. The non-sewn assembly<br>
is subsequently conveyed directly onto the<br>
consolidation and winding system.<br>
In another more elaborate variant, use is made<br>
of a plurality of weft insertion carriages which are<br>
movable in the plane along two axes and which make it<br>
possible to produce multi-layer surfaces having a<br>
plurality of directions, for example 0o/-45°/+45o/90°.<br>
These thicker products may or may not be bound by<br>
knitting and may be directly consolidated in line by<br>
melting and cooling under pressure or simply<br>
thermofixed by melting/cooling, without pressure being<br>
applied.<br>
Figure 3 describes a method for the manufacture<br>
of a plane product in the form of a consolidated glass/<br>
thermoplastic composite product, in which use is made<br>
of two bundles of composite parallel threads 30 and 31<br>
and a lap of composite threads 32 which come from<br>
rovings 33 deposited transversely in the form of a mat<br>
having continuous threads.<br>
The bundles of parallel threads may come from<br>
creels, not shown in Figure 3, or be wound on beams 34<br>
and 35, these threads passing through combs 36, 37<br>
keeping them parallel, then through take-up cylinders<br>
38, 39 making it possible to reduce the tensions of the<br>
threads, before these enter the consolidation device.<br>
A plurality of threads 32 are deposited between<br>
these bundles by means of a carriage 40 which is<br>
displaced transversely to the direction of displacement<br>
of the bundles in an alternating movement, in order to<br>
form a mat (or a lap of looped threads) . This carriage<br>
is, for example, equipped with a cylinder-type take-up<br>
system coupled to a compressed-air ejector having a<br>
Venturi effect.<br>
The combination of the bundles and of the lap<br>
subsequently passes between the continuous bands 41<br>
(made of glass fabrics impregnated with polytetra-<br>
fluoroethylene - PTFE -) of a flat laminating press 42.<br>
This laminating press comprises a heating zone 43 and a<br>
zone 44 cooled by water circulation and, between these<br>
two zones, pressing cylinders 45 which compress the<br>
melteed thermoplastic material under a pressure in the<br>
vicinity of, for example, 10 to 20 N/cm2.<br>
At the exit of this double-band press, the<br>
product has a homogeneous appearance, this appearance<br>
being capable of being improved, for example, by two<br>
polypropylene films 46 and 47 deposited on either side<br>
of the combination between the bands of the press. The<br>
rigid sheet obtained is subsequently either wound onto<br>
a tube 48 having a diameter of, for example, 100 mm or<br>
is cut continuously into a plurality of rectangles by<br>
means of blades and an automatic shearing machine which<br>
are not shown.<br>
In one variant, the double-band press is<br>
replaced by a device comprising two heated rollers<br>
covered with PTFE, followed by a calender having two<br>
cooled cylinders. The two polypropylene surface films<br>
46 and 47 are, in this case, preferably introduced into<br>
the nip of the cold calender.<br>
The method shown in Figure 4 closely resembles<br>
that shown in Figure 3 (the same references being<br>
adopted again for the same elements). The difference is<br>
in the type of mat which is sandwiched between the two<br>
warps of parallel threads. Here, this mat is, for<br>
example, formed by threads 50 of pure glass which are<br>
cut to a length of 50 or 100 mm and are oriented in the<br>
transverse direction by means of a deflecting plate 51.<br>
Two polypropylene films 52 and 53 having a thickness<br>
of, for example, 50 µm may, if appropriate, be<br>
introduced on either side of this mat. Two other<br>
polypropylene films, not shown, may also be added on<br>
each side of the product, in order to improve its<br>
surface appearance. The product obtained may be wound<br>
or cut into sheets.<br>
The cut-thread mat may also consist of the<br>
thread of the same nature as that of the threads of the<br>
bundle (for example: 60% glass and 40% polypropylene).<br>
In this case, there is no need to introduce films 52<br>
and 53 into the core of the product.<br>
• That part of the apparatus which is shown in<br>
Figure 5 is a variant of the "consolidation" part of<br>
the methods shown in Figures 1 and 2. It follows, for<br>
example, a weaving or knitting loom with weft insertion<br>
60. The organic part is melted contactlessly by means<br>
of two infrared radiation panels 61 which are<br>
retractable in order to avoid the risks of the<br>
combination being damaged (or burnt) during stoppages<br>
of the loom. After the partially melted product has<br>
been deflected on a thermostatically controlled bar 62,<br>
the said product is compacted and cooled in the nip of<br>
a calender 63, for example at 40°C, and then passes, if<br>
appropriate, over a convexly-curved cooling table 64.<br>
The product, driven by rollers 65, 66, is subsequently<br>
cut into sheets 67 with the aid of one or more cutting<br>
devices 68.<br>
Where a shutdown of the weaving (or knitting)<br>
loom is concerned, an accumulator 69 draws to the rear<br>
that part of the product which is located between the<br>
end of the infrared panels and the entrance of the<br>
calender, so as not to have zones of non-compacting<br>
product corresponding to each stoppage. Moreover, in<br>
order to avoid the product being damaged on the<br>
deflecting bar, thermostatically controlled at, for<br>
example, 220°C, a move-away bar 7 0 moves the product<br>
away.<br>
The method in Figure 6 is a variant of the<br>
method described in Figure 5 and leads to products<br>
which are simply thermofixed, without consolidation.<br>
The previous system of compacting/cooling by calender<br>
and convexly-curved cooling table is replaced, here, by<br>
air-blowing boxes 71.<br>
The sheets produced according to the present<br>
invention are particularly suitable for the production<br>
of composite articles by moulding.<br>
