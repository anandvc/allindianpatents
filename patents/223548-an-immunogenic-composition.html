The present invention relates to novel adjuvant compositions for use in vaccines. In particular, the adjuvant compositions of the present invention comprise a combination of saponin and an immunostimulatory oligonucleotide, said combination optionally further comprising a carrier. Also provided by the present invention are vaccines comprising the adjuvant compositions of the present invention and at least one antigen. Further provided are methods of manufacture of the adjuvant compositions and vaccines of tne present invention and their use as medicaments. Additionally, the present invention provides methods of treating an individual susceptible to or suffering from a disease by the parenteral or mucosal administration of the vaccines of the present invention.<br>
Immunostimulatory oligonucleotides containing unmethylated CpG dinucleotides ("CpG") and are known in the art as being adjuvants when administered by both systemic and mucosal routes (WO 96/02555, EP 468520, Davis et al, JJmmunol, 1998,160(2):870-876;McCluskie and Davis, JJmmunol., 1998,161(9):4463-6). CpG is an abbreviation for cytosine-guanosine dinucleotide motifs present in DNA. Historically, it was observed that the DNA fraction of BCG could exert an anti-tumour effect. In further studies, synthetic oligonucleotides derived from BCG gene sequences were shown to be capable of inducing immunostimulatory effects (both in vitro and in vivo). The authors of these studies concluded that certain palindromic sequences, including a central CG motif, carried this activity. The central role of the CG motif in immunostimulation was later elucidated in a publication by Krieg, Nature 374, p546 1995. Detailed analysis has shown that the CG motif has to be in a certain sequence context, and that such sequences are common in bacterial DNA but are rare in vertebrate DNA. The immunostimulatory sequence is often: Purine, Purine, C, G, pyrimidine, pyrimidine; wherein the dinucleotide CG motif is not methylated, but other unmethylated CpG sequences are known to be immunostimulatory and may be used in the present invention.<br>

'"},     '   '      ■'     ■■■-•'   \        ■'  '■	*   ■       )      '.**<br><br>
In certain combinations of the six nucleotides a palindromic sequence is present. Several of these motifs, either as repeats of one motif or a combination of different motifs, can be present in the same oligonucleotide. The presence of one or more of these irnmunostimulatory sequence containing oligonucleotides can activate various immune subsets, including natural killer cells (which produce interferon y and have cytolytic activity) and macrophages (Wooldrige et al Vol 89 (no. 8), 1977). Although other unmethylated CpG containing sequences not having this consensus sequence have now been shown to be immunomodulatory.<br>
CpG when formulated into vaccines, is generally administered in free solution together with free antigen (WO 96/02555; McCluskie and Davis, supra) or covalently conjugated to an antigen (PCT Publication No. WO 98/16247), or formulated with a carrier such as aluminium hydroxide ((Hepatitis surface antigen) Davis et al. supra ; Brazolot-Mfflan etal, Proc.NatlAcad.ScL, USA, 1998, 95(26), 15553-8).<br>
Saponins are taught in: Lacaille-Dubois, M and Wagner H. (1996. A review of the biological and pharmacological activities of saponins. Phytomedicine vol 2 pp 363-386). Saponins are steroid or triterpene glycosides widely distributed in the plant and marine animal kingdoms. Saponins are noted for forming colloidal solutions in water which foam on shaking, and for precipitating cholesterol. When saponins are near cell membranes they create pore-like structures in the membrane which cause the membrane to burst. Haemolysis of erythrocytes is an example of this phenomenon, which is a property of certain, but not all, saponins.<br>
Saponins are known as adjuvants in vaccines for systemic administration. The adjuvant and haemolytic activity of individual saponins has been extensively studied in the art (Lacaille-Dubois and Wagner, supra). For example, Quil A (derived from the bark of the South American tree Quillaja Saponaria Molina), and fractions thereof, are described in US 5,057,540 and "Saponins as vaccine adjuvants", Kensil, C. R., Crit Rev Ther Drug Carrier Syst, 1996,12 (l-2):l-55; and EP 0 362 279 Bl.<br><br>
Particulate structures, termed Immune Stimulating Complexes (ISCOMS), comprising fractions of Quil A are haemolytic and have been used in the manufacture of vaccines (Morein, B., EP 0 109 942 Bl). These structures have been reported to have adjuvant activity (EP 0 109 942 Bl; WO 96/11711).<br>
The haemolytic saponins QS21 and QS17 (HPLC purified fractions of Quil A) have been described as potent systemic adjuvants, and the method of their production is disclosed in US Patent No.5,057,540 and EP 0 362 279 Bl. Also described in these references is the*use of QS7 (a non-haemolytic fraction of Quil-A) which acts as a potent adjuvant for systemic vaccines. Use of QS21 is further described in Kensil et al. (1991. J. Immunology vol 146,431-437). Combinations of QS21 and polysorbate or cyclodextrin are also known (WO 99/10008). Particulate adjuvant systems comprising fractions of QuilA, such as QS21 and QS7 are described in WO 96/33739 and WO 96/11711.<br>
Other saponins which have been used in systemic vaccination studies include those derived from other plant species-such as Gypsophila and Saponaria (Bomford et al., Vaccine, 10(9):572-577,1992).<br>
Saponins are also known to have been used in mucosally applied vaccine studies, which have met with variable success in the induction of immune responses. Quil-A saponin has previously been shown to have no effect on the induction of an immune response when antigen is administered intranasally (Gizurarson et al. 1994. Vaccine Research 3,23-29). Whilst, other authors have used this adjuvant with success (Maharaj et al., CanJ.Microbiol, 1986,32(5):414-20; Chavali and Campbell, Immunobiology, 174(3):347-59). ISCOMs comprising Quil A saponin have been used in intragastric and intranasal vaccine formulations and exhibited adjuvant activity (Mel Mowat et al, 1991, Immunology, 72,317-322; Mel Mowat and Donachie, Immunology Today, 12,383-385).<br>
QS21, the non-toxic fraction of Quil A, has also been described as an oral or intranasal adjuvant (Sumino et al., J.Virol., 1998,72(6):4931-9; WO 98/56415).<br><br>
The use of other saponins in intranasal vaccination studies has been described. For example, Chenopodium quinoa saponins has been used in both intranasal and intragastric vaccines (Estrada et al, Comp. Immunol. Microbiol. Infect. Dis., 1998, 21(3):225-36).<br>
The present invention relates to the surprising finding that immunostimulatory oligonucleotides (CpG) and saponin combinations are extremely potent adjuvants. Accordingly, there is provided an adjuvant composition comprising a combination of saponin and an immunostimulatory oligonucleotide. Preferably, the adjuvants of the present invention may further comprise a carrier. In a preferred form of the present invention the saponin and oligonucleotides in the adjuvant and vaccine compositions act synergistically in the induction of antigen specific antibody and are potent in the induction of immune responses conventionally associated with the Thl-type immune system. Accordingly, the adjuvant combinations are not only suitable for immunoprophylaxis of diseases, but also surprisingly for immunotherapy of diseases such as persistant viral, bacterial or parasitic infections, and also chronic disorders such as cancer.<br>
The preferred oligonucleotides for use in adjuvants or vaccines of the present invention preferably contain two or more dinucleotide CpG motifs separated by at least three, more preferably at least six or more nucleotides. The oligonucleotides of the present invention are typically deoxynucleotides. In a preferred embodiment the intemucleotide in the oligonucleotide is phosphorodithioate, or more preferably a phosphorothioate bond, although phosphodiester and other intemucleotide bonds are within the scope of the invention including oligonucleotides with mixed intemucleotide linkages. Methods for producing phosphorothioate oligonucleotides or phosphorodithioate are described in US5,666,153, US5,278,302 and WO95/26204.<br>
Examples of preferred oligonucleotides have the following sequences. The sequences preferably contain phosphorothioate modified intemucleotide linkages. OLIGO 1(SEQ ID NO:l): TCC ATG ACG TTC CTG ACG TT (CpG 1826)<br><br>
OLIGO 2 (SEQ ID NO:2): TCT CCC AGC GTG CGC CAT (CpG 1758) OLIGO 3(SEQ ID NO:3): ACC GAT GAC GTC GCC GGT GAC GGC ACC ACG OLIGO 4 (SEQ ID NO:4): TCG TCG TTT TGT CGT TTT GTC GTT (CpG 2006) OLIGO 5 (SEQ ID NO:5): TCC ATG ACG TTC CTG ATG CT (CpG 1668)<br>
Alternative CpG oligonucleotides may comprise the preferred sequences above in that they have inconsequential deletions or additions thereto.<br>
The CpG oligonucleotides utilised in the present invention may be synthesized by any method known ir! the art (eg EP 468520). Conveniently, such oligonucleotides may be synthesized utilising an automated synthesizer.<br>
The oligonucleotides utilised in the present invention are typically deoxynucleotides. In a preferred embodiment the intemucleotide bond in the oligonucleotide is phosphorodithioate, or more preferably phosphorothioate bond, although phosphodiesters are within the scope of the present invention. Oligonucleotide comprising different intemucleotide linkages are contemplated, e.g. mixed phosphorothioate phophodiesters. Other intemucleotide bonds which stabilise the oligonucleotide may be used.<br>
The saponins which may be used in the adjuvant combinations of the present invention include those derived from the bark of Quillaja Saponaria Molina, termed Quil A and fractions thereof, described in US 5,057,540 and "Saponins as vaccine adjuvants", Kensil, C. R., CritRev Titer Drug Carrier Syst, 1996,12 (l-2):l-55; and EP 0 362 279 Bl. Particularly preferred fractions of Quil A are QS21, QS7, and QS17.<br>
P-Escin is another preferred haemolytic saponins for use in the adjuvant compositions of the present invention. Escin is described in the Merck index (12* ed: entry 3737) as a mixture of saponins occurring in the seed of the horse chestnut tree, Lat: Aesculus hippocastanum. Its isolation is described by chromatography and purification (Fiedler, Arzneimittel-Forsch. 4,213 (1953)), and by ion-exchange resins (Erbring et al., US 3,238,190). Fractions of escin, aand p\ have been purified and shown to be<br><br>
biologically active (Yoshikawa M, et al. (Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo) 1996 Aug;44(8):1454-1464)). (5-escin is also known as aescin.<br>
Another preferred haemolytic saponin for use in the present invention is Digitonin. Digitonin is described in the Merck index (12* Edition, entry 3204) as a saponin, being derived from the seeds of Digitalis purpurea and purified according to the procedure described Gisvold et al, J.Am.Pharm.Assoc, 1934,23, 664; and Ruhenstroth-Bauer, Physiol. Chem., 1955,301,621. Its use is described as being a clinical reagent for cholesterol determination.<br>
The adjuvant combinations of the present invention may further comprise a carrier, such that die saponin or CpG, or both, may be associated with a particulate carrier entity to enhance the adjuvanticity of the combination. Particularly preferred systemic vaccines, for example, comprise a carrier molecule.<br>
The CpG used in the adjuvant combinations of the present invention may be in free solution or may be complexed to particulate carriers such as mineral salts (for example, but not restricted to, aluminium or calcium salts), liposomes, ISCOMs, emulsions (oil in water, water in oil, water in oil in water), polymers (such as, but not restricted to polylactic, polyglycolic, polyphosphazine, polyaminoacid, alginate, chitosan) or microparticles. Preferably said carriers are canonic. The vaccines of the present invention further comprise an antigen which may be associated with the CpG-carrier complex, or may not be associated with the CpG-carrier complex. In this case, the antigen may be free suspension or associated with a separate carrier.<br>
The saponins forming part of the present invention may be separate in the form of micelles, or may be in the form of large ordered structures such as ISCOMs (EP 0 109 942 Bl) or liposomes (WO 96/33739) when formulated with cholesterol and lipid, or in the form of an oil in water emulsion (WO 95/17210). The saponins may preferably be associated with a metallic salt, such as aluminium hydroxide or aluminium phosphate (WO 98/15287). Alternatively the saponin may be associated with a particulate carrier such as chitosan. The saponin may also be in a dry state such as a<br><br>
powder. The final formulations in the form as they are administered to the mucosal surface of the vaccinee are preferably haemolytic in nature. The saponin may or may not be associated physically with the antigen either through direct linkage or by co-interaction with the same particulate carrier molecule (GB9822712.7; WO 98/16247). The CpG and saponin in the adjuvants or vaccines of the present invention may themselves be separate or associated. For example, the CpG and saponin may be in free suspension or may be associated via a carrier, more preferably a particulate carrier such as aluminium hydroxide or by a canonic liposome or ISCOM.<br>
A preferred adjuvant combination according to the present invention is composed of one or more CpG oligonucleotides containing at least 3, preferably at least 6 nucleotides between two adjacent CG motifs, together with QS21 and a particulate carrier selected from the group comprising an oil-in-water emulsion or DQ. Most preferably, the adjuvant combination comprises CpG 2006 (SEQ ID NO: 4), or CpG 1758 (SEQ ID NO: 2) or CpG 1826 (SEQ ID NO: 1) mixed with QS21, and a particulate carrier selected from the group comprising an oil-in-water emulsion or DQ. Accordingly, particularly preferred vaccines, for example, comprise such adjuvant combinations and an antigen. The preferred vaccine of the present invention is used to generate systemic immune responses after administration to an individual through the systemic route.<br>
The adjuvant combinations of the present invention may be used as both systemic or mucosal adjuvant In a particular form of the invention there is provided a systemic vaccine to be administered through the systemic or parenteral route such as intramuscular, intradermal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intravenous administration. A preferred route of administration is via the transdermal route, for example by skin patches.<br>
The systemic vaccine preparations of the present invention may be used to protect or treat a mammal susceptible to, or suffering from disease, by means of administering said vaccine by intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intradermal, transdermal, intravenous, or subcutaneous administration. Methods of systemic administration of the vaccine<br><br>
preparations may include conventional syringes and needles, or devices designed for ballistic delivery of solid vaccines (WO 99/27961), or needleless pressure liquid jet device (US 4,596,556; US 5,993,412), or transdermal patches (WO 97/48440; WO 98/28037). The present invention may also be used to enhance the immunogenicity of antigens applied to the skin (transdermal or transcutaneous delivery WO 98/20734 ; WO 98/28037). The present invention therefore provides a delivery device for systemic administration, pre-filled with the vaccine or adjuvant compositions of the present invention. Accordingly there is provided a method for inducing an immune response in an individual, comprising the administration of a vaccine comprising an antigen and immunostimulatory oligonucleotide, a saponin, and a carrier, to the individual, wherein the vaccine is administered via the parenteral or systemic route. Preferred methods of inducing an immune response comprises the administration of a vaccine comprising an oligonucleotide of SEQ ED NO: 1,2,3,4 or 5, with a saponin derived from QuilA, such as QS21, and a carrier, such as an oil in water emulsion, a cholesterol containing liposome or alum.<br>
Alternatively the vaccine preparations of the present invention may be used to protect or treat a mammal susceptible to, or suffering from disease, by means of administering said vaccine via a mucosal route, such as the oral/alimentary or nasal route. Alternative mucosal routes are intravaginal and intra-rectal. The preferred mucosal route of administration is via the nasal route, termed intranasal vaccination. Methods of intranasal vaccination are well known in the art, including the administration of a droplet, spray, or dry powdered form of the vaccine into the nasopharynx of the individual to be immunised. Nebulised or aerosolised vaccine formulations also form part of this invention. Enteric formulations such as gastro resistant capsules and granules for oral administration, suppositories for rectal or vaginal administration also form part of this invention.<br>
The adjuvant combinations of the present invention, represent a class of mucosal adjuvants suitable for application in humans to replace systemic vaccination by ■mucosal vaccination. In a preferred form of the present invention pure saponins such as Quil A, or derivatives thereof, including QS21; Escin; Digitonin; or Gypsophila or<br><br>
Chenopodium quinoa saponins in combination with immunostimulatory oligonucleotides may be used as adjuvants for the mucosal administration of antigens to achieve a systemic immune response.<br>
The adjuvant combinations of the present invention are used in the formulation of vaccines, which vaccines may be administered via the systemic or mucosal route. Preferably, when the vaccines are used for mucosal administration the adjuvant combination comprises a haemolytic saponin.<br>
For mucosal administration preferably the composition of the invention comprise a haemolytic saponin. Haemolytic saponin, or saponin preparation, within the meaning of this invention is to be determined with reference to the following assay.<br>
1.	Fresh blood from guinea pigs is washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) 3 times in a desk-top centrifuge. After resuspension to the original volume the blood is further diluted 10 fold in PBS.<br>
2.	50 ul of this blood suspension is added to 800 ul of PBS containing two-fold dilutions of surfactant or saponin.<br>
3.	After 8 hours the haemolysis is assessed visually or by measuring the optical density of the supernatant. The presence of a red supernatant, which absorbs light at 570 nm indicates the presence of haemolysis.<br>
4.	The results are expressed as the concentration of the first saponin dilution at which hemolysis no longer occurs.<br>
For the purposes of this invention the saponin adjuvant preparation is haemolytic if it lyses the erythrocytes at a concentration of less than 0.1%. As means of reference, substantially pure samples of QuilA, QS21, QS7, Digitonin, and P-escin are all haemolytic saponins as defined in this assay.Within the inherent experimental variability of such a biological assay, the saponins of the present invention preferably have a haemolytic activity, of approximately between 0.5-0.00001%, more preferably between 0.05-0.00001%, even more preferably between 0.005-0.00001%, and most preferably between 0.001-0.0004%. Ideally, said saponins should have a haemolytic activity similar {i.e. within a ten-fold difference) to that of QS21.<br><br>
The vaccines of the present invention may also be administered via the oral route. In such cases the pharmaceutically acceptable excipient may also include alkaline buffers, or enteric capsules or microgranules. The vaccines of the present invention may also be administered by the vaginal route. In such cases, the pharmaceutically acceptable excipients may also include emulsifiers, polymers such as CARBOPOL*. and other known stabilisers of vaginal creams and suppositories. The vaccines of the present invention may also be administered by the rectal route. In such cases the excipients may also include waxes and polymers known in the art for forming rectal suppositories.<br>
Preparations of more than one saponin in the adjuvant combinations of the present invention are also form part of the present invention. For example combinations of at least two of the following group comprising QS21, QS7, Quil A, P-escin, or digitonin. Additionally, the compositions of the present invention may comprise combinations of more than one immunostimulatory oligonucleotide.<br>
In a similar embodiment of the present invention the CpG/saponin combinations for both systemic and mucosal administration may be further combined with other adjuvants including. Monophosphoryl Lipid A and its non-toxic derivative 3-de-O-acylated monophosphoryl lipid A. Alternatively the saponin formulations may be combined with vaccine vehicles composed of chitosan or other polycationic polymers, polylactide and polylactide-co-glycolide particles, poly-N-acetyl glucosamine-based polymer matrix, particles composed of polysaccharides or chemically modified polysaccharides, liposomes and lipid-based particles, particles composed of glycerol monoesters, etc. The saponins may also be formulated in the presence of cholesterol to form particulate structures such as liposomes or ISCOMs. Furthermore, the saponins may be formulated together with a polyoxyethylene ether or ester, in either a non-particulate solution or suspension, or in a particulate structure such as a paucilamelar liposome or ISCOM. The saponins may also be formulated with excipients such as CarbopolR to increase viscosity, or may be formulated in a dry powder form with a powder excipient such as lactose.<br><br>
3 De-O-acylated monophosphoryl lipid A is a well known adjuvant manufactured by Ribi Immunochem, Montana. It can be prepared by the methods taught in GB 2122204B. A preferred form of 3 De-O-acylated monophosphoryl lipid A is in the form of an emulsion having a small particle size less than 0.2um in diameter (EP 0 689 454 Bl). Particularly preferred adjuvants are combinations of 3D-MPL and QS21 (EP 0 671 948 B1), oil in water emulsions comprising 3D-MPL and QS21 (WO 95/17210, WO 98/56414), or 3D-MPL formulated with other carriers (EP 0 689 454 Bl).<br>

EXAMPLE 1 The use ofQSH and CpGfor the intranasal boosting of systemic antibodies to Lipo-OspA<br>
In this example we investigated whether lytic saponins such as QS21 and immunostimulants such as CpG were able to enhance in a synergistic fashion systemic immunological responses to an intranasal boosting vaccination of mice. Female Balb/c mice (5 aShimals per group), aged 8 weeks, were immunized intramuscularly with lipo-OspA (lug) formulated onto alum (50 jig). After 3 months, the mice were boosted intranasally (under anesthesia) with 10 ul of solution (5 ul per nostril, delivered as droplets by pipette) containing 5 ug lipo-OspA in either A: PBS; B: 20 ug CpG 1001 (TCC ATG AGC TTC CTG ACG TT, Krieg 1826); C: 5 ug QS21 (obtained from Cambridge Biotech, USA); D: 20 ug CpG 1001 + 5 ug QS21; or, E: by intra muscular injection of 1 ug lipo-OspA adsorbed onto alum (50 fig). Figures 1 and 2 show the OspA specific IgG titres and LA2 titres 14 days after the nasal boosting.<br>
Methods<br>
ELISA for the measurement of OspA-specific serum IgG in mice: Maxisorp Nunc immunoplates are coated overnight at 4°C with 50 ul/well of 1 ug/ml OspA diluted in PBS (in rows B to H of plate), or with 50 ul of 5 ug/ml purified goat anti-mouse Ig (Boerhinger), in PBS (row A). Free sites on the plates are blocked (1 hour, 37°C) using saturation buffer: PBS containing 1%BSA, 0.1% polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate (TWEEN 20), and 4% Normal Bovine Serum (NBS). Then, serial 2-fold dilutions of IgG isotype mixture, diluted in saturation buffer (50 ul per well) and'added as a standard curve (mixture of mouse monoclonal antibodies IgGl, IgG2a and IgG2b from Sigma, starting at 200 ng/ml and put in row A), and serum samples (starting at a 1/100 dilution and put in rows B to H) are incubated for lhr 30mins at 37°C. The plates are then washed (x3) with washing buffer (PBS, 0.1% polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate (TWEEN 20)). Then, biotinylated goat anti-<br><br>
mouse IgG (Amersham) diluted 1/5000 in saturation buffer are incubated (50 ul/well) for lhr 30mins, at 37°C. After 3 washings, and subsequent addition of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham), plates are washed 5 times and incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 50 ul/well of revelation buffer (OPDA 0.4 mg/ml (Sigma) and H202 0.03% in 50mM pH 4.5 citrate buffer). Revelation is stopped by adding 50 ul/well H2S04 2N. Optical densities are read at 492 and 630 ran by using Biorad 3550 immunoreader. Antibody titers are calculated by the 4 parameter mathematical method using SoftMaxPro software.<br>
Inhibition assay for the measurement of serum LA2-Iike Antibody titres to Hpo-OspA Antibody titres in the vaccinees were studied with respect to their LA2-like specificity. LA2 is a murine monoclonal antibody which recognizes a conformational OspA epitope at the surface of the bacteria and has been shown to be able to kill B. burgdorferi in vitro, as well as to protect mice against a challenge with laboratory-grown spirochete (Schaible UE et al. 1990. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 87:3768-3772). Moreover, LA-2 mab has been shown to correlate with bactericidal antibodies, and studies on human sera showed also a good correlation between the total anti-OspA IgG titers and the LA-2 titers (as measured by ELISA). Maxisorp Nunc immunoplates are coated overnight at 4°C with 50 ul/well of 0.5ug/ml lipo OspA diluted in PBS. Free sites were blocked with saturation buffer for lhr at 37°C with (100 ul/well of saturation buffer PBS/ BSA 1%/ Tween 20 0.1%/ NBS 4%). Serial 2-fold dilutions of LA2 monoclonal Ab (mAb) starting at 4 ug/ml were diluted in saturation buffer (50 ul per well) to form a standard curve. Dilutions of serum samples from the vaccinees (starting at a 1/10 dilution) were also added and the plates incubated for 2hrs at 37°C. The plates were washed after incubation 3 times with PBS/ TWEEN 20 (0.1%). LA2 mAb-peroxidase conjugate (1/10,000) diluted in saturation buffer was added to each well (50 ul/well) and incubated for lhr at 37°C. After 5 washings, plates are incubated for 20 min at room temperature (in darkness) with 50 ul/well of revelation buffer (OPDA 0.4 mg/ml and H202 0.03% in 50mM pH 4.5 citrate buffer). The reaction and colour formation was stopped with H2S04 2N. Optical densities are read at 492 and 630 nm by using Biorad 3550 immunoreader. LA2-like Ab titers are calculated by the 4 parameter mathematical method using<br><br>
SoftMaxPro software. LA2-like antibody titres were determined by comparison with the standard curve.<br>
Results<br>
CpG as well as QS21 improve significantly the intranasal boosting of systemic antibodies to Lipo-OspA. Moreover, when both adjuvants are combined, a synergistic effect on those responses is clearly demonstrated, especially in term of LA2 antibodies. Humoral responses elicited in the presence of QS21 and CpG are significantly higher than those induced by the parenteral booster. Taken together, these results show clearly the potential of intranasal formulations combining a lytic saponin and an immunostimulant.<br>
EXAMPLE 2. Synergistic combination ofQS21 and CpG for enhancing the intranasal boosting of systemic antibodies to influenza virus<br>
In this example we investigated whether haemolytic saponins such as QS21 (see example) and immunostimulants such as CpG were able to enhance in a synergistic fashion the intranasal boost of systemic antibodies in mice primed intranasally with inactivated whole influenza virus.<br>
Female Balb/c mice (10 animals per group), aged 8 weeks, were primed intranasally with (3-propiolactone inactivated trivalent whole influenza virus (A/Beijing/262/95; A/Johannesburg/33/94; B/Panama/45/90; 5 ug HA / strain) for mimicking the natural priming occurring in humans. After 28 days, the mice were boosted intranasally (under anesthesia) with 20 ul of solution (10 ul per nostril, delivered as droplets by pipette) containing 1.5 ug HA / strain of Ji-propiolactone inactivated trivalent whole influenza virus (same strains as in the priming immunization) in either A: PBS; B: 50 ug CpG (TCG TCG TTT TGT CGT TTT GTC GTT, Krieg 2006); C: 4.5 ug QS21 (obtained from Cambridge Biotech, USA); D: 50 ug CpG + 4.5 ug QS21; or, E: by intra muscular injection of 1.5 ug HA / strain of trivalent split influenza virus (same strains as in the priming immunization). Flu antigens were supplied by SSD GmBH manufacturer (Dresden, Germany). Figures 3 and 4 show the serum Flu strain specific IgG titres and HemAgglutination<br><br>
Inhibition (HAI) titres 14 days after the nasal boosting. Methods<br>
ELISA for the measurement of Anti-influenza IgG titres in mice: Maxisorp Nunc immunoplates are coated overnight at 4°C with 50 ul/well of 1 ug/ml whole influenza virus antigen diluted in PBS (in rows B to H of plate), or with 50 ul of 5 ug/ml purified goat anti-mouse Ig (Boerhinger), in PBS (row A). Free sites on the plates are blocked (1 hour, 37°C) using saturation buffer: PBS containing 1%BSA, 0.1% polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate (TWEEN 20), and 4% Normal Bovine Serum (NBS). Then, serial 2-fold dilutions of IgG isotype mixture, diluted in saturation buffer (50 ul per well) and added as a standard curve (mixture of mouse monoclonal antibodies IgGl, IgG2a and IgG2b from Sigma, starting at 200 ng/ml and put in row A), and serum samples (starting at a 1/100 dilution and put in rows B to H) are incubated for lhr 30mins at 37°C. The plates are then washed (x3) with washing buffer (PBS, 0.1% polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate (TWEEN 20)). Then, biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (Amersham) diluted 1/5000 in saturation buffer are incubated (50 ul/well) for lhr 30mins, at 37°C. After 3 washings, and subsequent addition of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham), plates are washed 5 times and incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 50 ul/well of revelation buffer (OPDA 0.4 mg/ml (Sigma) and H,02 0.03% in 50mM pH 4.5 citrate buffer). Revelation is stopped by adding 50 ul/well H2S042N. Optical densities are read at 492 and 630 nm by using Biorad 3550 immunoreader. Antibody titers are calculated by the 4 parameter mathematical method using SoftMaxPro software. The Whole influenza virus used for the coating (strain A/Beijing/262/95), inactivated with p-propiolactone (BPL), is supplied by SSD GmBH manufacturer (Dresden, Germany).<br>

After centrifugation (30 minutes, 3000 RPM or 860 g), 100 ul supernatant (corresponding<br><br>
to a 1/10 dilution of the serum) are taken and incubated for 1 hour at 4°C with 0.5% chicken red blood cells. Supernatant is collected after centrifugarion for 10 minutes at 3200 RFM (970 g). Both operations are done for eliminating the natural hemagglutinating factors contained in the sera. Then, 25 ul treated-sera are diluted in 25 |il PBS (serial 2-fold dilutions starting at 1/20) in 96 well Greiner plates. BPL inactivated whole virus is added (25 ul / well) at a concentration of 4 Hemagglutination Units (i.e. at a dilution which is 4-fold lower than the last one provoking an agglutination of red blood cells) for 30 minutes at RT under agitation. Chicken red blood cells are then added (25 ul / well) for 1 hour at RT. Plates are finally kept overnight at 4°C before to be read. The HAI titer corresponds to the last serum dilution inhibiting the virus-induced hemagglutination.<br>
Results<br>
CpG as well as QS21 do not improve the intranasal boosting of IgG or HAI antibodies to Flu strains. However, when both adjuvants are combined, a synergistic effect on those responses is clearly demonstrated The HAI responses elicited in the presence of QS21 and CpG are even similar than those induced by the parenteral booster. These results confirm the potential of intranasal formulations combining a haemolytic saponin and an immunostimulant. They also show that several CpG sequences can be efficient in this context (Krieg 2006 in the present example and Krieg 1826 in the examples 3 and 5).<br>
EXAMPLE 3. Synergistic combination offi-Escin and CpG for enhancing the intranasal boosting of systemic antibodies to Lipo-OspA<br>
We assess in the present example the possibility that a synergy similar to that<br>
observed between QS21 and CpG could be obtained with other haemolytic saponins<br>
(see example) such as (3-Escin. The non haemolytic saponin, glycyrrhizic acid, is also<br>
tested.<br>
Female Balb/c mice (6 animals per group), aged 8 weeks, were primed<br>
intramuscularly with lipo-OspA (lug) formulated onto alum (50 ug). After 3 months,<br>
the mice were boosted intranasally (under anesthesia) with 10 ul of solution (5 ul per<br><br>
nostril, delivered as droplets by pipette) containing 5 \ig lipo-OspA in either A: PBS; B: 50 ug CpG 1001 (TCC ATG AGC TTC CTG ACG TT, Krieg 1826); C: 5 ug p-Escin (purchased from Sigma); D: 50 ug CpG 1001 + 5 u.g JJ-Escin; E: 5 ug glycyrrhizic acid (purchased from Sigma); F: 50 ug CpG 1001 + 5 u.g glycyrrhizic acid or, G: by intra muscular injection of 1 ug lipo-OspA adsorbed onto alum (50 u.g). Figure 5 shows the OspA specific-LA2 titres 14 days after the nasal boosting.<br>
Methods<br>
The methods are*the same as those detailed in Example 1.<br>
Results<br>
P-Escin and CpG act synergistically for enhancing the intranasal boosting of systemic LA2 Abs. This combination elicits more elevated Ab responses than the parenteral booster. On the other hand, such a synergy is not obtained by combining CpG with glycyrrhizic acid.<br>
These results and the previous ones of this patent taken together show the ability of CpG and different haemolytic saponins to adjuvant immune responses in a synergistic fashion.<br>
EXAMPLE 4. Jmmunogenicity studies using P. falciparum RTS,S andHW-1 gp!20 formulated with CpG and/or DQS21<br>
1. Experiment outline<br>
Two mouse immunogenicity studies were conducted to evaluate potential additive or synergistic effects of CpG oligonucleotides (CpG) and QS21. Groups of mice were immunized with RTS,S and gpl20 formulated with CpG and QS21 alone or in combination. These adjuvant combinations were also tested in the presence of the carrier Al(OH)3 or an oil-in-water (o/w) emulsion.<br>
The immunogenicity of the formulations was examined after two parenteral immunizations. Sera were analyzed for the presence of antigen-specific antibodies,<br><br>
and for the distribution of antibody isotypes. Spleen cells were used to evaluate cell-mediated immune responses. Those cells were tested for the presence of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and lymphoproliferative Oymphoproliferation) cells.<br><br>
2. Formulation 2.1. Experiment 1<br>
Formulation process:<br>
Formulations were prepared three days before each injection. When needed, RTS,S (10 ug) and gp 120 (lOug) were adsorbed on 100 ug of AL(OH)3. When needed, MPL (S ug) was added and incubated 30 min before buffer addition as a mix of 10-fold concentrated PBS pH 7.4 and H20 excepted for the group without DQ for which the buffer was P04, NaCl 10/150 pH 6.8. After 30 min, if needed, QS21 (5 ug) mixed with liposomes in a weight ratio QS21/cholesterol of 1/5 (referred to as DQ) was added to the formulation.  Thirty minutes later, for the formulations with the oligo,<br><br>
100 ug of CpG was added 30 min prior addition of 50 ug/ml of thiomersal as preservative.<br><br>
All incubations were carried out at room temperature with agitation. 2.2. Experiment 2<br>
Formulation process:<br>
Formulations are performed simultaneously for both injections. The volume of injection for one mouse is 100 ul. Fifty ug/ml of thiomersal is added as preservative.<br>
Group 1 : RTS,S (10 ug) and gp 120 (10 ug) are diluted with H20 and PBS pH 6.8 for isotonicity. After 5 min., the formulation is adsorbed on CpG 1856 (100 ug).<br>
Group 2; RTS.S (10 ug) and gpl20 (10 ug) are diluted with H20 and PBS pH 7.4 for isotonicity. After 30 minutes RTS.S and gpl20 are adsorbed on DQ (5 ug). After 30 min of adsorption, the formulation is adsorbed on CpG 1856 (100 ug).<br>
Group 3 : RTS,S (10 ug) and gpl20 (10 ug) are diluted with H,0 and PBS pH 6.8 for isotonicity. After 5 min., the formulation is adsorbed on an o/w emulsion. After 5 min. of adsorption, the formulation is adsorbed on QS21 (5 ug) prior the addition of CpG (100 fig).<br>
3. Immunological methods<br>
Nine (Balb/C x C57B1/6) Fl mice per group received into the hind footpads 2 x 50 ul vaccine twice at a two-week-interval. Two weeks later sera were obtained to assess antibody responses, and spleen cells were harvested to determine cell-mediated immune responses.<br>
For lymphoproliferation analysis, cells were seeded in quadruplicates in 96-well round-bottomed microtiter plates at a concentration of 2x106 per ml. Cells were<br><br>
cultured for 72 or 96 hrs in RPMI-1640 supplemented with antibiotics, glutamine and 1 % (v/v) normal mouse serum in the presence of different concentrations of RTS,S or gpl20 antigen. Control cells were cultured without antigen. Then the cells were pulsed overnight with luCi/well [3H]-mymidine, harvested and the incorporated radioactivity was determined in a beta-counter. Results are expressed as mean counts per minute (cpm).<br>
For CTL analysis cells were cultured for 7 days in 6-well plates in the presence of 10 ug per ml of synthetic peptide pCMI003 (IPQSLDSWWTSL) corresponding to an HBsAg CTL epitope (Schirmbeck et al., 1995) or peptide pCMI007 (GIHIGPGRAFYAARK) representing an gpl20 CTL epitope (Casement et al., 1995). At the end of the culture period effector cells were assessed in duplicate for HBsAg-specific cytolytic activity in standard [s,Cr]-release assays using control and S-transfected P815 cells. Gpl20-specific cytotoxicity was determined by using P815 target cells that were either left untreated or pulsed for 1 hr with peptide pCMI007. Minimum and maximum release were determined with target cells without effector cells and by the addition of 3 % (v/v) Triton X-100, respectively. Results are expressed as % [51Cr]-release (cpm of experimental culture - cpm of spontaneous release / cpm of maximum release - cpm of spontaneous release).<br>
Titration and isotyping of pooled sera was performed in a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) format using plates coated with HbsAg. Sera were diluted in PBS/BSA starting at 1:400. Biotinylated secondary antibodies specific for Ig or the isotypes IgGl, IgG2a and IgG2b followed by a horseradish peroxydase-streptavidin conjugate were used for detection of bound antibodies. ELISA titers were calculated from a reference by SoftmaxPro and expressed in ELISA units (EU/ml). Gpl20-specinc antibody titers were determined in a standard ELISA using plates coated with gpl20 protein. Sera were diluted in PBS/Tween20/BSA starting at 1:100. Biotinylated secondary antibodies specific forlg or the isotypes IgGl, IgG2a and IgG2b followed by a horseradish peroxydase-streptavidin conjugate were used for detection of bound antibodies. Titers were calculated in relative to a standard mouse Ig and expressed as ug/ml.<br><br>
4. Results Experiment 1<br>
Analysis of lymphoproliferation responses did not show any significant differences in reactivity to RTS,S between the groups. In contrast, the groups 1 and 3 containing both, CpG and DQS21, showed better gpl20-specific Lymphoprolypheration responses than the groups containing CpG or DQS21 alone (Figure 6).<br>
In this experiment only HBsAg-specific CTL were measured. There was no pronounced difference in CTL induction between the groups 1 and 3 having received CpG and DQS21 in combination and the groups 2 and 4 immunized with only one of the two adjuvant components, while the presence of Al(OH)3 diminished the CTL activity observed for the combination of CpG and DQS21 in group 1 (Figure 7). However, a trend was present that CpG and DQS21 was better than DQS21 alone, and the combination induced more CTL in the presence of Al(OH)3 than CpG alone (Figure 7).<br>
The humoral immune response of the mice was examined only for the presence of HBsAg-specific antibodies. Titers were similar in all groups expect for group 3, which showed an approximately three-fold increase, demonstrating that, in the presence of AJ(OH)j, the combination of DQS21 and CpG is more immunogenic than CpG alone (Figure 8). The isotype distribution was similar for the Al(OH)3-containing groups 3 and 4, while in the absence of Al(OH)3 the combination of CpG and DQS21 induced a stronger TH,-like isotype pattern than DQS21 alone (Figure 8).<br>
Experiment 2<br>
Lymphoproliferation responses specific for RTS.S and gpl20 were very similar in this experiment. The data indicate that the addition of DQS21 (either alone or with an o/w emulsion) enhances lymphoproliferation responses to both antigens (Figure 9).<br><br>
CTL responses were evaluated by using both, an HBsAg and a gpl20 CTL epitope peptide. In both cases, CTL could be detected after immunization of group 1 with CpG alone (Figure 10). However, addition of DQS21 resulted in a considerable increase in CTL for both antigens (Figure 10). The presence of an o/w emulsion either neutralized the positive effect of DQS21 (gpl20) or increased the background of the in vitro assay (HBsAg).<br>
Antibody responses to HBsAg and gpl20 increased by addition of DQS21 to the CpG adjuvant (Figure 11 A). A further increase was observed when an o/w emulsion was included in the formulation (Figure 11 A). Addition of DQS21 to CpG shifted the gpl20 isotype profiles towards a more pronounced TH1 bias (Figure 1 IB), while the impact on the HBsAg isotype profiles was less pronounced in this experiment.<br>
S. Conclusions<br>
Immunization with RTS.S and gpl20 formulated with the combination of CpG and DQS21 results in strong antigen-specific immune responses. The combination of the adjuvant components CpG and DQS21<br>
-	enhances lymphoproliferation responses<br>
-	increases CTL activity<br>
-	augments antibody titers and TH1 isotype patterns<br>
as compared to the single components.<br>
EXAMPLE 5. Therapeutic potential of CpG and/or DQS21 formulations in TCI tumour model<br>
1.   Experimental design<br><br>
Four groups of 10 mice C57bl/6 received 10e6 (200 ul) TCI cells (E7 expressing<br>
tumour cells) subcutaneous at day 0 in the flank.<br>
Mice were then vaccinated twice at day 14 and 21 after the tumour challenge, with 5<br>
ug of formulated PD1/3E7 HPV16 injected intra-footpad. Tumour growth was<br>
measured individually twice a week.<br>
Groups of mice:<br>
1.	No vaccine<br>
2.	PD1/3E7 + CPG (10 ug ODN 2006)<br>
3.	PD1/3E7 + DQS21 (0.5 ug)<br>
4.	PD1/3E7 + CPG + DQS21<br>
The tumour growth was monitored by measuring individual tumours, twice a week.<br>
2.	Formulations<br>
Formulations were performed the days of injections. The volume of injection for one mouse was 100 u.1. When needed, PD1/3E7 (5 fig) was diluted with H20 and PBS pH 7.4 for isotonicity. After 5 min., if needed QS21 (0.5 ug) mixed with liposomes in a weight ratio QS21/cholesterol of 1/5 (referred to as DQ) was added to the formulation. 30 min later, for the formulation with the oligo, 10 ug of CpG (ODN 2006) was added 30 min prior addition of 1 ug/ml of thiomersal as preservative.<br><br>
3.	Results<br>
The evolution of the mean tumour growth per groups of 10 animals over time is shown in Figure 12.100% of the animals that received a tumour challenge of 10e6 TCI cells progressively developed growing tumour.<br>
70-80% of the non vaccinated animals or of the animals vaccinated with the E7 protein in DQS21 died by day 35.<br><br>
Two vaccinations with the E7 protein formulated in DQS21 had almost no effect on tumour growth. On the contrary, 2 vaccinations, IFP (day 14,21) with 5 ug ProtD 1/3 E7 HPV16 in CPG adjuvant induced the regression of these pre-established tumours and protect mice from dying: 70- 80% of the mice were still alive at day 35. The combination of the 2 inmiunostimulants CPG and DQS21 showed a slight beneficial effect over the CpG used alone.<br><br><br><br>
