				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of photo-<br>
curable compositions for dry resist applications. More particularly, it relates to a<br>
process for the preparation of photo-curable compositions that are aqueous<br>
developable formulations and useful for image transfer applications. The photo-<br>
curable compositions prepared by the process of this invention is prepared by using a<br>
polymer solution containing multi-functional groups. In our copending application<br>
number	we have described and claimed a process for the preparation of<br>
copolymers with multifunctional groups.<br>
The photo-curable compositions prepared by the process of this invention are useful for transfer of image onto a printed circuit board or lithographic plate as dry resists.<br>
Dry resists are important imaging system which are extensively used in the manufacture of wire boards and printed circuit boards. The dry resist essentially consists of a photocurable composition sandwiched between a polyester base sheet and a polyethylene cover foil. In applications, the cover foil is removed and the base sheet is laminated onto a copper clad insulating support. The copper clad insulating support is then selectively exposed to UV source through a photomask. The photomask comprises of parts that are opaque and others transparent to UV source. The differential parts of the photomask thus transfer an image to the copper clad insulating support.<br>
The photo-curable compositions prepared as per the process of this invention, fall into the category of negative photoresists. In this category of photoresists, the areas exposed to UV source, become insoluble in a developing solution as a result of the photochemical reaction occurring during<br><br>
exposure to UV source. The unexposed areas are soluble in the developing solution and can be removed whereby an image is transferred to the copper clad insulating support.<br>
In  the   formulation   of photo-curable   composition,   the   essential<br>
•<br>
ingredients are the polymer solution which normally consists of a tri, tetra polymer with composition of choice, a dye, a sensitizer, crosslinking monomer, photo-initiator, solvent. However, if the composition has to be as a formulation in applications such as PCB industries, the parameters that go into the preparation of the compositions becomes critical. If the right ingredients are not maintained the coating thickness would vary and the non-uniformity would pose problems in processing.<br>
The known compositions available suffers from the disadvantage that the formulations cannot be changed to suit the convenience of the user so that minor changes in terms of exposure time, and processing parameters. The formulation should give uniform film forming characteristics. The primary requirements for applications in electronics industries are -<br>
1.	The polymer should contain carboxylic acid groups such that the<br>
polymer after exposure to UV source should be aqueous soluble.<br>
2.	The polymer should have sufficient mechanical strength so that<br>
during the processing stage, the film remains in tact.<br>
3.	The polymer should contain aromatic groups so that quantum<br>
efficiency during the photochemical reaction step is possible.<br><br>
4. The glass temperature of the polymer should be close to ambient temperature.<br>
These characteristics should not be disturbed while making a suitable formulation.<br>
The main object of the present invention is therefore to provide a process for the preparation of photo-curable compositions with improved film characteristics and aqueous developable.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of photo-curable compositions such that the glasss transition temperature and mechanical strength are not altered.<br>
Yet another object of the present: invention is to provide a process for the preparation of photo-curable compositions that does no disturb the photochemical reaction to give image of choice after developing.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of photo-curable composition for dry resist application comprises, mixing in an yellow light atmosphere, photo-curable polymer solution as herein described with 0.1 to 5.0% of an organic dye as herein described, 0.1 to 0.5% of sensitizer like benzophenone, michlers ketone as photo-initiator, cross linking monomer and a solvent as herein described for a period ranging form 20 to 60 minutes, at a temperature in the range of 25 to 35°C, till uniform consistency us achieved and collecting the product in the form of a solution.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of photo-curable compositions with improved viscosity which comprises, reacting in an inert atmosphere, a photo-curable formulation prepared as described and claimed in our copending application number with an aliphatic amine for a period ranging from 10 to 30 minutes, at a temperature in the range of 25 to 35°C and collecting the resultant product in the form of a solution.<br>
In one of the embodiments of the invention, the inert gas used may be nitrogen, argon.<br>
In another embodiment the aliphatic amine used may be hexylamine, octyl amine, dodecyl amine and the concentration used may be 0.1 to 0.05%.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the photo-curable formulation used may be prepared by mixing in an yellow light atmosphere, a photo-curable polymer solution with an organic dye, a sensitizer, photo-initiator, crosslinking monomer, solvent, for a period ranging from 20 to 60 minutes, at a temperature in the range of 25 to 35°C, till uniform consistency is achieved and collecting the product in the form of a solution.
