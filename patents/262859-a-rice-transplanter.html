DESC ~IPTION<br><br><br><br>
WORKING VEHICLE<br><br><br><br>
TECHNICAL P1 I~LD<br><br>
The present invention relates to a working vehicle such as a rice-planting machine, which is provided with a seedling-placement platform and a seedling planting claw to continuously perform a seedling planting operation, a tractor or a combine harvester.<br><br><br><br>
EACKOROUND ART<br><br>
There has been conventionally a technique using a hydrostatic transmission (HST) constituted of a variable displacement-type hydraulic pump and a hydraulic motor as a traveling speed change device in a ricc~ planting machine, in which only a lever for operating the speed change device is used to change an angle of a swash plate of the transmission (see, for example, Japanese Patent No. 2979580).<br><br>
Normally, in conventional rice-planting machine, during work, a vehicle speed is changed by manipulating a speed-changing lever with an acceleration lever for changing an engine speed being at a high-speed position. However, the engine is held at a high speed as long as the acceleration lever i~i not returned from the high-speed position to a low-speed position, even if the speed-changing lever is turned to a neutral-position so as to stop the machine during a seedling rooting operation,<br><br><br><br>

thereby inhibiting a silent work. In addition, when a hydrostatic l;ransmission is operated at a high speed with an engine being held at a low speed, there may be a fear that. an output from the engine becomes short, or when a clutch mechanism is in engaged with both the hydrostatic 1;ran~mission and the engine being held at high speed, there may be a fear that the machine is abruptly started.<br><br><br><br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE IN'~tNTION<br><br>
A working vehicle according to the preRent invention indudes a speed change device that is driven by an output of an engine and changes a working speed, wherein a working speed change operation member for operating a speed change of the speed change device and an engine revolution change member for changing a rotational speed of the engine are interlocked through a connection member. Consequently, the rotational speed of the engine is made to be low with certainty when the working vehicle travels at a low speed or is stopped, thereby silently and effectively driving the engine so as to excellently perform a work.<br><br>
Furthermore, the working vehicle may further include an engine revolution change operation member for operating the engine revolution change member, wherein the engine revolution change member is operated by both of the engine revolution change operation member and the working speed change operation member when the engine revolution change operation member is at a low speed position, and the engine revolution change member is operated only by the engine revolution change operation<br><br><br>

member when the engine revolution change operation member is at a high speed position. As a consequence, an optimum working speed (traveling) mode is accurately selected according to various kinds of working conditions, for example, at the time of an escape from an ill-drained paddy field, in which the working vehicle must travel at a low speed with a high torquc. thereby enhancing workability.<br><br>
Moreover, the engine revolution change operation member and the working speed change operation member are connected to the engine revolution change member via a bifurcated wire and, also, a resilient member is interposed between the working speed change operation member and the wire. Thus, it is possible to prevent any variation of operation by increasing an operating stroke on the side of the working speed change operation member more than th~~t on the side of the engine revolution change operation member with a simple structure using the wire and the resilient member such as a spring, so as to change the working speed at a stable rotational speed of the engine all the time, thereby enhancing working reliability.<br><br><br><br>

The frame 85 is configured to connect the front frame 43 with the steering wheel column 73 and the like. According to this construction, even in a structure in which the electrical components 84 are disposed at a position above and in the vicinity of the engine 2, it is possible to reduce an adverse influence such as direct transmission of the heat of the engine 2 to the electrical components 84 and eliminate an inconvenience of transmission of heat generated at the electrical components 84 to the air cleaner 75, thus stably maintaining performance (i.e., a quality) of each of the electrical components 84 and the air cleaner 75.<br><br>
As shown in FIGS. 16 to 18, a throttle lever 87 for the engine 2 is disposed at a position under the air discharge cover 78. The throttle lever 87 is interlocked with the acceleration lever 31 disposed rightward of the steering wheel 14 and the speed change pedal 30 disposed under the acceleration lever 31. through a bifurcated acceleration wire 88.

the meantime, a tip of a single wire S8c is connected to the throttle lever 87,<br><br>
so that the rotational speed of the engine can be changed by operation of<br><br>
either of the speed change pedal 30 and the acceleration lever 31. The speed change pedal 30 is oscillatably connected to a pedal shaft<br><br>
S9 via a pedal arm 90. A speed change operation cam 91 is fixedly connected to the pedal shaft 89. The operation cam 91 is connected to a control shaft 92 for adjusting an angle of a swash plate of the HST 48 (i.e., a hydraulic pump) via a speed change rod 93. There is provided a speed holding cam 96 having a notch claw 95 which is adapted to engage with a notch 94 formed at the operation cam 91. The control shaft 92 is turned around its axis to change a vehicle traveling speed by pedaling the speed change pedal 30.<br><br>
To the pedal arm 90 is connected an outer tube 98 of the wire 88a via an outer receiver 97. Furthermore, a resilient member such as a spring 99 is connected at a first end thereof to the tip of the wire 88a and is also connected at a second end thereof to a 6xed frame 101, to which a base end pivotal shaft 100 for the speed change pedal 30 is fixed. According to the construction, pedaling the speed change pedal 30 causes the outer l;ube 98 to move relative to the wire SSa (i.e., an inner wire). The relative movement between the outer tube 98 and the wire 88a causes the throttle lever 87 to be operated so that the vehicular speed and the rotational speed of the engine are changed.<br><br>
As shown in FIG. 19, the wire SSb connected to the acceleration<br><br>

locking member 103. The wire 88a that has the first end connected to the speed change pedal 30 and the wire 8Sb that has the first end connected to the acceleration lever 31 are connected at second ends thereof to a single connector 104. The connector 104 is slidably inserted within a joint 106 connected to the respective outer tubes 98 and 105 of the wires SSa and SSb. When both of the speed change pedal 30 and the acceleration lever 31. are at nonoperation positions (at 0 positions), both the wire 8Sa and the wire SSb do not apply tension force on the connector 104, so that the connector 104 is held at an initial position indicated by a virtual line in FIG. 19. On the other hand, when either one of the wires SSa and 8Sb is tensed by the operation of the speed change pedal 30 or the acceleration lever 31., the connector 104 moves inside of the joint 106 along with the single wire SSc by a predei;ermined stroke L from the initial position, as indicated by a solid line in FIG. 1.9. The movement of the wire 88c causes the throttle lever 87 to be turned onto a high speed H side.<br><br>
As described above, when the acceleration lever 31 serving as an engine revolution change operation member for operating the throttle lever 87 is at the non-operation position or a low-speed position, the wire 88b is loosened so that the connector 104 is at the initial position where either one of the speed change pedal 30 and the acceleration lever 31 can move the connector 104 via the corresponding wire 88a and 83b. On the other hand, when the acceleration lever 31 is at the high-speed position H, the connector 104 is moved by the stroke L onto the high-speed side where the speed change pedal 30 cannot move the connector 104 and the only acceleration<br><br><br>

lever 31 can move the connector 104. As a consequence, an optimum working speed (traveling) mode is accurately selected according to various kinds of working conditions, for example, at the time of an escape from an ill-drained paddy field, in which the tr~iveling vehicle must travel at a low speed with a high torque, thereby enhancing workabiitvi<br><br>
As shown in FIGS. 20 and 21, the fixed frame 101 is fixed at the fore and rear ends thereof between a fixed bracket 107 disposed at the rear end of the front portion frame 39 and an attachment member lOS disposed at the front end of the rear portion frame 41. The speed change pedal 30 is oscillatably supported at the base end thereof via the pivotal shaft 100 by a pedal mount 109 that is secured to the upper surface of the fixed frame 1.01..<br><br>
Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 22, the wire 88a may be configured to be connected directly to the operation cam 91 or the pedal ~rm 90 via the spring 99.<br><br>
As is clear from the above description, the working vehicle includes the hydrostatic transmission ~IST~ 48 that is driven by the output of the engine 2 and changes the working speed such as the vehicular speed, wherein the speed change pedal .30 serving as a working speed change operation member for operating the speed change of the HST 48 and the throttle lever 87 serving as an engine revolution change member for changing the rotational speed of the engine are interlocked through the acce1er~tion wire 88 serving as a connection member. Consecjuentlv, the rotational. speed of the engine also is made to be low with certainty when the working vehicle travels at the low speed or is stopped, thereby silently<br><br><br>

driving the engine with the effectiveness, so as to excellently perform the work. The silent work c~n be automatically achieved during the seedling rooting work or the like. Moreover, it is possible to prevent any inconvenience such as an output shortage of the engine '2 when the speed change device 48 is operated ~t the high speed H while the engine is operated at the iow speed. In addition, the working vehicle can not only travel but also be smoothly started or stopped at the low rotational speed of the engine at the time of the start or stoppage.<br><br>
Furthermore, the acceleration lever 31 and the speed change pedal 30 are connected to the throttle lever 87 via the bifurcated wire 88 and, also, the variation prevention spring 99 serving as the resilient member is interposed between the speed change pedal 30 and the wire 88. Thus, it is possible to prevent any variation in operation by increasing the operating stroke on the side of the speed change pedal 30 more than that on the side of the acceleration lever 31 with a simple means using the wire 88 and the spring 99, so as to change the working speed at the stable rotational speed of the engine all the time, thereby enhancing working reliability. Thus, it is possible to achieve the excellent high-speed work, in which both of the speed change pedal 30 and the acceleration lever 31 are located at the highspeed position.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
