				<td>COMPRESSOR WITH SECONDARY<br>
BOOST AIR OUTLET PASSAGE<br>
This invention relates to a compressor with a secondary boost air outlet. A<br>
compressor may be used to compress gases other than air, and the present invention is<br>
not limited to a compressor which compresses only air. The term "air" as used<br>
throughout this specification should therefore be interpreted as covering any gas. The<br>
invention relates in particular to a turbocharger incorporating a wastegate and<br>
pneumatic wastegate actuator, and more particularly to a command valve arrangement<br>
for controlling the operation of the wastegate actuator.<br>
Turbocllargers are well known devices for supplying air to the intake of an<br>
internal combustion engine at pressures above atmospheric (boost pressures), and are<br>
widely used irl automobiles and the like as well as in industrial applications. A<br>
conventional turbocharger essentially comprises an exhaust gas driven turbine wheel<br>
mounted on a rotatable shaft within a turbine housing. For instance, in a centripetal<br>
turbine the turbine housing defines an annular inlet passageway around the turbine<br>
wheel and a generally cylindrical axial outlet passageway extending from the turbine<br>
wheel. Rotation of the turbine wheel rotates a compressor wheel mounted on the<br>
other end of the shaft within a compressor housing. The rotating compressor wheel<br>
compresses inlet air and delivers the compressed air to the intake manifold of the<br>
engine, thereby increasing engine power.<br>
It is also well known to provide turbochargers with a bypass passageway<br>
between the exhaust inlet and the exhaust outlet portions of the turbine housing to<br>
enable control of the turbocharger boost pressure andlor shaft speed. A wastegate<br>
valve is locateti in the bypass passageway and is controlled to open the passageway<br>
when the pressure level of the boost air increases towards a pre-determined level, thus<br>
allowing some of the exhaust gas to by-pass the turbine wheel preventing the boost<br>
pressure from rising above said level. The wastegate valve is generally actuated by a<br>
pneumatic actuator operated by boost air pressure delivered by the compressor wheel.<br>
The conventional pneumatic actuator comprises a spring-loaded diaphragm (or<br>
a spring loaded sliding seal) housed within a canister, often referred to as the<br>
wastegate actuator can. The actuator can is connected by an airline to the compressor<br>
outlet and is generally mounted on the compressor housing. Communication with the<br>
compressor outlet is via a secondary boost air outlet passage such as a port formed in<br>
the compressor housing. The diaphragm/sliding seal acts on a connecting rod which<br>
extends to the wastegate valve assembly which is mounted in the turbine housing.<br>
The spring bias is such that under low boost pressure conditions the wastegate valve<br>
remains closed. However, when the boost pressure (which is transmitted to the<br>
actuator can from the compressor outlet via the secondary boost air outlet and the<br>
airline) reaches a pre-detennined maximum the diaphragm is moved against the<br>
action of the spring and operates to open the wastegate valve (via the connecting rod)<br>
thereby allowing some exhaust gas to bypass the turbine wheel.<br>
The actuator can is generally connected to the compressor outlet by a flexible<br>
hose. In many cases the connection is direct. However, it is also known to provide a<br>
bleed valve, also referred to as a command valve, in the airline which responds to<br>
appropriate control signals (for instance from the engine management system) to<br>
effectively varj the pressure transmitted to the wastegate actuator can by venting to<br>
atmosphere. This provides for additional control of the wastegate valve over and<br>
above the basic operation dependent upon the pre-determined spring bias. For<br>
instance, the command valve may be operated to effectively modify the pressure at<br>
which the waslegate valve will begin to open which may be desirable in certain<br>
engiile operating conditions.<br>
Wastegate actuator control is not the only situation in which it is necessary to<br>
extract boost a r from the outlet of a compressor via a secondary boost air outlet<br>
passage. For instance, one conventional method of preventing compressor surge is to<br>
install a solenoid valve in an air line ported to the compressor outlet via a secondary<br>
boost air outlet passage to controllably vent boost air fi-om the outlet under conditions<br>
at which the colnpressor is likely to surge. The vented air may typically be vented to<br>
atmosphere via a silencer or returned to the compressor inlet for re-circulation through<br>
the compressor.<br>
Where a valve is used to control the boost air flow through the secondary<br>
boost air outlet passage, it is quite common to mount the valve at a location remote<br>
from the compressor. For instance, some valves are constructed largely from plastic<br>
and therefore must be mounted away from the turbocharger at a cool part of the<br>
engine. Inevitably, remote mounting of the valve (whatever its function) requires<br>
extra air lines and associated fittings. A solution to this problem is provided by<br>
Japanese patent application S62-35565 (laid-open patent application S 63-205419<br>
filed in February 1987). This discloses mounting a solenoid valve directly to the<br>
compressor housing in order to avoid extra air line connections between the valve and<br>
the compressor. The compressor housing is provided with an integral valve mount<br>
located on ar: outside surface of the housing and including a first air port in<br>
communicatio~ with the compressor outlet volute and a second air port in<br>
comm~nicatiow~it~h the compressor air intake. The mount has means for attaching<br>
the solenoid valve and forming a leak-tight seal between the valve and the first and<br>
second air p o ~psr ovided in the valve mount. In this particular instance, the solenoid<br>
valve is provided for surge prevention and thus operates to selectively control flow of<br>
boost air from the compressor outlet to the compressor inlet (via the first and second<br>
air ports respectively) to avoid surge. Exactly the same valve mounting arrangement<br>
has been used for mounting a wastegate actuator command valve, see for instance lJS<br>
6,205,784.<br>
A problem with the known arrangements for extracting air from a compressor<br>
outlet via a secondary boost air outlet passage is that any oil, dirt etc present in the air<br>
is fed to the downstream component (such as a valve or wastegate actuator) which<br>
over time can compromise the operation of the component. For instance, valve ports<br>
can become at least partially clogged by the build-up of oil and particulate material<br>
present in the goost air. This can be particularly problematical where the compressor<br>
is part of a turbocharger fitted to a combustion engine with a closed crank case<br>
ventilation system (CCV). Closed cranked case ventilation is becoming increasingly<br>
prevalent in order to meet modem stringent exhaust emission regulations.<br>
It is a? object of the present invention to obviate or mitigate the above<br>
disadvantages.<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a<br>
compressor for compressing a gas, the compressor comprising a compressor wheel<br>
rotatably mounted within a compressor housing, the compressor housing having a gas<br>
inlet and having a gas outlet volute disposed around the compressor wheel, and<br>
defined by an inner surface or surfaces of the housing, for supplying gas at boost<br>
pressures, a secondary boost gas outlet passage provided in communication with the<br>
outlet volute, wherein the secondary boost gas outlet passage is defined at least in part<br>
by a projectior. which extends into the volute so that the upstream end of the passage<br>
opens at a location spaced from the volute surface.<br>
By locating the inlet of the secondary boost gas passage away from the surface<br>
of the volute the amount of oilldirt etc passing into the passage can be reduced or<br>
eliminated entirely. This is because the oilidirt etc is centrifilged to the volute surface<br>
by the gas flow swirling through the volute and the air flow away from the surface is<br>
clean.<br>
Accordmg to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a<br>

between the valve mount and ihe compressor outlet volute, and a second internal<br>
passage communicating between the valve mount and the compressor intake inlet;<br>
wherein the first passage is defined at least in part by a projection which<br>
extends into the volute so that the upstream end of the passage opens at a location<br>
spaced from the volute surface.<br>
According to a third aspect of the present invention there is provided a<br>
wastegated turbocharger comprising:<br>
a turbine wheel mounted to a shaft for rotation within a turbine housing, the<br>
turbine housing provided with a wastegate valve assembly;<br>

the valve boost air inlet, and a vent passage communicating directly between the valve<br>
vent outlet and the compressor intake inlet;<br>
wherein the boost air passage is defined at least in part by a projection which<br>
extends into the volute so that the upstream end of the passage opens at a location<br>
spaced from the volute surface.<br>
Specific embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way<br>
of example on;y, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is an axial cross-section through a conventional turbocharger<br>
illustrating the major components of a turbocharger;<br>
Figure 2 illustrates details of a conventional turbocharger wastegate valve and<br>
actuator assembly;<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic perspective external view of a turbocharger<br>
incorporating the present invention; and<br>
Figure 4 is a cross-section through part of the turbocharger compressor<br>
housing and command valve assembly of Figure 3.<br>
Figures 5-8 are cross-sections through further embodiments of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring first to figure 1, this illustrates the basic components of a<br>
conventional centripetal type turbocharger. The turbocharger comprises a turbine 1<br>
joined to a cornpressor 2 via a central bearing housing 3. The turbine 1 comprises a<br>
turbine housing 4 which houses a turbine wheel 5. Similarly, the compressor 2<br>
comprises a compressor housing 6 which houses a compressor wheel 7. The turbine<br>
wheel 5 and compressor wheel 7 are mounted on opposite ends of a common shaft 8<br>
which is suppolted on bearing assemblies 9 within the bearing housing 3.<br>
The turbine housing 4 is provided with an exhaust gas inlet 10 and an exhaust<br>
gas outlet 11. The inlet 10 directs incoming exhaust gas to an annular inlet chamber<br>
12 which forms a volute surrounding the turbine wheel 5. The exhaust gas flows<br>
through the turoine 1 and into the outlet 1 1 via a circular outlet opening 13 which is<br>
co-axial with tl-e turbine wheel 5.<br>
The conlpressor comprises an inlet 14 and an outlet volute 15 co-axial with the<br>
compressor wheel 7. As the compressor wheel rotates, air intake is drawn in through<br>
the inlet 14, compressed and delivered to the engine via outlet volute 15. The<br>
illustrated compressor 2 has a map width enhanced (MWE) inlet structure comprising<br>
two co-axial tu5ular inlet sections 14a and 14b. The inner inlet section 14b is shorter<br>
than the outer mlet section 14a and has an inner surface which is an extension of a<br>
surface of the inner wall of the compressor housing which faces the compressor wheel<br>
7. The outer inlet portion 14a is located radially outside the inner inlet portion 14b to<br>
define an annular inlet passage 16 therebetween. Apertures 17 are formed through the<br>
housing at the downstream end of the outer inlet portion 14a and open into the inner<br>
surface of the compressor housing adjacent the compressor wheel 7. As the<br>
compressor wheel 7 rotates at high speed and flow conditions, intake air is drawn into<br>
the compressor housing through the inner inlet portion 14b and also through the<br>
annular passaze 16 and apertures 17. However, as the mass flow through the<br>
conlpressor whsel 7 falls the pressure drop across the apertures 17 falls and eventually<br>
reverses, at which time the airflow direction in the annular passage 16 also reverses<br>
such that some of the air entering the housing through the inner inlet portion 14b is recirculated.<br>
This stabilises the compressor performance in a well known way.<br>
Referring now to figure 2, this illustrates components of a conventional<br>
wastegate valve and wastegate actuator assembly which is not visible from figure 1.<br>
The turbine housing 4 is provided with a bypass passageway (not shown) which<br>
communicates between the exhaust inlet 10 and the exhaust outlet bypassing the<br>
turbine wheel. The bypass passageway communicates with the exhaust inlet 10 via a<br>
circular opening (not shown) which is opened and closed by a wastegate valve<br>
assembly 18 provided for controlling the flow therethrough. In figure 2 the part of the<br>
turbine housing 4 defining the inlet 10 is shown partially cut-away to reveal details of<br>
the wastegate valve assembly 18.<br>
The westegate valve assembly 18 is controlled by a pneumatic wastegate<br>
actuator 19 which is linked to the valve assembly 18 via a connecting rod 20. The<br>
actuator can 19 receives compressed air from the outlet of the compressor 2 via an<br>
airhose (not shown) communicating with a secondary boost av outlet passage (not<br>
shown) providzd through the compressing housing with the outlet volute fitted to<br>
nipple 21 and communicating with a port (not shown) provided in the compressor<br>
housing. The compressor can 19 is conventionally mounted to the outside of the<br>
compressor housing by an appropriate bracket (not shown). Details of the wastegate<br>
valve assembly 18, the actuator can 19, and the mounting arrangements for securing<br>
the actuator can 19 to the compressor are not important to an understanding of the<br>
present invention (and may be entirely conventional) and thus will not be described<br>
further.<br>
Figure 3 is a perspective, external illustration of a wastegated turbocharger<br>
fitted with a \;\,astegate command valve 22 and incorporating the present invention.<br>
Common reference numerals are used to identify components shown in figures 1 and<br>
2.<br>
Referring now to figure 4, this is an enlarged cross-section of part of the<br>
compressor housing of figure 3. The compressor housing, in this case the compressor<br>
cover 6a, is formed with a valve mounting boss 23 which defines an internal opening<br>
24 for receiving one end 22a of the command valve 22 (as illustrated the valve end<br>
22a is screwed into the boss 23 but other fixing arrangements may be provided to suit<br>
the form of valve 22).<br>
The co~npressor cover 6a is provided with three internal bores 25, 26 &amp; 27<br>
which communicate with the boss opening 24 and with respective ports of the<br>
command valvs 22. The first bore 25 is the secondary boost air outlet passage which<br>
communicates with the compressor outlet volute 15 to deliver boost air to the valve<br>
22. The second bore 26 is a boost air supply passage and opens to the outer surface of<br>
the compressor cover 6a and is provided to supply boost air from the valve 22 to the<br>
wastegate actuator via an appropriate hose connection shown by chain dot lines 28.<br>
The third bore 27 is a boost air vent passage and communicates with the compressor<br>
inlet in the region of the annular inlet passage 16.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the secondary boost air outlet<br>
passage 25 projects into the outlet volute 15 so that the opening 25a at the upstream<br>
end of the passage 25 is spaced from the surface 15a of the volute 15. The inventor<br>
has found that this seemingly simple expedient significantly reduces, and even<br>
entirely eliminates, the passage of oilldirt etc through the secondary boost passage 25.<br>
This is because any oilldirt particles etc are centrifuged onto the volute wall 15a by<br>
the gas flow which swirls through the outlet volute 15. Accordingly, air flowing<br>
through the volute away from the volute surface 15a is cleaner than the air flow close<br>
to the volute surface 15a.<br>
Each of'the bores 26 and 27 may be formed by drilling through the compressor<br>
cover 6a and boss 24. In the illustrated example the boost air vent bore 27 is formed<br>
from two angled portions which may be drilled separately from within the compressor<br>
inlet and boss opening 24 respectively. It will, however, be appreciated that. in other<br>
compressor housing designs it may be possible to provide a straight boost air vent<br>
bore between the command valve and the compressor inlet. Similarly, it will be<br>
understood that the bores 26 and 27 could be cast rather than drilled.<br>
The command valve 22 is a conventional three port proportional solenoid<br>
valve which is operable to selectively connect the boost air inlet bore 25 with either<br>
the boost air outlet bore 26 or boost air vent bore 27 in response to an appropriate<br>
control signal (received from the engine management system or other appropriate<br>
sensor/control arrangement). The valve 22 may thus be operated in essentially the<br>
same manner as a conventional wastegate actuator command valve to control the<br>
boost air supply to the wastegate actuator in accordance with normal operating<br>
parameters. Since the valve itself may be entirely conventional, no details of any<br>
particular valve will be described, but it should be borne in mind that the valve must<br>
be capable of withstanding the relatively high temperature generated at the<br>
compressor anti an appropriate valve should be selected accordingly.<br>
With tke simple embodiment illustrated in Figure 3, the projection into the<br>
volute 15 may be formed as an integral casting formation 6b with the compressor<br>
housing 6a. The bore 25 could either be cast or drilled post-casting. However,<br>
casting such a projection complicates the casting process and thus may add to<br>
manufacturing expense. One alternative is illustrated in Figure 5. The structure<br>
illustrated in Figure 5 is the same as that illustrated in Figure 3 except that the<br>
secondary boost air outlet passage is defined by a member 29 which is fitted into the<br>
boss opening 24 and extends through an aperture 30 which may simply be drilled into<br>
the housing 6a through the bottom of the opening 24. Figure 5 is only a schematic<br>
drawing, and i: will be appreciated that additional features, such as annular seals etc,<br>
may be provided to prevent gas leaking between the aperture 3 0 and member 29.<br>
Two further alternatives are illustrated in Figures 6 and 7. In each case the<br>
valve 22 is modified by provision of an elongate nose or stem 31 (which is directly<br>
equivalent to the projecting portion 6b of Figure 5) which extends through an aperture<br>
30 when the \,alve is installed in the valve mounting boss 23 (vent port 27 is not<br>
visible in Figures 6 and 7). Also shown in Figures 6 and 7 are O-ring seals 23a<br>
provided to provide an air-tight seal between the valve 22 and mounting boss 23.<br>
The embodiments of Figures 6 and 7 differ from one another in that in the<br>
embodiment ol'Figure 7 the aperture 30 is sized to receive only the nose portion 3 1 of<br>
the valve whereas with the embodiment of Figure 7 the aperture 30 is enlarged to<br>
receive a relatively large diameter end portion of the valve 22. The latter arrangement<br>
avoids the need for a separate drilling to form the aperture 30 which instead is formed<br>
by a drilling which defines a part of the boss opening 24.<br>
It will be appreciated that modification may be made to the detail of the<br>
configuration of the valve mounting boss dependent upon the design of the command<br>
valve intended to be used and to the size and positioning of the boost air inlet, outlet<br>
and vent bore:;, as well as the precise location at which these bores open to the<br>
compressor inlet, outlet and outer surface of the compressor housing.<br>
It will also be appreciated that the invention is not limited in application to any<br>
particular form of wastegate actuator or wastegate valve assembly but can be applied<br>
wherever a command valve is desirable to control operation of a pneumatic wastegate<br>
actuator. In addition, it will be understood that the command valve itself can be<br>
controlled in accordance with any conventional methods and engine performance<br>
parameters to provide the same control as a conventional wastegate actuator<br>
command valve.<br>
Valves intended for other purposes may be installed and that the invention is<br>
not limited for use in application with wastegate actuator command valves. For<br>
instance, a valve operated to prevent compressor surge may be installed as suggested<br>
by the Japanese patent application mentioned in the introduction to this specification.<br>
Furtherniore, it should be appreciated that the present invention provides<br>
advantages even where the valve is located remote from the secondary boost air outlet<br>
passage. For -nstance, Figure 8 schematically illustrates an adapter member 32<br>
installed in an aperture 34 provided through a compressor housing 6. One end of the<br>
adapter 32 defines a secondary boost air outlet passage 33 which projects into the<br>
compressor vollste 15, and the other end of the adapter 32 provides a fitting 34 for<br>
attachment of xi air hose (not shown) for feeding the boost air to a remotely located<br>
valve. The adapter 32 is preferably screwed into the aperture 34, and in order to<br>
provide sufficiently long screw thread the compressor housing 6 is preferably formed<br>
with a boss 35 tlhrough which the aperture 34 is drilled.<br>
Furthemlore, the air need not necessarily be supplied to a downstream valve<br>
but could, for instance, be supplied directly to a wastegate actuator or other<br>
component.<br>
Other modifications and applications of the invention will be readily apparent<br>
to the appropriately skilled person.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
