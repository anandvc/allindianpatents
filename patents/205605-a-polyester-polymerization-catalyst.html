SPECIFICATION<br>
TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
A POLYESTER POLYMERIZATION CATALYST, POLYESTER PRODUCED<br>
BY USING THE SAME, AND A PROCESS FOR PRODUCING<br>
POLYESTER<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a polyester polymerization catalyst, polyester produced by using the same and a process for producing polyester and in particular to an antimony compound-free novel polyester polymerization catalyst, polyester produced by using the same and a process for producing polyester. Prior Art<br>
Polyester, particularly polyethylene terephthalate (abbreviated hereinafter into PET), is superior in mechanical and chemical properties and applied to various uses such as fibers for clothes and industrial materials, various films such as packaging films and magnetic tapes and sheets, and molded articles such as bottles and engineering plastics.<br>
PET is obtained industrially by esterification or transesterification of terephthalic acid or dimethyl terephthalate with ethylene glycol thereof to produce bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate and subsequent polycondensation thereof with a catalyst at high temperature in vacuo.   As the catalyst used in this polycondensation, antimony trioxide is widely used.   Antimony<br><br>
trioxide is a catalyst which is inexpensive and superior in the catalytic activity, but since an antimony metal is precipitated during polycondensation, there is the problem of gray discoloration and formation of insoluble particles in PET.   Further, a problem with the safety of antimony is recently noted from an environmental viewpoint.    Under these circumstances, there is demand for polyester containing no or httle antimony.<br>
While using antimony trioxide as the polycondensation catalyst, an attempt at inhibiting occurrence of gray discoloration and formation of insoluble particles in PET has been made.   In Japanese Patent No. 2666502, for example, antimony trioxide and bismuth and selenium compounds are used as the polycondensation catalyst, whereby formation of gray insoluble particles in PET is inhibited.   Further, Japanese Unexamined Patent Pubhcation No. 291141/1997 describes that when antimony trioxide containing sodium and iron oxides is used as the polycondensation catalyst, precipitation of an antimony metal is inhibited. However, these polycondensation catalysts cannot achieve the object of obtaining polyester containing no or little antimony.<br>
A polycondensation catalyst substituted for antimony trioxide has also been investigated.   In particular, a titanium compound represented by tetraalkoxy titanate has already been proposed, but there is the problem that PET produced using this compound is significantly discolored and easily thermally degraded.<br>
As an attempt to overcome such problem when tetraalkoxy titanate is used as the polycondensation catalyst, for example Japanese Unexamined<br><br>
Patent Publication No. 116722/1980 has proposed a method of using tetraalkoxy titanate with a cobalt salt and a calcium salt.   Further, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 73581/1996 has proposed a method of using tetraalkoxy titanate simultaneously with a cobalt compound as the polycondensation catalyst and simultaneously using a optical brightener.    By these proposes, the discoloration of PET is reduced when tetraalkoxy titanate is used as the polycondensation catalyst, but effective inhibition of thermal degradation of PET has not been achieved.<br>
As a polycondensation catalyst which is substituted for antimony trioxide and overcomes such problem when tetraalkoxy titanate is used, a germanium compound has been practically used, but this catalyst has the problem that it is very expensive and that the catalyst easily evaporates from the reaction system to the outside so that the concentration of the catalyst in the reaction system is changed thus making control of polymerization difficult.<br>
It is known that aluminum compounds are generally inferior in the catalytic activity.   Among the aluminum compounds, aluminum chelate compounds are reported to have a higher catalytic activity as a polycondensation catalyst than other aluminum compounds, but the catalytic activity is not practically sufficient as compared with the antimony compounds and titanium compounds described above.<br>
This invention provides a novel polycondensation catalyst other than antimony compounds, polyester produced by using the same and a process for producing polyester.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present inventors made extensive examination for solving the problems described above, and as a result, they surprisingly found that as a polycondensation catalyst, an aluminum compound, though being originally inferior in the catalytic activity, came to have a sufficient activity by allowing a phosphorus compound to be coexistent therewith, thus arriving at this invention.    When the polycondensation catalyst of this invention is used, polyester superior in quahties can be obtained without using the antimony compound.<br>
That is, this invention provides a polyester polymerization catalyst, which comprises an aluminum compound and a phosphorus compound, polyester produced by using the same and a process for producing polyester, as a method of solving the problems above.<br>

Further, a mixture prepared by previously mixing the two or more compounds with alkali metals or compounds thereof or alkaline earth metals or compounds thereof may be added, or these compounds may be added separately.<br>

The antimony compound is added more preferably in an amount of 30 ppm or less.   Addition of antimony in an amount of more than 50 ppm is not preferable because an antimony metal is precipitated resulting in the gray discoloration and formation of insoluble particles in the polyester.   The germanium compound is added preferably in an amount of 20 ppm or less (in terms of germanium atom) in the polyester obtained by polymerization.

Hereinafter, this invention is described in more detail by reference to the Examples, which however are not intended to limit this invention. The intrinsic viscosity (IV) of polyester in each of the Examples and Comparative Examples was measured at a temperature of 30 °C in a 6/4 mixed solvent (ratio by weight) of phenol/,l,2,2-tetrachloroethane. Example 1<br>
As the catalyst, 3 g/l aluminum chloride in ethylene glycol was added, in an amount of 0.015 mole % in terms of aluminum relative to the acid component in polyester, to bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate, and then dimethyl phenylphosphonate was added in an amount of 0.02 mole % relative to the acid component in polyester, and the mixture was stirred at 245°C for 10 minutes at atmospheric pressure.    Then, the mixture was heated over 50 minutes to 275 °C, during which the pressure in the reaction system was gradually reduced to 0.1 mmHg, and further polycondensation reaction was conducted for 3 hours at the same temperature and at the same pressure.   The intrinsic viscosity of the resulting polymer is shown in Table 1. Examples 2 to 7 and Comparative Examples 1 to 2<br>
Polyester was polymerized in the same manner as in Example 1<br><br>
except that the catalyst was changed.   The intrinsic viscosity of the resulting polymer is shown in Table 1.<br><br><br>
According to this invention, there is provided a novel polycondensation catalyst other than antimony compounds as well as polyester produced by using the same.    The polyester of this invention can be apphed to fibers for clothes, fibers for industrial materials, various films, sheets and molded articles such as bottles and engineering plastics, as well as coatings and adhesives.<br><br><br><br>
