				<td>Field of the Invention;-<br>
The present invention relates to a apparatus for testing a structural specimen made up of concrete or steel subject to combined bending and torsion. Description to prior Art:-<br>
The presence of loading which produces simultaneous bending and torsion in a member means that some degree of Interaction between the two effects will occur. In case of bending plus torsion, the angle of twist (0) caused by the torsion is amplified by the bending moment, inducing additional warping moment and torsional shear.<br>
EP1087278 disclose method of generating control data for bending and torsion apparatus. The proposal for software program such as Numerical control program was given for collecting data and transferring to the processor and computer for analysis.<br>
US Pat No.4722223 dealing with Vibration testing of panel products, the method of panel support restricts the measurement to a single panel property, namely the modulus of elasticity from the single impact that produces panel vibration.<br>
DE 37 16 215 Al reveals a rotating bending test equipment also Torsion loading mechanism for introducing a circulating bending moment and a torsion loading into a test specimen.<br>
JP 2004150976 A reveals load test equipment for a torsion bending and axle load. JP 200227392 A reveals a combined torsion bending strain test machine. JP 7260652 A reveals a static's load tester.<br>
JP 61014541 A reveals Torsions and bending test machine.<br>
From the JP 4232441 it is actually well-known to bring to the production of a torsion vibration a sample at their two ends by means of electric motors in rotation and to detect the angles of rotation of the engines over function givers. Devices of this kind, with which the two electric motors with different number of revolutions, coupled at in each case an end of the sample, are operated, are particularly suitable for examining wires.<br>
From the EP 0,410,370 a device is well-known, with which a sample at in each case an end is shiftable by means of an electric motor in turn, whereby the rotating motion of an electric motor, which is coupled with an end of the sample, can by means of a blocking device be blocked and suddenly again released.<br>
The prior Art concerning complex bending and torsional effects and the theory applicable to torsional vibration are known to be applicable to rod like material of circular or rectangular cross section, but it has not been known to be applicable to rolled steel sections and products of different shapes, also it should be pointed out that the combined bending and torsion technique in the prior art requires multiple impacts and sensors to generate, capture and separate the two types of signals.<br>

Detailed Description of preferred Embodiment:-<br>
These are illustrated in figs 1, 2, 3 and 4 apparatus provided by the present invention for testing specimens, or RSJ. The apparatus is adopted for testing the structural specimens i.e. beam made up on Rolled steel Joists, channels, concrete and composite material subjected to combined bending and torsional effects referring to figs 1 to 3. The apparatus includes a rigid frame 1 that includes vertical posts (a, b) horizontally-spaced apart interconnected by horizontal member. Posts are rigidly fixed on the<br>
integrated strong floor with extended floor system, with nut and bolt arrangement at bottom and connected with plate Girder of sufficient strength at top.<br>
At least two hydraulic actuators (5) with rolling and fixture system are running on the horizontal beam.<br>
A mild steel loading frame 2 (a, b) is used to support the structural specimen according to different end conditions.<br>
The loading arm is rigidly attached to free end of the beam. It has a movable collar (3, 3') allowing both the bending and the combined bending and torsion to be examined.<br>
At least two digital displacement indicators (4,4') gages are fixed to the loading arm.<br>
As the beam deflects the gage moves with the beam and displacement from the reference frame is indicated. These gages are used to measure both deflection (h) and angle of twist (0) at the end of the beam as shown.<br>
At least two rosette strain gages are mounted in 45° orientation along the longitudinal axis of the beam. The strain indicator box (11) allows the rosette strains to be read digitally.<br>
The strain indicator box houses the register (R3), the variables register (R4) power supply and the galvanometer. The bridge can be balanced by adjusting R4. For rosette, the gage factor is 2.03 ± 1.00%<br>
The structural specimen RSJ or other structural specimen are position in the apparatus i.e. for simply supported end condition fixed at one grip and rolling on other side attached with torsional lever arm to produce torsional moment in the specimen,<br>
similarly both end fixed and cantilever end condition are maintained. Hydraulic actuators are positioned on the top surface of the structural element to produce bending effects. At least two rosettes are mounted on top, two on bottom just opposite to loading and two on the vertical side for studying the twist strain as per study conditions. All the rosette strain gages are attached with strain indicator box. The bridge can be balanced by adjusting R4.<br>
Introduce loading through actuator and required torsional moments are produced in the specimen from end through ball bearing with lever arm attachment for torsional moment. Note down the different angle of twist for different drift and strain at different loading condition so as to study the failure criteria. Graph between stress Vs strain should be produced for different loading. These displacement charts for flexural and torsional hysters are used to find out the reliability of that structural element. These charts help in design of a structure so that for a particular rate of reliability maximum capacity of the specimen was fixed. Or the structured elements should be designed for the particular amount of reliability and particular loading condition as per field requirements.<br><br><br>
