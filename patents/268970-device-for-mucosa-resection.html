"Device for Mucosa Resection"<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a device for mucosa resection, in particular by means of endoscopic methods.<br>
To treat gastrointestinal carcinomas, mucosa resections must be carried out that are usually conducted by means of endoscopic methods. Changes to the tissue are marked (dyed) upon recognition and then injected underneath with a physiological saline solution. This lifts the mucosa from the underlying layer, the muscularis. As a result, a sufficiently safe distance from the muscularis can be achieved and thus possible perforation can be avoided. The removal of the damaged mucosa can occur by means of various techniques, e.g. by snares or by IT knife. In all cases, however, it is extremely desirable to guarantee a specific, spatially restricted lifting of the mucosa and a correspondingly specific and spatially restricted separation, which is usually associated with considerable surgical effort, requiring great skill and experience on the part of the surgeon.<br>
In particular it causes considerable problems to puncture the submucosa initially with a (flexible) needle and inject a desired (small) amount of fluid to lift the mucosa. The puncture depth, the dosage and thus the form of lifting are dependent on the operating personnel. Once the mucosa has been lifted, its separation must occur, wherein the time following the injection and the lifting of the mucosa play an essential part, since the injected fluid escapes from the submucosa and the lifting achieved consequently recede until no further separation of the damaged tissue is possible. In such cases, a new injection must be given and the attempt made again to carry out the desired separation. Particularly when a tumour lies behind a fold, a snare cannot be placed or fixed quickly enough around the lesion.<br><br>
The object of the invention is to provide a device for mucosa resection, by means of which mucosal tissue can be safely removed in a simple manner.<br>
This object is achieved by a device according to patent claim 1.<br>
In particular the object is achieved by a device for endoscopic mucosa resection, comprising a facility for endoscopic water-jet surgery with a control device for regulating the pressure at which a water jet is discharged from a nozzle to obtain a predetermined amount of energy, and with an adjusting means for setting the pressure to a first value, at which the water jet penetrates the mucosa in such a way that it is lifted from the underlying muscularis through the formation of a fluid deposit, and to a second value, different from the first value, at which the mucosa is sectionally cut through by the water jet.<br>
Thus, both the injection to lift the mucosa and the severing of the tissue are effected by means of a single instrument and, indeed, merely by a suitable adjustment of the pressure.<br>
A further advantage of the device according to the invention is that, as a result of the severing, at least part of the fluid effecting the separation replaces fluid escaping from the deposit and thus achieves the lifting.<br>
Preferably, the adjusting means is configured in such a way that a predetermined amount of fluid is discharged upon setting the pressure to the first value and actuating a first starting switch. This enables a very simple and precise dosage of the amount of fluid to occur, which lifts the mucosa.<br>
The adjusting means is further preferably configured in such a way that, upon setting the pressure to a second value and actuating a second starting switch, the fluid is discharged in an essentially continuous manner while the second starting switch is operated. This hands the cutting of the tissue completely over to the surgeon.<br>
The adjusting means is further preferably configured in such a way that the first pressure can be adjusted independently of the second pressure. As a result, the pressure required to lift the mucosa and the pressure required to cut it can be adapted in each case to the physiological circumstances.<br><br>
It is also possible to equip the adjusting means with a ratio setting mechanism, which permits a predetermined ratio of the first pressure to be set in relation to the second. In particular, when a peak pressure setting mechanism is provided, a quick adjustment to changing tissue conditions can be made.<br>
The second pressure can preferably be adjusted in several stages to adapt to different tissue types, guaranteeing easy operability through the choice of few values. The pressures in the different stages can preferably be adjusted independently of each other, which in turn facilitates the handling during an operation.<br>
Preferably a display mechanism is provided to indicate different operating modes, in particular in relation to a currently set pressure value or also a previously set pressure value for lifting or cutting through the mucosa, so that the surgeon can easily see the values he has so far been operating with or the values that are currently set.<br>
To operate the device, a foot switch is preferably provided for optional setting of the first or second pressure, that is, for switching between injecting and cutting. In this case, it is also possible to work with a single starting switch that will trigger the particular operation (injection/separation).<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention emerge from the sub-claims.<br>
Below, an embodiment example of the invention is described with reference to a drawing which depicts a device according to the invention in a schematic representation.<br>
As shown in the drawing, a conventional water-jet facility 10 is provided. Water (physiological saline solution) from a probe 12, which can be introduced into the working channel of an endoscope, is supplied via a supply line 11. The water jet issues from a nozzle 13 at the distal end of the probe 12.<br>
To control the water-jet facility 10 an adjusting means 20 is provided which is equipped with various setting mechanisms. In particular, a first pressure setting mechanism 23 and a second pressure setting mechanism 24 are provided here for pre-selecting the first or second pressure. The ratio of the first to the second pressure can be set by means of a setting mechanism 25 and the peak pressure can be set by means of a mechanism 26. These pressure settings are not all independent of each other, the result being that setting<br><br>
occurs either by the setting mechanisms 23 and 24 or by setting of the mechanisms 25, 26.<br>
In both cases, the injection duration upon application of the first pressure is set by means of a setting mechanism 28.<br>
A foot switch 27 is provided for actuation, which has a first starting switch 21 and a second starting switch 22. Depending on which of the two starting switches 21 or 22 is actuated, the device operates using the first or second pressure. It is also possible, of course, to configure the foot switch 27 in such a way that it only selects the pressure, while the starting signal is given by another switch, e.g. a hand-operated switch. It is likewise possible to provide appropriate hand switches instead of a foot switch.<br>
Finally, the adjusting means 20 has further display mechanisms 30 and 31 for indicating the first or second pressure, wherein these display mechanisms are configured in such a way that rapid monitoring to determine which of the two pressures is set is as much facilitated as exact monitoring of the set pressure (as the measured value).<br>
In one alternative embodiment of the invention not depicted in the figure, a means is provided for allowing the water jet with the first pressure to issue from a different noz2le 13 to the water jet with the second pressure. As a result it is possible to select variably not only the jet diameter but also the jet direction, depending on whether tissue is to be injected or separated.<br>
