The present invention relates to a method for producing light-amplifying optical<br>
material, said method comprising at least atomizing at least one reactant in<br>
liquid form by an atomizing gas to form droplets, introducing said droplets and/<br>
or their vaporous products into a flame, oxidizing said at least one reactant to<br>
form one or more, condensing said one or more oxides to produce particles,<br>
collecting at least a part of said particles, and fusing said particles together to<br>
form said light-amplifying optical material. The present invention relates also<br>
to a device for producing said light-amplifying optical material and to an optical<br>
waveguide comprising said light-amplifying optical material.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Generation of small particles is an important step in the production of light-<br>
amplifying optical waveguides, which amplify light by stimulated emission of<br>
radiation. The light-amplifying properties of those waveguides are achieved by<br>
doping, for example, amorphous quartz glass with suitable dopants, for<br>
example with erbium.<br>
Doped quartz glass can be produced by generating small particles by<br>
synthesis in a flame. US Patent 6,565,823 discloses a method and an<br>
apparatus for forming fused silica by combustion of liquid reactants. Liquid<br>
siloxane feedstock is delivered as a liquid solution to a conversion site, which<br>
may be, for example, a methane-oxygen flame. The feedstock is atomized<br>
with the assistance of a gas to form a dispersion of liquid droplets. The<br>
droplets are evaporated and the siloxane is decomposed and oxidized in the<br>
flame to form supersaturated silica vapor. The saturated vapor pressure of<br>
silica is low even at the high temperatures of the flame. Consequently, the<br>
supersaturated vapor is rapidly nucleated and condensed generating a<br>
number of small silica particles. The particles are collected on a mandrel to<br>
form a waveguide preform. A waveguide is subsequently produced from the<br>
preform by a process comprising heating and drawing.<br>
Due to differences in the saturated vapor pressures of required reactants, it<br>
may be advantageous to introduce reactants with low saturated vapor<br>
pressure into the flame as atomized liquid droplets. The process of forming<br><br>
small droplets by aerodynamic and/or shear forces caused by a gas stream<br>
acting on a liquid surface is called atomization.<br>
It is a known fact in the area of atomization, that small liquid droplets may be<br>
produced using a high velocity of the atomizing gas. However, it is known in<br>
the area of producing light-amplifying materials, that it is critical for the optical<br>
and mechanical properties of the material, that the properties of the produced<br>
material particles are as homogeneous as possible. Consequently, particles<br>
are typically synthetized in a flame, which does not exhibit large spatial and<br>
temporal variations of temperature and local gas composition. Therefore the<br>
tendency has been to minimize the turbulence of the flame in order to achieve<br>
a reaction zone, which is spatially and temporally uniform and preferably<br>
laminar. It is known that high gas velocities induce turbulence, which in turn is<br>
associated with chaotic spatial and temporal variations of temperature and<br>
local gas composition. The requirement to obtain well-controlled uniform<br>
properties of the flame has set a limit to the velocity of the atomizing gas.<br>
Another aspect is that a long residence time in the flame is known to favor<br>
complete evaporation of the droplets and to ensure reaction times, which are<br>
long enough for oxidation and the formation of desired compounds. It is known<br>
that the residence times are proportional to the length of the flame and<br>
inversely proportional to the velocity of the gas or the droplets.<br>
US Patent 6,565,823 teaches that in a most preferred embodiment high<br>
velocity gas is utilized in atomizing a liquid feedstock, which gas produces<br>
atomized liquid projections with a velocity in the range of 0,5 to 50 m/s.<br>
Further, using a gas flow rate and minimum diameter values indicated on<br>
column 10, lines 1 to 11 of said patent, a velocity in the order of 50 m/s can be<br>
calculated for said atomizing high velocity gas.<br>
Patent application PCT/FI99/00818 teaches in a similar fashion, that for<br>
effective atomization, it is preferable to make the velocity of the spraying gas<br>
as high as possible. However, no numerical values are given for said velocity.<br>
US Patent 6,672,106 discloses a modification of the system described in the<br>
US Patent 6,565,823. The US Patent 6,672,106 teaches that by using said<br><br>
modification and by using oxygen as the atomizing gas, the velocity of the<br>
atomizing gas stream can be reduced by at least 50%.<br>
In addition, the US Patent 6,672,106 teaches that by using lower atomizing<br>
gas velocities, turbulence is reduced at the reaction zone, and thus the<br>
particle deposition rate is greatly improved. A reduction in gas velocity is also<br>
taught to reduce so called blank defects, which are detrimental to the optical<br>
and mechanical properties of the produced waveguides.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to produce light-amplifying optical<br>
material with homogenous composition and small size. It is a further object of<br>
the present invention to achieve improved control of the process used in the<br>
production of said material.<br>
To attain these objects, the method and the device according to the present<br>
invention is mainly characterized in that atomizing gas atomizing a reactant in<br>
liquid form is discharged at a velocity, which is in the range of 0.3 to 1.5 times<br>
the velocity of sound. The light-amplifying optical waveguide according to the<br>
present invention is mainly characterized in that atomizing gas is discharged<br>
at a velocity, which is in the range of 0.3 to 1.5 times the velocity of sound,<br>
and that the concentration of clustered erbium ions in produced light-<br>
amplifying optical waveguide material is smaller than the square of the<br>
concentration of all erbium ions in said light-amplifying optical waveguide<br>
multiplied by a factor 6 x 1027 m3. Other preferred embodiments of the<br>
invention are described in the dependent claims.<br>
According to the present invention, homogeneous particles suitable for<br>
producing optical waveguides are achieved by maximizing turbulence in the<br>
flame. Thus, the approach according to the present invention is different from<br>
the approach used in the prior art.<br>
The flame becomes highly turbulent and the rates of mixing, heating and<br>
cooling are greatly enhanced. Thanks to efficient mixing, the generation of<br><br>
heat, the reactions and the condensation of the particles take place fast and<br>
essentially in the same volume within the flame, which improves the control of<br>
the particle production process.<br>
By applying a high velocity of the atomizing gas several advantageous effects<br>
take place: The average size of the atomized droplets becomes small thanks<br>
to the high velocity of the atomizing gas. The atomized droplets are rapidly<br>
transferred to the flame. The high velocity of the atomizing gas enhances<br>
turbulence and mixing of the reactants in the flame. Thanks to effective mixing<br>
the reaction rates are high. The high rate of combustion leads to high<br>
combustion temperature, which further accelerates the rates of oxidation and<br>
doping reactions and accelerates gas velocity in the flame. Thanks to the high<br>
temperature and small droplet size, the droplets are evaporated rapidly in the<br>
flame. The dimensions of the flame are shrunk thanks to the high reaction<br>
rates. Turbulence enhances also mixing of cold gas to the reaction gases<br>
reducing the effective residence times even further. Thanks to the high gas<br>
velocity and small dimensions, the residence time of the substances in the<br>
flame are reduced. The low residence times reduce the agglomeration of the<br>
droplets and the produced particles.<br>
the turbulent flame is not sensitive to disturbances. Therefore the production<br>
capacity of the device and the method according to the present invention can<br>
be scaled up by arranging several devices to operate adjacent to each other.<br>
The residence time of the reaction products in the flame is short. Thus<br>
particles comprising nonequilibrium chemical products can be produced. For<br>
example, the separation of different phases in the produced material and the<br>
undesired clustering of erbium ions are minimized, which improves the<br>
homogeneity of the produced particles.<br>
This is advantageous especially in the production of particles suitable for<br>
manufacturing of light-amplifying optical waveguides. For example, in case of<br>
doping with erbium, the aim is to have single and isolated erbium ions in the<br>
material. Clustered forms of erbium are not effective in the amplification of<br>
light. Erbium has a tendency to form Er2O3 in the gas phase, if sufficient time<br>
is available to reach thermodynamical equilibrium. In an AI-Si-O system<br><br>
erbium has a tendency to form AI5Er3O12-Al2O3, respectively. According to the<br>
invention, the formation of the erbium ion clusters can be minimized by limiting<br>
the residence time of the particles in the flame, which is achieved by applying<br>
the high velocity of the atomizing gas.<br>
Because the clustering of the active ions is substantially minimized, it is<br>
possible to increase the concentration of said ions in the produced light-<br>
amplifying material, which consequently leads to high quantum conversion<br>
efficiency. Thus, erbium-doped optical waveguide produced according to the<br>
present invention has excellent light-amplifying characteristics. For example,<br>
an Er-doped fiber produced according to the present invention was found to<br>
provide a quantum conversion efficiency of 65%.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The device for making light-amplifying optical material comprises at least a<br>
burner assembly, which is used for producing particles of erbium -doped silica<br>
glass.<br>
Referring to Figs. 1a and 1b, the burner assembly 600 comprises four tubes<br>
11, 21, 31, 41, which define four concentric nozzles12, 22, 32, 42. The<br>
innermost nozzle, herein called as the liquid nozzle, is used for delivering<br>
liquid reactant 10. The outer surface of the tube 11 and the inner surface of<br>
the tube 21 define together an annular atomizing gas nozzle 22, from which<br>
an atomizing gas 20 is discharged. The atomizing gas is accelerated by a<br>
pressure difference prevailing over the nozzle 22. The velocity of the<br>
atomizing gas 20 may be further accelerated by the constriction 24 of the<br>
nozzle 22. Instead of the constriction 24 of the tube 21, the cross-section may<br>
also be reduced by implementing an enlargement of the outer surface of the<br>
liquid reactant tube 11. The burner assembly 600 may also comprise more<br>
nozzles than depicted in Fig. 1a, for example to deliver inert gas.<br><br>
Referring to Fig. 2, there is a liquid surface 14 at the liquid nozzle 12. Shear<br>
and aerodynamic forces generated by the stream of the atomizing gas 20 tear<br>
droplets 15 from the liquid surface 14 causing atomization. The droplets may<br>
be further fragmented by turbulence. The droplets are entrained within the gas<br>
jet and accelerated to a high velocity and further entrained into the flame 100.<br>
The reactants delivered by the nozzles 12, 22, 32, 42 are mixed by turbulence<br>
and by diffusion. Exothermic reactions of the reactants, especially the<br>
oxidation of hydrogen provides the heat required for the flame 100. A high<br>
temperature is achieved. The origin of the flame 100 is associated with a<br>
position in which the velocity of the flame propagation with respect to the<br>
gases is substantially equal to the velocity of the gases.<br>
Due to extensive dilution with surrounding gases, the atomized droplets 15<br>
start to evaporate after atomization. The rate of evaporation is greatly<br>
enhanced after mixing with the hot combustion gases in the flame 100. The<br>
reactants 10, 20, 30 react and oxidize in the flame 100 by producing oxides<br>
and other compounds. The saturated vapor pressures of silicon oxide (silica)<br>
and erbium oxides are so low that they are rapidly nucleated and condensed<br>
forming doped silica particles 50. The condensation is further promoted by the<br>
turbulent mixing of surrounding cool gas with the hot reaction gases, which<br>
rapidly decreases the average temperature of the gases.<br>
Preferably, the velocity of the atomizing gas 20 near the liquid surface 14 is in<br>
the range of 0.3 to 1.5 times the velocity of sound. The most preferred velocity<br>
of the atomizing gas is substantially equal to the velocity of sound.<br>
The velocity of sound Vs is given by the equation:<br><br>
in which p denotes gas pressure, p denotes gas density and the constant y is<br>
given by:<br><br><br>
in which cp denotes the heat capacity of the gas at constant pressure and cv<br>
denotes the heat capacity of the gas at constant volume. The velocity of<br>
sound Vs depends on the gas temperature and on the type of the gas.<br>
The Reynolds number ReD corresponding to a velocity V is defined as:<br><br>
in which D is the outer diameter of the liquid nozzle 12 and v is the kinematic<br>
viscosity of the atomizing gas at the exit end of the atomizing gas nozzle 22.<br>
It is known that a high Reynolds number promotes turbulence. In order to<br>
achieve small droplets 15, it is advantageous to select a small diameter of the<br>
liquid nozzle 12, which according to the equation (3) requires a high velocity V<br>
of the atomizing gas 20.<br>
A pressure ratio R is defined as:<br><br>
in which p is the static pressure of the atomizing gas 20 inside the atomizing<br>
gas nozzle 22 and pa is the static pressure outside the atomizing gas nozzle. It<br>
is known that a substantially sonic velocity, i.e. the velocity of sound may be<br>
reached when the pressure ratio R prevailing over the constriction 24 (Fig. 1)<br>
has a value in the order of two.<br>
Only velocities up to the velocity of sound can be implemented using nozzles<br>
with constant cross section or with converging cross-section. The<br>
implementation of the velocities higher than the velocity of sound requires<br>
diverging nozzles.<br><br>
In order to produce erbium-doped silica material, the liquid reactant delivered<br>
by the nozzle 12 is preferably erbium chloride and aluminum chloride<br>
dissolved in methanol. The atomizing gas delivered by the atomizing gas<br>
nozzle 22 is hydrogen. Silicon tetrachloride is delivered by the annular nozzle<br>
32 (Fig. 1) and oxygen is delivered by the annular nozzle 42 (Fig. 1). The role<br>
of aluminum chloride is to improve the solubility of erbium in the produced<br>
silica glass.<br>
Further, the applicable flow rates in the production of erbium-doped silica are<br>
as follows:<br>
-	Liquid flow rate through the liquid nozzle 12: 3,6 to 4,5 g/min.<br>
-	Gas flow rate through the atomizing gas nozzle 22: 35 to 60 SLPM.<br>
-	Gas flow rate through the nozzle 32: 0 to 15 SLPM.<br>
-	Gas flow rate through the nozzle 42:10 to 40 SLPM.<br>
SLPM denotes standard liter per minute.<br>
In the production of erbium-doped silica, the applicable diameters of the<br>
nozzles 12, 22 are substantially in the order of a millimeter.<br>
The optimum combination of the flow rates of the reactants 10, 20, 30, 40, the<br>
composition of the reactants 10, 20, 30, 40, and the dimensions of the nozzles<br>
12, 22, 32, 42 should be optimized according to the predetermined target<br>
properties of the light-amplifying optical material. For example, the<br>
predetermined target concentration of erbium ions may be set to correspond<br>
an absorption of 10dB/m, 20dB/m or a further predetermined value. The<br>
preferred approach is that the optimum flow rates, compositions and<br>
dimensions are determined by an experimental procedure known by a person<br>
skilled in the art. It is emphasized that a determined approach to apply an<br>
atomizing gas velocity in the order of the velocity of sound is required.<br>
Typically, a set of experiments has to be carried out, i.e. a single test using a<br>
high atomization gas velocity is not likely to provide the optimum parameters.<br>
In general, in order to achieve desired light-amplifying properties of the end-<br>
product, the liquid reactant 10 may comprise a compound which may<br>
comprise at least one metal selected from the groups IA, IB IIA, IIB MIA, IIIB,<br>
IVA, IVB, VA, and the rare earth series of the periodic table of elements.<br><br>
Especially, the liquid reactant 10 may comprise erbium, ytterbium, neodymium<br>
and/or thulium. Silica-forming compounds may also be introduced in liquid<br>
form, for example by introducing siloxane. In some applications, one of the<br>
reactants may be clean room air. The atomizing gas 20 may be a premixed<br>
mixture of a combustible gas and an oxidizing gas, especially a premixed<br>
mixture of hydrogen and oxygen.<br>
The flow rate of the liquid reactant 10 is controlled by a metering pump. The<br>
flow of the liquid reactant 10 may be partially assisted by a venturi effect<br>
generated by the atomizing gas stream 20. The flow rates of the atomizing<br>
gas and the gaseous reactants 20, 30, 40 are controlled by thermal mass flow<br>
controllers. Silicon tetrachloride is introduced to the reactant 30 using a gas<br>
bubbler.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3a, a device 1000 for producing optical waveguide preform<br>
comprises a burner assembly 600, a rotating mandrel 710 and a manipulator<br>
800 to rotate and move the mandrel 710 with respect to the burner assembly<br>
600. The doped glass particles are synthetized in the flame 100 and collected<br>
on the mandrel 710 to form a preform 720. Also additional glass material may<br>
be collected on the preform to provide material for the cladding of optical<br>
waveguide to be produced.<br>
The mandrel is removed, and the preform 710 is subsequently inserted into a<br>
furnace (not shown) for purification and sintering. Referring to Fig. 3b, the<br>
preform is finally heated and drawn to form an optical waveguide 750, using<br>
methods and devices known by a person skilled in the art of optical fiber<br>
production.<br>
At least a light-amplifying optical fiber with the following parameters can be<br>
produced by a method according to the present invention:<br>
-	Peak absorption 20 dB/m measured at the wavelength of 1530 nm.<br>
-	Core diameter 6 micrometers and cladding diameter 125 micrometers.<br>
-	The percentage of erbium ions in clusters in the core material being in the<br>
order of 6,5 %<br><br>
The percentage of erbium ions in clusters can be determined on the basis of<br>
the ratio of the spectral transmittance of the optical material measured using a<br>
high intensity light source and the spectral transmittance of the optical material<br>
measured using a low intensity light source. The measurements are made at<br>
the wavelength of 978 nm.<br>
The concentration of clustered erbium ions can also be expressed in a more<br>
general way. The percentage of erbium ions in clusters has been found to<br>
depend on the concentration of all erbium ions in the produced light-amplifying<br>
material. It has been experimentally found, that the percentage of erbium<br>
clusters in the light-amplifying optical material produced according to the<br>
present invention is typically equal or smaller than the concentration of erbium<br>
ions times a factor 4.85 x 1025 m3. Thus, allowing a typical error margin of<br>
20%, the obtainable concentration of clustered erbium ions in produced light-<br>
amplifying optical waveguide material is smaller than the square of the<br>
concentration of all erbium ions in said light-amplifying optical waveguide<br>
multiplied by a factor 6 x 1027 m3.<br>
During the operation, either the substrate 200 and/or the burner assembly 600<br>
may be moved in linear, curved or rotational manner to collect the produced<br>
particles 50. The collection of the produced particles 50 is mainly based on<br>
thermoforesis. However, also the principles of inertial impaction or collection<br>
by electrostatic forces may be applied for collecting the produced particles 50.<br>
The device may be contained within an enclosure to maintain high purity of<br>
the generated product.<br>
The device 1000 may also be used to produce and collect light-amplifying<br>
material on a planar surface, such as the substrate 200 shown in Fig. 2 to<br>
form a planar, i.e. a substantially two-dimensional waveguide structure.<br>
A plurality of tubes and or longitudinal rods comprising light-amplifying<br>
material may be arranged adjacent next to each other to be heated and drawn<br>
to form a so-called photonic optical structure.<br>
An optical component comprising said light-amplifying material may be<br>
produced. For example, a light-amplifying rod may be produced by fusing,<br><br>
grinding and polishing processes to be used as a mounted or freestanding<br>
component in a laser device.<br>
Fig. 4 is a flow chart of the method according to the present invention. The<br>
liquid reactant 10 is atomized 410 to droplets 50 in an atomizing step 410<br>
using the atomizing gas 20. The droplets 50 experience evaporation in an<br>
evaporation step 420 in the flame 100 and also prior to the introduction into<br>
the flame 100 (Fig. 2). The evaporation products, the other gaseous reactants<br>
30 and the oxidizing gas 40 is mixed to the gases causing oxidation in an<br>
oxidizing step 440. Doping reactions take place in a doping reaction step 450.<br>
Oxidation liberates heat 110, which sustains the temperature of the flame 100<br>
(Fig. 2) and assists the evaporation of the droplets 50, the oxidizing reactions<br>
and the doping reactions 450. Supersaturated gas phase oxides are formed,<br>
which are rapidly nucleated and condensed to particles in a condensation step<br>
460. External cooling gas 120 may be allowed to mix with the hot reaction<br>
gases to further promote condensation in a further condensation step 470.<br>
The produced particles 50 are separated from gases in a separation step 480<br>
and collected on the substrate 200 in a collection step 490. The separation<br>
step 480 and the collection step 490 take place primarily by thermophoresis.<br>
It is emphasized, that thanks to the efficient mixing in the flame 100 (Fig. 2),<br>
especially the oxidation step 440, the doping reactions step 450 and the<br>
condensation steps 460, 470 take place at a very fast rate and within a small<br>
volume of the flame. Consequently, the residence times of the reactants 10,<br>
20, 30, 40, the reaction products and the particles 50 within the flame are so<br>
short, that the reactions leading to clustering of erbium ions and the reactions<br>
leading to the separation of the different phases of the doped silica glass do<br>
not reach equilibrium. As pointed out before, this is especially beneficial<br>
regarding the light-amplifying properties of the produced doped silica.<br>
Referring to a further embodiment shown in Fig. 5, the velocity of the<br>
atomizing gas jet may be further increased by implementing an annular<br>
atomizing gas nozzle 22, which has a diverging cross section, for example a<br>
portion with a conically expanding inner surface. Such a nozzle may comprise<br>
also a constricted section 24. Preferably the nozzle 22 has the form of a Laval<br>
nozzle, which form is shown in Fig. 5. It is known that gas can be accelerated<br><br>
to a supersonic velocity using a Laval nozzle. Supersonic means a velocity,<br>
which is higher than the velocity of sound. So-called shock waves often exist<br>
in supersonic flows. The origin of the flame 100 (Fig. 2), i.e. the boundary of<br>
the flame near the nozzles may be stabilized to a position, which coincides<br>
with the position of a shock wave.<br>
Figs. 6a and 6b show a further embodiment having one or more liquid nozzles<br>
12 arranged according to a perpendicular geometry with respect to the<br>
atomizing gas nozzle 22.<br>
Figs. 7a and 7b show a further embodiment having several liquid nozzles 12<br>
arranged within one atomizing gas nozzle 22. One or more nozzles supplying<br>
gaseous reactants may also be arranged within the atomizing gas nozzle 22.<br>
This kind of a set-up is advantageous when scaling up the device 1000<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a further embodiment comprising a further diverging nozzle 80<br>
coupled to the burner assembly 600. Said further diverging nozzle 80 is<br>
preferably a Laval nozzle. The velocity of the combustion gases is increased<br>
even further, which reduces the reaction times and leads to the formation of<br>
even smaller and more homogeneous particles 50. Also adiabatic reduction of<br>
the gas temperature may take place in the shock wave SW. The temperature<br>
reduction in the shock wave SW is advantageous with regard to the<br>
condensation of the particles 50 and stopping of the chemical reactions<br>
leading to the formation of ion clusters, for example. A separate combustion<br>
chamber (not shown in the figures ) may be used before the diverging nozzle<br>
80.<br>
The flame 100 is an intense source of heat. Consequently, the nozzles 12, 22,<br>
32 (Fig. 2), 42 (Fig. 2), 80 may be provided with cooling means to prevent<br>
damage of the materials and/or to ensure problem-free flow of reactants. The<br>
cooling may be implemented by means of heat transfer medium, for example<br>
gas or water. The cooling may also be based on radiative cooling.<br>
Referring to Fig. 9, One or more of the nozzles 12, 22, 32, 42 may have<br>
elements 26 with angular orientation to induce swirling, i.e. rotating motion to<br><br>
the gases. Examples of such swirl-inducing elements are vanes or flanges<br>
with tilted slots or tilted holes to modify the direction of gas flow. The nozzles<br>
may also comprise perforated or mesh-type elements to enhance turbulence.<br>
The pressure p0 outside device 1000 may be altered by using an enclosure<br>
and a gas pump to affect the gas velocities, the particle collection efficiency,<br>
heat transfer rates and/or chemical reaction equilibria. Gas cleaning systems<br>
may be coupled to the process for example to remove chlorine-containing<br>
substances from exhaust gases.<br>
Temperatures, flow rates, pressures, positions of the nozzles and position of<br>
the substrate 200 (Fig. 2) are controlled by devices and components known by<br>
the person skilled in the art. The temperatures of the substrate 200 and the<br>
gases may be monitored by thermocouples and sensors based on emitted or<br>
absorbed spectral radiation. The proper form and symmetry of the flame 100<br>
(Fig. 2) may be monitored by an optical imaging system. Image sequences<br>
taken with short exposure times may assist in the monitoring of the degree of<br>
turbulence of the flamelOO and in the monitoring of the atomization process.<br>
Spectroscopical and fluorescent properties of the substrate 200 or of the<br>
produced material may be monitored on-line to assist in the control of the<br>
production of the particles 50.<br>
The atomizing gas 20 and/or reactants may also be supplied by a thermal<br>
plasma device, for example by using a direct-current non-transferred plasma<br>
torch, which is capable of accelerating the gas to a very high velocity and/or to<br>
a high temperature. Such plasma torches are known, for example, in the field<br>
of plasma spraying.<br>
For the person skilled in the art, it will be clear that modifications and<br>
variations of the device, method and light-amplifying waveguide according to<br>
the present invention are perceivable. The particular embodiments described<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
A Method for Producing Light-Amplifying<br>
Optical Material<br>
A method for producing light-amplifying optical material is disclosed.<br>
Liquid reactant (10) is atomized into droplets (15) using a high velocity gas<br>
(20). The droplets (15) are subsequently introduced into a flame (100).<br>
Reactants (10, 30) are oxidized in the flame (100) and condensed by forming<br>
small particles (50). At least a fraction of said particles (50) is collected and<br>
fused to form optical waveguide material, which is subsequently drawn to form<br>
an optical waveguide (750). According to the invention, the velocity of the<br>
atomizing gas (20) stream is in the order of the velocity of sound. The high<br>
velocity enhances atomization and increases reaction rates in the flame (100).<br>
The residence times are reduced to such a degree that unwanted phase<br>
transformations in the produced particles (50) are substantially minimized.<br>
Consequently, very homogeneous material is produced. Especially, in the<br>
production of erbium-doped silica, low percentage of clustered erbium ions is<br>
achieved.</td>
