				<td>The present invention relates to novel cycloalkyl-benzopyrans and derivatives<br>
thereof, compositions containing those compounds, their use as selective estrogen<br>
receptor-beta agonists, and their use in the treatment of estrogen receptor-beta mediated<br>
diseases such as prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, testicular cancer, ovarian<br>
cancer, lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, urinary<br>
incontinence, central nervous system (CNS) disorders, gastrointestinal (GI) tract<br>
disorders, and osteoporosis.<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
Estrogens play important roles in the development and homeostasis of the<br>
reproductive, central nervous, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems of both males and<br>
females. The estrogen receptor (ER) is currently the only member of the steroid<br>
subfamily of nuclear receptors that has different subtypes. Recently, a new ER isoform,<br>
ER-beta (also known as ER-betal) was cloned from a rat prostatic cDNA library and is<br>
present in murine and human prostates. Consequently, the previous ER is now designated<br>
as ER-alpha. ER-alpha and ER-beta share high amino acid homology, have similar 17-ß<br>
Estradiol (E2) binding affinities, and can hetero- or homodimerize to form a signaling<br>
complex; Kuiper GG, el al., Endocrinol. 138: 863-70 (1997); Kuiper GG et al., Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci. USA 93: 5925-30 (1996). Although E2 activates both ER-alpha and ER-beta,<br>
ER-alpha stimulates transcription and cellular proliferation, while ER-beta suppresses<br>
ER-alpha activation. Interestingly, 3-beta, 17-beta-androstanediol and 5-alpha-androstane<br>
have been proposed to be endogenous ligands for ER-beta; Weihua Z. et al. PNAS 98:<br>
6330-5 (2001). 3-Beta, 17-beta-androstanediol is a major metabolite of<br>
dihydrotestosterdne (DHT), the 5-alpha-reduced active intracellular androgen in male<br>
accessory sex organs. ER-beta activation also stimulates increased glutathione S-<br>
transferase and quinone reductase expression. These two enzymes have been shown to<br>
possess chemoprotective detoxification properties; Chang WY et al., Prostate 40: 115-24<br>
(1999); Montano MM et al., J. Biol. Chem. 273: 25443-9 (1998).<br>
With the recent identification of ER-beta, and the recognition that ER-alpha and<br>
ER-beta have different biological roles, ER-selective modulators would similarly possess<br>
significant clinical utility. Since ER-beta is strongly expressed in a number of tissues<br>
including prostate, bladder, ovary, testis, lung, small intestine, vascular endothelium, and<br>
various parts of the brain, compounds that selectively modulate ER-beta would be of<br>
clinical importance in the treatment of a variety of disease conditions, such as prostate<br>
cancer, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases,<br>
neurodegenerative disorders, urinary incontinence, CNS disorders, GI tract disorders, and<br>
osteoporosis. Such compounds would have minimal effect on tissues that contain ER-<br>
alpha, and thus exhibit different side-effect profiles. Thus, ER-beta agonists will display<br>
different therapeutic profiles compared to ER-alpha antagonists or agonists, and would be<br>
preferentially beneficial in tissues relying on ER-beta signaling.<br>
The prostate gland produces components that are found in the semen and blood.<br>
Some of these are regulatory peptides. ,The prostate gland comprises stroma and<br>
epithelium cells, the latter group consisting of columnar secretory cells and basal non-<br>
secretory cells. The proliferation of these basal cells, as well as stroma cells gives rise to<br>
benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is one common prostate disease. BPH is a<br>
progressive condition that is characterized by the nodular enlargement of the prostatic<br>
tissue resulting in obstruction of the urethra. This results in increased frequency of<br>
urination, noncuria, poor urine stream, and hesitation or delay in starting the urine flow.<br>
Consequences of BPH can include hypertrophy of bladder smooth muscle, decompensated<br>
bladder, and increased incidence of urinary tract infection. The development of BPH is<br>
considered to be an inescapable phenomenon for the aging male population. BPH is<br>
observed in approximately 70% of males over the age of 70. Drug treatment for BPH<br>
currently employs alpha andrenergic antagonists for symptomatic relief or steroid 5-alpha<br>
reductase inhibitors to reduce hyperplastic tissue bulk. These approaches are of limited<br>
therapeutic benefit.<br>
Mortality due to prostatic cancer when the strategem of watchful waiting is<br>
adopted is generally low (9%-l 5%) in men who have localized tumors. However, these<br>
rates pertain to patients with localized disease; they do not necessarily apply to younger<br>
men at higher risk. Younger men with stage T1a tumors have a longer projected period of<br>
risk than older men with the same stage of the disease and are therefore candidates for a<br>

substantially anhydrous form. In general, the acid addition salts of these compounds are<br>
soluble in water and various hydrophilic organic solvents, and which in comparison to<br>
their free base forms, generally demonstrate higher melting points.<br>
The expression "pharmaceutically acceptable basic addition salts" is intended to<br>
apply to any non-toxic organic or inorganic basic addition salts of the compounds<br>
represented by formula (I). Illustrative bases which form suitable salts include alkali<br>
metal or alkaline-earth metal hydroxides such as sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium,<br>
or barium hydroxides; ammonia, and aliphatic, alicyclic, or aromatic organic amines such<br>
as methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, and picoline. Either the mono- or di-<br>
basic salts can be formed with those compounds.<br>
Preferred embodiments of formula (I) are provided below:<br>
(1) Compounds in which the chiral centers designated as 2,3, and 4 are all in the<br>
cis-position;<br>
(2) Compounds in which G is -CH2- are preferred;<br>
(3) Compounds in which Y2 and Y3 are both -H are preferred;<br>
(4) Compounds in which one of R1 and R2 is -OH are prefared;<br>

(6) Compounds in which Y1 is -H are preferred;<br>
(7) Compounds in which one of R1 and R2 is -OH and the other is -H are<br>
preferred.<br>
It is understood that further preferred embodiments of formula (I) can be selected<br>
by requiring one or more of the preferred embodiments above. For example, the<br>
limitations of (1) can be combined with the limitations of (2); the limitations of (3) can be<br>

Reaction Schemes<br>
Compounds of formula (I) and intermediates thereof can be prepared as described<br>
in Reaction Schemes A through D below. All substituents, unless otherwise indicated, are<br>
previously defined. The reagents and starting materials are readily available to one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art.<br>
As used herein, R1", R2, R3", and Y1 correspond to the substituents R1, R2, R3, and<br>
Y1, respectively, except for when the R1, R2, and R3 substituents would be hydroxy and<br>
the Y1 substituent would be -H (making the -O-Y1 group a hydroxy). In these cases, the<br>
corresponding hydroxy group is protected with an alkoxymethylether, such as<br>
methoxymethyl ("MOM") or methoxyethoxymethyl ("MEM").<br>
In reaction Scheme A, step 1 a, the hydroxy groups on the phenol of formula (2)<br>
are protected with a suitable protecting group to provide the protected phenol of formula<br>
(4) utilizing techniques and procedures well know to one of ordinary skill in the art. For<br>
example, the phenol of formula (2) is combined with a suspension comprising a suitable<br>
anhydrous solvent such as anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF) and a suitable strong<br>
base such as a metal hydride, most preferably sodium hydride. To this suspension is<br>
added an amount of alkoxymethyl ether chloride, preferably M0M-C1, which corresponds<br>
to a roughly equimolar amount depending on the number of hydroxy groups to be<br>
protected on the phenol of formula (2). The reaction may be conducted at room<br>
temperature for a time ranging from about 30 minutes to about 2 days. The reaction is<br>
then quenched with water and an appropriate ether, such as diethyl ether or EtOAc, and<br>
the organic layer is washed with an appropriate base, such as sodium hydroxide or<br>
NaHCO3, and brine. The protected phenol of formula (4) may be isolated and purified by<br>
techniques well known in the art, such as extraction, evaporation, triruration,<br>
chromatography, and recrystallization.<br>
In Scheme A, step 1b, a 2-oxocycloalkanecarboxylate of formula (3) is activated<br>
via the triflate to provide the activated cycloalkane carboxylate of formula (5) utilizing<br>
procedures and techniques well known in the art; G. T. Crisp et al., J. Org. Chem. 57,<br>
6972-6975 (1992). For example, a methyl-2-oxocycloalkanecarboxylate of formula (3) is<br>
dissolved under anhydrous conditions in a suitable solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran,<br>
dichloromethane, acetone, ethyl acetate, toluene, or diethyl ether and contacted with a<br>
suitable activating agent such as triflic anhydride. The reaction is carried out in the<br>
presence of a base, such as N-methylmorpholine, sodium carbonate, triethylamine, N,N-<br>
diisopropylethylamine, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, pyridine and 2,6-di-tert-<br>
butyl-4-methyl-pyridine. The reaction is generally carried out at temperatures of from -<br>
78°C to ambient temperature. Generally, the reactions require 1 to 24 hours. The<br>
reaction may then be quenched. The product of formula (5) can be isolated and purified<br>
by techniques well known in the art, such as extraction, evaporation, trituration,<br>
chromatography, and recrystallization.<br>
In Scheme A, step 2, the protected phenol of formula (4) is coupled with the<br>
activated cycloalkane carboxylate of formula (5) to provide the coupled product of<br>
formula (6). For example, the coupling reaction is conducted in the presence of<br>
butyllithium, zinc chloride and a Pd species. The reaction is preferably carried out in a<br>
suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), and may initially be carried out under<br>
anhydrous condition. Preferably, the protected phenol of formula (4) is dissolved in a<br>
suitable solvent such as THF, treated with butyllithtam at reduced temperature, zinc<br>
chloride in solvent is then added and the temperature allowed to rise to ambient. The<br>
palladium species, such as tetrakis(triphenylphosphiae)Pd(0), is added together with the<br>
activated cycloalkane carboxylate of formula (5) and the temperature is preferably raised<br>
to the reflux temperature of the solvent for a period of time ranging from about 6 to 24<br>
hours. The coupled product of formula (6) can be isolated and purified by techniques well<br>
known in the art, such as extraction, evaporation, trituration, chromatography, and<br>
recrystallization.<br>
In Scheme A, step 3, the coupled product of formula (6) is reduced with a suitable<br>
reducing agent to provide the reduced product of formula (7) utilizing techniques and<br>
procedures well known in the art. For example, the coupled product of formula (6) is<br>
contacted with a suitable reducing agent, such as a palladium species, preferably 5% or<br>
10% carbon on palladium, in a suitable solvent or solvent mixture, such as methanol. The<br>
reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of asaitable base, such as a<br>
trialkylamine, more preferably, triethylamine. The reaction mixture is then heated to a<br>
temperature ranging from about 30°C to about reflux for a period of time ranging from<br>
about 2 to 24 hours. The reduced product of formula (7) can be isolated and purified by<br>
techniques well known in the art, such as extraction, evaporation, trituration,<br>
chromatography, and recrystallization.<br>
In Scheme A, step 4, the reduced product of formula (7) can be converted to the<br>
Weinreb-amide of formula (8). This reaction can be performed utilizing a reactin of the<br>
type described by J. M. Williams, et al., Tetrahedron Letters 36, 5461-5464 (1995). For<br>
example, the reduced product of formula (7) is combined with N,O-<br>
dimethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride in a suitable aprotic solvent, such as<br>
tetrahydrofuran, preferably under anhydrous conditions and cooled to a temperature<br>
ranging from about 0°C to about -30°C, more preferably about -10°C. A suitable<br>
Grignard reagent, preferably isopropyl magnesium chloride, is then added in a molar ratio<br>
of about 1.5 and reaction mixture is stirred for about 15 minutes to 2 hours. The reaction<br>
is then quenched with a proton source such as, for example, saturated ammonium<br>
chloride. The Weinreb-amide of formula (8) can be isolated and purified by techniques<br>
well known in the art, such as extraction, evaporation, triruration, chromatography, and<br>
recrystallization.<br>
In Scheme A, step 5, the Weinreb-amide of formula (8) is combined with the aryl<br>
lithium of formula (9) to form the ketone of formula (10). For example, the aryl lithium<br>
of formula (9) is added to a solution of Weinreb-amide of formula (8) in a suitable aprotic<br>
solvent, such as anhydrous THF, cooled to a temperature ranging from about -20°C to<br>
about 5°C, preferably 0°C, and stirred for a period of time ranging from about 15 minutes<br>
to 3 hours. The reaction is then quenched with a proton source, such as, for example,<br>
saturated sodium bicarbonate. The ketone of formula (10) can be isolated and purified by<br>
techniques well known in the art, such as extraction, evaporation, triruration, chromato-<br>
graphy, and recrystallization.<br>
In Scheme A, step 6a or 6b, the ketone of formula (10) is subjected to an acid-<br>
catalyzed cyclization followed by reduction of the resulting hemiketal to provide a<br>
compound of formula (IA or IA"), which represents the racemic mixture of a compound<br>
of formula (I). For example, in step 6a, p-toluenesulfonic acid is added in roughly<br>
equimolar proportions to the ketone of formula (10) in a suitable alcohol solvent, such as<br>
anhydrous methanol. The mixture is then heated at a temperature ranging from 40°C to<br>
60°C, preferably 50°C, for a period of time ranging from 12 to 24 hours, preferably 18<br>
hours. The reaction is then cooled to ambient temperature and a suitable reducing agent,<br>
such as sodium cyanoborohydride, is added along with a suitable indicator such as<br>
bromocreosol green in a procedure similar to that described by A. Srikrishna, et. Al.,<br>
Tetrahedron, vol. 51, no. 11, pp. 3339-3344,1995. Methanol saturated with hydrochloric<br>
acid is then slowly added until a yellow color is maintained. The reaction is stirred for<br>
about 1 to 2 hours past the point of final color change. The reaction is then quenched<br>
with a suitable proton acceptor, such as saturated sodium bicarbonate. This set of reaction<br>
conditions for step 6a will result in a cis-configuration of the chiral centers (e.g., those<br>
compounds in IB or IC). The R3SiH/TFA conditions of step 6b will result in a trans-<br>
configuration of the chiral centers (e.g., those compounds in ID or IE). The product of<br>
formula (IA) or (LV) can then be isolated and purified by techniques well known in the<br>
art, such as extraction, evaporation, trituration, chromatography, and recrystallization.<br>
Alternatively, the coupled product of formula (6) may be synthesized as described<br>
in reaction Scheme B. All substituents, unless otherwise indicated, are previously<br>
defined. The reagents and starting materials are readily available to one of ordinary skill<br>

In Scheme B, step 1, the hydroxy groups on the bromophenol of formula (11) are<br>
protected with a suitable protecting group to provide the protected bromophenol of<br>
formula (12) utilizing techniques and procedures as set forth in Scheme A, step 1a.<br>
In Scheme B, step 2, the protected bromophenol of formula (12) is coupled with<br>
the activated cycloalkane carboxylate of formula (5) to provide the coupled product of<br>
formula (6) according the techniques and procedures set forth in Scheme A, step 2.<br>
An alternative method for providing specific bromo-substituted intermediates are<br>
provided in Scheme C.<br>
Additionally, amido compounds of formula (II) as shown in of formulae (16) and<br>
(17) can be synthesized as described in scheme E. All substituents, unless otherwise<br>
indicated, are previously defined.<br><br>
The reagents and starting materials are readily available to one of ordinary skill in<br>
the art. In scheme E, step 1, a dihydroxy of formula (13) can be converted to a mixture of<br>
the monotriflate of formula (14) and the ditriflate of formula (15). The resulting mixture<br>
can be separated using conventional chromatography. In scheme E, step 2, the<br>
monotriflate of formula (14) and the ditriflate of formula (15) are cross coupled under<br>
palladium catalyzed carbonylation conditions with 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexamethyldisilylazane to<br>
afford carboxamides of formulae (16) and (17).<br>
Additionally, the amido of formula (19) can be synthesized as described in scheme<br>
F. All substituents, unless otherwise indicated, are previously defined.<br><br>
The reagents and starting materials are readily available to one of ordinary skill in<br>
the art. In scheme F, step 1, the dihydroxy of formula (13) can be selectively converted to<br>
the benzyl ether of formula (18). In scheme F, step 2, the remaining phenol is triflated,<br>
then immediately cross-coupled under identical conditions as scheme E, step 2. Finally,<br>
the benzyl group is removed to afford the caboxamide of formula (19) after HPLC<br>
purification.<br>
Additionally, compounds where R5 is C1-C6 alky] can be prepared as described in<br>
Scheme G.<br><br>
In Scheme G, the ketone of formula (10) is reacted with an alkyl organometallk<br>
reagent such as methyl lithium or ethyl magnesium bromide to form tertiary alcohols of<br>
formula (20). Under the acidic conditions described in Scheme A, step 6a, the tertiary<br>
alcohols form benzopyrans of formula (21).<br><br>

Test Procedures<br>
ER Binding Assay<br>
The competition ER binding assay was run in a buffer containing 50 mM N-[2-<br>
hydroxyethyl]piperazine-N"-[2-ethanesulfonicacid (Hepes)pH 7.5, 1.5 mMEDTA, 150<br>
mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mg/rnL ovalbumin, 5mM DTT, 0.025 µCi per well of 3H-<br>
Estradiol(NEN #NET517 at 118 Ci/mmol, 1 mCi/mL), and 10 ng/well ERAlpha or<br>
ERbeta Receptor (PanVera). Competing compounds were added at 10 different<br>
concentrations. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 1 µM of E2 (17-<br>
ß Estradiol, Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The binding reaction (140 µL) was incubated for 4<br>
hours at room temperature, then 70 µL of cold dextran coated charcoal (DCC) buffer was<br>
added to each reaction (DCC buffer was prepared by adding 0.75g of charcoal [Sigma]<br>
and O.25g of dextran [Pharmacia] per 50 mL of assay buffer). The incubation plates were<br>
mixed for 8 minutes on an orbital shaker at 4°C and then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10<br>
minutes at 4°C. An aliquot of 120 µl of the mix was transferred to another 96-well, white<br>
flat bottom plate (Costar)and 175 µ1 of Wallac Optiphase Hisafe 3 scintillation fluid was<br>
added to each well. The plates were sealed and then shaken vigorously on an orbital<br>
shaker. After an incubation of 2.5hrs, the radioactivity was counted in a Wallac<br>
Microbeta counter. The IC50 and percent inhibition at 10µM were calculated. The Kd for<br>
3H-Estradiol was determined by saturation binding to ERa and ERJ3 receptors. The IC50<br>
values for compounds were converted to Kf values using the Cheng-Prusoff equation and<br>
the Kd values were determined by saturation binding assay. Compounds of Examples 1-<br>
30 are active in the assay as described. The compounds of Table 1 bind to the ER beta<br>
receptor with a Ki of less than 100 nM. Preferred compounds bind to the ER beta receptor<br>
with a Ki of less than 20 nM. More preferred compounds bind to the ER beta receptor<br>
with a Kj of less than 1 nM. Compounds that are selective to binding to the ER beta<br>
receptor compared to the ER alpha receptor bind to the ER beta receptor with a lower Kj<br>
compared to the K; for the ER alpha receptor. Preferred selective ER beta compounds<br>
bind to ER beta receptor with a Kj(ER alpha)/K;(ER beta) ratio of greater than 4 as shown<br>
in Table 1.<br><br>
LNCaP Human PCa Xenograft Assay<br>
ERbeta agonists are evaluated for their effects on the growth of androgen-sensitive<br>
LNCaP human prostatic cancer (PCa) xenografts grown in intact sexually mature (5-6<br>
weeks old) Hsd: Athymic Nude-nu (Athymic Nude) male mice. 2.0xl06 LNCaP tumor<br>
cells are injected bilaterally by the subcutaneous route into the pre-tracheal region of<br>
testicular intact male mice. Mice are castrated via the scrotal route to serve as the positive<br>
control group. Test compounds are administered once per day by subcutaneous or gavage<br>
administration at multiple dose levels in a volume of 0.2 ml to xeuograft-bearing mice<br>
starting on the day following tumor injection. Test compounds are reformulated weekly<br>
based on average group mean body weights. The vehicle for these studies is 1 %<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) with 0.25% Tween 80. Body weights and tumor<br>
measurements are recorded on a weekly basis and entered directly into a JMP™ (SAS;<br>
Cary, NC) spreadsheet from electronic caliper measurement. Tumor volumes in mm3 are<br>
calculated in JMP using the following formula: L X W X H X 0.5236. Tumor and body<br>
weight responses for individual mice are recorded on a weekly basis. When LNCaP<br>
tumor volumes enter log-phase expansion, lesions are measured every 3-4 days. Growth<br>
rates are determined using linear modeling of the log tumor values and time to treatment<br>
failure (tumor vol=1300-1500 mm3) are determined using a linear extrapolation model<br>
(SAS; Cary, NC). Because of humane animal use considerations, animals are sacrificed<br>
when their tumor volumes approach 1200-1400 mm3. At necropsy, final tumor<br>
measurement and body weights are recorded and whole blood is obtained via cardiac<br>
puncture and allowed to clot on ice. Serum is transferred to appropriately labeled 0.5 ml<br>
Eppendorf micro tubes, and samples are stored at -80°C for biomarker analysis.<br>
General Rat Preparation Procedure<br>

surgical procedure at Charles River Laboratories, and then shipped after one week. Upon<br>
arrival, they are housed in metal hanging cages in groups of 3 or 4 per cage and have ad<br>
libitum access to food (calcium content approximately 0.5%) and water for one week.<br>
Room temperature is maintained at 22.2° ± 1.7°C with a minimum relative humidity of<br>
40%. The photoperiod in the room was 12 hours light and 12 hours dark.<br>
Dosing Regimen Tissue Collection: After a one week acclimation period<br>
(therefore, two weeks post-OVX) daily dosing with a compound of formula (I) ("F-I") is<br>
initiated. 17a-ethynyl estradiol or F-I is given orally, unless otherwise stated, as a<br>
suspension in 1% carboxymethylcellulose or dissolved in 20% cyclodextrin. Animals are<br>
dosed daily for 4 days. Following the dosing regimen, animals are weighed and<br>
anesthetized with a ketamine: Xylazine (2:1, v:v) mixture and a blood sample is collected<br>
by cardiac puncture. The animals are then sacrificed by asphyxiation with CO2, the<br>
uterus is removed through a midline incision, and a wet uterine weight is determined.<br>
17a-ethynyl estradiol is obtained from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO.<br>
Cardiovascular Disease/Hvperlipidemia<br>
The blood samples from above are allowed to clot at room temperature for 2<br>
hours, and serum is obtained following centrifugation for 10 minutes at 3000 rpm. Serum<br>
cholesterol is determined using a Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics high performance<br>
cholesterol assay. Briefly the cholesterol is oxidized to cholest-4-en-3-one and hydrogen<br>
peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide is then reacted with phenol and 4-aminophenazone in<br>
the presence of peroxidase to produce a p-quinone imine dye, which is read<br>
spectrophotemetrically at 500 nm. Cholesterol concentration is then calculated against a<br>
standard curve. The entire assay is automated using a Biomek Automated Workstation.<br>
Uterine Eosinophil Peroxidase (EPO) Assay<br>
The uteri from above are kept at 4°C until time of enzymatic analysis. The uteri<br>
are then homogenized in 50 volumes of 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.005%<br>
Triton X-100. Upon addition of 0.01% hydrogen peroxide and 10 mM O-<br>
phenylenediamine (final concentrations) in Tris buffer, increase in absorbance is<br>
monitored for one minute at 450 run. The presence of eosinophils in the uterus is an<br>
indication of estrogenic activity of a compound. The maximal velocity of a 15 second<br>
interval is determined over the initial, linear portion of the reaction curve.<br>
Inhibition of Bone Loss (Osteoporosis) Test Procedure<br>
Following the general preparation procedure described above, the rats are treated<br>
daily for thirty-five days (6 rats per treatment group) and sacrificed by carbon dioxide<br>
asphyxiation on the 36th day. The thirty-five day time period is sufficient to allow<br>
maximal reduction in bone density, measured as described herein. At the time of<br>
sacrifice, the uteri are removed, dissected free of extraneous tissue, and the fluid contents<br>
are expelled before determination of wet weight in order to confirm estrogen deficiency<br>
associated with complete ovariectomy. Uterine weight is routinely reduced about 75% in<br>
response to ovariectomy. The uteri are then placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin to<br>
allow for subsequent histological analysis.<br>
The right femurs are excised and digitilized X-rays generated and analyzed by an<br>
image analysis program (NIH image) at the distal metaphysis. The proximal aspect of the<br>
tibiae from these animals are also scanned by quantitative computed tomography. In<br>
accordance with the above procedures, F-I or ethynyl estradiol (EE2) in 20%<br>
hydroxypropyl P-cyclodextrin are orally administered to test animals.<br>
Therapeutic Methods of Use and Dosages<br>
Various diseases and conditions described to be treated herein, are well known and<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art. It is also recognized that one skilled in the art may<br>
affect the associated diseases and conditions by treating a patient presently afflicted with<br>
the diseases or conditions or by prophylactically treating a patient afflicted with the<br>
diseases or conditions with a therapeutically effective amount of the compounds of<br>
formula (I).<br>
As used herein, the term "patient" refers to a warm blooded animal such as a<br>
mammal that is afflicted with a particular estrogen receptor-beta mediated disease. It is<br>
understood that guinea pigs, dogs, cats, rats, mice, horses, cattle, sheep, and humans are<br>
examples of animals within the scope of the meaning of the term.<br>
As used herein, the term "therapeutically effective amount" of a compound of<br>
formula (I) refers to an amount which is effective in controlling diseases and conditions<br>
associated with estrogen receptor-beta mediated diseases such as prostate cancer, benign<br>
prostatic hyperplasia, testicular cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative<br>
disorders, urinary incontinence, CNS disorders, GI tract disorders, and osteoporosis. The<br>
term "controlling" is intended to refer to all processes wherein there may be a slowing,<br>
interrupting, arresting, or stopping of the progression of the diseases and conditions<br>
described herein, but does not necessarily indicate a total elimination of all disease and<br>
condition symptoms, but does include prophylactic treatment of the diseases and<br>
conditions associated with estrogen receptor-beta mediated diseases such as prostate<br>
cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, testicular cancer, cardiovascular diseases,<br>
neurodegenerative disorders, urinary incontinence, CNS, GI tract disorders, and<br>
osteoporosis.<br>
A therapeutically effective amount can be readily determined by the attending<br>
diagnostician, as one skilled in the art, by the use of conventional techniques and by<br>
observing results obtained under analogous circumstances. In determining the<br>
therapeutically effective amount, the dose, a number of factors are considered by the<br>
attending diagnostician, including, but not limited to: the species of mammal; its size, age,<br>
and general health; the specific disease involved; the degree of or involvement or the<br>
severity of the disease; the response of the individual patient; the particular compound<br>
administered; the mode of administration; the bioavailability characteristic of the<br>
preparation administered; the dose regimen selected; the use of concomitant medication;<br>
and other relevant circumstances.<br>
A therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) is expected to<br>
vary from about 0.001 milligram per kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg/day) to<br>
about 100 mg/kg/day. Preferred amounts can be determined by one skilled in the art.<br>
In effecting treatment of a patient afflicted with the diseases and conditions<br>
described above, a compound of formula (I) can be administered in any form or mode<br>
which makes the compound bioavailable in a therapeutically effective amount, including<br>
oral, inhalation, and parenteral routes. For example, compounds of formula (I) can be<br>
administered orally, by inhalation of an aerosol or dry powder, subcutaneously,<br>
intramuscularly, intravenously, transderrnally, intranasally, rectally, topically, and the like.<br>
Oral or inhalation administration is generally preferred for treatment of respiratory<br>
diseases, e.g. asthma. One skilled in the art of preparing formulations can readily select<br>
the proper form and mode of administration depending upon the particular characteristics<br>
of the compound selected, the disease or condition state to be treated, the stage of the<br>
disease or condition, and other relevant circumstances. (Remington"s Pharmaceutical<br>
Sciences, 1 Sth Edition, Mack Publishing Co. (1990)).<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be administered alone or in the form<br>
of a pharmaceutical composition in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carriers or excipients, the proportion and nature of which are determined by the solubility<br>
and chemical properties of the compound selected, the chosen route of administration, and<br>
standard pharmaceutical practice. The compounds of the present invention, while<br>
effective themselves, may be formulated and administered in the form of their<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, such as acid addition salts or base addition salts, for<br>
purposes of stability, convenience of crystallization, increased solubility and the like.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I)<br>

with sugar, shellac, or other enteric coating agents. A syrup may contain, in addition to<br>
the present compounds, sucrose as a sweetening agent and certain preservatives, dyes and<br>
colorings and flavors. Materials used in preparing these various compositions should be<br>
pharmaceutically pure and non-toxic in the amounts used.<br>
For the purpose of parenteral therapeutic administration, the compounds of the<br>
present invention may be incorporated into a solution or suspension. These preparations<br>
should contain at least 0.1% of a compound of the invention, but may be varied to be<br>
between 0.1 and about 50% of the weight thereof. The amount of the compound of<br>
formula (I) present in such compositions is such that a suitable dosage will be obtained.<br>
Preferred compositions and preparations are able to be determined by one skilled in the<br>
art.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also be administered by inhalation,<br>
such as by aerosol or dry powder. Delivery may be by a liquefied or compressed gas or by<br>
a suitable pump system that dispenses the compounds of the present invention or a<br>
formulation thereof. Formulations for administration by inhalation of compounds of<br>
formula (I) may be delivered in single phase, bi-phasic, or tri-phasic systems. A variety of<br>
