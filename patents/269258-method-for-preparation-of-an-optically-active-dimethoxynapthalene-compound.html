SPECIFICATION<br>
DERMATITIS TREATING AGENT<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a novel topical<br>
agent useful for treatment of dermatitis such as atopic<br>
dermatitis and the like.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Dermatitis is an inflammatory disease at the skin<br>
against various kinds of endogenetic and exogenetic<br>
invasion, and the disease includes atopic dermatitis,<br>
contact dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, nummular eczema,<br>
autosensitization eczema and the like. These dermatitises<br>
accompany itching in many cases. Also, of these, atopic<br>
dermatitis is a refractory chronic inflammatory disease<br>
which repeats remission and exacerbation, and involvement<br>
of a late phase reaction that accompanies invasion of<br>
eosinophils or lymphocyte and production of various kinds<br>
of cytokines at a site of inflammation has been suggested<br>
for pathogeny and chronicity of the disease (Non-Patent<br>
Literatures 1 and 2).<br>
For the treatment of atopic dermatitis, a treatment<br>
by a medicament depending on the symptom has been employed<br>
in combination with removal of factors of causing diseases<br>
or exacerbation and skin care, and a topical steroid agent<br>
has mainly been used against inflammation. Also,<br>
tacrolimus which is a kind of an immunosuppressive agent<br>
has recently been used for the treatment of atopic<br>
dermatitis. However, these existing medicaments are not<br>
necessarily satisfied in the points of safety and side<br>
effects. Thus, it has been desired to develop a<br>
therapeutic agent for dermatitis not only having<br><br>
2<br>
effectiveness but also high safety.<br>
It has been known that Compound [I] which is an<br>
active ingredient of the present invention has selective<br>
phosphodiesterase IV (PDE IV) inhibitory activity, and<br>
useful as an agent for prophylaxis and treatment of asthma<br>
and the like. (Patent Literatures 1 and 2). However, it<br>
has not been reported that said Compound [I] is useful as<br>
an agent for treatment of dermatitis such as atopic<br>
dermatitis and the like.<br>

method of a topical preparation. For example, an ointment<br>
or a cream can be prepared by mixing and kneading,<br>
emulsifying or suspending raw materials of a base depending<br>
on the respective dosage form to prepare the base, adding<br>
an active ingredient(s) and various kinds of additives, and<br>
mixing it in a mixer such as a screw mixer and the like.<br>

purified water, mixing and stirring the same, then, adding<br>
an active ingredient(s) and an additive(s) to the mixture,<br>
and subjecting to filtration, if necessary.<br>
As a base for the liniment, there may be mentioned,<br>
