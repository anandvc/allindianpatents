DYNAMIC AND INTELLIGENT BUFFER MANAGEMENT FOR SAN<br>
EXTENSION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to digital communication networks, and<br>
more specifically, to methods and systems for efficiently transporting Fibre<br>
Channel/FICON client data over a SONET/SDH network path.<br>
SONET/SDH and optical fiber have emerged as significant technologies for<br>
building large scale, high speed, IP (Internet Protocol)-based networks. SONET, an<br>
acronym for Synchronous Optical Network, and SDH, an acronym for Synchronous<br>
Digital Hierarchy, are a set of related standards for synchronous data transmission over<br>
fiber optic networks. SONET/SDH is currently used in wide area networks (WAN) and<br>
metropolitan area networks (MAN). A SONET system consists of switches, multiplexers,<br>
and repeaters, all connected by fiber. The connection between a source and destination is<br>
called a path.<br>
One network architecture for the network interconnection of computer devices is<br>
Fibre Channel, the core standard of which is described in ANSI (American National<br>
Standards Institute) X3.230-1994. Arising out of data storage requirements, Fibre<br>
Channel currently provides for bi-directional gigabits-per-second transport over Storage<br>
Area Networks (SANs) in Fibre Channel frames that consist of standardized sets of bits<br>
used to carry data over the network system. Fibre Channel links are limited to no more<br>
than 10 kilometers. Similar to Fibre Channel is FICON, a proprietary I/O channel which<br>
was developed by IBM for the data storage requirements for main frame computers.<br>
New standards and protocols have emerged to combine the advantages of the<br>
SONET/SDH and Fibre Channel/FICON technologies. For example, it is sometimes<br>
desirable to link two SANs, which operate with Fibre Channel or FICON protocols, over a<br>
MAN (Metropolitan Area Network), or even a WAN (Wide Area Network), which<br>
typically operate under SONET or SDH standards. This extension of SANs from 100<br>
kilometers to over several hundred, or even thousand, kilometers, is made by mapping<br>
Fibre Channel/FICON ports to a SONET/SDH path for transport across a SONET/SDH<br>
network. One way to perform this function is to encapsulate Fibre Channel/FICON client<br>
data frames into transparent Generic Framing Protocol (GFP-T) frames and then map the<br><br>
GFP-T frames into SONET/SDH frames for transport across the SONET/SDH network.<br>
In this manner two Fibre Channel/FICON ports can communicate with each other over a<br>
SONET/SDH network as though the intervening network links are part of a Fibre<br>
Channel/FICON network. The Fibre Channel/FICON ports remain "unaware" of the<br>
SONET/SDH transport path. For example, see U.S. Patent Application No. 10/390,813,<br>
entitled, "Method and System for Emulating a Fibre Channel Link Over a Sonet/SDH<br>
Path," filed March 18, 2003 and assigned to the present assignee.<br>
For the effective movement of data across SAN networks, these network systems<br>
have two types of flow control: 1) end-to-end, and 2) buffer-to-buffer credit. In both<br>
types of flow control, two Fibre Channel/FICON ports report to each other how many<br>
frames is available at the reporting port's buffer to receive Fibre Channel/FICON frames<br>
from the other port. In end-to-end flow control, the source and destination ports are the<br>
two ports and the ports signal each other the reception of a transmitted frame by an ACK<br>
Link Control frame. In buffer-to-buffer credit, the two ports on opposite sides of a link are<br>
the two ports and the ports communicate the reception of a transmitted frame with an<br>
R_Rdy Primitive signal. But flow control remains within the SAN network and is based<br>
on counting Fibre Channel/FICON frames which can vary. Flow control may also be<br>
extended across SONET/SDH transport networks which connect frame-based protocol<br>
networks, such as Fibre Channel/FICON and gigabit Ethernet. See, for example, U.S.<br>
Patent Application No. 10/613,426, entitled, "Method and System For Efficient Flow<br>
Control For Client Data Frames Over GFP Across a SONET/SDH Transport Path," filed<br>
July 3,2003 and assigned to the present assignee.<br>
Nonetheless, for SAN extensions, i.e., interconnecting SANs by SONET/SDH<br>
transport networks, the SAN extension devices (the Fibre Channel/FICON ports<br>
communicating over a SONET/SDH network) usually provide a large amount of buffering<br>
in order to maintain a 100% throughput over very long distances. Because of the large<br>
number of buffers in the SAN extension devices, a great deal of latency can be created for<br>
the frames passing through the devices. It is possible that sometimes the latency<br>
introduced by extra buffering can be a significant portion of the total latency, even<br>
compared to the latency of the long distance communication.<br>
The present invention addresses this problem of inappropriate buffering with<br>
buffer management which is dynamic and intelligently selective for the particular SAN<br>
extension.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides for a method of operating a transport interface for<br>
at least one local Fibre Channel/FICON port, the transport interface having buffers for<br>
Fibre Channel/FICON data encapsulated in GFP frames transported over a SONET/SDH<br>
network from a remote Fibre Channel/FICON port. The method has the steps of inserting<br>
a special latency instruction message into Fibre Channel/FICON data to be encapsulated in<br>
a GFP frame for transmission to the remote Fibre Channel/FICON port; sending the GFP .<br>
frame over the SONET/SDH transport network to the remote Fibre Channel/FICON port;<br>
timing a return of the special latency number over the said SONET/SDH transport<br>
network; determining an appropriate amount of buffers in the transport interface for GFP<br>
frames from the remote Fibre Channel/FICON port from the timing step; and allocating<br>
the appropriate amount of buffers in the transport interface for GFP frames from the<br>
remote Fibre Channel/FICON port; whereby sufficient buffering is ensured in the transport<br>
interface to provide maximum throughput over the SONET/SDH network and any<br>
additional latency due to buffering in the transport interface is reduced.<br>
Furthermore, the inserting, sending, timing, determining and allocating steps are<br>
repeated periodically so that the amount of allocated buffers is adjusted even if the latency<br>
of GFP frames transported over said SONET/SDH network between the local and remote<br>
Fibre Channel/FICON ports changes. A period of about J second is used for the described<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The special latency instruction message, which is<br>
inserted in a Client Payload Information field of the Payload Area of the GFP frame,<br>
includes a latency sequence number to identify one sequence of inserting, sending, timing,<br>
determining and allocating steps from another sequence of inserting, sending, timing,<br>
determining and allocating steps; a special character encoded in a 4-bit mapping of the<br>
64B/65B control characters as Fh; and a command to a transport interface for the remote<br>
Fibre Channel/FICON port to resend said special latency instruction message back to the<br>
transport interface for the at least one local Fibre Channel/FICON port upon receiving the<br>
special latency instruction message.<br>
In a network system for transporting GFP-encapsulated Fibre Channel/FICON data<br>
across a SONET/SDH transport network between first and second Fibre Channel/FICON<br>
ports, the first Fibre Channel/FICON port connected to the SONET/SDH transport<br>
network through a first transport interface and the second Fibre Channel/FICON port<br><br>
connected to the SONET/SDH transport network through a second transport interface, the<br>
present invention also provides for the first transport interface which has at least one<br>
integrated circuit adapted to insert a special latency instruction message into Fibre<br>
Channel/FICON data from the first Fibre Channel/FICON port and to encapsulate the<br>
Fibre Channel/FICON data in a GFP frame, to send the GFP frame over the SONET/SDH<br>
transport network to the second transport interface of the second Fibre Channel/FICON<br>
port, to time a return of the special latency instruction message over the SONET/SDH<br>
transport network, to determine an appropriate amount of buffers in the first transport<br>
interface from a time interval of the special latency instruction message to return, and to<br>
allocate the appropriate amount of buffers in the first transport interface for GFP frames<br>
from the second Fibre Channel/FICON port so that sufficient buffering is ensured in the<br>
first transport interface to provide maximum throughput over the SONET/SDH network<br>
and any additional latency due to buffering in the transport interface is reduced.<br>
The at least one integrated circuit is further adapted to insert the special latency<br>
instruction message, to encapsulate the Fibre Channel/FICON data in a GFP frame, to<br>
send the GFP frame, to time the return of the special latency instruction message, to<br>
determine the appropriate amount of buffers and to allocate the appropriate amount of<br>
buffers periodically so that the amount of allocated buffers is adjusted as the actual latency<br>
of GFP frames transported over the SONET/SDH network between the first and second<br>
Fibre Channel/FICON ports changes.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS<br>
The following description is presented to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to<br>
make and use the invention. Descriptions of specific embodiments and applications are<br>
provided only as examples and various modifications will be readily apparent to those<br>
skilled in the art. The general principles described herein may be applied to other<br>
embodiments and applications without departing from the scope of the invention. Thus,<br>
the present invention is not to -be limited to the embodiments shown, but is to be accorded<br>
the widest scope consistent with the principles and features described herein. For purpose<br>
of clarity, details relating to technical material that is known in the technical fields related<br>
to the invention have not been described in detail.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates an exemplary network of Fiber Channel/FICON ports are<br>
connected over a SONET/SDH transport network 10 in which an embodiment of the<br>
present invention can operate. In the present example, it is assumed that the ports operate<br>
under Fibre Channel or FICON protocols, though the ports may also operate under other<br>
frame-based protocols, such as gigabit Ethernet, in accordance with the present invention.<br>
In the exemplary network Fibre Channel/FICON ports 16 and 18 are connected by<br>
Fibre Channel/FICON links 15 and 17 respectively to a multi-port Fibre Channel/FICON<br>
card 14. Likewise, a second Fibre Channel/FICON port card 24 is connected by Fibre<br>
Channel/FICON links 25 and 27 to Fibre Channel/FICON ports 26 and 28 respectively.<br>
The Fibre Channel/FICON ports 16, 18, 26 and 28 are associated with elements which are<br>
interconnected by Fibre Channel/FICON protocols in SANs. These elements include data<br>
storage elements, including disk drive arrays, RAIDs, disk farms, or possibly Fibre<br>
Channel network elements, such as routers, switches, or other Fibre Channel network<br>
elements. In Fig.l each Fibre Channel/FICON port card 14 and 24 is connected to a pair<br>
of Fibre Channel/FICON ports for purposes of illustration, and more ports may be<br>
connected to each Fibre Channel/FICON port card.<br>
The SONET/SDH network 10 provides a transport path to connect the Fibre<br>
Channel/FICON ports 16 and 18 with the Fibre Channel ports 26 and 28 so that Fibre<br>
Channel/FICON client data can be transferred between the ports 16, 18 and 26,28.<br>
Optical transport platforms 12 and 22, such as ONS 15454 (available from Cisco Systems,<br>
Inc. of San Jose, California), provide the interface between the Fibre Channel/FICON and<br>
SONET/SDH networks. The Fibre Channel/FICON ports 16 and 18 are connected to the<br><br>
multi-port Fibre Channel/FICON card 14 which is adapted to fit into the optical transport<br>
platform 12; the Fibre Channel/FICON ports 26 and 28 are connected to the multi-port<br>
Fibre Channel/FICON card 24 which adapted to fit into the optical transport platform 22.<br>
Through the Fibre Channel/FICON port caids 14 and 24, which function as transport<br>
interfaces with the platforms 12 and 22 respectively, the Fibre Channel/FICON ports 16<br>
and 18 are interconnected*to the Fibre Channel/FICON ports 26 and 28 across the<br>
SONET/SDH network transport path. The result is that there are two virtual wires for the<br>
connection between a representative Fibre Channel/FICON port at one end of the<br>
SONET/SDH network 10, say, port 18, and a representative Fibre Channel port at the<br>
other end, say, port 28. As explained above, GFP-T, transparent Generic Framing<br>
Procedure, is conventionally used as the framing protocol for such a network to<br>
encapsulate the Fibre Channel/FICON payloads at one end of the SONET/SDH network<br>
10 for transmission across the SONET/SDH network and to decapsulate the Fibre<br>
Channel/FICON data at the other end. By GFP-T protocol, the GFP-T frames have fixed<br>
lengths.<br>
While the port cards 14 and 24 and their respective optical platforms 12 and 22 are<br>
the transport interfaces for the exemplary network of Fig- 1, the transport interfaces can be<br>
considered to be located in the port cards 14 and 24 for the described embodiment of the<br>
present invention. The cards 14 and 24 each have FIFO (First-In First-Out) buffers to hold<br>
the GFP frames received from the SONET/SDH transport network 10 before the<br>
encapsulated Fibre Channel/FICON frames of the described embodiment of the present<br>
invention, are stripped out of the GFP-encapsulation frames and passed on to their Fibre<br>
Channel port destinations.<br>
The port cards 14 and 24, which extend the SANs so that they are interconnected,<br>
operate as intermediate transparent devices on a SAN network. Heretofore, such SAN<br>
extension devices typically have a configuration mechanism by which the user could<br>
select the number of FIFO buffers for the frames transported across the SONET/SDH<br>
network. The mechanism helps the user choose the number of buffers required for the<br>
SAN extension over a long distance and in order to maintain a 100% throughput over the<br>
long distances of SONET/SDH transport network 10, the mechanism typically selects a<br>
large amount of buffering usually provided in the SAN extension devices. However, a<br>
large amount of latency is added for the frames passing through the devices, because of<br>
the large number of buffers in the SAN extension devices.<br><br>
These configuration mechanisms may not be accurate nor appropriate for the<br>
particular SONET/SDH transport path. Also, changes can occur in a transport network,<br>
e.g., an increased path delay because of a SONET/SDH switchover, thus changing the<br>
buffering requirements for the SAN extension devices.<br>
To address these problems, the present invention accurately determines the round<br>
trip delay (a measure of distance) from one SAN extension device across a SONET/SDH.<br>
transport network fo another SAN extension device and back. Once the latency is<br>
accurately determined, the number of buffers required in the first SAN extension device is<br>
calculated and programmed into the hardware of the device. Since the number of required<br>
buffers are configured for the current distance between the two SAN extension devices,<br>
any additional latency due to extra buffering is avoided. Only the required number of<br>
buffers on the SAN extension devices is allocated to reduce latency. For example, 1G<br>
(base clock rate of 1.0625 GHz for Fibre Channel/FICON data transfer) Fibre<br>
Channel/FICON client data sent over a 1200Km (one-way) transport path requires 600<br>
(2Kbyte) buffers for a sustained 100% throughput. However, if the same 600 buffers are<br>
used for a 200Km circuit, the extra 500 buffers add an unwanted latency of about 5ms,<br>
thereby making the solution unsuitable for certain applications. Due to the inherent bursty<br>
nature of Fibre Channel/FICON traffic, the extra buffering can be filled with an additional<br>
500 frames to add undesired latency. By limiting the number of buffers used, traffic is<br>
backpressured all the way to the Fibre Channel/FICON source and thereby reduces<br>
unwanted latency on all traffic.<br>
It should be noted that although a 1G Fibre Channel/FICON client operation speed<br>
is mentioned above, the present invention works effectively with Fibre Channel/FICON<br>
clients operating at 2G (double base clock rate or 2.125 GHz ) or any other Fibre Channel/<br>
FICON speed.<br>
Also, with the present invention any SONET/SDH switchover or protection event<br>
which leads to a new SONET/SDH path and new distance is automatically detected and<br>
the amount of buffers is adjusted accordingly. The buffer adjustments are performed<br>
without any hits or errors to the SAN traffic.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a special latency instruction message<br>
with an incrementing latency sequence number is periodically inserted into the GFP<br>
Client Payload Information field of the GFP-T frames encapsulating (lie Fibre<br>
Channel/FICON payload frames that are to be transported across SONET/SDH transport<br><br>
path. The special latency instruction message with latency sequence number includes a<br>
special K character that is not used in the Fibre Channel/FICON protocol and is never<br>
forwarded to the Fibre Channel/FICON client. It is only used between the Fibre<br>
Charmel/FICON-Over-SONET/SDH equipment, such as the transport interfaces, i.e., the<br>
port cards 14 and 24, with the interconnecting SONET/SDH transport network 10 in the<br>
Fig. 1 network, for example. Upon sending the Fibre Channel/FICON frames<br>
encapsulated in the GFP frame with the special latency number, the local transport<br>
interface, i.e., the GFP transmitter, starts a timer.<br>
At the remote or receiving transport interface, i.e., the GFP receiver, immediately<br>
responds to the special latency number by sending it back to the GFP transmitter across<br>
the SONET/SDH transport network.<br>
Upon receiving the special latency instruction message and latency sequence<br>
number, the local transport interface reads its timer and has an accurate determination of<br>
the latency in sending frames across the SONET/SDH network to and from the GFP<br>
receiver. From the latency determination, the number of buffers required in the local<br>
transport interface, the port card 14 in this embodiment, is calculated and programmed into<br>
the hardware of the device. The local transport interface monitors the latency in the<br>
SONET/SDH transport path to the remote transport interface continually by repeating the<br>
procedure described above periodically. In the described embodiment this period is 1<br>
second.<br>
Figs. 2A and 2B are flow charts which illustrate the steps of operation of an<br>
exemplary local transport interface, the port card 14 in this case, in transmitting and<br>
receiving encapsulating GFP frames to and from a remote transport interface, the port card<br>
24, in accordance with the present invention. In this manner the local and remote transport<br>
interfaces effectively extend their respective SANs to each other's SAN.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2A, after the initialization of the local and remote transport<br>
interfaces and initial communication is established over the SONET/SDH transport path,<br>
as indicated by a dotted arrow, a Timer 1 in the port card 14 is started in step 30. After<br>
engaging in different operations not directly related to the present operations, the port card<br>
14 reaches a decision step 31. Has the Timer 1 reached a value Tl, in this example, one<br>
second? If not, other operations between steps 30 and 31 not directly related to the present<br>
invention are resumed. For example, the transfer of GFP superblock frames may be<br><br>
resumed. If so, on the other hand, then a special latency sequence number from a special<br>
latency counter in the port card 14 is inserted into the next GFP frame by step 32. In step<br>
33 the special latency counter is incremented and the GFP frame is sent by step 34 from<br>
the port card 14 to the port card 24 across the SONET/SDH transport network 10 and at<br>
the same time, the port card 14 also starts a Timer 2. In step 36 the Timer 1 is reset and<br>
the process returns back to the operations between steps 30 and 31.<br>
Fig. 3A illustrates an exemplary GFP-T frame 50 with the special latency<br>
instruction message and latency sequence number which is assembled and sent by the<br>
local port card 14. The special instruction message and latency sequence number is placed<br>
in the GFP Client Payload Information field 54, such as found in the exemplary GFP<br>
frame 50 with its component Core Header 51 and Payload Area 52. Within the Payload<br>
Area 52 is a Payload Header field 53 and the Client Payload Information field 54. Fig. 3B<br>
illustrates the 36-bit special latency instruction message and latency sequence number<br>
which is inserted into the 10B/8B client data stream from the Fibre Channel/FICON port<br>
18 at the Fibre Channel/FICON port card 14. In accordance with GFP-T procedures (see<br>
clause 8 of the ITU-T Generic Framing Procedure standard G.7041/Y.1303, for example),<br>
the decoded 10B/8B client data is mapped into 65B/64B block code and then into<br>
65B/64B superblocks for placement into a GFP Client Payload Information field. In the<br>
special latency instruction message, the 4-bit "8h" (8 in hexadecimal) defines the<br>
data[31:24] as a control word; the 8-bit "44h" within the control word is a special control<br>
character to the Fibre Channel/FICON receiving port card, the port card 24 in this<br>
example. The 20-bit incrementing latency sequence number identifies each latency<br>
determining operation. It should be noted that, as other Fibre Channel/FICON control<br>
characters, the special latency control character "44h" is encoded in a 4-bit mapping of<br>
65B/64B control characters. The special latency control character is mapped as Fh<br>
("1111"), with the associated command in the following 4 bits to instruct the receiving<br>
port card to send back the special latency instruction message and back over the<br>
SONET/SDH transport network to the initial transmitter port card.<br>
Thus, across the SONET/SDH transport network 10, the remote port card 24 upon<br>
receipt of the GFP frame sent by the port card 14 by step 35, immediately sends a GFP<br>
frame with the special latency instruction message with its latency sequence number back<br>
across the SONET/SDH transport network 10 to the port card 14. Upon receiving the GFP<br>
Frame in step 38 shown in Fig. 2B, the port card 14 determines by step 39 whether the<br>
GFP frame contains the special latency sequence number. If not, the process returns to<br><br>
handle the GFP frame as a transmission of data from the remote port card 24 to the local<br>
port card 14. If the GFP frame does have the special latency sequence number, then by<br>
step 4012 from Timer 2 indicates the time required for a GFP frame from the local port<br>
card 14 to traverse the SONET/SDH network 10 to the remote port card 24 and back<br>
again.<br>
The appropriate number of buffers for transmission of GFP frames are calculated<br>
from T2 time interval in step 41 and in step 42 that number of buffers is allocated in the<br>
local port card 14 for the GFP frames from the transmitting port card 24. For a 100%<br>
throughput and a minimum transmission latency, it has been found that the allocation of a<br>
buffer of 2Kbytes of memory for every 2Km is effective. Thus as stated previously, for a<br>
determined time T corresponding to a 1200Km one-way trip across the SONET/SDH<br>
transport network 10, it is determined that 600 buffers, each buffer having a memory<br>
capacity of 2Kbytes, is appropriate. For a 200Km circuit, 100 buffers are appropriate<br>
based on the speed of light and a maximum Fibre Channel/FICON frame size of 2148<br>
bytes. This calculation in step 41 is straightfoward to those skilled in the card and can be<br>
substituted with a simple look-up table. Finally., Timer 2 is reset to be restarted by step 35<br>
shown in Fig. 2A.<br>
The distances and hence the roundtrip time T2 may change with failovers in the<br>
SONET/SDK network 10. The individual links in the network 10 may change with<br>
various failures in the links of the network 10 and the path rerouted. To accommodate<br>
these changes, the Timer 1 assures that the local port card 14 constantly monitors the<br>
latency between the local port card 14 and the remote port card 24 with a period Tl, one<br>
second in this embodiment As the distance between the port cards 14 and 24 change,<br>
measured in roundtrip time, the appropriate number of buffers is continually evaluated and<br>
set in the local port card 14. In a similar fashion, the remote port 24 sets the appropriate<br>
number of buffers for GFP frames from the local port card 14.<br>
The embodiment of the present invention described above is best implemented in<br>
the port cards 14 and 24 in the exemplary network of Fig. 1. The operations described<br>
above require a timer and counter, besides logic. A hardware implementation in an ASIC<br>
(Application Specific Integrated Circuit) or an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) is<br>
preferred for a high-speed implementation of the present invention for optimal<br>
transmission of the client data frames across the SONET/SDH transport network.<br><br>
Where throughput is not necessarily paramount, the present invention might be<br>
implemented in firmware, such as the ROM (Read-Only Memory) of a microcontroller, or<br>
in software which offers certain advantages. For instance, the processor unit instructed by<br>
the software might also perform operations other than those described, or upgrades can be<br>
made easily in software. Fig. 4 shows a block diagram of a representative computer<br>
system 60 that may be used to execute the software of an embodiment of the invention.<br>
The computer system 60 includes memory 62 which can store and retrieve software<br>
programs incorporating computer code that implements aspects of (he invention, data for<br>
use with the invention, and the like. Exemplary computer readable storage media include<br>
CD-ROM, floppy disk, tape, flash memory, semiconductor system memory, and hard<br>
drive. The computer system 60 further includes subsystems such as a central processor<br>
61, fixed storage 64 (e.g., hard'drive), removable storage 66 (e.g., CD-ROM drive), and<br>
one or more network interfaces 67, all connected by a system bus 68. Other computer<br>
systems suitable for use with the invention may include additional or fewer subsystems.<br>
For example, computer system 60 may include more than one processor 61 (i.e., a multi-<br>
processor system) or a cache memory. The computer system 60 may also include a<br>
display, keyboard, and mouse (not shown) for use as a host. Therefore, while the<br>
description above provides a full and complete disclosure of the preferred embodiments of<br>
the present invention, various modifications, alternate constructions, and equivalents will<br>
be obvious to those with skill in the art. Thus, the scope of the present invention is limited<br>
solely by the metes and bounds of the appended claims.<br><br>
