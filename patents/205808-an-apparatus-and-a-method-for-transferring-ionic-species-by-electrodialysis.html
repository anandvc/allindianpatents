COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10: rule 13]<br><br><br>
"A METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ISOLATION OF IONIC   ELECTRODIALYSIS"<br><br>
JURAG SEPARATION APS, a Danish company of DTU, Building 229, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark,<br>
The  following  specification  particularly  describes  the   nature   of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a method for isolation of ionic species from a liquid and an apparatus for isolation of ionic species from a liquid. Moreover the invention relates to an electro enhanced dialysis cell and the use of the cell in the method and the apparatus .<br>
isolation of ionic species from liquids is a very important industrial process used within such a broad technical field, as from refining metals to purification of lactic acid from a fermented liquid.<br>
?. large number of processes and apparatuses , have been investigated and introduced in order to improve the processes of isolation of ionic species, from liquios. Among those processes and apparatuses are filtration with ultra- and nano-fliters, exchanging ions with ion-exchangers and electrodialysis with electrodialysis cells.<br>
Japanese patent application no. 63335032 discloses a desalting apparatus. The apparatus consists of a donnan dialysis apparatus to desalt a solution and an electric dialysis apparatus for reproducing and re-using an acidic or alkaline solution in the desalting process. The apparatus is not suitable for desalting liquid-containing particles.<br>
US patent no. 5746920 discloses a process for purifying-dairy wastewater. The process comprises first treating the wastewater with base. The treated wastewater is then introduced into a  fermenting tank,  where the lactose<br><br><br><br>
present in the wastewater is fermented to form a broth and lactic acid. The broth is subjected to purification by ion-exchanging and nano-filtration and the purified broth is subjected to bipolar electrodialysis to yield   concentrated acid and base solutions from the purified broth The process according to the US patent is complex and costly to carry out and there is a substantial loss of product during the filtration. Furthermore the process is designed to isolate specific ionic species.<br>
Japanese patent application JP7232038 discloses a method of recovering high concentration alkali from liquid containing alkali utilizing a combination of diffusion dialysis using cation exchange membranes and bipolar electrodialysis. No counter-measures are taken to prevent fouling of ion exchange membranes in the diffusion cell from liquids containing proteinuous material, e.g. fermentation broth. Due to the very low driving force across the cation exchange membrane in the diffusion 20  dialysis cell only a very limited flux can be obtained.<br>
Japanese patent application JP63291608 discloses a system for regenerating acidic waste liquid utilizing a combination of diffusion dialysis using anion exchange<br>
2	5  membranes and bipolar electrodialysis. The flux in the<br>
diffusion cell be low. Moreover impurities such as calcium and magnesium ions would prevent the use of bipolar electrodialysis due to the fact that bipolar membranes are damaged or destroyed by presence of even<br>
30  very small amounts of calcium ox magnesium ions.<br>
German patent no DE 19700044 Cl discloses a method for production of acid and alkaline products by monopolar<br>
3<br><br>
electrodialysis followed by bipolar electrodialysis. The monopolar electrodialysis cannot selectively remove either cations or anions from a liquid, thus lactic acid cannot be removed without removing e.g. calcium, which would cause problems in the bipolar electrodialysis. The conventional monopolar electrodialysis is susceptible to fouling by biological material, proteins, etc.<br>
Due to the drawbacks of the prior art technology there is a need for a method and an apparatus for isolation of ionic species which is able to isolate ionic species from different kinds of liquids and furthermore is cost-effective and results in a high output.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an alternative method and an alternative apparatus for isolation of ionic species from a liquid.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a method and an apparatus for isolation of ionic species which method and apparatus are simple and cost-effective and provide a high output.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a method and an apparatus for isolation of ionic species which method and apparatus can be used for isolation of ionic species in liquids containing solids and particles. The invention is in particular useful for separating ionic species from liquids containing particles of organic material and multivalent inorganic metal ions.<br>
Moreover it is an object of the invention to provide a method and an apparatus for isolation of ionic species<br><br><br><br>
which method and appratus are useful for isolation of ionic species in a liquid containing organic material.<br>
These objects are achieved by the present invention as defined in the claims.<br><br>
By the term ionic species is meant that the species are<br>
in a ionic state. For example when<br>
1 )<br>
dissolved in water it dissociates <br>
ion)and Cl (an-ion). As the ions have a small electric<br>
charge, it is possible to move the ions in an electric<br>
field.<br>
The invention provides a method and an apparatus for l5 separating ionic species from a liquid. By using the invention it is possible to separate ionic species frorri liquids which are highly contaminated/ e.g. with particles. The separation can be performed without any need for a filtration step and it is possible to obtain a high output.<br>
The method according to the invention for isolation of ionic species from a first liquid comprises the steps of:<br>
treating the first liquid in an electro enhanced dialysis cell to transfer the ionic species from the first liquid into a second liquid, and<br>
optionally treating the second liquid in a bipolar electrodialysis cell to transfer the ionic species from the second liquid into a third liquid,<br>
optionally separating the ionic species from the second or third liquid.<br><br><br><br>
The first liquid may be provided to the electro enhancec dialysis cell from a storage tank. In a dialysis cell the ionic species are transferred into a second liquid which    has a pH value differing form the pH value of the first liquid. The difference in pH causes a difference in concentration of K* and OK" in the first and the second liquid. The concentration difference between the first and the second liquid will be the driving forces in the<br>
1) electro enhanced dialysis cell. The difference in concentration will cause a flow of either H+ or OH" ions from the second liquid into the first liquid thereby-building up an electric potential difference or a diffusion potential which will cause either cat-ions (M+)<br>
15 or an-ions (X") of the ionic species to be transported from the first liquid into the second liquid through cat¬ion exchange membranes or an-ion membranes, respectively. If the ionic species are cat-ions, the second liquid will . be acidic compared to the first liquid, and<br>
20  if the ionic species are an-ions. This proce <br>
enhanced by the electro enhanced dialysis cell according to the invention, in which the driving forces have been enhanced by use of an electric field. The electro enhanced dialysis cell will be described in more details<br>
25  in the following.<br>
After treatment in the electro enhanced dialysis cell the second liquid may be treated in a bipolar electrodialysis cell. In the bipolar electrodialysis cell the ionic 0 species will be concentrated. If the ionic species are cat-ions, the third liquid will be basic compared to the second liquid, and (vice_versa,) if the ionic species are an-ions. The driving force in the bipolar electrodialysis <br>
6<br><br>
cell is a difference in electric potential caused by a constant direct current through the cell.<br>
The membranes, acid, bases, and pH can of course be selected depending on the ionic species to be separated. This selection can be done by the skilled person.<br>
When the ionic species are separated and concentrated into the third liquid, it can of course be separated from the third liquid, e.g. to obtain a dry or a substantially dry product.<br>
The method according to the invention comprises the feature of applying an electric field of direct current through the electro enhanced dialysis cell during the treatment of the first liquid. In this way the electric potential difference or diffusion potential is enhanced and thereby increases the number of ionic species which are transferred into the second liquid from the first 2p  liquid.<br>
In order to improve the results from the cell it is preferred to change the direction of the electric field during the treatment of the first liquid. The direction of the electric field is preferably changed by changing the direction of the direct current. By changing the direction of the electric field it is possible to give a "self-cleaning" effect to the membranes used in the electro enhanced dialysis cell and prevent fouling of the membranes during treatment of the first liquid. When an electric field of direct current is applied to the cell electrically loaded particles are driven from the first liquid onto the membrane surfaces of the cell. Here the particles will build up a layer and after a   time cause<br>
7<br><br><br>
fouling which will make the membranes useless. If the electric field is reversed before the particles have caused fouling, the particles will be driven back from the membranes into the first liquid and the membranes will be cleaned.<br>
In an embodiment according to the invention the electric field can be changed at predetermined substantially regular intervals, said intervals preferably being within the range from 5 seconds to 6000 seconds, more preferably within the range from 8 to 1000 seconds and even more preferably within the range from 10 seconds to 360 seconds. More specically the intervals are determined by the nature of the first liquid and the amount and nature of particles present herein.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention for isolation of ionic species stored in a first tank, the method comprises the steps of:<br>
treating the first liquid in an electro enhanced dialysis cell to transfer the ionic species from the first liquid into a second liquid and optionally storing said second liquid in a second tank;<br>
treating the second liquid in a bipolar electrodialysis cell to transfer the ionic species from the second liquio into a third liquid and optionally storing the third liquid in a third tank<br>
  By using a first, a second and a third tank for storing the first liquid, the second liquid and the third liquid,    respectively,  it is possible to obtain better control<br>
8<br><br>
over the processes and optimise the treatment of the liquids in the electro enhanced dialysis cell and the bipolar electrodialysis cell. During the treatment the tanks serve as storage and/or buffers for the treated liquid or the liquid to be treated.<br>
It is preferred that at least a part of the first liquid is recycled to the first tank after treatment in the electro enhanced dialysis cell. The liquid can be recycled via pipelines e.g. supplied with a pump and optionally a purge by which a part of the treated first liquid can be removed and/or replaced by untreated first 1iquid.<br>
Moreover it is preferred that at least a part of the second liquid is recycled to the electro enhanced dialysis cell after being treated in the bipolar electrodialysis cell. The liquid can be recycled via pipelines, e.g. provided with a pump and optionally a purge by which a part of the treated second liquid can be removed and/or replaced.<br>
Furthermore it is preferred that at least a part of the third liquid is recycled from the third tank to the bipolar electrodialysis cell. The third liquid may be recycled directly from the bipolar electrodialysis cell or from the third tank. By recycling the third liquid the ionic species will be concentrated in the liquid. It is possible to achieve very high concentrations in the third liquid. The concentration may be a factor 5 to 10 higher than in the know methods for separating ionic species from a liquid. Like in the previously mentioned recycling circuits pipelines, pumps, and a purge may be used.<br><br><br>
In one preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention, the method further comprises the step of treating the third liquid in an electrodialysis cell to remove undesired ions, e.g. the presence of inorganic ions may be undesired, when you are separating ion of organic species from a liquid.,<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention the method further comprises the step of evaporating and/or crystallising and/or chromatographic treatment of the third liquid to separate the ionic species from the third liquid. By use of this embodiment of the method it is possible to achieve a very pure final product.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the method, the ionic species comprises anions from inorganic acids, organic acids, enzymes, peptides, hormones, antibiotics or amino acids. Moreover the ionic species comprises cat-ions from inorganic bases, organic bases, enzymes, peptides, hormones, antibiotics or amino acids. Thereby the method is useful for a wide range from of liquids containing ionic species. The method may e.g. be used for separating ionic species from streams from metal etching and food processing, including fermentation broth from fermentation of grass juice using strains of Lactobacillus bacteria, wastestream from lactic acid metal etching and waste streams from citrus oil production.<br>
Preferably the ionic species separated according to the invention has a molar weight up to about 1000 g/moi.<br>

l0 Figure 1 shows a schematic drawing of an electro enhanced dialysis cell according to the invention. The cell has two electrodes El and E2, placed in electrode chambers EC1 and EC2, which are placed at opposite ends in the cell. The electrode chambers are separated from the central part of the cell by two end-membranes which in this case are two cat-ion exchange membranes CEM. The two end-membranes have four an-ion exchange membranes AEM placed in between. Thereby the two end-membranes and the four an-ion exchange membranes form five adjacent chambers Cl, C2, C3, C4 and C5.<br>
With this configuration the cell is adapted for separating an-ions X" from a liquid Ll. Liquid Ll is led to the chambers C2 and C4 of the cell. The second liquid L2 which is a base when an-ions are separated, is led to the chambers Cl, C3 and C5 of the cell. The difference in electrical potential between the two liquids is enhanced by a direct current applied by the electrodes El and E2.<br>
30 When the situation is as illustrated in figure.1, where El is the positive electrode, the an-ions X" move in the direction of El and pass through the an-ion exchange membranes from the liquid LI in chambers C2 and C3 to liquid L2 in chambers Cl and C3 as indicated by arrows.<br><br><br>
WO 02/40044		 PCT/DK01/00B10<br>
The an-ions X" from Ll are replaced by hydroxide-ions OH from L2.<br>
When the direction of the direct current is reversed the an-ions X" move in the direction of E2 from the liquid Li in chambers C2 and C4 through the an-ion exchange membranes into the liquid L2 in chambers C3 and C5. Furthermore, if the an-ion exchange membranes have been covered with particles, the an-ion exchange membranes will be cleaned as the particles are caused to move away from the membrane and as hydroxide-ions penetrate the membrane and dissolve the fouling layer.<br>
As it is evident from figure i, when the second liquid L2 is running in chambers on both sides of the chambers, where the first liquid Ll is running, the second liquid L2 will always receive an-ions X" from the first liquid Ll independently of the direction of the electric field.<br>
20 Figure 2 shows a schematic drawing of the bipolar electrodialysis cell according to the invention which is used for further treatment of the second liquid L2 from the electro enhanced dialysis cell. The bipolar electrodialysis cell has an electrode in each end. A positive electrode E+ in the first end and a negative electrode E- in the second end of the cell. Between the electrodes from E+ to E- are placed repeatingly first a bipolar membrane BM, an an-ion exchange membrane AEM and a cat-ion exchange membrane CEM. The stack of membranes forms adjacent chambers Cll, C12, C13, C14, C15 and C16 and is finished with a bipolar membrane before the electrode E-.<br>
22<br><br><br>
WO 02/480-M<br>
In the case where the bipolar electrodialysis cell is used for separating an-ions the second liquid L2 which is basic compared to the third liquid L3, is first sent through the chambers C12 and C15 between an an-ion exchange membrane AEM and a cat-ion exchange membrane CEM. According to the invention the second liquid L2 is further sent through the chambers C13 and C16 between a cat-ion exchange membrane and a bipolar membrane. Hereafter the second liquid is recycled to the electro l0  enhanced dialysis cell.<br>
The third liquid L3 which is acidic ' compared to the second liquid L2, is sent through chambers Cll and C14 between a bipolar membrane and an-ion exchange membrane.<br>
1 5<br>
Due to the constant electric direct current through the cell, the ions (X", M, OH" and H4) are drawn in directions transversely to the membrane stack as indicated with arrows. The an-ions X are together with hydrogen-ions H+ concentrated in the third liquid L3 in chambers Cll and C14.<br>
It is clear that in case the bipolar electrodialysis cell is used for separating cat-ions from the second liquid 25 L2, the second liquid will be sent through the chambers C12 and C15 between an an-ion exchange membrane and a cat-ion exchange membrane and further through chambers Cll and C14 between an an-ion-exchange membrane and a bipolar membrane.<br>
Figure 3a shows a flow sheet of the method according to the invention. The first tank Tl contains the first liquid Ll which is fed to the electro enhanced dialysis cell EEC and treated herein. Hereafter the first liquid<br>
23<br><br>
WO 02/18011		■ PCT/DK01/00810<br>
is recycled to the tank Tl. In the electro enhanced dialysis cell EEC the ionic species are transferred from the first liquid Ll into the second liquid L2. After treatment in the electro enhanced dialysis cell EEC, the second liquid L2 is first stored in a tank T2, before it is treated in the bipolar electrodialysis cell EDBM. After the treatment in the bipolar electrodialysis cell EDBM the second liquid L2 is recycled to the electro enhanced dialysis cell EEC. The third liquid L3 is 10) treated ind the bipolar electrodialysis cell EDBM where the third liquid L3 receives the ionic species from the second liquid L2 . After treatment in the bipolar electrodialysis cell EDBM the third liquid L3 is stored in a tank T3 and recycled trough the bipolar electrodialysis cell until a satisfactory concentration of the ionic species is obtained in the third liquid L3.<br>
In the process it is preferred that e.g. three tanks are used parallel for storing the third liquid L3 from the bipolar electrodialysis cell EDBM. During the process one tank T3 is open for receiving the third liquid L3 and recycle it to the bipolar electrodialysis cell EDBM. The third liquid L3 in the two other tanks is optionally submitted to the processes shown in figures 3b and 3c.<br>

Example 2<br>
Description of experimental extraction through a Electro enhanced Dialysis cell according to the invention<br>
In the electro enhanced dialysis cell, the cell stack was configured with four amon-exchange membranes 1 (Neosepta AMX, Tokuyama Corp., Japan) and two cation-exchange 10) membranes 2 (Neosepta CMR, Tokuyama Corp., Japan) as shown in figure 4. The effective membrane area was 40 cm-.<br>
In the two end-chambers 3 between the platinum electrodes 6 and 1 (each 31.5 cm) and each cation-exchange membrane, a flow of electrode-rinsing solution was maintained in the end-chambers. The solution was an aqueous solution of 0.1M KrSO4.<br>
) Through the chambers 4, 250 ml of an aqueous alkaline solution of 0.5M KOH (pK 12.5) was pumped from a storage container, to which the solution was returned after each passage. The volume flow was 10 g/s. The thickness of the chambers 4 between the membranes was 6 mm. Net spacers 25  was introduced to promote turbulent flow.<br>
Through the chambers 5, 250 ml of the feed solution, which was fermented brown juice from grass pellet production with around 16 g/1 lactic acid, was passed from a storage container. The treated feed solution was returned to the container after each pass. The fermented solution had initially been adjusted to a pH-value of 5.5<br>
25<br><br>
by adding KOH pellets. Nothing else had been done to the broth. The volume flow was 10 g/s. The thickness of the chambers 5 was 12 mm. No spacers were introduced in these chambers. ■ J<br>
Each chamber 4 and 5 had a   10 cm long flow-path that was 4 cm wide.<br>
The temperature of the electrode-rinse, the alkaline and 10  the fermented solutions was held constant at 40 degrees Celsius during the experiment.<br>
During the experiment, the pH was continuously measured in the fermented solution and held constant at pH 5.5 by 15  titration of more fermented solution (pH 2) with a high lactic acid concentration (70 g/1).<br>
In the middle of each of the chambers 5, a silver/silver chloride electrode was placed, so the voltage drop across 20 a cell pair could be continuously measured by date collection (Fluke 123 - Industrial Scopemeter, Fluke Corporation, USA).<br>
When the experiment was started, the electrode-rinse, the 25 fermented broth and the alkaline solution was pumped through the cell. Direct current across the cell was added by a power supply (EA-PS 3032-10 (0 . . 32V/0. .10A), EA-Elektro-Automatik, Germany) that regulates the power to uphold a constant current of 1.0 A. An IBM personal 30 computer controlled a relay, shifting the direction of the electrical current every 10 seconds.<br>
26<br><br>
WO 02/18014		-PCT/DK()]/00810<br>
Samples from the fermentation broth and the alkaline solution were taken every 30 minutes. pH and conductivity were noted, and lactic content was measured by HPLC using an AMINEX HPX-87H column (Biorad, USA) at 35 degrees Celsius using 4 mM sulfuric acid as eiuent.<br>
After 4 hours, the alkaline solution was replaced by a fresh solution, and the experiment was continued.<br>
10 Figure 5 shows the concentration profile of lactic acid in the feed and alkaline solutions during an eight-hour experiment. In the fermented brown juice, the initial lactic acid concentration of 16 g/1 goes up during the experiment, because pH is regulated by titration of fermentation solution having higher lactic acid content. The alkaline solution was replaced after four hours to simulate the regeneration process in the EDBM process.<br>
The lactate flux was found to be 1.2.10-4 mol/nrs during the first four hours, and 1.7-10-4 mol/nrs during the next four hours. Some of this increase might originate from the rising lactate concentration in the feed.<br>
Figures 6 and 7 show the potential drop across a cell pair at the beginning and at the end of the first four-hour run, respectively. The 10 second intervals were evident as the direction of current changes between positive and negative potential drops. At the beginning of each interval, both figures show an almost constant 30 initial drop that in figure 3 increases slightly and in figure 4 increases significantly during the 10 seconds. These increments relate to the increase of electrical<br>
27<br><br>
03/4W44		TCT/DKQI/OOBIO<br>
resistance partly from ionic polarization, but also from a build-up of organic matter on the membrane surface in the feed chamber.<br>
Especially figure 8 shows that the organic fouling can be removed by changing the direction of the electric current. The reversal does not remove the organic matter completely, as an increase in initial cell-resistance from about 1.5 Ohm to 2 Ohm was evident during the experiment.<br>
The divergence between the form of the positive and negative potential drop in figure 8 must derive from different flow conditions in the two feed chambers in the laboratory equipment.<br>
Example 3<br>
The electro enhanced dialysis cell was configured as in example 1 but the AMX anion-exchanqe membrane was replaced with a monoseiective anion-exchange membrane (Neosepta ACS, Tokuyama Corp., Japan) .<br>
500 ml brown juice was circulated in the feed chambers and the pH was held constant at 5.5 by titration of lactic acid. In the base chambers 500 ml of 0.5 M KOH was passed and 500 mi 0.1 M K:S04 was used as electrode rinsing solution.<br>
Samples were taken at 0, 60, and 120 min. from the feed and  base  streams  and  the  contents  of  calcium  and<br>
28<br><br>
02/48044		'PCT/DK01/00810<br><br>
magnesium were determined by Atom Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) .<br><br>
From these results, it is evident that divalent cations are retained sufficiently to be non-damaging in the following EDBM process which usually requires such concentrations to be lower than 2 ppm.<br>
Using a mono-selective anion-exchange membrane	in this<br>
experiment  does  not  affect  retention  of	cations<br>
significantly, but does improve retention of	divalent<br>
anions such as sulfate and phosphate.<br>
Example 4<br>
In the experiments with the bipolar electrodialysis cell, the cell was equipped with three bipolar membranes 8 in figure 8 (Neosepta BP-1, Tokuyama Corp., Japan), two anion-exchange membranes 1 (Neosepta AMX, Tokuyama Corp., Japan) and two cation-exchange membranes 2 (Neosepta CMH, Tokuyama Corp., Japan) as shown on figure 8.<br>
In the two end-chambers 3 between the platinum electrodes 6 and 7 (each 31.5 cm2) and a set of bipolar membranes, a flow of electrode-rinsing solution was established. The electrode-rinsing solution was an aqueous solution of 0.1M K2SO4 Through the feed chambers 9 between the anion-exchange membrane and the cation exchange membrane<br>
29<br><br>
WO 02/48044		<br><br>
500 ml of a mixture of 0.5 M KOH and 0.4 M lactic acid was circulated to a container. 1000 ml of an alkaline 0.1 M KOH solution was circulated in both the acid chamber 10 between the bipolar membrane and the anion-exchange membrane and in the base chamber 11 between the bipolar membrane and the cation-exchange membrane. The streams from the acid and base chambers 10 and 11 were mixed in a container after each pass. The thickness of the chambers 9, 1C, and 11 between the membranes was 6 MM. Net spacers were introduced to promote turbulent flow.<br>
The temperature of the electrode-rinse, the feed and the base solutions was held constant at 40 degrees Celsius during the experiment.<br>
In the feed chambers 2, silver/silver chloride electrodes were placed so the voltage drop across a cell pair could be continuously measured and data collected (Fluke 123 -Industrial Scopemeter, Fluke Corporation, USA) . Samples from the feed and the alkaline solution were taken every 30 minutes. pH and conductivity were noted, and lactic content was measured by HPLC using an AMINEX HPX-87K column (Biorad, USA) at 35 degrees Celsius using 4 mM sulfuric acid as eluent.<br>
25<br>
Figure 9 shows the transport of lactate from the feed stream to the combined acid and base stream, reaching a lactate concentration of 0.8 g/1 in the feed stream after 180 min., corresponding to more than 97% acid recovery.<br>
Figure 10 shows the pK and conductivity in the feed solution during the experiment as well as the current<br>
30<br><br>
WO 02/180 11		-PCT7DKO1/()0ttlO-<br>
efficiency,	and       corresponding        effect        on       energy<br>
consumption.	It   is   clear   that   the   significant   decrease   in<br>
conductivity	near   the   end  of   the   experiment  was  causing   a<br>
rise   in  cell	resistance   and  thus   energy  consumption.<br><br>
The current efficiency was above 80% during most of the experiment, except for the beginning and final part. The low efficiency in the final phase probably originates from polarization, leading to ineffective water-splitting 10  at the mono-polar membranes.<br>
Example 5<br>
Another experiment with a bipolar electrodialysis cell 15      was carried out exactly as example 4, except the 500 M] feed mixture was composed of 0.5M KOH, 0.1M (0.3N) citric acid, and 0.05M (0.1N) malic acid.<br>
The acid content of the samples was measured by HPLC as 20  before.<br>
Figure 11 shows the concentration profiles of the citric and malic acid in the feed solution and the mixed acid/base solution.<br>
From figure 11 it is evident that most of the citric and malic  acid  is  extracted from the  feed  solution.  The recovery of both citric and malic acid was higher than 97%. 30<br>
However, the recovery of the last 5-10% of the organic acids is very costly, as can be seen in figure 12. As pH<br>
31<br><br>
WO 02/M80-H		PCT/DK01/00810<br><br>
and conductivity in the feed decrease, cell resistance and thus energy consumption increase drastically.<br>
Example 6<br>
The electro enhanced dialysis cell stack was configured as in example 1, but with A cation-exchange membranes (Neosepta CMB, Tokuyama Corp., Japan) replacing the amon-exchange membranes and (Neosepta AMX, Tokuyama 10 Corp., Japan) membranes replacing the cation-exchange membranes.<br>
250 ml aqueous solution of 0.2 M glycine, which is an amino acid with and p3 = 5.97,<br>
was circulated in the feed chambers. In the dialysate chambers 1750 ml of 0. 1M H-SO4 was circulated and 500 mi 0.1 M Na2SO4 was used as electrode rinsing solution. The concentration of glycine was determined using HPLC. The liquids were circulated for 5 min. before the experiment 20 was started. Current reversal was omitted as the feed stream did not contain material that could cause fouling of the membranes.<br><br>
25<br><br>
Figure 13 shows the concentration of glycine in the feed and dialysate during the experiment. At the beginning of the experiment glycine is transported from the feed stream to the dialysate stream at a relatively low rate because the starting pH is close to the isoelectric point of the amino acid. The voltage drop across a cell pair was not allowed to exceed 14 V, which resulted in a current starting very low and slowly increasing as pK went down and conductivity increased in the feed, see<br><br>
32<br><br>
WO 02/48(H-l	pCT/DK01/00810<br>
figure 14. Within 180 min. 84% of the glycine is removed from the feed at a current efficiency of 58%.<br>
Example 7<br>
The electro enhanced dialysis cell stack was configured as in example 5.<br>
250 ml aqueous solution consisting of 50 g/1 bakers yeast l0 and 0.2 M lysine, which at the experimental conditions was a positively charged amino acid, was circulated in the feed chambers. In the dialysate chambers 1750 ml of 0.1M H2SO4 was circulated and 500 ml 0.1 M Na2S04 was used as electrode rinsing solution. The liquids were circulated for 5 min. before the experiment was started.<br>
Direct current  across the cell was added	by a power<br>
supply   (EA-PS   9072-040   (0 . . 72V/0. .40A) ,	EA-Elektro-<br>
Automatik,  Germany)  regulating  the  power	to  keep  a<br>
constant current of 1.0 A. The concentration	of lysine is<br>
determined using HPLC.<br>
Without current reversal the experiment had to be terminated as the voltage drop across a single cell pair increased from 10V to 30 V during the first 8 minutes in order to keep a current of 1 A (25 mA/cm2)<br>
When the experiment was repeated with a current reversal time of 300 sec, it was possible to keep the average 30) voltage drop across a cell pair at approx. 15 V. Figure 15 shows the concentration of lysine in the feed and diaiysate during the experiment. During the first 60 min.<br>
