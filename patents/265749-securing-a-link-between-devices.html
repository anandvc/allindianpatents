				<td>SECURING A LINK BETWEEN DEVICES<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0001]        In general, wireless communication is insecure and vulnerable to attacks. Various techniques may be employed to secure a wireless communication link or to make it less vulnerable to attacks. For example, cryptographic techniques may be employed to secure a wireless communication link. In symmetric-key systems (also known as "secret-key systems"), a single, common cryptographic key is stored by two communication devices. In public-key systems (also known as "public-private pair systems"), each communication device stores its own private key and freely distributes its own public key.<br>
[0002]        Various security concerns exist with the use of cryptographic techniques. For example, secrets need to be shared between the two communication devices in a secure and authenticated manner. Especially in the case of mobile devices, it may be desirable to have only those two devices know the secret and not require the intervention/involvement of an Information Technology (IT) administrator. Also, it may be desirable to verify that the devices share a secret without exposing that secret to others, and to use the secret to generate a key to secure a communication link between the devices.<br>
[0003]        US2002/076054 discloses how a public key used for creating a session shared key is inserted into a packet transmitted by a wireless terminal to an access point based on a DHCP. A public key used for creating the session shared key is inserted into a packet transmitted by the access point to the wireless terminal based on the DHCP. The access point creates the session shared key based on the public key and the wireless terminal creates the session shared key based on the public key. As a result, it becomes possible to safely share the session shared key K for privacy and/or authentication between the wireless terminal and the access point.<br>
[0004]        US2004/184606 discloses a method for permitting encrypted communications between two stations which are operable with encryption algorithms that accept encryption keys having work factors with different values.<br>

[0014]        Figure 6 is a block diagram of the exemplary system of Figure 1.<br>
[0015]        It will be appreciated that for simplicity and clarity of illustration, elements shown in the figures have not necessarily been drawn to scale. For example, the dimensions of some of the elements may be exaggerated relative to other elements for clarity.<br>
device 102 are encrypted using a symmetric algorithm with a random session key generated by the sender of the e-mail message. The e-mail message also includes the session key, encrypted using the public key of the recipient. Upon receipt of an encrypted e-mail message, mobile device 102 may extract the encrypted session key and send it to smart card reader 104 via communication link 106. Smart card reader 104 may send the encrypted session key to smart card 108, and the decryption engine of smart card 108 may decrypt the encrypted session key using the recipient's private decryption key, which is stored in smart card 108. Smart card reader 104 may retrieve the decrypted session key from smart card 108 and forward it to mobile device 102 via communication link 106 so that mobile device 102 can decrypt the received e-mail message. The smart card 108 may prevent unauthorized use of the recipient's private decryption key by requiring that a password or personal identification number (PIN) be supplied before allowing the decryption operation to proceed.<br>
[0020]        Similarly, to add a digital signature to an e-mail message being sent by mobile device 102, mobile device 102 may send a hash of the contents of the e-mail message to smart card reader 104 over communication link 106. Smart card reader 104 may pass the hash to smart card 108, which may produce a digital signature from the hash and the sender's private signing key, which is stored in smart card 108. Smart card 108 may then pass the digital signature to smart card reader 104, which may forward it to mobile device 102 via communication link 106 so that mobile device 102 can transmit it along with the e-mail message to the e-mail server. Again, smart card 108 may prevent unauthorized use of the recipient's private signing key by requiring that a password or PIN be supplied before allowing the signing operation to proceed.<br>
[0021]        The unencrypted session key should be sent securely over communication link 106 from smart card reader 104 to mobile device 102 to prevent a third party from retrieving the session key from communication link 106. Similarly, the hash to be signed should be sent authentically over communication link 106 from smart card reader 104 to mobile device 102 to prevent a third party from modifying the hash and thereby causing smart card 108 to produce a signature using a hash different from the hash of the intended message. Smart card reader 104 and mobile device 102 may each store a common, symmetric key and use a symmetric algorithm to secure communications over communication link 106. Alternatively, smart card reader 104 and mobile device 102 may<br><br>
store their own private keys and each other's public keys, and use an asymmetric algorithm combined with a symmetric algorithm to secure communications over communication link 106.<br>
[0022]        In order to establish the symmetric key used to secure communications over communication link 106, mobile device 102 and smart card reader 104 may use the following method, as illustrated in the flowchart of Figure 2, to which reference is additionally made.<br>
[0023]        At 202, a link between mobile device 102 and smart card reader 104 is established. This link may be, for example, wireless communication link 106.<br>
[0024]        At 204, a short secret S is established locally at mobile device 102 and smart card reader 104. Any method to establish the short secret S securely and authentically is suitable. By "locally", it is meant that the establishment of this secret does not require any involvement or intervention by an Information Technology (IT) administrator. Moreover, since the user of mobile device 102 and smart card reader 104 will perform the method of Figure 2 on an as-needed basis, the establishment of the secret ought to be a simple procedure. An exemplary method to establish the short secret S using a display 110 is described hereinbelow with respect to Figure 3.<br>
[0025] Establishing the connection between mobile device 102 and smart card reader 104 may occur before, after or concurrently with establishing the short secret S locally on mobile device 102 and smart card reader 104.<br>
[0026]        Once the connection between mobile device 102 and smart card reader 104 has been established and the short secret S has been established locally on mobile device 102 and smart card reader 104, a "bootstrapping" process to generate a strong secret from the short secret S is initiated at 206. For example, the short secret S may originate at smart card reader 104, and once it has been shared with mobile device 102, mobile device 102 may initiate the bootstrapping process by sending an appropriate message (or just a packet) to smart card reader 104 over communication Unit 106.<br>
[0027]        The bootstrapping process involves at least one public key algorithm, at least one symmetric key algorithm, at least one hashing function, and any other security or non-security related information such as a compression algorithm. A non-exhaustive list of examples of public key algorithms includes Diffie-Hellman (DH) on a large prime-order<br>
finite group and DH on an elliptical curve (EC) group. At 208, mobile device 102 requests from smart card reader 104 a list of its supported algorithms. At 210, smart card reader 104 sends a list of its supported algorithms to mobile device 102.<br>
[0028]        At 212, mobile device 102 selects the algorithms to be used in the subsequent steps of the method and sends an indication of the selected algorithms to smart card reader 104. The selected algorithms include:<br>
a)	one or two selected public key algorithms (e.g. the parameters or the name of the<br>
elliptic curve group, or the prime and generator of the large prime-order finite group);<br>
b)	a selected symmetric key algorithm (e.g. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and<br>
the key size, or Triple Data Encryption Standard (DES), or the like); and<br>
c)	a selected hash function (e.g., Message Digest 5 (MD5), Secure Hashing Algorithm 1<br>
(SHA-1), SHA-256, or the like).<br>
[0029]        At 214, mobile device 102 and smart card reader 104 each generate the same symmetric key Kl from the short secret S, as described in further detail hereinbelow with respect to Figure 4. At 216, mobile device 102 and smart card reader 104 each generate the same symmetric key K2, as described in further detail hereinbelow with respect to Figure 5. Generating symmetric key Kl may occur before, after or concurrently with generating symmetric key K2.<br>
[0030]        At 216, mobile device 102 and smart card reader 104 each hash all the packets sent and received during the generation of symmetric keys Kl and K2 to produce the hash result H. For example, the selected hash function may be applied to the packets as the packets are sent and received, so that this is concurrent with generating the symmetric keys Kl and K2. In another example, the packets may be stored in a buffer and then the selected hash function may be applied to the packets after the symmetric keys Kl and K2 have been generated.<br>
[0031]        Once symmetric keys Kl and K2 have been generated, and mobile device 102 and smart card reader 104 have produced the hash result H, mobile device 102 and smart card reader 104 each generate the same symmetric key K3 from Kl, K2 and the hash result H. For example, the selected hash function may be used to combine keys Kl and K2 and the hash result H into K3.<br>
 [0032]        Symmetric key K3 may then be used to secure communications over communication link 106.<br>
[0033]        Reference is now made to Figure 3, which is a flowchart of an exemplary method for establishing a secret between two devices, according to some embodiments of the invention. At 302, a user may press a button 112 (Figure 1) or other suitable input component of smart card reader 104, which will cause the short secret S, for example, "15379258", to be shown on display 110 of smart card reader 104 at 304. At 306, a user may open an appropriate application on mobile device 102. Causing the short secret S to be shown on display 110 may occur before, after or concurrently with opening the appropriate application on mobile device 102.<br>
[0034]        Once the short secret S has been shown on display 110 and the appropriate application has been opened on mobile device 102, the user may copy the short secret S to the application on mobile device 102 at 308 using an input component of mobile device 102, for example a keyboard 114. As illustrated in Figure 1, the user has entered the first 3 digits of the 8-digit passphrase that is the short secret S. Although this example uses a numerical value for short secret S, any type of value may be used providing the value can be shown in display 110 and inputted using the input component of mobile device 102. Since the short secret S is short, it is simple for the user to copy the secret to the application on mobile device 102. However, the short secret S is too short to be suitable for use as a reliable symmetric key. Copying the short secret S to the application on mobile device 102 may result in mobile device 102 initiating the bootstrapping process (an example of block 206 of Figure 2) at 310, for example, by sending an appropriate message (or just a packet) to smart card reader 104 over communication link 106.<br>
[0035]        To protect the short secret S from prying eyes, at 312, smart card reader 104 may clear display 110 once smart card reader 104 receives the message or packet sent by mobile device 102 to initiate the bootstrapping process.<br>
[0036]        Smart card reader 104 may also implement a timeout, and if, as checked at 314, the message or packet initiating the bootstrapping process has not been received by smart card reader 104 within the predefined period of time, which may be calculated, for example, from the time that the secret S is first shown on display 110, smart card reader 104 may clear display 110.<br>
[0037]        Once smart card reader 104 has cleared display 110, smart card reader 104 may optionally show a non-confidential (possibly random) value on display 110 so that a snooper looking at display 110 will not know whether the value on display 110 is the secret or not.<br>
[0038]        Reference is now made to Figure 4, which is a flowchart of an exemplary method for generating symmetric key K1 from the short secret S. The method of Figure 4 is based on the simplified password-based exponential key exchange (SPEKE) method described in U.S. Patent No. 6,226,383 to Jablon. All variations of the SPEKE method are suitable for generating symmetric key Kl from the short secret S.<br>
[0039]        The method includes a portion 400 to be implemented by mobile device 102 and a portion 410 to be implemented by smart card reader 104. At 402, mobile device 102 has possession of the secret S and one of the selected public key algorithms. For example, if the selected public key algorithm for generating symmetric key Kl is DH on a large prime-order finite group for a particular prime p, the function/, when applied to the secret S, results in a generator of the group. U.S. Patent No. 6,226,383 discusses factors to consider when selecting function/ Similarly, at 412, smart card reader 104 has possession of the secret S and the selected public key algorithm for generating symmetric key Kl .<br>
[0040]        At 404, mobile device 102 generates a random number RA in the range of 2 to p-l . Then at 406, mobile device 102 generates a short-term public key P1by raising the<br>
generator f(S) to the power RA within the group and sends public key P1 to smart card<br>
reader 104. In the example of DH on the large prime-order finite group for p, this is calculated as follows:<br>
P1=f(S)RA<br>
[0041]        Similarly, at 414, smart card reader 104 generates a random number RB in the range of 2 to p-1 . Then at 416, smart card reader 104 generates a short-term public key P2<br>
by raising the generatorf(S) to the power RQ within the group and sends public key P2 to<br>
mobile device 102. In the example of DH on the large prime-order finite group for P, this is calculated as follows:<br>
P=f(S)RB modp<br>
[0042]        Generating the random number KB at smart card reader 104 and generating public key P2 and sending it to mobile device 102 may occur before, after or concurrently<br>
with generating the random number .RA at mobile device 102 and generating public key P1 and sending it to smart card reader 104.<br>
[0043]        Once mobile device 102 has generating the random number RA  and has<br>
received public key P2, mobile device 102 generates a symmetric key Kl at 408. In the example of DH on the large prime-order finite group forP, the symmetric key Kl is calculated as follows:<br>
Kl=P2  RA modp=f(S) R B RA modp<br>
[0044]        Once smart card reader 104 has generating the random number KB and has<br>
received public key P1, smart card reader 104 generates the symmetric key Kl at 418. In<br>
the example of DH on the large prime-order finite group for p, the symmetric key Kl is calculated as follows:<br>
A B modp<br>
[0045]        Since the operations on the elements of the group are commutative, the two calculations (at mobile device 102 and smart card reader 104) yield the same symmetric key. Generating the symmetric key Kl at mobile device 102 may occur before, after or concurrently with generating the symmetric key Kl at smart card reader 104.<br>
[0046]        Reference is now made to Figure 5, which is a flowchart of an exemplary method for generating symmetric key K2. The method of Figure 5 is based on well-known Diffie-Hellman exponential key exchange techniques.<br>
[0047]        The method includes a portion 500 to be implemented by mobile device 102 and a portion 510 to be implemented by smart card reader 104. At 502, mobile device 102 has possession of one of the selected public key algorithms, which may be the same as or different from the selected public key algorithm used to generate symmetric key KI. For<br>
example, if the selected public key algorithm for generating symmetric key K2 is DH on a large prime-order finite group for a particular prime P, mobile device 102 has possession of a known, published generator T of the group. Similarly, at 512, smart card reader 104 has possession of the selected public key algorithm for generating symmetric key K2.<br>
[0048]        At 504, mobile device 102 generates a random number RC in the range of 2 to p-1. Then at 506, mobile device 102 generates a short-term public key P3 by raising the generator T to the power RC within the group and sends public key P3 to smart card reader<br>
104. In the example of DH on the large prime-order finite group for p, this is calculated as follows:<br>
mod p<br>
[0049]        Similarly, at 514, smart card reader 104 generates a random number RD in the range of 2 to p-1. Then at 516, smart card reader 104 generates a short-term public key P4 by raising the generator T to the power RDwithin the group and sends public key P4 to<br>
mobile device 102. In the example of DH on the large prime-order finite group for P, this is calculated as follows:<br>
P4 = T D mod p<br>
[0050]        Generating the random number RD at smart card reader 104 and generating public key P4 and sending it to mobile device 102 may occur before, after or concurrently with generating the random number RC at mobile device 102 and generating public key P3 and sending it to smart card reader 104.<br>
[0051]        Once mobile device 102 has generating the random number RC and has<br>
received public key P4, mobile device 102 generates a symmetric key K2 at 508. In the example of DH on the large prime-order finite group for p, the symmetric key K2 is calculated as follows:<br>
K2 = P4Rc mod/? = 7RD C mod  P<br>
 [0052]        Once smart card reader 104 has generating the random number RD and has<br>
received public key P3, smart card reader 104 generates the symmetric key K2 at 518. In the example of DH on the large prime-order finite group for p, the symmetric key K2 is calculated as follows:<br>
K2 = P3  D mod p = T      D mod p<br>
[0053]        Since the operations on the elements of the group are commutative, the two calculations (at mobile device 102 and smart card reader 104) yield the same symmetric key. Generating the symmetric key K2 at mobile device 102 may occur before, after or concurrently with generating the symmetric key K2 at smart card reader 104.<br>
[0054]        Figure 6 is a block diagram of system 100, according to some embodiments of the invention. For clarity, some components of mobile device 102 and smart card reader 104 are not shown in Figure 6 and are not described explicitly below.<br>
[0055]        Mobile device 102 includes an antenna 602 and smart card reader 104 includes an antenna 622. A non-exhaustive list of examples for antennae 602 and 622 includes dipole antennae, monopole antennae, multilayer ceramic antennae, planar inverted-F antennae, loop antennae, shot antennae, dual antennae, omnidirectionale antenna and any other suitable antennae.<br>
[0056]        Mobile device 102 also includes a communication interface 604 coupled to antenna 602. Smart card reader 104 includes a communication interface 624 coupled to antenna 604. A non-exhaustive list of examples for standards with which communication interfaces 604 and 624 may be compatible includes 802.11 a, b, g and n and future related standards, the Bluetooth® standard, the Zigbee™ standard and the like.<br>
[0057]        Mobile device 102 also includes a processor 606 coupled to communication interface 604 and to keyboard 114. Mobile device 102 also includes a memory 608, which may be fixed in or removable from mobile device 102. Memory 608 may be coupled to processor 606 or partly embedded in processor 606.
