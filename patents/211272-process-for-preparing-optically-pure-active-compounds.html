3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br>
Process for preparing optically pure active compounds<br>
Subject-matter of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for preparing optically pure active compounds which can be used for preparing medicaments in the pharmaceutical industry.<br>
Technical background<br>
Pyridin-2-ylmethylsulphinyl-l H-benzimidazoles and compounds of a closely related structure, as known, for example, from EP-A-0005129, EP-A-0166287, EP-A-0174726 and EP-A-0268956, are, owing to their H+/K+-ATPase-inhibitory action, of considerable importance in the therapy of diseases associated with an increased secretion of gastric acid.<br>
Examples of active compounds from this class of compounds which are commercially available or in clinical development are 5-methoxy-2- [ (4-methoxy-3, 5-dimethyi-2-pyridinyl) methyIsulphinyl]-lH-benzimidazole (INN : omeprazole), (S)-5-methoxy-2- [ (4-methoxy-3, 5-dimethyl-2- pyridinyl) methylsulphinyl]-lH-benzimidazole (1NN : esomeprazole), 5-difluoromethoxy-2- [ (3, 4-dim- ethoxy-2-pyridinyl) methylsulphinyl]-1H-benzimidazole (INN : pantoprazole), 2- [3-methyl-4- (2, 2,2-trifluoroethoxy)-2-pyridinyl) methylsulphinyl]-lH-benzimidazole (INN : lansoprazole), 2- { [4- (3-methoxypropoxy)-3-methylpyridin-2-yl] methylsulphinyl}-1 H-benzimidazole (INN : rabeprazole) and 5-methoxy-2- ( (4-methoxy-3, 5-dimethyl-2-pyridylmethyl) sulphinyl)-lH-imidazo (4,5-b) pyridine (INN : tenatoprazole).<br>
The abovementioned sulphinyl derivatives which, owing to their mechanism of action, are also referred to as proton pump inhibitors or abbreviated PP1 are chiral compounds. The process usually used for preparing the PPI is the oxidation of the corresponding sulphides. This oxidation gives-unless particular measures are taken-a racemic mixture comprising about the same proportions of the two enantiomers (stereoisomers), i. e. the (+) -and (-) -form or the (R) -and (S) -form of the PPI. Since enantiomers are thermally relatively stable, i. e. they do not racemize on storage-in particular in solid form-there has in the past been no lack of efforts to separate PPI enantiomer mixtures or to prepare the PPI enantiomers in more or less pure form.<br>
Prior art<br>
The international patent application W091/12221 describes a process for separating enantiomers<br>
using a cellulase enzyme. One of the active compounds mentioned as being separable into the<br>
enatiomers with the aid of this process is omeprazole.<br>
The international patent application WO92/08716 describes, for the first time, a chemical process<br>
which allows the separation of pyridin-2-ylmethylsulphinyI-l H-benzimidazoles into their optical<br>
isomers.<br>
2<br><br>
Compounds mentioned as having been prepared  in an exemplary manner are,  inter alia, the<br>
compounds  (+)-and  {-)-5-difluoromethoxy-2-  [(3,  4-dimethoxy-2-pyridinyl)  methylsulphinyl]-lH-<br>
benzimidazole [= (+) -and (-)-pantoprazole]. The international patent application WO92/087I6 refers<br>
to the fact that the optical isomers of the pyridin-2-yl-methylsulphinyl-l H-benzimidazoles, i. e. the<br>
(+)-and (-)- enantiomers or the (R) -and (S) -enantiomers, are  used as active compounds  in<br>
medicaments for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. With respect to the mode of application<br>
and the dosage of the active compounds, reference is made inter alia to the European patent 166 287.<br>
The international patent application W094/27988 describes the separation of racemic omeprazole into<br>
the enantiomers, using chiral auxiliaries.<br>
The international patent application WO96/02535 (= USP 5, 948, 789) describes a process for the<br>
enantioselective synthesis of PP1 using chiral titanium complexes. What is described is, inter aiia, the<br>
synthesis of (+) -and (-) - [or, expressed in a different way, (R)-and (S)]-pantoprazole, the chiral<br>
auxiliary used for the synthesis of (+)- pantoprazole being diethyl (+) - tartrate and the chiral auxiliary<br>
used for the preparation of (-)- pantoprazole being diethyl (-) - tartrate.<br>
The international patent applications WO96/17076 and WO96/17077 describe the enantioselective<br>
biooxidation or bioreduction  with  the  use  of certain  microorganisms for the preparation of<br>
enantiomerically pure or enantiomerically enriched PPI.<br>
The international patent application WO97/02261 describes the enrichment of PPI enantiomers by<br>
selective precipitation.<br>
The international patent applications WO94/24867 and WO94/25028 claim the use of the compounds<br>
(-) -and (+)-pantoprazole for treating stomach disorders in humans. Each of the stereoisomers is said<br>
to have medical advantages compared to the respective other stereoisomers.<br>
The enantioselective sulphoxidation for preparing esomeprazole {(S)-omeprazole) on a large scale<br>
using a chiral titanium complex is described in Tetrahedron, Asymmetry, (2000), 11,3819-3825.<br>
The enantioselective sulphoxidation of ary! alkyl sulphides and dialkyl sulphides in the presence of a<br>
zirconium catalyst having a polydentate ligand is described in J. Org. Chem., (1999), 64 (4), 1327.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
The invention provides a process for preparing optically pure PPI having a sulphinyl structure. The process is characterized in that the oxidation of the corresponding sulphide is carried out in the presence of a chiral zirconium complex or a chiral hafnium complex, the chiral auxiliary used being an optically pure tartaric acid derivative.<br>
The oxidation is advantageously carried out in an organic solvent, such as, for example, ethyl acetate, toluene, dichloromethane, dioxane or, preferably, methyl isobutyl ketone, where it is not necessary for the solvents mentioned to be completely anhydrous or where anhydrous solvents are in each case optionally admixed with a defined proportion of water, for example up to a maximum of 0.5 equivalent.<br>
3<br><br>
For reactions with less than 0.5 equivalent of zirconium or hafnium complex, it is preferred to use an anhydrous solvent. The solvents employed may be used in the commercially available quality. A solvent essentially comprises a specific solvent if it contains at least 50%, preferably at least 90%, in particular at least 95%, of said specific solvent. An anhydrous solvent is essentially free of water, having a water content of less than 5%, preferably less than 1 %, in particular less than 0.3%. Suitable oxidizing agents are all anhydrous oxidizing agents customarily used for the synthesis of PPI, where particular mention may be made of hydroperoxides, such as, for example, tert-butyl hydroperoxide or, in particular, cumene hydroperoxide. In general, 0.90 to 1.3 oxidation equivalents, preferably 0.95-1.05 equivalents, of the oxidizing agent are used.<br>
Suitable zirconium complexes are, for example, zirconium (IV) acetylacetonate, zirconium (IV) butoxide, zirconium (IV) tert-butoxide, zirconium (IV) ethoxide and, in particular, zirconium (IV) n-propoxide (preferably as a solution in n-propanol) or zirconium (IV) isopropoxide (preferably in the form of the zirconium (IV) isopropoxide/isopropanol complex). Suitable hafnium complexes are, for example, hafnium (IV) acetylacetonate, hafnium (IV) butoxide, hafnium (IV) n-propoxide, hafnium (IV) isopropoxide (preferably in the form of the hafnium (IV) isopropoxide/isopropanol complex), hafnium (IV) ethoxide and in particular hafnium (IV) tert-butoxide. Preference is given to using a zirconium complex.<br>
In general, 0,01-2 equivalents, preferably 0.05-0.9 equivalent, of the zirconinum complex or of the hafnium complex are used.<br>
Suitable optically pure tartaric acid derivatives are, for example (+) -L-tartaric acid amides, such as (+)-L-tartaric acid bis-(N, N-diallylamide), (+)-L-tartaric acid bis-(N, N-di benzyl amide), (+)-L-tartaric acid bis- (N, N-diisopropylamide), (+)-L-tartaric acid bis- (N, N-dimethylamide), (+)-L-tartaric acid bis- (N- pyrrolidinamide, (+) -L-tartaric acid bis- (N-piperidinamide), (+) -L-tartaric acid bis- (N-morpholinamide), (+) -L-tartaric acid bis- (N-cycloheptylamide) or (+) -L-tartaric acid bis-(N-4-methyl-N-piperazinamide), or dialkyl (+) -L-tartrates, such as dibutyl (+)-L-tartrate, di-tert-butyl (+) -L-tartrate, diisopropyl (+) -L-tartrate, dimethyl (+) -L-tartrate and diethyl (+) -L-tartrate, or (-) -D-tartaric acid amides, such as (-) -D-tartaric acid bis-(N, N-diallylamide), (-)-D-tartaric acid bis-(N, N-dibenzylamide), (-)-D-tartaric acid bis-(N, N- diisopropylamide), (-) -D-tartaric acid bis- (N, N-dimethylamide), (-) -D-tartaric acid bis- (N- pyrrolidinamide), (-) -D-tartaric acid bis- (N-piperidinamide), (-) -D-tartaric acid bis- (N-morpholinamide), (-) -D-tartaric acid bis- (N-cycloheptylamide) or (-) -D-tartaric acid bis- (N-4-methyl-N-piperazinamide), or dialkyl (-) -D-tartrates, such as dibutyl (-) -D-tartrate, di-tert-butyl (-) -D-tartrate, diisopropyl (-) -D-tartrate, dimethyl (-) -D-tartrate and diethyl (-)-D-tartrate. In general, 0.02-4 equivalents, preferably 0.1-2 equivalents, of the optically pure tartaric acid derivative are employed.<br>
Particularly preferred (+) -L-tartaric acid derivatives are (+) -L-tartaric acid bis- (N, N-dimethylamide), (+) - L-tartaric acid bis- (N-pyrrolidinamide), (+) -L-tartaric acid bis- (N-morpholinamide), and particularly preferred (-) -D-tartaric acid derivatives are (-) -D-tartaric acid bis-<br>
4<br><br>
(N, N-dimethylamide), (-) -D-tartaric acid bis- (N-pyrrolidinamide), (-) -D-tartaric acid bis- (N-<br>
morpholinamide).<br>
Particularly suitable for the preparation of (-)-pantoprazole are (+) -L-tartaric acid bis- (N, N-<br>
dimethylamide),  (+) -L-tartaric acid  bis- (N-pyrrolidinamide) and (+) -L-tartaric acid bis- (N-<br>
morpholinamide), and particularly suitable for the preparation of (+)-pantoprazole are (-) -D-tartaric<br>
acid bis- (N, N-dimethylamide), (-) -D-tartaric acid bis- (N-pyrrolidinamide) and (-) -D-tartaric acid<br>
bis- (N- morpholinamide).<br>
The oxidation is preferably carried out at temperatures between-20 and 50°C, in particular at room<br>
temperature and optionally in the presence of a base, suitable bases being, in particular, organic bases,<br>
preferably a tertiary amine, such as triethylamine or N-ethyidiisopropylamine.<br>
If the process is carried out in a suitable manner, the optically pure PPI having sulphinyl structure is<br>
obtained in an optical purity of &gt;95%. By further steps, such as, for example, pH-controlled<br>
reprecipitation and/or recrystallization in a suitable solvent, such as, for example, isopropanol, it is<br>
possible to further increase the optical  purity considerably. Reprecipitation  is carried out via<br>
intermediate preparation of suitable salts, such as, for example, via the sodium salt (for other possible<br>
salts, see, for example, EP-A-166287).<br>
The invention is illustrated in more detail by the examples below, but not limited in any way. The<br>
abbreviation h stands for hour (s).<br>
Examples<br>
1.     (-)-5-Difluoromethoxv-2-[(3,     4-dimethoxy-2-pyridinyI)methylsulphinyl|-lH-benzimidazole<br>
|=(-)-pantoprazole   or   (S)-pantoprazole|   with   diethyl   (+)-L-tartrate   and   zirconium   (IV)<br>
isopropoxide/isopropano!<br>
A) At room temperature, 20.2 g of 5-difluoromethoxy-2- [ (3, 4-dimethoxy-2-pyridinyl) methylthio]-1H- benzimidazole together with 17.9 g of diethyl (+) -tartrate, 13.4 g of zirconium (IV) isopropoxide/isopropanol and 0.1 ml of water are suspended in 100 ml of methyl isobutyl ketone. The mixture is heated at 40°C for one hour, resulting in the formation of an almost clear solution. After cooling to room temperature, 4.1 ml of N-ethyldiisopropylamine are added. 11 ml of cumene hydroperoxide are then slowly metered in. Stirring at room temperature is continued until the oxidation process has ended (monitored by TLC). The clear solution is quenched with 0.9 g of sodium thiosulphate in 54 ml of water and 30.3 g of 40% (w/w) of NaOH and stirred for another 14 h. After addition of 25 g of sodium chloride, the phases are separated. The aqueous phase is extracted with 50 ml of methyl isobutyl ketone. The combined organic phases are washed together using 25 ml of saturated sodium chloride solution. 150 ml of water are added to the methyl isobutyl ketone solution, and the pH is adjusted to 13 using 10% (w/w) NaOH. The phases are separated and the methyl isobutyl ketone phase is extracted once more with 50 ml of water at pH 13. The aqueous phases are combined and, at 40°C and under reduced pressure, subjected to incipient distillation. At 40-50°C, (-)-<br>
5<br><br>
pantoprazole is precipitated by addition of 10% strength acetic acid to pH 9. Under pH control, stirring is continued for another 12 h. The beige crystals are filtered off and washed with 50 ml of water. This gives the title compound in an optical purity of &gt;90%.<br>
To increase the purity, (-)-pantoprazole is dissolved in water/NaOH and again precipitated by addition of acetic acid to pH 9. Drying gives a beige powder of melting point 145°C (decomposition) and an optical purity of &gt;95%. If this powder is recrystallized from 2-PrOH, a clear crystal of melting point 147- 149°C (decomposition) with an optical rotation of αD20 —140 (c=0.5, MeOH) is obtained. B) Alternatively, the reaction described in Example 1A can be carried out in 100 ml of toluene instead of methyl isobutyl ketone. If the reaction is carried out in toluene, the zirconium salts have to be filtered off after quenching and the reaction product ((S)-pantoprazole as sodium salt) is directly extracted into the aqueous phase. From the aqueous phase, it can then be precipitated under controlled pH as (S)- pantoprazole. This gives beige crystals of an optical purity of &gt; 95%.<br>
2. (-)-5-Difluoromethoxy-2-|(3, 4-dimethoxy-2-pyridinyl) methylsulphinyl|-l H-benzimidazole |= (-)-pantoprazole or (S)-pantoprazolel with (+)-L-tartaric acid bis-(NwN-dimethylamide) and zirconium (IV) isopropoxide/isopropanol<br>
At room temperature, 20.2 g of 5-difluoromethoxy-2- [ (3, 4-dimethoxy-2-pyridmyl) methylthio]-1H-benzimidazole are suspended in 100 ml of methyl isobutyl ketone together with 18.0 g of (+)-L-tartaric acid bis- (N, N-dimethylamide) and 13.4 g of zirconium (IV) isopropoxide-isopropanol. The mixture is heated at 40°C for one hour, resulting in the formation of a solution which is almost clear. After cooling to room temperature, 4.1 ml of N-ethyldiisopropylamine are added. 11 ml of cumene hydroperoxide are then slowly metered in. Stirring is continued at room temperature until the oxidation has ended (5-10 hours, monitored by TLC). The clear solution is diluted with 100 ml of methyl isobutyl ketone and quenched with 1.8 g of sodium thiosulphate in 140 ml of water and stirred for a further 14 hours. After phase separation, 55 ml of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and 55 ml of methyl isobutyl ketone are added to the aqueous phase, and the phases are separated. Another 55 ml of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and 55 ml of methyl isobutyl ketone are added to the aqueous phase, and the phases are separated. The combined methyl isobutyl ketone phases are then washed twice with 55 ml of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. 150 ml of water are added to the methyl isobutyl ketone phase, and the pH is adjusted to pH = 13 using a 40% by weight strength aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. After phase separation, the methyl isobutyl ketone phase is extracted with another 50 ml of water at pH = 13. The aqueous phases are combined and, at 40°C, subjected to incipient distillation under reduced pressure. At 40-45°C, (-)-pantoprazole is precipitated by addition of 10% strength acetic acid to pH = 9.0. Stirring is continued for another 12 hours during which the pH is monitored. The beige crystals are filtered off and washed with 50 ml of water. The title compound is obtained in a yield of about 15 g (73% of theory) and an optical purity of &gt;95%.<br>
6<br><br>
To increase the purity, (-)-pantoprazole is dissolved in water/aqueous sodium hydroxide solution at pH = 13 and re-precipitated with acetic acid (10%) at pH = 9.0<br>
3.	(-)-5-Difluoromethoxy-2-j3, 4-dimethoxy-2-pyridinyl) methylsulphinyl]-lH-benzimidazole = (-<br>
)-pantoprazole or (S)-pantoprazole| with (+)-L-tartaric acid bis- (N, N-pyrrolidinamide) and<br>
zirconium (IV) isopropoxide/isopropanol<br>
At room temperature, 20.2 g of 5-difluoromethoxy-2-[(3, 4-dimethoxy-2-pyridinyl) methylthio]-lH-benzimidazole are suspended in 100 ml of methyl isobutyl ketone together with 22.6 g of (2R, 3R)-(+)- L-tartaric acid bis- (N-pyrrolidinamide) and 13.4 g of zirconium (IV) isopropoxide-isopropanol. The mixture is heated at 40°C for one hour, resulting in the formation of a solution which is almost clear.<br>
After cooling to room temperature, 4.1 ml of N-ethyldiisopropylamine are added. 11 ml of cumene hydroperoxide are then slowly metered in. Stirring is continued at room temperature until the oxidation has ended (5-10 hours, monitored by TLC). The clear solution is diluted with 100 ml of methyl isobutyl ketone and quenched with 1.8 g of sodium thiosulphate in 140 ml of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and stirred for a farther 14 hours. After phase separation, the mixture is washed twice with 55 ml of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. 150 ml of water are added to the methyl isobutyl ketone phase, and the pH is adjusted to pH = 13 using a 40% by weight strength aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. After phase separation, the methyl isobutyl ketone phase is extracted with another 50 ml of water at pH = 13. The aqueous phases are combined and, at 40°C, subjected to incipient distillation under reduced pressure. At 40-45°C, (-)-pantoprazole is precipitated by addition of 10% strength acetic acid to pH = 9.0. Stirring is continued for another 12 hours during which the pH is monitored. The beige crystals are filtered off and washed with 50 ml of water. The title compound is obtained in a yield of about 17 g (80% of theory) and an optical purity of &gt;98%. To increase the purity, (-)-pantoprazole is dissolved in water/aqueous sodium hydroxide solution at pH = 13 and re-precipitated with acetic acid (10%) at pH = 9.0.<br>
