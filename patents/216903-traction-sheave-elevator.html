				<td>The present invention relates to a traction sheave<br>
elevator, an elevator car and a method for suspending<br>
an elevator car on hoisting ropes.<br>
In prior art, specification EP 0 631 967 A2 presents a<br>
traction sheave elevator without machine room, in<br>
which an elevator car moving in an elevator shaft is<br>
guided by vertical car guide rails while the counterweight<br>
moves along guide rails placed on the same side<br>
of the elevator car as the car guide rails. Such a .<br>
suspension arrangement, in which all guide rails are<br>
placed as a compact structure on one side of the ele-<br>
vator car, is called piggyback suspension. The drive<br>
motor, provided with a traction sheave, is mounted in<br>
the upper part of the guide rails. Connected to the<br>
elevator car are two car rope pulleys, placed under<br>
the bottom of the elevator car at opposite edges. The<br>
first end of the rope is attached to a fixed top<br>
structure in the upper part of the elevator shaft, on<br>
the same side of the elevator car as where the car and<br>
counterweight guide rails are located. From the an-<br>
chorage of its first end, the rope is passed down via<br>
a counterweight rope pulley attached to the counter-<br>
weight, frqm where it is deflected up and passed to<br>
the traction sheave of the drive motor, from where it<br>
is further deflected down and passed around two rope<br>
pulleys mounted on the elevator car, so that the rope<br>
passes under the elevator car by one side, where the<br>
guide rails are located, to the other side and further-<br>
up to a fixed top structure, to which the other end of<br>
the rope is fixed and which is located on the other<br>
side of the elevator car relative to the location of<br>
the car and counterweight guide rails. In this way, an<br>
advantageous 2:1 suspension arrangement is achieved,<br>
allowing the machinery to be designed in accordance<br>
with a lower torque requirement.<br>
A problem with the prior-art elevator is that the two<br>
rope pulleys below the elevator car require a certain<br>
space in the vertical direction of the elevator. This<br>
a problem particularly in buildings where it is not<br>
possible to extend the elevator shaft substantially<br>
below the level of the lowest floor to provide a suf-<br>
ficient space for the rope pulleys under the elevator<br>
car when the car is at the bottom floor. This problem<br>
is often encountered in conjunction with the moderni-<br>
zation of old elevator shafts where a scanty space has<br>
been provided at the bottom end of the shaft. In old<br>
buildings, building a new elevator shaft or extending<br>
the old one to a level clearly below the bottom floor<br>
is a significant cost factor. Similarly, an insuffi-<br>
cient head room at the top end may be an obstacle to<br>
mounting car rope pulleys on the top of the elevator<br>
car. As for new buildings, an elevator shaft that<br>
takes up as little space in the vertical direction as<br>
possible would be an advantage.<br>
A further problem with the prior-art elevator is that,<br>
on the opposite side of the elevator car relative to<br>
the side on which the car and counterweight guide<br>
rails are located, a sufficient space for rope passage<br>
must be provided between the shaft wall and the wall<br>
of the elevator car, which constitutes a limitation of<br>
the widthwise dimension of the elevator car, prevent-<br>
ing effective utilization of the cross-sectional area<br>
of the elevator shaft.<br>
The object of the invention is to eliminate the prob-<br>
lems mentioned above.<br>
A specific object of the invention is to disclose an<br>
elevator that is as compact as possible, requiring as<br>
little space as possible in the elevator shaft in both<br>
vertical and horizontal directions so as to allow as<br>
efficient shaft space utilization as possible. A fur-<br>
ther object of the invention is to disclose an eleva-<br>
tor which is well suited for use both in new buildings<br>
and in old buildings for the modernization of elevator<br>
solutions in existing elevator shafts or even as an<br>
elevator for which a shaft is built afterwards in an<br>
existing building.<br>
As for the features characteristic of the traction<br>
sheave elevator, elevator car and method of the<br>
invention and the use of a diverting pulley according<br>
to the invention, reference is made to the claims.<br>
The elevator of the invention comprises car guide<br>
rails disposed vertically in an elevator shaft; an<br>
elevator car designed to move along the car guide<br>
rails; counterweight guide rails disposed in the ele-<br>
vator shaft on the same side of the elevator car as<br>
the car guide rails; a counterweight designed to move<br>
along the counterweight guide rails; an upper rope<br>
pulley mounted on a fixed top structure in the upper<br>
part of the elevator shaft; a car rope pulley con-<br>
nected to the elevator car; a counterweight rope pul-<br>
ley connected to the counterweight; a drive motor dis-<br>
posed in the elevator shaft to drive one of the rope<br>
pulleys; and a rope whose first end is attached to a<br>
fixed top structure in the upper part of the elevator<br>
shaft on the same side of the elevator car with the <br>
car and counterweight guide rails, from where the rope<br>
is passed via the counterweight rope pulley, upper<br>
rope pulley and car rope pulley, and whose second end<br>
is attached to a fixed top structure.<br>
According to the invention, the second end of the rope<br>
is attached to a fixed top structure on the same side<br>
of the elevator car as the first end. The car rope<br>
pulley is rotatably mounted with bearings at the side<br>
of the elevator car on the same side of the elevator<br>
car as the car and counterweight guide rails.<br>
"Fixed top structure" refers to a fixed structure in<br>
the upper part of the elevator shaft near the ceiling,<br>
or to the top of the elevator shaft, the guide rails<br>
in the upper part of the shaft or corresponding structures .<br>
The invention has the advantage that it makes it possible<br>
to build an elevator that is as compact as possible<br>
in the vertical direction and, on the other<br>
hand, as large as possible in relation to the cross-<br>
sectional area of the elevator shaft. The entire machinery<br>
as well as the rope and rope pulleys can be<br>
located on one side of the elevator car as a compact<br>
package. Furthermore, the invention has the advantage<br>
that, in addition to new buildings, it is suited for<br>
use in modernization projects. A further advantage is<br>
that the space at the bottom end of the elevator shaft<br>
can be constructed to dimensions as small as possible.<br>
In addition, the invention has the advantage that it<br>
is suited for use as an elevator without machine room,<br>
with the elevator machine mounted in the elevator<br>
shaft.<br>
In an embodiment of the elevator, the car guide rails<br>
and counterweight guide rails are attached to each<br>
other and to the wall of the elevator shaft, arranged<br>
side by side parallel to each other, the counterweight<br>
guide rails being placed between the wall of the elevator<br>
shaft and the car guide rails.<br>
In an embodiment of the elevator, the distance between<br>
the counterweight guide rails is equal to the distance<br>
between the car guide rails. The conventional design<br>
of the counterweight is such that the mass of the<br>
counterweight equals the car weight when the car is<br>
empty, added by half the specified load. By disposing<br>
the counterweight guide rails at a maximal distance<br>
from each other, the width of the counterweight can be<br>
maximized, and consequently a compact counterweight<br>
with a short vertical dimension is achieved.<br>
In an embodiment of the elevator, the upper rope pul-<br>
ley is the drive wheel connected to the drive motor.<br>
In this case, the drive motor is mounted on the car<br>
guide rails and/or counterweight guide rails in the<br>
upper part of the elevator shaft, which means that the<br>
elevator has no machine room. It is also possible to<br>
use one of the other rope pulleys mentioned as a drive<br>
wheel.<br>
In an embodiment of the elevator, the elevator comprises<br>
a L-shaped frame structure attached to the<br>
car, extending on the, side wall of the elevator car on<br>
that side where the car guide rails and counterweight<br>
guide rails are located and under the bottom of the<br>
elevator car. The car rope pulley and the guide elements<br>
acting together with the car guide rails are<br>
connected to this frame structure.<br>
In an embodiment of the elevator, the car rope pulley-<br>
is placed in the lower part of the elevator car near<br>
its bottom.<br>
The car rope pulley is preferably disposed inside the<br>
space defined by the elevator car and the frame structure<br>
to achieve compact space utilization.<br>
In an embodiment of the elevator, a vertical tangent<br>
to the upper rope pulley is substantially aligned with<br>
a vertical tangent to the counterweight rope pulley,<br>
in which case the rope portion between them is substantially<br>
vertical. Correspondingly, a vertical tangent<br>
to the upper rope pulley is substantially aligned<br>
with a vertical tangent to the car rope pulley, so the<br>
rope portion between these pulleys, too, is substantially<br>
vertical.<br>
In an embodiment of the elevator, the middle plane of<br>
rotation of the counterweight rope pulley is parallel<br>
to the middle plane of rotation of the car rope pulley.<br>
The middle plane of rotation of the upper rope<br>
pulley is at an angle to the middle planes of rotation<br>
of the car rope pulley and counterweight rope pulley.<br>
 In this case, the middle plane of rotation of the car<br>
rope pulley may be parallel to the side wall of the<br>
elevator car, or alternatively the middle plane of rotation<br>
of the car rope pulley may be at an angle to<br>
the side wall of the elevator car.<br>
In an embodiment of the elevator, the drive motor is a<br>
permanent magnet synchronous motor and the upper rope<br>
pulley is integrated with the rotor of the motor.<br>
 In a traction sheave elevator without machine room,<br>
the use of a diverting pulley mounted on the side of<br>
the elevator car to suspend the car on the hoisting<br>
ropes allows the elevator to be installed in an elevator<br>
shaft having a height dimension smaller than the<br>
conventional height. In principle, this solution can<br>
be used both in elevators with machine room above and<br>
in elevators with machine room below. To economize on<br>
the cross-sectional area of the elevator shaft, the<br>
diverting pulley attached to the elevator car must be<br>
parallel to the car wall or only moderately askew<br>
relative to the wall. An economical solution is to<br>
mount the hoisting machine on a fixed structure of the<br>
elevator shaft. However, in elevators with machine<br>
room below, the amount of material including diverting<br>
pulleys and ropes is larger and, as the number of di-<br>
verting pulleys and rope portions between rope pulleys<br>
is larger, a solution with machine room below may re-<br>
sult in an elevator having a slightly larger height<br>
dimension than an elevator with machine room above.<br>
When the suspension of the elevator is implemented us-<br>
ing a diverting pulley on the side of the elevator<br>
car, the height dimension can be best reduced by plac-<br>
ing the drive machine at such a height in the elevator<br>
shaft that the elevator car can move to a position<br>
alongside the machine.<br>
In the following, the invention will be described in<br>
detail by the aid of a few examples of its embodiments<br>
accompanying <br>
with reference to the drawing, wherein<br>
Fig. 1 presents diagram representing an embodiment of<br>
the elevator of the invention as seen in an oblique<br>
top view,<br>
Fig. 2 presents a diagrammatic top view of the eleva-<br>
tor in Fig. 1, and<br>
Fig. 3 a diagrammanatic top view of another embodiment<br>
of the elevator of the invention.<br>
Fig. 1 presents a diagrairanatic view of a traction<br>
sheave elevator with a car suspended according to the<br>
so-called piggyback principle. The car guide rails 1<br>
are disposed vertically in the elevator shaft on one<br>
side relative to the elevator car and the elevator car<br>
2 has been arranged to move along car guide rails 1.<br>
The counterweight guide rails 3 are disposed in the<br>
elevator shaft on the same side of the elevator car as<br>
the car guide rails 1. The car guide rails 1 and the<br>
counterweight guide rails 3 are attached to each other<br>
and to a wall 12 (not shown in Fig. 1, see Fig. 2) of<br>
the elevator shaft, mounted side by side close to each<br>
other in parallel directions so that the counterweight<br>
guide rails 3 are located between the car guide rails<br>
1 and the wall 12 of the elevator shaft. The distance<br>
of the counterweight guide rails 3 from each other is<br>
equal to the distance of the car guide rails 1 from<br>
each other, so the counterweight 4 moving along the<br>
counterweight guide rails can be of a shape having a<br>
large width and a small length.<br>
The drive motor 8 is mounted on a transverse support<br>
17 connected to the upper ends of all four guide rails<br>
1, 3. The drive motor 8 is a permanent magnet synchro-<br>
nous motor, the driving rope pulley 5 being integrated<br>
with its rotor.<br>
Attached to the elevator car 2 is an L-shaped frame<br>
(see Fig 2.j<br>
structure 13 extending along the side wall 14 of the<br>
elevator car 1 on that side where the car guide rails<br>
1 and counterweight guide rails 3 are located and un-<br>
der the bottom 15 of the elevator car to support the<br>
car. Guide elements 16 acting together with the car<br>
guide rails 1 are connected to the frame structure 13.<br>
Connected to the frame structure 13 is also a car rope<br>
or diverting pulley<br>
pulley 6. The car rope pulley 6 is located at the side<br>
of the elevator car 2 in its lower part on the same<br>
side of the elevator car 1 with the car guide rails 1<br>
and counterweight guide rails 3 so that the car rope<br>
pulley 6 does not protrude below the car 1 or outside<br>
the frame structure 13.<br>
The first end 10 of the rope 9 is attached to the sup-<br>
port 17 between the guide rails 1, 3, from where it is<br>
passed down to the counterweight rope pulley 7 on the<br>
upper edge of the counterweight 4. From here, the rope<br>
is deflected back up and goes to the traction sheave 5<br>
of the drive motor 8, from where it is again deflected<br>
downward and passed to the rope pulley 6 mounted on<br>
the side of the elevator car 2, from where it is deflected<br>
upward and passed to the anchorage of the second<br>
end 11 in the support 17 between the guide rails<br>
1, 3. Thus, the elevator car is suspended on the rope<br>
loop between the traction sheave 5 and the rope end<br>
II. All the rope pulleys 5, 6, 7 are located on the<br>
same side relative to the elevator car, so the rope 9<br>
can run substantially entirely in the space between<br>
the guide rails 1, 3.<br>
For the sake of clarity, Fig. 1 shows only one rope,<br>
but it is obvious that the rope may comprise a bundle<br>
of ropes or a plurality of adjacent ropes, as is usu-<br>
ally the case in elevators. Also, the rope pulleys 5,<br>
6, 7 are presented as simple grooved wheels, but it is<br>
obvious that when a plurality of adjacent ropes are<br>
used, the rope pulleys are manifold or several rope<br>
pulleys may be placed side by side. The rope pulleys<br>
may be provided with grooves of a semi-circular cross-<br>
section, and the traction sheave may have undercut<br>
grooves to increase friction.<br>
Figs. 2 and 3 illustrate two embodiments for the ar-<br>
rangement of the rope pulleys 5, 6, 7 relative to each<br>
other. In the drawings, the drive motor 8 and the<br>
driving rope pulley 5 are depicted with broken lines<br>
while the counterweight rope pulley 7 and the car rope<br>
pulley 6 are depicted with solid lines. In both embodiments,<br>
the aim is to arrange the rope pulleys<br>
5, 6, 7 in such a way that the rope will apply as<br>
little skewed pull-to"the rope wheel grooves as possi-<br>
ble as it passes from one wheel rim to the next. Without<br>
the arrangement described below, skewed pull might<br>
occur when the counterweight rope pulley 7 is in a<br>
high position close to the traction sheave 5 and similarly<br>
when the car rope pulley 6 is close to the traction<br>
sheave 5.<br>
In Figs. 2 and 3, skewed pull is eliminated by using an<br>
arrangement in which a vertical tangent to the driving<br>
rope pulley 5 is substantially aligned with a vertical<br>
tangent to the counterweight rope pulley 7, the rope<br>
portion between these pulleys being thus substantially<br>
vertical, and in which a tangent to the upper rope<br>
pulley 5 is substantially aligned with a vertical tangent<br>
to the car rope pulley 6, the rope portion 9 between<br>
these pulleys being likewise substantially vertical.<br>
In Fig. 2, both the car rope pulley 6 and the counterweight<br>
rope pulley 7 are disposed in identical positions<br>
so that their middle planes of rotation are parallel<br>
to each other and at an angle to the middle<br>
plane of rotation of the traction sheave 5. The middle<br>
plane of rotation of the traction sheave 5 is parallel<br>
to the side wall 14 of the elevator car and the shaft<br>
wall, whereas the middle planes of rotation of the car<br>
rope pulley 6 and counterweight rope pulley 7 are at<br>
an inclined angle to the side wall 14 of the elevator<br>
car and the shaft wall.<br>
In Fig. 3, both the car rope pulley 6 and the counterweight<br>
rope pulley 7 are disposed in identical positions<br>
so that their middle planes of rotation are parallel<br>
to each other and at, an angle to the middle<br>
plane of rotation of the traction sheave 5. The drive<br>
motor 8 is placed in an inclined, position so that the<br>
middle plane of rotation of the traction sheave 5 is<br>
at an angle to the side wall 14 of the elevator car<br>
and the shaft wall whereas the middle planes of rota-<br>
tion of the car rope pulley 6 and counterweight rope<br>
pulley 7 are parallel to the side wall 14 of the ele-<br>
vator car and the shaft wall.<br>
