				<td>Organosilicon compounds<br>
This invention relates to organosilicon compounds, to a<br>
process for the production thereof and to the use thereof.<br>
It is known to use silanes as adhesion promoters.<br>
Aminoalkyltrialkoxysilanes, such as for example 3-amino-<br>
propyltrimethoxysilane and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane,<br>
methacryloxyalkyltrialkoxysilanes, such as for example<br>
3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, polysulfane<br>
alkyltrialkoxysilanes, such as for example bis[3-triethoxy-<br>
silylpropyl]polysulfane and bis[3-triethoxysilylpropyl]-<br>
disulfane and mercaptoalkyltrialkoxysilanes, such as for<br>
example 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane and 3-mercapto-<br>
propyltriethoxysilane as adhesion promoters between<br>
inorganic materials, for example glass fibres, metals or<br>
oxide fillers, and organic polymers, such as thermosets,<br>
thermoplastics and elastomers, or as crosslinking agents<br>
and surface-modifying agents.<br>
These adhesion promoters or coupling or bonding agents form<br>
bonds both with the filler and with the elastomer, so<br>
ensuring good interaction between the filler surface and<br>
the elastomer. They reduce mixture viscosity and facilitate<br>
filler dispersion.<br>
It is moreover known that using conventional commercial<br>
silane adhesion promoters (DE 22 55 577) having three<br>
alkoxy substituents on the silicon atom results in the<br>
release of considerable quantities of alcohol during and<br>
after bonding to the filler. Since the silanes used are<br>
generally trimethoxy- and triethoxy-substituted,<br>
considerable quantities of the corresponding alcohols<br>
methanol and ethanol are released.<br>
It is furthermore known that methoxy- and ethoxy-<br>
substituted silanes are more reactive than the<br>
corresponding long-chain alkoxy-substituted silanes and are<br>
thus able to bond themselves to the filler more rapidly,<br>
such that, on economic grounds, it is not possible to<br>
dispense with the use of methoxy- and ethoxy-substituted<br>
silanes.<br>
One disadvantage of known organosilicon compounds is the<br>
release of volatile alcohols, such as methanol and ethanol,<br>
into the environment during and after bonding of the silane<br>
to the filler.<br>
The object of the invention is to produce organosilicon<br>
compounds which release smaller quantities of volatile<br>
alcohol during bonding to the filler and simultaneously<br>
have elevated reactivity.<br>
The present invention provides organosilicon compounds of<br>
the general formula I and/or II<br>
wherein R is a mothyl or ethyl group,<br>
R' is identical or different and is a C9-C30 branched or<br>
unbranched monovalent alkyl or alkenyl group, aryl group <br>
aralkyl group branched or unbranched C2-C30 alkyl ether<br>
group, branched or unbranched C2-C30 alkyl polyether group<br>
or R' ' ' si , where R' ' ' is C1-C30 branched or unbranched<br>
alkyl or alkenyl group, aralkyl group or aryl group,<br>
R" is a branched or unbranched, saturated or unsaturated,<br>
aliphatic, aromatic or mixed aliphatic/aromatic divalent<br>
C1-C30 hydrocarbon group,<br>
X is NH13mh where 1,2, 3 and m =1; O(C=O)-R'' where<br>
n = 1 and m = 1, SH where n = 1 and m = 1, S where n = 2<br>
and m = 1-10 and mixtures thereof, S(C=O)-R'' where n = 1<br>
and m = 1 on H where n = 1 and m = 1.<br>
R" may mean CH2, CH2CH2, CH2CH2CH2, CH2CH2CH2CH2, CH(CH3),<br>
CH2CH(CH3), C(CH3)2, CH(C2H5), CH2CH2CH (CH3) , CH2CH (CH3) CH2<br>
or <br>
Organosilicon compounds according to the invention of the<br>
formula I or II may be:<br><br>
The present invention also provides a process for the<br>
production of the organosilicon compounds according to the<br>
invention, which process is characterised in that silanes<br>
of the general formula III<br>
in which R, R", X, m and n have the above-stated meaning,<br>
are reacted with alcohols of the general formula R'-OH, in<br>
which R' exhibits the above-stated meaning, with<br>
elimination of R-OH, and R-OH is continuously separated<br>
from the reaction mixture by distillation.<br>
In the process according to the invention, a mixture may be<br>
obtained in which none, one, two or three of the RO groups<br>
are replaced by R'O groups. The ratio of the RO groups to<br>
R'O groups may be determined by the molar ratio of the<br>
silane of the general formula III to the alcohol of the<br>
general formula R'-OH. For example, when n = 1, an<br>
organosilicon compound having an average composition<br>
according to the formula I may be produced by reacting two<br>
mol equivalents of the alcohol of the general formula R'-OH<br>
with one mol equivalent of the silane of the general<br>
formula III. For example, when n = 2, an organosilicon<br>
compound having an average composition according to the<br>
formula I may be produced by reacting four mol. equivalents<br>
of the alcohol of the general formula R'-OH with one mol<br>
equivalent of the silane of the general formula III.<br>
The mixture may be used as is or separated into individual<br>
compounds.<br>
When R' = R''3Si, the silane of the general formula III<br>
may be reacted with R''3Si-OH or with R''3Si-O-SiR''3.<br>
The compound R1 ''3Si-O-SiR' ' '3 can hydrolyse to yield<br>
R''3Si-OH and react with the silane of the general formula<br>
III.<br>
The reaction may be accelerated by neutral, acidic or basic<br>
catalysts, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid,<br>
phosphoric acid, formic acid, acetic acid, para-<br>
toluenesulfonic acid, sodium hydroxide solution, potassium<br>
hydroxide solution, sodium methylate, sodium ethylate,<br>
Deloxan ASP 1/9, Amberlyst 15 ion exchange resins or metal<br>
compounds.<br>
Metal compounds may also be transition metal compounds.<br>
Metal compounds which may be used for the catalysts are<br>

The metal compounds may have a free coordination site on<br>
the metal.<br>
Metal compounds which are formed by addition of water to<br>
yield hydrolysable metal compounds may also be used as<br>
catalysts.<br>
In one particular embodiment, titanates, such as for<br>
example tetra-n-butyl orthotitanate or tetra-iso-propyl<br>
orthotitanate, may be used as catalysts.<br>
The metal compounds may be anhydrous, as a result of which<br>
overall less water is introduced into the reaction mixture<br>
and fewer oligomeric silane compounds are obtained.<br>
The reaction may be performed at temperatures of between 20<br>
and 200°C. In order to avoid condensation reactions, it may<br>
be advantageous to perform the reaction in an anhydrous<br>
atmosphere, preferably in an inert gas atmosphere.<br>
The organosilicon compounds according to the invention may<br>
be used as adhesion promoters between inorganic materials<br>
(for example glass fibres, metals, oxide fillers, silicas)<br>
and organic polymers {for example thermosets,<br>
thermoplastics, elastomers), or as crosslinking agents and<br>
surface-modifying agents. The organosilicon compounds<br>
according to the invention may be used as adhesion<br>
promoters in tyres filled with silica and/or starch.<br>
The present invention also provides rubber mixtures, which<br>
are characterised in that they contain rubber, filler, such<br>
as for example precipitated silica, optionally further<br>
rubber auxiliary substances, as well as at least one<br>
organosilicon compound according to the invention.<br>
The organosilicon compound according to the invention may<br>
be used in quantities of 0.1 to 20 wt.%, relative to the<br>
quantity of rubber used.<br>
The organosilicon compounds according to the invention and<br>
the fillers may preferably be added at composition<br>
temperatures of 100 to 200°C. They may, however, also be<br>
added later at lower temperatures (40 to 100°C), for<br>
example together with further rubber auxiliary substances.<br>
The organosilicon compound may be added to the mixing<br>
process both in pure form and applied onto an inert organic<br>
or inorganic support. Preferred support materials are<br>
silicas," waxes, thermoplastics, natural or synthetic<br>
silicates, aluminium oxide or carbon blacks.<br>
The following fillers may be used as fillers for the rubber<br>
mixtures according to the invention:<br>
carbon blacks: the carbon blacks to be used for this<br>
purpose are produced using the lamp black, furnace<br>
black or gas black processes and have BET surface areas<br>
of 20 to 200 m2/g, such as for example SAF, ISAF, HSAF,<br>
HAF, FEF or GPF blacks. The carbon blacks may<br>
optionally also contain heteroatoms such as for example<br>
Si.<br>
highly disperse silicas produced, for example, by<br>
precipitation of solutions of silicates or flame<br>
hydrolysis of silicon halides, with specific surface<br>
areas of 5 to 1000, preferably of 20 to 400 m2/g (BET<br>
surface area) and with primary particle sizes of 10 to<br>
400 nm. The silicas may optionally also assume the form<br>
of mixed oxides with other metal oxides, such as Al,<br>
Mg, Ca, Ba, Zn and titanium oxides.<br>
synthetic silicates, such as aluminium silicate,<br>
alkaline earth metal silicates, such as magnesium<br>
silicate or calcium silicate, with BET surface areas of<br>
20 to 400 m2/g and primary particle diameters of 10 to<br>
4 00 nm.<br>
synthetic or natural aluminium oxides and hydroxides<br>
natural silicates, such as kaolin and other naturally<br>
occurring silicas.<br>
glass fibres and glass fibre products (mats, strands)<br>
or glass microbeads.<br>
Highly disperse silicas, produced by precipitation of<br>
solutions of silicates, with BET surface areas of 20 to<br>
400 m2/g may preferably be used in quantities of 5 to 150<br>
parts by weight, in each case relative to 100 parts of<br>
rubber.<br>
The stated fillers may be used individually or as a<br>
mixture. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the<br>
process, 10 to 150 parts by weight of light-coloured<br>
fillers, optionally together with 0 to 100 parts by weight<br>
of carbon black, and 0.3 to 10 parts by weight of a<br>
compound of the oligomeric organosilanes according to the<br>
invention, in each case relative to 100 parts by weight of<br>
rubber, may be used to produce the mixtures.<br>
Not only natural rubber but also synthetic rubbers are<br>
suitable for the production of the rubber mixtures<br>
according to the invention. Preferred synthetic rubbers are<br>
described, for example, in W. Hofmann, Kautschuk-<br>
technologie, Genter Verlag, Stuttgart 1980. They include,<br>
inter alia,<br>
polybutadiene (BR)<br>
polyisoprene (IR)<br>
styrene/butadiene copolymers with styrene contents of 1<br>
to 60, preferably of 2 to 50 wt.% (SBR)<br>
isobutylene/isoprene copolymers (IIR)<br>
butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymers with acrylonitrile<br>
contents of 5 to 60, preferably of 10 to 50 wt.% (NBp.)<br>
partially hydrogenated or completely hydrogenated NBR<br>
rubber (HNBR)<br>
ethylene/propylene/diene copolymers (EPDM)<br>
as well as mixtures of these rubbers- Anionically<br>
polymerised S-SBR rubbers (solution SBR) with a glass<br>
transition temperature of above -50°C and the mixtures<br>
thereof with diene rubbers are in particular of interest<br>
for the production of automotive tyres.<br>
The rubber vulcanisates according to the invention may<br>
contain further rubber auxiliary substances, such as<br>
reaction accelerators, antioxidants, heat stabilisers,<br>
light stabilisers, antiozonants, processing auxiliaries,<br>
plasticisers, tackifiers, blowing agents, dyes, pigments,<br>
waxes, extenders, organic acids, retarders, metal oxides as<br>
well as activators, such as triethanolamine, polyethylene<br>
glycol, hexanetriol, which are known in the rubber<br>
industry.<br>
The rubber auxiliary substances may be used in known<br>
quantities which are determined, inter alia, by the<br>
intended application. Conventional quantities are for<br>
example quantities of 0.1 to 50 wt.%, relative to rubber.<br>
Sulfur or sulfur-donating substances may be used as<br>
vulcanising agents. The rubber mixtures according to the<br>
invention may furthermore contain vulcanisation<br>
accelerators. Examples of suitable vulcanisation<br>
accelerators are mercaptobenzothiazoles, sulfenamides,<br>
guanidines, thiurams, dithiocarbamates, thioureas and<br>
thiocarbonates. The vulcanisation accelerators and sulfur<br>
are used in quantities of 0.1 to 10 wt.%, preferably of 0.1<br>
to 5 wt.%, relative to rubber.<br>
Vulcanisation of the rubber mixtures according to the<br>
invention may proceed at temperatures of 100 to 2000C,<br>
preferably of 130 to 180°C, optionally under a pressure of<br>
10 to 200 bar. Blending of the rubbers with the filler,<br>
optionally rubber auxiliary substances and the<br>
organosilicon compound according to the invention may be<br>
performed in known mixing units, such as roll mills,<br>
internal mixers and compounding extruders.<br>
The rubber mixtures according to the invention are suited<br>
to the production of mouldings, for example for the<br>
production of pneumatic tyres, tyre treads, cable<br>
sheathing, hoses, drive belts, conveyor belts, roll covers,<br>
tyres, shoe soles, sealing rings and damping components.<br>
The organosilicon compounds according to the invention have<br>
the advantage that, at constant reactivity, less methanol<br>
or ethanol is released than with known silanes. Due to<br>
their inactivity, the nonvolatile alcohols are not<br>
separated from the silane or, due to their nonvolatility,<br>
remain in the polymer matrix. In either case, they are not<br>
released into the environment.<br>
Example 1:<br>
200.0 g of bis(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)polysulfane (formula<br>
III where R = ethyl, R" = CH2CH2CH2, X = S, n = 2 and m =<br>
3.8) and 70.0 g of 1-dodecanol (R1 = C12H25) are initially<br>
introduced at room temperature into a 1 litre four-necked<br>
flask with distillation attachment and combined with 1.0 g<br>
of Amberlyst 15. The yellowish solution is heated to 100-<br>
130°C, the resultant ethanol removed by distillation and<br>
210 g of 1-dodecanol are added dropwise within 1.5 h. The<br>
resultant ethanol is continuously removed by distillation.<br>
Towards the end of the reaction, the temperature is briefly<br>
raised to 150°C. The mixture is then distilled in a rotary<br>
evaporator under a vacuum at 80CC and 50 mbar. 408.5 g<br>
(99.4%) of a yellow liquid of the formula I where R =<br>
ethyl, R' = C12H25, R' = CH2CH2CH2, X = S, n - 2 and m = 3.8<br>
are obtained.<br>
Example 2:<br>
200.0 g of bis(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)polysulfane (formula<br>
III where R = ethyl, R" = CH2CH2CH2, X = S, n == 2 and m =<br>
3.8) and 70.0 g of 1-dodecanol (R' = C12H25) are initially<br>
introduced at room temperature into a 1 litre four-necked<br>
flask with distillation attachment and combined with 0.7 g<br>
of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate. The yellowish<br>
solution is heated to 100-105°C, the resultant ethanol<br>
removed by distillation and 210 g of 1-dodecanol are added<br>
dropwise within 1.5 h. The resultant ethanol is<br>
continuously removed by distillation. Towards the end of<br>
the reaction, the temperature is briefly raised to 130°C.<br>
The mixture is then distilled in a rotary evaporator under<br>
a vacuum at 80°C and 50 mbar. 389.1 g (94.7%) of a yellow<br>
liquid of the formula I where R = ethyl, R1 = C12H25, R" =<br>
CH2CH2CH2, X = S, n = 2 and m = 3.8 are obtained.<br>
Example 3:<br>
200.0 g of bis(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)polysulfane (formula<br>

Testing of the organosilicon compounds in practical rubber-<br>
applications<br>
The formulation used for the rubber mixtures is stated in<br>
Table 1 below. The unit phr here means parts by weight<br>
relative to 100 parts of crude rubber used. The general<br>
method for the production of rubber mixtures and the<br>
vulcanisates thereof is described in the book "Rubber<br>
Technology Handbook", W. Hofmann, Hanser Verlag 1994.<br>
Polymer VSL 5025-1 is a solution-polymerised SBR<br>
copolymer from Bayer AG with a styrene content of<br>
25 wt.% and a butadiene content of 75 wt.%. The<br>
copolymer contains 37.5 phr of oil and exhibits a<br>
Mooney viscosity (ML l+4/100°C) of 50 ± 4.<br>
Polymer Buna CB 24 is a cis-1,4-polybutadiene<br>
(neodymium type) from Bayer AG having a cis-1,4 content<br>
of at least 97% and a Mooney viscosity of 44 ± 5.<br>
Naftolen ZD from Chemetall is used as the aromatic oil.<br>
Vulkanox 4020 is 6PPD from Bayer AG and Protektor G35P<br>
is an antiozonant wax from HB-Fuller GmbH. Vulkacit D<br>
(DPG) and Vulkazit CZ (CBS) are commercial products of<br>
Bayer AG.<br>
Ultrasil 7000 GR is a readily dispersible precipitated<br>
silica from Degussa AG with a BET surface area of<br>
170 m2/g. Si 69, bis(3-<br>
triethoxysilylpropyl)tetrasulfane, is a commercial<br>
product of Degussa AG.<br>
The rubber mixtures are produced in an internal mixer<br>
in accordance with the mixing instructions in Table 2.<br>
The results from technical rubber testing are shown in<br>
Table 4a and Table 4b. The mixtures are vulcanised for<br>
20 min at 165°C.<br>
As is evident from the data in Tables 4a and 4b, the<br>
Mooney viscosity of the mixtures comprising the<br>
organosilicon compound according to the invention is<br>
below that of the reference mixture 1.<br>
The mixtures comprising the organosilicon compounds<br>
according to the invention (ethers) exhibit more rapid<br>
vulcanisation. The reinforcement factor is at a high<br>
level for all the mixtures, while tensile strength and<br>
elongation at break values are likewise comparable with<br>
the Si 69 reference. DIN abrasion is good for all the<br>
mixtures. The static rubber values demonstrate that the<br>
silica-silane-rubber bond has formed.<br>
The Goodrich Flexometer tests shows that the mixtures<br>
comprising the long-chain alcohols result in lower heat<br>
build-up and an improved permanent set. MTS testing<br>
clearly reveals lower dynamic rigidity values and a<br>
reduced tan 5 60°C (lower rolling resistance).<br>
Example 12:<br>
180.0 g of bis(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)disulfane<br>
(formula III where R = Ethyl, R" = CH2CH2CH2, X = S, n =<br>

triethoxysilylpropyDpolysulfane (formula III where R =<br>
ethyl, R" = CH2CH2CH2, X = S, n = 2, m = 3.8), 322.2 g<br>
of 1-tetradecanol (R' = -C14H29) and 1.0 g of p-<br>
toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate are heated to 110°C in<br>
the 1 litre flask on a rotary evaporator and the<br>
resultant ethanol removed by vacuum distillation at<br>
40 mbar within 4 h. 448.1 g (99.0%) of a yellow liquid<br>
of the formula I where R = ethyl, R' = -C14H29, R1 ' =<br>
CH2CH2CH2, X = S, n = 2 and m = 3.8 are obtained.<br>
Example 15:<br>
A mixture consisting of 150 g of Si 69 (compound III<br>
where R = -CH2CH3, R2 = -CH2CH2CH2-, X = S, n = 2, m = 1<br>
to 10 and an average m of 3.8), and a 4x molar quantity<br>
of tetradecanol are heated with the stated quantities<br>
of catalyst to the stated temperatures in the 1 litre<br>
flask on a rotary evaporator and the resultant ethanol<br>
is removed by vacuum distillation at 40 mbar within<br>
120 min (Table 5). After cooling, a yellow to yellow-<br>
orange, relatively high viscosity liquid of the formula<br>
I where R = -CH2CH3, R2 = -CH2CH2CH2-, X = S with n = 2<br>
and m = 1 to 10 is obtained.<br>
Si 69 is bis(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)polysulfane with an<br>
average sulfane chain length of 3.8 from Degussa AG.<br>
Ti(OC2H5)4, Ti(OC3H7)4 and Ti (OC4H9) 4 are produced by<br>
Aldrich. p-Toluenesulfonic acid and p-toluenesulfonic<br>
acid sodium salt are produced by Merck-Schuchardt.<br>
Example 16:<br>
A mixture consisting of 100 g of Si 69 (compound III<br>
where R = -CH2CH3, R2 = -CH2CH2CH2-, X = S, n = 2, m = 1<br>
to 10 and an average m of 3.8), and a 4x molar quantity<br>
of corresponding alcohol are heated with the stated<br>
quantities of catalyst to 130°C in a 500 ml three-<br>
necked flask and the resultant ethanol is removed by<br>
distillation within 120 min (Table 6). After cooling, a<br>
yellow to yellow-orange, relatively high viscosity<br>
liquid of the formula I where R = -CH2CH3, R2 =<br>
-CH2CH2CH2-, X = S with n = 2 and m = 1 to 10 is<br>
obtained.<br>
Tables 5 and 6 show the corresponding NMR analytical<br>
results<br>
The nuclear magnetic resonance analysis results are<br>
obtained using a Bruker DRX 500 NMR spectrometer in<br>
accordance with the rules and operating procedures<br>
known to the person skilled in the art. The mass<br>
frequencies used are 99.35 MHz for 29Si nuclei and<br>
500 MHz for 1H nuclei.<br>
Tetramethylsilane (TMS) is used as reference in each<br>
case.<br>
Conversion is defined as the quotient obtained from the<br>
1H NMR integral (Si-O-CxHy) divided by the sum of the 1H<br>
NMR integral (Si-O-Et) and XH NMR integral (Si-O-CxHy) x<br>
0.66. Conversion is stated as a percentage of 1. 100%<br>
conversion means that 4 of 6 equivalents of EtO have<br>
been replaced and 2 equivalents of EtO remain on the<br>
silicon.<br>
The quantity of oligomers is determined by 29Si NMR by<br>
comparing the integrals of the Si(OEt)3 and the<br>
Si(OEt)2-O-Si(OEt)2 signals.<br>
At a comparable or even lower molar catalyst<br>
concentration, the transesterification conversion of<br>
the process according to the invention using metal<br>
compounds is higher at lower temperatures than when<br>
other catalysts are used. In addition, the quantity of<br>
oligomers formed is lower. If p-toluenesulfonic acid<br>
sodium salt is used as an anhydrous equivalent of p-<br>
toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate, conversion is found<br>
to be poorer, even when large quantities of catalyst<br>
are used, than when titanium alkoxides are used (Table<br>
