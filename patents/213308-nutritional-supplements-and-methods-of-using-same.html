NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS AND METHODS OF USING SAME<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a nutritional supplement and methods of using it. More particularly, the present invention relates to a nutritional supplement useful for promoting various health effects and to methods for administering the nutritional supplement for at least these purposes.<br>
B.	Description of the Prior Art	:<br>
Treatment of Sialorrhea<br>
Sialorrhea, a symptom related to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and other causes such as achalasia, acoustic neuroma, Bell's palsy, cerebral palsy, cerebrovascular accident (stroke), glossopharyngeal neuralgia, Guillain-Barre syndrome, hypocalcemia, Ludwig's angina, mental retardation, motor-neuron disease, muscular dystrophy, myasthenia gravis, myotonic dystrophy, paralytic poliomyelitis, polymyositis, Parkinson's disease, Radical Cancer surgery, Seventh-nerve palsy, Shy-Drager syndrome, and Wilson's disease, is the excessive drooling due to salivary gland dysfunction such as overproduction of saliva from the salivary glands. Sometimes, sialorrhea may also be induced by drugs such as clonazepam, ethionamide, haloperidol, and transdermal nicotine among others. Sialorrhea may also be caused by abnormal or unhealthy swallowing by a patient suffering from diseases such as ALS.<br>
Much effort has been made to treat Sialorrhea. Newall et al. reported using beta antagonists to control excessive secretions of the oral salivary glands and reported a 75% success rate (J. Neurol. Sci., 1996, 139,43-4). Mier et al have found that ingestion of glycopyrrolate is effective in treating sialorrhea in children. However, 20% of the children treated with glycopyrrolate experienced substantial adverse effects, enough to require discontinuation of the medication f Arch. Pediatr. Adolese. Med., 2000, 154, 1214-1218). According to a recent study by Rettori et<br><br>
al. (Ann. N. Y. Acad. ScL 2000; 917; 258-67), inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) decrease stimulated salivary secretions whereas donors of NOS potentiate stimulated salivary secretions. This indicates that.nitric oxide exerts a stimulatory role on salivary secretion.<br>
Treatment of Inflammation<br>
In modern non-herbal medicine, there are two major categories of anti¬inflammatory medicines: steroidal and non-steroidal. Steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines are powerful medications, which are based on hormonal substances, such as cortisone. Steroidal medications have a stronger anti-inflammatory response than non-steroidal medicines. Steroidal medications can be taken as pills, injected into the bloodstream, or injected directly into a joint space. There are many non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications. Acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen are the most commonly used non-steroidal anti¬inflammatory medications.<br>
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have three major actions, all of which are related to inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase resulting in decreased formation of prostanoids. Firstly, an anti-inflammatory action can be achieved by reducing production of vasodilator prostaglandins (PGE2, PGI2), which means less vasodilation and, indirectly less oedema. Secondly, an analgesic effect can be achieved by reduced prostaglandin production (less sensitization of nociceptic nerve endings to the inflammatory mediators bradykinin and 5-hydroxytryptamine). Thirdly, an antipyretic effect can produce an anti-inflammatory action, probably due to a decrease in the mediator PGE2 generated in response to inflammatory pyrogens, much as interleukin-1.<br>
There are side effects to both of these groups of medicines. They may include, among other things, stomach upset, stomach bleeding, or ulcers, kidney problems, hearing problems and ankle swelling. Additionally, the steroidal anti¬inflammatory medications can have more serious side effects including: loss of bone mass, cataracts, reduced ability to fight infection, swelling and weight gain,<br><br>
mood changes, high blood pressure, and problems with the bone marrow where blood ceils are produced.<br>
Turmeric (Curcuma longa)<br>
Turmeric, or Haldi in Hindi, is used very widely as medicine as well as a common ingredient in Indian cooking. The rhizome of turmeric is used in medicine and food as a fine powder.<br>
Anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin isolated from Curcuma longa were reported in Srimal and Dhawan, Pharmacology of Diferuloyl Methane, a Non¬steroidal Anti-inflammatory Agent, J. Pharm. Pharmac, 25:447-452 (1973). Significant anti-inflammatory activity for curcumin, comparable with phenylbutazone and hydrocortisone, was observed by Arora et al. (Indian Journal of Medical Research, 1971, 59, 1289-1291). Curcumin, an alkaloid (diferuloyl methane) isolated from the alcoholic extract of turmeric, has been shown to be a potent anti-inflammatory agent. Further work on anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic activity has also been carried out by Thatte et al. (Indian Journal of Pharmacology. 1986, 18 (1), 19-21). Turmeric has been found to have significant anti-inflammatory activity both in acute and chronic models. The therapeutic dose of turmeric, for optimal activity if used alone, is reported to be in the range of 5 to 10 grams of dry powder daily (Patwardhan, U.S. Patent No. 5,494,668). This dosage level, however, can produce a feeling of nausea.<br>
Curcumin not only has anti-inflammatory properties but also has anti¬oxidant, anti-tumor and other valuable properties. When used in low concentrations, curcumin can inhibit nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and, therefore, inhibit nitric oxide production. For example, Brouet et al. (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 1995, Jan. 17; 206 (2); 533-40) have reported that NOS activity in soluble extracts of macrophages activated for 6-24 hours in the presence of curcumin (10 microM) was significantly lower that that of macrophages activated without curcumin. Northern-blot and immunoblotting analyses demonstrated that significantly reduced levels of the mRNA and 130-k Da protein of inducible NOS<br><br>
were expressed in macrophages activated with curcumin, compared to those without curcumin activation. Inhibition of NOS induction was maximal when curcumin was added together with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and decreased progressively as the interval between curcumin and LPS/IFN-garnma was increased to 18 hours.<br>
Ginger (Zingiber officinale)<br>
Native to southern Asia, ginger is a 2- to 4-foot perennial that produces grass-like leaves up to a foot long and almost an inch wide. Ginger root, as it is called in the grocery store, actually consists of the underground stem of the plant, with its bark-like outer covering scraped off.<br>
Chinese medical texts from the fourth century B.C. suggest that ginger is effective in treating nausea, diarrhea, stomach aches, cholera, toothaches, bleeding, and rheumatism. Ginger was later used by Chinese herbalists to treat a variety of respiratory conditions, including coughs and the early stages of colds.<br>
Ginger's modern use dates back to the early 1880s, when a scientist named D. Mowrey noticed that ginger-filled capsules reduced his nausea during an episode of flu. Inspired by this, he performed the first double-blind study of ginger. Germany's Commission E subsequently approved ginger as a treatment for indigestion and motion sickness. Ginger has become widely accepted as a treatment for nausea. Even some conventional medical texts suggest ginger for the treatment of the nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, although others are more cautious.<br>
Ginger gives relief from muscular discomfort and pain. It inhibits prostaglandin and leukotriene biosynthesis and histamine release. Thus it acts as an anti-inflammatory as well as an antacid agent. It is a dual inhibitor of the lipoxigenase and cycloxigenase system. Ginger contains 1-4% essential oil (oleoresin)., Used alone fresh Ginger is required to be used in substantially high doses (50 grams daily), which is not only inconvenient but can act as an irritant to the gastric mucosa. In dry form for any significant results, 7 to 10 grams of dry<br><br>
ginger powder has to be taken daily. Such large doses of ginger are extremely inconvenient for the patient and affect patient compliance on a daily basis. (See Potwardhan, U.S. Patent No. 5,494,668.)<br>
Horseradish (Armoracia rusticana)<br>
Horseradish, a perennial herb (Armoracia rusticana, but sometimes classified in other genera) of the family Cruciferae (mustard family), is native to Central and Southern Europe where it has long been cultivated in gardens and naturalized in many parts of North America. It is grown mainly for its roots, which formerly were used medicinally, particularly as an antiscorbutic. Horseradish is also an excellent diuretic, and is good for digestion problems. Herbalists combine horseradish and honey for coughs and asthma treatments. Externally, it is sometimes used to alleviate the pain and stiffness caused by rheumatism.<br>
Friedman, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,248,504 and 5,385,734, has used horseradish to treat nasal and sinus dysfunction. Attempts have also been made to provide oral horseradish remedies for certain ailments. Mays, U.S. Patent No. 98,875, relates to a medical compound for alleviating asthma, coughs and colds. The compound includes pulverized horseradish. Diets, U.S. Patent No. 74,205, discloses a medical compound containing horseradish for the treatment of consumption.<br>
Slippery Elm (Ulmus rubra)<br>
Slippery elm trees are native to North America. Slippery Elm has been employed in traditional herbal medicine for over 100 years. The dried inner portion of the slippery elm bark has been used both by Native Americans and early settlers. Slippery Elm is a nutritious food that was made into a type of pudding for those who had weak stomachs. Slippery Elm is soothing to irritated tissues and has been used in poultices for its ability to encourage healing in wounds. Slippery Elm nourishes the adrenal glands, gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory system. It helps the body expel excess mucus. Other conditions, for which slippery elm is used, include: abscess, broken bones, burns and scalds, cholera, colitis, constipation in<br><br>
children, debility, diaper rash, diarrhea in children, diverticulitis, dysentery, hemorrhoids, hiatal hernia, indigestion, labor pain, leprosy and sore throat.<br>
Green Tea (Camellia sinensis)<br>
Green tea is the dried leaves and leaf buds of the shrub Camellia sinensis. It is mainly produced in China and Japan. Dried tea leaves are composed mainly of phytochemicals known as polyphenols (36%), principally flavonols (including catechins), fiavonoids, and flavondiols. The leaves also contain plant alkaloids (about 4%), including caffeine, theobromine and theophylline. Much of the research on green tea has been focused on its potential to prevent cancer. Research suggests that the polyphenols in green tea are responsible for a chemopreventive effect (E. Kaegj Canadian Medical Association Journal, 1998, 158: 1033-35).<br>
It is an object of certain embodiments of the present invention to provide a nutritional supplement to promote the health of salivary glands and/or to support normal or healthy swallowing.<br>
It is a further object of certain embodiments of the present invention to provide a composition for treating sialorrhea.<br>
It is still a further object of certain embodiments of the present invention to provide a composition for treating some common types of inflammation such as sore throat, congestion, laryngitis and mucous membrane inflammation.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In a first aspect, the present invention relates to a nutritional supplement. The nutritional supplement may be employed for the purpose of providing nourishment. Alternatively, the nutritional supplement of the present may provide some additional benefits such as promoting the health of salivary glands and/or supporting normal or healthy swallowing. The nutritional: supplement of the present invention includes ingredients, which can be obtained from turmeric, ginger, and horseradish.<br>
By "nutritional" or "nutritional supplement" as used herein is meant that the supplements used in the practice of this invention provide a nourishing amount of one or more ingredients derived from turmeric, ginger and horseradish.<br>
As used herein the term "flavors" includes both fruit and botanical flavors. As used herein the term "sweeteners" includes sugars, for example, glucose, sucrose and fructose. Sugars also include high fructose corn syrup solids, invert sugar, sugar alcohols including sorbitol, and mixtures thereof. Artificial sweeteners are also included within the scope of the term, "sweetener."<br>
As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable" means a component that is suitable for use with humans and/or animals without undue adverse side effects (such as toxicity, irritation, and allergic responses), commensurate with a reasonable risk/benefit ratio. Further, as used herein, the term "safe and effective amount" refers to the quantity of a component, which is sufficient to yield a desired therapeutic response without undue adverse side effects (such as toxicity, irritation, or allergic responses), commensurate with a reasonable risk/benefit ratio when used in the manner described herein.<br>
Each of turmeric, ginger, or horseradish contain active ingredients which may provide some beneficial effect in promoting the health of salivary glands, supporting normal or healthy swallowing, and/or treating one or more symptoms including symptoms of a common cold, a sore throat, congestion, laryngitis, mucositis and mucous membrane inflammation. Turmeric and ginger may further serve as COX-2 inhibitors to treat certain types of inflammation such as that due to<br><br>
arthritis. However, the taste of each of turmeric, ginger, or horseradish at an effective dosage level may be too overpowering for a patient. It has been found that the- combination of materials, which can be obtained from turmeric, ginger and horseradish, in the nutritional supplement of the present invention provides a substantial beneficial effect, as well as favorable taste characteristics which make the nutritional supplement palatable.<br>
T'he first ingredient of the nutritional supplement of the present invention may be obtained from turmeric. The yellow pigment of the rhizome of turmeric is composed of three compounds known as curcuminoids. The three curcuminoids are curcumin (diferuioylmethane), desmethoxycurcumin (hydroxycinnarnoyl feruloylmethane), and bis-desmethoxycurcumin (dihydroxydicinnamoyl methane) (see Drug Analysis by Chromatography and Microscopy, p. 169, Ann Arbor Science Inc., 1973). The essential oils of turmeric (curcuma longa) are primarily composed of the following compounds: d-camphor (1%), cyclo-isoprenemyrcene (85%), and p-tolylmethylcarbinol (5%), (see E. Gunther, The Essential Oil, pp. 123-4, Van Nostrand Co., 1955).<br>
The first ingredient of the nutritional supplement of the present invention, obtained from turmeric, preferably includes curcuminoids, such as curcumin (diferuioylmethane), desmethoxycurcumin (hydroxycinnarnoyl feruloylmethane), and bis-desmethoxycurcumin (dihydroxydicinnamoyl methane).- and mixtures of two or more of these curcuminoids.<br>
Methods for isolating curcuminoids from turmeric are known, (see Janaki and Bose, An Improved Method for the Isolation of Curcumin From Turmeric, J. Indian Chem. Soc. 44:985 (1967)). Alternatively, curcuminoids for use in the present invention can be prepared by synthetic methods.<br>
The first ingredient, which can be obtained from of turmeric, can be incorporated into the nutritional supplement of the present invention in a variety of different forms. Those different forms preferably include extracts of turmeric such as turmeric powder extracts, turmeric fluid extracts, one or more the curcuminoid compounds, and turmeric powder, parts of, or whole plants of turmeric, tinctures<br><br>
thereof, and mixtures thereof. More preferably, the first ingredient is a turmeric extract.<br>
The second ingredient of the nutritional supplement of the present invention may be obtained from ginger (also commonly called ginger root). Ginger inhibits prostanoid synthesis and also products of 5-lipoxygenase. The potency of the ginger extract in the acute inflammation test appears to be comparable to that exhibited by acetyl salicylic acid reported in the same study. (Mascolo N. et al Journal of Ethnopharmocology. 1989. 27,129-140).<br>
One of the features of inflammation is increased oxygenation of arachidonic acid, which is metabolized by two enzymic pathways—the cyclooxygenase (CO) and the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO)-leading to the production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes respectively. It is suggested (Srivastava and Mustafa; Medical Hypotheses, 1992, 39 342-348) that at least one of the mechanisms by which ginger shows its ameliorative effects could be related to inhibition of prostaglandin and leukotriene biosynthesis, i.e. it works as a dual inhibitor of eicosanoid biosynthesis.<br>
Ginger contains 1-4% essential oil (oleoresin). Many chemical investigations have been carried out on the constituents of the essential oil of ginger. All together more than 200 different volatiles have been identified in the essential oil of ginger. The essential oil of ginger contains a mixture of various terpenes as well as some other non-terpenoid compounds.<br>
The active compounds of ginger which may be employed in the present invention include, but are not limited to, 1,8-cineole, 10-dehydrogingerdione, 10-gingerol, 6-gingerdione, 6-gingerol, 6-shogaol, 8-(3-17-epoxy-X-trans-12-ene-15,16-diol, 8-gingerol, 8-shogaol, 9-oxo-nerolidol, acetaldehyde, acetic acid, alanine, a-linolenic-acid, a-linolenic acid, a-phellandrene, a-piene, a-terpinene, a-terpineol, a-zingiberene, ar-curcumene, arginine, ascorbic acid, asparagine, P-bisabolol, (3-carotene, (3-elemene, j3-eudesmol, (3-ionone, (3-myrcene, {3-phelIandrene, (3-pinene, (3-selinene, P-sesquiphellandrene, P-sitosterol, P-thujone, bomyl-acetate, boron, caffeic acid, calcium, camphene, camphor, capric acid, caprylic acid, capsaicin,<br><br>

Also, mixtures of two or more of these active compounds may be employed.<br>
The second ingredient of the nutritional supplement of the present invention, which may be obtained from ginger, can be incorporated in the nutritional supplement of the present invention in many different forms including extracts such as ginger powder extracts, ginger fluid extracts, ginger powder including ginger root powder, and one or more active compounds of ginger, parts of, or whole ginger plants, tinctures thereof, and mixtures thereof. Also, for any specific active compound of ginger for which suitable synthesis routes are known, the active compound can be prepared synthetically. Preferably, the second ingredient of the nutritional supplement of the present invention is selected from ginger extract, and ginger root powder.<br>
A third ingredient of the nutritional supplement of the present invention may be obtained from horseradish, also commonly called horseradish root. Horseradish's pharmacological activities are mainly due to its active compounds. The active compounds of horseradish which may be useful in the present invention include, but are not limited to, allyl-isothiocyanate, amylase, arginine, ascorbic acid, asparagine, gentisic acid, kaempferol, limonene, niacin, p-hydroxy-benzoic acid, pectin, phenylpropyl-isothiocyanate, quercetin, raphanin, riboflavin, rutoside,<br><br>
selenium, sinapic acid, sinigrin, tannin, thiamin, vanillic acid and zinc, as well as mixtures of two or more of these compounds.<br>
The third ingredient of the nutritional supplement of the present invention, which may be obtained from horseradish, can be included in the nutritional supplement in many different forms. Those different forms include horseradish powder, horseradish extracts such as horseradish powder extracts and horseradish fluid extracts: one or more active compounds of horseradish, parts of, or whole plants of horseradish, tinctures thereof, and mixtures thereof. For a particular active compound, for which a synthetic route is known, the active compound may be obtained synthetically. Preferably, the third ingredient of the nutritional supplement of the present invention is selected from horseradish powder and horseradish extract.<br>
All active compounds of the present invention may be obtained from other sources, if available. Thus, the phrase "which can be obtained from1' or the phrase "which may be obtained from" is meant to encompass compounds or nutritional supplements that are obtainable from turmeric, ginger, horseradish, slippery elm or green tea and therefore encompasses synthetic forms of the same compounds and/or compositions as well as the same compounds and/or compositions obtained from other sources.<br>
The ingredients of the nutritional supplement of the present invention, which may be obtained from turmeric, ginger and horseradish, may be used in the forms of turmeric powder, ginger powder, and horseradish powder, each of which may be ground from the rhizome of turmeric, ginger root and horseradish root respectively. Alternatively, turmeric powder, ginger powder, horseradish powder, and/or one or more of the active compounds contained therein may be purchased from commercial sources such as Delavau Co. Alternatively, the ingredients of the present invention can be used in the form of turmeric extract, ginger extract and horseradish extract, which may be extracted from each of turmeric rhizome, ginger root and horseradish roots using common extraction procedures. One suitable extraction procedure is described below.<br><br><br>
The extraction procedure comprises, generally, the steps of:<br>

1)	cleaning the roots of turmeric to remove any foreign matter thereon;<br>
2)	particulating the roots to obtain a particulate mass having particle size ranging from 0.001 to about 10 mm3;<br>
3)	subjecting the particulate mass to distillation to obtain a volatile fraction, if any, from the particulate mass;<br>
4)	cooking the distilled particulate mass in a polar solvent, such as water to solubulize material in the distillation-treated particulate mass to obtain first solution and a first residue;<br>
5)	filtering the first solution from the first residue;<br>
6)	evaporating the filtrate obtained from the first solution to remove the solvent and obtain a solute designated as fraction A obtained from the particulate mass;<br>
7)	subjecting the first residue to treatment with a second polar solvent such as 75% to 95% ethanol for twelve to thirty-six hours to obtain a second solution and a second residue;<br>
8)	filtering the second solution from the second residue to obtain a second filtrate;<br>
9)	evaporating the second filtrate to remove its solvent and obtain a solute designated as fraction B obtained from the particulate mass;<br><br>
 	subjecting the second residue to less polar or non-polar solvents,<br>
such as petroleum ether, for twelve to thirty-six hours to obtain a third<br>
solution and a third residue, and filtering the third solution from the<br>
third residue to obtain a third filtrate;<br>
	evaporating the third filtrate to remove its solvent and obtain a solute<br>
designated as fraction C obtained from the particulate mass; and<br>
	homogeneously mixing the volatile fraction, with fractions A, B and C<br>
from the particulate mass to obtain a beneficiated plant extract.<br>

Two patients, who suffer from sialorrhea caused by ALS, ingested 1-2 lozenges of Example 1 every day for a three-week period. It was found that the ingestion of the lozenges effectively controlled excessive secretions of saliva in these two patients. In both patients, excessive drooling was also significantly reduced.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 4      In Vitro Testing of Virucidal Activity of the Nutritional Supplement The in vitro testing protocol for virucidal activity employed in this example uses human rhinovirus 16 (hereafter "HRV-16") as the target virus, and the MRC-5 cell line related to human tissues described by Jacobs, et al, Characteristics of Human diploidMRC-5, Nature (London), 227, pi68-170 (1970) as the host cell for the HRV-16 viruses. Residual virus infectivity following incubation of the test substances with the virus was titrated on the MRC-5 cell line for rhinovirus growth by visually scoring the cytopathic effect (CPE) induced by virus replication through microscopic observation. More specifically, CPE was scored by observing ballooning/rounded cells in the MRC-5 culture.<br>
To determine the virucidal activity, the nutritional supplement composition of Example 1 (hereafter "Substance I"), was employed at an initial dilution of 1/20 and then further diluted by serial dilutions in saline. The diluted compositions were incubated with HRV-16 for a set time period and then the reaction was terminated by adjustment to a neutral pH with cell infection media. The resultant solution was then titrated out on MRC-5 cells at a dilution of 1/10 across a testing plate to carry out the infection of the cells. Each plate housed a virus control, which contained only HRV-16 infected MRC-5 cells, and a cell control, which contained only uninfected MRC-cells.<br>
The plates were further incubated for 4 days after the infection. Residual viral infectivity was measured using the assay discussed above. From the results shown in Tables 1-4, all of the controls on the plate worked well.<br>
From the assay, it was concluded that Substance 1, at a 1/20 dilution, was effective in producing an HRV-16 viral log reduction of 1.50 (-log 10 TCID50) at the 1-minute incubation period. A 1/40 dilution of Substance 1.produced a log reduction of 1.00 (-log 10 TCID50) also at the 1-minute incubation period. After the 2-minute and 5-minute incubation periods, 1/2 log reductions in HRV-16 titre were achieved. Therefore, these results tend to indicate that a 1-minute contact time between Substance 1 and HRV-16 would produce the most effective viral titre reduction.<br><br>

As one can see from above results, Substance 1 is effective in inhibiting or exterminating influenza viruses and human rhinoviruses. As a result, Substance 1 should be effective in treating influenza and common colds.<br>
  Example 5 In Vitro Testing of Virustatic Activity of the Nutritional Supplement<br>
The in vitro testing protocol for virucidal activity employed in this example used human rhinovirus 16 (HRV-16) as the target virus, and the rhinovirus sensitive Hela cell line related to human tissues described by Conant et al, Basis for a numbering system. I. Hela cells for propagation and serologic procedure, J.     Immunol., 100, pl 07-113 (1968) as the host cell for the HRV-16 virus.<br><br>
The nutritional supplement of Example 1, Substance 1, was dissolved in infection media to the following dilutions: 1/20, 1/40, 1/80, 1/160 and 1/320. These dilutions were incubated on plates of MRC-5 cells for 30 minutes at 37°C (5% CO2). After the incubation period, each Substance 1 dilution with MRC-5 cells in a well of the plates was subjected to HRV-16 at a known titre of 2.30 (-log 10 TCID50). Each plate housed a virus control (the Hela cells infected with HRV-16 viruses and without Substance 1), a cell control (Hela cells only) and the test compound controls at the different dilutions (Hela cells with the test substance only). All the other samples on the plate contained the Hela cells infected with lp    HRV-16 viruses and Substance 1 at different dilutions. The plates were further incubated for 4 days after infection.<br>
Residual virus infectivity following incubation of Substance 1 with the virus was titrated on the Hela cell line for rhinovirus growth by measuring the cytopathic effect (CPE) induced by the virus using the following procedure.<br>
The remaining viable Heia ceils after incubation with Substance 1 were stained with crystal violet solution. Excess crystal violet was removed by washing and the crystal violet stained cells were solubilized using a mixture of methanol and acetic acid. The absorbance of the solution was then measured at 540 nm in an ELISA plate reader. The level of virus induced CPE was inversely proportional to 2p    the absorbance.<br>
The results generated from the crystal violet assay enabled the toxic concentration and the effective concentration of Substance 1 to be determined by fitting an equation, y = rax + c, wherein x corresponds to the dilution of Substance 1 and y corresponds to percentage of toxicity of Substance 1 to the cells. From this 2|5 z    equation, the TC50 (concentration at which Substance 1 indicates 50% toxicity to the cells) is at a 1/571 dilution of Substance 1.<br>
This result correlates well with the percentage of cell survivors at various dilution of Substance 1, which was also measured using the crystal violet assay, as shown in Table 14 below.<br><br><br>
Dilution of<br>
Substance 1<br>
without Virus	% Cell Survivors<br>
1?320	89.7<br>
1/160	94.6<br>
1/80	97.6<br>
1/40	109.3<br>
1/20	168.2<br>
Table 14<br>
Using the same equation, wherein x still corresponds to the dilution of Substance 1 and y corresponds to the percent efficacy of Substance 1 in the presence of the virus, the EC50 (concentration at which the test substance indicates 50% efficacy in the presence of virus) was determined to be at a 1/91 dilution of Substance 1. This result correlates well with the percentage of viable cells at l|0    various dilutions of Substance 1 measured using the crystal violet assay, as shown in Table 15 below.<br><br>
Substance 1 dilution and Virus	% Viable Cells<br>
1/320 + HRV-16	79.3<br>
1/160 + HRV-16	62.3<br>
1/80 + HRV-16	39.0<br>
1/40 + HRV-16	15.9<br>
1/20 + HRV-16	-220.0<br>
Table 15<br>
In Tables 14 and 15, % Cell Survivors = (Compound only /Cell only) x 100; and % Viable Cells = (Cell only - Compound + Virus) / (Cell only - Virus only)x 100.<br><br><br>
"Compound only" denotes the measurement results for the wells containing only Hela ceils and Substance 1 at a predetermined dilution.<br>
"Cell only" denotes the measurement results for the wells containing only uninfected Hela.cells.<br>
"Compound + Virus" denotes the measurement results for the wells containing both the Hela cells infected with HRV-16 viruses and Substance 1 at a predetermined dilution.<br>
"Virus Only" denotes the measurement results for the wells containing the Hela cells infected with HR.V-16 only.<br>
