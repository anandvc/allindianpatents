				<td>Improved enzymes<br>
The present invention provides modified enzymes with higher GTP cyclohydrolase n activity than the respective -wild-type enzymes. The modified enzymes and polynucleotides encoding the same can be used for the production of riboflavin, riboflavin precursors, flavin mononucleotide (FMN), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and derivatives thereof.<br>
Riboflavin (vitamin B2) is synthesized by all plants and many microorganisms but is not produced by higher animals. Because it is a precursor to coenzymes such as flavin adenine dinucleotide and flavin mononucleotide that are required in the enzymatic oxidation of carbohydrates, riboflavin is essential to basic metabolism. In higher tmirrwis insufficient riboflavin can cause loss of hair, inflammation of the skin, vision deterioration, and growth failure.<br>
Engineering of riboflavin production strains with increased rates and yields of riboflavin has been achieved in the past in a number of different ways. For instance, (1) classical mutagenesis was used to create variants with random mutations in the genome of the organism of choice, followed by selection for higher resistance to purine analogs and/or by screening for increased production of riboflavin. (2) Alternatively, the terminal enzymes of riboflavin biosynthesis, i.e., the enzymes catalyzing the conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and ribulose-5-phosphate to riboflavin, were overexpressed, resulting also in a higher flux towards the target product However, in this latter approach, strong overexpression' of the riboflavin biosynthesis proteins imposes an additional metabolic burden on the host cells which may, in turn, induce stress response reactions and other undesirable negative effects on the cells' physiology.<br><br>
The enzymes required catalyzing the biosynthesis of riboflavin from guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and ribulose-5-phosphate are encoded by four genes (ribG, ribBy ribA, and ribH) in B. subtilis. These genes are located in an operon, the gene order of which differs from the order of the enzymatic reactions catalyzed by the enzymes. For example, GTP cyclohydrolase n, which catalyzes the first step inriboflavin biosynthesis, is encoded by the third gene in the operon, ribA. The ribA gene also encodes a second enzymatic activity, i.e.t 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate synthase (DHBPS), which catalyzes the conversion of ribulose-5-phosphate to the four-carbon unit 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate (DHBP). Deaminase and reductase are encoded by the first gene of the operon, ribG. The pennltimate step in riboflavin biosynthesis is catalyzed by lumazine synthase, the product of the last rib gene, ribH. Riboflavin synthase, which controls the last step of the pathway, is encoded by the second gene of the operon, HbB. The function of the gene located at the 3' end of the rib operon is, at present, unclear; however, its gene product is not required for riboflavin synthesis.<br>
Transcription of the riboflavin operon from the ribPl promoter is controlled by an attenuation mechanism involving a regulatory leader region located between ribPl and ribG. The ribO mutations within this leader region result in deregulated expression of the riboflavin operon. Deregulated expression is also observed in strains containing nrissense mutations in the ribC gene. The ribC gene has been shown to encode the flavin kinase/FAD syntiiase of B. subtilis (Mack, M., et al., J. Bacteriol., 180:950-955,1998). Deregulating mutations reduce the flavokinase activity of the ribC gene product resulting unreduced intracellular concentrations of fJavrnmononucleotide (FMN), the effector molecule of me riboflavin regulatory system.<br>
'Recently, Â£adlhts subtilis was'genetically engineered'to-produce high yieWfiCofriboflavin . during a short fennentation cycle (U.S. Patent No. 5,837,528). This approach combined classical genetic mutant selection and fennentation improvement with genetic engineering of the riboflavin biosynthetic genes by deregulating and increasing the level of gene expression. In this system, the expression of the rib genes was increased "by mutating the flavokinase encoding ribC gene, by linking the rib genes to strong, constitutive promoters, and by increasing the copy number of the rib genes.<br>
As already discussed above, overexpression of the rib genes poses an additional burden on the production strains which, may, potentially, have a negative impact on the production of riboflavin precursors, riboflavin, FMN, FAD, or their derivatives. In order to circumvent this shortcoming, it is a subject of thepresent invention to describe GTP cyclohydrolase E mutants with increased specific activity. Use of such mutant enzymes in production strains, either alone or combined with improved mutants of the other Rib proteins, will allow higher flux rates with less or no additional burden on the cells' metabolism.<br><br>
As used herein, the term "GTP cyclohydrolase E" may include any enzyme that is capable of catalyzing the conversion of GTP to 2,5-diamino-6-ribosylamino-4 (3H)-pyrimidanone-5'-phosphate (DRAPP).

It is in general an object of the present invention to provide an enzyme having GTP cyclohydrolase n activity, said enzyme being modified in a way that its catalytic properties are more favorable (i.e., showing higher specific activity) than those of the non-modified GTP cyclohydrolase IE enzymes.<br>
The invention relates to a modified GTP cyclohydrolase n which exhibits higher (specific) activity in comparison to the corresponding non-modified GTP cyclohydrolase H â¢wherein (i) the BTTri-rxn acid sequence of me modified GTP cyclohydrolase H contains at least one - mutation,wieri compared within amino acid sequence of the corresponding non-modified<br>

The "specific activity" defines the amount of substrate consumed and/or product produced in a given time period and per defined amount of protein at a defined temperature. Typically, "specific activity" is expressed in ftmol substrate consumed or product formed per min per mg of protein. Typically, pnrd/min is abbreviated by U (= unit). Therefore, the unit definitions for specific activity (mg of protein) or U/(mg of protein) are used interchangeably throughout this document It is understood that in the context of the present invention, specific activity must be compared on the basis of a similar, or preferably identical, length of the p' chain.

The present invention, includes further the provision of a method for the preparation of a GTP cyclohydrolase E having increased specific activity, comprising the following steps:<br>
(a)	providing a polynucleotide encoding a first GTP cyclohydrolase n with a specific<br>
activity that, desirably, should be increased;<br>
(b)	providing the positions that have an effect on the specific activity,<br>
(c)	defining the optimal ammo acid for replacement of a given amino acid of the wild-type<br>

In one embodiment, step (c) or the method described above is performed via saturated mutagenesis. However, it is understood that this may be not the only way to define the amino acid which should replace an amino acid at a given position of the wild-type GTP cyclohydrolase H in order to obtain a modified GTP cyclohydrolase n with increased specific activity.<br>
The preparation of a modified GTP cyclohydrolase n having increased specific activity from a non-modified GTP cyclohydrolase Has described above, e.g., via saturated mutagenesis, includes, but is not limited to, the preparation of mutated GTP cyclohydrolase II proteins from non-modified proteins as of Figure 1 or in Table 4, in particular those identified by SEQ ID NOs:2,33,35,37,39,41, and 43, such as for example non-modified GTP cyclohydrqlase n proteins of Bacillus subtilis arAshbya gossypii. The primers used for thePCR reaction are such that oneprirner, e.gv, the sense   -primer, may contain a mutated nucleotide sequence and the other primer, e.g., the anti-sense primer, may contain the wild-type nucleotide sequence. PCR with these primer pairs and genomic DNA of the wild-type ribA may result in a PCR product carrying the particular mutation at a given position, depending on the mutated nucleotide sequence of the primer used. After purification of the resulting PCR products using standard methods like, e.g., the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), the DNA may be cut with restriction enzymes such as BamHI and^coRI, ligated into a suitable vector, e.g.} pQE60, and transformed into a strain which is negative for GTP cyclohydrolase IL An example for such a strain is meÂ£. coli strain Rib? (Richter et al, J. BacterioL 175,4045-4051,1993) containing the plasmid pREP4. After confirmation of the correct sequence by DNA sequencing, the mutated RibA maybe purified and characterized as described above. If Ashbya gossypii is used for the generation of a GTP cyclohydrolase H having increased<br><br>
specific activity, saturated mutagenesis has to be performed at amino acid residues/positions T126, G135, A141, LI44, N182 and 1221 corresponding to the respective residues V261, G270, A276, Q279,.K308 and M347 of Bacillus subtilis GTP cyclohydrolase n as of SEQ ID NO:2 that were shown to have an impact on the specific activity of the latter enzyme (see Table 4).<br>

The numbering used for those positions is done according to the B. subtilis wild-type amino acid sequence. The figure starts with the name of the sequences used, the database accession number, and in parenthesis the source organism of the sequence.<br>
The following non-limiting examples further illustrate the invention.<br>
Example 1:   Measurement of GTP cyclohydrolase n activity and determination of specific activity<br>
The enzymatic assay used for measuring GTP cyclohydrolase E activity was adapted from Rite et al (J. Biol. Chem. 276,22273-22277,2001). The final assay buffer contained 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.5,10 mM MgCl2,7.5 mM mercaptoethanol, 2.5 mM GTP and 0.1 nag/ml bovine serum albumin. After purification (see Example 5), the enzyme was kept in<br><br>
a buffer containing 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.5,10 mM MgCb, 7.5 mM mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol. Substrate was added to the enzyme and the absorption at 310 nm, at which GTP shows no absorption, was followed over 20-30 rain. The final reaction mixture contained between 0.02 and 0.04 nag/ml GTP cyclohydrolase n from J. subtilis or one of the mutants as shown in Table 1 or 2, An absorption coefficient of 6.28 [mM"1 cm" l] for DRAPP was used for tiie calculation of the activity. Protein determination was done with the Protein Assay from Bio-Rad (Cat No. 500-0002, Bio-Rad Laboratories AG, Nenzlingerweg 2, CH-4153 Reinach, Switzerland).<br>
According to the definition of "specific activity" given above, one unit is the amount of RibA that catalyzes the formation of 1 jumol DRAPP per minute under the conditions as described above. The specific activity is the amount of DRAPP that is formed by 1 mg of RibA per minute under the conditions as described above. Using the aforementioned definitions, the specific GTP cyclohydrolase H activity of the Hiss-tagged RibA protein of JB. subtilis was 0.115 U/mg.<br>
Example 2:    Testing of the quality of the enzymatic assay<br>
An optimal assay should fulfill a number of requirements, such as linearity with enzyme concentration and linearity with time. Using the conditions described in Example 1 and 22 /ig enzyme, the increase in the absorption at 310 nm was followed over 25 min. To test in which range the assay is linear with the enzyme concentration, the dependence of the assay on increasing enzyme concentration (0-40 /ig Hise-tagged RibA) was tested. The assay proved to be linear over 25 min and between 0 and 40 jtg Base-tagged RibA from B. subtilis.<br>
After this the dependence of therGTP'cyclohydrolase II activity oÂ£SiS6Â»tagged-RibA-from -B. subtilis on GTP concentration was tested. The conditions as described in Example"1" were used. However, the GTP concentration was varied from 0.05 to 2.5 mM final concentration. The data indicate a-Kin value for GTP of 0.07 mM and a specific activity of around 115 mU/mg protein at 37Â°C for the GTP cyclohydrolase n activity of the Hasg-tagged RibA enzyme from B. subtilis. The experiments of this example showed that the GTP cyclohydrolase H activity assay, in fact, is linear with time and enzyme (GTP cyclohydrolase H) concentration, and that under the given conditions for Bacillus subtilis GTP cyclohydrolase H, a GTP concentration of 2.5 mM maybe optimal to allow reliable measurements of the specific activity of the enzyme.<br>
Example 3:   Isolation of genomic DNA from Bacillus subtilis<br>
B, subtilis was grown at 30Â°C in Veal Infusion Broth (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD 21152, USA) overnight. 1.5 ml culture was transferred into a 1.5 ml tube and â¢centrifuged.<br><br>
The cell pellet was resuspended in 0,5 ml suspension buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaEDTA, 15% sucrose and 1 nag/ml freshly added lysozyme). After 10 mm incubation at room temperature 1 /xl diethyloxydiformate was added. Then 10 /il of 10% SDS solution was added and the tube was inverted several times. The tube was incubated for 5 min at 70Â°C to release the bacterial DNA. 50 (il 5 M potassium acetate was added, the tube was cooled on ice and left there for 45 min. After this, the sample was centrifuged for 30 min at 4Â°C. The supernatant was transferred into a new 1.5-ml tube, which was filled (up to 1.5 ml) with ethanol at room temperature. After 5 mm centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded and the DNA pellet was dried. Then the DNA was washed with 70% and 96% ethanol and dissolved in 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5,1 mM EDTA, and 10 jug/ml RNase A,<br>
Example 4:    Construction of the expression plasmids for expressing ribA coding for GTF cyclohydrolase n and DHBP synthase from B, subtilis and its mutants<br>
Cloning of the ribA gene (SEQ ID NO:1) of B. subtilis that codes for the GTP cyclohydrolase II and the DHBP synthase was done by PCEL Genomic DNA of B. subtilis was isolated according to Example 3. 100 ng of this DNA or of a template coding for a mutated form of the ribA gene were used for.aPCR using primers RibA IS (SEQ ID NO:27) and RibA IAS (SEQ ID NO:28). The following PCR conditions were used: 2 fiM of each primer, 0.2 mM of each nucleotide, 2.5 U of a proof-reading DNA polymerase (Stratagene, Gebouw California, 1101 CB Amsterdam Zuidoost, The Netherlands), and 100 ng genomic DNA in the appropriate buffer as supplied together with the DNA polymerase.<br>
Temperature regulation was as follows:<br>
Stepl:	3minat95Â°C<br>
Step 2:	30secat95Â°C<br>
Step 3:	30secat52Â°C<br>
Step 4:	60secat72Â°C<br>
Steps 2 to 4 were repeated 3 0-times.<br>
The PCR product of 1.3 kb was used as template for PCR 2, in which primer RibA 1S was replaced by primer RibA 2S (SEQ ID N0:29). The PCR product of this reaction (SEQ 3D NO:3), encoding an N-terminally Hise-tagged version of B. subtilis RibA (SEQ ID NO:4), was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, eluted from the gel, digested with EcoKL and BamlSi, and ligated into the .EcoRI and BaniHl digested vector pQE60 (Qiagen AG, Hilden, Germany). The plasmid was called pQE60rlbANlhis.<br><br>
Example 5:    Characterization of the wild-type and the mutant enzymes<br>
The generation of mutated enzymes was performed using methods described above and which are known to the skilled person. Mutants of RibA from B. subtilis that were further investigated are depicted in Table 1. All mutant genes were cloned into a pQE60 vector as described in Example 4. All final constructs contained an N-terminal Hisg-tag.<br>
Table 1: Rib A mutants as defined by the amino acid exchanges compared to the wild-type RibA protein of B. subtilis (the numbers define the respective amino acid positions in SEQ E&gt;NO:2)(Table Remove)  The RibA mutant enzymes were expressed from the plasmids of Example 4 and purified as described in "The QiaExpressionist", Qiagen, HUden, Germany, March 2001, edition 5. The enrymatic properties of the purified enzymes (RibA mutants) were analyzed as described in Examples 1 and 2. Table 2 compares the specific GTP cyclohydrolase H activities of the RibA mutants (see Table 1) to that of the GTP cyclohydrolase H of the wild-type RibA of B. subtilis. The activity was measured using the N-terminally Jffis6-<br>
tagged enzyme versions of Rib A as described in Example 4. The numbers define the respective arnino acid positions in SBQ ID NO:2.<br>

The amino add replacements in parentheses have most probably no effect-on GTP cyclohydrolase n activity of me mutants. Amino acid exchange Y196C reduces the ~" protease sensitivity of RibA.<br>
Example 6:    Construction of recombinant B. subtilis strains over-expressing RibA mutants that show a higher specific GTP cyclohydrolase EL activity<br>
In the following example, the mutated ribA polynucleotide sequences of RibA Y196C^276TA282T (PCRID), RfcA Y196C,A276T,Q279R^282T,K308RM347I (construct C), and RibA Y196CrA276T,Q279R^282T^308RrF325Y,M347I (construct E) were first introduced into a vector containing the strong constitutive promoter T?vegi, and then further manipulated in E. coli. Transformation of a natural competent JB. subtilis microorganism with the polynucleotide sequence and flanking vector sequences resulted in a B. subtilis strain over-expressing the mutated ribA. Standard recombinant DNA techniques were used for the construction of the polynucleotide sequjjjce sad the B.<br><br>
subtilis strains. See, for example, Sambrook et at., Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual (2nd Ed.), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1989), andHarwood and Cutting, Molecular Biology Methods for Bacillus, John Wiley and Sons (1990).<br>
To amplify the mutated ribA, a 1.2-kb DNA fragment containing the entire ribA coding sequence was amplified by PCR using DNA from a plasmid containing mutants PCR TIT, construct C or construct E, and RibANde+1 (SEQ ID NO:30) and RibA4AS (SEQ ID NO:31) as primers.<br>
The reaction conditions for the PCR reaction consisted of 30 cycles of denaturation at 95Â°C for 1 min, annealing at 52Â°C for 1 min, and extension at 72Â°C for 2 mm  The Pfii Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, Gebouw California, 1101 CB Amsterdam Zuidoost, The Netherlands) was used to minimize PCR-generated errors. The PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), and doubly digested rising NdeL and BamHL The digested PCR products were cloned into the pXI16 vector (Huembelin et al, J. hid. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 22,1-7,1999), which consists of suitable restriction sites for the cloning of polynucleotide sequences immediately downstream of the strong constitative Py^ promoter from B. subtilis. The pXI16 vector also contains the cryT transcriptional terminator from B. thuringiensis, the sacB flankhig sequences for homologous recombination into the B. subtilis genome by a double-crossover event, and an erythromycin-xesistance marker. That each plasmid contained the mutated ribA was confirmed by DNA sequencing.<br>
Each plasmid was digested with Apal to remove the spacer region from the Pvegr promoter, re-ligated and digested again withFjpI, and transformed into natural competent B. subtilis 1012 cells. Transformants were selected on TBAB plates (Tryptose Blood Agar Base,<br>
Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD 21152, USA) containing erythromyein to a final concentration of 2 jKg/ml. DNA sequencing verified that the mutated ribA polynucleotide sequences were correct in these strains. Overproduction of riboflavin was tested according to Example 7.<br>
The mutated ribA polynucleotide sequences driven by the PV^ promoter were introduced into riboflavin over-producing .B. subtilis straiaRB50::(pRP69)n::(pRF93)m, which has been described in Perkins et al, J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 22:8-18 (1999), by generalized transduction. Standard techniques using bacteriophage PBS1 were employed according to Harwood and Cutting, Molecular Biology Methods for Bacillus, John Wiley and Sons (1990). Transductants were selected for on TBAB plates containing erythromyein to a final concentration of 2 jig/ml. Transformants were checked by PCR analysis and DNA sequencing to verify correct insertion of the mutated ribA polynucleotide sequence.<br><br>
Example 7:    Improved production of riboflavin using a GTP cyclohydrolase n with increased specific activity<br>
To test the in  effect of mutations affecting the specific activity of GTP cyclohydrolase n, the Bacillus subtilis GTP cyclohydrolase H (RibA) mutants PCR m, construct C, or construct E were introduced into riboflavin over-producing B. subtilis strains, such, as strain RB50::(pKF69y,:j-pRF93)m (Perkins et al, J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 22, 8-18, 1999), e.g. in the sacB locus. The production of riboflavin was compared directly in two recombinant strains of B. subtilis that differ only by the presence or absence of the mutations in the ribA gene. Culturing of the Bacillus strains was done as described in Example 8.<br>
Example 8:    Culture conditions for evaluating riboflavin production<br>
Riboflavin production was tested in fed-batch cultivations of ribofLavin-overproducing B. subtilis strain RB50::(pRF69)n::(pRF93)inin which the GTP cyclohydrolase II mutants PCR HL, construct C, or construct E driven by the ?vegi promoter were integrated in the sacB locus (see Example 6). Fermentation of the strains was done as described in EP 405370.<br>
Example 9:   Analytical methods for determination of riboflavin<br>
For determination of riboflavin, the following analytical method can be used (Bretzel et al, J. Ind. McrobioL Biotechnol, 22,19-26,1999).<br>
The chromatographic system was a Hewlett-Packard 1100 System equipped with a binary pump; a column thermostat and a poolei.atttQsampleri,;B.pth a^ode^arrayjdetector and a fluorescence detector were used in line. Two signals wereTecorded, TJV at 280 nm and-a -fluorescence trace at excitation 446 nm, emission 520 nm,<br>
A stainless-steel Supelcosil LC-8-DB column (150 x 4.6 mm, 3 (an. particle size) was used, together with a guard cartridge. The mobile phases were 100 mM acetic acid (A) and methanol (B). A gradient elation according to the following scheme was used: <br>
(Table Remove) The column temperature was set to 20Â°C, and the flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. The run time was 25 min.<br>
Fermentation samples were diluted, filtered and analyzed without further treatment. RLboflavin was quantitated by comparison with an external standard. The calculations were based on the UV signal at 280 nm. Riboflavin purchased from Fluka (9471 Buchs, Switzerland) was used as standard material (purity Â£ 99.0%).<br>
Example 10: Identification of corresponding residues in GTP cyclohydrolase n<br>
enzymes that are homologous to Bacillus subtilis GTP cyclohydrolase n<br>
A multiple amino acid sequence alignment of 92 different GTP cyclohydrolase n enzymes found by the program BLASTN using standard databases such as SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL (see Figure 1) was calculated with the program "PILETJP" (GCG Wisconsin Package, version 10.2, Accelrys Inc., 9685 ScrantonRoad, San Diego, CA 92121-3752, USA) using the following parameters: gap creation penalty 8, gap extension penalty 2, and blosum62.cmp matrix (default parameters).<br>
A homologous GTP cyclohydrolase H in the context of the present invention may show sequence similarity with any of the GTP cyclohydrolase IE amino acid sequences shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 provides an example of a multiple sequence alignment of 92 GTP cyclohydrolase II amino acid sequences, with the sequence of the GTP cyclohydrolase n    â¢ from Bacillus subtilis being underlined. Figure 1 just serves as an example and is not meant to be a complete collection of all known GTP cyclohydrolase n enzymes.
