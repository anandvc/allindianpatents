Specification:<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a fission reactor for a Claus plant, comprising a boiler lined with refractory<br>
material, which comprises a combustion chamber having an inflow opening for a mixture of<br>
heating gas, air and acid gas containing H2S, a catalyst chamber having a catalyst bed, and a<br>
chamber on the outflow side, having a gas outlet for hot process gas containing elemental sulfur.<br>
BACKGROUND/PRIOR ART<br>
In a Claus plant, hydrogen sulfide is converted to elemental sulfur, which is condensed and<br>
precipitated by means of cooling the process gas stream. In its fundamental structure, a Claus<br>
plant consists of the fission reactor described initially, a waste heat boiler, as well as at least one<br>
catalyst stage. An acid gas containing H2S is guided into the combustion chamber of the fission<br>
reactor, together with air heating gas. Here, about 60-70% of the hydrogen sulfide is converted to<br>
sulfur in an exothermic reaction on the catalyst bed. The process gas leaves the fission reactor at a<br>
temperature of about 1200°C, and<br>
is cooled to a temperature below 170°C in the waste heat boiler. After precipitation of the<br>
condensed sulfur, the process gas is heated again and passed to the catalyst stage, in which<br>
hydrogen sulfide that is still contained in the process gas is converted to elemental sulfur, at a<br>
working temperature below 300°C.<br>
DE-A-3708957 discloses a reactor having a catalyst bed for the catalytic conversion of H2S and<br>
SO2 present in a gas stream into elemental sulphur. For the said conversion, when operating the<br>
reactor below the dew point of sulphur or the solidification point of sulphur, as high a uniformity<br>
as possible in the cooling or heating of the catalyst charge in the case of adsorption or<br>
regeneration, the reactor is at least partially cooled or heated internally and at least one<br>
cooling/heating coil is arranged in at least one part of the catalyst bed. It is here also provided that<br>
the catalyst bed is divided into a number of sub-beds containing different catalysts.<br>
WO-A-01/09032 discloses a method and system for improving the yield of syngas from the partial<br>
oxidation of methane or other light hydrocarbons. The increase in yield results from the<br>
substitution of H2S partial oxidation for the combustion of light hydrocarbon to CO2 and water.<br>
Within the scope of the known measures, a vertical shaft oven that has a combustion chamber at its<br>
upper end and a bed of a loose catalyst bulk material below the combustion chamber is used as a<br>
fission reactor. The oven, through which flow passes from top to bottom, possesses a great height.<br>
For reasons of stability, a complicated oven scaffolding is required in order to absorb the wind<br>
stress that acts on the oven. Furthermore, there is the problem that flames can flash over from the<br>
combustion chamber to the catalyst bed, thereby damaging the catalyst.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is based on the task of reducing the expenditure, in terms of plant technology, for<br>
the fission reactor of a Claus plant. The fission reactor is supposed to function reliably, while<br>
having a compact structure.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
To accomplish this task, the invention teaches that the boiler is configured as a horizontal<br>
cylindrical boiler, in which the combustion chamber, the catalyst chamber, and the chamber on the<br>
outflow side are disposed next to one another, and that the catalyst chamber is delimited, on both<br>
sides, in the flow direction, by gas-permeable checker bricks, and has a fill opening for introducing<br>
the catalyst bed, on the mantle side. Preferably, the inflow opening and the gas outlet are disposed<br>
on opposite faces of the boiler. The invention is based o the recognition that a horizontal<br>
arrangement of the fission reactor can be implemented if the catalyst bed is introduced into a<br>
catalyst chamber delimited on both sides by gas-permeable checker bricks. Significant advantages<br>
result from the arrangement according to the invention. The fission reactor can be configured to be<br>
compact, having a short combustion chamber, since the gas-permeable checker bricks made of a<br>
refractory material effectively prevent flash-over of flames from the combustion chamber all the<br>
way to the catalyst bed. Furthermore, because of the horizontal arrangement of the boiler, static<br>
problems in setting up the fission reactor are eliminated. An oven scaffolding to absorb wind<br>
stresses is not necessary. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the checker bricks<br>
made of refractory material contain elongated<br>
holes that cannot become blocked up by the catalyst, which are generally spherical.<br>
In another embodiment of the fission reactor, the invention teaches that on the circumference of<br>
the chamber on the outflow side, a branch line lined with refractory material is connected, which<br>
opens into a process gas line adjacent to the boiler, through which a cooler process gas flows. In<br>
the opening region of the branch line, a valve body is disposed in adjustable manner, with which<br>
the amount flow of a hot gas stream that exits from the branch line can be regulated. In this<br>
connection, the cooler process gas that passes through the process gas line cools the valve body<br>
and a setting device assigned to the valve body, so that usual metallic materials can be used for the<br>
valve body and the setting device.<br>
Other embodiments are described in the subordinate claim 5 and are described in the following,<br>
using an exemplary embodiment.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The drawing schematically shows:<br>

Fig. 2 the fission reactor in a representation that is enlarged as compared with Fig. 1.<br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO THE<br>
ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Hydrogen sulfide is converted to elemental sulfur in the Claus plant shows in Fig. 1. The<br>
fundamental structure of the plant includes a fission reactor 1 having a combustion chamber 2 and<br>
a catalyst bed 3, a waste heat boiler 4 connected with the gas outlet of the fission reactor 1, as well<br>
as at least one catalyst stage 5. An acid gas 6 containing hydrogen sulfide, along with air 7 and<br>
heating gas 8, is introduced into the combustion chamber 2 of the fission reactor 1. In an<br>
exothermic reaction, part of the hydrogen sulfide is converted to elemental sulfur on the catalyst.<br>
The process gas leaves the fission reactor 1 at a temperature of approximately 1200°C, and is<br>
cooled to a temperature of less than 170°C, which is required for condensation of the sulfur, in the<br>
waste heat boiler 4. The condensing sulfur is precipitated. After precipitation of the sulfur, the<br>
cooled process gas is heated and passed to the catalyst stage 5, in which sulfur compounds are<br>
converted to elemental sulfur on a catalyst. The catalyst stage 5 is operated at a temperature of less<br>
than 300°C. The process gas leaving the catalyst stage 5 is also cooled to the temperature<br>
required for condensation of the sulfur, in the waste heat<br>
boiler 4, and the condensed sulfur is precipitated. ,<br>
It is evident from a comparison of Figures 1 and 2 that the<br>
fission reactor 1 consists of a horizontal, cylindrical boiler 9,<br>
lined with refractory material, in which boiler the combustion<br>
chamber 2, a catalyst chamber 10 for the catalyst bed 3, as well<br>
as a chamber 11 on the outflow side are disposed next to one<br>
another. An inflow opening 12 for a mixture of heating gas, air,<br>
and acid gas containing H2S, as well as a gas outlet 13 for a hot<br>
process gas containing elemental sulfur are disposed on the<br>
opposite faces of the boiler 9. The catalyst chamber 10 is<br>
delimited, on both sides, by gas-permeable checker bricks 14<br>
made of refractory material, and has a mantle-side fill opening<br>
15 for introduction of the catalyst bed. It is practical if the<br>
checker bricks 14 contain elongated holes. A branch line 16<br>
lined with refractory material is connected on the circumference<br>
of the chamber on the outflow side, which line opens into a<br>
process gas line 17 adjacent to the boiler. The process gas<br>
line 17 connects the gas outlet of the waste heat boiler 4 with<br>
the catalyst stage 5, and has a process gas flowing through it,<br>
which exits from the waste heat boiler 4 at a temperature of<br>
less than 170°C, and is heated to a working temperature between<br>
210°C and 250°C before entry into the catalyst stage 5. The<br>
heating takes place by mixing in hot process gas that flows in<br>
through the branch line 16. In the opening region of the branch<br>
line 16, a valve body 18 is disposed, in adjustable manner, with<br>
which the amount flow of the hot gas stream exiting from the<br>
branch line 16 can be regulated. The valve body 18 and a<br>
setting device 19 assigned to the valve body are cooled by the<br>
cooler process gas that flows through the process gas line 17,<br>
so that usual metallic materials can be used.<br>
The fission reactor furthermore has cleaning and inspection<br>
openings 20, as well as an access 21 for a temperature<br>
measurement device.<br>
The waste heat boiler 4 has a steam generator chamber surrounded<br>
by a pressure-resistant mantle, to which chamber a feed device<br>
22 for boiler feed water as well as an exhaust device 23 for<br>
low-tension steam are connected. The waste heat boiler 4<br>
contains a long tube bundle of heat exchanger tubes, which<br>
extend through the steam generator chamber and are inserted, on<br>
both ends, into tube plates that delimit the steam generator<br>
chamber. Furthermore, at least one additional tube bundle of<br>
shorter heat exchanger tubes is provided, which are also<br>
inserted into the tube plate at their exit-side end, and open<br>
into an inflow chamber 24 at the entry-side end. The long tube<br>
bundle has a hot process gas that exits from the fission reactor<br>
flowing through it. The inflow chamber 2 4 is disposed within<br>
the steam generator chamber and is impacted by a cooler process<br>
gas from the catalyst stage 5. The waste heat boiler 4<br>
furthermore has a head piece 25 that follows the tube plate on<br>
the exit-side end, and is divided into sections. Each section<br>
of the head piece 25 has a tube bundle assigned to it, in each<br>
instance. Devices for drawing off condensed sulfur are<br>
connected with the sections.<br>
