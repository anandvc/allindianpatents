				<td>CEMENTED CARBIDE BODY CONTAINING ZIRCONIUM AND NIOBIUM<br>
AND METHOD OF MAKING THE SAME<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention provides sintered cemented carbide bodies<br>
having increased resistance to plastic deformation comprising tungsten carbide<br>
(WC), a binder metal phase and one or more solid solution phases comprising at<br>
least one of the carbides, nitrides and carbonitrides of at least one of the elements<br>
of groups IVb, Vb and VIb of the Periodic Table of Elements. The present<br>
invention also provides a method for producing these sintered cemented carbide<br>
bodies. These sintered cemented carbide bodies are useful in the manufacture of<br>
cutting tools, and especially indexable cutting inserts for the machining of steel<br>
and other metals or metal alloys.<br>
[0002] Sintered cemented carbide bodies and powder metallurgical<br>
methods for the manufacture thereof are known, for example, from U.S. Patent<br>
Re. 34,180 to Nemeth et al.. While cobalt has originally been used as a binder<br>
metal for the main constituent, tungsten carbide, a cobalt-nickel-iron alloy as<br>
taught by U.S Patent No. 6,024,776 turned out to be especially useful as a binder<br>
phase for tungsten carbide and other carbides, nitrides and carbonitrides of at least<br>
one of the elements titanium, zirconium, hafnium, vanadium, niobium, tantalum,<br>
chromium, molybdenum and tungsten, respectively.<br>
[0003] Numerous attempts have been made in order to modify the<br>
properties or characteristics of the sintered cemented carbide bodies prepared by<br>
powder metallurgical methods. These properties include, but are not limited to,<br>
hardness, wear resistance, plastic deformation at increased temperatures, density,<br>
magnetic properties, resistance to flank wear and resistance to cratering. In order<br>
to provide cutting tools having improved wear properties at high cutting speeds, it<br>
is known, for example, that the sintered cemented carbide bodies should have<br>
increased contents of titanium or tantalum and niobium. On the other hand,<br>
however, it is known that increasing contents of titanium or tantalum or niobium<br>
result in a noticeable reduction of strength as they form solid solution carbides<br>
with tungsten carbide, since the amount of tungsten carbide-phase which provides<br>
for the maximum strength in a sintered cemented carbide body decreases with the<br>
formation of solid solution carbides.<br>
[0004] Also well known to those skilled in the art is the fact that the<br>
addition of zirconium and hafnium increases the strength of sintered cemented<br>
carbide bodies both at room temperature and at higher temperatures. However, the<br>
increase in strength is combined with lower hardness and decreased wear<br>
resistance. In addition, a disadvantage of the addition of zirconium is its high<br>
affinity to oxygen and its poor wettability which impedes the sintering process<br>
used in the preparation of the sintered cemented carbide body.<br>
[0005] U.S. Patents Nos. 5,643,658 and 5,503,925, both hereby<br>
incorporated by reference herein, aim at improving hot hardness and wear<br>
resistance at higher temperatures of sintered cemented carbide bodies by means of<br>
adding zirconium and/or hafnium carbides, nitrides and carbonitrides to the<br>
powder mixture of tungsten carbide and a binder metal of the iron family. As a<br>
result thereof, the hard phases of at least one of zirconium and hafnium coexist<br>
with other hard phases of metals of groups IVb, Vb and VIb, but excluding<br>
zirconium and hafnium, with said hard phases forming, in each case, solid<br>
solutions with tungsten carbide. Due to the high affinity of zirconium for oxygen,<br>
either the starting powder materials have to be extremely low in oxygen, or the<br>
oxygen content has to be controlled by using a reducing sintering atmosphere.<br>
[0006] JP-A2-2002-356734, published on December 13, 2002, discloses<br>
a sintered cemented carbide body comprising WC, a binder phase consisting of at<br>
least one metal of the iron group, and one or more solid solution phases, wherein<br>
one of said solid solution phases comprises Zr and Nb while all solid solution<br>
phases other than the first one comprise at least one of the elements Ti, V, Cr, Mo,<br>
Ta and W, but must not comprise Zr and Nb. According to this Japanese patent<br>
document, the best cutting results are achieved at a tantalum content of less than<br>
1% by weight of the total composition, calculated as TaC.<br>
[0007] The present invention aims at achieving new sintered cemented<br>
carbide bodies having increased resistance to plastic deformation at increased<br>
temperatures and, as a result thereof, having increased wear resistance. Besides,<br>
the present invention aims at providing a powder metallurgical method of<br>
producing said sintered cemented carbide bodies. More specifically, it is an object<br>
of the present invention to provide a sintered cemented carbide body having at<br>
least two co-existing solid solution phases containing zirconium and niobium or<br>
one single homogenous solid solution phase containing zirconium and niobium.<br>
[0008] Another object of the present invention consists in providing a<br>
method of producing said sintered cemented carbide body comprising the step of<br>
providing a powder mixture which upon sintering provides at least two co-existing<br>
solid solution phases or one single homogenous solid solution phase containing, in<br>
each case, zirconium and niobium, and providing improved sintering activity and<br>
wettability with hard constituents of elements of groups IVb, Vb, and VIb of the<br>
periodic table of elements.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0021] Referring to FIG. 1, there is shown a cutting tool, i.e., a sintered<br>
cemented carbide body, generally designated as 20. Cutting tool 20 has a rake<br>
face 22 and flank faces 24. There is a cutting edge 26 at the intersection of the<br>
rake face 22 and the flank faces 24. The cutting tool 20 further contains an<br>
aperture 28 by which the cutting tool 20 is secured to a tool holder. The style of<br>
cutting tool shown in FIG. 5 is a CNMG style of cutting tool. The illustration in<br>
FIG. 1 of a CNMG style of cutting tool should not be considered to limit the scope<br>
of the invention. It should be appreciated that the present invention is a new<br>
cemented carbide material that can be used as a cutting tool wherein the geometry<br>
of the cutting tool can be any known cutting tool geometry.<br>
[0022] In regard to the composition of the cutting tool, i.e., a sintered<br>
cemented carbide body, the composition contains tungsten carbide and a binder,<br>
as well as one or more solid solution phases that comprise the carbides and/or the<br>
carbonitrides of a combination of zirconium, niobium and tungsten as exemplified<br>
by the formulae (Zr,Nb,W)C and/or (Zr,Nb,W)CN. In one preferred embodiment<br>
of the composition, just one of the solid solution phases consists of a carbide or<br>
carbonitride of a combination of zirconium, niobium and tungsten. In another<br>
preferred embodiment of the composition, the solid solution phase consisting of a<br>
carbide or carbonitride of a combination of zirconium, niobium and tungsten is the<br>
sole solid solution phase of the body wherein no other element such as titanium,<br>
hafnium, vanadium, tantalum, chromium, and molybdenum is present in said solid<br>
solution phase.<br>
[0023] In yet another preferred embodiment of the composition, one of<br>
the solid solution phases comprises a carbide or carbonitride of a combination of<br>
zirconium, niobium and tungsten and at least one carbide, nitride or carbonitride<br>
of one or more of titanium, hafnium, vanadium, tantalum, chromium, and<br>
molybdenum wherein the solid solution phase may be either the sole solid<br>
solution phase of the body or one of two or more different solid solution phases.<br>
More specifically, there can be two or more different solid solution phases that are<br>
present with each solid solution phase comprising a carbide or carbonitride of a<br>
combination of zirconium, niobium and tungsten, and at least one carbide, nitride<br>
or carbonitride of one or more of titanium, hafnium, vanadium, tantalum,<br>
chromium and molybdenum, respectively. In those cases where the solid solution<br>
phase comprises a carbide or carbonitride of a combination of zirconium, niobium<br>
and tungsten, and at least one carbide, nitride or carbonitride comprising one or<br>
more other metals, it is even more preferred that said at least one other metal is<br>
one or more of titanium, tantalum and hafnium.<br>
[0024] According to the present invention, the binder alloy preferably<br>
comprises cobalt, a CoNi-alloy or a CoNiFe-alloy, each of which may or may not<br>
contain additional alloying elements such as chromium and tungsten. The binder<br>
alloy preferably comprises between about 3 weight percent to about to 15 weight<br>
percent of the total body.<br>
[0025] Preferably, the total contents of a carbide or carbonitride of a<br>
combination of zirconium, niobium and tungsten of the one or more solid solution<br>
phase(s) comprise between about 1 weight percent and about 15 weight percent of<br>
the total body. Also preferred are those embodiments of the present invention<br>
wherein the total content of the elements titanium, hafnium, vanadium, tantalum,<br>
chromium and molybdenum does not exceed about 8 weight percent of the total<br>
body. According to especially preferred embodiments of the present invention,<br>
titanium comprises between about 1 weight percent and about 8 weight percent of<br>
the total body, tantalum comprises between about 1 weight percent and about 7<br>
weight percent of the total body, and hafnium comprises between about 1 weight<br>
percent and about 4 weight percent of the total body.<br>
[0026] If the cemented carbide body has a mass ratio Nb/(Zr + Nb) of<br>
greater than about 0.5, and more preferably greater than or equal to about 0.6, the<br>
formation of a single homogeneous solid solution phase or the formation of two or<br>
more coexisting solid solution phases within the sintered cemented carbide body<br>
is remarkably increased.<br>
[0027] According to still another aspect of the present invention, the<br>
sintered cemented carbide body comprises at least one of said nitrides or<br>
carbonitrides and comprises an outermost zone being free of any solid solution<br>
phase but binder enriched up to a depth of about 50 micrometers (µm) from an<br>
uncoated surface of said body. Embodiments of this type are shown in FIGS. 4<br>
and 5 hereof.<br>
[0028] As is acknowledged by those having ordinary skill in the art,<br>
binder enrichment and formation of a surface zone free of solid solution carbide<br>
(SSC) is induced during sintering once at least one nitride or carbonitride is<br>
present in the starting powder mixture. Due to the formation of free nitrogen<br>
during sintering, diffusion of binder metal from the bulk towards the surface, and<br>
diffusion of solid solution phase from the surface zone towards the bulk will take<br>
place, resulting in a binder enriched surface zone being free of any solid solution<br>
phase. Due to these diffusion processes, two or more coexisting different solid<br>
solution phases showing a concentration gradient between the surface and the<br>
center of the body are formed underneath of the binder enriched zone, according<br>
to a still more preferred embodiment of the present invention. In those cases,<br>
however, where just one single solution phase being homogeneous throughout the<br>
body is present, said one single and homogeneous solid solution phase will be<br>
located underneath of the binder enriched zone such that the single solid solution<br>
phase is homogeneous throughout said body, except in the binder enriched zone.<br>
[0029] According to still other preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, one or more wear resistant layers deposited according to well-known<br>
physical vapor deposition (PVD) or chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods<br>
are coated over a surface of the sintered cemented carbide body. Preferably, these<br>
wear resistant coatings comprise one or more of the carbides, nitrides,<br>
carbonitrides, oxides or borides of a metal of the groups IVb, Vb and Ylb of the<br>
periodic table of elements, and alumina.<br>
[0030] Referring to the method aspects of the present invention,<br>
according to a preferred embodiment of the method of the present invention, a<br>
solid solution of a carbide or carbonitride of a combination of zirconium and<br>
niobium having a mass ratio Nb/(Zr + Nb) of greater than about 0.5, and<br>
preferably greater than or equal to about 0.6 or more, is used as the powdered<br>
solid solution of a carbide or carbonitride of a combination of zirconium and<br>
niobium. The powdered solid solution of a carbide or carbonitride of a<br>
combination of zirconium, niobium and tungsten preferably comprises between<br>
about 1 weight percent and about 15 weight percent of the total powder mixture.<br>
[0031] Preferably, cobalt powder, powders of cobalt and nickel or<br>
powders of cobalt and nickel and iron or powders of a cobalt-nickel alloy or<br>
powders of a cobalt-nickel-iron alloy are used as the binder metal powders, within<br>
the method of the present invention. Optionally, the binder metal powders may<br>
include additional elements, preferably one or more of chromium and tungsten.<br>
Preferably, the binder metal powder comprises between about 3 weight percent<br>
and about 15 weight percent of the total powder mixture. <br>
[0032] According to still another embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the powder mixture additionally comprises at least one carbide, nitride or<br>
carbonitride of one or more of titanium, hafnium, vanadium, tantalum, chromium,<br>
and molybdenum. Preferably, the powder mixture comprises at least one of the<br>
elements titanium, hafnium, vanadium, tantalum, chromium and molybdenum in<br>
an amount of between about 1 weight percent and about 8 weight percent of the<br>
total powder mixture.<br>
[0033] The present inventors have surprisingly found that due to the<br>
addition of zirconium and niobium in the form of a powdered solid solution of a<br>
carbide or carbonitride of a combination of zirconium and niobium to the starting<br>
powder mixture, instead of using zirconium carbide plus niobium carbide or<br>
zirconium carbonitride plus niobium carbonitride, each individually, either one<br>
single homogeneous solid solution phase comprising the carbides and/or the<br>
carbonitrides of a combination of zirconium, niobium and tungsten, or two or<br>
more coexisting solid solution phases comprising the carbides and/or the<br>
carbonitrides of a combination of zirconium, niobium and tungsten, and at least<br>
one carbide, nitride or carbonitride of one or more of titanium, hafnium,<br>
vanadium, tantalum, chromium and molybdenum, depending on the compounds<br>
added to the starting powder mixture, are formed during sintering according to the<br>
method of the present invention.<br>
[0034] Contrary to the documents mentioned herein above, upon<br>
sintering all elements added to the starting powder mixture are dissolved in each<br>
one of the coexisting solid solution phases, according to the present invention.<br>
For example, up to about 65 weight percent tungsten, up to about 75 weight<br>
percent niobium, up to about 60 weight percent zirconium, up to about 20 weight<br>
percent titanium, up to about 15 weight percent tantalum, and up to about 20<br>
weight percent hafnium can be dissolved in the coexisting solid solution phases.<br>
[0035] Another advantage of the use of a powdered solid solution of a<br>
carbide or carbonitride of a combination of zirconium and niobium as part of the<br>
starting powder mixture according to the present invention is the fact that<br>
tantalum can be added to the composition for improving binder phase distribution<br>
and toughness in an amount of about 1 weight percent or more of the total starting<br>
powder mixture. <br>
[0036] The best results in terms of homogeneity of the solid solution<br>
phase(s) formed according to the present invention have been obtained if a<br>
powdered solid solution of a carbide or carbonitride of a combination of<br>
zirconium and niobium having a ratio of about 40 weight percent zirconium<br>
carbide and about 60 weight percent niobium carbide was added to the starting<br>
powder mixture.<br>
[0037] Referring to FIG. 2A and FIG. 2B, each one of these figures is a<br>
photomicrograph at 1500X (each photomicrograph as a 10 micrometer scale) that<br>
shows the unetched microstructures of two samples; namely, Sample (A) and<br>
Sample (B), respectively. Sample (A) was produced according to the present<br>
invention using (Zr,Nb)C in the starting powder mixture and whereas Sample (B)<br>
was conventionally made by using individual carbides; namely, ZrC and NbC<br>
instead of (Zr,Nb)C in the starting powder mixture. FIG. 2A shows that Sample<br>
(A) has a porosity of less than A02 and FIG. 2B shows that Sample (B) has a<br>
porosity of A08. In addition, as can be seen in FIG. 2A, the microstructure of<br>
Sample (A) obtained by using the (Zr,Nb)C solid solution in the starting powder is<br>
much more homogeneous in terms of porosity as compared with the<br>
microstructure (see FIG. 2B) of Sample (B), which is the conventionally prepared<br>
sintered cemented carbide body using ZrC + NbC as part of the starting powder<br>
mixture.<br>
[0038] Referring to FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B, these figures are<br>
photomicrographs of sintered bending strength test rods wherein each is in cross<br>
section. FIG. 3B shows the microstructure of Sample (B) that is made in a<br>
conventional fashion using ZrC and NbC in the starting powder mixture wherein<br>
there is a sinter distortion that can be seen very clearly. FIG. 3 A shows the<br>
microstructure of Sample (A) that was made according to the present invention<br>
using a solid solution carbide of zirconium and niobium (Zr,Nb)C wherein FIG.<br>
3A does not show sinter distortion. This comparison shows that, with respect to<br>
sinter distortion, Sample (A) is much better with the present invention than with<br>
the conventional sample (B).<br>
[0039] As indicated earlier, a further advantage of using a powdered<br>
solid solution of a carbide or carbonitride of a combination of zirconium and<br>
niobium as part of the starting powder mixture consists in the lower affinity to<br>
oxygen, as compared to conventional methods of producing sintered cemented<br>
carbide bodies, whereby it is not necessary to have a reducing sintering<br>
atmosphere. Due to the avoidance of any controlling and monitoring of the<br>
reducing quality of the sintering atmosphere, sintering becomes easier and less<br>
expensive according to the present invention as compared to the prior art.<br>
[0040] Referring to FIG. 4, FIG. 4 is a photomicrograph of an<br>
embodiment of the sintered cemented carbide body of the present invention<br>
wherein there is shown a binder enriched surface zone free of solid solution<br>
carbide and one single homogeneous solid solution phase (MC). FIG. 4 shows<br>
that the present invention allows the production of sintered cemented carbide<br>
bodies having one single homogeneous solid solution phase.<br>
[0041] Referring to FIG. 5, FIG. 5 is a photomicrograph of an other<br>
embodiment of the sintered cemented carbide body of the present invention<br>
wherein there is shown a binder enriched surface zone free of solid solution<br>
carbide. Underneath the binder enriched surface zone free of solid solution phase<br>
there is shown a zone in which a solid solution phase MC1 exists. MC1 is light<br>
brown. Underneath the zone containing only MC1 solid solution phase, there is a<br>
zone that contains two coexisting solid solution phases. One solid solution phase<br>
is MC land it is light brown. The other solid solution phase is MC 2 and it is dark<br>
brown. FIG. 5 shows that the present invention allows the production of sintered<br>
cemented carbide bodies having different coexisting solid solution phases (MC1;<br>
(MC1+MC2)) visible by optical microscopy located underneath an outermost<br>
binder enriched zone being free of solid solution phase.<br>
[0042] Further details of the invention shall be described through the<br>
following examples. Table 1 sets forth the raw materials that were used in the<br>
examples that are set forth hereinafter.<br>
Table 1 - Raw Materials Used for the Examples<br>
[0043] In regard to the processing of the examples, for each one of the<br>
examples the specified raw materials were wet milled in an attritor for 10 hours<br>
and dried. Green compacts were pressed of the resulting powder mixtures and<br>
sintered according to the sintering conditions stated in the examples. In the<br>
examples the percentages are given in weight percent unless otherwise stated.<br>
[0044] As is well known to those skilled in the art of powder metallurgy,<br>
the element pairs tantalum and niobium as well as zirconium and hafnium in most<br>
cases of occurrence are associated with each other such that a complete separation<br>
often is difficult to obtain. This is why in commercial applications, small amounts<br>
or traces of niobium will be present in tantalum, and vice versa, and small<br>
amounts or traces of zirconium will be present in hafnium, and vice versa. This<br>
also is valid for the present disclosure, whenever these elements or compounds<br>
thereof are mentioned by their names or chemical formulae.<br>
Example 1:<br>
[0045] Powder mixtures A and B having the compositions (weight<br>
percent) given in Table 2 were prepared. TRS bars (ISO 3327, type B) were<br>
pressed from these powder mixtures to form green compacts. The compacts were<br>
sinter-HIPped at temperatures between 1430 and 1520 degrees Centigrade. The<br>
resulting sintered cemented carbide bodies were metallurgically tested. The results<br>
of these tests are shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B and FIGS. 3A and 3B. Sample A<br>
(according to the present invention) shows a porosity of <a02 fig.></a02>
whereas sample B (prior art comparative example) shows a high residual porosity<br>
(see FIG. 2B) and strong sinter distortion (see FIG. 3B).<br>
Table 2 - Starting Powder Mixtures for Samples (A) and (B) (weight percent)<br><br>
The resulting sintered cemented carbide bodies of Sample (A) and Sample (B) had<br>
the following properties as reported in Table 3 below.<br>
Table 3 Selected Properties for Sample (A) and Sample (B)<br><br>
In regard to the columns of Table 3, the density is reported in grams per cubic<br>
centimeter, the magnetic saturation is reported in . 1 micro testla cubic meter per<br>
kilogram, the coercive force (Hc) is reported in oersteds, the hardness is reported<br>
as a Vickers Hardness Number using a 30 kilogram load, and the porosity was<br>
ascertained per a visual inspection. The test methods used to determine the<br>
properties set forth in Table 3, as well as throughout the entire patent application,<br>
are described below. The method to determine density was according to ASTM<br>
Standard B311 -93(2002)el entitled "Test Method for Density Determination for<br>
Powder Metallurgy (P/M) Materials Containing Less Than Two Percent Porosity.<br>
The method used to determine the magnetic saturation was along the lines of<br>
ASTM Standard B886-03 entitled "Standard Test Methods for Determination of<br>
MAGNETIC Saturation (Ms) of Cemented Carbides. The method to determine<br>
coercive force was ASTM Standard B887-03 entitled "Standard Test Method for<br>
Determination of Coercivity (Hcs) for Cemented Carbides. The method to<br>
determine the Vickers hardness was along the lines of ASTM Standard E92-<br>
82(2003)el entitled "Standard Test Method for VICKERS Hardness of Metallic<br>
Materials". The method used to determine the porosity was along the lines of<br>
ASTM Standard B276-91(2000) entitled "Standard Test Method for Apparent<br>
Porosity in Cemented Carbides".<br>

form a standard multilayer coating comprised of titanium carbonitride and<br>
alumina layers. All samples were coated equally. The resulting sintered bodies<br>
had the following properties as set forth in Table 5 below.<br>

(hot hardness) test shows for the sintered bodies according to the present<br>
invention a clearly increased resistance against plastic deformation at higher<br>
temperatures as compared to the prior art.<br>
[0052] The compositions of the solid solution carbide (SSC) phase of<br>
samples C, D, E and F were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM)<br>
with the assistance of EDAX. In samples D, E and F two different SSC-phases<br>
could be identified by optical microscopy, whereas sample C showed one single<br>
SSC-phase, only. Where two different SSC-phases were present, the darker one<br>
was richer in tungsten and lower in zirconium, as compared with the lighter one.<br>
The results of the above determination are reported in Table 9 below that presents<br>

Selected Properties of Samples N and O<br><br>
[0059] An analysis of the sintered bodies revealed that Sample N shows<br>
two different coexisting solid solution phases that were identified by optical<br>
microscopy. By optical microscopy Sample O showed one single homogeneous<br>
solid solution phase. The compositional results of the analysis of Samples N and<br>

*) Thickness of SSCl-zone: about 80 to 120 µm<br>
[0060] The problems of the prior art mentioned above are overcome by<br>
the present invention which provides a sintered cemented carbide body having<br>
increased resistance to plastic deformation, comprising tungsten carbide, a binder<br>
phase comprising at least one metal of the iron group or an alloy thereof, and one<br>
or more solid solution phases each one of which comprising at least one of the<br>
carbides and carbonitrides of a combination of zirconium, niobium, and tungsten.<br>
Further, the problems of the prior art are overcome by the method of the present<br>
invention wherein this method is a method of producing said sintered cemented<br>
carbide body, according to the present invention, comprises the steps of:<br>
(a) providing a powder mixture comprising tungsten carbide, a binder<br>
metal powder comprising at least one metal of the iron group or an<br>
alloy thereof, and at least one of the carbides and carbonitrides of both,<br>
zirconium and niobium;<br>
(b) forming a green compact of said powder mixture;<br>
(c) vacuum sintering or sinter-HIP said green compact at a temperature of<br>
from 1400 to 1560°C;<br>
wherein in step (a) a powdered solid solution of the carbides or carbonitrides of<br>
zirconium and niobium is used to form said powder mixture. The sintered<br>
cemented carbide bodies of the present invention have increased resistance to<br>
plastic deformation, resulting in improved wear resistance and extended life time<br>
of cutting tools produced from said sintered cemented carbide bodies. Besides, a<br>
considerable minimization of porosity and sinter distortion as compared to prior<br>
art sintered cemented carbide bodies, is obtained by the present invention.<br>
[0061] There is also a considerable advantage of the method of the<br>
present invention which, according to a preferred embodiment thereof, uses a<br>
powdered solid solution of (Zr,Nb)C instead of the conventionally used single<br>
carbides ZrC and NbC. This advantage is due to the lower affinity of the solid<br>
solution of (Zr,Nb)C to oxygen that results in that neither a reducing sintering<br>
atmosphere is necessary nor a continuous control of the reducing force of the<br>
sinter atmosphere is necessary.<br>

apparent to those skilled in the art from a consideration of the specification or a<br>
