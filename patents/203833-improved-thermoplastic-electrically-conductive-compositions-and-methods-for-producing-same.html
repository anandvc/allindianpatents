				<td>The characteristic behavior of these materials is the existence of a strongly non-linear relationship between the electrical conductivity and the filler concentration. At low filler loading, the electrical conductivity of the polymeric compound is generally quite low; its magnitude is similar to that of the polymer matrix (IO-16 to 10-11 ohm-1 cm-1). As loading is increased, the conductivity increases sharply by several orders of magnitude over a narrow concentration range, then slowly increases towards the conductivity of the condensed filler powder of the order of 10-4 to 10-1 ohm-1cm-1. This behavior describes an insulator-conductor transition occurring at a critical volume fraction (percolation threshold). This threshold is due to the formation of a chain-like network of particles extending throughout the entire specimen volume and allowing electrical current to flow.<br>
US Patent No..4,169,816 describes an electrically conductive single thermoplastic material composition with a high carbon content, the composition including for each 100 parts of polypropylene-ethylene copoliymer 15 - 30 parts of carbon black, 0.25 to 1 part of silica and 1-10 parts of a fiber reinforcing agent selected from carbon fibers or a mixture of carbon fibers and glass fibers.<br>
US Patent No. 5,004.561 describes another single thermoplastic based electrically conductive composition with a high carbon content, the composition including for each 100 parts of thermoplastic resin selected from the group of polyolefin, polystyrene and acrylonitrite/styrene/butadiene (ABS) copolymer resin, polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) resin, polyphenylene ether and polyamide (PA) resin, 30 - 300 parts of electrically conductive glass fibers, 5-40 parts of carbon black and 5-40 parts of graphite.<br>
Russian Patent No. SU 1,643,568 describes a high carbon based electrical conductive thermoplastic composition in which electrical conductivity is achieved from the dispersion of carbon in the matrix. The composition includes 20-35 weight percent polypropylene. 10-20 weight percent polyamide, 20-30 weight percent carbon black, 10-20 weight percent graphite and 15-20 percent glass fibers.<br>
There are generally two methods for producing electrically conductive thermoplastic articles known in the art. In the slow production rate compression molding method less filler (e.g. carbon black) is required to achieve a desired conductivity, however the mechanical properties of the composition are usually deficient. In the fast production rate injection molding method better mechanical properties are achieved and<br>
2<br><br>
articles having complex geometry can be produced but the amount of conductive filler required is high. One deficiency of compression molding of electrically conductive compounds is that the relatively slow processing is expensive.<br>
A major disadvantage of prior art polymer based compounds for electrostatic dissipation arid EMI shielding applications is the high percentage of conductive additives required to form the conductive polymer compounds resulting in high cost and deficient processability and mechanical properties and also high carbon contamination which is adverse in particular for clean room applications.<br>
3<br><br>
The present invention provides an improved thennoplastic electrically conductive composition.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, the electrically conductive composition includes a first thermoplastic component forming a continuous matrix and a second thermoplastic component having a polarity larger than the polarity of the matrix. The composition also includes fibers being encapsulated in-situ by the second thermoplastic component and forming a network within the matrix and also a carbon black component which is preferentially attracted to the second component due to its higher polarity. The in-situ formation of an encapsulated network, including carbon black, in preferred locations of particles provides an electrically conductive composition.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention, the ratio between the conductive carbon filler and the second component is sufficiently high so that a substantial part of the carbon filler is located at the interface between the second component and the matrix to provide the electrical conductivity. Nevertheless, the overall concentration of carbon is at least an order of magnitude smaller than in the prior art electrically conductive compositions, thus making the compositions of the,present invention advantageous in many applications including clean room applications.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to utilize a fast processing method for producing the thermoplastic electrically conductive compositions of the present invention. Injection molding is used for producing the electrically conductive thermoplastic compositions of the recent inventions while using very low carbon black concentrations and improving the mechanical properties of the composition.<br>
The electrically conductive composition of the present invention includes a matrix including substantially a first thermoplastic component, a second thermoplastic component having a higher polarity than that of the first thermoplastic component, the second component encapsulating a plurality of fibers forming a network of encapsulated fibers within the matrix, and a carbon component preferentially attracted to the second component so as to make the network an electrically conductive network within the matrix.<br>

In a preferred embodiment, the composition includes less than 10 parts per hundred carbon black. In another preferred embodiment, the composition includes less than 30 parts per hundred carbon fibers.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 1. Figure I is a schematic illustration of the electrically conductive multi-component thermoplastic compositions of the present invention.<br>
The electrically conductive multi-component thermoplastic composition, generally referenced 10, includes a matrix 12 formed substantially of a first thermoplastic compound, fibers (such as glass fibers, carbon fibers or organic fibers) and/or mineral filler 14 encapsulated with a second thermoplastic compound 16 having therein and thereon carbon black shown in the SEM micrographs of Figs. 2A-2E. As illustrated in Fig. 1, fibers and/or mineral filler 14 encapsulated with second thermoplastic compound 16 with carbon black thereon, form a conductive network within the first thermoplastic compound matrix 12.<br>
In the preferred embodiments, the first thermoplastic component is a polymer based component, utilizing polyolefm, polystyrene (PS) , acrylonitrile /butadiene//styrene (ABS) terpolymer, polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polycarbonate (PC), PC/ABS, high impact polystyrene (HIPS), with or without an added elastomer component and the second thermoplastic component is polyamide (PA) Polyethylene Vinyl Alcohol (EVOH) copolymer. ABS may also be used as the second thermoplastic component. The fibers may be glass fibers, carbon fibers or organic fibers, such as polyamide fibers. Mineral filler may also be used in composition 10. The mineral filler, such as wollastonite, talc or mica, can substitute a part or all the glass fibers, thereby substantially lowering the compound cost, while maintaining or improving the same physical properties of glass fiber reinforced polymers (see Tables 3C and 3D). Preferably, the elastomer component is a combination of elastomers. The addition of the elastomer component to the compound changes the composition's mechanical properties without significantly affecting its electrical conductivity.<br>
Since the affinity of polyamide, ABS or EVOH 16 to fibers and/or mineral filler 14 is much stronger than to any of the first thermoplastic components, during the melt blending of composition 10 (as described in detail with reference to Fig. 3 hereinbelow). the second thermoplastic component preferentially encapsulates, in situ, fibers and/or<br>
7<br><br>
mineral filler 14, thereby producing a network of encapuslated fibers and/or mineral filler within matrix 12. Moreover, carbon black particles are preferentially attracted to the second thermoplastic component phase and located at the second thermoplastic component (ABS, polyamide or EVOH) matrix interfaces as indicated by reference numeral 15, thereby making the network of encapsulated fibers and/or mineral filler electrically conductive using a much smaller content of carbon black than in the prior art and improving the mechanical properties of composition 10 as described hereinbelow.<br>
Referring to the five Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) micrographs of Figs. 2A - 2E, the network of encapsulated fibers and/or mineral filler and the preferential distribution of carbon black 18 in the second thermoplastic component phase 16 is clearly seen. Figs 2A-2C, which differ in their magnification, are SEM micrographs of encapsulated glass fibers and Fig 2D is a SEM micrograph of encapsulated mineral filler (wollastonite). Fig 2E is a SEM micrograph of a composition comprising a first HIPS based thermoplastic component and glass fibers encapsulated by a second ABS based thermoplastic component.<br>
A particular feature of the present invention is that composition 10 includes much lower concentrations of carbon black than in the prior art for similar levels of electrical conductivities. This is since the electrically conductive carbon black particles form continuous pathways along the interfaces between the second thermoplastic component phase and the matrix (first level of percolation). Moreover, the embedded part of carbon black particles is located within the second thermoplastic 16 (second level of percolation), thereby the formation of the conductive pathways is facilitated. This is further facilitated by the network formed of second thermoplastic component encapsulated fibers and/or mineral filler (third level of percolation). This morphology, developed during the melt blending process, forms due to the strong affinity of the second thermoplastic component to the fibers or filler and of the preferential affinity of carbon black to the second thermoplastic component.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 3 through 5C which illustrate preferred methods for producing the electrically conductive thermoplastic compositions of the present invention. Fig. 3 illustrates the method in general and Figs. 4A - 4D and Fig 5A - 5C illustrate, respectively, alternatives of the method for two non limiting exemplary<br>
8<br><br>
compositions.<br>
The method of Fig. 3 illustrated in a time sequence from left to right comprising the steps of compounding 32, the step of pelletizing 34 and the step of injection molding 36. In one preferred embodiment the step of compounding 32 includes the steps of dry blending of polypropylene with second thermoplastic component indicated by reference numeral 31 followed by melting and melt mixing with the fibersJiller as indicated by-33 and subsequent melt mixing with carbon fibers, carbon black or both. Mineral fibers may be added at steps 31 , 33 or 35. in the non limiting examples described below, the compounding step 32 is conducted on a twin-screw compounder (Berstorf, Germany), at processing temperatures in the range of 200-285°C (corresponding to the melting point of the polymer components) and a screw speed of 55 rpm. The resulting compounds are pelletized (step 34) and then injection molded (step 36) at 200-285°C on a Battenfeld injection molding machine equipped with a three cavity American Standard Testing Material (ASTM) mold (tensile bar, flexural bar and falling dart impact disc).<br>
Figs. 4A - 4D illustrate four preferred alternatives of the method for producing composition 10 whereas the composition includes carbon black as the carbon compound. Figs. 4 A - 4D are illustrated for the non limiting example of a composition 10 comprising 100 parts by weight polypropylene, 12 parts by weight polyamide, 30 parts by weight glass fibers, and 2 parts by weight carbon black.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 4A, carbon black concentrate or carbon black particles, is added in the injection molding stage as indicated by reference numeral 37 rather than in the compounding step 32 resulting in a resistivity of 537 Ohm-cm and flexural modulus of 4819 ±161 MPa.<br>
Fig. 4B illustrates the alternative wherein the carbon black concentrate is dry blended with the polypropylene and polyamide resulting in a resistivity of 432 Ohm-cm and flexural modulus of 4649 ± 32 MPa Fig. 4C illustrates the alternative wherein the carbon black concentrate is added during compounding resulting in a resistivity of 214 Ohm-cm-and flexural modulus of 4491 ± 51 MPa.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 4D glass fibers are dry blended with the polypropylene and polyamide while carbon black concentrate is added during compounding resulting in a resistivity of 431 Ohm-cm and flexural modulus of 3790 ± 63 MPa.<br>
9<br><br>
Figs. 5 A - 5C illustrate three preferred alternatives of the method for producing composition 10 whereas the composition carbon fibers or carbon black and carbon fibers as the carbon compound. Figs. 5A - 5C are illustrated for the non limiting example of a composition 10 comprises 100 parts by weight polypropylene, 12 pans by weight polyamide , 30 parts by weight glass fibers, and 2 parts by weight carbon black and 20 parts by weight carbon fibers.<br>
In the alternative of Fig. 5A both carbon black and carbon fibers are added during the injection molding step resulting in high conductivity (Resistivity of 0.465 Ohm-cm) and high flexural modulus (9770 ± 428 MPa).<br>
In the alternative of Fig. 5B carbon black is dry blended with the polyolefin and polyamide as indicated by step 39 instead of the dry blending indicated by step 31 of the other alternatives while carbon fibers are added (step 35) during compounding resulting in a resistivity of 2 Ohm-cm and flexural modulus of 9550 ± 350 MPa.<br>
In the alternative of Fig. 5C, carbon fibers are added in the compounding stage resulting in resistivity of 8 Ohm-cm illustrates and flexural modulus of 8931 ± 267 MPa.<br>
It will be appreciated that the specific method used to prepare the compounds forming composition 10 for injection molding can be selected from the non limiting embodiments described hereinabove and from many other variations thereof, thereby varying the specific electrical conductivity and mechanical properties (illustrated by the flexural modulus above) of composition 10. In all methods, the present invention provides an electrically conductive thermoplastic composition which provides high electrical conductivity and strong meclianical properties after injection molding.<br>
The following examples illustrate without limitation certain aspects of the present invention.<br>
In all examples, injection molded composite samples (12.6cm x 1.27cm x 0.32cm) were characterized for electrical properties by measuring volume resistivity, according to ASTM D 257 - 93 and ASTM D 4496 - 87, using Keithley instruments. Silver paint was used to eliminate the contact resistance between samples and electrodes. Surface resistivity was measured according to EOS/ESE) S11-11.<br>
The corresponding ASTM test methods were used for the mechanical properties evaluation. Specifically, ASTM D 0538 was used for measuring tensile properties,<br>
to<br><br>
ASTM D 790 was used for measuring flexure, ASTM D 256 was used To measure IZOD impact and ASTM D 570 was used to measure water absorption.<br>
The glass fiber content, mineral filler content and the carbon black content in each specimen was determined by using ASTM D 5630 - 94 and ASTM D 1603 - 94. respectively.<br>
The composites morphology was studied using scanning electron microscopy. Freeze fractured surfaces were studied.<br>
In the experiments, commercial grades of Pp (homopolymer and copolymer), ABS, PS, HIPS, NORYL, PBT and PC (described in detail with reference to Tables 10-13), PE (high and low density grades), elastomer. PA (PA6, PA66, PA 11, PA 12, PA 6/6.9, PA 6/12), EVOH, glass fibers (chopped strands, 3.2-6.3 mm length, 10-13 micrometer diameter), conductive carbon black and carbon fibers (chopped fibers. 6 mm length, 7-8 microns diameter), organic polyamide fibers. 12mm length. 3-5 denier) and mineral filler such as woliastonite. talc and mica have been used in this study, five types of carbon black were studied. Their properties are shown in Table 1 below.<br><br>
All blend ratios described relate to parts by weight, in each case based on 100 parts by weight of the first compound. Typical electrically conductive poiyolefin composites may comprise:  100 parts by weight polymer matrix, 4 to 20 parts by<br>
11<br><br>
Poiyamide. 10 to 55 parts by weight glass fibers. 0.5 to 10 pans by weieht carbon black, 0 to 30 parts by weight carbon fibers.<br>
12<br>
The electrical and mechanical behavior of compositions 10 was studied for different poiyamide mixtures ratios as a runction of giass fiber concentration. polyamide/glass fiber ratio and carbon black concentration. The resistivity and the mechanical properties as a function of composition are summarized in Tables 2A and 2B. It will be appreciated that the samples produced were in accordance with the processing method of the present invention i.e.. injeciion molding.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
14<br>
Tables 3 A and 3B illustrate the dependence; of resistivity and physical properties on glass fiber concentration in compositions 10 for different polypropylene/polyamide mixtures. The increase of tensile sirength, modulus and flexural modulus with increasing glass fiber content is clearly appreciated.<br><br><br><br>
 15<br><br>
16<br>
Tables 3C, 3D and 3E illustrate the dependence of resistivity and physical properties on wollastonite (Table 3C), talc (Table 3D) and mica (Table 3E) and glass fiber concentration in compositions 10 for different, polypropylene.elastomer mixtures.<br><br><br><br>
Table 4 illustrates the dependency of electrical resistivity of PP/PA/GF/CB systems (100/12/30/4 phr ratio respectively) on the type of second thermoplastic component (polyamide) used. It is clearly seen that any type of polyamide can be used for composition 10 and that their electrical conductivity can be determined by selecting the degree of crystalinity of the polyamide. Lower values of resistivity were obtained for<br>
17<br><br>
compositions 10 based on PA 66 and PA 6, PA 11, PA 12 (semicrystalline polyamide) than for those based on PA 6/6-9 and PA 6-12 (amorphous polyamide). Given the same concentration of conductive additive, a higher level of conductivity was achieved in PA 66 (the most crystalline polyamide studied) based compound.<br><br>
It will also be appreciated that any type of carbon black can be used with compositions 10. Resistivity and mechanical properties of composites with five CB grades, at two loading levels , for composites based on Polypropylene (100 parts), PA 66 (12 parts) and glass fibers (30 parts) are presented in Table 5. Inspection of this table reveals that Ketjenblacks EC 300 and EC 600, the most conductive carbon blacks used provide the highest electrical conductivity.<br>
18<br><br><br>
Yet another factor which determines the resistivity and mechanical properties of compositions 10 is the flowability ( MFI) of the polymer matrix used. As clearly seen from Table 6 below, significant lower resistivities are obtained using for example polypropylene with higher MFI. Table 6 is provided below.<br><br>
Table 7 hereinbelow provides examples of compositions 10 including carbon fibers as also illustrated with reference to Figs. 5A - 5C hereinabove. Volume resistivity of less than 1 ohm-cm were achieved in carbon fibers /carbon black/glass fiber/second thermoplastic component (po lyamide)/ polypropylene compounds. Table 7 below illustrates non limiting carbon fibers containing compositions and their properties.<br>
19<br><br><br>
It will be appreciated thai the compositions of the present invention, in particular the ones including carbon fibers and having a resistivity of less than 1 Ohm-cm provide improved Electro Magnetic Interference (EMI) shielding with a lower content of carbon black and carbon fibers. Therefore, they are superior to prior an electrically conductive plastics in a wide range of applications, such as clean room applications where the amount of carbon is important for the cleanliness of the process.<br>
It will be appreciated that the present invention is not limited by what has been described hereinabove and that numerous modifications, all of which fall within the scope of the present invention, exist. For example, while the present invention has been described with reference to polypropylene, the present invention is equally applicable to other polyoleflns such as polyethylene and to polyethylene-polypropylene mixtures. Polyethylene based compositions were prepared using LDPE and HDPE grades in a generally similar manner to that of polypropylene. As an example, a polyethylene based composition (100 parts on a similar weight basis) blended with 11 pans of polyamide (PA6). 20 parts of glass fibers and 4.4 parts of carbon black (EC-300) exhibit volume resistivity of 105 - 106 ohm-cm.<br>
20<br><br>
Table 8 illustrates two further examples of polyethylene based compositions.<br><br>
In other alternative embodiments, the polyolefin component is replaced by another thermoplastic compound as the first component forming matrix 12. In four preferred embodiments, the first component forming matrix 12 was acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene (ABS), polystyrene (PS), high impact polystyrene (HIPS) and polyphenyleneoxide/polystyrene (NORYL). In itwo other embodiments, PBT, PC/ABS and PC are used as the first thermoplastic component.<br>
