				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION	,<br>
The present invention relates to/compositions, inter alia, personal care lotions, laundry detergent compositions, which comprise a photo-labile perfume delivery system capable of releasing fragrance raw material alcohols. The compositions of the present invention can also comprise initial amounts of the releasable fragrance raw material alcohols thereby providing a sustained initial fragrance.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Pro-fragrances and pro-accords have been used to enhance the delivery of fragrance raw materials and to sustain their duration. Typically pro-fragrances and pro-accords deliver alcohol, ketone, aldehyde, and ester fragrance raw materials via substrates which are triggered by one or more release mechanisms, inter alia, the acidic pH of skin, nascent moisture, shift of position of equilibrium.<br>
Fragrances or odors not only provide a pleasant aesthetic benefit, but also serve as a signal. For example, foods, which have soured or are no longer edible, may develop smells, which are repulsive and send a signal that they are no longer palatable. Therefore, the delivery of an aroma sensory signal is also a benefit, which a pro-fragrance can provide.<br>
However, pro-fragrances and pro-accords typically rely on the break down of a chemical species not based on accidental circumstance but on deliberate execution. There are examples of fragrance or odor releasing compounds which involve release of fragrances which are initiated by exposure to electromagnetic radiation, inter alia, UV light, however, these compounds do not have a means for controlling the release rate of the fragrances such that the formulator can ensure the fragrances will be release during a period of time which is of benefit to the consumer. The present invention provides a means for delivering fragrance raw material alcohols wherein the delivery of said alcohols is instigated by exposure to light in a manner which allows the formulator to control the rate of alcohol delivery, and control the impact of the photo-fragment byproducts.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention meets the aforementioned needs in that it has been surprisingly discovered that photo labile compounds can be designed to release fragrance raw materials during a period of time which is useful to the formulator of perfume comprising compositions. One drawback to compounds which release perfumes, photo-labile and otherwise, is the inability to control the release half lives of said compounds. For example, a photo labile pro-fragrance may be capable of releasing a fragrance raw material alcohol, but the release rate is such that the amount of alcohol which is released per unit time is so low that applying a sufficient amount of pro-fragrance necessary to meet aesthetic needs becomes cost prohibited, or is limited by formulation parameters.<br>
It has now been surprisingly discovered that aryl acrylate photo-labile compounds can be modified in a manner which allows for their utility in fragrance delivery systems. These fragrance delivery systems are useful in a wide array of compositions which deliver, in addition to other benefits, an aesthetic benefit.<br>
The first aspect of the present invention relates to photo-labile pro-fragrances having the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein -OR is a unit derived from a fragrance raw material alcohol, HOR; R1 is one or more electron donating groups; each R2 is independently hydrogen, C1-C12 alkyl, C7-C12 alkylenearyl; and mixtures thereof; X is selected from the group consisting of -OH, -NH2, -NHR3, and mixtures thereof; R3 is hydrogen, C1-C12 linear or branched alkyl, C6-C10 aryl, C7-C12 alkylenearyl, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The second aspect of the present invention relates to a fragrance raw material<br>
delivery system comprising:<br>
i)	from about 0.001 % to about 100% by weight, of a photo-labile pro-fragrance<br>
compound having the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R is a unit derived from a fragrance raw material alcohol; R1 is one or<br>
more electron donating groups; each R2 is independently hydrogen, C1-C12 alkyl,<br>
C7-C12 alkylenearyl; and mixtures thereof; X is selected from the group consisting<br>
of -OH, --NHR3. and mixtures thereof; R3 is H, C1-C12 alkyl, C1-C12 alkylenearyl,<br>
and mixtures thereof; and ii)        optionally from about 0.001 % to about 50% by weight, of one or more fragrance<br>
raw materials.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to personal care and laundry and cleaning compositions which comprise the fragrance delivery system of the present invention.<br>
The present invention further relates to an aspect wherein in addition to the release of a fragrance raw material alcohol, the photo-labile trigger which is released can also itself be a fragrance raw material ingredient.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention relates to methods for providing an enhanced duration or modified release fragrance.<br>
These and other objects, features, and advantages will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from a reading of the following detailed description and the appended claims. All percentages, ratios and proportions herein are by weight,<br>
unless otherwise specified. All temperatures are in degrees Celsius (° C) unless otherwise specified. All documents cited are in relevant part, incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the surprising discovery that aryl acrylate pro-fragrances having the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
which are capable of releasing a fragrance raw material alcohol ROH, can be modified to have release half-lives which are useful to formulators and/or photo-fragment byproducts which are useful to formulators.<br>
The surprising discovery relates to the fact that R1 units which are electron-donating groups, modulate the rate at which the photo-labile fragrance raw material is released. Without wishing to be limited by theory, the R1 unit is capable of modulating the first photo-isomerization step and/or the second fragrance raw material elimination step.<br>
The formulator can choose between combinations of R1 and/or R2 units to achieve the desired modulated release rate.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the term "electron donating group" is defined herein as "functional groups which will tend to donate the electrons which comprise said groups toward another functional unit or bond, inter alia, aromatic rings, said donation of electrons referenced with respect to the propensity of a hydrogen atom to donate its electrons."  Donating groups according to the present invention are -O" (de-protonated hydroxy), -N(R3)2, -NHR3, -NH2, -OH, -OR3, -NHC(O)R3, -NR3C(O)R3, -OC(O)R3, -R3, -CH=CCR3)2, wherein R3 is hydrogen, C1-C12 linear or branched alkyl, C6-C10 aryl, C7-C12 alkylenearyl, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The first aspect of electron donating groups as it relates to the present invention comprise units defined herein as "strongly donating units" which are units selected from the group consisting of-O- (de-protonated hydroxy), -N(R3)2, -NHR3, -NH2, -OH, and -OR3 wherein R3 is C1-C4 alkyl.<br>
The second aspect of electron donating groups as it relates to the present invention comprise units defined herein as "moderately/weakly donating units" which are units selected from the group consisting of -NHC(O)R3, -NR3C(O)R3, -OC(O)R3, -R3, -CH=C(R3)2, wherein R3 is a C1-C12 linear or branched alkyl, phenyl, or benzyl.<br>
However, for the purposes of the present invention, as indicated herein below, a strongly donating unit and a moderately/weakly donating unit may be contained in the same molecule.<br>
The present invention also relates to the discovery that aryl acrylate pro-fragrances having the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
which are capable of releasing a fragrance raw material alcohol ROH and the photo-fragment by-product having the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
can be modified such that the photo-fragment by-product is a substituted coumarin derivative having an odor impact level especially useful to the formulators when combined with from about 0.001% to about 50% by weight of one or more fragrance raw materials. The discovery relates to the fact that R1 units which are electron donating groups, as defined herein above, modulate the odor detection threshold level of the photo-fragment by-product that is released prior to or concomitant to the release of the photo-labile fragrance raw material.<br>
Each R2 is independently hydrogen, C1-C12 alkyl, C7-C,2 alkylenearyl; and mixtures thereof. One embodiment of the present invention comprises each R2 unit as a hydrogen, whereas other embodiments include alkyl, inter alia, methyl, and alkylenearyl, inter alia, benzyl.<br>
Another embodiment relates to aryl acrylate pro-fragrances where the R1 and R2 units are chosen such that the coumarin derivative released from the aryl acrylate pro-fragrance has an odor detection threshold that is 2 times greater than the odor detection threshold for the corresponding coumarin derivative released from the aryl acrylate pro-fragrance where the R1 and R2 units are all chosen to be hydrogen.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention X is -OH, -NH2, or-NHR3; whereas X1 is the ring closed form of X, namely, -O-, -NH-, and -NR3- respectively.<br>
Without wishing to be limited by theory, the reaction cascade which releases the fragrance raw material alcohol of the present invention is believed to proceed as follows: 1.        A first photo-isomerization step:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
second fragrance raw material elimination step:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
OR wherein R represents the released fragrance raw material alcohol.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention relates to R1 units which are hydroxy. One example of a pro-fragrance wherein X is hydroxy, an R1 unit is also hydroxy, and both R2 units are hydrogen relates to 3-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-acrylate fragrance raw material esters having the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
However, other embodiments include pro-fragrances having an R1 hydroxy moiety in a ring position other than the 4-position, or to a pro-fragrance having multiple R1 hydroxy units, for example, a pro-fragrance having the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
A further embodiment relates to R1 units having the formula -OR3 wherein R3 is C1-C12 linear or branched alkyl or phenyl, for example, a pro-fragrance having the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
pro-fragrance having the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
or a pro-fragrance having the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
A further embodiment of the present invention relates to aryl rings substituted with one or more C1-C12 acyloxy units having the formula R3CO2-, for example, a pro-fragrance having the formula:<br>
A further embodiment relates to R1 units which are -N(R3)2 units wherein R3 is hydrogen, C1-C12 linear or branched alkyl, or mixtures thereof, for example, a pro-fragrance having the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
X units relate to aspects of the photo-labile pro-fragrances. A first aspect relates to X units which are -OH and which result in the formation of derivatives of coumarin as reaction by-products. A second aspect wherein X is -NHR3 relates to the formation of derivatives of 2-hydroxyquinoline as reaction by-products. An example of a pro-fragrance wherein X is -NH2, the R1 unit is hydroxy, and both R2 units are hydrogen relates to 3-(2-amino-4-hydroxyphenyl)-acrylate fragrance raw material esters having the<br>
formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In both aspects of X, R2 units can be units other than hydrogen, for example C1-alkyl. One example of an embodiment wherein R2 units are non-hydrogen is a pro-fragrance wherein X is hydroxy, each R1 unit is hydrogen, one R2 unit is methyl and the second R2 unit is hydrogen is 3-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-3-methyl-acrylate fragrance raw material esters having the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
A further embodiment of the X equal to hydroxy aspect relates an R1 units which is hydroxy and at least one R2 unit which is alkyi Fore example, 3-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-methyl-acrylate having the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
A third aspect of the present invention relates to the selection of R1, R2 and X units such that the rate of ROM fragrance raw material release is increased. One embodiment of this increased release selection relates to pro-fragrances releasing an ROH at a rate at least 1.5 times the rate of an analog having each R1 and both R2 units equal to hydrogen, also defined herein for X equal to hydroxy and amino as the "baseline" or "reference" analogs. Another aspect relates to a selection of moieties such that the rate of fragrance alcohol release is at least twice that rate of release by the corresponding baseline analog.   A further embodiment increases the rate at least 3 times faster that the corresponding baseline analog.<br>
R units are radicals derived from fragrance raw material alcohols. For the purposes of the present invention the term "fragrance raw material alcohol" is defined herein as "any alcohol having a molecular weight of 100 g/mole or greater.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention fragrance raw material alcohols are grouped into classes, for example, alcohols which comprise nearly the same structure will have comparable release rates with the same electron donating R1. A non-limiting example of these similar alcohols include geraniol and nerol which are isomers.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention the following are defined herein as fragrance raw materials alcohols derived from a terpene: geraniol, nerol, eugenol, isoeugenol, citronellol, menthol, isopulegol, terpineol, borneol, isobomeol, linalool, tetrahydrolinalool, myrcenol, dihydromyrcenol, muguol, farnesol and mixtures thereof. However, the formulator will realize these are not the only terpene raw material alcohols but are those which comprise one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Non-limiting examples of R units derived from a non-terpene alcohol include those selected from the group consisting of cinnamyl alcohol, methylcinnamyl alcohol, Majantol, Hydrotropic alcohol, nopol. Lavandulol, carvenol, cuminyl alcohol, thymol, and mixtures thereof.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the following are defined herein as "blossom alcohols": 4-(1-methylethyl)cyclo-hexanemethanol, 2,4-dimethyl-3-cyclohexen-1-ylmethanol, 2,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ylmethanol, 2,4,6-trimethyl-3-cyclohexen-1-ylmethanol, 2-phenylethanol, 1-(4-isopropylcyclohexyl)ethanol, 2-(o-methylphenyl)ethanol, 2-(m-methylphenyl)ethanol, 2-(p-methylphenyl)-ethanol, 2,2-dimethyl-3-(3-methylphenyl)propan-1 -ol, 3-phenyl-2-propen-1-oL, 2-methy1-4-(2,2,3-trimethyl-3-cyclopenten-1-yl)-2-buten-1ol, 3-methyl-5-phenylpentan-1-ol, 3-methyl-5-(2,2,3-trimethyl-3-cyclopenten-1-yl)-4-penten-2-ol, 2-methyl-4-phenylpentan-1-ol, c/s-3-hexen-1-ol, 3,7-dimethyl-6-octen-1-ol, 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadien-1-ol, 7-methoxy-3,7-dimethyloctan-2-ol, 6,8-dimethylnonan-2-ol, cIs-6-nonen-1-ol, 2,6-nonadien-1-ol, 4-rnethyl-3-decen-5-ol, benzyl alcohol, 2-methoxy-4-(1-propenyl)phenol, 2-methoxy-4-(2-propenyl)phenol, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Fragrance raw material alcohols suitable for use in the present invention are described in U.S. 5,919,752 Morelli etal., issued July 6, 1999; U.S. 6,013,618 Morelli et al., issued January 11, 2000; U.S. 6,077,821 Morelli et al., issued June 20, 2000; U.S. 6,087,322 Morelli et al.. issued July 11, 2000; U.S. 6,114,302 Morelli et al.. issued September 5, 2000; U.S. 6,177,389 Morelli et al., issued January 23, 2001; all of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The present invention further relates to an aspect wherein in addition to the release of a fragrance raw material alcohol, the photo-labile trigger which is released can<br>
also itself be a fragrance raw material ingredient. For example, the material released by the X equals oxygen aspect (coumarin derivatives) may itself be a fine fragrance component, fragrance law material, or perfume adjunct ingredient. The same is equally true for the X equals nitrogen aspect (2-hydroxyquinoline derivatives).<br>
Or in another embodiment, the coumarin derivative which is release may provide a different benefit, for example, once the ring closure reaction is complete, the resulting compound may have sufficient conjugation to be a colored material, and therefore serve as a visual signal.<br>
The following relates to methods for preparing the photo-labile pro-fragrances of the present invention.<br>
A first procedure relates to the conversion of a starting material having formula 1 to the aryl acrylate photo-labile pro-fragrance 3 by way of the intermediate aryl acrylic acid 2 as depicted in the following scheme:<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
In the case wherein X is equal to oxygen (coumarin derivatives) the preparation begins with a von Peohmann condensation as in the example of the reaction of recorcinol with acetoacetic acid ethyl ester depicted in the following scheme:<br>
