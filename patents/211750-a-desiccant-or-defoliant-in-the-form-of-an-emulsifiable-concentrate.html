				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a composition for regulating plant growth and a method for applying the same.<br>
Related Art<br>
The 3-substituted phenylpyrazole derivative represented by the general formula {1} shown hereinafter which is used in the present invention is a compound described in Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication Nos. 3-163063 and 4-211065.  As a foliage applied herbicide, said derivative has an excellent herbicidal activity against all of herbaceous weeds which are harmful to upland farming.  Particularly when applied for wheat (barley, oats or rye) cropping, said derivative exhibits a marked herbicidal effect on typical weeds such as cleavers (Galium aparinel, chickweed tStellaria media), birdseye speedwell (Veronica persica), sentless chamomile (Matricaria inodora), purple deadnettle (Lamium purpureuml, henbit (Lamium amplexicaule), shepherd"s purse tcapsella bursa-postoris), marsh yellowcress (Rorippa islandica), sticky chickweed (Cerastium viscosum), common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album), tufted knotweed (Polygomum lonqisetum),<br><br>
prostrate knotweed (Polygonum avicularel, etc.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
There is desired the development of a novel plant growth regulator {e.g. desiccant or defoliant) used for facilitating harvesting of root vegetables<br>
(e.g. potato), fiber crops (e.g. cotton), oil crops<br>
(e.g. soybean and sunflower) and cereals (e.g. rice). The present inventors earnestly investigated for developing a novel composition for regulating plant growth, and consequently found that a 3-substituted pyrazole derivative, a compound well known as a herbicide is useful for preparing a composition for regulating plant growth, such as a desiccant or defoliant for root vegetables (e.g. potato), fiber crops<br>
(e.g. cotton), oil crops {e.g. soybean and sunflower) and cereals (e.g. rice), whereby the present invention has been accomplished.<br>
