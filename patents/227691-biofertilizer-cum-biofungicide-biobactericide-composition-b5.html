				<td>The invention &quot;Biofertilizer cum biofungicide / biobactericide composition B5&quot; prepared by us on account of our inventive steps is completely new. The composition B5 prepared from a bacterium namely B. subtilis strain B5 has the ability to provide plant growth promotion and control of soil/ seed borne pathogens of potato, vegetables and ornamental crop plants. It releases an antibiotic metabolite which is fungicidal, bactericidal, supports immune system, biosynthesizes siderophores, tRNA binder, stimulatory, and decreases toxicity. Apart from fungicidal and bactericidal metabolite, the other metabolite produced is a flavonoid, which is capable of removing dead cells, acts as a detoxifying agent, keeps cells healthy, increases metabolism and supports immunity. It has a killing effect against pathogenic species of Fusarium, Pythium ,Phytophthora Rhizoctonia, Sclerotium and Alternaria in the form of cell lysis or antibiosis. Inhibits R. solanacearum, the cause of bacterial wilt of potato against which no chemical or a resistant variety is effective till date, by antibiosis, competitive inhibition and siderophore production. The effects of mechanisms involved to the reduction of diseases and the enhancement of crop yield reveal the fact that all the effects of interactions namely, cell lysis, antibiosis, competition and disease escape, are most obvious in case of attacks by siol- borne pathogens because they are able to operate in the rhizosphere area of the plant. The composition B5 is prepared in an inexpensive substrate which allows maximum production of viable cells in shortest time with a shelf life of one year at room temperatures (15-37°C) and gives best results when applied on seed or into soil, safe for persons handling it and non target pathogens with no side effects on biodiversity.</td>

				<td>4.  DESCRIPTION:<br>
Field of invention<br>
This invention relates to a composition, which has ability to provide plant growth enhancement and control of soil/seed-borne pathogens of potato, vegetables and ornamental crop plants.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Plant associated microorganisms have been studied for their role in natural and induced suppressiveness of soil borne diseases. Among the many groups of such type of organisms are root associated bacteria or rhizobacteria which have the ability upon re-introduction to seed or vegetative plant parts to colonize the developing root system in the presence of other competing soil inhabiting microorganisms. Because competing soil bacteria and introduced rhizobacteria form natural microflora of a healthy plant so they are considered to be important factors to plant growth enhancement, suppressiveness and crop resistance against soil borne and foliar diseases. Recently some introduced rhizobacteria have been found to increase plant defences, leading to systemic protection against soil/seed borne and foliar pathogens upon seed or root inoculations with rhiziobacteria. In such cases, introduction of the rhizobacteria results in reduced damage to multiple pathogens and this concept of using bacteria for control of plant diseases generally involves the application of increased specific bacterial strain as biological control agent (bca) which causes disease suppressiveness by increasing populations of the existing bca in root environment or by altering the community of rhizosphere micro-organisms (see, for example Kloepper et al (1987) Nature, 285 : 885-86; Pusey, P.L. and Hotchkiss, M.W. (1988) Plant Disease, 72 (7): 622-25; Kloepper et al (1999) Australian Plant Pathology, 28: 21-26 Gautam, M; Dureja, P. and Sen, B. (2000) Indian J. Experimental Biology, 38 : 84-87; Press, CM. and Kloepper, J.W. (2001) Phytopathology, 91 (6); 593-98)<br>
The present attempt of using introduced root associated bacteria for control for bacterial wilt and seed/soil borne diseases of potato and other crop plants has lead to the discovery of the present invention i.e., a bca B5 which is plant growth promoting and has both fungicidal and bactericidal properties.<br>
Objective of the invention<br>
The invention was initially aimed to find out a potential bca which can control bacterial wilt/brown rot disease of potato for which no resistant variety or chemical control measure is known till date. Apart from this, aim was also to find out efficacy of this bca for controlling soil/seed borne diseases of crop plants other than potato.<br>
Last objective was to develop a composition of bca B5 in an inexpensive substrate which allowed maximum production of viable cells and had a long shelf life at room temperatures (15-37°C) and nontoxic to plants<br>
The Invention<br>
The present invention provides a composition having bio-fertilizer ,bio-fungicide and bio-bactericide activity, comprising 2.0 g of Bacillus subtilis strain B5 and 98.0 gm of powder mixture of bantonite and carboxyl methyl cellulose per 100 g packing.A method for preparing a composition as claimed in claim 1, comprising the steps of mixing 2.0 g of Bacillus subtilis strain B5 and 98.0 gm of power mixture of bantonite and carboxyl methyl cellulose per 100 g packing.<br>
In accordance with the first objective of the invention, a bacterial bca which could control bacterial wilt of potato was selected and identified as Bacillus subtilis strain B5 by specialists at International Mycological Institute (IMI), UK with IMI No. 360643 in the year 1994 (copy enclosed). This bca was isolated from rhizosphere soil of potato plants growing in bacterial wilt infested field soil at Bhowali, Uttranchal (then in Uttar Pradesh), India. The bca B5 is effective in managing diseases in major crops like potato, vegetables and ornamental crop plants. Apart from this, the bca B5 under in vitro tests, revealed killing effect against pathogenic species of Fusarium, Pythium, Phytophthora, Rhizoctonia, Sclerotium and Alternaria in the form of cell lysis or antibiosis (Sheet Nos. 1-3) and by competitive inhibition and siderophore production against R.solanacearum, the cause of bacterial wilt of potato for which no chemical control/resistant variety is available till date (Sheet No. 4).<br>
In accordance with the last objective, a "bio-fertilizer cum bio-fungicide/ bio-bactericide composition B5" that retained high bacterial viability at room temperatures (15-37°C) for a period of one year has been developed in 100 g packing. For every lOOg packet of dried composition, 2.0 g of 48 hour old biomass of bca B5 was mixed in 98.0 g of presterilized powder mixture containing 96.0 g of bentonite powder and 2.0 g of carboxy methyl cellulose. After mixing, each packet was sealed aseptically. Each sealed packets contains bca BS populations of 1010 colony forming units (cfu)/g of composition which was confirmed by method of counting viable bacterial cells by the formula: Populations/g = No. of colonies/per plate x I/amount of suspension x 10 x dilution factor.<br><br><br>
Field trials and additional character<br>
After consistent good performance of bca B5 in house and research fields from 1993-98, disease control and fertilizer economy experiments were conducted in twelve ecologically different states of the country to evaluate the performance of this composition. The results revealed enhancement in potato yields ranging between 7 to little about 100% (Table 1: Sheet No. 5).<br>
Table 1; Fertilizer economy by the use of composition BS<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
* Values are average of 3 years data This table illustrates the effectiveness of composition B5 in enhancing potato yields at 12 research centers working under AICPIP of CPRI, Shimla.<br>
Results of large scale use of this composition in the fields of farmers, Army farms and flower growers in western Uttar Pradesh and Nanital district of Uttaranchal convinced the farmers to replace chemical pesticide with this composition so as to reduce/eliminate their extensive use for controlling seed and soil borne diseases and enhancing yields of potato, vegetable and ornamental crop plants (Tables 2 &amp; 3)<br><br>
Table 2: Multilocation effect of composition BS to control bacterial wilt disease of potato<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
* Values are average of 3 year data.<br>
The results reveal impact of this composition in managing bacterial wilt of potato at<br>
ecologically different research centers working under AICPIP, CPRI Shimla.<br>
Table 3: Efficacy of composition BS against Fusarium and Rhizoctonia species affecting potato and gladiolus.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
The results clearly reveal the impact caused by composition B5 in eliminating diseases of Fusarium and Rhizoctonia species in respect of potato and gladeoli ornamentals.<br><br><br>
Industrial applicability<br>
Considering the cost, shelf life, viability, proliferation and establishment in the introduced environment, a composition "bio-fertilizer cum bio-fungicide/ bio-bactericide composition B5" has been evolved and prepared in inexpensive substrate which allows maximum production of viable cells in shortest time. It is easy in application and has given consistent results in enhancing crop yields and controlling diseases when tested at 12 ecologically different states of India. This product gives best results when applied on seeds or into soils and has a shelf life of one year at room temperature (15-37°C) and is safe for persons handling it.<br>
The composition having bio-fertilizer, bio-fungicide and bio-bactericide activity, is not a mere admixture, The effect shown by the claimed composition is more than the added effects of the ingredients of the composition.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
