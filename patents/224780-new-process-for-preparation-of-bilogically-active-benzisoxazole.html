				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of<br>
biologically active risperidone (I) i.e. 3-[2-[4-(6-fluoro-1,2-benzisoxazol-3-yl)-<br>
piperidin-1-yl]ethyl]-2-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one<br>
and also a new polymorphic variety of this compound.<br>
2. DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Schizophrenia is one of the most severe and debilitating major psychiatric<br>
diseases. The introduction of antipsychotic drugs was indisputably a great<br>
advance in the pharmacotherapy of mental disorders. The typical antipsychotic<br>
drugs are not effective in all patients. Patients with chronic schizophrenia are<br>
either unresponsive or only partially responsive to their antipsychotic drugs. In<br>
addition, antipsychotics are ineffective against other dimensions of schizophrenic<br>
pathology, namely the negative symptoms of the deficit state and neurocognitive<br>
deficits. Lastly, typical antipsychotic drugs have an extensive side-effect profile,<br>
with the majority of patients experiencing one or more of the acute<br>
extrapyramidal syndromes and patients in an unenviable position in which they<br>
can expect only some symptoms to respond to treatment, along with<br>
uncomfortable and possibly disabling side-effects.<br>
Risperidone ( I ) i.e. 3-[2-[4-(6-fluoro-1,2-benzisoxazol-3-yl)-piperidin-1-<br>
yl]ethyl]-2-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one has been<br>
introduced in the wake of clozapine induced toxicity. Risperidone, a benzisoxazol<br>
derivative, is an antipsychotic agent, which combines potent serotonin 5HT2 and<br>
dopamine D2 receptor antagonism. Another advantage offered by risperidone is<br>
a faster onset of antipsychotic action, a lower incidence of extrapyramidal effects<br>
and possibly greater efficacy against the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.<br>
The cardiovascular effects of risperidone reflect its a-adrenergic antagonistic<br>
activity, comprising a dose-related decrease in blood pressure and reflex<br>
tachycardia on single, but not multiple dose administration. Patients with<br>
schizophrenia appear to be more tolerant of the hypotensive effect of risperidone<br>
than healthy volunteers. (Drug 1992; Journal of Chromatography, 1993).<br>
Risperidone (I) i.e. 3-[2-[4-(6-fluoro-1,2-benzisoxazol-3-yl) -piperidin-1-yl]<br>
ethyl]-2-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-4H-pyrido [1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one can be<br>
prepared by the various processes.<br>
According to the process disclosed in ES 2074966, 3-(2-chloroethyl)-<br>
6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-2-methyl-4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidine-4-one, compound (II) is<br>
converted into dibenzyl amine derivative. The dibenzyl group is removed and<br>
converted into primary amine i.e. compound (III). On the other hand<br>
diflourobenzyl ketone i.e. compound (IV) is converted into its oxime by oximation.<br>
The oxime was further cyclized to give benzisoxazol ring. Upon the sequence of<br>
the reaction, pyran ring (6 membered oxygen containing ring) is opened to have<br>
iodo group on one arm and hydroxy group on the other arm as shown in<br>
compound (V). Hydroxy group is then converted into good leaving group for<br>
example mesylate group to give compound (VI). The condensation reaction of<br>
compound (VI) and compound (III), using sodium bicarbonate in acetonitrile<br>
under reflux condition gave risperidone. The above reaction Scheme-I is shown<br>
below:<br>
The process of Scheme-I involves multiple process steps such as<br>
conversion of chloro-compound (II) into its dibenzyl-protected amine followed by<br>
conversion to primary amine (III). It requires highly expensive catalytic<br>
reduction procedure, wherein costlier palladium on carbon is used as catalyst.<br>
Also, the overall yield of the reaction sequence is poor.<br>
Further, the ratio of "syn : anti" in the intermediate oxime is around 3:1,<br>
from which the unrequired anti form, which is 25 % w/w, is required to be<br>
removed by column chromatography.<br>
It may be appreciated that the said drug which is in high demand requires<br>
production in high volumes to meet the same. Hence, for production of the active<br>
pharmaceutical ingredient (API) i.e. bulk drug in higher quantities, the seperation<br>
of anti isomer by column chromatography is highly time consuming, resource<br>
oriented in terms of the cost of the eluents, silica gel etc. besides the inherent<br>
disadvantage of the laborious column chromatographic separation process at the<br>
production level.<br>
For conversion of hydroxy group to good leaving group i.e. mesylate,<br>
mesityl chloride is used in this synthetic route. The use of fuming, corrosive,<br>
lacrymetric mesityl chloride needs to be avoided as it is hazardous and not easy<br>
to handle. The solvent used in the scheme (I), is acetonitrile, which again is a<br>
harmful solvent to human and has limitations based on regulatory requirements.<br>
In the hydrogenation process the reagent used is Pd / C, which is flammable.<br>
in WO 01/085731, 3-(2-chloroethyl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-2-methyl-4H-<br>
pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidine-4-one, which is obtained by reduction of 3-(2-<br>
chloroethyl)-2-methyl-4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidine-4-one, is treated with<br>
benzisoxazol derivative (VII) i.e. 6-fluoro-3-(4-piperidinyl)-1,2-benzisoxazole to<br>
give risperidone (I) as shown in Scheme II. However, in this sequence the<br>
reduction is carried out in acidic medium . To carry out the reduction, it would<br>
require pressure vessel with special grade of material of construction having<br>
higher capacity in order to carry out the reaction at production scale, which will<br>
in-turn involve higher capital investment.<br>
X is a good leaving group halogen and preferably chlorine.<br>
It need to be noted that according to the European pharmacopoea the<br>
purity requirement is minimum 99.7%, whereas purity of the bulk drug prepared<br>
according to Scheme II of WO 01/85731 is 99% . In addition, it uses Dimethyl<br>
formamide (DMF) for purification at the extreme last step. Dimethyl formamide is<br>
harmful to human and very difficult solvent to remove from bulk drug. As DMF is<br>
diificult to remove, organic volatile impurities (OVI) limit for DMF set by the<br>
regulatory requirement is difficult to achieve in the bulk API.<br>
In ES 2050069, 3-(2-chloroethyl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-2-methyl-4H-<br>
pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidine-4-one, is treated with (2,4-difluorophenyl)-(4-<br>
piperidinyl)methanone in the presence of acetonitrile, NaHCO3 and Kl as shown<br>
in Scheme III wherein L represents chlorine. The condensation product is then<br>
converted into oxime followed by cyclization into risperidone. This process,<br>
which follows a linear route, gives less yield as the oxime formation and<br>
cyclization to form benzisoxazol, is carried out separately, after the<br>
condensation reaction.<br>
Acetonitrile, used in this scheme, is costlier and harmful solvent to human<br>
and has limitations based on regulatory requirement with respect to organic<br>
volatile impurities. Also, it entails effluent disposal/treatment problems.<br>
The reaction steps mentioned in EP- 196132 as shown in scheme IV for<br>
production of risperidone result in poor yield.<br>
Also, Teva (WO 02/12200 and WO 02/14286), have disclosed preparation<br>
of risperidone according to Scheme IV shown above and have recommended<br>
the solvent as acetonitrile, in the last step. Acetonitrile, as mentioned earlier, is<br>
costlier and is the harmful solvent to human and has limitations based on<br>
regulatory requirement with respect to organic volatile impurities. Also, it entails<br>
effluent disposal / treatment problems.<br>
Though, there are more than one procedure for preparation of risperidone<br>
by various routes as discussed above, there are more than one underlying<br>
problems associated with each of the processes. These problems have not been<br>
so far handled completely. Hence, there is a long felt need to develop a new<br>
process to take care of the mentioned problems.<br>
Thus, there is a demand for a cost-effective process for synthesizing<br>
risperidone on commercial scale with higher yields, while reducing number of<br>
process steps and avoiding harmful solvents, which are subject to stringent<br>
control by regulatory authorities. The need was felt for a method using simple<br>
raw materials which are non-hazardous, non-fuming and easy-to-handle on a<br>
commercial scale. The process also need to dispense with the use of harmful<br>
reagents such as mesityl chloride to make it more eco-friendly. Further, method<br>
has to be simple i.e. without involving laborious separation steps by column<br>
chromatography.<br>
It is an aim of the present invention to solve the problems associated with<br>
the prior art and to provide a simple, efficient and cost effective method for<br>
production of risperidone. According to one aspect of the present invention,<br>
there is provided an efficient process for the preparation of risperidone, which<br>
provides obvious benefits with respect to economics, generation of minimal<br>
effluents, lesser number of process steps, less reactor occupancy, higher purity<br>
of the product with convenience to operate on a commercial scale<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The first object of the invention is to provide an improved, cost-effective<br>
process for synthesis of the risperidone in high yield.<br>
The second object of the invention is to provide a process for synthesis of<br>
risperidone that avoids harmful solvents used hitherto in its synthesis.<br>
The third object of the invention to provide for a process for purification of<br>
risperidone with a minimal amount of organic volatile impurities (OVI) in the<br>
purified product.<br>

risperidone for use as active ingredient in a tablet formulation.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a new polymorphic variety<br>

diffraction and IR data.<br>
The present invention accordingly provides for a process for the<br>
production of risperidone of formula (I),<br>
which comprises the steps of :<br>

(e) optionally purifying risperidone obtained in step (d) by using one or more<br>
solvents.<br>

Risperidone form T1 as obtained according to one embodiment of the instant<br>
invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides an improved process for preparing the<br>
biologically active benzisoxazole, risperidone (I) as discussed herein :-<br>
The compound (VIII) which is a HCI salt of compound (II), is prepared<br>
according to a procedure known in the art.<br>
The oximation of compound (IX) gives the syn-and-anti isorners (X) and<br>
(XI) respectively of the oxime, according to the procedure known in the art.<br>
The chloro compound (VIM) obtained in Reaction A is finally reacted with<br>
the mixture of oximes in the presence of a solvent and a base to give a target<br>
compound risperidone (I).<br>
The condensation and cyclization of the condensed product is carried out<br>
simultaneously in Reaction C thereby helping to reduce the reactor occupancy<br>
(time cycle for the manufacturing process) and thus reducing the overhead and<br>
increasing the productivity. The procedure according to the instant invention<br>
does not require isolation of the condensed product or the oxime and the final<br>
risperidone is obtained directly without chromatographic seperation in a very high<br>
yield and purities as required under the pharmacopeal standard.<br>
The reaction also avoids the use of lacrymatric reagents such as mesityl<br>

The purity of risperidone produced by the process of the instant invention<br>
is more than 99% which satisfies the regulatory requirement of the bulk drug.<br>
If the purity of the risperidone is not satisfactory, it can be further purified<br>

to the higher boiling point of butyl acetate the recovery of the solvent is effective<br>
and efficient.<br>
The formation of various polymorphs are dependent upon choice of<br>

xylene (s), Dymethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N-methyl pyrrolidone, N, N-<br>
dimethylacetamide, nitrobenzene, ketones, chlorohydrocarbon, linear acyclic<br>
ethers or mixtures thereof.<br>
The solvent for obtaining the polymorhic form A comprises of propyl<br>
acetate and higher homologous esters.<br>
One of the ester solvents for obtaining the polymorphic form A is butyl<br>
acetate. Choice of butyl acetate as solvent is preferred because reduced<br>
volume of the required solvent which in turn governs reactor size, utilities<br>
associated with it and also the reaction time . Further due to the higher boiling<br>
point the recovery of the solvent is effective and efficient.<br>
The purification process can also be carried out by using the mixture of<br>
isopropyl alcohol and dimethylformamide in the ratio of 99:1 to 1:99. Preferred<br>
mixture is isopropyl alcohol and dimethylformamide in the ratio of 60:40 to 99:1.<br>
The most preferred mixture is isopropyl alcohol and dimethylformamide in the<br>
ratio of 95:5. As can be seen from the experimental data with higher % of<br>
dimethylformamide, the traces of Organic Volatile Impurities (OVI) in the form of<br>
dimethylformamide remains even after the purification and drying of the product.<br>
The purification can as well lead to the desired polymorph, including Form A.<br>
The present invention further provides for a new polymorphic form of<br>
risperidone namely, form T1 obtained by isolation of this polymorphic variety<br>
through purification of crude risperidone obtained by the process of this invention<br>
with use of isopropyl alcohol and dimethyl formamide in the ratio 95:5 as<br>
purification solvent. Risperidone form T1 is characterized by XRD pattern as<br>
given in Fig-1 of the accompanying drawings.<br>
Risperidone Form T1 is characterized by the following physiochemical<br>
data:<br>

(3.1537), 28.867 (3.0904), 32.888 (2.7212) ± 0.2 degrees two-theta.<br>
In the following section preferred embodiments are described by way of<br>
examples to illustrate the process of this invention. However, this is not intended<br>
in any way to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
PREPARATORY EXAMPLE<br>
PREPARATION OF RISPERIDONE<br>
Example 1<br>
In one liter four neck round bottom flask 250 ml of isopropyl alcohol was<br>
taken at room temperature i.e. 20 to 35 °C. To the reaction flask, 25 gm of (2,4-<br>
difluorophenyl)(4-piperidinyl) methanone oxime was added followed by addition<br>
of 30 gm of 3-(2-chloroethyl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-2-methyl-4H-pyrido[1,2-<br>
a]pyrimidin-4-one hydrochloride and 75 gm of sodium Carbonate. To it 3.75 gm<br>
of Potassium Iodide was added. Reaction mixture was stirred for 5-10 minutes.<br>
The reaction mixture was slowly heated to reflux (80-82°C), and the temperature<br>
maintained for next 4 hours. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room<br>
temperature (20 -35 °C).<br>
Potassium hydroxide solution (30 gm KOH in 60 ml water) was prepared<br>
separately and cooled to 15°C. Potassium hydroxide solution was added slowly<br>
to the reaction mixture and stirred at 30-40°C for 6 hours. The reaction mixture is<br>
quenched slowly by addition of the reaction mixture in a 5 lit. 4-neck round<br>
bottom flask containing 2 lit. water at room temperature (20 -35 DC). The mixture<br>
stirred at room temperature (20 -35 °C) for 1 hour and 30 minutes. The product<br>
filtered and washed with 500 ml of water till neutral pH to get 43 gm of wet<br>
resperidone, which was further dried at 65 °C for 6hours to get 32.0 gm of dry<br>

The Examples 7 A to 7G given above will indicate that the level of organic volatile<br>
impurities (OVI) can be reduced by reducing the preparation of DMF in the<br>
solvent mix as tabulated below :<br>
Example 8<br>
Obtaining the particle size<br>
After drying, material obtained by the process of Example 7A to 7G can be<br>
passed through gyratory sifter having mesh no. 40. Thereafter, it is subjected to<br>
Air-jet Milling Machine. The material is again passed through gyratory sifter of<br>
mesh no. 100. Finally, the material is blended in a blender and it is further taken<br>
up for preparation of pharmaceutical dosage form, wherein the particle size of<br>
above mentioned specification are obtained.<br>
Risperidone is low dosage drug i.e. the dose is 0.5mg or 1mg or 2mg or<br>
3mg or 4mg or 5mg or 6mg. For low dosage drugs, it is advisable to have better<br>
distribution of particles, which also further controls the dose uniformity. The<br>
distribution of particles depends upon number of particles in the pharmaceutical<br>
dosage form. The number of particles, in turn, is dependent upon particle size<br>
distribution because for the given dosage form, if the particle size is higher, there<br>
would be only less number of particles in the pharmaceutical composition.<br>
Thus, the innovator i.e. Janssen have recommended the following particle size<br>
for the pharmaceutical composition (Risperdal: Review of Chemistry,<br>
Manufacturing, and Controls (Freedom of Information, FOI), dated 8th March,<br>
1994, Department of Health and Human Services, Food &amp; Drug Administration<br>
(FDA), NDA 20-272, USFDA).<br>
To achieve finer particle size as recommended, it needs more equipment,<br>
usage of special milling instrument such as fluid energy mill etc, along with<br>
associated utilities and manpower. To obtain particle size of these narrow limits,<br>
repetition of milling is occasionally demanded and also there is loss of the active<br>
pharmaceutical ingredient (API) due to the various process steps associated with<br>
this, including sifting. Sifting of API generally gives rise to escaping of the finer<br>
particles in to air, with potential inhalation hazard.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found by the inventor of the instant invention, that<br>
the particle size given in the following Table IV, which is having coarse particle<br>
size, is also sufficient to comply the necessary requirement to prepare the<br>
effective pharmaceutical dosage form towards patient use. The particle size<br>
according to the instant invention as given in Table IV is higher compared to the<br>
particle size recommended by Janssen as mentioned in Table III. Thus, this<br>
aspect of the instant invention is beneficial with respect to equipment usage,<br>
utilities, manpower, the need of special milling equipment can avoid loss of API<br>
and help to reduce inhalation hazard etc.<br>
For the determination of the formulation prepared from the instant<br>
invention, the study was taken up wherein, a randomized 1 period, 1 treatment, 1<br>
way parallel, pilot bioavailability study of two brands of risperidone 1)<br>
Risperidone (test; formulation according to the instant invention) tablet of 1 mg<br>
and 2) Rispedal (reference; formulation (from market) of Janssen<br>
Pharmaceuticals) tablet of 1 mg was administered as 1x 1 mg in healthy<br>
volenteers, under fasting conditions. The result is as given in Table V as under:<br>
Observation : The pharmacokinetic parameters i.e Cmax, tmax and AUC(0-inf) of<br>
test volunteer as well as reference volunteer fall within the therapeutic range as<br>
mentioned in the literature ( May-Lynn Huang et.al.; Clinical Pharmacology &amp;<br>
Therapeutics, Sept. 1993) shown in the Table VI.<br>
Inspite of the higher particle size of the API for the formulation of the<br>
instant invention, formulation is found to be comparable with the innovator's<br>
formulation (from the market ), which is for therapeutic use for mammals. As<br>
shown in the table the formulation of the instant invention is acceptable as<br>
pharmaceuticle dosage form for mammals.<br>
Using Risperidone obtained from the above referred process the final<br>
dosage form is prepared from the ingredients comprising of Risperidone, lactose,<br>
microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium sterate, water and other excipient known<br>
to the person skilled in the art followed by coating of the same.<br>
While the present invention has been described in terms of its specific<br>
embodiments, certain modifications and equivalents will be apparent to these<br>
skilled in the art and are intended to be included within the scope of the present<br>
