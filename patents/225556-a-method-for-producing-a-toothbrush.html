Method for producing a toothbrush<br>
The invention relates to a method for producing a<br>
_*&gt;	.	<br>
toothbrush in accordance with the preamble of claim 1.<br>
WO-A-94/05183 discloses a method for producing a toothbrush consisting of two different material components, in which method, in a first step, the main body of the toothbrush is injected from a first material component, for which purpose a first cavity is provided. Thereafter, in a second cavity, a further material component, for example an elastic and/or nonslip material, is injected onto various parts of the main body. The main body has a relatively narrow cross section both in its area supporting the bristles and also in its handle area.<br>
In order to improve the grip of toothbrushes and to permit comfortable handling, it is advantageous to make the toothbrush relatively solid in its handle area, i.e. to give the handle a relatively large cross section. However, this kind of handle design entails a number of disadvantages from the point of view of production- technology. Not only is more material used as a result of the greater volume of the handle; the injection time and cooling time are also hugely increased by the greater mass, and the injection-molding process is thus prolonged (longer molding time). In addition, such handle parts with a relatively large cross section have a tendency to cavitation (i.e. formation of air bubbles) which are visible in handles made of a transparent material and detract from the esthetic effect of the toothbrush.<br>
The object of the present invention is to propose a method of the type mentioned at the outset which guarantees short injection intervals when producing a toothbrush with a solid handle of large cross section.<br><br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by a method with the features of claim 1.<br>
The invention is explained in greater detail below with reference to the drawing.<br>
Three variants of the method according to the invention are illustrated in the drawing and are described in greater detail below.<br>
In the drawing, which is purely diagrammatic:<br>
Figs 1 to 3   show a first method variant in three<br>
steps;<br>
Fig. 4        shows in a side view, and partially in<br>
cross  section,  a  toothbrush produced according to the method steps in Figs 1<br>
to 3;<br>
Fig, 5        shows  a  plan  view  of  part  of  an<br>
injection mold  for  the  first  method variant;<br>
Figs 6 and 7   show a second method variant  in two<br>
steps;<br>
Fig. 8        shows in a side view, and partially in<br>
)	cross  section,  a  toothbrush produced<br>
according to the method steps in Figs 6 and 7;<br>
Fig. 9        shows  a  plan  view  of  part  of  an<br>
5	injection mold for the second method<br>
variant; and<br>
Fig. 10       shows  a  plan  view  of  part  of  an<br>
injection  mold  for  a  third  method<br><br>
variant.<br>
to produce a toothbrush 1 which is shown in Fig. 4 and<br>
rhose handle 2 has a larger cross section than the<br>
:ront head part 3 provided for securing the bristles or<br>
:uf ts,  an inner part 4 of the handle 2  is first<br>
prepared in a first step shown in Fig. 1. For this<br>
purpose,  a  first  portion  of  the  first  material<br>
component provided for the handle 2 (and if appropriate<br>
also for the head part 3) is injected into a first<br>
cavity 8 formed between two parts 5, 6 of an injection<br>
nold 7.  The  first  injection point  for  the  first<br>
material component delivered from a first unit Al is<br>
indicated by API in Fig. 1, while the injection channel<br>
or injection nozzle provided for this is indicated by<br>
9.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 5', the inj ection mold 7 is provided for the production of a plurality of toothbrushes 1, if appropriate eight tooth brushes 1. After partial cooling and hardening (as soon as sufficient inherent stability is achieved), the inner parts 4 injected in the first step according to Fig. 1 are transferred in each case into a second cavity 12, shown in Fig. 2, using a generally known transfer system (not shown in the drawing) , for example a so-called internal handling system arranged on the injection-molding tool, an external rotary or linear handling system, or robots. This first transfer is indicated symbolically with an arrow Ul in Fig. 5.<br>
The inner part 4 can have support knobs (not shown in Figure 1) which protrude in the radial direction and by means of which the inner part 4 is supported on the wall of the second cavity 12, in order to be held centrally there.<br>
In a second step shown in Fig. 2, a second portion, if appropriate  the  remaining  portion,  of  the  first<br><br>
material component is m]eccea into tne second cavity 12 via an injection channel or an injection nozzle 13. The second injection point AP2 for the first plastic component is offset in relation to the first injection gate API, viewed in the longitudinal direction of the toothbrush to be produced. The second portion of the first material component comes into direct contact with the first portion; in the illustrative embodiment shown, material is injected around the inner part 4, the handle 2 acquires the desired solid shape in its rear area, and the front head part 3 of narrower cross section is also obtained. Thus, a main body of the toothbrush 1 is formed which consists of the first material component and is indicated by 10 in Figures 2 and 5. To inject both portions of the first material component, only one unit Al is preferably used, as is indicated in Figures 1 and 2. However, the two portions of the same material could also be injected from two different units and could for example have different colors.<br>
In the method variant according to Figures 1 to 5, in a third step, a further material component, for example a material which is more elastically resilient compared to the first material component, e.g. a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE), is finally injected around the front area of the handle 2. For this purpose, the main body 10 consisting of the first material component is transferred into a third cavity 16 of the injection mold 7 after the second portion has cooled and hardened, in which case once again the second transfer of all eight main bodies 10, indicated by the arrow U2 in Fig. 5, is effected by means of a suction tool (not shown).<br>
According to Fig. 3, the second material component is injected into the third cavity 16 from a further unit A2 via an injection channel or injection nozzle 17 at a third injection point AP3,  material being injected<br><br>
around a front part 2a (Figures 2 and 3) of the handle 2 and a kind of coating thus being formed over part of the length of the handle. Such a grip part 20 can contribute, for example, to a further improvement in the gripping of the toothbrush 1. It is of course possible to add further material components into further cavities.<br>
Figures 6, 7 and 9 show a further method variant for producing a toothbrush 1' which is shown in Fig. 8 and which once again has a front head part 3 and a handle 2 of greater cross section compared to the latter. In a first step in this variant, according to Figure 6, the head part 3, a front part 2a of the handle 2, and a part 2b of the rear part of the handle with increased cross section, are injection-molded from a first material component and together form a main body 3 0 of the toothbrush 1' . The first cavity provided for this purpose and formed between two parts 25, 26 of an injection mold 27 is indicated by 28 in Fig. 6. This first cavity 28 is designed in such a way that the part 2b of the handle 2 has an upper injection surface 24 extending at an inclination relative to the longitudinal direction of the toothbrush 1' to be produced; the injection surface 24 could of course extend in another direction. At an injection point API, a first portion of the first material component from a first unit Al is injected into the first cavity 28 via an injection channel or injection nozzle 29. As can be seen from Fig. 9, a number of main bodies 30, possibly eight main bodies, are once again produced in one injection mold 27 and, after partial cooling and hardening, are transferred into a second cavity 32 shown in Fig. 2 by means of a transfer system (not shown) . This transfer is indicated with an arrow Ul in Fig. 9.<br>
In a second step shown in Fig. 7, the second, remaining portion of the first material component is injected via<br><br>
an injection channel or an injection nozzle 33, preferably from the same unit Al as the first portion, into the second cavity 32 at a rear, second injection point AP2 which lies behind the injection surface 24 of the main body 30 located in the cavity 32. Here too, however, an additional unit could be made available for the second portion. The remaining part 2c (Fig. 7) of the handle 2 is formed by the second portion of the first material component injected onto the injection surface 24 of the cooled handle part 2b. In this variant, the main body 3 0 is designed in such a way that the space in the second cavity 32 provided for injecting this second portion (or for forming the remaining handle part 2c) is separated from a space of the second cavity 32 provided for the injection of a second second material component surrounding the front handle part 2a, this separation being effected by a peripheral surface 34 of the inserted main body 3 0 which is located at the transition between the front part 2a and the part 2b of the handle 2 provided with the injection surface 24. Thus, simultaneous with the injection of the second, remaining portion of the first material component, it is also possible to inject the second material component, specifically from another unit A2, at a third injection point AP3, via an injection channel (or injection nozzle) 3 7 opening into the second cavity 32. Here too, in order to improve its grip, the handle 2 is provided with the grip part 20 consisting, for example, of an elastically more resilient material component. If necessary, the injection of the first and second material component could take place sequentially.<br>
Accordingly, in the second method variant according to Figures 6, 7 and 9 (in contrast to the first variant according to Figures 1 to 3 and Figure 5) , only two cavities 28, 32 are needed for each toothbrush 1', and only one transfer Ul is required.<br><br>
Both in the first method variant and in the second method variant, by dividing the injection-molding of the handle 2 of thickened cross section into two operating steps, i.e. by injection-molding the same material in two portions, the injection time and the cooling time are substantially reduced, i.e. shorter injection intervals are permitted, and in addition the formation of cavities is avoided. The last-mentioned advantage is of particular importance in transparent or translucent handles. The separating lines, or in the case of transparent material the separating surfaces, between the handle parts injected in the individual portions are barely visible. Of course, these handle parts (and the cavities required fpr them) could have a different form than that represented and described in the illustrative embodiments according to Figures 1 to 5 and Figures 6 to 9. It would also be entirely possible for the handle of thickened cross section to be injected in more than two portions, and to provide an additional cavity for each further portion.<br>
The production of a two-component toothbrush 1, 1' has been described with reference to Figures 1 to 5 and Figures 6 to 9, respectively. A one-component toothbrush, i.e. a toothbrush consisting of a single material component, could of course also be injection-molded in two or more portions according to the invention.<br>
A two-component toothbrush could also be of a quite different configuration than that shown in Fig. 4 or 8. For example, the head part 3 could be made from another material component than the handle 2. In t&amp;is case, the material component provided for producing the handle 2 of greater thickness than the head part 3 could advantageously be injected in two portions of approximately the same size.<br>
In a multi-component toothbrush, however, a number of<br><br>
material components can according to the invention also be divided into two or more portions which are injected sequentially. For each component which is divided up, an additional cavity per portion is of course required.<br>
A further method variant for producing a toothbrush, if appropriate once again a two-component toothbrush 1', is indicated in Fig. 10. In a first step, a main body 40 of this toothbrush 1' ' , which has a head part 3 and a handle 2 of larger cross section, is produced by injecting a first material component into a first cavity 41 of an injection mold 42, the first material component being completely injected into the first cavity 41 in this variant. Accordingly, as soon as sufficient inherent stability is achieved after partial cooling and hardening, the main body 40 is transferred into a cooling cavity 43 by means of a suction tool (not shown), which transfer is indicated with an arrow Ul in Fig. 10. In the cooling cavity 43, which is not provided with any injection point or injection channel, further cooling and hardening of the main body 40, in particular of its solid handle 2, takes place until there is no risk of deformation when, in a further step, the main body 40 is transferred into a further cavity 44 (see arrow U2 in Fig. 10) into which a second and for example more resiliently elastic material component is injected in order to form the grip part 20. This variant too permits short injection intervals by means of the transfer Ul of the main body 40 into the cooling cavity 43.<br>
Fig. 10 again shows by way of example an injection mold 42 provided for the simultaneous production of 8 toothbrushes. Of course, in all the variants, other mold sizes having another number of cavities (e.g. with 16 or 24 cavities per operating step) are conceivable.<br>
A wide variety of plastics can be used as suitable material  components,  and  these  can  be  at  least<br><br>
partially transparent materials, for example styrene-acrylonitrile, polyester, polystyrene, polyamides, polycarbonates,   polymethylmethacrylate   or   others.<br>
Examples of opaque materials that can be used are<br>
-*i	<br>
polypropylene,	thermoplastic	elastomers	or<br>
polyethylene.<br><br><br>
