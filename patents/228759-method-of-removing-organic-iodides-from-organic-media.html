				<td>METHOD OF REMOVING ORGANIC IODIDES FROM ORGANIC MEDIA<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates generally to the removal of iodides from organic media and more<br>
particularly to the removal of higher iodides, such as dodecyl iodide from acetic acid and/or<br>
acetic anhydride manufactured by utilizing a rhodium-iodide catalyst system.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Perhaps the most widely used process for :he manufacture of acetic acid, the well known<br>
Monsanto process, involves carbonylating methanol in the presence of rhodium, methyl iodide,<br>
methyl acetate and water. The product is suitable for all purposes; however, iodide<br>
contamination is an issue with respect to acetic acid made by way of the Monsanto process or in<br>
acetic anhydride manufactured by way of a rhodium-iodide catalyst system.<br>
It was discovered by Hilton that macroreticulated, strong acid cationic exchange resins with at<br>
least one percent of their active sites conve rted to the silver or mercury form exhibited<br>
remarkable removal efficiency for iodide contaminants in acetic acid or other organic media.<br>
The amount of silver or mercury associated with the resin may be from as low as about one<br>
percent to as high as 100 percent. Preferably about 25 percent to about 75 percent of the active<br>
sites were converted to the silver or mercury form and most preferably about 50 percent. There<br>
is disclosed in United States Patent No. 4,615,806 removal of various iodides from acetic acid.<br>
In particular there is shown in the examples removal of methyl iodide, HI, I2 and hexyl iodide.<br>
Various embodiments of the basic invention disclosed in United States Patent No. 4,615,806<br>
have subsequently appeared in the literature. There is shown in United States Patent No.<br>
5,139,981 to Kurland a method for removing iodides from liquid carboxylic acid contaminated<br>
with a halide impurity by contacting the liquid halide contaminant acid with a silver (I)<br>
exchanged macroreticular resin. The halide reacts with the resin bound silver and is removed<br>
from the carboxylic acid stream. The invention in the '981 patent more particularly relates to an<br>
improved method for producing the silver exchanged macroreticular resins suitable for use in<br>
iodide removal from acetic acid.<br>
United States Patent No. 5,227,524 to Jones discloses a process for removing iodides using a<br>
particular silver-exchanged macroreticular strong acid ion exchange resin. The resin has from<br>
about 4 to about 12 percent cross-linking, a surface area in the proton exchanged form of less<br>
than 10 m2/g after drying from the water wet state and a surface area of greater than 10m2/g<br>
after drying from a wet state in which the water has been replaced by methanol. The resin has at<br>
least one percent of its active sites converted to the silver form and preferably from about 30 to<br>
about 70 percent of its active sites converted to the silver form.<br><br>
United States Patent No. 5,801,279 to Miura et al. discloses a method of operating a silver<br>
exchanged macroreticular strong acid ion exchange resin bed for removing iodides from a<br>
Monsanto type acetic acid stream. The operating method involves operating the bed while<br>
elevating the temperatures in stages and contacting the acetic acid and/or acetic anhydride<br>
containing the iodide compounds with the resins. Exemplified in the patent is the removal of<br>
hexyl iodide from acetic acid at temperatures of from about 25째 C to about 45째 C.<br>
So also, other ion exchange resins have been used to remove iodide impurities from acetic acid<br>
and/or acetic anhydride. There is disclosed in United States Patent No.5,220,058 to Fish et al.<br>
the use of ion exchange resins having metal exchanged thiol functional groups for removing<br>
iodide impurities from acetic acid and/or acetic anhydride. Typically, the thiol functionality of<br>
the ion exchange resin has been exchanged with silver, palladium, or mercury.<br>
There is further disclosed in European Publication No. 0 685 445 Al a process for removing<br>
iodide compounds from acetic acid. The process involves contacting an iodide containing acetic<br>
acid stream with a polyvinylpyridine at elevated temperatures to remove the iodides. Typically,<br>
the acetic acid was fed to the resin bed according to the '445 publication at a temperature of<br>
about100째C.<br>
With ever increasing cost pressures and higher energy prices, there has been ever increasing<br>
motivation to simplify chemical manufacturing operations and particularly to reduce the number<br>
of manufacturing steps. In this regard, it is noted that in United States Patent No. 5,416,237 to<br>
Aubigne et al. there is disclosed a single zone distillation process for making acetic acid. Such<br>
process modifications, while desirable in terms of energy costs, tend to place increasing<br>
demands on the purification train. In particular, fewer recycles and fewer purification steps tend<br>
to introduce (or fail to remove) a higher level of iodides into the product stream and particularly<br>
more iodides of a higher molecular weight. For example, octyl iodide, decyl iodide and dodeycl<br>
iodides may all be present in the product stream as well as hexadecyl iodide.<br>
The prior art resin beds operated as described above do not efficiently and quantitatively remove<br>
higher organic iodides from organic media such as acetic acid or acetic acid streams as required<br>
by certain end uses, particularly the manufacture of vinyl acetate monomer. Accordingly, an<br>
object of the present invention is to provide for the efficient and nearly quantitative removal of<br>
higher organic iodides from an acetic acid and/or acetic anhydride product stream.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
There is provided in a first aspect of the present invention, a method of removing organic iodides<br>
from non-aqueous organic media comprising contacting the organic media with a silver or<br><br>
mercury exchanged cationic ion exchange substrate at a temperature greater than about 50 째C.<br>
Generally the organic media contains rganic iodides with an aliphatic chain length of C10 or<br>
greater. In many embodiments the organic media contains organic iodides at least about 25 <br>
percent by weight of which have an aliphatic chain length of C10 or greater. In still other <br>
embodiments at least about 50 percent of the organic iodides include organic iodides having <br>
chain length of C10 or greater. Such iodides may be selected from the group consisting of <br>
iodide and dodecyl iodide. Preferably the treatment of the organic media is effective to remove<br>
at least about 90 percent by weight of the decyl iodides and dodecyl iodides from the organic<br>
media. Organic media in some embodiments contains total iodides in the range of from about 10<br>
ppb to about 1000 ppb. More typically the organic media contains from about 250 ppb total<br>
iodide to about 750 ppb total iodide. Treatment of the organic media in accordance with the<br>
present invention preferably removes at least about 99 percent of the total iodides from the<br>
organic media.<br>
There is provided in accordance with another aspect of the present invention a method of<br>
removing iodides from acetic acid or acetic anhydride including the steps of: (1) providing a<br>
stream of acetic acid or acetic anhydride with an organic iodide content wherein at least about 20<br>
percent of said organic iodides comprise C10 or higher molecular weight organic iodides; (2)<br>
contacting said stream with a macroreticular, strong acid, ion exchange resin wherein at least<br>
about one percent of the active sites of the resin have been converted to the silver or mercury<br>
form. The bed is operated at a temperature (that is, the resin is maintained at a temperature) of at<br>
least about 50째 C and is operative to remove at least about 90 percent of the organic iodides in<br>
the stream of acetic acid or acetic anhydride. Most typically, the method is practiced on an acetic<br>
acid stream. Typical temperatures may include temperatures of at least about 60째 C, at least<br>
about 70째 C or at least about 80째 C depending upon the flow rates and the nature of the iodides<br>
sought to be removed. The upper limit may be about 100째 C or up to 150째C provided the resin<br>
selected is stable at these temperatures.<br>
Most typically the resin is a sulfonic acid functionalized resin, wherein from about 25 to about<br>
75 percent of the active sites have been converted to the silver form, whereas the product stream,<br>
prior to contacting the resin, has an iodide content of greater than about 100 ppb organic iodide.<br>
After contacting the resin, the stream, which initially had greater than 100 ppb organic iodide,<br>
typically has less than 20 ppb iodide and more desirably has less than about 10 ppb organic<br>
iodide.<br>
In some embodiments the stream may, prior to contacting said resin, have an organic iodide<br>
content of greater than about 200 ppb. In such instances the ion exchange resin is operative to<br>
reduce the organic iodide content of the stream to less than about 20 ppb and desirably to less<br><br>
than about 10 ppb. Most preferably the ion exchange resin employed is a silver exchanged,<br>
strong acid styrene/divinyl benzene sulfonated resin wherein from about 1 to about 95 percent of<br>
the functional sites have been converted to the silver form.<br>
Generally, the process of the present invention is effective to remove at least about 95 percent of<br>
the organic iodides in the product stream.<br>
As used herein, unless otherwise indicated, ppb means parts per billion by weight of the mixture,<br>
ppm indicates parts per million by weight of the mixture, and percent, "%" indicates weight<br>
percent of the mixture or weight percent of the component as the context indicates.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The method of the present invention is suitable for removing iodide compounds from non-<br>
aqueous organic media. Such media may be organic acids, organic acid anhydrides, alcohols,<br>
ethers, esters, and the like. Media of particular importance include acetic acid and acetic<br>
anhydride by the term "non-aqueous" it is simply meant that water is not present to any<br>
significant extent, not typically present in an amount significantly past its solubility in the<br>
organic medium being processed. Generally, not present by more than 1%, and typically not<br><br>
present by more than 0.5% even in the case of organic media which are highly miscible with<br>
water.<br>
The total amount of iodide present in the organic medium will vary depending upon the specific<br>
nature of the organic medium. Generally total iodide will not exceed 1000 parts per billion (ppb)<br>
when processed in accordance with the present invention, but will typically fall within the range<br>
from about 5 to about 500 ppb.<br>
The invention is particularly useful for removing high molecular weight organic iodide<br>
compounds from acetic acid as may be encountered in a Monsanto type carbonylation process<br>
wherein it is desired to minimize the components utilized in the purification train as disclosed,<br>
for example, in United States Patent No. 5,416,237 to Aubigne et al., the disclosure of which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in its entirety. Without a heavy ends treatment<br>
column or optional finishing distillation column, the removal of higher molecular weight iodides<br>
from the product stream is necessary in order to meet product specifications for iodide,<br>
especially for iodide-sensitive end uses such as the manufacture of vinyl acetate monomer as<br>
will be appreciated by one of skill in the art.<br>
Ion exchange resins or other suitable substrates are typically prepared for use in connection with<br>
the present invention by exchanging any where from about 1 to about 99 percent of the active<br>
sites of the resin to the silver or mercury form by contacting the resin with a silver or mercury<br>
salt, as is taught for example in United States Patent Nos.: 4,615,806; 5,139,981; 5,227,524 the<br>
disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Suitably stable ion exchange resins utilized in connection with the present invention typically are<br>
of the "RSO3H" type classified as "strong acid", that is, sulfonic acid, cation exchange resins of<br>
the macroreticular (macroporous) type. Particularly suitable ion exchange substrates include<br>
Amberlyst짰 15 resin (Rohm and Haas), being particularly suitable for use at elevated<br>
temperatures. Other stable ion exchange substrates such as zeolites may be employed, provided<br>
that the material is stable in the organic medium at the conditions of interest, that is, will not<br>
chemically decompose or release silver or mercury into the organic medium in unacceptable<br>
amounts. Zeolite cationic ion exchange substrates are disclosed for example, in United States<br>
Patent No. 5,962,735 to Kulprathipanja et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
At temperatures greater than about 50째C, the silver or mercury exchanged cationic substrate may<br>
tend to release only small amounts of si ver on the order of 500 ppb or less and thus the silver or<br>
mercury exchanged substrate is chemically stable under the conditions of interest. More<br><br>
preferably silver losses are less than about 100 ppb into the organic medium and still more<br>
preferably less than about 20 ppb into the organic medium. Silver losses may be slightly higher<br>
upon start up or if the process is conducte d such that it may be exposed to light, since silver<br>
iodide is believed photoreactive and may form soluble complexes if contacted by light. In any<br>
event, if so desired, a bed of cationic material in the unexchanged form may be placed<br>
downstream of the silver or mercury exchange material of the present invention.<br>
The process of the present invention may be carried out in any suitable configuration. A<br>
particularly preferred configuration is to utilize a bed of particulate material (termed herein a<br>
"guard bed") inasmuch as this configura;ion is particularly convenient. A typical flow rate, such<br>
as is used when acetic acid is to be purified, is from about 0.5 to about 20 bed volumes per hour<br>
(BV/hr). A bed volume of organic medium is simply a volume of the medium equal to the<br>
volume occupied by the resin bed. A flow rate of 1 BV/hr then means that a quantity of organic<br>
liquid equal to the volume occupied by the resin bed passes through the resin bed in a one hour<br>
time period. Preferred flow rates are usually from about 6 to about 10 BV/hr whereas a<br>
preferred flow rate is frequently about 6 BV/hr.<br>
The invention is better understood by reference to the following examples.<br>
Examples<br>
The following examples used the procedures described below. Iodide removal was performed<br>
using silver exchanged Amberlyst짰 15 resin. The resin (100 ml wet) was loaded into a 22 mm<br>
OD glass column and acetic acid containing iodides was eluted at a flow rate of 13.3 ml/min.<br>
Iodide levels in the eluate were measured every two (2) hours. Total iodides are measured in the<br>
eluate by any suitable technique. One suitable technique is by way of neutron activation<br>
analysis (NAA) as is well known in the art. The iodide levels for particular species were also<br>
measured. A preferred method in this latter respect is gas chromatography utilizing an electron<br>
capture detector.<br>
Comparative Examples A and B<br>
Samples of the residue from the drying column of a conventional Monsanto type acetic acid<br>
plant containing 540 ppb total iodide and 238 ppb total iodide were treated at room temperature<br>
using a silver exchanged bed of Amberlyst짰 15 (CZ-B) resin and the total iodides in the eluate<br>
were measured as a function of time as shown in Figure 1. As can be seen from Figure 1, total<br>
iodide removal was typically less than about 90% and progressively decayed over a ten hour<br>
time period to much lower removal efficiencies.<br><br>
The various iodide components in the feed were identified to include:<br>
methyl iodide<br>
ethyl iodide<br>
2-iodo-2-methyl propane<br>
propyl iodide<br>
2-butyl iodide<br>
butyl iodide<br>
iodine<br>
pentyl iodide<br>
hexyl iodide<br>
octyl iodide<br>
decyl iodide<br>
dodecyl iodide<br>
hexadecyl iodide<br>
The predominant high molecular weight organic iodide components identified were decyl iodide<br>
and dodecyl iodide.<br>
Comparative Examples of C and D and Example 1<br>
Following the procedure outlined above, the temperature dependence of the guard bed<br>
performance was measured for relatively high (ppm) levels of organic iodides in acetic acid.<br>
Results for dodecyl iodide and hexyl iodide at 25째C and 100째C are shown in Figure 2. Results<br>
indicate that guard bed performance is greatly enhanced at 100째C over 25째C, for dodecyl iodide.<br>
Performance improvements include both removal efficiency and useful life of the bed.<br>
Comparative Examples E,F<br>
Following the procedure outlined above, the effect of chain branching on guard bed performance<br>
was investigated by comparing removal of hexyl iodide with removal of neopentyl iodide.<br>
Results appear in Figure 3.<br>
Examples 2-4 and Comparative Examples G and H<br>
Following the procedure outlined above, performance of a silver-exchanged Amberlyst짰 15<br>
guard bed was evaluated for removal of dodecyl iodide at 25째C, 50째C, 75째C, and 100째C and for<br>
removal of hexyl iodide at 25째C. Results appear in Figure 4. Here again, it can be seen removal<br>
efficiencies and useful capacities of the bed are greatly enhanced at temperatures above about<br>
50째C.<br><br>
Example 5 and Comparative Examples J and K<br>
Following the procedures outlined above, samples of acetic acid (drying column residue) from a<br>
Monsanto type of acetic acid plant were obtained containing respectively 540 ppb total iodide,<br>
238 ppb total iodide and 259 ppb total iodide. The acid was treated, as before, using a silver<br>
exchanged Amberlyst짰15 guard bed at 25째C and 50째C. Results appear in Figure 5. As can be<br>
seen from Figure 5, performance at 50째C was far superior to removal efficiencies at 25째C.<br>
Indeed the guard bed removed greater than 99% (nearly quantitative removal) of the total iodide<br>
at 50째C.<br>
While the invention has been described in detail and exemplified, various modifications will be<br>
readily apparent to those of skill in the art For example, one may utilize an ion exchange resin<br>
suited for higher temperatures in connect on with the present invention. Such modifications are<br>
