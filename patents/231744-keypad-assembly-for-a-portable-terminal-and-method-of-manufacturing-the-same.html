				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a keypad assembly for use with a terminal,<br>
and more particularly to a keypad assembly for use with a terminal, which includes<br>
lighting elements, and a method for the same.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Generally, a keypad assembly of a conventional portable terminal, including<br>
without limitation portable, wireless communication terminals, comprises a keypad<br>
and a switch substrate. The keypad includes a plate-shaped elastic layer and a<br>
plurality of key buttons. The plurality of key buttons is formed on a first surface of<br>
the elastic layer. In the keypad, letter, numbers and characters, etc., are respectively<br>
printed on a surface of each key button. The switch substrate has a plurality of<br>
switches integrated therewith to provide electric contact as each key button is pushed.<br>
The switch substrate converts a depression of a respective key button into an electric<br>
signal.<br>
The portable terminal has lighting elements enabling a user to use the<br>
keypad in the dark. A plurality of light emitting diodes and inorganic electro<br>
luminescence are used as the lighting elements. The light emitting diodes are<br>
generally arranged on a printed circuit board, while the inorganic electro<br>
luminescence is inserted in an elastic pad.<br>
FIG. 1 is a sectional view of a conventional keypad assembly 100 including a<br>
plurality of light emitting diodes. Referring to FIG. 1. the conventional keypad<br>
assembly 100 includes a switch substrate 120, a plurality of diodes 122 and a keypad<br>
110.<br>
The keypad 110 includes a plate-shaped elastic layer 111, a plurality of kebuttons 112, and a plurality of protrusions 111a formed on a second surface of the<br>
elastic layer 111 opposite to the first surface. Characters and the like are printed on<br>
a first surface of each key button 112. Each key button 112 and the corresponding<br>
protrusion 111a are aligned vertically.<br><br>
The switch substrate 120 includes a plate type printed circuit board 120a and<br>
a plurality of switches 121. The plurality of switches 121 is formed on an upper<br>
surface of the printed circuit board 120a while being opposed to the keypad 110.<br>
Each switch 121 includes a conductive contact member and a conductive dome fully<br>
covering the contact member. The light emitting diodes 122 are mounted on the<br>
upper surface of the printed circuit board 120a.<br>
In order to ensure operation of the switch 121, each light emitting diode 122<br>
is preferably prevented from being located in vertical alignment with a<br>
corresponding key button 112. That is, the light emitting diodes 122 are respectively<br>
placed between the switches 121, so as to emit the light to the respective key buttons<br>
112 at an oblique angle. This in turn causes the light to unevenly reach each key<br>
button 112. Therefore, the respective key buttons may be shaded in darkness.<br>
In order to solve the above-mentioned problem, some conventional keypad<br>
assemblies have been proposed which includes a keypad having an elastic layer and<br>
inorganic electro luminescence inserted in the elastic layer. However, a separate<br>
AC electric source is necessary in order to use the inorganic electro luminescence.<br>
That is, such a keypad assembly requires an inverter for converting DC to AC As a<br>
result, the volume and manufacturing cost of the keypad assembly increases. In<br>
addition, DC to AC conversion generates noise in the portable terminal.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention has been made to reduce or overcome the<br>
above-mentioned problems occurring in the prior art and provides additional<br>
advantages, by providing a keypad assembly for a use with a terminal (e.g. a portable<br>
terminal), which includes a waveguide capable of illuminating keys with uniform<br>
brightness.<br>
According to a first embodiment of the present invention, a keypad assembly<br>
includes a keypad having at least one elastic layer and at least one key button on the<br>
elastic layer, a waveguide for transmitting and guiding light therethrough, the<br>
waveguide being placed below the elastic layer and having at least one reflection<br>
pattern to reflect light toward a respective key button, and a switch substrate under<br><br>
the waveguide and having at least one switch corresponding to the respective kebutton.<br>

exemplary embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 3 is an enlarged sectional<br><br>
view of a part of the keypad assembly 200 shown in FIG. 2. FIG. 4 is a top view of<br>
an exemplary waveguide 220 arranged on a switch substrate 230 of the keypad<br>
assembly 200 shown in FIG. 2.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 2 to 4, the keypad assembly 200 according to an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes a keypad 210. the<br>
waveguide 220. the switch substrate 230 placed below a second surface 222 of the<br>
waveguide 220 to have at least one switch 231a and 233, and at least one light<br>
source 241 and 242.<br>
The keypad 210 includes an elastic layer 211 and at least one key button 212<br>
formed on the elastic layer 211.<br>
The elastic layer 211 according to an exemplary embodiment of the present<br>
invention has a plate shape, which has at least one key button 212 and pressing<br>
protrusions 211a formed on both surfaces thereof to be vertically aligned. The key<br>
buttons 212 may be formed on an upper surface of the elastic layer 211. The<br>
pressing protrusions 211a may be formed on a lower surface of the elastic layer 211<br>
to face a first surface 221 of the waveguide 220. The elastic layer 210 is made of<br>
material having excellent elasticity, such as synthetic resin and silicone.<br>
Consequently, the key button 212 returns to an initial state after a user activates the<br>
key button 212.<br>
Characters, numbers, etc. may be printed on an upper surface of each of the<br>
key buttons 212. The key buttons 212 are made of the same material as or a<br>
different material from the elastic layer and integrated with the elastic layer 211.<br>
Meanwhile, the key buttons 212 may be made of material such as polycarbonate and<br>
acryl based resin, which in turn is attached to the elastic layer 211. The key buttons<br>
212 can have any shape including shapes of a circle, oval, square and the like, if<br>
necessary. Separate elastic layers/films can be inserted between the key buttons 212<br>
and the elastic layer 211, and polyurethane film can be used for the separate films.<br>
The plurality of the pressing protrusions 211a according to an exemplar}<br>
embodiment of the present invention may be formed on a lower surface opposite to<br>
the upper surface of the elastic layer 211 on which the key buttons are formed. The<br>
pressing protrusions 211a are integrally formed with the elastic layer 211.<br>
Alternatively, they may be separately formed before being attached to the elastic<br><br>
layer 211 by adhesive.<br>
The waveguide 220 may have the first surface 221 facing the lower surface of<br>
the elastic layer 211 and the second surface 222. The second surface 222 may<br>
include reflection patterns 222a, to reflect light toward the above direction,<br>
corresponding key button 212, at portions corresponding to the key buttons 212<br>
respectively. Further, a side of the waveguide 220 may be coupled to or may<br>
include light sources 241 and 242 and tend to transmit and guide light from the light<br>
source 241 and 242 within the waveguide 220, except at the intended exposure<br>
points (e.g.. at the key buttons 212). The waveguide 220 may include the light<br>
guide plate or optical fiber array. The light guide plate may be made of any optically<br>
transparent material using any of the well-known materials and techniques known to<br>
those skilled in the art. The exemplary examples of these materials are silicone,<br>
polycarbonate or acryl based resin. The exemplary examples of the well-known<br>
molding techniques are injection or press molding process. The optical fiber array<br>
may be manufactured by arranging a plurality of optical fibers.<br>
The light guide plate may have a convex shape at points where the switches<br>
233 are disposed, as shown in Fig. 2. Alternatively, the light guide plate can be flat<br>
or substantially flat without having noticeably convex points or any other shape, as<br>
long as it serves its role as the light guide.<br>
The reflection patterns 222a may be formed at portions on the second surface<br>
222 of the waveguide 220 to face each pressing protrusion 211a according to an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The reflection patterns 222a may<br>
diffusively reflect a part of the light transmitting in the waveguide 220. This results<br>
in illuminating the key buttons 212.<br>
The reflection pattern 222a may be formed by a method of scratching or<br>
printing them on the second surface 222 of the waveguide 220. The density of the<br>
reflection pattern 222a may be set differently at different locations to uniformly<br>
illuminate the key buttons 212.<br>
Light sources 241 and 242 according to an exemplary embodiment of the<br>
present invention may be attached to a side of the switch substrate 230. The light<br>
sources 241 and 242 are mounted on the switch substrate 230 so that light emitting<br>
surfaces of the light sources 241 and 242 are opposite to the side of the waveguide<br><br>
220. The light emitted from the light sources 241 and 242 is transmitted through<br>
the side of the waveguide 220 in the waveguide 220. Light emitting diodes can be<br>
generally used as the light sources 241 and 242.<br>
The exemplary waveguide 220 shown in FIG. 4 includes a first optical fiber<br>
array 220a straightly arranged at a center portion of the waveguide 220 and a second<br>
optical fiber array 220b surrounding the first optical fiber array 220a. The first<br>
optical fiber array 220a is divided at an end thereof into two parts. The two parts of<br>
the first optical fiber array 220a are connected to the light sources 241 and 242.<br>
respectively. The second optical fiber array 220b has both ends connected to the<br>
light sources 241 and 242, respectively.<br>
The switch substrate 230 may have a plurality of supporting protrusions 250<br>
formed on the upper surface thereof so as to guide the waveguide 220 to safely<br>
occupy a seat on an upper surface of switch substrate 230. The supporting protrusion<br>
250 can be removed after assembling an optical fiber array on the switch substrate<br>
230. By using the supporting protrusions 250, the waveguide 220 may be positioned<br>
right on the substrate 230 or may be suspended over the substrate 230. The switch<br>
substrate 230 may include a printed circuit board 232 and a dome sheet 231.<br>
The printed circuit board 232 according to an exemplary embodiment of the<br>
present invention has a plurality of conductive contact members 233 formed on an<br>
upper surface thereof. A contact member 233 and corresponding dome 231a may<br>
construct each of switches 233 and 231a. Further, each switch 233 and 231a is<br>
vertically aligned with the corresponding pressing protrusion 211a. The printed<br>
circuit board 232 may include a flexible printed circuit board.<br>
The dome sheet 231 is disposed on the upper surface of the printed circuit<br>
board 232, which includes a plurality of conductive domes 231a having a<br>
hemispheric shape. The respective domes 231a fully cover the corresponding contact<br>
member 233.<br>
When a user pushes any key 212, the corresponding pressing protrusion 211a<br>
of the elastic layer 211 positioned below the key 212 presses the waveguide 220 and<br>
the corresponding dome 231a. The pressed dome 231a forms an electric contact,<br>
along with the corresponding contact member 233.<br>
