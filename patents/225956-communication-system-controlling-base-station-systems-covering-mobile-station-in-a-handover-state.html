SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING TRAFFIC DISTRIBUTION IN<br>
A MOBILE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a traffic control system and method in<br>
a mobile communication system, and in particular, to a system and method for<br>
controlling reverse traffic.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Generally, in a mobile communication svstem. data transmission can be divided<br>
into forward data transmission and reverse data transmission. "Forward data<br>
transmission" refers to data transmission from a base station to a mobile station, while<br>
"reverse data transmission" refers to data transmission from a mobile station to a base<br>
station. According to the type of transmission data, mobile communication systems can<br>
be classified into systems supporting only a voice service, systems supporting a<br>
combination of a voice service and a simple data service, and systems supporting only a<br>
high-speed data service. The advent of such a mobile communication system providing a<br>
data service is the result of rapid development of mobile communication technology in<br>
answer to increasing users" demands for transmitting/receiving more information at<br>
higher speeds.<br>
In such a mobile communication system processing data at high speed, reverse<br>
data traffic is transmitted over a packet data channel by the physical layer packet (PLP),<br>
and a length of the data traffic is fixed. Packets have a variable data rate, and a data rate<br>
of each packet is determined depending on power of a mobile station, an amount of<br>
transmission data, and a rate control bit (RCB) transmitted from a base station over a<br>
rate control channel (RCCH).<br>
In addition, a data rate of a mobile station is determined by scheduling. A base<br>
station performs scheduling using RoT (Rise over Thermal) representing total reception<br>
power over thermal noises or a load obtained from a received signal-to-noise ratio of a<br>
mobile station belonging to a current base transceiver system (BTS). When RoT is<br>
available, scheduling is performed so that RoT is matched to a predetermined reference<br><br>
RoT level, and when RoT is unavailable, scheduling is performed so that a load is<br>
matched to a predetermined reference load level. For the convenience of explanation.<br>
RoT is used herein.<br>
Thus, a scheduler in a base station determines whetner to increase, decrease or<br>
hold a data rate of a corresponding mobile station, considering RoT. and a buffer status<br>
and a power status of each mobile station.<br>
FIG. 1 is a diagram for explaining the configuration and operation scheme for<br>
controlling a mobile station in an existing system. As illustrated in FIG. 1. a base station<br>
(BS) is comprised of base transceiver systems (BTSs) and a base station controller<br>
(BSC). A BTS manages its cell(s). and a BSC is connected to a plurality of BTSs and<br>
controls the BTSs connected thereto. In addition, as illustrated in FIG. 1. each mobile<br>
station undergoes reverse data rate control from a BTS to which it belongs. A mobile<br>
station in a non-soft handover (non-SHO) state (hereinafter referred to as "non-SHO<br>
mobile station"1) undergoes reverse data rate control from only a BTS to which it belongs,<br>
while a mobile station in a soft handover (SHO) state (hereinafter referred to as "SHO<br>
mobile station") undergoes reverse data rate control from a plurality of BTSs in an active<br>
set. Herein, a non-SHO mobile station refers to a mobile station in a non-SHO state,<br>
while an SHO mobile station refers to a mobile station in an SHO state. In FIG. 1,<br>
mobile stations 111 and 113 each belonging to one BTS are controlled by their BTSs 101<br>
and 102, respectively, and another mobile station 112 belonging to both BTSs becomes<br>
an SHO mobile station which is simultaneously controlled by the BTSs 101 and 102.<br>
In an SHO mobile station controlled by a plurality of BTSs. reverse rate control<br>
messages received from the BTSs are different from each other. In this regard, a rate<br>
control procedure will now be described with reference to FIG. 1. A BTS#1 101 and a<br>
BTS#2 102 each transmit a rate control command to a mobile station according to their<br>
RoT conditions. For example. BTS#1 101 can send a rate-down command to the mobile<br>
station, while BTS#2 102 can send a rate-up command to the mobile station. In this case,<br>
the mobile station obeys a command from any one of the BTSs. and commonly,<br>
according to "Or-of-Down' rule, the mobile station decreases it data rate if any one of the<br>
BTSs issues a rate-down command. This is because a scheduler in each BTS determines<br>
a data rate of each mobile station so that a received RoT maintains a reference RoT. and<br>
if a mobile station receiving a rate-down command increases its data rate, a received<br><br>
RoT of a corresponding BTS will undesirably exceed the reference RoT.<br>
When a received RoT exceeding the reference RoT in a particular BTS. an<br>
increase in an interference level may occur, resulting in a reduction in throughput of a<br>
corresponding cell. Therefore, in order to secure stability of the entire system, if a<br>
mobile station receives different rate control commands from a plurality of BTSs. the<br>
mobile station determines whether there is any rate-down command among the received<br>
rate control commands. If there is any rate-down command, the mobile station decreases<br>
the current data rate and transmits data at the decreased data rate.<br>
However, even the use of the "Or-of-Down" rule cannot resolve the inefficiency<br>
problem. A scheduler in a BTS determines a data rate of each mobile station so that a<br>
received RoT maintains a reference RoT. However, if a mobile station receiving a rate-<br>
up command from a particular BTS decreases it data rate, a received RoT of the BTS<br>
becomes lower than a reference RoT. This means that available resources are not<br>
sufficiently utilized, also leading to a reduction in throughput of a corresponding cell.<br>
Similar situations occur even in a case where reverse Hybrid Automatic Repeat<br>
and Request (HARQ) is used. A description will now be made of an operation performed<br>
in such a case. If reverse data is received, a BTS must transmit an ACK or NACK signal<br>
to a mobile station over an acknowledgment channel (hereinafter referred to as "ACK<br>
channel"). In the case where the mobile station is a non-SHO mobile station, a<br>
corresponding BTS determines an ACK or NACK signal and then transmits the<br>
determined signal. However, in the case where the mobile station is an SHO mobile<br>
station, signals received from respective BTSs connected to the mobile station can be<br>
different from each other. This will be described below with reference to FIG. 1. For<br>
example, BTS#1 101 can successfully receive a packet transmitted by the mobile station<br>
112. while BTS#2 102 fails to receive the packet transmitted by the mobile station 112.<br>
In this case. BTS#1 101 transmits an ACK signal to the mobile station 112 and BTS#2<br>
102 transmits a NACK signal to the mobile station 112. The mobile station 112 receiving<br>
such signals transmits the next packet because it received from BTS#1 101 an ACK<br>
signal indicating successful receipt of a previous packet. However. BTS#2 102 expects<br>
that the previous packet will be retransmitted, since it failed to successfully receive the<br>
previous packet, i.e.. it transmitted a NACK signal to the mobile station 112. In this case,<br>
a signal for determining whether each cell has successfully received a packet is needed<br><br>
between BTS#1 101 and BTS#2 102. However, such signaling can act as an overhead.<br>
That is. when BTS#1 101 transmits ACK and BTS#2 102 transmits NACK. the mobile<br>
station 112 transmits a new packet since it received ACK. but BTS#2 102 expects<br>
retransmission of the previous packet. Therefore, tor more accurate operation, it is<br>
necessary to inform BTS#2 that BTS#1 transmitted ACK. through signaling via a<br>
network.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described in detail<br>
with reference to the annexed drawings. In the drawings, the same or similar elements<br>
are denoted by the same reference numerals even though they are depicted in different<br>
drawings. In the following description, a detailed description of known functions and<br>
configurations incorporated herein has been omitted for conciseness.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, a BSC performs rate control in an<br>
SHO state and rate control in a non-SHO state in a different manner. That is. rate control<br>
on an SHO mobile station is performed by a BSC. while rate control on a non-SHO<br>
mobile station is performed by BTSs. In the following description, the present invention<br>
will be applied to rate control. Actually, however, the invention can be applied not only<br>
to rate control but also to response signal control. For this, a reverse control message is<br>
used. The reverse control message is classified into a rate control bit (RCB) which is a<br>
reverse rate control bit. and a grant message. The reverse rate control bit can be<br>
 transmitted to instruct increase, decrease or hold of the current rate to instruct increase<br>
 decrease of the current rate. On the other hand, the grant message can be transmitted<br>
to instruct a corresponding mobile station to perform reverse control at a certain rate<br>
from the next slot. For example, if a mobile station, currently performing reverse<br>
transmission at 9.6 Kbps. receives a grant message granting transmission at 38.4 Kbps.<br>
the mobile station can perform reverse transmission at 38.4 Kbps. skipping the next rate<br>
of 19.6 Kbps. In the following description. RCB is used for reverse rate control.<br>
However, the grant message can also be used for reverse rate control.<br>
In addition, a response signal (or ACK/NACK signal) can be included in the<br>
reverse control message. In some cases, a message received from a SHO mobile station<br>
via a particular BTS is good while a message received from the SHO mobile station via<br>
another BTS is bad. In this case, a BSC transmits an ACK signal, a response signal<br>
indicating 'Good' reception, to the SHO mobile station. A description of such an<br>
example will be made below.<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating control function blocks for explaining<br>
operations of BTSs and a BSC during rate control on an SHO mobile station and a non-<br>
SHO mobile station according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. With<br>
reference to FIG. 2, a detailed description will now be made of control functions and<br>
other functions of BTSs and a BSC during rate control on an SHO mobile station and a<br>
non-SHO mobile station according to the present invention.<br>
Respective reverse control function blocks 201. ..... 20N of BTSs (hereinafter<br>
referred to as "BTS control function blocks") perform reverse rate control on non-SHO<br>
mobile stations. Such rate control is performed in the existing method where a BTS<br>
controls a data rate of a mobile station. Therefore, signaling and call assignment on a<br>
non-SHO mobile station are performed by the BSC like in the existing method (However.<br><br>
the BTS control function blocks 201. .... 20N according to the present invention are<br>
designed not to perform reverse rate control on an SHO mobile station. A control<br>
function block 210 of a BSC (hereinafter referred to as 'BSC control function block")<br>
controls BTSs in the existing method.) In addition, the BSC control function block 210<br>
performs reverse rate control on an SHO mobile station according to the present<br>
invention. /That is, the BSC control function block 210 controls a data rate of an SHO<br>
mobile station and controls transmission of a signal transmitted over an ACK channel.<br>
A detailed description will now be made of operations of the BTS control<br>
function blocks 201, ..., 20N and the BSC control function block 210 when a mobile<br>
station transitions from a non-SHO state to an SHO state.<br>
When a mobile station is in a non-SHO state. i.e., when it belongs to only one<br>
BTS. the BTS control function block 201 allows the corresponding mobile station to<br>
undergo reverse data rate control only from that BTS. That is. the BTS control function<br>
block 201 generates a rate control bit and an ACK bit, and transmits them to the mobile<br>
station. However, various functions such as call-in, call-out, signaling, data rate control,<br>
and ACK/NACK detection from a received signal, are controlled by a BSC like in the<br>
existing method.<br>
In the meantime, if the mobile station transitions to an SHO state, the BTS<br>
control function block 201 generates information on a handover action time and an<br>
active set of a mobile station, and transmits the generated information to the<br>
corresponding mobile station. In addition, since subsequent control is performed by the<br>
BSC, the BSC control function block 210 determines whether assignment of a new rate<br>
control channel is needed. At the same time, the BSC control function block 210<br>
determines whether assignment of an ACK channel is necessary. As a result of the<br>
determinations, if new channels are needed, the BSC control function block 210<br>
generates new rate control channel information and new ACK channel information, and<br>
sends the generated channel information to the mobile station. Since the BTS control<br>
function block 201 cannot know the states of other BTSs, the BSC control function<br>
block 210 determines whether to assign new channels, and if assignment of new<br>
channels is required, the BSC control function block 210 controls the BTS so as to set up<br>
new channels to the mobile station transitioning to the SHO state. In other words, the<br>
BTS forms a message using handover action time information, active set information<br><br>
and new channel assignment information received from the BSC control function block<br>
210. and transmits the formed message to the corresponding mobile station. As a result,<br>
new channels are assigned between the BTS and the mobile station.<br>
Next, a description will be made of a control operation when the SHO mobile<br>
station enters the area of a particular BTS, ending its SHO state. When the SHO mobile<br>
station enters the area of a particular BTS. i.e.. when handover is ended, the BSC control<br>
function block 210 instructs a corresponding BTS control function block to which the<br>
mobile station belongs to individually control a reverse data rate of the mobile station. A<br>
description will now be made of an operation performed in such a case.<br>
A delay time of a control message transmitted to a mobile station that undergoes<br>
reverse data rate control from the BSC control function block 210 is different from a<br>
delay time of a control message transmitted to a mobile station that undergoes reverse<br>
data rate control from a BTS. When a mobile station receives reverse rate control<br>
information from a BSC. a delay of about 2 frames occurs. Here, the "frame" becomes a<br>
data transmission unit for the reverse rate control information transmitted over a forward<br>
rate control channel. Therefore, when the mobile station is subject to reverse data rate<br>
control from the BSC, an ACK/NACK signal transmitted over an ACK channel may<br>
suffer transmission failure. For example, assuming that a BTS generates and transmits an<br>
ACK/NACK signal in answer to a signal received from a mobile station within a time of<br>
2 frames (or 1 frame), if the BTS transmits a NACK signal responsive to data received at<br>
a current time (time #1) to the mobile station at a particular time (time #2). the mobile<br>
station retransmits a corresponding frame at a time #3 in response to the NACK signal<br>
received. The time #1, the time #2 and the time #3 occur in sequence. Therefore, each of<br>
the times can be either a transmission time in an air state, or a time required when<br>
determining a type of received information after completing error check on a received<br>
frame.<br>
However, since the SHO mobile station is subject to reverse data rate control<br>
from the BSC. a longer delay time occurs than when the mobile station undergoes<br>
reverse data rate control by the BTS. Actually, a lime delay of at least 1 frame occurs<br>
when a signal is transmitted from a mobile station to a BSC via a BTS and then a NACK<br>
signal responsive to the corresponding signal is generated by the BSC and transmitted to<br>
the mobile station via the corresponding BTS. That is, if the BSC generates a NACK<br><br>
signal in response to a reception signal transmitted 1 frame ahead of the current time (or<br>
time 41) and transmits the generated NACK signal to a corresponding mobile station, the<br>
mobile station retransmits a corresponding framed the time #3. In this case, if handover<br>
has ended, the BSC transmits an ACK/NACK signal to the mobile station in response to<br>
a previous frame, and the corresponding BTS controls a data rate of the mobile station<br>
from the time when handover ended. Therefore, when the BSC transmits an<br>
ACK/NACK signal to the mobile station in response to a frame received at a previous<br>
time, the BTS transmits an ACK/NACK signal in response to a frame received after<br>
handover ended. In this case, the mobile station receives retransmission requests for<br>
different data frames at the same time, so the ACK/NACK signal received from the BSC<br>
collides with the ACK/NACK signal received from the BTS.<br>
Generally, a delay time of a control message transmitted when a mobile station<br>
is controlled by a BSC is longer than that of a control message transmitted when the<br>
mobile station is controlled by a BTS/Therefore, if a mobile station transitions from a<br>
non-SHO state to an SHO state, a transmission time of an ACK/NACK signal becomes<br>
longer. In this case, the ACK/NACK signal is normally transmitted regardless of whether<br>
the mobile station is assigned a new channel or uses an existing channel. (However, if the<br>
mobile station transitions from the SHO state to the non-SHO state, a transmission time<br>
of an ACK/NACK signal becomes shorter. Therefore, if the existing channel is used, the<br>
BTS and the mobile station both should transmit ACK/NACK signals for two packets at<br>
the same time, which is undesirable.<br>
In this case, in the embodiment of the present invention, packet transmission is<br>
suspended for a period as much as a difference in a transmission time of the<br>
ACK/NACK signal between the BTS and the BSC. In an alternative method, when the<br>
mobile station transitions from the non-SHO state to the SHO state, the BTS assigns a<br>
new ACK channel to the corresponding mobile station. In this way, a response<br>
(ACK/NACK) signal generated while the mobile station undergoes data rate control<br>
from the BSC is transmitted over an ACK channel assigned when the mobile station<br>
undergoes data rate control by the BTS. and a response signal for a new packet is<br>
transmitted over an ACK channel newly assigned by the current BTS. In the latter<br>
method, the mobile station has two ACK channels corresponding to a transmission delay<br>
time between the BTS and the BSC, and the BTS must hold the two ACK channels<br>
assigned to the mobile station.<br><br>
A description will now be made of an operation of the BSC control function<br>
block 210 according to above-stated two embodiments of the present invention. The<br>
BSC control function block 210 performs a general control function. In an SHO state,<br>
when an inquiry about whether assignment of a new channel to an SHO mobile station is<br>
needed is received from the BTS control function block 201. the BSC control function<br>
block 210 checks a state of target BTSs to which a call is to be handed over, and then<br>
sends the result information to the inquiring BTS. In addition, if a reverse rate control<br>
request for the SHO mobile station is received from the BTS control function block 201.<br>
the BSC control function block 210 controls a data rate of the SHO mobile station<br>
considering a resource state of the corresponding BTSs. Furthermore, the BSC control<br>
function block 210 symbol-combines packets received from the mobile station via a<br>
source BTS that will hand over a current call and target BTSs to which the call is to be<br>
handed over, and checks whether the combined received packet is good or bad. If the<br>
received packet is good, the BSC control function block 210 transmits an ACK signal<br>
over an ACK channel set up between each BTS in the handover operation and the<br>
mobile station, and if the received packet is bad, the BSC control function block 210<br>
transmits a NACK signal over the ACK channel set up between each BTS in the<br>
handover operation and the mobile station.<br>
Thereafter, if handover of the mobile station has ended, the BSC control<br>
function block 210 transmits an ACK/NACK signal for the packet received from a<br>
corresponding mobile station to the mobile station over a channel that was set up during<br>
handover. In a first embodiment of the above-stated two embodiments, the BSC control<br>
function block 210 controls a BTS so as to suspend reverse data transmission between<br>
the BTS and the mobile station for a predetermined time. Unlike this, in the second<br>
embodiment, the BSC control function block 210 transmits an ACK/NACK signal over a<br>
separate channel instead of a channel which was in the handover operation, as a channel<br>
for ACK/NACK transmission between the mobile station and the BTS. After an ACK<br>
signal for a final frame received from the BSC is transmitted, the channel is released.<br>
However, the channel transmitting an ACK/NACK signal, set up between the BTS<br>
currently controlling the mobile station and the BSC. is continuously held. The BSC<br>
control function block 210 instructs the BTS control function block 201 to control a<br>
reverse data rate of the handover-ended mobile station.<br><br>
When the BSC controls a data rate of an SHO mobile station in this way. a BTS<br>
subtracts capacity corresponding to a data rate of a corresponding mobile station from<br>
the total capacity and controls a data rate of mobile stations in its area based on RoT or<br>
load at the remaining capacity, thus contributing to an increase in throughput of the BTS.<br>
In addition, BTSs are prevented from transmitting different ACK/NACK signals to the<br>
SHO mobile station, contributing to an increase in BTS efficiency and making it<br>
possible to easily control the mobile station.<br>
As a BSC controls an SHO mobile station, a mobile station is not separately<br>
controlled by a plurality of BTSs included in its active set. and receives the same signal<br>
from the BTSs by the BSC. Therefore, it is possible to increase reception capability of<br>
packet data and an ACK/NACK channel signal through soft-combining on the received<br>
signals.<br>
FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating a procedure for performing handover of a<br>
mobile station in a BTS control function block according to a preferred embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
In step 300. the BTS control function block 201 measures the total RoT or a<br>
load of a BTS. The total RoT can be measured at a predetermined time, and the load can<br>
be calculated by the BTS depending on a state of the current reverse link. Therefore,<br>
when the load is used for control, the BTS control function block 201 continuously<br>
measures the load, and when control is performed based on RoT. the BTS control<br>
function block 201 measures the RoT every predetermined time.<br>
When measurement of RoT is completed or calculation of a load is completed,<br>
the BTS control function block 201 proceeds to step 302. In step 302. the BTS control<br>
function block 201 receives a reverse load of a mobile station controlled by a BSC<br>
because handover is in progress. The reverse load is a value received from a BSC. and<br>
the BSC provides this information to the BTS continuously or at stated periods.<br>
Therefore, in step 304, the BTS receiving the reverse load calculates reverse loads of<br>
non-SHO mobile stations, i.e.. mobile stations whose reverse data rates are controlled by<br>
the BTS control function block 201 according to the present invention.<br>
Thereafter, the BTS control function block 201 proceeds to step 306. In step<br><br>
306. the BTS control function block 201 calculates capacity of a currently available<br>
reverse link from the value determined in steps 300 to 304. In addition, the BTS control<br>
function block 201 controls a reverse data rate of a non-SHO mobile station controlled<br>
by a BTS according to the currently available reverse link. Furthermore, in step 306. the<br>
BTS control function block 201 transmits a response (ACK/NACK) signal for a reverse<br>
packet received from a mobile station. The BTS control function block 201 determines<br>
in step 308 whether a message indicating occurrence of a handover state for a mobile<br>
station controlled by the BTS is received from the BSC. If it is determined in step 308<br>
that there is a mobile station in an SHO state, the BTS control function block 201<br>
proceeds to step 310 where it excludes the corresponding mobile station from mobile<br>
stations whose reverse rates are being controlled. That is. reverse rate control by the BTS<br>
is suspended. Thereafter, the BTS control function block 201 returns to step 300. and<br>
measures RoT or a load. When the BTS control function block 201 operates based on<br>
RoT. if the current time is not a predetermined RoT measurement time, the BTS control<br>
function block 201 proceeds to step 302 without performing the measurement of RoT or<br>
a load. In this manner, rapid reverse rate control can be performed on a mobile station in<br>
communication with only a BTS. Also, at step 308. if it is determined that there are no<br>
mobile stations in an SHO state, the process returns to step 300.<br>
Meanwhile, though not illustrated in FIG. 3, when a particular mobile station<br>
controlled by a BSC enters a particular BTS. there is a case where reverse rate control<br>
should be performed on the mobile station. In this case, the BTS measures RoT or load<br>
of the corresponding mobile station during RoT measurement or load measurement of<br>
step 300, and performs reverse rate control on the mobile station. In addition, for such a<br>
rate control time, a separate channel can be used or a method of suspending reverse<br>
transmission for a predetermined time can be used.<br>
FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating a procedure for performing handover of a<br>
mobile station in a BSC control function block according to a preferred embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
In step 400. the BSC control function block 210 holds a call control state. Here,<br>
"'call control state" refers to a state in which transmission of call assignment and control<br>
messages for a mobile station is controlled through a BTS, and according to the present<br>
invention, reverse rate control for a non-SHO mobile station is not included. For such<br><br>
mobile stations, reverse rate control is performed in the BTS as described in conjunction<br>
with FIG. 3. Holding such a call control state, the BSC control function block 210<br>
proceeds to step 402 where it determines whether there is a mobile station in an SHO<br>
state. If it is determined in step 402 that there is a mobile station in an SHO state, the<br>
BSC control function block 210 proceeds to step 404. and otherwise, the BSC control<br>
function block 210 returns to step 400.<br>
In step 404, the BSC control function block 210 transmits a call handover (or<br>
call transfer) message to the BTS. That is. the BSC control function block 210 transmits<br>
to a corresponding BTS a message for suspending reverse rate control on a mobile<br>
station controlled by the BTS. Furthermore, in step 404. the BSC control function block<br>
210 determines an active set and a handover action time of the mobile station to be<br>
handed over (i.e., an SHO mobile station). Thereafter, in step 406, the BSC control<br>
function block 210 determines whether assignment of a reverse s:ate channel and an ACK<br>
channel for transmitting an ACK/NACK signal is needed for the SHO mobile station. If<br>
it is determined in step 406 that channel assignment is necessary, the BSC control<br>
function block 210 proceeds to step 408, and otherwise, the BSC control function block<br>
210 proceeds to step 410.<br>
In step 408, the BSC control function block 210 assigns new channels to the<br>
SHO mobile station, and transmits a channel assignment message via a BTS currently in<br>
communication with the mobile station in order to inform the mobile station of the<br>
newly assigned channels.<br>
Thereafter, in step 410, the BSC control function block 210 controls a reverse<br>
data rate of the SHO mobile station considering states of BTSs in communication with<br>
the SHO mobile station among BTSs included in the active set of the SHO mobile<br>
station. At this point, an ACK/NACK signal received from the mobile station is also<br>
transmitted to the BSC without being processed in the BTS. Therefore, the BSC control<br>
function block 210 performs data retransmission or new data transmission depending on<br>
information received from the mobile station.<br>
As the SHO mobile station is controlled by the BSC. the mobile station can<br>
receive a consistent ACK signal, and since the mobile station receives the same message,<br>
the mobile station can increase reception probability by soft-combining the received<br><br>
message.<br>
After performing rate control on a reverse link of a particular mobile station in<br>
step 410, the BSC control function block 210 proceeds to step 412 where it determines<br>
whether handover of the SHO mobile station is ended. That is. the BSC control function<br>
block 210 determines whether the mobile station enters the area of a particular BTS and<br>
performs communication only in the BTS. If it is determined in step 412 that handover is<br>
ended, the BSC control function block 210 proceeds to step 414 where it generates a<br>
control handover (or control transfer) message for instructing a BTS where the mobile<br>
station is located to perform reverse rate control, and delivers the generated control<br>
handover message. Therefore, if handover of the mobile station is ended, transmission<br>
control on a reverse rate and an ACK signal is handed over to another BTS by the<br>
particular BTS. After the step 414, the BSC control function block 210 returns to step<br>
400. At step 412. if it is determined that handover has not ended, the process returns to<br>
step 410.<br>
Next, with reference to FIG. 5, a description will be made of the connection<br>
between a BTS apparatus and a BSC apparatus, and their internal structures. FIG. 5 is a<br>
block diagram illustrating internal structures of a BTS apparatus and a BSC apparatus<br>
according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In FIG. 5. reference numeral 510 represents an internal structure of a BSC<br>
apparatus, and reference numeral 520 represents an internal structure of a BTS apparatus.<br>
It should be noted that only the essential elements associated with the present invention<br>
are shown in FIG. 5.<br>
First, a description will be made of internal structure and operation of the BSC<br>
510. A controller 511 of the BSC 510 includes the BSC control function block 210<br>
described in connection with FIG. 2, and thus performs a control operation according to<br>
the present invention. Data needed in the controller 511 is stored in a memory 512. That<br>
is, the memory 512 stores data needed for performing the procedure of FIG. 4. In<br>
addition, the memory 512 stores various data necessary for controlling an SHO mobile<br>
station. Using such data, the controller 511 generates a message for controlling a<br>
corresponding moBTIe station, or a message for controlling a corresponding BTS. A data<br>
processor 514 divides forward data to be transmitted to a particular mobile station in a<br><br>
proper size, or combines data received from the mobile station to transmit it to an upper<br>
layer. An interface 513 performs interfacing on data exchanged between the BSC 510<br>
and the BTS 520.<br>
Next, a description will be made of internal structure and operation of the BSC<br>
520. The BTS 520 includes an interface 522 for performing interfacing on data received<br>
from the BSC 510, and a controller 521 for performing a control operation according to<br>
the present invention. The controller 521 includes the BTS control function block<br>
described in connection with FIG. 2. Thus, the controller 521 performs reverse control<br>
on only a non-SHO mobile station. Even when reverse control is performed by the BSC<br>
510. a message is actually transmitted from the BTS 520 to a mobile station. Therefore,<br>
when a request for transmission of a control message for an SHO mobile station is<br>
received from the BSC 510. the controller 521 generates a control message. Alternatively,<br>
however, the BSC 510 can directly generate such a message and transmit the generated<br>
message.<br>
A switch 523 performs a switching operation for transmitting forward data to be<br>
transmitted to each mobile station or reverse data received from each mobile station to<br>
the interface 522. and transmitting data received from the controller 521 to the BSC 510.<br>
In some cases, the switch 523 can be implemented with dedicated lines. However, it is<br>
implemented herein with a general switch. Data to be transmitted to a particular mobile<br>
station is processed in a modem section 524 and a radio frequency (RF) section 525. The<br>
processed data is transmitted to a mobile station via an antenna. The modem section 524<br>
and the RF section 525 include N modems 524-1 to 524-N and N RF modules 525-1 to<br>
525-N. respectively, and each modem-RF module pair is associated with its<br>
corresponding mobile station. The modem section 524 encodes and modulates data to be<br>
transmitted in a forward direction, and demodulates and decodes data received in a<br>
reverse direction. The RF section 525 performs up-conversion and power amplification<br>
to transmit forward transmission data to a corresponding mobile station, and performs<br>
low-noise amplification and down-conversion on reverse reception data to generate a<br>
baseband signal. The modem section 524 and the RF' section 525 constitute a packet<br>
transceiver. During handover of a mobile station, the BSC 510 and the BTS 520 perform<br>
the control operation described in connection with FIGs. 2 to 4. so a detailed described<br>
thereof will be omitted for simplicity.<br><br>
As described above, mobile stations are divided into a mobile station whose<br>
handover is performed by the BSC and a mobile station whose handover is not<br>
performed by the BSC, to control reverse traffic on a distributed basis. In this case, the<br>
same control information can be transmitted to the mobile station. In addition, rate<br>
control on an SHO mobile station and transmission of a signal for HARQ become simple.<br>
Moreover, a non-SHO mobile station undergoes reverse rate control from a BTS. thus<br>
contributing to rapid rate control.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to a certain<br>
