This  invention  relates  to  a  TWIN  LEVER  WORM AND ROLLER  STEERING  GEAR  for  a  tractor<br>
In India, tractors are mostly fitted with manual<br>
steering gears of the single lever type or the twin<br>
lever  type,	-<br>
Both the known single lever type and the twin lever type  of  steering  gears  have  their  drawbacks.<br>
The  known single  lever type  is provided with  a  ball screw  and  nut  (with  recirculating  balls) ,  or  worm and toothed roller  arrangement.  In  such  single  lever types,  during operation of  the  tractor  in  the  field, "FREE  PLAY"  develops  due  to  wear  between ;<br>
Ball  screw nut  and rocker  shaft<br>
Worm and  toothed  roller An adjuster  screw  is  provided  to  take  up  the  play; however,  this  screw  will  have  to  be  adjusted,  by the operator,  from time  to time,  manually,  to  reduce the play to a tolerable  level.<br>
The known twin lever type is provided with ball screw and nut (with recirculating balls) , The nut has rack teeth which meshes with a first gear. The first gear has conical teeth all round the circumference. The first gear . meshes 'with a second conical gear which has gear teeth over a segment of circumference. In this case also, adjuster screws are provided to take up the play; however, these screws will have to be adjusted, by the operator, from time to time, manually, to reduce the play to a tolerable  level.<br><br>
The steering gear free play is a major irritant during tractor operation in the Held. Driving the tractor, therefore, is never comfortable with this drawback associated with both the known single and twin lever types.<br>
This invention seeks to overcome the free play drawback referred to above. Additionally, this invention provides a more effective drive arrangement as will be clear from the following further description.<br>
The twin lever worm and roller manual steering gear for a tractor, according to this invention, comprises a steering column provided with a worm; a toothed roller meshing with the worm, the said roller moving on a circular arc along the worm, whenever the steering column, and thus the worm, rotates, said toothed roller being housed in an opening of the primary rocker shaft and attached to the said opening such that it has freedom to roll freely; first segmental gear teeth provided on the primary rocker shaft opposite the said opening; second segmental gear teeth provided on the secondary rocker shaft and meshing with the first segmental gear teeth, said worm being spaced from the said roller to provide a clearance sufficient to avoid the roller and worm ""sticking'.<br><br>
The worm and toothed roller are so spaced to provide sufficient clearance to prevent sticking as the toothed roller traverses along the arc of the worm. The self-acting free play mechanism between the toothed roller housed in the Primary Rocker shaft is achieved by continuously urging the said toothed roller against the worm by means of spring loading device in the Primary rocker shaft. The second self-acting free play adjustment is achieved by continuously urging the second conical gear against the first conical gear tooth by means of spring loading device in the secondary rocker shaft.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to  the  accompanying drawings  which  illustrate  in<br>
Fig. 1(a). and Fig. 1(b) the known single lever steering gear with ball  screw  and nut with recirculating balls<br>
Fig.2(a) and Fig.2 (b) the known single lever steering gear  with worm and toothed  roller.<br>
Fig.3(a) and Fig.3(b) the known twin lever steering gear with ball screw and nut with recirculating balls.<br>
Fig. 4 (a) and Fig. 4 (b) , by way of example, one of possible embodiments of the TWIN LEVER WORM &amp; ROLLER STEERING  GEAR  according lo  this  invention.<br>
referring to Figs.l (a) and 1 (b) , one of the known single lever types of steering gear is provided with a worm W and a main nut N coupled to the worm W through  recirculating balls B.<br><br>
As the steering column C is rotated, the nut N travels "linearly along the worm W to cause a stub S to actuate a fork F of the rocker shaft and thence a  drop  arm A to  turn  the  wheels  of  the  tractor.<br>
Referring to Figs.2(a) and 2(b); another version of the known single lever type steering gear is provided with worm W and toothed roller R engaging with the worm W. As the steering column C is rotated the toothed roller R engaging with worm W traverses in a circular arc along the worm driving the rocker shaft T and  thence  the  drop  arm A.<br>
In such single lever types, during operation of the tractor in the field, free play develops in the steering' mechanism. An adjuster screw H is provided to take up the play; however, this screw will have to be adjusted, by the operator, from time to time, manually,  to  reduce  the  play  to  a  tolerable  level -<br>
Referring to Fig.3(a) and Fig.3(b),the known twin lever with a worm W and nut N- is coupled to the worm W through recirculating balls B. As the steering column C is rotated the nut N traverse linearly along the worm W and rack teeth J provided on the nut N, meshes with the conical teeth of the primary rocker shaft thus actuating the primary rocker shaft to rotate about its axis- The conical gear tooth Kl of primary rocker shaft meshes with the conical segmental gear tooth K2 of the secondary rocker shaft thus activating the secondary rocker shaft to roate about its axis.<br>
In this case also, adjuster screws H are provided to  take  up  the  play;    however,   these  screws  will<br><br>
have to be adjusted, by the operator, from time to time , manually , to reduce the p1ay to a tolerable level. Such an arrangement is not possible with the  known barrel type spur gear design-<br>
__, -<br><br>
The arrangement pertaining to the embodiment just described is mechanically more effective than that of the manual steerins gears known to the art; and results in comfortable operation of the tractor continuously free from any play or possibility of the roller and worm 'sticking'.<br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation since It will be appreciated that various other embodiments of the steering<br>
gear proposed herein are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br><br>
