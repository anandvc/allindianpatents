GRANULAR AGROCHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND METHOD OF PRODUCING THE SAME <br><br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br><br>
 [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a granular agrochemical composition and a method of producing the same. More specifically, the invention relates to a method of     producing a granular agrochemical composition that uses a powdered agrochemical composition as a starting raw material and is able to produce the granular composition without altering the formulation of the composition, as well as an agrochemical composition produced using the method. The granular agrochemical composition of the present invention exhibits excellent properties in terms of ease of handling, ease of measurability, prevention of dust of the chemical agent and ease of application, and is therefore very useful in the field of agriculture.<br>
Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2008-11499S, filed April 25,2008, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br><br><br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Powdered products, granular products, wettable powders and water-soluble products have conventionally been used as solid agrochemical products. Particularly in the case of application to fruit trees and vegetables and the like, wettable powders, water-<br>
soluble products or liquid products have generally been preferred in order to eliminate soiling caused by adhesion of the agrochemical to the surfaces of the fruit and vegetables.<br><br><br>
[0003]<br>
Wettable powders and water-soluble products are mainly provided in a powdered<br>
form, but powdered products suffer a number of drawbacks, including (1) a low apparent<br>
specific gravity and high bulk, (2) airborne scattering of the chemical agent during<br>
weighing or preparation of a liquid product, leading to potential absorption by workers or<br>
the surrounding environment, and (3) poor flowability due to the powdered state, making<br>
weighing difficult<br><br><br>
[0004]<br>
One possible countermeasure to these types of problems involves packaging the wettable powder or water-soluble product using a water-soluble film or water-soluble paper, and then using a technique such as heat sealing to produce a sealed packaged product However, when these types of packaged products are diluted to prepare spray    solutions, residues of the water-soluble film that have not completely dissolved in the dilute solution may cause blockages of the spray nozzles, making spraying impossible. Accordingly, with existing wettable powders and water-soluble products, a technique that provides ready workability and superior safety for the operator, and is also able to resolve the problem of spray nozzle blockages has yet to be developed.<br><br><br>
[0005]<br>
Against this type of background, there has been a growing demand for granular products in recent years.<br>
Granular products, and specifically granulated wettable powders and granular water-soluble products offer various advantages, including (1) a higher apparent specific gravity than wettable powders or water-soluble products with less bulkiness, (2) no<br>
airborne scattering of fine powders during suspension in water to prepare spray liquids, meaning there is no danger of operators absorbing chemical agents, and (3) easier weighing of the products.<br><br><br>
[0006]<br><br>
In terms of production of granular agrochemical compositions, Patent Document<br>
1 discloses a method of producing a granular agrochemical composition that includes adding a predetermined amount of water to a mixture containing at least one agrochemical active ingredient and a surfactant, and then performing kneading to obtain a kneaded product, and subsequently granulating the thus obtained kneaded product by 0    grinding.<br><br><br>
[0007]<br>
Patent Document 2 discloses the method described below as a method of producing a granular agrochemical product. Namely, a mixture is prepared containing the agrochemical active ingredient and other components, and the mixture is pulverized i    using a mill. Subsequently, water is added to the pulverized material and kneaded to . obtain a kneaded product. The granular agrochemical product is then produced by subjecting the kneaded product to granulating, drying, grain size regulation and sieving.<br><br><br>
[0008]<br>
Generally, when producing agrochemical products, production of the product in a different form requires that the formulation for producing the product is developed from scratch. For example, a powdered product and a granular product are usually produced using different formulations even if the active ingredient is the same in each case. Developing these formulations requires considerable effort, and registration procedures must be performed for each different formulation.<br><br><br>
[0009]<br><br>
On the other hand, Patent Document 3 discloses a method of producing an agrochemical molded item, wherein by using a molded item of an agrochemical composition containing an agrochemical active ingredient and a thermoplastic material as a starting raw material, and subjecting the molded item to heating or a heat retention<br>
5   treatment, an agrochemical molded item having a different release rate can be produced without altering the shape of the molded item.<br>
The invention described in this document is an invention in which a product in the form of a molded item is subjected to an additional treatment, thus producing a product having different properties (release rate) from the properties at the time of<br>
D    molding, but the shape of the molded item does not change over the course of the treatment, and the invention does not provide a method of producing a product having a different form.<br><br><br>

DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br><br>
[0011]<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method of producing a granular agrochemical composition having excellent handing properties, wherein a wettable product or water-soluble product is converted only in form to a granular form without 5    altering the formulation thereof.<br><br>

They also discovered that granular agrochemical compositions could also be produced using other methods, and they were therefore able to complete the present invention.<br><br>
[0013]<br>
In other words, the present invention relates to: (1) a method of producing a granular agrochemical composition in which by conducting one of steps (1) to (5) below, followed by steps (a) and (b), a powdered agrochemical wettable composition or a powdered agrochemical water-soluble composition is converted in form to a granular agrochemical composition, without altering the components or component proportions within the composition:<br>
(1) a step of adding water to the powdered agrochemical wettable composition or powdered agrochemical water-soluble composition, and then performing kneading, extruding and drying,<br><br><br>
(2)	a step of adding water to the powdered agrochemical wettable composition or<br>
powdered agrochemical water-soluble composition, and then performing stirring granulation and drying,<br><br>
(3)	a step of adding water to the powdered agrochemical wettable composition or<br>
5    powdered agrochemical water-soluble composition, and then performing kneading and spray-drying,<br><br>
(4)	a step of adding water to the powdered agrochemical wettable composition or<br>

[0015]<br>
According to the present invention, a powdered agrochemical wettable 5    composition or a powdered agrochemical water-soluble composition can be converted only in form to a granular agrochemical composition without altering the formulation of the composition.<br>
By altering only the form of the composition to a granular form without changing the formulation of the wettable powder composition or water-soluble composition, mere 0    is no danger of the types of spray nozzle blockages that can occur when a packaged product is diluted. Further, because the obtained granular agrochemical composition does not suffer from dusting, and yet exhibits satisfactory disintegration and suspension properties, it satisfies the requirements for ease of handling and operator safety. Moreover, because the formulation need not be redeveloped, the labor required for research and the like can be reduced.<br><br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>

There are no particular limitations on the I    particle size of the powdered agrochemical composition, and for example, powdered products having particle sizes from 0.1 to 45 urn can be used.<br><br><br>
[0018]<br>
Specific examples of powdered wettable compositions and water-soluble compositions include the following agrochemical products, which are listed using their trade names (registered trademarks) followed by the names registered with the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in parentheses. Insecticides and acaricides such as ADMIRE wettable powder (imidacloprid wettable powder), PHOSKURIN wettable powder (isoxathion-methomyl wettable powder), LANNATE 45 wettable powder (methomyl wettable powder) and NISSORUN wettable powder (hexythiazox wettable powder), and fungicides and herbicides such as ALIETTE wettable powder (fosetyl wettable powder), ORTHOCIDE wettable powder 80 (Captan wettable powder), TOPSIN-M wettable powder (thiophanate-methyl wettable powder), TRIFMINE wettable powder (trifiumizole wettable powder), BENLATE wettable powder (benomyl wettable powder), B-NINE wettable powder 80 (diaminozide wettable powder), BELLKUTE wettable powder (iminoctadine albesillate wettable powder), MONCUT<br>
writable powder (flutolanil wettable powder), ROVRAL wettable powder (iprdione wettable powder), SIMAZINE (CAT wettable powder) and DIURON (DCMU wettable powder).<br><br><br>
[0019]<br><br>
Of these, a TOPSIN-M (a registered trademark) wettable powder, a TRUMNE<br>
(a registered trademark) wettable powder, a BELLKUTE (a registered trademark) wettable powder, or a NISSORUN (a registered trademark) wettable powder is preferred as the powdered agrochemical wettable composition.

[0020] (Granular agrochemical composition of the present invention)<br>
A granular agrochemical composition produced using the method of the present invention has the same product formulation and same component proportions as the product of agrochemical composition that  functions as the rawmaterial. The product formulation includes the agrochemical active ingredient, as well as carriers, extenders and surfactants and the like.<br><br><br>
[0021]<br>

The shape of the granular agrochemical composition produced in the present invention is amorphous. The grab size of the granules is preferably within a range from 50 to 2,000 urn, and more preferably from 100 to 800 urn. However, all of the granules need not necessarily have a grain size that falls within this range, provided that the grain size that represents the maximum within the total grain size distribution falls within this range.<br>
Grain sizes of 50 urn and smaller fall within the range for powdered wettable powders, and suppressing dusting of the composition during handling becomes difficult. In contrast, if the grain size exceeds 2,000 urn, then the water solubility of the composition tends to deteriorate.<br><br><br>
[0024]<br>
Furthermore, in order to ensure even better safety for users of the granular agrochemical composition of the present invention, the composition may be packaged using a water-soluble film or water-soluble paper, and then sealed by heat sealing or the like to produce a packaged product.<br><br><br>

The granular agrochemical composition is diluted with an appropriate amount of water, and can then be applied using a power sprayer or manual sprayer. The dilution ratio is typically within a range from 3- to 10,000-fold, and preferably from 5- to 8,000-fold.<br><br><br>
[0040]<br>
In the case where, for example, the granular agrochemical composition is used within an irrigation treatment of a rice seedling propagation box using wet-rice cultivation, the amount of the agrochemical composition used, reported as an equivalent amount of the agrochemical active ingredient per single rice seedling propagation box (typically having an area of approximately 0.16 m2) is typically within a range from 0.1 to 10 g, and preferably from 0.5 to 5 g.<br><br><br>
[0041]<br>
The dilution ratio of the granular agrochemical composition within the dilute liquid varies depending on the amount of the agrochemical active ingredient within the granular agrochemical composition and the situation in which the dilute liquid is to be applied, but is typically within a range from 3- to 10,000-fold, preferably from 5- to 8,000-fold, and still more preferably from 10- to 5,000-fold. The amount applied of a water-diluted liquid of the granular wettable powder of the present invention, per seedling propagation box, is typically within, a range from 100 to 2,000 ml, and preferably from 200 to 1,500 ml. Examples of the method used for applying the dilute<br>
18 liquid include methods that involve application using a watering can, sprinkler or shuttle litigation device, and methods in which the liquid is applied using irrigation equipment provided on a seedling propagation box seeding machine.<br><br><br>
[0042]<br>
Furthermore, there are no particular limitations on the timing of when the granular agrochemical composition of the present invention is applied, provided it is during the propagation period, although application is usually performed in the period from prior to seed sowing through until prior to transplanting. From the viewpoint of performing the application in a laborsaving manner, application is preferably performed at the same time as seed sowing or planting.<br><br><br>
EXAMPLES<br><br><br>
[0043]<br>
Examples of the present invention are described below, although the present invention is in no way limited by these examples.<br><br><br>
[0044] <br><br>
[Example 1] <br><br>
(Step1)<br>
A kneader (capacity: S00 L, manufactured by Dainippon Kogyo Co., Ltd.) was charged with 90 Kg of MOSPELAN wettable powder and water (amount of added water: 8%), and the resulting mixture was kneaded for 40 minutes. The kneaded material was then extruded through an extrusion granulator (twin dome granulator, model TDG-100, manufactured by Fuji Paudal Co., Ltd.) using a 0.8 mm$ screen. The extruded product was then dried and granulated by one passage through a vibrating fluidized bed dryer (model VDF10800, manufactured by Tokuju Corporation), yielded a granulated material.<br><br>
(Step 2)<br>
The granulated material having an extruded diameter of 0.8 M was ground using a grinder (Roll Granulator, manufactured by Nippon Granulator Co., Ltd.), yielded a granular agrochemical composition (product a) having the target grain size (grain size: 150 to 710 urn, maximum proportion: 500 to 600 urn). Grinding was performed using two stages of rollers, with a pitch of 0.6 and a clearance of 5 (0.43 mm) in the first stage, and a pitch of 0.6 and a clearance of 5 (0.43 mm) in the second stage. The yield of the target grain size was 94.5%.<br><br><br>
[0045]<br><br>
 [Example 2]<br>
With the exception of altering the grinding conditions in step 2 of example 1 to a pitch of 0.6 and a clearance of 0.6 (0.51 mm) in the first stage, and a pitch of 0.6 and a clearance of 5 (0.43 nun) in the second stage, a granular agrochemical composition (product b) was obtained in the same manner as example 1. The yield of the target grain size was 94.8%.<br><br>
[0046]<br><br>
 [Example 3]<br>
With the exception of altering the grinding conditions in step 2 of example 1 to a pitch of 0.6 and a clearance of 0.6 (0.51 mm) in the first stage, and a pitch of 0.6 and a clearance of 4 (0.35 mm) in the second stage, a granular agrochemical composition (product c) was obtained in the same manner as example 1. The yield of the target grain size was 94.9%.<br><br><br>
[0047] <br>
[Comparative example 1]<br>
Only step 1 of example 1 was performed, and a granulated product (product x) was obtained without performing grinding with a granulator.<br><br><br>
[0048] <br><br>
[Test example 1]<br>
For each of the obtained products a to c and x, a solubility test was performed using the procedure described below. Namely, 250 mL of tap water and 0.125 g (2,000-fold dilution) of the granular product were placed in a measuring cylinder and left to stand for 30 seconds. After 30 seconds, the measuring cylinder was inverted at a rate of one inversion every 2 seconds, and the number of inversions required to completely dissolve the product was measured.<br>
The results are shown in the table below.<br><br><br><br>
[0049]<br><br>
[Table 1]<br><br>
[0050]<br>
The underground product required more than 15 inversions, whereas grinding enabled the production of granular agrochemical compositions that exhibited good disintegration properties (solubility), with dissolution achieved in not more than 15 inversions.<br><br><br>
[0051]<br><br>
 [Example 4]<br>
Approximately 5 g of each of the wettable powders and water-soluble products listed in Table 2 was placed in a mortar. An amount of pure water prescribed for each<br>
sample was then added to the mortar, and kneading was performed for approximately 5 minutes using a pestle. The kneaded material was placed on a 0.7 mm<t> screen and extruded through the screen by applying pressure from above using the pestle. The thus obtained extruded material was dried for 20 minutes in a fluidized bed dryer (flow coater, model FLO-1, manufactured by Freund Corporation) using an inlet temperature of 50°C, and was then sieved using a sieve of 149 to 1,410 urn (yielding a material equivalent to an unground granular wettable powder or unground water-soluble product).<br>
Subsequently, the back of a spatula was used to crush and grind the material, and the ground material was sieved using a sieve of 149 to 600 um, yielding a series of granular wettable powders and granular water-soluble products.<br><br><br>
[0052] <br><br>
[Test example 2]<br>
The number of inversions required for each of the granular products was measured using the same procedure as test example 1. The results are shown in the table below.<br><br>
[0053]<br><br>
[Table 2]<br><br>
[0054]<br>
The unground products required at least IS inversions, whereas grinding enabled the production of granular agrochemical compositions that exhibited good disintegration properties (solubility), with dissolution achieved in not more than IS inversions.<br><br><br>
[0055]<br><br>
 [Examples]<br>
Approximately 2.S g of each of the wettable powders and water-soluble products listed in Table 3 was placed in a metal container (rice mortar) with an internal diameter of 20 mm, a metal pestle (pounder) was inserted into the container, and a high pressure jack (model 1-313-01, manufactured by AS ONE Corporation) was used to apply a prescribed pressure.<br>
Subsequently, the resulting compressed material was placed in a mortar, ground finely, and then sieved using a sieve of 149 to 1,000 um, thus yielding a granulated wettable powder or granulated water-soluble product.<br><br><br>
[0056] [Test example 3]<br>
The number of inversions required for each of the granular products was measured using the same procedure as test example 1. The results are shown in the table below.<br>
[0057]<br><br>
[0058]<br>
Granular agrochemical compositions that exhibited good disintegration properties (solubility), with dissolution achieved in not more than IS inversions, were able to be produced<br><br><br>
[0059]<br>
The manufacturers of the various products used in the tests are listed below.<br><br><br>
The present invention enables a powdered agrochemical wettable composition or a powdered agrochemical water-soluble composition to be converted only in form to a granular agrochemical composition without altering the formulation thereof. By converting only the form of the powdered agrochemical wettable composition or powdered agrochemical water-soluble composition to a granular agrochemical composition without altering the formulation of the composition, there is no danger of the types of spray nozzle blockages that can occur when a packaged product is diluted. Further, because the obtained granular agrochemical composition does not suffer from dusting, and yet exhibits satisfactory disintegration and suspension properties, it is able to satisfy the requirements for ease of handling and operator safety, and is therefore extremely useful industrially.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
