form of a free carboxylic acid or a free amine. These two forms can be converted from one to the other as desired, and the compound of the present invention can be produced in an intended form. Compound 1, which has a 6-amino-3,5-difluoropyridinyl group at the 1-position, an ethylaminoazetidinyl group at the 7-position and a bromine atom at the 8-position, and its salts obtained as described above, as will be demonstrated in Tests 1-4, have effects unpredictable from the structure-activity correlations accepted to date in connection with the pyridonecarboxylic acid derivatives represented by the formula (I), that is, have a long blood half-life when administered orally, and show an extremely high value of 7 8% in terms of bioavailability as calculated from an AUC up to 24th hour after administration while retaining excellent properties such as extremely good antimicrobial potency and non—exhibition of phototoxicity which is toxicity specific to quinolone.  Further, Compound 1 an its salts also have excellent properties that they are lower in antihypertensive effect and side effects to skin, such as eruption, than known compounds of similar structures. Compound 1 and its salts according to the present invention can each be formulated as an" antimicrobial agent together with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers into compositions for parenteral administration such as injection, rectal administration orinstallation or oral administration in solid or.liquid forms..<br><br><br><br>
Exemplary preparations for injection can include pharmaceutically acceptable, sterile, aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions and emulsions. Illustrative or non-aqueous carriers, diluents, solvents and vehicles are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils, for example, olive oil, and injectable organic esters, for example, ethyl oleate.  Such solutions can also contain additives such as preservatives, moistening agents, emulsifiers and dispersants as needed. These injections can be sterilized, for example, by filtration them through bacterial filters or by adding, immediately before use, sterilizing agents as are or in the form of sterile solid compositions soluble in some other sterile media for injection.<br>
To preparations for instillatory administration, solubilizers, preservatives, isotonicities, thickeners and the like can be added as needed in addition to the compounds according to the present invention.<br>
Exemplary solid preparations for oral administration can include capsules, tablets, pills, powders and granules. Upon formulation of such solid preparations, the compounds according to the present invention are generally mixed with at least one inert extender, for example, sucrose, lactose or starch. In the formulation of ordinary preparations, materials other than • inert extenders, such as lubricants (for example, magnesium stearate), may also be used.  In capsules, tablets and pills,<br><br><br><br>
buffers may be used. To tablets and pills, enteric coatings may be applied.<br>
Exemplary liquid preparations for oral administration can include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs, contain .commonly-employed inert diluents, for example, water.  In addition to such inert diluents, additives such as' wetting agents, emulsifying or suspending agents, sweeteners, seasonings and flavors may also be added.<br>
Preparations for rectal administration can contain, in addition to the compounds according to the present invention, excipients such as cacao butter and suppository wax.<br>
The dosage of each compound of the present invention varies depending upon the properties of the compound, the administration route, the desired treatment period and other factors. In general, however, its daily dosage may preferably range from about 0.1 to 1,000 mg/kg, with a range of from about 0.5 to 100 mg/kg being particularly preferred. Further, this daily dosage can be administered in 2 to 4 portions as desired.<br>

Example 2	<br>
Synthesis of<br>
1- ('6-amino-3, 5-difluoropyridin-2-yl) -8-bromo-7- (3-eth ylaminoazetidin-1-yl)-6-fluoro-4-oxo-l,4-dihydroquino line-3-carboxylic acid maleate (Compound,2) 1-(6-Amino-3,5-difluoropyridin-1-yl)-6-fluoro-4-oxo-l<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
, 4-dihydroquinolinei-3-carboxylic acid (1.38 g) was added to ethanol (13 mL) , and to the mixture, maleic. acid (400 mg) was added gradually. The mixture was heated under stirring at 7'0°C for 5 hours. After the mixture was allowed to cool down, a solid was collected by filtration. The solid was washed with ethanol.. The title compound (1.33 g) was obtained. Appearance: Colorless powder Melting point: 196-199°C<br><br>
1-(6-amino-3, 5-difluoro-pyridin-2-yl) -8-chloro-7- (3-ethylam inoazetidin-1-yl)-6-fluoro-4-oxo-l,4-dihydroquinoline-3-car boxylic'acid.<br>
CPFX: l-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-7-(1-piperadinyl)-1,4-dihydro-4-oxoq uinoline-3-carboxylic acid.<br>
LVFX: S(-)-9-fluoro-2,3-dihydro-3-methyl-10-(4-methyl-l-piperazin yl)-7-oxo-7H-pyrido[1,2, 3-de][1,4]benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid. (1) Antimicrobial effects<br>
Their minimum growth inhibitory concentrations (MICs: jig/mL) were determined in accordance with the standard method of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy [Chemotherapy, 29(1), 7 6 (1981)]. The results are presented in Table 1. .<br><br><br>
Table  1<br><br><br><br>
' (2) Phototoxicity test<br>
A phototoxicity test was performed by the following procedure.<br>
Female ICR mice (5 to 6 weeks old) were intravenously administered with the test compounds (40 mg/kg/10 mL), respectively, and were exposed for 4 hours to ultraviolet rays (320 to 400 ran, 1.8 mW/cm2/sec) . Their ears were observed for abnormality at 0 hour (immediately after the exposure) and after 24 and 48 hours.<br>
Ear abnormality was ranked by the following standards:<br><br>
no abnormality (0 point), mild erythema (1 point), medium erythema (2 points), and severe erythema or edema (3 points). The results are presented in Table 2.<br>
Table 2<br><br>
	0 hour (point,frequency)	24 hours	 48 hours<br>
Compound 1	0, 0/3	0, 0/3	0, 0/3<br>
Comp. Comp'd 1	0, 0/3	0, 0/3	0, 0/3<br>
Comp. Comp'd 2	0.7, 2/3	0, 0/3	0, 0/3<br>
(3) Antibacterial effects on clinically-isolated quinolone resistant pneumococci<br>
Using agar plates added with 5% def ibrinated sheep blood, minimum growth inhibition concentrations (MICs; ug/mL) against certain pneumococci were determined in accordance with the standard method of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy [Chemotherapy, 29(1), 16   (1981)].  The results are presented in Table 3.<br>
Table 3<br><br>
	Compound 1	Comp.Comp'd 1	CPFX	LVFX<br>
Isolated coccus 1	0.03	0.06	 	2<br>
Isolated coccus 5	0.12	0.5	64	32<br><br>
From the results of Table 1 to Table 3, the compound according to the present invention exhibited antimicrobial activities comparable with or better than the comparative compounds, and was also negative in phototoxicity. (4) In  vivo  pharmacokinetic study<br>
An investigation was made on the absorption and excretion of the compounds of the present invention in and from dogs.<br>
A 0.5% suspension of one of the test compounds in methyl cellulose (10 mg/mL/kg) was forcedly administered per os to 2-4 years old, male beagles fasted for 16 to 17 hours. After the administration, blood samples were collected on the 0 .25th, 0 . 5th, 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th and 24th hours, and serumsamples were obtained. To determine urinary excretion rates, urine samples were also collected up to 24th hour after the administration. The concentrations of the test compound in the serum samples and urine samples were measured by the paper disk method making use of Bacillus  subtilis  ATCC6633 as a test bacterium, and the absorption and excretion were ranked. The results so obtained are presented in Table 4.<br><br><br><br>
It has been confirmed from Table 4 that the compounds of the present invention have in  vivo  pharmacokinetic study significantly improved over the comparative compounds.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
Compound 1 and its salts according to the present invention have characteristic properties that, when administered orally, they exhibit long blood half-time and extremely high bioavailability while retaining the properties that they are extremely high in antimicrobial effects and low in toxicity. Compound 1 and its salts also have excellent properties that they are lower in antihypertensive effect and side effects to skin,such as eruption, than known compounds of similar structures. Compound 1 and its salts, therefore, can be used widely as preventives and therapeutics for various infectious diseases of human and animals and also as fish drugs, agrichemicals, food'preservatives and the like.  Further, Compound 1 of the present invention is expected to have antiviral effects, especially anti-HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) effects, and is considered to be effective, for the prevention, or treatment, of AIDS.<br><br><br>
