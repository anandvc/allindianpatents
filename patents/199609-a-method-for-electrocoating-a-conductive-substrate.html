				<td>ELECTRODEPOSITION BATHS CONTAINING CALCIUM SALTS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to improved lead-free eiectrodeposition baths containing a resinous phase dispersed in an aqueous medium, the resinous phase comprised of an ionic electrodepositable resin, a curing agent therefor, and a calcium compound present in a specified amount; and to their use in the method of eiectrodeposition. More particularly, this invention relates to eiectrodeposition baths which provide improved corrosion resistance, especially for untreated steel substrates.<br>
Eiectrodeposition as a coating application method involves deposition of a film-forming composition onto a conductive substrate under the influence of an applied electrical potential. Eiectrodeposition has become increasingly important in the coatings industry because, by comparison with non-electrophoretic coating means, eiectrodeposition offers increased paint utilization, improved corrosion protection and low environmental contamination.<br>
Initially, eiectrodeposition was conducted with the workpiece being coated serving as the anode. This was familiarly referred to as anionic eiectrodeposition. However, in 1972, cationic eiectrodeposition was introduced commercially. Since that time, cationic eiectrodeposition has steadily gained in popularity and today is by far the most prevalent method of eiectrodeposition. Throughout the world, more than 80 percent of all motor vehicles produced are given a primer coating by cationic eiectrodeposition.<br>
Typically, electrodepositable coatings comprise an electrodepositable film-forming polymer and a curing agent, in combination with, inter alia, pigments. Lead-containing pigments such as lead silica chromate, basic lead silicate, lead chromate, and lead sulfate are often used in electrodepositable coatings because they impart excellent corrosion resistance to the electrocoated<br>
article. However, the acid used in cationic electrodeposition baths often solubilizes a portion of the lead pigment forming lead salts which are soluble in the aqueous phase of the electrodeposition bath. These lead salts often find their way into the ultrafiltrate of the bath, thus necessitating the removal and subsequent disposal of metallic lead and/or ionic or organic lead-containing materials.<br>
In recent years, due to environmental concerns, particularly in Europe and Japan, the use of lead-free coatings has been mandated.   Although surface coatings of excellent quality can be achieved by means of cationic electrodeposition of lead-free coatings, the removal of corrosion inhibitive lead pigments can result in poor corrosion resistance of these coatings, particularly when applied to untreated steel substrates.<br>
The use of calcium-containing pigments to improve corrosion resistance of coatings is well known in the art. However, the effectiveness of calcium in the cationic electrodeposition of lead-free coatings is not known. It, therefore, would be advantageous to provide a lead-free electrodeposition bath which provides improved corrosion resistance of the electrocoated metal substrates, especially untreated steel.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a lead-free electrodeposition bath, having improved corrosion resistance, comprising a resinous phase dispersed in an aqueous medium is provided. The resinous phase comprises the following components:<br>
(a)	an active hydrogen-group containing ionic electrodepositable resin, and<br>
(b)	a curing agent having functional groups reactive with the active hydrogen groups of (a).<br>
The improvement comprises the inclusion in the electrodeposition bath of a calcium compound present in an amount from about 10 to about 10,000<br>
parts per million of total calcium and not more than about 200 parts per million soluble calcium, based on electrodeposition bath weight.<br>
Also provided is a method of electrocoating a conductive substrate serving as a charged electrode in an electrical circuit comprising the electrode and an oppositely charged counter electrode which are immersed in an aqueous electrodeposition bath described above, and metallic substrates coated by the method.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Generally, the electrodeposition bath of the present invention comprises a resinous phase dispersed in an aqueous medium wherein the resinous phase comprises the following components:<br>
(a)	an active hydrogen group-containing ionic electrodepositable resin, and<br>
(b)	a curing agent having functional groups reactive with the active hydrogen groups of (a), wherein the improvement comprises a lead-free electrodeposition bath containing at least one calcium compound present in an amount from about 10 to about 10,000 parts per million, preferably not more than about 5,000 parts per million, and more preferably not more than about 1,000 parts per million, of total calcium, and not more than about 200 parts per million, preferably not more than about 75 parts per million, and more preferably not more than 50 parts per million soluble calcium, based on electrodeposition bath weight.<br>
At levels lower than 10 parts per million total calcium, based on electrodeposition bath weight, no appreciable improvement in corrosion resistance of the electrocoated substrate is observed.   At levels of higher than about 200 parts per million soluble calcium, based on electrodeposition bath weight, appearance of the electrocoated substrate is unacceptable due to surface roughness believed to be the result of pinholing caused by gas evolution at the cathode.<br>
By "total calcium" is meant the total amount of non-dissociated calcium present in the form of soluble and/or insoluble calcium compounds. By "soluble calcium" is meant calcium ion, that is Ca+2, resulting from the<br>
dissociation of the calcium compound in the aqueous electrodeposition bath. By "soluble calcium compound" is meant a calcium compound capable of ' substantially complete dissociation in aqueous media, and by "insoluble calcium compound" is meant a calcium compound capable of only partial dissociation in aqueous media.<br>
Examples of soluble calcium compounds suitable for use in the lead-free electrodeposition bath of the present invention are organic and inorganic calcium salts such as calcium acetate, calcium chloride, calcium formate, and calcium nitrate.   Calcium acetate is the preferred soluble calcium compound. Examples of insoluble calcium compounds suitable for use in the electrodeposition baths of the present invention are organic and inorganic calcium salts such as calcium oxalate, calcium molybdate, calcium titanate and calcium fluorosilicate. Calcium oxalate is the preferred insoluble calcium compound. Calcium can also be present in the form of a calcium pigment such as calcium carbonate.<br>
Besides the aforementioned calcium compounds and pigments, the electrodeposition baths of the present invention also contain, as a main film-forming polymer, an active hydrogen-containing ionic, preferably cationic, electrodepositable resin. A wide variety of electrodepositable film-forming polymers are known and can be used in the electrodeposition baths of the invention so long as the polymers are "water dispersible," i.e., adapted to be solubilized, dispersed or emulsified in water. The water dispersible polymer is ionic in nature, that is, the polymer will contain anionic functional groups to impart a negative charge or, as is preferred, cationic functional groups to impart a positive charge.<br>
Examples of film-forming resins suitable for use in anionic electrodeposition bath compositions are base-solubilized, carboxylic acid containing polymers such as the reaction product or adduct of a drying oil or semi-drying fatty acid ester with a dicarboxylic acid or anhydride; and the reaction product of a fatty acid ester, unsaturated acid or anhydride and any additional<br>
unsaturated modifying materials which are further reacted with polyol. Also suitable are the at least partially neutralized interpolymers of hydroxy-alkyl esters of unsaturated carboxylic acids, unsaturated carboxylic acid and at least one other ethylenically unsaturated monomer. Still another suitable electrodepositable resin comprises an alkyd-aminoplast vehicle, i.e., a vehicle containing an alkyd resin and an amine-aldehyde resin. Yet another anionic electrodepositable resin composition comprises mixed esters of a resinous polyol. These compositions are described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 3,749,657 at col. 9, lines 1 to 75 and col. 10, lines 1 to 13, all of which are herein incorporated by reference. Other acid functional polymers can also be used such as phosphatized polyepoxide or phosphatized acrylic polymers as are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
As aforementioned, it is preferred that the active hydrogen-containing ionic electrodepositable resin (a) is cationic and capable of deposition on a cathode. Examples of such cationic film-forming resins include amine salt group-containing resins such as the acid-solubilized reaction products of polyepoxides and primary or secondary amines such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,663,389; 3,984,299; 3,947,338; and 3,947,339. Usually, these amine salt group-containing resins are used in combination with a blocked isocyanate curing agent. The isocyanate can be fully blocked as described in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 3,984,299 or the isocyanate can be partially blocked and reacted with the resin backbone such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,947,338. Also, one-component compositions as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,134,866 and DE-OS No. 2,707,405 can be used as the film-forming resin. Besides the epoxy-amine reaction products, film-forming resins can also be selected from cationic acrylic resins such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,455,806 and 3,928,157.<br>
Besides amine salt group-containing resins, quaternary ammonium salt group-containing resins can also be employed. Examples of these resins are those which are formed from reacting an organic polyepoxide with a tertiary amine salt. Such resins are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,962,165; 3,975,346; and 4,001,101. Examples of other cationic resins are ternary sulfonium salt group-<br>
containing resins and quaternary phosphonium salt-group containing resins such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,793,278 and 3,984,922, respectively. Also, film-forming resins which cure via transesterification such as described in European Application No. 12463 can be used. Further, cationic compositions prepared from Mannich bases such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,134,932 can be used.<br>
The resins to which the present invention is particularly effective are those positively charged resins which contain primary and/or secondary amine groups. Such resins are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,663,389; 3,947,339; and 4,116,900. In U.S. Pat. No. 3,947,339, a polyketimine derivative of a polyamine such as diethylenetriamine or triethylenetetraamine is reacted with a polyepoxide. When the reaction product is neutralized with acid and dispersed in water, free primary amine groups are generated. Also, equivalent products are formed when polyepoxide is reacted with excess polyamines such as diethylenetriamine and triethylenetetraamine and the excess polyamine vacuum stripped from the reaction mixture. Such products are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,663,389 and 4,116,900.<br>
The active hydrogen-containing ionic electrodepositable resin described above is present in the electrodeposition bath of the invention in amounts of about 1 to about 60 percent by weight, preferably about 5 to about 25 based on total weight of the electrodeposition bath.<br>
The resinous phase of the electrodeposition bath of the present invention further comprises (b) a curing agent adapted to react with the active hydrogen groups of the ionic electrodepositable resin (a) described immediately above.   Both blocked organic polyisocyanate and aminoplast curing agents are suitable for use in the present invention, although blocked isocyanates are preferred herein for cathodic electrodeposition.<br>
Aminoplast resins, which are the preferred curing agent for anionic electrodeposition, are the condensation products of amines or amides with aldehydes. Examples of suitable amine or amides are melamine, benzoguanamine, urea and similar compounds. Generally, the aldehyde employed<br>
is formaldehyde, although products can be made from other aldehydes such as acetaldehyde and furfural. The condensation products contain methylol groups or similar alkylol groups depending on the particular aldehyde employed. Preferably, these methylol groups are etherified by reaction with an alcohol. Various alcohols employed include monohydric alcohols containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and n-butanol, with methanol being preferred. Aminoplast resins are commercially available from American Cyanamid Co. under the trademark CYMEL and from Monsanto Chemical Co. under the trademark RESIMENE.<br>
The aminoplast curing agents are typically utilized in conjunction with the active hydrogen containing anionic electrodepositable resin in amounts ranging from about 5 percent to about 60 percent by weight, preferably from about 20 percent to about 40 percent by weight, the percentages based on the total weight of the resin solids in the electrodeposition bath.<br>
The preferred curing agents for use in cathodic electrodeposition are blocked organic polyisocyanates. The polyisocyanates can be fully blocked as described in U. S. Patent No. 3,984,299 column 1 lines 1 to 68, column 2 and column 3 lines 1 to 15, or partially blocked and reacted with the polymer backbone as described in U. S. Patent No. 3,947,338 column 2 lines 65 to 68, column 3 and column 4 lines 1 to 30, which are incorporated by reference herein. By "blocked" is meant that the isocyanate groups have been reacted with a compound so that the resultant blocked isocyanate group is stable to active hydrogens at ambient temperature but reactive with active hydrogens in the film forming polymer at elevated temperatures usually between 90°C and 200°C.<br>
Suitable polyisocyanates include aromatic and aliphatic polyisocyanates, including cycloaliphatic polyisocyanates and representative examples include diphenylmethane-4,4'-diisocyanate (MDI), 2,4- or 2,6-toluene diisocyanate (TDI), including mixtures thereof, p-phenylene diisocyanate, tetramethylene and hexamethylene diisocyanates, dicyclohexylmethane-4,4'-diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, mixtures of phenylmethane-4,4'-<br>
diisocyanate and polymethylene polyphenylisocyanate. Higher polyisocyanates such as triisocyanates can be used. An example would include triphenylmethane-4,4',4"-triisocyanate. Isocyanate ()-prepolymers with polyols such as neopentyl glycol and trimethylolpropane and with polymeric polyols such as polycaprolactone diols and triols (NCO/OH equivalent ratio greater than 1) can also be used.<br>
The polyisocyanate curing agents are typically utilized in conjunction with the active hydrogen containing cationic electrodepositabie resin in amounts ranging from about 5 percent to about 60 percent by weight, preferably from about 20 percent to about 50 percent by weight, the percentages based on the total weight of the resin solids of the electrodeposition bath.<br>
The aqueous compositions of the present invention are in the form of an aqueous dispersion. The term "dispersion" is believed to be a two-phase transparent, translucent or opaque resinous system in which the resin is in the dispersed phase and the water is in the continuous phase. The average particle size of the resinous phase is generally less than 1.0 and usually less than 0.5 microns, preferably less than 0.15 micron.<br>
The concentration of the resinous phase in the aqueous medium is at least 1 and usually from about 2 to about 60 percent by weight based on total weight of the aqueous dispersion. When the compositions of the present invention are in the form of resin concentrates, they generally have a resin solids content of about 20 to about 60 percent by weight based on weight of the aqueous dispersion.<br>
Electrodeposition baths of the invention are typically supplied as two components: (1) a clear resin feed, which includes generally the active hydrogen-containing ionic electrodepositabie resin, i.e., the main film-forming polymer, the curing agent, and any additional water-dispersible, non-pigmented components; and (2) a pigment paste, which generally includes one or more pigments, a water-dispersible grind resin which can be the same or different from the main-film forming polymer, and, optionally, additives such as wetting or<br>
dispersing aids. Electrodeposition bath components (1) and (2) are dispersed in an aqueous medium which comprises water and, usually, coalescing solvents.<br>
It should be appreciated that there are various methods by which the calcium compound can be incorporated into the electrodeposition bath. The soluble calcium compound may be added "neat," that is, added directly to the bath without prior blending or reacting with other components. Alternatively, the soluble calcium compound can be added to the predispersed clear resin feed which may include the ionic resin, the curing agent and/or any other non-pigmented component. Preferably, the soluble calcium compound is added "neat" to the electrodeposition bath. The insoluble calcium compound and/or calcium pigments, on the other hand, are pre-blended with the pigment paste component prior to the incorporation of the paste to the electrodeposition bath.<br>
The electrodeposition bath of the present invention has a resin solids content usually within the range of about 5 to 25 percent by weight based on total weight of the electrodeposition bath.<br>
As aforementioned, besides water, the aqueous medium may contain a coalescing solvent. Useful coalescing solvents include hydrocarbons, alcohols, esters, ethers and ketones. The preferred coalescing solvents include alcohols, polyols and ketones. Specific coalescing solvents include isopropanol, butanol, 2-ethylhexanol, isophorone, 2-methoxypentanone, ethylene and propylene glycol and the monoethyl, monobutyl and monohexyl ethers of ethylene glycol. The amount of coalescing solvent is generally between about 0.01 and 25 percent and when used, preferably from about 0.05 to about 5 percent by weight based on total weight of the aqueous medium.<br>
As discussed above, a pigment composition and, if desired, various additives such as surfactants, wetting agents or catalyst can be included in the dispersion. The pigment composition may be of the conventional type comprising pigments, for example, iron oxides, strontium chromate, carbon black, coal dust, titanium dioxide, talc, barium sulfate, as well as color pigments such as cadmium yellow, cadmium red, chromium yellow and the like. The pigment content of the<br>
dispersion is usually expressed as a pigment-to-resin ratio. In the practice of the invention, when pigment is employed, the pigment-to-resin ratio is usually within the range of about 0.02 to 1:1. The other additives mentioned above are usually in the dispersion in amounts of about 0.01 to 3 percent by weight based on weight of resin solids.<br>
The electrodepositable coating compositions of the present<br>
invention can be applied by electrodeposition to a variety of electroconductive<br>
substrates especially metals such as untreated steel, galvanized steel, aluminum,<br>
copper, magnesium and conductive carbon coated materials. The applied voltage<br>
for electrodeposition may be varied and can be, for example, as low as 1 volt to as<br>
high as several thousand volts, but typically between 50 and 500 volts. The<br>
current density is usually between 0.5 ampere and 5 amperes per square foot and<br>
tends to decrease during electrodeposition indicating the formation of an<br>
insulating film.	i<br>
After the coating has been applied by electrodeposition, it is cured usually by baking at elevated temperatures such as about 90° to about 260°C. for about 1 to about 40 minutes.<br>

The following Comparative Examples 6 through 8 describe the preparation of electrodeposition bath compositions of the invention containing, respectively, 200, 400, and 600 parts per million of soluble calcium derived from the soluble calcium solution of Example EE. The electrodeposition bath compositions were prepared from a mixture of the following ingredients:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
ELECTRODEPOSITION BATH PREPARATION:<br>
Under agitation, the cationic resin of Example B was diluted with approximately 15% of the total deionized water. The diluted resin was then stirred into the cationic resin of Example A. The flexibilizer resin was separately diluted<br><br>
with the solvent under agitation, then further diluted with about 30% of the total deionized water before adding to the cationic resin blend. The flow control additive was then added. The pigment paste was separately diluted with the remaining deionized water and added to the above resin blend. After two hours of agitation, the bath premix was further diluted with deionized water and the calcium acetate solution was then added. Final bath solids are about 22%, with a pigment to resin ratio of 0.17:1.0. The test baths were 15% ultrafiltered and replenished with fresh deionized water before electrocoating.<br>
ELECTROCOATING PROCEDURE:<br>
Each of the electrodeposition bath compositions of Examples 1 through 8 above were electrodeposited onto non-phosphated cold rolled steel panels, commercially available from ACT Laboratories. Conditions for cationic electrodeposition of each were as follows: 2 minutes at 90°F. at 170-180 volts to yield a cured film thickness of 0.6 to 0.8 mils. The coated substrate was cured in an electric oven at 340°F. for 20 minutes.<br>
TESTING PROCEDURE:<br>
Each of the coated untreated steel test panels was scribed, cutting through the coating to the metal, in an "X" pattern. The test panels were then subjected to salt spray testing in accordance with ASTM Bl 17. Test panels were evaluated for "scribe creep" corrosion and visual appearance. Scribe creep is reported as average distance (in millimeters) of corrosion from the scribe mark. Appearance was visually rated for surface roughness and pinholing in the coating surface. Test results are reported in the following TABLE 1.<br>
