				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to acetoacetic acid arylide type disazo pigments<br>
and to pigment dispersions thereof. More specifically, the present invention relates to<br>
an acetoacetic acid arylide disazo type pigment and to a pigment dispersion, which is<br>
useful in various applications, including coloring materials such as ink, paint, plastic,<br>
color toner, and color filter.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
C.I. Pigment Yellow 180 including 2,2'-[l, 2-ethanediyl-bis(oxy 2,1-<br>
phenyleneazo)] bis [N-(2,3-dihydro-2-oxo-lH-benzimidazole-5-yl)-3-oxo-<br>
butaneamide (hereinafter referred to as a basic substance) is known as a useful yellow<br>
colorant, and has been used for various purposes. The basic substance can be<br>
obtained by a diazocoupling reaction, and since it has the structure derived from one of<br>
the raw materials, i.e., a benzimidazolone compound, the pigment has significantly<br>
high light fastness, improved overcoating fastness when applied to paint, and improved<br>
migration fastness and high thermostability as applied to a synthetic resin. The term<br>
"pigment", in contrast with the definition of a dye, means, in its broader application,<br>
fine powder which does not dissolve or is insoluble in water or organic solvent. This<br>
also applies to the above basic substance. In the present invention, in accordance<br>
with the above definition, a crude pigment, which will be described later, is also<br>
included in pigments.<br>
Also, since l,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane, not dichlorobenzidines which<br>
are mutagenic, is used as the raw material for a bisdiazonium salt, which is the other<br>
substance used for the diazocoupling reaction, in the production of the basic substance,<br>
C.I. Pigment Yellow 180 is one of the few yellow colorant among acetoacetic acid<br>
arylid disazo type agents that can be used for, for instance, a preparation for<br>
electrostatic image developing toner, to which "Blauer Engel" (long title: "Das<br>
Umweltzeichen" meaning "environmental protection label", a German ecological<br>
mark) certified by the German Confederation Environment Agency and operated by<br>
German Quality Assurance Label Association, is issued.<br><br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. Sho 56-<br>
38354, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. Hei 8-209017,<br>
and Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. Hei 8-295815<br>
disclose C.I. Pigment Yellow 180 containing the above basic substance.<br>
Despite the above-mentioned broad definition of pigment, all of the<br>
conventional manufacturing methods for C.I. Pigment Yellow 180 described in these<br>
publications include a first process in which a bisdiazonium salt of l,2-bis(2-<br>
aminophenoxy) ethane is coupled with 5-acetoacetylamino-benzimidazolone to obtain<br>
crude pigment, and a subsequent second process in which the crude pigment obtained<br>
in the first process is filtered and added to a liquid medium containing organic solvent<br>
as an essential component. Then, the liquid medium is subjected to a heat process<br>
and a colorant is produced.<br>
Note that in this field of industry, the above-mentioned "crude pigment" has<br>
the same meaning as "prepigment" and "crude". Likewise, the above-mentioned<br>
second process is also referred to as an aftertreating process, a finishing process, a<br>
conditioning process, or a pigmentization process. All of these terms have the same<br>
meaning.<br>
On the other hand, the BET specific surface area based on the nitrogen<br>
absorption method, and the strength of each diffraction peak of a crystal based on<br>
Bragg angles measured by using CuK  characteristic X-ray are examples showing<br>
important physical characteristics of pigment. These characteristics, together with the<br>
particle size of the pigment, are often used as indices for estimating characteristics of<br>
the pigment, such as the readiness of being dispersed in a dispersion medium, for<br>
example, vehicle, and the flow properties of a colored dispersion medium obtained.<br>
In C.I. pigment Yellow 180 including the above mentioned basic substance,<br>
the particle size of the pigment affects various properties of a dispersion medium<br>
colored by using the colorant, such as brightness, transparency, color strength, hue, and<br>
flow properties, in the application of printing ink, for example. As for the pigment<br>
which has been subjected to the above second process, the smaller the particle size of<br>
primary particle thereof, the more its brightness, transparency, and color strength tend<br>
to increase. The reason for this is because, in the pigment whose degree of<br>
aggregation among particles is smaller (or weaker) than that of a crude pigment, which<br>
will be described later, the dispersibility of the primary particle thereof in a dispersion<br><br>
medium to be colored is better. In such a pigment, aggregation of the particles hardly<br>
occurs and they can be dispersed in a dispersion medium to be colored in a primary<br>
particle level. The measured specific surface area of such pigment having excellent<br>
brightness is larger than that of a crude pigment. That is, as for pigment which is<br>
subjected to the above second process, there is a tendency that the smaller the particle<br>
size of the primary particle of pigment, the larger the specific surface area thereof.<br>
On the other hand, conventional crude pigments including the above basic<br>
substance corresponding to C.I. pigment Yellow 180 have lower crystallinity in the<br>
primary particle level and smaller particle size than the pigment which is subjected to<br>
the second process. Since the primary particles thereof are smaller as compared with<br>
the pigment subjected to the second process, the surface energy of the crude pigment is<br>
significantly higher, and as a result, the aggregation among the primary particles tends<br>
to increase in the crude pigment. Such a strong aggregation of the crude pigment<br>
cannot be decreased by using mechanical shearing strength. The specific surface area<br>
of such a crude pigment measured in the same manner as the pigment subjected to the<br>
second process, is smaller than that of a corresponding pigment. Moreover, if the<br>
crude pigment is directly used as a colorant, since the dispersibility thereof in a<br>
dispersion medium is insufficient, it is not useful in practice due to such factors as<br>
dullness. These are the conventional prevailing views as to the relationships between<br>
the physical characteristics of the crude pigment including the above basic substance<br>
and its practical applications.<br>
Note that although it is possible to classify the above basic substance into<br>
crude pigment, which is not subjected to the second process, and pigment, which is<br>
subjected to both the first and the second processes, in the classification based on the<br>
manufacturing process as mentioned above, the basic substance is a pigment although<br>
it is subjected only to the first process, in the classification based on whether to satisfy<br>
various characteristics required for a colorant, regardless of the classification based on<br>
the manufacturing process, if it satisfies such characteristics required for a colorant.<br>
However, such a basic substance has not been obtained before the present invention.<br>
As in the above conventional prevailing view, the basic substance obtained<br>
by the conventional methods described in the above publications is in a strong<br>
aggregated state, and the specific surface area thereof is 10 m2/g or less.<br><br>
A powder X-ray diffraction diagram is a graph in which the strength of X-ray<br>
diffraction of a sample at each Bragg angle, when the Bragg angle is continuously<br>
changed, is consecutively plotted based on zero of the diffraction strength. The<br>
absolute strength of the X-ray diffraction at each Bragg angle can be determined based<br>
on zero of the diffraction strength in the powder X-ray diffraction diagram.<br>
The inventors of the present invention paid attention to this point, and newly<br>
adopted, as a standard for clearly distinguishing a crude pigment, which is not<br>
subjected to the above second process in the classification based on the manufacturing<br>
process, from pigment, which is subjected to the above second process, the ratio of the<br>
absolute strength of the X-ray diffraction at a Bragg angle 2  = 17.5° ± 0.2° with<br>
respect to that at 2  = 18.2° ± 0.2°. The inventors of the present invention now<br>
found that if a colored dispersion medium is prepared from a crude pigment, which is<br>
based on the classification of a manufacturing process, including the above<br>
conventional basic substance having the ratio of the absolute strength of 
color strength and brightness are not satisfactory and is not suitable for use as a<br>
colorant.<br>
For the reasons mentioned above, the crude pigment, which is classified based<br>
on the manufacturing process, including the basic substance is not conventionally used<br>
directly as a colorant, and is further subjected to the second process mentioned above<br>
in order to grow crystals of the primary particles to increase the particle size. In this<br>
manner, the aggregation of particles may be loosened and pigment having required<br>
brightness and color strength is obtained. Also, the flow properties of a colored<br>
dispersion medium are improved. These are all described in the above-mentioned<br>
publications.<br>
In the conventional technique relating to the above basic substance, since<br>
certain properties required for a colorant can be obtained via the second process as<br>
mentioned above, there is no positive motivation in this field to develop a crude<br>
pigment, in the classification based on the manufacturing process, which is suitable for<br>
application as a colorant. Since the development as a colorant has relied upon the<br>
factors in the second process mentioned above, studies have not been made of the use<br>
of a crude pigment, in the classification based on the manufacturing process, directly<br>
as a colorant.<br>
In addition, in the above-mentioned second process, the aggregation of<br><br>
particles is weakened by growing each particle to increase the particle size of the<br>
primary particle. However, when high levels of transparency or color strength is<br>
required for an objective application, the inherent small particle size of a crude<br>
pigment, in the classification based on the manufacturing process, has an advantage in<br>
terms of its transparency. Nevertheless, the particle size of the primary particle is<br>
increased in exchanged for weakening the cohesive strength in the second process, and<br>
this makes it difficult to obtain expected properties as a colorant.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The inventors of the present invention thought that if the above basic<br>
substance is obtained in a weak aggregated state, its specific surface area increases.<br>
As a result, the aggregation may be readily loosened by using weaker force to improve<br>
its dispersibility, and hence, brightness, etc. If this could be performed, the basic<br>
substance, although a crude pigment in the classification based on the manufacturing<br>
process, would have characteristics as a colorant.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a yellow<br>
pigment which can be dispersed using a weak force and can be directly used for<br>
applications in which properties, such as brightness and color strength, are important.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a yellow pigment which maintains<br>
weak aggregated state immediately after a coupling process and includes loosened or<br>
easily loosened particle groups.<br>
Also, yet another object of the present invention is to provide a method for<br>
manufacturing a yellow pigment having excellent characteristics mentioned above<br>
without even carrying out the second process, which is conventionally used for<br>
imparting suitable properties as a colorant to the pigment, so that the productivity per<br>
unit time of the colorant is improved.<br>
The inventors of the present invention, by fundamental studies on obtaining<br>
the above basic substance, which has a weak aggregation state, found that if the basic<br>
substance having the specific surface area of 20 m2/g or more is obtained in the above<br>
first process, the aggregation state thereof becomes weak, and hence, the color strength<br>
and the transparency of a dispersion medium colored by the basic substance having the<br>
weak aggregation state are improved even though it should be called a crude pigment<br>
in classification based on the manufacturing process.<br><br>
Also, the inventors of the present invention found that the above basic<br>
substance satisfying the condition that the specific surface area and the absolute<br>
strength ratio of the X-ray diffraction between two specific Bragg angles are within a<br>
specific range, regardless of whether it is classiiied as pigment or crude pigment in<br>
terms of its manufacturing process (i.e., if the above basic substance is prepared via<br>
only the first process or both the first process and the second process), and regardless<br>
of the classification based on whether it satisfies characteristics required as a colorant<br>
(i.e., one which satisfies the characteristics required for a colorant is called a pigment,<br>
and one which does not is not called a pigment), has an excellent color strength and<br>
transparency and can be called a pigment. The color strength and transparency of a<br>
dispersion medium largely changes by the difference in the absolute strength ratio of<br>
the basic substance dispersed therein even if the specific surface area thereof is the<br>
same.<br>
Moreover, the inventors of the present invention found that the number of<br>
steps in the manufacturing process of the above basic substance having the excellent<br>
properties may be reduced and the productivity thereof per unit time may be improved<br>
since the basic substance, which can be directly applied as a colorant, may be produced<br>
via only the above first process without the second process.<br>
In addition, the inventors of the present invention found that the pigment<br>
actually obtained via only the first process having the specific surface area of 20 m2/g<br>
or greater and a certain range of the absolute strength ratio of the X-ray diffraction<br>
between two specific Bragg angles has an excellent color strength and transparency,<br>
though smaller in the specific surface area, in comparison with pigment, which is<br>
obtained via both the first and the second processes as disclosed in the above-<br>
mentioned publications and has the specific surface area of 45 m2/g or greater, under<br>
the condition of using the same dispersion medium with the same percentage content.<br>
Based on these findings, the inventors of the present invention completed the present<br>
invention.<br>
That is, an object of the present invention is to provide a pigment including a<br>
chemical compound expressed by the following formula (1), wherein the pigment has<br>
the BET specific surface area based on the nitrogen absorption process of 2-100 m2/g,<br>
and the ratio of the absolute strength of X-ray diffraction at Bragg angle 2 = 17.5°<br>
± 0.2° to the absolute strength of X-ray diffraction at Bragg angle 2 =18.2° ±<br><br>
0.2° of the pigment in a powder X-ray diffraction diagram using a CuK <br>
characteristic X-ray is smaller than 1.8/1.0.<br><br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, the above<br>
pigment further includes a surface treatment agent, the amount of the surface treatment<br>
agent corresponding to 0.1 to 50% by weight of the pigment.<br>
In yet another aspect of the present invention, the pigment is used for<br>
coloring printing ink, paint, or plastic.<br>
In yet another aspect of the present invention, the pigment is used for<br>
coloring toners, or color filters.<br>
According to the pigment described above, since it comprises the above basic<br>
substance having the BET specific surface area based on the nitrogen absorption<br>
method of 20-100 m2/g and the ratio of the absolute strength of the X-ray diffraction<br>
between Bragg angles 2  = 17.5° ± 0.2° and 2 9 = 18.2° ± 0.2° smaller than<br>
1.8/1.0, it has a remarkable effect in that it can be used as a colorant having excellent<br>
transparency and color strength in comparison with conventional pigments having the<br>
absolute strength ratio outside the above range. Also, since no aftertreating process<br>
for pigmentization is required for the pigment according to the present invention, the<br>
number of steps necessary in the manufacturing process can be reduced and the<br>
productivity thereof as pigment can be improved. Moreover, the pigment according<br>
to the present invention has a superior effect in that it can be used, although crude<br>
pigment in the classification based on the manufacturing process, as pigment having<br>
better transparency and color strength as compared with pigment subjected to the<br>
aftertreating process. In addition, since the pigment dispersion according to the<br><br>
present invention includes the pigment of the present invention having a weaker<br>
aggregated state as compared with that of conventional pigments, it has a remarkable<br>
effect of providing excellent transparency and color strength.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for manufacturing the above<br>
pigment including the step of simultaneously dropping a bisdiazonium salt of 1,2-<br>
bis(2-aminophenoxy) ethane and 5-acetoacetylamino-benzimidazolone into an aqueous<br>
solution of pH 4-8 to carry out a coupling reaction.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for manufacturing the above<br>
pigment including the steps of simultaneously dropping a bisdiazonium salt of 1,2-<br>
bis(2-aminophenoxy) ethane and 5-acetoacetylamino-benzimidazolone into an aqueous<br>
solution of pH 4-8 to carry out a coupling reaction, increasing the pH of the solution to<br>
be higher than the pH of the solution at the completion of the coupling reaction, and<br>
heating the solution to a temperature of 60-95°C.<br>
The present invention also provides a pigment dispersion including the above<br>
pigment, and a thermoplastic resin, wherein 0.5-100 parts by weight of the pigment is<br>
dispersed in 100 parts by weight of the thermoplastic resin.<br>
In yet another aspect of the present invention, the above pigment dispersion<br>
is obtained by a method including a step of flushing the above pigment including water<br>
with the thermoplastic resin.<br>

powder toner comprising the above pigment dispersion<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention summarized above and defined by the enumerated claims may<br>
be better understood by referring to the following detailed description. This detailed<br>
description of particular preferred embodiments, set out below to enable one to build<br>
and use one particular implementation of the invention, is not intended to limit the<br>
enumerated claims, but to serve as a particular example thereof.<br>
First, pigment according to an embodiment of the present invention will be<br>
explained. The pigment according to an embodiment of the present invention<br>
includes 2,2'-[l, 2-ethanediylbis(oxy 2,1-phenyleneazo)] bis[N-(2,3-dihydro-2-oxo-<br>
lH-benzirnidazole-5-yl)-3-oxo-butaneamide, which is the above-mentioned basic<br>
substance. That is, in terms of chemical composition, this is the same as C.I. Pigment<br>
Yellow 180.<br>
The pigment according to an embodiment of the present invention is defined<br>
by the BET specific surface area based on the nitrogen absorption process, and the<br>
absolute strength ratio of X-ray diffraction at two specific Bragg angles in a powder X-<br>
ray diffraction diagram using a CuK  characteristic X-ray.<br>
The pigment according to an embodiment of the present invention can be<br>
distinguished from conventional crude pigment in terms of its large specific surface<br>
area derived from its weak aggregated state. In addition, the pigment according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention can be distinguished from conventional crude<br>
pigment in terms of its absolute strength ratio (h1 /h2) being smaller than 1.8/1.0. As<br>
mentioned above, the absolute strength ratio (hl/h2) means the ratio of the absolute<br><br>
strength (h1) of X-ray diffraction at Bragg angle 2  = 17.5° ± 0.2° to the absolute<br>
strength (h2) of X-ray diffraction at Bragg angle 2 =18.2° ± 0.2° in the powder X-<br>
ray diffraction diagram using the CuK  characteristic X-ray.<br>
The BET specific surface area based on the nitrogen absorption process used<br>
in the present invention is measured in accordance with JIS Z 8830-1990 (i.e., a<br>
specific surface area measuring method for powder using gas adsorption process).<br>
The conditions used for the measurement described in the accompanying document 2<br>
of JIS are: pretreatment of sample; temperature of 120°C for 20 minutes; sample<br>
weight of 0.25g; measuring method for adsorption amount of one point method; and<br>
nitrogen partial pressure of 0.3. Micro sorp 4232 II (a product of Micro-Data Co.,<br>
Ltd.) is a specific surface area measuring device which conforms with the conditions.<br>
The BET specific surface area based on the nitrogen absorption process of<br>
the pigment according to an embodiment of the present invention is in a range between<br>
about 20-100 m2/g, preferably in a range between about 30-85 m2/g.<br>
The measurement of the X-ray diffraction strength in the present invention is<br>
carried out in accordance with JIS K 0131-1996, which defines the general X-ray<br>
diffraction analysis rules, and is obtained from a powder X-ray diffraction diagram in<br>
which X-ray diffraction peaks are recorded using CuK  characteristic X-ray (i.e.,<br>
wavelength of 0.1541 nanometer).<br>
The term "absolute strength of X-ray diffraction" expresses the strength of X-<br>
ray diffraction of a matter at an arbitrary Bragg angle when the Bragg angle is<br>
continuously changed based on zero of the diffraction strength in a powder X-ray<br>
diffraction diagram.<br>
In the powder X-ray diffraction diagram, the half-width of a diffraction peak<br>
of a crude pigment tends to increase, more or less, as compared with that of a pigment,<br>
in comparison with the diffraction peak generated at the same Bragg angle, since the<br>
crystallinity of a conventional crude pigment is lower than that of a pigment.<br>
The inventors of the present invention found the Bragg angles at which the<br>
same tendency as mentioned above appears for the above basic substance is most<br>
conspicuous. More specifically, although a diffraction peak generated at Bragg angle<br>
2 = 17.5° ± 0.2° and an adjacent diffraction peak generated at 2  = 19.3° ±0.2°<br>
can be distinguished as two completely separated peaks in a conventional pigment<br>
including the above basic substance, the base portions of the corresponding two peaks<br><br>
are superimposed and cannot be clearly distinguished in the pigment according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. That is, in the pigment according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention, since the base portion at the higher angle side of<br>
the diffraction peak at Bragg angle 2 =17.5° ± 0.2° and the base portion at the<br>
lower angle side of the adjacent diffraction peak at 2  = 19.3° ± 0.2° are<br>
superimposed and form a trough of the absolute strength. In the X-ray diffraction<br>
diagram of the above mentioned basic substance, the bottom portion of the trough<br>
appears at Bragg angle 2 = 18.2°± 0.2° and it has a specific absolute strength in the<br>
X-ray diffraction (refer to diagrams).<br>
The inventors of the present invention, in considerations of the above<br>
observation, adapted the ratio (hl/h2) of the absolute strength (h1) of X-ray diffraction<br>
at Bragg angle 2 = 17.5° ± 0.2° to the absolute strength (h2) at 2  = 18.2° ± 0.2°<br>
as a criterion for distinguishing crude pigment from pigment as to classification based<br>
on manufacturing process and also as a criterion for distinguishing crude pigment from<br>
pigment as to classification based on the degree of satisfying properties required as a<br>
colorant. In the pigment according to an embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
ratio (hl/h2) of the absolute strength (h1) at Bragg angle 2 = 17.5° ± 0.2° and the<br>
absolute strength (h2) at Bragg angle 2  = 18.2° ± 0.2° of X-ray diffraction is 
1.8/1.0.<br>
The aggregation strength of pigment according to the present invention, in its<br>
powdered state, is considerably less than that of a conventional crude pigment, and<br>
hence, has a characteristic in that it can be separated by weaker force. As a result,<br>
neither an aftertreating process nor a pigmentization process (i.e., the above-mentioned<br>
second process), which is usually carried out in order to readily separate the<br>
aggregation of a crude pigment, is not necessary for the pigment according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Thus, although it is a crude pigment in terms of<br>
its manufacturing process, the pigment according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention can be suitably used as a pigment.<br>
The pigment according to the present invention explained above can be<br>
prepared by using a method in which fine particles are obtained immediately after a<br>
coupling process is maintained in a weak aggregated state. More specifically, as an<br>
example of the method for manufacturing pigment according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention having a structure in which bisdiazonium salt of 1,2-bis(2-<br><br>
aminophenoxy) ethane (hereinafter referred to as a bisdiazonium salt) is used as a<br>
diazo component and 5-acetoacetylamino-benzimidazolone (hereinafter referred to as<br>
an imidazolone compound) is used as a coupler component and both are subjected to a<br>
coupling process, one in which the bisdiazonium salt and the imidazolone compound<br>
are simultaneously dropped into an aqueous solution having pH of 4-8 to carry out a<br>
coupling reaction is included.<br>
In this coupling reaction, 1, 2-bis(2-aminophenoxy) ethane, which is a raw<br>
material, is usually converted to a bisdiazonium salt solution in advance, and then the<br>
reaction is carried out.<br>
The bisdiazonium salt may be obtained by, for instance, the reaction of 1,2-<br>
bis(2-aminophenoxy) ethane, hydrochloric acid, and sodium nitrite solution.<br>
On the other hand, in the coupling reaction, the imidazolone compound is<br>
usually converted to a solution in advance and then the reaction is carried out. The<br>
solution is usually an alkaline aqueous solution.<br>
An objective crude pigment may be obtained by dropping the bisdiazonium<br>
salt and the imidazolone compound, with a theoretical molar ratio of 1:2, into the<br>
solution having a pH between 4-8 at the same time to carry out a coupling reaction.<br>
The above-mentioned coupling reaction, more specifically, can be carried out<br>
by simultaneously dropping the bisdiazonium salt and the imidazolone compound to an<br>
aqueous solution having a pH between 4-8, more preferably a pH between 5-7, at a<br>
temperature of 5-30°C, and then increasing the temperature to 60-95°C and<br>
maintaining the temperature for about 1-5 hours. According to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention, it is preferable that the addition of the bisdiazonium salt solution and<br>
the imidazolone compound solution to the above mentioned aqueous solution having a<br>
pH of 4-8 be completed within a period of 1-12 hours, more preferably within a period<br>
of 2-7 hours.<br>
It is preferable that a buffering agent for maintaining a constant pH and a<br>
coupling agent, the amount of which corresponds to 0.1-50% by weight, more<br>
preferably 1-30% by weight, of untreated pigment, be present in the aqueous solution<br>
of pH 4-8 into which the bisdiazonium salt solution and the imidazolone compound<br>
solution are dropped. Examples of the coupling agent include, for instance,<br>
conventionally known additives, such as rosins and surfactants. Among these<br>
coupling agents, when a surfactant is used, yield of the product may be increased due<br><br>
to improvement in the rate of coupling reaction, the hue may be improved, and the<br>
dispersibility of the pigment per se, which is normally obtained in a cohesive or<br>
flocculated state, may be enhanced. Also, when a rosin is used, the transparency of<br>
the product may be improved and the flocculation of pigment may be prevented. The<br>
types and the amount of the buffer agent which may be used in accordance with the<br>
present invention are not particularly limited, and for instance, an agent such as sodium<br>
acetate may be suitably used as the buffer agent.<br>
When a coupling agent is also used in the coupling reaction as mentioned<br>
above, pigment is obtained which corresponds to untreated pigment to which the<br>
coupling agent is attached in an amount corresponding to 0.1 ~ 50% by weight of the<br>
pigment.<br>
According to the present invention, the amount (mol%) of the imidazolone<br>
compound with respect to one mol of the bisdiazonium salt is not particularly limited.<br>
It is preferable that 1.995-2.300 mol of the imidazolone compound be present with<br>
respect to one mol of the bisdiazonium salt.<br>
After the coupling reaction, as mentioned above, it is preferable that the<br>
reaction solution be subjected directly to a heating process at 60-95°C since the<br>
number of steps required for the preparation of products may be reduced in comparison<br>
with a conventional method in which the reaction solution is filtered to remove liquid<br>
medium, dispersed in excessive amount of different liquid medium, such as water,<br>
methanol, or dimethyl formamide, and is then subjected to a lengthy heating process at<br>
80-150°C for 1 -10 hours to obtain a pigment. That is, by the heat treatment used in<br>
the present invention as explained above, the reaction solution after the completion of<br>
the coupling reaction need not be subjected to a tedious aftertreating process or a<br>
pigmentization process (i.e., the above-mentioned second process), which are said to<br>
be essential in conventional processes. Also, the specific surface area of the pigment<br>
may be increased if the pH of the reaction solution is adjusted to be higher than the pH<br>
at the completion of the coupling reaction, preferably pH 10 or higher, and is then<br>
subjected to a heating process at 60-95°C.<br>
It is not preferable, in terms of productivity, that the reaction solution<br>
including the pigment be filtered and subjected to an aftertreating process using a<br>
liquid medium having chemical compositions different from those present in the<br>
reaction solution in order to obtain a pigment.<br><br>
The pigment according to an embodiment of the present invention thus<br>
obtained may be used in the same manner as conventional azo pigment in a wet state<br>
after the above mentioned reaction, in a powder state, in a wet cake state, or in a slurry<br>
state. Among the pigment of these various states, the wet state pigments are generally<br>
called water-containing pigment in this specification.<br>
The compositional ratio between water and pigment in the water-containing<br>
pigment is not particularly limited. However, assuming the total amount of both is<br>
100% by weight, the amount of pigment is in the range between 10-90% by weight,<br>
and preferably in the range between 20-50% by weight if flushing, which will be<br>
described later, is carried out.<br>
The pigment, which is obtained as mentioned above and can be expressed by<br>
the above formula (1), has the BET specific surface area based on nitrogen absorption<br>
of between 20-100 m2/g. Also, the pigment has the ratio (h 1 /h2) of the absolute<br>
strength (h1) at Bragg angle 2 = 17.5° ± 0.2° to the absolute strength (h2) at Bragg<br>
angle 2 =18.2° ± 0.2° of X-ray diffraction less than 1.8/1.0.<br>
It is possible to provide a pigment dispersion by combining the pigment<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention with a thermoplastic resin. The<br>
pigment dispersion includes, based on its properties, a solid pigment dispersion and a<br>
liquid pigment dispersion. The pigment according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention can provide a pigment dispersion by being dispersed in thermoplastic resin<br>
for dispersing pigment, such as a vehicle for printing ink and a vehicle for paint.<br>
These thermoplastic resins may be produced by using any known methods.<br>
The pigment dispersion according to the present invention includes not only<br>
pigment dispersion consisting of azo pigment and a thermoplastic resin, for instance,<br>
master batch for coloring plastics and master batch for color toner but also azo pigment<br>
dispersion to which resin, such as a thermosetting resin, solvent, and other additives<br>
are added, for instance, ink for lithography, gravure ink, paints, plastics, color toner,<br>
and resist ink for producing color filter.<br>
The compositional ratio of the pigment and the thermoplastic resin is not<br>
particularly limited. For example, the amount of pigment can be 0.5-100 parts by<br>
weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of a thermoplastic resin. In the case of the<br>
above mentioned master batch, the amount of pigment is generally 50-80 parts by<br>
weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of the thermoplastic resin.<br><br>
When the pigment dispersion of the present invention is prepared, it is<br>
possible to mix pigment powder with a solid thermoplastic synthetic resin at a<br>
temperature higher than the melting temperature of the resin.<br>
In general, the water-containing pigment has an advantage in applications in<br>
which its transparency and color strength are important since the aggregation among<br>
the pigment particles which occur during a drying process is prevented and hence the<br>
degree of aggregation is less than that in the particle state. Since water present<br>
between pigment particles enhances the aggregation among the pigment particles<br>
during a drying process due to its surface tension, a pigment dispersion which is<br>
superior in terms of transparency and color strength can be obtained by avoiding such a<br>
situation, by mixing water-containing pigment with a liquid thermoplastic resin or an<br>
organic solvent containing a thermoplastic resin at a temperature less than the boiling<br>
point of water or the solvent so that water present on the surface of the pigment particle<br>
can be replaced with the resin or the organic solvent. In such a case, water or the<br>
organic solvent may be removed at an appropriate time if necessary.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, if a flushing process is<br>
carried out using the water-containing pigment and a thermoplastic resin as essential<br>
components, a pigment dispersion, which is excellent in its dispersibility and<br>
transparency, can be obtained as compared with the case where pigment powder is<br>
dispersed in a thermoplastic resin.<br>
Here, the term flushing process indicates a process in which a water-<br>
containing pigment is mixed with a thermoplastic resin as essential components, and<br>
water is removed after the pigment is converted to an organic phase from an aqueous<br>
phase. Note that the removal of water can be carried out by combining a decantation<br>
process and a heat-vacuum aspiration process.<br>
Also, although the pigment according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention can be dispersed directly in a thermoplastic resin, the pigment may also be<br>
dispersed in vehicle for printing ink or vehicle for paints containing a thermoplastic<br>
resin as an essential component.<br>
Examples of the thermoplastic resin can be used in the present invention as a<br>
dispersing resin include, for example, a polyester resin, a polyamide resin, a styrene<br>
resin, an acryl resin, a polyolefin, polyalkylene terephthalate, and a polyvinyl chloride<br>
resin.<br><br>
Vehicle for lithography printing ink, for instance, may be produced from 20-<br>
50% by weight of resin, such as a rosin denatured phenol resin, a petroleum resin, and<br>
an alkyd resin, 0-30% by weight of animal or vegetable oil, such as linseed oil, tung oil,<br>
and soybean oil, 10-60% by weight of solvent, such as n-paraffin, isoparaffin,<br>
naphthene,  -olefin, and aromatic, and a few percent by weight of additives, such as<br>
a solubilizing agent, and a gelling agent.<br>
Also, vehicle for gravure printing ink or vehicle for flexo graphic ink may be<br>
produced from, for instance, 10-50% by weight of at least one of resins selected from<br>
rosins, maleate resin, polyamide resin, vinyl resin, cyclized rubber, chlorinated rubber,<br>
ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer resin, urethane resin, polyester resin, alkyd resin,<br>
nitrocellulose, cellulose acetate, etc., and 30-80% by weight of solvent, such as alcohol,<br>
toluene, n-hexane, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, cellosolve, and butyl cellosolve.<br>
In addition, vehicle for paints may be produced from, for instance, 20-80%<br>
by weight of resin, such as an alkyd resin, an epoxy resin, an acryl resin, a<br>
polyurethane resin, a polyester resin, a melamine resin, an urea resin, an aqueous resin,<br>
and 10-60% by weight of solvent, such as hydrocarbon, alcohol, ketone, and water.<br>
When a colored product is produced, for instance, polyolefin, such as<br>
polyethylene and polypropylene, and a thermoplastic resin (plastic), such as polyvinyl<br>
chloride resin, which can be used for thermoforming process, such as injection<br>
molding or press molding, are used as a dispersion resin. The pigment dispersion<br>
according to the present invention obtained by using these resins may be formed into a<br>
required shape to produce a colored product.<br>
When an electrostatic image developing toner is produced, a thermoplastic<br>
resin capable of forming a solid coating at ordinary temperature, such as a polyester<br>
resin, an epoxy resin, a polyamide resin, a styrene resin, and an acryl resin, is used as a<br>
dispersion resin. The pigment dispersion according to the present invention obtained<br>
by using these resins, which is in a solid form at ordinary temperature, can be ground<br>
and separated into a required particle size to be used as an electrostatic image<br>
developing toner, which will be described later in detail.<br>
These pigment dispersion may be mixed, if necessary, with other resins,<br>
rubbers, additives, pigments, and colorants to be finally produced and used as printing<br>
ink, paints, molded products (plastic), toners, color filters, and so forth.<br><br>
Unlimited examples of dispersing devices used for dispersing the pigment<br>
into a thermoplastic synthetic resin when a pigment dispersion is prepared, include<br>
known dispersing devices, such as a disper, a homomixer, a bead mill, a two-piece<br>
roller mill, a three-piece roller mill, an ordinary and applied pressure kneader, and an<br>
ultrasonic dispersing device.<br>
Conditions used for a dispersing process depends on a dispersion medium<br>
and a dispersing device used. Accordingly, the temperature and time period for the<br>
dispersion process are not particularly limited. However, in general, the dispersion<br>
temperature is between room temperature and 300°C, preferably between room<br>
temperature and 240°C, and the dispersion period is one minute to 120 hours, and<br>
preferably three minutes to 7 hours.<br>
The proportion of the pigment in the pigment dispersion is not particularly<br>
limited, and generally is in a range between a few percent by weight and 30% by<br>
weight. However, this may vary depending on application, and for instance, 13-20%<br>
by weight in lithography ink, 3-20% by weight in gravure ink, 0.3-15% by weight in<br>
paint, 0.01-1% by weight in coloring plastic, 4-10% by weight in toner, and 4-7% by<br>
weight in resist ink in a color filter application.<br>
As explained above, the azo pigment dispersion according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention can be used in any of known applications. However, in<br>
addition to such conventional applications, the azo pigment dispersion according to the<br>
present invention is also suitably applied to a use in which it is subjected to a higher<br>
temperature, such as for the case of a colored product made of a high-melting point<br>
thermoplastic resin, such as polyphenylene sulfide and polybutylene terephthalate, or<br>
the case of an electrostatic image developing toner which is produced via a heat setting<br>
fixation process.<br>
The pigment dispersion according to an embodiment invention may also be<br>
used as, for instance, paste color or dry color. When the pigment dispersion is<br>
directly used as a coloring master batch for uncolored thermoplastic resin, which is<br>
used as a binder resin for the above mentioned colored product or the electrostatic<br>
image developing toner, a product or toner which is more uniformly colored in a<br>
shorter period of time can be obtained as compared with the case where it is directly<br>
mixed with the whole quantity of a thermoplastic resin.<br><br>
When a pigment dispersion containing the pigment of the present invention<br>
and a thermoplastic resin is prepared, use of the above-mentioned flushing process is<br>
particularly effective in order to obtain a maximum degree of its performance.<br>
In particular, for an application as pigment which requires transparency, a<br>
pigment dispersion having better quality may be obtained when a water-containing<br>
pigment and a thermoplastic resin are subjected to a flushing process as compared with<br>
the case where powder pigment, which tends to cause strong aggregation among<br>
pigment particles during a drying process and whose dispersibility in a thermoplastic<br>
resin tends to be reduced, is mixed with a thermoplastic resin.<br>
The characteristic of a pigment dispersion having high transparency<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention leads to an effect of obtaining a<br>
clear image having excellent coloring property in the field of full color toner in which<br>
a color image is produced by superimposing each of the color toner.<br>
The electrostatic image developing toner including the pigment according to<br>
an embodiment of the present invention may be used as magnetic one-component color<br>
toner which includes a magnetic substance in the toner (i.e., magnetic one-component<br>
developing color toner), non-magnetic one-component color toner which does not<br>
include a magnetic substance (i.e., non-magnetic one-component developing color<br>
toner), or two-component color developing color toner which is mixed with a carrier,<br>
(two-component developing color toner).<br>
The magnetic one-component color toner may be prepared from, similar to<br>
conventional toner, for instance, a colorant, a binding resin, magnetic powder, a charge<br>
controlling agent (CCA), and other additives, such as a mold releasing agent.<br>
The amount of pigment contained in an electrostatic image developing toner<br>
including the pigment of the present invention is not particularly limited. However, it<br>
is preferable that 0.5-25 parts by weight of the pigment be present with respect to 100<br>
parts by weight of the binding resin. It is more preferable that 2-10 parts by weight of<br>
pigment be present with respect to 100 parts by weight of the binding resin in order to<br>
make conspicuous the electrification property the colorant possesses.<br>
As a binding resin used for an electrostatic image developing toner including<br>
the pigment according to the present invention, any known thermoplastic resins<br>
mentioned above can be utilized including synthetic resins, natural resins, natural<br><br>
rubbers, synthetic rubbers, and synthetic waxes, which exhibit adhesive properties<br>
under applied heat or pressure condition.<br>
Examples of the synthetic waxes, which may be used for an electrostatic<br>
image developing toner including the pigment according to the present invention,<br>
include, for instance, chlorinated paraffin wax, paraffin wax, polypropylene wax, and<br>
PVC.<br>
Also, examples of natural resins, use of which is effective in the present<br>
invention, include, for instance, balsam resin, rosin, shellac, and coval. These resins<br>
may be denatured with one or more of vinyl resin, acryl resin, alkyd resin, phenol resin,<br>
which will be described later.<br>
Also, examples of the natural or synthetic rubber material include, for<br>
instance, natural rubber, chlorinated rubber, cyclized rubber, polyisobutylene rubber,<br>
ethylene-propylene rubber, polybutadiene rubber, butyl rubber, styrene-butadiene<br>
rubber, acrylonitrile-butadinene rubber, chloroprene rubber, silicone rubber, and<br>
fluorinated rubber.<br>
The binder resin used for an electrostatic image developing toner including<br>
the pigment according to the present invention is not limited to the ones mentioned<br>
above, and two or more of binding resin components may be mixed in an appropriate<br>
manner.<br>
As a binding resin, use of one whose glass transition temperature is 45-85°C<br>
measured by a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and whose temperature at<br>
which its melt viscosity becomes 1 x 105 poise is 95-170°C measured by a constant<br>
load extrusion tubule type rheometer is preferable (measurement conditions: elevated<br>
flow tester; Shimadzu flow tester CFT-C type: piston cross-sectional area of 1 cm2,<br>
cylinder pressure of 0.98 MPa, die length of 1 mm, die hole size of 1 mm,<br>
measurement starting temperature of 50°C, temperature increase rate of 6°C/min, and<br>
sample weight of 1.5 g).<br>
Among them, a styrene resin, an acryl resin, a polyester resin, and an epoxy<br>
resin can be used advantageously in terms of their transparency and the hue of toner.<br>
Use of a polyester resin is particularly preferable.<br>
Magnetic powder which can be used in an electrostatic image developing<br>
toner including the pigment according to the present invention is not limited. It is<br>
preferable, however, to use one whose color tends not be reflected on the color to be<br><br>
produced. Examples of such include, for instance, iron oxide, such as y -iron oxide,<br>
yellow y -iron oxide, and ferrite; metals, such as iron, cobalt, and nickel or alloys of<br>
these metals with aluminum, cobalt, copper, lead, magnesium, tin, and zinc; organic<br>
magnetic substances, such as poly-l,4-bis(2, 2, 6, 6-tetramethyl-4-oxyl-4-piperidyl-l-<br>
oxyl)butadiene porphyrin metal complex, and mixtures thereof. Among these, use of<br>
yellow y -iron oxide is preferable in terms of its hue.<br>
The average particle size of the magnetic powder may be in the range<br>
between 0.1 and 1 µ m, preferably in the range between 0.1 and 0.5 µ m, from the<br>
viewpoint of electrification stability and hue. Also, the amount of the magnetic<br>
powder contained in toner can be in a range between 30-150% by weight with respect<br>
to 100 parts by weight of a binding resin. It is preferable that the amount of the<br>
magnetic powder be in a range between 40-120% by weight with respect to 100 parts<br>
by weight of the binding powder from the viewpoint of electrification stability and hue.<br>
If necessary, various plasticizers, resistance regulating agents, and charge<br>
controlling agents may be added to an electrification developing toner including the<br>
pigment according to an embodiment of the present invention in order to adjust<br>
thermal, electric, and physical properties of the toner.<br>
Examples of the plasticizer include, for instance, dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl<br>
phthalate. Examples of resistance regulating agent include, for instance, tin oxide,<br>
lead oxide, and antimony oxide. Examples of the charge controlling agent include,<br>
for instance, quaternary ammonium salt, pyridinium salt, and metal complex die.<br>
Also, in the electrostatic image developing toner containing the pigment<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention, it is possible to add, after the<br>
production of toner particles, fine particles of TiO2, A12O3, SiO2, etc., to improve flow<br>
properties of the toner, or zinc stearate or phthalate to prevent deterioration of a<br>
sensitizing material.<br>
No special method is required for the production of the electrostatic image<br>
developing toner including the pigment according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, and it can be produced by using a method which is employed quite<br>
commonly in the field. For example, each of the above-mentioned component may<br>
be mixed by using a kneading means, such as an extruder, a 2 roll mill or 3 roll mill, or<br>
a heating kneader, to obtain a mixture including a pigment dispersion of the present<br>
invention, and this may be ground using a grinding machine, such as a jet mill, after<br><br>
cooling. Then, the ground material can be air classified to obtain an objective color<br>
toner powder according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Also, if a master batch of the pigment dispersion including a high<br>
concentration of the pigment according to an embodiment of the present invention is<br>
prepared in advance using a binding resin for toner as a thermoplastic resin, and this is<br>
mixed and diluted with the same or a different binding resin so as to obtain a pigment<br>
dispersion according to an embodiment of the present invention having a<br>
predetermined pigment concentration, toner that is excellent in image transparency can<br>
be obtained as compared with the case where a master batch is not used in the<br>
production.<br>
Moreover, by combining the above-mentioned flushing process with the<br>
master batch method, it becomes possible to obtain toner from which image having a<br>
most excellent transparency, color development, and brightness property is produced,<br>
in comparison with the other methods where the same resin is used.<br>
Note that the color toner including the pigment of the present invention is a<br>
particle type dispersion in which the pigment is dispersed in the above-mentioned<br>
binding resin and the average particle size of the toner particle is preferably in a range<br>
between 3-5µm.<br>
Also, when used as a two-component color developing color toner, the same<br>
colorant, the binding resin, and the additives used for the one-component color<br>
magnetic toner may also be employed.<br>
Moreover, examples of a carrier that can be used in an electrostatic image<br>
developing toner including the pigment according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention include, for instance, iron powder, nickel powder, ferrite powder, glass beads,<br>
and coated material of these powders and beads with styrene-acrylic ester copolymer,<br>
styrene-methacrylate copolymer, acrylic ester polymer, methacrylate ester polymer,<br>
silicone resin, polyamide resin or mixture thereof. It is preferable that the particle<br>
size thereof be in a range between 50-300 µ m.<br>
The two-component color developing color toner may be obtained by friction<br>
mixing these carrier particles with color toner including the pigment according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention in a horizontal cylinder or a V-shape container-<br>
rotation type mixer.<br><br>
Also, the mixing ratio of the carrier and the color toner is usually 2-10 parts<br>
by weight, preferably 4-6 parts by weight, of color toner with respect to 100 parts by<br>
weight of the carrier in order to obtain an appropriate image concentration.<br>
Examples:<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail with reference to<br>
Preparation Examples, Examples, and Comparative Examples. Note that "parts" and<br>
"%" used in the following indicate "parts by weight" and "% by weight", respectively,<br>
unless otherwise indicated.<br>
Preparation Example 1:<br>
After 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane (45 parts) was dispersed in water (650<br>
parts), 35% hydrochloric acid (107.7 parts) was added. Then, 40% sodium nitrite<br>
solution (67.4 parts) was dropped to the dispersion to produce a diazo component<br>
while maintaining the temperature of the solution at 5°C or below by adding ice. On<br>
the other hand, 5-acetoacetylamino-benzimidazolone (93 parts) was dispersed in water<br>
(675 parts), and 25% sodium hydroxide aqueous solution (119 parts) was added to the<br>
dispersion to obtain a coupler component. Then, water and ice were added to the<br>
diazo component and the coupler component to adjust the amount thereof to 1300 parts<br>
and 900 parts, respectively.<br>
Then, 90% acetic acid (6 parts) and polyoxyethylene lauryl ether (13.5 parts)<br>
were added to water (1300 parts), and the temperature and pH of the solution were<br>
adjusted to be 20°C and 6.0, respectively. After the coupler component prepared as<br>
mentioned above was dropped into the acetic acid solution and pH of the solution was<br>
adjusted to 6.0, the diazo component was dropped into the solution at a constant rate.<br>
At the same time as the diazo solution was dropped into the solution, the<br>
coupler component was also dropped into the solution so that excess amount of<br>
diazonium salt would not be present in the acetic acid solution, and the coupling<br>
reaction was carried out while maintaining the pH of the acetic acid solution at 6.0 by<br>
adjusting the dropping rate of the coupler component. The temperature and the pH of<br>
the solution were maintained at 20°C and 6.0, respectively, during the coupling<br>
reaction by adding ice or 5% sodium hydroxide solution, and the reaction was<br>
completed after about three hours. Then, the solution was heated to 90°C and the<br>
temperature was maintained for one hour.<br><br>
After th1s, the precipitate was filtered and washed with water to obtain water-<br>
containing pigment (30% pigment content), and the pigment was dried at 700C. Solid<br>
matter obtained was ground using a blender, and powder of disazo yellow pigment<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention containing compound expressed<br>
by the formula (1) was obtained.<br>
The BET specific surface area based on nitrogen absorption process, wh1ch<br>
was measured by using Micro sorp 4232 II (a product of Micro-Data Co. Ltd.), of the<br>
obtained pigment powder was 35 m2/g.<br>
A powder X-ray diffraction diagram using the CuK  characteristic X-ray of<br>
the pigment was obtained, and in accordance with the graph shown in FIG. 1, the<br>
height of a peak at Bragg angle 2  = 17.5° ± 0.2° was measured from the base line.<br>
Th1s was used as the absolute strength (h1). Similarly, the distance between the<br>
trough at Bragg angle 2  = 18.2° ± 0.2° and the base line was measured, and th1s<br>
was used as the absolute strength (h2). Note that the h1ghest absolute strength in the<br>
range of Bragg angle 2 = 17.5° ± 0.2° was selected as h1, and the lowest absolute<br>
strength in the range of Bragg angle 2=18.2° ± 0.2° was selected as h2. Using<br>
thus obtained h1 and h2, the absolute strength ratio (hl/h2) was calculated (the same<br>
method was adopted for each of the following Preparation Examples).<br>
As a result, the ratio (hl/h2) of the absolute strength (h1) of the X-ray<br>
diffraction at Bragg angle 2 = 17.5° ± 0.2° to the absolute strength (h2) of the X-<br>
ray diffraction at Bragg angle 2=18.2° ± 0.2° of the pigment in the powder X-ray<br>
diffraction diagram using the CuK  characteristic X-ray was found to be 1.44/1.00.<br>
Preparation Example 2<br>
A water-containing pigment (28% pigment content) and a disazo yellow<br>
pigment powder according to an embodiment of the present was obtained by using the<br>
same method as in Preparation Example 1 except that the amount of 5-<br>
acetoacetylamino-benzimidazolone used was changed to 90 parts from 93 parts,<br>
polyoxyethylene lauryl ether was not added to the acetic acid solution, and the pH of<br>
the solution was adjusted to be 12 using sodium hydroxide solution before heating the<br>
solution to 90°C.<br>
The specific surface area and the ratio of the absolute strength (hl/h2) based<br>
on the above mentioned X-ray diffraction of the obtained powder pigment were<br><br>
measured using the same methods as above and they were found to be 76.1 m2/g and<br>
1.29/1.00, respectively.<br>
Preparation Example 3<br>
Wh1le 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane (73.2 parts) was dispersed in water<br>
(300 parts) with stirring, 35% hydrochloric acid (132.9 parts) was added to the<br>
dispersion. After stirring the solution for one hour, the temperature of the solution<br>
was adjusted to be in the range of 0-5°C by using ice, and 40% sodium nitrite aqueous<br>
solution (41.8 g) was added to the solution to carry out a diazotization reaction. After<br>
stirring the solution for more than one hour, sulfamic acid (20 parts) was added and<br>
stirred for more than ten minutes to remove excess nitrite, and a bis diazonium salt<br>
solution was prepared.<br>
On the other hand, after 5-acetoacetylamino-benzimidazolone (150.8 parts)<br>
was dispersed in water (900 parts), 25% sodium hydroxide solution (198 parts) was<br>
added to dissolve the compound. Wh1le the temperature of the solution was<br>
maintained at 5°C by using ice, the pH of the solution was adjusted to be 5.3 using<br>
acetic acid in the presence of dimethylcocoalkylamineoxide (12 parts) to obtain a<br>
precipitate.<br>
In order to carry out a coupling reaction, the diazo solution was added to the<br>
coupler solution at 25°C for ten minutes. After the completion of the coupling<br>
reaction, powder chalk (40 parts) was added, and after 10 minutes, the pH of the<br>
solution was adjusted at 5.0.<br>
Then, the precipitate was filtered and washed with water to obtain water-<br>
containing pigment (30% pigment content), and the pigment was dried. Solid matter<br>
obtained was ground by using a blender to obtain pigment powder. The specific<br>
surface area of the obtained pigment powder was 1 m2/g.<br>
Preparation Example 4<br>
Pigment was prepared by using the same manner as in Preparation Example 3<br>
except that alkylethyleneoxide polyglycol phosphate (6 parts) and fatty alcohol<br>
propylene glycol ester (6 parts), wh1ch was derived from isotridecyl alcohol, were used<br>
instead of dimethylcocoalkylamineoxide (12 parts) and that the coupling reaction was<br>
carried out for 3 0 minutes at 25 °C. The specific surface area of the obtained powder<br>
pigment was 9.6 m2/g.<br>
Preparation Example 5<br><br>
A wet product of disazo yellow pigment (30% pigment content) was obtained<br>
by filtering, and wash1ng slurry of the pigment, wh1ch was obtained by the method as<br>
in Preparation Example 4 and further subjecting the resulting material to a heating<br>
process, and using directly as a wet product.<br>
The water-containing pigment (367 parts), together with water (1133 parts)<br>
and isobutanol (910 parts), was subjected to a pigmentization process at 110°C for two<br>
hours. Then, the obtained substance was filtered and washed with water to obtain<br>
water-containing pigment (31% pigment content), and th1s was dried. Obtained solid<br>
matter was ground by using a blender to obtain yellow disazo pigment. The specific<br>
surface area of the obtained azo pigment powder was 62 m2/g, and the ratio of the<br>
absolute strength (hl/h2) in the above-mentioned X-ray diffraction was 2.19/1.00.<br>
Example 1<br>
After the pigment powder obtained in Preparation Example 1 was mixed with<br>
KM-51 (a varnish for lithography ink, a product of Dainippon Ink and Chemicals,<br>
Incorporated) and light oil, an offset ink having 17% pigment content and a tack value<br>
of 8.5-9.5 was prepared by using a three-piece roller mill. The final compositions of<br>
the ink were as shown below.<br>
Pigment powder	17 parts<br>
KM-51 varnish	65 parts<br>
Light oil	18 parts<br>
Example 2 and Comparative Example 1-5<br>
Offset inks were prepared in accordance with the method used in Example 1<br>
except that pigment powder prepared in Preparation Examples 2-6 and a commercially<br>
available pigment yellow 180 powder ("Novoperm Yellow P-HG" and "Toner Yellow<br>
HG VP2155"; products of Clariant Japan Co.) were used instead of the pigment<br>
powder prepared in Preparation Example 1.<br>
(Evaluation method)<br>
The transparency of the offset inks were evaluated by applying the prepared<br>
inks to art paper. That is, the transparency of the offset inks were measured and<br>
categorized to seven levels (i.e., 1 (lowest transparency) to 7 (h1ghest transparency)) by<br>
visual observation based on comparative assessment using an art paper, on wh1ch the<br>
pigment of Example 1 was applied, as a standard. Also, the color strength of the<br>
offset inks were measured and categorized in seven levels (i.e., 1 (lowest color<br><br>
strength) to 7 (h1ghest color strength)) by visual observation of a piece of art paper on<br>
wh1ch a green ink prepared by subjecting the offset ink (1 part) prepared as above and<br>
a blue standard ink (5 parts), wh1ch includes phthalocyanine blue, titanium wh1te, and<br>
varnish, to an ink mill process of 100 rotations x 3 times under applied weight of<br>
300 pounds using a Hoover's muller, was applied in comparison with a piece of art<br>
paper obtained from Example 1 as a standard. Results of the evaluation for Examples<br>
1-2 and Comparative Examples 1-5 are tabulated in Table 1.<br><br>
In Table 1, the specific surface area indicates the BET specific surface area<br>
based on a nitrogen absorption process, wh1ch was measured by using Micro sorp 4232<br>
II (a product of Micro-Data Co. Ltd.), and the X-ray strength ratio is the ratio between<br>
the absolute strength (h1) of the X-ray diffraction at Bragg angle 2 =17.5° ± 0.2°<br>
and the absolute strength (h2) of the X-ray diffraction at Bragg angle 2 =18.2° ±<br>
0.2° in the powder X-ray diffraction diagram using CuK  characteristic X-ray.<br>
Note that the specific surface area and the X-ray strength ratio of the commercially<br>
available "Novoperm Yellow P-HG" and "Toner Yellow HG VP2155" were measured<br>
by using the same method for the colorant obtained in Preparation Examples and<br>
tabulated in Table 1.<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of electrostatic charge developing toner<br><br>
The water-containing pigment (30% pigment content) obtained in Preparation<br>
Example 1 and "Himer SBM100" (a styrene-acrylic acid copolymer resin, a product of<br>
Sanyo Chemical Industries, Ltd.) in the following amounts:<br>
Water-containing pigment 267 parts<br>
h1mer SBM100	120 parts<br>
were mixed in a kneader for 30 minutes at 100°C to carry out a flush1ng process, and a<br>
pigment dispersion (master batch) according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention was obtained.<br>
The master batch and the resin in the amounts shown below:<br>
Master batch	12.5 parts<br>
h1mer SBM100	92.5 parts<br>
were kneaded in an extruder, and th1s was ground and separated using a jet mill to<br>
obtain toner having average particle size of 10 µ m. The obtained toner was mixed<br>
with 1.0% of hydrophobic silica ("Aerosil R-972", a product of Nippon Aerosil Co.<br>
Ltd.) to obtain electrostatic image developing (two components developing) yellow<br>
toner including the pigment according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Note that the temperature range of "h1mer SBM 100" at wh1ch its melt<br>
viscosity becomes 1 x 105 poise using the devices and conditions mentioned above was<br>
between 110 and 170°C.<br>
Evaluation of color toner<br>
The two components developing yellow toner was mixed with a<br>
commercially available ferrite carrier used for development to obtain a two component<br>
developer. When th1s developer was employed for a development process using a dry<br>
type plain paper copier ("Ricopy FT 3010", a product of Ricoh Company, Ltd.), a clear<br>
yellow image with no background fog was obtained even after 5,000 pieces of paper<br>
were copied (Evaluation is ©).<br>
After th1s, when combined with a cyan developer, in wh1ch C.I. Pigment Blue<br>
15:3 was contained, and developed, a clear green was reproduced.<br>
Also, when combined with a magenta developer, in wh1ch C.I. Pigment Red<br>
122 was contained, and developed, a clear red was reproduced (Evaluation is O).<br>
Example 4, Comparative Examples 6-8<br>
An electrostatic image developing (two component developing) yellow toner<br>
including the pigment according to an embodiment of the present invention was<br><br>
prepared as in Example 3 except that the water-containing azo pigment obtained in<br>
Preparation Examples 2-4 and the water-containing pigment obtained in Preparation<br>
Example 5, the amount of wh1ch corresponded to 80 g when dried, were used instead<br>
of the water-containing pigment (267 parts) obtained in Preparation Example 1. The<br>
obtained developers (two components developing yellow toner) were employed for a<br>
development process using a dry type plain paper copier ("Ricopy FT 3010", a product<br>
of Ricoh Company, Ltd.) as in Example 3. Results are shown in Table 2.<br>
As is obvious from Table 2, when the color toners according to the present<br>
invention were used, clear images were obtained since the dispersibility thereof was<br>
improved to enhance the transparency and the color strength. On the other hand,<br>
when a pigment dispersion including the conventional pigment of known properties<br>
were used, images obtained from the developers using the pigment dispersion were<br>
unclear since the dispersibility thereof was not sufficient.<br>
Also, when the developer including the pigment dispersion according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention was combined with a cyan developer including<br>
C.I. Pigment Blue 15:3 or a magenta developer including C.I. Pigment Red 122, a clear<br>
green and a clear red, respectively, was reproduced.<br>
On the other hand, when the developer prepared from the conventional<br>
pigment dispersion of known properties was combined with a cyan developer<br>
including C.I. Pigment Blue 15:3 or a magenta developer including C.I. Pigment Red<br>
122, its blueness or redness was too strong, and a clear green and a clear red,<br>
respectively, could not be obtained.<br>
In addition, the developers including the pigment according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention showed better results in comparison with the<br>
developers prepared from conventional pigment of known properties,.<br><br><br>
