INHIBITORS OF HUMAN TUMOR-EXPRESSED CCXCKR2<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[001]	This application claims priority to U.S. provisional application<br>
Serial No. 60/434,912 filed December 20, 2002 and U.S. provisional application Serial No. 60/516,151 filed October 30, 2003. The disclosures of the priority applications are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[002]	The present invention is directed to novel compounds and<br>
pharmaceutical compositions that inhibit the binding of the SDF-1 chemokine (also known as the CXCL12 chemokine) or l-TAC (also known as CXCL11) to the chemokine receptor CCXCKR2. These compounds are useful in preventing tumor cell proliferation, tumor formation, and metastasis.<br>
[003]	Chemokines are a superfamily of small, cytokine-like proteins<br>
that induce cytoskeletal rearrangement, firm adhesion to endothelial cells, and directional migration and may also effect cell activation and proliferation. Chemokines act in a coordinated fashion with cell surface proteins to direct the specific homing of various subsets of ceils to specific anatomical sites.<br>
[004]	Early research efforts by a number of groups have indicated a<br>
role for the chemokine receptor CXCR4 in metastasis and tumor growth. Muller, et al., "Involvement of Chemokine Receptors in Breast Cancer Metastasis," Nature, 410:50-56 (2001) demonstrated that breast tumor cells use chemokine-mediated mechanisms, such as those regulating leukocyte trafficking, during the process of metastasis. Tumor cells express a distinct, non-random pattern of functionally active chemokine receptors. Signaling through CXCR4 mediates actin polymerization and<br><br>
pseudopodia formation in breast cancer cells, and induces chemotactic and invasive responses. Additionally, the organs representing the main sites of breast cancer metastasis (such as lymph nodes, bone marrow, and lungs) are the most abundant sources of ligand for the CXCR4 receptor.<br>
[005]	Using immunodeficient mice, Muller and colleagues<br>
succeeded in reducing the metastasis of injected human breast cancer cells by treating mice with an antibody known to bind CXCR4. Their finding suggests that breast cancer metastasis could be reduced by treating a patient with a CXCR4 antagonist.<br>
[006]	Bertolini, et aL, "CXCR4 Neutralization, a Novel Therapeutic<br>
Approach for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma," Cancer Research, 62:3106-3112 (2002) demonstrated a reduction of tumor volume as well as prolonged survival of immunodeficient mice injected with human lymphoma ceils treated with anti-CXCR4 antibodies. They interpreted their finding to mean that tumor volume could be reduced by treating a patient with a CXCR4 antagonist.<br>
[007]	More recent studies suggest that another chemokine<br>
receptor, CCXCKR2, may also be a potential candidate in the treatment of cancer. CCXCKR2 is preferentially expressed in transformed cells over normal cells, with detectable expression in a number of human cancers. In vitro studies indicate that proliferation of CCXCKR2 expressing cells can be inhibited by an antagonist of CCXCKR2. In vivo studies in mice indicate that CCXCKR2 antagonists can inhibit tumor formation and tumor growth.<br>
[008]	The potential importance of CCXCKR2 is illustrated by an<br>
alternative interpretation of the reduction in tumor volume seen by Bertolini and colleagues. This reduction-could clearly be the result of an antibody-mediated clearance, and not the result of thp anti-OXCR4 pntihnHv **<br><br>
originally believed. In an antibody-mediated clearance, any antibody that recognized a protein on the cell surface of the lymphoma cells would have had the same effect as that attributed to the anti-CXCR4 antibody. Unfortunately, Bertolini and colleagues studies are inconclusive as to whether the observed tumor response was due to antibody-mediated clearance or interaction with CXCR4.<br>
[009]	However it is now known that the lymphoma cells used by<br>
Bertolini and colleagues express both CXCR4 and CCXCKR2. SDF-1 is the only ligand for CXCR4. SDF-1 and l-TAC both bind CCXCKR2. Using anti-SDF-1 antibody, it has now been shown that antagonists of CCXCKR2 are responsible for the reduction in tumor load and increased survival rate. Because SDF-1 is the only ligand for CXCR4, one would expect neutralization of SDF-1 with anti-SDF-1 antibody would be equivalent to the neutralization of CXCR4 with anti-CXCR4 antibody. However, experiments using an anti-SDF-1 antibody demonstrated only a partial reduction in tumor load and an increased survival rate. This leads one to believe-that CCXCKR2 is the actual target, as the continued activity is likely due to the interactions of the second ligand, l-TAC, with CCXCKR2.<br>
[0010]	Until recently, the possible importance of CCXCKR2 in tumor<br>
cell proliferation, tumor growth, and metastasis was unknown. Now, with recent evidence pointing to the ability of certain CCXCKR2 antagonists to prevent the growth and spread of cancer, and expression patterns indicating a limited tissue distribution for the CCXCKR2 receptor, it would be beneficial to provide compounds that are able to bind specifically to the CCXCKR2 receptor on tumor cells with potentially few side effects.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0011]	The present invention is directed to novel compounds and<br>
compositions containing small molecule modulators that bind to the<br><br><br><br>

Modulators<br>
[0045]	The present invention provides modulators for use in the<br>
treatment of cancer. These compounds can serve as modulators of SDF-1 and l-TAC by binding with the CCXCKR2 receptor. Modulators (I) may also serve as modulators against other chemokine receptors. The chemokine family of peptides is defined on the basis of sequence homology and on the presence of variations on a conserved cysteine motif. Schall (1996) Cytokine 3:165-183; and Oppenheim et al. (1991) Annu. Rev. Immunol. 9:617-648.   Chemokines display a range of in vitro and in vivo functions ranging from proinflammatory activities on a range of cell types to proliferative regulatory activities. To date several chemokine receptors have been described. See, for e.g., Neote et al. (1993) Cell<br><br>
72:415-425; Ponath etal. (1996) J. Exp. Med. 183:2437-2448; and Power etal. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270:19495-19500.<br>

[0069]	Alternatively, the transformation of intermediate (4) to<br>
compound (5) can also be obtained with a suitable coupling reagent, such as propane phosphonic acid cyclic anhydride, O-(benzotriazol-l-yl)-N,N,N\N'-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylbutylpropyl) carbodiimide or Dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide (as described in B. Neises and W. Stegiich, Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. Engl., 17, 522, 1978), in the presence of a catalyst, such as 4-N,N-dimethylamino-pyridine, or in the presence of hydroxybenzotriazole (as described in K. Horiki, Synth. Commun., 7,251).<br>
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS<br>
[0070]	Pharmaceutical compositions for administration of the claimed<br>
active compounds (or salts thereof) may be presented in a dosage unit form and may be prepared by any of the methods known in the art of pharmacy. Preferred methods include the step of combining the active compound, compounds, or salt thereof with one or more carrier that includes one or more accessory ingredient.<br><br>
[0071]	In one embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions are<br>
prepared by bringing an active compound or salt thereof into association with a liquid carrier, a finely divided solid carrier, or both. If desired, the composition may then be shaped into a product of the desired formulation. In the pharmaceutical composition, the active compound is included in a therapeutically effective amount. *<br>
[0072]	Pharmaceutical compositions, including, but not limited to<br>
pharmaceutically-acceptable salts, containing the active compound may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hardjor. soft capsules, syrups, or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents, and preserving agents to provide pharmaceutical^ elegant and palatable preparations.<br>
[0073]	Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-<br>
toxic pharmaceutical^ acceptable excipients that are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may include, for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, for example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. The tabtet.may also be coated by the<br><br>
techniques described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,256,108; 4,166,452; and 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for controlled release.<br>
[0074]	Formulations for oral use may also be hard gelatin capsules,<br>
wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules, wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.<br>
[0075]	Aqueous suspensions may also contain the active<br>
compositions in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are often referred to as suspending agents, dispersing agents, or wetting agents.  Preferable suspending agents include, for example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxy-propylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth, and gum acacia.<br>
[0076]	Preferable dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-<br>
occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin; condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate; condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol; condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol, such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate; or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example, ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate; one or more coloring agents; one or more flavoring agents; and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.<br><br>
[0077]	Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active<br>
ingredient in a vegetable oil, such as arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil, or coconut oil; or in a mineral oil, such as,liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin, or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.<br>
[0078]	Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of<br>
an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, a suspending agent, and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present.<br>
[0079]	The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also<br>
be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally- occurring gums, such as gum acacia or gum tragacanth; naturally-occurring phosphatides, such as soy bean, lecithin, esters, and partial esters derived from fatty acids; hexitol anhydrides, such as sorbitan monooleate; and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavoring agents.<br>
[0080]	Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents,<br>
such as glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative, flavoring, and coloring agents.<br><br>
[0081]	The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also<br>
be used in combined therapy to modulate chemokine receptor activity and thereby prevent and treat inflammatory and immunoregulatory disorders and diseases, including asthma and allergic diseases, as well as autoimmune pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis, AIDS, and atherosclerosis, etc. For example, in the treatment or prevention of inflammation, the present compounds may be used in conjunction with an anti-inflammatory or analgesic agent such as an opiate agonist, a lipoxygenase inhibitor, such as an inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, such as a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, an interleukin inhibitor, such as an interleukin-1 inhibitor, an NMDA antagonist, an inhibitor of nitric oxide or an inhibitor of the synthesis of nitric oxide, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, or a cytokine-suppressing anti-inflammatory agent, for example with a compound such as acetaminophen, aspirin, codene, fentanyi, ibuprofen, indomethacin, ketorolac, morphine, naproxen, phenacetin, piroxicam, a steroidal ... analgesic, sufentanyl, sunlindac, tenidap, and the like. Similarly, the instant compounds may be administered with a pain reliever; a potentiator such as caffeine, an H2-antagonist, simethicone, aluminum or magnesium hydroxide; a decongestant such as phenylephrine, phenylpropanolamine, pseudophedrine, oxymetazoline, epinephrine, naphazoline, xylometazoline, propylhexedrine, or levo-desoxy-ephedrine; an antuitussive such as codeine, hydrocodone, caramiphen, carbetapentane, ordextramethorphan; a diuretic; and a sedating or non-sedating antihistamine.<br>
[0082]	Compounds of the present invention may be used in<br>
combination with other drugs that are used in the treatment /prevention/suppression or amelioration of the diseases or conditions for which compounds of the present invention are useful. Such other drugs may be administered, by a route and in an amount commonly used,<br><br>
contemporaneously or sequentially with a compound of the present invention. When a compound of the present invention is used contemporaneously with one or more other drugs, a pharmaceutical composition containing such other drugs in addition to the compound of the present invention is preferred. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include those that also contain one or more other active ingredients, in addition to a compound of the present invention.<br>
[0083]	The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of an<br>
injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents, including those mentioned above. The injectable preparation may also be a sterile, injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. Acceptable vehicles and solvents include water,"Ringer's solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- ordi-glycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. The compositions of the present invention can be injected directly into a solid tumor, into tissue surrounding the solid tumor, or into a blood vessel vascularizing the solid tumor.<br>
[0084]	The compounds of the present invention may also be<br>
administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to<br><br>
release the drug. Such materials include cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.<br>
[0085]	For topical useT patches, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions,<br>
suspensions, and dispersions that contain one or more of the compounds of the present invention may be utilized. Topical application also includes mouth washes and gargles. The pharmaceutical compositions and methods of the present invention may further comprise other therapeutically active compounds that are used in the treatment of cancer.<br>
[0086]	In the treatment of cancer with the modulators of the present<br>
invention, an appropriate dosage level of the antagonist will generally be about 0.01 to 500 mg per kg patient body weight per day, which can be administered in single or multiple doses. Preferably, the dosage level will be about 0.1 to about 250 mg/kg per day; more preferably about 0.5 to about 100 mg/kg per day. A suitable dosage level may be about 0.01 to 250 mg/kg per day, about 0.05 to 100 mg/kg per day, or about 0.1 to 50 mg/kg per day. Within this range the dosage may be 0.05 to 0.5, 0.5 to 5 or 5 to 50 mg/kg per day.<br>
[0087]	For oral administration, the compositions are preferably<br>
provided in the form of tablets containing 1.0 to 1000 milligrams of the active ingredient, particularly 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0, 25.0, 50.0, 75.0, 100.0, 150.0, 200.0, 250.0, 300.0, 400.0, 500.0, 600.0, 750.0, 800.0, 900.0, and 1000.0 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated. The compounds may be administered on a regimen that includes 1 to 4 dosages per day, preferably once or twice per day.<br>
[0088]	It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level and<br>
frequency of dosage for any particular patient maybe varied and will depend upon a variety of factors. These factors include the activity of the<br><br>
specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the host undergoing therapy.<br>
METHODS OF BLOCKING THE CCXCKR2 RECEPTOR<br>
[0089]	While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the<br>
compositions of the present invention are believed to provide a method of inhibiting the binding of SDF-1 and/or l-TAC to the CCXCKR2 receptor. SDF-1 is known to provide a target for interfering with the development or spread of cancer cells in a mammal, such as a human. As shown below in examples 24-26, inhibition of the binding of l-TAC to the CCXCKR2 receptor prevents the formation of vascularized tumors. By contacting the compositions described above with a cancer cell that expresses the CCXCKR2 receptor, the invasive response that would otherwise trigger in the cancer cell can be reduced. Accordingly, the present invention is also directed to methods that are useful in the prevention and/or treatment of • cancer, particularly solid tumor cancers, more particularly breast cancer.<br>
[0090]	As determined by radiolabeled SDF-1 binding and l-TAC<br>
displacement, CCXCKR2 was preferentially expressed in human transformed cells. Included in TABLE 2 are those tissue types in which CCXCKR2 was expressed (CCXCKR2*) as well as those tissue types in which CCXCKR2 was not expressed (CCXCKR2").<br><br><br><br>
[0091]	In one embodiment, a preferred method of inhibiting the<br>
binding of the chemokines SDF-1 and/or l-TAC to a CCXCKR2 receptor includes contacting one or more of the previously mentioned compounds with a cell that expresses the CCXCKR2 receptor for a time sufficient to inhibit the binding of these chemokines to the CCXCKR2 receptor.<br>
METHODS OF TREATING CANCER<br>
[0092]	The present invention also provides a method of treating<br>
cancer. A preferred method of treating cancer, includes administering a therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the previously mentioned compounds (or salts thereof) to a cancer patient for a time sufficient to treat the cancer.<br>
[0093]	For treatment, the compositions of the present invention may<br>
be administered by oral, parenteral (e.g., intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, ICV, intracisternal injection or infusion, subcutaneous injection, or implant), by inhalation spray, nasal, vaginal, rectal, sublingual, or topical routes of administration and may be formulated, alone or together, in suitable dosage unit formulations containing conventional non-<br><br>
toxic pharmaceutical^ acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles appropriate for each route of administration.<br>
[0094]	In addition to primates, such as humans, a variety of other<br>
mammals can be treated according to the method of the present invention. For instance, mammals including, but not limited to, cows, sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, guinea pigs, rats or other bovine, ovine, equine, canine, feline, rodent or murine species can be treated. However, the method can also be practiced in other species, such as avian species (e.g., chickens).<br>
[0095]	Standard in vivo assays demonstrating that the compositions<br>
of the present invention are useful for treating cancer include those described in Bertolini, F., et al., Endostatin, an antiangiogenic drug, induces tumor stabilization after chemotherapy or anti-CD20 therapy in a NOD/SCID mouse model of human high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: Synthesis of (2-Methyl-3-pheny!-aIlylj-[2-(1-methy[-<br>
pyrrolidin-2-yl)-ethyl]-amine:<br><br>
[0097]	0.5 g of 2-(1-methyl-prrolidin-2-yl)-ethylamine (3.89 mmoi)<br>
and 0.56 g of 2-methyl-3-phenyl-propenal were combined in 20 ml of anhydrous dichloromethane. The mixture was stirred under nitrogen on 5 g of magnesium sulfate. After two days, thin layer chromatography (TLC) using a 9:1:0.1 dichloromethane/methanol/ammonium hydroxide eluent showed an absence of the starting material. The reaction mixture was filtered, and the collected solid was washed with dichloromethane. The resultant organic layer was then concentrated under vacuum. Ten ml of dry methanol was added to the residual mixture under nitrogen and the solution was cooled to 0"C. To<br>
this mixture was added 0.14 g of sodium borohydride. TLC showed an absence of starting material after about 15 minutes. The reaction was then quenched with acetone (1 ml), and the solvent was removed by distillation. The mixture was partitioned between 5 ml of water in chloroform and the layers were separated. The aqueous layer was then extracted 3 times with 30 ml chloroform. The combined organic layer was washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate, and filtered. Concentration under vacuum gave 0.78 g of a pale yellow solid. Yield: 77%.<br>

TESTING<br>
[00400]        To demonstrate that the compounds described above are useful modulators for SDF-1 and l-TAC chemokines, the compounds were screened in vitro to determine their ability to displace SDF-1 and/or l-TAC from the CCXCKR2 receptor at multiple concentrations. The compounds were combined with mammary gland cells expressing the CCXCKR2 receptor in the presence of the 125 i-labeled chemokine as detailed in Determination of !C5o values, Reagents and Cells (see below). The ability of the compounds to displace the labeled chemokine from the CCXCKR2 receptor cites at multiple concentrations was then determined with the screening process.<br>
[00401]        Compounds that were deemed effective modulators were able to displace at least 50% of either of the chemokines SDF-1 or l-TAC from the CCXCKR2 receptor at concentrations at or below 1.1 micromolar (pM) and more preferably at concentrations at or below 300 nanomolar (nM). At present, especially preferred compounds can displace at least 50% of the SDF-1 or l-TAC from the CCXCKR2 receptor at concentrations at or below 200 nM. Exemplary compounds that met these criteria are reproduced in Table I below.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
(adenocarcinoma; mammary gland) cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and was cultured in DMEM (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone Logan, UT) and bovine insulin (0.01 mg/mL) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 37° C in a humidified incubator at a 5% C02/air mixture.<br>
[00403]        Binding Analysis. Target compounds were tested to determine their ability to bind with CCXCKR2 sites on MCF-7 cells. Efficiency-maximized radioligand binding using filtration protocols as described in Dairaghi DJ, et al., HHV8-encoded vMIP-l selectively engages chemokine receptor CCR5. Agonist and antagonist profiles of viral chemokines., J. Biol. Chem. 1999 Jul 30; 274(31): 21569-74 and Gosling J, et al., Cutting edge: identification of a novel chemokine receptor that binds dendritic cell- and T cell-active chemokines including ELC, SLC, and TECK., J. Immunol. 2000 Mar 15; 164(6):2851-6 was used.<br>
[00404]	In these assays, MCF-7 cells were interrogated with the target<br>
compounds and the ability of these compounds to displace 1251 radiolabeled SDF-1 was assessed using the protocol described in Dairaghi and Gosling. The target compounds were added to the plate to the indicated concentration and were then incubated with cells followed by the addition of radiolabeled chemokine (125l SDF-1) for 3 hr at 4°C in the following binding medium (25 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCI, 1 mM CaCI2, 5 mM MgCI2 and 0.2% bovine serum albumin, adjusted to pH 7.1). All assays were then incubated for 3 hrs at 4° C with gentle agitation. Following incubation in all binding assays, reactions were aspirated onto PEI-treated GF/B glass filters (Packard) using a cell harvester (Packard) and washed twice (25 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCI, 1 mM CaCI2, 5 mM - MgCI2, adjusted to pH 7.1). "Scintillant (MicroScint 10, Packard) was added to the wells, and the filters were counted in a Packard Topcount<br><br>
scintillation counter. Data were analyzed and plotted using Prism (GraphPad Prism version 3.0a for Macintosh, GraphPad Software, www.graphpad.com).<br>
Inhibition of cell proliferation in vitro.<br>
[00405]        Antagonism of CCXCKR2 expressed on a mammary carcinoma by small molecular weight compounds inhibited cell proliferation in vitro. Cells treated in vitro exhibited reduced cell growth over time as compared to untreated controls.<br>
Inhibition of cell adhesion in vitro.<br>
[00406]        In vitro static adhesion assays are used to model the events of leukocyte migration, including the adhesion of cells and subsequent emigration into a given tissue. Monolayers of vascular endothelial cells were grown on a surface, and cells expressing CCXCKR2 were labeled with a fluorescent dye to enable visualization. Experiments showed that the presence of CCXCKR2 expressing cells adhered to an endothelial layer encouraged adhesion of additional CCXCKR2 expressing cells as compared to control groups in which CCXCKR2 was not expressed. Additionally, the addition of a CCXCKR2 modulator inhibited adhesion as compared to a vehicle-treated control group.<br>
Inhibition of tumor formation in vivo.<br>
[00407]        Immunodeficient mice were injected with human B cell lymphoma cells expressing CCXCKR2. Treatment of those mice with CCXCKR2 modulators inhibited the ability of vascularized tumors to form. In one study, only one of 17 mice treated with a CCXCKR2 antagonist developed an encapsulated, vascularized tumor, while 11 of 17 mice in a vehicle control group developed encapsulated, vascularized tumor.<br>
Reduction of tumor volume in vivo.<br><br>
[00408]        Immunodeficient mice were injected with a human mammary carcinoma. Tumor measurements were made three times a week and tumor volume was determined. Mice treated with a CCXCKR2 modulator exhibited reduced tumor volumes as compared to mice in the vehicle control group.<br>
