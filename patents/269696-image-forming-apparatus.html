				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
IMAGE FORMING APPARATUS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to image forming<br>
apparatuses, and particularly to an image forming apparatus<br>
capable of providing stable image quality when an expendable<br>
supply, such as ink, an inkjet head, or a recording medium,<br>
that is not a specific expendable supply is used.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In an inkjet recording apparatus, which is an<br>
example of image forming apparatuses including printers,<br>
facsimile machines, and copy machines, a liquid discharge head<br>
is used as a recording head. The liquid discharge head<br>
discharges ink as a recording liquid onto a sheet to form<br>
(i.e., record, print, or transcribe) an image. The "sheet"<br>
herein is not limited to a sheet of paper but it includes any<br>
medium onto which a droplet of ink or other liquid can attach.<br>
Thus, the sheet may also be referred to as a "recorded<br>
medium," a "recording medium," a "recording paper," or a<br>
"recording sheet."<br>
In such an image forming apparatus, a user may<br>
use ink other than a specific ink, such as a manufacturer's<br><br>
designated ink, a "recommended" ink, or a "genuine" ink.<br>
While this can be a cause for troubles such as image defect or<br>
failure, some users prefer non-genuine products for cost-<br>
reducing purposes, aware of the potential troubles that the<br>
non-specific item may cause. Some other users may purchase<br>
and use non-genuine products without knowing it. Technologies<br>
for preventing the use of products other than a specific<br>
product are proposed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Applications<br>
No. 2000-326518 and 2004-188635; Japanese Patent No. 3095008;<br>
and Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 2001-075455.<br>
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 2006-<br>
276709 discloses an image forming apparatus in which use of a<br>
non-genuine product can be appropriately reflected in leasing<br>
charge. Japanese Laid-Open Patent Applications No. 2005-<br>
288845 and 2005-193522 disclose image forming apparatuses in<br>
which, instead of restricting a printing operation, a<br>
maintenance operation is performed to prevent failure or other<br>
troubles upon detection of use of a non-genuine product.<br>
Although measures have been taken from the<br>
maintenance aspect as mentioned above in response to the use<br>
of non-specific products, no consideration is given with<br>
regard to the quality of an output image. As a practical<br>
matter, differences in ink material may lead to problems such<br>
as a failure to discharge an intended amount of ink, or a drop<br>
in landing position accuracy. Furthermore, because the amount<br><br>
of ink that a sheet can absorb varies depending on the type of<br>
ink, the probability of image quality deterioration such as<br>
beading increases when an excessive amount of ink attaches to<br>
the sheet.<br>
In some inkjet printers, a recording head and an<br>
ink tank are integrated. In this case, a user may also use a<br>
recording head other than a specific head, such as one<br>
recommended by the manufacturer. If that happens, an intended<br>
amount of ink may not be discharged, or landing position<br>
accuracy may decrease.<br>
Another example of the potential use of a non-<br>
specific product is the recording media (such as a sheet of<br>
paper). Many users are unaware of the characteristics of a<br>
recording medium they print on. Many users also tend to<br>
select non-specific recording media, which may be called a<br>
"glossy sheet," a "photographic sheet," or a "high-quality<br>
paper," simply because they are less expensive. In such a<br>
case too, because different sheets have different ink<br>
absorption amounts, excessive ink attachment may occur,<br>
resulting in beading or other image quality degradation.<br>
Because such various recording media also have different<br>
thicknesses, it may become impossible to cause an ink droplet<br>
to become attached to a target landing position.<br><br>
Thus, the image quality may greatly drop below<br>
the optimum quality when even any one of the factors of ink,<br>
recording head, and recording medium is changed.<br>
It is therefore a general object of the present<br>
invention to overcome the aforementioned problems. A more<br>
specific object is to provide an image forming apparatus<br>
capable of producing a high-quality image even when an<br>
expendable supply such as ink, a recording head, or a<br>
recording medium that is not a specific product is used.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides an<br>
image forming apparatus configured to move a recording head<br>
including plural nozzles in a horizontal scan direction in<br>

when the accumulated amount of the ink used is greater than a<br>
specific amount.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the automatic<br>
detection unit is configured to examine the recording head and<br>
identify a unique ID stored in a storage unit provided in the<br>
recording head. The automatic detection unit detects that the<br>
recording head is not a specific expendable supply when the<br>
unique ID does not correspond to a specific ID at the start of<br>
recording.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the automatic<br>
detection unit is configured to examine a transport path in<br>
which a sensor for detecting a thickness of the recording<br>
medium is provided. The automatic detection unit detects that<br>
the recording medium is not a specific expendable supply when<br>
the thickness detected by the sensor at the start of recording<br>
is not within a specific range of values.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the automatic<br>
detection unit is configured to examine a transport path in<br>
which a sensor for detecting a basis weight of the recording<br>
medium is provided. The automatic detection unit detects that<br><br>
the recording medium is not a specific expendable supply when<br>
the basis weight detected by the sensor at the start of<br>
recording is not within a specific range of values.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the changing of the<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
In the following, an inkjet recording apparatus,<br>
which is an image forming apparatus, according to an<br>
embodiment of the invention is described with reference to the<br>
drawings.<br>
FIGs. 1 and 2 show the image forming apparatus,<br>
which outputs image data generated by an image processing<br>
method according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 1 shows a side view of a mechanism portion of the image<br>
forming apparatus. FIG. 2 shows a plan view of the mechanism<br>
portion.<br>
The image forming apparatus according to the<br>
present embodiment includes a carriage 3 supported by a guide<br>
rod 1 and a guide rail 2 in such a manner as to be slidable in<br>
a horizontal scan direction. The guide rod 1 and the guide<br>
rail 2 are guide members laterally mounted on the left- and<br>
right-side plates (not shown). The carriage 3 is moved in the<br>
directions indicated by arrows in FIG. 2 (horizontal scan<br><br>
direction) by a horizontal scan motor 4, via a timing belt 5<br>
extended between a drive pulley 6A and a driven pulley 6B.<br>
The carriage 3 may carry four recording heads 7y,<br>
7c, 7m, and 7k (which may be referred to collectively as a<br>
"recording head 7" when no distinctions are made between the<br>
individual colors). These recording heads are liquid<br>
discharge heads for discharging ink droplets of yellow (Y),<br>
cyan (C), magenta (M), and black (K). The individual ink<br>
discharge openings of the four recording heads 7y, 7c, 7m, and<br>
7k may be arranged in a direction perpendicular to the<br>
horizontal scan direction, with the direction of ink discharge<br>
facing downward.<br>
Each of the liquid discharge heads, of which the<br>
recording head 7 is composed, has a pressure generator for<br>
generating the pressure for discharging a droplet. Examples<br>
of the pressure generator include a piezoelectric actuator; a<br>
thermal actuator that utilizes a phase change caused by liquid<br>
film boiling produced by an electric-thermal conversion<br>
element, such as a heating resistor; a shape-memory alloy<br>
actuator utilizing a metal phase change due to temperature<br>
change; or an electrostatic actuator utilizing electrostatic<br>
force. The individual head units provided for the individual<br>
colors are merely an example. In another embodiment, the<br>
recording head 7 may consist of one or more liquid discharge<br><br>
head units having a line of nozzles for discharging droplets<br>
of multiple colors.<br>
The carriage 3 also carries sub-tanks 8 for<br>
supplying ink of individual colors to the recording head 7.<br>
To each of the sub-tanks 8, ink is supplied via an ink supply<br>
tube 9 from a main tank (ink cartridge), which is not shown.<br>
While in the present embodiment ink is supplied from the<br>
external main tanks, this is merely an example. In another<br>
embodiment, the ink cartridges may be mounted at the position<br>
of the sub-tanks 8.<br>
The image forming apparatus further includes a<br>
sheet feeding unit for supplying a sheet 12 placed on a sheet<br>
tray 11, such as a sheet-feeding cassette 10. The sheet<br>
feeding unit includes a half-moon shaped roller (sheet-feeding<br>
roller) 13 for picking up and sending the sheet 12 from the<br>
sheet tray 11, one sheet at a time. The sheet feeding unit<br>
also includes a separating pad 14 disposed opposite the sheet-<br>
feeding roller 13. The separating pad 14, which is made of<br>
material with a large friction coefficient, is biased toward<br>
the sheet-feeding roller 13.<br>
In order to transport the sheet 12 fed by the<br>
sheet feeding unit under the recording head 7, there are<br>
provided a transfer belt 21 for transporting the sheet 12<br>
using electrostatic adsorption; a counter roller 22 for<br>
transporting the sheet 12, as it is fed from the sheet feeding<br><br>
unit via a guide 15, between the counter roller 22 and a<br>
transfer belt 21; a transport guide 23 for changing the<br>
direction of the sheet 12 by substantially 90°, so that the<br>
sheet 12 can follow along the transfer belt 21; and a holddown<br>
roller 25 that is biased toward the transfer belt 21 by a<br>
holddown member 24. There is also provided a charge roller 26<br>
for charging the surface of the transfer belt 21.<br>
The transfer belt 21 is an endless belt extended<br>
between a transfer roller 27 and a tension roller 28. As the<br>
transfer roLler 27 is rotated by a vertical scan motor 31 via<br>
a timing belt 32 and a timing roller 33, the transfer belt 21<br>
turns in a belt transport direction (vertical scan direction)<br>
indicated by an arrow in FIG. 2. Facing the back side of the<br>
transfer belt 21, a guide member 29 is disposed at a location<br>
corresponding to an image formation region of the recording<br>
head 7. The charge roller 26 is in contact with the surface<br>
layer of the transfer belt 21 so that it can rotate in<br>
accordance with the turning of the transfer belt 21.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, a disc 34 having slits is<br>
attached to the shaft of the transfer roller 27. A sensor 35<br>
is provided to detect the slits of the disc 34. The disc 34<br>
and the sensor 35 form a rotary encoder 36.<br>
The image forming apparatus further includes a<br>
paper ejection unit for ejecting the sheet 12 that has been<br>
recorded by the recording head 7. The paper ejection unit<br><br>
comprises a separating nail 51 for separating the sheet 12<br>
from the transfer belt 21; paper ejection rollers 52 and 53;<br>
and an ejected paper tray 54 for stocking the ejected sheet<br>
12.<br>
In a back portion, a both-side sheet-feeding unit<br>
61 is detachably attached. The both-side sheet-feeding unit<br>
61 is configured to take the sheet 12 as it is returned by the<br>
rotation of the transfer belt 21 in the opposite direction,<br>
invert the sheet 12, and then feed it again between the<br>
counter roller 22 and the transfer belt 21.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, in a non-printing region on<br>
one side of the carriage 3 along the horizontal scan<br>
direction, a maintain/recover mechanism 56 for maintaining or<br>
recovering the condition of the nozzles of the recording head<br>
7 is disposed.<br>
This maintain/recover mechanism 56 includes caps<br>
57 for capping the nozzle surface of each of the recording<br>
heads 7, a wiper blade 58 which is a blade member for wiping<br>
the nozzle surface, and a blank discharge receiver 59 for<br>
receiving droplets when performing a blank discharge involving<br>
the discharge of droplets that do not contribute to recording<br>
for the purpose of ejecting recording fluid having increased<br>
viscosity.<br>
In the thus constructed image forming apparatus,<br>
the sheet 12 is fed from the sheet feeding unit one by one.<br><br>
The sheet 12 is guided by the guide 15 substantially<br>
vertically upwardly and then transferred sandwiched between<br>
the transfer belt 21 and the counter roller 22. The tip of<br>
the sheet 12 is guided by the transport guide 23, and the<br>
sheet 12 is held down onto the transfer belt 21 by the<br>
holddown roller 25, whereby the direction of transport is<br>
changed by substantially 90°.<br>
A control unit (not shown) causes an AC bias<br>
supply unit to apply an alternating voltage which alternates<br>
between positive and negative levels to the charge roller 26.<br>
As a result, the transfer belt 21 is charged with an<br>
alternating charge voltage pattern in which positive and<br>
negative levels appear alternately at predetermined individual<br>
durations in the rotating direction, i.e., the vertical scan<br>
direction. When the sheet 12 is fed onto the thus charged<br>
transfer belt 21, the sheet 12 is adsorbed onto the transfer<br>
belt 21 by electrostatic force, so that the sheet 12 can be<br>
transported in the vertical scan direction as the transfer<br>
belt 21 rotates.<br>
The recording head 7 is driven in accordance with<br>
an image signal while the carriage 3 is moved in the forward<br>
or the backward direction, whereby ink droplets are discharged<br>
onto the stationary sheet 12, thus recording one line of data.<br>
The sheet 12 is then moved a predetermined distance, followed<br>
by the recording of the next line. Upon reception of a record<br><br>
end signal or a signal indicating that the bottom end of the<br>
sheet 12 has reached the recording region, the recording<br>
operation is stopped, and the sheet 12 is ejected to the<br>
ejected paper tray 54.<br>
In the case of a both-side printing, the transfer<br>
belt 21 is rotated in the opposite direction upon completion<br>
of the recording on the upper surface (which is initially<br>
printed). Thereby, the recorded sheet 12 is sent into the<br>
both-side sheet-feeding unit 61, in which the sheet 12 is<br>
inverted (so that the back surface is made the printed<br>
surface). Thereafter, the sheet 12 is again fed between the<br>
counter roller 22 and the transfer belt 21, carried on the<br>
transfer belt 21 while timing control is performed. The sheet<br>
is recorded on the back surface in the same way as described<br>
above, and finally ejected onto the ejected paper tray 54.<br>
During a print (record) standby period, the<br>
carriage 3 is moved toward the maintain/recover mechanism 55,<br>
where the nozzle surfaces of the recording head 7 are capped<br>
with the caps 57 so that the nozzles can maintain their wet<br>
condition to thereby prevent discharge failure due to the<br>
drying of ink. Further, with the recording head 7 capped with<br>
the caps 57, a recovery operation may be performed in which<br>
the recording fluid is sucked out of the nozzles in order to<br>
discharge the recording fluid having increased viscosity or<br>
bubbles. This is followed by wiping with the wiper blade 58,<br><br>
whereby the ink that has become attached to the nozzle<br>
surfaces of the recording head 7 due to the recovery operation<br>
is cleared or removed. Before or during recording, a blank<br>
discharge operation may be performed in which ink that does<br>
not contribute to recording is discharged. In this way, a<br>
stable discharge performance of the recording head 7 is<br>
maintained.<br>
Hereafter, an example of the liquid discharge<br>
head, i.e., the recording head 7, is described with reference<br>
to FIGs. 3 and 4. FIG. 3 shows a cross section of the head<br>
taken along the longer direction of a fluid chamber. FIG. 4<br>
shows a cross section taken in the shorter direction of the<br>
fluid chamber (along which the nozzles are arranged).<br>
The liquid discharge head includes a channel<br>
plate 101, which may be formed by anisotropic etching of a<br>
single-crystal silicon substrate. A vibrating plate 102,<br>
which may be formed by nickel electroforming, is joined to a<br>
bottom surface of the channel plate 101. A nozzle plate 103<br>
is joined to an upper surface of the channel plate 101. In<br>
these laminated layers, there are formed a nozzle<br>
communication passage 105 with which a nozzle 104 for<br>
discharging an ink droplet is in fluid communication; a fluid<br>
chamber 106 which is a pressure generating chamber; and an ink<br>
supply opening 109 with which a common fluid chamber 108 is in<br>
fluid communication in order to supply ink to the fluid<br><br>
chamber 106 via a fluid resistance portion (supply passage)<br>
107.<br>
The liquid discharge head also includes two lines<br>
of laminated piezoelectric elements 121 (In FIG. 4, only one<br>
line of the laminated piezoelectric element 121 is shown).<br>
The laminated piezoelectric element 121 is an<br>
electromechanical transducer element as a pressure generator<br>
(actuator unit) configured to deform the vibrating plate 102<br>
in order to apply pressure to the ink in the fluid chamber<br>
106. The piezoelectric element 121 is fixed to a base<br>
substrate 122. Between the piezoelectric elements 121, a<br>
support portion 123 is provided. The support portion 123 is<br>
formed simultaneously with the piezoelectric elements 121 by<br>
dividing the piezoelectric element material. Because no drive<br>
voltage is applied to the support portion 123, it merely<br>
functions as a support.<br>
To the piezoelectric element 121, a flexible<br>
printed circuit board (FPC) cable 126 equipped with a drive<br>
circuit (drive IC), not shown, is connected.<br>
A peripheral portion of the vibrating plate 102<br>
is joined to a frame member 130. In the frame member 130,<br>
there are formed a bored portion 131 for housing the actuator<br>
unit including the piezoelectric element 121 and the base<br>
substrate 122; a depressed portion for the common fluid<br>
chamber 108; and an ink supply opening 132 for supplying<br><br>
external color ink to the common fluid chamber 108. The frame<br>
member 130 may be formed by injection molding of a<br>
thermosetting resin, such as epoxy resin or polyphenylene<br>
sulfide.<br>
The depressions or openings in the channel plate<br>
101, such as the nozzle communication passage 105 and the<br>
fluid chamber 106, may be formed by anisotropic etching of a<br>
single-crystal silicon substrate having the crystal face<br>
orientation (110), using an alkaline etching solution, such as<br>
an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH). However,<br>
the substrate is not limited to a single-crystal silicon<br>
substrate but may be a stainless substrate or a photosensitive<br>
resin.<br>
The vibrating plate 102 may be made of a nickel<br>
metal plate by electroforming process. In another embodiment,<br>
the vibrating plate 102 may be made of other types of metal<br>
plate, or of a metal-resin composite material. To the<br>
vibrating plate 102, the piezoelectric elements 121 and the<br>
support portion 123 are bonded with adhesive. The frame<br>
member 130 is also bonded to the vibrating plate 102 with<br>
adhesive.<br>
The nozzle plate 103 has the nozzle 104 formed<br>
therein for each fluid chamber 106, with a diameter of 10 to<br>
30 urn. The nozzle plate 103 is bonded to the channel plate<br>
101 with adhesive. The nozzle plate 103 is made of a metal<br><br>
nozzle forming member on the outer-most surface of which a<br>
water-repellent layer is formed via any required layers.<br>
The piezoelectric element 121 is a piezoelectric<br>
transducer (PZT) consisting of a piezoelectric material 151<br>
and internal electrodes 152 that are alternately laminated.<br>
The internal electrodes 152 are drawn out of the piezoelectric<br>
element 121 via alternately different end faces thereof, and<br>
are connected to an individual electrode 153 or a common<br>
electrode 154. In the present embodiment, the piezoelectric<br>
element 121 employs displacement in the d33 direction as the<br>
piezoelectric direction in order to apply pressure to the ink<br>
in the fluid chamber 10 6. Alternatively, displacement in the<br>
d31 direction may be employed as the piezoelectric direction<br>
of the piezoelectric element 121 in order to apply pressure to<br>
the ink in the fluid chamber 106. In another embodiment, one<br>
line of the piezoelectric element 121 may be provided on a<br>
single substrate 122.<br>
In the thus constructed liquid discharge head,<br>
when the voltage applied to the piezoelectric element 121 is<br>
lowered below a reference potential, the piezoelectric element<br>
121 contracts, whereby the vibrating plate 102 moves downward.<br>
As a result, the volume of the fluid chamber 106 expands,<br>
causing ink to flow into the fluid chamber 106. Thereafter,<br>
the voltage applied to the piezoelectric element 121 is<br>
increased in order to cause the piezoelectric element 121 to<br><br>
extend in the laminated direction, thereby deforming the<br>
vibrating plate 102 in the direction of the nozzle 104. As a<br>
result, the volume of the fluid chamber 10 6 decreases, whereby<br>
the recording fluid in the fluid chamber 106 is pressurized<br>
and discharged (ejected) out of the nozzle 104 in the form of<br>
a droplet.<br>
By bringing the voltage applied to the<br>
piezoelectric element 121 back to the reference potential, the<br>
vibrating plate 102 returns to its initial position, whereby<br>
the fluid chamber 106 expands and a negative pressure is<br>
generated. The negative pressure causes the fluid chamber 106<br>
to be filled with the recording fluid from the common fluid<br>
chamber 108. After the vibration of the meniscus surface at<br>
the nozzle 104 dampens to a stable state, an operation for the<br>
discharge of the next droplet is initiated.<br>
The above (pull-push discharge process) is merely<br>
an example of the method of driving the head. A pull<br>
discharge or a push discharge process may be employed<br>
depending on the way a drive waveform is given.<br>
Hereafter, the control unit of the image forming<br>
apparatus is described with reference to a block diagram shown<br>
in FIG. 5.<br>
The control unit 200 includes a central<br>
processing unit (CPU) 201 for controlling the apparatus as a<br>
whole; a read-only memory (ROM) for storing a program executed<br><br>
by the CPU 201 and other fixed data; a random access memory<br>
(RAM) 203 which may temporarily store image data; a rewritable<br>
nonvolatile memory 204 for retaining data when power to the<br>
apparatus is turned off; and an application-specific<br>
integrated circuit (ASIC) 205 for performing various signal<br>
processes on image data, image processing for data<br>
rearrangement, and an input/output signal processing for<br>
controlling the apparatus as a whole.<br>
The control unit 200 also includes an interface<br>
(I/F) 206 for exchanging data and signals with a host; a data<br>
transfer unit for driving and controlling the recording head<br>
7; a print control unit 207 including a drive waveform<br>
generating unit for generating a drive waveform; a head<br>
driver (driver IC) 208 for driving the recording head 7<br>
mounted on the carriage 3; a motor drive unit 210 for driving<br>
the horizontal scan motor 4 and the vertical scan motor 31; an<br>
AC bias supply unit 212 for supplying an AC bias to the charge<br>
roller 34; and an input/output (I/O) unit 213 for the input of<br>
detection signals from various sensors such as encoder sensors<br>
43 and 35 and a temperature sensor for detecting ambient<br>
temperature. Further, an operating panel 214 for the input<br>
and display of necessary information is connected to the<br>
control unit 200.<br>
The control unit 200 receives image data from a<br>
host via the I/F 206. The host may be an information<br><br>
processing apparatus such as a personal computer, an image<br>
reading apparatus such as an image scanner, or an imaging<br>
device such as a digital camera, connected via a cable or a<br>
network.<br>
The CPU 201 of the control unit 200 reads and<br>
analyzes print data in a reception buffer included in the I/F<br>
206, performs necessary image processing in the ASIC 205 in<br>
order to rearrange the data, for example, and then transfers<br>
the image data from the head drive control unit 207 to the<br>
head driver 208. The generation of dot pattern data for the<br>
output of an image is performed by a printer driver on the<br>
host end, as will be described later.<br>
The print control unit 207 transfers the<br>
aforementioned image data to the head driver 208 in the form<br>
of serial data. The print control unit 207 also outputs to<br>
the head driver 208 a transfer clock and a latch signal, which<br>
are necessary for transfer of image data and for finalizing<br>
transfer, and a drop control signal (mask signal). The print<br>
control unit 207 also includes a drive waveform generating<br>
unit including a D/A converter for D/A converting drive signal<br>
pattern data stored in the ROM, a voltage amplifier, and a<br>
current amplifier. The print control unit 207 further<br>
includes a drive waveform selection unit for selecting a drive<br>
waveform to be fed to the head driver. Using these units, the<br>
print control unit 207 generates a drive waveform consisting<br><br>
of one or more drive pulses (drive signals) and outputs the<br>
drive waveform to the head driver 208.<br>
The head driver 208, based on the serially fed<br>
image data corresponding to one line to be recorded with the<br>
recording head 7, drives the recording head 7 by selectively<br>
applying a drive signal corresponding to the drive waveform<br>
fed from the print control unit 207 to the drive elements<br>
(such as the aforementioned piezoelectric elements) for<br>
generating the energy for causing the discharge of droplets<br>
out of the recording head 7. By selecting an appropriate<br>
drive pulse of which the drive waveform is composed, dots<br>
having various sizes, such as large, medium, or small dots,<br>
can be discharged.<br>
A speed detection value and a position detection<br>
value are obtained by sampling a detection pulse from the<br>
encoder sensor 43, which is a linear encoder. A target speed<br>
value and a target position value are obtained from a pre-<br>
stored speed/position profile. Based on these values, the CPU<br>
201 calculates a drive output value (control value) and then<br>
drives the horizontal scan motor 4 via the motor drive unit<br>
210 based on the control value. Similarly, a speed detection<br>
value and a position detection value are obtained by sampling<br>
a detection pulse from the encoder sensor 35, which is a<br>
rotary encoder. A target speed value and a target position<br>
value are obtained from a pre-stored speed/position profile.<br><br>
Based on these values, the CPU 201 calculates a drive output<br>
value (control value), and then drives the vertical scan motor<br>
31 via the motor drive unit 210 and a motor driver based on<br>
the control value.<br>
Hereafter, an image forming system according to<br>
an embodiment of the present invention is described with<br>
reference to FIG. 6. The system includes one or more image<br>
processing apparatuses 400 and an inkjet printer 500 (inkjet<br>
recording apparatus) corresponding to the aforementioned image<br>
forming apparatus.<br>
The image processing apparatus 400, which may be<br>
a personal computer (PC), and the inkjet printer 500 are<br>
connected via a predetermined interface or a network.<br>
The image processing apparatus 4 00 includes a CPU<br>
401 and various memory units, such as a ROM 402 and a RAM 403,<br>
which are connected by a bus line, as shown in FIG. 7.<br>
Various units are connected to the bus line via predetermined<br>
interfaces, such as a storage unit 406 which may consist of a<br>
magnetic storage unit such as a hard disk; an input device 404<br>
such as a mouse or a keyboard; a monitor 405 such as a liquid<br>
crystal display (LCD) or a cathode-ray tube (CRT) display; and<br>
a storage medium reading device (not shown) for reading a<br>
storage medium such as an optical disc. A predetermined<br>
interface (external I/F) unit 407 for communication with an<br><br>
external network such as the Internet or an external device<br>
via USB connection is also connected to the bus line.<br>
The storage unit 406 of the image processing<br>
apparatus 4 00 stores an image processing program. The image<br>
processing program may be read from a storage medium using the<br>
storage medium reading device, or downloaded from a network<br>
such as the Internet, and then installed on the storage unit<br>
406. By thus installing the image processing program, the<br>
image processing apparatus 400 is enabled to perform image<br>
processing as described below. The image processing program<br>
may be adapted to operate on a predetermined operating system<br>
(OS). The image processing program may also constitute a part<br>
of particular application software.<br>
With reference to a functional block diagram<br>
shown in FIG. 8, an image processing method using the program<br>
on the part of the image processing apparatus 400 according to<br>
an embodiment of the present invention is described.<br>
This is an example in which most of imaging<br>
processes are carried out by a host computer such as a<br>
personal computer (PC) functioning as an image processing<br>
apparatus, as is suitable in the case of a relatively low-cost<br>
Inkjet recording apparatus.<br>
A printer driver 411 includes the program stored<br>
in the image processing apparatus 400 (PC). The printer<br>
driver 411 includes a color management module (CMM) processing<br><br>
unit 412 for converting image data 410, which may be fed from<br>
application software, from a color space for monitor display<br>
into a color space for a recording apparatus, such as an image<br>
forming apparatus (i.e., from the RGB color system to the CMY<br>
color system); a black generation/under color removal (BG/UCR)<br>
processing unit 413 for black generation and under color<br>
removal from the CMY values; a γ correction processing unit<br>
414 for correction of recording apparatus characteristics or<br>
input/output correction to suit a user's preferences; a<br>
halftone processing unit 415 for performing a halftone process<br>
on image data; a dot arrangement processing unit 416 (which<br>
may be incorporated into the halftone processing unit) for<br>
converting the result of halftone processing into a pattern<br>
arrangement corresponding to the order of ejection of dots<br>
from the recording apparatus; and a rasterizing unit 417 for<br>
spreading the dot pattern data, i.e., the print image data<br>
obtained by the halftone processing and the dot arrangement<br>
processing, in accordance with the print nozzle positions. An<br>
output 418 of the rasterizing unit 417 is delivered to the<br>
inkjet printer 500.<br>
Hereafter, an example of performing part of the<br>
image processing according to the present embodiment on the<br>
part of the inkjet printer 500 is described with reference to<br>
a functional block diagram shown in FIG. 9.<br><br>
This example enables high-speed processing, and<br>
may be suitably used in high-speed machines.<br>
A printer driver 421 on the part of the image<br>
processing apparatus 400 (PC) includes a CMM processing unit<br>
422 for converting image data 410, which may be fed from<br>
application software, from a color space for monitor display<br>
into a color space for a recording apparatus (i.e., from the<br>
RGB color system to the CMY color system); a BG/UCR processing<br>
unit 423 for black generation and under color removal from the<br>
CMY values; and a y correction processing unit 424 for<br>
correction of recording apparatus characteristics or<br>
input/output correction to suit a user's preferences. Image<br>
data generated by the y correction processing unit 424 is<br>
delivered to the inkjet printer 500.<br>
A printer controller 511 (control unit 200) on<br>
the part of the inkjet printer 500 includes a halftone<br>
processing unit 415 for performing a halftone processing on<br>
image data; a dot arrangement processing unit 416 (which may<br>
be incorporated into the halftone processing unit) for<br>
converting the result of halftone processing into a pattern<br>
arrangement corresponding to the order of ejection of dots<br>
from the recording apparatus; and a rasterizing unit 517 for<br>
spreading the print image data, i.e., the dot pattern data<br>
obtained by the halftone processing and the dot arrangement<br>
processing, in accordance with the individual nozzle<br><br>
positions. The output of the rasterizing unit 517 is<br>
delivered to the print control unit 207.<br>
The image processing method according to the<br>
present embodiment of the invention may be implemented by<br>
either the configuration of FIG. 8 or FIG. 9. In the<br>
following, reference is made to the configuration of FIG. 8,<br>
in which the Inkjet recording apparatus does not have the<br>
function to generate a dot pattern that is actually recorded<br>
in response to a print instruction to draw an image or a<br>
character. Thus, a print instruction, which may be sent from<br>
application software executed by the image processing<br>
apparatus 400 as a host, is subjected to image processing by<br>
the printer driver 411, which is provided in the image<br>
processing apparatus 400 (host computer) in the form of<br>
software. The resultant multiple-value dot pattern data<br>
(print image data) that the inkjet printer 500 can output is<br>
then rasterized and transferred to the inkjet printer 500,<br>
which produces a printed output.<br>
Specifically, in the image processing apparatus<br>
400, an image-drawing or character-recording instruction from<br>
an application or the operating system (describing, e.g., the<br>
position, thickness, and shape of a line to be recorded, or<br>
the font and position of a character to be recorded) is<br>
temporarily saved in a rendering data memory. Such an<br>
instruction may be described in a particular print language.<br><br>
The instruction saved in the rendering data<br>
memory is interpreted by the rasterizer. If it is a line-<br>
recording instruction, it is converted into a recording dot<br>
pattern corresponding to a designated position or thickness.<br>
If the instruction is a character-recording instruction, it is<br>
converted into a recording dot pattern corresponding to a<br>
designated position or size based on corresponding character<br>
profile information which is recalled from font outline data<br>
stored in the image processing apparatus (host computer) 400.<br>
In the case of image data, the data is converted into a<br>
recording dot pattern as is.<br>
Thereafter, the recording dot pattern (image data<br>
410) is image-processed and then stored in the raster data<br>
memory. Specifically, the image processing apparatus 400<br>
rasterizes the data into recording dot pattern data with<br>
reference to orthogonal grids as reference recording<br>
positions. The image processing includes a color management<br>
module (CMM) processing for color adjustment; γ correction<br>
processing; halftone processing using a dither method or an<br>
error diffusion method; an underlayer eliminating processing;<br>
and a total ink amount regulating processing, some of which<br>
have been mentioned above. The recording dot pattern stored<br>
in the raster data memory is transferred to the inkjet<br>
recording apparatus 500 via an interface.<br><br>
In the following, an image forming apparatus<br>
(multifunction peripheral) combining the function of an inkjet<br>
recording apparatus and a copier function is described with<br>
reference to FIG. 10. FIG. 10 shows an overall structure of<br>
the image forming apparatus.<br>
The image forming apparatus has an apparatus body-<br>
(casing) 1001 in which an image forming unit 1002 for forming<br>
an image and a vertical scan transfer unit 1003 (which may be<br>
collectively referred to as a printer engine unit) are<br>
disposed. At the bottom of the apparatus body 1001, there is<br>
provided a sheet feeding unit 1004, from which a recording<br>
medium (sheet) 1005 is taken one by one. The sheet 1005 is<br>
then transported by a vertical scan transfer unit 1003 to a<br>
position opposite an image forming unit 1002, where the image<br>
forming unit 1002 discharges ink droplets onto the sheet 1005<br>
to form (record) a required image. The sheet 1005 is then<br>
ejected onto an ejected paper tray 1007 formed at the top of<br>
the apparatus body 1001 via an ejected paper transfer unit<br>
1006.<br>
The image forming apparatus also includes an<br>
image reading unit (scanner unit) 1011 disposed above the<br>
ejected paper tray 1007 for reading an image. The image<br>
reading unit 1011, which is an input system for image data<br>
(print data) used by the image forming unit 1002, includes a<br>
scanning optical system 1015 including an illuminating light<br><br>
source 1013 and a mirror 1014, and another scanning optical<br>
system 1018 including mirrors 1016 and 1017. The scanning<br>
optical systems 1015 and 1018 are configured to move in order<br>
to acquire an image of a manuscript placed on a contact glass<br>
1012. The scanned manuscript image is then acquired as an<br>
image signal by an image reading element 1020 disposed behind<br>
a lens 1019. The acquired image signal is digitized and<br>
subjected to image processing, and the image-processed print<br>
data can be then printed. Over the contact glass 1012, a<br>
cover plate 1010 for holding a manuscript is attached.<br>
The image forming apparatus may be configured to<br>
receive data, such as print image data, from an external data<br>
input system, in order to input data for an image formed by<br>
the forming unit 1002. Examples of the external data input<br>
system include an information processing apparatus, such as a<br>
personal computer functioning as an image processing<br>
apparatus; an image reading device such as an image scanner;<br>
and an imaging device such as a digital camera. Such data<br>
including print image data delivered from a host may be<br>
received via a print cable or a network, processed, and then<br>
printed.<br>
The image forming unit 1002 is of the shuttle<br>
type. Specifically, the image forming unit 1002,<br>
substantially similar to the aforementioned inkjet recording<br>
apparatus (image forming apparatus), includes a carriage 1023<br><br>
adapted to be guided by a guide rod 1021 to move in the<br>
horizontal scan direction (perpendicular to the sheet<br>
transport direction). On the carriage 1023, there is disposed<br>
a recording head 1024 consisting of one or more liquid<br>
discharge heads, each of which has a line of nozzles for<br>
discharging droplets of multiple different colors. The<br>
recording head 1024 is configured to discharge droplets of ink<br>
while the carriage 1023 is moved by a carriage scan mechanism<br>
in the horizontal scan direction and while the sheet 1005 is<br>
transferred in the sheet transfer direction (vertical scan<br>
direction) by the vertical scan transfer unit 1003.<br>
Alternatively, the image forming unit 1002 may be of the line<br>
type equipped with a line head.<br>
To the line of nozzles on the recording head 1024<br>
for discharging droplets of black (Bk) ink, cyan(C) ink,<br>
magenta (M) ink, and yellow (Y) ink, ink of each color is<br>
supplied from a sub-tank 1025 mounted on the carriage 1023.<br>
The sub-tank 1025 is replenished with ink from an ink<br>
cartridge 1026 for each color, which is a main tank detachably<br>
attached in the apparatus body 1001, via tubing (not shown).<br>
The vertical scan transfer unit 1003 includes an<br>
endless transfer belt 1031 extended between a transfer roller<br>
1032, which is a drive roller, and a driven roller 1033, for<br>
changing the direction of transfer of the sheet 1005 as it is<br>
fed from below by substantially 90° toward the image forming<br><br>
unit 1002; a charge roller 1034 to which an AC bias is applied<br>
for charging the surface of the transfer belt 1031; a guide<br>
member 1035 for guiding the transfer belt 1031 in an area<br>
opposite the image forming unit 1002; a holddown roller<br>
(pressure roller) 1036 for holding down the sheet 1005 onto<br>
the transfer belt 1031 at a position opposite the transfer<br>
roller 1032; and a transfer roller 1037 for sending the sheet<br>
1005 on which an image has been formed by the image forming<br>
unit 1002 onto an ejected paper transfer unit 1006.<br>
The transfer belt 1031 of the vertical scan<br>
transfer unit 1003 rotates in the vertical scan direction as<br>
the transfer roller 1032 is rotated by a vertical scan motor<br>
1131 via a timing belt 1132 and a timing roller 1133.<br>
The sheet feeding unit 1004 includes a sheet-<br>
feeding cassette 1041 that can be inserted and removed from<br>
the apparatus body 1001, for storing a number of sheets 1005;<br>
a sheet-feeding roller 1042 and a friction pad 1043 for<br>
feeding the sheets 1005 from the sheet-feeding cassette 1041<br>
one sheet at a time; and a sheet-feeding transfer roller 1044<br>
which is a resist roller for transporting the sheet 1005 to<br>
the vertical scan transfer unit 1003. The sheet-feeding<br>
roller 1042 is rotated by a sheet-feeding motor 1141, which<br>
may be a hybrid (HB) stepping motor, via a sheet-feeding<br>
clutch (not shown). The sheet-feeding transfer roller 1044 is<br>
also rotated by the sheet-feeding motor 1141.<br><br>
The ejected paper transfer unit 1006 includes<br>
ejected paper transfer roller pairs 1061 and 1062 for<br>
transporting the sheet 1005 on which an image has been formed;<br>
and ejected paper transfer roller pairs 1063 and 1064 for<br>
sending the sheet 1005 out to the ejected paper tray 1007.<br>
In the following, a control unit 1200 of the<br>
image forming apparatus is described with reference to a block<br>
diagram shown in FIG. 11.<br>
The control unit 1200 includes a main control<br>
unit 1210 for controlling the apparatus as a whole. The main<br>
control unit 1210 includes a CPU 1201; a ROM 1202 for storing<br>
a program executed by the CPU 1201 and other fixed data; a RAM<br>
1203 for temporary storage of image data or the like; a<br>
nonvolatile memory (NVRAM) 1204 for retaining data while power<br>
to the apparatus is turned off; and an ASIC 1205 for<br>
performing image processing on an input image, such as<br>
halftone processing.<br>
The control unit 1200 also includes an external<br>
I/F 1211 disposed between a host, such as an information<br>
processing apparatus functioning as an image processing<br>
apparatus, and the main control unit 1210, in order to process<br>
the transmission and reception of data and signals; a print<br>
control unit 1212 that includes a head driver for driving and<br>
controlling the recording head 1024; a horizontal scan drive<br>
unit (motor driver) 1213 for driving the horizontal scan motor<br><br>
1027 by which the carriage 1023 is moved; a vertical scan<br>
drive unit 1214 for driving the vertical scan motor 1131; a<br>
sheet-feeding drive unit 1215 for driving the sheet-feeding<br>
motor 1141; a paper ejection drive unit 1216 for driving the<br>
paper ejection motor 1103 by which each roller in the paper<br>
ejection unit 1006 is driven; a both-side drive unit 1217 for<br>
driving a both-side refeeding motor 1104 by which each roller<br>
of a both-side unit (not shown) is driven; a recovery system<br>
drive unit 1218 for driving a maintain/recover motor 1105 by<br>
which the maintain/recover mechanism is driven; and an AC bias<br>
supply unit 1219 for supplying AC bias to the charge roller<br>
1034.<br>
The control unit 1200 further includes a<br>
solenoids drive unit (driver) 1222 for driving various types<br>
of solenoids (SOL) 1106; a clutch drive unit 1224 for driving<br>
electromagnetic clutches 1107 as they relate to feeding of<br>
sheets; and a scanner control unit 1225 for controlling the<br>
image reading unit 1011.<br>
To the main control unit 1210, a detection signal<br>
from a temperature sensor 1108 for detecting the temperature<br>
of the transfer belt 1031 is inputted. Though not shown,<br>
detection signals from various other sensors may also be<br>
inputted to the main control unit 1210. The main control unit<br>
1210 is also connected with an operating/display unit 1109 in<br>
order to receive necessary key inputs and output display<br><br>
information. The operation/display unit 1109 may include<br>
various keys such as a numerical keypad and a print start key<br>
and various indicators, which may be provided on the apparatus<br>
body 1001.<br>
The main control unit 1210 is also fed with an<br>
output signal (pulse) from a linear encoder 1101, which<br>
detects the speed and the amount of movement of the carriage<br>
1023, and an output signal (pulse) from a rotary encoder 1102<br>
for detecting the speed and the amount of movement of the<br>
transfer belt 1031. Based on these output signals and their<br>
correlation, the main control unit 1210 drives and controls<br>
the horizontal scan motor 1027 and the vertical scan motor<br>
1131 via the horizontal scan drive unit 1213 and the vertical<br>
scan drive unit 1214, respectively, thereby moving the<br>
carriage 1023 and causing the transfer belt 1031 to move to<br>
transport the sheet 1005.<br>
An image formation operation in the thus<br>
constructed image forming apparatus is briefly described. As<br>
the AC bias supply unit 1219 applies a rectangular-wave high<br>
voltage alternating between positive and negative poles to the<br>
charge roller 1034, which is in contact with an insulated<br>
layer (surface layer) of the transfer belt 1031, the surface<br>
layer of the transfer belt 1031 is charged with alternating<br>
bands of positive and negative charges in the transport<br>
direction of the transfer belt 1031. Thus, the surface of the<br><br>
transfer belt 1031 is charged with predetermined charge<br>
widths, thereby producing a non-uniform electric field.<br>
Then, the sheet 1005 is fed from the sheet<br>
feeding unit 1004 onto the transfer belt 1031 between the<br>
transfer roller 1032 and the holddown roller 1036. There,<br>
because the non-uniform electric field is present due to the<br>
formation of the positive- and negative-pole charges, the<br>
sheet 1005 is instantaneously polarized in accordance with the<br>
direction of the electric field. As a result, the sheet 1005<br>
is adsorbed on the transfer belt 1031 by the electrostatic<br>
force, and transported as the transfer belt 1031 moves.<br>
As the sheet 1005 is intermittently transported<br>
on the transfer belt 1031, droplets of recording fluid is<br>
discharged onto the sheet 1005 by the recording head 1024 in<br>
accordance with print data, whereby an image is formed<br>
(printed). Thereafter, the tip of the image-formed sheet 1005<br>
is separated from the transfer belt 1031 by the separating<br>
nail, and the sheet 1005 is ejected onto the ejected paper<br>
tray 1007 by the ejected paper transfer unit 1006.<br>
In accordance with an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, it is also possible to print a print medium such<br>
that no margin is provided in at least one of the edges. In<br>
this case, ink is inevitably discharged outside the print<br>
medium when printing an edge portion. This is due to the fact<br>
that even if ink is ejected in such a manner as to print just<br><br>
up to the edge of the print medium, the ink in reality often<br>
fails to land on an ideal landing position because of errors,<br>
such as feed error in the print medium transfer system or a<br>
drive error in the carriage, resulting in the creation of a<br>
margin. Consequently, it is necessary to print an area larger<br>
than is ideal, taking into consideration the print position<br>
errors, thereby resulting in the discharge of ink outside the<br>
print medium. The ink that misses the print medium does not<br>
contribute to recording and is therefore a waste of ink. In<br>
order to reduce such a waste ink as much as possible, a method<br>
is known whereby the transfer accuracy of the print medium is<br>
enhanced so that, by reducing the expected area in which the<br>
waste ink lands, the waste ink is reduced. For example,<br>
transfer accuracy may be improved by reducing the rate of feed<br>
of the print medium when printing its edge portion.<br>
When an expendable supply such as ink, a<br>
recording medium, or a recording head that is not a specific<br>
product, such as a recommended product, is used, problems such<br>
as beading and other various image quality degradations tend<br>
to occur because of inability to discharge an ink droplet<br>
normally or the difference in ink absorbing properties among<br>
different recording media, for example. Thus, users are<br>
encouraged to use specific expendable supplies, such as ones<br>
recommended by the manufacturer.<br><br>
Therefore, in an embodiment of the invention,<br>
upon detection of ink, a recording medium, or a recording head<br>
that is not a specific item, the user is notified that the<br>
currently selected expendable supply is not a specific item,<br>
and informed that switching to a specific expendable supply<br>
will result in better image quality. As long as the user<br>
switches to a suggested specific expendable supply, the user<br>
can be provided with a high quality image.<br>
Even when a specific expendable supply is not<br>
used, a stable quality image may be provided to a user by<br>
changing the image forming method, such as by selecting a more<br>
stable ink-droplet discharge method, or by adjusting the<br>
amount of droplet that becomes attached to the recording<br>
medium.<br>
In order to enable such a change of the method,<br>
the recording apparatus may be equipped with a dedicated mode<br>
for the case where a specific expendable supply is not used.<br>
Alternatively, it is also possible to accommodate such a<br>
change by modifying part of a standard image forming method<br>
(as will be described in detail later with reference to FIG.<br>
33). By thus allowing a user to select an appropriate output<br>
method, an output image that is more in line with the user's<br>
preferences can be provided.<br><br>
Whether the expendable supply is a specific<br>
expendable supply or not may be detected either automatically<br>
by the system or based on a user's manual input.<br>
In a method of automatically detecting ink that<br>
is not a specific product, the use period of an ink cartridge<br>
may be acquired from an IC chip attached to the cartridge.<br>
If the use period is excessively long, it is<br>
possible that the user has refilled the ink cartridge by<br>
himself. Alternatively, information about the accumulated<br>
amount of ink that has been used may be acquired from an IC<br>
chip attached to the cartridge. If the accumulated amount of<br>
ink used is greater than the original amount of ink in the ink<br>
cartridge, it is possible that the user has refilled the ink<br>
cartridge with ink by himself. In these cases, the use of a<br>
non-specific product can be detected.<br>
In a method of automatically detecting a<br>
recording head that is not a specific product, a unique ID of<br>
the recording head may be acquired from an IC chip attached to<br>
the recording head.<br>
In this case, a unique ID may be stored in the IC<br>
chip by a manufacturer upon shipping of the recording head. A<br>
recording apparatus acquires the unique ID at the start of<br>
recording, and determines whether the acquired ID corresponds<br>
to the manufacturer's designated ID. If not, the recording<br>
head can be detected as a non-specific product.<br><br>
In a method of automatically detecting a<br>
recording medium that is not a specific products, the<br>
thickness or the basis weight of the recording medium may be<br>
acquired.<br>
For example, a sensor may be provided in a<br>
transfer passage in a recording apparatus, in order to measure<br>
the thickness or the basis weight of a recording medium at the<br>
start of recording. If the obtained values are outside a<br>
specific range, which may be designated by the recording<br>
apparatus manufacturer, the recording medium can be detected<br>
as a non-specific product. For example, the thickness may be<br>
set in the range of from 90 to 110 μm, and the basis weight<br>
may be set in the range of between 50 to 250 g/m2, although<br>
the present invention is not limited by such ranges.<br>
By thus providing an automatic detection<br>
mechanism, it becomes possible to automatically provide a<br>
stable quality image to a user.<br>
In the case of a user's manual input, a switch or<br>
the like may be mounted on the exterior of the recording<br>
apparatus so that whether ink, a recording medium, and/or a<br>
recording head are specific products can be selected. In this<br>
way, a user can indicate whether any of the above items is a<br>
specific item. Alternatively, a check box or radio buttons<br>
may be provided in a print setting screen in a window of a PC<br>
or on a display unit of the recording apparatus, in order for<br><br>
the user to enter information indicating whether a certain<br>
element is a specific product or not. In this way, a user can<br>
confirm whether a certain item is a specific expendable<br>
supply.<br>
By thus providing a manual-input detecting<br>
mechanism, it becomes possible to provide a stable-quality<br>
image to the user without providing the aforementioned<br>
automatic detecting mechanism.<br>
In the following, the change of the image forming<br>
method in a case where a specific expendable supply is not<br>
used is described.<br>
Based on similarity in various means to obtain a<br>
high-quality image, the following four aspects are described<br>
in order.<br>
•	Improvement of landing position error (to prevent<br>
nonuniformity)<br>
•	Adjustment of attached ink amount (to prevent beading,<br>
cockeling, or transfer)<br>
•	Improvement of hue error (to achieve a certain specific hue)<br>
•	Ensuring ink drying time (to prevent beading, cockeling, or<br>
transfer)<br><br>
Of those four items, the initial three items<br>
relate to the change of the image forming method; the other<br>
one relates to a change in another operation.<br>
Improvement of landing position error<br>
In an actual image forming apparatus, a landing<br>
position error may be caused by various factors, resulting in<br>
image quality degradation. One of such factors is the<br>
discrepancy between the period of fluctuation of the meniscus<br>
and the print clock (i.e., the discharge timing).<br>
Specifically, if the meniscus is not stabilized within the<br>
duration between the discharge of an ink droplet and the<br>
discharge of the next ink droplet, a landing position error<br>
may occur due to abnormal discharge (see FIG. 12B).<br>
In accordance with an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the time for the meniscus to stabilize is ensured<br>
by reducing the speed of movement of the carriage. For<br>
example, by decreasing the speed of movement of the carriage<br>
below normal, a longer time can be provided between one<br>
discharge and the next, so that the meniscus can be stabilized<br>
in time. Thus, the landing position error can be reduced, and<br>
a high-quality image can be obtained (see FIG. 13B).<br>
The meniscus can also be stabilized by increasing<br>
the number of passes above normal. Specifically, as shown in<br>
FIG. 14B and 14C, by forming an image over plural passes, the<br><br>
intervals of time at which droplets are discharged<br>
successively in one scan can be extended, so that the meniscus<br>
can be stabilized. While the number of passes in the example<br>
of FIG. 14B and 14C is two, this is merely an example and the<br>
number may be greater than two.<br>
Nonuniformity can also be reduced by not using<br>
droplets with a large landing position error. For example, a<br>
large droplet (i.e., a droplet corresponding to a large dot<br>
size) and a small droplet (i.e., a droplet corresponding to a<br>
small dot size) have different energies required for discharge<br>
and also different weights.<br>
In the case of a small droplet, because it can be<br>
discharged with a very small energy, it is possible that a<br>
discharge cannot be performed in the absence of meniscus<br>
stability. Also, because its weight is small, the small<br>
droplet may become scattered and tend to land at an unintended<br>
position (see FIG. 15B). Thus, by forming an image in which<br>
gradation process is optimized with large or intermediate<br>
droplets, which have higher landing position accuracy, while<br>
avoiding small droplets, a high-quality image can be obtained<br>
(see FIG. 16B). When it is expected that the large and small<br>
droplets have low discharge stability, an image may be formed<br>
with intermediate droplets alone, thus suppressing the<br>
discharge of more than one kind of droplet.<br><br>
Nonuniformity can also be reduced by switching<br>
from a bidirectional printing to a one-directional printing.<br>
For example, when the thickness of a recording medium differs<br>
from a recommended value, or when the manner in which energy<br>
is applied to a droplet differs from a recommended manner, a<br>
landing position error may occur in the horizontal scan<br>
direction (see FIG. 17B). In this case, if a bidirectional<br>
printing is carried out, the printed position may differ<br>
between the forward direction and the backward direction,<br>
resulting in an image quality degradation such as<br>
nonuniformity (see FIG. 17C). Such a nonuniformity in the<br>
image may be reduced and a high-quality image may be obtained<br>
by recording only in the forward direction. Simultaneously,<br>
this may eliminate the color difference between a dot printed<br>
in the forward direction and a dot printed in the backward<br>
direction in the case of bidirectional printing. Further, the<br>
one-directional printing makes it easier to reduce beading<br>
because of the time required for the carriage to return to the<br>
print start position. The effect of a landing position error<br>
can also be made less visible by reducing the number of lines<br>
in halftones.<br>
FIG. 18B and FIG. 19B show actual printed images<br>
in the case of a high line number. While the original digital<br>
data should appear as a basic tone shown in FIG. 18A or FIG.<br>
19A, the basic tone appear weakened in FIG. 18B and FIG. 19B,<br><br>
due to the influence of a landing position error. By reducing<br>
the number of lines, the basic tone can be made to appear more<br>
clearly, as shown in FIG. 18D and FIG. 19D. In this way, the<br>
influence of a landing position error can be made less<br>
visible. When a borderless print is performed, discharge of<br>
ink onto areas outside the recording medium is undesirable.<br>
In this case, because it is difficult to support the sheet,<br>
image quality degradation is likely to occur. Thus, the<br>
landing position accuracy needs to be increased near the<br>
edges, and some measure needs to be taken to improve image<br>
quality. For this reason, a process is preferably carried out<br>
to achieve higher image quality when performing borderless<br>
print.<br>
Adjustment of attached ink amount<br>
When an ink or a sheet other than a specific<br>
product, such as a manufacturer's recommended product, is<br>
used, because the amount of ink that can be absorbed differs<br>
from one type of sheet to another, an excessive amount of ink<br>
may become attached, resulting in image quality degradation<br>
such as beading, cockeling, or transfer. Thus, the attached<br>
ink amount in this case needs to be limited. This can be<br>
realized by reducing the amount of ink that becomes attached<br>
per unit area below normal when recording.<br><br>
Improvement of hue error<br>
When an ink or a sheet other than a specific<br>
product is used, the probability is high that the ink has a<br>
hue that differs from the hue of the specific product. In<br>
this case, when the color of black or gray is produced by<br>
combining black ink and color ink, it may become impossible to<br>
maintain a specific gray balance. In order to maintain a<br>
specific gray balance, either black ink alone or composite<br>
black in which very small amounts of color ink are used may be<br>
used (i.e., the types of ink used are limited). Recently,<br>
image forming apparatuses are available in which light color<br>
inks, such as light magenta or light cyan, are adopted. In<br>
the case of these apparatuses, a recommended gray balance may<br>
be better maintained by using inks with smaller chroma values<br>
in combination while avoiding the use of inks with relatively<br>
large chroma values, such as cyan, magenta, or yellow,<br>
whenever possible.<br>
Ensuring ink drying time<br>
When an ink or a sheet other than a specific<br>
product is used, because the amount of ink absorbed differs<br>
from one type of sheet to another, an excess amount of ink may<br>
become attached, resulting in the ink requiring a long time to<br>
dry. In such a case, if high-speed printing is performed,<br>
large amounts of ink may remain undried on the sheet surface,<br><br>
possibly resulting in image quality degradation such as<br>
beading or cockeling. Such an image quality degradation can<br>
be reduced by making the period between the end of one scan in<br>
the horizontal scan direction and the start of the next scan<br>
longer than normal. For example, the standby time at the home<br>
position or the print start position before the next scan is<br>
initiated may be extended.<br>
The need for an extended period of time before<br>
the ink dries may also lead to the ink remaining undried even<br>
in the ejected paper tray after the sheet is ejected. In this<br>
case, if continuous printing is performed, there is the danger<br>
that, as a second printed sheet is laid over a first printed<br>
sheet in the ejected paper tray, the printed surface of the<br>
first sheet may be scratched, or the back surface of the<br>
second sheet may be soiled. Such an image quality degradation<br>
in the first and/or the second sheets can be prevented by<br>
making the time between the end of printing the recording<br>
medium and its ejection longer than normal.<br>
In the case of a both-side printing, typically<br>
the recording medium is printed on its first surface and then<br>
transferred back to have its second surface printed. In this<br>
case, if an ink or a sheet other than a recommended product<br>
is used, because the amount of ink absorbed differs from one<br>
type of sheet to another, an excessive amount of ink may<br>
become attached, possibly resulting in the ink on the first<br><br>
surface attaching to the sheet transfer mechanism. If that<br>
happens, image quality suffers not only on the first surface<br>
but also the second surface. Such an image quality<br>
degradation on the first surface and the second surface can be<br>
prevented by making the time between the end of printing of<br>
the first surface and the start of printing of the second<br>
surface longer than normal.<br>
The aforementioned processes for changing the<br>
image forming method may be performed using the aforementioned<br>
program executed by the image forming apparatus described with<br>
reference to FIGs. 1 through 10. The program is therefore an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The program, which may<br>
be stored as part of the printer driver in the ROM 202 shown<br>
in the block diagram of FIG. 5, may be started up by an<br>
operator operation and expanded on the RAM 203, followed by<br>
execution by the CPU 201. The printer driver including the<br>
program may be downloaded to the image forming apparatus from<br>
a storage unit on a network. Alternatively, the program may<br>
be installed on the image forming apparatus via a computer-<br>
readable recording medium such as a compact disc.<br>
Examples of the aforementioned computer-readable<br>
recording medium include semiconductor media (such as a ROM or<br>
a nonvolatile memory card); optical media (such as a digital<br>
versatile disc (DVD) , a rnagnetooptical disc (MO) , a MiniDisc<br>
(MD), and a Compact Disc Recordable (CD-R)); and magnetic<br><br>
media (such as magnetic tape or a flexible disc). Based on an<br>
instruction from the program that is loaded, part or all of<br>
the actual processes may be carried out by the operating<br>
system in order to realize the functions of the present<br>
embodiment. When the program is stored in a storage unit such<br>
as a hard disk drive in a server computer, and downloaded via<br>
a user's computer connected to a network for distribution, or<br>
when the program is distributed from a server computer, the<br>
storage unit of the server computer is included in the<br>
computer-readable recording medium according to the present<br>
embodiment of the invention. By thus writing the necessary<br>
functions in a program, recording it in a computer-readable<br>
recording medium, and then distributing it, improvements in<br>
terms of cost reduction, portability, and versatility can be<br>
achieved.<br>
Hereafter, an example of a specific recording<br>
medium used in the present embodiment of the invention is<br>
described.<br>
Media<br>
A recording medium according to the present<br>
embodiment comprises a support member and a coating layer on<br>
at least one side of the support. The recording medium may<br>
also include other layers as needed.<br><br>
Preferably, the recording medium has an ink<br>
transfer amount of 4 to 15 ml/m2 and more preferably 6 to 14<br>
ml/m2 as measured with a dynamic scanning absorptometer at the<br>
contact time of 100 ms. The transfer amount of pure water to<br>
the recording medium is preferably 4 to 26 ml/m and more<br>
preferably 8 to 25 ml/m2.<br>
If the transfer amount of ink or pure water at<br>
the contact time of 100 ms is too small, beading may become<br>
more likely to occur. If the transfer amount is too much, the<br>
recorded ink dot size may become smaller than desired.<br>
The transfer amount of ink to the recording<br>
medium of the present embodiment as measured with the dynamic<br>
scanning absorptometer at the contact time 400 ms is 7 to 20<br>
ml/m2 and preferably 8 to 19 ml/m2. Preferably, the transfer<br>
amount of pure water to the recording medium is 5 to 29 ml/m2<br>
and more preferably 10 to 28 ml/m2.<br>
If the transfer amount at the contact time 4 00 ms<br>
is too small, drying property is insufficient and a spur mark<br>
may become more likely to occur. If the transfer amount is<br>
too much, bleeding tends to occur, and the glossiness at an<br>
image portion after drying may become more likely to decrease.<br>
The dynamic scanning absorptometer (DSA) (as<br>
described by Shigenori Kuga in Japan TAPPI Journal, Vol. 48,<br>
pp. 88-92, May 1994) is an apparatus capable of accurately<br>
measuring the amount of liquid absorbed within an extremely<br><br>
short period of time. The dynamic scanning absorptometer is<br>
capable of performing automatic measurement using a method<br>
whereby the rate of liquid absorption is directly read from<br>
the movement of the meniscus in a capillary, a disc-shaped<br>
sample is scanned with a liquid absorption head in a helical<br>
manner, and the scan speed is automatically changed in<br>
accordance with a preset pattern to measure as many points as<br>
necessary on a single sample. A head for supplying liquid to<br>
a paper sample is connected to a capillary via a Teflon<br>
(registered trademark) tube, and the position of the meniscus<br>
in the capillary is automatically read by an optical sensor.<br>
Specifically, a dynamic scanning absorptometer (K350 Series,<br>
Type D, manufactured by Kyowa Co., Ltd.) was used to measure<br>
the transfer amount of pure water and ink. The transfer<br>
amount at contact times 100 ms and 400 ms can be determined by<br>
interpolation of measured values of transfer amounts at<br>
contact times around each of these contact times. The<br>
measurement was performed at 23 "C and 50% RH.<br>
Support member<br>
The support member is not particularly limited<br>
and may be appropriately selected depending on the purpose.<br>
Examples are a sheet of paper mainly made of wood fibers and a<br>
sheet of nonwoven fabric mainly made of wood and synthetic<br>
fibers.<br><br>
The aforementioned sheet of paper is not<br>
particularly limited and may be appropriately selected<br>
depending on the purpose. For example, it may be made of wood<br>
pulp or recycled pulp. Examples of wood pulp are leaf<br>
bleached kraft pulp (LBKP), needle bleached kraft pulp (NBKP),<br>
NBSP, LBSP, GP, and TMP.<br>
As materials of recycled pulp, recycled papers<br>
indicated in the list of standard qualities of recycled papers<br>
from the Paper Recycling Promotion Center may be used.<br>
Examples include high-quality white; white with lines; cream<br>
white; cards; special white; medium white; high-quality with<br>
ink; white with color ink; Kent; white art; medium-quality<br>
chip with color ink; low-quality chip with color ink;<br>
newspaper; and magazine. More specific examples are<br>
information-related paper such as non-coating computer paper,<br>
and printer paper such as thermal paper and impact paper; OA<br>
recycled paper such as PPC; coated paper such as art paper,<br>
ultra lightweight coated paper, and mat paper; and uncoated<br>
paper such as high-quality paper, high-quality paper with<br>
color ink, notebooks, letter paper, packaging paper, fancy<br>
paper, medium-quality paper, newspaper, coarse paper, high-<br>
quality with ink, pure-white roll paper, chemical pulp paper,<br>
and high-yield pulp containing paper. These types of paper may<br>
be used individually or in combination.<br><br>
Normally, recycled pulp is made by a combination<br>
of the following four steps:<br>
(1)	A defibrating step of breaking down used paper into fibers<br>
and separating ink from the fibers using mechanical force and<br>
chemicals in a pulper.<br>
(2)	A dust removing step of removing foreign matter (such as<br>
plastic) and dust in the used paper with a screen or a<br>
cleaner.<br>
(3)	A deinking step of expelling the ink separated by a<br>
surfactant from the fibers out of the system by a flotation<br>
method or a cleaning method.<br>
(4)	A bleaching step of increasing the whiteness of the fibers<br>
by oxidization or reduction.<br>
When mixing recycled pulp, the percentage of<br>
recycled pulp to the entire pulp is preferably 40% or lower so<br>
that produced paper does not curl after recording.<br>
As an internal filler for the support, a<br>
conventional white pigment may be used. Examples include<br>
inorganic pigments such as precipitated calcium carbonate,<br>
heavy calcium carbonate, kaolin, clay, talc, calcium sulfate,<br>
barium sulfate, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, zinc sulfide,<br>
zinc carbonate, satin white, aluminum silicate, diatomaceous<br>
earth, calcium silicate, magnesium silicate, synthetic silica,<br>
aluminum hydroxide, alumina, lithophone, zeolite, magnesium<br>
carbonate, and magnesium hydrate; and organic pigments such as<br><br>
styrene plastic pigment, acrylic plastic pigment,<br>
polyethylene, microcapsule, urea resin, and melamine resin.<br>
The above substances may be used individually or in<br>
combination.<br>
As an internal sizing agent used when producing<br>
the support, a neutral rosin size agent used for neutral<br>
papermaking, alkenyl succinic anhydride (ASA), alkyl ketene<br>
dimer (AKD), or a petroleum resin size agent may be used.<br>
Especially, a neutral rosin size agent and alkenyl succinic<br>
anhydride are preferable. Alkyl ketene dimer has a high<br>
sizing effect and therefore does not require a large added<br>
amount. However, because alkyl ketene dimer reduces the<br>
friction coefficient of the surface of recording paper<br>
(medium) and thus makes the paper made slippery, alkyl ketene<br>
dimer may not be suitable from the viewpoint of transport<br>
during inkjet recording.<br>
Coating layer<br>
The coating layer contains a pigment and a<br>
binder, and may also contain a surfactant and other components<br>
as needed.<br>
As the. pigment, an inorganic pigment or a mixture<br>
of an inorganic pigment and an organic pigment may be used.<br>
Examples of the inorganic pigment include kaolin,<br>
talc, heavy calcium carbonate, precipitated calcium carbonate,<br><br>
calcium sulfite, amorphous silica, alumina, titanium white,<br>
magnesium carbonate, titanium dioxide, aluminum hydroxide,<br>
calcium hydrate, magnesium hydrate, zinc hydroxide, and<br>
chlorite. Among those, kaolin is particularly preferable<br>
because it has superior glossiness exhibiting property and<br>
provides a texture similar to that of an offset paper.<br>
There are several types of kaolin, including<br>
delaminated kaolin, calcined kaolin, and engineered kaolin<br>
made by surface modification. In consideration of glossiness<br>
exhibiting property, 50% by mass or more of the entire kaolin<br>
has a particle size distribution such that 80% by mass or<br>
greater of the particles has a particle size of 2 urn or<br>
smaller.<br>
Preferably, the added amount of kaolin is 50<br>
parts by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of the entire<br>
pigment in the coating layer. If the added amount of kaolin<br>
is lower than 50 parts by mass, sufficient glossiness may not<br>
be obtained. While there is no specific upper limit to the<br>
amount of kaolin added, the added amount of kaolin is<br>
preferably 90 parts by mass or smaller from the viewpoint of<br>
surface-coating property and in consideration of fluidity of<br>
kaolin, particularly the thickening property of kaolin under a<br>
high shearing force.<br>
Examples of the organic pigment include a water-<br>
soluble dispersion of styrene-acrylic copolymer particles,<br><br>
styrene-butadiene copolymer particles, polystyrene particles,<br>
and polyethylene particles. Two or more of the above organic<br>
pigments may be used in combination.<br>
Preferably, the added amount of the organic<br>
pigment is 2 to 20 parts by mass with respect to 100 parts by<br>
mass of the entire pigment in the coating layer. Because the<br>
organic pigment has excellent glossiness exhibiting property<br>
and a specific gravity smaller than that of an inorganic<br>
pigment, it provides a thick, high-gloss coating layer having<br>
a good surface-coating property. If the added amount of the<br>
organic pigment is less than 2 parts by mass, the<br>
aforementioned effect may not be obtained. If it exceeds 20<br>
parts by mass, the fluidity of a coating liquid may worsen,<br>
resulting in a decrease in coating process efficiency and a<br>
cost disadvantage.<br>
The organic pigments may be classified by their<br>
particle shapes into the solid-type, the hollow-type, and the<br>
doughnut-shape type. To achieve a good balance among<br>
glossiness, surface-coating property, and fluidity of coating<br>
liquid, preferably the organic pigment has an average particle<br>
size of 0.2 to 3.0 μm. More preferably, the organic pigment<br>
is of the hollow-type with a void percentage of 4 0 percent or<br>
greater.<br>
As the binder, a water-based resin is preferably<br>
used.<br><br>
As the water-based resin, either a water-soluble<br>
resin or a water-dispersible resin may be suitably used. The<br>
water-soluble resin is not particularly limited and may be<br>
selected depending on the purpose. Examples are polyvinyl<br>
alcohol; a modified polyvinyl alcohol such as anion-modified<br>
polyvinyl alcohol, cation-modified polyvinyl alcohol, and<br>
acetal-modified polyvinyl alcohol; polyurethane; polyvinyl<br>
pyrrolidone; modified polyvinyl pyrrolidone such as polyvinyl<br>
pyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer, vinyl pyrrolidone-<br>
dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate copolymer, quaternized vinyl<br>
pyrrolidone-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate copolymer, and<br>
vinyl pyrrolidone-methacrylamide propyl trimethyl ammonium<br>
chloride copolymer; cellulose such as carboxymethyl cellulose,<br>
hydroxyethyl cellulose, and hydroxypropylcellulose; modified<br>
cellulose such as cationized hydroxyethyl cellulose;<br>
polyester, polyacrylic acid (ester), melamine resin, and their<br>
modified products; synthetic resin made of polyester-<br>
polyeurethane copolymer; and other substances such as<br>
poly(metha)acrylic acid, poly(metha)acrylamide, oxidized<br>
starch, phosphorylated starch, self-denatured starch,<br>
cationized starch, other modified starches, polyethylene<br>
oxide, polyacrylic acid soda, and alginic acid soda. The<br>
above substances may be used individually or in combination.<br>
Among the above substances, polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
cation-modified polyvinyl alcohol, acetal-modified polyvinyl<br><br>
alcohol, polyester, polyurethane, and polyester-polyeurethane<br>
copolymer are especially preferable in terms of ink absorbing<br>
property.<br>
The water-dispersible resin is not particularly<br>
limited and may be selected appropriately depending on the<br>
purpose. Examples are polyvinyl acetate, ethylene-polyvinyl<br>
acetate copolymer, polystyrene, styrene-(metha)acrylic ester<br>
copolymer, (metha)acrylic ester polymer, polyvinyl acetate-<br>
(metha)acrylic acid (ester) copolymer, styrene-butadiene<br>
copolymer, ethylene-propylene copolymer, polyvinyl ether, and<br>
silicone-acrylic copolymer. The water-dispersible resin may<br>
contain a cross-linking agent such as methylol melamine,<br>
methylol urea, methylol hydroxypropylene urea, or isocyanate.<br>
The water-dispersible resin may be a self-crosslinking<br>
copolymer containing a unit of N-methylol acrylamide. Two or<br>
more of such water-dispersible resins described above may be<br>
used at the same time.<br>
The added amount of the water-based resin is<br>
preferably 2 to 100 parts by mass and more preferably 3 to 50<br>
parts by mass to 100 parts by mass of the pigment. The added<br>
amount of the water-based resin is determined so that the<br>
liquid absorption property of a recording medium falls within<br>
a desired range.<br>
When a water-dispersible colorant is used as the<br>
coloring agent, the mixing of a cationic organic compound is<br><br>
optional, and an appropriate cationic organic compound may be<br>
selected and used depending on the purpose. Examples include<br>
primary to tertiary amines that react with sulfonic groups,<br>
carboxyl groups, or amino groups in a direct dye or an acid<br>
dye in a water-soluble ink to form insoluble salt; and a<br>
monomer, oligomer, or polymer of quarternary ammonium salt.<br>
Among these, an oligomer and a polymer are especially<br>
preferable.<br>
Examples of the cationic organic compound include<br>
dimethylamine-epichlorohydrin polycondensate, dimethylamine-<br>
ammonia-epichlorohydrin condensate, poly(trimethyl aminoethyl-<br>
methacrylate methylsulfate) , diallylamine hydrochloride-<br>
acrylamide copolymer, poly(diallylamine hydrochloride-sulfur<br>
dioxide), polyallylamine hydrochlorid, poly(allylamine<br>
hydrochlorid-diallylamine hydrochloride) , acrylarnide-<br>
diallylamine copolymer, polyvinylamine copolymer,<br>
dicyandiamide, dicyandiamide-ammonium chloride-urea-<br>
formaldehyde condensate, polyalkylene polyamine-dicyandiamide<br>
ammonium salt condensate, dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride,<br>
poly(diallylmethylamine) hydrochloride,<br>
poly(diallyldimethylammoniumchloride),<br>
poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride-sulfur dioxide),<br>
poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride-diallyl amine<br>
hydrochloride derivative), acrylamide-diallyldimethylammonium<br>
chloride copolymer, acrylate-acrylamide-diallyl amine<br><br>
hydrochloride copolymer, polyethylenimine, ethylenimine<br>
derivative such as acrylamine polymer, and modified<br>
polyethylenimine alkylene oxide. The above substances may be<br>
used individually or in combination.<br>
Among those mentioned above, it is preferable to<br>
use a cationic organic compound with a low-molecular weight,<br>
such as dimethylamine-epichlorohydrin polycondensate or<br>
polyallylamine hydrochlorid, in combination with a cationic<br>
organic compound with a relatively-high molecular weight, such<br>
as poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride). Such a combination<br>
improves image density and reduces feathering compared with a<br>
case where only one substance is used.<br>
The equivalent weight of cation in the cationic<br>
organic compound as measured by the colloid titration method<br>
(performed using polyvinyl potassium sulfate and toluidine<br>
blue) is preferably 3 to 8 meq/g. With the equivalent weight<br>
of cation in this range, good results can be obtained within<br>
the aforementioned range of dry deposit amount.<br>
In the measurement of the equivalent weight of<br>
cation with the aforementioned colloid titration method, the<br>
cationic organic compound is diluted with distillated water so<br>
that the solid content in the solution becomes 0.1% by mass.<br>
No pH control is performed.<br>
The dry deposit amount of the cationic organic<br>
compound is preferably between 0.3 and 2.0 g/m2. If the dry<br><br>
deposit amount of the cationic organic compound is smaller<br>
than 0.3 g/m2, sufficient improvement in image density may not<br>
be obtained or reduction in feathering may not be achieved.<br>
The surfactant is not particularly limited and<br>
may be appropriately selected depending on the purpose.<br>
Either an anion surfactant, a cation surfactant, an amphoteric<br>
surfactant, or a nonionic surfactant may be used. Among the<br>
above surfactants, a nonionic surfactant is particularly<br>
preferable. Adding a surfactant improves water resistance of<br>
an image and increases image density, and also reduces<br>
bleeding.<br>
Examples of the nonionic surfactants include<br>
higher alcohol ethylene oxide adduct, alkylphenol ethylene<br>
oxide adduct, fatty acid ethylene oxide adduct, polyhydric<br>
alcohol fatty acid ester ethylene oxide adduct, higher<br>
aliphatic amine ethylene oxide adduct, fatty acid amide<br>
ethylene oxide adduct, fatty oil ethylene oxide adduct,<br>
polypropylene glycol ethylene oxide adduct, glycerol fatty<br>
acid ester, pentaerythritol fatty acid ester, sorbitol-<br>
sorbitan fatty acid ester, sucrose fatty acid ester,<br>
polyhydric alcohol alkyl ether, and alkanolamine fatty acid<br>
amide. The above substances may be used individually or in<br>
combination.<br>
The polyhydric alcohol is not particularly<br>
limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the<br><br>
purpose. Examples are glycerol, trimethylolpropane,<br>
pentaerythrite, sorbitol, and sucrose. With reference to an<br>
ethylene oxide adduct, part of the ethylene oxide may be<br>
substituted with an alkylene oxide such as propylene oxide or<br>
butylene oxide to the extent that water solubility is not<br>
affected. The substitution ratio is preferably 50 percent or<br>
lower. The hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) of the nonionic<br>
surfactant is preferably between 4 and 15 and more preferably<br>
between 7 and 13.<br>
The added amount of the surfactant is preferably<br>
0 to 10 parts by mass and more preferably 0.1 to 1.0 part by<br>
mass to 100 parts by mass of the cationic organic compound.<br>
Other components may also be added to the coating<br>
layer to the extent that its advantageous effects are not<br>
undermined. Examples of such other components include<br>
additives such as an alumina powder, a pH adjuster, an<br>
antiseptic agent, and an antioxidant.<br>
The method of forming the coating layer is not<br>
particularly limited and may be appropriately selected<br>
depending on the purpose. One example is a method whereby the<br>
support is impregnated or applied with a coating liquid. The<br>
method of impregnation or application of the coating layer is<br>
not particularly limited and may be selected appropriately<br>
depending on the purpose. For example, a coating machine may<br>
be used. Examples of the coating machine include a<br><br>
conventional size press, a gate roll size press, a film<br>
transfer size press, a blade coater, a rod coater, an air<br>
knife coater, and a curtain coater. A preferable example from<br>
the viewpoint of cost is a method whereby the support is<br>
impregnated or applied with a coating liquid using a<br>
conventional size press, a gate roll size press, or a film<br>
transfer size press attached to a paper machine so that the<br>
process can be finished on-machine.<br>
The amount of the coating liquid on the support<br>
is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected<br>
depending on the purpose. Preferably, the solid content of<br>
the coating liquid is 0.5 to 20 g/m2 and more preferably 1 to<br>
15 g/m2. If the solid content is less than 0.5 g/m2, the ink<br>
cannot be sufficiently absorbed, resulting in an overflow of<br>
ink and character bleeding. Conversely, if the solid content<br>
exceeds 20 g/m2, the texture of the paper is adversely<br>
affected, resulting in problems such as the difficulty in<br>
bending of the sheet or writing on it with a writing<br>
instrument.<br>
After the impregnation or application of a<br>
coating liquid, the coating liquid may be dried as needed.<br>
The temperature for this drying process is not particularly<br>
limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the<br>
purpose. Preferably, the temperature is in the range of from<br>
100 to 250 °C.<br><br>
The recording medium may also have a back layer<br>
formed on the back of the support, and other layers between<br>
the support and the coating layer or between the support and<br>
the back layer. A protective layer may also be provided on<br>
the coating layer. Each of these layers may be composed of<br>
one or more layers.<br>
The recording medium in accordance with the<br>
present embodiment may be commercially available coated paper<br>
for offset printing or coated paper for gravure printing, as<br>
well as a medium used for ink jet recording, as long as their<br>
liquid absorbing property is within the aforementioned range.<br>
Preferably, the basis weight of the recording<br>
medium in accordance with the present embodiment is in the<br>
range of from 50 to 250 g/m2. If the basis weight is less<br>
than 50 g/m2, a transportation defect such as the jamming of<br>
the recording medium in the transportation path becomes more<br>
likely to occur due to lack of strength. If the basis weight<br>
exceeds 250 g/m2, the strength may be too high for the<br>
recording medium to turn a curved part of the transportation<br>
path, also resulting in a transport defect such as the jamming<br>
of the recording medium.<br>
Recording head<br>
Hereafter, an example of a specific recording<br>
head in accordance with the present embodiment is described.<br><br>
A nozzle plate of the specific recording head is<br>
superior in water or ink repellency, so that, even when ink<br>
with low surface tension is used, ink droplets (i.e., ink<br>
particles) can be formed in a satisfactory manner. This is<br>
due to the fact that the nozzle plate is not wetted too much,<br>
enabling the normal formation of an ink meniscus. When the<br>
meniscus is normally formed, ink does not get pulled in one<br>
direction when ejected. As a result, there is less skewing in<br>
ink ejection, and an image with high dot-position accuracy can<br>
be obtained.<br>
When printing a sheet with low absorbance, the<br>
image quality is gteatly affected by the dot position<br>
accuracy. Namely, because ink does not spread easily on a<br>
sheet with low absorbance, even a small amount of decrease in<br>
dot position accuracy leads to a portion on the sheet that is<br>
not completely filled with ink, i.e., a void. Such an<br>
unfilled portion results in image density nonuniformity or<br>
image density decrease, thus adversely affecting image<br>
quality.<br>
However, because the nozzle plate of the<br>
recording head in accordance with the present embodiment can<br>
provide high dot position accuracy even when the ink has low<br>
surface tension, even a sheet having low absorbance can be<br>
filled with ink. As a result, there is no image density<br>
nonuniformity or image density decrease, so that printed<br><br>
matter having high image quality can be obtained. Thus, an<br>
image forming method according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention needs to be used in the absence of the recording<br>
head of the present embodiment.<br>
When ink with a relatively low surface tension is<br>
used, the nozzle plate desirably has excellent water<br>
repellency and ink repellency. This is due to the fact that<br>
by using a nozzle plate having excellent water repellency and<br>
ink repellency, it becomes possible to form an ink meniscus<br>
normally even when the ink has low surface tension, and, as a<br>
result, ink droplets (i.e., ink particles) can be formed in a<br>
satisfactory manner. When the meniscus is normally formed,<br>
the problem of the ink being pulled in one direction upon<br>
ejection can be avoided. As a result, the ink ejection skew<br>
can be reduced and an image with high dot position accuracy<br>
can be obtained.<br>
When printing a medium (sheet) having low<br>
absorbance, the dot position accuracy notably affects image<br>
quality. Specifically, because ink does not easily spread<br>
over a medium with low absorbance, a portion appears on the<br>
medium that is not completely filled with ink, i.e., a void,<br>
if dot position accuracy drops even a little. Such an<br>
unfilled portion leads to image density nonuniformity and a<br>
decrease in image density, thus adversely affecting image<br>
quality.<br><br>
In accordance with the present embodiment,<br>
because the inkjet head provides high dot position accuracy-<br>
even when ink with low surface tension is used, even a medium<br>
having low absorbance can be fully filled with ink. Thus,<br>
printed matter with high image quality can be obtained having<br>
no image density nonuniformity or image density decrease.<br>
Ink-repellent layer material<br>
The material of the ink-repellent layer may<br>
comprise any material as long as it repels ink. Examples are<br>
fluorine water-repellent material and silicone-based water-<br>
repellent material.<br>
There are many types of fluorine water-repellent<br>
materials. An example is a mixture of perfluoropolyoxetane<br>
and modified perfluoropolyoxetane ("OPTOOL DSX" from Daikin<br>
Industries, Ltd.). Necessary water repellency can be obtained<br>
by depositing it to a thickness of 1-30 A. In an experiment,<br>
no difference was seen in water repellency and wiping<br>
durability when the thickness of OPTOOL DSX was 10, 20, or 30<br>
A. When factors including cost are taken into account, the<br>
thickness is preferably 1 to 20 A. An adhesive tape made of<br>
resin film and applied with adhesive material may be affixed<br>
to the surface of a fluorine water-repellent layer to provide<br>
an auxiliary function during excimer laser processing.<br><br>
Alternatively, a silicone water-repellent material may be<br>
used.<br>
Examples of silicone water-repellent material<br>
include room-temperature curing liquid silicone resin and<br>
elastomer. Preferably, such a silicone water-repellent<br>
material is applied to a base material surface and left to<br>
stand in the atmosphere at room temperature in order to allow<br>
it to polymerize and cure to form an ink-repellent coating.<br>
The silicone water-repellent material may be thermally cured<br>
liquid silicone resin or elastomer, which may be applied to a<br>
base material surface and heated to cure and form an ink-<br>
repellent coating. Further, the silicone water-repellent<br>
material may be UV curing liquid silicone resin or elastomer,<br>
which may be applied to a base material surface and irradiated<br>
with UV ray to cure and form an ink-repellent coating. The<br>
viscosity of the silicone water-repellent material is<br>
preferably 1,000 cP or lower.<br>
Ink-repellent layer<br>
Surface roughness of the ink-repellent layer is<br>
described. Preferably, the surface roughness Ra of the ink-<br>
repellent layer is 0.2 μm or smaller. By keeping the surface<br>
roughness Ra 0.2 μm or smaller, the amount of ink that remains<br>
after wiping can be reduced.<br><br>
FIGs. 20 and 21 show cross sections of inkjet<br>
head nozzle plates fabricated in accordance with an<br>
embodiment. In this embodiment, a nozzle plate 2, which is a<br>
base material for an inkjet head, is fabricated by<br>
electroforming of Ni. On the surface of the nozzle plate 2,<br>
there is formed an ink-repellent film 1, which is a silicone<br>
resin coating, having a film thickness of 0.1 μm or greater.<br>
The surface roughness Ra of the ink-repellent film 1 is<br>
preferably 0.2 or smaller. Preferably, the film thickness of<br>
the ink-repellent film 1 is 0.5 μm or greater.<br>
Upon filling with ink 3, a meniscus (liquid<br>
level) P is formed at the boundary between the ink-repellent<br>
film 1, i.e., the silicone resin coating, and the nozzle plate<br>
2, as shown in FIG. 22C.<br>
The ink-repellent film 1 is formed such that the<br>
cross-sectional area of a plane perpendicular to a center line<br>
of the ink discharge opening formed in the inkjet head<br>
gradually increases with increasing distance between the plane<br>
and the base material surface.<br>
Preferably, the profile of the ink-repellent film<br>
1 near the opening is curved.<br>
Preferably, the radius of curvature of the ink-<br>
repellent film near the opening in a cross section taken along<br>
a plane including the center line of the opening is greater<br>
than the thickness of the ink-repellent film.<br><br>
Preferably, the curve that extends from the edge<br>
of the opening in the ink-repellent film to a region near the<br>
opening in the cross section taken along a plane including the<br>
center line of the opening is substantially circular-arch<br>
shaped. Preferably, the radius of curvature of the arch is<br>
greater than the thickness of the ink-repellent film.<br>
Preferably, in the cross section taken along a<br>
plane including the center line of the opening, a tangent to<br>
the edge of the opening in the ink-repellent film forms an<br>
angle of less than 90° with the surface of the nozzle member<br>
including the edge.<br>
The opening of the nozzle plate 2 is formed in a<br>
substantially circular shape about the center line indicated<br>
by the dotted line in FIGs. 21A through 21C, in a cross<br>
section taken along a plane perpendicular to the center line.<br>
The ink-repellent film 1 is formed on the ink discharge<br>
surface of the nozzle plate 2 such that the cross-sectional<br>
area of the opening in a plane perpendicular to the center<br>
line increases with increasing distance from the nozzle plate<br>
2.<br>
More specifically, the opening of the ink-<br>
repellent film 1 is, as shown in FIG. 21A, the curve at the<br>
opening that extends from the opening edge of the nozzle plate<br>
2 to a portion near the opening has a radius of curvature r.<br>
Preferably, the radius of curvature r is greater than the<br><br>
thickness d of the ink-repellent film 1 at a portion other<br>
than the opening portion.<br>
The thickness d is a thickness of the ink-<br>
repellent film 1 at a portion other than its rounded portion<br>
at the opening. Preferably, the thickness d may be the<br>
maximum thickness of the ink-repellent film.<br>
Thus, the opening portion of the ink-repellent<br>
film 1 adjacent to the opening of the nozzle plate 2 is<br>
smoothly curved and has substantially no peaks or pointed<br>
portions. In this way, when the nozzle is wiped with a wiper<br>
made of material such as rubber, because there is no pointed<br>
portions that could catch the wiper, the ink-repellent film 1<br>
is prevented from being peeled from the nozzle plate 2.<br>
Preferably, as shown in FIG. 21B, the tangent to<br>
the edge of the opening of the ink-repellent film 1 in the<br>
cross section taken along a plane including the center line of<br>
the opening of the nozzle plate 2 forms an angle 9 of less<br>
than 90° with the surface of the nozzle plate 2 including its<br>
edge adjacent to the opening of the ink-repellent film 1.<br>
Thus, because the angle 9 between the tangent to<br>
the opening edge of the ink-repellent film 1 and the surface<br>
of the nozzle plate 2 is less than 90°, the meniscus (liquid<br>
level) P is stably formed at the boundary between the ink-<br>
repellent film 1 and the nozzle plate 2, as shown in FIG. 21C.<br><br>
In this way, the probability of the meniscus P being formed at<br>
a different portion can be greatly reduced.<br>
The stable formation of the meniscus enables the<br>
ink to be ejected stably when forming an image with an image<br>
forming apparatus in which an inkjet head including the nozzle<br>
plate 2 is used.<br>
Preferably, a silicone resin that cures at room<br>
temperature, particularly one involving hydrolysis reaction,<br>
is used.<br>
In the following example, SR2411 manufactured by<br>
Dow Corning Toray Co. Ltd. was used.<br>
Table 1 shows the result of evaluation of various<br>
properties of the ink-repellent film 1 in the inkjet head,<br>
including the profile at the edge of the opening of the nozzle<br>
plate 2, the build-up of ink around the nozzle, edge peeling,<br>
and ejection stability.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
When the edge of the ink-repellent film 1 (at or<br>
near the opening edge) had a substantially pointed portion, a<br><br>
buildup of ink was observed around the nozzle, and edge<br>
peeling due to wiping occurred.<br>
When the edge was rounded, no buildup of ink was<br>
observed in any of the examples. However, partial peeling of<br>
the edge occurred in a comparative example shown in FIG. 22A<br>
where r  90° as shown in FIG. 22B, the ejection<br>
of droplet was unstable.<br>
An analysis indicates that, as shown in FIG. 22C,<br>
when r  90°, a meniscus (liquid level) P may be<br>
formed at the boundary between the ink-repellent film 1 and<br>
the nozzle plate 2 when filled with ink 3, or a meniscus Q may<br>
be formed at the bulging portion of the ink-repellent film 1'<br>
that extends toward the center of the opening (where the<br>
cross-sectional area perpendicular to the center line of the<br>
opening is minimum). As a result, fluctuations are caused in<br>
ink ejection stability when forming an image in an image<br>
forming apparatus using an inkjet head having such a nozzle<br>
plate 2.<br>
Hereafter, a process of manufacturing the inkjet<br>
head nozzle member according to an embodiment is described.<br>
FIG. 23 shows the ink-repellent film 1 being<br>
formed by applying silicone resin with a dispenser 4 according<br>
to the present embodiment.<br>
The dispenser 4 for applying silicone solution is<br>
disposed on the ink-discharge side of a nozzle 2, which is<br><br>
made by Ni electroforming. With a predetermined distance<br>
maintained between the nozzle plate 2 and the tip of a needle<br>
5, the dispenser 4 is moved while the silicone is discharged<br>
from the tip of the needle 5. In this way, a silicone resin<br>
coating was selectively formed on the ink discharge surface of<br>
the nozzle plate 2, as shown in FIG. 20 and FIGs. 21A through<br>
21C. The silicone resin used in the present example was the<br>
room-temperature-curing silicone resin SR2411 (by Dow Corning<br>
Toray Co. Ltd.), with the viscosity of 10 mPa.s. It is noted,<br>
however, that some deposition of silicone was observed on the<br>
nozzle openings and the back side of the nozzle plate. The<br>
thickness of the thus selectively formed silicone resin<br>
coating was 1.2 um, and its surface roughness (Ra) was 0.18<br>
urn.<br>
The needle 5 has a coater opening at the tip<br>
which has a width corresponding to the width with which the<br>
nozzle plate 2 is to be coated, as shown in FIG. 24A. Thus,<br>
coating of the necessary portion of the nozzle plate 2 can be<br>
completed in a single scan by the dispenser 4 in a coating<br>
direction.<br>
In other words, the scan for the coating<br>
operation needs to be performed in just one direction, and the<br>
need for changing the scan direction or scanning in the<br>
opposite direction, as shown in FIG. 24B, can be eliminated.<br><br>
FIG. 24B shows how the nozzle plate 2 is coated<br>
using a conventional needle 5'. Because the tip of the needle<br>
5' in this case is much narrower than the width of the nozzle<br>
plate 2 to be coated, the scan direction needs to be changed<br>
by 90° or reversed in multiple times in order to complete the<br>
coating of the entire area, making it difficult to provide a<br>
coating with a uniform thickness.<br>
In accordance with the present embodiment,<br>
because the coater opening at the tip of the needle 5 has a<br>
width corresponding to the width with which the nozzle plate 2<br>
needs to be coated, it becomes possible to provide a uniform<br>
thickness over the entire surface that needs to be coated,<br>
whereby an accurate surface finish can be achieved.<br>
FIG. 25 illustrates a coating operation performed<br>
by using the dispenser 4 in another embodiment. The present<br>
embodiment differs from the foregoing embodiment illustrated<br>
in FIG. 23 in that silicone is applied while gas 6 is ejected<br>
out of a nozzle opening in the nozzle plate 2. The gas 6 may<br>
be any gas as long as it does not easily chemically react with<br>
the applied silicone. For example, the gas 6 may be air.<br>
By thus performing a coating operation while the<br>
gas 6 is ejected via the nozzle opening, a silicone resin<br>
coating can be formed on the upper surface of the nozzle plate<br>
2 alone excluding the other nozzle opening surfaces.<br><br>
In another embodiment, similar silicone resin may<br>
be applied without the ejection of the gas 6. In this<br>
embodiment, as shown in FIG. 26, the gas 6 may be ejected via<br>
the nozzle 2 after the silicone resin reached down to a<br>
predetermined depth. In this way, it becomes possible to form<br>
an ink-repellent layer of silicone resin to a desired depth on<br>
the internal surface of the nozzle (such as on the order of<br>
several μm).<br>
Thus, in addition to the above-described ink-<br>
repellent film 1 on the ink discharge surface, a very thin<br>
ink-repellent film la can be formed on the internal surface of<br>
the opening from the opening edge of the nozzle plate 2 down<br>
to a predetermined depth.<br>
The thus fabricated ink-repellent film 1 formed<br>
on the nozzle plate was subjected to wiping with EPDM rubber<br>
(rubber hardness: 50). As a result, the ink-repellent film 1<br>
on the nozzle plate retained good ink repellency after 1000<br>
times of wiping. In another test, a nozzle member formed with<br>
the ink-repellent film was immersed in ink at temperature of<br>
70 'C for 14 days. As a result, the ink-repellent film<br>
retained the same ink repellency as that before the test.<br>
Hereafter, the thickness of the water-repellent<br>
layer film is discussed. FIG. 27 shows an inkjet head<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention, where a<br>
nozzle opening 44 is formed by excimer laser processing. A<br><br>
nozzle plate 43 includes a resin member 121 and a high-<br>
stiffness member 125 joined together with thermoplastic cement<br>
126. On the surface of the resin member 121, a SiO2 thin-film<br>
layer 122 and a fluorine water-repellent layer 123 are<br>
successively laminated. A nozzle opening 44 having a required<br>
diameter is formed in the resin member 121. In the high-<br>
stiffness member 125, there is formed a nozzle-communicating<br>
opening 127 that is in communication with the nozzle opening<br>
44. The SiO2 thin-film layer 122 is formed by a relatively<br>
heat-free process, i.e., a process capable of film formation<br>
within a temperature range such that the resin member is not<br>
thermally affected. Suitable examples are sputtering, ion<br>
beam deposition, ion plating, chemical vapor deposition (CVD),<br>
and plasma chemical vapor deposition (P-CVD).<br>
It is advantageous to minimize the film thickness<br>
of the SiO2 thin-film layer 122 to the extent that its<br>
adhesive power can be ensured, from the viewpoint of process<br>
time and material cost. If the film thickness is too much,<br>
problems may develop during the nozzle opening process by an<br>
excimer laser. Specifically, even when the resin member 121<br>
is cleanly processed in the shape of a nozzle opening, part of<br>
the SiO2 thin-film layer 122 may not be sufficiently processed<br>
and remain unprocessed. More specifically, the film thickness<br>
is preferably in the range of from 1 A to 300 A and more<br>
preferably from 10 A to 100 A. In an experiment, sufficient<br><br>
adhesion was obtained even when the SiO2 film thickness was 30<br>
A and there was no problem in excimer laser processability.<br>
When the film thickness was 300 A, although a small<br>
unprocessed portion remained, there was no practical problems.<br>
When the thickness was beyond 300 A, a rather large<br>
unprocessed portion remained, resulting in such a nozzle<br>
deformity as to render the nozzle unusable.<br>
FIG. 28 shows a configuration of an excimer laser<br>
processing apparatus used for forming a nozzle opening. A<br>
laser oscillator 81 emits an excimer laser beam 82 which is<br>
reflected by mirrors 83, 85, and 88 as it is guided to a<br>
processing table 90. Along the optical path of the laser beam<br>
82 before it reaches the processing table 90, there are<br>
disposed a beam expander 84, a mask 86, a field lens 87, and<br>
imaging optics 8 9 at respectively predetermined positions so<br>
that an optimum beam can reach a processed item 91. The<br>
processed item (nozzle plate) 91, which is disposed on the<br>
processing table 90, receives the laser beam. The processing<br>
table 90, which may consist of a known XYZ table, is<br>
configured such tha.t the processed item 91 can be moved as<br>
required and irradiated at a desired position with the laser<br>
beam. While the laser has been described as being excimer<br>
laser, any type of laser may be used as long as it is a short-<br>
wavelength UV laser capable of abrasion processing.<br><br>
FIG. 29A through 29F schematically show the steps<br>
of manufacturing a nozzle plate in a process of manufacturing<br>
an inkjet head according to an embodiment of the invention.<br>
FIG. 29A shows a resin film 121 as a base material of a nozzle<br>
forming member. The resin film 121 may comprise a polyimide<br>
film such as Kapton (brand name) by DuPont that contains no<br>
particles. A conventional polyimide film contains particles<br>
of SiO2 (silica), for example, for the sake of ease of<br>
handling (slipperiness) on a roll film handling device.<br>
However, the SiO2 (silica) particles obstruct the process of<br>
nozzle opening formation by an excimer laser and may lead to a<br>
deformation of the nozzle. For this reason, a polyimide film<br>
that does not contain SiO2 (silica) particles is preferable.<br>
FIG. 29B shows the step of forming the SiO2 thin-<br>
film layer on the Surface of the resin film 121. The SiO2<br>
thin-film layer 122 is formed preferably by sputtering in a<br>
vacuum chamber. The thickness of the SiO2 thin-film layer 122<br>
is preferably in the range of from several A to 200 A. In<br>
this example, the thickness of the SiO2 thin-film layer 122 is<br>
between 10 and 50 A. As regards the sputtering method, it has<br>
been learned that by performing Si sputtering and then<br>
bombarding the Si Surface with 02 ions, the adhesion of the<br>
SiO2 thin-film layer 122 to the resin film 121 can be improved<br>
and a uniform and dense film can be obtained. In this way,<br><br>
the wiping durability of a water-repellent layer can be<br>
improved.<br>
FIG. 29C shows the step of applying a fluorine<br>
water-repellent 123a. Although application methods such as<br>
spin coating, roll coating, screen printing, and spray coating<br>
may be used, vacuum deposition is preferable to improve the<br>
adhesion of the water-repellent layer. Vacuum deposition is<br>
preferably performed in the same vacuum chamber after the<br>
formation of the SiO2 thin-film layer 122, as shown in FIG.<br>
30B. This is believed due to the fact that if the work is<br>
taken out of the vacuum chamber after the formation of the<br>
SiO2 thin-film layer 122, impurities may adhere to the surface<br>
of the SiC&gt;2 thin-film layer 122 to reduce adhesion. While<br>
various fluorine water-repellent materials are known, a<br>
fluorine amorphous compound such as perfluoropolyoxetane,<br>
modified perfluoropolyoxetane, or a mixture thereof may be<br>
preferably used to obtain sufficient water repellency. The<br>
aforementioned "OPTOOL DSX" by Daikin Industries, Ltd. may<br>
also be referred to as alkoxysilane terminus modified<br>
perfluoropolyether.<br>
FIG. 29D shows the step in which the plate is<br>
left to stand in the atmosphere, whereby the fluorine water-<br>
repellent 123a chemically binds to the SiO2 thin-film layer<br>
122 via the moisture in the atmosphere, thereby forming the<br>
fluorine water-repellent layer 123.<br><br>
FIG. 29E shows the step of affixing an adhesive<br>
tape 124 to the coated surface of the fluorine water-repellent<br>
layer 123. The adhesive tape 124 needs to be affixed such<br>
that no air bubbles are present between the adhesive tape 124<br>
and the fluorine water-repellent layer 123. If bubbles are<br>
present, the quality of a nozzle opening formed in a position<br>
where bubbles are present may be degraded by undesired matter<br>
during processing.<br>
FIG. 29F shows the step of processing the nozzle<br>
opening 44 by excimer laser irradiation from the polyimide<br>
film side. After the nozzle opening 44 is formed, the<br>
adhesive tape 124 is removed. In the foregoing, description<br>
of the high-stiffness member 125, which is used to increase<br>
the rigidity of the nozzle plate 43 as described with<br>
reference to FIG. 27, has been omitted. In another<br>
embodiment, the high-stiffness member 125 may be appropriately<br>
provided between the steps of FIGs. 29D and 29E.<br>
FIG. 30 schematically shows an apparatus 200 that<br>
may be used to manufacture an inkjet head according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The apparatus 200 is<br>
designed to implement a technique called "MetaMode®" developed<br>
by Optical Coating Laboratory, Inc. (OCLI) of the U.S.A. The<br>
MetaMode® process may be used to make<br>
antireflection/antifouling films on displays. As shown, a<br>
drum 201 is surrounded at four locations by an Si sputter<br><br>
station 202, an 02 ion gun station 203, an Nb sputtering<br>
station 204, and an OPTOOL vapor deposition station 205, which<br>
are all disposed in a chamber that can be vacuumized. First,<br>
the Si sputtering station 202 performs Si sputtering. The O2<br>
ion gun station 203 then bombards the Si with 02 ions to form<br>
SiO2. Then, Nb is provided by the Nb sputter station 204 and<br>
OPTOOL DSX is deposited by the OPTOOL vapor deposition station<br>
205 as needed. In the case of an antireflection film,<br>
deposition takes place after a necessary number of layers of<br>
Nb and SiO2 with predetermined thicknesses are laminated.<br>
Because the function of an antireflection film is not<br>
necessary in the case of various embodiments of the present<br>
invention, Nb is not required and only one layer each of SiO2<br>
and OPTOOL DSX needs to be formed. By using this apparatus,<br>
it becomes possible to deposit OPTOOL DSX in the same vacuum<br>
chamber after the formation of the SiO2 thin-film layer 122,<br>
as mentioned above.<br>
In the following, the critical surface tension of<br>
the ink-repellent layer is described. The critical surface<br>
tension of the ink-repellent layer is preferably 5 to 40 mN/m<br>
and more preferably 5 to 30 mN/m. When the critical surface<br>
tension is greater than 30 mN/m, ink wets the nozzle plate too<br>
much over a long period of use, whereby problems such as ink<br>
discharge skew and abnormal ink drop formation may occur after<br>
repeated printing. When the critical surface tension exceeds<br><br>
40 mN/m, ink wets the nozzle plate too much from an initial<br>
period, and problems such as ink discharge skew and abnormal<br>
ink drop formation may occur. In an experiment, ink-repellent<br>
materials shown in Table 2 below were applied to an aluminum<br>
substrate, which was then heated to prepare nozzle plates<br>
having ink-repellent layers. Table 2 shows the result of<br>
measuring the critical surface tension of those water-<br>
repellent layers.<br>
Table 2<br><br>
The critical surface tension can be determined by<br>
the Zisman method. Specifically, droplets of liquids with<br>
known surface tensions are placed onto the ink-repellent<br>
layer, and their contact angles 9 are measured. By plotting<br>
the surface tension of each liquid on the x axis and cosØ on<br>
the y axis, a line sloping to the right (Zisman Plot) is<br>
obtained.<br>
The critical surface tension YC is the surface<br>
tension at which Y = 1 (9=0). The critical surface tension<br>
can be also obtained by other methods, such as the Fowkes<br><br>
method, the Owens and Wendt method, and the Van Oss method.<br>
In an experiment, inkjet heads were fabricated using nozzle<br>
plates having an ink-repellent layer by the same method as<br>
described above. The cyan ink according to Manufactured<br>
Example 1 (which is described later) was ejected from the<br>
inkjet head. When the trajectory of the ink was recorded in<br>
video and observed, normal particles of the ink were formed in<br>
all of the cases of the nozzle plates, indicating the good<br>
discharge stability of the inkjet heads.<br>
Hereafter, an example of a specific ink according<br>
to an embodiment is described.<br>
Ink<br>
The ink according to the present embodiment<br>
contains at least water, a colorant, and a humectant. It may<br>
also contain a penetrant, a surfactant, and other components<br>
as needed.<br>
The surface tension of the ink is preferably 15<br>
to 40 mN/m and more preferably 20 to 35 mN/m. When the<br>
surface tension is less than 15 mN/m, the ink may wet the<br>
nozzle plate so much that ink droplets are not properly<br>
formed, or significant bleeding may occur on the recording<br>
medium, thus preventing the stable discharge of the ink. When<br>
the surface tension is greater than 40 mN/m, the ink may fail<br><br>
to penetrate the recording medium sufficiently, resulting in<br>
beading or an extended drying time.<br>
The surface tension of the ink may be measured<br>
with the CBVP-Z surface tensiometer from Kyowa Interface<br>
Science Co., Ltd., using a platinum plate at temperature of<br>
25 °C.<br>
Colorant<br>
Preferably, at least one of a pigment, a dye, and<br>
a colored particle is used as the aforementioned colorant.<br>
Preferably, the aforementioned colored particle<br>
comprises an aqueous dispersion of polymer particles<br>
containing at least a pigment or a dye as a colorant.<br>
That the polymer particles "contain" a colorant<br>
means that the colorant is either encapsulated in the polymer<br>
particles, the colorant is adsorbed on the surface of the<br>
polymer particles, or both. Not all of the colorant needs to<br>
be encapsulated in or adsorbed on the polymer particles; the<br>
colorant may be dispersed in an emulsion as long as the<br>
advantageous effects of various embodiments of the present<br>
invention are not adversely affected. The colorant is not<br>
particularly limited and may be suitably selected depending on<br>
the purpose, as long as it is water-insoluble or poorly water-<br>
soluble and can be adsorbed on the polymer particles.<br><br>
"Water-insoluble" or "poorly water-soluble"<br>
indicates that no more than 10 parts by mass of the colorant<br>
can be dissolved in 100 parts by mass of water at a<br>
temperature of 20 °C. "Dissolved" means that no separation or<br>
sediment of the colorant is identified in the upper or the<br>
lower layer of the aqueous solution by visual inspection.<br>
Preferably, the volume average particle size of a<br>
polymer particle (colored particle) containing the colorant is<br>
0.01 to 0.16 μm in the ink. When the volume average particle<br>
size is less than 0.01 μm, the polymer particles tend to flow,<br>
resulting in increased bleeding or decrease in light<br>
resistance. When the volume average particle size is more<br>
than 0.16 μm, the nozzle may be clogged or color development<br>
of the ink may be inhibited.<br>
Examples of the colorant include a water-soluble<br>
dye, an oil-soluble dye, a disperse dye, and a pigment. From<br>
the viewpoint of absorbability and encapsulation, an oil-<br>
soluble dye or a disperse dye is preferable. From the<br>
viewpoint of light resistance of an image formed, a pigment is<br>
preferable.<br>
Preferably, the amount of the dye that is<br>
dissolved in an organic solvent, such as a ketone solvent, is<br>
2 g/1 or more and more preferably 20 to 600 g/1 from the<br>
viewpoint of efficient impregnation in the polymer particles.<br><br>
The aforementioned water-soluble dye may comprise<br>
a dye classified as being an acid dye, a direct dye, a basic<br>
dye, a reactive dye, or a food dye in the Color Index.<br>
Preferably, a dye with high water-resistance and high light<br>
resistance is used.<br>
Humectant<br>
The humectant is not particularly limited and may<br>
be appropriately selected depending on the purpose. A<br>
suitable example is at least one selected from a polyol<br>
compound, a lactam compound, a urea compound, and a<br>
saccharide.<br>
Penetrant<br>
The aforementioned penetrant may comprise a<br>
water-soluble organic solvent such as a polyol compound or a<br>
glycol ether compound. Preferably, a polyol compound or a<br>
glycol ether compound having a carbon number of eight or<br>
larger may be suitably used.<br>
If the carbon number of the polyol compound is<br>
less than eight, sufficient permeability may not be obtained,<br>
resulting in staining the recording medium during both-side<br>
printing. This may also result in decrease in character<br>
quality or image density due to the insufficient spread of ink<br>
over the recording medium and poorer filling of the pixels.<br><br>
Preferable examples of the polyol compound having<br>
the carbon number of eight or greater include 2-ethyl 1,3-<br>
hexanediol (solubility: 4.2% (25 *C)), and 2,2,4-trimethyl<br>
1,3-pentanediol (solubility: 2.0% (25 °C) ) .<br>
The added amount of the penetrant is not<br>
particularly limited but may be appropriately selected<br>
depending on the purpose. Preferably, the added amount of the<br>
penetrant is 0.1 to 20% by mass and more preferably 0.5 to 10%<br>
by mass.<br>
Surfactant<br>
The surfactant is not particularly limited and<br>
may be appropriately selected depending on the purpose.<br>
Examples are an anion surfactant, a nonionic surfactant, an<br>
amphoteric surfactant, and a fluorine surfactant.<br>
A preferable example of the fluorinated<br>
surfactant is represented by the following general formula:<br>
CF3CF2(CF2CF2)m-CH2CH2O(CH2CH2O)nH	(A)<br>
where m is an integer of from 0 to 10, and n is an integer of<br>
from 1 to 40.<br>
Examples of the fluorinated surfactant include a<br>
perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid compound, a perfluoroalkyl<br>
carvone compound, a perfluoroalkyl phosphoric ester compound,<br><br>
a perfluoroalkyl ethylene oxide adduct, and a polyoxyalkylene<br>
ether polymer compound having a perfluoroalkylether group as a<br>
side chain. Among those, a polyoxyalkylene ether polymer<br>
compound having a perfluoroalkylether group as a side chain is<br>
particularly preferable from the safety standpoint because it<br>
has a low foaming property and a low fluorine compound<br>
bioaccumulation potential, which is seen as a problem in<br>
recent years.<br>
Examples of the perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid<br>
compounds include perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid and<br>
perfluoroalkyl sulfonate.<br>
Examples of the perfluoroalkyl carvone compounds<br>
include perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid and perfluoroalkyl<br>
carboxylate.<br>
Examples of the perfluoroalkyl phosphoric ester<br>
compounds include perfluoroalkyl phosphoric ester and a salt<br>
of perfluoroalkyl phosphoric ester.<br>
Examples of the polyoxyalkylene ether polymer<br>
compounds having a perfluoroalkylether group as a side chain<br>
include a polyoxyalkylene ether polymer having a<br>
perfluoroalkylether group as a side chain, a sulfate ester<br>
salt of a polyoxyalkylene ether polymer having a<br>
perfluoroalkylether group as a side chain, and a salt of a<br>
polyoxyalkylene ether polymer having a perfluoroalkylether<br>
group as a side chain.<br><br>
Counter ions of salts in the above fluorinated<br>
surfactants include Li, Na, K, NH4, NH3CH2CH2OH, NH2 (CH2CH2OH) 2,<br>
and NH(CH2CH2OH)3.<br>
The fluorinated surfactant may be appropriately<br>
synthesized, or a commercially available product may be used.<br>
Examples of the commercially available<br>
fluorinated surfactant include Surflon S-lll, S-112, S-113, S-<br>
121, S-131, 53-132, S-141, S-145 (Asahi Glass Co., Ltd.);<br>
Fluorad FC-93, FC-95, FC-98, FC-129, FC-135, FC-170C, FC-430,<br>
FC-431 (Sumitomo 3M Limited); Megafac F-470, F1405, F-<br>
474(Dainippon Ink and Chemicals, Incorporated); Zonyl TBS,<br>
FSP, FSA, FSN-100, FSN, FSO-100, FSO, FS-300, UR (DuPont); FT-<br>
110, FT-250, FT-251, FT-400S, FT-150, FT-400SW (NEOS Co.<br>
Ltd.); and PF-151N (Omnova Solutions, Inc.). Among the above,<br>
Zonyl FS-300, FSN, FSN-100, and FSO (DuPont) are particularly<br>
preferable from the viewpoint of reliability and color<br>
development.<br>
Other components<br>
The aforementioned other components are not<br>
particularly limited and may be appropriately selected as<br>
needed. Examples are a resin emulsion, a pH adjuster, an<br>
antiseptic or a fungicide, a rust inhibitor, an antioxidant,<br>
an ultraviolet absorber, an oxygen absorber, and a light<br>
stabilizer.<br><br>
Resin emulsion<br>
The resin emulsion is a dispersion of resin<br>
particles in water as a continuous phase. It may contain a<br>
dispersing agent such as a surfactant as needed.<br>
Generally, the content of resin particles as a<br>
disperse phase component (i.e., the content of the resin<br>
particles in the resin emulsion) is preferably 10 to 70% by<br>
mass. The average particle size of the resin particles is<br>
preferably 10 to 1000 nm and more preferably 20 to 300 ran from<br>
the viewpoint of use in an inkjet recording apparatus.<br>
The added amount of resin particles in the resin<br>
emulsion with respect to the ink is preferably 0.1 to 50% by<br>
mass, more preferably 0.5 to 20% by mass, and further more<br>
preferably 1 to 10% by mass. When the added amount is less<br>
than 0.1% by mass, sufficient improvements in clogging<br>
resistance or discharge stability may not be obtained. When<br>
the added amount is more than 50% by mass, the preservation<br>
stability of the ink may be reduced.<br>
The viscosity of the ink is preferably 1 to 30<br>
cPs and more preferably 2 to 20 cPs at temperature of 20 °C.<br>
When the viscosity is higher than 20 cPs, sufficient discharge<br>
stability may not be obtained.<br>
The pH of the ink is preferably 7 to 10.<br><br>
The color of the ink is not particularly limited<br>
and may be appropriately selected depending on the purpose.<br>
Examples are yellow, magenta, cyan, and black. A multi-color<br>
image can be formed by using an ink set of two or more of such<br>
colors. A full-color image can be formed by using a set of<br>
inks of all of the colors.<br>
In the following, exemplary ink preparations are<br>
described. However, the present invention is not limited to<br>
any of those examples.<br>
Preparation Example 1<br>
- Preparation of dispersion of polymer particles containing<br>
copper phthalocyanine pigment -<br>
The atmosphere of a 1L flask equipped with a<br>
mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, a nitrogen gas inlet tube,<br>
a reflux tube, and a dropping funnel was substituted<br>
sufficiently with nitrogen gas. The 1L flask was then charged<br>
with 11.2 g of styrene, 2.8 g of acrylic acid, 12.0 g of<br>
lauryl methacrylate, 4.0 g of polyethylene glycol<br>
methacrylate, 4.0 g of styrene macromer (Toagosei Co., Ltd.,<br>
brand name: AS-6), and 0.4 g of mercaptoethanol, and the<br>
temperature was raised to 65 °C. Then, a mixture solution of<br>
100.8 g of styrene, 25.2 g of acrylic acid, 108.0 g of lauryl<br>
methacrylate, 36.0 g of polyethylene glycol methacrylate, 60.0<br>
g of hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 36.0 g of styrene macromer<br><br>
(Toagosei Co., Ltd., brand name: AS-6), 3.6 g of<br>
mercaptoethanol, 2.4 g of azobisdimethylvaleronitrile, and 18<br>
g of methyl ethyl ketone was added dropwise into the flask<br>
over a period of 2.5 hours.<br>
After the dripping was completed, a mixture<br>
solution of 0.8 g of azobisdimethylvaleronitrile and 18 g of<br>
methyl ethyl ketone was added dropwise into the flask over a<br>
period of 0.5 hours. After the resulting solution was matured<br>
for 1 hour at the temperature of 65 °C, 0.8 g of<br>
azobisdimethylvaleronitrile was added, and the solution was<br>
further matured over a period of 1 hour. After the reaction<br>
was over, 364 g of methyl ethyl ketone was put into the flask,<br>
obtaining 800 g of a polymer solution with a concentration of<br>
50% by mass. A portion of the obtained polymer solution was<br>
dried and then measured by gel permeation chromatography<br>
(standard: polystyrene, solvent: tetrahydrofuran). The<br>
weight-average molecular weight (Mw) was 15,000.<br>
Next, 28 g of the obtained polymer solution, 26 g<br>
of copper phthalocyanine pigment, 13.6 g of 1 mol/L potassium<br>
hydroxide solution, 20 g of methyl ethyl ketone, and 30 g of<br>
ion-exchanged water were mixed and stirred sufficiently. The<br>
resulting substance was kneaded 20 times using a tripole roll<br>
mill (NR-84A from Noritake Co., Limited). The obtained paste<br>
was put in 200 g of ion-exchanged water. After sufficiently<br>
stirring, methyl ethyl ketone and water were distilled away<br><br>
with an evaporator. As a result, 160 g of a blue polymer<br>
particle dispersion having a solid content of 20.0% by mass<br>
was obtained.<br>

in the same manner as in Preparation Example 1 with the<br><br>
exception that the copper phthalocyanine pigment was replaced<br>
with C. I. Pigment Yellow 74.<br>
The average particle size (D50%) of the resultant<br>
polymer particles as measured with a particle size<br>
distribution analyzer (Microtrac UPA, Nikkiso Co., Ltd.) was<br>

Preparation Example 4<br>
- Preparation of dispersion of carbon black processed with<br>
sulfonating agent -<br>
150 g of a commercially available carbon black<br>
pigment (Printex #85, Degussa) was well mixed in 400 ml of<br>
sulfolane. After micro-dispersing with a beads mill, 15 g of<br>
amidosulfuric acid was added to the solution, which was then<br>
stirred for 10 hours at 140-150 °C. The resultant slurry was<br>
put in 1000 ml of ion-exchanged water, and the solution was<br>
centrifuged at 12,000 rpm. As a result, a surface-treated<br>
carbon black wet cake was obtained. The obtained carbon black<br>
wet cake was dispersed again in 2,000 ml of ion-exchanged<br>
water. After adjusting the pH with lithium hydroxide, the<br>
solution was desalted/condensed using a ultrafilter, obtaining<br>
a carbon black dispersion with a pigment concentration of 10%<br>
by mass, which was then filtered with a nylon filter with an<br>
average pore diameter of 1 p.<br><br>
