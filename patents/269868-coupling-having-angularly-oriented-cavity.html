COUPLING HAVING ANGUlARLY ORIENTED CAVITY<br>
Cross-Reference to Related Application<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/730,305, filed October 26, 2005.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to mechcanical couplings for joining pipe elements together in end-to-end relation.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Mechanical pipe couplings are used throughout a broad spectrum of industry, for example, in mining, petroleum extraction and refining, chemical production as well as in fire protection systems used in office buildings, warehouses, schools and the like.  Mechanical couplings provide significant advantages over other methods of joining pipe elements together, for example, welding or brazing, in that they allow for the assembly of a fluid carrying piping network by relatively unskilled labor using simple tools.  The term "pipe elements" is used herein to denote any pipe-like item or component having a pipe-like form.  Pipe elements include pipe stock, pipe fittings such as elbows, caps and tees as well as fluid control components such as valves, reducers, strainers, restrictors, pressure regulators and the like.<br>
Figure 1 shows an example of a mechanical pipe coupling 10 according to the prior art.  Coupling 10 comprises two (or more) segments 12 and 14 that are positionable straddling a sealing member 16 and pipe elements 18 and 20.  Each coupling segment 12 and 14 has arcuate surfaces 22 and 24 that respectively engage the pipe elements 18 and 2 0 to secure them<br><br>
in end to end relation.  In the example shown in Figure 1, the arcuate surfaces 22 project radially inwardly and engage grooves 26 in the ends of the pipe elements.  Other examples include pipe elements having smooth ends, flared ends or raised shoulders that are engaged by the couplings.<br>
The sealing member 16 engages both pipe elements 18 and 20 and ensures a fluid-tight joint.  Sealing member 16 is preferably a flexible elastomeric ring that is positioned within a cavity 28 within the coupling defined by a pair of sidewalls 30 and 32 attached to a back wall 34.  Sealing member 15 is compressed into engagement with the pipe elements by contact with the sidewalls and back wall of the coupling segments 12 and 14 as the segments are drawn together to form the pipe joint.<br>
As shown in Figures 2 and 3, coupling segments 12 and 14 may have angularly oriented surfaces 36 and 38 positioned at opposite ends.  The slopes of the surfaces are oriented opposite to one another on each segment.  When the surfaces on two segments are positioned in facing relation, as when the segments are straddling pipe elements 18 and 20, and the segments are drawn together, sliding engagement of the surfaces causes the segments to rotate in opposite directions relatively to one another about an axis 40 that is oriented substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 4 2 of pipe elements 16 and 18.  The relative rotation of the segments 12 and 14 is desirable because it forces the arcuate surfaces 22 and 24 into engagement with the side surfaces of grooves 26 in the pipe elements and adds rigidity to the joint about all axes, i.e., bending and torsion, as well as preventing axial expansion or contraction.<br><br>
In addition to the angularly oriented surfaces described herein, there are other means for effecting relative rotation of the coupling segments, such as the crescent shaped protrusion interfitting within the crescent shaped groove as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,246,257, hereby incorporated by reference, or the use of offset apertures in attachment flanges as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,861,075, also hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
To connect segments 12 and 14, each segment has connection members positioned at opposite ends of the segments.  In the example illustrated in Figures 2 and 3, the connection members comprise projections 44 in the form of lugs that extend outwardly from the segments.  The projections have apertures 46 that receive fasteners such as bolts 48 and nuts 50 which, when tightened, cause the segments 12 and 14 to be drawn toward one another.<br>
While it is advantageous in certain circumstances to increase the rigidity of the joint by rotating the coupling segments about axis 40, this rotation of the segments deforms the sealing member 16 through its engagement with the sidewalls 30 and 32. It is preferable not to distort the shape of the sealing member through rotation of the segments.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention concerns interconnectable pipe coupling segments, each positionable straddling a sealing member and end portions of a pair of pipe elements engaged with the sealing member for securing the pipe elements together in end-to-end relationship.  Each segment comprises a pair of arcuate surfaces adapted to interface with the outer surfaces of the pipe elements.  First and second connection members are<br><br>
positioned at opposite ends of the arcuate surfaces for adjustably connecting one coupling segment to another.  The connection members are adjustably tightenable for drawing the segments together.  First and second angularly oriented surfaces are positioned adjacent to the first and second connection members respectively.  The angularly oriented surfaces have opposite slopes.  The angularly oriented surfaces on one segment are positionable in facing relation with angularly oriented surfaces on another segment and engage one another when the segments are drawn together.  Engagement of the surfaces causes the segments to rotate relatively to one another about an 'axis oriented substantially perpendicularly to the pipe elements.  A concavity is positioned between the arcuate surfaces and extends circumferentially around the segment.  The concavity is oriented angularly with respect to the -axis to receive the sealing member.  In another embodiment, the cavity is divided into a plurality of sectors, at least one of the sectors being oriented angularly with respect to the axis.  In a particular embodiment, the segment has three sectors, two of which are located at opposite ends of the segment.  These two sectors are angularly oriented with respect to the aforementioned axis.<br>
The invention also includes a pipe coupling positionable straddling a sealing member and end portions of a pair of pipe elements for securing the pipe elements together in end-to-end relationship.  The pipe coupling comprises a pair of the coupling segments as described above.<br>
The invention further includes a method of securing facing end portions of pipe elements together in end-to-end relationship.  The method comprises:<br><br>
(a)	providing a pipe coupling having a pair of coupling segments attached to one another end-to-end, the coupling segments each having arcuate surfaces adapted to interface with the outer surfaces of the pipes, the coupling segments each having a concavity positioned between the arcuate surfaces and extending circumferentially around the segments, the concavity being adapted to receive a sealing member, the concavity being oriented angularly with respect to an axis oriented substantially perpendicular to the pipe elements;<br>
(b)	positioning the end portions of the pipe elements between the segments;<br>
(c)	drawing the coupling segments into engagement with the outer surfaces of the pipe elements;<br>

Detailed Description of the Embodiments<br>
Figures 4 and 5 show a pipe coupling segment 52 according to the invention.  Segment 52 has arcuate surfaces 54 and 56 adapted to interface with the outer surfaces of pipe elements. A cavity 58 is positioned between the arcuate surfaces.  The cavity is defined by sidewalls 60 and 62 and a back wall 64 attached to the sidewalls.  Angularly oriented surfaces 66 and 68 are positioned at each end of the coupling segment.  The surfaces 66 and 68 have opposite slopes, and when they engage similar surfaces on another segment in facing relation they cause the coupling segments to rotate in opposite directions<br><br>
relatively to one another about an axis 70 that is substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the pipe elements being joined by the coupling.  Connection members 72 and 74 are positioned at opposite ends of the coupling segment 52.  In this example the connection members comprise lugs having apertures 75 adapted to receive fasteners such as bolts and nuts for connection of two coupling segments together straddling pipe elements.<br>
In the embodiment showm in Figures 4 and 5, cavity 58 has an angular orientation with an orientation, angle 78 measured about the rotation axis 70 relative to a datum line 80 that extends between the connection members 70 and 72.  The orientation angle 78 of cavity 58 is defined by the angle 82 of the sidewalls 60 and 62 relative to a line 81 parallel to the datum line 80.  Orientation angle 78 is preferably less than 4' for practical designs, and may range between 1/4" and 4" depending upon the coupling size and degree of rotation of the coupling segments.  The orientation angle 78 is oriented in a direction opposite to that of the direction of relative rotation of the coupling segment 52 when engaged with another coupling segment.  This arrangement of the orientation angle compensates for the rotation of the coupling segment so that the sealing member, which is substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the pipe elements (i.e., aligned with datum line 80), is not distorted by interaction with the sidewalls 60 and 62 and back wall 64 when the coupling segment rotates about axis 70.  Cavity 56 is, thus, angled so that, despite the fact that the coupling segments rotate relative to the pipe elements and the sealing member, the sealing member is received substantially squarely within the cavity and is not distorted by forced contact with one of the sidewalls as a result of the rotation.<br><br>
When coupling segments 52 are attached to one another surrounding a sealing member and pipe elements in a manner similar to that shown in Figures 1 and 2, they will be initially skewed in opposite directions due to the sidewalls of the cavities engaging the sealing member, the cavities being angularly oriented as described above.  As the segments are brought towards the pipe elements, the arcuate surfaces 54 and 56 may not initially align with the grooves in the pipe elements due to the initial skew of the segments.  As a result, the arcuate surfaces may not properly engage the grooves.  To lessen the chance of such misalignment, it is advantageous to chamfer the outer regions 83 of the arcuate surfaces 54 and 56 where they are expected to make first contact with the grooves in the pipe elements.<br>
In another coupling segment embodiment 84, shown in Figures 6 and 7, the cavity 86 is divided into a plurality of sectors.  In this example, there are three sectors, two end sectors 88 and 90 positioned at opposite ends of segment 84, and a middle sector 92 positioned between the end sectors. When three sectors are present, it is advantageous that each end sector subtend an angle 94 of about 45' and the middle sector subtend an angle 96 of about 90* .  Other angular distributions are also feasible.<br>
The end sectors 88 and 90 of cavity 86 are differentiated from the middle sector 92 by their angular orientation. Preferably, the end sectors 88 and 90 have respective orientation angles 98 and 100 less than about 6' and more preferably between about 1/4* and about 6* while the middle sector 92 is not angularly oriented as defined herein.<br><br>
Preferably, the orientation angles 98 and 100 of the end sectors have the same magnitude and slope.<br>
The coupling segments are preferably cast from ductile iron but could also be molded in plastic or machined from a metal billet.  It is advantageous to impart the angular orientation of the cavity during casting of the segments rather than by machining after casting.  The configuration having a plurality of sectors provides advantages in the preparation of the pattern for casting of the coupling segment.  This is especially advantageous for couplings which deform to conform with the shape of the pipe elements. Because the linear motion of the segments during rotation about axis 70 is greatest at each end, it is feasible to angularly orient only the end sectors and leave the middle sector unaffected.  The relatively limited traversal of the middle sector tends to have less distorting effect on the sealing member than the end sectors, which traverse the greater distance upon rotation by virtue of their greater distance from the axis of rotation.<br>
Although the example couplings shown herein have two segments and angularly oriented surfaces to effect relative rotation of the segments, the angularly oriented cavity is applicable to prevent sealing member distortion in any style coupling wherein the segments are rotated relatively to one another out of the plane of the coupling.  Further examples include couplings having 4 or more segments as well as couplings having different means for effecting relative rotation.<br><br><br>
