METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DIABETIC AND AGED SKIN<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to methods and compositions for prevention and/or treatment of skin pathologies and disorders associated with diabetes and/or aging. More particularly, the present invention relates to the use of various agents capable of restoring impaired physiological conditions of the skin associated with skin pathologies or disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Skin physiology and architecture<br>
Skin is composed of a myriad of cell types, acting together to maintain overall tissue function. Normal skin physiology and architecture is dependent on the cross talk between these cells, encompassing even more intricate intracellular signaling mechanisms. The delicate balance between biochemical processes is the focus point of all physiological outcomes. This balance is the basis by which the skin exerts its physiological functions including the formation of a pathogenic barrier, modulation of the immune response, serving as an homeostatic barrier (i.e. fluid regulation), and controlling body temperature. Skin pathologies transpire when this balance is compromised and thus non desired physiological routes are expressed.<br>
Skin is a complex tissue organized in distinct layers, namely, the epidermis, dermis and hypodermis, each possessing a different cell characterization and physiological significance (Schaefer and Redelmeier, 1996).<br>
The epidermis is stratified squamous epithelium in which cells undergoing growth and differentiation are strictly compartmentalized (Schaefer and Redelmeier, 1996). In a normal physiologic state, proliferation is confined to the basal cells that adhere to the basement membrane. Differentiation is a spatial process in which<br><br><br>
basal cells lose their adhesion to the basement membrane, cease DNA synthesis and undergo a series of morphological and biochemical changes. The ultimate maturation step is the production of the cornified layer forming the protective barrier of the skin (Tennenbaum et al., 1991; Wysocki, 1999).<br>
The dermis is mainly composed of matrix fibers and contains various cell types. In addition, all skin appendages, namely, microvasculature, sweat and sebaceous glands, sensory nerves and hair follicles, are localized in the dermis. The dermis has been attributed the supporting role of skin nourishment, maintaining the epidermis and the route by which signals from other parts of the body reach the outer layer (Tennenbaum et al., 1991; Wysocki, 1999).<br>
The hypodermis is the deepest layer of the skin, mainly consisting of adipose cells, also known as the subcutaneous fat layer. Until recently, this layer has been thought to have the role of insulation from the external temperature changes and mechanical support to the upper layers of the skin (Jackson et al., 1993). Only recently, the endocrine significance of fat tissue (Pantanetti et al, 2004; Fliers et al., 2003), specifically the visceral fat tissue, has been acknowledged and identified as playing a role in glucose regulation in diabetes development and progression (Laviola et al, 2006; Maianu, 2001). Moreover, recent publications have identified the potential impact of subcutaneous adipocytes, which secrete several cytokines and growth factors that can affect skin physiology and regeneration (Nakagami et al., 2006).<br>
Insulin signaling in sldn<br>
The insulin receptor is an insulin-regulated tyrosine kinase. Insulin binding to its receptor results in receptor activation via autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues on several regions of the intracellular p-subunit. Subsequently insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins are tyrosine phosphorylated and activated. Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-proteins generate downstream signals by the direct binding to the SH2 domains of various signaling proteins. Several enzymes and adaptor proteins have been identified to associate with IRS-1 and IRS-2, including<br><br><br>
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), phosphotyrosine phosphatase SHP2, Grb2, Nek, and Crk. The products of the she gene are also substrates of the insulin receptor since they contain SIC domains and are tyrosine phosphorylated in response to insulin (White, 1997).<br>
One of the earliest steps in the insulin signaling pathway is the activation of PI 3-kinase. Once activated, the catalytic subunit phosphorylates phosphoinositides at the 3' position of the inositol ring or proteins at serine residues. PI3K activates downstream molecules such as PtdIns(3,4)P2/ PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), which activates serine kinase Akt. Akt in turn deactivates glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), leading to activation of glycogen synthase and thus glycogen synthesis. Activation of Akt also results in the translocation of GLUT4 vesicles from their intracellular pool to the plasma membrane (Chang et ah, 2004; Ishiki and Klip, 2005). Other targets of Akt include mTOR-mediated activation of protein synthesis by PHAS/elf4 and p70s6k and cell survival mechanisms represented by BAD (Bcl-2/Bcl-XL antagonist) and IKK (I-KB Kinase). Other signal transduction proteins which interact with IRS molecules include Grb2 and SHP2. Flanking its SH2-domain, Grb2 contains two SH3-domains that associate constitutively with proline rich regions in mSOS, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that stimulates GDP/GTP exchange on Ras. Activated Ras recruits Raf, a serine/threonine kinase to the plasma membrane. Raf activation results in the activation of MEK by phosphorylation of two serine residues. MEK is a dual specificity kinase that activates MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) by both tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation. MAPK acts as an activator of some transcriptional factors (Myc, NF-kB, AP-1), kinases (Rsk), cell survival proteins (BcI-2, cPL-2) and structural proteins (paxillin) (Taha and Klip, 1999). In addition, insulin stimulates the activation of PKC isoforrns in several tissues and cell types. It has also been reported that PKC isoforrns may form complexes with the IR and phosphorylate several molecules involved in IR-initiated signaling, inhibiting their function. Among serine/threonine kinases, a crucial role in modulating insulin signals is played by the PKC family members (Farese et al., 2005). For instance,<br><br><br>
PKCa has been reported to inhibit insulin action in both cellular and animal models. Overexpression of PKCa, has been shown to inhibit insulin signaling in cultured cell systems. Murine models of PKCa gene ablation also exhibit increased sensitivity to insulin, further supporting the concept of the PKCa negative role in insulin signaling by targeting insulin toward degradation. Insulin down stream signaling also involves the specific activation of PKC£ and PKCp (Formisano et al, 2000). In addition, in skin, insulin was shown to regulate skin proliferation via PKC5 activation and transcriptional regulation of STAT3 (Gartsbein et al, 2006). Insulin also stimulates the formation of a multimolecular complex, including IRS-1 and PKC8; PKCa inhibits IR/IRS-1 signaling and regulates insulin degradation. Insulin plays an important role in the overall regulation of protein synthesis. Some of the effects of insulin involve changes in mRNAs abundance, but insulin also has important effects on the translation process itself (Patel et al, 2006). Indeed, several initiation and elongation factors are regulated by this hormone, often as a consequence of changes in their states of phosphorylation.<br>
Skin pathologies in diabetes<br>
Skin pathologies are a common complication of diabetes, most of which are associated with progression of metabolic defects and some appear with higher incidence in diabetic patients (Wertheimer, 2004; Wertheimer and Enk, 2001). There have been reports indicating specific alteration in skin structure as well as characteristic pathologies of skin associated with the diabetic state. Diabetic patients exhibit dryer, thinner skin with a flakier outer layer; they are more exposed to skin infections caused by both bacterial and fungal sources (Wang and Margolis, 2006; Muller et al, 2005). Moreover, skin elasticity is compromised in diabetic patients similarly to skin in elderly patients, thus, having a higher tendency to break and injure (Yoon et al, 2002; Montagna and Carlisle, 1979; West, 1994). Specifically, thinned skin exhibits a reduction in rete ridges, which undermines the skins' ability to control temperature and fluid homeostasis. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the rete ridges serve as the enriched stem cell population of human skin.<br><br><br>
Therefore, it is clear that the rete ridges attenuation in the structure of diabetic skin results in depletion of the skin stem cell population and leads to severe impairment in skin function and remodeling (Wertheimer, 2004).<br>
Numerous pathologies and disorders specifically associated with diabetic skin pathologies and disorders have been reported in the medical literature. These include (i) necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum (NLD) - appears in various stages of diabetes progression. Lesions appear circumscribed, erythematous plaques with a depressed waxy telangiectativ center characteristic of lower extremities; (ii) granuloma annulare - a chronic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology characterized by erythematous plaques in distal extremities. Lesions are associated with advanced stages of type I diabetes; (iii) diabetic dermopaihy - the most common lesion in adult diabetes, associated with the duration of the diabetic state and the appearance of other diabetic complications. Lesions appear as multiple round or oval pink to brown painless plaques; (iv) bullosis diabeticorum - bullous lesions distinctive of long term diabetes, associated with a reduced threshold to blister formation; (v) limited joint mobility - characterized by joint contractures and collagen deposition in the skin. Lesions are thought to result from changes in collagen packing, cross linking and turnover; (vi) scleredema diabeticorum -characterized by a dramatic increase in skin thickness of the posterior neck and upper back; (vii) acanthosis nigricans (AN) - lesions of dark pigmented skin which appears in body folds of the neck and axilla, associated with insulin resistance together with hyperinsulinemia; (viii) acquired perforating dermatosis - lesions characterized by transepithelial elimination of dermal components in perforating skin; (ix) insulin allergy - dermatologic side effects of continuous treatment with insulin and or hypoglycemic agents, often appears as a maculopapular rash or a pain itching erythema at injection sites; and (x) cutaneous skin infections - a common incidence in diabetic patients presenting the leading cause of morbidity and mortality (Wertheimer, 2004).<br>
Another common denominator in these skin pathologies is the effect on the immune system of the skin, which leads to a compromise in the skins' ability to<br><br><br>
fight off external pathogens (Wang and Margolis, 2006; Muller et al., 2005). In addition, diabetic skin exhibits an impaired immune response to changes in the skin architecture brought by the metabolic complications. Such lesions result from delayed type hypersensitivity, accumulation of activated histocytes (foam cells) in the skin layers or an immune mediated response contributing to the changes in the. dermis (Wertheimer, 2004). In addition, diabetic skin has been found to be constantly infected with either microbial or fungal sources due to its reduced ability to effectively react to exogenic infections. These opportunistic agents take advantage of the impaired immune response and pose a constant aggravation to patients (Wang and Margolis, 2006; Muller etal, 2005).<br>
Skin disorders in aging<br>
Skin changes are among the most visible signs of aging. Evidence of increasing age include wrinkles and sagging skin. Aging changes in the skin are a group of common conditions and developments that occur as people grow older. With aging, the outer skin layer (epidermis) thins even though the number of cell layers remains unchanged. The number of pigment-containing cells (melanocytes) decreases. Aging skin thus appears thinner, more pale, and translucent. Large pigmented spots, called age spots, liver spots or lentigos, may appear in sun-exposed areas. The subcutaneous fat layer (hypodermis), which provides insulation and padding, thins. This increases the risk of skin injury and reduces the ability to maintain body temperature. More than 90% of all older people have some type of skin disorder.<br>

As used herein, the terms "diabetic skin" and "skin pathology, disorder or condition associated with diabetes" are used interchangeably to define a skin disorder that is caused by diabetes or is affected by diabetes. Some of these disorders are conditions that anyone can have but to which people with diabetes are particularly prone, such as atherosclerotic skin changes, bacterial and fungal infections of the skin, and itching. Other diabetic skin diseases are seen mainly or exclusively in people with diabetes and include those pathologies summarized in Table 1, in which the compartmentalization of the different pathologies to affected cells/tissues, enables better understanding of the disorders and treatment of the common impairments associated with diabetic skin.<br>

By focusing on the cells and biochemical changes in the different skin cells we are able to further compartmentalize the diabetes-related skin complications. Specifically, epidermal-related defects can be associated either to impaired proliferation/differentiation ratio or breach of cell-cell or cell-matrix (basement membrane) contact (Wertheimer et al., 2001; Alt et al, 2001). Dermal/matrix-related defects may be influenced by the differentiation capacity of fibroblast inhabiting the dermal layer. Fibroblasts, the most common cell type in the dermis, are known to be responsible for the collagen and elastin fiber network synthesis and maintenance. In the dermis, fibroblasts are found in all differentiation stages from<br><br><br>
stem cells through intermediate stages and the fully differentiated committed fibroblast. It is the mature cell that is responsible for matrix formation (Freinkel and Woodley, 2001); thus, any disturbance in fibroblast differentiation may contribute to matrix imperfections. In addition, fibroblast depletion by reduced proliferation might also contribute to impaired matrix formation and /or maintenance.<br>
Concomitantly, adipose cell in the hypodermis are also dependent on their dedifferentiation state in order to exert their endocrine role in skin physiology (Gregoire,2001).<br>
The inventors of the present invention have developed a reliable technique for quantitatively identifying the critical parameters in skin physiology. These parameters are specifically linked to signaling pathways leading to physiological processes including proliferation, migration, differentiation, matrix formation and maintenance. Establishing the link between the parameters is of great importance in primary prevention and treatment of skin complications of diabetic patients. Thus, by underlying the biochemical regulation of these processes, we are able to control specific signaling pathways leading to the desired physiological endpoints. It is important to take into consideration that many of these pathways interact and influence each other, implying that only a combined regulation will be able to effectively direct the desired outcome.<br>
From our observations it is clear that the epidermis of diabetic skin exhibits a disrupted basal layer where the cells appear with large nuclei and are not set vertically as in normal skin. It can be also observed that the elastin in the dermis disappears from under the epidermis and disintegration is characteristic of fibers in the deeper part of the dermis. Concurrently, there have been reports that diabetic skin exhibits a reduction in fibroblast number which is the rationale for the reduction in procollagen and thus reduced collagen content (Varani et al, 2006). Advanced glycation endproduct formation, caused by the consistent hyperglycemia, have been thought to affect directly various skin structures such as the microvasculature, dermal collagen fibers and basement membrane (Yang et al., I     2003). Hyperglycemia has also been shown to have a direct effect on the epidermal<br><br><br>
keratinocytes, modifying their ability to proliferate and differentiate (Spravchikov et aU 2000).<br>
Our results in accordance with the present invention further imply a crucial role for subcutaneous adipocytes in diabetes complications in skin. Progression of diabetes and deterioration of skin elasticity and strength is directly linked to the disregulation of adipocytes differentiation and distribution leading to the loss of the hypodermis tissue/subcutaneous fat layer. In addition, the diabetic state affects the immune response of skin thus preventing its proper function in guarding the skin from pathogens and stress-related disorders (Tingo et al, 2006). Taken together, it is clear that the diabetic metabolic syndrome directly affects skin through various routes and involves almost every skin-related cell.<br>
While diabetic skin is unique in its characteristics, some of the diabetic associated pathologies resemble defects characteristic of the aging state. Therefore, a similar approach can be directed to revitalizing aging skin to induce skin rejuvenation.<br>
Thus the defects found in diabetic patients in general, including aged diabetic patients, and in non-diabetic aging individuals, can be corrected in accordance with the present invention specifically by renewal of the various cell layers of skin, particularly the hypodermis layer. This is a novel approach to correct esthetic defects, restore elasticity and rejuvenate skin in diabetic and non-diabetic individuals and to prevent appearance or recurrence of a pathology associated with diabetic skin.<br>
In one aspect, the present invention provides a method for treating or preventing a skin pathology, disorder or condition associated with diabetes and/or aging, comprising topically administering to the skin of a diabetic and/or aging individual a therapeutically or cosmetically effective amount of at least one agent capable of restoring an impaired physiological condition of the skin associated with said skin pathology, disorder or condition.<br>
As used herein, the term "impaired physiological condition of the skin associated with said skin pathology or disorder", when related to the diabetic skin,<br><br><br>
refers to all pathologies that impair biochemical balance and structure of the skin, such as disappearance of the hypodermis adipose layer; impaired integrity of the epidermis layer through the disrupted regulation of the differentiation process and proliferation capacity, which is frequent in diabetic skin; dermis exhibition of disseminated matrix deposition affecting collagen distribution, elastic fibers destruction and enhanced inflammatory response throughout all skin layers, which are characteristic of diabetic skin. As a result of these changes of the physiological conditions, distinct skin pathologies specific to the diabetic state are induced, as specified herein in the specification. In addition, these impairments induce also general changes such as thinning, dryness, abundance of skin tags and loss of general esthetics. As far as aged skin is concerned, in addition to changes in matrix deposition and dermis structures, which are known, the term also refers to a unique impairment in the hypodermis layer, which we have characterized in the present invention, which leads to the impairment of aging skin including impaired elasticity, thinning, wrinkles, etc. The term also refers to the biochemical impairments in the insulin signaling pathway, PKC pathways and adipokine secretion in diabetic and aged skin that specifically cause structural pathological manifestations including changes in epidermis, dermis and uniquely in the hypodermis. As we recognized the main molecules and their role in these skin problems, we show herein several possible pathway-related treatments which overcome the impairments associated with diabetic and aging skin.<br>
The in vitro and in vivo models developed and described in Material and Methods section hereinafter, allow quantification of stage-specific changes in the normal and diabetic skin. Our models provide the utilization of morphological, histological and immunohistochemical analysis for the identification of target specific modulators facilitating the formulation of efficient treatments.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the at least one agent is a PKC isoform modulator capable of modulating the expression and/or activity of at least one PKC isoform.<br><br><br>
The term "PKC isoform" as used herein encompasses all PKC isoforms including PKCa, PKCp (including both PKCpl and PKCp2), PKC-5, PKC-B, PKC-r|, PKC-C, PKC-y, PKC-9, PKC-?. and PKC-i. In preferred embodiments, the PKC isoform is PKCa, PKC8, PKCe or PKC£.<br>
The phrase "modulating expression and/or activity of a PKC isoform" relates to an increased or reduced expression and/or activity of a PKC isoform. Increase of the expression leads to increased production of the PKC isoform. The term "PKC activator" is used herein interchangeably with the term "PKC isoform activator" to describe a molecule that enhances expression and/or activity of a PKC isoform.<br>
The term "PKC inhibitor" is used herein interchangeably with the term "PKC isoform inhibitor" to describe a molecule that inhibits expression and/or activity of a PKC isoform.<br>
Among others, the phosphoryl transfer region, the pseudosubstrate domain, the phorbolester binding sequences, and the phosphorylation sites may be targets for modulation of isoenzyme-specific PKC activity (Hofmann, 1997). It should be understood that many modulators are not specific and sometimes the modulator may be both inhibitor and activator.<br>
In one embodiment, the at least one agent is a PKC isoform inhibitor, which may be a PKC isoform pseudosubstrate inhibitor, a peptide binding to the PKC isoform substrate region, a peptide binding to the ATP-binding site of a PKC isoform, or Copolymer-1.<br>
The "pseudosubstrate region" or autoinhibitory domain of a PKC isoform is defined as a consensus sequence of substrates for the kinase with no phosphorylatable residue. The pseudosubstrate domain is based in the regulatory region, closely resembling the substrate recognition motif, which blocks the recognition site and prevents phosphorylation. Thus, inhibitory peptides are obtained by replacing a phosphorylatable residue of serine (S) or tyrosine (T) by alanine (A). PKC8 is the only PKC isoform known to have additional binding site enabling the isoform's activation on the C2 domain, the conserved domain 2 of PKC8(Benes etal., 2005).<br><br><br>
The ATP-binding sites of all PKC isoforms are known from the literature. Any peptide that binds to the ATP-binding site will inhibit the activity of the PKC isoform.<br>

Copolymer-1 is a synthetic polypeptide analog of myelin basic protein (MBP), which is a natural component of the myelin sheath. Chemically, Copolymer-1 is a random copolymer of the 4 amino acids L-glutamic acid, L-alanine, L-lysine and L-tyrosine. In the form of its acetate salt it is known as glatiramer acetate and has an average molecular weight of 4,700-11,000 daltons. Copolymer-1 molecules of higher molecular weight are also known (MW 15,000-18,000) and can be used according to the present invention.

The therapeutically/pharmaceutically/cosmetically active ingredients used in the present invention can be administered to the diabetic or aging skin per sc, or in a pharmaceutical or cosmetic composition mixed with suitable carriers and/or excipients. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for use in context of the present invention include those compositions in which the active ingredients are contained in an amount effective to achieve an intended therapeutic effect. Cosmetic compositions suitable for use in context of the present invention include those compositions in which the active ingredients are contained in an amount effective to achieve an intended cosmetic effect.<br>
The pharmaceutical and cosmetic compositions of the invention are intended for topical application and may be in the form of an aqueous solution, a gel, a cream, a paste, a lotion, a spray, a suspension, a powder, a dispersion, a salve, an ointment, a serum, an anhydrous stick, oil based sprays, oil-in-water emulsions or water-in-oil emulsions.<br>
The term "topical application" as used herein refers to external application to the skin, mucous membranes, teeth, hair, scalp.<br>
As used herein, the terms a "pharmaceutical composition" and a "cosmetic<br>
1 composition" refer to a preparation of one or more of the active ingredients described herein, or physiologically acceptable salts or prodrugs thereof, with other chemical components such as traditional drugs, physiologically suitable carriers and excipients suitable for therapeutic or cosmetic use. The compositions of the present invention may be manufactured by processes well known in the art, e.g., by means<br>
• of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or lyophilizing processes.<br>
Hereinafter, the phrases "pharmaceutically suitable carrier" and "cosmetically or dermatologically acceptable carrier" refer to a carrier or a diluent that does not cause significant irritation to an organism and does not abrogate the<br>
)     biological   activity   and   properties   of the   administered   ingredients.   In   the<br><br><br>
pharmaceutical compositions, inert substances are added to further facilitate processes and administration of the active ingredients and these excipients include, without limitation, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars and types of starch, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, vegetable oils and polyethylene glycols. Techniques for formulation and administration of active ingredients may be found in "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences," Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, latest edition, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
While various routes for the administration of active ingredients are possible, for the purpose of the present invention, the topical route is preferred, and is assisted by a topical carrier. The topical carrier is one, which is generally suited for topical active ingredients administration and includes any such materials known in the art. The topical carrier is selected so as to provide the composition in the desired form, e.g., as a liquid or non-liquid carrier, lotion, cream, paste, gel, powder, ointment, solvent, liquid diluent, drops and the like, and may be comprised of a material of either naturally occurring or synthetic origin. It is essential, clearly, that the selected carrier does not adversely affect the active agent or other components of the topical formulation, and which is stable with respect to all components of the topical formulation. Examples of suitable topical caniers for use herein include water, alcohols and other nontoxic organic solvents, glycerin, mineral oil, silicone, petroleum jelly, lanolin, fatty acids, vegetable oils, parabens, waxes, and the like. Preferred formulations herein are colorless, odorless ointments, liquids, lotions, creams and gels.<br>
Ointments are semisolid preparations, which are typically based on petrolatum or other petroleum derivatives. The specific ointment base to be used, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, is one that will provide for optimum active ingredients delivery, and, preferably, will provide for other desired characteristics as well, e.g., emolliency or the like. As with other carriers or vehicles, an ointment base should be inert, stable, nonirritating and nonsensitizing. As explained in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 19th Ed. )     (Easton, Pa.: Mack Publishing Co., 1995), at pages 1399-1404, ointment bases may<br><br><br>
be grouped in four classes: oleaginous bases; emulsifiable bases; emulsion bases; and water-soluble bases. Oleaginous ointment bases include, for example, vegetable oils, fats obtained from animals, and semisolid hydrocarbons obtained from petroleum. Emulsifiable ointment bases, also known as absorbent ointment bases, contain little or no water and include, for example, hydroxystearin sulfate, anhydrous lanolin and hydrophilic petrolatum. Emulsion ointment bases are either water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions or oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions, and include, for example, cetyl alcohol, glyceryl monostearate, lanolin and stearic acid. Preferred water-soluble ointment bases are prepared from polyethylene glycols of varying molecular weight; again, reference may be made to Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy for further information.<br>
Lotions are preparations to be applied to the skin surface without friction, and are typically liquid or semi liquid preparations, in which solid particles, including the active agent, are present in a water or alcohol base. Lotions are usually suspensions of solids, and may comprise a liquid oily emulsion of the oil-in-water type. Lotions are preferred formulations herein for treating large body areas, because of the ease of applying a more fluid composition. It is generally necessary that the insoluble matter in a lotion be finely divided. Lotions will typically contain suspending agents to produce better dispersions as well as compounds useful for localizing and holding the active agent in contact with the skin, e.g., methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, or the like.<br>
Creams containing the selected active ingredients are, as known in the art, viscous liquid or semisolid emulsions, either oil-in-water or water-in-oil. Cream bases are water-washable, and contain an oil phase, an emulsifier and an aqueous phase. The oil phase, also sometimes called the "internal" phase, is generally comprised of petrolatum and a fatty alcohol such as cetyl or stearyl alcohol; the aqueous phase usually, although not necessarily, exceeds the oil phase in volume, and generally contains a humectant. The emulsifier in a cream formulation, as explained in Remington, supra, is generally a nonionic, anionic, cationic or amphoteric surfactant.<br><br><br>
Gel formulations are preferred for application to the scalp. As will be appreciated by those working in the field of topical active ingredients formulation, gels are semisolid, suspension-type systems. Single-phase gels contain organic macromolecules distributed substantially uniformly throughout the carrier liquid, which is typically aqueous, but also, preferably, contains an alcohol and, optionally, an oil.<br>
Various additives, known to those skilled in the art, may be included in the topical formulations of the invention. For example, solvents may be used to solubilize certain active ingredients substances. Other optional additives include skin permeation enhancers, opacifiers, antioxidants, gelling agents, thickening agents, stabilizers, and the like.<br>
The cosmetic compositions may contain one or more emulsifiers, preservatives, thickeners, sunscreens, antioxidants, emollients, skin protectants, hair protectants. Examples of excipients usually used in the cosmetic art may be added such as, but not limited to, methylparaben, glycerin, EDTA disodium, cetearyl alcohol, ceteareth 20, propylparaben, cetyl palmitate, steareth-20, octyl stearate, polyolprepolymer-2, lecithin, and the like.<br>
The topical pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of diabetic skin pathologies and disorders may contain other pharmaceutically active agents or ingredients, used for the treatment of such pathologies and disorders. Other agents may also be added, such as antimicrobial agents, antifungal agents, antibiotics and anti-inflammatory agents.<br>
The topical cosmetic compositions for the prevention and/or treatment of diabetic and aging skin pathologies, disorders and conditions may contain additional nutrients used in anti-aging and anti-wrinkle compositions including, without limitation, Vitamins A, B, C, E and Panthenol.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions herein described may also comprise suitable solid or gel phase carriers or excipients. Examples of such carriers or excipients include, but are not limited to, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate,<br><br><br>
various sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives, gelatin and polymers such as polyethylene glycols.<br>
Dosing is dependent on the type, the severity and manifestation of the pathology or disorder and on the responsiveness of the subject to the active ingredients, as well as the dosage form employed and the potency of the particular agent(s). The doses for cosmetic use, particularly for prevention purposes, will be usually lower than the doses for pharmaceutical/therapeutic purpose.<br>
Diabetes and insulin resistance exert profound effects on skin architecture. Primarily, diabetic skin fails to present the hypodermis adipose layer; loss and irregularities of the subcutaneous adipose tissue modifies the compartmentalization of skin dermis and epidermis rendering the appearance of thinner skin. This manifestation is also characteristic of known diabetic skin pathologies such as Scleroderma Diabeticorum and leads to altered skin structure including skin thinning, flaky and dry skin, which also affect barrier function and skin elasticity. The significance of restoring the subcutaneous adipose tissue can indeed overcome many of the diabetic skin pathologies. This can be achieved according to the invention by treating diabetic skin with PKC modulating agents, various adipokines and insulin signaling related molecules, known to affect skin and adipose tissue differentiation and physiology.<br>
In addition to the abrogation of the hypodermis subcutaneous adipose tissue, abnormal structure of the epidermis and the dermis layers is observed in diabetes skin. The diabetic epidermis is thin, exhibits fewer layers and portrays a disruption in differentiation pattern demonstrated by the increased cornified envelope formation. The impaired differentiation by itself is a common base for diabetic related dermopathies. Several skin pathologies of diabetic skin are related to the interference with normal epidermal structure such as Bullosis Diabeticorum, APD and others. Thus, by influencing the regulation of specific signaling pathways involved such as insulin, PKC and MAPK we can restore the normal differentiation pattern overcoming the epidermis related diabetic skin pathologies as demonstrated in Examples 10 and 13 hereinafter.<br><br><br>
The loss of the hypodermis layer observed in the early stages of diabetes development leads also to the changes in matrix structure as we also demonstrate in Example 4. In diabetic skin the dermis appears to be disorganized and markedly reduced in size. Elastic fibers are reduced and matrix deposition is altered. These manifestations resemble human diabetic pathologies such as diabetic dermopathy and NLD. Furthermore, the proliferation capacity in diabetic slcin is compromised underling these pathologies. Restoration of the dermal layer, improved matrix deposition and skin strength can be achieved by induction of PKC modulating factors, insulin signaling related factors and adipokines as demonstrated in Example 8 hereinafter. This can also be achieved by induction of hypodermis adipose tissue formation. These results further demonstrate the importance of adipose tissue integrity and secreted factors to the correction of impairments characteristic of diabetes skin. Moreover, diabetic skin displays a tendency of an increased inflammatory response which also leads to severe complications in skin of diabetic patients. Utilization of PKC modulators can specifically and efficiently reduce the abnormal inflammatory response.<br>
In light of the increase of the diabetic patient population, there is a strong need for the development of improved cosmetic compositions and cosmetic methods for the treatment and skin care of diabetes skin. As an alternative to existing products, the present invention further provides a method of providing at least one skin care benefit selected from the group consisting of: treating, delaying or preventing the impairments and pathologies which are characteristic of the diabetes state and improve the appearance and condition of skin. This includes: treating sensitive, dry or flaky skin, to induce skin elasticity and flexibility. Treating<br>
      delaying or preventing sagging of skin; imparting a youthful appearance to skin, normalizing skin color by lightening or darkening skin; soothing irritated or sensitive skin; improving skin texture, enhancing skin smoothness and inducing skin firmness and strength as well as regulating oil/sebum secretion and moisture; Furthermore, these compositions are also indicated for delay, treat or prevent the<br>
       distinct patliologies which can appear in diabetes skin including: necrobiosis<br><br><br>
lipoidica diabeticorum, granuloma annulare, diabetic dermopathy, bullosis diabeticorum, limited joint mobility, scleredema diabeticorum, acanthosis nigricans, acquired perforating dermatosis, insulin allergy or diabetes related cutaneous skin infections.<br>
Many cosmetic compositions and cosmetic methods have been developed for skin care and treatment. However, regarding diabetic skin, a mechanism of action was not described and no specific compositions were found to specifically affect the impairment, associated with the distinct loss of structure and function, characteristic of the diabetes skin. Therefore, no unique products or treatment methods were described to date to treat the cosmetic appearance and the pathologies linked with skin diabetic state.<br>
Overall, in this invention we show that diabetes skin has unique characteristics. We identified the mechanisms underlying the pathology and suggest a line of therapeutically active or cosmetically effective compositions for skin care in order to ameliorate or prevent the deterioration of skin structure in diabetes. Some of these compositions were shown to be effective in correcting unique defects correlated to the aging process as well. Therefore, they can be utilized as a new line of cosmetic care products treating the cosmetic appearance of aging skin. Overall, we show that specific molecules related to the insulin signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, adipocyte secreted molecules and PKC modulating agents can treat, prevent or delay the impairments and pathologies of diabetic and aging skin as demonstrated in the presented examples.<br>
The condition of human skin is affected by different factors such as humidity, ultraviolet rays, cosmetic compositions, aging, diseases, stress and nutrition. Several features are associated with skin aging. This includes loss of resilience and skin thinning which are associated with reduction in the number of cells and blood vessels that furnish the skin. In addition, aged skin is associated with changes in skin esthetics and appearance such as wrinkles and crow's feet, stains and age spots, sagging, loss of tautness and gloss, loss of flexibility and )     elasticity.<br><br><br>
Decline in the fibroblasts and other dermal cells proliferation is associated with loss of collagen biosynthesis and irregularities of various components of the extracellular matrix in the skin thus, leading to loss of elasticity and induction of wrinkles and sagging which is characteristic of the skin aging process. Therefore, a variety of skin related products for cosmetic use in aging skin includes components Icnown to affect dermal structure, dermal cell proliferation and the induction of collagen and matrix production. In the present invention, we have described a new mechanism for the induction of skin aging which is characterized by the loss of the subcutaneous fat tissue and mediates irregularities in the adipocyte tissue components within the skin, including the impairment in the secretion of various adipokines. In order to correct this phenomenon, known agents involved in the differentiation and distribution of adipose tissue were tested accordind to the invention. Our results show that treatment with these agents enhanced adipocyte distribution and hypodermis layer reformation/renewal in the damaged skin. These agents include PKC activators and inhibitors, factors which activate the insulin signaling pathway. In addition, as the subcutaneous fat tissue serves as an endocrine organ, pathologies could be overcome by the treatment of skin with a variety of adipose secreted factors, contributing to adipocyte proliferation and differentiation processes.<br>
The cosmetic compositions and methods described herein result in the prevention, reduction or delay in the formation of wrinkles, the prevention, reduction or delay in loss of skin tone, and the prevention, reduction or delay in the formation of pimples and blackheads. They also moderate skin discolorations such as brown spots, age spots or liver spots, rejuvenate dry, abused, or irritated skin, close or tighten pores, improve skin texture, smoothness or firmness, and create smooth and supple skin with improved elasticity. A general improvement in the appearance, texture and condition, in particular with respect to the radiance, clarity, and general appearance of skin is achieved. The present invention therefore provides a wide range of results that are collectively described as anti-aging &gt;     benefits.<br><br><br>
The invention will now be illustrated by the following non-limiting Examples.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Material and Methods<br>
(i) Materials.<br>
Tissue culture media and serum were purchased from Biological Industries (Beit HaEmek, Israel). Enhanced Chemical Luminescence (ECL) was performed with a kit purchased from BioRad (Israel). Monoclonal anti phosphotyrosine antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY, USA). Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to PKC isoforms were purchased from Santa Cruz (California, USA) and Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Rat mAB to phosphotyrosine was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and rabbit anti phosphoserine was purchased from Zymed (San Francisco, CA). Horseradish peroxidase anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG were obtained from Bio-Rad (Israel). Leupeptin, aprotinin, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), dithiothreitol (DTI), Na orthovanadate and pepstatin were purchased from Sigma Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Insulin (HumulinR, recombinant human insulin) was purchased from Eli Lilly France SA (Fergersheim, France). IGF1 was a gift from Cytolab (Israel). Keratin 1 and 14, and filaggrin antibodies were purchased from Babco-Convance (Richmond, CA).<br>
(ii) Skin damage in-vivo assays for screening compounds which modify skin physiology under normal and diabetic conditions.<br>
In order to identify the specific changes which characterize diabetic skin complications, we studied skin biopsies obtained from mice and Psammomys obesus animal models of diabetes type I and diabetes type II. Different mouse strains were used for the emphasis of specific signaling pathways. A wild type strain (129 brown mouse) - normal and diabetic sub groups. Mice were maintained normoglycemic or were diabetes-induced by a single injection of STZ (185 mg/kg<br><br><br>
in citrate buffer). In addition, we utilized an insulin signaling compromised strain and a defective MAPK signaling - normal and diabetic sub groups. Psammomys obesus were obtained from both diabetic prone and diabetic resistant strains and placed on high energy diet, which is the inducer of diabetes in this animal model. Skin biopsies were either embedded in paraffin or frozen for protein analysis via Western blotting. Assessment of specific parameters was performed by histological analysis using H&amp;E, Elastin and Masson staining and immunohistochemistry specifically indicating epidermal differentiation state. Immunohistochemical markers included specific protein expression of keratins 14 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) characteristic of basal proliferating cells, Keratin 1 (specific of spinous differentiating cells) and filaggrin distribution (characteristic of the cornified layer-terminal differentiation state).<br>
Our model of skin damage is based on late diabetic complications. We utilized a number of mouse models including C57BL/6J, known to spontaneously develop insulin resistance to some extent, together with streptozotocin (STZ) injection for diabetes development. Only mice that persisted to overt diabetes, assessed by the prolonged time with very high levels of hyperglycemia (&gt;450 mg/dl for a period of 7 days or more), were taken into consideration and compared to their non-injected litter mates. Additional animal models included: a mouse with a defected insulin signaling pathway due to PKC8 depletion and a mouse from 129 origin with defective MAPK signaling route in skin due to PKCct depletion in skin. PKC downregulation can be achieved by either treating the skin with long term phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) exposure or the specific modulation of skin cells utilizing PKC isoform inhibitors. These mice were also injected with STZ and maintained in an overt diabetic state. Skin from these models was subjected to both paraffin embedding and histological analysis as well as protein expression analysis by immunoprecipitation and Western blot.<br><br><br>
(lit) In vitro model systems of skin.<br>
The in vitro model systems were based on primary skin cell cultures, either keratinocytes or fibroblasts. The cells were treated and tested for morphological changes as well as migratory and proliferative capacity. Migration was studied utilizing the scratch assay technique and proliferation was tested by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression or by thymidine incorporation, as described byShenefo/. (2001).<br>
(iv) Assessment of scar formation in Large White &amp; Landracepig.<br>
Incisions were performed on the backs of pigs and assessed for scar formation for periods of 20-30 days post-wounding. Biopsies were collected and embedded in paraffin. Assessment was performed by morphological and esthetics analysis.<br>
(v) In vitro methods for the detection of compounds that modulate proliferation, differentiation, migration (detachment, attachment, cell death) of keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts.<br>
Isolation and culture of murine keratinocytes.<br>
Primary keratinocytes were isolated from newborn skin as previously described (Alt et al., 2001). Keratinocytes were cultured in Eagle's Minimal Essential Medium (EMEM) containing 8% Chelex (Chelex-100, BioRad) treated fetal bovine serum. In order to maintain a proliferative basal cell phenotype, the final Ca2+ concentration was adjusted to 0.05 mM. Experiments were performed 5-7 days after plating.<br>
Isolation and culture of murine dermal fibroblasts.<br>
Primary dermal fibroblasts were isolated from newborn skin. For each newborn skin, dermis was separated from epidermis after overnight flotation on trypsin. Dermises were then incubated with collagenase (25 ml per 10 dermises) for 30 min with agitation at 37°C. Next, 3 volumes of HiCa, namely, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) with serum and fungisome, were added to the<br><br><br>
filtrate and suspension was filtered through sterile nylon mesh and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 7 min at RT (pellet contains fibroblasts and follicles). Pellet was re-suspended in HiCa, each mouse equivalent to 1 ml medium and centrifuged at 500 rpm for 3 min (pellet contains follicles; supernatant contains fibroblasts). Appropriate volumes of HiCa were added to the supernatant and plated in equivalent 1 mouse per 10 cm culture dish. The experiments were performed on early cell passages (passages 2-6).<br>
Screening for active compounds that affect physiological processes of skin.<br>
Once cells reached sub-confluency, their morphology was photodocumented (time zero) and treatment with different potential cosmeceutical agents was performed. The evaluation of the results was performed at appropriate time points: immediate molecular response 5 sec-15 min (for activation of molecular pathways) and late morphological/physiological response were assessed at 24-72 hours post-treatment. Morphological changes that are associated with maintenance of skin architecture (attachment/detachment, proliferation, differentiation, cell death) were followed and photodocumented. In addition, cell lysates were subjected to biochemical/molecular analysis using an appropriate method including immunoblotting with stage specific marker antibodies.<br>
Preparation of cell extracts and Western blot analysis.<br>
For crude membrane fractions, whole cell lysates were prepared by scraping cells into PBS containing 10 ug/ml aprotinin, 10 ug/ml leupeptin, 2 ug/ml pepstatin, 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 200 uM NaV04 and 10 mM NaF. After homogenization and 4 freeze/thaw cycles, lysates were spun down at 4°C for 20 min in a microcentrifuge at maximal speed. The supernatant containing the soluble cytosol protein fraction was transferred to another tube. The pellet was resuspended in 250 ul PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 with protease and phosphatase inhibitors, incubated for 30 min at 4°C and spun down in a microcentrifuge at maximal speed at 4°C. The supernatant contains the membrane fraction. Protein concentrations were measured using a modified Lowery<br><br><br>
assay (Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay Kit). Western blot analysis of cellular protein fractions was carried out as described (Alt et al., 2001).<br>
Preparation of cell lysatesfor invnimoprecipitation.<br>
Culture dishes containing keratinocytes were washed with Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS. Cells were mechanically detached in radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer<br>
(50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4; 150 mMNaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 10 mMNaF; 1% Triton X-100; 0.1% SDS, 1% Sodium deoxycholate) containing a cocktail of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (20 ug/ml leupeptin; 10 ug/ml aprotinm; 0.1 mM PMSF; 1 mM DTT; 200 uM Na orthovanadate; 2 ug/ml pepstatin). The preparation was centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at maximal speed for 20 min at 4°C. The supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation.<br>
Immunoprecipitation.<br>
The lysate was precleared by mixing 300 ug of cell lysate with 25 ul of Protein A/G Sepharose (Santa Cruz, CA, USA), and the suspension was rotated continuously for 30 min at 4°C. The preparation was then centrifuged at maximal speed at 4°C for 10 min, and 30 jo.1 of A/G Sepharose was added to the supernatant along with specific polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies to the individual antigens (dilution 1:100). The samples were rotated overnight at 4°C. The suspension was then centrifuged at maximal speed for 10 min at 4°C, and the pellet was washed with RPA buffer. The suspension was again centrifuged at 15,000 x g (4°C for 10 min) and washed 4 times in Tris-Buffered Saline Tween-20 (TBST). Sample buffer<br>
(0.5 M Tris-HCl pH 6.8; 10% SDS; 10% glycerol; 4% 2-beta-mercaptoethanol; 0.05% bromophenol blue) was added and the samples were boiled for 5 min and then subjected to SDS-PAGE.<br>
Example 1. Diabetes skin exhibits excessive inflammatory response<br>
One of the serious problems in skin that result from diabetes is the tendency of an abnormal upregulated inflammatory response. These hyperinflamed areas are<br><br><br>
future local 'hot spots' for skin susceptibility for diabetic lesions and further damage.<br>
Skin biopsies of diabetic (STZ injected) as well as non-diabetic C57BL/6J mice were dissected and embedded in paraffin, and histological sections were performed and analyzed by H&amp;E histological staining. Inflammation was graded by abscess formation and excessive leukocytosis in the skin and proximal blood vessels. Fig. 1A-1D show the inflammation response in skin of diabetic animals (1A-1B), in which abscess formation is marked by yellow arrows, vs. non-diabetic animals (1C-1D). As shown, skin of diabetic animals is indeed prone to severe inflammation response, indicated by facilitated abscess formation in different parts of the skin. Therefore, it is important to prevent this manifestation in order to overcome the diabetic inflamed skin problem.<br>
In addition to the enhanced abnormal inflammatory response, the integrity of diabetic skin structure is severally compromised. This severe impairment includes the abrogation of the hypodermis subcutaneous adipose tissue, the hyper differentiation and abnormal structure of the epidermis, and the disruption of dermal structure.<br>
Example 2. Skin architecture is altered in diabetes and aged animals<br>
Skin biopsies from normoglycemic as well as diabetic (STZ injected) C57BL/6J mice were paraffin embedded and analyzed by H&amp;E histological staining.<br>
As shown in Figs. 2A-2D, diabetes has a profound effect on skin architecture. Fig. 2A shows the structure of normoglycemic mouse skin in which the hypodermis fat layer, indicated by an arrow, underlies the dermis. Contrary to that, diabetic mouse skin exhibits an absolute absence of hypodermis fat tissue, and instead, the underlying muscle is "pushed" under the dermis rendering the appearance of thinner skin (Fig. 2B). The same phenomena was observed in all the other diabetic models we have tested, including the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, Psammomys obesus type 2 diabetic model, diabetic rats and also in large animal models. The restoration of the subcutaneous adipose tissue may overcome the<br><br><br>
diabetic skin pathologies. The epidermis is also compromised by the diabetic state. Figs. 2C shows the structure of normal mouse skin, demonstrating normal structure of the epidermis underlined by a yellow speckled line. Fig. 2D shows diabetic mouse skin demonstrating abnormal structure of the epidermis underlined by a yellow speckled line. As can be seen, the diabetic epidermis is thin, exhibits fewer layers and portrays a disruption in differentiation pattern demonstrated by an increased cornified envelope formation.<br>
Skin biopsies from normal 129 brown mice as well as from impaired insulin signaling 129 brown mice, in which PKC5 deficiency was induced, were paraffin embedded and analyzed by H&amp;E histological staining. Figs. 3A-3B illustrate the direct effect of the insulin pathway on skin structure as demonstrated in the insulin resistant skin model (3B), exhibiting a defective dermal structure compared to the normal skin (3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, the dermis in the insulin resistant skin model appears to be markedly reduced as well as having a disorganized structure. The disorganized structure of the dermis is visible in whole animal observations as well: mice seem fragile with very thin skin. These pathologies resemble human diabetic pathologies such as diabetic dermopathy.<br>
From the data presented above it is clear that diabetes affects all skin layers in a distinct manner. In addition, through utilization of the specific signaling models it is further understood that when the insulin signaling pathway is disrupted, the dermal layer is directly compromised. Thus, by modulating downstream elements of the insulin signaling pathway in skin such as PI3K, PDK1, MAPK, Ras, PKC, Akt and their adaptor molecules and transcription factors, we will be able to regulate architectural properties of skin. In addition, this data shows that the presence of the adipose layer is crucial for skin physiology. The importance of adipose tissue is further corroborated by the ability of fat cells to serve as a source of various secreted factors and as an endocrine organ (i.e. adipokine secretion), affecting other skin layers. Another aspect of diabetes induced architectural impairment is demonstrated by the epidermal differentiation scheme: by influencing the regulation of specific signaling pathways involved, such as insulin and MAPK, we can restore<br><br><br>
the normal differentiation pattern which is a common base for diabetic related dermopathies.<br>
Eight weeks old and eight month old C57BL/6J mice (n=10 in each group) were sacrificed and skin biopsies were embedded in paraffin and analyzed by H&amp;E histological staining for intact hypodermis layer. Pig. 4 shows the percent of mice with normal hypodermis in each group. As can be seen, old mice also exhibit depletion of the subcutaneous hypodermal layer, indicating that, as in diabetes, restoration of this layer will overcome the pathologies which result from its depletion.<br>
Example 3. Skin strength in diabetic animal<br>
Diabetic skin has been described as frail and thin. Many of the pathologies related to the diabetic state have shown histological evidence of changes in matrix structure and physiology. We conducted a series of experiments following this basis and subjected skin biopsies to strength testing by bursting pressure. For this analysis, dissected skin was placed in a bursting chamber and increasing flow of CO2 was inflicted on the skin. After the breaking point in which the skin was ruptured, the data was analyzed and summarized in graphic form.<br>
       Skin biopsies from diabetic (STZ injected) as well as non-diabetic C57BL/6J<br>
mice (n=10 in each group) were dissected and subjected to bursting pressure<br>
        analysis, as described hereinabove. The bursting pressure  (kg/cm2) of each<br>
     dissection is shown in Table 2 hereinbelow and the average bursting pressure of<br>
each group is shown in Fig. 5.<br>
Table 2: Skin strength of diabetic (STZ injected) vs. non-diabetic mice<br><br>
Treatment	Skin Strength (kg/cm2)<br>
Non-Diabetic Mice	0.85,1.10,1.25,1.26,1.28,1.30,1.40,1.50,1.52,1.7<br>
Diabetic Mice	0.10,0.20,0.25, 0.48, 0.55,0.62, 0.64,0.75, 0.82, 0.92,1.2<br>
 	As clearly shown in Fig. 5 and Table 2, skin strength is reduced by half in<br>
diabetic animals, further exemplifying the diabetic influence on skin structure. It is<br><br><br>
understood that skin strength is based on its collagen and other matrix fibers content and organization. Furthermore, as shown in Example 2 hereinabove, diabetic skin hypodermis layer is reduced promoting skin thinning and loss of skin strength. The restoration of skin strength can be achieved by influencing collagen and matrix fibers formation in the dermis, induction of hypodermis adipose tissue formation and distribution, as well as maintenance of adequate epidermal organization (proliferation and differentiation patterns).<br>
Example 4. Skin elasticity and diabetes<br>
Skin biopsies from diabetic (STZ injected) C57BL/6J mice were paraffin embedded and analyzed by elastin staining using the Verhoeff-Van Gieson procedure for elastic fibers, described by Fan andNagle (2002).<br>
Figs 6A-6C show the elastin distribution in the various skin biopsies illustrated as thin black fibers outlined by yellow arrows; Fig. 6A shows the elastin distribution in diabetic mouse skin, Fig 6B shows diabetic mouse skin following manipulation by induction of MAPK pathway, exhibiting restoration of elastic fibers, and Fig. 6C shows diabetic mouse skin in which insulin signaling was impaired by inhibition of PKC8 activation, exhibiting a similar pattern of proliferation as the diabetic control (6A).<br>
In addition to the disrupted skin architecture and reduced skin strength, diabetic skin has been shown to be more fragile due to loss of elastic filaments. The data presented hereinabove clearly demonstrate that diabetic skin has reduced elastin fiber distribution in the dermis, and through the signaling specific models we better understand this phenomenon. In the insulin signaling defective skin model shown in Fig. 6C, elastin fibers seem to be decreased under diabetic condition as compared to wild type normoglycemic controls (not shown), indicating that insulin signaling has a direct influence on elastin content. On the other hand, the MAPK regulated pathway model, shown in Fig. 6B, restores elastin content to normoglycemic levels (not shown), indicating that by overriding the insulin non-responsive pathway by activating downstream elements in various ways we can t    treat diabetes related skin impairments.<br><br><br>
Example 5. Diabetes influences proliferation capacity of skin<br>
Skin biopsies from normoglycemic as well as diabetic (STZ injected) C57BL/6J mice were paraffin embedded and analyzed by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunohistochemical staining.<br>
Figs 7A-7C show the proliferation capacity of the various skin biopsies illustrated as dark brown stained nuclei: Fig. 7A shows the proliferation capacity of normoglycemic mouse skin illustrated as dark brown stained nuclei outlined by yellow arrows; Fig. 7B shows diabetic mouse skin exhibiting marked reduction in the skin proliferating capacity (less brown staining) both in dermis and epidermis; and Fig. 7C shows diabetic mouse skin in which MAPK and PKCa pathways were inhibited, exhibiting restoration of normal proliferation capacity outlined by yellow arrows.<br>
It is well documented that the proliferation capacity in diabetic skin is compromised underlying many related pathologies such as acanthosis nigricans, acquired perforating dermatosis (APD) and other dermopathies. The data presented hereinabove illustrates that diabetes down regulates proliferation in the epidermis as well as in the dermis. Through the manipulation of specific signaling pathways, including insulin down stream signaling such as MAPK and PKCa mediated pathways, we can restore the proliferation pattern both in the normal and diabetic animals (Fig. 7C). These results imply that by inhibiting specific elements of the MAPK pathway and specific regulation of insulin downstream signaling we can overcome the defects associated with signaling related skin pathologies involving epidermis and/or dermis and /or hypodermis proliferation and differentiation.<br>
In order to prevent and treat the impairments and pathologies of diabetic skin, specific molecules related to the insulin signaling pathway or the MAPK signaling pathway, adipocyte secreted molecules, PKC modulating agents and other related molecules can be used, as demonstrated in the following examples.<br><br><br>
Example 6. Attenuation of the diabetic skin inflammatory response<br>
Damaged skin of diabetic (STZ injected) C57BL/6J mice was treated with either PBS (control) or adiponectin (0.1 ug/ml) for 7 days (total n=18). Thereafter, skin biopsies were collected, embedded in paraffin, and analyzed for inflammation by H&amp;E histological staining. Inflammation was graded by abscess formation and excessive leukocytosis in the skin and proximal blood vessels, and severe inflammation was considered when both abscess and leukocytosis were apparent. Fig. 8 shows the percent of total animals per group with severe inflammation.<br>
In the next step, damaged skin from diabetic (STZ injected) C57BL/6J mice was treated with either PBS (control); a mixture of insulin (0.1 unit) and the N-myristoylated PKCa pseudosubstrate peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 (luM); or Copolymer-1 (Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Israel), (55 ug/ml) for 9 days (n=6 per each group). As previously discovered in the laboratories of the present inventors, Cop-1 was found to be a specific and very effective PKCri inhibitor. Thereafter, skin biopsies were collected, embedded in paraffin, and analyzed for inflammation by H&amp;E histological staining. Inflammation was graded as described above. Fig. 9 shows the percent of total animals per group with severe inflammation.<br>
Fig. 8 shows that the hyperinflammation phenomenon in diabetic skin can be prevented by introducing adipokines such as adiponectin. In particular, adiponectin at 0.1 ug/ml dramatically reduced the inflammation response in skin where only 20% of the animals exhibited severe inflammation of the skin in comparison to 90% in the non-treated control group. Similar results were obtained when different adiponectin concentrations (0.01-1 ug/ml) were tested (not shown).<br>
Fig. 9 shows that the hyperinflammation can be reduced when treating with either specific peptides such as PKCTJ inhibitors or peptide combinations such as the combination of a PKCa inhibitor and insulin which is a PKC8 activator. In particular, a markedly reduced inflammation was achieved when treating with either Cop-1 or the combination of insulin and the N-myristoylated PKCa pseudosubstrate i     peptide of SEQ ED NO: 1.<br><br><br>
Example 7. Agents increasing skin strength in diabetic mice<br>
Skin biopsies from 129 wild type mice and from 129 where PKCa or PKC£ activation was depleted, were dissected and subjected to bursting pressure analysis, as described in Example 3 hereinabove. The average bursting pressure (kg/cm2) per group is shown in Fig. 10.<br>
As can be seen, specific modulation of signaling pathways known to influence matrix and collagen formation, adipose tissue differentiation and epidermal integrity in skin can improve skin strength. Skin strength in diabetic animals is impaired, as a result of impaired skin regeneration of the various skin layers affecting related physiological processes. These results point out potential treatments overcoming diabetic related impairments.<br>
Example 8. Reconstruction of the hypodermis layer in damaged skin<br>
Damaged skin from diabetic (STZ injected) C57BL/6J mice was treated with either PBS (control); a mixture of insulin (0.1 unit) and the N-myristoylated PKCa pseudosubstrate peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 (luM); or adipsin (1 uM) for 7-9 days. Skin biopsies were then collected and embedded in paraffin, and histological sections were performed and stained with H&amp;E. The sections were analyzed for presence of the hypodermis layer presented as a continuous layer of adipocytes, and the percent of total animals per each group with fully reconstituted hypodermis is shown in Figs. 11A-11B.<br>
The results presented hereinabove clearly demonstrate that the combination of a PKCa inhibitor such as the N-myristoylated PKCa pseudosubstrate peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 and a PKC8 activator such as insulin, as well as adipokines such as adipsin, can reconstruct the hypodermal subcutaneous layer in diabetic animal and prevent some of the severe diabetic skin impairments.<br>

Primary mouse keratinocytes were cultured in 0.05 mM Ca+2 MEM and differentiation  was  induced  by  elevating  Ca+2  concentrations  to  0.12  mM.<br><br><br>
Keratinocytes were treated with either PBS (control) or different concentrations (50, 150 and 300 nM) of troglitazone, a PPARy activator. The ceils were lysed and the cytoskeletal fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGB and blotted with anti-filaggrin antibody.<br>
PPARy is an insulin regulated transcription factor mainly secreted by adipocytes, and a crucial regulator of diabetes progression. PPARy can affect keratinocytes underlined by subcutaneous adipose tissue. As clearly shown in the Western blot analysis, activation of PPARy can induce the pattern and structure of normal skin by upregulation of filaggrin expression which signifies induction of terminal differentiation and comified layer formation (Fig. 12).<br>
In the next step, 5-day old primary mouse keratinocytes were untreated or treated for 20 min with different concentrations (50, 100 and 200 nM) of rosiglitazone, another PPARy agonist known as an anti-diabetic drug.. The cells were then washed with PBS (x2) and culture medium was added. Eighteen hours after treatment, the cells were subjected to proliferation analysis by thymidine incorporation, as described in Materials and Methods hereinabove. Fig. 13 shows the effect of rosiglitazone on keratinocyte proliferation capacity. The results show the profound increase in keratinocyte proliferation by rosiglitazone, further acknowledging the role of adipocyte secreted factors on skin physiology.<br>
Keratin 1 (Kl) belongs to a large family of cytoskeletal proteins whose expression in skin keratinocytes varies depending on commitment of the cell to differentiate into spinous epidermal layer. Reduced Kl expression leads to skin hyperplasia, callus formation and disruption of skin barrier functions.<br>
Cytoskeletal fractions of whole skin total lysates from various experimental mice were subjected to Western blot analysis utilizing anti-Kl antibody. As shown in Fig. 14, skin from diabetic mice exhibits reduced Kl expression, supporting earlier observations of diabetes-related skin complications. Diabetic animals with depleted PKCa levels demonstrates high levels of epidermal Kl, similarly to those observed in control non-diabetic animals. In contrast, PKC8 depletion causes reduction of Kl expression in skin of non-diabetic animals. The data presented<br><br><br>
above indicate that prevention of Kl decrease in skin by PKCa inhibition or by upregulation of PKC8 activity, together with pharmacological maintenance of Kl expression, may minimize diabetes-related damages in skin.<br>
Example 10. The combination of insulin and a PKCa inhibitor prevents scar formation and improves esthetics of a damaged skin //; vivo<br>
Surgical longitudinal incisions were performed on the backs of Large White &amp; Landrace 4 month old 60 kg female pigs (n=8). After wound closure, the scar sites were treated with either PBS (control) or with the combination of insulin (0.1 unit) and the N-myristoylated PKCa pseudosubstrate peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 (luM) for 21 days. Thereafter, the scar sites were photographed for the assessment of esthetics and scar formation. Fig. 15 shows the 4 scar sites treated with PBS (upper panel) and the 4 scar sites treated with the combination described above (lower panel).<br>
In a different experiment, scarred horse skin was treated topically for 14 days with the combination described hereinabove, in order to improve the esthetics of the skin. Fig. 16 shows the treated area on days 0 (16A) and 14 (16B).<br>
As clearly shown in both Figs. 15 and 16, the treatment with the combination of insulin and the N-myristoylated PKCa pseudosubstrate peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1, affecting the insulin-MAPK signaling pathway, can prevent scar formation and improve the overall esthetics of a damaged skin. Furthermore, in large animals including horses and dogs, treatment also induced the growth and development of new hair in replacement of scar tissue implying the ability of treatment to induce hair growth, which further improves skin aesthetics, indicating that the same effect may also be achieved by other small molecules affecting the insulin-MAPK 
Example 11. Mediators of the insulin signaling pathway can be modulated to prevent and/or overcome diabetes skin pathologies<br>
Phosphotidylinositol-3-Kinase (PI3K) is known as one of the keystones of insulin signaling. It functions upstream of Akt and delivers the signal from insulin<br><br><br>
receptor via phosphotidylinositol-3-phosphates. Fig. 17 shows the analysis of Triton-soluble fractions of whole skin total lysates from (i) a control non-diabetic; (ii) a control diabetic; (iii) a PKCa depleted diabetic; and (iv) a PKC8 depleted non-diabetic 129 brown mice, subjected to Western blot analysis utilizing anti-PI3K antibody. As shown, a drastic elevation in PI3K expression levels in skin of diabetic mice is observed, probably due to compensatory mechanism of the skin. PKCa depletion in diabetic animals normalized PI3K expression and brought its levels to those of control non-diabetic mice. This was associated with restoration of normal histological features in skin as observed by histology slides. Moreover, mice lacking PKC8, even at the non-diabetic state, demonstrated extremely high levels of PI3K, higher than those observed in control diabetic animals, predisposing the experimental animals to diabetes complications. These skins were also depleted of adipose tissue and demonstrated thinning of skin (not shown). Thus, inhibition of PI3K expression by pharmacological agents together with PKCa activity downregulation may benefit diabetes-related complications in skin.<br>
As a result of insulin induced signaling, key enzyme Akt becomes activated and initiates various cellular responses that include differentiation, migration and survival. Akt represents one of the hallmarks of PI3K-mediated insulin signaling. Its regulation by altering its cellular expression may contribute to insulin sensitivity of the cell. Fig. 18A shows the analysis of Triton-soluble fractions of whole skin total lysates from (i) a control non-diabetic; (ii) a control diabetic; (iii) a PKCa depleted non-diabetic; and (iv) a PKCa depleted diabetic 129 brown mice, subjected to Western blot analysis utilizing anti-Akt antibody. As can be seen, expression level of Akt significantly increases in skin of diabetic mice as compared to non-diabetic animals. This may be attributed to the loss of this enzyme activation due to lack of insulin in diabetic animals and accumulation of unused Akt potential as a compensation mechanism by the cell. PKCa deficient non-diabetic mice exhibit Akt levels similar to control; however, induction of diabetes in these animals eventually elevates Akt expression levels, though by significantly lower intensity. •     As shown in Fig. 18B, this can be explained by basal elevation of Akt activity in<br><br><br>
PKCa deficient animals, which in turn downregulates Akt expression by inducing Akt inhibiting proteins.<br>
The data presented hereinabove indicate that inhibition of PKCa minimizes the diabetes-related effect on Akt expression levels in skin. Taken together with pharmacological prevention of Akt accumulation, PKCa inhibition will contribute to normalization of Alct levels in skin cells of diabetic patients.<br>
Similarly to Akt, another signaling component of insulin-induced pathways, MAPK, is activated in response to insulin. Fig. 19 shows the analysis of Triton-soluble fractions of whole skin total lysates from (i) a control non-diabetic; (ii) a control diabetic; (hi) a PKCa depleted non-diabetic; (iv) a PKCa depleted diabetic; (v) a PKC8 depleted non-diabetic; and (vi) a PKC8 depleted 129 brown diabetic mice, subjected to Western Blot analysis utilizing anti-pMAPK and anti-MAPK antibodies.<br>
As shown in Fig. 19, induction of diabetes elevates both MAPK activation and cellular expression levels. In PKCa deficient animals, activation and expression of MAPK show only a minor increase. Thus, inhibition of PKCa prevents MAPK accumulation and activation and therefore balancing MAPK distribution in diabetes patients. On the other hand, PKC8 deficient mice show relatively high levels of MAPK activation and expression even at non-diabetic conditions, thus predisposing the animal to diabetes development. The data presented hereinabove indicate that by inhibiting PKCa and activation of PKC8, together with pharmacological inhibition of MAPK activation and/or expression, one may overcome diabetes symptoms in skin.<br>
Example 12. The combination of insulin with a PKCa inhibitor promotes complete recovery of diabetes related skin disorders<br>
A patient with diabetes related skin disorder was treated topically with a combination of insulin (0.1 unit) and the N-myristoylated PKCa pseudosubstrate peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 (mM). Figs. 20A-20B show the palm of the hand of this patient on days 0 (20A) and 14 (20B).<br><br><br>
Another aging patient (80 years old) with diabetes dermopathy was treated as described hereinabove. Figs. 21A-21B show the back of the hand of this patient on days 0 (21A) and 14 (21B).<br>
In the third case, diabetic lesions of a patient were treated for 14 days as described above. Fig. 22A-22B show the treated area on days 0 (22A) and 14 (22B).<br>
The results presented hereinabove indicate that in all these cases, a two weeks treatment with the aforesaid combination promoted complete recovery of the skin.<br><br><br>
