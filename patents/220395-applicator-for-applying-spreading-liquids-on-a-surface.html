PRIOR ART :<br>
This Invention In general relates to liquid dispensers and In particular to an applicator for applying liquids on a surface. Mora specifically the applicator of this invention is meant for use with a bottle and for applying the liquid from the bottle on to a surface.<br>
Applicator liquid dispensing devices have numerous advantageous for applying liquid on a surface and with the help of the applicator the liquid can be easily applied on a confined area of a surface without becoming messy and splashing ail over. The liquid in this case may be gums, paints, polish** which are contained in bottles or containers. However, It has been found that the applicator of the present Invention Is particularly useful for use with bottles containing shoe care products Including shoe polish and with the help of tine applicator polishing cream can be conveniently applied on a shoe at all Its nook and corners.<br>
This application Is for an applicator for applying and spreading liquids on a surface. This applicator may be used In conjunction with a container which would normally hold the liquid to be applied. This applicator also can be a part of the cap device so that it also serves the purpose of closing the container holding the liquid. However, the invention also pertains to the stem which holds the applicator sponge and the associated locking disc.<br><br>
Tha applicator Is a device which facilitates easy application of liquid with minimum effort and without messing up the hands or the surrounding area during application process and liquids In this case can be products which requires to be picked up from a container applied and spread over the surface. Examples Gum, paints, polishes, cosmetic lotions etc.<br>
There are different types of applicators currently In use. Soma of the common applicator devices are a brush at the end of the stem. The sponge or any other material capable of absorption of liquid is fixed to a circular slot at the end of the stem and similar absorbable material fixed at the end of the stem using a 'C clamp like arrangement. These applicator mechanisms mentioned above may be used as such or the stem may be fixed to a cap which forms the closure of the bottle holding the liquid and the stem goes into tha liquid when the container is kept closed with the cap. On opening the cap and removal of the stem from the container the absorbed liquid at the end of the stem would then be spread on the surface.<br>
Another known construction of an applicator which Is capable of being used with a bottle or container comprises a cap member having a stem at whose end 1$ provided a circular hole through which Is held a piece of cotton, fabric, sponge or the like but such a known construction Is associated with the disadvantage that Is splashed the liquid during application because of the free ends of the piece of cotton, fabric or sponge held through the hole provided at the end of the applicator.<br><br>
In our Invention we have Improved upon all available construction known prior at this. Our invention also gives fult-proofness to this mechanism and renders an asethlcaliy much better device than any known devices available.<br>
QUESTS OF THE INVENTION :<br>
It Is therefore, an object of this invention to provide an improved construction of an applicator which obviates the disadvantages associated with the known construction of applicators.<br>
Another object of this Invention is to purpose an improved construction of an applicator which Is easy to manufacture, cheap in costs and efficient in its use.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION Of THE INVENTION :<br>
An applicator for applying liquids on a surface from a bottle or container comprises a stem with a cap member, the said stem being made of any material contains a mechanism for fixing the absorption material capable of spreading the liquid under use. The mechanism consists of a circular disc being slipped through the tip of the stem having conical tip, the disc travel behind the conical tip and gets locked tn the step and becomes Irreversibly locked Into the stem, the first disc Is positioned at the top end of the stem. A perfectly cylindrical die cut sponge with no loose end is then through the stem and locked in place with<br><br>
the use of a second disc so that the splashing of the liquid during application is totally eliminated, the cylindrical surface being smooth and even. A perfectly cylindrical die cut sponge with no loose ends totally eliminates splashing of the liquid during application as the said absorption device sponge is positioned at the end of the stem end being arrested held between the two discs.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVEimOM WITH REFERENCE TO DRAWINGS :<br>
Now the invention will be described in detail with reference to tha drawings accompanying tine specification wherein:<br>
Figure A shows the elevation of our fully assembled applicator with the cap device on the top.<br>
Figure B shows the details of the applicator stem without the absorption material eg. sponge etc.<br>
Figure C shows the circular discs which is Inserted into the stem through the specially designed irreversible V notch tip of the stem. One each above the absorbing media, one be low the absorbing media,<br>
Figure D shows the cross section of the die cut sponge with e central hole through which the stem passes.<br><br>
Figure E shows the aerial view of the die cut sponge with the central hole.<br>
The applicator as per the invention comprises of a stem at the end of which is affixed e round die cut sponge which is held in position by two circular discs which are Inserted Inside the stem one above the sponge and one below the sponge In an Irreversible fashion so that the sponge will not come out and this becomes a fool proof device compared to the other applicator devices known. In the other applicator devices already known In the art sponge or other absorption material at the end of the sponge Is inserted into a circular slot or C type hook in which case there is every chance of the sponge coming out during application or If gentle pressure Is given from one side, Even In the case of other known device which has a brush attached to one end of the stem It Is a common knowledge that there bristles in the brush do come out during application and spoil the finish of the applied surface.<br>
Both in the case of the brush at the end of the stem and sponge fixed to the C type hook at the end of the stem there are loose free ends which cause splashing of the liquid during application and also does not spread the liquid In an even fashion leaving streak of patches on the applied surface. The device Invented by us totally eliminates these problem as it is a perfectly cylindrical die out sponge with no loose ends there by totally avoiding splashing of the liquid<br><br>
during application. The surface being smooth and circular the application of iiquid it very even on the surface surface and gives a perfect even finish on the applied surface.<br>
The die cut sponge or any material which can absorb liquid fixed at the end of the stem Is our device has a very precise geometrical finish compared to the other known devices like the brush at the end of the stem or a clamp holding the absorption material which has a irregular non-geometrical appearance. This makes our device esthetlcally more superior to any of the devices currently known.<br>
The applicator is normally made of an injection molded stem with a cap member or which can also be made of other materials having similar construction. The stem has reducing diameter from the top end to the point 'X' marked in the diagram.<br>
A circular disc as shown In Pig 'C is slipped through the tip of the stem having a conical tip. The circular disc Is designed to be slightly elastic In nature and hence on use of pressure this would slip over the conical tip at the end of tha stem. Once the disc travels behind the conical tip It gets locked In the step and is Irreversibly locked Into the stem. This disc Is positioned at the top end of the stem and die cut cylindrical sponge with a central hole is slipped through the tip of the stem.  The sponge being elastic In nature easily slips over the V notch<br><br>
and goes into the stam. However, the disc at the top end of the step arrests the forward movement of the sponge at a particular position where the top undercut Is provided, The second disc fs slipped In a similar manner as the first disc which positions itself at the undercut step provided immediately after V shaped conical notch, Now the applicator device is fully set of use. The absorption device is positioned conveniently at the end of the stem and Is arrested by the two discs provided from upward or downward movements on the step, In our device we will be using die cut sponge, However, this invention would cover ait applications which provides a stem made out of any material, a locking mechanism for the absorption material which may be a sponge or any other material capable of absorbing the liquid under use and further provide with an Irreversible locking mechanism as described herein.<br>
The construction and components of an applicator device as per the invention for applying liquids on a surface will be described In detail as below :<br>
An applicator for applying liquids on a surface from a bottie or container comprising a cap member, e stem descending centrally from end/or the inside of the said cap member, a sponge to be fitted on the said stem, a locking mechanism to lock the said sponge in position on said stem, the stam having a reducing diameter from the cap member and terminating as a conical tip, a first undercut step and a second undercut step, the second undercut step being provided next to conical tip, the first undercut step away from the said second undercut step at a distance equivalent to length of said sponge.<br><br>
tha locking mechanism comprising of a first circular disc and a second circular disc, inserted onto said stem through tha said conical tip of tha stem and locked Irreversibly at said first undercut step and said second undercut step respectively, the said first circular disc inserted on said stem before inserting of said sponge on said stem, the said second circular disc inserted after inserting the said sponge on said stem, such that the said sponge Is held In position and locked between the said first circular disc and satd second circular disc.<br>
