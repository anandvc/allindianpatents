				<td>DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT METHOD AND DIGITAL RIGHTS<br>
MANAGEMENT-ENABLED MOBILE DEVICE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to a digital rights management (DRM). More<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to a DRM method and DRM-enabled mobile<br>
device.<br>
Description of the Related Art:<br>
[0002]	Mobile commerce (M-commerce) is becoming increasingly important as the<br>
number of mobile users grows rapidly worldwide, and the mobile networks and services<br>
expand to countrywide and worldwide coverage. M-commerce is simply a way to conduct<br>
electronic commerce using mobile devices. M-commerce usually involves multiple<br>
independent business entities as instant mobile operators, service providers, enabling<br>
technology providers, and mobile users. Coordination and interoperability has become a<br>
great concern in such a business setting. Moreover, the success of M-commerce is also<br>
dependent upon the mutual trust among these entities. For example, when intellectual<br>
property is a concern of a business, privacy and trust become requirements of the business.<br>
Furthermore, other business components, such as payment and security also play important<br>
roles in M-commerce.<br>
[0003]	Media distribution services, including video conferencing, video-on-demand,<br>
and online music distribution are major mobile businesses. Digital Rights Management<br>
(DRM) is required in media distribution services to protect the intellectual property of the<br>
distributed digital media. DRM technology includes rights insertion, rights enforcement,<br>
license management, license (or media) sharing and the like. Rights insertion and rights<br>
enforcement are responsible for basic DRM operations. License management is to manage<br>
the usage and access rights of purchased media. License (or media) sharing that involves<br>
processes of transferring rights and issuing authorization is a demanding feature in media<br>
distribution services. Payment is highly related to DRM operations, as usage and access<br>
rights are mainly due to the purchasing agreements and terms.<br><br>
[0004]	Rights-protected contents can be copied from a personal computer or<br>
exchanged between mobile devices using infrared technology based on Infrared Data<br>
Association (IrDA) or Bluetooth technology, or using an external memory and hard disk.<br>
Even though the rights-protected contents are copied from another device and media, the user<br>
should obtain a license to play the contents.<br>
[0005]	However, the conventional DRM method does not give an unlicensed user a<br>
chance to pre-experience a copied content, even though the unlicensed user may be an<br>
expected buyer.<br>
[0006]	The conventional DRM method also has a shortcoming in that an unlicensed<br>
user should buy a multimedia content without being able to verify whether the multimedia<br>
content is content that is expected, resulting in a risk of unwanted payment, and leading to a<br>
negative experience of the right protected contents.<br>
[0007]	Accordingly, there is a need for an improved digital rights management<br>
method and digital rights management-enabled mobile device that allows verification of<br>
multimedia content.<br>

the display unit 117 can operate as an input means.<br>
[0034]	The contents processing unit 119 is responsible for operations related to<br>
playback of the contents (media files) according to a user's request. The contents processing<br>
unit 119 determines whether the media file requested to be played is a rights-protected media<br>
file. In the case of a rights-protected media file, the contents processing unit 119 extracts<br>
information on a sample playback part of the rights-protected media file and then plays back<br>
the sample playback part. That is, the contents processing unit 119 processes the rights-<br>
protected media file to be played using only the sample playback part when a playback<br>
attempt is performed by an unlicensed user.<br>
[0035]	The header of the rights-protected media file is specified as in Tables 1 and 2.<br>
[0036]	The control unit 101 controls the signal exchanges between the elements<br>
constituting the mobile device. The data processing unit 105 and the contents processing unit<br>
119 can be incorporated into the control unit 101.<br>
[0037]	The control unit 101 also controls interoperability and coordination among the<br>
data processing unit 105, the keypad unit 109, the memory unit 111, the camera unit 113, the<br>
video processing unit 115, and the contents processing unit 119.<br><br>
[0038]	The control unit 101 determines whether a playback attempt to the rights-<br>
protected media file is performed by a licensed user and replays the rights-protected media<br>
file at using only the sample playback part, if the playback attempt is performed by an<br>
unlicensed user.<br>
[0039]	FIG. 2 is a flowchart illustrating a DRM method according to an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0040]	Referring to FIG. 2, while in a waiting state (S201), the DRM-enabled mobile<br>
device determines whether a playback request is input for a media file (S203).<br>
[0041]	If a playback request is input, the DRM-enabled mobile device analyzes the<br>
playback requested media file (S205) and determines whether the playback requested media<br>
file is a rights-protected media file (S207). The rights-protected media file can be<br>
distinguished by a media file format shown in Table 1.<br>
[0042]<br><br>
[0043]	As shown in Table 1, the rights-protected media file format includes a file<br>
header and a data region. The file header preferably includes a version field, a<br>
ContentURILen field, a ContentTypeLen field, ContentURI field, a ContentType field, a<br>
HeadersLen field, a DataLen field, and a headers field. If the playback requested media file<br>
has a file format of Table 1, the DRM-enabled mobile device determines that the playback<br>
requested media file is a rights-protected media file.<br>
[0044]	If the playback requested media file is not a rights-protected media file, the<br>
DRM-enabled mobile device starts playback of the whole length of the media file (S209).<br><br>
[0045]	If it is determined that the playback requested media file is a rights-protected<br>
media file, the DRM-enabled mobile device obtains a sample playback part of the rights-<br>
protected media file (S211) and starts replaying the sample playback part of the rights-<br>
protected media file (S213).<br>
[0046]	While replaying the sample playback part, the DRM-enabled mobile device<br>
monitors for a playback end point of the sample playback part (S215).<br>
[0047]	When the playback end point of the sample playback part is detected, the<br>
DRM-enabled mobile device terminates replaying the sample playback part (S217).<br>
[0048]	The processes from step S211 to step S217 can be performed with reference to<br>
the headers field of the file format of Table 1. The header field includes metadata containing<br>
additional information on the media file, especially on the sample playback part of the rights-<br>
protected media file.<br>
[0049]	In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the header field is<br>
specified as shown in Table 2.<br>
[0050]<br><br><br>
[0051]	The DRM-enabled mobile device refers to information of the header field<br>
shown in Table 2 and replays the sample playback part according to the information of the<br>
header field.<br>
[0052]	After terminating replaying the sample playback part, the DRM-enabled<br>
mobile device displays order types for purchasing a license on the rights-protected media file<br>
together with a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of a web server at which a user obtains a<br>
license for the rights-protected media file (S219).<br>
[0053]	While displaying the license order types, the DRM-enabled mobile device<br>
determines whether a key input is performed for purchasing the license (S221).<br>
[0054]	If a key input is performed for purchasing the license, the DRM-enabled<br>
mobile device performs an operation for purchasing the license (S223).<br>
[0055]	FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating a procedure of replaying a sample playback<br>
part of the rights-protected media file in the DRM method of FIG. 2.<br>
[0056]	In FIG. 3 the procedure of replaying the sample playback part of the rights-<br>
protected media file is performed with reference to Table 2 and it is assumed that the<br>
playback requested media file is a rights-protected media file.<br>
[0057]	Referring to FIG. 3, if it is determined that the playback requested media file<br>
is a rights-protected media file, the DRM-enabled mobile device checks information<br>
contained in the header of the media file (S301) and determines whether the user has a license<br>
for the media file on the basis of the information (S303).<br>
[0058]	Through steps S301 and S303, if a playback request input is detected, the<br>
DRM-enabled mobile device can determine whether the user has a license to replay the media<br>
file with reference to the information contained in the header of the media file, shown in<br>
Table 1. The ContentURI field in Table 1, which is a unique identifier of the rights-protected<br>
media file, is the information with which the DRM-enabled mobile device can determine<br>
whether the user has the license for the rights-protected media file.<br>
[0059]	If it is determined that the user has the license for the rights-protected media<br>
file, the DRM-enabled mobile device starts replaying the rights-protected media file (S305).<br>
[0060]	If it is determined that the user does not have the license for the rights-<br>
protected media file, the DRM-enabled mobile device determines whether the rights-<br>
protected media file has a sample playback part (S3 07).<br><br>
[0061]	The DRM-enabled mobile device can determine whether a sample playback<br>
part exists by referring to a value of the SamplePlayEnable field shown in Table 2. The<br>
SamplePlayEnable field includes information on the existence of the sample playback part<br>
and whether to allow replaying the sample playback part.<br>
[0062]	Accordingly, the DRM-enabled mobile device can determine whether the<br>
sample playback part exists in the rights-protected media file on the basis of the<br>
SamplePlayEnable field.<br>
[0063]	If it is determined that the sample playback part does not exist or replaying the<br>
sample playback part is refused, the DRM-enabled mobile device terminates the procedure<br>
for replaying the sample playback part.<br>
[0064]	If the sample playback part exists and the playback of the sample playback<br>
part is allowed, the DRM-enabled mobile device extracts information on the start time (S309)<br>
and on the end time (S311) of the sample playback part from the StartTimeLen n field and<br>
the EndTimeLen n field in Table 2, respectively.<br>
[0065]	The StartTimeLen n field and the EndTimeLen n field can be created<br>
corresponding to the TimeNum n field, which indicates the quantity of the sample playback<br>
parts of the rights-protected media file.<br>
[0066]	For example, if there are two sample playback parts, the TimeNum n field is<br>
set as TimeNum 2 such that the StartTimeLen n field contains start time information on the<br>
first and second sample playback parts and the EndTimeLen n field contains end time<br>
information of the first and second sample playback parts.<br>
[0067]	That is, in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a plurality of<br>
sample playback parts can be set for a single rights-protected media file.<br>
[0068]	Once the information on the start and end times of the sample playback part of<br>
the rights-protected media file is extracted, the DRM-enabled mobile device replays the<br>
sample playback part on the basis of the extracted information (S313).<br>
[0069]	That is, the DRM-enabled mobile device starts replaying the sample playback<br>
part of the rights-protected media file at the start time and ends replaying the sample<br>
playback part of the rights-protected media file at the end time.<br>
[0070]	After ending the playback of the sample playback part, the DRM-enabled<br>
mobile device determines whether another sample playback part exists (S315). In order to<br>
determine the quantity of the sample playback parts, the DRM-enabled mobile device refers<br><br>
to the TimeNum n field of Table 2. If more than one sample playback parts exist, the DRM-<br>
enabled mobile device replays the sample playback parts in a sequential order.<br>
[0071]	If it is determined that another sample playback part does not exist, the DRM-<br>
enabled mobile device ends the procedure of replaying the sample playback part (S317).<br>
[0072]	As described above, the DRM method and DRM-enabled mobile device of the<br>
exemplary embodiments of the present invention allow an unlicensed user to replay a sample<br>
playback part of a rights-protected media file, whereby it is possible to improve user<br>
convenience and stimulate purchase desire of users.<br>
[0073]	Also, since the DRM method and DRM-enabled mobile device of the<br>
exemplary embodiments of the present invention allow a user to experience sample content<br>
of a rights-protected media file, the user can verify whether the media file is that desired.<br>
[0074]	Further, due to the improvement of user convenience through sampling the<br>
rights-protected contents, the DRM method and DRM-enabled mobile device of the<br>
exemplary embodiments of the present invention have an effect of decreasing illegal copying<br>
and increasing distribution of the rights-protected contents.<br>
[0075]	The present invention can also be embodied as computer-readable codes on a<br>
computer-readable recording medium. The computer-readable recording medium is any data<br>
storage device that can store data which can thereafter be read by a computer system.<br>
Examples of the computer-readable recording medium include, but are not limited to, read-<br>
only memory (ROM), random-access memory (RAM), CD-ROMs, magnetic tapes, floppy<br>
disks, optical data storage devices, and carrier waves (such as data transmission through the<br>
Internet via wired or wireless transmission paths). The computer-readable recording medium<br>
can also be distributed over network-coupled computer systems so that the computer-readable<br>
code is stored and executed in a distributed fashion. Also, function programs, codes, and<br>
code segments for accomplishing the present invention can be easily construed as within the<br>
scope of the invention by programmers skilled in the art to which the present invention<br>
pertains<br>
[0076]	While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain<br>
exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood that various changes in form and<br>
details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present<br>
invention as defined by the appended claims.<br><br>
