Distamycin A and analogues thereof hereinafter referred to as distamycin and distamycin-like derivatives, are known in the art as cytotoxic agents useful in antitumor therapy.<br>
Distamycin A is an antibiotic substance with antiviral and antiprotozoal activity, having a polypyrrole framework [Nature 203:1064 (1964); J. Med. Chem. 32:774-778 (1989)]. . The international patent applications WO 90/11277, WO 98/04524, WO 98/21202, WO 99/50265, WO 99/50266 and WO 01/40181 (claiming priority from British patent application No. 9928703.9), all in the name of the applicant itself and herewith incorporated by reference, disclose acryloyl distamycin derivatives wherein the amidino moiety of distamycin is optionally replaced by nitrogen-containing ending groups such as, for instance, cyanamidino, N-methylamidino, guanidino, carbamoyl, amidoxxme, cyano and the like, and/or wherein the polypyrrole framework of distamycin, or part of it, is replaced by varying carbocyclic or heterocyclic moieties.<br>
The present invention provides, in a first aspect, a pharmaceutical composition for use in antineoplastic therapy in mammals, including humans, comprising a phaxmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient;<br><br><br>

The above compounds of formula (I), either specifically identified as such or by means of the general formula, are known or easily prepared according to known methods as reported, for instance, in the aforementioned international patent applications WO 90/11277, WO 98/04524, WO 98/21202, WO 99/50265, WO 99/50266 and WO 01/40181.<br>
The present invention further provides a product comprising an acryloyl distamycin derivative of formula 0), as defined above, and an antineoplastic topoisomerase I or H inhibitor, as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in antitumor therapy.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention is to provide a method of treating a mammal, including humans, suffering from a neoplastic disease state, which method comprises administering to said mammal the above acryloyl distamycin derivative of formula (J) and an antineoplastic topoisomerase I or n inhibitor, in amounts effective to produce a synergistic antineoplastic effect<br>
The present invention also provides a method for lowering the side effects caused by antineoplastic therapy with an antineoplastic agent in a mammal in need thereof including humans, the method comprising administering to said mammal a combined preparation comprising an antineoplastic topoisomerase I or II inhibitor and an acryloyl distamycin derivative of formula (I), as defined above, in amounts effective to produce a synergistic antineoplastic effect.<br>
By the term "synergistic antineoplastic effect* *, as used herein, it is meant the inhibition of the growth tumor, preferably the complete regression of the tumor, by administering<br><br>
an effective amount of the combination comprising an acryloyl distamycin derivative of formula (I) and a topoisomerase I or II inhibitor to mammals, including humans. By the term "administered " or "admimstering", as used herein, it is meant parenteral and/or oral administration; the term "parenteral" means intravenous, subcutaneous and intramuscular administration.<br>
In the method of the present invention, the acryloyl distamycin derivative may be administered simultaneously with the compound having topoisomerase I or II inhibitory activity, for example with a compound of the camptothecin, anthracycline, mitoxantrone, epipodophyllotoxin, or acridine class. Alternatively, both compounds may be administered sequentially in either order.<br>
In this respect, it will be appreciated that the actual preferred method and order of administration will vary according to, inter alia, the particular formulation of the acryloyl distamycin of formula (I) being used, the particular formulation of the topoisomerase I or H inhibitor being used, for instance the camptothecins such as CPT-11, topotecan, 9-AC; the anthracyclines such as doxorubicin, daunorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin, nemorubicin; the anthraquinones such as mitoxantrone and losoxantrone; the epipodophyllotoxins such as etoposide, teniposide; the acridine derivatives such as amsacrine and actinomycin D, the particular tumor model being treated as well as the particular host being treated.<br>
To administer the acryloyl distamycin derivative of formula (I), according to the method of the invention, the course of therapy generally employed comprises doses varying from about 0.05 to about 100 mg/m2 of body surface area and, more preferably, from about 0.1 to about 50 mg/m2 of body surface area.<br>
For the administration of the topoisomerase I or H inhibitor, according to die method of the invention, the course of therapy generally employed comprises<br>
when administering camptothecins: doses varying from about 1 to about 1000 mg/m2 of body surface area and, more preferably, from about 10 to about 500 mg/m2 of body surface area;<br>
when administering anthracyclines: doses varying from about 0.1 to about 1000 mg/m2 of body surface area and, more preferably, from about 0.5 to about 500<br><br>
mg/m of body surface area;<br>
when administering epipodophyllotoxins: doses varying from about 1 to about 500 mg/m of body surface area and, more preferably, from about 10 to about 400 mg/m2 of body surface area;<br>
when administering anthraquinones: doses varying from about 1 to about 300 mg/m of body surface area and, more preferably, from about 5 to about 100 mg/m of body surface area.<br>
when administering acridine and actinomycin D derivatives: doses varying from about 1 to about 1000 mg/m2 of body surface area and, more preferably, from about 10 to about 500 mg/m2 of body surface area.<br>
The antineoplastic therapy of the present invention is particularly suitable for treating breast, ovary, lung, colon, kidney, stomach, pancreas, liver, melanoma, leukemia and brain tumors in mammals, including humans.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention is directed to the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective amount of an acryloyl distamycin derivative of formula (T), as defined above, and an antineoplastic topoisomerase I or II inhibitor, in the preparation of a medicament for use in the prevention or treatment of metastasis or in the treatment of tumors by inhibition of angiogenesis.<br>
As stated above, the effect of an acryloyl distamycin derivative of formula (I) and a topoisomerase I or II inhibitor, such as an antbracycline or etoposide derivative, is significantly increased without a parallel increase of toxicity. In other words, the combined therapy of the present invention enhances the antitumoral effects of the acryloyl distamycin derivative and of the topoisomerase I or H inhibitor and, hence, provides the most effective and least toxic treatment for tumors.<br>
The superadditive effects of the combined preparations of the invention are shown, for instance, by the following in vivo tests, which are intended to illustrate the present invention without posing any limitation to it<br><br>
