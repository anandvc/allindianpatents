				<td>ARRANGING SUBSCRIBER BILLING IN TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[00Q1] The invention relates to billing a subscriber in a telecommu¬nication system, and particularly to billing a subscriber in a multi-provider envi¬ronment in a mobile communication system. The mobile communication sys¬tem generally refers to any telecommunication system which enables wireless communication when users move in the service area of the system. A typical mobile communication system is a public land mobile network PLMN.<br>
[0002] Telecommunication systems are Increasingly changing over to a multi-provider environment wherein access is provided by an access op¬erator, telephony by a telephony operator and actual services by one or more service providers. This is the case particulariy in systems called third genera¬tion mobile communication systems, such as a universal mobile communica¬tions system UMTS. In the UMTS, for example, the actual mobile communica¬tion network can operate as an access network providing the user with wire¬less access to external networks, such as Internet-protocol IP networks and the services thereof, such as IP telephony IPT. One access network usually provides access to several external networks, which can be of a similar type. There can be several telephony operators, for example, which provide the IPT service. When the access operator is not the telephony operator, both opera¬tors typically collect their billing infonnation in their own networks and bill the subscriber separately. A service provider itself does not maintain the network but purchases a necessary network service from the network operator, which collects billing information on behalf of the service provider as if it were the network operator's own billing information. The network operator also bills the subscriber on behalf of the service provider. In other words, if the service pro¬vider purchases the network sen/ice from the access operator, the access op¬erator is responsible for collecting the billing infonnation on the service and for billing according to an agreed tariff. The telephony operator operates In a similar manner if the sen^ice provider should purchase the network service from the telephony operator.<br>
Jtin^ A service of the mobile communication systems becoming increasingly popular is a prepaid subscription. The prepaid subscription in¬volves no billing in an-ears but the account of the prepaid subscription is charged in real time during calls. The prepaid subscriptton can usually be used<br><br>
for chargeable calls until the credits in the subscription's account run out, in other words until the prepaid amount has been exhausted. Usually, the sub¬scriber to the subscription, or someone else, can deposit more money in the subscription's account.<br>
{OOM^ The problem is, however, how to implement a prepaid sub¬scription which requires real-time billing during a call in a system comprising an access operator and a telephony operator, which both collect their own billing infonnation and do not know each other's tariffs. For an end user, It is inconvenient if he or she is compelled to have at least two separate prepaid subscriptions, one being a subscription to the access operator and the other to the telephony operator. The same problem also arises in connection with a service similar to the prepaid subscription wherein the maximum amount of a bill, i.e. the maximum sum of money that a bill Is allowed to be during a billing period, has been detemriined for a subscription to be billed in anrears'.<br>
[0000]* It would also be more convenient for subscribers billed "normally" in an-ears to receive a single combined bill instead of separate bills sent by the operators.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[ftO^ej-An object of the Invention Is thus to provide a method and an apparatus implementing the method so as to alleviate the above-mentioned problems.<br>
poo?} The objects of the invention are achieved by the method and telecommunication system which are characterized by what Is disclosed In the independent claims. Prefenred embodiments of the method and system of the invention are disclosed in the attached dependent claims.<br>
[OOOej The idea underiying the Invention is that Infomnation is transmitted from a first networi
 <br>
own prices for their services independently of each other. A still further ad¬vantage of the invention is that it is possible to provide both a user of a prepaid subscription and a user of a balance-limited subscription with the same alter¬natives to choose a telephony operator in a multi-provider environment as conventional subscribers (i.e. those to be billed normally in an-ears).<br>
[OOQ&amp;j In a first prefen-ed embodiment of the invention, in a network of a telephony operator, a subscriber is identified as a joint billing subscriber, i.e. e.g. as a subscriber who has a prepaid subscription to an access network or as a subscriber to be billed in arrears, who wants to receive^ a single bill. When the subscriber has been identified as a joint billing subscriber, the tariff of the telephony operator is transmitted to the networi
[P010J In a second and a third preferred embodiments of the inven¬tion, a globally unique billing identifier is generated in the network node of the access network, and the billing identifier is transmitted to the network nodes which collect billing information, regardless of the network node being a net¬work node of the access network or the telephony operator. The identifier en¬ables a billing centre responsible for billing to combine the billing Information received from different operators. A further advantage of these embodiments is that they inevitably take into account all special events affecting a billing procedure.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for arranging subscriber billing in a telecommunication system wherein a subscriber desiring a service uses both a first network and a second network in the telecommunication system, both networks having billing tariffs of their own, which method comprises the following steps of receiving a connection setup request, for which the subscriber is billed; characterized by identifying the subscriber as a joint billing subscriber; transmitting a tariff of the second network to a node carrying out billing in the first network; combining the tariffs of the first network and the second network in the node; and billing the subscriber according to the combined tariff.<br>
The present invention also provides a telecommunication system comprising at least one first network and at least one second network for providing a subscriber with a service, both networks having billing tariffs of their own, characterized in that the system is arranged to identify the subscriber as a joint billing subscriber and combine a tariff used in the first network with a tariff used in the second network and bill the subscriber according to the combined tariff.<br>
The invention is now described in closer detail in connection with the preferred embodiments and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which :<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[Qfi18j The present invention can be applied to any telecommunica¬tion system wherein infomnation necessary for billing a subscriber exists In at least two different networks. Such systems include systems called third gen¬eration mobile communication systems, such as the universal mobile tele¬communications system UMTS and IS-41, and mobile communication systems similar to the GSM system, such as a GSM 1800 and systems based on the aforementioned systems, such as GSM 2+ systems. The invention can also be applied to fixed systems wherein two separate operators can operate. The invention will be described in the following using a 3GPP All-IP system, i.e. an UMTS system based on IP technology and specified In a 3"* generation part¬nership project 3GPP, as an exemplary system, without restricting the inven¬tion thereto. The specifications of mobile communication systems, and those of the third generation mobile communication systems in particular, are ad¬vancing rapidly; consequentiy, the Invention may require additional changes. All words and expressions should therefore be interpreted broadly since they are only intended to illustrate, not to restrict, the Invention, The essential point for the invention is tiie function, not tiie network node in which tiie function is located.<br>
4001?] Figure 1 shows a simplified network architecture, describing<br>
only some of the elements of a system architecture. The networic nodes illus¬<br>
trated in Figure 1 are logical units, the implementation of which may differ from<br>
the described one. It is obvious to one skilled in the art that tiie system may<br>
also comprise other functions and structures which need not be described in<br>
closer detail here. In Figure 1, the broken lines between network nodes denote<br>
signalling connections while the unbroken lines denote signalling and data<br>
transmission links.	,<br>
(aa4«} In a 3GPP All-IP system 1, an access layer A and a teleph¬ony layer T will be separated, and both can have operators of their own. The system 1 comprises at least one of the both layers. Within the scope of the present invention, an access layer con-esponds to an access networi
 <br>
access operator and a telephony layer corresponds to a telephone network of a telephony operator. Usually, when not roaming, a subscriber always uses the same access operator while he or she may select the telephony operator to be used. As far as the invention Is concerned, the structure of the access layer and the telephony layer is irrelevant. The 3GPP All-IP system is based on a GPRS service of the pan-European global system for mobile communica¬tions GSM system and an intelligent network service Implementation according to a customised applications for mobile network enhanced logic CAMEL ar¬chitecture. The GPRS and the CAMEL are GSM 2+ phase services.<br>
[0010] User equipment UE comprises an actual terminal and an identification card USIM, also called a subscriber identification unit, detachably connected thereto. In this connection, the user equipment UE generally refers to a unity comprising the actual tenninal and the subscriber identification unit. The subscriber identification unit USIM is a smart card which compnses sub¬scriber identity and which performs authentication algorithms and stores authentication and cipher keys and subscription infomiation necessary at the user equipment The actual tenninal can be any equipment capable of conn-municating in a mobile communication system. The terminal can thus be a simple tenninai for speech only, or it can be a terminal for various sen/ices, operating as a service platfonn and supporting loading and canying out differ¬ent service-related functions. The temninal can also be a combination of sev¬eral different devices, for example a multimedia computer with a Nokia card phone connected thereto to provide a mobile connection.<br>
[0000} In the first preferred embodiment of the invention according to Figure 1, the telephony layer T comprises, In addition to the actual IP net-wort^ IP, a call state control function CSCF, a media gateway control function MGCF and an execution environment CSE_T con-esponding to a service con¬trol point in an intelligent network.<br>
f0004j The CSCF controls call establishment and is responsible for routing, and comprises, for example, a function corresponding to a switching function in an intelligent network. The CSCF provides IP telephony services with end-to-end control. Signalling associated with the IP telephony, such as H.323 and SIP, terminates at the user equipment and the CSCF. In other words, the CSCF Is the networic node in which IP telephony user equipment are registered and via which the signalling is transferred. The CSCF comprises IP telephony call state models, which are used for controlling call establish-<br><br>
ment with other network nodes, such as the service control point CSE_T. The CSCF can also communicate with IP telephony application servers (not shown in Figure 1). The CSCF comprises a subscriber database, which logically cor¬responds to a visitor location register in the GSM system. The CSCF is re¬sponsible for producing both telephony billing information and service billing information. The telephony billing infomnation is used, according to the billing policy and mechanisms specified by the IP telephony network operator, for billing for the use of basic telephony, different data bearers and additional services. The service billing infonnation is generated by the service provider. Service billing is carried out on a pay-by-use basis and calculated according to a contract between the sen/ice provider and the subscriber. Both billing proce¬dures are preferably controlled by the service control function in the intelligent network or methods detenmined by open interfaces {OSA, Parlay).<br>
-[OODfl] In the first prefen-ed embodiment of the Invention, the serv¬ice control function CSE_T of the IP telephony operator controls billing In the IP telephony network T. In addition, it may control call establishment in an in¬telligent-network-like manner. The service control function CSE_T may com¬prise all service logic and control associated with billing and different services, and necessary databases or a connection to the databases. The service con¬trol function is only a logical function and it can be internally implemented in different ways. An alternative is that it is internally decentralized and the re¬lated service logic can be decentralized in different nodes. Also the service information can be decentralized in different nodes from the service logic.<br>
jOOaO] The MGCF is an example of new network nodes provided in the network of the telephony operator. The MGCF mainly collects infonnation on data amounts transmitted on the physical connection since the CSCF knows nothing about them.<br>
jOOailf In the first prefenred embodiment of the invention, the main parts of the access layer A are: a core network CN, a UMTS ten-estrial radio access network UTRAN and a camel service environment CSE_A, which cor¬responds to a sen/ice point in an intelligent network.<br>
tQOggj The UTRAN comprises a number of radio network sub¬systems (not shown in the figure) connected to the core network CN. A radio network sub-system comprises a radio network controller RNC and one or more B nodes nodeB. The radio network controller RNC is a networi
 <br>
a base station controller in the GSM system. In each connection between the user equipment UE and the UTRAN, one RNC is a serving RNC. The main task of the B node nodeB is to process (channel coding and multiplexing, rate adjustment, decoding, etc.) a layer 1 of an air interface. It also carries out some management operations of the basic radio resource, such as controlling inner circuit power. The B node nodeB corresponds logfcally to a base station in the GSM system.<br>
fflOaS] The core network CN can be connected to external net¬works, such IP networks IP. In the example of Figure 1, the core networi
JDOa?j The support nodes SGSN and GGSN are usuall;^ Intercon¬nected by a backbone network (not shown in the figure). It Is to be noted that the SGSN and GGSN functionalities can also be physically connected to the same network node, in which case the backbone network of the operator Is unnecessary. Logically, however, the nodes are different nodes. The IP te¬lephony is in practice Invisible to the elements of the core network. For the support nodes SGSN and GGSN, the IP telephony is only a PDP context, i.e. a transmission link, with certain service quality requirements. The signalling associated with the IP telephony usually tenninates at the user equipment and the CSCF, so there is no need for the SGSN or GGSN to understand it.<br>
jOOaO] The serving GPRS support node SGSN is a node which serves the user equipment UE located in its area. In a packet radio network of the cellular type, each support node SGSN provides mobile data terminals, I.e. the user equipment UE, with packet data service in the area of one or more cells in its service area. The SGSN can participate In collecting billing infomia-tion in the access network. The SGSN according to the first prefen-ed em¬bodiment of the invention comprises a functfen similar to the service switching function in an intelligent network.<br>
(OQaflj"The GPRS gateway support nodes GGSN connect the op¬erator to systems extemal to the GPRS network, such as the IP network IP. The GGSN can also be connected directly to a private company network or a host. The GGSN operates as a router between an extemal address and inter-<br><br>
nal routing data (e.g. SGSN). The GGSN can participate in collecting the bill¬ing information of the access networl<.></.>
[0030] The home subscriber server HSS logically con-esponds to the home location register in the GSM system, subscriber information for each subscriber being stored therein permanently or semi-permanently such that the subscriber information is combined with a subscriber identifier, which, for example, is an IMSI in the GSM system. The CSCF of the IP telephony net¬work has a signalling connection to the HSS.<br>
[OOCH] In the first prefen-ed embodiment of the invention, the access networi
■[OOiaj IP telephony is a general term which covers services from the standard voice telephony voice* over IP VoIP to multimedia applications using IP data, voice and video in the IP telephony. In addition to the IP teleph¬ony, the above-described system supports other applications, such as access to the Intemet or an infranet. Similariy, an IP call refers to a call which utilizes IP-based user infomnation flow and signalling. The user information may com-<br><br>
prise several different components, such as voice, video image and data. In addition to calls, the IP telephony may comprise call-like services, which can be unidirectional, directed to a group (or groups) or broadcast in a given area, for example. In the IP telephony, mobile communication systems utilize new protocols, such as a wireless application protocol WAP.<br>
-{0009]' In addition to prior art means, a system and its network nodes implementing the functionality of the present invention comprise means for implementing functions described in closer detail in connection with Figures 2, 3 or 4. To be more precise, they comprise either means for identifying a joint billing subscriber and for transmitting billing tariffs from a network to an¬other and for billing the subscriber according to a billing tariff obtained by combining the billing tariffs of the two networks, or means for generating a global billing identifier and for transmitting the Identifier to the nodes that col¬lect billing Information. It is also feasible that the system and its network nodes comprise all means mentioned above. In addition, the user equipment may comprise means for storing the global billing Identifier and for transmitting the billing identifier to at least one of the networks. The existing network nodes and user equipment comprise processors and memory that can be utilized in the functions of the invention. All changes necessary for implementing the In¬vention can be earned out as additional or updated software routines and/or by application circuits (ASIC).<br>
■(00043 Figure 2 shows signalling according to the first prefen-ed embodiment of the invention when a call using the IP telephony Is made from the user equipment UE using a prepaid subscription. It is an example of serv¬ices chargeable from the subscription of the user equipment, for which the functionality according to the first prefen-ed embodiment of the invention can be utilized. In the example of Figure 2, It is assumed that the user equipment has a subscription both to the access operator and the telephony operator but a prepaid account only to the access operator. The subscription to the teleph¬ony operator is used by the CSE_T to identify the subscription of the user equipment as a prepaid subscription. In other embodiments of the invention, the prepaid subscription can be identified in other ways and in these embodi¬ments, the user equipment only needs a single subscription, preferably a sub¬scription to the access operator. For the sake of clarity, it is assumed that the user equipment has made its presence known to the access network by per-fomiing a GPRS attach operation. In the GPRS attach procedure, the SGSN<br><br>
creates a mobility management MM context, and a logical link control LLC is provided between user equipment UE and the SGSN node at the protocol layer.<br>
[no?B]' Furthermore, it is for the sake of clarity assumed that the user equipment UE has activated the PDP context, i.e. packet data address, It wishes to use. The PDP context specifies different data transfer parameters, such as a PDP type (X.25 or IP, for example), PDP address (IP address, for example), quality of service QoS and a network service access point identifier NSAPl. During the activation of the PDP context, the SGSN has encountered a subscriber-specific trigger (detection point), as the result of which it has re¬quested context processing instructions from at least the service control func¬tion of the access operator which is responsible for maintaining the account of the prepaid subscription. The SGSN receives the address of the control func¬tion from, for example, the home subscriber server HSS, or it may "have been set as a default value in the trigger. As the processing instructions, the SGSN receives from the control function CSE_A different threshold values, for exam¬ple, such as a reporting condition by which the.CSE_A requests an an¬nouncement from the SGSN when a certain amount of information has been transmitted from the user equipment UE when the billing is based on the transmitted amount of information. This exchange of information Is not shown in Figure 2.<br>
jOOOfi) Furthermore, it is for the sake of clarity assumed that the user equipment has registered itself In a CSCF and the call Is routed to the CSCF. It Is irrelevant to the Invention how tiie CSCF Is chosen during registra¬tion. In other embodiments of the invention, the call can be routed to another CSCF in which the user equipment is not registered.<br>
t0fl?7&gt;ln Figure 2, the process starts when the user equipment UE transmits a connection setup request 2-1. The SGSN ti-ansmits the message to the GGSN, which transmits the call setijp request 2-1 to the CSCF. Recep¬tion of the call setup request 2-1 results in encountering, at the CSCF, a trig¬ger (Detection Point) to initiate the service, which causes the CSCF to transmit a request 2-3 for instructions to the service control function CSE_T of tiie te¬lephony operator. The service control functi'on CSE_T detects in step 2-4 that the call concems a prepaid subscription, and the service control function CSE_A is responsible for the prepaid account of the prepaid subscription. In the first prefen-ed embodiment of the invention, this infomnation is located, for<br><br>
example, in the database of the CSE_T, or the operators may have a common database to use. In another prefen-ed embodiment of the invention, the CSE_T may infer, on the basis of the telephone number of the caller, for example, that a prepaid subscription is at issue and request the address of the service con¬trol function CSE_A responsible for the prepaid account from the HSS via the CSCF.<br>
iflP^^j- Since the subscription is a prepaid subscription, the CSE_T sends, in a message 2-5, the tariff of the telephony operator and instaicts the CSCF that the tariff of the telephony operator Is to be transmitted to the CSE_A and all special events during the call are to be reported to the CSE_A. The message 2-5 preferably comprises the address of the CSE_A. After re¬ceiving the address 2-5, the CSCF transmits a message 2-6, which comprises the telephony operator tariff Information and Indicates the telephony operator to the CSE_A, to the CSE_A maintaining the account of the prepaid subscrip¬tion. If no further intelligent-networi
[0080] If the operators have a mutual contract, the CSE_A com¬bines the tariff of the telephony operator and the tariff of the access operator in order to charge the prepaid account according to the combined tariff. In addn tion, the CSE_A transmits an instruction to the CSCF In a message 2-8A to continue call establishment. The message 2-8A may also comprise other in-fomnation related to the intelligent-network-like controlling, such as amning of detection points. The message 2-8A may also comprise, for example, report¬ing conditions or changes of previous reporting conditions. When the connec¬tion has been established, the prepaid account is charged according to the combined tariff mainly on the basis of infomiatlon reported by the SGSN. If the CSCF detects a special event, i.e. an event which could not have been taken into account in tariff formation, it informs the CSE_,A of the event so the CSE_A can acknowledge the event in the charging of the prepaid account The access operator transmits the telephony operator's share in the billing of the connection to the telephony operator, preferably In arrears.<br>
4Qfl4ej If the operators do not have a mutual contract, the CSE_A infonns the CSCF of this in a message 2-8B, whereafter the CSCF preferably<br><br>
terminates call establishment and informs the user equipment UE of the fact that the selected telephony operator cannot be used,<br>
[00 ^4j In a prefen-ed embodiment of the invention, the tariff of the telephony operator is known in the CSCF. In this embodiment, the message 2-5 does not contain the tariff.<br>
JDMSf In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the CSE_A and the CSE_T may directly intercommunicate. In this embodiment, the CSE_T directly infonns the CSE_A of the tariff of the telephony operator, and the CSE_A replies to the CSE_T with the message 2-8A or 2-8B. In this embodi¬ment, messages 2-5 and 2-6 are unnecessary but the connection between the CSCF and the CSE_T cannot be disconnected. In this embodiment, the CSE_T transmits the infomnation on special events to the CSE_A.<br>
JOOIO] In a preferred embodiment of the Invention, the prepaid sub¬scription is a subscription to the telephony operator, In which case the CSE_T (or the like) is responsible for charging the prepaid subscription. In this em¬bodiment, the CSE_T detects in step 2-4 that a connection setup request sup¬plied via an access operator A is at issue and requests the access operator tariff information from the CSE_A (or a con^esponding network node compris¬ing the tariff infomiation) in the messages 2-5 and 2-6 via the CSCF. The CSE_A returns the tariff infonnation if the operators have a mutual contract, whereafter the CSE_T combines the tariffs and charges the account according to the combined tariff. In another embodiment, the contract information are located at the CSE_T and It requests the tariff Information only if a contract exists. Yet in another prefenred embodiment of the Invention, the CSE_T com¬prises, besides the contract infomiation, also the tariff of the access operator. In this embodiment tariff Infonnation needs not be requested but it will suffice that the CSCF combines the tariff of the access operator with the tariff of the telephony operator. In this embodiment, when the tariff of the access operator changes, the change is updated in the CSE_T. This can be perfonned by util¬izing automatic updating, for example.<br>
[0811J Although in connection with Figure 2 the first preferred em¬bodiment with its different altematives has been disclosed in connection with a prepaid subscriptipn, it is obvious to one skilled in the art that the invention according to the first preferred embodiment can also be applied in connection with subscribers to be billed in arrears e.g. for producing a single bill to a sub¬scriber and/or for monitoring a balance limit.<br><br>
[noifi^ Figure 3 shows signalling according to a second prefen-ed embodiment of the invention. In the example of Figure 3, it Is for the sake of clarity assumed that the user equipment UE has a subscription to the access operator, which settles the bills between the operators if the telephony opera¬tor is not the same as the access operator. Each operator, in turn, settles with its service providers the billing related to the use of the services. In some other embodiments of the Invention, the user may have a subscription both to the access operator and the telephony operator. For the sake of clarity, it is further assumed that the user equipment has made its presence known to the access network by canying out a GPRS attach operation. In the GPRS attach proce¬dure, the SGSN creates a mobility management MM context, and a logical link Is provided between the user equipment UE and the SGSN node at the logical link control LLC protocol layer. Furthermore, it Is assumed for the sake of clar¬ity that the user equipment has been registered In the CSCF, and a call Is routed to that CSCF. The way In which the CSCF is chosen In connection with the registration is In^elevant to the invention. In other preferred embodiments of the invention, a call may be routed to a CSCF in which the user equipment is not registered.<br>
{0040] In Figure 3, the process starts when the user equipment ac¬tivates a PDP context, whidi, according to what has been disclosed above, detennines different data transmission parameters, such as a PDP type (X.25 or IP, for example), PDP address (IP address, for example), quality of service QoS and a network service access point identifier NSAPI. Activation of the PDP context is started by transmftting a message 3-1 (Activate PDP Context Request) from the user equipment UE to the SGSN. Next, the SGSN and the user equipment may carry out security functions, e.g. authentication of the user equipment. These are not shown in Figure 3. After receiving the message 3-1, the SGSN retrieves the address of the GGSN and transmits a message 3-2 (Create PDP Context Request) to the GGSN. In response to the message 3-2, in step 3-3 the GGSN generates a global billing identifier CJD. The global billing identifier is preferably a combination of an integer identifying the PDP context in the GGSN and the address of the GGSN. The billing identifier thus fomned is a globally unique one. Preferably, a running number is used as the identifying integer. Instead of the address of the GGSN, the address of an¬other network element may also be used, the Integer then preferably identify¬ing the PDP context In the particular network element. The billing Identifier<br><br>
may also be formed in other ways. The point in the second embodiment of the invention is that the billing identifier is unique in the system formed by different interacting networks such that call detail records relating to the same PDP context that are supplied to a billing centre always contain the same billing identifier, which cannot be confused at the billing centre with the billing identi¬fiers used by other PDP contexts.<br>
[0047] After generating the billing identifier C_ID (and after creating the infonnation necessary for routing), the GGSN transmits a message 3-4 (Create PDP Context Response), which comprises the billing identifier CJD as a new parameter. The SGSN separates the billing identifier C_ID from the message 3-4 and, in step 3-5, stores the billing identifier CJD as the billing identifier to be used in this PDP context, and transmits the billing identifier CJD to the user equipment UE in a message 3-6 (Activate PDP Context Ac¬cept) indicating that the activation of the PDP context has succeede8.<br>
jnn^Sj After receiving the message 3-6, in step 3-7 the user equip¬ment UE stores the billing identifier C_ID as the billing identifier related to the particular PDP context. When the user desires a service from the networl^, e.g. to set up a call, in step 3-8 the user equipment attaches the billing identifier to a setup message 3-9 (Set up) and transmits the message 3-9- to the CSCF. In step 3-10, the CSCF stores the billing identifier in its memory to be used in the billing of this connection. The CSCF transmits the billing identifier to the MGCF in a message 3-11, and in step 3-12, the I^GCF stores the billing identifier in its memory to be used in the billing of this connection.<br>
^010] Figure 3 shows no other signalling related to connection setup. After the connection has been set up, certain, network nodes (in the ex¬ample of Figure 3 the SGSN, GGSN, CSCF and MGCF) collect billing infor¬mation, each transmitting call detail records CDR to a billing centre BC in messages 3-13a, 3-13b, 3-13c, 3-13d. The call detail records comprise the billing identifier CJD. Using the billing identifier CJD, the billing centre BC combines the call detail records supplied from the different network nodes into a sum to be billed from the subscriber. A prepaid account can also be charged each time after any of the messages 3-13a, 3-13b, 3-13c or 3-13d has been received, in which case combining the billing events means that each call de¬tail record comprising the same billing identifier will charge a certain account. The con-ect account is found on the basis of the billing Identifier. The billing<br><br>
centre can be a separate centre or e.g. a networl
[QOfiOj In the second prefen-ed embodiment, the network nodes of the telephony operator (CSCF and MGCF) remove the billing identifier CJO from their memory while the connection is being disconnected. In the second preferred embodiment, the user equipment UE and" the network nodes of the access network (SGSN and GGSN) remove the billing identifier CJD from their memory while the PDP context is being deactivated. Removing refers to the infonnation no longer being available.<br>
[flOBI}* In a prefen^ed embodiment utilizing the second embodiment of the invention, a joint billing subscriber is identified either In the GGSN or the SGSN, and the billing identifier is transmitted to the user equipment only If the subscriber is a joint billing subscriber. In this embodiment, the user equipment is an-anged to attach the billing identifier to the message 3-9 only ff It has re¬ceived one in the message 3-6.<br>
EOOfig] Figure 4 shows signalling according to a third preferred em¬bodiment of the invention. The same assumptions are made In the example of Figure 4 as in the example of Figure 3. Furthermore, it is assumed in the ex¬ample of Figure 4 that the interface between the access layer and the teleph¬ony layer Is located between the GGSN and the CSCF.<br>
[005^3 In Figure 4, the process starts when the user equipment UE starts activating the PDP context by transmitting a message 4-1 (Activate PDP Context Request) from the user equipment UE to the SGSN. Next, the SGSN and the user equipment may carry out security functions, e.g. authentication of the user equipment. These are not shown in Figure 4. After receiving the mes¬sage 4-1, the SGSN retrieves the address of the GGSN and transmits a mes¬sage 4-2 (Create PDP Context Request) to the GGSN. In response to the message 4-2, in step 4-3 the GGSN generates a global billing identifier CJD, The global billing identifier is described in doser detail in connection with Fig¬ure 3.<br>
J0004] After generating the billing identifier CJD (and after creating the information necessary for routing), the GGSN transmits a message 4-4 (Create PDP Context Response), which comprises the billing identifier CJD as a new parameter. The SGSN separates the billing identifier CJD from the message 4-4 and, in step 4-5, stores the billing identifier CJD as the billing identifier to be used in this PDP context. The GGSN also transmits the billing<br><br>
identifier C_ID to the CSCF i a message 4-6. In step 4-7, the CSCF stores the billing identifier In its memory to be used in the billing of this transmission link. The CSCF transmits the billing identifier to the MGCF in a message 4-8, and in step 4-9, the MGCF stores the billing identifier in its memory to be used in the billing of this connection.<br>
.[noifi^ When a connection, e.g. a call, has then been set up from the user equipment, certain network nodes (in the example of Figure 4 the SGSN, GGSN, CSCF and MGCF) collect billing infomiatlon using the billing identifier CJD detemnined for the transmission link used by the connection, each network node transmitting call detail records CDR to the billing centre BC. The call detail records comprise" the billing identifier CJD. The transmis¬sion of the call detail records is not shown in Figure 4. In the third preferred embodiment, the billing centre BC operates In a similar manner to that shown in the second preferred embodiment in connection with Figure 3; therefore, Its operation will not be described in closer detail herein.<br>
^000} In the third prefen^ed embodiment, the network nodes of the telephony operator (CSCF and MGCF) and the network nodes of the access network (SGSN and GGSN) remove the billing identifier CJD from their memory while the PDP context is being deactivated. Removing refers to the infomnation no longer being available.<br>
[OOUTJ In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the message 4-6 comprising the billing Identifier CJD is transmitted to the CSCF only when a connection is being set up from the user equipment.<br>
too GO] In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the CSCF requests the billing identifier CJD from the GGSN e.g. In response to receiv¬ing a setup message (message 3-9 in Figure 3). In this embodiment, the GGSN is an-anged to transmit the message 4-6 In response to the billing iden¬tifier CJD request received from the CSCF.<br>
[OOiO] If the interface between the access layer and the telephony layer is located somewhere else, the billing Identifier CJD is transmitted to the CSCF via this interface, which means that the message 4-6 shown In Figure 4 is not needed but some other message/other messages is/are transmitted in¬stead. If the interface is located e.g. between the HSS and the CSCF, the HSS can transmit the billing identifier to the CSCF. The HSS can be infomried of the billing identifier either by the SGSN or the GGSN.<br><br>
^000&amp;] In prefen-ed embodiments of the invention according to the second and third prefen-ed embodiments, the global billing identifier is not generated in connection with activating the PDP context (transmission link) but only when the user of the user equipment desires a service from the network. In these embodiments, messages 3-1 and 3-2 or 4-1 and 4-2 are used for re¬questing generation of a billing identifier either directly or indirectly, and in the embodiment according to the second prefen-ed embodiment, step 3-7 can be omitted since the user equipment merely relays the billing identifier generated in the network by the access operator to the network node(s) of the telephony operator. In these embodiments, the billing identifier is preferably removed from the memory of the network node while the connection is being discon¬nected.<br>
[0061t It is also feasible that the billing identifier is generated in the network node of the telephony operator, from which it is transmitted either di¬rectly or via the user equipment to the network node(s) of the access network.<br>
^0062} In a prefen-ed embodiment utilizing the second and third embodiments of the invention, a joint billing subscriber is identified either In the GGSN or the SGSN, and the billing identifier is transmitted to the user equip¬ment or the CSCF only if the subscriber is a joint billing subscriber. In such an embodiment utilizing the second embodiment, the user equipment is an^nged to attach the billing identifier to the message 3-9 only If It has received one in the message 3-6.<br>
[0009] The second and third embodiments (and embodiments de¬rived therefrom) of the Invention may also be used both in connection with subscriptions to be billed in an-ears and balance-limited subscriptions to be billed in arrears and in connection with prepaid subscriptions as well.<br>
[0064} Some or all signalling messages shown in Figures 3 and 4 may be e.g. messages based on GPRS tunneling protocol GTP, H.323 and/or session initiation protocol SIP protocols.<br>
[00663 The signalling messages and steps shown in Figures 2, 3 and 4 are not shown in absolute chronological order and they can be imple¬mented in a different order from the given one. Other signalling messages can be transmitted and/or other functions can be carried out between the mes¬sages and/or steps. For example, in the second prefen-ed embodiment of the invention, it can be checked in step 3-9 whether the operators have a contract enabling joint billing, and the process can continue as shown In Figure 3 when<br><br>
such a contract exists. Some steps shown in Figures 2 and 3 can also be omitted. If, for example, in the first preferred embodiment of the invention the same operator is both the telephony operator and the access operator, the CSE_T and the CSE_A can be the same service control point, in which case in step 2-4, the CSE_T detects that it is itself responsible for the account of the prepaid subscription, so no message 2-5 will be transmitted but the tariffs are combined as shown in step 2-7. No message 2-6 will then be transmitted ei¬ther. The signalling messages are only examples and they may comprise sev¬eral separate messages for transmitting the same information. Furthennore, the messages may also comprise other information. The names of the mes¬sages may also differ from those disclosed above.<br>
[nnfifi] It is to be understood that the above description and the re¬lated figures are only intended to illustrate the present invention. Different variations and modifications of the invention will be obvious to orife skilled in the art without deviating from the scope and spirit of the invention disclosed in the attached claims.<br><br><br>
