Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
Referring to the drawings, the best mode for carrying out the present invention is explained in detail.<br>
Fig.l shows an embodiment of a picture recording and/or reproducing system according to the present invention. A personal computer 1-1 is fed with signals supplied from an antenna 2, adapted for receiving electrical waves transmitted from a specified television broadcasting station, and reproduces a specified picture and speech, that is picture and speech of a so-called television program, while recording the picture and the speech. The personal computer 1-1 also reproduces the picture and<br><br>
the speech corresponding to analog signals supplied from VCR (video cassette recorder) 3 or digital data supplied from DVCR (digital video cassette recorder) 4, over a network 5, such as IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers) 1394, while recording the picture and the speech.<br>
The personal computer 1-1 sends analog signals corresponding to the recorded speech and picture to the VCR 3, or sends digital data corresponding to the recorded picture and speech to the DVCR 4.<br>
The personal computer 1-1 transmits to the server 7 a message requesting transmission of data for recording reservation of a pre-set program of a pre-set television station, referred to below as recording reservation data, through a network 6, such as Ethernet or Internet, based on the procedure such as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). The server 7 is a so-called Web server, adapted for receiving a message requesting transmission of recording reservation data for recording reservation of a pre-set program of a pre-set television broadcasting station, transmitted from the personal computer 1-1, referred to below as the recording reservation data, to transmit to the personal computer 1-1 data for reserved recording of the pre-set program of the pre-set television broadcasting station, associated with the message.<br>
The personal computer 1-1 receives data for recording reservation of the pre-set program of the pre-set television broadcasting station, to execute reserved recording of the pre-set program based on the received data.<br><br>
The personal computer 1-2 appends recording reservation data for recording reservation of the pre-set program of the pre-set television broadcasting station to an E-mail to send the resulting E-mail over the network 6 to the personal computer 1-1. The personal computer 1-1 receives the E-mail transmitted from the personal computer 1-2 to execute the reserved recording of (fie program by exploiting the recording reservation data attached to the E-mail.<br>
In Fig.2, the personal computer 1 is connected to a potable telephone set 17, over a telephone network 16, in response to a call (dial call) from the potable telephone set 17 having a pre-set browser function. Based on a procedure, such as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protucol), the personal computer 1 transmits data hm inputting data for reservation recording or selecting the setting for reservation recording to the potable telephone set 17 to receive data for reservation recording of a pre-set program of a pre-set television broadcasting station, referred to below as recording reservation data, to set reservation recording based on the received recording reservation data. The personal computer 1 executes reservation recording of a pre-set program based on the reservation recording setting.<br>
The potable telephone set 17 has the function of a so-called browser such as i-mode (trademark) and invokes the personal computer 1 through a base station 18 and the telephone network 16 to display a pre-set text or figure based on data furnished from the personal computer 1. The user of the potable telephone set 17, who is also a user of the personal computer 1, inputs the setting for making reservation recording<br><br>
of a pre-set program of a pre-set television station, based on the pre-set text or figure demonstrated on the potable telephone set 17 by the browser function.<br>
Based on the input setting for reservation recording the pre-set program of the pre-set television station, the potable telephone set 17 generates pre-set reservation recording data, in meeting with a pre-set processing operation, to transmit the recording reservation data to the personal computer 1 over the base station 18 and the telephone network 16.<br>
Fig.3 is a block diagram for illustrating the structure of the personal computer 1. A CPU (central processing unit) 21 executes a variety of application programs or a basic operating system (OS). A read-only mei.iory (ROM) 22 generally stores basic stationary data among parameters for arithmetic operations or programs used by the CPU 21. A RAM (random-access memory) 23 stores a program used by the CPU 21 in its operation and parameters incidentally changed as the program proceeds. These components are interconnected by a host bus 24 constructed by a CPU bus or a memory bus.<br>
The host bus 24 is connected via a bridge 25 to an external bus 26, such as a PCI (peripheral component interconnect/interface) bus.<br>
A keyboard 28 is acted upon by a user inputting various commands to the CPU 21. A mouse 29 is acted on by the user commanding or selecting a point on a screen of a cathode ray tube (CRT) 30 configured for demonstrating the various information by texts or images. An HDD (hard disc drive) 31 and an FDD (floppy disc drive) 32<br><br>
actuate a hard disc and a floppy disc, respectively, to cause the hard disc or the floppy disc to record and/or reproduce the information or the program executed by the CPU 21. A loudspeaker 33 reproduces the specified speech. The above components from the keyboard 28 to the loudspeaker 33 are connected to an interface 27, which in turn is connected to a CPU 71 over the external bus 26, bridge 25 and the host bus 24.<br>
A picture processing board 34 generates specified picture or speech data, based on signals supplied from an antenna 2, digital picture or speech data supplied from the DVCR 3, or picture or speech digital data supplied from the DVCR 4 or the DVCR 5, through the network 6-1, to output the generated data via the external bus 26 and the interface 27 to the HDD 31.<br>
The picture processing board 34 is fed with picture or speech data, recorded on the HDD 31, through the external bus 26 and the interface 27, to generate analog signals corresponding to the input picture or speech data, to send the generated signals to the VCR 3. Alternatively, the picture processing board 34 generates digital data, corresponding to the input picture or speech data, to send the generated data over the network 5 to the DVCR 4.<br>
The picture processing board 34 is connected over the external bus 26, bridge 25 and the host bus 24 to the CPU 71.<br>
A communication board 35 is a device for connection to the network 6. In more detail, it is constituted by an Ethernet board etc and is connected over the external bus 26, bridge 25 and the host bus 24 to the CPU 71.<br><br>
The structure of the picture processing board 34 is now explained. Fig.4 shows the structure of the picture processing board 34. The 1394 interface 51 is configured in meeting with the prescriptions of the IEEE 1394 and is connected to the networks. The 1394 Interface 51 receives picture or speech digital data of the DVCR format, supplied from the DVCR 4 or the DVCR 5, based on the protocol consistent with the provisions of the IEEE 1394, to send the received data to a DV (Digital Video) data interface 52.<br>
The 1394 interface 51 also sends picture or speech digital data of the DVCR format, routed from the DV data interface 52, to the DVCR 4, based on the protocol in meeting with the presjriptions of the IEEE 1394.<br>
The DV data interface 52 outputs picture or speech digital data of the DVCR format, sent from the 1394 interface 51, and picture or speech digital data, routed from the digital selector 57, such as so-called non-compressed 4:1:1 digital data, to the DV data companding circuit 53, and also outputs the picture or speech digital data of the DVCR format supplied from the DV data companding circuit 53 to the 1394 interface 51, while outputting the non-compressed picture or speech digital data, supplied from the DV data companding circuit 53 and the digital selector 57, to the digital selector 57.<br>
The DV data companding circuit 53 expands the picture or speech digital data of the DVCR format, supplied from the DV data interface 52, to non-compressed picture or speech digital data, to output the expanded digital data to the DV data<br><br>
interface 52. The DV data companding circuit 53 also compresses the non-compressed picture or speech digital data, supplied from the DV data interface 52, into picture or speech digital data of the DVCR format, to output the resulting compressed digital data to the DV data interface 52.<br>
The tuner 54 is fed with RF (radio frequency) signals, fed from the antenna 2, to output picture or speech analog signals of a specified channel to the analog selector 52. The analog selector selects one of the picture or speech analog signals, sent from the tuner 54, VCR 3 or the D/V (digital/analog) conversion circuit 61, to output the selected signals to the A/D (analog/digital) conversion circuit 56 or the VCR 3.<br>
The A/D conversion circuit 56 
The MPEG encoder 58 compresses the picture or speech digital data, sent from the digital selector 57, to digital data of the MPEG system, to output the resulting data to the bridge 59. The MPEG encoder 58 also converts a scene change picture into a still picture which is output to the bridge 59.<br>
The bridge 59 outputs the non-compressed picture or speech digital data,<br><br>
supplied from the digital selector 57, to the CRT 30, through the PCI bus 26 of the personal computer 1, carrying the picture processing board 34, and through the interface 27. The bridge 59 outputs the picture or speech digital data of the MPEG system, sent from the MPEG encoder 58, through the PCI bus 26 of the personal computer 1 carrying the picture processing board 34 to the HDD 31 or to the CPU 21. The bridge 59 also receives the picture or speech digital data of the MPEG system from the HDD 31 of the personal computer 1 over the PCI bus 26 to output the received digital data to the MPEG decoder 60.<br>
The MPEG decoder 60 expands the picture or speech digital data of the MPEG system, supplied from the bridge 59, into non-com pressed picture or speech digital data, to output the expanded data to the digital selector 57.<br>
The D/A conversion circuit 61 converts the picture or speech digital data, supplied from the digital selector 57, into analog signals, which are output to the analog selector 55.<br>
Meanwhile, the processing corresponding to the MPEG encoder 58 or the MPEG decoder 60 may be executed by the CPU 21 in accordance with a specified program.<br>
Fig.5 illustrates the structure of the server 7. The CPU 81 actually executes a variety of application programs or a basic OS. A ROM 82 stores basically fixed data among parameters for arithmetic operations and the program used by the CPU 81. The RAM 83 stores the program used in the execution of the CPU 81 or parameters<br><br>
incidentally  changed  during the  program  execution.  These  components  are interconnected over a host bus 84 constituted by the CPU bus or the memory bus.<br>
The host bus 84 is connected through the bridge 85 to an external bus 86, such as a PCI bus.<br>
A keyboard 88 is acted upon by a user inputting various commands to the CPU 81. A mouse 89 is acted upon by the user making commands or selection of points on a screen of a CRT 90. The CRT demonstrates the various information by texts or images. An HDD 91 and an FDD 92 drive the hard disc or the floppy disc to cause the hard disc or the floppy disc to record and/or reproduce the information or the program executed by the CPU 81. These components from the keyboard 8f, to the FDD 92 are connected to an interface 87, which in turn is connected to the CPU 71 through an externa] bus 86, a bridge 85 and a host bus 84.<br>
A communication board 93 is a device for connection to the network 6, constructed by e.g., an Ethernet board, and is connected to the CPU 71 through the external bus 86, bridge 85 and the host bus 84 to the CPU 71.<br>
Since the structure of the personal computer 1-2 is similar to that of the server 7 and hence is not explained here specifically.<br>
Fig.6 illustrates an application program executed by the personal computer 1. A recording and/or reproducing program 101 causes the picture processing board 34 to select one of the picture or speech analog signals of a specified channel, as received by the tuner 54, picture or speech analog signals, sent from the VCR 3, and the picture<br><br>
or speech digital data sent over the network 5 from the DVCR 4. The recording and/or reproducing program 101 also converts the selected analog signals or digital data into picture or speech digital data of the MPEG system to record the resulting digital data in the HDD 31 as AV (audio visual) contents made up of one or more files of a pre-set format.<br>
The recording and/or reproducing program 101 also causes the picture processing board 34 to expand the AV contents, recorded on the HDD 31 as one or more files of a predetermined format, to generate pre-set non-compressed picture or speech digital data to display the picture on the CRT 30 as well as to reproduce the speech by the loudspeaker 3 J.<br>
An AV content management retrieval program 102 demonstrates the pre-set information, such as the date and time of recording or the AV contents recorded on the HDD 31. The AV content management retrieval program 102 also commands the recording and/or reproducing program 101 to reproduce the pre-set AV contents to select the AV contents as an object of editing to supply the information of the selected AV content information to an AV content editing program 103 to command reservation recording to an reservation recording setting program 104.<br>
Based on the AV contents recorded on the HDD 31, the AV content editing program 103 edits the pre-set picture and speech of the selected AV contents, that is connects the picture and the speech contained in the pre-set AV contents, to generate AV contents of a pre-set form reproducing the edited picture or speech.<br><br>
The AV contents are not provided with picture or speech digital data, and are constructed by the information specifying the AV contents as selected, the information exploiting the selected information and the information specifying the speech, and hence can be reproduced by the recording and/or reproducing program 101.<br>
The reservation recording setting program 104 generates the AV contents executing the reservation recording, based on the setting. These AV contents are responsive to the setting (recording time and recording mode determining the picture quality) to secure the storage area for the HDD 31 at the outset. The reservation recording setting program 104 also generates the AV contents executing the reservation recording based on the record ng reservation data furnished from the WWW (World Wide Web) browser 106 or an E-mail program, not shown.<br>
A reservation monitoring program 105 is perpetually in operation (that is, resident) when the personal computer 1 is running (that is when the OS is running) to execute the reservation recording based on the AV contents lor executing the reservation recording generated by the reservation recording setting program 104 and on the time supplied from an RTC (Real Time Clock). The reservation monitoring program 105 also changes the setting of the AV contents executing the reservation recording.<br>
The WWW (World Wide Web) browser 106 requests the server 7 to transmit pre-set recording reservation data, in accordance with the pre-set procedure such as HTTP, and receives pre-set recording reservation data to send the received data to the<br><br>
reserved recording setting program 104.<br>
A CGI program 106" transmits data displaying a specified menu, data for selecting the setting of the reservation recording or data indicating the state of reservation of the personal computer 1, to the portable telephone set 17, based on the specified procedure, such as HTTP, through a web server 125, in accordance with a program stated in a pre-set script. The CGI program 106" receives pre-set recording reservation data from the portable telephone set 17 to send the recording reservation data to the recording reservation setting program 104.<br>
Fig.7 illustrates the structures of the application program executed by the personal computer 1, middleware and the drivers.

In the following, explanation on the speech is omitted.<br>
Fig.9 shows an illustrative structure of the AV contents. In the content database 122, recorded in the HDD 31, there are recorded attributes of the respective AV<br><br><br>
contents. In an AV content attribute record 152-1, recorded in the content database 122, there are stored data, such as name, ID (identification data), date and time of formulation, date and time of change, date and time of recording, channel name, recording mode, state, term of validity, shown by date and time, setting of the mistaken deletion, presence or absence of errors, two-dimensional bar code and memo, as attributes of the AV contents 151-1. In an AV content attribute record 152-2, recorded in the content database 122. there are stored data, such as name, ID, date and time of formulation, date and time of change, date and time of recording, channel name, recording mode, state, term of validity, setting of the mistaken deletion, presence or absence of enors and memo, as attributes of the AV contents 151-2.<br>
The recording mode data stored in the AV content attribute record 152-1 indicate that the moving picture data files 161-1-1 to 161-1-3 are one of high quality, standard and video CD compatible, which video CD compatible specifies that the picture data are of the MPEG-1 system. On the other hand, the status data stored in the AV content attribute record 152-1 indicate that the AV content attribute record 151-1 is in an reservation queue, in recording state, in the recording and/or reproducing state, that is in the state of recording data and reproducing recorded picture data, in the non-reproducing state, in the reproducing state or in the replay end state.<br>
The error indicates the states of the AV content attribute record 151-1, such as the personal computer 1 malfunctioning during recording, recording aborted partway,<br><br>
recording state during recording being bad such that input signals from the antenna 2 are not reproduced, or partial dropout of the moving picture file 161-1-1.<br>
As for the setting of the term of validity and the setting for inadvertent deletion, neither one is set, or one of them is set, while it does not occur that both are set simultaneously.<br>
The recording mode data stored in the AV content attribute record 152-2 indicate that the moving picture data files 161-2-1 to 161-2-3 are one of high quality, standard and video CD compatible. On the other hand, the status data stored in the AV content attribute record 152-2 indicate that the AV content attribute record 151-2 is in the reservation queue, in recording state, in the recording and/or reproducing state, in the non-reproducing state, in the reproducing state or in the replay end state.<br>
The AV content attribute record 151-1 is made up of moving picture data files 161-1-1 to 161-1-3, recorded on the HDD 31, and of moving picture data files 162-1-1 to 162-1-3, recorded on the HDD 31. In the moving picture data files 161-1-1 to 161-1-3, there are stored picture data of the MPEG system. The picture corresponding to the picture data stored in the leading end of the moving picture data file 161-1-2 is consecutive to a picture corresponding to picture data stored in the trailing end of the moving picture data file 161-1-1. Similarly, thepicture corresponding to the picture data stored in the leading end of the moving picture data file 161-1-3 is consecutive to a picture corresponding to picture data stored in the trailing end of the moving picture data file 161-1-2.<br><br>
In a still picture data file 162-1-1, picture data corresponding to a still picture converted from a scene change picture of picture data stored in the moving picture data file 161-1-1 and data on the scene change time are stored. In a still picture data file 162-1-2, picture data corresponding to a still picture converted from a scene change picture of picture data stored in the moving picture data file 161-1-2 and data on the scene change time are stored. In a still picture data file 162-1-3, picture data corresponding to a still picture converted from a scene change picture of picture data stored in the moving picture data file 161-1-3 and data on the scene change time are stored.<br>
The AV contents 151-2 are made up of the muving picture data files 161-2-1 to 161-2-2 and still picture data files 162-2-1 and 162-2-2, and are similar to the AV contents 151-1. Therefore, the AV contents 151-2 are not explained specifically.<br>
If there is no necessity of demarcating the AV contents 151-1 and the AV contents 151-2 from each other, these are simply termed an AV contents 151. If there is no necessity of demarcating the AV contents attribute record 152-1 and the AV contents attribute record 152-2 from each other, these are simply termed an AV contents attribute record 152. If there is no necessity of demarcating the moving picture data files 161-1-1 to 161-1-3 from one another, or if there is no necessity of demarcating the moving picture data files 161-2-1 or 161-2-2 from each other, these are also termed a moving picture data file 161. In addition, if there is no necessity of demarcating the still picture data files 162-1-1 to 162-1-3 or the still picture data files<br><br>
162-2-1 or 162-2-2 from one another, these are simply termed a still picture data file 162.<br>
The picture the recording and/or reproducing program 101 displayed on the CRT 30 of the personal computer 1 is hereinafter explained. Fig.10 shows a picture displayed on the CRT 30 of the personal computer 1 when the picture recording operation is possible.<br>
In a picture recording window 181 are set a channel for recording, a recording mode etc. When the picture recording is started, the recording and/or reproducing program 101 sets the operation of the tuner 54 of the picture processing board 34 or the MPEG encouer 58 of the picture processing board 34, based or the setting of the picture recording window 181, to generate pre-set AV contents 151 and the AV contents attribute record 152 for recording on the HDD 31.<br>
When the picture recording window 181 is selected and active, a picture recording button 182 and a recording stop button 183 are both active to enable the operation. That is, if the picture recording window 181 is selected and active, the recording and/or reproducing program 101 starts and halts picture recording when a recording button 182 is clicked and a stop button 183 is clicked, respectively.<br>
If the picture recording window 181 is selected and active, a playback button 184 and a pause button 185 are non-active, such that the recording and/or reproducing program 101 is not in operation even when the playback button 184 or the pause button 185 is clicked, respectively.<br><br>
Fig.ll illustrates a picture displayed on the CRT 30 of the personal computer 1 when the recording and/or reproducing program 101 has started picture recording. The picture recording window 181 displays the time elapsed as from start of picture recording and the current time in addition to the recording channel and the recording mode.<br>
When the recording is started, the recording button 182 is changed to a recording time change button 191. The recording time is changed whenever the recording time change bution 191 is clicked.<br>
A picture displayed when a specified AV contents 151 or AV contents 121 are reproduced by the recording and/or reproducing program 101 is explained. Fi^.12 illustrates a picture displayed on the CRT 30 of the personal computer 1 when the recording and/or reproducing program 101 is able to perform a reproducing operation.<br>
In a playback window 201 is displayed e.g., a picture recording mode of the AV contents to be reproduced. When the playback window 201 is selected and active, the stop button 183, playback button 184 and the pause button 185 are active to enable the operation. That is, when the playback window 201 is selected and active, the recording and/or reproducing program 101 starts, transiently stops and ultimately stops the reproduction when it is the reproducing button 184, pause button 185 and the stop button 183 that has been clicked, respectively.<br>
On the other hand, if the playback window 201 is selected and active, the picture recording button 182 is non-active, such that the recording and/or reproducing<br><br>
program 101 is not in operation even when the recording button 182 is clicked.<br>
Since the recording and/or reproducing program 101 is responsive to selection of the picture recording window 181 or the playback window 201 to change the recording button 182, stop button 183, reproducing button 184 or the pause button 185 to an active or non-active state, the user is able to know the possible contents of operation reliably and hence is able to operate speedily to prevent inadvertent operation.<br>
The picture recording reservation is hereinafter explained. Figs. 13 to 15 illustrate a picture displayed on the CRT 30 on startup of the reservation recording setting program 104. On startup, the reservation recording setting program 104 first demonstrates a window setting a channel for recording and date and time for start of picture recording, as shown in Fig. 13. The user sets the channel for recording and date and time for start of picture recording in each pre-set file of the window. In the illustrated embodiment, hour and minute are set in respective different fields.<br>
If, after setting the channel for recording and date and time for start of picture recording, a specified button, a button labelled "next" in the illustrated embodiment, is clicked, the reservation recording setting program 104 reads the channel for recording and data on the date and time of start of recording, as set in a specified field, to change the window to a window setting the end time and the recording mode shown in Fig.14.<br>
The reservation recording setting program 104 displays the channel as set for<br><br>
recording and data on the recording start date and time, in a window used for setting the end time and the recording mode, while display ing the end time and the recording mode in the respective fields. It is noted that hours and minutes are set in respective different fields.<br>
When the end time and the recording mode are set in this window, the reservation recording setting program 104 displays data usable as index for setting, such as using amount of the HDD 31. If the end time and the recording mode are set and a pre-set button, herein the button labelled "next", is clicked, the reservation recording setting program 104 reads-in the data of the end time and the recording mode, as set in pre-set fields, to change the window to a window for confirming the setting shown in Fig. 15.<br>
The reservation recording setting program 104 displays data, such as the channel for recording, time and date of start of recording, time and date of end of recording and the recording mode, in the window used for confirming the setting. If the pre-set button, herein a button labelled "end", is clicked, the reservation recording setting program 104 causes the AV contents 151, executing the reservation recording, to be recorded on the HDD 31, to register the AV contents attribute record 152 corresponding to the recorded AV contents 151 in the content database 122.<br>
The AV contents 151, executing the reservation recording, has, from the outset, a movingpicture data file 161, includinga recording area associated with the recording time and the recording mode.  If, for example, the quantity of data of a picture per<br><br>
second in a standard mode is 5 Mbits, the reservation recording setting program 104, set for recording for four hours in the standard mode, generates one or more moving picture data files 161, having a sum total of 9 Gbytes, in the HDD 31, in accordance with the following equation:<br>
14400 sec*(5M bits/sec)/(8 bits/byte) = 9G bytes since four hours is equal to 14400 seconds.<br>
The operation of the reservation recording setting program 104 generating the AV contents 151, designed for executing the reserved recording based on the pre-set recording reservation data downloaded from the server 7, is now explained. If the user boots the WWW browser 106, the personal computer 1-1 causes a preset picture to be displayed, based on the pre-set file stated in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) furnished from the server 7 over the network 6.<br>
Fig.16 shows a picture the personal computer 1-1 running the WWW browser 106 demonstrates on the CRT 30, based on a pre-set file supplied from the server 7. The personal computer 1-1 demonstrates the so-called program table. In this program table, there are arrayed pre-set recording reservation data download buttons 251-1 to 251-11 in association with the respective programs.<br>
If, for example, the reservation data download button 251-1 is clicked, the recording reservation data for reservation recording of the "news at 7 o"clock" of NHK General is downloaded to the personal computer 1-1. If the reservation data download button 251-2 is clicked, the recording reservation data for reservation recording of the<br><br>
"TV map" of NHK General is downloaded to the personal computer 1-1? If the reservation data download button 251-3 is clicked, the recording reservation data for reservation recording of the "drama" of NHK General is downloaded to the personal computer 1-1. If the reservation data download button 251-4 is clicked, the recording reservation data for reservation recording of the "local weather" of NHK General is downloaded to the personal computer 1-1.<br>
If the reservation data download button 251-5 is clicked, the recording reservation data for reservation recording of the "After School Club" of NHK Educational is downloaded to the personal computer 1-1. If the reservation data download button 251-6 is clicked, the recording reservation data for reservation recording of the "Dactylologic Corner" of NHK Educational is downloaded to the personal computer 1-1. If the reservation data download button 251-7 is clicked, the recording reservation data for reservation recording of the "Health for Tomorrow" of NHK Educational is downloaded to the personal computer 1-1. If the reservation data download button 251-6 is clicked, the recording reservation data for reservation recording of the "Dactylologic Corner" of NHK Educational is downloaded to the personal computer 1-1. If the reservation data download button 251-7 is clicked, the recording reservation data for reservation recording of the "Health for Tomorrow" of NHK Educational is downloaded to the personal computer 1-1.<br>
If the reservation data download button 251-8 is clicked, the recording reservation data for reservation recording of the "Tonight With You" of NHK<br><br>
Educational is downloaded to the  personal computer 1-1. If the reservation data download button 251-9 is clicked, the recording reservation data for reservation recording of the "Lets Learn Braille" of NHK Educational is downloaded to the personal computer 1-1.<br>
If the reservation data download button 251-10 is clicked, the recording reservation data for reservation recording of the "Processing-Baseball" of Nippon TV is downloaded to the personal computer 1-1. If the reservation data download button 251-11 is clicked, the recording resei vation data for reservation recording of the " Friday TV of Sun 1" of TBS is downloaded to the personal computer 1-1.<br>
Since the recording reservation data includes data necessary for recording reservation explained with reference to Figs. 13 to 15, except the recording mode, the personal computer 1-1 is able to record the AV contents of executing the reserved recording in the HDD 31, even in the absence of setting by the user, if the recording mode is previously set, and if the recording reservation data downloaded on actuating the recording reservation data downloading button s 251-1 to 251-11 is used.<br>
Fig. 17 shows an example of recording reservation data constituted by text data.<br>
The "Content-type: application/x-tv-program-info; charset jis", stated on line 1 of the recording reservation data, indicates that this data is the recording reservation data. In line 3 of the recording reservation data is stated, next to "station:", data for specifying a channel for recording. For example, in "station: Nippon TV" of Fig. 17, data for specifying the channel for recording is "Nippon TV".<br><br>
The data for specifying the channel for recording is converted into data specifying a pre-set channel (broadcasting station) by a processing in which the ambiguous description in a pre-set range is allowed and which exploits the channel conversion file shown in Fig. 18.<br>
For example, in a character sequence of the channel conversion file "4, 0,0,4, Nippon Television, Nippon TV, Nittele, Nippon TV Broadcasting Network, NT V", the first numerical figure from left "4" is data specifying the channel, the numerical figure "4" to the right o; the third comma from left is channel representing data and the letter sequence to the right of the fifth comma from left, divided by commas, that is "Nippon TV", "Nittele", "Nippon TV Broadcasting Network" and "NTV" denote "etter sequences for matching to the pre-set letter sequence of the channel conversion file.<br>
For example, if line 3 of the recording reservation data states: "station: Nippon TV", the reservation recording setting program 104 checks whether or not the letter string "Nippon TV" next to "station" is in agreement with the letter string next to the fifth comma from left in the channel conversion file.<br>
If the letter sequence "4, 0, 0, 4, Nippon Television, Nippon TV, Nittele, Nippon TV Broadcasting Network, NTV" is included in the channel conversion file, as shown in the embodiment of Fig. 18, the reservation recording setting program 104 verifies that the letter sequence "Nippon TV" (lying to the right of the fifth comma from left) is matched to the letter sequence of the channel conversion file.<br>
If the letter sequence of the recording reservation data is matched to that of (he<br><br>
channel conversion file, the reservation recording setting program 104 sets the data specifying the matched channel of the same line of the channel conversion file as a channel.<br>
For example, if the letter sequence "4,0,0,4, Nippon Television, Nippon TV, Nittele, Nippon TV Broadcasting Network, NTV" is matched to the letter sequence of the recording reservation data, the channel 4 is set.<br>
So, if the letter sequence for specifyingthe channel in the recording reservation data is one of "Nippon Television, Nippon TV, Nittele, Nippon TV Broadcasting Network, NTV", the remote controller 4 can set the channel 4 based on the recording reservation data.<br>
So, even if the letter sequence specifying the channel of the recording reservation data is ambiguous to more or less extent, the remote controller 4 can set the pre-set channel based on the recording reservation data.<br>
There is stated, on lines 4 to 7 of the recording reservation data, data for specifying the date and time of starting the recording, whereas, on line 8 thereof, there is stated data specifying the recording end time.<br>
The recording reservation data not only can be downloaded from the server 7, but also can be appended to an E-mail for transmission to the personal computer 1-1. Since the recording reservation data is constituted by letter string data, the user of the personal computer 1-2 is able to prepare the recording reservation data easily using e.g., a ubiquitous application program, such as a word processor or a text editor.<br><br><br>
If the personal computer 1-1 on receipt of the E-mail displays E-mail data by a pre-set E-mail program, the E-mail program demonstrates an icon 281 indicating that the recording reservation data is appended thereto, as shown for example in Fig. 19.<br>
If the icon 281 is clicked, the recording reservation data is stored in the reservation recording setting program 104, so that the personal computer 1-1 is able to use the recording reservation data.<br>
So, if the user of the personal computer 1-2 transmits recording reservation data, the user of the personal computer 1-1 is able to record the pre-set program.<br>
The operation of the reservation recording setting program 104 generating the AV contents 151 of executing the reservation recording b^sed on specified reservation data received from the portable telephone set 17 is explained. When the portable telephone set 17 accesses to the personal computer 1 through the telephone network 6, the personal computer 1 executes the processing of supplying the IP address to the portable telephone set 17 by the resident dial-up server 124 to set the connection to the portable telephone set 17. After setting the connection to the portable telephone set 17, the web server 125 of the personal computer 1 transmits a pre-set file stated in e.g., the HTML (hyper text markup language) or data furnished from the CGI program 106 to the portable telephone set 17 .<br>
Fig.20 illustrates a picture to be displayed by the portable telephone set 17 operating a pre-set browser based on a pre-set file furnished from the web server 125 of the personal computer 1.<br><br>
After the portable telephone set 17 accesses to the personal computer 1 through the telephone network 16, the web server 125 of the personal computer 1 transmits data for displayingthe picture for selecting the menu shown in Fig.20Ato the portable telephone set 17. The user of the portable telephone set 17 is able to select the reservation setting, confirmation of the AV contents recorded by the reserved recording or the display of the consumed amount of the HDD, as index of time recordable by reserved recording, in accordance with the menu shown in Fig.20A.<br>
Ir. keeping with the selection of the menu shown in Fig.20A, the portable telephone set 17 transmits to the personal computer 1 a message requesting the display of the setting for the reserve, corresponding to the command labelled "reserved" in the drawing, confirmation of the AV contents recorded by reservation recording, corresponding to the command labelled "recorded" in the drawing, or the display of the used amount of the HDD, as an index of the recordable time by recording reservation, corresponding to a command labelled "used amount of HDD" in the drawing.<br>
When the user selects a command labelled "reserved" of the menu shown in Fig.20A, and a message corresponding to the request for reservation setting is transmitted from the portable telephone set 17 to the personal computer 1, the CGI program 106" of the personal computer 1 transmits data for displaying a picture selecting the menu for adding or deleting the reservation, as shown for example in Fig.20B, through the web server 125 to the portable telephone set 17. When the<br><br><br>
command labelled "addition of reservation" shown in the example of Fig.20B is selected, the portable telephone set 17 transmits a message to the effect of addition of the recording reservation to the personal computer 1.<br>
In the example of Fig.20B, "1999/04/25 19:00 to 19.30 (8), Alince in Wonderland" denotes the contents of the recording reservation as already set in the personal computer 1. The personal computer 1 indicates that a program with the title "Alince in Wonderland", aired in channel 8 as from 19:00 until 19:30 on April 25, 1999, is to be recorder! by reserve. In similar manner, "1999/04/06 19:00 to 20:00 (4) Giants versus Tigers" denotes the contents of the recording reservation already set on the personal computer 1. Thus, the.personal computer 1 indicates that the program with the title "Giants versus Tigers", aired in channel 4 as from 19:00 until 19:30 on April 6,1999, is to be recorded by reservation recording.<br>
When the user selects the command labelled "addition of reserve" of the menu shown in Fig.20B, and the personal computer 1 transmits to the personal computer 1 a message to the effect that the reservation has been added, the web server 125 of the personal computer 1 causes the portable telephone set 17 to display a picture inputting a title of the program, date and time of airing, channel recording quality and memo, as shown for example in Fig.20C.<br>
Fig.20C shows an example in which the purport that a program with the title "Giants versus Tigers", aired in channel 4 as from 19:00 until 20:00 on April 7,1999, is to be recorded with high picture quality has been inputted to the portable telephone<br><br>
set 17. If, from this state, an operation for commanding the picture recording is made to the portable telephone set 17, the portable telephone set 17 generates recording reservation data, based on the input data, and transmits a message for appointing the recording, inclusive of the recording reservation data, to the personal computer 1. The web server 125 of the personal computer 1 sends a message for recording reservation including the recording reservation data to the CGI program 106, which then sends the recording reservation data to the recording reservation setting program 104 for reservation recording.<br>
The processing for reservation recording in case the reservation recording setting program 104 and the WWW browser 106 have been loaded on the RAM 23 so that the CPU 21 executes the reservation recording setting program 104 and the WWW browser 106 is now explained by referring to the flowchart of Fig.21. At step SI 1, the WWWbrowser 106 transmits a message requesting recording reservation data corresponding to a pre-set program to the server 7 in accordance with a user operation. At step 102, the WWW browser 106 verifies whether or not the recording reservation datn has been transmitted from the server 7. If it is found that the recording reservation data has not been transmitted from the server 7, the WWW browser 106 reverts to step 12 to repeat the processing until transmission of the recording reservation data from the server 7.<br>
If it is found at step S12 that the recording reservation data has been transmitted from the server 7, the WWW browser 106 proceeds to step S13 to receive the<br><br>
recording reservation data to send the received recording reservation data to the reservation recording setting program 104.<br>
At step S14, the reservation recording setting program 104 executes the processing for channel setting, based on the furnished recording reservation data. The processing for channel setting will be explained in detail with reference to Fig.22.<br>
At step S15, the reservation recording setting program 104 displays a reservation setting confirming message in a window shown for example in Fig. 15.<br>
At step S16, the reservation recording setting program 104 records the AV contents 151 in reservation queue, inclusive of a moving picture data file 161, which has acquired a pre-set region of the HDD 31, based on the furnished recording reservation data. At step S17, the reservation recording setting program 104 causes a contents database 152 to generate an AV contents attribute record 152, corresponding to the AV contents 151 in reservation queue, to terminate the processing.<br>
In this manner, the reservation recording setting program 104 and the WWW browser 106 are able to execute the reserving of a pre-set program speedily.<br>
The processing for channel setting, corresponding to step S14 of Fig.21, is explained with reference to the flowchart of Fig.22. At step S21, the reservation recording setting program 104 reads-in the recording reservation data furnished from the WWW browser 106. At step S22, the reservation recording setting program 104 reads out the character string next following "station" of the recording reservation<br><br>
data.<br>
At step S23, the reservation recording setting program 104 reads out a character string of a pre-set channel name from a channel conversion file. At step S24, the reservation recording setting program 104 verifies whether or not the character string next following "station" is coincident with the character string of a pre-set channel name. If it is verified that character string next following "station" is coincident with the character string of the pre-set channel name, the reservation recording setting program 104 proceeds to step S25 to set a channel corresponding to the character string of the pre-set channel name.<br>
At step S26, the reservation recording setting program 104 sets channel demonstration corresponding to the channel as set at step S25 (that is sets data for channel demonstration and data for channel name demonstration) to terminate the processing.<br>
If it is verified at step S24 that character string next following "station" is not coincident with the character string of the pre-set channel name, the reservation recording setting program 104 proceeds to step S27 to verify whether or not the totality of the character strings of the channel names have been read out. If it is verified that the totality of the character strings of the channel names have been read out, the reservation recording setting program 104 proceeds to step S28 to display a message reading that no channel has been found on a CRT 30 to terminate the processing.<br><br><br>
If it is verified at step S27 that the totality of the character strings of the channel names have not been read out, the reservation recording setting program 104 proceeds to step S29 to read out a character string of an other channel name. The reservation recording setting program 104 then reverts to step S24 to repeat the processing for verifying the possible character string coincidence.<br>
As described above, the reservation recording setting program 104 is able to set a pre-set channel despite certain ambiguity in the character string next following the "station" of the recording reservation data.<br>
Referring to the flowchart of Fig.23, the processing for furnishing recording reservation data by a server 7 in case the Web server program is loaded on a RAM 83 and a CPU 81 executes a Web server program, is now explained. At step S51, the Web server program receives a message from the personal computer 1-1 based on e.g., the HTTP. At step S52, the Web server program verifies whether or not a message received from the personal computer 1-1 is a message requesting pre-set recording reservation data. If it is verified that the message received from the personal computer 1-1 is a message requesting pre-set recording reservation data, the Web server program proceeds to step S53 to transmit recording reservation data corresponding to the message to the personal computer 1-1 to terminate the processing.<br>
If it is verified at step S52 that the message received from the personal computer 1-1 is not a message requesting pre-set recording reservation data, the step S53 is skipped to terminate the processing.<br><br><br>
In this manner, the server 7 furnishes pre-set recording reservation data to the personal computer 1-1.<br>
Referring to the flowchart of Fig.24, the processing of transmitting recording reservation data by the potable telephone set 17 is explained. At step Sill, the potable telephone set 17 calls the telephone number associated with the personal computer 1, and transmits the user name or the pre-set password to make connection to the personal computer 1. At step S112, verifies whether or not reservation recording is to be set, based on e.g., a menu selection input. If it is found that no reservation recording is to be set, the potable telephone set 17 reverts to step SI 12 to repeat the processing until reservation recording is set.<br>
If it is found at step S112 that the reservation recording is to be set, the potable telephone set 17 proceeds to step S113 to ask the potable telephone set 17 for data for preparing the recording reservation data.<br>
At step SI 14, the potable telephone set 17 demonstrates a pre-set picture, based on data for preparing the recording reservation data received from the personal computer 1, to accept inputting the setting of reservation recording. At step S115, the potable telephone set 17 decides whether or not to transmit the recording reservation data, based on the input at a pre-set button. If it is determined that the recording reservation data is not to be sent, the potable telephone set 17 reverts to step 114 to repeat the processing for inputting the setting for reservation recording.<br>
If it is determined at step SI 15 that the recording reservation data is to be<br><br>
transmitted, the potable telephone set 17 roceeds to^tep SI 16 where the potable telephone set 17 generates the recording reservation data based on the input reservation recording setting. At step S117, the potable telephone set 17 transmits the recording reservation data generated at step SI 16 to the personal computer 1 to terminate the processing.<br>
In this manner, the potable telephone set 17 is able to transmit the pre-set recording reservation data to the potable telephone set 17.<br>
Referring to the flowchart of Fig.25, the processing of receiving the recording reservation data of the personal computer 1 is explained. At step S131, the dial-up serverl24 of the personal computer 1 verifies whether or not the connection is being requested by the potable telephone set 17, by the processing corresponding to step Sill. If it is determined that the connection is not requested from the potable telephone set 17, the dial-up serverl24 reverts to step S131 to repeat the processing until connection is requested from the potable telephone set 17.<br>
If it is determined that the connection is requested from the potable telephone set 17, the dial-up serverl24 proceeds to step S132 where the dial-up serverl24 connects to the potable telephone set 17. At step S133, the web server 125 of the personal computer 1 verifies whether or not data for preparation of the recording reservation data corresponding to step S113 is being requested from the potable telephone set 17. If it is determined that the data for preparation of the recording reservation data is not being requested from the potable telephone set 17, the web<br><br>
server reverts to step S133_to repeat the processing until the data for preparing the recording reservation data is requested from the potable telephone set 17.<br>
If it is determined at step S133 that the data for preparing the data for preparing the recording reservation data is requested from the potable telephone set 17, the web server 125 proceeds to step S134 where the CGI program 106" of the personal computer 1 receives the recording reservation data in association with the processing at step SI 17 to send the received recording reservation data to the reservation recording setting program 104.<br>
At step S136, the reservation recording setting program 104 of the personal computer 1 records the AV contents 151 in the reservation queue, based on the received recording reservation data. At step S137, the reservation recording setting program 104 of the personal computer 1 generates the AV record attribute record 152 corresponding to the AV contents 151 in reservation queue generated at step S136 to terminate the processing.<br>
In this manner, the personal computer 1 is able to set the reservation recording based on the recording reservation data furnished from the potable telephone set 17.<br>
In carrying out the reservation recording by the above-described procedure, the API (application program interface) on the Windows (trademark) can be exploited as follows:<br>
In a dynamic library, having a filename of srr.dll, a number of APIs are included, and may be invoked using the C-language.<br><br>
11.<br>
The following are typical of the API. The manner of using the respective APIs is also explained.<br>
SrrOpenQ	API starts to be used<br>
SrrClose()	API ceased to be used<br>
SrrGetFirstChannel()	A first one of the channel list is acquired<br>
SrrGetNextChannelQ	The next one of the channel list is acquired<br>
SrrGetFirstReservation()	A first one of the reservation list is acquired<br>
SrrGefNextReservationQ	The next one of the reservation list<br>
SrrSetReservationQ	Reservation is to be set<br>
SrrDeleteReservationO	The reservation already set is deleted<br>
For reading-in the registered information, using the registered information, the API of a name beginning with the "SrrGetFirst" and the API of a name beginning with "SrrGetNext" are used. For example, if the channel information is to be read-in, "SrrGetFirstChannel" and "SrrGetNextChannel" are used.<br>
The SrrGetFirstChannel reads-in the first channel information. If, by the return value of the SrrGetFirstChannel, there is yet left the channel information to be read-in, the next information is acquired by the SrrGetNextChannel, and so on.<br>
1.	The first information is read in by the SrrGetFirst*Q.<br>
2.	Except if data to be read-in is left, the processing comes to a close.<br>
3.	The next information is read-in by SrrGetNext*().<br>
m<br><br>
4. Return to 2.<br>
In reading in the video capsule information, basically the same sequence is used.<br>
SrrVirtualChannel (structure for channel information)<br>
The SrrVirtualChannel is a structure for exchanging the channel information. The SrrVirtualChannel is used not only in the API for acquiring the channel information, but also as a member of the SrrRecordlnfo for handling the video capsule information, typedef struct_SrrVirtualChannel<br>
{<br>
WORD wVersion;	//version information<br>
WORD wCH;	//channel (frequency)<br>
WORD wDicspCh;	//(virtual) channel<br>
for display<br>
BYTEbCaption[SRR_MAX_CHANNEL_CAPTION];<br>
//caption for channel<br>
jSrrVirtualChannel:<br>
#define SRR_VCHANNEL_VERSION	(1)<br>
#define SRR_MAX_CHANNEL_CAPTION  (256)<br>
Basically, the value of this stricture is not prepared on the side program. Using<br>
the APIs of the SrrGetFirstChannei and SrrGetNextChannel, the channel information<br><br>
is acquired, using this structure, for utilization.<br>
If data is to be prepared on the side program, SRR_VCHANNEL_VERSION is substituted for wVersion. SrrTime (structure for date and time information)<br>
SrrDatel is a structure for exchanging the date/time information, such as date/time of reservation or recording. There is no API handling the data by itself and use is simply made as a member for holding the date and time of start and end with SrrRecordlnfo. typedef struct JSrrTime<br>
//version information<br>
//year A.D.<br>
//month<br>
//day<br>
//hour<br>
//minute<br>
{<br>
WORD wVersion;<br>
USHORTyear;<br>
Byte month;<br>
Byte day<br>
Byte hour;<br>
Byte minu*e<br>
} SrrTime;<br>
#define SRRJTIMEVERSION	(1)<br>
If data is to be formulated on the side program, SRRTIMEVERSION is substituted in mVersion.<br><br>
SrrRecorlnfo (structure for video capsule information)<br>
The SrrRecorlnfo is a structure used for exchangingthe video capsule structure. In the API handling the reserved video capsule or the recorded video capsule, the information is exchanged by this structure, typedef struct _SrrRecordInfo<br>
{<br>
WORD	Wversion; //version information<br>
DWORD	DwID; 7ID uniquely determining the video<br>
capsule<br>
SrrTime	StartTime; //recording start time<br>
SrrTime	EndTime; //recording end time<br>
WORD	WrecMode; //r; mode (picture quality)<br>
SrrVirtualChannel	svCh; // recording channel information<br>
BYTE	BprogramName [SRR_MAX_PROGRAM_NAME];<br>
//progran name<br>
BYTE	BprogramMemo [SRR_MAX_PROGRAM_MEMBER];<br>
//PROGRAM MEMO]; //program memo<br>
}SrrRecordInfo;<br>
#define SRR_MAX_PROGRAM_MEMO	(256)<br>
#define SRR_MAX_PROGRAM_MEMO	(4096)<br>
#define SRR_RECORDINFO_VERSION	(1) //w Version<br><br>
#define SRR_REC_MODE_HIGH	(l)//wRecMode<br>
=MPEG2 8 Mbps<br>
#define SRR_REC_MODE_NORMAL	(2) //wRecMode<br>
= MPEG2 4 Mbps<br>
#define SRR_REC=MODE_VIDEOCD	(3) //wRecMode<br>
= MPEG1 1.5 Mbps (VideoCD compatible) In thf APIs specifying an optional video capsule, the video capsule is specified using this structure dwID.<br>
If data is to be prepared on the side program, SPR=RECORDINFO_\"ERSION is substituted for wVersion.<br>
The dwID is an ID for identifying the video capsule automatically generated on the side srr.dll. If reference is made, no value is substituted on the side program.<br>
For wRecMode, one of constants beginning with the SRR_REC_MODE is specified.<br>

Referring to the flowchart of Fig.26, the processing for the reservation recording in case the reservation monitoring program 105 resident in the RAM 23 is executed by the CPU 21 is now explained.<br>
At step S71, the reservation monitoring program 105 reads out the current time from the RTC, not shown. At step S72, the AV contents attribute record 152 corresponding to the AV contents 151 in a pre-set reservation queue is read out.<br>
At step S73,the reservation monitoring program 105 compares the current time to the recording start time contained in the AV contents attribute record 152 to check whether or not the reservation recording is to be started. If it is verified that the reservation recording should be started, the program moves to step S74 to start the recording. The reservation monitoring program 105 overwrites data of the picture<br><br>
generated in the picture processing board 34 on the previously recorded data file 161.<br>
At step S75, the reservation monitoring program 105 reads out the current time from the RTC, not shown. At step S76, the reservation monitoring program 105 compares the current time to the recording end time contained in the AV contents attribute record 152 to check whether or not the recording reservation is to be terminated. If it is verified that the recording reservation is not at an end, the recording is continued so that the program moves to step S75 tc repeat the processing of verifying the end time.<br>
If it is verified at step S76 that the recording reservation is to be terminated, the program moves to step S77 where the reservation monitoring program 105 changes data of the AV contents attribute record 152 to a pre-set value. The recording then comes to a close to terminate the processing.<br>
If it is verified at step S73 that the recording reservation is not to be started, the program moves to step S78 where the reservation monitoring program 105 verifies whether or not the AV contents attribute record 152 corresponding to the entire AV contents 151 in the reservation queue has been read out in its entirety. If it is verified that the AV contents attribute record 152 corresponding to the entire AV contents 151 in the reservation queue has not been read out in its entirety, the program moves to step S79, where the reservation monitoring program 105 reads out the AV contents attribute record 152 corresponding to another AV contents 151 in the reservation queue. The program then reverts to step S73 to repeat the processing for decision as<br><br>
to starting the recording reservation.<br>
If it is verified at step S78 that the AV contents attribute record 152 corresponding to the AV contents 151 in the reservation queue has been read out in its entirety, there lack AV contents 151 that are to be recorded by reservation, so that processing comes to a close.<br>
As described above, the recording monitoring program 105 executes the reservation recording based on the AV contents 151 in the reservation queue and on the current time.<br>
The processing of transmitting recording reservation data by an E-mail program of the personal computer 1-2 is explained with reference to the flowchart of Fig.27. At step S91, the E-mail program of the personal computer 1-2 appends the recording reservation data to the E-mail. At step S92, the E-mail program transmits the E-mail, having the recording reservation data, appended thereto, to the personal computer 1-1 to terminate the processing.<br>
As described above, the E-mail program is able to transmit the recording reservation data to the personal computer 1-1. The personal computer, on receipt of the E-mail, having the recording reservation data, appended thereto, is able to make the reservation for recording by the processing similar to that explained with reference to the flowchart of Fig.21.<br>
Referring to Fig.28, a medium used in installing a program for executing the above-described sequence of operations on a personal computer 1-1 or 1-2 or in a<br><br>
