				<td>Lightweight component of hybrid design<br>
The present invention relates to lightweight components of hybrid design, also termed hybrid components or hollow-chamber lightweight components, composed of a shell-type parent body which is reinforced by means of thermoplastics and is suitable for the transmission of high mechanical loads, where particular flow aids are added to the thermoplastic in order to improve its physical properties.<br>
These lightweight components of appropriate design are used for vehicle parts, or in load-bearing elements of office machinery or of household machines or of other machinery, or in design elements for decorative purposes or the like.<br>
A feature of lightweight components of hybrid design, hereinafter also termed hybrid components, is interlock bonding of a shell-type parent body or, respectively, hollow body, mostly composed of metal, to a plastics part introduced into this or added onto this. For the purposes of the present invention, these are also termed hollow-chamber lightweight components.<br>
German Offenlegungsschrift 27 50 982 discloses a non-releasable connection involving two or more parts, preferably composed of metal, where the connection is composed of plastic and is produced in a mould which accepts the parts to be connected, for example by the injection-moulding process. EP-A 0 370 342 discloses a lightweight component of hybrid design composed of a shell-type parent body whose internal space has reinforcing ribs securely connected to the parent body, in that the reinforcing ribs are composed of moulded-on plastic and their connection to the parent body takes place at discrete connection sites by way of perforations in the parent body, through which the plastic extends and extends across the areas of the perforations, and a secure interlock bond is achieved. EP-A 0 995 668 supplements this principle in that the hollow-chamber lightweight component is additionally provided with a cover plate or cover shell composed of plastic. However, it is also possible to conceive of a cover plate composed of other materials, such as metal.<br>
WO 2002/068257 discloses what are known as integrated structures composed of metal and plastic with the description of a number of fastening means in order to provide secure connection of the two components to one another. WO 2004/071741 discloses the alternative procedure, namely using two operations first to mould the plastic onto the shell-type metal part in such a way that the plastic passes through openings in the metal part and leaves flash material on the other side, where an additional conversion operation is required before this material leads to a secure interlock bond. EP 1 294 552 Bl discloses that, for the production of a hybrid component, it is possible that the metal core has been not completely, but only sectionally, overmoulded by the plastic, to give a<br><br>
secure interlock bond. WO 2004/011315 discloses a further variant in which the metal part provides, both above and below, openings for the secure interlock bond with the overmoulded plastic. WO 2001/38063 describes a composite plastics part composed of at least two sheet-like workpieces of different material, for example plastic and metal, or of different metals or plastics, where the workpieces have been connected to one another in their peripheral region, and the connection is composed of moulded-on thermoplastic. EP 1 223 032 A2 discloses a sheet-type lightweight component of hybrid design. US 6,761,187 Bl discloses a hybrid component in the form of a channel or of a tube with integrated closure composed of a thermoplastic. DE 195 43 324 A1 discloses how the metal component for use as hybrid component can be prepared in order to achieve a secure interlock bond with the thermoplastic. EP 1 340 668 A2 or EP 1 300 325 A2 provides the possibility of ribbing not only within the metal part for reinforcement but also outside of the same.<br>
It was quickly recognized that hollow-chamber lightweight components of hybrid design have excellent suitability wherever high stability, high energy absorption in the event of a crash, and weight saving are important, i.e. in the construction of motor vehicles, for example. E 0 679 565 Bl discloses the front-end of a motor vehicle with at least one rigid transverse bar which extends over most of the length of the front end, with at least one supporting part composed of plastic, cast onto the end region of the rigid transverse bar. EP 1 032 526 Bl discloses a load-bearing structure for the front module of a motor vehicle composed of a steel sheet parent body, of an unreinforced amorphous thermoplastic material, of a glass-fibre-reinforced thermoplastic, and also of a rib structure composed of, for example, polyamide. DE 100 53 840 A1 discloses a bumper system or energy-absorber element composed of oppositely arranged metal sheets and connection ribs composed of thermoplastic or of thermoset. WO 2001/40009 discloses the use of hybrid technology in brake pedals, clutch pedals or accelerator pedals of motor vehicles. EP 1 211 164 B1 in turn describes the support structure for a motor vehicle radiator arrangement, using a hybrid structure. DE 101 50 061 Al discloses the upper transverse member in the vehicle front module of hybrid design. US 6,688,680 Bl describes a transverse member of hybrid design in a vehicle. EP 1 380 493 A2 gives another example of a front end panel of a motor vehicle, but here the material is not injected around all of the metal part but takes the form of webs bracketing the same. Lightweight components of hybrid design can be used not only for front ends or pedals but also anywhere in the bodywork of a vehicle. By way of example, DE 100 18 186 B4 provides a solution for a vehicle door with door casing, EP 1 232 935 Al for the actual bodywork of a vehicle and DE 102 21 709 Al for the load-bearing elements of motor vehicles.<br>
High-flowability thermoplastic compositions are of interest for a wide variety of shaping processes, such as injection-moulding applications. By way of example, thin-wall components in<br><br>
the electrical, electronics and motor vehicle industries demand low viscosities of the thermoplastic composition, to permit filling of the mould while using minimum filling pressures or clamping forces for the corresponding injection-moulding machinery. This is also relevant to the simultaneous charging of a plurality of injection-moulded components by way of a shared gating system in what are known as multi-cavity moulds. Furthermore, low-viscosity thermoplastic compositions can also often achieve shorter cycle times. Good flowabilities are also moreover specifically very important in the case of highly filled thermoplastic compositions, for example those whose glass fibre contents and/or mineral contents are above 40% by weight.<br>
However, despite high flowability of the thermoplastic compositions, stringent mechanical requirements are placed upon the components themselves to be produced therefrom and in particular on hybrid components to be produced therefrom, and the lowering of viscosity cannot therefore be permitted to cause any impairment of mechanical properties.<br>
There are a number of ways of obtaining high-flowability, low-viscosity thermoplastic moulding compositions.<br>
One possibility is the use of low-viscosity polymer resins with low molecular weight as main polymers for the thermoplastic moulding compositions. However, the use of low-molecular-weight polymer resins is often attended by sacrifices in terms of mechanical properties, in particular toughness. Another factor is that the production of a low-viscosity polymer resin on an existing polymerization plant often requires complicated modification work attended by capital expenditure.<br>
Another possibility is the use of what are known as flow aids or internal lubricants, which are an additive that can be added to the polymer resin.<br>
These flow aids are known from the literature, e.g. Kunststoffe 2000, 9, pp. 116-118, and can by way of example be fatty acid esters of polyols, or can be amides derived from fatty acids or from amines. However, these fatty acid esters, for example pentaerythritol tetrastearate or ethylene glycol dimontanoate, have only limiting miscibility with polar thermoplastics, such as polyamides, polyalkylene terephthalates or polycarbonates. Their concentration therefore increases at the surface of the moulding, and for this reason they are also used as mould-release agents. However, particularly when relatively high concentrations are used, or on heat-ageing or in the case of polyamides also on absorption of moisture, they can migrate to the surface of these mouldings, where their concentration increases. By way of example, this can lead to problems in relation to paint adhesion or metal adhesion in coated mouldings.<br>
As an alternative to these surfactant flow aids, internal flow aids can be used, these being<br><br>
compatible with the polymer resins. Examples of materials suitable for this purpose are low-molecular-weight compounds or branched, highly branched or dendritic polymers, with polarity similar to that of the polymer resin. These highly branched or dendritic systems are known from the literature, and can by way of example be based on branched polyesters, polyamides, polyesteramides, polyethers or polyamines, as described in Kunststqffe 2001, 91, pp. 179-190, or in Advances in Polymer Science 1999, 143 (Branched Polymers II), pp. 1-34.<br>
In principle, the flowability of polyamides can be improved via addition of highly branched polymers having rigid aromatic units, via addition of polymers based on aromatics or via addition of phenols, bisphenols and similar low-molecular-weight additives.<br>
If, however, the intention is to influence not only the flowability of the moulding compositions but at the same time the modulus of elasticity and thus the stiffness of mouldings, in particular for use in hybrid components, the flow improvers of the prior art rapidly reach their limits. Nor is the desired result achieved here by using other copolymers based on ethene and on acrylates or methacrylates, in the thermoplastics to be used.<br>
The object of the present invention consisted in producing hollow-chamber lightweight components of hybrid design which firstly have the advantages knowTi from the prior art, such as high buckling resistance, high torsional stability, and relatively high strength, but which moreover feature relatively low weight and relatively low mould temperatures during production, where the viscosity of the polycondensate compositions is lowered via use of additives in the polymer melt, without any need here to accept the sort of losses in properties such as impact resistance and hydrolysis resistance that occur when low-viscosity linear polymer resins or additives known from the literature are used. In terms of stiffness and ultimate tensile strength, the intention was that ideally there be no significant difference from the polycondensate compositions not using additives, thus permitting problem-free replacement of the materials for plastics designs based on, for example, polyamide, and thus providing optimized use in hybrid components.<br>
The object is achieved in that the present invention provides lightweight components composed of a shell-type parent body whose external and/or internal space has reinforcing structures securely connected to the parent body and composed of moulded-on thermoplastics, and having connection to the parent body at discrete connection sites, characterized in that polymer moulding compositions are used comprising<br>
A)	from 99.99 to 10 parts by weight, preferably from 99.5 to 40 parts by weight,<br>
particularly preferably<br>
from 99.0 to 55 parts by weight, of at least one semicrystalline thermoplastic<br><br>
polymer and<br>
B)	from 0.01 to 50 parts by weight, preferably from 0.25 to 20 parts by weight,<br>
particularly preferably from 1.0 to 15 parts by weight<br>
Bl) of at least one copolymer composed of at least one olefin, preferably one a-olefm, with at least one methacrylate or acrylate of an aliphatic alcohol, preferably of an aliphatic alcohol having from 1 to 30 carbon atoms, where the MFl of the copolymer Bl) is not less than l00g/l0min, preferably not less than 150 g/10 min, or<br>
B2) of at least one highly branched or hyperbranched polycarbonate with an OH number of from 1 to 600 mg KOH/g of polycarbonate (to DIN 53240, Part 2), or<br>
B3) of at least one highly branched or hyperbranched polyester of AxBy type, where x is at least 1.1 and y is at least 2.1, or<br>
a mixture of Bl) with B2) or of B2) with 33) or of Bl) with B3) or of Bl) with B2) and with B3), in each case with A).<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the connection of the moulded-on thermoplastic to the parent body takes place at discrete connection sites by way of perforations in the parent body, where the plastic (thermoplastic) extends through these and extends over the area of the perforations, thus achieving a secure interlock bond. According to the invention, this procedure can be realized in one, two, three or more steps. The shell-type parent body preferably has a U shape, but can also have another shape in the case of motor vehicle doors. The design of the shell-type parent body is however in essence determined via the shape of the moulding to be produced. It is preferable to use a shell-type parent body composed of metal, particularly preferably of iron, steel, brass, aluminium, magnesium or titanium. However, the shell-type parent body itself can also be composed of a thermoplastic, and the thermoplastics used here can be the same as those described for component A) in the present application.<br>
The processing of the polymer moulding compositions to give the inventive lightweight components of hybrid design takes place via shaping processes for thermoplastics, preferably via injection moulding, melt extrusion, compression moulding, stamping or blow moulding. In principle, the advantageous effects to be achieved are apparent with thermoplastics of any type. A list of the thermoplastics to be used as component A) is found by way of example in Kunststoff-Taschenbuch [Plastics Handbook] (Ed. Saechtling), 1989 edition, which also mentions sources. Processes for the production of these thermoplastics are known per se to the person skilled in the<br><br>
art. The effects to be achieved are likewise apparent in all of the variations disclosed in the prior art cited above of the use of hybrid technology, irrespective of whether the plastics part encapsulates the metal part completely or, as in the case of EP 1 380 493 A2, merely forms a web around it, and irrespective of whether the plastics part is subsequently incorporated by adhesion or connected by way of example by a laser to the metal part, or whether, as in WO 2004/071741, the plastics part and the metal part obtain the secure interlock bond in an additional operation.<br>
Preferred semicrystalline thermoplastic polymers (thermoplastics) to be used as component A) for the inventive lightweight components in hybrid technology are those selected from the group of the polyamides, vinylaromatic polymers, ASA polymers, ABS polymers, SAN polymers, POM, PPE, polyarylene ether sulphones, polypropylene (PP) or their blends, preference being given here to polyamide, polyester, polypropylene and polycarbonates or blends comprising polyamide, polyester or polycarbonates as essential constituent.<br>
It is particularly preferable that the component A) used in the moulding compositions to be processed comprises at least one polymer from the series of polyester, polycarbonate, polypropylene or polyamide or blends of these thermoplastics with the abovementioned materials.<br>
Polyamides to be used with particular preference according to the invention as component A) are<br>
semicrystalline polyamides, which can be prepared starting from diamines and dicarboxylic acids<br>
and/or from lactams having at least five ring members, or from corresponding amino acids.<br>
Starting materials that can be used for this purpose are aliphatic and/or aromatic dicarboxylic<br>
acids, such as adipic acid, 2,2,4- and 2,4,4-trimethyladipic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid,<br>
isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, and aliphatic and/or aromatic diamines, e.g.<br>
tetramethylenediamine,	hexamethylenediamine,	1,9-nonanediamine,	2,2,4-	and<br>
2,4,4-trimethylhexamethylenediamine,	the	isomeric	diaminodicyclohexylmethanes,<br>
diaminodicyclohexylpropanes,	bisaminomethylcyclohexane,	phenylenediamines,<br>
xylylenediamines, aminocarboxylic acids, e.g. aminocaproic acid, and the corresponding lactams. Copolyamides composed of a plurality of the monomers mentioned are included.<br>
Polyamides preferred according to the invention are prepared from caprolactams, very particularly preferably from s-caprolactara, and also most of the compounding materials based on PA6, on PA66, and on other aliphatic and/or aromatic polyamides and, respectively, copolyamides, where there are from 3 to 11 methylene groups for every polyamide group in the polymer chain.<br>
Semicrystalline polyamides to be used according to the invention as component A) can also be used in a mixture with other polyamides and/or with further polymers.<br>
Conventional additives, e.g. mould-release agents, stabilizers and/or flow aids, can be admixed in<br><br>
the melt with the polyamides or applied to the surface.<br>
According to the invention, another particularly preferred component A) to be used is polyesters, these being polyesters based on aromatic dicarboxylic acids and on an aliphatic or aromatic dihydroxy compound.<br>
A first group of preferred polyesters is that of polyalkylene terephthalates, in particular those having from 2 to 10 carbon atoms in the alcohol moiety.<br>
Polyalkylene terephthalates of this type are known and are described in the literature. Their main chain comprises an aromatic ring which derives from the aromatic dicarboxylic acid. There may also be substitution in the aromatic ring, e.g. by halogen, such as chlorine or bromine, or by C1-C4-alkyl groups, such as methyl, ethyl, iso- or n-propyl, or n-, iso- or tert-butyl groups.<br>
These polyalkylene terephthalates may be prepared by reacting aromatic dicarboxylic acids, or their esters or other ester-forming derivatives, with aliphatic dihydroxy compounds in a known manner.<br>
Preferred dicarboxylic acids that may be mentioned are 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid, and mixtures of these. Up to 30 mol%, preferably not more than 10 mol%, of the aromatic dicarboxylic acids may be replaced by aliphatic or cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acids, such as adipic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, dodecanedioic acids and cyclohexanedicarboxylic acids.<br>
Among the aliphatic di-hydroxy compounds, preference is given to diols having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms, in particular 1,2-ethanediol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, 1,4-hexane-diol, 1,4-cyclohexanediol, 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol and neopentyl glycol, and mixtures of these.<br>
Polyesters of component A) whose use is very particularly preferred are polyalkylene terephthalates derived from alkanediols having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms. Among these, particular preference is given to polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene terephthalate and polybutylene terephthalate, and mixtures of these. Preference is also given to PET and/or PBT which comprise, as other monomer units, up to 1% by weight, preferably up to 0.75% by weight, of 1,6-hexanediol and/or 2-methyl-l,5-pentanediol.<br>
The viscosity number of polyesters whose use is preferred according to the invention as component A) is generally in the range from 50 to 220, preferably from 8 to 160 (measured in 0.5% strength by weight solution in a phenol/o-dichlorobenzene mixture in a ratio by weight of 1:1 at 25°C) in accordance with ISO 1628.<br><br>
Particular preference is given to polyesters whose carboxy end group content is up to 100 meq/kg of polyester, preferably up to 50 meq/kg of polyester and in particular up to 40 meq/kg of polyester. Polyesters of this type may be prepared, for example, by the process of DE-A 44 01 055. The carboxy end group content is usually determined by titration methods (e.g. potentiometry).<br>
If polyester mixtures are used as component A), the moulding compositions comprise a mixture composed of polyesters which differ from PBT, an example being polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The content by way of example of the polyethylene terephthalate is preferably up to 50% by weight in the mixture, in particular from 10 to 35% by weight, based on 100% by weight of A).<br>
It is also advantageous to use recycled materials, such as recycled PA materials or recycled PET materials (also termed scrap PET), if appropriate mixed with polyalkylene terephthalates, such as PBT.<br>
Recycled materials are generally:<br>
1)	those known as post-industrial recycled materials: these are production wastes during polycondensation or during processing, e.g. sprues from injection moulding, start-up material from injection moulding or extrusion, or edge trims from extruded sheets or foils.<br>
2)	post-consumer recycled materials: these are plastic items which are collected and treated after utilization by the end consumer. Blow-moulded PET bottles for mineral water, soft drinks and juices are easily the predominant items in terms of quantity.<br>
Both types of recycled material may be used either as ground material or in the form of pellets. In the latter case, the crude recycled materials are separated and purified and then melted and pelletized using an extruder. This usually facilitates handling and free flow, and metering for further steps in processing.<br>
The recycled materials used may be either pelletized or in the form of regrind. The edge length should not be more than 10 mm, preferably less than 8 mm.<br>
Because polyesters undergo hydrolytic cleavage during processing (due to traces of moisture) it is advisable to predry the recycled material. The residual moisture content after drying is preferably 
Another group that may be mentioned of polyesters whose use is preferred for component A) is that of fully aromatic polyesters derived from aromatic dicarboxylic acids and aromatic dihydroxy compounds.<br><br>
Suitable aromatic dicarboxylic acids are the compounds previously mentioned for the polyalkylene terephthalates. The mixtures preferably used are composed of from 5 to 100 mol% of isophthalic acid and from 0 to 95 mol% of terephthalic acid, in particular from about 50 to about 80% of terephthalic acid and from 20 to about 50% of isophthalic acid.<br>
The aromatic dihydroxy compounds preferably have the general formula<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where<br>
Z	is an alkylene or cycloalkylene group having up to 8 carbon atoms, an arylene group<br>
having up to 12 carbon atoms, a carbonyl group, a sulphonyl group, an oxygen or sulphur atom, or a chemical bond, and where<br>
m	is from 0 to 2.<br>
The phenylene groups of the compounds may also have substitution by C1-C6-alkyl or -alkoxy groups and fluorine, chlorine or bromine.<br>
Examples of parent compounds for these compounds are dihydroxybiphenyl, di(hydroxyphenyl)alkane, di(hydroxyphenyl)cycloalkane, di(hydroxyphenyl)sulphide, di(hydroxyphenyl) ether, di(hydroxyphenyl) ketone, di(hydroxyphenyl) sulphoxide, a,a'-di(hydroxyphenyl)dialkylbenzene, di(hydroxyphenyl) sulphone, di(hydroxybenzoyl)benzene, resorcinol, and hydroquinone, and also the ring-alkylated and ring-halogenated derivatives of these.<br>
Among these, preference is given to 4,4'-dihydroxybiphenyl, 2,4-di(4'-hydroxyphenyl)-2-methylbutane, α,α'-di(4-hydroxyphenyl)-p-diisopropylbenzene, 2,2-di(3 '-methyl-4'-hydroxyphenyl)propane, and 2,2-di(3'-chloro-4'-hydroxyphenyl)propane, and in particular to 2,2-di(4'-hydroxyphenyl)propane, 2,2-di(3',5-dichlorodihydroxyphenyl)propane, l,l-di(4'-hydroxyphenyl)cyclohexane, 3,4'-dihydroxybenzophenone, 4,4'-dihydroxydiphenyl sulphone and 2,2-di(3',5'-dimethyl-4'-hydroxyphenyl)propane and mixtures of these.<br>
It is, of course, also possible to use mixtures of polyalkylene terephthalates and fully aromatic polyesters. These generally comprise from 20 to 98%) by weight of the polyalkylene terephthalate and from 2 to 80% by weight of the fully aromatic polyester.<br><br>
It is, of course, also possible to use polyester block copolymers, such as copolyetheresters. Products of this type are known and are described in the literature, e.g. in US-A 3 651 014. Corresponding products are also available commercially, e.g. Hytrel® (DuPont).<br>
According to the invention, materials whose use is preferred as polyesters and therefore likewise as component A) also include halogen-free polycarbonates. Examples of suitable halogen-free polycarbonates are those based on diphenols of the general formula<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
where<br>
Q       is a single bond, a C1-C8-alkylene, C2-C3-alkylidene, C3-C6-cycloalkylidene, C6-C12-arylene group, or -0-, -S- or -SO2-, and m is a whole number from 0 to 2.<br>
The phenylene radicals of the diphenols may also have substituents, such as C1-C6-alkyl or C1-C6-alkoxy.<br>
Examples of preferred diphenols of the formula are hydroquinone, resorcinol, 4,4'-di-hydroxybiphenyl, 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-methylbutane and l,l-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)cyclohexane. Particular preference is given to 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane and l,l-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)cyclohexane, and also to l,l-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane.<br>
Either homopolycarbonates or copolycarbonates are suitable as component A, and preference is given to the copolycarbonates of bisphenol A, as well as to bisphenol A homopolymer.<br>
Suitable polycarbonates may be branched in a known manner, specifically and preferably by incorporating from 0.05 to 2.0 mol%, based on the total of the diphenols used, of at least trifunctional compounds, for example those having three or more phenolic OH groups.<br>
Polycarbonates which have proven particularly suitable have relative viscosities rel of from 1.10 to 1.50, in particular from 1.25 to 1.40. This corresponds to an average molar mass M^ (weight-average) of from 10 000 to 200 000 g/mol, preferably from 20 000 to 80 000 g/mol.<br>
The diphenols of the general formula are known or can be prepared by known processes.<br>
The polycarbonates may, for example, be prepared by reacting the diphenols with phosgene in the<br><br>
interfacial process, or with phosgene in the homogeneous-phase process (known as the pyridine process), and in each case the desired molecular weight may be achieved in a known manner by using an appropriate amount of known chain terminators. (In relation to polydiorganosiloxane-containing polycarbonates see, for example, DE-A 33 34 782.)<br>
Examples of suitable chain terminators are phenol, p-tert-butylphenol, or else long-chain alkylphenols, such as 4-(l,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenol as in DE-A 28 42 005, or monoalkylphenols, or dialkylphenols with a total of from 8 to 20 carbon atoms in the alkyl substituents as in DE-A-35 06 472, such as p-nonylphenol, 3,5-di-tert-butylphenol, p-tert-octylphenol, p-dodecylphenol, 2-(3,5-dimethylheptyl)phenol and 4-(3,5-dimethylheptyl)phenol.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, halogen-free polycarbonates are polycarbonates composed of halogen-free diphenols, of halogen-free chain terminators and, if used, halogen-free branching agents, where the content of subordinate amounts at the ppm level of hydrolyzable chlorine, resulting, for example, from the preparation of the polycarbonates with phosgene in the interfacial process, is not regarded as meriting the term halogen-containing for the purposes of the invention. Polycarbonates of this type with contents of hydrolyzable chlorine at the ppm level are halogen-free polycarbonates for the purposes of the present invention.<br>
Other suitable components A) that may be mentioned are amorphous polyester carbonates, where during the preparation process phosgene has been replaced by aromatic dicarboxylic acid units, such as isophthalic acid and/or terephthalic acid units. Reference may be made at this point to EP-A 711 810 for further details.<br>
EP-A 365 916 describes other suitable copolycarbonates having cycloalkyl radicals as monomer units.<br>
It is also possible for bisphenol A to be replaced by bisphenol TMC. Polycarbonates of this type are obtainable from Bayer AG with the trademark APEC HT®.<br>
However, preference is given according to the invention to the use of the polyamides or polyesters described above as component A).<br>
The moulding compositions to be used according to the invention can comprise, as component B), Bl) copolymers, preferably random copolymers composed of at least one olefin, preferably a-olefin, and of at least one methaciylate or acrylate of an aliphatic alcohol, where the MFI of the copolymer B) is not less than 100 g/10 min, preferably 150 g/10 min, particularly preferably 300 g/10 min. In one preferred embodiment, the copolymer Bl) is composed of less than 4% by weight, particularly preferably less than 1.5% by weight and very particularly preferably 0% by<br><br>
weight, of monomer units which contain further reactive functional groups selected from the group comprising epoxides, oxetanes, anhydrides, imides, aziridines, furans, acids, amines, oxazolines.<br>
Olefins, preferably a-olefins, suitable as constituent of the copolymers Bl) preferably have from 2 to 10 carbon atoms and can be unsubstituted or can have substitution by one or more aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic groups.<br>
Preferred olefins are those selected from the group consisting of ethene, propene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 3-methyl-l-pentene. Particularly preferred olefins are ethene and propene, and ethene is particularly preferred.<br>
Mixtures of the olefins described are also suitable.<br>
In an embodiment to which fiirther preference is given, the further reactive functional groups of the copolymer Bl), selected from the group consisting of epoxides, oxetanes, anhydrides, imides, aziridines, furans, acids, amines, oxazolines, are introduced exclusively by way of the olefins into the copolymer Bl).<br>
The content of the olefin in the copolymer Bl) is from 50 to 90% by weight, preferably from 55 to 75% by weight.<br>
The copolymer Bl) is further defined via the second constituent alongside the olefin. A suitable second constituent is alkyl esters or arylalkyl esters of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid whose alkyl or arylalkyl group is formed from 1 to 30 carbon atoms. The alkyl or arylalkyl group here can be linear or branched, and also can contain cycloaliphatic or aromatic groups, and alongside this can also have substitution by one or more ether or thioether functions. Other suitable methacrylates or acrylates in this connection are those synthesized from an alcohol component based on oligoethylene glycol or on oligopropylene glycol having only one hydroxy group and at most 30 carbon atoms.<br>
By way of example, the alkyl group or arylalkyl group of the methacrylate or acrylate can have been selected from the group consisting of methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, sec-butyl, 1-pentyl, 1-hexyl, 2-hexyl, 3-hexyl, 1-heptyl, 3-heptyl, 1-octyl, l-(2-ethyl)hexyl, 1-nonyl, 1-decyl, 1-dodecyl, 1-lauryl or 1-octadecyl. Preference is given to alkyl groups or arylalkyl groups having from 6 to 20 carbon atoms. Preference is particularly also given to branched alkyl groups which have the same number of carbon atoms as linear alkyl groups but give a lower glass transition temperature TQ.<br><br>
Particular preference according to the invention is given to copolymers Bl) in which the olefin is copolymerized with 2-ethylhexyl acrylate. Mixtures of the acrylates or methacylates described are also suitable.<br>
It is preferable here to use more than 60% by weight, particularly preferably more than 90% by weight and very particularly preferably 100%) by weight, of 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, based on the total amount of acrylate and methacrylate in copolymer B1).<br>
In an embodiment to which further preference is given, the further reactive functional groups selected from the group consisting of epoxides, oxetanes, anhydrides, imides, aziridines, furans, acids, amines, oxazolines in the copolymer Bl) are introduced exclusively by way of the acrylate or methacrylate into the copolymer Bl).<br>
The content of the acrylate or methacrylate in the copolymer Bl) is from 10 to 50% by weight, preferably from 25 to 45%) by weight.<br>
Another feature of suitable copolymers B1), alongside their constitution, is low molecular weight. Accordingly, copolymers Bl) suitable for the inventive moulding compositions are only those whose MFI value (Melt Flow Index) measured at 190°C and with a load of 2.16 kg is at least 100 g/10 min, preferably at least 150 g/10 min, particularly preferably at least 300 g/10 min.<br>
By way of example, copolymers suitable as component Bl) can be those selected from the group of materials supplied by Atofina with the trade mark Lotryl® EH, these usually being used as hot-melt adhesives.<br>
The inventive moulding compositions can comprise, as component B) and as alternative to Bl), from 0.01 to 50%) by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 20%) by weight and in particular from 0.7 to 10% by weight, of B2) at least one highly branched or hyperbranched polycarbonate with an OH number of from 1 to 600 mg KOH/g of polycarbonate, preferably from 10 to 550 mg KOH/g of polycarbonate and in particular from 50 to 550 mg KOH/g of polycarbonate (to DIN 53240, Part 2) or of at least one hyperbranched polyester as component B3) or a mixture of Bl) with B2) or of B2) with B3) or of Bl) with B3) or a mixture of Bl) with B2) and with B3).<br>
For the purposes of this invention, hyperbranched polycarbonates B2) are non-crosslinked macromolecules having hydroxy groups and carbonate groups, these having both structural and molecular non-uniformity. Their structure may firstly be based on a central molecule in the same way as dendrimers, but with non-uniform chain length of the branches. Secondly, they may also have a linear structure with functional pendant groups, or else they may combine the two extremes, having linear and branched molecular portions. See also P.J. Flory, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1952, 74,<br><br>
2718, and H. Frey et al., Chem. Eur. J. 2000, 6, no. 14, 2499 for the definition of dendrimeric and hyperbranched polymers.<br>
"Hyperbranched" in the context of the present invention means that the degree of branching (DB), i.e. the average number of dendritic linkages plus the average number of end groups per molecule, is from 10 to 99.9%, preferably from 20 to 99%, particularly preferably from 20 to 95%.<br>
"Dendrimeric" in the context of the present invention means that the degree of branching is from 99.9 to 100%. See H. Frey et al.. Acta Polym. 1997, 48, 30 for the definition of "degree of branching".<br>
Component B2) preferably has a number-average molar mass Mn of from 100 to 15 000 g/mol, preferably from 200 to 12 000 g/mol, and in particular from 500 to 10 000 g/mol (GPC, PMMA standard).<br>
The glass transition temperature Tg is in particular from -80 to +140°C, preferably from -60 to 120°C (according to DSC, DIN 53765).<br>
In particular, the viscosity (mPas) at 23°C (to DIN 53019) is from 50 to 200 000, in particular from 100 to 150 000, and very particularly preferably from 200 to 100 000.<br>
Component B2) is preferably obtainable via a process which comprises at least the following steps:<br>
a)	reaction of at least one organic carbonate (A) of the general formula RO[(CO)]nOR with at<br>
least one aliphatic, aliphatic/aromatic or aromatic alcohol (B) which has at least 3 OH<br>
groups, with elimination of alcohols ROH to give one or more condensates (K), where<br>
each R, independently of the others, is a straight-chain or branched aliphatic,<br>
aromatic/aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and<br>
where the radicals R may also have bonding to one another to form a ring, and n is a whole<br>
number from 1 to 5, or<br>
ab)        reaction of phosgene, diphosgene, or triphosgene with alcohol (B) mentioned under a), with elimination of hydrogen chloride<br>
b)	intermolecular reaction of the condensates (K) to give a highly functional, highly<br>
branched, or highly functional, hyperbranched polycarbonate, where the quantitative<br>
proportion of the OH groups to the carbonates in the reaction mixture is selected in such a<br>
way that the condensates (K) have an average of either one carbonate group and more than<br>
one OH group or one OH group and more than one carbonate group.<br><br>
Phosgene, diphosgene, or triphosgene may be used as starting material, but preference is given to organic carbonates.<br>
Each of the radicals R of the organic carbonates (A) used as starting material and having the general formula RO(CO)OR is, independently of the others, a straight-chain or branched aliphatic, aromatic/aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. The two radicals R may also have bonding to one another to form a ring. The radical is preferably an aliphatic hydrocarbon radical, and particularly preferably a straight-chain or branched alkyl radical having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms, or a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl radical.<br>
In particular, use is made of simple carbonates of the formula RO(CO)OR; n is preferably from 1 to 3, in particular 1.<br>
By way of example, dialkyl or diaryl carbonates may be prepared from the reaction of aliphatic, araliphatic, or aromatic alcohols, preferably monoalcohols, with phosgene. They may also be prepared by way of oxidative carbonylation of the alcohols or phenols by means of CO in the presence of noble metals, oxygen, or NOx. In relation to preparation methods for diaryl or dialkyl carbonates, see also "Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry", 6th edition, 2000 Electronic Release, Verlag Wiley-VCH.<br>
Examples of suitable carbonates comprise aliphatic, aromatic/aliphatic or aromatic carbonates, such as ethylene carbonate, propylene 1,2- or 1,3-carbonate, diphenyl carbonate, ditolyl carbonate, dixylyl carbonate, dinaphthyl carbonate, ethyl phenyl carbonate, dibenzyl carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, diethyl carbonate, dipropyl carbonate, dibutyl carbonate, diisobutyl carbonate, dipentyl carbonate, dihexyl carbonate, dicyclohexyl carbonate, diheptyl carbonate, dioctyl carbonate, didecyl carbonate, or didodecyl carbonate.<br>
Examples of carbonates where n is greater than 1 comprise dialkyl dicarbonates, such as di(tert-butyl) dicarbonate, or dialkyl tricarbonates, such as di(tert-butyl) tricarbonate.<br>
It is preferable to use aliphatic carbonates, in particular those in which the radicals comprise from 1 to 5 carbon atoms, e.g. dimethyl carbonate, diethyl carbonate, dipropyl carbonate, dibutyl carbonate, or diisobutyl carbonate.<br>
The organic carbonates are reacted with at least one aliphatic alcohol (B) which has at least 3 OH groups, or with mixtures of two or more different alcohols.<br>
Examples of compounds having at least three OH groups comprise glycerol, trimethylolmethane,<br>
trimethylolethane,	trimethylolpropane,	1,2,4-butanetriol,	tris(hydroxymethyl)amine,<br>
tris(hydroxyethyl)amine,    tris(hydroxypropyl)amine,    pentaerythritol,    diglycerol,    triglycerol.<br><br>
polyglycerols, bis(trimethylolpropane), tris(hydroxymethyl) isocyanurate, tris(hydroxyethy!) isocyanurate, phloroglucinol, trihydroxytoluene, trihydroxydimethylbenzene, phloroglucides, hexahydroxybenzene, 1,3,5-benzenetrimethanol, l,l,l-tris(4'-hydroxyphenyl)methane, 1,1,1-tris(4'-hydroxyphenyl)ethane, or sugars, e.g. glucose, trihydric or higher polyhydric polyetherols based on trihydric or higher polyhydric alcohols and ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, or butylene oxide, or polyesterols. Particular preference is given here to glycerol, trimethylolethane, trimethylolpropane, 1,2,4-butanetriol, pentaerythritol, and also their polyetherols based on ethylene oxide or propylene oxide.<br>
These polyhydric alcohols may also be used in a mixture with dihydric alcohols (B'), with the<br>
proviso that the average total OH functionality of all of the alcohols used is greater than 2.<br>
Examples of suitable compounds having two OH groups comprise ethylene glycol, diethylene<br>
glycol, triethylene glycol, 1,2- and 1,3-propanediol, dipropylene glycol, tripropylene glycol,<br>
neopentyl glycol, 1,2-, 1,3-, and 1,4-butanediol, 1,2-, 1,3-, and 1,5-pentanediol, hexanediol,<br>
cyclopentanediol, cyclohexanediol, cyclohexanedimethanol, bis(4-hydroxycyclohexyl)methane,<br>
bis(4-hydroxycyclohexyl)ethane,	2,2-bis(4-hydroxycyclohexyl)propane,	1,1 '-bis(4-<br>
hydroxyphenyl)-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane, resorcinol, hydroquinone, 4,4'-dihydroxyphenyl, bis(4-bis(hydroxyphenyl) sulphide, bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) sulphone, bis(hydroxymethyl)benzene, bis(hydroxymethyi)toluene, bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)methane, bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)ethane, 2,2-bis(hydroxyphenyl)propane, 1,1 -bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)cyclohexane, dihydroxybenzophenone, dihydric polyether polyols based on ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide, or mixtures of these, polytetrahydrofuran, polycaprolactone, or polyesterols based on diols and dicarboxylic acids.<br>
The diols serve for fine adjustment of the properties of the polycarbonate. If use is made of dihydric alcohols, the ratio of dihydric alcohols B'), to the at least trihydric alcohols (B) is set by the person skilled in the art and depends on the desired properties of the polycarbonate. The amount of the alcohol(s) (B') is generally from 0 to 39.9 mol%, based on the total amount of all of the alcohols (B) and (B') taken together. The amount is preferably from 0 to 35 mol%, particularly preferably from 0 to 25 mol%, and very particularly preferably from 0 to 10 mol%.<br>
The reaction of phosgene, diphosgene, or triphosgene with the alcohol or alcohol mixture generally takes place with elimination of hydrogen chloride, and the reaction of the carbonates with the alcohol or alcohol mixture to give the highly functional highly branched polycarbonate takes place with elimination of the monofunctional alcohol or phenol from the carbonate molecule.<br>
The highly functional highly branched polycarbonates have termination by hydroxy groups and/or by carbonate groups after their preparation, i.e. with no further modification. They have good<br><br>
solubility in various solvents, e.g. in water, alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, butanol,<br>
alcohol/water mixtures, acetone, 2-butanone, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, methoxypropyl acetate,<br>
methoxyethyl	acetate,	tetrahydrofuran,	dimethylformamide,	dimethylacetamide,<br>
N-methylpyrrolidone, ethylene carbonate, or propylene carbonate.<br>
For the purposes of this invention, a highly functional polycarbonate is a product which, besides the carbonate groups which form the polymer skeleton, further has at least three, preferably at least six, more preferably at least ten, terminal or pendant functional groups. The functional groups are carbonate groups and/or OH groups. There is in principle no upper restriction on the number of the terminal or pendant functional groups, but products having a very high number of functional groups can have undesired properties, such as high viscosity or poor solubility. The highly functional polycarbonates of the present invention mostly have not more than 500 terminal or pendant functional groups, preferably not more than 100 terminal or pendant functional groups.<br>
When preparing the highly functional polycarbonates B2), it is necessary to adjust the ratio of the compounds comprising OH groups to phosgene or carbonate in such a way that the simplest resultant condensate (hereinafter termed condensate (K)) comprises an average of either one carbonate group or carbamoyl group and more than one OH group or one OH group and more than one carbonate group or carbamoyl group. The simplest structure of the condensate (K) composed of a carbonate (A) and a di- or polyalcohol (B) here results in the arrangement XYn or YnX, where X is a carbonate group, Y is a hydroxy group, and n is generally a number from 1 to 6, preferably from 1 to 4, particularly preferably from 1 to 3. The reactive group which is the single resultant group here is generally termed "focal group" below.By way of example, if during the preparation of the simplest condensate (K) from a carbonate and a dihydric alcohol the reaction ratio is 1:1, the average result is a molecule of XY type, illustrated by the general formula <br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
During the preparation of the condensate (K) from a carbonate and a trihydric alcohol with a reaction ratio of 1:1, the average result is a molecule of XY2 type, illustrated by the general formula II. A carbonate group is focal group here.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
During the preparation of the condensate (K) from a carbonate and a tetrahydric alcohol, likewise with the reaction ratio 1:1, the average result is a molecule of XY3 type, illustrated by the general formula III. A carbonate group is focal group here.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
R in the formulae (I) to (III) has the definition given above, and R' is an aliphatic or aromatic radical.<br>
The condensate (K) may, by way of example, also be prepared from a carbonate and a trihydric alcohol, as illustrated by the general formula (IV), the molar reaction ratio being 2:1. Here, the average result is a molecule of X2Y type, an OH group being focal group here. In formula (IV), R and R' are as defined in formulae (I) to (III).<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
If difunctional compounds, e.g. a dicarbonate or a diol, are also added to the components, this extends the chains, as illustrated by way of example in the general formula (V). The average result is again a molecule of XY2 type, a carbonate group being focal group.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
In formula (V), R2 is an organic, preferably aliphatic radical, and R and R are as defined above.<br>
It is also possible to use two or more condensates (K) for the synthesis. Here, firstly two or more alcohols or two or more carbonates may be used. Furthermore, mixtures of various condensates of different structure can be obtained via the selection of the ratio of the alcohols used and of the carbonates or the phosgenes. This may be illustrated taking the example of the reaction of a carbonate with a trihydric alcohol. If the starting products are reacted in a ratio of 1:1, as shown in (II), the result is an XY2 molecule. If the starting products are reacted in a ratio of 2:1, as shown in (IV), the result is an X2Y molecule. If the ratio is from 1:1 to 2:1, the result is a mixture of XY2 and X2Y molecules.<br>
According to the invention, the simple condensates (K) described by way of example in the formulae (I) to (V) preferentially react intermolecularly to form highly ftinctional polycondensates, hereinafter termed polycondensates (P). The reaction to give the condensate (K) and to give the polycondensate (P) usually takes place at a temperature of from 0 to 250°C, preferably from 60 to 160°C, in bulk or in solution.<br>
Use may generally be made here of any of the solvents which are inert with respect to the respective starting materials. Preference is given to use of organic solvents, e.g. decane, dodecane, benzene, toluene, chlorobenzene, xylene, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, or solvent naphtha.<br>
In one embodiment, the condensation reaction is carried out in bulk. To accelerate the reaction, the phenol or the monohydric alcohol ROH liberated during the reaction can be removed by distillation from the reaction equilibrium if appropriate at reduced pressure.<br>
If removal by distillation is intended, it is generally advisable to use those carbonates which liberate alcohols ROH with a boiling point below 140°C during the reaction.<br>
Catalysts or catalyst mixtures may also be added to accelerate the reaction. Suitable catalysts are compounds which catalyze esterification or transesterification reactions, e.g. alkali metal hydroxides, alkali metal carbonates, alkali metal hydrogencarbonates, preferably of sodium, of potassium, or of cesium, tertiary amines, guanidines, ammonium compounds, phosphonium compounds, organoaluminium, organotin, organozinc, organotitanium, organozirconium, or organobismuth compounds, or else what are known as double metal cyanide (DMC) catalysts, e.g. as described in DE-A 10138216 or DE-A 10147712.<br>
It is preferable to use potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, potassium hydrogencarbonate, diazabicyclooctane    (DABCO),    diazabicyclononene    (DBN),    diazabicycloundecene    (DBU),<br><br>
imidazoles, such as imidazole, 1-methylimidazole, or 1,2-dimethylimidazole, titanium tetrabutoxide, titanium tetraisopropoxide, dibutyltin oxide, dibutyltin dilaurate, stannous dioctoate, zirconium acetylacetonate, or mixtures thereof<br>
The amount of catalyst generally added is from 50 to 10 000 ppm by weight, preferably from 100 to 5000 ppm by weight, based on the amount of the alcohol mixture or alcohol used.<br>
It is also possible to control the intermolecular polycondensation reaction via addition of the suitable catalyst or else via selection of a suitable temperature. The average molecular weight of the polymer (P) may moreover be adjusted by way of the composition of the starting components and by way of the residence time.<br>
The condensates (K) and the polycondensates (P) prepared at an elevated temperature are usually stable at room temperature for a relatively long period.<br>
The nature of the condensates (K) permits polycondensates (P) with different structures to result from the condensation reaction, these having branching but no crosslinking. Furthermore, in the ideal case, the polycondensates (P) have either one carbonate group as focal group and more than two OH groups or else one OH group as focal group and more than two carbonate groups. The number of the reactive groups here is the result of the nature of the condensates (K) used and the degree of polycondensation.<br>
By way of example, a condensate (K) according to the general formula (H) can react via triple intermolecular condensation to give two different polycondensates (P), represented in the general formulae (VI) and (VII).<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
In formula (VI) and (VII), R and R' are as defined above.<br>
There are various ways of terminating the intermolecular polycondensation reaction. By way of example, the temperature may be lowered to a range where the reaction stops and the product (K) or the polycondensate (P) is storage-stable.<br>
It is also possible to deactivate the catalyst, for example in the case of basic catalysts via addition of Lewis acids or proton acids.<br>
In another embodiment, as soon as the intermolecular reaction of the condensate (K) has produced a polycondensate (P) with the desired degree of polycondensation, a product having groups reactive toward the focal group of (P) may be added to the product (P) to terminate the reaction. In the case of a carbonate group as focal group, by way of example, a mono-, di-, or polyamine may therefore be added. In the case of a hydroxy group as focal group, by way of example, a mono-, di-, or polyisocyanate, or a compound comprising epoxy groups, or an acid derivative which reacts with OH groups, can be added to the product (P).<br>
The highly functional polycarbonates are mostly prepared in a pressure range from 0.1 mbar to 20 bar, preferably at from 1 mbar to 5 bar, in reactors or reactor cascades which are operated batchwise, semicontinuously, or continuously.<br>
The inventive products can be further processed without further purification after their preparation by virtue of the abovementioned adjustment of the reaction conditions and, if appropriate, by virtue of the selection of the suitable solvent.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the product is stripped, i.e. freed from low-molecular-weight.<br><br>
volatile compounds. For this, once the desired degree of conversion has been reached the catalyst may optionally be deactivated and the low-molecular-weight volatile constituents, e.g. monoalcohols, phenols, carbonates, hydrogen chloride, or volatile oligomeric or cyclic compounds, can be removed by distillation, if appropriate with introduction of a gas, preferably nitrogen, carbon dioxide, or air, if appropriate at reduced pressure.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the polycarbonates may comprise other fiinctional groups besides the functional groups present at this stage by virtue of the reaction. The fiinctionalization may take place during the process to increase molecular weight, or else subsequently, i.e. after completion of the actual polycondensation.<br>
If, prior to or during the process to increase molecular weight, components are added which have other functional groups or functional elements besides hydroxy or carbonate groups, the result is a polycarbonate polymer with randomly distributed functionalities other than the carbonate or hydroxy groups.<br>
Effects of this type can, by way of example, be achieved via addition, during the polycondensation, of compounds which bear other functional groups or functional elements, such as mercapto groups, primary, secondary or tertiary amino groups, ether groups, derivatives of carboxylic acids, derivatives of sulphonic acids, derivatives of phosphonic acids, silane groups, siloxane groups, aryl radicals, or long-chain alkyl radicals, besides hydroxy groups, carbonate groups or carbamoyl groups. Examples of compounds which may be used for modification by means of carbamate groups are ethanolamine, propanolamine, isopropanolamine, 2-(butylamino)ethanol, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanol, 2-amino-1-butanol, 2-(2'-aminoethoxy)ethanol or higher alkoxylation products of ammonia, 4-hydroxypiperidine, 1-hydroxyethylpiperazine, diethanolamine, dipropanolamine, diisopropanolamine, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, tris(hydroxy-ethyl)aminomethane, ethylenediamine, propylenediamine, hexamethylenediamine or isophoronediamine.<br>
An example of a compound which can be used for modification with mercapto groups is mercaptoethanol. By way of example, tertiary amino groups can be produced via incorporation of N-methyldiethanolamine, N-methyldipropanolamine or N,N-dimethylethanolamine. By way of example, ether groups may be generated via co-condensation of dihydric or higher polyhydric polyetherols. Long-chain alkyl radicals can be introduced via reaction with long-chain alkanediols, and reaction with alkyl or aryl diisocyanates generates polycarbonates having alkyl, aryl, and urethane groups, or urea groups.<br>
Ester groups can be produced via addition of dicarboxylic acids, tricarboxylic acids, or, for<br>
example, dimethyl terephthalate, or tricarboxylic esters.<br>
Subsequent functionalization can be achieved by using an additional step of the process to react the resultant highly functional, highly branched, or highly functional hyperbranched polycarbonate with a suitable functionalizing reagent which can react with the OH and/or carbonate groups or carbamoyl groups of the polycarbonate.<br>
By way of example, highly functional highly branched, or highly functional hyperbranched polycarbonates comprising hydroxy groups can be modified via addition of molecules comprising acid groups or isocyanate groups. By way of example, polycarbonates comprising acid groups can be obtained via reaction with compounds comprising anhydride groups.<br>
Highly functional polycarbonates comprising hydroxy groups may moreover also be converted into highly functional polycarbonate polyether polyols via reaction with alkylene oxides, e.g. ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, or butylene oxide.<br>
The moulding compositions to be used for the production of the inventive hybrid-based lightweight components can comprise, as component B3), at least one hyperbranched polyester of AxBy type, where<br>
X	is at least 1.1, preferably at least 1.3, in particular at least 2 and<br>
y	is at least 2.1, preferably at least 2.5, in particular at least 3.<br>
Use may also be made of mixtures as units A and/or B, of course.<br>
An AxBy-type polyester is a condensate composed of an x-functional molecule A and a y-functional molecule B. By way of example, mention may be made of a polyester composed of adipic acid as molecule A (x = 2) and glycerol as molecule B (y = 3).<br>
For the purposes of this invention, hyperbranched polyesters B3) are non-crosslinked macromolecules having hydroxy groups and carboxy groups, these having both structural and molecular non-uniformity. Their structure may firstly be based on a central molecule in the same way as dendrimers, but with non-uniform chain length of the branches. Secondly, they may also have a linear structure with fimctional pendant groups, or else they may combine the two extremes, having linear and branched molecular portions. See also P.J. Flory, J. Am.

One or, if αppropriαte, more chemicαl initiαtors αre αdded to this solution. Exαmples of suitαble initiαtors αre peroxides. The mixture is then polymerized αt elevαted temperαtures for α number of hours. The solvent αnd the unreαcted monomers αre then removed in<br>
α mαnner known per se.<br>
The rαtio of component G.l (vinylαromαtic monomer) to component G.2, e.g. the αcrylonitrile monomer in the terpolymer is preferαbly from 80:20 to 50:50.<br>
Styrene is pαrticulαrly preferred αs vinylαromαtic monomer G.l. αcrylonitrile is pαrticulαrly preferαbly suitαble for component G.2. Mαleic αnhydride is pαrticulαrly preferαbly suitαble αs component G.3.<br>

The compαtibilizers cαn be present in component G) αlone or in αny desired mixture with one αnother.<br>
αnother substαnce pαrticulαrly preferred αs compαtibilizer is α terpolymer of styrene αnd αcyrlonitrile in α rαtio of 2.1:1 by weight contαining 1 mol% of mαleic αnhydride.<br>
Component G) is used pαrticulαrly when the moulding composition comprises grαft polymers, αs described under E).<br>
αccording to the invention, the following combinαtions of the components αre preferred in polymer moulding compositions for use in hybrid-bαsed lightweight components:<br>
α,B; α,B,C; α,B,D; α,B,E; α,B,F; α,B,G; α,B,C,D; α,B,C,E; α,B,C,F; α,B,C,G; α,B,D,E; α,B,D,F; α,B,D,G; α,B,E,F; α,B,E,G; α,B,F,G; α,B,C,D,E; α,B,C,D,G; α,B,C,F,G; α,B,E,F,G; α,B,D,F,G; α,B,C,D,E,F; α,B,C,D,E,G; α,B,D,E,F,G; α,B,C,E,F,G;   α,B,C,D,E,G; α,B,C,D,E,F,G.<br>

front ends, α stαndαrd αpplicαtion of hybrid technology, cαn thus be designed to be lighter αnd or more rigid, αnd this is αttended by α reduction of 30-40% in weight αnd in mαnufαcturing costs.<br>
