				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a wrapping container for individually<br>
wrapping an interlabial pad of such a structure as facilitates surely and sanitadly<br>
fixing and unfixing the interlabial pad between the labia, and an individual<br>
wrapping body of the interlabial pad.<br>
Background Art<br>
Conventionally, a sanitary napkin and a tampon are used generally as<br>
female sanitary products. Here, there have been great efforts to prevent the<br>
leak of menstrual blood from gap caused by poor adhesion near the ostium<br>
vaginae as for the sanitary napkin. Moreover, as for the tampon, there have<br>
been great efforts for relieving the foreign feeling and the discomfort when<br>
wearing the sanitary products and intervaginal wearing trouble due to the nature<br>
of those products.<br>
Under such situation, sanitary products cf the interlabial pad here<br>
auracted people as a sanitary product positioned between the sanitary <br>
and the tampon in recent years.<br>
The interlabial pad is fixed by inserting it between the labia, having<br>
characteristics that it is difficult to cause the leak of menstrual blood because of<br>
higher adhesion to the body than that of the sanitary napkin and psychological<br>
resistance thereof on wearing is lower than that of the tampon which is inserted<br>
into the vagina.<br>
Here, as to such an interlabial pad, developments and arrangements<br>
concerning the materials therefore and their peripheral members are<br>
insufficient.<br>
The present invention has been made considering the problems as the<br>
above, and the purpose is to provide a preferred wrapping container for<br>
wrapping the interlabial pad as a preferred handling member of the interlabial<br>
Moreover, another purpose is to provide a wrapping container can<br>
smoothly be held on a container at the time of opening the wrapping container of<br>
the interlabial pad having a finger insertion opening.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
In order to solve the problems as mentioned above, according to the<br>
present invention, the inieriabial pad wrapping container is characterized in that<br>
it not only serves as a finger cot when the interla'oial pad is fixed in. but also<br>
permits an wrapping container opening action and a finger cot fixing action at<br>
the same time.<br>
Moreover, the wrapping container is also characterized in that to the<br>
inieriabial pad provided with a finger insertion opening for being fixed on the tip<br>
of a finger, the wrapping container opening action is an action itself to smoothly<br>
insert a finger into tne finger insertion opening as it is.<br>
To oe more concrete, the following arrangement is provided according to<br>
tne present invention<br>
(1) A wrapping container for individually wrapping an interlabial pad,<br>
comprising a separation portion for separating the wrapping container intc two<br>
separated sections, wherein each separated section after the separation turns<br>
up to be an operation member for wearing or removing said interlabial pad.<br>
According to the wrapping container for individually wrapping the<br>
interlabial pad (hereafter, simply called the wrapping container) relating to the<br>
present invention, the wrapping container of the interlabial pad is made<br>
multi-functional only by arranging a separation cart for separating the wrapping<br>
container into suitable sizes and scapes. Namely, the separation part is<br>
arranged on the trapping container so that the wrapping container is suitable<br>
as an auxiliary member for fixing/unfixing the the wrapping pad from area. For<br>
sample a separation ratio etc of the wrapping container separated by the<br>
even its effect. Therefore, the individual wrapping ccntainer possesses not<br>
only its original function that t permits to singly, santianly and easily carry only<br>
the interlabial pad to be used, but also the function that it can be used for fixing<br>
and unfixing the interlabial pad, and it permits to perform sanitarily fixing and<br>
unfixing the interlabial pad without such trouble as putting another finger cot on<br>
tne ringer.<br>
(2) The wrapping conta ner for individually wrapping an interlabial pad cf<br>
the aforementioned (1). wherein: said wrapping container is provided<br>
.respective!y with a finger insertion portion for inserting a finger respectively in a<br>
portion becoming respectively an separated section after the separation, and in<br>
a state where said wrapping ccntainer is separated into respective separated<br>
portion of respective separated sections which turn up to be an operation<br>
member wearing or removing said interlabial pad.<br>
According to the wrapping container for individually packaging an<br>
interlabial pad (hereafter, simply called a wrapping container) relating to tne<br>
present invention, the wrapping container is provided with a separation pan for<br>
dividing the wrapping container itself in two there, and finger insertion parts<br>
permitting to insert fingers therein in each part divided by the separation part.<br>
Therefore, a wearer can easily separate the wrapping container into two pieces<br>
by firstly inserting two fingers (for example, an index finger and a middle finger)<br>
into such insertion parts, respectively, and then opening the two fingers to the<br>
left and right, and also in this seperated state, the pieces of the saperated<br>
wrapping container are fixed on the t:ps cf the fingers as a result. And by<br>
maintaining this state, it becomes possible to fix and unfix the interabial pad<br>
using the sections cf the diviced ana separated wrapping container.<br>
Here, since the labia offer in form among individuals, fixing procedure<br>
are sometimes different when the interlabial pad is fixed. For example, in the<br>
case of a wearer having a separate type labia shape, she can directly fix the<br>
interlabial pad in the labia by bending the posture. On the other hand, in the<br>
case of a wearer having a joint type labia shape, the inside cf the labia is<br>
sometimes hard to be exposed only by bending the costume, and in such a case,<br>
she has to fix the interlabial pad therein while forcibly keeping the labia open<br>
using fingers cf another hand which is not holding the interlabial pad.<br>
When a labia opening action is performed, the fingers of the wearer have<br>
to come into direct contact with the labia. For this reason, dirt on the fingers<br>
may adhere to the labia, and this is a sanitary problem. Moreover, the muccus<br>
membrane may be stimulates. On the other hand menstrual bleed is apart<br>
adhere to fingers therefore, the wearer is obliged to such an uncomfortance<br>
and troublesome action as washing out the menstrual blood adhering to the<br>
fingers every time she fixes the interiabial pad therein.<br>
Regarding this point, the Japanese Utility Model Provisional Publication<br>
61-232545(232845/1985) discloses a f.nger cot peelably adherec on a mount<br>
as a usable one when a tampon is inserted in a vagina Thus, since the fingers<br>
of the wearer are prevented from coming into direct contact with the labia by<br>
fixing the interlabial pad by putting on such finger cots on the fingers, the labia<br>
part can be kept sanitary. Especially, since the finger cots are wrapped so as to<br>
be put on fingers without direct contact with the firgers they have also an effect<br>
of remarkably reducing a risk that the dirt on the fingers adheres to the labia.<br>
Moreover, the Japanese Utility Model Provisional Publication<br>
52-9450(3450/1987) discloses such a finger cot as is provided with a grip part<br>
for preventing the finger cot from coming off a finger. It has been, considered<br>
that non-contact between the labia and fingers may be more secured when<br>
some finger cots are used, because the finger cots fixed on the fingers at the<br>
time of fixing an interlabial pad are prevented from coming off the fingers of the<br>
wearer<br>
However, since the interlabial pad is fixed between the labia which are<br>
difficult to watch, the fixing is not necessarily easy. Therefore, since putting on<br>
the separate finger cots at the time of fixing the interlabial pad as the example<br>
described above complicates the handling procedure, there is a fear that the<br>
fixing action may be made more difficult.<br>
Then, it causes a longer fixing time if many actions have to be done at<br>
the time of fixing, and in such a case, menstrual biood may drop from inside of<br>
labia and adheres to an underwear and a toilet bowl or the periphery thereof, to<br>
make wearer feel uncomfortable for the treatments.<br>
As to this point, according to tne present invention, the fixing action can<br>
be aided through the use of the sections of the torn wrapping container<br>
moreover, when using such pieces, they are already held on the fingertips when<br>
the wrapping container is separated, therefore, the work process for purposely<br>
fixing them on the fingertips is unnecessany. Further, when separating the<br>
wrapping container, the wrapping container can easily be torn only by inserting<br>
two fingers of a non-dominant hand in the finger insertion parts and then<br>
opening them to the right and left, therefore, the fixing work can be speeded up.<br>
Further, when unfixing an used interlabial pad from labia, it is possible to<br>
unfix it through the use of an interlabial pad to be newly used in order to present<br>
menstrual blood from adhering to fingers or prevent the fingers from contacting<br>
the labia.<br>
Moreover, a "separation part in this specification means what is specifies<br>
in some form as a separated place of the wrapping container, and as a structure<br>
perfomations or the like which are an alternate arrangement of torn cares and<br>
cut part at the beginning of the separation part can be mentioned<br>
When [he separation part is formed of perforations, a slit part is preferred<br>
to be 0.5-5mm long and 3mm wide at the maximum, and an unslit part is<br>
preferred to be 0.5-5mm long. In such a manner, it is possible to guide the slit<br>
direction by the wearer not to deviate from the separation pad, and is also<br>
possible to prevent dirt or the like from penetrating into the wrapping container<br>
from the separation part. Moreover, in order for the separation pan to be easily<br>
slit, it is preferable to bring the separation pan into penetration state in the<br>
direction of thickness.<br>
As far as the starting point of the separation pan: formed of perforations is<br>
started from one end edge of the wrapping container prepared at least for finger<br>
insertion it does not matter even if the starting points connected up to another<br>
end edge or it is arranged only up to an intermediate position from the one end<br>
edge.<br>
The breaking strength of the perforations is preferably 0.2-3.0N/25mm.<br>
more preferably 0.3-1.5N/25mm, under the pulling conditions of a 25mm width<br>
and 100mm/min when the perforations are pulled in the direction orthogonal to<br>
the perforations with the perforations positioned in the center.<br>
(3) The wrapping container for individually wrapping an interlabial pad of<br>
the aforementioned (2), wherein: said finger insertion portion is composed of a<br>
mini sheet piece for a wrapping container attached so that an opening for<br>
inserting a finger be formed, with, two or more bonding portions to the wrapping<br>
container, and one or more non-bonding portions; and<br>
said mini sheet piece for wrapping container is attached in a state strding<br>
respectively to both sides of said separation portion.<br>
According to the wrapping container and wrapping an <br>
interlabial pad (hereafter, simply called a wrapping container relates to the<br>
present invention, tne finger insertion part is formed by attaching the finger<br>
insertion opening part and the following finger insertion space part to the<br>
wrapping container in a state unconnected to the wrapping container surface<br>
Therefore, a wearer can insert a finger from the opening of the finger insertion<br>
opening and fix the wrapping container on the fingertip (refer to Fig. 7).<br>
When a mini-sheet piece for tne wrapping container is made to be a<br>
belt-like piece in the present invention, the belt-like piece is to be attached to<br>
tne wrapping container in the state striding over the separation part (refer to Fig.<br>
5). Associated witn this, the separation part is arranged in the state penetrating<br>
both the wrapping container and the mini-sheet piece for the wrapping container<br>
in the direction of thickness, therefore, it is necessary to take care so as not to<br>
damage the mini-sheet piece for the wrapping container.<br>
Moreover, in the present invention, a plurality of the mini-sheet pieces for<br>
the wrapping container can be arranged on both sides bordered by tne<br>
separation part (refer to Fig. 6). Thus, the separation part is not arranged on the<br>
mini-sheet pieces for the wrapping container. Namely, the mini-sheet pieces for<br>
the wrapping container and the adhesion part do not exist on the separation part,<br>
so the breaking strength of the whole separation part can be made almost<br>
constant at the time of slitting and dividing the separation part. Therefore, the<br>
wrapping container can stably be separated compared with the case when a<br>
piece of belt-like mini-sheet for the wrapping container is attached striding ever<br>
the separation part.<br>
Tne mini-sheet pieces for the wrapping container can be joined to the<br>
wrapping container not only with an adhesive, cut also by means of<br>
rear-sealing, ultrasonic sealing, an adnesive tape or the like<br>
wrapping container by a wearer the mini-sheet pieces for the wrapping<br>
container are adjusted so as to have a different tone and pattern or chrcmatieny<br>
from those of the wrapping container by means of coloring or printing a pattern<br>
or the like.<br>
(4) The wrapping conrainer for individually wrapping an interiabial pad of<br>
the aforementioned (3), wherein: said mini sheet piece for wrapping container is<br>
attached to an outer face side and/or inner face side of said wrapping container.<br>
According to the wrapping container for individually packaging intarlabiai<br>
pad (hereafter, simply cailed a wrapping container) related to the present<br>
invention, the wrapping coniainer is provided with the mini-sheet pieces or the<br>
cuter surface or the inner surface cr on both of the cuter and inner surfaces.<br>
Here, in tne present invention, the wrapping container comes into contact<br>
with the labia on the inside surface. Therefore, in order to realize fixing or<br>
unfixing of a sanitary interlabial pad oy reducing adhesion of dirt and dust to<br>
labia, it is especially more preferable to arrange the mini-sheet pieces for the<br>
wrapping container on the outside than on the inside.<br>
(5) The wrapping container for individually wrapping an interiabiai pad of<br>
any of the aforementioned (2) to (4), wherein: said wrapping container for<br>
individually wrapping an interiabiai pad is a wrapping container for individually<br>
wrapping an interlabial pad for wrapping an interlabial pad having a finger<br>
insertion opening and the wrapping container for individually wrapping an<br>
intsrlabial pad is provided with a pre-unwrapped opening that allows the finger<br>
insertion opening of tne interlabial pad contained therein to be exposed<br>
naturally at the beginning of unwrapping of the wrapping container for<br>
individually wrapping en interlabial pad in adcition to said separation section<br>
According to the wrapping container for individially packaging the<br>
interlabial pad (hereafter, simply called a wrapping container, related to the<br>
present invention, the wrapping container is provided with a "pre-unwrapped<br>
opening" separately from the separation pan for slitting up the wrapping<br>
container. Since the finger insertion opening provided on the enclosed<br>
interlabial pad is exposed by opening such a pre-unwrapped opening, the finger<br>
insertion opening is brought into the state in which a wearer can watch it. Thus,<br>
the wearer is then able to insert a finger in the finger insertion opening<br>
immediately after the wearer has opened the wrapping container<br>
Moreover, in the present invention, the "pre-unwrapped opening' means<br>
what forms an unwrapped opening permitting to insert a finger in the finger<br>
insertion opening of tne interlabial pad through tnere. In the present invention,<br>
the size of this "pre-unwrapped opening" is sufficient as long es the wearer can<br>
the finger insertion opening of tne interlabial pad through the<br>
pre-unwrapped opening by unsealing it and she can insert her finger in the<br>
finger insertion opening, but as a size permitting to unfixing the Interlabial pad.<br>
the pre-unwrapped opening may be sized for permitting to unfix the intertabial<br>
pad through there.<br>
(6) The wrapping container for individually wrapping an interlabial pad of<br>
the aforementioned (5), composed of a series of wrapping sheet wound in a<br>
way to form a overlapping part where a part thereof is folded, or of a series of<br>
wrapping sheet wound in a way to form a overlapping part where both ends<br>
thereof are superposed each other, wherein:<br>
said pre-unwrapped opening is formed of said overlapping part.<br>
The wrapping container for individually wrapping the interlabial pad<br>
(hereafter, simply called a wrapping container) related to the present invention is<br>
formed by folding a wrapping sheet. And, a pre-unwrapped opening for opening<br>
the wrapping container is formed from the overlapping pad of both side parts of<br>
the folded wrapping steet. Therefore, a wearer is easily able to open the<br>
wrapping container by opening the overlapping pan of the wrapping sheet.<br>
As typical methods for folding a wrapping sheet, such methods can be<br>
mentioned as the wrapping sheet folded in three where the interlabial pad is<br>
placed approximately in the middle of the wrapping sheet and the wrapping<br>
sheet is folded inside from both side parts thereof (refer to Fig. 1), and the<br>
wrapping sheet is folded in half holding the interlabiai pad in between (refer to<br>
Fig. 9). In these cases, the overlapping part, where the side parts of the folded<br>
wrapping sheet are layered, serves as the pre-unwrapped opening, and is stuck<br>
by heat-sealing or the like so as to be peelable.<br>
Moreover, in order to facilitate unsealing the pre-unwrapped opening, in<br>
the case of the three-folded one, the overlapping part of the wrapping sheet can<br>
be provided with a stop tape with dry edges inserted and in the case of the<br>
double-folded one, the overlapping part can be provided with a tab thereon.<br>
Tnus, since a wearer can easily open the pre-unwrapped opening by picking up<br>
such a stop tape and tab, an action for fixing the interlabiai pad can be made<br>
speedier.<br>
(7) The wrapping container for individually wrapping an interlabial pad of<br>
the aforementioned (5), wherein: said pre-unwrapped opening is composed of a<br>
broken line whose both ends are connected to said separation portion, and a<br>
tearing portion formed by tearing off a part of said wrapping container for<br>
ndividually wrapping an interlabial pad along the broken line and<br>
the unwrapping is executed by tearing off a part of said wapping container for<br>
individually wrapping an interlabial pad along the broken line<br>
According to the wrapping container for individually wrapping interlabial<br>
pad (hereafter, simply called a wrapping container) related to the cresent<br>
invention, the pre-unwrapped opening for forming an unwrapped opening is<br>
seaned by tearing a part of the wrapping container along a broken the and<br>
pulling down the torn part.<br>
The "broken line" is formed in an inner side than the joining part for<br>
sealing the wrapping container in the overlapping part of the wrapping sheet,<br>
and the composition thereof is the same as the separation pari described in the<br>
item (2).<br>
Moreover, when the prs-opening part is comprised of the broken line, it is<br>
preferable to form the wrapping container by folding the wrapping sheet in two.<br>
In this case, the three edges except the folded part are joined by heat-sealing or<br>
the like.<br>
(5) The wrapping container for individually wrapping an interlabial pad of<br>
any of the aforementioned (5) to (7), wherein said separation portion and said<br>
pre-unwrapped opening are positioned to be opposed.<br>
According to the wrapping container for individually wrapping interlabial<br>
pad (hereafter simply called a wrapping container) related to the present<br>
invention, the pre-unwrapped opening and the separation part are arranged in<br>
the opposite positions to each other. Here, since the finger insertion part with<br>
the finger insertion openings is arranged in the neighborhood of the separation<br>
part, this allows a wearer to open the pre-unwrapped opening and insert fingers<br>
of her dominant hand therefrom into the finger insertion openings of the<br>
Interlabial pad, while th.s also allows her to insert fingers of another hand into<br>
the finger insertion opening of the wrapping container. As a result of this the<br>
interlabial pad can be taken out of the wrapping container by using both hands,<br>
therefore, such an unfixing action is made efficient and smooth<br>
(9) The wrapping container for individually wrapping an interlabial pad of<br>
the aforementioned (1), wherein: said wrapping container for individually<br>
wrapping an interlabial pad is a wrapping container for individually wrapping an<br>
interlabial pad for wrapping an interlabial pad having a finger insertion opening;<br>
said wrapping container is provided with a pre-unwrapped opening tnat allows<br>
the finger insertion opening of the interlabial pad contained therein to be<br>
exposed naturally at the beginning of unwrapping of the wrapping container,<br>
and a separation edge turning to be said separation portion; said wrapping<br>
container has a bean sheath shape, provided with said pre-unwrapping edge<br>
along one edge thereof and, at the same time, said separation edge is provided<br>
along the other edge continuous to this pre-unwrapping edge, and a finger cot<br>
where a finger can be inserted is formed right and left respective sides face<br>
becoming respectively an separated section after the separation of the wrapping<br>
container along said separation edge; and in a state where said wrapping<br>
container is separated into respective piece, the finger is inserted in said finger<br>
cct section portion in respective piece which turns up to be an operation<br>
member for wearing or removing said interlabial pad.<br>
According to the wrapping container for individually wrapping interlabial<br>
pad (hereafter, simply called a wrapping container) related to the present<br>
invention, when the interlabial pad is folded with the approximate center area in<br>
the longitudinal direction used as an axis and enclosed therein, the pad is<br>
shaped to be easy to fit. Therefore, this makes it possible to eliminate<br>
unnecessary gaps in the wrapping container, and also make it compact.<br>
Moreover, the wrapping container related to the present invention is<br>
provided with two finger cots on the side for inserting fingers therein. Therefore<br>
a wearer inserts two fingers (for example, an index finger and a middle finger) in<br>
each finger cot, respectively, ard then opens the fingers to both sides, and can<br>
thereby easily slit the wrapping container into two pieces. As a result of this, the<br>
slit pieces are firmly held on respective fingers, Therefore, this state allows the<br>
wearer to fix or unfix the interiabial pad. Thus, even when the wearer performs<br>
an action of opening the labia or the like, she can prevent the labia from<br>
touching the fingers.<br>
(10) The wrapping container fcr individually wrapping an inierlabial pad of<br>
the aforementioned (9), wherein: said pre-unwrapping edge is composed of a<br>
broken line whose both ends are connected said separation portion, and a<br>
tearing portion formed by tearing off a part of said wrapping container for<br>
individually wrapping an interiabial pad along the broken line; the unwrapping of<br>
said pre-unwrapping edge is executed by tearing off a part of said wrapping<br>
container for individually wrapping an interiabial pad along said broken line, and<br>
the starting point of said broken line is disposed in such a place to be positioned<br>
near the finger insertion opening of the interiabial pad. when said interiabial pad<br>
is contained.<br>
According to the wrapping cotainer for individually wrapping interlabial<br>
pad (hereafter, simply called a wrapping container) related to the present<br>
invention, a broken line is formed on a pre-unwrapped edge. Therefore, the<br>
wearer tears a part of the wrapping container along this broken line, and thereby<br>
she can open the pre-unwrapped edge, which is one edge part of the wrapping<br>
container, to make the finger insertion openings of the enclosed interiabial pad<br>
to be exposed, and can insert the fingers in such finger insertion openings.<br>
(11) The wrapping container for individually wrapping an interiabial pad of<br>
the aforementioned (1), wherein: said wrapping container composes a flat<br>
cylindrical shape longer than is wide where both ends are closed in a state<br>
where said wrapping container is separated into respective separated section at<br>
said separation portion, the wrapped interiabial pad is exposed and, at tne<br>
same time, the separation portion of the separated respective piece becomes<br>
an opening where a finger can be inserted, and with a finger is inserted from<br>
the opening, the separated section turns up to be an operation member for<br>
wearing or removing said interlabial pad.<br>
According to the wrapping container for individually wrapping interlabial<br>
pad (hereafter, simply called a wrapping container) related to the present<br>
invention, the two split pieces themselves serve as the finger cots for the<br>
interiabiai pad handling members. Therefore, as described in the<br>
aforementioned (2), this arrangement eliminates the neec for such a<br>
manufacturing process as attaching a mini-sheet piece separately, and permits<br>
to simplify the manufacturing process.<br>
Moreover, since the length from the inside of the joint part of both closed<br>
edges up to the separation part is an insertion length of a single finger, the<br>
dimension needs to be such a length as each section does not easily slip off the<br>
fingers inserted from the opening, namely, the separation part before cutting<br>
and after tne action for fixing and unfixing the interlabial pad. Further in the<br>
state before separation, the length from the inside of the joined part of one edge<br>
end up to the inside of the other edge end needs to have a dimension permitting<br>
tc enclose the interiabiai pad. From these, the length is preferable to be at<br>
least 40mm, more preferably, it is in a range of 60-90mm to avoid causing a<br>
feeling of too much slack. Moreover, it is customary that, as to the joined pan<br>
at both edge ends of the wrapping container, the length from the end of the<br>
wrapping container toward the separation part is arranged within a range of<br>
2-5mm.<br>
Also as to a width dimension of the wrapping container, the wider is<br>
preferred to be 20mm or wider considering fixation of the enclosed interlabial<br>
pad to the wrapping container, finger insertion and holding ability of the inserted<br>
state, more preferably, the width is to be arranged within a range of 25-10mm.<br>
When the separation part is formed from a broken line, the internals<br>
between the slits of the broken line are arbitrarily arranged, however, the fear<br>
strength of the broken line is at least 1N/25mm or more, preferably it is within a<br>
range of 0.2-3.0N/25mm, considering that the break of the wrapping container<br>
should be guided along the broken line; the packaging material should not be<br>
damaged; and it should have a preservation capability. Moreover, the numerical<br>
value is defined as a reading of the maximum load when measuring the tear<br>
strength at a speed 100mm/min by holding respective edge ends with the upper<br>
and lower chucks using a tensilon tensile tester and then partly cutting the tip of<br>
the broken line with scissors.<br>
(12) The wrapping container for individually wrapping an interlabial pad of<br>
the aforementioned (11), wherein: said separation portion is set in such length<br>
that the starting point thereof starts from one end edge and the terminal thereof<br>
does not reach the opposed other end edge.<br>
Acccrding to the wrapping container for individually packaging interlabial<br>
pad (hereafter, simply called a wrapping container) related to the present<br>
invention, the separation part is arranged so as to start from one edge end of<br>
said wrapping container and not to be extended up to the other edge end, but to<br>
end in the neighborhood thereof. To be more concrete, for example, in a portrait<br>
form wrapping container, the separation part is started from the edge end which<br>
is one side part in the longitudinal direction, and ended so as not to reach the<br>
other side part opposite thereto (refer to Fig. 19). Therefore, the wrapping<br>
container is not completely separated into two before it has been fixed or<br>
unfixed, but is maintained as it is in the connected state in the cart where the<br>
separation part does not exists. As a result of this, to put the separated sections<br>
on the fingertips, the two fingers can be inserted in the rescecive sector at<br>
the same time, and moreover, one of the sections is prevented from being test<br>
therefore, handling is simplified and also speeded up.<br>
Moreover, when an interlabial pad with finger insertion openings is<br>
enclosed the interlabial pad is enclosed so that such finger insertion<br>
are directed to tne edge end sice wnere the separation pan is started and<br>
thereby a wearer can watch the finger insertion openings immediately after<br>
opening the wrapping container. Moreover, the range where the separation part<br>
is not provided is preferred to be about 2-10mm from one edge end.<br>
(13) A wrapping container for individually wrapping an interlabial pad,<br>
comprising a containment container for wrapping directly an interlabial, and an<br>
cuter wrapping container for wrapping an inner wrapping body containing me<br>
interlabial pad in said inner wrapping container, wherein: said inner wrapping<br>
container composes a fiat cylindrical shape longer in an is wide where both ends<br>
are closed; said inner wrapping container is provided with a separation portion<br>
for separating said wrapping container into two small pieces; and in a state<br>
where said wrapping container is separated into respective separated section at<br>
said separation portion, the separation portion of respective piece becomes an<br>
opening where a finger can be inserted, and by inserting the finger from the<br>
opening turns up to be an operation member for wearing or removing said<br>
interlabial pad.<br>
According to the wrapping container for individually packaging interlabial<br>
pad (hereafter, simply called a wrapping container) related to the present<br>
invention, the wrapping container is double-structured consisting of an inner<br>
wrapping container and an outer-wrapping container, and the inner wrapping<br>
container of them is a member for aiding the fixing and unfixing actions of the<br>
wrapping container. Therefore, they can also be properly used; for example, the<br>
inner wrapping container is used for fixing and unfixing the interlabial pad and<br>
tne outer wrapping container is used for enclosing the used interlabial pad, so<br>
menstrual blood having achered to the wrapping container can be presented<br>
from further adhering to the fingers.<br>
(14) A wrapping container for individually wrapping an interlabial pad<br>
having a finger insertion opening, wherein: said wrapping container is made of a<br>
wrapping sheet having a pocket portion capable of an interlabial pad of a size<br>
and shape allowing to hold by pinching between the labia, in a state where the<br>
interlabial pad is folded half longitudinally taking the longitudinal direction of<br>
interlabial pad as an axis.<br>
According to the wrapping container for individually packaging interlabial<br>
pad (hereafter, simply called a wrapping container) related to the present<br>
invention, a pocket portion is formed on the wrapping container beforehand.<br>
Therefore, by enclosing an unused interlabial pad in this pocket portion<br>
beforehand, the interlabial pad is prevented from falling out when a wears'<br>
cpens the wrapping container to take out the interlabial pad. Moreover by<br>
directing the finger insertion, openings of the interlabial pad toward the opening<br>
of this pocket portion, the fingers can be inserted in the finger insertion<br>
openings making good use of tne state in which the interlabial pad is enclosed<br>
in tne pocket portion (refer to Fig. 30).<br>
Moreover, when a wearer holds an interlabial pad on the fingertips by<br>
inserting the fingers in the finger insertion openings of said interlabial pad to<br>
unfix the interlabial pad which has been fixed in the labia, she inserts the<br>
interlabial pad in the pocket portion together with the fingers at the time of<br>
taking cut the used interlabial pad from the fingertips, and fixes the interiabiai<br>
pad in the pocket portion by picking it from the outside (outside of the wrapping<br>
container) of the pocket portion, by the other hand and she can draw her fingers<br>
from the finger insertion openings in that state (refer to Fig. 31) in such a<br>
manner the finger can be drawn out without adhesion of menstrual blood or the<br>
like to the finger. Moreover the used interlabial pad can be broken away without<br>
contact between the menstrual blood and the hands of the wearer and further<br>
container, it looks also sanitary.<br>
When the used interiabiai pad is re-held in the wrapping container the<br>
menstrual blood absorbed in the interiabiai pad sometimes contacts with the<br>
pocket pertion in the neighborhood of its opening and adheres thereto.<br>
Therefore, the menstrual blood is prevented from adhering to a wearer's hand<br>
by covering the opening of the pocket portion by the part other than the pocket<br>
portion in the wrapping sheet, and this ensures a sanitary treatment.<br>
Moreover, the wrapping container is preferred to be provided with a<br>
sealing means such as a stop tape on the part covering the pocket portion. This<br>
arrangement makes it possible to surely keep the used interiabiai pad enclosed<br>
:n the wrapping container, and prevents the interiabiai pad from falling out and<br>
sanitarily<br>
(15) The wrapping container for individually wrapping an interlabial pad of<br>
tne aforementioned (14), wherein said pocket portion comprises a place where<br>
a part of a series of wrapping sheet is bent.<br>
According to the wrapping container for individually packaging interlabial<br>
pad (hereafter, simply called a 'wrapping container) related to the present<br>
invention, the pocket portion is formed by folding a part of a series of wrapping<br>
sheets. Therefore, the pocket portion communicates with the other parts of the<br>
wrapping container, and a holding capability of the cocker portion to the<br>
wrapping container is secured<br>
Such a wrapping container forms the pocket portion, for example by<br>
folding one lengthwise end part or a series of portrait form wrapping sheets<br>
toward the surface (inside) where the interbial pad is to be placed, and forming<br>
both side edges or one side edge where the wrapping sheets overlap each<br>
other on each side. Thus, to form the packed portion it is preferable to arrange<br>
the joined part only in the contact area of the wrapping sheets. Thus, the joined<br>
part of the wrapping container is surely maintained at the time of re-housing the<br>
used interlabial pad<br>
in such a constitution, the wrapping sheets can be folded toward the<br>
pocket portion in other part where the pocket portion is formed, and it becomes<br>
possible to cover the menstrual blood adhering to the pocket portion in the<br>
neighborhood of its opening when re-housing the used interlabial pad in the<br>
pocket portion, and a risk that menstrua! blood may adhere 10 fingers is<br>
reduced.<br>
(16) A wrapping container for individual wrapping of an ir.terlabiai pas<br>
provided with a mini sheet piece of interlabial pad forming a finger insertion<br>
provided for indicating the vertical direction related to the pre-unwrapping<br>
portion for unwrapping said wrapping container.<br>
According to the wrapping container for individually packaging interlabial<br>
pad (hereinafter, simply called a wrapping container) related to the present<br>
invention, a top and a bottom of the wrapping container are indicated. Therefore.<br>
a wearer can easily grasp the position of the pre-opening part as the place to be<br>
unsealed.<br>
As tc "an vertical direction indication means" in the present invention, for<br>
example, the following means can be mentioned such as a usually checkable<br>
means by printing a pattern or characters etc on the wrapping container and a<br>
finger-touch comprehensible means by arranging ruggedness on the wrapping<br>
container by tooling or the like. Here, by using a company emblem house<br>
container can also be provided with the effects of adversement and quality<br>
product.<br>
In the present invention, "the vertical direction related to the pre-opening<br>
cart" means such a state as the suggestion of the vertical direction seems to<br>
indicate the position of the pre-opening part as it is, when there is something<br>
like a kind of tendency (for example, the upper part is opened more often or the<br>
lower part is opened more often) concerning the place where the upper and<br>
lower directional wrapping container is to be opened.<br>
(17) A wrapping container for individual wrapping of an interlabial pad<br>
having different finger insertion point according to the personal equation<br>
wnerein: a pre-unwrapping portion is provided for unwrapping said individual<br>
wrapping container, said pre-unwrapping portion is disposed in plurality<br>
individually wrapped interlabial and, moreover, said wrapping container is<br>
provided with an unwrapping position guide means for guiding the kind of said<br>
finger insertion position.<br>
According to the wrapping container for individually packaging interlabial<br>
pad (hereafter, simply called a wrapping container) related to the present<br>
invention, when a plurality of finger insertion openings are arranged for holding<br>
the interlabial pad on fingertips, the wrapping container is also provided with<br>
plural pre-opening parts corresponding thereto, and a wearer is instructed which<br>
ore-opening part to open. Therefore, before opening the wrapping container, the<br>
wearer can easily know from the appearance of ire wrapping container which<br>
pre-opening part should be opened to immediately insert finger in the fingers<br>
insertion holes suitable for herself.<br>
As an opening position instruction means in the present invertion <br>
may only be such a means as the wearer can grasp the optimal pre-opening<br>
part, also for example, parting and selecting of characters and patterns of the<br>
like, ruggedness by tooling or the like, etc. arranged in the periphery of said<br>
pre-opening part or all the pre-opening pans can be mentioned.<br>
(18) A wrapping container for individually wrapping an interlabial pad<br>
having a mini-sheet piece to form finger insertion openings, wherein: the<br>
pre-unwrapping portion for unwrapping said wrapping container is unwrapped<br>
by tearing off a part of said wrapping container along a broken line introducing<br>
the position of said pre-unwrapping portion: and the interlabial pad is enclosed<br>
so that said finger insertion opening is exposed first, in a state where sa,d<br>
pre-unwrapping portion is unwrapped.<br>
According to the wrapping container for individually packaging interiabial<br>
pad (hereafter, simply called a wrapping contairer) related to tne present<br>
invention, tne pre-opening parts are formed of broken lines. Namely, such<br>
broken lines are provided on the side inner than the part joined for forming the<br>
wrapping container, therefore, a wearer does not peel the joined part of tne<br>
wrapping container but tear a part of the wrapping container along said broken<br>
lines, and can thereby unseal such pre-opening part(s) to take out the interiabial<br>
pad<br>
These broken lines have only to show the tearing position and direction to<br>
the wearer, and as to the structure, an alternate sequence of slits and non-slits<br>
like perforations can be mentioned. The broken lines of such a structure are<br>
preferred to have 0.5 - 5mm long slit parts, a 3mm maximum width, and 0.5 -<br>
3mm long non-slit parts. Such arrangements can not only guide the direction<br>
torn by the wearer not to deviate from the broken lines but can prevent dirt and<br>
dust from entering through the broken lines.<br>
Moreover, in the present invention such broken lines have only to be<br>
arranged within the range to form a frontage only permitting to take out the<br>
The breaking strength of the broken line is preferred to be 0.2 -<br>
3.0N/25mm when the broken line is arranged in the center and is pulled in the<br>
directions orthogonal to the broken line under the tensile conditions of 25mm<br>
width and 100mm/min, and more preferably, it is 0.3 - 1.5N/25mm<br>
In order for a wearer to visually grasp the broken line with ease, a starting<br>
point of the broken line can be provided with a printed arrow or a section in the<br>
neighborhood of the starting point different from that for tne end pan for<br>
example, the end part is rounded etc.)<br>
Moreover, by forming the wrapping container gradually wider in the<br>
direction of the starting point of the broken line and narrower in the opposite<br>
direction on the other hand, it is aiso possible to attach the mini-sheet piece for<br>
the wrapping container so that tne finger insertion opening(s) is positioned in<br>
the direction opposite to the direction in which the wrapping container is formed<br>
wider, in such a manner, when a wearer handles the wrapping container<br>
enclosing the interlabial pad therein, it is possible to induce the wearer to take<br>
the narrower-formed side of the wrapping container by the hand, therefore, the<br>
wearer is able to insert her fingers in the finger insertion cpening(s) provided in<br>
the wrapping body without changing the direction of the wrapping container.<br>
Further, the wearer can smoothly insert her finger(s) in the finger insertion<br>
opening(s) without changing the direction of the interlabial pad as well as the<br>
wrapping container by arranging the finger insertion opening's also to be faced<br>
in the same direction as the finger insertion opening(s) of the wrapping<br>
container.<br>
Moreover, to reduce misconception of an opening action of the<br>
pre-opening part, the joined part of the wrapping container presented outside of<br>
the broken lines is preferred tc be increased in joining strength beforehand.<br>
(19) The wrapping container for individually wrapping an interlabial pad of<br>
any of the aforementioned (1) to (15) composed of a laminate material having<br>
inner sheet at the inner face side, and film sheet on the outer face side.<br>

following materials can be mentioned considering the requirements that me<br>
materials permit to smoothly pull cut ice interlabial pad from the wapping<br>
container and they should have hydrophilic property, fiber density and soft<br>
feeling, etc. For example, they are; wet spun lace nonwoven fabric which is a<br>
mixture of crepe tissue of 15 - 50g/m2 and cotton and pulp and is obtained in the<br>
range of 15 - 70g/m2 by adjusting the cotton at 10%wt at least, spun lace<br>
nonwoven fabric obtained in the range of 20 - 70g/rrr by adjusting rayon fiber at<br>
30%wt at least, melt blown nonwoven fabric composed of polypropylene<br>
obtained in the range of 20 - 50g/m2, composite nonwoven fabric composed of<br>
spun bond, melt blown, and spun bond ranging 6- 10g/m2, 5 - 20g/m2, and 6 -<br>
10g/m2 by weight, respectively, etc.<br>
As detailed materials to be placed or, the "outside surface side"<br>
considering water resisting property, a polyethylene film obtained in tne range of<br>
10 - 30g/m2, and an open hole plastic sheet with an open hole rate of 10 - 33%<br>
adjusted to the range of 15 - 30g/m2 can be mentioned.<br>
The material for said inside surface side and outside surface side are<br>
laminated by means of known techniques such as not melt adhesive, heat<br>
Considering the feeling, it is preferable in such laminating that a coating<br>
cuantity is made within a range of 3 - 13g/m2 and the laminating is performed<br>
within a 5 - 40% coating area in a spirai or striped form arrangement in the case<br>
of a hot melt adhesive, and that the laminating is performed within a 5 - 20%<br>

pad (hereafter, simply called a wrapping container) relates to the present<br>
invention, tne composition materials are a biodegradable material and/or a<br>
water-soluble material and/or a water-dispersible material. Therefore, when the<br>
wrapping container is made of the water-soluble material of the<br>
water-dispersible material, a wearer can throw it into the toilet bowl, therefore,<br>
the wearer is relieved from the trouble of the dispcsal, and also it is possible to<br>
reduce rubbish in the toilette.<br>
As detailed examples of such a wrapping container, a composite material<br>
laminating tissue adjusted to a 15 - 40g/m2 specific weight per unit area and<br>
polyvinyl alcohol of a 20 - 50 g/ m2 specific weight per unit area and coated with<br>
silicone within a ranee of 0.5 - 1 g/ m2 on the side of polyvinyl alconcl spun <br>
nonwoven fabric of poly-lactic fiber as a main substance adjusted to a 15 - 10g.<br>
m2 specific weight per unit area, etc can be mentioned.<br>
Moreover, the interlabial pad enclosed in such a wrapping container is<br>
preferred to be biodegradable water-soluble, and Such<br>
arrangements make it possible to throw away an used interlabial pad into the<br>
toiler bowl, tnerefore, the used interlabial pad can easily and sanitarly be<br>
disposed. And, since the interlabial pad can be thrown away into the toilet bowl<br>
together with the wrapping container, the arrangement have anotner effect of<br>
further reducing rubbish in the toilet.<br>
Here in this specification, the "biodegradability" means that a substance<br>
is degraded into gases like carbon dioxide, methane, etc., water, and biomass<br>
according to the process of the nature under the existence of bacteria starting<br>
with ray fungi and other microorganisms under an anaerobic or aerobic<br>
condition, and that the biodegradability (biodegradable rate, biodegradable<br>
degree, etc.) of said substance compares with a naturally produced material like<br>
fallen leaves or the like or synthetic polymer generally recognized as<br>
bodegradable in the same environment. Tne "water dispersibility" means as<br>
same as water degradability, meaning such a property as a substance is not<br>
influenced by a limited quantity of water (menstrual blood) when used but the<br>
fibers are easily dispersed into small pieces tc such a limit as they do not cause<br>
clogging ordinary toilet wiping with themselves at least in a iarge quantity of<br>
water or water current. The "water solubility" means such a property as the<br>
substance is not influenced by a limited quantity of water (menstrual blood;<br>
when used but dissolved in a large quantity of water or water current.<br>

interlabial pad are opened, and enclosed in the wrapping container for<br>
individually wrapping interlabial pad (hereafter, simply called wrapping<br>
container).<br>
Regarding this point, a sheet-like sanitary product such as a napkin<br>
generally encloses the content folded therein for making the wrapping body<br>
compact, however, in the present invention, the folded interlabial pad is opened<br>
as the wrapping container for individual interlabial pad is opened, and this<br>
makes a gap between the mini-sheet piece and the back sheet of the interlabial<br>
pad and the wrapping container will thus have an another effect of naturally-<br>
forming the finger insertion opening(s) in addition to such compact-making.<br>
As such a folding method, for example the interlabial pad is folded along<br>
the approximately longitudinal center line of tne inierlabiai pad with the surface<br>
with the mini-sheet piece of said interlabial pad faced inside.<br>
(22) Tne wrapping body of the aforementioned (21). wherein: said<br>
interlabial pad is contained, so that said mini sheet piece for said interiabial pad<br>
is folded toward the opposite side to the body side along the substantial central<br>
line in the longitudinal direction of said interlabial pad<br>
Moreover, in the present invention, the meaning of "so as to be folded<br>
toward opposite side to the body side" includes not only the case that it is<br>
completely folded to be convex toward opposite side to tne body side but also<br>
the case that it is curved to be convex toward opposite side to the body side<br>
(23) A wrapping body, comprising: an interlabial pad provided with a inner<br>

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
Next, the embodiments of the present invention will be explained referring<br>
to the drawings.<br>
[Interlabial pad individual wrapping container separable to two sections]<br><first embodiment><br>
Firstly, the structure of the interlabial pad individual wrapping container<br>
(hereafter, simply called wrapping container) provided with mini-sheet for the<br>
wrapping container will be explained. Fig. 1 is a process drawing snowing a<br>
process for forming a wrapping body 3 by folding tne wrapping body 11 for the<br>
wrapping container 1 while enclosing the interlabial pad 2 therein: Fig 2 is a<br>
sectional view taken along the arrow line A-A of Fig 1 (D): Fig. 3 is a process<br>
drawing showing a method for opening the wrapping container; and Fig. 4 is a<br>
drawing showing a state in which an index finger is inserted in a belt body 22<br>
which is a mini-sheet piece for the interlabial pad.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1 (A), the interlabial pad 2 is firstly placed with lhe<br>
opposite side face to body side face 2a. Next, as shown in (B) of the same<br>
figure, one side part 11a of the wrapping sheet 11 is folded inside along the<br>
longitudinal side edge part of the interlabial pad 2 and further as shown in 11<br>
of the same figure, the other end part 11b of the wrapping sheet 11 is also<br>
folded inside. Thus, as shewn in (D) of the same figure an overlapping part<br>
of the side part 11a and the side part 11b is formed, and this overlapping part<br>
becomes the pre-unwrapped opening. This overlapping part to be sealed with a<br>
peelable stop tape 14. And, by temporary tacking the upper and lower edges of<br>
the wrapping sheet by means of heat-sealing, ultrasonic-sealing etc , so as to<br>
be unsealed again, the interlabial pad 2 is enclosed so as not to fail out and<br>
thus the wrapping body 3 is formed.<br>
In the wrapping body 3, as shown in Fig 2, the belt body 22 fixed on the<br>
interlabial pad 2 is positioned directly under the overlapping pan 11c formed by<br>
the overlap of the side parts 11a, 11b of the wrapping sheet 11 Therefore, a<br>
wearer can immediately find the belt body 22 by opening the overlapping part<br>
11 c and can insert a finger in the finger insertion opening 23.<br>
To open the wrapping body 3 shown in Fig. 3 (A), the stop rape 14 is<br>
firstly picked up and pulled in the direction of A. Thus, the side part 11b of the<br>
wrapping sheet 11 is opened outward as shown in (C) of the same figure<br>
Fcliowing this, as shown in (D) of the same figure, the other side part 11a of the<br>
wrapping sheet 11 is also opened outward, and thereby the belt body 22 fixed<br>
on the interlabial pad 2 can be exposed. Therefore, a wearer can easily find the<br>
belt body 22 without turning over the interlabial pad 2.<br>
Then, as shown in Fig. 4, the wearer inserts the index finger or middle<br>
finger of her dominant hand (usually right hand) in the finger insertion opening<br>
23 formed from the exposed beit body 22 so that the ball of the finger comes in<br>
contact with the opposite side face to body side face 2a of the interlabial pad 2,<br>
to hold the interlabial pad 2 on the fingertip.<br>
Next, the mini-sheet piece for the wrapping container fixed on the<br>
wrapping container, and a method for separating the wrapping container by<br>
using the same will be explained. Fig. 5 shows the rear face of Fig. 3 and<br>
shows the views of the wrapping container 1 provided with a broken line 15 and<br>
a section part 17 which are the separation part for separating the belt body 12,<br>
which is the mini-sheet piece "or the wrapping ccntainer from the wrapping<br>
container 1, arc Fig. 6 is a drawing showing another mode of the belt body 12.<br>
anc Fig. 7 is a process drawing for showing a process oi taking out the<br>
interlabial pad 2 by separating the wrapping pad 1 therefrom.<br>
As shown in (A) of Fig. 5, the wrapping container 1 is provided with the<br>
broken line 15 in the center. And, the belt body 12, which is the mini-sheet piece<br>
for the wrapping container, is fixed thereon striding over this broken line 15. As<br>
shown in (B) of Fig. 5, a sectional view taken along the arrow line B-E of Fig. 5<br>
(A), the joining of this belt body 12 is performed with an adhesive 16 applied to<br>
the three points in total, which are both right and ieft side parts of the belt oody<br>
12 and the part along the broken line 15. The belt body 12 fixed in such a<br>
manner forms finger insertion parts 13A and 13B, and a wearer inserts two<br>
fingers of her non-dominant hand (usually left hand) in these finger insertion<br>
openings 13A and 133, and can thereby hold the wrapping container 1 on the<br>
fingertips.<br>
Here, the broken line 15 makes the separation parts in this embodiment<br>
however, as shown in Fig. 5 (C). the wrapping container 1 can be separated by<br>
providing the wrapping container 1 with a section part 17 on the upper part<br>
thereof for starting the separation with this. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 5 (D)<br>
both of the broken line 15 and the section part 17 may be arranged<br>
Moreover, as shown in Fig. 6 (A), two pieces of belt bodies 12 can<br>
symmetrically be arranged holding the broken line 15 in-between. Since the<br>
belt body 12 does not exist on the broken line 15 in such a manner, the<br>
breaking strength can be made almost constant at the time of separating the<br>
wrapping container 1 by tearing the broken line 15. Therefore, the wrapping<br>
container 1 shown in Fig. 6 (A) can be divided stably than the wrapping<br>
container 1 shown in Fig. 5 (A).<br>
Moreover, in this case, as shown in Fig. 6 (B), a sectional view take<br>
along the arrow line C-C of Fig. 5 (A), the adhesive 16 is applied to the<br>
respective side edges of the two belt bodies 12. therefore, the adhesive 16<br>
needs to be applied to four application areas in totai.<br>
Both of the belt bodies 12 are arranged to be of the same dimensions as<br>
shown in Fig. 6 (A), but can be arranged to be of different dimensions as shown<br>
in (C) of the same figure. For example, as shown in (D) of the same figure, it is<br>
possible to induce a wearer to insert her middle finger in the linger insertion<br>
opening 13A, and her index finger in the finger insertion opening 133 by making<br>
the longitudinal lengths different from each other.<br>
To divide the wrapping container 1, as shown in Fig. 7 (A), firstly, two<br>
fingers, the index finger and middle finger of the left hand, are inserted in the<br>
finger insertion openings 13A and 13B formed holding the broken line 15<br>
in-between, respectively. Next, as shown in (3) of the same figure, the two<br>
fingers are opened to the left and right. The wrapping container 1 is then torn<br>
along the broken line 15 to the left and right by this release force and the<br>
sections 1A and 1B are separated. And, the wearer can take out the interlabial<br>
pad 2 from the wrapping container 1 by moving the right hand holding tne<br>
interlabial pad 2.<br>
Then, as shown in Fig. 8, while opening the interlabial by the fingers of<br>
the left hand which are holding the sections 1A and 1B of the wrapping<br>
container 1, the wearer can fix the interlabial pad 2 held on the index finger of<br>
the right hand in the labia. Therefore, such a situation never occurs, as the<br>
fingers come in contact with the labia and menstrual blood during fixing action<br>
In this embodiment, the dimensions of the interlabial pad 2 are such as<br>
can put into the labia without difficulty and can also be held by fastening force of<br>
the labia themselves, and further, the blocking property of the labia is aiso<br>
considered Concretely, the longitudinal dimension is 60 - 150mm, and the<br>
outward widthwise length of the interlabial pad is preferred to be 10 - 60mm<br>
more preferably. it is recommended to be in a range of 20 - 40mm. When the<br>
widthwise length exceeds 60mm, the region not iying between the labia rubs the<br>
femoral region etc. of the wearer and the friction force caused thereby exceeds<br>
the holding force of the labia, and the interlabial pad is in danger of falling out.<br>
Moreover, when widthwise length is shorter than 10mm, the region capable of<br>
lying between the labia decreases and a touch area with the inner face of the<br>
labia decreases, and the interlabial pad is apt to fall out. Here, the<br>
above-mentioned "outward" means that the length is the shortest distance<br>
between the two points corresponding to V in Fig. 58). This is carefully defined<br>
because the way tracing the convex and concave form between the two points,<br>
namely, the distance between the two points in the state in which the convex<br>
and concave form is developed and flattened is sometimes treated as an actual<br>
distance (corresponding to W in Fig. 58) associated with the manufacturing<br>
process. Moreover, the thickness dimension is arranged in a range of 2 - 10mm<br>
considering a comfort feeling without extremely damaging the feeling of<br>
wearing.<br>
Considering such a filling property of the interlabial pad and a fitting<br>
property of the belt body 12, it is preferable that the lengthwise dimension is in a<br>
range of 80 - 170mm and the widthwise dimension is in a range of 60 - 90mm.<br>
Moreover, it is necessary that the widthwise dimension of the belt bodies<br>
12 are arranged so as not stick out of the width of such a wrapping container 1,<br>
and have a 25mm width at least so that the width permits to insert two fingers in<br>
the two finger insertion coenings 23A and 233 Concretely the width is<br>
preferred to be in a range of 25 - 80mm.<br>
Moreover, the lengthwise dimension of tne bell body 12 may be at least<br>
36mm of longer, and it may be elongated up in the end of the wrapping<br>
container 1 unless it is in a range of sticking out of the wrapping cointainer<br><second embodiment><br>
Next, a wrapping container provided with a mini-sheet piece for the<br>
wrapping container and folded in two will be explained. Fig. 9 is a process<br>
drawing illustrating the processes for forming the wrapping body 33 by<br>
containing the interlabial pad 2 in the wrapping container 31, Fig 10 is a<br>
sectional view taken along the arrow line D-D of Fig. 9 (C); Fig. 11 illustrates the<br>
wrapping container 41 on which the pre-unwrapped opening is formed from the<br>
broken line 45; Fig. 12 illustrates a wrapping container 51 formed by sticking<br>
two wrapping sheets 51A and 51B together; and Fig 13 is a process drawing<br>
illustrating a method for opening the wrapping container 31 and taking out the<br>
interlabial pad 2, and also separating the wrapping container 31 into two<br>
sections 31A and 31B.<br>
In order to form tne wrapping body 35. as shown in Fig. 9 (A), the<br>
interlabial pad 2 is folded along the vertical axis so that the left and right side<br>
edges overlap each other. In this case, the interlabial pad is folded with the<br>
opposite side face to body side face 2a inside, where the belt body 22. the<br>
mini-sheet piece for the interlabial pad, is fixed.<br>
Next, as shown in (B) of the same figure, the folded interlabial pad 2 is<br>
placed on the right side of the wrapping sheet 31, and then the wrapping sheet<br>
30 is folded in half centering the vertical axis of the wrapping sheet 30, to cover<br>
the interlabial pad 2. Following this, as shown in (C) of the same figure, joining<br>
carts 51a. 31b, 31c are arranged on the overlapping cart for forming we<br>
pre-opening part, to make the wrapping body 33 by joining each of them<br>
However, the rab 34 is not open in this case. As a result the belt body 92<br>
which is the mini-sheet piece for me wrapping container, is to be placed on the<br>
Inside this wrapping body 23. as shown in Fig 31 are belt body 33<br>
resitioned opposite to be joining part 31b. Therefore, peering this joining cart<br>
31b to open the wrapping body a wearer can immediately recognize the set<br>
body 22.<br>
In tnis embodiment, the pre-unwrapped opening of the wrapping<br>
container 31 is formed from the joining pans 31a. 31b and 31c joined by<br>
heat-sealing permitting re-peeling thereof, however, the pre-unwapped opening<br>
can also be formed from the broken line 45 arranged inside the joining parts 41a,<br>
41b, 41c as that on the wrapping container 41 shown in Fig. 11. It is possible<br>
to form an unwrapped opening by opening the pre-unwrapped opening by<br>
cutting out the end part of the wrapping container 41 along tnis broken line 45.<br>
According to the embodiment shown in Fig. 11. the interiabial pad 2 is<br>
covered by a single wrapping sheet, however, as the wrapping container 51<br>
shown in Fig. 12(A), two wrapping sheets 52, are 51B are used, and<br>
interiabial pad 2 is placed in-between, and then both of the wrapping sheets<br>
51A and 515 are stuck together by joining the four joining part 51a. 51b, 51c<br>
and 51d. In this case the broken line 55 is inside the joining parts 51a 51b and<br>
51c.<br>
The wrapping container 31 in this embodiment has two tabs 34 as shown<br>
in Fig. 13 (A). Therefore, as shown in (B) of the same figure, a wearer can open<br>
the wrapping container sequentially from the joining part 31 b to the joining parts<br>
31a. 31c by pulling the tabs 34 to the left and right, and can expose the belt<br>
figure, the index finger of the right hand is inserted in the finger insertion<br><br>
the index finger and middle finger of the left hand are inserted into the belt body<br>
32 of tne wrapping container, to fix the wrapping container on the left hand.<br>
In this state, the wearer can take cut the interlabial pad 2 from the<br>
wrapping container 31 by raising the right hand to the upper right. Following this,<br>
as shown in (E) of the same figure, the wrapping container 31 can be separated<br>
in to the sections 31A and 31 B by opening the index finger and the middle finger<br>
to the left and right. Thus, while the wearer is opening the labia using the<br>
sections 31A and 313 held on the fingers of the left hand, she can fix the<br>
interlabial pad 2 heid on the right hand at an appropriate position in the labia.<br><third embodiment><br>
Next, a pod-like wrapping container having a finger cot on the side will be<br>
explained. Fig. 14 is a process drawing showing a method for opening a<br>
pod-like wrapping container 61, taking out the interlabial pad 2, and separating<br>
said wrapping container 51 into two sections 61Aand 61B at the same time.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1- (A) the wrapping container 61 is provided with a<br>
broken line 64 for forming a pre-unwrapped opening. Therefore, as shown in 16<br>
of the same figure, a wearer opens the wrapping container 61 by tearing off a<br>
par: of the wrapping container 61 aiong the broken line 64 as shown in (C) of<br>
the same figure. Following this, as shown in (D) of the same figure, the wearer<br>
Inserts her index finger and middle finger of the left hand in the two respective<br>
finger cot parts provided on both side faces of the wrapping container 61, while<br>
she inserts her index finger of the right hand in the finger insertion opening 23 of<br>
the interlabial pad 2. In this state, she can take out the interlabial pad 2 from the<br>
wrapping container 61 by moving the right hand. Further as shown in (E) of the<br>
sections 61A and 61B apart along the separation edge 65 by opening the index<br>
finger and the middle finger of tne left hand to the left and right While opening<br>
the labia using these sections 61A and 61B. the wearer can put the interlabial<br>
pad fixed on the right hand at an appropriate position in the labia.<br><fourth embodiment><br>
Next, the wrapping container which itself serves as finger cots will be<br>
explained. Fig. 15 is a drawing for illustrating the wrapping container 71<br>
provided with a broken line 75 about in the longitudinal middle area; Fig. 16 is a<br>
sectional view taken along the arrow line E-E of Fig. 15; Fig 17 is a process<br>
drawing illustrating the state of fixing the sections 71A, 71B on the fingertips<br>
formed by separating the wrapping container 71 by opening it; Fig. 13 is a<br>
longitudinal sectional view of the wrapping body 73 containing the interlabia;<br>
pad 2 in folded state; Fig. 19 is a drawing for showing the wrapping body 73 in<br>
which the broken line 75 staring from one side part 71c of the wrapping<br>
container 71 is not extended up to the other side part 71d; and Fig. 20 illustrates<br>
the state in which the wrapping container of Fig.19 is separated from the broken<br>
line 75 and :s fixed on tne fingertips<br>
The wrapping body 73 shown in Fig. 15 is constructed by covering the<br>
interlabial pad 2 (not illustrated) provided with tne belt body 22. making both<br>
longitudinal end parts of the rectangular wrapping sheet overlap each other to<br>
form it into a cylindrical form, joining the overlapping parts of this wrapping body<br>
71 and the upper and lower edge ends, respectively, and enclosing the<br>
interlabial pad 2 therein. And, the wrapping container 71 is provided with a<br>
broken line 75 so as to be separated into two in the widthwise direction about in<br>
the lengthwise central region.<br>
The overlapping parts of the wrapping sheet are joined with a hot melt<br>
opened by heat-sealing ultrasonic sealing or a combination of heat-sealing and<br>
As shown in Fig 16. the wapping body 73 is formed by wrapping the belt<br>
and 22 with the interlabial pad 2 wrapping sheet in the lengthwise<br>
direction. Moreover the overlapping parts of the wrapping sheet is positioned<br>
on the opposite side to the body side on which the belt oody 22 is fixed in this<br>
embodiment, but may oe positioned on the body side.<br>
Moreover, it is preferable that both of the fore and aft end edges of the<br>
wrapping container 71 are roundly edged and not acute. If both of the fore and<br>
aft end edges are acute, the labia may be harmed, however, the form as<br>
mentioned above reduces stimulation to labia at the time of openirg the labia<br>
using the wrapping container 71.<br>
To open the wraoping container 71 forming the wrapping body 73 shown<br>
in (A) of Fig. 17, as shown in (3) of the same figure, the wrapping container 71<br>
;s firstly separated into the sections 71A and 71 B along the broken line 75 Thus<br>
me wrapping container 71 is opened, and the interiabial pad 2 is exposed.<br>
Therefore, as shown in Fig 17 (C). It is possible to hold the interiabial pad 2 on<br>
rearranged by inserting one index finger of the right hand in the finger insertion<br>
opening 23 And, when the wrapping container 71 is separated, the top and<br>
bottom parts 71a and 71b thereof are kept joined, therefore, the sections 71A<br>
and 71B are of a sack form. Therefore, as shown in (D) of the same figure, the<br>
sections 71A and 71B can be fixed on the fingertips like finger cots by inserting<br>
the fingers in the openings broken along the broken line 75, and when the<br>
interiabial pad 2 is fixed in the labia, the labia and the fingers are prevented<br>
from touching each other by opening the labia by the fingertips in such a state.<br>
Thus, the wrapping container 71 is used at the time of fixing the interlabial pad 2.<br>
waste thrown away as in the case of putting on finger puts separately.<br>
Moreover, as shown in Fig. 15, the interlabial pad 2 can be enclosed also<br>
in a folded stare. In this case, the interlabial pad 2 is preferred to be folded so<br>
that a half of the opposite side face to body side face, where the belt body 22 is<br>
attached approximately along the center line of the longitudinal axis, is faced to<br>
the other half thereof. By folding the interlabial pad as the above the wearer<br>
can visually check the body side for wearing the pad between the labia as soon<br>
as she opens the wrapping container 71, and she can wear the pad smoothly.<br>
As shown in Fig. 17 (A), the broken line 75 to be provided on the<br>
wrapping container 71 is arranged from one side part 71c toward the other side<br>
part 71d approximately in the longitudinal center of the wrapping container 71,<br>
however, as shown in Fig. 19, the broken line 75 starting from one edge part<br>
71c may be so arranged that it is not extended up to the other edge part 71d but<br>
ends in the neighborhood of the edge part 71d. In this case, to open the<br>
wrapping container 71, the break according to the broken line 75 is interrupted<br>
at the end point of the broken line 75, and as shown in Fig. 20. the wrapping<br>
container 71 is not completely separated until the wrapping container 71 has<br>
been put on the fingers.<br>
Moreover, the interlabial pad 2 (not illustrated) enclosed in the wrapping<br>
container is folded to be enclosed with the belt body 22 directed toward the end<br>
edge at the starting position of the broken line 75. Thus, the belt body 22 is<br>
automatically oriented in the direction visible to the wearer.<br>

illustrated a double-structured wrapping body in which tne inner wrapping body<br>
53A is arranged on the pocket portion 88 arranged in the cuter wrapping<br>
container 81B to form the outer wrapping body 83B; and Fig 25 shows a<br>
process drawing for illustrating a method for taking out the interlabial pad 2<br>
enclosed in the double-structured wrapping container and putting it on a finger.<br>
As shown in (A) of Fig 21, the inner wrapping body 83A directly enclosing<br>
the interlabial pad (not illustrated) is provided with a broken line 55 in the lateral<br>
direction, and the inner wrapping container 81A can be opened along this<br>
broken line 85. This inner wrapping body 83A (not illustrated) is arranged on the<br>
wrapping sheet 80, and as shown in (B) of the same figure, this inner wrapping<br>
body 83A is enwrapped in the wrapping sheet 80 in the lateral direction, and the<br>
wrapping parts of the wrapping sheet 80 and both of top and <br>
edges are joined to be peelable again. In this case, both of the top anc bottom<br>
end edges are joined so as not to be on the end edges of the inner wrapping<br>
body 33A (not illustrated).<br>
Then, the overlapping parts of the wrapping sheet 80 is sealed with a<br>
stop tape 84 provided on the wrapping sheet 80. This top tape 84 maintains the<br>
sealing state of the outer wrapping body 83B and also it is picked up at the time<br>
of unsealing it. Further, to throw away a used interlabial pad 2, the stop tape<br>
can be used as a means for re-sealing the used interlabial pad 2 where<br>
The outer wrapping container 81B can be provided with a pocket portion<br>
 86 More specifically, as shown in Fig 22, tne pocket portion 88 is formed by<br>
folding the wrapping sheet 30 inside, and joining cniy one side part 80d or both<br>
side parts of 80c are 80d in tne end part opposite to the end part where the<br>
step tape 84 of the wrapping sheet 80 is fixed. By forming the outer wrapping<br>
container 83B by thus folding the wrapping sheet 80 it becomes possible to<br>
enclose a used interlabial pad 2 (not illustrated and an inner wrapping<br>
container 81A (not illustrated) used as a finger cot in the pocket portion 86<br>
arranged in the outer wrapping container 81B beforehand, and this improves<br>
convenience for waste disposal more.<br>
When enclosing the inner wrapping body 85A in the outer wrapping<br>
container 81B having such a pocket portion 88, as shown in Fig. 23 (A), the<br>
inner wrapping body 83A is enclosed in the pocket portion 88 to form the outer<br>
wrapping body 83B by sealing the- outer wrapping container 81B with the stop<br>
tape 84, but the inner wrapping body 83A may be arranged on the pocket<br>
portion 88 as shown in Fig. 2- (A). When the inner wrapping body 85A is<br>
enclosed in the pocket portion 88, as shown in Fig. 22 (3), the pocket portion 88<br>
is positioned so as to envelope the interlabial pad 2 inside the outer wrapping<br>
body 53B, and when the inner wrapping body 83A is arranged on the pocket<br>

drawing illustrating the process of unfixing a used interlabial pad 2 by using the<br>
wrapping container 91 with the pocket portion 98.<br>
[Constitution of Wrapping Container]<br>
In the wrapping body 93 shown in Fig. 26, as shown in Fig. 27, the<br>
interlabial pad 2 folded along the longitudinal center line is enclosed in the<br>
pocket portion 98 formed by partly folding one end part of the wrapping sheet in<br>
the wrapping container 91 formed from a series of wrapping sheets. And further,<br>
the other end part is folded so as to overlap with the pocket portion 98, and the<br>
overlapping pat is joined to be peelable by a known technique such as<br>
a pre-opening pan 96 for unsealing the wrapping container 91.<br>
Moreover, the too and bottom end edges 91a. 91b are also joined to be<br>
peelable so as not to overlap with the enclosed interlabial pad 2. In order to<br>
strengthen this joining condition, not only known techniques such as<br>
heat-sealing and male-female embossing but also an adhesive can be used<br>
together. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 28, an adhesive is applied beforehand to<br>
the wrapping sheet in the neighborhood of the overlapping pre-opening part 96.<br>
The adhesive can be selected from hot-melt type adhesives without restriction,<br>
and is applied in a known application pattern in a form of plane, stripes, spiral,<br>
 etc. In such a manner, it is possible to surely eliminate a danger of<br>
exfoliation between the wrapping container 91 and the interlabial pad 2 when<br>
enclosing a used interlabial pad 2 which will be described later. Moreover, the<br>
interlabial pad 2 is stuck to the wrapping container 91 with the above adhesive<br>
applied in the wrapping container 91 before it is opened.<br>
Here, as obvious from Fig. 29, in the pocket portion 98, the interlabial pad<br>
2 is folded so that its rear face sheet faces each other, therefore, the belt body<br>
22 is positioned on the innermost plane. Moreover, since the folded part of the<br>
interlabia pad 2 is formed almost along the longitudinal center line, the finger is<br>
inserted in the interlabial pad 2 in the same direction as its crease, the wearer<br>
can easily hold the interlabial pad 2 on the fingertip at the time of wearing it. In<br>
this point, when the interlabial pad 2 is folded centering the lateral axis, the<br>
direction of the finger insertion and the crease differ in direction, therefore, the<br>
wearer has to open once the folded interlabial pad 2 before inserting the finger<br>
in the finger insertion opening 23, and this prevents the wearer from speedily<br>
and smoothly fixing the interlabial pad 2 on the finger.<br>
[Unsealed State]<br>
wearer can observe the belt body 22 at the same tine as she opens it, and as<br>
snown in Fig. 30, she can insert her ringer in ;he finger insertion opening in that<br>
state and can hold the interlabial pad 2 on the finger.<br>
Regarding this point when the pre-opening part 95 and the folded part of<br>
the interlabial pad 2 are positioned at the same place, the folded side of the<br>
interlabial pad 2 is obsen/ed by the wearer when she opens it, and rhe wearer<br>
has to turn the direction of the interlabial pad 2 to find the finger insertion<br>
opening 23 of the interlabial pad 2, this makes the action complex and a smooth<br>
wearing action is prevented.<br>
In contrast to the above, in this embodiment, it is possible to sanitariiy<br>
take out the interlabial pad 2 without contact between the body side of the<br>
interlabial pad 2 and the finger, and also the wearing direction is induced, and<br>
further, pushing pressure over the lengthwise direction for pushing the<br>
interlabial pad between the labia can be obtained at the stage when the<br>
interlabial pad 2 is secured. Namely, if the actions of inserting the finger in the<br>
finger insertion opening 23 and holding the interlabial pad on the fingertip are<br>
once performed, it is possible for the wearer to perform in that state a series of<br>
actions such as taking the interlabial pad 2 from the wrapping container 91,<br>
wearing it in labia, and pushing it to labia.<br>
[Disposal of Used interlabial Pad]<br>
To dispose of a used interlabial pad 2, the interlabial pad 2 is taken from<br>
between the labia firstly by, as shown in Fig. 31 (A), inserting the finger in the<br>
finger insertion opening of the interlabial pad 2 and holding it on the fingertip.<br>
Next, as shown in (B) of the same figure, a wearer inserts a finger holding the<br>
interlabial pad in the pocket portion 98 of the wrapping container 91, and<br>
pinches the interlabial pad 2 from outside of the wrapping container 91 by the<br>
right hand from the finger insertion opening 23, and as shown in (D) of the same<br>
figure she folds the wrapping sheet 90 and holds it on the pocket portion 95<br>
with a stop tape 94 for sealing it. This stop taoe 94 prevents the wrapping body<br>
98 from being unsealed when it is thrown away. Sealing means other than using<br>
the stop tape are application of an adhesive to the overlapping part, sticking a<br>
magic tape (a registered trade mark), a chuck arrangement for engaging the<br>
male and female parts with each other etc.<br>
Moreover, when a wearer takes out the interlabial pad from the labia, she<br>
can remove it also by pinching the belt body 22. Since the belt body 22 is<br>
positioned on opposite side face to body side face, the belt body 22 never<br>
comes into contact with absorbed menstrual blood, and the menstrual blood<br>
does net adhere to the finger of the wearer aiso at the time of removing the<br>
interlabial pad 2 from the labia.<br><seventh embodiment><br>
Next, a wrapping container having two unwrapped openings will be<br>
explained below. Fig. 32 illustrates a wrapping container 101 enclosing an<br>
nter:abial pad 210 having two finger insertion openings 213A and 213B<br>
The interlabial pad 210 is provided with two finger insertion openings<br>
213A and 213B to be chosen according to depths of labia of wearers (of. Fig.<br>
-17). The wrapping container 101 is provided with two pre-opening parts 106A<br>
and 106B corresponding to the two finger insertion openings of this interlabial<br>
pad 210. The characters of "shallow" and "deep" are added to the respective<br>
pre-opening parts as the marks for indicating which finger insertion opening is<br>
positioned therefore. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 32 (A), a wearer having a<br>
shallow depth of labia can select the pre-opening part 106A with the character<br>
'shallow" to open, and as shown, in Fig. 32 (B). a wearer having a deep depin of<br>
Thus, it is possible for a wearer to judge which pre-opening part to open even,<br>
from the outward looking of the wrapping contained 10<br><eighth embodiment></eighth>
Next, a wrapping container the opening direction of which is indicated by<br>
a pattern will be explained below. Fig. 33 illustrates tr.e wrapping container 11'I<br>
provided with a pattern 117.<br>
As shown ir Fig. 33, the wrapping container 111 can be provided with a<br>
pattern 117 having the top and bottom. In such a manner, not only fashionability<br>
is added to the wrapping container 111, but a wearer can understand the upper<br>
part at a glance where the pre-opening part 116 as an opening position is<br>
positioned.<br>
[Wrapping Container for Individually Packaging Sanitary Napkin with<br>
Pocket Portion for Enclosing Intarlabial Pad]<br>
Next, a wrapping container for individually packaging a sanitary napkin<br>
having a pocket portion for enclosing an interlabial pad will be explained below<br>
Fig. 34 is a drawing for illustrating a wrapping sheet 120 with a pocke' portion<br>
123 for enclosing a sanitary napkin therein: Fig. 35 is a process drawing<br>
instrating a method for enclosing the sanitary napkin 129 in a wrapping<br>
container 121 formed from a wrapping -sheet 120 to form a wrapping body 123;<br>
Fig. 36 is a section view taken along the arrowed line H-H of Fig. 35 (D); and<br>
Fig. 37 illustrates the wrapping sheet 120 after the wrapping container 121 has<br>
been opened and the sanitary napkin 129 has been taken out.<br>
In the wrapping sheet 120 for the sanitary napkin shown in Fig. 34. the<br>
pocket portion 128 is formed by folding one end part thereof, and joining both<br>
lengthwise overlapping edge parts of this folded part of the wrapping sheet 120<br>
by heat-sealing etc.<br>
and joining this on a part of the wrapping sheet 120. In this method,<br>
heat-sealing, ultrasonic sealing, hot-melt type adhesive, etc. can be used for the<br>
joining, and as for the material, a film, paper, non-woven fabric, etc. can be<br>
singly or compositely.<br>
When the sanitary napKin 129 is wrapped in the wrapping sheet 120, as<br>
shown I Fig. 35 (A), the wrapping sheet 120 is firstly placed with the pocket<br>
portion 128 up, and secondly, as shown in (B) of the same figure, the sanitary<br>
napkin 129 is placed thereon with its body side face faced to the sheet. Next, as<br>
shown in (C) of the same figure, the end part 12a of the wrapping sheet 120<br>
with the pocket portion 128 is folded inside together with the end part 129a of<br>
the sanitary napkin 129. Following this, as shown in (D) of the same figure, the<br>
other end part 120b of the wrapping sheet 120 and the other end part 129b of<br>
the sanitary napkin 129 are also folded inside And in order to maintain this<br>
folded state, a part 123 of the overlapping part, where the edge parts 120a and<br>
120b of the wrapping sheet 120 overlap with each other is temporarily tacked<br>
so as to be re-opened and sealed with a stop tape 124. Moreover, the edge<br>
parts 120c and 120d of the wrapping sheet 120 as the top and bottom ci the<br>
wearing container 121 are also temporary tacked by heat-sealing ultrasonic<br>
sealing, etc. so as to be re-opened. Thus, as shown in (E) of the same figure,<br>
the wrapping body 123 is formed.<br>
As shown in Fig. 36, the part in which only the wrapping sheet 120 is<br>
wrapped up is formed inside of the wrapping body 123. As shown in Fig. 34, this<br>
part is the pocket portion 128 which was already formed in the wrapping sheet<br>
120 before enclosing the sanitary napkin 129, and as shown in Fig. 37, it is<br>
possible to put the used interlabial pad 2 in this pocket 128 after the wrapping<br>
container 121 is opened.<br>
cleking up the step tape 12- first, pulling it to open one edge part 120b of the<br>
opening sheet 120 cutside. opening the temporarily tacked overlapping part<br>
125 and then opening also the other edge part 120a of the wrapping sheet 120<br>
 Thus, the wrapping container 121 is completely opened.<br>
Here, the direction in which the end part 120b of the wrapping container<br>
120 is pulled is opposite to the direction in which the pocket portion 123 is<br>
formed. Therefore, the putting action for opening the overlapping part 122 has<br>
 no influence on the pocket portion 123, and the pocket portion 123 is reduced in<br>
receiving damage.<br>
Moreover, in order to strengthen the maintenance state of the pocket<br>
portion 128, it is also possible to apply an adhesive only to the inside of the<br>
sealing part for forming the pocket portion 128 and reinforce the opening part of<br>
the pocket portion 128.<br>
Tne opposite side face to body side face of the sanitary napkin 129 is<br>
coated with an adhesive for being attached to an underwear. Therefore, the<br>
wraoping sheet 120 is provided with a peeling part on the part corresponding to<br>
the region coated with this adhesive, so that such an adhesive can be protected<br>
removable material tnereto such as removable paper and separate film, and the<br>
wrapping sheet itself may be provided with peeling treatment. When a<br>
removable material is attached, this material is preferred to be adhered to the<br>
wrapping sheet with an adhesive in advance. In such a manner, it becomes<br>
possible to prevent extra waste from being thrown away during the fixing action<br>
of the sanitary napkin 129 as in the case that the removable material separate<br>
from the wrapping sheet is stuck on an adhesive, and this improves the<br>
convenience of the action.<br>
The sanitary napkin which can be used in this embodiented is not to be<br>
restricted to a specific type but various types such as a type with wing and a<br>
rypes without wing and the likes can be applied.<br>
[Wrapping Body]<br>
Next, a wrapping body, in which the interlabial pad is enclosed so that the<br>
finger insertion opening of the interlabial pad is positioned in the neighborhood<br>
of the pre-opening part of the wrapping container, will be explained below<br>
Fig 33 iiiustrates a wrapping body 133 in which the interiabial pad 2 in<br>
accorcance with this embodiment is enclosed in the wrapping container 131 as<br>
it is, without being folded; Fig. 39 iiiustrates a wrapping body 143 enclosing tne<br>
interiabial pad 2 folded with the belt body 22 shaped like a chevron; Fig. 40<br>
illustrates a wrapping body 153 in which the interiabia: pad 2 is folded and<br>
enclosed in a wrapping container 151 to be opened in a doubie-door form; Fig.<br>
41 illustrates a wrapping body enclosing the interiabial pad 2 folded centering<br>
the lateral line, and a wrapping body enclosing the interlabial pad 2 with only a<br>
part of both sides folded.<br>
As shown in Fig. 33, when the interiabia! pad 2 is enclosed in such a<br>
wrapping container 131 as is opened by stripping the upper side 131a upward<br>
from the lower side 131b, the interiabial pad 2 is placed and enclosed therein<br>
with the belt body faced upward. Thus, a wearer is able to hold the irterlabial<br>
pad 2 on the fingertip by inserting the finger in the finger insertion opening 23<br>
immediately after the wrapping container 131 is opened. Moreover it is<br>
preferable that a marking 134 or the like is provided on the upper side 131a in<br>
order to clearly show the direct'on of stripping.<br>
In Fig. 33 mentioned above, the interiabial pad 2 is enclosed in the<br>
wrapping container 131 as it is, without being folded, however, it is also<br>
preferred to be folded for being enclosed so that the finger insertion opening 23<br>
a naturally opened when the wrapping container is unsealed. When the<br>
Interlabial pad 2 is folded, for example, as shown in Fig. 39 (A) the interlabial<br>
pad 2 can be enclosed in the wrapping container 141 with the which pad folded<br>
in a chevron shape. Moreover, as shown in (B) of the same figure, it is also<br>
possible to shape only the belt body 22 like a chevron, fold the main body<br>
side on the other hand for enclosing the pad in the wrapping container 1-1.<br>
Moreover, as shown in Fig. 40, even a wrapping container 151 to be unsesled<br>
by pulling both sides 151A and 151B toward left and right from the top (what is<br>
called a set of folding doors method), the interlabial pad 2 can enclose the<br>
interlabial pad therein with the belt body 22 folded.<br>
The folding mode of the interlabial pad 2 can be changed appropriately<br>
according to the wrapping containers, and it does not matte: whether the<br>
interlabial pad 2 is folded in half in the vertical direction as shown in Fig. 41 (A)<br>
cr only both side edge parts of tne interlabial pad 2 are folded as shown in Fig.<br>
41 (B).<br>
[Interlabial Pad]<br><basic configuration of interlabial pad><br>
The basic configuration of the interlabial pad in this embodiment will be<br>
explained below Fig. 42 is a schematic drawing of the body side of the<br>
interlabial pad 2, and Fig. 43 is a cross sectional view of the interlabial pad 2.<br>
Moreover, the interlabial pad 2 can be used for absorbing excretions (vaginal<br>
discharge) other than menstrual blood discharged from a ostium vaginae, and<br>
can also be used for absorbing urine discharged from an uretnral opening.<br>
namely, it can be used against incontinence of urine.<br>
The interlabial pad 2 in this embodiment is substantially an oblong form<br>
with a lateral dimension and a longitudinal dimension Moreover, the outline<br>
form is elliptic, but as long as it has such a shape as can preferably be held.<br>
and it can arbitrarily be selected from a rectangle, an oblong ellipse, a<br>
sandglass type. etc.<br>
As shown in Fig. 43. the interlabial pad is comprised of a body side<br>
surface in direct contact with the inside of labia and an opposite side face to<br>
body side face which is faced to the opposite side to the body side ot a wearer<br>
and is not in direct contact with the inside of labia. And, tne absorbent body 23<br>
is placed between a wafer permeable surface sheet 24 positioned on the bcay<br>
side and a water impermeable underside sheet 25 positioned on the opposite<br>
side face to body side face, and the surface sheet 24 and the underside sheet<br>
25 are joined to each other in the periphery of the absorbent body 26.<br>
And, a belt body 22, a mini-sheet piece for the interlabial pad, is attached<br>
on the side part of the opposite side face to body side face of the underside<br>
sheet 25 so as to traverse the interlabial pad 2 in the widthwise direction. A<br>
finger insertion opening 23 into which the finger can be inserted is formed<br>
between this belt body 22 and the underside sheet 25.<br>
In order for a wearer to easily discriminate the belt body 22, it can also be<br>
adjusted so as to differ in a color tone, a pattern, or chromaticity from the<br>
underside sheet or the interlabial pad by means of coloring, printing, etc.<br><other configurations of interlabial pad><br>
Next, the other configurations of the interlabial pad 2 will be explained<br>
below. Fig. 44 illustrates an interlabial pad 20 of a mid-upheaval structure in<br>
which the mid-area of the absorbent body 26 is upheaved; Fig. 45 illustrates an<br>
interlabial pad 200 made by putting two sheets together differing in the<br>
widthwise length; Fig. 46 illustrates an interlabial pad 210 consisting of two<br>
layers of a main sheet body 210A which can be fitted deep in the labia and a<br>
S':b-sheet 210B; and Fig. 47 illustrates a state in which the interlabial pad 210 is<br>
held on the finger<br>
In the interlabial pad 20 shown in Fig. 44, the absorbent body 25 is partly<br>
ucheaved in the widthwise center to increase adherence of the interlabial pad<br>
20 in the labia of a wearer. Therefore, it is possible to prevent menstrual bleed<br>
from leaking outside<br>
As to the interlabial pad 200 shown in Fig. 45. the actually sheet pad<br>
201 having a snorter widthwise length is laid on the body side surface of the<br>
ordinary interlabial pad 202, and both are joined together at the front and rear<br>
with an adnesive or heat-sealing, ultrasonic sealing, etc., or the overlapping part<br>
is joined to each other with an adhesive, or both joining methods are used<br>
together. This auxiliary sheet body 201 improves a body fluid absorbing ability<br>
of the interlabial pad. and thereby improves the effect of preventing menstrual<br>
blood from leaking.<br>
Further, the interlabial pad 210 shown in Fig. 46 is comprised of a main<br>
sheet body 210A and a sub-sheet body 210B, and both are joined together at<br>
each lengthwise edge part, and both are apart inside thereof, and further, in the<br>
widthwise direction, at least one of both sleeve parts is not joined. Therefore, a<br>
wearer can insert a finger into the two holes which are the first finger insertion<br>
opening 213A between the main sheet body 210A and the sheet pad, 210B<br>
and the second finger insertion opening 213B between the mini-sheet body 212<br>
for the interlabial pad and the sub-sheet body 210B. Therefore, the wearer is<br>
able to choose either of tnem according to her own depth of labia, and for<br>
example, a wearer with a shallow depth of labia inserts her finger from the first<br>
finger insertion opening 213A as shown in Fig. 47 (A), while a wearer with a<br>
deep depth of labia inserts her finger from the second finger insertion opening<br>
213B as shown in Fig. 47 (B).<br>
Moreover, the wrapping container for enclosing such an interlabial pad<br>
210 is preferred to be provided with the ore-opening parts at two places as the<br>
wrapping container 101 shown in Fig. 32. Moreover, when the interlabial pad<br>
210 is enclosed in the wrapping container 101, the finger insertion opening<br>
213A is positioned to the pre-opening part 106A with the character "shallow",<br>
and the finger insertion opening 2133 is positioned in the periphery of the<br>
pre-opening part 106B with the character "deep".<br>
[Construction Material of Wrapping Container]<br><wrapping sheet><br>
Known materials can ce used as the wrapping sheet for the wrapping<br>
container. For example, 15-60 micron polyethylene, polylpropyrene-polyester,<br>
polyvinyl-alcohol, poly-lactic acid, polybutyl-succinate, or non-woven fabric,<br>
paper, and laminated materials of these can be used. Specifically, a film<br>
consisting essentially of LDFE (low density polyethylene) resin adjusted to 15 -<br>
30g/mm2 specific weight per unit area is generally used.<br>
A laminated material of which the outside surface is composed of a film of<br>
non-woven fabric or paper can be used considering wiping property, liquid<br>
blocking property, etc. Specifically, a composite material can be used, on which<br>
a film consisting essentially of the LDPE resin adjusted 5 - 20g/m2 specific<br>
weight per unit area is laminated on one side of the composite non-woven fabric<br>
consisting of spun bond, melt blown, spun bond of 6 -10gsm 5 - 20gsm 6 -<br>
10gsm by weight.<br>
Moreover, when washing suitability is considered, non-woven fabric such<br>
as polybutylene-succinate, poly-lactic acid, polyisocyanate, starch can be used,<br>
and when the material is obtained from a film and water soluble, a film<br>
consisting essentially of polyvinyl-alcohol can be used, and use of toilet paper is<br>
also possible. Specifically, a laminated material of a polyvinyl-alcohol film<br>
adjusted to 5 - 10g/m2 specific weight per unit area and water soluble paper<br>
adjusted to 15 - 30g/m2 can be mentioned.<br>
The wrapping sheet can oe used also for wrapping a used interlabial pad<br>
and disposing of it when the interlabial pad is disposed of after use. In this case<br>
it is preferable that menstrual blood adhering to the interlabial pad or absorbed<br>
into it is prevented from oozing from the wrapping sheet, namely it is preferance<br>
that the menstrual blood is prevented from adhering to the finger when a wearer<br>
picks up the wrapping sheet wrapping the used interlabial pad. Therefore, a<br>
material rich in liquid blocking property, for example, a film consisting of about<br>
15 - 60 µm thick polyethylene, polypropylene, etc. or a laminated material<br>
obtained by laminating the raw materials for said film is recommenced for the<br>
use.<br>
Moreover, it is preferable that the wrapping sheet is able to shield the<br>
color of the menstrual blood adhering to or absorbed in the interlabial pad.<br>
To obtain such a shield effect, for example, the wrapping sheet is<br>
photogravured with an ink consisting of a 5 - 40wt% pigment, a 10 - 20 wt%<br>
resin, and a 40 - 85wt% solvent, or a sheet material opaqued by mixing a 0.2 -<br>
10wt% pigment in the raw material resin of the wrapping sheet is recommenced<br>
for the use. Otherwise, the wrapping sheet may oe dyed. The pigment for the<br>
use may be white or colored, for example, the following pigments can be used<br>
singly or in combination: C.l basic violet 3, etc. as basic dyes; C.1. vat blue 1<br>
etc. as vat dyes; blue 1, blue 2, C.l. acid red 51, etc. as acid dyes; C.l. direct<br>
yellow 12. C.l. direct orange 26. C.l. direct violet 51, C.l. direct blue 1, C.l. direct<br>
red 23, etc. as direct dyes; C.l reactive orange 16, C.l. reactive black 5, C.l<br>
reactive blue 21, CI. reactive red 21, etc. as reactive dyes; titanium oxide.<br>
titanium yellow, calcium carbonate, carbon black, ultramarine blue, etc. as<br>
inorganic pigments; and yellow 401, orange 204, blue 404, red 201, CI.<br>
pigment yellow 14, C.I. pigment green 7, CI. pigment violet 19, C.I. pigment<br>
clue 27. C.I. pigment red 166, etc. as organic pigments<br>
It is preferable that the ore-opening part and the overlapping part of the<br>
wrapping sheet forming the unsealing cart are made to be repealable and to<br>
prevent foreign matters from being mixed there. Such measures can be<br>
achieved by such known techniques as not only an arrangement of a stop tape<br>
to cover the overlapping part of the wrapping sheet, but also coating of a small<br>
quantity of an adhesive along me overlapping direction, joining by embossing,<br>
perforations provided inside of the area joined by embossing, etc.<br><mini-sheet piece for wrapping container><br>
A material used for the mini-sheet piece used for the wrapping container<br>
is preferred to be selected considering that the material has strength to be kept<br>
undamaged when a finger is inserted therein, and the material can be selected<br>
singly from among non-woven fabric, elastic nonwoven fabric film, foamed film,<br>
elastic film, foamed sheet, tissue paper, etc. or lamination of these. Preferred<br>
breaking strength of the material is at least 0.6N/inch lateral, and when<br>
considering the toughness, it is to be selected from a range of 0.6 - 2.5N/inch.<br>
Specifically, the material used is a film consisting essentially of an LDPE resin<br>
having a density of 0.915 adjusted to 15 - 30 µm in tnickness, and a foamed<br>
film can be mentioned as an especially preferable material which facilitates<br>
drawing a finger from the mini-sheet piece for the wrapping container, and<br>
consists essentially of an LDPE resin having capillaries, a density of 0.920, a<br>
volume of 0.3 - 1.0 mm, a 15 - 60% rate of hole area, and a 0.3 - 1.5 mm hole<br>
diameter.<br>
Moreover, tc provide the material with biodegradabilty and water washing<br>
capability, the synthetic resin composing said structure is replaced with<br>
biodegradable or water-soluble resin such as poly-lactic acid,<br>
polybutyl-succinate, PVA resin, etc. Further, a laminated material of tissue and<br>
said biodegradable or water-soluble resin can be used.<br>
It is also effective to provide said mini-sheet piece for the wrapping<br>
container with feasibility or elasticity in the widthwise direction of the underside<br>
sheet in order to allow a wearer to effectively use the interlabial pad related to<br>
the present invention irrespective of the fingertip size of the wears.<br>
in order to provide the mini-sheet piece for the wrapping container with<br>
elasticity, tensible spun bond non-woven fabric can be used, which has stress of<br>
0.1 - 0.5N/25mm at the time of 5% elongation when it is elongated with a 100<br>
mm knob distance, and a 100 mm/min constant stretching speec. Moreover, in<br>
order to provide the mini-sheet piece for the wrapping container with elasticity,<br>
elastic materials such as a fibrous sheet and film sheet using thermoplastic<br>
elastomer resin, thermoplastic elastomer resin itself, and crude rubber may<br>
singly be used or these may be combined with an inelastic material for the use.<br>
Moreover, in order to provide the mini-sheet piece with tensibility, the film<br>
consisting essentially of said LDPE can also be corrugated.<br><stop tape><br>
For the stop tape, known materials such as a film layer coated with an<br>
adhesive cr, one side, or tissue coated with an adhesive on one side when<br>
considering water washing capability, etc. can be used, and are rot to be<br>
restricted.<br>
[Inhibition Treatment of Number of Living Bacteria]<br>
It is more preferable from sanitary point of view to perform a treatment for<br>
suppressing the number of living bacteria in the individual wrapping container<br>
related to the present invention, especially in the part in contact with the<br>
interlabial pad and the handling member thereof. As the treatments for<br>
inhibiting the number of living bacteria, sterilizing treatment or germicidal<br>
treatment during production, use of antibacterial material for the individual<br>
wrapping container, etc. can be mentioned.<br>

be restricted whether the interlabial pad is singly used or it is used together with<br>
a sheet-like absorbent article such as a sanitary napkin and a panty liner, and<br>
also with a tampon, a pants-formed sanitary napkin, etc. Moreover, when the<br>
interlabial pad is used together with another sanitary article such as a sanitary<br>
napkin and tampon, such action as fixing the sanitary napkin to the underwear<br>
inserting the tampon in the ostium of vagina. etc. are performed before entering<br>

Moreover, when the interlabial pad is used together with another sanitan.<br>
article, the disposal process of such a sanitary article is added to the above<br>
procedure for the use.<br><information supply for the usage><br>
in order to prevent a wrong fixing method with regard tc the interlabial<br>
pad related tc the present invention, it is preferable to provide a wearer with the<br>
information on the usage as stated as above.<br>
Here, the following cases can be mentioned as wrong fixing methods of<br>
the interlabia! pad, for example: the interlabial pad is tried to be fixed laterally to<br>
the vulva slit; the interlabial pad is tried to be vertically inserted into the <br>
of vagina like a tampon; the interlabial pad is fixed with tne inside turned cut<br>
when; and the interlabial pad is not fitted inside of the labia but is placed as if<br>
were put on the surface of the sanitary napkin used together, in such, cases<br>
there is a fear of impairing the wear feeling inducing excessive leak<br>
menstrual blood or coming off of the interlabial pad from inside of the being of<br>
the wearer.<br>
With regard to the interlabial pad and the wrapping container related to<br>
the present invention, in order to prevent such wrong fixing, it is preferable that<br>
a wearer is correctly notified of the correct use procedures of the interlabial pad<br>
for its sufficient effect, and moreover, the wearer is clearly notified of the fixing<br>
method for being enabled to smoothly perform the wearing action<br>
As methods for supplying the information to wearers, the following<br>
methods can be mentioned, namely: the explanation of the usage is arranged in<br>
the individual wrapping container together with the inierlabial pad. the usage is<br>
printed on the surface and inner wall of the individual wrapping container:<br>
The description therefore is enclosed in the outer package; the usage is<br>
presented on a cooperative magazine together with the explanation of the<br>
article the usage is presented on a home page tnrough the Internet the usage<br>
is presented on a display rack of a shop together with the article the description<br>
therefore is enclosed m a sample article package; posting the description into<br>
tollets for women; oral explanation at a customers' clinic; etc. Preferable<br>
methods among such ones are those which can be confirmed by wearers every<br>
time they use it. namely an individual wrapping container is provided with the<br>
description of the usage therein together with the interlabial pad, and the usage<br>
is printed on the outer and inner surfaces of the individual wrapping container,<br>
and more preferable method is to enclose the description attached to the<br>
interlabial pads in the outer package of them<br>
A method for providing the individual wrapping container with tne<br>
description of the usage is, for example as shown in Fig. 43, through placing<br>
the description 163 inside of the wrapping sheet 160, and folding the description<br>
163 together with the wrapping sheet 160 at the time of enclosing the interlabial<br>
pad therein, to form them into the wrapping body 163. in such a manner, as<br>
shown in Fig. 49, when the wrapping container 161 is unsealed the description<br>
163 is exposed immediately, therefore, the description 158 surely attracts<br>
wearers notice when they use the interlabial pads.<br>
Moreover, as a method for printing the usage on the individual wrapping<br>
container, it is preferable to print it in the neighborhood of the pre-opening part<br>
for unsealing the individual wrapping container in order to prevent wearers from<br>
overlooking said printed part. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 50, numbers and<br>
symbols are used for inducing a sight line of a wearer so that the wearer is able<br>
to sequentially follow the usage according to the actions in which the wearer<br>
unfolds the folded wrapping sheet 190 and unseals the wrapping container 191.<br>
Moreover, the usage can be printed using pictures and sentences according to<br>
such numbers and symbols, however, only patterns may be used for the printing<br>
Moreover, it is preferable to print the sentences in the direction orthogonal to me<br>
opening direction. When the description of the usage is printed directly on the<br>
individual wrapping container so as to be faced to the front of the wearer, such a<br>
troublesome action can be omitted, as the description has to be thrown sway<br>
every time a wearer uses the interlabial pad, compared with the case in which<br>
the description is provided separately, and the fitting is more simplified.<br>
As a method for enclosing the description in the outer package, it is<br>
especially preferable that a box type outer package formed from a carton or a<br>
thermoplastic resin is provided with an entrance on the top for taking out the<br>
interlabial pad so that the description can be taken out immediately when such<br>
an entrance is opened.<br>
Moreover, it is also possible to sick the description on the top side<br>
(surface) or on the back side (inner surface) of the outer package, and to<br>
directly print the explanatory sentences and drawings on the top surface or on<br>
the inner surface of the outer package, or an the from face especially from<br>
upper face). In such a manner it becomes possible to let a wearer visual<br>
check the explanatory sentences and drawings every time she takes cut the<br>
interlabial pad individual wrapping body from the outer package.<br>
As an outer package, various shapes can be adopted from the view<br>
points such as wearers' preference and ease of use, easiness for the<br>
manufacturing process, and superiority and inferiority of the distribution. For<br>
example, using the outer packages as shown in Fig. 51 througn Fig. 56, the<br>
individual wrapping containers can be enclosed therein.<br>
Moreover, as an example of the description to be provided on the<br>
individual wrapping containers and the outer package, a combination of<br>
photographs and the explanatory sentences corresponding thereto can be<br>
mentioned as shown in Fig. 57.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As explained above, according to the present invention, when a wearer<br>
fixes or unfixes the interlabial pad, the wearer can makes use of the interlabial<br>
wrapping container. Therefore, it is possible for the wearer to perform such<br>
actions while preventing her fingers from coming in contact with the labia,<br>
without complicating the fixing and unfixing actions.<br>
Moreover, since the interlabial pad is enclosed in the interlabial pad<br>
individual wrapping container so that a finger can be inserted in the finger<br>
insertion opening of the interlabial pad immediately after the interlabial pad<br>
individual wrapping container is unsealed, the interlabial pad can be held on the<br>
fingertip quickly and smoothly, and the fixing and unfixing actions of the<br>
interlabial pad can also be performed quicker.<br>
