The following specification particularly describes<br>
the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
[Name of Document]  Specification [Title of the Invention]<br>
Power Unit Suspension Device for Scooter Type Vehicle<br>
[Technical Field] [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an improved power unit suspension device of a scooter type vehicle. [Background Art]<br>
[0002]<br>
A known traditional power unit suspension device of a scooter type vehicle is such that a power unit is connected to a vehicle body via a link mechanism (refer to, e.g. Patent Document 1) . [Patent Document 1]<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Sho 62-120288 [0003]<br>
A description will be made below with reference to Fig.6 in patent document 1.<br>
A first link 21 is attached at its one end to a main frame 8 via a support shaft 14 for swing upward and downward. A second link 31 is swingably attached at its one end to the other end of the first link 21. The rear portion of the vehicle body (power unit) 3 is joined<br><br>
swingably to the other end of the second link 31 with a bolt 42. [0004]<br>
The first link 21 has a longitudinal direction extending rearward and obliquely upward and is provided with bifurcate support pieces 28, 28. Rubber pieces 46, 4 6 are attached to the respective bifurcate support pieces 28, 28 to interpose between a cross member 12 and the bifurcate support pieces 28, 28. As the rubber pieces 46, 46 are compressed to deform, the upward and downward movement of the power unit 3 is restricted. When the rubber pieces soon reach the maximum-compressed deformation, the upward and downward movement of the power unit 3 is restricted. On the other hand, the second link 31 has its longitudinal direction extending rearward and obliquely downward. The first link 21 is formed with a projecting piece 44 and the second link 31 is provided with a lever 45, a shaft 49 passes through the projecting piece 44 and is joined to the lever 45 with a bolt nut 55, and compressive rubber pieces 47, 4 8 fitted loosely to the shaft 4 9 to put the projecting piece 44 there between. As the compressive rubber pieces 47, 48 are compressed to deform, the power unit 3 is allowed to move forward and rearward. When soon reaching the maximum compressive-<br><br>
deformation, the compressive rubber pieces 47, 4 8 restrict the forward and rearward movement of the power unit 3.<br>
[Disclosure of the Invention]<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
[0005]<br>
In the above-mentioned vehicle, the mechanism that restricts the upward and downward movement of the power unit 3 is disposed to mount on the first link 21, the mechanism that restricts the forward and rearward movement of the power unit 3 is disposed to mount on the first and second links 21, 31, and the mechanisms are composed of devices different from each other.  Therefore, the number of part components is increased and the structure is complicated, which increase costs.<br>
[0006]<br>
It is an object of the present invention to simplify a stopper structure which restricts the upward/downward and forward/rearward movements of a power unit and a rear wheel.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
[0007]<br>
The invention according to claim 1 is characterized<br>
in that an engine and a driving wheel are integrally<br><br>
connected to a power unit, which is swingably suspended by a vehicle body, first links are swingably connected at respective one ends thereof to the vehicle body and extend generally upward and downward so that a second link is swingably connected at one end thereof to each of the other ends of the first links, and the second link extends generally forward and backward so that the power unit is swingably connected to the other end of the second link; and in that a connecting rod is swingably attached at one end thereof to the vehicle body, the power unit is swingably attached to the other end of the connecting rod, a stopper mechanism which restricts forward and rearward movement of the power unit is attached to the vehicle body and connecting rod, a line segment extends upward and downward to connect a body side connection shaft with a power unit side connection shaft, both connection shafts being installed in the connecting rod, and the power unit side connection shaft is supported by the connecting rod via an elastic member. [0008]<br>
The connecting rod functions as follows: The connecting rod is swingably connected at one end thereof to the vehicle body, and the line segment connecting the body side connection shaft with the power unit side<br><br>
connection shaft extends upward and downward, both of the connection shafts being included in the connecting rod. The first link that is swingably connected at one end thereof to the vehicle body and extends generally upward and downward and the connecting rod permit the power unit to move forward and rearward.  In addition, the stopper mechanism restricts the forward and rearward movement of the power unit. When an upward and downward force is exerted on the connecting rod from the power unit, the second link and the elastic deformation of the elastic member included in the power unit side connection shaft permit the power unit to move upward and downward.  In addition, an increased elastic force that is generated by the deformation of the elastic member restricts the upward and downward movement of the power unit. [0009]<br>
The invention of the claim 2 is characterized in that the connecting rod is provided with a second vehicle side connection shaft between the body side connection shaft and the power unit side connection shaft, the power unit side connection shaft is connected to the power unit via an elastic member, and the second body side connection shaft is connected to the vehicle body via an elastic member.<br><br>
The elastic members function as follows:  The respective elastic members of the power unit side connection shaft and second body side connection shaft exhibit a damping function of absorbing the vibrations of the power unit. [0010]<br>
The invention of claim 3 is characterized in that the stopper mechanism includes a projection provided on the connecting rod and a notch provided in the vehicle body in order to insert the projection thereinto.<br>
The stopper mechanism functions as follows: When the power unit moves forward and backward, the projection of the connecting rod comes in abutment against the notch of the vehicle body to restrict the movement of the power unit.  For example, if the projection is worn away, the connecting rod is replaced by a new one. [0011]<br>
The invention according to claim 4 is characterized in that the stopper mechanism includes an elastic member secured to an end of an extension extending from the body side connection shaft of the connecting rod, in a direction different from that of the power unit side connection shaft; and a restricting portion provided on the vehicle body in order to abut against the elastic<br><br>
member. [0012]<br>
The stopper mechanism functions such that, when the power unit moves forward or backward, the elastic body secured to the end of the extension of the connecting rod will abut against the restricting portion, which restricts the movement of the power unit while exhibiting damping and vibration-proofing capability. [0013]<br>
The invention of claim 5 is characterized in that a main stand is provided below the power unit.<br>
The main stand provided below the power unit functions as follows:  In the case of the conventional link mechanism provided with a single or a plurality of elastic members, forces exerted on the above-mentioned elastic member(s) are different in direction between a state of a main stand provided below the power unit being raised and a state of a driving wheel being in contact with the ground, that is, of the main stand being stored. Therefore, vibrations of the power unit in the state of the main stand being raised may more tend to propagate to the vehicle body than in the state of the driving wheel being in contact with the ground.  In the present invention, however, the vibrations of the power unit can<br><br>
be absorbed by the damping functions of the plural elastic members included in the connecting rod even in the state of the main stand provided below the power unit being raised.<br>
[0014]<br>
The invention of claim 6 is characterized in that the elastic members are each composed of a rubber bushing and a rubber bushing of the power unit side connection shaft is provided with hole portions located above and below the power unit side connection shaft so as to provide a characteristic softer in an upward and downward direction than in the forward and rearward direction of the vehicle body.<br>
[0015]<br>
The rubber bushing of the power unit side connection shaft functions as follows:  Since the rubber bushing is provided with hole portions above and below the power unit side connection shaft, when the power unit vibrates upward and downward, the hole portions are easily deformed, thus, making it easy to absorb the upward and downward vibrations.<br>
[0016]<br>
The invention of claim 7 is characterized in that the elastic members are each composed of a rubber bushing<br><br>
and a rubber bushing of the second body side connection shaft is provided with hole portions located forward of and rearward of the second body side connection shaft so as to provide a characteristic softer in the forward and rearward direction of the vehicle body than in the upward and downward direction. [0017]<br>
The rubber bushing of the second body side connection shaft functions as follows:  Since the rubber bushing is provided with the hole portions forward of and rearward of the second body side connection shaft, when the power unit vibrates forward and backward, the hole portions are easily deformed, thus, making it easy to absorb the forward and backward vibrations. [0018]<br>
The invention of the claim 8 is characterized in that a line segment connecting the body side connection shaft with the second body side connection shat and a line segment connecting the second body side connection shaft with the power unit side connection shaft form a dogleg. [0019]<br>
The axes connecting the connection shafts of the connecting rod function as follows:  It is possible to<br><br>
locate the power unit side connection shaft rearward of the extension of the line segment connecting the body side connection shaft with the second body side connection shaft with respect to the vehicle body. As a result, it becomes possible to make the power unit side connection shaft apart from the vehicle body. [0020]<br>
The invention of claim 9 is characterized in that the connecting rod is single and is provided only on one side of the vehicle body.<br>
The location of the connecting rod functions as follows: Since the single connecting rod is provided only on one side of the vehicle body, the number of part components is reduced compared with a pair of left and right connecting rods provided on both sides of the vehicle body, for instance, resulting in a simplified link mechanism. [0021]<br>
The invention of claim 10 is characterized in that the connecting rod is made by forging.<br>
The connecting rod functions as follows:  Since the connecting rod is formed by forging, the connecting rod is increased in strength.  If ensuring a desired strength, the connecting rod can be reduced in weight compared with<br><br>
that made of the same material by casting, for instance. [0022]<br>
Then invention of claim 11 is characterized in that the power unit side connection shaft is supported by a plurality of connection supporting portions attached to the second link, and the connecting rod is joined to the power unit side connection shaft so as to be placed between a first connection supporting portion and a second connection supporting portion of the connection supporting portions, the second connection supporting portion being located outward of the first connection supporting portion with respect to the vehicle body. [0023]<br>
The support structure of the connecting rod functions as follows: The power unit side connection shaft installed in the connecting rod is supported by the first and second connection supporting portions located both sides of the connecting rod; therefore, a portion supporting the connecting rod via the power unit side connection shaft is increased in rigidity. [0024]<br>
The invention according to claim 12 is characterized in that the elastic member interposed between the power unit side connection shaft and the<br><br>
connecting rod is provided at a plurality of locations, the elastic members are arranged in an axial direction, and a restricting means is provided between the plurality of elastic members in order to set a flexible volume to a value not greater than a predetermined value.<br>
The restricting means functions to set the flexible volume of the elastic members disposed between the power unit side connection shaft and the connecting rod and arranged in an axial direction, to a value not greater than a predetermined value. [Effects of the Invention] [0025]<br>
In the invention of claim 1, the connecting rod is swingably connected at one end thereof to the vehicle body, the power unit is swingably connected to the other end of the connecting rod, the stopper mechanism is attached to the vehicle body and connecting rod in order to restrict the forward and backward movement of the power unit, the line segment is extended upward and downward to connect the body side connection shaft with the power unit side connection shaft, both the connection shafts being installed in the connecting shaft, and the power unit side connection shaft is supported by the connecting rod via the elastic member.  Therefore, while<br><br>
the stopper mechanism restricts the forward and backward movement of the power unit, an elastic force resulting from the deformation of the elastic member of the power unit side connection shaft installed in the connecting rod can restrict the upward and downward movement of the power unit. More specifically, while the two-directional<br>
moveability^ i.e. forward/rearward and upward/downward moveability, of the power unit can be enabled, the forward/backward and upward/downward movements of the power unit can be restricted by the connecting rod.  This simplifies the stopper structure and reduces the number of part components, resulting in reduced costs. [0026]<br>
In the invention of claim 2, the connecting rod has the second body side connection shaft located between the body side connection shaft and the power unit side connection shaft, the power unit side connection shaft is connected to the power unit via the elastic member, and the second body side connection shaft is connected to the vehicle body. Therefore, the damping function is improved compared with provision of a single elastic member, thereby making it possible to absorb greater vibrations. [0027]<br>
In the invention of claim 3, the stopper mechanism<br><br>
includes a projection provided on the connecting rod and a notch provided in the vehicle body in order to insert the projection there into. Therefore, when the projection needs to be replaced by a new one because of wear or the like, not only replacement becomes easier compared with a conventional projection attached to the power unit but also the stopper mechanism can be attached with a simple structure. [0028]<br>
In the invention according to claim 4, the stopper mechanism includes an elastic member secured to an end of an extension extending from the body side connection shaft of the connecting rod, in a direction different from that of the power unit side connection shaft; and a restricting portion provided on the vehicle body in order to abut against the elastic member. Therefore, varying the shape or hardness of the elastic member can easily adjust the forward and rearward swing of the power unit while exhibiting damping and vibration-proofing effects. Further, when intending to ensure the large swing, it is easy to cope with the intention. [0029]<br>
In the invention of claim 5, since the main stand is provided below the power unit, even in the state of<br><br>
the main stand being raised, it is possible to make it easy to absorb the vibrations of the power unit due to improvement of the damping function of the three elastic members installed in the connecting rod. This can reduce vibrations propagating to the vehicle body. [0030]<br>
In the invention of claim 6, the elastic members are each composed of a rubber bushing and a rubber bushing of the power unit side connection shaft is provided with hole portions located above and below the power unit side connection shaft so as to provide a characteristic softer in an upward and downward direction than in the forward and backward direction of the vehicle body. Therefore, the rubber bushing of the power unit side connection shaft positively absorbs, with a simple structure, vibrations resulting from the upward and downward movement of the power unit. This enables to make the upward and downward vibrations of the power unit less propagative to the body frame. [0031]<br>
In the invention of claim 7, the elastic members are each composed of a rubber bushing and a rubber bushing of the second body side connection shaft is provided with hole portions located forward of and<br><br>
rearward of the second body side connection shaft so as to provide a characteristic softer in the forward and rearward direction of the vehicle body than in the upward and downward direction. Therefore, the rubber bushing of the second body side connection shaft positively absorbs, with a simple structure, the vibrations resulting from the forward and backward movement of the power unit. This enables to make the forward and backward vibrations of the power unit less propagative to the body frame.<br>
[0032]<br>
In the invention of claim 8, the line segment connecting the body side connection shaft with the second body side connection shat and the line segment connecting the second body side connection shaft with the power unit side connection shaft form a dogleg. Therefore, the power unit side connection shaft can be located so as to be apart from the vehicle body. This causes the power unit side connection shaft to have a large swing while preventing the connecting rod from interfering with the vehicle body.<br>
[0033]<br>
In the invention of claim 9, since the connecting rod is single and is provided on only one side of the vehicle body, the link mechanism can be simplified to<br><br>
reduce the number of part components, resulting in reduced costs.<br>
[0034]<br>
In the invention of claim 10, since it is made by forging, the connecting rod can be reduced in weight while the projection of the stopper mechanism can be formed with a high degree of strength.<br>
[0035]<br>
In the invention of claim 11, the power unit side connection shaft is supported by a plurality of connection supporting portions attached to the second link, and the connecting rod is joined to the power unit side connection shaft so as to be placed between a first connection supporting portion and a second connection supporting portion of the connection supporting portions, the second connection supporting portion being located outward of the first connection supporting portion with respect to the vehicle body. Therefore, the connecting rod is supported so as to be placed between the first connecting support portion and the second connecting support portion, which increases the strength of a portion supporting the connecting rod. This makes it possible to surely exhibit the effect of the connecting rod.<br><br>
[0036]<br>
In the invention according to claim 12, the elastic member interposed between the power unit side connection shaft and the connecting rod is provided at a plurality of locations, the elastic members are arranged in an axial direction, and a restricting means is provided between the plurality of elastic members in order to set a flexible volume to a value not greater than a predetermined value. Therefore, the flexible volume of the elastic members can be set with a simple structure and varying the shape of the restricting means can vary the flexible volume freely, which can increase the degree of freedom of design.<br>

The connecting rod 84 is swingably connected to the inner pivot plate 31b via the third pivot shaft 93, and is connected at its rear end to the fourth pivot shaft 94. The intermediate shaft 95 connects the inner pivot plate 31b with the intermediate portion of the connecting rod 84. [0048]<br>
Fig. 4 is a perspective view (the first embodiment)<br><br>
of the link mechanism according to the present invention. The link mechanism 55 primarily includes the first links 81, 81, the second pivot shaft 92, the second link 82, the third pivot shaft 93, the connecting rod 84, the fourth pivot shaft 94, and the intermediate shaft 95. More specifically, the link mechanism 55 includes a front upper connecting mechanism 101 which connects the first pivot shaft 28 with the first links 81; and a front lower connecting mechanism 102 which connects the first links 81 with the second pivot shaft 92.  These front upper connecting mechanism 101 and front lower connecting mechanism 102 will be detailed later.<br>
[0049]<br>
Fig. 5 is a perspective view (the first embodiment) of a stopper mechanism of the link mechanism according to the invention. A notch 31c open downward is formed at a rear lower portion of the pivot plate 31, specifically, of the inner pivot plate 31b, and at a position forward of and obliquely downward of the intermediate shaft 95. A projection 84a is formed in the inner surface of the connecting rod 84 so as to project upward and go into the notch 31c. Such a notch 31c and projection 84a constitute a stopper mechanism 105.<br>
[0050]<br><br>
The notch 31c includes a front edge 31j, a rear edge 31k and an upper edge 31m. Abutment of the projection 84a against the front edge 31j or rear edge 31k restricts the forward and rearward swing of the connecting rod 84 with respect to the inner pivot plate 31b.<br>
[0051]<br>
Fig. 6 is a side view (the first embodiment) illustrating an essential portion of the link mechanism according to the invention. The first link 81 extends generally upward and downward, the second link 82 extends generally forward and rearward, specifically, rearward and slightly rearward-upward, and the connecting rod 84 extends generally upward and downward.  Since the second link 82 moves forward and rearward with respect to the first pivot shaft 28 and the third pivot shaft 93, the link mechanism 55 configures a parallel link in which the first link 81 and the connecting rod 84 are substantially parallel to each other. That is to say, the first links 81 and the connecting rod 84 permit the power unit 56 to move forward and rearward.<br>
[0052]<br>
In addition, the second link 82 extends substantially forward and rearward and swings around the<br><br>
second pivot shaft 92 and the fourth pivot shaft 94 is elastically supported on the side of the connection rod 84, whereby the power unit 56 can be permitted to move upward and downward. [0053]<br>
Fig. 7 is a side view (the first embodiment) of the link mechanism according to the present invention.  The connecting rod 84 of the link mechanism 55 is a member that is configured to have through-holes 84b, 84c and 84d bored at an upper end portion, a lower end portion and an intermediate portion thereof so as to connect with the third pivot shaft 93, the fourth pivot shaft 94 and the intermediate shaft 95, respectively, therethrough.  In addition, rubber bushings 111, 112, 113 are fitted into the through-holes 84b, 84c and 84d, respectively. [0054]<br>
The rubber bushing 111 includes: an inner cylinder 115 fitted into the third pivot shaft 93; an outer cylinder 116 provided outside the inner cylinder 115 to fit into the through-hole 84b; and rubber 117 adhered to the inner cylinder 115 and outer cylinder 116. [0055]<br>
The rubber bushing 112 includes: an inner cylinder 121 fitted into the fourth pivot shaft 94; an outer<br><br>
cylinder 122 provided outside the inner cylinder 121 to fit into the through-hole 84c; and rubber 123 adhered to the inner cylinder 121 and outer cylinder 122.<br>
Reference numerals 123a and 123b in the figure denote circular hole portions which are bored in the rubber 123 at upper and lower portions, respectively, of the inner cylinder 121 in order to cause the rubber 123 to easily transform upward and downward. [0056]<br>
The rubber bushing 113 includes: an inner cylinder 126 fitted onto the intermediate shaft 95; an outer cylinder 127 provided outside the inner cylinder 126 to fit into the through-hole 84d; and rubber 12 8 adhered to the inner cylinder 126 and outer cylinder 127.<br>
Reference numerals 12 8a and 12 8b in the figure denote hole portions which are bored in the rubber 12 8 forward and rearward, respectively, of the inner cylinder 126 in order to cause the rubber 12 8 to easily transform upward and downward. [0057]<br>
Assumption is made as follows: A line segment that connects an axle 93a (the axle 93a is denoted with a black circle) of the third pivot shaft 93 and an axle 95a (the axle 95a is denoted with a black circle) of the<br><br>
intermediate shaft 95 is referred to as reference numeral 131. A line segment that connects an axle 95a of the intermediate shaft 95 and an axle 94a (the axle 94a is denoted with a black circle) of the fourth pivot shaft 94 is referred to as reference numeral 132. A line segment that connects the axle 93a of the third pivot shaft 93 and the axle 94a of the fourth pivot shaft 94 is referred to as reference numeral 133. The line segment 132 is inclined toward the rear side of the vehicle at an angle<br>
of 9 relative to the line segment 131. The line segments 131 and 132 are formed like a dogleg. That is to say, the fourth pivot shaft 94 is displaced toward the backside of the vehicle with respect to the third pivot shaft 93 and the intermediate shaft 95; therefore, the fourth pivot shaft 94 and its associated peripheral components can be largely displaced backward and forward, and upward and downward without interference with the body side components, specifically, the pivot plates 31, 32 (see Fig. 3) and the pivot frames 33, 34 (see Fig. 3). [0058]<br>
Fig. 8 is a cross-sectional view taken along line 8-8 of Fig. 6. The front upper connecting mechanism 101 connects the first pivot shaft 28 with the first links 81. This connecting mechanism 101 includes a left cylinder<br><br>
portion 141, a right outer cylinder portion 142, a right inner cylinder portion 143, an inner cylinder 144, needle bearings 146, 147, an outer cylinder 148, an end plate 152, and an end plate 154. The left cylindrical portion 141 is joined to the pivot plate 31 so as to pass therethrough and is provided with a hollow portion 141a adapted to insertably receive the first pivot shaft 28 therein.  The right outer cylinder portion 142 is joined to the pivot plate 32 so as to pass therethrough.  The right inner cylinder portion 14 3 is threadedly joined to the right outer cylinder portion 14 2 and is provided with a hollow portion 143a adapted to insertably receive the first pivot shaft 28. The inner cylinder 144 is provided with a hollow portion 144a adapted to insertably receive the first pivot shaft 28.  The needle bearings 146, 147 are fitted onto the outer circumferential surfaces of both ends of the inner cylinder 144.  In order to fit the needle bearings 146, 147 in that way, the outer cylinder 148 is formed, at both ends of the hollow portion 148a, with inner circumferential surfaces 148b, 148c that have an inner diameter greater than the hollow portion 14 8a. The end plate 152 abuts against one end face of the inner cylinder 144, has a dust seal 151 attached thereto to prevent dust and the like from entering the needle<br><br>
bearing 146, and is formed with an insertion hole 152a to receive the first pivot shaft 28. The end plate 154 abuts against the other end face of the inner cylinder 144, has a dust seal 153 attached thereto to prevent dust and like from entering the needle bearing 147, and is formed with an insertion hole 154a to receive the first pivot shaft 28. The first links 81, 81 are joined to the outer circumferential surfaces of both ends of the outer cylinder 14 8 by welding.  Thus, the outer cylinder 14 8 is turned with respect to the inner cylinder 144 via the needle bearings 146, 147, which swings the first links 81, 81 with respect to the first pivot shaft 28.  Incidentally, reference numeral 156 denotes a nut joined threadedly to the external thread of a bolt-like end of the first pivot shaft 28. [0059]<br>
The front lower connecting mechanism 102 connects the first links 81, 81 with the second pivot shaft 92. This connecting mechanism 102 includes an inner cylinder 161, needle bearings 162, 163, an outer cylinder 164, an end plate 167, and another end plate 169. The inner cylinder 161 is provided with a hollow portion 161a adapted to insertably receive the second pivot shaft 92. The needle bearings 162, 163 are fitted onto the outer<br><br>
circumferential surfaces of both ends of the inner cylinder 161.  In order to fit the needle bearings 162, 163 in that way, the outer cylinder 164 is formed, at both ends of the hollow portion 164a, with inner circumferential surfaces 164b, 164c that have an inner diameter greater than the hollow portion 164a.  The end plate 167 abuts against one end face of the inner cylinder 161, has a dust seal 166 attached thereto to prevent dust and the like from entering the needle bearing 162, and is formed with an insertion hole 167a to receive the second pivot shaft 92 therein.  The end plate 16 9 abuts against the other end face of the inner cylinder 161, has a dust seal 168 attached thereto to prevent dust and like from entering the needle bearing 163, and is formed with an insertion hole 169a to receive the second pivot shaft 92 therein. Thus, the outer cylinder 164 is turned with respect to the inner cylinder 161 via the needle bearings 162, 163, which swings the second link 82 (see Fig. 6) with respect to the second pivot shaft 92.  Incidentally, reference numeral 81a denotes a bolt insertion hole formed on the first link 81 to pass the second pivot shaft 92 therethrough, and 171 denotes a nut joined threadedly to the external thread of a bolt-like end of the second pivot shaft 92.<br><br>
[0060]<br>
Fig. 9 is a cross-sectional view (the first embodiment) taken along line 9-9 of Fig. 6.  The second link 82 includes a left arm 175 and right arm 176, an intermediate connection pipe 177, and an end arm 178.  The left and right arms 175, 176 are welded to the outer cylinder 164 so as to be apart from each other as they go rearward.  The intermediate connection pipe 177 is joined to the respective intermediate portions of the left and right arms 175, 176 so as to extend in a vehicle-widthwise direction. The end arm 178 is joined to a projecting end of the intermediate connection pipe 177 that is located on the leftward-outside of the left arm 175. The left arm 175, the right arm 176 and the end arm 178, which are three connection support portions, support the fourth pivot shaft 94. [0061]<br>
The connecting rod 84 is located between the left arm 175 (which is a first connection support portion) and the end arm 178 (which is a second connection support portion) and carried by the left arm 175 and the end arm 178 via the fourth pivot shaft 94. Therefore, rigidity of the portion for supporting the connecting rod 84 can be increased.  Incidentally, reference numerals 62a, 62b<br><br>
denote link connecting portions which are provided on the crankcase 62 of the power unit 56 so as to project forward. [0062]<br>
Fig. 10 is a cross-sectional view (the first embodiment) taken along line 10-10 of Fig. 6, illustrating connection of the link connecting portions 62a, 62b of the power unit 56 to the fourth pivot shaft 94 via the rubber bushings 181, 181. [0063]<br>
The rubber bushing 181 includes: an inner cylinder 184 formed with a hollow portion 184a to insertably receive the fourth pivot shaft 94; an outer cylinder 185 fitted into a through-hole 62c bored in the link connecting portion 62a or into a through-hole 62d bored in the link connecting portion 62b; and rubber 186 adhered to the inner cylinder 184 and the outer cylinder 185.  Incidentally, reference numerals 31e and 31f denote bolt insertion holes bored in the inner pivot plate 31b to pass the third pivot shaft 93 therethrough, and 31g and 31h denote bolt insertion holes bored in the inner pivot plate 31b to pass the intermediate shaft 95 therethrough. Reference numeral 191 denotes a nut joined threadedly to the external thread of the end of the third<br><br>
pivot shaft 93, 192 denotes a nut joined threadedly to the external thread of an end of the fourth pivot shaft 94, and 193 denotes a nut joined threadedly to the external thread of an end of the intermediate shaft 95. Reference numeral 194 denotes a collar spanned between the left and right rubber bushings 181, 181 to pass the fourth pivot shaft 94 therethrough. [0064]<br>
The connecting rod 84 is configured such that the through-hole 84c adapted to support the fourth pivot shaft 94 is disposed nearer to the body-widthwise central point than the through-holes 84b and 84d adapted to support the third pivot shaft 93 and the intermediate shaft 95, respectively, that is, the lower end of the connecting rod 84 is located near the body-widthwise central point. Therefore, the bank of angle can be increased. [0065]<br>
A description will be next made of the function of the stopper mechanism 105 described above.<br>
Figs. 11(a) and (b) are function diagrams (the first embodiment) illustrating the function of the stopper mechanism according to the present invention. Note that the imaginary lines in the figures denote a<br><br>
state before movement or swing.<br>
In Fig. 11(a), for example, when the power unit 56 moves toward the front of the vehicle body as shown by an outline arrow, the connecting rod 84 swings around the third pivot shaft 93 in the direction of an arrow to cause the rubber bushings 112, 113 to yield.  Soon the connecting rod 84 stops due to the reaction force of the rubber.  However, if the forward swing angle of the connecting rod 84 is further increased, the rubber bushings 112, 113 yield largely to cause a projection 84a provided on the connecting rod 84 to come into abutment against the front edge 31j of the notch 31c on the side of the pivot plate 31. As a result, the connecting rod 84 stops swinging relative to the pivot plate 31. [0066]<br>
In Fig. 6(b), for example, when the power unit 56 moves the rear of the vehicle body as shown by an outline arrow, the connecting rod 84 swings around the third pivot shaft 93 in the direction an arrow to cause the rubber bushings 112, 113 to yield.  Soon the connecting rod 84 stops due to the reaction force of the rubber. However, if the rearward swing angle of the connecting rod 84 is further increased, the rubber bushings 112, 113 yield largely to cause the projection 84a of the<br><br>
connecting rod 84 to come into abutment against the rear edge 31k of the notch 31c on the side of the pivot plate 31. As a result, the connecting rod 84 stops swinging relative to the pivot plate 31. [0067]<br>
Figs. 12(a) and (b) are function diagrams (the first embodiment) illustrating the functions of the stopper mechanism and the stopper structure based on the connecting rod according to the present invention. Note that the imaginary lines in the figures denote a state before movement or swing.<br>
In Fig. 12(a), for example, when the power unit 56 moves upward as shown by an outline arrow, the fourth pivot shaft 94 moves upward to swing the second link 82 around the second pivot shaft 92 in the direction of an arrow. This swing causes the rubber bushing 112 of the connecting rod 84 to yield largely, increasing the upward movement of the fourth pivot shaft 94, which causes the inner cylinder 121 of the rubber bushing 112 to approach the outer cylinder 122. As a result, the rubber 123 between the inner cylinder 121 and the outer cylinder 122 is largely compressed to generate a large elastic force. This elastic force stops a rise of the fourth pivot shaft 94 relative to the connecting rod 84.  Incidentally, the<br><br>
*<br>
upward bending of the rubber bushings 111, 113 of the connecting rod 84 is extremely small compared with that of the rubber bushing 112; therefore, the positional relationship between the pivot plate 31 and the connecting rod 84 remains substantially unchanged.  It can be, thus, said that the upward travel distance of the power unit 56 is substantially equal to that of the fourth pivot shaft 94 relative to the connecting rod 84. [0068]<br>
In Fig. 12(b), when the power unit 56 moves downward as shown by an outline arrow, the fourth pivot shaft 94 moves downward to swing the second link 82 around the second pivot shaft 92 in the direction of an arrow. This swing causes the rubber bushing 112 of the connecting rod 84 to yield largely, increasing the movement of the fourth pivot shaft 94, which causes the inner cylinder 121 of the rubber bushing 112 to approach the outer cylinder 122. As a result, the rubber 123 between the inner cylinder 121 and the outer cylinder 122 is largely compressed to generate a large elastic force. This elastic force stops a lowering of the fourth pivot shaft 94 relative to the connecting rod 84.  Incidentally, the downward bending of the rubber bushings 111, 113 of the connecting rod 84 is extremely small compared with<br><br>
that of the rubber bushing 112; therefore, the positional relationship between the pivot plate 31 and the connecting rod 84 remains substantially unchanged.  It can be, thus, said that the downward travel distance of the power unit 56 is substantially equal to that of the fourth pivot shaft 94 relative to the connecting rod 84. [0069]<br>
Fig. 13 is a third perspective view (a second embodiment) illustrating a body frame central portion and a link mechanism according to the present invention. A pivot plate 231 including an outer pivot plate 231a and an inner pivot plate 231b is attached to a main frame 26 and a pivot frame 33 both disposed on the left-hand side. A pivot plate 232 is attached to a main frame 27 and a pivot frame 34 both disposed on the right-hand side. A first pivot shaft 28 is connected to the outer pivot plate 231a and the pivot plate 232.  First links 81, 81 are attached to the first pivot shaft 28 and a second link 234 is swingably attached to the first links 81, 81 via a second pivot shaft 92 (not shown). A fourth pivot shaft 94 is connected to the rear end of the second link 234. A connecting rod 236 is swingably connected to the outer pivot plate 231a and the inner pivot plate 231b via a third pivot shaft 233.  The connecting rod 236 is<br><br>
swingably connected at its lower end to a fourth pivot shaft 94.  Stopper rubber 237 attached to the upper end of the connecting rod 236 is disposed between the main frame 26 and a rear wall 231c of the inner pivot plate 231b.<br>
[0070]<br>
A power unit 56 (see Fig. 1) is supported by the main frames 26, 27 and the pivot frames 33, 34 mentioned above in such a manner as to be swingable through a link mechanism 24 0.<br>
The first pivot shaft 28, the link mechanism 240 and a rear cushion unit 58 (see Fig. 1) constitute a power unit suspension device 16B (see Fig. 15) for suspending the power unit 56 (see Fig. 1).<br>
[0071]<br>
Fig. 14 is a perspective view (the second embodiment) of the link mechanism according to the present invention.  The link mechanism 24 0 mainly includes the first links 81, 81, the second pivot shaft 92, the second link 234, the third pivot shaft 233, the connecting rod 236, and the fourth pivot shaft 94. More specifically, the link mechanism 240 includes a front upper connection mechanism 101 which connects the first pivot shaft 28 and the first links 81, and a front lower connection mechanism 102 which connects the first links<br><br>
81 and the second pivot shaft 92.<br>
The second link 234 is composed of a left arm 241 and a right arm 242 attached to an outer cylinder 164 and the left and right arms 241 and 242 hold the fourth pivot shaft 94. [0072]<br>
Fig. 15 is a side view (the second embodiment) illustrating an essential portion of the link mechanism according to the present invention. The first link 81 extends in a substantially up-and-down direction and the second link 234 extends in a substantially back-and-forth direction, specifically, extends rearward and slightly upward. The connecting rod 236 extends in a substantially up-and-down direction.  Since the second link 234 moves forward and rearward with the first link 81 and the connection rod 236 as supporting points, the link mechanism 240 is such that the first link 81 and the connecting rod 23 6 constitute an almost-parallel link. That is to say, the first link 81 and the connecting rod 23 6 permit the power unit 56 to move forward and rearward. [0073]<br>
In addition, the second link 234 extends in a substantially back-and-forth direction and swings around the second pivot shaft 92 and the fourth pivot shaft 94<br><br>
is elastically supported by the side of the connecting rod 236. Therefore, the power unit 56 can be permitted to move upward and downward. [0074]<br>
Fig. 16 is a side view (the second embodiment) of the link mechanism according to the present invention. The connecting rod 23 6 of the link mechanism 24 0 includes a main plate member 243, an upper cylindrical member 244, a lower cylindrical member 24 6, an upper sub-plate member 247, an inner plate member 248, a lower sub-plate member 251, a rubber bushing 253, a rubber bushing 254, and stopper rubber 237.  The upper cylindrical member 244 is installed in the main plate member 243 so as to pass through the intermediate portion thereof. The lower cylindrical member 246 is installed in the main plate member 243 so as to pass through the lower portion thereof. The upper sub-plate member 247 is L-shaped in section and joined to the side surface of the main plate member 243 and to part of the outer circumferential surface of the upper cylindrical member 244 . The inner plate member 24 8 is dog-legged as viewed from the side and spanned between the side surface of the main plate member 24 3 and the inner surface of the upper sub-plate member 247. The lower sub-plate member 251 is of an<br><br>
angular U-shape in section, is joined to the side surface of the main plate member 243 and spanned between the respective outer circumferential surfaces of the upper cylindrical member 244 and lower cylindrical member 246. The rubber bushing 253 is fitted into the hollow portion of the upper cylindrical member 244 to connect the third pivot shaft 233 to the upper cylindrical member 244.  The rubber bushing 254 is fitted into the hollow portion of the lower cylindrical member 246 to connect the fourth pivot shaft 94 to the lower cylindrical member 24 6.  The stopper rubber 237 is attached to the upper portion of the inner plate member 248.  Incidentally, reference numeral 2 3 6A denotes an extension extending upward from the third pivot shaft 233 of the connecting rod 236. Reference numeral 237a denotes the front of the stopper rubber 237 and 237b denotes the back of the stopper rubber 237. [0075]<br>
The rubber bushing 2 53 includes an inner cylinder 256 fitted onto the third pivot shaft 233; an outer cylinder 2 57 provided outside the inner cylinder 2 56 and fitted into the upper cylinder member 244; and rubber 258 adhered to both the inner cylinder 256 and the outer cylinder 257.<br><br>
[0076]<br>
The rubber bushing 254 includes an inner cylinder 261 fitted onto the fourth pivot shaft 94; an outer cylinder 262 provided outside the inner cylinder 2 61 and fitted into the lower cylinder member 246; and rubber 263 adhered to both the inner cylinder 261 and the outer cylinder 262. The rubber 263 is formed with circular arc hole portions 263a, 263b line-symmetrical with respect to a straight line 2 65 in order to cause the rubber 263 to tend to be deformable along the straight line 265.<br>
[0077]<br>
The stopper rubber 237 is a member that has a front surface 23 7a abutting against the main frame 26 and a rear surface 237b abutting against the rear wall 231c of an inner pivot plate 231b.  In addition, it is an elastic body functioning as a stopper mechanism 266 which restricts as well as damps and vibration-proofs the swing of the connecting rod 23 6 during the forward and rearward see-saw-like swing of the connecting rod 23 6.<br>
[0078]<br>
In short, the stopper rubber 237, the rear wall 231c of the inner pivot plate 231b, and the main frame 26 mentioned above constitute the stopper mechanism 266. The rear wall 231c and the main frame 26 serve as a<br><br>
restrictive part provided on the vehicle body. [0079]<br>
A line segment joining the axle 233a (denoted with a black circle) of the third pivot shaft 233 with the axle 94a (denoted with a black circle) of the fourth pivot shaft 94 is denoted with reference numeral 267.  In addition, a straight line passing through the axle 94a is denoted with reference numeral 265 and a straight line passing through the axle 94a and running at a right angle to the straight line 2 65 is denoted with reference numeral 26 8. Thus, the line segment 267 and the straight<br>
line 265 form a predetermined angle a. [0080]<br>
The direction of the extending straight line 268, specifically, a direction of arrow A is a direction where the fourth pivot shaft 94 receives a reactive force during the acceleration of the vehicle. A direction of arrow B is a direction where the fourth pivot shaft. 94 receives a force when one occupant mounts on the vehicle (this state is called a 1-G mounting state).  The direction of the extending straight line 265 is a vibrating direction of the engine 59 (see Fig. 1). An endless curve 271 and the area within this endless curve 271 represent a movable range of the fourth pivot shaft<br><br>
94 .<br>
[0081]<br>
The rubber 263 of the rubber bushing 254 elastically supporting the fourth pivot shaft 94 is formed with hole portions 263a, 263b located along the straight line 265.  Therefore, the rubber 263 can support the fourth pivot shaft 94 with a great spring constant and hysteresis for the reactive force during the acceleration of the vehicle, and with a small spring constant for the vibration of the engine, resulting in effectively suppressed vibration.<br>
[0082]<br>
Fig. 17 is a cross-sectional view taken along line 17-17 of Fig. 15.  Link connecting parts 62a, 62b of the power unit 56 are connected to the fourth pivot shaft 94 via respective rubber bushings 2 81, 2 81.<br>
[0083]<br>
The rubber bushing 2 81 includes an inner cylinder<br>
284	formed with a hollow portion 284a adapted to insert the fourth pivot shaft 94 there through; an outer cylinder<br>
285	fitted into a through-hole 62c bored in the link connecting part 62a or into a through-hole 62d bored in the link connecting part 62b; and rubber 28 6 adhered to the inner cylinder 284 and the outer cylinder 285.<br><br>
[0084]<br>
In the figure, reference numerals 231e and 231f denote bolt insertion holes bored in the outer pivot plate 231a and the inner pivot plate 231b, respectively, to pass the third pivot shaft 233 therethrough.  Reference numeral 2 91 denotes a nut threadedly engaged with the external thread formed on the end of the third pivot shaft 23 3.

The front upper connection mechanism 314 connecting the first pivot shaft 28 with the first link 311, 311 is composed of a left upper connection mechanism 321, a right upper connection mechanism 322, and a cylindrical member 323 spanned between the left and right upper connection mechanisms 321, 322.  The left and right upper connection mechanisms 321 and 322 are symmetrical and have the same basic structure; therefore, only the left upper connection mechanism 321 is described. [0089]<br>
The left upper connection mechanism 321 includes an inner cylinder 325, a needle bearing 326, an outer cylinder 327 and an end plate 331. The inner cylinder 325<br><br>
is provided with a hollow portion 325a adapted to insert the first pivot shaft 28 thereinto.  The needle bearing 3 26 is fitted to the outer circumferential surface of the inner cylinder 325. The outer cylinder 327 is formed with an inner circumferential surface 3 2 7a to which the needle bearing 326 is fitted.

The first link 311 is welded to the outer circumferential surface of the outer cylinder 3 27. The outer cylinder 327 turns with respect to the inner cylinder 325 via the needle bearing 326, whereby the first link 311 swings with respect to the first pivot shaft 28.  Incidentally, reference numeral 333 denotes a dust seal provided between the inner cylinder 325 and the outer cylinder 327 in order to prevent entry of dust or the like into the needle bearing 326. [0090]<br>
The front lower connection mechanism 316 connecting the first link 311, 311 with the second pivot shaft 92 is composed of a left lower connection mechanism 341, a<br><br>
right lower connection mechanism 342, and a cylindrical member 34 3 spanned between the left and right lower connection mechanisms 341, 342. The left and right lower connection mechanisms 341 and 342 are symmetrical and have the same basic structure; therefore, only the left lower connection mechanism 341 is described. [0091]<br>
The left lower connection mechanism 341 includes an inner cylinder 345, a needle bearing 346, an outer cylinder 347 and an end plate 351.  The inner cylinder 345 is provided with a hollow portion 345a adapted to insert the second pivot shaft 92 thereinto. The needle bearing 346 is fitted to the outer circumferential surface of the inner cylinder 345. The outer cylinder 347 is formed with an inner circumferential surface 347a to which the needle bearing 346 is fitted.

The first link 311 is welded to the outer circumferential surface of the outer cylinder 347. The inner cylinder 345 and the second pivot<br><br>
shaft 92 turns with respect to the outer cylinder 347 via the needle bearing 346, whereby the second link 312 welded to the inner cylinder 345 swings with respect to the first link 311.  Incidentally, reference numeral 353 denotes a dust seal provided between the inner cylinder 345 and the outer cylinder 347 in order to prevent entry of dust or the like into the needle bearing 346. [0092]<br>
Fig. 20 is a perspective view (a fourth embodiment) of a link mechanism according to the present invention. In the figure, like reference numerals denote the same components as those of the first embodiment shown with reference to FIGS. 1 to 12 and its detailed explanation is omitted.<br>

[0093]<br>
In order to connect the third pivot shaft 93, the fourth pivot shaft 94, and the intermediate shaft 95, the<br><br>
connecting member 361 is formed with a through-hole 84b, a bushing attachment hole 3 61a and a through hole 84d at an upper end, a lower end, and an intermediate portion, respectively.  In addition, rubber bushings 111, 362, and<br>

In the figure, reference numerals 367a and 367b denote hole portions which are bored in the rubber 3 67 forward and rearward, respectively, of the inner cylinder 126 in order to cause the rubber 367 to easily transform<br><br>
up and down and which are symmetrical with respect to a<br>
line segment 131.<br>
[0096]<br>
Fig. 21 is a cross-sectional view (a fourth embodiment) taken along line 21-21 of Fig. 20. A front upper connection mechanism 3 71 connecting the first pivot shaft 28 with the first links 81 includes a left cylindrical portion 141, a right cylindrical portion 3 72, an inner cylinder 144, a left rubber bushing 3 73, a right rubber bushing 374, and an outer cylinder 148. The left cylindrical portion 141 is joined to a pivot plate 31 to pass therethrough and provided with a hollow portion 141a adapted to insert the first pivot shaft 28 thereinto.  The right cylindrical portion 372 is joined to a pivot plate 32 to pass therethrough and provided with a hollow portion 372a adapted to insert the first pivot shaft 28 thereinto. The inner cylinder 144 is provided with a hollow portion 144 adapted to insert the first pivot shaft 2 8 thereinto. The left rubber bushing 373 is adapted to insert the first pivot shaft 28 thereinto and disposed between the left cylindrical portion 141 and the inner cylinder 144. The right rubber bushing 374 is adapted to insert the first pivot shaft 28 thereinto and disposed between the right cylindrical portion 3 72 and<br><br>
the inner cylinder 144. The outer cylinder 148 is formed with inner circumferential surfaces 148b, 148c at both ends of the hollow portion 14 8a so as to be greater in inner diameter than the hollow portion 148a in order to fit the left and right rubber bushings 373, 374 thereinto. The first links 81, 81 are welded to the outer circumferences of both ends of the outer cylinder 148. The outer cylinder 14 8 turns with respect to the inner cylinder 144 via the left and right rubber bushings 373, 374, whereby the first links 81, 81 swing with respect to the first pivot shaft 28. [0097]<br>
The left rubber bushing 3 73 includes an inner cylinder 376, an outer cylinder 377 and rubber 378.  The inner cylinder 376 is provided with a hollow portion 376a adapted to insert the first pivot shaft 28 thereinto. The outer cylinder 3 77 is disposed to enclose the inner cylinder 3 76 and fitted into the inner circumferential surface 148b of the outer cylinder 148. The rubber 378 is adhered to the inner cylinder 376 and the outer cylinder 377. [0098]<br>
The right rubber bushing 3 74 includes an inner cylinder 381, an outer cylinder 382 and rubber 383.  The<br><br>
inner cylinder 381 is provided with a hollow portion 381a adapted to insert the first pivot shaft 28 thereinto.  The outer cylinder 3 82 is disposed to enclose the inner cylinder 3 81 and fitted into the inner circumferential surface 148c of the outer cylinder 148. The rubber 383 is adhered to the inner cylinder 3 81 and the outer cylinder 382.<br>
[0099]<br>
Fig. 22 is a cross-sectional view (the fourth embodiment) taken along line 22-22 of Fig. 20.  The second link 358 includes: a main arm 386 which is formed in an almost-U-shape and welded to the outer cylinder 164 in such a manner that its pair of opposite components are apart from each other as they go rearward; and a sub-arm 3 87 joined to the left side portion of the main arm 3 86. The main arm 3 86 and the sub-arm 387 hold the fourth pivot shaft 94.<br>
[0100]<br>
The connecting rod 361 is disposed between the main arm 3 86 and the sub-arm 3 87 and held by them via the fourth pivot shaft 94. Therefore, the support portion of the connecting rod 3 61 can be enhanced in rigidity.<br>
[0101]<br>
In the figure, reference numeral 3 91 denotes an<br><br>
outer bushing press fitted into each of through-holes 62e and 62f which are formed in the link connecting parts 62a and 62b, respectively, for a crankcase 62.  Reference numeral 3 92 denotes an inner bushing which is fitted onto the fourth pivot shaft 94 and also slidably into the outer bushing 3 91. [0102]<br>
Fig. 23 is a cross-sectional view (the fourth embodiment) taken along line 23-23 of Fig. 20.  In the figure, the link connecting parts 62a and 62b for the power unit 56 are coupled to the fourth pivot shaft 94 via metal bushings 393, 393 each composed of the outer bushing 391 and the inner bushing 392.  In addition, the connecting rod 3 61 is coupled to the fourth pivot shaft 94 via the rubber bushing 362. [0103]<br>
The lower end portion of the connecting rod 361 is configured such that it is formed with the bushing attachment hole 361a and an attachment hole 361b equal in inner diameter to the bushing attachment hole 361a, a stopper member 3 96 is fitted into the attachment hole 361b and a stopper 361c is formed integrally to the lower end to project inwardly between the bushing attachment hole 361a and the attachment hole 361b.<br><br>
[0104]<br>
The stopper member 3 96 includes a cylindrical member 397 fitted into the attachment hole 361b; and stopper rubber 3 98 adhered to the inside of the cylindrical member 3 97.  The stopper rubber 3 98 has an inner diameter greater than the outer diameter of the inner cylinder 3 64 of the rubber bushing 3 62. During the normal state where the rubber bushing 362 does not receive a large load applied otherwise thereto, there is a clearance between the stopper rubber 3 98 and the inner cylinder 364.  The rubber bushing 362, the stopper member 396 and the stopper 361c constitute a stopper mechanism. [0105]<br>
Figs. 24(a) and 24(b) are function diagrams illustrating the function of the bushing-stopper mechanism according to the present invention.<br>
Fig. 24(a) illustrates a state where no load is applied between the fourth pivot shaft 94 and the connecting rod 3 61. The rubber 3 66 of the rubber bushing 3 62 does not yield so that a clearance C1 exists between the stopper rubber 398 of the stopper member 396 and the inner cylinder 364 of the rubber bushing 362.  In addition, there is a clearance C2 between the inner circumferential surface 361d of the stopper 361c and the inner cylinder<br><br>
3 64. There is a relationship such that C2 &gt; C1. [0106]<br>
Fig. 24(b) illustrates a state where the fourth<br>
pivot shaft 94 is displaced by an amount of displacement 5 with respect to the connecting rod 361. When the fourth pivot shaft 94 is displaced with respect to the connecting rod 361, the rubber 366 of the rubber bushing 362 yields, so that the stopper rubber 398 of the stopper member 3 96 slightly yields to abut against the inner cylinder 362 (that is, C2 = zero).  In this state, since the inner cylinder 364 abuts against the stopper 3 61c, the further displacement is restricted. [0107]<br>
In this way, a combination of the stopper 3 96 with the rubber bushing 3 62 can largely vary elastic characteristics on the way of the displacement. Varying of the elastic characteristics can be made easily by changing the inner diameter of the stopper rubber 3 98, which increases the degree of freedom of designing the elastic characteristics.<br>
The stopper 361c can be formed easily by boring a hole, which can suppress costs.<br>
Incidentally, the stopper 361c may be formed independently of the connecting rod and held between the<br><br>
rubber bushing 362 and the stopper member 396. [0108]<br>
As described above with reference to Figs. 1, 6 and 7, firstly, the present invention is characterized by the following: The engine 59 and the rear wheel 14 as a driving wheel are integrally connected to the power unit 56, which is swingably suspended by the pivot plates 31, 32 as the body frame. The first links 81, 81 are swingably connected at its one ends to the associated pivot plates 31, 32.  The first links 81, 81 extend generally upward and downward so that the second link 82 is swingably connected at its one end to the other end of the first links 81, 81.  The second link 82 extends generally forward and backward so that the power unit 56 is swingably connected to the other end of the second link 82. The connecting rod 84 is swingably attached at its one end to the pivot plate 31, specifically, to the inner pivot plate 31b. The power unit 56 is swingably attached to the other end of the connecting rod 84.  The stopper mechanism 105 which restricts the forward and rearward movement of the power unit 56 is attached to the inner pivot plate 31b and connecting rod 84.  The line segment 133 extends upward and downward to connect the third pivot shaft 93 serving as a body side connection<br><br>
shaft installed in the connecting rod 84 with the fourth pivot shaft 94 serving as a power unit side connection shaft, which is supported by the connecting rod 84 via the rubber bushing 112 serving as an elastic member. [0109]<br>
With this configuration, while the stopper mechanism 105 restricts the forward and rearward movement of the power unit 56, the elastic force resulting from the deformation of the rubber bushing 112 of the fourth pivot shaft 94 installed at the connecting rod 84 can restrict the upward and downward movement of the power unit 56. Accordingly, while allowing the power unit 56 to be movable in two directions, i.e., the back-and-forth direction and up-and-down direction, the connecting rod can restrict the forward/rearward and upward/downward movements of the power unit 56. This makes it possible to simplify the stopper structure and reduce the number of part components, resulting in reduced costs. [0110]<br>
Secondly, the present invention is characterized in that the connecting rod 84 is provided with the intermediate shaft 95 serving as a second body side connection shaft between the third pivot shaft 93 and the fourth pivot shaft 94, the fourth pivot shaft 94 is<br><br>
connected to the power unit 56 via the rubber bushing 112 serving as an elastic member, and the intermediate shaft 95 is connected to the inner pivot plate 31b via the rubber bushing 113 serving as an elastic member.<br>
With this configuration, the rubber bushings 111 to 113 exhibit more improved damping performance than a single elastic member, which makes it possible to absorb greater vibrations, [0111]<br>
Thirdly, as shown in Figs. 5 and 6, the present invention is characterized in that the stopper mechanism 105 includes the projection 84a provided on the connecting rod 84; and the notch 31c formed in the inner pivot plate 31b in order to insert the projection 84a therein. [0112]<br>
With this configuration, for instance, if the projection 84a needs to be replaced due to its wear or the like, the replacement can be made more easily than when the projection is provided on the power unit in the traditional way. Additionally, the stopper mechanism 105 can be installed with a simple structure. [0113]<br>
Fourthly, as shown in Fig. 16, the present<br><br>
invention is characterized in that the stopper mechanism 2 66 includes the stopper rubber 237 as an elastic body; the main frame 26 as a restrictive portion; and the rear wall 231c of the inner pivot plate 231b.  Specifically, the stopper rubber 237 is secured to the end of the extension 236A which extends from the third pivot shaft 233, as a body side connecting shaft, of the connecting rod 236, in a direction different from that of the fourth pivot shaft 92 as a power unit side connecting shaft.  The main frame 2 6 is provided on the vehicle body in order to abut against the stopper rubber 237. [0114]<br>
For instance, varying the shape or hardness of the stopper rubber 237 can adjust the forward and rearward swing of the power unit 56 while the stopper rubber 237 exhibits damping and vibration-proofing effects.  Further, when intending to ensure the large swing, it is easy to cope with the intention. [0115]<br>
Fifthly, as shown in Figs. 1, 6 and 7, the present invention is characterized in that the main stand 61 is provided below the power unit 56.<br>
With this configuration, while the main stand 61 is raised, the improvement of the damping performance<br><br>
resulting from the three rubber bushings 111 to 113 of the connecting rod 84 can makes it easy to absorb the vibrations of the power unit 56, thereby reducing vibrations propagating through the body frame 11.<br>
[0116]<br>
Sixthly, the present invention is characterized in that the elastic member is composed of a rubber bushing and the rubber bushing 112 of the fourth pivot shaft 94 is provided with the hole portions 123a and 123b located above and below, respectively, the fourth pivot shaft 94 so as to provide a characteristic softer in an upward and downward direction than in the forward and rearward direction of the vehicle.<br>
[0117]<br>
With this configuration, the rubber bushing 112 of the fourth pivot shaft 94 positively absorbs vibrations resulting from the upward and downward movement of the power unit 56 through a simple structure, which makes the upward and downward vibrations of the power unit 56 resistive to propagate to the body frame 11.<br>
[0118]<br>
Seventhly, the present invention is characterized in that the elastic member is composed of a rubber bushing and the rubber bushing 113 of the intermediate<br><br>
shaft 95 is provided with the hole portions 128a and 128b located forward of and rearward of, respectively, the intermediate shaft 95 so as to exhibit a characteristic softer in the forward-and-rearward direction of the vehicle body than in the upward-and-downward direction. [0119]<br>
With this configuration, the rubber bushing 113 of the intermediate shaft 95 positively absorbs vibrations resulting from the forward and rearward movement of the power unit 56 through a simple structure, which can make the forward and rearward vibrations of the power unit 56 resistive to propagate to the body frame 11. [0120]<br>
Eighthly, the present invention is characterized in that the line segment 131 that connects the third pivot shaft 93 with the intermediate shaft 95 and the line segment 132 that connects the fourth pivot shaft 94 with the pivot shaft 94 form a dogleg.<br>
With this configuration, since the fourth pivot shaft 94 can be disposed apart from the body frame 11, the fourth pivot shaft 94 can be set at a large swing while preventing the connecting rod 84 and the body frame 11 from interfering with each other. [0121]<br><br>
Ninthly, the present invention is characterized in that, as shown in Fig. 3, the connecting rod 84 is single and is provided only on one side of the body frame 11.<br>
With this configuration, the link mechanism 105 can<br>
* be simplified to reduce the number of part components,<br>
resulting in reduced costs.<br>
[0122]<br>
Tenthly, the present invention is characterized in that the connecting rod 84 is made by forging.<br>
This makes it possible to form the projection 84a of the stopper mechanism 105 with a high degree of strength and to make the connecting rod 84 lightweight. [0123]<br>
Eleventhly, the present invention is characterized in that, as shown in Fig. 9, the fourth pivot shaft 94 is supported by the left arm 175, the right arm 176 and the end arm 178 serving as a plurality of connection supporting portions included in the second link 92, and the connecting rod 84 is joined to the fourth pivot shaft 94 so as to be placed between, of the connection supporting portions 175, 176, 178, the left arm 175 serving as a first connection supporting portion and the end arm 178 serving as a second connection supporting portion located outward of the left arm 175 with respect<br><br>
to the vehicle body. [0124]<br>
With this configuration, since the connecting rod 84 is supported so as to be placed between the left arm 175 and the end arm 178, a portion supporting the connecting rod 84 can be increased in rigidity, whereby the effect of the connecting rod 84 can be exhibited more surely. [0125]<br>
Twelvethly, as shown in Figs. 23 and 24, the present invention is characterized in that a plurality of the elastic members interposed between the fourth pivot shaft 94 and the connecting rod 361 are composed of the rubber 366 and the stopper rubber 398, which are disposed in the axial direction.  In addition, the stopper 3 61c is provided as a restricting means between the rubber 366 and the stopper rubber 398 in order to set the flexible volume of the rubber 3 66 and stopper rubber to a value not greater than a predetermined value. [0126]<br>
With this configuration, the flexible volume of the rubber 366 and stopper rubber 398 can be set with a simple structure and also varied by modifying the shape of the stopper 3 61c; therefore, the degree of freedom of<br><br>
design can be increased.<br>
[0127]<br>
Incidentally, as shown in Fig. 3, the connecting rod 84 is provided on the left-hand side of the body-frame 11 in the present embodiment; however, the present invention is not limited to this arrangement.  That is, the connecting rod 84 may be provided on the right-hand side of the body frame 11.  Further, if the spring rates of the rubber 123, 128 of the rubber bushings 112, 113 are each set to an optimum rate, it is possible to omit the hole portions 123a, 123b, 128a, 128b.  In addition, the hole portions can be eliminated depending on the nature of a vehicle.<br>
[0128]<br>
As shown in Fig. 19, while the outer cylinders 327, 345 are each divided into the left-hand part and the right-hand part, one of the outer cylinders 327 and 345 may be divided into the left-hand and right-hand portions. Further, for the first and second embodiments shown in Figs. 8 and 14, respectively, at least one of the outer cylinders 148 and 164 may be divided into left-hand and right-hand parts and then connected via a connection member.<br>
