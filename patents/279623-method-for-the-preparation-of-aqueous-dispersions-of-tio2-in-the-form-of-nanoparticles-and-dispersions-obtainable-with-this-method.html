Method for the preparation of aqueous dispersions of Ti02 in the form of nanoparticies, and dispersions obtainable with this method<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of methods for the preparation of<br>
compounds in the form of nanometric particles, and in particular, to a method<br>
relating to a way for preparing TJO2 dispersions in the form of nanoparticies.<br>
PRIOR ART.<br>
Titanium dioxide Is a white pigment with a very strong covering capacity used in<br>
particular in paints, and in the production of paper and synthetic rubber. Among<br>
the most recent applications of Titanium dioxide is the attempt to  use its<br>
photocatalytic activities to best advantage. In other words, through the action c2<br>
ultraviolet light, to use this capacity to generate radical species able to catalysi<br>
the oxidising degradation of harmful or toxic substances, such as benzene, dioxir<br>
and   other  organic   pollutants,   but  also   unpleasant  and   sickness-provokin<br>
substances such as mould and bacteria. These applications are therefore used i<br>
wide environmental fields ranging from combating pollutants to detergents an<br>
sterilising products.<br>
For these applications, Titanium dioxide is used as a coating on the-surfaces to b<br>
treated In order to maximise the photocatatyctic effect. The crystalline form c<br>
Titanium dioxide called "anatase" is the most popular for this type of applicatio<br>
because, as well as being chemically stable and easily available, it also possesse<br>
a photocatalytic activity that is higher than the other two crystalline forms,   rutil<br>
and brookite.<br>
On the other hand, the superposition of the Titanium dioxide absorption spectrun<br>
—Qitf-n in anatacTP fnrm, nn thp g;nlajL_qpRntnim   1.=; not very large   and this resiilt.q<br>
low photocatalytic efficiency levels. For this reason various attempts have bee made to modify TiO2, for example, by doping it with other metals, or by preparir the compound In question in the form of nanoparticies; in fact this increases tf surface area enormously and thus, also the photocatalytic efficiency. Several methods exist for preparing TiO2 anatase, including in nanopartlcle fort that provide TiO2 in powder form. In order to be suitable for the preparation<br>
 <br>
Dhotocatalvtic coatings, this powder must be dispersed in an appropriate solvent<br>
and formulated with other possible additives to improve coating adhesion, but this<br>
causes the coagulation of the Titanium dioxide particles making it impossible to<br>
maintain  the photocatalytic efficiency and activity of the particulate material.<br>
Moreover, over a period of time, the TiO2 particles in these dispersions tend to<br>
settle in the bottom of the containers where they are stored creating stability<br>
problems during storage.<br>
Furthermore,  the  patent application  n° FI2004A252  (by  the  same  Applicant)<br>
describes a method that allows the preparation of stable nanopartiole dispersions<br>
of Titanium dioxide in anatase form where<br>
water and suitable complexing solvents are used as the solvents<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION,<br>
Recently the Applicant created a method for obtaining nanoparticles of Titanium<br>
dioxide in anatase form already dispersed in water only, and directly usable for the<br>
preparation of photocatalytic coatings. The dispersions obtained with the method<br>
according  to   the   invention  did   not  provoke   particle  coagulation   even   after<br>
prolonged storage, thus allowing the preparation of coatings which maintain the<br>
photocatalytic   activity   of   the   particulate   material      thanks   to   dispersion<br>
homogeneity.<br>
Therefore the aim of the present invention is a method for the preparation of<br>
nanoparticie dispersions of Titanium dioxide in anatase form in water, wherein a<br>
Titanium alkoxide is made to react under heat in water in the presence of mineral<br>
acid and a non-ionic surfactant and where necessary,  the solution  is finally<br>
reduced to a small volume.    A further aim of the invention is the use of the<br>
nanopartiole dispersions of Titanium dioxide in anatase form in water, obtained<br>
using this method, as well as their use for the preparation of photocatalytic surface<br>
coatings, for the photocatalytic decontamination of gases and liquids, and for the<br>
preparation of formula for cosmetics that provide a protective action against sun<br>
rays for the human skin ,<br>
The characteristics and advantages of the invention will be illustrated in detail in<br>
the following descnption.<br>
 <br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE APPENDED FIGURE<br>
Figure 1  shows a difractogram of the dried product powder, where the y-axis<br>
shows the radiation intensity while the x-axis shows the amplitude of the radiation<br>
incidence angle. This analysis demonstrates how crystalline titanium dioxide in<br>
anatase form is obtained using this method.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION.<br>
The method of the present invention is able to produce TiO2 in anatase form.directly<br>
in water, and to obtain a dispersion of TiO2 particles at the end of the process with a<br>
size between 30-50 nm.    Particle measurement was performed using various<br>
methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as XRD {X-Ray Diffraction),<br>
FEG-SEM   (Field   Emission   Gun   -   Scanning   Electron   Microscopy),    TEM<br>
(Transmission Electron Microscopy) and DLS (Dynamic Light Scattering). Unlike<br>
those prepared dispersing nanometric powders in the solvent mixtures or in water,<br>
these dispersions show no signs of conglomeration  or coagulation and solid<br>
precipitation, even after prolonged periods of the dispersion product storage.<br>
The advantages to be gained with dispersions of this type are obvious and<br>
associated with the photo catalytic efficiency and uniformity of the coatings that<br>
can be prepared with said dispersions. The dispersion index obtainable with the<br>
method according to the present invention, measured with DLS (Dynamic Light<br>
Scattering) techniques, is lower than 0.3, and thus the dispersion according to the<br>
invention  differs from those obtained using  prior methods composed of the<br>
preparation of nanoparticle powder, subsequently dispersed in solvent.<br>
The titanium aikoxide used as the starting product in this method can be chosen<br>
from the group composed of titanium methoxids, ethoxide, normal-propoxide, iso-<br>
propoxide, normal-butoxide, and isobutoxide.<br>
Particularly preferable is Titanium isopropoxlde since it is cheaper and reacts<br>
better under the conditions used in the present method.<br>
The non-ionic surfactants are surface-active agents composed of an apolar part<br>
and a polar function, non-ionisable ether, ester, ether-ester; particularly preferable<br>
JsTritonX-lOO(TX-IOO)<br>
The term mineral acid according to the invention   refers, for example, to an acid<br>
 <br>
perchloric acid, hydrobromic acid and hydrogen iodide; preferably halogen acids are<br>
used, and in particular hydrochloric acid.<br>
The alcoholate molar ratio of titanium alkoxide /mineral acid is between 0.005 and 15,<br>
and preferably between 5 and 5.<br>
The reaction temperature ranges between  15°C and 95°C, preferably between 45°C<br>
and 55°C.<br>
Reaction times range between 12 h and 72 h, and preferably 24 h.<br>
Where necessary, when used for coating preparations, the present dispersions<br>
can possibly be formulated using additives and diluents commonly employed in<br>
the field of surface coatings, such as adhesion improved agents or solvents such<br>
as water or ethanol for example, in order to obtain the required dilution level.<br>
On the other hand, when used to decontaminate liquid or gaseous products, the<br>
present dispersions are adsorbed respectively on a silica gel support, or on some<br>
other suitable inorganic support with adsorbent characteristics, that is then immersed<br>
in the liquid, or placed in its current state or diluted, in containers in which the gas to<br>
be purified is bubbled through for washing.<br>
The supports on which surface coatings prepared with the present dispersion can<br>
be applied are widely varied, from woven fibre products in rolls or already made up<br>
into garments, to ceramic products, as well as supports in glass, metal, mirror, and<br>
similar materials.<br>
The  photocatalytic  activity  of  the   surface   coating   according   to  the  present<br>
invention is explained as a result of the exposure of the coating in question to light<br>
with a suitable wave length, typically less than 388 nm, which produces a surface<br>
with   bacteria-proof,   bacteriostatic   and   super-hydrophilic  properties   after  its<br>
exposure to UV light.  In fact, supports coated with Ti02 show a total lack of water<br>
repellent capacity,  so-called  super-hydrophilic  capacity,  that  makes  surfaces<br>
treated with Ti02 self-cleaning.<br>
Moreover, given the extremely small size of the Ti02 particles, the present<br>
dispersions are practically transparent, leaving the appearance of the surface on<br>
which they are applied, totally unchanged. This transparency also makes the<br>
product suitable for use in cosmetic fields for the preparation of sun filters with<br>
high UV ray protection levels.<br>
 <br>
A  further  advantage  of  the  present dispersions,   is  their  behaviour at   high<br>
temperatures. In fact, the application of the surface coating on ceramic supports<br>
requires high temperature processing of the support on which the dispersion is<br>
applied and the present dispersions maintain exactly the same appearance,<br>
crystalline form of anatase and nanopartlcle nature of the coating as before the<br>
heating process.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the present method, the Ti can be doped<br>
with a metal selected from the transition metal series^ and in particular Ag, Cu and<br>
Ce by means of the addition of a salt of one of these metals to the starting<br>
solution. In this way, the method will lead to the forming of a dispersion of Ti02<br>
doped with Ag, Cu or Ce, which are able to perform their catalytic activities even<br>
without UV light rays.<br>
Below are certain examples of the invention   provided as illustrations but to be<br>
considered by no means limiting.<br>
