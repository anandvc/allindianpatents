				<td>A TOOTHBRUSH HEAD BEING CONNECTED OR CONNECTABLE AT ITS BASE END TO<br>
TOOTHBRUSH GRIP HANDLE TO THEREBY DEFINE A HEAD HANDLE LONGITUDINAL<br>
DIRECTION<br>
Toothbrush<br>
This invention relates to toothbrush heads, in particular to toothbrush heads<br>
comprising plural sections which can bend under the pressures of toothbrushing. The<br>
invention also relates to a toothbrush provided with such a head.<br>
Toothbrushes generally comprise a grip handle by which a user may hold the<br>
toothbrush and a bristle-carrying head, the head and handle being disposed along a<br>
longitudinal head-handle direction. Sometimes the head is replaceably connectable to<br>
the handle. Normally there is a neck between the head and the grip handle, being<br>
narrower than the adjacent part of the head and handle. The head has a tip end remote<br>
from the handle and a base end closest to the handle and the neck is joined to the head<br>
at the base end of the head. The junction between the base end of the head and the<br>
neck is generally marked by an inflexion point, i.e. a point of sharpest curvature<br>
between the head and the neck as seen in plan looking down along the bristles carried<br>
by the head, or alternatively by for example the edge of the pattern of bristle tufts<br>
closest to the handle.<br>
In toothbrushes, as is well known, the head and grip handle are disposed so<br>
define a longitudinal direction (which need not be a straight line) between them, with<br>
a width direction perpendicular to this longitudinal direction. Bristles (the term<br>
encompasses other dental cleaning elements such as elastomer lamellae or fingers)<br>
extend from the head in a bristle direction generally perpendicular to the longitudinal<br>
and width directions. The head has a tip end furthest from the handle, and a<br>
longitudinally distanced base end closest to the handle and defined by he end of the<br>
bristle cluster and/or by an inflexion point in the shape of the head.<br>
It is known to provide the head in the form of plural, particularly two or three,<br>
longitudinally elongate sections disposed widthways adjacent across the toothbrush<br>
head and being flexibly linked to the handle. A problem associated with known<br>
toothbrushes of this type is optimising the bristle distribution to improve cleaning.<br>
For example US-A-1,323,0152 discloses a toothbrush head comprising three<br>
flexible sections, the middle section being widened to form a pad adjacent the tip of<br>
the head and which extends across the entire width of the toothbrush head adjacent to<br>
the tip end, but having a relatively narrow " stalk" linking this pad to the handle. US-<br>
D440,404 and US-D 1536,446 disclose toothbrushes with their heads comprising three<br><br><br>
sections, each linked to the grip handle by its own respective flexible neck, but each<br>
section being narrow relative to length. US-A-4, 864,676 discloses a head in the form<br>
of three sections comprising a middle section laterally flanked by two outer sections,<br>
the ends of the outer sections remote from the handle forming a partial ring around the<br>
end of the middle section, the middle section having bristles only in a small tuft at its<br>
end. US-A-4,4152,853 discloses a toothbrush comprising three widthways adjacent<br>
flexible necks each having a bristle carrying pad at its extremity remote from the<br>
handle, but this results in a head which is disproportionately wide relative to its<br>
length.<br>
WO-A0l/89344, FR-A-2548528 and US-A-5,499,1521 disclose heads<br>
comprising two such sections.<br>
The purpose of such toothbrush heads comprising side by side sections<br>
flexibly linked to the handle so as to bend in response to toothbrushing pressures is to<br>
improve the ability of the head to adjust to the profile of the teeth, to improve the<br>
effectiveness of the head in reaching gaps between the teeth, particularly to achieve<br>
this improvement without application of excessive brushing pressures to the teeth, to<br>
distribute brushing pressures between the teeth and gums, and to allow a flow of water<br>
through the head so that the head may be thoroughly cleaned of for example excess<br>
toothpaste, debris etc. after use.<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide an improved toothbrush of the<br>
above-mentioned type, particularly aiming at providing an improved distribution of<br>
bristles on the head. Other objects and advantages of this invention will be apparent<br>
from the following description.<br>
According to this invention a toothbrush head is provided, being connected or<br>
connectable at its base end to a toothbrush grip handle to thereby define a head-handle<br>
longitudinal direction, and comprising three widthways adjacent, longitudinally<br>
extending sections from which bristles extend, being a middle section and a lateral<br>
section on each widthways side of the middle section, one or more section being<br>
resiliently flexibly connected or connectable to the grip handle, characterised in that:-<br>
the end of the middle section adjacent to the tip end of the head is integrally<br>
widthways enlarged relative to the part of the middle section longitudinally adjacent<br>
nearer to the handle to provide a bristle-carrying pad adjacent to the tip end of the<br><br><br>
head and which extends across the entire width of the toothbrush head adjacent to the<br>
tip end,<br>
the middle section comprises an intermediate bristle-carrying pad, being a<br>
region of maximum width of the part of the middle section between the tip pad and<br>
the base end of the head,<br>
with a first link region of the section between the tip pad and the intermediate<br>
pad being narrower in width than the adjacent part of the tip pad and the intermediate<br>
pad,<br>
and a second link region of the section between the intermediate pad and the<br>
handle being narrower in width than the adjacent part of the intermediate pad.<br>
Preferably the head comprises only three such sections, i.e. a middle section<br>
and two lateral sections. Preferably two or more, preferably all of the sections, are<br>
resiliently flexibly connected to the grip handle so that the section may be resiliency<br>
bent out of a plane parallel to the longitudinal and width directions under the action of<br>
pressure on the bristles.<br>
Preferably there is only one intermediate pad, only one first link region and<br>
only one second link region.<br>
Typically the tip pad may be approximately of equal dimensions in the<br>
widthways and longitudinal directions, e.g. being approximately circular, semi-<br>
circular, rectangular or polygonal. Typically in its longitudinal, direction such a tip pad<br>
may have a length of ca. 10-50%, e.g. 20-30% of the toothbrush head between its base<br>
and tip ends.<br>
Typically such a tip pad may be of a size suitable to carry a polygonal cluster<br>
of bristles, typically disposed in plural tufts containing plural bristles and extending in<br>
a bristle direction generally perpendicular to the longitudinal and width directions.<br>
Typically the tip pad is large enough to carry 4-10 tufts of bristles of the typical size<br>
of toothbrush bristle tufts e.g. tufts of 1 - 2 mm diameter or greatest sectional<br>
dimension . A suitable arrangement of tufts is a polygon of 5-3 tufts surrounding one<br>
or more central tuft.<br>
	The bristle carrying surface of the middle section may be substantially planar,<br>
or undulating, or may be curved e.g. concavely on the side on which the bristles are<br>
carried. Preferably the bristle-carrying surface of the tip pad may form an angle of<br><br><br>
180° or less, e.g. 180°-160° with the surface, which may also be bristle carrying, of the<br>
adjacent part of the section closer to the handle, for example with the surface of the<br>
first link region. Similarly the bristle carrying surface of the lateral sections may be<br>
substantially planar, or undulating or may be curved e.g. concavely on the surface on<br>
which the bristles are carried.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the tip pad extends longitudinally beyond the ends<br>
of the lateral sections remotest from the handle, typically for a distance of ca. 15-30%,<br>
e.g. 18-25% e.g. 20+/- 2% of the length of the toothbrush head between its base end<br>
-i<br>
and tip end. In this way the tip pad extends across the entire width of the toothbrush<br>
head adjacent to the tip end, i.e. for at least part of its longitudinal extension the tip<br>
pad is not flanked on either of its sides by a lateral section.<br>
Preferably the ratio of the widths of the tip pad and intermediate pad are in the<br>
range 1: 1.5 to 1.5 :1, e.g. in the range 1 :1.2 to 1.2 :1. Preferably the tip pad is<br>
wider than the intermediate pad.<br>
The intermediate pad may for example have a length 20-40%, e.g. ca 30 +/-<br>
5% of the length of the toothbrush head between the tip end and the base end of the<br>
head. The intermediate pad is preferably located so that 50% or more, particularly<br>
preferably 75% or more, even more so 90% or more, preferably all of its bristle face is<br>
in the longitudinal half of the head furthest from the tip end of the head. For example<br>
the widest part of the intermediate pad may be closer to the base end of the head than<br>
to the tip end of the head, for example 20-40% of the distance from the base end of the<br>
head toward the tip end of the head.<br>
The tip pad and intermediate pads may have bristle-bearing surfaces of<br>
substantially the same area, and/or may have thereon clusters of bristle tufts fitting<br>
within an envelope of substantially the same area. For example the bristle-bearing<br>
surfaces of the tip pad and intermediate pad may differ by no more than 20% in area.<br>
The intermediate pad may for example be circular, oval or polygonal in plan as<br>
viewed down the bristle direction. Typically the intermediate pad is large enough to<br>
carry 4-12 tufts of bristles of the typical size of toothbrush bristle tufts e.g. tufts of 1 -<br>
 2 mm diameter or greatest dimension cut across the bristle direction. A suitable<br>
arrangement of tufts is a polygon of 5-10 tufts surrounding one or more central tuft,<br>
for example including 2-4 tufts of bristles in line across the intermediate pad. The first<br><br><br>
and second link regions may for example narrow such that they cany only one tuft of<br>
bristles across their width.<br>
The middle section may consequently comprise longitudinally sequentially a<br>
widthways narrow region extending from the base end of the head toward the tip end<br>
of the head from the direction of the handle to comprise the second link region and<br>
enlarging widthways at a place intermediate between the base of the head and the tip<br>
pad to form the intermediate pad, a widthways narrow region extending from the<br>
intermediate pad toward the tip end of the head from the direction of the handle to<br>
comprise the first link region, and integrally enlarging widthways adjacent to the tip<br>
end of the head to form such a tip pad,.<br>
The junction between the tip pad or the intermediate pad and the adjacent first<br>
or second link region is preferably marked by an inflexion point, i.e. a point of<br>
sharpest curvature between the pad and link region as seen in plan looking down<br>
along the bristles carried by the head.<br>
The length of the first link region between the tip pad and the intermediate pad<br>
may for example be longer than the length of the respective tip pad or intermediate<br>
pad, for example being in the range 1-1.5 of the length of the tip pad or intermediate<br>
pad.<br>
The second link region is preferably between the intermediate pad and the base<br>
end of the head.<br>
One or more section may be resiliency flexibly connected to the grip handle in<br>
various ways.<br>
For example all the sections may be made of a resilient material integral with<br>
the grip handle of the toothbrush. For example two or more of the sections may be<br>
connected, e.g. integrally, to each other and/or to the toothbrush handle, at a part of<br>
the toothbrush remote from the tip end of the head.<br>
Preferably at least one, preferably all, section(s) are connected to the grip<br>
handle by an integral resiliency flexible neck. Such a neck may be flexible, and/or the<br>
link between the neck and the section, or between the neck and the handle may be<br>
 flexible. The resiliently, i.e. springy, flexible neck may be achieved by integral,<br>
construction with the types of plastics materials commonly used for toothbrushes.<br><br>
For example one or more, e.g. all of the sections may be respectively<br>
connected to the grip handle by means of a respective flexible neck. Such a neck may<br>
extend between the base end of the of the section, i.e. the end of the section remote<br>
from the tip end, and an end of the grip handle which is closest to the section.<br>
Typically in such a construction each section of the head may be connected to the grip<br>
handle by a respective neck being an integral extension of the section toward the<br>
handle. Such a neck may be approximately as long as the section, e.g. having a length<br>
in the range 0.4 - 1.5, preferably 0.5 - 0.75 of the length of the head section. Such<br>
dimensions are found to provide suitable resilience.<br>
Such necks may have longitudinally parallel widhrways adjacent sides.<br>
Alternatively and preferably the widthways adjacent sides may taper in their<br>
widthways spacing so as to be spaced apart with an air gap between them at their ends<br>
closest to the handle, but such that they, and/or the sections they are connected to are<br>
in contact at their ends closest to the tip. The angle of taper may be 0.5-5°.<br>
There may be a flexible material, e.g. an elastomeric material, e.g. a thin<br>
flexible web of such a material, between widthways adjacent parts of such necks, e.g.<br>
adjacent to the ends of such necks closest to the grip handle.<br>
Alternatively one or more, e.g. every sections may be flexibly connected, e.g.<br>
at the base end of the head, to a neck which extends to the grip handle.<br>
One or more, e.g. all of the sections, may be flexible, for example<br>
incorporating resiliency flexible links between longitudinally or widthways adjacent<br>
regions of the section, for example between the tip pad and the first link region.<br>
The widthways adjacent longitudinally extending sides of the sections may be<br>
straight linear or alternatively they may be of a complementary interlocking shape,<br>
e.g. a complementary sinuous or undulating shape.<br>
Each section may carry bristles, which may for example be disposed in one or<br>
more longitudinally extending row of tufts of bristles. Bristles may extend in a<br>
direction at a perpendicular or non-perpendicular angle to the longitudinal and width<br>
directions.<br>
One or more section may be resiliency flexible in a widthways outward and<br>
inward direction. To avoid excessive outward splay of a lateral section the middle<br>
and adjacent lateral section may be provided with abutment parts so that if a lateral<br><br><br>
section bends outwardly an abutment part of the lateral section abuts against an<br>
abutment part of the middle section to limit the extent to which the lateral section can<br>
move outwardly. For example an enlarged pad comprising the end of the middle<br>
section may have a concavity with an opening facing toward the grip handle and into<br>
which an abutment part of a lateral section may fit such that a surface of the concavity<br>
comprises a corresponding abutment part.<br>
Between widthways adjacent sections there may be an air gap allowing<br>
relative movement of the adjacent sections. Alternatively widthways adjacent<br>
sections may be in contact, allowing sliding relative movement of the sections, for<br>
example in a relative direction perpendicular to both the longitudinal and widthways<br>
directions. There may be a flexible material, e.g. an elastomeric material, e.g. a thin<br>
flexible filling or web of such a material, between widthways adjacent sections.<br>
Preferably at least one section, more preferably all sections, are adapted to<br>
carry bristles. For example the section(s) may be provided with bristle holes into<br>
which bristle tufts may subsequently be fixed. Alternatively bristle tufts may be<br>
embedded into the section(s) by a known process in which the ends of the tufts project<br>
into a mould cavity in which the section is made by injection moulding.<br>
In a preferred form of the toothbrush of the invention:<br>
all sections carry bristles and are integrally flexibly connected by a neck to the<br>
 toothbrush handle,<br>
the bristle carrying tip pad adjacent to the tip end of the head has a length of<br>
ca. 20-30% of the toothbrush head between its base and tip ends,<br>
the tip pad extends longitudinally beyond the ends of the lateral sections<br>
remotest from the handle, and extends across the entire width of the toothbrush head<br>
 adjacent to the tip end,<br>
the middle section comprises a single intermediate bristle carrying pad being a<br>
region of maximum width of the part of the section between the tip pad and the base<br>
end of the head, from which tufts of bristles extend, and which is located entirely in<br>
the longitudinal half of the toothbrush head closest to the handle, and has a length of<br>
 ca. 20-40% of the toothbrush head between its base and tip ends,<br>
a first link region of the section between the tip pad and the intermediate pad is<br>
narrower in width than the adjacent part of the tip pad and the intermediate pad,<br><br><br>
a second link region of the section between the intermediate pad and the neck<br>
is narrower in width than the adjacent part of the intermediate pad,<br>
the bristle carrying surface of the tip pad forming an angle of 180° or less with<br>
the surface of the first link region.<br>
As seen in plan looking along the bristle direction the middle section<br>
comprising the tip pad, first link region and intermediate pad consequently has a so<br>
called "dumb bell" shape.<br>
The preferred construction provides that on the middle section the bristle tufts<br>
are concentrated on the tip pad and intermediate pad, e.g. with 60% or more, e.g. 60 -<br>
80% of the bristle tufts located on the tip and intermediate pads, and the residue of<br>
tufts making up to 100% on the link regions.<br>
In this preferred construction the two pads, i.e. the tip and intermediate pad are<br>
longitudinally separated by a distance corresponding approximately to the surfaces of<br>
the teeth, and therefore provide improved cleaning efficacy. Such a distance may for<br>
example be 1 - 2cm between the centres of the tip and intermediate pads.<br>
The toothbrush head of this invention may be integrally made of a resiliently<br>
flexible plastic material such as polypropylene, polystyrene etc., as well known for<br>
toothbrush manufacture. The plastics material may be selected to optimise resilience<br>
of the section and/or neck and for example a relatively stiff plastic, e.g. a fibre-<br>
reinforced plastics material, e.g. polyester fibre-reinforced polypropylene, may be<br>
used. The section(s) and neck(s) may be integrally made of such plastic material with<br>
the grip handle.<br>
The grip handle may be made of a plastic material such as the above, or may<br>
also comprise grip-enhancing parts of an elastomeric material, of a generally known<br>

Referring to Fig. 1 a toothbrush 10 is shown overall (Fig. 1 A), with a head 11<br>
which is shown overall in a perspective plan view (Fig. 1B) perspective underside<br>
view (Fig. 1C), side (Fig. 1D) and plan (Fig. 1E) views. The toothbrush head 11<br><br><br>
extends integrally toward a grip handle 12, the head 11 and grip handle 12 being<br>
disposed along a longitudinal direction L-L, having a width direction W-W<br>
perpendicular to the longitudinal direction and having a thickness dimension T-T.<br>
The head 11 has a base end 13 A, being the end of the bristle pattern, nearest to grip<br>
handle 12 and a tip end 13B. Longitudinally between the base: end 13A of head 11 and<br>
handle 12 is an integral neck region 14.<br>
The head 11 is divided into three widthways adjacent sections 15, 16, 17 being<br>
a middle section 15 flanked on each widthways side by two lateral sections 16, 17.<br>
Each section 15, 16, 17 is elongated parallel to the longitudinal direction L-L. From a<br>
surface of each section 15, 16, 17 of head 11 extend bristles 20 in a bristle direction B<br>
perpendicular to the width direction W-W.<br>
The middle section 15 is widthways enlarged at its end furthest from the<br>
handle 12 i.e. forming a tip pad 18. The surface 19 of tip pad 18 is of a size suitable to<br>
cany a polygonal cluster of tufts of bristles 20. The middle section 15 is enlarged at<br>
152 into a widened part between the pad 18 and the base end, i.e. forming an<br>
intermediate pad. The widthways adjacent surfaces of the lateral sections 16., 17 are<br>
correspondingly shaped. On the pad 152 tufts of bristles 20 are arranged widthways<br>
adjacent. Fig. 1D shows that the surfaces of the sections 15, 16, 17 from which the<br>
bristles 20 extend are gently concave curved in their longitudinal direction.<br>
Between the tip pad 18 and intermediate pad 152 is a first link region 151, and<br>
between the intermediate pad 152 and the base end of the head 13 is a second link<br>
region 153. The surface 19 of the pad 18 forms an angle of 180° with the surface of<br>
the adjacent part of link region 151.<br>
The junction between the base end 13 of the head and the neck 14 as seen in<br>
the plan views Figs 1B and Fig. 1E is distinguished by an inflexion point of greatest<br>
curvature.<br>
The bristles 20 are disposed in discrete tufts. As shown in Fig. 1 the tufts are<br>
arranged in rows extending generally widthways across the head, and rows extending<br>
generally longitudinally along each section 15, 16 17.<br>
At the base end 13 of the head 11 each of the three sections 15, 16, 17 is<br>
integrally formed into a respective neck 21, 22, 23 by which the section is connected<br>
to the grip handle 12. Each neck 21,22,23 is made of resiliently flexible plastic<br><br><br>
material so that the neck 21,22,23 flexibly and resiliency links its section 15, 16,17<br>
to the grip handle 12. The length of each neck 21,22,23 is approximately the same<br>
as the length of the section 15, 16, 17, but may be varied to suit requirements.<br>
The grip handle 12 is of generally conventional construction and design, and<br>
incorporates an elastomeric grip pad 30 introduced into a cavity (not shown) in handle<br>
12 by a conventional process of injection moulding.<br>
Referring to Figs. 2-5, alternative constructions of the toothbrush head of this<br>
invention are shown.<br>
In Fig. 2 a head similar to that of Fig. 1 is shown enlarged in perspective (Figs.<br>
2A, 2B), and in underside (Fig 2C), side (Fig. 2D) and plan (Fig. 2E) views. It is seen<br>
that the middle section 15 has a widened intermediate pad 152 occupying the<br>
longitudinal half of section 15 closer to the handle, and a narrower first link region<br>
151 between pad 152 and tip pad 18. Also, which may be independent of other<br>
features of Fig. 2, the face 19 of pad 18, from which bristles extend, forms an angle<br>
less than 180° with the adjacent face of first link region 151. In Fig. 2 the pad 18 is<br>
polygonal, approximately pentagonal, in plan. A second link region 153 links the<br>
intermediate pad 152 to the neck 21.<br>
In Fig. 3 (Fig. 3A perspective plan view, Fig. 3B underside view, Fig. 3C side<br>
view, Fig. 3D plan view) a similar construction is shown, except that the face 19 of tip<br>
pad 18, from which bristles extend is coplanar with the adjacent first link region 151<br>
from which bristles extend. Again the middle section 15 is widened between the link<br>
regions to form an intermediate pad 15 B. Also, independently of this, bristle surfaces<br>
21 of the lateral section 16,17 are of undulating shape as viewed in the width<br>
direction W-W.<br>
In Fig. 4 a head similar to that of Fig. 1 is shown enlarged in side view Fig.<br>
4A, perspective Fig. 4B, and in plan view Fig. 4C. It is seen that the middle section 15<br>
has an end adjacent to the tip end of the head integrally enlarged to form a bristle-<br>
carrying tip pad 18 which extends across the entire width of the toothbrush head<br>
adjacent to the tip end 13A. This tip pad 18 is generally circular in plan, having in its<br>
longitudinal direction a length of ca. 20-30% of the toothbrush head between its tip<br>
end 13B and its base end 13A.<br><br>
The tip pad 18 is of a size suitable to cany a polygonal cluster of tufts 20 in<br>
the form of a polygonal pattern of tufts around a central tuft. As seen in Fig. 4A the<br>
bristle carrying surface 19 of the tip pad 18 forms an angle of less than 180° with the<br>
surface of the adjacent first link region 152 of the middle section 15 closer to the<br>
handle, and the tip pad 19 extends longitudinally beyond the ends of the lateral<br>
sections 16,17 remotest from the handle.<br>
In the toothbrush head of Fig. 4 the middle section 15 comprises a single<br>
intermediate bristle carrying pad 151 being a region of maximum width of the part of<br>
the section 15 between the tip pad 18 and the base end 13 A of the head, from which<br>
plural tufts of bristles 20 extend, being arranged in a polygonal cluster surrounding<br>
two central tufts. The intermediate pad 151 is oval in plan (except where interrupted<br>
by the link regions to be described) and has an area in plan similar to the tip pad 19.<br>
The intermediate pad 151 has a length ca. 20-30% of the length of the toothbrush head<br>
between the tip end 13B and the base end 13 A of the head. The intermediate pad 151<br>
is located within the longitudinal half of the head closest to the handle. The widest<br>
part of the intermediate pad 151 is closer to the base end 13 of the head than to the tip<br>
end 13B of the head.<br>
There is an integral first link region 152 between the tip pad 18 and the<br>
intermediate pad 151 being narrower in width than the adjacent part of the tip pad 19<br>
and the intermediate pad 151.<br>
There is a second link region 153 between the intermediate pad 151 and the<br>
base end 13 of the head being narrower in width than the adjacent part of the<br>
intermediate pad 151, and integrally linked to neck 21. It is seen that there are<br>
inflexion points, i.e. of greatest curvature, defining the junctions between the pads 18,<br>
151 and the link regions 152, 153. In Fig. 4 each of the link regions 152, 153 is<br>
parallel sided as seen in plan. The length of the first link region 152 between the tip<br>
pad 18 and the intermediate pad 151 is longer than the length, of both the tip pad 18<br>
and the intermediate pad 151.<br>
It is seen that the majority of the bristle tufts 20 on the middle section 15 are<br>
located on the tip pad 18 and intermediate pad 151, i.e. as seen in Fig. 4C there are ten<br>
tufts on the intermediate pad 151, seven tufts on the tip pad 18, and six tufts on the<br>
link regions 152, 153.<br><br><br>
Referring to Fig. 5, this shows in more detail a plan view of a preferred<br>
construction of toothbrush head 11 of this invention, with three sections 15,16,17<br>
each of which is integrally linked to a respective neck 21,22, 23 which is in turn<br>
integrally linked to the grip handle 12, of which the part closest to the head 11 is<br>
shown. It can be seen that the construction of head is similar to that of Fig. 4, i.e. with<br>
the middle section comprising a tip pad 18, an intermediate pad. 151, a first link region<br>
152 and a second link region 153. Bristles 20 are shown in a non-limiting<br>
representative pattern disposed on the sections of head 11.<br>
The surface 19 of tip pad 18 forms an angle less than 180° with the adjacent<br>
surface of first link region 152 at the fold line 24. Tip pad 18 is approximately circular<br>
7.5mm in diameter. First link region 151 is ca. 9-10 mm long and 2-3 mm wide.<br>
Intermediate pad 152 is oval, ca. 9-10 mm long and 7-8 mm wide. Second link region<br>
153 is ca. 5-7 mm long and ca. 2-3mm wide. The thickness of the sections is ca. 3-4<br>
mm. Necks 21,22,23 are ca. 23-25mm long and 2-3mm wide. The lateral necks 22,<br>
23 are ca. 3-4 mm thick and middle neck 21 is slightly thicker, ca. 4-5mm. The head<br>
11 is overall of a generally oval shape tapering toward the tip end and has a total<br>
length ca. 30-32 mm, and a width at its widest point widthways adjacent intermediate<br>
pad 152 of ca. 13mm i.e. conventionally sized. When made in these dimensions of<br>
typical plastics materials such as polypropylene, polyamide, ABS, fibre-reinforced<br>
polypropylene etc. suitable flexibility is achieved.<br>
The gaps 25 between the necks 21,22,23 taper toward the tip end 13B, being<br>
ca. 0.5 - 1mm at the end closest to the handle 12, and tapering such that the sections<br>
15,16,17 are in sliding contact. Parts of the necks 21,22,23 adjacent to the base end<br>
13A of the head 11 may also be in sliding contact. The handle 12 also incorporates an<br>
elastomeric grip pad 30, and the flexible elastomer material 31 extends into the gaps<br>
25 adjacent to the handle 12.<br>
It is seen in Figs. 1-5 that as seen in plan view the outer envelope of the head<br>
11 shows a shallow concavity at 154 longitudinally distanced from the tip end 13B, of<br>
a shape designed such that if pad 18 contacts a tooth surface and moves longitudinally<br>
in the base-tip direction a tooth or other oral tissue surface is unlikely to catch in the<br>
gap between the tip pad 18 and section 16 or 17., e.g. to thereby force the sections<br><br>
15,16,17 apart. A smooth transition in this area of the envelope is desirable for this<br>
reason.<br>
Referring to Fig. 6, a cross section through the head 11 of Fig. 5 is shown, cut<br>
at line A- -A of Fig. 5. It is seen how the bristles 20 are set in bristle holes 26 in the<br>
sections 15, 16,17 or otherwise moulded into the head in a conventional manner. It is<br>
seen how under the action of pressure on the bristle, shown by the arrow, experienced<br>
during toothbrushing, the sections 15,16,17 can move resiliently out of a plane<br>
parallel to the longitudinal and width directions. In Fig. 6 the gap between the sections<br>
15,16,17 is shown exaggerated for clarity, the sections 15,16,17 actually being in<br>
contact allowing relative sliding movement between widthways adjacent segments.<br><br>
