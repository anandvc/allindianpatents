Description<br>
Title: Plastic removal valve for containers for transporting and storing liquids<br>
The invention relates to a plastic removal valve for containers for transporting and storing liquids, the valve being designed as a butterfly or ball valve and having a valve housing with an inlet nozzle, which can be connected to the outlet nozzle of the liquid container, and with an outlet nozzle, which is welded to the male part of a Kamlok coupling for the connection of a removal hose (DE 298 24 096.3 Ul) .<br>
Butterfly-valve-design removal valves of the generic type are used, for example, in liquid containers which are known from DE 195 11 723 CI, these being equipped with a pallet-like substructure, an exchangeable plastic inner container with four side walls, a lower and an upper base, an introduction nozzle and an outlet nozzle and with an outer casing which encloses the inner container and is designed as a sheet-metal casing or lattice casing made of vertical and horizontal metal lattice bars.<br>
In the case of the butterfly valve described in DE 298 24 096.3 Ul, the valve housing and the Kamlok-coupling male part welded to the outlet nozzle thereof consist of a high-density polyethylene (HDPE). This plastic provides the valve housing and the male part of the Kamlok coupling with limited elasticity which, in the case of the valve housing, is desirable in order to achieve a sealed closure position of the valve disc but, in the case of the male part of the Kamlok coupling, has the disadvantage that, as a result of the Kamlok-coupling female part, which is fastened on the connection end of an emptying hose, being clamped firmly on the slightly elastically deforming male part<br><br>
by means of the clamping levers fitted on the female part, sealed connection of the emptying hose is not ensured with the desired level of reliability.<br>
The object of the invention is for the Kamlok coupling used in the case of the removal valve of the generic type for liquid containers, and is intended for connecting an emptying hose to the valve housing, to be developed further in respect of optimum sealing.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by a removal valve having the features of Patent Claim 1.<br>
The subclaim contains an advantageous development of the removal valve.<br>
The novel removal valve embodies a straightforward and expedient solution of the object on which the invention is based.<br>
The invention is explained hereinbelow with reference to figures, in which:<br>
Figure 1  illustrates a butterfly valve in longitudinal<br>
section, and<br>
Figure 2  illustrates an end view of  the butterfly valve.<br>
The valve housing 2 of the butterfly valve 1, this housing being produced from high-density polyethylene (HDPE) , accommodates a valve disc 3 for opening and closing the central throughflow opening 4 of the housing chamber 5, which is connected to the inlet channel 6 of the inlet nozzle 7, and the outlet channel 8 of the outlet nozzle 9, of the valve housing 2. The valve disc 3 is fastened eccentrically on a rotary shaft 10, of which one end 10a is mounted in a rotatable manner in the valve housing 2 and the other<br><br>
end 10b projects outwards, out of the valve housing 2, via a bearing nozzle 11. The rotary shaft 10 is sealed in the outward direction by means of sealing rings 12 in the connection nozzle 11. A handle 13 for opening and closing the butterfly valve 1 is fitted at the end 10b of the rotary shaft 10, this end projecting out of the valve housing 2.<br>
The butterfly valve 1 is fastened on the outlet nozzle 15 of a liquid container 16, e.g. a plastic inner container of a pallet container, by means of a union nut 14, it being the case that, during blow moulding of the liquid container, the outlet nozzle, which is prefabricated as a plastic injection moulding, is positioned in the blow mould and attached to the liquid container by blow moulding.<br>
A plastic adapter ring 17, which is adhesively bonded or welded to the inlet nozzle 7 of the valve housing 2, serves, on the one hand, as a rotation-prevention means for the valve housing 2, which is inserted into the outlet nozzle 15 of the liquid container 16 by way of the inlet nozzle 7, and, on the other hand, for positioning the valve housing 2 when the latter is pushed into the outlet nozzle 15 of the liquid container 16 by way of the inlet nozzle 7.<br>
When the union nut 14, which is seated in captive fashion on the inlet nozzle 7 of the valve housing 2, is screwed onto the outlet nozzle 15 of the liquid container 16, said outlet nozzle being provided with a corresponding external thread 18, a sealing ring 19, which is arranged on the inlet nozzle 7 of the v^lve housing 2, is clamped in between a collar 20 of the inlet nozzle 7, on which the union nut 14 acts by way of an annular extension 21, and the end surface 22 of the outlet nozzle 15 of the liquid container 16, and a liquid-tight connection is thus achieved between the butterfly valve 1 and the liquid container 16.<br><br>
The male part 23 of a Kamlok coupling, for the connection of a removal-hose connection end provided with the corresponding female part, is welded to the outlet nozzle 9 of the valve housing 2. The male part 23 is produced as an injection moulding from a glass-fibre-reinforced high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The outer end 24 of the male part 23 has an external thread 25 for the screw connection of a protective cap 26 during transportation of the liquid container 16.<br>
The high-density polyethylene plastic provides the valve housing 2 with limited elasticity, which allows a sealed closure position of the valve disc 3 of the butterfly valve 1 by elastic expansion of the valve seat of the valve housing 2 in the closure position of the valve disc 3.<br>
The hardness of the high-density polyethylene material of the Kamlok-coupling male part 23 welded to the outlet nozzle 9 of the valve housing 2, said hardness being produced by the mixture of glass fibres, allows a sealed connection between the butterfly valve 1 and an emptying hose, at the connection end of which is fastened the Kamiok-coupling female part, which is clamped firmly on the male part by means of clamping levers articulated on it.<br>
A constriction 27 of the outlet nozzle 9 of the valve housing 2 causes the limited-elasticity valve housing 2 and rigid Kamlok-coupling male part 23 to be isolated from one another, with the result that the different material properties which are desired for the valve housing and the Kamlok-coupling male part do not disadvantageously influence one another.<br>
The above design principle described for butterfly valves can also be used for ball valves.<br><br><br><br><br>
1.	Plastic removal valve for containers for transporting and storing liquids, the valve being designed as a butterfly or ball valve and having a valve housing with an inlet nozzle, which can be connected to the outlet nozzle of the liquid container, and with an outlet nozzle, which is welded to the male part of a Kamlok coupling for the connection of a removal hose, characterized in that the valve housing (2) consists of a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and the male part (23) of the Kamlok coupling consists of a glass-fibre-reinforced high-density polyethylene.<br>
2.	Removal valve according to Claim 1, characterized in that the outlet nozzle (9) of the valve housing (2) has a constriction (27).<br><br>
3. Plastic removal valve for containers for transporting and storing liquids, substantially as hereinabove described and illustrated with reference to the accompanying drawing.<br><br></td>
