SLMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventor has discovered a high pressure catalyst activation method that produces fluormation catalyst which provide enhanced yield when fluorinating organic compounds and enhanced longevity ot the catalyst.<br>
Applicant has discovered a process for activating a fluorination catalyst precursor, which comprises drying the catalyst precursor and thereafter exposing the dried catalyst precursor to an activating agent under high pressure conditions.   Activation of the catalyst precursor with an activating agent at higher pressures produces a catalytically active compound which exhibits enhance activity and catalyst lite.<br>
As used herein, the term "catalytically active compound" is intended to reter to compounds that catalyze tluorination of organic compounds and to compounds that can be converted, by the present process, to such compounds. It is to be understood that this term encompasses not only fresh, unused catalyticalh active compounds but also compounds that have been previously used as a tluorination catalyst and subsequently can be regenerated and/or reactivated by the present process<br>
As used herein, the term "substantial thermal stability" is intended to reter tc conditions in which the rate of change of temperature has slowed to a substantial extent, and preferably is substantially constant tor a measurable peiu)d of time, under adiabatic conditions. In other words, a catal&gt;st has reached "substantial thermal stability" when the rate of heat generation during the conditioning step is substantially reduced, and preferably is substantially zeru As explained in more detail hereinafter.<br><br>
the preferred activating step of the present invention result in an exothermic reaction involving the catalyst, and "substantial thermal stability" is achieved when such exotherm is substantially dissipated.<br>
According to one preferred embodiment, the high pressure activating step comprises exposing a catalyst precursor compound to an activating agent composition that comprises an activating compound and an inert carrier at high pressure, preferably the concentration of the activating compound in the activating agent composirion increases during at least a portion of the activating step.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the activation of a tluonnation catalyst precursor h\ exposing catalyst precursor compound(s) to drying and thereafter an actrvating agent composition at high pressures. The tenn "untreated catalyst precursor compounds" is used herein in its broad sense to designate a precursor oi a catalylicaily active compound, which will be subjected to the process steps of the present unention. Thus, the term "untreated catalyst precursor compounds " is intended to include within its meaning not only fresh, untreated catalyst precursor compounds, but also to such compounds which have previously been treated by the present invention and/or by other treatment operations and are to be regenerated and'or reactivated,<br>
A large number of potentially catalytically active precursor compounds are known, and it is contemplated that all such compounds can be treated in accordance with the processes of the present invention to produce fluorination catalyst. According to preferred embodiments, fluorination catalysts prepared in accordance with the present invention are compounds that are catalytically active in the reaction of hydrogen fluoride (HF) with halogenated hydrocarbons, preferably chlorinated hydrocarbons<br><br>
(CHCs) such as chloroalkanes and chloroalkenes.  Fluonnation catalysts prepared in accordance with the present invention are suitable for the fluorination of chloroalkanes and/or chloroalkenes to hydrochlorotluorocarbons (HCFCs) and/or hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Fluonnation catalysts prepared in accordance with the present invention are also suitable for the tluorination of HCFCs to HFC s. fhe present method finds particularly advantageous utility in the preparation of catalysts for the tluorination of chlorinated olefins, and particularly perchlorinated olefins, such as perchloroethylene (PCE) or trichloroethylene (TCE) to hyrofluorcarbons ( HFCs) such as pentatluoroethane (HFC--125) or tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a),<br>
Suitable catalyst precursor compounds of the present invention are well known in the art and include various inorganic compounds   For example oxides, halides. nitrates. sulfates and the like of metals such as aluminum, cobalt, manganese, iron, zinc, chromium or mixtures thereof. Fhe present mvention is particularlv wcil suited for the preparation of chromium-based catalysts<br>
Chromium based fluorination catalysts are typically and preferabh based more specifically upon chromia. The chromia may be. for example, lluonnated so that the fluorination catalyst is a chromium oxyfluoride species. Furthermore the chromia may comprise activity promoting amounts of other metals, for example zinc, nickel, cobalt, manganese, magnesium or mixtures thereof the chromia-based catalyst may be supported on a support system. Fhe support system may be. tor example a metal oxide such as alumina (A12O3), magnesia (MgO), a metal fluoride, tor example aluminum fluoride and magnesium fluoride or the support system may be an activated carbon, or HF activated carbon.<br>
The present methods can be carried out m a wide variety of environments and in batch, continuous, and/or semi-continuous operations. It is generally preferred. however, that the methods are carried out in continuous or semi-continuous operations.<br>
'Fhe catalyst precursor compounds to be processed in accordance with the present invention can be provided substantially free of water or preferably they are subjected to a drying step, which preferably produces a compound substantially free of unbound<br><br>
water. The drying step preferably comprises passing a drying gas, preferably nitrogen, over and in intimate contact with the untreated catalyst precursor so as to carry away a substantial portion of any unbound water present in, on or otherwise associated with the untreated catalyst. The drying step can be carried out at a pressure of from atmospheric up to 300 psig. The temperature of the catalyst precursor compound during the drying step can range from room temperature up to about 400° C, preferably from about 100° to about 200° C at a contact time of from about 1 to 100 seconds, preferably from about 10 to 40 seconds, for approximately 1-50 hours, preferably between 5-20 hours. An in-line moisture analyzer can be used to monitor the water content of the effluent stream.<br>
Any heating means known in the art may be used to heat the catalyst precursor compound to the indicated ranges. For example, the catalyst precursor compound may be heated directly by heating the drying gas or indirectly by heating the vessel containing the catalyst precursor compound.<br>
The present method includes exposing the dried precursor compound, to an activating agent in a single high pressure-activating step. The single high pressure activating step is carried out at a pressure of above about 100 psig, preferably from about 200 psig to about 400 psig. The temperature of the single high pressure activation step can range from about 100° to about 400° C, preferably between about 200° and about 300° C.<br>
The activating agent is preferably HP. The HF can be fed to the system as a gas or a liquid and is preferably fed with an inert carrier gas such as nitrogen.   The proportion of HF to nitrogen can range from about 1 -20 mole % HF in nitrogen. The preferred single step high pressure activation with HF results in tluorination of the catalyst precursor compound which results in the generation of water and of heat. The single high pressure activation step preferably includes removing from the catalyst both the heat and the water generated during the single high pressure activation step. Other activating agents such as hydrochlorofluorocarbons; for example CF3CH2CI (HCFC-133a), CHCIF2 (HCFC-22), CF3CHCI2 (HCFC-123), CH2CIF { HCFC-31), and/ or hydrofluorocarbons; for example CF3CH2F (HFC-134a), CF3CH3 (HFC-143a) and CF2H2 (HFC-32) and the like can be used as activators. Unlike HF. when HCFCs or<br><br>
HFCs are used as activating agents, water is not formed or diluted water with other coproduct such as CO2 and/or CO is formed. The use of an activating agent other them HF can result in less corrosion to the equipment. Also, an activation process using an activating agent other than HF can be carried out as an in-situ activation.<br>
Numerous heat and water removal techniques can be used in accordance with the present invention, and all such steps are encompassed within the scope hereof. With respect to the water removal step, it is preferred that the water is removed as a feature of the activation step. For example, it is preferred that the high pressure activating gas is maintained in intimate contact with the catalyst for a time sufficient to not only activate the catalyst but also to allow a substantial portion of the generated water to be desorbed by, entrained in, or otherwise carried away by the activating gas. Removal of the activating gas from the catalyst also then results in removal of water from the catalyst. Similarly, the heat can be removed from the catalyst by allowing the activating gas to work as a heat absorber. In addition, other techniques can be used to remove the heat of the exothermic reaction from the catalyst, such as external cooling of the vessel containing the catalyst.<br>
It is also generally preferred that the high pressure activating step is conducted as a continuous process in which the activating gas is passed over and m intimate contact with the catalyst and then removed from the catalyst by passing the gas through the vessel containing the catalyst. In such embodiments, the residence time that the high pressure activating gas is in contact with the catalyst can vary widely depending on numerous factors associated each individual application, such as the type and amount of the catalyst, the type and amount of activating gas, and like factors. In general, the contact time of the HF and nitrogen can vary between 10 and 100 seconds. The high pressure activation is continued until water evolution ceases and the exotherm is dissipate, i.e. steady state conditions. The process can take up to 30 hours. The HF contact time is the time that the HF gas is physically in contact with the catalyst bed, and is sometime called to residence time. The total catalyst volume/total gas flow, adjusted to the operating temperature and pressure measures contact time. The process time is how long the HF gas, and any other gases have been continuously feed to the reactor at the operating conditions.<br><br>
The dry activated catalyst can be used for the fluorination of HCFCs such as 133a, 123 and 31 etc; to the corresponding HFC, 134a, 125 and 32 respectively. The catalyst can also be used for the gas phase fluorination of chloroalkenes such as vinyl chloride to 152a, vinylidene chloride to 141b, 142b and 143a, trichloroethylene to 133a/134a and /or perchloroethylene to CF3CHCI2 (HCFC 123), CF3CHCIF (HCFC 124) and CF3CHF2 (HFC 125). The fluorination process can be carried out at temperature ranging form about 100° to 400'C and preferably between about 200" to 300°C. The operating pressure can be varied between atmospheric pressure and 400 psig and is preferably between about 100 to 300 psig. The contact time is not critical and can range from about 4 to 20 seconds. The molar ratio of HF to organic being fluorinated ranges from about 1/1 to 10/1.  The most preferred ratio ranges from about 2/1 to 5/1 of HF/organic. To maintain the catalyst lifetime for extended periods of time, it is recommended to maintain low levels of oxygen in the form of air as a co-feed together with the organic. The amount of oxygen can range from about 0.1 to 2% of the organic co-feed preferably from about 0.1 to 1 %. In some processes, where food grade HCl is recovered as a co-product, it is desirable to co-feed zero air or a minimum amount of air. Processes known in the art such as distillation, extractive distillations and / or adsorption using a solid adsorbent can recover the HCl co-product.<br>
The present invention is illustrated in more detail in the following non-limiting examples.<br>
Example 1: Atmospheric Pressure Cr203 Catalyst Activation:<br>
Twenty cc's (27.6 grams) of a commercially available chromium oxide (Cr203) catalyst (E-410 available from Engelhard) in the form of 1/8"x1/8" cylinders was loaded into a l"xl2", vertical fixed bed reactor made out of Hastelloy C. The reactor was heated using a three-zone electric tube furnace. The reactor inlet fittings included fittings for HF gas, organic feed, air and nitrogen. Liquid HF feed was measured and controlled using a liquid mass flow meter controller. The liquid HF was vaporized using a pre-heater prior to feeding to the reactor. The organic (HCFC-133a) was fed using a high pressure ISCO pump. Nitrogen and air feed were controlled and<br><br>
measured using gas mass flow meter controllers. The catalyst bed was first dried by heating to 150°C in the presence of a nitrogen feed flowing at 50 ccm, for 18 hours. Subsequently a mixture of HF and nitrogen was fed to the dried catalyst bed at atmospheric pressure. The ratio of HF to nitrogen was varied and the operating temperature was increased over time as shown in Table 1<br>
Table. 1. Chromium Oxide (Engelhard E-410) Catalyst Activation<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
After activating the catalyst for 18 hours. The physically adsorbed HF was desorbed at 350°C, using nitrogen flow at 100 ccm for 18 hours. The dry activated catalyst was unloaded and analyzed for the fluorine content, surface area (SA), pore volume (PV)<br><br>

and Cr   content. Table 2 summarizes the analytical results.<br><br>

Thirteen cc's of the activated catalyst was reloaded into the reactor and subjected to additional fluorination at the operating pressure 162 psi at 350°C using HF feed at 8 g/hr together with nitrogen co-feed at 100 ccm for ½ hr. When the exotherm resulting from the reaction dissipated a process feed comprising 12g/hr of HF, air at 2.5 ccm, organic (HCFC-133a) at 0.45 ccm (90.98% pure) began. These feed conditions<br><br>
correspond to 2/1 molar ratio of HF/HCFC-133a, O2 0.5% based upon HCFC-133a and a contact time of 12 seconds. The organic product obtained from the reactor together with HCl co-product and excess HP was scrubbed using 17% KOH solution, dried with anhydrous CaSO4 and analyzed using Gas Chromatograph. Conversion of HCFC-133a to HFC-134 was 10% and selectivity for HCFC-134a was 93.7%, as shown in Table 3. Numbers are reported in moles percent.<br>

Examples 2-4. Evaluation of high pressure activated Cr2O3 catalyst<br>
A high pressure catalyst activation process m accordance with the present invention was carried out as follows. The reactor was loaded with 12.38 kg of chromium oxide catalyst precursor. The catalyst precursor was dried at 350°C using a nitrogen flow of 1 liter/minute at atmospheric pressure for 18 hours. The dried catalyst was thereafter pressurized to 235psig using nitrogen and the temperature raised to 350°C. Thereafter, a mixture of HF at 3 g/m and nitrogen at 7 liters/mmute was fed over the catalyst bed in such away that the temperature resulting from the reaction exotherm did not exceed 370°C. After the exotherm dissipated, pure HF at 3 g/minute was fed over the catalyst bed for 18 hours. The activated catalyst was analyzed. The chemical and physical properties of the activated catalyst are summarized in Table 4.<br>

(Formula Removed) <br>
Thirteen cc's of the high-pressure activated catalyst was loaded into the vertical reactor described in Example 1. A mixture of HF and nitrogen was fed over the catalyst bed at the pressures and feed rates shown in Table 5, no exothenn was observed.<br>

The catalyst was evaluated using the same feed conditions as Example 1 (HCFC-133a at 0 .45 ccm, HF at 12 g/hr, air at 2.5 ccm) at a temperature of 350°C and a pressure of 162 psi. These feed conditions correspond to 2/1 molar ratio of HF to HCFC-133a, O2 to organic ratio of 0.5% and a contact time 12 seconds. Conversion of the HCFC-133a obtained was nearly 18 % and selectivity of 134a was approximately 99%.<br>
The contact time was than lowered to 7.8 seconds. Example 3. The conversion remained very high at 18% and the selectivity for HCFC-34a was near 99%. When contact time was fiirther lowered to 5.6 seconds. Then, conversion decreased to<br>
11.3% and selectivity for HCFC-134a dropped to 96.6%, Example 4. These results are summarized in Table 6.<br>
