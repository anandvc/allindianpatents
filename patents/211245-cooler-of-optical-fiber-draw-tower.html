				<td>COOLER OF OPTICAL FIBER DRAW TOWER<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an optical fiber draw tower, and more particularly, to a cooler of an optical fiber draw tower, capable of fast cooling optical fiber melted in a melting furnace and then drawn in a predetermined diameter before coating is applied.<br>
Background Art<br>
In general, optical fibers are obtained by drawing a preform for optical fibers using an optical fiber draw tower. FIG. 1 is a schematic view of a general optical fiber draw tower. The optical fiber draw tower comprises a melting furnace 12 for melting a preform 10 at a high temperature to draw out uncoated optical fiber 14, a diameter measuring unit 16 installed below the melting furnace 12, for continuously measuring the outer diameter of the uncoated optical fiber to uniformly control the outer diameter of the uncoated optical fiber, a cooling unit 18 below the diameter measuring unit 16, for cooling down the temperature of the uncoated optical fiber 14 to room temperature, a coating unit 20 below the cooling unit 18, for coating the surface of the uncoated optical fiber with UV-curable resin such as acryl resin or silicon resin so as to protect the uncoated optical fiber 14 from the elements of nature, a curing unit 22 below the coating unit 20, for curing the coated optical fiber 24, a capstan 26 below the curing unit 22, for drawing out an optical fiber from the preform 10 in a lower direction, and a spool 28 next to the capstan 26, for winding the drawn optical fiber.<br>
A method for preparing (drawing) an optical fiber coated with the UV-curable resin will be described. The preform 10 is slowly provided into the melting furnace 12 according to the position control mechanism of a preform position controller (not shown). Here, the preform 10 is heated in the melting furnace 12 to several thousands of centigrades, typically, to 2,100~2,200°C. As a result, the uncoated optical fiber 14 is drawn from the preform 10. Here, drawing force originates from the capstan 26 and is applied to the uncoated optical fiber 14. Then, the diameter measuring unit 16 measures the outer diameter of the uncoated<br>
optical fiber 14 drawn to determine whether the diameter is equal to a predetermined diameter, e.g., 125µm, and sends the measured diameter values to a diameter controller (not shown). The diameter controller controls the rotating speed of the capstan 26 such that the diameter of the uncoated optical fiber 14 is maintained at 125µm. Then, the capstan 26 rotates to control the drawing force on the uncoated optical fiber 14 in response to the control of the diameter controller, thereby drawing out the uncoated optical fiber 14 in a lower direction.<br>
Then, in order to protect the uncoated optical fiber 14 cooled at high speed by the cooling unit 18, the coating unit 20 coats the surface of the falling down uncoated optical fiber 14 with a UV-curable resin, e.g, acryl resin or silicon resin. Then, the optical fiber 24 coated with the UV-curable resin is cured by the curing unit 22, and is then wound around the spool 26 under the control of drawing force of the capstan 26.<br>
Also, as the preform becomes large, the optical fiber draw tower must be increased. This is because very rapid drawing is necessary as the preform becomes large. After the preform is melted passing through a melting furnace and then drawn out, the drawn optical fiber is subjected to coating. Here, prior to coating of the optical fiber, the temperature of the uncoated optical fiber must be lowered to a predetermined temperature. In general, the temperature of the uncoated optical fiber right drawn from the melting furnace is 2,000°C or more. However, in order to guarantee stable coating on the drawn optical fiber, the temperature of the uncoated optical fiber must be cooled to at least 40°C or less (usually to room temperature). For this purpose, the temperature of the uncoated optical fiber is cooled rapidly using a cooler. However, the cooler in use is not sufficient to cool trie uncoated optical fiber to keep pace with the rapid drawing speed. FIG. 2 shows a general cooler adopted by the optical fiber draw tower shown in FIG. 1. In the cooler having a pipe shape, the drawn optical fiber is cooled by filling the pipe with helium (He).<br>
Thus, it is necessary to increase the height of the optical fiber draw tower in order to quickly cool the uncoated optical fiber in response to the rapid drawing speed of the optical fiber. However, making the optical fiber draw tower high increases the manufacturing cost and it is not efficient.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
To solve the above problems, it is an object of the present invention to provide a cooler of an optical fiber draw tower, capable of rapidly cooling an optical fiber which is melted in a melting furnace and then drawn, without increasing the height of a conventional optical fiber draw tower, such that the<br><br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
A peltier effect refers to the change in temperature when current flows across two different materials contacting each other. A small solid state device, such as a heat pump, based on the Peltier effect, is called a "thermo-electric cooler<br>
(TEC)".    FIG. 5 shows an example of the TEC, in which p-type and n-type semiconductor pairs are arranged in series between two ceramic plates.<br>
The basic idea of the present invention is to construct a cooler used in a optical fiber draw tower using the TEC. FIG. 3 shows a cooler of an optical fiber draw tower according to the present invention, which adopts the TEC to double the cooling effect. The basic module includes two TECs 300, two rods 310, and an auxiliary cooler consisting of three units 320, 330 and 340 which is attached to each heat-emitting surface of the TECs 300. FIG. 4 is a top view of the cooler shown in FIG. 3. The cooler shown in FIG. 3 is constituted of two or more basic modules connected to each other, and an insulating material 350 interposed between the basic modules. Here, the height of the cooler can be controlled by the number of basic modules adopted.<br>
The TEC 300 is a heat exchanger for generating heat by taking electrical     H energy through power supply lines 360.   The TEC is installed to surround the optical fiber drawn from the melting furnace 12 of FIG. 1.  That is, the TECs 300 are arranged so that their heat absorbing surfaces face each other around the optical fiber drawn from the melting furnace 12.   Also, fins may be attached so as to enhance the cooling effect at the heat absorbing surfaces of the TECs 300.<br>
Also, the rods 310 act as a spacer for separating the facing TECs 300 by a predetermined interval.<br>
An optical fiber 370 passes through the space enclosed by two TECs 300 and two rods 310 in the vertical direction, and a coolant is supplied to the space to further lower the temperature of the optical fiber 370. The coolant may be helium (He), argon (Ar) or nitrogen (N). In this embodiment, He or Ar is used as the coolant.<br>
Here, the three units constituting the auxiliary cooler which adopts a water cooling* system are a tank 320 in which a heat exchange medium flowing path is formed, a supply pipe 340 attached to the tank 320, for supplying the heat exchange medium through the heat exchange medium flowing path to the tank 320, and an exhaust pipe 330 for exhausting the heat exchange medium. In this embodiment, water is used as the heat exchange medium. However, any medium capable of exchanging heat, e.g., oil, may be used in some cases. Also, fins may be attached<br>
to the tank 320 to enhance its cooling effect. An auxiliary cooler adopting an air cooling system, in which air is supplied using a fan for cooling, may be used. That is, the cooling system adopted by the auxiliary cooler is not limited to the above embodiment according to the present invention.<br>
The insulating material 350 blocks the heat transfer from an upper basic module to a lower basic module, thereby enhancing the cooling efficiency of each basic module of the cooler. The insulating material 350 used in this embodiment<br>
*<br>
is styrofoam.  However, the insulating material is not limited to a specific material.<br>
The cooler illustrated in this embodiment has a hexahedral shape, and the uncoated optical fiber 370 drawn from a melting furnace is surrounded using two TECs 300 and two rods 310. Preferably, two TECs are used in place of the two rods 310. More preferably, the cooler is formed using a tubular TEC. That is, the cooler can be modified into various shapes without limitations. Also, the number of basic modules adopted by the cooler may be different. That is, in the case where the length of the TEC is sufficient to cool the uncoated optical fiber drawn from the melting furnace keeping pace with the drawing speed, the cooler may be constituted of only one basic module.<br>
FIG. 6 shows positions a, b and c at which temperatures are measured to illustrate the cooling effect according to distance from the preform. Reference character a indicates the bottom line of the preform, and reference characters b and c indicate the positions separated from the bottom line a by 100cm and 200cm, respectively. Here, the cooler is located between the positions b and c. Also, T indicates the temperature of the preform, and T1 and T2 indicate the temperatures of the drawn optical fiber at the positions b and c, respectively.<br>
FIG. 7 is a plot showing the temperature Tl of the drawn optical fiber at the position b of FIG. 6 according a drawing speed Vf. FIG. 8 is a plot showing the temperature T2 of the drawn optical fiber at the position c of FIG. 6 according the drawing speed Vf.<br>
FIG. 9 is a plot illustrating the change in temperature (log(r, - T2)) of the optical fiber according to the time t required for the preform of the position a to be drawn as an optical fiber to reach the position c. Here, the time t is calculated<br><br>
L<br>
by —, wherein L, the distance between the positions b and c, is 200cm.   In the Vf<br>
legend of FIG. 9, "He9", "He6", "He3" and "Hel.5" indicate the cases when He as a coolant flows through the cooler at a flowing rate of 9, 6, 3 and 1.5 liters per minute, respectively, while the cooler adopting only the TEC operates. "Air" indicates the case where the cooler is not operated and no coolant is provided, "ONLY He3" indicates the case where only He is supplied at a flowing rate of 9 liters per minute while the operation of the cooler is stopped, and "Ar3" indicates the case where Ar is supplied as the coolant at a flowing rate of 3 liters per minute while the cooler is operated.<br>
