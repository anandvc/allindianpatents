PROCESS FOR PRODUCING A TRANSPARENT OPTICAL ELEMENT,<br>
OPTICAL COMPONENT INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS AND OPTICAL<br>
ELEMENT THUS OBTAINED<br>
The present invention relates to the production of<br>
transparent elements incorporating optical functions.<br>
It applies especially to the production of ophthalmic<br>
lenses having various optical properties.<br>
Ametropia-correcting lenses are conventionally<br>
manufactured by shaping a transparent material having a<br>
refractive index higher than that of air. The shape of<br>
the lenses is chosen so that the refraction at the<br>
material/air interfaces causes suitable focussing onto<br>
the retina of the wearer. The lens is generally cut so<br>
as to fit into a spectacle frame, with appropriate<br>
positioning relative to the pupil of the corrected eye.<br>
It is known to vary the refractive index within the<br>
material of an ophthalmic lens, thereby making it<br>
possible to limit the geometrical constraints (see for<br>
example EP-A-0 728 572) . This method was proposed above<br>
all for contact lenses. The index gradient is obtained<br>
for example by diffusion, selective irradiation or<br>
selective heating during the manufacture of the solid<br>
object constituting the lens. Although this provides<br>
for manufacture for each treatable case of ametropia,<br>
the method does not lend itself well to mass<br>
production. Otherwise, it is possible to manufacture,<br>
on an industrial scale, series of objects of graded<br>
index, to select that one which is closest to the one<br>
suitable for an eye to be corrected, and to carry out a<br>
re-shaping operation on it, by machining and polishing,<br>
in order to adapt it to this eye. In this case, the<br>
need to carry out a re-shaping operation on the lenses<br>
means that a great deal of the attraction of the method<br>
over the conventional methods is lost.<br><br>
of between 0.10 µm and 5 µm. In a first embodiment of<br>
the invention, the walls have a thickness of between<br>
0.10 µm and 5 µm, and preferably between 0.10 µm and<br>
0.35 µm, so that they also produce virtually no<br>
undesirable diffractive effects in the visible<br>
spectrum. Such thin walls may provide a very high fill<br>
factor τ of the optical surface with the substance<br>
having a beneficial optical effect .<br>
In a second embodiment, the walls have a thickness of<br>
between 0.40 µm and 2.00 µm. For example, this<br>
thickness may be equal to 1.00 µm. In a third<br>
embodiment, the walls have a thickness of between<br>
2.00 µm and 3.5 µm, it being possible for example for<br>
this to be equal to 3.0 µm. The constituent material of<br>
the cell walls will be chosen in such a way that the<br>
cells will no longer be discernible from the material<br>
with which said cells are filled. The expression "not<br>
discernible" is understood to mean that there is no<br>
visible scattering, no visible diffraction and no<br>
parasitic reflections. In particular, this may be<br>
achieved in practice by suitably adjusting the<br>
refractive index and the absorption.<br>
The array of cells may be formed directly on a rigid<br>
transparent substrate, or within a flexible transparent<br>
film that is subsequently transferred onto a rigid<br>
transparent substrate. Said rigid transparent substrate<br>
may be convex, concave or planar on that side which<br>
receives the array of cells.<br>
In one method of implementing the process, the<br>
substance having an optical property contained in at<br>
least some of the cells is in the form of a liquid or<br>
gel. Said substance may especially have at least one of<br>
the optical properties chosen from coloration,<br>
photochromism, polarization and refractive index.<br>
It may especially be in the form of a liquid or gel and<br><br>
Patent Application US 2004/0008319 proposes to modulate<br>
the refractive index parallel to the surface of a lens,<br>
such as a spectacle lens, using ink-jet heads of the<br>
kind employed in printers. These heads are controlled<br>
so as to deposit drops of solutions of polymers having<br>
different indices onto the surface of the object so as<br>
to obtain the desired variation of the index over the<br>
surface. The polymers are then solidified by<br>
irradiation or solvent removal. Control of the physical<br>
phenomena of interaction between the drops and the<br>
substrate, during both deposition and solidification,<br>
makes this method very difficult to put into practice.<br>
Furthermore, its use on a large scale is problematic<br>
since, here again, the index modulation is obtained<br>
during the manufacture of the solid object constituting<br>
the lens, and the subsequent customization assumes that<br>
a re-shaping operation is carried out on the lens.<br>
Another field of application of the invention is that<br>
of photochromic lenses. The structure of such a lens<br>
incorporates a layer whose light absorption spectrum<br>
depends on the light received. The photochromic dye of<br>
this layer is usually solid, although it is known that<br>
liquids or gels have superior properties, especially in<br>
terms of speed of reaction to the variations in<br>
luminosity.<br>
Nevertheless, lenses are known in which the<br>
photosensitive dye is a liquid or a gel, spacers being<br>
provided in the thickness of the layer in order to<br>
define the volume occupied by the dye between adjacent<br>
transparent layers, with an impermeable barrier around<br>
the periphery of this volume. Such a lens is<br>
manufactured for a specific spectacle frame. It is not<br>
possible to cut the lens in order to fit it to another<br>
frame. It is also difficult to adapt it to the<br>
ametropia of a lens to be corrected.<br><br>
It may also be beneficial to vary the light absorption<br>
parallel to the surface of the lens and/or to make this<br>
absorption dependent on the polarization of the light.<br>
Among other types of ophthalmic lenses to which the<br>
invention may apply, mention may be made of active<br>
systems in which a variation in an optical property<br>
results from an electrical stimulus. This is the case<br>
of electrochromic lenses, or else lenses having<br>
variable refractive properties (see for example US-A-<br>
5 359 444 or WO 03/077012). These techniques generally<br>
make use of liquid crystals or electrochemical systems.<br>
Among these various types of lenses, or others that are<br>
not necessarily limited to ophthalmic optics, it would<br>
be desirable to be able to provide a structure that<br>
allows one or more optical functions to be introduced<br>
in a flexible and modular manner, while still<br>
maintaining the possibility of cutting the optical<br>
element obtained, with a view to incorporating it into<br>
a specified spectacle frame or one chosen elsewhere, or<br>
into any other means of holding said optical element in<br>
place.<br>
One object of the present invention is to meet this<br>
requirement. Another object is to be able to produce<br>
the optical element on an industrial scale under<br>
appropriate conditions.<br>
The invention thus proposes a process for producing a<br>
transparent optical element, comprising the following<br>
steps:<br>
producing an optical component having at least<br>
one transparent array of cells that are juxtaposed<br>
parallel to one surface of the component, each cell<br>
being hermetically sealed and containing a substance<br>
having an optical property; and<br>
cutting the optical component along a defined<br>
contour on said surface, corresponding to a<br><br>
predetermined shape of the optical element.<br>
The cells may be filled with various substances chosen<br>
for their optical properties, for example those<br>
associated with their refractive index, their light<br>
absorptivity or polarization, their response to<br>
electrical or light stimuli, etc.<br>
The structure therefore is adapted for many<br>
applications, particularly those involving variable<br>
optical functions. It implies dividing the surface of<br>
the optical element into discrete pixels, thereby<br>
offering great flexibility in the design, but also in<br>
the use of the element.<br>
In particular, it is noteworthy that the optical<br>
component can be cut to the desired peripheral shapes,<br>
allowing it to be incorporated and fitted to various<br>
holding supports such as, for example, a spectacle<br>
frame or a helmet. The process may also include,<br>
without affecting the integrity of the structure, a<br>
step in which the optical component is drilled so as to<br>
fasten the optical element to its holding support.<br>
The layer formed by the array of cells will<br>
advantageously have a height of less than 100 µm.<br>
According to various embodiments of the invention, this<br>
height is preferably between 10 µm and 50 pm, or<br>
between 1 µm and 10 µm. In particular, it may be equal<br>
to about 5 µm.<br>
Within the context of the invention, the array of<br>
juxtaposed cells is preferably configured so that the<br>
fill factor τ, defined as the area occupied by the<br>
cells filled with the substance, per unit area of the<br>
component, is greater than 90%. In other words, the<br>
cells of the array occupy at least 90% of the area of<br>
the component, at least in a region of the component<br>
that is provided with the array of cells.<br><br>
Advantageously, the fill factor is between 90% and<br>
99.5% inclusive, and even more preferably the fill<br>
factor is between 96% and 98.5% inclusive.<br>
In order for the pixel structure not to cause<br>
undesirable diffraction effects, it is possible to make<br>
the dimensions of the cells so as to be adapted with<br>
the wavelengths of the spectrum of the light in<br>
question. The geometry of the array of cells is<br>
characterized by dimensional parameters that may in<br>
general relate to the dimensions of the cells parallel<br>
to the surface of the optical component, to their<br>
height corresponding to the height h of the walls<br>
separating them, and to the thickness d of these walls,<br>
measured parallel to the surface of the component. The<br>
dimensions of the cells parallel to the surface define<br>
the area σ of a cell. In the simple case where the<br>
cells are square with sides of length D (figure 4) ,<br>
this area is given by σ = D2, and the fill factor τ is<br>
approximately given by D2/(D+d)2. The expressions for σ<br>
and τ are easily obtained for any other spatial<br>
organization of the cells.<br>
The main source of defects in an array of cells may<br>
consist of the grid of walls. These walls are the<br>
source of a transparency defect of the optical<br>
component. In the meaning of the invention, an optical<br>
component is said to be transparent when an image<br>
observation through this optical component is perceived<br>
without significant contrast reduction, that is to say<br>
when an image formation through the optical component<br>
is obtained without impairing the image quality. Thus,<br>
the walls which separate the optical component cells<br>
interact with light, by diffracting this light. Within<br>
the context of the invention, diffraction is defined as<br>
being the light spreading phenomenon which is observed<br>
when a luminous wave is materially bound ("Optique -<br><br>
Fondement et applications" - J. P. Perez - Dunod - 7cme<br>
edition - Paris 2004 - Page 262) . More specifically,<br>
the light energy impinging a wall is concentrated in a<br>
solid angle. Because of this, a light emitting point is<br>
no longer perceived as a point through an optical<br>
component which comprises such walls. This microscopic<br>
diffraction appears macroscopically like diffusion.<br>
This macroscopic diffusion, or incoherent diffusion,<br>
appears as a milky rendering of the pixellized<br>
structure of the optical component, and so as a<br>
contrast reduction of an image observed through the<br>
structure. This contrast reduction may be considered as<br>
a transparency reduction, as defined above. Such<br>
behaviour of macroscopic diffusion cannot be accepted<br>
for an optical element obtained from a pixellized<br>
optical component according to the invention, in<br>
particular for an ophthalmic lens which has to be<br>
transparent and should not incorporate any cosmetic<br>
defect which could impair the vision of the wearer of<br>
this lens. By dimensioning the cells judiciously, it is<br>
possible to reduce the diffracted energy for a given<br>
wavelength.<br>
Thus, within the context of the invention, it will be<br>
possible to give the cells dimensions of greater than<br>
1 urn parallel to the surface of the component. In<br>
particular, these cell dimensions parallel to the<br>
surface of the component may be between 5 um and<br>
100 µm. In the application to ophthalmic optics, it may<br>
be desirable to avoid excessively large cells,<br>
something which would give the surface of the lenses a<br>
visible texture. Advantageously, the cells may have a<br>
dimension of between 10 µm and 40 µm.<br>
Parallel to the surface of the component, the cells<br>
will preferably be separated by walls with a thickness<br><br>
it may incorporate a photochromic dye, thereby making<br>
it possible for a photochromic element with a very<br>
rapid response to be conveniently produced.<br>
For the application to the manufacture of corrective<br>
lenses, it is necessary for different cells of the<br>
optical component to contain substances having a<br>
different refractive index. Typically, the refractive<br>
index will be adapted so as to vary over the surface of<br>
the component according to the estimated ametropia of<br>
an eye to be corrected.<br>
For the application to the manufacture of optical<br>
lenses having a polarization optical property, the<br>
cells of the optical component will especially contain<br>
liquid crystals that may or may not be combined with<br>
dyes .<br>
One subject of the present invention is also a process<br>
for producing an optical component as defined above,<br>
which comprises the formation, on a substrate, of a<br>
grid of walls for defining the cells parallel to said<br>
surface of the component, a collective or individual<br>
filling of the cells with the substance having an<br>
optical property in the form of a liquid or gel, and<br>
the closing of the cells on their opposite side from<br>
the substrate.<br>
The array of cells of the optical component may include<br>
several groups of cells containing different<br>
substances. Likewise, each cell may be filled with a<br>
substance having one or more optical properties as<br>
described above. It is also possible to fill several<br>
arrays of cells over the thickness of the component. In<br>
this embodiment, the arrays of cells may have identical<br>
or different properties within each layer, or the cells<br>
within each array of cells may also have different<br>
optical properties. Thus it is possible to envisage<br>
having a layer in which the array of cells contains a<br><br>
substance for obtaining a refractive index variation<br>
and another layer or array of cells contains a<br>
substance having a photochromic property.<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to an optical<br>
component used in the above process. This optical<br>
component comprises at least one transparent array of<br>
cells that are juxtaposed parallel to one surface of<br>
the component. Each cell is hermetically sealed and<br>
contains a substance having an optical property.<br>
Preferably, the cells are separated by walls with a<br>
height of less than 100 µm, advantageously less than<br>
50 µm, and may have dimensions of greater than 1 µm<br>
parallel to the surface of the component.<br>
Yet another aspect of the invention relates to a<br>
transparent optical element, especially a spectacle<br>
lens, produced by cutting such an optical component.<br>
Other features and advantages of the present invention<br>
will become apparent in the description hereinbelow of<br>

the appended drawings accompanying in which:<br>

The optical component 10 shown in Figure 1 is a blank<br>
for a spectacle lens. A spectacle lens comprises an<br>
ophthalmic lens. The term "ophthalmic lens" is<br>
understood to mean a lens that is fitted to a spectacle<br>
frame in order to protect the eye and/or correct the<br>
sight, these lenses being chosen from afocal, unifocal,<br>
bifocal, trifocal and varifocal lenses.<br>
Although ophthalmic optics is the preferred field of<br>
application of the invention, it will be understood<br>
that this invention is applicable to transparent<br>
optical elements of other types, such as for example<br>
lenses for optical instruments, filters, optical sight<br>
lenses, eye visors, optics for lightenning devices,<br>
etc. Included within the invention in ophthalmic optics<br>
are ophthalmic lenses, but also contact lenses and<br>
ocular implants.<br>
Figure 2 shows a spectacle lens 11 obtained by cutting<br>
the blank 10 around a predefined outline, shown by the<br>
broken line in Figure 1. In principle, this outline is<br>
arbitrary, provided that it falls within the extent of<br>
the blank. Mass-produced blanks can thus be used to<br>
obtain lenses that can be adapted so as to fit a large<br>
variety of spectacle frames. The edge of the cut lens<br>
may be trimmed without any problem, in a conventional<br>
manner, in order to give it a shape matched to the<br>
spectacle frame and to the method of fastening the lens<br>
to this spectacle frame and/or for aesthetic reasons.<br>
It is also possible to drill holes 14 into it, for<br>
example for receiving screws used to fasten it to the<br>
spectacle frame.<br>
The general shape of the blank 10 may conform to<br>
industry standards, for example with a circular outline<br>
of 60 mm diameter, a convex front face 12 and a concave<br>
rear face 13 (Figure 3) . The conventional cutting,<br>
trimming and drilling tools may thus be used to obtain<br>
the lens 11 from the blank 10.<br><br>
In Figures 1 and 2, the surface layers have been<br>
partially cut away so as to reveal the pixellated<br>
structure of the blank 10 and of the lens 11. This<br>
structure consists of an array of cells or<br>
microcavities 15 formed in a layer 17 of the<br>
transparent component (Figure 3). In these figures, the<br>
dimensions of this layer 17 and of the cells 15 have<br>
been exaggerated relative to those of the blank 10 and<br>
its substrate 16 so as to make it easier to examine the<br>
drawing.<br>
The lateral dimensions D of the cells 15 (parallel to<br>
the surface of the blank 10) are greater than 1 micron<br>
in order to avoid diffraction effects in the visible<br>
spectrum. In practice, these dimensions are between<br>
10 pm and 100 urn. It follows that the array of cells<br>
can be produced using well-controlled technologies in<br>
the field of microelectronics and micromechanical<br>
devices.<br>
It is therefore possible for the array of cells not to<br>
be visible on the lens 11 or on the blank 10.<br>
According to the invention, the height h of the layer<br>
17 that incorporates the array of cells 15 is<br>
preferably less than 100 pm, and more preferably<br>
between 1 pm and 10 pm inclusive. Advantageously, this<br>
height h is about 5 pm.<br>
The walls 18 that separate the cells 15 ensure that<br>
they are sealed from one another. They have a thickness<br>
d of between 0.10 µm and 5.00 µm inclusive, in<br>
particular making it possible to obtain a high fill<br>
factor of the optical component. This wall thickness<br>
may for example be equal to about 0.35 pm. A high fill<br>
factor provides a high effectiveness of the desired<br>
optical function provided by the substance contained in<br>
the cells 15. This fill factor is between 90% and 99.5%<br><br>
inclusive, advantageously between 96% and 98.5%<br>
inclusive. By judiciously combining the lateral<br>
dimension (D) of the cells with the thickness (d) and<br>
height (h) of the walls separating the cells, it is<br>
possible to obtain an optical component having a high<br>
fill factor, which is not visible depending on the<br>
optical property or properties of the substances<br>
contained in said cells.<br>
For example, with cells arranged in a square lattice<br>
(Figure 4) or hexagonal lattice (Figure 5) , walls 18<br>
with a thickness d = 2 µm and pixels of dimension<br>
D = 100 µm, only 4% of the area is absorbing (τ ≈ 96%) .<br>
For walls 18 with a thickness d = 1 µm and pixels of<br>
dimension D = 40 µm (or d = 0.5 µm and D = 20 µm) , only<br>
about 5% of the area is absorbing (τ ≈ 95%) . The lower<br>
limit may be about τ = 90%.<br>
The honeycomb or hexagonal-type lattice, shown in<br>
Figure 5, is a preferred arrangement as it optimizes<br>
the mechanical strength of the array of cells for a<br>
given aspect ratio. However, within the context of the<br>
invention all possible lattice arrangements complying<br>
with a crystal geometry are conceivable. Thus, a<br>
lattice of rectangular, triangular or octagonal<br>
geometry can be produced. Within the context of the<br>
invention, it is also possible to have a combination of<br>
various geometrical lattice shapes in order to form the<br>
array of cells, while still respecting the dimensions<br>
of the cells as defined above.<br>
The layer 17 incorporating the array of cells 15 may be<br>
covered with a number of additional layers 19, 20<br>
(Figure 3) , as is usual in ophthalmic optics. These<br>
layers provide, for example, such functions as impact<br>
resistance, scratch resistance, coloration,<br>
antireflection, antisoiling, etc. In the example shown,<br>
the layer 17 incorporating the array of cells is placed<br>
immediately on top of the transparent substrate 16, but<br><br>
it will be understood that one or more intermediate<br>
layers may be placed between them, such as layers<br>
providing impact resistance, scratch resistance or<br>
coloration functions.<br>
Moreover, it is possible for several arrays of cells to<br>
be present in the multilayer stack formed on the<br>
substrate. It is thus possible, for example, for the<br>
multilayer stack to include, in particular, a layer<br>
incorporating arrays of cells containing a substance<br>
allowing the element to be provided with photochromic<br>
functions and another layer allowing the element to be<br>
provided with refractive-index-variation functions.<br>
These layers incorporating arrays of cells may also be<br>
alternated with additional layers as described above.<br>
The various combinations are possible thanks in<br>
particular to the great flexibility of the process for<br>
producing the transparent optical element. Thus, within<br>
the context of the invention, the optical component may<br>
include an array of cells in which each cell is filled<br>
with a substance having one or more optical properties,<br>
or else in which the array of cells 15 includes several<br>
groups of cells containing different substances. The<br>
optical component may also consist of a stack<br>
comprising at least two layers incorporating an array<br>
of cells, each array of cells having identical optical<br>
properties, or each array of cells having different<br>
optical properties, or the cells within each array of<br>
cells having different optical properties.<br>
The transparent substrate 16 may be made of glass or<br>
various polymer materials commonly used in ophthalmic<br>
optics. Among the polymer materials which can be used,<br>
one can cite, for information but in a non-limitating<br>
purpose, polycarbonate materials, polyamides,<br>
polyimides, polysulfons, copolymers of<br>
polyethylenterephtalate and polycarbonate, polyolefins,<br>
in particular polynorbornens, polymers and copolymers<br><br>
of diethylen glycol di(allylcarbonate), (meth)acrylic<br>
polymers and copolymers, in particular (meth)acrylic<br>
polymers and copolymers derived from A-bisphonol,<br>
thio(meth)acrylic polymers and copolymers, urethane and<br>
thiourethane polymers and copolymers, epoxy polymers<br>
and copolymers, and episulfide polymers and copolymers.<br>
The layer 17 incorporating the array of cells is<br>
preferably located on its convex front face 12, the<br>
concave rear face 13 remaining free in order to undergo<br>
any re-shaping operation, by machining and polishing,<br>
should this be necessary. However, if the transparent<br>
optical element is a corrective lens, the ametropia<br>
correction may be achieved by spatially varying the<br>
refractive index of the substances contained in the<br>
cells 15, which makes it possible to dispense with any<br>
rework on the rear face, and consequently providing<br>
greater flexibility in the design and/or the<br>
implementation of the various layers and coatings with<br>
which the lens has to be provided. The optical<br>
component may also be located on the concave face of a<br>
lens. Of course, the optical component may also be<br>
incorporated onto a plane optical element.<br>
Figures 6 and 7 illustrate a first way in which the<br>
array of cells is produced on the substrate 16. The<br>
technique here is similar to those used for<br>
manufacturing electrophoretic display devices. Such<br>
techniques are described for example in documents<br>
WO 00/77570, WO 02/01281, US 2002/0176963, US 6 327 072<br>
or US 6 597 340. The array of cells can also be<br>
produced using fabrication processes deriving from<br>
microlectronics, well-known to those skilled in the<br>
art. By way of non-limiting illustration, mention may<br>
be made of the processes such as hot printing, hot<br>
embossing, photolithography, (hard, soft, positive or<br>
negative), microdeposition, such as microcontact<br>
printing, screen printing, or else ink-jet printing.<br><br>
In the example in question, a film of a solution of<br>
radiation-curable, for example UV-curable, monomers is<br>
deposited at first on the substrate 16. This film is<br>
exposed to ultraviolet radiation through a mask, which<br>
masks off the squares or hexagons distributed in a<br>
lattice and corresponding to the positions of the<br>
microcavities 15. By selective curing, the walls 18<br>
standing up on top of a support layer 21 are left in<br>
place. The monomer solution is then removed and the<br>
component is in the state shown in Figure 6.<br>
To obtain a similar structure, another possibility is<br>
to use a photolithography technique. This starts with<br>
the deposition on the substrate 16 of a layer of<br>
material, for example a polymer, with a thickness of<br>
the order of the intended height for the walls 18, for<br>
example 5 µm or 20 µm. Next, a film of a photoresist is<br>
deposited on this layer, this film being exposed<br>
through a mask in the form of a grid pattern. The<br>
unexposed regions are removed upon developing the<br>
photoresist, in order to leave a mask aligned with<br>
respect to the positions of the walls, through which<br>
the layer of material is subjected to anisotropic<br>
etching. This etching, which forms the microcavities<br>
15, is continued down to the desired depth, after which<br>
the mask is removed by chemical etching.<br>
Starting from the state shown in Figure 6, the<br>
microcavities 15 are filled with the substance having<br>
an optical property, in the liquid or gel state. A<br>
prior treatment of the front face of the component may<br>
optionally be applied in order to facilitate the<br>
surface wetting of the material of the walls and of the<br>
bottom of the microcavities. The solution or suspension<br>
forming the substance with an optical property may be<br>
the same for all the microcavities of the array, in<br>
which case it may be introduced simply by dipping the<br>
component into a suitable bath, using a process of the<br>
screen-printing type, a spin coating process, a process<br><br>
in which the substance is spread using a roller or a<br>
doctor blade, or else a spray process. It is also<br>
possible to inject it locally into the individual<br>
microcavities using an ink-jet head.<br>
The latter technique will typically be adopted when the<br>
substance with an optical property differs from one<br>
microcavity to another, several ink-jet heads being<br>
moved over the surface in order to fill the<br>
microcavities in succession.<br>
However, especially in the case in which the<br>
microcavities are formed by selective etching, another<br>
possibility is to hollow out at first a group of<br>
microcavities, to collectively fill them with a first<br>
substance, and then to close them off, the rest of the<br>
surface of the component remaining masked during these<br>
operations. Next, the selective etching is repeated<br>
through a resist mask covering at least the regions of<br>
microcavities that have already been filled, in<br>
addition to the wall regions, and the new microcavities<br>
are filled with a different substance and then closed<br>
off. This process may be repeated one or more times if<br>
it is desired to distribute different substances over<br>
the surface of the component.<br>
To hermetically seal an array of filled microcavities,<br>
an adhesive-coated plastic film is for example applied,<br>
this being thermally welded or hot-laminated onto the<br>
top of the walls 18. It is also possible to deposit<br>
onto the region to be closed off a curable material in<br>
solution, this material being immiscible with the<br>
substance having an optical property contained in the<br>
microcavities, and then to cure this material, for<br>
example using heat or irradiation.<br>
Once the array of microcavities 15 has been completed<br>
(Figure 7), the component may receive the additional<br>
layers or coatings 19, 20 in order to complete its<br><br>
manufacture. Components of this type are mass produced<br>
and then stored, to be taken up again later and<br>
individually cut according to the requirements of a<br>
customer.<br>
If the substance having an optical property is not<br>
intended to remain in the liquid or gel state, a<br>
solidification treatment may be applied to it, for<br>
example a heating and/or irradiation sequence, at an<br>
appropriate stage after the moment when the substance<br>
has been deposited.<br>
In a variant shown in Figure 8, the optical component<br>
consisting of an array of microcavities 25 is<br>
constructed in the form of a flexible transparent film<br>
27. Such a film 27 can be produced by techniques<br>
similar to those described above. In this case, the<br>
film 27 can be produced on a planar substrate, i.e. one<br>
that is not convex or concave.<br>
The film 27 is for example manufactured on an<br>
industrial scale, with a relatively large size, in<br>
order to make savings in the combined execution of the<br>
steps of the process, and then it is cut to the<br>
appropriate dimensions in order to be transferred onto<br>
the substrate 16 of a blank. This transfer may be<br>
carried out by adhesively bonding the flexible film, by<br>
thermoforming the film, or even by a physical adhesion<br>
effect in a vacuum. The film 27 may then receive<br>
various coatings, as in the previous case, or may be<br>
transferred onto the substrate 16 which is itself<br>
coated with one or more additional layers as described<br>
above.<br>
In one field of application of the invention, the<br>
optical property of the substance introduced into the<br>
microcavities 15 is its refractive index. The<br>
refractive index of the substance is varied over the<br>
surface of the component in order to obtain a<br><br>
corrective lens. In a first embodiment of the<br>
invention, the variation may be produced by introducing<br>
substances of different indices during the manufacture<br>
of the array of microcavities 15.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the variation<br>
may be achieved by introducing into the microcavities<br>
15 a substance whose refractive index may be<br>
subsequently adjusted by irradiation. The writing of<br>
the corrective optical function is then carried out by<br>
exposing the blank 10 or the lens 11 to light whose<br>
energy varies over the surface in order to obtain the<br>
desired index profile, so as to correct the vision of a<br>
patient. This light is typically that produced by a<br>
laser, the writing equipment being similar to that used<br>
for etching CD-ROMs or other optical memory media. The<br>
greater or lesser exposure of the photosensitive<br>
substance may result from a variation in the power of<br>
the laser and/or of the choice of the exposure time.<br>
Among the substances that can be used in this<br>
application, mention may be made, for example, of<br>
mesoporous materials and liquid crystals. The liquid<br>
crystals may be frozen by a polymerization reaction,<br>
for example one induced by irradiation. Thus, they may<br>
be frozen in a chosen state in order to introduce a<br>
predetermined optical retardation in the lightwaves<br>
that pass through them. In the case of a mesoporous<br>
material, the refractive index of the material is<br>
controlled through the variation in its porosity.<br>
Another possibility is to use photopolymers that have<br>
the well-known property of changing its refractive<br>
index over the course of the irradiation-induced curing<br>
reaction. These index changes are due to a modification<br>
of the density of the material and to a change in the<br>
chemical structure. It will be preferable to use<br>
photopolymers that undergo only a very small volume<br>
change during the polymerization reaction.<br><br>
The selective polymerization of the solution or<br>
suspension is carried out in the presence of radiation<br>
that is spatially differentiated with respect to the<br>
surface of the component, so as to obtain the desired<br>
index variation. This variation is determined<br>
beforehand according to the estimated ametropia of a<br>
patient's eye to be corrected.<br>
In another application of the invention, the substance<br>
introduced in liquid or gel form into the microcavities<br>
has a photochromic property. Among the substances used<br>
in this application, mention may be made, by way of<br>
examples, of photochromic compounds containing a<br>
central unit such as a spirooxazine, spiro-indoline-<br>
[2,3']benzoxazine, chromene, spiroxazine homoazaadaman-<br>
tane, spirofluorene-{2H)-benzopyrane or naphtho[2,1-b]-<br>
pyrane core such as those described in particular in<br>

Within the context of the invention, the substance<br>
having an optical property may also be a dye, or a<br>
pigment capable of modifying the degree of<br>
transmission.<br><br>
