FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a synergistic adhesive composition. It also relates to .novel hot melt adhesives that retain good adhesion at elevated temperatures and a process for making such hot melt adhesives.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
Hot melt adhesives (HMAs) are thermoplastic materials that are solid at room temperature.. When heated to a liquid or molten form, the HMA can be applied to a substrate. If the substrate is then contacted with another substrate and the HMA brought to ambient temperature, it solidifies to give a bond.<br>
A typical hot melt adhesive formulation comprises a base polymer, a tackifier and wax as the primary ingredient. Optional components include other polymer resins, fillers, plasticisers and anti-oxidants. The most common base polymer used in HMA has been an ethylene copolymer, in particular, an ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer. Most EVA copolymer used in HMA applications have a vinyl acetate content of 28-33%.<br>
The use of hot melt adhesives is growing because such adhesives do not use solvents and allow fast production speeds over conventional water or solvent based<br><br>
adhesives. The hot melt adhesives need to combine contrasting characteristics like fluidity (i.e. low melt viscosity) and temperature resistance and strength at elevated temperatures- Additionally, the adhesive bond so formed should not fail at elevated temperatures. This remains a major technological challenge.<br>
In addition, UV varnish coated substrates are being increasingly used in preference to laminates or aqueous varnish coatings for many applications. Conventional hot melt adhesives, however, fail to bond these substrates.<br>
Various means have been employed for improving the strength and utility of hot melt adhesives at high temperatures.<br>
Curing after application of the hot melt adhesive is one approach. An example of this is the hot melt adhesive based on a polyurethane system which cures irreversibly when exposed to the atmosphere.<br>
Styrene containing polymers have been disclosed in the prior art for high temperature applications. Elastomeric block copolymers comprising of a 'hard' segment like polystyrene and a 'soft' segment like polybutadiene, can be independently used as adhesives for high temperature resistance. However, their use is limited due to their<br><br>
nigh shear at processing temperatures and their high cost.<br>
Adhesive blends of styrene block copolymers with EVA resins are reported in the prior art. However, some of the problems associated with the use of styrene block copolymers as adhesives remain even when they are incorporated in EVA resins.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Thermoplastic, styrene containing polymers are reported as tackifiers for hot melt adhesives. Tackifiers are resins that are added to the formulation to improve the stickiness and wetting properties. Thus,<br>
US 4412030 discloses hot melt adhesives comprising styrene resins and a polymer from a group comprising copolymers of ethylene vinyl acetate, atactic polypropylene and rubbers. The styrene resin is based on styrene, alpha methyl styrene and phenol and is present in an amount between 2 5 and 7 5% with respect to the other polymer. The formulations are particularly useful as pressure sensitive adhesives.<br>
WO 9318107 discloses alpha-methyl styrene/vinyl toluene copolymers as optional tackifiers for hot melt adhesives<br><br>
comprising of EVA and a thermoplastic polyester. These are shown to be good adhesives for high temperature applications, in particular for PVC substrates. The tackifier is present in an amount from 15-40% in the adhesive.<br>
US 4039733 discloses the use of petroleum resins as tackifiers in hot melt adhesives. The copolymer comprises the spent C4 or C5 petroleum fraction from which dienic constituents have been removed, styrene and divinylbenzene, with the limitation that the styrene content in the final copolymer does not exceed 80%. The resins so produced are claimed to be tackifiers for hot melt adhesives..<br>
The applicants have now found that hot melt adhesives comprising an ethylene copolymer and a styrene polymer are easily processable and have improved strength and do not show adhesive failure at high temperatures. The said finding is surprising with regard to prior art. In addition, such HMAs show good bonding with UV varnish coated substrates.<br><br>
SUMMARY<br>
Thus, according to the present invention, there is provided a synergistic adhesive composition comprising a) an ethylene copolymer and b) a cross-hnked homo and/or copolymer of styrene or a styrene derivative, wherein the styrene content in the cross-hnked polymer is more than 80%. The compositions also contain a tackifier and wax.<br>
The hot. melt adhesives of the invention show improved rigidity and strength and better adhesion properties and can help bind a variety of substrates. They are particularly useful for UV varnish coated substrates. The hot melt adhesives of the invention can be used for high temperature applications as they show improved performance at elevated temperatures.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION:<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides a synergistic adhesive composition comprising an ethylene copolymer and a cross-hnked homo or copolymer of styrene and/or a styrene derivative, wherein the styrene content in the cross-linked polymer is more than 80%, the amount of ethylene co¬polymer is about 20 to 60%, the composition optionally comprising a tackifier, wax, filler, stabilizer and monomer.<br>
The invention also provides a method of manufacturing an adhesive composition comprising the step of mixing by melt blending an ethylene copolymer and a cross-hnked homo or copolymer of styrene and/or a styrene derivative, at a temperature in the range of 100 to 180 C, wherein the styrene content in the cross-linked polymer is more than 80%, the amount of ethylene co-polymer is about 20 to 60%, and optionally mixing a tackifier, wax, filler, stabilizer and monomer.<br>

The cross-linked polymer is preferably synthesised using any of conventional addition polymerisation methods. Examples of known methods include emulsion polymerisation, suspension polymerisation and free radical polymerisation. Especially preferred is aqueous suspension polymerisation.<br>
In aqueous suspension polymerisation, the monomer is suspended in water in the presence of a surfactant. Benzoyl peroxide is used as an initiator and the polymerisation is initiated by heating the mixture above 60°C. The reaction is continued till fine beads settle down at  the bottom of  the  reactor  and  the monomer<br><br>
conversion reaches near 100%. The polymer is separated by filtration,  steam sparged to remove the volatiles and dried. The cross-linked polymer is obtained as a white, free  flowing fine powder comprising of  substantially spherical beads.<br>

PREPARATION OF THE HOT MELT ADHESIVE<br>
Hot melt adhesives were prepared as follows.<br>
Wax (Paraflint HI™ ex Schuman Sasol) was heated to 140°C on a constant temperature bath. An antioxidant, butylated hydroxy toluene (BHT ex lonol), and an ester gum was charged into the vessel. Cross-linked polystyrene was added and dispersed thoroughly followed by the addition of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EVAFLEX 210™ ex Dupont Mitsui, amount of vinyl acetate 28%, amount of ethylene 72%). The components were mixed at 140°C till a uniform melt was obtained. The hot melt adhesive composition was poured into a mould and allowed to cool.<br>

Examples 1 to 3 are within the invention, Examples A to C are comparative.<br>
Comparative Example A contained no styrene copolymer.<br>
Comparative Example B which did not contain the EVA copolymer did not show satisfactory adhesive properties.<br>
Comparative Example C  comprising a  styrene  copolymer which is not cross-linked could not be formulated.<br><br>
The viscosity, tensile strength and hardness of the hot melt adhesives of Examples 1 to 3 and Comparative Example A were determined.<br>
Viscosity<br>
The HMA was melted and the melt temperature was maintained at 180°C. The viscosity of the HMA melt was determined on a Brookfield Viscometer Model DV2. Measurements were made at an RPM of 2 0 using spindle number 27.<br>
Tensile Strength and Percent Elongation<br>
Tensile strength and percent elongation were determined on a Instron Universal Testing Machine. The HMA was compression moulded at 90 °C into a sheet. Dumbbell shaped specimens were then cut. Measurements were made at 50 mm/minute cross-head speed.<br>
Shore Hardness<br>
Shore A hardness was determined on a Shore Hardness Measurement Tester. Measurements were made on a compression moulded sheet.<br><br>
	Property	A	1	2	3<br>
	Viscosity (cps)	1375	1962	1987	1900<br>
	Tensile strength (Kg/Sq.cm)	33	41	40	39<br>
	Percent Elongation	850	'200	180	200<br>
	Shore A Hardness	65	75	75	74<br>
Table 3 shows that incorporation of the cross-linked polymer results in an increase in rigidity and strength of the composition. The increase in viscosity does not compromise high temperature fluidity.<br>
EXAMPLES 4 TO 6<br>
In these examples, the effect of using increased amounts of cross-linked polymer was examined. The formulation details and properties are presented in Table 4, together with the corresponding details and properties of Comparative Example A.<br><br>
Ingredients	A	4	5	6<br>
Wax	14	14	'14	14<br>

Percent Elongation	850	420	200	250<br>
Shore Hardness	65	74	73	76<br><br>
The data on percent elongation shows that an increase in the amount of the cross-linked polymer results in a further increase in rigidity of the composition.<br><br>
KAAMPLE 7 AND COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE D<br>
Stiffness Modulus<br>
The change in stiffness modulus with temperature was determined for<br>
a)	a control formulation (Comparative Example D) containing Paraflint HI wax ex Schuman Sasol (14%), BHT ex Ionol (0.5%), a mixture of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers ex Dupont Mitsui (42.5%) and ester gum (42.7 5%) and<br>
b)	formulation (Example 7) containing Paraflint Hi wax ex Schuman Sasol (14%), BHT ex Ionol (0.5%), a mixture of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers ex Dupont Mitsui (42.5%), ester gum (42.75%) and CPS 1 (9.5%).<br>
Measurements were carried out on a DMA at a frequency of 2 Hz and a static stress of 8X10-3 sans.<br>
Figure 1 shows the plot of stiffness modulus vs. temperature. The HMA of Example 7 failed at a higher temperature (52°C) than the HMA of Comparative Example D (45°C) , indicating greater high temperature stability.<br><br>
Adhesive failure<br>
The adhesive failure of sealed cartons was determined for the adhesives of Example 7 and Comparative Example D.<br>
The two compositions were applied using a conventional HMA nozzle applicator at 180°C to seal filled tea cartons. The tea cartons were UV-varnish coated cartons.<br>
The tea cartons were put in an oven maintained at 7 0°C for 96 hours. Adhesive failure of boxes was determined at the end of this period.<br>
Boxes sealed using the formulation of Example 7 did not open even after 96 hours. 40% of the boxes sealed using the composition of Comparative Example D showed adhesive failure within.16 hours.<br>
Thus, the hot melt adhesives of the present invention show superior strength and rigidity and show improved high temperature stability.<br><br>
