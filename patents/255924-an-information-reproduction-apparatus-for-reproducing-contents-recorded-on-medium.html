				<td>Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to an information recording apparatus and method, an information reproduction apparatus and method, and more particularly to an---information recording apparatus and method, an information reproduction apparatus and method, which make it possible to appropriately manage security information "of AV data recorded on a recording medium.<br>
Background Art<br>
In recent years, as information recording media of<br>
the disk type, which can be removably loaded into a<br>
recording and reproduction apparatus, various optical disks of different standards such, as,, for. example, a DVD<br>
(Digital Versatile Disc)-R and a DVD-RW have been proposed. Optical disks of the type just described are expected as media of a large capacity, which can record data of several gigabytes and can record an audio signal and a video signal (AV [Audio Visual] signal) and so <br>
forth for long hours.<br>
Incidentally, the MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group)-2 system is one of .encoding systems for digitally compressing an AV signal and is applied where an AV signal is recorded onto such a DVD as described above or where a television program signal is recorded onto a hard disk by a hard disk apparatus connected to a receiver.<br>
For example, where an AV signal is recorded onto a predetermined recording medium, a video signal is encoded in accordance with the MPEG2 system and a resulting coded bit stream is recorded onto the recording medium. Meanwhile, in digital television broadcasting started in recent years, a television program is encoded in accordance with the MPEG2 system, and a resulting coded bit stream is broadcast in a format called transport stream.  It is a possible idea to record, when the television program is to be recorded, the received transport stream as it is onto a recording medium such as a hard disk without decoding or re-encoding the received television program.<br>
Where an AV signal is recorded as digital data on a recording medium in such a manner as described above, since it is possible to copy the AV signal onto another recording medium without deteriorating the same at all,<br><br>
various countermeasures have been proposed and employed in order to solve the problem regarding the copyright.<br>
For example, in order to control copying of an AV signal, a method is popularly used wherein such CC'I (Copy Control Information) as "Copy Free (copying is permitted)", "Copy Once (copying is permitted only once", "No More Copy (copying of a further generation is not permitted)" and "Copy Prohibited (copying is prohibited)" is encoded in the AV signal. More particularly, for example, a DTCP_descriptor prescribed by the DTLA (Digital Transmission Licensing Administrator) is inserted in the AV signal.<br>
In order to suppress uncontrolled copying, also a<br>
S     f—""  '        '	- • •	--—-		....<br>
.x	-<br>
method of encrypting and recording an AV signal and permitting reproduction of the AV signal only with an apparatus having a decryption key corresponding, to., the-"encryption.  For example, in the CPRM (Content Protection for Recordable Media) Specification used for the DVD format, a' predetermined field of a pack of an MPEG-2 program stream has an encrypted mode of the pack (information representative of whether or not the pack is encrypted) described therein.  For example, where the CPRM Specification is set as "00", this represents that the pack is not in an encrypted state. On the other hand,<br><br>
where the CPRM Specification is set as "11", this represents that the pack is in an encrypted state.<br>
Accordingly, in order to reproduce a recorded stream, it is necessary for a conventional reproduction apparatus to acquire such copy control information and an encryption mode as described above.  Further, in order to acquire the copy control information and the encryption mode, it is necessary for the reproduction apparatus to analyze the syntax of a bit stream included in the AV stream.<br>
More particularly, for example, in order to acquire the DTCP_descriptor as copy control information, it is necessary to analyze the syntax of a program map table of<br>
the transport stream.  Further, in order to acquire the<br>
encryption mode, it is necessary to analyze the pack<br>
header of the program stream.<br>
Incidentally, a method called DTCP is available by which the encryption mode of a stream can be acquired without analyzing the syntax of a program stream. The DTCP has been specified by the DTLA for a protocol (MPEG-TS protocol) for transferring a transport stream through the IEEE1394 digital interface (Hereinafter, IEEE1394 I/F) .<br>
In the DTCP, an EMI (Encrypted Mode Indicator) of 2<br><br>
bits is transmitted in the header of an isochronous packet used in isochronous transfer of the IEEE1394 I/F and thereby represents an encryption mode of the payload of the isochronous packet.  For example, where the EMI is "11", this represents that "Copy Prohibited" is set, but where the EMI is "01", this' represents that "No More-Copy" is set.  Further, where the EMI is "10", this represents that "Copy Once" is set, and where the EMI is "00", this represents that "Copy free" is set.<br>
It is to be noted that, where the DTCP system is used for recording, a method called "Non-cognizant recording mode" is permitted wherein only the EMI is used as copy control information to control copying without analyzing copy control information (Embedded CCI) encoded<br>
in a transport stream.<br>
/<br>
However, such a reproduction apparatus as described<br>
above has a subject to be solved in that, reference to the EMI does not allow the distinction between the representation "that the copy control information of contents is Copy free and the contents are not in an encrypted state" and the representation "that the copy control information of contents is Copy free and the contents are in an encrypted state".<br>
Accordingly, although there is a demand to encrypt<br><br>
and record contents onto a recording medium even where the copy control information of the contents is Copy free, it is impossible to encrypt contents whose copy control information is set'to Copy free and record the encrypted contents onto a recording medium due to the restriction of the representation only by the EMI' described above.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the present invention to provide copy control information and an encryption mode, which can be acquired readily from an AV stream recorded on a recording medium, and the meanings of the copy control information and the encryption mode can be represented independently of each other so that the AV stream can be reproduced readily.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention '<br>
FIG. 1 shows a structure of an AV stream on a recording medium used in a recording and reproduction system to which the present invention is applied.<br>
Referring to FIG. I, the AV stream on a recording medium used in the recording and reproduction system of the present invention has a structure of a DVR MPEG2 transport stream and has the following characteristics.<br>
(1)	The DVR MPEG2 transport stream includes an<br>
integral number of Aligned units.<br>
(2)	The size of one Aligned unit is 6144 bytes<br>
 (2048 * 3 bytes).<br>
(3)	An Aligned unit begins with the first byte of a<br>
source packet.<br>
(4)	Each source packet has a length of 192 bytes.<br>
One source packet is composed of TP_extra_header of the<br>
4-byte length and a transport packet of the 188-byte<br>
length.<br>
(5)	One Aligned unit is composed of 32 source<br>
packets.<br>
(6)	Also the last Aligned unit of the DVR MPEG2<br>
transport stream is composed of 32 source packets<br>
similarly to the other Aligned units.<br><br>
(7) When the last Aligned unit is not filled fully with transport packets of the input transport stream, the remaining byte region must be filled with source packets<br>
having a null packet (transport packet of PID = OxlFFF)..<br>
»<br>
The size of a logical block of a recording medium on which data are recorded by an information recording apparatus to which the present invention is applied is 2048 bytes.  The logical block is a minimum unit with which the recording area for data on the recording medium is delimited. When a DVR MPEG2 transport stream is recorded beginning with the first byte of the first source packet thereof into such logical blocks, since the data length of the source packets is 192 bytes, the first byte of a source packet appears at the head of a logical block for each three logical blocks (for each 2048 x 3 = 6144 bytes).  In other words, an Aligned unit is composed of 32 source packets included in 3 logical blocks.<br>
Partial erasure of data of a DVR MPEG2 transport stream can be performed in a unit of an Aligned unit. Accordingly, the size of the entire transport stream is equal to an integral number of times that of an Aligned unit. Since recording and reproduction of data of a transport stream can be performed in a unit of 3 logical blocks, the DVR MPEG2 transport stream has good<br><br>
compatibility with common file systems, and writing or reading out control of data can be performed readily.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates the syntax of a Source packet of FIG. 1.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, TP_extra_header() represents a_ header of 4 bytes (32 bits). Meanwhile, transport_packet() represents an MPEG2 transport packet of the 188-byte length prescribed by the ISO/IEC 13818-1.<br>
FIG. 3 shows a first example of the syntax of the / TP_extra_header.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, arrival__time_stamp represents a time stamp indicating the time at which a corresponding transport packet arrives at a decoder, and is represented<br>
4<br>
with 30 bits.<br>
Further, is_not_free (copy control information) of 1 bit represents a flag representative of a type of copy control of the payload of a transport packet. Matching between values set to is_not_free and meanings of them is illustrated in FIG. 4.<br>
As seen from FIG. 4, where the value of the is_not_free is set to "0", this represents that the copy control information (CCI) of the payload is Copy free.  On the other hand, where the value of the is__not_free is set to "1", this represents that the CCI of the payload is<br><br>
not Copy free.  In other words, where the is_not_free is set to "1", this represents that the CCI is No more copy, Copy once, or Copy prohibited.<br>
Generally, since the CCI of an AV stream recorded on a recording medium is Copy free or No more copy (updated as a result of recording of an AV stream of Copy once), where the is_not_free is set to "1", this represents that the CCI is No more copy.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 3, is_encrypted '(encryption<br>
identification information) represented with 1 bit is a /<br>
flag indicating whether or not the payload of the transport packet is in an encrypted state. Referring to FIG. 5, where the value of the is_encrypted is set to "0", this represents that the payload of the transport packet is not in an encrypted state. On the other hand, where the value of the is_encrypted is set to "1", this represents that the payload of the transport packet is in an encrypted state. As a method of encryption, for example, the DES (Data Encryption Standard), the Triple-DES, the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), and so forth are used.<br>
It is to be noted that, as regards the meaning of the is_not_free, where the EPN prescribed by the DTCP is encoded in a transport stream and indicates a 'xmode which<br><br>
compels encryption"/ even where the CCI of the payload is set to Copy free, the is_not_free is set to "1" as seen in the lower part in FIG. 4.  The EPN is information encoded in the DTCP descriptor and indicates whether or<br>
not encryption should be compelled when the transport<br>
stream is transferred.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates whether or not combinations of<br>
the is_not_free and the is_encrypted can be utilized.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, where the value of the is_not_free<br>
is "1", preferably-the value of the is_encrypted is not<br>
set to "0", but any other combination can be utilized.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates a second example of the syntax of the TP_extra_header.<br>
DVR_system_indicator (management information) represents a combination of copy control information of the payload of a transport packet, the EPN information and whether or not the payload of the transport packet is in an encrypted state with 2 bits. Matching between values set to the DVR_system_indicator and the meanings of them is illustrated in FIG. 8.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, where the value of the DVR_system_indicator is set to "00", the CCI of the payload of the packet is Copy free and the EPN represents the mode which does not compel encryption and besides the<br><br>
payload of the packet is not in an encrypted state on a recording medium. On the other hand, where the value of the DVR_system_indicator is set to "01", this represents that the CCI of the payload of the packet is Copy free and the EPN represents the mode which does not compel encryption and besides the payload of the packet is not in an encrypted state on a recording medium.<br>
Further, where the value of the<br>
DVR_system_indicator is set to "10", this represents that the CCI of the payload of the packet is Copy free and the EPN represents the mode which compels encryption and besides the payload of the packet is in an encrypted<br>
,tlf<br>
state on a recording medium. Where the value of the DVR_system_indicator is set to "11", this represents that the CCI of the payload of the packet is not Copy free and the payload of the packet is in an encrypted state on a recording medium.  It is to be noted that the EPN is effective only where the CCI is Copy free, and where the value of the DVR_system_indicator is set to "11", the EPN does not make sense.<br>
It is to be noted that it is otherwise possible to vary the values of the is_not_free and the is_encrypted and the value of the DVR_system_indicator in a stream as seen in FIG. 9.<br><br>
In the example of FIG. 9, source packets N to N-M are not in an encrypted state, and the values of the is_encrypted and the is_not_free of them are all set to "0", but source packets N+5 to N+7 are in an encrypted state, and the value of the is_encrypted is set to "1" and the value of the is_not_free is set to "0" or "1".<br>
On the other hand, for example, where a transport stream (not shown) inputted from the outside is to be recorded, for a packet whose CCI in the input signal is set to Copy Once, the CCI is updated to No more copy and the is_not_free is set to "1" and besides the is_encrypted is set to "1" upon recording (or the DVR_system_indicator is set to "11").<br>
On the other hand, for a packet whose CCI is set to Copy free, the is_not_free is set to "0" and the is_encrypted is set to "0" or "1" (or the DVR_system_indicator is set to one of "00", "01", and "10").<br>
Subsequently, an example of a data format of encryption of an AV stream is described.<br>
FIG. 10 illustrates an example of a data format where the unit of encryption is a source packet.<br>
The is_encrypted (or DVR_system_indicator), which represents on/off of encryption of data, is included<br><br>
within the range of a predetermined number of bytes from the top of a source packet and is not encrypted within the range. Accordingly, when encryption is performed, data of a source packet within the range of the predetermined number of bytes from the top of the source packet are not encrypted, but only those data following the range are encrypted as seen in FIG. 10.<br>
Where the unit of encryption is a source packet in this manner, when compared with an alternative case wherein the unit of encryption is an Aligned unit, on/off of encryption can be changed over in a finer period of time as hereinafter described.<br>
FIG. 11 shows an example of a data format where the<br>
unit of encryption is an Aligned unit.<br>
On/off of encryption of data is indicated by the is_encrypted (or DVR_system_indicator) of the first source packet of an Aligned unit.  Therefore, as seen in FIG. 11, those of data of source packets composing an Aligned unit of an object of encryption, which are within the range of the predetermined number of bytes from the top of the source packet, are not encrypted, but only those data following the range are encrypted.<br>
Where the unit of encryption is an Aligned unit, since the unit of processing is greater than that where<br><br>
the unit of encryption is a source packet as described above, the burden of encryption processing and decryption processing can be reduced.<br>
Alternatively, in the cases illustrated in FIGS. 10 and 11, the value within the range within which data are not encrypted may be used as a parameter (seed) for encryption calculation of data following the range. Consequently, if the value within the range within which encryption is not performed is tampered, then those encrypted data following the range cannot be decrypted. Therefore, tampering of the encrypted data can be prevented.<br>
FIG. 12 shows an example of a configuration of an information recording apparatus 1 to which the present<br>
invention is applied.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 12, the information recording<br>
apparatus 1 shown can record such input sources as, for example, video/audio inputs, a tuner input of a television program signal obtained from a digital television broadcasting wave, and a transport stream supplied through an IEEE1394 I/F 27.<br>
First, a configuration of the information recording apparatus 1 for recording an AV stream obtained by encoding a video input inputted to a terminal 11 and an<br><br>
audio input inputted to another terminal 12.<br>
A copy control information detection section 15 detects a CGMS (Copy Generation Management System) signal (CGMS-A or CGMS-D) or a Water mark signal to acquire copy control information of the video signal supplied from the terminal 11 and outputs CCI (denoted by CCI_i in FIG. 12) currently set to the video signal to a controller 19.<br>
Further, the copy control information detection section 15 outputs the supplied video signal to an MPEG2 encoder 16.<br>
The MPEG2 encoder 16 encodes the video signal supplied from the copy control information detection section 15 and the audio signal supplied from the terminal 12 into an MPEG video stream and an MPEG audio stream, respectively.  The MPEG streams obtained by the encoding by the MPEG2 encoder 16 are supplied to a multiplexing section 17.<br>
The multiplexing section 17 multiplexes the MPEG streams supplied from the MPEG2 encoder 16 and Embedded CCI (denoted by CCI_o in FIG. 12) supplied from the controller 19 to produce a transport stream and outputs the transport stream to a source packetization section 18. The Embedded CCI has a value updated when necessary from the value of the CCI (denoted by CCI_i) set currently to<br><br>
the video signal.<br>
The controller 19 determines, the value of the Embedded CCI to be included in the transport stream based on the CCI_i supplied from the copy control information detection section 15 and outputs the value of the Embedded CCI to the multiplexing section 17. A process of the controller 19 when it determines the value of the Embedded CCI is hereinafter described in detail.  It is to be noted that the Embedded CCI determined by the controller 19 is described, for example, in the DTCP_descriptor so that it is included into the transport stream.<br>
The source packetization section 18 produces, based on the transport stream supplied from the multiplexing section 17 and information supplied from the controller 19, a packet train composed of source packets in whose header the values of the is_not_free and the is_encrypted<br>
If<br><br>
(or the value of the DVR_system_indicator) determined by the controller 19 are described, and outputs the packet 'train to an encryption section 20.<br>
The controller 19 determines the values of the is_not_free and the is_encrypted (or the value of the DVR_system_indicator) to be described in the header of each source packet based on the CCI_i supplied from the<br><br>
copy control information detection section 15, and outputs the values (or the value) to the source packetization section 18. A process of the controller 19 when it determines the values of the is_not_free and the is_encrypted (or the value of the DVR_system_indicator) is hereinafter described.  It is to be noted that information designating, an input source to be recorded and so forth are supplied to the controller 19 through a terminal 25.<br>
The encryption section 20 encrypts the source packet train supplied from the source packetization section 18 in accordance with the setting of the is_encrypted (or the DVR_system_indicator) described in the packet header of each of the source packets of the source packet train.  Data of the source packet train obtained by the encryption by the encryption section 20 are outputted to an ECC (Error-Correcting Code) encoding<br>
section 21. /<br>
The data of the source packet train obtained by the encryption by the encryption section 20 are subject to predetermined processes in the ECC encoding section 21 and a modulation section 22,-and resulting data are outputted to a drive 23.<br>
The drive 23 records the data supplied from the<br>
modulation section 22 in the format for a DVR MPEG2 transport stream onto a recording medium 24.<br>
Subsequently, a configuration of the information recording apparatus I for recording a transport stream obtained from an RF signal of a digital television broadcasting wave received by an antenna 13 is described.<br>
A digital television tuner 26 acquires a partial transport stream including a predetermined program (for example, television program data) from an RF signal supplied from the antenna 13 and outputs the partial transport stream to a terminal 28A side (Cognizant recording side; Cog side in FIG. 12) of a switch 28.<br>
The partial transport stream supplied to the terminal 28A is outputted to a copy control information detection section 29.<br>
The copy control information detection section 29 detects copy control information and EPN included in the partial transport stream supplied thereto and outputs the CCI (denoted by CCI_i in FIG. 12) currently set and the EPN to the controller 19.  The copy control information and the EPN are described in the partial transport stream, for example, in accordance with a method prescribed for the format of digital television broadcasting.<br>
The copy control information detection section 29<br><br>
outputs the partial transport stream supplied from the digital television tuner 26 to the multiplexing section 17.<br>
In addition to the partial' transport stream supplied from the copy control information detection section 29, the values of the Embedded CCI and the EPN determined by the controller 19 are inputted to the multiplexing section 17.  The multiplexing section 17 multiplexes the information supplied from the controller 19 into the partial transport 'stream to produce a transport stream.<br>
In particular, the controller 19 determines the values of the Embedded CCI and the EPN to be multiplexed into the partial transport stream based on the CCI_i and the EPN inputted from the copy control information detection section 29 and outputs the determined values to the multiplexing section 17.  Details of the process of the controller 19 when it determines the Embedded CCI and the EPN are hereinafter described.<br>
Thereafter, the source packetization section 18 converts the transport stream into a source packet train and the encryption section 20 performs an encryption process for the source packet train based on the value of the is_encrypted (or the value of DVR_system_indicator)<br><br>
of each packet header in a similar manner as described hereinabove. The source packet train obtained by the encryption is subject to an ECC process, a modulation process, and so forth and is then recorded onto the recording medium 24.<br>
Now, a configuration of the information recording apparatus 1 for recording a transport stream inputted from a set top box (STB) 14 connected to the information recording apparatus 1 through an IEEE1394 serial bus in the "Cognizant recording mode" is described.<br>
The IEEE1394 interface 27 restores a transport stream from a stream of isochronous packets supplied from the STB (Set Top Box) 14 and outputs the resulting transport stream to the copy control information detection section 29 through the terminal 28A side of the switch 28.<br>
The copy control information detection section 29 detects CCI_i and EPN from the transport stream in a similar manner as' in recording of a transport stream obtained from a digital television broadcasting wave<br>
described hereinabove, and outputs the detected CCI_i and<br>
/ EPN to the controller 19.  Further, the copy control<br>
information detection section 29 outputs the transport stream to the multiplexing section 17.  The values of the<br><br>
is_not_free and the is_encrypted (or the value of the DVR_system_indicator) determined based on the CCI i and<br>
X<br>
the EPN are described in the header of each source packet of the outputted transport stream, and the transport stream is encrypted suitably and then recorded onto the recording medium 24.<br>
Now, a configuration of the information recording apparatus 1 for recording a transport stream inputted from the STB 14 connected through the IEEE1394 serial bus in the "Non-cognizant recording mode" is described.<br>
The IEEE1394 I/F 27 restores a transport stream from a stream of isochronous packets supplied from the STB 14 and outputs the resulting transport stream to a terminal 28B (Non-cognizant recording side; Non-cog side in FIG. 12) of the switch 28.  The transport stream outputted from the terminal 28B is outputted to the source packetization section 18 through the multiplexing section 17.  In other words, the transport stream inputted to the multiplexing section 17 is outputted to the source packetization section 18 without being processed at all, that is, passes through the source packetization section 18.<br><br>
Further, the IEEE1394 I/F 27 acquires an EMI described in the header of each isochronous packet<br><br>
inputted thereto and outputs the EMI to the controller 19.<br>
The controller 19 determines the values of the is_not_free and the is_encrypted (or the value of the DVR_system_indicator) to be described in the header of each source packet based on the EMI supplied from the IEEE1394 I/F 27 and outputs the thus determined values to the source packetization section 18.  Details of the process of the controller 19 for determining the values of the is_not_free and the is_encrypted (or the value of the DVR_system_indicator) to be described in the header of each source packet are hereinafter described.<br>
The transport stream supplied to the source packetization section.18 is converted into a source packet train wherein each packet has a header in which the values of the is_not_free and the is_encrypted (or the value of the DVR_system_indicator) supplied from the controller 19 are described, and then undergoes encryption and so forth suitably, whereafter it is recorded onto the recording medium 24.<br>
Now, a process of the information recording apparatus 1 when it records video and audio signals inputted to the terminals 11 and 12 of FIG. 12 is described with reference to a flow chart of FIG. 13.<br>
At step Si, the copy control information detection<br><br>
section 15 detects, for example, a CGMS signal (CGMS-A or CGMS-D) or a Watermark signal of the input video signal to acquire copy control information (CCI_i) of the video signal supplied from the terminal 11.  The CCI_i detected by the copy control information detection section 15 is . outputted to the controller 19.<br>
At step 52r the controller 19 discriminates based on the CCI_i acquired at step SI whether or not the inputted video signal is a recordable signal.  In particular, the information recording apparatus 1 has such a matching table as shown in FIG. 14 or 15 set therein in advance, and the controller 19 discriminates based on the setting of the matching table.<br>
FIG. 14 shows an example of a matching table where a transport stream is recorded onto the recording medium 24. making use of the flags of is_not__free and is_encrypted.  In the example of FIG. 14, it is indicated that the video signal cannot be recorded if the CCI_i is set to "01" or "11".<br>
FIG. 15 shows an example of a matching table where a transport stream is recorded onto the recording medium 24 making use of the DVR_system_indicator.  In the example of FIG. 15, it is indicated that the video signal cannot be recorded where the CCI i is set to "01" or "11".<br><br>
In FIGS. 14 and 15, where the CCI_i and the CCI_o are "00", they represent "Copy free"; where they are "01" they represent "No more copy"; where they are "10", they represent "Copy once"; and where they are "11", they<br>
represent "Copy Prohibited".<br><br>
It is to be noted that the matching tables shown in FIGS. 14 and 15 are utilized also for determination of the values of the Embedded CCI (CCI__o) and the EPN as hereinafter described.<br>
For example, if the flags of is__not_free and is_encrypted are utilized to record a transport stream onto the recording medium 24, if the controller 19 discriminates at step S2 that the acquired copy control information is "01" or "11", then it determines that the inputted video signal cannot be recorded, and ends its processing.<br>
On the other hand, if the controller 19 discriminates that the value set in the copy control information is any other value than "01" and "11", then the processing advances to step S3. It is to be noted that the video signal supplied to the copy control information detection section 15 is outputted to the MPEG2 encoder 16.<br>
At step S3, the MPEG2 encoder 16 encodes the video<br><br>
signal supplied from the copy control information detection section 15 and the audio signal supplied from the terminal 12 into an MPEG video stream and an MPEG audio stream, respectively.  The MPEG streams obtained by the encoding by the MPEG2 encoder 16 are supplied to the<br>
multiplexing section 17.<br><br>
At step S4, the controller 19 refers to the matching table shown in FIG. 14 or 15 based on the CCI_i supplied from the copy control information detection section 15 to determine the value of the CCI_o to be multiplexed into the transport stream.<br>
In the example of FIG. 14 (that is, where the flags of is_not_free and is_encrypted are utilized to record a transport stream), the controller 19 determines the CCI_o as "00" where the CCI_i is "00", but determines the CCI_o as "01" where the CCI_i is "10". In other words, an input stream set to Copy free (CCI_i = 00) is thereafter recorded.as a Copy free (CCI_o = 00) stream similarly, but an input stream set to Copy once (CCI_i = 10) is thereafter recorded as a No more copy (CCI_o = 01) stream.<br>
On the other hand, in the example of FIG. 15 (that is, where the DVR_system_indicator is utilized to record a transport stream), the controller 19 determines the CCI o as "00" if the CCI i is "00", but determines the<br><br>
CCI_o as "01" if the CCI_i is "10".<br>
The CCI_o determined in such a manner as described above by the controller 19 is outputted to the multiplexing section 17.<br>
Then at step S5, the controller 19 refers to the matching table shown in FIG. 14 based on the CCI_i supplied from the copy control information detection section 15 to determine the values of the is_not_free and the is_encrypted or refers to the matching table shown in FIG. 15 to determine the value of the DVR_system_indicator.<br>
More particularly, the controller 19 utilizes the matching table shown in FIG. 14 to determine "0" as the value of the is_not_free and determine "0" or "1" as the • value of the is_encrypted if the CCI_i is "00".  On the other hand, if the CCI_i is "10", then the controller 19 determines "1" both as the value of the is_not_free and as the value of the is_encrypted.<br>
On the other hand, the controller 19 utilizes the matching table shown in FIG. 15 to determine "00" or "01" as the value of the DVR_system_indicator if the CCI__i is "00", but determines."11" as the value of the DVR_system_indicator if the CCI_i is "10".<br>
The values of the is_not_free and the is_encrypted<br><br>
or the value of the DVR_system_indicator determined by the controller 19 is outputted to the source packetization1 section 18.<br>
At step S6, a source packetization process of converting the transport stream into data of a source packet train is performed.<br>
In particular, the multiplexing section 17 describes the CCI_o supplied from the controller 19 into the MPEG stream supplied from the MPEG2 encoder 16, for example, making use of a DTCP_descriptor and outputs the acquired transport stream to the source packetization section 18.<br>
The source packetization section 18 produces a packet train composed of source packets having headers in which the values of the is__not_free and the is_encrypted determined by the controller 19 are described based on the transport stream supplied from the multiplexing section 17 and the information supplied from the controller 19, and outputs the packet train to the encryption section 20. On the other hand, the source packetization section 18 produces a packet train composed of source packets having headers in which the values of the DVR_system_indicator determined by the controller 19 are described, and outputs the packet train to the<br><br>
encryption section 20.<br>
At step S7, the encryption section 20 encrypts the source packet train supplied from the source packetization section 18 based on the setting of the is_encrypted or the DVR_system_indicator described in the packet headers. It is to be noted that, where it is necessary to control whether or not encryption should be performed for each Aligned unit, the encryption section 20 performs its encryption process based on information and so forth described in the packet header of each packet.  In particular, where whether or not encryption should be performed for each Aligned unit is not controlled (where data of all Aligned units should be encrypted), the controller 19 issues an instruction of this directly to the encryption section 20.<br>
If the is_encrypted of a packet is set to "1" or if the DVR_system_indicator is set to "10", then the encryption section 20 encrypts the payload of the packet (refer to FIGS. 5 and 8).<br>
To each of the source packets for which the encryption process has been performed by the encryption section 20, an error check bit is added by the ECC encoding section 21.  Then, resulting source packets are modulated by the modulation section 22 and then recorded<br><br>
in an encryption unit (in a unit of a source packet (FIG. 10) or in a unit of an Aligned unit (FIG. 11)) onto the recording medium 24.<br>
.The controller 19 discriminates at step S9 whether or not the recording process should be ended (whether or not all of the video signal and so forth supplied have been recorded).  If it is discriminated that the recording process should not be ended, then the processing returns to step SI so that the processes described above are executed repetitively. On the other hand, if it is discriminated that the recording process should be ended, then the copy control information detection section 15 ends the process.<br>
Now, a process of the information recording apparatus 1 when it records a transport .stream acquired from the digital television tuner 26 or through the IEEE1394 I/F 27 is described with reference to a flow chart of FIG. 16.<br>
At step S21, it is discriminated which one of a process of recording a transport stream (partial transport stream) extracted by the digital television tuner 26 and a process of recording a transport stream acquired through the IEEE1394 I/F 27 should be performed. If it is discriminated at step S21 that a process<br><br>
of recording a partial transport stream extracted by the digital television tuner 26 should be performed, then the copy control information detection section 29 acquires CCI_i and EPN from the partial transport stream at step 324.  The partial transport stream has been extracted by the digital television tuner 26 and supplied through the switch 28. As described above, the CCI_i and the EPN are included in the partial transport stream in accordance with the method prescribed in the format of digital television broadcasting.<br>
The CCI_i and the EPN acquired by the copy control information detection section 29 are outputted to the controller 19.<br>
At step S25, the controller 19 discriminates based on the copy control information acquired at step S24 whether or not the inputted partial transport stream is a recordable stream.  In particular, the information recording apparatus 1 has such matching tables as shown in FIGS. 17 and 18 set therein in advance, and the controller 19 makes the discrimination based on the settings of the matching tables.<br>
FIG. 17 shows an example of a matching table for a case wherein the flags of is_not_free and is_encrypted are utilized to record a transport stream onto the<br><br>
recording medium 24 while FiG. 18 shows an example of a matching table for another case wherein the DVR_system_indicator is utilized to record a transport stream onto the recording medium 24.<br>
For example, in the example of FIG. 17, if the CCI_i is set to "01" or "11", then this indicates that the acquired partial transport stream cannot be recorded. Accordingly, if the controller 19 discriminates at<br>
step S25 that, for example, the CCI_i is "01" or "11",<br>
/ then it ends the succeeding processing.  On the other hand,<br>
if the controller 19 discriminates that any other value than them is placed in the CCI_i, then the processing advances to step S26.  It is to be noted that the matching table, shown in FIG. 17 is utilized also for determination of the values of the CCI_o, EPN, is_not_free, and is_encrypted as hereinafter described.<br>
Further, also in the example of FIG. 18, where the CCI_i is set to "01" or "11", this.indicates that the partial transport stream cannot be recorded.<br>
At step S26, the controller 19 refers to the matching table shown in FIG. 17 or 18 based on the CCI_i and the EPN supplied from the copy control information detection section 29 to determine the value of the CCI__o to be included into the transport stream.<br><br>
Accordingly, when the CCI_i is "00", the CCI_o is determined as "00", but when the CCI_i is "10", the CC1 o is determined as "01" similarly as in the case wherein a signal inputted to the terminal 11 is recorded.  It is to be noted that a value equal to the EPN of the inputted partial transport stream is recorded as the EPN.<br>
Then at step' S27, where the flags of is_not_free and is_encrypted are utilized to record a transport stream onto the recording medium 24, the controller 19 refers to the matching table shown in FIG. 17 based on the CCI_i and the EPN supplied from the copy control information detection section 29 to determine the values of the is_not_free and the is_encrypted.<br>
More particularly, the controller 19 utilizes the matching table shown in FIG. 17 to determine "0" as the value of the is__not_free and determine "0" or "1" as the value of the is_encrypted where the CCI_i is "00" and the EPN is a "mode which does not compel encryption" ("mode A" in FIG. 17).<br>
On the other hand, where the CCI_i is "00" and the EPN is a "mode which compels encryption" ("mode B" in FIG. 17), the controller 19 determines "1" as both of the value of the is not_free and the value of the is_encrypted.<br><br>
Further, where the CCI_i is "10", the controller 19 determines "1" as both of the value of the is_not_free and the value of the is_encrypted.<br>
On the other hand, where the DVR_system_indicator is utilized to record a transport stream onto the recording medium 24, the controller 19 refers to the matching .table shown in FIG. 18 based on the CCI_i and the EPN supplied from the copy control information detection section 29 to determine the value of the DVR_system_indicator.<br>
More particularly, the controller 19 utilizes the matching table shown in FIG. 18 to determine "00" or "01" as the value of the DVR_system_indicator where the CCI_i is ",00" and the EPN is a vmode which does not compel encryption" ("mode A" in FIG. 18) .  On the other hand, where the CCI_i is "00" and the EPN is a "mode which compels encryption" ("mode B" in FIG. 18), the controller 19 determines "10" as the value of the DVR_system_indicator.<br>
Further, where the CCI_i is "10", the controller 19 determines "11" as the value of the DVR_system_indicator.<br>
The values of the CCI_o and the EPN determined in such a manner as described above by the controller 19 are outputted to the multiplexing section 17, and the values<br><br>
of the is_not_free and the is_encrypted or the value of the DVR_system_indicator is outputted to the source packetization section 18.<br>
Processes, at step S28 and the succeeding steps are similar to those at step S5 and the succeeding steps of FIG. 13.  In particular., since a transport stream produced by the multiplexing section 17 based on the CCI__o and the EPN and the stream supplied from the copy control information detection section 29 is outputted to the source packetization section 18, the source packetization section 18 produces a packet train composed of source packets each having a header in which the values of the is_not_free and the is_encrypted or the value of the DVR_system_indicator determined by the controller is described, and outputs the packet train to the encryption section 20.<br>
Each of the source packets outputted from the encryption section 20 is encrypted, at step S29, based on the setting of the is_encrypted or the DVR_system_indicator described in the packet header thereof.  Then, the source packets after the encryption are recorded in an encryption unit onto the recording medium 24 at step S30. As described hereinabove, where it is necessary to control whether or not encryption should<br><br>
be performed for each Aligned unit, an encryption process based on the information described in the packet header and so forth is performed by the encryption section 20. On the other hand, where whether or not encryption should be encrypted for each Aligned unit should not be controlled (where data of all Aligned units should be encrypted), the controller 19 issues an instruction of this directly to the encryption section 20.<br>
The processes described above are executed repetitively until after it is discriminated at step S31 that the entire transport stream supplied is recorded.<br>
On the other hand, if it is discriminated at step S21 that a process of recording a transport stream acquired through the IEEE1394 I/F 27 should be performed, then the processing advances to step S22.  Then, the IEEE.1394 I/F 27 discriminates whether or not the acquired transport stream should be recorded in the "Cognizant recording mode".<br>
If it is discriminated at step S22 that the • transport stream should be recorded in the "Cognizant recording mode", then the IEEE1394 I/F 27 changes over the switch 28 to the terminal 28A side to output the acquired transport stream to the copy control information detection section 29.  Thereafter, the'processes at step<br><br>
S24 and the succeeding steps are executed for the transport stream acquired by the IEEE1394 I/F 27.<br>
Also the process executed for a transport stream acquired by the IEEE1394 I/F 27 is basically similar to the process described hereinabove, which is executed for a transport stream extracted by the digital television tuner 26.<br>
In particular, CCI_i and EPN are acquired from the transport stream restored from a stream of isochronous packets supplied from the STB 14, and the values of the is_not_free and the is_encrypted or the value of the DVR__system_indicator is determined based on the matching table shown in FIG. 17 or 18.  Further, encryption and so forth are performed suitably for the transport stream based on the thus determined values or value, and resulting data are recorded onto the recording medium 24.<br>
On the other hand, if it is discriminated at step S22 that the transport stream should be recorded in the "Non-Cognizant recording mode", then the processing advances to step S23, at which the IEEE1394 I/F 27 acquires EMI described in the header of an inputted isochronous packet.<br>
The controller 19 discriminates, at step S25, based on the EMI acquired at step S23, whether or not the<br><br>
inputted transport stream is a recordable stream. In particular, such matching tables as shown in FIGS. 19 and 20 are set in advance in the information recording apparatus 1, and the controller 19 makes the discrimination based on the settings of the matching tables.<br>
FIG. 19 shows an example of a matching table where the flags of is__not_free and is_encrypted are utilized to record the transport stream onto the recording medium 24 while FIG. 20 shows another example of a matching table where the DVR_system_indicator is utilized to record the transport stream onto the recording medium 24.<br>
In the examples of FIGS. 19 and 20, it is indicated that the transport stream cannot be recorded where the EMI is set to "01" or "11".<br>
Accordingly, if it is discriminated at step S22 that the EMI is, for example, "01" or "11", then the controller 19 ends the succeeding processing, but if it<br>
r&gt;f<br>
is discriminated that the EMI has any other value set thereto, then the processing advances to step S26.<br>
In FIGS. 19 and 20, where the EMI is "00", this indicates that the data is "Copy free" data and is in the non-encryption mode, but where the EMI is "01", this indicates that the data is "No more copy" data and is in<br><br>
the encryption mode.  On the other hand, where the EMI is "10", this indicates that the data.is "Copy once" data and is in the encryption mode, but where the EMI is "11", this indicates that the data is "Copy Prohibited" data and is in the encryption mode.<br>
The matching tables shown in FIGS. 19 and 20 are utilized also for determination of the values of the is_not_free and the is_encrypted as well as the DVR_system_indicator as hereinafter described.<br>
It is to be noted that, if it is discriminated at step S25 that the inputted transport stream is a recordable stream, then the transport stream is outputted to the source packetization section 18 through the multiplexing section 17.  In other words,, when a transport stream is to be recorded in the "Non-Cognizant recording mode", the multiplexing section 17 does not perform any process for the transport stream (the process at step S26 is not performed).<br>
At step S27, where the flags of is_not_free and is_encrypted are utilized to record the transport stream onto the recording medium 24, the controller 19 refers to the matching table shown in FIG. 19 based on the EMI supplied from the IEEE1394 I/F 27 to determine the values of the is not free and the is encrypted.<br><br>
More particularly, the controller 19 utilizes the matching table shown in FIG. 19 to determine "0" as the value of the is_not_free and determine "0" or "1" as the value of the is_encrypted where the EMI is "00".<br>
On the other hand, where the EMI is "10", the controller 19 determines "1" as both of the value of the is_not_free and the value of the is_encrypted.<br>
Further, where the DVR_system_indicator is utilized 'to record the transport stream onto the recording medium 24, the controller 19 refers to the matching table shown in FIG. 20 based on the EMI supplied from the IEEE1394 I/F 27 to determine the value of the DVR_system_indicator.<br>
More particularly, the controller 19 utilizes the matching table shown in FIG. 20 to determine "00" or "01" as the value of the DVR_system_indicator where the EMI is "00" but determine "11" as the value of the DVR_system_indicator where the EMI is "10".<br>
Thereafter, similarly as in the processes described hereinabove, the values of the is_not_free and the is_encrypted or the value of DVR_system_indicator determined in such a manner as described above is described into the header of the source packet, and encryption and so forth are performed suitably based on such values.  Then, resulting data are recorded onto the<br><br>
recording medium 24.<br>
It is to be noted that, where the encryption unit is set to an Aligned unit and one Aligned unit includes a source packet whose is_not_free is set to "0" and a source packet whose is_not_free is set to "1" (or one Aligned unit includes a source packet whose DVR_system_indicator is set to "11" and a source packet whose DVR_system_indicator is set to any other value than "11"), at step S6 of FIG. 13 or at step S28 of FIG. 16, the is_encrypted of the top source packet of the Aligned unit can be set to "1" (the DVR_system_indicator of the top source packet of the Aligned unit can be set to "11").<br>
Where such setting is not used, in order to prevent mixed presence of a source packet whose is_not_free is set to "0" and a source packet whose is_not_free is set to "1" (to prevent mixed presence of a source packet whose DVR_system_indicator is set to "11" and a source packet whose DVR_system_indicator is set to any other value than "11"), the controller 19 performs'such control as to make the changing point of the value of the is_not_free coincide with a boundary of an Aligned unit (to make the changing point of the value of the DVR_system_indicator coincide with a boundary of an Aligned unit).<br><br>
FIG. 21 shows an example of a configuration of an information reproduction apparatus 41 for reproducing an AV stream having been recorded onto a predetermined recording medium by the information recording apparatus 1 described above.<br>
Referring to FIG. 21, the information reproduction apparatus 41 shown reproduces a recording medium 51 on which an AV stream is recorded. A drive 52 reads out the AV stream recorded on the recording medium 51 and outputs the AV stream to a demodulation section 53.<br>
The AV stream read out by the drive 51 is subject to predetermined processes by the demodulation section 53 and an ECC decoding section 54 and is then outputted to a decryption section 55.<br>
The decryption section 55 performs a decryption process in accordance with a method corresponding to the encryption method based on the value of the is_encrypted (or the DVR_system_indicator) of each source packet.  When the value of the is_encrypted indicating on/off of encryption is "1" (or when the DVR_system_-indicator has a value any other than "00"), the decryption section 55 decrypts the source packet in an encrypted state.  However, when the value of the is_encrypted is "0" (or when the DVR_system__indicator is "00") , the decryption section 55<br><br>
outputs the source packet supplied thereto as it is to a source depacketization section 56.<br>
Further, the decryption section 55 outputs the values of the is_encrypted and the is_not_free (or the value of the DVR_system_indicator) set in the header of the source packet to a controller 57.<br>
The source depacketization section 56 outputs the acquired transport packet at a predetermined timing based on the value of the Arrival_time_stamp of the source packet to an IEEE1394 I/F 58.<br>
Also information from the controller 57 is inputted to the IEEE1394 I/F 58.  In particular, the controller 57 determines EMI based on the is_not_free (or the DVR_system__indicator) supplied from the decryption section 55 and outputs the EMI to the IEEE1394 I/F 58. Details of the process of the controller 57 for determining EMI based on the is_not_free (or DVR_system_indicator) supplied from the decryption section 55 are hereinafter described.<br>
The IEEE1394 I/F 58 converts a transport packet into an isochronous packet. At this time, the IEEE1394 I/F 58 sets the value of the EMI supplied from the controller 57 into the EMI field of the isochronous packet header.  The isochronous packet produced by the<br><br>
IEEE1394 I/F 58 is supplied to an STB 59 through an IEEE1394 serial bus.<br>
Now, a process of the information reproduction • apparatus 41 when it reproduces an AV stream recorded on the recording medium 51 is described with reference to a flow chart of FIG. 22.<br>
At step S41, the drive 52 reads out an AV stream recorded on the recording medium 51.  The AV stream read out by the drive 52 is subject to predetermined processes by the demodulation section 53 and the ECC decoding section 54 and is then outputted to the decryption section 55.<br>
At step 342, the decryption section 55 acquires the value of the is_encrypted (or DVR_system_indicator) of a source packet and performs a decryption process for the source packet in accordance with a method corresponding to the encryption system based on the acquired value.  In particular, when the value of the is__encrypted indicating on/off of encryption is "1" (or when the DVR_system_indicator is any other value than "00"), the decryption section 55 decrypts the encrypted source packet.  However, when the value of the is_encrypted is "0" (or when the DVR_system_indicator is "00"), the decryption section 55 outputs the source packet supplied<br><br>
thereto as it is to the source depacketization section 56.<br>
Further, at step S43, the decryption section 55 acquires the values of the is_encrypted and the is_not_free of the1 source packet.  The values of the is_j=ncrypted and the is_not_free acquired by the decryption section 55 are outputted to the controller 57. It is to. be noted that, otherwise where the DVR_system_indicator is described in the header of the source packet, the value is acquired by the decryption section 55 and outputted to the controller 57.<br>
At step S44, the controller 57 refers to a matching table shown in FIG. 23 based on the value of the is_not_free supplied from the decryption section 55 to determine EMI.<br>
In the example of FIG. 23, where the is_not_free is set to "0", "00" is selected as the EMI, but where the is_not_free is set to "1", "01" is selected as the EMI.<br>
It is to be noted that, where, in FIG. 23, the EMI is "00", this indicates that the data is "Copy free" data and is in the non-encryption mode, but where the EMI is "01", this indicates that the data is "No more copy" data and is in the encryption mode.  Further, where the EMI is "10", this indicates that the data is "Copy once" data and is in the encryption mode, but where the EMI is "11",<br><br>
this indicates that the data is "Copy Prohibited" data and is in the encryption mode.<br>
However, at step S44, if the DVR_system_indicator is received from the decryption section 55, then the controller 57 refers to a matching table shown in FIG. 24 based on the received value to determine the value of the EMI.<br>
In the example of FIG. 24, where the DVR_system_indicator is set to "00" or "01", "00" is selected as the EMI, but where the DVR_system_indicator is set to "10", "10" is selected as the EMI.  Further, where the DVR_system_indicator is set to "11", "01" is selected as the EMI.<br>
The EMI selected in such a manner as described above by the controller 19 is outputted to the IEEE1394 I/F 58.<br>
At step 345, the source depacketization section 56 performs source depacketization and outputs a thus acquired transport packet at a predetermined timing based on the value of the Arrival_time_stamp of the source packet to the IEEE1394 I/F 58.<br>
At step S46, the IEEE1394 I/F 58 sets the value of the EMI supplied from the controller 57 to the EMI filed of the header and produces an isochronous packet from the<br><br>
transport packet supplied from the source depacketization section 56.<br>
Then at step S47, the IEEE1394 I/F 58 outputs the acquired isochronous packet to the STB 59 through the IEEE1394 serial bus by isochronous transfer.  Thereafter, an AV stream is reproduced by the set top box 59.<br>
At step S48, it is discriminated whether or not the reproduction process should be ended (whether or not all of the AV stream have been reproduced) .  Then, until after it is discriminated at step S48 that the reproduction process should be ended, the processing returns to step S42 so that the processes described above are executed repetitively.<br>
Reproduction of an AV stream recorded on a recording medium is controlled in such a manner as described above.<br>
It is to be noted that, while the foregoing description relates to recording and reproduction of an MPEG2 transport stream as a multiplexed stream, the multiplexed stream to be recorded or reproduced is not limited to this, but the present invention can be applied also to recording or reproduction of a DSS transport stream or an MPEG2 program stream. Industrial Applicability<br><br>
As described above, according to the present • invention, since the copy control information and the meanings of the encryption mode are represented independently of each other, that "the copy control information of the contents is Copy free and the contents are not in an encrypted state" and that "the copy control information of the contents is Copy free and the contents are^in an encrypted state" can be represented in a distinguishable manner from each other.<br>
In the information reproduction apparatus for reproducing the AV stream recorded onto the recording medium, the copy control information and the encryption mode of the AV stream can be acquired readily from the stream so that the AV stream can be reproduced readily.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	An information reproduction apparatus (41) for reproducing contents recorded on a<br>
recording medium (51), comprising:<br>
acquisition means for acquiring copy control information added to the contents based on whether or not recording of the contents onto the recording medium was permitted and two bits of control information representing: (a) whether or not copying of the contents is permitted, and (b) whether or not the contents are in an encrypted state irrespective of whether or not the copying of the contents is permitted, wherein the two bits of control information are stored in the headers of source packets containing said contents; and decrypting means (55) for decrypting the contents, where the control information acquired by said acquisition means represents that the contents are in an encrypted state, wherein said apparatus further comprising outputting means (58) for adding relationship information representative of a matching relationship between the copy control information and an encryption mode to the contents based on the copy control information to produce a predetermined packet and outputting the predetermined packet and reproduction means for reproducing the packet outputted from said outputting means based on the relationship information.<br>
