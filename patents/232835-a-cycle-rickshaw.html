				<td>The present invention relates to a cycle rickshaw and improvements in it.<br>
A Cycle-rickshaw is basically a three-wheeler vehicle which is man-driven by means of pedaling such as that in a bicycle and serves in transportation of passengers and/or goods from one place to another. It is eco-friendly since it is not a fuel-powered vehicle and thereby is free of pollution hazards and is very useful and effective means of short distance transportation on metalled and non-metalled roads.<br>
Conventional Cycle-rickshaws known for several decades and also presently available basically comprise of a supporting framed structure, which provides a seating arrangement at the rear for the passengers (two) side by side and a driver seat in front. At the front there is provided a wheel which is operatatively connected through pedal (driver sprocket) and chain means to two rear wheels. In particular, in such conventional cycle-rickshaws known to the art the driver sprocket (attached to the pedal), drive only one of the rear wheels and the other rear wheel is maintained as an idler. The reason for such an arrangement of connecting the driver sprocket to only one of the rear wheels is that, if the driver - sprocket is rigidly connected to both the rear wheels, therebeing no provision for allowing differential angular speed of the said wheels produced on turns and bends, the wheels would be subject to skidding with consequent damage to the tyres and rotating linkages.<br>
It is however experienced that, such conventional cycle-rickshaws suffer from inherent drawbacks and disadvantages mainly due to high centre of gravity of the system, only front-wheel brakes, stiff suspension, unsafe constructional features, inconvenient<br><br>
and uncomfortable seating arrangement for the passengers and the Strain and stress that the driver has to encounter while driving such vehicle. One of the inherent drawbacks of such conventional cycle rickshaw inspite of being provided with the drive system with the driver-sprocket operatively connected to one said rear wheel with the other rear wheel being maintained free-rolling is that, the tractive effort expended on the drive by the person pedaling is not fully utilized and consequently during the movement of the vehicle it experiences a pull on one side due to eccentric tractive force in the forward direction. Besides, there is undue wear and tear of the driving wheel tyres and importantly, one side drag of the handle bar cause undue pain, strain, and fatigue for the driver. The overall energy consumption in driving conventional cycle-rickshaws is found to be quite high, about 34 KJ/min. for two-passenger load on a level road, which is very enervating and health hazardous for the driver.<br>
The above problems and disadvantages in conventional cycle-rickshaws being existent for a long time since the introduction of such vehicles, numerous attempts have been made to solve them and improve stability of the vehicle, provide convenience and comfort to the passengers as well as reduce the stress and strain experienced by drivers,<br>
Indian Patent No. 152591 discloses and describes a cycle-rickshaw wherein four wheels consisting of a front wheel and a rear wheel and two additional wheels incorporate in between the said front wheel and rear wheels to provide stability to the vehicle. However, such a construction results in a four-wheel cycle-rickshaw and does not deal with improvement in stability of three-wheeled conventional cycle-rickshaws.<br><br>
It is also known to provide powered cycle-rickshaws as per Indian Patent Nos. 139723 and 147466 to relieve the driver of the stress and strains of a man-driven cycle-rickshaw. Indian patent No. 147466 provides for an improved drive mechanism for cycle-rickshaw comprising a rickshaw chassis/frame connected to an axle near the rear wheels and a bottom bracket characterised in that two curved beams in plan of rectangular box section which are joined together at one end near the bottom bracket and the other two ends rest on the axle near the rear wheels. However, use of such additional power source apart from resulting in unwanted increase in the weight of the cycle-rickshaw also does away with the eco-friendliness of a man-driven (non-powered) conventional cycle-rickshaw.<br>
Indian patent No. 146764 is directed to disclosure of a carriage having a construction whereby the carriage driver is able to exert his entire physical energy effectively with sufficient ease to pull more load at less physical strain,<br>
Indian patent No. 132345 provides for an improved cycle-rickshaw wherein the two rear wheels are rotatably mounted on free wheels on its frame-work. A shaft spaced from these free wheels is also rotatably mounted on the said frame-work, and the said shaft being provided with three sprockets, the outer two of said sprockets being coupled respectively by chain drives to the said free-wheels and the middle sprocket being coupled by another chain-drive to the driver-sprocket carrying the pedals such that while each of the two rear wheels are also enabled to rotate at different angular speeds than that of the other, a seat rests on springs fixed on the frame-work, said seat however movably engageable with the said frame-work to enable said seat to be movably supported on the springs to dampen the forces caused by<br><br>
jerks and jolts produced when the said rickshaw is in motion. However the suspension used in such rickshaw is rather complicated, bulky and heavy adding to the weight of the vehicle. The said patented disclosure also has limitations in lowering the seat height due to provision of spring members under the seat to counter jerky motions which again lead to a higher centre of gravity of the vehicle and consequently affecting the safety and stability of the vehicle. Further the said patent is silent about the breaking mechanism used for the pair of the rear wheels and thus the safety aspects have not been dealt with therein.<br>
Thus the above clearly reveals that there is a constant need for the improvement of conventional cycle-rickshaws for its beneficial use. However a composite solution by way of a construction of a cycle-rickshaw which on one hand provide comfort for the passengers and require less energy and strain out of the driver and on the other hand provide safe means of transportation by cycle-rickshaw is yet to be provided. Importantly, all such known art cycle-rickshaw constructions suffer from one or more of the following disadvantages :-<br>
a)	the centre of gravity of the vehicle being quite high<br>
resulting in instability while negotiating sharp turns and<br>
also during braking at higher speeds on slopes which is<br>
hazardous both for the drivers and passengers.<br>
b)	driving mechanism does not fully satisfy the motion required<br>
of two rear wheels.<br>
c)	provision for braking only of the front wheel which lead to<br>
a longer braking distance and time, thus often causing<br>
accidents when brakes are applied during operation of the<br>
vehicle at high speed.<br><br>
d)	the footboard under the passenger-seats is quite high<br>
causing problem to passengers especially women, children,<br>
old and infirm while embarking and dismounting from the<br>
vehicle. Moreover the footboards are usually sloping in the<br>
forward direction which provide inconvenient leg-support to<br>
the passengers and lead to a tendency of bending forward<br>
while seated on the rickshaw even on slightest braking.<br>
e)	the overall mechanical efficiency is low since the driving<br>
mechanism is tedious for the driver and the components used<br>
in the cycle-rickshaw are mostly of substandard quality and<br>
locally fabricated by workmen having no formal training and<br>
expertise.<br>
f)	the leg-space for the passengers is not sufficient to<br>
provide for a comfortable seating posture for the passengers<br>
during ride of the vehicle.<br>
It is thus the primary objective of the present invention to provide for a cycle-rickshaw which would provide comfortable and safe ride for the passenger and at the same time be safe, convenient, easy and less enervating for the driver to drive the vehicle.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a cycle rickshaw having means for converting the passenger-carrier cycle rickshaw to a make-shift load-carrier by a simple device.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide for an improved cycle-rickshaw utilising more of conventional and readily available standard components known for use in bicycle trade and operation.<br><br>
Another object of the invention is directed to providing a cycle-rickshaw of conventional bicycle components which can be easily assembled to fabricate the cycle-rickshaw and also can be easily disassembled as and when found necessary for servicing and maintenance.<br>
Another object of the invention is directed to providing for a cycle-rickshaw construction which would provide for safe, convenient and comfortable seating posture for the passenger as well as a comfortable and convenient mounting and dismounting to and from respectively of the vehicle by the passenger.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide for a cycle-rickshaw construction which would impart better stability to the vehicle by maintaining lower centre of gravity even when loaded with passengers and/or loads and improve upon the suspension system to absorb road-shocks.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide for an improved driving mechanism compatible with a specially developed modular framed structure for cycle-rickshaw.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide for a braking system in cycle-rickshaw which would provide for equitable distribution of the braking force among the three wheels of a cycle-rickshaw and thereby simplify the design of front-wheel fork-support and frame-work of the chassis,<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide for an improved cycle-rickshaw having the features defined in the preceding paragraphs and which would be simple and cost-effective to obtain.<br><br>

Reference is first invited to figure 1, which shows the assembled cycle-rickshaw of the present invention. As illustrated in the said figure 1, the modular framed structure of the cycle-rickshaw basically comprises of a front portion (Fl) obtained of conventional bicycle components as clearly represented in figures 2A &amp; 2B, a rear portion constituted of a pair of rear wheels an framed structure (F2) also obtained of conventional bicycle<br><br>
components as illustrated in figure - 3 and tubular bridging member (Yl) connecting to said front portion (Fl) and said rear portion (F2).<br>
Referring to figures 2A &amp; 2B, the front portion (Fl) of the cycle-rickshaw comprises of the front wheel (Wl) supported by fork means (fl) and steerable handle means (H), a tubular framed structure (al bl cl dl), a driver seat (S), a BB axle (B2) and pedal means (PI &amp; P2). It is important to note that all of the components constituting the said front portion of the cycle-rickshaw of the invention are those available in any conventional bicycle.<br>
Referring to figure 3, the rear portion of the cycle-rickshaw of the invention comprises of a pair of rear wheels with corresponding pair of framed structure (F2) and each said frame structure supporting one said rear wheel (W2), and having a tubular framed structure (a2 b2 c2 d2 e2), a dead axle (BB1) and a free-wheel sprocket (Cl), said pair of rear wheel and accompanying framed structure (F2) spaced apart from one another to accommodate the passenger seat (PS) therebetween and facing rearwardly.<br>
The above discussed front portion and the rear portion of the cycle-rickshaw are connected by means of a substantially Y-shaped tubular bridging member (Yl) and universal clamps J1/J2 as shown in figures 6A &amp; 6B.<br>
The connection of the front portion to said rear portion of the vehicle by means of said bridging member is obtained by way of special clamping mechanism which is now discussed hereunder :<br><br>
As is seen in figure 3 and also clearly illustrated in figure 4A the rear end portion of each arm (AR) of the tubular Y-shaped bridging member (Yl) is flattened and made to traverse thereunder the BB axle-hub (Bl) and the thus flattened end portion extending beyond said BB axle-hub (Bl) is cut to define two flattened portions which are wrapped around the tubular member (b2c2) of a rear tubular frame portion of the cycle-rickshaw and clamped with respect thereto by means of clamps J1/J2 illustrated more clearly in Figs. 6A/6B. Each of the tubular arms (AR) of the Y-Shaped bridging member just ahead of said BB axle-hub(Bl) towards the front of the vehicle are each clamped with respect to the tubular frame member (C2^2^ °^ ^e respective rear tubular framed structure of the cycle-rickshaw. Such a means of clamping the bridging member to the rear portion of the vehicle provide for the due rigidity and strength at said connecting portion at the rear of the vehicle.<br>
Reference is now invited to figures 1, 2A, 2B &amp; also 4B to illustrate the claimping means of the Y-shaped bridging member(Yl) to the front portion of the cycle-rickshaw. As represented in said figure 4B, the tubular arms (AR) of the said Y-shaped bridging member (Yl) at their ends facing the BB axle (B2) fit into two projections (PR) of said BB axle (B2). Thereafter, the thus enveloped projections (PR) are clamped with clamping means (J1/J2) illustrated clearly in figures 6A/6B to thereby secure the connection of the bridging member (Yl) to said front portion(Fl) of the cycle-rickshaw.<br>
The modular framed structure at the rear of the cycle-rickshaw of the invention is illustrated in greater detail with reference to figure 5. As illustrated in said figure-5 each rear wheel is<br><br>
mounted on dead axle BB1 of a conventional bicycle, each said dead axle supported by a corresponding tubular framed structure denoted by references (a2b2c2d2e2)The two parallely placed tubular frames (a2b2c2d2e2) are also conventional bicycle components and offer low stiffness structural supports for the weight of the passenger's body with or without additional load on the footboard and thus obviate the need for any coil or elliptical leaf spring known to exist in conventional cycle-rickshaws. Further connecting of said pair of frames (a2b2c2d2e2) by tubular cross members (E1F1F2E2) and G1G2 with universal clamps (Fig, 6A) provide for lateral rigidity of the unibody cycle-rickshaw frame as a whole. Also the additional supporting frames (X1M1) (Ref. Fig.l), provide further stability and rigidity to the rear framed structure of the cycle-rickshaw of the invention. Also advantageously, the said framed structure (E1F1F2E2) provide for removably supporting and securing the passenger seat (PS) with respect to the vehicle rear frame structure. Importantly, such modular framed structure provide for positioning the centre of gravity of the vehicle at a desired lower level and tending towards the front axle. Matching semi-cylindrical steel tubular pieces are provided on the tubular frames (a2c2) and (c2d2) which are clamped with respect to the said passenger seat and/or the supporting structure (E^-^) and (E2F2) to provide for an improved supporting means for the passenger seat and the load thereon with respect to the vehicle framed structure. Advantageously, the backrest for the passenger seat (PS) can be obtained of a hinged connection with respect to the seat portion such that in case of use of the cycle-rickshaw for carrying loads other than passenger, the cushioned front portion of the back-rest (CF) can be laid down over the seat<br><br>
portion such that loads can be carried on the reverse side of the back-rest which is made of hard-wood. The modular framed structure of the cycle-rickshaw of the invention also provides for advantageous positioning of a canopy cover (CC) (Shown in closed position) over the driver's body in addition to the passengers as is clearly seen from Fig.l,<br>
Importantly, in order to minimize the weight of the vehicle, the seat portion and the footrest thereof are obtained of a basic framed structure made of light timber (as shown in Fig. 8), which may be covered with G.I. sheet and the like for protecting the timber and also for providing shining aesthetic outlook to the cycle-rickshaw. The above wooden frame work with or without said G.I. sheetcoverage is provided with cushion means (CM) to add comfort to the passenger seating thereon. The clamp securing of the passenger seat to the vehicle framed structure at the rear provide for easy dismantling of the seat as and when any servicing and/or maintainance job is necessary.<br>
Reference is now invited in Fig, 7 which shows the driving mechanism used in the cycle-rickshaw of the invention which is made compatible with the modular framed structure of the cycle-rickshaw. As is illustrated in Fig. 7, the two rear wheels (W2) are maintained rotatable by mounting on freewheels (ff-jj. Shaft (SH) also rotatably mounted on frictionless bearings at the axle-hub (B1) and is supported with respect to the said BB-axle housing of the tubular rear portion of the vehicle. The said shaft (SH) is provided with sprockets (SP2, SP3 and SP4), the outer two of said sprockets (SP2 &amp; SP4) being coupled respectively by means of chain drives (C2 &amp; C4) to the respective freewheels (ff1). The sprockets SP3 at the middle of the shaft<br><br>
(SH) is coupled by a further chain drive (C3) to the sprocket (SP1) of pedal means (P1, P2). The number of teeths on sprockets SP1 and SP3 can be selected and the sprocket positioned to achieve a desired velocity ratio of the driver's choice. Advantageously additional sprocket such as SP3' can be provided with varying number of teeths to enable selection of desired sprocket for operative connection to SP1 depending upon the road conditions (up hill/down hill) and/or the load conditions of the vehicle. For reduction of velocity ratio the pedal effort is also reduced. Hence SP3 can be kept inoperative near SP3, when SP3 is being used and for changing the gear ratio when required SP3' may be connected to the chain drive (C3) and SP3 kept idle. In the arrangement of the drive system as above upon pedalling, the sprocket (SP^ operatively connected to the pedals (Plf P2) drive sprocket (SP3/SP3' as the case may be) on the shaft (SH) thereby rotating the sprockets (SP2 &amp; SP4) and consequential driving of the freewheels ff1 ,<br>
Thus the drive system of the cycle-rickshaw while travelling on a straight path provide for same angular speed of rotation of both the rearwheels (W2) and while taking a turn or negotiating a bend the outer of the rear wheels can rotate at higher angular speed than the inner due to the incorporation of the freewheel (ff1) on both the said rear wheels. Thus arrangement improves the maneuverability and safety of the cycle-rickshaw. It is important to mention here that such driving arrangement is compatible with the tubular framed structure of the cycle-rickshaw described above which also cater to maintaining strength and stability to the vehicle even during climbing uphill with loads/passengers.<br>
Reference is now invited to Fig. 9 which illustrates the braking system used to equitably distribute the braking force on<br><br>
application 'of the brakes on the threewheels of the cyclerickshaw of the invention. As used in conventional bicycle the right brake is applied for the front wheel while the left brake is provided for the rear wheels. The same mechanism and linkages of a conventional bicycle is used in the cycle-rickshaw of the invention. However, for even distribution of the braking force on the three wheels of the cycle-rickshaw of the invention as shown in Fig. 9, the brake wire (BW) from the left handle-bar extends thereunder the Y-shaped bridging member (as shown in Fig.l) and is connected to a torsion rod drive device by which the braking force is distributed between the two rear wheels equally. Thus the braking mechanism provide for safe and effective jerk-free braking of the cycle-rickshaw of the invention.<br>
The cycle-rickshaw of the present invention is thus directed to provide for a cycle-rickshaw which would on one hand be safe and comfortable for the passengers to ride on and on the&gt; other hand would be simple and easy for the driver to the vehicle. Also considering that the components used in the cycle-rickshaw of the invention are esily available conventional components, its manufacture and/or assembling and/or dissembling for servicing and maintenance would be easy and convenient. Further the cycle-rickshaw of the invention apart from serving the abovesaid will be cost effective to obtain.<br><br><br><br>
