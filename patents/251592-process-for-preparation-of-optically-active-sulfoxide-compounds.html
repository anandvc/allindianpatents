3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION:<br>
The following specification describes the invention .<br><br><br>
Technical field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel processes for preparing optically active sulphoxide compounds. More particularly, the invention relates to processes for optically active proton pump Inhibitors (PPIs) or their optically active precursor (=intermediate) compounds (Formula I) that can be converted into pharmaceutically useful PPIs.<br>
Background And Prior Art:<br>
Sulphoxide compounds, particularly, Pyridinylmethylsulphinyl benzimidazoles compounds of the following structure are known to have H+/K+-ATPase-inhibitory action and therefore have considerable importance in the therapy of diseases associated with an increased secretion of gastric acid or used as anti-ulcerative agent. Many sulphoxide compounds of closely related structure are known, for example, from EP0005129, EP166287, EP174726 and EP268956.  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
wherein Rl, R2 and R3 are the same or different and selected from hydrogen, halogen, nitro, alkyl, alkylthio, alkoxy optionally substituted by fluorine, alkoxyalkoxy, dialkylamino, piperidino, morpholino, halogen, phenylalkyl and phenylalkoxy; R4 and<br><br><br>
R5 are the same or different and selected from hydrogen, alkyl and aralkyl; R6' is hydrogen, halogen, trifluoromethyl, alkyl or alkoxy; R6 -R9 are the same or different and selected from hydrogen, alkyl, alkoxy, halogen, halo-alkoxy, alkylcarbonyl, alkoxycarbonyl, oxazolyl, trifluoroalkyl, or adjacent groups R6 -R9 form ring structures which may be further substituted; RIO is hydrogen or forms an alkylene chain together with R3 and Rl 1 and R12 are the same or different and selected from hydrogen, halogen and alkyl; R13 is hydrogen or a protective group such as benzyl, trityl etc.<br>
In the above definitions alkyl groups, alkoxy residues may be branched or straight C1 -C9 -chains or comprise cyclic alkyl groups, for example cycloalkylalkyl.<br>
Examples of pharmaceutically active PPIs falls with in the compounds of Formula I, are 5-methoxy-2- [ (4-methoxy-3, 5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl) methylsulphinyl]-lH-benzimidazole (also named as omeprazole), (S)-5-methoxy-2- [ (4-methoxy-3, 5-dimethyl-2- pyridinyl) methylsulphinyl]-lH-benzimidazole (common name: esomeprazole), 5-difluoromethoxy-2- [ (3, 4-dim- ethoxy-2-pyridinyl) methylsulphinyl]-lH-benzimidazole (Common name: pantoprazole), 2- [3-methyl-4- (2, 2,2-trifluoroethoxy)-2-pyridinyl) methylsulphinyl]-lH-benzimidazole (Common name: lansoprazole), 2- { [4- (3- methoxypropoxy)-3-methylpyridin-2-yl] methylsulphinyl}-lH-benzimidazole (rabeprazole) and 5-methoxy-2- ( (4-methoxy-3, 5-dimethyl-2-pyridylmethyl) sulphinyl)-l H-imidazo (4,5-b) pyridine (tenatoprazole).<br>
The above-mentioned sulphoxide compounds are also referred to as proton pump inhibitors or abbreviated PPI owing to their mechanism of action. These compounds are chiral because of generation of chirality at sulphur atom when a prochiral sulphide is oxidixed to sulphoxide, and therefore exists in two enantiomeric forms, namely the dextrorotatory isomer and levorotatory isomer, which is also symbolized as R-isomer and the S-isomer. The process conventionally used for preparing the sulphoxide is the oxidation of the corresponding prochiral sulphides leading to a racemic mixture comprising about the same proportions of the two enantiomers, i. e. the (+) -and (-) -form or the (R) -and (S) -form of the sulphoxide compound.<br><br><br>
Optical isomers of above sulphoxide compounds are known to have better efficacy or advantages in administration or helpful in reducing the dose regimen and therefore, of interest to a pharmaceutical chemist.<br>
The preparation of optically active sulphoxide compounds are known from W091/12221, which describes a process for separating enantiomers using a cellulase enzyme. One of the active compounds illustrated in this process includes omeprazole.<br>
A chemical process by classical racemate resolution was reported in W092/08716 that describes the separation of pyridin-2-ylmethylsulphinyl-l H-benzimidazole compounds into their optical isomers by formation of chiral diasteromeric derivatives. Compounds so prepared includes (+)-and (-)-5-difiuoromethoxy-2- [(3, 4-dimethoxy-2-pyridinyl) methylsulphinyl]-l H-benzimi- dazole [(+) -and (-)-pantoprazole] and (R) or (S)-omeprazole. A similar resolution process is disclosed in W094/27988 for the separation of racemic omeprazole into the enantiomers, using chiral auxiliaries and isolation of various pharmaceutical salts.<br>
These methods suffer from various drawbacks, as they lead to loss of more than 50% of the unwanted isomer in the resolution process itself. The increased number of processing steps further escalates the cost and also the acid labile nature of tartget sulfoxides reduces the applicability for large scale application and therefore, such processes are not suitable for industrial production of pure optically active sulphoxide compounds.<br>
Interestingly, US 5948789 patent describes a process for the enantioselective synthesis of PPI using chiral titanium complexes, which is referred to as an improvement over the well known asymmetric oxidation processes of prochiral sulphides developed by Kagan et al.. Kagan et al (please refer to J. Am. Chem. Soc. 106 (1984), 8188, or its improved version in Euro. J. Biochem. 166 (1987) 453) described a process for asymmetric oxidation of prochiral sulphides in presence of a chiral titanium complex (made of titanium derivative and a chiral ligand such as diethyl tartarate) in an organic solvent.<br><br><br>
But according to the description of US5948789, even the Kagan's improved version of asymmetric oxidation of sulphides comprising a system of Ti(0-iPr)4 /diethyl tartrate/water (1:2:1) in methylene chloride was reported to give very poor enantioselectivity/ no selectivity for PPI's like Esomeprazole .<br>
Therefore, in US5948789 patent, the enantioselectivity of oxidation of prochiral sulfides, especially for PPIs, was improved by conducting the oxidation using the same reactants/reagents in presence of a base in an organic solvent..<br>
Similar processes are disclosed in WO/1999/025711, US20050187256 &amp; WO2005054228 for sulphoxide compounds or its intermediate including esomeprazole. All these reactions were performed in an organic solvent. The enantioselective sulphoxidation for preparing esomperazole on a large scale using a chiral titanium complex is also described in Tetrahedron, Asymmetry, (2000), 11,3819-3825. The enantioselective sulphoxidation of prochiral sulphides is extended to other chiral metal ligands like chiral Zirconium or vanadium complexes in J. Org. Chem., (1999), 64 (4), 1327 &amp; WO/2004/052882.<br>
A further process is disclosed in WO2006040685, by conducting the oxidation of sulphides in the presence of a chiral titanium complex &amp; base in the absence of solvent. According to the description of '685 patent the oxidation reaction is conducted in anhydrous conditions. However the yields reported are very low, for example only about 30-32% with an enantioselectivity of about 92%, clearly indicating that carrying out the reaction in the absence of solvent does not improve the overall efficiency of the process for PPIs.<br>
In the applicants hands, except for the asymmetric oxidation in presence of a base and in an organic solvent, the chiral purity obtained in the above described processes is very poor or not very better for industrial practice. Therefore, there still exists a need for improved processes for oxidation of prochiral sulphide compounds, especially the PPIs, owing to the importance of said compounds. The present inventors have found alternative processes for the enantioselctive oxidation of prochiral sulfide which provides still better<br><br><br>
optical yields and purity, which process also reduces the sulfone impurity to a minimal level.<br>
Summary of the invention.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides new processes for preparation of optically active sulfoxide compounds of Formula I,  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
wherein Rl, R2 and R3 are the same or different and selected from hydrogen, halogen, nitro, alkyl, alkylthio, alkoxy optionally substituted by fluorine, alkoxyalkoxy, dialkylamino, piperidino, morpholino, halogen, phenylalkyl and phenylalkoxy; R4 and R5 are the same or different and selected from hydrogen, alkyl and aralkyl; R6' is hydrogen, halogen, trifluoromethyl, alkyl or alkoxy; R6 -R9 are the same or different and selected from hydrogen, alkyl, alkoxy, halogen, halo-alkoxy, alkylcarbonyl, alkoxycarbonyl, oxazolyl, trifluoroalkyl, or adjacent groups R6 -R9 form ring structures which may be further substituted; RIO is hydrogen or forms an alkylene chain together with R3 and Rl 1 and R12 are the same or different and selected from hydrogen, halogen and alkyl; and R13 is hydrogen or a protective substituent like benzyl, trityl etc.; in the above definitions alkyl groups, alkoxy residues may be branched or straight C1 -C9 -<br><br>
chains or comprise cyclic alkyl groups, for example cycloalkylalkyl, comprising asymmetric oxidation of prochiral sulphide compounds of Formula II,<br><br><br><br><br>
wherein the groups are as defined above, in the presence of a chiral transition metal complex in water and in presence of a base. The characteristic of the invention lies in the enantioselective oxidation that is carried out in the presence of aqueous solvent and in the absence of organic solvent.<br>
In a second aspect of the present invention, a process for preparation of optically active sulphoxides of Formula I is provided which comprises asymmetric oxidation of prochiral sulphides of Formula II in presence of a chiral transition metal complex in water and in presence of a base and catalyst. The catalyst is selected from sulphoxide compounds, for example dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO).<br>
Optically active Sulfoxide compounds of Formula I, wherein R2 is a leaving group such as halo, nitro results in chiral sulphoxide compounds which are useful as penultimate intermediates for PPIs. On substitution with appropriate alkoxide according to any known procedure the above proton pump inhibitors of pharmaceutical interest can be obtained.<br>
The transition metal may be selected from the group comprising titanium, zirconium, hafnium and vanadium. The most preferred transition metal is titanium. The transition metal complex may be prepared from a transition metal derivative and a chiral ligand.<br>
Thus, the chiral transition metal complex is prepared by the reaction of transition metal derivative and the complexing chiral ligand, either separately or in the presence of the<br><br><br>
prochiral sulphide substrate of Formula II at suitable conditions. A suitable reagents and solvent, if required may be used to achieve the complexation of transition metal with the ligand.<br>
Suitable oxidizing agents are any oxidizing agents customarily used for the synthesis of substituted sulphenyl compounds of Formula I, where particular mention may be made of hydroperoxides, such as, for example, alkyl hydro peroxide, arylhydroperoxides and aryl alkyl hydro peroxide. Especially preferred are cumene hydroperoxide and tritylhydroperoxide.<br>

Embodiments of the invention are not mutually exclusive, but may be implemented in various combinations. The described embodiments of the invention and the disclosed examples are given for the purpose of illustration rather than limitation of the invention as set forth the appended claims.<br>
The expressions "pro-chiral sulphide(s)" are used for the sulphides of the corresponding sulphoxides suitable for being prepared by the novel process according to the present<br><br><br>
invention. If the corresponding sulphide already contains a stereogenic centre in the molecule, such a sulphide is not a pro-chiral compound, but a chiral compound.

The term "omeprazole", as used herein unless specified otherwise, refers to a racemic<br>
mixture       of      5-methoxy-2-[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridyl)methylsulfinyl]-lH-<br>
benzimidazole   and   6-methoxy-2-[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridyl)methylsulfinyl]-<br>
lH-benzimidazole in the solid state.<br>

The term "S-omeprazole" or "esomeprazole", as used herein unless specified otherwise,<br>
refers to the S stereoisomer of omeprazole and including its known salts..<br>
The term "R-omeprazole", as used herein unless specified otherwise, refers to the R<br>
stereoisomer of omeprazole.<br>

The term "alkyl" refers to a straight or branched alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon<br>
atoms. Exemplary alkyl groups include but are not limited to methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-<br>
propyl, n-butyl, and iso-butyl.<br>
The term "aryl" refers to an aromatic, optionally fused, carbocycles having from 6 to 20<br>
carbon atoms. Examples of C6-12-aryl include but are not limited to phenyl and napthyl.<br>
The term "alkylaryl" or 'aralkyl' refers to an alkyl substituted with one or more aromatic<br>
residues, optionally with substituents. Examples of alkylaryl include but are not limited to<br>
biphenylmethyl or triphenyl methyl.<br>
The term 'Enantioselective' as used herein, refers to the preferential formation of one of<br>
the enantiomer to obtain an optically pure compound or optically enriched enantiomeric<br>
mixtures in which the ratio of the enantiomers differs.<br><br><br>
The term 'enantiomeric excess' as used herein, refers generally to the concentration of one stereoisomer that exceeds the concentration of another stereoisomer. Typically, the term is used to characterize the optical purity of an optically active compound that exists in the bulk as two or more stereoisomers. In the present context, the term also refers to the excess of either S- or R-omeprazole over the other that are present in a given enantiomeric enriched mixture of the present invention.<br>
This invention is directed to processes for preparation of sulphoxide compounds that, by virtue of the processes of this invention, are substantially optically pure or optically enriched mixtures of enantiomers. Accordingly, the present invention provides processes for   the   preparation    of   optically    active    substituted    pyridinylmethyl    sulfinyl-benzimidazoles of the compound of Formula           I,<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Wherein the groups Rl to R13 are as defined previously.<br>
The process comprises enantioselective oxidation of a substituted pyridinylmethyl prochiral sulfide derivative of compound of Formula II,<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Wherein the groups Rl to R13 are as defined above, in the presence of a base in aqueous solvent. The prochiral sulphides may be employed as its stable alkali metal salts during the oxidation. It should be understood that compounds wherein R2 is a leaving group such as halo, nitro are useful as penultimate intermediates for PPIs listed above. On substitution with appropriate alkoxide according to any known procedure, the above proton pump inhibitors of pharmaceutical interest can be obtained. The products obtained may thereafter be converted to pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof by conventional processes either for facilitating purification/isolation or pharmaceutical application. Substituted optically active sulphoxides prepared by the enantioselective catalytic oxidation process of the present invention may be obtained either in optically active enantiomer or enantiomerically enriched forms, preferably as an optically enriched substituted pyridinylmethyl-sulfinyl-benzimidazole according to the formula I.<br>
Preferably, the process of the present invention provides an enantioselective process for the preparation of optically active or enantiomerically enriched sulfoxides , especially omeprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole and lansoprazole, in free forms or their alkali and/or alkaline earth metal salts , which are proton pump inhibitors useful in the treatment of ulcers.<br>
Thus the present invention provides processes for the preparation of alkali and/or alkaline earth metal salts of an optically active enantiomer or an enantiomerically enriched form of substituted pyridinylmethyl-sulfinyl-benzimidazole, which are of pharmaceutical interest or useful as intermediates for formation/purification of said optically active compounds of Formula I.<br><br><br>
The process of the invention is characterized by the enantioselective oxidation of the corresponding prochiral sulphide of Formula II being carried out in the presence of aqueous solvent and a base using the chiral transition metal complex. The oxidation is carried out advantageously in the absence of any organic solvent, but in the presence of water.<br>
In a second aspect of the present invention, a process for preparation of optically active sulphoxides of Formula I is provided which comprises asymmetric oxidation of prochiral sulphides of Formula II in presence of a chiral transition metal complex in water and in presence of a base and catalyst. The catalyst is selected from sulphoxide compounds, for example dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO).<br>
The transition metal may be selected from the group comprising titanium, zirconium, hafnium and vanadium. The most preferred transition metal is titanium. The transition metal complex may be prepared from a transition metal derivative and a chiral ligand. Suitable transition metal derivative are transition metal (IV) halides or transition metal (IV) alkoxides, or transition metal (IV)acetylacetonates. Examples of halide is chloride, alkoxides are butoxide, tert-butoxide, ethoxide and, in particular, n-propoxide, isopropoxide. The most preferred transition metal derivative is titanium tetrachloride or titanium isopropoxide.<br>
The chiral ligand may be a monodentate, bidentate or polydentate ligand, but preferably a chiral branched or unbranched alkyl diol or an aromatic diol or an aminoalcohol. The preferred chiral diol may be a chiral ester or amide of tartaric acid. Suitable optically pure tartaric acid derivatives are, for example, (+) -L-tartaric acid amides, such as (+)-L-tartaric acid bis-(N, N-diallylamide), (+)-L-tartaric acid bis-(N, N-dibenzylamide), (+)-L-tartaric acid bis- (N, N-diisopropylamide), (+)-L-tartaric acid bis- (N, N-dimethylamide), (+)-L-tartaric acid bis- (N- pyrrolidinamide, (+) -L-tartaric acid bis- (N-piperidinamide), (+) -L-tartaric acid bis- (N-morpholinamide), (+) -L-tartaric acid bis- (N-cycloheptylamide) or (+) -L-tartaric acid bis- (N-4-methyl-N-piperazinamide), or dialkyl (+)   -L-tartrate   esters   such   as   dibutyl   (+)-L-tartrate,   di-tert-butyl   (+)   -L-tartrate,<br><br><br>
diisopropyl (+) -L-tartrate, dimethyl (+) -L-tartrate and diethyl (+) -L-tartrate, or (-) -D-tartaric acid amides, such as (-) -D-tartaric acid bis-(N, N-diallylamide), (-)-D-tartaric acid bis-(N, N-dibenzylamide), (-)-D-tartaric acid bis-(N, N- diisopropylamide), (-) -D-tartaric acid bis- (N, N-dimethylamide), (-) -D-tartaric acid bis- (N- pyrrolidinamide), (-) -D-tartaric acid bis- (N-piperidinamide), (-) -D-tartaric acid bis- (N-morpholinamide), (-) -D-tartaric acid bis- (N-cycloheptylamide) or (-) -D-tartaric acid bis- (N-4-methyl-N-piperazinamide), or dialkyl (-) -D-tartrate esters such as dibutyl (-) -D-tartrate, di-tert-butyl (-) -D-tartrate, diisopropyl (-) -D-tartrate, dimethyl (-) -D-tartrate and diethyl (-)-D-tartrate or the like.<br>
The chiral transition metal complex can be prepared by the reaction of transition metal derivative and the complexing chiral ligand, either separately or in the presence of the prochiral sulphide substrate of Formula II. A suitable reagents and solvent, if required may be used to achieve the complexation of transition metal with the ligand. For example the titanium isoproxide is reacted with diethyltartarate directly before addition of the substrate or may be prepared in the presence of the prochiral sulphide of formula II.<br>
The especially preferred titanium complex used advantageously in the present invention is prepared from a chiral diethyltartarate and a titanium(IV) compound, preferably titanium(IV)alkoxide in the presence or absence of water. An especially preferred titanium(IV)alkoxide is titanium(IV)isopropoxide or n-propoxide. When the titanium complex is prepared by reacting titanium tetra chloride with a chiral ligand, a base is advantageously used in the process.<br>
The base used in the enantioselective oxidation may be an inorganic or an organic base; examples of organic base include trimethylamine, triethylamine, tributylamine, triisopropylamine, diisopropylethylamine, pyridine, morpholine, DBU (1,8-diazabicyclo-[5.4.0]-undec-7-ene), DBN (l,5-diazabicyclo-[4.3.0]- non-5-ene), 4-dimethylamino pyridine and mixtures thereof. Examples of inorganic bases include alkali metal carbonate, bicarbonate, hydroxide and mixtures thereof. Examples of alkali metal carbonates  include  lithium carbonate,  sodium  carbonate  and potassium carbonate.<br><br><br>
Examples of alkali metal bicarbonates include sodium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate. Examples of alkali metal hydroxides include sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. Organic bases are preferred for this application and especially suitable bases are amines, preferably triethylamine or N,N-diisopropylethylamine. The amount of base added to the reaction mixture is not very critical but should be adjusted with respect to the respective substrates or can be established by trial.<br>
The metal complex may be added to the reaction mixture containing prochiral sulfide. Alternately, the reaction mixture containing prochiral sulfide may be added to the metal complex. The amount of the chiral titanium complex is not critical to the success. Even in catalytic quantities of chiral titanium complexes are sufficient to give excellent steroselective oxidation of the sulphide and an optimum amount may be worked out by trial in a particular substrate..<br>
Suitable oxidizing agents are any oxidizing agents customarily used for the synthesis of substituted sulphenyl compounds of Formula I, where particular mention may be made of hydroperoxides, such as, for example, alkyl hydro peroxide, arylhydroperoxides and aryl alkyl hydro peroxide. The aryl alkyl hydro peroxide may be cumene hydro peroxide or trityl hydroperoxide. Especially preferred alkyl hydroperoxide is ter-butyl hydroperoxide. The most preferred hydroperoxide is a trityl hydroperoxide because it significantly reduces the amount of sulphone impurity during the oxidation reaction compared with other hydroperoxide. In general, 0.50 to molar excess oxidation equivalents, preferably 0.99-1. 3 equivalents, of the oxidizing agent are used.<br>
The oxidation is carried out at a temperature, for example between 20 - 70 degrees, preferably carried at room temperature or just above room temperature. Lower temperature results in long reaction times and a suitable temperature range is chosen depending on the stability/decomposition of the compounds.<br>
In the process of the present invention, the preparation of the chiral titanium complex is performed at a temperature between 20-70 degrees and optionally in presence of the<br><br><br>
prochiral sulfide substrate. The transition metal complex preparation time is approximately from 0-1.5 hours. Then the oxidizing agent is introduced in the reaction. The enantioselective oxidation time varies depending on the reaction temperature and of the pro-chiral sulphide, and usually completes within 10 minutes to 2.5 hours. In some cases prololnged reaction is not advisable, as the product/starting sulfide degrades during reaction.<br>
If the process is carried out in a suitable manner, the optically pure sulphinyl compound of formula I is obtained in an optical purity of &gt;70%, preferably greater than 80%, and more preferably greater than 95%. By further steps, such as, for example, pH-controlled reprecipitation and/or recrystallization in a suitable solvent, it is possible to further increase the optical purity to even greater than 99.5%. Reprecipitation is carried out via intermediate preparation of suitable salts, such as, for example, potassium or sodium salt.<br>
The obtained crude product may be extracted in an organic solvent. It may also be crystallized in an organic or aqueous solvent resulting in an optically pure product. A suitable metal salt of the compound of Formula I may be obtained by treating the crude product with a base such as NaOH followed by crystallisation of the formed salt in a solvent which may result in a product with an improved optical purity.<br>
Thus process of the present invention is applicable for the preparation of an optically active alkali and/or alkaline earth metal salt of substituted sulphinyl- benzimidazole by treating the optically active substituted sulphinylbenzimidazole compound of Formula I, obtained by enantioselective catalytic oxidation with an alkali and/or alkaline earth metal source. The alkali or alkaline earth metal source may be selected from Na+, Li+, Mg+2, Ca+2 and Ba+2 salts such as bicarbonates, carbonates, hydrides, hydroxides, halides, sulphates, alkoxides and oxides. In particular, sodium hydroxide, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium hydroxide, potassium tertiarybutoxide, barium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride may be used.<br><br><br>
The process of the present invention further includes the optional steps of isolating the alkali or alkaline earth metal salts of the optically active substituted pyridinylmethyl-sulfinyl-benzimidazole compound of Formula 1 by solvent evaporation with or without vacuum, followed by addition of the and organic solvent and/or an antisolvent and filtering the product, and drying, as required. It may be again purified by similar or any known procedures to either increase the optical purity or to reduce the sulphone content, for examples, esomeprazole potassium is purified from alcohol such as methanol to reduce the sulphone impurity.<br>
The products described above can be further processed if desired. Alkali or alkaline earth metal salts of benzimidazole compounds may be exchanged with another alkali or alkaline earth metal salts to prepare a desired PPI for pharmaceutical application. For example, esomeprazole sodium or potassium can be converted into esomeprazole magnesium.<br>
The PPIs obtained by the process of the present invention, for example, esomeprazole magnesium, may be formulated into a dosage form, e.g., tablet, capsule, etc., by combining with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients using known techniques. The resulting dosage form may include a suitable amount of the active ingredient. For example, the resulting dosage form may contain between 5 and 50 mg of esomeprazole magnesium. Further, the dosage form may be immediate release or extended release. The dosage forms may be administered to a mammal in need, as proton pump inhibitors useful for treating ulcers.<br>
