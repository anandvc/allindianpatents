The invention relates to a dosing unit for dosing of solid substances into the supply or mixing hopper of plastic processing machines.<br>
A dosing unit of this type is known from DE OS 25 10 963 and is used for dosing of granular colorants (color granulates) to plastic granulates before they are further processed in injection molding machines, blow molding machines extrusion facilities and the like. The cellular wheel used for conveying the color granulates is flush with the jacket surface of the recess of the housing in which it is arranged, seen in the rotation direction of the cellular wheel only in the area between the entry opening of the discharge channel and the exit opening of the supply container  Seen in the rotation direction of the cellular wheel, in the area between the exit opening of the supply container and the entry opening of the discharge channel, however, the radius of the jacket surface of the recess is greater than the radius of the cellular wheel and there is a marked clearance between the two.<br>
When dosing easy-to-pour granular solid substances, the known dosing unit operates with sufficient accuracy. Powdery and hard-to-pour substances by contrast can only be dosed very imprecisely with it, since the cells of the cellular wheel can transfer greatly fluctuating powder quantities from the supply container into the discharge channel.<br>
A cellular wheel sluice is already known from GB-PS 934 073, and has a cellular wheel arranged inside a cylindrical recess of a housing, the radius of which recess matches that of the cellular wheel.<br><br>
The object underlying the present invention is to improve a dosing unit of the type mentioned at the outset such that it can be used to dose powdery and hard-to-pour solid substances too with high precision into the supply or mixing hopper of plastic processing machines.<br>
The object is attained by a dosing unit having the features stated in claim 1.<br>
Since the radius of the recess surrounding the cellular wheel matches the radius of the cellular wheel in both sections of the jacket surface* between the upper exit opening of the supply container and the lower entry opening of the discharge channel, it is achieved that the lower edge of the exit opening of the supply container acts as a scraper which is moved over the powder-laden cells of the cellular wheel and equalizes their charge.<br>
Since there is provided above the exit opening of the supply container a â€¢shielding plate that projects over this exit opening, the powder quantity directly above the cellular wheel is relieved of the powder supply above it and hence the tendency for the powder to cake together is reduced, which would favor uneven filling of the cells. At the same time, it is achieved that the cellular wheel is always subjected to the same pressure regardless of the level in the supply container, thereby also ensuring an even filling of the cells.<br>
The arrangement of a stirring arm above the shielding plate and of a further stirring arm underneath the shielding plate has the effect of continuously<br><br>
loosening the powder. The stirring arms furthermore push the powder underneath the shielding plate, thus also favoring the even filling of the cells of the cellular wheel.<br>
To facilitate perfect filling of the cells in view of the low pour ability of the powder, the exit opening of the supply container advantageously extends past the upper apex of the cylindrical recess in the housing.<br>
The lower stirring arm advantageously has flexible bristles reaching to the lower edge of the exit opening of the supply container. With these brides, that stop just short of reaching into the cells of the cellular wheel, the cells can be filled particularly quickly and evenly.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a dosing unit for dosing of solid substances into the supply or mixing hopper of plastic processing machines with a fixed supply container tapering in funnel form towards the bottom and having an exit opening at the bottom and having a cellular wheel rotatable about a horizontal axis, arranged in a recess of the housing of the dosing unit and surrounded by a jacket surface that is open on the one hand to the exit opening of said supply container and on the other hand to the entry opening of a discharge channel leading downwards to said supply or mixing hopper and has, seen in the rotation direction of the cellular wheel, between said entry opening of said discharge channel and said exit opening of said supply container a radius matching that of said cellular wheel, wherein said radius of said cellular wheel, seen in its rotation direction,<br><br>
corresponds to the radius of the cylindrical recess also between the exit opening of said supply container and said entry opening of said discharge channel wherein above said exit opening of said supply container a shielding plate projecting over said exit opening is provided, and wherein above said shielding plate a stirring arm and under said shielding plate a further stirring arm is provided.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention is described in the following on the basis of the accompanying drawings in schematic form.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the arrangement of a dosing unit on an injection molding machine and<br>
Fig. 2 shows a vertical section through the lower part of this dosing unit.<br>
Fig. 1 shows an injection molding machine with worm cylinder 1, a deanery and classifying work 2 therein and a mold 3 attached in front of nor ^di nozzle. The plastic granulate is added using a filling hopper 4 and a inlaying hopper 5 to which two dosing units 6 are attached for adding dieing colorants.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a vertical section through the dosing unit 6 which is cuisine Â±T dosing hard-to-pour powders. The dosing unit 6 comprises a hosing adjacent to an overhead supply container 8 for the substance to be dosed. The supply container 8 has a cylindrical form and a bottom 9 tapering downwards to a point in which an exit opening 10 is eccentrically provided.<br><br>
The exit opening 10 empties into a cylindrical recess 11 of the housing 7 in which a cellular wheel 12 is mounted with horizontal rotary axis 13. The rotation direction is indicated by the arrow 14.<br>
opening 10 is covered-by a horizontal shielding plate 15 which relieves the powder underneath the plate 15 and above the cellular wheel 12 from the weight of the powder above the plate 15.<br>
A shaft 16 projects upwards from the center of the bottom 9 "and is driven by an electric motor 17. A horizontal stirring arm 18 is attached to the shaft 16 above the plate 15, and a fritter stirring arm 19 arranged parallel to the bottom 9 is attached below the plate 15. The latter stirring arm 19 is provided with downward pointing bristles 20 reaching to the lower edge 21 of the exit opening 10. The powder is loosened using the stirring arms, and pushed underneath the plate 15 and into the cells 22 of the cellular wheel 12.<br>
opening 10 extends from the vicinity of the shaver 16 past the upper apex 23 of the recess 11, thereby giving sufficient opportunity for even filling of the cells 22. Powder heaped up over the filled cells 22 is scraped off at the lower edge 21 of the exit opening 10 when the cellular wheel 12 is rotated in the direction of the arrow 14. The cells 22 empty into a discharge channel 24 that leads on to the mixing hopper 5. Emptying of the cells 22 is assisted by a scraper 25 inserted from the outside into the discharge channel 24.<br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A dosing unit for dosing of solid substances into the supply or mixing hopper of plastic processing machines with a fixed supply container tapering in funnel form towards the bottom and having an exit opening at the bottom and having a cellular wheel rotatable about a horizontal axis  arranged in a recess of the housing of the dosing unit and surrounded by a jacket surface that is open on the one hand to the exit opening of said supply container and on the other hand to the entry opening of a discharge channel leading downwards to said supply or mixing hopper and has, seen in the rotation direction of the cellular wheel, between said entry opening of said discharge channel and said exit opening of said supply container a radius matching that of said cellular wheel, wherein said radius of said cellular wheel (12)  seen in its rotation direction, corresponds to the radius of the cylindrical recess (11) also between the exit opening (10) of said supply container (8) and said entry opening of said discharge channel (24) wherein above said exit opening (10) of said supply container (8) a shielding plate (15) projecting over said exit opening (10) is provided  and wherein above said shielding plate (15) a stirring arm (18) and under said shielding plate (15) a further stirring arm (19) is provided.<br>
