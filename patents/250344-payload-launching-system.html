				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
This invention relates to a payload launching system for accelerating a rocket, carrying or not carrying<br>
a payload, particularly but not exclusively, in order to reduce launch costs.<br>
In WO 0162534 there is described an acceleration system comprising a flywheel, able to rotate on an<br>
axis, and a cable, an end portion of which is adapted to releasably couping with a load, and a remote<br>
end portion of which can be engaged with the rotating flywheel.<br>
The flywheel is provided with a surface for receiving a portion of the cable remote from the said end<br>
portion and the surface has a curved profile the radial dimension of which increases progressively<br>
from the said axis in an arcuate direction of the said axis. After the remote end portion of the cable is<br>
engaged with the flywheel, the remote end portion of the cable remains then restrained near the centre<br>
of the flywheel and the cable winds up along the curved profile, accelerating the load.<br>
The acceleration system provides a good solution for accelerating a heavy load with a uniform<br>
acceleration and may be used for accelerating an aircraft to take-off speed.<br>
The acceleration system, however, describes no practical way to accelerate a rocket that may be<br>
attached to the cable, considering that the top part of the rocket usually comprises a conical shroud of<br>
rather light construction and sometimes a payload such as a remote sensing satellite.<br>
An objective of the payload launching system is to accelerate a rocket.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a payload launching system comprising a cable,<br>
an end portion of which is adapted for Teleasably couping with a rocket, a rotary member adapted for<br>
rotation on an axis and drive means for disengageably engaging with the rotary member so as to rotate<br>
the rotary member on the axis characterised in that the rotary member is provided with a surface for<br>
receiving a portion of the cable remote from the said end portion and the surface has a curved profile<br>
the radial dimension of which increases progressively from the said axis in an arcuate direction of the<br>
said axis. Means for engaging the said remote end portion of the cable with the rotary member, while<br>
it is rotating, is also provided. The system also comprises a number of transferring means at the remote<br>
end portion of the cable, that transfer the pulling force of the cable to the rocket at structurally<br>
appropriate locations on the rocket during the acceleration. Following is a description, by way of<br>
example only and with reference to the accompanying drawings, of one method of carrying the<br>
invention into effect.<br>
In the drawings:<br>

launching system at the very beginning of the acceleration.<br>

launching system at the end of the acceleration.<br>

launching system a short moment after the acceleration.<br>

the acceleration.<br>

acceleration.<br>
Figure 8 is a diagrammatic perspective view of the internal structure of the rocket and of the<br>
transferring means during the acceleration.<br>
Referring now to Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3 of the drawings, which are diagrammatic<br>
conceptual representations, there is described an embodiment of a payload launching system<br>
(10) comprising a wheel (11) rotatably mounted on an axis (12) and driven, so as to rotate on<br>
the axis (12), by means of a power source (not shown) acting on the wheel (11). The wheel<br>
(11) is provided with a surface (13) for receiving the cable (14). The surface (13), when<br>
viewed axially of the axis (12), is of a curved formation the profile of which extending<br>
longitudinally of the surface (13) and in a radial direction from the axis (12) increases<br>
progressively from the axis (12) in an arcuate direction of the axis (12).<br>
A number of transferring means (15) are provided at the. other end of the cable (14). The<br>
transferring means (15) are so designed that they transfer the pulling force from the cable to<br>
the rocket (16) at appropriate locations on the structure of the rocket during the acceleration.<br>
Figure 8 shows an example of the design of transferring means and of the locations on the<br>
rocket structure where they are able to transfer the pulling force of the cable to the rocket.<br>
Means (not shown) is provided for pushing an end portion of the cable (14) towards the wheel<br>
(11), in an axial direction of the wheel (11), so that the distal end of the cable (14) remote<br>
from the rocket (16) is restrained near the centre of the wheel (11) and the end portion of the<br>
cable (14) locates on the profiled surface (13).<br>
In a starting position, an end portion of the cable (14) is held away from the profiled surface<br>
(13) of the wheel (11). The power source is then operated so as to rotate the wheel (11).<br>
When the rotational energy is sufficient to provide power to accelerate the transferring means<br>
(15) and the rocket (16), then the said means is operated to push the distal end of the cable<br>
(14) towards the wheel (11) so that the distal end of the cable (14) remote from the rocket<br>
(16) is restrained near the centre of the wheel (11) and the end portion of the cable (14)<br>
locates on the profiled surface (13). The effect of the profile of the surface (13) is such that<br>
the cable (14) draws the transferring means (15) and the rocket (16) in a direction towards the<br>
wheel (11), initially at low speed and then at progressively increasing speed as the radial<br>
distance of the profile of the surface (13) from the axis (12) increases.<br>
Referring now to Figure 4 of the drawings, which is a diagrammatic conceptual<br>
representation, there is shown an embodiment of a payload launching system (20) in<br>
accordance with the present invention for accelerating a rocket. The system comprises a<br>
wheel (21) rotatably mounted on an axis (22) and driven, so as to rotate on the axis (22), by<br>
means of a power source acting on the wheel (21). The wheel (21) is provided with a surface<br>
(23) for receiving a cable (24). The surface (23), when viewed axially of the axis (22), is of a<br>
curved formation the profile of which extending longitudinally of the surface (23) and in a<br>
radial direction from the axis (22) increases progressively from the axis (22) in an arcuate<br>
direction of the axis (22). The other end portion of cable (24) is turned on an additional rotary<br>
member (25), which is adapted for rotation on a second axis (26). A second cable (27) is<br>
attached to one of its end portion to the additional rotary member (25) and is connected on its<br>
other end portion to the rocket (29). Means (not shown) is provided for pushing an end portion<br>
of the cable (24) towards the wheel (21), in an axial direction of the wheel (21).<br>
In a starting position, an end portion of the cable (27) remote from the additional rotary<br>
member (25) is connected to the transferring means (28), while the distal end of the cable<br>
(24) is held away from the profiled surface (23) of the wheel (21). The power source is then<br>
operated so as to rotate the wheel (21). When the rotational energy is sufficient to provide<br>
power to accelerate the transferring means (28) and the rocket (29), then the said means is<br>
operated to push the distal end of the cable (24) towards the wheel (21) so that the end<br>
portion of the cable (24) remote from the additional rotary member (25) is restrained at the<br>
centre of the wheel (21) and the distal end of the cable (24) locates on the profiled surface<br>
(23). The arrangement is such that the additional rotary member (25) is of a lighter<br>
construction than the wheel (21) and may be arranged such as to accomodate the length of<br>
the cable (27) more easily than the profiled surface (23).<br><br>
Referring now to Figure 5 and Figure 6 of the drawings, which are diagrammatic conceptual<br>
representations, there is shown a system (30) which operates in accordance with the principle<br>
described with reference to Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3 of the drawings. The power<br>
source, the rocket and the transferring means are not shown.<br>
The distal end of the cable (33) is provided with a ball (35). The cable (34) is held up to now<br>
away from the wheel (31), rotating on the axis (32), and is now pushed by the said engaging<br>
means in an axial direction towards the wheel (31) so as to locate the ball (35) in the space<br>
provided in the wheel (31), located adjacent a centre of the wheel (31). The ball (35) is now<br>
restrained with the rotating wheel (31) and pulls the cable (34) with it.<br>
As the wheel (31) continues its rotation, the cable (34) locates on the curved profiled surface<br>
(33), accelerating the rocket.<br>
In Figure 6, the rotating wheel (31) is now in an end position of the operation of the payload<br>
launching system; the wheel (31) has completed about one and a quarter of a full rotation and<br>
the cable (34) is wound up on the curved profiled surface (33) and the acceleration is<br>
complete.<br>
The rocket then continues its trajectory, and the wheel (31) continues its rotation with its<br>
remaining rotational energy.<br>
Figure 7 is a diagrammatic perspective view of the rocket (16,29) and of the transferring<br>
means (15,28) attached to the cable (14,24) during the acceleration.<br>
Referring now to Figure 8 of the drawings, there is shown a view of a traditionally designed<br>
rocket comprising, in this particular example, two stages and, in this particular example, two<br>
engines functioning with liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen; a first stage, comprising a first<br>
stage engine, a fuel tank containing liquid hydrogen (H), a fuel tank containing liquid oxygen<br>
(O), and a second stage, comprising a second stage engine, a fuel tank containing liquid<br>
hydrogen (H), a fuel tank containing liquid oxygen (O).<br>
The rocket also comprises a payload such as a remote sensing satellite and a conical shroud<br>
on top, enclosing and protecting the payload and providing good aerodynamic characteristics<br>
to the rocket. Two of a number of transferring means are shown transferring the pulling force<br>
from the cable to the rocket at points located, in this particular example, after the first stage<br>
and after the second stage of the rocket.<br>
Advantage of the payload launching system :<br>
The transferring means are able to transfer the pulling force of the cable to the rocket at<br>
appropriate locations on the structure of the rocket. Any type of rocket may be used with the<br>
payload launching system but it is possible, particularly, to use a traditionally designed rocket.<br>
This traditional design, shown on Figure 8, is the most efficient for most applications. The<br>
transferring means transfer the pulling force of the cable to the rocket after the front part of<br>
the rocket.<br>
The rocket begins its trajectory with a significant speed. Because a significant energy is<br>
imparted to the rocket at the beginning of the launch, a smaller rocket can be used, carrying<br>
less fuel, powered by a smaller size first stage engine. This leads to a more simple and more<br>
efficient design of the rocket, and allows, for example, to choose those fuels that have the<br>
highest specific impulse and that are more expensive to produce, since they are used in a<br>
smaller quantity. All this leads to a more efficient operation and considerably lower costs.<br>
Disadvantages of the payload launching system :<br>
The conical shroud on top of the rocket and the structure of the rocket sustain higher loads<br>
because of the significant speed in the lower, denser layers of the atmosphere.<br>
The conical shroud and the rocket, however, because of their respective geometric structures,<br>
can be reinforced efficiently.<br><br>
In various preferred embodiment of the payload launching system :<br>
A particular embodiment of the payload launching system may also include means for<br>
disconnecting the cable (14, 24) from the transferring means (15,28). In another particular<br>
embodiment of the payload launching system, these means include an explosive device.<br>
A particular embodiment of the payload launching system may also include detecting means<br>
for detecting the passage of the rocket at some chosen point and operate the means for<br>
disconnecting the cable (14, 24) from the transferring means (15,28). These detecting means<br>
may be located on the system or on the ground.<br>
A well may be used with the payload launching system; the wheel would be at the top of the<br>
well and the rocket in a starting position near the bottom of the well. Or the wheel may be on<br>
the top of a structure and the rocket in a starting position on the ground or at the bottom of a<br>
well located below the structure.<br>
A structure laying in a volume of liquid, such as water, and providing enough space for the<br>
rocket to move inside it during the acceleration may be used with the payload launching<br>
system. This structure may be positioned-at the most appropriate location and latitude.<br>
In one particular embodiment of the payload launching system, the transferring means do not<br>
continue with the rocket; the rocket continues its trajectory on its own as shown on Figure 3.<br>
In one embodiment, the transferring means are designed so that they move away from the<br>
rocket some time after the acceleration.<br>
In another embodiment, the transferring means are attached with the rocket at some points of<br>
the rocket, and means for detaching the transferring means is provided.<br>
In another embodiment, the means for detaching the transferring means from the rocket<br>
include an explosive device.<br>
A particular embodiment of the payload launching system may also include detecting means<br>
for detecting the passage of the rocket at some chosen point and operate the means for<br>
detaching the transferring means from the rocket. These detecting means may be located on<br>
the system or on the ground.<br>
An aerodynamic structure may be provided on a transferring means in order to pull a<br>
transferring means away from the rocket. The flow of air caused by the movement of the<br>
rocket during or after the acceleration creates an aerodynamic force on the aerodynamic<br>
structure that pulls the transferring means away from the rocket.<br>
In a particular embodiment, a transferring means may be designed so as to contain the<br>
external structure of the rocket near a fuel tank, so that the structure of the rocket at this point<br>
does not substantially increase because of the lateral pressure induced by the acceleration.<br>
A net laid close to the ground or a parachute on a transferring means may be used to recover<br>
a transferring means after acceleration.<br>
An empty space may be provided below the rocket in order to allow the exhaust gases to<br>
accumulate in this space when firing the first stage engine while the rocket is at the very<br>
beginning of the acceleration.<br>
Means for keeping the rocket in place at the very beginning of the acceleration when the first<br>
stage engine is fired may be provided.<br>
External storage fuel tanks may be provided near a particular embodiment of the payload<br>
launching system for ease of operation.<br>
A particular example of means for engaging an end portion of the cable with the rotating<br>
wheel is a human operator who pushes that end portion towards the wheel.<br>
A clutch may be provided between the drive means and the wheel.<br>
It is not necessary in principle to ignite the first stage engine at the beginning of the<br>
acceleration; the first stage engine may be ignited at any time during the acceleration or after<br>
the acceleration.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the payload launching system, as shown on Figure 5 and<br>
Figure 6, a ball at the end of the cable restrains the cable at a centre of the wheel; in another<br>
embodiment of a payload launching system, the end of the cable is shaped so as to be<br>
restrained by a number of spaced protrusions located adjacent a centre of the wheel.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the payload launching system, means for extracting the cable<br>
from the flywheel, while the flywheel is rotating, is provided. These means allow, particularly<br>
but not exclusively, to have the cable and the flywheel ready for another operation quickly.<br>

rocket respective to the direction of movement of a rocket.<br>
The expression "after the front part of a rocket" means that point of a rocket that is located<br>
after the front part of a rocket respective to the direction of movement of a rocket. That is,<br>
there is, respective to the direction of movement of the rocket, first the front part, then the part<br>
after the front part, then the back part of the rocket.<br>
The expression "a location after the first stage" means that part of the first stage that is the<br>
most distant from the front part of the rocket.<br>
The expression "a location after the second stage" means that part of the second stage that is<br>

Remark:<br>
In the particular embodiments of the payload launching system discussed and shown on all of<br>
the drawings, the structurally appropriate points where the transferring means transfer the<br>
pulling force from the cable to the rocket are located after the front part of the rocket.<br>
That is, the transferring means transfer the pulling force from the cable to the rocket at points<br>
on the rocket located after the front part of the rocket.<br>
In these particular embodiments, the transferring means are rigid metallic structures<br>
extending from the end of the cable to the back of the rocket. They are so shaped that they do<br>
not interfere with the front part of the rocket, as shown on Figure 7 and Figure 8. At the points<br>
where they transfer the pulling force to the rocket, these metallic structure are so shaped that<br>
they comprise an extension on their structure that lies immediately below that part of the<br>
rocket that sustains this pulling force. In these example, these transferring means are not<br>
attached to the rocket. The said extensions are so shaped that they have the form of a hook<br>
and they are restrained to the rocket for as long as the pulling force from the cable is<br>
transferred to the rocket due to their particular shape. In these particular embodiments, shown<br>
on all drawings, the rocket is accelerated vertically and the transferring means fall away from<br>
the rocket as soon as the transfer of the pulling force from the cable to the rocket ceases.<br>

the rocket (29), and at least one of the said transferring means (28) transfers the said<br>
pulling force to the rocket (29) at a point located on the rocket (29) away from the base<br>
of the rocket(29).<br>
3. A payload launching system as claimed in any of the preceding claims, wherein the<br>
transferring means (15,28) are adapted to transfer the pulling force from the cable<br>
(14,27) to the rocket (16,29) at at least a point located after the first stage of the rocket<br>
(16,29).<br>
4. A payload launching system as claimed in any of the preceding claims, wherein the<br>
transferring means (15,28) are adapted to transfer the pulling force from the cable<br>
(14,27) to the rocket (16,29) at at least a point located after the second stage of the<br>
rocket (16,29).<br>
5. A payload launching system as claimed in any of the preceding claims, wherein the<br>
transferring means (15,28) are adapted to transfer the pulling force from the cable<br>
(14,27) to the rocket (16,29) at at least a point located after a payload carried by the<br>
rocket (16, 29).<br>
6. A payload launching system as claimed in any of the preceding claims, wherein there<br>
is provided means for disconnecting the cable (14,27) from said transferring means (15,<br>
28).<br>
7. A payload launching system as claimed in any of the preceding claims, wherein the<br>
rocket (16,29) comprises at least a point on its structure where said transferring means<br>
(15,28) is able to transfer the pulling force from the cable (14, 27) to the rocket (16,29).;.<br>
8. A payload launching system as claimed in any of the preceding claims, wherein the<br>
rocket (16,29) comprises points on its structure where said transferring means is<br>
attached to the rocket (16,29).<br>
9. A payload launching system as claimed in any of the preceding claims, wherein there<br>
is provided means for detaching said transferring means.<br>
10. A payload launching system as claimed in any of the preceding claims, wherein<br>
there is provided means for moving said transferring means (15, 28) away from the<br>
rocket (16,29) so that the rocket (16,29) is able to continue its trajectory unobstructed by<br>
it.<br>
11. A payload launching system as claimed in claim 10, wherein the means for moving a<br>
transferring means (15,28) include an aerodynamic structure located on said transferring<br>
means (15, 28)<br><br>
This invention relates to a system for launching a payload. A rotating flywheel (11)<br>
accelerates a traditionally designed rocket (16) to a significant speed. Rotational energy from<br>
the flywheel (11) is transferred in the form of kinetic energy through a spiral surface and a<br>
cable (14) to the rocket (16). The system comprises a smaller rocket (16) carrying less fuel,<br>
provided with a smaller first stage engine. All other components of the system are re-used.<br>
This leads to a simpler and more efficient design of the rocket (16) and to a considerable<br>
reduction in launch costs.</td>
