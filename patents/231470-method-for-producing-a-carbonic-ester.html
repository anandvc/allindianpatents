				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Method for producing a carbonic ester<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present@@@ invention relates to a method for pro-<br>
ducing a carbonic ester from an organometal compound<br>
and carbon dioxide. More particularly, the present in-<br>
vention is concerned with a method for producing a car-<br>
bonic ester, comprising the steps of: (1) performing a<br>
reaction between a first organometal compound mixture<br>
and carbon dioxide, wherein the first organometal com-<br>
pound mixture comprises a mixture of a reactive or-<br>
ganometal compound having in its molecule at least two<br>
metal-oxygen-carbon linkages and an unregenerable unre-<br>
active compound which is derived from the reactive or-<br>
ganometal compound, to thereby obtain a reaction mix-<br>
ture containing a carbonic ester formed by the reaction,<br>
the unregenerable unreactive compound, and a regener-<br>
able metamorphic organometal compound derived from the<br>
reactive organometal compound, (2) separating the reac-<br>
tion mixture into a first portion containing the car-<br>
bonic ester and the unregenerable unreactive compound,<br>
and a second portion containing the regenerable meta-<br>
morphic organometal compound, and (3) reacting the sec-<br><br>
ond portion of the reaction mixture with an alcohol to<br>
form a second organometal compound mixture and water<br>
and removing the water from the second organometal com-<br>
pound mixture, wherein the second organometal compound<br>
mixture comprises a mixture of a reactive organometal<br>
compound having in its molecule at least two metal<br>
-oxygen-carbon linkages and an unregenerable unreactive<br>
compound which is derived from the reactive organometal<br>
compound.<br>
By the method of the present invention, a carbonic<br>
ester can be produced in high yield from an organometal<br>
compound having in its molecule at least two metal<br>
-oxygen-carbon linkages and carbon dioxide. One advan-<br>
tage of this method is that carbon dioxide has neither<br>
toxicity nor corrosiveness and is inexpensive. Further,<br>
the method of the present invention is advantageous not<br>
only in that the organometal compound after use in this<br>
method can be regenerated and recycled for reuse in the<br>
method, but also in that the unregenerable unreactive<br>
organometal compound formed in the method can be re-<br>
moved from the reaction system, thereby realizing an<br>
efficient and stable production of a carbonic ester.<br>
Moreover, there is no need for the use of a large<br>
amount of a dehydrating agent, thereby preventing oc-<br>
currence of wastes derived from the dehydrating agent.<br><br>
Therefore, the method of the present invention is com-<br>
mercially very useful and has high commercial value.<br>
Prior Art<br>
A carbonic ester is a useful compound. For exam-<br>
ple, a carbonic ester is used as additives for various<br>
purposes, such as a gasoline additive for improving the<br>
octane number of a gasoline, and a diesel fuel additive<br>
for reducing the amount of particles in an exhaust gas<br>
generated by the burning of a diesel fuel. A carbonic<br>
ester is also used as an alkylation agent, a carbonyla-<br>
tion agent, a solvent and the like in the field of the<br>
synthesis of organic compounds, such as polycarbonate,<br>
urethane, pharmaceuticals and agrichemicals. A car-<br>
bonic ester is also used as an electrolyte for a lith-<br>
ium battery, a raw material for producing a lubricant<br>
oil and a raw material for producing a deoxidizer which<br>
can be used for preventing boiler pipes from rusting.<br>
As a conventional method for producing a carbonic<br>
ester, there can be mentioned a method in which phos-<br>
gene used as a carbonyl source is reacted with an alco-<br>
hol, thereby producing a carbonic ester. Since phos-<br>
gene used in this method is extremely harmful and<br>
highly corrosive, this method is disadvantageous in<br>
that the transportation and storage of phosgene need<br><br>
detailed care and, also, there is a large cost for the<br>
maintenance of production equipment and for assuring<br>
safety. Further, this method poses a problem in that<br>
it is necessary to dispose of hydrochloric acid pro-<br>
duced as a waste by-product.<br>
Another conventional method for producing a car-<br>
bonic ester is an oxidative carbonylation method in<br>
which carbon monoxide used as a carbonyl source is re-<br>
acted with an alcohol and oxygen in the presence of a<br>
catalyst, such as copper chloride, thereby producing a<br>
carbonic ester. In this method, carbon monoxide (which<br>
is extremely harmful) is used under high pressure;<br>
therefore, this method is disadvantageous in that there<br>
is a large cost for the maintenance of production<br>
equipment and for assuring safety. In addition, this<br>
method poses a problem in that a side reaction occurs,<br>
such as oxidation of carbon monoxide to form carbon di-<br>
oxide. For these reasons, it has been desired to de-<br>
velop a safer and more efficient method for producing a<br>
carbonic ester.<br>
In these conventional methods in which phosgene or<br>
carbon monoxide is used as a raw material, a halogen,<br>
such as chlorine, is contained in the raw material it-<br>
self or in the catalyst used. Therefore, in the case<br>
of these methods, a carbonic ester obtained contains a<br><br>
trace amount of a halogen which cannot be completely<br>
removed by a simple purification step. When such car-<br>
bonic ester is used as a gasoline additive, a light oil<br>
additive or a material for producing electronic equip-<br>
ment, there is a danger that the halogen contained in<br>
the carbonic ester causes corrosion of equipment. For<br>
reducing the amount of a halogen in the carbonic ester<br>
to only a trace amount, it is necessary to perform a<br>
thorough purification of the carbonic ester. For this<br>
reason, it has been desired to develop a method for<br>
producing a carbonic ester, which does not use any of a<br>
halogen-containing raw material and a halogen<br>
-containing catalyst.<br>
On the other hand, a method has been put to prac-<br>
tical use, in which carbon dioxide is reacted with eth-<br>
ylene oxide or the like to obtain a cyclic carbonic es-<br>
ter, and the obtained cyclic carbonic ester is reacted<br>
with methanol, thereby producing dimethyl carbonate.<br>
This method is advantageous in that carbon dioxide as a<br>
raw material is harmless, and a corrosive substance,<br>
such as hydrochloric acid, is substantially neither<br>
used nor generated. However, this method poses the<br>
following problems. Ethylene glycol is by-produced in<br>
this method; therefore, from the viewpoint of cost re-<br>
duction, it is necessary to find ways to effectively<br><br>
utilize the by-produced ethylene glycol. Further, it<br>
is difficult to perform safe transportation of ethylene<br>
(which is a raw material for producing ethylene oxide)<br>
and ethylene oxide. Therefore, for obviating the need<br>
for the transportation, it is necessary that a plant<br>
for producing a carbonic ester by this method be built<br>
at a location which is adjacent to a plant for produc-<br>
ing ethylene and ethylene oxide.<br>
There is also known a method in which carbon diox-<br>
ide used as a carbonyl source is subjected to an equi-<br>
librium reaction with an alcohol in the presence of a<br>
catalyst comprising an organometal compound having a<br>
metal-oxygen-carbon linkage, thereby forming a carbonic<br>
ester and water. This equilibrium reaction is repre-<br>
sented by the following formula (3):<br><br>
This method is advantageous in that carbon dioxide and<br>
an alcohol as raw materials are harmless. However,<br><br>
this method employs an equilibrium reaction in which a<br>
carbonic ester and water are simultaneously formed as<br>
products. Also in the case of the above-mentioned oxi-<br>
dative carbonylation method using carbon monoxide, wa-<br>
ter is formed. However, the oxidative carbonylation<br>
method does not employ an equilibrium reaction. The<br>
equilibrium of an equilibrium reaction using carbon di-<br>
oxide as a raw material is thermodynamically biased to-<br>
ward the original system. Therefore, the method using<br>
the equilibrium reaction has a problem in that, for<br>
producing a carbonic ester in high yield, it is neces-<br>
sary that the carbonic ester and water as products be<br>
removed from the reaction system. Further, there is<br>
also a problem in that the water formed decomposes a<br>
catalyst, so that not only is the reaction hindered,<br>
but also the number of turnovers of the catalyst (i.e.,<br>
the number of cycles of regeneration and reuse) is only<br>
2 or 3. For solving this problem, various methods for<br>
removing water (which is a product) by using a dehy-<br>
drating agent have been proposed.<br>
For example, there has been proposed a method in<br>
which an alcohol and carbon dioxide are reacted with<br>
each other in the presence of a metal alkoxide as a<br>
catalyst, thereby forming a carbonic ester and water,<br>
wherein a large amount of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide<br><br>
(DCC) (which is an expensive organic dehydrating agent)<br>
or the like is used as a dehydrating agent (see Collect.<br>
Czech. Chem. Commun. Vol. 60, 687-692 (1995)). This<br>
method has a problem in that the dehydrating agent af-<br>
ter use cannot be regenerated, resulting in the occur-<br>
rence of a large amount of a waste derived from the de-<br>
hydrating agent.<br>
Another method for producing a carbonic ester uses<br>
a carboxylic acid orthoester as an organic dehydrating<br>
agent (see Unexamined Japanese Patent Application Laid-<br>
Open Specification No. Hei 11-35521). (In this patent<br>
document, there are descriptions reading: "a carboxylic<br>
acid orthoester is reacted with carbon dioxide" and "an<br>
acetal is reacted with carbon dioxide". However, as a<br>
result of recent studies in the art, it is generally<br>
presumed that the actual reaction route is as follows.<br>
"An alcohol and carbon dioxide are reacted with each<br>
other to obtain a carbonic ester and water. The water<br>
is reacted with a carboxylic acid orthoester.") This<br>
method has problems in that a carboxylic acid or-<br>
thoester (which is an expensive compound) is used as a<br>
dehydrating agent, and methyl acetate is by-produced<br>
(see "Kagaku Sochi (Chemical Equipment)", Vol. 41, No.2,<br>
52-54 (1999)). Thus, this method is as defective as<br>
the above-mentioned methods.<br><br>
Further, another method uses a large amount of an<br>
acetal as an organic dehydrating agent (see German Pat-<br>
ent No. 4310109). There is also a patent document in<br>
which it is described that an acetal and carbon dioxide<br>
are reacted with each other by using, as a catalyst, a<br>
metal alkoxide or dibutyltin oxide (see Unexamined<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Specification No.<br>
2001-31629). (With respect to the reaction described<br>
in the latter, as a result of recent studies in the art,<br>
it is generally presumed that the actual reaction route<br>
is as follows. "An alcohol and carbon dioxide are re-<br>
acted with each other to obtain a carbonic ester and<br>
water. The water is then reacted with an acetal.")<br>
However, these patent documents do not teach or suggest<br>
a method for efficiently producing an acetal without<br>
forming a waste. Further, the methods disclosed in<br>
these patent documents have a problem in that, when an<br>
acetal is used as a dehydrating agent, large amounts of<br>
by-products, such as a ketone and an aldehyde, are<br>
formed as wastes.<br>
The effects aimed at by the methods which employ<br>
an organic dehydrating agent are to improve the number<br>
of turnovers of a catalyst. However, an organic dehy-<br>
drating agent is consumed in a stoichiometric amount in<br>
accordance with the formation of a carbonic ester (and<br><br>
water as a by-product), so that a large amount of an<br>
organic dehydrating agent is consumed, thus forming a<br>
large amount of a degeneration product of the organic<br>
dehydrating agent. Therefore, it is necessary to per-<br>
form an additional step of regenerating a large amount<br>
of a degenerated organic dehydrating agent. Further,<br>
in spite of the use of an organic dehydrating agent in<br>
a large amount, the possibility still remains that de-<br>
activation of a catalyst occurs. The reason is as fol-<br>
lows. In the conventional method for producing a car-<br>
bonic ester by using the equilibrium reaction of the<br>
above-mentioned formula (3), carbon dioxide is in a su-<br>
percritical state. In general, in supercritical carbon<br>
dioxide, a catalyst exhibits poor solubility, and the<br>
catalyst particles are likely to cohere together.<br>
Therefore, there is a problem in that, when an organo-<br>
tin compound (which is susceptive to polymerization) is<br>
used as a catalyst in supercritical carbon dioxide, the<br>
organotin compound as a catalyst is likely to be deac-<br>
tivated due to its polymerization.<br>
There has also been proposed a method which em-<br>
ploys a solid dehydrating agent (see Applied Catalysis<br>
Vol. 142. L1-L3 (1996)). However, this method has a<br>
problem in that the solid dehydrating agent cannot be<br>
regenerated, thus forming a large amount of a waste.<br><br>
There is also known a method in which an alcohol<br>
(methanol) and carbon dioxide are reacted with each<br>
other in the presence of a metal oxide (dibutyltin ox-<br>
ide) to thereby obtain a reaction mixture, and the ob-<br>
tained reaction mixture is cooled and introduced into a<br>
packed column containing a solid dehydrating agent,<br>
thereby gradually displacing the equilibrium toward a<br>
carbonic ester while effecting dehydration, to obtain a<br>
carbonic ester (see Unexamined Japanese Patent Applica-<br>
tion Laid-Open Specification No. 2001-247519). This<br>
method is based on a technique in which a conventional<br>
technique of using a dehydrating agent is combined with<br>
the known phenomenon that the water adsorbability of a<br>
conventional dehydrating agent (such as molecular<br>
sieves) exhibits a temperature dependency. A dehydrat-<br>
ing agent (such as molecular sieves) exhibits lower wa-<br>
ter adsorbability at high temperatures than at low tem-<br>
peratures. Therefore, for removing a trace amount of<br>
water (by-product) from a reaction mixture which con-<br>
tains a largely excess amount of a low molecular weight<br>
alcohol used as a solvent, it is necessary to cool the<br>
reaction mixture in which an equilibrium is achieved<br>
under high temperature and pressure conditions, before<br>
introducing the reaction mixture into a packed column<br>
containing a solid dehydrating agent. In addition, for<br><br>
increasing the conversion of an alcohol as a raw mate-<br>
rial, it is necessary that the reaction mixture which<br>
has been cooled and dehydrated in the packed column be<br>
returned to high temperature and pressure conditions<br>
which are necessary for the reaction. Thus, this<br>
method has problems in that it is necessary to consume<br>
an extremely large amount of energy for cooling and<br>
heating, and a large amount of a solid dehydrating<br>
agent is needed. This method is very widely used for<br>
producing an aliphatic ester having a relatively large<br>
equilibrium constant. However, in the production of a<br>
carbonic ester from carbon dioxide and an alcohol,<br>
wherein the equilibrium of the reaction is largely bi-<br>
ased toward the original system, this method cannot be<br>
suitably used because this method poses a serious prob-<br>
lem that it is necessary to repeat the above-mentioned<br>
operation which needs a very large consumption of en-<br>
ergy for cooling and heating. Further, for regenerat-<br>
ing a degenerated dehydrating agent which has adsorbed<br>
water to saturation, it is generally necessary to cal-<br>
cine the degenerated dehydrating agent at several hun-<br>
dreds °C, thus rendering this method commercially dis-<br>
advantageous. Furthermore, in this method, only one<br>
(water) of the two products of an equilibrium reaction<br>
is removed and, therefore, there is a problem in that,<br><br>
when the equilibrium reaction progresses to increase<br>
the carbonic ester concentration of the reaction system,<br>
the reaction becomes unlikely to progress any more,<br>
that is, this method is still under the restriction of<br>
an equilibrium reaction. In addition, dibutyltin oxide,<br>
which is used as a catalyst in this method, exhibits an<br>
extremely poor solubility in methanol and, hence, al-<br>
most all of dibutyltin oxide as a catalyst remains in<br>
solid form in the reaction mixture. Therefore, when<br>
the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature in a<br>
cooling step, the reaction mixture turns into a white<br>
slurry, thus causing a problem in that, in a subsequent<br>
dehydration step performed using a packed column con-<br>
taining a dehydrating agent, the slurry causes clogging<br>
of the packed column.<br>
In general, a dehydration method in which water is<br>
removed by distillation is well-known in the field of<br>
organic synthesis reactions. However, in the field of<br>
the production of a carbonic ester from carbon dioxide<br>
and an alcohol, although "Study Report of Asahi Glass<br>
Association for Promotion of Industrial Technology<br>
(Asahi Garasu Kogyogijutsu Shoreikai Kenkyu Hokoku)",<br>
Vol. 33, 31-45 (1978) states that "dehydration by dis-<br>
tillation is now being studied", there have been no re-<br>
ports or the like which state that a dehydration method<br><br>
using distillation has been completed.<br>
There has been a report which mentions a distilla-<br>
tion separation of a carbonic ester from a reaction<br>
mixture containing a metal alkoxide, wherein the reac-<br>
tion mixture is obtained by reacting carbon dioxide and<br>
an alcohol with each other in the presence of a metal<br>
alkoxide catalyst; however, it is known in the art that,<br>
when a metal alkoxide catalyst is used, a distillation<br>
separation causes a reverse reaction, thus rendering it<br>
difficult to recover a carbonic ester by distillation<br>
separation (see "Journal of the Chemical Society of Ja-<br>
pan (Nippon Kagaku Kaishi)", No. 10, 1789-1794 (1975)).<br>
Especially, no method is known by which a carbonic es-<br>
ter having a high boiling point can be separated in<br>
high yield from a reaction mixture containing a metal<br>
alkoxide.<br>
On the other hand, a metal alkoxide is so unstable<br>
that it is susceptive to deactivation due to the mois-<br>
ture in the air. Therefore, in the above-mentioned<br>
method, the handling of a metal alkoxide needs strict<br>
care. For this reason, no conventional technique using<br>
a metal alkoxide catalyst has been employed in the com-<br>
mercial production of a carbonic ester. A metal alkox-<br>
ide catalyst is an expensive compound, and no technique<br>
is known for regenerating a deactivated metal alkoxide<br><br>
catalyst.<br>
There has been proposed a method for producing a<br>
carbonic ester by using a dibutyltin dialkoxide as a<br>
catalyst, in which, during the reaction, the catalyst<br>
is formed from dibutyltin oxide (which is stable to<br>
moisture) added to the reaction system (see Japanese<br>
Patent No. 3128576). This method has a problem in that,<br>
although dibutyltin oxide which is charged into the re-<br>
action system is stable, the dibutyltin oxide is con-<br>
verted, during the reaction, into a dibutyltin dialkox-<br>
ide, which is unstable. Therefore, this method cannot<br>
solve the above-mentioned problem of the instability of<br>
a metal alkoxide catalyst. Specifically, this method<br>
has a defect in that, once the reaction mixture is re-<br>
moved from the reaction system for isolating the car-<br>
bonic ester obtained as a reaction product, the unsta-<br>
ble dibutyltin dialkoxide is deactivated and cannot be<br>
regenerated by a conventional technique. Therefore, in<br>
this method, there is no other choice but to discard<br>
the dibutyltin dialkoxide catalyst (which is expensive)<br>
as a waste after the reaction.<br>
On the other hand, it is known that when a metal<br>
alkoxide (e.g., a dialkyltin dialkoxide) is heated to<br>
about 180 °C, the metal alkoxide suffers thermal dete-<br>
rioration form a trialkyltin alkoxide and the like (see<br><br>
"Kougyoukagakuzasshi (Journal of the Society of Chemi-<br>
cal Industry)", Vol. 72, No. 7, pages 1543 to 1549<br>
(1969)). It is also known that the trialkyltin alkox-<br>
ide formed by the thermal deterioration has a very low<br>
capability of forming a carbonic ester (see "J. Org.<br>
Chem.", Vol. 64, pages 4506 to 4508 (1999)). It is<br>
difficult (or substantially impossible) to regenerate a<br>
dialkyltin dialkoxide having excellent activity from<br>
the trialkyltin alkoxide. Further, the formation of<br>
such degraded compound (i.e., an unregenerable unreac-<br>
tive compound) poses a problem in that, when a metal<br>
alkoxide is reused as a catalyst, the content of an ac-<br>
tive catalyst in the metal alkoxide is decreased and,<br>
hence, the reaction rate and the yield of a carbonic<br>
ester are decreased, rendering a stable production of a<br>
carbonic ester difficult. In such cases, for stabiliz-<br>
ing the reaction rate and the yield of the carbonic es-<br>
ter, a conventional method in which a small amount of a<br>
fresh metal alkoxide is added to the reaction system is<br>
employed. However, this method poses a problem in that,<br>
when the addition of a fresh metal alkoxide is per-<br>
formed while leaving the deterioration product formed<br>
during the reaction as it is in the reaction system,<br>
the deterioration product, which has a low catalyst ac-<br>
tivity, accumulates in a large amount in the reaction<br><br>
system. As apparent also from the above, there is no<br>
conventional method in which a metal alkoxide is effec-<br>
tively reused as a catalyst; in any of the conventional<br>
methods for producing a carbonic ester, there is no<br>
other choice but to discard the metal alkoxide as a<br>
waste after the reaction, thus rendering the production<br>
of a carbonic ester disadvantageously costly.<br>
Thus, in the conventional methods for producing a<br>
carbonic ester by using a metal alkoxide, carbon diox-<br>
ide and an alcohol, when the metal alkoxide (which is<br>
expensive) has lost its catalyst activity due to hy-<br>
drolysis or the like, there is no way to easily and ef-<br>
fectively regenerate and reuse the metal alkoxide.<br>
Therefore, the conventional methods for producing a<br>
carbonic ester is disadvantageous in that it is neces-<br>
sary to use a large amount of an organic dehydrating<br>
agent or a solid dehydrating agent in combination with<br>
a small amount of a metal alkoxide.<br>
As described hereinabove, the prior art techniques<br>
for producing a carbonic ester have many problems and,<br>
therefore, have not been put to practical use.<br>
For solving these problems accompanying the prior<br>
art, the present inventors have proposed in WO03/055840<br>
a novel method for producing a carbonic ester. The es-<br>
sential feature of the novel method resides in that the<br><br>
method uses a reaction route in which an organometal<br>
compound having a metal-oxygen-carbon linkage is used<br>
in a large amount as a precursor of a carbonic ester<br>
but not as a catalyst, and the organometal compound is<br>
subjected to an addition reaction with carbon dioxide<br>
to form an adduct, followed by a thermal decomposition<br>
reaction of the adduct, to thereby obtain a reaction<br>
mixture containing a carbonic ester. The present in-<br>
ventors have found that a carbonic ester can be pro-<br>
duced in high yield by the method. Most of the above-<br>
mentioned problems of the prior art have been solved by<br>
the method. However, even this method still poses a<br>
problem in that an unregenerable unreactive organometal<br>
compound is formed during the reaction and accumulates<br>
in the reaction system.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In this situation, the present inventors have made<br>
further extensive and intensive studies for solving the<br>
above-mentioned problems. In their studies, the pre-<br>
sent inventors have utilized the techniques of their<br>
previous invention disclosed in WO03/055840. As a re-<br>
sult , it has unexpectedly been found that the problems<br>
can be solved by a method for producing a carbonic es-<br>
ter, comprising the steps of: (1) performing a reaction<br><br>
between a first organometal compound mixture and carbon<br>
dioxide, wherein the first organometal compound mixture<br>
comprises a mixture of a reactive organometal compound<br>
having in its molecule at least two metal-oxygen-carbon<br>
linkages and an unregenerable unreactive compound which<br>
is derived from the reactive organometal compound, to<br>
thereby obtain a reaction mixture containing a carbonic<br>
ester formed by the reaction, the unregenerable unreac-<br>
tive compound, and a regenerable metamorphic organome-<br>
tal compound derived from the reactive organometal com-<br>
pound, (2) separating the reaction mixture into a first<br>
portion containing the carbonic ester and the unregen-<br>
erable unreactive compound, and a second portion con-<br>
taining the regenerable metamorphic organometal com-<br>
pound, and (3) reacting the second portion of the reac-<br>
tion mixture with an alcohol to form a second organome-<br>
tal compound mixture and water and removing the water<br>
from the second organometal compound mixture, wherein<br>
the second organometal compound mixture comprises a<br>
mixture of a reactive organometal compound having in<br>
its molecule at least two metal-oxygen-carbon linkages<br>
and an unregenerable unreactive compound which is de-<br>
rived from the reactive organometal compound. The car-<br>
bonic ester can be easily isolated from the first por-<br>
tion of the reaction mixture by a conventional method.<br><br>
such as distillation. The second organometal compound<br>
mixture obtained in step (3) can be recovered and recy-<br>
cled to step (1), wherein the second organometal com-<br>
pound mixture is used in the above-mentioned reaction<br>
for producing a carbonic ester. Based on these find-<br>
ings, the present invention has been completed.<br>
Accordingly, a primary object of the present in-<br>
vention is to provide a method in which a reactive or-<br>
ganometal compound used in the reaction can be reused<br>
without the need for a large amount of a dehydrating<br>
agent and by which commercial production of a carbonic<br>
ester in high yield can be performed continuously and<br>
repeatedly any number of times while removing an unre-<br>
generable unreactive organometal compound from the re-<br>
action system.<br>
The foregoing and other objects, features and ad-<br>
vantages of the present invention will be apparent from<br>
the following detailed description taken in connection<br>
with the accompanying drawings and the appended claims.<br>

Hereinbelow, the present invention is described in<br>
detail.<br>
As described above, the conventional methods (ex-<br>
clusive of the method proposed by the present inventors<br>
in the above-mentioned WO03/055840) for producing a<br>
carbonic ester employs an equilibrium reaction repre-<br>
sented by the following formula (3):<br><br><br>
mentioned WO03/055840), there can be mentioned a method<br>
in which a dehydrating agent is used for a reaction<br>
mixture containing the equilibrium reaction system<br>
(represented by the formula (3) above), wherein the<br>
equilibrium reaction system contains a product system<br>
comprising a carbonic ester and water; and a method in<br>
which a reaction mixture containing the above-mentioned<br>
equilibrium reaction system is cooled and subjected to<br>
a dehydration treatment in which the reaction mixture<br>
is introduced into a packed column containing a solid<br>
dehydrating agent, and circulated through the packed<br>
column, so as to gradually dehydrate the equilibrium<br>
reaction system to thereby suppress a decomposition re-<br>
action of the catalyst and accumulate a carbonic ester<br>
being formed in a trace amount.<br>
On the other hand, the technical concept of the<br>
method of the present invention is completely different<br>
from the technical concept of the conventional methods.<br>
The reaction performed in the method of the pre-<br>
sent invention is basically the same as the reaction<br>
performed in the method proposed by the present inven-<br>
tors in the above-mentioned WO03/055840. Before ex-<br>
plaining the method of the present invention, the es-<br>
sence of the method of the above-mentioned WO03/055840<br>
is briefly explained below.<br><br>
The method of WO03/055840 is characterized in:<br>
that a reaction route is used in which an or-<br>
ganometal compound having a metal-oxygen-carbon linkage<br>
is used in a large amount as a precursor of a carbonic<br>
ester but not as a catalyst, and the organometal com-<br>
pound is subjected to an addition reaction with carbon<br>
dioxide to form an adduct, followed by a thermal decom-<br>
position reaction of the adduct, to thereby obtain a<br>
reaction mixture containing a carbonic ester (step (1)),<br>
that step (1) is followed by an operation in which<br>
the carbonic ester is separated from the reaction mix-<br>
ture to obtain a residual liquid (step (2)), and<br>
that step (2) is followed by a reaction of the re-<br>
sidual liquid with an alcohol to thereby obtain a reac-<br>
tion mixture comprising an organometal compound having<br>
a metal-oxygen-carbon linkage and water, followed by<br>
removal of the water from the reaction mixture by dis-<br>
tillation or the like, to thereby obtain the organome-<br>
tal compound, whereupon the obtained organometal com-<br>
pound is recovered (step (3)),<br>
followed by recycling the organometal compound to<br>
step (1) for producing a carbonic ester.<br>
The reactions in step (1) and step (3) of the<br>
method of WO03/055840 are represented by the below-<br>
mentioned formulae (4) and (5), respectively.<br><br><br>
Thus, the method of WO03/055840 is a method in<br>
which an organometal compound having a metal-oxygen<br>
-carbon linkage is used mainly as a precursor of a car-<br>
bonic ester, and the organometal compound is subjected<br>
to an addition reaction with carbon dioxide to form an<br>
adduct, followed by a thermal decomposition reaction of<br>
the adduct, to thereby obtain a reaction mixture con-<br>
taining a carbonic ester, whereupon the carbonic ester<br>
is separated from the reaction mixture to obtain a re-<br>
sidual liquid (containing a thermal decomposition prod-<br>
uct of the adduct formed by the addition reaction of<br>
the organometal compound having a metal-oxygen-carbon<br>
linkage with carbon dioxide), followed by an operation<br>
in which the residual liquid is reacted with an alcohol<br><br>
to thereby regenerate an organometal compound having a<br>
metal-oxygen-carbon linkage. The regenerated organome-<br>
tal compound is recovered and recycled to the step of<br>
producing a carbonic ester, and the cycle of these<br>
steps is repeated so as to obtain a carbonic ester in a<br>
desired amount.<br>
In step (1) of the method of WO03/055840, at least<br>
a part of the organometal compound having a metal<br>
-oxygen-carbon linkage is converted into a thermal de-<br>
composition product thereof and, hence, the reaction<br>
mixture obtained in step (1) of the method of<br>
WO03/055840 may or may not contain a residual part of<br>
the organometal compound having a metal-oxygen-carbon<br>
linkage used in step (1). Also, after completion of<br>
step (2) of the method of WO03/055840, at least a part<br>
of the organometal compound having a metal-oxygen<br>
-carbon linkage is converted into a thermal decomposi-<br>
tion product or hydrolysis product thereof and, hence,<br>
the residual liquid obtained in step (2) of the method<br>
of WO03/055840 may or may not contain a residual part<br>
of the organometal compound having a metal-oxygen<br>
-carbon linkage used in step (1). Anyway, an organome-<br>
tal compound having a metal-oxygen-carbon linkage is<br>
regenerated (resynthesized) before completion of step<br>
(3) of the method of WO03/055840.<br><br>
In the conventional methods using the equilibrium<br>
reaction of the formula (3) above, the entire reaction<br>
is held under equilibrium. By contrast, in the method<br>
of the previous invention, the equilibrium reaction of<br>
the formula (3) above can be effectively divided into<br>
consecutive reactions which can be easily controlled,<br>
thereby rendering it possible to efficiently produce a<br>
carbonic ester while separating the carbonic ester and<br>
water from the reaction system. Specifically, in step<br>
(1) of the method of WO03/055840, a reaction can be<br>
performed in the absence of water. In step (2) of the<br>
method of WO03/055840, a reverse reaction of a carbonic<br>
ester and other thermal decomposition products can be<br>
prevented by separating a carbonic ester from the reac-<br>
tion mixture. In step (3) of the method of WO03/055840,<br>
after the regeneration of an organometal compound hav-<br>
ing a metal-oxygen-carbon linkage, the organometal com-<br>
pound can be recovered by removing water. Further, in<br>
each step of the method of WO03/055840, the operation<br>
conditions can be easily optimized by appropriately em-<br>
ploying conventional techniques of chemical synthesis,<br>
such as cooling, heating, stirring, pressurizing,<br>
decompression and separation.<br>
As mentioned above, the method of the present in-<br>
vention has been completed as a result of the extensive<br><br>
and intensive studies for improving the above-mentioned<br>
method proposed by the present inventors in WO03/055840.<br>
The method of WO03/055840 poses a problem in that an<br>
unregenerable unreactive organometal compound (i.e., a<br>
degraded compound) formed in the reaction gradually ac-<br>
cumulates in the reaction system. However, this prob-<br>
lem can be easily solved by the method of the present<br>
invention. Generally, an organometal compound is sus-<br>
ceptive to thermal deterioration. Therefore, when an<br>
organometal compound which has been used is recycled,<br>
the reaction system contains a mixture of an active or-<br>
ganometal compound and an organometal compound having<br>
an extremely low activity (i.e., unregenerable unreac-<br>
tive organometal compound, which is a degraded com-<br>
pound), wherein the ratio of the unregenerable unreac-<br>
tive organometal compound to the active organometal<br>
compound gradually becomes large. Therefore, for a<br>
stable production of a carbonic ester, it is necessary<br>
to continuously feed a fresh, active organometal com-<br>
pound or a raw material thereof during the reaction.<br>
In the field of the production of a carbonic ester from<br>
carbon dioxide and an alcohol, it is difficult to sepa-<br>
rate a degraded compound (derived from the organometal<br>
compound) formed during the reaction. Although some<br>
prior art documents concerning such method describe the<br><br>
recycle of the organometal compound, there has been no<br>
conventional technique for removing the degraded com-<br>
pound (derived from the organometal compound) from the<br>
reaction system. On the other hand, in the field of<br>
the production of a carbonic ester in the presence of a<br>
conventional catalyst, a method has been practiced in<br>
which a part of the catalyst having been used for the<br>
reaction for producing a carbonic ester is taken out<br>
from the reaction system and a fresh catalyst is fed in<br>
an amount which corresponds to the amount of the cata-<br>
lyst having lost its catalyst activity. However, this<br>
method poses a problem in that, for taking out the de-<br>
activated catalyst, it is necessary to take out a part<br>
of the active catalyst in an amount which is several<br>
times or dozens of times the amount of the deactivated<br>
catalyst. Therefore, when a reaction is performed by<br>
using this method in the presence of an expensive cata-<br>
lyst, the production cost becomes very high. Thus, it<br>
is virtually impossible to practice this method on a<br>
commercial scale. Accordingly, in this conventional<br>
method, when a catalyst is recycled, it is important to<br>
selectively remove the degraded compound from the reac-<br>
tion system. As a result of their extensive and inten-<br>
sive studies, the present inventors have found that the<br>
degraded compound has physical properties (such as the<br><br>
boiling point and the physical state, e.g., the solid<br>
form or the liquid form) and chemical properties (such<br>
as hydrolyzability) which are different from those of<br>
the useful organometal compounds (i.e., a reactive or-<br>
ganometal compound and a regenerable metamorphic or-<br>
ganometal compound). Based on this finding, the pre-<br>
sent inventors have completed the present invention,<br>
which is directed to a method in which an organometal<br>
compound can be repeatedly used while selectively with-<br>
drawing at least a part of a degraded compound derived<br>
from the reactive organometal compound.<br>
The method of the present invention is a method<br>
for producing a carbonic ester, comprising the step of:<br>
(1) performing a reaction between a first or-<br>
ganometal compound mixture and carbon dioxide, the<br>
first organometal compound mixture comprising a mixture<br>
of a reactive organometal compound having in its mole-<br>
cule at least two metal-oxygen-carbon linkages and an<br>
unregenerable unreactive compound which is derived from<br>
the reactive organometal compound and which has in its<br>
molecule at least three metal-carbon linkages,<br>
to thereby obtain a reaction mixture containing a<br>
carbonic ester formed by the reaction, the unregener-<br>
able unreactive compound, and a regenerable metamorphic<br>
organometal compound derived from the reactive or-<br><br>
ganometal compound,<br>
(2)	separating the reaction mixture into a first<br>
portion containing the carbonic ester and the unregen-<br>
erable unreactive compound, and a second portion con-<br>
taining the regenerable metamorphic organometal com-<br>
pound, and<br>
(3)	reacting the second portion of the reaction<br>
mixture with a first alcohol to form a second organome-<br>
tal compound mixture and water and removing the water<br>
from the second organometal compound mixture, the<br>
second organometal compound mixture comprising a<br>
mixture of a reactive organometal compound having in<br>
its molecule at least two metal-oxygen-carbon linkages<br>
and an unregenerable unreactive compound which is<br>
derived from the reactive organometal compound and<br>
which has in its molecule at least three metal-carbon<br>
linkaheeinbelow, an explanation is given with respect<br>
to the compounds used in the method of the present in-<br>
vention.<br>
In step (1) of the method of the present invention,<br>
a reactive organometal compound having a metal-oxygen<br>
-carbon linkage is used. The reactive organometal com-<br>
pound used in step (1) of the method of the present in-<br>
vention has in its molecule at least two metal-oxygen<br>

The Periodic Table mentioned herein is as pre-<br>
scribed in the IUPAC (International Union of Pure and<br>
Applied Chemistry) nomenclature system (1989).<br>
In the method of the present invention, the above-<br>
mentioned organometal compound is used in at least one<br>
form selected from the group consisting of a monomeric<br>
form, an oligomeric form, a polymeric form and an asso-<br>
ciated form.<br>
Each of M in the organometal compound represented<br>
2 3<br>
by formula (1) above and M and M in the organometal<br>
compound represented by formula (2) above independently<br>
represents a metal atom selected from the group con-<br>
sisting of elements belonging to Groups 4 and 14 of the<br>
Periodic Table, exclusive of silicon. It is preferred<br>
12 3<br>
that each of M , M and M is a metal atom selected<br>
from the group consisting of a titanium atom, a tin<br>
atom and a zirconium atom. From the viewpoint of the<br>
solubility in and reactivity with an alcohol, it is<br>
12 3<br>
more preferred that each of M , M and M is a tin atom.<br>
Examples of R and R in the organometal compound<br>
S (\	7	ft<br>
represented by formula (1) above and R , R , R and R<br>
in the organometal compound represented by formula (2)<br>
above include C1-C12 alkyl groups (which are aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbon groups) and C5-C12 cycloalkyl groups (which<br>
are alicyclic hydrocarbon groups), such as a methyl<br><br>
group, an ethyl group, a propyl group, an n-butyl group<br>
(and isomers thereof), a butyl group (and isomers<br>
thereof), a pentyl group (and isomers thereof), a hexyl<br>
group (and isomers thereof), a heptyl group (and iso-<br>
mers thereof), an octyl group (and isomers thereof), a<br>
nonyl group (and isomers thereof), a decyl group (and<br>
isomers thereof), an undecyl group (and isomers<br>
thereof), a dodecyl group (and isomers thereof), a 2-<br>
butenyl group, a cyclobutenyl group, a cyclobutyl group,<br>
a cyclopentyl group, a cyclohexyl group, a cyclopenta-<br>
dienyl group and a cyclohexenyl group; C7-C20 aralkyl<br>
groups, such as a benzyl group and a phenylethyl group;<br>
and C5-C20 aryl groups, such as a phenyl group, a tolyl<br>
group and a naphthyl group. Each of these hydrocarbon<br>
groups may have an ether linkage. Moreover, each of<br>
these hydrocarbon groups may be a halogenated hydrocar-<br>
bon group (i.e., hydrocarbon group which has at least<br>
one hydrogen atom thereof replaced by a halogen atom),<br>
such as a nonafluorobutyl group or a heptafluorobutyl<br>
group (and isomers thereof). However, R1, R2, R5, R6,<br>
R7 and R8 are not limited to these examples. Of the<br>
above-mentioned groups, lower alkyl groups are pre-<br>
ferred, and straight chain or branched C1-C4 alkyl<br>
groups are more preferred. Hydrocarbon groups having<br>
more carbon atoms than mentioned above can also be used<br><br>
as R1, R2, R5, R6. R7 and R8; however, when such groups<br>
having a larger number of carbon atoms are used, there<br>
is a danger that the fluidity of the organometal com-<br>
pound and/or the productivity of a carbonic ester be-<br>
comes low. Examples of R3 and R4 in the organometal<br>
compound represented by formula (1) above and R9 and<br>
R10 in the organometal compound represented by formula<br>
(2) above include C1-C12 alkyl groups (which are ali-<br>
phatic hydrocarbon groups) and C5-C12 cycloalkyl groups<br>
(which are alicyclic hydrocarbon groups), such as a<br>
methyl group, an ethyl group, a propyl group (and iso-<br>
mers thereof), a butyl group (and isomers thereof), a<br>
2-butenyl group, a pentyl group (and isomers thereof),<br>
a hexyl group (and isomers thereof), an octyl group<br>
(and isomers thereof), a nonyl group (and isomers<br>
thereof), a decyl group (and isomers thereof), an unde-<br>
cyl group (and isomers thereof), a dodecyl group (and<br>
isomers thereof), a cyclopropyl group, a cyclobutyl<br>
group, a cyclopentyl group, a cyclopentadienyl group, a<br>
cyclohexyl group, a cyclohexenyl group, a methoxyethyl<br>
group, an ethoxymethyl group and an ethoxyethyl group;<br>
and C7-C20 aralkyl groups, such as a benzyl group and a<br>
phenylethyl group. However, R3, R4 , R9 and R10 are not<br>
limited to these examples. Of the above-mentioned<br>
groups, preferred are organometal compounds in which<br><br>
each of the corresponding alcohols (i.e., R3 OH, R4 OH,<br>
R9 OH and R10 OH) has a boiling point higher than that of<br>
water (wherein the boiling point is measured under at-<br>
mospheric pressure). Further, from the viewpoint of<br>
recycling the organometal compound regenerated in step<br>
(3), it is most preferred that, in the organometal com-<br>
pound represented by formula (1) and/or formula (2)<br>
above, the alkyl or alkenyl moiety of each of the<br>
alkoxy group is n-butyl, isobutyl, a straight chain or<br>
branched C5-C12 alkyl or a straight chain or branched<br>
C4-C12 alkenyl.<br>

The above-mentioned reactive organometal compounds<br><br>
may be used individually or in combination. Further,<br>
orgnometal compounds other than mentioned above or in-<br>
organic metal compounds may be used in combination with<br>
the above-mentioned reactive organometal compounds. As<br>
a reactive organometal compound, those reactive or-<br>
ganometal compounds which are commercially available<br>
may be used. Alternatively, reactive organometal com-<br>
pounds represented by formula (1) above may be obtained<br>
by a conventional method (e.g., a method described in<br>
Dutch Patent No. 6612421) in which dibutyltin oxide, an<br>
alcohol having 4 or more carbon atoms and a solvent ex-<br>
hibiting an azeotropy with water are mixed together to<br>
effect a reaction, and the resultant is subjected to<br>
distillation, thereby obtaining a fraction containing a<br>
reactive organometal compound represented by formula<br>
(1) above. The above-mentioned Dutch Patent No.<br>
6612421 describes that this method cannot be employed<br>
for obtaining an organometal compound having a C1-C3<br>
alkoxy group and that an organometal compound having a<br>
C1-C3 alkoxy group can be obtained from dibutyltin di-<br>
chloride and sodium alcoholate. On the other hand, by<br>
employing a method described in Japanese Patent Appli-<br>
cation No. 2001-396537 or Japanese Patent Application<br>
No. 2001-396545, there can be obtained an organometal<br>
compound represented by formula (1) or (2) from a metal<br><br>
oxide and an alcohol. By this method, there can be ob-<br>
tained an organometal compound having a C1-C3 alkoxy<br>
group, such as a methoxy group. For example, an or-<br>
ganometal compound having a methoxy group can be ob-<br>
tained from dibutyltin oxide, methanol and hexane. It<br>
is known that, in such a case, methanol and hexane form<br>
a minimum boiling azeotrope. However, the present in-<br>
ventors have unexpectedly found that, by this method,<br>
the removal of water can be performed, even though the<br>
methanol/hexane mixture has a boiling point lower than<br>
that of water. Based on this finding, the present in-<br>
ventors have developed a method for producing an or-<br>
ganometal compound from an alcohol having a boiling<br>
point lower than that of water. An organometal com-<br>
pound obtained from dibutyltin oxide and an alcohol<br>
having a boiling point lower than that of water tends<br>
to be comprised mainly of an organometal compound rep-<br>
resented by formula (2). However, when it is desired<br>
to obtain a large amount of an organometal compound<br>
represented by formula (1), it can be achieved by sub-<br>
jecting the above-mentioned organometal compound com-<br>
prised mainly of an organometal compound represented by<br>
formula (2) to distillation, thereby obtaining a frac-<br>
tion comprising an organometal compound represented by<br>
formula (1). Alternatively, an organometal compound<br><br>
represented by formula (1) can be obtained by perform-<br>
ing a reaction of dialkyltin dichloride and an alcoho-<br>
late.<br>
In the present invention, in connection with the<br>
above-mentioned reactive organometal compound, the term<br>
"regenerable metamorphic organometal compound derived<br>
from the reactive organometal compound" and the term<br>
"unregenerable unreactive (organometal) compound de-<br>
rived from the reactive organometal compound" are used.<br>
With respect to these terms, explanations are given be-<br>
low. The reactive organometal compound used in the<br>
present invention is an organometal compound having in<br>
its molecule at least two metal-oxygen-carbon linkages.<br>
In the present invention, the term "regenerable meta-<br>
morphic organometal compound derived from the reactive<br>
organometal compound" is used to indicate compounds<br>
which are comprised mainly of the decomposition prod-<br>
ucts formed by the thermal decomposition of the above<br>
-mentioned adduct (CO2 adduct) formed by the reaction<br>
of the reactive organometal compound with carbon diox-<br>
ide, wherein the thermal decomposition products are<br>
formed simultaneously with the formation of the car-<br>
bonic ester. It is difficult to specify the detailed<br>
structure of the regenerable metamorphic organometal<br>
compound. However, as regenerable metamorphic or-<br><br>
ganometal compounds, there can be also mentioned a hy-<br>
drolysis product of the reactive organometal compound<br>
and a hydrolysis product of the carbon dioxide adduct<br>
of the reactive organometal compound.<br>
On the other hand, the term "unregenerable unreac-<br>
tive (organometal) compound derived from the reactive<br>
organometal compound" (or simply "degraded compound")<br>
is used to indicate compounds which are unregenerable<br>
organometal compounds (formed by a thermal degradation<br>
of the reactive organometal compound and/or the carbon<br>
dioxide adduct thereof) having an extremely low activ-<br>
ity. A degraded compound (i.e.. unregenerable unreac-<br>
tive compound) is formed mainly in step (3). However,<br>
a degraded compound is sometimes formed in a step for<br>
producing the reactive organometal compound. As a rep-<br>
resentative example of the degraded compound, there can<br>
be mentioned a compound having, per metal atom in a<br>
molecule thereof, at least three metal-carbon linkages.<br>
As an example of such a compound, there can be men-<br>
tioned a compound represented by the following formula<br>
(6):<br><br><br>
wherein:<br>
M represents a metal atom selected from<br>
the group consisting of elements belonging<br>
to Groups 4 and 14 of the Periodic Table,<br>
exclusive of silicon;<br>
each of R11 , R12 and R13 independently<br>
represents a straight chain or branched C1-<br>
C12 alkyl group, a C5-C12 cycloalkyl group,<br>
a straight chain or branched C2-C12 alkenyl<br>
group, a C7-C20 aralkyl group comprised of<br>
unsubstituted or substituted C6-C19 aryl and<br>
alkyl selected from the group consisting of<br>
straight chain or branched C1-C14 alkyl and<br>
C5-C14 cycloalkyl, or an unsubstituted or<br>
substituted C6-C20 aryl group;<br>
R14 represents a straight chain or<br>
branched C1-C12 alkyl group, a C5-C12<br>
cycloalkyl group, a straight chain or<br><br>
branched C2-C12 alkenyl group, or a C7-C2o<br>
aralkyl group comprised of unsubstituted or<br>
substituted C6-C19 aryl and alkyl selected<br>
from the group consisting of straight chain<br>
or branched C1-C14 alkyl and C5-C14 cycloal-<br>
kyl; and<br>
each of k, 1 and m is an integer of from<br>
0 to 4, k+1+m=3 or 4, nisan integer<br>
of 0 or 1, and k+1+m+n=4.<br>
Specific examples of degraded compounds of formula<br>
(6) above include tetraalkyltin and trialkyltin alkox-<br>
ide. Further examples of degraded compounds (unreac-<br>
tive compounds) include metal oxides, such as SnO2,<br>
TiO2 and ZrO2.<br>
The degraded compound (such as the above-mentioned<br>
compound having, per metal atom in a molecule thereof,<br>
at least three metal-carbon linkages) has physical and<br>
chemical properties different from those of the useful<br>
organometal compound (i.e., the reactive organometal<br>
compound or the regenerable metamorphic organometal<br>
compound). Specifically, the degraded compound is dif-<br>
ferent from the useful organometal compound mainly in<br>
that the degraded compound has a boiling point lower<br>
than that of the useful organometal compound and is<br><br>
less susceptible to hydrolysis than the useful or-<br>
ganometal compound.<br>
Hereinbelow, explanations are given with respect<br>
to the alcohols used in the method of the present in-<br>
vention.<br>
In the method of the present invention, a first<br>
alcohol is used in step (3). In addition, a second al-<br>
cohol may be optionally used in step (1). Further, an<br>
alcohol may be optionally used in step (2) (hereinafter,<br>
this alcohol is frequently referred to as a "third al-<br>
cohol" ) .<br>
The first, second and third alcohols may be the<br>
same or different from one another. Examples of such<br>
alcohols include alkyl alcohols having a straight chain<br>
or branched C1-C12 alkyl group, cycloalkyl alcohols<br>
having a C5-C12 cycloalkyl group, alkenyl alcohols hav-<br>
ing a straight chain or branched C2-C12 alkenyl group,<br>
and aralkyl alcohols having a C7-C20 aralkyl group com-<br>
prised of unsubstituted or substituted C5-C19 aryl and<br>
alkyl selected from the group consisting of straight<br>
chain or branched C1-C14 alkyl and C5-C14 cycloalkyl.<br>
Specific examples of these alcohols include C1-C12<br>
aliphatic alcohols and C5-C12 alicyclic alcohols, such<br>
as methanol, ethanol, propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol,<br><br>
2-butanol (and isomers thereof), 2-methyl-1-propanol,<br>
2-methyl-2-propanol, cyclobutanol, 1-pentanol, 2<br>
-pentanol (and isomers thereof), 3-pentanol, 3-methyl<br>
-1-butanol, 2-methyl-l-butanol, 2-methyl-2-butanol (and<br>
isomers thereof), 3-methyl-2-butanol (and isomers<br>
thereof), cyclopentanol, 2-methyl-l-cyclobutanol (and<br>

thereof), 1-methyl-1-cyclobutanol (and isomers thereof),<br>

alkyl alcohols having a straight chain or branched C5-<br>
Cg alkyl group.<br>
Hereinbelow, explanations are given on the method<br>
for analyses of the reactive organometal compound and<br>
the degraded compound derived therefrom.<br>
The reactive organometal compounds which are, re-<br>
spectively, represented by formulae (1) and (2), and<br>
the degraded compound (the unregenerable unreactive<br>
compound) can be analyzed by, for example, the Sn-119<br>
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (119Sn-NMR) spectroscopy (see.<br><br>
for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,545,600). However, in a<br>
119Sn-NMR spectrum, a chemical shift value ascribed to<br>
the structure of the organometal compound represented<br>
by formula (1) largely varies depending, for example,<br>
on the organometal compound content of the sample used<br>
for the 119Sn-NMR analysis and on the presence or ab-<br>
sence of an alcohol in the sample used for the 119Sn-NMR<br>
analysis. Therefore, it is preferred that the analysis<br>
of the organometal compound is performed by a method in<br>
which the proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR)<br>
spectroscopy and the carbon-13 nuclear magnetic reso-<br>
nance (13C-NMR) spectroscopy are used in combination<br>
with the 119Sn-NMR spectroscopy. Table 1 below shows<br>
119Sn-NMR data of examples of chemical shift values as-<br>
cribed to the structure of a reactive orgnometal com-<br>
pound represented by formula (1), which is produced<br>
from 2-ethyl-1-hexanol and dibutyltin oxide. Table 2<br>
below shows 119Sn-NMR data of examples of chemical shift<br>
values ascribed to the structure of a degraded compound<br>
(i.e., unregenerable unreactive organometal compound)<br>
represented by formula (6). In the 119Sn-NMR chart of<br>
the degraded compound, the chemical shift value as-<br>
cribed to the structure of the degraded compound does<br>
not depend very much on the degraded compound content<br>
of the sample used for the 119Sn-NMR analysis, but<br><br>
mainly on the types of alkyl groups and alkoxy group<br>
contained in the degraded compound. The characteristic<br>
feature of the 119Sn-NMR chart of the degraded compound<br>
resides in that signals ascribed to the structure of<br>
the degraded compound appear in the range of from 6 90<br>
to 110 ppm.<br><br><br><br><br>
With respect to each step of the method of the<br>
present invention, detailed explanations are given be-<br>
low.<br>
In step (1) of the method of the present invention,<br>
a reaction is performed between a first organometal<br>
compound mixture and carbon dioxide, wherein the first<br>
organometal compound mixture comprises a mixture of a<br>
reactive organometal compound having in its molecule at<br>
least two metal-oxygen-carbon linkages and an unregen-<br>
erable unreactive compound which is derived from the<br>
reactive organometal compound and which has in its<br>
molecule at least three metal-carbon linkages, to<br>
thereby obtain a reaction mixture containing a carbonic<br>
ester formed by the reaction, the unregenerable unreac-<br>
tive compound, and a regenerable metamorphic organome-<br>
tal compound derived from the reactive organometal com-<br>
pound. Step (1) of the method of the present invention<br>
involves a reaction route in which a carbon dioxide ad-<br>
duct of a reactive organometal compound having in its<br>
molecule at least two metal-oxygen-carbon linkages is<br>
formed, and the adduct formed is thermally decomposed<br>
to obtain a carbonic ester. That is, in the reaction<br>
route of step (1), carbon dioxide is addition-bonded to<br>
a reactive organometal compound to form an adduct, and<br>
the adduct is thermally decomposed. Differing from the<br><br>
conventional methods, step (1) of the method of the<br>
present invention is characterized in that an organome-<br>
tal compound having in its molecule at least two metal<br>
-oxygen-carbon linkages is reacted with a small<br>
stoichiometric amount of carbon dioxide. In the con-<br>
ventional methods, carbon dioxide under a high pressure<br>
is reacted with an alcohol in the presence of a small<br>
amount of a metal catalyst. As an example of such con-<br>
ventional method, there can be mentioned a method in<br>
which carbon dioxide is reacted with methanol in the<br>
presence of dibutyltin dimethoxide (see Polyhedron, Vol.<br>
19, pages 573-576 (2000)). In the conventional method<br>
described in this literature, carbon dioxide under a<br>
pressure of about 30 MPa is reacted with methanol at<br>
180 °C in the presence of several millimoles of dibu-<br>
tyltin dimethoxide. The exact amount of carbon dioxide<br>
used in the reaction is not described in the above-<br>
mentioned literature. However, it is considered that,<br>
even if the partial pressure of methanol is subtracted,<br>
the amount of carbon dioxide used in the reaction<br>
should be as large as at least 100 times the<br>
stoichiometric amount relative to the amount of the or-<br>
ganometal compound having a metal-oxygen-carbon linkage.<br>
By achieving the above-mentioned high pressure condi-<br>
tions, the equilibrium is forcibly displaced toward a<br><br>
carbonic ester, so that a carbonic ester can be pro-<br>
duced in a yield which is higher than expected from the<br>
amount of the catalyst. However, by the reaction of<br>
carbon dioxide with methanol, free water is also pro-<br>
duced, thus posing a serious problem in that the cata-<br>
lyst is hydrolyzed by the free water. For solving this<br>
problem, it is necessary to develop a method for dehy-<br>
drating the reaction system. In the above-mentioned<br>
literature, it is described that, under the above<br>
-mentioned reaction conditions, dibutyltin oxide is<br>
produced as a hydrolysis product of dibutyltin dimeth-<br>
oxide and remains in the reaction system. Dibutyltin<br>
oxide cannot be dissolved in a solvent at room tempera-<br>
ture; however, in the method of the present invention,<br>
even when the reaction mixture after completion of step<br>
(1) is cooled to room temperature, the reaction mixture<br>
generally remains in the form of a liquid. In this re-<br>
spect, the reaction used in the method of the present<br>
invention differs from the reaction used in the above<br>
-mentioned conventional method in which a large amount<br>
of carbon dioxide is used.<br>
In the case of the conventional method, the reac-<br>
tion system has a high carbon dioxide concentration and,<br>
hence, the reaction is necessarily performed under high<br>
pressure conditions. Therefore, when the reaction mix-<br><br>
ture containing the produced carbonic ester is taken<br>
out from the reactor, it is necessary to purge a large<br>
amount of carbon dioxide from the reactor before taking<br>
out the reaction mixture. Such necessity poses prob-<br>
lems not only in that a large amount of carbon dioxide<br>
is wasted, but also in that, if it is intended to reuse<br>
the purged carbon dioxide, repressurization of the car-<br>
bon dioxide becomes necessary and, hence, a large<br>
amount of energy is consumed for the repressurization<br>
of the carbon dioxide. Further, in the conventional<br>
method, the following problem is also likely to occur.<br>
It is known that, when the reaction system has a high<br>
carbon dioxide concentration, the density of the carbon<br>
dioxide gas layer increases, so that the carbon dioxide<br>
dissolves not only a solvent and a catalyst but also<br>
the produced carbonic ester, thereby forming a reaction<br>
mixture comprised of a homogeneous mixture of carbon<br>
dioxide, the solvent, the catalyst and the produced<br>
carbonic ester. When the reaction mixture (homogeneous<br>
mixture) is cooled to obtain a liquid reaction mixture,<br>
the liquid reaction mixture contains carbon dioxide in<br>
the form of liquid carbonic acid. Thus, it is ex-<br>
tremely difficult to separate the produced carbonic es-<br>
ter from the reaction mixture.<br>
In step (1) of the method of the present invention.<br><br>
it is preferred that carbon dioxide is used in an<br>
amount which is 1 to 50 times, more advantageously 1 to<br>
20 times, as large as the stoichiometric amount rela-<br>
tive to the amount of the reactive organometal compound<br>
having in its molecule at least two metal-oxygen-carbon<br>
linkages. When the amount of carbon dioxide is large,<br>
the reaction becomes a high pressure reaction, so that<br>
not only does it become necessary to use a reactor hav-<br>
ing high pressure resistance, but also a large amount<br>
of carbon dioxide is wasted during purging of unreacted<br>
carbon dioxide after completion of step (1). Therefore,<br>
it is still more preferred that carbon dioxide is used<br>
in an amount which is 1 to 10 times as large as the<br>
stoichiometric amount relative to the amount of the re-<br>
active organometal compound. In other words, in step<br>
(1), it is preferred that the reactive organometal com-<br>
pound is used in an amount which is 1/50 to 1 time,<br>
more advantageously 1/20 to 1 time, as large as the<br>
stoichiometric amount relative to the amount of carbon<br>
dioxide. In the present invention, a carbon dioxide<br>
adduct of the reactive organometal compound having in<br>
its molecule at least two metal-oxygen-carbon linkages<br>
can be easily obtained by contacting the reactive or-<br>
ganometal compound with carbon dioxide. When the reac-<br>
tion temperature is room temperature (20 °C), the car-<br><br>
bon dioxide adduct is exothermically produced by con-<br>
tacting the reactive organometal compound with a stream<br>
of carbon dioxide having atmospheric pressure. In this<br>
case, the carbon dioxide adduct can be obtained in a<br>
yield of almost 100 %. In accordance with the eleva-<br>
tion of the reaction temperature, the amount of the<br>
carbon dioxide adduct produced becomes lowered; however,<br>
even when the reaction temperature is high, the lower-<br>
ing of the amount of the carbon dioxide adduct can be<br>
suppressed by contacting the reactive organometal com-<br>
pound with carbon dioxide having a high pressure. In<br>
step (1), when the reactive organometal compound is<br>
contacted with carbon dioxide having a high pressure,<br>
it is difficult to determine the amount of the carbon<br>
dioxide adduct produced; however, it is preferred that<br>
the reaction of the reactive organometal compound with<br>
carbon dioxide is performed under a desired pressure,<br>
depending on the rate at which the carbonic ester is<br>
produced and on the amount of the carbonic ester pro-<br>
duced. The reaction pressure is generally from atmos-<br>
pheric pressure to 200 MPa. It is preferred that the<br>
amount of the carbonic ester obtained in step (1) is<br>
100 % or less, more advantageously 50 % or less, based<br>
on the stoichiometric amount relative to the amount of<br>
the reactive organometal compound. The reason for this<br><br>
is as follows. The reactive organometal compound used<br>
in the method of the present invention is more suscep-<br>
tible to hydrolysis than the carbonic ester produced.<br>
Therefore, when the carbonic ester is obtained in an<br>
amount which is 100 % or less, preferably 50 % or less,<br>
based on the stoichiometric amount relative to the<br>
amount of the reactive organometal compound, water<br>
which is likely to hydrolyze the produced carbonic es-<br>
ter does advantageously not occur in the reaction mix-<br>
ture. On the other hand, in the case of the conven-<br>
tional methods, the reaction is performed so that the<br>
amount of the carbonic ester produced is more than<br>
100 %, based on the stoichiometric amount relative to<br>
the amount of the reactive organometal compound. As a<br>
result, in the case of the conventional methods, the<br>
generation of free water which is likely to hydrolyze<br>
the produced carbonic ester poses a serious problem.<br>
For preventing the produced carbonic ester from being<br>
hydrolyzed, it is necessary to add a dehydrating agent<br>
to the reaction system or to perform the reaction in<br>
the presence of a dehydrating agent, wherein the dehy-<br>
drating agent is selected from the group consisting of<br>
a dehydrating agent which is more susceptible to hy-<br>
drolysis than the reactive organometal compound, and a<br>
solid dehydrating agent having high water adsorptivity.<br><br>
Such use of a dehydrating agent is disadvantageous not<br>
only in that a complicated step is needed, but also in<br>
that the dehydrating agent is expensive. Therefore,<br>
the conventional methods have not been practically em-<br>
ployed as a method for producing a carbonic ester on a<br>
commercial scale. By contrast, in the reaction route<br>
of step (1) of the method of the present invention, the<br>
main reaction is a decomposition reaction in which a<br>
carbon dioxide adduct of the reactive organometal com-<br>
pound having in its molecule at least two metal-oxygen<br>
-carbon linkages is thermally decomposed to obtain a<br>
carbonic ester. The thermal decomposition reaction is<br>
performed at a temperature in the range of from 20 to<br>
300 °C. In step (1) of the method of the present in-<br>
vention, an alcohol exchange reaction or an ester ex-<br>
change reaction may be performed together with the<br>
above-mentioned decomposition reaction. Specifically,<br>
for example, when step (1) is performed in the presence<br>
of a second alcohol, an alcohol exchange reaction oc-<br>
curs between an oxygen-carbon linkage of the second al-<br>
cohol and an oxygen-carbon linkage of the reactive or-<br>
ganometal compound having in its molecule at least two<br>
metal-oxygen-carbon linkages, so that a carbonic ester<br>
corresponding to the second alcohol can be obtained.<br>
Alternatively, after the formation of a carbonic ester.<br><br>
a second alcohol may be added to the reaction system to<br>
perform an ester exchange reaction, thereby obtaining<br>
another carbonic ester corresponding to the second al-<br>
cohol .<br>
With respect to step (1), more detailed explana-<br>
tions are given below.<br>
The studies by the present inventors have shown<br>
that, in step (1), a carbonic ester is obtained by the<br>
reaction between the reactive organometal compound and<br>
carbon dioxide. Therefore, the use of a second alcohol<br>
in step (1) is optional. However, from the viewpoint<br>
of producing a carbonic ester in high yield, it is pre-<br>
ferred to use a second alcohol in step (1). The reason<br>
for this is as follows. The thermal decomposition re-<br>
action in step (1) has a reverse reaction. When a sec-<br>
ond alcohol is added to the reaction system, it is pos-<br>
sible that another equilibrium reaction additionally<br>
occurs between the second alcohol and a thermal decom-<br>
position product other than the carbonic ester, thereby<br>
improving the yield of the carbonic ester. The addi-<br>
tion of a second alcohol for improving the yield of the<br>
carbonic ester is especially effective when the reac-<br>
tive organometal compound is comprised mainly of an or-<br>
ganometal compound represented by formula (2). On the<br>
other hand, when the reactive organometal compound is<br><br>
comprised mainly of an organometal compound represented<br>
by formula (1), the equilibrium of the thermal decompo-<br>
sition reaction in step (1) is biased toward the prod-<br>
uct system and, hence, the yield of the carbonic ester<br>
is considerably high, so that, in some cases, the yield<br>
of the carbonic ester cannot be further improved by the<br>
addition of a second alcohol. When the second alcohol<br>
contains a large amount of water, the yield of the car-<br>
bonic ester is lowered. Therefore, it is preferred<br>
that the amount of water contained in the second alco-<br>
hol is not more than 0.1 times, more advantageously not<br>
more than 0.01 times, as large as the stoichiometric<br>
amount relative to the amount of the reactive organome-<br>
tal compound. When the reaction in step (1) is per-<br>
formed using an organometal compound represented by<br>
formula (1), a carbon dioxide adduct of the organometal<br>
compound represented by formula (1) is thermally decom-<br>
posed to produce a carbonic ester. It is well known<br>
that a carbonic ester is produced from a dimer of the<br>
organometal compound represented by formula (1) (see<br>
ECO INDUSTRY, Vol. 6, No. 6, pages 11-18 (2001)). In<br>
the conventional method described in this literature, a<br>
carbonic ester as well as dibutyltin oxide is produced<br>
from a dimer of the organometal compound represented by<br>
formula (1), wherein the amount of the carbonic ester<br><br>
produced is two molecules per molecule of the dimer of<br>
the organometal compound. The present inventors have<br>
made extensive and intensive studies on the formation<br>
of a carbonic ester from an organometal compound. As a<br>
result, it has surprisingly been found that, when a<br>
carbon dioxide adduct of a dimer of the organometal<br>
compound represented by formula (1) is thermally decom-<br>
posed, a carbonic ester is swiftly eliminated wherein<br>
the amount of the carbonic ester eliminated is one<br>
molecule per molecule of the carbon dioxide adduct, so<br>
that an organometal compound represented by formula (2)<br>
and/or a carbon dioxide adduct thereof can be obtained.<br>
In this case, addition of an alcohol is not necessary.<br>
Step (2) may be performed immediately after there are<br>
obtained a carbonic ester and at least one compound se-<br>
lected from the group consisting of an organometal com-<br>
pound represented by formula (2) and a carbon dioxide<br>
adduct thereof. Alternatively, step (2) may be per-<br>
formed after a carbonic ester is further produced from<br>
the obtained organometal compound represented by for-<br>
mula (2) and/or the obtained carbon dioxide adduct<br>
thereof. As mentioned above, it is preferred that the<br>
reactive organometal compound used in step (1) com-<br>
prises at least one compound selected from the group<br>
consisting of organometal compounds respectively repre-<br><br>
sented by formulae (1) and (2). It is more preferred<br>
that at least a part of the reactive organometal com-<br>
pound used in step (1) is an organometal compound rep-<br>
resented by formula (1). It is still more preferred<br>
that the reactive organometal compound used in step (1)<br>
contains 5 mol % or more of an organometal compound<br>
represented by formula (1), wherein the amount of the<br>
organometal compound is expressed in terms of the<br>
amount of a metal atom contained in the organometal<br>
compound.<br>
A solvent for the reactive organometal compound<br>
may be used in step (1). The reactive organometal com-<br>
pound used in the present invention is generally in the<br>
form of a liquid. However, in some cases, the reactive<br>
organometal compound is in the form of a solid. Fur-<br>
ther, there is a case where the reactive organometal<br>
compound turns into a solid form when the reactive or-<br>
ganometal compound becomes a carbon dioxide adduct<br>
thereof in step (1). Even when the reactive organome-<br>
tal compound is in the form of a solid, a carbonic es-<br>
ter can be produced in step (1). However, the fluidity<br>
of the reactive organometal compound is sometimes im-<br>
portant when the carbonic ester is continuously pro-<br>
duced. Further, for improving the rate of the reaction<br>
between the reactive organometal compound and carbon<br><br>
dioxide, it is sometimes preferred that the reactive<br>
organometal compound is in the form of a liquid. In<br>
such cases, step (1) may be performed using a solvent<br>
for the reactive organometal compound. As a solvent,<br>
there can be used an alcohol having the same organic<br>
group as in the carbonic ester produced. Alternatively,<br>
an inert solvent can also be used. Examples of inert<br>
solvents include hydrocarbons and ethers. Specific ex-<br>
amples of inert solvents include C5-C20 saturated hydro-<br>
carbons, such as pentane, hexane, cyclohexane, heptane,<br>
octane and decane; C6-C20 aromatic hydrocarbons (which<br>
may have a C1-C14 saturated alkyl group and/or a C5-C14<br>
cycloalkyl group), such as benzene, toluene, xylene and<br>
ethylbenzene; C6-C20 saturated alkyl ethers, such as<br>
dipropyl ether, dibutyl ether and dihexyl ether; C4-C20<br>
cycloalkyl ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxane;<br>
and C7-C28 phenyl ethers (comprising a phenyl group hav-<br>
ing a C0-C8 substituent group, and a group selected from<br>
the group consisting of a C1-C14 alkyl group and a C5-C14<br>
cycloalkyl group), such as anisole, ethyl phenyl ether,<br>
isopropyl phenyl ether, benzyl methyl ether and 4<br>
-methyl anisole.<br>
The temperature employed for the reaction per-<br>
formed in step (1) is generally in the range of from<br>
room temperature (20 °C) to 300°C. When it is intended<br><br>
to complete the reaction in a short period of time, it<br>
is preferred to perform the reaction at 80 to 200 °C<br>
for 10 minutes to 500 hours. When the reaction in step<br>
(1) is performed at a high temperature (e.g., at 200 °C<br>
or more), the 119Sn-NMR chart obtained with respect to<br>
the reaction mixture after step (1) sometimes exhibits<br>
a peak ascribed to a certain substance around 100 ppm,<br>
wherein tetramethyltin is used as a reference in the<br>
119Sn-NMR analysis. However, when the method of the<br>
present invention is repeatedly performed, it is pre-<br>
ferred that the reaction in step (1) is performed under<br>
conditions wherein the formation of the above-mentioned<br>
substance exhibiting a peak around 100 ppm can be sup-<br>
pressed, or the reaction in step (1) is performed using<br>
an additive for suppressing the formation of the above<br>
-mentioned substance exhibiting a peak around 100 ppm.<br>
With respect to the amount of carbon dioxide, when<br>
the reaction in step (1) is performed at room tempera-<br>
ture (20 °C), it suffices if carbon dioxide is used in<br>
an amount which is the stoichiometric amount relative<br>
to the amount of the reactive organometal compound used<br>
in step (1). However, when the reaction in step (1) is<br>
performed at a temperature which is higher than room<br>
temperature (20 °C) under conditions wherein the amount<br>
of carbon dioxide is the stoichiometric amount relative<br><br>
to the amount of the reactive organometal compound used<br>
in step (1), the rate of the addition bonding of carbon<br>
dioxide to the reactive organometal compound sometimes<br>
becomes very low, so that the rate of the formation of<br>
the carbonic ester is markedly lowered. The pressure<br>
employed for the reaction performed in step (1) is gen-<br>
erally from atmospheric pressure to 200 MPa, preferably<br>
from atmospheric pressure to 100 MPa, wherein, if de-<br>
sired, the reaction may be performed while introducing<br>
additional carbon dioxide into the reaction system or<br>
withdrawing a part of carbon dioxide from the reaction<br>
system. The introduction of additional carbon dioxide<br>
into the reaction system may be performed either inter-<br>
mittently or continuously.<br>
In the method of the present invention, the reac-<br>
tion system in step (1) may contain substances other<br>
than mentioned above. Examples of other substances<br>
which are useful in step (1) include those which func-<br>
tion as a dehydrating agent in the reaction system. By<br>
using a dehydrating agent in step (1), the reaction<br>
system can be maintained non-aqueous. As a dehydrating<br>
agent, any conventional organic dehydrating agent may<br>
be used. Examples of dehydrating agents include acet-<br>
als and orthoesters, such as orthotrimethyl acetate.<br>
Further, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and the like may also<br><br>
be used as an organic dehydrating agent. Alternatively,<br>
solid dehydrating agents, such as molecular sieves, may<br>
be used as a dehydrating agent. When a solid dehydrat-<br>
ing agent is used, it is preferred that the solid dehy-<br>
drating agent is removed from the reaction system be-<br>
fore step (3) is performed.<br>
In step (1) of the method of the present invention,<br>
an alcohol (second alcohol) is optionally used. From<br>
the viewpoint of improving the purity of the carbonic<br>
ester, as the second alcohol, it is preferred to use an<br>
alcohol having an organic group which is the same as<br>
the organic group of the oxy group (e.g., an alkoxy<br>
group or an aralkyloxy group) of the reactive organome-<br>
tal compound. When such an alcohol is used as the sec-<br>
ond alcohol, it is preferred that the amount of the<br>
second alcohol is 1 to 100,000 times the stoichiometric<br>
amount relative to the amount of the reactive organome-<br>
tal compound. On the other hand, when an alcohol hav-<br>
ing an organic group different from that of the oxy<br>
group of the reactive organometal compound is used as<br>
the second alcohol or when, as the reactive organometal<br>
compound, only an organometal compound of formula (2)<br>
is used, the amount of the second alcohol is preferably<br>
2 to 1,000 times, more preferably 10 to 1,000 times, as<br>
large as the stoichiometric amount relative to the<br><br>
amount of the reactive organometal compound. When an<br>
alcohol having an organic group different from that of<br>
the oxy group of the reactive organometal compound is<br>
used as the second alcohol, an asymmetric carbonic es-<br>
ter is produced in step (1). As mentioned below, when<br>
a second alcohol is used in step (1), especially in the<br>
case where the organometal compound represented by for-<br>
mula (2) is used alone, the yield of the carbonic ester<br>
is greatly improved. The above-mentioned preferred<br>
amount of the second alcohol in the case where the or-<br>
ganometal compound represented by formula (2) is used<br>
alone, is determined from this viewpoint.<br>
In the case where the below-mentioned step (4) is<br>
followed by step (1), a second alcohol may be added to<br>
the reaction system so that the amount of the second<br>
alcohol falls within the above-mentioned preferred<br>
range. Alternatively, in such case where step (4) is<br>
followed by step (1), an alcohol may be removed from<br>
the reaction system.<br>
As mentioned above, in step (1) of the method of<br>
the present invention, by performing a reaction between<br>
a first organometal compound mixture comprising a mix-<br>
ture of a reactive organometal compound and an unregen-<br>
erable unreactive compound (which is derived from the<br>
reactive organometal compound) and carbon dioxide.<br><br>
there is obtained a reaction mixture containing a car-<br>
bonic ester formed by the reaction, the unregenerable<br>
unreactive compound (i.e., the degraded compound) and a<br>
regenerable metamorphic organometal compound derived<br>
from the reactive organometal compound.<br>
When it is confirmed by the analysis of the reac-<br>
tion mixture that a desired carbonic ester has been ob-<br>
tained, step (1) is finished. For example, when the<br>
carbonic ester is obtained in an amount which is 5 % or<br>
more, based on the stoichiometric amount relative to<br>
the amount of the reactive organometal compound, step<br>
(1) may be finished. The reaction mixture may be taken<br>
out from the reactor, either after the pressure in the<br>
reactor is reduced to atmospheric pressure, or without<br>
lowering the pressure in the reactor. When step (1),<br>
step (2) and step (3) are performed in separate reac-<br>
tors, the reaction mixture may be continuously circu-<br>
lated by, for example, a method in which the reaction<br>
mixture after step (3) is fed to the reactor for step<br>
(1); the reaction mixture contained in the reactor for<br>
step (1) is fed to the reactor for step (2); and the<br>
reaction mixture contained in the reactor for step (2)<br>
is fed to the reactor for step (3). The circulation of<br>
the reaction mixture is preferred from the viewpoint of<br>
reducing the amount of carbon dioxide purged from the<br><br>
reactor (for step (1)) which has carbon dioxide filled<br>
therein. The reaction mixture obtained at completion<br>
of each step may be cooled or heated. When the reac-<br>
tion mixture is cooled, the reaction mixture may be<br>
forcibly cooled or allowed to cool spontaneously. As<br>
described below, if desired, step (1) for synthesizing<br>
a carbonic ester and step (2) for separating the syn-<br>
thesized carbonic ester can be simultaneously performed.<br>
Step (2) of the method of the present invention is<br>
a step in which the reaction mixture obtained in step<br>
(1) is separated into a first portion containing the<br>
carbonic ester and the degraded compound (i.e., the un-<br>
regenerable unreactive compound), and a second portion<br>
containing the regenerable metamorphic organometal com-<br>
pound. By such separation as to cause the degraded<br>
compound derived from the reactive organometal compound<br>
to be contained in the first portion containing the<br>
carbonic ester (wherein the first portion is taken out<br>
from the reaction system), it becomes possible to pre-<br>
vent the degraded compound from accumulating in the re-<br>
action system. Thus, all the problems of the conven-<br>
tional methods have been solved by the method of the<br>
present invention.<br>
As described above, in the production of a car-<br>
bonic ester from carbon dioxide and an alcohol by a<br><br>
conventional method using the reaction of formula (3),<br>
water as well as a carbonic ester is formed, and the<br>
water is contacted with an adsorbent or a dehydrating<br>
agent to remove the water from the reaction system,<br>
thereby displacing the equilibrium of the reaction to-<br>
ward the product system. Theoretically, the amount of<br>
a carbonic ester produced can also be increased by con-<br>
tinuously removing the produced carbonic ester from the<br>
reaction system so as to displace the equilibrium of<br>
the reaction toward the product system. However, in<br>
the conventional method, when the produced carbonic es-<br>
ter is removed from the reaction system, water produced<br>
by the reaction accumulates in the reaction system. As<br>
is well known in the art, if water accumulates in the<br>
reaction system, the catalyst is hydrolyzed by the wa-<br>
ter and loses its catalyst activity. The hydrolyzed<br>
catalyst has very poor solubility in the solvent and,<br>
hence, poses a problem in that, in a subsequent dehy-<br>
dration step performed using an adsorption column, the<br>
hydrolyzed catalyst causes clogging of the adsorption<br>
column. Further, there has not been a method for re-<br>
generating the catalyst which has lost its catalyst ac-<br>
tivity by the hydrolysis thereof. For this reason, in<br>
the conventional methods, it has been impossible to ef-<br>
ficiently separate the produced carbonic ester from the<br><br>
reaction mixture.<br>
In step (2) of the method of the present invention,<br>
a conventional method for separating the carbonic ester<br>
from the reaction mixture can be used, so long as the<br>
effect of the method of the present invention is not<br>
impaired. For example, the separation of the carbonic<br>
ester from the reaction mixture can be performed by any<br>
of filtration, solvent extraction, distillation and<br>
membrane filtration, each of which is well known in the<br>
art. As a preferred example of an extraction solvent,<br>
there can be mentioned a solvent having no reactivity<br>
to the carbonic ester. Examples of such solvents in-<br>
clude hydrocarbons, such as hexane and cyclohexane;<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene and<br>
chlorobenzene; and ethers, such as diethyl ether and<br>
anisole. The distillation can be performed by any con-<br>
ventional method. For example, the distillation can be<br>
performed by any of a distillation under atmospheric<br>
pressure, a distillation under reduced pressure, a dis-<br>
tillation under superatmospheric pressure, and a thin<br>
film distillation, each of which is well known in the<br>
art. The temperature for the distillation varies de-<br>
pending on the type of the carbonic ester to be pro-<br>
duced, but it is preferred that the temperature is from<br>
-20 to 200 °C. The distillation may be performed ei-<br><br>
ther in the presence of a solvent or by extractive<br>
distillation. On the other hand, as mentioned above,<br>
when the distillation is performed under heating, the<br>
separation of the carbonic ester by distillation is<br>
sometimes accompanied by the following disadvantage.<br>
When the distillation is performed under heating, a re-<br>
verse reaction of a carbonic ester and other thermal<br>
decomposition products in the equilibrium reaction is<br>
sometimes caused to occur, thereby lowering the yield<br>
of the carbonic ester. However, in such a case, when<br>
the first portion containing a carbonic ester having a<br>
high boiling point is separated from the reaction mix-<br>
ture by distillation, the carbonic ester can be ob-<br>
tained in high yield by separating the carbonic ester<br>
from the reaction mixture at a rate which is higher<br>
than the rate of the reverse reaction. For this pur-<br>
pose, it is preferred to perform the distillation under<br>
conditions wherein the distillation temperature and the<br>
degree of pressure reduction are appropriately adjusted.<br>
In step (2), if desired, a third alcohol may be<br>
used. When a third alcohol is added to the reaction<br>
system, an ester exchange reaction occurs between the<br>
carbonic ester obtained in step (1) and the third alco-<br>
hol to thereby obtain a carbonic ester which has a dif-<br>
ferent number of carbon atoms from that of the carbonic<br><br>
ester obtained in step (1). The amount of the third<br>
alcohol used in step (2) is 1 to 1,000 times the<br>
stoichiometric amount relative to the amount of the re-<br>
active organometal compound used in step (1). The tem-<br>
perature employed for the ester exchange reaction is<br>
preferably in the range of from room temperature (about<br>
20 °C) to 200 °C. Taking into consideration the desired<br>
rate of the ester exchange reaction and the occurrence<br>
of a decomposition reaction of the carbonic ester at a<br>
high temperature, the temperature employed for the es-<br>
ter exchange reaction is more preferably in the range<br>
of from 50 to 150 °C. In the ester exchange reaction,<br>
a conventional catalyst may be used. The ester ex-<br>
change reaction and the separation of the carbonic es-<br>
ter from the reaction mixture may be performed either<br>
in a batchwise manner or simultaneously. As a method<br>
for separating the first portion containing the car-<br>
bonic ester from the reaction mixture after the ester<br>
exchange reaction, any of the above-mentioned separa-<br>
tion methods (such as filtration, solvent extraction,<br>
distillation and membrane filtration) can be used.<br>
By the method of the present invention, not only a<br>
symmetric carbonic ester but also an asymmetric car-<br>
bonic ester can be produced. In the case of the pro-<br>
duction of an asymmetric carbonic ester by using a con-<br><br>
ventional method, a symmetric carbonic ester is first<br>
produced, and the produced symmetric carbonic ester is<br>
then subjected to an ester exchange reaction to produce<br>
an asymmetric carbonic ester. On the other hand, in<br>
the method of the present invention, an asymmetric car-<br>
bonic ester can be directly produced. Therefore, the<br>
method of the present invention is advantageous from<br>
the viewpoint of reducing the energy cost and reducing<br>
the facility construction cost. In the method of the<br>
present invention, an asymmetric carbonic ester can be<br>
produced as follows. Explanations are given below,<br>
taking as an example the case where the reactive<br>
organometal compound has at least one type of alkoxy<br>
group. When the reactive organometal compound used in<br>
step (1) has two different types of alkoxy groups, an<br>
asymmetric carbonic ester can be produced without use<br>
of alcohols (as a second alcohol and a third alcohol)<br>
in steps (1) and (2). On the other hand, when the or-<br>
ganometal compound used in step (1) has only one type<br>
of alkoxy group, an asymmetric carbonic ester can be<br>
produced by performing step (1) in the presence of an<br>
alcohol (second alcohol) having an organic group which<br>
is different from the alkoxy group of the reactive or-<br>
ganometal compound, or by performing step (2) in the<br>
presence of an alcohol (third alcohol) having an or-<br><br>
ganic group which is different from the alkoxy group of<br>
the reactive organometal compound. Further, in each of<br>
the case where the reactive organometal compound used<br>
in step (1) has only one type of alkoxy group and the<br>
case where the reactive organometal compound used in<br>
step (1) has two different types of alkoxy groups, an<br>
asymmetric carbonic ester can also be produced by per-<br>
forming step (1) in the presence of two different alco-<br>
hols (second alcohols), or by performing step (2) in<br>
the presence of two different alcohols (third alcohols).<br>
When two different alcohols are used, the stoichiomet-<br>
ric ratio of the two alcohols varies depending on the<br>
types of the two alcohols; however, the stoichiometric<br>
ratio is generally in the range of from 2:8 to 8:2,<br>
wherein each of the amounts of the two alcohols is ex-<br>
pressed in terms of the stoichiometric amount relative<br>
to the amount of the reactive organometal compound.<br>
When it is intended to produce an asymmetric carbonic<br>
ester in an amount which is larger than that of a sym-<br>
metric carbonic ester, it is preferred that the<br>
stoichiometric ratio of the two alcohols is as close to<br>
1:1 as possible. Specifically, the stoichiometric ra-<br>
tio of the two alcohols is preferably in the range of<br>
from 3:7 to 7:3, more preferably in the range of from<br>
4:6 to 6:4. When the production of an asymmetric car-<br><br>
bonic ester is performed using two different alcohols<br>
which are used in excess amounts (for example, amounts<br>
each of which is at least 10 times the stoichiometric<br>
amount relative to the amount of the reactive organome-<br>
tal compound), it becomes possible to obtain an asym-<br>
metric carbonic ester having two different types of<br>
alkoxy groups corresponding to the two alcohols, irre-<br>
spective of the type of the alkoxy group of the reac-<br>
tive organometal compound used in step (1). The sepa-<br>
ration of the first portion containing the asymmetric<br>
carbonic ester from the reaction mixture can be per-<br>
formed by any of the methods (such as filtration, sol-<br>
vent extraction, distillation and membrane filtration)<br>
described above in connection with step (2). In many<br>
cases, not only an asymmetric carbonic ester but also a<br>
symmetric carbonic ester is produced. In such cases,<br>
the following operation may be performed. The asymmet-<br>
ric and symmetric carbonic esters are separated from<br>
the first portion. The asymmetric carbonic ester is<br>
separated from the symmetric carbonic ester. The sym-<br>
metric carbonic ester is either added to the second<br>
portion containing the regenerable metamorphic compound,<br>
followed by performing step (3), or returned to step<br>
(1) or (2).<br>
As mentioned above, in step (2) of the method of<br><br>
the present invention, a mixture containing a degraded<br>
compound derived from the reactive organometal compound<br>
and the carbonic ester is separated from the reaction<br>
mixture as the first portion. With respect to the re-<br>
moval of the degraded compound, all of the degraded<br>
compound may be removed or a part of the degraded com-<br>
pound may be removed. The amount of the degraded com-<br>
pound removed may vary depending on the size of the re-<br>
actor and/or the number of turnovers (i.e., the number<br>
of cycles of regeneration and reuse) of the reactive<br>
organometal compound. It is preferred that 10 % or<br>
more of the degraded compound is removed. It is more<br>
preferred that 50 % or more of the degraded compound is<br>
removed.<br>
With respect to the separation method performed in<br>
step (2) of the method of the present invention, more<br>
detailed explanations are given below. The separation<br>
of the reaction mixture obtained in step (1) into the<br>
first portion and the second portion can be performed<br>
by any of the above-mentioned conventional methods. As<br>
preferred examples of such methods, there can be men-<br>
tioned a method in which water is added to the reaction<br>
mixture to effect a phase separation, and a method us-<br>
ing distillation. Each of these methods are explained<br>
below.<br><br>
1) A separation method in which water is added to the<br>
reaction mixture:<br>
Water or a water-containing solvent is added to<br>
the reaction mixture obtained in step (1) to form a<br>
white slurry, and solids in the white slurry are re-<br>
moved by filtration. By the filtration, the second<br>
portion containing the regenerable metamorphic or-<br>
ganometal compound can be obtained as a filtration<br>
residue and the first portion containing the carbonic<br>
ester and the degraded compound can be obtained as a<br>
filtrate. With respect to the water used in this<br>
method, there is no particular limitation; however, it<br>
is preferred to use a distilled water or a deionized<br>
water.<br>
The amount of water used in step (2) is generally<br>
1 to 100 times the stoichiometric amount relative to<br>
the amount of the reactive organometal compound used in<br>
step (1). The amount of water needed for separating<br>
the second portion (containing the regenerable metamor-<br>
phic organometal compound) from the reaction mixture by<br>
phase separation is at most 1 times as large as the<br>
stoichiometric amount relative to the amount of the re-<br>
active organometal compound used in step (1).<br>
In step (2), the temperature at which water is<br>
added to the reaction mixture obtained in step (1) is<br><br>
in the range of from a temperature (e.g., -20 °C) at<br>
which the water is not frozen in the reaction mixture<br>
to 100 °C, preferably from 0 to 100 °C, more preferably<br>
from 10 to 80 °C. From the viewpoint of satisfactorily<br>
suppressing the occurrence of the hydrolysis of the<br>
carbonic ester, it is more preferred to adjust the tem-<br>
perature of water to 10 to 50 °C. When water is used<br>
in step (2), water may be used alone or in combination<br>
with a solvent other than water. As a solvent other<br>
than water, it is preferred to use a solvent which does<br>
not react with the carbonic ester. In this case, when<br>
water is used in the form of a solution thereof in an<br>
alcohol which is the same as the second alcohol used in<br>
step (1), the separation of the solvent by the distil-<br>
lation becomes easy. When a third alcohol is used in<br>
step (2) to perform an ester exchange reaction, it is<br>
preferred that water is used in the form of a solution<br>
thereof in an alcohol which is the same as the alcohol<br>
present in the reaction mixture after the ester ex-<br>
change reaction.<br>
In step (2), when water is added to the reaction<br>
mixture, it is possible that the degraded compound also<br>
gradually undergoes hydrolysis, thus causing the so-<br>
lidification of the degraded compound. Therefore, it<br>
is preferred that, after the addition of water to the<br><br>
reaction mixture, the resultant white slurry is sub-<br>
jected to filtration as quickly as possible upon com-<br>
pletion of the solidification of the second portion<br>
containing the regenerable metamorphic organometal com-<br>
pound. The period of time from the addition of water<br>
to the filtration varies depending on the types of the<br>
reactive organometal compound and alcohol used. When<br>
the separation in step (2) is performed at room tem-<br>
perature, the period of time is in the range of from 30<br>
seconds to 60 minutes, preferably from 1 to 10 minutes.<br>
2) A separation method using distillation<br>
The reaction mixture obtained in step (1) is sub-<br>
jected to distillation to thereby separate the reaction<br>
mixture into the first portion containing the carbonic<br>
ester and the degraded compound and the second portion<br>
containing the regenerable metamorphic organometal com-<br>
pound. Each of the carbonic ester and the degraded<br>
compound has a boiling point lower than that of the re-<br>
generable metamorphic organometal compound. Therefore,<br>
the distillation can be performed by any conventional<br>
method. For example, the distillation can be performed<br>
by any of a distillation under superatmospheric pres-<br>
sure, a distillation under reduced pressure, a distil-<br>
lation under heating, a thin film distillation and a<br>
pervaporation using a membrane, each of which is well<br><br>
known in the art.<br>
The temperature employed for the distillation is<br>
not particularly limited so long as the degraded com-<br>
pound has a vapor pressure at the temperature; however,<br>
the temperature is preferably from -20 to 300 °C. From<br>
the viewpoint of minimizing the loss of the carbonic<br>
ester contained in the reaction mixture caused by the<br>
above-mentioned reverse reaction, it is more preferred<br>
that the temperature employed for distillation is from<br>
-20 to 200 °C. For adjusting the temperature employed<br>
for distillation, the distillation may be performed ei-<br>
ther under superatmospheric pressure or under reduced<br>
pressure. Further, the distillation may be performed<br>
either in a continuous manner or in a batchwise manner.<br>
The separation of the carbonic ester from the<br>
first portion (containing the carbonic ester and the<br>
unregenerable unreactive compound) obtained in step (2)<br>
can be performed easily by any of the conventional<br>
methods, such as adsorption, distillation, filtration<br>
and membrane separation.<br>
Step (3) is a step of synthesizing (regenerating)<br>
a reactive organometal compound having in its molecule<br>
at least two metal-oxygen-carbon linkages. The com-<br>
pound in the second portion obtained in step (2) is<br>
generally in the form of a transparent or opaque liquid.<br><br>
For example, the second portion does not contain dibu-<br>
tyltin oxide in the form of a solid (it should be noted<br>
that dibutyltin oxide has no solubility in almost all<br>
organic solvents at room temperature (20 °C) and, hence,<br>
is in the form of a solid under such conditions). The<br>
structure of the compound in the second portion has not<br>
yet been identified. However, it has surprisingly been<br>
found that, by performing the reaction in step (3) of<br>
the method of the present invention, there can be ob-<br>
tained a reactive organometal compound having in its<br>
molecule at least two metal-oxygen-carbon linkages,<br>
such as an organometal compound represented by formula<br>
(1) or an organometal compound represented by formula<br>
(2).<br>
Step (3) comprises reacting the second portion (of<br>
the reaction mixture) obtained in step (2) with a first<br>
alcohol to form a second organometal compound mixture<br>
and water and removing the water from the second or-<br>
ganometal compound mixture, wherein the second or-<br>
ganometal compound mixture comprises a mixture of a re-<br>
active organometal compound having in its molecule at<br>
least two metal-oxygen-carbon linkages and an unregen-<br>
erable unreactive compound which is derived from the<br>
reactive organometal compound. If desired, the method<br>
of the present invention may further comprise, after<br><br>
step (3), a step (4) in which the second organometal<br>
compound mixture obtained in step (3) is recovered and<br>
recycled to step (1).<br>
Examples of first alcohols used in step (3) in-<br>
clude those which are exemplified above. If desired,<br>
prior to use of any of the above-mentioned alcohols,<br>
distillation of the alcohol may be performed for puri-<br>
fying the alcohol or adjusting the concentration of the<br>
alcohol. From this viewpoint, it is preferred to use<br>
an alcohol having a boiling point of 300 °C or lower as<br>
measured under atmospheric pressure. From the view-<br>
point of the ease in the removal of water in step (3),<br>
it is more preferred to use at least one alcohol se-<br>
lected from the group consisting of 1-butanol, 2<br>
-methyl-1-propanol, an alkyl alcohol having five or<br>
more carbon atoms, and an aralkyl alcohol having five<br>
or more carbon atoms.<br>
With respect to the structure of a reactive or-<br>
ganometal compound obtained by using a polyhydric alco-<br>
hol as a first alcohol in step (3), there is no par-<br>
ticular limitation. For example, the organometal com-<br>
pound may be comprised of at least one member selected<br>
from the group consisting of a crosslinked product of<br>
an organometal compound represented by formula (1) and<br>
a crosslinked product of an organometal compound repre-<br><br>
sented by formula (2).<br>
The amount of the first alcohol used in step (3)<br>
is preferably 1 to 10,000 times, more preferably 2 to<br>
100 times, the stoichiometric amount relative to the<br>
amount of the reactive organometal compound used in<br>
step (1). When a sequence of steps (1) to (4) is re-<br>
peated one or more times, it is sometimes possible that<br>
an alcohol is present in the second portion obtained in<br>
step (2). In such cases, an appropriate amount of an<br>
alcohol may be added to the second portion so that the<br>
amount of the alcohol in the second portion falls<br>
within the above-mentioned range of the amount of the<br>
first alcohol. Alternatively, the alcohol present in<br>
the second portion may be removed.<br>
The removal of water in step (3) can be performed<br>
by any conventional method. For example, the removal<br>
of water in step (3) can be performed by any of distil-<br>
lation, a method using a dehydration column packed with<br>
a solid dehydrating agent (such as molecular sieves),<br>
and a method using membrane separation (such as per-<br>
vaporation). Among them, distillation and a method us-<br>
ing membrane separation (such as pervaporation) are<br>
preferred. It is well known that pervaporation can be<br>
used for the removal of water in an alcohol. In the<br>
present invention, pervaporation can be preferably used.<br><br>
In the case of an alcohol having a boiling point higher<br>
than that of water, the removal of water in the alcohol<br>
can also be easily performed by distillation under<br>
heating. On the other hand, in the case of an alcohol<br>
having a boiling point lower than that of water, the<br>
removal of water in the alcohol can also be performed<br>
by a distillation technique in which a solvent forming<br>
an azeotropic mixture with water is used. As mentioned<br>
above, the removal of water in the alcohol can be per-<br>
formed by any of a method using a solid dehydrating<br>
agent, distillation and membrane separation. However,<br>
when it is desired to obtain the second organometal<br>
compound mixture in a large amount in a short period of<br>
time, it is preferred that the removal of water in the<br>
alcohol is performed by distillation. The distillation<br>
can be performed by any conventional method. For exam-<br>
ple, the distillation can be performed by any of a dis-<br>
tillation under atmospheric pressure, a distillation<br>
under reduced pressure, a distillation under superat-<br>
mospheric pressure, a thin film distillation and an ex-<br>
tractive distillation, each of which is well known in<br>
the art. The distillation can be performed at a tem-<br>
perature of from -20oC to the boiling point of the<br>
first alcohol used in step (3). It is preferred that<br>
the distillation temperature is from 50°C to the boil-<br><br>
ing point of the first alcohol used in step (3). Be-<br>
fore or during the distillation, any desired substance<br>
may be added to the second portion of the second por-<br>
tion of the reaction mixture. The second portion of<br>
reaction mixture may contain, for example, a solvent<br>
which forms an azeotropic mixture with water from the<br>
viewpoint of the ease in the removal of water in step<br>
(3); or a solvent which enhances the hydrophobic prop-<br>
erty of the second portion of the reaction mixture so<br>
that the vapor-liquid equilibrium of the water formed<br>
by the reaction in step (3) becomes advantageous. Fur-<br>
ther, the second portion of the reaction mixture may<br>
contain a solvent which adjusts the fluidity of the<br>
second portion of the reaction mixture.<br>
The temperature employed for the reaction per-<br>
formed in step (3) varies depending on the type of the<br>
first alcohol used; however, the temperature is gener-<br>
ally from room temperature (about 20°C) to 300°C.<br>
When the removal of water in step (3) is performed by<br>
distillation, the temperature employed for the distil-<br>
lation is not particularly limited so long as water has<br>
a vapor pressure at the temperature. When it is in-<br>
tended to complete the reaction in step (3) in a short<br>
period of time under atmospheric pressure, it is pre-<br>
ferred that the distillation is performed under condi-<br><br>
tions wherein the temperature of the vapor formed by<br>
distillation is the azeotropic temperature of water and<br>
the first alcohol. When water and the first alcohol do<br>
not form an azeotropic mixture, it is preferred that<br>
the distillation is performed at the boiling point of<br>
water. When it is intended to complete the reaction in<br>
step (3) in a shorter period of time, the distillation<br>
may be performed, using an autoclave, at a temperature<br>
higher than the boiling point of the first alcohol or<br>
water while gradually removing water in the vapor phase.<br>
When the temperature employed for the reaction per-<br>
formed in step (3) is extremely high, it is sometimes<br>
possible that a thermal decomposition of the reactive<br>
organometal compound occurs. In such cases, a liquid<br>
containing water may be removed by reduced pressure<br>
distillation or the like.<br>
Even when the first alcohol does not form an<br>
azeotropic mixture with water, water can be removed by<br>
azeotropic distillation in which a solvent forming an<br>
azeotropic mixture with water is used. This method is<br>
preferred since water can be removed at a low tempera-<br>
ture. Examples of solvents which form an azeotropic<br>
mixture with water include unsaturated and saturated<br>
hydrocarbons, such as hexane, benzene, toluene, xylene,<br>
naphthalene; ethers, such as anisole and 1,4-dioxane;<br><br>
and halogenated hydrocarbons, such as chloroform.<br>
From the viewpoint of facilitating the separation<br>
of water from the azeotropic mixture after azeotropic<br>
distillation, it is preferred to use, as a solvent, an<br>
unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon in which water has<br>
low solubility. When such a solvent is used, it is<br>
necessary to use the solvent in an amount such that wa-<br>
ter can be satisfactorily removed by azeotropic distil-<br>
lation. It is preferred to use a distillation column<br>
for the azeotropic distillation because the solvent can<br>
be recycled to the reaction system after separating the<br>
solvent from the azeotropic mixture in the distillation<br>
column and, hence, the amount of the solvent can be re-<br>
duced to a relatively small one.<br>
By performing the reaction in step (3), there can<br>
be obtained, for example, an organometal compound mix-<br>
ture containing at least one reactive organometal com-<br>
pound selected from the group consisting of an or-<br>
ganometal compound represented by formula (1) and an<br>
organometal compound represented by formula (2).<br>
When the reaction in step (3) reaches a stage<br>
where almost no water is generated, step (3) can be<br>
finished. When a sequence of steps (1) to (4) is re-<br>
peated one or more times, the amount of the carbonic<br>
ester obtained in step (1) varies depending on the<br><br>
amount of water which is removed in step (3). There-<br>
fore, it is preferred that the amount of water removed<br>
in step (3) is as large as possible.<br>
Generally, the amount of water removed in step (3)<br>
is 0.01 to 1 times as large as the amount of water pro-<br>
duced by the reaction in step (3), wherein the amount<br>
of water produced is theoretically calculated based on<br>
the assumption that only an organometal compound repre-<br>
sented by formula (1) is produced by the reaction in<br>
step (3). In many cases, the amount of water removed<br>
in step (3) is less than 1 times as large as the above<br>
-mentioned theoretical amount of water produced by the<br>
reaction in step (3). As a result of the studies made<br>
by the present inventors, it has been found that, when<br>
an organometal compound is produced from dibutyltin ox-<br>
ide and an alcohol and a sequence of steps (1) to (4)<br>
is repeated one or more times, the amount of water re-<br>
moved in step (3) is less than the amount of water gen-<br>
erated during the reaction in which the reactive or-<br>
ganometal compound is produced from dibutyltin oxide<br>
and an alcohol. When, in step (2), water is added to<br>
the reaction system for separating the first portion<br>
containing the carbonic ester and the degraded compound,<br>
it is sometimes possible that a white solid containing<br>
water is obtained and the amount of water removed in<br><br>
step (3) is more than 1 times the above-mentioned theo-<br>
retical amount of water produced by the reaction in<br>
step (3). When a sequence of steps (1) to (4) is re-<br>
peated one or more times, it is difficult to calculate<br>
a theoretical amount of water produced by the reaction<br>
performed in step (3) because the structure of the re-<br>
generable metamorphic organometal compound contained in<br>
the reaction mixture obtained in step (1) has not yet<br>
been identified. In this case, the change (with time)<br>
in the amount of water which is removed is measured.<br>
When it is confirmed by the measurement that almost no<br>
more water is removed, step (3) may be finished.<br>
After completion of step (3), if desired, an ex-<br>
cess amount of the alcohol may be removed. From the<br>
viewpoint of improving the purity of the carbonic ester<br>
obtained in step (1) in the case where a sequence of<br>
steps (1) to (4) is repeated one or more times, it is<br>
preferred to remove an excess amount of the alcohol.<br>
When the same alcohol as used in step (3) is used in<br>
step (1) in the case where a sequence of steps (1) to<br>
(4) is repeated one or more times, the removal of the<br>
alcohol after step (3) may not be performed. Further,<br>
an appropriate amount of the alcohol may be added to<br>
the reaction system after step (3).<br>
The removal of an excess amount of the alcohol can<br><br>
be performed as follows. When the second organometal<br>
compound mixture obtained in step (3) is in the form of<br>
a solid, the alcohol can be removed as a filtrate ob-<br>
tained by filtration. On the other hand, when the sec-<br>
ond organometal compound mixture obtained in step (3)<br>
is in the form of a liquid, the removal of the alcohol<br>
can be performed by a distillation under reduced pres-<br>
sure, or by a method in which an inert gas, such as ni-<br>
trogen, is introduced into the reactor so that the al-<br>
cohol is removed in an amount which corresponds to the<br>
vapor pressure of the alcohol. In the case of using an<br>
inert gas, when the inert gas is not completely dried,<br>
a disadvantage is likely to occur wherein the second<br>
organometal compound mixture is hydrolyzed and decom-<br>
posed into a metal oxide and an alcohol, so that the<br>
amount of the carbonic ester obtained by the reaction<br>
in step (1) in the case where a sequence of steps (1)<br>
to (4) is repeated one or more times, becomes extremely<br>
lowered. Steps (1) to (3) may be performed either in-<br>
termittently or in a batchwise manner.<br>
As described above, if desired, steps (1) and (2)<br>
can be simultaneously performed. Also, if desired,<br>
steps (2) and (3) can be simultaneously performed.<br>
Further, steps (1) to (3) can also be simultaneously<br>
performed. Further, when the method of the present in-<br><br>
vention is repeated one or more times, if desired, step<br>
(3) and step (1) of the subsequent cycle can be simul-<br>
taneously performed. With respect to the cases where<br>
these steps are simultaneously performed, explanations<br>
are given below.<br>
(The case where steps (1) and (2) are simultaneously<br>
performed)<br>
With respect to the reaction performed in step (1),<br>
there are two cases: one (first case) is the case where<br>
a liquid phase and a vapor phase are present during the<br>
performance of the reaction in step (1), and the other<br>
(second case) is the case where carbon dioxide is in a<br>
supercritical state under high temperature and high<br>
pressure conditions and the reaction mixture forms a<br>
homogeneous mixture. Steps (1) and (2) can be simulta-<br>
neously performed in the first case. In the first case,<br>
the reaction temperature and reaction pressure vary<br>
depending on the type of an alkoxy group contained in<br>
the reactive organometal compound and the type of an<br>
alcohol when an alcohol is used. However, the reaction<br>
temperature is generally 200 °C or lower and the reac-<br>
tion pressure is 8 MPa or less. The carbonic ester has<br>
high solubility in carbon dioxide and, hence, a part of<br>
the carbonic ester is dissolved in the vapor phase.<br><br>
Therefore, by performing the reaction in step (1) while<br>
withdrawing a part of the vapor phase, the first por-<br>
tion (containing the carbonic ester and the unregener-<br>
able unreactive compound) can be separated from the re-<br>
action mixture.<br>
(The case where steps (2) and (3) are simultaneously<br>
performed)<br>
Steps (2) and (3) can be simultaneously performed<br>
when the reactive organometal compound is obtained from<br>
an alcohol having a boiling point higher than that of<br>
water, and a C1-C3 alkyl alcohol is used in step (1) or<br>
(2). The separation of the carbonic ester, the de-<br>
graded compound and water from the reaction mixture can<br>
be performed by a method in which the reaction mixture<br>
obtained in step (1) is placed under a stream of an in-<br>
ert gas, such as carbon dioxide gas, thereby removing<br>
the carbonic ester, the degraded compound and water<br>
from the reaction mixture, in such a form as entrained<br>
by the inert gas. The separation of the carbonic ester,<br>
the degraded compound and water from the reaction mix-<br>
ture can also be performed by a conventional method,<br>
such as membrane separation. By such a method, the<br>
carbonic ester, the degraded compound and water can be<br>
continuously separated from the reaction mixture.<br><br>
(The case where steps (1) to (3) are simultaneously<br>
performed)<br>
With respect to the reaction performed in step (1),<br>
there are two cases: one (first case) is the case where<br>
a liquid phase and a vapor phase are present during the<br>
performance of the reaction in step (1), and the other<br>
(second case) is the case where carbon dioxide is in a<br>
supercritical state under high temperature and high<br>
pressure conditions and the reaction mixture forms a<br>
homogeneous mixture. Steps (1) to (3) can be simulta-<br>
neously performed in the case where a liquid phase and<br>
a vapor phase are present during the performance of the<br>
reaction in step (1), the reactive organometal compound<br>
is obtained from an alcohol having a boiling point<br>
higher than that of water, and a C1-C3 alkyl alcohol<br>
(preferably methanol or ethanol) is used. In this case,<br>
the reaction temperature and reaction pressure vary de-<br>
pending on the type of an alkoxy group contained in the<br>
reactive organometal compound and the type of an alco-<br>
hol when an alcohol is used. However, the reaction<br>
temperature is generally 150°C or less and the reac-<br>
tion pressure is generally 5 MPa or less. Water, the<br>
carbonic ester and the degraded compound have high<br>
solubility in carbon dioxide and, hence, a part of each<br><br>
of the water, the carbonic ester and the degraded com-<br>
pound is dissolved in the vapor phase. Therefore, by<br>
performing the reaction in step (1) while withdrawing a<br>
part of the vapor phase, the carbonic ester and the de-<br>
graded compound can be separated from the reaction mix-<br>
ture while regenerating the organometal compound. Fur-<br>
ther, it is also possible to employ a method in which<br>
the reaction is performed in a fixed-bed reactor con-<br>
taining an organometal compound mixture, wherein the<br>
organometal compound mixture is supported on a carrier<br>
or in the form of a solid. In this method, carbon di-<br>
oxide and a C1-C3 alcohol are introduced into the fixed<br>
-bed reactor to effect a reaction, thereby obtaining a<br>
carbonic ester, a degraded compound and water in such a<br>
form as entrained by carbon dioxide gas. As a carrier<br>
for supporting the organometal compound mixture, a con-<br>
ventional carrier can be used.<br>
(The case where step (3) and step (1) of the subsequent<br>
cycle are simultaneously performed when the method of<br>
the present invention is repeated one or more times)<br>
When the method of the present invention is re-<br>
peated one or more times, step (3) and step (1) of the<br>
subsequent cycle can be simultaneously performed by a<br>
method in which step (3) is performed in an atmosphere<br><br>
of or in the presence of carbon dioxide gas. Specifi-<br>
cally, step (3) and step (1) of the subsequent cycle<br>
can be simultaneously performed by a method in which<br>
the second portion (of the reaction mixture) obtained<br>
in step (2) is reacted with a first alcohol to regener-<br>
ate (resynthesize) a reactive organometal compound and<br>
generate water, and the regenerated reactive organome-<br>
tal compound is reacted with carbon dioxide to thereby<br>
obtain a carbonic ester, wherein the water generated is<br>
removed. Step (3) and step (1) of the subsequent cycle<br>
can be simultaneously performed in the case where a<br>
liquid phase and a vapor phase are present in the reac-<br>
tion system. In this case, the reaction temperature<br>
and reaction pressure vary depending on the type of an<br>
alkoxy group contained in the reactive organometal com-<br>
pound and the type of an alcohol used. However, the<br>
reaction temperature is generally 200 °C or lower and<br>
the reaction pressure is 1 MPa or less. It is pre-<br>
ferred that step (3) and step (1) of the subsequent cy-<br>
cle are performed simultaneously by reacting the reac-<br>
tive organometal compound with carbon dioxide in the<br>
presence of an alcohol having a boiling point higher<br>
than 100°C (as measured under atmospheric pressure)<br>
under conditions wherein the reaction temperature is<br>
the same or lower than the boiling point of the alcohol<br><br>
and the pressure is from atmospheric pressure to 0.5<br>
MPa. It is more preferred that step (3) and step (1)<br>
of the subsequent cycle are performed simultaneously by<br>
a method in which carbon dioxide gas is introduced into<br>
the second portion of the reaction mixture so that the<br>
water generated is withdrawn from the reaction system<br>
in such a form as entrained by carbon dioxide gas.<br>
As mentioned above, the method of the present in-<br>
vention may further comprise, after step (3), a step<br>
(4) in which the second organometal compound mixture<br>
obtained in step (3) is recovered and recycled to step<br>
(1). A sequence of steps (1) to (4) can be repeated<br>
one or more times. Prior to the recycle of the or-<br>
ganometal compound to step (1), the organometal com-<br>
pound may be cooled or heated. The step (4) can be<br>
performed either continuously or in a batchwise manner.<br>
In step (3), when the reaction of the second por-<br>
tion of the reaction mixture with a first alcohol is<br>
performed at a high temperature or for a prolonged pe-<br>
riod of time, a problem arises in that the degraded<br>
compound is formed in a large amount. Therefore, it is<br>
preferred that the reaction in step (3) is performed<br>
under conditions wherein the formation of the degraded<br>
compound is suppressed as much as possible. The de-<br>
graded compound (i.e., the unregenerable unreactive<br><br>
compound) is formed by a disproportionation reaction<br>
which is caused to occur when the organometal compounds<br>
respectively represented by formulae (1) and (2) are<br>
heated. In a carbon dioxide atmosphere, such dispro-<br>
portination reaction progresses slowly and, hence, the<br>
unregenerable unreactive compound is formed mainly in<br>
this step (3). With respect to the degraded compound<br>
formed and accumulated prior to the reaction of step<br>
(3), and the degraded compound being formed during the<br>
reaction in step (3), these degraded compounds can be<br>
removed from the reaction system in step (3). The rea-<br>
son is that the degraded compound represented by for-<br>
mula (6) above has a boiling point lower than that of<br>
the reactive organometal compound obtained by the reac-<br>
tion of step (3). The removal of the degraded compound<br>
from the reaction system in step (3) can be performed<br>
by a conventional method, such as distillation or mem-<br>
brane separation. For example, the distillation can be<br>
preferably performed by any of a distillation under su-<br>
peratmospheric pressure, a distillation under reduced<br>
pressure, a distillation under heating and a thin film<br>
distillation. The membrane separation can be preferably<br>
performed by, for example, a pervaporation using a mem-<br>
brane. From the viewpoint of minimizing the number of<br>
steps of the removal method employed, it is more pre-<br><br>
ferred that the removal of the degraded compound is<br>
performed by a method in which, after the water is re-<br>
moved in step (3), the degraded compound is distilled<br>
off under greatly reduced pressure. The temperature<br>
employed for the distillation is not particularly lim-<br>
ited so long as the degraded compound has a vapor pres-<br>
sure at the temperature; however, the temperature is<br>
preferably from about 20 °C to 300 °C. When the distil-<br>
lation is performed under heating at a high temperature,<br>
there is a danger that the amount of the degradation<br>
compound formed further increases. Therefore, it is<br>
more preferred that the temperature employed for dis-<br>
tillation is from 20 to 200 °C.<br>
In the method of the present invention, a solid<br>
degraded compound (other than the above-mentioned unre-<br>
generable unreactive compound) which has in its mole-<br>
cule at least three metal-carbon linkages is sometimes<br>
formed. It is presumed that such solid degraded com-<br>
pound is derived from a disproportionation reaction<br>
product which is formed as a counterpart of the unre-<br>
generable unreactive compound having in its molecule at<br>
least three metal-carbon linkages. As an example of<br>
such solid degraded compound, there can be mentioned a<br>
metal oxide, such as titanium oxide or tin oxide.<br>
These solid degraded compounds can be easily removed<br><br>
from the reaction system by filtration. In step (1),<br>
step (2) (in the case where water is not used) and step<br>
(3), the reaction mixture is generally present in the<br>
form of a homogeneous liquid. Therefore, when solid<br>
degraded compounds are precipitated in the reaction<br>
system as a result of a repetitious use of the or-<br>
ganometal compound, the solid degraded compounds can be<br>
removed by filtration. The filtration can be performed<br>
by any of the conventional methods. For example, the<br>
filtration can be performed by any of a filtration<br>
under atmospheric pressure, a filtration under reduced<br>
pressure, a filtration under superatmospheric pressure<br>
and a centrifugation. When water intrudes into the re-<br>
action system during the filtration, there is a danger<br>
that the useful organometal compound is hydrolyzed and<br>
solidified. Therefore, for preventing the useful or-<br>
ganometal compound from being removed together with the<br>
solid degraded compound, it is preferred that the fil-<br>
tration is performed with a considerable care so as to<br>
suppress the occurrence of the hydrolysis of the or-<br>
ganometal compound.<br>
Hereinbelow, explanations are given with respect<br>
to the reaction vessels used in the method of the pre-<br>
sent invention.<br>
With respect to the type of the reaction vessel<br><br>
used in each of steps (1), (2) and (3), there is no<br>
particular limitation, and any conventional reaction<br>
vessel can be used. Examples of conventional reaction<br>
vessels include a stirring vessel, a multi-stage stir-<br>
ring vessel and a continuous multi-stage distillation<br>
column. These reaction vessels can be used individu-<br>
ally or in combination. Using at least one of the<br>
above-mentioned reaction vessels, steps (1) to (3) may<br>
be performed in a batchwise or continuous manner. Spe-<br>
cifically, with respect to steps (1) and (3), from the<br>
viewpoint of efficiently displacing the equilibrium of<br>
the reaction in the direction of the product system, it<br>
is preferred to use a multi-stage distillation column.<br>
It is more preferred that each of steps (1) and (3) is<br>
continuously performed using a multi-stage distillation<br>
column.<br>
With respect to the multi-stage distillation col-<br>
umn, there is no particular limitation so long as it is<br>
a distillation column which has two or more theoretical<br>
stages and which is capable of continuous distillation.<br>
As such a multi-stage distillation column, any conven-<br>
tional multi-stage distillation column which is gener-<br>
ally used in the art can be used. Examples of such<br>
multi-stage distillation columns include plate type<br>
columns using a tray, such as a bubble-cap tray, a<br><br>
sieve tray, a valve tray or a counterflow tray; and<br>
packed type columns packed with any of various packings,<br>
such as a Raschig ring, a Lessing ring, a Pall ring, a<br>
Berl saddle, an Interlox saddle, a Dixon packing, a<br>
McMahon packing, a Heli pack, a Sulzer packing and Mel-<br>
lapak. Further, a mixed type of plate column and<br>
packed column, which comprises both a plate portion and<br>
a portion packed with packings, can also be preferably<br>
used.<br><br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>

(iii) Quantitative analysis<br>
The quantitative analysis of a sample solution was<br>

(3) Calculation of the yield of a carbonic ester (i.e.,<br>
dialkyl carbonate)<br>
The yield of a dialkyl carbonate was expressed in<br>
terms of the mol % of the dialkyl carbonate, based on<br><br>
the molar amount of the organometal compound used in<br>
step (1), wherein the amount of the organometal com-<br>
pound is expressed in terms of the amount of a metal<br>
atom contained therein.<br>
Example 1<br>
First, a reactive organometal compound having a 2-<br>
ethylhexyloxy group was synthesized from dibutyltin ox-<br>
ide and 2-ethyl-l-hexanol as follows.<br>
Into a 1-liter four-necked flask equipped with a<br>
cooling tube, a thermometer (for the measurement of the<br>
internal temperature of the flask), a vacuum pump and a<br>
vacuum controller (manufactured and sold by Okano Works,<br>
Ltd., Japan) were charged 249 g (1.0 mol) of dibutyltin<br>
oxide (manufactured and sold by Aldrich, U.S.A.), 650 g<br>
(5.0 mol) of 2-ethyl-l-hexanol (manufactured and sold<br>
by Aldrich, U.S.A.; a dehydrated grade). Further, a<br>
stirrer was placed in the flask. The flask was im-<br>
mersed in an oil bath. The atmosphere in the flask was<br>
purged with nitrogen gas. Then, stirring of the con-<br>
tents of the flask was started while heating. When the<br>
internal temperature of the flask reached 172 °C, the<br>
pressure in the flask was gradually reduced while with-<br>
drawing a distillate (i.e., water and 2-ethyl-l<br>
-hexanol) from the flask by means of a purge line, and<br><br>
a reaction was performed for about 7 hours. By reduc-<br>
ing the pressure in the flask, the pressure in the<br>
flask was finally lowered to about 28 KPa. When the<br>
distillate was almost thoroughly withdrawn from the<br>
flask, the flask was taken out from the oil bath, and<br>
the inside of the flask was cooled. Then, nitrogen gas<br>
was introduced into the flask to elevate the pressure<br>
in the flask to atmospheric pressure. By the above-<br>
mentioned operation, 410 g of a viscous liquid was ob-<br>
tained.<br>
The distillate withdrawn from the flask was ana-<br>
lyzed. As a result, it was found that the distillate<br>
contained about 13 g of water. The above-obtained vis-<br>
cous liquid was analyzed by 1H-, 13C- and 119Sn-NMR's.<br>
As a result, it was found that the viscous liquid con-<br>
tained 1,1,3,3-tetrabutyl-l,3-di(2-<br>
ethylhexyloxy)distannoxane, dibutyltin di(2<br>
-ethylhexyloxide) and tributyltin(2-ethylhexyloxide).<br>
Step (1)<br>
404 g of the above-obtained viscous liquid was<br>
charged into a 500-ml autoclave (manufactured and sold<br>
by Toyo Koatsu Co., Ltd., Japan) which had a carbon di-<br>
oxide gas bomb connected thereto through a SUS tube and<br>
a valve. The autoclave was sealed, and the atmosphere<br><br>
in the autoclave was purged with nitrogen gas. Then,<br>
the above-mentioned valve was opened to introduce car-<br>
bon dioxide gas having a pressure of 4 MPa into the<br>
autoclave. The introduction of carbon dioxide gas into<br>
the autoclave was performed for 10 minutes while stir-<br>
ring the contents of the autoclave, and, then, stopped<br>
by closing the valve of the carbon dioxide gas bomb.<br>
Subsequently, the internal temperature of the autoclave<br>
was elevated to 120 oC while stirring. Then, a reac-<br>
tion was performed for 3 hours while maintaining the<br>
internal pressure of the autoclave at 4 MPa by means of<br>
a back-pressure valve of the carbon dioxide gas bomb.<br>
After the reaction, the inside of the autoclave was<br>
cooled to about 30 °C, and carbon dioxide gas was gen-<br>
tly purged therefrom through the purge line to lower<br>
the pressure in the autoclave to atmospheric pressure,<br>
thereby obtaining a transparent liquid as a reaction<br>
mixture. It was found that the yield of di(2<br>
-ethylhexyl) carbonate was 25 %. The reaction mixture<br>
was analyzed by 1H-, 13C- and 119Sn-NMR' s. As a result,<br>
it was confirmed that the reaction mixture contained<br>
tributyltin(2-ethylhexyloxide) and a carbon dioxide ad-<br>
duct thereof in a total amount of about 0.1 mol %.<br>
These two compounds are unregenerable unreactive com-<br>
pounds .<br><br>
Step (2)<br>
After step (1), a thin film distillation apparatus<br>
(E-420; manufactured and sold by Shibata Scientific<br>
Technology Ltd., Japan) having an internal temperature<br>
of 130 ° C and an internal pressure of about 65 Pa was<br>
connected to the autoclave through a liquid transfer-<br>
ring pump (LC-10AT; manufactured and sold by Shimadzu<br>
Corporation, Japan), and a distillation was performed<br>
as follows. About 120 g of the reaction mixture ob-<br>
tained in step (1) was charged into the thin film dis-<br>
tillation apparatus through the liquid transferring<br>
pump at a rate of 3 g/min to distill off the volatile<br>
matter from the reaction mixture, followed by cooling,<br>
thereby recovering about 14 g of the volatile matter in<br>
a liquid form. It was found that about 50 % of the<br>
di(2-ethylhexyl) carbonate contained in the reaction<br>
mixture charged into the thin film distillation appara-<br>
tus was distilled off as a volatile matter. The vola-<br>
tile matter in a liquid form was analyzed by 1H-, 13C-<br>
and 119Sn-NMR's. As a result, it was confirmed that the<br>
volatile matter in a liquid form contained about 0.02<br>
mol of tributyltin(2-ethylhexyloxide).<br>
Step (3)<br><br>
Into a 300-ml four-necked flask equipped with a<br>
cooling tube, a thermometer (for the measurement of the<br>
internal temperature of the flask), a vacuum pump and a<br>
vacuum controller (manufactured and sold by Okano Works,<br>
Ltd., Japan) were charged about 100 g of the distilla-<br>
tion residue obtained by the above-mentioned distilla-<br>
tion, 5 g (about 2 mmol) of dibutyltin oxide (manufac-<br>
tured and sold by Aldrich, U.S.A.). and 216 g (1.7 mol)<br>
of 2-ethyl-l-hexanol (manufactured and sold by Aldrich,<br>
U.S.A.; a dehydrated grade). Further, a stirrer was<br>
placed in the flask. The flask was immersed in an oil<br>
bath. The atmosphere in the flask was purged with ni-<br>
trogen gas. Then, stirring of the contents of the<br>
flask was started while heating. When the internal<br>
temperature of the flask reached 172 °C, the pressure<br>
in the flask was gradually reduced while withdrawing a<br>
distillate (i.e., water and 2-ethyl-l-hexanol) from the<br>
flask by means of a purge line, and a reaction was per-<br>
formed for about 7 hours. By reducing the pressure in<br>
the flask, the pressure in the flask was finally low-<br>
ered to about 28 KPa. When the distillate was almost<br>
thoroughly withdrawn from the flask, the flask was<br>
taken out from the oil bath, and the inside of the<br>
flask was cooled. Then, nitrogen gas was introduced<br>
into the flask to elevate the pressure in the flask to<br><br>
atmospheric pressure. By the above-mentioned operation,<br>
a viscous liquid was obtained.<br>
The above-obtained viscous liquid was analyzed by<br>
1H-, 13C- and 119Sn-NMR's. As a result, it was found<br>
that the viscous liquid contained 1,1,3,3-tetrabutyl<br>
-1,3-di(2-ethylhexyloxy)distannoxane, dibutyltin di(2<br>
-ethylhexyloxide) and tributyltin(2-ethylhexyloxide).<br>
Of these three compounds, the first two compounds are<br>
regenerable metamorphic organometal compounds and the<br>
last one compound is an unregenerable unreactive com-<br>
pound.<br>
The viscous liquid obtained in step (3) above was<br>
recovered and recycled to step (1), and step (1) was<br>
performed as follows.<br>
79 g of the above-obtained viscous liquid was<br>
charged into a 100-ml autoclave (manufactured and sold<br>
by Toyo Koatsu Co., Ltd., Japan) which had a carbon di-<br>
oxide gas bomb connected thereto through a SUS tube and<br>
a valve. The autoclave was sealed, and the atmosphere<br>
in the autoclave was purged with nitrogen gas. Then,<br>
the above-mentioned valve was opened to introduce car-<br>
bon dioxide gas having a pressure of 4 MPa into the<br>
autoclave. The introduction of carbon dioxide gas into<br>
the autoclave was performed for 10 minutes while stir-<br><br>
ring the contents of the autoclave, and, then, stopped<br>
by closing the valve of the carbon dioxide gas bomb.<br>
Subsequently, the internal temperature of the autoclave<br>
was elevated to 120 °C while stirring. Then, a reac-<br>
tion was performed for 3 hours while maintaining the<br>
internal pressure of the autoclave at 4 MPa by means of<br>
a back-pressure valve of the carbon dioxide gas bomb.<br>
After the reaction, the inside of the autoclave was<br>
cooled to about 30 °C, and carbon dioxide gas was gen-<br>
tly purged therefrom through the purge line to lower<br>
the pressure in the autoclave to atmospheric pressure,<br>
thereby obtaining a transparent liquid as a reaction<br>
mixture. It was found that the yield of di(2<br>
-ethylhexyl) carbonate was 25 %.<br>
After step (1), a thin film distillation apparatus<br>
(E-420; manufactured and sold by Shibata Scientific<br>
Technology Ltd., Japan) having an internal temperature<br>
of 130 ° C and an internal pressure of about 65 Pa was<br>
connected to the autoclave through a liquid transfer-<br>
ring pump (LC-10AT; manufactured and sold by Shimadzu<br>
Corporation, Japan), and a distillation was performed<br>
as follows. About 25 g of the reaction mixture ob-<br>
tained in step (1) was charged into the thin film dis-<br>
tillation apparatus through the liquid transferring<br>
pump at a rate of 3 g/min to distill off the volatile<br><br>
matter from the reaction mixture, followed by cooling,<br>
thereby recovering about 14 g of the volatile matter in<br>
a liquid form. It was found that about 50 % of the<br>
di(2-ethylhexyl) carbonate contained in the reaction<br>
mixture charged into the thin film distillation appara-<br>
tus was distilled off as a volatile matter. The vola-<br>
tile matter in a liquid form was analyzed by 1H-, 13C-<br>
and 1 Sn-NMR's. As a result, it was confirmed that the<br>
volatile matter in a liquid form contained about 0.005<br>
mol of tributyltin(2-ethylhexyloxide).<br>
Example 2<br>
Synthesis of an organometal compound having a<br>
hexyloxy group from dibutyltin oxide and hexanol was<br>
performed as follows.<br>
Into a 200-ml autoclave (manufactured and sold by<br>
Toyo Koatsu Co., Ltd., Japan) were charged 24.9 g (100<br>
mmol) of dibutyltin oxide (manufactured and sold by Al-<br>
drich, U.S.A.) and 51.1 g (500 mmol) of hexanol (manu-<br>
factured and sold by Aldrich, U.S.A.; a dehydrated<br>
grade). The autoclave was sealed. The atmosphere in<br>
the autoclave was purged with nitrogen gas. Then,<br>
stirring of the contents of the autoclave was started,<br>
and the internal temperature of the autoclave was ele-<br>
vated to 160 °C. Then, the stirring was continued for<br><br>
about 30 minutes. Thereafter, the valve of the purge<br>
line of the autoclave was opened, and water and hexanol<br>
was distilled off through the purge line over 4 hours<br>
while blowing a small amount of nitrogen gas into the<br>
bottom of the autoclave. After that period, there was<br>
almost no distillate any more. Then, the inside of the<br>
autoclave was cooled to about 30°C, and there was ob-<br>
tained a viscous reaction mixture. 1H-, 13C- and 119Sn-<br>
NMR analyses of the reaction mixture was performed.<br>
The NMR analyses showed that the viscous reaction mix-<br>
ture contained about 40 mmol of 1,1,3,3-tetrabutyl-1,3<br>
-di-hexyloxy-di-stannoxane, about 6 mmol of dibutyltin<br>
dihexyloxide and about 4 mml of tributyltin hexyloxide.<br>
Step (1)<br>
Into the above-mentioned 200-ml autoclave contain-<br>
ing the reaction mixture (containing an organometal<br>
compound having a hexyloxy group) was charged 61.5 g<br>
(602 mmol) of hexanol (manufactured and sold by Aldrich,<br>
U.S.A.; a dehydrated grade), and the autoclave was<br>
sealed. Then, from a carbon dioxide gas bomb which was<br>
connected to the autoclave through a SUS tube and a<br>
valve, carbon dioxide gas having a pressure of 5 MPa<br>
was introduced into the autoclave. Stirring of the<br>
contents of the autoclave was started. 10 Minutes af-<br><br>
ter the start of the stirring, the valve of the carbon<br>
dioxide gas bomb was closed. Then, the internal tem-<br>
perature of the autoclave was elevated to 180°C while<br>
stirring. In this instant, the internal pressure of<br>
the autoclave was about 7.5 MPa. Then, a reaction was<br>
performed for 6 hours while maintaining the internal<br>
pressure of the autoclave at about 7.5 MPa. Thereafter,<br>
the inside of the autoclave was cooled to about 30 ° C<br>
and the internal pressure of the autoclave was returned<br>
to atmospheric pressure by gently purging the carbon<br>
dioxide gas, and there was obtained a transparent reac-<br>
tion mixture. In the reaction mixture, dihexyl carbon-<br>
ate was obtained in a yield of 14 %.<br>
Step (2)<br>
After step (1), 10 g of hexanol containing 1 % of<br>
water was gently added to the reaction mixture obtained<br>
in step (1), and the resultant mixture was stirred for<br>
about 1 minute. Then, the autoclave was opened, and it<br>
was found that the mixture in the autoclave had turned<br>
into a white slurry. The white slurry was subjected to<br>
filtration using a membrane filter (H020A142C, manufac-<br>
tured and sold by Advantec Toyo Kaisha, Ltd., Japan) to<br>
thereby obtain white solids and a filtrate. The white<br>
solids were washed 2 times with 20 ml of hexanol. The<br><br>
filtrate was transferred into a 1-liter eggplant-shaped<br>
flask and subjected to a distillation under heating in<br>
an oil bath at 160 °C and under reduced pressure. By<br>
the distillation, hexanol, tributyltin hexyloxide and<br>
dihexyl carbonate were recovered as a distillate. The<br>
yield of dihexyl carbonate was 13 %. It was found that<br>
the distillate contained about 2 nutiol of tributyltin<br>
hexyloxide. On the other hand, a viscous liquid re-<br>
mained in the flask after completion of the distilla-<br>
tion.<br>
Step (3)<br>
The white solids obtained in step (2) and the re-<br>
sidual viscous liquid which remained in the flask after<br>
the distillation performed in step (2), were charged<br>
into a 200-ml autoclave (manufactured and sold by Toyo<br>
Koatsu Co., Ltd., Japan). Further, 51.1 g (500 mmol)<br>
of hexanol (manufactured and sold by Aldrich, U.S.A.; a<br>
dehydrated grade) was charged into the autoclave, and<br>
the autoclave was sealed. The atmosphere in the auto-<br>
clave was purged with nitrogen gas. Then, stirring of<br>
the contents of the autoclave was started, and the in-<br>
ternal temperature of the autoclave was elevated to<br>
160 °C. Then, the stirring was continued for about 30<br>
minutes. Thereafter, the purge line of the autoclave<br><br>
was opened, and water and hexanol were distilled off<br>
through the purge line over 4 hours while blowing a<br>
small amount of nitrogen gas into the bottom of the<br>
autoclave. After that period, there was almost no dis-<br>
tillate any more. Then, the inside of the autoclave<br>
was cooled to about 30°C, and there was obtained a re-<br>
action mixture. 1H-, 13C- and 119Sn-NMR analyses of the<br>
reaction mixture was performed. The NMR analyses<br>
showed that the reaction mixture contained about 40<br>
mmol of 1,1,3,3-tetrabutyl-l,3-di-hexyloxy-di-<br>
stannoxane, about 7 mmol of dibutyltin dihexyloxide and<br>
about 4 mmol of tributyltin hexyloxide.<br>
After step (3), step (1) was performed as follows.<br>
Into the above-mentioned autoclave in which step<br>
(3) was performed was charged 61.5 g (602 mmol) of hex-<br>
anol (manufactured and sold by Aldrich, U.S.A.; a dehy-<br>
drated grade). The autoclave was sealed. Then, from a<br>
carbon dioxide gas bomb which was connected to the<br>
autoclave through a SUS tube and a valve, carbon diox-<br>
ide gas having a pressure of 5 MPa was introduced into<br>
the autoclave. Stirring of the contents of the auto-<br>
clave was started. 10 Minutes after the start of the<br>
stirring, the valve of the carbon dioxide gas bomb was<br>
closed. Then, the internal temperature of the auto-<br><br>
clave was elevated to 180°C while stirring. In this<br>
instant, the internal pressure of the autoclave was<br>
about 7.5 MPa. Then, a reaction was performed for 6<br>
hours while maintaining the internal pressure of the<br>
autoclave at about 7.5 MPa. Thereafter, the inside of<br>
the autoclave was cooled to about 30 ° C and the inter-<br>
nal pressure of the autoclave was returned to atmos-<br>
pheric pressure by gently purging the carbon dioxide<br>
gas through the purge line, and there was obtained a<br>
transparent reaction mixture. In the reaction mixture,<br>
dihexyl carbonate was obtained in a yield of 14 %.<br>
After step (1), 10 g of hexanol containing 1 % of<br>
water was gently added to the reaction mixture obtained<br>
in step (1), and the resultant mixture was stirred for<br>
about 1 minute. Then, the autoclave was opened, and it<br>
was found that the mixture in the autoclave had turned<br>
into a white slurry. The white slurry was subjected to<br>
filtration using a membrane filter (H020A142C. manufac-<br>
tured and sold by Advantec Toyo Kaisha, Ltd., Japan) to<br>
thereby obtain white solids and a filtrate. The white<br>
solids were washed 2 times with 20 ml of hexanol. The<br>
filtrate was transferred into a 1-liter eggplant-shaped<br>
flask and subjected to a distillation under heating in<br>
an oil bath at 160 "C and under reduced pressure. The<br><br>
resultant flask was subjected to distillation under<br>
heating and under reduced pressure. By the distilla-<br>
tion, hexanol, tributyltin hexyloxide and dihexyl car-<br>
bonate were recovered as a distillate. The yield of<br>
dihexyl carbonate was 13 %. It was found that the dis-<br>
tillate contained about 2 mmol of tributyltin hexylox-<br>
ide.<br>
Example 3<br>
First, a reactive organometal compound having a 3<br>
-methylbutoxy group was synthesized from dibutyltin ox-<br>
ide and 3-methyl-1-butanol as follows.<br>
Into a 1-liter four-necked flask equipped with a<br>
cooling tube (which was connected with a vacuum con-<br>
troller and a vacuum pump) and a Dean-Stark trap were<br>
charged 70.5 g (0.28 mol) of dibutyltin oxide (manufac-<br>
tured and sold by Aldrich, U.S.A.) and 502 g (5.7 mol)<br>
of 3-methyl-1-butanol (manufactured and sold by Aldrich,<br>
U.S.A.). Further, a stirrer was placed in the flask.<br>
The flask was immersed in an oil bath having a<br>
temperature of 140 °C. and the pressure in the flask<br>
was gradually reduced to about 90 kPa while stirring<br>
the contents of the flask. Then, the pressure in the<br>
flask was further reduced to 85 kPa while stirring the<br>
contents of the flask and withdrawing a distillate from<br><br>
the flask, and a reaction was performed under 85 kPa<br>
for 12 hours while further withdrawing a distillate<br>
from the flask. Subsequently, unreacted components<br>
(such as an unreacted alcohol) in the flask were dis-<br>
tilled off from the flask over 30 minutes while gradu-<br>
ally reducing the pressure in the flask to about 200 Pa.<br>
The flask was taken out from the oil bath, and the in-<br>
side of the flask was cooled. Then, nitrogen gas was<br>
introduced into the flask to elevate the pressure in<br>
the flask to atmospheric pressure. By the above<br>
-mentioned operation, 127 g of a viscous liquid was ob-<br>
tained.<br>
The distillate withdrawn from the flask was ana-<br>
lyzed. As a result, it was found that the distillate<br>
contained about 260 mmol of water. The above-obtained<br>
viscous liquid was analyzed by :H-, 13C- and 119Sn-NMR's.<br>
As a result, it was found that the viscous liquid con-<br>
tained dibutyltin bis(3-methylbutoxide), 1,1,3,3<br>
-tetrabutyl-1,3-di(3-methylbutoxy)distannoxane and<br>
tributyltin(3-methylbutoxide).<br>
Step (1)<br>
114 g of the above-obtained viscous liquid was<br>
charged into a 200-ml autoclave (manufactured and sold<br>
by Toyo Koatsu Co., Ltd., Japan) which had a carbon di-<br><br>
oxide gas bomb connected thereto through a SUS tube and<br>
a valve. The autoclave was sealed, and the atmosphere<br>
in the autoclave was purged with nitrogen gas. Then,<br>
the above-mentioned valve was opened to introduce car-<br>
bon dioxide gas having a pressure of 5 MPa into the<br>
autoclave. The introduction of carbon dioxide gas into<br>
the autoclave was performed for 10 minutes while stir-<br>
ring the contents of the autoclave, and, then, stopped<br>
by closing the valve of the carbon dioxide gas bomb.<br>
Subsequently, the internal temperature of the autoclave<br>
was elevated to 120 °C while stirring. Then, a reac-<br>
tion was performed for 4 hours while maintaining the<br>
internal pressure of the autoclave at about 4 MPa.<br>
During and after the reaction, samples of the re-<br>
action mixture in the autoclave were taken out and ana-<br>
lyzed. As a result, it was found that the reaction<br>
mixture obtained 1 hour after the start of the reaction<br>
contained di(3-methylbutyl) carbonate in a yield of<br>
18 %, and that the reaction mixture obtained 4 hours<br>
after the start of the reaction contained di(3<br>
-methylbutyl) carbonate in a yield of 20.4 %.<br>
After the reaction, the inside of the autoclave<br>
was allowed to cool, and carbon dioxide gas was purged<br>
therefrom.<br><br>
Step (2)<br>
After step (1), the contents of the autoclave were<br>
allowed to cool to room temperature (about 20 °C) .<br>
Then, the autoclave was opened to recover the reaction<br>
mixture therefrom. The reaction mixture was charged<br>
into a 300-ml eggplant-shaped flask equipped with a<br>
cooling tube, a vacuum pump and a vacuum controller<br>
(manufactured and sold by Okano Works, Ltd., Japan).<br>
Further, a stirrer was placed in the flask. Then, the<br>
flask was immersed in an oil bath having a temperature<br>
of 140 °C.<br>
A distillation was performed at 140 °C while stir-<br>
ring the contents of the flask and gradually reducing<br>
the pressure in the flask. During the distillation, 3<br>
-methyl-1-butanol was first distilled off from the<br>
flask and, then, di(3-methylbutyl) carbonate was dis-<br>
tilled off from the flask. By the distillation, about<br>
9 g of di(3-methylbutyl) carbonate and about 1 mmol of<br>
tributyltin(3-methylbutoxide) were obtained.<br>
Step (3)<br>
Into a 1-liter four-necked flask equipped with a<br>
cooling tube (which was connected with a vacuum con-<br>
troller and a vacuum pump) and a Dean-Stark trap were<br>
charged the distillation residue obtained in step (2)<br><br>
above and 502 g (5.7 mol) of 3-methyl-1-butanol (manu-<br>
factured and sold by Aldrich, U.S.A.). Further, a<br>
stirrer was placed in the flask.<br>
The flask was immersed in an oil bath having a<br>
temperature of 140 °C, and the pressure in the flask<br>
was gradually reduced to about 90 kPa while stirring<br>
the contents of the flask. Then, the pressure in the<br>
flask was further reduced to 85 kPa while stirring the<br>
contents of the flask and withdrawing a distillate from<br>
the flask, and a reaction was performed under 85 kPa<br>
for 20 hours while further withdrawing a distillate<br>
from the flask. Thereafter, unreacted components (such<br>
as an unreacted alcohol) in the flask were distilled<br>
off from the flask over 30 minutes while gradually re-<br>
ducing the pressure in the flask to about 200 Pa,<br>
thereby obtaining a reaction mixture. The reaction<br>
mixture was analyzed by 1H-, 13C- and 119Sn-NMR's. As<br>
a result, it was found that the reaction mixture con-<br>
tained dibutyltin bis(3-methylbutoxide) and 1,1,3,3<br>
-tetrabutyl-1,3-di(3-methylbutoxy)distannoxane. Fur-<br>
ther, the reaction mixture also contained about 2 mmol<br>
of tributyltin(3-methylbutoxide) . Subsequently, the<br>
temperature of the oil bath was lowered so that the in-<br>
ternal temperature of the flask became about 9 3 °C, and<br>
a distillate was removed from the flask under a pres-<br><br>
sure of 50 Pa. Then, the flask was taken out from the<br>
oil bath, and the inside of the flask was cooled. Then,<br>
nitrogen gas was introduced into the flask to elevate<br>
the pressure in the flask to atmospheric pressure. By<br>
this operation, 110 g of a viscous liquid was obtained.<br>
The above-obtained viscous liquid was analyzed by<br>
1H-, 13C- and 119Sn-NMR's. As a result, it was found<br>
that the viscous liquid contained dibutyltin bis(3<br>
-methylbutoxide) and 1,1,3,3-tetrabutyl-l,3-di(3<br>
-methylbutoxy)distannoxane. It was also found that<br>
about 1 mmol of tributyltin(3-methylbutoxide) was dis-<br>
tilled off.<br>
Step (1)<br>
112 g of the above-obtained viscous liquid was<br>
charged into a 200-ml autoclave (manufactured and sold<br>
by Toyo Koatsu Co., Ltd., Japan) which had a carbon di-<br>
oxide gas bomb connected thereto through a SUS tube and<br>
a valve. The autoclave was sealed, and the atmosphere<br>
in the autoclave was purged with nitrogen gas. Then,<br>
the above-mentioned valve was opened to introduce car-<br>
bon dioxide gas having a pressure of 5 MPa into the<br>
autoclave. The introduction of carbon dioxide gas into<br>
the autoclave was performed for 10 minutes while stir-<br>
ring the contents of the autoclave, and, then, stopped<br><br>
by closing the valve of the carbon dioxide gas bomb.<br>
Subsequently, the internal temperature of the autoclave<br>
was elevated to 120 °C while stirring. Then, a reac-<br>
tion was performed for 4 hours while maintaining the<br>
internal pressure of the autoclave at about 4 MPa.<br>
During and after the reaction, samples of the re-<br>
action mixture in the autoclave were taken out and ana-<br>
lyzed. As a result, it was found that the reaction<br>
mixture obtained 1 hour after the start of the reaction<br>
contained di(3-methylbutyl) carbonate in a yield of<br>
18 %, and that the reaction mixture obtained 4 hours<br>
after the start of the reaction contained di(3<br>
-methylbutyl) carbonate in a yield of 20.4 %.<br>
After the reaction, the inside of the autoclave<br>
was allowed to cool, and carbon dioxide gas was purged<br>
therefrom.<br>
Step (2)<br>
After step (1), the contents of the autoclave were<br>
allowed to cool to room temperature (about 20 °C) .<br>
Then, the autoclave was opened to recover the reaction<br>
mixture therefrom. The reaction mixture was charged<br>
into a 300-ml eggplant-shaped flask equipped with a<br>
cooling tube, a vacuum pump and a vacuum controller<br>
(manufactured and sold by Okano Works, Ltd., Japan).<br><br>
Further, a stirrer was placed in the flask. Then, the<br>
flask was immersed in an oil bath having a temperature<br>
of 140 °C.<br>
A distillation was performed at 140 °C while stir-<br>
ring the contents of the flask and gradually reducing<br>
the pressure in the flask. During the distillation, 3<br>
-methyl-1-butanol was first distilled off from the<br>
flask and, then, di(3-methylbutyl) carbonate was dis-<br>
tilled off from the flask. By the distillation, about<br>
9 g of di(3-methylbutyl) carbonate and about 1 mmol of<br>
tributyltin(3-methylbutoxide) were obtained.<br>
Step (3)<br>
Into a 1-liter four-necked flask equipped with a<br>
cooling tube (which was connected with a vacuum con-<br>
troller and a vacuum pump) and a Dean-Stark trap were<br>
charged the distillation residue obtained in step (2)<br>
above, 502 g (5.7 mol) of 3-methyl-l-butanol (manufac-<br>
tured and sold by Aldrich, U.S.A.) and 1 g (4 mmol) of<br>
dibutyltin oxide. Further, a stirrer was placed in the<br>
flask.<br>
The flask was immersed in an oil bath having a<br>
temperature of 140 °C, and the pressure in the flask<br>
was gradually reduced to about 90 kPa while stirring<br>
the contents of the flask. Then, the pressure in the<br><br>
flask was further reduced to 85 kPa while stirring the<br>
contents of the flask and withdrawing a distillate from<br>
the flask, and a reaction was performed under 85 kPa<br>
for 20 hours while further withdrawing a distillate<br>
from the flask. Thereafter, unreacted components (such<br>
as an unreacted alcohol) in the flask were distilled<br>
off from the flask over 30 minutes while gradually re-<br>
ducing the pressure in the flask to about 200 Pa,<br>
thereby obtaining a viscous reaction mixture. The vis-<br>
cous reaction mixture was analyzed by 1H-, 13C- and<br>
119Sn-NMR's. As a result, it was found that the reac-<br>
tion mixture contained dibutyltin bis(3-methylbutoxide)<br>
and 1,l,3,3-tetrabutyl-l,3-di(3-<br>
methylbutoxy)distannoxane. Further, the reaction mix-<br>
ture also contained about 2 mmol of tributyltin(3<br>
-methylbutoxide). Subsequently, the temperature of the<br>
oil bath was lowered so that the internal temperature<br>
of the flask became about 93 oC, and a distillate was<br>
removed from the flask under a pressure of 50 Pa. The<br>
flask was taken out from the oil bath, and the inside<br>
of the flask was cooled. Then, nitrogen gas was intro-<br>
duced into the flask to elevate the pressure in the<br>
flask to atmospheric pressure. By this operation, 110<br>
g of a viscous liquid was obtained.<br>
The above-obtained viscous liquid was analyzed by<br><br>
1H-, 13C- and 119Sn-NMR's. As a result, it was found<br>
that the viscous liquid contained dibutyltin bis(3<br>
-methylbutoxide) and 1,1,3,3-tetrabutyl-l,3-di(3<br>
-methylbutoxy)distannoxane. It was also found that<br>

INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
By the method of the present invention, a carbonic<br>
ester can be produced in high yield from an organometal<br>
compound having in its molecule at least two metal<br>
-oxygen-carbon linkages and carbon dioxide. It is ad-<br>
vantageous that carbon dioxide has neither toxicity nor<br>
corrosiveness and is inexpensive. Further, the method<br>
of the present invention is advantageous not only in<br>
that the organometal compound after use in this method<br>
can be regenerated and recycled in the method, but also<br>
in that an unregenerable unreactive organometal com-<br>
pound formed can be removed from the reaction system,<br>
thereby realizing an effective and stable production of<br>
a carbonic ester. Further, there is no need for the<br>
use of a large amount of a dehydrating agent, thereby<br>
preventing occurrence of wastes derived from the dehy-<br>
drating agent. Therefore, the method of the present<br>
invention is commercially very useful and has high com-<br>
mercial value.<br><br>
