A MICROWAVE OVEN INCORPORATING A TOASTER<br>
This application claims the benefit of the Korean Application No. 2002-2130 filed on January 14, 2002, which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes as If* fully set forth herein.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a microwave oven, and more particularly, to a microwave oven incorporating a toaster. Discussion of the Related Art<br>
Generally, microwave ovens such as those illustrated in Figure 1, heat objects (e.g., food) by applying microwaves to them. Referring to Figure 1, microwave ovens include a cavity 2, in which an object may be heated by microwaves.   The cavity 2 is formed in an interior of a cavity assembly 1 and may be opened or closed via a cavity door 4.    Microwaves may be generated by various electrical devices accommodated, with an electrical device chamber 10 provided near the cavity 2.

WO 03/056988<br><br>
PCT/IOR02/02110<br><br>
-10-<br>
In one aspect of the present invention,the tray support 70 stably moves along directions dictated by a pair of moving slots 54 provided within sidewalls of the toaster case 50 and oriented along a direction parallel to the bottom edge of the toaster case sidewalls.    The tray support 70 may include two connecting parts 71 provided on left and right sides of the tray support 70.   Bushing 72. may be provided at ends of each connecting parts 71 and inserted Into a respective one of a moving slots 54.    In one aspect of the present invention, each bushing 72 supports the tray support 70 and has a shape allowing it to move within the moving slot 54 while preventing the tray support 70 from rotating while the bushing 72 is moving.    For example, a portion of bushing 72 that is to be inserted into the moving slot 54 has a hexahedron-shape.    By preventing the tray support 70 from rotating, the trays 74 may always be kept parallel to the orientation of the moving slots 54.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, the tray support 70 may be the same width as a frontal width of the toaster case 50.    Accordingly, when the tray support 70 moves forward, toward the case front-plate 51, the tray support 70 may be locked to a lower portion of a case front plate 51 such that the tray support 70 does not project out from the case front plate 51.    When the toaster door 40 is completely opened, however, a predetermined portion of each tray 74 may be projected out from each case and toaster openings 52 and 62.<br>
Lever slots 64 and 51a may be formed at bottom portions of toaster front 60 and case front plate 51, respectively. A first end of the connecting lever 16 may rotatably coupled to the bushing 72, and a second end of the connecting lever 16 may be rotatably coupled to the toaster door 40. Therefore, the connecting lever 16 may mechanically couple bushings 72 to the toaster door 40 by moving within lever slots 64<br><br>
WO 03/056988	PCT7KR02/02110<br>
-11-and 51a.    By coupling the tray support to the toaster door 40 via the connecting lever<br>
76, the tray support 70 may be moved in by rotating the toaster door 40 about the axis<br>
formed by the hinge pins 42.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, the link mechanism further includes an elastic member 79, (e.g., spring, elastic material, etc.) between the connecting lever 76 and the toaster case 50. The elastic member 79 couples the first end of the connecting lever 76 to a rear end of the toaster case 50.<br>
Referring to Figures 4 and 5, a first end of the elastic member 79 is connected to the first end of the connecting lever 76 and a second end of the elastic member 79 is connected to the rear end of the toaster case 50. For example, the first end of the elastic member 79 may be coupled to spring hook 77 formed at the first end of the connecting lever 76, while the second end of the elastic member 79 may be coupled to a spring hook 53' formed at the rear of the rear case plate 53.<br>
Accordingly, when the toaster door 40 is opened, the elastic member 79 may be extended between the spring hooks 77 and 53'. When the toaster door 40 is closed, the elastic member 79 exerts a restoring force on the first end of the connecting lever 76 such that the toaster door 40 becomes closed.<br>
Whenever the toaster door 40 is opened or closed via the aforementioned link.<br>
mechanism, the tray 74 is either inserted into or removed from the toaster case 50.<br>
and case Accordingly, whenever toaster/openings; 62 and 52 become opened or closed, the<br>
food item arranged on the tray 74 is either inserted into or removed from the toaster<br>
case 50.<br>
The operation of the microwave oven incorporating a toaster according to the<br><br>
WO 03/056988	PCT/KR02/02110<br>
-12-<br>
present invention will now be described in detail.<br>
Referring to Figure 4, for the sake of explanation only, it will be assumed that the openings 52 and 62 are closed by the toaster door 40 provided at the front of the toaster panel 32.<br>
If the user pulls the door handle 43 (e.g., after toasting of the food item is complete) and opens the toaster door 40, the toaster door rotates about an axis formed by the hinge pins 42 and hinge holes 34 and is thus opened as shown in Figure 5. At the same time, the connecting lever 76 is pulled by the toaster door 40, overcomes a restoring force provided by the elastic member 79, becomes projected out through the lever slots 51a and 64, and moves the bushing 72 along and within the moving slot 54 such that the bushing 72 moves the tray support 70 in a direction toward the front end of the toaster case 50.<br>
Subsequently, one portion of the tray 74, secured to the tray support 70, projects out from the entrance 62 at a predetermined distance. Accordingly, a food item, B, arranged on the tray 74 is removed from the toaster case 50 due to the rotation of the toaster door 40 and a user may easily remove out the food item, B, without being burned.<br>
Still referring to Figures 4 and 5, the support flange 75 supports the backside of the food item, B. In one aspect of the present invention, the support flange 75 may be pulled on to push a food item out from inside the toaster case 50 if the food item were to get stuck at the case entrance 52 of the case front plate 51. For example, food item B may get stuck at the case entrance 52 if, for example, it were to lean slightly on the tray 74.<br><br>
AVO 03/056988	PCT/KR02/02110<br>
-13-According to the principles of the present invention, the tray of the toaster may<br>
be automatically inserted into or removed from the toaster case upon opening or<br>
closing the toaster door.    Additionally, the rear flange of the tray may support the<br>
backside of a food item to be toasted and may be pulled on to push out a food item that<br>
becomes stuck within the toaster.    Accordingly, the microwave oven incorporating a<br>
toaster of the present invention facilitates the ease with which a food item may be<br>
removed from a toaster case, thereby improving the safety and ease of use of the<br>
product.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the inventions. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.<br>
