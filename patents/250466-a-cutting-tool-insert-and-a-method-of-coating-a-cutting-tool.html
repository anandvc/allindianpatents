				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
At the present time, most cutting inserts comprise substrates made from<br>
cemented carbides because cemented carbides have a high degree of toughness and<br>
good wear resistance. However, the use of cutting tools and cutting inserts ("ceramic<br>
tools") having ceramic substrates is increasing. These ceramic tools find use in a wide<br>
range of high-speed finishing operations and for the machining of difficult-to-machine<br>
materials at a high removal rate. The increase in use of ceramic tools may be due to<br>
improvements in alloyed ceramics and ceramic-matrix composites, as well as with the<br>
advances in ceramic processing technology. The ceramics used in cutting tools are<br>
typically inorganic, nonmetallic materials.<br>
The production of ceramic tools typically involves the consolidation and<br>
sintering of powdered ceramics. Sintering provides the necessary densification of the<br>
consolidated powder and may optionally be performed under pressure. In pressureless<br>
sintering, the powder is first shaped into a green, or unsintered, body which may then be<br>
sintered to achieve the necessary densification. Hot pressing of ceramics involves heating<br>
along with simultaneous uniaxial pressing of the powder in a die. Although hot-pressed<br>
ceramics are more expensive, they may be prepared with a finer grain size, a higher<br>
density and higher transverse rupture strength than cold-pressed materials.<br>
The ceramics currently used in cutting tools are based either on aluminum<br>
oxide (alumina, Al2O3) or silicon nitride (Si3N4). Other ceramics, such as, magnesia, yttria,<br>
zirconia, chromium oxide', and titanium carbide may be used as additives to aid sintering or<br>
to form alloyed ceramics with improved thermo-mechanical properties.<br>
A ceramic tool comprising an aluminum oxide substrate may be used in<br>
metal machining with high cutting speed due to the chemical inertness and great strength<br>
of the aluminum oxide substrate. Commercially significant aluminum oxide ceramic tools<br>
were basically fine grained (less than 5 µm) AI2O3 with magnesia added as a sintering aid<br>
and grain growth inhibitor. Aluminum oxide ceramics may also be alloyed with suboxides<br>
or titanium or chromium to form solid solutions. The three main commercially available<br>
aluminum oxide based tool materials are Al2O3/Ti, AI2O3/Z1-O2, and Al203 reinforced with<br>
silicon carbide (SiC) whiskers. Other Al203 base ceramics may have additives of TiN, TiB2,<br>
Ti(C,N), and Zr(C,N).<br>
Alumina-zirconia (AI2O3/Z1-O2) is an alloyed ceramic. The addition of<br>
zirconium oxide increases the higher fracture toughness and thermal shock resistance of<br>
an aluminum oxide substrate. The toughening of aluminum oxide with zirconium oxide<br>
exploits a specific crystallographic change, a martensitic type transformation, that results<br>
from an energy absorbing mechanism. The presence of metastable tetraorthoganol ZrO2<br>
provides the potential for transformation under stress into a stable monoclinic structure.<br>
The transformation acts as a stress absorber and prevents, even when cracks exist, further<br>
cracking.<br>
Typically, the zirconia oxide particles are concentrated at the aluminum<br>
oxide grain boundaries. Although fracture is intergranular, the presence of these particles<br>
is believed to provide additional toughness before failure can occur by fracture. The three<br>
most popular compositions contain 10, 25, and 40 weight % (wt.%) ZrO2 with the remainder<br>
being aluminum oxide. The 40 wt.% ZrO2 composition is close to the eutectic<br>
concentration. The higher ZrO2 compositions are less hard but tougher.<br>
Cutting inserts may be coated to increase their resistance to wear. Single or<br>
multiple layers of coatings by chemical vapor deposition ("CVD") or physical vapor<br>
deposition ("CVD") may be applied to cutting tool. Titanium nitride (TiN), titanium carbon<br>
nitride (TiCN) and aluminum oxide (AI2O3) are among the most popular CVD coating<br>
materials for carbide-based cutting tools. Thin coatings (2 µm to 5 µm) on ceramic<br>
substrates have been developed primarily to limit chemical interactions between the tool<br>
and the work material and improve wear resistance. Examples of the very recent research<br>
efforts in applying the latest CVD coating technologies to ceramic cutting inserts include<br>
coated reinforced ceramic cutting tools, United States Patent No. 6,447,896; coated silicon<br>
nitride ceramic cutting tools, United States Patent Application No. 2002/0076284; coated<br>
composite ceramic cutting inserts containing a hard phase dispersed with an alumina<br>
matrix phase, Published United States Patent Application No. 2002/0054794.<br>
There is a need to develop new coating technologies for ceramic tools in<br>
order to further improve the wear and chemical resistance of ceramic tools to meet the<br>
ever-increasing demands on machining productivity.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates cutting tools comprising a substrate<br>
comprising aluminum oxide and zirconium oxide, and a diffusion bonding enhanced layer.<br>
The diffusion bonding enhanced layer results from the reaction between reagents and at<br>
least one of the zirconium oxide and aluminum oxide in the substrate. The diffusion<br>
bonding enhanced layer may comprise nitrides of zirconium and nitrides of aluminum and<br>
the presence of these compounds enhances the adhesion of subsequent coatings.<br>
Therefore, the diffusion bonding enhanced layer may be used as an intermediate layer<br>
between the substrate and a wear resistant coating. The presence of a diffusion bonding<br>
enhanced layer may significantly improve the tool life of coated Al203 ceramic cutting<br>
inserts. An embodiment of the present invention results in a chemical reaction between at<br>
least one of the aluminum oxide and the zirconium oxide of the substrate and a mixture of<br>
nitrogen (N2) and aluminum chloride (AICI3) in a surface region. The reaction may be<br>
between a gaseous mixture of N2 and AICI3 and the components of the substrate. Single<br>
or mu.ltiple wear resistant coatings may be applied by a known coating means, including,<br>
but not limited to, CVD and PVD.<br>
The thickness of the diffusion bonded enhanced layer depends on the<br>
diffusion of the reactants into the substrate. Diffusion is the process by which molecules<br>
intermingle as a result of their kinetic energy of random motion, or in other words, it is the<br>
result of random motion of the individual atoms in a surface region of the substrate, i.e. the<br>
aluminum oxide with zirconium oxide ceramic substrate in this invention. At a relatively<br>
high temperature, the rate of diffusion increases and, therefore, certain reactants may be<br>
chemically bonded to a surface region at a certain depth into the substrate. The diffusion<br>
bonding enhanced layer does not intend to function as a wear resistant coating, rather as<br>
an intermediate layer between the ceramic substrate and the refractory metals-based CVD<br>
coatings to increase adherence. Experiments have shown consistently that the direct<br>
application of CVD coatings on the aluminum oxide with zirconium oxide ceramic substrate<br>
often does not result in good adhesion. The coatings typically peel and crack during the<br>
machining process resulting in a short service life of the ceramic tool.<br>
The diffusion bonding enhanced layer provided in this invention may be<br>
relatively uniform, stable and highly adherent layer to the ceramic substrate. It is believed<br>
that the diffusion bonding enhanced layer comprises the products of a reaction between<br>
nitrogen and aluminum chloride, and the zirconium oxide present in the substrate. The<br>
thickness of the diffusion bonding enhanced layer may be controlled by adjusting at least<br>
one of the temperature, pressure, reaction time, surface roughness of the substrate, as<br>
well as other parameters to produce the desired thickness of the coating.<br>
Embodiments of the cutting tool of the present invention comprise a<br>
substrate comprising aluminum oxide and zirconium oxide. Typically, such presently<br>
commercially available substrates comprise, by weight, from 0.5 to 45 % zirconium oxide.<br>
In certain embodiments, such as where a harder substrate may be desired, the substrate<br>
may comprise, by weight, from 0.5 to 26 % zirconium oxide or preferably, from 2 to 26 %<br>
zirconium oxide, or more preferably from 9 to 11 % zirconium oxide.<br>
Embodiments of the cutting tool may comprise single or multiple wear<br>
resistant or chemical resistant coatings, together referred to herein as "wear resistant<br>
coatings." The single or multiple wear resistant coatings on a diffusion enhanced bonding<br>
layer as a bonding interface intermediate the first wear resistant coating and coatings and<br>
the substrate, results in enhanced adhesive performance of coating and the aluminum<br>
oxide with zirconium oxide ceramic substrate is enhanced. The cutting tool may comprise<br>
any coating capable of being deposited by CVD or PVD. More particularly, the wear<br>
resistant coatings may independently comprise at least one of a metal carbide, a metal<br>
nitride, a metal carbonitride, a metal silicon and a metal oxide of a metal selected from<br>
groups II1A, IVB, VB, and V1B of the periodic table or combination thereof, such as, but not<br>
limited to, titanium nitride (TiN), titanium carbonitride (TiCN), titanium aluminum nitride<br>
(TiAIN), titanium aluminum nitride plus carbon (TiAIN+C), aluminum titanium nitride (AITiN),<br>
aluminum titanium nitride plus carbon (AITiN+C), titanium aluminum nitride plus tungsten<br>
carbide/carbon (TiAIN+WC/C), aluminum titanium nitride plus tungsten carbide/carbon<br>
(AITiN+WC/C), aluminum oxide (Al203), titanium diboride (TiB2), tungsten carbide carbon<br>
(WC/C), chromium nitride (CrN) and aluminum chromium nitride (AlCrN). A typical<br>
commercial multilayer coating for a cutting tool may comprise, for example, a first wear<br>
resistant coating of titanium nitride, a second wear resistant coating of titanium<br>
carbonitride, and the third wear resistant coating of titanium nitride.<br>
The thickness of each wear resistant coating may be any thickness desired<br>
for the specific machining application or the material to be machined. The total thickness<br>
of the coating on the surface of the substrate will typically be from about 1 to about 20<br>
micrometers or more typically from 1 to 5 micrometers. Individual wear resistant coatings,<br>
typically, may have a thickness of from 0.25 to 2 micrometers.<br>
Embodiments of the cutting tools of the invention may also comprise a<br>
substrate, wherein the substrate comprises aluminum oxide and zirconium oxide, an<br>
intermediate layer comprising nitrides of zirconium, zirconium oxide and nitrides of<br>
aluminum, and at least one wear resistant coating.<br>
The present invention also relates to a method of coating a cutting tool.<br>
Embodiments of the method comprise exposing an substrate to aluminum chloride and<br>
nitrogen, wherein the substrate comprises aluminum oxide and zirconium oxide, and<br>
coating the substrate by at least one process selected from CVD and PVD. Embodiments<br>
of the method of the present invention include a substrate comprising, by weight, from 0.5<br>
to 45 % zirconium oxide. In certain embodiments where a harder substrate may be<br>
desired, the substrate comprises, by weight, from 0.5 to 26 % zirconium oxide or<br>
preferably, by weight, from 2 to 26 % zirconium oxide, or more preferably, by weight, from<br>
9 to 11 % zirconium oxide.<br>
The substrate may be exposed to a gaseous mixture comprising aluminum<br>
chloride and nitrogen. The gaseous mixture may comprise an aluminum chloride<br>
concentration from 25% to 99% by weight or more preferably, from 75% to 99% by weight.<br>
The gaseous mixture may contain other components that are inert or essentially inert, by<br>
"essentially inert" is meant that the additional components do not interfere with formation of<br>
a diffusion bonding enhanced layer. When a gaseous mixture comprising aluminum<br>
chloride and nitrogen is used to form the diffusion bonding enhanced layer any pressure<br>
may be used although higher pressures will allow more interaction between the gaseous<br>
phase and the solid phase. The pressure of gaseous mixture used in the diffusion process<br>
may be used to control the reaction for forming the diffusion enhanced layer. A higher<br>
pressure may promote a higher level of reactivity between the zirconium oxide and<br>
nitrogen. Therefore, to provide the appropriate control, it may be preferable to maintain a<br>
pressure from 200 millibar to 1500 millibar or even a pressure from 400 millibar to 1000<br>
millibar.<br>
Diffusion may occur in a solid at any temperature. Either the gaseous<br>
mixture or the substrate may be heated to increase the rate of diffusion. Higher<br>
temperatures may result in a higher rate of diffusion but the operating temperatures should<br>
not be so high as to cause any undesired changes in the solid substrate. Therefore, for<br>
substrates comprising aluminum oxide and zirconium oxide, it may be preferred that the<br>
gaseous mixture or the substrate is at a temperature from 50°C to 1400°C or from 50°C to<br>
1200"C. More narrow temperature ranges may be desired to maintain a commercially<br>
acceptable rate of diffusion and not affect the substrate, therefore, it may be desired to<br>
have a temperature of the gaseous mixture or the substrate from 500°C to 1200°C or more<br>
preferably from 10008C to 1200°C.<br>
Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of<br>
ingredients, time, temperatures, and so forth used in the present specification and claims<br>
are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term "about." Accordingly,<br>
unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the following<br>
specification and claims are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired<br>
properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least, and not as an<br>
attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims,<br>
each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported<br>
significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques.<br>
Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the<br>
broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the<br>
specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however,<br>
may inherently contain certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation<br>
found in their respective testing measurements.<br>
EXAMPLES OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The following examples demonstrate the formation of diffusion bonding<br>
enhanced layer on the substrate comprising aluminum oxide and zirconium oxide and the<br>
increased adherence of the wear resistant coatings on the substrate. The ceramic<br>
substrate of this example comprised in weight percentage, 90% Al203 and 10% ZrO2. The<br>
substrate had a density of 4.0 g/cm3, a hardness of 1800 Hv, a toughness of 4.5 MN/m3/2,<br>
and a heat transfer coefficient of 0.07 cal/cm.sec °C.<br>
The substrate was exposed to a gaseous mixture comprising aluminum<br>
chloride and nitrogen under a pressure of 500 millibar. The substrate was heated to a<br>
temperature of approximately 1020°C. The ratio of AICI3/N2 in the gaseous mixture was<br>
approximately 7.<br>
Figure 1 is a photomicrograph taken at 1000X magnification of a prepared<br>
cross-section of a cutting tool 10 of the present invention at a perspective view showing the<br>
edge 11 between the top 12 and the cross-sectional face 13. The diffusion bonding<br>
enhanced layer 14 is clearly shown on the substrate 15 after exposure to the gaseous<br>
mixture. As may be seen in Figure 1, the diffusion bonding enhanced layer 14 is formed<br>
evenly across the surface of the substrate 15. The thickness of the diffusion-bonding layer<br>
14 on the substrate 15 of Figure 1 is about half micrometer (0.5 micrometer).<br>
Figure 2A and 2B are photomicrographs taken at a magnification of 1000X<br>
of cross-sections of coated Al2O3/ZrO2 ceramic substrate on which multiple wear resistant<br>
coatings were applied. Figure 2A shows a photomicrograph of a cross-section of a coated<br>
ceramic substrate 20 having a first coating of TiN 22, a second coating of TiCN 23, and a<br>
third coating of TiN 24 applied directly on the substrate 21 without an intermediate diffusion<br>
bonding enhanced layer. Figure 2B shows a photomicrograph of a cross-section of a<br>
coated ceramic substrate 25 with a diffusion bonding enhanced layer 30 between the first<br>
coating of TIN 27 coating and the substrate 26. The coated ceramic substrate 25 also has<br>
a second coating of TiCN 28 and a third coating of TiN 29. As may be seen in Figure 2A,<br>
the first coating of TiN 22 neither adheres well nor distributes uniformly across the<br>
AlsO3/ZrO2 ceramic substrate 21, the poor adherence may be evidenced by the dark areas<br>
31 of the photomicrograph between the first coating of TiN 22 and the substrate 21. In<br>
contrast, the diffusion bonding enhanced layer 30 has good adherence and uniform<br>
distribution on both the first coating of TiN 27 and the substrate 26. The multiple coatings<br>
shown in both substrates 20 and 25 of Figures 2A and 2B are TiN-TiCN-TiN all deposited<br>
by CVD with a total thickness of 3 micrometers The diffusion bonding enhanced layer<br>
formed on the base Al203/ZrO2 ceramic substrate 26 may be composed of various<br>
chemical elements or compounds, including zirconium nitride, zirconium oxide, and<br>
aluminum nitride, that are melted together in a fashion to produce a uniform distribution of<br>
the mixed metals.<br>
TESTING OF COATED CUTTING TOOLS<br>
Scratch Test<br>
Performance tests were conducted to determine whether a cutting tool<br>
comprising a diffusion bonding enhanced layer intermediate to the substrate and the first<br>
wear resistant coating would provide a strong adherence for the CVD or PVD coatings<br>
(single or multiple layers). Two cutting tools were prepared one with a multiple wear<br>
resistant coatings applied directly to the substrate and a second with a diffusion enhanced<br>
bonding layer intermediate to the substrate and the multiple wear resistant coatings formed<br>
by the method described above. Both cutting inserts were similarly coated with TiN-TiCN-<br>
TiN with three micrometers in thickness by CVD. Figure 3A and Figure 3B are<br>
photographs of each of the coated ceramic substrates after scratch tests were performed<br>
under a constant load of 10 kg. The cutting insert 40 of Figure 3A does not comprise a<br>
diffusion bonding enhanced layer and the cutting insert 50 of Figure 3B does comprise the<br>
diffusion bonding enhanced layer. As shown in Figure 3A, the CVD coatings 41 have<br>
peeled and chipped along the scratch mark 42 and the white ceramic surface 43 is<br>
exposed under the scratch pressure applied. In fact, the weak adhesion of the CVD<br>
coatings without a diffusion bonding enhanced bonding layer is also indicated by<br>
comparing the width scratch mark 42 in Figure 3A with the narrow scratch mark 52 in<br>
Figure 3B. The formation of a wider scratch 42 in Figure 3A is because the wear resistant<br>
coatings 41 has a low resistance to chipping and peeling from the scratch load applied<br>
during the test (same 10-kg constant pressure for both cases). While the formation of the<br>
narrow scratch mark 52 in Figure 3B is a result of the strong adherence of the CVD<br>
coatings 51 to the diffusion bonding enhanced layer between the Al2O3/ZrO2 ceramic<br>
substrate and the CVD coatings applied. The scratch test clearly indicates that the<br>
diffusion bonding enhanced layer improves adherence of the CVD coatings on the<br>
Al2O3/ZrO2 ceramic substrate.<br>
Machining Tests<br>
A series of comparative machining tests was carried out under various<br>
cutting conditions and with various work materials to demonstrate the advantages of a<br>
cutting tool comprising an intermediate diffusion bonding enhanced layer and multiple wear<br>
resistant coatings.<br>

Three Al2O3/ZrO2 ceramic cutting tools were selected for the comparative<br>
machining test - as shown in Table 1. All the cutting inserts have the same style and<br>
geometry, designated as SNEN120412, which denotes a square shape with an inscribed<br>
diameter of 12mm, a thickness of 4.76 mm, and a corner nose radius of 1.20 mm<br>
according to the ISO standard. The cutting inserts of Case 1 have a single T-Land around<br>
the cutting edges.<br><br>
The machining tests of Case 1 were performed under the following cutting<br>
conditions:<br>
Cutting speed = 1600 feet per minute (480 meters per minute)<br>
Feed rate = 0.01 inch per revolution (0.25 mm per revolution)<br>
Depth of cut = 0.020 inch (0.5 mm)<br>
Insert designated C1B was coated directly on the substrate while insert<br>
designated C1C was coated accordingly to the method of the present invention, as<br>
described above. The test results are shown in Figure 4A. It is clear that the cutting insert<br>
C1C (TiN-TiCN-TiN CVD coated) with the diffusion bonding enhanced layer demonstrated<br>
the best performance. The diffusion bonding enhanced layer resulted in more than 80%<br>
increase in tool life compared with the cutting insert C1B (TiN CVD coated), and a nearly<br>
200% increase comparing with the uncoated cutting insert C1C.<br>
Case 2: Machining of the Alloy Steels<br>
Three Al2O3/ZrO2 ceramic cutting tools were selected for the comparative<br>
machining test, as shown in Table 2. All the cutting inserts have the same style and<br>
geometry, designated as RCGX251200, which denotes a round shape with a diameter of<br>
25 mm, a side clearance angle of 7 degrees, and a thickness of 12.7 mm, according to the<br>
ISO standard. The cutting inserts of Case 2 were prepared with double T-Lands around<br>
the cutting edges.<br><br>
The machining tests of Case 2 were performed under the following test<br>
conditions:<br>
Cutting speed = 1000 feet per minute (305 meters per minute)<br>
Feed rate = 0.03 - 0.055 inch per revolution (0.76 - 1.40 mm per revolution)<br>
Depth of cut = 0.027 - 0.055 inch (0.69 -1.40 mm)<br>
The machining test results of Case 2 are shown in Figure 4B. It indicates<br>
clearly that both the cutting insert C2B with TiN CVD coating and the cutting insert C2C<br>
with TiN-TiCN-TiN CVD coating demonstrate better performance in terms of tool life than<br>
the cutting insert C2A with TiN CVD coating of the prior art.<br>
