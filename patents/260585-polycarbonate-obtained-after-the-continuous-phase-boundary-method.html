				<td>Polycarbonates having a good wettability<br>
The invention provides polycarbonates as a substrate material for the production of transparent injection mouldings, in particular for the production of injection mouldings to be coated, and mouldings obtainable from the polycarbonates according to the invention. Mouldings can be e.g. transparent sheets, lenses, optical storage media or carriers for optical storage media or also articles from the field of automotive glazing, such as e.g. light-diffusing panes. The invention provides in particular optical storage media or carriers for optical storage media, such as e.g. writable optical data stores, which have a good capacity for being coated and wetting capacity and are suitable e.g. for application of dyestuffs from solution, in particular from non-polar media. Furthermore, the optical injection mouldings of the polycarbonates according to the invention have a relatively low tendency to soil.<br>
Transparent injection mouldings are of importance above all in the field of glazing and of storage media.<br>
Optical data recording materials are increasingly being used as a variable recording and/or archiving medium for large quantities of data. Examples of this type of optical data stores are CD, super-audio CD, CD-R, CD-RW, DVD, DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD-RW, DVD+RW and BD. !<br>
Transparent thermoplastics, such as, for example, polycarbonate, polymethyl methacrylate and chemical modifications thereof, are typically employed for optical storage media. Polycarbonate as a substrate material is suitable in particular for optical disks which can be written to once and read several times and also for optical disks which can be written to several times, and for the production of mouldings from the field of automotive glazing, such as e.g. light-diffusing panes. This thermoplastic has an excellent mechanical stability, is not very susceptible to changes in dimension and is distinguished by a high transparency and impact strength.<br>
Polycarbonate prepared by the phase interface process can be used for the production of optical data stores of the formats described above, such as e.g. for compact disks (CD) or digital versatile disks (DVD). These disks often have the property of building up a high electrical field during their production in the injection moulding process. During production of the optical data store, this high field strength on the substrate leads e.g. to attraction of dust from the environment or to sticking of the injection-mounded articles, such as e.g. of the disks, to one another, which reduces the quality of the finished injection-mounded articles and makes the injection moulding process difficult.<br>
It is furthermore known that the electrostatic charging, in particular of disks (for<br>
optical data carriers), leads to a deficient wettability above all with non-polar media,<br>
such as e.g. a non-polar dyestuff, or with a dyestuff application from solvents, such<br>
as e.g. dibutyl ether, ethylcyclohexane, tetrafluoropropanol, cyclohexane,<br>
methylcyclohexane or octafluoropropanol.' A high electrical field on the surface of<br>
the substrate during dyestuff application to writable data stores thus causes, for<br>
example, an irregular coating 'With dyestuff and therefore leads to defects in the<br>
information layer.	 <br>
The extent of the electrostatic charging of a substrate material can be quantified e.g. by measurement of the electrical field at a  particular distance from the substrate surface.<br>
In the case of an optical data store in which e.g. a dyestuff component is applied to the surface in a spin coating process, a low absolute electrical field strength is necessary in order to guarantee uniform application of the writable layer and to ensure a trouble-free production process.  <br>
 Furthermore, a high electrostatic field causes losses in yield in respect of the substrate material due to the facts described above. This can lead to a halt to the particular production step and is associated with high costs.<br>
In order to solve this problem of a high static charging, several set-ups have been pursued. In general, antistatic are added to the substrate material as additives. Antistatic polycarbonate compositions are described e.g. in JP 62 207 358-A. Here, phosphoric acid derivatives, inter alia, are added to the polycarbonate as antistatics.<br>
EP 0922 728 describes various antistatics, such as polyalkylene glycol derivatives, ethoxylated sorbitan monolaurate, polysiloxane derivatives, phosphine oxides and distearylhydroxyamine, which are employed individually or as mixtures. The Japanese Application JP 62 207 358 describes esters of phosphorous acid as additives. US Patent 5,668,202 describes sulfonic acid derivatives. In WO 00/50 488, 3,5-di-tert-butylphenol is employed as a chain terminator in the phase interface process. This chain terminator leads to a lower static charging of the corresponding substrate material compared with conventional chain terminators. JP 62 207 358-A describes polyethylene derivatives and polypropylene derivatives as additives for<br>
polycarbonate.<br>
However, the additives described can also have an adverse effect on the properties of the substrate material, since they tend to escape from the material, i.e. to ... the ... the surface. This is indeed a desirable effect for the antistatic properties, but can lead to formation of a deposit or defective copying. Moreover, the content of oligomers in the polycarbonate can also lead to a poorer level of mechanical properties and to a lowering of the glass transition temperature. Furthermore, these additives may cause side reactions: The subsequent "end-capping" of polycarbonate which has been obtained from the transesterification process is expensive and the results achieved are not optimum. Introduction of new end groups into the material is associated with high costs.<br>
There is thus the object of providing a composition or a substrate material which meets the requirements of a field strength on the substrate surface which is as low as possible, and avoids the disadvantages described above.<br>
Surprisingly, the object has been achieved by employing for the production of optical data stores those materials in particular which contain as few incorrect<br>
structures, in particular as few carbamate compounds of specific structure, as possible in the low molecular weight content which are able to accumulate in a solvent extract.<br>
A certain content of carbamate compounds in the substrate material can be caused by addition of additives, by contamination of precursors or by the preparation process itself.<br>
The present invention provides polycarbonates as substrate materials, which, measured in the acetone extract by chromatography by means of HPLC, 0.2 to 300 ppm, preferably 0.2 to 250 ppm, particularly preferably 0.2 to 200 ppm, one or more compounds chosen from the formula (I)<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein<br>
R1 and R2 independently of one another denote hydrogen or C1-C12-alkyl, preferably-methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl or butyl, or<br>
R1 and R2 together denote C4-C12-alkylidene, preferably C4-C8-alkylidene, particularly prefefably'C4-C5-alkylidene,<br>
R3 and R4 independently of one another represent hydrogen, C1-C12-alkyl, preferably C1-C8-alkyl, or phenyl, or R3 and R4 with the carbon atom to which they are bonded form cyclohexyl or trimethyl cyclohexyl, and<br>
R5 denotes hydrogen, C1-C12-alkyl, C5-C12-cycloalkyl, phenyl or cumyl, preferably hydrogen, tert-butyl or cumyl.<br>
The polycarbonates according to the invention show, after processing to an injection-mounded article, preferably an optical disk, a low electrostatic charging. This is important in particular for the production of optical storage media.<br>
The polycarbonates/substrate materials according to the invention can be prepared<br>
by choosing suitable process parameters:<br>
The content of compounds of the formula 1 or 4 can be influenced by several factors. For example, the purity of the educts and auxiliary substances is important. Furthermore, process parameters such as the molar ratio of biphenyl and phosgene employed, temperatures during the reaction, reaction and dwell times, may be decisive. For the person skilled in the art, the object is to control the process such that the limits according to the invention of the carbamate content in the substrate material are not exceeded.<br>
A suitable choice of process parameters in order to obtain the desired substrate<br>
material can appear as follows:<br>
While the excess of phosgene’ used, based on the total of biphenyl’s employed, is between 3 and 100 mol%, preferably between 5 and 50 mol%, in conventional continuous polycarbonate synthesis, th6 substrate material according to the invention is prepared with phosgene excesses of 5 to 20 mol%, preferably 8 to 17 mol%. In this procedure, the pH of the aqueous phase is kept in the alkaline range, preferably between 8.5 and 12, during and after metering in of the phosgene via subsequent metering in of sodium hydroxide solution once or several times or corresponding subsequent metering in of bisphenolate solution, while it is adjusted to 10 to 14 after addition of the catalyst. The temperature during the phosgenation is 0 °C to 40 °C, preferably 5 °C to 36 °C.<br>
The polycarbonates according to the invention are prepared by the phase interface process. This process for the synthesis of polycarbonate is described in many cases in the literature; reference may be- made by way of example to H. Schnell, Chemistry<br>
and Physics of Polycarbonates, Polymer Reviews, vol. 9, Interscience Publishers, New York 1964 p. 33 et seq., to Polymer Reviews, vol. 10, "Condensation Polymers by Interfacial and Solution Methods", Paul W. Morgan, Interscience Publishers, New York 1965, chap. VIII, p. 325, to Dres. U. Gringo, K. Kircher and P. R. Muller, "Polycarbonate" in Becker/Braun, Kunststoffhandbuch, volume 3/1, Polycarbonate, Placental, Polyester, Cellulose-ester, Carl Hanser Verlag Munich, Vienna 1992, p. 118-145 and to EP-A0517 044.<br>
According to this process, the phosgenation of a disodium salt of a biphenyl (or of a mixture of various bisphenols) which has been initially introduced into an aqueous-alkaline solution (or suspension) is carried out in the presence of an inert organic solvent or solvent mixture which forms a second phase. The oligocarbonates formed, which are chiefly present in the organic phase, are subjected to a condensation reaction with the aid of suitable catalysts to give high molecular weight polycarbonates dissolved in the organic phase. Finally, the organic phase is separated off and the polycarbonate is isolated therefrom by various working up steps.<br>
Dihydroxyaryl compounds which are suitable for the preparation of polycarbonates are those of the formula (2) in which<br>
Z is an aromatic radical having 6 to 30 C atoms, which can contain one or more aromatic nuclei, can be substituted and can contain aliphatic or cycloaliphatic radicals or alkyl aryls or heteroatoms as bridge members.<br>

Preferably, X represents a single bond, C1 to Cs-alkylene, C2 to C5-alkylidene, C5 to C6-cycloalkylidene, -O-, -SO-,, -CO-, -S-, -SO2-<br>
or a radical of the formula' (3a) or (3b)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>

dihydroxydiphenyls,	bis-(hydroxyphenyl)-alkenes,	bis-(hydroxyphenyl)-<br>

These and further suitable Diphenols are described e.g. in US-A 2 999 835, 3 148 172, 2 991 273, .3 271 367,, 4 982 014 and 2 999 846, in the German Offenlegungsschriften 1 570 703, 2 063 050, 2 036 052, 2 211 956 and 3 832 396, French Patent Specification 1 561 518, in the monograph "H. Schnell, Chemistry and Physics of Polycarbonates, Interscience Publishers, New York 1964, p. 28 et seq.; p. 102 ^t seq.", and in "D. G. Legrand, J. T. Bendler, Handbook of Polycarbonate Science and Technology, Marcel Decker New York 2000, p. 72 et seq.".<br>
'      i<br>
In the case of the homopolycarbonates, only one Diphenols is employed, and in the<br>
case of co polycarbonates two of rriore Diphenols are employed. The Diphenols used,<br>
like all the other chemicals and auxiliary substances added to the synthesis, may be<br>
contaminated with the impurities originating from their own synthesis, handling and<br>
storage. However, it is desirable t6 work with raw materials which are as pure as<br>
possible.	<br>
The nonfunctional chain terminators required for regulation of the molecular weight, such as phenol or alkyl phenols, in particular phenol, p-tert-butylphenol, iso-octylphenol, cumylphenol, ehlorocarbonic acid esters thereof or acid chlorides of monocarboxylic acids or mixtures of these chain terminators, either are fed to the reaction with the bisphenolate or the bisphenolates, or are added at any desired point in time of the synthesis, as long as phosgene or ehlorocarbonic acid end groups are still present in the reaction mixture or, in the case of the acid chlorides and ehlorocarbonic acid esters as chain terminators, as long as sufficient phenolic end<br>
groups of the polymers forming are available. Preferably, however, the chain terminator or terminators are added after the phosgenation, at a position or at a point in time when phosgene is no longer present, but the catalyst has not yet been metered in, or they are metered in before the catalyst, together with the catalyst or parallel thereto.<br>
In the same manner, any branching agents or branching agent mixtures to be used are added to the synthesis, but conventionally before the chain terminators. Trisphenols, quaternary phenols or acid chlorides of tri- or tetracarboxylic acids are conventionally used, or also mixtures of the polyphenols or of the acid chlorides.<br>
Some of the compounds having three or more than three phenolic hydroxyl groups which can be used are, for example,<br>
phloroglucinol,<br>
4,6-dimethyl-2,4,6-tri-(4-hydrbxyphenyl)-hept-2-ene,<br>
4,6-dimethyl-2,4,6-tri-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-heptane,<br>
l,3,5-tri-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-benzene,<br>
1,1,1 -tri-(4-hydroxypheriyl)-ethane,<br>
tri-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-phenylrhethane,<br>
2,2-bis-[4,4-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-cyclohexyl]-propane,<br>
2,4-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl-isopropyl)-phenol and<br>
tetra-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-methane.<br>
Some of the other trifunctiohal compounds are 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, trimesic acid, cyanuric chloride and 3,3-bis-(3-methyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-oxo-2,3-dihydroindole.<br>
Preferred branching agents are 3,3-bis-(3-methyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-oxo-2,3-dihydroindole and l,l,l-tri-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethane.<br>
The catalysts used in the phase interface synthesis are tertiary amines, in particular triethylamine, tributylamine, trioctylamine, N-ethylpiperidine, N-methylpiperidine and N-i/n-propylpiperidine; quaternary ammonium salts, such as tetrabutylammonium / tributylbenzylamonium / tetraethylammonium hydroxide / chloride / bromide / hydrogen sulfate / tetrafluoroborate; and the phosphonium compounds corresponding to the ammonium compounds. These compounds are described in the literature as typical phase interface catalysts, commercially obtainable and familiar to the person skilled in the art. The catalysts can be added to the synthesis individually, in a mixture or also side by side and successively, optionally also before the phosgenation, although meterings after the introduction of phosgene are preferred, unless an onium compound or mixtures of onium compounds are used as catalysts, in which case addition before the metering in of phosgene is preferred. The metering of the catalyst or catalysts can be carried out in bulk, in an inert solvent, preferably that of the polycarbonate synthesis, or also as an aqueous solution, and in the case of the tertiary amines then as ammonium salts thereof with acids, preferably mineral acids, in particular hydrochloric acid. If several catalysts are used or part amounts of the total amount of catalyst are metered in, different methods of metering can of course also be carried out at different places or at different times. The total amount-of catalysts used is between 0.001 to 10 mol%, based on the moles of bisphenols employed, preferably 0.01 to 8 mol%, particularly preferably 0.05 to 5 mol%.<br>
The conventional additives for polycarbonates can also be added to the polycarbonates according to the invention in the conventional amounts. The addition of additives serves-to prolong the duration of use or the colour (stabilizers),<br>
to simplify processing (e.g. mould release agents, flow auxiliaries, antistatics) or to adapt the polymer properties to particular stresses (impact modifiers, such as rubbers; flameproofing agents, colorants, glass fibres).<br>
These additives can be added to the polymer melt individually or in any desired mixtures or several different mixtures, and in particular directly on isolation of the polymer or after melting of granules in a so-called compounding step. In this context, the additives or mixtures thereof can be added to the polymer melt as a solid, i.e. as a powder, or as a melt. Another type of metering is the use of master batches or mixtures of master batches of the additives or additive mixtures.<br>
Suitable additives are described, for example, in "Additives for Plastics Handbook, John Murphy, Elsevier, Oxford 1999", and in "Plastics Additives Handbook, Hans Zweifel, Hanser, Munich 2001".<br>
Preferred heat stabilizers are, for example, organic phosphates, phosphatases and phosphates, usually those in which the organic radicals consist entirely or partly of optionally substituted aromatic radicals. UV stabilizers which are employed are e.g. substituted benzotriazolyl. These and other stabilizers can be used individually or in combinations and added to the polymer in the forms mentioned.<br>
Furthermore, processing auxiliaries, such as mould release agents, usually derivatives of long-chain fatty .acids, can be added. Pentaerythritol tetrastearate and glycerol monostearate e.g. are preferred. They are employed by themselves or in a mixture, preferably in an amount of 0.02 "to 1 wt.%, based on the weight of the composition.	<br>
Suitable flame-retardant additives are phosphate esters, i.e. triphenyl phosphate, resorcinol diphosphoric acid esters, bromine-containing compounds, such as brominated phosphoric acid esters, brbminated oligocarbonates and polycarbonates, and preferably salts of flu6rinated organic sulfonic acids.<br>
Suitable impact modifiers are, for example, graft polymers comprising one or more graft bases chosen from at least one polybutadiene rubber, acrylate rubber (preferably ethyl or butyl acrylate rubber), ethylene/propylene rubbers, and grafting<br>
	.	"<br>
monomers chosen from at least one monomer from the group consisting of styrene, acrylonitrile or alkyl methacrylate (preferably methyl methacrylate), or interpenetrating siloxane and acrylate networks with grafted-on methyl methacrylate or styrene/acrylonitrile.<br>
Furthermore, colorants, such as organic dyestuffs or pigments or inorganic pigments or IR absorbers, can be added, individually, in a mixture or also in combination with stabilizers, glass fibres, glass (hollow) beads or inorganic fillers.<br>
The polycarbonates according to the invention can moreover comprise carbamate<br>
compounds of the formula (4)	<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1, R^, R3 and R4 have the meaning given for formula (1).<br>
The content of carbamate compounds of the formula (4) is measured by means of HPLC in the acetone extract after alkaline hydrolysis with sodium hydroxide solution and is in general 0.2 to 500 ppm, preferably 0.2 to 400 ppm, particularly preferably 0.2 to 300 ppm (cf. also the examples).<br>
The present Application furthermore provides the extradites and mouldings obtainable from the polycarbonates according to the invention, in particular those for use in the field of transparent products, very particularly in the field of optical uses, such as e.g. sheets, multi-wall sheets, glazing, diffuser panes, lamp covers or optical data stores, such as audio-CD, CD-R(W), DVD, DVD-R(W) and minidisks in their various only readable or once-writable and optionally also repeatedly writable embodiments.<br>
The present invention furthermore provides the use of the polycarbonates according<br>
to the invention for the production of extradites and mouldings.<br>
Further uses are, for example, but without limiting the subject matter of the present invention:<br>
1.	Safety panes, which are known to be required in many areas of buildings,<br>
vehicles and aircraft, and also as visors of helmets.<br>
2.	Films<br>

Examples<br>
The method for measurement of the carbamate content in the acetone extract is described in the following:<br>
The concentration of the carbamate bisphenols A oligomers of formula (1) in the acetone extract is determined as follows: .<br>
50 mg extract are dissolved in 50 ml acetonitrile. 10 ul of the solution are injected into the HPLC. Detection is carried out with a diode array detector (DAD), fluorescence detector (FLD) or by mass spectrometry (MS) as desired. Calibration is carried out by the external standard method (multiple point calibration).<br>
The method for measurement of the field strength on the corresponding injection molded article, this being an optical disk, is as follows:<br>
For measurement of the electrical field strength, a field meter (EMF 581230) from Eltec is used. Immediately after the end of the injection moulding process, the moulding (disk) is removed and deposited via a robot arm. During this procedure, the disk must not come into contact with metal, since otherwise the measurement is impaired. Furthermore, any ionizers present must be switched off.<br>
The field meter is positioned above the disk at a distance of 100 mm from the horizontal disk surface. The centre of the field meter is positioned such that its projection on the disk currently to be measured lies 39 mm outside the centre of the disk. The disk is not moved during this procedure. The field is measured in this way in a period of 3 to 10 seconds after conclusion of the injection moulding process.<br>
The measuring apparatus is connected to an x/y recorder, on which the particular values are printed out. Each-disk measured is thus assigned a particular integral value of the electrical field. To limit the amount of data, 100 measurements are<br>
carried out after the start of the process, i.e. the corresponding electrical field of the first 100 disks is recorded. After in’ each case 60 minutes, a further 100 measurements are performed. After the 4th measurement series, i.e. after approx. 3 hours, the measurement is stopped.<br>
When carrying out the measurement it is to be ensured that the atmospheric humidity during the measurement is 30 to'60 %, preferably 35 to 50 %, and the room temperature is 25 to 28 °C.<br>
In this method, the electrical field on the surface of the optical disk is measured by means of a probe directly after the injection moulding process. A disk is then considered difficult to write on if the electrical field exceeds a value of 18 kV/m.<br>
