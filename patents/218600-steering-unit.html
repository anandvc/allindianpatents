[0016]<br>
Next, a method of housing the electric motorcycle in a private four-wheel vehicle will be described. The electric motorcycle equivalent to this embodiment is housed in trunk space secured at the back of the backmost seat of the vehicle the height of the ceiling of the vehicle compartment of which is held to the rear of the vehicle like a so-called one box<br><br>
car or two-box vehicle in a state in which the vehicle body<br>
is shortened before and after.<br>
[0017]<br>
Fig. 3 is a perspective view viewed from the upside of the rear on the left side of the vehicle showing a state in which the electric motorcycle equivalent to this embodiment is housed in trunk space at the back of the rear seat and Fig.<br>
4	is its side view.<br>
[0018]<br>
In the trunk space secured at the back of the rear seat<br>
5	of the vehicle, a housing panel 4 is mounted.  In this<br>
embodiment, two electric motorcycles can be housed in parallel,<br>
and a wheel guidance groove 401 and a wheel pan 402 are<br>
respectively provided on the right and left sides of the housing<br>
panel 4.<br>
[0019]<br>
The backmost seat 5 is composed of the seat bearing surface 51, a seat back frame 52 and a hold bar 53 provided on both sides of the bearing surface 51 and has light structure in which no backrest and no headrest are equipped. At the backmost seat 5, the seat 203 functions as a backrest and the backrest 204 functions as a headrest respectively by raising the seat host 202 housed in the rear of the electric motorcycle forward. [0020]<br>
Next, referring to Figs. 5 to 8, the method of housing the electric motorcycle will be described. Only an outline of housing operation will be described and the structure of each<br><br>
part for realizing easy housing will be described in detail<br>
later.<br>
[0021]<br>
Fig. 5A shows an extended state in which the electric motorcycle can travel. When the electric motorcycle is housed in the trunk space, a handlebar lock described later is released and further, after right and left L-type handlebar shafts 102 are turned by 90 degrees inside, the handlebar shafts 102 are pushed downward together with the meter unit 101 as shown in Fig. 5B. [0022]<br>
Next, as shown in Fig. 6A, after a front lock described later is released, the shafts 103 (R, L) of the front frame 1 are backed along the guide rollers 302 of the center frame 3. Operation so far is performed outside the four-wheel vehicle, in this state, the body of the electric motorcycle is lifted over the housing panel 4 in the rear of the four-wheel vehicle, and the front and rear wheels are inserted into the wheel guidance groove 401. [0023]<br>
Next, as shown in Fig. 7, after a rear lock described later is released, the front wheel FW is pushed against the wheel pan 402. Further, in this state, a forward travel switch 209 provided to the swing shaft 207 is operated, the rear wheel is driven at low speed forward and the rear frame 2 is advanced.<br>
Or the vehicle body is mounted on the housing panel 4 in the trunk space in a state shown in Fig. 5B in which the<br><br>
  handlebar shafts 102 are pushed downward together with the meter unit 101 and the forward travel switch 209 may be also operated in a state in which the front wheel FW is pushed against the wheel pan 402 .  In this case, the rear frame 2 and the center frame 3 are simultaneously advanced toward the front frame 1.<br>
[0025]<br>
When the reduction of the vehicle body is completed as described above, the seat post 202 is finally raised with the swing shaft 207 in the center as shown in Figs. 6B and 8, and the seat 203 and the backrest 204 are turned to a backrest position and a headrest position of the rear seat 5.<br>
[0026]<br>
As described above, in this embodiment, as the motorcycle is composed of three frames 1, 2 and 3 and the front frame 1 and the rear frame 2 can be slid before and after for the center frame 3, the overall length of the motorcycle in a housed state can be further reduced, compared with that of a conventional type. The motorcycle can be housed in the trunk space so that the longitudinal direction is coincident with that of the four-wheel vehicle by enabling such further reduction in the longitudinal direction. Therefore, the seat 203 and the backrest 204 can function as the backrest and the headrest of the backmost seat 5 by only turning the seat post 202 of the motorcycle.<br>
[0027]<br>
That is, in this embodiment, as functional parts are shared by making the seat 203 and the backrest 204 of the electric motorcycle housed in the trunk space of the four-<br><br>
wheel vehicle function as a part of the rear seat of the four-wheel vehicle, space is saved and lightening is achieved. [0028]<br>
In this embodiment, as shown in Figs. 3 and 6B, a fastener 323 described in detail later is protruded downward from the bottom of the side component of the center frame 3 in interlock with the turning operation of the swing shaft 207, further pierces an opening 403 of the housing panel 4 and is coupled to the other fastener (not shown) equipped on the side of the vehicle body. [0029]<br>
An electric contact of a charging line is provided to the fastener 323, both are mechanically fixed by the fastening, simultaneously charging current is supplied from a power line on the side of the vehicle to the side of the electric motorcycle and the secondary battery of the electric motorcycle is charged. [0030]<br>
Next, the structure of each frame 1,2,3 and a mechanism for coupling each other will be described in detail. [0031]<br>
Fig. 9 is a development showing a main part of the center frame 3 and a mechanism for coupling it to the rear frame 2, Fig. 10 shows the skeletal structure of the center frame 3 and the same reference number denotes the same or similar part. [0032]<br>
The center frame 3 is formed by coupling a pair of right and left frame bodies 301 (R, L) arranged in parallel by a plate<br><br>
bridge 304 in a lower part of the front as described before referring to Fig. 1. The frame body 301 is in the shape of a substantially trapezoidal loop formed by coupling a substantially U-shaped front body frame 311 and a substantially U-shaped rear body frame 312 via an upper frame pipe 313 and a lower frame pipe 314 as shown in Fig. 10. [0033]<br>
As described above, in this embodiment, as the center frame 3 is formed by a pair of right and left looped frame bodies 301 (R, L) , not only the strength and the rigidity of the frame can be enhanced but it becomes easy to carry the electric motorcycle in case it is mounted on the vehicle. [0034]<br>
A pair of right and left guide rollers 302 (R, L) that support the head pipes 103 of the front frame 1 so that the head pipes can be slid are mounted in an upper part of the front side of each frame body 301 (R, L). [0035]<br>
Each side component 208 (R, L) of the rear frame 2 is provided with two openings 316 and 317 shown in Fig. 9 that pierce before and after in upper and lower parts of the side component, and the upper frame pipe 313 and the lower frame pipe 314 are inserted into the openings 316 and 317 beforehand so that the frame pipes can be slid. Hereby, the rear frame 2 is supported by the center frame 3 so that the rear frame can be slid before and after. In the side component 208 (R, L) , the swing shaft 207 is inserted into an opening 319 pierced horizontally so that the swing shaft can be swung.<br><br>
[0036]<br>
On each side on which each side component 208 is opposite, the fastener 323 coupled to the swing shaft 207 via a crank mechanism 322, 320 and 321 is housed in a state in which the fastener is allowed to vertically move by guide stoppers 324 and 325 . The fastener 323 is vertically moved in interlock with the turning of the swing shaft 207 when the seat post 202 is raised as described referring to Figs. 3 and 6B. [0037]<br>
As described above, in this embodiment, as the motorcycle and the four-wheel vehicle are fastened by the fastener 323 in interlock with the turning of the swing shaft 207, not only fastening operation is not required but the motorcycle can be prevented from being left unfastened onto the four-wheel vehicle. As the electric contact is provided to the fastener 323 and the battery of the motorcycle is charged via the fastener 323 by a power source of the four-wheel vehicle, charging utilizing transit time is enabled without connecting a charging apparatus separately. [0038]<br>
Inside the lower frame pipe 314, a rear locking mechanism for locking or unlocking the slide of the side component 208 on the lower frame pipe 314 in interlock with putting-in/out operation of the step 303 is built. The locking mechanism is mainly composed of a locking shaft 331, a locking rubber 333 and a rubber case 332, and is operated by the step 303. [0039]<br>
Fig. 11A is a front view showing the locking shaft 331,<br><br>
Fig. 11B is its side view, a part of a small diameter 351 pierced by the step 303 is formed in the vicinity of the end and a cam 384 is formed in the vicinity of the rear end. The locking shaft 331 is supported at both ends so that the shaft can be turned and is turned in interlock with the putting-in/out operation of the step 303. The cam 384 is laid when the step 303 is located in a housed position and becomes upright when the step is taken out. [0040]<br>
Fig. 12A is a front view showing the rubber case 332, Fig. 12B is its side view, Fig. 13A shows the surface of the locking rubber 333, Fig. 13B shows the side and Fig. 13C shows the back. [0041]<br>
The locking rubber 333 is formed by an elastic body in the shape of an arc inscribed on the inner surface of the rubber case 332 and is provided with a superficial protrusion 382 and a back protrusion 383 in the respective centers of the surface and the back. The locking rubber 333 is attached and fixed to the inside of the rubber case 332 so that the superficial protrusion 382 is protruded outside from an opening 381 of the rubber case 332. [0042]<br>
Figs. 14 and 15 are explanatory drawings for explaining locking operation by a front locking mechanism composed of the components. [0043]<br>
In a state in which the step 303 is taken out, as the<br><br>
cam 384 is located in upright posture in which the longitudinal direction of the cam is vertically directed as shown in Fig. 14, the back protrusion 383 of the locking rubber 333 is pushed out by both ends of the cam 384 and the superficial protrusion 382 is largely protruded outside from the opening 381 of the rubber case 332. The protruded superficial protrusion 382 pierces an opening 385 shown in Fig. 9 of the lower frame pipe 314, is fitted into an opening 386 shown in Fig. 9 provided to the side component 208 and blocks its sliding.<br>
[0044]<br>
In the meantime, in a state in which the step 303 is housed, as the longitudinal direction of the cam 384 is horizontally laid as shown in Fig. 15, the superficial protrusion 382 of the locking rubber 333 is housed inside. Therefore, the sliding along the lower frame pipe 314 of the side component 208 is enabled.<br>
[0045]<br>
As described above, in this embodiment, as the sliding of the rear frame 2 toward the center frame 3 is locked or unlocked in interlock with the putting-in/out operation of the step 303, operation dedicated to locking/unlocking is not required.<br>
[0046]<br>
Next, the structure of the front frame 1 and a mechanism for coupling it to the center frame 3 will be described.<br>
[0047]<br>
Fig. 16 is a development showing the head pipe 103 which is a main part of the front frame 1. The head pipe 103 is<br><br>
composed of a base 103 (c) provided with a through hole 113 that supports the front fork 106 so that the front fork can be steered and a pair of right and left shafts 103 (R, L) extended in parallel backward from the base 103 (c) , and has the shape of a tuning fork as a whole. Operators 141 (R, L) of the front locking mechanism for prohibiting the sliding of the front frame 1 toward the center frame 3 in an extended state, that is, in a traveling state are assembled at the rear end of each shaft 103 (R, L). [0048]<br>
One 141 (R) of the operators is mainly composed of a hook pipe 151, a base plate 152, a lever plate 153, a lever 154, a fitting pin 155 and a cover 156.  The other 141 (L) of the operators is different from one 141 (R) in that a fitting cylinder 160 composed of a fitting inner cylinder 157, a fitting outer cylinder 158 and a fitting ball 159 held between the fitting inner cylinder 157 and the fitting outer cylinder 158 is equipped in place of the fitting pin 155. [0049]<br>
In a process for manufacturing the motorcycle, as shown in Fig. 17, the head pipe shafts 103 (R, L) are inserted into the guide rollers 302 of the center frame 3 beforehand and afterward, the operator 141 is assembled at the rear end of each pipe shaft 103 (R, L). [0050]<br>
Between the guide roller 302 of the center frame 3 and the operator 141 of the front frame 1, a male connector 162 and a female connector 161 for securing electric connection<br><br>
between each frame 1 and 2 at an extended time and electrically disconnecting both at a reduced time are provided. The female connector 161 is screwed on an upper part of the guide roller 302 via a mounting member 163.  The male connector 162 is screwed on the base plate 152 of the operator 141. [0051]<br>
Fig. 18 shows positional relation between the head pipe shaft 103 (R, L) and the guide roller 302 in a frame reduced state, that is, in the housed state. The female connector 161 is covered with a cover 341 together with the guide roller 302 and the female connector 162 is covered with a cover 149. [0052]<br>
In the frame reduced state, as the guide roller 302 is located in the front of the shaft 103 (R, L) and the male connector 162 and the female connector 161 are separated, the front frame 1 and the center frame 3 are electrically disconnected. The operator 141 is located in upright posture. [0053]<br>
When the frame is extended from the reduced state to a frame extended state shown in Fig. 19, that is, in the traveling state, the guide roller 302 is slid to the terminal of the shaft 103 (R, L) , and the male connector 162 and the female connector 161 are fitted. Hereby, as both are electrically connected, electric connection between the front frame 1 and the center frame 3 is secured. [0054]<br>
As described above, in this embodiment, as electric connection between each part is disconnected in the housed<br><br>
state that the frame is reduced, electric equipment is never operated even if a switch is operated in the housed state by mistake. [0055]<br>
Fig. 20 is a perspective view showing a state in which the connectors 161 and 162 are fitted. Guide members 164 and 163 for relatively guiding both to optimum positions in fitting are formed in an upper part of each connector 161, 162 . As shown in Fig. 21, the guide member 164 is provided with a through hole 163b and a tapered part 164a for facilitating guiding a pin member 163a of the guide member 163 into the through hole 163b is formed at the end of its opening. [0056]<br>
Fig. 41 is a sectional view showing a state in which the connectors 161 and 162 are fitted and the same reference number denotes the same or similar part. [0057]<br>
The connector 162 is elastically fitted to the base plate 152 shown in Fig. 17 via a boss 193 and a spring 194 by a screw 195. According to such a fitting method, the connector 162 can be always kept in an elastically floating state from the base plate 152 by the boss 193 elastically repelled by the spring 194. Therefore, as the following error is absorbed even if a slight error is made between the relative positions of the connectors 161 and 162 when the guide roller 302 is slid to the terminal of the shaft 103 (R, L) as shown in Fig. 19, satisfactory fitting is enabled. [0058]<br><br>
Also, in this embodiment, as tapered parts 161a and 162a for facilitating fitting both are formed not only between the guide members 164 and 163 but in a part in which the connectors 161 and 162 are fitted, satisfactory fitting is enabled even if a slight error is made between the relative positions of the connectors 161 and 162. [0059]<br>
Further, in this embodiment, as a contact 195 of the connector 161 is a spring pin and as enlarged in Figs. 42, a Spring pin 196 elastically protruded from the end of the contact 195 is elastically pressed on a concave portion 197a provided to the end of a contact 197 of the connector 162. Therefore, as vibration and misregistration between the connectors 161 and 162 are absorbed, electric connection in a part in which the frames are coupled can be always kept satisfactory. [0060]<br>
Fig. 23 is a sectional view showing each operator 141 (R, L) . After the guide roller 302 is slid to the terminal of the head pipe shaft 103 (R, L) as shown in Fig. 19, each operator 141 is gripped by right and left hands, the right operator 141 (R) is turned by 90 degrees counterclockwise and the left operator 141 (L) is turned by 90 degrees clockwise respectively from upright posture shown in Fig. 23A to laid posture shown in Fig. 23B. [0061]<br>
Next, the levers 154 of the operators 141 are gripped and are slid inside as shown in Fig. 23C. At this time, the fitting pin 155 is protruded from an opening 148 (R) in the<br><br>
right operator 141R, the fitting cylinder 160 is protruded from an opening 148 (L) in the left operator 141L, the fitting pin 155 is inserted into the fitting cylinder 160, and the fitting pin 155 and the fitting cylinder 160 are mutually fitted by the fitting ball 159. Hereby, as shown in Fig. 24, as the right and left shafts 103 (R, L) are mechanically coupled, the rigidity of the frame in traveling is enhanced. [0062]<br>
Further, in a traveling state in which the operator 141 is laid, as shown in Fig. 22, the hook pipe 151 shown in Fig. 16 in the head pipe shaft 103 (R, L) is turned by 90 degrees inside and is fitted into a side opening 191 of the shaft 103 (R, L) and a side opening 391 of the guide roller 302. Hereby, the guide roller 302 and the shaft 103 (R, L) are locked and the relative sliding of both is prohibited. [0063]<br>
As described above, in this embodiment, as not only the front frame 1 can be locked in the center frame 3 only by turning the right and left operators 141 but the operators are arranged closely, locking/unlocking operation is facilitated. [0064]<br>
Next, a mechanism for locking the handlebar shaft 102 will be described. Fig. 25 is a partial perspective view showing a mechanism for locking the handlebar shaft 102 and the handlebar bridge 108 and Figs. 26 and 27 show the handlebar locking mechanism viewed from the back of the handlebar bridge 108 . The handlebar locking mechanism is respectively provided to the right and left handlebar shafts 102, however, only the<br><br>
mechanism provided to the right handlebar shaft 102 (R) will<br>
be described as an example below.<br>
[0065]<br>
The handlebar locking mechanism is composed of an L-type operating lever 181, a rod 182, an eccentric crank 183, a rod 184, a pusher 185 and a pusher guide 186. In an extended state shown in Fig. 28, as the L-type operating lever 181 is pushed on the back side of the handlebar bridge 108 as shown in Fig. 26, the end of the pusher 185 enters an opening 187 provided to the side of the L-type handlebar shaft 102 and its sliding is prevented. [0066]<br>
In the meantime, when the L-type operating lever 181 is pulled out, the eccentric crank 183 is turned counterclockwise as shown in Fig. 27 and the pusher 185 is pulled out via the rod 184. Therefore, when the right and left L-type operating levers 181 are operated, handlebar locking is released and the handlebar shaft 102 is pushed down in that state, the handlebar shaft 102 is slid below the handlebar bridge 108 as shown in Fig. 29. [0067]<br>
Connectors 191 and 192 similar to the connectors 161 and 162 for electrically connecting the front frame 1 and the center frame 3 are provided to the side of the handlebar bridge 108 and the lower end of the handlebar shaft 102, the connectors 191 and 192 are separated by the sliding, and the handlebar bridge 108 and the handlebar shaft 102 are electrically disconnected.<br><br><br>
[0068]<br>
Fig. 30 is a development showing the configuration of the front wheel FW and the same reference number denotes the same or similar part. [0069]<br>
The front wheel FW is mainly composed of a mounting flange 133, a front wheel 134, a disc rotor 135 and a tire 137 and the disc rotor 135 is screwed and fixed on the front wheel 134. The front wheel FW is pierced by a front wheel shaft 199 extended from the end of the front fork 106 together with right and left wheel caps 131 and 138, is supported in an overhung state and is fastened by a nut 132. A brake caliper 136 is screwed and fixed to the front fork 106 together with the wheel cap 138. A caliper cover 139 is fixed to the wheel cap 138. [0070]<br>
Fig. 31 is a development showing the configuration of the rear wheel RW and the same reference number denotes the same or similar part. [0071]<br>
The swing arm 201 is provided with a drum brake 239 and a rear wheel shaft 240 and a stator 231 is screwed and fixed on the periphery. A sensor 235 and a magnet rotor 233 are coaxially inserted on the side of the rear wheel 237 and are fixed by a clip 232.<br>
Fig. 32 shows the configuration of a power source housing 244 secured under the seat 203. In the power source housing 244, two sets of battery units 251 (R, L) integrated by arranging plural single cells like straw bags for shrinkage are housed<br><br><br>
together with disconnecting switches 247 and 248, a control unit 242 including a DC-DC converter and a capacitor 243 having large capacity. [0072]<br>
Fig. 33 is a perspective view showing a headlight unit 105, Fig. 34 is a perspective view showing a light source 175 built in the headlight unit 105, Fig. 35 is a front view showing the light source 175 and Fig. 36 is its side view. [0073]<br>
The light source 175 in this embodiment includes a base member 189 , a board 178 mounted on the base member 189 and plural LEDs 177 three-dimensionally held by the base member 189 as shown in Figs. 35 and 36. [0074]<br>
Multiple openings are provided to the curved base surface 176 of the base member 189 in a matrix and a step-wise bottom face 188 is formed at the bottom of each opening. White high-intensity LED 177 is housed in the opening so that a part is exposed forward by predetermined length from the base surface 176. The electrode pin of each LED 177 is soldered and fixed to the board 178 in a state in which the back is pushed until the back collides with the bottom face 188. Therefore, the exposed length of each LED 177 is defined by difference in a level between each bottom face 188 . A driving circuit for lighting LED 177 is mounted on the board 178. [0075]<br>
As described above, according to this embodiment, LEDs can be three-dimensionally arranged without using a curved<br><br>
board. As the height and the directing of LED do not depend upon the soldering of the printed-circuit board 178 and LED electrodes, LEDs can be three-dimensionally arranged at high luminous intensity distribution precision without difference between individuals. [0076]<br>
Fig. 37 is a partial perspective view showing the configuration of the vicinity of the right handlebar grip. A winker unit 166 described in detail later is mounted on a handlebar pipe 17 0 and a grip 104 is mounted around the winker unit. A brake lever 167 and an accel lever 168 are provided at the inside end of the grip 104, that is, in a range which a thumb of a right hand reaches when the grip is grasped by the right hand.  The aperture of the accel lever 168 is detected by an accel aperture sensor 169. [0077]<br>
Fig. 38 is a perspective view showing the winker unit 166, Fig. 39A is a sectional view showing the winker unit and Fig. 39B is a front view showing the end. [0078]<br>
The winker unit 166 in this embodiment includes a supporting pipe 171 that pierces the handlebar pipe 170, a board 179, circular supporting structure 173 which is located at one end of the supporting pipe 171 and the center of which is spherically expanded and five high-intensity LEDs 174 as shown in Figs. 39, and the end at which LEDs 174 are exposed is covered with a transparent cap 172 as shown in Fig. 38. [0079]<br><br>
The five high-intensity LEDs 174 are fixed to the board 179 in a state in which other four LEDs are arranged around one LED in the center at an interval of 90 degrees and the optical axis is slightly set off the central axis. The optical axis of each LED 174 is adjusted by inserting the bottom of each LED 174 up to the spherical part of the supporting plate 173 and fixing the electrode to the board 179. [0080]<br>
According to such configuration, the luminous intensity distribution characteristic of the winker can be precisely defined by the shape of the circular supporting structure 173. As the winker can be formed compactly at the end of the handlebar, the operability of the handlebar is never damaged by the winker. [0081]<br>
Fig. 40 is a back view showing the electric motorcycle and the same reference number denotes the same or similar part. [0082]<br>
In this embodiment, multiple red LEDs are three-dimensionally arranged at each back of the frame bodies 312 (R, L) to be a brake lamp 361 (R, L) and orange LED is three-dimensionally arranged under the brake lamp to be a winker lamp 362 (R, L). A number plate 6 is arranged at the back of the seat 203. [0083]<br>
As described above, in this embodiment, power saving required for an electric vehicle can be realized by adopting LED as a light source for the headlight, the brake lamp and the winker. As the constraint in design is reduced by adopting<br><br>
LED as a light source, the appearance can be enhanced.<br>
[0084]<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
According to the invention, the following effect is achieved.<br><br>
(1)	The height of the handlebar shaft can be fully lowered without folding the handlebar shaft backward. Therefore, as interference between the handlebar and the seat is not required to be considered, not only the degree of freedom of the design is increased but sufficient compaction is enabled.<br>
(2)	As handlebar locking does not function in a state in which the handlebar is not turned up to a normal running position, it is facilitated to check that the handlebar is turned up to the normal running position. .<br><br><br>
