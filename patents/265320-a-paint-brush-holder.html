				<td>A PAINTBRUSH HOLDER<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a brush holder.<br>
This invention has particular but not exclusive application to a paintbrush<br>
holder, and for illustrative purposes reference wifl be made to such application.<br>
However, it is to be understood that this invention could be used in other<br>
applications, such as pastry brush holders, mop holders, and wet broom holders.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Paint brushes generally fall into the categories of tradesmen's brushes and<br>
handymen's brushes. Tradesmen's brushes are of high quality and are relatively<br>
expensive. The brushes are cleaned and reused where possible. Some modern<br>
coatings often require the use of expensive solvents for clean-up. There is a<br>
trade-off between recovering the brush and the cost of cleaning. Other paint<br>
systems may only require that the brush be kept solvent or water moist in order to<br>
prevent cure-off of the paint in the brush between uses. Cleaned brushes are<br>
generally hung up to keep the configuration of the bristles. Handymen's brushes<br>
where used in these applications are rarely cleaned and are thus treated as<br>
disposable.<br>
The usable life of both tradesmen's and handymen's brushes may be<br>
greatly extended by immersion between uses in a solvent. However, the weight of<br>
the brush against the tips of the bristles of a brush standing in solvent causes<br>
distortion of the brush shape, as does general storage of brushes where the bristle<br>
mass is distorted by that storage. One solution is to suspend the brushes in the<br>
solvent. However, this requires the provision of hanging means at the right height<br>
which compels the storage to be in a fixed position. It may not be usable for<br>
brushes of different hanging heights.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
This invention in one aspect resides broadly in a brush holder including a<br>
housing having front and rear wall portions spaced at their respective side edges<br>
by side wall portions, said housing defining an open-topped cavity adapted to<br>
receive the bristle portion of a brush, locating means adapted to engage the<br>
handle of the brush, an aperture associated with a lower portion of the housing<br>
and adapted to admit a solvent, and suspension means whereby the brush holder<br>
and brush in assembly may be suspended.<br>
The housing and the locating means may be formed unitarily from a blank<br>
of sheet material foldable to form the brush holder.<br>
The sheet material may be a flexible material selected whereby folding<br>
provides the brush holder with form stability. Alternatively the material may be a<br>
substantially rigid material and has self-hinge lines formed thereon to enable the<br>
blank to be foldable. The material may be selected from sheet metal or plastic,<br>
coated paper material or the like. Preferably the material is selected to be<br>
substantially unaffected by either the paint medium, paint solvent or clean up<br>
liquids used for the intended paint system.<br>
The location means may include a suitably configured web formed adjacent<br>
the upper edge of one or both of the front and rear wall portions. Such locating<br>
means may for example include an opening through which the handle of the brush<br>
may pass. In addition or in the alternative, the location means may include a<br>
brush handle gripping means selected to secure said brush in a selected position<br>
in the housing. For example the gripping means may comprise a series of resilient<br>
fingers depending into the opening formed in the web and adapted to receive and<br>
retain the brush handle on insertion.<br>
The aperture adapted to admit a solvent may comprise an open bottom of<br>
the housing. Alternatively, the aperture may comprise one or more apertures<br>
through a wall of the housing.<br>
The suspension means may includes one or more tabs or the like<br>
associated with the upper portion of the housing and having formed therein a<br>
hanging hook or hanging loop. Alternatively the suspension means may include a<br>
pair of spaced lands about said locating means and adapted to bear on the<br>
shoulders of the brush, and wherein the brush and holder in assembly are<br>
suspended by the hanging hole of the brush.<br>
In another aspect the present invention resides broadly in a brush holder<br>
formed unitarily of sheet material and including a body portion defining a rear wall<br>
of the brush holder, a pair of lateral portions each spaced from opposite sides of<br>
said body portion by a web defined by a pair of spaced folds, upper and lower<br>
closure portions each spaced from opposite ends of said body portion by an end<br>
portion defined by a pair of spaced folds thereabout, said upper end portion<br>
including an aperture, said lateral and closure portions being adapted to fold up<br>
about said folds to form a housing about a paint brush resting on said body portion<br>
with the handle through said aperture, and securing means selectively retaining<br>
said lateral and closure portions in said folded configuration.<br>
The sheet material may be a flexible material, wherein the pattern and fold<br>
parameters, and the folding order and securing means are all selected whereby<br>
the housing has sufficient form stability to form a relatively rigid housing for a<br>
paintbrush. The material may be selected from sheet metal or plastic, coated<br>
paper material or the like. Preferably the material is selected to be substantially<br>
unaffected by either the paint medium, paint solvent or clean up liquids used for<br>
the intended paint system.<br>
The body portion may comprise a flat region bounded on four sides by the<br>
first fold line of each of the pairs of lateral and closure portions. The fold lines may<br>
be produced by any suitable means and will be largely dictated by the choice of<br>
sheet material. For example for thermoplastic materials the fold lines my take the<br>
form of a conventional self-hinge pressed into the material.<br>
The pairs of lateral and closure portions may be respectively the same or<br>
may be different. For example the closure portion having the handle aperture may<br>
be a short portion and the other of the pair may be a relatively longer portion.<br>
Where the lateral portions differ there may be provided a first of the pair adapted<br>
to be folded first to extent substantially over the face of the brush opposed to the<br>
face of the brush resting on the body portion, whereupon the other may be<br>
relieved over part of its equivalent area since it would not be required to close off<br>
the brush surface. However, it is preferred that the folding sequence start with the<br>
top and bottom portions, and that at least these portions be adapted to cooperate<br>
to substantially overlay the whole of the surface of the body portion and thus cover<br>
substantially the whole of the brush major surface.<br>
The aperture may be adapted to further cooperate with tabs provided on an<br>
edge of each of the lateral portions to provide the securing means, cooperating<br>
where necessary with corresponding slots. Alternatively the securing means may<br>
be formed in one or more pairs of the respective portions in the form of a press<br>
stud or the like, either self formed or attached by any suitable means, hook-pile<br>
fastening or the like.<br>
One or more of the lower portions of the lower regions of the respective<br>
portions may be provided with one or more apertures to provide for entry and<br>
drainage of thinners or other solvents. By this means the holder may be used to<br>
hold brushes in solvent containers.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
In order that this invention may be more readily understood and put into<br>
practical effect, reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings which<br>
illustrate a preferred embodiment of the invention and wherein:<br>
