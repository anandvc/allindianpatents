				<td>Object of the invention<br>
The   present   invention   relates   to   a   process   for   preparing    a   new<br>
benzimidazole    derivatives    and    more    particularly    to     a    new<br>
benzimidazole derivatives with H1  antihistamine activity,    lacking cardiotoxic effects.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The prior art closest to the compounds of the present invention is in Spanish patent No. 9201512 which describes a number of piperidine benzimidazole derivatives with antihistaminic and antiallergic activity of general formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The majors structural difference between the compounds of the present invention and those of the said patent is the presence of oxygenated functions in the phenyl group substitution. An important pharmacophorous character has moreover been found for these oxygenated functions which consists essentially in a selectivity of action and provides a pharmacological profile distinct from that of other known antihistamines. The compounds disclosed in this invention present an almost exclusive H1 antihistaminic pharmacological activity and are therefore devoid of action on other<br>
The present invention relates to a group of new compounds with benzimidazolic structure having potent selective H1 antihistaminic activity, lacking activity on the central nervous system and on the cardiovascular system.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a process for preparing a new benzimidazole derivatives of formula:- (Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1 is a short chain alkyl group and R2 is 4, 4-dimethyl-2-oxazolinyl group, said process comprising -<br>
N-alkylating 2-(4-piperidinyl)-lH-benzimidazole with an alkylating agent of the kind such as herein described in the presence of an inorganic base of the kind such as herein described to form benzimidazole; and<br>
- N-alkylating said benzimidazole with an ether of the kind such as herein described in the presence of hydride or an alkaline metal carbonate;<br>
The compounds subject of the present invention have the following general formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which R1 is hydrogen or a short chain hydrocarbon group such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, cyclopropyl or vinyl, and R2 is a group selected from among CH2OH COOH COORs and 4,4-dimethyl-2-oxazolinyl, R3 being a short chain alkyl group as previously defined, and their addition salts with pharmacologically acceptable acids or bases.<br>
Compounds I in which R1 is a short chain alkyl group and R2 is the 4,4-dimethyl-2-oxazolinyl group can be conveniently prepared by an N-alkylation reaction of 2-(4-piperidinyl)-lH-benzirnidazole with an alkylating agent of formula III wherein X is a good leaving group in nucleophilic substitution reactions such as Cl, Br, I, R4SO2, R2SO3, etc., in the presence of an inorganic base, such as an alkaline metal carbonate or bicarbonate within an organic solvent, followed by another N-alkylation reaction of the resulting benzimidazole IV with an ether of formula XCH2CH2ORl, wherein X has the meaning given above and R1 is a short chain hydrocarbon group, such as Me, Et, i-Pr, cyclopropyl, vinyl, etc., in the presence of a hydride or an alkaline metal carbonate.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Compounds I, in which R1 is a short chain alkyl group and R2 is a carboxyl group, can be conveniently prepared by hydrolysis of the benzimidazoles la with a mineral acid such as HC1 or H2SO4.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Compounds I in which R1 is a short chain alkyl group and R2 is a<br>
COOR3 group in which R4 is a short chain alkyl group, can be prepared<br>
by acid hydrolysis of the benzimidazoles la in the presence of an alcohol<br>
solvent R3OH, in adequate conditions for transesterification.<br>
 (Formula Removed)<br>
Compounds I in which R1 is a short chain alkyl group and R2 is a CH2OH group can be prepared by a reduction of the benzimidazoles lb or Ic with a suitable reducing agent, such as aluminium and lithium hydride. (Formula Removed)<br>
Compound I in which R1 is a hydrogen and R3 is a 4,4-dimethyl-2-oxazolinyl group can be prepared by an alkylation of the beiizimidazole IV with ethyl chloroacetate in the presence of a hydride or an alkaline metal carbonate to yield the ester V, which is then reduced by a reducing agent such as aluminium and lithium hydride.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Compound I in which R1 is a hydrogen and R2 is a COOH group is conveniently prepared by hydrolysis with a mineral acid such as HC1 or H2SO4 of the compound Ie.<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The obtained new benzixnidazoles I can be turned into pharmaceutically acceptable salts by treatment with suitable acids or bases. Compounds of formula I have useful pharmacological properties. In particular, they are potent H1 antihistamines. This activity was clearly demonstrated in vitro by blocking the histamine-induced contractions in the isolated guinea pig ileum (Magnus, Pflugers, Arch. Ges. Physiol., 102, 123 (1904); Arunlakshana, O. and Schild, H.O., Br. J. Pharmacol. 14,48-58 (1959)) and in vivo by the capacity to inhibit the increment of histamine-induced cutaneous capillary permeability in rats (Lefebvre, P., Salmon, J., Leconte and Cauwenberge, V.H., C.R. Soc. Bio!.. 156, 183-186 (1962); Udaka, K., Takeuchi, Y. and Morat, H.Z., Proo. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 133, 1384-1387 (1970)).<br>
Thus, compound lb (Rl-ethyl) proved to be a potent guinea pig ileum H1-receptor histamine mixed antagonist, with calculated pA =98-8.10 and pD3'—6.50. This same compound inhibited in vivo the increase in capillary permeability in rats with a DE50 close to 2 mg/kg p o. At doses of 5 mg/kg p.o. it maintained a significant activity, in excess of 5096, for at least 6 hours.<br>
These compounds are highly selective in their pharmacological action, and present no significant anticholinergic activity nor activity on the central nervous and cardiovascular systems. Thus, compound lb (R1-Et) is not able to antagonize significantly the aeetylcholine-induced contractions in isolated guinea pig ileum at 0.1 M concentrations and does not modify the spontaneous motor activity of the rat at 100 mg/kg p.o.; furthermore, this same compound, administered at 2C mg/kg i.v., induces no morphological ECG disturbance nor does it increase the QTC interval in rats.<br>
In view of their useful pharmacological antihistaminic and antiallergic properties, the compounds described in the present invention can be formulated in several pharmaceutical forms to be later administered<br>
orally, topically, injectably and rectally. Oral preparations are made by intimately mixing a quantity effective as antihistaminic of one of the products described in the present invention with excipients such as lactose, cellulose, talc and the like for tablets or capsules, or water, glycols, alcohols, oils and the like for syrups, solutions and suspensions. Topical administration can be made in the form of creams, ointments, gels, solutions and transcutaneous plasters, using agents such as vaseline, polyethylene glycols, etc. as a carrier. In preparations for injectables, the excipient will be, at least for the most part, sterilised water, although other excipients, such as saline solutions, glucose solutions, etc., or mixtures thereof, may be added to enhance solubility.<br>
The examples detailed below illustrate the present invention without howsoever limiting its scope.<br>
