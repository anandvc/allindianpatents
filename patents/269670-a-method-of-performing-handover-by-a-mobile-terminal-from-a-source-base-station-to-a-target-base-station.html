Description<br>
METHOD FOR PERFORMING HANDOVER PROCEDURE AND<br>
CREATING DATA<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to wireless communications and, more particularly, to a<br>
method for performing a handover procedure and creating data.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	A cellular scheme is a concept proposed to overcome the limitation of service area,<br>
and frequency and subscriber accommodation capacity. It provides a speech area (call<br>
area, or a communication range) by changing a single base station of a high output into<br>
a plurality of base stations of a low output. Namely, a mobile communication service<br>
area is divided into a plurality of small cells, and different frequencies are allocated to<br>
neighbor cells while the same frequency band is allocated to cells which are so away<br>
from each other that no interference is generated therebetween to thus spatially re-use<br>
frequencies.<br>
[3]	Handover (or handoff) refers to a function according to which when a user<br>
equipment (UE) moves and is released from a current communication service base<br>
station (referred to as 'serving cell', hereinafter) and enters a neighbor cell of an<br>
adjacent communication service area, the UE is automatically tuned with a new traffic<br>
channel of the adjacent communication service area and maintains its call state. That<br>
is, when the UE is communicating with a particular base station and if a signal strength<br>
of the particular base station (referred to as 'source base station, hereinafter) weakens,<br>
the UE is linked to a neighbor base station (referred to as 'target base station,<br>
hereinafter). When handover is supported, a call interruption, that may be otherwise<br>
generated when the UE moves to a neighbor cell, can be resolved.<br>
[4]	Handover may be defined as three separated steps, a handover preparation, a<br>
handover execution, and a handover completion.<br>
[5]	The UE measures a signal transmitted from the serving cell, and if a channel quality<br>
is drops to below a certain threshold value, the UE transmits corresponding in-<br>
formation to the source base station through a measurement report. Then, the source<br>
base station determines handover according to the measurement report. Upon de-<br>
termining handover, the source base station a handover request to the target base<br>
station and then receives a handover request ACK from the target base station. The<br>
source base station informs the UE about a start of handover by sending a handover<br>
command. The processes up till now belong to the handover preparation.<br>
[6]	After the handover preparation, the UE moves to the target base station through the<br><br>
handover execution and the handover completion processes. At this time, the source<br>
base station stops downlink data transmission of a PDCP (Packet Data Convergence<br>
Protocol) layer and forwards downlink data to the target base station.<br>
[7]	In this respect, however, an RLC layer and a PDCP layer of the UE in the downlink<br>
transmission and an RLC layer and a PDCP layer of the base station in the uplink<br>
transmission do not know the handover execution and completion processes. Ac-<br>
cordingly, the RLC layers cannot help but transfer SDUs (Service Data Units) in<br>
sequence regardless of handover. This is the same even when the RLC layers cannot<br>
transfer the SDUs to the PDCP layers due to a blank of PDUs corresponding to some<br>
sequence numbers. The PDCP layers also cannot forward nor reorder downlink or<br>
uplink data.<br>
[8]	Due to such a restriction, if handover is completed with a blank of a PDU, other<br>
PDUs following the blank PDU are all removed. The downlink data removed at the<br>
RLC layer of the UE can be restored as the PDCP layer of the UE requests re-<br>
transmission of the downlink data from the PDCP layer of the target base station after<br>
handover is completed. And the data removed at the RLC layer of the base station can<br>
be restored as the PDCP layer of the target base station requests re-transmission of the<br>
data after the handover is completed.<br>
[9]	However, because such restoration requests restoration between the PDCP layer of<br>
the UE and that of the target base station, namely, requests the re-transmission in the<br>
wireless communication, radio resources are wasted, and because the restoration time<br>
is delayed, the transmission efficiency is degraded.<br>
[10]	Thus, in order to solve the problem, a handover executing method and data creating<br>
method allowing data transmission/reception between the RLC layer and the PDCP<br>
layer while the handover is being performed is requested.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[11]	The present invention provides a method for performing handover procedure and<br>
creating data.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[12]	According to an embodiment of the invention, a method and device for performing<br>
handover by a UE from a source base station to a target base station is provided. The<br>
method includes receiving at least one data block from the source base station,<br>
receiving a handover command from the source base station, assembling the at least<br>
one data block out of sequence regardless of the reception order to create a re-<br>
assembled data block, and transmitting a handover confirmation to the target base<br>
station.<br><br>
[13]	According to another embodiment of the invention, a method and device for<br>
performing handover by a source base station to a target base station over a UE is<br>
provided. The method includes transmitting a handover command to the UE, as-<br>
sembling at least one data block transmitted from the UE out of sequence regardless of<br>
the reception order to create a reassembled data block, and forwarding the reassembled<br>
data block to the target base station.<br>
[ 14]	According to still another embodiment of the invention, a method and device for<br>
creating a data block by an RLC layer is provided. The method includes receiving at<br>
least one PDU, receiving a message indicating reassembling the at least one PDU out<br>
of sequence regardless of the reception order, and reassembling the at least one PDU<br>
out of sequence to create an SDU.<br>
[15]	The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present<br>
invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
[16]	A lower layer is informed about a handover time point, so that the lower layer can<br>
generate data blocks out of sequence and transmits them to an upper layer, to thereby<br>
guarantee a transfer of data without a loss although handover is performed. Because<br>
data is transmitted without a loss, overhead due to re-transmission data and overhead<br>
due to an additional control signal can be reduced, and a processing gain can be<br>
obtained.<br>

Mode for the Invention<br>
[31]	FIG. 1 is a schematic block diagram showing a wireless communication system. It<br>
may be a network structure of an E-UMTS (Evolved-Universal Mobile Telecommu-<br>
nications System). The E-UMTS system may be an LTE (Long Term Evolution)<br>
system. The wireless communication system can be widely deployed to provide a<br>
variety of communication services, such as voices, packet data, etc.<br>
[32]	Referring to FIG. 1, an E-UTRAN (Evolved-UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access<br>
Network) includes a base station (BS) 20. user equipment (UE) 10 may be fixed or<br>
have mobility, and may be referred to as another terminology, such as a mobile station<br>
(MS), a user terminal (UT), a subscriber station (SS), a wireless device, etc. The BS 20<br>
generally refers to a fixed station that communicates with the UE 10 and may be called<br>
another terminology, such as an NB (Node-B), an eNB (evolved-Node B), a BTS<br>
(Base Transceiver System), an access point, etc. There are one or more cells within the<br>
coverage of the BS 20. An interface may be used for user traffic or control traffic<br>
between BSs 20. Hereinbelow, downlink refers to communication from the BS 20 to<br>
the UE 10, and uplink refers to communication from the UE 10 to the BS 20.<br>
[33]	The BS 20 provides end points of a user plane and a control plane to the UE 10. The<br>
BSs 20 may be connected via an X2 interface, and a meshed network structure in<br>
which the X2 interface always exists may be provided between neighbor BSs 20.<br>
[34]	FIG. 2 is a schematic block diagram showing a functional split between an E-<br>
UTRAN and an EPC.<br>
[35]	With reference to FIG. 2, shaded blocks (with oblique lines) represent radio protocol<br><br>
layers, and empty blocks represent functional entities of the control plane.<br>
[36]	The BS performs the following functions: (1) radio resource management (RRM)<br>
function such as radio bearer (RB) control, radio admission control, connection<br>
mobility control, dynamic resource allocation to the UE; (2) IP (Internet Protocol)<br>
header compression and decryption of user data stream; (3) routing of user plane data<br>
to a serving gateway (S-GW); (4) scheduling and transmission of a paging message;<br>
(5) scheduling and transmission of broadcast information; and (6) measurement for<br>
mobility and scheduling and establishing a measurement report.<br>
[37]	An MME performs the following functions: (1) distribution of paging messages to<br>
BSs; (2) security control; (3) idle state mobility control; (4) S bearer control; (5)<br>
ciphering and integrity protection of NAS (Non-Access Stratum) signaling.<br>
[38]	The S-GW performs the following functions: (1) termination of a user plane packet<br>
with respect to paging; and (2) user plane switching to support UE mobility.<br>
[39]	Meanwhile, layers of a radio interface protocol between the UE and the base station<br>
include a physical layer, a MAC (Medium Access Control) layer, an RLC (Radio Link<br>
Control) layer, a PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol) layer, an RRC (Radio<br>
Resource Control) layer.<br>
[40]	The layers of the radio interface protocol may be divided into a first layer LI, a<br>
second layer L2, and a third layer L3 based on the three lower layers of an open system<br>
interconnection (OSI) standard model widely known in communication systems.<br>
Compared with the OSI model, the physical layer corresponds to the first layer LI, the<br>
upper MAC layer and the RLC layer correspond to the second layer L2, and the RRC<br>
layer corresponds to the third layer L3. The physical layer belonging to the first layer<br>
provides an information transfer service using a physical channel, and the radio RRC<br>
layer positioned at the third layer L3 serves to control radio resources between the UE<br>
and the network.<br>
[41]	The layer structure of the radio interface protocol may be applied in the same manner<br>
to the UE and the E-UTRAN. In the UE, all the protocols may belong to a single<br>
entity, while in the E-UTRAN, the protocols may be distributed by respective network<br>
configuration elements.<br>
[42]	Data transmitted by such entire protocol structure may be divided into two regions of<br>
a user plane and a control plane according to a type of the data. The user plane is a<br>
region where traffic information of a user such as voice or IP packets are transmitted,<br>
and the control plane is a region where control information such as a network interface,<br>
maintaining or management of a call, or the like. Data transferred by the RRC layer is<br>
included in the control plane. The RLC layer may belong to the user plane or the<br>
control plane according to a type of a connected upper layer. Namely, if the RLC layer<br>
is connected with the RRC layer, it may belong to the control plane, and in other cases,<br><br>
the RLC layer may belong to the user plane.<br>
[43]	FIG. 3 is a schematic block diagram showing elements of a UE. The UE 50 includes<br>
a processor 51, a memory 52, an RF unit 53, a display unit 54, and a user interface unit<br>
55. The processor 51 includes the layers of the radio interface protocol and provides<br>
the control plane and the user plane. Functions of the layers may be implemented via<br>
the processor 51. The memory 52 is connected with the processor 51 and stores a UE<br>
driving system, an application and a general file. The display unit 54 displays various<br>
information of the UE and may be formed by using the well know elements such as an<br>
LCD (Liquid Crystal Display), an OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode), or the like.<br>
The user interface unit 55 may be configured by combining well known user interfaces<br>
such as a keypad or a touch screen. The RF unit 53 is connected with the processor and<br>
transmits and/or receives a radio signal.<br>
[44]	FIG. 4 is a schematic block diagram showing the user plane of the radio interface<br>
protocol. FIG. 5 is a schematic block diagram showing the control plane of the radio<br>
interface protocol. It shows the structure of the radio interface protocol between the UE<br>
and the E-UTRAN. The user plane is a protocol stack for transmitting user data, and<br>
the control plane is a protocol stack for transmitting a control signal.<br>
[45]	With reference to FIGs. 4 and 5, the physical layer, as a first layer, provides an in-<br>
formation transfer service to an upper layer by using a physical channel. The physical<br>
layer is connected to an upper layer called a medium access control (MAC) layer via a<br>
transport channel, and data is transferred between the MAC layer and the physical<br>
layer via the transport channel. Meanwhile, between different physical layers, namely,<br>
between a physical layer of a transmitting side and that of a receiving side, data is<br>
transferred via the physical channel.<br>
[46]	Techniques such as data multiplexing, channel coding, spreading, modulation, or the<br>
like, are applied for the physical layer. In the wireless environment, radio signals<br>
change frequently according to the movement of the UE or a surrounding environment,<br>
so various methods for correcting them are required.<br>
[47]	A radio data link layer corresponding to the second layer includes a MAC layer, an<br>
RLC layer, and a PDCP layer. The MAC layer of the second layer, which handles<br>
mapping between a logical channel and a transport channel, selects a proper transport<br>
channel to transmit data received from the RLC layer, and adds required control in-<br>
formation to a header of a MAC PDU (Protocol Data Unit). A mapping relationship<br>
between the logical channel and the transparent channel will be described hereafter.<br>
[48]	The RLC layer of the second layer is positioned at an upper position of the MAC<br>
layer and supports reliable data transmissions. The RLC layer segments and con-<br>
catenates RLC SDUs (Service Data Units) delivered from an upper layer in order to<br>
configure data with a size suitable for a radio interface. The RLC layer of a receiver<br><br>
supports a reassembling function of data to restore the original RLC SDUs from<br>
received RLC PDUs.<br>
[49]	Each RLC entity may operate in a transparent mode (TM), an unacknowledged mode<br>
(UM), and an acknowledged mode (AM) according to a processing and transmission<br>
method of the RLC SDUs. CRC error detection is performed at the physical layer in all<br>
the RLC modes. The results of the CRC checking are delivered together with actual<br>
data to the RLC layer.<br>
[50]	In the transparent mode (TM), the RLC layer delivers an RLC PDU, without adding<br>
a protocol header thereto, to the MAC layer via the transport channel. If an RLC PDU<br>
has a transmission error, it may be removed or have an indication that it has an error.<br>
The TM may be used when upper layer data is a streaming type data. In this case, the<br>
upper layer data is not segmented, and in a particular case, a segmentation/re-<br>
assembling function is used limitedly.<br>
[51]	In the unacknowledged mode (UM), a re-transmission protocol is not used, so data<br>
transfer is not guaranteed. A transmitter deletes data based on a timer without definite<br>
signaling, so RLC PDUs, which have not been transmitted within a particular time, are<br>
removed from a transmission buffer. The PDUs include sequence numbers (SN), so<br>
integrity of the PDUs of an upper layer can be observed. The UM RLC entity is<br>
defined uni-directionally because relationship between uplink and downlink is not<br>
required. For example, a user service to which the UM RLC entity can be applicable<br>
includes a cell broadcast service and a VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol).<br>
[52]	The acknowledged mode (AM) uses an ARQ process to correct an error. If the RLC<br>
PDU is not properly transferred (e.g., as it exceeds the maximum number of re-<br>
transmissions or as a transmission time lapses), the RLC layer reports the upper layer<br>
accordingly and removes the RLC PDU from the buffer. An AM RLC entity, having a<br>
re-transmission function, provides a bi-directional service.<br>
[53]	For the re-transmission function of the AM, various parameters such as a<br>
transmission window (Tx window), a reception window (Rx window), a timer, a<br>
counter, a status PDU (or a status report), a polling bit, or the like, are used. The<br>
transmission window is the number of RLC PDUs that can be transmitted with the<br>
maximum number, in a state that a status PDU is not received from the receiver.<br>
[54]	The PDCP layer of the second layer is used only at a packet switching region, and<br>
may compress a header of an IP packet and transmit the same in order to enhance a<br>
transmission efficiency of packet data in a radio channel.<br>
[55]	The RRC layer of the third layer is defined only at the control plane. The RRC layer<br>
serves to control a lower layer and exchanges radio resource control information<br>
between the UE and the network. Various RRC states are defined according to a com-<br>
munication state of the UE, and a transition between RRC states is possible as<br><br>
necessary. In the RRC layer, various procedures related to radio resource management<br>
such as a system information broadcast, an RRC connection management procedure, a<br>
radio resource control procedure, a security procedure, a measurement procedure, a<br>
mobility management procedure (handover), or the like, are defined.<br>
[56]	A point of time at which handover is reported to a lower layer and its method will<br>
now be described. Here, the lower layer refers to a layer which is lower to the RRC<br>
layer, and the lower layer may refer to the RLC layer or the PDCP layer.<br>
[57]	FIGs. 6 and 7 are flow charts illustrating a point of time for reporting a start of<br>
handover execution to the RLC layer according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. In FIGs. 6 and 7, the points 'a' to 'e' are connected, respectively.<br>
[58]	With reference to FIGs. 6 and 7, a source base station (source eNB) transmits a mea-<br>
surement control to the UE (S10). The UE transmits a measurement report to the<br>
source base station (S11). The source eNB determines whether to perform handover<br>
(S12). When the source eNB determines handover, it transmits a handover request to a<br>
target base station (target eNB) (S13). The target eNB performs an admission control<br>
with respect to the handover request (S14).<br>
[59]	When the target eNB admits the handover request, it transmits a handover request<br>
ACK to the source eNB (S15). The source eNB transmits a handover command to the<br>
UE (S16). The processes up till now belong to handover preparation.<br>
[60]	At the point of time of handover execution, the following step, is reported to the RLC<br>
layer of the UE and to the RLC layer of the source eNB (S17). When the handover<br>
command is transmitted from the source eNB to the UE, the RRC layer of the source<br>
eNB reports the handover to the lower RLC layer and PDCP layer. Also, the RRC<br>
layer of the UE reports the handover to the lower RLC layer and PDCP layer. Upon<br>
receiving the report on the handover, the source eNB and the UE starts out-of-sequence<br>
SDU delivery from the RLC layer to the PDCP layer in the respective devices (S18).<br>
Here, the out-of-sequence SDUs refer to at least one data block included in a reception<br>
window (or OSD_Window, to be described) among data blocks stored in a reception<br>
buffer. The out-of-sequence SDUs are generated by being reassembled regardless of<br>
the order in which they are stored in the reception buffer. In this sense, the out-<br>
of-sequence SDUs are discriminated from in-sequence SDUs, and a data loss can be<br>
reduced during the handover through the out-of-sequence SDU delivery.<br>
[61]	Also at the point of time of handover execution, the UE is detached from an old cell<br>
of the source eNB and attempts synchronization with a new cell of the target eNB, and<br>
the source eNB transfers data packets stored in the buffer to the target eNB (S18).<br>
[62]	Next, the UE matches synchronization to the target eNB (S19). The target eNB<br>
allocates uplink resources to the UE and performs time alignment (TA) (S20). The UE<br>
transmits a handover confirmation to the target eNB (S21). As the handover con-<br><br>
figuration is transmitted, the handover execution is terminated, and the handover<br>
completion follows.<br>
[63]	Upon receiving the handover confirmation, the target eNB transmits a path switch to<br>
an MME. The MME transmits a U-plane update request to a serving GW (S23). The<br>
serving GW switches a downlink path (S24) and transmits a U-plane update response<br>
to the MME (S25).<br>
[64]	The MME transmits a path switch ACK to the target eNB (S26). The target eNB<br>
transmits a resource release to the source eNB (S27). Upon receiving the resource<br>
release, the RRC layer of the source eNB reports the handover completion to the lower<br>
RLC layer and PDCP layer (S28). Then, the RLC layer of the source eNB flushes a<br>
downlink data buffer and delivers in-transit DL data packets to the target eNB. The<br>
source eNB releases resources (S29), and at this time, the handover procedure is<br>
terminated.<br>
[65]	In the conventional art, the RLC layer may deliver SDUs in sequence to an upper<br>
layer. However, if the in-sequence SDU delivery is performed at the point of time<br>
when handover execution starts in accordance with the conventional art, a data loss<br>
may occur. Thus, in the present invention, the RRC layer informs the RLC layer and<br>
the PDCP layer about the point of time of the handover, so that the RLC layer can<br>
perform the out-of-sequence SDU delivery during handover in a manner to thereby<br>
minimize a data loss. Thus, during the handover, PDCP layer may buffer non-<br>
transmitted data or reorder received data.<br>
[66]	FIGs. 8 and 9 are flow charts illustrating the process of a method for reporting<br>
handover to the RLC layer and the PDCP layer according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. In FIGs. 8 and 9, the points 'f to 'n' are connected, respectively.<br>
[67]	With reference to FIGs. 8 and 9, the method for reporting handover to the RLC layer<br>
and the PDCP layer may be divided into a method for transmitting a handover<br>
command from the source eNB to the UE, a method for informing the second layer L2<br>
of the source eNB about the handover execution, and a method for informing the<br>
second layer L2 of the UE about the handover execution. Hereinbelow, the respective<br>
processes will be discriminately described.<br>
[68]	The following paragraphs describe the method for transmitting the handover<br>
command. The handover command is made through RRC signaling from the RRC<br>
layer of the source eNB to that of the UE, so the RRC layer of the source eNB<br>
transmits the handover command by delivering a primitive PDCP AM data request, an<br>
L2 message, to the PDCP layer (S101). The PDCP layer of the source eNB delivers a<br>
primitive RLC AM data request to the RLC layer (S102).<br>
[69]	The RLC layer of the source eNB performs a segmentation/concatenation process to<br>
create RLC AMD data PDUs and transmits them to the RLC layer of the UE (S103).<br><br>
The RLC layer of the UE delivers a primitive RLC AM data indicator (RLC AM data<br>
IND) to the PDCP layer of the UE (S104), and the PDCP layer of the UE delivers a<br>
PDCP AM data indicator (PDCP AM data IND) to the RRC layer of the UE (S105). In<br>
this manner, the handover command is transmitted to the RRC layer of the UE.<br>
[70]	The RLC layer of the source eNB receives an ACK as an RLC AMD control PDU<br>
from the RLC layer of the UE (S106). The RLC layer of the source eNB cannot know<br>
whether content of data transmitted to the UE is the handover command. Thus, the<br>
RLC layer of the source eNB delivers a primitive RLC AM data CNF to the PDCP<br>
layer by using a message unit ID (MUI) between the PDCP layer and the RLC layer<br>
and informs about the transmission confirmation for the MUI (S107).<br>
[71]	The PDCP layer of the source eNB delivers L2 ACK, a reception confirmation<br>
response of the L2 message, to the RRC layer of the source eNB (S108). The RRC<br>
layer of the source eNB can recognize that the UE received the handover command<br>
and will enter the handover execution procedure. The RRC layer of the source eNB<br>
may inform the L2 layer about the start of the handover execution by receiving L2<br>
ACK.<br>
[72]	The following paragraphs describe the method for informing the second layer of the<br>
source eNB about the handover execution.<br>
[73]	The RRC layer of the source eNB delivers a primitive PDCP handover start indicator<br>
(IND) to the PDCP layer of the source eNB (S109). And the RRC layer of the source<br>
eNB transmits a primitive CRLC handover start indicator (Primitive<br>
CRLC_HO_Start_IND) to every RLC UM entity and RLC AM entity of the UE<br>
(S110). Upon receiving the primitive PDCP handover start indicator, the PDCP layer<br>
of the source eNB stops transmission of downlink data with respect to every resource<br>
block (RB) of the UE and buffers the downlink data until when the handover is<br>
completed (S111).<br>
[74]	Meanwhile, upon receiving the primitive CRLC handover start indicator, the RLC<br>
layer of the UE performs out-of-sequence SDU delivery for uplink data (S112).<br>
Separately, the PDCP layer of the source eNB transmits the buffered downlink data to<br>
the PDCP layer of the target eNB (S113). The target eNB starts buffering the received<br>
downlink data (S114).<br>
[75]	The RLC layer of the source eNB stops receiving of the data, reassembles PDUs<br>
stored in the reception buffer (Rx buffer) into SDUs, and delivers the SDUs, to the<br>
PDCP layer of the source eNB via a primitive RLC_OSD_DATA_IND (S115). SDU<br>
segments, which have failed to be reassembled into the SDUs, are deleted from the<br>
reception buffer, and the timer, a state variable, or the like, are reset (S116). In this<br>
manner, when the handover fails, the RLC layer can transmit/receive data.<br>
[76]	The PDCP layer of the source eNB transfers the uplink data blocks received in<br><br>
sequence to the S-GW (S117), and buffers the uplink data blocks received out of<br>
sequence (S118). The PDCP layer of the source eNB forwards the buffered out-<br>
of-sequence uplink data blocks to the PDCP layer of the target eNB (S119). The PDCP<br>
layer of the target eNB reorders the in-sequence uplink data blocks and the out-<br>
of-sequence uplink data blocks (S120).<br>
[77]	The following paragraphs describe the method within the UE for informing the<br>
second layer of the UE about the handover execution.<br>
[78]	When the RRC layer of the UE receives a handover command, it delivers a primitive<br>
PDCP_HO_START_IND to the PDCP layer of the UE (S121). The RRC layer of the<br>
UE transmits a primitive CRLC_HO_START_IND to every RLC UM entity and RLC<br>
AM entity (S122). The PDCP layer of the UE stops transmission of uplink data with<br>
respect to every resource block and buffers the uplink data blocks until when the<br>
handover is completed (S123). Meanwhile, the RLC layer of the UE performs out-<br>
of-sequence SDU delivery on downlink data (S124).<br>
[79]	Upon receiving the primitive CRLC_HO_START_IND from the PDCP layer of the<br>
UE, the RLC layer of the UE stops receiving downlink data and reassembles at least<br>
one PDU, included in a reception window (or OSD_Window) among PDUs stored in<br>
the reception buffer, into SDUs. And the RLC layer of the UE transfers the re-<br>
assembled SDUs to the PDCP layer of the UE via a primitive RLC_OSD_DATA_IND<br>
(S125). In this case, SDU segments, which have failed to be reassembled into the<br>
SDUs, are deleted from the reception buffer, and the timer, a state variable, or the like,<br>
are reset (S126). Through resetting, only data is deleted from the reception buffer<br>
while the RLC entity remains, and meanwhile, the RLC entity can be deleted through<br>
releasing.<br>
[80]	The PDCP layer of the UE reorders the out-of-sequence downlink data until when<br>
the handover is completed (S127), and delivers the in-sequence downlink data to an<br>
upper layer (S128).<br>
[81]	Thus, because the time point of the handover execution is informed to the RLC layer<br>
of the UE and to the RLC layer of the source eNB, the RLC layers of the UE and the<br>
source eNB can deliver their respective uplink and downlink SDUs, which are<br>
assembled out of sequence, to the PDCP layers of the UE and the source eNB, and<br>
thus, a data loss during handover can be reduced. In addition, the source eNB can not<br>
only inform the target eNB about the time and method of downlink data forwarding but<br>
also reorder and transfer the previously received uplink data to the S-GW to be<br>
forwarded to the target eNB.<br>
[82]	As mentioned above, the handover procedure is divided into a handover preparation<br>
phase, a handover execution phase, and a handover completion phase, of which the<br>
handover preparation and the handover execution have been explained. The following<br><br>
paragraphs describe the method for reporting the handover completion to the RLC<br>
layer and the PDCP layer.<br>
[83]	FIG. 10 is a flow chart illustrating the process of the method for reporting the<br>
handover completion according to an embodiment of the present invention. The<br>
handover completion is reported to the second layer L2 of the source eNB.<br>
[84]	With reference to FIG. 10, the RRC layer of the target eNB transmits resource<br>
release to the RRC layer of the source eNB (S201). The RRC layer of the source eNB<br>
can recognize that the handover has been successfully performed through the handover<br>
completion. As the handover is successfully completed, the second layer of the source<br>
eNB is not necessary any longer, so it is released. In this regard, if the RLC layer is<br>
released when the handover starts, and in this state, if the handover fails, a new con-<br>
figuration process of the RLC layer would be required, so the releasing of the RLC<br>
layer at the time of starting handover is not desirous. Consequently, the RRC layer of<br>
the target eNB transmits the resource release so that the second layer L2 of the source<br>
eNB can be released when the handover is completed.<br>
[85]	Upon receiving the resource release, the RRC layer of the source eNB delivers a<br>
primitive PDCP release request to the PDCP layer of the source eNB to release every<br>
PDCP layer with respect to the UE (S202). Also, the RRC layer of the source eNB<br>
delivers a primitive CRLC_Release_Request to the RLC layer of the source eNB to<br>
release every RLC entity of the UE (S203). The RLC layer of the UE releases every<br>
RLC entity (S204).<br>
[86]	FIG. 11 is a flow chart illustrating the process of a method for re-using the RLC layer<br>
when handover fails according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[87]	With reference to FIG. 11, if the handover fails, the source eNB and the UE should<br>
transmit/receive data again. With the handover failing, the RRC layer of the source<br>
eNB reports re-start of data transmission/reception to every radio bearer with respect to<br>
the UE through a primitive PDCP_HO_Failure_IND (S301). Meanwhile, the RLC<br>
layers have been reset, not released, and synchronization is matched at the both ends,<br>
so the RLC layers can immediately perform downlink data transmission/reception by<br>
re-using existing RLC entities without a primitive (S302, S303).<br>
[88]	The following paragraphs describe the method for operating the RLC layer which is<br>
reported on the handover execution.<br>
[89]	FIG. 12 is a flow chart illustrating the process of the method for operating the RLC<br>
layer which is reported on the handover execution according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Specifically, FIG. 12 shows an out-of-sequence SDU delivery<br>
operation of the RLC layer of a reception end, among operations of the RLC layer.<br>
Here, RLC layer of the reception end refers to an RLC layer of a UE or an eNB that<br>
receive data. Namely, RLC layer of the reception end may be the RLC layer of the<br><br>
source eNB in the uplink data transmission or the RLC layer of the UE in the downlink<br>
data transmission.<br>
[90]	With reference to FIG. 12, the process begins when the RLC layer is ready to<br>
transmit/receive data (DATA_TRANSFER_READY) (S401). The RLC layer receives<br>
a primitive CRLC_HO_START_IND from the RRC layer (S402). At this time, the<br>
RLC layer stops receiving of data (S403). The RLC layer decodes segmentation header<br>
information such as sequence information SI, sequence order SO, length information<br>
LI, or the like, to check whether PDUs, at least one data block, can be assembled re-<br>
gardless of the reception order to create reassembled data blocks, namely SDUs<br>
(S404).<br>
[91]	If the PDUs can be reassembled into SDUs, RLC layer reassembles the PDUs into<br>
SDUs (S405) and delivers the reassembled at least one SDU to the PDCP layer (S406).<br>
At this time, the RLC layer is reset by initializing state variables and the timer except<br>
configurable parameters (S407).<br>
[92]	If the PDUs are determined not to be reassembled into SDUs, the RLC layer removes<br>
the PDUs that cannot be reassembled (S408) and is re-set (S407). Thereafter, in case of<br>
handover failure, the RLC layer is ready for data transmission/reception<br>
(DATA_TRANSFER_READY) to transmit/receive data again. Here, in the resetting, a<br>
reset PDU is not transmitted to a counterpart RLC layer, it is not necessary to transition<br>
to a reset pending state. That is, because the RLC layers of the UE and the source eNB<br>
are all reset according to the handover command, there is no need to match synchro-<br>
nization between the RLC layers of the both ends. In resetting, the RLC layer of the<br>
reception end as well as that of the transmission end is reset.<br>
[93]	The following paragraphs describe the method for performing out-of-sequence SDU<br>
delivery by the RLC upon receiving a report on the handover execution.<br>
[94]	FIG. 13 describes the method for performing out-of-sequence SDUs delivery<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention. Specifically, FIG. 13 shows the<br>
case where re-transmission of data within the reception buffer of the RLC layer and re-<br>
assembling of data blocks are processed by using the reception window (Rx_Window).<br>
[95]	With reference to FIG. 13, the PDUs, data blocks, corresponding to sequential<br>
numbers 0, 1,3,4, and 5 are stored, and the size of the reception window<br>
(Rx_Window) is 10. The reception buffer corresponds to a reception buffer of the RLC<br>
layer after the primitive CRLC_HO_START_IND is received from the RRC layer. The<br>
reception buffer may be that of the RLC layer of the UE or that of the RLC layer of the<br>
eNB. VR(R) and VR(H) are state variables, and the reception window is a configurable<br>
parameter. In the reception buffer, the RLC entity may reorder the PDUs, data blocks,<br>
by the size of the reception window and reassemble them into at least one SDU, a com-<br>
bination of data blocks.<br><br>
[96]	The VR(R) indicates a sequence number (SN) which the RLC entity expects to<br>
receive in sequence, and the VR(H) indicates an SN which is 1 larger than the largest<br>
one of SNs. The PDUs corresponding to SNs 0 and 1 form an SDU, one reassembled<br>
data block, and the PDUs corresponding to SNs 4 and 5 form an SDU, another re-<br>
assembled data block. The two reassembled data blocks, SDUs, are delivered from the<br>
RLC layer to the PDCP layer. Hereinafter, the reassembled data blocks created by as-<br>
sembling one or more data blocks within the reception window regardless of the order<br>
of the SNs of the data blocks are called reassembled SDUs and the data blocks are<br>
called PDUs.<br>
[97]	After receiving the CRLC_HO_START_IND, if the PDUs of the SNs 0, 1, 3,4, and<br>
5 have been stored in the reception buffer, the RLC layer stops receiving of data,<br>
decodes segmentation headers to reassemble all the PDUs that can be reassembled into<br>
SDUs, and delivers the reassembled SDUs to the PDCP layer.<br>
[98]	The RLC layer may transmit the two reassembled SDUs to the PDCP layer,<br>
separately, or may transmit all the SDUs to the PDCP layer collectively at a time.<br>
When the SDUs are transmitted separately, information about the last SDU that is<br>
finally transmitted among the SDUs, should be provided to the PDCP layer. When the<br>
SDUs are transmitted collectively, there is no need to inform the PDCP layer about the<br>
last SDU, so the transmission efficiency can be improved.<br>
[99]	FIG. 14 is a flow chart illustrating a method for creating and delivering SDUs out of<br>
sequence according to another embodiment of the present invention. The out-<br>
of-sequence SDU creating and delivering method can be applicable for the RLC layer<br>
of the reception end (i.e., the RLC layer of the UE or that of the base station).<br>
Specifically, FIG. 14 shows the case where re-transmission of data and reassembling of<br>
data blocks in the reception buffer of the RLC layer are processed by using the<br>
OSD_Window.<br>
[100] With reference to FIG. 14, the RLC layer prepares for data transmission/reception<br>
(DATA_TRANSFER_READY) (S501). The RLC layer receives a primitive<br>
CRLC_HO_START_IND from the RRC layer (S502). The RLC layer sets an initial<br>
value of VR(OH) from the VR(H), a state variable (S503). The VR(OH) is equal to<br>
VR(H)-1. For example, if VR(H) is 8, the VR(OH) becomes 7. An operation of the<br>
OSD_Window (Out-of-Sequence Delivery Window) starts to perform out-of-sequence<br>
SDU delivery from the VR(OH).<br>
[101] The RLC layer starts a T_OSD (Timer_Out-of-Sequence Delivery), a timer<br>
informing about termination of the out-of-sequence SDUs (S504). The RLC layer<br>
receives PDU, and checks whether the SN of the received PDU is within the<br>
OSD_Window (S505). If the SN of the received PDU is within the OSD_Window, the<br>
RLC layer checks whether the received PDU has been already stored in the reception<br><br>
buffer (S506).<br>
[102] If the received PDU is not stored in the reception buffer, the RLC layer stores the<br>
received PDU in the reception buffer (S507), creates an SDU that can be reassembled<br>
regardless of the order of the received PDU, and delivers the SDU to the PDCP layer<br>
(S508). If the received PDU has been already stored in the reception buffer, the RLC<br>
layer removes the received PDU (S509),<br>
[103] If the SN of the received PDU is not in the OSD_Window (in other words, if the SN<br>
of the received PDU is larger than VR(OH)), the RLC layer advances the<br>
OSD_Window such that the VR(OH) becomes the SN of the received PDU (S510).<br>
The RLC layer stores the received PDU in the reception buffer, and removes PDUs<br>
below a lower edge of the OSD_Window (S511). The RLC layer re-starts the T_OSD<br>
(S512). Here, the reason for re-starting the T_OSD is to receive the PDUs within the<br>
OSD_Window and deliver the SDUs out of sequence until the timer expires. Thus,<br>
when the OSD_Window advances, it should wait for the T_OSD according to the new<br>
OSD_Window.<br>
[104] After re-starting the T_OSD, the RLC layer delivers the SDUs that can be re-<br>
assembled to the PDCP layer (S508). The RLC layer checks whether the re-started<br>
T_OSD has expired (S513). If the re-started T_OSD has not expired, the RLC layer<br>
continuously receives PDUs and checks whether SNs of the received PDUs are within<br>
the OSD_Window (S505).<br>
[105] If the re-started T_OSD has expired, the PDUs stored in the reception buffer are<br>
removed and the RLC layer is re-set (S514). Here, in resetting the RLC layer, a reset<br>
PDU is not transmitted to the counterpart RLC layer, so it does not need to transition to<br>
a reset pending state. When the resetting is performed, the entire RLC layers, including<br>
the RLC layer of the transmission end as well as the RLC layer of the reception end,<br>
are re-set. At this time, the RLC layer delivers an SDU transmission stop message in-<br>
dicating that no more SDU will be delivered to the PDCP layer to the PDCP layer<br>
(S515).<br>
[106] Because of the out-of-sequence SDU delivery, the delivery of the data can be<br>
guaranteed without a loss with respect to the SDUs which have been received and re-<br>
assembled at the RLC layer. In addition, because the reassembled SDUs are delivered<br>
at a time, signaling for informing the PDCP layer that the out-of-sequence delivery has<br>
been completed is not necessary, and thus, the process gain can be obtained.<br>
[107] FIG. 15 is a view showing a method for creating and delivering SDUs out of<br>
sequence in FIG. 14 according to one embodiment of the present invention. Here, it is<br>
assumed that the SNs of PDUs stored in the reception buffer before the RLC layer<br>
receives CRLC_HO_START_IND are 2,6, and 7.<br>
[108] With reference to FIG. 15, the PDUs, data blocks corresponding to the SNs 2,6, and<br><br>
7, are stored in the reception buffer, and the size of the reception window<br>
(Rx_Window) is 8 (SN=1~8). Here, the state of the reception is that of after receiving<br>
the primitive CRLC_HO_START_IND, a message indicating creation of out-<br>
of-sequence SDUs from the RRC layer. The reception buffer may be the reception<br>
buffer of the RLC layer of the UE or the reception buffer of the RLC layer of the base<br>
station. The VR(R) and the VR(H) are state Variables, and the reception window is a<br>
configurable parameter. The VR(R) is a lower edge of the reception window, and the<br>
VR(H) is an upper edge of the reception window. The size of the OSD_Window, the<br>
configurable parameter, is the same as or smaller than the reception window. This is to<br>
avoid laying a burden on the buffer of the reception end RLC layer.<br>
[109] The VR(OH), the state variable, is a value required for OSD_Window operation.<br>
When the RLC layer receives the CRLC_HO_START_IND, it sets an initial value of<br>
the VR(OH) by using the VR(H) value. For example, the initial value of the VR(OH)<br>
may be set such that VR(OH)=VR(H)-l.<br>
[110] For another example, the initial value of the VR(OH) may be set to indicate the<br>
largest one of the SNs of the PDUs received after the RLC layer receives the<br>
CRLC_HO_START_IND. The reception buffer stores PDUs of the SNs 2, 6, and 7. In<br>
case 1, if the RLC layer receives a PDU of the SN 5 after receiving the<br>
CRLC_HO_START_IND, the VR(OH) indicates the largest SN among the SNs of the<br>
received PDUs is SN 7. The RLC layer starts OSD_Window based on the set VR(OH).<br>
[111] The SN of the PDU received after the RLC layer receives CRLC_HO_START_IND<br>
is 5 and it is within the OSD_Window (namely, VR(OH)?5(SN)&gt;VR-(Size of<br>
OSD_Window)). Thus, the RLC layer stores the PDU of the SN 5 in the reception<br>
buffer, decodes segmentation header information (e.g., SI, SO, LI, etc.), and re-<br>
assembles at least one PDU regardless of the SN to create an SDU. The RLC layer<br>
delivers the SDU to the PDCP layer. Here, an SDU is delivered to the PDCP layer<br>
whenever PDUs are reassembled.<br>
[112] FIG. 16 is a view showing a method for creating and delivering SDUs out of<br>
sequence in FIG. 14 according to another embodiment of the present invention. It is<br>
assumed that the SNs of PDUs stored in the reception buffer before the RLC layer<br>
receives the CRLC_HO_START_IND are 2, 6, and 7. The case shown in FIG. 14 is<br>
different from the case shown in FIG. 13 in that the SN of a PDU received after the<br>
RLC layer receives the CRLC_HO_START_IND is 10 and it is not within the<br>
reception window, while, in the latter case (FIG. 13), the SN of the PDU received after<br>
the RLC layer receives the CRLC_HO_START_IND is within the reception window.<br>
[113] With reference to FIG. 16, the SN of the PDU received after the RLC layer receives<br>
the CRLC_HO_START_IND indicating creating of an out-of-sequence SDU from the<br>
RRC layer is 10, and it is larger than the upper edge of the OSD_Window. Thus, the<br><br>
RLC layer resets the VR(OH) from 7 to 10, and advances the OSD_Window ac-<br>
cordingly. If the PDU of the SN 10 can be reassembled to create an SDU, an SDU is<br>
created and then delivered to the PDCP layer. Meanwhile, as the PDU of the SN 2 is<br>
positioned outside the lower edge of the OSD_Window due to the advancement of the<br>
OSD_Window is determined not to be reassembled into an SDU, it is removed from<br>
the reception buffer.<br>
[114] As described above, in the handover execution, because the RLC layer delivers all<br>
the possible SDUs to the PDCP layer, re-transmission for recovering data lost between<br>
the UE and the target eNB after handover completion can be reduced. Namely, because<br>
the amount of control signals and re-transmission data transmitted to the radio channel<br>
to recover data of the PDCP layer is reduced, the overhead of radio resources can be<br>
reduced, the recovery time with respect to the lost data can be shortened, and the final<br>
throughput can be improved.<br>
[115] In addition, in a state that data transmission/reception is available after the RLC layer<br>
is reset, if handover is completed, the RLC layer can be released, and even if handover<br>
fails, an internal signaling indicating a start of data transmission/reception between the<br>
UE and the source eNB is not necessary. Also, because a control signal in a radio<br>
channel for matching synchronization between RLC layers of the both ends is not<br>
necessary, a transmission delay can be reduced and a processing gain can be obtained.<br>
[116] In the previously described embodiments, by not flushing buffers during handover as<br>
done in the prior art, and by sending out-of-sequence SDUs, the RLC layers of the UE<br>
and eNB that were established prior to handover are re-established after handover,<br>
rather than completely recreated.<br>
[117] Thus, in the present invention, for both a UM and an AM RLC entity, where<br>
possible, RLC SDUs are reassembled from lower layer PDUs and delivered to an<br>
upper layer (e.g., to the PDCP layer) in a sequence. This reassembly may include re-<br>
stricting the reassembly to PDUs with a serial number less than a threshold value and<br>
may include removing corresponding RLC headers.<br>

[5]	The method of claim 1, wherein the step of receiving a handover initiation<br>
message comprises:<br>
receiving the handover initiation message by the RRC layer; and<br>
forwarding a handover primitive from the RRC layer to the PDCP layer and to<br>
the RLC layer.<br>
[6]	The method of claim 1, wherein the step of performing handover comprises:<br>
stopping transmission of uplink data and buffering previously received uplink<br>
data by the PDCP layer upon receipt of the handover primitive; and<br>
reordering reassembled RLC SDUs by the PDCP layer.<br>
[7]	The method of claim 1, wherein the step of performing handover comprises:<br>
stopping reception of downlink data by the RLC layer upon receipt of the<br>
handover primitive.<br>
[8]	The method of claim 1, wherein the step of delivering the reassembled RLC<br>
SDUs from the RLC layer to an upper layer comprises:<br>
transferring the reassembled SDU from the RLC layer to the upper layer via a<br>
transfer primitive.<br>
[9]	The method of claim 1, further comprising:<br>
deleting a PDU which has failed to be reassembled into a SDU; and<br><br>
resetting a timer so that only data is deleted from a reception buffer while a cor-<br>
responding RLC entity remains at least until the RLC entity is released.<br>
[10]	The method of claim 1, wherein the step of reassembling RLC SDUs comprises:<br>
removing a RLC header from the at least one PDU.<br>
[11]	The method of claim 1, wherein the step of reassembling RLC SDUs comprises:<br>
reassembling RLC downlink SDUs.<br>
[12]	The method of claim 1, wherein the step of delivering the reassembled RLC<br>
SDUs from the RLC layer to an upper layer comprises:<br>
delivering the reassembled RLC SDUs from the RLC layer to the PDCP layer.<br>
[13]	The method of claim 1, wherein the step of delivering the reassembled RLC<br>
SDUs from the RLC layer to an upper layer comprises:<br>
delivering the reassembled RLC SDUs from the RLC layer to an upper layer in a<br>
sequence.<br>
[14]	A mobile terminal configured to perform handover from a source base station to<br>
a target base station, the mobile terminal having a RRC layer, a RLC layer and<br>
an PDCP layer, comprising:<br>
a processor configured to receive a handover initiation message, and to perform<br>
handover from the source base station to the target base station by reassembling<br>
RLC SDUs from at least one PDU when possible and delivering the reassembled<br>
RLC SDUs from the RLC layer to an upper layer.<br>
[15]	The mobile terminal of claim 14, wherein the processor is configured to<br>
determine whether it is possible to reassemble the RLC SDUs from the at least<br>
one PDU, and to discard the at least one PDU if it is not possible to reassemble<br>
the RLC SDUs from the at least one PDU.	<br><br><br>
A method and device for performing handover by a mobile terminal from a source base station to a target base<br>
 station, the mobile terminal having a RRC layer, a RLC layer and an PDCP layer. The method includes receiving a handover initiation<br>
 message; and performing handover from the source base station to the target base station, including reassembling RLC SDUs from<br>
