FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is related to the Imaging and Printing technology. In this branch of technology, it is particularly related to Access control list (ACL) with respect to printer that decides the printer accessibility for a particular IP address. More particularly, this invention relates to type based access control list for printing access.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Access control list (ACL), with respect to printer, allows the access to the list of the IP addresses which are mentioned as part of the configuration. Only the configured IP devices probably along with the sub net mask are allowed to get the services from printer (say the printer is exclusively accessible from these devices, while others do not have rights to access the printer). Once a job is submitted for execution, the printers database checks if ACL database is enabled. It allows the printer access if the IP Address is listed in access control list otherwise does not allow the access to printer.<br>
The ACL feature present on the printer does allow or deny the access to printer solely based on the IP address from which the job is received. It does not consider the file attributes in granting permission to print a job.<br>
Structure and Steps of Related Art<br>
Figure 2 explains the flowchart describing the ACL features. The stepwise operation of the related art is as follows:<br>
1.	Start;<br>
2.	Get the print job as submitted by the networked host;<br>
3.	Access the printer database to check if the ACL feature is enabled, If enabled and list is empty, do not accept the print job;<br>
4.	Verify that the IP address from which the print job is received has a listing in the ACL;<br><br>
5.	If the IP address is not listed in the ACL, deny the print device access.<br>
6.	Otherwise, submit the job for printing; and<br>
7.	Stop.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The Idea is to complement the ACL (which is solely based on the list of IP addresses) with attributes of the file to be printed to make a decision to sanction the printer/peripheral/MFP print-device access.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method of type based access control for printing comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	submitting a print job to a printer by a network host;<br>
(b)	checking a printer database for an ACL feature whether present or not;<br>
(c)	checking the printer database for the content of ACL;<br>
(d)	verifying IP address from which the print job is received has a listing in the ACL;<br>
(e)	extracting file attribute details as specified along with the IP address in ACL;<br>
(f)	checking if the job submitted from that particular IP address does not exceed a limitation imposed; and<br>
(g)	discarding or executing the print job accordingly.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings and the claims.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the system describing the ACL feature. Figure 2 is the flowchart describing the ACL feature.<br><br>
Figure 3 illustrates the system describing type based ACL feature. Figure 4 is the flow chart describing type based ACL feature.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiment is merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The object of the invention is to involve the file attributes along with the IP address to allow the print access to the device.<br>
The Type based access control list can be configured from user friendly HTTP interface through web pages. Upon the arrival of print job, this list is checked to grant the print device access. If the IP address is listed in the ACL but the File attributes are blank, only the configuration is allowed from that particular IP and printing is denied.<br>
Figure 4 explains the flow chart describing type based ACL feature. The stepwise operation of the invention is as follows:<br>
1.	Start;<br>
2.	Get the print job as submitted by the networked host;<br>
3.	Access the printer database to check if the ACL feature is enabled, If enabled and list is empty, do not accept the print job;<br><br>
4.	Verify that the IP address from which the print job is received has a listing in the ACL;<br>
5.	Extract the details like file type and file size and any other interested details as specified along the IP address in ACL;<br>
6.	Check to ensure that the job submitted from that particular IP address does have access rights to print particular type and does not exceed the size limitations imposed, If it violates these rules discard the print job;<br>
7.	Otherwise, submit the job for printing; and<br>
8.	Stop.<br>
This method allows better control over the printing resource. It complements the ACL feature with configurable file attributes to provide the rights for printing. This is a user-friendly HTTP interface configuration. The invented method allows the printer access depending up on the file attributes like print file type, print file size etc.<br>
As shown in figure 1, the user configures the ACL database with the list of IP addresses from which the print device is accessible using HTTP user interface and enables the ACL feature.<br>
When the print job arrives to the print device, it sees whether the IP address from which the job arrived is listed in the ACL to grant the access.<br>
In the figure 1, based on the ACL the following are permitted irrespective of the file attributes<br>
i)        Allows the IP address 1.2.3.4 to access the printer.<br>
ii)       Allows the IP address 1.1.1.1 to access the printer.<br>
iii)       Allows the IP address 2.2.2.2 to access the printer.<br>
iv)      Denies the IP address 3.3.3.3 to access the printer as it is not in ACL.<br>
v)       Denies the IP address 4.4.4.4 to access the printer as it is not in ACL.<br>
As shown in figure 3, the user configures the type based ACL data base which<br><br>
specifies the file attributes along with the list of IP addresses from which the print device is accessible and enables the ACL feature.<br>
When the print job arrives to the print device, it checks the attributes of file given for printing along with IP address from which the job arrived is listed in the ACL to grant the access.<br>
In the figure 3, based on the Type based ACL, the following operations are permitted<br>
1.	Allows only docs which does not exceed 2 MB size from 1.2.3.4<br>
2.	Allows Xls, docs and pptsfrom 1.1.1.1 which are below 512 KB in size<br>
3.	Allows all file types from 2.2.2.2 with the size limit of 5MB<br>
4.	Does not allow any print job from 3.3.3.3 only configuration is allowed<br>
5.	Does not allow user 4 (4.4.4.4) to access the printer<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a computer, mobile communication device, mobile server or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart there from.<br><br><br><br><br>
