				<td>BACKGROUND Of THE INVENTION<br>
1 Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to detergent compositions that not only effectively cleanse the hair<br>
but also impart superior wet stage and dry stage conditioning properties to the hair in a single application<br>
The present invention is further directed to a novel delivery system for delivering benefit agents onto<br>
and/or into the surface of the skin, nails, and/or hair, and methods of using such systems<br>
2. Background of the Invention and Prior Art<br>
Consumers often desire to have a hair shampoo that not only effectively cleanses the hair, but<br>
that also imparts other desirable properties, such as conditioning and lathering, to the hair Because<br>
nonionic, amphoteric and zwitterionic surfactants are relatively inferior cleansing surfactants in comparison<br>
to anionic surfactants, hair shampoos generally are formulated with the latter, which thoroughly cleanses<br>
as opposed to conditions the hair. Hence, hair that has been shampooed with an anionic surfactant-<br>
based composition usually appears unconditioned and is considered to be cosmetically unappealing.<br>
Furthermore, anionic surfactants adversely leave the hair with an undesirable harsh and "dry to the touch"<br>
feel, which is difficult to comb in either the wet or dry state. Even after complete drying, such thoroughly<br>
cleansed hair remains unsatisfactory in hair softness and "flyaway" properties. Thus, it is usually<br>
necessary to perform a post-shampoo conditioning step to such hair in order to ameliorate these<br>
undesirable physical characteristics.<br>
With the advent of so-called "two-in-one" conditioning shampoos, it became possible to condition and<br>
cleanse hair simultaneously. However, it is well known that the formulation of such "two-in-one"<br>
conditioning shampoos is difficult due to the inherent incompatibility between the cleansing anionic<br>
surfactants and the cationic conditioning agents. Unfortunately, those known "two-in-one" conditioning<br>
shampoos that have overcome the incompatibility problem disadvantageously possess inferior cleansing<br>
and conditioning properties.<br>
One known method for reducing the incompatibility between the anionic surfactants and the<br>
cationic conditioning agents is through the use of alternative, non-anionic surfactants and improved<br>
cationic conditioning agents. However, such alternative, non-anionic surfactants possess relatively inferior<br>
cleansing properties.<br>
Other efforts have concentrated on varying the types of conditioners. Cationic conditioning agents<br>
disadvantageously do not generally provide optimal overall conditioning benefits, particularly in the areas<br>
of" softness" and " wet/dry combing", when delivered as an ingredient in a shampoo composition. Water-<br>
insoluble conditioning agents, such as the non-volatile silicones that are well recognized in the art as<br>
providing a degree of softness to the hair, often results in unstable "two-in-one" formulations. See U.S.<br>
Patent 4,704,272; U.S. Patent 4,741,855; and U.S. Patent RE 34.584. Substantive cationic polymers,<br>
which are capable of depositing on the hair shaft during shampooing to impart the desired degree of<br>
manageability, disadvantageously result in formulations that give the hair a greasy feeling or "build-up" on<br>
hair. See U.S. Patent 5,221,530; U.S. Patent 5,417,965; U.S. Patent 4,292,212; and U.S. Patent<br>
4,472,297.<br>
Another important property of cleansing compositions that is desired by consumers is lathering.<br>
Consumers often associate high lathering with effective cleansing, and typically prefer high lathering<br>
shampoos to low lathering shampoos from an aesthetic standpoint. Unfortunately, many therapeutic<br>
shampoos, in particular those possessing therapeutic agents such as anti-dandruff agents, contain active<br>
agents that tend to adversely affect lathering performance. It is well known that the deposition of<br>
therapeutic aaents on the hair or skin may be improved via significantly increasing the levels of<br>
therapeutic agents in the shampoo compositions. However, not only does the use of such high levels<br>
therapeutic agents disadvantageously increase raw materials costs, but also it also reduces the<br>
latherability of the shampoo and deleteriously affects product stability. The presence of detergents in the<br>
anti-dandruff shampoos also interferes with the ability of therapeutic agents to deposit onto the hair<br>
because the detergents are designed to carry or remove oil, grease, dirt, and particulate matter from the<br>
hair and scalp during rinsing.<br>
Accordingly, it would be highly desirable to find a "two-in-one" cleansing composition capable of<br>
effectively cleansing and detangling the hair while imparting superior wet and dry combing and softness<br><br>
thereto, without creating "build-up". It would also be desirable to have a high-lathering "two-in-one"<br>
cleansing composition that not only effectively cleansed the hair but also deposited a significant amount of<br>
therapeutic agents onto the hair and skin.<br>

capable of efficiently mediating the deposition and permeation of various benefit agents, such as<br>
antidandruff agents, onto and into the skin following topical administration thereto.<br>
We have surprisingly found that the cleansing composition of the present invention is sufficiently<br>
stable to resist phase separation even though both an anionic surfactant and cationic components may be<br>
present in the composition. Furthermore, the cleansing composition not only effectively cleanses the hair<br>
due to the ability to include an anionic surfactant therein, but it also effectively deposits conditioning<br>
agents on the hair without exhibiting an excessive build-up thereon, even after repeated shampooing.<br>
Consequently, the hair is left in a more manageable, softer, shiny and overall more esthetically pleasing<br>
state after only a single application of the composition to the hair.<br>
We have further unexpectedly found that the above-described delivery system is capable of<br>
efficiently mediating the deposition and permeation of various benefit agents, such as antidandruff agents,<br>
onto and into the skin, hair, and nails, following topical administration thereto.<br>
The invention illustratively disclosed herein suitably may be practiced in the absence of any<br>

Example 9: Multiple Attribute Assessment Study<br>
A large-scale consumer study was conducted to assess a variety of attributes such as cleansing<br>
ability; hair combing attributes (e.g. wet combing and dry combing); hair softness; and lather attributes<br>
(e.g. the amount of lather and the creaminess of the lather). The four formulations tested in this study<br>
included: 1) the formulation prepared in accordance with Example 3; 2) "Pantene Pro-V" regular<br>
shampoo for normal hair commercially available from Procter &amp; Gamble; 3) "Johnson's pH 5.5" regular<br>
shampoo for normal hair commercially available from Johnson &amp; Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc.;<br>
and 4) "Johnson's pH 5.5" regular shampoo modified with a different fragrance.<br>
For each of the four above-mentioned test products, 250 female subjects between the age of 16-<br>
65 who use regular shampoos for normal hair were selected to participate in a blinded, monadic in-home<br>
use study. After using the test product for 2 weeks, each subject completed a questionnaire which asked<br>
them to rate the overall performance of the test product as well as and various attributes associated<br>
therewith.<br>
The following table is a summary of the results from study:<br>
(1): formulations identified with a "(1)" are significantly higher than those formulations identified with a "(2)"<br>
at 95% two tailed level of confidence;<br>
(3): formulations identified with a "(3)" are significantly higher than those formulations identified with a "(4)"<br>
at 80% two tail level of confidence<br>
This Example showed that the formulation of Example 3 ranked superior with respect to the<br>
subject's satisfaction in all the attributes listed above. More specifically, the formulation of Example 3<br>
performed significantly better relative to the performance of the pH 5.5 product with either the original and<br>
modified fragrance with respect to the following attributes: wet combing, dry combing, hair softness,<br>
cleansing, amount of lather and creaminess of the lather. The formulation of Example 3 also performed<br>
significantly superior relative to the performance of Pantene with respect to wet combing, amount of lather<br>
and creaminess of the lather. This Example showed that the subjects perceived that the formulation of<br>
Example 3 performed the best overall with respect to the attributes tested.<br>
Example 10: Hair Softness Assessment<br>
80 Caucasian females between the ages of 18 and 65 years old were selected to participate in a<br>
blind hair softness assessment study conducted by professional hair stylists. Prior to participating in the<br>
study, each subject did not wash their hair for a period of 24 hours prior to the study entry. All of the<br>
subjects as well as the stylist completed two different questionnaires relating to the hair quality and hair<br>
softness of each panelist before the study commenced.<br>
The following three methods were used for purposes of assessing hair softness: 1) pat and<br>
compress hair with hands; 2) run fingers through the hair; and 3) feel the hair fibers/strands with fingers.<br>
After 3 cc of the formulation of Example 3 was applied via a syringe onto the hair on each<br>
respective subject's head, the stylist then shampooed the hair of each respective subject. After this<br>
procedure was repeated twice per subject, the hair of each subject was then blown until the hair was<br>
completely dried. No other styling aides were used on hair or scalp of any of the subjects. After the<br>
drying procedure, both the respective subject as well as the stylist conducted an independent evaluation<br>
of the respective subject's hair softness, using the Softness scale as set forth in Table 10 below. The<br>
results of the evaluations are set forth in Table 11 below.<br><br>
It is evident from the data above that the formulation of Example 3 significantly increased the softness of<br>
the hair as determined independently by the stylist and the subjects.<br>
Each respective subject as well as the stylist also conducted an independent, post-drying<br>
evaluation of the degree of softness of each respective subject's hair, using the Hair Softness<br>
Quantification Sca.e as set forth in Tab.e 12 below. The results of the evaluations are set forth in Table 13<br>
below.<br>
From the data above, it is evident that the formulation of Example 3 was approximately two to three times<br>
more soft as a result of shampooing with this cleansing base.<br>
Example 11: Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) to Assess Si Deposition<br>
A formulation was prepared in accordance with the procedure set forth in Example 3, except that:<br>
a) the Biosil SPQ silicone agent was used instead at a concentration of 1 weight percent as opposed to<br>
0.2 weight percent; b) the Salcare cationic agent was used instead at a concentration of 0.05 weight<br>
percent as opposed to 0.08 weight percent; and c) the Jaguar cationic agent was used instead at a<br>
concentration of 0.1 weight percent as opposed to 0.15 weight percent.<br>
One hair tress was independently washed five times, followed by complete drying of the tress in<br>
between washings, with Pantene Pro-V 2-in-1 shampoo for normal hair that is commercially available from<br>
The Procter and Gamble Company, and another hair tress was similarly washed with the formulation of<br>
Example 3 as modified in Example 11 and dried.<br>
Scanning SIMS (secondary ion mass spectrometry) was then used to characterize the distribution<br>
of silicone ions from the silicone-containing polymers that were deposited on the hair. Details of SIMS<br>
may be found in, for example, Sibilia, John, "A Guide to Material Characterization and Chemical Analysis,"<br>
Ch. 8, 185 - 192 (1988)(hereinafter "Sibilia"), which is incorporated by reference herein. After placing one<br>
fiber of each tress in a Physical Electronics SIMS spectrometer, a primary ion beam was then scanned<br>
across the hair surface in order to ionize the Si molecules from the hair surface. The spectrometer then<br>
generated images revealing the distribution of Si ions on the surface of the hair.<br><br><br>
This procedure was repeated with several hair fibers from each tress, and representative mass<br>
spectrometer images were taken of each set of hair fibers.<br>
It is evident from FIG 1, which illustrates the distribution of Si ions on the hair surface that was<br>
washed with the Pantene Pro-V shampoo, that the Si ions were distributed over the surface hair fiber;<br>
however, the ions were primarily concentrated only under the scale ridge of the hair fiber. By contrast, it is<br>
evident from FIG. 2, which illustrates the distribution of Si ions on the hair surface that was washed with<br>
the modified Example 3 formulation, that the distribution of the Si ions is comparatively more homogenous<br>
than the distribution shown by the hair fibers washed with the Pantene Pro-V shampoo.<br>
This Example showed that the cleansing composition of the present invention yielded a more<br>
homogeneous distribution of the Silicone polymers, which thereby significantly contributed to the improved<br>
softness and body of the treated hair fibers.<br>
Example 12: X- Rav Photoelectron Spectrometer (XPS) to Assess Polymer Thickness<br>
After each tress of Example 11 was placed into a Physical Electronics x-ray photoelectron<br>
spectrometer, a beam of X-rays were scanned onto the surface of the hair fibers. Details of XPS may be<br>
found in. for example, Sibilia at 197 - 199, which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
From the percentage of Carbon and Oxygen atoms on the hair fiber and the atomic ratios of Si:C<br>
and Si:0 as determined by XPS, the thickness of the silicone polymer layer on the hair surface was<br>
estimated as shown in Table 14 below:<br>
It is evident from the results of Table 14 that the Pantene shampoo left substantially higher levels<br>
of silicon molecular residue on the hair surface in comparison to the amount of such residue left by the<br>
modified Example 3 formulation. We believe that the higher levels of silicon deposition along the hair<br>
surface may contribute to the perception of high conditioning build-up on the hair, reduction in body, and<br>
limpness. By contrast, since the hair treated with the modified Example 3 formulation left only one or two<br>
layers of silicon molecular residue on the surface of the hair fibers, we believe that hair treated with this<br>
formulation will likely possess attributes, such as enhanced wet and dry comb, improved rinsing<br>
performance and enhanced softness, that are superior relative to such properties possessed by hair<br>
treated with the Pantene shampoo.<br><br><br>
Since the performance of a hair care product largely depends upon on how the product interacts<br>
with the outermost layer of the hair fiber, this example indicated that the modified Example 3 shampoo will<br>
have a superior performance relative to that of the Pantene shampoo based upon a chemical and<br>
elemental analysis of the respective shampoo's residue left at the interface between the hair surface and<br>
the air.<br>
Example 13: Instron Ring Compression Study to Assess Hair Softness and Body<br>
The ring compression technique, which measures the energy required to pull hair tresses through<br>
various sized rings both before and after the tresses are shampooed, is a well known technique as<br>
described in Wergmann &amp; Kamuth, Principles of Polymer Science and Technology in Cosmetics and<br>
Personal Care. Chapter 12 "Evaluation Methods for Conditioned Hair" 554 - 556 (1999), which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference, for assessing hair softness and body. See, e.g., Garcia et al,<br>
"Measurement of Bulk Compressibility and Bulk Resiliency of a Hair Mass," 10,h IFTSCC Congress,<br>
Sidney, Australia (1978), which is incorporated by reference herein. The apparatus used in this technique<br>
consisted of an Instron tensile tester, model 1122, which is connected to ring devices of varying<br>
diameters.<br>
After 15 brown European hair tresses were permed with a tight perm, each tress was pulled<br>
through a metal ring having a 1.5" inner diameter twice. The energy required to pull the tress through the<br>
ring was then recorded via the Instron tester. The tresses were then manually loosened and pulled<br>
through a second metal ring having a 1.0" inner diameter twice. The energy required to pull the tress<br>
through this second ring was then recorded via the Instron tester.<br>
The "Dry Pull Energy" required to pull a tress through a given ring may be expressed in terms of<br>
the difference between the energy exerted to pull a tress through the same ring twice. This value is a<br>
measure of the degree of body or rebound of the hair tress after compression. Higher values of Dry Pull<br>
Energy indicate greater hair body.<br>
The difference between the Dry Pull Energies required to pull each tress through the 1.0" and the<br>
1.5" diameter rings, respectively, is an indication of the softness of the hair tress. The greater the<br>
difference between the difference in the Dry Pull Energies indicates that the respective hair tress is<br>
relatively more compressible or softer. The difference in the Dry Pull Energies resulting from the tress<br>
being pulled through a 1.0" inch ring and then through a 1.5" inch diameter ring are shown in Table 15 and<br>
16 below for the dry permed hair.<br>
The tresses were then shampooed once with one of the following products: 1) the formulation of<br>
Example 3; 2) "Pantene Pro-V" shampoo for normal hair; and 3) "Shiseido Super Mild" shampoo<br>
commercially available from Shiseido Fine Toiletries Co., LTD. A minimum of 3 tresses was used for each<br>
product. After the tresses were shampooed and blown completely dry, the tresses were manually<br>
loosened to separate the individual hair fibers. The tresses were then pulled through the rings in<br>
accordance with the procedures as described above.<br>
The difference in the Dry Pull Energies resulting from the tress being pulled through the same size<br>
ring twice, i..e. a 1.0" diameter ring and independently a 1.5" diameter ring, both before the hair is<br>
shampooed as well as after the hair is both shampooed and dried are shown in the Table 17 below.<br><br>
It is evident from the data above that the formulation of Example 3 showed the greatest difference<br>
in Dry Pull Energies, which indicates that this formulation is superior with respect to the other two tested<br>
commercial formulations with respect to delivering softness to the hair fibers.<br>
It is evident from the data in Table 17 above that the formulation of Example 3 showed the<br>
greatest difference in Dry Pull Energy before and after shampooing regardless of the ring size employed.<br>
This indicates that the formulation of Example 3 exhibited the greatest amount of body and/or rebound<br>
relative to that possessed by the other two commercial products.<br>
Example 14: Dynamic Vapor Sorption Studies to Determine Moisture Uptake<br>
Dynamic Vapor Sorption (DVS), Surface Measurement Systems, Ltd., was used to determine the<br>
water absorption and moisture desorption on hair fibers after application of a composition thereto.<br>
Four hair tresses were individually shampooed twice with 3 g of one of the formulations prepared<br>
in accordance with one of the following examples as shown in Table 18 below: 1) modified Example 3; 2)<br>
Example 6; 3) modified Example 7; and 4) modified Example 6. After blow drying the hair tresses for 2<br>
minutes, the tresses were then cut into segments 5-7 mm in length and weighed using a DVS Cain<br>
microbalance. The weights of the hair samples ranged between approximately 30 mg to 40 mg/sample.<br>
The hair samples were then placed into the DVS humidity chamber and equilibrated at 0% relative<br>
humidity at 25°C overnight. The relative humidity in the chamber was then increased to 10% RH until<br>
equilibration occurred. The relative humidity was then increased to 95% RH in approximately 10% RH<br>
intervals. The weight of the hair samples was then measured at each interval after each equilibration<br>
using the Cain microbalance. The relative humidity was then reduced back to 10% RH in -10% RH<br>
intervals. The weight of the hair fibers at each 10% RH interval is an indication of the water moisture<br>
absorbed and of the moisture retained by the hair samples. The water retaining capacity is the difference<br>
between the measured weight of water retained by the hair fibers at a given relative humidity during the<br><br><br>
ascent of the relative humidity versus measured weight of water retained by the hair fibers at a given<br>
relative humidity during the descent of the relative humidity. Higher values of water retaining capacity<br>
indicate the presence of surface water on the hair fiber, which tends to create limpness of the hair or<br>
increase interfiber adhesion. Lower values water retaining capacity indicated the reduction of water by the<br>
hair fiber, which tend to increase the body of the hair. A summary of the water retaining capacities is<br>
shown in Table 19 below.<br><br>
It is evident from the data above that the formulation of Example 3 as modified above in Table 18<br>
possessed superior body properties at both moderate and high relative humidity conditions. By contrast,<br>
the formulations that did not contain a cationic agent and/or a silicone agent did not perform relatively as<br>
well. This Example showed that formulations exhibiting superior body preferably contain both at least two<br>
cationic agents as well as one silicone agent.<br>
Example 15: Determination of Skin Permeation<br>
Experiments were conducted to determine the deposition of actives into the skin from various<br>
shampoo compositions. To determine penetration of actives, in vitro skin permeation studies were<br>
conducted using non-occluded Franz diffusion chambers.<br>
Human cadaver skin, microtomed to 400 urn, were mounted on Franz diffusion cells containing a<br>
receptor medium composed of a citric acid phosphate buffer or a phosphate buffered solution (depending<br>
on the active being monitored). The receptor capacity was 5 ml and the cell surface was 0.636 cm2. The<br>
receptor compartment was maintained at 37°C during the experiment.<br>
In a tube, 50 ul of each formulation as shown in Tables 1 and 2 through 6 were diluted with 50 pi<br>
of 37°C water. This solution was then rubbed onto the epidermal surface of the mounted skin for 30<br>
seconds and allowed to sit thereon for 5 minutes. The solution was then rinsed from the surface three<br>
times with 37°C water, and then swabbed twice with dry cotton swabs. At 24 hours after the topical<br>
application of the formulation, the surface of the skin was rinsed three times with methanol or distilled<br>
water soaked cotton swabs (depending on the active to be monitored), and then swabbed three times with<br>
three dry cotton swabs. After removing the skin from the diffusion cell, the epidermis and dermis were<br>
separated, chopped and placed into separate vials containing an extraction solution and sonicated in a<br>
bath sonicator for 30 minutes. After sonication of the epidermis, dermis and swabs, respectively, each<br>
sonicated sample was assayed using a Walters high pressure liquid chromatography ("HPLC").<br>
Penetration of the active into the skin was calculated based upon a percentage of the applied dose and<br>
the amount of active delivered into the epidermis or dermis per surface area. For these studies, the<br>
penetration of a lipophilic agent, elubiol was investigated. Also the penetration of a hydrophilic agent,<br>
salicylic acid was investigated.<br>
As shown in Table 20 below, the formulations investigated were the formulations prepared in<br>
accordance with the procedures set forth in Example 1, and Examples 3 through 8. Table 21 shows the<br>
amount of elubiol penetrated into the skin (epidermis and dermis ) after topical application of the<br>
formulations set forth in Table 20 in accordance with the procedure set forth above.<br><br>
This Example showed that a formulation (Formulation 4) containing 3 cationic agents and 2<br>
silicones delivered 2.466% of the applied dose of elubiol into the skin. However, when a formulation<br>
(Formulation 3) containing 2 cationic agents and 1 silicone were incorporated with the cleansing shampoo<br>
base, the percentage of elubiol delivered decreased to 1.091 %, over a 2.2 fold decrease in delivery.<br>
When no cationic agents were incorporated into the cleansing base (Formulation 6), the elubiol<br>
permeation surprisingly decreased to 0.135 %, an 18.2 fold decrease over the delivery exhibited by<br>
Formulation 4.<br>
It is also evident from this Example that there is a synergistic effect on the permeation of<br>
hydrophobic benefit agents in combination with cationic agents and water-soluble silicones. Formulations<br>
that contain either a cationic agent alone or a siliconeagent alone did not achieve the desired effect of<br>
enhanced permeation of the benefit agent. This Example showed that the combination of two or more<br>
cationic agents with one or more water.soluble silicone agents was superior with respect to permeation of<br>
hydrophobic actives into the skin.<br>
The amount of salicylic acid penetrated into the skin (epidermis and dermis) after topical<br>
application of the Formulations is set forth in Table 24, wherein the formulations were prepared in<br>
accordance with the procedure set forth above.<br>
It is evident from Tables 24 and 26 above that Formulation 4, which contained a cleansing base<br>
incorporated with three cationic agents and two water-soluble silicones agents (Example 4), delivered the<br>
highest levels of salicylic acid into the skin. It is further evident that in the formulation containing only<br>
silicone agents incorporated with the cleansing base (Example 7 and 8), the level of salicylic acid<br>
delivered into the skin was comparatively low. Notably, the cleansing base without the cationic agents<br>
and silicone agents (Example 6) possessed superior salicylic acid delivery capabilities in comparison with<br>
formulations containing only silicone agents (Example 7 and 8). Formulation 4, which contained both<br>
cationic agents and silicone agents, performed 4.9 times better than formulations without cationic agents<br>
(Example 6) and 1.62 times better than formulations containing only cationic agents (Example 1).<br>
This example demonstrated that the combination of elubiol and salicylic acid in a cleansing<br>
shampoo with 2 or more cationic agents and 1 or water soluble silicone agents performed superior with<br>
respect to delivering the elubiol and salicylic acid into the skin. Thus, the composition of this invention<br>
affords a method of regulating the delivery of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic actives into the skin.<br>
