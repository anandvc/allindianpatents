				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of communications, and more particularly<br>
to a method and a device for controlling power amplification.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A radio frequency (RF) power amplifier is a key component of a network equipment<br>
(NE) in a radio communication system. The RF power amplifier is substantially an energy<br>
converter, which converts Direct Current (DC) energy of a power source into RF energy for<br>
transmission through an antenna. A ratio of the RF power to the DC power provided by<br>
the power source is referred to as the efficiency ? of the power amplifier, and the<br>
efficiency is an important factor of the power amplifier. Taking the power amplifier in a<br>
base station for example, the efficiency is directly associated with factors such as the power<br>
source, heat dissipation, size. fans, and noises of the base station system. A high<br>
efficiency of the power amplifier improves the reliability of the base station system and<br>
reduces the cost of the base station equipment. For a telecommunication operator, a high<br>
efficiency of the power amplifier can effectively reduce the cost of system operation and<br>
subsequent maintenance.<br>
The efficiency ? of a power amplifier is calculated according to the following<br>
formulae:<br><br>
where Vdd is a voltage provided by a DC power source, and Id is a current<br>
provided by the DC power source.<br>
In the whole power conversion process, a part of the DC energy is inevitably<br>
converted into heat, which will be wasted. Therefore, the actual efficiency of the power<br>
amplifier is always lower than 100%.<br>
In a current base station power amplifier, to consider the efficiency and linearity<br>
indexes comprehensively, a static working point of the power amplifier is normally set to<br>
Class A or Class AB. that is. a static working current of the power amplifier Idq&gt;0A<br>
Taking a laterally diffused metal oxide semiconductor (LDMOS) for example, the LDMOS<br>
is a power amplifier transistor widely applied at present. If a voltage bias of a power<br>
amplifier using the power amplifier transistor is in Class AB. and the power amplifier is in a<br>
saturated output state, the efficiency is the highest. However, with the decrease of the<br>
output power, the efficiency will be reduced gradually. That is, the ratio of the heat<br>
converted from the DC energy provided by the power source will rise with the decrease of<br>
the efficiency of the power amplifier.<br>
When the power amplifier does not output any RF power, the dissipated DC power<br>
is as follows:<br><br>
for the base station system, the state in which the power amplifier does not output<br>
any RF power appears frequently (for example, when no subscriber accesses the system).<br>
According to the above analysis, at this time, for a common Class A or Class AB amplifier,<br>
the static power is wasted, and the overall efficiency of the power amplifier is lowered.<br>
To improve the overall efficiency of the power amplifier, the following solution is<br>
adopted in the prior art. When the power amplifier is in a state with no RF power output,<br>
a voltage of a drain electrode of the power amplifier transistor in the power amplifier is<br>
adjusted to 0 V. It is known from Formula [3] that, at this time, Power-dc = 0W, i.e. the<br>
dissipated DC power is 0 W.<br>
Though the overall efficiency of the power amplifier is increased to some extent by<br>
using the above method, the inventors found the following problems from the solution.<br>
1) The response time is long, the solution is applicable to few scenarios only, and<br>
the improvement to the efficiency of the power amplifier is limited.<br>
Normally the drain electrode of the power amplifier transistor operates in the state<br>
of high voltage (for example. 28 V) and large current (for example. 10 A), so the power<br>
supply unit thereof must be a power source capable of providing a high power. Limited by<br>
factors such as the charging and discharging of high-capacitance capacitors and the<br>
soft-start mechanism to ensure security, the time for establishing or disabling the output<br>
voltage of such a power source is often several seconds or even several tens of seconds.<br>
However, in normal situations, time periods required by services of the base station<br>
system are much shorter than one second. For example, in a Global System for Mobile<br>
Communications (GSM), the timeslot period of each user is only 577 us. Subscribers may<br>
access (the power amplifier needs to switch on) or not access (the power amplifier needs to<br>
switch off) the GSM system in a timeslot period, while the solution of controlling the<br>
voltage of a drain electrode cannot track such a fast change. To ensure normal<br>
communications, the voltage on the drain port of the power amplifier transistor must remain<br>
at the normal operating voltage without changes for a long time, and thus a part of the static<br>
power will be dissipated<br>
In view of the above, the solution of controlling the voltage of a drain electrode is<br>
applicable to very few scenarios in practice. Normally, this solution is adopted only when<br>
no subscriber accesses the system for a long time at night. Therefore, the improvement to<br>
the efficiency of the power amplifier is unobvious. and the power-saving effect is limited.<br>
2) The control circuit is complicated with a high cost and low reliability.<br>
The solution of controlling the voltage of a drain electrode deals with signals with a<br>
high voltage and large current, so many high-power elements are needed. Therefore, the<br>
circuit implementation is complicated, the cost is high, and the reliability is low, which may<br>
easily cause potential quality problems.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the embodiments of present invention provide a method and a device<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
In the embodiments of the present invention, a voltage signal is output to a grid<br>
electrode or a base electrode of a power amplifier transistor according to the state of an NE,<br>
and the power amplifier transistor can switch on or switch off according to the state of the<br>
NE under the control of the voltage signal, so as to improve the efficiency of a power<br>
amplifier.<br>
The technical solutions of the present invention are described in detail below in the<br>
embodiments with reference to some accompanying drawings.<br>
A method for controlling power amplification is provided in a first embodiment of<br>
the present invention. Referring to FIG. 1, the method includes the following steps.<br>
Step 8101. outputting a voltage signal according to the state of an NE.<br>
In this step, information related to the NE is obtained firstly. The information<br>
includes signaling or service information or external control signal or internal clock signal<br>
of the NE. and the state of the NE can be determined according to one or multiple<br>
combinations of the information. The NE may be in an Idle or a Busy state. The Idle<br>
state indicates that the NE is not required to output an RF signal, for example, the NE is not<br>
accessed by any subscriber or in an idle timeslot. or receives a control signal for enabling<br>
the power amplifier to switch off. The Busy state indicates that the NE is required to<br>
output an RF signal, for example, the NE is accessed by subscribers, in a non-idle timeslot.<br>
or receives a control signal for enabling the power amplifier to switch on. Taking a base<br>
station for example, when a terminal accesses the base station, if a channel type assigned in<br>
the signaling is a main broadcast control channel (BCCH) or a packet data traffic channel<br>
(PDTCH). it is determined that the NE is in the Busy state, that is, the NE needs to output<br>
an RF signal.<br>
After the state of the NE is obtained, the voltage signal is output according to the<br>
state. When the system is in the Busy state, the voltage signal corresponding to the Busy<br>
state is output: and when the system is in the Idle state, the voltage signal corresponding to<br>
the Idle state is output. The value of the voltage signal varies with different power<br>
amplifier transistors. For example, if the power amplifier transistor is an N-channel<br>
LDMOS, the voltage signal corresponding to the Busy state may be 2 V to 5 V, and the<br>
voltage signal corresponding to the Idle state may be 0 V to 2 V. Besides, if the power<br>
amplifier transistor is an N-channel depletion-mode gallium arsenide metal-semiconductor<br>
field effect transistor (GaAs MESFET), the voltage signal corresponding to the Busy state<br>
may be -4 V to 0 V, and the voltage signal corresponding to the Idle state may be -5 V to -4<br>
V.<br>
Step 8102. applying the voltage signal to a grid electrode or a base electrode of at<br>
least one power amplifier transistor in a power amplifier<br>
When the NE is in the Busy state, the voltage signal corresponding to the Busy state<br>
is applied to the grid electrode or the base electrode of one or more power amplifier<br>
transistors in ;.hc power amplifier. At this time, the power amplifier transistor works in an<br>
amplification range, and the power amplifier has RF power output. When the NE is in the<br>
Idle state, the voltage signal corresponding to the Idle state is applied to the grid electrode<br>
or the base electrode of one or more power amplifier transistors in the power amplifier. At<br>
this time, the power amplifier transistor switches off with no RF power output, and thus<br>
does not have static power dissipation.<br>
After the method of the present invention is described in the above embodiment, the<br>
difference between DC power dissipation of the power amplifier in the method of the<br>
present invention and that of the power amplifier in the prior art is given below with<br>
specific examples.<br>
It is assumed that FIG. 2 is a schematic view of the relationship between the RF<br>
power output of a Class A or Class AB power amplifier in eight timeslot periods and<br>
timeslots according to the first embodiment of the present invention, in which the Pf axis<br>
represents the RF output power, and the t axis represents the timeslots. The timeslots 2, 4,<br>
and 6 are idle timeslots. during which the power amplifier does not have RF power output;<br>
while the timeslots 1. 3. 5. 7. and 8 are non-idle timeslots. during which the power amplifier<br>
has RF power output.<br>
FIG. 3 is a schematic view of the relationship between the power dissipation of a<br>
conventional Class AB power amplifier in the prior art and the timeslots in the RF power<br>
output state as shown in FIG. 2. In FIG. 3, the Pq1 axis represents the power dissipation of<br>
the power amplifier, the Vg1 axis represents a grid electrode bias voltage of the power<br>
amplifier transistor in the power amplifier, and the dashed line Vgsl represents a current<br>
grid bias voltage of the power amplifier transistor. As shown in FIG. 3, Vgsl is constant<br>
(normally between 2 V and 5 V). and the power dissipation is not zero in the idle timeslots<br>
2. 4. and 6.<br>
FIG. 4 is a schematic view of the relationship between the power dissipation of the<br>
Class A or Class AB power amplifier utilizing the method embodiment of the present<br>
invention and the timeslots in the RF power output state as shown in FIG. 2. In FIG. 4. the<br>
Pq2 axis represents the power dissipation of the power amplifier, the Vg2 axis represents a<br>
grid electrode bias voltage of the power amplifier transistor in the power amplifier, and the<br>
dashed line Vgs2 represents a current grid electrode bias voltage of the power amplifier<br>
transistor. As shown in FIG. 4. Vgs2 varies with the state of the timeslots. In the idle<br>
timeslots 2, 4. and 6. Vgs2 is between 0 V and 2 V. the power amplifier transistor switches<br>
off, and (he power dissipation of the power amplifier is zero; while in the non-idle timeslots<br>
1, 3. 5, 7, and 8. Vgs2 is between 2 V and 5 V, the power amplifier transistor works in an<br>
amplification range, and the power amplifier has RF power output.<br>
If the power amplifier transistor in the power amplifier is a bipolar junction<br>
transistor (BJT). the efficiency of the power amplifier can still be improved by using the<br>
above method, and the difference lies in that Vgs2 represents a base bias voltage of the BJT,<br>
and the value of Vgs2 in the idle and non-idle timeslots can be adjusted according to<br>
specific parameters of the transistor.<br>
As described above, the voltage of the voltage signal (for example, Vgs2) is<br>
relatively low, so that the voltage control circuit does not need high-capacitance capacitors<br>
or high-inductance inductors, and the response time can meet the requirements for the<br>
timeslot period of the subscribers. By using the method embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the power dissipation of the power amplifier is much lower than that of the<br>
conventional Class AB power amplifier in the prior art, so as to significantly improve the<br>
efficiency of the power amplifier.<br>
The method for controlling power amplification is applicable to an RF transmitter,<br>
and is also applicable to an NE including, but not limited to, a base station, a wireless<br>
terminal, a server a switch, and a base station controller.<br>
A system lor controlling power amplification is provided in a second embodiment of<br>
the present invention. Referring to FIG. 5, the system includes a main control unit 200, a<br>
voltage control unit 210. and a power amplifier unit, in which the power amplifier unit<br>
includes a power amplifier 220.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6. the main control unit 200 is adapted to obtain the state of an NE.<br>
and send a voltage control signal according to the state.<br>
The main control unit 200 includes an information acquisition module 202, a state<br>
acquisition module 204, and a signal sending module 206.<br>
The information acquisition module 202 is adapted to acquire information related to<br>
the NE through a port A21. The information includes signaling or service information or<br>
external control signals or internal clock signals of the NE. Priorities of the signals may<br>
be set in the main control unit, for example, the priority of the external control signals is set<br>
to the highest, and thus, when a fault alarm signal or a signal for forcedly turning off the<br>
transmitter or power amplifier is received, even if the NE is in the non-idle timeslots as<br>
indicated by the signaling, the main control unit still determines the state of the NE as Idle<br>
according to the priority.<br>
The state acquisition module 204 is adapted to determine a current state of the NE<br>
according to the above information. The NE may be in an Idle state or a Busy state. The<br>
Idle stale indicates that the NE is not required to output an RF signal, for example, the NE<br>
is not accessed by any subscriber, in an idle timeslot, or receives a control signal for<br>
enabling the power amplifier to switch off. The Busy state indicates that the NE is<br>
required to output an RF signal, for example, the NE is accessed by subscribers, in a<br>
non-idle timeslot. or receives a control signal for turning on the power amplifier.<br>
The signal sending module 206 is adapted to send the voltage signal according to<br>
the state of the NE. For example, the voltage control signal corresponding to the Idle state<br>
is represented by a logic voltage "0". and the voltage control signal corresponding to the<br>
Busy state is represented by a logic voltage "1". Further, an inverse logic expression may<br>
also be adopted, that is the voltage control signal corresponding to the Idle state is<br>
represented by a logic voltage "1", and the voltage control signal corresponding to the Busy<br>
state is represented by a logic voltage "0". The voltage control signal is output from a port<br>
A22.<br>
The main control unit 200 may be an integrated chip or a functional module of an<br>
integrated chip, for example, a functional module integrated in a control chip of a wireless<br>
terminal such as a mobile phone. The main control unit 200 may also be a part of a base<br>
station controller, and the voltage control signal is directly sent to a transmitter on a base<br>
station side through a signaling channel by the base station controller. The main control<br>
unit 200 may also be directly integrated on a board of a transmitter.<br>
The voltage control unit 210 is connected to the main control unit 200, and adapted<br>
to receive the voltage control signal from the main control unit 200 through a port B21,<br>
obtain the voltage signal according to the voltage control signal, and apply the obtained<br>
voltage signal to a grid electrode or a base electrode of a power amplifier transistor 221 in<br>
the power amplifier 220 through a port B22. The value of the voltage signal varies for<br>
different power amplifier transistors. For example, when the power amplifier transistor is<br>
an N-channel LDMOS. the voltage signal corresponding to the voltage control signal "1"<br>
(the Busy state) may be 2 V to 5 V. and the voltage signal corresponding to the voltage<br>
control signal "0" (the Idle state) may be 0 V to 2 V. When the power amplifier transistor<br>
is an N-channel depletion-mode GaAs MESFET, the voltage signal corresponding to the<br>
voltage control signal "1" (the Busy state) may be -4 V to 0 V, and the voltage signal<br>
corresponding to the voltage control signal "0" (the Idle state) may be -5 V to -4 V. The<br>
voltage control unit may be formed by an analog switch circuit or a digital-to-analog<br>
converter circuit. The voltage control unit may be set separately or integrated in the main<br>
control unit as a functional module.<br>
The power amplifier 220 is adapted to switch on or switch off according to the bias<br>
voltage signal applied to the grid electrode or a base electrode of the power amplifier<br>
transistor 221 therein. A port C21 of the power amplifier 220 is adapted to receive an RF<br>
signal, a port C22 is adapted to connect a constant power supply voltage Vdd, and a port<br>
C23 is adapted to output the RF signal.<br>
The power amplifier 220 may be a Class A or Class AB amplifier, and the power<br>
amplifier transistor 221 therein includes, but is not limited to. an LDMOS, a GaAs<br>
MESFET. a BJT. a junction Held effect transistor (JFET). or a gallium nitride (GAN)<br>
transistor.<br>
When the power amplifier is formed by multiple power amplifier transistors, the<br>
voltage control unit enables the power amplifier to switch on or switch off by controlling<br>
the grid voltage or base voltage of the one or multiple power amplifier transistors in the<br>
power amplifier. As shown in FIG. 7, a main control unit 300 obtains information related<br>
to an NE through a port A31, a port A32 sends a voltage control signal to a port B31 of a<br>
voltage control unit 3 10. the voltage control unit 310 responds to the signal, and a port B32<br>
outputs a voltage signal to a grid electrode or a base electrode of a power amplifier<br>
transistor 32 1 and a grid electrode or a base electrode of a power amplifier transistor 322 in<br>
a power amplifier 320. A port C31 of the power amplifier 320 is adapted to receive an RF<br>
signal, a port (32 is adapted to connect a constant power supply voltage Vdd, and a port<br>
C33 is adapted to output the RF signal. In practice, the power amplifier transistors<br>
connected to and controlled by the voltage control unit may be determined according to the<br>
internal structure of the power amplifier. When multiple power amplifier transistors need<br>
to be controlled, multiple voltage signals are used, which vary according to specific<br>
conditions of the power amplifier.<br>
As the voltage control unit processes low-voltage and low-current signals, the<br>
circuit structure is simple, and the manufacturing cost is low. Moreover, as the circuit<br>
includes fewer components, the stability of the circuit is also improved.<br>
The system for controlling power amplification is applicable to an RF transmitter,<br>
and is also applicable to an NE such as a base station or a wireless terminal. When the<br>
system lor controlling power amplification is applied in the wireless terminal, in order to<br>
simplify the equipment connection and improve the integration level, the voltage control<br>
unit may he directly integrated in the main control unit, or the main control unit, the voltage<br>
control unit, and the power amplifier unit may be integrated in a chip or in a functional<br>
module of a chip.<br>
A system for controlling power amplification is provided in a third embodiment of<br>
the present invention, in which a voltage control unit is integrated in a main control unit.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, the system includes a main control unit 400 and a power amplifier unit,<br>
and the power amplifier unit includes a power amplifier 420.<br>
A voltage control unit 401 is integrated in the main control unit 400. A port A41 of<br>
the main control unit 400 is an information input port adapted to obtain information related<br>
to an Nfi. The information includes at least one of signaling, service information, external<br>
control signals, and internal clock signals of the NE. A current state of the NE is<br>
determined according to the above information. A bias voltage signal is applied to a grid<br>
electrode or a base electrode of a power amplifier transistor 421 according to the current<br>
state of the NE.<br>
The NE may be in an Idle state or a Busy state. The Idle state indicates that the NE<br>
is not required to output an RF signal, for example, the NE is not accessed by any<br>
subscriber, in an Idle limeslot, or receives a control signal for turning off the power<br>
amplifier. The Busy state indicates that the NE is required to output an RF signal, for<br>
example, the NE is accessed by subscribers, in a non-idle timeslot, or receives a control<br>
signal for turning on the power amplifier. Taking a GSM mobile terminal for example, in<br>
the process that the terminal establishes connections, the network side delivers a service<br>
channel assignment message, in which sequence numbers of timeslots available to the<br>
terminal are specified. The main control unit obtains the message, and determines whether<br>
the terminal is in a Busy state according to the message and the internal clock when the<br>
specified timeless arrive.<br>
The voltage control unit 401 integrated in the main control unit 400 outputs a<br>
voltage signal according to the state of the NE. and the voltage signal is applied to the grid<br>
electrode or the base electrode of the power amplifier transistor 421 through a port A42.<br>
The value of the voltage signal varies for different power amplifier transistors. For<br>
example, if the power amplifier transistor is an N-channel LDMOS, the voltage signal<br>
corresponding to the Busy state of the NE may be 2 V to 5 V, and the voltage signal<br>
corresponding to the Idle state may be 0 V to 2 V. If the power amplifier transistor is an<br>
N-channel depletion-mode GaAs MESFET, the voltage signal corresponding to the Busy<br>
stale may be -4 V to 0 V. and the voltage signal corresponding to the Idle state may be -5 V<br>
to -4 V.<br>
The power amplifier 420 is adapted to switch on or switch off according to the<br>
voltage signal applied to the grid electrode or the base electrode of the power amplifier<br>
transistor 421 therein. A port C41 of the power amplifier 420 is adapted to receive an RF<br>
signal, a port C42 is adapted to connect a constant power supply voltage Vdd, and a port<br>
C43 is adapted to output the RF signal.<br>
The power amplifier 420 may be a Class A or Class AB amplifier, and the power<br>
amplifier transistor 421 therein includes, but is not limited to. an LDMOS. a GaAs<br>
MESFEL a BJI. a JFET. or a GAN transistor.<br>
The voltage control unit is directly integrated in the main control unit. Thus, the<br>
integration level of the equipment is improved, the configuration and circuit connection are<br>
simplified, and the delay of the control signal is significantly shortened to make the<br>
response to the voltage signal more timely. In addition, the function of the main control<br>
unit 400 may be realized through a dedicated integrated circuit, a central processing unit<br>
(CPU), or a field programmable gate array (FPGA).<br>
The system for controlling power amplification is applicable to an RF transmitter,<br>
and is also applicable to an NE such as a base station or a wireless terminal.<br>
According to actual requirements, the voltage control unit may also be directly<br>
integrated in the power amplifier.<br>
A system for controlling power amplification is provided in a fourth embodiment of<br>
the present invention, in which a voltage control unit is integrated in a power amplifier.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9. the system includes a main control unit 500 and a power amplifier 520.<br>
A port A3 1 of the main control unit 500 is an information input port adapted to<br>
obtain information related to an NE. The information includes at least one of signaling,<br>
service information, external control signals, and internal clock signals of the NE. A<br>
current state of the NE is determined according to the above information.<br>
The NE may be in an Idle state or a Busy state. The Idle state indicates that the NE<br>
is not required to output an RF signal, for example, the NE is not accessed by any<br>
subscriber, in an idle timeslot, or receives a control signal for turning off the power<br>
amplifier. The Busy state indicates that the NE is required to output an RF signal, for<br>
example, the NE is accessed by subscribers, in a non-idle timeslot. or receives a control<br>
signal for turning on the power amplifier.<br>
The main control unit 500 sends a voltage control signal according to the state of the<br>
NE. For example, the voltage control signal corresponding to the Idle state is represented<br>
by a logic voltage "0", and the voltage control signal corresponding to the Busy state is<br>
represented by a logic voltage "1". Further, an inverse logic expression may also be<br>
adopted, that is. the voltage control signal corresponding to the Idle state is represented by a<br>
logic voltage "1" and the voltage control signal corresponding to the Busy state is<br>
represented by a logic voltage "0". The voltage control signal is output from a port A52.<br>
The main control unit 500 may be an integrated chip or a functional module of an integrated<br>
chip. The main control unit may also be a part of a base station controller, and the voltage<br>
control signal is directly sent to a transmitter on a base station side through a signaling<br>
channel by the base station controller. The main control unit may also be integrated in a<br>
baseband signal processing subsystem of a base station, or directly integrated on a board of<br>
a transmitter.<br>
A voltage control unit 522 is integrated in the power amplifier 520. A port C54 of<br>
the voltage control unit 522 receives the voltage control signal from the main control unit<br>
500. The voltage control unit 522 responds to the voltage control signal, and applies a<br>
voltage signal to a grid electrode or a base electrode of a power amplifier transistor 521.<br>
The power amplifier transistor switches on or switches off according to the voltage signal.<br>
The value of the voltage signal varies for different power amplifier transistors. For<br>
example, when the power amplifier transistor is an N-channel LDMOS, the voltage signal<br>
corresponding to the voltage control signal "1" (the Busy state) may be 2 V to 5 V, and the<br>
voltage signal corresponding to the voltage control signal "0" (the Idle state) may be 0 V to<br>
2 V. If the power amplifier transistor is an N-channel depletion-mode GaAs MESFET, the<br>
voltage signal corresponding to the voltage control signal "1" (the Busy state) may be -4 V<br>
to 0 V. and the voltage signal corresponding to the voltage control signal "0" (the Idle state)<br>
may be -5 V to -4 V. A port C51 of the power amplifier 520 is adapted to receive an RF<br>
signal, a port C52 is adapted to connect a constant voltage Vdd of power source, and a port<br>
C53 is adapted to output the RF signal.<br>
The power amplifier 520 may be a Class A or Class AB amplifier, and the power<br>
amplifier transistor 521 therein includes, but is not limited to, an LDMOS, a GaAs<br>
MFSELI. a BJL a JEET, or a CAN transistor. The power amplifier 520 may also be an<br>
integrated circuit, and the voltage control unit therein is implemented through a<br>
digital-to-analog converter circuit or an analog switch circuit.<br>
The voltage control unit is integrated in the power amplifier unit (which includes the<br>
power amplifier). Thus, the universality of the power amplifier unit is improved.<br>
Moreover, as the transmission path of the voltage signal is short, the interference to the<br>
voltage signal caused by other signals is effectively prevented. Therefore, this<br>
configuration is applicable when the main control unit is at a long distance to the power<br>
amplifier.<br>
The sytem for controlling power amplification is applicable to an RF transmitter,<br>
and is also applicable to an NE such as a base station or a wireless terminal.<br>
A system lor controlling power amplification is provided in a fifth embodiment of<br>
the present invention, in which multiple power amplifiers are operated independently or<br>
connected in parallel in operation. Referring to FIG. 10. the system includes a main<br>
control unit 600. a voltage control unit 610, and a power amplifier unit formed by a first<br>
power amplifier 620. a second power amplifier 630, and a third power amplifier 640.<br>
A port A61 of the main control unit 600 is an information input port adapted to<br>
obtain information related to an NE. The information includes at least one of signaling,<br>
service information, external control signals, and internal clock signals of the NE. A<br>
current state of the NE is determined according to the above information.<br>
The NE may be in an Idle state or a Busy state. The Idle state indicates that the NE<br>
is not required to output an RF signal, for example, the NE is not accessed by any<br>
subscriber, in an idle timeslot, or receives a control signal for turning off the power<br>
amplifier. The Busy state indicates that the NE is required to output an RF signal, for<br>
example, the NE is accessed by subscribers, in a non-idle timeslot, or receives a control<br>
signal lor turning on the power amplifier.<br>
The main control unit 600 sends a voltage control signal according to the state of the<br>
NE. For example, the voltage control signal corresponding to the Idle state is represented<br>
by a logic voltage "0", and the voltage control signal corresponding to the Busy state is<br>
represented by a logic voltage "1". Further, an inverse logic expression may also be<br>
adopted, that is. the voltage control signal corresponding to the Idle state is represented by a<br>
logic voltage " 1". and the voltage control signal corresponding to the Busy state is<br>
represented by a logic voltage "0". The voltage control signal is output from a port A62.<br>
When the power amplifier unit is formed by multiple power amplifiers, the main control<br>
unit outputs multiple independent voltage control signals, and the logic expression of each<br>
voltage control signal is the same as the preceding description. The main control unit 600<br>
may be an integrated chip or a functional module of an integrated chip. The main control<br>
unit may also be a part of a base station controller, and the voltage control signal is directly<br>
sent to a transmitter on a base station side through a signaling channel by the base station<br>
controller. The main control unit may also be directly integrated on a board of a<br>
transmitter.<br>
The voltage control unit 610 is connected to the main control unit 600, and adapted<br>
to receive the voltage control signals from the main control unit 600 through a port B61,<br>
obtain voltage signals according to the voltage control signals, and apply the obtained<br>
voltage signals to grid electrodes of the power amplifier transistors 621, 631, and 641 or<br>
base electrodes of the power amplifier transistors 621. 631. and 641 through a port B62,<br>
respectively. Here, the port B62 can output three independent voltage signals to control<br>
the three power amplifiers independently, or output only one voltage signal to control the<br>
three power amplifiers uniformly. The value of the voltage signals varies for different<br>
power amplifier transistors. For example, when the power amplifier transistors are<br>
N-channel LDMOSs. the voltage signals corresponding to the voltage control signals "1"<br>
(the Busy state) may be 2 V to 5 V. and the voltage signals corresponding to the voltage<br>
control signals '0" (the Idle state) may be 0 V to 2 V. If the power amplifier transistors are<br>
N-channel depletion-mode GaAs MESFETs. the voltage signals corresponding to the<br>
voltage control signals "1" (the Busy state) may be -4 V to 0 V, and the voltage signals<br>
corresponding to the voltage control signals "0" (the Idle slate) may be -5 V to -4 V. The<br>
voltage control Link may be formed by an analog switch circuit or a digital-to-analog<br>
convener circuit. The voltage control unit may be set separately or integrated in the main<br>
control unit or the power amplifier unit as a functional module.<br>
When the fust power amplifier 620, the second power amplifier 630, and the third<br>
power amplifier 640 operate independently, ports C61, C64, and C67 receive three<br>
independent RF signals, and ports C63, C66. and C69 output three amplified RF signals,<br>
respectively. Each of the power amplifiers is adapted to switch on or switch off according<br>
to the voltage signal applied to the grid electrode or the base electrode of the power<br>
amplifier transfer therein. The first power amplifier 620. the second power amplifier 630,<br>
and the third power amplifier 040 may respectively include one or more power amplifier<br>
transistors, and ports C62, C65. and C68 thereof are connected to a constant power supply<br>
voltage Vdd respectively.<br>
When the power amplifiers operate in parallel, the ports C61 ,C64, and C67 receive<br>
one RF signal, which is then divided into three signals. The three signals are amplified by<br>
the three power amplifiers, then combined by the ports C63, C66, and C69, and output as<br>
one RF signal. Each of the power amplifiers is adapted to switch on or switch off<br>
according to a bias voltage signal applied to the grid electrode or the base electrode of the<br>
power amplifier transistor therein. The first power amplifier 620, the second power<br>
amplifier 630. and the third power amplifier 640 may respectively include one or more<br>
power amplifier transistors, and the ports C62, C65, and C68 thereof are connected to a<br>
constant voltage Vdd of a power source respectively. The main control unit controls, via<br>
the voltage signal, the number of the power amplifiers which are in the On state, according<br>
to the input RF power, so as to improve the overall efficiency of the power amplifier unit.<br>
For example, only one power amplifier switches on when the power of the input RF signal<br>
is small, and three power amplifiers are turned on when the power of the input RF signal is<br>
large. The three power amplifiers may be controlled uniformly by one voltage signal, so<br>
as to double the output power.<br>
The first power amplifier 620, the second power amplifier 630, and the third power<br>
amplifier 640 may be Class A or Class AB amplifiers, and the power amplifier transistors<br>
therein include, but are not limited to, LDMOS, GaAs MESFET, BJT, JFET, or GAN<br>
transistors.<br>
The main control unit outputs multiple voltage signals through the voltage control<br>
unit, which realizes the collective control over multiple power amplifiers, saves the<br>
equipment cost, and improves the efficiency of the power amplifiers.<br>
The system for controlling power amplification is applicable to an RF transmitter,<br>
and is also applicable to an NE such as a base station or a wireless terminal.<br>
Sometimes, multiple power amplifiers need to be connected in series in operation to<br>
obtain a higher gain. A system for controlling power amplification is provided in a sixth<br>
embodiment of the present invention, in which power amplifiers are connected in series in<br>
operation. Referring to FIG. 11, the system includes a main control unit 700. a voltage<br>
control unit 710, and a power amplifier unit formed by a first power amplifier 720, a second<br>
power amplifier 730, and a third power amplifier 740.<br>
A port A71 of the main control unit 700 is an information input port adapted to<br>
obtain information related to an NE. The information includes at least one of signaling,<br>
service information, external control signals, and internal clock signals of the NE. A<br>
current state of the NE is determined according to the above information.<br>
The NE may be in an Idle state or a Busy state. The Idle state indicates that the NE<br>
is not required to output an RF signal, for example, the NE is not accessed by any<br>
subscriber, in an idle timeslot. or receives a control signal for turning off the power<br>
amplifier. The Busy state indicates that the NE is required to output an RF signal, for<br>
example, the NE is accessed by subscribers, in a non-idle timeslot, or receives a control<br>
signal for turning on the power amplifier.<br>

NE. For example, the voltage control signal corresponding to the Idle state is represented<br>
by a logic voltage "0". and the voltage control signal corresponding to the Busy state is<br>
represented by a logic voltage "1". Further, an inverse logic expression may also be<br>
adopted, that is. the voltage control signal corresponding to the Idle state is represented by a<br>
logic voltage "1". and the voltage control signal corresponding to the Busy state is<br>
represented by a logic voltage '"0". The voltage control signal is output from a port A72.<br>
If the power amplifier unit is formed by multiple power amplifiers, the main control unit<br>
outputs multiple independent voltage control signals, and the logic expression of each<br>
voltage control signal is the same as the preceding description. The main control unit 700<br>
may be an integrated chip or a functional module of an integrated chip. The main control<br>

voltage signals to grid electrodes of the power amplifier transistors 721, 731, and 741 or<br>
base electrodes of the power amplifier transistors 721, 731, and 741 through a port B72,<br>
respectively. Here, the port B72 can output three independent voltage signals to control<br>
the three power amplifiers independently, or output only one voltage signal to control the<br>
three power amplifiers uniformly. In addition, for the power amplifiers connected in series,<br>
the voltage signal may be applied to individual power amplifiers. For example, in this<br>
embodiment, the voltage signal is applied to only the grid electrode of the power amplifier<br>
transistor 741 in the last power amplifier 740. The value of the voltage signal varies for<br>
different power amplifier transistors. For example. If the power amplifier transistors are<br>
N-channel LDMOSs. the voltage signals corresponding to the voltage control signals "1"<br>
(the Busy state) may be 2 V to 5 V. and the voltage signals corresponding to the voltage<br>
control signals "0" (the Idle state) may be 0 V to 2 V. When the power amplifier<br>
