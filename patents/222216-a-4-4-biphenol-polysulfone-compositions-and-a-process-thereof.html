				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a 4,4'-biphenol poysupone compositions and a process thereof<br>
Polysulfones comprising more than 50 mol. % of recurring units formed by reacting 4,4'-biphenol with at least one sulfone monomer (hereafter B°' PSU) are unique members of the sulfone polymer family. Among the B°' PSU, polyphenylsulfones, i.e. polysulfones comprising more than 50 mol. % of recurring units formed by reacting 4,4'-biphenol with at least one 4,4'-dihalodi-phenylsulfone (hereafter PPSU), are of particular interest. Bo1 PSU provide compositions with mechanical properties which are usually not found in compositions based on other polymers in their temperature class. Bo1 PSU compositions usually need to be processed at high temperature for good melt flow behaviour ; in some fabrication configurations, melt temperatures as high as 400-420°C are required.<br>
The problem is that, at such high temperatures, the viscosity of B° PSU itself, and consequently of any usual Bo1 PSU composition, increases very much over time, and this viscosity rise makes it very difficult to manufacture articles of consistently high quality based on said compositions.<br>
In addition, when manufacturing articles from B°' PSU itself or from a usual Bo1 PSU composition, it is generally observed that a char layer builds on the walls of tooling that is being used (e.g. in the die in case of an extrusion process, or in the injection nozzle in the case of an injection moulding process); this undesirable char layer grows rapidly over time, and results in the generation of black specks in the articles being fabricated, thereby downgrading their performance and aesthetics. The charring is also responsible for the generation of scrap in the form of black speck laden extrudate. To remove the char layer from the system, a complete shut down and clean up of the fabrication system is needed, which is costly from the standpoint of down time and lost production.<br>
Attempts have already been made to improve the melt stability of various aromatic polysulfones compositions.<br>
GB 1 398 133 discloses that the incorporation of 0.01 to 4% by weight of a phosphite ester can substantially improve the melt viscosity of some varieties of aromatic polysulfones other than Bo1 PSU.<br>
WO 03/089520, which was filed before but published on or after the priority date of the present application, discloses that organic phosphorus-<br><br>
containing compounds like organic phosphites and phosphonites, commonly referred to as melt stabilising agents, can be advantageously added, together with a colorant and/or an optical brightener, to a PPSU composition, for the purpose of reducing its yellowness and increasing its light transmittance. Amounts of phosphorus-containing compound far below 0.1 wt. % (based on the total weight of the composition) proved sufficient to reach the goal.<br>
Some commercial PPSU grades commercialised by Solvay Advanced Polymers, L.L.C. under the registered name RADEL® R, like Radel® R-5600 NT, consist of virgin PPSU polymer and traces (at most 0.01 wt. %) of organic phosphites and/or phosphonites. Said organic phosphites and/or phosphonites are added during the recovery process of the PPSU from the solvent in which the PPSU is dissolved (just after the polycondensation reaction), in an amount of up to 0.20 wt. % based on the amount of PPSU ; however, more than 95% of them are either decomposed into compounds other than organic phosphites and phosphonites, or are lost during said recovery process.<br>
All the prior art PPSU compositions which include an organic phosphite and/or phosphonite compound, although exhibiting sometimes a slightly improved melt stability with regard to usual PPSU compositions (i.e. Bo1 PSU compositions totally free of phosphite and phosphonite), have still not sufficient melt stability at high temperature, so all the problems and drawbacks met with said usual B°' PSU compositions, such as the charring and the formation of black specks, as above detailed, still occur in an acute way.<br>
It is also prior art to blend PPSU with bisphenol A polysulfone, in particular for lowering the price of the PPSU composition, with a possible drawback on the mechanical properties of the PPSU.<br>
As an illustration thereof, example 3 of US 2002/0017743 discloses a blend of 50 wt. % of Radel® R-5600 NT PPSU, 25 wt. % of Udel® P 1710 NT 15 bisphenol A polysulfone and of 25 wt. % of EMS TR 70 amorphous polyamide (available from EMS-Chemie AG of Switzerland). US 2002/0017743 is silent on a possible impact of bisphenol A polysulfone on the melt stability of the PPSU. More generally, as far as the Applicant knows, no public disclosure deals with the possible impact that a bisphenol A polysulfone could have on the melt stability of the PPSU.<br>
Another illustration thereof is a proprietary blend commercially available from Solvay Advanced Polymers, L.L.C., which consists of 55 wt. % of PPSU and of 45 wt.% of PSU.<br><br>
It is an objective of the present invention to provide a 4,4'-biphenol polysulfone composition which addresses the problems raised by the prior art B°' PSU compositions as above detailed.<br>

This implies notably that, in the process according to the present invention, the amount of the phosphorus-containing compound is preferably above 0.05%, more preferably above 0.09% and still more preferably above 0.12% by weight, based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
Finally, it is another objective of the present invention to provide an article made from a B0' PSU composition which solves the problems raised by the prior art articles made from B°' PSU compositions, while maintaining all their beneficial properties.<br>
With this last end in view, the present invention concerns an article made from the above detailed 4,4'-biphenol polysulfone compositions, or prepared by the above described process to prepare a 4,4'-biphenol polysulfone composition.<br>
The article according to the present invention can be semi-finished or finished. It can be a whole article as such or just an element of a more complex article.<br>
The article according to the present invention can be notably (i) a medical or a dental device component such as a steam sterilizable medical tray container or a steam sterilizable surgical handle, (ii) a steam sterilizable lab animal cage (or one of the related ancillary caging components such as a water bottle), (iii) a food service component such as an institutional food serving tray, (iv) an acid or alkali solution container such as a battery case, (v) a component for plumbing or for hot water delivery system such as a fitting or a manifold, (vi) a plumbing fitting for use in food processing, (vii) an aircraft interior component, (viii) an electrical and/or electronic component such as a connector, a circuit board, a switch, a relay, a housing or a magnet wire insulation coating, (ix) an optoelectronic device component such as a lens, a prism or a wave-guide, (x) a fibre<br><br>
optic connector, (xi) an impact resistant safety device such as a helmet, a hard hat or a bump cap, (xii) a semi-finished or finished extruded shape like a plaque, a sheet, a film, a filament, a profile or a tubing.<br>
The article according to the present invention is preferably chosen from medical and dental device components.<br>
The article according to the present invention can be manufactured by any technique which is known by the skilled person. Non limitative examples of such techniques are injection moulding, thermoforming, blow moulding, extrusion, as well as any combination thereof. It is preferably manufactured by an injection moulding process.<br>
The composition according to the present invention exhibits usually an outstanding melt stability at high temperature, i.e. at such high temperatures, the viscosity of the melt composition remains almost constant over time, which makes it easy to manufacture articles based on said composition.<br>
It has been observed that, in the composition according to the present invention, not only the phosphorous-containing compound but also surprisingly the B°' A PSU act as melt stabilisers of the Bo1 PSU (i.e. both contribute to minimise or prevent viscosity rise at high temperature). Furthermore, in a quite unexpected way for the skilled person, said Bo1 A PSU and said phosphorous-containing compound, act in a synergetic way, resulting in a composition having an outstanding melt stability stability ; this synergetic effect is highlighted when the phosphorus-containing compound is present in an amount of above 0.05 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
In addition to achieving outstanding melt stability, the composition according to the present invention retains usually the key mechanical properties of the B°' PSU ; furthermore, it is in general substantially transparent, which increases its versatility and commercial utility for various uses.<br>
It is usually observed that, when processing a composition according to the present invention, no char layer builds on the walls of tooling that is being used for fabrication (e.g., - in the die in case of an extrusion process or the injection nozzle in the case of an injection moulding process) or, when such char layer builds, its formation takes a huge amount of time. Then, no more or only very spaced-out shut downs and clean up of the installations are required to remove the char layer. Thereby, the productivity is increased and the lost production minimised.<br><br>
The article according to the present invention is usually free (or essentially free) of black specks (since no or very few char forms), and has consequently superior performance or aesthetics or both.<br>

Preparation of the compositions. All of them were prepared by melt compounding in a 25 mm Berstorff co-rotating partially intermeshing twin-screw extruder.<br>
Except for CE1, 10 kg mixes were prepared by tumbling the phosphorus-containing compound (in powder form) and/or the B°' A PSU (in the form of pellets), with the B°' PSU (also in the form of pellets), in sealed 5-gallon plastic buckets for 20 minutes. The B°' PSU grade itself (CE1) or the mixes (El, CE2 and CE3) were then fed to the throat of the extruder which was run at 220 rpm,<br>
and a throughput rate of 11.5 kg/h. The Berstorff machine used consisted of 7 heated barrel sections in addition to the unheated feed throat section. The first heated barrel section was vented to the atmosphere while the sixth heated barrel section was vacuum vented with vacuum levels of 500-650 mm Hg. The heated barrel section temperature settings were: 315/320/350/345/345/340/345°C for heated barrel sections 1 through 7, respectively. The die used was a double-hole die and was set at 345°C. The melt temperature as measured on polymer extrudate was in the range 390-395°C. The strands exiting the extruder were cooled in a water bath and were cut into pellets using a conventional strand cutting pelletizer.<br>
Determination of the VR40 ratio (which quantifies the melt stability of the composition at high temperature). The extrusion compounded pellets to be tested for stability were dried under full vacuum (pressure below 71.12 mm Hg) for at least 3 hours at 150 °C.A Kayeness Galaxy® V capillary rheometer having a bore diameter of 9.55 mm and equipped with a 20.32 mm long x 1.02 mm diameter die was used. The entrance angle of the die was 120 degrees. The rheometer barrel was equilibrated at 410 °C, then filled with pellets. The pellets were allowed to melt for 5 minutes, at which time a timer was started (this time is referred hereafter as t0). A viscosity reading at a shear rate of 50 s"1 was taken from the rheometer at t0+l 0 min. At t0+40 min, another reading is taken at the same shear rate. The viscosities at t0+10 min and at t0+40 min were both recorded and the ratio of the viscosity at t0+40 min to the viscosity to+10 min was calculated ; this ratio is the so-called VR40. In an ideal composition, VR40 should be equal to one.<br>
Determination of mechanical properties. The extrusion compounded pellets were dried overnight for 16 hours in a desiccated air oven at a temperature of 149°C before they were injection moulded into 0.125 in-thick ASTM tensile bars and Izod impact bars. Injection moulding was performed on a 120-Ton Battenfeld reciprocating screw injection moulding machine using barrel temperature settings of 350, 350 and 355°C for the rear, mid and front barrel sections, respectively. The nozzle temperature was set at 360 °C. The melt temperature was 390°C and the mould temperature was 148°C. An injection pressure of 75 bar was used. Screw speed for resin plastication was set at 250 rpm and the moulding cycle time was 35 seconds.<br>
Tensile strength, tensile modulus, tensile yield elongation and tensile elongation at break were measured according to ASTM method D638.<br>
Results on melt viscosity and mechanical properties . El achieved an outstanding melt viscosity stability ratio VR40 at 410 °C of 1.12, approaching the ideal viscosity ratio of 1.00. Thereby, it achieved a roughly four fold improvement in melt stability over CE1, more than a two fold improvement in melt stability over CE3, and not less than a two fold improvement in melt stability over CE2. In addition, El achieved a high level of mechanical properties, very similar to that of compositions CE1, CE 2 and CE3.<br>
Example 1' (according to the invention) and comparative examples I' to 3' - Assessment of the char formation. Compositions El', CE1', CE2' and CE3', having exactly the same chemical nature as respectively compositions El, CE1, CE2 and CE3, were prepared at a larger scale (semi-pilot scale) using a W&amp;P ZSK-40 twin screw extruder, with 12 barrels or temperature zones (Bl to B12). The set point temperatures were respectively : 200°C in Bl (feed zone), 330°C from B2 to B4, 340°C from B5 to B6 and 345°C from B7 to B12. The first heated barrel section was vented to the atmosphere while the other heated barrel section were vacuum vented. The screw speed was 300 rpm. All the compositions were processed in exactly the same conditions.<br>
When comparative example 1' was run in the above extrusion process with melt temperatures approaching 420 °C charring, and pluggage of die tooling with black specks plugging the extrusion nozzle orifice after relatively short run durations were observed. Essentially the same happened when running comparative examples 2' and 3', but after a slightly longer run and with a slightly less intensity. Conversely, when example 1 was run in the same process in the same operating conditions, neither pluggage of die tooling nor black specks plugging the extrusion nozzle orifice were observed even after a long time.<br><br><br>
