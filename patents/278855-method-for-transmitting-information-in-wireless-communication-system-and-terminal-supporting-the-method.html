METHOD FOR TRANSMITTING INFORMATION IN<br>
WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM AND TERMINAL<br>
SUPPORTING THE METHOD<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[1]	This disclosure relates to a wireless (radio) communication system, to a method for<br>
efficiently transmitting information between different terminals, and a wireless com-<br>
munication terminal supporting the method.<br>
[2]	In general, Combination of CS and IMS services (CSI) is a technique for providing a<br>
desired service between two users by combining a Circuit-Switched (CS) service and<br>
an Instant Messaging Service (IMS) service. Here, procedures defined in the existing<br>
specification may be employed for a CS call setup and an IMS session setup.<br>
[3]	In the CSI, CSI UE denotes a terminal capable of supporting both a CS service and a<br>
Packet-Switched (PS) service at the same time. The CSI UE performs communications<br>
through a CS bearer for a voice component, while performing communications through<br>
an IMS bearer via a PS for various IMS services (e.g., messaging, white board, etc.).<br>
[4]	CSI AS is an application server which handles voice sessions of the CSI. When an<br>
INVITE message contains voice related session information, the CSI AS has a function<br>
of transmitting the corresponding session to a specific domain (CS or PS). If the<br>
session contains other types of information in addition to the voice, the CSI AS should<br>
be capable of performing segregation and concatenation for the session.<br>
[5]	Fig. 1 illustrates a basic session setup between CSI UEs.<br>
[6]	Fig. 1 illustrates how a session for a combined session (i.e., voice component + IMS<br>
session) is established on a core network in case where both originating and<br>
terminating terminals are CSI UEs.<br>
[7]	When a CSI UE 1 establishes (sets) a combined session in which a non-real-time<br>
IMS session is combined with voice, message, and the like, a CS call for the voice<br>
component and an IMS session for the non-real-time IMS service are separately<br>
initiated. If a terminating side terminal is also a CSI UE (i.e., CSI UE 2), the CS call<br>
for the voice component is connected to the CS domain (e.g., CS domain 1 and CS<br>
domain 2), while the IMS session is connected to an IMS domain (e.g., IMS domain 1<br>
and IMS domain 2).<br>
[8]	However, in order to simultaneously perform the CS and PS services in the CSI, both<br>
CSI UE and radio coverage should support a MultiRAB/DTM.<br>
[9]	That is, the CSI UE can simultaneously perform the CS and PS services currently<br>
 <br>
provided in the CSI only when the CSI UE is under the coverage of the MultiRAB/<br>
DTM. Therefore, the CSI allows CSI UEs to exchange radio environment capabilities<br>
with each other upon establishing a CS call, thereby checking whether the CS and PS<br>
can simultaneously be performed. Through this call setup process, if it is checked that<br>
each radio environment of the CSI UEs is under the MultiRAB/DTM environment<br>
which simultaneously supports both the CS and PS, the CSI UE can perform a<br>
procedure of initiating a multimedia session.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates a radio environment information exchange procedure between CSI<br>
UEs upon establishing a CS call.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 2, first, a UE A sends a SETUP message including the current<br>
radio environment information encoded in a user-user signaling IE to a CS domain A<br>
of an originating network, thus to initiate a CS call (S1).<br>
After receiving the SETUP message, the CS domain A of the originating network<br>
sends an IAM message including the current radio environment information on the UE<br>
A toward the CS domain B of a terminating network (S2). The CS domain B of the<br>
terminating network then forwards the IAM message to a UE B (S3).<br>
The UE B stores the current radio environment information on the UE A included in<br>
the IAM message, and detects based upon the corresponding radio environment information <br>
whether the UE A is under the coverage of the MultiRAB/DTM<br>
(simultaneously supporting both CS and PS services). Also, the UE B may take the<br>
stored current radio environment information of the UE A in account when deciding<br>
what service options to present to a user and/or whether to initiate a UE capability information <br>
exchange.<br>
If it is detected based upon the current radio environment information on the UE A<br>
that the UE A is under the coverage of the multiRAB/DTM (simultaneously supporting<br>
both CS and PS services), the UE B sends the final response, for example, a<br>
CONNECT message by including its current radio environment information therein,<br>
with respect to the SETUP message (S4).<br>
The CS domain B of the terminating network having received the CONNECT<br>
message sends an ANM or CON message including the current radio environment information <br>
on the UE B toward the CS domain A of the originating network (S5).<br>
The CS domain A of the originating network having received the ANM or CON<br>
message sends the CONNECT message including the current radio environment information <br>
on the UE B to the UE A (S6). Accordingly, the UE A and the UE B can<br>
smoothly perform the IMS session setup procedure.<br>
Thus, upon the communication between the CSI terminals, the radio environments of<br>
the counterpart terminals can be exchanged upon establishing the CS call, thereby<br>
smoothly performing the IMS session setup procedure.<br>
 <br>
However, upon the communication among plural terminals (different types of<br>
terminals), for example, upon the communication between a CSI UE and an IMS UE,<br>
capability (e.g., radio environment) information exchange is not supported. As a result,<br>
a combinational service between the two terminals (i.e., CSI UE and IMS UE) may not<br>
smoothly be performed. That is, the IMS UE may not transmit the current radio environment <br>
information (i.e., capability information) at the session setup procedure. In<br>
this case, the CSI UE may not transmit its radio environment to the IMS UE<br>
(counterpart terminal) because the IMS UE does not perform the capability exchange<br>
procedure.<br>
Therefore, when the IMS UE intends to sequentially provide a voice service and a<br>
multimedia service, the IMS UE can not recognize whether the corresponding services<br>
are supported by the CSI UE. Accordingly, the IMS UE may not attempt to perform an<br>
additional communication with the CSI UE or may request an unnecessary service<br>
from the CSI UE.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates a process of establishing call and session between different types of<br>
terminals.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 3, for voice and non-voice media communications with the CSI<br>
UE, the IMS UE sends an INVITE message for establishing a session including the information <br>
related to the voice and non-voice media to an IMS core to which the IMS<br>
UE belongs (S10). A S-CSCF2 of the IMS core forwards the INVITE message to a S-<br>
CSCF1 of the IMS core to which the CSI UE belongs according to an IMS session<br>
setup procedure (S11). Here, the IMS UE indicates a terminal which does not support a<br>
Circuit-Switched (CS) service and performs every service through an IMS domain.<br>
That is, the IMS UE performs communications even with respect to a voice component<br>
through a VoIMS service of the IMS domain.<br>
The S-CSCF1 performs a service logic to authenticate a terminating UE (i.e., CSI<br>
UE) (S12). The S-CSCF1 then routes the INVITE message to a CSI AS with reference<br>
to routing information read from a HSS (not shown) (S13).<br>
The CSI AS performs a session split with respect to the INVITE message (S14). Accordingly,<br>
 the CSI AS sends a voice component to a CS domain of the CSI UE and<br>
sends a non-voice multimedia component to the IMS domain, thereby requesting a CS<br>
call setup or an IMS session setup.<br>
That is, the CSI AS sends the INVITE message including the voice component to a<br>
MGCF/MGW of the IMS core via the S-CSCF1 (S15 and S16). The MGCF/MGW<br>
maps the INVITE message (i.e., a SIP (session initiation protocol) message) to an<br>
ISUPIAM message, thus to forward the ISUPIAM message to a CS MGW (i.e., the<br>
CS domain) of the CSI UE (S17). The CS MGW sends a SETUP message to the CSI<br>
UE to request the CS call setup (S18). Also, the CSI AS sends the INVITE message<br>
 <br>
including the non-voice multimedia component to the CSI UE via the S-CSCF1, to<br>
request the IMS session setup (S19 and S20).<br>
Accordingly, the CSI UE respectively sends response messages to the CSI AS with<br>
respect to the CS call setup and the IMS session setup. The CSI AS receives the<br>
response messages with respect to the requests for the voice component and the non-<br>
voice component from the CSI domain and the IMS domain, respectively, and<br>
thereafter performs a session combine.<br>
That is, the response message (e.g., CONNECT) with respect to the request for the<br>
voice component outputted from the CSI UE is converted into an ISUP CON message<br>
at the CS MGW so as to be sent to the MGCF/MGW (S21 and S22). A 200 OK<br>
converted from the ISUP CON message at the MGCF/MGW is inputted to the CSI AS<br>
via the S-CSCF1 (S23 and S24). In addition, the response message (e.g., 200 OK) with<br>
respect to the request for the non-voice multimedia component outputted from the CSI<br>
UE is directly inputted to the CSI AS via the S-CSCF1 (S25 and S26).<br>
Therefore, the CSI AS receives the response messages with respect to the voice<br>
component and non-voice multimedia component, thus to perform the session combine<br>
(S27). The CSI AS then forwards the response message (e.g., 200 OK) for the<br>
combined session is sent to the IMS UE, namely, the originating UE, via the S-CSCF1<br>
and S-CSCF2 (S28 ~S30).<br>
Afterwards, the CSI UE and the IMS UE generate (establish) bearers for an actual<br>
data transmission based upon a session negotiation. However, if the CSI UE (i.e., the<br>
terminating terminal) is not under the coverage of the MultiRAB/DTM, even if the<br>
response message outputted from the CSI UE includes permissions for all media<br>
included in the session, the CS bearer may only be established, or the IMS bearer may<br>
only be generated via the PS.<br>
As such, upon the communications between different types of terminals, since a radio<br>
environment information exchange is not supported, the combined service may not<br>
smoothly be performed between two different terminals. As a result, when the IMS UE<br>
wants to provide a multimedia service after providing a voce service, it can not know<br>
whether the CSI UE supports the corresponding multimedia service, the IMS UE can<br>
not perform an additional communication, or request an unnecessary service from the<br>
CSIUE.<br>
That is, from the perspective of the IMS UE, when VoIP is set, no information is<br>
provided as to whether its counterpart terminal is a CS UE, a CSI UE or an IMS UE,<br>
the IMS UE may not easily attempt to perform an additional communication. Even if<br>
the communication is additionally attempted toward the counterpart terminal, the<br>
attempt may be made without exact radio environment information related to the<br>
counterpart terminal, thereby increasing probability of communication failure much<br>
 <br>
more.<br>
Furthermore, from the perspective of the CSIUE, when the VoIP is opened, communications<br>
 toward the CS domain are performed by a PSTN interworking. Accordingly,<br>
a voice service may only be used without any information as to whether the<br>
counterpart UE is a CS UE or an IMS UE. If the counterpart UE is either a CSI UE or<br>
an IMS UE, the CSI UE can additionally use a multimedia service while using the<br>
voice service. In spite of that, however, the CSI UE may not attempt to perform any<br>
communication for any service due to the lack of information on an exact radio environment <br>
of the counterpart UE.<br>
Therefore, this disclosure is to provide a method for transmitting information in a<br>
wireless communication system capable of increasing satisfaction of multimedia communications <br>
by allowing a radio environment information exchange between a CSI<br>
terminal and an IMS terminal, and a wireless communication terminal supporting the<br>
method.<br>
This disclosure is also to provide a method for transmitting information in a wireless<br>
communication system capable of supporting an efficient communication by additionally <br>
providing information on usable services after setting an initial communication <br>
among multiple terminals.<br>
In this disclosure, there is provided a method for transmitting information in a<br>

Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of this disclosure will be explained in detail as<br>
follows.<br>
In general, different types of terminals (e.g., CS UE, CSI UE and IMS UE) have<br>
different communication environments. Supportable services may depend on various<br>
environments, or constraints on communications may be generated according to the<br>
various environments.<br>
For example, a CSI UE simultaneously supports Circuit-Switched (CS) service and<br>
Packet-Switched (PS) service only under the coverage of a MultiRAB/DTM. The IMS<br>
UE can establish and control several sessions and bearers under a packet-based environment,<br>
 but may use different services based upon a user's service registration. In<br>
addition, supportable services may be varied according to radio interfaces supporting<br>
communications and construction of a core network. Types of usable services may be<br>
restricted according to with whom the communication is performed.<br>
Recently, when a communication is connected between end terminals (e.g., an<br>
originating terminal and a terminating terminal), information related to the connected<br>
communication can only be known. However, besides the information of the connected<br>
communication, such additional information as information related to a radio environment <br>
which the terminating terminal expose to, information with respect to which<br>
terminal the terminating terminal is now communicating with, and the like, are not<br>
exchanged between the terminals for the communication. Accordingly, which services<br>
 <br>
can additionally be used may not be recognized.<br>
Therefore, this disclosure proposes a method for allowing a combined service to be<br>
smoothly performed by exchanging information between two terminals after an initial<br>
communication (e.g., voice communication or multimedia communication) is<br>
connected among various or different types of terminals. That is, this disclosure<br>
proposes a method for exchanging information between CSI UE and IMS UE, in order<br>
to support communications for one or more components (e.g., voice component or<br>
non-voice multimedia component) between the CSI UE and the IMS UE.<br>
Here, information exchanged between the two terminals (i.e., CSI UE and IMS UE)<br>
may be described as follows.<br>
-	IMS registration information<br>
-	Radio environment information such as MultiRAB/DTM<br>
-	Information on available services<br>
-	CS Registration information<br>
-	User preference service information<br>
-	Information related to other useable services<br>
These information can be exchanged by the following signaling after an initial communication <br>
is set.<br>
-	CS signaling<br>
-	PS signaling (including IMS)<br>
-	Mutual mapping signaling in case of CS/PS interworking<br>
Therefore, in this disclosure, the aforementioned information can be provided<br>
according to various network environments or according to counterpart UEs as<br>
follows.<br>
1.	Communication between IMS UE and CS UE<br>
-	Multimedia capability supportable by CS UE<br>
-	Radio environment information on CS UE<br>
-	Capability information such as MultiRAB/DTM supportable CS UE<br>
-	Registration status information on IMS UE<br>
-	Useable service list of IMS UE<br>
-	IMS UE capability information<br>
-	IMS UE capability version information<br>
2.	Communication between IMS UE and CSI UE<br>
-	Registration status information on IMS UE<br>
-	useable service list of IMS UE<br>
-	IMS UE capability information<br>
-	IMS UE capability version information<br>
-	IMS UE notification information<br>
 <br>
-	CSIUE capability version information<br>
-	Radio environment information on CSI UE<br>
-	IMS registration status information on CSI UE<br>
-	CSI UE capability information<br>
-	Useable service list of CSI UE<br>
-	CSI capable notification<br>
-	CS status information on CSI UE<br>
3. Communication between IMS UE and IMS UE<br>
-	Useable IMS service information<br>
-	Preference service information on counterpart UE<br>
-	Capability version information<br>
Here, CSI AS, MGCF and the like may exist between the IMS UE and the CSI UE to<br>
thus allow a smooth communication between the IMS UE and the CSI UE. In addition,<br>
upon the interworking between the signaling in an IMS domain (i.e., SIP) and the<br>
signaling in a CS domain (i.e., ISUP), the aforementioned information may be included<br>
and exchanged. Therefore, a contents for a related header or body should be added to<br>
the IMS regarding the aforementioned information. Also, a parameter of an ISUP<br>
message which can be mapped to the SIP should be newly defined or an existing<br>
parameter thereof should be able to be used. When using this method, an IMS registration <br>
state of a counterpart UE, current radio environment and capability, a<br>
supportable capability and capability version and other available services can be<br>
recognized based upon information exchanged in a state of VoIP or typical multimedia<br>
being set.<br>
That is, upon a VoIP connection, a communication on the CS domain may be<br>
performed by a PSTN interworking. Accordingly, the CSI UE can only use a simple<br>
voice service without any information as to whether another UE is a CS UE or an IMS<br>
UE. If the counterpart UE is either a CSI UE or an IMS UE, the CSI UE can additionally<br>
 use a multimedia service while using the voice service. In spite of that,<br>
however, the CSI UE may not even attempt to perform any communication for any<br>
service due to the lack of such information. Also, since the IMS UE can not recognize<br>
whether its counterpart UE is CSI UE, CS UE or IMS UE, the IMS UE may not<br>
perform an additional communication. Even if any communication is additionally<br>
attempted, the attempt may be made without exact radio environment information<br>
related to the counterpart UE, resulting in a much more increase in probability of communication <br>
failure.<br>
Therefore, this disclosure may allow in a communication between an IMS UE and a<br>
CSI UE that they can exchange and use various useable information upon their initial<br>
communication by adding an interworking function and a mapping function.<br>
 <br>
Methods for transmitting multimedia information in a wireless communication<br>
system according to the present invention may be classified according to upon setting<br>
(establishing) an IMS service session and upon setting a CS call.<br>
First, a method for transmitting information in a wireless communication system<br>
upon setting an IMS service session may denote a method in which when an IMS UE<br>
sends a session setup INVITE message, a CSI AS may recognize information related to<br>
a CSI UE to inform to the IMS UE, which is performed by the following two schemes.<br>
According to a first scheme, the CSI AS may recognize radio environment information <br>
related to the CSI UE by converting a SIP message into an ISUP message,<br>
and thereafter may inform the IMS UE of the recognized radio environment information <br>
on the CSI UE. The radio environment information may be included in a<br>
header or body of a SIP message which is sent from the CSI AS to PS and CS domains<br>
of the CSI UE.<br>
In the first scheme, the CSI AS converts (maps, changes, etc.) a SIP request received<br>
from the IMS UE and then includes radio environment information related to SIP<br>
capability in the converted SIP request. The CSI AS may forward the information<br>
included SIP request to the CSI UE. Here, the SIP request (message) may be sent by<br>
being converted into an ISUP message used in a PSTN (or vice-versa).<br>
If the radio environment information is included in the ISUP message, the CSI UE<br>
may include its radio environment information in the ISUP message for response. The<br>
ISUP message may be re-converted into the SIP response message by a SIP-ISUP<br>
mapping, to be sent to the CSI AS. Therefore, the CSI AS may analyze the received<br>
SIP response message, and then may send the IMS UE the radio environment information <br>
related to the CSI UE in a manner of sending a warning message, or the like.<br>
According to a second scheme, the CSI AS may recognize radio environment information <br>
related to the CSI UE by exchanging OPTIONS between the CSI AS and the<br>
CSI UE, so as to inform the IMS UE of the recognized radio environment information<br>
on the CSI UE.<br>
In the second scheme, the CSI AS may send a separate OPTIONS request to the CSI<br>
UE in order to recognize the radio environment information related to the CSI UE. The<br>
CSI UE may forward its capability and radio environment information to the CSI AS<br>
in response to the OPTIONS request. The CSI AS then may analyze the response<br>
message received from the CSI UE, to thereby forward the radio environment information <br>
related to the CSI UE to the IMS UE in the manner of using a warning<br>
message, or the like.<br>
A method for transmitting information in a wireless communication system upon<br>
setting a CS call may be a method in which a CSI UE includes its own information in a<br>
SETUP message or an INVITE message to inform to an IMS UE.<br>
 <br>
Preferably, the SETUP message may be sent when the CSIUE has set a voice communication <br>
at the beginning, while the INVITE message (or OPTIONS message) may<br>
be sent when the CSI UE has set a multimedia communication at the beginning.<br>
Preferably, the sent information may include CSI UE related radio environment information <br>
(e.g., MultiRAB/DTM cell, GPRS network, UTRAN network, etc.), CSI UE<br>
related capability information (e.g., information as to whether only GPRS can support,<br>
only CS can support, DTM can support, or MultiRAB/DTM can support), CSI UE<br>
related IMS registration information, available service list of CSI UE (e.g., PoC, a<br>
service list of video calls, etc.), CSI capable notification (i.e., information as to<br>
whether a current terminal may be a CSI capable terminal), capability version information, <br>
and the like.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates a first embodiment of a method for transmitting multimedia information <br>
in a wireless communication system according to the present invention,<br>
which illustrates a method for recognizing a radio environment of a CSI UE by<br>
converting (mapping, changing, etc.) a SIP message into an ISUP message when<br>
setting an IMS service session.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 4, an IMS UE may send an INVITE message to a S-CSCF2 of<br>
an IMS core to which the IMS UE belongs, thereby requesting a session setup for<br>
connecting a SIP-based voice service with a CSI UE (i.e., terminating UE) (S40). The<br>
S-CSCF2 may forward the INVITE message to a S-CSCF1 of the IMS core to which<br>
the CSI UE belongs according to an IMS session setup procedure (S41).<br>
After receiving the INVITE message, the S-CSCF1 may perform a service logic to<br>
authenticate the CSI UE (i.e., the terminating UE) (S42), and then may forward the<br>
INVITE message to the CSI AS with reference to routing information read from a HSS<br>
(not shown) (S43).<br>
The CSI AS having received the INVITE message either may split or forward a<br>
session according to a media type included in the INVITE message. For example, if the<br>
INVITE message includes a voice component and a non-voice multimedia component,<br>
the CSI AS may perform a session split such that the CSI AS sends the voice<br>
component to a CS domain of the CSI UE and sends the non-voice multimedia<br>
component to an IMS domain.<br>
On the other hand, if the INVITE message includes any one of the voice component<br>
and the non-voice multimedia component, the CSI AS may send the voice component<br>
to the CS domain of the CSI UE or may send the non-voice multimedia component to<br>
the IMS domain. Here, the CSI AS may add a radio environment related header to the<br>
INVITE message (i.e., a SIP message) and may send the header-added message to the<br>
CS and/or IMS domain(s). This is because a radio environment field should be<br>
included in a request message in order for the CSI UE to add its radio environment in-<br>
 <br>
formation to a response message. Fig. 4 illustrates an example in which the INVITE<br>
message only includes the voice component. Accordingly, the CSI AS may determine<br>
that the radio environment related header is added to the INVITE message including<br>
the voice component, to be then sent to the CS domain of the CSI UE.<br>
The CSI UE can simultaneously perform CS and PS services under the coverage of a<br>
MultiRAB/DTM. Accordingly, in order to perform communication for additional<br>
multimedia data, the CSI UE should be under the coverage of the MultiRAB/DTM,<br>
and such environment-related information should be forwarded to the IMS UE.<br>
However, the CSI UE may forward its radio environment via a UUS of a CS SETUP<br>
signaling when a received SETUP message includes the corresponding radio environment <br>
information.<br>
Accordingly, in one embodiment, for receiving the radio environment information<br>
from the CSI UE, the CSI AS may add the radio environment header to the INVITE<br>
message, and then may send the header added INVITE message to the CS domain. The<br>
following [Table 1] shows an exemplary INVITE message to be forwarded to the CS<br>
domain by the CSI AS.<br>

For example, the radio environment header indicates capability of the IMS UE, and<br>
may be set to CUV-001 or CUV-000. The CUV-001 may indicate that the CSI UE is<br>
under the coverage of the MultiRAB/DTM (i.e., simultaneously supporting PS and<br>
CS), and the CUV-000 may indicate that the CSI UE is not under the coverage of the<br>
MultiRAB/DTM (i.e., optionally supporting PS or CS).<br>
The INVITE message sent by the CSI AS may be forwarded to a MGCF via a S-<br>
CSCF1 in order to be changed (converted) into a protocol of the CS domain (S45 and<br>
S46). The MGCF may map the received INVITE message (i.e., SIP message) into an<br>
ISUP1AM message of the CS domain (S47). During this process, each header of the<br>
INVITE message is changed (converted) into a parameter of the ISUP IAM message.<br>
The following [Table 2] may show an example of the mapping between the INVITE<br>
message and the ISUP IAM message.<br>
Table 2<br>
 <br>
 <br>
In another embodiment, the CSI AS may include UUS signaling information in a SIP<br>
body within the INVITE message. The CSI AS also may include indication in-<br>
formation, which indicates the inclusion of the UUS signaling information in the SIP<br>
body, into a SIP header. The CSI AS accordingly may send the INVITE message<br>
including the UUS signaling information and the indication information to a MGCF/<br>
MGW. The MGCF/MGW may convert the received INVITE message into an ISUP<br>
message. Here, the UUS signaling information included in the INVITE message may<br>
be sent by being included in the ISUP message.<br>
The MGCF may send the converted ISUP IAM message to a CS MGW (S48). The<br>
CS MGW then may convert the ISUP IAM message into a SETUP message to send to<br>
the CSI UE (S49).<br>
Accordingly, the CSI UE may check whether the received SETUP message includes<br>
a radio environment capability. If the SETUP message includes the radio environment<br>
capability according to the checked result, the CSI UE may include its current radio<br>
environment information in a response message (i.e., a CONNECT message) to send to<br>
the CS MGW (S50). Here, in the UUS signaling, since contents for the radio en-<br>
vironment is included in the SETUP message, the CSI UE may include its radio en-<br>
vironment information in the CONNECT message to send to the CS MGW.<br>
The CS MGW may convert the received CONNECT message into the ISUP CON<br>
message to sent to a MGCF of the IMS core (S51). The MGCF then may convert the<br>
ISUP CON message into a SIP message (S52). The MGCF may send a 200 OK<br>
response message with respect to a voice service to the S-CSCF1 (S53). Here, if the<br>
ISUP CON message includes radio environment information, the MGCF may map the<br>
corresponding information to be suitable for formats defined in [Table 1] and [Table 2]<br>
The S-CSCF1 may forward the received 200 OK response message with respect to<br>
the voice service to the CSI AS (S54). The CSI AS may analyze the received 200 OK<br>
 <br>
response message to recognize whether the radio environment of the CSIUE is a<br>
MultiRAB/DTM environment, thereby informing the IMS UE of the recognized information. <br>
For example, if the radio environment of the CSI UE is not the MultiRAB/<br>
DTM environment, the CSI AS may modify the 200 OK response message using a<br>
warning message or other appropriate response message code. If the warning message<br>
is used, the CSI AS may inform the IMS UE using the warning message that the CSI<br>
UE can not simultaneously perform one or more services because it is not under the<br>
MultiRAB/DTM environment.<br>
The CSI AS may send the 200 OK response message to the S-CSCF1, with including<br>
the warning message or without including the warning message, according to the radio<br>
environment of the CSI UE (S56). The S-CSCF1 may forward the 200 OK response<br>
message to the S-CSCF2 according to the existing IMS procedure. The S-CSCF2 accordingly<br>
 may forward the received 200 OK response message to the IMS UE (S57<br>
and S58).<br>
Therefore, if the 200 OK response message does not have the warning message, the<br>
IMS UE may consider it as the CSI UE is under the MultiRAB/DTM environment, and<br>
accordingly may additionally perform a procedure for initiating a multimedia session<br>
(i.e. a process of adding a non-voice multimedia component) (S59 and S60). If the 200<br>
OK response message has the warning message, on the other hand, the IMS UE does<br>
not additionally perform the procedure for initiating the multimedia session under a<br>
state of the voice service being connected.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates a second embodiment of a method for transmitting multimedia information <br>
in a wireless communication system according to the present invention,<br>
which illustrates a method for recognizing a radio environment of a CSI UE via<br>
OPTIONS messages upon setting an IMS service session.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 5, an IMS UE may send an INVITE message to a S-CSCF2 of<br>
an IMS core to which the IMS UE belongs, thereby requesting a session setup for<br>
connecting a SJTP-based voice service with a CSI UE (i.e., terminating UE) (S70). The<br>
S-CSCF2 may forward the INVITE message to a S-CSCF1 of the IMS core to which<br>
the CSI UE belongs according to an IMS session setup procedure (S71).<br>
After receiving the INVITE message, the S-CSCF1 may perform a service logic to<br>
authenticate the CSI UE (i.e., the terminating UE) (S72), and then may forward the<br>
INVITE message to the CSI AS with reference to routing information read from a HSS<br>
(not shown) (S73).<br>
After receiving the INVITE message, the CSI AS may forward the corresonding<br>
INVITE message to a CS domain (S74 ~ S76), and simultaneously may send an<br>
OPTIONS request to an IMS domain of the CSI UE, thereby receiving CSI UE<br>
capability (S77).<br>
 <br>
That is, the CSI AS may forward the INVITE message to the MGCF via the S-<br>
CSCF1, and then may send an OPTIONS request message to the S-CSCF1 so as to<br>
receive the current capability of the CSI UE as shown in the following [Table 3].<br>

The S-CSCF1 may forward the received OPTIONS request to the CSI UE (S78). The<br>
CSI UE then may send to the S-CSC1 a response message (i.e., 200 OK message) with<br>
its capability (i.e., radio environment information) with respect to the OPTIONS<br>
request (S79). Here, the CSI UE may set its radio environment information to REI-01<br>
or REI-00. The REI-01 may indicate that the CSI UE is under the coverage of the<br>
MultiRAB/DTM (i.e., simultaneously supporting PS and CS), while the REI-00<br>
indicates that the CSI UE is not under the coverage of the MultiRAB/DTM (i.e.<br>
optionally supporting PS or CS). Also, the information may be forwarded by being<br>

The S-CSCF1 may forward the received 200 OK message to the CSI AS (S80). Here,<br>
the CSI AS is currently waiting for the response with respect to an actually requested<br>
session. If the response with respect to the actually requested session arrives, the CSI<br>
AS may configure radio environment information related to the CSI UE and a 200 OK<br>
with respect to the actually requested session.<br>
That is, the MGCF may convert the INVITE message received from the S-CSCF1<br>
into an ISUP LAM message of the CS domain (S81). During this process, each header<br>
of the INVITE message may be changed (converts) into a parameter of the ISUP IAM<br>
message as shown in [Table 1]. The ISUP IAM message converted by the MGCF may<br>
be sent to the CS MGW (S82). The CS MGW then may convert the ISUP IAM<br>
message into a SETUP message, to send to the CSI UE (S83).<br>
The CSI UE may send a CONNECT message to the CS MGW in response to the<br>
received SETUP message (S84). The CS MGW may convert the received CONNECT<br>
message into an ISUP CON message, thereby sending the converted ISUP CON<br>
 <br>
message to the MGCF of the IMS core (S85). The MGCF may recognize whether the<br>
CON message includes radio environment related parameter. If the CON message<br>
includes the radio environment related parameter, the MGCF may map the corresponding <br>
information into a header when converting the CON message into a SIP-<br>
based response message. Accordingly, the MGCF may map the received ISUP CON<br>
message into a SIP message (S86), and then sends a 200 OK response message to the<br>
S-CSCF1 with respect to a voice service (S87). The S-CSF1 then may forward the<br>
received 200 OK response message with respect to the voice service to the CSI AS<br>
(S88).<br>
Accordingly, the CSI AS may analyze both the 200 OK response message and the<br>
previously received 200 OK response message with respect to the OPTIONS request.<br>
The CSI AS then may recognize whether the radio environment of the CSI UE is the<br>
MultiRAB/DTM environment, thereby informing the IMS UE of the recognition. For<br>
example, if the radio environment of the CSI UE is not the MultiRAB/DTM environment, <br>
the CSI AS may modify the 200 OK message using a warning message or<br>
an appropriate response message code (S89).<br>
If the warning message is used, the CSI AS may inform the IMS UE by using the<br>
warning message that the CSI UE can not simultaneously perform one or more<br>
services because the CSI UE is not under the MultiRAB/DTM environment.<br>
The CSI AS may send the 200 OK response message to the S-CSCF1, with including<br>
the warning message or without including the warning message, according to the radio<br>
environment of the CSI UE (S90). The S-CSCF1 may forward the 200 OK response<br>
message to the S-CSCF2 according to the existing EMS procedure. The S-CSCF2 accordingly <br>
may forward the received 200 OK response message to the IMS UE (S91<br>
and S92).<br>
Therefore, if the 200 OK message does not have the warning message, the IMS UE<br>
may consider it as the CSI UE is under the MultiRAB/DTM environment, and accordingly <br>
may additionally perform a procedure for initiating a multimedia session (i.e.<br>
a process of adding a non-voice multimedia component) (S93 and S94). If the 200 OK<br>
response message has the warning message, on the other hand, the IMS UE may not<br>
additionally perform the procedure for initiating the multimedia session under a state<br>
of the voice service being connected.<br>
The method for exchanging radio environment information between the CSI AS and<br>
the CSI UE for a call request (i.e., INVITE message) with the CSI UE requested by the<br>
EMS UE may have been explained with reference to Figs. 4 and 5 of the present<br>
invention. However, another embodiment of proceeding a call request with an IMS UE<br>
according to a request by a CSI UE may be applicable. Here, the functions of the CSI<br>
AS and the MGCF MGW are the same in both Figs. 4 and 5, namely, the function of<br>
 <br>
the CSI AS for exchanging radio environment information and the function of the<br>
MGCF/MGW are the same in Fig. 4 and 5. Accordingly, the detailed description<br>
thereof will be omitted.<br>
As described above, this disclosure can effectively increase satisfaction of<br>
multimedia communications and support efficient communications, by forwarding<br>
radio environment information related to a CSI terminal to an IMS terminal and simul-<br>
taneously providing information on further usable terminals between the two terminals.<br>
This disclosure has been explained with reference to the embodiments which are<br>
merely exemplary. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modi-<br>
fications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from<br>
the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that this disclosure cover modi-<br>
fications and variations of this disclosure provided they come within the scope of the<br>
