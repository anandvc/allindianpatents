				<td>Field of the Invention <br>
The present invention relates to a process for prepartion fo a hard palm oil<br>
The prrelates to a Trans free hard structural fat suitable for the manufacture of low SAFA (Saturated Fatty Acid) poly/mono unsaturated margarine and spreads and fat blends for margarine/spreads and a process for preparing the same.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Historically emulsified fat system in margarine/spreads has been designed to satisfy customer requirements. Some of the prominent features are significant cooling impact, a rapid sharp melt sensation, and no coated or waxy feel on the tongue. In addition, it should impart temperature cycling stability (heat stability) as well as spreadability<br>
when taken out frequently from the refrigerators. <br>
To achieve these objectives, margarine fat blend is being formulated using hard stocks derived by hydrogenation of liquid oils.<br>
However, with the adverse effect of Trans fatty acids being published, consumers are        <br>
 looking for margarine / spreads with practically no Trans fatty acids.<br>
This can be achieved by using fully hydrogenated fats as structural fat, which usually does not contain Trans fatty acid or very negligible amount.<br>
Hydrogenation process is generally viewed as the main reason for the development of Trans fatty acids in oils and fats. Hence, there is a strong consumer perception against usage of hydrogenated oil/fat in the food products including margarine / spreads.<br>
Hence research work is being carried out for developing margarine/spreads using no 30     hydrogenated oils in their hard stock at the same time looking at the possibility of reducing the saturated fatty acid levels (SAFA) in the products.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a margarine /spread having      reduced saturated fatty acid levels (SAFA)<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide process for the preparation of margarine/spreads using non-hydrogenated oils in their hard stock.<br><br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of margarine /spreads having reduced saturated fatty acid levels (SAFA).<br>

The invention is further described in the following examples which are given by way of illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention in any manner.<br>
Example 1; Theoretical Considerations<br>
The hard stock contributes triglycerides especially of the trisaturated type. A certain minimum quantity of these is essential to provide the "structural fat" and to prevent oiling out of the liquid oil. From the patent literature and general experience, this minimum quantity is around 6%. More is acceptable and desirable if the amount of H3 tri-glycerides, and especially tristearin, is not greater than 2% otherwise poor mouth feel will result. Hence content of H2M triglycerides is valuable, to give the structuring<br><br>
effect, hence the need for a lauric oil.<br>
When the hard stock components are interesterified, the amounts of trisaturated triglycerides in the interesterified product are determined entirely by the content of saturated fatty acids in the blend. This relationship is very critical as shown by the results:<br>
% Saturated FA	% Trisaturated Triglycerides<br>
in the Oil blend	After Interesterification<br>
50	13<br>
60	22<br>
70	34<br>
80	51<br>
90	73<br>
Taking sunflower oil as the PUFA oil to be used in the blend, at a level of 80% (SAFA 10.3%) then the hard stock should not contribute more than 11.76% SAFA to the final blend considering that the SAFA content of polyunsaturated margarine should not exceed 20%. If 20% of the hard stock were used for the margarine blend along with Sunflower oil as above (a high usage level) - and if we also want a minimum of 6% trisaturated Tgs in the final blend, it can be seen from the above table that the SAFA content of the hard stock must be about 67% so that interesterified hard stock has 30% trisaturated triglyceride. Assuming only 15% hard stock is used then the SAFA content of the hard stock must be about 74%, so that it has 40% trisaturated triglyceride after interesterification. These are minimum requirements and a higher amount of trisaturated Tgs would be desirable.<br>
The usage of hard structural fat in the blend can be 5 to 25% and the liquid oil or its blends can be 95 - 75%.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
