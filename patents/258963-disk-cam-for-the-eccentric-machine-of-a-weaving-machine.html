Disk Cam for the Eccentric Machine of a Weaving Machine<br>
The invention relates to a disk cam for an eccentric machine, as well as to such an<br>
eccentric machine.<br>
In most cases, several heald shafts, each comprising many parallel-arranged healds<br>
having thread eyes through which the warp threads are passed, are used for shed formation on<br>
weaving machines. For shed formation, the heald shafts are rapidly moved up and down. To<br>
achieve this, shaft drives that are referred to as shaft machines or eccentric machines are<br>
used. In so doing, eccentric machines use the rotary motion of a drive shaft in order to<br>
generate an oscillating back-and-forth movement, from which the up-and-down movement of<br>
the heald shafts is derived. Thus, high weaving speeds can be achieved.<br>
During the up-and-down movement of the heald shafts high dynamic loads are<br>
generated on the heald shafts, its parts, the shaft machine and the connecting rod assembly<br>
between heald shaft and shaft machine.<br>
-1-<br><br>
Document DE 103 43 377 discloses a shaft machine that allows individual shaft<br>
drives to be added or removed. This is achieved by means of a ratchet mechanism. As a result<br>
of this, heald shafts can be selectively held in the upper or lower reversal region while other<br>
shafts continue to move. In so doing, the design is such that the shafts do not come to a full<br>
movement. As a result of this, a reduction of the accelerating forces acting on the heald shaft<br>
is achieved in the reversal regions. The movement in the reversal regions and the movement<br>
between the reversal regions, in so doing, occurs consistent with different laws of motion.<br>
The transitions between the law of motion in the reversal region and the law of motion<br>
between the reversal regions is such that the first time-derivation of the shaft movement is the<br>
same according to both laws of motion. The different laws of motion are implemented on<br>
different disk cams, whereby, by means of the ratchet mechanism, a switch is performed<br>
from one disk cam to the other. Such shaft machines are relatively complex and expensive.<br>
Various shed formation devices are used for shed formation in weaving mills. These<br>
are so-called shaft machines, eccentric machines and jacquard machines. Neither eccentric<br>
machines nor jacquard machines comprise ratchet mechanism for adding and removing<br>
individual eccentric disks. Considering these machines, however, it is important that weaving<br>
speeds be increased and that stresses be minimized.<br>
Considering this, the object of the invention is to provide a shed formation device or a<br>
component suitable for this shed formation device, said component being used to increase the<br>
operating speed of the weaving machine without excessively stressing the parts of the<br>
weaving machine.<br>
This object is achieved with the disk cam in accordance with Claim 1:<br>
The disk cam in accordance with the invention represents the sought component. Said<br>
component is preferably in permanent driving connection with a continuously moving drive<br>
shaft and is subject to at least two different laws of motion on its cam surface or peripheral<br>
surface. While one law of motion defines the sequence of motions between the upper and the<br>
lower reversal regions of a heald shaft, the other law of motion describes the movement of<br>
the heald shaft in its reversal regions. The laws of motion are selected such that the first and<br>
second time derivations of the two laws of motion coincide. This eliminates shocks and jerks<br>
where transitions of the laws of motions occur. As a result of this, vibrations and wear are<br>
-2-<br><br>
reduced or largely avoided. As a result, the forces and stresses on the shaft drive and on the<br>
heald shaft are reduced. Consequently, an existing shed formation device, e.g., an eccentric<br>
machine, provided said machine is equipped with the inventive disk cams, can be operated at<br>
higher rates of speed, without being damaged and without causing damage to the connecting<br>
rod assemblies, heald shafts, their parts and healds.<br>
A disk cam in accordance with the invention comprises several phases of movement.<br>
The phase of movement (a, a') represents the main phase of movement (sequence of motions<br>
between the upper and lower reversal regions), the phase of movement (b) represents the<br>
upper end phase (upper reversal region), and the phase of movement (c) represents the lower<br>
end phase (lower reversal region). In the phases of movement (b, a, and c), the heald shaft<br>
moves through its stroke region performing a downward movement, in the phases of<br>
movement (c, a', and b), the heald shaft moves through its stroke region performing the<br>
upward movement. The main phase of movement (a, a'), as well as the phases (b and c),<br>
represent phases of movement in which the heald shaft moves through at least one part of the<br>
distance that is to be traveled. For example, they can generate an up-and-down movement of<br>
the heald shaft within a reversal region. However, they can just as well generate a movement,<br>
which, as usual, comes to a short-time stop and remains stopped, whereby, in such a case, the<br>
transition between the laws of motion of the phases (b) and (a), or (a) and (c), or (c) and (a'),<br>
or (a') and (b), respectively, occurs while the first and second distance derivations or time<br>
derivations of the laws of motion are the same. This provides a jerk-free and shock-free<br>
transition of the shaft movement from one phase of movement to the next. By varying the<br>
lengths of the phases of movement and by selecting the respective laws of motion, shaft<br>
movements can be generated which stress the heald shafts significantly less and permit<br>
higher weaving machine rotational speeds. In so doing, the main part of the movement of the<br>
phase (a, a') can be optimized, without having to take into consideration the requirements of<br>
the movements during the phases (b) and (c).<br>
Preferably, the phase of movement (a, a') is configured so as to represent the main<br>
phase, in which the heald shaft moves through at least 50% of its stroke. In phases of<br>
movement (b) and (c), i.e., in the reversal regions, the heald shaft completes its stroke and<br>
comes to a stop, or it moves through a waiting reciprocating motion. Different laws of motion<br>
apply in the main phase and in the end phase. The end phases, both representing a reversal<br>
region, may have different lengths of time and also different stroke lengths. The may be set<br>
-3-<br><br>
different from each other, as long as the transitions to the main phase are corresponding in<br>
the first and second derivations of the respective laws of motion.<br>
During operation, a heald shaft performs a movement that is upward and downward.<br>
The aforementioned movement described as a stroke can apply to the downward movement,<br>
as well as to the upward movement, of a heald shaft.<br>
A disk cam in accordance with the invention, said disk cam defining an upward<br>
movement and a downward movement of a heald shaft, consists of at least four phases of<br>
movement, the phases of movement (b), (c), (a) and (a'). Depending on the flat textile<br>
product to be produced, a disk cam in accordance with the invention may comprise several of<br>
the above-described phases of movement. It is also conceivable that the phases of movement<br>
are identical or partially identical.<br>
The disk cam, as in otherwise common shed formation devices, preferably is<br>
associated with a complementary disk cam. The latter has a profile that is complementary to<br>
the disk cam.<br>
Additional details of advantageous embodiments of the invention are obvious from<br>
the drawings, the description or the claims.<br>
The drawings show an exemplary embodiment of the invention. They show in<br>
Figure 1	a schematic view of a heald shaft with an eccentric machine for driving<br>
said heald shaft;<br>

a disk cam; and,<br>

Figure 5	a diagram of the laws of motion of the disk cam in accordance with<br>
Figure 4.<br>
-5-<br><br>
Figure 1 shows a heald shaft 1 that is driven, via a rod assembly 2, by an eccentric<br>
machine 1 so as to move up and down in an oscillating manner. The vertical direction is<br>
indicated as the x-direction by an arrow. The eccentric machine 3 has, on its outlet, a rocker 4<br>
which is connected to the rod assembly 2. The rocker 4 performs a back-and-forth oscillating<br>
movement as indicated by arrow y in Figure 4, said movement being derived from the<br>
rotation of a main shaft 5. This shaft is provided with a drive, for example, an electric motor,<br>
and rotates at an essentially constant rotational speed.<br>
Seated on the main shaft 5 is a disk cam 6, as is depicted in Figure 2. Its center of<br>
rotation 7 is defined by the main shaft 5. Said shaft has a peripheral surface 8 with a radius r<br>
to the center of rotation 7, this being a function of the angle of rotation a. A cam-following<br>
means 9, for example, having the configuration of a roller 10, that is supported by a pivoting<br>
lever 11 abuts against this peripheral surface 8. Said pivoting lever can be pivoted about a<br>
fulcrum 12 (indicated by arrow z in Figure 3), whereby its pivoting motion is transmitted to<br>
the rocker 4 via a not specifically illustrated transmission connection.<br>
The peripheral surface 8 has several sections a, a', b, c, that define different "laws of<br>
motion". In so doing, laws of motion are understood to mean a function r(oc). In addition, the<br>
radii of the laws of motion b and c are located in the regions that do not overlap each other.<br>
For the selection of the laws of motion for the regions a, a', b and c, reference is made to<br>
Figure 3. Figure 3 shows the stroke of the heald shaft (vertical) and the time (horizontal). The<br>
region Bl shows the stroke section in the phase of movement (c) (lower reversal region. The<br>
region B2 shows the stroke section in the phase of movement (b) (upper reversal region). The<br>
region B3 shows the stroke section in the phases of movement (a) and (a') (movement region<br>
between the reversal regions). The stroke regions B] and B2 of the angle sections b and c do<br>
not overlap. They are separated from each other by a region B3 that is associated with the<br>
angular region a or a'.<br>
The regions a, a', b, c represent phases of movement for the cam-following means 9<br>
and thus for the heald shaft 1. The laws of motion are different in these phases of movement,<br>
whereby the transitions between the individual phases of movement b —&gt; a, and a —&gt; c, and c<br>
—» a', and a' —&gt; b are configured such that the derivations of the first and second order of the<br>
adjacent laws of motion that extend into each other are the same. An inventive disk cam in<br>
accordance with Figures 2 and 4 may use any laws of motion as defined by any<br>
-6-<br><br>
mathematically expressible laws of motion, e.g., sine, cosine, polynomials, etc., and sums<br>
thereof. A disc cam may also use laws of motion that cannot be analytically described.<br>
Considering the aforementioned transition conditions, the cam-following means 9 -<br>
referring to an appropriately designed disk cam having sections a, a', b, c - performs a shock-<br>
free and jerk-free sequence of motions. The section a' may represent a main phase of<br>
movement that is inverse to the section a.<br>
While, referring to the aforementioned exemplary embodiment, the phases of<br>
movement b and c provide a movement that comes almost to a stop at the outer ends of the<br>
reversal regions Bi and B2, also other laws of motion may be provided as illustrated by<br>
Figure 5. The corresponding disk cam is shown excessively high in Figure 4. The laws of<br>
motion in the phases of movement b and c are assumed to be harmonic functions, whereby<br>
they need to have neither a constant amplitude nor a constant frequency. In this case, the<br>
heald shaft 1 performs a reciprocating movement in the reversal regions. Referring to Figure<br>
5, this reciprocating movement is shown in the reversal regions b and c. The above-described<br>
conditions in the region of the transitions of the various movement regions also apply to an<br>
exemplary embodiment of a disk cam in accordance with Figure 4. Consequently, transition<br>
regions without jerks and shocks are created.<br>
An eccentric machine comprising disk cams of the above-described type permits an<br>
optimization of the sequence of movements of the heald shaft 1. Said heald shaft's<br>
acceleration and its deceleration can be optimized. Furthermore, said heald shaft's speed can<br>
be maximized in the phases of movement a and a', without excessively stressing the elements<br>
of the heald shaft or the elements of the eccentric machine 3. In so doing, the time intervals<br>
available for weft insertion can be maximized even at high rotational speeds.<br>
An optimized eccentric machine 3 comprises disk cams 6 having a peripheral surface<br>
8 setting different laws of motion in different sectors. The laws of motion are applied to a<br>
main phase of movement a, a' and to end phases b, c, in which the shaft covers, at best, a<br>
smaller distance of its movement. This partial distance preferably accounts for less than 50%<br>
of the total movement or total stroke of the shaft. The laws of motion of the different phases<br>
of movement or sectors of the disk cam 6 are defined in such a manner that the first and<br>
second derivations of the laws of motion of adjacent sectors coincide at the transition points.<br>
