Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds, isomer thereof or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof as vanilloid receptor (Vanilloid Receptor 1 ; VR1 ; TRPV1) antagonist; and a pharmaceutical composition containing the same.<br>
Background Art<br>
As diseases associated with the activity of vanilloid receptor (Nagy et al., 2004, Eur. J. Pharmacol. 500, 351-369) pain such as acute pain, chronic pain, neuropathic pain, post-operative pain, rheumatic arthrodynia, osteoarthritis pain, postherpetic neuralgia, neuralgia, headache, and migraine(Petersen et al., 2000, Pain, 88, pp125-133; Walker et al., 2003, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Then, 304, pp56-62); nerve-related diseases such as neuropathies, HIV-related neuropathy, nerve injury, neurodegeneration, and stroke(Park et al., 1999, Arch. Pharm. Res. 22, pp432-434; Kim et al., 2005, J. Neurosci. 25(3), pp662-671); diabetic neuropathy (Kamei et al., 2001, Euf. J. Pharmacol. 422, pp83-86); fecal urgency; irritable bowel syndrome (Chan et al., 2003, Lancet, 361, pp385-391); inflammatory bowel disease (Yiangou et al., 2001, Lancet, 357, pp1338-1339); disease of digestive organ such as stomach-duodenal ulcer and Crohn's disease (Holzer P, 2004, Eur. J. Pharm. 500, pp231-241; Geppetti et al., 2004, Br. J. Pharmacol., 141, pp1313-1320); disease of respiratory organ such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(Hwang et al., 2002, Curr<br><br>
Opin Pharm pp235-242; Spina et al., 2002, Curr Opin Pharm pp264-272); urinary incontinence (Birder et al., 2002, Nat. Neuroscience, 5, pp856-860); urinary bladder hypersensitiveness (Birder et al., 2001, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 98, pp13396-13401); neurotic/allergic/inflammatory skin disease such as psoriasis, pruritus and prurigo(Southall et al., 2003, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Then, 304, pp217-222); irritation of skin, eye or mucous membrane (Tominaga et al., 1998, Neuron 21 pp531-543); hyperacusis; tinnitus; vestibular hypersensitiveness (Balaban et al., 2003, Hear Res. 175, pp165-70); cardiac disease such as inotropic ischemia etc.(Scotland et al., 2004, Circ. Res. 95, pp1027-1034; Pan et al., 2004, Circulation, 110, pp1826-1831) can be enumerated.<br>
The vanilloid receptor (VR1) is the receptor for capsaicin (8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide), a pungent ingredient in hot peppers. The molecular cloning thereof was also reported in 1997 (Caterina et al., 1997, Nature 389, pp816-824). This receptor is a non-selective cation channel composed of 6 transmembrane domains and belongs to the TRP channel family. Recently, it was named TRPV1. On the other hand, it is known that the vanilloid receptor is activated by stimuli such as capsaicin, resiniferatoxin, heat, acids, anandamide, lipid metabolites or the like; thus it plays a crucial role as a molecular integrator of physico-chemically noxious stimuli in mammals (Tominaga et al., 1998, Neuron 21 pp531-543; Hwang et al., 2000, PNAS, 97, pp6155-6160). Activation of the vanilloid receptor by endogenous/exogenous stimuli leads to not only transmission of noxious stimuli, but also liberation of neuropeptides such as substance P, CGRP (Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide) and the like, thereby causing neurogenic inflammation. The vanilloid receptor is highly expressed in primary afferent<br><br>
sensory neurons. It is also reportedly expressed in various organs and tissues such as the bladder, kidney, lungs, intestines and skin, and in the central nervous system (CNS) including the brain and non-neuronal tissues (Mezey et al., 2000, PNAS, 97, pp3655-3660; Standeret al., 2004, Exp. Dermatol. 13, pp129-139; Cortrightetal., 2001, BBRC, 281, pp1183-1189). In particular, TRPV1 receptor knock-out mice exhibit a normal response to harmful physical stimuli, but show a reduction in pain responses and sensory sensitivity to thermal stimuli by vanilloid, and exhibit little hyperalgesia to thermal stimuli even in an inflammatory state (Caterina et al., 2000, Science 288, pp306-313; Davis et al., 2000, Nature 405, pp183-187; Karai et al., 2004, J. Clin. Invest., 113, pp1344-1352). Lately, an additional role of the vanilloid receptor is also anticipated by presentation of possibility that the vanilloid receptor may be present in the form of a heteromultimer with TRPV3, another TRP channel (Smith et al., 2002, Nature, 418, pp186-190).<br>
As mentioned above, the vanilloid receptor knock-out mice exhibited reduced responses to thermal or noxious stimuli, thus raising the possibility that vanilloid receptor antagonists may be utilized for prevention or treatment of various pain conditions. Recently, this possibility is supported by the report that the well-known vanilloid receptor antagonist, capsazepine also decreases hyperalgesia caused by physical stimuli in models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain (Walker et al., 2003, JPET, 304, pp56-62; Garcia-Martinez et al., 2002, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 99, 2374-2379). In addition, treatment of the primary culture of afferent nerve cells with the vanilloid receptor agonist, capsaicin etc., results in damage to nerve functions and furthermore death of nerve cells. The vanilloid receptor antagonist exerts defense actions against such damage to nerve functions and nerve cell death (Holzer P, 1991, Pharmacological<br><br>
Reviews, 43, pp143-201; Mezey et al., 2000, PNAS, 97, 3655-3660). The vanilloid receptor is expressed in all regions of the gastrointestinal tract, for example, ganglia of tensor, tunica muscularis, mucosa and epithelial cells. In particular, the vanilloid receptor is highly expressed in inflammatory disorders of the colon and ileum.<br>
In addition, activation of the vanilloid receptor stimulates sensory nerves, which in turn causes release of neuropeptides which are known to play a critical role in pathogenesis of bowel disorders. The role of the vanilloid receptor in development of gastrointestinal disorders is well elucidated and documented in recent scientific papers and journals, for example, Holzer P, 2004, Eur. J. Pharm. 500, pp231-241; Geppetti et al., 2004, Br. J. Pharmacol., 141, pp1313-1320. According to such references, it seems that the vanilloid receptor antagonists will be effective for prevention or treatment of gastrointestinal diseases such as gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) and gastroduodenal ulcer (DU). It has been reported that the number of sensory nerves expressing the vanilloid receptor is increased in patients suffering from irritable bowel syndromes and such increased expression of the vanilloid receptor is known to be involved in the development of the disease (Chan et al., 2003, Lancet, 361, pp385-391). Other investigations showed that expression of the vanilloid receptor is significantly increased in patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disorders. Taken together, it appears that the vanilloid receptor antagonist may also be therapeutically effective for such bowel disorders (Yiangou et al., 2001, Lancet, 357, pp1338-1339). The vanilloid receptor-expressing afferent nerves are abundantly distributed in airway rnucosa. Bronchial hypersensitivity is very similar to hyperalgesia, and protons and lipoxygenase products, known as endogenous ligands for the vanilloid receptor, are well known as crucial factors responsible for development of asthma and chronic<br><br>
obstructive pulmonary diseases (Hwang et al., 2002, Curr. Opin. Pharm. pp235-242; Spina et al., 2002, Curr. Opin. Pharm. pp264-272). Further, it has been reported that air-polluting substances, which are a kind of asthma-causing substances, i.e., particulate matter specifically acts on the vanilloid receptor and such action is inhibited by capsazepine, thus suggesting the possible applicability of vanilloid receptor antagonists to respiratory diseases (Veronesi et al., 2001, NeuroToxicology, 22, pp795-810). Urinary bladder hypersensitiveness and urinary incontinence are caused by various central/peripheral nerve disorders or injury, and capsaicin-responsive sensory nerves play an important role in bladder function control and inflammation. In addition, immunoreactivity of the vanilloid receptor was reported in urinary bladder epithelium (urothelium) in rats and it was found that bladder overactivity induced by capsaicin was due to stimulation of vanilloid receptors present in nerve fibers, or various transmitters which are released by vanilloid receptors (Birder et al., 2001, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 98, pp13396-13401). Further, VR1 (TRPV1) -/- mice are anatomically normal, but exhibit non-excretory bladder contractions by low contractile force, as compared to normal mice, thus indicating that the vanilloid receptor affects functions of the bladder (Birder et al., 2002, Nat. Neuroscience, 5, pp856-860). Some of vanilloid agonists are recently under development as therapeutics for treating bladder diseases. Vanilloid receptors are distributed in human epidermal keratinocytes as well as in primary afferent sensory nerves(Denda et al., 2001, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 285, pp1250-1252; Inoue etal., 2002, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 291, pp124-129), and are then involved in transmission of various noxious stimuli and pains such as skin irritation and pruritus, thereby having close correlation with etiology of dermatological diseases and disorders such as skin inflammation, due to neurogenic/non-neurogenic<br><br>
factors. This is supported by the report that the vanilloid receptor antagonist, capsazepine inhibits inflammatory factors in human skin cells (Southall et al., 2003, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Then, 304, pp217-222).<br>
Based on the above-mentioned information, development of various vanilloid receptor antagonists is under way, and some patents and patent applications relating to vanilloid receptor antagonists under development were recently published, in which the above mentioned information is described well (Rami et al., 2004, Drug Discovery Today: Therapeutic Strategies, 1, pp97-104).<br>
As a result of extensive and intensive studies based on the theoretical background discussed above, the present inventors have synthesized novel compounds having antagonistic activity by selective action on a vanilloid receptor and thus completed the present invention. Surprisingly, it has been identified that compounds having a dibenzyl urea, dibenzylamide or dibenzylcinnamoyl structure and carrying a C2-C5 alkenyl or C2-C5 alkynyl as well as an amine-containing substituent on one of their phenyl ring are particularly active modulators of the vanilloid receptor.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide novel compounds useful as a potent antagonist for a vanilloid receptor, isomer thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof; and a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same.<br>

In one preferred aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical<br>
composition for treating a condition selected from pain, inflammatory disease of the joints including inflammatory autoimmune diseases of the joints, urinary bladder hypersensitivity including urinary incontinence, stomach duodenal ulcer, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), neurotic/allergic/inflammatory skin disease, psoriasis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pruritus, or prurigo comprising a compound, an isomer thereof or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof according to anyone of formula (I), (la), (Ib), (Ic) or (Id), as defined further above.<br>
More specific, the inventive compounds can be used in a pharmaceutical composition for treating pain, wherein the pain is -or is associated with- a condition selected from osteoarthritis ("OA"), rheumatoid arthritis ("RA"), Ankylosing Spondylitis ("AS"), diabetic neuropathic pain, post-operative pain, non-inflammatory musculoskeletal pain (including fibromyalgia, myofascial pain syndrome and back pain), migraine and other types of headaches.<br>
If the compounds of the present invention are said to be useful to treat pain associated with osteoarthritis, it shall not be excluded that this also comprises the treatment of other signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis. Besides reducing the pain associated with osteoarthritis, the pharmacological intervention of osteoarthritis may be aimed at maintaining the mobility and minimizing the disability of the joints.<br>
The term "inflammatory disease of the joints" includes diseases that involve to a more or less degree inflammatory processes in the joints, e.g. in knees, fingers, hips<br>
etc. An example for such a disease is osteoarthritis. The term "inflammatory disease of the joints" does also include diseases or conditions which may involve autoimmune processes, such as e.g. rheumatoid arthrtitis or ankylosing spondylitis. The inventive treatment of "inflammatory diseases of the joints" is primarily aimed at treating pain associated with these conditions but may also aim at improving the function of the affected joints, either directly or indirectly, e.g. by reducing the pain associated with the movement of said joints.<br>
One outcome of the administration of the compounds of the present invention to patients suffering from an inflammatory disease of the joints may thus be reducing the pain experienced by the subject suffering from said disease relative to the pain experienced by the subject immediately before the administration of the compounds or combinations of the present invention. Another outcome of said treatment may be preventing the re-occurence of pain which has previously been reduced as a result of pharmaco- or other therapy. Another outcome of treatment may be decreasing the occurrence of and/or the severity of manifestations related to an inflammatory disease of the joints, including particularly osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis ankylosing spondylitis. The treatment may suitably result in an improved functionality of the joints, such as decreased stiffness, improved mobility.<br>
The term "osteoarthritis (OA)" as used herein typically includes diseases with a failure of a diarthrodial (movable, synovial-lined) joint. In idiopathic (primary) OA, the most common form of the disease, no predisposing factor is apparent. Secondary OA is attributable to an underlying cause. Pain and joint dysfunction are the cardinal<br>
symptoms of OA. The joint pain of OA is often described as a deep ache and is localized to the involved joint. Typically, the pain of OA is aggravated by joint use and relieved by rest, but, as the disease progresses, it may become persistent. Nocturnal pain, interfering with sleep, is seen particularly in advance OA of the hip and may be enervating. Stiffness of the involved joint on arising in the morning or after a period of inactivity may be prominent but usually lasts less than 20 minutes.<br>
The term "RA" refers to Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that causes the immune system to attack the joints, and particularly the synovium in the joint. The synovium becomes inflamed and causes swelling and pain. Cardinal symptoms of RA are joint pain and stiffness but additional symptoms include muscle aches, anemia and fever. Diagnosis of RA can be confirmed by detecting an antibody in the blood called the "rheumatic (or "rheumatoid") factor" and/or by a blood sedimentation test. Other useful and common tests are the detection of the "antinuclear antibody" or the "C-reactive protein".<br>
"AS" stands for Ankylosing Spondylitis, which is a chronic, progressive autoimmune disease characterized by arthritis, inflammation and eventual immobility of the joints, particularly the spinal joints. It causes pain and stiffness in the back (often in the morning hours) as a result of ongoing swelling and irritation of the spinal joints (vertebrae). Inflammation of the tendons and ligaments that connect and provide support to the vertebrae can lead to pain and tenderness in the ribs, shoulder blades, hips, thighs, shins, heels and along the bony points of the spines.<br>
If the compounds according to the present invention are said to be of use in treating pain associated with an inflammatory autoimmune disease of the joints, this refers to the administration of the compounds or combinations of the compounds of the present invention to reduce at least one pain symptom experienced by a subject suffering from an inflammatory autoimmune disease of the joints including back pain, joint pain and muscle pain associated with RA or AS. Besides the pain relief, treatment of an inflammatory autoimmune disease of the joints may also include a decrease of the inflammation and/or swelling of the synovium and may help to improve the functionality (i.e. maintaining mobility, and minimizing disability) of the joints, in particular in patients suffering from RA or AS.<br><br>
Treatment of "non-inflamrnatory musculoskeletal pain" refers to the administration of the compounds or combinations of the compounds of the present invention to reduce the pain experienced by a subject suffering from non-inflamrnatory musculoskeletal pain including back pain, fibromyalgia, and myofascial pain syndrome. One outcome of treatment may be reducing the pain experienced by the subject relative to the pain experienced by the subject immediately before the administration of the compounds or combinations of the present invention. Another outcome of treatment may be preventing reoccurence of pain which has previously been reduced as a result of pharmacotherapy. Another outcome of treatment may be decreasing the occurrence of and/or the severity of manifestations related to non-inflammatory musculoskeletal pain including back pain, fibromyalgia, and myofascial pain syndrome. The treatment may suitably result in a reduction of increased muscle sensitivity characterized by pain evoked by a normally non-nociceptive stimulus (allodynia) or increased pain intensity<br>
evoked by nociceptive stimuli (hyperalgesia). Finally, the treatment of non-inflammatory musculoskeletal pain can also improve the associated symptoms of back pain, fibromyalgia, and myofascial pain syndrome.<br>
The terms "fibromyalgia" or "FMS" relates to a syndrome that causes widespread pain and stiffness throughout the tissue that supports and moves bones and joints. Fibromyalgia can be diagnosed by the presence of excessive tenderness on applying pressure to at least 11 of 18 specific muscle-tendon sites.<br>
"Myofascial pain syndrome" is a chronic non-degenerative, non-inflammatory musculoskeletal pain condition. Distinct areas within muscles or their delicate connective tissue coverings (fascia) become abnormally thickened or tight. When the myofascial tissues tighten and lose their elasticity, neurotransmitter ability to send and receive messages between the brain and body is damaged. Symptoms include muscle stiffness and aching and sharp shooting pains or tingling and numbness in areas distant from the trigger point. Most commonly trigger points are in the neck, back, or buttocks.<br>
"Back pain" is a common non-inflammatory musculoskeletal pain condition that may be either acute or chronic. It may be caused by a variety of diseases and disorders that affect the lumbar spine. Low back pain is often accompanied by sciatica, which is pain that involves the sciatic nerve and is felt in the lower back, the buttocks, and the backs of the thighs.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are also useful for treating signs and symptoms of an overactive bladder such as urinary incontinence, more specific urinary urge incontinence, urinary stress incontinence, urinary urgency, nocturia and/or urinary frequency.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention are preferably adapted for oral administration. Alternatively, if skin diseases are to be treated the pharmaceutical composition containing the inventive compounds may be also formulated for topical or transcutaneous use.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention relates to a method for inhibiting vanilloid ligand from binding to vanilloid receptor in a patient, comprising contacting cells expressing vanilloid receptor in the patient with a compound of formula (I), (la), (Ib), (Ic) or (Id), an isomer thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>

Neonatal(2-3 day old or younger than 2-3 day old) SD rats were put in ice for 5 minutes to anesthetize and disinfected with 70% ethanol. DRG of all part of spinal cord were dissected (Wood et al., 1988, J. Neurosci. 8, pp3208-3220) and collected in DME/F12 medium to which 1.2g/l sodium bicarbonate, 50mg/l gentamycin were added. The DRG were incubated sequentially at 37°C for 30 min in 200 U/ml collagenase and 2.5mg/ml trypsin, separately. The ganglia were washed twice with DME/F12 medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, triturated through a fire-polished Pasteur pipette, filtered through Nitex 80 membrane to obtain single cell suspension and the<br>
suspension was washed once more. This was subjected to centrifugation, then resuspended in cell culture medium at certain level of cell density. As the cell culture medium, DME/F12 medium supplemented with 10% horse serum was diluted with identical medium conditioned by C6 glioma cells 2 days on a confluent monolayer (1:1), and NGF (Nerve Growth Factor) was added to adjust 200ng/ml as final concentration. After the cells were grown 2 days in medium where cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C, 100 pM) was added to kill dividing nonneuronal cells, medium was changed to one without Ara-C. The resuspended cells were plated at a density of 1500-2000 neurons/well onto Terasaki plates previously coated with 10 ug/ml poly-D-ornithine.<br>

DRG nerve cells from the primary culture of 2 days were equilibrated by washing 4 times with HEPES (10mM, pH 7.4)-buffered Ca 2+, Mg2+-free HBSS (H-HBSS). The solution in each well was removed from the individual well. Medium containing the test compound plus capsaicin (final concentration 0.5 pJvl) and 45Ca (final concentration 10 uCi/ml) in H-HBSS was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 10 mins. Terasaki plates were washed five times with H-HBSS and dried at room temperature. To each well, 0.3% SDS (10 nl) was added to elute 45Ca. After the addition of scintillation cocktail of into each well, the amount of ^Ca influx into neuron was measured by counting radioactivity. Antagonistic activities of test compounds against vanilloid receptor were calculated as percent of the inhibition of maximal response of capsaicin at a concentration of 0.5 \iM. In summary, all examples of the present invention showed good to excellent IC50 values between 20 and 500 nM,<br>
with most of the compounds having a IC50 values below 200 nM.<br>

3. Analgesic activity test: Mouse writhing test by inducing with phenyl-p-quinone<br>
Male ICR mice (mean body weight 25g) were maintained in a controlled lighting environment (12 h on/ 12 h off) for experiment. Animals received an intraperitoneal injection of 0.3ml of the chemical irritant phenyl-p-quinone (dissolved in saline containing 5% ethanol to be a dose of 4.5mg/kg) and 6 mins later, the number of abdominal constrictions was counted in the subsequent 6 mins period. Animals (10 animals/group) received 0.2ml of test compounds solution in vehicle of ethanol/Tween 80/saline (10/10/80) intraperitoneally 30 min before the injection of phenyl-p-quinone. A reduction in the number of writhes responding to the test drug compound relative to the number responding in saline control group was considered to be indicative of an analgesic effect. Analgesic effect was calculated by % inhibition equation (% inhibition=(C-T)/C x 100), wherein C and T represent the number of writhes in control and compound-treated group, respectively (Table 3).<br>
