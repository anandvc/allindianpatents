It has now surprisingly been found that the compounds of general formula I are metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. Compounds of formula I are distinguished by valuable therapeutic properties. They can be used in the treatment or prevention of mGluR5 receptor mediated disorders.<br>
In the central nervous system (CNS) the transmission of stimuli takes place by the interaction of a neurotransmitter, which is sent out by a neuron, with a neuroreceptor.<br>
Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and plays a unique role in a variety of central nervous system (CNS) functions. The glutamate-dependent stimulus receptors are divided into two main groups. The first main group, namely the ionotropic receptors, forms ligand-controlled ion channels. The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) belong to the second main group and, furthermore, belong to the family of G-protein coupled receptors.<br>
At present, eight different members of these mGluR are known and of these some even have sub-types. According to their sequence homology, signal transduction mechanisms and agonist selectivity, these eight receptors can be sub-divided into three sub-groups:<br>
mGluRl and mGluR5 belong to group I, mGluR2 and mGluR3 belong to group II and mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7 and mGIuR8 belong to group III.<br>
Ligands of metabotropic glutamate receptors belonging to the first group can be used for the treatment or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders such as psychosis, epilepsy, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, cognitive disorders and memory deficits, as well as chronic and acute pain.<br>
Other treatable indications in this connection are restricted brain function caused by bypass operations or transplants, poor blood supply to the brain, spinal cord injuries, head<br><br>
injuries, hypoxia caused by pregnancy, cardiac arrest and hypoglycaemia. Further treatable indications are Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), dementia caused by AIDS, eye injuries, retinopathy, idiopathic parkinsonism or parkinsonism caused by medicaments as well as conditions which lead to glutamate-deficiency functions, such as e.g. muscle spasms, convulsions, migraine, urinary incontinence, nicotine addiction, opiate addiction, anxiety, vomiting, dyskinesia and depressions.<br>
Disorders mediated full or in part by mGluR5 are for example acute, traumatic and chronic degenerative processes of the nervous system, such as Alzheimer's disease, senile dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis, psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia and anxiety, depression and pain. Selective mGluR5 antagonists are especially useful for the treatment of anxiety and pain.<br>
Objects of the present invention are the use of compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts for the manufacture of medicaments for the treatment or prevention of mGluR5 receptor mediated disorders, novel compounds of formula I-A or formula 1-B per se, their manufacture, medicaments based on a compound in accordance with the invention and their production as well as the use of compounds of formula I-A or formula 1-B for the treatment or prevention of mGluR5 receptor mediated disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, senile dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, cognitive disorders and memory deficits, cerebral ischemia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis, restricted brain functions caused by bypass operations or transplants, poor blood supply to the brain, spinal cord injuries, head injuries, hypoxia caused by pregnancy, cardiac arrest and hypoglycaemia, psychiatric diseases such as psychosis, epilepsy, schizophrenia and anxiety, depression as well as chronic and acute pain.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

This reaction is catalyzed by palladium(II) salts.<br>
In accordance with the invention, compounds of formula I, wherein A signifies -C=C-, are prepared by reacting an acetylene derivative of formula II, for example ethynylbenzene, with a suitable compound of formula III, for example 2-bromo-3,5-dimethyl-3H-imidazole-4-carboxylic acid ester. According to the method as described in Chem. Pharm. Ball 1987,35(2), 823-828 this palladium catalyzed C-C-coupling reaction requires the presence of bis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(II)-chloride, cuprous iodide and triethylamine and is carried out in a polar solvent like dimethylformamide or acetonitrile at a temperature of 90 °C to 100 °C within 1.5 to 3 hours. The reaction can also be carried out in the presence equimolar amounts of bis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(II)-chloride and triphenylphosphine and an excess of triethylamine at a temperature of 55 °C within 16 hours.<br>
The phenylethynyl derivatives of formula II are commercially available or can be • easily prepared by methods well known in the art.<br>
The compounds of formula III are also commercially available or can be prepared by appropiate methods depending on the heterocyclic system B.<br>
2-Halogeno-lH-imidazoles of formula III (B = Bl) are prepared according to methods as described in US Patent No. (USP) 4,711,962, USP 3,341,548 and Synth. Commun. 1989,19,2551-2566.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, drag£es, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. However, the administration can also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The compounds of formula I and pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts thereof can be processed with pharmaceutical^ inert, inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like; depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose and the like. Adjuvants, such as alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils and the like, can be used for aqueous injection solutions of water-soluble salts of compounds of formula I, but as a rule are not necessary. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.<br>
In addition, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
As mentioned earlier, medicaments containing a compound of formula IA or IB or pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts thereof and a therapeutically inert excipient are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for. the production of such medicaments which comprises bringing one or more compounds of formula IA or IB or pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts thereof and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical dosage form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.<br>
The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, the effective dosage for oral or parenteral administration is between 0.01-20 mg/kg/day, with a dosage of 0.1-10 mg/ kg/day being preferred for all of the indications described. The daily dosage for an adult human being weighing 70 kg accordingly lies between 0.7-1400 mg per day, preferably between 7 and 700 mg per day.<br><br>
Finally, as mentioned earlier, the use of compounds of formula I and of pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts thereof for the production of medicaments, especially for the for the treatment or prevention of mGiuR5 receptor mediated disorders of the aforementioned kind, is also an object of the invention.<br>
The following examples are provided for illustration of the invention. They should not be considered as limiting the scope of the invention, but merely as being representative thereof.<br>
