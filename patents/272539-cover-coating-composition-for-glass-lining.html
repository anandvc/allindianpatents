				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
RARE EAETH METAL COMPLEX. CATALYST FOR POLYMERIZATION AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING POLYMER<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a rare earth metal complex and a process for producing the same, a catalyst for olefin or lactone polymerization containing the rate earth metal complex, as well as a process for producing a polymer of an olefin or of a polar monomer such as a lactone.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002] A metallocene complex having one cyclopentadiene ligand is a compound which is called a half metallocene complex and utilized as a catalytic component for polymerizing various olefins, and it is known that the property thereof (a catalytic activity on a polymerization reaction) greatly varies depending on the kind of its central metal.    Inter alia, it is known that a polymerization catalytic component comprising a half metallocene complex having a Group 3 metal or a lanthanoid metal (hereinafter, a Group 3 metal and a lanthanoid metal are collectively referred to as rare earth metals) as a central metal can be used in the polymerization or copolymerization of ethylene and cr olefins, the polymerization or copolymerization of aromatic olefin monomers such as styrene, and the polymerization or copolymerization of cyclic olefin monomers such as norbornene (see WO 2006/004068).    It is also known that such a half metallocene complex having a rare earth metal as a central metal can be used in the polymerization of cyclohexene oxide, and the copolymerization of cyclohexene oxide and carbon dioxide (see<br><br>
Macromolecules 2005, 38, 4089).    It is known that a half metallocene complex having lanthanum as a central metal can be used in the syndiotactic polymerization of a methacrylate ester, the block copolymerization of ethylene and a methacrylate ester, the polymerization of isocyanide. and the polymerization of acrylonitrile (see J. Polym. Sci.: Part A: Polym. Chem. 2001, 39, 1382).   Thus, the half metallocene complex having a rare earth metal as a central metal is a useful metal complex for which many utilities are expected.   On the other hand, as a metal complex having a ligand in which a cyclopentadiene derivative and a phenol derivative are linked with a Group 14 atom, a Group 4 transition metal complex is known as a catalyst for olefin polymerization (see JP-A-09-87313), but no rare earth metal complex is known.<br>
[0003] The polymers of lactone compounds such as e~caprolactone which can be industrially produced at low cost are useful as modifiers for polyurethane, coating resins and plastics.    Among those polymers, particularly the lactone polymer with a high molecular weight attracts attention as a biodegradable polymer.   As a process for producing the high-molecular weight polymer of a lactone, a method of ring-opening polymerization of a lactone using a rare earth alkoxide as a catalyst (see WO 91/05001), or a method of ring-opening polymerization of a lactone using a rare earth complex having a cyclopentadiene ligand as a catalyst is known (see JPA-05-247184).   After that, regarding the ring-opening polymerization of a lactone using a rare earth complex as a catalyst, efforts for efficiently obtaining a polymer having a narrow molecular weight distribution have been reported (see Macromolecules 1999, 29, 1798).<br>

[0076] The polymerization process is not particularly limited, and for example, solution polymerization or slurry polymerization using an aliphatic hydrocarbon (butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane or the like), an aromatic hydrocarbon (benzene, toluene or the like) or a halogenated hydrocarbon (methylene dichloride or the like) as a solvent, vapor phase polymerization in a gaseous monomer or the like is possible, and either continuous polymerization, or batch polymerization is possible. [0077] A polymerization temperature is usually in a range of-50Â°C to 300Â°C, particularly in a range of-20Â°C to 250Â°C.   Apolymerization pressure is preferably an atmospheric pressure to 90 MPa.   In general, a polymerization time is determined appropriately depending on the kind of the intended polymer, and a reactor, and a time in a range of 1 minute to 20 hours may be adopted.   Furthermore, in the present invention, a chain transfer agent such as hydrogen may be added in order to adjust the molecular weight of a polymer. [0078] <process for producing polymer of polar monomer><br>
Using the rare earth complex (l) of the present invention, a polar<br><br>
monomer may be homopolymerized, or a certain polar monomer and a different polar monomer may be copolymerized.    The kind of the polar monomer is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include lactones, alkylene oxides, (meth)acrylate esters and the like. [0079]  [Process for producing lactone polymer]<br>
Examples of the lactones used in the present invention include p-propiolactone, ybutyrolactone, 5-valerolactone, e-caprolactone, p-methylpropiolactone, 3,3.5-trimethyl-e-caprolactone and the like, and preferably e-caprolactone.<br>
[0080] These lactones may be polymerized alone while a mixture of two or more lactones may be copolymerized.    A method of copolymerizing two or more lactones is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include a method of initiating polymerization under such a condition that two or more lactones are present simultaneously to obtain a random copolymer, and a method of polymerizing the first lactone in advance, and then adding the second or subsequent lactone(s) to obtain a block copolymer. [0081] The polymerization method is not particularly limited, and for example, solution polymerization or slurry polymerization using an aliphatic hydrocarbon (butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane or the like), an aromatic hydrocarbon (benzene, toluene or the like) or a halogenated hydrocarbon (methylene dichloride or the like) as a solvent can be employed, and either continuous polymerization or batch polymerization is possible. [0082] Apolymerization temperature is usually in a range of -80Â°C to 150Â°C, particularly in a range of -30Â°C to 100Â°C.   In general, a polymerization time is determined appropriately depending on the kind of the intended polymer. and a reactor and, for example, a time in a range of 1 second to 24 hours can be adopted. [0083] Preferably, the polymerization reaction is performed under an<br><br>
atmosphere of an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon.    It is important for<br>
the efficient preparation of a polymer that the inert gas and the lactone<br>
monomer are sufficiently dried so as to be free from water.<br>
[0084] The resultant lactone polymer contains a metal catalytic component.<br>
However, when a polymerization degree is high, it is not necessary to remove<br>
the metal catalytic component since the content of the contained metal<br>
catalytic component is relatively small.    When the removal of the metal<br>
catalytic component is necessary, the lactone polymer as produced is washed<br>
with water or dilute hydrochloric acid to remove the metal catalytic<br>
component, followed by drying, to obtain the lactone polymer containing no<br>
metal catalytic component.<br>
[0085] It is possible to produce a polymer of lactones of the present invention<br>
at a relatively low temperature.    In this case, the polymer has such<br>
characteristics that it has excellent color tone, and little odor, since the<br>
amount of mixed impurities generated by depolymerization or thermal<br>
degradation of the lactone polymer is small.<br>
[0086] The resultant lactone polymer may be pelletized with an extruder,<br>
and can be used as a film, a fiber, an expanded sheet or various molded<br>
articles.<br>

[0088] These alkylene oxides may be polymerized alone, while a mixture of two or more alkylene oxides may be copolymerized.    A method of<br><br>
copolymerizing two or more alkylene oxides is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include a method of initiating polymerization under such a condition that two or more alkylene oxides are present simultaneously to obtain a random copolymer, and a method of polymerizing the first alkylene oxide in advance, and then adding the second or subsequent alkylene oxide(s) to obtain a block copolymer.<br>
[0089] A method of initiating polymerization is not particularly limited. For example, an alkylene oxide is added to the solution of the rare earth metal complex (l) to initiate polymerization, or the rare earth metal complex (l) is added to the solution of an alkylene oxide to initiate polymerization. [0090] A polymerization method is not particularly limited, and solution polymerization or slurry polymerization using an aliphatic hydrocarbon (butane, heptane, hexane, heptane, octane or the like), an aromatic hydrocarbon (benzene, toluene or the like), an ether (diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane or the like), or a halogenated hydrocarbon (dichlorom ethane, dichloroethane or the like) can be employed, and either continuous polymerization or batch polymerization is possible. [0091] A polymerization temperature is usually in a range of-80Â°C to 150Â°C, particularly in a range of-30Â°C to 100Â°C.   In general, a reaction time is determined appropriately depending on the kind of the intended polymer, and a reactor, and for example, a time in a range of 1 second to 24 hours can be adopted.<br>
[0092] Preferably, the polymerization reaction is performed under an atmosphere of an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon.   It is important for the efficient preparation of a polymer that the inert gas and an alkylene oxide are sufficiently dried so as to be free from water.

necessary to remove the metal catalytic component since the content of the<br>
contained metal catalytic component is relatively small.    When the removal<br>
of the metal catalytic component is necessary, the alkylene oxide polymer as<br>
produced is washed with water or dilute hydrochloric acid to remove the<br>
metal catalytic component, followed by drying, to obtain an alkylene oxide<br>
polymer.<br>
[0094] The resultant alkylene oxide polymer can be used as a film, a fiber,<br>
an expanded sheet or various molded articles.<br>

[0096] These (meth)acrylate esters may be polymerized alone, while a mixture of two or more (meth)acrylate esters may be copolymerized.    A method of copolymerizing two or more (meth) acrylate esters is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include a method of initiating polymerization under such a condition that two or more (meth) acrylate esters are present simultaneously, to obtain a random copolymer, and a method of polymerizing the first (meth)acrylate ester in advance, and then adding the second or subsequent (meth)acrylate ester(s) to obtain a block copolymer.<br>
[0097] Amethod of initiating polymerization is not particularly limited. For example, a (meth)acrylate ester is added to the solution of the rare earth metal complex (l) to initiate polymerization, or the rare earth metal complex<br><br>
(l) is added to the solution of a (meth)acrylate ester to initiate polymerization.<br>
[0098]  The polymerization method is not particularly limited, and for example, solution polymerization or slurry polymerization using an aliphatic hydrocarbon (butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane or the like), an aromatic hydrocarbon (benzene, toluene or the like), an ether (diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane or the like), or a halogenated hydrocarbon (dichlorom ethane, dichloroethane or the like) as a solvent can be employed, and either continuous polymerization or batch polymerization can be employed.<br>
[0099] A polymerization temperature is usually in a range of-80Â°C to 150Â°C, particularly preferably in a range of -30Â°C to 100Â°C.    In general, a polymerization time is determined appropriately depending on the kind of the intended polymer, and a reactor and. for example, a time in a range of 1 second to 24 hours can be adopted.<br>
[0100] Preferably, the polymerization reaction is performed under an atmosphere of an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon.    It is important for the efficient preparation of a polymer that the inert gas and a (meth)acrylate ester monomer are sufficiently dried so as to be free from water. [0101] The resultant (meth)acrylate ester polymer contains a metal catalytic component.    However, when a polymerization degree is high, it is not necessary to remove the metal catalytic component since the content of the contained metal catalytic component is relatively small.   When the removal of the metal catalytic component is necessary, the (meth)acrylate ester polymer as produced is washed with water or dilute hydrochloric acid to remove the metal catalytic component, followed by drying, to obtain the (meth)acrylate ester polymer. [0102]  The resultant (meth)acrylate ester polymer can be used as a film, a<br><br>
