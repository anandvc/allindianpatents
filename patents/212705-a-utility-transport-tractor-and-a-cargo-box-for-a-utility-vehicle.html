				<td>2 FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a utility transport tractor and to a cargo box for such a tractor.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Agricultural tractors are designed primarily to supply power to agricultural implements and to produce a continuous draft force in the direction of travel to enable soil engaging implements to perform their intended functions. Agricultural tractors must be designed with sufficient downward force acting on the drive wheels to produce the desired draft force. Often this results in a vehicle having drive wheels that are larger than the non-drive wheels to accommodate the large downward force on the drive wheels. Agricultural tractors differ from cargo carrying vehicles such as trucks in that trucks do not need to produce a continuous draft load. A truck only needs to produce a draft load when pulling a load during periods of acceleration and deceleration.<br>
An agricultural tractor, designed primarily to produce a draft load, has limited, if any, ability to carry cargo. A farmer must use a truck or a wagon hitched to a tractor to haul cargo. Other cargo hauling utility vehicles, such as a John Deere Gator utility vehicle can also be used. Trucks and utility vehicles, however, have shortcomings when working with agricultural implements. They do not have the tractive ability of an agricultural tractor and are generally not equipped with a<br><br>
3<br>
three point hitch. In small farm operations where it is not practical to buy several pieces of equipment, it is beneficial to have a utility transport tractor that combines the typical features of an agricultural tractor with the capability to carry cargo. Past attempts to combine tractors and trucks have focused on adding a three point hitch to a truck. These products suffer from poor performance in pulling an implement and often lack visibility typical of a tractor.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a utility transport tractor and a cargo box with which the recited problems are overcome and the desires are met. In particular it should be able to carry cargo with an conventional utility tractor, such as an agricultural tractor.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The utility transport tractor of the present invention has both the typical features of a conventional agricultural tractor and the capability to carry cargo. The tractor of the present invention modifies a tractor to include cargo carrying capability and is only slightly modified from a conventional tractor. The wheel base has been extended to move the rear axle rearward relative to the operator's station. The extension of the wheel base provides room above the rear axle to mount a cargo box. Since the operator's station is now forward of the rear wheels, there is enough lateral space on the operator's station for<br><br>
4<br>
additional seats to carry passengers. The additional seats are to the side of the operator and are located forward and downward from the operator's seat. This allows the operator to see over the top of the passengers and moves the shoulders of the passengers forward of the operator's shoulders to increase occupant comfort.<br>
The cargo box has an upright front wall, left and right side walls and a tail gate to easily contain loose materials such as soil, gravel or sand. The tail gate is hinged to the side walls in a manner that enables the tail gate to pivot from an upright closed position to four different open positions by rotating the tail gate about four separate axes. The tail gate can rotate about a lower horizontal axis at the bottom of the tail gate, about an upper horizontal axis at the top of the tail gate and about left and right upright axes at the left and right sides of the tail gate respectively.<br>
The tail gate is rotatable about the upper horizontal axis to a upwardly and forwardly inclined position. Likewise, a rear portion of the cargo box floor is also rotatable to a forwardly and upwardly inclined position. In these inclined positions, the tail gate and the rear portion of the floor are inclined generally toward the eyes of an operator. In these raised positions, the operator seated on his vehicle seat is able to see the three point hitch and the implement attached thereto.<br>
The cargo box has a metal frame structure attached to the tractor chassis. The side walls, front wall and tail gate are preferably formed of plastic panels while<br><br>
5<br>
the floor and wheel well portion of the cargo box are formed of sheet metal. The cargo box is preferably build as a separate component which optionally may be mounted to the vehicle or moved from the vehicle. The use of plastic components reduces the weight of the cargo box and the manufacturing cost. The plastic is also dent resistant and does not need to be painted. The tail gate is mounted to the side walls by four identical hinges at the four corners of the tail gate to reduce the number of separate components used to attach the tail gate.<br>
The utility transport tractor of the present invention retains the typical agricultural tractor configuration of large rear drive wheels for improved traction. The tractor further retains a three point hitch and assures visibility of the hitch by configuring the cargo box with one or more movable panels to enable an operator seated on the operator's station to view the three point hitch and implement.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF INVENTION<br>
With reference to FIG. 1, the utility transport tractor of the present invention is shown and designated generally as 10. The tractor 10 has a front hood 12 covering an engine, rear drive wheels 14 on a rear axle 15 and front wheels 16 on a front axle 17, all part of a tractor chassis 19. The front wheels 16 can be driven or non-driven. An operator's station 18 is located forward of the rear wheels and includes a center operator's seat 20 and left and right passenger seats 22, 24. A cargo box 26 is located rearward of the operator's station 18 and generally above the rear axle and rear wheels 14, A three point hitch 28 (FIG. 2) is mounted behind the rear axle and beneath the cargo box 26. The three point hitch includes a pair of lower draft links 30 and an upper link 32.<br>
The cargo box 26 has a generally horizontal floor 34 (FIG. 2), an upright front wall 36, left and right side walls 38 and a tail gate 40 (FIG. 1) at the rear of the<br><br>
7<br>
vehicle 10. The cargo box side walls form fender wells 41 (FIG. 3) for the rear wheels with a portion of the cargo box being disposed above the rear wheels. Fenders 43 are attached to the tractor chassis and are shaped to fit within the wheel wells 41. The cargo box has a pair of side frame rails 108 made of metal. The floor 34 and the bottom portions 45 of the side walls 38 are also metal. The upper portions 47 of the side walls 38, the front wall 36 and the tail gate 40 are molded of plastic. The plastic panels resist dents and are molded with color to avoid the need to be painted.<br>
The tail gate 40 consists of a panel 42 mounted to a bar member 44 shaped as a rectangular frame. At both the top and bottom of the tail gate 40, the bar member 44 has horizontal projections 49 that extend laterally outward beyond the sides of the panel 42 and then bend vertically to form left and right handles 50, 52. The horizontal projections are captured in hinged latch mechanisms 54 at the four corners of the tail gate. The four hinged latch mechanisms 54 are all identical to one another and are shown in greater detail with reference to FIG. 4. Each latch mechanism 54 includes a yoke 56 fastened to the respective side wall of the cargo box by a pair of bolts 58. A latch receiver 60 is mounted in the yoke 56 for rotation by a vertical pivot pin 62, enabling the latch receiver 60 to pivot about the upright axis of the pin 62. The latch receiver 60 is generally U-shaped, having a lower leg 64 and an upper leg 66 forming an open slot 68 therebetween. The slot 68 receives the horizontal projection 49 of the bar member 44 at corner of the tail gate.<br><br>
8<br>
A catch 70 is pivotally mounted to the upper leg 66 by a pivot 72 and is biased downward into the slot 68 by a spring 74. The catch 70 has an inclined surface 76 that enables the catch 70 to be pushed upward into the upper leg 66, compressing the spring 74, in response to the bar member 44 being pushed into the slot 68. Once the bar member clears the catch 70, the spring 74 will urge the Catch 70 back into the slot 68, trapping the bar member therein. A lift lever 78 is connected to the catch 70 by a link 80. The lift lever 78 has a cam surface 82 by which the lift lever 78 will raise the catch 70 when the rear end 84 of the lift lever 78 is manually raised to free the bar member to open the tail gate 40.<br>
The tail gate 40 can be opened by pivoting the tail gate 40 downward about a lower horizontal axis 86 (FIG. 3) defined by the portion of the bar member 44 extending horizontally through the bottom portion 48 of the tail gate 40. This is accomplished by releasing the bar member at the two upper latch mechanisms 54 and rotating the tail gate 40 about the axis 86. Likewise, the tail gate 40 can be pivoted upward by rotation about the upper axis 88 defined by the bar member 44 extending horizontally through the top portion 46 of the tail gate 40.<br>
The tail gate 40 can also be pivoted to the left or to the right like a door. The tail gate 40 is pivoted to the right by first releasing the two left side latch mechanisms 54. This allows the tail gate 40, together with the latch receivers 60 on the right side, to pivot about the upright axis 90 defined by the pivot pins 62 of the two right side latch mechanisms 54. The tail gate 40 pivots to the left by rotation about the axis 92 defined by the pivot pins 62 of the two left side latch<br><br>
9<br>
mechanisms 54. All four hinge latch mechanisms 54 are identical, reducing the number of different components in the cargo box 26. Secondary latch pins 94 (FIG. 4) can be installed in each of the latch mechanisms 54 behind the bar member 44 to lock the bar member 44 in the latch mechanism 54. The latch pins 94 prevent inadvertent release of the bar member 44.<br>
A cable 96 is attached at one end to each upper latch mechanism 54. A hook 98 is fastened to the other end of each cable 96 and receives the upper portion of the bar member 44. The cable 96 acts as a stop to hold the tail gate 40 in a generally horizontal open position when the tail gate 40 is lowered about the axis 86. The hook 98 is removable from the bar member 44 to enable the tail gate 40 to be opened to either the left or the right sides.<br>
The cargo box floor 34 has a front portion 104 that is fixed in position. A rear portion 106 of the floor is pivotally mounted to cargo box frame rails 108. The rear portion 106 is rotatably mounted by the hinge mechanism 112 (FIG. 5) to rotate to a forwardly and upwardly inclined position shown in FIG. 2. Likewise, the tail gate 40 can also raised to a forwardly and upwardly inclined position. In the forwardly and upwardly inclined positions, the floor rear portion 106 and tail gate 40 generally extend toward the eyes of a vehicle operator 102 seated in the center seat 20. In these raised positions of the tailgate 40 and floor rear portion 106, the visibility of the three point hitch 28, which is generally beneath the rear portion 106 of the floor, is improved. This enables the operator 102 to see the hitch 28 when backing the tractor to an implement and also to monitor the implement when performing a field operation. In addition, the upper link 32 of<br><br>
10<br>
the hitch 28 can be raised above the cargo box floor. By raising the floor rear portion 106, a full range of motion can be provided with the hitch 28 without moving the hitch rearward relative to the rear axle.<br>
The floor rear portion 106 pivots about a hinge pin 114 that is mounted to the cargo box frame rails 108 and extend laterally across the cargo box 40. Spaced tubes 116 are fixed to the down turned flange 117 at the front edge of the floor rear portion 106. The hinge pin 114 extends through the tubes 116. The floor rear portion 106 carries a latch mechanism 118 on -the bottom side of the floor 34. The latch mechanism 118 includes a spring biased pin 120 that is urged against the surface of the rail 108 by a spring 124. When the floor rear portion 106 is raised to the hitch viewing position, the floor rear portion 106 is held in place by the pin 120 seated into an aperture 122 in the side rail 108. When it is desired to lower the panel 106, the pin 120 is retracted from the aperture 122 and the floor rear portion 106 rotates away from the hitch viewing position. The pivoting floor rear portion 106 and the upward pivoting tail gate maintain visibility of the hitch common to conventional agricultural tractors.<br>
The utility transport tractor of the present invention includes the features and function of a typical agricultural tractor and adds to it the ability to carry cargo. The hitch is retained generally in the same location relative to the rear axle and visibility of the hitch is maintained even though a cargo box is added above the rear axle. The cargo box as many as convenient features particularly related to the tail gate hinges.<br><br>
