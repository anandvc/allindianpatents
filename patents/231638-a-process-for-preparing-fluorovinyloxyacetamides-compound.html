				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates a process for preparing fluorovinyloxyacctamidc compounds.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
Due to the perpetual emergence of weeds resistant to the herbicide in use, there always exists a need to develop a new class of effective herbicides that can protect crops without harming the environment. For example, the sulfonylurca-based herbicides that have been widely used in controlling rice-field weeds for the last two decades have now become less effective, particularly in controlling annual weeds. Accordingly, many attempts have been made to develop new rice-field herbicides of different chemical classes, including those based on amides and carbamates.<br>
There has recently been reported a new class of herbicides based on<br>
helcroaryloxyaeetamide derivatives (DE Patent No. 2903966; DE Patent No.<br>
3038636; DE Patent No. 3323334; DE Patent No. 3344236; DE Patent No. 3418167;<br>
DE: Patent No. 3422861; DE Patent No. 440596; WO 95/34560; WO 96/08488; WO<br>
96/11575; WO 96/28434; and WO 97/08160).	However, these<br>
heteroaryloxyacctamides have limited herbicidal activity against a narrow spectrum of weeds.<br>

(Scheme Removed) <br>
wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 have the same meanings as defined in formula (I) above.<br>
An alcoholic compound of formula (II) may be prepared by substitution, acetylation and hydrolysis of an amine of formula (VI) according to a conventional method(Hamm, P.C., J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 78, 2556 (1956); Hartman, W.W. et al., Org. Syn.. Coll., 1, 650 (1955); and Brasen, W.R. et al., Org. Syn. . Coll. . 1, 582 (1963)), as shown in Reaction Scheme B:<br>

(Scheme Removed)<br>
 wherein R1 and R2 have the same meanings as defined in formula (I) above.<br>
A difluorovinyl compound of formula (III) may be prepared form a halogen compound of formula (VIII) by Grignard and Wittig reactions(Herkes, F.E. et al., J. Org. Chem., 32, 1311 (1967); and Wheaton, G.A. et al., J. Org. Chem., 48, 917 (1983)), as shown in Reaction Scheme C:<br>
Reaction Scheme C(Scheme Removed) <br>
wherein X is Br or Cl; and R3 and R4 have the same meanings as defined in formula (I) above.<br>
As shown in Reaction Scheme A, the fluorovinyloxyacetamide compound of the present invention may be prepared by reacting an alcoholic compound of formula<br>
(II)	with a fluorovinyl compound of formula (III) in the<br>
presence of a base.  Each of compounds of formula (II) and<br>
(III)	may be used in equimolar amounts and the base may be<br>
used in one to two equivalent amounts.  The base may be an<br>
inorganic base, e.g., sodium hydride, potassium hydride,<br>
potassium t-butoxide , sodium hydroxide , potassium hydroxide ,<br>
sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate; or an organic base,<br>
e.g., triethylamine or pyridine.  The solvent which may be<br>
used in the reaction is benzene, toluene, tetrahydrofuran,<br>
acetone, acetonitrile, dichloromethane, dimethylformamide or<br>
dimethylsulfoxide, individually or combined with water. The<br>
reaction may be conducted at a temperature ranging from room<br>
temperature to 100 °C.  The progress of the reaction is<br>
conveniently followed by measuring the disappearance of the<br>
compound   of   formula    (II)   with   thin   layer<br>
chromatography(TLC).<br>
The compound of the present invention is obtained as a mixture of two isomers, i.e., the E and Z. isomers.<br>
For example, in the case of the compound of the present invention wherein R1 is phenyl, R2 is methyl, R3 "is phenyl and R4 is CF3(Compound 1), a 2:1 mixture of the £ and E_ isomers is obtained, the isomer ratio being determined on<br>
the basis of both 1H-NMR and 19F-NMR analysis of the product. Namely, the peak area ratio of the 1H-NMR peak for the methylene group of the Z. isomer(a singlet at 4.30 ppm relative to CHC13) to that of E isomer(a singlet at 4.49 ppm) is about 2:1; and 19F-NMR analysis(reference compound: CFC13) shows a peak area ratio of about 2:1 when the peaks for the fluorine and CF3 substituents of the £ isomer(a quartet having a coupling constant of 24.08 Hz at -84.99 ppm and a doublet having a coupling constant of 25.07 Hz at -57.36 ppm, respectively) are compared with those of the E isomer(a quartet having a coupling constant of 12.43 Hz at -83.40 ppm and a doublet having a coupling constant of 12.66 Hz at -57.95 ppm, respectively).<br>
Likewise, the preparation of the compound of the present invention wherein R1 and R2 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form a piperidino group, R3 is phenyl and R4 is CF3( Compound 221) leads to a 2:1 mixture of the Z and E. isomers. Namely, the peak area ratio of the 1H-NMR peak for the methylene group of the ZL isomer(a singlet at 4.67 ppm) to that of the E isomer(a singlet 4.79 ppm) is about 2:1; and the 19F-NMR analysis(reference compound: CFC13) shows a peak area ratio of 2:1 when the peaks for the fluorine and CF3 substituent of the Z. isomer(a quartet having a coupling constant of 25.15 Hz at -84.28 ppm and a doublet having a coupling constant of 24.85 Hz at -57.38 ppm, respectively) are compared with those of the E isomer(a quartet having a coupling constant of 12.46 Hz at -82.24 ppm and a doublet having a coupling constant of 12.32 Hz at -57.83 ppm, respectively).<br>
The compound of the present invention has herbicidal activity against a broad spectrum of weeds, in particular, against those belonging to the Gramineae family, e.g., rice(Qryza satiya L. ) , barnyardgrass (Echinochlora crus-galli 8P. BEAUV. var. oryzicola OHWI), bulrush(Scirpus juncoides ROXB), umbrellaplant (Cyperus difformis L.), flat-sedqefCyperus serotinus ROTTB), dayflower(Aneilema keisak<br>
HASSK), monochoria(Monochoria vaginalis PRESL), toothcup(Rotala indic.a KOEHE) and arrow head( Saglttarja pygmaea MIQ).<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also includes within its scope a herbicidal composition comprising one or more of the compounds of formula (I) as an active ingredient, in association with herbicidally acceptable carriers.<br>
The herbicidal composition of the invention may be formulated in various forms such as an emulsion, aqueous dispersion, powder and granules which may contain herbicidally acceptable carriers and additives. The compound of the formula (I) may be used in an amount of 10 to 90 % on the basis of the weight of an emulsion or aqueous dispersion, 0.1 to 10% on the basis of the weight of powder, 1 to 30 % on the basis of the weight of granules.<br>
Herbicidally acceptable carrier that may be used in the composition of the present invention is a liquid carrier, e.g., water, an alcohol(ethanol, ethylene glycol, glycerine), ketone(acetone, methylethyIketone), ether(dioxane , tetrahydrofuran, cellosolve), aliphatic hydrocarbon(gaso1ine , Kerosene), halogenated hydrocarbon(chloroform, carbon tetrachloride ) , amide(dimethylformamide), ester(ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, fatty glycerine ester) and acetonitrile; and a solid carrier, e.g., mineral particle(Kaoline, clay, bentonite, dolomite, talc, silica, sand) and vegetable powder(shrubs).<br>
The additive that may be used in the herbicidal composition of the present invention includes an emulsifier, adhesive, dispersion agent or permeating agent, e.g., nonionic, anionic or cationic interface active agent(fatty acid sodium salt, polyoxy alkyl ester, alkyl sulfonate ester). Further, an agrochemically active ingredient, e.g., an insecticide, fungicide, plant growth regulator, germicide, and fertilizer, may be added in the composition of the present invention.<br>

Herbicidal Activity Test<br>
Herbicidal activity tests were conducted using test plants planted in screening pots as follows.<br>
Each of screening pots, having the shape of a cube and a top surface area of 140 cm2, was filled with a wet mixture of paddy soil and a suitable amount of fertilizer, and sowed thereto were 100 barnyardgrass seeds, 20 bulrush seeds, 50 monochoria seeds, 2 flat-sedge tubers and 2 arrow head tubers(see Table 6). Two rice plant seedlings at the 3-leaf stage were then transplanted thereto, followed by filling water to a depth of 3 cm and kept in a greenhouse for 2 days .<br>
Added to each of the screening pots thus prepared was 4 ml of a 50% acetone solution containing .0.1% Tween-20 and a predetermined amount of each of the compounds listed in Tables 4 and 5 so that the amount of the compound applied would correspond to 4, 1, 0.25, 0.0625 or 0.015 kg/ha. Then, the pot was kept in a greenhouse for 2 to 3 weeks.<br>
The herbicidal activity was determined according to the procedure of Table 7 which was described by Frans et al. , In research methods in weed science, ed. by Camper, 29-70 (1986) and Cho, K.Y., Search Report by Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology. 916 (1989))". The results are shown in Table 8. <br><br>
