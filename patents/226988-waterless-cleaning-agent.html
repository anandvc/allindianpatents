This invention relates to human necessities. This invention further relates to a cleaning composition. More particularly this invention relates to a leaning composition, which use very little water. This cleaning composition removes dirt on any surface with minimum use of water, apply the cleaning composition on the surface to be cleaned, wipe the surface with wet cloth, the dirt will be removed.<br>
At the outset of the description which follows it is to be understood, that ensuring description only illustrate a particular from of this invention. However, such particular form is only an exemplary embodiment without intending to imply any limitation on the scope of this invention. Accordingly, the description is to be understood as an exemplary embodiment and reading of the invention is not intended to be taken restrictively.<br>
The invention claimed in JP publication no. 07-233393, 60-026681, 11-269489 ,ll-148099,shows few chemicals are same but in different composition. All the patents issued by Japanese patent's authority was having few same chemicals was used in the formulation. The patent approved by Japanese patent office on the bases of respective formulation. In the same manner in my invention, I am using few chemicals, which may be used in other formulations.<br>
The foregoing description is outlined rather broadly preferred and alternative feature of the present ir^vention so that those skilled in the art may better understand the detailed description of the invention that follows. Additional features of the invention will be described hereinafter that from the subject of claims of the invention. Those skilled in the art should appreciate that they can readily use the disclosed conception and specific embodiment as a basis for designing and modifying other structures for carrying out the same purpose of the present invention. Those skilled in the art should realize such equivalent conception do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention in its broadest form.<br><br>
A  cleaning  composition   comprising   the  following   raw  materials  in   the<br>
proportion for each 100 grams by weight is as under.<br>
1.	Phosphoric acid	-	15 to 20%<br>
2.	Oxalic acid	-	2 to 5%<br>
3.	Sodium lauryl ethyl sulfonate -	10 to 20 %<br>
4.	Sodium lauryl ethyl oxalate    -	5 to 10%<br>
The said composition being such that very little water is required (to wet the cleaning cloth) while washing anything.<br>
Now the invention will be described in the following description. Raw materials used for this cleaning composition is as follows:<br>
1.	Phosphoric acid<br>
2.	Oxalic acid<br>
3.	Sodium lauryl ethyl sulfonate<br>
4.	Sodium lauryl ethyl oxalate Method of process<br>
A  cleaning  composition  comprising  the  following  Raw  materials  in  the proposition for each 100 grams by weight is as under<br>
1.	Phosphoric acid	-	15 to 20%<br>
2.	Oxalic acid	-	2 to 5%<br>
3.	Sodium lauryl ethyl sulfonate -	10 to 20%<br>
4.	Sodium lauryl ethyl oxalate    -	5 to 10%<br>
5.	Distilled water	-	to 100ml<br>
Dissolve 5% oxalic acid in 20 phosphoric acid add 50% of distilled water. Add 5% sodium lauryl ethyl oxalate and mix well Add 20% sodium lauryl ethyl sulfonate Mix very slowly<br><br>
The cleaning connpositlon as such produces the synergic effect in that the composition act as a very good cleaning composition which does not require large amount of water to wash anything. The fact that the cleaning composition thus not require large amount of water has been already experimented and can be easily demonstrated<br>
Wet the cloth with the cleaning liquid (my invention) and clean surface, after applying the cleaning liquid there is no necessary to apply water to clean the surface. Wet the cloth in plain water and wipe the surface. In this cleaning process water is used only very little, for example if you want clean one Sq meter painted surface you requires minimum lOlitres of water if you use my invention you require only 500ml to wet the cloth. You are saving 9.5litres of water.<br>
The regular cleaning agents available in the market are alkaline this will react with the paint and it will reduce the glassiness of the paint if the cleaning agent is alkaline in nature it requires more water to clean the surface after applying the liquid.<br>
My Invention does not require more water to clean. Dust the painted surface to clean then apply my invention with cloth. (Wet the cloth with my invention) it will remove all the deposited dirt. Allow to dry then wipe with a dry cloth the surface will come to original status. If you wipe with a white cloth you can't see any colour in the cloth that means the my invention is not removing any paint from the surface<br>
In the above process, we are not using water to clean the surface. That is why I am claiming water - less cleaning agent<br>
A cleaning study was made in the Chennai coach-cleaning yard Chennai division. Railway department spending huge amount to clean the outside of the coach. Some times, they are not able to remove the diesel smoke strains on the coach. In such case, they will send the coach for repainting. Using my<br><br>
invention I took a cleaning study on the railway coaches and photos enclosed. It is very big breakthrough in washing the railway coaches. The railway department Is using very huge amount of water to wash the exterior of the coach. My using my invention we found water is required only to wet a cloth to clean the exterior of the railway coaches<br>
(Photos Enclosed')<br>
Spray my invention on the glass surface and wait for some time then wipe with wet cloth and finally with dry cloth.<br>
For mild dirt spray my invention and clean with a dry cloth<br>
Spray my invention on the wood surface and clean with dry cloth<br>
Spray my invention on the toilet pan and the footrest. After brushing, flush the toilet. In the flushing, you need not use large amount of water. It will remove all strains and yellow colour.<br>
Spray my invention on the walls of the bathroom and wipe with a dry cloth.<br>
Advantage of intention<br>
1.	Water Is not required in large amount to wash any thing.<br>
2.	Wipe the area to be cleaned with my invention and then clean the area with wet cloth.<br>
3.	By this method the waste water is not accumulated there by the environment is protected.<br>
4.	No waste water recycling plant is required.<br>
5.	Water is saved a lot by using Zukleen<br><br>
•	need not pour the water to clean any surface.<br>
•	Waste water recycling plant is not required<br>
•	Quick cleaning<br>
The invention has been explained in relation to specific embodiment. It is inferred that the foregoing description is only illustrative of the present<br><br>
Invention and it is not intended that the invention be limited or restrictive thereto. Many other specific embodiments of the present invention will be apparent to one skilled in the art from the foregoing disclosure. All substitution, alterations and modification of the present invention which come within the scope of the following claims are to which the present invention is readily susceptible without departing from the spirit of the invention.<br>
The scope of the Invention should therefore be determined not with reference to the above description but should be determined with reference to appended claims along with full scope of equivalents to which such clewms are entitled.<br><br><br>
I Claim<br>
1.	A cleaning composition used to clean the surface with very little water<br>
(to wet the cloth) comprising<br>
Phosphoric acid	15% to 20%<br>
Oxalic acid	2% to   5%<br>
Sodium lauryl ethyl sulfonate	10% to 20%<br>
Sodiumlaurylethyloxalate	5% to 10%<br>
Distilled water	68%   45%<br>
2.	A cleaning composition substantially as here in described and<br>
illustrated with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br><br></td>
