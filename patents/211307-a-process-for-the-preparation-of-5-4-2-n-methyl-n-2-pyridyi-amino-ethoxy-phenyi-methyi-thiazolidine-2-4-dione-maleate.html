"A process for the preparation of 5-[4-[2-[N-methyl-N-(2-pyridyl) amino] ethoxy] phenyl methyl] thiazolidine-2,4-dione maleate"<br>
(a)	USV LIMITED<br>
(b)	B.S.D. Marg, Station Road, Govandi, Mumbai - 400 088, Maharashtra, India<br>
(c)	Indian Company incorporated under the Companies Act 1956<br>
The following specification describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
17-3-2005<br><br>
9-7-2004<br><br>
Field of the invention.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 5-[4-[2-[N-methyl-N-(2-pyridyl) amino] ethoxy] phenyl methyl] thiazolidine-2,4-dione] (V) known as rosiglitazone, an antidiabetic compound , which is the drug of choice for non-insulin dependant diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The invention further relates to the novel process of reduction and subsequent purification, which results into substantially pure rosiglitazone and its salts in better yields.<br>
Background and prior art:<br>
US Patent 5,002,953 discloses the process for reducing the 5-[4-[2-[N-methyl-N-(2-pyridyl) amino] ethoxy] benzylidene] thiazolidine-2,4-dione (IV) to 5-[4-[2-[N-methyl-N-2-(pyridyl) amino] ethoxy] phenyl methyl] thiazolidine-2,4-dione (V) by using hydrogen on palladium catalyst in 1,4-dioxane. Such process that involves use of noble metal is always costly. Secondly it has inherent problems of safety as noble metal is used. Yield and poisoning of catalyst are other issues, which make it a secondary choice. WO 99,23095 relates to similar process in glacial acetic acid.<br>
Bio organic Medicinal Chemistry Letters, 1994, Vol. 4, 1181-84 discloses the use of magnesium metal and methanol for reduction of 5-[4-[2-[N-methyl-N-(2-pyridyl) amino] ethoxy] benzylidine] thiazolidine-2,4-dione (IV) to 5-[4-[2-[N-Methyl-N-(2-pyridyl) amino] ethoxy] phenyl methyl] thiazolidine-2,4-dione(V). Use of large quantities of magnesium metal, formation of alkoxide with methanol are inherent drawbacks of this process, which necessitate a better option if available. Other associated drawbacks include uncontrolled evolution of hydrogen and therefore safety issues, removal of magnesium alcoholate from methanol, discoloration etc.<br><br><br>
WO 93/10254 relates to bio-transformation by Rhodotorula Yeast for conversion of 5~[4-[2-[N-rnethyl-N-(2-pyridyl) amino] ethoxy] benzylidine] thiazolidine-2,4-dione (IV) to 5-[4-[2-[N-methyl-N-2-(pyridyl) amino] ethoxy] phenyl methyl] thiazolidine-2,4-dione (V). Such biotransformations always involve lot of capital expenditure and process is highly sensitive and therefore prone for failures. Precise controls and sensitivity being the main drawbacks.<br>
WO 98/ 37073 provides a reduction method using Lithium borohydride/ THF7 Pyridine, NaBH4 / LiCl / Pyridine and Lithium tri-s-butyl borohydride.<br>
US 5002953 and WO 99/23095 disclose reduction of double bond for the preparation of 5-[4-[2-[N-methyl-N-(2-pyridyl) amino] ethoxy] phenyl methyl] thiazolidine-2,4-dione (V). The disclosure has inherent drawbacks. It involves a troublesome step, requires high-pressure hydrogenation using palladium supported on carbon catalyst. In this process high amount of palladium was required which indirectly enhances the cost as well as safety concerns i.e. while handling the catalyst. Also the yield was about 70-80%. In the said process poisoning of catalyst was observed due to thiazolidinedione moiety containing sulphur and hence at times reaction needed longer time for completion.<br>
In case of metal reduction (Reported in Bio. Med. Chem. Lett. 1994, Vol 4, 1181-84) large quantity of magnesium metal is required, as it forms alkoxide with methanol aggravating the work up procedure making it more tedious and cumbersome. Further usage of excess magnesium in methanol causes uncontrolled evolution of hydrogen that can lead to safety hazards. Lastly the removal of magnesium alcoholate of methanol from the 5-[4-[2-[N-methyl-N-(2-pyridyl) amino] ethoxy]phenyl methyl] thiazolidine-2,4-dione (V) is difficult, yielding to lower isolation efficiency and in turn imparts colour to the final product.<br>
WO 98/ 37073 disclosing biotransformation of a 5-[4-[2-[N-methyl-N-(2-pyridyl) amino ethoxyjbenzylidene] thiazolidine-2,4-dione (IV) to its corresponding benzyl derivative was reported by Rhodotorula rubra.. However it is time consuming and difficult to<br><br><br>
implement on the plant scale, requiring highly sophisticated infrastructure to grow the enzyme.<br>
The following cited references relate to use of cobalt chloride and other salts in combination with borohydride and at times with a ligand for reduction of double bonds preferably in α,β unsaturated compounds, alkenes, alkyl halides etc:<br>
Leutenegger U. Leutengga et.al. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 28: 60 (1989) discloses enantioselective reduction of α,β-unsaturated carboxylates with sodium borohydride and catalytic amounts of chiral cobalt semi -corrin complexes. Semi corrins have been appeared to offer ideal prerequisites for the use in enantioselective catalysis with chiral metal complexes. In the presence of catalytic amounts (~ 1%) of the semicorrin complex formed in situ from C0CI2 and the ligand, smooth remarkable uniform reduction to the optically active ester using sodiumborohydride is described. The enantioselectivity have been achieved up to 97%. C0CI2 and Cobalt bis (semi-corrinate) complex can be recovered in good yield by decomplexation with acetic acid.<br>
M. N. Ricroch and A. Gandemer J. Organometal. Chem. 67: 119 (1974) discloses (pyridinalo) cobaloxime , chloro (pyridinalo) cobaloxime and Vitamin B12 catalysing, the hydrogenation of a,p-unsaturated esters by hydrogen or sodium borohydride.<br>
J. O. Oshy et al (J. Amer. Chem. Soc.) 108:67-72 (1986) discloses transition metal (i.e. cobalt) assisted NaBH4 and LiAlH4 reductions for nitriles, alkenes and alkyl halides. The selective reduction of alkenes by NaBH4 -CoCl2 is reported. It is a typical example of heterogeneous catalytic reduction. Other combinations of LiAlH4 with C0Cl2 are reported for reduction of alkyl halide. A radical mechanism involving halide atom or oxidative addition to the aluminide is proposed.<br>
Cantello et. al. J. med. Chem., 1994, 37 3977-3985 has reported the reduction of 5-[[442-[N-Methyl-N-2-(Pyridyl) amino] ethoxy] benzylidine]thiazolidone-2,4-dione to 5-[[4-[2-<br><br>
[N-Methyl-N-2-(Pyridyl)   amino]   ethoxy]   phenyl   methyl]thiazolidone-2,4-dione   in magnesium/methanol via electron transfer. The yield reported is 62%.<br>
Pool et al in WO 94/05659) have described the preparation of maleate in ethanol at reflux temperature.<br>
WO 064892, 1999 relates to recrystallization of maleate salt in ethanol/water mixture at 70°C. Further it claims a novel polymorph using the same solvent.<br>
WO 064893 discloses uses of denatured ethanol (5% methanol) for making a novel maleate salt.<br>
WO 064896 describes the preparation of a novel polymorphic maleate salt in acetone under stream of nitrogen for 17.5 hrs at reflux temp.<br>
In all the above reported inventions, pure maleate salt is obtained using mixture of solvents in 75-90% yield.<br>
Various solvents are being industrially used for various processes that are process specific, product specific. Many a times an attempt to use different class of solvents frustrates the purpose. Such classifications are often being given on the basis of polarity, behavioral characteristics, number of polar positions present in the molecule and so on. Another way to represent the same includes use of dielectric constants values of the solvents. The representative chart of solvents with their dielectric constants is listed in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, by David R. Lide 81st Edition Page 6-149 to 6-171 for reference.<br>
The prior art reported above for the reduction of the benzylidene compound (IV) can be said to have the following not so favorable attributes which if overcome would be of immense industrial advantage:<br><br>
1)	U S patent 5, 002, 953 and WO 99/ 23095 uses palladium, which is very expensive, unsafe and hazardous.<br>
2)	Mg metal in methanol (Reported in Bio.Med. Chem. Lett. 1994, Vol 4, 11 $1-84) has the inherent problem of difficulty to control the reaction during scale up.<br>
3)	Bio transformation requires special infrastructure and<br>
4)	WO 98/ 37073 uses LiBH4, which is extremely expensive<br>
Objects of invention:<br>
1.	The main object of the present invention is to provide a novel and an industrially viable and cost effective process for the preparation of rosiglitazone maleate which obviates the drawbacks of prior art process by use of cheaper and easily available raw-materials.<br>
2.	Another aspect of the invention is to provide 5-[4-[2-[N-methyl-N-(2-pyridyl) amino] ethoxy] phenyl methyl] thiazolidene-2,4-dione (V) in high yield and purity by reduction of 5-[4-[2-[N-methyl-N-2-(pyridyl) amino] ethoxy] benzylidene] thiazolidine-2,4-dione (IV).<br>
3.	Yet another aspect of this invention is to provide purification method for intermediate (IV) and (V) in order to achieve high purity.<br>
4.	Yet another objective of the present invention is to obtain the pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt, viz. rosiglitazone maleate from rosiglitazone base in high yield and<br>
purity using Acetone \ isopropyl alcohol (IPA) mixture.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>

This process employs temperature in the range of 20-45°C and wherein a suitable solvent which is mixture of solvents is used, viz. tetrahydrofuran (THF)/ dimethyl formamide (DMF)/ Water.<br><br><br>
The novel purification route selected gives substantially pure product. Conventionally inorganic metal when loosely bonded to organic substrate, the adduct is called complex. In the present invention ammonia forms a loose adduct with organic substrate, which is referred as complex and be construed accordingly.<br>
Detailed description of the invention:<br>
The present invention offers a novel reduction method, which is more efficient because it is faster, easier and results in substantially improved yield of the desired product. It is also more convenient for scale up at plant, since no high-pressure autoclaves are required. The solvents used for this process are THF, DMF and water by alone or a mixture thereof.<br>
Various solvents with different constitution are used which are process specific, product specific. Hydroxylic solvents are to be construed to mean solvents whose molecular formula has hydroxyl group as electronegative part of molecule<br>
Use of borohydride of alkali metal in the reduction process gives an impressive yield. The yield is high in the range of 90-95%, yielding product with a purity of about 97 % by HPLC.<br>
Alcoholic purification of intermediate (IV) enhances purity of (V) to 97 to 97.5 % by HPLC where as the crude product has purity in the range of 88-90%.<br>
Purification of 5-[4-[2-[N-methyl-N-(2-pyridyl) amino] ethoxy] phenyl methyl] thiazolidine-2,4-dione (V) was accomplished by dissolving it in alcohol at alkaline pH obtained by purging dry ammonia gas. This on subsequent neutralization with acetic acid yielded pure compound purity 99% by HPLC.<br><br><br>
