				<td>Method for preparing a storage stable ivy leaves extract and an extract prepared according<br>
to said method<br>
The present invention relates to a method for preparing a storage-stable ivy leaves extract<br>
using an extracting agent, with the extract at least comprising the constituents hederacoside<br>
C and α-hederin.<br>
Within the meaning of the present invention, the term "storage-stable" means that, whether<br>
it is determined by the natural composition of the extract or whether it is adjusted to the<br>
given value by selective measures, a particular hederacoside C/α-hederin ratio in the<br>
extract remains stable for long periods.<br>
Extracts from ivy leaves are nowadays successfully employed for treating respiratory tract<br>
diseases, in particular, since the extract exhibits spasmolytic, expectorant and<br>
antiobstructive effects. These effects are to be attributed, in particular, to the<br>
therapeutically important ivy leaves extract constituents which belong to the triterpene<br>
saponin class. In this connection, the main saponin is the bidesmosidic hederacoside C and<br>
the α-hederin which is formed from it by by ester hydrolysis. Another saponin which has been<br><br>
detected is hederagenin.<br>
Since ivy leaves extracts can be obtained by a variety of methods, these extracts frequently<br>
exhibit different degrees of efficiency. This stems from the fact that the proportions of the<br>
constituents depend not only on the natural constitution of the ivy leaves but also on the<br>
particular method used for preparing the extract.<br>
In addition to this, the applicant has recently demonstrated that α-hederin, in particular, is<br>
responsible for the spasmolytic effect of ivy leaves extracts since this active compound<br>
binds to P-adrenergic receptors, with this leading, in the smooth musculature of the<br>
bronchial systems, to relaxation by way of further cascades.<br>
A great variety of methods for preparing dry extracts from plant materials have been<br>
described in the field of pharmacy and. in particular in the field of pharmaceutical<br>
preparation.<br>
For example. DE 101 12 168 AI discloses a method lor preparing dry extracts from plant<br>
materials. The method disclosed in this document can allegedly be used to adjust the<br>
content of lipophilic and hydrophilic substances. In this method, the plant material is<br>
subjected to at least two extractions with solvents of differing lipophilicity and the extracts<br>
from these extractions are isolated separately. The extracts are dried separately from each<br>
other and then mixed in the desired ratio. This makes it possible to adjust the content of<br>
lipophilic and hydrophilic substances. The method is allegedly also suitable for obtaining<br>
dry extracts from ivy (Hedera helix).<br>
However, a disadvantage of this method is the circumstance that two separate extractions<br>
have to be carried out. thereby making the method as a whole very elaborate.<br>
In addition. DE 30 25 223 AI discloses a pharmaceutical preparation based on iv\ extracts<br>
and a method for producing it. in which method an ivy extract having a hederasaponin C<br>
content of 60 and. respectively, 90% is obtained using acetone and methanol.<br>
However, the hederacoside C content of the extract which is obtained from this method is<br>
not stable since experience shows that the hederacoside C in the extract is hydrolyzed to<br>
α-hederin.<br>
However, it is frequently necessary to keep the content of the constituents hederacoside C<br>
and α-hederin in ivy extracts stable and thereby storable. Only when stable quantity ratios<br>
are available it is possible, for example, to prepare mixed extracts having precisely<br>
adjusted concentration ratios. Such precisely adjusted concentration ratios make it easier to<br><br>
produce pharmaceuticals which comprise exactly reproducible contents of active<br>
compound and open up the possibility of influencing bioavailability.<br>
It is therefore object of the present invention to provide a method which can be used to<br>
obtain, in only a few steps and without great input, an ivy extract, in particular a dry<br>
extract, in which the content of the constituents hederacoside C and α-hederin is stable<br>
during storage.<br>
According to the initially mentioned method, the object underlying the invention is<br>
achieved bv the method comprising the following steps:<br>
a)	comminuting a quantity of ivy leaves.<br>
b)	steaming the comminuted quantity of ivy leaves with hot water vapor.<br>
c)	extracting by adding the extracting agent, and<br>
d)	where appropriate, drying the extract.<br>
The method according to the invention now makes it possible to obtain an ivy leaves<br>
extract which comprises the constituents hederacoside and α-hederin at a concentration<br>
which is stable during storage. There is no possibility of any undesirable hederacoside<br>
C/a-hederin conversion and consequently of any change in the hederacoside C/α-hederin<br>
ratio in the extract.<br>
In particular, this method makes it possible to prepare an extract which comprises at mo-1<br>
the quantity of α-hederin which is already present in the original drug. Expressed in<br>
another wax. the method results in the isolation of an extract which has a high<br>
hederacoside C content which remains unchanged over relatively long periods. Such<br>
extracts are. for example, of great interest when they are to be used as the starting material<br>
for mixed extracts which comprise a specifically determinable and precisely fixed content<br>
of the active compounds hederacoside C and α-hederin.<br>
In particular, the step of steaming increases the extraction yield of hederacoside C since the<br>
steaming disrupts the cells in the ivy leaves and thereby largely inactivates the enzyme<br>
which catalyzes the conversion of hederacoside C to α-hederin.<br>
Accordingly, extracts having a high content of hederacoside C and a low content of<br>
a-hederin can be obtained by means of the method according to the invention, depending<br><br>
on the original drug employed or depending on the content of active compounds present in<br>
the original drug. The percentage content of a-hederin in the extract which is obtained by<br>
the method according to the invention does not exceed the percentage content within the<br>
leaves which are used. Accordingly, an extract which is, for example, isolated using leaf<br>
batches having a content of less than 0.5% a-hederin itself has a maximum content of<br>
0.5% a-hederin.<br>
Such an extract can then advantageously be used, for example, for selectively preparing<br>
mixtures of extracts each of which comprises precisely determinable quantities of the<br>
particular active compounds, i.e. hederacoside C and a-hederin. with this then resulting in<br>
final extracts which comprise a concretely specified content of the two active compounds.<br>
This step of steaming also opens up the possibility of initially allowing a certain<br>
conversion of hederacoside C into a-hederin and then terminating this conversion.<br>
In the method according to the invention, preference is given to the ivy leaves being used<br>
as the dried drug.<br>
In pharmaceutical production, dried drugs have the advantage that they are sometimes<br>
easier to manipulate, with regard to stability, than are fresh drugs. However, the possibility<br>
of using fresh ivy leaves in the method according to the invention is not excluded.<br>
In the field of pharmaceutical technology, dried medicinal plants and medicinal plant parts<br>
are described bv, definition as being "drugs". In this connection, such medicinal plants,<br>
which are present as "drugs", are used either in unaltered form or in comminuted form.<br>
Preference is furthermore given to comminuting the ivy leaves down to ≤ 5 ≤ 5 mm in<br>
step a).<br>
Preference is furthermore given to the steaming being carried out over a period of from I<br>
to 30 seconds, in particular of from 1 to 10 seconds, and preferably for 5 seconds.<br>
This period proved to be effective for the extraction process since, on the one hand, the<br>
hydrolysis of hederacoside C to a-hederin is prevented and. at the same time, rapid<br>
implementation of the method is ensured.<br>
In this connection, preference is given to the steaming with water vapor taking place at a<br>
temperature of from approx. 90°C (where appropriate under negative pressure) to 140ºC.<br>
in particular at a temperature of from approx. 100 to I20°C. and preferably at 140ºC.<br><br>
Preference is furthermore given, in the method according to the invention, to the extracting<br>
agent being a mixture of alcohol and water components.<br>
Particular preference is given to the alcohol employed being 30% ethanol.<br>
Ethanol is a tried and tested pharmaceutical solvent and is frequently employed as an<br>
extracting agent in the field of pharmaceutical technology. However, it is possible to use<br>
other alcohols, for example propanol, isopropanol. etc.. that is any alcohols which can be<br>
employed as water/alcohol mixtures in connection with extracting for the purpose of<br>
preparing pharmaceuticals.<br>
In addition, preference is given to the extracting in step c) being carried out by means of<br>
preswelling and percolation and, in particular to a period of from approx. 1 hour to approx.<br>
30 hours, preferably a period of 6 hours, being pro\ ided for the preswelling.<br>
Preswelling and percolation are customary methods in the prior art and. in particular, in the<br>
field of preparing pharmaceuticals from plants. An exhaustive extraction of the ivy leaves<br>
can be achieved b&gt; means of the steps of preswelling and percolation.<br>
In this connection, preference is given to maintaining a process temperature of from 10 to<br>
40°C. in particular of 30°C.<br>
Preference is given, in a development of the method according to the invention, to the<br>
drying in step d) being carried out by means of thin film vaporization and subsequent spray<br>
drying.<br>
Both methods are conventional drying methods, with thin film vaporization having proved<br>
to be a mild evaporation method in connection with preparing pharmaceuticals, just like<br>
spray drying, which can be used, as experience shows, to dry liquid preparations to give<br>
pulyerulent final products which are distinguished, in particular, by the fact that they can<br>
be readily mixed once again with water to gi\e ready-to-use preparations. In this<br>
connection, the thin film vaporization is. for example, carried out at from approx. 50 to<br>
60°C and at from 130 to 180 mbar. and the spray drying is carried out at from 45 to 60°C.<br>
Preference is furthermore given to the method according to the invention being used to<br>
prepare an ivy leaves extract having an elevated content of hederacoside C.<br>
As described above. it is possible to use the method according to the invention to<br>
selectively increase the proportion of hederacoside C. with the content of α-hederin in the<br>
extract at the same time corresponding to at most the content of a-hederin in the original<br><br>
drug.<br>
One embodiment provides for at least a part of the hederacoside C being selectively<br>
converted into α-hederin prior to step b). that is the steaming.<br>
This opens up the possibility of selectively preparing (as it were "designing") extracts<br>
having a particular hederacoside C/α-hederin ratio and of only carrying out the steaming<br>
step, which then prevents any further conversion of hederacoside C into a-hederin, after a<br>
particular hederacoside C/a-hederin ratio has been reached.<br>
This is based on the applicant's finding that conversion of hederacoside C into a-hederin<br>
can be brought about by a fermentation step which is catalyzed by water.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to a storage-stable ivy leaves extract which is prepared<br>
using the method according to the invention.<br>
Extracts having a high content of hederacoside are advantageous, for example, when<br>
mixtures composed of extracts which comprise a determinable content of hederacoside are<br>
to be prepared. Even if, as explained above, α-hederin is the active constituent of the ivleaves as far as the bronchospasmolytic effect is concerned, extracts having a high content<br>
of hederacoside C are also advantageous since these extracts can. as mentioned above, be<br>
used for preparing selective mixtures.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to the use of the extract which is prepared in accordance<br>
with the invention, in particular the dry extract, for preparing a pharmaceutical and. in<br>
particular, for preparing a pharmaceutical for treating respiratory tract diseases.<br>
The pharmaceutical according to the invention can accordingly be used for treating<br>
respiratory tract diseases such as infectious and inflammatory respiratory tract diseases,<br>
such as pneumonia, tracheitis, bronchitis etc.. and also in connection with obstructive and<br>
restrictive lung diseases such as chronic bronchitis, bronchial asthma, bronchiectases, etc..<br>
that is in connection with respiratory tract diseases in which relaxation of the weak<br>
musculature is desired.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to a pharmaceutical which comprises an extract which is<br>
prepared using the method according to the invention.<br>
In this connection, the pharmaceutical can be present in the form of capsules, tablets,<br>
coated tablets, suppositories, granules, powders, solutions, creams, emulsions, aerosols.<br><br>
ointments and oils. Oral administration forms arc particularly preferred in this connection.<br>
The pharmaceutical can comprise auxiliary substances which are conventionally used in<br>
pharmaceutical preparation. A number of suitable substances can be found, for example, in<br>
A. Kibbe, Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 3rd Ed.. 2000, American<br>
Pharmaceutical Association and Pharmaceutical Press.<br>
Other advantages ensue from the example and the attached figures. In the/figures<br>
Fig. 1a	shows a graph of the influence of the drug steaming on the constituent<br>
spectrum of the extract<br>
Fig. 1b	shows a graph of the influence of the drug steaming on the extraction yield<br>
of Hedera saponins.<br>
It will be understood that the features which arc mentioned above and which are still to be<br>
explained below can be used not only in the combination which is in each case specified<br>
but also in other combinations, or on their own. without departing from the scope of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Example:	<br>
Preparing dry ivv leaves extracts having an elevated content of hederacoside C<br>
The basis for controlling the ratio of hederacoside C to α-hederin is to selectively<br>
prevent the elimination of the sugar in the C28 position of the hederacoside C<br>
during the extraction process. When selecting the drug batch, care should be taken<br>
10 ensure that leaves batches having a low α-hederin content are used. It is<br>
advisable to specify that the content of a-hederin in the dried drug should be less<br>
man 0.5%.<br>
A homogeneous sample of ivy leaves gave the following analysis with regard to the<br>
content of the two saponins:<br>
hederacoside C:	6.37%<br>
a-hederin:	0.85%<br>
Starting from that drug, in each case three extractions were carried out twice in<br><br>
accordance with the following extraction protocols:<br>
Extraction protocol 1:<br>
3 g of the drug, which had been dried and comminuted down to approx. 3x3 mm,<br>
were steamed with hot water vapor (approx. 100°C) for a few seconds. The drug<br>
which had been treated in this way was preswollen with 18 g of the extracting agent<br>
(30% ethanol (m/m)) for approx. 6 hours. After draining off the miscella. the<br>
remaining drug was percolated with a further 18 g of the extracting agent. This<br>
miscella was dried in a vacuum-drying oven.<br>
The extraction temperature is preferably between approx. 20 and approx. 40°C. in<br>
particular approx. 30°C. The ratio of drug to the extracting agent is. for example,<br>
1:12.<br>
Alternative!y the drying can be carried out, for example, by means of thin film<br>
vaporization at. for example. 55°C and 150 mbar and then spray drying at 45-60ºC.<br><br>
Extraction protocol 2:<br>
The extraction protocol corresponds to extraction protocol 1 with the exception of<br>
the procedural step of steaming.<br>
After the resulting extracts have been analyzed, it was possible to document the<br>
results listed in table 1 below.<br><br>
In Figs. 1a and 1b, the results are explained by the two diagrams. The figures show<br>
clearly that there is a higher content of hederacoside C and a lower content of<br>
α-hederin in the extract prepared in accordance with extraction protocol I (with the<br>
steaming step) than in the extract which was prepared using a conventional method<br>
(without the steaming step) (see Fig. 1a).<br>
At the same time, it was possible to increase the extraction yield by using extraction<br>
protocol I (with the steaming step) as compared with using extraction protocol 2<br>
(without the steaming step) (see Fig. 1b).<br>
The dry leaves extract which was prepared in accordance with this protocol<br>
therefore comprised the quantity of a-hederin which was maximally present in the<br>
leaves which were used. Therefore, extracts containing a high content of<br>
hederacoside C and a very low content of a-hederin were obtained. When leaves<br><br>
batches having a content of α-hederin of less than 0.5% are used, it can also be<br>
assumed that the resulting extract has a maximum content of 0.5% α-hederin.<br>
It is consequently possible, by selectively fixing different hederacoside-enriched<br>
extracts, to obtain an extract which is characterized by a specified content of<br>
hederacoside C and a maximum content or 0.5% a-hederin.<br>
These dry extracts were stoned and the hederacoside C/a-hederin ratio was<br>
determined once again after 3,6 and 9 moths. No significant change in the ratio<br>
was found in this connection.<br>
These stored extracts can be used without problems in connection with<br>
subsequent formulation to produce pharmaceuticals. Any undesirable conversion<br>
of hederacoside C into a-hederin can be ruled out, which means that it is<br>
possible to produce pharmaceuticals having a defined hederacoside C/α-hederin<br>
ratio in a selective and reproducible manner.<br>
