				<td>The present invention relates to a thermosetting resin composition suitable for producing moulded articles suitable for electric and electronic appliances.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a thermosetting resin composition excellent particularly in flame retardancy, heat resistance and water resistance for electric and electronic devices. Further, the present invention also relates to molded articles formed by curing such a resin composition, particularly to sealing, coating or insulation of a part, a laminated board and a metal-clad laminated board for electric and electronic devices, such as a sealed molded article, a prepreg, a multi-layered circuit substrate and a laminated board for a circuit substrate.<br>
A semiconductor device and an integrated circuit device are sealed with various sealing materials for preventing influences caused by external vibrations, impact, dust, water and ambient gas. While a metal material, ceramic, glass, etc., have been used as sealing materials, a thermosetting resin is recently used for the sealing in most cases from the viewpoint of a cost and mass-productivity.<br>
With technological innovation in the field of semiconductors, the integration degree has increased, devices have decreased in size and wirings have come be finer and finer. Packages tend to decrease in size and thickness as well, and sealing materials are accordingly required to have high reliability. Further, the sealing materials are required to have strength and thermal conductivity, and it is general practice to use resins containing inorganic fillers.<br>
-2-<br><br><br>
Thermosetting resins typified by an epoxy resin are excellent in mechanical strength, electrical properties, thermal properties, adhesion, chemical durability and water resistance, so that they are applied to various 5  laminated boards formed in combination with glass, cloth, paper or synthetic fibers, such as a laminated board for a structure, a laminated board for heavy electric machines and equipment, a printed wiring board and a laminated metal board for a printed wiring board.<br>
10      These electric and electronic parts are decreasing in size and thickness and have come to have high performances due to technological innovation. Therefore, it is required to decrease the size and thickness of semiconductor devices constituting the electric and<br>
15  electronic parts and multi-layered printed wiring boards on which such parts are to be mounted, and they are required to attain high performances and to have high reliability.<br>
For the above reason, the mounting method of a<br>
20  multi-layered printed wiring board is shifting from a pin-insertion type package to a surface-mounting type package and further to a bare chip mounting method in which a chip is directly mounted, so that a high adhesion of a resin is required. The high adhesion of a<br>
25  resin can be attained by decreasing water absorption of the resin. A laminated board for a circuit board is processed under high-temperature and high-humidity conditions during the fabrication of the laminated board and mounting of electronic parts and then subjected to<br>
30  the step of soldering by dipping it in a soldering bath, so that the laminated board is liable to undergo swelling or peeling. Therefore, the resin is required to have high heat resistance, high flame retardancy and long-term stability.<br>
3<br><br>
The above thermosetting resin used for sealing semiconductor devices or in the printed wiring board or laminated board (to be generally sometimes referred to as "electronic part" hereinafter) is required to have 5  high flame retardancy, and for this purpose, it is<br>
general practice to employ a method in which a bromine-containing epoxy resin and antimony oxide are incorporated into the resin. However, this method causes a problem that hydrogen bromide, bromine-containing gas,<br>
10  antimony bromide, etc., are generated during combustion to do harm to human bodies and corrode a machine and equipment, and also causes an environmental safety problem on disposal of industrial wastes resulting from the process of producing electronic parts and disposal<br>
15  of an epoxy resin molding material and electronic parts produced from such a molding material.<br>
Further, when an electronic part made of a resin containing the above flame retardant is left at high temperatures for a long period of time, an aluminum<br>
20  wiring on a semiconductor device is corroded under the influence of free bromine, which causes malfunctioning of the electronic part and causes a problem that the reliability at high temperatures is degraded. For overcoming the above problems, there has been proposed a<br>
25  method in which a metal hydroxide is added as a flame retardant.<br>
In the above method, however, it is required to incorporate a large amount of the metal hydroxide (at least 40 % by weight). Further, electronic parts are<br>
30  exposed to a high temperature (generally, 215 to 260oC), and there is caused a problem that the metal hydroxide having a high water absorptivity causes the swelling or cracking of a semiconductor device due to sharp gasification of water absorbed into the metal hydroxide.<br>
4<br><br>
Further, there is caused another problem that the metal hydroxide decreases the soldering resistance. There is still another problem that the function of an electronic part decreases under a high-temperature and high-5  humidity environment having a temperature of 80 to 200°C and a relative humidity of 70 to 100 %.<br>
For overcoming the above problem, JP-A-9-176368 proposes a composition, in which the metal hydroxide is limited to magnesium hydroxide and the magnesium<br>
10  hydroxide is surface-treated to prevent water absorption and improve its dispersibility in a resin.<br>
According to technological innovation in the field of electronic parts in recent years, however, it is required to attain higher flame retardancy, higher<br>
15  humidity resistance and higher safety. Further, when magnesium hydroxide particles have a high content of impurities, such as an Fe compound and Mn compound in particular, they cause a resin to thermally deteriorate. Further, an accumulated charge amount decreases due to a<br>
20  recent increase in the memory capacity, that is, an increase in integration degree of a memory. When the content of radioactive substances such as uranium (U), thorium (Th), etc., is large, therefore, there is caused a problem that the memory suffers a soft error due to a-<br>
25  ray generated by disintegration of U, Th, etc. For example, the content of U and Th in a 1 M to 4 M bit memory is required to be 1 ppb (ng/g) or less, and the content of U and Th in a 4 to 16 M bit memory is required to be 0.1 ppb (ng/g) or less, for ensuring<br>
30  reliability against the soft error. When a synthetic resin is to be used as a sealing material, therefore, the content of the radioactive substances in magnesium hydroxide to be incorporated into the synthetic resin comes to be required to be very small, that is, the<br><br>
radiation of a-ray from the synthetic resin is required to be low.<br>
It has been also found that a water-soluble alkali metal salt in magnesium hydroxide particles affects 5  water resistance and insulation.<br>
According to studies made by the present inventors, it has been accordingly found that, when a predetermined amount of high-purity magnesium hydroxide particles containing an Fe compound, Mn compound, U compound and<br>
10  Th compound as impurities in amounts equivalent to, or Smaller than, predetermined amount and having an average secondary particle diameter of 5 µm or less and a specific surface area (BET) of 10 m2/g or less and, optionally, a predetermined amount of other inorganic<br>
15  filler are incorporated into a synthetic resin, there<br>
can be obtained a resin composition for electronic parts and a molded article, the resin composition having sufficient water resistance under high-temperature and high-humidity conditions, having anti-corrosion<br>
20  properties for a mold and an electronic part, being excellent in in flame retardancy and thermal conductivity and serving to prevent the occurrence of a soft error of a memory.<br>
The present invention has been made on the basis of<br>
25  the above finding. That is, according to the present invention, there is provided a thermosetting resin composition for electric and electronic machines and equipment, comprising (a) a thermosetting resin and (b) magnesium hydroxide particles, the magnesium hydroxide<br>
30  particles satisfying the following requirements (i) to (iv),<br>
(i) the average secondary particle diameter, measured by a laser diffraction scattering method, is 0.5 to 5 µm.<br><br>
(ii) the BET specific surface area is 0.1 to 10 m2/g, (iii) the total content of an Fe compound and an Mn compound as metals is 0.02 % by weight or less, and (iv) the total content of a U compound and a Th 5  compound as metals is 10 ppb or less.<br>
The present invention will be explained more in detail hereinafter.<br>
Magnesium hydroxide particles not only causes the thermal conductivity to decrease but also causes the 10  thermal stability of an incorporated resin to greatly decrease with—an increase in the content of an iron compound and a manganese compound in the magnesium hydroxide. However, it does not mean that the physical properties of the resin are not impaired so long as the 15  total content of these compounds satisfies the above range. It is also required that the above average secondary particle diameter and the above specific surface area should satisfy the above ranges, respectively. With an increase in the average secondary 20  particle diameter of the particles, the area of contact to the resin decreases, and the thermal stability improves. However, there is caused a problem that the mechanical strength decreases or that the appearance is poor. The average secondary particle diameter of the 25  magnesium hydroxide is 0.5 to 5 µm, preferably 0.7 to 3 µm.<br>
The BET specific surface area of the magnesium hydroxide particles is 0.1 to 10 m2/g, preferably 0.2 to 5 m2/g. Further, the total content of a U compound and a 30  Th compound as metals is required to satisfy 10 ppb or less, preferably 5 ppb or less, more preferably 1 ppb or less. Further, desirably, the content of a water-soluble alkali metal salt is 0.05 % by weight or less, preferably 0.03 % by weight, more preferably 0.003 % by<br>
7<br><br>
weight or less.<br>
An Fe compound and an Mn compound have an influence on the thermal deterioration of the resin when the content thereof exceeds the above upper limit. Further, 5  when the content of an U compound and a Th compound is within the above range, the occurrence of a soft error of a memory can be decreased, and with an increase in the content thereof, the frequency of a soft error increases.<br>
10      As described above, magnesium hydroxide particles can give a resin composition that satisfies various properties such as compatibility with a resin, dispersibility, moldability, processability, an appearance, mechanical strength and flame retardancy of<br>
15  a molded article and a decrease in the occurrence of soft errors of a memory, so long as the average secondary particle diameter, the specific surface area, the total content of an iron compound and a manganese compound, the total content of a U compound and Th<br>
20  compound and, desirably, the content of a water-soluble alkali metal salt are within the above ranges.<br>
The method of preparation of the above magnesium hydroxide particles in the present invention is not specially limited so long as the magnesium hydroxide<br>
25  particles satisfy the above requirements (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv).<br>
The magnesium hydroxide particles that satisfy the above (i) average secondary particle diameter and the above (ii) specific surface area can be prepared, for<br>
30  example, by employing basically the method and<br>
conditions described in JP-A-52-115799. That is, the magnesium hydroxide particles can be prepared by providing, as raw materials, magnesium chloride or magnesium nitrate and an alkali substance such as an<br>
8<br><br>
alkali metal hydroxide, ammonia, magnesium oxide or the like and heating them in an aqueous medium under pressure conditions (preferably 5 to 30 kg/cm2) .  In this case, raw materials containing no or little impurities, 5  particularly, such as an iron compound, a manganese compound (and the other above metal compound if necessary), U and Th compounds, etc., are selected, whereby there can be obtained magnesium hydroxide particles that satisfy the above requirements (iii) and<br>
10  (iv). Further, as apparatuses such as a reactor, a purifier, a crystallizer, a dryer, a milling machine, etc., it is required to select apparatuses made of an anti-corrosive material free of elution and inclusion of the above metals.<br>
15      Preferably, the magnesium chloride or magnesium<br>
nitrate and the above alkali substance as raw materials are purified for decreasing the content of the above impurities therein as required.<br>
The water-soluble alkali metal salt can be removed<br>
20  by washing the thus-obtained magnesium hydroxide<br>
particles with ion-exchanged water or industrial water.<br>
The present inventors have made studies for a method of removing U and Th, and as a result, it has been found that it is proper to employ a method in which U in the<br>
25  raw materials for magnesium hydroxide is removed by<br>
adsorption with a hydrotalcite of the following formula<br>
(1),<br>
Mg2+1-xM3+x(OH)2A2-x/2-mH20	(1)<br>
wherein M3+  is  at  least  one of Al3+  and Fe3+,<br>
30	x is  a positive  number of  0.2 
A2"  is  at  least  one  of  C032"  and S042",   and<br>
m is  a number of  0  to  2.<br>
The above hydrotalcite may be a natural product or a synthetic product, and more preferably, it is added to<br>
9<br><br>
the raw materials for magnesium hydroxide, to remove a U compound. There may be employed a method in which a hydrotalcite is synthesized from a magnesium source that is a raw material for magnesium hydroxide and an 5  aluminum source, the synthesized hydrotalcite is<br>
filtered, and a magnesium chloride that is a filtrate is used as a raw material for magnesium hydroxide. In this case, the synthesized hydrotalcite has already adsorbed a U compound, so that magnesium chloride containing<br>
10  little U compound can be obtained. One example is as follows.<br>
2 Liters of a bittern (MgCl2 = 1.9 mol/L) (having a U content of 126 ppb) was placed in a 3-liter beaker, and 2 ml of hydrochloric acid (supplied by Wako<br>
15  Purechemical K.K.) having a concentration adjusted to 5 N was added with stirring. The mixture was stirred at room temperature (25°C) for 30 minutes, to give a bittern having a pH of 1.6. To this bittern was added 20 ml of an aluminum nitrate (supplied by Wako Purechemical<br>
20  K.K.) aqueous solution having a concentration adjusted to 54 g/L with stirring, and further, 23 ml of aqueous ammonia (supplied by Wako Purechemical K.K.) having a concentration of 14 % by weight was dropwise added with stirring. Then, the mixture was stirred at room<br>
25  temperature (25°C) for 30 minutes, to give a bittern having a pH of 6.5.<br>
The above bittern is a suspension containing a double hydroxide formed by co-precipitation of aluminum ion and part of magnesium ion. The above bittern was<br>
30 filtration by means of suction with a Buchner funnel, to give a bittern of magnesium chloride (MgCl2) = 1.7 mol/L as a filtrate.<br>
The content of U was 0.8 ng/ml or less. The above magnesium chloride was used as a Mg source,<br>
10<br><br>
calcium hydroxide was used as an alkali source, and these were reacted, to give magnesium hydroxide. The magnesium hydroxide had a U content of 2 ppb. The above U removing treatment can also remove Th at the same time. 5      The above U content was compared with the U content of magnesium hydroxide obtained by reacting magnesium chloride that was not subjected to U removing treatment with calcium hydroxide.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
The mechanism of removing uranium and thorium is not clear. However, it is assumed that magnesium hydroxide particles undergo crystal growth, so that the BET<br>
15  specific surface area decreases and that the particles are improved in dispersibility, whereby the particles are imparted with power properties suitable as an additive for a resin.<br>
The magnesium hydroxide particles for use in the<br>

20      For forming a solder resist in the process of<br>
fabricating a printed wiring board, a photo-printing method is employed, and it is recent practice to carry out double-side simultaneous exposure. A composite laminated board is therefore required to transmit no<br>
25  ultraviolet light, for complying with the double-side simultaneous exposure.<br>
As an ultraviolet-non-transmitting laminated board, there are known a laminated board using a matrix resin containing an ultraviolet absorbent and a laminated<br>
30  board using a glass fiber substrate to which an<br>
ultraviolet shielding agent is adhered. An organic ultraviolet shielding agent to be incorporated into the matrix resin is selected from organic ultraviolet absorbents such as hydroxybenzophenones,<br><br>

An inorganic ultraviolet shielding agent is selected,<br>
10  for example, from ZnxAl203+x (x = 1 to 10), titanium oxide, clay or calcium carbonate. These may be used in combination.<br>
The content of the ultraviolet absorbent or the ultraviolet shielding agent based on the resin<br>
15  composition is preferably 0.001 to 2 % by weight. When the above content is less than 0.001 % by weight, there is no or little effect. When it exceeds 2 % by weight, discoloration takes place under heat.<br>
The resin composition of the present invention may<br>
20  contain a mold release agent such as a curing natural wax, a synthetic wax, a higher fatty acid, a metal salt thereof or paraffin; a colorant such as carbon black, a pigment, a foaming agent, a plasticizer, a filler, an acid receptor, a reinforcing agent, an antioxidant, an<br>

melt-kneading components by a known kneading method using, for example, a kneader, a roll single-screw or twin-screw extruder or a co-kneader.<br>
The resin composition of the present invention is 5 generally used in the form of a powder or tablets when it is molded into an electronic part. For example, as a method of molding the resin composition for forming an electronic part in which a semiconductor is fixed on a substrate, generally, there is employed a low-pressure<br>
10  transfer molding method, and an injection molding method and a compression molding method may be also used. As molding conditions, for example, the resin composition is molded at a molding temperature of 150°C to 200°C, under a pressure of 5 to 15 MPa for a molding time<br>
15  period of 30 to 300 seconds, and a cured product of the resin composition is formed, whereby a sealed-semiconductor molded product is produced. Further, the above molded product may be additionally heat-treated at 100 to 200°C for 2 to 15 hours as required.<br>
