derivatives of the compound are also claimed, but there is no specific mention of the N-[2-ydroxy-3-(1-piperidinyl)-propoxy]-pyridine-1-oxide-3-carboximidoyl -ehioride, end itspreparation process is not described either.<br>
N-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-piperidinyl)-propoxy]-pyridine-1-oxide-3-carboximidoyl chloride is disclosed and claimed as a novel compound in WO 00/50403, and its production process is described there as well. The compound Is produced by the     oxidation    of    the     N-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-plperidinyl)-propoxy]-pyridine-3-carboximidoyl chioride. In the course of oxidation with peracids, the bis-N-oxide derivative oxidized on the N-atoms of both the piperidine ring and the pyridine ring, or the piperidine-N-oxide derivative are formed preferentially, and therefore the oxidation with peracid must be performed in the presence of a strong acid to ensure the dominance of the formation of the pyridine-N-oxide derivative in the course of the oxidation process. The yield of this process, however, is not satisfactory.   The   optically   active   enantiomers   of  the   N-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-plperidinyl)-propoxyI-pyridine-1-oxide-3-carboximid-oyl     chloride     are     also described in WO 00/50403. They are prepared in a way similar to the preparation of the raceme compound using the suitable optically active starting substances.<br>
Considering the fact that the N-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-piperidinyl)-propoxy]-pyridine-1-oxide-3-carboximidoyl chloride and its optically active enantiomers are not only useful in the treatment of diabetic complications, primarily retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy, but simultaneously reduce chronic insulin resistance, these compounds are valuable active Ingredients in pharmaceutical products. However, in order for these compounds to be useful<br><br>
3<br>
 in the pharmaceutical  industry,  an easier process is necessary for their production.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
We have found that N-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-plperidinyl)-propoxy]-pyridine-1-oxide-3-carboxamidine of formula (I), which is a new compound, is useful as intermediate for making possible the simple production of N-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-piperidinyl)-propoxy)-pyridine-1-oxide-3-carboximidoyl chloride in high purity and in a high yield.<br>
Based on this observation, the present invention relates to the N-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-piperidinyI)-propoxy]-pyridine-1-oxide-3-carboxamidine. and its acid addition salts. The invention also rotates to the optically active enantiomers of the aforementioned compound, the (R)-(-)-N-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-piperidinyl)-propoxy]-pyridine-1-oxide-3-carboxamidine and the (S)-(+)-N-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-plperidinyl]-propoxy]-pyridine-1-oxide-3-carboxamidine, and the acid addition salts of these compounds.<br>
Hereafter, "optically active enantiomer" refers to a compound whose optical purity is at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, most preferably at least 86%, that is, the compound contains at least this mass ratio of the specified optically active enantiomer. "Acid addition salts" refers to salts produced from the compounds with mineral or organic salts, by the known process.<br>
As mentioned above, the compounds of the invention may be used as intermediates in the production of N-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-piperidinyl)-propoxy]-pyridine-1-oxide-3-carboximidoyl chloride. Therefore, the Invention relates to the<br><br>
4<br>
 use of N-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-pIperidinyl)-propoxy]-pyrldlne-1-oxide-3-carboxamldine and its optically active enantiomers in the preparation of N-[2-hydraxy-3-(1--plperidinyl)-propoxy]-pyridine-1-oxid-3-carboximidoyl-chloride-and-its-optically-active enantiomers.<br>
The compound N-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-plperidinyl)-propoxy]-pyridine-1-oxide-3-carbox-amidine of the invention is preferably prepared by the following method.<br>
3-cyano-pyridine is used as a starting compound, and the 3-cyano-pyridlne-1-oxide of formula (II), which fs known from the literature [J. Chem. Soc. 3680 (1959)], can be produced by oxidation. A peracld Is used as oxidant preferably m-chloro-perbenzoic acid. The thus obtained product may be purified by orystalization, but the raw product may also be used in the next step of the synthesis.<br>
By reacting the 3-cyano-pyridine-1-oxide of formula (II) wtth hydroxyfamine, 3-pyridine-amidoxim-1-oxide of formula (III) is produced. The reaction is performed in a suitable aqueous solution, at room temperature, by reacting 3-cyano-pyridine-1-oxide with hydroxylamine, added in excess and liberated in water in situ from its hydrochloride salt with sodium bicarbonate. The product precipitates, therefore it can easily be isolated and purified by crystallization.<br>
N-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-plperidinyl)-propoxy]-pyridine-1-oxide-3-carboxamidine of formula (I) is prepared from the 3-pyrldine-amidoxim-1-oxide of formula (lll), by reacting the compound with a reactive 3-(1-plperidino)-2-hydroxy-propane derivative. As reagent a 1-halo- or 1,2-epoxy-derivative may be used, but<br><br>
5<br>
 preferably a cyclic derivative, a halide of 2-hydroxy-4-azoniaspiro[3,5]nonane should be used as reagent. The most preferable reagent Is the 2-hydroxy-4--azoniaspiro[3-5]nonane-chloride-of-formula (IV). The reaction is performed in an<br>
alkaline medium, using a suitable alcohol, preferably an alkanol of 1-3 carbon atoms, mora preferably ethanol as solvent The reagents may be added In any order. Preferably, the reactive 3-(1-piperidino)-2-hydroxy-propane derivative is applied in a slight excess. The reaction is performed at an elevated temperature, preferably at the boiling-point of the solvent<br>
The thus obtained compound of formula (I) is either isolated as a base and used as Intermediate in the preparation of the biologically effective N-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-piperidinyl)-propoxy]-pyridine-1-oxide-3-carboximidoyl chloride, or the compound is transformed into an acid addition salt with a mineral or organic acid. Thus mono or dihydrochloride, maleate, or any other acid addition salt may be prepared which are suitable. for the use of the compound as Intermediate in the preparation of the above mentioned end product However, it is not necessary to isolate the N-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-plperidinyl)-propoxy]-pyridine-1-oxide-3-carboxamidine to be used as Intermediate. The next step in the synthesis of N-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-piperidinyl)-propoxy]-pyridine-1-oxide-3-carboximidoyl chloride may be performed without the isolation of the compound of formula (I) as well.<br>
When preparing of an optically active product is desired, the compound of formula (I), prior to the transformation, can be resolved by reacting it with an optically active acid suitable for the formation of a dlastereomer salt pair, by the well known methods of resolution. When the salt of the required optical purity is<br><br>
6<br>
 obtained, the optically active base may ba liberated from it. Thereafter, if needed, an add addition salt may be produced from the base with a mineral or organio-acid Either the base or the salt may then be used for the next step of the process of the invention.<br>
According   to   the   Invention,   N-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-plperidinyl)-propoxy]-pyridine-1-oxide-3-carboxamidine  of formula  (I)   is  transformed   into   N-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-piperidinyl)-propoxy]-pyridine-1-oxide-3-carboximidoyl chloride by dlazotation in the presence of hydrochloric acid. The diazotation is performed by the usual method, at a temperature of between -5"C and 0oC, with the slow addition of an alkali-nitrlte, preferably of sodium-nitrite. In the presence of hydrochloric  add,  the  thus obtained  diazonium salt decomposes  at  the temperature of the dlazotation  into N-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-plperidinyl)-propoxy]-pyridine-1-oxide-3-carboximidoyl chloride of formula (V). Then the reaction mixture is aikalified, while cooling, and the product Is isolated in the form of a base by the usual method. The obtained base may be further purified if needed, or transformed into an acid addition salt with a mineral or organic acid. Preferably, maleate or citrate is formed from the compound of formula (V). but It may   also   be   transformed   into   hydrochloride,   dihydrochloride   or   any pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt<br>
The required optically active enantiomers of the N-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-piperidirryl)-propoxy]-pyridine-1-oxide-3-carboximidoyl chloride of formula (V) prepared by diazotation are prepared by resolution from the raceme compound. The resolution is again performed by the formation of a dlastereomer salt pair.<br><br>
7<br>
 preferably with dibenzoyl-tartaric acid, using its suitable optically active form for the salt formation.<br>
if-the-above-described -dlazotation of N [2-hydroxy-3-(1-piperidinyl)-propoxy]-pyridine-1-oxide-3-carboxamidine of formula (I) is performed on an optically active enaritiomer, the enantiomer of the N-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-plperidinyl)-propoxy]-pyridine-1-oxide-3-carboximldoyl chloride of formula (V) of opposite rotation is formed, of satisfactory optical purity. Therefore, according to another version of the process of the Invention, the optically active N-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-plperidllnyl)-propoxy]-pyridine-1-oxide-3-carboximidoyl chloride of formula (V) is prepared  by performing the above described diazotation on the suitable optically active enantiomer of N-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-piperidinyl)-propoxy]-pyridine-1-oxide-3-carboxamidine of formula (I). The thus obtained base may be further purified rf needed, or an acid addition salt may be formed with a mineral or organic acid.<br>
The advantage of the invention is that by the use of the compound of formula (I) of the invention as intermediate, it makes possible the production of highly pure N-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-piperidinyl)-propoxy]-pyridlne-1-oxide-3-carboximidoyl chloride, which has valuable biological effects. Contrary to the process described in WO 00/50403 mentioned in the Introduction, in which this compound is prepared by the oxidation of N-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-piperidinyl)-propoxy]-pyridine-3-carboximidoyi chloride, in this current process the appearance of the products of competitive reactions need not be taken into account By the process of the invention, the base form of N-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-piperidinyl)-propoxyJ-pyridine-1-oxide-3-carboximidoyl chloride is obtained in<br><br>
8<br>
high purity. Up to this point, this was only possible by lengthy purification, or by liberation of the base from the maleate salt.<br>
A further advantaga of the invention is that the N [2-hydroxy-3-(1-plperidinyl)-propoxy]-pyrldine-1-oxide-3-carboxamldine may be produced by the merge of the steps described above and Illustrated in the following examples In greater detail, without the isolation and/or purification of each intermediate product, still obtaining satisfactory purity. This way, the production of the intermediate N-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-piperidinyl)-propoxy]-pyridine-1-oxide-3-carboxamidine becomes possible in the circumstances of pharmaceutical production, which makes possible the Industrial production of the biologically effective N-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-plperidlnyl)-propoxy]-pyridine-1-oxide-3-carboximidoyl chloride.<br>
