PROCESS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF a,a-BRANCHED CARBOXYLIC<br>
ACIDS<br>
The invention relates to a process for the manufacture of quaternary carboxylic acids. More in particular the invention relates to a process for the manufacture of a,oc-branched carboxylic acids from .linear olefins having from 2 to 5 carbon atoms by means of a Koch synthesis using carbon monoxide as reagent and a solid acid catalyst.<br>
Processes for the preparation of a,a-branched carboxylic acids from branched olefins by means of a Koch synthesis, using carbon monooxide and water, were known.<br>
In particular from International Application WO 96/20154 was known a process for the production of trialkylacetic acids from branched olefins and carbon monoxide in a non-aqueous reaction system using a solid resin catalyst comprising a cationic resin, having sufficient acid groups to provide requisite protons for conversion of branched olefin and carbon monoxide to trialkylacetic acids.<br>
In particular the cationic resin was specified to have an acidity of at least equivalent to that of a 65 wt% sulphuric acid.<br>
It will be appreciated by an average person skilled in the art that said process can only be performed in two steps, i.e. one step comprising contacting the solid catalyst with olefin/CO feed and a subsequent step contacting the catalyst with water feed, and that stoichiometric amounts of branched olefin and water will not lead to the desired products in an acceptable yield. Moreover, said process cannot produce more than 1 mole of converted<br><br>
olefin per mole active proton on the solid catalyst in<br>
one cycle of two steps.<br>
On the other hand from WO 92/18592 was known a<br>
process for the manufacture of trialkylacetic acids and<br>
particularly of pivalic acid, from branched olefins and<br>
particularly isobutene, and Carbon monoxide, using a .<br>
solid acid catalyst together with minor amounts of a<br>
Lewis acid, such as boron trifluoride.<br>
In addition, from EP-A-0249976 was known a process<br>
for the manufacture of branched carboxylic acids, by<br>
catalytic conversion of olefins with carbon monoxide and water in the presence of zeolites as catalysts at<br>
temperatures of from 200 to 500 °C and at pressures of 200 to 700 bar.<br>
More in particular zeolites of the pentasil type are used as catalysts. According to the exemplified embodiments only high temperatures (300 °C) and pressures<br>
(300-500 bar) are used.<br>
It will be appreciated that said disclosed reaction conditions will give rise to higher operation costs due to required measures as to safety and environment.<br>
An object of the present invention is providing a further improved, efficient one step manufacturing process for oc,a-branched carboxylic acids, which process starts from lower linear olefins containing from 2 to 5 carbon atoms, and which uses a catalyst system under relatively mild conditions on the one hand and which shows economically acceptable conversion and economically acceptable selectivity to <x carboxylic acids on the other hand.></x>
As a result of extensive research and experimentation there has now been surprisingly found a one step process for manufacture of a,a-branched carboxylic acids from linear olefins by means of reaction with carbon monoxide<br><br>
and an acid, catalyst, characterized in that a linear olefin containing from 2 to 5 carbon atoms, or a precursor thereof, is reacted in a batch reactor or a continuous reactor with carbon monoxide and water, in the presence of an acidic catalyst, having sufficient acid groups to provide requisite protons for the formation of Koch acids and in the presence of a polar non-coordinating organic solvent.<br>
More in particular the invention relates to an improved manufacturing process of trialkylacetic acids of the formula<br><br>
wherein each symbol R represents a radical having 1 to 10 carbon atoms.<br>
More preferably the total number of carbon atoms in the trialkylacetic acids ranges from 5 to 11 and most preferably from 9 to 11 carbon atoms.<br>
With the term "linear olefin or a precursor thereof" as used throughout the present specification is meant that the specified linear olefin itself as well as alcohols, esters or ethers, from which the specific olefin can be easily derived, can be used as starting materials for the present manufacturing process, which makes this process much more flexible than conventional prior art processes -<br>
An important advantage of the present process is that it can be operated as  one step or one reactor process showing an economically acceptable combination of conversion degree and selectivity and starting from cheap<br><br>
lower linear olefins which have surprisingly found to dimerize Before the actual Koch synthesis step.<br>
The catalyst to be used for the process of the present invention can be in general a strong acid catalyst which is known to efficiently catalyze the Koch synthesis, such as homogeneous H2O/BF3 catalyst,<br>
H2O/BF3/H3PO4 catalyst, or concentrated sulfuric acid or<br>
sulfonic acid catalysts, such as paratoluene sulfonic acid, methane sulfonic acid, trifluoromethane sulfonic acid, or a heterogeneous acidic solid catalyst. Homogeneous H2O/BF3/H3PO4 catalyst or methane sulfonic<br>
acid catalyst or a heterogeneous acidic catalyst are preferred.<br>
More preferably a solid acidic ion exchanger showing strong acid behaviour is used. It is preferably selected from the group consisting of sulfonated resins and more preferably sulfonated copolymers of styrene and divinylbenzene, copolymers of vinylnaphthalene and divinylbenzene, copolymers of styrene and methacrylic acid resins, phenolic based resins, sulfonated poly (tetrafluoroethylene) and sulfonated siloxane polymers and sulfonated cellulose derivatives.<br>
In either case of the presence of active sulfonic acid groups, the resin is treated to give a sulfonic acid cation-exchange resin capable of providing sufficient protons, i.e. the resin having an acid strength equivalent to at least 65 wt% sulphuric acid and preferably to at least 70 wt% sulphuric acid.<br>
Catalyst solid resins, comprising sulfonic acid groups and derived from copolymers from styrene-divinyl-benzene, copolymers from vinylnaphthalene-divinyl benzene or derived from (tetrafluoroethylene)polymers or from siloxane polymers are preferred.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
C10+ acids, upon excluding the VERSATIC 11 acid used as<br>
solvent.<br>
Example 2 with isopropanol and heterogeneous catalyst<br>
AMBERLYST 38 was dried overnight in an oven at 100 °C and a sample of 15 g dry AMBERLYST was loaded in a 250 ml autoclave together with 82 ml sulfolane solvent and 50 bar CO The autoclave was then heated up to 150 °C under stationary CO gas cap and constant flow of 0.73 ml/h (9.5 mmol/h) isopropanol. After 65 h operation under these conditions the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature, depressurized and unloaded.<br>
The reaction product was analyzed as described in ex. 1. The total product mixture contained some 12 C% carboxylic acids, the small amount being due to lack of sufficient amount of CO in this run. The extracted acid fraction contained 26 C% of C7 acids, calculated as free<br>
from solvent, corresponding to the dimer, with 34 C% of C5-6 acids and 49 C% of Cg+ acid, upon excluding the<br>
sulfolane used as solvent.<br>
Example 3 with 1-pentanol and heterogenous catalyst<br>
AMBERLYST 38 was dried overnight in an oven at 100 °C and a sample of 15 g dry AMBERLYST was loaded in a 250 ml autoclave together with 66 ml sulfolane solvent and 50 bar CO. The autoclave was then heated up to 170 °C under stationary CO gas cap and constant flow of 2.3 ml/h (21 mmol/h) 1-pentanol. After 16h operation under these conditions the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature, depressurized and unloaded.<br>
The reaction product was analyzed as described in ex. 1. The total product mixture contained some 10 C% carboxylic acids calculated as free from solvent, the small amount being due to lack of sufficient amount of CO in this run. The extracted acid fraction contained 28 C% of Cn  acids, corresponding to the dimer, with 29 C% Cg<br><br>
acid, corresponding to the monomer, 38 C% C7-10  acids and<br>
5 C% of C12+ acid, upon excluding the sulfolane used as<br>
solvent. Example 4<br>
In a similar way as described in example 1, carboxylic acids were prepared from ethanol, 2-propanol, and butene/water mixtures in molar ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 respectively.<br>
In the experiments VERSATIC 11 acid has been used as solvent for the conversion of butene and water, ethanol and 2-propanol.<br>
The relevant data have been listed in the following tables:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
»<br>
Example 5 with 1-butene and homogeneous catalyst<br>
To a 100 ml autoclave 30 ml (55 g.) of BF3/H3PO4/H2O<br>
(molar ratio 1.5/1/1) catalyst and an extra amount of 6.3 g. H2O were added to obtain a water concentration of<br>
18 %w. The autoclave was heated to 80 °C and pressurized with 80 bar CO. Then 1-butene was pumped into the autoclave during a period of 30 minutes with a flow of 10 ml/hr. The reaction was allowed to proceed for another 30 minutes at constant temperature and pressure, fresh CO being supplied as required for keeping the pressure constant (80 °C, 80 bar). Then the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature and depressurized. The autoclave content was poured into a separator funnel containing 50 g. ice. After vigorously shaking, the two liquid layers were allowed to separate and the water layer, containing residual BF3/H3PO4 catalyst, was removed. The<br>
crude product layer was washed twice again with 25 ml of H2O collected, dried over anhydrous MgS04 and analyzed<br>
with GC  using a 50 m capillary Free Fatty Acid Phase (FFAP) column with Helium as carrier gas. The product contained 40 %w dimer acids (C9 acid) and 30 %w 2-methyl<br>
butyric acid (monomer acid).<br>
Comparative Example la with di-isobutyl carbinol and<br>
heterogeneous catalyst<br>
AMBERLYST 38 was dried overnight in an oven at 100 °C and a sample of 4.4 g dry AMBERLYST was loaded in a 250 ml autoclave together with 28 ml pivalic acid solvent and 50 bar CO. The autoclave was then heated up to 150 °C under stationary CO gas cap and constant flow of 0.26 ml/h (1.5 mmol/h) DIBC and 0.26 ml/h (2.5 mmole/h) pivalic acid. The low feeding rate was chosen to ensure we have sufficient CO in the gas cap. After 17 h operation under these conditions the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature, depressurized and unloaded.<br><br>
The reaction product was analyzed as aescrxDea m ex. 1. The total product mixture contained some 73 C% carboxylic acids calculated as "free from solvent. The extracted acid fract ion contained 96 C% of C10 acids,<br>
