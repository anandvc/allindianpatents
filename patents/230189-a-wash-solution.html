				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Technical Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to compositions wherein a high concentration of a material<br>
with dermal anchoring/skin mechanical properties, such as high (more than 30%) glycerin, acts to<br>
enhance the effect of active ingredients, such as the anti-microbial agent chlorhexidine gluconate<br>
(CHG).<br>
2. Background of the Invention<br>
A variety of creams, loiions, washes and foams have been developed as an adjunct to<br>
protective gloves to sanitize and protect the skin from both the transmission and the receipt of<br>
infectious agents. These products contain a variety of wetting agents, fatty acids, solvents,<br>
emollients and other agents which act to protect the skin in a variety of ways. However, concern<br>
has been raised about the effect of these additives on a variety of active ingredients such as<br>
germicides (Larson, E., et al., Effects of a Protective Coating Foam on Scrubbing and Gloving,<br>
AMERICAN J. OF INFECTION CONTROL 21(6):297 (1993)). For example, it is taught that<br>
chlorhexidine and its derivative!; are inhibited by a variety of ingredients including anionic<br>
surfactants, soaps, gums, sodium alginate, magnesium aluminum silicate, magnesium trisilicate,<br>
bentonite, talc, kaolin, high pH, 3% lecithin/polysorbate 80 and polysorbate 80 (Interaction<br>
between Cosmetic Ingredients and Preservatives, COSMETICS &amp; TOILETRIES 110:81-86 (1995)).<br>
To address this concern, investigators have performed studies on the effect of various additives on<br>
the efficacy of active ingredients.<br>
Kihara, for example, teaches that the bactericidal activity of chlorhexidine digluconate and<br>
benzalkonium chloride (BAC) decreases in the presence of other ingredients such as serum,<br>
polysaccharides, non-ionic surfactants, powdered milk, dried bovine serum albumin, fish powder<br>
and other organic substances (U.S. Patent No. 5,017,617). Kihara states that most emollients used<br>
in cosmetics are nonionic surfactants or higher alcohols, so it is likely that they decrease the<br>
bactericidal activity of chlorhexidine digluconate and benzalkonium chloride. Therefore, Kihara<br>
tested a variety of emollients, including diesters of dibasic acids, triesters of citric acid or<br>
phosphoric acid, and polyglycerot (2 to 115 monomers), for their effect on chlorhexidine<br>
digluconate. Surprisingly, Kihara found that these di- and tri-esters enhanced, rather than<br><br>
inhibited, bactericidal activity. Kihara employs low concentrations of emollient (0.1-1.0%) in 50-<br>
95% ethanol and teaches that higher concentrations of emollient are to be avoided as producing a<br>
sticky feel. The mechanism of enhancement is not provided by Kihara, but it is possible that the<br>
long carbon chain, polar emollent molecules act on the bacterial membranes themselves, thus<br>
assisting the bactericidal effect of chlorhexidine digluconate.<br>
Similarly, in JP 63057502 assigned to Saraya, the inventors found that in alcohol<br>
disinfecting solutions containing ohlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) and an emollient selected from the<br>
group of diisopropyl adipate, diisobutyl adipate, higher fatty acid polyoxethylene glycerol and<br>
polyglycerol, the emollient enhanced the effect of CHG. Again, it may be that the long chain, fatty<br>
acids alone or in combination with CHG act on the bacterial membranes to assist the bactericidal<br>
effect of CHG alone.<br>
Loosemore tested the effect of polyvinyl alcohol and propylene glycol on the germicidal<br>
activity of 0.6% CHG in a teat dip application (U.S. Patent No. 5,641,498). Loosemore reported<br>
that neither ingredient adversely affected the activity of CHG. Although Loosemore's compositions<br>
contained 4% glycerin (also known as glycerol or glycerine), he neglected to compare the effect<br>
of this particular agent on the activity of CHG.<br>
Others, however, havt: studied the effect of glycerin on particular active ingredients.<br>
Mundschenk, for example, studied the effect of glycerin on the efficacy of hydrogen peroxide as<br>
an anti-microbial agent in a dentil cream (U.S. Patent No. 5,512,278). Mundschenk reported that<br>
20% glycerin did not negate the effectiveness of 3% hydrogen peroxide in this particular<br>
application. Similarly, Turck showed that addition of up to 10% glycerin did not decrease the anti-<br>
microbial activity of the disinfectant: N, N-dimethyldodecanamine on liquid cultures of<br>
Streptococcus agalactiae or Escherichia coli (Turck, P.A., et al Mastitis: Effect of pH,<br>
Temperature and emollients on Disinfecting Action of N, N-dimethyldodecanamine J. DAIRY Sci.<br>
65(10): 1987 (1982)), and Hicks showed that up to 6% glycerin did not affect the efficacy of<br>
chlorhexidine digluconate in a teat dip application (Hicks W.G., et ah, Evaluation of a Teat Dip<br>
of Chlorhexidine Digluconate (0.5%) with Glycerin (6%), J. DAIRY Sci. 64(11):2266 (1981)).<br>
Asaka teaches the use of 0.1-15% glycerin as an emollient used in combination with 25-80%<br>
lower alcohol, 0.01-4% cationic disinfectant such as CHG, and 1-40% amphoteric surfactant such<br>
as imidazolinium betaine (Australian Application No. AU-A-74370/94). Asaka notes that the<br><br>
emollients did not affect the disinfection by the cationic disinfectant, but states that concentrations<br>
higher than 15% may produce stickiness. Asaka's data shows that low levels of glycerin do not<br>
enhance the activity of CHG.<br>
JP 61130210 assigned to San-Star stowed that a paste containing CHG, 0.1-1% citric acid<br>
and 1-5% carrageenan improved the stability of CHG. A sample composition that also contained<br>
30% glycerin was provided.<br>
To date no one has studi ed the effect of high levels of glycerin and similar compounds on<br>
the efficacy of active ingredients such as the anti-microbial chlorhexidine gluconate.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
To date, no one has studied the effect of high levels of glycerin on a variety of active<br>
ingredients. We have shown that high glycerin does not inhibit and even has a synergistic effect on <br>
a cationic anti-microbial agent, acting to preserve its effectiveness over longer periods of time than <br>
similar compositions without glycerin or with low levels of glycerin.<br>
Though not wishing to be bound to any particular theory, it is hypothesized that high<br>
glycerin acts as a stratum corneum hydrator, creating a reservoir of glycerin in the stratum<br>
corneum. Studies have shown that high glycerin products actually deliver glycerin into the skin and<br>
increase the thickness of the entire stratum corneum (Appa, Y., et al, Clinical Evaluations of<br>
Hand and Body Moisturizers that Heal Skin Dryness, poster presentation at the 1992 American<br>
Academy of Dermatology, San Fnncisco, Dec. 6-7, 1992). It is believed that other materials with<br>
similar anchoring/substantive, hygroscopic and water solubility properties should have a similar<br>
effect, acting to penetrate the stratum corneum, hydrating it and providing a reservoir of water<br>
within which a polar active ingredient can dissolve/reside and be retained to increase its<br>
effectiveness. The effect may be even more pronounced where the active ingredient is both soluble<br>
in water and in the anchoring agent employed. This is true for the combination of CHG and<br>
glycerin because CHG is both water and glycerin soluble.<br>
To test this hypothesis, the effect of similar polyols such as propylene glycol, butylene<br>
glycol, erythritol, xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol, and inositol, etc., and closely related molecules such<br>
as aldoses like glyceraldehyde, erythrose, threose, xylose, ribose, arabinose, lyxose, etc., and<br>
ketoses such as dihydroxyacetone, erythrulose, ribulose, xylulose, etc. were studied. Additional<br>
anchoring agents useful in the invention can be identified in the manner described in Example 1 by<br>
substituting such agent for CHG therein. Anchoring agents that enhance the activity of CHG by<br><br>
20% are considered anchoring igents of this invention.<br>
Likewise, the high anchoring agent content, for example high glycerin content, of this<br>
invention can be combined with and improved by the addition of other agents. Many polymeric<br>
materials with anchoring and substantive properties may be combined with the anchoring agents<br>
described above, for example glycerin, to provide improved retention and slow release of soluble<br>
active ingredients. For example, substantive agents include octadecene-1/maleic anhydride<br>
copolymer, organofluorinated modified silicone resins, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, hydrogenated<br>
copolymers of styrene and butadiene, film forming copolymers, copolymers of eicosene and vinyl<br>
pyrrolidone, copolymer of hexadecane and vinyl pyrrolidone, cellulosic ethers, 2-hydroxyethyl<br>
methacrylate homopolymer, cocodimethyl ammonium salt of hydrolyzate of wheat protein, guar<br>
hydroxy propyltrimonium chloride, hydroxypropylcellulose, lauryldimonium hydroxypropyl<br>
hydrolyzed collagen, lauryldimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed wheat protein, polyquaternium-24<br>
and hyaluronic acid, soluble reticulin and soluble wheat protein, stearyldimonium hydroxypropyl<br>
hydrolyzed collagen, acrylic/acrylate copolymers, Behenoxy dimethicone, dimethicone copolyol<br>
phosphate, polydecene/polybutene copolymer, polymethacrylamidopropyl trimonium chloride,<br>
polymethylalkyl siloxane, and tht like.<br>
However, where the anchoring agent composition is intended to be used where latex gloves<br>
might also be used, for example in a surgical setting, it is preferred that oil-based ingredients be<br>
kept to a minimum if possible. This is because petroleum and mineral oil based additives are known<br>
to compromise the structural integrity of latex. Thus, water soluble ingredients are preferred in this<br>
type of application.<br>
Anti-microbial agents useful in the invention include nisin, bis-diguanides, chlorhexidine<br>
gluconate, chlorhexidine digluconate, chlorhexidine diacetate, chlorhexidine dihydrochloride,<br>
polyhexamethylene biguanide, benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, methylbenzethonium<br>
chloride, cetyl pyridinium chloride, triclosan, triclocarban, tribromsalan, amyltricresols,<br>
parachlorometaxylenol, phenol, iodine, nonylphenoxypoly (ethyleneoxy) ethanoliodine, poloxamer-<br>
iodine complex, undecoylium chloride iodine complex, bisquatemary ammonium compounds,<br>
polymeric quaternary ammoniun compounds, alcohols, cationic peptides, organometallic<br>
antiseptics, alkyl pyridinium salts, essential oils and their combinations and derivatives. Likewise,<br>
a variety of simple alcohols may function in this regard, including but not limited to, ethanol,<br><br>
propanol, butanol, pentanol, 1 -methyl-1-butanol, hexanol, 2-methyl-1-pentanol, 3-methyl-1-<br>
pentanol, 2-ethyl-1-butanol, 3,5,5-dimethyl-1-hexanol, heptanol, octanol, isooctyl alcohol, decanol,<br>
dodecanol, tridecanol, tetradecanol and the like.<br>
Additional active ingredients useful in the invention can be identified in the manner<br>
described in the Example by substituting such active ingredients for CHG and anti-histamines, for<br>
example, diphenylhydramine and phenyltoioxamine; anti-inflammatory agents, for example,<br>
hydrocortisone; analgesics, for example capsaicin; anesthetics, for example benzocaine; anti-<br>
perspirants; anti-dandruffs; astringents, for example calamine, aluminum acetate and zinc oxide;<br>
counter irritants, for example menthol and camphor; depigmenting or bleaching agents; steroids;<br>
and the like. Active ingredients that have at least 20% increased activity when combined with 40%<br>
glycerin are included in this invention.<br>

bars.<br>
Example: The Synergistic Effect of High Glycerin on CHG<br>
High (40%)glycerin and glycerin free formulations were tested for their effect on the<br>
germicidal effectiveness of a 4% solution of CHG per the technique described generally herein and<br>
adapted from Larson (Larson, E., et al, Effects of a Protective Coating Foam on Scrubbing and<br>
Gloving, AMERICAN J. OF INFECT ON CONTROL 21(6):297 (1993)). Ten healthy subjects over the<br>
age of 18 but less than 70 were screened and admitted into the study. Insofar as possible, subjects<br>
were of mixed sex and age. All were free of clinically evident dermatoses or injuries to the hands<br>
or forearms.<br>
During a 14-day pretest period, subjects avoided the use of medicated soaps, lotions,<br>
detergents and shampoos, as well as skin contact with solvents, acids and bases. Non-anti-<br>
microbial products were supplied to the subjects for their use throughout the pre-test period. This<br>
regimen allowed for the stabilization of the normal microbial populations of the hands.<br>
Subjects participated in the study for 5 consecutive days. The first two days subjects had<br>
a baseline microbial count taken of both hands by the Glove Juice Procedure. For the baseline<br>
determination, hands were washed using a liquid nonmedicated baseline soap control (BABY<br>
SAN®, a HUNTINGTON™ product) according to standard surgical scrub procedures.<br>
Subjects clipped fingernails to 2 mm free edge, if necessary. All jewelry was removed from<br>
hands and forearms. Subjects wet their hands, including two thirds (2/3) of the forearms, under<br>
running tap water 40 ± 2°C for thirty seconds. During this rinse, fingernails were cleaned with a<br>
nail cleaner. Hands were maintained higher than elbows during the wash procedure which was as<br>
follows. Hands and forearms were washed with 5 ml of baseline control soap for thirty (30)<br>
seconds using water as required to develop lather. Hands and forearms were rinsed thoroughly,<br><br>
removing all lather, for 30 seconds under running tap water at 40 ± 2°C. Hands were not dried,<br>
but gloved wet. This was followed by the Glove Juice Procedure.<br>
Glove Juice Procedure Following the prescribed wash and rinse, powder free sterile latex<br>
gloves (FISHERBRAND® POWDER-FREE, STERILE, LATEX SURGICAL GLOVES) were<br>
donned. At the designated Sampling times, 75 ml of sterile Stripping Suspending Fluid with<br>
neutralizes were placed into he glove. The wrist was secured, and an attendant massaged the<br>
hand through the glove in a standardized manner for 60 seconds. Aliquots of the glove juice were<br>
removed and serially diluted, 0°-106, in Butterfields Buffered Phosphate Solution.<br>
Duplicate pour plates were prepared from each of these dilutions on Tryptic Soy Agar with<br>
0.07% (w/v) lecithin and 0.5% Iween 80. Plates were incubated at 30°± 2° C for up to 72 hours.<br>
Those plates providing colony counts between 25 and 250 were counted and used. If the undiluted<br>
(10°) plates gave an average cc unt of 0, the average count was expressed as 1.00. This was done<br>
for mathematical reasons because the log10 of 0 is undefined, but the log10 of 1 is 0. The number<br>
of viable bacteria recovered was 75 X Dilution factor X mean plate count for the duplicate plates.<br>
Subjects followed standard surgical scrub techniques using a solution of 4% CHG for 3<br>
days. On day 3, after scrubbing the subjects applied 350 mg of either High Glycerin (HG) cream,<br>
700 mg Glycerin Free (GF) loton or no cream/lotion control. Microbial sampling was performed<br>
immediately after treatment or at 2 hours after treatment and the log10 reduction recorded as per<br>
Table 1. On day 4, no creams were used and on day 5, creams were applied prior to scrubbing.<br>
The results were as follows:<br><br><br>
noteworthy that enhancement of CHG occurs with low amounts of a high glycerin containing<br>
cream, but not with high amounts of a glycerin-free lotion.<br>
The data was evaluated using several Analysis of Variance models and the Students t test.<br>
The data shows that the high (40%) glycerin cream enhanced the effect of CHG activity 2 hours<br>
post scrub on test day S.<br>
Glycerin is a known humetant that has beneficial effects on skin conditioning due to its<br>
effects on the status of water in at least the outer layers of the stratum corneum. This is probably<br>
the result of glycerin interactions with the lipid proteins in the stratum corneum, altering their water<br>
binding and/or hydrophilic properties. Due to this phenomena, as glycerol increases in the skin, so<br>
does water increase to form a reservoir in which water soluble active ingredients, such as CHG,<br>
can be dissolved and retained against wash off. Additionally, where the active ingredient is itself<br>
soluble in glycerin, the enhancement effect is Jurther increased. These effects may explain the mode<br>
of action of glycerin enhancement of CHG activity.<br>
The enhancement is best seen when the skin is first treated with a dermal anchoring agent<br>
before washing with CHG. This is because a reservoir has been created into which the maximum<br>
amount of CHG can diffuse. When the dermal agent is used after the CHG wash, there is less CHG<br>
present to diffuse into the skin with the dermal anchoring agent, most of the CHG having already<br>
been rinsed off due to lack of 2. dermal anchoring agent. However, it is anticipated that the<br>
enhancement effect will occur whether the dermal anchoring agent is used simultaneously with,<br>
before or after the CHG wash, because this is always some amount of CHG retained on the skin<br>
even after rinsing.<br>
The invention has been described in an illustrative manner, and it is to be understood that<br>
the terminology which has been used is intended to be in the nature of description rather than of<br>
limitation.<br>
Obviously, many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light<br>
of the above teachings. It is, therefore, to be understood that within the scope of the appended<br>
claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.<br><br>
