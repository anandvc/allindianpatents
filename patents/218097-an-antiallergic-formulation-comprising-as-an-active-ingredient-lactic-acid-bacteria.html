				<td>The present invention relates to a method for producing an antiallergic agent.<br>
FIELD OF ART<br>
The present invention relates antiallergic agents. The invention also relates to use of the antiallergic agents for reducing allergy, and a method for reducing â€¢ allergy. BACKGROUND ART<br>
Allergic patients have been increasing in number every year in many countries including Japan, and high incident of allergic adults, one out of three in Japan, is reported. Allergic diseases are categorized into four types, type I to IV, depending on their mechanism of action.  Some kinds of allergic rhinitis such as pollinosis, bronchial asthma, and atopic dermatitis are Type I immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergy, wherein increase in antigen-specific IgE level in blood enhances the risk of developing allergic symptoms.<br>
The mechanism of development of Type I allergy is as follows. When an antigen, such as pollens, house dust, or mites, invades the body, an IgE antibody specific to<br>
such antigen is produced, and binds to mast cells or Fc receptors on the basophil surface to sensitize the subj ect. When the antigen further invades the body, the antigenbinds to the IgE antibody to form a complex. This causes degranulation, wherein chemical mediators in the granules , such as histamine and leukotoriene, are released to develop allergic symptoms.<br>
Recently, allergic diseases are treated mainly with antagonists to chemical mediators, such as antihistamine, and steroids used as anti-inflammatory agents.  However, both of these agents merely provide symptomatic therapy, and steroids inhibit the overall immune response, resulting in side effects.  Alternatively, agents for inhibiting release of chemical mediators by inhibition of degranulation are also used, but no fundamental therapeutic agents have not been found for specifically reducing the IgE antibody, which is the major factor of allergy development.<br>
Further, for necessary chronical administration, antiallergic agents that are easy to take and highly safe are desired.  Accordingly, novel antiallergic agents having such properties are demanded. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an antiallergic agent that is capable of improving allergic diathesis by reducing the IgE level, which is contributive to development of Type I allergy, and that is easy to take and highly safe, as well as a method for reducing allergy.<br>
In order to achieve the above object, the present inventors have constructed a mouse model wherein the antigen-specific IgE level has remarkably been elevated without substantial increase in the IgG level. Using this model, the inventors have made researches on IgE-level repressing effect of various lactic acid bacterial strains that may affect the intestinal immune system, to find out that, among the various tested lactic acid bacteria, certain bacteria have a particularly excellent inhibitory effect on IgE production, thereby completing the present invention.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided an antiallergic agent comprising, as an active ingredient, lactic acid bacteria selected from the group consisting of lactic acid bacteria of the species Lactobacillus acidophilus,   lactic acid bacteria of the species Lactobacillus   fermentum,   and combinations thereof.<br>
According to the present invention, there is also provided the antiallergic agent mentioned above, wherein said lactic acid bacteria of the species Lactobacillus acidophilus  are bacteria of the strain selected from the group consisting of Lactobacillus  acidophilus  CL0062 (deposited at International Patent Organism Depositary, FERM BP-4980), Lactobacillus acidophilus  CL92 (deposited at International Patent Organism Depositary, FERM BP-4981), and combinations thereof.<br>
According to the present invention, there is also provided the antiallergic agent mentioned above, wherein said lactic acid bacteria of the species Lactobacillus fermentum are of the strain Lactobacillus fermentum CP34 (deposited at International Patent Organism Depositary, FERM BP-8383) .<br>
According to the present invention, there is further provided the antiallergic agent mentioned above, which reduces, when administered orally, antigen-specific IgE level in blood in a mouse rhinitis model wherein antigen-specific IgE level in blood has been elevated by nasally exposing the mouse to continuous antigen stimulation.<br>
According to the present invention, there is also provided use of the particular lactic acid bacteria mentioned above in the manufacture of a medicament for reducing allergy.<br>
According to the present invention, there is further provided a method for reducing allergy comprising administering an effective dose of the antiallergic agent mentioned above to a subject in need of such reduction. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>

The content of the above-mentioned lactic acid bacteria in the antiallergic agent of the present invention is not particularly limited, and may suitably be adjusted depending on ease of production or a preferred daily dosage . For example, when the agent is in a liquid formulation, a preferred content of the bacteria is from 1 x 107 cells/ml to 1 X 1010 cells/ml.<br>
The antiallergic agent of the present invention may optionally contain other components, in addition to the lactic acid bacteria. Examples of such other components may include additives such as excipients, or components of the medium to be discussed later.<br>
The antiallergic agent of the present invention may be prepared by culturing the lactic acid bacteria in a medium.<br>
Any medium may be used for culturing, as long as the above-mentioned lactic acid bacteria may grow therein, and animal milk, skim milk, milk whey, MRS medium, GAM medium, BL medium, Briggs Liver Broth, or other synthetic media may be used. The temperature for the culture may be 25 Â°C to 50 Â°C, preferably 35 Â°C to 42 Â°C. The culture time may be 3 hours to 48 hours, preferably 8 hours to 12 hours. The cultured medium may be used as the antiallergic agent of the present invention with or without further processing. For example, the bacterial cells harvested from the cultured medium by centrifugation or filtration, a <br>
lyophilized product thereof, a heat-treated product thereof, or ground bacterial cells may be used as the antiallergic agent of the present invention.  Further, the bacterial cells in the above forms may further be formulated, or blended in various food materials such as beverages, tablets, pastes, or bread, before use as the antiallergic agent of the present invention.<br>
The antiallergic agent of the present invention may be administered by any route, but oral administration is preferred. The dosage may be not lower than 2 x 109 cells per day, preferably 2 x 1010 cells per day for oral administration to human. This dosage of agent may be administered in a single dose or in a plurality of doses per day.<br>
The antiallergic agent of the present invention effectively suppresses the IgE level as will be demonstrated in Examples, and is expected to be highly safe since the active ingredient of this agent is bacterial cells taken as food.<br>
The method for reducing allergy according to the present invention includes the step of administering an effective dose of the antiallergic agent mentioned above to a subject in need of such reduction.  The subject may be animals such as human or other mammals.<br>
The antiallergic agent of the Present invention effectively suppresses the IgE level in living organisms, and is easy to take and highly safe .  Thus the present agent<br><br><br>
is useful for suppressing allergy involving excess IgE<br>
level.<br>
Examples<br>
The present invention will now be explained in more detail with reference to Examples, which are illustrative only and do not intend to limit the present invention. Example 1 (Preparation of IgE-elevated Mice)<br>
Male BALB/c mice were obtained from Charles River Japan, and raised under free access to CE-2 (CLEA Japan, Inc.) as a feed.  10 Î¼g of ovalbumin (abbreviated as OVA hereinbelow, manufactured by SIGMA CHEMICAL CO. ) and 2 rag of aluminum hydroxide (WAKO PURE CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES,<br>
LTD.) as an adjuvant were suspended in 300 ul  of saline. Ten of the above mice at six weeks old were injected intraperitoneally with this suspension on the first day of sensitization and on day 4 for primary sensitization. For secondary sensitization, the nose of each mouse was soaked in an OVA antigen solution containing 25 mg OVA/ml of saline for three seconds, and this soaking operation was repeated three times as one cycle.  Two cycles of soaking operation was performed per day, and the daily soaking was performed from day 10 to day 16 to prepare IgE-elevated mice.<br>
Blood samples were obtained from the ophthalmic veins of the IgE-elevated mice on the first day and day 17 of sensitization, and serum samples were obtained.  The OVA-specific IgE (abbreviated as OVA-IgE hereinbelow), the total IgE, and the total IgG in the serum samples were measured in accordance with the methods to be discussed below.  The results are shown in Figs. 1(a) to 1(c).<br>
From the results shown in Figs. 1(a) to 1(c), it is understood that the increase in total IgE and OVA-IgE levels in blood were remarkably larger than that in IgG level as a result of the sensitization. Accordingly, a mouse allergy model was constructed, wherein the IgE and the antigen-specific IgE levels in blood were elevated without change in the entire immune system. (Measurement of Blood OVA-IgE)<br>
The blood OVA-IgE level was measured by the sandwich<br>
ELISA.  100 \il  of saline solution containing 10 |ig/ml of a sheep polyclonal anti-mouse IgE antibody (trade name AAMll, manufactured by DAINIPPON PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD.) was added to each well of a 96-well immunoplate (manufactured by CORNING INCORPORATED), and incubated<br>
overnight at 4 Â°C.  The plate was washed three times with a phosphate buffer (containing 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 8.1 mM Na2HPO4  and 1.5 mM KH2po4, abbreviated as PBS hereinbelow), coated with 0.5 % casein-PBS, and incubated for 3 hours at room temperature.  After the plate was<br>
washed three times with PBS, 100 ul of a 1/10 PBS dilution of a serum sample was added to each well, and reacted overnight at 4 Â°C.  After the plate was washed four times with PBS, 100 u1 of 0.5 % casein-PBS solution containing 10 Î¼g/ml of OVA that had been biotinylated using a Biotinylation kit (manufactured by AMERICAN QUALEX INTERNATIONAL INC. ) (biotin-labeled OVA) was added to each well, and reacted for 2 hours at room temperature.  After the plate was washed five times with PBS, 100 Î¼l of a PBS solution containing 1 Î¼g/ml of streptavidin-peroxidase (manufactured by SIGMA CHEMICAL Co.) and 0.5 % casein was added to each well, and reacted for 1 hour at room temperature.  After the plate was washed five times with 0.1%-Tween 20 in PBS, 100 Î¼1 of 0.2 M citric acid buffer (prepared by mixing 0.2 M citric acid and 0.2 M trisodium citrate and adjusting the pH to 5) containing 600 Î¼g/ml of 2,2' -azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (abbreviated as ABTS hereinbelow, manufactured by BOEHRINGER MANNHEIM) and 0.006 % hydrogen peroxide was<br>
added to each well, and shielded for 3 hours at 37 Â°C for coloration.  After the reaction was completed, OD405 and OD492 were measured, and the true optical density was obtained by OD405 value - OD492 value.<br>
A blood sample was obtained from a mouse that had been injected intraperitoneally with 25 mg/ml of OVA in saline five times (once a week) . From the blood sample, a serum sample was prepared as a standard serum. This standard serum was diluted 1/10 with PBS, and the resulting dilution was further diluted stepwise to twice with non-immunized serum to prepare working dilutions. These working dilutions were subjected to measurements of the coloring values in accordance with the above procedures, to obtain a working curve.  Based on this working curve, the OVA-IgE levels in the serum samples were obtained as relative amounts with respect to the OVA-IgE level in the standard serum being as 1. (Measurement of Total IgE in Blood)<br>
50 ul of saline solution containing 10 ug/ml of a sheep polyclonal anti-mouse IgE antibody (trade name AAMll, manufactured by DAINIPPON PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD.) was added to each well of a 96-well immunoplate (manufactured<br>
by CORNING INCORPORATED) , and incubated overnight at 4 Â°C. The plate was washed three times with PBS, coated with 0.5% casein-PBS, and incubated for 3 hours at room temperature .<br>
After the plate was washed three times with PBS, 50 Î¼l of a 1/25 dilution of a serum sample in 0.5% casein-PBS was<br>
added to each well, and reacted overnight at 4 Â°C. After the plate was washed four times with PBS, 50 Î¼l of a PBS solution containing 2 Î¼g/ml of biotin-labeled anti-mouse IgE antibody (manufactured by YAMASA CORPORATION) and 0 . 5 % casein was added to each well, and reacted for 2 hours at room temperature. After the plate was washed five times with 0.1%-Tween 20 in PBS, 50 )ul of a PBS solution containing 1 Î¼g/ml of streptavidin-peroxidase and 0.5 % casein was added to each well, and reacted for 1 hour at room temperature. After the plate was washed five times with 0 .1%-Tween 20 in PBS, 50 Î¼l of 0.2 M citric acid buffer (pH5) containing 300 Î¼g/ml of ABTS and 0.006 % hydrogen peroxide was added to each well, and shielded for 20 to 30 minutes at room temperature for reaction. Then OD405 was measured.<br>
On the other hand, mouse anti-DNP-IgE (manufactured by YAMASA CORPORATION), instead of the serum samples, was dissolved in 0.5 % casein-PBS at various concentrations, and subjected to the same procedures as above to obtain a working curve. Based on this working curve, the total IgE levels in the serum samples were calculated. (Measurement of Total IgG in Blood)<br>
50 Î¼l of saline containing 1 Î¼g/ml of goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) antibody (trade name 62-6500, manufactured by ZYMED LABORATORIES, INC.) was added to each well of a 96-well immunoplate (manufactured by CORNING INCORPORATED) , and incubated overnight at 4 Â°C.  The plate was washed three times with PBS, coated with 0.5 % casein-PBS, and incubated for 3 hours at room temperature.<br>
After the plate was washed three times with PBS, 50 Î¼l of a 1/1000 dilution of a serum sample in 5% casein-PBS was<br>
added to each well, and reacted overnight at 4 Â°C. After the plate was washed four times with PBS, 50 Î¼l of a PBS solution containing 2 Î¼g/ml of peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG(Y) antibody (manufactured by CAPPEL LABORATORIES, INC.) and 0 . 5 % casein was added to each well, and reacted for 2 hours at room temperature. After the plate was washed five times with 0.1%-Tween 20 in PBS, 50 Î¼l of 0.2 M citric acid buffer (pH5) containing 300 Î¼g/ml of ABTS and 0.006 % hydrogen peroxide was added to each well, and shielded for 20 to 30 minutes at room temperature for reaction.  Then OD405 was measured.<br>
On the other hand, purified mouse IgG (manufactured by CAPPEL LABORATORIES, INC. ) , instead of the serum samples, was dissolved in 0 . 5 % casein-PBS at various concentrations, and subjected to the same procedures as above to obtain a working curve.  Based on this working curve, the total IgG levels in the serum samples were calculated. Example 2 (Comparison in Effect of Various Lactic Acid Bacteria)<br>
Each of the lactic acid bacterial strains shown in<br>
Table 1 was precultured in MRS medium overnight at 37 Â°C, and the cells were harvested by centrif ugation at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes.  9% (W/V) reconstituted skim milk (containing 0.1% (W/V) yeast extract (manufactured by DIFCO)) was fermented with the collected cells at 37 Â°C until the milk was coagulated.  After the fermentation, the total cell count of each fermented milk was measured. The results are shown in Table 1.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
Next, IgE-elevated mice were prepared in the same way as in Example 1, and the blood OVA-IgE was measured on day 18 of sensitization in the same way as in Example 1. The mice were divided into groups of 10 mice per group with the same average of blood OVA-IgE levels. From day 19 to 21 of sensitization, various fermented milks shown above, non-fermented 9% (W/V) reconstituted skim milk, or non-fermented 9 w/v% reconstituted skim milk containing<br>
750 ug of cyclophosphamide were administered gastrically to each group of mice in dosages of 1 ml per day for three days. On day 22 of sensitization, blood samples from the mice were obtained from the ophthalmic veins, and serum samples were prepared. The blood OVA-IgE and the total IgG levels were measured. As a control, a blood sample from a mouse, which had been sensitized in the same way but given no fermented milk or the like, was obtained in the same way, and the blood OVA-IgE and the total IgG levels were measured.  The results are shown in Fig. 2.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, in the groups of mice given  Lactobacillus  acidophilus  or Lactobacillus  fermentum fermented milk, significant inhibitory effect (p

The number of cells was measured for each strain, and the cells were suspended in 9 % skim milk at a concentration of 1x106 cells per 1 ml to obtain suspensions.<br>
Next, IgE-elevated mice were prepared in the same way as in Example 1, and the blood OVA-IgE was measured on day 18 of sensitization in the same way as in Example 1.  The mice were divided into groups of 10 mice per group with the same average of blood OVA-IgE levels.  From day 19 to 21 of sensitization, the above suspensions were administered gastrically to each group of mice in dosages of 1 ml per day for three days .

The results are shown in Fig. 4.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, in both groups of mice given Lactobacillus acidophilus CL92 strain or Lactobacillus fermentum CP34 strain, significant inhibitory effect in OVA-IgE level was observed, compared to the group given non-fermented skim milk. No significant difference was observed in total IgG level in blood (not shown).<br>
The reduction rate d in OVA-IgE level when each suspension was administered is obtained by the formula d=l-(b/a), wherein a represents the standard ratio of OVA-IgE level when the non-fermented skim milk was fed, and b represents the standard ratio of OVA-IgE when each suspension was fed.  Denoting the cell concentration of the suspension administered to mice by s (cells/ml), and assuming that s is in proportion to the reduction ratio d, the number of cells x (cells/ml) in the suspension required for reducing the OVA-IgE level by half in this<br>
experimental system is obtained by the formula x= (sxO . 5) /d. Using this formula, the number of cells x for each bacterial strain used in Examples 2 and 3 was obtained.  The results are shown in Table 3.<br>

Example 5<br>
(Clinical Effect on Human)<br>
Thirteen subjects suffering from perennial allergic rhinitis (average age 22.9 + 6.1 years old, 6 males and 7 females) were given, after 2 weeks of observation period, 100 ml/day of fermented milk containing 8.0 x 108 to 1.3 X 109 cells/ml of Lactobacillus acidophilua  CL 92 strain for 4 weeks.  Questionnaires on subjective symptoms were issued at intervals, and based on the responses the symptoms were scored in accordance with the "Severity Classification of Allergic Rhinitis" provided by Japanese Society of Allergology.  Symptoms of rhinitis were diagnosed at intervals in accordance with the guideline of Japanese Society of Allergology.  Blood samples were obtained from the subjects at intervals, and the IgE titers in blood were measured.  Further, the lowest temperature of the day was recorded during the test period. Severity of nasal congestion of the subjects, frequency of nose blowing, and the lowest temperature of the day during the test period are shown in Figs. 5 and 6.<br>
During the test period, the lowest temperature of the day fluctuated greatly from 14 Â°C on the first day of intake (November 15) down to 3.7 Â°C on the last day of intake (December 13) over more than 10 Â°C.  Even under such conditions to deteriorate the rhinitis symptoms, nose congestion showed a tendency to improve two weeks after the commencement of intake (Wilcoxon test: p
