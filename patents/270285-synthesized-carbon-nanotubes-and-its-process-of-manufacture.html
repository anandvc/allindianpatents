				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to synthesized carbon nanotubes and to the<br>
process of manufacture of such carbon nanotubes by way of a simple and cost<br>
effective manner of manufacture. Carbon nanotubes are effective for use in flat<br>
panel displays and also in strategic areas using light weight and high impact<br>
resistance coatings. The synthesized carbon nanotubes of the invention can be<br>
applied as materials for sensor applications, materials for scanning probe<br>
microscope tips and light weight high strength materials for defense and space<br>
applications.<br>
Background Art<br>
Carbon nanotubes were first discovered in 1991 by lijima et al. (Nature 354, 56<br>
(1991). Since its development there has been continued research and<br>
developmental activities on carbon nanotubes. Importantly, the encouraging<br>
physical and chemical properties of carbon nanotubes have lead to development<br>
of nanoscale devices several of which are discussed in various references [<br>
S.Saito, Science 278, 77 (1977); S.J. Tans, A. R. M. Verschueren and C. Dekker,<br>
Nature 393, 49 (1998); T.W. Tombler, C. Zhou, L. Alexseyev, J. Kong, H. Dai, L.<br>
Liu, C. S. Jayanthi, M. Tang and S. Y. Wu, Nature 405, 769 (2000), A. Bachtold,<br>
P. Hadley, T. Nakanishi and C. Dekker, Science 294, 1317 (2001) ; G. Zhou, W.<br>
Duan and B. Gu, Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 095504 (2001); F. Leonard and J. Tersoff,<br>
Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 258302 (2002) ].<br>
The synthesis of carbon nanotubes commonly involve method such as arc<br>
discharge [ C. Journet, W. K. Maser, P/ Bernier, A. Loiseau, M. L. De La<br>
Chapelle, S. Lefrant, P. Deniart, R. Lee, J. E. Fischer, Nature 388, 756 (1997), ]<br>
laser ablation [ A. Thess, R. Lee, P. Nikolaev, H. Dai, P. Petit, J. Robert, C. Xu,<br>
Y. H. Lee, S. G. Kim, A. G. Rinzler, D. T. Colbert, G. E. Scuseria, D. Tomanek,<br>
J.E. Fischer and R.E. Smalley, Science 273, 483 (1996) ] and CVD processes [<br>
M. Ge and K. Sattler, Science 260, 515 (1993) ]. However, it has been found that<br>
all such presently known synthesis techniques inherently produced carbon<br>
nanotubes alongwith various impurities in the form of amorphous carbon, metal<br>
catalyst and many carbonaceous particle:; etc. Thus such carbon nanotubes<br>
obtained following conventional processes required further purification  and<br><br>
suspension to produce high quality CNTs for device applications. Moreover,<br>
such processes required the suspension in-solvent before depositing them on<br>
suitable substrates. Also, it is found that all such purification and suspension<br>
procedures further lead to the CNTs containing various defects on their surfaces<br>
which again affect the electronic property and in turn the device performance.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
It us thus the basic object of the present invention to provide for directly<br>
synthesized CNTs onto the wafer/substrate which would be simple and cost-<br>
effective.<br>
Another object is to provide for the process for manufacture of CNTs directly onto<br>
the wafer/substrate in the purest form which would be very cost-effective and<br>
simple.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is directed to provide for manufacture<br>
of CNTs directly onto the wafer/substrate in the purest form which would be<br>
capable of industrial use and in particular large scale synthesis of CNTs by way<br>
of a simple and cost effective process.<br>
Yet further object is directed to large scale synthesis of CNTs directly onto the Si<br>
and Sn02 coated glass substrates by way of a simple and cost effective electro<br>
deposition technique which can be further used to achieve coating even on<br>
irregular surfaces.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is directed to large scale synthesis of<br>
CNTs directly onto irregular surfaces/substrates by way of a simple and cost-<br>
effective electro deposition technique.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Thus according to the basic aspect of the present invention there is provided<br>
synthesized CNTs comprising of CNTs directly electro-deposited in pure form on<br>
wafer/substrates.<br><br>
In the above synthesized CNTs the wafer/substrates can be selected from Si and<br>
Sn02 coated glass substrates.<br>
In accordance with a another aspect of the present invention there is provided a<br>
process for synthesis of carbon nanotubes by direct electro-deposition on<br>
substrates comprising:<br>
-	providing an electrolyting bath comprising acetonitrile (CH3CN) and water as<br>
the selective electrolyte;<br>
-	said electrolytic bath having as one of its electrodes the substrate for<br>
deposition of the CNTs and a graphite counter electrode;<br>
-	means to carry out electrolysis such as to deposit the CNTs directly on to the<br>
said substrates.<br>
In the above process of the invention, the selective use of acetonitrile and water<br>
as the electrolyte provided for the desired concentration of methyl radicals and<br>
hydrogen ions due to electrolyte dissociation. Such methyl radicals and<br>
hydrogen ions present in the solvent importantly provide for the desired formation<br>
of films i.e. the direct deposition of CNTs on the substrate.<br>
The above electro deposition technique apart from being simple, is cost-effective<br>
and is industrially applicable for large scale production of the CNTs.<br>
In accordance with a preferred aspect the process for direct synthesis of CNTs in<br>
accordance with the invention comprise;<br>
-	providing the electrolyte bath comprising acetonitrile (CH3CN) and water as<br>
the selective electrolyte and using a graphite anode as the counter electrode<br>
and the substrate selected from Si wafers and Sn02 coated glass as the other<br>
cathode electrode;<br>
-	carrying out the electrolysis at atmospheric pressure and a bath temperature<br>
of about 273 K .to 350 K, preferably 300K.<br><br>
In accordance with yet further aspect the process for direct synthesis of carbon<br>
nanotubes on Si wafer/Sn02 coated glass comprise:<br>
-	providing the electrolytic bath comprising acetonitrile and water as the<br>
selected electrolyte and using a graphite anode electrode and a selected<br>
substrate for direct deposition thereon of CNTs as the cathode electrode;<br>
-	carrying out the electrolysis at atmospheric pressure and bath temperature of<br>
273 K to 350 K, preferably 300 K in the presence of an applied magnetic field.<br>
The application of magnetic field during electro-deposition was found to have a<br>
special effect on the alignment of carbon nanotubes. When the deposition was<br>
carried out at different magnetic field applied perpendicular to the electric field it<br>
is expected that the radicals (ChV) and (ions) (H+;OH-) would experience Lorentz<br>
force. Thus the ions move in the direction of the cathode in a helical path whose<br>
diameter depend on the magnitude of both the electric and magnetic field. In<br>
this way the carbon nanotubes grow in bunches and align with longer length than<br>
those obtained without the application of magnetic field. The nanotubes could be<br>
seen to be aligned parallel to the substrate surface. Order of the magnetic field<br>
applied can be in the range of 0.2 to 1 K Gauss, preferably, the order of the<br>
magnetic field applied perpendicular to the electro field can be higher in the range<br>
of 0.8 to 0.9 K Gauss for better results.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In the above process of the invention selective use of acetonitrile and water as<br>
the electrolyte has been carried out. As explained above, such selective<br>
electrolyte provide for certain concentration of methyl radicals and hydrogen ions<br>
due to electrolytic dissociation. The methyl radicals and hydrogen ions in the<br>
solvents play a critical role in the formation of the CNTs films.<br>
The carbon nanotubes can be the result of folding graphite layers into carbon<br>
cylinders of single shell (single-walled nanotubes) or of multishells (multi-walled<br>
nanotubes). Therefore, by suitably choosing the electrolyte and the deposition<br>
parameters it is possible to deposit carbon nanotubes by the electro deposition<br>
technique.<br><br>
The carbon nanotubes were deposited preferably onto Si (wafers) resistivity<br>
approximately 5 to 20 ohm cm preferably 15 ohm-cm ; size approx. 6 mm to 15<br>
mm x6 mm to 10mm x 0.1mm to 0.4 mm preferably 10mm x 8mm x 0.3 mm and<br>
SnC&gt;2 coated glass size approximately 8 mm to 15.mm x 6 mm .to 12 mm x 2 mm<br>
.to 5 mm preferably 10mm x 8 mm x 4mm) which were attached to a copper<br>
cathode.<br>
As discussed above, the graphite was used as the counter electrode (anode).<br>
Before mounting the substrates on the cathode, they were thoroughly cleaned<br>
and rinsed with deionized water and ethanol solution respectively.<br>
In accordance with a further aspect of the invention, the electrodes were<br>
separated by a distance of approximately 6 mm .to. 10 mm preferably 8 mm. The<br>
applied DC voltage between the electrodes was kept at 15..to 25. V preferably<br>
20V by using a DC power supply capable of generating stabilized voltage (30V,<br>
2A). The deposition was carried out for about 10-20 hours.<br>
The substrates in the process used is required to be cleaned thoroughly before<br>
use in deposition. The optimum voltage, time of deposition and composition of<br>
the electrolyte need to be appropriately maintained to achieve the desired objects<br>
and advantages.<br>
The details of the invention its objects and advantages are explained hereunder<br>
in greater detail in relation to non-limiting exemplary illustrations hereunder:<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example - 1: Process according to the invention<br>
To carryout the process of the invention, an electrolytic bath was used with water<br>
and acetonitrile (1% v/v) as the selective electrolyte solution. Graphite was used<br>
as the anode while a low resistive (15 ohm cm) Si and Sn02 coated glass<br>
substrate was used at the cathode for depositing the carbon nanotubes.<br><br>
The electrolysis was carried out at an applied DC potential of about 20V. The<br>
electrolysis for a period of 12 hours resulted in deposition of carbon nanotubes as<br>
films on the substrates in both the Si and SnO2 coated substrates.<br>
The growth of CNTs on the substrate achieved in the two cases (Examples 1 &amp; 2)<br>
were monitored and the results illustrated in accompanying figures 1-6<br>
The growth of CNTs on the substrate in case of the process of the Example I was<br>
confirmed by XRD, SEM, Raman, Optical absorbance, FTIR and ESR<br>
measurements. The results of which are illustrated by way of accompanying<br>
figures 1-6.<br>
In particular, the XRD Spectra (figure 2) of the films shown (002), (100) and (004)<br>
reflections which could be assigned to the hexagonal ring structure of graphite<br>
sheets forming the carbon nanotubes. The UV - VIS - NIR optical reflectance<br>
spectra of CNT deposits showed two stronger reflection peaks at 1880 nm and<br>
935 nm alongwith a weaker and broader one at 700 nm. The stronger peak is<br>
assigned to the first and second interband optical transitions of the CNTs and the<br>
one at 700 nm to the metallic CNTs respectively. This indicated the presence of<br>
higher content of the semiconducting CNT bundles in the films than the metallic<br>
CNT bundles.<br>
The Raman Spectra generated contained the confirmative signature of the<br>
presence of carbon nanotubes in the films obtained following Example 1. The<br>
films showed a sharp feature 1354 cm"1 (D-Band) and 1600 cm"1 (G-Band). The<br>
photoluminescence specter are dominated by a sharp peak centre 0.95 eV which<br>
could be related to the band-edge transition (figure 7a and 7b).<br>
The field emission properties of the CNTs films were further analyzed using the<br>
Fowler Nordheim Model. The values of effective work function ( Øe = Øß) and ß<br>
derived from FN plots of the films varied between 130-150 meV and 2000-2200<br>
respectively for the films presented under Example 1. Thus these films obtained<br>
following the Example 1 serve as good materials for flat panel display devices.<br><br>
FTIR and ESR measurements also indicated the growth of carbon nanotubes in<br>
the films.<br>
lit is thus possible by way of the present invention to provide for large scale<br>
synthesis of CNTs directly onto the wafer onto the substrates in their purest form<br>
and very cost-effective and scalable technique. The present invention further<br>
provides to synthesis CNTs directly onto the Si and (SnO2 coated glass<br>
substrates) by simple electro deposition technique. Importantly, the process of<br>
the invention apart from being scalable is also found to provide for cost<br>
competitive coating on irregular surfaces.<br>
