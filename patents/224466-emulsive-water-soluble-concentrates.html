PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br>
Water-Soluble Emulsion-Concentrates<br>
The present invention relates to water-soluble emulsion-concentrates according to the features of claim 1 and their use in cosmetic, pharmaceutical or dietetic products.<br>
Lipophilic substances in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic or dietetic field usually have to be transfered into a problem-free application form. An actually problem-free application form is the emulsion with emulsifiers reducing the surface tension at the interface of fat droplets thus providing a fine and stable distribution of fat in water. Depending on the field of application there are emulsions from creamlike to milky consistency with amounts of emulsifiers from 0.5 - 10% (w/w). The particle size of the fat droplets of a conventional emulsion depends on many factors, like fat, emulsifier, applied energy und is usually within a three digit nm-range (100 - 1000 ran).<br>
Special questions and applications demand for transparent to translucent products with sizes of the droplets within a one to two digit nm range (5 - 100 ran). Such formulations can only be prepared by micellar solubilization. Lipophilic materials are solubilized in form of mixed micells with a mixture of a suitable solubilizer (emulsifier) and a coemulsifier to give transparent formulations.<br>
In the field of cosmetics and dermatology visually esthetical products are needed containing poorly water-soluble substances in partly high concentrations. Besides the appearance such products are supposed to have an excellent physical stability. Examples are transparent bath oils in cosmetics and dermatology with triglycerides, mineral oils and essential oils as lipophilic substances.<br>
Perfumes predominantly contain lipophilic fragrances as well dissolved in a clear transparent form. Poorly water-soluble pharmaceuticals are also processed to transparent formulations for oral or parenteral applications.<br>
2<br><br>
It is the objective of a topical, oral or parenteral applied product to use the lipophilic active substance. Emulsifiers or coemulsifiers are unwanted but to date technologically necessary auxiliary substances.<br>
It is state of the art that the solubilization of Upophilic substances to transparent systems in the above mentioned fields of application can be made exclusively with ethoxylated surfactants or surfactants having a high HLB-value and/or with alcohols. However, these solubilizers have serious deficiencies-.<br>
-	the highly volatile alcohols -VOC- (Ethanol, Isopropanol) are strong<br>
cytotoxins<br>
and<br>
-	concerning the protection of the atmosphere they are unwanted in many formulations.<br>
-	Emulsifiers have to be used in big quantities for the solubilization process so that the application of the actually active substance requires considerable quantities of auxiliary substances. In order to solubilize for example 1 g lavender oil in the common way 5 g PEG 40 hydrogenated castor oil in a 25% (w/w) ethanolic solution are needed. Or in order to solubilize for example 20 g vitamin E-acetate in the common way 44 g PEG 36 hydrogenated castor oil and 25 g propylene glycol in an aqueous solution are needed. And in order to solubilize the lipophilic vitamins A, E and D in the common way a ten times excess of a mixture of glycocholic acid and phosphatidylcholine is needed for example.<br>
DE-198 59 427 Al discloses the production of micellar dissolved lipophilic substances to transparent systems in the form of microemulsions. As a system of emulsifier -/coemulsifier exclusively a mixture of lecithin and ethoxylated emulsifiers, lecithin/emulsifiers with high HLB-value or lecithin/highly volatile alcohols are used.<br>
3<br><br>
DE 199 22 193 describes the production of a typical milky fat emulsion of hydrogenated lecithin, essential oils and water and the production of optically transparent concentrates.<br>
The present invention has the objective to dissolve poorly water-soluble substances to transparent or translucent water-soluble emulsion-concentrates and to apply these concentrates.<br>
This objective is achieved with water-soluble emulsion-concentrates according to the invention with the features of claim 1 and the application of these water-soluble emulsion concentrates with the features of claim 10.<br>
Contrary to micellar systems up to date the advantage is achieved with the invention that it refrains completely from a second emulsifier as well as from mono- or dihydric alcohols. Further surprisingly, related to the lipophilic substance, this could be done with a lack of phospholipids. Thus being in contradiction to the conventional possibilities up to date to achieve solubilization.<br>
According to the invention ethoxylated surfactants or other strong solubilizers can be replaced by a system of natural substances (lecithins/phospholipids/polyols) being uncritical for the health and safe for the environment.<br>
According to the invention only 5 - 100 % (w/w)of the mass of a fat is needed as solubilizer for the solubilization process (lecithins/phospholipids). With procedures up to date this proportion is inverse.<br>
According to the invention highly volatile organic solubilizers (ethanol, isopropanol, etc.) can be avoided.<br>
According to the invention water-soluble emulsion-concentrates are created by means of a one step production process resulting in an opaque to transparent, finely<br>
4<br><br>
dispersed emulsion after dilution with water. This type of emulsion would not or only much more difficult be manufacturable if the emulsion-concentrate is avoided.<br>
These new concentrates can be produced best by means of a high pressure homogenizer.<br>
Rotor-stator mixers achieve less transparent concentrates. The disadvantage from DE 198 59 427, caused by metal abrasion in high pressure homogenizers, is disposed by using ceramic for homogenization in respective devices.<br>
The concentrates according to the invention can be used directly as products for e. g. medical or cosmetic bath oils, mouthwash, perfumeoils, beverages or food-supplements or can be transferred by dilution with water or other aqueous solutions (e. g. juices) to finely dispersed, transparent - opaque o/W emulsions (nanoemulsions) with very small distribution of particle sizes in the two to three digit nm range. Due to the very good solubilization in water these transparent emulsion concentrates can be incorporated without problems into cosmetic products (gel, cream, lotions, etc.) pharmaceutical or dietetic products.<br>
The production of a water-soluble emulsion-concentrate of lecithins and/or phospholipids, lipids and highly concentrated solutions of polyols or carbohydrates takes place as follows:<br>
-	The ratio of lecithin/phospholipid to lipophilic substance should be chosen in such a way that a transparent concentrate results allowing dilution in water without problems and<br>
-	the part of water of the polyol- or carbohydrate solution should be chosen in such a way that not only a transparent concentrate results but also - due to the low value of water - a self preserving system of a kind that the addition of synthetic or as well natural preservatives can be avoided.<br>
-	The process temperature should be adapted to the used lecithins/phospholipids or to the solubilized lipids. Hydrogenated lecithins/phospholipids need naturally process temperatures from 40 to 80<br>
5<br><br>
°C, unsaturated lecithins/phospholipids can be processed at room temperature the lecithins/phospholipids being integrated preferably into the polar phase, i. e. into the polyol- or carbohydrat solutions.<br>
The present invention is presented by means of preferred examples.<br>
Example 1:<br>
5 g of a fraction of phospholipids from soya with a PC-content of 70% is dispersed by stirring in 75 g of 86% glycerin. 20 g vitamin E-acetate is added and distributed by continuous stirring. Homogenisation of this roughly dispersed inhomogeneous mixture by means of a high pressure homogenizer. A transparent emulsion-like solution with high viscosity results.<br>
Example 2:<br>
5 g of a fraction of phospholipid from soya with a PC-content of 70% is dispersed by stirring in 75 g of a 70% fructosesolution. After the addition of 20 g of a medium chain triglyceride followed by high pressure homogenisation of this mixture a transparent emulsion-like solution with honey type viscosity will be obtained.<br>
6<br><br>
