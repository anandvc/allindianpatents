A method and system for managing confidential information.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to the field of managing and securing digital information. More specifically, the present invention deals with methods for classification management and tracking digital information over the course of its lifecycle.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION .<br>
The information and knowledge assets created and accumulated by organizations and businesses are of extreme value in the modern economical environment. As such, managing and keeping the information and the knowledge inside the organization and restricting its distribution outside, is of paramount importance for almost any organization, government entity or business and provides a significant leverage over its value. Most of the information in modern organizations and businesses is represented in a digital format that can be easily distributed via digital communication netwoi'ks. However, ease of the promptness, comfort and information availability offered by these digital networks is accompanied by a constant hazard of information leak due to innocent mistakes, carelessness and malicious attempts to deliver non-public or otherwise confidential information to unauthorized entities. Information losses can cause anything from minor embarrassment to severe financial damage by enabling fraud and by causing loss of business secrets and consequent competitive advantage. In addition, such loss may expose the organization to legal sanctions and liabilities (e.g., under the US Gramm-Leach-BIiley act, the US Sarbanes-Oxley act, the US HIPAA privacy and security regulations, and directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament). In order to exploit the value of information and commercial knowledge to as large an extent as possible, whilst mitigating risks that stem from unauthorized dissemination of information, the information distribution needs to be carefully and skillfully managed.<br>
Managing information distribution includes several aspects, such as:<br><br>
•	Making the information explicitly available to authorized persons so that they can utilize the information in order to create value for the organization.<br>
•	Assuring that the information remains intact - i.e., that the integrity of the information is conserved.<br>
•	Restricting the information distribution to authorized persons only -i.e., maintaining the confidentiality of the information.<br>
•	Tracking the information along its lifecycle, in order to obtain a clear understanding of the information flow and to allow for adequate information retention practice.<br>
Information assets in organizations and businesses evolve dynamically following their creation. During the evolution process, additional information and knowledge are created; added; destroyed; formats change; names change, etc. The process may have one, several or numerous contributors. Managing the information distribution along its lifecycle is therefore an involved task. In some cases, the information is relevant only within a limited time-window, and the value of the information sharply decreases after some time. E.g., the information that is relevant for predicting the price of a certain commodity at a certain time, becomes steadily less valuable as the time gets closer. In other cases, the information represents accumulated knowledge. In this case, the merit of the information may even increases with time. This state of affairs further complicates the information-management task.<br>
Methods that attempt to track digital information and manage information distribution exist. Some of these methods utilize file meta-data, which may not be robust against changes in the file format Other methods utilize keywords-based classification, which tends to be either over-exclusive or over-inclusive. Other methods restrict information usage and distribution to particular kinds of applications, commonly referred to as Digital Right Management (DRM) applications. DRM applications have the disadvantage that they hamper normal workflow and require large to massive investment levels. Still other methods consider the binary signature of the File, but this has the disadvantage of depending critically on the precise representation of the data.<br>
The above methods thus do not provide an adequate solution to the<br><br>
problem of modern businesses for the reasons outlined above. The large number of formats in which the same information caft be represented, the large number of applications that can use the same information in different ways; the large numbers of kinds of storage that the information can be kept in, and the large number of information distribution channels types, tend to render any given method ineffective over a business environment taken as a whole. File metadata is often altered when the format of the file or the storage medium of the data is changed. Binary digital signature is of zero-tolerance to any changes in the signed data, and keyword or key-phrase based tracking cover only a very limited aspect of the problem.<br>
Methods for screening and filtering of digital content also exist and are widely used, in order, for example, to allow censorship of offending material (e.g., pornography). These methods lack the resolution needed for effective policy definition and enforcement, and tend to be over exclusive or over inclusive,<br>
Methods that utilize sophisticated searching algorithms in databases and over the Internet also exist. These methods are optimized for information retrieval and for providing answers to specific queries, and, in general, cannot provide either for effective tracking of specific information items or for effective policy enforcement.<br>
Another issue that further complicates the monitoring process is the so-called template document. In many cases, documents are derived from template type source documents, for example standard contracts. In these cases, the ability to monitor and track various different documents that are derived from the same or a similar source template cannot be based on any naive notion of resemblance between the documents, since two documents that are derived from the same / similar template may be, on one hand, very similar, while, on the other hand, the differentiating details, such as the names of the sides of the contract may be of considerable importance. Tracking different derivatives of a template document is not adequately addressed by current methods.<br>
There is thus a recognized need for, and it would be highly advantageous to have, a method and system that allow information tracking and information distribution management along the information life cycle, which overcomes the drawbacks of current methods as described above.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to a first aspect of the present invention, a method and a system for information management and control is presented, based on modular and abstract description of the information. The system allows for a flexible and efficient policy management and enforcement, where a policy can be defined with direct respect to the actual information content of the digital data items. The information content can be of various kinds: e.g., textual documents, numerical spreadsheets, audio and video files, pictures and images, drawings etc. The system can provide protection against information policy breaches such as information misuse, unauthorized distribution and leakage, and for information tracking.<br>
As a first step in practicing the invention, elementary information units are defined. These elementary information units may be sentences, sequences of words, sequences of characters, numbers, graphs, vectors, matrices, pieces of raw data, images, etc. The system then assigns representation-independent identifiers and indices for each elementary information unit An information object that consists of one or more information units is thereafter defined by the system. For example, a textual document can be considered as an information object, and various sequences of words are considered as the basic information units. Within the context of this invention, an information object is the basic ingredient on which a policy is defined. A simple information object is an information object that can be described as a concatenation of one or more basic information units, while a compound information object is an information object that consists of two or more simple information objects, possibly together with the information needed for their combination (e.g., a textual document with an embedded numeric worksheet). An information class is the set of all information objects on which precisely the same policy is defined. An instance of an information object is a specific representation of the information object, e.g., an instance of the information object describes a certain text may be a file that contains the said text in a MS-Word format.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, -the information evolution process is preferably described by a directed graph, where the nodes in the graph represents information objects, and two nodes are connected by a<br><br>
vertex if and only if one of the two nodes share a fraction of basic information units that is greater then a certain threshold.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the system monitors and/or controls the traffic in computer networks, the access to and storage of information in storage elements and the usage of information by applications and their users, in order to identify and/or classify information objects and to assign or enforce a policy in accordance with the content of the information objects. The policy may contain one or more restrictions on the usage of the information object.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the system extracts a descriptor for each information object, based on statistical analysis of the information objects.<br>

In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the defined policy also includes replacing some of the content with other content.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, the identifiers depend only on the content of the elementary information units, and not on their location in the information object.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the identifiers of the basic information units and the information objects are stored in a database.<br><br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the information objects are clustered according to their relative distances, and a default policy is assigned to each cluster.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the distance between the information objects is an edit distance, described, e.g., in U. Manber: Introduction To Algorithms: a Creative Approach, pp 155-158, Addison-Wesley publishing company, 1989, ISBN 0-201-12037-2, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. In this case, the elementary symbols used for evaluating the edit distance are information units.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the distances between identifiers of the elementary information units takes into consideration their semantic differences, such that if two elementary information units has the same semantic meaning, their identifiers will be the same.<br>

In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the system attempt to capture and analyze files transferred via instant messaging services. This is done by analyzing the file transfer message sent by the instant messaging server, locating the address (e.g., IP address) and relaying the transport on behalf of the participant that send the file.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the system constructs default groups based on content identification. The groups are preferably constructed based on former usage involving information objects with similar characteristics.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the system utilizes methods that are resilient to deliberate attempts to change the apparent content of the information, by creating identifiers that are invariant to at least some of the transformations in the information objects.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the system contains a module operable to detect cases in which the information object has been subjected to manipulation in order to avoid its detection, classification or identification.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the system contains a module operable to handle various documents that are derived from the same templates (e.g., standard contacts). The template documents are stored in a special database as information objects. Each document that is derived from a given template document is treated as a compound information object, that is it comprises template information and structure from the template information object as well as one or more information objects that represent the additions or changes from the basic template document. The template information object preferably contains the minimal number of elementary information units that are presented in all the documents that are derived from the said template.<br>

The various unique identifiers of the information units are preferably stored in a database. The order in which the identifiers are presented in the document can also be stored, in order to allow for better detection and identification.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the policy can be defined in a manner that allows a user to view / access / manipulate / copy / transfer / print only selected information objects that are parts of the compound information object. In this case, the system preferably utilizes a mechanism that enables to maintain the coherency of the text.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the system utilizes identification methods based on the edit distance between information objects, where the basic sequence on which the edit distance is evaluated is a subset of the sequence of identifiers of the elementary information units<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the number of identifiers of the elementary information units is reduced by performing a random filtering or other filtering method.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the identification is based on a list of salient words or elementary units, that are selected in a manner that ensures that every portion of the text that is larger then a certain threshold is covered, i.e., contain at least one word from the list.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, the system scans for pre-designated information objects in storage devices, such as the user's hard-disks, by utilizing client software.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention a method and a system for knowledge management and control is presented, based on modular and abstract description of knowledge. In this case, the elementary units are denoted as facts. As a first step in practicing the invention, elementary facts (EF) are defined.<br><br>
These elementary facts may be represented as sentences (e.g., "Mr. John Doe earned 65000$ in 2001"), as entries to a database etc. The system theft assigns representation-independent identifiers and indices for each elementary fact. A knowledge object consisting of one or more facts is thereafter defined by the system. For example, a set of facts about Mr. John Doe can be considered as a knowledge object. Within the context of this aspect of the present invention, a knowledge object is the basic ingredient on which a policy is defined. A simple knowledge object is a knowledge object that can be fully described as a set of elementary facts, while a compound knowledge object is a knowledge object that consists of two or more simple knowledge objects. A knowledge class is the set of all knowledge objects on which precisely the same policy is defined. An instance of a knowledge object is a specific representation of the knowledge<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, the system allows authorized persons to override any automatic decision of the system.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, a personalized watermark is added to any instance of the information objects while being distributed to the various recipients.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present embodiments describe a method and system for managing confidential information. In particular, the present invention described methods for information tracking, identification, classification and management along the information Lifecycle, utilizing a modular and abstract description of information.<br>
According to embodiments, a system for information management and control  is presented which uses modular and abstract descriptions of the<br><br>
information. The system allows foj flexible and efficient policy management and enforcement, in which a policy can be defined with direct respect to the actual information content of the digital information items. The information content can be of various kinds: e.g., textual documents, numerical spreadsheets, audio and video files, pictures and images, drawings etc. The system can provide protection against information leakage independently of other information management systems.<br>
Before  explaining  in  detail preferred  embodiments  of the present invention, the following terminology and nomenclature are introduced:<br>
•	Canonization: transformation of digital data into a standard format. E.g., transforming of textual documents in various formats to plain text in a Unicode format. In order to be able to infer information regardless of the format, it is preferable to canonize the input data.<br>
•	An elementary information unit (EIU) is a piece of (preferably canonized) information to which a unique identifier is assigned. These elementary information units may be sentences, sequences of words, sequences of characters, sequences of frames in a video content, segments of audio files etc.<br>
•	An information object (IO) consists of one or more information units. For example, a textual document can be considered as an information object, and various sequences of words are considered as the basic information units. Within the context of this invention, an information object is the basic ingredient on which a policy may be defined.<br>
•	A simple information object (SIO) is an information object that can be fully described as a concatenation of basic information units (possibly with overlaps). For example, a paragraph in a textual document, a drawing or a "cut" in a film can be considered as a simple information object.<br>
•	A compound information object (CIO) is an information object that consists of an aggregation of two or more information objects (e.g., a textual document with an embedded numeric worksheet), together with- the  information that is  needed for their  combination.  The<br><br>
aggregation can be hierarchical: a compound information object can be constructed by an aggregation of other compound information objects, which in turn are constructed by an aggregation of other compound information objects, etc.<br>
•	An information class is the set of all information objects on which precisely the same policy is defined.<br>
•	An instance of an information object is a specific representation of an information object, e.g., a file that contains a certain textual document in a MS-Word format.<br>

Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. In addition, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 1, which is a simplified schematic diagram illustrating a compound information object comprising lower-level information entities according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The compound information object 110 comprises three simple information objects: 120, 122 and 124, and further uses auxiliary information 130. Each simple information object in turn comprises a concatenation of elementary information objects (140,142 and 144).<br>
The information evolution process is preferably described by a directed graph, where the nodes in the graph represent information objects. Figure 2 illustrates the notation for constructing a directed edge in the graph. If the information object a 210 contain all the elementary information units that exists in the information object b 212, then the node a will be connected to the node b with an edge directed from a to b (Fig 2a) and vice versa (Fig 2b). If the two nodes share a fraction of elementary information units that is greater then a certain threshold then a vertex connects the two nodes is described by a bidirectional edge. (Fig 2c)Figure 3 is a simplified graphical representation showing an evolutionary process of an original information object X 310. From an original information object X 310 two versions, XI 320 and X2 330 are derived. These versions are subsets of the original object, and there is therefore an edge directed from X 310 to XI 320 and X2 330. XI 320 and X2 330 share a substantial quantity of elementary information units, and there is therefore a bidirectional edge between XI 320 and X2 330. From XI two basic versions are derived, XI, 1 340 and XI.2 345, and there is therefore an edge directed from XI 320 to X 1.1 340 and to XI.2 345. The derivations, again, share a substantial<br><br>
amount of elementary information units, so there is another bi-directional edge between Xl.l 340 and X1.2 345. X1.3 350, and XI.4, 355, are versions of Xl.l 340 and X1.2 345, respectively, but instead of being merely subsets of Xl.l 340 and X1.2 345, they also contain additional information units, which are not presented in Xl.l 340 and XI.2 345. There is therefore a bi-directional edge between Xl.l 340 and X1.3 350, and a bi-directional edge between Xl.l 340 and X1.3 350, Similarly, X1.5 360 is a version of XI.3 350. In this case, some information units have been subtracted and some information units have been added. X2.1 370 is derived from X2 330, and contains a subset of the elementary information units of X2 330, and there is therefore an edge directed from X2 330 to X2.1 370. X2.1.1 380 is in turn derived from X2.1 370. X2.1.1 380 again, contains only a subset of the information units of the object from which it derives, and there is therefore an edge directed from X2.1 370 to X2.1.1 380. Note that in order to provide robustness, the description of an infoimation object in terms of basic information units contains, in general, a high level of redundancy, and there should preferably be provided a considerable overlap between elementary information units that are used to describe an information object: e.g., if the information object is a "cut" of a video content, the elementary information units may be overlapping sequences of frames. Reference is now made to Fig. 4 which is a simplified diagram schematically illustrating such a state of affairs: an information object 400 is composed of the elements a 410, b 412, c, 414, d, 416, e, 418, and/ 420. These elements can be words in a text object, frames in a video objects etc. The elementary information units are sequences of elements: the elementary information unit SI 430 comprises the sequence a 410, b 412 and c, 414, the elementary information unit S2 432 comprises the sequence b 412, c 414 and d, 416, the elementary information unit S3 434 comprises the sequence c 414, d 416, and e 418 and the elementary information unit S4 436 comprises the sequence d 416, e 418 and / 420. The information object can therefore be described as a simple concatenation of SI 430 and S4 436.<br>
A policy with respect to a compound information object may also be compound, such that a different policy will be assigned to each of the simple objects that constitute the compound information object. For example, one simple information object from the set of information objects that constitutes<br><br>
the compound information object may be classified "confidential", while another information object may be classified as "public".<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 5, which illustrates one-to-one correspondence between information objects and policies, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Compound information object 500 contains the simple information object A 510, to which policy X 512 applies, the simple information object B 520, to which the policy Y 522 applies, and the simple information object C 530, to which the policy Z 532 applies. It is noted that a policy may comprise ignoring a given object, or may include any kind of default behavior. The policy can therefore also be defined as a property of the information object. The policy can be a simple rule (e.g., "can be viewed only by X, Y, and Z") or a complete set of rules, determining restriction on the usage imposed on the various members in the organization.<br>
Such rule based policy may be group or logic based, attaching a complete policy or a policy element (i.e., a directive which is a part of a policy) to a Boolean expression, such that the policy or policy element is enforced on all transactions which satisfy the expression. This expression may be composed of variables whose value is determined by outside Boolean functions (such as membership in a group, time based functions, etc.). An equivalent implementation may be based on group membership. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, some of the expressions are defined as lazy expressions, and are not evaluated as soon as it gets bound to a variable, but only when something forces the evaluator to produce the expression's value. The latter allows for a more efficient implementation.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, a language, resembling a programming or scripting language, is used to define an ordered calculation that results in a policy. The ordered calculation may directly result from the language, or may be inferred from a hierarchy of calculation dependencies.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a policy is assigned to selected nodes in the graph, and nodes may inherit the policies assigned to their predecessors.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, a notion of distance   or   similarity/dissimilarity   is   defined   between   any   two   of the<br><br>
information objects. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the similarity measure between information object A and information object B is based on the parts that are common between the two objects. For example, if the information obj ect A is described by 400 elementary information units, and the information object B is described by 500 elementary information units, out of which 300 elementary information units are common to A and B, then the similarity between A and B is 300/400= 0.75, and the similarity between B and A is 300/500= 0.6.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the system utilizes an identification method based on the edit distance (described, e.g., in Manber referred to above) between information objects, where the basic sequences on which the edit distance is evaluated are sequences of identifiers of the elementary information units. For example, if the identifiers of one sequence are A B C and D and the identifiers of the second sequence are A B E C D, then the distance is "1 insert".<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the distances between identifiers of the elementary information units take into consideration their semantic differences, such that if two elementary information units have the same semantic meaning, then the two elementary objects share the same identifier. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention considering of semantic content is performed by mapping all synonymous words to the same numerical identifier, such that replacing a word with its synonym would not alter the numerical representation of the word. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the identifiers of elementary information units are invariant also to reordering of words.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, identifiers are based on embedding the elementary information units in a Euclidean space in a manner that approximately preserves the pairwise semantic distances between the elementary information units. The embedding process can utilize a method such as the one described in N. Linial, , Y. Rabinovich: The Geometry of Graphs and Some of its Algorithmic Applications. Combinatorica 15(2): 215-245,1995, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, ' the information objects are clustered, using a clustering method that utilizes the<br><br>
pair-wise distances, or any other, dissimilarity measure, between information objects. In this case, users may assign a policy to one or more representative objects in each cluster, and a default policy is assigned to all the objects in the cluster based on the policy assigned to the representative objects. This method can be used for automatic creation of default groups. Methods for clustering using a measure of similarity and/or dissimilarity between pairs of objects or for clustering of nodes in a directed graph, such as the graph depicted in figure 2, are known and described e.g., in R. O. Duda, P. E. Hart and D. G. Stork: Pattern Classification (2nd Edition), John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 2001, ISBN 0-471-05669-3, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention a default policy is assigned to information objects according to the policy assigned to its neighbors, e.g., using the "n nearest-neighbors rule" described, e.g., in Duda et al referred to above. This requires defining a measure of similarity/dissimilarity between information objects, e.g., using the similarity/dissimilarity measure described above.<br>
An information closure is a clique in the graph, i.e., a group of nodes such that each node is connected to all the other members in the group. Because of the similarity within an information closure, it is likely that the policies regarding its constituents are similar or even equal. Furthermore, it is also likely that exact identification of a document as being similar to a single node in the clique may be a relatively hard task. Therefore, in another preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is an option to define a default policy for the clique to be applied to any case where an information item has been identified to be part of the clique but cannot be matched to any single node. Such a default policy may be defined explicitly, or implicitly based on the common ground of the policies defined for the individual clique nodes.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the system extracts a descriptor for each information object, based on a series of unique identifiers for each elementary information unit. The extracted identifiers can be based on a hash function derived from a numerical representation of the elementary information unit. Thus, in a case in which information units are textual, a numeric representation of the text can be based on the ASCII or Unicode representation of the characters.<br><br>
In another aspect of the present invention, the identifiers depend only on the content of the elementary information units, and not on their order or location in the information object.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the identifiers of the basic information units and the information objects are stored in a database, in a manner that allows efficient retrieval. This way, the system can efficiently utilize the identifiers in order to compare stored identifiers with identifiers of the analyzed objects.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the system monitor the traffic in computer networks and possibly also via fax servers and fax machines, in order to identify and /or classify information objects and to assign or enforce a policy in accordance with the content of the information objects. The policy may contain restrictions on the usage, integrity and distribution of the information object.<br>
Reference is now made to Figure 6, which is a simplified block diagram illustrating a basic network and showing monitoring units distributed around the network, to allow for basic network monitoring according to preferred embodiment of the present invention. Digital content containing information objects resides on designated directories in a file system 602, and a policy 603 is assigned thereto as follows: a certain initial policy is assigned to each information object - either explicitly or implicitly, implicitly meaning a default policy. The file system 602 may resides on a dedicated server or on networked computers belonging to the network users. The information object identifier 604 may scans the directories and extract identifiers from the information objects in the various files. The identifiers are thereafter stored in the identifier database 606. When a user 607 subsequently attempts to disseminate.digital content via the organizational mail server 608, organizational mail server monitoring unit 610 obtains the message and its attachments and utilizes information object identifier 612 in order to identify the information objects in the transport. The information object identifier 612 in turn utilizes the identifier database 606 in order to detect information objects to which a policy has previously been assigned. Results of the above-described detection process are sent to the policy reference monitor 632 of the central control unit 630. The policy reference monitor instructs the organizational mail-server monitoring unit 610 whether to<br><br>
. allow transmission of the inspected mail, based on the results. Thus, for example, if the transport is being sent to an address outside the immediate organization, and an object is found within the transport having' a policy indicating that it should not be distributed outside the organization, then the transport is stopped.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, as well as blocking the transport, or as an alternative thereto, the organizational mail-server monitoring unit 610 may, notify the user and/or the administrator about dissemination attempts that do not comply with the assigned policy and/or about suspected traffic. A substantially similar process may be applied to data dissemination via an SMTP proxy 614, HTTP proxy 620 and fax server 634. In these latter cases, the respective monitoring units: the SMTP proxy monitoring unit 616, the HTTP proxy monitoring unit 622 and the fax monitoring unit 636 obtain content information of the transport and utilize the respective information object identifiers 618, 624 and 638 in order to identify the information objects in the transport. Monitoring fax traffic can be performed, e.g., using the method described in US provisional patent application 60/450,336 "A Method and System for Preventing Information Leakage via Fax Machines", filed February 28th 2003, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the central control unit 630 also plays a part in enforcement of policy, that is to say in transport blocking. In particular the central control unit controls traffic passing the WAN gateway 640 and can be used to prevent a particular transport from passing outwardly via gateway 640.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig 7, which is a chart illustrating a method for extraction of identifiers from an instance of an information object, constructed and operative according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The input to the method is an information object instance 710 such as a file that contain a MS-word document. The instance is subjected to a pre-i processing stage 720, which includes identification of the format or type 722 (e.g., identification of the file format as a MS-Word file), instance opening 724 (e.g., file opening) and canonization 726. Canonization may for example comprise transforming the MS-Word file to plain Unicode text. The result is a canonized information object 730. From the canonized information object 730.<br><br>
one or more identifiers are then extracted 740 and are stored in an identifiers<br>
"*? • database 750, preferably together with the corresponding policy.<br>
Fig. 8 illustrates a system and method for identification of an information object instance wherein after the identifiers of information objects are extracted and are stored in a database 750 together with their assigned policy - the system attempts to identify similar information objects within the digital traffic and /or within storage devices, in order to enforce the assigned policies.: as in the method described is figure 7 the inspected information object instance 710 is subjected to pre-processing 720. a canonized information object 730 is formed and identifiers are extracted 740. The extracted identifiers 742 are used for classification and identification by a classification and identification module 810. The classification and identification module 810 utilizes an identifier comparator 812 in order to compare say, existing identifiers from identifiers database 750 with the extracted identifiers 742.<br>
After evaluating the results a decision 820 regarding the identification of the information object is made. Based on this decision, a policy with respect to the inspected information object is enforced: e.g., if the decision is that the inspected information object 710 is substantially equivalent to another information object, to which its assigned policy limits its distribution to a certain users group in the organization, then attempts to disseminate information object outside the group should be blocked and reported. The notion of similarity may for example be based on the relative number of elementary information units that exists in both information objects, as explained above. The notion of "substantially equivalent" involve some subjective aspects, and it is therefore preferable that the threshold for similarity is tunable, so that a given organization can set the threshold after observing impacts of several threshold levels on "false positive" and "false negative" rates within its information traffic.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig 9 which is a simplified flow diagram illustrating a method for policy enforcement with respect to information object instances, constructed and operative according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Parts that are the same as in previous figures are given the same reference numerals and are not referred to again except as necessary for<br><br>
understanding the present embodiment. The inspected information object instance 710 forms a first entity, and successful identification thereof is indicated by stage (A) 910. Subsequently, the policy assigned to the'identified information object is resolved, as indicated by stage (B) 920. Subsequently, the relevant components in the system are instructed to enforce the policy thus identified, in a third stage (C), 930. For example, the SMTP server may be instructed to block the transmission of the information object instance. Subsequently, reports are sent to the relevant entities or persons, for example to the system administrator and the sender in a stage (D) 940, and finally the full details of the event, which may include sender and recipients identities, information object identifier, time and date etc. are logged in stage (E), indicated by reference numeral 950.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, frequent and/or non-salient items (common and frequent words carrying little content-specific information) are removed from the canonized information object before the extraction of identifiers, in order to promote the efficiency and the robustness of the identification process.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the limitations on the usage of the information object comprise limitations to at least one of the following:<br>
viewing the information object;<br>
editing the information object;<br>
transferring the information object;<br>
storing the information object;<br>
printing the information object;<br>
changing the representation of the information object;<br>
changing the properties of the information object;<br>
changing the format of the information object;<br>
copying portions of the information object;<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the limitation on the usage is application specific, i.e., the system allows usage of a specific information   object   only   by   one   specific   application   or   some   specific<br>
applications.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the limitation on the<br><br>
usage is operation-system specific, i.e., the system allows usage 6fa specific information object only by a specific operation system or operation systems.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the limitation on the usage is user specific, i.e., the system allows usage of a specific information object only by a specific user or users.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, restrictions on editing, such as restrictions on copying, cut &amp; paste, etc., may be imposed in document-specific manner, i.e., the system may allow editing of a certain document and yet prevent editing with others. Yet again it may prevent copying of information objects from one document to another, whilst permitting within the document itself.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, defined policies may nclude adding forensic information to an information object. This can be achieved by altering parts of the information object in a manner that is preferably substantially imperceptible, as described in PCT application number IL02/00464, filed June 16th, 2002 the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the defined policy also includes replacing some of the content with other content in one or more of the copies of the original content. E.g.:<br>
•	Classified paragraphs in a document can be replaced by un<br>
classified paragraphs, or by null or contentless paragraphs,<br>
rendering the document unclassified.<br>
•	Paragraphs may be added or removed according to the needs of<br>
the recipients, in order to construct a customized document.<br>
In these cases, the system preferably utilizes a mechanism that enables maintaining the coherency of the text taking into account linguistic considerations. In order to render the changes as seamless as possible, the system preferably also.preserves the structure of the information object, the formatting style of the information object and the pagination style of the information object. In order to achieve that the spaces between words and lines and the page margins can be manipulated by the system in a manner that is substantially unnoticeable.<br>
In   another   preferred   embodiment  of the   present   invention,   the<br><br>
^information is inspected in one or several locations within a computer data network. Several kinds of traffic may be monitored, including instant messengers, mail, web, file transfer protocols, chat protocols (e.g. IRC) etc.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, monitoring is preformed using sniffing. In the sniffing embodiment, at least one listening node exists on the communication network and messages are analyzed on transit, in a manner analogous to wiretapping. Using sniffing, it can be that the information is already transferred when a breach of policy is detected. It is however possible to detect, monitor, log and alert regarding the illicit transfer, and it is often possible to stop it at midpoint, mitigating some of the damage. Implementing this method, different protocols need to be processed differently, utilizing e.g.. the methods described in US patent application number 10/003,269 and PCT application number IL02/00037, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference, as the traffic may contain a mix of protocols.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, monitoring is performed using traffic forwarding. In traffic forwarding, a node through which the traffic passes monitors the traffic in a manner similar to sniffing as described above. However, the traffic is allowed to pass through the node only if and when the monitoring indicates that the traffic is authorized. Traffic may also be altered for example by deleting an attachment, removing sensitive information, adding a disclaimer, etc. Altering in this manner is advantageous in that it allows for a more versatile and robust policy enforcement. In traffic monitoring, as for sniffing, different protocols need to be processed differently, as described in US patent application number 10/003,269 and PCT application number IL02/00037, as the traffic may contain a mix of protocols. A router, gateway or firewall is usually used as the forwarding node.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, monitoring is performed utilizing a Proxy server. The proxy server method is similar to traffic forwarding, however, instead of monitoring all traffic, specific kinds of ► traffic are required to pass through a specialized proxy .server. Preferably a firewall is used to block any and all attempts to bypass the proxy servers. Several established proxy protocols and technologies exists (e.g. HTTP proxying and SOCKS) which make it easier for these kinds of servers to interface outside systems. The SOCKS protocol is specifically designed for<br><br>
secure TCP proxying in a sensitive environment. Thus the proxy server method utilizes established support for these methods. The metliod has the ability to monitor, block, and alter traffic, and yet complexity is reduced since it selects the traffic it wishes to monitor.<br>
The ability to alter traffic is useful in cases where it is needed to force a specific route for traffic (e.g. a proxy), or other behavior, and where uncontrollable software or a protocol takes a different route. In such a case it is possible to alter a field or fields in the controlling traffic, thus changing the behavior of the software. Such is often the case in instant messenger software, which generally attempts its own peer-to-peer connection. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the system analyzes the file transfer message sent by the instant messaging server, locates the address (e.g., IP address) and relays the transport on behalf of the participant that sends the file. Using this method, the system has access to the content of the relayed file, which allows the system to analyze the content and to apply the required policy.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the system utilizes a method of detecting deliberate attempts to change the apparent content of the information, by creating identifiers that are invariant to at least some of the transformations in the information objects.<br>
For example, consider a spreadsheet table with m rows and n columns. Denote by Xij the variables in the table; where i denote the index of the row and j denotes the index of the column, the identifier of the original file is comprised of the 3(m+n+l) numbers:<br><br><br>
Denote by Yy the variables in the examined table, with m' rows and n' columns, the identification signature of this table comprised of the 3(m'+n'+l) numbers:<br>
i = L.m'J = l..n'<br>
A comparison scheme is described, using the simple case in which m = m' and n=n', that is robust against permutations of the elements of the table and against linear transformation that is applied to all the elements. For example it may multiply all the elements by a constant, or may add a constant to all the elements, or both. The scheme is described by the following algorithm:<br>
Algorithm:<br>
Define tolerance variables s}, s2 and <fr3></fr3>
Assign: equal = 0;<br>
Evaluate:<br>
A,= \{X)-(Y)\ A2=  \(X2)-(Y2) A3 =  \(X3)-(Y3)if A, 
Else //check for linear relation of the form y = ax +b<br><br>
Evaluate:<br>
b' = (Y)-a'(X)<br>
&amp; = (¥*)-a* {Xz)-~3a'1b'{X1)-?&gt;a,b'2(X)~b*<br>
if A' 
End<br>
End End<br>
The above algorithm does not depend on the order of the elements in the table, and is robust to linear transformation that may occur, e.g., while transforming financial data from dollars to Euros.<br>
In order to provide further robustness against cases in which only some of the rows or columns exists in the analyzed table, a similar comparison is also performed with respect to statistical moments of each row and column. The matches are counted and if the number of matched column or matched rows is greater then a certain threshold, an equal flag is set to "1". The threshold can be set according to specific needs which may stem from the sensitivity of the data and the tolerated level of false alarms.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the system identifies graphical information objects, e.g., drawings, utilizing computerized image-matching techniques, described, in L.G.

In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, graphical information objects are identified by extracting key features of the objects, such as lines and their orientation, relationships between components, shapes, color and/or intensity distribution etc.<br><br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, preprocessing takes place on the images in order to facilitate the identification technique, such as canonizing the size and color, reducing noise, scene detection, canonizing size, canonizing orientation, canonizing color, removing color, reducing noise, enhancing area separation, enhancing borders, enhancing lines, sharpening, blurring etc.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, there exist several indices and/or identification systems, such that the resolution and accuracy of identification differ between the indices and/or identification systems. For example, one system may be very robust but provide a low resolution, another provide high resolution with lower reliability, and a third one provide high resolution, reliability, robustness and accuracy at the cost of high resource use.<br>
The present embodiment may provide several advantages including the following:<br>
■ The ability to pinpoint a closely related segment, by using a very accurate index, but to achieve robustness and reliability with another index, and speed with yet another one. In most cases the same basic algorithm can be used, but with different parameters, options and thresholds. Several such options for selection of descriptors, preprocessing, and other such options are described below (e.g. descriptors resistant to manipulation and permutation). The ability to rely upon locality of similarity in order to increase reliability. Such ability can be achieved by increasing selection of required high thresholds for general similarity, but then calculating a new threshold based on the size of the portion of the document that contains the already found similarity. Now study of the localized similarity requires a lower threshold. A suitable threshold calculation may use a monotonically increasing function of a size, such that the percentage of similarity is lower for localized similarity. For example, a percentage based threshold function, based on the locality size (i.e., the size of the area in which similarity was found to be localized) in percentage, where for localized similarity over a given minimal  percentage linearly<br><br>
increases up to a maximal percentage where there is no significant localization of similarity (L^the locality size is 100%). For example: X is the percentage of the similarity area out of the whole document (X=L/D where L is the size of the similarity area, and D is the size of the document), Y is the threshold in percentage terms of the document (Y=S/D whfere S is the similarity within L), so Y=max(0.2,X/2).<br>
■ Increasing speed and accuracy of detection, by using a series of increasingly accurate indices on the suspect list as produced in the previous stage each time. Thus the suspect list shortens after each index.In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the system contains a module operable to detect cases in which the information object has been subjected to manipulation in order to avoid its detection, classification or identification. Thus, for example, for a manipulation that comprises permutation of some of the words, one may use two type descriptors: one that is not sensitive to the order of the words, and one that is sensitive. The system can thereafter identify the content utilizing the type of descriptors that is not sensitive to the order of the words (e.g., histograms of the frequencies of the various words), and thereby determine to a certain level of probability the fact that the word has been subjected to permutations utilizing order-sensitive type descriptors. In cases where the manipulation comprises replacing characters with other characters, for example some kind of substitution or transposition cipher, the resulting content may include many words that are not real words, and are therefore not included in dictionaries. The analyzer can easily detect such a state, label the content as "suspected" and transfer the suspected content for a more thorough (possibly manual) analysis.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the analyzer uses one or more of the following criteria for determining the plausibility that a certain document was subjected to manipulation in order to avoid detection:<br>
•	Irregular word distribution patterns including the presence of unknown words, and disproportionate lack of common words.<br>
•	Irregular distribution of characters.<br>
-•     Alphabetic characters mixed with non-alphabetic and numeric<br><br>
characters in words, thus Microvolt, I_,UUK, lamp, wnicn are changes that might be believed to fool monitoring software.<br>
•	Irregular distribution of word lengths, especially large proportions of long words, or all words being of uniform length.<br>
•	Files which do not appearto be of the claimed-format, thus appearing to be unopenable, for example a text file which starts with a zip header.<br>
•	Encryption, or any other kind of encoding.<br>
•	Incompatibility with expected punctuation and capitalization rules, such as apparently ending a paragraph in mid sentence.<br>
•	Disproportionate number of spelling mistakes, especially in<br>
applications that allow spell-checking.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the system contains a module operable to handle various documents that are derived from the same template (e.g., standard contacts). The template documents are stored in a special database as information objects. Each document that is derived from a template document is a compound information object, comprising the template information object and one or more additional information objects representing the added material or the differences from the basic template document. The template information object preferably contains the minimal number of elementary information units that are presented in all the documents that are derived from the said template.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, templates are considered as a special kind of Information object. The template information object comprises a sequence of information units, similarly to simple information objects, but the sequence also contains another kind of element, dubbed a placeholder. Placeholders may be generic, which is to say that they contain another sequence of information units, which may also contain embedded information objects, Alternatively the placeholders may be specialized. Thus in a form or like document a placeholder may contain a number, a name, or the like. Placeholders are useful for enhancing identification accuracy. Because the content of the placeholders is expected to change in different instances of the template, their content is not part of the'template itself,<br><br>
thus, they provide cledr„ internal boundaries for the template<br>
Some examples of document templates are standard disclaimers or headers, contracts, forms etc.<br>
Templates can be filled with other information objects, a process defined as instantiation. Instantiation consists of replacing the placeholders with appropriate information objects. The result of this instantiation is another information object, which may have its own instances, i.e. appear in specific formats.<br>
Templates can be defined in two ways: manual and automatic, as follows.<br>
In manual definition, the templates are explicitly defined. By its very nature, manual definition specifies the exact intention of the person doing the definition, albeit at the price of requiring his or her time and attention . Manual definition is ideally the common method, and is especially useful for forms and standard contracts, but is also quite useful for disclaimers, headers, footers, etc. One of the main advantages of manual definition is the relative simplicity of providing explicit definitions for placeholders. That is to say the user actively defines the placeholders. It will be appreciated that placeholders are optional, meaning that templates are not required to have placeholders, but they are an integral part of the template definition when they are provided. Another advantage of manual definition is the perfect precision that is possible therewith. The person carrying out the definition can label or annotate the placeholder as desired, for example by identifying the type of information that is intended to be inserted at that point. In short, placeholders can readily be identified by the person doing the definition and can be explicitly defined, and an advantage of having placeholders is that they make it easier to identify passing information as being an instance of a given template and a difference or delta. The better defined the placeholders the easier it becomes to evaluate the deltas between the template and the instance. In the automatic mode, the system identifies substantially identical sections (identical information units) in different documents, by direct comparison or according to an index or other indirect method, and decides that they should be defined as template candidates. Manual intervention may be needed to approve, classify, or fine-tune the selection.    Automatic template definition is obviously easier from the user<br><br>
perspective, and may often be more accurate, especially when access to the full text of both documents or versions is possible. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, text matching and parsing is used in pinpointing the template.<br>
The introduction of these templates is useful to prevent false identification of differently classified documents that contain them, or when the templates themselves have different classification.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the system allows for declaring "ignored sections" - i.e., information objects and/or sets of elementary information units which the system can ignores while carrying out identification.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the system allows automatic classification of information according to a current domain of knowledge or to organizational departments (e.g., "legal", or "medical") utilizing keywords and clustering methods specific to the domain. Knowing about the specific domain allows a more sophisticated policy assignment.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the system allows for a default policy to be applied on information objects to which no previous policy has been defined. The policy is preferably also based on the domain of knowledge to which the said object belongs.<br>
The various unique identifiers of the information units are preferably stored in a database. The order in which the identifiers are presented in the original information object can also be stored, in order to allow for a better detection.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the policy can be defined in a manner that allows a given user to view only selected information objects that are parts of a current compound information object. Since policy can be assigned to each information object, and since the policy can specify who may view the particular information object, this feature can be readily implemented. In this case, the system preferably utilizes a mechanism that enables maintaining of the coherency of the text, taking into account linguistic considerations.<br>
In another prefen'ed embodiment of the present invention, the number of the identifiers of the elementary information units is reduced by performing random filtering, for example disregarding all the identifiers which end in "0? <br>
or other filtering methods, in order to reduce computational and memory resources. Reducing the number of identifier may reduce the redundancy level and the robustness level, and an optimal reduction should therefore be derived as a trade-off between the allocated resources and the required robustness level.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, identification may be based on a list of salient words and their respective distances, that are selected in a manner that assure that every portion of the text that is larger than a certain threshold (e.g., 10 words) contains at least one word from the list. The salient words are preferably not common and should convey distinctive power that enables identification of the information object.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, the system allows authorized persons to override automatic decisions of the. system, in order to handle cases of miss-identification or exceptional cases, preferably using a specialized utility activated from the user interface. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the system policy determines the scope of the system decisions that can be overridden by the various authorized persons in the organization. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, an override operation may require a high level of authentication on behalf of the authorized person.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the system performs extensive logging of all the events and operations performed on selected information objects along the information lifecycle. The events and operations are preferably stored in a database, and in an embodiment the identifier of the information object is used as the main index. This allows a better understanding of the genealogy of the information object, and provides a useful tool for information management. One can understand the various phases in the development of the information object and gain an understanding of the entire process that produced the object, regardless of the various file formats and the software applications (e.g., word processors) used.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the system enforces a policy regarding information objects with respect to edit actions, such as copying and cut &amp; paste, in a manner that allows performing of such actions only within a single document. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention this is achieved by monitoring the information held in the clipboard on   an   individual   computer   in   order   to   identify   information   objects.<br><br>
Identification of the objects then leads to enforcement of the associated policy<br>
using a software client installed in the individual computer.	'■'*'<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the system imports information regarding the organizational structure from organizational documents such as organization charts. The imported information is used in order to determine the default policy: e.g.:<br>
•	Definition of departments.<br>
•	Definition of working-groups.<br>
•	Hierarchies: e.g., if user X reports to user Y, then user Y has (at least) all the authorizations of user X.<br>
-   In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a graphical user ■ interface (GUI) is used in order to facilitate the transformation of organizational . structure and other organizational data into a policy regarding confidential information management.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 10a and 10b which are two diagrams that illustrate transformation of an organizational chart into a data-structure that allows   a  default   policy   to   be   defined.   Fig.   10a   illustrates   a   fictitious<br>
""PA A<br>
organizational chart, produced using " MS-Visio    " software, while Fig. 10b illustrates a data-structure in a MS-Excel format, derived automatically from the chart using the " MS-Visio™" software. From the data-structure a description of the members of the various departments and the organizational hierarchies can be derived, and the derivation can therefore support automatic definition of a default policy. A rule for defining a policy from such a data structure may be that if X reports to Y, then Y has at least all the permissions that X has, or that if both X and Z reports to Y, then X and Z are allow to freely communicate between   themselves   providing   that   they   include    ("CC")   Y    in   their correspondence.   Such rules can be added to the organizational policies and procedures, thereby facilitating the rapid formation of distribution policy. Reference is now made to Fig. 11, which is a simplified flowchart illustrating a method that allows for document classification, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The inputs, at stage A, indicated by 1110, consist of the following data:<br>
The document or the text itself<br><br>
•	The required level of similarity. This level can be represented in terms of percentages (e.g., "80% ") or a more qualitative terms ("high", "medium" and "low")<br>
•	Maximum number of results<br>
•	Other restrictions (e.g., creation and updating dates, formats, "containing specified text" etc.)<br>
The system thereafter extracts characteristics identified from the document, as explained above, in stage B 1120. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the characteristics are the numerical identifiers of the elementary information units, as explained above. The system then compares the characteristics with the identifiers database in stage C 1130, and then obtains the identities of documents with the required similarity level of their characteristics. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the similarity measure between document A and document B is based on the parts that are common between the two objects. For example, if document A is described by 400 elementary information units, and document B is described by 500 elementary information units, out of which 300 elementary information units are common to A and B, then the similarity between A and B is 300/400= 0.75, and the similarity between B and A is 300/500= 0.6. The ID may for example be a system ID number of the respective document. The Ids of documents having similar characteristics are obtained in stage 1140. The output, produced in stage E, indicated by 1150, consists of links and/or locations or paths to the matched documents, including the filename and preferably also a score indicating the level of matching.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 12, which is a simplified diagram that illustrates a system for document classification, according to preferred embodiment of the present invention. A user operates a user interface 1210 to provide relevant inputs 1212. These inputs may include:<br>
•	The document or the text itself<br>
•	The required level of similarity. This level can be represented in terms of percentages (e.g., "80% ") or a more qualitative terms ("high", "medium" and "low")<br>
•	Maximum number of results<br><br>
•    Other restrictions (e.g., creation and updating dates, formats,<br>
"containing specified text" etc.)	f<br>
The characteristics identified are extracted from the document by the identifiers extractor 1220, as explained above. The identifiers are then compared with the identifiers in the identifiers database 1230, resulting in a record 1240, that contain the identities and locations of the documents with the required similarity. The links and/or locations of the documents with the required similarity, preferably with the matching score, are then presented to the user 1214, within the user interface 1210.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 13, which is a simplified flowchart of a method for augmenting conditional access system by providing information-based clearance, according to a preferred embodiment of the present, invention. The system scans the file system for identifiable information items in stage A, indicated by 1310. The system thereafter attempts to identify information items in stage B, indicated by 1320 and evaluate the policy attached to the identified information items in stage C 1330. The policy attached to the information items is then compared with the conditional access policy, stage D 1340. For example a certain user is authorized to view a certain file, but the file may contain an information item that the user is not authorized to read. Thus there is a breach in the information usage policy. In such a case, action may be taken, stage E, indicated by 1350 - e.g., removing the restricted information item from the unauthorized domain, moving restricted information item to an authorized domain, notifying the owner and other relevant entities, logging the event, etc.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 14, which is a simplified diagram that ■illustrates a system for augmenting conditional access by providing information-based clearance, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Policy reference monitor 1410 instructs scanning and identifying module 1420 to scan the storage 1430 (e.g., a file system). In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the scanning and identifying module contain is a file-system crawler. The storage may, for example, contain a domain 1432 that is restricted to user group A and a domain 1434 that is restricted to user group B. The scanning and identifying module 1420 uses the identifier database 1440 in order to determine the identity of the analyzed information items. The identities of the analyzed information items, together<br><br>
with their respective policies, are stored in the document identities and policies database 1450. The resolved identity is then sent to the policy reference monitor 1410, which utilizes the document identities and policies database 1450 in order to resolve the corresponding policy. The policy reference monitor 1410 then instructs the policy enforcement module 1460 to apply the appropriate action, according to the resolved policy, on the file system 1430.<br>
Fig. 15 is a flowchart of a method for determining the integrity of an information object, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The system obtains as an input an information object instance in stage A, 1510, and extracts and stores an electronic signature of the instance in stage B, 1520. The signature is evaluated such that any change in the instance completely destroys the signature, so for example in a case in which the instance is a file, the signature can be a cryptographic hash of a binary representation of the file. The instance is then subjected to a pre-processing stage C, 1530, in order to reveal its information content. The system then extracts and stores the information object signature in stage D, 1540, and monitors and inspects the digital traffic according to a pre-defined policy in order to detect integrity breaches in stage E, 1550. In the case of a breach, the system performs the action determined by the pre-defined policy - for example it blocks the transport, notifies the owner, alerts the administrator, places the message in quarantine etc in a stage E, 1550.<br>
Fig. 16 illustrates a system for assuring the integrity of an information object, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. When a user A 1602 access an information item in classified information storage 1604, the access inspection and control module 1606 extract the integrity signature of the information item and send it to the reference monitor 1608. When User A 1602 attempts to send the information item to user B 1610 or to the manager 1616, the internal distribution inspection and control module 1612 and the integrity inspection module 1614 between them verify the integrity of the information item, and according to the policy dictated by the policy reference monitor 1608 determine whether to allow or to block the information transaction. Similarity, when either user B 1610 or the manager 1616 attempt to send the information item externally via firewall 1620 to the internet 1622 or via fax 1624, the external distribution inspection and control module 1618<br><br>
verifies the integrity of the information item and according to the policy dictated by the policy reference monitor 1608 determines whether to allow o/to block the information transaction.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the system<br>
interfaces with the organizational document management system. Document<br>
management systems are useful tools for managing confidential information,<br>
however, these systems manage files that are generally in a proprietary file<br>
format and enforce a policy only with respect to such pre-defined file formats.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the system obtains the<br>
definition of the policy from the document management system and<br>
supplements the document management system by enforcing policy with '<br>
respect to information objects rather then files. In this case, the system extracts ■<br>
identifiers from the documents in the files and identifies and transfers<br>
corresponding policies from the document management system. The system<br>
then enforces the distribution policy defined by the document management<br>
system with respect to information object, regardless of their format.	In<br>
another aspect of the present invention, the system scans for pre-designated information objects in storage devices, such as the user's hard disks, in order to locate unauthorized content stored by a user, utilizing client-side software. Preferably tamper resistant client-side software is used for that purpose.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the system utilizes client-side software in order to enforce a policy on the users. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the client is a tamper-resistant client, which uses a secure connection to a centralized database in which descriptors of information-objects, together with the corresponding policies, are stored. Methods for constructing such a tamper-resistant client are described, e.g., in US patent application 10/051,012, "A Method and a System for Securing Digital Video", filed January 22, 2002, and in US provisional patent application 60/437,031, "A method and system for protecting confidential information", filed December 31, 2002, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The client preferably monitors policy-regulated activities such as editing, storing, particularly storing on potentially mobile devices, sending, copying segments or printing. The client reports its findings and may prevent<br><br>
actions not allowed by the policy. The client may also monitor and report attempts to circumvent the system's protection.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the correspondence between information objects and policies and/or rules is induced by defining the policy and/or the rule as a property of information object.<br>
During the process of knowledge acquisition, some elementary information units are accumulated and clustered, while other elementary information units are subtracted. In order to be able to trace the information, a tracking channel is assigned to any information object. The tracking channel utilizes the notions of similarity (described above) and continuity in order to trace information evolution along the information lifecycle. The tracking channel can utilize any of many known methods, for example those taught in D. Hall, "Lectures in Multisensor Data Fusion and Target Tracking", Artech House; ISBN: 1580531407; Cd-Rom edition (March 2001), the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the default policy and other aspects of tracking, usage monitoring and policy enforcement are created and implemented taking into account at least one of the following criteria:<br>
•	Information properties of the information object, for example<br>
language, representation, etc.<br>
•	The operations carried out on the information object<br>
•	The various users along the information life cycle.<br>
•	The software applications used with respect to the information object.<br>
•	The transmission channel.<br>
•	The participant agents.<br><br>
•	The virtual, logical and physical location of the computers.<br>
•	Computer types (lap-top, desk-top, server, etc)<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the system allows defining and enforcing of a policy that prevents sending or copying of specific information objects to a laptop computer and/or portable media.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the system allows<br><br>
defining and enforcing of a policy that prevents sending or copying of specific information objects from a computerized device that is not located within the perimeter that is subject to monitoring and inspection. In a'preferred embodiment of the present invention, this is done via a software client that resides on the computer and monitors information usage, as explained, e.g., in US provisional patent application 60/437,031 the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the system allows defining of a policy that prevents sending or copying of specific information objects unless they are encrypted to the system's satisfaction.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the system automatically encrypts specific information objects using a default key, as part of a default policy, and sends the encrypted content to the recipients. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the system disseminates specific information objects, as part of a default policy, using a secure channel such as TLS (Transport Level Security).<br>
In another aspect of the present embodiments, the system creates information about the relationships between different information collections rather than infonnation about the information collected within the information collections, thus revealing information not contained in any of these collections. The relationship information may include history and workflow information, template related information and other information, and is sometimes referred to as meta information.<br>
This creation of information can be facilitated by comparing different documents, locating similarities and differences, this, especially combined with external information (such as file creation, modification and access date, relevant users, meta data contained in the files or in a file management system etc.), can be used to discern the workflow related to these documents, their relationship to each other (e.g. document B is based on documents A and C) and be used for reporting or other purposes. This kind of information is useful for document management, especially when combined with a document management system, for archival purposes, and for reference purposes. When document access and use is regulated by a policy, this information is useful for policy enforcement and definition.<br><br>
In another aspect of the present invention a method and system for knowledge management and control are presented, based on modular and abstract descriptions of knowledge. In this case, the elementary units are denoted as facts. As a first step in practicing the invention, elementary facts (EF) are defined. These elementary facts may be represented as sentences (e.g., "Mr. John Doe earn 65000$ in 2001"), as entries to a database etc. The system then assigns representation-independent identifiers and indices for each elementary fact. Knowledge objects, consist of one or more facts are thereafter defined by the system. For example, a set of facts about Mr. John Doe can be considered as a knowledge object. Within the context of this aspect of the present invention, a knowledge object is the basic ingredient on which a knowledge-oriented policy is defined. A simple knowledge object is a knowledge object that can be fully described as a set of elementary facts, while a compound knowledge object is a knowledge object that consists of two or more simple knowledge objects. A knowledge class is the set of all knowledge objects on which precisely the same policy is defined. An instance of a knowledge object is a specific representation of the knowledge object, e.g., a file of a database in a MS-Access™ format. Utilizing this terminology and nomenclature, a system substantially similar to the one described above can be used in order to provide confidential knowledge management.<br>
The information assets within an organization (e.g., financial information used for balance sheets) tend to evolve along a path, and undergo various stages of processing, validation, reviewing and assurance until the final product is produced. Maintaining the Confidentiality, Integrity &amp; Availability (CIA) of the information along the process poses a non-trivial problem for most organizations.<br>
In order to solve these problems, the organizations may consistently attempt to maintain an Intact Information Path, based on the following methodological steps:<br>
• Risk assessment: at a given stage, various potentially dangerous scenarios should be considered and their impact should be analyzed. The impact analysis should take into consideration both aspects of legislation and liability and direct and indirect damage to the oraanization from breach of the confidentiality.<br><br>
integrity and availability of the infonnation. • Defining a well-formed information path for various types of information. Such a path requires all of the organizational information to be classified, and that for any type or class of information, information regarding ownership and path are carefully planned, defined and tested according to specific needs. The definition of the infonnation path may include:<br>
■	Ownership: Selection and appointment of information owners and ownership hierarchy according to the owners' role in the organization.<br>
■	Storage and Availability: Definition of authorized storage devices and methods and their security policy and availability level.<br>
■	Access Policy &amp; Control: definition of the access privileges of the various entities and the required identification, authentication and authorizations. This well known practice should be carefully employed in order to assure compliance with organizational needs and to verify that the access policy is enforced with respect to the information assets, regardless of their representations,<br>
. instantiations and formats.<br>
■	Usage and Processing: various entities that participate in the infonnation path should be entitled, or required, to perform certain tasks, such as information possessing and filtering, integrity validation and assurance, final approval etc.<br>
■	Distribution Policy: the distribution policy includes statements and rules regarding the authorized communication channels, authorized senders and recipients, the authorized formats, the required recipients, and any other restrictions and constrains with respect to any information item.<br>
■	Audit and Detection: There is preferably provided an audit   program   that   covers   all   of   the   aspects   of<br><br>
information access, usage, manipulation and transition. The system preferably detect and records all the relevant parameters in order to provide a comprehensive audit and allows the reconstruction of the chain of events when needed. Detection rules for irregularities may be designed together with actions to take on events. ■    Retention Policy: In order to limit the risk of information leakage while maintaining important information assets, a proper information retention policy may be defined. The retention policy may specify the minimal and/or the maximal time for which the information should be kept, the level of confidentiality that should be maintained during the various stages of the information lifecycle and possibly also the timeline for information disclosure. It is important that the retention policy is defined with respect to the information asset regardless of its instantiation: in many cases, after a specific file or document was deleted, other instances of the information item exists — e.g., under  a different  filename  and/or in  a different  file format,   thereby   exposing   the   organization   to   unnecessary   legal   liabilities   and   perils   of unwelcome information disclosure. •    Maintaining the Intact Information Path: in order to   prevent fraud the information flow within an organization should be continuously monitored and inspected, so that no covert channels are   available   and  that  the   integrity   and   the   accuracy   of disseminated   or   disclosed   information   can   be   confirmed. Therefore, after the information path is defined, it should be constantly inspected and monitored in order to assure that:<br>
1.	No unauthorized party is added to the path.<br>
2.	No entity that should be in the path is bypassed<br>
3.	The integrity of information is preserved along the path: information items are changed, manipulated, added or deleted only by authorized entities and in an authorized<br><br>
manner.<br>
In order to achieve the above goals, the information path may contain inspection &amp; control points, in which the distribution policy is enforced and the integrity of the information is verified.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the policy further includes a mandatory lifecycle. A mandatory lifecycle is a process that must be undergone in certain circumstances, e.g. when a certain user sends a certain type of information to a certain recipient, another predefined recipient (usually a supervisor or auditor) must also be a recipient (usually in order to prevent fraud, and to facilitate auditing).
