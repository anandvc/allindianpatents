BACKGROUND<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an automatic bar bundle bending device which is capable of automatically bending bars which are rolled out of a re-rolling mill, said device providing uniform bending to said bars.<br>
DISCUSSION OF PRIOR ART<br>
Reinforced concrete is perhaps the most common material of construction today. Its demand as well as new applications are ever increasing. Use of mild steel Fe 250 as reinforcement heralded the beginning of RCC construction. The high cost of Steel lead to the introduction of high strength Steel i.e. CTD / TOR Steel Bars, which were manufactured in low speed mills and in which each bar had to be individually cold twisted manually. In the recent years, technology has advanced such that as the hot rolled ribbed bar emerges from the finishing stand of the bar mill, it is rapidly cooled. This quenching process converts the surface layer of the bar to a hardened structure giving excellent yield strength to the bars, which are manufactured in high speed mills totally automatically. With the increase in production and consequently the surface of the bars being hardened, it is difficult for the bundle of bars to be bent manually. Therefore, there is a need for developing a device / machine for bending of bundle automatically.<br>
US Patent 5558012 provides an automatic bundling machine. Here first the pair of hooks open to receive the bundling object and then close. Then the band-feeding rotary actuator rotates in the reverse, pulling the band in the opposite direction to the feeding making the band bundle the bundling object of different diameter.<br>
US Patent 5906126 provides an angle-adjusting device of steel bar bending apparatus where a required number of adjusting units are combined. Further, when the motor is actuated to bend a steel bar, the shafts are rotated to make the projections approach the switches. When the first projection triggers the switch, it means first bend is formed on the steel bar and the motor stops. Then the user manually moves the steel bar to the region where a second bend is required and restarts the motor. When the second projection triggers the respective switch the motor stops and<br><br>
the second bend is formed on the steel bar. This is repeated until the required numbers of bends are formed.<br>
US Patent 7140225 describes a method of bending pipe and apparatus therefore. Here the pipe subjected to bending is placed in position by fitting it longitudinally into the recessed grooves of the restriction pads and horizontally with the movable die. Then the movable die base is moved downward to apply the required pressing force set by the bending punch to bend the pipe. Once the pipe is bent, the movable die base is moved upward to bring it back to a standby state.<br>
US Patent 4252157 relates to an automatic bundling apparatus. Here first, the opening-closing guide should be opened then the bundling object is placed in a suitable position near the fixed guide. Further, the swinging motor is operated to close the opening-closing guide, the feed motor is started, and the wire is fed from the guide to wrap the bundling object.<br>
The novel aspect of the Device / Machine is that it helps to automate the bending and packing of long bars rolled out of Steel Rolling Mills as well as in handling yard of Steel Distributors were bulk handling is done which is not possible manually. Salient features of the bar bundle bending device includes the ability to support bundle sizes which weigh in a wide range between 40 to 300 kgs. The production capacity supported by the use of this device is in the order of 5 to 40 mt / hour. Smooth and uniform bending is supported by means of this device, which can handle several radii of bars which are rolled out.<br>
In any industry, the quantity and quality of the finished product plays a major role in market competitiveness. Quick and efficient handling facilities accent both the quality and turnover of the re-rolling mills. As per prior art, the Steel industry has met several milestones in the packing process for all types of products which are processed in a re-rolling mill setup. For example, TMT (6 to 40 mm) in straight lengths, can be processed by the device of the present invention. The bars go through a pipeline of various mechanical operations, starting from a holding area for handling the bars. The material or bars or sections are then pulled manually and bent at the stacking or loading point. Manual operations are cumbersome and inefficient because the bending quality is not uniform and differs from section to section.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an automatic bar bundle bending device, which will receive the material from the re-rolling mill. In the present invention, the<br><br>
material is immediately bent by means of a mechanical device, the bar handling cum bundling device and then transferred by means of a conveyor to the stacking or oading area. By this process there is uniform bend without damaging the quality of products along with faster handling and ready dispatching of the products immediately after rolling.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a bar bundle bending device comprised of several functional components including sprocket blocks, chain sprockets, hammering blocks, hammering pins, idle pins, idle rolls, shafts for the chain sprocket, reduction gear boxes, bearings and link chains. The sprocket block holds the chain sprocket and the sprocket shaft. The sprocket block, chain sprocket and the sprocket shaft combine to provide the driving force for the chain. The hammering pin, idle pin and idle rolls are assembled in a hammering block and alongside the arms of the device. This component holds the hammer with the set of idle rollers, which ultimately hammers the bundle to get the required bending radius. The link chain holds the block for bringing the bundle to the hammering position and throwing it out of the machine after bending. The device is powered by means of an electrical motor, which provides power to the various mechanical units, acting in conjunction to perform the functions of the device. The weight of the bundles supported by this device is upto 300 kgs and the speed of the device is controllable by using a control panel. Bars upto 40mm in dimension can be bent by the use of this device.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A bar bending machine constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention is shown in Fig 1. The machine basically includes a bar handling and bundling area 116; a conveyor belt with such functional components as a sprocket block, shaft for chain sprocket, chain sprocket, link chain 114; a bending zone 113 which includes a hammering block, hammering pin, idle rolls, idle pins; idle rolls 117 and finally an outlet for the withdrawal of bent bars from the machine 112.<br>
The bars to be bent are first fed into the bar handling and bundling area 116. The height and width of the bars depend on the individual requirements. These bars are then conveyed to the conveyor belt 114. This belt is powered by a sprocket block 1, shown in Fig. 2. This sprocket block 1 holds the shaft for chain sprocket 76, shown in Fig. 8. This shaft for chain sprocket 77 provides the driving force to the chain sprocket 18, shown in Fig. 3. The sprocket chain 18, depicted in Fig. 3, comprises of six projections 17 equidistant from each other and from the center 16 as shown in Fig 3. The rotational force generated by the sprocket block 1 is converted into a linear force for the link chain (97,99,101), shown in Fig. 9. The link chain pulls the bars to be bend towards the bending zone 113 as well as carries the bent bars out of the machine. Fig. 9a is a side view of the link chain while Fig. 9b is a top view 102 of the link chain respectively.<br>
The arms of the bundle bending device, shown in Fig. 1, are provided with idle rolls 117 that are held in position by idle pins to give the desired radius. Fig 6a is the top view of the idle roll showing a circular component 55 with three-measured radii and Fig 6b is the side view 57 of the idle roll. Fig 7a is the top view of the idle pin showing a circular component 64 with three-measured radii and fig 7b is the side view 59 of the idle pin.<br>
The bars are then moved to the narrow channel called the bending zone 113. This embodiment comprises of a hammering block, hammering pin, idle rolls, idle pins as described in Fig. 4, 5, 6a, 6b, 7a, 7b respectively. The hammering block, shown in Fig. 4 comprises of a hammer with a handle 32, an arm 37 and a head 36. The head 36 is the main functional component that effectuates bar bending in either clockwise or in a counter clockwise direction. The hammering pin 47, shown in Fig. 5, holds the idle rolls in position restricting the bending to the desired radius. The bars after being bent in the bending zone 113 are then passed to the outlet 112 where they can be withdrawn from the machine.<br><br><br><br><br>
