				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a filtering device for the removal of arsenic from ground surface drinking water.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Arsenic poisoning of ground/surface water presently adversely affects the hugs population of several countries including India, Bangladesh, Argentina, Mexico, Chile, Mongolia, Vietnam etc. Arsenic poisoning of ground/surface water is a serious health hazard and it affects approximately 90 million people at global level. The magnitude of the problem of Arsenic poisoning has reached such proportion in India, Bangladesh and Vietnam that it needs immediate attention. There is a need for a suitable filtering device for removal of Arsenic from the ground/surface water which can be used at household level and which is within the economic reach of ordinary households. The device must be simpler, cheaper and easy to use requiring cheaper and easily available raw materials.<br>
A number of techniques/devices, for the removal of Arsenic from drinking water, have been reported and are known to the prior art. These techniques/devices basically work on the principles of co-precipitation, coagulation, adsorption, use of ion exchange resin and reverse osmosis membranes and are mainly for community type treatment systems.<br>
One of the process for the removal of Arsenic from drinking water, known<br>
in the prior art, is by using activated alumina. However, this process suffers<br>
from many disadvantages.	<br>
The primary disadvantages of this process, known in the art, is that it does not remove Arsenic to the desired level as prescribed for drinking water and has better removal for Arsenic (V) as compared to Arsenic (III), the latter being four times more toxic. Furthermore, it cannot be reused without alkali washing.<br>
Another process for the removal of Arsenic from drinking water, known in the prior art, is by using chemically treated alumna. However, this process also suffers from many disadvantages.<br>
Primary disadvantage of this process, known in the art, is that it does not remove Arsenic to the desired drinking water limit. Further, this process leaches other harmful chemicals in the water and is an expensive process.<br>
Yet another Arsenic removing filter, known in the prior art, uses ceramic filters. However, this filter is expensive and is not very effective for complete removal of Arsenic and more particularly for the removal of Arsenic (III).<br><br>
Still another type of Arsenic removing filter, known in the prior art, uses iron and manganese oxide coated sand. However, this filter also suffers from the disadvantage that it leaches iron and manganese in drinking water, which is undesirable.<br>
Another type of Arsenic removing technique, known in prior art, is based on ultra violet oxidation of Arsenic followed by sedimentation and filtration. The main disadvantage of this technique is that it removes only eighty percent of Arsenic from the contaminated water, which is not sufficient.<br>
' Another Arsenic removal technique at the household level, known to the prior art, includes use of iron tablets for.co-precipitation of Arsenic followed by filtration through, candles made-up of clay and carbon powder. However, this technique also suffers from the problems faced in cleaning of candles and disposing off the sludge. Further, the technique is also not cost effective.<br>
US patent No. 6,132,623 discloses the use of mixture of iron scrap and quartz sand in a reactor for in-situ treatment of Arsenic contaminated ground water. However, this technique also suffers from the disadvantage that it is not suitable for removal of Arsenic from water at household level.<br>

The raw materials used i.e. steel wool and treated sand are easily and cheaply available thereby making the device quite affordable and within the economic reach of ordinary households. Further the device is simpler to use thus suitable for households.<br>
Any further characteristics, advantages and applications of the invention will become evident from the detailed description of the preferred embodiment which has been described and illustrated with the help of following drawings: -<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS;<br>
Fig. 1 shows a view of the filtering device of the present invention.<br><br>
Referring to Figure 1, The filtering device of the present invention comprises three chambers (8), (9) &amp; (10). The first chamber (10) contains steel wool (2) soaked in water. The steel wool (2) is prepared from waste generated by steel plant. Steel wool, received as waste material from the steel plant is thoroughly washed with water to remove any contaminants already present before use in the filtering device. The second chamber (9) contains treated river sand (4). The river sand (4) is washed, air-dried and treated with KMn04.before putting it in the second chamber (9). A fine cloth filter (3) is placed on top of the sand to filter the precipitate particles and avoid contamination in sand. Similarly, a fine cloth filter (5) is placed at the bottom of this chamber.Quantity .of steel wool (2) and treated sand (4) is about 400 grams and 1200 grams respectively The quantity of steel wool (2) and sand (4) can be optimised for &gt; 99% removal of all types of Arsenic compounds in water under continuous flow conditions. In the first chamber (10), iron arsenate and iron arsenite are co-precipated by the reaction of steel wool (2) with Arsenic in water. The treated river sand (4), present in the second chamber (9), simultaneously removes iron leached out during the above reaction. The outer body including three chambers (10), (9) and (8) of the filtering device can be made from meta or non-metals including stainless steel and plastic.<br>
The contaminated water is placed in the top chamber (10) through the water inlet (1). The water is allowed to flow at an optimised constant flow at the level between 15 liters/hour and 30 liters/hour. The pH value of the mixture is between 6-10.The contaminated water passes from the first chamber (10) to the second chamber (9) through steel wool (2) and fine cotton cloth (3). This partially filtered water again passes to the third chamber (7) through treated river sand (4) and fine cloth filter (5). The third chamber (8) contains the pure water (6), free from Arsenic and other undesirable contaminants specially Iron, Coliforms and E.coli., which can be taken out through an outlet (7) placed at the bottom of third chamber (8).<br>
The filter device operates at the ambient room temperature. Total volume of water filtered depends upon the initial concentration of Arsenic in water. The life of the filtering material i.e. steel wool depends upon the initial concentration of the contaminants (Arsenic (III) and Arsenic (V) ) as well as upon the total volume of the water filtered through the filtering device. Typically, in a household using 20-25 liters of water per day, the steel wool shall need replacement after one month. However, the expenditure involve will be about Rs 25/ only making the device extremely cheaper and well within the economic reach of the average household even in Asian countries.<br>
The metal ion concentration estimation of steel wool and sand samples was carried out using Phillips X-ray Fluorescence (XRF), and surface area was measured using Micromeritics ASAP 2010 Surface Analyzer. Main characteristics of the materials used therein are given below:<br>
