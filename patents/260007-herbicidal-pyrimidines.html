FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to certain pyrimidines, their JV-oxides, agriculturally suitable<br>
salts and compositions, and methods of their use for controlling undesirable vegetation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The control of undesired vegetation is extremely important in achieving high crop<br>
efficiency. Achievement of selective control of the growth of weeds especially in such<br>
useful crops as rice, soybean, sugar beet, corn (maize), potato, wheat, barley, tomato and<br>
plantation crops, among others, is very desirable. Unchecked weed growth in such useful<br>
crops can cause significant reduction in productivity and thereby result in increased costs to<br>
the consumer. The control of undesired vegetation in noncrop areas is also important. Many<br>
products are commercially available for these purposes, but the need continues for new<br>
compounds which are more effective, less costly, Jess toxic, environmentally safer of'have<br>
different modes of action.<br>
World Patent Application Publication WO 92/05159-A discloses pyrimidines useful as<br>
plant protectants, especially fungicides. European Patent Application Publication<br>
EP-136976-A2 discloses pyrimidines as plant growth regulators. U.S. Patent 5,324,710<br>
discloses sulfonated heterocyclic carboxamide derivatives of pyrimidines as herbicides and<br>
growth regulators.<br>

DETAILS OF THE INVENTION<br>
As used herein, the terms "comprises," "comprising," "includes," "including," "has,"<br>
"having" or any other variation thereof, are intended to cover a non-exclusive inclusion. For<br>
example, a composition, process, method, article, or apparatus that comprises a list of<br>
elements is not necessarily .limited to only those elements but may include other elements<br>
not expressly listed or inherent to such composition, process, method, article, or apparatus.<br>
Further, unless expressly stated to the contrary, "or" refers to an inclusive or and not to an<br>
exclusive or. For example, a condition A or B is satisfied by any one of the following: A is<br>
true (or present) and B is false (or not present), A is false (or not present) and B is true (or<br>
present), and both A and B are true (or present).<br>
Also, the indefinite articles "a" and "an" preceding an element or component of the<br>
invention are intended to be rtontestrictive regarding the number of instances (i.e.<br>
occurrences) of the element or component Therefore "a" or "an" should be read to include<br>
one or at least one, and the singular word form of the element or component also includes<br>
the plural unless the number is obviously meant to be singular.<br>
In the above recitations, the term "alkyl", used either alone or in compound words such<br>
as "alkylthio" or "haloalkyl" includes straight-chain or branched alkyl, such as, methyl,<br>
•ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, or the different butyl, pentyl or hexyl isomers. "Alkenyl" includes<br>
-straight-chain or branched alkenes such as ethenyl, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl, and the different<br>
•butenyl, pentenyl and hexenyl isomers. "Alkenyl" also includes polyenes such as<br>
1,2-propadienyl and 2,4-hexadienyl. "Alkynyl" includes straight-chain or branched alkynes<br>
such as ethynyl, 1-propynyl, 2-propynyl and the different butynyl, pentynyl and hexynyl<br>
isomers. "Alkynyl" can also include moieties comprised of multiple triple bonds such as<br>
2,5-hexadiynyl. "Alkoxy" includes, for example, methoxy, ethoxy, n-propyloxy,<br>
isopropyloxy and the different butbxy, pentoxy and hexyloxy isomers.'•'."Alkoxyalkyl"<br>
denotes, alkoxy substitution on alkyl. Examples of "alkoxyalkyl" "include CH3OCH2; •<br>
:CH3OCH2CH2.. CH3CH2OCH2 and CH3CH2OCH2CH2; : "Alkenyloxy" .includes*<br>
straight-chain or branched alkenyloxy moieties. Examples of "alkenyloxy" include<br>
H2C=CHCH2O, (CH3)CH=CHCH20 and CH2=CHCH2CH20. "Alkynyloxy" includes<br>
straight-chain or branched alkynyloxy moieties. Examples of "alkynyloxy" include<br>
HOCH20 and CH3OCCH20. "Alkylthio" includes branched or straight-chain alkylthio<br>
moieties such as methylthio, ethylthio, and the different propylthio and butylthio isomers.<br>
"Alkylsulfinyl" includes both enantiomers of an alkylsulfinyl group. Examples of<br>
"alkylsuffinyl" include CH3S(0), CH3CH2S(0), CH3CH2CH2S(0), (CH3)2CHS(O) and the<br>
different butylsulfinyl isomers. Examples of "alkylsulfonyl" include CH3S(O)2,<br>
CH3CH2S(0)2, CH3CH2CH2S(O)2, (CH3)2CHS(0)2 and the different butylsulfonyl<br>
isomers. "Alkylamino", "dialkylamino", "alkenylthio", "alkenylsulfinyl",<br>
"alkenylsulfonyl", "alkynylthio", "alkynylsulfinyl", "alkynylsulfonyl", and the like, are<br>
defined analogously to the above examples. "Cycloalkyl" includes, for example,<br>
cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl. Examples of "cycloalkylalkyl"<br>
include cyclopropylmethyl, cyclopentylethyl, and other cycloalkyl moieties bonded to<br>
straight-chain or branched alkyl groups. "Alkylcycloalkyl" denotes alkyl substitution on a<br>
cycloalkyl moiety. Examples include 4-methylcyclohexyl and 3-ethylcyclopentyl. The term<br>
"heteroarornatic ring" includes fully aromatic heterocycles. Aromatic indicates that each of<br>
the ring atoms is essentially in the same plane and has a p-orbital perpendicular to the ring<br>
plane, and in which (4n + 2) n electrons, when n is 0 or a positive integer, are associated<br>
with the ring to comply with Huckel's rule. The term carbocyclic aromatic radical is<br>
synonymous with the term isocyclic aromatic radical. A wide variety of synthetic methods<br>
are known in the art to enable preparation of aromatic heterocyclic rings; for extensive<br>
reviews see the eight volume set of Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry, A. R. Katritzky<br>
and C. W. Rees editors-in-chief, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1984 and the twelve volume set of<br>
Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry II, A. R. Katritzky, C. W. Rees and E. F. V. Scriven<br>
editors-in-chief, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1996. The 5- and 6-membered heteroaromatic<br>
rings described for R7 typically comprise 1 to 4 heteroatom ring members, the heteroatom<br>
members selected from 0-4 N, 0-1 O and 0-1 S atoms. Exhibit 1 shows examples of<br>
heteroaromatic rings; H-l through H-55 are to be construed as illustrative rather than<br>
limiting of the heteroaromatic rings within the scope of the present invention.<br>

wherein<br>
each R71 is independently R45;<br>
R71a R72 and R73 are independently H or R45;<br>
p is an integer from 0 to 3; and<br>
q is an integer from 0 to 2.<br>
References herein to R7 groups H-l through H-55 refer to those shown in Exhibit 1.<br>
One skilled in the art will appreciate that not all nitrogen-containing heterocycles can<br>
form N-oxides since the nitrogen requires an available lone pair of electrons for oxidation to<br>
the oxide; one skilled in the art will recognize those nitrogen containing heterocycles which<br>
can form N-oxides. One skilled in the art will also recognize that tertiary amines can form<br>
W-oxides. Synthetic methods for the preparation of W-oxides of heterocycles and tertiary<br>
amines are very well known by one skilled in the art including the oxidation of heterocycles<br>
and tertiary amines with peroxy acids such as peracetic and m-chloroperbenzoic acid<br>
(MCPBA), hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydroperqxides such as t-butyl hydroperoxide, sodium<br>
perborate, and dioxiranes such as dimethydioxirane. These methods for the preparation of<br>
N-oxides have been extensively described and reviewed in the literature, see for example:<br>

The term "halogen", either alone or hi compound words such as "haloalkyl", includes<br>
fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. Further, when used in compound words such as<br>
"haloalkyl", said alkyl may be partially or fully substituted with halogen atoms which may<br>
be the same or different Examples of "haloalkyl" include F3C, C1CH2, CF3CH2 and<br>
CF3CC12. The terms "haloalkenyl", "haloalkynyl", "haloalkoxy", "haloalkylthio", and the<br>
like, are defined analogously to the term "haloalkyl". Examples of "haloalkenyl" include<br>
(C1)2C=CHCH2 and CF3CH2CH=CHCH2. Examples of "haloalkynyl" include HOCCHC1,<br>
C F 3 C = C , CC13C=C and FCH2C=CCH2. Examples of "haloalkoxy" include CF3O,<br>
CC13CH2O, HCF2CH2CH20 and CF3CH20. Examples of "haloalkylthio" include CC13S,<br>
CF3S, CCI3CH2S and C1CH2CH2CH2S. Examples of "haloalkylsulfinyl" include CF3S(O),<br>
CC13S(O), CF3CH2S(O) and CF3CF2S(0). Examples of "haloalkylsulfonyl" include<br>
CF3S(O)2, CC13S(0)2, CF3CH2S(0)2 and CF3CF2S(0)2.<br>
The total number of carbon atoms in a substituent group is indicated by the "Cj-Cj"<br>
prefix where i and j are numbers from 1 to 14. For example, C1-C3 alkylsulfonyl designates<br>
methylsulfonyl through propylsulfonyl; C2 alkoxyalkyl designates CH3OCH2; C3<br>
alkoxyalkyl designates, for example, CH3CH(OCH3), CH3OCH2CH2 or CH3CH2OCH2;<br>
and C4 alkoxyalkyl designates the various isomers of an alkyl group substituted with an<br>
alkoxy group containing a total of four carbon atoms, examples including<br>
CH3CH2CH2OCH2 and CH3CH2OCH2CH2. Examples of "alkylcarbonyl" include<br>
C(0)CH3, C(O)CH2CH2CH3 and C(O)CH(CH3)2. Examples of "alkoxycarbonyl" include<br>
CH3OC(=O), CH3CH2OC(=0), CH3CH2CH2OC(=0), (CH3)2CHOC(=O) and the different<br>
butoxy- or pentoxycarbonyl isomers. In the above recitations, when a compound of<br>
Formula I is comprised of one or more heterocyclic rings, all substituents are attached to<br>
these rings through any available carbon or nitrogen by replacement of a hydrogen on said<br>
carbon or nitrogen.<br>
When a compound is substituted with a substituent bearing a subscript (e.g., (Rd)1_3)<br>
that indicates the number of instances (i.e. occurrences) of said substituent can vary or the<br>
substituent is preceded with a numeric range (e.g., 1-3 Rd) indicating the number of<br>
instances of said subsituent can vary, then when the number of said instances is greater than<br>
10<br>
1, each instance is independently selected from the group of radicals defined for the<br>
substituent Further, when the subscript indicates a range, e.g., (Rd)i_j, then the number of<br>
substituent instances may be selected from the integers between i and j inclusive.<br>
"-CHtC(0)0(CH2)mrmeans \n ; "-CHfCXCHoU"means <br>
When a group contains a substituent which can be hydrogen, for example R15 or R34,<br>
then, when this substituent is taken as hydrogen, it is recognized that this is equivalent to<br>
said group being unsubstituted.<br>
Compounds of this invention can exist as one or more stereoisomers. The various<br>
stereoisomers include enantiomers, diastereomers, atropisomers and geometric isomers. One<br>
skilled in the art will appreciate that one stereoisomer may be more active and/or may<br>
exhibit beneficial effects when enriched relative to the other stereoisomer(s) or when<br>
•separated from the other stereoisomer(s). Additionally, the skilled artisan knows how to<br>
separate, enrich, and/or to selectively prepare said stereoisomers. Accordingly, the present<br>
invention comprises compounds selected from Formula I, N-oxides and agriculturally<br>
suitable salts thereof. The compounds of the invention may be present as a mixture of<br>
stereoisomers, individual stereoisomers, or as an optically active form.<br>
The compounds of Formula I wherein R is CC2H (i.e. a carboxylic acid function) are<br>
believed to be the compounds that bind to an active site on a plant enzyme or receptor<br>
causing herbicidal effect on the plant. Othet compounds of Formula I wherein the<br>
substituent R is a group that can be transformed within.plants or the environment to a<br>
carboxylic acid function (i.e. CO2H) provide similar herbicidal effects and are within the<br>
scope of the present invention. Therefore "a herbicidally effective derivative of CO2H"<br>
when used to describe the substituent R in Formula I is defined as any salt, ester,<br>
carboxamide, acyl hydrazide, imidate, thioimidate, amidine, acyl halide, acyl cyanide, acid<br>
anhydride, ether, acetal, orthoester, carboxaldehyde, oxime, hydrazone, thioacid, thioester,<br>
dithiolester, nitrile or any other carboxylic acid derivative known in the art which does not<br>
extinguish the herbicidal activity of the compound of Formula I and is or can be hydrolyzed,<br>
oxidized, reduced or otherwise metabolized in plants or soil to provide the carboxylic acid<br>
function, which depending upon pH, is in the dissociated or the undissociated form.<br>
Agriculturally suitable salts of the compounds of the invention are salts formed by<br>
contact with acids or bases or through ion exchange such that the derived salts retain<br>
•sufficient water solubility for bioavailability and thus herbicidal efficacy and that the<br>
counterfoils of the salts are suitable for use in agriculture. The agriculturally suitable salts of<br>
the compounds of the invention include acid-addition salts with inorganic or organic acids<br>
such as hydrobromic, hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric, acetic, butyric, fumaric,<br>
lactic, maleic, malonic, oxalic, propionic, salicylic, tartaric, 4-toluenesulfonic or valeric<br>
• acids. The agriculturally suitable salts of the compounds of the invention also include those<br>
formed with strong bases (e.g., hydroxides of sodium, potassium, lithium or quaternary<br>
ammonium) or amines. One skilled in the art recognizes that because in the environment<br>
and under physiological conditions salts of the compounds of the invention are in<br>
5 equilibrium with their corresponding nonsalt forms, agriculturally suitable salts share the<br>
biological utility of the nonsalt forms.<br>
Particularly useful are agriculturally suitable salts of compounds of Formula I wherein<br>
R is C02H (including wherein R2 is C02H) formed with strong bases or amines. As is well<br>
known in the art, contact of a carboxylic acid group (C02H) with a base causes<br>
10 deprotonation to give the corresponding carboxylate ion (CO2<br>
e) and a typically positively<br>
charged counterion derived from the base. An extensive range of counterions form<br>
agriculturally suitable salts of compounds of Formula I wherein R is CO2H, as most of the<br>
derived salts have sufficient water solubility for bioavailability. Illustrative and of particular<br>
note are salts of compounds of Formula I in which R is CO2H wherein the counterion ion is<br>
15 an alkali metal cation such as lithium, sodium or potassium, quarternary ammonium such as<br>
tetramethylammonium, ternary sulfonium such as trimethylsulfonium, or derived from an<br>
amine such as dimethylamine, diethanolamine (diolamine), triethanolamine (trolamine).<br>
Also particularly useful are ester and thioester derivatives of CO2H as R in the<br>
compounds of Formula I. As is well known in the art, ester groups (i.e. C02RAL) result<br>
20 from condensation of a carboxylic acid function (C02H) with an alcohol (i.e. RALOH)<br>
wherein RAL is the radical derived from the alcohol; a wide range of methods are known to<br>
prepare such esters. Analogously, thioester groups of formula C(0)SRAL may be<br>
conceptually viewed as the condensation product of a carboxylic acid function with a<br>
thioalcohol (often called a mercaptan) of formula RALSH; a variety of methods are known to<br>
25 prepare such tbioesters. As compounds of Formula I wherein R is C02H are herbicidally<br>
active and their derived esters and thioesters are susceptible to hydrolysis (to R being CO2H)<br>
particularly in the presence of hydrolytic enzymes, the compounds of Formula I wherein R1<br>
is an ester (i.e. CO2RAL) or thioester (i.e. C(0)SRAL) are generally useful as herbicides. Of<br>
the herbicidally effective derivatives of C02H, the ester and thioester derivatives,<br>
30 particularly ester derivatives, are among the most conveniently prepared and useful. If the<br>
radical R^ has more than one OH or SH function, the radical may then be condensed with<br>
more than one pyrimidine ring system of Formula I having C02H as R. As the derived<br>
multiply esterified derivatives can be hydrolyzed to the compound of Formula I having<br>
C02H as R, said multiply esterified derivatives are among the herbicidally effective<br>
35 derivatives of CO2H. Illustrative and of note are ester and thioester compounds of Formula I<br>
in which R being CO2H is esterified with methanol, ethanol, butanol, 2-butoxyethanol,<br>
2-ethylhexanol, isopropanol, 2-methyJpropanol (isobutanol), octanol isomers (isoctanol) and<br>
ethanethiol to form methyl, ethyl, butyl, 2-butoxyethyl, 2-ethylhexyl, isopropyl,<br>
2-methypropyl, isoctyl and ethylthio esters, respectively. Of particular note are the methyl<br>
and ethyl esters.<br>

surfactant.<br>
At the same time, plants selected from these crop and weed species were treated with<br>
postemergence applications of some of the test chemicals formulated in the same manner.<br>
Plants ranged in height from 2 to 18 cm (1- to 4-leaf stage) for postemergence treatments.<br>
Treated plants and controls were maintained in a controlled growth environment for 15 to 25<br>
days after which time all species were compared to controls and visually evaluated. Plant<br>

TESTE<br>
Three plastic pots (ca. 16-cm diameter) per rate were partially filled with sterilized<br>
Tama silt loam soil comprising a 35:50:15 ratio of sand, silt and clay and 2.6% organic .<br>
matter. Separate plantings for each of the three pots were as follows. Seeds from the U.S. of<br>
ducksalad (Heteranthera limosa), smallflower umbrella sedge (Cyperus diffonnis) and<br>
purple redstem (Amnannia coccinea), were planted into one 16-cm pot for each rate. Seeds<br>
from the U.S. of rice flatsedge (Cyperus iria\ bearded (brdd.) sprangletop (Leptochloa fusca<br>
ssf.fascicularis), one stand of 9 or 10 water seeded rice seedlings (Oryza sativa cv.<br>
'Japonica - M202'), and one stand of 6 transplanted rice seedlings (Oryza sativa cv.<br>
'Japonica - M202') were planted into one 16-cm pot for each rate. Seeds from the U.S. of<br>
bamyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli), late watergrass (Echinochloa oryzicola), early<br>
watergrass (Echinochloa oryioides) and junglerice (Echinochloa colona} were planted into<br>
one 16-cm pot for each rate. Plantings were sequential so that crop and weed species were at<br>
the 2.0 to 2.5-leaf stage at time of treatment.<br>
Potted plants were grown in a greenhouse with day/night temperature settings of<br>
29.5/26.7 °C, and supplemental balanced lighting was provided to maintain a 16-hour<br>
photoperiod. Test pots were maintained in the greenhouse until test completion.<br>
At time of treatment, test pots were flooded to 3 cm above the soil surface, treated by<br>
application of test compounds directly to the paddy water, and then maintained at that water<br>
depth for the duration of the test. Effects of treatments on rice and weeds were visually<br>
evaluated by comparison to untreated controls after 21 days. Plant response ratings,<br>
summarized in Table E, are based on a scale of 0 to 100 where 0 is no effect and 100 is<br>
complete control. A dash (—)• response means no test result.<br>

TESTH<br>
This test evaluated the effect of mixtures of compound 1 with diflufenzopyr on several<br>
plant species. Seeds of test plants consisting of large crabgrass (DIGSA, Digitaria<br>
sanguinalis (L.) Scop.), lambsquarters (CHEAL, Chenopodium album L.), redroot pigweed<br>
(AMARE, Amaranthus retroflexus 'L.), cocklebur (XANST, Xanthium strumarium L.),<br>
bamyardgrass (ECHCG; Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) Beauv.), com (ZEAMD, Zea mays L.<br>
cv. 'Pioneer 33G26'), scarlet (red) morningglory (IPOCO, Ipomoea cocdnea L.), giant<br>
foxtail (SETFA, Setaria faberi Hemn.) and velvefleaf (ABUTH, Abutilon theophrasti<br>
Medik.) were planted in pots containing Redi-Earth® planting medium (Scotts Company,<br>
14111 Scottslawn Road, Marysville, Ohio 43041) comprising spaghnum peat moss,<br>
venniculite, wetting agent and starter nutrients. Seeds of small-seeded species were planted<br>
about 1 cm deep; largetr seeds were planted about 2.5 cm deep. Plants were grown in a<br>
greenhouse using supplemental lighting to maintain a photoperiod of about 14 hours;<br>
daytime and nighttime temperatures were about 25-30 °C and 22-25 °C, respectively.<br>
Balanced fertilizer was applied through the watering system. The plants were grown for 7<br>
to 11 days so that at time of treatment the plants ranged in height from 2 to 18 cm (1- to 4-<br>
leaf stage). Treatments consisted of Compound 1 and diflufenzopyr alone and in<br>
combination, suspended or dissolved in an aqueous solvent comprising glycerin and Tween<br>
nonionic surfactant and applied as a foliage spray using a volume of 541 L/ha. Each<br>
treatment was replicated four times. The application solvent was observed to have no effect<br>
compared to untreated check plants. Treated plants and controls were maintained in the<br>
greenhouse and watered as needed with care to not wet the foliage for the first 24 hours after<br>
treatment. The effects on the plants' approximately 3 weeks after treatment were visually<br>
compared to untreated controls. Plant response ratings were calculated as the means of the<br>
four replicates, based on a scale of 0 to 100 where 0 is no effect and 100 is complete control.<br>
Colby's Equation was used to determine the herbicidal effects expected from the mixtures.<br>
Colby's Equation (Colby, S. R. "Calculating Synergistic and Antagonistic Responses of<br>
Herbicide Combinations," Weeds, 15(1), pp 20-22 (1967)) calculates the expected additive<br>
effect of herbicidal mixtures, and for two active ingredients is of the form:<br>
wherein Pa+b is the percentage effect of the mixture expected from additive<br>
contribution of the individual components,<br>
Pa is the observed percentage effect of the first active ingredient at the same use<br>
rate as in the mixture, and<br>
Pb is the observed percentage effect of the second active ingredient at the same use<br>
rate as in the mixture.<br>
The results and additive effects expected from Colby's Equation are listed in Table H.<br>

* Application rates are grams of active ingredient per hectare (g a.i./ha). "Obsd." is observed effect "Exp."<br>
is expected effect calculated from Colby's Equation.<br>
As can be seen from the results listed in Table H, most of the observed results were<br>
greater than expected from the Colby Equation, and in some cases much greater. Most<br>
notable was the greater than additive effect observed on crabgrass, barnyardgrass, com and<br>
giant foxtail. The increase was less noticeable for other test species, but primarily because<br>
the expected effect was already near 100% at the rates tested.<br>
TEST I<br>
This test evaluated the effect of mixtures of compound 9 with metsulfuron-methyl and<br>
with a 5:1 by weight combination of chlorsulfuron and metsulfuron-methyl on several plant<br>
species. Seeds of test plants consisting of wheat (TRZAW; Triticum aestivum), wild<br>
buckwheat, (POLCO; Polygonum convolvulus), redroot pigweed (AMARE; Amaranthus<br>
retroflexus), wild mustard (SINAR; Sinapis arvensis), catchweed bedstraw (GALAP;<br>
Galium aparine), Russian thistle (SASKR; Salsola kali), common chickweed (STEME;<br>
Stellaria media), kochia (KCHSC; Kochia scoparia), and lambsquarters (CHEAL;<br>
Chenopodium album) were planted into a blend of loam soil and sand. Plants were grown in<br>
a greenhouse using supplemental lighting to maintain a photoperiod of about 14 hours;<br>
daytime and nighttime temperatures were about 23 °C and 16 °C, respectively. Balanced<br>
fertilizer was applied through the watering system. The plants were grown for 10 to 23 days<br>
so that at time of treatment the plants ranged from 2- to 8-leaf stage. Treatments consisted<br>
of Compound 9, metsulfuron-methyl, and chlorsulfuron-metsulfuron-methyl (5:1) alone and<br>
in combination. The treatments were formulated in a non-phytotoxic solvent mixture which<br>
included a surfactant and applied as a foliage spray using a volume of 28CM58 L/ha. Each<br>
treatment was replicated three times. The application solvent was observed to have no effect<br>
compared to untreated check plants. Treated plants and controls were maintained in the<br>
greenhouse and watered as needed with care to not wet the foliage for the first 24 hours after<br>
treatment. The effects on the plants approximately 17 days after treatment were visually<br>
compared to untreated controls. Plant response ratings were calculated as the means of the<br>
.three replicates, based on a scale of 0 to 100 where 0 is no effect and 100 is complete<br>
control. Colby's Equation was used to determine the herbicidal effects expected from the<br>
mixtures. The results and additive effects expected from Colby's Equation are listed in<br>

In addition, observed results for nearly all treatments on wheat were less than expected<br>
from the Colby Equation, suggesting crop safening.<br>
TEST;<br>
This test evaluated the effect of mixtures of compound 58 with azimsulfuron on<br>
several plant species. Three plastic pots (ca. 16-cm diameter) per rate were partially filled<br>
with sterilized Tama silt loam soil comprising a 35:50:15 ratio of sand, silt and clay and<br>
2.6% organic matter. Separate plantings for each of the three pots were as follows. Seeds<br>
from the U.S. of ducksalad (HETLI; Heterantiiera limosa), smallflower umbrella sedge<br>
 (CYPDI; Cyperus difformis) and purple redstem (AMMCO; Ammanma cocanea), were<br>
planted into one 16-cm pot for each rate. Seeds from the U.S. of bearded sprangletop<br>
(LEFUF; Leptochloa fusca ssp. fascicularis), one stand of 9 or 10 water-seeded rice<br>
seedlings (ORYSW; Oryza sativa cv. 'Japonica - M202'), and one stand of 6 transplanted<br>
rice seedlings (ORYSP; Oryza sativa cv. 'Japonica - M202') were planted into one 16-cm<br>
pot for each rate. Seeds from the U.S. of barnyardgrass (ECHCG; Echinochloa crus-galli),<br>
late watergrass (ECOR2; Echinochloa oryzicold), early watergrass (ECHOR; Echinochloa<br>
oiyzoides) and junglerice (ECHCO; Echinochloa colond) were planted into one 16-cm pot<br>
for each rate. Plantings were sequential so that crop and weed species were at the 2.0 to 2.5-<br>
leaf stage at time of treatment.<br>
Potted plants were grown in a greenhouse with day/night temperature settings of<br>
29.5/26.7 °C, and supplemental balanced lighting was provided to maintain a 16-hour<br>
photoperiod. Test pots were maintained in the greenhouse until test completion.<br>
At time of treatment, test pots were flooded to 3 cm above the soil surface and then<br>
treated by application directly to the paddy water of test compounds formulated in a nonphytotoxic<br>
solvent mixture which included a surfactant. The pots were maintained at the<br>
3-cm water depth for the duration of the test. Treatments consisted of compound 58 and<br>
azimsulfuron alone and in combination. ' Effects of treatments on rice and weeds were<br>
visually evaluated by comparison to untreated controls after 21 days. Plant response ratings<br>
were calculated as the means of the three replicates and are summarized in Table J. The<br>
ratings are based on a scale of 0 to 100 where 0 is no effect and 100 is complete control. A<br>

As can be seen from Table K, while chlorosulfuron had little effect on the<br>
sulfonylurea-resistant biotype of Galium aparine in this test, Compounds 1 and 9 gave good<br>
control of both resistant and susceptible biotypes.<br>
This field study included treatments that consisted of Compound 1 and nicosulfuron<br>
alone and in combination on Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense) and daisy fleabane (Erigeron<br>
spp.). The plants ranged from 20 to 30 cm in height at the lime of application during the<br>
month of May in the vicinity of Newark, Delaware. Compound 1 was formulated as a<br>
wettable powder containing 25% active ingredient by weight. Nicosulfuron was in the form<br>
of Accent® Herbicide, a water-dispersible granule formulation containing 75% active<br>
ingredient by weight. The formulations were dispersed in water in the sprayer tank before<br>
treatment. The treatments were made using a backpack sprayer calibrated to deliver 24<br>
gallons per acre (224 L per hectare) to a 10 ft x 30 ft (3 m x 9 m) plot. Each treatment was<br>
replicated two times. The effects on the plants approximately 56 days after treatment were<br>
visually compared to untreated controls. Plant response ratings were calculated as the means<br>
of the two replicates, based on a scale of 0 to 100 where 0 is no effect and 100 is complete<br>
control. Colby's Equation was used to determine the herbicidal effects expected from the<br>
mixture. The results and additive effects expected from Colby's Equation are listed in<br>
