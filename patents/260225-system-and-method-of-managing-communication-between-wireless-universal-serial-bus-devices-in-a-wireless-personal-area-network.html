				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of wireless networks. Further, this invention relates to medium access control for wireless personal area networks (WPAN) that are based on wireless mobile ad-hoc networks. It relates to the medium access control (MAC) for wireless universal serial bus (WUSB). Particularly, this invention relates to the medium access control functionality of wireless universal serial bus host. Specifically, this invention relates to communication between WUSB devices. More specifically, it relates the communication between WUSB devices by a new type of WUSB system. Also, this invention encompasses a system and method for communication between wireless universal serial bus devices in wireless personal area networks based on ultra wide band (UWB) systems. More particularly, the present invention relates to system and method for WUSB peer to peer communication.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
The wireless personal area networks are defined to operate in the personal operating space, i.e. in a range of approximately 10 meters. The WiMedia Alliance (http://www.wimedia.org) is involved in defining standards for such wireless personal area networks. The Ultra Wide Band (UWB) technology can provide data rates exceeding several hundreds of Mbps in this personal operating space. In wireless personal area networks, the medium is shared between all the devices for communication with each other. This necessitates a medium access control<br><br>
 mechanism for the devices to manage medium access, broadly including how it may join the network, how it can transfer data at the required rate to another device, how the medium is best used, how to detect and resolve beacon collisions etc.<br>
Medium access control for wireless personal area networks is designed in distributed manner. The medium access operations are distributed evenly across all devices in the network and all the devices share the load of managing medium access operations for each other. Wireless personal area network is based on distributed approach and does not have any centralized coordinator. It involves a decentralized WPAN, in which devices are light coordinator and there is no dedicated coordinator present. All devices cooperate and share information with each other to perform the medium access control tasks such as allowing a new device to join, allocation of channel time to a device to transmit data to another device, synchronization mechanisms etc. This is a Distributed WPAN system which is formed in an ad-hoc fashion. Each device periodically broadcasts the information about its neighbors and allocated channel time to its neighbors.<br>
The Distributed medium access control approach relies on a timing concept called the Superframe. Superframe has a fixed length in time and is divided into a number of time windows which are called time slots. Some of the time slots are used by the devices to send their beacons and the other are used by the devices to send the data. The slots in which beacon is sent are called beacon slots and the slots in which data is sent are called data slots. The length of a beacon period may be less than the length of a data period. The beacon slots may be distributed<br><br>
across the slots in the superframe or may appear together at the start of the superframe. In addition, the number of beacon slots may be fixed or variable leading to different configurations of Distributed Medium Access Control mechanisms.<br>
The superframe structure is specified by the WiMedia MAC. It consists of several Medium Access Slots (As an example, the number is shown as 256). Some Medium Access Slots (MAS) constitute beacon period (comprising of beacon slots corresponding to multiple devices) and remaining MASs constitute data period (comprising of data slots that may be used by different devices in the network to transmit data to other devices in the network), employs a superframe duration of 65,536 micro-second with 256 MASs, and each MAS is of 256 microsecond duration. Information about superframe is being broadcasted by each device in its broadcasted beacons, so neighbors of that device can use that information for further processing. The start time of the superframe is determined by the beginning of the beacon period and defined as the beacon period start time (BPST).<br>
Devices that belong to the same beacon period shall utilize the same BPST for the superframe. However, some of the devices may define a different time as their BPST. In such case, 2 or more beacon groups may coexist for the device. MASs are numbered relative to this starting time. The devices shall transform the numbering of MASs of other beaconing periods into the time reference of their<br><br>
1<br>
main beaconing period. A device can be part of several beaconing periods but has to select one beaconing period as its main beaconing period.<br>
MASs can be reserved through Distributed Reservation Protocol (DRP). The reservation can be of different reservation type like Hard, Soft, PCA (Prioritized Contention Access) or Private. All reservation type uses different access method to access the channel. Private reservation type does not define any access method; it is up to the implementation to use an access method in private reservation. Each device which is target of the reservation or owner of the reservation sends a DRP IE in their beacon.<br>
Private reservation is used by Wireless USB for its communication over WiMedia based UWB channel. Wireless USB being a central entity reserve private reservation in which other devices can work over the reservation. WiMedia MAC also defines a channel access method called Prioritized Contention Access (PCA). This can be used in reservation of type PCA or any unreserved time in superframe.<br>
Device uses 16 bit device address (DevAddr) as an addressing entity. Two type of addressing is defined by WiMedia MAC. Address called generated address is generated by the device randomly. If same address found in neighborhood being used by some other device then address will be generated again, this procedure is called address conflict resolution. Another type of address called Private address, which is not generated by the device, but assigned by some other mean.<br><br>
Wireless USB uses generated address for WUSB devices which is assigned by WUSB Host.<br>
USB is one of the most successful PC peripheral protocols. Wireless USB is a wireless extension of the USB protocol, which uses WiMedia common radio platform as physical medium. Today wireless USB can be used for different kind of applications like PC peripheral, consumer electronics, handheld device to device connection etc.<br>
Any WUSB node is generally defined as WUSB Host or as WUSB Device. WUSB Host is a coordinator of the WUSB topology and controls the functions of WUSB devices connected to it. Generally WUSB Host is part of PC or device which has enough memory and power capability. WUSB Host is responsible for managing the connections with device; any kind of communication; channel access mechanism; scheduling of traffic; interference mitigation; and WiMedia common radio platform related functionality. WUSB Host creates a private reservation according to WiMedia MAC, which is called WUSB Channel that is used for any WUSB related communications between the host and its devices. WUSB device connects to a WUSB Host for any communication. WUSB devices are generally categorized as small and mobile devices. WUSB devices have more than one communication pipes with WUSB Host for control and data transfers. It uses information provided by WUSB Host to interact with the host. WUSB device may or may not implement all functionality of WiMedia common radio platform.<br><br>
V<br>
According to current WUSB specification WUSB topology is a centralized topology, where WUSB Host is a central controlling entity. WUSB devices can connect to WUSB Host for any type of communication. Physical interference can be managed by services provided by WiMedia common radio platform.<br>
WUSB Hosts sends Micro-scheduled Management Command (MMC) in WUSB Channel periodically. MMC is control message from WUSB Host to WUSB devices around. MMC contains different type of information elements (IE) to perform different type of operations and to provide different information to devices. WUSB device uses information in MMC for connection establishment; channel time allocation for transmission and reception of data; and any other control and data operations.<br>
WUSB device initiates the connection with WUSB Host from the information provided by the WUSB Host in its MMC. WUSB Host provides the channel time of WUSB Channel for new device to send connection request message. WUSB Device and Host exchange messages for connection establishment and authentication. After successful negotiation device is considered to be in 'connected and authenticated' state. WUSB Host provides an address to the newly connected WUSB device from WiMedia MAC'S private address range.<br>
Exact time and duration of the data transmission from any direction is allocated by WUSB Host, which is given via Device Transmit CTA (DtCTA) and Device Receive CTA (DrCTA).<br><br>
Related art provides a method to schedule Peer CTA (PCTA). The WUSB host is responsible for allocating the PCTA. During the PCTA time one device communicates with another device which is not a host.<br>
Related art provides a method to send P2P IE is used by the host to broadcast P2P related information in the MMC. By including a P2P IE the host can indicate that it is capable of supporting P2P communication via PCTA. P2P IE also has various sub types which are identified by a one byte filed called sub type in the IE. The present state of art in this field has following limitations.<br>
—	There is no way in current art that a WUSB device can communicate with another WUSB device.<br>
—	All the communication has to pass through WUSB host which is overhead.<br>
