The present invention relates to the field of machining of hard metallic materials by cutting (e.g., shaping parts by removing excess material in the form of chips) with hard cutting tools, and more particularly to machining methods that reduce the thickness of a thermomechanically-affected layer (e.g., white layer) on as-machined surfaces of hard metal workpieces and/or mitigate the detrimental effects in machined surfaces of hard metal workplaces due to the thermomechanical load of a hard cutting tool machining the workpiece.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Specifically, the invention concerns machining of hard metallic parts, characterized by the surface hardness exceeding 42 Rockwell on Scale C, with hard cutting tools, characterized by the edge hardness exceeding 1500 Vickers. Machining of hard or hardened metallic parts brings about significant cost savings to the manufacturing industries through the reduction of heat-treating and machining steps in the production cycle and minimizing the extent of slow, finish-grinding operations. With the advent of hard, ceramic cutting tools and tool coatings, which include alumina (A1203), cubic boron nitride (CBN) and many other advanced materials, machining of hard metals has become feasible and includes outer diameter (OD) turning, inner diameter turning (boring), grooving, parting, facing, milling, drilling, and numerous other cutting operations.<br>
A significant limitation of the widespread use of hard metal machining is the so-called "white layer" effect, a microscopic alteration of the as-machined surface of a workpiece, which effect is produced in response to an extremely high thermomechanical load exerted at the as-machined surface by the cutting tool. Although not fully understood, the thermomechanically-affected workpiece surface comprising an etching-resistant white layer is undesired because of associated tensile stresses, e.g., reduced fatigue-resistance, lower fracture toughness, and/or reduced wear resistance of parts produced. See, B. J. Griffins, White Layer Formation at Machined Surfaces and Their Relationship to White Layer Formations at Worn Surfaces, J. of Tribology, April 1985, Vol. 107/165.<br><br>
It has been reported that a sharper and/or not worn cutting edge, as well as the conventional flooding of a cutting tool with a water-based, emulsified oil coolant, contribute to the reduction in the detrimental tensile stresses and white layer. W. Konig, M. Klinger, and R. Link, Machining Hard Materials with Geometrically Defined Cutting Edges-Field of Applications and Limitations, Annals of CIRP 1990, Vol. 57, pp. 61-64. Hard machining with conventional flood cooling has been reexamined but found to be ineffective. H. K. Tonshoff and H. G. Wobker, Potential and Limitations of Hard Turning, 1st Int. Machining and Grinding Conf., Sep. 12-14,1995, Dearborn, Mich,, SME Technical Paper MR95-215. Moreover, sharp-finished cutting edges easily fracture in the case of inexpensive, A^C^-based tools, leaving expensive CBN tools as the only current option. It has been noted that the use of coolants in hard machining should be avoided since cooling accelerates the edge wear and shortens overall life of CBN tools used for finish-hardturning. T. J. Broskea, PCBN Tool Failure Mode Analysis, Intertech 2000, Vancouver B. C, Canada, Jul. 17-21,2000. Numerous other publications and machining textbooks have indicated that the use of coolants with inexpensive AI2O3 tools brings about a rapid fracture. Using non-cooled CBN tools (dry turning), the effect of cutting speed on white layer thickness during hardturning of a popular hardened bearing steel 52100 has been examined. Y. K. Chou and C. J. Evans, Process Effects on White Layer Formation in Hard Turning, Trans, of NAMRI/SME, Vol. XXVI, 1998, pp.117-122. Results showed that only relatively low cutting speeds, translating into reduced productivity rates, assure an acceptably thin white layer. Thus, the machining technology of today offers no solution for making hard, white layer-free parts quickly and at reduced costs.<br>
It is desired to have an apparatus and a method which minimize the alteration of workpiece surfaces during hard machining, and more specifically, which eliminate or minimize tensile and/or fluctuating surface stresses and etch-resistant white layer (i.e., the detrimental effects of "white layer").<br>
It is further desired to have an apparatus and method which produce better parts having less of the detrimental effects of a thermomechanically-affected layer (e.g., "white layer")<br><br>
and which do so faster, at lower costs, and with less expensive tools.<br>

Applicants' invention is an apparatus and a method for reducing a thickness of a thermomechanically-affected layer on an as-machined surface of a hard metal workpiece, and an apparatus and a method for mitigating a detrimental effect of a thermomechanical load in a machined surface of a hard metal workpiece. Another aspect of the invention is an apparatus and a method for machining a hard metal workpiece using the aforesaid apparatuses and methods. Other aspects of the invention are the workpieces machined by the apparatus and method for machining.<br>
A first embodiment of the method for reducing a thickness of a thermomechanically-affected layer on an as-machined surface of a hard metal workpiece being machined by a hard cutting tool exerting a thermomechanical load on a surface of the workpiece includes reducing the thermomechanical load.<br>
There are several variations of the first embodiment of that method. In one variation, the hard metal workpiece includes an iron-containing alloy.

In another variation of the method, at least a portion of the thermomechanical load is a component of a cutting force, the component being applied in a direction normal to the surface of the workpiece, and the thermomechanical load is reduced by reducing the component of the cutting force. There are several variants of this variation. In one variant, the cutting tool has an inclination angle, and the component of the cutting force is reduced by making the inclination angle more positive.

The first step of the method is to cool the cutting tool to a second temperature lower than the first temperature before the cutting tool contacts the surface of the workpiece or while the workpiece is being machined. The second step is to reduce the component of the cutting force.<br>
A first embodiment of the method for mitigating a detrimental effect of a thermomechanical load in a machined surface of a hard metal workpiece, the thermomechanical load being exerted on a surface of the workpiece by a hard cutting tool machining the workpiece, thereby forming the machined surface, includes cooling the machined surface by a cooling means having an initial temperature in a range of about -250° C. to about+25° C.<br><br>
There are several variations of the first embodiment of that method. In one variation, the cooling means includes at least one inert, water-free coolant. In another variation, the cooling means includes at least one stream containing a cryogenic fluid or at least one ice particle having a temperature less than about -75° C. In another variation, the hard metal workpiece includes an iron-containing alloy.

In a third embodiment of the method for mitigating the detrimental effect, which is similar to the first embodiment, at least a portion of the thermomechanical load is a component of a cutting force, the component being applied in a direction normal to the surface of the workpiece. The method in this third embodiment includes reducing the component of the cutting force. In a variation of this embodiment, wherein the cutting tool has an inclination angle, the component of the cutting force is reduced by making the inclination angle more positive and the cooling means includes at least one stream containing a cryogenic fluid or at least one ice particle having a temperature less than about-75° C.<br>
A fourth embodiment of the method for mitigating the detrimental effect is similar to the third embodiment, but includes cooling the cutting tool simultaneously by the cooling means. In a variation of the fourth embodiment, wherein the cutting tool has an inclination angle, the component of the cutting force is reduced by making the inclination angle more positive and the cooling means includes at least one stream containing a cryogenic fluid with at least one ice particle having a temperature less than about -75° C.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention involves machining hard metallic workpieces with hard cutting tools using a method which reduces the thickness of, or eliminates, thermomechanically-affected layers, including but not limited to white layer, and allows cutting at higher speeds without an excessive white layer using CBN tool materials, as well as less expensive AI2O3, carbide, cermet, or other hard tool materials. As used hereinafter, the term "white layer" refers to all types of "thermomechanically-affected layers," including but not limited to those associated with surface tensile stresses (e.g., reduced fatigue-resistance, lower fracture toughness, and/or reduced wear resistance).<br>
According to the present invention, the thermomechanical load exerted by the cutting tool<br><br>
at the machined surface is reduced using one or a combination of the three techniques (A, B, C) discussed below.<br>
A.	Cooling cutting tool with a precisely aimed jet or spray of inert, water-free coolant, so<br>
that the heat transferred from the hot tool interface to the workpiece is reduced and, most<br>
preferably, the tool becomes a heat sink for the workpiece surface.<br>
The temperature of the tool cooling jet may vary between +25° C. and -250° C, with the lower, cryogenic jet temperatures preferred. The tool cooled with such a jet makes the surface of a machined part colder. In addition, as observed during hard machining tests, in contrast to conventional machining technology teachings, the use of inert and water-free cooling jets enhances the life of AI2O3, CBN and other, hard cutting tools and, consequently, allows the use of sharper cutting edges which generate lower cutting forces and thinner white layers.<br>
B.	Cooling the as-formed or as-machined workpiece surface with the same type of direct<br>
impinging cooling jet or spray as in technique A.<br>
Based on observations, it appears that cooling of the as-machined workpiece surface reduces the depth of heat penetration into machined material and, consequently, the extent of undesired material transformations. The surface-cooling jet of technique B may be separate from the tool-cooling jet of technique A; or just a single jet can be aimed in such a way that it cools both the tool and the surface simultaneously. Persons skilled in the art will recognize that multiple cooling jets or sprays of technique A and technique B could be used according to the present invention.<br>
C.	Reducing the cutting force component in the direction normal to the as-machined<br>
workpiece surface.<br>
As observed during tests, the cutting force component normal to the as-machined workpiece surface appears to be a significant source of heat flux entering the surface and<br><br>
generating white layer. In the case of the most frequently practiced OD-hardturning operations, where the normal force is the radial force, a more positive tool inclination angle results in a reduced thermomechanical load entering the surface. In the case of orthogonal cutting, where the normal force is the feed force, a more positive rake angle will be more important. In the most generic cutting case, both the inclination angle and the rake angle are made more positive than the conventional, negative values that are used in current hard machining operations. Since the life of hard cutting tools scales inversely with the positive inclination and rake angle, the increase in the value of these angles is most advantageous if practiced in combination with technique A, which also enhances tool life during hard machining.<br>
FIG. 1A is a schematic diagram of an OD-hardturning operation involving a solid barstock as the workpiece 12 and a round cutting tool 14 (with a cutting insert marked as CT) viewed from the topside of the tool rake surface. This view is referred to as the X-Z plane view. The X-Z projection of the major cutting forces that have to be applied to the workpiece via the cutting tool is denoted as Fxz feed or feed force, and Fxz radial or radial force, where the feed force is less than the radial force. The location of the thermomechanically-affected layers 16 on the as-machined surface of the workpiece is illustrated In FIG. 1 A. The detail on the right of the figure shows a cross-sectional view of the typical subsurface microstructure of the as-machined workpiece that can be observed under a scanning electron microscope (SEM) using magnifications ranging from 3,000 to 12,000 times. The following designations are used: OS-outer surface that was in direct contact with the cutting tool during hardturning, WL—white layer, DL—dark layer, and BM—base metal representing the parent or unaffected structure of the barstock.<br>
Based on SEM examinations carried out on a popular bearing steel grade, AISI52100 (1 wt % C and 1.5 wt % Cr), hardened to 61 Rockwell on scale C and hard machined, the white layer (WL) is a thin band of poorly etching material with broadly dispersed, spherical carbides. The underlying dark layer (DL) is thicker than the white layer, and contains more and bigger carbide particles, as well as microfeatures suggesting martensitic needles and latches. The thermomechanically-affected layer includes both the<br><br>
white layer (WL) and the dark layer (DL) but also extends even deeper into the base metal and cannot be measured using simple microscopic methods. Consequently, the evaluation of the thickness of a thermomechanically-affected layer is usually based on (1) a microscopic measurement of the well contrasting white layer (WL), combined with (2) additional measurements of the mechanical properties of the material below the as-machined surface, e.g., residual stress and microhardness measurements.<br>
FIG. IB shows the same X-Z view of the cutting tool 14 and the workpiece 12 (barstock), but does not include the cross-sectional details of the subsurface microstructure as in FIG. 1A. Points CJXZ1 and CJXZ2 are X-Z plane projections of the preferred locations of cold jet-discharging orifices (not shown) that aim the cooling jets (18, 20) at the rake of the cutting tool, at the as-machined surface of the workpiece and, optionally, into the clearance gap between the cutting tool and the workpiece surface, just below the rake surface and the cutting tool-workpiece contact area. Thus, the cold jet impact is limited to the cutting tool and the as-machined workpiece surface area. It is important not to cool the barstock upstream of the cutting tool, since such cooling increases the mechanical energy required for cutting, i.e., cancels the cooling effect and simultaneously shortens the life of the cutting tool. As shown in FIG. IB, the CJXZ1 jet may be positioned higher or lower, above the rake along the Y-axis, and may impact only the rake surface along the contact length. This represents technique A, discussed earlier. Alternatively, the CJXZ1 jet may spray both the rake and the as-machined surface downstream of the cutting tool. This alternate approach combines techniques A and B. The 0^2 jet may be positioned behind or below the cutting tool, along the Y and the Z axes, in order to work according to technique B. The CJXZ2 jet can be eliminated as well if the spray 18 from the CJXZ1 jet is sufficiently effective in cooling the machined surface. The results of comparative tests carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of techniques A, B, and C are summarized in Table 1, which details the conditions of the tests.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
FIG. 2 shows the results of SEM measurements of the white layer thickness for eight (8) test conditions. The results show that the sharper and more conductive CBN tool tends to produce a thinner white layer than that produced by the AI2O3 tool. The reduction of the normal component of the cutting force coming with the sharper tools, and the reduction of tool temperature with more conductive tool materials, are consistent with our techniques A and C. However, the most significant factor in reducing white layer thickness was the cooling jet applied according to techniques A and B, which was capable of reducing the white layer by about 40% regardless of the tool and cutting speed used. The most Important and surprising finding is that the white layer produced with the jet-cooled AI2O3 tool is significantly thinner than the white layer produced by the CBN tool operated the conventional way (i.e., dry). Moreover, the white layer produced with the AI2O3 tool at 700 feet/minute is thinner than the white layer produced with the dry CBN tool at 400 ft/minute. Thus, the present invention enables hard machining operators to produce better parts faster and at lower tooling cost.<br>
FIG. 3 A shows the change of subsurface hardness as a result of hardturning with the CBN and AI2O3 tools at the cutting speed of 700 feet/minute. Undesired softening of workpiece material observed within the first 15 micrometers under the as-machined surface after the conventional dry hardturning is prevented when the cryogenic cooling jet is used according to techniques A and B of the Invention.<br>
FIG. 3B plots results of residual stress measurements on the same four types of samples as in FIG. 3A. In the case of AI2O3, the cryojet cooling eliminates a steep tensile stress resulting from the conventional dry hardturning. In the case of CBN, the cryojet makes the subsurface stress slightly more compressive and, just as in the case of AI2O3, flattens the fluctuation of stress with depth. Both FIGS. 3A and 3B show that the techniques A and B of the invention bring an unexpected improvement in the mechanical properties of a hard machined surface.<br>
As FIG. IB presented the X-Z plane view of OD-hardturning, FIGS. 4A, 4B and 4C present the same operation but in the X-Y plane showing a section of the face of the<br><br>
barstock or workpiece 12 and the side of the cutting insert (CT). FIG. 4A shows the conventional method of hardturning where the Inclination angle A--0--B is negative. The X-Y projection of the work-material reaction force that resists machining operation, Rxymach, can be presented with some degree of simplification as a sum of two forces projected on the same plane X-Y: tangential reaction cutting force, Rxytan, and radial reaction force, Rxyrad. The radial reaction force is larger than zero, usually larger than the tangential or the feed force (extending along the Z-axis), and in some hardturning cases larger than the tangential and feed forces combined. To balance the radial reaction force, the radial force applied via the cutting tool to the workplace surface, Fxzrad, must be equally large, which leads to a high thermomechanical load being applied by the cutting tool to the workpiece surface and contributes to the formation of thick white layers.<br>
FIG. 4B presents a modification of the conventional cutting geometry (in FIG. 4A) as the inclination angle, B--0--C, is increased from the initial negative value (represented by A--0--B) in FIG. 4 A to a new positive value, which results in reversing the direction of the radial reaction force, Rxyrad. In effect, the increased or more positive inclination angle reduces the required radial force of the cutting tool to zero or below zero, resulting in a reduction of the thermomechanically-affected layer at the workpiece surface. This modification of the cutting geometry represents technique C of the present invention. This technique may be extended to hard facing and hard orthogonal cutting operations where, if effective rake angles are made more positive than the conventionally used negative angles, then the thermomechanical load at the workpiece surface is reduced, and the thermomechanically-affected layer is thinner.<br>
The increased inclination and/or rake angles may produce tensile stresses around the cutting edges of typically brittle tools used in hard machining. Such tensile stresses may lead to premature tool failures in the case of the conventional technology that teaches dry cutting conditions. As observed, the failures are less frequent and tool life is extended when at least one cooling jet or spray is aimed at the rake of the cutting tool during hard machining, and the cooling fluid used is inert, water-free, and preferably cryogenic. (The term "inert" means that the cooling fluid does not react with the hard metal and does not<br><br>
degrade the mechanical properties of the hard metal or the hard cutting tool.)<br>
FIG. 4C shows the X-Y plane projection of two cooling Jets, CJxyl and CJxy2, corresponding to the jets shown in FIG. IB in the X-Z plane view. The application of technique C is most advantageous from the production and cost standpoint, when CJ1 or, alternatively, CJ1 and CJ2 are spraying coolant during the hard cutting, as shown In FIG. 4C.<br>
The present invention minimizes detrimental white layer and other thermomechanically-affected layers in an as-machined workpiece surface by reducing the thermomechanical load exerted by the cutting tool on the workpiece material surface during hard machining. As discussed above, the present invention includes three techniques (A, B, C) which may be used separately or in combination (AB, AC, BC, ABC).<br>
Although illustrated and described herein with reference to certain specific embodiments, the present invention is nevertheless not intended to be limited to the details shown. Rather, various modifications may be made in the details within the scope and range of equivalents of the claims and without departing from the spirit of the invention.<br><br><br>
