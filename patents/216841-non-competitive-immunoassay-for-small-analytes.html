	Non-competitive immunoassay for small analytes<br>
	Field or the Invention<br>
		The present invention relates to immunoassays and especially to<br>
5	non-competitive immunoassays for small analyies. The present invention fur-<br>
	ther relates to reagent pairs and test-kits useful in the assays, as well as to the<br>
	use of the reagent pairs and to a process for their preparation. Novel reagents<br>
	and means for their preparation are also provided.<br>
10	Technical Background of the Invention<br>
		In a competitive immunoassay, external reagent that competes with<br>
	the analyte has to be added, which is not the case in the non-competitive as-<br>
	say format. The method of choice for the detection of analytes by immuno-<br>
	chemistry is nowadays a non-competitive immunoassay, where two antibodies<br>
15	bind to two different epitopes of the analyte creating a so-called sandwich-type<br>
	assay. Such an assay is well suited for high molecular weight analytes and it<br>
	provides improved speed, sensitivity, and specificity, which are needed in<br>
	modern immunoassays. However, it has been a difficult task to develop non-<br>
	competitive assays for small analytes, because low molecular weight mo-<br>
20	lecules are not large enough for binding simultaneously to more than one anti-<br>
	body independently. Therefore, despite many fundamental problems with re-<br>
	spect to specificity and sensitivity, the competitive immunoassay format has<br>
	been almost exclusively used for the detection of small analytes.<br>
		However, there are few publications where the development of a<br>
25	non-competitive immunoassay for a small analyte has been reported. In these<br>
	papers, a secondary anti-immune complex (anti-IC) antibody, which binds<br>
	primary anti-analyte antibody that is combined with the analyte but which does<br>
	not bind the primary antibody or the analyte alone, has been developed (Ull-<br>
	man et al., 1993; Self et al., 1994; Towbin et al., 1995). Ullman ef al., 1993,<br>
30	describe an antibody that recognizes an immune complex of an antibody to<br>
	tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The anti-IC antibody was obtained by using an<br>
	affinity labelled anti-THC antibody as immunogen and selecting an anti-IC anti-<br>
	body the binding of which was enhanced by the presence of 9THC. Self et<br>
	al., 1994, used the same principle in preparing anti-IC antibodies for determin-<br>
35	ing digoxin. Towbin et al., 1995, report a sandwich immunoassay for the<br>
	hapten angiotensin II, wherein the immunisation involves tolerization with un-<br><br><br>
2<br>
	complexed primary antibody prior to immunisation with the anti-immune com-<br>
	plex to obtain the anti-IC antibodies. The anti-IC antibodies used in non-com-<br>
	petitive immunoassays for small analytes have so far been conventional poly-<br>
	clonal or monoclonal antibodies obtained by immunisation, and the assays de-<br>
5	scribed here include labelling of the primary antibody and immobilisation of the<br>
	secondary or vice versa.<br>
		So-called 'idiometric' non-competitive immunoassay for small ana-<br>
	lytes has been developed by Mares et al., 1995. They used two types of anti-<br>
	idiotypic antibodies, which recognize different epitopes within the hypervari-<br>
10	able region of the oeastradiol specifc primary antibody. The first anti-idiotypic<br>
	antibody (betatype) possesses the capacity of competing with the analyte for<br>
	an epitope at the binding site of the primary antibody. The second anti-idiotype<br>
	(alphatype) recognizes an epitope within the variable region of the primary an-<br>
	tibody and the binding is not sensitive to the presence of the analyte. The al-<br>
15	phatype is, however, sterically hindered from binding to the primary antibody in<br>
	the presence of the betatype. These three types of antibodies permit the de-<br>
	velopment of a non-competitive assay for small analytes.<br>
		So-called open sandwich immunoassays have been developed for<br>
	the detection of haptens (Suzuki et al., 2000; Suzuki et al., 1999; Yokozeki et<br>
20	al, 2002). They are non-competitive assays based on a phenomenon accord-<br>
	ing to which the association of separated VH and VL chains in some antibodies<br>
	is strongly favoured in the presence of antigen (Ueda et al., 1996),<br>
		Despite the significant benefits of the non-competitive immunoas-<br>
	say format, only few examples of that kind of assays for small analytes have<br>
25	been reported. The reason for that is most probably the difficulty of producing<br>
	secondary (anti-immuno complex, or anti-idiotypic) antibodies by immunising<br>
	animals. For example anti-hapten monoclonal antibodies, which have been<br>
	developed by hybridoma technology (Kohler and Milstein, 1975), are self-anti-<br>
	gens for mice and raising immunoresponse against them is difficult<br>
30	(Maruyama et al., 2002; Ullman et al., 1993; Kobayashi et al., 2000), A further<br>
	problem is that the immune complex used for immunisation tends to break<br>
	down before the response to the immuno complex is obtained (Ullman et al.,<br>
	1993; Kobayashi et al.,2000).<br>
		The present invention now provides a non-competitive immunoas-<br>
35	say protocol for small analytes, which circumvents the immunisation of anim-<br>
	als with the immune complex, which has been so far the most challenging task<br><br><br>
3<br>
	when anti-IC antibodies have been developed. The invention also facilitates a<br>
	homogenous immunoassay, which further improves the speed, sensitivity and<br>
	simplicity of the assay.<br>
5	Summary of the Invention<br>
		The difficulties associated with raising anti-lC antibodies for use in<br>
	Immunoassays for small analytes can now be avoided by providing the neces-<br>
	sary anti-IC antibodies from a display recombinant binding partner library in-<br>
	stead of from immunised animals. A phage display antibody library may be<br>
10	constructed, which contains a vast number of clones, from which Those coding<br>
	the desired binding partners, such as antibody fragments, can be enriched and<br>
	selected through sequential panning. This protocol opens new possibilities for<br>
	developing rapid, reliable and simple immunoassays for small analytes in a<br>
	cost-effective and feasible way.<br>
15		Consequently, one object of the present invention is a non-compet-<br>
	itive immunoassay for a small analyte comprising reacting a sample containing<br>
	said analyte with a reagent pair comprising a first binding partner that binds to<br>
	said analyte, and a second binding partner that binds to the complex of said<br>
	analyte and said first binding partner. The immunoassay is characterized in<br>
20	that the second binding partner is obtained from a display recombinant binding<br>
	partner library by selecting a binding partner that binds to said complex of the<br>
	analyte and first binding partner, and determining the binding of the second<br>
	binding partner thus indicating the presence of the analyte in the sample.<br>
		Another object of the invention is a reagent pair for a non-competit-<br>
25	ive immunoassay for a small analyte, comprising a first binding partner that<br>
	binds to said analyte, and a second binding partner that binds to the complex<br>
	of said analyte and said first binding partner, characterized in that the second<br>
	binding partner is obtained from a display recombinant binding partner library<br>
	by selecting a binding partner that binds to said complex of the analyte and<br>
30	first binding partner.<br>
		Still another object of the present invention is a test kit for a non-<br>
	competitive immunoassay for a small analyte, said kit comprising a reagent<br>
	pair comprising a first binding partner that binds to said analyte, and a second<br>
	binding partner that binds to the complex of said analyte and said first binding<br>
35	partner, characterized in mat the second binding partner is obtained from a<br><br><br>
4<br>
	display recombinant binding partner library by selecting a binding partner that<br>
	binds to said complex of the analyte and first binding partner.<br>
		The invention Is also directed to the use of a reagent pair compris-<br>
	ing a first binding partner that binds to an analyte, and a second binding part-<br>
5	ner that binds to the complex of said analyte and said first binding partner, in a<br>
	non-competitive immunoassay for a small analyte, whereby the second bind-<br>
	ing partner is obtained from a display recombinant binding partner library by<br>
	selecting a binding partner that binds to said complex of the analyte and first<br>
	binding partner.<br>
10		A still further object of the invention is a process for preparing a re-<br>
	agent pair for a non-competitive immunoassay for a small analyte comprising<br>
	providing a first binding partner that binds to said analyte, and a second bind-<br>
	ing partner that binds to the complex of said analyte and said first binding part-<br>
	ner, characterized in that the second binding partner is obtained from a display<br>
15	recombinant binding partner library by selecting a binding partner that binds to<br>
	said complex of the analyte and first binding partner.<br>
		The invention also provides novel recombinant binding proteins,<br>
	characterized in that they comprise the ligand-binding portion of M1 Fab com-<br>
	prising SEQ ID NO 1 and SEQ ID NO 2; M2 Fab comprising SEQ ID NO 3 and<br>
20	SEQ ID NO 4: or K11 scFv comprising SEQ ID NO 5.<br>
		DNA encoding the novel binding proteins as well as host cells ex-<br>
	pressing them are also included in the invention.<br>
		Advantagous embodiments of the invention are set forth in the de-<br>
	pendent claims.<br>

5	Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
		The reagent pair for the non-competitive immunoassay of the inven-<br>
	tion comprises a first binding partner and a second binding partner. The first<br>
	binding partner binds to the analyte to form a complex between the first bind-<br>
	ing partner and the analyte. The second binding partner binds to the complex<br>
10	formed by the first binding partner and the analyte. The binding partners are<br>
	usually proteins such as antibodies including antibody fragments that have the<br>
	desired binding properties. An antibody is an immunoglobuiin molecule and it<br>
	can belong to any of classes IgG, IgM, IgE, IgA or IgD; lgG and IgM being the<br>
	most frequently used. Preferably the binding partners are antibody fragments<br>
15	comprising the Iigand-binding site, such as Fab, or scFv fragments. The frag-<br>
	ment known as the Fab fragment (fragment antigen binding) consists of the<br>
	variable and constant domain of an immunoglobulin light chain covalently at-<br>
	tached by a disulfide bridge to the variable and first constant domain of an im-<br>
	munoglobulin heavy chain. Fv (variable domain) means the variable regions of<br>
20	the immunoglobulin molecule that are responsible for the ligand binding. ScFv<br>
	(single chain Fv) means a molecule wherein the variable domains of the heavy<br>
	and light chain of an antibody are linked by a peptide to form a single poly-<br>
	peptide chain synthesized from a single mRNA molecule. The variable regions<br>
	of an immunoglobulin heavy chain and light chain are together responsible for<br>
25	the ligand binding. Ligand is the substance to which the binding partner binds,<br>
	in connection with antibodies it is an antigen or a hapten.<br>
		The first binding partner may be a conventional polyclonal or mono-<br>
	clonal antibody or fragment thereof, but preferably it is a recombinant one, as<br>
	is the second binding partner. When the first binding partner has been selec-<br>
30	ted for, it is complexed with its ligand and this complex is used to select for the<br>
	second binding partner from a recombinant library. The first binding partner<br>
	without the ligand is used as contra selection. The second binding partner<br>
	should only recognise complexes, not free first binding partner nor free antigen<br>
	to any significant extent.<br>
35		The recombinant binding partner library is conveniently an expres-<br>
	sion library, which is typically a display library. The general principle of the dis-<br><br><br>
6<br>
	play recombinant binding partner libraries is that they present the binding part-<br>
	ner as a fusion protein on the surface, which may be the surface of a microbial<br>
	cell such as a yeast or bacterial cell, or a phage. The display recombinant<br>
	binding partner library can also be a display library, where stable complexes of<br>
5	nascent protein and mRNA are produced in an in vitro expression system.<br>
	Phage display libraries are the most frequently used. Antibody phage display<br>
	technology and its applications are described e.g. in Hoogenboom et al., 1998.<br>
		A phage display antibody library may be constructed by cloning im-<br>
	mnunoglobulin domains coding cDNAs into an appropriate phage display vec-<br>
10	tor. DNA encoding for millions of variants of antibody fragments is batch-<br>
	cloned into the vector as part of the phage coat protein. Large libraries con-<br>
	taining millions of antibody fragments with different specificities can be ob-<br>
	tained by transforming the vectors in bacteria. Cultivation of the bacteria leads<br>
	to the expression of phages displaying antibody fragments on their surface.<br>
15	The gene for the displayed antibody is carried in the phage genome, thus link-<br>
	ing genotype with phenotype. The physical linkage between the displayed pro-<br>
	tein and its DNA allows screening of vast numbers of variants of the protein,<br>
	each linked to its corresponding DNA, by a simple in vitro selection procedure<br>
	called panning. In its simplest form, panning is carried out by incubating the<br>
20	pool of phage-displayed variants with the ligand of interest that has been im-<br>
	mobilized on a carrier, washing away unbound phage, and eluting specifically<br>
	bound phage by disrupting the binding to the ligand. The eluted phage is then<br>
	amplified in vivo. The process is repeated several times, resulting in stepwise<br>
	enrichment of the phage pool in favour of the tightest binding sequences. After<br>
25	about 3 to 6 rounds of selection and amplification, the best clones are se-<br>
	quenced and transformed into a host cell for further expression. The host cell<br>
	may be a eucaryotic or procaryotic cell e.g. a yeast, animal, plant or insect cell<br>
	or bacterial cell. It may even be a hybridoma cell, which after transformation<br>
	produces a recombinant monoclonal antibody. The recombinant binding part-<br>
30	ner or at least part of it may also be produced synthetically.<br>
		The concept to use recombinant antibody libraries makes the non-<br>
	competitive sandwich assay for small analytes feasible. The sandwich can be<br>
	detected by all the standard immunoassays. Usually one partner is immobil-<br>
	ized on a carrier, such as a microtiter well or a bead. A sandwich is formed in<br>
35	the presence of analyte and the other binding partner. The sandwich may be<br>
	detected e.g. by using secondary antibodies or by labelling at least one of the<br><br><br>
7<br>
	binding partners. The label can be any conventional label, such as a radioact-<br>
	ive label, an enzyme, or a fluorescent compound. The assay can be e.g.<br>
	ELISA or FIA.<br>
		A great advantage of the reagent pair of the present invention is<br>
5	that it enables a homogenous non-competitive immunoassay, i.e. an immun-<br>
	oassay that is carried out in solution. The avoidance of immobilising and wash-<br>
	ing steps makes the assay extremely simple. Such a test is also suitable for<br>
	testing on-site i.e. in places elsewhere than the laboratory.<br>
		A preferred homogenous immunoassay is one based on fluores-<br>
10	cence resonance energy transfer (FRET), for review see Szöllösi et al., 1998.<br>
	In FRET, energy from a molecular fluorophore (donor) is excited to a high-en-<br>
	ergy state and transferred to another fluorophore (acceptor) via intermolecular<br>
	dipole-dlpole coupling. This is possible only if the distance between the donor<br>
	and fhe acceptor is short (10-100 A) and the fluorescence spectrum of the<br>
15	donor and the absorption spectrum of the acceptor partially overlap. The en-<br>
	ergy transfer is then detected as a change in fluorescence. Often time-re-<br>
	solved fluorescence is utilized (Hemmilä et al., 1988).<br>
		FRET is applied to the present invention by labelling the two binding<br>
	partners, which preferably are antibody fragments, with fluorophores that form<br>
20	a FRET donor-acceptor pair. When the binding partners and the analyte are<br>
	small the fluorophores come into very close proximity, and a measurable<br>
	FRET signal is obtained.<br>
		The invention provides a convenient and rapid analytical tool for low<br>
	molecular weight analytes, such as therapeutic and abused drugs, steroids,<br>
25	hormones, metabolites, and environmental pollutants and toxins. A common<br>
	feature of these small analytes is that they are too small for conventional<br>
	sandwich assays where two antibodies recognizing different epitopes of the<br>
	antigen are used. The molecular weight of these small analytes are normally<br>
	less than 5000, but the limits are not absolute.<br>
30		The immunoassay may be employed in all kinds of investigations,<br>
	such as in detecting environmental hazards, toxic compounds in food and<br>
	feed, chemicals indicative of ongoing processes e.g. of microbial processes in<br>
	buildings, metabolic, processes of living organisms, and in clinical tests, drug<br>
	monitoring and pharmacological research. The assays are extremely suitable<br>
35	for detecting drugs of abuse, such as opiates (e.g. morphine), amphetamines,<br>
	cannabinoids (e.g. tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)), barbiturates, benzo-<br><br><br>
8<br>
	diazepines, cocaine, LSD, methadone, methaqualone, phencyclidine, pro-<br>
	poxyphene, tricyclic antidepressants. The homogenous assay provides an ex-<br>
	cellent and convenient tool for on-site tests e.g. to be used by the police in<br>
	raiding drivers etc. The sample to be analysed for e.g. drugs and abused<br>
5	drugs may be any body fluid sample, such as blood, serum, urine or saliva.<br>
		The reagent pair of the invention may be included in a test-kit. This<br>
	test-kit may further comprise any other reagents needed for the assay, such<br>
	as reaction solutions, buffers, washing solutions and detecting means, such as<br>
	labels and optionally a fluorometer. Preferably the test-kit comprises multiple<br>
10	reagent pairs physically separated from each other, e.g. many in the form of a<br>
	microarray, whereby e.g. many different drugs of abuse may be tested simul-<br>
	taneously from a single saliva sample.<br>
		In a special embodiment of the invention, a reagent pair for detect-<br>
	ing morphine is produced and employed in a homogenous immunoassay for<br>
15	said substance. The first binding partner is a Fab fragment obtained from a<br>
	phage display antibody library produced from cDNA from a mouse immunized<br>
	with morphine conjugated to an immunocarrier BSA. Morphine specific anti-<br>
	body phages were enriched by selecting those binding to morphine conjugated<br>
	BSA and sorting out those binding to BSA alone. After several panning rounds<br>
20	two high binding clones are sequenced and expressed. The expressed Fab<br>
	fragments were named M1 Fab and M2 Fab.<br>
		The second binding partner is obtained from a naive scFv antibody<br>
	fragment phage display library by selecting antibodies that bind to a complex<br>
	of morphine and M1 Fab. First the phages are preincubated to bound M1 Fab<br>
25	to sort out those binding to M1 Fab as such. The unbound phages are separ-<br>
	ated and incubated with a mixture of morphine and immobilised M1 Fab to se-<br>
	lect the phages that bind to the immunocomplex formed between the immobil-<br>
	ized M1 Fab and morphine. Unbound phages are washed away, and then<br>
	those bound to the complex are eluted. The background is monitored by<br>
30	checking the binding to M1 Fab in the absence of morphine. After several pan-<br>
	ning rounds a number of clones are picked up, sequenced and expressed res-<br>
	ulting in scFv fragment K11.<br>
		A fluorescence-based immunoassay is performed using M1 Fab la-<br>
	belled with europium as a first binding partner, and scFv fragment K11 labelled<br>
35	with Cy5 as a second binding partner. The binding partners are incubated with<br>
	saliva or urine samples containing morphine and then fluorescence is meas-<br><br><br>
9<br>
	ured after a predetermined time. The assay is completely homogeneous and<br>
	the signal is readable in about 5 min. The sensitivity for both urine and saliva<br>
	is clearly higher than that demanded by the authorities in the case of<br>
	morphine, our model analyte. The performance of the test is such that the re-<br>
5	agents are in the well of a microtiter plate and dilution series of either saliva or<br>
	urine is added. In a preferred mode for e.g. police field use, the reagents are<br>
	in dry form in a vessel. Saliva is added, which dissolves the reagents and the<br>
	result can be read without further processes.<br>
		The novel recombinant binding proteins provided by the invention<br>
10	comprise any ligand-binding portion of M1 Fab, M2 Fab or K11 scFv. By "lig-<br>
	and-binding portion" is meant that part of the molecule that is responsible for<br>
	the binding. Minor variations or modifications of the sequences set forth in the<br>
	description and claims are still within the scope of the invention provided that<br>
	they do not affect the binding activity of the proteins.<br>
15		The invention is illustrated by the following non-limiting example. It<br>
	should be understood, however, that the embodiments given in the description<br>
	above and in the examples are for illustrative purposes only, and that various<br>
	changes and modifications are possible within the scope of the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
20	Development of an anti-morphine antibody<br>
		immunisation of mice<br>
		Four six-week-old female Balb/c mice were immunised in three-<br>
	week intervals with morphine conjugated BSA (Fitzgerald) in Freund's ad-<br>
	juvant. Serum samples were tested after second booster and the mouse<br>
25	showing the best response against the antigen in direct ELISA was selected to<br>
	be the source of an antibody phage display library.<br>
		Construction of the antibody phage display library<br>
		All basic recombinant DNA methods were performed essentially as<br>
	described (Sambrook et al. 1990). The mouse with the highest antibody re-<br>
30	sponse to morphine-BSA conjugate was sacrificed and the total RNA was isol-<br>
	ated from the spleen cells using the RNagents Total RNA Isolation System<br>
	(Promega Co., Wl, USA). The mRNA pool of the total RNA was isolated with<br>
	the Oligotex mRNA Kit (OIAGEN Inc., Germany). The cDNA was synthesised<br>
	from the mRNA with oligo-dT priming. Genes encoding antibody Fab frag-<br>
35	ments were amplified with PCR using antibody kappa light chain and heavy<br><br><br>
10							10<br>
	chain variable region and constant region specific primers. Antibody light chain<br>
	PCR products were pooled and digested with Nhel and AscI restriction en-<br>
	zymes, purified by preparative agarose gel in combination with the QIAquick<br>
	Gel Extraction Kit (OlAGEN Inc.. Germany). The agarose gel purified antibody<br>
5	light chain DNA was ligated into the Fab phagemid vector phagemid9 derived<br>
	from pComb3 (Barbas et al., 1991) and transformed into the E.coli XL1-Blue<br>
	strain (Stratagene) by electroporation. Plasmid DNA was isolated with the OlA-<br>
	GEN Plasmid Midi Kit (Q1AGEN Inc., Germany) from the overnight culture.<br>
	PCR products encoding the Fd region (variable and first constant region) of<br>
10	the heavy chain were pooled and digested with Sfil and Notl restriction en-<br>
	zymes, purified by preparative agarose gel isolation and ligated to the<br>
	phagemid vector containing the light chain DNA. The phagemid vector encod-<br>
	ing both the heavy and light chain of the Fab fragment was transformed into<br>
	the E.coli TOP10F1 bacteria (Invitrogen Inc., CA, USA) by electroporation.<br>
15	Transformed bacteria were incubated over night at +37 C on a shaker and<br>
	plasmid DNA was isolated with the QIAGEN Plasmid Midi Kit. The diversity of<br>
	the antibody library was ensured by sequencing partial VL-or VH-gene regions<br>
	of individual clones.<br>
		A phage display antibody library was made as follows: 4 g of anti-<br>
20	body library plasmid DNA was transformed into E.coli TOP1 0F1 by electropora-<br>
	tion in two parallel transformations. After transformations, cells were suspen-<br>
	ded into 2,8 ml of SOC medium and incubated for 1 h at +35 C on a shaker. 7<br>
	ml Of prewarmed (+37 C) SB medium. 20 g/ml of carbenicillin, and 10 g/ml<br>
	of tetracycline was added. After 1 -h incubation at +35 C on a shaker, 30 g/ml<br>
25	of carbenicillin was added and the incubation was continued for 1 h after which<br>
	1 ml ( 1011 pfu) of helper phage VCS-M13 (Stratagene) was added and the<br>
	phages were let to infect the bacteria for 20 min at +35 C with a slow shaking.<br>
	The parallel transformations were joined together and 80 ml of prewarmed<br>
	(+37 C) SB medium with 50 g/ml carbenicillin and 10 g/ml of tetracycline<br>
30	was added. After 2-h incubation at +35 C on a shaker, 70 g/ml of kanamycin<br>
	was added and the incubation was continued over night.<br>
		Cells were centrifuged for 15 min at 4000g at +4 C. 20 ml of 20%<br>
	PEG, 2.5 M NaCl (PEG/NaCI) was added ID the supernatant and it was incub-<br>
	ated for 30 min on ice. PEG precipitated phages were centrifuged for 20 min<br>
35	at 13000g at +4 C. The pellet was suspended in 2 ml of PBS and 1 ml was<br>
	transferred into two eppendorf tubes. After centrifugation for 5 min at +4 C,<br><br><br>
11<br>
	phages were precipitated by adding 200 | of PEG/NaCl to the supernatant.<br>
	The solution was mixed and centrifuged for 5 min at +4 C. The pellet was sus-<br>
	pended in 1 ml of PBS orPBS+1% BSA. 1 | of 20% Na-azide was added as<br>
	a preservative. The phage display antibody library was stored at +4 C.<br>
5		Selection of the anti-morphine library<br>
		Morphine specific antibodies were selected from the phage display<br>
	antibody library by the following selection procedure: A microtiter well was<br>
	coated over night at +4 C with 1 g of morphine conjugated BSA (morphine-<br>
	BSA; Fitzgerald Industries International, Inc., MA, USA) in 100 | of 100 mM<br>
10	Na-bicarbonate buffer. pH 9.8. The well was washed two times with PBS and<br>
	blocked with 1 % BSA in PBS for 1 h at +37 C. 100 | of the phage library was<br>
	incubated in the well for 1 h at RT with shaking, after which the unbound<br>
	phages were removed and the well was washed 22 times with PBS. Bound<br>
	phages were eluted with 100 | of 100 mM HCI (pH 2.2) for 15 min. Eluted<br>
15	phages were removed from the well and neutralised with 1 M Tris. 3 ml of<br>
	fresh E.coli XL1-Blue cells (OD600 1) grown in SB supplemented with 10 g/ml<br>
	of tetracycline was infected with eluted phages at +35 C for 15 min. 7 ml of<br>
	prewarmed SB (+37 C) with 20 g/ml of carbenicillin and 10 g/ml of tetracyc-<br>
	line was added and the culture was incubated for 1 h at +35 C on a shaker. 30<br>
20	g/ml of carbenicillin was added and incubation was continued for 1 h. 1 ml of<br>
	helper phage VCS-M13 was added to the culture and incubated at +35 C for<br>
	15 min with a slow shaking. The culture was diluted with 90 ml of prewarmed<br>
	(+37 C) SB with 50 g/ml carbenicillin and 10 g/ml tetracycline. After 2 h in-<br>
	cubation at +35 C on a shaker, 70 g/ml of kanamycin was added and the in-<br>
25	cubation was continued over night. The purification of the amplified phages<br>
	was performed by PEG precipitation as described above.<br>
		The purified phages were used in further enrichment rounds. After<br>
	four selection rounds, morphine specific antibody phages had been enriched<br>
	over 1000 times when compared to the background. The background binding<br>
30	of the phages was monitored in parallel in each selection round by incubating<br>
	the phage library in a BSA coated microtiter well. The well was washed and<br>
	the phages were eluted as in the morphine-BSA coated well. The enrichment<br>
	of the morphine specific phages was monitored by comparing the amount of<br>
	the eluted phages from the morphine-BSA coated well to the amount of eluted<br>
35	phages from the background well.<br>
		Characterisation of individual clones<br><br>
12<br>
		After the fourth panning round, the phagemid DNA was isolated<br>
	with the QIAGEN Plasmid Midi Kit. The plasmid was digested with Nhel and<br>
	Notl restriction enzymes to isolate the Fab gene fragment. The agarose gel<br>
	isolated DNA was ligated to the expression vector pKKtac. The ligation reac-<br>
5	tion was transformed into the E.coli XL1-Blue cells.<br>
		Individual clones were picked and miniprep DNA was extracted with<br>
	the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Germany). According to sequen-<br>
	cing of the minipreps, two different Fab clones were found. These clones were<br>
	named M1 and M2. The amino acid sequences of the M1 Fab fragment were<br>
10	SEQ ID NO 1 (light chain) and SEQ ID NO 2 (heavy chain). Amino acids no. 3<br>
	to 108 represent the variable region and no. 109 to 215 the constant region of<br>
	the M1 light chain (SEQ ID NO 1). Amino acids no 4 to 123 represent the vari-<br>
	able region and no. 124 to 226 the constant region of the M1 heavy chain<br>
	(SEQ ID NO 2). The amino acid sequences of M2 Fab fragment were SEQ ID<br>
15	NO 3 (light chain) and SEQ ID NO 4 (heavy chain). Amino acids no 3 to 108<br>
	represent the variable region and no. 109 to 215 the constant region of the M2<br>
	light chain (SEQ ID NO 3). Amino acids no. 4 to 123 represent the variable re-<br>
	gion and no. 124 to 226 the constant region of the M2 heavy chain (SEQ ID<br>
	NO 4). The rest of the amino acids derive from the cloning technique, and<br>
20	some of the C-terminal amino acids facilitate the isolation and purification of<br>
	the protein. Small-scale (3 ml) Fab expression cultures were also made. Peri-<br>
	plasmic fraction of the cells was isolated by freezing and thawing the cells for<br>
	three times in PBS.<br>
		The binding of individual Fab clones to morphine was tested by<br>
25	ELISA in morphine-BSA coated microtiter wells: Microtiter wells were coated<br>
	with 200 ng of morphine-BSA in 0.1 M Na-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.8 for over<br>
	night at +4 C. Control wells were filled only with the buffer. After coating, wells<br>
	were washed three times with PBS and blocked with 0.5% BSA in PBS<br>
	(BSA/PBS) for 1 h at RT. Wells were washed three times with PBS and 1:10<br>
30	dilution of the periplasmic fractions was added into wells in 100 | of<br>
	BSA/PBS. After 1-h incubation at RT on a shaker, wells were washed three<br>
	times with PBS and 1:2000 diluted alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-<br>
	mouse Fab specific antibody (Sigma, A-1293) was added in 100 | of<br>
	BSA/PBS. The wells were incubated for 1 h at RT on a shaker and washed<br>
35	three times with PBS. 100 | of alkaline phosphatase substrate solution (2<br>
	mg/ml of p-nitrophenylphosphate di-Na-salt in diethanolamine-MgCI-buffer)<br><br><br>
13<br>
	was added to the wells and absorbance was measured. According to the pre-<br>
	liminary results, the M1 Fab showed better performance in the assay and was<br>
	therefore chosen for the continuation.<br>
		Fermentation and purification<br>
5		The anti-morphine Fab fragment M1 in the expression vector<br>
	pKKtac was transformed in the E.coli expression strain RV308. The Fab was<br>
	expressed by fed-batch fermentation in a Bio-Flow IV fermenter (New Brun-<br>
	swick) and purified by the Sepharose SP ion-exchange and protein G chroma-<br>
	tography (Pharmacia).<br>
10		Performance of the primary antibody in a competitive immunoassay<br>
		The performance of the M1 anti-morphine Fab fragment was tested<br>
	in a competitive ELISA assay using the commercial urine toxicology controls<br>
	S1 and S3 (Bio-Rad). The S1 urine toxicology control contains drugs and drug<br>
	metabolites (including morphine) at concentrations 20-25% below immunoas-<br>
15	say cut-off levels as recommended by the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental<br>
	Health Services Administration (SAMSHA) and other agencies. The S3 urine<br>
	toxicology control contains drugs and drug metabolites at concentrations ap-<br>
	proximately three times immunoassay cut-off levels. Microtiter wells were<br>
	coated over night at +4 C with 500 ng of morphine-BSA in 100 | of Na-bicar-<br>
20	bonate buffer, pH 9.8. Wells were washed three times with PBS and blocked<br>
	with BSA/PBS for 1 h at RT. After three washes with PBS, S1, S3 (Bio-Rad),<br>
	positive control, or negative control urine dilutions were added to the wells in<br>
	100 | of BSA/PBS spiked with 1 ng of M1 Fab. Wells were incubated for 2 h<br>
	at RT on a shaker and washed three times with PBS. 1:2000 diluted alkaline<br>
25	phosphatase conjugated anti-Fab antibody (Sigma, A-1293) was added to the<br>
	wells in 100 | of BSA/PBS and incubated for 1 h at RT on a shaker. Wells<br>
	were washed three times with PBS, 100 | of alkaline phosphatase substrate<br>
	solution was added and A405 was measured. Results are shown in Figure 1. A<br>
	positive result could be achieved with 1:64 dilution of the sample.<br>
30	Development of an anti-immune complex antibody specific to the im-<br>
	mune complex of M1 Fab and morphine<br>
		Selection of the immune complex specific antibody from a naive hu-<br>
	man scFv phaae display library<br>
		M1 Fab fragment was biotinylated with ImmunoPure Sulfo-NHS-LC-<br>
35	Biotin Kit (Pierce). Biotinylated antibody was purified and buffer was changed<br>
	to PBS with Econo-Pac 10DG Columns (Bio-Rad, CA, USA). 200 | of a naïve<br><br><br>
14<br>
	human scFv phage display library (Kappa or Lambda light chain) in BSA/PBS<br>
	was preincubated with 10 | of streptavidin coated magnetic beads (Dynal, M-<br>
	280) and 0.5 g of biotinylated M1 Fab for over night at +4 C. The naive hu-<br>
	man scFv phage display library was constructed from pooled lymphocytes of<br>
5	50 healthy individuals. The size of the library was estimated to be 1x108<br>
	clones. The naive human scFv phage display library contains the IgM specific<br>
	VH-genes combined either with the kappa or lambda specific VL-genes. Un-<br>
	bound phages were separated from the beads and 100 | of them was incub-<br>
	ated with 100 ng of morphine, 500 ng of biotinylated M1 Fab, and 5 | of strep-<br>
10	tavidin coated magnetic beads for 1 h at RT on a shaker. The background for<br>
	the selection procedure was implemented in a similar way but omitting the<br>
	morphine from the binding reaction. Magnetic beads were washed five times<br>
	with 0.5 ml of PBS and bound phages were eluted with 100 | of HCI (pH 2.2)<br>
	for 30 min. The eluted phages were neutralised with 1M Tris and E.coli XL1-<br>
15	Blue cells were infected. Ceils were grown and phages were purified as de-<br>
	scribed previously. After five panning rounds enrichment was seen with the<br>
	scFv library having the kappa light chains, when the amount of eluted phages<br>
	was compared to the amount of eluted phages from the background control<br>
	well. The enrichment of specific binders to the immune complex, formed by<br>
20	M1 Fab and morphine, was also clearly seen in a phage ELISA when the<br>
	eluted phage pools from the selection rounds were tested.<br>
		Characterisation of individual clones<br>
		Individual phage clones were picked and they were sequenced. All<br>
	of the clones had the same sequence (SEQ ID NO 5). The amino acid se-<br>
25	quence of anti-M1+morphine immune complex scFv fragment was named K11<br>
	scFv. Amino acids no- 3 to 120 represent the heavy chain variable region, no.<br>
	140 to 246 represent the light chain variable region, and no. 121 to 139 repre-<br>
	sent the linker of K11 scFv (SEQ ID NO 5). The rest of the amino acids derive<br>
	from the cloning technique, and some of the C-terminal amino acids facilitate<br>
30	the isolation and purification of the protein.<br>
		Expression and purification<br>
		The gene encoding the scFv fragment K 11 was inserted into the<br>
	expression vector pKKtac and transformed into the E.coli RV308 strain. Cells<br>
	were inoculated into 20 ml of LB with 100 g/ml ampicillin and were incubated<br>
35	over night at +37 C on a shaker. From the overnight culture a 10 ml inoculate<br>
	was added into two erlenmeyer bottles containing 500 ml of LB with 100 g/ml<br><br><br>
15							15<br>
	of ampicillin. Cells were incubated at +37 C on a shaker until the OD600 was 1<br>
	after which 0.5 ml of 1M IPTG and 100 g/ml of ampicillin were added into the<br>
	culture and the incubation was continued over night at +30 C on a shaker.<br>
	Both the supernatant of the culture medium and the periplasmic fraction of the<br>
5	cells were used for the purification of the K11 scFv. Cells were centrifuged at<br>
	4000g for 15 min and the supernatant was poured into a clean flask. The cells<br>
	were resuspended in 20 ml of PBS. The periplasmic fraction of the cells was<br>
	isolated by freezing (-70 C) and thawing (+37 C) the cells for three times. After<br>
	centrifugation at 12000g for 30 min, the clear periplasmic supernatant was<br>
10	taken. The culture medium and the periplasmic fraction were treated with 2<br>
	mg/ml of DNasel to remove residual chromosomal DNA for two hours at<br>
	+37 C. Since the expressed K11 scFv has a 6xHis-tag in its C-terminus, it<br>
	could be purified by immobilised metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). The<br>
	K11 scFv was purified by expanded bed chromatography using STREAMLINE<br>
15	Chelating (Amershampharmacia biotech) as a matrix and copper as the metal<br>
	chelate. The purity of K11 scFv was checked with SDS-PAGE.<br>
	Development of a non-competitive immunoassay for morphine<br>
		Labelling of the anti-immune complex antibody K11 scFv with<br>
	europium<br>
20		The purified anti-M1 and morphine immune complex scFv fragment<br>
	K11 was labelled with europium chelate by the DELFIA Eu-Labelling Kit (Wal-<br>
	lac) as described by the manufacturer. Buffer of the labelled K11 scFv was<br>
	changed to 50 mM Tris pH 7.8, 0.9% NaCI. Labelling yield was 0.4 Eu/scFv,<br>
		A non-competitive immunoassay for morphine<br>
25		The sensitivity and cross-reactivity of K11 scFv was studied by a<br>
	non-competitive immunoassay. Transparent Streptawell (Roche) streptavidin<br>
	coated microtiter wells were washed three times with PBS. 500 ng of biot-<br>
	inylated anti-morphine M1 Fab was added into the wells in 100 | of BSA/PBS<br>
	and the wells were incubated for 30 min at RT on a shaker. After three PBS<br>
30	washes, sample dilutions spiked with morphine, amphetamine, tetrahydrocan-<br>
	nabinol (THC) or S1 urine control were added into the wells in 50 | of<br>
	BSA/PBS. 1:100 diluted europium labelled K11 scFv was added into the wells<br>
	in 50 | of BSA/PBS and the incubation was continued for 1 h. Wells were<br>
	washed three times with PBS and 100 | of Enhancement solution (Wallac)<br>
35	was added into the wells. After 15-min shaking at RT, fluorescence was detec-<br>
	ted by VictorV fluorometer (Wallac). Results are shown in Figure 2. There is a<br><br><br>
16<br>
	significant difference in affinity between the binding of K11 scFv to the primary<br>
	antibody fragment M1 and to the M1 and morphine immune complex. This al-<br>
	lows the detection of 1 ng/ml of morphine in a sample. No cross-reactivity with<br>
	amphetamine or THC was detected.<br>
5		A homogenous time resolved fluorescent resonance energy transfer<br>
	(TR-FRET)<br>
		The anti-morphine Fab fragment M1 was labelled with europium by<br>
	the LANCE Eu-W1024 ITC chelate Kit (Wattac). The buffer of me labelled M1<br>
	was changed to 50 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 0.9% NaCl. The labelling yield was 1.1<br>
10	Eu/Fab. The anti-M1 +morphine immune complex scFv fragment K11 scFv was<br>
	labelled with Cy5 by the FluoroLink-Ab Cy5 labelling kit (Amershampharmacia<br>
	biotech). The labelling yield was 2 Cy5/scFv.<br>
		Saliva was spiked with various dilutions of morphine and these<br>
	samples were filtered through cotton wool before adding into the black mi-<br>
15	crotiter wells (Nunc). 1 g of europium labelled M1 Fab and 1 g of Cy5 la-<br>
	belled K11 scFv was added into the wells in 50 | of BSA/PBS. TR-FRET was<br>
	read after 5, 15, 30, or 60 min incubation at RT by VictorV fluorometer (Wal-<br>
	lac). Results are shown in Figure 3. After five minutes incubation. 1 ng/ml of<br>
	morphine in saliva was detected.<br>
20		While one strategy for providing reagents and assays of the inven-<br>
	tion has been described, numerous variations and modifications will become<br>
	apparent to the person skilled in the art.<br>
	Example 2<br>
	Cross-reactivity of the M1 Fab-fragment with codeine, heroin, noscapine<br>
25	and papaverine<br>
		Cross-reactivity of M1 anti-morphine Fab-fragment with codeine.<br>
	heroin, noscapine and papaverine was tested in a competitive ELISA. Mi-<br>
	crotiter plate wells were coated o/n at +4°C with 500 ng of morphine-BSA in<br>
	100 | of Na-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.8. The wells were washed three times<br>
30	with PBS and blocked with 0.5% BSA/PBS for 1 h at RT and washed again<br>
	three times with PBS. Two parallel 100 | samples containing morphine,<br>
	codeine, heroin, noscapine or papaverine (39, 78. 156, 313, 625, 1250, 2500<br>
	or 5000 ng/ml) In PBS with 5 ng of purified M1 Fab were added into the wells<br>
	and incubated for 30 min at RT on a shaker and washed three times with PBS.<br>
35	1:2000 diluted alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-Fab antibody (Sigma, A-<br><br><br>
17<br>
	1293) was added to the wells in 100 | of 0.5% BSA/PBS and incubated for 30<br>
	min at RT on a shaker. Wells were washed three limes with PBS, 100 | of al-<br>
	kaline phosphatase substrate solution was added and A405 was measured. The<br>
	results are shown in Figure 4. According to the competitive ELISA result M1<br>
5	antibody has high cross-reactivity to codeine and heroin, which are structurally<br>
	very similar with morphine,<br>
	A homogenous time resolved fluorescent resonance energy transfer (TR-<br>
	FRET) imunoassay for morphine<br>
		The anti-morphine Fab fragment M1 was labelled with europium by<br>
10	LANCE Eu-W1024 ITC chelate Kit (Wallac). The buffer of the labelled M1 was<br>
	changed to 50 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 0.9% NaCI. The labelling yield was 1.1<br>
	Eu/Fab. The anti-M1+morphine immune complex scFv fragment K11 was la-<br>
	belled with Cy5 by FluoroLink-Ab Cy5 labelling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Bi-<br>
	otech), The labelling yield was 2 Cy5/scFv.<br>
15		Saliva was spiked with a high concentration (10 µg/ml) of the follow-<br>
	ing drugs: morphine, heroin, codeine, papaverine and noscapine. The samples<br>
	were filtered through cotton wool before adding into black microtiter wells<br>
	(Nunc). 1 g of europium labelled M1 Fab and 1 g of Cy5 labelled K11 scFv<br>
	was added into the wells in 50 | of BSA/PBS. As the control the background<br>
20	fluorescence from the M1 and K11 antibody pair without any added drug was<br>
	measured. TR-FRET was read after 5 min incubation at RT by VictorV fluoro-<br>
	meter (Wallac). The results are shown in Figure 5.<br>
		Saliva sample spiked with morphine is giving a high fluorescent<br>
	value, whereas the other drugs are giving fluorescent values that are similar to<br>
25	the background fluorescence detected from the control (labelled M1 and K11<br>
	scFv fragments without any added drug). K11 scFv binds the immune complex<br>
	formed between M1 and mophine with extremely high specificity. K11 is able<br>
	to discriminate completely M1 and morphine immune complex from the im-<br>
	mune complexes between M1 and heroin or M1 and codeine, which gave<br>
30	fluorescent values corresponding to the background level.<br><br><br>
