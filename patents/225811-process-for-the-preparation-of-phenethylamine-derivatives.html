Process for the preparation of phenethylamine derivatives<br>
The present invention is directed to a process for the preparation of phenethylamine derivatives by hydrogenation of phenylacetonitriles in presence of a nickel or cobalt catalyst.<br>
The compounds of formula (1) are known for being particularly useful as synthesis intermediates for preparing pharmaceutical active substances which are central nervous system antidepressants. An important substance is Venlafaxine (see Merck Index Twelfth Edition 1996, No. 10079). The preparation of this compound is described in US-A-4,535,186.<br>
According to US-A-4,535,186, Example 2. intermediates of formula (1) are prepared by hydrogenation in the presence of a rhodium catalyst. The use of rhodium catalysts provides economical drawbacks and therefore such catalysts would have to be recycled, resulting in a further process step and the possibility of varying catalytic effect of the recycled catalyst.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a process for the preparation of phenethylamine derivatives in high yields which meets economical demands.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a compound of formula<br><br>
or salts thereof, wherein<br>
Ri is hydrogen, hydroxyl, or unsubstituted or substituted alkyl or alkoxy,<br>
R2 is hydrogen or a substituent which can be converted to hydrogen, and<br>
n is 0, 1 or 2,<br>
comprising hydrogenating a compound of formula<br><br><br>
wherein Ri, R2 and n are as defined above, in the presence of a nickel or cobalt catalyst.<br>
Ri as alkyl can be a straight-chain or branched alkyl substituent, preferably Ci-C4alkyl. such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl. isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-but/l, tert-butyl. The substituents mentioned can be unsubstituted or substituted. An example for such substituents is phenyl.<br>
Ri as alkoxy can be a straight-chain or branched alkoxy substituent, preferably CrC4alkoxy, such as methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, isopropoxy, n-butoxy, sec-butoxy, tert-butoxy. Methoxy is preferred. The substituents mentioned can be unsubstituted or substituted. An example for such substituents is phenyl.<br>
Preferably, Ri is hydroxyl or Ci-C4alkoxy, especially Cv-C4alkoxy. Methoxy is highly preferred. It is preferred that Ri is bonded to the benzene ring in para-position.<br>
Examples for substituents R2 which can be converted to hydrogen are silyl, benzyl, formyl or C2-C6alkanoyl. The conversion can be carried out according to known methods.<br>
â– 	Preferably, R2 is hydrogen, formyl or C2-C6alkanoyl, especially hydrogen.<br>
For n the number 1 is preferred.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention R, is methoxy, R2 is hydrogen and n is 1.<br>
According to the present invention nickel or cobalt catalysts well known and used in the hydrogenation field can be used.<br>
For example, a nickel catalyst can be made by thermally decomposing nickel formate or other heat-labile nickel salts, for example in fatty oil, or by precipitating a nickel salt on an<br><br>
inert carrier followed by a reduction with hydrazine or hydrogen gas. A nickel catalyst also can be prepared by the treatment of electrolytically precipitated nickel hydroxide which may be prepared by passing direct current through a cell using nickel as the anode and using the dilute solution of an alkali salt to the weak acid as an electrolyte. The nickel hydroxide so prepared may be conventionally reduced, such as, in the presence of hydrogen gas or hydrazine.<br>
The nickel or cobalt catalyst also may be promoted as is conventional in this field. So, the catalysts may contain, for example, Group VIB metals, Group VIB metal compounds which are reducible by hydrogen to the corresponding elemental metal, or manganese or iron promoters. Specific examples of the group VIB metals or hydrogen-reducible metal compounds include elemental chromium, chromium acetate, chromium chloride, chromium oxide, elemental molybdenum, molybdenum hydroxide, molybdenum oxide, elemental tungsten, tungsten chloride, tungsten oxide, and the like, and mixtures of any two or more thereof. The weight ratio of the group VIB component to the metal component of the nickel or cobalt catalyst can be any suitable value, but will generally be in the range from about 0.001:1 to about 0.2:1 and preferably in the range from about 0.005:1 to about 0.1:1.<br>
The catalysts can be in supported or unsupported form. Typical support materials include, for example, carbon, aluminium oxide, silicium dioxide, Cr203, titanium dioxide, zirconium dioxide, zinc oxide, calcium oxide, magnesium oxide, barium sulfate, calcium carbonate or aluminium phosphate. The nickel or cobalt catalyst can be bound on the substrate in an amount of, for example, about 1.0 - 20.0 % by weight.<br>
The preferred catalysts are Raney nickel and Raney cobalt catalysts. Such catalysts are, for example, formed by mixing nickel and aluminum or cobalt and aluminum and subsequently treating the respective mixtures with a suitable base, such as sodium hydroxide to remove the aluminum, thus leaving a highly reactive nickel or cobalt metal catalyst.<br>
in all cases nickel catalysts are preferred; highly preferred are Raney nickel catalysts.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention the nickel or cobalt catalysts are pretreated with a carboxylic acid or a salt or an anhydride thereof or an ammonium salt.<br><br>
or a vanadium-, a tungsten-, or a molybdenum compound. Mixtures of at least two of these compounds can also be used.<br>
Carboxylic acids, including polycarboxylic acids, having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, especially 2 to 8 carbon atoms, are preferred. The carboxylic acids can be unsubstituted or substituted by, for example, hydroxy or halogen (like fluorine). Examples of such carboxylic acids are formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butanoic acid, pentanoic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, malic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, trifluoracetic acid. Examples for anhydrides are acetic anhydride, propionic anhydride and further anhydrides of the carboxylic acids mentioned above. Examples for salts of the carboxylic acids are the corresponding alkali metal salts, like sodium salts.<br>
Preferred are carboxylic acids having from 2 to 4 carbon atoms, especially 2 carbon atoms. These carboxylic acids can be unsubstituted or substituted as given above. This definition should also include the salts and anhydrides thereof. Highly preferred is acetic acid (as well as the salts and the anhydride thereof).<br>
Ammonium salts are, for example, ammonium halides, like ammonium chloride or especially ammonium fluoride<br>
Preferred vanadium compounds are those in which vanadium has the oxidation state 0, 2, 3, 4 or 5. Elemental vanadium is also suited. Examples of such compounds are V2O5, VOCI3, V204,NH4 VO3. Specially prefered are acetyl acetonate (acac) containing compounds, examples of such compounds are V(acac)3, V0(acac)2. The vanadium compounds are used in catalytic amounts, solved or dispersed.<br>
Preferred tungsten or molybdenum compounds are compounds in which the metal has the oxidation state 0. 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. Examples are H2WO4, H3[P(W30io)4]; H2M0O4,<br>
H3[P(M030io)4].<br>
For the pretreatment of the nickel or cobalt catalysts the use of carboxylic acids or salts or anhydrides thereof, or acetyl acetonate containing compounds is preferred. Highly preferred are carboxylic acids.<br><br>
Advantageously the pretreatment is carried out in an aqueous medium. As a rule the aqueous medium contains the nickel or cobalt catalyst and the agent used for the treatment. Usually the treatment is carried out at ambient temperature, although also lower or higher temperatures can be used.<br>
The reaction conditions of the hydrogenation, like time, temperature and pressure, are to a large extent interchangeable, as will be recognized by the skilled practitioner.<br>
Preferably, the hydrogenation is carried out in an organic solvent, like an alcohol (for example methanol or especially ethanol). Furthermore, it is preferred that the hydrogenation is carried out in presence of a base (examples are NH3, NH4OH and NaOH).<br>
The cited catalysts can be present in the reaction mixture in an amount of about 0.1 to 500% by weight, preferably of 20 to 200% by weight, based on the amount of educt used.<br>
The educts can be present in the reaction mixture in an amount of about 0.1 to 80% by weight, preferably of 5 to 20% by weight, based on the weight of the reaction mixture.<br>
The temperature to be used for the reaction can be, for example, 0 to 200Â°C, a temperature of 20 to 120Â°C being preferred. Highly preferred is a temperature of 20 to 80Â°C.<br>
The reaction time can vary, for example, from 0.1 to 24 hours. Usually the reaction time is from 0.1 to 14 hours, especially from 0.1 to 4 hours.<br>
The hydrogen pressure is, for example, 1 to 200 bar, especially 1 to 100 bar. A hydrogen pressure of 20 to 60 bar is preferred.<br>
The catalyst can be re-used 1 to 100 times, especially 1 to 10 times; surprisingly, it is possible to re-use the catalyst without further treatment and the recycled catalyst shows no decrease in activity or selectivity.<br>
After the reaction the product can be further purified according to known methods. For example, the product obtained after the reaction can be dissolved in an organic solvent (like diisopropyl ether) and separated by addition of an acid and filtration of the corresponding<br><br>
salt. Preferably, the product can be purified by addition of a hydrogen halide (like hydrogen chloride) or a carboxylic acid having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms (tike formic acid). Highly preferred is the addition of formic acid after which the compound is separated by filtration as the compound of formula (1a)<br><br>
A further object of the present invention are compounds of formula (1a). As to these compounds the meanings and preferences given above apply. The compounds of formula (la) do not require special treatment when they are further converted into compounds of formula (3).<br>
Alternatively, the product can be used directly, without purification, for further reactions like those described below.<br>
Another object of the present invention is a process for the preparation of a compound of formula<br><br>
wherein<br>
Ri, R2 and n are as defined above,<br>

and converting the compound of formula (1) to the compound of formula (3).<br>
As to Ri, R2 and n the above meanings and preferences apply.<br>
The conversion of the compound of formula (1) to the compound of formula (3) can be carried out according to known processes. Such a conversion and the reaction conditions to be used are described in US-A-4,535,186 (see especially Example 3).<br><br>

Step A) can, for example, be carried out by reaction of the compound of formula (1) with formaldehyde, formic acid in a large excess of water. Step B) can be carried out in<br><br>
conventional manner by forming the acid addition salt, whereby preferably an equimolar amount of hydrochloric is used.<br>
