				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>[0001] The invention relates to a guide mechanism in evacuatable web treatmemt<br>
installations for the guidance of webs as hereunder described.<br>
[0002] Through the paper "Engineering Solutions Enabling a New Family of Expandable,<br>
Multi-Process, Multi-Chamber Vacuum Roll Coaters", published 1999, Society of Vacuum<br>
Coaters, 42nd Annual Technical Conference Proceedings (1999) ISSN 0737-5921, pp. 475<br>
to 479, it has become known to connect in series a large number of modular chambers<br>
and lock valves in order to be able to carry out sequentially any desired coating and<br>
treatment processes of webs. However, this presupposes the highly precise orientation<br>
of the module chambers, in order to make possible the trouble-free transport of the<br>
webs through all chambers and their connection slots.<br>
[0003] The installation is one that is combined or can be combined out of chamber<br>
modules, for which no possibilities for the relative orientation of the chambers with<br>
respect to one another and no internal means for the correction of the web running path<br>
are specified.<br>
[0004] DE 197 35 603 C1 discloses disposing in the individual module chambers,<br>
separated by web valves, roller frames with guide and coating rollers, such that the web<br>
traversal can be adapted through the registration or torsion of the roller frames relative<br>
to one another. Since hereby the coating rollers, denoted as cooling rollers, are also<br>
rotated, it is required to adapt by adjustment the coating sources, so-called magnetron<br>
sputter sources, to the spatial position of the coating rollers. Such setting or registration<br>
is cumbersome, time consuming and complicated and assumes a vast number of<br>
adjusting mechanisms and manual setting processes. Not disclosed are especially<br>
solutions to the problem, that through the adjustment of the coating rollers the gap<br>
widths between their surfaces and stationary chamber partitioning walls, which<br>
encompass the coating rollers, are also changed.<br>
[0005] US 4 485 125 discloses affecting near the end of an arcuate running path of<br>
travel of a web through a long series of vacuum chambers, disposed in the form of an<br>
arc, the remaining path thereby that before the winding-up the web is allowed to run<br>
over a single roller whose one bearing can be adjusted eccentrically such that a<br>
telescopic winding on the take-up winding roller is avoided. While it is possible to adjust<br>
under remote operation the direction of the eccentricity through a light barrier, not,<br>
however, the degree of the eccentricity. Direction of adjustment and eccentricity are<br>
therewith coupled necessarily, and this can have a negative effect. The eccentricity must<br>
be kept low, for example a few thousandths of an inch, in order for the web not be abut<br>
the slot edges which are disposed in front and above said roller. The installation is one<br>
combined or that can be combined out of chamber modules for which no possibilities for<br>
the relative orientation of the chambers with respect to one another are specified.<br>
[0006] EP 0 733 736 A2 discloses in the case of a non-vacuum installation, for example<br>
in paper production by means of a continuous running belt, such as a screen belt or<br>
conveyor belt, to adjust the angular position of at least one of the plurality of rollers<br>
forming a roller array through its one bearing block directed movably on rollers, relative<br>
to the running direction of the belt. Such continuous belts form a loop which is inherent<br>
to the installation and is not wound up, but rather serves for the underpropping and for<br>
the transport of the finite paper web or the product to be treated. The problem of<br>
telescopic winding of the paper web is not addressed; rather, the issue involves only<br>
avoiding the lateral migration of the continuous belt on the roller array. The device does<br>
not pertain to the species.<br>
[0007] In its introduction US 2001/0040097 Al clearly expresses a position in contrast<br>
to the above cited US 4 485 125. Disclosed is an apparatus operated for the galvanic<br>
coating with liquid baths and water. Vacuum processes are conventionally operated in a<br>
vacuum of less than 1 mbar, for example up to 10-2 mbar and below. In such a vacuum<br>
an aqueous fluid would evaporate to a large extent. Transfer of the known solution to<br>
vacuum processes is thus neither disclosed nor made obvious.<br>
[0008] The invention therefore has as its aim to specify a guide mechanism of the above<br>
described species, in which the absolutely linear orientation of the individual chamber<br>
modules becomes superfluous, and in which the web guidance can be set and fixed in<br>
position independently of possibly not exactly linear spatial positions of the coating<br>
rollers and of the treatment and coating sources and chamber modules.<br>
[0009] The solution of the posed aim is achieved according to the invention through the<br>
distinguishing features of the invention described hereunder.<br>
[0010] The invention avoids the disadvantages of prior art, in particular a guide<br>
arrangement of the above described species is specified, in which the absolutely linear<br>
orientation of the individual chamber modules becomes superfluous, and in which the<br>
web guidance can be set and fixed in position independently of possibly not exactly<br>
linear spatial positions of the coating roller and/or of the treatment and coating sources<br>
and chamber modules and can be carried out without great constructional and<br>
operational effort.<br>
[0011] The invention therefore has as its aim to specify a guide arrangement of the<br>
above described species, in which an absolutely linear orientation of the individual<br>
chamber modules becomes unnecessary, and in which the web guidance can be set and<br>
fixed in position independently of the spatial positions of the coating roller and of the<br>
treatment and coating sources and chambers.<br>
[0012] The defined aim is attained according to the invention thereby that the guide roller<br>
is supported between two pivot bearings, of which at least one is adjustable relative to the<br>
other transversely to the axis.<br>
[0013] The invention avoids the disadvantages of prior art. In particular a guide<br>
arrangement of the above described species is specified, in which the absolutely linear<br>
orientation of the individual chamber modules becomes superfluous, and in which the<br>
web guidance can be carried out settably and fixably independently of the spatial<br>
positions of the coating roller and/or the treatment and coating sources and chambers<br>
without great constructional and operational effort.<br>

[0034] * the guide arrangement with at least one guide roller, which comprises an<br>
axis and is supported between two pivot bearings, of which at least one is disposed such<br>

of the running direction of webs in at least one chamber of an evacuatable web treatment<br>
installation combined out of individual chamber modules not oriented exactly with<br>
respect to one another.<br>
[0035] In the following embodiment examples of the subject of the invention and their<br>
operational mechanisms will be explained in further detail in conjunction with Figures 1<br>
to 3.<br>
[0036] In the drawing depict:<br>
[0037] Figure 1 a partially sectioned view of a guide arrangement with radial<br>
viewing direction onto the axis of the guide roller,<br>
[0038] Figure 2 a radial section through a guide roller with a web guided thereover,<br>
and<br>
[0039] Figure 3 a perspective view of two chamber modules in series one with the<br>
other of treatment or coating installations.<br>
[0040] Figure 1 depicts a guide arrangement 1 with a guide roller 2, of which, however,<br>
only the two ends with their journal pins 3 and 4 are shown and which comprises an axis<br>
5, a shell 6 concentric with it and two end pieces 7. The interior space 8 communicates<br>
via venting and aerating bores 9 with the environs, i.e. the chamber volume.<br>
[0041] The guide roller 2 serves for the guidance of webs 10 (see Figure 2) in<br>
evacuatable web treatment installations according to Figure 3. The spatial position of the<br>
axis 5 can be adjusted thereby that the guide roller 2 is supported between two pivot<br>
bearings 11 and 12, of which the right one is adjustable relative to the left one<br>
transversely to axis 5. The adjustable pivot bearing 12 is fastened by means of a holding<br>
fixture 13 on a chamber wall 14 and adjustable parallel to it.<br>
[0042] This is carried out thereby that the adjustable pivot bearing 12 comprises a slide<br>
guide 15 fastened on the chamber wall 14, on which slide guide a slide 16 with the pivot<br>
bearing 12 is guided. This is pivotably mounted on slide 16 via a bearing housing 17 by<br>
means of a swivel bearing 18.<br>
[0043] According to Figure 2 the adjustment direction (double arrow) of the slide guide<br>
15 lies in the bisecting line of the arc of contact of, for example, 90 degrees of the guide<br>
roller 2 by the web 10. Hereby through a minimum adjustment range a maximum change<br>
of the web running direction transversely to web 10 can be attained, such that the latter,<br>
without contact with the edge of a slot 19 in a partitioning wall 20, can be guided between<br>
two chamber volumes and be taken over by the web guide in the succeeding chamber<br>
volume. However, in principle an adjustment into any spatial positions is possible. An<br>
adjustment can also be omitted if the web running path already meets the specifications.<br>
A person skilled in the art can choose between maximum adjustment effect and<br>
maximum adjustment precision by deviating from the bisecting line of the arc.<br>
[0044] The adjustable pivot bearing 12 comprises a remotely operated adjustment drive<br>
21 comprised of an electromotor 22, a step-down gear 23 and a rotation coupling 24 and<br>
placed in a supporting housing 25, which can be vented and aerated. The rotation<br>
coupling 24 includes an elastic intermediate member which is not provided with a<br>
reference number. The electromotor 22, the step-down gear 23 and the rotation coupling<br>
24 have axes aligned with one another, which are oriented parallel to the displacement<br>
direction of the slide guide 15. The portion of the slide guide 15, not covered by slide 16,<br>
is covered by at least one bellows 26. The slide guide 15 comprises one stop 15a and 15b<br>
at each end.<br>
[0045] The orientation of the guide roller 2 or the traversing web 10, respectively, can be<br>
automated thereby that the position of the edge of the web 10 is detected via an (not<br>
shown) optical sensor, which, via a control element, for example the adjustment drive 21,<br>
orients the guide roller 2 accordingly. It is also feasible to employ several optical sensors<br>
on a line perpendicular to the web edge, through which the instantaneous position of the<br>
web 10 is acquired.<br>
[0046] The left pivot bearing 11, which is not adjustable transversely to axis 5, is<br>
fastened on the other end of guide roller 2 swivellably on a stationary holding fixture 27,<br>
and specifically via a bearing housing 28 and a further swivel bearing 29. The disposition<br>
is herein such that the holding fixture 27 of the nonadjustable pivot bearing 11 has axial<br>
tolerance for the compensation of angle and length changes of the guide roller 2. A<br>
suspension 27a can be comprised of a chamber wall or by a mounting lug suspended on<br>
the chamber ceiling. In the latter case, also shown in Figure 3, the suspension terminates<br>
at the dot-dash delimiter line 27b.<br>
[0047] Figure 3 shows a perspective view of two chamber modules 30 and 31 in series<br>
one with the other of treatment or coating installations, which are comprised of the series<br>
disposition of evacuatable chambers 32, 33, 34 and 35, in which the adjustable guide<br>
rollers 2 are each disposed in front of a passage opening in the form of a slot 19 to the<br>
succeeding chamber, as is indicated in Figure 2.<br>
[0048] Chamber 32 is an inward transport lock chamber with a rotatable arbor 32a for an<br>
(not shown here) untreated web roll and a closure flap 32b. The chamber modules 30 and<br>
31 are structured similarly. Their chambers 33 and 34 are also evacuatable and each has<br>
in its center a cooled coating roller 36 on the circumference of which four radial<br>
partitioning walls are disposed, which are here not provided with reference numbers and<br>
whose inner ends, with the exception of a narrow gap, extend up to the particular<br>
emplaced web 10.<br>
[0049] Above the two uppermost partitioning walls is located a common subchamber for<br>
all guide and deflection rollers, beneath said partitioning walls are located three sector-<br>
shaped subchambers for sliding in, not shown, treatment and/or coating sources, which<br>
are fastened on a closure plate which is also not shown here and which can be moved<br>
away. All subchambers are connected to their own vacuum pumps 37.<br>
[0050] Chamber 35 is an outward transport lock chamber with a rotatable arbor 35a for a<br>
treated web roll, not shown here, and a closure flap 35b. The front closure walls of the<br>
chambers 32 and 35 are also omitted to permit inspecting the inside.<br>
[0051] The guide rollers 2 are not driven, but are "dragged" by the particular emplaced<br>
web. They also do not need to have a cylindrical surface, but can also be implemented as<br>
expander rollers in banana form or with conical roller segments, whose shell lines<br>
traverse a common, aligned and linear take-off. The number of chamber modules 30 and<br>
31 is nearly arbitrary.<br>
[0052] In contrast to, for example, DE 197 35 603 Cl, neither the coating roller nor the<br>
treatment and coating sources nor the partitioning walls between the subchambers need to<br>
be repositioned with a registration of the guide roller to follow its movement.<br>
