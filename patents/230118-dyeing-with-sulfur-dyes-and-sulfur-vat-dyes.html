				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for dyeing fiber materials with sulfur<br>
dyes and sulfur vat dyes.<br>
The group of sulfur dyes and sulfur vat dyes (hereinafter referred to as just<br>
sulfur dyes) groups dyes of the same method of manufacture and the same<br>
method of dyeing together. Sulfur dyes are produced by reaction of suitable<br>
organic substances with sulfur, alkali metal sulfides or alkali metal polysulfides.<br>
The products formed contain recurring organic structural elements which are<br>
joined together by disulfide groups. The chemical constitution is in most cases<br>
not certain. For dyeing, sulfur dyes are reduced by various methods which<br>
reductively cleave a portion of the disulfide bridges (see equation 1). The<br>
products formed have lower molar masses, are soluble in aqueous alkaline<br>
solution and can be used for dyeing since they also have an affinity for fibers, for<br>
example cellulosic fibers.<br>
A more or less complete back-oxidation of the dye takes place in the presence of<br>
atmospheric oxygen, in accordance with equation 2.<br><br>
Since, in the dyeing operation, the dyebath containing the reduced dye has to be<br>
protected against unwanted oxidation of the dye by air, either reducing<br>
chemicals are introduced into the dyebath or a more far-reaching cathodic dye<br>
reduction is carried out during dye manufacture or the preparation of the dyeing<br>
liquor (see WO 99/11716). The procedure of WO 99/11716 makes it possible to<br><br>
dispense with the continued use of reducing agents in the production of reduced<br>
dyes and their use in continuous dyeing processes provided the dye<br>
concentration employed is sufficiently high, for example 50 g/l of solid sulfur<br>
dye, so that the reduction equivalents introduced into the dye liquor together<br>
with the reduced dye are able to compensate the disruptive influence of air<br>
oxidation. Such an approach is particularly useful for the production of relatively<br>
concentrated products or dye liquors which are only briefly exposed to the<br>
oxidative action of atmospheric oxygen during continuous dyeing. A dye box<br>
holding 25 I of dye liquor is turned over within less than 3 min at a customary<br>
fabric speed of 60 m/min, a linear meter weight of 200 g/m2 and a wet pickup<br>
of 80%.<br>
There is no prior art technique for applying sulfur dyes in exhaust dyeing, for<br>
example on circulating liquor/stationary goods machines, jet dyeing machines,<br>
etc, which by analogy also includes the continuous warp yarn dyeing ranges for<br>
denim manufacture. The long c yeing time is responsible for long residence times<br>
of the dye in the dyebath, which is exposed to continual oxidative action of<br>
atmospheric oxygen during th s period, In addition, dye concentrations used in<br>
exhaust dyeing are relatively low at thes commencement of dyeing and decrease<br>
further during the dyeing process by reason of bath exhaustion. The instability of<br>
the dyebath to undesirable atmospheric oxidation accordingly increases more<br>
and more as the dyeing progresses.<br>
By way of illustration, a typical example will now be calculated for a dark<br>
exhaust dyeing:<br>
To dye 1 kg of fiber material to a depth of 5% (reckoned as solid sulfur dye) at a<br>
liquor ratio of 10:1, a total of 50 g of dye will be included per 10 I of dyebath,<br>
so that the initial concentration of dye in the dyebath will be 5 g/l. Assuming a<br>
bath exhaustion of 70% for the dyeing operation, the concentration of dye will<br>
have decreased to 1.5 g/l of dye by the end of the dyeing process. In dyeing<br>
processes which are known from the prior art, exhaust bath stabilization to<br>
oxidative influences can therefore only be achieved through the addition of<br>
appropriate amounts of reducing chemicals such as glucose or hydroxyacetone.<br><br>
If these additives are not used, the sulfur dye will undergo uncontrolled back-<br>
oxidation during the dyeing operation. Observable consequences are poor<br>
reproducibility of the depth of shade, unlevelness and poor crockfastnesses.<br>
Warp dyeing ranges customarily contain relatively high use concentrations of dye<br>
(50 g/l of solid dye) and relatively high liquor volumes, so that bath stability to<br>
atmospheric oxygen appears to be higher. But these dyeing techniques require<br>
the baths to have a very long use time, since it is customary to enter the dyebath<br>
with wet fabric and so only small amounts of the dyeing liquor are carried out of<br>
the dyebaths. A bath volume of 4 000 litre and a production of 15 000 kg of warp<br>
yarn per day and assuming a squeeze-off effect of 70% at prewetting and of 95%<br>
at dyeing results in a liquor consumption of 15 000 x 0.25= 3 750 litre per day, so<br>
that the average residence time for the dyeing liquor in the dyeing range turns<br>
out to be one day. If no reducing agents were used, the phenomenon of ending<br>
(that is, hue changes within a dye ng lot of 20 000 m lengths for example) would<br>
be inevitable.<br>
There are also literature proposals for using indirect cathodic reducing methods.<br>
See for example Textilveredlung 32 (1997) 204-209, Journal of Applied<br>
Electrochemistry 28 (1998) 1243-1250, Recent Res. Devel. in Electrochem. 1<br>
(1998) 245-264 and WO 90/15182. In these processes, a regenerable redox<br>
system performs the function of the soluble reducing agent, so that the required<br>
bath stability is ensured. Examples of such systems are anthraquinonoids, iron<br>
complexes with amines or hydroxy carboxyliic acids. But with these processes too<br>
it is not possible to dispense with the use of chemicals.<br>
The present invention, then, rests on the surprising discovery that sulfur dyes can<br>
perform the function of a mediator in exhaust dyeings too, and adequate bath<br>
stability can be achieved, when ongoing regeneration of the reducing state can<br>
be achieved. This is achieved according to the present invention when adequate<br>
circulation of the dyebath through a suitably attached electrolytic cell is made<br>
possible during the dyeing process.<br><br>
The present invention accordingly provides a process for dyeing fiber materials<br>
with sulfur dyes by regenerating the dyebath redox potential, which comprises,<br>
during the dyeing process, the dyeing liquor being circulated between the dyeing<br>
apparatus and an attached electrolytic cell and the sulfur dye which has been<br>
unwantedly oxidized in the dyebath being cathodically reduced in the electrolytic<br>
cell.<br>
The process of the present invention can be executed for example as an exhaust<br>
process, or else as a continuous process. Useful dyeing apparatus includes<br>
accordingly, for the exhaust process, circulating liquor/stationary goods<br>
machines, for example yarn dyeing machines, reel becks, beam dyeing machines<br>
and jet or overflow dyeing machines. For the continuous process, in contrast,<br>
the dyeing ranges which are customary for this process are used.<br>
The dyebath has to be circulated between the dyeing apparatus and the<br>
electrolytic cell in accordance with the dye concentration and the oxidative<br>
burden. When the oxidative burden is high and the dye concentration low, the<br>
liquor has to be circulated at a higher volume flow rate than when the dye<br>
concentration is high and the oxygen burden low.<br>
The cathodically reduced dye passes from the electrolytic cell to the dyeing<br>
apparatus and the partially oxidized dyebath flows from the dyeing apparatus to<br>
the electrolytic cell. The requisite iquor exchange in l/min between the<br>
electrolytic cell and the dyeing apparatus depends on plural general conditions.<br>
These include for example dye concentration, desired degree of reduction in the<br>
dyeing apparatus, maximum degree of reduction achievable for a sulfur dye by<br>
cathodic reduction, the minimum degree of sulfur dye reduction required for<br>
dyeing, the current density which can be used with the given cell, and also the<br>
oxygen input into the dyeing apparatus (oxidative burden).<br>
When concentrations of sulfur dye are high, as is usually the case in warp yarn<br>
dyeing operations, it is also possible to contemplate a batchwise regeneration of<br>
the sulfur dye and hence an intermittent bath circulation.<br><br>
A person of ordinary skill in the art is readily able to calculate the requisite mass<br>
transfer between cell and dyeing apparatus given knowledge of the present<br>
invention and of the essential general conditions mentioned.<br>
If, for example, a current strength of 10A per kg of fiber is assumed as being<br>
necessary to compensate the oxygen input and if the amount of dye available in<br>
the dyebath circulation is put at 0.01 mol/l, then a dyebath circulation of 5 l/min<br>
is needed in order that the conversion achieved in the cell may not increase to<br>
above 10% of the existing dye concentration. A circulation rate of 10 l/min kg<br>
will change the dye solution in the reduced state by 5% only.<br>
Depending on general conditions, the liquor exchange per kg of fiber will vary<br>
between 0.5 l/min kg and 100 l/min kg, preferably between 1 and 50 l/min kg<br>
and most preferably between 5 and 30 l/min kg.<br>
The dye concentration in the dyebath in the process of the present invention is<br>
preferably in the range from 0.5 to 100 g/l of pure dye and more preferably in<br>
the range from 5 to 50 g/l of pure dye.<br>
The process of the present invent on is advantageously carried out at<br>
temperatures from 20 to 1 35°C and more preferably at temperatures from 60 to<br>
95°C.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process according to the present invention, the<br>
dyeing operation is influenced by open loop control of the redox potential. This is<br>
accomplished by adjusting the cell current, making it possible to change or<br>
closed loop control the redox potential in the dyebath within certain potential<br>
limits. The adjustable potential rar ge is determined by the sulfur dye used, its<br>
concentration and also by pH and dyeing temperature.<br>
The cell current is defined in particular by the oxygen input and varies between<br>
0.5 and 50 A/kg and preferably between 1 and 10 A/kg for customary dyeing<br>
apparatus. By employing suitable neasures, such as a protective gas<br>
atmosphere of nitrogen for example, the values can be lowered.<br><br>
The dyebath pH is for example between 9 and 14 and preferably between 11<br>
and 13.<br>
The redox potential in the dyebath is defined by the dye and the desired dyeing<br>
outcome and is between -300 mV and -900 mV and preferably between<br>
-400 mV and -700 mV.<br>
The dyeing apparatus has attached to it an electrolytic cell with liquor<br>
circulation. The electrolytic cell used can be any electrolytic cell available from<br>
cell manufacturers or on the market. Normal or else multicathode cells can be<br>
used. To avoid anodic back-oxidation of the sulfur dye, however, the electrolytic<br>
cell is preferably constructed as a divided cell, and in turn it is particularly<br>
preferable to use a membrane electrolytic cell. Most preferably, a cation<br>
exchange membrane is used as separator.<br>
The conducting electrolyte used is preferably selected from alkaline solutions,<br>
preferably alkaline solutions of alkali metal salts, especially of sodium hydroxide,<br>
potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium chloride or sodium sulfate.<br>
Particular preference is given to using the alkali added to the dyebath,<br>
advantageously aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, aqueous potassium<br>
hydroxide solution or sodium carbonate. Similarly, salts added during dyeing,<br>
preferably sodium chloride or sodium sulfate, can improve conductivity as<br>
electrolytes.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the process according to the present<br>
invention, this process is carried out under an inert atmosphere. To this end, the<br>
dyebath in the dyeing apparatus is blanketed with nitrogen or a noble gas and<br>
more preferably argon.<br>
Since the basic oxidative burden is reduced by reducing the partial pressure of<br>
atmospheric oxygen, it is thus possible to dimension the requisite electrolytic<br>
cells with smaller cell currents and hence more economically.<br><br>
7<br>
The process of the present invention is unreservedly useful for all sulfur dyes.<br>
Not only oxidized dyes, as-synthesized filter cakes but also cathodically or<br>
chemically prereduced dyes and eye preparations can be used. Particular<br>
preference is given to sulfur dyes produced by cathodic reduction as are<br>
described for example in DE-A 1 906 083 or WO 99/11716.<br>
The process according to the present invention can be used to dye all fiber<br>
materials which are sulfur dyeable in principle. These are in particular fiber<br>
materials composed of cellulose and polyamide and also of cellulose-polyester<br>
and cellulose-polyamide blends. Fiber materials preferably refers to textile fiber<br>
materials.<br>
When dyeing with sulfur dyes, atmospheric oxygen introduced into the dyebath<br>
is reduced by the reduced sulfur dye present. In the process according to the<br>
present invention, the redox behavior of sulfur dyes, which is characterized by a<br>
plurality of reduction states (see for example Journal of Applied Electrochemistry<br>
28 (1998) 1243-1250 and Recen: Res. Devel. in Electrochem. 1 (1998) 245-<br>
264), is advantageously exploited by working with adequate cell circulation and<br>
cathodic supplementary reduction of the oxidized sulfur dye, so that stable bath<br>
states are realized.<br>
In the process according to the present invention, the sulfur dye performs the<br>
function of the reducing agents or cathodically regenerable mediators hitherto<br>
considered indispensable in exhaust dyeing. It is therefore possible to dispense<br>
with the use of chemicals which create costs in procurement and wastewater<br>
treatment, and an advantageous ecological overall balance is achieved.<br>
Unexpectedly, the low concentrations of sulfur dye used in exhaust processes<br>
are sufficient to carry out the process according to the present invention. It is<br>
very particularly advantageous to practice the process of the present invention<br>
when dyeing from a stationary bath, it merely being necessary to replenish the<br>
dyebath with the sulfur dye carried out with the fabric.<br><br>
The use examples 1 -5 which follow illustrate typical possibilities for the process<br>
according to the present invention. To achieve a clear demonstration of its<br>
effect, the sample dyeings were commenced with oxidized sulfur dye which is<br>
not directly suitable for dyeing and only able to go onto the material after<br>
cathodic reduction.<br>
Use example 1 - Exhaust dyeing with Sulfur Black 1<br>
The electrolytic cell used was a cell divided by a cation exchange membrane.<br>
Cathode: stainless steel cathodes total cathode surface area 0.43 m2, volume in<br>
total 2I.<br>
Anode: stainless steel plate 0.01 m2 in area. Volume 0.3 I.<br>
The anolyte used is 0.1 M NaOH.<br>
Cell current: 0.9 A, cell voltage between 2.7 V and 4.1 V<br>
The dyebath (total volume 2 I) is pumped at 150 ml/min through the cathode<br>
space, so that an ongoing regeneration of the dyebath takes place through<br>
exchange with the catholyte.<br>
Dyebath/catholyte composition:<br>
10 g/l of Cassulfon® Carbon CMR paste from DyStar Textilfarben GmbH &amp; Co.<br>

0.6 g/l of wetting agent<br>
3 g/l of NaOH<br>
The dyebath contains a bleached cotton drawn-loop knit (sample 1) having a<br>
mass of 6.9 g. Liquor circulation and heating is provided by a magnetic stirrer.<br>
The catholyte temperature is brought to 70°C. During an electrolysis time of<br>
197 min, the redox potential decreases from -259 mV (vs. Ag/AgCI, 3 M KCI<br>
reference) to -499 mV. The dyed sample 1 is removed, rinsed with water and<br>
oxidized with peroxide/acetic acid as per usual.<br>
The dyebath is entered with a further sample (sample 2, mass 6.9 g) which is<br>
dyed for 30 min by continuing the electrolytic operation. The redox potential<br><br>
y<br>
decreases to -545 mV. Sample 2 is removed after 30 min and finished as<br>
already described.<br>
Dyebath pH is about 12.2<br>
The depth of shade can be described by color locus measurement.<br>
Results:<br>
As the L values show, sample 2 is darker even though the dyeing time was<br>
shorter. This is attributable to the continued buildup of the redox potential in the<br>
dyebath. Despite the low dye concentration, this confirms successful dye<br>
reduction under the conditions of exhaust dyeing.<br><br>
Use example 2 - Exhaust dyeing with Sulfur Black 1<br>

1	75 min, the redox potential decreases from -309 mV (vs. Ag/AgCI, 3 M KCI<br>
reference) to -440 mV. The dyed sample 3 is removed, rinsed with water and<br>
oxidized with peroxide/acetic acid as per usual.<br>
The dyebath is entered with a further sample (sample 4, mass 7.0 g) which is<br>
dyed for 80 min by continuing the: electrolytic operation. The redox potential<br>
decreases to -437 - -431 mV. Sample 4 is removed after 80 min and finished as<br>
already described.<br>
Dyebath pH is about 12.1 - 12.2.<br>
The depth of shade can be described by color locus measurement.<br>
Results:<br>
As the L values show, sample 4 if; darker even though the dyeing time was<br>
shorter. This is attributable to the continued buildup of the redox potential in the<br>
dyebath. Despite the low dye concentration, this confirms successful dye<br>
reduction under the conditions of sxhaust dyeing.<br><br>
Use example 3 - Dyeing on a laboratory denim dyeing range<br>
Electrolytic cell:<br>
The electrolytic cell used is a cell divided by a cation exchange membrane.<br><br>

geometric surface area of 0.04 m2. Volume 1.5 I.<br>
The anolyte used is 1 M NaOH.<br>
Cell current: 10 A, cell voltage between 3.0 V and 4.7 V.<br>
A Looptex laboratory dyeing range for denim dyeings is coupled to the cell. After<br>
an electrolysis time of 17.5 h at 10 A (75 Ah) to reach the dyeing potential, a<br>
portion of the catholyte (4 I) is pumped from the cell into the dyeing range and<br>
samples 5 and 6 are dyed at respectively 50°C(-491 mV) and 80°C(-567 mV)<br>
(yarn strands 1 50 m in length, raw cotton yarn).<br>
Dyeing program: prewetting (3 g/l of wetting agent), squeezing off, dipping in<br>
the sulfur vat, squeezing off, air oxidation, subsequent rinse in cold water.<br>
After dyeings 5 and 6, the dysbath is pumped back into the cell and again<br>
reduced by cathodic reduction.<br>
After a reduction time of 3.7 h at 10 A (3.7 Ah), again a portion of the cell<br>
contents is pumped into the dyeing range and samples 7 and 8 are dyed<br>

By regenerating the bath contents it is thus possible to ensure maintenance of<br>
the reduced state.<br>
Dyebath pH is about 12.5-12.7.<br>
The depth of shade can be desc ibed by color locus measurement.<br>

Use example 4 - EC dyeing of E C-reduced sulfur black<br>
A solution of 20 ml/1 of CassulforT Carbon CMR from DyStar Textilfarben GmbH<br>
&amp; Co. Deutschland KG (about. 30-40% solution of Leuco Sulfur Black 1) is<br>
electrolyzed at pH 12 and room temperature in apparatus as described in use<br>
example 1 in the presence of 20 g/l of Na2SO4 anhydrous. The anolyte used is<br>
again aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (40 g/l of NaOH). The solution of the<br>
reduced sulfur dye has a reducing agent equivalents content of 0.075 mol/l<br>
(determined by iodometric titration) at the start of electrolysis. The cathodic<br>
reduction is carried out at a current density of 0.26 mA/cm2 in line with the low<br>
sulfur dye content of the catho yte. The electrolysis is ended at an analytically<br>
determined content of 0.125 mol/l. The solution then has a reducing agent<br>
equivalents content of 335 Ah based on 1 kg of solid sulfur dye. The thus<br>
prepared solution of the sulfur dye can be used directly for dyeing, for example<br>
as described in use example 1.<br>

The dyebath contains a prewashed bleached cotton drawn-loop knit having a<br>
mass of 8 kg. Liquor circulation and fabric agitation are provided by the pump<br>
associated with the jet. Heat is supplied by an indirect steam heating system.<br>
The dyeing was carried out under protective gas atmosphere (nitrogen) in order<br>
that air access may be minimized. To this end, a 10 i/min nitrogen stream is<br>
continuously passed into the apparatus.<br>
Fabric speed is 50 m/min. Liquor circulation through the cell is 30 I/min.<br>
The catholyte temperature is brought to about 55°C, after which cell circulation<br>
is connected up and heating continues to 76°C. During an electrolysis time of<br>
about 80 min, the redox potential is between -630 mV and -720 mV when<br>
measured in the cell and between -460 nnv* and -432 mV when measured in the<br>
dyeing jet (vs. Ag/AgCI, 3 M KCI reference).<br>
Dyebath pH is about 12.1 - 12.2.<br>
After overflow rinsing, the black dyeing is finished in conventional manner, for<br>
example by oxidation with hydrogen peroxide/acetic acid, rinsing and buffering.<br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	 A process for dyeing fiber materials with sulfur dyes by regenerating the<br>
dyebath redox potential, which comprises, during the dyeing process, the<br>
dyeing liquor being circulated between the dyeing apparatus and an<br>
attached electrolytic cell characterized in that when the electrolytic cell is<br>
in operation the sulfur dye goes (directly to the cathode to receive<br>
electrons for cathodic reduction.<br>
2.	 A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the dyebath redox potential is<br>
closed loop controlled by the cell current.<br>
3.	 A process as claimed in claim 1 and/or 2, wherein the electrolytic cell used<br>
is a divided electrolytic cell and more advantageously a membrane<br>
electrolytic cell.<br>
4.	 A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 3, wherein the<br>
conducting electrolyte used is selected from alkaline solutions and more<br>
preferably from alkaline solutions of alkali metal salts, especially of sodium<br>
hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium chloride or<br>
sodium sulfate.<br>
5.	 A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 4, wherein the dye<br>
concentration in the dyebath is in the range from 0.5 to 100 g/l of pure<br>
dye and more preferably in the range; from 5 to 50 g/l of pure dye.<br>
6.	 A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 5, conducted at a<br>
temperature in the range from 20 to 135°C and more preferably in the<br>
range from 60 to 95°C.<br>
7.	 A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 6, conducted under an<br>
inert atmosphere.<br><br>
8. A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 7, wherein the fiber<br>
materials used are fiber materials composed of cellulose or polyamide or<br>
cellulose-polyester or cellulose-polyamide blends.<br><br>
The present invention relates to a process for dyeing fiber materials with sulfur<br>
dyes by regenerating the dyebath redox potential, which comprises, during the<br>
dyeing process, the dyeing liquor being circulated between the dyeing apparatus<br>
and an attached electrolytic cell and the sulfur dye which has been unwantedly<br>
oxidized in the dyebath being cathodically reduced in the electrolytic cell.</td>
