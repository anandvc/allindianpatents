COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br><br><br>
AERATABLE AND AERATED PRODUCTS<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under<br>
the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office<br>
at 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
WO 2008/110502	PCT/EP2008/052738<br>
-1 -<br>
AERATABLE AND AERATED PRODUCTS<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an aerated product, as well an aeratable product, that 5     comprises water, liquid oils, salt and sugar esters, as well as to food and non-food products comprising such an aerated product as well as a method to produce such an aerated product.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
10 In aerated products such as ice cream, whipped cream, mousse, toppings and aerated cake fillings, the air bubbles are at least in part stabilized by emulsified fat. Conventionally, the fat is substantially solid at the processing and storage temperatures, since liquid fat destabilizes foams. For example ice cream mixes in which greater than about 50% of the fat is liquid at the processing temperature cannot<br>
15 be aerated to a high quality ice cream by conventional routes. Similarly, cream in which the fat is liquid cannot be whipped; this is why cookery books say that you should chill cream before whipping it. Furthermore, to the extent that such products can be aerated the foams have poor stability.<br>
20 Solid fats contain a high proportion of saturated fatty acids, for example dairy fat (60-65%) or coconut oil (90%). Health-conscious consumers are now looking for products which have all the properties of the traditional products but which are healthier. One way of achieving this would be to replace the saturated fats with unsaturated fats. However, unsaturated fats contain a substantial proportion of liquid fat at typical<br>
25 processing and / or storage temperatures. Thus it is not possible simply to replace the saturated fats with unsaturated fats.<br>
There have been previous attempts to produce aerated emulsions, such as whipped cream and ice cream, using fats with higher liquid contents. WO 94 / 017672<br>
30 discloses whippable, water-continuous fat emulsions comprising 10-40 weight-% (wt %) of a fat mixture obtained by blending two fats, such as sunflower oil and palm mid-fraction. A certain amount of solid fat was still found necessary. EP-A 1 212 947 discloses ice creams comprising a fat phase and having overrun of at least 90%, characterised in that at least 50 w/w % of the fat phase is liquid at -5°C. A particular<br>
35     apparatus, in the form of an aeration means that displaces less than 40% of the internal<br><br>
WO 2008/110502<br><br>
PCT/EP2008/052738<br><br>
-2-<br>
volume of the freezer barrel, was required. Thus there remains a need to provide emulsions containing high levels of liquid fats which aerate well using conventional equipment and which have good foam stability.<br>
5     The same problems arise for aerated products in the field of home and personal care such as soaps, razor gels, hair mousse etc.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that an aerated product comprising water and at least one liquid oil can be formed, when the aerated product comprises at least one salt and at 10      least one sugar ester.<br>
Therefore, an embodiment of the present invention relates to an aeratable product<br>
comprising water and at least one liquid oil, characterized in that the aeratable product<br>
comprises<br>
15	(i)      at least one salt and<br>
(ii)     at least one sucrose ester.<br>
The aeratable product is the formulation, which is then aerated.<br>
20     A further embodiment of the present invention relates to an aerated product comprising water and at least one liquid oil, characterized in that the aerated product comprises (i)      at least one salt and (ii)     at least one sucrose ester.<br>
25 Beside the fact that a foam with liquid oil can be formed, a foam according to the present invention also has good foam properties, such as good overrun and a good stability (it is stable for days at ambient temperature).<br>
The  stability  is  determined  by  measuring  the  height of the  foam.   It  is  given  in 30     percentages, which means that 100% means the height has not changed and for examples 50 % means that the height of the foam is half as it was at the start of the measurement.<br><br>
WO 2008/110502	PCT/EP2008/052738<br>

Aeration and overrun<br>
The term "aerated" means that gas has been intentionally incorporated into the composition, for example by mechanical means. The term "aeratable" means that gas can be incorporated into the composition, for example by whipping. The gas can 5 be any gas, but is preferably, particularly in the context of food products, a food-grade gas such as air, nitrogen, nitrous oxide, or carbon dioxide.<br>
The extent of aeration is defined in terms of "overrun".   In the context of the present invention, %overrun is defined in volume terms as: 10<br>
%overrun = ((volume of aerated product - volume of mix) / volume of mix) x 100%<br>
where the volumes are the volumes of a fixed mass of product / mix, respectively.<br>
15 The aerated product according to the present invention is stable, which means that it keeps its form as well as its properties over time. Foam stability is defined in the context of the present invention as the percentage of the overrun that remains at time T after aeration of the product at time T = 0<br>
%Stability = (Overrun (T)/Overrun (0)) x 100%.<br>
20<br>
Aeratable products within the scope of this invention comprise water and an emulsified fat phase. Such compositions are premixes for any kind of aerated products. It includes premixes for aerated desserts, mousses and frozen confections, and whipping cream or non-dairy cream, as well as premixes for the home care use, such as premixes for foamy<br>
25 soap products as wells as premixes for the personal care products such as premixes for razor foams or foamy soap products. All these premixes are subsequently aerated to form the final product.<br>
By a food product is also meant an aeratable product which, where aerated, is a food 30      product.   Likewise by a non-food product is meant an aeratable product which, when aerated, is a non-food product.<br>
Water<br>
The aeratable product according to the present invention comprises water. The water 35      content can vary depending on the use of the aerated product.<br><br>
WO 2008/110502<br><br>
PCT/EP2008/052738<br><br>
-4-<br>
The aeratable product can contain up to 99.5 wt-% of water, depending on the level of oil, salt and other ingredients added to the formulation. The water content can be 5 - 99.5 wt-%, based on the total weight of the aeratable product, preferably 20 - 95 wt-% of water.<br>
5 Consequently, the aerated product can contain up to 99.5 wt-% of water, depending on the level of oil, salt and other ingredients added to the formulation. The water content can be 5 - 99.5 wt-%, based on the total weight of the aerated product, preferably 20 - 95 wt-% of water.<br>

A preferred method for producing an aerated product is as follows: the oil, sucrose ester and aqueous phase are emulsified in the absence of salt using equipment known to the art. After emulsification, salt is added and the foam is created by whipping the system using equipment known to the girt. 5<br>
The present invention will now be described further with reference to the following non-limiting examples. If not otherwise stated the percentages are based on weight and the temperature is given in degree Celsius.<br>
10     Experiments<br>
Preparation of the formulation, aeration and stability experiments are performed at room temperature (ca. 22°C), unless otherwise stated.<br>
Unless otherwise stated, the Sisterna sucrose esters are dissolved in water at 80°C, as 15      recommended by the manufacturer and allowed to cool to room temperature.<br>
Sisterna sucrose esters are a mixture of sucrose palmitate and sucrose stearate, where the number in SPXX indicates the percentage of monoester in the system. All remaining ingredients except the salt are then added.<br>

Then, unless otherwise stated, the foams are created by first emulsifying the oil in the water phase in the absence of salt using a Silverson mixer for 60 seconds with a L4R fine mesh at 60% of the maximum speed. Salt was added immediately after emulsification and the system was aerated using a hand-held whipping device (SmartCafe™). Other<br>
25     means, known to the art, may be used as well.<br>
After creation of the foam, it is stored at room temperature, unless otherwise stated.<br>
The foam height is measured 1 day and 1 week after aeration by visual inspection of the 30     foam and reading of the foam height using a ruler.<br>
