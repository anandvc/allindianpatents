				<td>APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR LEVEL-DEPENDENT COMPANDING<br>
FOR WIRELESS AUDIO NOISE REDUCTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to wireless audio microphone systems.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In order to provide audio communication between a talker and those listening to the talker,<br>
audio electronic equipment is often utilized to facilitate the communication. The term "talker"<br>
can connote a variety of input sources, including a person articulating language or a musical<br>
band playing a song. Moreover, the talker may require an untethered connection to the audio<br>
electronic equipment for greater mobility. A wireless connection between the acoustical<br>
speaker and the electronics equipment can be provided by frequency (FM) radio techniques in<br>
which the audio electronics equipment comprises a transmitter (which includes an encoder) and<br>
a receiver (which includes an decoder). In such an arrangement, the transmitter processes the<br>
audio signal as provided by the talker and modulates the signal so that the transformed signal<br>
can be conveyed over the wireless path to a receiver. The receiver demodulates the received<br>
signal, and the processed received signal is then presented to circuitry that may amplify the<br>
processed received signal. The corresponding signal may be recorded by additional recording<br>
circuitry or may be converted into an audio signal with an acoustical speaker arrangement.<br>
The quality of the processed received signal, and consequently the associated audio signal, can<br>
be degraded by any "noise" that is generated in the wireless path between the encoder and the<br>
decoder. (The term "noise" is associated with a randomly varying signal superimposed on the<br>
desired, undistorted signal). There are a number of sources of noise with respect to the wireless<br>
path, including transmitter VCO (voltage controlled oscillator) phase noise, transmitter<br>
synthesizer stability, the quality of the FM detector in the receiver, receiver RF band pass<br>
filtering, and the receiver"s local oscillator. Moreover, with FM radio techniques the wireless<br>
path is susceptible to FM noise generated when a weak radio signal as received by the receiver.<br>
The FM noise results in the audio signal (as provided to the listener) having "breathing"<br>
characteristics because of the similar sound characteristics of someone breathing. The<br>
"breathing" effect is caused by the dynamic noise in conjunction with the type of companding.<br>
Moreover, the degree of the "breathing" effect increases with the dynamic noise level. The<br>
resulting effect can be noticeable to the listener and is perceived as a degradation of the audio<br>
signal. Thus, a solution that ameliorates the "breathing" effect is an advancement in wireless<br>
microphone technology.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention mitigates the "breathing effect" associated with a wireless<br>
communications path between an encoder and a decoder of a wireless audio noise reduction<br>
system. Otherwise, the listener perceives a sound that is characteristic of someone breathing.<br>
The "breathing" effect is caused by the dynamic noise in conjunction with the type of<br>
companding. Moreover, the degree of the "breathing" effect increases with dynamic noise<br>
level.<br>
The present invention provides apparatus and method to mitigate the corresponding breathing<br>
effect. According to the present invention, the wireless audio noise reduction system comprises<br>
an encoder and a decoder. The encoder comprises a variable compressor that invokes<br>
compression whenever the input signal is above a first input threshold, a frequency modulation<br>
(FM) modulator, and a matching network that interfaces the modulator to a first antenna that<br>
transmits over the wireless communications path. The decoder receives a signal from the<br>
encoder over the wireless communications path through a second antenna. The decoder<br>
comprises a FM detector and a variable expander that invokes expanding operation above a<br>
second input threshold.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the present invention is presented illustrating an architecture of<br>
the encoder and decoder having a communications path such as a radio path or a cable.<br>
Moreover, an electrical design of the encoder and decoder is presented with commercially<br>
available components.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 shows a system architecture of wireless audio noise reduction system 100 in<br>
accordance with the present invention. Input source 101 generates an acoustical signal that is<br>
processed by input device 103 over transmission path 102. While Figure 1 depicts input source<br>
101 as being a person, one skilled in the art appreciates that input source 101 can a person, a<br>
musical instrument, a compact disc (CD), or any generator of a audio frequency band signal.<br>
Input device 103 processes the signal produced by input source 101. Consequently, the<br>
selection of input device 103 is dependent upon the selection of input source 101. For example,<br>
if input source 101 is a person, a microphone is applicable as input device 103. If input source<br>
101 is a CD, then the electronics associated with a CD player is applicable as input device 103.<br>
Transmission path 102 is dependent upon the selection the selection of 101 and 103. Some<br>
examples of transmission path 102 include air or a cable connecting 101 and 103.<br>
HPF 105 is a high pass filter that reduces unwanted noise (e.g. wind noise while talking in a<br>
car) that can be generated through transmission path 102. However, the need for including HPF<br>
105 is dependent upon the characteristics of input source 101, transmission path 102, and input<br>
device 103. Pre-emphasis circuit 107 enhances the gain of the higher frequency component of<br>
the presented signal. It is well known in the art that the inclusion of a pre-emphasis circuit<br>
increases the resulting signal to noise ratio (S/N) with frequency modulation techniques. The<br>
resulting signal is the input signal to variable compressor 109.<br>
Variable compressor 109 has a gain characteristic that is dependent upon the level of the input<br>
signal. The gain characteristic is discussed in relation to Figure 2, while the operation of<br>
variable compressor 109 is discussed in more detail with Figure 3. Variable compressor 109<br>
invokes compression only if the input signal to 109 is above a first input threshold. If not (i.e.<br>
the input signal is below the first input threshold), variable compressor 109 has a fixed gain<br>
(typically between 35 and 50 dB). In other words, the compression characteristic of variable<br>
compressor 109 is disabled.<br>
The output of variable compressor 109 is processed by modulator 111. Modulator 111 utilizes<br>
frequency modulation (FM) techniques. The resulting output of 111 is processed by matching<br>
network 113. Matching network 113 matches the impedance of the encoder to the impedance<br>
of antenna 115 and provides the desired signal level for transmission. Communications is<br>
established between antenna 115 and antenna 117 over radio frequency (RF) path 116.<br>
Alternative embodiments can utilize other types of transmission media other than a radio<br>
frequency medium. Alternative examples include an infrared transmission medium and a<br>
visible light medium.<br>
The received signal that is received by antenna 117 of a decoder is processed by FM detector<br>
119. FM detector 119 utilizes FM techniques to convert a FM signal into a baseband audio<br>
signal. Amplifier 121 amplifies the output signal of FM detector 119 to an appropriate level.<br>
Depending upon the characteristics of the received signal, amplifier 121 may not be required.<br>
The output from amplifier 121 is processed by LPF 123, which is a low pass filter. The<br>
response of LPF 123 in conjunction with the response of HPF 105 creates an effective band<br>
pass filter that reduces ultra-sonic and sub-sonic information that may impede the operation of<br>
variable expander 125. The output of LPF 123 is then processed by variable expander 125.<br>
Variable expander 125 has an inverse gain characteristic of variable compressor 109 in order to<br>
recover the input signal from input source 101. Variable expander 125 invokes expanding<br>
operation if the input signal is above a second threshold level. Below the second threshold<br>
level, expander 125 has a fixed gain to compensate for the corresponding fixed gain of variable<br>
compressor 109. The operation of expander 125 is discussed in greater detail with Figure 4.<br>
The output of variable expander 125 is then processed to de-emphasis circuit 127. De-emphasis<br>
circuit has an essentially inverse gain function of pre-emphasis circuit 105. Thus, de-emphasis<br>
circuit 127 has a higher gain for the lower-frequency component of an input signal. The<br>
processed signal is presented to output device 129. Examples of output device 129 include a<br>
mixing console, an acoustical speaker, and a recording device.<br>
Even though Figure 1 shows a wireless system, the present invention is applicable to a non-<br>
wireless system in which RF path 116 is replaced with a non-wireless transmission path such as<br>
a cable, infrared transmission medium, or a visible Jight medium as can be appreciated by one<br>
skilled in the art. The degree of "breathing" is dependent upon the amount of signal degradation<br>
incurred with the non-wireless path. Moreover, as can be appreciated by one skilled in the art,<br>
the present invention is applicable to audio communications system utilizing modulation<br>
schemes other than frequency modulation.<br>
Figure 2 shows a relationship of the gain function of variable compressor 109 that is shown in<br>
Figure 1. Compressor input 201 (in dB) is mapped to compressor output 202 (in dB).<br>
Whenever compressor input 201 is above .11 206, variable compressor 109 invokes<br>
compression operation as reflected by curve 203. Graphical point 205 corresponds to II 206 in<br>
which the associated compressor output is Ol 207. If compressor input 201 is below II 206,<br>
then variable compressor 109 has a gain of essentially one as represented by curve 204.<br>
In engineering the gain function of variable compressor 109, the designer must consider the<br>
voltage rails associated with 109. The associated voltage levels of the processed signal are<br>
restrained by the voltage levels of the power supply. Graphical point 205 is chosen in order to<br>
satisfy the restraints as imposed by the voltage rails and the dynamic range requirement of<br>
wireless audio noise reduction system 100. The gain function of variable expander 125 can be<br>
derived from Figure 2 by replacing compressor input 201 with the expander output and by<br>
replacing compressor output 202 with the expander input. By increasing the compression ratio<br>
(as reflected in curve 203), the greater the value of compression input I1 206. The increased<br>
value of 11 206 is desirable because the "breathing" effect (that is induced by the noise<br>
generated on RF path 116) is mitigated. However, increasing the compression ratio requires<br>
that the expansion ratio increase accordingly. However, with increased compression and<br>
expansion ratios, the component tolerances of variable compressor 109 and variable expander<br>
125 become more critical. If the compression and the expansion ratios become too large, the<br>
practicality of wireless audio noise reduction system 100 is compromised.<br>
Figure 3 shows a functional diagram of variable compressor 109. The input signal from pre-<br>
emphasis circuit 107 is connected to input 300 of VCA (voltage controlled amplifier) 301.<br>
VCA 301 is an amplifier whose gain varies with control voltage 302. The output of VCA 301 is<br>
processed by amplifier 303 and LPF 305. LPF 305 is a low pass filter and functions as an<br>
integrator to provide a desired time constant to mitigate undesired transients. LPF 305 is<br>
optional to the design in accordance with the required filtering characteristics of the encoder"s<br>
feedback. Output 316 of variable compressor 109 is processed by modulator 111 as well as<br>
processed by a feedback loop circuit configuration comprising RMS detector 307, compressor<br>
ratio and threshold circuit 309, and amplifier 311. RMS detector 307 processes the output from<br>
LPF 305 so that the output of RMS detector 307 is representative of the root mean square<br>
(RMS) value of output 316. Circuit ratio and threshold circuit 309 processes the output of RMS<br>
detector 307 in order to invoke compressor operation above compressor input I1 206.<br>
Moreover, circuit 309 insures that the signal levels of VCA 301 and 307 are compatible. Bias<br>
offset circuit 313 is incorporated to insure that the bias level of VCA 301 is compatible with the<br>
bias level of RMS detector 307. Trim circuit 315 provides symmetry in the associated<br>
waveform in order to reduce distortion of the output of VCA 301.<br>
Figure 4 shows a functional diagram of variable expander 125 as shown in Figure 1. Input 400<br>
is connected to the output of LPF 123 in Figure 1. Output 412 is connected to the input of de-<br>
emphasis circuit 127 in Figure 1. The functionality of VCA 401, expansion ratio and threshold<br>
circuit 405, RMS detector 407, bias offset circuit 409, and trim circuit 411 correspond to the<br>
functionality of VCA 301, compressor ratio and threshold circuit 309, RMS detector 307, bias<br>
offset circuit 313, and trim circuit 315 respectively as shown in Figure 3. The design of<br>
expansion ratio and threshold circuit 405 must account for the fact that gain function of VCA<br>
401 is essentially the inverse function of the gain function of VCA 301.<br>
Figure 5 shows an electrical schematic diagram for implementing variable compressor 109 in<br>
accordance with Figure 3. In the illustrative implementation, integrated circuit 501 and<br>
integrated circuit 510 are THAT2181 and THAT2252, respectively. Both integrated circuits are<br>
manufactured by THAT Corporation. (Product specifications are available on the Internet at<br>
www.thatcorp.com.) Alternatively, THAT4311 RMS detector may be substituted for<br>
THAT2252 as integrated circuit 510. Input 300 is connected to pin 502 (in) and pin 503 (out) is<br>
connected to operational amplifier 507. Operational amplifier 507 and resistor 508 correspond<br>
to amplifier 303 in Figure 3. Pin 504 (EC-) is connected to the feedback loop comprising<br>
amplifier 311, compressor ratio and threshold circuit 309, and RMS detector 307. Pin 505<br>
(TRIM) is connected to 315. Pin 506 (EC+) is grounded.<br>
The output of operational amplifier 507 corresponds to output 316, which is the output of<br>
variable compressor 109. Moreover, output 316 is processed by RMS detector 307, which<br>
comprises integrated circuit 510, resistor 509, resistor 515, and capacitor 516. Resistor 509 is<br>
connected to pin 511 (in) of integrated circuit 510. Resistor 515, which is connected to pin 513<br>
(It), and capacitor 516, which is connected to pin 514 (CT), allow for tuning the time constant<br>
of integrated circuit 510. Pin 512 (out) is connected to the input of compressor ratio and<br>
threshold circuit 309, which comprises resistors 518, 519, 521, and 523, operational amplifier<br>
517, and diode 522. The compression threshold is determined by the corresponding DC offset<br>
as adjusted by resistors 518, resistor 519, and voltage source 520 (-Vee)- The compression ratio<br>
is determined by the gain of operational amplifier 517.<br>
The output of compressor ratio and threshold circuit 309 is processed by amplifier 311, which<br>
comprises operational amplifier 524, resistor 525, and resistor 526. The output of amplifier 311<br>
is connected to pin 504 (EC-) in order to control the voltage gain of integrated circuit 501.<br>
The distortion of the output of integrated circuit 501 is reduced by adjusting the voltage level<br>
presented to pin 505 (TRIM) by trim circuit 315. Trim circuit 315 comprises resistor 528 and<br>
529. The resistor configuration acts as a voltage divider that is coupled with voltage sources<br>
520 (-VEE) and 527 (+VCc).<br>
Figure 6 shows an electrical schematic diagram for implementing variable expander 125 in<br>
accordance with Figure 4. in the illustrative implementation, integrated circuit 602 and<br>
integrated circuit 609 are THAT2181 and THAT2252, respectively. Alternatively, THAT4311<br>
RMS detector may be substituted for THAT2252 as integrated circuit 609. Input 400 is<br>
connected to pin 603 (in) of integrated circuit 602 through resistor 601. Pin 604 (out) is<br>
connected to output 402 of variable expander 125.<br>
A control loop, comprising RMS detector 407, expansion ratio and threshold circuit 405, and<br>
amplifier 403 is configured between input 400 and pin 605 (EC+) of integrated circuit 602. Pin<br>
606 (TRIM) is connected to trim circuit 625, and pin 607 (EC-) is grounded.<br>
RMS detector 407 comprises resistor 608, integrated circuit 609, resistor 614, and capacitor<br>
615. Resistor 614, which is connected to pin 612 (It), and capacitor 615, which is connected to<br>
pin 613 (Ct) allows for tuning the time constant of integrated circuit 609. Pin 611 (out) is<br>
connected to the input of expansion ratio and threshold circuit 405, which comprises resistors<br>
616, 618, 619, and 622, operational amplifier 617, and diode 521. The expander threshold is<br>
determined by the corresponding DC offset as adjusted by resistors 618, resistor 619, and<br>
voltage source 620 (-VEE). The expansion ratio is determined by the gain of operational<br>
amplifier 620.<br>
The output of expansion ratio and threshold circuit 405 is processed by amplifier 403, which<br>
comprises operational amplifier 623, resistor 624, and resistor 626 through voltage source 625<br>
(+Vcc)- The output of amplifier 403 is connected to pin 605 (EC+) in order to control the<br>
voltage gain of integrated circuit 602.<br>
The distortion of the output of integrated circuit 602 is reduced by adjusting the voltage level<br>
presented to pin 606 (TRIM) by trim circuit 411. Trim circuit 411 comprises resistor 627 and<br>
628. The resistor configuration acts as a voltage divider that is coupled with voltage sources<br>
620 (-V,:,:) and 625 (+VCC).<br>
