PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be  performed : -<br><br>
The invention relates to a solution for damping of vibrations and structure borne noise, which occurs at vehicle bridges upon the same being traversed by vehicles. It refers preferably to damping of vibrations and structure borne noise at railway bridges, without, however, restricting itself to this. Since the term vibrations basically also cover the structure borne noise, the following representations refer to damping behavior of abridge developed on the basis of invention even then, when it is merely about vibrations, it always refers also to the structure borne noise.<br>
In the environment of railway track systems and here especially at bridges, while these tracks being traversed with rolling stocks a considerable vibration and noise load occurs due to vibrations and structure borne noise transmitted through the rail structure on to the ground below. Herein the increased vibration load at bridges among others is also caused by their suspension. Bridges, and so also railway bridges, according to the state of technology are normally suspended by means of elastomer bearings. The actual task of the bridge bearings is contained in enabling horizontal movements of bridge railway track, like these occur as a result of temperature fluctuations. The elastomer bearings provided on the bridges for this purpose characterize themselves by the fact that horizontally these are highly elastic. On the other hand, however, these have in vertical direction - due to structural constraints - a high level of stiffness. Due to the high vertical stiffness, however, elastomer bearings are not suitable for insulating vibrations transmitted by the vehicles on the bridge track. The vibrations, on the contrary, due to high stiffness of bearings are transmitted almost entirely un-dampened through the load bearing structure and the support structure on to the base or to the foundation and, depending on frequency, partially even clearly amplified. The structure borne noise generated in this manner is sensitively felt in the environment of bridges as noise pollution.<br>
Especially in suburban centers and cities, therefore, - not only as environmental policy initiative - special measures for dampening the vibrations and the structure borne noise at bridges must be taken. According to the state of technology there are<br><br><br>
measures of this kind, especially, for railway bridges, to dampen the vibrations from the travel path, that means in this case those from the railway tracks transmitted on to the bridge and thus also the structure borne noise. For this purpose, for example, railway tracks are suspended on vertically elastic bearings or are supported through spring-mass systems. An example for the elastic suspension of railway tracks on the ground - also deployed in the area of bridges - is the so-called „Colonge Egg". Other measures are related to laying the tracks in trough-like structures made of vibration and noise dampening materials, like this, is revealed, for example, through the DE 196 28 529 A 1 or the EP 0771 908 Bl, or, is described in the DE 37 37 567 A 1, at least to laying noise absorbing mats between tracks and, if necessary, besides these. Though, this definitely leads to considerable vibration reduction and/or noise absorption, however, this involves a very complex and expensive track support structure. But all the same these or comparable measures are necessary. Especially in the area of bridges the measures known so far, however, have negative impact on the per kilometer costs, since the travel path here is suspended as multi-elastic arrangement - namely in the area of bridge bearing and secondly between railway track and bridge support structure or bridge support framework.<br>
Therefore, the task of the invention is to provide a solution, which enable effective dampening of vibrations and structure borne noise on bridges and while doing so to reduce construction effort and cost vis-a-vis solutions known so far.<br>
The task is resolved through a vehicle bridge with the features of the main claim. Advantageous developments or further developments of the invention are given through the sub-claims.<br>
According to the invention the set task is resolved by the fact that the vehicle bridge - consisting mainly of a support structure, bridge piers, bridge bearings and a support frame - has modified bridge bearing, which are developed in the form of one or more horizontal as well as vertical elastic steel springs. These bridge bearings function   like   traditionally   designed   bridge   bearings   elastic   against   horizontal<br><br><br>
movements and shifts of the bridge carrier frame, further these dampen by virtue of their vertical elasticity, however at the same time the vibrations including structure borne noise occurring while the bridge is being traversed and to a major extent getting transmitted on to the support structure.<br>
The idea of invention lies in using bridge bearings while constructing bridges, especially bridges for the vehicular traffic, which have besides required high horizontal elasticity to take care of temperature dependent deformations of the bridge also a high vertical elasticity. Surprisingly it has revealed itself that steel springs made of hot formed spring steel, that have a high vertical elasticity, are also well suited for implementation of bridge bearings. That means, with the suitable designing, also have a sufficiently high horizontal elasticity for the use as bridge bearing. Through the deployment of steel springs for bridge suspension it is possible, instead of multi-elastic suspension otherwise necessary for meeting both the requirements (enabling horizontal movements of the bridge carrier frame on the one hand and vibration reduction or noise dampening on the other hand) to meet the requirements of dampening vibrations and structure borne noise through an exclusive single elastic suspension of bridge carrier frame.<br>
In trials and models screw type compression springs have proved themselves to be particularly suitable for the development of accordingly modified bridge bearing. Form and dimensioning of screw type compression springs used for implementation of single elastic suspension depend naturally on the respective case of deployment. However, it has shown itself that these springs should have a wire diameter of more than 5 mm and a spring diameter of over 50 mm with more than 4 windings. Besides usual cylindrical screw type compression springs, for this purpose, also barrel springs, funnel springs, conical wire springs or springs of similar geometrical form can be used.<br>
The invention based task, as emphasized earlier, is resolved preferably through the use of screw type compression springs. Basically, it is also possible to use leaf<br><br><br>
springs, torsion springs or other springs made of steel, as far as these are so developed that these have the required horizontal as well as vertical elasticity. The invention principle of modification of bridge bearings and their development through steel springs is naturally deployable for bridges of all kind, however, it is advantageous, according to the title of the invention, in view of occurrence of sizeable vibrations particularly in case of vehicle bridges.<br>
The invention should be explained once again in the following on the basis of a execution example. The relevant drawings show<br>
Fig. 1: a section of a bridge developed according to the invention in a schematic representation<br>
Fig. 2: Schematic representation of screw type compression spring used for the solution of the task in a section view with a length-wise cut carried by the spring.<br>
The Fig. 1 shows a section of a vehicle bridge designed according to the invention with its major elements in a schematic representation. In the figure a bridge pier 1 has been shown, on which rest parts of the supporting framework 3, 3' of the bridge. The bridge pier 1 itself rests on a support structure not shown here. The parts of the supporting framework 3, 3' shown in the figure rest themselves, in the known method, through bridge bearing 2, 2', on the bridge pier 1. Above the support framework 3, 31 the super structures 6 have been arranged for the travel paths, which are for example railway tracks, which are limited on both sides of the travel stretch through a railing or through a view screen.<br>
The bridge bearings 2, 2 have, as is known, a horizontal elasticity, through which horizontal movements of bridge track or that of carrier framework 3,3' are enabled, which occur especially as a result of temperature changes. In deference to the known state of technology, however,  the bridge bearings  2,  2'  are not elastomer<br><br><br>
bearing. The bridge bearings according to the invention are rather developed through several - as shown in the example - cylindrical screw type compression springs 4. 4', 5, 5' which also have high vertical elasticity besides required horizontal elasticity. Through the vertical elasticity of bridge bearings 2, 2' modified in this manner the vibrations caused while the bridge being traversed, including structure borne noise, which are conducted through the carrier framework 3, 3' and the bridge piers 1 in the foundation, are dampened in advantageous manner. Therefore, it is not necessary, to arrange in the area between the carrier framework 3, 31 and the track setup special means for dampening vibrations and structure borne noise. In place of multi—elastic suspension, with bridge bearings for enabling horizontal movements on the one hand and with special bearings (for example "Cologne Egg" for railway tracks) for dampening vibrations and structure borne noise on the other hand, thus occurs the exclusive suspension through the bridge bearings 2, 2' modified vis-a-vis the state of technology. Hereby the construction effort gets reduced and as a result also the costs for the bridge construction.<br>
In the example shown in the Fig. 1, like already mentioned and hinted at in the schematic representation, screw type compression springs 4, 41, 5, 5' are deployed as bridge bearing 2. 21. The Fig. 2 shows the schematic representation of a screw type compression spring 4 used suitably for resolving the task as part of a bridge bearing 2, 2'. It is a screw type compression spring 4 made form hot formed spring steel, in the example, 10 windings. The bridge bearings 2, 2' according to Fig. 1, as can be seen, consist of a group of relevant screw type compression springs 4, 4',5,5'. Such a spring 4 has a high vertical elasticity. Due to this vertical elasticity, the spring 4 while being used as bridge bearing 2, 2' causes dampening effect with respect to vibrations and structure borne noise, which are caused by vehicles traveling over the bridge. Through the dimensioning with the suitable number of windings and material thickness or wire diameter d of at least 5 mm a spring height of Lo, which reduces, as is apparent from the figure, under load by z to the spring height and horizontal elasticity of spring 4 acts, through which, comparable with the elastomer bearings used so far, also a horizontal movement of the bridge carrier framework is enabled.<br><br><br>
The respective forces acting on the spring 4 are shown in the figure, wherein the vertical acting force Fz emphasizes that force, which is brought about by the vehicles while passing the bridge and is linked through transmission of vibrations and structure borne noise to the ground. As against this, the force Y\ is the horizontal force, like it acts, for example, through temperature fluctuations on the bridge bearing 2,2'. x means herein the spring excursion caused through force across to the spring axis.<br><br><br>
