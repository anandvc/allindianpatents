				<td>PILOT SIGNAL TRANSMISSION METHOD AND APPARATUS<br>
FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates generally to pilot signal<br>
transmission, and in particular to a method and apparatus for pilot<br>
signal transmission in a communication system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
[0002]	A pilot signal (or reference signal) is commonly used for<br>
coirununication systems to enable a receiver to perform a number of<br>
critical functions, including but not limited to, the acquisition and<br>
tracking of timing and frequency synchronization, the estimation and<br>
tracking of desired channels for subsequent demodulation and<br>
decoding of the information data, the estimation and monitoring of the<br>
characteristics of other channels for handoff, interference suppression,<br>
etc. Several pilot schemes can be utilized by communication systems,<br>
and typically comprise the transmission of a known sequence at known<br>
time intervals. A receiver, knowing the sequence only or knowing the<br>
sequence and time interval in advance, utilizes this information to<br>
perform the abovementioned functions.<br>
[0003]	For the uplink of future broadband systems, single-carrier<br>
based approaches with orthogonal frequency division are of interest.<br>
These approaches, particularly Interleaved Frequency Division Multiple<br>
Access (IFDMA) and its frequency-domain related variant known as<br><br>
DFT-Spread-OFDM (DFT-SOFDM), are attractive because of their low<br>
peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), frequency domain orthogonality<br>
between users, and low-complexity frequency domain equalization.<br>
[0004]	In order to retain the low PAPR property of EFDMA/DFT-<br>
SOFDM, only a single IFDMA code should be transmitted by each user.<br>
This leads to restrictions on the pilot symbol format. In particular, a<br>
time division multiplexed (TDM) pilot block should be used, where<br>
data and pilots of a particular user are not mixed within the same<br>
IFDMA block. This allows the low PAPR property to be preserved and<br>
also enables the pilot to remain orthogonal from the data in multi-path<br>
channels, since there is conventionally a cyclic prefix between blocks.<br>
An example is shown in FIG. 1, where an IFDMA pilot block and<br>
subsequent IFDMA data blocks for a transmission frame or burst are<br>
shown.<br>
[0005]	While the TDM pilot approach is attractive, there are a<br>
limited number of separable or orthogonal pilot signals available for<br>
use by different transmitters in the system. Therefore a need exists for a<br>
method and apparatus for pilot signal transmission that increases the<br>
number of separable pilot signals.<br>
[0006]	The various aspects, features and advantages of the<br>
disclosure will become more fully apparent to those having ordinary<br>
skill in the art upon careful consideration of the following Detailed<br>
Description thereof with the accompanying drawings described below.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0020]	To address the above-mentioned need, a method and<br>
apparatus for pilot or reference signal transmission is disclosed herein.<br>
In particular, a pilot (or reference) transmission scheme is utilized<br>
where different transmitters are assigned pilot sequences with possibly<br>
different cyclic time shifts. A pilot signal is transmitted concurrently by<br>
the transmitters in a plurality of pilot blocks, and a receiver processes<br>
the plurality of received pilot blocks to recover a channel estimate for at<br><br>
least one of the transmitters while suppressing the interference due to<br>
the pilot signals from the other transmitters.<br>
[0021]	Turning now to the drawings, where like numerals<br>
designate like components, FIG. 2 is a block diagram of communication<br>
system 200 that utilizes pilot transmissions. Communication system 200<br>
preferably utilizes either OFDMA or a next generation single-carrier<br>
based FDMA architecture for uplink transmissions 206, such as<br>
interleaved FDMA (IFDMA), Localized FDMA (LFDMA), DFT-spread<br>
OFDM (DFT-SOFDM) with IFDMA or LFDMA. While these can be<br>
classified as single-carrier based transmission schemes with a much<br>
lower peak-to average power ratio than OFDM, they can also be<br>
classified as multicarrier schemes in the present invention because they<br>
are block-oriented like OFDM and can be configured to occupy only a<br>
certain set of "subcarriers" in the frequency domain like OFDM. Thus<br>
IFDMA and DFT-SOFDM can be classified as both single-carrier and<br>
multicarrier since they have single carrier characteristics in the time<br>
domain and multicarrier characteristics in the frequency domain. On<br>
top of the baseline transmission scheme, the architecture may also<br>
include the use of spreading techniques such as direct-sequence CDMA<br>
(DS-CDMA), multi-carrier CDMA (MC-CDMA), multi-carrier direct<br>
sequence CDMA (MC-DS-CDMA), Orthogonal Frequency and Code<br>
Division Multiplexing (OFCDM) with one or two dimensional<br>
spreading, or simpler time and/or frequency division<br>
multiplexing/rrtultiple access techniques, or a combination of these<br>
various techniques.<br><br>
[0022]	As one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize, even<br>
though EFDMA and DFT-SOFDM can be seen as single-carrier-based<br>
schemes, during operation of an EFDMA system or a DFT-SOFDM<br>
system, multiple subcarriers (e.g., 768 subcarriers) are utilized to<br>
transmit data. This is illustrated in FIG. 3. As shown, in FIG. 3 the<br>
"wideband channel is divided into many narrow frequency bands<br>
(subcarriers) 301, with data being transmitted in parallel on subcarriers<br>
301. However, a difference between OFDMA and IFDMA/DFT-SOFDM<br>
is that in OFDMA each data symbol is mapped to a particular<br>
subcarrier, whilst in IFDMA/DFT-SOFDM a portion of each data<br>
symbol is present on every occupied subcarrier (the set of occupied<br>
subcarriers for a particular transmission may be a either a subset or all<br>
of the subcarriers). Hence in IFDMA/DFT-SOFDM, each occupied<br>
subcarrier contains a mixture of multiple data symbols.<br>
[0023]	Returning to FIG. 2, communication system 200 includes<br>
one or more base units 201 and 202, and one or more remote units 203<br>
and 210. A base unit comprises one or more transmitters and one or<br>
more receivers that serve a number of remote units within a sector. The<br>
number of transmitters may be related, for example, to the number of<br>
transmit antennas at the base unit. A base unit may also be referred to<br>
as an access point, access terminal, Node-B, or similar terminologies<br>
from the art. A remote unit comprises one or more transmitters and one<br>
or more receivers. The number of transmitters may be related, for<br>
example, to the number of transmit antennas at the remote unit. A<br>
remote unit may also be referred to as a subscriber unit, a mobile unit,<br>
user equipment, a user, a terminal, a subscriber station, a user<br><br>
equipment, a user terminal or similar terminologies from the art. As<br>
known in the art, the entire physical area served by the communication<br>
network may be divided into cells, and each cell may comprise one or<br>
more sectors. When multiple antennas 209 are used to serve each sector<br>
to provide various advanced communication modes (e.g., adaptive<br>
bearnforming, transmit diversity, transmit SDMA, and multiple stream<br>
transmission, etc.), multiple base units can be deployed. These base<br>
units within a sector may be highly integrated and may share various<br>
hardware and software components. For example, all base units co-<br>
located together to serve a cell can constitute what is traditionally<br>
known as a base station. Base units 201 and 202 transmit downlink<br>
communication signals 204 and 205 to serving remote units on at least a<br>
portion of the same resources (time, frequency, or both). Remote units<br>
203 and 210 communicate with one or more base units 201 and 202 via<br>
uplink communication signals 206 and 213.<br>
[0024]	It should be noted that while only two base units and two<br>
remote units are illustrated in FIG. 2, one of ordinary skill in the art will<br>
recognize that typical communication systems comprise many base<br>
units in simultaneous communication with many remote units. It<br>
should also be noted that while the present invention is described<br>
primarily for the case of uplink transmission from a mobile unit to a<br>
base station, the invention is also applicable to downlink transmissions<br>
from base stations to mobile units, or even for transmissions from one<br>
base station to another base station, or from one mobile unit to another.<br>
A base unit or a remote unit may be referred to more generally as a<br>
communication unit.<br><br>
[0025]	As discussed above, pilot assisted modulation is commonly<br>
used to aid in many functions such as channel estimation for<br>
subsequent demodulation of transmitted signals. With this in mind,<br>
mobile unit 203 transmits known (pilot) sequences at known time<br>
intervals as part of their uplink transmissions. Any base station,<br>
knowing the sequence and time interval, utilizes this information in<br>
demodulating/decoding the transmissions. Thus, each mobile/remote<br>
unit within communication system 200 comprises pilot channel<br>
circuitry 207 that transmits one or more pilot sequences along with data<br>
channel circuitry 208 transmitting data.<br>
[0026]	For pilot signal transmission, a TDM pilot approach is<br>
attractive for PAPR and for providing orthogonality between the pilot<br>
and data streams. However, in some systems it may limit the<br>
granularity available for adjusting the pilot overhead. In one<br>
embodiment, a shorter block duration is used for the pilot block than<br>
for the data block in order to provide a finer granularity for the choice<br>
of pilot overhead. In other embodiments, the pilot block may have the<br>
same duration as a data block, or the pilot block may have a longer<br>
duration than a data block.<br>
[0027]	As a consequence of using a shorter block length for pilot<br>
blocks than data blocks, the subcarrier bandwidth and the occupied<br>
subcarrier spacing for the pilot block becomes larger than the subcarrier<br>
bandwidth and the occupied subcarrier spacing for the data block,<br>
assuming the same IFDMA repetition factor (or occupied subcarrier<br><br>
declination factor) is used for both the pilot block and the data block. In<br>
this case, if the pilot block length (excluding cyclic prefix) is Tp and the<br>
data block length (excluding cyclic prefix) is Td, the subcarrier<br>
bandwidth and the occupied subcarrier spacing for the pilot block is<br>
Td/Tp times the subcarrier bandwidth and the occupied subcarrier<br>
spacing for the data block, respectively.<br>
[0028]	Pilot transmissions may occur simultaneously by two or<br>
more transmitters, such as mobile unit 203 and mobile unit 210, or by<br>
two or more antennas of mobile unit 210. It is advantageous to design<br>
the pilot sequences transmitted by different transmitters to be<br>
orthogonal or otherwise separable to enable accurate channel estimation<br>
by a receiver, such as base unit 201, to each transmitter (note that the<br>
role of the base units and mobile units may also be reversed, wherein<br>
the base units or antennas of a base unit are transmitters and the mobile<br>
unit or units are receivers).<br>
[0029]	One method of providing separability between the pilots or<br>
channel estimates of two or more transmitters is to assign different sets<br>
of subcarriers to different transmitters for the pilot transmissions, also<br>
referred to as FDMA pilot assignment. The different sets of subcarriers<br>
could be interleaved among transmitters or could be on different blocks<br>
of subcarriers, and may or may not be confined to a small portion of the<br>
channel bandwidth of the system.<br>
[0030]	Another method of providing separability between the<br>
pilots or channel estimates of multiple transmitters is to assign two or<br><br>
more transmitters to a same set of subcarriers for pilot transmission and<br>
utilize sequence properties to provide the separability. Note that<br>
FDMA pilot assignments and the utilization of sequence properties can<br>
both be applied to a system. For example, a first set of transmitters may<br>
use a first set of subcarriers, with each transmitter in the set<br>
transmitting its pilot signal on possibly all of the subcarriers of the first<br>
set of subcarriers. A second set of transmitters may use a second set of<br>
subcarriers for pilot transmission, where the second set of subcarriers is<br>
orthogonal to the first set of subcarriers (FDMA). Note that the<br>
members of a set of subcarriers do not need to be adjacent. Since the<br>
transmitters in a set may interfere with each other as they use the same<br>
set of subcarriers for pilot signal transmission, the pilot sequences of the<br>
transmitters in the same set should have sequence properties that<br>
enable the channel response to be estimated to one of the transmitters<br>
while suppressing the interference from the other transmitters in the<br>
same set. The present invention provides a method and apparatus for<br>
suppressing such interference.<br>
[0031]	The present invention enables a larger number of<br>
transmitters to transmit pilot signals simultaneously while providing<br>
for separability of the pilots or channel estimates at a receiver. Multiple<br>
transmitters transmit pilots on a first set of subcarriers during a first<br>
interval (e.g., a first pilot block), and the multiple transmitters transmit<br>
pilots on a second set of subcarriers during a second interval (e.g., a<br>
second pilot block). The number of intervals or pilot blocks may also be<br>
larger than two. The pilot sequence properties are chosen for the<br>
plurality of intervals to provide channel estimate separability over the<br><br>
plurality of intervals, even though the channel estimates may not be<br>
separable if only a single interval was considered.<br>
[0032]	A burst format suitable for use with one embodiment the<br>
invention is shown in FIG. 4. In FIG. 4, Td is the duration of a data block<br>
and the duration of the pilot block is Tp = Td/2. One way to specify the<br>
subcarriers assigned to or used by a signal is to specify the block length<br>
B, the repetition factor R (or the subcarrier decimation factor or skip<br>
factor), and the subcarrier offset index S. The parameters are similar to a<br>
B-subcarrier OFDM modulator, with subcarrier mapping of evenly-<br>
spaced subcarriers with spacing of R subcarriers with a subcarrier offset<br>
of S, for an DFT-SOFDM signal. These can be written as an ordered<br>
triplet: (B, R, S). In the example, the data blocks are configured as (Td,<br>
Rd, Sd). The first pilot block is configured as (Tp, Rp, Sp1) and the<br>
second pilot is configured as (Tp, Rp, Sp2). The cyclic prefix (CP) length<br>
is Tcp. Note that the block length, repetition factor, and subcarrier offset<br>
can in general be different for pilot blocks and data blocks, or can be<br>
changed over time for data blocks or pilot blocks.<br>
[0033]	While FIG. 4 shows the time domain format of the burst,<br>
the frequency domain description over time is shown in FIG. 5. For<br>
simplicity, FIG. 5 shows pilot and data transmission for only two<br>
transmitters, with the transmissions by each transmitter being shaded.<br>
In FIG. 5A, the data blocks of the first transmitter are configured as<br>
(Td=40, Rd=8, Sd=3), the data blocks of the second transmitter are<br>
configured as (Td=40, Rd=4, Sd=0), the first pilot block (pilot set 1) is<br>
configured as (Tp=20, Rp=2, Sp=0) for both transmitters, and the second<br><br>
pilot block (pilot set 2) is configured as (Tp=20, Rp=2, Sp=0) for both<br>
transmitters. In FIG. 5B, the data blocks for the first and second<br>
transmitter are configured similarly to FIG. 5A, while both the first and<br>
second pilot blocks are configured as (Tp=20, Rp=1, Sp=0), thus<br>
providing pilot information on directly adjacent subcarriers of the pilot<br>
block. As one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize, transmissions<br>
by a particular transmitter (e.g., transmitter 1 in FIG. 5) will occupy<br>
several subcarriers, as indicated by the shaded subcarriers 503 (only one<br>
labeled) out of all the subcarriers 501 (only one labeled). FIG. 5 is<br>
illustrated having total possible data block subcarriers 0 through 39.<br>
Note that the data block configuration (Td, Rd, Sd) for a transmitter<br>
could be different on different data blocks within the burst. Also, the<br>
pilot block configuration could be different on different pilot blocks in<br>
the burst. While the example given in FIG. 5 is for IFDMA of the data<br>
transmissions from different transmitters, note that LFDMA can also be<br>
represented by setting Rd=1, Td
occupied subcarrier of the transmitter's data transmission.<br>
[0034]	Because the pilot channel block duration is less than the<br>
data channel block duration in the burst format of FIG. 4, each pilot<br>
subcarrier 502 (only one labeled) takes up more bandwidth than does a<br>
data subcarrier. For example, in FIG. 5, a pilot subcarrier takes up twice<br>
as much bandwidth as a data subcarrier. Thus, fewer pilot subcarriers<br>
can be transmitted within the available bandwidth than can data<br>
subcarriers. FIG. 5 is illustrated having the total possible pilot<br>
subcarriers 0 through 19, with both transmitters occupying the shaded<br>
pilot subcarriers (the remaining unshaded data and pilot subcarriers<br>
can be utilized by other transmitters).<br><br>
[0035]	In one embodiment of the invention, cyclic time shifts of<br>
one or more pilot sequences are transmitted by mobile unit 203 and<br>
mobile unit 210 in the first pilot block and in the second pilot block of<br>
FIG. 5. A cyclic time shift of a pilot sequence can be implemented, for<br>
example, by moving a block of time domain samples of the pilot block<br>
from the end of the pilot block to the beginning of the pilot block. Then<br>
the cyclic prefix of the pilot block is based on the samples of the pilot<br>
block after the cyclic shift has been applied. The number of samples that<br>
are moved from the end of the block to the beginning of the block is the<br>
amount of the cyclic shift in the block. For the purpose of illustration, if<br>
there are six time domain samples in a particular pilot block and they<br>
are, in time order from first to last, x(l), x(2), x(3), x(4), x(5), x(6), then a<br>
cyclic time shift of three samples would result in a pilot block with the<br>
samples, in time order from first to last, of x(4), x(5), x(6), x(l), x(2), x(3).<br>
And if the cyclic prefix for the pilot block was two samples, the cyclic<br>
prefix samples of the cyclically shifted pilot block would be, from first<br>
to last, x(2), x(3). As will be described later, there are additional<br>
methods for providing a cyclic time shift that are equivalent to the one<br>
described above.<br>
[0036]	When multiple transmitters are transmitting pilot blocks<br>
simultaneously on the same set of subcarriers, different transmitters can<br>
use different cyclic time shifts of the same pilot sequence to enable a<br>
receiver to estimate the channel between the receiver and each of the<br>
transmitters. For the purpose of illustration, assume that the first<br>
transmitter is using a first pilot sequence that has constant magnitude,<br><br>
when viewed in the frequency domain, on the subcarriers used by the<br>
pilot block. Also assume the pilot block length is Tp and the cyclic<br>
prefix length is Tcp. If the channel impulse response duration is less<br>
than Tcp and the pilot block has Rp=1 (as shown in FIG. 513), then it can<br>
be shown that up to Tp/Tcp different transmitters can transmit in the<br>
same pilot block, with different cyclic shift values, and the channel<br>
estimates will be separable (or nearly orthogonal) at the receiver. For<br>
example, if Tp/Tcp = 4 and there are 4 transmitters, then a first<br>
transmitter can use a cyclic time shift of 0, a second transmitter can use<br>
a cyclic time shift of Tp/4, a third transmitter can use a cyclic time shift<br>
of Tp/2, and a third transmitter can use a cyclic time shift of 3Tp/4. In<br>
equation form, a frequency-domain representation of a pilot sequence<br>
for the transmitter on subcarrier k and block b for the case of Rp=1<br>
can be represented as: where s(k,b) is the baseline<br>
or un-shifted pilot sequence (e.g., a constant modulus signal such as<br>
QPSK, a CAZAC sequence, a GCL sequence, or the DFT/IDFT of a<br>
CAZAC or GCL sequence), ae is the cyclic time shift for transmitter l<br>
(for the example above α1=0, α2=Tp/4, α3=Tp/2, and α4=3Tp/4), and P<br>
is a cyclic shift factor (P=Tp in the above example). Note that the pilot<br>
sequence can be implemented in the time domain by performing a<br>
circular shift of S(n,b) which is the IFFT of s(k,b) (for the above example,<br>
transmitter 1 would send an unshifted version of S(n,b), transmitter 2<br>
would send S(n,b) circularly shifted by Tp/4 samples, transmitter 3<br>
would send S(n,b) circularly shifted by Tp/2 samples, and transmitter 4<br>
would send S(n,b) circularly shifted by 3Tp/4 samples).<br><br>
[0037]	Note also that the equation representation of the frequency-<br>
domain pilot sequence given above is easily extended to the case where<br>
Rp≠1. In this case the pilot sequence is only defined on certain<br>
subcarriers and the subcarrier offset, S, must be added to the pilot<br>
sequence equation as follows (note that in the next equation Tp=Tp and<br>
  Note<br>
that the values of αt and P may need to change based on the value of<br>
Rp. Also note that all subsequent equation representations of the pilot<br>
sequence "will be given for Rp=1 but can be extended to Rp≠1 in a<br>
similar manner to what was just presented.<br>
[0038]	At the receiver, when the receiver correlates the original<br>
pilot sequence with the composite received pilot block from, the four<br>
transmitters, the channel response to the first transmitter will be in a<br>
first block of Tp/4 correlator output samples, as shown in FIG. 6 602,<br>
the channel response to the second transmitter will be in the next block<br>
of Tp/4 correlator output samples, as shown in FIG. 6 604, and so forth,<br>
as shown in FIG. 6 606 and 608. (Note that the correlator-based channel<br>
estimator is only used as an example and other channel estimation<br>
techniques known in the art might be used such as DFT-based channel<br>
estimator and MMSE-based channel estimators.)<br>
[0039]	Note that in this example, the time shift increment of Tp/4<br>
was chosen to be the same as the cyclic prefix (CP) duration (Tcp -<br>
Tp/4). It is often advantageous to make the time shift increment similar<br>
to the CP length if the pilot block has Rp=l because the CP is normally<br>
chosen to be as large as the maximum expected multipath channel<br><br>
delay spread in the system 200 of FIG. 2. However, if Tcp is shorter<br>
than the expected duration of the channel, then the number of<br>
transmitters that can be separated at the receiver is Tp/L where L is the<br>
expected maximum length of the channel. In this case the time shift<br>
increment could be larger than the CP length and could be tied to the<br>
expected maximum channel length, L. When the time shift increment is<br>
at least as large as the multipath delay spread of the channel, then the<br>
channel responses for each transmitter will be confined to its respective<br>
correlator output block of length Tcp (note that practical issues such as<br>
conventional signal conditioning and filtering, sampling granularity,<br>
and so on will generally cause a small amount of leakage between the<br>
estimates of the channel response in one correlator output block and<br>
another, but in most cases of interest this leakage can be considered<br>
small and be ignored for the purpose of describing the invention).<br>
However, if the time delay increment between transmitters is less than<br>
the channel response duration, a portion of the channel response of one<br>
transmitter will appear in the channel response of another transmitter<br>
and -will interfere with the channel estimate of the other transmitter. As<br>
a result, in this example, if the channel response is no larger than the CP<br>
length and the time shift increment between transmitters equal to the<br>
CP length (with Tcp = Tp/4), a total of four transmitters can be<br>
supported while providing separable channel estimates to each<br>
transmitter.<br>
[0040]	In order to increase the number of transmitters that can be<br>
supported with separable channel estimates, the present invention<br>
provides a method for assigning pilot sequences to a plurality of<br><br>
transmitters over a plurality of pilot blocks, such that when processed<br>
over the plurality of pilot blocks at a receiver, the channel estimates<br>
become separable. In FIG. 6, one embodiment of the invention that<br>
provides a doubling of the number of transmitters that can be<br>
supported with separable channel estimates is illustrated. In one pilot<br>
block (denoted as SB#1 in FIG. 6), some of the transmitters in FIG. 6 are<br>
assigned cyclic shifts that are integer multiples of Tcp (multiples of 0,1,<br>
2, 3) and others are assigned cyclic shifts that are odd multiples of<br>
Tcp/2 (multiples 1, 3, 5, 7). For example, a first transmitter denoted as<br>
Tx#1 uses a first cyclic tune shift value of zero, and the time domain<br>
channel response for this transmitter is illustrated by the five arrows or<br>
rays within the time region from 0 to Tcp in the region 602 associated<br>
with transmitter Tx#1. A second transmitter, denoted as Tx#5 in FIG. 6,<br>
uses a second cyclic time shift value of Tcp/2. As a result, when the<br>
channel response length for transmitter Tx#1 is greater than Tcp/2, the<br>
channel response for transmitter Tx#1 will interfere with the channel<br>
response for transmitter Tx#5 in the region between Tcp/2 and Tcp,<br>
and vice versa, and the channel estimates are no longer separable<br>
without significant interference. In equation form, a frequency-domain<br>
pilot sequence for the lth transmitter on subcarrier k and block b1 (which<br>
is the location of this first pilot block) for the case of Rp=1 can be<br>
represented as: xi(k,b1) = s(k,bl)e-j2nkaeIP where s(k,b1) is a pilot sequence<br>
for the first pilot block (e.g., a constant modulus signal such as QPSK, a<br>
CAZAC sequence, a GCL sequence, or the DFT/IDFT of a CAZAC or<br>
GCL sequence), αℓ is the cyclic time shift for transmitter ℓ (for the<br>
example above α1=0, α2=Tcp, α3=2Tcp, α4=3Tcp, α5=Tcp/2, α6=3Tcp/2,<br>
α7=5Tcp/2, α8=7Tcp/2), and P is a cyclic shift factor (P=4Tcp in the<br><br>
above example). Note that as in the previous equation that these shifts<br>
can be applied in the time domain by circularly shifting the IFFT of<br>
s(k,b1), S(n,b1), by the appropriate amounts.<br>
[0041]	In order to provide separability with the larger number of<br>
transmitters, a second pilot block is transmitted by the transmitters.<br>
The channel responses associated with the transmitters for the second<br>
pilot block are illustrated in the lower half of FIG. 6 (SB#2). The pilot<br>
sequences of the transmitters are assigned in a way that allows the<br>
interference between the first transmitter and the second transmitter to<br>
be suppressed by combining the channel estimates from the first and<br>
second pilot blocks. In one embodiment, cyclic time shifts of a common<br>
pilot sequence are used in both the first and second pilot blocks, but the<br>
sign of the common pilot sequence is inverted in one of the pilot blocks<br>
for one or more transmitters. FIG. 6 shows that an embodiment where<br>
the sign of the pilot sequence is inverted during the second pilot block<br>
for transmitters using cyclic shifts that are odd multiples of Tcp/2. In<br>
equation form for this embodiment, a frequency domain representation <br>
of the pilot sequence for the ℓth transmitter on subcarrier k and block b2<br>
(which is the location of this second pilot block) for the case of Rp=1 is<br><br>
baseline or un-shifted pilot sequence for the second pilot block (e.g., a<br>
constant modulus signal such as QPSK, a CAZAC sequence, a GCL<br>
sequence, or the DFT/IDFT of a CAZAC or GCL sequence), αℓ is the<br>
cyclic time shift for transmitter ℓ (for the example above α1=0, α2=Tcp,<br>
α3=2Tcp, α4=3Tcp, α5=Tcp/2, α6=3Tcp/2, α7=5Tcp/2, α8=7Tcp/2), and<br><br>
P is a cyclic shift factor (P=4Tcp in the above example). Note that as in<br>
the previous equations that these shifts can be applied in the time<br>
domain by circularly shifting the IFFT of s(k,b2), S(n,b2), by the<br>
appropriate amounts. This allows the interference between transmitters<br>
with, odd multiples of Tcp/2 and transmitters with integer multiples of<br>
Tcp to be suppressed by combining over the received pilot blocks.<br>
Thus, the interference from transmitter Tx#5 on the channel estimate for<br>
Tx#1 can be suppressed adding the first received pilot block to the<br>
second received pilot block prior to performing channel estimation.<br>
Alternatively, a channel estimate derived for Tx#1 from the first pilot<br>
block can be added to a channel estimate derived for Tx#1 from the<br>
second pilot block to suppress the interference from Tx#5. Likewise,<br>
the interference from Tx#1 on Tx#8 can be suppressed by subtracting<br>
the second received pilot block from the first received pilot block prior<br>
to channel estimation, or the channel estimate obtained for Tx#8 in the<br>
second pilot block can be subtracted from the channel estimate obtained<br>
for Tx#8 in the first pilot block (this assumes that an inverted channel<br>
estimate is obtained for Tx#8 in the second pilot block by correlating<br>
with non-inverted common pilot sequence - however, if the inverted<br>
sequence is correlated with the second pilot block, then a non-inverted<br>
channel estimate would be obtained for Tx#8 and the estimates for<br>
Tx#8 from the first pilot block and the second pilot block would be<br>
added instead of subtracted).<br>
[0042]	Note that in the above description it was assumed that the<br>
second pilot block contained the negation. If the negation "were to be<br>
applied to the first pilot block and no negation applied to the second<br><br>
pilot block, then similar processing to that described above could be<br>
used but with the roles of the first and second pilot blocks being<br>
reversed.<br>
[0043]	In another embodiment, cyclic time shifts of a first common<br>
pilot sequence are assigned to the transmitters for the first pilot block<br>
and cyclic shifts of a second, different, common pilot sequence, that is<br>
also inverted for some transmitters (as in the previous embodiment), is<br>
assigned to the transmitters for the second pilot block. This<br>
embodiment may provide improved averaging over other-cell<br>
interference. In this embodiment, the channel estimates for the first<br>
pilot block can be obtained by correlating the first received pilot block<br>
with the first common sequence, and the channel estimates for the<br>
second pilot block can be obtained by correlating the second received<br>
pilot block with the second common sequence. The channel estimates<br>
for the first and second pilot blocks can be combined (e.g., added or<br>
subtracted, as appropriate) to suppress the corresponding interference.<br>
In equation form for this embodiment, a frequency domain<br>
representation of the pilot sequence for the ℓth transmitter on subcarrier<br>
k and symbol bm (which is the location of the mth pilot block) can be<br>
represented as (for Rp=1): <br>
is a baseline or un-shifted pilot sequence for the mth pilot block (e.g., a<br>
constant modulus signal), αℓ(bm) is the cyclic time shift for transmitter i<br>
for pilot block m, and P(bm) is a cyclic shift factor for pilot block m. Note<br>
that the cyclic shift could also be implemented in the time domain by<br>
circularly shifting the time-domain pilot signal by the appropriate<br>
amount.<br><br>
[0044]	In another embodiment, one set of transmitters is assigned<br>
cyclic shifts of a first common pilot sequence for both the first and<br>
second pilot blocks, and a second set of transmitters is assigned cyclic<br>
shifts of a second common pilot sequence for both the first and second<br>
pilot blocks, but the second common sequence is inverted in the second<br>
pilot block relative to the second common sequence in the first pilot<br>
block so that the received pilot blocks can be processed to suppress the<br>
interference between transmitters assigned the same cyclic time shift<br>
value. In equation form for this embodiment, a frequency-domain<br>
representation of the pilot sequence for the ℓth transmitter on subcarrier<br>
k and symbol bm (which is the location of the mth pilot block, m=0, 1) can<br><br>
"where L1 is the first set of transmitters, L2 is the second set of<br>
transmitters, s(k,bm) is a baseline or un-shifted pilot sequence for the first<br>
set of transmitters on pilot block m (e.g., a constant modulus signal),<br>
z(k,bm) is a baseline or un-shifted pilot sequence for the second set of<br>
transmitters on pilot block m (e.g., a constant modulus signal), aℓ is the<br>
cyclic time shift for transmitter ℓ, and P is a cyclic shift factor.<br>
[0045]	In another embodiment, the cyclic time shift assigned to<br>
ne transmitter can be the same as the cyclic time shift assigned to<br>
another transmitter (e.g., with 8 transmitters, two could be assigned a<br>
cyclic shift of 0, another two can be assigned a cyclic shift of Tcp, and so<br>
on). In this embodiment, cyclic time shifts of a common pilot sequence<br>
can be used by the transmitters in both the first and second pilot blocks,<br><br>
but the sign of the common pilot sequence is inverted in one of the pilot<br>
blocks for one set of transmitters so that the received pilot blocks can be<br>
processed to suppress the interference between transmitters assigned<br>
lite same cyclic time shift value. In another embodiment where the<br>
same cyclic time shift is assigned to multiple transmitters, one set of<br>
transmitters, each with a different cyclic shift value, is assigned a first<br>
pilot sequence, and a second set of transmitters, each with a different<br>
cyclic shift value, is assigned a second pilot sequence. The transmitters<br>
in the second set invert the pilot second pilot sequence in one of the<br>
pilot blocks so that the received pilot blocks can be processed to<br>
suppress the interference between transmitters assigned the same cyclic<br>
tune shift value.<br>
[0046]	For the convenience, the embodiments above have been<br>
described for the case where the pilot block has Rp=1 (e.g., FIG. 5B). In<br>
embodiments where lite pilot block transmission of a transmitter<br>
occupies a decimated set of subcarriers, such as an Rp=2 in FIG. 5A, the<br>
number of separable channel responses is reduced. The number of<br>
separable channel responses becomes (1/Rp) times the number of<br>
separable channel responses that were possible with Rp=1. For<br>
example, if FIG- 6 is for the case of Rp=1 on a pilot block, then for an<br>
embodiment similar to FIG. 6 but with Rp=2, there could be two<br>
transmitters in the first set, with cyclic shifts of 0 and Tcp respectively,<br>
and there could be two other transmitters in the second set, with cyclic<br>
shifts of Tcp/2 and 3Tcp/2 respectively.<br><br>
[0047]	For the convenience/ the embodiments of the invention are<br>
described for the case where there are two pilot blocks over which the<br>
channel response separability is obtained. However, the invention is<br>
also applicable when the number of pilot blocks is greater than two.<br>
For example, one embodiment with four pilot blocks would provide for<br>
twice as many separable channel responses as an embodiment with two<br>
pilot blocks. Building upon FIG. 6, there may be four sets of<br>
transmitters, each set using a possibly different set of cyclic shifts. For<br>
example, a third set of transmitters could be assigned cyclic shifts of<br>
Tcp/4, 5Tcp/4, 9Tcp/4, or 13Tcp/4, and a fourth set of transmitters<br>
could be assigned cyclic shifts of 3Tcp/4, 7Tcp/4, HTcp/4, or 15Tcp/4.<br>
For embodiments with more than two pilot blocks, the sequence<br>
inversion method described earlier is extended to the general case of<br>
orthogonal sets of multiplicative factors over the pilot blocks. For<br>
example, all transmitters can use cyclic shifts of a common pilot<br>
sequence, and the four pilot blocks of the first set of transmitters can be<br>
multiplied by a first set of block modulation coefficients such as the<br>
elements of a Walsh code or other orthogonal sequence of length four<br>
(the samples of the first pilot block are multiplied by the first element of<br>
the orthogonal code and so forth). The second set of transmitters would<br>
utilize a second orthogonal sequence in a similar fashion, and so forth.<br>
The receiver would combine weighted channel estimates from the four<br>
pilot blocks with the weighting coefficients based on the orthogonal<br>
sequences to recover certain channel estimates while suppressing<br>
others. (Note that in FIG. 6, the block modulation coefficients are (1,1)<br>
for transmitters in the first set and (1,-1) for the transmitters in the<br>
second set). The weighting coefficients can be based on the block<br><br>
modulation coefficients (such as the conjugates of the block modulation<br>
coefficients) or be adapted based on channel conditions to provide a<br>
compromise between tracking any variation of the channel response<br>
over the burst and suppression of the interfering pilot signals from<br>
other transmitters. In one embodiment, the weighting coefficients are<br>
based on the block modulation coefficients and the Doppler frequency<br>
or expected channel variation over the burst thereby providing a<br>
tradeoff between channel tracking and interference suppression. The<br>
weighting coefficients may also be different for different positions (e.g.,<br>
different data block positions) in the burst by selecting or determining a<br>
set of weighting coefficients to be used for processing the received pilot<br>
blocks at each position in the burst. The weighting coefficients can be<br>
based on an MMSE criteria. The processing may comprise<br>
filtering/interpolation based on the weighting coefficients. In cases<br>
where Rp is 2 or larger, the processing can be two-dimensional<br>
(frequency and time), or can be performed separately over frequency<br>
and then time, or for some channels with limited variation over the<br>
burst duration the two received pilot blocks can be treated as being<br>
received at the same time and a frequency interpolation/filtering can be<br>
performed on the composite of the occupied pilot subcarriers from the<br>
two received pilot blocks. In cases where the delay spread is less than<br>
the minimum increment between cyclic shifts (cyclic delays), the<br>
processing can be adapted to provide improved performance. In this<br>
case, the interference between transmitters will be suppressed within<br>
each pilot individually, so the processing can select or determine the<br>
weighting coefficients based on the expected amount of channel<br><br>
variation and noise instead of determining or selecting weights that are<br>
designed to suppress pilot interference over the multiple pilot blocks.<br>
[0048]	FIG. 7 is a block diagram of IFDMA transmitter 700<br>
performing time-domain signal generation. During operation incoming<br>
data bits are received by serial to parallel converter 701 and output as m<br>
bit streams to constellation mapping circuitry 703. Switch 707 serves to<br>
receive either a pilot signal (sub-block) from pilot signal generator 705,<br>
or a data signal (sub-block) from mapping circuitry 703 of sub-block<br>
length/ Bs. The length of the pilot sub-block may be smaller or larger<br>
than that of the data sub-block. As shown in FIG. 7B, pilot signal<br>
generator 705 may provide a cyclic time shift of a pilot sequence for the<br>
pilot sub-block. Regardless of whether pilot sub-block or data sub-block<br>
are received by sub-block repetition circuitry 709, circuitry 709 serves to<br>
perform sub-block repetition with repetition factor Rd on the sub-block<br>
passed from switch 707 to form a data block of block length B. Note that<br>
Rd=1 can also be used, when the signal is to occupy a contiguous set of<br>
subcarriers thus providing a single-carrier signal. Block length B is the<br>
product of the sub-block length Bs and repetition factor Rd and may be<br>
different for pilot and data blocks, as was shown in FIG. 4. The sub-<br>
block length Bs and repetition factor Rd may be different for the data<br>
and pilot. Data block and a modulation code 711 are fed to modulator<br>
710. Thus, modulator 710 receives a symbol stream (i.e., elements of<br>
data block) and a IFDMA modulation code (sometimes referred to as<br>
simply a modulation code). The output of modulator 710 comprises a<br>
signal existing at certain evenly-spaced frequencies, or subcarriers, the<br>
subcarriers having a specific bandwidth. The actual subcarriers that<br><br>
signal utilizes is dependent upon the repetition factor Rd of the sub-<br>
blocks and the particular modulation code utilized. The sub-block<br>
length Bs, repetition factor Rd, and modulation code can also be<br>
changed over time. Changing the modulation code changes the set of<br>
subcarriers, so changing the modulation code is equivalent to changing<br>
Sd. Varying the block length B, varies the specific bandwidth of each<br>
subcarrier, with larger block lengths having smaller subcarrier<br>
bandwidths. It should be noted, however, that while changing the<br>
modulation code will change the subcarriers utilized for transmission,<br>
the evenly-spaced nature of the subcarriers remain. Thus, subcarrier<br>
changing pilot pattern is achieved by changing the modulation code. In<br>
one embodiment of the present invention the modulation code is<br>
changed at least once per burst. In another embodiment, the<br>
modulation code is not changed in a burst. A cyclic prefix is added by<br>
circuitry 713 and pulse-shaping takes place via pulse-shaping circuitry<br>
715. The resulting signal is transmitted via transmission circuitry 717.<br>
[0049]	Transmitter 700 is operated so that transmission circuitry<br>
717 transmits a plurality of data symbols over a first plurality of<br>
subcarriers, each subcarrier within the first plurality of subcarriers has a<br>
first bandwidth. One example of this is the like shaded subcarriers<br>
between t1 and t2 in FIG. 5, the like shaded subcarriers between t3 and<br>
t4, and the shaded subcarriers beginning at t5. Transmission circuitry<br>
717 transmits a first pilot sequence at a first time for a user, the first<br>
pilot sequence is transmitted in a first pattern over a second plurality of<br>
subcarriers. Each subcarrier from the second plurality of subcarriers has<br>
a second bandwidth. One example of this with the second bandwidth<br><br>
being different than the first bandwidth is the shaded subcarriers in the<br>
column Pilot Block 1 of FIG. 5 (between t2 and t3). The second pilot<br>
sequence is transmitted for the user at a second time. The second pilot<br>
sequence is transmitted in a second pattern over a third plurality of<br>
subcarriers, each subcarrier from the third plurality of subcarriers<br>
having a third bandwidth. One example of this with the third<br>
bandwidth being the same as the second bandwidth is the shaded<br>
subcarriers in the column Pilot Block 2 of FIG. 5 (between t4 and t5).<br>
Note that although the cyclic shift of the pilot sequence is shown to take<br>
place at the pilot signal generator 705, in other embodiments the cyclic<br>
shift of the pilot block could be implemented in other places. For<br>
example, a cyclic time shift can be applied to the pilot block samples<br>
between application of the modulation code (710) and the addition of<br>
the cyclic prefix (713).<br>
[0050]	FIG. 8 is a block diagram of transmitter 800 (which will be<br>
designated as transmitter ℓ in the following equations) used to transmit<br>
pilots and data in the frequency domain using a DFT-SOFDM<br>
transmitter. Blocks 801, 802, and 806-809 are very similar to a<br>
conventional OFDM/OFDMA transmitter, while blocks 803 and 805 are<br>
unique to DFT-SOFDM. As with conventional OFDM, the IDFT size (or<br>
number of points, N) is typically larger than the maximum number of<br>
allowed non-zero inputs. More specifically, some inputs corresponding<br>
to frequencies beyond the edges of the channel bandwidth are set to<br>
zero, thus providing an oversampling function to simplify the<br>
implementation of the subsequent transmission circuitry, as is known in<br>
the art. As described earlier, different subcarrier bandwidths may be<br><br>
used on pilot blocks than on data blocks, corresponding to different<br>
pilot block and data block lengths. In the transmitter of FIG. 8, different<br>
subcarrier bandwidths can be provided by different IDFT sizes (N) for<br>
pilot blocks and data blocks. For example, a data block may have<br>
N=512, and the number of usable subcarriers within the channel<br>
bandwidth may be B=384. Then, an example of a pilot block having a<br>
larger subcarrier bandwidth (and more specifically, a subcarriex<br>
bandwidth twice as large as a data block) is obtained by using<br>
N=512/2=256 for the pilot block, with the number of usable pilot<br>
subcarriers then being B=384/2=192. (Note that the example in FIG. 5<br>
has a number of usable data subcarriers of 40, and a number of usable<br>
pilot subcarriers of 20.) The specific set of subcarriers out of the usable<br>
ones that are occupied by a data block or a pilot block are determined<br>
by the mapping block 805.<br>
[0051]	In the pilot signal generator block 810 the frequency-<br>
domain pilot symbols are generated and are fed to the symbol to<br>
subcarrier mapping block 805. As mentioned above, in one<br>
embodiment the frequency-domain pilot symbols for transmitter ℓ are<br>
given as (for Rp=1 and 0≤k≤Mp-1 and b denotes the symbol where the<br>
pilot symbols are located): xℓ(k,b) = s(k,b)e-j2kaeIp where s(k,b) is a<br>
baseline or un-shifted pilot sequence (e.g., a constant modulus signal<br>
such as QPSK a CAZAC sequence, a GCL sequence, or the DFT/IDFT<br>
of a CAZAC or GCL sequence), αℓ is the cyclic time shift for transmitter<br>
ℓ and P is a cyclic shift factor. As mentioned above the sequence can be<br>
generated either in the time or frequency domains. More details of the<br>
pilot signal generator 810 for time-domain generation of the pilot<br><br>
symbols are given in FIG. 8B. As can. be seen, the time-domain pilot<br>
sequence of length Mp, S(n,b), is first converted from serial to parallel<br>
821 and then a circular cyclic shift is applied 810 (i.e., the values are<br>
circularly shifted by αℓ samples if P=Mp). Then in 825 a Mp-point FFT<br>
is applied to give the frequency-domain pilot symbols xℓ(k,b). As an<br>
alternative to time-domain generation of the pilot symbols, the pilot<br>
symbols can be generated directly in the frequency domain as shown in<br>
FIG. 8C. In this case the frequency-domain pilot sequence, s(k,b) is fed<br>
into the serial to parallel converter 821 and then a phase ramp is applied<br>
829 which corresponds to the appropriate time shift and is given by the<br>
multiplication by the exponential term in the preceding equation.<br>
[0052]	A cyclic prefix is added by circuitry 807 followed by a<br>
parallel to serial converter 808. Also, although not shown, additional<br>
spectral shaping can be performed on the DFT-SOFDM signal to reduce<br>
its spectral occupancy or reduce its peak-to average ratio. This<br>
additional spectral shaping is conveniently implemented by additional<br>
processing before IDFT 806, and may for example be based on<br>
weighting or overlap-add processing. Finally the signal is sent over the<br>
RF channel through use of transmission circuitry 809.<br>
[0053]	In FIG. 8D a time-domain implementation of DFT-SOFDM<br>
transmitter (denoted as transmitter ℓ in the following equations) is<br>
given where the cyclic shift for the pilot block only is applied in the<br>
time domain. This embodiment may have implementation advantages<br>
since a time-domain cyclic shift is low complexity and thus the<br>
multiplication by a phase ramp (i.e., the exponential term in the pilot<br><br>
symbol equations or block 829 in FIG. 8C) is avoided as is the Mp-point<br>
IFFT (block 825 in FIG. 8B). Note the cyclic shift in 811 is not applied to<br>
data blocks. Only the blocks that are not common to FIG. 8A are now-<br>
explained. The time-domain pilot symbol generation 810 is described in<br>
FIG. 8E. In this embodiment of the pilot signal generator 810, the time-<br>
domain pilot sequence, S(n,b), goes through a serial to parallel converter<br>
821 and then an Mp-point FFT is taken to generate the frequency-<br>
domain pilot symbols. An alternative to the time-domain pilot signal<br>
generator 810 for the transmitter in FIG. 8D is the frequency-domain<br>
pilot signal generator given in FIG. 8F. In this embodiment, the<br>
frequency-domain pilot sequence, s(k,b) is only serial to parallel<br>
converted 821 to generate the pilot symbols. In both embodiments of<br>
the pilot signal generator, the cyclic shift for the pilot blocks is<br>
generated by performing a circular time shift 811. In one embodiment<br>
assume that the desired frequency-domain pilot sequence is given as<br>
(for Rp=1 and and b denotes the symbol where the pilot<br>
symbols are located): where s(k,b) is a baseline or<br>
un-shifted frequency-domain pilot sequence (e.g., a constant modulus<br>
signal such as QPSK, a CAZAC sequence, a GCL sequence, or the<br>
DFT/IDFT of a CAZAC or GCL sequence), at is the cyclic time shift for<br>
transmitter ℓ and P is a cyclic shift factor. Then the time-domain shift of<br>
αℓ samples would be applied to the time-domain samples received by<br>
block 811 (assuming P=Mp).<br>
[0054]	In one embodiment of the invention, a transmitter (e.g., as<br>
shown in FIG. 7 and FIG. 8) receives a resource allocation message, and<br>
determines pilot configuration information based on the received<br><br>
resource allocation message. The pilot configuration information may<br>
comprise cyclic time shift information for a first pilot block and a<br>
second pilot block, and block modulation coefficient information for the<br>
pilot blocks, and possibly information specifying the baseline or un-<br>
shifted pilot sequence. There axe various ways the pilot configuration<br>
information can be provided based on the resource allocation message.<br>
For example, the pilot configuration information can be directly<br>
specified in the message, or the pilot configuration information may be<br>
implicitly specified based on other information in the resource<br>
allocation message and predetermined mapping rules. An example of<br>
implicit specification is that the message specifies the resources to be<br>
used for data transmission (e.g., (Td,Rd,Sd) and a center frequency) by a<br>
transmitter, and there is a predetermined mapping between each<br>
possible data resource allocation and the pilot configuration<br>
information. Note that the pilot configuration information could also be<br>
specified with a combination of direct and implicit information from the<br>
resource allocation message.<br>
[0055]	FIG. 9 is a block diagram of receiver 900. The received<br>
signal is a composite of the channel distorted transmit signal from all<br>
the transmitters. During operation the received signal is converted to<br>
baseband by baseband conversion circuitry 901 and baseband filtered<br>
via filter 902. Once pilot and data information are received, the cyclic<br>
prefix is removed from the pilot and data blocks and the blocks are<br>
passed to channel estimation circuitry 904 and equalization circuitry<br>
905. As discussed above, a pilot signal is commonly used for<br>
communication systems to enable a receiver to perform a number of<br><br>
critical functions, including but not limited to, the acquisition and<br>
tracking of timing and frequency synchronization, the estimation and<br>
tracking of desired channels for subsequent demodulation and<br>
decoding of the information data, the estimation and monitoring of the<br>
characteristics of other channels for handoff, interference suppression,<br>
etc. With this in mind, circuitry 904 performs channel estimation on the<br>
occupied subcarriers for the data block utilizing at least received pilot<br>
blocks.<br>
[0056]	As described above, one embodiment of the channel<br>
estimator is the correlator given above. Assuming that the frequency-<br>
domain pilot sequence for the ℓth transmitter on subcarrier k and symbol<br>
(block) b is given as (for Rp=1):  where s(k,b) is a<br>
baseline or un-shifted pilot sequence (e.g., a constant modulus signal<br>
such as QPSK, a CAZAC sequence, a GCL sequence, or the DFT/IDFT<br>
of a CAZAC or GCL sequence), αℓ is the cyclic time shift for transmitter<br>
ℓ (for example assume that there are four transmitters and α1=0,<br>
α2=Tp/4, α3=Tp/2, and α4=3Tp/4), and P is a cyclic shift factor (for<br>
example, P=Tp), The channel estimator 904 correlates the original pilot<br>
sequence with the received pilot sequence with the cyclic prefix<br>
removed (ie., the composite received pilot block from, the four<br>
transmitters in the example) to get the time-domain channel estimates<br>
for each transmitter. In the example, the channel response to the first<br>
transmitter will be in a first block of Tp/4 correlator output samples (as<br>
also shown in FIG. 6 602 for this example), the channel response to the<br>
second transmitter will be in the next block of Tp/4 correlator output<br><br>
samples (as shown in FIG. 6 604), and so forth (as shown in FIG. 6 606<br>
and 608).<br>
[0057]	The channel estimate is passed to equalization circuitry 905<br>
so that proper equalization of the data blocks on the occupied<br>
subcarriers may be performed. The signal output from circuitry 905<br>
comprises an appropriately equalized data signal that is passed to a<br>
user separation circuitry 906 where an individual user's signal is<br>
separated from the data signal (the transmission from a single user<br>
corresponds to a transmission from each transmitter at the user). The<br>
user separation can be performed in time-domain or frequency-domain<br>
and can be combined with the equalization circuitry 905. Finally<br>
decision device 907 determines the symbols/bits from the user-<br>
separated signal that were transmitter.<br>
[0058]	FIG.. 10 shows a flow chart representation of an<br>
embodiment of a receiver (e.g., base station) that will determine channel<br>
estimates from one of two transmitters in accordance to the present<br>
invention. In block 1001 the receiver receives a first block over a<br>
plurality of subcarriers at a first time, wherein the first block comprises<br>
a first pilot sequence with a first time shift from a first transmitter and a<br>
second pilot sequence with a second time shift from a second<br>
transmitter. Then in block 1003, the receiver receives a second block<br>
over the plurality of subcarriers at a second time, wherein the second<br>
block comprises a third pilot sequence with a third time shift from the<br>
first transmitter and a fourth pilot sequence with a fourth time shift<br>
from the second transmitter, wherein the third time shift depends on<br><br>
the first time shift and the fourth time shift depends on the second time<br>
shift. Finally in block 1005, the receiver processes the first block and the<br>
second block to recover channel estimates for one of the first transmitter<br>
and the second transmitter, while suppressing the signal from the other<br>
transmitter.<br>
[0059]	FIG. 11 shows a flow chart representation of an<br>
embodiment of a transmitter that will create a pilot sequence in<br>
accordance to the present invention. In block 1101, the transmitter<br>
receives a resource allocation message from the receiver that will<br>
receive the transmitter's pilot sequence. In block 1103, the transmitter<br>
determines, based on the resource allocation message, a first time shift,<br>
a second time shift, and a set of block modulation coefficients. Then in<br>
block 1105, the transmitter transmits a first block over a plurality of<br>
subcarriers at a first time, wherein the first block comprises a first pilot<br>
sequence with the first time shift and is multiplied by the first block<br>
modulation coefficient. Finally in block 1107, the transmitter transmits<br>
a second block over the plurality of subcarriers at a second time,<br>
wherein the second block comprises a second pilot sequence with the<br>
second time shift and is multiplied by the second block modulation<br>
coefficient, wherein the second time shift depends on the first time shift.<br>
[0060]	In an additional embodiment of the invention, each, of a<br>
plurality of transmitters is assigned a different cyclic shift value from a<br>
set of cyclic delay values to be used for pilot transmission on a pilot<br>
block. The different cyclic delay values are chosen and assigned in a<br>
manner that increases the separability of the channel estimates of the<br><br>
transmitters at a receiver by increasing the spacing between the<br>
assigned cyclic shift values. Consider a system where the cyclic delay<br>
values available for assignment to transmitters are TO + k*T1, where k is<br>
a non-negative integer 
when the number of transmitters being assigned to transmit a pilot in a<br>
pilot block is less than kmax and greater than one, then the cyclic delay<br>
values (or values of k) assigned to the transmitters are non-contiguous.<br>
Non-contiguous means that there are at least two cyclic delay values<br>
that are not assigned to a transmitter, a first unassigned cyclic delay and<br>
a second unassigned cyclic delay, and that at least one cyclic delay (a<br>
third cyclic delay), which has a value between the first unassigned<br>
cyclic delay and the second unassigned cyclic delay is assigned to a<br>
transmitter. In addition, the cyclic delay values assigned to the<br>
transmitters are preferably maximally separated. For example, if there<br>
are four possible cyclic shift values of 0, T1, 2T1, and 3T1 in a pilot block<br>
of length 4T1 and two transmitters are being assigned to transmit in a<br>
pilot block, the separation between the assigned cyclic delays would be<br>
chosen as 2X1 to provide maximal separation (note that when the pilot<br>
block length is 4T1, the cyclic delay values of 0 and 3T1 are actually<br>
adjacent rather than maximally separated, since the cyclic delays are<br>
circular delays) first transmitter can be assigned a cyclic shift of 0 and<br>
the second transmitter can be assigned acyclic shift of 2T1. By assigning<br>
maximally separated cyclic delays to the transmitters, extra protection is<br>
provided against unexpected channel conditions, such as channels<br>
where the delay spread is longer than the difference between<br>
consecutive cyclic delays. A flow chart for this embodiment is shown in<br>
FIG. 12. In step 1202, a plurality of transmitters is selected for<br><br>
assignment of pilot transmission configuration information. Each of the<br>
plurality of transmitters is to be assigned a pilot transmission<br>
configuration. In step 1204, a different cyclic delay is assigned to each<br>
of the plurality of transmitters from, a set of cyclic delays, for pilot<br>
transmission by each of the transmitters wherein the cyclic delays are<br>
assigned to the transmitters such that the assigned cyclic delay values<br>
are non-contiguous (not all contiguous). The non-contiguous<br>
assignment may further comprise leaving a first cyclic delay unassigned<br>
and a second cyclic delay unassigned, and may further comprise<br>
assigning at least one of the cyclic delays having a value between the<br>
first unassigned cyclic delay and the second unassigned cyclic delay to<br>
a transmitter. The method may further comprise assigning non-<br>
consecutive cyclic delays to two of the plurality of transmitters, where<br>
at least one of the two transmitters has a channel delay spread that<br>
exceeds the spacing between adjacent cyclic delay values of the set of<br>
cyclic delay values.<br>
[0061]	A block diagram of a controller unit in accordance with the<br>
embodiment of FIG. 12 is shown in FIG. 13. The controller unit 1300<br>
includes transmitter selection circuitry 1302, for selecting a plurality of<br>
transmitters for assignment of pilot transmission configuration<br>
information, transmitter assignment circuitry 1304, for providing the<br>
cyclic delay assignment information, and transmitter circuitry 1306, for<br>
transmitting the assignment information. Controller unit 1300 may be<br>
embedded in a communication unit such as a base station, and is<br>
coupled to the transmitter of the communication unit to transmit the<br>
assignment information to the plurality of transmitters.<br><br>
[0062]	Although some embodiments of the present invention use<br>
the same block length and repetition factor (for IFDMA) or subcarrier<br>
mapping (for DFT-SOFDM) for each of the pilot blocks within a burst,<br>
alternate embodiments may use a plurality of block lengths and/or a<br>
plurality of repetition factors and/or subcarrier mappings for the<br>
plurality of pilot blocks within a burst. Note that different bock lengths<br>
provide different subcarrier bandwidths, which may further enhance<br>
the channel estimation capability.<br>
[0063]	The pilot configuration for a burst (e.g., the first or second<br>
configuration of FIG. 13) is preferably assigned by the base station<br>
dynamically based on channel conditions, such as the rate of channel<br>
variations (Doppler), but the assignment can be based on requests from<br>
the mobile unit, or on uplink measurements made by the base unit from<br>
previously received uplink transmissions. As described, the<br>
determination may be based on a channel condition such as Doppler<br>
frequency or on a number of antennas used for transmitting data<br>
symbols, and the determination can be made by the base unit, or by a<br>
mobile unit which then sends a corresponding request to the base unit.<br>
In systems with a scheduled uplink, the base unit can then assign the<br>
appropriate pilot format to the mobile unit for the subsequent<br>
transmissions from the mobile unit.<br>
[0064]	While the invention has been particularly shown and<br>
