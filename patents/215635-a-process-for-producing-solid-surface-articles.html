				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for producing solid surface articles. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Solid surface articles are those which have colour texture and composition consistent throughout the cross section of the article compared to gelocated polymer composite articles which are heterogeneous in nature. However, such solid surface articles are expensive in costs.<br>
To make solid surface articles cost effective, it is known to adhere a thinner solid surface material to the upper surface of a particle board and a commercially available water resistant laminate on the lower side. The edge are sealed by pieces of solid surfacing material.<br><br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
According   to   this   invention   there   is   provided   a   process   for producing solid surface articles which comprises in the steps of:<br>
a)	inserting an inlay material into a mould; characterized by<br>
b)	pouring   a   solid   surface   material   into   said   mould   to<br>
constitute an overlay;<br>
c)	inserting temporary liners;<br>
d)	introducing an underlay material to constitute an underlay<br>
having dimensions less than the mould by the thickness of<br>
edges obtained by insertion of temporary liners;<br>
e)	filling the space between the mould and underlay material<br>
with solid surface material to form solid surface edges and<br>
allowing to set to form the article;<br>
f)	demoulding the article and subjecting it to the process of<br>
finishing.<br><br>
In accordance with one embodiment of this invention, the underlay or core material is selected from known board materials such as particle board, and a solid surface material is lined on both sides of the underlay such that the underlay is encapsulated within solid surface layers on all sides.<br>
In accordance with a second embodiment, the low cost underlay made out of resins such as polysters and fillers to form cost effective composite has a solid surface material over lay only on the upper side and on edges.<br>
In accordance with yet another embodiment of the instant invention where the underlay comprises of a low cost board material, the solid surface material is provided as an overlay and ai the edges and the exposed composite of surface of the underlay has a lining of said cost effective polyester resin arid fillers.<br>
All the aforesaid embodiments ;rnpart an appearance of a single-solid surface lining of a<br><br>
higher thickness. In the instant invention, as an example of a thickness of 1/8" of solid surface lining is provided on either side of the particle boards of 1/2" 
The article of the present invention imparts an appearance of single solid surface lining with high strength. Strength is almost double the strength of current international solid surface material using particle board core as described earlier.<br>
In the present invention, a solid surface lining on both sides or solid surface lining on one side and polymer composite lining on the other side is provided during the step of moulding. Hence, no adhesives are required and bonding is positive, unlike in the known methods of producing solid surface articles.<br>
This   method  also  provides for savings  by  in-process  ready made  edges,  inâ€”lays and  bowl  cut-outs<br><br>
without involving additional manufacturing stapes, labour and materials.<br>
This process of the present invention consists in inserting an inlay material into a mould and<br>
then pouring a solid surface material to constitute the overlay. An underlay material comprisinq a board<br>
material  is  introduced  over the. over  lay   into  the<br>
* -<br>
mould arid has dimensions less that the mould by the thickness of edges. The space between the mould and underlay material is filled with solid surface material to form solid surface edges and which is then allowed to set to form the article. The article is demoulded and finally subjected to the step of finishing.<br>
In the embodiment where the underlay comprises a polymer temporary liners are inserted after pouring of solid' surface overlay material. The underlay polymer material is poured into said mould such that formed underlay material has dimensions less than the mould by the thickness of edge obtained by insertion of said temporary liners. The space between the underlay and mould is again filled with solid surface materials to obtain solid surface edges.<br><br>
The temporary liners are ""removed and the polymer and solid surface material is allowed to set. Tht article is demoulded and subjected to a process of finishing.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment a solid surface material is poured onto the exposed surface of underlay and allowed to set, demould and subject<br>
/<br>
of the steps of finishing. From the above, it can be realised that the process is flexible and offers various options in terms of materials and methods for the production of encapsulated product depending upon end application and market.<br>
The typical test results of the     Compressive   Flexural Strength products are as follows when    Strength Kgs/Cm   Kgs/Cm tested under standard test conditions as per ASTM-D790 &amp; ASTM-D695.<br>
a)	One side Solid Surface layer of    187.43      179.88<br>
1/8" thick glued to 18 mm particle<br>
board and on other side of the particle board 0.5 mm thick water resistant laminate is glued (This is conventional product)<br>
b)	The Solid Surface sandwich        352.23        306.45<br>
panel of instant invention is<br>
having I/O" Solid, Surface layers on both sides with a core of 12 mm thick particle board.<br>
c)	Solid Surface sandwich panel of    326.09      192.20<br>
instant invention having 1/8" Solid<br>
Surface layers on both sides with a core of 18mm thick particle board<br>
d)	Solid surface sandwitch panel of    475.53      333.84<br>
instant invention having 1/8" Solid<br>
Surface layers on both sides with a core of 188 mm thick particle board<br><br>
From the above results it is clear that the strength at product 'a' is very low when compared to the strengths of the product b, c &amp; d.<br>
Also appearance of the product of the instant invention in b, c &amp; d is much superior when compared to the product 'a'.<br>
The product at b, c, , d described above wi 1 1 have solid s u r f a c e  e d g e s .<br>
General description of the process is given below: A layer of about 1/8" thick Solid Surface material (typically of Acrylic modified resin, filler such as A T H and other fillera &amp; pigments ) is poured, core is inserted which is having d i men si on lower than mould by the thickness of edqe needed. the space between core and mould is again filled with the same sr similar material to create solid surface edges. Top of the core is again filled with either same material or cheaper compois i t i ons .<br>
The core can be of any flat material or shaped material or can be replaced by other resin nous composition (typically polyester with fillers like Calcite, Fly Ash, Perlite etc). The product is demoulded, flash is removed and product is finished. It is possible to insert desiqns into tlte mould ;nd then fill the Bolid Surface- material before placing core to get d es i red i n1 ay e f f ect<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
