				<td>BACKGROUND<br>
The present invention relates to cellular communication networks. More particularly, and<br>
not by way of limitation, the present invention is directed to a system and method for<br>
making intra- and inter-frequency measurements by a user equipment (UE) in a cellular<br>
communication network.<br>
In the evolution of mobile cellular communication standards such as Global System for<br>
Mobile Communication (GSM) and Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA),<br>
new modulation techniques such as Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)<br>
are anticipated to be implemented. In order to smoothly transfer the existing cellular<br>
communication systems to the new high capacity high data rate system in the existing radio<br>
spectrum, a new system able to operate on a flexible bandwidth (BW) is required. One<br>
such flexible cellular system is known as long term evolution of 3GPP (3G LTE), which can<br>
be viewed as an evolution of the 3G WCDMA standard. 3G LTE will likely use Orthogonal<br>
Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and will be able to operate on bandwidths<br>
spanning from 1.25 MHz to 20 MHz.<br>
It is anticipated that a 3G LTE system will allow frequency reuse. In frequency reuse, all<br>
cells can use the same carrier frequency. Although WCDMA systems also allow for<br>
frequency reuse, in Multiple Access OFDM (OFDMA), the intra- and inter-frequency hand<br>
over (HO) measurements present challenges because a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is<br>
needed both for data detection and intra- and inter-frequency measurements. In WCDMA,<br>
a path searcher, which is required for obtaining the radio paths, could also be used for<br>
signal strength measurements, hence the RAKE detector could be used exclusively for<br>
data detection, while in OFDMA, the FFT is used for both tasks.<br>
There foregoing challenges are handled differently by conventional methods. The first<br>
conventional method is to create gaps for intra- and inter-frequency measurements. When<br><br>
a User Equipment (UE) is close to a cell border, the UE requests an interruption in the<br>
reception in order to allocate the FFT to the neighboring (NB) cell. Disadvantageously, this<br>
results in a lower throughput due to the need to interrupt the data reception. The second<br>
conventional method requires synchronization of base stations. In this case, all cells have<br>
the same timing and when performing the FFT, all cells (serving cells (SC) and NB cells)<br>
pilot signals can be detected and signal strength estimated. Disadvantageously, this<br>
second method requires that the cells be synchronized. The third conventional method is<br>
to use two FFTs. One FFT is used for SC detection and one FFT is used for neighboring<br>
(NB) cell measurements. The disadvantage with this third conventional method is the need<br>
for two FFTs, resulting in an increased chip area cost in the UE. Hence there is a need for<br>
a method and apparatus for efficient handling of intra- and inter-frequency measurements<br>
in an OFDMA system.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present invention comprises a method and apparatus that utilizes the synchronization<br>
channel (SCH), which is a known time signal that is periodically transmitted with certain<br>
correlation properties. The SCH is used by the UE to obtain time synchronization<br>
information and to perform cell search. In order to perform the SCH detection, only a<br>
correlation between the known SCH signal and the received sequence is needed, hence<br>
the FFT is not involved in the synchronization step. Typically the pilot OFDM symbols, as<br>
well as the SCH, are transmitted with a constant power which is the same for all base<br>
stations. Hence, based on the SC SCH and pilot symbols, the power relation between<br>
these signals is estimated and the ratio applied when performing time synchronization to<br>
other cells (i.e. correlation the received sequence with the SCH from that particular NB cell)<br>
to estimate the pilot signal strength for the NB cell. According to the latest 3GPP<br>
Specification, SCH is transmitted every 5 milliseconds. Hence, using this technique, the<br>
FFT is not required for estimating the signal strengths for the NB cells, thereby overcoming<br>
the above cited disadvantages associated with the conventional methods. Another<br>
advantage of the present invention is that the base station transceiver (also known as node<br>
B) does not need to transmit all pilot signals in all resource blocks, which it may do even in<br>
almost empty cells, in order to perform HO measurements. Hence, the present invention is<br><br>
adapted to reduce pilot overhead allowing increased capacity in a cellular<br>
telecommunications system.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
In the following section, the invention will be described with reference to exemplary<br>
embodiments illustrated in the figures, in which:<br>
FIG. 1 is a time frequency structure for a DL OFDM system;<br>
FIG. 2 is a flow chart of the method of the present invention; and<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an apparatus adapted to implement the method of the present<br>
invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Figure 1 provides a time frequency structure for a downlink (DL) portion of an OFDM<br>
system. A superframe 101, typically 10 ms in duration and having a certain bandwidth,<br>
consists of a number of subframes 102. As seen therein, the synchronization channel<br>
(SCH) 103 is transmitted at regular intervals, typically corresponding to one OFDM symbol<br>
per 5 ms. The SCH is used by a UE, such as a mobile terminal, cellular telephone and the<br>
like, to obtain time and frequency synchronization information from a cell and hence is used<br>
in the cell search procedure. An exemplary SCH consists of (a) two different signals, a<br>
primary signal being the same for all cells and used for time synchronization and a<br>
secondary signal that is different for different cells and is used for detecting the cell ID, or<br>
(b) one signal constructed in such a way that the timing can be found by autocorrelation of<br>
the signal while the cell ID is found by cross-correlation with known cell ID sequences. The<br>
present invention is applicable to either of the foregoing SCH constructions. For the UE to<br>
detect the cells, the SCH signals 103 are typically transmitted at high power equally from all<br>
cells. Also as noted in Figure 1, some sub-carriers 104 in each OFDM symbol are known<br>
pilot signals. These pilot signals are used for estimating the radio channel in the frequency<br>
domain and used for equalizing the channel. In a cellular system, the pilot signals 105 are<br>
often also used as indicators of the signal strength, for example by summing the power of a<br><br>
well defined number of pilot signals. The signal strength is estimated for both of (1) the<br>
serving cell (SC), which is the cell that the UE is connected or camping on, and (2) the<br>
detected neighboring (NB) cells, which are the cells the UE has detected in the cell search.<br>
The estimated signal strength is used by the UE to find suitable HO candidates during<br>
mobility. In order to have sufficient signal strength measurements, the pilot signals 105 are<br>
transmitted with high and equal power.<br>
The SCH power is defined as the magnitude of the correlation result summed over the<br>
length of the cyclic prefix around the correlation peak. Mathematically, this is written as:<br><br>
where Di is the squared magnitude of the correlation result at time i,i0 index<br>
giving the largest Di (correlation peak), τcp is the length of the cyclic prefix (in samples).<br>
The pilot power is the sum of the squared magnitude of the channel estimates for well<br>
defined number of pilots in an OFDM symbol or resource block (group of OFDM symbols),<br>
i.e. <br>
where Pi =|hi|2 and hi is the channel estimate for pilot i. Typically, the number of pilots<br>
included is the number of pilots 105 transmitted over the entire bandwidth in one OFDM<br>
symbol 106 or the sum over all pilots in one resource block 107, as seen in Figure 1. One<br>
resource block is the smallest amount of data that can be allocated to one user. It is a<br>
block of 12 sub-carriers in frequency and 7 OFDM symbols, i.e., in .5 ms in time.<br>
The ratio between the SCH power and the pilot power is a constant, i.e.<br>
Ppilot I PSCH= γ embodiment of the present invention, the ratio<br>
Ppilot I PSCH= γ can be obtained by the UE from a look-up table. If γ is obtained<br>
from a look-up table, the values thereof can be based on operator requirements and/or the<br><br>
number of transmitted pilots, which in turn depends on known system parameters such as<br>
the current bandwidth and number of transmit antennas. In another embodiment of the<br>
present invention,γ is estimated from the SC, while for NB cells, the pilot power is<br>
estimated according to:<br><br>
A flow chart illustrating the steps 200 of the present invention is provided in Figure 2.<br>
When these steps are performed, the UE is connected (active mode) or camping (idle<br>
mode) on SC. In step 201, the UE correlates the SCH for SC with the received signal to<br>
find the timing and power of the SC SCH in step 202. Next, in step 203, the UE performs an<br>
FFT of the received signal to obtain the pilot and data symbols and computes the signal<br>
strength based on the SC pilot symbols. In step 204, the ratio γ is obtained either via look-<br>
up table or as computed by the UE. In step 205, and on a regular basis (typically 10-20<br>
times/second), the UE correlates the received signal to the SC SCH and also to all NB cells<br>
SCH in the detected set. Then, in step 206, the power for SC and NB cells are computed.<br>
In step 207 the pilot power is computed according to equation (3) above. In step 208, the<br>
UE compares the pilot power for NB cells to the pilot power for the SC and, in step 209,<br>
detects whether a HO is needed. If so, the HO procedure begins in step 210, if not, the<br>
process returns to step 205.<br>
Figure 3 is a block diagram 300 of an apparatus that is adapted to implement the novel<br>
method described above. As seen therein, the signal is received in the antenna 301 and<br>
down converted to a baseband signal in the front end receiver (Fe RX) 302. The signal is<br>
sent to both the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) unit 303 and the cell search (CS) unit 304.<br>
The CS unit 304 finds new cells, by correlating the received signal to the SCH signal, as<br>
well as timing of SC and NB cells. The timing information is used by the FFT unit 303 to<br>
determine the samples on which to perform the FFT. The pilot is extracted and sent to the<br>
channel estimation (CH est) unit 305, estimating the channel (represented by a vector H).<br>
Also the SC pilot power is computed in the CH est unit 305 and fed together with the SCH<br>
power estimate of the SC to the y estimation unit 306. y is obtained (either via a look-up<br><br>
table or estimated) and applied to the SCH power estimate for NB cells in a control unit<br>
(CU) 307 and the pilot power for NB cells is computed. The pilot power is fed to the Layer 3<br>
processing (L3 proc) unit 308 that compares the power for SC and NB cells and decides<br>
whether a HO is required.<br>
As will be recognized by those skilled in the art, the innovative concepts described in the<br>
present application can be modified and varied over a wide range of applications.<br>
