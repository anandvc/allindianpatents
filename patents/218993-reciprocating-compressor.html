				<td>The present invention relates to a reciprocating compressor, and<br>
particularly to a reciprocating compressor that can be compact in size and<br>
having improved performance.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Figure 1 is a sectional view showing a reciprocating compressor in<br>
accordance with one example of a conventional art.<br>
A conventional reciprocating compressor includes a close casing to<br>
which a suction pipe 102 and a discharge pipe 104 are connected<br>
respectively; a driving unit 108 disposed in the casing 106 and generating a<br>
reciprocal movement force; a compression unit 110 transmitted the reciprocal<br>
movement force generated at the driving unit 108 and compressing a fluid; a<br>
support portion 112 supporting the driving unit 108 and the compression unit<br>
110.<br>
The driving unit 108 includes an outer stator 116 fixed at the support<br>
portion 112 and having a winding coil 114 to which power is applied; an inner<br>
stator 118 disposed at an inner circumferential surface of the outer stator 116<br>
with a predetermined air gap therebetween; a magnet 120 positioned at the air<br>
gap between the outer stator 116 and the inter stator 118 and linearly and<br>
reciprocally moved when power is applied to the winding coil 114; and a<br>
moving member 122 mounted to the magnet 120 at a same interval in a<br><br>
WO 2005/033509	PCT/KR2003/002054<br>
2<br>
circumferential direction and transmitting a linear movement of the magnet<br>
120 to the piston 124 by being coupled with a piston 124 of. the compression,<br>
unit 110.<br>
The compression unit 110 includes a piston 124 linearly and<br>
reciprocally moved by being coupled with the moving member 122; a cylinder<br>
130, in which the piston 124 is slidably inserted, having a compression<br>
chamber; and a suction valve 132 installed at a front portion of the piston 124<br>
to prevent the fluid introduced into the compression chamber from being<br>
flowed backwardly; a discharge valve assembly 134 installed at a front portion<br>
of the cylinder 130 to perform an open-and-shut action of a discharged fluid.<br>
The support unit 112 includes a first frame 140 to which the inner stator<br>
118 is fixed, mounted to an outer circumferential surface of the cylinder 130,<br>
and supporting one side surface of the outer stator 116; a second frame 142<br>
supporting the other side surface of the outer stator 116; a third fame 144<br>
coupled with the second frame 142 and receiving a resonant spring unit 146,<br>
The resonant spring unit 146 for inducing a resonant movement of the<br>
piston 124, includes a first resonant spring 148 interposed between the first<br>
frame and one side surface of a connecting portion 152 between the moving<br>
member 122 and the piston 124, and providing an elastic force to the piston<br>
124 when the piston 124 is rearwardly moved; and second resonant spring<br>
150 interposed between the other side surface of the connecting portion 152<br>
and the third frame 144, and providing an elastic force to the piston 124 when<br>
the piston 124 is forwardly moved in order to compress a fluid.<br>
Herein, the first resonant spring 148 and the second resonant spring<br><br>
WO 2005/033509	PCT/KR2003/002054<br>
3<br>
150 are formed of a compression coil spring. The first resonant spring 148 has<br>
a bigger diameter than an outer diameter of the cylinder 130 and positioned at<br>
the outer circumferential surface of the cylinder 130, and the second resonant<br>
spring 150 is positioned at a rear portion of the compression unit 110.<br>
In the convention reciprocating compressor, when power is applied to a<br>
winding coil 114, a flux is formed between the outer stator 115 and the inner<br>
stator, and thus the magnet 120 and the moving member 122 are linearly and<br>
reciprocally moved. While the piston 124 connected to the moving member<br>
122 is linearly and reciprocally moved in the cylinder 130, a fluid is<br>
compressed.<br>
At this time, when the piston 124 forwardly moves to compress a fluid,<br>
an elastic force of a second resonant spring 150 is provided to the piston 124,<br>
and when moving rearwardly, an elastic force of a first resonant spring 148 is<br>
provided to the piston 124.<br>
However, in the conventional reciprocating compressor, the first<br>
resonant spring 148 is positioned in a space between an outer circumferential<br>
surface of the cylinder 130 and an inner circumferential surface of the inner<br>
stator 118. Accordingly, a width of a compressor should be big because a<br>
predetermined space should be secured to install the first resonant spring 148<br>
between the outer circumferential surface of the cylinder 130 and the inner<br>
stator 118.<br>
Also, since the first and the second springs 148 and 150 are formed of<br>
a compression coil spring having a torsion moment, and are disposed at the<br>
both sides of a connection unit 152 between the moving member 122 and the<br><br>
WO 2005/033509	PCT7KR2003/002054<br>
4<br>
piston respectively, the torsion moment occurs while the first and the second<br>
springs 148 and 150 repeatedly compress and expand. Because of this, it is<br>
difficult for the piston 124 to keep its linear movement, so performance of a<br>
motor is deteriorated.<br>
Figure 2 is a sectional view showing a reciprocating compressor for<br>
solving those problems according to another example of the conventional art.<br>
In a reciprocating compressor shown in Figure 2, a compression unit<br>
110 is disposed at a front portion of a casing 106 and fixed at a first frame 162,<br>
and a driving unit 108 is disposed at a rear portion of the casing 106, and fixed<br>
at second and third frames 164 and 166. A moving member 122 of the driving<br>
unit 108 and a piston 124 are connected mechanically and a spring supporting<br>
member is disposed at a connection portion of the moving member 122 and<br>
the piston 124.<br>
Also, plural first resonant springs 172 are disposed between the first<br>
frame 162 and a front portion surface of the spring supporting member 176 at<br>
a predetermined interval in a circumferential direction. Plural second resonant<br>
springs 174 are disposed between a rear portion surface of the spring<br>
supporting member 176 and the second frame at a predetermined interval in a<br>
circumferential direction.<br>
In the reciprocating compressor, a width of the compressor 110 can be<br>
reduced since the driving unit 108 and the compression unit 110 are<br>
positioned at front and rear portions of the casing 106 respectively and the<br>
first resonant spring 172 and the second resonant spring 174 are disposed at<br>
an outer circumferential portion of the compression 110. Also, since; the plural<br><br>
WO 2005/033509	PCT/KR2003/002054<br>
5<br>
first and second resonant springs 172 and 174 are disposed in a<br>
circumferential direction, a torsion moment caused by repeated compression<br>
and expansion of the springs can be reduced.<br>
However, in the reciprocating compressor according to the<br>
conventional art, the driving unit 108 generating a reciprocal movement force<br>
and the compression unit 110 transmitted the movement force from the driving<br>
unit 108 are disposed at the front portion and at rear portions of the<br>
compressor at a predetermined interval. Accordingly, it is difficult to adjust a<br>
concentricity of the driving unit 109 and the compression unit 110, and thus<br>
degrading of assembling is caused.<br>
That is, even though a concentricity of the inner and outer stators 116<br>
and 118 of the driving unit 108 has been adjusted, a concentricity of the<br>
driving unit 108 and the piston 124 of the compression unit 110 has to be<br>
adjusted again, and thus a difficulty of assembling is caused.<br>
In addition, since the driving unit 108 and the compression unit 110 are<br>
disposed at the front and rear portions of the casing 106 respectively, the<br>
concentricity of the piston 124 is severely deviated even though the<br>
concentricity of the moving member 122 is little bit deviated during an<br>
operation of the compressor. This causes a collision of the cylinder 130 and<br>
the piston 124 and, accordingly, performance of the compressor is<br>
deteriorated.<br>

There can be a plurality of embodiments of the reciprocating<br>
compressor in accordance with the present invention, and a preferred<br>
embodiment will now be described.<br>
Figure 3 is a sectional view of a reciprocating compressor according to<br>
the present invention.<br>
The reciprocating compressor of the present invention includes a<br>
casing 14 to which a suction pipe 10 and a discharge pipe12 are connected<br>
respectively; a driving unit 16 disposed in the casing 14 and generating a<br>
reciprocal movement force; a compression unit 18 disposed in the driving unit<br>
16 and compressing a fluid by being transmitted the reciprocal movement<br>
force of the driving unit 16; a support unit 20 supporting the driving unit 16 and<br>
the compression unit 18; a resonant spring assembly 24 installed at the<br>
support unit 20 and inducing a resonant movement of the piston 22 by<br>
providing an elastic force to the piston 22 of the compression unit 18.<br><br>
WO 2005/033509	PCT/KR2003/002054<br>
9<br>
The driving unit 16 includes an outer stator 26 fixed at the support<br>
portion 20; an inner stator 28 disposed between itself and an inner<br>
circumferential surface of the outer stator 26 at a predetermined air gap; a<br>
winding coil 30 to which power is applied, disposed at one of the outer stator<br>
28 and the inner stator 28; a magnet 32 installed at the air gap between the<br>
outer stator 26 and the inner stator 28, and linearly and reciprocally moved<br>
when power is applied to the winding coil 30; a moving member 34 at which<br>
the magnet 32 is fixed at a same interval in a circumferential direction,<br>
transmitting a linear movement of the magnet to the piston 22 by being<br>
coupled with the piston 22 of the compression unit 18.<br>
The compression unit 18 includes a cylinder 38 fixed at the inner<br>
circumferential surface of the inner stator 28, and having a compression<br>
chamber 36 in which a fluid is compressed; a piston 22 linearly and movably<br>
inserted in the cylinder 38, coupled with the moving member 34, linearly<br>
moved when the moving member 32 is linearly moved, thereby compressing a<br>
fluid in the compression chamber 36; a suction valve 40 mounted to a front<br>
portion of the piston 122 to prevent the fluid introduced into the compression<br>
chamber from being flowed backwardly; a discharge valve assembly 42<br>
disposed.at a front portion of the cylinder 38 to perform an open-and-shut<br>
action of a discharged fluid.<br>
Herein, as shown in Figures 4 and 5, the cylinder 38 is fixed at the inner<br>
circumferential surface of the inner stator 28 by a press-fit method or the like.<br>
That is, since the cylinder is directly fixed at the inner circumferential surface<br>
of the inner stator 28 and thus there is no gap therebetween, a width of the<br><br>
WO 2005/033509	PCT/KR2003/002054<br>
10<br>
compressor can be reduced.<br>
The support unit 20 includes a first frame 46 mounted to the outer<br>
circumferential surface of the cylinder 38, and supporting one side surface of<br>
the outer stator 26; a second frame 48 supporting the other side surface of the<br>
outer stator 26; a third frame 50 coupled with the second frame 48 and<br>
receiving a resonant spring unit 24.<br>
In the first frame 46, an outer circumferential surface of the cylinder 38<br>
is supported at the inner circumferential surface of the first frame 46 by the<br>
press-fit method or the like, one side surface of the inner stator 28 is<br>
supported at its inner side surface, and one side surface of the outer stator 26<br>
is supported at its outer side surface.<br>
In the second frame 48, the other side surface of the outer stator 26 is<br>
supported at one side surface of the second frame 48. At the outer side<br>
surface of the second frame 48, the third frame 50 is fixed, and springs of the<br>
resonant spring unit 24 are supported.<br>
In the cylindrical-shaped third frame 50, its one end is fixed at the<br>
second frame 48, and prolonged at a certain length toward the rear portion of<br>
the casing 14. A fluid passage 52 through which a fluid taken into the inlet 10<br>
passes, is formed at the other end of the third frame 50, and springs of the<br>
resonant spring unit 24 are supported at its inner surface.<br>
As shown in Figure 6, the resonant spring unit 24 includes a spring<br>
support member 60 mounted to a portion where the piston 22 and the moving<br>
member 34 are connected; a first resonant spring 62 disposed between the<br>
second frame 48 and one side surface of the spring support member 60, and<br><br>
WO 2005/033509	PCT/KR2003/002054<br>
11<br>
providing an elastic force to the piston 22 when the piston moves rearwardly;<br>
a second resonant spring 64 disposed between the inner surface of the third<br>
frame 50 and the other side surface of the spring support member 60 and<br>
providing an elastic force to the piston 22 when the piston moves forwardly.<br>
Herein, the spring support member 60 includes a coupling portion 66<br>
positioned at the rear portion of the piston 22 and fixed at a portion where the<br>
moving member 34 and the piston 22 are coupled; plural first support portions<br>
68 prolonged from the edge of the coupling portion 66 at a certain interval in a<br>
circumferential direction and supporting the first resonant springs 62; second<br>
support portions 70 positioned between the first support portions 68, and<br>
supporting the second resonant spring 64.<br>
The disc-shaped coupling portion 66 has a passage 75 through which a<br>
fluid passes, at its center portion. The first support portion 68 is rearwardly<br>
prolonged from the edge of the coupling portion 66 at a certain length, and is<br>
outwardly bent at its end portion so as to install the first resonant springs 62.<br>
Plural first support portions 68 are formed at a certain interval in a<br>
circumferential direction of the coupling portion 66.<br>
The second support portions 70 are disposed between the first support<br>
portions 68 respectively, are radially prolonged from the edge of the coupling<br>
portion 66, and thus support the second resonant springs 64.<br>
In the first resonant spring 62, its both end portions are supported at<br>
the second frame 48 and at the first support portion 68 of the spring support<br>
member 60 respectively. In the second resonant spring 64, its both end<br>
portions are supported at the third frame 50 and at the second support portion<br><br>
WO 2005/033509	PCT/KR2003/002054<br>
12<br>
70 of the spring support member 60 respectively. Because of these, as shown<br>
in Figure 7, when the compressor is viewed from the side, the first resonant<br>
spring 62 and the second resonant spring 64 have an overlap section (L).<br>
Since the first resonant spring 62 and the second resonant spring 64 have the<br>
overlap section (L) in an axial direction of the compressor, a length in the axial<br>
direction of the compressor can be reduced.<br>
In a different example of the spring support member 60, an overlap<br>
section of the first resonant spring 62 and the second resonant spring 64 can<br>
be extended more by forming the second support portion to be bent.<br>
As shown in Figure 8, spring sheet portions 80 for supporting the first<br>
and the second resonant springs are formed at side surfaces of the first and<br>
the second support portions 68 and 70 respectively. The cylinder-shaped<br>
spring sheet portions 80 are prolonged from the side surfaces of the first and<br>
the second support portions 68 and 70 and support the first and the second<br>
resonant springs 62 and 64 respectively.<br>
Figure 9 shows a special spring sheet member 82 mounted to each of<br>
the first and the second support portions 68 and 70 to support the first and the<br>
second resonant springs 62 and 64. The spring sheet member 82 consists of<br>
a fixing portion 84 inserted and fixed at a through hole 88 formed in each one<br>
of the first and the second resonant springs 62 and 64 by a press fit method or<br>
the like; and a sheet portion 86 prolonged from the fixing portion 84 and<br>
supporting the first and the second resonant springs 62 and 64.<br>
The first and the second resonant springs 62 and 64 are formed of<br>
compression coil springs respectively, and offsetting torsion moments of each<br><br>
WO 2005/033509	PCT/KR2003/002054<br>
13<br>
other by having an opposite winding direction. As shown in Figure 10, that is,<br>
as shown in Figure 10, if the first resonant spring supported at the first support<br>
portion 68 is wound counterclockwise as the arrow P, the second resonant<br>
spring 64 disposed neighboring on the first resonant spring 62 is wound<br>
clockwise as the arrow Q.<br>
As shown in Figure 11, the winding directions of the first resonant<br>
springs 62 disposed to face each other are different with each other, and the<br>
winding directions of the second resonant springs 64 disposed to face each<br>
other are different with each other, too. That is, if one first resonant: spring 62<br>
is wound in a direction of the arrow S, the other neighboring first resonant<br>
spring 62 is wound in a direction of the arrow T. Also, if one second resonant<br>
spring 64 is wound in a direction of the arrow T, the other neighboring second<br>
resonant spring 64 is wound in a direction of the arrow S.<br>
Operations and effects of the reciprocating compressor will now be<br>
described.<br>
When power is applied to a winding coil 30, a flux is formed between an<br>
outer stator 26 and an inner stator 28. By the flux, a moving member 34 is<br>
linearly and reciprocally moved, and thus a piston 22 connected to the moving<br>
member 34 compresses and discharge a fluid introduced into a compression<br>
chamber while being moved linearly and reciprocally in a cylinder 34,<br>
At this time, when the piston 22 moves forwardly to compress a fluid,<br>
an elastic force of a second resonant spring 62 is provided to the piston 22,<br>
and when the piston 22 moves rearwardly, an elastic force of a first resonant<br>
spring 64 is provided to the piston 22,<br><br>

In the reciprocating compressor in accordance with the present<br>
invention, a width of the compressor can be reduced since a piston is directly<br>
fixed at the inner circumferential surface of the inner stator by a press-fit<br>
method or the like.<br>
An interval in a longitudinal direction between a moving member and a<br>
piston can be minimized by positioning the piston in a moving member,<br>
whereby a concentricity of the moving member and the piston can be easily<br>
adjusted during assembling, and an attrition of the piston and the cylinder and<br>
a collision of the moving member and the outer/inner stators are prevented.<br>
A length in an axial direction of the compressor can be reduced by<br>
disposing first and second resonant springs so as to overlap at a certain<br>
section.<br>
And, the plural first and second resonant springs are disposed in a<br>
circumferential direction, and their winding directions are arranged to be<br>
opposite with each other. Accordingly, since a torsion moment, which may<br>
occurs while each resonant spring compresses and expands, is prevented, a<br>
torsion of the piston and an attrition of portions being in contact with each<br>
resonant spring, are reduced, and thus reliability of a compressor can be<br>
improved.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications<br>
and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from<br>
the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present<br>
invention cover modifications and variations of this invention provided they<br>
come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.<br><br>
