				<td>CATIONIC AMPHIPHILES FOR INTRACELLULAR DELIVERY OF<br>
THERAPEUTIC MOLECULES ITS COMPOSITION, PROCESS AND USE<br>
THEREOF<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to novel cationic amphiphiles containing cyclic head<br>
group. The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising<br>
said cationic amphiphiles, useful for the delivery of biologically active therapeutic<br>
molecules into body cells/tissues of mammals.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Although many defective genes associated with numerous genetic diseases have been<br>
identified and characterized, because of the selective permeability of biological cell<br>
membranes, delivering required amounts of therapeutically important genes into the<br>
target body cells is often a daunting^hailenge.<br>
Thus, success of gene therapy approach in treating genetic diseases depends, in a<br>
major way, on the development of efficient and safe gene delivery reagents that will<br>
facilitate the intracellular delivery of therapeutic genes into the particular body cells<br>
of a patient. Accordingly, development of safe and efficient gene delivery reagents<br>
and methods that can facilitate entry of functional genes into body cells are of great<br>
medical importance.<br>
Amphiphilic molecules containing both polar and non-polar regions in their molecular<br>
architecture have been used in delivering therapeutically important molecules into<br>
cells. This makes sense given the existence of both polar and non-polar segments in<br>
biological cell membranes. Cationic amphiphiles are the particularly important class<br>
of amphiphilic compounds used most extensively for enhancing intracellular delivery<br>
of many biologically active therapeutic compounds. Broadly speaking, at'<br>
physiological pH the polar segment of cationic amphiphile interacts with the<br>
therapeutically important molecules including polyanionic macromolecular DNA,<br>
RNA, proteins etc. while the non-polar region of the cationic amphiphiles facilitate<br>
the passage of the therapeutic compounds through the non-polar part of the cell<br>
membranes.<br>
The following references are examples of cationic amphiphiles that are known in the<br>
art to be useful for enhancing the intracellular delivery of therapeutically important<br>
molecules. In addition to the molecular structures, these prior arts contain useful<br>

Yet another embodiment of the present invention, wherein said use is used to<br>

The present invention is also further explained in the form of preferred embodiments.<br>
The distinctive novel structural features common to the cationic amphiphiles<br>
disclosed in the present invention include:<br>
(1) The presence of hydrophobic groups which are directly linked to the positively<br>
charged nitrogen atom;<br>
(2) The positively charged nitrogen atom is part of the cyclic head group; and<br>
(3) Unlike many other, commercially available iglycerol-backbone based cationic<br>
amphiphiles used in delivering genes into cells, the presently disclosed cationic<br>
lipids do not have any glycerol-backbone in their molecular architectures. It is<br>
believed that these unique structural features contribute significantly to the<br>
increased gene delivery efficiencies of the cationic amphiphiles disclosed herein.<br>
According to the practice of the present invention, "cationic" means the positive<br>
charge is either on quaternized nitrogen and/or on a protonated substituent of the<br>
cyclic head group. The cationic characters of the present amphiphiles may contribute<br>
to the enhanced interaction of the amphiphiles with biologically active molecules such<br>
as nucleic acids and/or with cell constituents such as plasma membrane glycoproteins.<br>
Such enhanced interaction between the cationic amphiphiles and therapeutically<br>
active biological macromolecules and/or cell membrane constituents may play a key<br>
role in successfully transporting the therapeutic molecules into the cells.<br>
The invention cationic lipids have a lipophilic domain that facilitates the formation of<br>
lipid complexes or aggregates in aqueous solutions. The lipophilicity of the<br>
hydrophobic domains and the hydrophilicity of the polar head group domains are such<br>
that when the cationic lipids are confronted with aqueous solutions, lipid aggregates<br>
are formed in the presence or absence of a second compound. Exemplary lipophilic<br>
RI and R2 groups include (1) saturated Cg-C22 alkyl groups and (2) unsaturated Cg-C22<br>
alkyl groups containing one to three unsaturation.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the presently disclosed cationic lipids where n = 1,<br>
both RI and R2 are selected from Cg-C22 saturated alkyl groups, both RS and R4 are<br>
independently represented in any combination of groups selected from hydrogen,<br>
hydroxyl, hydroxy alkyl, amino or primary amine and X" is selected from chloride or<br>
bromide ions.<br>
Syntheses of the cationic lipids<br>
Scheme I outlines the synthetic strategy employed for preparing the cationic lipids of<br>
the present invention containing a five member cyclic head groups (n = 1 in generic<br>
Structure of formula (I). The same synthetic scheme is employed to synthesize<br>
cationic lipids with seven and nine member cyclic head groups (n = 2 and 3<br>
respectively, in generic Structure of formula (I).<br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
the primary hydroxyl groups of the starting alcohol is first converted to their<br>
tosyl derivative by reacting them with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride in presence of<br>
pyridine as a base. The resulting di-tosyl derivative (the intermediate II in Scheme I)<br>
is then subjected to reaction with the appropriate secondary amine in polar aprotic<br>
solvent like N.N-dimethyl formamide to form the cationic amphiphile (III), a tosylate<br>
counterion containing analog of the present cationic lipids. A final treatment of the<br>
intermediate III with chloride ion-exchange resins affords the target cationic<br>
amphiphile (I) of the present invention. As sh in Scheme I, to synthesize cationic<br>
lipids with two hydroxyl functionalities in ..^ cyclic head group, protecting the<br>
secondary hydroxyl group of the starting material is not necessary. However, to<br>
prepare cationic amphiphiles with two amino functionalities in the cyclic head group,<br>
execution of Scheme I requires protection of both the primary amino group of the<br>
starting material and a later deprotection step.<br>
Formulations<br>
The invention also provides novel therapeutic formulation comprising therapeutically<br>
effective amounts of the cationic amphiphilic compounds disclosed herein,<br>
biologically active molecules and co-lipids. One or more additional physiologically<br>
acceptable substances may be included in the pharmaceutical formulation of the<br>
invention to stabilize the formulation for storage or to facilitate successful<br>
intracellular delivery of the biologically active molecules. Co-lipids according to the<br>
practice of the present invention are useful in mixing with one or more cationic<br>
amphiphiles. Cholesterol is an excellent co-lipid for use in combination with the<br>
presently described cationic lipids to facilitate successful intracellular delivery of the<br>
biologically active molecules. A preferred range of molar ratio of cationic amphiphile<br>
to co-lipid is 1:0 to 1:2.5. As such, it is within the art to vary the said range to a<br>
considerably wide extent.<br>
Biologically active molecules that can be administered intracellularly in therapeutic<br>
amounts using the cationic amphiphilic compound of the present invention include<br>
ribosomal RNA, antisense polynucleotide of RNA or DNA, polynucleotide of<br>
genomic DNA, cDNA or mRNA that encodes for a therapeutically important protein.<br>
The cationic amphiphiles of the present invention may be blended such that one or<br>
more of the representatives thereof are used in a combination to facilitate entry of the<br>
said biologically active molecules into cells/tissues.<br>
According to the present invention, the amphiphiles are used either in pure form or in<br>
combination with other lipids or helper lipids such as cholesterol,<br>
phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, etc. The said therapeutic<br>
formulation can be stored at 0°C-4°C until complexed with the biologically active<br>
therapeutic molecules. Agents that prevent bacterial growth and increase the shelf life<br>
may be included along with reagents that stabilize the preparation, e.g., low<br>
concentrations of glycerol. It is specifically warned that freezing and thawing cycles<br>
could cause loss in efficiency of the formulation.<br>
The present invention also provides for various formulations that facilitate<br>
intracellular delivery of biologically active molecules.<br>
The present invention also provides for a formulation of cationic amphiphiles and<br>
nucleic acid may be administered intravenously besides other routes such as<br>
intramuscular and intra peritonial. Further, the said formulation of amphiphiles may<br>
be administered to cells at a ratio of 0.1-0.5 microgram of DNA to 50,000 cells in an<br>
in vitro system. The amount of amphiphile could be varied from a lipid to DNA<br>
charge ratio of 0.1 to 10, considering one positive charge for one amphiphile molecule<br>
to one negative charge of a nucleotide base.<br>
The plasmid used is a construct of an Cyto Megalo Virus promoter linked to a<br>
reporter gene p-galactosidase as supplied by Gibco BRL Life Technologies, USA (cat<br>
no.!0586-014)The plasmid could be of any construction and the example given is<br>
merely to demonstrate* the efficiency of the amphiphilic formulation. Similar<br>
examples of plasmid include PGL-2 and PGL-3 of Promega and others.<br>
The invention further provides a process for the preparation of the said formulation<br>
comprising the steps of preparing a dispersion of a cationic amphiphile disclosed in<br>
the present invention; contacting said dispersion with a biologically active molecule<br>
to form a complex between said amphiphiles and said molecules and contacting cells<br>
with said complex thereby facilitating transfer of said biologically active molecules<br>
into the cells.<br>
Cellular Cytotoxicities of the Amphiphiles Disclosed in the Invention<br>
The viabilities of cells in presence of various cationic amphiphiles disclosed herein<br>
were checked according to the standard protocol described in "Animal Cell Culture,<br>
2nd Edition. Ed. I. R. L. Press, Oxford University Press (1977)". The transfection<br>
efficiencies of the cationic lipids were studied in the range of 0-10 nmole and within<br>
this limit, the cell cytotoxicities were observed to be minimal and the cell viabilities<br>
were determined to be more than 80%. The cationic amphiphiles were used with<br>
varying mole ratios of lipid to DNA using cholesterol as the neutral co-lipid.<br>
Applications<br>
The process of the present invention can be exploited for preparing cationic<br>
transfection lipids with polar cyclic head groups. The invention lipids are useful for<br>
delivering polyanions, polypeptides or nucleopolymers into cells. The cationic lipids<br>
disclosed herein can be used to deliver an expression vector into a cell for<br>
manufacturing or therapeutic use. The expression vectors can be used in gene therapy<br>
protocols to deliver a therapeutically useful protein to a cell or for delivering nucleic<br>
acids encoding therapeutically useful protein molecules that can generate an immune<br>
response in a host for vaccine or other immunomodulatory purposes according to the<br>
known uses. The vector-transformed cell can be used to produce commercially useful<br>
cell lines, such as a cell line for producing therapeutic proteins or enzymes (e.g.<br>
erythropoietin), growth factors (e.g. human growth hormone, G-CSF or interleukins)<br>
or other proteins.<br>
The invention lipid-nucleic acid complexes can be used to construct cell lines for gene<br>
therapy applications in subjects such as humans or other species including murine,<br>
feline, bovine, equine, ovine or non-human primate species. The invention lipids can<br>
be used in presence of serum and will thus deliver polyanions into cells in tissue<br>
culture medium containing serum in vitro or in animal in vivo.<br>
The invention lipids complexed with nucleopolymers can be used in antisense<br>
inhibition of gene expression in a cell by delivering an antisense oligonucleotide into<br>
the cell. A cell that is blocked for expression of a specific gene(s) is useful for<br>
manufacturing and therapeutic applications. Exemplary manufacturing uses include<br>
inhibiting protease synthesis in a cell to increase production (i.e., reduce target protein<br>
degradation caused by the protease) of a protein for a therapeutic or diagnostic<br>
application. Exemplary therapeutic applications include inhibiting synthesis of cell<br>
surface antigens (histocompatibility antigens, such as MHC class II genes, and the<br>
like) to reduce rejection and/or to induce immunologic tolerance of the cell after it is<br>
implanted into a subject or when the cell is transfected in vivo.<br>
The invention lipids can be formulated with anionic, zwitterionic and lipophilic<br>
therapeutic agents including anticancer agents such as doxorubicin, a lipophilic<br>
compound, to obtain complexes comprising the invention lipids and a therapeutic<br>
agent(s). The invention lipids can be formulated with known antiviral agents such as<br>
HPMPC (9-(3 -hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxy)propyl)cytosine), PMEA(9-(2-<br>
phosphonylmethoxy)ethyl)adenine), PMEG PMEA (9-(2-phosphonylmethoxy) ethyl)<br>
guanine), PMPA (9-(2-phosphonylmethoxy)propyl)adenine), AZT, 3TC, and their<br>
derivatives to obtain lipid complexes with antiviral agents. The invention lipids can<br>
be formulated with polyene antibiotics such as amphotericin B. Such<br>
formulations are useful for delivering the therapeutic agents into the cytoplasm of<br>
cells in vitro or in vivo. Complexes consisting of an invention cationic lipid and an<br>
anti-influenza agent can be used to deliver the antiviral agent to the lung, the primary<br>
site of infection. These complexes can be prepared by any of the techniques now<br>
known or subsequently developed for preparing lipid complexes containing<br>
therapeutic agents.<br>

crystallizing the crude product using 10 ml 3:7 (v/v) chloroform : pet-ether. All the<br>
isolated intermediates gave spectroscopic data in agreement with their assigned<br>
structures.<br>
'H-NMR of amphiphile 5 (200 MHz, CDCl3):8/ppm = 0.90 [6H, t, x2- CHj]; 1.20-<br>
1.45 [56H, m, 28x- CH^]; 1.90-2.00 [4H, m, 2x-CH=CH-CH2]; 3.40-3.75 [8H, m, 4x-<br>
N- CHz]; 4.05-4.20 [2H, m, -CH-OH]; 4.75-4.80 [1H, m, -CH-OH]; 5.20-5.40 [1H, m,<br>
-CH-OH].<br>
Example 6:<br>
Cell Transfection. COS-1 cells were seeded at a density of 15,000 cells/well in a 96-<br>
well plate eighteen hours before the transfection. 0.15 fig of plasmid DNA was<br>
complexed with varying amount of lipid (0.05 - 4.3 nmoles) in 13 (4.1 of plain DMEM<br>
medium for 30 min. The charge ratios were varied from 0.1 : 1 to 9 : 1 (+/-) over this<br>
range of the lipid. The complex was diluted to 100 ul with plain DMEM and added to<br>
the wells. After 3 h of incubation, 100 ul of DMEM with 10 % PCS was added to the<br>
cells The medium was changed to 10 % complete medium after 24 h and the reporter<br>
gene activity was estimated after 48 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS and<br>
lysed in 50 nl of lysis buffer (0.25 M Tris.HCl, pH 8.0 and 0.5% NP40). Care was<br>
taken to ensure complete lysis. The P-galactosidase activity per well was estimated<br>
by adding 50 nl of 2X substrate solution (1.33 mg/ml of ONPG, 0.2 M sodium<br>
phosphate, pH 7.15 and 2 mM magnesium chloride) to the lysate in a 96-well plate.<br>
Absorption at 405 nm was converted to P-galactosidase units by using calibration<br>
curve constructed with pure commercial P-galactosidase enzyme.<br>
The values of P-galactosidase units in replicate plates assayed on the same day varied<br>
by less than 30 %. The transfection efficiency values reported were average values<br>
from four replicate transfection plates assayed on the same day. Each transfection<br>
experiment was repeated three times on three different days and the day-to-day<br>
variation in average transfection efficiency values for identically treated replicate<br>
transfection plates was 2-3 fold and was dependent on the cell density and conditions<br>
of the cells. Figure 1 shows representative transfection results obtained with cationic<br>
lipids 1-5. As shown in Figure 1, the in vitro ;ction efficiency of cationic lipid 2<br>
is comparable to or better than that of DMRIE, one of the most extensively used<br>
commercially available cationic transfection lipids used in in vitro gene delivery.<br>
Example 7:<br>
Lipid:DNA Interactions Assay. Intercalation-induced fluorescence increase and<br>
competition with cationic Hpids to bind to DNA has made Ethidium Bromide (EtBr)<br>
an excellent tool to study cationic lipid-DNA interactions. To assess the representative<br>
lipid:DNA interactions for the cationic lipids of the present invention, we have titrated<br>
the EtBr: pCMV p-gal complex with increasing amounts of cationic lipids 1-5.<br>
The extent of Et.Br binding to the DNA was monitored by the changes in the<br>
fluorescence. EtBr fluorescence was monitored in Hitachi 4500 fluorimeter by setting<br>
the excitation wavelength at 518 nm and emission wavelength at 585 nm. To one ml<br>
of TE buffer (pH 8.0), 0.78 nmoles of DNA and 2.5 nmoles of EtBr were added. The<br>
change in fluorescence was monitored after adding small volumes of lipids 1-5 to the<br>
EtBrDNA complex. Arbitrary fluorescence values were recorded after allowing<br>
sufficient time for equilibration. The order of addition of EtBr or lipid to DNA did<br>
not alter the final values indicating that the equilibrium does not depend on the order<br>
of addition and reaches in minutes. Percent fluorescence was calculated considering<br>
the fluorescence value in the absence of lipid as 100.<br>
The data in Figure 2 shows that lipids 1,4 and 5 interact poorly with DNA as seen by<br>
their relatively poor ability to exclude ethidium bromide from DNA. Lipids 2 and 3<br>
interact with DNA equally well up to lipid:DNA ratio of 1.25 or so (Figure 2). The<br>
decrease in EtBr fluorescence at charge ratios of 3:1 was greater than 80 % with all<br>
the lipids 1-5. Taken together the transfection results shown in Figure 1 and the<br>
lipid:DNA interaction profiles shown in Figure 2, it seems that strong lipid:DNA<br>
interactions for the presently described cationic lipids results into better intracellular<br>
gene delivery.<br>
Example 8:<br>
Toxicity Assays. An MTT based viability assay was performed to assess the<br>
cytotoxicity of lipids 1-5 at various lipid:DNA charge ratios with COS-1 cells as<br>
described previously (Banerjee, R. et al. 1999). Except lipid 1, all the other lipids (2-<br>
5) showed least cytotoxicity even at a 9:1 lipid:DNA charge ratio (Figure 3). For<br>
lipias 1, 4 and 5 at a 3:1 charge ratio the toxicity varied from 15-25 % of the ueated<br>
cells. The toxicity of lipid 2 (with shorter alkyl chains) may originate from its<br>
probable detergent-like cell-lysing activity. As shown in Figure 3, the cellular<br>
toxicity profiles of lipids 2-5 of the present invention are better than those of several<br>
commercially available cationic transfection lipids including lipofectin, lipofectAmine<br>
and DMRIE.<br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
