				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
(The present invention relates to Benzophenone linked pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4] benzodiazepine hybrids and a process for the preparation thereof. More particularly it relates to 7-methoxy-8-{n-[2-benzoyl-(4-chlorophenyloxy)alkyl]oxy}-(11aS)-1,2,3,11a-tetrahydro-5H-pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4] benzodiazepine-5-one with aliphatic chain length variations useful as anticancer (antitumour) agent. )The structural formula of these Benzophenone linked pyrrolo [2,1-c][1,4] benzodiazepines hybrids is given below.<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Pyrrolo [2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine antitumour antibiotics are commonly known as anthramycin class of compounds. In the last few years, a growing interest has been shown in the development of new pyrrolo [2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines (PBDs). These antibiotics react covalently with DNA to form an N2-guanine adduct that lies within the minor groove of duplex DNA via an acid-labile aminal bond to the electrophilic imine at the N10-C11 position (Kunimoto, S.; Masuda, T.; Kanbayashi, N.; Hamada, M.; Naganawa, H.; Miyamoto, M.; Takeuchi, T.; Unezawa, H. J. Antibiot, 1980, 33, 665.; Kohn, K. W. and Speous, C. L. J. Mol. Biol., 1970, 51, 551.; Hurley, L. H.; Gairpla, C. and Zmijewski, M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta., 1977, 475, 521.; Kaplan, D. J. and Hurley, L. H. Biochemistry, 1981, 20, 7572). The molecules have a right-handed twist, which allows them to follow the curvature of the minor groove of B-form double-stranded DNA spanning three base pairs. A recent development has been the linking of two PBD units through their C-8 positions to give bisfunctional-alkylating agents capable of cross-linking DNA (Thurston, D. E.; Bose,<br>
D. S.; Thomson, A. S.; Howard, P. W.; Leoni, A.; Croker, S. J.; Jenkins, T. C.; Neidle, S. and Hurley, L. H. J. Org. Chem. 1996, 61, 8141).<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Anthramycin dimers; n = 3-5<br>
Recently, PBD dimers have been developed that comprise of two C2-exo-methylene substituted DC-81 subunits tethered through their C-8 position via an inert propanedioxy linker (Gregson, S. J.; Howard, P. W.; Hartely, J. A.; Brooks, N. A.; Adams, L. J.; Jenkins, T. C.; Kelland, L. R. and Thurston, D. E. J. Med. Chem. 2001, 44, 737). A non-cross-linking mixed imine-amide PBD dimers have been synthesized that have significant DMA binding ability and potent antitumour activity (Kama), A.; Ramesh, G. Laxman, N.; Ramulu, P.; Srinivas, 0.; Neelima, K.; Kondapi, A. K.; Srinu, V. B.; Nagarajaram, H. M. J. Med. Chem. 2002, 45, 4679). Recently, some new<br>
pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) hybrids have been synthesized that have significant DNA binding ability and potent antitumour activity.( Kamal, A.; Srinivas, O.; Ramulu, P.; Ramesh, G.; Kumar, P. P. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2003, 13, 3577).<br>
Naturally occurring pyrrolo [2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines belong to a group of antitumour antibiotics derived from Streptomyces species. Recently, there is much impetus for the PBD systems as they can recognize and bind to specific sequence of DNA. Examples of naturally occurring PBDs include anthramycin, DC-81, tomaymycin, sibiromycin and neothramycin.<br>
However, the clinical efficacy for these antibiotics is hindered by several limitations, such as poor water solubility, cardio toxicity, development of drug resistance and metabolic inactivation.<br>

The main objective of the present invention is to provide Novel Benzophenone pyrrolo [2,1-c] [1,4]benzodiazepine hybrids, useful as antitumour agents.<br>

Thermal denaturation studies<br>
Compounds were subjected to thermal denaturation studies with duplex-form calf thymus DNA (CT-DNA) using an adaptation of a reported procedure. Working solutions in aqueous buffer (10 mM NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, 1 mM Na2EDTA, pH 7.00+0.01) containing CT-DNA (100 μrn in phosphate) and the PBD (20 μm) were prepared by addition of concentrated PBD solutions in DMSO to obtain a fixed [PBD]/[DNA] molar ratio of 1:5. The DNA-PBD solutions were incubated at 37 °C for 0, 18, and 36 h prior to analysis. Samples were monitored at 260 nm using a Beckman DU-7400 spectrophotometer fitted with high performance temperature controller, and heating was applied at 1 °C min-1 in the 40-90 °C range. DNA helix coil transition temperatures (Tm) were obtained from the maxima in the (dA260)/dT<br><br>
derivative plots. Results are given as the mean ± standard deviation from three determinations and are corrected for the effects of DMSO co-solvent using a linear correction term. Drug-induced alterations in DMA melting behaviour are given by: ATm=Tm(DNA+PBD)-Tm (DNA alone), where the Tm value for the PBD-free CT-DNA is 69.0 ± 0.01. The fixed [PBD]/[DNA] ratio used did not result in binding saturation of the host DNA duplex for any compound examined.Compound 5a, 5b, 5g 5i and 5j at 0 hr,18 hr and 36 hr gradually increased at 37°C.
