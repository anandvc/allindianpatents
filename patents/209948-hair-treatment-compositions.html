HAIR TREATMENT COMPOSITIONS<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
GRANTED<br>
25-7-2007<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to hair treatment compositions.  More particularly the invention relates to hair treatment compositions comprising specific combinations of active materials.  The compositions are particularly suitable for application to hair for repair and restoration of damaged hair.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
Hair can suffer damage from a number of sources such as; exposure to UV and chlorine; chemical influences such as bleaching, perming, overly frequent washing with harsh surfactant-based cleansing shampoo compositions; and mechanical influences such as prolonged use of heated styling appliances.<br>
Damage to the hair typically manifests itself in cuticle and protein loss from the hair fibre, hair fibre brittleness and breakage and frayed or split ends.<br>
In addition consumers require their hair to be manageable; that is that the hair when styled will retain that style for a long period of time and in a range of environmental detrimental conditions such as high humidity.<br>

Fatty Materials<br>
Conditioner compositions of the invention preferably additionally comprise fatty materials-  The combined use of fatty materials and cationic surfactants in conditioning compositions is believed to be especially advantageous, because this leads to the formation of a structured phase, in which the cationic surfactant is dispersed.<br>

The long chain acyl derivative is desirably selected from ethylene glycol stearate, alkanolamides of fatty acids having from 16 to 22 carbon atoms and mixtures thereof.  Ethylene glycol distearate and polyethylene glycol 3 distearate are preferred long chain acyl derivatives.  Polyacrylic acid is available commercially as Carbopol 420, Carbopol 488 or Carbopol 493. Polymers of acrylic acid cross-linked -with a polyfunctional agent may also be used; they are available commercially as Carbopol 910, Carbopol 934, Carbopol 941 and Carbopol 980.

(ii)   Non-silicone Oily Conditioning Components<br>
Compositions according to the present invention may also comprise a dispersed, non-volatile, water-insoluble oily conditioning agent.<br>
By "insoluble" is meant that the material is not soluble in water (distilled or equivalent) at a concentration of 0.1% (w/w), at 25°C.<br>
Suitable oily or fatty materials are selected from hydrocarbon oils, fatty esters and mixtures thereof. Straight chain hydrocarbon oils will preferably contain from about 12 to about 30 carbon atoms.  Also suitable are polymeric hydrocarbons of alkenyl monomers, such as C2-C6 alkenyl monomers.<br>
Specific examples of suitable hydrocarbon oils include paraffin oil, mineral oil, saturated and unsaturated dodecane, saturated and unsaturated tridecane, saturated and unsaturated tetradecane, saturated and unsaturated<br><br><br><br><br>
24<br><br><br><br>
pentadecane, saturated and unsaturated hexadecane, and mixtures thereof.  Branched-chain isomers of these compounds, as well as of higher chain length hydrocarbons, can also be used.<br>
Suitable fatty esters are characterised by having at least 10 carbon atoms, and include esters with hydrocarbyl chains derived from fatty acids or alcohols, Monocarboxylic acid esters include esters of alcohols and/or acids of the formula R'COOR in which R* and R independently denote alkyl or alkenyl radicals and the sum of carbon atoms in R' and R is at least 10, preferably at least 20.  Di- and trialkyl and alkenyl esters of carboxylic acids can also be used.<br>
Particularly preferred fatty esters are mono-, di- and triglycerides, more specifically the mono-, di-, and tri-esters of glycerol and long chain carboxylic acids such as C3.-C22 carboxylic acids. Preferred materials include cocoa butter, palm stearin, sunflower oil, soyabean oil and coconut oil.<br>
25<br><br>
The oily or fatty material is suitably present at a level of from 0.05 to 10, preferably from 0.2 to 5, more preferably from about 0.5 to 3-wt%.<br>
In hair treatment compositions containing a conditioning agent, it is preferred that a cationic polymer also be present.<br>
Styling polymers<br>
If the product is a styling product it is preferred if a styling polymer is present<br>
The hair styling polymer if present is preferably present in the compositions of the invention in an amount of from 0.001% to 10% by weight, more preferably from 0.1% to 10% by weight, such as from 1% to 8% by weight.<br>
Hair styling polymers are well known. Suitable hair styling polymers include commercially available polymers that contain moieties that render the polymers cationic, anionic, amphoteric or nonionic in nature. Suitable hair styling polymers include, for example, block and graft copolymers. The polymers may be synthetic or naturally derived.<br>
