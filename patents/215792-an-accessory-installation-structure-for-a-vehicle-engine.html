				<td>Detailed Description of the Embodiment]<br>
[Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to an accessory installation structure for a vehicle engine.<br>
[Related Art]<br>
One example of an accessory installation structure for a vehicle    engine is "a circulation pump apparatus for a water-cooled type vehicle<br>
       engine" disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. Hei  1- foreignspsuoulet be heplead by Indian guivatents<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 and 2 of the above publication, an intermediate<br>
 'snaft 13 (note that all reference numbers used in this section are the same<br>
        as those used in the above publication) driven by a crankshaft 10 of an<br>
engine 1 is disposed in a crank case 1, and is connected at each end to accessories, i.e., a lubricating oil pump 15 and a cooling water pump 17, respectively. The lubricating oil pump 15 is located inside a transmission case 5 and the cooling water pump 17 is located behind and projecting from a generator 12 in a width direction of the vehicle.<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In the above conventional technique, the cooling water -17 is placed to project widthwise from the generator 12, thereby increasing the size of the vehicle.<br>
Also, since those accessories actuated by the crankshaft 10 are used continuously, it is likely that the accessories will reach a relatively high temperature. To combat this, it is necessary, for example, to regulate the temperature of the lubricating oil pump 15 so as not to exceed a predetermined temperature.<br>
Therefore, an object  of the  present  invention is  to improve  an<br><br>
arrangement of such accessories and to enhance cooling efficiency of the continuously-used accessories cooled by air during running.<br>
[Means for Solving Problem]<br>
The present invention relates to an accessory installation structure for a vehicle engine in which a cover, consisting of a flange section and a generator accommodating section projecting from the flange section, covers a generator which is driven by a crankshaft of the engine and disposed outside of a crank case, wherein characterized in that an intermediate shaft driven by said crankshaft is provided straddling said crank case and said flange section so that one end of the intermediate shaft projects from said flange section, whereby an accessory, such as an oil pump, is attached to said one end of the intermediate shaft. . ' â€¢<br>
The above object is achieved by the present invention according to claim 1, in which a cover, consisting of a flange section and a generator accommodating section projecting from the flange section, covers a generator driven by a crankshaft of the engine and disposed outside of a crank case in a vehicle, wherein an intermediate shaft driven by the crankshaft is provided straddling the crank case and the flange section so that -one end of the intermediate shaft projects from the flange section, whereby an accessory, such as an oil pump, is attached to the one end of the intermediate shaft.<br>
In this arrangement, the accessories can be disposed in a free space of the cover covering the generator, which prevents the width wise projection of the accessories. In addition, the accessories can be cooled by the air flowing along the cover.<br>
In the invention according to claim 2, a wind guiding member for guiding air during running to the accessory is attached to the cover.<br>
The air flowing around the cover is guided to the accessories along the air guiding member to cool the accessories.<br>
In the invention according to claim 3, the air guiding member also functions as a guard member for protecting the accessories from the impact of foreign objects hitting on the accessories.<br>
Even if some foreign objects bounce around or obstacles exist on a road surface, the air guiding member acts as a guard member to protect the accessories from the impact of such foreign objects or obstacles.<br><br>
In the invention according to claim 4, in a vehicle engine including a primary accessoiy which is used continuously, such as an oil pump, and a secondary accessory which is used briefly, the primary and secondary accessories are disposed below and outside the center of a crank case, with the primaiy accessory disposed ahead of a crankshaft and the secondary accessory disposed behind the crankshaft.<br>
The temperature of the primary accessory used continuously tends to rise higher than the temperature of the secondary accessory used only briefly. To combat this, the air during running can flow without being interrupted by the secondary accessory and cools the primary accessory. Also, the center of gravity of the vehicle can be lowered in this arrangement.<br><br>

In the figure, various attachments to the front cover 21, the inner cover 22, the step floors 23, the center cover 26, and the fuel tank 8 are not shown.<br>
Cooling air paths 58, 58 are formed inside the body cover 17 to guide cooling air Fc (including the running air generated during the movement of<br>
the vehicle) introduced from the front of the vehicle, in a backward direction. The radiator 10 and right and left guide plates 59, 59 for guiding the cooling air Fc to the radiator 10 are arranged in the cooling air paths 58, 58.<br>
The vehicle accessories including the fuel tank 8, the reserve tank 9, and the fuel pump 56 (see Fig. 2) are disposed in front of the radiator 10 in the cooling air paths 58, 58.<br>
The right and left floor skirts 24, 24 have air inlets 24a, 24a for introducing the cooling air Fi (including the running air generated during the movement of the vehicle) to the interior of the vehicle from the side. The cooling air Fi introduced from the wind inlets 24a, 24a flows backward along the side of the engine 11.<br>
The fuel tank 8 and the radiator 10 are placed in the middle of the width of the vehicle, and a distance between right and left down tubes 2a, 2a in the body frame 2 is larger than the width of the fuel tank 8 or the width of the radiator 10. In this arrangement, the fuel tank 8 and the radiator 10 are protected by the down tubes 2a, 2a.<br>
A main pipe 2b is placed in the longitudinal center of the body and has a generally Y shape when seen from above, but the rear portion of the main pipe is not shown in this figure.<br>
Fig. 4 is an exploded sectional view of the power unit generally along a line 4-4 of Fig. 2.<br>
The power unit 12 includes the engine 11 disposed in the middle widthwise of the vehicle, a power transmission mechanism 72 provided on the left side for transmitting power of the engine 11 to a rear wheel axle 71, and a generator 73 provided on the right side.<br>
Specifically, the engine 11 is a single cylinder two cycle engine which mainly consists of a crank case 61 formed by fastening left and right halves 61A, 61B of the crank case with bolts, a cylinder block 62, a cylinder head 63, a crankshaft 64, a connecting rod 65, and a piston 66.<br>
The left half 61A of the crank case functions as a case of the transmission mechanism for accommodating the power transmission mechanism 72, which extends backward with its left opening covered by a case cover 74. Accordingly, a first space section Si is formed between the left half 61A and the case cover 74.<br>
The power transmission mechanism 72 is a belt type power transmission mechanism in which a driving pulley 75 attached to the left end of the crankshaft 64 is connected with a driven pulley, which is not shown, by a V belt 76. The driving pulley 75 has air cooled fins 75a... which introduce the outside air through an air filter 77 to cool the interior of the first space section SI.<br>
Fig. 5 is an enlarged sectional view showing the major components of the power unit of Fig. 4 around the crankshaft and the generator according to the present invention.<br>
The generator 73 is driven by the crankshaft 64 and is located outside the crank case 61. Specifically, the generator 73 is attached to the right end of the crankshaft 64 projecting from the right half 61B of the crank case.<br>
The generator 73 projecting from crank case 61 is covered by a generator cover 78 which is formed by a flange section 78a which is fastened with bolts to the right half 6 IB and a generator accommodating section 78b<br>
projecting from the flange section 78a.<br>
An intermediate shaft 83 driven by the crankshaft 64 straddles the right half 61B and the flange section 78a, and accessories of the vehicle are attached to the intermediate shaft 83. Specifically, an extension 61Ba is formed integrally with the right half 61B of the crank case to extend perpendicularly to the crankshaft 64, whereby the intermediate shaft 83 is supported by the extension 61Ba and the flange section 78a via bearings 81, 82, respectively.<br>
An accessory actuating mechanism 84 is arranged in a second space section S2 surrounded by the right half 61B, the extension 6lBa, and the cover 78. The accessory actuating mechanism 84 is a belt type actuating mechanism in which an accessory driving pulley 85 attached to the crankshaft 64 is connected with an accessory driven pulley 86 attached to the intermediate shaft 83 with a timing belt 87 made of rubber or the like.<br>
The intermediate shaft 83 is supported by the right half 6 1B and the flange section 78a, and the accessory driven pulley 86 is located in the middle of the intermediate shaft 83. This arrangement ensures a high supporting rigidity of the intermediate shaft 83.<br>
Since there is only a small distance between the crankshaft 64 and the intermediate shaft 83, no side guide for guiding timing belt 87 is provided on either side of the accessory driving pulley 85. Accordingly, the timing belt 87 receives less side pressure from the pulley axis side when the timing belt 87 is in mesh with a groove of the accessory driving pulley 85. This increases durability of the belt.<br>
The intermediate shaft 83 has an oil pump (a lubricating oil pump)<br>
88 attached to one end and a cooling water pump 89 attached to the other end. The oil pump 88 and the cooling water pump 89 are engine accessories which are continuously used during the operation of the engine 11. Such continuously used engine accessories are herein called primary accessories.<br>
Specifically, one end of the intermediate shaft 83 is projecting from the flange section 78a and removably connected to an axis 88a of the oil pump 88 which is fastened to the outer surface of the flange section 78a with a bolt 88f via a heat insulating plate 88e.<br>
The generator cover 78 is formed by enlarging the flange section 78a to accommodate the accessory actuating mechanism 84 by cooperating with the extension 6lBa. Since the oil pump 88 is attached to this enlarged flange section 78a, the oil pump 88 is accommodated in a free space around the cover 78. Thus, the widthwise projection of the oil pump 88 can be prevented.<br>
The flange section 78a of the cover 78 has a window guiding member 90 fastened with a bolt to guide the air to the oil pump 88. The air guiding member 90 will be described later.<br>
The other end of the intermediate shaft 83 is inserted into a pump case section 89a formed in the extension 61Ba and is coupled with a rotor (an impeller) 89b. The pump case section 89a is covered by a cover 89d having an inlet port 89c. The cover 89d also has a sub-inlet port 89e. A reference numeral 89f indicates a mechanical seal.<br>
Fig. 6 is a sectional view of the components around the crankshaft and the generator according to the present invention when seen from another direction, in which the crankshaft 64 is connected to a starter motor 91.<br>
Specifically, the starter motor 91 is an engine accessory that is used only briefly when the engine 11 is started. Such a briefly used accessory is herein called a secondary accessory.<br>
The starter motor 91 is fastened with bolts to the extension 61Ba of the right half 6 1B of the case and is connected to the crankshaft 64 via a gear mechanism 91a which is covered by the generator cover 78.<br>
Fig. 7 is a sectional view of the components around the crankshaft and the generator according to the present invention when seen from still another direction.<br>
In operation, the generator 73 generates heat which often raises the temperature of the second space section S2 to be higher than the temperature of the first space section S1. The high temperature of the second space section S2 may adversely affect the durability of the timing belt 87 made of rubber or the like. To decrease the temperature of the second space section S2, the first and second space sections S1 and S2 are rendered to communicate with each other via air communicating paths S3, S4 of the crank case 61.<br>
With this arrangement, when there is a temperature difference between the first and second space sections S1 and S2, air within the space sections S1, S2 is exchanged gradually through the air communicating paths S3, S4 provided in the left and right halves 61A and 61B to decrease the temperature of the second space section S2. Thus, the durability of the timing belt 87 made of rubber or the like can be improved.<br>
Fig. 8 is a sectional view showing the left side of major components of the engine (with the left half of the crank case removed) according to the present invention.<br>
The engine 11 includes a scavenging port 11a and an exhaust port 11b, both communicating with a cylinder 62a. In response to the ascending movement of the piston 66, a negative pressure is generated within the crank case 61 to open a reed valve 92, whereby a mixture is introduced from a carburetor described below through an inlet pipe 93. On the contrary, as the piston 66 descends, the mixture in the crank case 61 is compressed and supplied to the cylinder 62a through the scavenging port lla. The exhaust port 11b has a valve 94 for changing a sectional area of the exhaust channel.<br>
A delivery port 89g of the cooling water pump 89 communicates with an overflow 11c through a water-cooled jacket 61a of the crank case 61, a water-cooled jacket 62b of the cylinder block 62, a water-cooled jacket 63a of the cylinder head 63, and a thermostat 95. The water-cooled jacket 63a of the cylinder head 63 has a sub delivery port 63b.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, an air discharging port 63c of the cylinder head 63 is connected to the filler cap 53 via an air discharging hose 67.<br>
An ignition plug 96 is also shown in the figure.<br>
Fig. 9 shows the left side of the power unit (with the case cover removed) according to the present invention, in which a carburetor 97 is mounted on the inlet pipe 93 of the engine 11.<br>
The cooling water pump 89 functions to suck portions of the cooled water flowing through the water-cooled jacket 63a of the cylinder head 63 via the sub delivery port 63b of the cylinder head 63, a first hose 98A, a jacket of the carburetor 97, a second hose 98B, and the sub-inlet port 89e. As a result, the carburetor 97 is warmed by heated water which is heated after cooling the cylinder.<br>
A brake 99 is also shown in the figure.<br>
Fig. 10 is a schematic view of a combustion control system of an engine according to the present invention.<br>
In a combustion control system 101, a rotational speed of the crankshaft 64 and an opening of the carburetor are input to a control unit 102 which, in turn, adjusts the sectional area of the exhaust channel at the exhaust port lib to correspond to the operational state of the engine 11.<br>
A control signal from the control unit 102 is supplied to a control motor 103 which may be formed by a servo motor. The control motor 1C 3 controls the valve 94 for changing a sectional area of the exhaust channel via control cables 103a, 103a and a valve controlling member 104. Specifically, the control motor 103 controls the valve 94 so that the valve is closed when the crankshaft 94 rotates at a low speed.<br>
A battery 105 and an ignition switch 106 are also shown in the figure.<br>
A muffler 108 has two metal catalyzers 108a, 108a arranged along a direction of exhaust to increase exhaust purifying efficiency.<br>
Figs. 11 (a) and (b) show configurations of the valve for changing a sectional area of the exhaust channel according to the present invention, in which (a) is a sectional view in the vicinity of the valve and (b) shows a structure of (a) when seen from the direction of an arrow b.<br>
As shown in (a), the valve 94 for changing a sectional area of the exhaust channel is a butterfly damper type valve having a damper plate 94b fixed to its rotational axis 94a. One end of the rotational axis 94a is connected to a valve operating member 104 which is coupled with a control<br>
cable 103a.<br>
As shown in (b), the damper plate 94b has notches 94c, 94c formed on opposite ends of the plate along a direction of rotation. Even if the valve 94 for changing a sectional area of the exhaust channel is completely closed, a minimum amount of air can be exhausted from a gap between the notches 94c, 94c and the exhaust port 11b. Thus, it is possible to secure the minimum amount of exhaust accurately.<br>
Fig. 12 is a side view showing the left side arrangement of the control motor and the valve for changing a sectional area of the exhaust channel according to the present invention, in which a control motor 103 is placed in the rear part of the vehicle distanced from the engine 11 having a relatively high temperature.<br>
Specifically, a hanger plate 2c is attached to the right rear portion of a main pipe 2b, and the control motor 103 is fastened to the hanger plate 2c with bolts. Since the control motor 103 is distanced from the section including the engine 11, it is easy to protect the control motor 103 from heat or vibration of the engine 11, and to thereby maintain a given durability of the control motor 103.<br>
It is to be noted that a rear cushion 14 is attached to the left rear part 2d of the main pipe.<br>
Fig. 13 is a side view showing the right side of the engine (with the generator cover removed) according to the present invention.<br>
The generator 73 includes a pickup sensor 73b for sensing a rotational angle of a rotor 73a, with a code 73c of the pickup sensor 73b running externally.<br>
The oil pump 88 connected to the crankshaft 64 (see Fig. 5) and the starter motor 91 are arranged below and outside the center O of the crank case 61 (or the center of the crankshaft 64). The oil pump 88 is located in front of the crankshaft 64, while the starter motor 91 is located behind the crankshaft 64. Thus, the oil pump 88 and the starter motor 91 can be disposed in a narrow space surrounding the engine 11 of the motorcycle without difficulty and, at the same time, the center of gravity of the motorcycle can be lowered.<br>
In addition, the running air cools the oil pump 88 used continuously without being interrupted by the starter motor 91, whereby the oil pump 88 which tends to have a relatively high temperature can be cooled sufficiently.<br>
As shown in phantom lines, since the exhaust pipe 107 runs in the vicinity of the intermediate shaft 83, it is necessary to not raise the temperature of the oil pump 88 connected to the intermediate shaft 83 (see Fig. 5) because of heat from the exhaust pipe 107. This is achieved by the present invention in which the oil pump 88 can be sufficiently cooled by the running air. Also, a heat insulating protector 107b and a heat insulating member 109, which are described below, serve to prevent heat transmission from the exhaust pipe 107 to the oil pump 88.<br>
Fig. 14 is a side view showing the right side of the power unit according to the present invention, in which a portion of the oil pump 88 is surrounded by a front wall 90a, an upper wall 90b and a rear wall 90c of the wind guiding member 90.<br>
The oil pump 88 is coupled with a manipulating cable 88a for manipulating an opening of the built-in valve with a throttle grip which is not shown. An end portion of a covering tube 88b covering the manipulating<br>
cable 88a, and an oil absorbing hose 88c and an oil discharging hose 88d of the oil pump 88 are attached to the air guiding member 90.<br>
Fig. 15 is a sectional view of the air guiding member according to the present invention for explaining its function.<br>
A rear wall 90c of the air guiding member 90 is wider than a front wall 90a and the oil pump 88.<br>
The air Fi flows backward along the generator cover 78 and cools the oil pump 88. The air Fi is also guided to the oil pump 88 by the air guiding member 90. In other words, the air Fi flows along the wall of the oil pump 88 and is interrupted by the rear wall 90c to make a detour, thereby cooling the oil pump 88.<br>
The air guiding member 90 functions as a guard member, especially at its front and rear walls 90a and 90c, for protecting the oil pump 88 from the impact of foreign objects. For example, a foreign object J bouncing up from a road surface is deflected back by the front and rear walls 90a, 90c. In this way, the air guiding member 90 acts as the guard member to protect the oil pump 88 from such a foreign object J or other obstacles to thereby prevent damage to the oil pump 88.<br>
Figs. 16 (a) and (b) show configurations of an exhaust pipe and a muffler, respectively, according to the present invention, in which (a) is a plan view and (b) shows the left side.<br>
A portion of the exhaust pipe 107 near the oil pump 88 is covered by the heat insulating protector 107b and the heat insulating material 109 to reduce the radiation of heat, whereby the oil pump 88 is less affected by heat. The heat insulating material 109 keeps the temperature of the exhaust pipe<br><br>
107 at a certain level to speed up a response of the metal catalyzers 108a, 108a.<br>
A flange 107b connected to the exhaust port lib of the engine 11, a heat insulating protector 107b, attachment stays 108b, 108c, 108c, and stays for the heat insulating protector 108d, 108e are also shown in the figure.<br>
Two right and left attachment stays 108c, 108c have an identical shape and are attached to the muffler 108 with each stay facing in opposite directions. The heat insulating protectors 108d, 108e are elongated members extending along the muffler 108 for enhancing heat insulating efficiency.<br>
It is worth noting that, in the above embodiment, the primary accessory which is used continuously is not limited to the oil pump 88 or the cooling water pump 89, and the secondary accessory which is used briefly is not limited to the starter motor 91.<br>
[Advantage of the Invention]<br>
With the above structure, the present invention presents the following advantages.<br>
According to the invention defined in claim 1, one end of the intermediate shaft projects from the flange section of the cover of the generator, and accessories are mounted on this projecting end, whereby the accessories are accommodated in a free space around the generator accommodating section which is formed by the projection of the cover. Since those accessories placed in the free space do not project widthwise, they can be arranged in a narrow space around the engine. Thus, the size of the vehicle is minimized, and the accessories are cooled by the air flowing<br><br>
around the cover, which improves cooling efficiency.<br>
According to the invention defined in claim 2, the guiding member of the cover guides the running air flowing along the cover to the accessories,<br>
thereby cooling the accessories more efficiently.<br>
I<br>
According to the invention defined in claim 3, the guiding member functions as a guard member to protect the accessories from the impact of foreign objects bouncing up from the road surface or obstacles on it, thereby preventing damage to the accessories.<br>
According to the invention defined in claim 4, the primary accessory used continuously is disposed in front of the secondary briefly used accessory, whereby the air flows without being interrupted by the secondary accessory to cool the primary accessoiy. Thus, the primary accessory which tends to have a relatively high temperature can be cooled sufficiently by the running air.<br>
Also, the primary and secondary accessories are arranged below and outside the center of the crank case, and each accessory is placed in front of and behind the crankshaft, respectively. As a result, the accessories can be disposed in a narrow space around the engine section of the vehicle, and the center of gravity of the vehicle can be lowered.<br>
