POLYMORPH 10F BILASTINE, PROCESS FOR ITS PREPARATION AND PHARMACEUTICA<br><br><br>
Area of the invention<br>
The invention refers to a new polymorphous crystalline form of 4-[2-[4-[1-(2-ethoxyethyl)-1H-ben2imidazole-2-yl]-1-piperidinyl]ethyl]-aa-dimethyl-benzene-acetic acid (herein referred to as "bilastine") of formula (I).<br><br>
From hereon referred to as polymorph 1, to procedures used to prepare it, to pharmaceutical formulae that contain polymorph 1 and to the use of polymorph 1 to treat allergic reactions and pathological processes mediated by histamine in mammals, such as man.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
US patent number 5,877,187 confers the rights to bilastine, a preparation with antihistaminic properties without sedative or cardiovascular effects. This patent also concerns a procedure to prepare bilastine and the use of this preparation to treat allergic reactions in mammals but it does not include or suggest the possible existence of polymorphic forms of this compound.<br><br>
2<br>
To prepare pharmaceutical preparations containing bilastine for their administration in mammals and especially in man, in accordance with international health authority specifications, bilastine must be manufactured in the most stable crystalline form possible, especially in a form that has constant physical properties.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
We have found that bilastine can exist in three different crystalline polymorphic forms, each with different physical properties.<br>
The invention refers to a pure crystalline form of polymorph 1 of bilastine, characterised by X-ray crystallographic analysis, with approximate crystal parameters as follows:<br>
Crystallographic system	Monoclinic<br>
Spatial group	P2(1)/c<br>
Crystal size	0.56 x 0.45 x 0.24 mm<br>
Cell dimension	a=23.38 (5) A angstrom      = 90°<br>
b=8.829(17)A	=90°<br>
c=12.59(2)A	Y = 90°<br>
Volume	2600 A3<br>
Z, calculated density	4, 1.184 mg/m3<br>
The crystalline polymorph 1 of bilastine is also characterised by its infrared absorption spectrum. in potassium bromide tablet that has the following characteristic absorption bands, expressed in reciprocal centimetres:<br>
3430 (s)*; 3057 (w)*; 2970 (s); 2929 (s); 2883 (m)*; 2857 (m); 2797 (w); 1667 (m); 1614 (m); 1567 (w); 1509 (s); 1481 (m); 1459 (vs)*; 1431 (m); 1378 (w); 1346 (m); 1326 (m); 1288 (w); 1254 (m); 1199 (w); 1157 (w); 1121 (vs); 1045<br><br>
(w); 1020 (w); 1010 (w); 991 (w); 973 (w); 945 (w); 829 (w); 742 (s); 723 (w); 630 (w), * where (w) = weak intensity, (m)= medium intensity, (s) = strong intensity, (vs) = very strong intensity. Figure 1 represents the infrared spectrum of the crystalline polymorph 1 of the biiastine in a potassium bromide tablet recorded in a Perkin Elmer Spectrum One FTIR spectrophotometer.<br>

Detained description of the invention<br>
We have found that bilasfine can exist in three clearly different polymorphic forms called polmorph 1, poiymorph 2 and poiymorph 3.<br><br>
-3A-<br>
The procedure described in US patent no. 5,877,187 generates a mixture of polymorphs 2 and 3 which corresponds to crude bilastine. More in particular, crude bilastine is prepared by hydrolysis of the corresponding benzimidazole (l-(2-ethoxyethyl)-2-[l-(2-(4-(l-(4,4-dimethyl-A2-oxazoline-2-yl)-l-methylethyl) phenyl)-ethyl)piperidme-4-yl]-lH-benzimidazole (la)) with a mineral acid such as HC1 (example 2) or H2SO4. The bilastine so obtained is a crude product having a melting point of 199-201 °C, being the melting point of pure polymorph 2 of 205.2 °C and that of pure polymorph 3 of 197 °C, so that crude bilastine is a mixture of polymorphs 2 and 3 but it does not consist of pure polymorph 2, pure polymorph 3 or a mixture of said pure polymorphs. The inventors of the present invention have discovered experimental conditions and specific solvents to produce clearly different polymorphic forms of bilastine. The crystalline polymorph 1 of pure bilastine is prepared according to the procedures of this invention. The polymorphic forms 1 is most stable at the three isomers and this makes it an ideal candidate for drug formulation. Polymorph 3 is not stable and is difficult to obtain in the pure form. Both polymorph 2 and polymorph 3 are converted into polymorph 1 by the procedures of this invention.<br><br>
4<br>
Polymorph 3 is not very stable and is difficult to obtain in the pure form. Both polymorph 2 and polymorph 3 are converted into polymorph 1 by the procedures of this invention.<br>
Polymorph 1 of bilastine has a melting point of 200.3°C. Polymorph 2 has a melting point of 205.2°C. Polymorph 3 has a melting point of 197.0°C.<br>
The crystalline polymorphic form 1 of bilastine is also characterised by its infrared absorption spectrum in potassium bromide that has the following characteristic absorption bands, expressed in reciprocal centimetres:<br>
3430 (s)*; 3057 (w)*; 2970 (s); 2929 (s); 2883 (m)*; 2857 (m); 2797 (w); 1667 (m); 1614 (m); 1567 (w); 1509 (s); 1481 (m); 1459 (vs)*; 1431 (m);1378 (w); 1346 (m); 1326 (m); 1288 (w); 1254 (m); 1199 (w); 1157 (w); 1121 (vs); 1045 (w); 1020 (w); 1010 (w); 991 (w); 973 (w); 945 (w); 829 (w); 742 (s);.723 (w); 630 (w), * where (w) = weak intensity, (m)= medium intensity, (s) = strong intensity, (vs) = very strong intensity. Figure 1 represents the infrared spectrum of the crystalline polymorph 1 of the bilastine in a potassium bromide tablet recorded in a Perkin Elmer Spectrum One FTIR spectrophotometer.<br>
The crystalline polymorphic form 2 of bilastine is also characterised by its infrared absorption spectrum in potassium bromide that has the following characteristic absorption bands, expressed in reciprocal centimetres:<br>
3429~(s)*; 3053 (w)*; 2970 (s)*; 2932 (s); 2868 (s); 2804 (w); 1699 (m); 1614 (m)*; 1567 (m); 1508 (s); 1461 (vs)*; 1381 (m); 1351 (s); 1331 (m); 1255 (m); 1201 (w); 1156 (m); 1121 (vs); 1048 (w); 995 (w); 823 (w); 767 (w); 744 (s); 724 (w); 630 (w), * where (w) = weak intensity, (m)= medium intensity, (s) = strong intensity, (vs) = very strong intensity. Figure 2 represents the infrared<br><br>
5<br>
spectrum of the crystalline polymorph 2 of bilastine in a potassium bromide tablet recorded in a Perkin Elmer Spectrum One FTIR spectre-photometer.<br>
The crystalline polymorphic form 3 of bilastine is also characterised by its infrared absorption spectrum in potassium bromide that has the following characteristic absorption bands, expressed in reciprocal centimetres:<br>
3430 (s)*; 3053 (w)*; 2970 (s); 2932 (s); 2868 (s); 2804 (w); 1921 (w); 1708 (m)*; 1614 (m); 1568 (m); 1508 (s); 1461 (vs)*; 1380 (m); 1351 (m); 1330 (m); 1271 (m); 1255 (m); 1201 (w); 1156 (m); 1121 (vs); 1048 (w); 995 (w); 823 (m); 767 (w); 744 (s); 724 (w); 630 (w), * where (w) = weak intensity, (m) = medium intensity, (s) = strong intensity, (vs) = very strong intensity. Figure 3 represents the infrared spectrum of the crystalline polymorph 3 of the bilastine in a potassium bromide tablet recorded in a Perkin Elmer Spectrum One FTIR spectrophotometer.<br>
We have discovered that, under selected experimental conditions, the mixture of the polymorphic forms 2 and 3, obtained according to US patent no. 5,877,187, is surprisingly transformed into polymorph 1. We have also discovered that polymorph 1 of bilastine is very stable and is not transformed into any of the other polymorphs 2 and 3. Similarly, under the same experimental conditions, the pure polymorphic form 2 of bilastine is surprisingly transformed into the pure polymorphic form 1. Polymorphic form 3, which is the most unstable, undergoes the same transformation under the same conditions.<br>
Polymorph 1 of bilastine is a very stable polymorph at room temperature and is, therefore, very useful as an active ingredient of a pharmaceutical preparation. Polymorph 1 is also stable when stored at temperatures above room temperature.<br><br>
6<br>
The polymorphic crystalline form 1 of bilastine is characterised by the following data of its X-ray crystallographic analysis as a monocrystal, with crystal parameters of approximately the following values:<br>
Crystallographic system	Monoclinic<br>
Spatial group	P2 (1)/c<br>
Crystal size	0.56 x 0.45 x 0.24 mm<br>
Cell dimension	a=23.38 (5) A angstrom     = 90°<br>
b=8.829(17)A	=90°<br>
c=12.59(2)A	Y = 90°<br>
Volume	2600 A3<br>
Z, calculated density	4, 1.184 mg/m3<br>
During the development of polymorph 1 of bilastine for pharmaceutical preparations, elaborated according to correct manufacturing procedures, we have discovered that crystallization of bilastine (prepared according to the description given in US patent no. 5,877,187) from short chained alcohols, preferably isopropylic alcohol and n-butanol and mixtures thereof, leads to generation of the pure polymorphic form 1 of bilastine with a high yield. Crystallisation from acetone, dimethylsulphoxide, dimethylformamide, acetonitrile and tetrahydrofurane or mixtures thereof also lead to generation of polymorph 1, although with lower yields. It is, therefore, preferable to use the former solvents.<br>
The infrared spectrum of polymorph 1 of bilastine in potassium bromide is characterised by the following bands, absent from polymorphs 2 and 3:<br>
Wavenumber(cm-1)<br>
3057<br>
2929<br>
2883<br><br>

Figure 1 shows the complete infrared spectrum of polymorph 1 of bilastine in potassium bromide, recorded with a Perkin Elmer Spectrum One FTIR spectrophotometer.<br>
Pharmaceutical preparations<br>
Pharmaceutical preparations of this invention can contain, as well as an effective quantity of polymorph 1 of bilastine as an active ingredient as an antiallergic or antihistaminic agent, several pharmaceutically acceptable excipients that can be solid or liquid. The solid pharmaceutical preparations include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets and suppositories. A solid excipient can be one of several substances that act as diluents, aromatising agents, agglutinants or disintegrating agents and an encapsulation material. The powders and tablets preferentially contain from approximately 5 to approximately 20 per cent of the active ingredient. Appropriate solid excipients are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylceliulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, waxes with low melting point, cocoa butter and similar products. The term "preparations" includes<br><br>
8<br>
the formulation of the active ingredient with an excipient for encapsulation to produce a capsule in which the active ingredient (with or without other excipients) is surrounded with the excipient by an encapsulation material. Tablets, powders, cachets and capsules can be used as suitable forms for oral administration. The active ingredient can also be incorporated into a chewing gum that can contain sweeteners, flavorings and colorings as appropriate.<br>
To prepare suppositories, a compound with a low melting point, such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter, is melted and the active ingredient is mixed well and homogeneously dispersed in the mixture with agitation. The homogeneous melted mixture is placed in the appropriate moulds and left to cool until it solidifies.<br>
Liquid preparations include suspensions, solutions and emulsions. An example of these corresponds to aqueous suspensions that can be made by mixing the finely divided active ingredient in water with suspension agents. Aqueous solutions can be prepared by placing the active ingredient in water and adding suitable coloring agents, aromas, stabilising agents, sweeteners, solubilising and thickening agents as appropriate.<br>
Also, topical preparations are considered for nasal, ophthalmic and dermal use. Appropriate formulae for nasal administration can correspond to solutions or suspensions. Ophthalmic formulae can be solutions, suspensions or ointments. Dermal preparations can be solutions, suspensions, ointments and creams. Ointments usually contain lipophylic excipients such as mineral oil or vaseline. Solutions for ophthalmic use can contain sodium chloride, acid and/or base to adjust the pH, and purified water and preservatives.<br><br>
9<br>
Similarly, a compound is being contemplated for transdermic use, consisting of a therapeutically effective amount of active ingredient incorporated into an excipient that corresponds to a liquid, a gel, a solid matrix or an adhesive patch sensitive to pressure, to be released via a transdermic administration system.<br>
The effective antiallergic or antihistaminic amount of polymorph 1 of bilastine for topical administration varies between 0.1 and 5% of the total weight of the pharmaceutical compound. The preferred amount ranges from 0.1 to 2% of the total weight of the pharmaceutical compound.<br>
The effective antiallergic or antihistaminic amount of polymorph 1 of bilastine for oral administration varies from 1 to 50 mg/day, with preferably an amount corresponding to approximately 2 to 20 mg/day in a single or fractionated doses.<br>
Polymorph 1 of bilastine has antihistaminic. properties that have been demonstrated in experimental pharmacological models, such as preventing histamine-induced lethality in the guinea-pig and antagonism against cutaneous capillary permeability induced by histamine in the rat.<br>
The following examples illustrate but do not limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
