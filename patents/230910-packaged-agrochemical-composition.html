				<td>PACKAGED AGROCHEMICAL COMPOSITION<br>
The present invention relates to a packaged agrochemical composition comprising a water-soluble, agrochemically active ingredient, the composition being packaged in a water-soluble or water-dispersible sachet.<br>
A gel (comprising a hazardous product, a surfactant, an acrylic acid polymer or copolymer and water) which is suitable for packaging in a water-soluble sachet is disclosed in WO92/01377. An aqueous composition, comprising a hazardous product, an electrolyte and water and packaged in a water-soluble bag, is disclosed in EP-A1-0518689. It has been found that, when the aqueous compositions of the prior art are packaged in water-soluble sachets (such as sachets made from polyvinyl alcohol), water from the composition permeates through the wall of the sachet. The water that permeates can affect the outer surface of the sachet (for example by causing the bag to dissolve or adhere to the secondary packaging) and, thereby, reduce the shelf-life of the packaged product.<br>
Water-soluble films comprising a barrier coating are disclosed in US3186869, US3322674 and GB-954602, whilst water-soluble films comprising a layer of particulate inert plastics material having high water repellency are disclosed in EP-A2-0079248.<br>
The present invention provides an agrochemical composition packaged in a water-soluble or water-dispersible sachet, the agrochemical composition comprising a water-soluble, agrochemically active ingredient, water and an agent to minimise water loss through the walls of the sachet.<br>
In one aspect the present invention provides an agrochemical composition packaged in a water-soluble sachet, the agrochemical composition comprising a water-soluble, agrochemically active ingredient, water and an agent to minimise water loss through the walls of the sachet.<br>
In a further aspect the present invention provides an agrochemical composition packaged in a water-soluble or water-dispersible sachet obtained by packing a composition comprising a water-soluble, agrochemically active ingredient, water and an agent to minimise water loss through the walls of the sachet in a water-soluble or water-dispersible sachet.<br>
The agent to minimise water loss through the walls of the sachet is, for example, an alkyl, alkenyl, aryl or arylalkyl acid or a salt or ester thereof; an ester of a naturally occurring oil; a mineral or synthetic oil; an alcohol, an ether of an alcohol or a glyceride.   It is preferred<br>
that the agent is an ester of an alkyl, alkenyl, aryl or arylalkyl acid; an ester of a naturally occurring oil; or a mineral or synthetic oil.<br>
Aryl, and the aryl moiety of arylalkyl, is, preferably, phenyl. Aryl (especially phenyl) is optionally substituted with alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, phenylalkyl, phenylalkenyl or phenylalkynyl.<br>
Alkyl groups are straight or branched chain and preferably contain from 1 to 24 carbon atoms. Alkyl is, for example, octyl, nonyl, decyl or dodecyl.<br>
The alkyl group of arylalkyl or phenylalkyl is straight or branched chain and preferably contains from 1 to 20 (for example 1 to 10) carbon atoms.<br>
Alkenyl groups, and the alkenyl moiety of phenylalkenyl, are straight or branched chains and preferably contain from 2 to 24, especially from 10 to 20, carbon atoms and 1, 2 or 3 double bonds. Alkenyl is, for example, stearyl, linolenyl, linolyl, licosenyl, erucyl, palmitolyl, oleyl or undecenyl.<br>
Alkynyl groups, and the alkynyl moiety of phenylalkynyl, are straight or branched chains and preferably contain from 2 to 24, especially from 10 to 20, carbon atoms and 1, 2 or 3 triple bonds.<br>
Suitable acid groups include carboxylic acids and sulphonic acids.<br>
Salts include alkali metal salts such as sodium or potassium salts.<br>
Esters include alkyl esters.<br>
Naturally occurring oils include oils extracted from plants, seeds, nuts animals or fish and these are, for example, canola, sunflower or peanut oil. Such oils are, essentially, mixtures of esters of several unsaturated carboxylic acids. For example, sunflowerate includes esters of CIS unsaturated carboxylic acids. Other naturally occurring oils include derivatives of stearic, linolenic, linolic, licosenic, erucic, palmitic, oleic or undecenic acid.<br>
Mineral oils include paraffin oils. Suitable mineral oils include, for example, ISOPAR速 M or EXXSOL速-D110 (both available from EXXON), or SUNSPRAY速 6N or SUNSPRAY速 1 IN (both available from Sun Lubricants Limited, UK).<br>
Synthetic oils include oils comprising C6-24 alkyl, C6-24 alkenyl or a fatty acid derivative (such as a derivative (especially an ester, such as a C1-6 alkyl ester) of stearic, linolenic, linolic, licosenic, erucic, palmitic, oleic or undecenic acid).<br>
Alcohols include straight or branched chain alcohols (such as glycerols) while ethers of alcohols include ethers of oleyl alcohol.<br>
The water-soluble agrochemically active ingredient, is, for example, a herbicide (such as a paraquat salt (for example paraquat dichloride or paraquat bis(methylsulphate), a diquat salt (for example diquat dibromide or diquat alginate) or glyphosate or a salt or ester thereof (such as glyphosate isopropylammonium, glyphosate sesquisodium or glyphosate trimesium (also known as sulfosate)), an insecticide or a fungicide. It is preferred that the water-soluble agrochemical is paraquat dichloride, diquat dibromide, glyphosate isopropylammonium or glyphosate trimesium (also known as sulfosate).<br>
An electrolyte can be added to the composition to increase its ionic strength. The electrolyte helps to improve the insolubility of the material from which the sachet is made in the composition. (See Polyvinyl Alcohol - Properties and Applications pages 38-43, edited by C. A. Finch, published by J Wiley &amp; Sons in 1973 and EP-A1-0518689.) Suitable electrolytes may, for example, comprise a cation or mixtures of cations selected from the list comprising: ammonium, copper, iron, magnesium, potassium and sodium; and an anion or mixture of anions selected from the list comprising, sulphate, nitrate, fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide, acetate, tartrate, ammonium tartrate, benzenesulphonate, benzoate, bicarbonate, carbonate, bisulphate, bisulphite, sulphate, sulphite, borate, borotartrate, bromate, butyrate, chlorate, camphorate, chlorite, cinnamate, citrate, disilicate, dithionate, ethylsulphate, ferricyanide, ferrocyanide, fluorosilicate, formate, glycerophosphate, hydrogenphosphate, hydroxostannate, hypochlorite, hyponitrite, hypophosphite, iodate, isobutyrate, lactate, laurate, metaborate, metasilicate, methionate, methylsulphate, nitrite, oleate, orthophosphate, orthophosphite, orthosilicate, oxalate, perborate, perchlorate, phosphate, polyfluoride, polychloride, polyiodide, polybromide, polysulphide, polysulphate, polysulphite, salicylate, silicate, sorbate, stannate, stearate, succinate or valerate. Preferred electrolytes are ammonium sulphate, sodium sulphate, potassium sulphate, copper sulphate, ammonium nitrate, sodium nitrate, magnesium sulphate, potassium citrate, potassium nitrate, sodium chloride or potassium chloride.<br>
Thus in another aspect the present invention provides an agrochemical composition packaged in a water-soluble or water-dispersible sachet, the agrochemical composition comprising a water-soluble, agrochemically active ingredient, an electrolyte, water and an agent to minimise water loss through the walls of the sachet.<br>
The agrochemical composition may be in the form of a liquid (which may be thickened using known thickeners) or a gel (gelation may be achieved by using known methods, such as methods described in WO92/01377, EP-A1-0518689 or WO96/03038).<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides an agrochemical composition packaged in a water-soluble or water-dispersible sachet, wherein the agent to minimise water loss through the walls of the sachet is a salt (especially an alkali metal salt) or ester (especially an alkyl ester) of an alkyl, alkenyl, phenyl or phenylalkyl acid (especially a carboxylic or sulphonic acid); an alcohol or an ether of an alcohol.<br>
In a further aspect the present invention provides an agrochemical composition packaged in a water-soluble or water-dispersible sachet, wherein the agent to minimise water loss through the walls of the sachet is a salt (especially a sodium salt) or ester (especially Ci-2o alkyl ester) of an alkyl, alkenyl or phenyl (wherein the phenyl group is optionally substituted with alkyl) acid (especially a carboxylic (such as oleic or adipic) or sulphonic (such as dodecylbenzene sulphonic) acid).<br>
In a still further aspect the present invention provides an agrochemical composition packaged in a water-soluble or water-dispersible sachet, wherein the agent to minimise water loss through the walls of the sachet is a CMJ alkyl ester of an alkyl or alkenyl carboxylic acid (for example methyl oleate, ethyl oleate or di-2-ethylhexyl adipate), or a Ci-6 alkyl ester of an oil extracted from naturally occurring plants or seeds (such as methyl canolate (derived from canola oil) or methyl sunflowerate (derived from sunflower oil)).<br>
Depending on the nature of the water-soluble, agrochemically active ingredient, one or more adjuvants or co-formulants (such as a wetter or anti-freezing agent) may also be comprised in the composition. Suitable adjuvants include neutral or anionic surfactants [such as a soap, a salt of an aliphatic monoester of sulphuric acid (for example, sodium lauryl sulphate), a salt of a sulphonated aromatic compound (for example, sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate) or an alkyl glucoside] or polysaccharides. Suitable wetters include an alkyl glucoside (such as AL2042), a salt of a sulphonated aromatic compound (for example, sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate), an alcohol ethoxylate or a diglucamide. Suitable thickeners include grades of xanthan gum (such as KELTROL速 BT and KELZAN速).<br>
In a further aspect the agrochemical composition also comprises a chelating or sequestering agent for calcium ions. A suitable chelating or sequestering agent is ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).<br>
Over and above the components already mentioned, the agrochemical composition may also comprise an adhesive, an antifoaming agent, a buffer, a deodorant, a dye, an emetic, a preservative, an odourant, a perfume, a safener, a further solvent, a stabiliser, a synergist, a thickener or a wetting agent.<br>
The water-soluble or water-dispersible sachet can be made from a variety of materials and preferred materials are polyethylene oxide, methyl cellulose or, especially, polyvinylalcohol (PVA). The PVA is generally partially or fully alcoholysed or hydrolysed, for example 40-100%, especially 80-100%, alcoholysed or hydrolysed polyvinyl acetate film. The PVA film may be a laminate of two or more thicknesses of film, a surface modified film (for example a film having a waxy layer) or a co-extruded film (such as is described in WO 94/29188). Preferred PVA films include M7030 (a monolayer film), L7030 (a laminate film), M7031 (a monolayer film), L7031 (a laminate film) and M9500 (also referred to as PXP2841, a monolayer film) all available from Chris Craft Industrial Products Inc. of South Holland, Illinois, USA.<br>
The water-soluble or water-dispersible sachet can be formed and filled using standard techniques (such as thermoforming or vertical form-fill-sealing).<br>
In use the packaged agrochemical composition is mixed with water (for example in an agrochemical sprayer) to give a sprayable solution of the water-soluble agrochemically active ingredient.<br>
The packaged agrochemical composition of the present invention can be part of a bag-in-bag arrangement (for example as described in WO 92/17381 or WO 92/17383), part of an arrangement where two water-soluble sachets are joined at a common seal, part of an arrangement as described in Research Disclosure 38534 (published May 1996) or part of a bag-in-bag arrangement where the packaged agrochemical composition of the present invention is enclosed within a second water-soluble sachet holding only the packaged agrochemical composition of the present invention (the second sachet presenting a further barrier to contain the agrochemical composition).<br>
Example 1 is an example of a composition that does not comprise an agent to minimise water loss through the walls of the sachet. Examples 2-8 illustrate the invention.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to an agrochemical composition packaged in a water-soluble or water-dispersible sachet, the agrochemical composition comprising:<br>
(A)	a water-soluble, active ingredient selected from a herbicide, a diquat salt, glyphosate<br>
or a salt or ester thereof, an insecticide, and a fungicide, wherein the water souble active<br>
ingredient is    preferably    paraquat    diehloride,diqaafr-dibromide,   glyphosate<br>
isopropylammonium or glyphosate trimesium (sul fosate),<br>
(B)	water; and<br>
(C)	an agent adapted to minimize water loss through the walls of the sachet selected<br>
from an alkyl, alkenyl, aryl or arylalkyl acid or a salt or ester thereof; an ester of a<br>
naturally occurring oil; a mineral or synthetic oil; an alcohol, an ether of an alcohol or a<br>
glyceride.<br>

EXAMPLE 9<br>
A quantity (around 50g) of each of the compositions from Examples 1-8 was packed into a water-soluble sachet made from M7030 grade polyvinyl alcohol film (76 micron thickness, supplied by Chris Craft). Each packed water-soluble sachet was uniquely  abeled and accurately weighed on an analytical balance. Each packed, weighed sachet was placed in an individual polythene/aluminium/paper secondary pack which was sealed. Two sealed packs of each composition were placed in a constant temperature oven at 40属C and stored for 4 weeks.<br>
Following storage each pack was allowed to reach ambient laboratory conditions. The secondary pack was carefully opened and any signs of permeation of the water-soluble sachet noted. The external surface of the sachet was wiped, the water-soluble sachet was re-weighed, and the % weight loss calculated. The findings are presented in TABLE II.<br>
