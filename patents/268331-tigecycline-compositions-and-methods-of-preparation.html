TIGECYCLINE COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS OF PREPARATION<br>
This application claims priority from copending provisional application<br>
Serial Number 60/661,030 filed March 14, 2005 the entire disclosure of which is<br>
hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The present invention relates to improved tigecycline compositions and<br>
methods for making such compositions. The inventive compositions have<br>
improved stability in both solid and solution states. The inventive compositions<br>
comprise tigecycline, a suitable carbohydrate, and an acid or buffer. The<br>
combination of the suitable carbohydrate and the acid or buffer reduces<br>
tigecycline degradation as explained below. The present invention provides<br>
advantages over the prior art by providing for stable tigecycline compositions and<br>
methods for making such compositions that achieve stability against both<br>
oxidative degradation and eplmerization. These compositions are, therefore,<br>
more stable when dissolved, lyophilized, reconstituted, and/or diluted than<br>
compositions of tigecycline not made according to the invention.<br>
Tigecycline is a known antibiotic in the tetracycline family and a chemical<br>
analog of minocycline. It may be used as a treatment against drug-resistant<br>
bacteria, and it has been shown to work where other antibiotics have failed. For<br>
example, it is active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-<br>
resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (D.J.<br>

Tigecyciine has historically been administered intravenously because it<br>
exhibits generally poor bioavailability when given orally. Intravenous solutions<br>
have largely been prepared immediately prior to use, e.g., administration to a<br>
patient, from lyophilized powders because tigecyciine degrades in solution<br>
principally via oxidation. It would be preferable as well as desirable to have an<br>
intravenous formulation of tigecyciine that did not require immediate use and<br>
could remain stable in solution for up to 24 hours.<br>
Tigecyciine is currently manufactured as a lyophilized powder. Due to the<br>
propensity for tigecyciine to degrade, these powders are prepared under low-<br>
oxygen and low-temperature conditions in order to minimize degradation. Such<br>
processing is expensive because it requires special equipment and handling.<br>
The typical process for preparing these powder compositions involves<br>
dissolving tigecyciine in water (compounding) and lyophilizing (freeze-drying) the<br>
solution to dryness to form solid cakes of amorphous tigecyciine. These cakes<br>
are then loaded under nitrogen into stoppered glass vials and shipped to end<br>
users such as hospital pharmacies. Prior to being administered to patients, the<br>
cakes are reconstituted, often in 0.9% saline, to a concentration of, for example,<br>
about 10 mg/mL. At this concentration, tigecyciine degrades rapidly in solution<br>
and therefore, must be used without delay. Thus, these reconstituted solutions<br>
are immediately diluted (also known as admixing) to about 1 mg/mL with saline or<br>
other pharmaceutically acceptable diluents into intravenous bags for patient<br>
delivery.<br>
In this diluted state, tigecyciine is ready for intravenous delivery to a<br>
patient. At a concentration of 1 mg/mL, however, tigecyciine should be used<br>
within 6 hours of dilution. Because intravenous infusions may take several hours,<br>
hospital personnel must act quickly so that from the time admixture begins to the<br>
time the tigecyciine dose has been administered to a patient, not more then 6<br>
hours have elapsed. It would be more preferred to provide hospital staff with the<br>
flexibility and advantages that come with longer admixture and reconstitution<br>
times so that, for instance, a hospital pharmacist could prepare a solution the day<br>
before it is needed to be administered to a patient.<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/099258	PCT/US2006/008827<br>
Tigecycline has such a short admixture time and the reconstitution time is<br>
essentially zero because in solution, tigecycline oxidation is relatively rapid.<br>
Under current manufacturing, storage, and administration conditions, the most<br>
prevalent form of degradation is via oxidation. The reason oxidation is the most<br>
prevalent form of degradation in previous formulations relates to the chemical<br>
structure of tigecycline. It possesses a phenol moiety, and it is well known in the<br>
art of organic chemistry that phenols are particularly prone to oxidation. When<br>
tigecycline is dissolved in water prior to lyophilization, the pH is slightly basic<br>
(about 7.8). This is higher than the pKa of the phenolic group on tigecycline.<br>
Thus, in both water and saline solutions, the phenolic group becomes<br>
deprotonated and more susceptible to reaction with oxygen which is why<br>
tigecycline compounding and lyophilization occur under a nitrogen blanket.<br>
Accordingly, care to avoid unnecessary exposure to oxygen must be taken by<br>
hospital staff during reconstitution and dilution.<br>
If the pH of the tigecycline solution were less than the pKa of the phenolic<br>
group on tigecycline, then oxidation would occur, but to a lesser extent. Indeed, it<br>
has been observed that tigecycline oxidative degradation does decrease when the<br>
pH is lowered. At low pH, however, another degradative process occurs,<br>
epimerization. At lower pHs, epimerization emerges as the most predominant<br>
degradation pathway.<br>
Tigecycline differs structurally from its epimer in only one respect.<br><br><br><br>
WO 2006/099258	PCT/US2006/008827<br>
In tigecycline, the N-dimethyl group at the 4 carbon is cis to the adjacent hydrogen<br>
as shown above in formula I, whereas in the epimer, formula II, they are trans to<br>
one another in the manner indicated. Although the tigecycline epimer. is believed<br>
to be non-toxic, it lacks the anti-bacterial efficacy of tigecycline and is, therefore,<br>
an undesirable degradation product.<br>
In the lyophilized state, tigecycline follows the same degradation pathways<br>
as in solution, but the rate of degradation is slower. Thus, when tigecycline is<br>
lyophilized in water such that the pH is about 7.8, the resulting iyophilized cake<br>
exhibits oxidative degradation, albeit at a slower rate than in solution. Similarly,<br>
when tigecycline is lyophilized in an acidic solution, the primary degradation<br>
pathway is epimerization and it also occurs at a slower rate than in solution.<br>
Epimerization is a known degradation pathway in tetracyclines generally,<br>
although the rate of degradation may vary depending upon the tetracyciine.<br>
Comparatively, the epimerization rate of tigecycline is particularly fast. The<br>
tetracyciine literature reports several methods scientists have used to try and<br>
minimize epimer formation in tetracyclines. In some methods, the formation of<br>
calcium, magnesium, zinc or aluminum metal salts with tetracyclines limit epimer<br>
formation when done at basic pHs in non-aqueous solutions. (Gordon, P.N,<br>
Stephens Jr, C.R., Noseworthy, M. M., Teare, F.W., U.K. Patent No. 901,107). In<br>
other methods, (Tobkes, U.S. Patent No. 4,038,315) the formation of a metal<br>
complex is performed at acidic pH and a stable solid form of the drug is<br>
subsequently prepared.<br>
Other methods for reducing epimer formation include maintaining pHs of<br>
greater than about 6.0 during processing; avoiding contact with conjugates of<br>
weak acids such as formates, acetates, phosphates, or boronates; and avoiding<br>
contact with moisture including water-based solutions. With regard to moisture<br>
protection, Noseworthy and Spiegel (U.S. Patent No. 3,026,248) and Nash and<br>
Haeger, (U.S. Patent No. 3,219,529) have proposed formulating tetracyciine<br>
analogs in non-aqueous vehicles to improve drug stability. However, most of the<br>
vehicles included in these inventions are more appropriate for topical than<br>
parenteral use. Tetracyciine epimerization is also known to be temperature<br>
dependent so production and storage of tetracyclines at low temperatures can<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/099258	PCT/US2006/008827<br>
also reduce the rate of epimer formation (Yuen, P.H., Sokoloski, T.D., J. Pharm.<br>
Sci. 66: 1648-1650,1977; Pawelczyk, E., Matlak, B, Pol. J. Pharmacol. Pharm. 34:<br>
409-421,1982). Several of these methods have been attempted with tigecycline<br>
but none have succeeded in reducing both epimer formation and oxidative<br>
degradation while not introducing additional degradants. Metal complexation, for<br>
example, was found to have little effect on either epimer formation or degradation<br>
generally at basic pH.<br>
Although the use of phosphate, acetate, and citrate buffers improve<br>
solution state stability, they seem to accelerate degradation of tigecycline in the<br>
lyophilized state. Even without a buffer, however, epimerization is a more serious<br>
problem with tigecycline than with other tetracyclines such as minocycline.<br>
Others of these methods similarly failed to reduce both epimerization and<br>
oxidative degradation. Although it was found that maintaining a pH of greater than<br>
about 6.0 helps reduce epimer formation, as noted above, such conditions lead to<br>
greater oxygen sensitivity. With respect to non-aqueous vehicles, although water<br>
is known to accelerate tigecycline degradation, it would be impractical to prepare<br>
an intravenous medication using such vehicles.<br>
Whereas it has been determined that processing at temperatures lower<br>
than room temperature, such as below about 10°C, reduces the tigecycline<br>
degradation rate, such processing is expensive and it would be advantageous to<br>
use a composition that did not require expensive refrigeration during processing.<br>
Chinese patent application CN 1390550A discloses that minocyciine could<br>
be combined with an acid to increase the stability toward the oxidative<br>
degradation. It further discloses the use of a caking agent, such as mannitol.<br>
This reference says nothing about tigecycline nor does it suggest that<br>
carbohydrates could be used to reduce either oxidation or epimerization for<br>
minocycline in reduced pH environments. Indeed, minocycline can be formulated<br>
as a hydrochloride salt in intravenous products without significant epimerization.<br>
In tigecycline hydrochloride salts, however, significant epimerization occurs.<br>
Thus, minocycline and tigecycline possess different epimerization properties.<br>
In another experiment, minocycline was lyophilized at a pH of about 5.0<br>
and the lyophilized cake was stored for 20 days at 40°C and 75% relative<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2006/099258	PCT/US2006/008827<br>
humidity. At the end of the 20 days, the cake was analyzed by HPLC. The<br>
epimer of minocycline was measured to be present at a level of 2.65% by mass.<br>
By comparison, when tigecycline was lyophilized at a pH of about 5.0 and the<br>
sample stored under the same conditions, but for only 4 days followed by HPLC<br>
analysis, the tigecycline epimer was measured to be at a leve! of 5.40%, over<br>
twice as much even though tigecycline was only stressed for 1/5th as long'as<br>
minocycline. Thus, tigecycline epimerizes much more readily than minocycline,<br>
and epimerization is a much more significant problem with tigecycline than it is for<br>
minocycline.<br>
The present invention addresses the various problems and disadvantages<br>
of the prior art by providing for stable compositions of tigecycline in solid and<br>
solution form. By lyophilizing an aqueous solution containing tigecycline and a<br>
suitable carbohydrate at an acidic pH, we have prepared tigecycline compositions •<br>
that are more stable against both oxidative degradation and epimerization than<br>
existing compositions. Because the pH is acidic, oxidative degradation has been<br>
minimized. Furthermore, it has been determined that suitable carbohydrates act<br>
to stabilize-tigecycline-againstepimerformation-at acidic pHs<br>
Compositions of the invention are more stable in the lyophilized state than<br>
the existing compositions and do not require low-temperature or low-oxygen ■<br>
processing conditions. Such compositions are also expected to possess<br>
reconstitution and admixture stability times greater than that of the existing<br>
compositions. For example, one embodiment of the invention is stable for 6 hours<br>
after reconstitution and stable for an additional 18 hours after admixture. These<br>
extended stability times make tigecycline much easier to use in a hospital<br>
environment by providing needed flexibility to hospital staff when treating patients.<br>
Solid-state compositions of the invention comprise tigecycline, a suitable<br>
carbohydrate, and an acid or buffer.<br>
Suitable carbohydrates are those carbohydrates capable of reducing<br>
epimer formation in at least one solid form prepared in at least one pH<br>
environment when compared to a tigecycline solid form prepared at the same pH<br>
environment lacking suitable carbohydrates. In one embodiment, the pH<br>
environment ranges from about 3.0 to about 7.0, such as pHs ranging from about<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/099258	PCT/US2006/008827<br>
4.0 to about 5.0, or from about 4.2 to about 4.8. In one embodiment, the at least<br>
one solid form is chosen from powders and lyophilized cakes of tigecycline.<br>
Examples of suitable carbohydrates include the anhydrous, hydrated, and<br>
solvated forms of compounds such as lactose, mannose, sucrose, and glucose.<br>
Suitable carbohydrates include mono and disaccharides e.g. an aldose •<br>
monosaccharide or a disaccharide, preferably a disaccharide such as lactose and<br>
sucrose. Lactose is most preferred. Accordingly, suitable carbohydrates may<br>
include different solid forms. For example, by iactose we include the different<br>
solid forms of lactose such as anhydrous lactose, lactose monohydrate or any<br>
other hydrated or solvated form of lactose. Lactose and sucrose are<br>
disaccharides. It is therefore expected that disaccharides as a class will work<br>
according to the invention.<br>
The compositions of the invention include solutions, such as those<br>
prepared prior to lyophilization, containing tigecycline, a suitable carbohydrate,<br>
and an acid or buffer. In some embodiments of the invention, the solutions may<br>
be stored for several hours prior to lyophilization in order to provide greater<br>
-manufacturing flexibility. Compositions-ofthe invention further include lyophilized<br>
powders or cakes containing tigecycline, a suitable carbohydrate, and an acid or<br>
buffer.<br>
In some embodiments of the invention, the suitable carbohydrate used is<br>
lactose monohydrate and the molar ratio of tigecycline to lactose monohydrate in<br>
the lyophilized powder or cake is between about 1:0.2 to about 1:5. Some<br>
embodiments have tigecycline to lactose monohydrate molar ratios of between<br>
about 1:1.6 to about 1:3.3.<br>
Compositions of the invention also include solutions made from the<br>
lyophilized powder or cake by, for example, reconstitution with saline or other<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable diluents. Compositions of the invention further<br>
include solutions resulting from diluting those reconstituted solutions with<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable diluents for use in intravenous bags.<br>
Any carbohydrate capable of reducing epimer formation in the invention is<br>
a suitable carbohydrate and this invention is not limited to compositions employing<br>
those carbohydrates specifically identified.<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/099258	PCT/US2006/008827<br>
It is expected that derivatives of sugars, for example, may work according<br>
to the invention to reduce epimer formation. Thus, to the extent that derivatives of<br>
sugars, such as sugar alcohols, glucoseamines, and alkyl esters alone or in<br>
combination reduce epimer formation according to the invention, they are suitable<br>
carbohydrates. Likewise, other suitable carbohydrates may include higher<br>
saccharides such as polysaccharides; complex carbohydrates such as hetastarch,<br>
dextran; and celluloses such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl<br>
cellulose. It is further expected that combinations of carbohydrates, including<br>
monosaccharides and trisaccharides, will be suitable carbohydrates and work to<br>
reduce epimer formation according to the invention.<br>
Acids and buffers of the invention include any pharmaceuticaliy acceptable<br>
acid or buffer capable of adjusting the pH of a tigecycline/suitable carbohydrate<br>
solution to between about 3.0 to about 7.0, about 4.0 to about 5.0, or about 4.2 to .<br>
about 4.8. Examples of such acids include, but are not limited to, hydrochloric •<br>
acid, including 1.0 N HCl, gentisic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, acetic acid, and<br>
phosphoric acid. Examples of suitable buffers include succinates.<br>
	Compounds of the invention may be prepared via a number of acceptable<br>
methods. The methods described below are exemplary and not meant to limit the <br>
invention.<br>
In one method of the invention, tigecycline is dissolved in water to form a<br>
solution. The pH of the solution is subsequently lowered by addition of an acid or<br>
buffer. A suitable carbohydrate is then dissolved in the solution and the solution is<br>
lyophilized to dryness to form a lyophilized powder or cake.<br>
Tigecycline may be blended with a suitable carbohydrate and dissolved in<br>
water. After the pH of the solution is adjusted so that it is acidic, the solution may<br>
then be lyophilized to dryness to form a lyophilized powder or cake.<br>
Lyophilization of solutions of the invention may be accomplished by any<br>
pharmaceuticaliy acceptable means. Once lyophilized, compositions of the<br>
invention may be stored under an inert gas, such as nitrogen, to further slow the<br>
degradation process, but, unlike the current tigecycline composition, such low<br>
oxygen environments are not necessary for the invention.<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2006/099258	PCT/US2006/008827<br>
When tigecycline is combined with a suitable carbohydrate, any solid-state<br>
form of tigecycline that is sufficiently soluble in water may be used. Such solid-<br>
state forms include crystalline tigecycline polymorphs, amorphous forms, and<br>
salts.<br>
Additionally, when preparing tigecycline solutions of the invention for<br>
lyophilization, one adds sufficient acid or buffer to the aqueous solution containing<br>
tigecycline to obtain a pH from about 3.0 and about 7.0 including from about 4.0 to<br>
about 5.0 and from about 4.2 to about 4.8.<br>
The compositions of the invention may be prepared for single-dosage use.<br>
In this embodiment, the solutions of the invention are lyophilized in individual vials,<br>
such as 20 ml vials. Upon lyophilization, the vials are stoppered with any<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable stopper. The stoppered viais are then shipped for<br>
use.<br>
When needed, the vials can be reconstituted by adding sufficient diluent to<br>
achieve the desired concentration of tigecycline. The concentration of<br>
reconstituted solutions may be easily determined by those of ordinary skilled in<br>
the art Any pharmaceutically acceptable diluent may be used. Examples of such<br>
diluents include water, saline, such as 0.9% saline, Lactated Ringer's Injection<br>
solution and dextrose solutions including 5% dextrose (D5W).<br>
Reconstituted solutions of the invention may then be stored in a<br>
reconstituted state, unlike current compositions, prior to admixture. Admixture can<br>
occur, for example, in an intravenous bag. To prepare an admixture, sufficient .<br>
reconstituted solution is mixed in an intravenous bag containing a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable diluent such as saline solution or dextrose solution<br>
such as D5W. The concentration of admixtures may be easily determined by<br>
those of ordinary skill in the art. Admixture times for compositions of the invention<br>
can be much longer than those of the existing composition. Once admixed, the<br>
tigecycline solution is ready for patient administration. The admixture may be<br>
administered alone or together with another pharmaceutical agent or composition.<br>
The following six examples illustrate various embodiments of the invention<br>
and are not intended to limit the invention in any way. Each example details<br>
several experiments where tigecyciine was dissolved with a carbohydrate in<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2006/099258	PCT/US2006/008827<br>
aqueous acidic solution, lyophilized, and analyzed for degradation products by<br>
HPLC. The HPLC conditions for each example were essentially the same. The<br>
tables accompanying the examples reflect the results of the HPLC data which<br>
show the oxidative degradation products identified in the tables as relative<br>
retention times (RRT) 0.50/MW 601 and RRT 0.55/MW 583, the epimer (RRT<br>
0.74/MW 585), and the total amount of tigecycline present under a variety of<br>
conditions (identified as "Tigecycline" in the tables"), in many instances, after the<br>
solutions were lyophilized, they were placed under accelerated stability conditions<br>
of 40°C and 75% relative humidity. These conditions are industry standards used<br>
for simulating the effect of long-term storage under normal shelf conditions. •<br>
In example 1, solutions of tigecycline, lactose, and 1.0 N HCl were<br>
lyophilized and the resulting cakes were placed in stability chambers at 40°C and<br>
75% relative humidity for 25 days. At the end of the 25 days, the cakes were<br>
analyzed by HPLC to identify degradation products.<br>
A similar experiment is detailed in Example 2a. There, the lyophilized<br>
cakes were analyzed by HPLC after being stored for 39 days at 40°C and 75%<br>
-relative-humidity Sample cakes from two of the experiments were-reconstituted<br>
in D5W (5% dextrose) and samples from the remaining cakes were reconstituted<br>
in saline immediately prior to HPLC analysis.<br>
In experiment 2b, after the lyophilized cakes were stressed as per the<br>
conditions in example 2a, several of the cakes were reconstituted in 0.9% saline<br>
and kept in solution for 6 hours. Others were reconstituted in dextrose. At the<br>
end of the 6 hour period, some of these solution samples, as identified in table 2b,<br>
were tested by HPLC.<br>
Example 2c illustrates a stability test on admixed solutions. In these<br>
solutions, the reconstituted solutions of example 2b were held for 6 hours at about<br>
10 mg/mL and then diluted to about 1 mg/mL, the typical intravenous<br>
concentration for tigecycline, and held for 18 hours prior to analysis by HPLC<br>
(table 2c).<br>
In example 3, gentisic acid, rather than hydrochloric acid, was used to<br>
reduce the pH of the pre-lyophilized solutions of tigecycline. Once lyophilized, the<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2006/099258	PCT/US2006/008827<br>
cakes were stressed at 45°C and 75% relative humidity for 48 days and then<br>
analyzed by HPLC.<br>
The samples of example 4 show the effects of changing from lactose to<br>
other carbohydrates on epimer formation and tigecycline recovery when making<br>
the pre-lyophilized tigecycline solutions. In each of examples 4a, 4b, and 4c, the<br>
indicated solutions were prepared and lyophilized. Each cake was stressed<br>
according to the parameters provided in examples 4a-4c, taken into solution, and<br>
analyzed by HPLC.<br>
Hold time, the time in between compounding and lyophilization, and order<br>
of tigecycline and lactose addition were studied as factors in epimer formation and<br>
tigecycline recovery in example 5. Once the cakes were lyophilized, they were<br>
stressed at 40°C and 75% relative humidity for 48 days prior to HPLC analysis.<br>
Summaries of the HPLC data appear in table 5.<br>
The ratio of lactose to tigecycline was varied in the experiments in example<br>
6. When preparing the solutions to be lyophilized, varying ratios of lactose to<br>
tigecycline were employed. The mass ratios are reported in the first column of<br>
Table 6 . The so1utions,which each had a pH of about 5.0, were subsequently<br>
lyophilized to dryness and the resulting cakes were stressed at 40°C and 75%<br>
relative humidity for 20 days and analyzed by HPLC.<br>
Example 1<br>
Tigecycline (1880 mg) was dissolved in 75ml of Milli-Q water to form, a bulk<br>
solution. An aliquot from this bulk solution containing approximately 100 mg of<br>
tigecycline was dissolved into a 20 ml vial containing 200 mg of lactose<br>
monohydrate. Another aliquot of the bulk solution containing approximately 100<br>
mg of tigecycline was placed into an empty 20 ml sample vial. No pH adjustment<br>
was made to either of these two solutions. The solutions were subsequently<br>
lyophilized to dryness.<br>
The pH of the remaining bulk solution was lowered to about 6.0 with the<br>
addition of 1.0N HCl. Once a pH of about 6.0 was obtained, an aliquot from the<br>
bulk solution containing about 100 mg of tigecycline was dissolved into a 20 ml<br>
sample vial containing about 200 mg of lactose monohydrate and the resulting<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/099258	PCT/US2006/008827<br>
solution was lyophilized to dryness. The remaining bulk solution was treated with .<br>
1 .0N HCl until a pH of about 5.5 was obtained at which point 100 mg of .tigecycline<br>
from the bulk solution was transferred into a 20 ml vial containing 200 mg of<br>
lactose monohydrate. After dissolution, the solution was lyophilized to dryness.<br>
Similarly, 20 ml sample vials containing solutions of about 100 mg of tigecycline<br>
and about 200 mg of lactose were prepared at pHs of about 5.0 and about 4.5.<br>
Another solution sample was prepared at about pH 4.5 without any lactose. In<br>
each case, the solutions were subsequently lyophilized to dryness. All<br>
lyophilizations were done on solutions frozen at -70°C by dry ice with acetone.<br>
The lyophilized samples were placed in a 40°C/75%RH chamber for 25<br>
days. Afterwards, the samples were analyzed by HPLC and a summary of the<br>
results appears below in table 1, which reflects the major degradation products for<br>
each cake that was tested. The sum total of the 6 major degradation products<br>
listed in the tables does not equal 100% because not all degradation products are<br>
listed in the table. Of the 7 cakes tested in example 1, 5 were compositions of the<br>
invention and the first two (tigecycline alone without pH adjustment and tigecycline<br>
plus lactose without pH adjustment) where controlos<br>
The advantages of the compositions of the invention are apparent from this<br>
example. For instance, in the composition prepared without lactose at a pH of<br>
about 4.5, only 74.10% tigecycline was detected whereas the epimer was present<br>
in an amount of 23.51%. By comparison, the pH 4.5 sample with lactose'<br>
contained only 2.53% epimer and had a tigecycline content of 97.17%.<br>

Example 2<br>
2a. Tigecycline (1700mg) was dissolved in 85ml of Milli-Q water to form a bulk<br>
solution. Solutions containing about 100 mg of tigecycline and about 200 mg of<br>
lactose monohydrate were prepared at pHs of about 5.2, 5.0, 4.8, and 3.0 in the<br>
same manner that tigecycline/lactose/HCl solutions were prepared in example 1.<br>
A solution of tigecycline and lactose at pH of about 4.5 was prepared by adding<br>
1.0 N NaOH to the bulk solution at pH 3.0 followed by dissolving an aliquot of bulk<br>
solution containing about 100 mg of tigecycline into a 20 ml vial containing about<br>
200 mg of lactose monohydrate. All samples were lyophilized (frozen at -50°C by<br>
freeze dryers from AdVantage/Virtis) to dryness. The lyophiiized samples were<br>
placed in a 40°C/75%RH chamber for 39 days and sub-sampled and analyzed by<br>
HPLC. The data are shown in table 2a.<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2006/099258	PCT/US2006/008827<br>
2b.	At the end of 39 days, the lyophilized cakes of Example 2a were<br>
reconstituted with 0.9% NaCl to a concentration of 10 mg/ml of tigecycline and<br>
kept at room temperature for 6 hours. Separate aliquots of the solutions at pH of<br>
about 5.0 and about 4.5 were reconstituted with 5% Dextrose, instead of saline, to<br>
a concentration of about 10mg/ml and kept at room temperature for 6 hours;<br>
Each of the solutions was then analyzed by HPLC, and the results are shown in<br>
Table 2b.<br>
The data show that the compositions of the invention protect against<br>
epimer formation in reconstituted solutions for 6 hours. Indeed, the maximum<br>
epimer content of any one of these examples was only 2.45%, whereas the<br>
minimum tigecycline content was 97.1 %. In one embodiment, where the pH was<br>
about 4.5 and the diluent was saline, at the end of the 6 hour reconstitution period,<br>
only 1.60% of epimer was present. In that embodiment, the amount of tigecycline<br>
was measured to be 98.15%, which, in some applications, may be of sufficient<br>
purity for hospital use.<br>
2c.	Admixture solutions of tigecycline (at 1 mg/ml) were made by diluting the<br>
reconstituted solution (from example 2b) with 0.9% NaCl or 5% Dextrose<br>
depending upon which diluent was used for reconstitution. The solutions were<br>
then kept at room temperature for 18 hours and analyzed by HPLC. The results<br>
are summarized in Table 2c.<br>
The sample at about pH 4.5 with lactose and without dextrose had its<br>
epimer concentration increase from 1.60% to only 1.80% on. going from<br>
reconstitution to admixture whereas the overall tigecycline content decreased only<br>
slightly for that sample from 98.15% to 97.97%. These results on the about pH<br>
4.5 sample illustrate that that sample is sufficiently stable after the lyophilized<br>
cake is stored under accelerated stability conditions for 39 days followed by 6<br>
hours of reconstitution and 18 hours of admixture.<br>

Tigecyciine (700mg) was dissolved in 28ml of Milli-Q water to form a bulk<br>
solution. An aliquot of the bulk solution containing about 100 mg of tigecycline<br>
was loaded into a 20 ml vial as control sample. Solution samples of tigecycline,<br>
lactose, and an acid were prepared at pHs of about 5.8, 5.1, and 4.5 according to<br>
the methods of example 1 except that gentisic acid was used to lower the pH of<br>
the bulk solution rather than 1.0 N HCl. An additional two samples of tigecycline<br>
solutions without lactose were prepared, one at a pH of about 5.1 and another at a<br>
pH of about 4.5. All of the solutions were frozen at -70°C (by dry ice with<br>

4a. Tigecycline (1600mg) was dissolved in 64ml-of Milli-Q water to form a bulk<br>
solution and two samples from the solution, each containing about 100 mg of<br>
tigecycline, were loaded into two separate sample 20 ml sample vials containing<br>
160 mg of lactose monohydrate and 160 mg mannitol respectively. A third<br>
sample containing about 100 mg of tigecycline from the bulk solution was loaded<br>
into a blank 20 ml vial. The pH of the remainder of the bulk solution was<br>
sequentially adjusted with 1.0N HCI to about 7.0, 6.5, and 6.0 as per the<br>
procedure outlined in example 1. Sample solutions each containing about 100<br>
mg tigecycline were loaded into 20 ml vials containing 160 mg of lactose<br>
monohydrate, 160 mg of mannitol, or neither at each pH value. The resulting<br>
solutions were lyophilized (frozen at-70°C by dry ice with acetone) to dryness.<br>
The lyophilized samples were placed in a 40°C oven for 70 hours and then<br>
analyzed by HPLC. The data are summarized in table 4a.<br>
4b. Tigecycline (1800mg) was dissolved in 72ml of Milli-Q water to form a bulk<br>
solution. Aliquots from the bulk solution containing about 100 mg of tigecycline<br>
were loaded into three separate 20 ml vials containing about 200 mg of lactose<br>
monohydrate, fructose, and sucrose respectively. The pH of the bulk solution was<br>
sequentially adjusted with 1.0N HC! to about 6.0 and 5.4 according to the<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2006/099258	PCT/US2006/008827<br>
procedure outlined in example 1. At each pH value, aliquots of solution containing<br>
about 100 mg of tigecycline were taken into 20 ml vials containing 200mg of one<br>
of the following carbohydrates:<br>
lactose monohydrate, fructose, or sucrose and dissolved. Solutions without<br>
carbohydrates were also prepared at each pH value. The solutions were<br>
lyophilized (frozen at -70°C by dry ice with acetone) to dryness. The lyophilized<br>
samples were placed in a 40°C oven for 89 hours and analyzed by HPLC. The<br>
results are summarized in Table 4b.<br>

solution. The pH of the bulk solution was adjusted with 1.0N.HCI to about 5.0.<br>
Four aliquots of bulk solution, each containing about 100 mg of tigecycline, were<br>
ioaded into 20 m! vials containing about 200 mg of glucose, mannose, ribose, and<br>
xylose respectively and dissolved. A fifth aliquot of bulk solution containing about<br>

solution. The pH of the bulk solution was adjusted to about 5.0 with 1.0N HCl.<br>
Four aliquots of the bulk solution, each containing about 100 mg tigecycline, were<br>
loaded separately into four 20 ml vials containing about 50,100, 200, and-300mg<br>
of lactose monohydrate respectively. Once the lactose completely dissolved, the<br>
samples were lyophilized (frozen at -50°C by freeze dryers from AdVantage/Virtis)<br>
to dryness. The iyophilized samples were piaced in a 40°C 75%RH chamber for 4<br>
days and analyzed by HPLC. The results are summarized in Table 6a and give<br>
examples of compositions of the invention.<br>
6b. Tigecycline (400mg) was dissolved in 20ml of Milli-Q water to form a bulk<br>
solution. The pH of the bulk solution was adjusted to about 5.0 with 1.0N HCl.<br>
Three aliquots of the bulk solution, each containing about 100 mg tigecycline, were<br>
loaded separately into three 20 ml vials containing 15, 31, and 62 mg lactose<br>
monohydrate respectively. Upon dissolution, the samples were lyophilized (frozen<br>
at -50°C by freeze dryers from AdVantage/Virtis) to dryness. The lyophilized<br>
samples were placed in a 40°C/75%RH chamber for 20 days and analyzed by<br>
HPLC. The results are summarized in Table 6b and show compositions of the<br>
invention.<br>
