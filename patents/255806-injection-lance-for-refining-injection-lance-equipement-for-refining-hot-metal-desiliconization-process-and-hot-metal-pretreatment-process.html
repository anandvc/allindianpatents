DESCRIPTION<br>
INJECTION LANCE FOR REFINING, INJECTION LANCE EQUIPMENT FOR<br>
REFINING, HOT-METAL DESILICONIZATION PROCESS, AND HOT-METAL<br>
PRETREATMENT PROCESS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an injection lance and<br>
lance equipment for injecting an oxygen gas into molten<br>
metal to refine the molten metal.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for<br>
pretreating hot metal contained in a transfer container, in<br>
particular, a hot-metal desiliconization process, using the<br>
injection lance or the lance equipment.<br>
The lance may be used to inject a refining agent<br>
together with an oxygen gas. The pretreatment process does<br>
not exclude temporarily injecting a carrier gas other than<br>
the oxygen gas from the lance.<br>
Background Art<br>
Hot metal produced by reduction of iron ore in a blast<br>
furnace contains impurities, such as silicon, sulfur, and<br>
phosphorus. In recent years, as steel has been upgraded, to<br>
reduce the phosphorus content or streamline the steelmaking<br>
process, a hot-metal dephosphorization process has widely<br><br><br>
been performed in a converter or a transfer container, such<br>
as a ladle or a torpedo car. Furthermore, to perform the<br>
dephosphorization process efficiently, a desiliconization<br>
process for removing silicon in hot metal is also performed<br>
before the dephosphorization process. The desiliconization<br>
process and the dephosphorization process are generally<br>
referred to as a hot-metal pretreatment process.<br>
Phosphorus and silicon in hot metal are removed by<br>
oxidation. Thus, in the dephosphorization process and the<br>
desiliconization process, an oxygen source, such as an<br>
oxygen gas or iron oxide, is supplied to hot metal to remove <br>
phosphorus or silicon in the hot metal by oxidation. A flux,<br>
such as lime (lime powder), is also added to hot metal to<br>
improve the reaction efficiency or control the composition<br>
of the resulting slag. A reaction in which silicon in hot<br>
metal is removed by oxidation is referred to as<br>
desiliconization. A reaction in which phosphorus in hot<br>
metal is removed by oxidation is referred to as<br>
dephosphorization.<br>
Althdugh oxygen can be supplied to hot metal by<br>
charging iron oxide (solid oxygen source) into the hot metal,<br>
the solid oxygen source has a tendency to decrease the<br>
temperature of the hot metal by the fusion and decomposition<br>
of the solid oxygen source. The reduction in temperature of<br>
hot metal may reduce the scrap ratio or result in an<br><br><br>
insufficient heat capacity in decarburization refining in a<br>
converter in the next process. Thus, in one known method,<br>
an oxygen gas is supplied to hot metal to prevent the<br>
reduction in temperature of hot metal.<br>
In the hot-metal dephosphorization process and the hot-<br>
metal desiliconization process, an oxygen gas is supplied to<br>
hot metal generally by two methods. In one method, an<br>
oxygen gas is blown on the surface of a hot metal, for<br>
example, using a top-blowing lance that is not in contact<br>
with the hot metal (hereinafter referred to as "oxygen top<br>
blowing") (see, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 53-78913). In the other method,<br>
an oxygen gas is directly injected into hot metal with an<br>
injection lance immersed in the hot metal or a tuyere<br>
disposed, for example, at the bottom of a reaction vessel<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "injection of oxygen gas") (see,<br>
for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application<br>
Publication No. 61-42763). These two methods have their<br>
advantages. The injection of oxygen gas can efficiently<br>
supply the oxygen gas and improve the agitation force.<br>
However, a heat load on the immersed portion of the<br>
injection lance is large (for example, the immersed portion<br>
wears quickly even compared with a tuyere that is under a<br>
unidirectional heat load) , and the life time of use of the<br>
injection lance is limited. By contrast, in the oxygen top<br><br>
blowing, the top-blowing lance is under a reduced heat load<br>
and can be used for an extended period of time. However,<br>
the oxygen top blowing cannot supply the oxygen gas<br>
efficiently and lacks agitation force.<br>
Thus, the oxygen top blowing or the injection of oxygen<br>
gas is selected in consideration of these advantages and<br>
disadvantages. For example, in a torpedo car, the oxygen<br>
top blowing has a low reaction efficiency because of the<br>
shape of the processing container; therefore, the injection<br>
of oxygen gas must be selected. More specifically, the<br>
shape of a torpedo car is not suitable for agitation and<br>
mixing. Furthermore, the opening area of a torpedo car is<br>
small in relation to the volume of hot metal. The oxygen<br>
top blowing cannot therefore achieve a desired reaction<br>
efficiency.<br>
As described above, since an immersed portion of an<br>
injection lance for use in the injection of oxygen gas wears<br>
quickly, various methods have been proposed to solve this<br>
problem. For example, Japanese Unexamined Utility Model<br>
Registration Application Publication No. 6-6447 discloses a<br>
technique for preventing the erosion of a tip part of an<br>
injection lance, wherein the injection lance is composed of<br>
the tip part, which is to be immersed in molten metal, and a<br>
holder for holding the tip part, and the tip part has an<br>
entirely calorized single-tube structure and is coated with<br><br><br>
a refractory. Furthermore, Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 58-221210 discloses a technique<br>
for preventing the erosion of a tip part of an injection<br>
lance, wherein the injection lance has a double-tube<br>
structure coated with a refractory, a refining agent and an<br>
oxygen gas are blown from the inner tube, and a hydrocarbon-<br>
based gas is blown from the outer tube. In the technique<br>
according to Japanese Unexamined Patent Application<br>
Publication No. 58-221210, the hydrocarbon-based gas<br>
decomposes when heated, and the endothermic decomposition<br>
heat of the hydrocarbon-based gas is used to cool the tip<br>
part of the injection lance.<br>
Furthermore, paying attention to an external force<br>
exerted on a lance, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application<br>
Publication No. 54-23019 discloses a technique for<br>
increasing the life time of an injection lance, wherein a<br>
tip part of the injection lance is provided with a<br>
horizontal portion to reduce the reaction force of blowing,<br>
thus reducing vibrations of an immersed portion or the<br>
stress acting on the immersed portion. Furthermore,<br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 60-<br>
234908 discloses a technique for reducing vibrations caused<br>
by blowing, wherein an injection lance is provided with an<br>
upper fixing apparatus comprising rollers arranged in the<br>
direction surrounding the lance and a pinchable sandwich-<br><br><br>
type lower fixing apparatus.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
However, the existing techniques described above have<br>
the following problems. In a container, such as a torpedo<br>
car, that is not suitable for agitation and mixing and has a<br>
small opening area in relation to the volume of hot metal,<br>
it is desirable to blow a large amount of oxygen into the<br>
hot metal in the desiliconization process and other<br>
processes. However, as in Japanese Unexamined Utility Model<br>
Registration Application Publication No. 6-6447, in a<br>
technique in which an immersed portion is a calorized pipe<br>
coated with a refractory, an oxygen source is mainly iron<br>
oxide, and the oxygen gas ratio, that is, the ratio of the<br>
oxygen gas supply to the total oxygen gas supply (iron oxide<br>
(in terms of oxygen gas) + oxygen gas) is in the range of<br>
20% to 30% at most. At an oxygen gas ratio of more than<br>
these values (that is, if the oxygen gas flow rate is<br>
increased, or if only an oxygen gas is blown), the oxidation<br>
reaction is too exothermic for the single-tube structure to<br>
withstand. The oxygen gas ratio is preferably 100% to<br>
effectively utilize heat generated by the oxidation reaction.<br>
However, in this technique, the injection lance does not<br>
have sufficient durability to withstand the blowing of an<br><br><br>
oxygen gas alone.<br>
In the technique disclosed in Japanese Unexamined<br>
Patent Application Publication No. 58-221210, the tip part<br>
of the injection lance is cooled by endothermic<br>
decomposition of a based gas. However, the<br>
endothermic effect of the hydrocarbon-based gas is mainly<br>
achieved at the tip (or at the very end), that is, a nozzle,<br>
and does not contribute to the cooling of the refractory<br>
that coats the injection lance. Thus, the refractory itself<br>
must secure durability in a different way. However,<br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 58-<br>
221210 does not disclose specific composition of the<br>
refractory.<br>
Furthermore, Japanese Unexamined Utility Model<br>
Registration Application Publication No. 6-6447 and Japanese<br>
Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 58-221210 take<br>
no measure against physical cracks or detachment (spalling)<br>
of the refractory caused by vibrations of the injection<br>
lance by a blowing process.<br>
Concerning vibrations of the injection lance, Japanese<br>
Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 54-23019<br>
discloses a technique of providing the tip of the injection<br>
lance with a horizontal portion to reduce the reaction force<br>
of blowing, thus reducing the stress acting on the immersed<br>
portion. However, blowing of a large amount of oxygen gas<br><br><br>
generates strong vibrations of the whole injection lance<br>
equipment, as well as vibrations of the immersed portion.<br>
Thus, the technique cannot solve the problem thoroughly.<br>
In Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication<br>
No. 60-234908, the upper fixing apparatus of a<br>
circumferential roller disposed around the injection lance<br>
and the sandwich-type lower fixing apparatus are provided to<br>
restrain vibrations. These apparatuses are effective in a<br>
vertical injection lance. However, it is difficult to adapt<br>
the sandwich-type fixing apparatus to an inclined injection<br>
lance. In this case, vibrations cannot be restrained.<br>
Furthermore, iron ore or slag deposited on the injection<br>
lance makes the maintenance of the roller and the sandwich<br>
portion difficult.<br>
Furthermore, the pretreatment process itself has the<br>
following problems. An oxygen gas blown on the surface of a<br>
hot metal and a carbon monoxide (CO) gas generated by<br>
decarbonization of hot metal produce post combustion, which<br>
can provide thermal compensation effectively. However, in<br>
the technique according to Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 53-78913, in which an oxygen gas<br>
is blown only to the surface of a hot metal, because the CO<br>
gas is generated in small quantities, the post combustion<br>
heat cannot be produced in large quantities. The thermal<br>
compensation cannot therefore be achieved effectively.<br><br><br>
Furthermore, in the technique according to Japanese<br>
Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 61-42763, in<br>
which an oxygen gas is supplied below the surface of a hot<br>
metal, the transition from the desiliconization stage to the<br>
dephosphorization stage is accompanied by vigorous<br>
decarbonization, thus disadvantageously suppressing<br>
dephosphorization.<br>
In view of the situations described above, it is an<br>
object of the present invention to provide at least one of<br>
the following:<br>
(A)	an oxygen injection lance for blowing an oxygen gas<br>
into molten metal, such as hot metal, wherein the oxygen<br>
injection lance has high durability and a longer life time<br>

injection lance;<br>

contributes to reduction in manufacturing costs;<br>

Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The present invention will be further described below.<br><refractory for lance><br>
The present inventors have investigated the extension<br>
of life time of an oxygen injection lance in a hot-metal<br>
desiliconization process, in which the injection lance is<br>
immersed in hot metal contained in a torpedo car, and an<br>
oxygen gas is blown from the injection lance into the hot<br>
metal.<br>
The present inventors found that an oxygen injection<br>
lance having a metallic outer surface cannot resist erosion<br>
due to hot metal. It was also found that, calorizing<br>
treatment of the outer surface, as in Japanese Unexamined<br>
Utility Model Registration Application Publication No. 6-<br><br><br>
6447, has a little effect when oxygen is blown in large<br>
quantities, that is, the lance seriously wears. Thus, it<br>
was found that at least the outer surface of an immersed<br>
portion of an oxygen injection lance in hot metal must be<br>
coated with a refractory layer to improve the durability of<br>
the oxygen injection lance.<br>
It was also found that, even coated with a refractory,<br>
an immersed portion having a single-tube structure has low<br>
durability. Thus, an oxygen injection lance preferably have<br>
at least a double-tube structure and, a cooling hydrocarbon-<br>
based gas flows through a space between an inner tube and an<br>
outer tube of the double-tube structure. This is because an<br>
endothermic decomposition of the hydrocarbon-based gas was<br>
found to reduce the temperature of at least the tip part of<br>
the oxygen injection lance, thus preventing erosion of the<br>
tip part.<br>
However, these measures could not achieve intended<br>
durability. Thus, a used injection lance was examined to<br>
identify impediments to the extension of life time. The<br>
investigation showed that wear to an immersed portion of the<br>
injection lance was divided into two types: erosion due to<br>
hot metal and slag, and physical damage, that is, spalling.<br>
Further investigation showed that the cooling effect of<br>
a hydrocarbon-based gas on the erosion of the tip part of<br>
the lance was negligible except for the tip, and that the<br><br><br>
most damaged portion in the refractory coating the injection<br>
lance is not the tip but a portion that is disposed<br>
slightly apart from the tip and that does not benefit from<br>
the cooling effect of a hydrocarbon-based gas. These<br>
findings indicate that the erosion rate of a refractory<br>
coating an oxygen injection lance must be reduced to improve<br>
the durability of the oxygen injection lance. In other<br>
words, the refractory must be erosion resistant to hot metal.<br>
Accordingly, a test was performed to optimize the<br>
material of the refractory. The test was performed with an<br>
oxygen injection lance used in desiliconization of hot metal<br>
contained in a torpedo car. Figs. 1 and 3 are schematic<br>
cross-sectional views of the oxygen injection lances used in<br>
the test. Fig. 2 illustrates desiliconization of hot metal<br>
contained in a torpedo car.<br>
In Figs. 1 and 3, reference numeral 1 denotes an oxygen<br>
injection lance, reference numeral 2 denotes an inner tube,<br>
reference numeral 3 denotes an outer tube, and reference<br>
numeral 4 denotes a refractory coating layer formed of a<br>
refractory concrete (cementitious refractory that is<br>
formable into a target shape; for example, a castable<br>
refractory). In Fig. 1, the refractory coating layer 4<br>
includes a refractory of tip part 4A and a refractory of<br>
body part 4B, each formed of different refractories. An<br>
oxygen gas flows through the inner tube 2. A hydrocarbon-<br><br><br>
based gas flows through a space between the inner tube 2 and<br>
the outer tube 3. The oxygen gas and the hydrocarbon-based<br>
gas are blown from the tip part 1A of the oxygen injection<br>
lance 1 into hot metal. Reference numeral 1C denotes the<br>
center of the lance. Reference numeral 7 denotes a bend<br>
part (defined by an intersection point of the center lines<br>
of the lance in front of and to the rear of the bend).<br>
In Fig. 2, reference numeral 5 denotes a torpedo car.<br>
Reference numeral 6 denotes hot metal. The tip 1A of the<br>
oxygen injection lance 1 illustrated in Fig. 1 or 3 is<br>
immersed in the hot metal 6 contained in the torpedo car 5.<br>
To perform desiliconization of the hot metal 6, an oxygen<br>
gas (if necessary, together with a refining agent) is blown<br>
from the inner tube 2, and a hydrocarbon-based gas is blown<br>
from the space between the inner tube 2 and the outer tube 3'.<br>
In this hot-metal desiliconization process, the<br>
composition of the refractory coating layer 4 (or the<br>
refractory of tip part 4A and the refractory of body part<br>
4B) was changed to examine the durability of the oxygen<br>
injection lance 1. In the test, to perform the<br>
desiliconization process, an oxygen gas was blown at a flow<br>
rate of 30 Nm3/min from the inner tube 2 into about 300 tons<br>
of hot metal 6 contained in the torpedo car 5, and a propane<br>
gas was blown at a flow rate in the range of 2 to 5 Nm3/min<br>
from the space between the inner tube 2 and the outer tube 3<br><br>
into the hot metal 6. The unit Nm3 means the volume<br>
expressed in m3 under standard condition. The inner tube 2<br>
and the outer tube 3 were stainless steel pipes. Table 1<br>
shows the test conditions in the desiliconization process.<br><br>
The test was performed using an Al2O3-SiO2-based<br>
castable refractory (Al2O3-20% by mass of SiO2) and an A12O3-<br>
MgO-based castable refractory as the refractory coating<br>
layer 4 of the lance illustrated in Fig. 3. In the Al2O3-<br>
MgO-based castable refractory, the MgO content was set to be<br><br><br>
3%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, or 70% by mass to examine<br>
the effect of the MgO content on the wear rate of the<br>
refractory coating layer 4. In the lance illustrated in Fig.<br>
1, an Al2O3-7% by mass of MgO castable refractory was used as<br>
the refractory of tip part 4A, and an Al2O3-20% by mass of<br>
SiO2 castable refractory was used as the refractory of body<br>
part 4B. An interface between the tip part and the body<br>
part was located at the hot metal surface, the position of<br>
the bend part, or the midpoint (center) therebetween. The<br>
hot metal surface is not the surface of slag, but the<br>
surface of hot metal itself. Table 2 shows the test results.<br><br><br>
As shown in Table 2, the Al2O3-20% by mass of SiO2<br>
castable refractory had a wear rate of.200 mm per charge<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "mm/ch"). However, the Al2O3-<br>
MgO-based castable refractories containing 5% to 30% by mass<br>
of MgO had a wear rate of 15 mm/ch or less. However, the<br>
Al2O3-MgO-based castable refractory containing less than 5%<br>
by mass of MgO had a large wear rate, and the effect of MgO<br><br><br>
was small. On the other hand, the Al2O3-MgO-based castable<br>
refractories containing more than 30% by mass of MgO had<br>
noticeable cracks in the refractory coating layer 4 because<br>
of high Young's moduli of the refractories. An improvement<br>
in durability could not be expected owing to the cracks<br>
caused by spalling.<br>
These results show that the Al2O3-MgO-based refractory<br>
concretes containing 5% to 30% by mass of MgO are optimum<br>
refractories for the refractory coating layer 4. Use of<br>
these refractory concretes can improve the durability of the<br>
oxygen injection lance 1.<br>
Furthermore, use of an Al2O3-MgO refractory concrete at<br>
the tip part and an Al2O3-SiO2-based refractory concrete at<br>
the body part yielded the best result, and had a wear rate<br>
lower than those of the oxygen injection lances 1 coated<br>
only with the Al2O3-MgO refractory concretes. The reason for<br>
that is considered as described below. Al2O3-SiO2-based<br>
refractory concretes basically have spalling resistance<br>
higher than that of the Al2O3-MgO-based refractory concretes<br>
having an appropriate composition described above. In<br>
particular, the Al2O3-SiO2-based refractory concretes are<br>
resistant to thermal shock generated just above the hot<br>
metal surface. An Al2O3-SiO2-based refractory concrete at<br>
the body part therefore further improves the durability of<br>
the lance.<br><br><br>
Furthermore, the present inventors also tested Al2O3-<br>
Cr2O3-based, Al2O3-ZrO2-based, and SiO2-ZrO2-based<br>
refractories, alone or in combination. However, these<br>
refractories are not as effective as the refractories<br>
according to present invention.<br>
The present invention is based on these test results.<br>
As illustrated in Figs. 1 and 3, an oxygen injection lance 1<br>
for refining according to invention has a double-tube<br>
structure composed of an inner tube 2 and an outer tube 3.<br>
An oxygen gas (if necessary, together with a refining agent)<br>
is blown from the inner tube 2, and a hydrocarbon-based gas<br>
is blown from a space between the inner tube 2 and the outer<br>
tube 3. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the outer surface of the<br>
outer tube 3 is coated entirely with an Al2O3-MgO-based<br>
refractory concrete containing 5% to 30% by mass of MgO.<br>
Alternatively, as illustrated in Fig. 1, the tip part is<br>
coated with an Al2O3-MgO-based refractory concrete, and the<br>
remaining body part is coated with an Al2O3-SiO2-based<br>
refractory concrete.<br>
Also in the oxygen injection lance 1 illustrated in Fig.<br>
1, the Al2O3-MgO-based refractory concrete at the tip part<br>
contains 5% to 30% by mass of MgO. The Al2O3-SiO2-based<br>
refractory concrete is effective when it contains 10% to 40%<br>
by mass of SiO2. In terms of spalling resistance, the<br>
refractory of body part 4B preferably coats an outer surface<br><br><br>
area of the lance 1 at least extending to the hot metal<br>
surface. Preferably, the refractory of tip part 4A coats a<br>
sufficient area to resist erosion. For example, in the<br>
lance illustrated in Fig. 1, the refractory of tip part 4A<br>
coats an outer surface area of the lance 1 at least<br>
extending to a bend part 7. In other words, in the lance<br>
illustrated in Fig. 1, an interface between the refractory<br>
of tip part 4A and the refractory of body part 4B is<br>
preferably located between the bend part and the hot metal<br>
surface.<br>
Preferably, the refractory of tip part 4A and the<br>
refractory of body part 4B are continuously formed at the<br>
interface. This is easily achieved by forming a mold around<br>
the outer tube 3 and pouring a refractory concrete into the<br>
mold to coat the lance while changing the type of refractory.<br>
An Al2O3-MgO-based refractory concrete and an Al2O3-SiO2-<br>
based refractory concrete for use in the present invention-<br>
may contain about 7% or less of impurities without causing<br>
any problem. In both of the lances illustrated in Figs. 1<br>
and 3, in terms of spalling resistance, the MgO content in<br>
the Al2O3-MgO-based refractory concrete is most preferably in<br>
the range of 5% to 10% by mass. Preferably, the refractory<br>
layer has a thickness of at least about 25 mm.<br>
An oxygen injection lance 1 for refining according to<br>
the present invention may be applied to any refining in<br><br><br>
which an oxygen gas or an oxygen gas together with a<br>
refining agent is supplied to molten metal. The oxygen<br>
injection lance 1 is most suitably used as an oxygen gas-<br>
supply means in a hot-metal desiliconization process. This<br>
is because an Al2O3-MgO-based refractory concrete containing<br>
5% to 30% by mass of MgO used in the refractory coating<br>
layer 4 or the refractory of tip part 4A in the present<br>
invention has high erosion resistance to SiO2-based slag,<br>
which is produced in the hot-metal desiliconization process.<br>
The refining agent, as used herein, refers to iron oxide or<br>
flux, such as lime (lime powder) or limestone, serving as an<br>
oxygen source.<br>
Furthermore, a lance according to the present invention<br>
is suitable for applications in which a large amount of<br>
oxygen (for example, at least 10 Nm3/min, preferably at<br>
least 15 Nm3/min) is blown to perform a process, such as a<br>
desiliconization process in a torpedo car.<br>
When an oxygen injection lance 1 for refining according<br>
to the present invention is used to perform desiliconization<br>
of the hot metal 6, the desiliconization is performed in the<br>
same way as in the test described above, that is, an oxygen<br>
gas is blown from the inner tube 2, and a hydrocarbon-based<br>
gas is blown from the space between the inner tube 2 and the<br>
outer tube 3. In this case, the oxygen injection lance 1<br>
may be used in combination with another oxygen gas-supply<br><br><br>
means, such as oxygen-gas supply with a nonimmersed-type<br>
top-blowing lance. Furthermore, in the oxygen injection<br>
lance 1 for refining illustrated in Fig. 1 or 3, while the<br>
inner tube 2 and the outer tube 3 are unbranched to the tip<br>
part 1A, the inner tube 2 and the outer tube 3 may be<br>
branched in the vicinity of the tip such as T-shaped<br>
or Y-shaped. Fig. 12 illustrates a T-shaped lance according<br>
to another embodiment of the present invention. The<br>
reference numerals are the same as in Fig. 1. The usage of<br>
the T-shaped lance is also the same as the lance illustrated<br>
in Fig. 1 except that the T-shaped lance is vertically<br>
immersed in hot metal. In the lance illustrated in Fig. 12,<br>
to reduce erosion sufficiently, the refractory of tip part<br>
4A coats the lance from the tip to at least a position<br>
located at a distance twice the distance d between the<br>
center 1C of the opening of the lance and the tip of the<br>
lance. That is, the interface between the refractory of tip<br>
part 4A and the refractory of body part 4B is preferably<br>
located between the hot metal surface and the position<br>
located at a distance of 2d from the tip of the lance. This<br>
also applies to a Y-shaped lance.<br>
The inner tube 2 and the outer tube 3 are not<br>
necessarily a stainless steel pipe, and may be a carbon<br>
steel pipe. Furthermore, to reduce the flow rate of the<br>
oxygen gas blown from the inner tube 2, the oxygen gas may<br><br><br>
be combined with an inert gas, such as a nitrogen gas or an<br>
Ar gas. Alternatively, an oxygen-containing gas, such as<br>
oxygen-rich air, may be used if necessary. The oxygen<br>
content may be determined appropriately by the required<br>
amount of oxygen. In association with variations in flow<br>
rate of the oxygen gas blown from the inner tube 2, the<br>
hydrocarbon-based gas blown from the outer tube 3 may be<br>
combined with an inert gas, such as a nitrogen gas or an Ar<br>
gas, to reduce the flow rate of the hydrocarbon-based gas.<br>
As a standard, the amount of hydrocarbon gas is preferably<br>
in the range of about 5% to 20% by volume of oxygen supplied<br>
from the inner tube 2. Examples of the hydrocarbon gas<br>
include propane (C3H8) , methane (CH4) , ethane (C2H6) , and<br>
butane (C4H10) . Since these gases decompose at relatively<br>
low temperatures and have a large endothermic heat of<br>
decomposition, they are conveniently used in steelmaking<br>
processes.<br><shape of lance><br>
The present inventors then investigated the improvement<br>
in the shape of a lance immersed in molten metal, at an angle<br>
with respect to the molten metal surface. More specifically,<br>
in a container, such as a torpedo car, that has a small<br>
opening area in relation to the volume of hot metal, it is<br>
advantageous to immerse a lance in hot metal at an angle<br><br><br>
with respect to the hot metal surface in terms of pervasive<br>
agitation. However, adverse effects of vibrations are<br>
greater than a vertically immersed lance.<br>
Thus, to prevent spalling of an immersed portion of an<br>
injection lance, a horizontal portion was formed at a tip of<br>
the injection lance, and the length of the horizontal<br>
portion was altered experimentally. In the experiment using<br>
the lance illustrated in Fig. 1 or 3, as illustrated in Fig.<br>
7, the length (L) of a horizontal portion 1B was altered<br>
within the range of zero to three times the outer diameter<br>
(D) of the oxygen injection lance 1. The length (L) of the<br>
horizontal portion 1B is defined by the length of an axis of<br>
the inner tube 2. In Fig. 7, reference numeral 20 denotes<br>
an iron slat (described below).<br>
In the test, to perform desiliconization, an oxygen gas<br>
was blown at a flow rate of 30 Nm3/min from the inner tube 2<br>
into about 300 tons of hot metal contained in a torpedo car,<br>
and a propane gas was blown at a flow rate in the range of 2<br>
to 5 Nm3/min from the space between the inner tube 2 and the<br>
outer tube 3 into the hot metal. The inner tube 2 and the<br>
outer tube 3 were stainless steel pipes. A refractory<br>
coating layer 4 was the same as No. 10 in Table 2, that is,<br>
a combination of an Al2O3-5% by mass of MgO castable<br>
refractory and an Al2O3-20% by mass of SiO2 castable<br>
refractory. The refractory coating layer 4 has a thickness<br><br>
of 35 mm. The inclination angle (angle between the lance<br>
(body part) and the hot metal surface) of the oxygen<br>
injection lance 1 immersed in the hot metal surface was 65°.<br>
The angle between the horizontal portion 1B and the hot<br>
metal surface was about 0°.<br>
The test conditions of the desiliconization process was<br>
the same as in Table 1. Table 3 shows the damage of the<br>
immersed portion at different lengths (L) of the horizontal<br>
portion IB.<br><br>
As shown in Table 3, the wear rate was 8 mm/ch or less<br>
at a length (L) of the horizontal portion 1B 0.5 to 2.0<br><br><br>
times the outer diameter (D) of the oxygen injection lance 1,<br>
indicating further improvement over the results shown in<br>
Table 2. The length of the horizontal portion 1B in the<br>
experiment shown in Table 2 was 0.4 times the outer diameter<br>
D.<br>
By contrast, when no horizontal portion 1B was provided<br>
or when the length (L) of the horizontal portion 1B was 0.3<br>
times the outer diameter (D) of the oxygen injection lance 1,<br>
the wear rate was in the range of 9 to 10 mm/ch at the<br>
maximum. In these cases, the horizontal portion 1B had no<br>
vibration restraining effect (the lance was easily affected<br>
by a force from the hot metal), and the life time before<br>
spalling occurs was not improved significantly. When the<br>
length (L) of the horizontal portion 1B was at least 2.5<br>
times the outer diameter (D) of the oxygen injection lance 1,<br>
the wear rate was in the range of 10 to 12 mm/ch at the<br>
maximum. In this case, a crack in a nonimmersed portion of<br>
the oxygen injection lance 1 was a bottleneck.<br>
These results show that the optimum length (L) of the<br>
horizontal portion 1B is 0.5 to 2.0 times the outer diameter<br>
(D) of the oxygen injection lance 1, and the durability of<br>
the oxygen injection lance 1 is improved in this range.<br>
Thus, the length (L) of the horizontal portion 1B can<br>
be adjusted to an appropriate value to restrain vibrations<br>
due to the blowing of an oxygen gas. This can prevents<br><br><br>
spalling of the immersed portion of the oxygen injection<br>
lance 1 and the generation of cracks in the nonimmersed<br>
portion of the oxygen injection lance 1, thus allowing<br>
stable blowing of an oxygen gas.<br>
A present invention is based on these test results. An<br>
injection lance 1 for refining according to the present<br>
invention has a refractory concrete coating layer 4 (or 4A<br>
and 4B) at the outer surface, and is immersed in a molten<br>
metal at an angle with respect to the molten metal surface.<br>
The injection lance 1 has a horizontal portion 1B in the tip<br>
part thereof. The horizontal portion 1B has a length 0.5 to<br>
2.0 times the outer diameter of the injection lance 1.<br>
The inclination angle of the lance is preferably in the<br>
range of 45° to 85° and more preferably in the range of 60°<br>
to 85°. Furthermore, the horizontal portion forms an angle<br>
in the range of -20° to +20°, preferably 0°, with the hot<br>
metal surface (horizontal plane).<br><lance equipment for restraining the lance></lance>
vibration)&gt;<br>
As described above, it is preferable to optimize the<br>
refractory or the shape of an injection lance to increase<br>
the life time of the injection lance. Furthermore, it is<br>
also effective to restrain vibrations of the lance<br>
efficiently and at low cost to increase the life time of the<br><br><br>
injection lance.<br>
More specifically, an increase in oxygen gas supply,<br>
for example, use of only an oxygen gas as an oxygen source<br>
in desiliconization, increases vibrations of an injection<br>
lance and wear due to spalling. Vibrations of an injection<br>
lance may cause cracks in or falling off of a refractory<br>
coating layer at a nonimmersed portion, as well as at an<br>
immersed portion, of the injection lance. Furthermore,<br>
vibrations of an injection lance may cause cracks in an<br>
apparatus for lifting and lowering the lance. The injection<br>
lance may reach the end of its life time due to these<br>
defects. These defects may also lead to destruction of the<br>
equipment. On the basis of these findings, to improve the<br>
durability of an injection lance, it is effective and<br>
desired to restrain vibrations of not only the injection<br>
lance, but also the whole injection lance equipment,<br>
including a holder for holding the injection lance and a<br>
lifting and lowering apparatus for lifting and lowering the<br>
holder.<br>
Thus, a measure for restraining the lance vibration was<br>
investigated to restrain vibrations of the whole injection<br>
lance equipment for refining. As a result of trial<br>
manufacture and investigations, it was found that an<br>
equipment for restraining the lance vibration can be<br>
installed at an upper end of an injection lance to restrain<br><br><br>
vibrations in the vertical direction.<br>
Injection lance equipment having an equipment for<br>
restraining the lance vibration according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention will be described below with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings. Fig. 4 is a<br>
schematic view illustrating desiliconization of hot metal<br>
contained in a torpedo car using injection lance equipment<br>
for refining according to the present invention. Fig. 5 is<br>
a schematic cross-sectional view taken along line X-X' in<br>
Fig. 4. Fig. 6 is a schematic view taken along line Y-Y' in<br>
Fig. 5.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 4, injection lance equipment 11<br>
for refining according to the present invention includes an<br>
oxygen injection lance 1 to be immersed in hot metal 6 at an<br>
angle with respect to the hot metal surface, a holder 13 for<br>
holding the oxygen injection lance 1, and a lifting and<br>
lowering apparatus 12 for lifting and lowering the holder 13.<br>
More specifically, the holder 13 is fixed to the lifting and<br>
lowering apparatus 12 via an upper portion 13A of the holder<br>
13. The lifting and lowering apparatus 12 operates to<br>
immerse the oxygen injection lance 1 in the hot metal 6<br>
contained in the torpedo car 5. The oxygen injection lance<br>
1 has a horizontally oriented horizontal portion 1B in a tip<br>
part thereof, and is coated with a refractory coating layer<br>
4 formed of a refractory concrete. A refractory coating<br><br><br>
layer may preferably have a combination structure as<br>
illustrated in Fig. 1.<br>
An equipment for restraining the lance vibration 19,<br>
which is attached to the lifting and lowering apparatus 12,<br>
is disposed directly below a joint between the holder 13 and<br>
the oxygen injection lance 1 when the oxygen injection lance<br>
1 is immersed at a predetermined position. The equipment<br>
for restraining the lance vibration 19 supports a portion of<br>
the oxygen injection lance 1 not coated with the refractory<br>
coating layer 4.<br>
Reference numeral 22 denotes a guide roller. The guide<br>
roller 22 is optional. A single guide roller 22 or a<br>
plurality of guide rollers 22 configured to guide the oxygen<br>
injection lance 1 is effective to improve the workability of<br>
replacing the oxygen injection lance 1.<br>
The equipment for restraining the lance vibration 19<br>
will be described below with reference to Figs. 5 and 6.<br>
The oxygen injection lance 1 is provided with an iron slat<br>
20 on the undersurface thereof. While the slat is<br>
preferably formed of iron in view of following aspect, the<br>
slat may be formed of a nonferrous material that has the<br>
required strength and that is of reasonable material and<br>
processing costs. Because of the location of the equipment<br>
for restraining the lance vibration, the equipment for<br>
restraining the lance vibration is susceptible to damage due<br><br><br>
to the deposition of slag or iron ore. Therefore, it is<br>
important that the equipment for restraining the lance<br>
vibration should be replaceable at low cost.<br>
The iron slat 20 can hold the oxygen injection lance 1<br>
by any means. For example, the slat 20 is fixed to the<br>
oxygen injection lance 1 by welding or as such.<br>
Alternatively, the iron slat 20 may be provided with<br>
reinforcing members 20A. More specifically, the oxygen<br>
injection lance 1 is fixed in a recessed portion defined by<br>
the two slat reinforcing members 20A and the iron slat 20 so<br>
as not to vibrate. In this case, the lance may be joined to<br>
the iron slat 20, or may be placed without joining to<br>
simplify the installation.<br>
When the oxygen injection lance 1 is not joined to the<br>
iron slat 20, the equipment for restraining the lance<br>
vibration illustrated in Fig. 5 cannot prevent vibrations of<br>
the lance in the upward direction in the drawing. Because<br>
vibration force in the upward direction in the drawing is<br>
relatively small, the oxygen injection lance 1 does not need<br>
to be joined to the iron slat 20. However, holding-down<br>
means may be provided to restrain vibrations of the lance in<br>
the upward direction in the drawing. For example, as the<br>
holding-down means, a gate hinged on a reinforcing member<br>
20A may be closed after the lance is installed.<br>
Iron slat supports 21 are disposed to the left and the<br><br><br>
right of the iron slat 20. Each of the iron slat supports<br>
21 is composed of a member 21A disposed in the vertical<br>
direction and a pair of members 21B attached to the member<br>
21A.<br>
The opposed pair of members 21B have a gap therebetween.<br>
The iron slat 20 is inserted into the gap. Thus, the iron<br>
slat supports 21 clamp and guide the iron slat 20 from both<br>
sides. In this case, preferably, the plane of the iron slat<br>
20 is parallel to the direction of immersion of the oxygen<br>
injection lance 1. Furthermore, preferably, the angle<br>
between the plane of the iron slat 20 and the molten metal<br>
surface is the same as the inclination angle of the oxygen<br>
injection lance 1 with respect to the molten metal surface.<br>
If the slat is not fixed to the lance, a jig may be provided<br>
to prevent the slat from falling before the installation of<br>
the lance. For example, as the jig for preventing the slat<br>
from falling, a stopper is installed at the lower end of the<br>
slat supp'ort members 21B illustrated in Fig. 6. While the<br>
slat support is not necessarily formed of iron, the slat<br>
support is preferably formed of iron for the same reason as<br>
the slat.<br>
Thus, the iron slat 20 is guided by the iron slat<br>
supports 21 to restrain vibrations of the oxygen injection<br>
lance 1 in the vertical direction. The equipment for<br>
restraining the lance vibration 19 is characterized by the<br><br><br>
iron slat 20 and the iron slat supports 21, and other<br>
details (for example, the structure, the design of<br>
"looseness" between the slat and the slat supports, etc.)<br>
may be determined appropriately.<br>
The injection lance equipment 11 having such a<br>
structure can restrain vibrations of the oxygen injection<br>
lance 1 in the vertical direction caused by the reaction<br>
force of blowing. This prevented the generation of cracks<br>
in and falling off of the refractory coating layer 4 at a<br>
nonimmersed portion of the injection lance 1 and the<br>
generation of cracks in the lifting and lowering apparatus<br>
12.<br>
For example, in a test using the equipment illustrated<br>
in Figs. 5 and 6 under the conditions of No. 25 in Table 3,<br>
the wear rate was 7 mm/ch or less, indicating further<br>
improvement over the results shown in Table 3.<br>
Thus, the installation of the equipment for restraining<br>
the lance vibration 19 can restrain vibrations due to the<br>
blowing of an oxygen gas. This can further prevents<br>
spalling of the immersed portion of the oxygen injection<br>
lance 1 and the generation of cracks in the nonimmersed<br>
portion of the oxygen injection lance 1 and the lifting and<br>
lowering apparatus 12, thus allowing further stable blowing<br>
of an oxygen gas.<br>
A present invention is based on these test results. The<br><br><br>
features are; the injection lance equipment 11 for blowing<br>
an oxygen gas or an oxygen gas together with a refining<br>
agent into molten metal according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention includes: the oxygen injection lance 1<br>
that has a refractory concrete coating layer 4 at the outer<br>
surface and is immersed in molten metal at an angle with<br>
respect to the molten metal surface; the holder 13 for<br>
holding the oxygen injection lance 1; and the lifting and<br>
lowering apparatus 12 for lifting and lowering the holder 13.<br>
Also the features are; the injection lance equipment 11<br>
further includes the (iron) slat 20 and the (iron) slat<br>
supports 21 as a mechanism for restraining vibrations of the<br>
injection lance, the (iron) slat 20 holds an upper end of<br>
the oxygen injection lance 1, and the (iron) slat supports<br>
21 are disposed on the lifting and lowering apparatus 12 and<br>
clamp the (iron) slat 20. Preferably, the plane of the slat<br>
20 is parallel to the direction of immersion of the oxygen<br>
injection lance 1. Furthermore, preferably, the angle<br>
between the plane of the slat 20 and the molten metal<br>
surface is the same as the inclination angle of the oxygen<br>
injection lance 1 with respect to the molten metal surface.<br>
Preferably, the slat 20 is guided by the slat supports 21 to<br>
restrain vibrations of the oxygen injection lance 1<br>
particularly in the vertical direction.<br>
Injection lance equipment 11 for refining according to<br><br><br>
the present invention may be applied to any refining in<br>
which an oxygen gas or an oxygen gas together with a<br>
refining agent is supplied to molten metal. The injection<br>
lance equipment 11 is most suitably used as an oxygen gas-<br>
supply means in a hot-metal desiliconization process. This<br>
is because the present invention can be applied to a<br>
desiliconization process to generate a heat capacity, which<br>
can be utilized to melt scrap iron. The -refining agent, as<br>
used herein, refers to iron oxide or flux, such as calcium<br>
oxide, which serves as an oxygen source.<br>
Points to note in desiliconization of the hot metal 6<br>
using the injection lance equipment 11 for refining<br>
according to the present invention are the same as those in<br>
the case of using injection lance according to the present<br>
invention.<br><hot-metal pretreatment process><br>
A hot-metal pretreatment process according to the<br>
present invention will be described below with reference to<br>
drawings.<br>
Fig. 8 illustrates a pretreatment facility according to<br>
an embodiment of the present invention. Reference numeral 5<br>
denotes a torpedo car that contains hot metal 6 tapped from<br>
a blast furnace (not shown). A top-blowing lance 26 and<br>
injection lance equipment 11 are installed in the torpedo<br><br><br>
car 5 and can move horizontally and vertically.<br>
The top-blowing lance 26 blows an oxygen gas on the<br>
surface 6A of the hot metal 6 in the torpedo car 5. The<br>
oxygen gas supplied by the top-blowing lance 26 is<br>
hereinafter referred to as a top-blown oxygen gas.<br>
The injection lance equipment 11 blows an oxygen gas<br>
into the hot metal 6 and supplies solid oxygen, such as iron<br>
oxide, into the hot metal 6. The oxygen gas supplied by the<br>
injection lance equipment 11 is hereinafter referred to as<br>
an injection oxygen gas.<br>
After pretreatment of the hot metal 6, the torpedo car<br>
5	moves to a converter (not shown) and charges the hot metal<br>
6	into the converter.<br>
A hot-metal pretreatment process according to the<br>
present embodiment will be described below with reference to<br>
Figs. 9 and 10.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 9, in a desiliconization stage<br>
of an early stage of the pretreatment process, the injection<br>
lance equipment 11 supplies solid oxygen and an injection<br>
oxygen gas, and the top-blowing lance 26 supplies a top-<br>
blown oxygen gas. Furthermore, in a dephosphorization stage<br>
after the desiliconization stage, the injection oxygen gas<br>
is stopped, and the solid oxygen and the top-blown oxygen<br>
gas are supplied continuously.<br>
An increase in the oxygen supply rate of solid oxygen<br><br>
and injection oxygen gas (hereinafter referred to as the<br>
total oxygen supply rate) supplied to the torpedo car 5 in<br>
the desiliconization stage may result in an abrupt reaction<br>
of carbon in the hot metal 6, causing splashes and the<br>
gushing of splashes from a tap hole of the torpedo car 5,<br>
that is, slopping. Thus, the present inventors investigated<br>
the total oxygen supply rate of the solid oxygen and the<br>
injection oxygen gas. The present inventors examined the<br>
relationship between the incidence of slopping in the<br>
desiliconization stage and the total oxygen supply rate<br>
using the hot metal 6 having a composition shown in Table 4.<br><br>
Fig. 10 shows the relationship. No slopping occurred at<br>
a total oxygen supply rate of less than 0.23 Nm3/t/min.<br>
However, the incidence of slopping increased at a total<br><br>
oxygen supply rate of 0.23 Nm3/t/min or more. The total<br><br>
oxygen supply rate in the desiliconization stage was<br>
therefore set to be less than 0.23 Nm3/t/min.<br><br><br>
The function and effect of a hot-metal pretreatment<br>
process according to the present embodiment will be<br>
described below with reference to Figs. 8 to 11. Fig. 11<br>
shows changes in concentration of carbon (C), silicon (Si),<br>
and phosphorus (P) in the hot metal 6 in the<br>
desiliconization stage and the dephosphorization stage.<br>
As shown in Fig. 11, in the desiliconization stage, the<br>
concentration of silicon in the hot metal 6 decreases<br>
greatly.<br>
The solid oxygen and the injection oxygen gas supplied<br>
from the injection lance equipment 11 into the hot metal 6<br>
produce a sufficient amount of CO gas by decarbonization of<br>
the hot metal 6. The sufficient amount of CO gas generated<br>
from the hot metal 6 reacts with the top-blown oxygen gas<br>
supplied from the top-blowing lance 26 on the surface 6A of<br>
the hot metal 6, generating a large amount of post<br>
combustion heat. Thus, in the desiliconization stage, the<br>
large amount of post combustion heat can provide thermal<br>
compensation effectively.<br>
Furthermore, as described above, since the total oxygen<br>
supply rate in the desiliconization stage is set to be less<br>
than 0.23 Nm3/t/min, the gushing of splashes from a tap hole<br>
of the torpedo car 5, that is, slopping can be prevented.<br>
On the other hand, in the present embodiment, in the<br>
dephosphorization stage after the desiliconization stage,<br><br><br>
the injection oxygen gas is stopped, and the solid oxygen<br>
and the top-blown oxygen gas are supplied continuously. In<br>
the present embodiment, the solid oxygen blown into the hot<br>
metal 6 reacts preferentially with [P] in the hot metal<br>
rather than [C] , thus reducing decarbonization. Accordingly,<br>
as shown by line C in Fig. 11, the carbon concentration<br>
decreases relatively slowly. By contrast, in a conventional<br>
method in which an injection oxygen gas is supplied into hot<br>
metal 6 from the early period of the dephosphorization stage,<br>
the oxygen gas reacts preferentially with [C] in the hot<br>
metal rather than [P] . Accordingly, as shown by line C in<br>
Fig. 11, the carbon concentration decreases relatively<br>
rapidly. This results in an insufficient heat capacity in<br>
the subsequent decarbonization process.<br>
Thus, in the dephosphorization stage according to the<br>
present embodiment, dephosphorization occurs relatively<br>
faster than decarbonization, thereby ensure reduction of the<br>
phosphorus concentration, as shown by line P in Fig. 11. By<br>
contrast, in a conventional method in which an injection<br>
oxygen gas is supplied into hot metal 6 from the early<br>
period of the dephosphorization stage, decarbonization<br>
occurs relatively faster than dephosphorization.<br>
Accordingly, as shown by line P' in Fig. 11, the phosphorus<br>
concentration in the hot metal 6 does not decrease rapidly.<br>
Thus, in the desiliconization stage according to the<br><br><br>
present embodiment, the solid oxygen and the injection<br>
oxygen gas are supplied into the hot metal 6, and the top-<br>
blown oxygen gas is blown on the surface 6A of the hot metal<br>
6. Furthermore, in the dephosphorization stage, the<br>
injection oxygen gas is stopped, and the solid oxygen and<br>
the top-blown oxygen gas are supplied. Thus, thermal<br>
compensation can be provided effectively, and impurities can<br>
be removed efficiently.<br>
The desiliconization stage and the dephosphorization<br>
stage -can be distinguished by measurement of the exhaust gas<br>
temperature with a dust collection system of the torpedo car<br>
5 or by sampling. For example, a sudden rise in exhaust gas<br>
temperature indicates the completion of the desiliconization<br>
stage.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
The injection lance equipment for refining illustrated<br>
in Fig. 4 and the injection lance illustrated in Figs. 1 and<br>
7 were used in the hot-metal desiliconization process in a<br>
torpedo car (see Table 5). The equipment for restraining<br>
the lance vibration illustrated in Figs. 5 and 6 was used in<br>
some examples (inventive examples 3, 5, and 6), but was not<br>
used in the other examples (inventive examples 1, 2, and 4).<br>
The inclination angle of the lance was 70° In inventive<br><br><br>
example 7, a T-shaped lance illustrated in Fig. 12 was<br>
immersed vertically in hot metal.<br>
A refractory coating layer of the oxygen injection<br>
lance was formed of an Al2O3-10% by mass of MgO castable<br>
refractory (inventive example 1) , or an Al2O3-7% by mass of<br>
MgO castable refractory from the tip to the hot metal level<br>
and an Al2O3-20% by mass of SiO2 castable refractory above<br>
the hot metal level (inventive examples 2 to 7).<br>
In the desiliconization process, a propane gas was<br>
blown from a space between an inner tube and an outer tube,<br>
while an oxygen gas was blown from the inner tube.<br>
Desiliconization of 36 to 51 charges was performed. A<br>
horizontal portion at the tip of the injection lance had a<br>
length (L) 0.3 to 1.0 time the outer diameter (D).<br>
For purposes of comparison, desiliconization was<br>
performed using different refractory coating layers or blown<br>
gases (see Table 6) . In some comparative examples, instead<br>
of oxygen gas, iron oxide (iron ore) in a nitrogen carrier<br>
gas was blown as an oxygen source from the inner tube<br>
(comparative examples 5 and 6). The oxygen content in iron<br>
oxide was 0.15 Nm3 of oxygen gas per kilogram of iron oxide<br>
as determined by chemical analysis. The oxygen flow rate<br>
was maintained constant.<br>
Conditions for inventive examples and comparative<br>
examples were identical, except for the conditions described<br><br><br>
in Tables 5 and 6.<br>
In the inventive examples and the comparative examples,<br>
the life time of an oxygen injection lance and the<br>
temperature of hot metal were evaluated. Tables 5 and 6<br>
show the test conditions and the test results.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
- 49 -<br>
In the inventive examples, when oxygen was blown at 30<br>
Nm3/min with an inclined lance, the life time of a <br>
lance was in the range of 6.5 to 8.5 charges per lance<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "ch/lance") on an average,<br>
(inventive examples 1 to 5), and good results were also<br>
obtained under other conditions. Furthermore, when an<br>
oxygen gas was used as an oxygen source in desiliconization,<br>
removal of 0.01% by mass of silicon in hot metal by<br>
oxidation increased the temperature of hot metal by about<br>
3°C.<br>
Furthermore, use of a composite coating layers<br>
increases the life time of a lance (inventive example 1 vs.<br>
inventive example 2). The life time of a lance is also<br>
improved at a length of front horizontal portion 0.5 to 2.0<br>
times the outer diameter (inventive example 2 vs. inventive<br>
example 4). Use of an equipment for restraining the lance<br>
vibration further improves the life time of a lance<br>
(inventive example 4 vs. inventive example 5).<br>
On the other hand, when an oxygen injection lance was<br>
coated with a refractory coating layer of an Al2O3-20% by<br>
mass of SiO2 castable refractory, and the other<br>
desiliconization conditions were the same as in the<br>
inventive example 5 (comparative example 1), the erosion was<br>
large, and the life time of a lance was 1.0 ch. Also in a<br>
vertical immersion lance, use of an Al2O3-20% by mass of SiO2<br><br><br>
castable refractory for the refractory layer greatly reduces<br>
the life time of a lance (inventive example 7 vs.<br>
comparative example 7).<br>
Furthermore, following was confirmed. When an Al2O3-20%<br>
by mass of SiO2 castable refractory was used as a refractory<br>
layer, when, instead of an oxygen gas, iron oxide (iron ore)<br>
in a nitrogen carrier gas was blown as an oxygen source from<br>
the inner tube, and when a nitrogen gas was blown from the<br>
space between the inner tube and the outer tube, although<br>
the life time of a lance was acceptable, heat was absorbed<br>
as sensible heat of the iron oxide, and the temperature of<br>
hot metal was reduced (this increases energy to compensate<br>
the insufficient heat capacity in a downstream process)<br>
(comparative examples 5 and 6).<br>
When an Al2O3-MgO-based castable refractory containing<br>
more than 30% by mass of MgO was used, alone or in<br>
combination, as a refractory layer, the life time of a lance<br>
was much shorter than that in the present invention because<br>
of spalling (comparative examples 2 and 3). Even if an<br>
Al2O3-MgO-based castable refractory according to the present<br>
invention is used, when a hydrocarbon gas is not supplied<br>
from the space between the inner tube and the outer tube,<br>
the life time of a lance is reduced greatly (comparative<br>
example 4) .<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
In Table 7, a desiliconization stage of a hot-metal<br>
pretreatment process according to the present invention is<br>
compared with comparative processes different from the<br>
process according to the present invention (hereinafter<br>
referred to as comparative examples). The pretreatment<br>
facility used was that illustrated in Fig. 8. The lance<br>
equipment used was the same one as in the inventive example<br>
5 in Example 1 (Table 5). In the desiliconization stage<br>
according to the present invention, solid oxygen and an<br>
injection oxygen gas are supplied into hot metal 6, and a<br>
top-blown oxygen gas is blown on the surface 6A of the hot<br>
metal 6. In comparative example A, solid oxygen and an<br>
injection oxygen gas are supplied in the desiliconization<br>
stage. In comparative example B, solid oxygen and a top-<br>
blown oxygen gas are supplied in the desiliconization stage.<br>
A heat capacity shown in Table 7 is calculated from the<br>
carbon concentration and the temperature of hot metal before<br>
and after the desiliconization stage. A higher heat<br>
capacity is indicative of more effective thermal<br>
compensation.<br>
In comparative example A, the solid oxygen and the<br>
injection oxygen gas yield a sufficient amount of CO gas by<br>
decarbonization of hot metal. However, in the absence of a<br>
top-blown oxygen gas, the post combustion occurs in lesser<br><br><br>
quantities. Thus, comparative example A has a heat capacity<br>
smaller than those of comparative example B and the present<br>
invention.<br>
In comparative example B, the amount of CO gas<br>
generated from the hot metal is small in the presence of the<br>
solid oxygen alone. Thus, the post combustion between the<br>
CO gas and the top-blown oxygen gas cannot generate<br>
sufficient heat. The heat capacity of comparative example B<br>
is therefore smaller than that of the present invention.<br>
By contrast, in the present invention, the solid oxygen<br>
and the injection oxygen gas yield a sufficient amount of CO<br>
gas by decarbonization of hot metal. The post combustion<br>
between the CO gas and the top-blown oxygen gas generates<br>
sufficient heat at the hot metal surface. The heat is<br>
deposited in the hot metal, thus increasing the heat<br>
capacity.<br><br><br><br><br>
Table 8 shows comparisons between a process according<br>
to the present invention and processes different from the<br>
process conducted according to the present invention<br>
(hereinafter referred to as comparative examples) in a<br>
dephosphorization process after the desiliconization stage<br>
in the hot-metal pretreatment process. In the<br>
dephosphorization stage according to the present invention,<br>
solid oxygen is supplied into hot metal 6, and a top-blown<br>
oxygen gas is blown on the surface 6A of the hot metal 6.<br>
In comparative example C, solid oxygen and an injection<br>
oxygen gas are supplied to hot metal in the<br>
dephosphorization stage. In comparative example D, in the<br>
dephosphorization stage, solid oxygen and an injection<br>
oxygen gas are supplied to hot metal, and a top-blown oxygen<br>
gas is blown on the surface 6A of the hot metal 6. A heat<br>
capacity shown in Table 8 is calculated from the carbon<br>
concentration and the temperature of hot metal before and<br>
after the dephosphorization stage. As in Table 7, a higher<br>
heat capacity is indicative of more effective thermal<br>
compensation. In a process according to the present<br>
invention, since the injection oxygen gas is stopped, and<br>
the solid oxygen and the top-blown oxygen gas are supplied<br>
to hot metal, dephosphorization exceeds decarbonization, and<br>
the heat capacity increases.<br><br><br><br><br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
A gas-injection lance for refining according to the<br>
present invention can greatly reduce the rate of wear in an<br>
oxygen injection lance compared to conventional art. Thus,<br>
a single injection lance can be used to supply an oxygen gas<br>
in a refining reaction efficiently and with increased<br>
agitation force for a long period of time, without using a<br>
tuyere of a bottom-blown converter or the like. Furthermore,<br>
an oxygen gas can be blown to create a heat capacity. The<br>
heat capacity can be used to melt scrap iron, thus<br>
contributing to the reduction in CO2 emission in the<br>
production of steel materials. The extension of life time<br>
of an oxygen injection lance can reduce the frequency of<br>
replacing the lance, and increase the immersion depth of the<br>
lance.<br>
In particular, an oxygen injection lance according to<br>
the present invention can be used in a hot-metal<br>
desiliconization process to effectively utilize heat<br>
generated by desiliconization.<br>
Gas-injection lance equipment for refining according to<br>
the present invention can restrain vibrations of an<br>
injection lance while an oxygen gas is blown. This can<br>
reduce stress acting on the injection lance due to the<br>
vibrations, and prevent spalling at an immersed portion and<br>
the generation of cracks in a nonimmersed portion of the<br><br><br>
injection lance. Thus, the injection lance can have much<br>
higher durability than before. This can further improve the<br>
effects described above.<br>
In a hot-metal pretreatment process according to the<br>
present invention, solid oxygen supplied into hot metal and<br>
an oxygen gas blown into the hot metal in a desiliconization<br>
stage can yield a sufficient amount of CO gas by<br>
decarbonization of the hot metal. The sufficient amount of<br>
CO gas and an oxygen gas blown on the surface of the hot<br>
metal actively produce post combustion at the surface, thus<br>
generating a large amount of post combustion heat, which is<br>
deposited in the hot metal. This can effectively provide<br>
thermal compensation of the hot metal, and solve the<br>
problems, such as reduction in scrap ratio or an<br>
insufficient heat capacity, in decarburization refining in a<br>
converter in the next process.<br><br>
