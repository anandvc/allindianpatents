				<td>The present invention relates to a refrigerator, and more particularly, to a refrigerator having a clean cover for improving the appearance thereof<br>
In general, a refrigerator has a cooling compartment for storing food to be cooled, and a cooling system for generating cool air to be supplied into the cooling compartment. The cooling system includes a compressor for compressing refrigerant, a condenser for condensing the compressed refrigerant, and an evaporator for generating cool air by evaporating the condensed refrigerant.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6, in such a conventional refrigerator, the compressor 57 is installed on a lower rear area of a refrigerator body 53, and the condenser 55 is installed on the rear side of the body 53. The condenser 55 condenses the refrigerant by radiating heat of the refrigerant passing through it, and is installed on the rear side of the refrigerator for the effective radiation of heat.<br>
However, such a condenser 55 exposed outside makes the appearance of the refrigerator bad. Furthermore, the condenser 55 may be damaged while the refrigerator is being conveyed, because it may bump against a wall. To overcome such a problem, recently so-called clean-back type refrigerators have mainly been used.<br>
In the clean-back type refrigerator, the condenser is not disposed on the rear side of the body of the refrigerator, but is installed on a machine chamber provided in the lower rear area of the body together with the compressor. The refrigerant pipe connecting the condenser with the evaporator is disposed between the cooling compartment and the outer casing and is fixed by a foaming material filled up between<br><br>
the cooling compartment and the outer casing. A clean cover fixed by screws is assembled with the rear side of the outer casing. The clean cover covers the overall area of the rear side of the outer casing, whereby the appearance of the refrigerator is improved.<br>
However, in such conventional refrigerators, since additional fixing members such as screws have to be used in order to fix the clean cover on the rear side of the body, it is not easy to fix the clean cover, and increases the cost of manufacture. Furthermore, since the fixing members are installed along the edge of the clean cover with predetermined intervals, noise occurring in the refrigerator may leak toward the outside of the refrigerator through the gap between the rear side of the refrigerator body and the clean cover.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention has been proposed to overcome the above-described problems in the prior art, and accordingly it is the object of the present invention to provide a refrigerator capable of fixing the clean cover to the rear side of the refrigerator body without additional fixing members, and preventing leakage of noise.<br>
To achieve the above object, the present invention provides a refrigerator comprising: an inner casing for forming a cooling compartment; an outer casing disposed at an outer side of the inner casing so as to be separated from the inner casing; a clean cover disposed in a rear side of the outer casing so as to be separated from the outer casing;<br><br>
and a foaming material disposed between the inner casing and the outer casing, and between the outer casing and the clean cover, the foaming material fixing the outer casing to the inner casing and fixing the clean cover to the outer casing.<br>
The foaming material includes thermal insulation medium such as polyurethane foam, which is filled between the rear side and the cover during the insulation process in the production of refrigerator.<br><br>
The outer casing has a plurality of holes formed on the rear side thereof. The foaming material is filled up between the outer casing and the clean cover by a foaming liquid flowing out of the outer casing through the holes while the foaming liquid is being injected to the inner casing and the outer casing.<br>
Accordingly, the clean cover can be fixed onto the rear side of the outer casing without an additional fixing member, and the manufacturing cost of the refrigerator can be reduced. Furthemnore, the leakage of noise is prevented.<br>

Detailed Description of ttie Preferred Embodiment<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. FIGS. 1 through 5 show a refrigerator according to the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIGS.  1 and 2, the refrigerator has a body 2 and doors 5 and 7.    The<br><br>
body 2 is comprised of an inner casing 4 forming a pair of cooling compartments 3, and an outer casing 15 disposed on the outer side of the inner casing 4, and the doors 5 and 7 open/close the cooling compartments 3, respectively. An upper cover 21 is installed on the upper part of the body 2.<br>
The outer casing 15 is comprised of a rear plate 17 assembled on the rear side of the inner casing 4, a pair of side plates 16 respectively assembled on both sides of the inner casing 4, and an upper plate 18 assembled on the upper part of the inner casing 4. The rear plate 17 is made of PVC (Polyvinyl chloride) vvhich is manufactured by foaming. The rear plate 17 is formed with a plurality of outflow holes 33. The lower part of the rear plate 17 is bent inward, and the bent portion forms a machine chamber 25.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, in the machine chamber 25 are installed a compressor 28 for compressing refrigerant, a condenser 29 for condensing the refrigerant compressed by the compressor 28, a partition 26 for partitioning the compressor 28 and the condenser 29, and a fan 27 for dispersing heat of the condenser 29. A cover plate 22 is installed in the rear side of the machine chamber 25.<br>
Meanwhile, the upper cover 21 is installed on the upper plate 18 of the outer casing 15, and a clean cover 31 is installed on the rear plate 17.<br>
FIG. 5 is an enlarged view of the A-area of FIG. 4. As shown in FIG. 5, the inner casing 4 and the rear plate 17 of the outer casing 15, and the rear plate 17 of the outer casing 15 and the clean cover 31 are separated from each other with a predetermined intervals. Furthermore, a refrigerant pipe 14 is installed between the inner casing 4 and the rear plate 17 of the outer casing 15. An evaporator (not shown) is installed on the upper rear area of the body 2, and the refrigerant pipe 14 connects the evaporator and the condenser 29 from each other. Therefore, the refrigerant condensed in the condenser 29 is supplied into the evaporator through the refrigerant pipe 14.<br><br>
A foaming material 11 is filled up between the inner casing 4 and the rear plate 17. Therefore, the rear plate 17 is fixed onto the inner casing 4, and the refrigerant pipe 14 is fixed between the inner casing 4 and the rear plate 17. Meanwhile, the foaming material 11 is also filled up between the rear plate 17 and the clean cover 31. Thus, the clean cover 31 is fixed onto the rear plate 17.<br>
The manufacturing process of such a refrigerator is as follows.<br>
At first, a worker fixes the refrigerant pipe 14 onto the rear side of the inner casing 4, and positions the side plates 16, the rear plate 17, and the upper plate 18 on the outer side of the inner casing 4. Next, the worker positions the clean cover 31 in the rear plate 17.<br>
Then, the worker injects foaming liquid into the space between the inner casing 4 and the outer casing 15. The foaming liquid filled up between the inner casing 4 and the rear plate 17 flows out into the space between the rear plate 17 and the clean cover 31 through the outflow holes 33 formed on the rear plate 17. The foaming liquid is solidified, and then the foaming material 11 is filled up between the inner casing 4 and the rear plate 17, and between the rear plate 17 and the clean cover 31. Thereafter, the upper cover 21 is assembled with the refrigerator body 2, and the components such as the compressor 28 are installed in the machine chamber 25.<br>
As described, the clean cover 31 is fixed by the foaming liquid flowing out of the outflow holes 33 while the foaming liquid is being injected, fix the rear plate 17. Therefore, additional members for fixing the clean cover 31 are not needed, and the process for fixing the clean cover 31 becomes simple. Furthermore, since the foaming material 11 is filled up between the clean cover 31 and the rear plate 17, the leakage of noise toward the outside of the refrigerator is reduced, and the insulation of refrigerator becomes more effective.<br><br>
According to the present invention, the clean cover can be fixed onto the rear side	of the<br>
outer casing without additional fixing members and the cost of manufacture can be<br>
reduced.   Further, the noise is reduced.<br>
Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is	clearly<br>
understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not	to be<br>
taken by way of limitation, wherein the spirit and scope of the present invention is	limited<br>
only by the temis-of the appended claims.<br><br>
