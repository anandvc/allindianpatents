				<td>A COMPRESSOR SYSTEM<br>
BACK GROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a compressor system, and more particularly<br>
to a compressor system with a housing having a low pressure side containing a<br>
motor and a high pressure side containing an oil sump.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Rotary and swing link compressor systems are known in the art.<br>
These conventional systems include high pressure systems and low pressure<br>
systems in which a motor and a compressor are contained in a single<br>
chamber within a housing. In high pressure systems, the housing is provided<br>
with a suction tube that draws fluid into the compression volume of the<br>
compressor. The compressed fluid is then discharged into the chamber<br>
where it cools the motor before leaving the housing through a discharge tube.<br>
In this arrangement the chamber is maintained at the compressor discharge<br>
pressure.<br>
In low pressure systems, the chamber is maintained at the compressor<br>
suction pressure. In this arrangement the suction tube draws fluid into the<br>
chamber where it cools the motor before being drawn into the compressor<br>
suction port. The compressed fluid passes from the compression volume of<br>
the compressor out of the housing through the discharge tube.<br>
There are a number of problems associated with both conventional<br>
compressor arrangements. In high pressure systems, the motor reaches<br>
excessively high temperatures when operating in environments with high<br>
ambient temperatures. High operating temperatures lead to motor failures<br>
and a shortened operational life. In low pressure systems, difficulties arise<br>
because lubrication must be provided to the compressor at high pressure to<br>
prevent compressed fluid from leaking across the compressor"s sealing<br>
surfaces. Difficulties can also arise when trying to separate the lubricating oil<br>
from the compressed fluid.<br>
Finally, in both arrangements the motor shaft is prone to excessive<br>
vibration. High vibration levels result in high operational noise levels. Further,<br>
excessive vibration can reduce the operational life of the motor, the bearings,<br>
and the compressor. Large balance weights have been secured to the rotor<br>
in an attempt to reduce the vibration, but the added weight can result in large<br>
deflections of the rotor that further degrade system performance.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the present preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the<br>
accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers<br>
will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.<br>
As shown in Figs. 1-4, the compressor system 10 of the present<br>
invention includes a housing 12 divided into a first chamber 14 and a second<br>
chamber 16. A compressor 18 within the housing 12 draws fluid, such as<br>
refrigerant, through a suction tube 20 into the first chamber 14, and then into<br>
the compressor 18 where it compresses the fluid. The compressed fluid is<br>
then expelled from the compressor 18 into the second chamber 16, where it<br>
leaves the housing 12 through a discharge tube 22. The fluid in the first<br>
chamber 14 is thereby maintained at the compressor"s suction pressure (low<br>
pressure) and the fluid in the second chamber 16 is maintained at the<br>
compressor"s discharge pressure (high pressure). A conventional rotary<br>
compressor is shown in the drawings, but other types of compressors known<br>
in the art may be used.<br>
A motor 24, including a stator 26 and a rotor 28, used to power the<br>
compressor 18 is mounted in the first chamber 14. Placement of the motor 24<br>
in this cooler, low pressure chamber 14 allows the compressor system 10 to<br>
operate in environments with high ambient temperatures without adverse<br>
effects on the motor performance. The rotor 28 is mounted on a first end of a<br>
shaft 30. The shaft 30, which is supported by bearings 32,34, extends from<br>
the first chamber 14 into the second chamber 16.<br>
In the first embodiment of the invention, shown in Fig. 1, the internal<br>
housing space is divided into first and second chambers 14,16 by a partition<br>
plate 36a. The plate 36a can be provided with a pressure seal 38 along its<br>
interface with the housing 12 to maintain the pressure differential between the<br>
chambers 14,16. Other conventional methods of sealing the plate 36a with<br>
respect to the housing 12 are envisioned, including a press fit arrangement.<br>
In this embodiment, the compressor 18 is mounted above the partition plate<br>
36a in the first chamber 14. Upper and lower bearings 32,34 support the<br>
shaft 30, which passes through the compressor 18 and the partition plate 36a.<br>
The upper shaft bearing 32 is supported on an upper shaft bearing plate 33.<br>
The lower shaft bearing 34 can be formed integrally with the partition plate<br>
36a, as shown in Fig. 1. Alternatively, a separate bearing can be added<br>
adjacent to the plate 36a.<br>
The second embodiment of the invention is shown in Fig. 2. A partition<br>
plate 36b is again used to divide the internal housing space into first and<br>
second chambers 14,16. The plate 36b can be provided with a pressure seal<br>
38 to maintain the pressure differential between the chambers 14,16. In this<br>
embodiment, the compressor 18 is mounted below the partition plate 36b in<br>
the second chamber 16. As shown in Fig. 2, the upper shaft bearing 32 can<br>
be formed integrally with the partition plate 36b. Alternatively, a separate<br>
bearing can be added adjacent to the plate 36b. The lower shaft bearing 34 is<br>
supported on a lower shaft bearing plate 35.<br>
In the third embodiment of the invention, shown in Fig. 3, the<br>
compressor 18 itself divides the internal housing space into first and second<br>
chambers 14,16. A pressure seal 38 can be provided between the<br>
compressor 18 and the housing 12 to prevent fluid passage between the<br>
chambers 14,16, and thus maintain the pressure differential.<br>
In the fourth embodiment, shown in Fig. 4, the compressor 18 is sealed<br>
within the housing 12, such as in a press fit arrangement, to prevent fluid<br>
passage between the chambers 14,16, and thus maintain the pressure<br>
differential. While a press fit arrangement is shown, other conventional<br>
sealing arrangements would perform equally well.<br>
In the third and fourth embodiments, shown in Figs. 3 and 4,<br>
respectively, the shaft 30 is supported by upper and lower shaft bearings<br>
32,34 arranged on the compressor 18. The shaft bearings 32,34 are<br>
supported on respective shaft bearing plates 33,35.<br>
In all embodiments of the invention, fluid from the first chamber 14<br>
enters the compressor suction port 40 through a first fluid passage 42. In<br>
Figs. 1-4, the first fluid passage 42 is shown to penetrate the upper shaft<br>
bearing plate 33 or the partition plate 36b. Further, fluid from the compressor<br>
discharge port 44 enters the second chamber 16 through a second fluid<br>
passage 46. In Figs. 1-4, the second fluid passage 46 is shown to penetrate<br>
the partition plate 36a or the lower shaft bearing plate 35. It is noted that<br>
other paths for the first and second fluid passages 42,46 can be used,<br>
provided that they establish suitable fluid communication with the respective<br>
chambers 14,16.<br>
The second chamber 16 houses an oil sump 48, shown in Figs. 1-4,<br>
that serves as a reservoir for lubricating oil used by the compressor 18.<br>
Placement of the oil sump 48 in this high pressure chamber 16 facilitates both<br>
the process of supplying oil to the compressor 18 and the process of<br>
separating oil from the compressed fluid leaving the compressor 18.<br>
Lubricating oil is supplied to the compressor 18 through a passage 50<br>
in a second end of the shaft 30, which is immersed in the oil sump 48. An<br>
insert 52 with a paddle 54 is secured in the second end of the shaft 30, such<br>
that when the shaft 30 rotates, oil from the sump 48 is drawn into the passage<br>
50. As the shaft 30 rotates, the oil continues to rise in the passage 50 until it<br>
reaches oil supply holes 56 that allow the oil to be distributed to the<br>
compressor 18 for lubrication.<br>
During the compression process, the lubricating oil mixes with the fluid<br>
being compressed. To enhance the performance of the compressor system<br>
10, it is desirable to separate the oil from the compressed fluid before the fluid<br>
leaves the housing 12 through the discharge tube 22. The oil separation is<br>
carried out using a baffle 58 secured around the lower shaft bearing 34. The<br>
baffle 58, shown in Figs. 1-4, has a generally conical shape with a central<br>
opening 60, which accommodates the shaft 30 and provides an exit passage<br>
for the fluid and oil. Fluid from the compressor discharge port 44 is directed<br>
into the baffle 58, where oil in the fluid collects on the conical walls and drains<br>
through the central opening 60. The compressed fluid also passes through<br>
the central opening 60 and into the second chamber 16.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, a weighted disk 62 can be<br>
secured to the shaft 30 in the second chamber 16, as shown in Figs. 1-4. The<br>
disk 62 can function as both a shaft balancing weight and an oil separation<br>
device. As a balancing weight, the disk 62 acts to counteract eccentric loads<br>
on the shaft 30 introduced by the rotation of the rotor 28 and the operation of<br>
the compressor 18. The weighted disk 62 eliminates the need for balancing<br>
weights on the upper end of the rotor 28.<br>
The disk 62 can also be used to separate oil from the compressed<br>
fluid. The oil and compressed fluid leaving the central opening 60 of the baffle<br>
58 can be directed onto the weighted disk 62. The disk 62 centrifugally<br>
separates oil from the compressed fluid by propelling the oil outwardly onto<br>
the inner wall of the housing 12, from which it drains into the oil sump 48. The<br>
oil separation process, therefore, removes lubricating oil from the fluid leaving<br>
the compressor 18 and allows the oil to be reused.<br>
The overall operation of the compressor system 10 will now be<br>
described. Activation of the motor 24 causes the shaft 30 to rotate, which in<br>
turn activates the compressor 18 and initiates the lubrication process<br>
described above. Operation of the compressor 18 causes fluid, such as<br>
refrigerant, to be drawn into the first chamber 14 through the suction tube 20.<br>
The fluid in the first chamber 14 is thereby maintained at the compressor<br>
suction pressure. In the first chamber 14 the fluid cools the motor 18 before<br>
moving into the first fluid passage 42, from which it enters the compressor<br>
suction port 40. As the fluid is compressed, it mixes with the oil used to<br>
lubricate the compressor 18.<br>
The compressed fluid then leaves the compressor 18 through the<br>
compressor discharge port 44 and passes through the second fluid passage<br>
46 into the baffle 58. In the baffle 58, lubricating oil is separated from the<br>
compressed fluid, and the oil and fluid pass through the central opening 60<br>
into the second chamber 16. The fluid in the second chamber 16 is thereby<br>
maintained at the compressor discharge pressure.<br>
The oil and fluid can be further separated by interacting with the<br>
weighted disk 62 on the shaft 30. The compressed fluid then passes out of<br>
the second chamber 16 through the discharge tube 22. The inlet 64 of the<br>
discharge tube 22 is positioned in an upper portion of the second chamber 16<br>
to avoid drawing in oil propelled by the weighted disk 62.<br>
Other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in<br>
the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention<br>
