				<td>Field of Invention<br>
The present invention provides an eco-friendly detergent formulation useful for garment washing and stain removal. It refers to a novel, utilitarian detergent formulation that is gentle to human skin, user friendly, biodegradable and eco-friendly.<br>
It is based on natural substances commonly found in India. The preparation of the detergent involves drying, grinding, mixing and packing the components in a suitable ratio.<br>
Its application is based on commonly practiced norms.<br>
Most importantly, the product has normal shelf life and can be manufactured in a cottage industry level.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
The formulation is based on Ritha (Sapindus mukorossi Linn) as the main constituent, which does the majority of the cleaning function. To modify it, it is formulated with Citric Acid to enhance its stain removing capacity , Alum to minimize colour deterioration of the delicate garments , Besan (Cicer arietinum Linn) to impart soft touch to the hands while using the garments as well as give a soft texture to the clothes washed in it, and Nagarmotha (Cyperus rotundus Linn) to impart pleasant smell and a pleasant experience hi using the detergentThese additional ingredients are used to enhance specific properties to enable the formulation to be general purpose and broaden its application towards variety of fabrics and garments.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The main objective of the present invention is that detergent formulation is eco-friendly biodegeradable and non hazardous.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention;<br>
Today , globally, maximum people use synthetic detergents for washing clothes in their daily life. Thus a huge amount of synthetic detergents is being manufactured used and disposed into water bodies everyday. However these activities bring about a number of harmful effects on the environment.<br>
Synthetic detergents contain synthetic chemicals made from petroleum. These are usually un desirable as they possess specific local health impacts as well as are not readily biodegradable due to which they bio-accumulate in the environment<br>
Petroleum is a non-renewable source whose extraction refining, transport etc. might cause major environmental degradation.<br>
Tones of synthetic detergents are flushed hi various water bodies everyday. This increases, the amount of phosphates in the water bodies resulting to Eutrophication   in it. Thick algal<br>
blooms due to this leads to a dead water body thus disturbing the ecological balance.<br>
The synthetic detergents may affect the skin of the washer as well as the cloth being washed to some extent<br>
Banning the use of detergents can not be a practical solution as washing clothes is the basic<br>
Necessity regarding personal cleanliness. Thus preparation of a potent alternative to these detergents which would not bring about these harmful effects is a must.<br>
Present Formulation : A 'potent' alternative to synthetic detergents<br>
The Product was tested and compared with a leading, standard synthetic detergent, Multi Action Surf on the basis of various aspects. In all the tests it gave equivalent or better results than the synthetic detergents.<br>
LATHER TEST<br>
The amount of" lather formed by a detergent when shook in water is perceived as its potency towards cleaning.<br>
Thus the following test was carried out in soft as well as hard water:<br>
Tap,water [100 ml.) or Hard water[100ml.] in measuring cylinder taken.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
This test was carried out 5 times for both detergents in tap water as well as hard water and the average amount of lather formed was calculated. This average was the final reading of that particular detergent<br>
Observations<br>
Detergent used Average amount of lather formed (in tap water) Average amount of lather formed (in hard water) (Figure Removed)<br>
Conclusion:<br>
1.	The product   produces more lather than Multi Action Surf in tap Hard water(soft<br>
water).<br>
2.	The product forms more lather than Multi Action Surf in water.<br>
Since the comparative cleaning capacity of the Product and Multi Action Surf varies directly as the comparative amounts of lather formed in tap water, it can be said that the greater amount of lather formed by the product in hard water indicates its greater stain removing capacity in hard water than Multi Action Surf.<br>
•         First Wash Test<br>
In this test cloth pieces were actually washed in the each of the detergents.<br>
Both detergents were tested on a * set* of approximately equal sized pieces (10 cm X 10 cm ) of 3 types of commonly used cloth i.e. cotton, silk and polyester. 3 stains, ink, oil and phodani (oil + turmeric + cumin seeds + asafetida + curry leaves + mustard seeds ) were used in this test, being common yet hard to remove.<br>
NOTE: For convenience, in Further pages, the words ' set1 of cloth pieces" will mean: A set o£ 3 approximately equal sized cloth pieces of each of the 3 types of cloth types-Cotton, Silk, Polyester washed in the same detergent.<br>
This test was carried out in the following way:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Control of this test:<br>
Equal sized stained cloth pieces soaked in tap water (100 ml.) for half an hour and then dried.<br>
After drying, the cloth pieces, 2 observations were taken of every set of cloth pieces washed in the same detergent:<br>
[A] Stain Removing Capacity of the detergents<br>
It is extremely important for a washing substance to have a strong cleaning power This observation was taken to check the same.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Average of the stain rates calculated of cotton, silk and polyester to obtain final stain rajte indicating stain removing capacity of the detergent used for washing them.<br>
Observations<br>
Detergent used	Stain rate (oil) Stain rate (ink)Stain rate (phodani)<br>
1.	the product         8.7	9.0	7.6<br>
2.	Multi Action Surf   8.3	7.7	7.3<br>
Conclusion :<br>
The product cleans clothes more effectively as it has cleaned stains like oil and phodni, which are considered to be the strongest ones, more effectively than Multi Action Surf.<br>
The control sample of one of the three types of cloth (cotton, silk or polyester) exposed to Ultra Violet Rays in the Spectrophotometer.<br>
Tested (i.e. washed in a the product or Multi action Surf) sample of the same type of<br>
cloth exposed to Ultra Violet Rays in the Spectrophotometer.<br>
Colour deterioration of the tested sample obtained numerically on<br>
the computer screen of the computer attached to the Spectrophotometer.<br>
Average of the amounts of colour deterioration of cotton, silk and polyester<br>
calculated to obtain final amount indicating average colour deterioration of clothes due to ihe<br>
detergent they were washed with.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The product retains more colour than Multi Action Surf.<br>
Repeated Application Test<br>
It is very important to see the effect on a cloth -which is repeatedly washed by a particular substance. This test was particularly carried out to observe this specific effect.<br>
It is known that if a reaction is carried out at a temperature 10 degree Celcius more than the room temperature, the results obtained are equivalent to those obtained when we carry out the same reaction on the same material 10-15 times. This principle was used in this test. In this test, too, every substance was tested on a set of approximately equal sized pieces of Cotton, Silk and Polyester, because, the survey taken had stated that these were the most commonly used types of cloth.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Control of this test<br>
Non-stained approximately equal sized pieces Cotton, Silk and Polyester soaked in tap water (100 ml) at a temperature 10 degree Celsius more than the room temperature for half an hour and then dried.<br>
After drying, 2 observations were taken of every "set of cloth pieces": [A] Tensile Strength/Fabric mechanical strength of clothes washed in the detergents:<br>
It is very important to see whether the strength of the fibre of a cloth and in turn the strength of the cloth is affected after repeatedly by a particular detergent. This observation was taken for the same purpose.<br>
The following method was used for every "set of cloth pieces":<br>
(Formula Removed)										Average of the amounts of weight needed to break the 3 threads calculated to obtain ar amount of weight indicating the average tensile strength of that particular cloth piece tc which the 3 threads belonged to. 								Average of the amounts of weight indicating the tensile strength<br>
of Cotton, Silk and Polyester calculated to obtain final amount of weight<br>
indicating average tensile strength of clothes washed in that particular detergent<br>
Observations:<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Conclusion<br>
The tensile strength of cloth pieces washed repeatedly in the final product is more than those washed repeatedly in Multi Action Surf.<br>
[B]   Colour Deterioration due to the detergents:<br>
This test was taken to check whether the colour of clothes washed repeatedly by a particular substance.<br>
This test was taken in the same way, using the spectrophotometer, as done in test [2] L e. The First Wash Test,<br>
Observations:<br><br>
 (Figure Removed)<br><br>
Conclusion:<br>
The final product retains more colour of cloth pieces repeatedly washed in it than those washed repeatedly Multi Action Surf.<br>
[C]      Texture of clothes washed in the detergent<br>
This was carried out in the same way as the Stain Removing Capacity Observation but instead of rating the stains, the texture of the cloth repeatedly washed in a substance was rated.<br>
Final Texture rate<br>
8.1<br>
7.2<br>
Observations Detergent Used<br>
1.	the product<br>
2.	Multi Action Surf<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
Final Product    Surf Mutt Action Substance Conclusion<br>
The clothes repeatedly washed hi the final product have a better texture than those washed repeatedly in Multi Action Surf.<br>
This might be the result of the presence of Besan in the final product Present Formulation : An ' eco - friendly' alternative to synthetic detergents [A]    Test of Algal Growth<br>
// is known that synthetic detergents cause Eutrophication in the water bodies. Due to this the algal growth in those water bodies increases rapidly. This causes an imbalance in the ecosystem. To check the growth of algae in water containing the product and to compare with that grown in water containing Multi Action Surf, this test was carried out:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Conclusion:<br>
Since the growth in the tray containing Multi Action Surf is more than the that of the algae grown in the control, we can conclude that it represents the increase in the growth of algae due to Multi Action Surf in the long run which might imbalance the ecosystem.<br>
[A]	However,the Product wont cause this effect as the growth of algae in its tray is the same as<br>
that in the control.<br>
[B]	The raw material needed to prepare the product is completely natural and its mass-production<br>
would not have any hazardous effects on nature.<br>
[C]	All the constituents of the product are natural and thus the product is completely bio<br>
degradable.<br>
