Pyrazoloquinolines with immunomodulating activity<br>
The present invention relates to novel heterocyclic compounds, to methods for their preparation, to compositions containing them, and to  methods and use for clinical treatment of medical conditions which may benefit from immunomcdulation, including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, asthma, transplantation, systemic lupus erythematosis and psoriasis. More particularly the present invention relates to novel heterocyclic compounds, which are CD80 antagonists capable of inhibiting the interactions between CD80. and CD28<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The immune system possesses the ability to control the homeostasis between the activation and inactivation of lymphocytes through various regulatory mechanisms during and after an immune response. Among these are mechanisms that specifically inhibit and/or turn off an immune response. Thus, when an antigen is presented by MKC molecules to the T-cell receotor, the T-cells become orooeriv activated only in the presence of additional co-stimulatory signals. In the absence of accessory signals there is no lymphocyte activation and either a state of functional inactivation termed anergy or tolerance is induced, or the T-cell is specifically deleted by apoptosis. One such co-stimulatory signal involves interaction of CD80 on specialised antigen-presenting cells with CD28 on T-cells, which has been demonstrated to be essential for full T-cell activation. (Lenschow et al. (1936) Annu. Rev. Immunol., 14, 233-233)<br>
  A paper ,by Erbe et alf   in J. Biol. Chem. Vol. 277, No. 9, pp 7363-7368 (2002), describes three small molecule ligands which bind to CD80, and inhibit binding of CD80 to CD28 and CTLA4. Two of the disclosed ligands are fused pyrazolones of structures A and B:<br><br><br><br>
Alk is an ootionally substituted divalent straicht chain or branched C1-C12 alkyler.e, C-C12 alkenyiene cr c-C12 alkynylene radical which may be interrupted by one cr more non-adjacent -0-, -3- cr -N(Ra)- radicals wherein ?.3 represents K or Ci-C±  alkyl, C3-C4 alkenyl, C3-C4 alkyr.yl, or C3-C6 cycioalkyl, and<br>
Q represents H; -CF3; -OH; -SK; -NR8Ra wherein each R3 may be the same or different; an ester group; or an optionally substituted phenyl, C3-C7 cycloalkyl, Cs-C7 cycloalkenyl or heterocyclic ring having from 5 to 3 ring atoms; and<br>
R7 represents H or C1-C5 alkyl; or when taken together with the atom or atoms to which they are attached Rs and R7 form an optionally substituted heterocyclic ring having from 5 to 8 ring atoms.<br>
Compounds of general formula (I) are CD80 antagonists. They inhibit the interaction between CD80 and CD2 8 and thus the activation of T cells, thereby modulating the immune response.<br>
Accordingly the invention also includes; (i) a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutical!*/ or veterinarily acceptable salt thereof for use in the treatment of conditions which benefit from immunomodula-tion.<br>
(ii) the use of a compound of formula (I) or a phar-maceutically or veterinarily acceptable salt thereof in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of conditions which benefit from immunomodulation, .<br>
(iii) a method of immunomodulation in humans and non-human orimates, comorisina administration to a subject in need of such treatment an immunomodulatory effective dose of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable salt thereof (iv) a pharmaceutical or veterinary composition comprising a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable salt thereof together with a<br><br>
pharmaceutically or veterir.arily acceptable excipient or carrier.<br>

Assay Section<br>
The examples described above were tested in a ceil free Homogenous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTR?) assay to determine their activity as inhibitors of the CD80-CD28 interaction.<br>
In the assay, europium and allophycocyanin (APC) are associated with CD28 and CD80 indirectly (through antibody linkers) to form a complex, which brings the europium and APC into close proximity to generate a signal. The complex comprises the following six proteins: fluorescent label 1, linker antibody 1, CD28 fusion protein, CD80 fusion protein, linker antibody 2, and fluorescent label 2, The table below describes these reagents in greater detail.<br><br><br><br>
On formation of the complex, europium and APC are brought into proximity and a signal is generated.<br>
Non-specific interaction was measured by substituting a mouse Fab fragment (C215) for the CD80 mouse Fab fragment fusion protein (1.9ptg/ml)- The assay was carried out in black 384 well plates in a final volume of 30/xl. Assay buffer: 50mM Tris-HCl, 150mM NaCl pH7.8, containing 0.1% BSA (w/V) added just prior to use.<br>
Compounds were added to the above reagents in a concentration series ranging between lOO^M - 1.7nM. The. reaction was incubated for 4 hours at room temperature. Dual measurements were made using a Wallac Victor 142 0 Multilabel Counter/"First measurement: excitation 340nm, emission 665nm, delay 50/is, window time 200/xs. second measurement: excitation 340nm/ emission 615nm, delay 50^s, window time 200/zs.
