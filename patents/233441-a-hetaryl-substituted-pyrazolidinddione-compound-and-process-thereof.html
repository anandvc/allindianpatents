				<td>The present invention relates to a hetarylsubstituted pyrazolidindione compound and process thereof.<br>
The present invention relates to novel hetaryl-substituted pyrazolidinedione derivatives, to a plurality of processes for their preparation and to their use as pesticides and/or herbicides. Moreover, the invention relates to novel selective herbicidal active compound combinations comprising both the hetaryl-substituted pyrazolidinedione derivatives and at least one crop plant compatibility-improving compound, which combinations can be used with particularly good results for the selective control of weeds in various crops of useful plants.<br>
It is known that certain substituted 4-arylpyrazolidine-3,4-diones have acaricidal. insecticidal and herbicidal properties (cf., for example, WO 92/16510, EP-A 508126, WO 96/11574, WO 96/21652, WO 99/47525, WO 01/17351, WO 01/17352, WO 01/17353, WO 01/17972, WO 01/17973, WO 03/028466).<br>
This invention now provides novel compounds of the formula (I)<br>
(Formula Removed) in which<br>
Het       represents in each case optionally substituted thiazolyl (A), oxazqlyl (B) or pyrazolyl (C),<br>
A	represents   hydrogen,   in   each  case   optionally   halogen-substituted   alkyl.   alkenyl   or<br>
alkoxyalkyl,<br>
D represents hydrogen or an optionally substituted radical from the group consisting of alkyl,<br>
alkenyl, alkynyl, alkoxyalkyl, polyalkoxyalkyl, alkylthioalkyl, saturated or unsaturated<br>
cycloalkyl in which optionally one or more ring members are replaced by heteroatoms,<br>
arylalkyl, aryl, hetarylalkyl or hetaryl, or		<br>
A and D together with the atoms to which they are attached represent a saturated or unsaturated cycle which is unsubstituted or substituted in the A, D moiety and optionally contains at least one heteroatom<br>
G	represents hydrogen (a) or represents one of the groups<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
in which<br>
E represents a metal ion equivalent or an ammonium ion,<br>
L represents oxygen or sulfur, .<br>
M represents oxygen or sulfur,<br>
R! represents in each case optionally cyano- or halogen-substituted alkyl, alkenyl,<br>
alkoxyalkyl, alkylthioalkyl, polyalkoxyalkyl or optionally halogen-, alkyl- or<br>
alkoxy-substituted cycloalkyl which may be interrupted by at least one heteroatom,<br>
represents in each case optionally substituted phenyl., phenylalkyl, hetaryl,<br>
phenoxyalkyl or hetaryloxyalkyl,<br>
R-^ represents in each case optionally halogen-substituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxyalkyl,<br>

R-^ represents alkyl, haloalkyl or represents in each case optionally substituted phenyl<br>
or benzyl,<br>
R^ and R^ independently of one another represent in each case optionally halogen-substituted<br>
alkyl, alkoxy, alkylamino, dialkylamino, alkylthip, alkenylthio,<br>
cycloalkylthio and represent in each case optionally substituted phenyl, benzyl,<br>

R^ and R7 independently of one another represent hydrogen, in each case optionally<br>
halogen-substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, alkoxy, alkoxyalkyl, represent<br>
optionally substituted phenyl, represent optionally substituted benzyl, or together<br>
with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached represent a cycle which is<br>
optionally interrupted by oxygen or sulfur.<br>
Depending entirely on the nature of the substituents, the compounds of the formula (I) can be<br>
present as regioisomers, as geometrical and/or optical isomers or as isomer mixtures of varying<br>
composition which, if appropriate, can be separated in a customary manner. The present invention<br>
provides both the pure isomers and the isomer mixtures, their preparation and use and<br>
compositions comprising them. However, hereinbelow, for the sake of simplicity, only compounds<br>
of the formula (I) are referred to, although what is meant are both the pure compounds and, if<br>
appropriate, also mixtures having varying proportions of isomeric compounds.<br>

(safeners/antidotes) described hereinbelow, are extremely effective in preventing damage of the crop<br>
plants and can be used especially advantageously as combination products with a broad range of<br>
activity for the selective control of unwanted plants in crops of useful plants, such as, for example, in<br>
cereals, but also in corn, soybeans and rice.<br>

Active compounds of the formula<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the active compound combinations defined above of<br>
hetaryl-substituted pyrazolidinedione derivatives of the general formula (I) and safeners<br>
(antidotes) from the group (b') listed above, while having very good compatibility with<br>
useful plants, have a particularly high herbicidal activity and can be used in various crops,<br>
in particular in cereals (especially wheat), but also in soybeans, potatoes, com and rice, for<br>
the selective control of weeds.<br>
Here, it has to be considered surprising that, from a large number of known safeners or<br>
antidotes capable of antagonizing the damaging effect of a herbicide on the crop plants, it is<br>
in particular the compounds of group (b') listed above which are suitable for compensating<br>
the damaging effect of hetaryl-substituted pyrazolidinedione derivatives on the crop plants<br>
almost completely, without negatively affecting the herbicidal activity against the weeds to<br>
any considerable extent.<br>
Emphasis may be given here to the particularly advantageous effect of the particularly<br>
preferred and most preferred combination partners made from group (b'), in particular with<br>
respect to sparing cereal plants, such as, for example, wheat, barley and rye, but also corn<br>
and rice, as crop plants.<br>

The halocarbonyl ketenes of the formula (III) required as starting materials in the above processes<br>
(A-a) are novel. They can be prepared in a simple manner by methods know in principle (cf., for<br>
example, Org. Prep. Proced. Int., 7, (4), 155-158, 1975, WO 96/35664, WO 97/02243, WO<br>
97/36868 and DE 1 945 703). Thus, for example, the compounds of the formula (III)<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
in which<br>
Het is as defined above and<br>
Hal represents chlorine or bromine,<br>
are obtained when<br>
substituted phenylmalonic acids of the formula (IV-a)<br>

in which<br>
Het is as defined above<br>
are reacted with acid halides, such as, for example, thionyl chloride, phosphorus(V) chloride,<br>
phosphorus(III) chloride, oxalyl chloride, phosgene or thionyl bromide, if appropriate in the<br>
presence of catalysts, such as, for example, diethylformamide, methylsterylformamide or<br>
triphenylphosphine, and, if appropriate, in the presence of bases, such as, for example, pyridine or<br>
triethylamine.<br>
The substituted phenylmalonic acids of the formula (IV-a) are novel. They can be prepared in a<br>
simple manner by known processes (cf., for example, Organikum, VEB Deutscher Verlag der<br>
Wissenschaften, Berlin 1977, p. 517 ff, EP-A-528 156, WO 96/35664, WO 97/02 243, WO<br>
97/01535, WO 97/36868 and WO 98/05638).<br>

The malonic esters of the formula (IV) where U = OR8<br>

Het and R8 are as defined above<br>
are novel, except for diethyl (l,3,5-trimethyl-lH-pyrazolyl)malonate and diethyl [l-(2,4-<br>

chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane<br>
or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols such as butanol or<br>
glycol and also their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isoburyl<br>
ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide,<br>
and also water.<br>
As solid carriers there are suitable:<br>
for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz,<br>
attapulgite, montmoriHonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals, such as highly<br>
disperse silica, alumina and silicates; as solid carriers for granules there are suitable: for example<br>
crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, and<br>
also synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as<br>
sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; as emulsifiers and/or foam-formers there are<br>
suitable: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters,<br>
polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulfonates, alkyl<br>
sulfates, arylsulfonates and also protein hydrolysates; as dispersants there are suitable: for example •<br>
lignosulfite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of<br>
powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, as well as<br>
natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins, and synthetic phospholipids, can be used in the<br>
formulations. Other additives can be mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and<br>
Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestufis and metal<br>
phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt,<br>
molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The formulations generally comprise between 0.1 and 95% by weight of active compound, preferably<br>
between 0.5 and 90%.<br>

The active compound according to the invention can also be used as such or in its formulations as a<br>
mixture with known fungicides, bactericides. acaricides, nematicides or insecticides in order to<br>
broaden the spectrum of activity for example or prevent the development of resistance. Thus, in many<br>
cases, synergistic effects are obtained, i.e. the effectiveness of the mixture is greater than the<br>
effectiveness of the individual components.<br>

185984-60-5) (cf. WO-96/37494, WO-98/25923),<br>
and preparations which comprise insecticidally active plant extracts, nematodes, fungi or viruses.<br>
A mixture with other known active compounds, such as herbicides, fertilizers, growth regulators,<br>
safeners and/or semiochemicals is also possible.<br>
When used as insecticides, the active compounds according to the invention can furthermore be<br>
present in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms, prepared from these<br>
formulations, as a mixture with synergistic agents. Synergistic agents are compounds, which<br>
increase the action of the active compounds, without it being necessary for the synergistic agent<br>
added to be active itself.<br>
When used as insecticides, the active compounds according to the invention can furthermore be<br>
present in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms, prepared from these<br>
formulations, as a mixture with inhibitors which reduce degradation of the active compound after<br>
use in the vicinity of the plant, on the surface of parts of plants or in plant tissues. -<br>
The active compound content of the use forms prepared from the commercially available<br>
formulations can vary within wide limits. The active compound concentration of the use forms can<br>
be from 0.0000001 to 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.0001 and 1% by<br>
weight.<br>
The compounds are employed in a customary manner appropriate for the use forms.<br>
When used against hygiene pests and pests of stored products, the active compound is<br>
distinguished by an excellent residual action on wood and clay as well as a good stability to alkali<br>
on limed substrates. . -<br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according to the<br>
invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or those obtained by<br>
conventional biological breeding methods, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, and parts thereof,<br>
are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by<br>
genetic engineering, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (Genetic Modified<br>
Organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has<br>
been explained above.<br>
Particularly preferably, plants of the plant cultivars which are in each case commercially available<br>
or in use are treated according to the invention. Plant cultivars are to be understood as meaning<br>
plants having certain properties ("traits") which have been obtained by conventional breeding, by<br>
mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. These can be cultivars, bio- or genotypes.<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils,<br>
climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in<br>
superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a<br>
widening of the activity spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the substances and<br>
compositions to be used according to the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high<br>
or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased<br>
flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better<br>
quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or<br>
processability of the harvested products are possible which exceed the effects which were actually<br>
to be expected.<br>
The transgenic plants or plant cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering) which are<br>
preferably to be treated according to the invention include all plants which, in the genetic<br>
modification, received genetic material which imparted particularly advantageous useful traits to<br>
these plants. Examples of such traits are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low<br>
temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering<br>
performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or<br>
a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of<br>
the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such traits are a better<br>
defense of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites,<br>
phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain<br>
herbicidally active compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the '<br>
important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, tobacco,<br>
oilseed .rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapes), and<br>
particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, tobacco and oilseed rape.<br>
Traits that are emphasized are in particular increased defense of the plants against insects,<br>
arachnids, nematodes and worms by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed in the<br>
plants by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a),<br>
CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryllA, CrylllA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c, Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF and also<br>
combinations thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants"). Traits that are also particularly<br>
emphasized are the increased defense of the plants against fungi, bacteria and viruses by systemic<br>
acquired resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexius, elicitors and resistance genes and<br>
correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins. Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized<br>
are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example<br>
imidazolinones, sulfonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example the "PAT'" gene). The<br>
genes which impart the desired traits in question can also be present in combination with one<br>
another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are maize<br>
varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade<br>
names YIELD GARD® (for example maize, cotton, soya beans), KnockOut® (for example<br>
maize), StarLink® (for example maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLeaf®<br>
(potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton<br>
varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup Ready®<br>
(tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soya bean), Liberty Link® (tolerance to<br>
phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape), IMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS®<br>
(tolerance to sulphonylureas, for example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a<br>
conventional manner for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned include the varieties sold<br>
under the name Clearfield® (for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to plant<br>
cultivars having these genetic traits or genetic traits still to be developed, which plants will be<br>
developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
The plants listed can be treated according to the invention in a particularly advantageous manner<br>
with the compounds of the general formula I and/or the active compound mixtures according to the<br>
invention. The preferred ranges stated above for the active compounds or mixtures also apply to<br>
the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the<br>
compounds or mixtures specifically mentioned in the present text.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention act not only against plant, hygiene and stored<br>
product pests, but also in the veterinary medicine sector against animal parasites (ectoparasites),<br>

spp., Knemidocoptes spp., Cytodites spp. and Laminosioptes spp.<br>
The active compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention are also suitable for<br>
controlling arthropods which infest agricultural productive livestock, such as, for example, cattle,<br>
sheep, goats, horses, pigs, donkeys, camels, buffalo, rabbits, chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese and<br>
bees, other pets, such as, for example, dogs, cats, caged birds and aquarium fish, and also so-called<br>
test animals, such as, for example, hamsters, guinea pigs, rats and mice. By controlling these<br>
arthropods, cases of death and reduction in productivity (for meat, milk, wool, hides, eggs, honey<br>
etc.) should be diminished, so that more economic and easier animal husbandry is possible by use<br>
of the active compounds according to the invention.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention are used in the veterinary sector in a known<br>
manner by enteral administration in the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, potions, drenches,<br>
granules, pastes, boluses, the feed-through process and suppositories, by parenteral administration,<br>
such as, for example, by injection (intramuscular, subcutaneous, intravenous, intraperitoneal and<br>
the like), implants, by nasal administration, by dermal use in the form, for example, of dipping or<br>
bathing, spraying, pouring on and spotting on, washing and powdering, and also with the aid of<br>
molded articles containing the active compound, such as collars, ear marks, tail marks, limb bands,<br>
halters, marking devices and the like.<br>
When used for cattle, poultry, pets and the like, the active compounds of the formula (I) can be<br>
used as formulations (for example powders, emulsions, free-flowing compositions), which<br>
comprise the active compounds in an amount of 1 to 80% by weight, directly or after 100 to 10<br>
000-fold dilution, or they can be used as a chemical bath.<br>
It has furthermore been found that the compounds according to the invention also have a strong<br>
insecticidal action against insects which destroy industrial materials.<br>

Industrial materials in the present connection are to be understood as meaning non-living<br>
materials, such as, preferably, plastics, adhesives, sizes, papers and cards, leather, wood and<br>
processed wood products and coating compositions.<br>
Wood and processed wood products are materials to be protected, especially preferably, from<br>
insect infestation.<br>
Wood and processed wood products which can be protected by the agents according to the<br>
invention or mixtures comprising these are to be understood as meaning, for example:<br>
building timber, wooden beams, railway sleepers, bridge components, boat jetties, wooden<br>
vehicles, boxes, pallets, containers, telegraph poles, wood paneling, wooden windows and doors,<br>

or in building joinery.<br>
4<br>
The active compounds can be used as such, in the form of concentrates or in generally customary<br>
formulations, such as powders, granules, solutions, suspensions, emulsions or pastes.<br>
The formulations mentioned can be prepared in a manner known per se, for example by mixing the<br>
active compounds with at least one solvent or diluent, emulsifier, dispersing agent and/or binder or<br>
fixing agent, a water repellent, if appropriate siccatives and UV stabilizers and if appropriate<br>
dyestuffs and pigments, and also other processing auxiliaries.<br>
The insecticidal compositions or concentrates used for the preservation of wood and wood-derived<br>
timber products comprise the active compound according to the invention in a concentration of<br>
0.0001 to 95% by weight, in particular 0.001 to 60% by weight.<br>
The amount of the compositions or concentrates employed depends on the nature and occurrence<br>
of the insects and on the medium. The optimum amount employed can be determined for the use in<br>
each case by a series of tests. In general, however, it is sufficient to employ 0.0001 to 20% by<br>
weight, preferably 0.001 to 10% by weight, of the active compound, based on the material to be<br>
preserved.<br>
Solvents and/or diluents which are used are an organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or<br>
an oily or oil-like organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture of low volatility and/or a polar<br>
organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or water, and if appropriate an emulsifier and/or<br>
wetting agent.<br>
Organic chemical solvents which are preferably used are oily or oil-like solvents having an<br>
evaporation number above 35 and a flashpoint above 30°C, preferably above 45°C. Substances<br>
which are used as such oily or oil-like water-insoluble solvents of low volatility are appropriate<br>
mineral oils or aromatic fractions thereof, or solvent mixtures containing mineral oils, preferably<br>
white spirit, petroleum and/or alkylbenzene.<br>
Mineral oils having a boiling range from 170 to 220°C, white spirit having a boiling range from<br>
170 to 220°C, spindle oil having a boiling range from 250 to 350°C, petroleum and aromatics<br>
having a boiling range from 160 to 280°C, turpentine oil and the like, are advantageously<br>
employed. .<br>
In a preferred embodiment, liquid aliphatic hydrocarbons having a boiling range from 180 to<br>
210°C or high-boiling mixtures of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons having a boiling range<br>
from 180 to 220°C and/or spindle oil and/or, monochloronaphthalene, preferably o&gt;<br>
monochloronaphthalene, are used.<br>
The organic oily or oil-like solvents of low volatility which have an evaporation number above 35<br>
and a flashpoint above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, can be replaced in part by organic chemical<br>
solvents of high or medium volatility, provided that the solvent mixture likewise has an<br>
evaporation number above 35 and a flashpoint above 30°C. preferably above 45°C, and that the<br>
insecticide/fungicide mixture is soluble or emulsifiable in this solvent mixture.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, some of the organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture is<br>
replaced by an aliphatic polar organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture. Aliphatic organic<br>
chemical solvents containing hydroxyl and/or ester and/or ether groups, such as, for example,<br>
glycol ethers, esters or the like, are preferably used.<br>
Organic chemical binders which are used in the context of the present invention are the synthetic<br>
resins and/or binding drying oils which are known per se, are water-dilutable and/or are soluble or<br>
dispersible or emulsifiable in the organic chemical solvents employed, in particular binders<br>
consisting of or comprising an acrylate resin, a vinyl resin, for example polyvinyl acetate,<br>
polyester resin, polycondensation or polyaddition resin, polyurethane resin, alkyd resin or<br>
modified alkyd resin, phenolic resin, hydrocarbon resin, such as indene-cumarone resin, silicone<br>
resin, drying vegetable oils and/or drying oils and/or physically drying binders based on a natural<br>
and/or synthetic resin.<br>
The synthetic resin used as the binder can be employed in the form of an emulsion, dispersion or<br>
solution. Bitumen or bituminous substances can also be used as binders in an amount of up to 10%<br>
by weight. Dyestuffs, pigments, water-repelling agents, odor correctants and inhibitors or<br>
anticorrosive agents and the like which are known per se can additionally be employed.<br>
It is preferred according to the invention for the composition or concentrate to comprise, as the<br>
organic chemical binder, at le-ist one alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin and/or a drying vegetable<br>
oil. Alkyd resins having an oil content of more than 45% by weight, preferably 50 to 68% by<br>
weight, are preferably used according to the invention.<br>
All or some of the binder mentioned can be replaced by a fixing agent (mixture) .or a plasticizer<br>
(mixture). These additives are intended to prevent evaporation of the active compounds and<br>
crystallization or precipitation. They preferably replace 0.01 to 30% of the binder (based on 100%<br>
of the binder employed).<br>
The plasticizers originate from the chemical classes of phthalic acid esters, such as dibutyl, dioctyl<br>
or benzyl butyl phthalate, phosphoric acid esters, such as tributyl phosphate, adipic acid esters,<br>
such as di-(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, stearates, such as butyl stearate or amyl stearate, oleates, such as<br>
butyl oleate, glycerol ethers or higher molecular weight glycol ethers, glycerol esters and ptoluenesulfonic<br>
acid esters.<br>
Fixing agents are based chemically on polyvinyl alkyl ethers, such as, for example, polyvinyl<br>
methyl ether or ketones, such as benzophenone or ethylenebenzophenone.<br>
Possible solvents or diluents are, in particular, also water, if appropriate as a mixture with one or<br>
more of the abovementioned organic chemical solvents or diluents, emulsifiers and dispersing<br>
agents.<br>
Particularly effective preservation of wood is achieved by impregnation processes on a large<br>
industrial scale, for example vacuum, double vacuum or pressure processes.<br>
The ready-to-use compositions can also comprise other insecticides, if appropriate, and also one or<br>
more fungicides, if appropriate.<br>
Possible additional mixing partners are, preferably, the insecticides and fungicides mentioned in<br>
WO 94/29 268. The compounds mentioned in this document are an explicit constituent of the<br>
present application.<br>

The compounds according to the invention can at the same time be employed for protecting objects<br>
which come into contact with saltwater or brackish water, such as hulls, screens, nets, buildings,<br>
moorings and signalling systems, against fouling.<br>
Fouling by sessile Oligochaeta, such as Serpulidae, and by shells and species from the<br>
Ledamorpha group (goose barnacles), such as various Lepas and Scalpellum species, or by species<br>
from the Balanomorpha group (acorn barnacles), such as Balanus or Pollicipes species, increasesthe frictional drag of ships and, as a consequence, leads to a marked increase in operational costs<br>
owing to higher energy consumption and additionally frequent residence in the dry dock.<br>
Apart from fouling by algae, for example Ectocarpus sp. and Ceramium sp., fouling by sessile<br>
Entomostraka groups, which come under the generic term Cirripedia (cirriped crustaceans), is of<br>
particular importance.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the compounds according to the invention, alone or in<br>
combination with other active compounds, have an outstanding antifouling action.<br>

However, the use of the active compounds according to the invention is in no way<br>
restricted to these genera, but extends in the same manner to other plants.<br>
Depending on the concentration, the active compounds according to the invention are<br>
suitable for the nonselective weed control on, for example, industrial terrains and railway<br>
tracks and on paths and locations with and without trees. Likewise the active compounds<br>
according to the invention can be employed for controlling weeds in perennial crops, for<br>
example forests, ornamental tree plantings, orchards, vineyards, citrus groves, nut orchards,<br>
banana plantations, coffee plantations, tea plantations, rubber plantations, oil palm<br>
• plantations, cocoa plantations, soft fruit plantings and hop fields, on lawns, turf and<br>
pastureland, and for the selective control of weeds in annual crops.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention have strong herbicidal activity<br>
and a broad activity spectrum when used on the soil and on aerial plant'parts. To a certain<br>
extent, they are also suitable for the selective control of monocotyledonous and<br>
dicotyledonous weeds in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous crops, both pre- and postemergence.<br>
At certain concentrations or application rates, the active compounds according to the<br>
invention can also be employed for controlling animal pests and fungal or bacterial plant<br>
diseases. If appropriate, they can also be used as intermediates or precursors for the<br>
synthesis of other active compounds.<br>
The active compounds can be converted into the customary formulations, such as solutions,<br>
emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble powders, granules,<br>
suspoemulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials impregnated with active<br>
compound, and microencapsulations in polymeric materials.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active<br>
compounds with extenders, that is, liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with the<br>
use of surfactants, that is, emulsifiers and/or dispersants and/or foam formers.<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible, for example, to use organic solvents as<br>

ground synthetic minerals such as highly disperse silica, alumina and silicates, suitable solid<br>
carriers for granules are: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite,<br>
marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, or else synthetic granules of inorganic and organic<br>
meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, com cobs and<br>
tobacco stalks; suitable emulsifiers and/or foam-formers are: for example nonionic and<br>
anionic emulsifiers such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol<br>
ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulfonates, alkyl sulfates, arylsulfonates<br>
or else protein hydrolyzates; suitable dispersants are: for example lignosulfite waste liquors<br>
and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of<br>
powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, or<br>
else natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins and synthetic phospholipids, can be<br>
used in the formulations. Other possible additives are mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, -for example iron oxide, titanium<br>
oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic colorants, such as alizarin colorants, azo colorants and<br>
metal phthalocyanine colorants, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron,<br>

be used for weed control purposes as a mixture with known herbicides and/or with<br>
substances which improve crop plant compatibility ("safeners"), ready mixes or tank mixes<br>
being possible. Mixtures with herbicide products which contain one or more known<br>

Example A<br>
Critical concentration test/soil insects - treatment of transgenic plants<br>
Test insect: Diabrotica balteata - larvae in soil<br>
Solvent: 7 parts by weight of acetone<br>
Emulsifier: 1 part by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether<br>
To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is<br>
mixed with the stated amount of solvent, the stated amount of emulsifier is added and the<br>
concentrate is diluted with water to the desired concentration.<br>
The preparation of active compound is poured onto the solvent. Here, the concentration of active<br>
compound in the preparation is virtually immaterial, only the amount of weight of active<br>
compound per volume unit of soil, which is stated in ppm (mg/1), matters. The soil is filled into<br>
0.25 1 pots, and these are allowed to stand at 20°C.<br>
Immediately after the preparation, 5 pregerminated rnaize corns of the cultivar YIELD GUARD<br>
(trade mark of Monsanto Comp., USA) are placed into each pot. After 2 days, the appropriate test_<br>
insects are placed into the treated soil. After a further 7 days, the efficacy of the active compound<br>
is determined by counting the maize plants that have emerged (1 plant = 20% activity).<br>

Example B<br>
Heliothis virescens test - treatment of transgenic plants<br>
Solvent: 7 parts by weight of acetone<br>
Emulsifler: 1 part by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether<br>
To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is<br>
mixed with the stated amount of solvent and the stated amount of emulsifler, and the concentrate is<br>
diluted with water to the desired concentration.<br>
Soybean shoots (Glycine max) of the cultivar Roundup Ready (trade mark of Monsanto Comp.<br>
USA) are treated by being dipped into the preparation of active compound of the desired concentration<br>
and are populated With the tobacco butt worm Heliothis virescens while the leaves are<br>
still moist<br>
After the desired period of time, the kill of the insects is determined.<br>
Example C<br>
1. Herbicidal pre-emergence action<br>
Seeds of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weed and crop plants are placed into sandy loam<br>
and covered with soil. The test compounds, formulated in the form of emulsion concentrates (EC),<br>
are, in various dosages with a water application rate of 800 I/ha (converted), with wetting agent<br>
added, applied to the surface of the covering soil.<br>
After the treatment, the pots are placed in a greenhouse and kept under good growth conditions for<br>
the test plants. The visual assessment of the emergence damage on the test plants is carried out<br>
after a trial period of 2 to 3 weeks by comparison with untreated controls (herbicidal effect in<br>
percent (%): 100% effect = the plants have died, 0% effect = like control plants).<br>
2. Herbicidal post-emergence action<br>
Seeds of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weed and crop plants are placed into sandy loam,<br>
covered with soil and cultivated in a greenhouse under good growth conditions. About 2 weeks<br>
after sowing, the test plants are treated at the one-leaf stage. The test compounds, formulated as<br>
emulsion concentrates (EC), are, in various dosages with a water application rate of 800.1/ha<br>
(converted), with wetting agents added, sprayed onto the green parts of the plants. After, the test<br>
plants have been kept in the greenhouse under optimum growth conditions for 2 weeks, the effect<br>
of the preparations is rated visually in comparison to untreated controls (herbicidal effect in<br>
percent (%): 100% effect = the plants have died, 0% effect = like control plants).<br>
