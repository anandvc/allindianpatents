				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to glazing having two characteristics:<br>
- firstly, glazing called safety glazing, in the sense that it is<br>
capable of retaining fragments (especially glass fragments) in the event<br>
of breakage. This relates especially to glazing assemblies according to<br>
European standard ECE R43 or American standard ANSI Z26.1. Preferably,<br>
such glazing assemblies successfully pass the two tests described in these<br>
standards by the terms "ball drop" and "phantom drop". The most usual<br>
configuration of such glazing assemblies is that of standard laminated<br>
glazing, consisting of two essentially transparent (generally glass) rigid<br>
substrates between which a sheet of thermoplastic polymer is placed,<br>
this sheet ensuring that the glass fragments are retained in the event of<br>
breakage.<br>
As is known, lamination generally requires the three assembled<br>
elements to be heated, generally with pressure, so as to soften the<br>
thermoplastic sheet and to make it adherent, and possibly to remove the<br>
residual air between the various elements of the glazing.<br>
It may also be laminated glazing in which the interlayer sheet is<br>
based on a one-sided or two-sided adhesive polymer of the elastomer<br>
type, which avoids the abovementioned hot-lamination operation.<br>
It also includes safety glazing in which the fragment-retention<br>
function is obtained by a plastic film, especially one consisting of the<br>
superposition of a thermoplastic sheet of the polyvinyl butyral type and<br>
of a sheet of protective polymer, of the polyethylene terephthalate (PET)<br>
type, which is made to adhere to a rigid substrate of the glass type. Such<br>
plastic film is, for example, sold by DuPont de Nemours under the name<br>
"Spalled Shield", or under other brand names by 3M or by Southwall. This<br>
polymer sheet may optionally be transparent to electromagnetic<br>
radiation. The same applies to the product sold by 3M, which is an<br>
assembly consisting of a complex of at least two thermoplastic sheets f 1<br>
and f"1, the nature and the thicknesses of each of these sheets possibly<br>
being different depending on the desired applications; and<br>
- secondly, the glazing according to the invention is<br>
"functionalized" in the sense that it has at least one functionality<br>
conferred on it by one or more thin films and/or one or more<br>
discontinuous elements that may be of organic, inorganic or organic-<br>
inorganic hybrid nature (these films or elements generally being placed<br>
against one of the rigid substrates of the glazing according to the<br>
invention). They will be denoted hereafter by the term "active<br>
system(s)". The glazing according to the invention may have one or more<br>
active systems.<br>
The first types of active system useful for the invention are in<br>
general electrochemical systems, and more particularly electrically<br>
controllable systems of the glazing type having variable energy and/or<br>
optical properties.<br>
The electrically controllable systems make it possible in particular<br>
to obtain glazing of which it is possible to modify, at will, the<br>
darkening/degree of vision or of filtration of thermal/solar radiation. This<br>
is, for example, viologen-based glazing, which allows the transmission or<br>
absorption of light to be controlled, as described in Patent US-5 239 406.<br>
Electroluminescent systems convert electrical energy directly into<br>
light, one example being described in Patent FR- 2 770 222.<br>
The invention also applies to devices using electrochromic systems,<br>
operating in transmission or in reflection.<br>
Examples of electrochromic systems are described in Patents<br>
US-5 239 406 and EP-612 826.<br>
Electrochromic systems have been very widely studied. As is<br>
generally known, they comprise two layers of electrochromic material<br>
separated by an electrolyte and flanked by two electrodes. Each of the<br>
electrochromic layers, under the effect of an electrical supply, can inject<br>
charges reversibly, the modification in their oxidation state as a result of<br>
such injection/ejections resulting in a modification in their optical<br>
and/or thermal properties (for example, in the case of tungsten oxide, a<br>
switch from a blue colour to a colourless appearance).<br>
It is conventional to put electrochromic systems into three<br>
categories:<br>
- that in which the electrolyte is in the form of a polymer or a gel,<br>
for example a proton-conductive polymer, such as those described in<br>
Patents EP-253 713 or EP-670 346, or a lithium-ion-conductive polymer<br>
such as those described in Patents EP-382 623, EP-518 754 and EP-532<br>
408, the other layers of the system generally being inorganic in nature;<br>
- that in which all the layers are essentially inorganic. This<br>
category is often termed an "all-solid-state" system; examples of such<br>
may be found in Patent EP-867 752, EP-831 360, French Patent<br>
Application FR-2 791 147 and French Patent Application FR-2 781 084; and<br>
- that in which all the layers are based on polymers, which<br>
category is often noted by the term "all-polymer" system.<br>
There are also systems called "optical valves": these are polymer-<br>
based films in which microdroplets are arranged, these microdroplets<br>
containing particles capable of adopting a preferred orientation under<br>
the action of an electric field. An example of this is described in Patent<br>
WO 93/09460.<br>
There are also liquid-crystal systems, with a mode of operation<br>
similar to the above systems: they use, placed between two conductive<br>
layers, a polymer film in which liquid-crystal droplets are dispersed,<br>
especially nematic liquid crystals with a positive dielectric anisotropy.<br>
When the film is under tension, the liquid crystals are oriented along a<br>
preferred axis, which allows vision. With no voltage, the film becomes<br>
diffusing. Examples of these are described in Patents EP-88 126, EP-268<br>
877, EP-238 164, EP-357 234, EP-409 442 and EP-964 288. Mention may<br>
also be made of cholesteric liquid-crystal polymers, such as those<br>
described in Patent WO 92/19695, and liquid-crystal systems that switch<br>
with a variation in light transmission TL.<br>
A second type of active system to which the invention applies<br>
relates to layers or multilayers, the properties of which change without<br>
an electrical supply, under the effect of heat or light: mention may be<br>
made of thermochromic layers, especially those based on vanadium oxide<br>
(an example of which is given in French Patent FR 2 809 388),<br>
thermotropic layers and photochromic layers.<br>
Also possibly involved are photovoltaic systems that convert light<br>
energy into electrical energy.<br>
Within the context of the present invention and throughout the<br>
text, the term "layer" must be understood in its broadest sense: it may<br>
equally well be made of mineral materials and organic-type materials,<br>
most particularly polymers, which may be in the form of polymer films or<br>
even gel films. This is especially the case with thermotropic gels, for<br>
example, those described in Patents EP-639 450, US 5 615 040, WO<br>
94/20294 and EP-878 296.<br>
Another type of active system to which the invention applies<br>
relates to layers or multilayers having solar-control or low-emissivity<br>
properties, especially those based on one or more metal layers, or on<br>
metal oxide layers sandwiched by dielectric layers. These multilayers<br>
may be deposited on one of the rigid substrates or may be deposited on a<br>
flexible substrate of the PET (polyethylene terephthalate) type, which is<br>
placed between two sheets of thermoplastic polymer of the PVB<br>
(polyvinyl butyral) type, which joins the two rigid glass-type substrates<br>
together. Examples of these may be found in Patents EP-638 528, EP-718<br>
250, EP-724 955 , EP-758 583 and EP- 847 965.<br>
Finally, mention may also be made of coatings with an acoustic<br>
function (acoustic attenuation) or an optical (decorative, absorbent, etc.)<br>
function.<br>
It is not simple to devise glazing assemblies having the above two<br>
characteristics, since the combination of an active system and polymer<br>
sheets having a fragment-retaining function in glazing creates additional<br>
constraints. Thus, if an active system, for example an electrochromic<br>
system, is interposed in a conventional laminated glazing assembly<br>
between the glass and the inserted polymer film, there is a tendency for<br>
the adhesion of the polymer film to the glass to decrease. There is<br>
therefore an increased risk that, should the glazing break, the glass<br>
fragments can no longer be predominantly retained by the polymer film,<br>
as the standards so require.<br>
If, to avoid this, the active system is placed on one of the outer<br>
faces of a standard laminated glazing assembly (on face 1 or face 4, using<br>
the conventional numbering system, the rules of which are recalled<br>
below: the substrate in contact with the outside is called first substrate<br>
S1 and the substrate in contact with the inside is called second substrate<br>
S2; for a laminated substrate: face 1 = that face of the first substrate<br>
which faces towards the outside; face 2 = that face of the first substrate<br>
which is directed towards the inside; face 3 = that face of the second<br>
substrate which is directed towards the outside and faces the face 2; face<br>
4 = that face of the second substrate which is directed towards the<br>
inside), means must therefore be provided in order to protect it from any<br>
contact with the ambient atmosphere and to protect it from chemical or<br>
mechanical degradation. This therefore requires the use of an additional<br>
protective substrate (i.e. a three-glass system). However, a number of<br>
applications require the glazing to have a nominal thickness, and it is not<br>
always possible to offer (excessively) thick glazing. This is especially the<br>
case for sunroofs of motor vehicles, in which the bodymakers generally<br>
install laminated or toughened glass panes, the overall thickness of which<br>
may not exceed about 5 mm. This is also the case for roof windows for<br>
example, in which the window frame allows the fitting only of windows<br>
having a predefined thickness, and one that is often imposed by the<br>
thermal insulation performance to be achieved.<br>
To obviate this protection problem, the active system is generally<br>
inserted between the two substrates. This incorporation between the two<br>
substrates generates other problems that the incorporators seek to<br>
minimize, or even eliminate.<br>
In general, the active system is incorporated on face 3 of the<br>
substrate assembly before the lamination operation and after the bending<br>
and/or toughening operation (when, of course, the substrates have to<br>
undergo a bending and/or toughening operation).<br>
However, the incorporation of an active system on face 3 of a<br>
laminated substrate, the substrates of which have individually undergone<br>
a bending operation, generates other drawbacks that the present<br>
invention aims to remedy.<br>
This is because incorporation of the active system on face 3 of the<br>
assembly is in fact carried out on that face of the second substrate which<br>
has been in contact with the members that have caused the bending. As a<br>
consequence of this contact between the members needed for the<br>
bending operation and that face of the substrate in question, surface<br>
defects are inevitably created on the face of the substrate in question.<br>
These surface defects may result in delamination problems at the<br>
interface between the active system and face 3 of the substrate, this<br>
delamination possibly resulting in irreversible deterioration of the<br>
complete glazing assembly.<br>
The present invention therefore aims to alleviate these drawbacks<br>
by proposing a glazing assembly containing an active system of simplified<br>
structure.<br>
The subject of the invention is therefore a glazing assembly<br>
comprising, in succession:<br>
a first rigid substrate; a second rigid substrate; at least one active system<br>
comprising at least one layer and placed between the first and second<br>
substrates; and at least one polymer film having the function of retaining<br>
the fragments of the glazing assembly in the event of it breaking, the said<br>
film being placed between the first substrate and the second substrate,<br>
which glazing assembly is characterized in that the active system is on<br>
the inner face of the first substrate.<br>
Thanks to the positioning of the active system on face 2 of the first<br>
substrate, it is possible to produce safety glazing assemblies.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention, one or more of the<br>
following arrangements may optionally also be employed:<br>
- the active system is an electrically controllable system having<br>
variable optical and/or energy properties, of the electrochromic system,<br>
optical valve, viologen-based system, liquid-crystal system or<br>
electroluminescent system type;<br>
- the first and second substrates are made of glass;<br>
- it includes at least one sheet of thermoplastic polymer (f1),<br>
with the function of retaining fragments of the glazing assembly should it<br>
break, between the two substrates;<br>
- the total thickness (e1+2) of the two substrates and of all the<br>
materials that can be placed between them is less than or equal to 8 mm,<br>
especially less than or equal to 5.5 mm, preferably between 2 mm and 5<br>
mm;<br>
- the total thickness (e1+2) of the two substrates and of all the<br>
materials that can be placed between them is less than or equal to 30<br>
mm, preferably between 6 mm and 25 mm;<br>
- the two substrates have substantially identical shapes and<br>
substantially identical dimensions;<br>
- the two substrates have different dimensions and substantially<br>
identical shapes;<br>
- it is provided with an opacifying peripheral coating, of the<br>
screen-printed type, especially around the periphery of the inner face of<br>
the first substrate and/or the periphery of the outer or inner face of the<br>
second substrate;<br>
- it is provided with at least a first peripheral seal in contact with<br>
the facing faces of the substrates;<br>
- it is provided with at least a second peripheral seal in contact<br>
with the edges of the substrates;<br>
- the first and/or second peripheral seal(s) is (are) attached or<br>
obtained by extrusion or obtained by encapsulation;<br>
- the second peripheral seal, or at least one of them if there are<br>
more than one, is flush with the outer face of the first substrate;<br>
- the first and/or second peripheral seal, or at least one of them<br>
if there are more than two seals, at least partly fills an open peripheral<br>
groove defined by a recess between the two substrates; and<br>
- the first and/or second peripheral seal is penetrated by<br>
connection elements of the active system and/or at least partly contains<br>
mechanical reinforcement elements.<br>
The subject of the invention is also, more particularly, the<br>
embodiment in which the glazing assembly is a laminated glazing<br>
assembly, with at least two glass substrates S1, S2 joined together by<br>
lamination, which is provided with an active system preferably placed on<br>
face 2 (of the substrate S1). It is therefore the thermoplastic sheet<br>
between the substrates S1 and S2 that mainly provides the safety<br>
function (retention of fragments in the event of breakage).<br>
The subject of the invention is any of the applications of the<br>
glazing assemblies described above, especially in buildings, as a roof<br>
window or curtain wall, and for the motor vehicle industry, as a sunroof<br>
(which may or may not open), side windows, rear windows, or part of a<br>
windscreen.<br>
The subject of the invention is also a motor vehicle thus equipped,<br>
preferably with the glazing assembly or assemblies according to the<br>
invention flush with the body.<br>
The invention will now be described in detail with the aid of non-<br>
limiting examples illustrated by the following figures:<br>
- Figure 1 is a front view of face 2, forming the subject of the<br>
invention;<br>
- Figure 2 is a sectional view on AA of Figure 1;<br>
- Figure 3 is a sectional view on BB of Figure 1;<br>
- Figure 4 is a front view of face 2 forming the subject of the<br>
invention, in the case of another embodiment, and revealing the laser<br>
ablation lines;<br>
- Figure 5 is a sectional view on DD of Figure 4; and<br>
- Figure 6 is a sectional view on EE of Figure 4.<br>
In the appended drawings, certain elements may be represented<br>
on a larger or smaller scale than in reality, so as to make it easier to<br>
understand the figure.<br>
The example illustrated by Figures 2 and 3 relates to a motor-<br>
vehicle sunroof 1. It comprises in succession, from the outside towards<br>
the interior of the passenger compartment, two glass panes S1, S2, which<br>
are made of silica-soda-lime clear glass (but they may also be tinted),<br>
respectively 2.1 mm and 2.1 mm in thickness for example.<br>
The glass panes S1 and S2 are of the same size and of rectangular<br>
overall shape. Their dimensions are 900 x 500 mm2. The glass pane S1 is<br>
also partly covered around the periphery with an enamel 7, deposited by<br>
a known screen-printing technique.<br>
The glass pane S1 shown in Figures 2 and 3 includes, on face 2, a<br><br>
thin-film multilayer of the all-solid-state electrochromic type.<br>
The glass pane S1 is laminated to the glass pane S2 via a<br>
thermoplastic sheet f1 made of polyurethane (PU) 0.8 mm in thickness (it<br>
may be replaced with a sheet of ethylene/vinyl acetate (EVA) or polyvinyl<br>
butyral (PVB)).<br>
The all-solid-state electrochromic thin-film multilayer includes an<br>
active multilayer 3 placed between two current collectors 2 and 4. The<br>
collector 2 is intended to be in contact with the face 2. A first array of<br>
conducting wires 5 (visible in Figure 1) or an equivalent device allows<br>
electric current to be brought to the collector 4; a second array of<br>
conducting wires 6 (also visible in Figure 1) or an equivalent device allows<br>
electric current to be brought to the lower collector 2.<br>
The collectors 2 and 4 and the active multilayer 3 may be either<br>
substantially of identical size and shape, or substantially of different size<br>
and shape, and therefore the paths of the collectors 2 and 4 will be<br>
adapted according to the configuration. Moreover, the dimensions of the<br>
substrates, particularly S1, may essentially be greater than those of 2, 4<br>
and 3.<br>
The collectors 2 and 4 are of the metal type or of the TCO<br>
(transparent conductive oxide) type made of ITO, F:SnO2 or Al:ZnO, or<br>
may be a multilayer of the TCO/metal/TCO type. Depending on the<br>
configuration, they may be omitted, and in this case the current leads 5<br>
and 6 are in direct contact with the active multilayer 3.<br>
A preferred way of producing the collector 2 consists in depositing,<br>
on face 2, a 50 nm SiOC first layer surmounted by a 400 nm F: SnO2<br>
second layer (the two layers preferably being deposited in succession by<br>
CVD on float glass before cutting).<br>
A second way of producing the collector 2 consists in depositing,<br>
on face 2, a bilayer consisting of an optionally doped SiO2-based first<br>
layer (the doping especially being with aluminium or boron)<br>
approximately 20 nm in thickness surmounted by an ITO second layer<br>
approximately 100 to 600 nm in thickness (the two layers preferably<br>
being vacuum-deposited in succession, by magnetically enhanced reactive<br>
sputtering in the presence of oxygen, optionally carried out hot).<br><br>
Another way of producing the collector 2 consists in depositing, on<br>
face 2, a monolayer made of ITO approximately 100 to 600 nm in<br>
thickness (a layer preferably vacuum-deposited by magnetically enhanced<br>
reactive sputtering in the presence of oxygen and optionally carried out<br>
hot).<br>
The collector 4 is an ITO layer 100 to 500 nm in thickness, also<br>
deposited by magnetically enhanced reactive sputtering on the active<br>
multilayer.<br>
In Figure 1, the current leads 5 are metal wires associated with<br>
metal shims. The metal wires are, for example, made of tungsten (or else<br>
copper or molybdenum), these being optionally coated with carbon and<br>
partly oxidized, with a diameter of between 10 and 100 urn and<br>
preferably between 20 and 50 µm, the said wires being straight or<br>
corrugated, and deposited on a sheet of PU by a technique known in the<br>
field of wire-heated windscreens, for example that described in Patents<br>
EP-785 700, EP-553 025, EP-506 521 and EP-496 669.<br>
One of these known techniques consists in using a heated press<br>
roll, which presses the wire onto the surface of the polymer sheet, this<br>
press roll being supplied with wire from a feed reel using a wire guide<br>
device. The metal shims consist, in a known manner, of copper strips<br>
optionally covered with a tin alloy, with a total thickness typically of 50<br>
urn and a width of between 3 and 8 mm.<br>
The current leads in another embodiment are obtained by a<br>
screen-printing technique, these being deposited directly on the<br>
enamelled regions of face 2. This screen-printed coating, especially based<br>
on silver, may also be deposited on the ITO layer. A conductive paste may<br>
also serve for supplying current and, in this case, it is in contact with the<br>
ITO layer or with the enamel layer present on face 2.<br>
The active multilayer 3 shown in Figures 2 and 3 is made up as<br>
follows:<br>
- a layer of anodic electrochromic material made of hydrated<br>
iridium oxide 40 to 100 nm in thickness (it may be replaced with a layer<br>
of hydrated nickel oxide 40 to 300 nm in thickness), possibly alloyed with<br>
other metals;<br><br>
- a layer of tungsten oxide 100 nm in thickness;<br>
- a layer of hydrated tantalum oxide or of hydrated silica oxide or<br>
hydrated zirconium oxide 100 nm in thickness; and<br>
- a layer of cathodic electrochromic material based on hydrated<br>
tungsten oxide 370 nm in thickness.<br>
Moreover, the glazing assembly shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3<br>
incorporates, (but not shown in the figures) a first peripheral seal in<br>
contact with faces 2 and 3, this first seal being suitable for forming a<br>
barrier to external chemical attack.<br>
A second peripheral seal is in contact with the edge of S1, the edge<br>
of S2 and face 4, so as to form a barrier, provide a means of mounting the<br>
assembly in the vehicle and sealing between the inside and the outside,<br>
providing an aesthetic function and a means of incorporating<br>
reinforcement elements.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention shown in<br>
Figures 4, 5 and 6, which differs from the embodiment shown in Figures<br>
1, 2 and 3 by the fact that the ITO layer 2 covers the entire surface of<br>
face 2 (visible in Figure 4).<br>
To avoid short circuits between the various elements of the<br>
system, it is necessary to carry out a surface ablation operation on<br>
certain regions of the assembly, this ablation being carried out for<br>
example by a laser margining technique.<br>
In particular, Figures 4, 5 and 6 show, by the reference numeral 8,<br>
laser ablation of just the ITO layer 2, so as to form an ITO peripheral<br>
region that is electrically isolated from the central region.<br>
Moreover, Figures 4 and 5 show, by the reference numeral 9, laser<br>
ablation of the ITO layer 2, of the active multilayer 3 and the collector 4,<br>
so as to allow electrical supply without short-circuiting each of the<br>
collectors.<br>
Finally, Figures 4 and 6 show, by the reference numeral 10, laser<br>
ablation of the active multilayer 3 and of the collector 4, so as to provide<br>
electrical isolation between the two current collectors.<br>
The glazing assembly 1 incorporates electrical connectors that<br>
allow the active system to be controlled via a power supply. These<br><br>
electrical connectors are of the type used for heated windows.<br>
According to other variants, the "all-solid-state" active multilayer<br>
3 may be replaced with other families of polymer-type electrochromic<br>
systems.<br>
Thus, for example, a first part, formed from a layer of<br>
electrochromic material, otherwise called active layer, made of poly(3,4-<br>
ethylenedioxythiophene) from 10 to 10000 nm, preferably 50 to 500 nm,<br>
in thickness - as a variant it may be one of the derivatives of this polymer<br>
- is deposited by known liquid deposition techniques (spray coating, dip<br>
coating, spin coating or casting), or else by electrodeposition, on a<br>
substrate coated with its lower or upper conducting layer forming the<br>
electrode (anode or cathode), or more generally the current lead.<br>
Whatever the polymer of which this active layer is made, this polymer is<br>
particularly stable, especially to UV, and operates by the<br>
injection/ejection of lithium ions (Li+) or else H+ ions.<br>
A second part, acting as electrolyte and formed from a layer with a<br>
thickness of between 50 nm and 2000 µm, and preferably between 50 nm<br>
and 1000 um, is deposited by a known liquid deposition technique (spray<br>
coating, dip coating, spin coating or casting), between the first and third<br>
parts, on the first part, or by injection moulding. This second part is<br>
based on a polyalkylene oxide, especially polyethylene oxide. As a<br>
variant, it may be an inorganic-type electrolyte based for example on<br>
hydrated tantalum oxide, zirconium oxide or silicon oxide.<br>
This second electrolyte part deposited on the layer of active<br>
electrochromic material, which is itself supported by the glass or similar<br>
substrate, is then coated with a third part, the composition of which is<br>
similar to the first part, namely this third part is made of a substrate,<br>
coated with a current lead (conducting wires, conducting wires plus<br>
conducting layer, or just a conducting layer), this current lead itself<br>
being covered with an active layer.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the resulting electrochromic active<br>
multilayer is based on a self-supporting polymer film. This self-supporting<br>
film is defined as follows: it is a polymer film that incorporates both the<br><br>
two layers of electrochromic material and the electrolyte, and exhibits<br>
its intrinsic mechanical properties (strength, rigidity, etc.).<br>
In a first variant of this self-supporting film, it is based on a more<br>
complex system, called an interpenetrating network of molecules of 3,4-<br>
ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDT) or of its derivatives, and of a polyalkylene<br>
oxide.<br>
One definition of an interpenetrating network (or IPN) is as<br>
follows: a matrix of at least two polymers crosslinked in each other. This<br>
is a polymer alloy that combines the properties of the polymers that<br>
make up the interpenetrating network. They are materials in which the<br>
sizes of the domains delimited by the entanglement of the crosslinked<br>
polymers is generally of the order of a few tens of nanometres.<br>
In a second variation of this self-supporting film, it is based on a<br>
simple system, called a semi-interpenetrating network (semi-IPN), in<br>
which the 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene molecules are polymerized in a<br>
polyalkylene oxide network (the electrolyte). The polyalkylene oxide<br>
network results, for example, from the radical copolymerization of a<br>
monofunctional polyethylene oxide (PEO) and of a bifunctional<br>
polyethylene oxide (PEO) in variable proportions and of variable length.<br>
Ttje term "semi-interpenetrating network" refers to any matrix consisting<br>
of at least one polymer network and at least one second polymer<br>
entangled in the first network but not forming a second network.<br>
Whatever the variant of this self-supporting film and depending on<br>
its conditions of formation, it is possible to obtain a plurality of film<br>
configurations ranging from a system comprising three well-defined layers<br>
(excluding the electrically conducting layers forming the electrodes)<br>
(namely two electrochromic layers separated by an electrolyte layer) that<br>
is similar in its construction to that obtained in the first embodiment<br>
containing a system whose interfaces are relatively diffused, or indeed<br>
more than a single layer exhibiting composition gradients. Nevertheless,<br>
the electronic conductivity of at least one of the active layers is<br>
sufficient to replace the conducting layers with an array of wires.<br>
Thus, IPNs and semi-IPNs are produced, the compositions of which<br>
are for example the following:<br>
The PEO/PC ratio is expressed as a percentage of the initial<br>
monomer. The percentage of PEDT is expressed relative to the<br>
percentage of PEO monomer. The composition of the PEO/PC network is<br>
in accordance with that of the initial monomer mixture. In contrast, the<br>
percentage of PEDT in the final network depends on the EDT monomer<br>
polymerization time. The thickness of the IPN or semi-IPN thus obtained<br>
is between 50 and 2000 µm and preferably between 250 and 500 urn.<br>
In another embodiment of the active system, the multilayer 3<br>
comprises an active system of the electroluminescent type.<br>
A first family may be distinguished in which the organic<br>
electroluminescent material of the thin layer is made from evaporated<br>
molecules (OLEDs) such as for example the AIQ3 complex (tris(8-<br>
hydroxyquinoline) aluminium), DPVBi (4,4'-(diphenylvinylenebiphenyl)),<br>
DMQA (dimethyl quinacridone) or DCM (4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-<br>
(4-dimethylaminostyryl)-4H-pyran). In this case, additional layers are<br>
associated with each of the faces of the thin film, which favour the<br>
transport of electrical carriers (holes and electrons); these additional<br>
layers are HTL (Hole Transporting Layer) and ETL (Electron Transporting<br>
Layer) layers. In addition, to improve the injection of holes into the HTL<br>
layer, the latter is combined with an HIL (Hole Injection Layer)<br>
consisting, for example, of copper or zinc phthalocyanine.<br>
In a second family, the organic electroluminescent material of the<br>
thin film consists of polymers (pLEDs) such as, for example, PPV<br>
(poly(para-phenylenevinylene)), PPP (poly(para-phenylene)):, DO-PPP<br>
(poly(2-decyloxy-1,4-phenylene)), MEH-PPV (poly[2-(2'-ethylhexyloxy)-5-<br>
methoxy-1,4-phenylene vinylene)]), CN-PPV (poly[2,5-bis(hexyloxy)-1,4-<br>
phenylene-(1-cyanovinylene)]) or PDAF (poly(dialkylfluorene)); the<br>
polymer layer is also combined with a layer that favours the hole<br>
injection (HIL) consisting, for example, of PEDT/PSS (poly (3,4-ethylene-<br>
dioxythiophene/ poly(4-styrene sulphonate)).<br>
In a third family, the inorganic electroluminescent material<br>
consists of a thin film of, for example, sulphides such as Mn: ZnS or Ce:<br>
SrS or of oxides, such as Mn: Zn2SiO4, Mn: Zn2Ge04 or Mn: Zn2Ga204. In<br>
this case, each of the faces of the thin electroluminescent layer is<br>
combined with an insulating layer produced from a dielectric material,<br>
for example Si3N4, BaTiO3 or Al2O3/TiO2.<br>
In a fourth family, the inorganic electroluminescent material<br>
consists of a thick phosphor layer such as, for example, Mn: ZnS or Cu:<br>
ZnS, this layer being combined with an insulating layer made of a<br>
dielectric material, for example BaTiO3, these layers generally being<br>
produced by screen printing.<br>
Whatever the type of electroluminescent system - organic or<br>
inorganic, thin layer or thick layer, the multilayer comprising especially<br>
the electroluminescent layer is combined with two electrodes (a cathode<br>
and an anode in the case of organic systems).<br>
These electrodes are similar to those already envisaged for the<br>
electrochromic-type active systems.<br>
Likewise, at least one of the glass panes may be bulk-tinted,<br>
especially tinted in blue or green, grey, bronze or brown.<br>
The substrates used in the invention may also be based on a<br>
polymer (PAAMA, PC, etc.). It should also be noted that the substrates may<br>
have very varied geometrical shapes: they may be square or rectangular,<br>
but also any polygon or at least partly curved profile, defined by rounded<br>
or corrugated contours (round, oval, "waves", etc.).<br>
One of the substrates forming the glazing assembly may be opaque,<br>
opacified or a mirror.<br>
The glazing assemblies may constitute a graphic and/or alphanumeric<br>
data display panel, a window for buildings, a rear view mirror, an aircraft<br>
windscreen or cabin window, or a roof window, interior or exterior<br>
glazing for buildings, a shop showcase or countertop, which may be<br>
curved, glazing for protecting an object of the painting type, an antiglare<br>
computer screen, or glass furniture.<br>
Moreover, at least one of the two glass panes may be covered with<br>
a coating having another functionality (this other functionality possibly<br>
being, for example, a solar-protection multilayer, an anti-fouling<br>
multilayer or the like). As a solar-protection multilayer, this may be a<br><br>
thin-film multilayer deposited by sputtering and including at least one<br>
silver layer. It is thus possible to have combinations of the type:<br>
- S1 /solar-protection layers/active system/thermoplastic/S2;<br>
- S1 /active system/thermoplastic/S2.<br>
- S1 /thermoplastic/active system/thermoplastic/S2.<br>
The thermoplastic may be chosen from PVB, PU and EVA.<br>
It is also possible to deposit the solar-protection coating not on one<br>
of the glass panes, but on a sheet of flexible polymer of the PET<br>
(polyethylene terephthalate) type.<br>
For examples of solar-protection coatings, the reader may refer to<br>
Patents EP 826 641, EP 844 219, EP 847 965, WO99/45415 and EP 1 010<br>
677.<br>
However, without departing from the scope of the invention,<br>
certain adaptations may be noted according to the applications or uses of<br>
the invention.<br>
Thus, for building applications, the current leads 5 may comprise<br>
not metal wires but, in this case, may be composed only of metal shins or<br>
other electrically conducting strips that will be placed in direct contact<br>
with the collector 4.<br>
Moreover, in configurations in which lamination of two substrates<br>
S1 and S2 is required, one or other of the substrates may then be used for<br>
providing all of the specific functionalities, such as the solar-control or<br>
low-emissivity functions as described above, these being provided by<br>
multilayers deposited on face 1 or on face 4, or anti-fouling functions<br>
(hydrophilic, hydrophobic, self-cleaning coating) provided by materials<br>
deposited on face 1.<br>
One particular application in which the lamination technique is<br>
used consists of active glazing intended for aviation.<br>
After the substrate S1 has been toughened, the active system is<br>
deposited on face 2 of the said substrate. An ITO-based heating layer is<br>
deposited on face 3 of the substrate S2. This laminated glazing assembly<br>
incorporating an active system may be used with other aviation-type<br>
laminated glazing assemblies (without an active system), such as for<br>
example that according to the provisions of patent FR 2 766 651. It should<br><br>
be pointed out that the laminated glazing assembly incorporating the<br>
active system retains its functionalities at temperatures of around -50°C<br>
and withstands pressure/vacuum cycles.<br>
Another application in which the lamination technique is<br>
encountered consists of the field of toughened glazing for side windows<br>
or windscreens or rear windows or roofs. Such a structure according to<br>
the teachings of the invention is then integrated into the reinforced<br>
glazing configuration (refer to WO 01 /000403 and FR 2 764 841).<br>
Likewise, in a double-glazing configuration, the glazing that<br>
includes the active system in the following configuration: substrate (S1)<br>
active system/polymer f1 /substrate (S2) may be mounted in a<br>
double-glazing assembly, in particular for use in the building sector.<br>
The glazing assembly that includes the active system is then<br>
combined with a gas-filled cavity (the gas being dry air, argon or<br>
argon/air mixture, using known techniques) and with a second glass or<br>
even with a second laminated glass assembly. The two glass assemblies<br>
are separated by a metal spacer (typically based on aluminum) that<br>
includes dehydrating agents or by an organic spacer that includes<br>
dehydrating agents that are combined with sealing mastics and sealants.<br>
The gas-filled cavity is typically between 6 mm and 20 mm in thickness.<br>
The glass panes have a thickness of between 4 mm and 25 mm. The glass<br>
panes may be toughened in order to meet the safety standards specific to<br>
each application. They may be clear, bulk-tinted or covered with an<br>
opacifying coating over part of their surface, in particular for aesthetic<br>
purposes. The lamination is carried out by a known hot compression<br>
assembly technique using one or more transparent, coloured or<br>
opalescent PVB sheets 0.38 mm or 0.76 mm-in -thickness-placed between<br>
the glass panes. The second glass pane or the second laminated glass<br>
assembly may provide additional functions, such as solar-protection<br>
functions, low-emissivity functions, acoustic damping or decoration<br>
functions.<br>
Solar-protection and low-emissivity functions are conventionally<br>
provided by thin-film multilayers generally based on silver, which are<br>
deposited on the glass face which is in contact with the gas cavity of the<br><br>
double-glazing unit. The solar-protection function may also be provided<br>
by multilayers of the TCO/metal/TCO type deposited on a sheet of<br>
polymer of the PET type or by a multilayer of polymer sheets, these then<br>
being incorporated by lamination into the second laminated glass<br>
assembly.<br>
The acoustic damping functions are provided by a PVB that has<br>
undergone a specific treatment in order to improve the acoustic<br>
properties of the laminated glass pane (such as the laminated products<br>
sold under the name SGG Stadip Silence).<br>
It is thus possible to have the following double-glazing<br>
configurations:<br>
substrate S1/active system/f1/S2//gas cavity//multilayer<br>
with a solar-protection or low-emissivity function/glass;<br>
substrate S1/active system/f1/substrate S2/gas<br>
cavity//glass/PVB/multilayer with solar-protection function/PVB/glass;<br>
substrate S1/active system/f1/substrate S2//gas<br>
cavity/ /solar-protection layer or layer with a low-emissivity<br>
function/glass/PVB/glass; and<br>
substrate S1/active system/f1/substrate S2//gas<br>
cavity// glass / PVB / glass.<br>
Anti-reflection functions may be provided on all the faces of the<br>
glass substrates that are in contact with gas (external air, internal air or<br>
gas cavity of the double-glazing) or on only certain faces, depending on<br>
the desired optical appearance.<br>
The invention as described above offers many advantages:<br>
- it makes it possible to obtain a safety glazing assembly of<br>
simplified structure. The glazing assembly forming the subject of the<br>
invention essentially comprises two substrates that sandwich an active<br>
multilayer. Previously, to comply with the safety standards, the use of a<br>
glazing assembly consisting of three substrates is required, a so-called<br>
three-glass assembly. Moreover, the deposition on face 2 of the active<br>
multilayer 3 makes it possible to dispense with the deposition of a solar-<br>
protection layer for the active multilayer, the TCO layer being<br>
sufficiently reflective with respect to infrared radiation.<br>
