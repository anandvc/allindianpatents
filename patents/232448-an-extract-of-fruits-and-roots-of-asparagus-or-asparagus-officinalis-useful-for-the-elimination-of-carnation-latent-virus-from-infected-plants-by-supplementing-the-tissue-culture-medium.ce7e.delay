				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Accordingly the present invention related to an extract of fruits and roots of Asparagus adscendens or Asparagau. officinalis useful for the elimination of carnation Latent Virus from infected plants by supplementing tissue culture medium.<br>
The present invention can be utilized for the production of virus free material from a virus- infected stock using certain plant extracts.<br>
Reference may be made to Duggar and Armstrong (Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden 12:359-366, 1925) who reported that crude extract of pokeweed (phytolacca decandro L.) markedly inhibited the activity of ordinary Tobacco Mosaic Virus. Johnson (Phytopathology 31: 679-701, 1941) observed that extracts of phytolacca rigida almost completely inhibited Tobacco Mosaic Virus even after aging in vitro for long periods. The extracts of leaves of spinach, garden beet, sugar beet and chard when mixed in equal parts with the inocula of TMV and Cabbage Mosaic Virus completely or almost completely inhibited their activity. When spinach extract was mixed in equal parts with the inocula of Tobacco Ring Spot Virus, Latent Potato spot Virus and Cucumber Mosaic Virus, the infectivity of these inocula was also completely or nearly completely inhibited (Kuntz and Walker, Phytopathology 37:561-579, 1947). Sill and Walker (Phytopathology 42:349-352, 1952) reported presence of inhibitors in resistant variety of cucumber against CMV.<br>
The main drawback of these reports were:<br>
1)	The extracts used though have shown inhibition of viruses, complete retrieval has not<br>
been achieved.<br>
2)	The techniques have not been used under in vitro cultures and so of no use for<br>
producing virus free plant material through tissue culture techniques, especially in<br>
plants   where   such   procedures   are   becoming   standard   procedures   for   mass<br>
multiplication.<br>
3)	In the earlier reports virus inhibitors were analyzed only on the basis of symptoms<br>
and specific tests were not done to confirm inhibition by the extracts.<br><br>
The process of present invention is novel in the sense that so far no plant material has ever been used to retrieve virus free plants under in vitro conditions. Further the extracts of fruits/roots of Asparagus species the test plant material used here in, has never been reported to contain virus elimination/inhibition properties and there exists no report in literature where in use of plant extracts has been reported to be capable of virus elimination.<br>
Thus the main object of the present invention in to provide a plant based material for in vitro use for virus elimination which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above. Another object of the present invention is to find out a non toxic environmental friendly cure for plant viruses. Still another object of present invention is to put constructive use the gene pool available in the country for retrieval of viruses under in vitro conditions.<br>
Accordingly this invention relates to an extract of Asparagus adscendens or A. officinalis, useful for the elimination of Carnation Latent Virus from infected plants, by supplementing the tissue culture medium as herein described, which comprises, i   Collection of plant parts such as fruits and roots of said Asparagus species, ii  Refluxing said parts of the plants with benzene on boiling water bath, iii Filtration of soluble contents so obtained in step (ii), iv Combining of contents of step (iii) obtained from different parts especially fruits and<br>
roots of plant separately,<br>
v Evaporation of the solvent from contents of step (iv) on boiling water bath, vi Refluxing contents of step (v) with acetone To Obtain The Said Extract preferably<br>
refluxed thrice with acetone, vii Optionally mixing the said extract with MS medium as here in discussed.<br>
Stepwise details of the process are:<br>
1.	Fruits and Roots of plants of Asparagus species, particularly A. adscendens Roxb. An<br>
the like are collected.<br>
2.	1 OOg of each are refluxed with benzene on boiling water bath and the contents filtered.<br>
3.	Benzene extracts of roots and fruits are combined separately and the solvent<br>
evaporated on boiling water bath.<br><br>
4. The extracts are then refluxed with acetone and the final extracts are dried in<br>
vacuum.<br>
5 The extract so obtained may be stored in a refrigerator for further use. 6. The extract obtained in step (v) may optionally be used under in vitro/in vivo<br>
conditions for elimination of viruses specifically against eliminating carnation latent<br>
virus under in vitro conditions.<br>
The details of the process are:<br>
The fruits and the roots of plants of Asparagus species, particularly^, adscendens and the like were collected and benzene extracts were prepared from lOOg of the material. These extracts were then refluxed with acetone and the extracts so obtained were used as ingredients in media alongwith other hormones after final drying in vacuum.<br>
For in vitro elimination of carnation latent virus the extract so obtained may optionally be used as followed:<br>
In order to add these extracts in culture medium their stock solutions of higher concentration are prepared in liquid multiplication medium for carnation containing MS salts, 0.30 to 0.45 mg/1, preferably 0.37 mg/1 inositol, 2.00 to 2.30 mg/1, preferably 2.15 mg/1 kinetin; 25-35 g/1, preferably 30g/l sucrose and finally multiplication medium having four different concentrations viz. 1.0, 2.5 5.0 and 7.5 mg/1 of each extract are prepared.<br>
Nodal explants from Carnation Latent Virus infected plants of carnations cv. Scania or from their established cultures may be subcultured on these media and their effect on virus concentration recorded using Alkaline phosphatase based direct antigen coating indirect ELISA system against Carnation Latent Virus.<br>
The fruit fractions in Acetone were able to inhibit the virus completely at 7.5 mg/1 concentration whereas in case of root fraction a mild reaction was observed between 1.0 and 2.5 mg/1 concentrations and a strong negative reaction between 5.0 and 7.5 mg/1 concentrations.<br><br>
The present invention eliminates completely the Carnation Latent Virus from carnation under in vitro conditions using acetone extracts of fruits and roots of A. adscendens and the like.<br>
Thus the main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
1.	In the present invention partially purified extracts of fruits and roots of Asparagus<br>
species have been used.<br>
2.	The extracts have been used under in vitro conditions.<br>
3.	Complete retrieval of virus free plants of Carnation cv. Scania has been achieved,<br>
using the extract.<br>
4.	The extract is environmental friendly.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1:<br>
Fruits of Asparagus adscendens Roxb. Were collected and dried separately. lOOg of each was refluxed thrice with 250ml benzene on boiling water bath for 2 hours and contents were filtered.
