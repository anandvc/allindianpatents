				<td>A process for the preparation of (-)-secoisolariciresinol from a new natural source namely stereospermum personatum useful as an antioxidant.<br>
This invention relates to the isolation of compound namely (-)-Secoisolariciresinol from a new plant source Stereospermum personatum. The compound (-)-Secoisolariciresinol {2,3 Bis - [4-hydroxy -3- (methoxyphenyl) methyl]-1,4-butanediol} is isolated from new source in good yield.<br>
It is proved to be useful and better antioxidant molecule than the presently used medicinally important lipophilic antioxidants Prubucol and a-Tocopherol. It may have better therapeutic potential in inflammatory disease conditions, atherosclerosis, diabetic complications, cancer, hepatotoxicity and variety of disease conditions mediated through or fostered by oxidative stress and / or overt oxidative burden due to increased generation or under scavenging of free radicals.<br>
There is a considerable amount of epidemiological evidence indicating association between diet rich in fruits and vegetables and a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease and certain forms of cancer. It is generally assumed that the active principles contributing to these protective effects are nothing but primarily, the antioxidant phytochemicals.<br>
Research in the past decades have accumulated enough evidence to show the beneficial effect of free-radical scavengers/antioxidants as antimutagenic, anti-inflammatory, antiamerosclerotic, antidiabetic, antihepatotoxic, antiageing and in a variety of neurological disorders. The search for new antioxidant principles is becoming therefore, essential to improve the pharmacological treatment of pathological conditions such as cataract, rheumatic diseases, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenarative conditions.<br>
The pharmacological approaches therefore have focused on the search of potential resources rich in with antioxidant principles. The medicinal importance of plants bearing rich proportion of antioxidant principles is therefore becoming hot item.<br>
Stereospermum personatum is a medicinal plant used in traditional Indian System of Medicine and is widely advocated in the preparations for diuretic, lithontriptic, expectorant, cardiotonic, aphrodisiac, appetizer, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, dyspepsia, diarrhea, renal and vesical calculi, cough, asthma, hyperdipsia, haemorrhoids and hyperacidity disease conditions (Indian Medicinal Plants, Vol 5 p 192). It is further reported to possess antibacterial, antifungal, hypoglycemic activity, and against p388<br><br>
Lymphocytic leukemic cells (Ind. Jour, of Exp. Biol., 1971,9, 100). Hence, it becomes pertinent to look for the molecules possessing such important biological properties. In this connection, the phytochemical investigation of Stereospermum personatum has been taken up. The applicants have isolated (-)-Secoisolariciresinol in good yields. (-)-Secoisolariciresinol is known to possess several activities, which are shown in Table 1.<br>

Example-l<br>
Experimental protocol: A process for the isolation of above lignans. The dried wood powder of Stereospermum personatum (3 Kg) was loaded on a Soxhlet apparatus. The powder was first extracted with hexane. The residue from the extraction of hexane was further extracted with chloroform. The chloroform solution was concentrated under vacuum. The dark brown extract (22 g) was adsorbed on silica gel (60-120 mesh) and loaded on silica gel (60-120 mesh) column. (4 cm dia to a height of 100 cms). The column is subjected to elution with chloroform methanol gradient. The chloroform-methanol gradient is so selected to obtain specific fraction and thereby the desired compound. In the present case, the fractions eluted at 3% methanol in chloroform are collected separately and concentrated.<br>
The above fractions are subjected to further purification using silica gel column ( &gt;200mesh, 2.5 cm dia and 50 cm length) using chloroform methanol gradient. The eluent at 3% methanol in chloroform gave pure (-)-Secoisolariciresinol (0.9 g). The spectrochemical data of (-)-Secoisolariciresinol are given below:<br>
