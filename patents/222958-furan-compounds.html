				<td> This invention relates to Furan compounds, more particularly to EP4 receptor antagonists, pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds, and the use of such compounds and compositions to treat various diseases.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
Postanoids comprise prostaglandins (PGs)  and thromboxanes (Txs) and their receptors fall into five different classes (DP, EP,FP, IP and TP) based on their sensitivity to the five naturally occurring prostanoids, PGD2, PGE2, PGF2c(, PGI2 and TxA2, respectively (Coleman, R. A., Prostanoid Receptors. IUPHAR       compendium        of       receptor       characterisation        and classification,     2nd edition,  338-353,  ISBN  0-9533510-3-3, 2000). EP receptors (for which the endogenous ligand is PGE2) have been subdivided into four types termed EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4. These four types of EP receptors have been cloned and are distinct at both a molecular and pharmacological level (Coleman, R.A., 2000) .<br>
EP4 antagonists have been shown to be useful in the treatment of pain, and in particular, in the treatment of primary headache disorders, which include migraines, and secondary headache disorders, such as drug-induced headaches (W) 00/18405 and WO 01/72302). Dilation of the cerebral vasculature and the subsequent stimulation of pain stimulating, perivascular trigeminal sensory afferent nerves is recognized to play an important role in the pathophysiology of migraine. A sterile inflammatory response, associated with activation of cycloxyenase and the generation of PGE2, is also implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine. PGE2 levels have been shown to be raised during migraine     attacks     and     PGE2     contributes     to<br><br>
the pain of migraine by directly dilating cerebral arteries and by stimulating the release of vasoactive/pro-inf lammatory peptides from the trigeminal nerves.  These effects of PGE2 are mediated in whole or in part by EP4 receptors. Thus, by binding to and preventing the stimulation of EP4 receptors, EP$ antagonists may be used to treat the pain of migraine.<br>
antagonists may also be useful in treating a number of other conditions and diseases.  For example, they may be used in:<br>
the treatment of pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, gouty arthritis and juvenile arthritis;<br>
the treatment of musculoskeletal pain, lower back and neck pain, sprains and strains, neuropathic pain, sympathetically mediated pain, myositis, pain associated with cancer and fibromyalgia, pain associated with influenza or other viral infections, such as the common cold, rheumatic fever; pain associated with bowel disorders such as non-ulcer dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome; non-cardiac chest pain, pain associated with myocardial ischaemia, post-operative pain, headache, toothache and dysmeriorrhea. Neuropathic pain syndromes include diabetic neuropathy, sciatica, nonspecific lower back pain, multiple sclerosis pain, fibromyalgia, HIV-related neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia and pain resulting from physical trauma;<br>
the treatment of inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid and osteoarthritis, psoriasis, dermatitis, retinitis, conjunctivitis, asthma, bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, inflammatory bowel disease, colitis, nephritis, gingivitis and hepatitis; the treatment of cancers including familial adenomatous<br>
polyposis, endometrial carcinoma, colorectal and cervical<br>
cancer;<br>
the treatment of bone disorders involving altered bone<br>
formation or resorption such as osteoporosis;<br>
women's health for the treatment of myometrial and<br>
endometrial disorders;<br>
the treatment of gastrointestinal disease including<br>
diarrhoea;<br>
the treatment of immunological disorders such as autoimmune<br>
disease, immunological deficiency diseases, organ<br>
transplantation and increasing the latency of HIV infection;<br>
the treatment of diseases of abnormal platelet function.<br>
(e.g. occlusive vascular diseases);<br>
the preparation of a drug with diuretic properties to treat<br>
or prevent various oedema, hypertension, premenstrual<br>
tension, urinary calculus, oliguri.a, hyperphosphaturia,<br>
mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, chronic renal<br>
failure or the like;<br>
the treatment of impotence or erectile dysfunction, and<br>
female sexual dysfunction;<br>
the treatment of hair growth disorders;<br>
the treatment of sleep disorders such as narcolepsy and<br>
insomnia;<br>
the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and shock states<br>
associated with hypotension (e.g. septic shock);<br>
the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and for<br>
preventing neuronal damage following stroke, cardiac arrest,<br>
cardiopulmonary bypass, traumatic brain injury or spinal<br>
cord injury;<br>
the treatment of tinnitus;<br>
the treatment of dependence; and<br>
the treatment of complications of diabetes.<br>
Although EP4 antagonists are known, it is desired to find<br>
novel EP4 antagonists, and in particular, EP4 antagonists which are selective against other EP receptors, i.e. EPi, EP2 and EP3.<br>

Includes Other Forms<br>
Unless otherwise specified, included in the above are the well known ionic, salt, solvate, and protected forms of these substituents.  For example, a reference to carboxylic acid (-COOH) also includes the anionic (cdrboxylate) form (-COCT) , a salt or solvate thereof, as well as conventional<br>
protected forms.  Similarly, a reference to an amino group includes the protonated form (-t^HF^R2) , a salt or solvate of the amino group, for example, a hydrochloride salt, as well as conventional protected forms of an amino group. Similarly, a reference to a hydroxyl group also includes the anionic form (-0"), a salt or solvate thereof, as well as conventional protected forms of a hydroxyl group.<br>
Isomers, Salts, Solvates and Protected Forms Certain compounds may exist in one or more particular geometric, optical, enantiomeric, diasteriomeric, epimeric, stereoisomeric, tautomeric, conformational, or anomeric forms, including but not limited to, cis- and trans-forms; E- and Z-forms; c-, t-, and r- forms; endo- and exo-forms; R-, S-, and meso-forms; D- and L-forms; d- and 1-forms; (+) and (-) forms; keto-, enol-, and eholate-forms; syn- and anti-forms; synclinal- and anticlinal-forms; a- and (3-forms; axial and equatorial forms; boat-, chair-, twist-, envelope-, and halfchair-forms; and combinations thereof, hereinafter collectively referred to as "isomers" (or "isomeric forms").<br>
Note that, except as discussed below for tautomeric forms, specifically excluded from the term "isomers", as used herein, are structural (or constitutional) isomers (i.e. isomers which differ in the connections between atoms rather than merely by the position of atoms in space).  For example, a reference to a methoxy group, -OCHs, is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer, a hydroxymethyl group, -CH2OH.  Similarly, a reference to ortho-chlorophenyl is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer, meta-chlorophenyl.  However, a reference to a class of structures may well include structurally isoineric forms falling within that class<br>
 (e.g. Ci_7alkyl includes n-propyl and iso-propyl; butyl includes n-, iso-, sec-, and tert-butyl; methoxyphenyl includes ortho-, meta-, and para-methoxyphenyl).<br>
The above exclusion does not pertain to tautomeric forms, for example, keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms, as in, for example, the following tautomeric pairs: keto/enol (illustrated below), imine/enamine, amide/imino alcohol, amidine/amidine, nitroso/oxime, thioketone/enethiol, N-nitroso/hyroxyazo, and nitro/aci-nitro.<br>
(Figure Removed)     <br>
Note that specifically included in the term "isomer" are compounds with one or more isotopic substitutions.  For example, H may be in any isotopic form, including aH, 2H (D), and 3H (T) ; C may be in any isotopic form, including 12C, 13C, and 14C; O may be in any isotopic form, including 160 and 180; and the like.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, a reference to a particular compound includes all such isomeric forms, including (wholly or partially) racernic and other mixtures thereof.  Methods for the preparation (e.g. asymmetric synthesis) and separation (e.g. fractional crystallisation and chromatographic means) of such isomeric forms are either known in the art or are readily obtained by adapting the methods taught herein, or known methods, in a known manner.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, a reference to a particular compound also includes ionic, salt, solvate, and protected forms of thereof, for example, as discussed below.<br>
It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle a corresponding salt of the active compound, for example, a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt.  Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are discussed in Berge, et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 66, 1-19 (1977).<br>
For example, if the compound is anionic, or has a functional group which may be anionic (e.g. -COOH may be -COO"), then a salt may be formed with a suitable cation.  Examples of suitable inorganic cations include, but are not limited to, alkali metal ions such as Na+ and K+, alkaline earth cations such as Ca2"1" and Mg2*, and other cations such as Al+3. Examples of suitable organic cations include, but are not limited to, ammonium ion (i.e. NH/) and substituted ammonium ions (e.g. NHaR"1", NH2R2% NHR3+, NR4+) .  Examples of some suitable substituted ammonium ions are those derived from: ethylamine, diethylamine, dicyclohexylamine, triethylamine, butylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperazine, benzylamine, phenylbenzylamine, choline, meglumine, and tromethamine, as well as amino acids, such as lysine and arginine.  An example of a common quaternary ammonium ion is N(CH3)4+.<br>
If the compound is cationic, or has a functional group which may be cationic (e.g. -NH2 may be -NH3+) , then a salt may be formed with a suitable anion.  Examples of suitable inorganic anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the folio-wing inorganic acids: hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, sulfuric, sulfurous, nitric, nitrous, phosphoric, and phosphorous.<br>
Examples of suitable organic anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following organic acids: 2-acetyoxybenzoic, acetic, ascorbic, aspartic, benzoic,<br>
camphorsulfonic, cinnamic, citric, edetic, ethanedisulfonic, ethanesulfonic, fumaric, glucoheptonic, gluconic, glutamic, glycolic, hydroxymaleic, hydroxynaphthalene carboxylic, isethionic, lactic, lactobionic, lauric, maleic, malic, methanesulfonic, mucic, oleic, oxalic, palmitic, pamoic, pantothenic, phenylacetic, phenylsulfonic, propionic, pyruvic, salicylic, stearic, succinic, sulfanilic, tartaric, toluenesulfonic, and valeric.  Examples of suitable polymeric organic anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following polymeric acids: tannic acid, carboxymethyl cellulose.<br>
It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle a corresponding solvate of the active compound.  The term "solvate" is used herein in the conventional sense to refer to a complex of solute (e.g., active compound, salt of active compound) and solvent.  If the solvent is water, the solvate may be conveniently referred to as a hydrate, for example, a mono-hydrate, a di-hydrate, a tri-hydrate, etc.<br>
It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle the active compound in a chemically protected form. The term ^chemically protected form" is used herein in the conventional chemical sense and pertains to a compound in which one or more reactive functional groups are protected from undesirable chemical reactions under specified conditions (e.g. pH, temperature, radiation, solvent, and the like).  In practice, well known chemical methods are employed to reversibly render unreactive a functional group, which otherwise would be reactive, under specified conditions.  In a chemically protected form, one or more reactive functional groups are in the form of a protected or protecting group (also known as a masked or masking group or a blocked or blocking group).  By protecting a reactive<br>
functional group, reactions involving other unprotected reactive functional groups can be performed, without affecting the protected group; the protecting group may be removed, usually in a subsequent step, without substantially affecting the remainder of the molecule.  See, for example, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (T. Green and P. Wuts; 3rd Edition; John Wiley and Sons, 1999) .<br>
A wide variety of such "protecting", "blocking", or '"masking" methods are widely used and well known in organic synthesis.  For example, a compound which has two nonequ'ivalent reactive functional groups, both of which would be reactive under specified conditions, may be derivatized to render one of the functional groups "protected," and therefore unreactive, under the specified conditions; so protected, the compound may be used as a reactant which has effectively only one reactive functional group.  After the desired reaction (involving the other functional group) is complete, the protected group may be "deprotected" to return it to its original functionality.<br>
For example, a hydroxy group may be protected as an ether (-OR) or an ester (-OC(=0)R), for example, as: a t-butyl<br>
ether; a benzyl, benzhydryl (diphenylmethyl), or trityl (triphenylmethyl) ether; a trimethylsilyl or<br>
t-butyldimethylsilyl ether; or an acetyl ester (-OC(=O)CH3,<br>
-OAc).<br>
For example, an aldehyde or ketone group may be protected as an acetal (R-CH(OR)2) or ketal (R2C(OR)2), respectively, in which the carbonyl group (&gt;C=0) is converted to a diether (&gt;C(OR)2), by reaction with, for example, a primary alcohol. The aldehyde or ketone group is readily regenerated by<br>
hydrolysis using a large excess of water in the presence of acid.<br>
For example, an amine group may be protected, for example, as an amide (-NRCO-R) or a urethane (-NRCO-OR), for example, as: an acetamide (-NHCO-CH3) ; a benzyloxy amide (-NHCO-OCH2C6H5, -NH-Cbz) ; as a t-butoxy amide (-NHCO-OC (CH3) 3, -NH-Boc) ,- a 2-biphenyl-2-propoxy amide (-NHCO-OC^CHsJzCeH/jCeHs, -NH-Bpoc) , as a 9-fluorenylmethoxy amide (-NH-Fmoc) , as a 6-nitroveratryloxy amide (-NH-Nvoc), as a 2-trimethylsilylethyloxy amide (-NH-Teoc), as a 2,2,2-trichloroethyloxy amide (-NH-Troc), as an allyloxy amide (-NH-Alloc) , as a 2(-phenylsulfonyl)ethyloxy amide (-NH-Psec); or, in suitable cases (e.g., cyclic amines), as a nitroxide radical (&gt;N-O) .<br>
For example, a carboxylic acid group may be protected as an ester for example, as: an Ci-7 alkyl ester (e.g., a methyl ester; a t-butyl ester); a Ci_7 haloalkyl ester (e.g., a CI-T trihaloalkyl ester) ; a triCi-7 alkylsilyl-Ci-7 alkyl ester; or a C5_2o aryl-Ci-? alkyl ester (e.g. a benzyl ester; a nitrobenzyl ester); or as an amide, for example, as a methyl amide.<br>
For example, a thiol group may be protected as a thioether (-SR) , for example, as: a benzyl thioether; an acetamidomethyl ether (-S-CH2NHC(=0)CH3) .<br>
The term ""treatment", as used herein in the context of treating a condition, pertains generally to treatment and therapy, whether of a human or an animal (e.g. in veterinary applications), in which some desired therapeutic effect is achieved, for example, the inhibition of the progress of the condition, and includes a reduction in the rate of progress,<br>
a halt in the rate of progress, amelioration of the condition, and cure of the condition.  Treatment as a prophylactic measure (i.e. prophylaxis) is also included.<br>
The term "therapeutically-effective amount", as used herein, pertains to that amount of an active compound, or a material, composition or dosage form comprising an active compound, which is effective for producing some desired therapeutic effect, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, when administered in accordance with a desired treatment regimen. Suitable dose ranges will typically be in the range of from 0.01 to 20 mg/kg/day, preferably from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day.<br>
Compositions and their administration<br>
Compositions may be formulated for any suitable route and means of administration.  Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents include those used in formulations suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural) administration.  The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy.  Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients.  In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.<br>
For solid compositions, conventional non-toxic solid carriers include, for example, pharmaceutical grades of<br>
mannitol, lactose, cellulose, cellulose derivatives, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, talcum, glucose, sucrose, magnesium carbonate, and the like may be used.  The active compound as defined above may be formulated as suppositories using, for example, polyalkylene glycols, acetylated triglycerides and the like, as the carrier. Liquid pharmaceutically administrable compositions can, for example, be prepared by dissolving, dispersing, etc, an active compound as defined above and optional pharmaceutical adjuvants in a carrier, such as, for example, water, saline aqueous dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, and the like, to thereby form a solution or suspension.  If desired, the pharmaceutical composition to be administered may also contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents and the like, for example, sodium acetate, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine sodium acetate, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine oleate, etc.  Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art; for example, see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 20th edition, pub. Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2000.  The composition or formulation to be administered will, in any event, contain a quantity of the active compound(s) in an amount effective to alleviate the symptoms of the subject being treated.<br>
Dosage forms or compositions containing active ingredient in the range of 0.25 to 95% with the balance made up from non-toxic carrier may be prepared.<br>
For oral administration, a pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic composition is formed by the incorporation of any of the normally employed excipients, such as, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, cellulose,<br>
cellulose derivatives, sodium crosscarmellose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, talcum, glucose, sucrose, magnesium carbonate, and the like.  Such compositions take the form of solutions, suspensions, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained release formulations and the like.  Such compositions may contain l%-95% active ingredient, more preferably 2-50%, most preferably 5-8%.<br>
Parenteral administration is generally characterized by injection, either subcutaneously,.intramuscularly or intravenously.  Injectables can be prepared in conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions, solid forms suitable for solution or suspension in liquid prior to injection, or as emulsions.  Suitable excipients are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol or the like.  In addition, if desired, the pharmaceutical compositions to be administered may also contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents and the like, such as for example, sodium acetate, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine oleate, triethanolamine sodium acetate, etc.<br>
The percentage of active compound contained in such parental compositions is highly dependent on the specific nature thereof, as well as the activity of the compound and the needs of the subject.  However, percentages of active ingredient of 0.1% to 10% in solution are employable, and will be higher if the composition is a solid which will be subsequently diluted to the above percentages.  Preferably, the composition will comprise 0.2-2% of the active agent in solution.<br>

Compounds of the invention wherein R5 is of formula (II):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
may be synthesised from the analogous compound of the invention wherein R5 is carboxy, by reaction with a compound of formula 1: O<br>
in basic conditions, preferably aided by a coupling agent, for example, 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride.<br><br>
Compounds of the invention wherein R5 is of formula (III):     <br>
I   Omay be synthesized from a compound of formula 2:<br><br>
by reaction with a compound of formula 3<br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
wherein X is either OH or halo, where if X is OH, the use of basic conditions and a coupling agent is preferred.<br>
Compounds of formulae (1) and 2, or where the group -A-R5 is present as a precursor or protected form, may be represented as compounds of formula 4:<br><br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
where R6 is -A-R5 or its precursor or protected form. The protecting groups used may be conventional, or the group may be resin-bound.  If Y is v - (CH2) n-0- or -(CH2)n-S-, then these compounds can be synthesised from compounds of formula 5:<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
by one of two possible routes.<br>
In the first route, a compound of formula 6:<br>
R?—X'H   Formula 6<br>
, where X' is S or 0, is coupled to a compound of formula 5<br>
using the Mitsunobu reaction, for example by treatment with<br>
triphenyl phosphine (PhaP) and diisopropylazodicarboxylate<br>
(DIAD) .<br>
The second route is a two stage route, the first stage being the Mitsunobu coupling of a compound of formula 7a:<br>
Hal—Ar-X'H    Formula 7a<br>
wherein Ar1 is the first Ce aryl component of R3 and Hal is I or Br followed by a Suzuki coupling of a compound of formula 8a (or equivalent ester of formula 8c) : <br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
wherein Ar2 is the second Ce aryl component of R3.  The Suzuki coupling may be achieved using, for example, [1,1'-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]dichloropalladium (II) as the palladium catalyst.<br>
This route may also be 'reversed' such that the Mitsunobu coupling is of a boronic acid of formula 7b (or preferably equivalent ester of formula 7c):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein Ar1 is the first Ce aryl component of R3, followed by a Suzuki coupling of a compound of formula 8b:<br>
Ar2—Hal    Formula 8b<br>
wherein Ar2 is the second C6 aryl component of R3 and Hal is<br>
I or Br.<br>
If the compound of formula 7b or 7c is not readily available then a compound of formula 7d:<br>
HX1—Ar-Br    Formula 7d<br>
may be coupled, followed by conversion of the brorno group to the required boronic acid or ester.<br>
Compounds of formula 4 where Y is -(CH2)n-NH- can also be synthesized from compounds of formula 5.   In one method, the alcohols of formula 5 are oxidized to the corresponding aldehyde, for example using the Dess-Martin reagent, followed by reductive coupling to an amine, which may be of formula 6':<br>
R3—NH2   Formulae1<br>
or of formula la', 7b' or 7c': Hal—ArLNH2   Formula 7a'<br>
H2N-ArLB(OH)? Formula 7b(Figure Removed)<br>
for subsequent Suzuki coupling.  The reductive coupling can be carried out using sodium cyanoborohydride.<br>
37<br>
In another method, the alcohol of formula 5 is converted to the corresponding halide, using a halogenating reagent , for example conversion to chlorine using 4-methyl-benzene sulfonyl chloride, followed by coupling to an amine which may be of formula 6', or of formula 7a', 7b' or 7c' for subsequent Suzuki coupling.  The amine coupling is carried out in the presence of potassium iodide, or equivalent reagents.  This method can also be used to couple alcohols and thiols of formulae 6, 7a, 7b and 7d, where X' is 0 or S.<br>
Compounds of formula 4:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
where Y is -C(=0)-NRm- may be synthesised from a compound of formula 9:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
by reaction with a amine of formula 10:<br>

Compounds of formula (I) where A is a single bond, and R5 is carboxy, and compounds where the group -Y-R3 is present as a precursor or protected form, may be represented as compounds of formula 12:<br>
where R7 is -Y-R3 or its precursor or protected form.  These compounds may be synthesised from compounds of formula 13:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
by treatment with n-butyllithium, followed by carbon dioxide at low temperatures.<br>
In a similar fashion, compounds of formula 2 where A is a single bond, and R5 is carboxy, and compounds where the<br>
qroup -Y-R3 is present as a precursor or protected form, may be represented as compounds of formula 14:<br><br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
where R7 is -Y-R3 or its precursor or protected form.  These compounds may be synthesised from compounds of formula 13:<br>

Compounds of formula (I) where A is a -C2H4-, and R5 is carboxy, and compounds where the group -Y-R3 is present as a precursor or protected form, may be represented as compounds of formula 15:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
where R7 is -Y-R3 or its precursor or protected form.  These compounds may be synthesised from compounds of formula 16:<br><br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
by hydrogenation, using a palladium catalyst.<br>
Compounds of formula 16 may be synthesised from compounds of formula 17:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
by the Wittig coupling of an acetic ester, using, for example, triethylphosphonoacetate as the Wittig reagent, followed by hydolysis under alkaline conditions, e.g. lithium hydroxide in a suitable solvent, e.g. aqueous alcohol.<br>
Compounds of formula 17 may also be used to synthesise compounds of formula 18:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
where R2 and R7 are as defined above.  The reaction proceeds via a cyano intermediate which may be obtained by treating<br>
compounds of formula 17 with hydroxylamine to form the oxime derivative, which can be dehydrated to the cyano compound with, for example, 2-chloro-l,3-dimethylimidazolium chloride in the presence of a base.  The cyano intermediate can be converted into compounds of formula 18 by treatment with sodium azide, in the presence of a base.<br>
Compounds where Y is - (CH2)n-S (=0) - and - (CH2)n-S (=0) 2- may be obtained from the corresponding compound where Y is -(CH2)n~S- by oxidation with a peracid, for example 3-chloro-benzenecarboperoxoic acid.<br>
Compounds where Y is - (CH2)n-NRN1- may be obtained from the corresponding compound where Y is -(CH2)n-NH- by direction alkylation by RN11, in the presence of a weak base.<br>
The starting materials described above are generally commercially available or synthesisable using known methods. For example, example 22A below describes a method of synthesizing 2-substitued furans.<br>
Some of the reaction steps described above may be carried out using resins, as is shown in the examples.<br>
Preferences<br>
The following preferences may be combined with one another,<br>
and may be different for each aspect of the present<br>
invention.<br>
R2 is preferably selected from H or an optionally substituted Ci_3 alkyl group, more preferably H, methyl, CFj or iso-propyl, and most preferably R2 is a- a methyl group.<br>
Y is preferably -(CH2)n-X-, and n is preferably 1.  X is<br>
preferably 0, S or NH, with NH being the most preferred.  In some embodiments the preferred option for Y is -CH2-0-.<br>
If Y is -C(=0)NRN2-, then RN2 is preferably selected from H, and optionally substituted Ci_4 alkyl, in particular Me.<br>
The C6 aryl groups of R3 are preferably independently selected from those derived from benzene and heteroaryl groups, where the heteroatom or heteroatoms are nitrogen. Most preferred are Cg aryl groups derived from benzene, pyridine and 1,3-pyrimidine.  It is further preferred that either both Ce aryl groups are derived from benzene or that one group is derived from benzene and the other from pyridine or 1, 3-pyrimidine, with pyridine being preferred, especially as the aryl group furthest from the furan core.<br>
If both Ce aryl groups are derived from benzene, it is preferred that there is not an oxygen bridge between the two rings, bound adjacent the link on both rings, i.e. that Ra is optionally substituted biphenyl rather than optionally substituted dibenzofuranyl.<br>
If one or more of the Ce aryl groups is derived frcm pyridine, then it is preferred that the nitrogen ring atom is adjacent the link between the two rings that make up the R3 group.<br>
If one or more of the Ce aryl groups is derived from 1,3-pyrimidine, then it is preferred that the link between the two rings that make up the R3 group is between the two nitrogen atoms.<br>
It is further preferred that that the single bond joining the two Ce aryl groups is in the 4-position of the ring<br>
bound to Y.  Thus, 4-phenyl-phenyl is preferred to 3-phenyl-phenyl;  dibenzofuran-3-yl is preferred to di-benzofuran-2-yl, 4-pyridin-2-yl-phenyl is preferred to 3-pyridin-2-yl-phenyl and 6-phenyl-pyridin-3-yl is preferred to 6-phenyl-pyridin-2-yl:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Both C&amp; aryl groups of R3 are optionally substituted, although it is preferred that only the Cg aryl group not bound to Y is substituted.<br>
Preferred substituents on the Ce aryls of R3 include, but are not limited to: optionally substituted Ci-? alkyl groups, more preferably methyl and substituted C!_4 alkyl groups, e.g. -CFa, CH2OH; Ci-7 alkoxy groups, more preferably GI--J alkoxy groups, e.g.  OMe, -OCF3, -OEt, -OCHF2; Ci--, thioether group, more preferably Cx-4 thioether group, e.g. -SMe; amino groups, optionally substituted by one or two Ci-4 alkyl groups, e.g. -NMe2/ halo groups, more preferably -F or -Cl; cyano; alkoxylene groups, more preferably -0-r'H2-0-; Ci-4 acyl groups, more preferably -C(=O)Me.<br>
The preferred location for a substituent on the Ce aryl group not bound to Y is para to the bond between the two<br><br>
aryl groups, with the meta position being less preferred. Therefore, if R3 is 4-phenyl-phenyl, the substituent is preferably at the 4'-position.<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention A is.preferably a single bond, whereas in other embodiments A is preferably a Ci-s alkylene group.  In particular, when R5 is carboxy, A is more preferably a Ci-3 alkylene group, with vinylene being most preferred.<br>
R5 is preferably either:<br>
(i)  a group of formula (II): (Figure Removed)<br>
with a group of formula (II) being more preferred.<br>
The above preference for R5 is particularly applicable when R2 is methyl and Y is -CH2-0-.<br>
Where R5 is of formula (II) of (III), R is preferably selected from an optionally substituted CS-ZQ aryl group, and an optionally substituted C5_2o aryl-Ci-7 alkyl group, wherein the Ci_7 alkyl group is more preferably methyl.  In these groups the C5_2o aryl group is preferably a heteroaryl group, itself preferably having a single aromatic ring.  Such groups may preferably be substituted with Ci_4 alkyl groups, such as methyl and hydroxy.  Thus, preferred R groups<br><br>
include, but are not limited to: phenyl; benzyl; 3,5, dimethyl-isoxazol-4-yl; thiophen-2-yl; 5-methyl-pyridin-yl; and 4~hydroxy-phenyl.<br>
If R in formula (II) or (III) is a Ci_7 alkyl group, it is more preferably a Ci_4 alkyl group, for example methyl or propyl.<br>

Example 42: Biological Results<br>
Binding ability to human EP receptors<br>
Membranes were prepared from cells stably transfected with human EP receptor cDNA. In brief, cells were cultured to confluency, scraped from culture flasks, and centrifuged (800 g, 8 minutes, 4°C). Cells were twice washed in ice cold homogenisation buffer containing 10 mMTris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA.2Na, 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM PMSF, 0 . 3 mM indomethacin, pH 7.4, homogenised and re-centrifuged as before. The supernatant was stored on ice and pellets re-homogenised and re-spun. Supernatants were pooled and centrifuged at 40000g,<br>
10 minutes, 4°C. Resultant membrane pellets were stored at -80°C until use.<br>
For assay, membranes expressing human EP4, EPs, EP2 or receptors were incubated in Millipore (MHVBN45) plates containing assay buffer, radiolabelled [3H]PGE2 and 0 . 1 to 10 000 nM concentrations of compounds. Incubations were performed at suitable temperatures and for suitable times to allow equilibrium to be reached. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of lOuM PGEa • Bound and free radiolabel was separated by vacuum manifold filtration using appropriate wash buffers, and bound radiolabel was<br>
determined by scintillation counting. Constituents of each of the buffers are included in table 1 below.<br><br>
The affinity or pKi of each compound for each receptor was calculated from the concentration causing 50% radioligand displacement (IC50) using the Cheng-Prusoff equation:<br><br>
(radioligand concentration \        radioligand KD        }<br><br>
