				<td>STRUCTURALLY-MODIFIED POLYMER FLOCCULANTS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention is directed to structurally-modified<br>
water-soluble polymers prepared by initiating<br>
polymerization of an aqueous solution of monomers under<br>
free radical polymerization and adding at least one<br>
modifier after at least 30% polymerization of the<br>
monomers has occurred, and to the use of the polymers as<br>
flocculants.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Water-soluble polymeric flocculants are commonly<br>
used for clarifying suspensions of organic matter of a<br>
proteinaceous or cellulosic nature such as those found in<br>
sewage and industrial plant treatment effluents or in<br>
paper mills.<br>
These suspended materials are hydrophilic in nature<br>
and often have specific gravities quite close to the<br>
aqueous liquors in which they are suspended, and differ<br>
in a marked way with more hydrophobic mineral suspensions<br>
in that they are frequently much more difficult to<br>
flocculate economically with chemical reagents prior to a<br>
physical dewatering step such as filtration, flotation,<br>
sedimentation or dewatering.  These difficulties are<br>
particularly noticeable when higher proportions of<br>
suspended matter are present, commonly involving<br>
concentrations of 0.5 percent by weight and upwards where<br>
the suspensions take on a paste-like consistency and are<br>
commonly described as sludges.<br>
It is well known that the clarification or<br>
dewatering of sewage and industrial sludges and similar<br>
organic suspensions may be aided by chemical reagents,<br>
added in order to induce a state of coagulation or<br>
flocculation which facilitates the process of<br>
solid/liquid or liquid/liquid separation from water.  For<br>
this purpose, lime or salts of iron or aluminum have been<br>
utilized. More recently synthetic polyelectrolytes,<br>
particularly certain cationic and anionic copolymers of<br>
acrylamide, have been found to be of interest.<br>
While strictly mechanical means have been used to<br>
effect solids/liquid separation, modern methods often<br>
rely on mechanical separation techniques that are<br>
augmented by synthetic and natural polymeric materials to<br>
accelerate the rate at which solids can be removed from<br>
water.  These processes include the treatment of raw<br>
water with cationic coagulant polymers that settle<br>
suspended inorganic particulates and make the water<br>
usable for industrial or municipal purposes.  Other<br>
examples of these processes include the removal of<br>
colored soluble species from paper mill effluent wastes<br>
and the use of polymeric flocculants for the treatment of<br>
industrial water, as sludge conditioners for the<br>
treatment of municipal water systems, as retention and<br>
drainage aids in the manufacture of paper, as chemicals<br>
for recovering useful and valuable substances from white<br>
water in the papermaking process and in emulsion<br>
breaking.<br>
A benchmark test for evaluating the effectiveness of<br>
a flocculant is the so-called drainage test in which the<br>
polymer is added to sludge and mixed so that the polymer<br>
flocculates the sludge.  The mixture is then poured<br>
through a belt filter press cloth and the rate at which<br>
water drains is taken as a measure of polymer<br>
performance.<br>
Regarding the mechanism of separation processes,<br>
particles in nature have either a cationic or anionic<br>
charge.  Accordingly, these particles often are removed<br>
by a water-soluble coagulant or flocculant polymer having<br>
a charge opposite to that of the particles.  This is<br>
referred to as a polyelectrolyte enhanced solids/liquid<br>
separation process, wherein a water-soluble or<br>
dispersible ionically charged polymer is added to<br>
neutralize the charged particles or emulsion droplets to<br>
be separated.  The dosage of these polymers is critical<br>
to the performance of the process.  Too little ionically<br>
charged polymer, and the suspended particles will not be<br>
charge neutralized and will thus still repel each other.<br>
Too much polymer, and the polymer will be wasted, or<br>
worse, present a problem in and of itself.<br>
Notwithstanding the variety of commercially<br>
available polymers that have been found to be capable of<br>
flocculating or coagulating sludges, there are various<br>
circumstances which tend to limit the usefulness of these<br>
reagents.  While for certain sludges economical<br>
treatments with these known reagents are feasible, more<br>
often sludges require very high and cost-ineffective<br>
dosages of reagents for successful treatment.  Moreover,<br>
variations often occur in sludge from any one source.<br>
For example, variations in the supply of material to the<br>
waste water/sludge/paper furnish process water and/or in<br>
the oxidizing conditions that may be involved in the<br>
production of these waters lead to a variety of particle<br>
types which must be removed.  Furthermore, it is not<br>
uncommon to encounter sludges that are, for some reason,<br>
not amenable to flocculation by any of the known<br>
polymeric flocculating agents.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for an improved family of<br>
polymers that provide better drainage at lower doses in<br>
sludge dewatering.  Likewise, there is a continuing need<br>
for treatments to increase the efficiency of pulp and<br>
paper manufacture.<br>
EP 202,780 discloses particulate cross-linked<br>
copolymers of acrylamide with at least 5 mole percent<br>
dialkylaminoalkyl acrylate for use as flocculants in<br>
high-shear applications.<br>
The addition of a cross-linking agent both at the<br>
beginning, and during the polymerization process under<br>
conditions such that its availability for reaction is<br>
substantially constant throughout the process is<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,950,725.<br>
EP 374,458 discloses water-soluble branched high<br>
molecular weight cationic flocculants formed from<br>
monomers polymerized in the presence of chain transfer<br>
agents such as isopropanol and branching agents such as<br>
methylene bisacrylamide, in which the chain transfer<br>
agent is added to prevent cross linking.  Cross linking<br>
can render the polymer insoluble in water.<br>
Addition of chain transfer agent at the conclusion<br>
of polymerization of a DADMAC/acrylamide copolymer to<br>
produce a linear higher molecular weight copolymer is<br>

quaternary salt copolymers and bentonite as additives in<br>
pulp or paper manufacture.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,393,381 discloses use of a<br>
branched cationic polyacrylamide powder such as an<br>
acrylamide/dimethylaminoethyl acrylate quaternary salt<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
We have discovered that the late stage addition to a<br>
polymerization reaction of a structural modifier as<br>
described herein results in formation of a more<br>
effective, structurally-modified flocculant.  When the<br>
structural modifier is a chain-transfer agent, the<br>
resulting water-soluble polymers typically have a faster<br>
rate of solubilization, higher reduced specific<br>
viscosities and are more active than unmodified analogs.<br>
This is applicable to cationic, anionic, or nonionic<br>
polymers, synthesized using water-in-oil emulsion,<br>
dispersion, or gel polymerization techniques.<br>
Accordingly, in its principal aspect, this invention<br>
is directed to a water-soluble polymer prepared by<br>
initiating polymerization of an aqueous solution of<br>
monomers under free radical polymerization conditions to<br>
form a polymer solution and adding at least one<br>
structural modifier to the polymer solution after at<br>
least 3 0% polymerization of the monomers has occurred.<br>

"RSV" stands for Reduced Specific Viscosity. Within a series of<br>
polymer homologs which are  substantially linear and well<br>

for dilute polymer solutions  are an indication of polymer<br>
chain length and average molecular weight  according to<br>
Paul J.   Flory,   in "Principles of Polymer Chemistry",<br>
Cornell University Press,   Ithaca,   NY.,   ©  1953,   Chapter<br>
VII,   "Determination of Molecular Weights",   pp.   266-316.<br>
The RSV is measured at a given polymer concentration and<br>
temperature and calculated as follows:<br><br>
The units of concentration "c" are (grams/100 ml or<br>
g/deciliter).  Therefore, the units of RSV are dl/g.  In<br>
this patent application, a 1.0 molar sodium nitrate<br>
solution is used for measuring RSV, unless specified.<br>
The polymer concentration in this solvent is 0.045 g/dl.<br>
The RSV is measured at 30 °C.  The viscosities η  and ΗΟ<br>
are measured using a Cannon Ubbelohde semimicro dilution<br>
viscometer, size 75.  The viscometer is mounted in a<br>
perfectly vertical position in a constant temperature<br>
bath adjusted to 30 ± 0.02 °C.  The error inherent in the<br>
calculation of RSV is about 2 dl/grams.  When two polymer<br>
homologs within a series have similar RSV s that is an<br>
indication that they have similar molecular weights.<br>
"IV" stands for intrinsic viscosity, which is RSV<br>
extrapolated to the limit of infinite dilution, infinite<br>
dilution being when the concentration of polymer is equal<br>
to zero.<br>
"Based on formula" means the amount of reagent added<br>
based on the total formula weight.<br>
"Based on polymer active" and "based on monomer"<br>
mean the amount of a reagent added based on the level of<br>
vinylic monomer in the formula, or the level of polymer<br>
formed after polymerization, assuming 100% conversion.<br>
"Raw water" means water from natural geographical<br>
sources including rivers, lakes, well water, rain water,<br>
and the like.<br>
"Process water" means water used in a process such<br>
as a manufacturing process (paper machine), steel<br>
production, chemical production processes, refinery-<br>
processes, food production processes (i.e., sugar<br>
process), and the like.<br>
"Waste water" means water from a manufacturing<br>
process, municipal waste or other waters which are<br>
required to be treated prior to discharge to a receiving<br>
stream, lake or other water way.<br>
"Papermaking process" means a method of making paper<br>
products from pulp comprising forming an aqueous<br>
cellulosic papermaking furnish, draining the furnish to<br>
form a sheet and drying the sheet.  The steps of forming<br>
the papermaking furnish, draining and drying may be<br>
carried out in any conventional manner generally known to<br>
those skilled in the art.  Conventional coagulants,<br>
conventional flocculants, microparticles, alum, cationic<br>
starch or a combination thereof may be utilized as<br>
adjuncts with the structurally-modified water-soluble<br>
polymer of this invention, though it must be emphasized<br>
that no adjunct is required for effective retention and<br>
drainage activity.<br>
"Monomer" means a polymerizable allylic, vinylic or<br>
acrylic compound.  The monomer may be anionic, cationic<br>
or nonionic.  Vinyl monomers are preferred, acrylic<br>

"Chain transfer agent" means any molecule, used in<br>
free-radical polymerization, which will react with a<br>

In particular, adding a chain transfer agent to a<br>
polymerizing mixture results in a chain-breaking and a<br>
concommitant decrease in the size of the polymerizing<br>

Additive in Free Radical  Polymerization,"  Section II, pp.<br>
81-151, in "Polymer Handbook,"  edited by J. Brandrup and<br>

monomer or monomers results in "cross-linked" polymers in<br>
which a branch or branches from one polymer molecule<br>

Preferred Embodiments<br>
The water-soluble modified polymers prepared as<br>
describe herein may be cationic, anionic or non-ionic.<br>
They may be emulsion polymers, dispersion polymers, or<br>
gel polymers.<br>
"Emulsion polymer" and "latex polymer" mean a water-<br>
in-oil polymer emulsion comprising a cationic, anionic or<br>
nonionic polymer according to this invention in the<br>
aqueous phase, a hydrocarbon oil for the oil phase and a<br>
water-in-oil emulsifying agent.  Inverse emulsion<br>
polymers are hydrocarbon continuous with the water-<br>
soluble polymers dispersed within the hydrocarbon matrix.<br>
The inverse emulsion polymers are then "inverted" or<br>
activated for use by releasing the polymer from the<br>
particles using shear, dilution, and, generally, another<br>
surfactant.  See U.S. Pat. No. 3,734,873, incorporated<br>
herein by reference.  Representative preparations of high<br>
molecular weight inverse emulsion polymers are described<br>
U. S. Patent nos. 2,982,749/ 3,284,393/ and 3,734,873.<br>

Inverse-Microsuspension Homopolymerization of<br>
Acrylamide," Hunkeler, et al., Polymer (1989), 30(1),<br>

Microsuspension Polymerization: 2. Copolymerization of<br>
Acrylamide with Quaternary Ammonium Cationic Monomers,"<br>

The aqueous phase is prepared by mixing together in<br>
water one or more water-soluble monomers, and any<br>
polymerization additives such as inorganic salts,<br>
chelants, pH buffers, and the like.<br>
The oil phase is prepared by mixing together an<br>
inert hydrocarbon liquid with one or more oil soluble<br>
surfactants.  The surfactant mixture should have a low<br>
HLB, to ensure the formation of an oil continuous<br>
emulsion.  Appropriate surfactants for water-in-oil<br>
emulsion polymerizations, which are commercially<br>
available, are compiled in the North American Edition of<br>
McCutcheon's Emulsifiers &amp; Detergents.  The oil phase may<br>
need to be heated to ensure the formation of a<br>
homogeneous oil solution.<br>
The oil phase is then charged into a reactor<br>
equipped with a mixer, a thermocouple, a nitrogen purge<br>
tube, and a condenser.  The aqueous phase is added to the<br>
reactor containing the oil phase with vigorous stirring<br>
to form an emulsion.  The resulting emulsion is heated to<br>
the desired temperature, purged with nitrogen, and a<br>
free-radical initiator is added.  The reaction mixture is<br>
stirred for several hours under a nitrogen atmosphere at<br>
the desired temperature. Upon completion of the<br>
reaction, the water-in-oil emulsion polymer is cooled to<br>
room temperature, where any desired post-polymerization<br>
additives, such as antioxidants, or a high HLB surfactant<br>
(as described in U.S. Patent 3,734,873) may be added.<br>
The resulting emulsion polymer is a free-flowing<br>
liquid.  An aqueous solution of the water-in-oil emulsion<br>
polymer can be generated by adding a desired amount of<br>
the emulsion polymer to water with vigorous mixing in the<br>
presence of a high-HLB surfactant (as described in U.S.<br>
Patent 3,734,873).<br>
"Dispersion polymer" means a dispersion of fine<br>
particles of polymer in an aqueous salt solution which is<br>
prepared by polymerizing monomers with stirring in an<br>
aqueous salt solution in which the resulting polymer is<br>
insoluble.  See U.S. Pat. nos. 5,708,071; 4,929,655;<br>
5,006,590; 5,597,859; 5,597,858 and European Patent nos.<br>
657,478 and 630,909.<br>
In a typical procedure for preparing a dispersion<br>
polymer, an aqueous solution containing one or more<br>
inorganic or hydrophobic salts, one or more water-soluble<br>
monomers, any polymerization additives such as processing<br>
aids, chelants, pH buffers and a water-soluble stabilizer<br>
polymer is charged to a reactor equipped with a mixer, a<br>
thermocouple, a nitrogen purging tube, and a water<br>
condenser.  The monomer solution is mixed vigorously,<br>
heated to the desired temperature, and then a water-<br>
soluble initiator is added.  The solution is purged with<br>
nitrogen while maintaining temperature and mixing for<br>
several hours.  After this time, the mixture is cooled to<br>
room temperature, and any post-polymerization additives<br>
are charged to the reactor.  Water continuous dispersions<br>
of water-soluble polymers are free flowing liquids with<br>
product viscosities generally 100-10,000 cP, measured at<br>
low shear.<br>
In a typical procedure for preparing gel polymers,<br>
an aqueous solution containing one or more water-soluble<br>
monomers and any additional polymerization additives such<br>
as chelants, pH buffers, and the like, is prepared.  This<br>
mixture is charged to a reactor equipped with a mixer, a<br>
thermocouple, a nitrogen purging tube and a water<br>
condenser.  The solution is mixed vigorously, heated to<br>
the desired temperature, and then one or more water-<br>
soluble free radical polymerization initiators are added.<br>
The solution is purged with nitrogen while maintaining<br>
temperature and mixing for several hours.  Typically, the<br>
viscosity of the solution increases during this period.<br>
After the polymerization is complete, the reactor<br>
contents are cooled to room temperature and then<br>
transferred to storage.  Gel polymer viscosities vary<br>
widely, and are dependent upon the concentration and<br>
molecular weight of the active polymer component.<br>
The polymerization reactions described herein are<br>
initiated by any means which results in generation of a<br>
suitable free-radical.  Thermally derived radicals, in<br>
which the radical species results from thermal, homolytic<br>
dissociation of an azo, peroxide, hydroperoxide and<br>
perester compound are preferred.  Especially preferred<br>
initiators are azo compounds including 2,2'-azobis(2-<br>
amidinopropane) dihydrochloride, 2,2'-azobis[2-(2-<br>
imidazolin-2-yl)propane] dihydrochloride, 2,2'-<br>
azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN), 2,2'-azobis(2,4-<br>
dimethylvaleronitrile) (AIVN) , and the like.<br>
The polymerization conditions utilized herein are<br>
selected such that the resulting water-soluble<br>
structurally-modified polymer has a molecular weight of 2<br>
million to 30 million and an intrinsic viscosity above 1,<br>
more preferably above 6 and still more preferably 15 to<br>
30 dl/g.  The reduced specific viscosity of the water-<br>
soluble structurally-modified polymer is generally above<br>
3, preferably above 12 and frequently above 24 dl/g.<br>
The structural modifiers are added to the reaction<br>
mixture after the start of polymerization of the monomers<br>
and prior to completion of polymerization of the<br>
monomers.  They may be added all at once as a single<br>
treatment, or in portions.  The level of modifier added<br>
to the aqueous polymer solution depends on the efficiency<br>
of the structural modifier, the polymer concentration,<br>
and the degree of polymerization at which it is added.<br>
The degree of polymerization of monomers is<br>
determined by the change in the reaction density for<br>
water-in-oil emulsion polymerization, calorimeterically<br>
by measuring the heat of reaction, by quantitative<br>
infrared spectroscopy, or chromatographically, by<br>
measuring the level of unreacted monomer.<br>
When a chain-transfer agent is the structural<br>
modifying agent, the chain-transfer agent may be added<br>
all at once as a single treatment, in portions, or in a<br>
manner such that the rate of addition parallels polymer<br>
conversion.  In one embodiment, addition may be as a<br>
single treatment added after about 30%, preferably after<br>
about 50% polymerization of the monomers.  The level of<br>
chain-transfer agent added is generally between from<br>
about 1 to about 30,000 ppm, preferably from about 2 5 to<br>
about 10,000 ppm and more preferably from about 50 to<br>
about 2,000 ppm based on monomer.  When the chain-<br>
transfer agent is sodium hypophosphite, the level added<br>
is generally from about 2 to about 2000 ppm, preferably<br>
from about 100 to about 1000 ppm.<br>
When the structural modifier is a cross-linking<br>
agent, the cross-linking agent is added after about 30%,<br>
preferably after about 50% polymerization of the<br>
monomers.  The level of cross-linking agent is generally<br>
from about 0.1 to about 500 ppm, preferably from about 1<br>
to about 50 ppm based on monomer.  When the cross-linking<br>
agent is methylenebisacrylamide, the level is generally<br>
from about 0.5 to about 50 ppm, preferably from about 1<br>
to about 10 ppm based on monomer.<br>
When the cross-linker is a vinyltrialkoxysilane, the<br>
level of cross-linker is generally from about 0.1 to<br>
about 30,000 ppm, preferably from about 0.5 to about<br>
15,000 ppm, more preferably from about 1 to about 3,000<br>
ppm based on monomer. The vinyltrialkoxysilane may be<br>
added all at once as a single treatment, or in portions<br>
after the polymerization of the monomers has started,<br>
preferably after about 3 0 percent of the monomers have<br>
polymerized.<br>
When the structural modifier is a combination of a<br>
cross-linker and a chain transfer agent, the amounts of<br>
each may vary widely based on the chain-transfer constant<br>
"efficiency" of the chain-transfer agent, the<br>
multiplicity and "efficiency" of the cross-linking agent,<br>
and the point during the polymerization where it is<br>
added.  For example from about 1,000 to about 5,000 ppm<br>
(based on monomer) of a moderate chain transfer agent<br>
such as isopropyl alcohol may be suitable while much<br>
lower amounts, typically from about 100 to about 500 ppm,<br>
of more effective chain transfer agents such as<br>
mercaptoethanol are useful.  Representative combinations<br>
of cross-linkers and chain transfer agents contain from<br>
about 1 to about 30,000 ppm, preferably from about 25 to<br>
about 10,000 and more preferably from about 300 to about<br>
1500 ppm (based on monomer) of chain transfer agent and<br>
from about 1 to about 500, preferably from about 2 to<br>
about 100 and more preferably from about 5 to about 50<br>
ppm (based on monomer) of cross-linker.  A preferred<br>
combination of cross-linker and chain transfer agent is<br>
methylenebisacrylamide and formic acid and its salts,<br>
preferably sodium formate.<br>
Where the structural modifier is a cross-linking<br>
agent, polymers formed by the addition of a cross-linking<br>
agent to the polymerization generally between 30% and 99%<br>
conversion, preferably between 50 and 90% conversion, and<br>
frequently between 65 and 85% conversion, are more active<br>
than the unmodified polymers which are substantially<br>
linear, cross-linked, water-insoluble particles disclosed<br>
in US 4,950,725 and EP 202,780 and the highly branched,<br>
water-soluble polymers disclosed in US 5,94 5,494.<br>
The polymers modified with a cross-linking agent<br>
after the start of polymerization differ from the<br>
particulate polymer flocculants disclosed in US 4,950,725<br>
and EP 202.780 that are swellable, but, insoluble in<br>
water.  These particles are formed either through the<br>
addition of a water-soluble cross-linking agent, or a<br>
mixture of different cross-linking reagents with<br>
different reactivities, usually polyethylenically<br>
unsaturated monomers at the front-end, or alternatively<br>
both at the beginning of the process and at or near the<br>
end of the process such that the availability of the<br>
cross-linker is substantially constant throughout the<br>
reaction or by cross-linking preformed water-soluble<br>
polymers.  Polymers modified with a cross-linking agent<br>
as described herein are not particulate in aqueous<br>
solution.<br>
The polymers of this invention also differ from<br>
polymers disclosed in US 5,945,494, which are water-<br>
soluble, highly branched species.  Essential to the<br>
formation of these polymers is the inclusion of a<br>
molecular weight modifying, or chain-transfer agent in<br>
combination with high levels of a branching agent (4 to<br>
80 ppm, based on initial molar content) to form highly-<br>
branched, water-soluble polymers.  As stated in US<br>
5,945,494 column 5, lines 35-38, in the absence of a<br>
chain-transfer agent, the incorporation of even extremely<br>
small amounts of branching agent, e.g. 5 parts per<br>
million may cause crosslinking, rendering the polymer<br>
insoluble in water.  The combination of a branching agent<br>
and a molecular weight modifying agent included in the<br>
aqueous monomer solution at the start of reaction as<br>
disclosed in US 5,945,494, will yield highly branched<br>
polymers with polymer chains of limited molecular weight.<br>
It is believed that polymers modified with a cross-<br>
linking agent after the start of polymerization described<br>
herein contain a mixture of linear high molecular weight<br>
polymer formed during the initial part of the reaction,<br>
and long-chain branched polymer formed during the latter<br>
part of the reaction.  For aqueous solutions made-up from<br>
polymers modified using late addition of a cross-linking<br>
agent, it is possible that water-soluble, non-<br>
particulate, aggregates of several entangled polymer<br>
chains exist.  Macromolecular entanglements have been<br>
proposed for high molecular weight polymers, formed by<br>
free-radical polymerization methods (Gardner, et. al., J.<br>

Chemistry, 32(2), 655, (1996).<br>

POLYMERS MODIFIED BY LATE ADDITION OF CROSS LINKING<br>
AGENTS<br>
Example 1<br>
Polymer 1, a control polymer of 15% polymer solids,<br>
90/10 mole percent AcAm/DMAEA•BCQ dispersion is<br>
synthesized in the following manner:<br>
To a 1500 ml reaction flask fitted with a mechanical<br>
stirrer, thermocouple, condenser, nitrogen purge tube and<br>
addition port is added 213 g of a 49.6% aqueous solution<br>
of acrylamide (Nalco Chemical Company, Naperville, IL),<br>
56.6 g of dimethylaminoethylacrylate benzyl chloride<br>
quaternary salt (70.9% aqueous solution, Nalco Chemical<br>
Company, Naperville, IL) , 9 g of glycerin, 59 g of the<br>
copolymer of dimethylaminoethylacrylate benzyl chloride<br>
quaternary salt and diallyldimethylammonium chloride (15%<br>
aqueous solution, Nalco Chemical Company, Naperville,<br>
IL), 0.4 g of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid,<br>
tetrasodium salt, 157 g of ammonium sulfate and 424 g of<br>
deionized water.  The mixture is then heated to 48 °C<br>
while stirring at 900 rpm.  After reaching 48 °C, 1.2 g<br>
of a 1.0% aqueous solution of 2,2'-azobis(2-<br>
amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (V-50, Wako Chemicals,<br>
Dallas, TX) is added to the reaction mixture, the system<br>
is purged with nitrogen and the temperature is maintained<br>
at 48 °C.  Two hours after initiation, 3.8 g of a 1.0%<br>
aqueous solution of 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane)<br>
dihydrochloride is added to the reaction and at three<br>
hours after initiation 6.0 g of<br>
dimethylaminoethylacrylate benzyl chloride quaternary<br>
salt and at four hours 4 g of a 10% aqueous solution of<br>
2, 2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride is added.<br>
At six hours the reaction is cooled to ambient<br>
temperature and 55.0 g of sodium sulfate, 10.0 g sodium<br>
thiosulfate, and 10.0 g acetic acid are added.  The<br>
resulting product is a smooth milky white dispersion with<br>
a bulk viscosity of 30 cP (centipoise) and a reduced<br>
specific viscosity of 17.8 dl/g (0.045% polymer in 0.125<br>
N NaNO3 solution at 30 °C).<br>
Example 2<br>
Polymer 2, a vinyltrimethoxysilane modified 15%<br>
polymer solids, 90/10 mole percent AcAm/DMAEA•BCQ<br>
dispersion polymer is synthesized using the general<br>
procedure described in Example 1.  The standard method is<br>
modified by adding 0.25 g vinyltrimethoxysilane (Huls<br>
America, Inc., Bristol, PA) to the reaction mixture at<br>
3.5 hours after initiation (approximately 88%<br>
conversion).  No further modifications are made.  The<br>
reduced specific viscosity of the product is 18.3 dl/g<br>
(0.045% polymer in 0.125 N NaNO3 solution at 30°C).<br>
Example 3<br>
Polymer 3, a vinyltrimethoxysilane modified 15%<br>
polymer solids, 90/10 mole percent AcAm/DMAEA•BCQ<br>
dispersion is synthesized using the general procedure<br>
described in Example 1.  The standard method is modified<br>
by addition of 0.10 g vinyltrimethoxysilane (Huls<br>
America, Inc. Bristol, PA) to the reaction mixture at 3<br>
hours after initiation (approximately 86% conversion).<br>
No further modifications are made.  The resulting product<br>
is a smooth milky white dispersion has a bulk viscosity<br>
of 30 cP and a reduced specific viscosity of 16 dl/g<br>
(0.045* polymer in 0.125 N NaNO3 solution at 30 °C).<br>
Example 4<br>
Polymer 4, a VTMS modified 15% solids, 90/10 mole<br>
percent AcAm/DMAEA•MCQ is synthesized using the following<br>
procedure.<br>
To a 1500 ml resin flask equipped with a stirrer,<br>
temperature controller, nitrogen sparge tube and water<br>
condenser is added 335.2 g of deionized water, 230.3 g of<br>
a 48.6% aqueous solution of acrylamide (Nalco Chemical<br>
Co., Naperville, IL), 43.6g of dimethlyaminoethylacrylate<br>
methyl chloride quaternary salt (DMAEA •MCQ, 80%, NCF<br>
Manufacturing, Riceboro, GA), 50.0 g of a 15% solution of<br>
poly(dimethlaminoethylmethacrylate methyl chloride<br>
quaternary salt, Nalco Chemical Co., Naperville, IL), 5.0<br>
g of adipic acid, 13.5 g of glycerol, 0.42 g of EDTA•4Na+<br>
and 302.0 g ammonium sulfate.  The mixture is heated to<br>
48 °C and 1.0 g of a 1% solution of V-50 is added.  The<br>
resulting solution is sparged with nitrogen at the rate<br>
of 1000 ml/min.  After 15 minutes, polymerization begins<br>
and the solution becomes viscous.  Over the next four<br>
hours, the temperature is maintained at 4 8 °C.  After 3.0<br>
hours of polymerization, an additional 2.0 g of a 1%<br>
solution of V-50 is added to the reaction mixture.  After<br>
3.5 hours of polymerization (approximately 80%<br>
conversion), 0.25 g of vinyltrimethoxysilane is added to<br>
the reaction mixture.  At four hours after initiation,<br>
4.0 g of a 10% solution of V-50 is added to the<br>
dispersion and the reaction is allowed to continue for<br>
another 4 hours.  After this time, the dispersion is<br>
cooled to room temperature, and 5.0 g of adipic acid and<br>
10.0 g of sodium thiosulfate is added.  The polymer<br>
product has a Brookfield viscosity of 150 cP (#3 spindle,<br>
12 rpm) and a reduced specific viscosity of 18 dl/g at<br>
450 ppm in 1 N NaNO3.<br>
Example 5<br>
Polymer 5, a 21% polymer solids, 70/3 0 mole percent<br>
acrylamide/diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride VTMS-<br>
modified dispersion polymer was synthesized in the<br>
following manner.<br>
To a 1500 ml reaction flask fitted with a mechanical<br>
stirrer, thermocouple, condenser, nitrogen purge tube,<br>
and addition port is added 28.0 g of a 49.4% aqueous<br>
solution of acrylamide (Nalco Chemical Company,<br>
Naperville, IL), 175.0 g of a 63% aqueous solution of<br>
diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride (Nalco Chemical<br>
Company,  Naperville, IL) , 44.0 g of a 15% aqueous<br>
solution of a homopolymer of dimethylaminoethyl acrylate<br>

Naperville, IL), 0.66 g of sodium formate, 0.44 g of<br>
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, tetra sodium salt, 220.0<br>
g of ammonium sulfate, 44.0 g sodium sulfate, 0.20 g<br>
polysilane antifoam (Nalco Chemical Company, Naperville,<br>
IL) , and 332.0 g of deionized water.  The resulting<br>
mixture is heated to 42 °C and is stirred at 700 rpm.<br>
Upon reaching 42 °C, 5.0 g of a 10.0% aqueous solution of<br>
2,2'-azobis[2-(2-imidazolin-2-yl)propane] dihydrochloride<br>
(VA-044, Wako Chemicals, Dallas, TX) is added to the<br>
reaction mixture and a nitrogen purge started.  Forty-<br>
five minutes after initiator addition, 194.7 g of a 49.4%<br>
aqueous solution of acrylamide is added to the reaction<br>
mixture over a period of 6 hours.  At 4.5 hours after<br>
initiator addition (-80% acrylamide conversion based on<br>
total monomer), 0.26 g of vinyltrimethoxysilane (Huls<br>
America, Inc., Bristol, PA) is added to the reaction. At<br>
8 hours after the initiator addition, the reaction<br>
mixture is cooled to ambient temperature.  The product is<br>
a smooth milky white dispersion with a bulk viscosity of<br>
520 cP and a reduced specific viscosity of 4.5 dl/g<br>
(0.045% solution of the polymer in 1.0 N aqueous sodium<br>
nitrate at 30 °C).<br>

in Example 5, except that the vinyltrimethoxysilane is<br>
added to the reaction 5.5 hours after initiator addition<br>
(~90% acrylamide conversion based on total monomer).  The<br>
product is a smooth milky white dispersion with a bulk<br>

Example 7<br>
Three experimental techniques are utilized to assess<br>
the utility of the structurally-modified polymers in<br>
papermaking applications.  These techniques are detailed<br>
below.  For the first two techniques, a synthetic<br>
alkaline paper furnish is utilized.<br>
The alkaline furnish has a pH of 8.1 and is composed<br>
of 80 weight percent cellulosic fiber and 20 weight<br>
percent filler diluted to an overall consistency of 0.5%<br>
by weight using synthetic formulation water.  The<br>
cellulosic fiber consists of 60% by weight bleached<br>
hardwood kraft and 4 0% by weight bleached softwood kraft.<br>
The filler is a commercial ground calcium carbonate<br>
provided in dry form.  The formulation water contains 200<br>
ppm calcium hardness (added as CaCl2) , 152 ppm magnesium<br>
hardness (added as MgSO4), and 110 ppm bicarbonate<br>
alkalinity (added as NaHC03) .<br>
Britt Jar Test<br>
The Britt Jar Test uses a Britt CF Dynamic Drainage<br>
Jar developed by K. W. Britt of New York University,<br>
which generally consists of an upper chamber of about 1<br>
liter capacity and a bottom drainage chamber, the<br>
chambers being separated by a support screen and a<br>
drainage screen (typically 200 mesh or 76 μm opening).<br>
Below the drainage chamber is a flexible tube extending<br>
downward equipped with a clamp for closure.  The upper<br>
chamber is provided with a 2-inch, 3-blade propeller to<br>
create controlled shear conditions in the upper chamber.<br>
The test is performed according to the following<br>
sequence:<br><br>
Where the beneficial effect of microparticles on<br>
polymer performance is evaluated, the following sequence<br>
is used:<br><br>
The starch used is Solvitose N, a cationic potato<br>
starch, commercially available from Nalco Chemical<br>
Company, Naperville, IL.  The material drained from the<br>
Britt Jar (the '"filtrate") is collected and diluted with<br>
water to provide a turbidity which can be measured<br>
conveniently.  The turbidity of such diluted filtrate is<br>
then determined in Nephelometric or Formazine Turbidity<br>
Units (NTU or FTU).  The turbidity of the filtrate is<br>
inversely proportional to the papermaking retention<br>
performance; the lower the turbidity value (or higher the<br>
turbidity reduction), the higher is the retention of<br>
filler and/or fines.  Therefore the lower the turbidity,<br>
the more efficient the flocculant.  The turbidity values<br>
are determined using a Hach Turbidimeter.<br>
Filler retention for the synthetic alkaline furnish<br>
o<br>
is also determined by gravimetric analysis (500 - 550 C)<br>
of the filtrate collected.<br>
Focused Beam Reflectance Measurement (FBRM)<br>
The size of flocs formed (evaluated by determining<br>
changes in the mean chord length) for the synthetic<br>
alkaline furnish are measured in-situ  using a Focused<br>
Beam Reflectance (FBRM) instrument to measure peak mean<br>
chord length.  The FBRM employed in the following<br>
examples is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,871,251 and<br>
Alfano, et al., Nordic Pulp and Paper Research Journal,<br>
13, (2) , 159 (1998), and generally consists of a laser<br>
source, optics to deliver the incident light to and<br>
retrieve the scattered light from the furnish, a<br>
photodiode, and signal analysis hardware.  Commercial<br>
instruments (Model # M100 or M500) are available from<br>
Lasentec™, Redmond, Washington.<br>
The experiment consists of taking 300 ml of the<br>
desired paper furnish and placing this in the appropriate<br>
mixing beaker.  Shear is provided to the furnish via a<br>
variable speed motor and propeller.  The propeller is set<br>
at a fixed distance from the probe window to ensure<br>
slurry movement across the window.  The change in mean<br>
chord length of the the furnish relates to papermaking<br>
retention performance; the greater the change induced by<br>
the treatment, the higher the retention value.  Therefore<br>
a larger mean chord length number means that the<br>
flocculant is more efficient.  A typical dosing sequence<br>
is shown below.<br><br>
Dissolved Air Flotation Test (DAF)<br>
Samples of dissolved air flotation (DAF) influent<br>
are obtained from a Southern United States newsprint<br>
deinking mill.  Typical jar tests are used to monitor<br>
polymer performance.  Samples of the deinking influent<br>
are stirred at 200 rpm (fast mix) for 3 minutes. A<br>
coagulant (alum) is added at the beginning of fast mix<br>
and the flocculant during the last 40 seconds of the fast<br>
mix.  This is followed by a slow mix at 25 rpm for 2<br>
minutes.  The samples are allowed to settle for 5 minutes<br>
and an aliquot of the upper liquid layer is removed.  The<br>
turbidity of these aliquots is determined with a HACH<br>
DR2000 at 450 nm.  The lower the turbidity, the more<br>
efficient the flocculant.<br>
The Britt Jar test described above is utilized to<br>
obtain the results of Tables 2-4.  In all examples, a<br>
greater turbidity reduction resulted from use of VTMS-<br>
modified dispersion polymer flocculants than with the<br>
equivalent dispersion polymer flocculants which are not<br>
modified.<br>

The Dissolved Air Flotation test (DAF) is utilized<br>
to obtain the results of Table 5.  In the tests, the VTMS<br>
modified dispersion polymer flocculant provided greater<br>
turbidity reduction than the equivalent unmodified<br>
polymer flocculant.<br>

The foregoing results demonstrates that a modified<br>
polymer shows improved performance over that of an<br>
unmodified polymer having comparable solution properties.<br>
Example 8<br>
AcAm/DMAEA•MCQ (9:1) inverse emulsion polymers<br>
modified with MBA at different conversions are<br>
synthesized in the following manner:<br>
An aqueous monomer phase is made-up by stirring<br>
together 364.37 g of a 49.6% aqueous solution of<br>
acrylamide (AcAm, Nalco Chemical Co., Naperville, IL),<br>
178.33 g of water, 9.00 g of adipic acid, 27.00 g of<br>
NaCl, and 0.80 g of a 50% aqueous solution of NaOH.  The<br>
components are stirred until dissolved.  To the resulting<br>
solution is added 67.90 g of a 80.3% solution of<br>
dimethylaminoethylacrylate methyl chloride quaternary<br>
salt (DMAEA •MCQ, CPS Chemical Co.; Old Bridge, NJ) and<br>
0.09 g of EDTA•4Na+ (ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid,<br>
tetra sodium salt, Van Waters &amp; Rogers, Geismar, LA).<br>
The pH of the resulting mixture is 3.9.<br>
An oil phase is prepared by heating a mixture of<br>
234.29 g of paraffinic oil (Isopar M, Exxon, Houston,<br>
TX), 13.50 g of Span-80 and 4.50 g of Tween-61 until the<br>
surfactants dissolve (54-57 °C).  The oil phase is<br>
charged into a 2 L reactor and heated to 45 °C.  With<br>
vigorous stirring (900 rpm, 10 mm rod with a teflon<br>
paddle at the base and 6-blade turbine mounted 3-inches<br>
from the bottom), the monomer phase is added over 2<br>
minutes.  The resulting mixture is stirred for 30<br>
minutes.<br>
To the water-in-oil emulsion is added 0.200 g of<br>
AIBN and 0.027 g of AIVN.  The polymerization is carried<br>
out under a N2 atmosphere at 45°C for 4 hours, then 70°C<br>
for one hour.  The percent conversion is estimated by<br>
density change.  A density of 0.9855 g/ml is measured for<br>
the starting emulsion, and a density of 1.0217 g/ml for<br>
the final emulsion.  At different densities of the<br>
emulsion (related to percent monomer conversion), 4.72 g<br>
of a 200 ppm solution of methylene bisacrylamide (4 ppm<br>
based on monomer, MBA, Aldrich Chemical Company,<br>
Milwaukee, WI) is added to the reaction mixture.<br>
Polymers prepared using the foregoing procedure are shown<br>
in Table 7.  Polymer 14 is representative of those<br>
polymers disclosed in EP 202,780.  For these emulsion<br>
polymers synthesized at 26 percent  actives,   the highest<br>
reduced specific viscosity is  obtained for polymers where<br>
MBA is  added at  75-85% conversion.<br>

Table 8 illustrates that when the cross-linking<br>
agent is present at the beginning of polymerization, the<br>
resulting polymers show a drop in reduced specific<br>
viscosity even at very low MBA concentrations.  In<br>
contrast to the polymers disclosed in EP 202,780, the<br>
polymers modified as described herein have a greater<br>
viscosity, which is advantageous for a flocculant.<br>
Example 9<br>
Polymers modified with MBA according to the<br>
procedure described in Example 8 are compared to polymers<br>
conventionally cross-linked.  It is known to those<br>
skilled in the art that conventionally, the cross-linker<br>
is added at the beginning of the polymerization.  We have<br>
discovered that when the cross-linker is added is of<br>
critical importance to the flocculating ability of the<br>
resultant polymer.  Tables 8-15 illustrate the surprising<br>
superiority of polymer 10, modified by late addition of<br>
cross-linker over polymer 14 that is conventionally<br>
cross-linked and polymer 9 that is unmodified.  Tables 9,<br>
10, 12, 13, 15 and 16 contain results of Britt Jar tests,<br>
and Tables 11 and 14 contain results of FBRM tests.<br>

The data in the above tables clearly show that the<br>
structurally-modified polymers are more efficient and<br>
effective retention aids than the linear controls for<br>
synthetic alkaline furnish and mill furnishes.<br>

The following two Britt Jar test experiments<br>

by late addition of cross-linkers have better retention<br>

CHAIN TRANSFER AGENT MODIFIED POLYMERS<br>
Example 11<br>
An AcAm/DMAEA•MCQ (90:10) copolymer lattice modified<br>
by late addition of sodium formate at high conversion<br>
(Polymer 18), is synthesized in the following manner.<br>
An aqueous monomer phase is made-up by stirring<br>
together 484.12 g of a 49.4% aqueous solution of<br>
acrylamide (Nalco Chemical Co., Naperville, IL) , 20.25 g<br>
of water, 9.00 g of adipic acid, 27.00 g of NaCl, and<br>
0.27 g of a 50% aqueous solution of NaOH.  The components<br>
are stirred until dissolved.  To the resulting solution<br>
is added 90.30 g of a 80.2% solution of<br>
dimethylaminoethylacrylate methyl chloride quaternary<br>
salt (DMAEA•MCQ, CPS Chemical Co.; Old Bridge, NJ) and<br>
0.18 g of EDTA•4Na+ (Van Waters &amp; Rogers, Geismar, LA) .<br>
The pH of the resulting mixture is 3.8.<br>
An oil phase is prepared by heating a mixture of<br>
243.00 g of paraffinic oil (Isopar M, Exxon, Houston,<br>
TX), 8.92 g of Span-80 and 13.58 g of Tween-61 until the<br>
surfactants dissolve (54-57 °C) .  The oil phase is<br>
charged into a 2 L reactor and heated to 45 °C.  With<br>
vigorous stirring (900 rpm, 10 mm rod with a teflon<br>
paddle at the base and 6-blade turbine mounted 3-inches<br>
from the bottom), the monomer phase is added over 2<br>
minutes.  The resulting mixture is stirred for 3 0<br>
minutes.<br>
To the water-in-oil dispersion is added 0.200 g of<br>
AIBN and 0.027g of AIVN.  The polymerization is carried<br>
out under a N2 atmosphere at 4 5 °C for 4 hours, then 70 °C<br>
for one hour.  At a conversion of 80% (estimated by<br>
density change), 8.29 g of a 38% solution of sodium<br>
formate (2000 ppm based on monomer, Van Waters &amp; Rogers,<br>
Geismar, LA) is added to the reaction mixture.  The<br>
resulting polymer has an RSV of 30.9 dl/g (1M NaNO3, 450<br>
ppm, 30°C).  An unmodified polymer polymerized without<br>
late addition of sodium formate (Polymer 19, Table 17) is<br>
synthesized in a similar manner.  These polymers are<br>
characterized in Table 17.<br>
Table 17<br>
Representative Cationic AcAm/DMAEA •MCQ Copolymers<br>
Modified Using Sodium Formate<br>
(prepared according to the method of Example 11)<br><br>
To those skilled in the art, formic acid or metal<br>
salts thereof, are known as efficient chain transfer<br>
agents to limit the molecular weight and viscosity of<br>
acrylamide based polymers (for example, U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,307,215).  It has also been reported (4,307,215 at<br>
col.l, line 54) that addition of chain transfer agent<br>
after polymerization has no effect on molecular weight.<br>
However, as shown in Tables 17, 19 and 22, we have found<br>
that adding chain transfer agents at different<br>
polymerization stages gives polymers with increased<br>
reduced specific viscosity over unmodified analogs.<br>
Tables 18 and 20 illustrate that the modified polymers<br>
are superior to the unmodified control polymers in paper<br>
retention tests.<br><br>

Example 12<br>
An AcAm/DMAEA•MCQ (90:10) copolymer lattice modified<br>
by late addition of sodium hypophosphite at high<br>
conversion (Polymer 20), is synthesized in the following<br>
manner.<br>
An aqueous monomer phase is made-up by stirring<br>
together 281.96 g of acrylamide (Mitsubishi, Japan),<br>
194.00 g of water, 9.00 g of adipic acid, 27.00 g of<br>
NaCl, and 0.27 g of a 50% aqueous solution of NaOH.  The<br>
resulting mixture is stirred for 10 minutes.  To the<br>
resulting suspension is added 107.54 g of a 79.4 %<br>
solution of dimethylaminoethylacrylate methyl chloride<br>
quaternary salt (DMAEA•MCQ, CPS Chemical Co.; Old Bridge,<br>
NJ) and 0.18 g of EDTA •4Na+ (Van Waters &amp; Rogers, Geismar,<br>
LA).  A solution is obtained by heating the suspension to<br>
35 °C while stirring for about 10 minutes.  The pH of the<br>
resulting mixture is 3.8.<br>
An oil phase is prepared by heating a mixture of<br>
252.00 g of paraffinic oil (Isopar M, Exxon, Houston,<br>
TX), 15.79 g of Span-80 and 11.21 g of Tween-61 until the<br>
surfactants dissolve (54-57 °C).  The oil phase is<br>
charged into a 2 L reactor and heated to 42 °C.  With<br>
vigorous stirring (900 rpm, 10 ram rod with a teflon<br>
paddle at the base and 6-blade turbine mounted 3-inches<br>
from the bottom) , the monomer phase is added over 2<br>
minutes.  The resulting mixture is stirred for 3 0<br>
minutes.<br>
To the water-in-oil emulsion is added 0.200 g of<br>
AIBN and 0.027 g of AIVN.  The polymerization is carried<br>
out under a N2 atmosphere at 42 °C for 2 hours.  The<br>
reaction mixture is then cooled to 35 °C, 0.85 g of a 10%<br>
aqueous solution of 2,2'-azobis[2-(2-imidazolin-2-<br>
yl)propane] dihydrochloride (VA-044, Wako Chemical Co.)<br>
is added, and the reaction continued for 19 hours. At a<br>
conversion of 75 % (estimated by density change, 100<br>
minutes), 1.84 g of a 20 % solution of sodium<br>
hypophosphite monohydrate (1000 ppm based on monomer, J.<br>
T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ) is added to the reaction<br>
mixture.  The resulting polymer has an RSV of 27.7 dl/g<br>
(1M NaNO3/ 450 ppm, 30 °C) .<br>
An unmodified polymer polymerized without late<br>
addition of sodium hypophosphite (Polymer 21) is<br>
synthesized in a similar manner, except, VA-044 is<br>
omitted from the formulation and polymerization is<br>

Example 13<br>
An AcAm/sodium acrylate (70:30) copolymer lattice<br>
modified by late addition of sodium hypophosphite at high<br>
conversion (Polymer 22), is synthesized in the following<br>
manner.<br>
An aqueous monomer phase is made-up as follows.  A<br>
50% aqueous solution of NaOH (92.0 g) is added dropwise<br>
to a cold solution of acrylamide (376.8 g of a 50.8 %<br>
aqueous solution), 166.5 g of water, and 83.0 g of<br>
glacial acrylic acid until a solution pH of 8.3 is<br>
obtained.  A 2 % solution of EDTA•4Na+ (Van Waters &amp;<br>
Rogers, Geismar, LA) is added to the resulting mixture.<br>
An oil phase is prepared by heating a mixture of<br>
252.8 g of paraffinic oil (Escaid-110), 12.2 g of Span-80<br>
and 7.3 g of Tween-61 until the surfactants dissolved<br>
(54-57 °C).  The oil phase is charged into a 2 L reactor<br>
and heated to 45 °C.  With vigorous stirring (900 rpm, 10<br>
mm rod with a teflon paddle at the base and 6-blade<br>
turbine mounted 3-inches from the bottom), the monomer<br>
phase is added over 2 minutes.  The resulting mixture is<br>
stirred for 30 minutes.<br>
To the water-in-oil emulsion is added 0.51 g of<br>
AIBN.  The polymerization is carried out under a N2<br>
atmosphere at 45 °C for 4 hours, then at 70 °C for 1<br>
hour.  At a conversion of 70 % (estimated by density<br>
change, 90 minutes), 4.0 g of a 0.5 % solution of sodium<br>
hypophosphite monohydrate (67 ppm based on monomer, J. T.<br>
Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ) is added to the reaction<br>
mixture.  The resulting polymer has an RSV of 50.7 dl/g<br>
(1M NaNO3, 4 50 ppm, 30 °C) .<br>

addition of sodium hypophosphite (Polymer 23) is<br>

of poly(acrylamidomethylpropanesulfonic acid/methacrylic<br>
acid) copolymer (Nalco Chemical Company, Naperville, IL)<br>
The pH of the resulting mixture is 4.0.  The monomer<br>
reaction solution is heated to 35 °C with thorough mixing.<br>
To the homogenous monomer reaction solution is added 1.0<br>
g of a 1 % aqueous solution of VA-044 (2,2'-Azobis (N,N'~<br>
dimethyleneisobutyramidine)dihydrochloride), Wako<br>
Chemicals USA, Inc.; Richmond, VA) .  The polymerization<br>

mixing.  After a total reaction time of 4 hours, 1.0 g of<br>
a 1 % aqueous solution of VA-044 is added to the reaction<br>
mixture.  At a monomer conversion of 80%, 0.57 g of a 10<br>
% aqueous solution of sodium hypophosphite monohydrate<br>
(250 ppm based on monomer) is added to the reaction<br>
mixture.  After a total reaction time of 8 hours, 2.0 g<br>
of a 10 % aqueous solution of VA-044 is added, and the<br>
reaction continued for another 4 hours (for a total<br>

High Shear Test for Dewatering<br>
To illustrate that polymers prepared according to<br>
the procedure of Example 17 are less efficient than the<br>
structurally-modified polymers disclosed herein, some<br>
comparative testing is done as follows.<br>
The polymer at the desired concentration is added to<br>
200 ml of sludge from a Midwestern municipal facility and<br>
mixed using the Britt Jar impeller at 1200 rpm for 1 or 2<br>
seconds depending on  the sludge.  The conditioned sludge<br>
is then poured through a belt filter press filter medium.<br>
The amount of water drained in 10 seconds is taken as a<br>
measure of the polymer performance, and a larger amount<br>
of drainage indicates better dewatering capabilities.<br>
The sludge dewatering performance of the modified<br>
polymers are compared to their unmodified counterparts in<br>
Tables 31-34.  For each example, higher drainage is<br>
obtained with the polymers modified according to the<br>
procedures described herein than with the equivalent<br>
unmodified polymer.<br><br><br>

Settling Test<br>

acrylamide/acrylic acid copolymer (70:30 mole %) modified<br>
by late addition of sodium hypophosphite (Polymer 24) and<br>
the corresponding unmodified polymer (Polymer 25) in a<br>
mining applications is done as follows.<br>
A 5-gallon sample of coal refuse slurry is stirred<br>
constantly to ensure that the slurry is well dispersed.<br>
The slurry is the: transferred to 500-ml graduated<br>
cylinders.  Masking tape is placed on each of the 500-ml<br>
cylinders adjacent to the cylinder graduation marks.  The<br>
initial level of the coal refuse slurry at time equal to<br>
zero (which is at the 500-ml mark of the graduated<br>
cylinder) is marked on the masking tape.  Prior to each<br>
test the 500 ml-cylinder containing the coal refuse<br>
slurry is inverted several times to disperse any settled<br>
solids.  The cylinder is then quickly dosed with the<br>
desired amount of a 0.12 % polymer actives solution<br>
(flocculant) and inverted 4 times.  The cylinder is then<br>
returned to the upright position and a timer is started.<br>
The position of the solids interface is monitored as a<br>
function of time (in seconds) by marking the level of the<br>
solids interface on the masking tape at the appropriate<br>
time interval.  When the rate of descent of the solid<br>
interface begins to slow down the marking of the masking<br>
tape is ended.  The settling rate (in inches/minute) of<br>
the coal refuse slurry for the free-fall region is<br>
calculated by dividing the distance of the solid<br>
interface from the initial level (in inches) by the<br>
elapsed time (in seconds).  A faster settling rate<br>
indicates better performance<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
We have discovered that the late stage addition to a<br>
polymerization reaction of a structural modifier as<br>
described herein results in formation of a more<br>
effective, structurally-modified flocculant.  When the<br>
structural modifier is a chain-transfer agent, the<br>
resulting water-soluble polymers typically have a faster<br>
rate of solubilization, higher reduced specific<br>
viscosities and are more active than unmodified analogs.<br>
This is applicable to cationic, anionic, or nonionic<br>
polymers, synthesized using water-in-oil emulsion,<br>
dispersion, or gel polymerization techniques.<br>
Accordingly, in its principal aspect, this invention<br>
is directed to a water-soluble polymer prepared by<br>
initiating polymerization of an aqueous solution of<br>
monomers under free radical polymerization conditions to<br>
form a polymer solution and adding at least one<br>
structural modifier to the polymer solution after at<br>
least 30% polymerization of the monomers has occurred.<br><br>
