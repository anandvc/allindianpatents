BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application is a continuation -in - part of provisional application<br>
60/255358 filed December 13, 2000.<br>
[0002] This application is related to U.S. Serial No. 09/(00-rTRN-348) titled:<br>
CONTROL FOR TRANSMISSION SYSTEM UTILIZING CENTRIFUGAL CLUTCH and<br>
U.S. Serial No. 09/(00-rTRN-403) titled: CENTRIFUGAL CLUTCH, both assigned to<br>
EATON CORPORATION, assignee of this invention, and both filed the same day as<br>
this application.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] The present invention relates to a centrifugal master clutch and a<br>
vehicular transmission system utilizing same. In particular, the present invention relates<br>
to an automated vehicular transmission system comprising an engine, a multiple ratio<br>
transmission, a centrifugally operated master friction clutch for drivingly coupling the<br>
engine to the transmission and a controller for controlling fueling of the engine during<br>
vehicle launch conditions, as a function of throttle position and other sensed system<br>
operating conditions such as at least one of engine speed, transmission input shaft<br>
speed, transmission output shaft speed, engine torque and engaged gear ratio.<br>
[0004] More particularly, a preferred embodiment of the present invention relates<br>
to a vehicular automated mechanical transmission system utilizing a centrifugal master<br>
friction clutch controlled solely by engine speed and a controller for controlling engine<br>
fueling during vehicle launch (i.e., start from stop) conditions on a closed loop basis to<br>
provide a target engine speed and/or engine torque.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
[0005] Automated mechanical transmission systems not requiring the vehicle<br>
driver or operator to operate the vehicle master clutch (so called "two-pedal systems"),<br>
and clutch controls and actuators therefore, are known in the prior art as may be seen<br>
by reference to U.S. Patent No."s: 4,081,065; 4,361,060; 4,936,428; 5,439,428;<br>
5,634,867; 5,630,773; 5,960,916 and; 5,947,847, the disclosures of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference. These systems are not totally satisfactory as<br>
separate clutch actuators, sensors and/or, electrical and/or fluid power (i.e.,<br>
compressed and/or hydraulic) connections thereto are required which adds to the<br>
expense of providing, assembling and maintaining such systems.<br>
[0006] Centrifugally operated friction clutches are well known in the prior art and<br>
typically include a driving input member driven by a prime mover, usually an electric<br>
motor or internal combustion engine, and weights rotatable with the driving member<br>
which, upon rotation of the driving member, will move radially outwardly under the effect<br>
of centrifugal force to cause the driving input member to frictionally engage a driven<br>
output member. Examples of centrifugally operated clutches may be seen by reference<br>
to U.S. Patent No."s: 3,580,372; 3,580,372; 3,696,901; 5,437,356; 3,810,533;<br>
4,819,779; 5,441,137; 5,730,269; and; 4,610,343, the disclosures of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0007] Fully or partially automated mechanical transmission systems that, upon<br>
determining that a dynamic shift from a currently engaged ratio into neutral and then<br>
into a target ratio is desirable, will, while maintaining the vehicle master friction clutch<br>
engaged, initiate automatic fuel control to cause reduced torque across the jaw clutches<br>
to be disengaged, are known in the prior art as may be seen by reference to U.S.<br>
Patent No."s: 4,850,236; 5,820,104; 5,582,558; 5,735,771; 5,775,639; 6,015,366; and<br>
6,126,570, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. These<br>
systems include systems that attempt to fuel the engine to achieve a sustained zero<br>
driveline torque, and systems, which force torque reversals, see U.S. Patent No.:<br>
4,850,236. These systems, upon sensing a neutral condition, will, while maintaining the<br>
master clutch engaged, cause the engine to rotate at a speed determined to cause<br>
synchronous conditions for engaging the target ratio.<br>
[0008] Vehicular driveline systems, especially for heavy-duty vehicles, utilizing<br>
centrifugal clutches have not been satisfactory as the engines were typically controlled<br>
by throttle device position, not on a closed loop basis based upon a target engine<br>
speed and/or engine torque, and thus did not provide acceptable control for smooth<br>
vehicle launch and low speed operation. Prior art vehicular driveline systems utilizing<br>
centrifugal master clutches were not provided with clutches having damage and/or<br>
overheating protection and/or were not configured to lock up and release at engine<br>
speeds selected to permit dynamic shifting with the master clutch engaged.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
[0009] In accordance with the present invention, the drawbacks of the prior art<br>
are reduced or minimized by the provision of a centrifugal master friction clutch, and a<br>
vehicular automated transmission system utilizing same, which utilizes closed loop<br>
control to provide acceptable performance for heavy duty vehicle launch operations and<br>
low speed operation and is configured to allow dynamic shifting with the master clutch<br>
engaged. Preferably, the closed loop control will provide protection from damage<br>
and/or overheating.<br>
[0010] The above is accomplished by providing a centrifugal clutch structure<br>
which will initially lockup at an engine speed below the speed at which upshifts are<br>
required and will not release from a lockup condition at engine speeds above (i) the<br>
highest speeds at which down shifts are required and (ii) the lowest allowable expected<br>
engine speed after completion of an upshift and by controlling fueling of the engine<br>
during launch to cause engine speed and/or engine torque to equal or not exceed a<br>
target value determined as a function of sensed input signal values indicative of two or<br>
more of throttle device position, engine speed, engine torque, transmission input shaft<br>
speed, transmission output shaft speed, transmission engaged ratio and clutch slip.<br>
[0011] The centrifugal master clutch requires no external clutch actuator or<br>
sensor, and no connections to mechanical linkages, electrical power and/or fluid power.<br>
[0012] Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a new and<br>
improved centrifugally operated vehicular master friction clutch and automated<br>
mechanical transmission system utilizing same.<br>
[0013] This and other objects and advantages of the present invention will<br>
become apparent from a reading of the following description of the preferred<br>
embodiment taken in connection with the attached drawings.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0022] An at least partially automated vehicular drivetrain system 10 using the<br>
centrifugally operated friction master clutch and control of the present invention is<br>
schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. System 10 may be fully automated, as seen by way<br>
of example in U.S. Patent No.: 4,361,060, partially automated, as seen by way of<br>
example in U.S. Patent No"s: 4,648,290 and 5,409,432, or manual with controller assist,<br>
as seen by way of example in U.S. Patent No"s: 4,850,236; 5,582,558; 5,735,771; and<br>
6,015,366.<br>
[0023] In system 10, a change-gear transmission 12 comprising a main<br>
transmission section 14 connected in series with a splitter-type auxiliary transmission<br>
section 16 is drivingly connected to an internal combustion engine 18, such as a well-<br>
known gasoline or diesel engine, by the centrifugal master friction clutch 20 of the<br>
present invention. Transmissions 12, by way of example, may be of the type well known<br>
in the prior art and are sold by the assignee of this application, EATON<br>
CORPORATION, under the trademarks "Super-10" and "Lightning", and may be seen<br>
in greater detail by reference to U.S. Pat. No"s: 4,754,665; 6,015,366; 5,370,013;<br>
5,974,906; and 5,974,354, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
[0024] Engine 18 includes a crankshaft 22, which is attached to a driving<br>
member 60 of centrifugal master clutch 20, which frictionally engages with, and<br>
disengages from, a driven member 62, which is attached to the input shaft 28 of the<br>
transmission. A transmission output shaft 30 extends from the auxiliary transmission<br>
section 16 for driving connection to the vehicular drive wheels, as through a drive axle<br>
31 or transfer case.<br>
[0025] The terms "engaged" and "disengaged" as used in connection with a<br>
master friction clutch refer to the capacity, or lack of capacity, respectively, of the clutch<br>
to transfer a significant amount of torque. Mere random contact of the friction surfaces,<br>
in the absence of at least a minimal clamping force, is not considered engagement.<br>
[0026] As may be seen from Fig. 1, centrifugal clutch 20 requires no external<br>
clutch actuator and is operated as function of the rotational speed (ES) of the engine.<br>
Centrifugal clutch 20 also requires no connections to operating linkages, command<br>
signal inputs, power electronics and/or compressed air and/or hydraulic conduits. The<br>
most economical application of the present invention is with a dry clutch, however, the<br>
present invention is also applicable to wet clutch technology.<br>
[0027] Transmission system 10 further includes rotational speed sensors 32 for<br>
sensing engine rotational speed (ES), 34 for sensing input shaft rotational speed (IS),<br>
and 36 for sensing output shaft rotational speed (OS), and providing signals indicative<br>
thereof. A sensor 37 provides a signal THL indicative of throttle pedal position or of<br>
torque demand. The signal is usually a percentage (0% to 100%) of fuel throttle<br>
position. Engine 18 may be electronically controlled, including an electronic<br>
controller 38 communicating over an electronic data link (DL) operating under an<br>
industry standard protocol such as SAE J-1922, SAE J-1939, ISO 11898 or the like.<br>
[0028] An X-Y shift actuator, which by way of example may be of the types<br>
illustrated in U.S. Pat. No"s: 5,481,170; 5,281,902; 4,899,609; and 4,821,590, may be<br>
provided for automated or shift-by-wire shifting of the transmission main section and/or<br>
auxiliary section. Alternately, a manually operated shift lever 42 having a shift knob 44<br>
thereon may be provided. Shift knob 44 may be of the type described in<br>
aforementioned U.S. Pat. No: 5,957,001. As is well known, shift lever 42 is manually<br>
manipulated in a known shift pattern for selective engagement and disengagement of<br>
various shift ratios. Shift knob 44 may include an intent to shift switch 44A by which the<br>
vehicle operator will request automatic engine fueling control to relieve torque lock and<br>
allow a shift to transmission neutral. A shift selector 46 allows the vehicle driver to<br>
select a mode of operation and provides a signal GRT indicative thereof.<br>
[0029] System 10 includes a control unit 50, preferably a microprocessor-based<br>
control unit of the type illustrated in U.S. Pat. No"s: 4,595,986; 4,361,065; and<br>
5,335,566, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference, for receiving<br>
input signals 54 and processing same according to predetermined logic rules to issue<br>
command output signals 56 to system actuators, such as engine controller 38, shift<br>
actuator 40, and the like.<br>
[0030] As is known, to disengage a jaw clutch in a vehicular mechanical<br>
transmission, especially in a heavy-duty vehicle, it is necessary to relieve torque lock at<br>
the engaged jaw clutch. If opening the master friction clutch 20 is not desirable, torque<br>
lock can be relieved by fueling the engine to cause assumed zero driveline torque<br>
and/or by forcing torque reversals, which will positively cause crossings of zero driveline<br>
torque.<br>
[0031] Fully or partially automated mechanical transmission systems that, upon<br>
determining that a shift from a currently engaged ratio into neutral and then into a target<br>
ratio is desirable, will, while maintaining the vehicle master friction clutch engaged,<br>
initiate automatic fuel control to cause reduced torque across the jaw clutches to be<br>
disengaged, are also known in the prior art as may be seen by reference to above-<br>
mentioned U.S. Patent No."s: 4,850,236; 5,582,558; 5,735,771; 5,775,639; 6,015,366;<br>
and 6,126,570. Shifting with the master clutch remaining engaged is preferred in many<br>
situations, as such shifts tend to be of a higher shift quality and/or cause less wear on<br>
the driveline. These systems include systems that attempt to fuel the engine to achieve<br>
and maintain a zero driveline torque, see U.S. Patent No.: 4,593,580, the disclosure of<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference, and systems that fuel the engine to force one<br>
or more torque reversals, see U.S. Patent No.: 4,850,236. Upon sensing a<br>
transmission neutral condition, the clutch is maintained engaged and the engine speed<br>
commanded to a substantially synchronous speed for engaging a target gear ratio<br>
(ES=OSxGRT).<br>
[0032] Control of engine torque to achieve a desired output or flywheel torque is<br>
known as and may be seen by reference U.S. Pat No. 5,620,392, the disclosure of<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference. Engine torque as used herein refers to a<br>
value indicative of an engine torque, usually gross engine torque, from which an output<br>
or flywheel torque may be calculated or estimated. The relationship of gross engine<br>
torque to flywheel torque is discussed in U.S. Pat. No"s: 5,509,867 and 5,490,063, the<br>
disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0033] One or more engine torque"s or torque limit values may be commanded<br>
on, or read from, an industry standard data link, DL, such as an SAE J-1922, SAE J-<br>
1939 or ISO11898 compliant datalink.<br>
[0034] By way of example, datalinks complying to the SAE J1939 or similar<br>
protocol, allow the system controller 50 to issue commands over the datalink for the<br>
engine to be fueled in one of several modes, such as (i) in accordance with the<br>
operator"s setting of the throttle, (ii) to achieve a commanded or target engine speed<br>
(ES=EST), (iii) to achieve a commanded or target engine torque (ET=ETT) and (iv) to<br>
maintain engine speed and engine torque below limits (ES<esmax and et></esmax>
Many input/informational signals, such as engine speed (ES), engine torque (ET), and<br>
the like may also be carried by the datalink.<br>
[0035] The structure of the centrifugal clutch 20 will be described in greater detail<br>
below. Clutch 20 includes an input or driving portion 60 fixed for rotation with engine<br>
crankshaft 22 (usually at the engine flywheel), and an output or driven portion 62 fixed<br>
for rotation on transmission input shaft 28. As is known, rotation of the input member<br>
60 will cause clutch 20 to engage and drivingly connect the engine output, usually an<br>
engine flywheel, or the like, to the transmission input shaft 28. The clamping force, and<br>
thus the torque transfer capacity of the clutch 20 is a function of rotational speed (ES)<br>
of engine 18 and clutch input member 60. The clutch 20 should reach incipient<br>
engagement at an engine speed slightly greater than engine idle, and should fully<br>
engage at an engine speed lower than the engine speed at which a first upshift is<br>
required. Unlike typical spring applied master friction clutches, which are normally<br>
engaged, clutch 20 is disengaged at lower engine speeds.<br>
[0036] To allow proper vehicle launch and dynamic shifting with the master clutch<br>
engaged, clutch 20, once fully engaged, should remain fully engaged at engine speeds<br>
greater than (i) the highest expected speed at which downshifts are initiated and (ii) the<br>
minimum expected engine speed after an upshift. Incipient engagement is the initial<br>
torque transfer contact of clutch friction surfaces as may be seen by reference to U.S.<br>
Patent No"s: 4,646,891 and 6,022,295, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein<br>
by reference. Logic for only initiating single or skip upshifts only if the expected engine<br>
speed at completion of the shift exceeds a minimum reference value may be seen by<br>
reference to U.S. Patent No"s: 6,113,516 and 6,149,545, the disclosures of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0037] Figure 2 is a graphical representation of the clamping force, of a preferred<br>
embodiment the clutch 20, and thus the torque transfer capacity, at various engine<br>
speeds.<br>
[0038] In the illustrated example, system 10 is a heavy duty truck driveline,<br>
engine 18 is an electronically controlled diesel engine having an idle speed of about<br>
600RPM to 700RPM, point 64, and a governed top speed of about 1800RPM to<br>
2000RPM. In the preferred embodiment, the clutch 20 will move to incipient<br>
engagement at about 800 RPM, point 66 (ESIE), which is slightly above idle, and will<br>
have an increasing clamp load, line 70, as engine speed increases. The clutch will be<br>
most fully engaged at or below the capped maximum clamp force, 4000 pounds, at<br>
about 1400 RPM, point 72. Once at maximum clamp load, which is selected to lock up<br>
the clutch under extreme conditions (i.e., substantially zero slip at considerably greater<br>
than expected torque loads), the clutch 20 will remain locked up, lines 74 and 76, until<br>
engine speed becomes less than about 850 RPM, point 78. At the release point, the<br>
clutch 20 will very rapidly disengage with decreasing engine speed, line 80, to prevent<br>
engine stalling.<br>
[0039] 850 RPM is below (i) the minimum engine speed at which downshifts will<br>
be commanded and (ii) the minimum expected engine speed at completion of an upshift<br>
at which an upshift, single or skip, will be initiated, see U.S. Patent No. 6,149,545, the<br>
disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Accordingly, a centrifugal<br>
clutch 20 having the performance characteristics indicated on Fig. 2, which will allow a<br>
smooth modulated vehicle launch, and will assure that the clutch remains engaged for<br>
dynamic upshifting and downshifting.<br>
[0040] The structure of a preferred embodiment of centrifugal clutch 20 may be<br>
seen by reference to Fig"s: 5, 6,A, 6B, and 7. Clutch 20 includes a clutch bell housing<br>
assembly 100, friction disc assembly 102, intermediate pressure plate 104, and friction<br>
disc assembly 106. As is well known from conventional clutches, bell housing<br>
assembly 100 and intermediate pressure plate 104 mount to the engine flywheel for<br>
rotation therewith and comprise the driving portion 60 of the clutch, friction disc<br>
assemblies 102 and 106 are typically splined to transmission input shaft 28 and<br>
comprise the driven portion 62 of the clutch.<br>
[0041 ] Portion 20A of clutch 20 may be substantially, structurally, and functionally<br>
identical to existing dual plate clutches. The bell housing assembly includes four<br>
flyweights 110, which are pivoted to the housing assembly at pivot pins 112. Return<br>
springs 114 bias the flyweights 110 radially inwardly to rest on stops 116 (see Fig. 6A).<br>
A stop member 118 limits the radially outward movement of the flyweights (see<br>
Fig.6B). As the engine and the housing 100 rotate, the effect of centrifugal force will<br>
cause the flyweights 110 to move against the bias of springs 114 from the position of<br>
Fig. 6A to the position of Fig. 6B. The flyweights 110 each carry one or more roller 120<br>
or functionally similar wedging member, which will act between a reaction surface and a<br>
ramp to provide an axial clamping force for engaging the master friction clutch 20. Fig.<br>
7 is a schematic illustration of the operational members acted upon by rollers 120. The<br>
members of the clutch 20 are shown in fragments as rotating about the rotational axis<br>
122 of input shaft 28.<br>
[0042] Rollers 120 are received between a substantially flat surface 124 of a<br>
fixed reaction plate 125 and a ramped surface 126 of an axially movable ramp plate<br>
128. Alternatively, surface 124 could be ramped and/or the wedging member could be<br>
of a wedge configuration. Other wedging configurations, may be utilized. The reaction<br>
plate 125 may be manually and/or automatically adjustable by an adjustment<br>
mechanism 125A to take up wear or the like. The ramp plate acts on an axially<br>
movable main pressure plate 130 through a preloaded spring member 132, which will<br>
limit the axial force applied to the main pressure plate 130 by the ramp plate. Main<br>
pressure plate 130 will apply a clamping force CF on the friction pads 134 of the friction<br>
plates which are trapped between surface 130A of the main pressure plate 130 and the<br>
intermediate pressure plate 104 and the intermediate pressure plate 104 and surface<br>
136A of the engine flywheel 136.<br>
The hub portions 140 and 142 of the friction plates 102 and 106, respectively, are<br>
adapted to be splined to input shaft 28 for rotation therewith while plates 125, 128, 130,<br>
and 140 rotate with the engine flywheel 136.<br>
[0043] At rest, one of the rollers 120 will engage the recessed portion 146 of<br>
surface 126 and will not apply a leftward axial clamping force to the friction pads. As<br>
the roller travels sufficiently radially outwardly, and onto the ramped portion 148 of the<br>
ramp surface 126, an increasing axial clamping force is applied (see line 70 on Fig. 2).<br>
As the roller moves further radially outwardly onto the flat extended portion of 150 of<br>
surface 126, the clamp force will remain at a capped value (see lines 74 and 76 of Fig.<br>
2) as limited by preload spring 132. The flyweights 110 will hit stops 118 prior to full<br>
compression of springs 132. Applying force through a spring to limit the maximum force<br>
applied is known in the prior art as may be seen by reference to U.S. Pat No.<br>
5,901,823.<br>
[0044] A greater centrifugal force 152 is required to move rollers 120 up ramp<br>
portion 148 to flat portion 150 than is required to retain the rollers on the flat portion<br>
against the effect of spring force 154 from return springs 114. This accounts for the<br>
difference between the initial maximum clamp force engine RPM value, point 72 on Fig.<br>
2, and the release engine RPM value, point 78 on Fig. 2. Back tapers and/or recesses<br>
may be added to surface 150 and/or the inclination of ramp 148 and/or flat portion 150,<br>
the relative masses and/or the spring rate of spring 114 may be modified to change the<br>
engine speed of disengagement, point 78 on Fig. 2.<br>
[0045] As is known, to launch a heavy duty vehicle, which will occur in a start<br>
ratio (i.e., at a relatively high ratio of input shaft speed to output shaft speed), less<br>
torque at the input shaft is required (for example, 600 to 900 lbs. ft., depending on<br>
grade) than to move the vehicle at high speeds. Typical heavy-duty vehicle diesel<br>
engines will have a maximum torque output of about 1400 to 2200 Ibs-ft. at a maximum<br>
torque RPM.<br>
[0046] For one embodiment of master friction clutch 20, 1000 Ibs-ft of clamp<br>
force will provide a torque capacity of about 600 to 700 Ibs-ft., while 4000 lbs. of clamp<br>
force will provide a torque capacity of about 3000 Ibs-ft., which is well in excess of<br>
engine torque capacity and driveline capacity and provides a large margin of safety<br>
when the clutch is in the capped clamp load condition, lines 74 and 76 of Fig. 2.<br>
[0047] At vehicle launch, i.e., when starting the vehicle from stop, the clutch 20<br>
should lock up at between about 750 RPM and 950 RPM, depending if starting up a<br>
steep grade or in other high resistance conditions . In the vehicle launch mode i.e.,<br>
when vehicle is stopped or at very low vehicle speed, clutch not fully engaged and start<br>
ratio engaged (Rev, 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th in a 10 forward speed transmission), the control<br>
logic of the present invention will operate in a launch mode.<br>
[0048] In the launch mode, the transition from disengagement to engagement of<br>
the centrifugal master clutch is dependent upon increasing engine speed. Without an<br>
engine speed controlling algorithm, the system is prone to abuse and harsh<br>
engagements by careless drivers since a rapid increase in engine speed is equivalent<br>
to "dumping" or "popping" the clutch in a conventional manual clutch arrangement. In<br>
the preferred embodiment of the present invention, by using the SAE J1939<br>
communication link, the control algorithm uses the "speed and torque limit" mode to<br>
control engine speed and rate of change of engine speed during engagement. Once<br>
engagement is sensed, (by monitoring the decreasing difference between engine speed<br>
and input shaft speed), the algorithm switches to a controlled ramp up of requested<br>
engine torque limit starting from existing engine torque at the point of full engagement.<br>
Once the torque has exceeded driver demand, full throttle control is returned to the<br>
driver. Figs. 8A and 8B are a flow chart illustration of a preferred embodiment of the<br>
launch control of the present invention.<br>
[0049] The centrifugal clutch 20 is designed to fully engage at an approximate<br>
engine RPM, (ex: 900RPM). The algorithm uses a throttle position modulated engine<br>
speed limit, (ex: 750RPM to 950RPM), to control the engine speed during engagement.<br>
As an example, see Fig. 3, at 50% throttle position the engine speed would be limited<br>
to 850RPM until engagement was sensed. At the point of engagement the actual<br>
engine torque value is captured and used as the starting point of the throttle "recovery<br>
phase". The J1939 "speed and torque limit" mode is used to ramp the torque limit up<br>
from the starting torque point to a final value. Torque will be ramped up at a rate, which<br>
may vary with throttle position and/or engaged gear ratio. The ramp up rate will<br>
preferably be selected to minimize driveline oscillations and avoid the natural<br>
frequencies of the driveline.<br>
[0050] Since a centrifugal clutch provides increasing clutching force, (torque) with<br>
increasing rotational speed of the clutch, the algorithm uses the throttle pedal setting to<br>
maintain a desired engine speed limit which translates into a desired torque in the<br>
driveline. Figure 3 illustrates a graph of target engine speeds for throttle pedal<br>
positions. By way of example, if the throttle is moved from a zero percent displacement<br>
to a fifty percent displacement, the engine will be commanded to quickly ramp from idle<br>
(about 600-650RPM) to 750RPM, which is the point of clutch incipient engagement,<br>
and then increase to 850RPM in a slower modulated manner. Testing has shown that<br>
a quick ramp rate of about 500RPM/SEC and a modulated ramp rate of about<br>
200RPM/SEC provide satisfactory results. A performance set of ramps, if the driver<br>
applies full (100%) throttle, may be utilized, such as, for example, 750RPM/SEC to<br>
incipient engagement engine speed and then 250RPM/SEC to target speed.<br>
[0051] As used herein, an engine speed may be commanded directly by<br>
commanding a specific engine speed, indirectly by commanding an engine speed limit,<br>
or by commanding a related parameter such as an engine torque or engine torque limit.<br>
[0052] For decreasing throttle position, engine speed is commanded to<br>
immediately equal the lower target value. As engine is fueled to the launch target value<br>
engine speed (such as 850RPM at 50% throttle), and maintained at that value, while<br>
engine speed (ES) is compared to transmission input shaft speed (IS), to sense clutch<br>
slip (ES-IS). When clutch engagement without slip is sensed (ES-IS<rpm ref equal></rpm>
to about+50RPM), the engine will be commanded to ramp up to torque value<br>
corresponding to throttle pedal position and then control of fueling is returned to the<br>
operator. The ramp rates may be modified as a function of the start ratio being utilized,<br>
with quicker rates at higher start ratios (3rd or 4th) than at lower start ratios (1st or 2nd).<br>
Throttle recovery logic, the logic by which fuel control is returned to the operator may be<br>
seen by reference to U.S. Patent No"s: 4,493,228 and 4,792,901, the disclosures of<br>
which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0053] The engine speed target (EST) need not be a linear function of throttle<br>
position and may vary with sensed system parameters such as, for example, start ratio;<br>
see line 82 in Fig. 3. The relationship may also be varied in response to sensed clutch<br>
wear, performance degradation or the like.<br>
[0054] The engine controls of the present invention may also be subject to<br>
engine and/or driveline torque limitations of the types seen in U.S. Patent No"s:<br>
5,797,110; 6,052,638 and; 6,080,082, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein<br>
by reference.<br>
[0055] The control will, preferably, include overheating protection, which can<br>
occur from constant slipping of the clutch under torque (i.e., driver trying to maintain a<br>
stopped position on a grade by slipping the clutch). This can be sensed in several<br>
ways, such as, for example, sensing if vehicle acceleration is less than a reference<br>
value ((dos/dt)<ref or by sensing estimating a clutch temperature from sensed></ref>
vehicle operating conditions, see U.S. Patent No: 4,576,263, the disclosure of which<br>
are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0056] Upon sensing a potential clutch over-heating problem, the control logic<br>
can react by increasing or decreasing engine RPM. If engine RPM is increased, the<br>
clutch will engage causing the operator to use a different method of maintaining vehicle<br>
position. If the engine speed is decreased, the driver will increase throttle position,<br>
which should cause increased engine speed and clutch lockup. To reduce the<br>
likelihood of using a slipping clutch to maintain a stopped position on a grade, the<br>
system could incorporate a hill hold device 160. The hill hold device would be<br>
controlled by ECU 50 and applied when the clutch was disengaged and the indicated<br>
vehicle speed was zero. The hill hold would be released when the throttle was applied<br>
and generated torque reached a predetermined level. Such hill holding devices may,<br>
by way of example, be a separate brake or retarding device or may utilize the vehicle<br>
foundation brakes.<br>
[0057] In an alternate embodiment, a quick release 200 mechanism may be<br>
provided. This mechanism may be desirable in situations where upshifting on a severe<br>
grade (greater than 15% or 20%) may be required. Other severe operating conditions,<br>
such as heavy loading or the like may necessitate the use of the disconnect device 200.<br>
The quick release 200 mechanism is operated by commands from ECU 50 and may<br>
include a positive or a friction clutch device.<br>
[0058] Accordingly, it may be seen that a new and improved transmission system<br>
and centrifugal master friction clutch therefor, is provided.<br>
[0059] Although the present invention has been described with a certain degree<br>
of particularity, it is understood that the description of the preferred embodiment is by<br>
way of example only and that numerous changes to form and detail are possible<br>
without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as hereinafter claimed.<br>
