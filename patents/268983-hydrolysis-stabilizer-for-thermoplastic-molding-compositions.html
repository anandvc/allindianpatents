				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a stabilizer against hydrolysis of polymers and more particularly to a stabilizer mixture that containing carbodiimide and to a material system containing the same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Certain thermoplastic resins, e.g. polyalkylene terephthalates, polyamide and polycarbonate, and their blends are well known and widely used because of their excellent mechanical properties. A significant disadvantage characterizing these materials is a susceptibility to deterioration upon exposure to hot water or water vapor.<br>
Incorporation of carbodiimides in polyalkylene terephthalate is known to improve the resistance of this resin to hydrolysis. U.S. Patent 4,110,302 disclosed a process for producing a reinforced polyalkylene terephthalate molding resin composition. In the process polyalkylene terephthalate polymer in the molten state is mixed with a reinforcing agent and polycarbodiimide. The polycarbodiimide is derived from an aromatic diisocyanate and contains at least two carbodiimide units per polycarbodiimide molecule.<br>
U.S. Patent 4,071,503 disclosed a process for preparing a polycarbodiimide modified thermoplastic polyester whereby polycarbodiimide is incorporated into the structure of thermoplastic saturated polyester, having at least one carboxyl end group. The polycarbodiimide is derived from an aromatic diisocyanate and contains at least three carbodiimide units per polycarbodiimide molecule.<br>
U.S.  Patent 5,733,959 disclosed a thermoplastic molding composition comprising polyester or its blends with polycarbonate or a polyamide and a carbodiimide conforming to a structural formula, the composition said to feature improved resistance to hydrolysis.<br>
Patent 6,855,758 disclosed a  hydrolysis stabilizer  in the  context of<br>
polyester.   In   one   preferred	embodiment,   the  stabilizer  is   polymeric<br>
aromatic carbodiimides and a blend of an organic phosphite and<br>
hydroxyphenyl propionate.<br>
Also presently relevant is the article "Sterically Hindered Carbodiimides: Use of Selective Agents for Hydrolytic Protection of Ester and Imide Groups-Review of Past, Present, and Future" McAfee, E. R. Rhein Chemie Corporation, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. Proceedings of the SPI Annual Technical/Marketing Conference (1992), 34th(Polyurethanes 92), pp 122-7.<br>
Thermoplastic molding compositions that contain polyester carbonate and an inorganic powder, such as boehmite have been disclosed in U.S. Patent 6,831,120.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A stabilizer mixture comprising: i) at least one carbodiimide and ii) co-stabilizer selected from the group consisting of aluminum oxide and aluminum oxyhydroxide is disclosed. The mixture is useful in imparting to polymeric        systems        improved        resistance        to        hydrolysis.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The inventive stabilizer comprise (i) a carbodiimide, and (ii) a co-stabilizer<br>
in a weight ratio of (i)/(ii) of 0.01:1 to 1:0.01.<br>
A carbodiimide in the present context is a compound the molecule of which has at least one carbodiimide group.These compounds are known and available in commerce, e.g., Stabaxol P a product of Rhein Chemie Corporation and may be prepared by known methods (see for instance i European Patent No. 582983; Japanese Patent Publication No. 33279/1972; Journal of Organic Chemistry, 28, 2069-2075 91963); Chemical Review 1981, vol. 81, No. 4, 619-621; Journal of Applied Polymer Science, 1977, vol. 21, 1999-2008, all incorporated herein by reference).<br>
Suitable carbodiimides include compounds conforming to formula (I)<br>

median	particle    diameter    (d50),    determined    by    ultracentrifuge<br>
measurements in accordance with W. Scholtan et al., Kolloid-Z. und Z. Polymere 250 (1972), pp. 782-796.<br>
Polymeric material systems that are deficient in their resistant to hydrolysis are improved upon the incorporation of the inventive stabilizer mixture therein. The amount of stabilizer mixture is at least 0.01, preferably 0.5 most preferably 1.0 percent relative to the weight of the stabilized polymeric material system. The carbodiimide may be present in an amount of 0.01 to 10, preferably 0.1 to 5, more preferably 0.2 to 2 percent relative to the weight of the stabilized polymeric system. The co-stabilizer may be present in an amount of 0.01 to 20, preferably 0.1 to 10, more preferably 0.2 to 2 percent relative to the weight of the stabilized polymeric system.<br>

Suitable glycols include aliphatic diols having 2 to 10 carbon atoms (e.g., ethylene glycol, 1,3-propylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, neopentyl glycol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, decamethylene glycol, cyclohexanediol) as well as long-chain glycols (molecular weight of up to about 6000) such as poly(tetramethylene glycol) and mixtures thereof.<br>
Polyethylene terephthalate is the preferred polyester. The dicarboxylic acid component of the polyethylene terephthalate is mainly terephthalic acid although it may contain up to 10 mol %, based on the total moles of acid, of other aromatic dicarboxylic acids having 6 to 14 carbon atoms, of aliphatic dicarboxylic acids having 4 to 8 carbon atoms or of cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acids having 8 to 12 carbon atoms.

The suitable polyesters may be branched in accordance with known methods.   Polyethylene terephthalate,  the preferred  polyester may be<br>
branched by incorporating relatively small amounts of tri-hydric or tetra-hydric alcohols or tri-basic or tetra-basic acids, in a manner well known in the art. Suitable branching agents include trimesic acid, pyromellitic acid, trimethylolpropane and ethane, and pentaerythritol. Advantageously no more than 1 mol % relative to the quantity of acid component, of branching agent is used.<br>

Pellets thus produced were dried in a forced air convection oven at 120°C. The tensile and Izod bars were made by injection molding at melt temperature of 265 to 285°C and mold temperature around 75°C.<br>
The determination of Izod impact strength was carried out using specimens 1/8" in thickness. Measurements were at 23 °C, in accordance with ASTM D-256. Tensile elongation at break was determined by testing specimens 1/8" in thickness at 23°C, in accordance with ASTM D-638. Melt flow index was determined on dried pellets or molded parts (cut to small pieces) at a specified temperature and specified weight load in accordance with ASTM D-1238.<br>
In examples A to D, all compositions contained 68.86% polycarbonate, 24.95% polyester and 5.99% graft polymer. A phosphite processing stabilizer 0.2% having no criticality in the present context was also included.<br>

The compositions were subjected to hydrolysis    (95°C,  100% relative humidity) for 7 days. Tensile elongation (%) at break and impact strength<br>
(notched Izod, ft-lb/in) ) at 23°C were measured and shown in Tables 2 and 3 respectively.<br>

The change (%) in melt flow of a molded article made of the composition as function of time of exposure to hydrolysis is shown in Table 4<br>
Table 4<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Compositions containing polycarbonate and ABS at a weight ratio of about 70/30 were evaluated as to their resistance to hydrolysis. The polycarbonate used in these examples was homopolycarbonate based on Bisphenol-A having a melt flow index of about 13 g/10 min (Bayer MaterialScience Makrolon 2608 polycarbonate). The ABS used included a mixture of SAN and ABS the rubber content of which was about 75%; the compositions also contained a small amount of conventional additives having no criticality in the present context.<br>
The evaluation enables comparison between the performance of compositions stabilized by the inclusion of the stabilizer mixture of the invention and a corresponding composition that included but one of the components of the stabilizer mixture, the results demonstrating the synergy characterizing the inventive mixture. Tables 5-6 summarize the results. Significantly, a corresponding comparison wherein the resinous composition included polycarbonate only showed no synergy<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
The pellets of compositions 1 to 4 were subjected to hydrolysis (95°C, 100% relative humidity) for 7 days and the melt flow indices (@ 240°C/5kg) were determined. The table shows the percent change in the respective of melt flow indices.<br>
