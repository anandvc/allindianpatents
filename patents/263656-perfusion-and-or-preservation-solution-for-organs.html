PERFUSION AND/OR PRESERVATION SOLUTION FOR ORGANS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a solution for preservation, perfusion, and/or<br>
reperfusion of an organ, especially the heart, for transplantation. The solution<br>
contains peptide inhibitor(s) of protein kinase C beta II (PKC ) and/or of protein<br>
kinase C zeta (PKC  and/or peptide activator(s) of protein kinase C delta (PKC ).<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Successful organ transplantation is often limited due to ischemic/reperfusion<br>
injury. Isolated human hearts deprived of oxygen for more than four hours<br>
progressively loose vigor and often do not survive in recipient hosts. Other organs<br>
such as the kidney, liver, pancreas and lung are also subject to tissue and cellular<br>
damage when removed from their hosts prior to transplantation. This damage is due<br>
to hypoxic conditions and a lack of circulation, which normally delivers physiological<br>
concentrations of oxygen and nutrients, and removes toxic compounds produced by<br>
an organ's cells. Organ transplants have a higher frequency of success when<br>
performed immediately after excision from their hosts.<br>
Recent advances have increased the rate of successful organ transplants and<br>
organ surgery, such as coronary bypass surgery. The first includes organ preservation<br>
and organ perfusion solutions. The second is improved methods and devices for the<br>
delivery of organ perfusion solutions to an organ.<br>
Short-term myocardiac preservation is currently provided by cold storage after<br>
cardioplegic arrest. A variety of processes exist however differing by the composition<br>
of the solution used, the preservation temperature and the administration protocol.<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/076590	PCT/US2006/001266<br>
Different solutions for arresting and preserving the heart have been developed to<br>
protect the myocardium in cardiac surgery. Examples of these solutions include<br>
Krebs-Henseleit solution, UW solution, St. Thomas II solution, Collins solution and<br>
Stanford solution. (See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,798,824 and 4,938,961;<br>
Southard and Belzer, Ann. Rev. Med. 46:235-247 (1995); and Donnelly and Djuric,<br>
Am. J. Hosp. Pharm. 48:2444-2460 (1991)). Nevertheless, organ rejections still<br>
remains due to deterioration in the condition of the transplanted organ between the<br>
time of removal and the restoration of blood flow in the recipient.<br>
Restoration of blood flow is the primary objective for treatment of organ tissue<br>
experiencing prolonged ischemia, e.g., during transplant. However, reperfusion of<br>
blood flow induces endothelium and myocyte injury, resulting in organ dysfunction<br>
(Buerke et al., Am J Physiol 266: H128-136,1994; Lucchesi and Mullane, Ann Rev<br>
Pharmacol Toxicol 26: 2011-2024,1986; and Lucchesi et al., J Mol Cell Cardiol 21:<br>
1241 -1251, 1989). The sequential events associated with reperfusion injury are<br>
initiated by endothelial dysfunction which is characterized by a reduction of the basal<br>
endothelial cell release of nitric oxide (NO) within the first 2.5-5 min post-reperfusion<br>
(Tsao and Lefer, Am J Phyiol 259: H1660-1666,1990). The decrease in endothelial<br>
derived NO is associated with adhesion molecule up-regulation on endothelial and<br>
polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocyte cell membranes (Ma et al., Circ Res 72: 403-<br>
412, 1993; and Weyrich et al., J Leuko Biol 57: 45-55,1995). This event promotes<br>
PMN/endothelial interaction, which occurs by 10 to 20 min post-reperfusion, and<br>
subsequent PMN infiltration into the myocardium is observed by 30 min post<br>
reperfusion (Lefer and Hayward, In The Role of Nitric Oxide in Ischemia-<br>
Reperfusion: Contemporary Cardiology, Loscalzo et al. (Eds.), Humana Press,<br>
Totowa, NJ, pp. 357-380,2000; Lefer and Lefer, Cardiovasc Res 32: 743-751,1996;<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/076590	PCT/US2006/001266<br>
Tsao et al..,Circulation 82. 1402-1412,1990; and Weyrich et al., J Leuko Biol 57:45-<br>
55,1995).<br>
Chemotactic substances released from reperfused tissue and plasma factors<br>
activate PMNs that augment PMN release of cytotoxic substances (i.e. superoxide<br>
anion) and contribute to organ dysfunction following ischemia/reperfusion (Lucchesi<br>
et al. J Mol Cell Cardiol 21: 1241-1251,1989; Ma et al., Circ Res 69: 95-106,1991;<br>
Tsao et al., Circulation 82: 1402-1412,1990; and Tsao et al., Am Heart J 123: 1464-<br>
1471, 1992). Superoxide combines with NO to produce peroxynitrite anion thus<br>
reducing the bioavailability of NO and promotes endothelial dysfunction and PMN<br>
infiltration after myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (Clancey et al.,J Clin Invest 90:<br>
1116-1121,1992; Hansen, Circulation 91: 1872-85,1995; Lucchesi et al., J Mol Cell<br>
Cardiol 21: 1241-1251,1989; Rubanyi and Vanhoutte, Am J Physiol 250: H815-821,<br>
1986; Tsao et al., Am Heart J 123: 1464-1471, 1992; and Weiss, New Eng J Med 320:<br>
365-375, 1989).<br>
Therefore, there remains a need for a solution of improved quality that can<br>
extend the preservation time of an organ for transplantation and protect the organ<br>
from reperfusion injury after ischemia, so that the organ can resume proper function<br>
after restoration of blood flow.<br>

WO 2006/076590	PCT/US2006/001266<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a solution for preservation, perfusion, and/or<br>
reperfusion of an organ, especially the heart, containing peptide inhibitor(s) of protein<br>
kinase C  (PKC ) and/or of protein kinase C  (PKC  and/or peptide<br>
activator(s) of protein kinase C  (PKC ). The solution protects organ tissues and<br>
cells from damage while the organ is isolated from the circulatory system or is<br>
experiencing decreased blood flow (ischemia). The present inventor has discovered<br>
that the peptide inhibitors of PKC  and/or PKC , and/or peptide activator(s) of<br>
PKC  enhance NO release or inhibit endothelial/PMN superoxide release, which can<br>
exert protective effect in organs undergoing ischemia/reperfusion.<br>
In an embodiment, the solution contains about 5-10 M of the peptide<br>
inhibitor of PKC  and/or about 2.5-5 M of the peptide inhibitor of PKC , and/or a<br>
5-10 M of the peptide activator of PKC  dissolved in a saline solution.<br>
The solution of the present invention can be used as a perfusion solution or a<br>
preservation solution. As a perfusion solution, it is pumped into the vasculature of the<br>
organ to protect the organ tissues and cells. As a preservation solution, it serves as a<br>
bathing solution into which the organ is submerged. Preferably, the organ is perfused<br>
with and submerged in the present solution. Further, the present solution also serves<br>
as a reperfusion solution upon restoration of blood flow to the organ after ischemia.<br>
The present invention also include methods of using the solution of the present<br>
invention. These include methods for preserving an organ for transplantation, for<br>
protecting an ischemic organ from damage, for attenuating organ dysfunction after<br>
ischemia, for maintaining nitric oxide release in an ischemic organ, and for protecting<br>
an organ from damage when isolated from the circulatory system.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The present invention provides a solution for the preservation, perfusion,<br>
and/or reperfusion of an organ, especially the heart. The solution contains peptide<br>
inhibitor(s) of protein kinase C  (PKC ) and/or of protein kinase C , (PKC <br>
and/or peptide activator(s) of PKC . Preferably, the peptide inhibitor of PKC  or<br>
the peptide activator of PKC  is present in the solution in an amount of about 5-10<br>

sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1; the peptide inhibitor of PKC  has an amino acid<br>
sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2; and the peptide activator has an amino acid sequence of<br>
SEQ ID NO: 3. Also, in other embodiments, it is preferred that the peptide<br>
inhibitor/activator is myristoylated to facilitate absorption into the cells of the organ.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the peptide inhibito(s) or peptide activator (s) are<br>
dissolved in a saline solution, preferably normal saline (0.9 % NaCl). The peptide<br>
inhibitors) can also be dissolved in known preservation solution, such as Krebs-<br>
Henseleit solution, UW solution, St. Thomas II solution, Collins solution, Stanford<br>
solution, and the like. The solution may also contain one or more of sodium (Na+),<br>
potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), glutamate, arginine, adenosine,<br>
manitol, allopurinol, glutathione, raffinose, and lactobionic acid in concentrations of<br>
about 4-7 mM, about 0.2-0.3 mM, about 108-132 mM, about 13-16 mM, about 18-22<br>
mM, about 2-4 mM, about 0.5-1 mM, about 27-33 mM, about 0.9-1.1 mM, about 2.7-<br>
3.3 mM, about 25-35 mM, and about 80-120 mM, respectively. Na+ can be in the<br>
form of NaOH; K+ can be in the form of KCl and/or KH2PO4, most preferably at ratio<br>
of about 2-3.5 mM KCl and about 2-3.5 mM KH2PO4; Ca2+ can be in the form of<br>

WO 2006/076590	PCT/US2006/001266<br>
CaCl2;and Mg can be in the form of MgCl2. The solution is preferably maintained<br>
at physiological pH of about 7.2-7.4.<br>
The solution of the present invention can be used during all phases of an<br>
organ, especially the heart, transplant, including, but are not limited to, 1) isolating of<br>
the organ from the donor (cardioplegic solution); 2) preserving the organ<br>
(hypothermic storage/transport); and 3) re-implanting the organ in the recipient<br>
(reperfusion solution).<br>
During perfusion or reperfusion, especially for the heart, it is preferred that the organ<br>
be perfused at a rate of about 1 mL/min for about 5 min. The perfusion rate can be<br>
varied, but it should not exceed about 25 mL/min. Overall, the perfusion rate should<br>
not be so high as to impose undue pressure on the vasculature of the organ.<br>
The solution of the present invention can be prepared by 1) dissolving and<br>
diluting the peptide inhibitor(s) and the different constituents in distilled water; 2)<br>
adjusting the pH to about 7.2-7.4, e.g. with NaOH; and 3) sterilizing the solution, e.g.,<br>
by filtering with a 0.2 m filter. The sterilized solution is then kept isolated from<br>
contaminants in the environment.<br>
Without further description, it is believed that one of ordinary skill in the art<br>
can, using the preceding description and the following illustrative examples, make<br>
and utilize the compounds of the present invention and practice the claimed methods.<br>
The following example is given to illustrate the present invention. It should be<br>
understood that the invention is not to be limited to the specific conditions or details<br>
described in this example.<br>
Example 1 - Effects of Peptide Inhibitor of PKC <br>
14<br><br>
WO 2006/076590	PCT/US2006/001266<br>
Male Sprague Dawley rats (275-325 g, Ace Animals, Boyertown, PA) were<br>
anesthetized with 60 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium intraperitoneally (i.p.). Sodium<br>
heparin (1,000 U) was also administered i.p. The hearts were rapidly excised, the<br>
ascending aortas were cannulated, and retrograde perfusion of the heart was initiated<br>
with a modified Krebs buffer maintained at 37°C at a constant pressure of 80 mmHg.<br>
The Krebs buffer had the following composition (in mmol/1): 17 dextrose, 120 NaCl,<br>
25 NaHCO3, 2.5 CaCl2, 0.5 EDTA, 5.9 KCl, and 1.2 MgCl2. The perfusate was<br>
aerated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 and equilibrated at a pH of 7.3-7.4. The two side<br>
arms in the perfusion line proximal to the heart inflow cannula allowed PMNs, plasma<br>
without PKC , peptide inhibitor (control hearts) or plasma containing different<br>
concentrations of PKC , peptide inhibitor (1,2.5 or 5 M) to be directly infused into<br>
the coronary inflow line. Coronary flow was monitored by a flow meter (T106,<br>
Transonic System, Inc., Ithaca, NY). LVDP and +dP/dtmax were monitored using a<br>
pressure transducer (SPR-524, Millar Instruments, Inc., Houston, TX), which was<br>
positioned in the left ventricular cavity. Hearts were immersed in a water-jacketed<br>
reservoir containing 160 mL of Krebs buffer maintained at 37°C. Coronary flow,<br>
LVDP and +dP/dtmax were recorded using a Powerlab Station acquisition system<br>
(ADInstruments, Grand Junction, CO) in conjunction with a computer.<br>
LVDP, +dP/dtmax, and coronary flow were measured every 5 min for 15 min to<br>
equilibrate the hearts and obtain a baseline measurement. LVDP was defined as left<br>
ventricular end-systolic pressure minus left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. After<br>
15 min, the flow of the Krebs buffer was reduced to zero for 20 min to induce global<br>
ischemia. At reperfusion, hearts were infused for 5 min with 200 X 106 PMN<br>
resuspended in 5 mL of Krebs buffer plus 5 mL of plasma at a rate of 1 mL/min. In<br>
some experiments, PKC peptide inhibitor (Genemed Synthesis, Inc., San Francisco,<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2006/076590	PCT/US2006/001266<br>
CA) was added to plasma at a final concentration of 1,2.5 or 5 M. Sham I/R hearts<br>
were not subjected to ischemia and were not perfused with PMNs.<br>
The following groups of isolated perfused rat hearts were used:<br>
Group 1: Sham Ischemia/Reperfusion (I/R) hearts was not subjected to<br>
ischemia and not perfused with PMNs, but was perfused with 5 mL of plasma (1<br>
mL/min) at 35 minutes into perfusion (the same time point that I/R hearts would be<br>
given 5 mL of plasma, 15 minutes of baseline recordings plus 20 minutes ischemia).<br>
These hearts represented a control group to determine if the isolated rat heart can<br>
maintain LVDP and +dP/dtmax throughout the 80-minute protocol (n=6).<br>
Group 2: Sham I/R + PKC , peptide inhibitor (5 M) hearts were not<br>
subjected to ischemia and not perfused with PMNs. These hearts were administered<br>
the PKC , peptide inhibitor (5 M, dissolved in plasma from a 5 mM stock in H2O)<br>
35 minutes into perfusion. This group was employed to determine if the PKC <br>
peptide inhibitor causes a cardiotonic or cardiodepressant effect (n=6).<br>
Group 3: I/R hearts were subjected to 20 min of ischemia and perfused with 5<br>
mL of plasma (1 mL/min) during the first 5 min of reperfusion, but were not perfused<br>
with PMNs. These hearts represented a control group to determine if 20 min of<br>
ischemia followed by reperfusion stuns the heart, but LVDP and +dP/dtmax will<br>
recover to baseline values (initial) by the end of the 45-minute reperfusion period<br>
(n=6).<br>
Group 4: I/R + PKC , peptide inhibitor (5 M, dissolved in plasma) hearts<br>
were subjected to 20 min. of ischemia and not perfused with PMNs. These hearts<br>
were perfused with 5 mL of plasma + PKC  inhibitor during the first 5 min of<br>
reperfusion. This group was employed to determine if the PKC  peptide inhibitor<br>
caused a cardiodepressant effect in the setting of I/R without PMNs (n=6).<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2006/076590	PCT/US2006/001266<br>
Group 5: I/R + PMNs hearts were subjected to 20 min of ischemia and<br>
perfused with 5 mL of plasma (1 mL/min) and PMNs (resuspended in 5 mL Krebs<br>
buffer) during the first 5 min of reperfusion. These hearts represented a control group<br>
to determine if 20 min of ischemia followed by 45 min reperfusion in the presence of<br>
PMNs (200 x 106) resulted in a sustained cardiac contractile dysfunction throughout<br>
the 45 min reperfusion period compared to initial baseline values (n=6).<br>
Group 6: I/R + PMNs + PKC peptide inhibitor (1 M) hearts were subjected<br>
to 20 min of ischemia and perfused with 1 M PKC  peptide inhibitor (dissolved in<br>
plasma) and PMNs (200 x 106) during the first 5 minutes of reperfusion. These hearts<br>
represented a group to determine the effect of PKC , inhibition in attenuating PMN-<br>
induced cardiac contractile dysfunction (n=6).<br>
Group 7: I/R + PMNs + PKC  peptide inhibitor (2.5 M) hearts were<br>
subjected to 20 min of ischemia and perfused with 2.5 M PKC  peptide inhibitor<br>
(dissolved in plasma) and PMNs (200 x 106) during the first 5 minutes of reperfusion.<br>
These hearts represented a group to determine the effect of PKC inhibition in<br>
attenuating PMN-induced cardiac contractile dysfunction (n=6).<br>
Group 8: I/R + PMNs + PKC  peptide inhibitor (5 M) hearts were subjected<br>
to 20 min of ischemia and are perfused with 5 M PKC  peptide inhibitor (dissolved<br>
in plasma) and PMNs (200 x 106) during the first 5 minutes of reperfusion. These<br>
hearts represented a group to determine the effect of PKC  inhibition at a higher<br>
concentration of the PKC peptide inhibitor in attenuating PMN-induced cardiac<br>
contractile dysfunction (n=6).<br>
Group 9: I/R + PMNs + PKC peptide inhibitor (5 M) + NG-nitro-L-<br>
arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 50 M) hearts were subjected to 20 min of ischemia<br>
and perfused with 5 M PKC peptide inhibitor (dissolved in 5 mL plasma) and 50<br>

dissolved in Krebs buffer from 50 mM stock in H2O) and PMNs (200<br>
x 106) during the first 5 minutes of reperfusion. The L-NAME (50 M) was<br>
continually infused into the heart throughout the 45 min reperfusion period. These<br>
hearts represent a group to determine if the cardioprotective effect of PKC peptide<br>
inhibition could be blocked with a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NAME) (n=5).<br>
Data were recorded every 5 min for 45 min post-reperfusion. After each<br>
experiment, the left ventricle was isolated, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stored<br>
at 4°C for later histological analysis.<br>
Figure 1 showed the time course of cardiac contractile function (i.e., LVDP).<br>
The data from the sham I/R, I/R, I/R+PMN+ PKC  peptide inhibitor (5 M) and<br>
I/R+PMN groups illustrated the relative changes in LVDP during the 80 min<br>
perfusion period. As shown, the sham I/R remained near or greater than 100% of<br>
initial baseline values of LVDP for the entire perfusion period. The I/R hearts<br>
experienced a depression in LVDP at the beginning of reperfusion, but recovered to<br>
95±7% of initial baseline values by the end of reperfusion. In contrast, the I/R+PMN<br>
hearts suffered severe cardiac contractile dysfunction, recovering to only 47±7% of<br>
initial baseline values by 45 min post-reperfusion. Conversely, the I/R+PMN+ PKC <br>
peptide inhibitor (5 M) hearts recovered to 84±4% at 45 min post-reperfusion.<br>
To determine whether PKC peptide inhibitor produced direct inotropic<br>
effects on cardiac contractile function, non-ischemic sham I/R hearts were perfused<br>
with PKC  peptide inhibitor (5M). Treatment of Sham I/R hearts with PKC <br>
peptide inhibitor did not result in any significant change in LVDP (Fig. 2) or<br>
+dP/dtmax (Fig. 3) during the 80 min perfusion period, demonstrating the PKC <br>
peptide inhibitor at 5 M exerts no direct effect on cardiac contractile function. A 15<br>
M PKC peptide inhibitor concentration was initially tested, since this concentration<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2006/076590	PCT/US2006/001266<br>
corresponded with an 82% inhibition of PMN superoxide release. However, 15 M<br>
produced a cardiodepressant effect (50% reduction in LVDP Sham I/R hearts) and<br>
could not be used in these experiments (data not shown).<br>
Figures 2 and 3 showed the initial and final values for LVDP and +dP/dtmax<br>
from isolated perfused rat hearts. The initial baselines were similar for all groups.<br>
However, the final LVDP and +dP/dtmax (45 min post-reperfusion) was significantly<br>
decreased (p
with PMNs compared to its initial baseline. The PKC  peptide inhibitor (2.5 M and<br>
5 M concentrations) significantly attenuated the decrease in LVDP and +dP/dtmax<br>
associated with post-ischemic reperfusion with PMNs. In the group receiving 5 M<br>
of drug, the hearts recovered to 84±4% and 76±5% for final LVDP and +dP/dtmax<br>
compared to its initial baseline. The lowest effective dose was observed at 2.5 M;<br>
and these hearts recovered to 83±4% for LVDP and 75±5% for +dP/dtmax compared to<br>
initial baseline values. The cardioprotective effects of the PKC peptide inhibitor (5<br>
M) were blocked in the presence of L-NAME (50 M). These hearts only recovered<br>
to 58±7% and 54±9% for LVDP and +dP/dtmax, respectively, at 45 min post-<br>
reperfusion compared to its initial baseline. These hearts were similar to the IR +<br>
PMN group (47±7% and 41±7% LVDP, +dP/dtmax). At 1 M, PKC  peptide<br>
inhibitor treated hearts exposed to I/R + PMNs only recovered to 57±10% and 46±6%<br>
for LVDP and + dP/dtmax, respectively, at 45 min post-reperfusion compared to its<br>
initial baseline. These hearts were not significantly different from control I/R + PMN<br>
hearts at 45 min post-reperfusion at this lower dose.<br>
The' cardiac injury associated with I/R in this model was closely correlated<br>
with the substantial number of PMNs infiltrating the myocardium within the 45 min<br>
reperfusion period. During reperfusion, a significant number of PMNs transmigrated<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2006/076590	PCT/US2006/001266<br>
into the myocardium, increasing from less than 25 PMN/mm2 in Sham I/R hearts to<br>
more than 180 PMN/ mm2 in I/T +PMN hearts at the end of the reperfusion period<br>
(Fig. 4a). In contrast, I/R+PMN+PKC  peptide inhibitor treated hearts experienced a<br>
20±6%, 46±4 % and 48±3% significant reduction in PMN infiltration into the post-<br>
reperfused cardiac tissue at 1,2.5 and 5M (p
blocked in the presence of L-NAME. Furthermore, the 2.5 and 5 M treated hearts<br>
had significantly fewer infiltrated PMNs compared to 1 M treated hearts (p
(Fig. 4a).<br>
PMN adherence to coronary vascular endothelium was also evaluated within<br>
the assessment of total intravascular and infiltrated PMNs. As seen in Figure 4b, the<br>
number of adherent PMNs to the coronary endothelium was not significantly reduced<br>
in I/R+PMN+PKC  peptide inhibitor hearts (5 M) (43±10%, p
release from rat aortic endothelium was measured to determine if PKC peptide<br>
inhibitor provides cardioprotection by a mechanism involving increased endothelial<br>
NO release. In Figure 5, PKC  peptide inhibitor-treated endothelium generated<br>
significantly more NO by 47±2% (2.5 M, p
91±15% (15 M, p
not significantly different from basal NO release. Acetylcholine (200 nM) was used<br>
as a positive control in the NO assay, and significantly increased NO release by<br>
67±4% (p
used as another control in order to decrease basal release of NO to zero. Both the<br>
acetylcholine and the PKC  peptide inhibitor-induced production of NO were<br>
completely inhibited by treating the endothelium with L-NAME (400 M). To<br>
attribute the source of the NO to the endothelium, experiments with endothelium<br>

removed (denuded) rat aortic segments were incubated with PKC peptide inhibitor<br>
(5 M) and were not different from L-NAME -treated segments.<br>
Another mechanism of the cardioprotective effects of PKC peptide inhibitor<br>
may be related to inhibition of superoxide release. PKC  peptide inhibitor<br>
significantly inhibited superoxide release by 33-82% (2,5 -15 M, p
1 M where there was no difference from suspensions of PMA-stimulated rat PMNs<br>
(Fig. 6). SOD (10 g /mL) was used as a positive control in the superoxide assays,<br>
and degraded superoxide release produced by the PMA-stimulated rat PMNs by 99%<br>

The following groups of isolated perfused rat hearts were used:<br>
Group 1: Sham I/R hearts were not subjected to ischemia and were not<br>
perfused with PMNs, but were perfused with 5 mL of plasma (1 mL/min) at 35<br>
minutes into perfusion (the same time point that I/R hearts would be given 5 mL of<br>

Group 3: I/R hearts were subjected to 20 min of ischemia and perfused with 5<br>
mL of plasma (1 mL/min) during the first 5 min of reperfusion, but were not perfused<br>
with PMNs. These hearts represented a control group to determine if 20 min of<br>

recover to baseline values (initial) by the end of the 45-minute reperfusion period<br>
(n=6).<br>
Group 4: I/R + PKC  peptide inhibitor (10 M, dissolved in plasma) hearts<br>
were subjected to 20 min of ischemia and not perfused with PMNs. These hearts<br>
were perfused with 5 mL of plasma + PKC  peptide inhibitor during the first 5 min<br>
of reperfusion. This group was employed to determine if the PKC  peptide<br>
inhibitor causes a cardiodepressant effect in the setting of I/R without PMNs (n=6).<br>
Group 5: I/R + PMNs hearts were subjected to 20 min of ischemia and<br>
perfused with 5 mL of plasma (1 mL/min) and PMNs (resuspended in 5 mL Krebs<br>
buffer) during the first 5 min of reperfusion. These hearts represented a control group<br>
to determine if 20 min of ischemia followed by 45 min reperfusion in the presence of<br>
PMNs (200 x 106) resulted in a sustained cardiac contractile dysfunction throughout<br>
the 45 min reperfusion period compared to initial baseline values (n=9).<br>
Group 6: I/R + PMNs + PKC  peptide inhibitor (1 M) hearts were<br>
subjected to 20 min of ischemia and perfused with 1 M PKC  peptide inhibitor<br>
(dissolved in plasma) and PMNs (200 x 106) during the first 5 minutes of reperfusion.<br>
These hearts represented a group to determine the effect of PKC  inhibition in<br>
attenuating PMN-induced cardiac contractile dysfunction (n=6).<br>
Group 7: I/R + PMNs + PKC  peptide inhibitor (5 M) hearts were<br>

cardiac contractile dysfunction (n=7).<br>
Group 8: I/R + PMNs + PKC  peptide inhibitor (10 M) hearts were<br>
subjected to 20 min of ischemia and perfused with 10 M PKC  peptide inhibitor<br>
(dissolved in plasma) and PMNs (200 x 106) during the first 5 minutes of reperfusion.<br>
These hearts represented a group to determine the effect of PKC  inhibition at a<br>
higher concentration of the PKC  peptide inhibitor in attenuating PMN-induced<br>
cardiac contractile dysfunction (n=7).<br>
Group 9: I/R + PMNs + PKC  peptide inhibitor (10 M) + NG-nitro-L-<br>
arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 50 M) hearts were subjected to 20 min of ischemia<br>
and perfused with 10 M PKC II peptide inhibitor (dissolved in 5 mL plasma) and<br>
50 M L-NAME (dissolved in Krebs buffer from 50 mM stock in H2O) and PMNs<br>
(200 x 106) during the first 5 minutes of reperfusion. The L-NAME (50 M) was<br>
continually infused into the heart throughout the 45 min reperfusion period. These<br>
hearts represented a group to determine if the cardioprotective effect of PKC <br>
peptide inhibition can be blocked with a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NAME)<br>
(n=6).<br>
Previous studies showed that sham I/R hearts given PMNs exhibited no<br>
changes from initial control values (Lefer et al., Circulation 100: 178-184, 1999).<br>
Data were recorded every 5 min for 45 min post-reperfusion. After each experiment,<br>
the left ventricle was isolated, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stored at 4°C for<br>
later histological analysis.<br>
Figure 7 showed the time course of cardiac contractile function (LVDP) for<br>
the sham I/R, I/R, I/R+PMN+PKC  peptide inhibitor (10 M) and I/R+PMN<br>
23<br><br>
WO 2006/076590	PCT/US2006/001266<br>
groups, and illustrated the changes in LVDP during the 80 min perfusion period. The<br>
hearts in the Sham I/R group remained at 103±4% of initial baseline values of LVDP<br>
for the entire duration of the perfusion period. Hearts in the I/R group experienced a<br>
depression in LVDP during the initial stages of reperfusion, but by the end of<br>
reperfusion they had recovered to 94±6% of initial baseline values. However, the<br>
hearts in the I/R+PMN group exhibited severe cardiac contractile dysfunction, only<br>
recovering to 43±5% of initial baseline values by the end of reperfusion. By contrast,<br>
the hearts in the I/R+PMN+PKC  peptide inhibitor (10 M), although initially<br>
showing a depression in LVDP of 61±10% of initial baseline values at 15 min into<br>
reperfusion, recovered to 82±9% of baseline.<br>
In order to establish whether the PKC II peptide inhibitor produced any direct<br>
inotropic effects on cardiac contractile function, Sham I/R hearts were perfused with<br>
PKC  peptide inhibitor (10 M). This group served as one of the controls for the<br>
study. These hearts did not show any significant change in LVDP (Fig. 8) or<br>
+dP/dtmax (Fig. 9) at the end of the 80 min reperfusion period, thus, indicating that at<br>

function. A 20M dose of PKC  peptide inhibitor was tested on a Sham I/R heart<br>
and there were no cardiodepressant effects noticed at this dose.<br>
Figs. 8 and 9 showed the initial and final values for LVDP and +dp/dtmax from<br>
isolated perfused hearts respectively. There was no significant difference between the<br>
initial baseline values of all the groups studied. There was also no significant<br>
difference between the initial and final values of LVDP and +dP/dtmax for the Sham<br>
I/R, I/R, Sham I/R+PKC  peptide inhibitor (5 M)5 and I/R+PKC  peptide<br>

The 1 M dose of PKC  peptide inhibitor was not cardioprotective as the hearts in<br>

The cardioprotective effects of the PKC  peptide inhibitor (10 M) were<br>
blocked by the presence of L-NAME (50 M) in the IR+PMN+PKC  peptide<br>
inhibitor (10 M)+L-NAME (50 M) group, as the LVDP and+dP/dtmax values at the<br>

NO release from rat aortic endothelium was measured to determine if PKC <br>
peptide inhibitor provides cardioprotection by a mechanism involving increased<br>
endothelial NO release. Fig. 10 showed that segments of the endothelium treated with<br>
PKC  peptide inhibitor generated significantly more NO when compared to the<br>
basal NO release at 5 M (p
release was measured at 1.85±0.18 pmoles NO/mg tissue. There was a definite dose-<br>
response effect of stimulating the endothelium with PKC  peptide inhibitor as the 1<br>
M, 2.5 M, 5 M and 10 M produced an increase in NO release above basal of<br>
0.75±0.19,1.91±0.44,2.54±0.29, and 3.49±0.62 pmoles NO/mg tissue, respectively.<br>
Acetylcholine (Ach, 500 nM) was used as a positive control in this assay and<br>
stimulated the endothelium causing an increase of 3.75±0.58 pmoles NO/mg tissue,<br>
above the baseline basal value. L-NAME was used as another control in order to<br>
decrease basal release of NO to zero. Both the acetylcholine and PKC  peptide<br>
inhibitor production of NO were completely inhibited by treating the endothelium<br>
with L-NAME (400 M).<br>
Another mechanism that may contribute to the cardioprotective effects (i.e.<br>
LVDP) of the PKC II peptide inhibitor may be inhibition of PMN superoxide<br>
release. PKC  peptide inhibitor significantly inhibited superoxide release (i.e.<br>
absorbance) from suspensions of fMLP-stimulated rat PMNS from 0.13±0.01 to<br>
0.05±0.009 (p0.0l), 0.02±0.004 (p0.0l), and 0.02±.007 (p0.0l) for 5 M, 10 M<br>
and 20 M respectively (Fig. 11). There was no significant inhibition of superoxide<br>
at the 1 uM dose. SOD (10 g/ml) was used as a positive control and it scavenged the<br>
superoxide released by the fMLP-stimulated rat PMNs reducing the response to<br>
0.0016±0.0006.<br>

Example 3 - Effects of Peptide Inhibitors of PKC  and PKC ζ in Combination<br>
Experiments with PKC  and PKC ζ peptide inhibitors were performed<br>
substantially as described in Examples 1 and 2.<br>
The following groups of isolated perfused rat hearts were used:<br>
Group 1: Sham I/R hearts were not subjected to ischemia and were not<br>
perfused with PMNs, but were perfused with 5 mL of plasma (1 mL/min) at 35<br>
minutes into perfusion (the same time point that 1/R hearts would be given 5 mL of<br>
plasma, 15 minutes of baseline recordings plus 20 minutes ischemia). These hearts<br>
represented a control group to determine if the isolated rat heart can maintain LVDP<br>
and +dP/dtmax throughout the 80-minute protocol (n=6).<br>
Group 2: Sham 1/R + PKC  (10 M) + PKC ζ (5 M) peptide inhibitors<br>
hearts were not subjected to ischemia and not perfused with PMNs. These hearts<br>
were administered the PKC  and PKC ζ peptide inhibitor (10 M and 5 M,<br>
respectively, dissolved in plasma from a 5 mM stock in H20) 35 minutes into<br>
perfusion. This group was employed to determine if the peptide inhibitors cause a<br>
cardiotonic or cardiodepressant effect (n=6).<br>
Group 3: I/R hearts were subjected to 20 min of ischemia and perfused with 5<br>
mL of plasma (1 mL/min) during the first 5 min of reperfusion, but were not perfused<br>
with PMNs. These hearts represented a control group to determine if 20 min of<br>
ischemia followed by reperfusion stunned the heart, but LVDP and +dP/dW will<br>
recover to baseline values (initial) by the end of the 45-minute reperfusion period<br>
(n=6).<br>
Group 4: I/R + PKC  (10 M) + PKC ζ (5 M) peptide inhibitors<br>
(dissolved in plasma) hearts were subjected to 20 min of ischemia and not perfused<br>
with PMNs. These hearts were perfused with 5 mL of plasma + PKC I + PKC ζ<br>

PKC XXX at a higher concentration of the PKC  peptide inhibitor in<br>
attenuating PMN-induced cardiac contractile dysfunction (n=7).<br>
Group 9: I/R + PMNs + PKC  (10 M) + PKC ζ (5 M) peptide inhibitors<br>
+ NGnitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 50 M) hearts were subjected to 20<br>
min of ischemia and perfused with 10 M PKC  and 5 M PKC ζ peptide inhibitor<br>
(dissolved in 5 mL plasma) and 50 M L-NAME (dissolved in Krebs buffer from 50<br>
mM stock in H20) and PMNs (200 x 106) during the first 5 minutes of reperfusion.<br>
The L-NAME (50 M) was continually infused into the heart throughout the 45 min<br>
reperfusion period. These hearts represented a group to determine if the<br>
cardioprotective effect of the peptide inhibitors can be blocked with a nitric oxide<br>
synthase inhibitor (L-NAME) (n=5).<br>
From the time course of Fig.12, the combination of PKC  (10 M) and<br>
PKC ζ (5 M) peptide inhibitors resulted in a recovery rate matching that of the I/R<br>
heart. This result was not observed when either PKC II (10 M) or PKC ζ (5 M)<br>
peptide inhibitor was used alone (Examples 1 and 2) where the recovery rate of the<br>
peptide inhibitor treated heart was slower than that of the I/R heart.<br>
Figs. 13 and 14 showed the initial and final values for LVDP and +dP/dtmax<br>
from isolated perfused hearts respectively. As expected and similar to Examples 1<br>
and 2, the initial and final values of LVDP and +dP/dtmax for the I/R+PMN group<br>
change significantly, decreasing (p
and by about 45% in +dP/dtmax at 45 min post-reperfusion.<br>
The presence of the PKC  and PKC ζ peptide inhibitors attenuated the<br>
decrease in LVDP and +dP/dtmax associated with the post-ischemic perfusion with<br>
PMNs. The 10 M PKC  and 5 M PKC ζ peptide inhibitors dose was the most<br>
cardioprotective. Increasing the PKC  peptide inhibitors dosage from 5 M to 10<br>

I/R+PMN+PKC II+PKC ζ peptide inhibitors hearts. This protective effect was<br>
reversed in the presence of L-NAME.<br>
In Figure 17, endothelium of hearts treated with PKC  and PKC ζ peptide<br>
inhibitors generated significantly more NO release, particularly at a dosage of 10 M<br>
PKC  and 5 M PKC ζ peptide inhibitors, compared to basal NO release.<br>
Acetylcholine (500 nM) was used as a positive control in the NO assay, and<br>
significantly increased NO release compared to basal NO release. L-NAME was used<br>
as another control in order to decrease basal release of NO to zero. Both the<br>
acetylcholine and the peptide inhibitors-induced production of NO were completely<br>
inhibited by treating the endothelium with L-NAME (400 μM).<br>
Another mechanism of the cardioprotective effects of PKC II and PKC ζ<br>
peptide inhibitors may be related to inhibition of superoxide release. As seen from<br>
Fig. 18, the combination of PKC II and PKC ζ peptide inhibitors significantly<br>
inhibited superoxide release when compared to suspensions of PMA-stimulated rat<br>
PMNs or when compared to PKC  or PKC ζ peptide inhibitor used alone. SOD (10<br>
(ig/mL) was used as a positive control in the superoxide assays, and degraded<br>
superoxide release produced by the PMA-stimulated rat PMNs by 99% (Fig. 18).<br>
The Examples all showed that the presence of sufficient amount of PKC <br>
peptide inhibitor and/or PKC ζ peptide inhibitor provided significant cardioprotective<br>
effect by attenuating PMN-induced cardiac dysfunction.<br>
Example 4 - Effects of Peptide Activator of PKC <br>
Experiments with PKC peptide activators were performed substantially as<br>
described in Example 1 for PKCζ peptide inhibitor.<br>
The following groups of isolated perfused rat hearts were used:<br>

represented a control group to determine if the isolated rat heart can maintain LVDP<br>

Group 2: Sham I/R + PKC  peptide activator (10 M) hearts were not<br>
subjected to ischemia and not perfused with PMNs. These hearts were administered<br>
the PKC  peptide activator (10 M, dissolved in plasma from a 5 mM stock in H20)<br>
35 minutes into perfusion. This group was employed to determine if the PKC <br>
peptide activator causes a cardiotonic or cardiodepressant effect (n=6).<br>
Group 3: I/R hearts were subjected to 20 min of ischemia and perfused with 5<br>
mL of plasma (1 mL/min) during the first 5 min of reperfusion, but were not perfused<br>
with PMNs. These hearts represented a control group to determine if 20 min of<br>
ischemia followed by reperfusion stunned the heart, but LVDP and +dP/dtmax will<br>
recover to baseline values (initial) by the end of the 45-minute reperfusion period<br>
(n=6).<br>
Group 4: I/R + PKC  peptide activator (10 μM, dissolved in plasma) hearts<br>
were subj ected to 20 min of ischemia and not perfused with PMNs. These hearts<br>
were perfused with 5 mL of plasma + PKC  peptide activator during the first 5 min<br>
of reperfusion. This group was employed to determine if the PKC  peptide activator<br>
causes a cardiodepressant effect in the setting of I/R without PMNs (n=6).<br>
Group 5: I/R + PMNs hearts were subjected to 20 min of ischemia and<br>
perfused with 5 mL of plasma (1 mL/min) and PMNs (resuspended in 5 mL Krebs<br>
buffer) during the first 5 min of reperfusion. These hearts represented a control group<br>

to determine it 20 min or Ischemia followed by 45 min reperfusion in the presence of<br>
PMNs (200 x 106) resulted in a sustained cardiac contractile dysfunction throughout<br>
the 45 min reperfusion period compared to initial baseline values (n=l 0).<br>
Group 6: I/R + PMNs + PKC  peptide activator (1 μM) hearts were<br>
subjected to 20 min of ischemia and perfused with 1 μM PKC II peptide inhibitor<br>
(dissolved in plasma) and PMNs (200 x 106) during the first 5 minutes of reperfusion.<br>
These hearts represented a group to determine the effect of PKC 8 activation in<br>
attenuating PMN-induced cardiac contractile dysfunction (n=6).<br>
Group 7: I/R + PMNs + PKC  peptide activator (5 μM) hearts were<br>
subjected to 20 min of ischemia and perfused with 5 μM PKC  peptide inhibitor<br>
(dissolved in plasma) and PMNs (200 x 106) during the first 5 minutes of reperfusion.<br>
These hearts represented a group to determine the effect of PKC  activation at a<br>
higher concentration of the PKC  peptide activator in attenuating PMN-induced<br>
cardiac contractile dysfunction (n=6).<br>
Group 8: I/R + PMNs + PKC  peptide activator (10 μM) hearts were<br>
subjected to 20 min of ischemia and perfused with 10 μM PKC  peptide activator<br>
(dissolved in plasma) and PMNs (200 x 106) during the first 5 minutes of reperfusion.<br>
These hearts represented a group to determine the effect of PKC  activation at a<br>
higher concentration of the PKC  peptide activator in attenuating PMN-induced<br>
cardiac contractile dysfunction (n=6).<br>
Previous studies showed that sham I/R hearts given PMNs exhibited no<br>
changes from initial control values (Lefer et al., Circulation 100: 178-184, 1999).<br>
Data were recorded every 5 min for 45 min post-reperfusion. After each experiment,<br>
the left ventricle was isolated, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stored at 4°C for<br>
later histological analysis.<br>

WO 2006/076590	PCT/US2006/001266<br>
Figure 19 showed the time course of cardiac contractile function (LVDP) for<br>
the sham I/R, I/R, I/R+PMN+PKC  peptide activator (10 μM) and I/R+PMN groups,<br>
and illustrated the changes in LVDP during the 80 min perfusion period. The hearts<br>
in the Sham I/R group remained at 103±4% of initial baseline values of LVDP for the<br>
entire duration of the perfusion period. Hearts in the I/R group experienced a<br>
depression in LVDP during the initial stages of reperfusion, but by the end of<br>
reperfusion they had recovered to 82±3% of initial baseline values. However, the<br>
hearts in the I/R+PMN group exhibited severe cardiac contractile dysfunction, only<br>
recovering to 46±9% of initial baseline values by the end of reperfusion. By contrast,<br>
the hearts in the I/R+PMN+PKC  peptide activator (10 μM), although initially<br>
showing a depression in LVDP of 58±8% of initial baseline values at 15 min into<br>
reperfusion, recovered to 83±3% of baseline.<br>
In order to establish whether the PKC  peptide activator produced any direct<br>
inotropic effects on cardiac contractile function, Sham I/R hearts were perfused with<br>
PKC  peptide activator (10 μM). This group served as one of the controls for the<br>
study. These hearts did not show any significant change in LVDP (Fig. 20) or<br>
+dP/dtmax (Fig. 21) at the end of the 80 min reperfusion period, thus, indicating that at<br>
this dose the PKC  peptide activator had no direct effect on cardiac contractile<br>
function.<br>
Figs. 20 and 21 showed the initial and final values for LVDP and +dP/dtmax<br>
from isolated perfused hearts respectively. There was no significant difference<br>
between the initial baseline values of all the groups studied. There was also no<br>
significant difference between the initial and final values of LVDP and +dP/dtmax for<br>
the Sham I/R, I/R, Sham I/R+PKC  peptide activator and I/R+PKC  peptide<br>
activator (10 μM) groups. However, there was a significant difference between the<br>

initial and final values of LVDP and +dP/dtmax for the MR+PMN group. A significant<br>
decrease (p
45 min post-reperfusion was observed.<br>
The presence of the PKC  peptide activator at a 5 μM and 10 μM dose<br>
attenuated the decrease in LVDP and +dP/dtmax associated with the post-ischemic<br>
perfusion with PMNs. The 10 μM dose the was the most cardioprotective as the<br>
hearts in the I/R+PMN+PKC  peptide activator (10 μM) recovered to 83±3% and<br>
79±5% of initial baseline at 45 min post-reperfusion for LVDP and +dP/dtmax,<br>
respectively. These values were significantly different from I/R+PMN at 45 min<br>
post-reperfusion (p
the same extent as the 10 μM dose, as the hearts in the I/R+PMN+PKC  peptide<br>
activator (5 μM) recovered to 80±9% and 67±7% for LVDP and +dP/dtmax of initial<br>
baseline at 45 min post-reperfusion, respectively. The LVDP values for the 5 μM<br>
dose were significantly different from I/R+PMN at 45 min post-reperfusion (p
The 1 μM dose of PKC  peptide activator was not cardioprotective as the hearts in<br>
the I/R+PMN+PKC  peptide activator (1 μM) group only recovered to 60±13% and<br>

A mechanism that may contribute to the cardioprotective effects (i.e. LVDP)<br>
of the PKC  peptide activator may be inhibition of PMN superoxide release. PKC <br>
