				<td>COLORANT COMPOSITIONS Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] This invention relates to surprisingly effective triphenylmethane colorant compositions, which exhibit low color degradation in alkaline media.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002] Colorant compositions are useful for a wide variety of product applications.   For example, colorants are used in tinting of polymers, for providing coloration to aqueous solution(s), and affording color to solid or semi-solid products such as detergents.    Crayons, ink compositions, toilet bowl colorants, plastics, soaps, and many other products are colored using triphenylamine-based colorant compositions.<br>
[0003] Triphenylmethane ("TPM") colorants consist of three aromatic rings linked by a central carbon atom. TPM colorants can be prepared by first condensing an aromatic aldehyde with two equivalents of an aromatic amine (which will hereafter be referred to as the "coupler" or "coupling component") in the presence of an acid such as sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, or muriatic acid. After condensation, the uncolored intermediate is oxidized using a variety of oxidizing agents (hydrogen peroxide, lead oxide, chromium oxide) to afford the TPM colorant. Variations in the substitution patterns on either the aldehyde or the coupler molecules can change slightly the wavelength of light absorbed, thus providing a different color to the colorant species.   The substitution of groups in this manner is highly unpredictable.  A large amount of effort may be expended to find the right molecular combination to provide the most appropriate color shade for a given application.<br>
[0004] One problem with TPM colorants is inadvertent or undesirable discoloration.   This may occur if an undesirable chemical reaction occurs to the colorant molecular species.    In the case of TPM based colorants, nucleophilic<br>
groups such as OH- or certain basic amine groups may react with and undesirably decolorize or shift the shade of such colorants.   It is known that at elevated pH levels, TPM based colorants are subject to hydroxyl (OH-) attack. These reactions may undesirably decolorize or change the shade of the colorant molecule.   Thus, it would be highly desirable to develop compositions, methods, or techniques that could be used for affording color in such product applications while providing a high level of stability in alkaline environments as well.   This ensures that adequate color remains, even under alkaline conditions.<br>
[0005] Discoloration of TPM colorants and or dyes has been addressed in a number of patents, some of which are discussed below.<br>
[0006]The Ragsdale patent (United States Patent No. 6,395,797), discloses organic cyclic ester additives formulated with TPM colorants to reduce color degradation in polyurethane foam systems caused by certain tertiary amine catalyst.<br>
[0007] In Harris (United States Patent No. 6,342,618), TPM colorants containing sterically hindered fugitive amine counterions employed to improve stability of such colorants in inks. The Triphenylmethane polymeric colorants are capped with a cyclic anhydride.   The Sterically hindered amine counter ions are those based on low molecuter weight fugitive tertiary amines, such as N,N-dimethylethanolamine.<br>
[0008] United States Patent No. 3,927,044 (Foster et al.) discloses alkaline stable fugitive tints prepared using aromatic aldehydes containing an electron-withdrawing group (X) in the ortho-position. These fugitive tints are prepared with highly ethoxylated aromatic amines.   The tints are said to exhibit improved lightfastness and provide some degree of alkaline stability.<br><br>
(Figure Removed) <br><br>
Stability is defined in this Foster patent disclosure as the ability to retain color in an alkaline solution at a pH level of 11.   The X in the structure represents the electron-withdrawing group in the ortho position and may include halogen, nitro, or sulfonyl radicals.<br>
[0009] United States Patent Publication No. 2004/0143910 A1 discloses the use of certain triphenylmethane dyes as hair colorants, which are resistant to decolorization in alkaline bleach medium. This patent teaches that TPM dyes containing deactivating (electron withdrawing) or weakly activating groups substituted at the ortho- and/or para- positions relative to the central methane carbon and/or auxochrome groups (located on or attached to the aromatic rings of the TPM) have enhanced survival in alkaline bleach medium. As more and more groups are added to the rings, stability increases proportionally, so that dyes with the most substituents on all three aromatic rings are the most stable. These deactivating and protective groups may be nitro, halogen, cyano, carboxyl, sulfonic, alkyl, or aromatic groups, but not amino, hydroxy, alkoxy or alkylamide groups. In this patent auxochromes are defined as weakly basic groups such as hydroxy or amino groups. If the auxochrome is an amino group, it may be a primary amino group (-NH2), a secondary amino group (-NHR1), or a tertiary amino group (-NR2) where R1 and R2 may be identical or different, and either may be alkyl, alkoxy, carboxy, cyano, alkyl cyano, halogen, phenyl, or naphthyl substituent.<br>
[0010] United States Patent No. 4,595,536 (Hung et al) discloses TPM dyes of the structure shown below.<br>
(Figure Removed) <br><br>
[0011] These dyes are reported to be resistant or stable enough to sanitizing agents, which produce hypochlorite in aqueous solutions, that they can be used in automatic toilet bowl sanitizers. In this patent disclosure, X represents hydrogen or hydroxy. M represents an alkali metal cation, an ammonium ion, or an alkaline earth metal cation.<br>
[0012] An additional patent by Hung et al, United States Patent No. 4,632,783 discloses TPM dyes of the structure shown below.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
[0013] These dyes are reported to be resistant or stable enough to serve as sanitizing agents, which produce hypochlorite in aqueous solutions.   They can be used in automatic toilet bowl sanitizers. In this patent, X represents hydrogen or the group SO3M. Y represents hydrogen or hydroxy. M represents an alkali metal cation, an ammonium cation, or an alkaline earth metal cation.<br>
[0014] United States Patent No. 2004/0214918 A1 (Banning et al.) is directed to colorant compositions having aromatic ring structures with an attached nitrogen, in which the nitrogen is substituted with an R group, and also with an alkylene oxide containing structure.   The R group may be alkyl, aryl, arylalkyi or an alkylaryl group.    Further, the R group may be joined to the phenyl moiety to form a bicylic structure.   The overall triphenyl-based structure proposed in this patent contains one alkylene oxide chain (CnH2nO)xH attached to the nitrogen. This alkylene oxide chain is derived from its presence on the aromatic aldehyde that is reacted two other phenyls to form the triphenyl-based structure.   The non-ring based carbon of the aromatic aldehyde group forms the central carbon of the triphenylamine-based structure that is formed.<br>
[0016] United States Patent No. 5,591,833 to Hines et al is directed to fugitive tint materials that are more easily removed from yarns without scouring<br>
[0015] Shikhaliev et al (Khimiya I Khimicheskaya Tekhnologiya, 1999, Vol. 42, No. 4, pp 83-87) reported the preparation and spectral properties of the following TPM dyes of the structure shown below where RI is H or NMe2 and R is H or Me.<br><br>

 the yarns.   The Mines patent discloses colorants and compositions useful as fugitive or permanent colorants for a variety of substrates, and having one or more improved properties, such as: enhanced aqueous washability, reduced staining, compatibility with and non-extractability from thermoplastic resins, and reactivity with resins having reactive functionality.<br>
[0017] The compositions disclosed in Examples 63, 64, and 65 of the<br>
Hines patent incorporate long chain ethylene oxide (EO) residues containing at<br>
least two glycidols (denoted "GL" in the patent) attached to nitrogen.    Example<br>
63 contains two "H-50 EO/2GL-" groups, while Examples 64 and 65 disclose two<br>
"H-10 EO/2GL-" and two "H-50EO/2GL-" groups, respectively, attached to<br>
separate nitrogens annexed to a triphenylmethane-based compound. Hines<br>
discloses using between 2 and 6 glycidol residues attached to a nucleophilic<br>
site.	<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[0018] Reference now will be made to the embodiments of the invention, one or more examples of which are set forth below. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the invention, not as a limitation of the invention. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in this invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention.<br>
[0019] In the practice of the invention, novel chemical compositions and methods of applying such chemical compositions are provided.    A TPM-based colorant is provided that is stable in alkaline detergent systems as well as polyurethane systems that employ basic catalysts, including polyurethane foams. The colorant compositions of the invention are useful in polyolefins, such as polypropylene and polyethylene, as examples.   These colorant compositions also may be employed in thermoplastics, such as PET, for example.<br>
[0020] TPM based compositions of the invention employ a coupler wherein the nitrogen atom of the aromatic amine is substituted with hindered<br>
glycidyl ethers such as tert-butyl glycidyl ether, isopropyl-glycidyl ether, isobutyl glycidyl ether, hexadecyl glycidyl ether, glycidyl methyl ether, 2-ethylhexyl glycidyl ether, or hindered epoxides such as styrene oxide. By using a coupler wherein this nitrogen is substituted by sterically bulky glycidyl ethers or epoxides, the likelihood that the TPM colorant will undergo decolorization due to attack by a nucleophile (such as OH- or an amin) is reduced dramatically and the stability of the colorant is improved. This is an uenexpected and significant discovery.<br>
[0021] The use of couplers or aldehydes containing groups that increase the steric hinderance in and around the central carbon of the TPM based structure can also be employed in conjunction with the coupling components containing the sterically hindered aromatic amine nitrogen.   Such additional steric hindrance can improve the stability further, but is not always necessary.<br>
[0022] The use of aromatic aldehydes containing para-substituted amines may also be incorporated into the TPM composition. This, in general, allows one to obtain more violet to red shades bf blue   The amine on the aldehyde component is substituted with alkylene oxide residues consisting of either propylene oxide, butylene oxide, styrene oxide, t-butyl glycidyl ether, isopropyl glycidyl ether, isobutyl glycidyl ether, 2-ethylhexyl glycidyl ether, glycidyl hexadecyl ether, glycidyl methyl ether or mixtures thereof.<br>
[0023] The amine on the aldehyde optionally may be incorporated into a heterocycle as in the case of the structure shown below. In this case the amine is additionally substituted with an alkyl group or styrene oxide, t-butyl glycidyl ether, isopropyl glycidyl ether, isobutyl glycidyl ether, 2-ethylhexyl glycidyl ether, glycidyl hexadecyl ether, or glycidyl methyl ether.<br>

[0056] Acid Violet 17 (Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis.) will be used in stability test as comparative example E.<br>
(Figure Removed) [0057] In order to test the improved stability of the inventive colorants to basic amine catalyst in polyurethane foam, the following test was performed using the colorants described above. These inventive colorants were tested against comparative example A prepared using coupling components containing ethylene oxide residues attached directly to the nitrogen of the coupler.<br>
[0058] In these tests, the TPM colorants were mixed with other poly-(oxyalkylene) colorants which are stable to basic amine catalyst. This allows one to more easily see changes in the actual foam shade. This also provides a reference point from which to determine the actual percentage of colorant lost during the test. Black colorant blends were prepared by mixing equal amounts of Reactint® Red X64 and Reactint® Yellow X15 (available from Milliken Chemical, Spartanburg, South Carolina) with inventive examples 1-2.<br>
[0059] In order to correct for varying color strengths, the colorants 1-2 were all cut to a consistent color value of 25 (abs/g/L in Methanol) with a polyester polyol diluent (Fomrez 11-225.TM. from Witco) prior to mixing with<br>
Reactint® Red X64 and Reactint® Yellow XI5 referenced above. This was accomplished as follows.<br>
[0060] First the color value for the colorants tested was determined by placing 0.15-0.20 grams of colorant into a 100 mL volumetric flask and adding approximately 40-50 ml of methanol. The flask was swirled until the colorant dissolved in the methanol, after which excess methanol was added to the 100 mL mark on the flask. The flask was stoppered and the contents were mixed and shaken. Exactly 2.0 mL of the solution of the colorant in methanol was then added to a separate 100 mL flask and the flask was filled with methanol to the 100 mL mark, stoppered and shaken.<br>
[0061] A Beckman DU-650 Spectrophotometer was zeroed with methanol, filled with the test solution, and the solution was scanned from 300 to 750 mm. The maximum absorbance was recorded, the color value was obtained by multiplying the sample weight by 0.2 and dividing the result into the maximum absorbance value.<br>
[0062] Standard polyurethane foams (to be used as reference foams) were prepared using the following procedure: Two parts of a colorant blend were added to 100 parts of ether triol (mw-3,000), which was mixed with 4.53 parts water, 1.0 part silicone surfactant, 0.15 parts stannous octoate catalyst (Dabco 33LV) and 0.60 parts triethylene diamine. Next, 58.8 parts toluene diisocyanate (80/20) was allowed to react at ambient conditions for approximately three minutes and allowed to cool. The foams were then cured in a microwave at 10% power for 10 minutes then in a 160 C oven for 3 minutes. A<br>
colored polyurethane foam having a density of 1.5 Ibs./ft3 was produced.<br>
[0063] Test foams were made using the procedure described above except that the triethylamine diamine was replaced with either DABCO TL, DMEA, or ZF10. After the foams had cooled to room temperature, they were cut and an K/S spectral curve of the color of the center of the foam measured using a Hunter Color Computer. This spectra was compared to the K/S spectra from the center of the bun prepared using the same black colorant blend with triethylene diamine catalyst. By comparing the ratio of peak heights of the Blue peaks to that of the Red peaks in the foams for the standard catalyst (triethylene diamine) and the more basic amine catalyst; the % color loss can be determined. The results are shown in Table 2.<br>
TABLE 1:  COLORANT STABILITY TEST IN POLYURETHANE FOAM<br><br>
(Table Removed 1) [0064] From the results in TABLE 1, it can be seen that the inventive colorants 1 &amp; 2, showed a dramatic reduction in the amount of color lost in the presence of the highly basic amine catalyst compared to an analogous TPM colorant, comparative example A, containing EO directly bound to the amine nitrogen of the coupler. The amount of improvement varies depending on the catalyst used.<br><br>
TABLE 2.   COLORANT STABILITY ON LAUNDRY DETERGENTS<br><br>
(Table Removed 2) [0065] From the results in TABLE 2, it can be seen that the inventive colorants (Examples 3-6) showed a significant and unexpected reduction in the amount of color lost on detergent compared to the comparative TPM colorants, Examples B-E. These dramatic improvements indeed are surprising — and unexpected.<br>
