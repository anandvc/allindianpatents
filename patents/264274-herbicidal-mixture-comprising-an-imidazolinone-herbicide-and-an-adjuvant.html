				<td>Herbicidal mixture, comprising an imidazolinone herbicide and an adjuvant<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to a herbicidal mixture of an imidazolinone herbicide and<br>
an adjuvant.<br>
The imidazolinone herbicides of the present invention encompass: imazamox, ima-<br>
zapic, imazapyr, all of those are further specified in e.g. C.D.S. Tomlin, "The Pesticide<br>
Manual", 13th Edition, BCPC (2003), Index 5,1337-1344 and<br>
http://www.hclrss.demon.co.uk/index_cn_frame.html.<br>
Refering to imidazolinone herbicides or specific imidazolinone herbicide species in this<br>
application shall mean the compounds as mentioned above, as well as their a) salts,<br>
e.g. salts of alkaline or earth alkaline metals or ammonium or organoammonium salts,<br>
for instance, sodium, potasium, ammonium, preferably isopropyl ammonium etc.; b)<br>
respective isomers, e.g. stereo isomers such as the respective enantiomers, in particular<br>
 the respective R-or S-enantiomers (including salts, ester, amides), c) respective<br>
esters, e.g. carboxylic acid C1-C8-(branched or non-branched) alkyl esters, such as<br>
methyl esters, ethyl esters, iso propyl esters, d) respective amides, e.g. carboxylic acid<br>
amides or carboxylic acid C1-C8-(branched or non-branched) mono or di alkyl amides,<br>
such as dimethylamides, diethylamides, di isopropyl amides or e) any other derivative<br>
which contains the above imidazolinone structures as structural moiety.<br>
In particular the term imidazolinone herbicide or reference to specific imidazolinone<br>
herbicides herein, such as, imazamox, imazapic, imazapyr, shall include alkylammonium <br>
salts, preferably isopropylammonium salts, for example diisopropylammonium- or<br>
monoisopropylammonium salts.<br>
Further suitable imidazolinone herbicides are the R-isomers, e.g. R-imazamox , R-<br>
imazapic, R-imazapyr, in particular R-imazapyr. These compounds are known e.g. from<br>
US 5,973,154 B (American Cyanamid Company) and US 6,339,158 B1 (American Cy-<br>
anamid Company).<br>
EP 0 356 812 A2 discloses tank-mix compositions of certain herbicides, including<br>
imazaquin and imazethapyr, with low foaming nonionic alkylpolyoxyalkylene polyethers<br>
and for example anionic surfactants such as partial phosphate esters of monohydroxy-<br>
functional polyoxyalkylene ethers.<br>
EP 0 356 812 A is silent as to weed control in the presence of trees.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a herbicidal mixture which comprises<br>
herbicidal mixtures of an imidazolinone herbicide and an adjuvant and whose herbicidal<br><br>
activity is higher than the activity of the pure active compound.<br>
This object was achieved by a herbicidal mixture, comprising<br>
a)	a herbicidally effective amount of an imidazolinone herbicide selected from the<br>
group consisting of imazamox, imazapic, imazapyr,<br>
b)	an adjuvant comprising at least one of the following components: a partial<br>
phosphoric ester or a partial sulfuric ester of a monohydroxy-functional polyalkyl<br>
ether<br>
and optionally<br>
c)	further additives.<br>
The herbicidal mixture according to the invention displays a synergistic effect and is<br>
selective for those crop plants which are also compatible with the individual<br>
compounds.<br>
Suitable adjuvants b) comprise partial phosphoric ester or partial sulfuric ester of a<br>
monohydroxy-functional polyalkyl ether.<br>
These partial esters are prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art, for<br>
example by reacting one of the well known and commercially monohydric<br>
polyoxyalkylene ethers with sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid or their chemical<br>
equivalents. The sulfate ester so obtained consist predominantly of the half ester<br>
(mono ester) while the phosphate esters generally contain both, mono- and diesters.<br>
Also usefull are the simple salts of these surfactants, for example, the alkali metal,<br>
alkaline earth metal or ammonium salts.The sulfate esters may be prepared for<br>
example by reacting a suitable mono-functional polyoxyalkylene ether with sulfuric acid<br>
or its chemical equivalent, preferably sulfamic acid or sulfurtrioxide. Phosphate esters<br>
are described, for example, in US 5,877,112 column 2, lines 32 to 67 (included herein<br>
by reference) and may be prepared, for example, by reaction of the monofunctional<br>
polyoxyalkylene ether with phosphoric acid, diphosphorus pentoxide, polyphosphoric<br>
acid or phosphorus oxytrichloride. Methods of preparation are described in the treatise<br>
"Nonionic Surfactants", Martin Schick, Ed., Marcel Dekker, New York, 1967, chapter<br>
11, pages 372-394.<br>
Suitable partial phosphoric esters and partial sulfuric esters of a monohydroxy-<br>
functional polyalkylene ethers are those whose polyalkylene ether radicals can be<br>
prepared by oxalkylation of long-chain alcohols such as C10-C20-alkanols, preferably<br>
C10-C16-alkanols, with alkylene oxides such as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide or<br><br>
butylene oxide. The alkylene oxides can be employed as a mixture, or else<br>
successively, for preparing block copolymers.<br>
Preference is given to polyaikylene ethers having a C10-C16-alkyl chain with 10 to 15<br>
mol of ethylene oxide units and 1 to 10, preferably 2 to 6 mol of propylene oxide units.<br>
Preferred products are Klearfac™ AA 270 of BASF Corporation and Lutensit ® A-EP<br>
from BASF Aktiengesellschaft.<br>
The herbicidal mixture according to the invention comprises the components a) and b)<br>
in the following amounts (by weight-%):1 to 99 % by weight of the component a) and 1<br>
to 99 % by weight of the component b). Preferred ratios are: 20 to 80 % by weight of<br>
the component a) and 20 to 80 % by weight of the component b). Very preferred ratios<br>
are: 45 to 55 % by weight of the component a) and 45 to 55 % by weight of the<br>
component b). Here, the components together are 100% by weight.<br>
In addition to component b), further additives c) can be used, alone or in combination,<br>
for example:<br>
C1) castor oil based surfactant. This is a triglyceride ethoxylates - nonionic surfactant.<br>
Ethoxyiated triglycerides are nonionic polyoxyethylene surfactants usually prepared by<br>
the condensation or addition of ethylene oxide to a hydrophobic compound, castor oil.<br>
Castor oil is a triglyceride (ester) of fatty acids with the approximate composition of 90<br>
% ricinoleic acid, an 18-carbon acid having a double bond in the 9-10 position and the<br>
hydroxyl group on the 12th carbon. The remaining 10 % consists of linoleic, oleic,<br>
stearic, palmitic, dihydroxystearic, linolenic and eicosanoic acids;<br>
c2) alkyl polyoxyalkylene polyethers. These compounds are known and many are<br>
commercially obtainable. These compounds are described, for example, in US<br>
5,238,604, col. 2, lines 43 to 68. Suitable alkyl polyoxyalkylene polyethers are those<br>
which can be prepared by oxalkylation of C10-C25-alkanols with alkylene oxides such<br>
as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide or butylene oxide. Preference is given to alkyl<br>
polyoxyalkylene polyethers having a C10-C25-alkyl chain, preferably C12-C20-alkyl<br>
chain, with an EO/PO block copolymer, such as, for example, Plurafac® LF, BASF AG,<br>
Plurafac RA 20® (BASF Aktiengesellschaft) and in particular Pluraflo L1060® (BASF<br>
Corpora tionn).<br>
The present invention also extends to herbicidal compositions which comprise the<br>
components a) and b), optionally c), at least one liquid and/or solid carrier and, if desired,<br>
 at least one further additive d).<br><br>
Said herbicidal compositions can be a herbicidal finished formulation, preferably a<br>
herbicidal finished liquid formulation, most preferably a herbicidal finished aqueous<br>
liquid formulation.<br>
However, these herbicidal compositions can also be tank-mixes which are made from<br>
the herbicidal mixture according to the invention or preferably from the herbicidal<br>
finished formulation according to the invention.<br>
Such a tank mix is usually obtained by diluting the pre-mixed herbicidal mixture a) plus<br>
b) and optionally c) or preferably by diluting the finished formulation according to the<br>
invention, usually with water. Optionally further additives d) may be added before or<br>
after the mixing or dilution step.<br>
Examples and brands of further additives d) are described in Farm Chemicals<br>
Handbook 1997; Meister Publishing 1997 p. C10 "adjuvant" or 1998 Weed Control<br>
Manual p. 86.<br>
Preferably the tank-mix is prepared shortly before the application of the herbicidal<br>
composition.<br>
A preferred further additive d) is methylated seed oil, such as methyl caprylate-caprate,<br>
methyl laurate, methyl myristate, methyl palmitate, methyl stearate, methyl oleate,<br>
methyl coconate, methyl sunflowerate, methyl canolate, and methyl soyate, in<br>
particular the one with the trade name Sunit II The methylated seed oils are known in<br>
the art and for example described in Fourth International Symposium on Adjuvants For<br>
Agrochemicals, Melbourne Australia, 1995, organized by The Counsel of Australian<br>
Weed Science Societies, Edited by Robyn E. Gaskin.<br>
Methyl esters are usually produced by transesterification process: a natural fat (animal<br>
derived) or oil (vegetable derived) is combined with catalyst and methanol to yield, after<br>
refining, the whole methyl ester and a glycerine co-product. The whole methyl ester<br>
contains esters of all the fatty acids present in the fat or oil. It can be used as such or<br>
may be fractionally distlled into its components. Methylated seed oils are either<br>
saturated or unsaturated esters. The saturated esters range usually from C6 (caproate)<br>
to C18 (stearate), the unsaturated esters range usually from C14 (myristoleate) to C18<br>
(linolenate).<br>
Sunit II™ is a combination of methyl esters primarily methyl oleate with a proprietary<br>
nonionic surfactant.<br>
The methylated seed oil can be added in amounts (all weight-%) from 0.5 % to 50 %<br>
preferably 1 % to<br>
20 %, most preferably 1 % to 10 %, very most preferably 0,5 % to 5 %, all of those<br>
referring to % of adjuvant in water.<br><br>
A herbicidal finished formulation according to the invention does include directly<br>
sprayable aqueous solutions, suspensions, highly-concentrated aqueous, oily or other<br>
suspensions or dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, materials for spreading,<br>
which can be applied by means of spraying, atomizing, spreading or pouring.<br>
Suitable inert additives (auxiliaries), for example mineral oil fractions of medium to high<br>
boiling point such as kerosene and diesel oil, furthermore coal tar oils and oils of<br>
vegetable or animal origin, aliphatic, cyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. paraffins,<br>
tetrahydronaphthalene, alkylated naphthalenes and their derivatives, alkylated<br>
benzenes and their derivatives, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol<br>
and cyclohexanol, ketones such as cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, such as N-<br>
methylpyrrolidone and preferably water.<br>
Aqueous use forms can be prepared from emulsion concentrates, suspensions, pastes,<br>
by adding water. To prepare emulsions, pastes or oil dispersions, the substances, as<br>
such or dissolved in an oil or solvent, can be homogenized in water by means of wet-<br>
ting agent, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier. However, it is also possible to prepare<br>
concentrates composed of active substance, wetting agent, tackifier, dispersant or<br>
emulsifier and, if appropriate, solvent or oil, and these concentrates are suitable for<br>
dilution with water.<br>
The concentrations of the herbicidal mixture a) and b) according to the invention in the<br>
herbicidal finished formulations can be varied within wide ranges. In general, the herbi-<br>
cidal finished formulations comprise from 0.01 % to 95 % by weight, preferably 0.5 % to<br>
90 % by weight, very preferably 45 % to 55 % by weight of the herbicidal mixture a)<br>
and b) according to the invention.<br>
A suitable herbicidal finished formulation according to the invention does in addition to<br>
the herbicidal mixture a) and b) comprise water.<br>
Another suitable herbicidal finished formulation according to the invention does in addi-<br>
tion to the herbicidal mixture a) and b) comprise water and an antifreeze agent. Anti-<br>
freeze agents are known in the art and include for example isopropylglycol, diisopropyl<br>
glycol, ethylene glycol.<br>
Another suitable herbicidal finished formulation according to the invention does in addi-<br>
tion to the herbicidal mixture a) and b) comprise water and an antifreeze agent, and the<br>
component a) being imazapyr, imazamox, imazapic or mixtures of those imidazolinone<br>
herbicides and the component b) being a partial phosphoric ester of a monohydroxy-<br>
functional polyalkyl ether, for example Klearfac® AA 270, a product of BASF Corpora-<br>
tion, with or without alkyl polyoxyalkylene polyether.<br><br>
A preferable herbicidal finished formulation according to the invention does in addition<br>
to the herbicidal mixture a) and b) comprise water and an antifreeze agent, and the<br>
component a) being imazapyr, imazamox or mixtures of those imidazolinone herbicides<br>
and the component b) being a partial phosphoric ester of a monohydroxy-functional<br>
polyalkyl ether, for example Klearfac® AA 270, a product of BASF Corporation, with or<br>
without alkyl polyoxyalkylene polyether.<br>
Another preferable herbicidal finished formulation according to the invention does in<br>
addition to the herbicidal mixture a) and b) comprise water and an antifreeze agent,<br>
and the component a) being imazapyr and the component b) being a partial phosphoric<br>
ester of a monohydroxy-functional polyalkyl ether, for example Klearfac® AA 270, a<br>
product of BASF Corporation, with or without alkyl polyoxyalkylene polyether.<br>
A very preferable herbicidal finished formulation according to the invention does in ad-<br>
dition to the herbicidal mixture a) and b) comprise water and an antifreeze agent, and<br>
the component a) being imazapyr, imazamox, or mixtures of those imidazolinone her-<br>
bicides and the component b) being a partial phosphoric ester of a monohydroxy-<br>
functional polyalkyl ether, for example Klearfac® AA 270, a product of BASF Corpora-<br>
tion, wherein the components are contained in the following amounts, weight-% refer-<br>
ing to the herbicidal finished formulation:<br>
a) Imazapyr from 5 % to 40 %, preferably 10% to 20%; b) a partial phosphoric ester of<br>
a monohydroxy-functional polyalkyl ether, for example Klearfac® AA 270, a product of<br>
BASF Corporation from 5 % to 50 %, preferably 15 % to 25%; and antifreeze agent:<br>
from 1 % to 10 %, preferably 1 % to 5%; and water of the amount, which sums up to<br>
100 %.<br>
The herbicidal finished formulation according to the invention does usually have a pH<br>
value in range from 6.0 to 8.0, in particular of from 6.8 to 7.2.<br>
A big advantage of the herbicidal finished formulation according to the invention in<br>
which the imidazolinone herbicide is present in form of its salts, preferably of its ammo-<br>
nium salts and in particular of its monoisopropyl ammonium salt is that it does not need<br>
additional acid to buffer the formulation.<br>
The herbicidal finished formulation according to the invention is generally prepared<br>
according to methods known in the art for the specific type of said formulations, see for<br>
example Surfactants &amp; Specialities for Plant Protection Rhone-Poulenc (now Rhodia)<br>
3rd edition, 1994.<br>
An example for a good method for the preparation of an aqueous herbicidal finished<br>
formulation according to the invention is as follows:<br>
Usually about 90% of the total amount of water is added to the reactor vessel (about<br><br>
10 % is used at the end for active ingredient adjustment), then an amine, for example,<br>
mono-isopropylamine is added to the reactor containing water, then the component a),<br>
for example imazapyr or imazamox is added to the reactor and blended until the reaction<br>
 with the amine is complete, then the anti-freeze agent, for example, propylene glycol<br>
 is added to the reactor and blended, then the additive b), for example Klearfac® AA<br>
270 is slowly added to the reactor and blended until the pH is adjusted to 6.8 to 7.2.<br>
The batch is analyzed and the remaining water is added to achieve the active ingredient<br>
 content of for example, 22.0 %. All steps are usually conducted by a temperature of<br>
20 to 25 °C, if necessary by cooling the reaction vessel.<br>
The components a) and b) are usually applied to the plants, their environment and/or<br>
seeds jointly. It is preferable to apply the active ingredients simultaneously. However, it<br>
is also possible to apply them separately.<br>
The components a) and b) can be applied by using a herbicidal finished formulation or<br>
a tank-mix prepared as described above, preferably by using a herbicidal finished formulation.<br><br>
Moreover, it may be advantageous to apply the herbicidal mixtures, herbicidal finished<br>
formulations or herbicidal compositions according to the invention with additional other<br>
crop protection agents, for example with pesticides or agents for controlling phytopa-<br>
thogenic fungi or bacteria. Also of interest is the miscibility with mineral salt solutions<br>
which are employed for treating nutritional and trace element deficiencies. Non-<br>
phytotoxic oils and oil concentrates can also be added, as described above.<br>
The herbicidal mixtures, herbicidal finished formulations or herbicidal compositions<br>
according to the invention, can be employed, for example, in the form of directly sprayable<br>
 aqueous solutions, suspensions, also highly-concentrated aqueous, oily or other<br>
suspensions or dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, materials for spreading<br>
or, by means of spraying, atomizing, spreading or pouring. Preferred is the application<br>
of directly spray able aqueous solutions.<br>
The use forms depend on the intended purposes; in any case, they should guarantee<br>
the finest possible distribution of the active ingredients according to the invention.<br>
The herbicidal mixtures, herbicidal finished formulations or herbicidal compositions<br>
according to the invention can be applied pre- or post-emergence. It is advantageous<br>
to apply the herbicidal mixtures, herbicidal finished formulations or herbicidal compositions<br>
 according to the invention post emergent when the crop has in general 1 to 6<br>
leaves.<br>
If the imidazolinone herbicide active ingredients are less well tolerated by certain crop<br><br>
plants, application techniques may be used in which the herbicidal compositions are<br>
sprayed, with the aid of the spray apparatus, in such a way that they come into as little<br>
contact, if any, with the leaves of the sensitive crop plants while reaching the leaves of<br>
undesirable plants which grow underneath, or the bare soil (post-directed, lay-by).<br>
In the case of a post-emergence treatment of the plants, the herbicidal mixtures, herbicidal<br>
 finished formulations or herbicidal compositions according to the invention are<br>
preferably applied by foliar application. Application may be effected, for example, by<br>
usual spraying techniques with water as the carrier, using amounts of spray mixture of<br>
approx. 47 to 473 l/ha. The mixtures or compositions may also be applied by the so-<br>
called "low-volume" and "ultra-low-volume" methods.<br>
The rate of application of pure active ingredient a), i.e. without formulation auxiliaries,<br>
amounts in general to 0.1 to 2000 g/ha, preferably 1 to 1500 g/ha, in particular 5 to<br>
1000 g/ha, of active substance (a.s.), depending on the intended aim, the season, the<br>
target plants and growth stage.<br>
The herbicidal mixtures, herbicidal finished formulations or herbicidal compositions<br>
according to the invention can effect very good control of grass weeds and broadleaf<br>
weeds in many crops without damaging the crop plants, an effect observed especially<br>
at low rates of application.<br>
Suitable crops are for example maize, brassica napus (canola, oilseed rape), sun-<br>
flower, legumes, sugar cane, and soya, or cereals (for example wheat, rye).<br>
The herbicidal mixtures, herbicidal finished formulations or herbicidal compositions<br>
according to the invention can advantageously been used to very good control<br>
undesired vegetation in non-crop areas such as roads, railroads, turf, utility lines, and<br>
in particular in areas in which trees are present. The herbicidal mixtures, herbicidal<br>
finished formulations or herbicidal compositions according to the invention are<br>
preferably used in forestry.<br>
Undesired vegetation in non-crop areas which is controlled by the herbicidal mixtures,<br>
herbicidal finished formulations or herbicidal compositions according to the invention<br>
does include the following grasses of Table 1<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Examples<br>
Imazapyr Uptake and Translocation<br>
The enhanced herbicidal effect is directly correlated to the uptake and the translocation<br>
of the herbicidal mixture according to the invention in plants<br>
In the following experiments the uptake was tested, v/v means volume by volume. ARSENAL®<br>
 and CHOPPER® are Tradenames of BASF Corporation. MSO means methylated<br>
 seed oil.<br>
Example I.<br>
METHODOLOGY<br>
Arsenal AC Soluble Liquid (SL) herbicide was combined with different surfactants at<br>
two rates (0.25% and 2% v/v) and compared to Arsenal AC and Chopper Soluble Liquid<br>
 (SL) herbicide without surfactant or with 12.5% MSO.<br>
Arsenal AC is a surfactant free formulation of imazapyr containing 0.48 kg ai/l I.<br>
Chopper contains an emulsifier and 0.24 kg ai imazapyr per liter.<br>
MSO is approximately 0.85 kg/I seed oil and 0.15 kg/I nonionic surfactant.<br>
Rates used were 0.71 I Arsenal AC and 1.42 I Chopper, equivalent to 0.84 kg imazapyr<br>
per hectare.<br>
The surfactants are: PLURAFLO® L-1060 or KLEARFAC® AA-270<br><br>
Treatments were applied to water oak (Quercus nigra). Water oak is a relatively hard to<br>
control species.<br>
Plants were presprayed with cold formulations at 24 gram per hectare within a few<br>
hours of radiotracer application. Once the pre-spray dried, two of the uppermost fully<br>
expanded leaves received 2.4 µl of radiolabeled formulation. One hour after application<br>
(HAT), one treated leaf was removed and washed with 3- 5ml distilled water rinses,<br>
with a 5ml funnel rinse collected in the same vial. The washed treated leaf was then<br>
bagged and frozen for later oxidation. One week after treatment (WAT) the final harves<br>
began with removal and water washing of the remaining treated leaf (same as HAT<br>
leaf). The plant was clipped at the root collar and the above ground portion oven dried<br>
(stem). The roots were washed of potting soil and oven dried. Once dried, the above-<br>
and below- ground plant portions were ground in a coffee mill and subsampled.<br>
The water wash was analyzed using a 1 ml aliquot combined with Scintiverse II liquid<br>
scintillation cocktail, counted on a Packard Tri Carb 2900 TR Liquid Scintillation<br>
Counter (LSC). The treated leaves were oxidized in an OX-500 Harvey Biological Oxidizer,<br>
 which converts carbon-14 to CO2 in liquid to be counted on the LSC. The stem<br>
and root subsamples were also oxidized on the OX-500 and counted.<br>
Imazapyr Uptake and Translocation Results<br><br>
Imazapyr Uptake. Numbers in the table above are the percent of applied imazapyr.<br>
Washoff numbers are for the one week after treatment assessment.<br>
Conclusion<br>
Phosphate esters reduce the washoff while increasing the root+stem and leaf concentration<br>
 of imazapyr. Improved Root+ Stem and Leaf uptake are noted with increased<br>
rate of KLEARFAC® AA-270.<br><br><br>
*Washoff, Root+Stem and Leaf numbers are for the one week after treatment assessment.<br><br>
Conclusions:<br>
Phosphate esters and blends with Pluronic type surfactants reduce the washout while<br>
increasing the root+stem and leaf concentration of imazapyr.<br>
A blend of Pluraflo 1060 and Klearfac AA 270 provides increased uptake. For example,<br>
in the wash off, root+stem, and leaf improve with increased concentration of the adjuvant.<br>
Example II. Imazapyr Absorption:<br>
METHODOLOGY<br>
Arsenal® AC herbicide was combined with different surfactants at one rate (50% v/v),<br>
alone and with 1.0% v/v MSO. This was compared to Chopper® herbicide without surfactant<br>
 alone and with 1.0% v/v MSO.<br>
Arsenal AC is a surfactant free formulation of imazapyr containing 0.48 kg/I.<br>
Chopper contains an emulsifier and 0.24 kg/I imazapyr per gallon.<br>
MSO is approximately 0.85 kg/I seed oil and 0.15 kg/I nonionic surfactant.<br>
The absorption was measured by the relative percent of injury compared to Chopper<br>
alone and with MSO. Rates used were 320 g active ingredient/ha. Treatments were<br>
applied to imi-tolerant sunflowers, a relatively hard to control species. The surfactants<br>
are listed below:<br><br><br><br>
