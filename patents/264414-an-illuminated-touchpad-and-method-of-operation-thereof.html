				<td>ILLUMINATED TOUCHPAD<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates generally to touch pads that provide visual<br>
feedback. More particularly, the present invention relates to illuminated touch pads<br>
that use light to provide feedback.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
[0002] There exist today many styles of input devices for performing operations in a<br>
computer system. The operations generally correspond to moving a cursor and/or<br>
making selections on a display screen. By way of example, the input devices may<br>
include buttons or keys, mice, trackballs, touch pads, joy sticks, touch screens and the<br>
like.<br>
[0003] Touch pads, in particular, are becoming increasingly popular because of their<br>
ease and versatility of operation as well as to their declining price. Touch pads allow<br>
a user to make selections and move a cursor by simply touching an input surface via a<br>
finger or stylus. In general, the touch pad recognizes the touch and position of the<br>
touch on the input surface and the computer system interprets the touch and thereafter<br>
performs an action based on the touch event.<br>
[0004] Touch pads typically include an opaque touch panel, a controller and a<br>
software driver. The touch panel registers touch events and sends these signals to the<br>
controller. The controller processes these signals and sends the data to the computer<br>
system. The software driver translates the touch events into computer events.<br>
[0005] Although touch pads work well, improvements to their form feel and<br>
functionality are desired. By way of example, it may be desirable to provide visual<br>
stimuli at the touch pad so that a user can better operate the touch pad. For example,<br>
the visual stimuli may be used (among others) to alert a user when the touch pad is<br>
registering; a touch, alert a user where the touch is occurring on the touch pad, provide<br>
feedback related to the touch event, indicate the state of the touch pad, and/or the like.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] The invention relates, in one embodiment, to an illuminated input device. The<br>
illuminated input device includes an object sensing mechanism capable of sensing a<br><br>
user input over an input surface. The illuminated input device also includes a visual<br>
feedback system configured to illuminate the input surface in association with a user<br>
input.<br>
[0007] The invention relates, in another embodiment, to a method of operating an<br>
input device. The method includes sensing an object over an input surface. The<br>
method also includes and illuminating at least a portion of the input surface when an<br>
object is sensed.<br>
[0008] The invention relates, in another embodiment, to a method of operating an<br>
input device. The method includes illuminating at least a portion of an input surface<br>
when an object is detected over the input surface. The method also includes adjusting<br>
the illumination when the object is moved over the input surface.<br>
[0009] The invention relates, in another embodiment, to a method of operating an<br>
input device. The method includes detecting a user input over the input surface. The<br>
method also includes determining an input state of the input device based on the user<br>
input. The method additionally includes illuminating the input surface based on the<br>
input state of the input device. Each input state having a different illumination<br>
profile.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0043] The present invention pertains to improved feedback mechanisms for touch<br>
pads. One aspect relates to devices capable of illuminating the touch sensitive surface<br>
of the touch pad. Not just in backlighting so that the user knows where the touchpad<br>
is located in low light conditions, but also to give other feedback related to how the<br>
touch pad is being used. Another aspect relates to methods for providing feedback at<br>
the touch pad. For example, changing intensity or color based on motion<br>
characteristics and/or pressure, providing an illumination point that follows a finger<br>
as it is moved about the touch sensitive surface, showing different states with varying<br>
levels of brightness or color, etc.<br>
[0044] Embodiments of the invention are discussed below with reference to Figs. 1-<br>
25. However, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the detailed<br>
description given herein with respect to these figures is for explanatory purposes as<br>
the invention extends beyond these limited embodiments.<br>
[0045] Fig. 1 is a simplified block diagram of an input device 10, in accordance with<br>
one embodiment of the present invention. The input device 10 may be a standalone<br>
peripheral device that connects to a host device through wired or wireless connections<br>
or it may be integrated into a host device (e.g., hard wired). In either case, the input<br>
device 10 is configured to provide inputs to the host device. Examples of host devices<br>
include any consumer related electronic device such as computers, PDAs, media<br>
players, telephones, etc.<br>
[0046] In order to generate inputs as for example initiating commands, making<br>
selections or tracking, the input device 10 includes an object sensing mechanism 12<br>
configured to detect one or more objects in close proximity to and/or in contact with<br>
an input surface 13. The object sensing mechanism 12 may be based on proximity<br>
sensing and/or touch sensing.<br>
[0047] In the case of proximity sensing, the input surface 13 may be the surface<br>
directly underneath a proximity sensing field. The object sensing mechanism 12<br>
generates input signals when, an object such as a finger (or stylus) is moved above the<br>
input surface and within the sensing field (e.g., x and y plane), from an object<br>
holding a particular position above the surface and within the sensing field and/or by<br>
an object moving through or in and out of the sensing field (e.g., z direction).<br>
Proximity detection may be based on technologies including but not limited to<br><br>
capacitiive, electric field, inductive, hall effect, reed, eddy current, magneto resistive,<br>
optical shadow, optical visual light, optical IR, optical color recognition, ultrasonic,<br>
acoustic emission, radar, heat, sonar, conductive or resistive and the like.<br>
[0048] In the case of touch sensing, the input surface 13 may be a touch surface that<br>
 is sensitive to direct physical touch. The object sensing mechanism 12 generates<br>
input signals when an object in contact with the input surface 13 is moved across the<br>
input surface (e.g., x and y plane), from an object holding a particular position on the<br>
input surface and/or by an object tapping on the input surface. Touch sensing may be<br>
based on technologies including but not limited to resistive, capacitive, infrared and<br>
surface acoustic wave. Examples of touch sensing devices that utilize these<br>
technologies include touch pads, touch screens, and the like.<br>
[0049] To elaborate, the sensing region, i.e., input surface or the sensing field above<br>
the input surface, is typically divided into several independent and spatially distinct<br>
sensing points, nodes or regions. The sensing points, which are typically hidden from<br>
view, are dispersed about the sensing region with each sensing point representing a<br>
different position in the sensing region. The sensing points may be positioned in a<br>
grid or a pixel array where each pixilated sensing point is capable of generating a<br>
signal. In the simplest case, a signal is produced each time an object is positioned<br>
over a sensing point. When an object is placed over multiple sensing points or when<br>
the object is moved between or over multiple sensing points, multiple signals can be<br>
generated. The sensing points generally map the sensing region into a coordinate<br>
system such as a Cartesian coordinate system, a Polar coordinate system or some<br>
other coordinate system. Furthermore, the touch sensing means may be based on<br>
single point sensing or multipoint sensing. Single point sensing is capable of only<br>
distinguishing a single object at any given time, while multipoint sensing is capable<br>
of distinguishing multiple objects at the same time.<br>
[0050] The input device 10 also includes a visual feedback system 14 configured to<br>
output visual effects at the input surface 13 in association with the object sensing<br>
system 12. The visual feedback system 14 is dedicated to enhancing the operation of<br>
the input device 10 by providing visual feedback to the user when making touch or<br>
proximity inputs via the object sensing system 12. For example, the visual effects<br>
may be used to indicate the location of the input surface 13 thereby making inputting<br>
easier for the user (e.g., backlighting).<br><br>
[0051] Alternatively or additionally, the visual effects may be used during and after<br>
the input event to dynamically indicate characteristics associated with the input<br>
events. The characteristics may for example include when and where and the<br>
number of inputs being made relative to the input surface 13. This type of feedback<br>
also improves inputting by providing-visual cues to the user about the input device 10<br>
as the input device 10 is used.<br>
[0052] Alternatively or additionally, the visual effects may be used before an input<br>
event to invoke the user to perform a particular input event at the input surface 13.<br>
This type of feedback also improves inputting by helping the user make appropriate<br>
inputs or helping them learn input gestures (e.g., timing, location and movements).<br>
[0053] In most cases, the visual effects (outputs) are linked or tied to and associated<br>
with the input events being performed. Although capable of, they typically do not<br>
provide external outputs associated with events occurring outside the input device 10.<br>
That is, the visual effects typically do not operate separately as an output for any<br>
device other than the input device 10 (e.g., the visual feedback system should not be<br>
considered a separate display).<br>
[0054] The visual feedback system 14 includes one or more visual changing elements<br>
15. The visual changing elements 15 may be separate of integral with the sensing<br>
elements of the object sensing system 12. In some cases, the one or more of the<br>
visual changing elements 15 may be mapped, associated with or tied to one or more<br>
of the sensing nodes of the object sensing system. The number of visual changing<br>
elements tied to a particular sensing node may be less than, equal to, or more than the<br>
number of sensing nodes.<br>
[0055] The resolution of the visual changing elements 15 can be widely varied. In<br>
one embodiment, the resolution of the visual changing elements 15 is greater than the<br>
sensing nodes (e.g., the number of visual changing elements is greater than the<br>
number of sensing nodes). la another embodiment, the resolution of the visual<br>
changing elements 15 is substantially equal to the resolution of the sensing nodes<br>
(e.g., the number of visual changing elements is substantially equal to the number of<br>
sensing nodes), hi yet "another embodiment, the resolution of the visual changing<br>
elements 15 is less than the resolution of the sensing nodes (e.g., the number of visual<br>
changing elements is less than the number of sensing nodes). The resolution<br>
generally depends on the needs of the particular input device. In some cases, high<br>
resolution is need to create dynamic visual effects such a graphical effects. In other<br><br>
cases, only low resolution is required, as for example to visually change a region as<br>
large as a finger.<br>
[0056] The visual feedback system 14 may be widely varied. In one embodiment, the<br>
visual feedback system 14 is a light based system that illuminates the input surface<br>
13. In this embodiment, the visual changing elements 15 are embodied as light<br>
emitting devices. The light emitting devices may include one or more light sources,<br>
and a light distribution system for distributing the light at the input surface 13. In<br>
some cases, the light from the light sources may be diffused so that the input surface<br>
13 emits a characteristic glow (not a precise point of light, but rather a blurred<br>
glowing effect or phosphorous glow). That is, the input surface can generate glowing<br>
special effects that may for example provide backlighting to the input surface 13<br>
and/or provide an outline, trace or shadow of the sensed object on the input surface<br>
13. The glowing special effects may even indicate a state of the input device as for<br>
example when the input device is in a tracking state or gesture state.<br>
[0057] Alternatively, the visual feedback system may be a graphically based system<br>
that generates graphics at the input surface. LCDs, OLEDs and electronic inks are<br>
examples of graphically based systems. These devices however can be cost<br>
prohibitive and more complex to implement when compared to light based systems.<br>
[0058] The input device 10 also includes a controller 16 that is operatively coupled to •<br>
the object sensing device 12 and visual feedback system 14. The controller 16<br>
monitors signals generated at the input surface 13 and sends corresponding control<br>
signals associated therewith to the host device, which interprets the signals in<br>
accordance with its programming, (e.g., input events). The controller 16 also<br>
generates visual effect commands for controlling the visual effects outputted by the<br>
visual feedback system 14. Single or multiple commands can be generated to<br>
change one, some or all of the visual changing elements at the same time. Further,<br>
the commands may be based on the signals generated via the object sensing device<br>
12.<br>
[0059] In one embodiment, the controller 16 may instruct the visual changing<br>
elements to change in a non-trivial manner in the region of the detected object in<br>
order to indicate a location of the object relative to the input surface 13. ha another<br>
embodiment, the commands may be based on instructions from the host device. For<br>
example, the host device may instruct the input device 10 to backlight the input<br>
surface 13 or alternatively to alter the input surface in such a way as to prompt the<br><br>
user to perform a particular event relative to the input surface (e.g., the host device<br>
may use the input surface to teach the user how to perform a particular gesture).<br>
[0060] Fig. 2 is a method 50 of operating an input device, in accordance with one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The input device may for example be the input<br>
device shown and described in Fig. 1. The method begins at block 52 where one or<br>
more objects are detected at a sensing region. This may for example be accomplished<br>
with the object sensing device described above. Following block 52, the method<br>
proceeds to blocks 54 and 56. In block 54, visual effects are displayed at the sensing<br>
region based on the detected objects. This may for example be accomplished with the<br>
visual feedback system described above.<br>
[0061] In one embodiment, the visual effects are performed in the region of the<br>
detected object. For example, in the case of a light based system, the area under<br>
and/or around the detected object may be illuminated. As should be appreciated, the<br>
visual effects can be made to follow the object as it is moved around the sensing<br>
region. In fact in some cases, the visual effects may include a leading edge, a body,<br>
and/or a trailing edge. The leading edge indicates where the object is directed, the<br>
body indicates the current location of the object, and the trailing edge indicates where<br>
the object has been.<br>
[0062] In another embodiment, the visual effects are performed to indicate the state<br>
of the object sensing event. For example, if one object is detected, a first visual effect<br>
may be performed, and if multiple objects are detected, a second visual effect may be<br>
performed. This may be beneficial in cases where single objects are used for tracking<br>
and multiple objects are used for gesturing.<br>
[0063] In block 56, control signals are generated based on the detected objects. This<br>
may for example be accomplished with the controller described above. The signals<br>
are reported to a host device as an input event, and the host device interprets the<br>
signals in accordance with its programming.<br>
[0064] Fig. 3 is a method 70 of operating an input device, in accordance with one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The input device may for example be the input<br>
device shown and described in Fig. 1. The method begins at block 72 where visual<br>
effects are displayed at the sensing region. This may for example be accomplished<br>
with the visual feedback system described above.<br>
[0065] In one embodiment, the visual effects are based on a control signal from the<br>
host device. For example, the host device may instruct the visual feedback system to<br><br>
output visual effects to encourage a user to place an object at a particular location at<br>
the input surface or to perform a gesture during a particular operation in the host<br>
device (e.g., training sequence).<br>
[0066] Following block 72, the method proceeds to blocks 74 and 76. In block 74,<br>
the sensing region is monitored. This may for example be accomplished with the<br>
object sensing device described above. In block 76, control signals are generated<br>
when objects are detected in the sensing region. This may for example be<br>
accomplished with the controller described above. The signals may be used by the<br>
host device as an input event.<br>
[0067] Fig. 4 is a simplified diagram of touch pad 100, in accordance with one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the touch pad 100 includes<br>
an optically transmissive touch sensing device 102 disposed over a light panel 104.<br>
Both the touch sensing device 102 and the light panel 104 communicate with a<br>
controller 106 that monitors touch inputs on the touch sensitive surface 108 of the<br>
touch sensing device 102 and that directs the light panel 104 to emit light in the<br>
direction of the touch sensing device in a controlled manner.<br>
[0068] The touch sensing device may be widely varied. The touch sensing device<br>
may for example be selected from any of those used for touch screens.<br>
[0069] The light panel may also be widely varied. In one embodiment, the light<br>
panel is a pixilated light device that includes a plurality of light sources mat are<br>
distributed over an extended area such as the touch sensitive surface of the touch<br>
sensing device. The light panel may include a plurality of light emitting diodes<br>
(LEDs) that are laid out in a matrix such as rows and columns. Any number of LEDs<br>
may be used. The number generally depends on the desired resolution of the light<br>
panel. In the simplest case, LEDs are placed next to or adjacent one another in rows<br>
and columns on a PCB that is sized similarly to the touch sensing device (e.g., covers<br>
the same area).<br>
[0070] Fig. 5 is a simplified diagram of a touch pad 120, in accordance with one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the touch pad 120 includes<br>
an opaque or alternatively an optically transmissive touch sensing device 122<br>
disposed below a light panel 124. Both the touch sensing device 122 and the light<br>
panel 124 communicate with a controller 126 that monitors touch inputs on the touch<br>
sensitive surface 128 of the touch sensing device 122 and that directs the light panel<br>
124 to emit light in a controlled manner.<br><br>
[0071] The touch sensing device may be widely varied. The touch sensing device<br>
may for example be selected from any of those used for touch pads or touch screens.<br>
[0072] The light panel may also be widely varied. Unlike the light panel discussed in<br>
Fig. 4, this light panel needs to allow touch sensing to occur therethrough. The light<br>
panel may further need to.be somewhat diffused to hide the electronics displayed -<br>
underneath the light panel. In one embodiment, the light panel includes one or more<br>
light sources and a light distribution mechanism for distributing the light from the<br>
light source over an extended area such as the touch sensitive surface of the touch<br>
sensing device. The light distribution mechanism may include for example light<br>
pipes or light guides that allow the light sources to be placed away from the sensing<br>
field. In one embodiment, the light distribution mechamism is formed from a<br>
dielectric material so that touch sensing can occur therethrough with impediments<br>
(e.g., capacitance). By way of example, transparent or semi-transparent plastic<br>
materials may be used.<br>
[0073] Figs. 6A and 6B are diagrams of an illuminable touch pad 150, in accordance<br>
with one embodiment of the present invention. The touch pad 150 includes a<br>
translucent or semi-translucent touch screen 152 and a pixilated light panel 154<br>
disposed below the touch screen 152. The touch screen 152 is divided into several<br>
independent and spatially distinct sensing points, nodes or regions. The sensing<br>
points, which are hidden from view (transparent), are dispersed about the touch<br>
screen 152 with each sensing point representing a different position on the surface of<br>
the touch, screen (or touch screen plane). The sensing points may be positioned in a<br>
grid or a pixel array where each pixilated sensing point is capable of generating a<br>
signal. In the simplest case, a signal is produced each time an object is positioned<br>
over a sensing point. When an object is placed over multiple sensing points or when<br>
the object is moved between or over multiple sensing point, multiple signals can be<br>
generated.<br>
[0074] In one embodiment, the touch screen 152 includes a plurality of capacitance<br>
sensing nodes. The capacitive sensing nodes may be widely varied. For example, the<br>
capacitive sensing nodes may be based on self-capacitance or mutual capacitance. In<br>
self-capacitance, the "self capacitance of a single electrode is measured as for<br>
example relative to ground. In mutual capacitance, the mutual capacitance between at<br>
least first and second electrodes is measured. In either cases, each of the nodes<br><br>
works independent of the other nodes so as to produce simultaneously occurring<br>
signals representative of different points on the touch screen 152.<br>
[0075] In order to produce a transparent touch screen 152, the capacitance sensing<br>
nodes may be formed with a transparent conductive medium such as indium tin oxide<br>
(ITO).<br>
[0076] In self-capacitance sensing arrangements, the transparent conductive medium<br>
is patterned into spatially separated electrodes and traces. Each of the electrodes<br>
represents a different coordinate and the traces connect the electrodes to a capacitive<br>
sensing circuit. The coordinates may be associated with Cartesian coordinate system<br>
(x and y), Polar coordinate system (r, θ) or some other coordinate system. During<br>
operation, the capacitive sensing circuit monitors changes in capacitance that occur at<br>
each of the electrodes. The positions where changes occur and the magnitude of<br>
those changes are used to help recognize the touch events. A change in capacitance<br>
typically occurs at an electrode when a user places an object such as a finger in close<br>
proximity to the electrode, i.e., the object steals charge thereby affecting the<br>
capacitance.<br>
[0077] In mutual capacitance, the transparent conductive medium is patterned into a<br>
group of spatially separated lines formed on two different layers. Driving lines are<br>
formed on a first layer and sensing lines are formed on a second layer. Although<br>
separated by being on different layers, the sensing lines traverse, intersect or cut<br>
across the driving lines thereby forming a capacitive coupling node. The manner in<br>
which the sensing lines cut across the driving lines generally depends on the<br>
coordinate system used. For example, in a Cartesian coordinate system, the sensing<br>
lines are perpendicular to the driving lines thereby forming nodes with distinct x and<br>
y coordinates. Alternatively, in a polar coordinate system, the sensing lines may be<br>
concentric circles and the driving lines may be radially extending lines (or vice<br>
versa). The driving lines are connected to a voltage source and the sensing lines are<br>
connected to capacitive sensing circuit. During operation, a current is driven through<br>
one driving line at a time, and because of capacitive coupling, the current is carried<br>
through to the sensing lines at each of the nodes (e.g., intersection points).<br>
Furthermore, the sensing circuit monitors changes in capacitance that occurs at each<br>
of the nodes. The positions where changes occur and the magnitude of those changes<br>
are used to help recognize the multiple touch events. A change in capacitance<br>
typically occurs at a capacitive coupling node when a user places an object such as a<br><br>
finger in close proximity to the capacitive coupling node, i.e., the object steals charge<br>
thereby affecting the capacitance.<br>
[0078] Referring now to the light panel 154, the light panel 154 includes a light<br>
emitting surface that is typically divided into several independent and spatially<br>
distinct illumination points, nodes or regions 156. The illumination points 156 are<br>
dispersed about the light emitting surface with each illumination point 156<br>
representing a different position in the light emitting surface. The illumination points<br>
156 may be positioned in a grid or a pixel array where each pixilated illumination<br>
point is capable of emitting light. The illumination points 156 generally map the<br>
illumination region into a coordinate system such as a Cartesian coordinate system, a<br>
Polar coordinate system or some other coordinate system. In some cases, the<br>
illuminaitions points may be laid out in a pattern similar to the sensing points of the<br>
touch panel 152 (e.g., same coordinate system, same number of points). In other<br>
cases, the illumination points 156 may be laid out in a pattern that is different than the<br>
sensing points of the touch panel 152 (e.g., different coordinate system, different<br>
number of points).<br>
[0079] The light panel 154 may be widely varied. In the illustrated embodiment, the<br>
illumination points 156 are embodied as individual light emitting diodes that are<br>
placed in a grid like manner thereby forming a pixilated illumination area, i.e., each<br>
of the light emitting diodes forms an illumination node. The grid may be oriented<br>
rows and columns (x and y) or angular/radial segments (as shown). Furthermore, the<br>
LEDs are attached to the printed circuit board 160 and operatively coupled to the<br>
controller 158 located on the backside of the printed circuit board 160.<br>
[0080] The touch screen 152 is also operatively coupled to the controller 158 as for<br>
example using a flex circuit that attached to the printed circuit board 160. During<br>
operation, the controller 158 monitors the changes in capacitance and generates<br>
control signals based on these changes. The controller 158 also separately adjusts the<br>
intensity of each of the LEDs to illuminate portions or all of the touch screen 152 in a<br>
controlled manner. That is, the light panel 154 can produce any number of various<br>
light effects by selectively controlling the intensities of the LED's via the controller<br>
158. Because the touch screen 154 is translucent, the light can be seen through the<br>
touch screen 154.<br>
[0081] In some cases, the touch pad 150 may further include a light diffuser 162.<br>
The light diffuser 162 is configured to diffuse the light being emitted by the light<br><br>
panel 154. This may be done to normalize the light intensity of the LEDs, to produce<br>
a characteristic glow at the input surface, and/or to hide the physical parts of the touch<br>
pad located underneath the light diffuser.<br>
[0082] Although the light diffuser 162 can include color components, in most cases,<br>
the light diffuser appears as a white or semi transparent white material. When<br>
embodied with white elements, the light diffuser 162 takes on the color of light<br>
emitted by the LEDs. Generally speaking, the light diffuser 162 is positioned<br>
somewhere between the LEDs and the input surface. More particularly, the light<br>
diffuser 162 can be placed above, within or underneath the touch screen. For<br>
example, a light diffuser 162 can be placed on the upper surface, lower surface, or in<br>
the layers of the touch screen. Alternatively or additionally, the light diffuser 162<br>
may be integrated with or attached to the light panel or even be a separate component<br>
disposed between the light panel 154 and touch screen 152 (as shown).<br>
[0083] The light diffuser 162 may be embodied in many different forms including for<br>
example surface treatments on one or more layers of the touch screen, additives in<br>
one or more layers of the touch screen, an additional layer in the touch screen, rigid<br>
plastic inserts disposed above or below the touch screen, flexible labels disposed<br>
above or below the touch screen, and the like. The light diffuser 162 may even be the<br>
ITO coating used to form the sensing components of the touch screen (e.g., the<br>
greater the density of the ITO coating, the greater the amount of light that is diffused).<br>
[0084] In the illustrated embodiment, the light diffuser 162 is a plastic insert that<br>
includes light scattering additives. Furthermore, the light diffuser 162 is disposed<br>
between the light panel 154 and the touch screen 152.<br>
[0085] It should be pointed out that LED's offer many advantages over other light<br>
sources. For example, LED's are relatively small devices that are energy efficient<br>
and long lasting. LED's also run relatively cool and are low in cost. Furthermore,<br>
LED's come in various colors such as white, blue, green, red and the like. The<br>
pixilated LEDs may be configured to emit that same color of light or a different color<br>
of light.<br>
[0086] Furthermore, although shown as single LEDs, it should be noted that the<br>
LEDs may be embodied as an integrated array of LEDs that are grouped together as<br>
for example an array of red, blue, green and/or white LEDs that cooperate to produce<br>
a resultant color (via color mixing). The resultant color may be a wide range of<br>
colors, as for example, a majority of the colors from the color spectrum. During<br><br>
operation, the controller can produced almost any color by adjusting the intensity of<br>
each of the colored LED's. By way of example, in order to produce the highest shade<br>
of red, the intensities of the green and blue are reduced to zero intensity and the<br>
intensity of the red is increased to its peak intensity. The highest shades of green and<br>
blue can be implemented in a similar manner. In addition, in order to produce a shade<br>
of red and green, the intensities of the green and red are increased to levels above<br>
zero intensity while the intensity of blue is reduced to zero intensity. Shades of green<br>
and blue and blue and red can be implemented in a similar manner. Furthermore, in<br>
order to produce shades of white, the intensities of the red, green and blue are<br>
increased to the same levels above zero intensity, or alternatively the red, green and<br>
blue LED's are turned off and a white LED is turned on.<br>
[0087] Although the integrated LED array is described as using the three primary<br>
colors, it should be noted that this is not a limitation and that other combinations may<br>
be used. For example, the integrated LED array may be configured to include only<br>
two of the primary colors or it may only include LED's with a single color.<br>
[0088] When the LEDs are capable of generating any color, unique input surfaces can<br>
be produced. By way of example, the touch pad can produce an input surface with<br>
rainbow stripes, different colored spots, different colored quadrants or sections and<br>
the like. The touch pad can also produce an input surface that has a dynamically<br>
changing pattern. This is typically accomplished by activating distinct LED's at<br>
different times or by adjusting the intensities of distinct LED's at different times.<br>
[0089] Figs 7A and 7B are diagrams of a touch pad 200, in accordance with another<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The touch pad 200 includes various layers<br>
including a light panel 202, an electrode layer 204 and a printed circuit board 206<br>
(PCB). The electrode layer 204 is positioned on the PCB 206 and the light panel 202<br>
is placed above the electrode layer 204.<br>
[0090] The electrode layer 204 includes a plurality of spatially separated electrodes<br>
205 configured to detect changes in capacitance at an upper surface 208 of the light<br>
panel 202. Each of the electrodes 205 is operatively coupled to a controller 210<br>
located on the backside of the printed circuit board 206. During operation, the<br>
controller 210 monitors the changes in capacitance and generates control signals<br>
based on these changes.<br>
[0091] The light panel 202 includes a light distribution panel 212 disposed over the<br>
electrode layer 204 and one or more side mounted light emitting diodes 214 disposed<br><br>
around the periphery of the light distribution panel 212. The side mounted light<br>
emitting diodes 214 are configured to direct light into a different portion of the light<br>
distribution panel 212. Alternatively, a light pipe may be used to direct light from an<br>
LED located away from the light distribution panel 212. The light distribution panel<br>
212 is configured to redirect the light made incident thereon via the light emitting<br>
diodes 214 to an upper surface of the light distribution panel 212 thereby illuminating<br>
the touch pad surface 201. The light distribution panel 212 is also configured to serve<br>
as a dielectric layer that covers the electrode layer 204 in order to help form the<br>
capacitance sensing circuit of the touch pad 200.<br>
[0092] As shown, the LEDs 214 are attached to the printed circuit board 206 and<br>
operatively coupled to the controller 210 located on the backside of the printed circuit<br>
board 206. During operation, the controller 210 selectively adjusts the intensity of<br>
each of the LEDs 214 to illuminate portions of or all of the light distribution panel<br>
212 in a controlled manner.<br>
[0093] Although shown as single LEDs, the LEDs may be embodied as an array of<br>
LEDs as for example an array of red, blue and green LEDs. Arrayed LEDs such as<br>
this may be capable of generating most colors in the color spectrum.<br>
[0094] The light distribution panel 212 can be widely varied. In one embodiment, the<br>
light distribution panel 212 is a separate component disposed within the housing 211<br>
of the touch pad 200. For example, the light distribution panel 212 is inserted within<br>
an opening in the housing 211 (as shown). In this arrangement, it may be preferable<br>
to place the upper surface of the light distribution panel 212 flush with or recessed<br>
below the outer surface of the housing 211. Furthermore, in order to provide a tight<br>
fit that limits dust and particles from entering the touch pad 200, the light distribution<br>
panel 212 may include edges that extend over the outer surface of the housing 211.<br>
[0095] In another embodiment, the light distribution panel 212 is an integral part of<br>
the housing 211. For example, the housing 211 is formed from a transparent or semi-<br>
transparent material. This particular embodiment provides a continuous surface<br>
without gaps or breaks, which can be aesthetically pleasing to the user.<br>
[0096] In either embodiment, the light distribution panel 212 typically includes a<br>
portion 213 that extends below the inner surface of the housing 211. This portion 213<br>
provides a light receiving area at the sides of the light distribution panel 212 for<br>
receiving light emitted by the side mounted LED's 214.<br><br>
[0097] The light distribution panel 212, which can be formed from a single or<br>
multiple layers, is typically formed from translucent or semi-translucent dielectric<br>
materials including for example plastic materials such as polycarbonate, acrylic or<br>
ABS plastic. It should be appreciated, however, that these materials are not a<br>
limitation and thatany optically transmittable dielectric material may be used.<br>
[0098] In most cases, the light distribution panel 212 or some other component of the<br>
touch pad 200 includes light diffusing elements to diffuse the light made incident<br>
thereon in order to normalize the light intensity of the LEDs, to produce a<br>
characteristic glow at the input surface, and/or to hide the physical parts of the touch<br>
pad located underneath the input surface. The light diffusing elements may be<br>
provided on an inner surface, outer surface or they may be embedded inside the light <br>
distribution panel 212. Additionally or alternatively, the light diffusing elements can<br>
also be applied to a separate optical component disposed above the light distribution<br>
panel 212.<br>
[0099] In one embodiment, the light diffusing element: is an additive disposed inside<br>
the light distribution panel 212. For example, the light distribution panel 212 may<br>
include a plurality of light scattering particles dispersed between the top and bottom<br>
surfaces of the light distribution panel. When the light is made incident on the inner<br>
surface, it is transmitted through the light distribution panel 212 until is intersects a<br>
light scattering particle disposed inside the panel. After intersecting the light<br>
scattering particle, the light is scattered outwards in a plurality of directions, i.e., the<br>
light is reflected off the surface and/or refracted through the light scattering particle<br>
thereby creating the characteristic glow. By way of example, the light scattering<br>
particles may be formed from small glass particles or white pigments. Furthermore,<br>
by changing the amount of light scattering particles disposed in the panel, the<br>
characteristics of the glow can be altered, i.e., the greater the particles the greater the<br>
light scattering.<br>
[00100]	In another embodiment, the light diffusing element is a layer, coating<br>
and/or texture that is applied to the inner, side or outer surfaces of the panel 212. For<br>
example, the panel 212 may include a light scattering coating or a light scattering<br>
texture disposed on the side or outer surface of the panel. By way of example, the<br>
light scattering coating may be a paint, film or spray coating. In addition, the light<br>
scattering texture may be a molded surface of the wall or a sandblasted surface of the<br>
panel. When light is made incident on the inner or outer surface, it intersects the light<br><br>
scattering coating or texture applied on the surface. After intersecting the light<br>
scattering coating or the light scattering texture, the light is scattered outwards in a<br>
plurality of directions, i.e., the light is reflected off the surface and/or refracted<br>
through the light scattering particle thereby creating a characteristic glow.<br>
[00101]	In the illustrated embodiment, the light diffusing element is embodied<br>
as a light diffusing label 216. The light diffusing label 216 is at least adhered to the<br>
top surface of the light distribution panel 212. In some cases, the label 216 may even<br>
extend over and be adhered to a top edge of the housing wall 211. In cases such as<br>
this, the light diffusing label 216 may even be placed in a pocket formed by recesses<br>
217 at the top edge of the housing wall 211 in order to make the top surface of the<br>
light diffusing label 216 flush with the external surface of the housing wall 211. The<br>
label 216 can have a graphic printed thereon, can have multiple colors and can have<br>
varying thickness to assist in controlling the intensity and color of the illumination.<br>
The label 216 may be formed from transparent or semitransparent dielectric materials<br>
such as Mylar or Polycarbonate or any other dielectric material that is thin, optically<br>
transmittable and includes some sort of light diffusing means.<br>
[00102]	Further, the light distribution panel 212 may be configured as a single<br>
node, or it may be broken up into plurality of distinct nodes 218, each of which<br>
includes its own dedicated light emitting diode for individual illumination thereof.<br>
During operation, when light is released by a light emitting diode 214, the light is<br>
made incident on the side of the light distribution panel 212 at the node 218. The<br>
node 218 redirects and transmits the light from its side to an upper surface of the node<br>
218. In order to prevent light bleeding between adjacent nodes 218, each node 218<br>
may be optically separated by a reflecting or masking region disposed therebetween.<br>
[00103]	Each of the nodes 218 may be formed from a solid piece of material or<br>
it may be formed from a combination of elements. In one embodiment, each of the<br>
nodes 218 is formed from a translucent or semi-translucent plastic insert that when<br>
combined with the other inserts forms the light distribution panel 212. In another<br>
embodiment, each of the nodes 218 is formed from a bundle of fiber optic strands.<br>
[00104]	The configuration of the nodes 218 including layout, shape and size<br>
may be widely varied. With regards to layout, the nodes 218 may be based on a Polar<br>
or Cartesian coordinate system (or some other coordinate system). With regards to<br>
shape, any shape including for example standard shapes such as circles, squares,<br>
rectangles, triangles, may be used. With regards to size, the nodes 218 may be larger<br><br>
than a finger or stylus, about the same size as a finger or stylus, or smaller than a<br>
finger or stylus. In one embodiment, the nodes 218 are set up similarly to the<br>
electrodes 205 of the electrode layer 204, i.e., the nodes 218 have generally the same<br>
layout, number, size and shape as the electrodes 205. In another embodiment, the<br>
nodes are set up differently. For example, the nodes 218 may have a different layout,<br>
different number, different shape and/or different size when compared to the<br>
electrodes 205.<br>
[00105]	In the illustrated embodiment, the touch pad 200 is circular and the<br>
nodes 218 are embodied as distinct angular segments (e.g., pie shaped). Any number<br>
of angular segments may be used. The number generally depends on the desired<br>
resolution of the illuminating surface. In this particular embodiment, the resolution of<br>
the light panel 202 is low and therefore each of the angular segments cover a plurality<br>
of sensing electrodes 205.<br>
[00106]	In one embodiment, all the LEDs 214 are powered at the same time to<br>
produce a fully illuminated touch pad 200. This may be analogous to backlighting.<br>
In another embodiment, the LEDs 214 are powered in accordance with the<br>
capacitance changes measured by each of the electrodes 205. For example, the<br>
segments above the detected area may be illuminated while the segments above the<br>
undetected areas may be turned off. This provides indication to the user as to their •<br>
exact location of the touch surface. In yet another embodiment, selected segments<br>
may be illuminated to encourage a user to place their finger in a particular area of the<br>
touch pad.<br>
[00107]	Although only a single light panel 202 is shown, it should be<br>
appreciated that this is not a limitation and that additional light panels may be used.<br>
For example, one or more light panels may be further positioned underneath the first<br>
light panel described above. In one embodiment, each light panel in a group of light<br>
panels is configured to distribute a different color. For example, three light panels<br>
including a red, green and blue light panel may be used. Using this arrangement,<br>
different colored segments may be produced. By controlling their intensity, almost<br>
any color can be produced (mixed) at the touch surface. In another embodiment, each<br>
light panel in the group of light panels may have a different orientation. For example,<br>
the angularly segmented nodes of the light distribution panel may be rotated relative<br>
to the other light panels so that they are placed at different positions about an axis<br><br>
(e.g., partially overlapping and angularly offset). Using this arrangement, leading and<br>
trailing illumination can be produced.<br>
[00108]	Figs 8A and 8B are diagrams of an illuminated touch pad 250, in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The touch pad 250 is<br>
 similar to the touch pad 200 shown in Figs 7A and 7B in that it includes a light panel<br>
252, electrode layer 254 and PCB 256. It differs from the touch pad of Figs. 7A and<br>
7B in that the light panel 252 additionally includes inner side mounted LEDs 258 to<br>
go along with the outer side mounted LEDs 260. It also differs from the touch pad of<br>
Figs. 7A and 7B in that the light distribution panel 262 of the light panel 252 breaks<br>
up each of the angularly segmented nodes of Fig. 7 into a pair of radially positioned<br>
nodes including inner nodes 264 and outer nodes 266 that cooperate with the<br>
respective LEDs 258 and 260. As a result, each of the nodes 264 and 266 represent<br>
both an angular and radial position in the plane of the touch pad 250. This works<br>
particularly well in touch pads with a circular shape. In addition, unlike the touch pad<br>
of Figs. 7 A and 7B, the touch pad 250 also includes a mechanical button 268 at the<br>
center of the touch pad 250. The mechanical button 268 may be illuminated with one<br>
or more center LEDs 270.<br>
[00109]	In this embodiment, both the light distribution panel 262 and the<br>
electrode layer 254 have an annular shape that creates a void at the center of the touch<br>
pad 250. The void provides a space for placement of the extra light emitting diodes<br>
258 and 270 as well as the mechanical button 268. As shown, the inner LEDs 258 are<br>
disposed along the inner periphery of the light distribution panel 262 next to distinct<br>
inner nodes 264 of the light distribution pane 262. Furthermore, the outer LEDs 260<br>
are disposed along the outer periphery of the light distribution panel 262 next to<br>
distinct outer nodes 266 of the light distribution panel 262.<br>
[00110]	Furthermore, the center LED 270 is disposed near the center of the<br>
touch pad 250 underneath a translucent button cap 272 of the mechanical button 270.<br>
The button cap 272 is movable trapped between a diffusing label layer 274 and a<br>
spring loaded switch 276 that is also located near the center of the touch pad 250.<br>
When the button cap is pressed, it moves against the actuator of the spring loaded<br>
switch thereby generating a button event.<br>
[00111]	In the illustrated embodiment, the electrode layer 254, LEDs 258, 260<br>
and 270 and mechanical switch 276 are all attached to the printed circuit board 256,<br>
and operatively coupled to a controller 280 located on the backside of the PCB 256.<br><br>
During operation, the controller 280 monitors the signals generated at the electrode<br>
layer 254 and switch 276, and provides commands for controlling the LEDs 258, 260<br>
and 270.<br>
[00112]	Figs 9 A and 9B are diagrams of an illuminated touch pad 300, in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The touch pad-300 is<br>
similar to the touch pad shown in Figs 8A and 8B in that it includes a light panel 302,<br>
electrode layer 304 and PCB 306. It differs from the touch pad of Figs 8A and 8B in<br>
that the light panel 302 includes a second set of inner LEDs 310 to go along with a<br>
first set of inner LEDs 308 and a second set of outer LEDs 314 to go along with a<br>
first set of outer LEDs 312. The first sets are located above the second sets, and may<br>
be masked from one another to prevent bleed through.<br>
[00113]	It also differs from the touch pad of Figs. 8A and 8B in that the light<br>
distribution panel 316 of the light panel 302 further breaks up each of the angularly<br>
segmented nodes into four radially positioned nodes including inner nodes 318,<br>
inner/middle nodes 320, outer/middle nodes 322, and outer nodes 324 that optically<br>
cooperate with their respective LEDs. Particularly, the first set of inner LEDs 308 are<br>
positioned to illuminate the inner nodes 318, the second set of inner LEDs 310 are<br>
positioned to illuminate the inner/middle nodes 320, the first set of outer LEDs 312<br>
are positioned to illuminate the outer nodes 324, and the second set of outer LEDs<br>
314 are positioned to illuminate the outer/middle nodes 322.<br>
[00114]	In order to transmit light from the second set of inner LEDs 310 to the<br>
inner/middle nodes 320, the inner/middle nodes 320 may include a light transmitting<br>
portion 326 that extends underneath the inner nodes 318. In most cases, the light<br>
transmitting potions 326 are optically separated from the inner nodes 318 so that the<br>
light does not bleed into the inner nodes 318 when the light is passing through the<br>
light transmitting portions 326.<br>
[00115]	In order to transmit light from the second set of outer LEDs 314 to the<br>
outer/middle nodes 322, the outer/middle nodes 322 ma.y include a light transmitting<br>
portion 328 that extends underneath the outer nodes 324. In most cases, the light<br>
transmitting potions 328 are optically separated from the outer nodes 324 so that the<br>
light does not bleed into the outer nodes 324 when the light is passing through the<br>
light transmitting portions 328. Alternatively, a light pipe may be used.<br>
[00116]	The light distribution panel 316 may be embodied in a variety of ways.<br>
In one embodiment, the light distribution panel 316 includes an outer translucent ring<br><br>
disposed over and around a stepped outer/middle translucent ring, and an inner<br>
translucent ring disposed over and around a stepped inner/middle translucent ring that<br>
is adjacent the outer/middle ring. A masking layer may be placed between the<br>
various rings to prevent bleed through.<br>
 [00117] Although-the touch has been described with only four radial segments,<br>
it should be noted that any number of radial segments may be used as well as any<br>
number of angular segments to obtain the desired resolution.<br>
[00118]	Fig 10 is a diagram of an illuminated touch pad 350, in accordance<br>
with one embodiment of the present invention. The touch pad 350 includes various<br>
layers including a diffuser layer 352, an opaque electrode layer 354, a PCB 356 and a<br>
light panel 358. The light panel 358 may be embodied as a light panel including<br>
pixilated light sources such as the one described in Fig. 6 or a light panel including a<br>
light distribution panel and side mounted light sources such as the one described in<br>
Fig. 7.<br>
[00119]	To elaborate, the light diffuser layer 352 is disposed over the<br>
electrode layer 354, the opaque electrode layer 354 is disposed on the PCB 356, and<br>
the PCB 356 is disposed over the light panel 358. In order to illuminate the light<br>
diffuser layer 352, the electrode layer 354 includes one or more openings 360 through<br>
which light may pass when emitted from the light panel 358. The openings 360 may<br>
be the gaps that would normally be formed between the spatially separated electrodes<br>
or they may be predetermined gaps around which the spatially separated electrodes<br>
are positioned when printed on the PCB 356. Furthermore, in order to allow light to<br>
pass through the PCB 356, the PCB 356 either is formed from a translucent material<br>
or it also includes one or more openings 362 that correspond with the openings 360 of<br>
the electrode layer 354. Moreover, the light panel 358 is typically laid out similarly<br>
to the openings 360/362 so that each of the openings 360/362 includes an individual<br>
light source 364 of the light panel 358. During operation, the light emitted from each<br>
of the light sources 364 travels through the PCB 356 and through the electrode layer<br>
354 where it illuminates either the diffuser layer 352 or a button cap 366.<br>
[00120]	Fig. 11 is a diagram of a light panel 400 that can be used in an<br>
illuminated touch pad, in accordance with another embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The light panel may, for example, correspond to any of those described<br>
above. The light panel 400 includes a diffuser panel 402, one or more light<br>
multiplexers 404 and a controller. The diffuser panel 402 is configured to diffuse<br><br>
light as described above. The light multiplexer 404, which is operatively coupled to<br>
the controller 406 and in optical communication with the diffuser panel 402, is<br>
configured to illuminate the diffuser panel 402 in a controlled and pixilated manner<br>
via commands from the controller 406.<br>
[100121]	The light multiplexer 404 includes a single light emitting device 408<br>
and a plurality of light pipes 410 with corresponding light switches 412. The light<br>
pipe 410 may for example include one or more optical fibers, and the light emitting<br>
device 408 may be embodied in many different forms including for example one or<br>
more individual LEDs or one or more LED arrays.<br>
[00122]	The first end of each light pipe 410 is optically connected to a different<br>
point, node or region of the diffuser panel 402. The light pipes 410 can therefore<br>
form a pixilated pattern of illumination points, nodes or regions across the light<br>
diffuser panel 402. By way of example, the position of the light pipes 410 may be<br>
based on Cartesian coordinates, Polar coordinates, or some other coordinate system.<br>
The second and opposite end of each of the light pipes 410 is optically connected to a<br>
distinct light switch 412. The light switches 412 are therefore dedicated to a<br>
particular illumination point, node or region of the diffuser panel 402. Further, the<br>
light switches 412 are all in optical communication with the light emitting device 408.<br>
ha some cases, the light emitting device 408 extends across the light switches 412. hi<br>
other cases, the light emitted by the light emitting device 408 is focused onto the<br>
various light switches 412 via a lens or light guide 414.<br>
[00123]	Furthermore, the light switches 412 and light emitting device 408 are<br>
operatively coupled to the controller 406. During operation, the controller 406<br>
selectively controls the light emitted by the light emitting device 408 (e.g., color and<br>
intensity), and at the same time selectively controls the opening and closing of the<br>
light switches 412. As such, the illumination provided at the diffuser panel 402 can<br>
be controlled in a pixilated manner using a single light emitting device 408. Any<br>
number of switches can be opened or closed at any particular point in time to provide<br>
the desired illumination pattern (by opening and closing different light switches,<br>
various patterns can be created). When the light is turned on and a light switch is<br>
opened, light is allowed to pass through the light switch into the associated light pipe,<br>
which carries the light from the light switch to a distinct illumination point node or<br>
region of the diffuser panel. When the light is turned on and a light switch is<br><br>
closed, light is blocked from entering the light pipe and therefore no illumination is<br>
provided at the corresponding point, node or region of the diffuser panel.<br>
[00124]	It should be noted that the multiplexer can include any number of<br>
switches, and the light panel can include any number of multiplexers to arrive at the<br>
desired resolution of the light panel.<br>
[00125]	Fig. 12 is a method 450 of operating an illuminated touch pad, in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The method includes at<br>
least blocks 452 and 454. In block 452, an object is detected over an input surface of<br>
the touch pad. This may for example be accomplished with a capacitance sensing<br>
device. In 454, at least a portion of the input surface proximate the location of the<br>
detected object is illuminated. This may be accomplished with a light panel disposed<br>
above or below the touch pad. As a result, the user will be informed where the object<br>
is located within the sensing plane at all times.<br>
[00126]	In one embodiment, the input surface is broken up into illumination<br>
regions, and whichever region is closest to the detected object is illuminated. By way<br>
of example, and referring to Fig. 13 A, if the user places their finger over a single<br>
angular segment of the distribution panel that particular angular segment is<br>
illuminated. If the user simultaneously places their finger over multiple segments one<br>
of two things may occur. In one implementation, both segments are illuminated. In<br>
another implementation, only one of the segments is illuminated. In the later case, a<br>
decision may be made as to which segment is the intended segment.<br>
[00127]	In another embodiment, the input surface is broken up into<br>
illumination nodes or points (pixilated), and those points contained within and/or<br>
surrounding the detected object area are illuminated. In one implementation, at least<br>
the area adjacent the object is illuminated. By way of example, and referring to Fig.<br>
14A, if the user places their finger over the input surface, illumination points adjacent<br>
and surrounding the location of the finger are illuminated. In some cases, the<br>
illumination points are only those points next to the finger (e.g., halo). In other cases,<br>
the illuminated points extend away from the finger as for example in a star like<br>
configuration.<br>
[00128]	The method may additionally include blocks 456 and 458. In block<br>
456, a second object is detected over the input surface at the same time as the first<br>
object. This may for example be accomplished with a multipoint capacitance sensing<br>
device. In block 458, at least a portion of the input surface proximate the location of<br><br>
the second detected object is illuminated. As a result, the user will be informed where<br>
distinct multiple objects are located within the sensing plane at all times.<br>
[00129] In one embodiment, the input surface is broken up into illumination<br>
regions, and the regions closest to the detected objects are illuminated. By way of<br>
example, and referring to Fig. 13B, when two fingers are placed over the input-<br>
surface, two illumination segments in the location of the fingers are illuminated at the<br>
same time.<br>
[00130]	In another embodiment, the input surface is broken up into<br>
illumination nodes or points (pixilated), and those points contained within and/or<br>
surrounding the detected objects are illuminated. By way of example, and referring<br>
to Fig. 14B, when two finger are placed over the input surface, the area around both<br>
fingers are illuminated at the same time.<br>
[00131]	Fig. 15 is a method 500 of operating an illuminated touch pad, in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The method 500 generally<br>
begins at block 502 where object sensing is performed. This may for example be<br>
accomplished with a capacitive touch sensing device. In block 504, at least a portion<br>
of the input surface is illuminated when an object is detected. In most cases, the<br>
portion of the illuminated surface that is illuminated is a localized area disposed near,<br>
around, and/or underneath the location of the detected object. The illuminated<br>
portion may for example be one or more illumination points, nodes or regions. In<br>
most cases, the portion is sized similarly to the size of the object. In the case of a<br>
finger for example the illumination portion may cover an area similar to the detected<br>
area of the finger.<br>
[00132]	In block 506, a determination is made as to whether or not the object is<br>
moving. If the object is not moving, the method proceeds to block 508 where a<br>
determination is made as to whether or not the object is still detected. If the object is<br>
still detected, the method proceeds back to block 504 where the same portion of the<br>
input surface is illuminated. If the object is no longer detected, the method proceeds<br>
to block 510 where the illumination is stopped. This may occur immediately after<br>
determining that an object is no longer detected, or it may occur after a period of time<br>
(e.g., time out). Furthermore, the illumination may be stopped using an illumination<br>
effect such as fading out. Thereafter, the method proceeds back to block 502.<br>
[00133]	Referring back to block 506, if the object is moving across the input<br>
surface, the method proceeds to block 512 where motion characteristics of the object<br><br>
are determined. The motion characteristics-may for example include acceleration;<br>
direction, and the like. Thereafter, in block 514, the characteristics of the<br>
illumination are adjusted based on one or more motion characteristics. Following<br>
blocks 514, the method proceeds back to block 506.<br>
[00134]	In one embodiment, block, 514. includes moving the illumination area<br>
in accordance with the location of the moving object. That is, the illuminated portion<br>
follows the finger as the finger is moved about the input surface (i.e., the illumination<br>
tracks object movement). As a result, the user always knows where the object is<br>
located relative to the input surface. In some cases, block 514 may further include<br>
providing directional indicators around the illuminated portion in order to indicate<br>
previous and/or future locations of the object based on the motion characteristics of<br>
the moving object (e.g., acceleration, direction, etc.).<br>
[00135]	Figs. 16A-16D illustrate one implementation where the illuminated<br>
portion follows the motion of the finger as it is moved across the surface. In this<br>
illustration, illuminated segments are configured to follow the motion of the finger as<br>
it is moved across the surface. Fig. 16A illustrates the state when no objects are<br>
detected. Fig. 16B illustrates the state when an object is detected, and the segment<br>
underneath the object is illuminated. Fig. 16C illustrates the state where the<br>
illuminated segment follows the moving finger. Fig. 16D illustrates one<br>
implementation where the illuminated segment further includes a leading edge, body<br>
and trailing edge. The leading edge indicates the direction of the motion, the body<br>
indicates the current location of the finger, and the trailing edge indicates where the<br>
finger has been.<br>
[00136]	The leading edge, body and trailing edge may have different<br>
illumination profiles. For example, the leading edge may have a high intensity level,<br>
the body may have a medium intensity level and the trailing edge may have a low<br>
intensity level. Alternatively, the leading edge may have a low intensity level, the<br>
body may have a high intensity level, and the trailing edge may have a low intensity<br>
level. Alternatively or additionally, the colors of these components may differ. For<br>
example, the leading edge may be red, the body may be orange and the trailing edge<br>
may be yellow. Furthermore, the trailing edge may include an illumination tail. For<br>
example, the trailing edge may be segmented into regions that go from higher<br>
intensity to lower intensity levels (e.g., fades outwardly from body).<br><br>
[00137]	Figs. 17A-17D illustrate another implementation where the illuminated<br>
portion follows the motion of the finger as it is moved across the surface. In this<br>
illustration, the area around the finger is illuminated and configured to follow the<br>
motion of the finger as it is moved across the surface. Fig. 17A illustrates the state<br>
when no objects are detected. Fig. 17B illustrates the state when an object is <br>
detected, and the area around the object is illuminated (e.g., halo). Fig. 17C<br>
illustrates the state where the illuminated area follows the moving finger. Fig. 17D<br>
illustrates one implementation where the illuminated area includes a body and a tail<br>
(e.g., comet). The body surrounds the finger with illumination and the tail tapers<br>
away from the body to a point. The tail trails the body as the body moves around the<br>
input surface. The tail therefore indicates the previous location of the object. The tail<br>
typically has a lower intensity level than the body. The intensity of the tail may even<br>
vary from higher to lower intensity levels as for example over its length or from its<br>
core to its edge.<br>
[00138]	Fig. 18 is a method 550 of operating an illuminated touch pad, in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.. The method 500 generally<br>
begins at block 552 where object sensing is performed. In block 554, the state of the<br>
touch pad is determined. The states may for example be selected from a selection<br>
state, tracking state or gesture state. In a selection state, the touch pad is set up for<br>
receiving selection inputs from the user (e.g., acts like a button). In a tracking state,<br>
the touch pad is set up to track a finger as it is moved about the input surface. In a<br>
gesture state, the touch pad is set up to receive various gesture inputs from the user.<br>
[00139]	In block 556, the input surface is illuminated based on the state of the<br>
touch pad. As a result, the user is alerted to the current state of the touch pad, and<br>
therefore the type of inputs that can be made. By way of example, each state may<br>
include a different illumination profile. An illumination profile defines the<br>
illumination characteristics of the illumination to be provided. The illumination<br>
characteristics include for example intensity and/or color and/or illumination effects<br>
(e.g., fading, blinking, rastering, etc). In one example, a first state includes a first<br>
illumination profile (e.g., first color), a second state includes a second illumination<br>
profile (e.g., second color), and the third state includes a third illumination profile<br>
(e.g., third color).<br>
[00140]	Referring to 19 A, one example of determining state will be described.<br>
In blocks 570 and 574, one or more objects are detected. In block 572, if a single<br><br>
object is detected, the touch pad is placed in a tracking slate such lhat object motion is<br>
used to perform tracking operations. In block 576, if multiple objects are detected,<br>
the touch pad is placed in a gesturing state such that object motion is used to perform<br>
gesturing operations. By way of example, and referring to Figs. 20 A and 20B, when<br>
 a single finger is detected, the touch pad is placed in a first state, and when multiple<br>
fingers are detected, the touch pad is placed in a second state.<br>
[00141]	Referring to 19B, one example of illuminating based on states will be<br>
described. In blocks 580 and 582, a determination is made as to whether the touch<br>
pad is in a tracking state or a gesturing state. In block 584, if the touch pad is in a<br>
tracking state, the touch pad is illuminated with a first illumination profile. In block<br>
586, if the touch pad is in a gesturing state, the touch pad is illuminated with a second<br>
illumination profile that is different than the first illumination profile. The<br>
illumination profiles contain illumination information such as color, intensity and<br>
effects (e.g., blinking, fading, etc). By way of example, and referring to Figs. 20A<br>
and 20B., when the touch pad is in a first state, the touch pad is illuminated with a first<br>
color or intensity, and when the touch pad is in a second state, the touch pad is<br>
illuminated with a second color or intensity.<br>
[00142]	In one embodiment, the method of changing illumination based on<br>
states of the touch pad may be further developed. For example, the method may<br>
include capturing a first touch image; determining the touch mode based on the first<br>
touch image; and illuminating the touch surface based on the first touch mode. The<br>
method may also include capturing a second touch image; determining the touch<br>
mode based on the second touch image; determining if the touch mode changed<br>
between the first and second touch images; if the touch mode stayed the same,<br>
comparing the first and second touch images and performing a control function based<br>
on the comparison; and if the touch mode changed, illuminating the touch surface<br>
based on the second touch mode. The method additionally includes capturing a third<br>
touch image; determining the touch mode based on the third touch image;<br>
determining if the touch mode changed between the second and third touch images; if<br>
the touch mode stayed the same, comparing the second and third touch images and<br>
performing a control function based on the comparison; and if the touch mode<br>
changed, illuminating the touch surface based on the third touch mode.<br>
[00143]	Fig. 21 is a method 600 of operating an illuminated touch pad, in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The method generally<br><br>
begins at block 602 where an object is detected. In block 604, a least a portion of the<br>
input surface is illuminated when the object is detected. In block 606, z<br>
characteristics of the object are determined. The z characteristics may include the<br>
pressure being exerted on the input surface by the object, and/or the location of the<br>
object in the z direction relative to the x-y input surface (e.g., how close the object is <br>
to the x-y plane). In block 608, the illumination characteristics are adjusted based on<br>
the z-characteristic. For example, the color and/or intensity of the illumination may<br>
be adjusted based on the z height or pressure.<br>
[00144]	By way of example, and referring to Figs. 22A and 22B, the entire<br>
touch pad may be illuminated when the object is detected, and the intensity of the<br>
illumination may be increased when an object is closer or exerts increased pressure<br>
relative to the touch surface, and the intensity may be decreased when an object is<br>
further away or exerts decreased pressure relative to the touch surface. Alternatively,<br>
only a portion of the touch pad may be illuminated (as for example a segment or the<br>
area directly adjacent the finger) and the intensity of the illumination may be<br>
increased when an object is closer or exerts increased pressure relative to the touch<br>
surface, and the intensity may be decreased when an object is further away or exerts<br>
decreased pressure relative to the touch surface.<br>
[00145]	Fig. 23 is a method 700 of operating an illuminated touch pad, in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The method generally<br>
begins at block 702 where an object sensing is performed. In block 704, at least a<br>
portion of the input surface is illuminated in response to the sensed object. For<br>
example, a segment or the area around a finger may be illuminated. Thereafter in<br>
block 706, a rotational user input is detected over the input surface. For example, in<br>
the case of a circular touch pad, the rotational user input may be the user swirling<br>
their finger around the circular touch pad. In some cases, this may include<br>
determining an acceleration value pertaining to the rotational user input. In block<br>
708, the input surface is illuminated in accordance with the rotational user input. For<br>
example, the region of the touch pad underneath the finger is illuminated as the user<br>
rotates their finger around the circular touch pad. In some cases, this may include<br>
moving through illumination segments, nodes or points, based on at least the<br>
acceleration value, whereby the acceleration value specifies a degree of acceleration<br>
associated with the rate at which said moving through illumination segments, nodes<br>
or points is to be achieved.<br><br>
[00146]	Fig. 24 is a method 800 of operating an illuminated touch pad, in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The method generally<br>
begins at block 802 where at least a portion of the input surface is illuminated with a<br>
first illumination profile when an object is detected proximate the input surface.<br>
Following block 802, the method proceeds to block 804 where the illumination of<br>
illuminated portion of the input surface changes when the object is moved. For<br>
example, the intensity of the illumination may be varied based on the acceleration of<br>
the moving object. For example, the intensity may be increased with increased<br>
acceleration and the intensity may be decreased with decreased acceleration. In<br>
another embodiment, thresholds are used. For example, a first intensity level may be<br>
used for high acceleration, a second intensity level may be used for low acceleration,<br>
and a third intensity level may be used for no acceleration (stationary).<br>
[00147]	By way of example and referring to Fig. 25, low intensity illumination<br>
is provided when a touch is first detected, medium intensity illumination is provided<br>
when the object is slowly moved around the input surface (e.g., low acceleration), and<br>
high intensity illumination is provided when the object is quickly moved around the<br>
input surface (e.g., high acceleration). Alternatively, the intensity may continuously<br>
vary according to the acceleration of the object.<br>
[00148]	While this invention has been described in terms of several preferred<br>
embodiments, there are alterations, permutations, and equivalents, which fall within<br>
the scope of this invention.<br>
[00149]	For example, although the invention was primarily directed at touch<br>
pads, it should be pointed out that this is not a limitation and that invention may be<br>
applied to other touch sensing devices as for example touch sensitive housings and<br>
touch sensing palm rests.<br>
[00150]	It should also be noted that there are many alternative ways of<br>
implementing the methods and apparatuses of the present invention.<br>
[00151]	For example, different areas of the touch pad may be illuminated with<br>
different illumination profiles at the same time. By way of example, the touch pad<br>
may be segmented into illuminated quadrants that correspond to button functionality<br>
of the touch pad such as menu, play/pause, forward and reverse.<br>
[00152]	Furthermore, the touch pad may be used as an indicator for a handheld<br>
computing device such as a media player. For example, the touch pad may be<br><br>
configured to ebb in and out when the device is in sleep mode or vary from high to<br>
low intensity based on the battery level.<br>
[00153]	Moreover, the touch pad may be used as a timer or clock. In the case<br>
of a clock, the touch pad may include segments corresponding to the position of a<br>
clock, and the segments can be illuminated in a controlled manner to indicate the<br>
current time. For example, to indicate 12:30, a 12 o'clock segment may be<br>
illuminated with a first illumination profile and 6 o'clock segment may be illuminated<br>
with a second illumination profile. In the case of a timer, the touch pad may be used<br>
to show how much time is left in a playing media item such as a song. For example,<br>
the entire touch pad may be illuminated when the song starts and consecutive<br>
segments may be turned off as the song plays. When the song is over, the touch pad<br>
is no longer illuminated. Alternatively, consecutive segments may be turned on as<br>
the song plays until the song is over and the touch pad is fully illuminated. The may<br>
be useful in a media player such as a music player.<br>
[00154]	In addition, the illumination of the touch pad may be further controlled<br>
by a sensor such as a light sensor. The light sensor measures the ambient light level,<br>
and the intensity of the illumination is adjusted based on the ambient light level.<br>
[00155]	It is therefore intended that the following appended claims be<br>
interpreted as including all such alterations, permutations, and equivalents as fall<br>
within the true spirit and scope of the present invention.<br><br>
