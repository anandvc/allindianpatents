ADDITIVES FOR LITHIUM SECONDARY BATTERY<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a lithium secondary battery, preferably a high-voltage battery with charge-cutoff voltages over 4.35V, which has improved high-temperature cycle characteristics, safety and high-temperature storage characteristics. More particularly, the present invention relates to a lithium secondary battery using an electrolyte comprising a compound with a reaction potential of 4.7V or higher in addition to a nitrile group-containing compound, wherein the compound with a reaction potential of 4.7V or higher solves the problems of a battery swelling phenomenon and drop in the recovery capacity under high-temperature storage conditions, such problems being caused by the nitrile group-containing compound used in the electrolyte for improving the high-temperature cycle characteristics and safety.<br>
Background Art<br>
Recently, as electronic devices become smaller and lighter, batteries used therein as power sources are increasingly required to have a compact size and light weight. As rechargeable batteries with a compact size, light weight and high capacity, lithium secondary batteries have been put to practical use and widely used in portable electronic and communication devices such as compact camcorders, portable phones, notebook PCs, etc.<br>
A lithium secondary battery comprises a cathode, anode and an electrolyte. Such lithium secondary<br>
1<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/001557<br>
RO/KR 26.07.2005<br>
batteries . are capable of repeated charge/discharge cycles, because lithium ions deintercalated from a cathode active material upon the first charge cycle are intercalated into-an anode active material (for example, carbon particles) and deintercalated again during a discharge cycle, so that lithium ions reciprocate between both electrodes while transferring energy.<br>
Generally, in order to convert a lithium secondary battery having a charge cut-off voltage of 4.2V into a high-capacity, high-output and high-voltage battery having a charge-cutoff voltage of 4.35V or higher, it is necessary to increase the theoretically available capacity of the cathode active material in the battery. Methods of increasing .the available capacity of a cathode active material include a method of doping a cathode active -material with transition metals or non-transition metals such as aluminum and magnesium or a method of increasing the charge-cutoff voltage of a battery. It is possible to increase the available capacity of a cathode active material by 15% or more by increasing the charge-cutoff voltage of a lithium secondary battery to 4.35V or higher. However, because the reactivity between a cathode and electrolyte also increases, degradation of the cathode surface and oxidation, of the electrolyte may occur, resulting in degradation in high-temperature cycle characteristics, safety and high-temperature storage characteristics of the battery.<br>
Meanwhile, a lithium secondary battery having a charge-cutoff voltage of 4.2V according to the prior art uses an overcharge inhibiting agent such as<br>
2<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/001557<br>
RO/KR 26.07.2005<br>
cyclohexylbenzene (CHB) or biphenyl (BP) in order to improve the battery safety and to prevent side reactions between a cathode and electrolyte by forming a coating layer on the cathode under high-temperature storage conditions. However, when additives having a reaction potential of about 4.6V (for example, CHP or BP) are used in a high-voltage battery having a charge-cutoff voltage of 4.35V or higher, cycle characteristics of the battery may be degraded rapidly at room temperature and high temperature. Additionally, such additives may be decomposed excessively under high-temperature storage conditions to form a thick insulator film preventing movements of lithium ions on the cathode, so that any recovery capacity cannot be obtained.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
We have first recognized that when a nitrile group-containing compound, particularly an aliphatic clinitrile compound, is used as additive for electrolyte in order to prevent degradation in safety and quality of a high-voltage battery having a charge-cutoff voltage of 4.35V or higher, there are problems of a battery swelling phenomenon and a significant drop in recovery capacity under high-temperature storage conditions.<br>
Additionally, we have also found that when a compound having a reaction potential of 4.7V or higher, for example a fluorotoluene compound, is added to an electrolyte containing a nitrile group-containing compound added thereto, it is possible to prevent the problems of a battery swelling phenomenon and a significant drop in capacity under high-temperature storage conditions, the problems being caused by the nitrile-group containing compound used for the purpose of improving high-temperature cycle characteristics and safety of the battery.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a lithium secondary battery having excellent high-temperature cycle characteristics and safety and improved high-temperature storage characteristics.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a lithium secondary battery comprising a cathode (C), an anode (A), a separator and an<br>
5<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/001557<br>
RO/KR 26.07.2005<br>
electrolyte, wherein the electrolyte comprises (a) a nitrile group-containing compound, and (b) a compound having a reaction potential of 4.7V or higher.<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be explained in more detail.<br>
The lithium secondary battery according to the present invention is characterized by using .a nitrile group-containing compound combined with a fluorotoluene compound in an electrolyte for a conventional lithium secondary battery (preferably, a high-voltage battery having charge-cutoff voltages over 4.35V).<br>
Due to the above characteristics of the present invention, the lithium secondary battery according to the present invention can show improved overall qualities including high-temperature cycle characteristics and high-temperature storage characteristics simultaneously with improved safety.<br>
(1) In the lithium secondary battery according to the present invention, the nitrile group-containing compound used in the electrolyte can improve the battery quality at high-temperature as well as the battery safety.<br>
The highly polar nitrile group (-CN) present in the nitrile group-containing compound used in the present invention can be bonded with the surface of a cathode at high temperature, thereby forming a complex. The complex formed as descried above can serve as protection film for masking the active sites of the cathode surface, and thus can prevent transition metals from being partially dissolved out during repeated charge-discharge cycles to be precipitated on the anode.<br>
6<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/001557<br>
RO/KR 26.07.2005<br>
Additionally, it is possible to inhibit side reactions between an electrolyte and cathode followed by gas generation and to cause lithium ions to be intercalated/deintercalated smoothly even at high temperature, and thus to prevent degradation in cycle life characteristics.<br>
Further, the nitrile group-containing compound inhibits the heat generated from the reaction between an electrolyte and cathode and from the structural collapse of a cathode, and reduces the calorific value caused by the heat. Therefore, it is possible to prevent accelerated combustion of an electrolyte and a thermal runaway phenomenon caused by the oxygen emitted from the structural collapse of a cathode due to overcharge conditions, internal short-circuit or high-temperature conditions, and thus to prevent ignition and explosion of the battery.<br>
(2) When the electrolyte containing the nitrile group-containing compound added thereto is used in a lithium secondary battery, preferably in a lithium secondary battery having a charge-cutoff voltage of 4.35V or higher, it is possible to improve high-temperature cycle characteristics and safety of the battery. However, there is a problem in that when the battery is stored at high temperature for a long time, the battery may be swelled (i.e., thickness of the battery may be increased) due to gas generation, resulting in a drop in the recovery capacity.<br>
On the contrary, according to the present invention, a fluorotoluene compound (for example, 2-fluorotoluene (2-FT) and/or 3-fluorotoluene (3-FT))<br>
7<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/001557<br>
RO/KR 26.07.2005<br>
having a reaction potential of 4.7V or higher is used in an electrolyte in addition to the nitrile group-containing compound. Because such fluorotoluene compounds have a high reaction potential and experience little change in reaction potentials during repeated cycles, it is possible to prevent decomposition of additives at a range of between 4.35V and 4.6V and the so-called swelling phenomenon of the high-voltage battery and to minimize a drop in recovery capacity. Therefore, according to the present invention, it is possible to obtain synergy of the effects resulting from the nitrile group-containing compound with the effect of improvement in high-temperature storage characteristics.<br>
(3) Further, When the above additives for an electrolyte are used, it is possible to reduce a contact surface area where side reactions between a cathode and electrolyte may occur in case of the battery containing only conventional electrolyte, and thus to improve the battery safety.<br>
One additive component of the electrolyte according to the present invention is a nitrile group (-CN)-containing compound.<br>
Particular examples of the nitrile group-containing compound that may be used include both aliphatic and " aromatic nitrile group-containing compounds, mononitrile and dinitrile compounds having 1 or 2 nitrile groups being preferable. Particularly, aliphatic dinitrile compounds are preferable.<br>
The aliphatic dinitrile compounds are C1-C12 linear or branched dinitrile compounds having one or more substituents. Non-limiting examples thereof include<br>

succinonitrile, sebaconitrile, glutaronitrile,<br>

dimethylglutaronitrile,	2,2,4,4-<br>
tetramethylglutaronitrile, 1,4-dicyanopentane, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-hexanedicarbonitrile, 2,6-dicyanoheptane, 2,7-dicyanooctane, 2,8-dicyanononane, 1,6-dicyanodecane, or the like. More particularly, succinonitrile or sebaconitrile are preferable.<br>
The nitrile group-containing compound is used in the electrolyte in an amount depending on its solubility in the solvent for the electrolyte. However, the nitrile group-containing compound used in the electrolyte preferably in an amount of between 0.1 and 10 wt% based on 100 wt% of the electrolyte. When the compound is used in an amount of less than 0.1 wt%, it is not possible to improve battery safety significantly. On the other hand, when the compound is used in an amount of greater than 10 wt%, the viscosity of the electrolyte excessively increases, resulting in degradation in the battery quality at room temperature and low temperature.<br>
Another additive component of the electrolyte according to the present invention is a compound having a reaction potential of 4. 7V or higher. There is no particular limitation in the compound, as long as it is a compound having a reaction potential of 4.7V or higher. Preferably, the additive is a fluorotoluene (FT) compound. Non-limiting examples of fluorotoluene compounds include a monofluorotoluene, difluorotoluene,<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/001557<br>
RO/KR 26.07.2005<br>
trifluorotoluene, or the like. Among those, 2-fluorotoluene (2-FT) and/or 3-fluorotoluene (3-FT) are more preferable, because they have high reaction potentials and experience little change in reaction potentials during repeated cycles.<br>
Because 2-fluorotoluene and/or 3-fluorotoluene are physically stable and have such a high boiling point as to prevent thermal decomposition as well as a high reaction potential of 4.7V or higher (the reaction potential being higher than the reaction potential of CHB or BP by about 0.IV), they can improve high-temperature storage characteristics and safety of a battery using an electrolyte comprising them as additives, contrary to conventional additives such as CHP and BP. Additionally, because they experience little change in reaction potentials during repeated cycles, as compared to conventional fluorotoluene compounds, they can prevent degradation in cycle characteristics of a high-voltage battery.<br>
In fact, when a fluorotoluene compound other than 2-fluorotoluene and 3-fluorotoluene, or 4-fluorotolune (4-FT) having a reaction potential similar to that of CHB is used, a battery having a charge-cutoff voltage of 4.35V or higher shows significant degradation in cycle characteristics'during repeated cycles due to a reaction of a cathode active material with a fluorine atom substituted in the para-position. Therefore, it is not possible to improve the safety and high-temperature storage characteristics of a battery.<br>
Preferably, the compound having a reaction potential of 4.7V or higher {for example, 2-FT and/or 3-<br>
10<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/001557<br>
RO/KR 26.07.2005<br>
FT) is added to an electrolyte in an amount of between 0.1 and 10 wt% based on 100 wt% of the total weight of electrolyte. When .the compound is used in an amount of less than 0.1 wt%, it is not possible to improve the high temperature storage characteristics of a battery significantly. When the compound is used in an amount of greater than 10 wt%, there are problems in that viscosity of the electrolyte decreases and the additive causes an exothermic reaction to emit heat excessively.<br>
The electrolyte for batteries, to which the above additive compounds are added, comprises components currently used in electrolytes, for example an electrolyte salt and organic solvent.<br>
The electrolyte salt that may be used in the present invention includes a salt represented by the formula of A+B-, wherein A4 represents an alkali metal cation selected from the group consisting of Li+, Na4, K4 and combinations thereof, and B- represents an anion selected from the group consisting of PF6-, BF4-, Cl-, Br-, I-, ClO4, ASF6-, CH3CO2-, CF3SO3-, N(CF3SO2)2~, C(CF2SO2)3~ and combinations thereof. Particularly, a lithium salt is preferably used.<br>
Non-limiting examples of the organic solvent include propylene carbonate {PC), ethylene carbonate (EC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), dipropyl carbonate (DPC), dimethyl sulfoxide, acetonitrile, dimethoxyethane, diethoxyethane, tetrahydrofuran, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), ethylmethyl carbonate (EMC), gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) or mixtures thereof.<br>
As generally known in the art, the lithium<br>
11<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/001557<br>
RO/KR 26.07.2005<br>
secondary battery comprises a cathode (C), an anode (A), a electrolyte and a separator, wherein the electrolyte comprises the above-described additives.<br>
Such lithium secondary batteries include secondary lithium metal batteries, secondary lithium ion batteries, secondary lithium polymer batteries, secondary lithium ion polymer batteries, etc. Additionally, the present invention may be applied to not only conventional lithium secondary batteries having a charge-cutoff voltage of 4.2V but also high-voltage batteries having a charge-cutoff voltage of 4.35V or higher. Particularly, high-voltage batteries having a charge-cutoff voltage of between 4.35V and 4.6V are preferable.<br>
According to the present invention, the range of charge-cutoff voltages of the lithium secondary battery may be controlled in order to provide high-voltage batteries having a charge-cutoff voltage of 4.35V or higher, preferably of between 4.35V and 4,6V. Otherwise, cathode active materials used in the lithium secondary batteries may be doped or substituted with another element, or may be surface-treated with a chemically stable substance.<br>
More particularly, the lithium secondary battery according to the present invention has a charge-cutoff voltage of 4.35V or higher, preferably of between 4.35V and 4.6V. When the battery has a charge-cutoff voltage of lower than 4.35V, it is substantially the same as a conventional 4.2V-battery and does not show an increase in the available capacity of a cathode active material so that a high-capacity battery cannot be designed and<br>
12<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/001557<br>
RO/KR 26.07.2005<br>
obtained. Additionally, when the battery has a charge-cutoff voltage of higher than 4.6V, the cathode active material used in the battery may experience a rapid change in structure due to the presence of the H13 phase generated in the cathode active material. In this case, there are problems in that transition metal is dissolved out of lithium transition metal composite oxide used as cathode active material and oxygen loss may occur. Further, as the charge-cutoff voltage increases, reactivity between the cathode and electrolyte also increases, resulting in problems including explosion of the battery.<br>
The anode active material that may be used in the high-voltage lithium secondary battery having a charge-cutoff voltage of 4.35V or higher according to the present invention includes conventional anode active materials known to one skilled in the art(for example, materials capable of lithium ion intercalation/ deintercalation). There is no particular limitation in selection of the anode active material. Non-limiting examples of the anode active material include lithium alloys, carbonaceous materials, inorganic oxides, inorganic chalcogenides, nitrides, metal complexes or organic polymer compounds. Particularly preferred are amorphous or crystalline carbonaceous materials.<br>
The cathode active material that may be used in the high-voltage lithium secondary battery having a charge-cutoff voltage of 4.35V or higher according to the present invention includes conventional cathode active materials known to one skilled in the art (for example, lithium-containing composite oxides having at<br>
13<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/001557<br>
RO/KR 26.07.2005<br>
least one element selected from the group consisting of alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, Group 13 elements, Group 14 elements, Group 15 elements, transition metals and rare earth elements). There is no particular limitation in selection of the cathode active material. Non-limiting examples of the cathode active material include various types of lithium transition metal composite oxides (for example, lithium manganese composite oxides such as LiMn2O4; lithium nickel oxides such as LiNiO2; lithium cobalt oxides such as LiCo02; lithium iron oxides; the above-described oxides in which manganese, nickel, cobalt or iron is partially doped or substituted with other transition metals or non-transition metals (for example, Al, Mg, Zr, Fe, Zn, Ga, Si, Ge or combinations thereof); lithium-containing vanadium oxides; and chalcogenides (for example, manganese dioxide, titanium disulfide, molybdenum disulfide, etc.).<br>
As cathode active material, lithium cobalt composite oxides optionally doped with Al, Mg, Zr, Fe, Zn, Ga, Sn, Si and/or Ge are preferable and LiCo02 is more preferable.<br>
In the high-voltage battery having a charge-cutoff voltage of 4.35V or higher according to the present invention, the weight ratio (A/C) of anode active material (A) to cathode active material (C) per unit area of each electrode ranges suitably from 0.44 to 0.70 and more preferably from 0.5 to 0.64. When the weight ratio is less than 0.44, the battery is substantially the same as a conventional 4.2V-battery. Therefore, when the battery is overcharged to 4.35V or higher, the<br>
14<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/001557<br>
RO/KR 26.07.2005<br>
capacity balance may be broken to cause dendrite growth on the surface of anode, resulting in short-circuit in the battery and a rapid drop in the battery capacity. When the weight ratio is greater than 0.64, an excessive amount of lithium sites exists undesirably in the anode, resulting in a drop in energy density per unit volume/mass of the battery.<br>
According to the present invention, such controlled weight ratio of anode active material to cathode active material per unit area of each electrode can be obtained preferably by using LiCo02, LiNiMnCo02 or LiNiMnO2 having a capacity similar to that of LiCo02, etc., as cathode active material and using graphite as anode active material. When high-capacity cathode materials such as Ni-containing materials and/or high-capacity anode materials such as Si are used, it is possible to design and manufacture an optimized lithium secondary battery having high capacity, high output and improved safety through recalculation of the weight ratio considering a different capacity. However, the scope of the present invention is not limited to the above-mentioned cathode active materials and anode active materials.<br>
The cathode active material used in the lithium secondary battery according to the present invention (for example, LiCo02) have a problem in that they are deteriorated in terms of thermal properties when being charged to 4.35V or higher. To prevent the problem, it is possible to control the specific surface area of the cathode active material.<br>
As the particle size of the cathode active<br>
15<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/001557<br>
RO/KR 26.07.2005<br>
material increases (in other words, as the specific surface area of the cathode active material decreases), reactivity between the cathode active material and electrolyte may decrease, resulting in improvement in thermal stability. For this reason, it is preferable to use a cathode active material having a particle diameter larger than that of a currently used cathode active material. Therefore, the cathode active material used in the battery according to the present invention preferably has a particle diameter (particle size) of between 5 and 30 j^m. When the cathode active material has a particle diameter of less than 5 j^i, side reactions between the cathode and electrolyte increase to cause the problem of poor safety of the battery. When the cathode active material has a particle' diameter of greater than 30 ^m, reaction kinetics may be slow in the battery.<br>
Additionally, in order to prevent the degradation of reaction kinetics in the whole battery, caused by the use of a cathode active material having a particle diameter greater than that of a currently used cathode active material, it is possible to control the loading amount of cathode active material and anode active material per unit area of each electrode.<br>
It is preferable that the loading amount of cathode active material per unit area of cathode ranges from 10 to 30 mg/cm2. When the loading amount of cathode active material is less than 10 mg/cm2, the battery may be degraded in terms of capacity and efficiency. When the loading amount of cathode active material is greater than 30 mg/cm2, thickness of the cathode increases,<br>
16<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/001557<br>

resulting in degradation of reaction kinetics in the battery. Additionally, it is preferable that the loading amount of anode active material per unit area of anode ranges from 4 ..4 to 21 mg/cm2. When the loading amount of anode active material is less than 4.4 mg/cm2, capacity balance cannot be maintained, thereby causing degradation in battery safety. When the loading amount of anode active material is greater than 21 mg/cm2, an excessive amount of lithium sites is present, undesirably in the anode, resulting in a drop in energy density per unit volume/mass of the battery.<br>
The electrode used in the battery according to the present invention can be manufactured by a conventional process known to one skilled in the art. In one embodiment, slurry for each electrode is applied onto a current collector formed of metal foil, followed by rolling and drying.<br>
Slurry for each electrode, i.e., slurry for a cathode and an anode may be obtained by mixing the above-described cathode active material/anode active material with a binder and dispersion medium. Each of the slurry for a cathode and anode preferably contains a small amount of conductive agent.<br>
There is no particular limitation in the conductive agent, as long as the conductive agent is an electroconductive material that experiences no chemical change in the battery using the same.

Experimental Example 2. Evaluation for safety of lithium secondary battery<br>
The following tests were performed to evaluate the lithium secondary battery having a charge-cutoff voltage of 4.35V or higher according to the present invention for its safety.<br>
2-1. Overcharge test<br>
The lithium secondary battery using succinonitrile and 3-fluorotoluene as additives for electrolyte according to Example 1 was used as sample. As controls, the battery using no additive for electrolyte according to Comparative Example 1 and the battery using succinonitrile as additive for electrolyte according to Comparative Example 2 were used.<br>
Each battery was charged under the conditions of 6V/1A, 12V/1A and 10V/1A and then checked.<br>
After checking, the battery using the electrolyte containing no additive for electrolyte according to Comparative Example 1 showed a rapid increase in the battery temperature under overcharge conditions, resulting in ignition and explosion of the battery {see, FIGs. 3 and 4). On'the contrary, each lithium secondary battery using the electrolyte containing succinonitrile as additive showed excellent safety under overcharge conditions (see, FIGs. 5 and 6).<br>
2-2. Hot box test<br>
The lithium secondary battery using succinonitrile and 3-fluorotoluene as additives for electrolyte according to Example 1 was used as sample. As controls,<br>
23<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/001557<br>
RO/KR 26.07.2005<br>
the battery using no additive for electrolyte according to Comparative Example 1 and the battery using succinonitrile as additive for electrolyte according to Comparative Example 2 were used.<br>
Each of the batteries according to Example 1 and Comparative Example 2 was charged to 4. 5V under 1C for 2.5 hours and then maintained under the constant voltage •condition. Then, each battery was introduced into an oven capable of convection, warmed from room temperature to a high temperature of 150*C at a rate of 5°C/min., and exposed to such high-temperature conditions for 1 hour. Additionally, each battery was checked for explosion. The battery according to Comparative Example 1 was charged to 4.4V under 1C for 2.5 hours and then maintained under the constant voltage condition, followed by the same procedure as described above.<br>
After the experiment, the lithium secondary battery according to Comparative Example 1, using no additive for electrolyte and charged to 4.4V, ignited in this hot box test (see, Table 7) . On the contrary, the lithium secondary batteries using succinonitrile as additive for electrolyte according the Example 1 and Comparative Example 2 showed excellent safety even under such conditions that they were charged to 4. 5V. Therefore, it can be seen that succinonitrile can contribute to the improvement of battery safety {see, FIGs. 8 and 9).<br>
Experimental Example 3. Evaluation for high-temperature storage characteristics of lithium secondary battery<br>
The high-voltage lithium secondary battery having<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/001557<br>
RO/KR 26.07.2005<br>
a charge-cutoff voltage of 4.35V or higher was evaluated in the following high-temperature storage tests.<br>
4-1. Long-term high-temperature storage test (Siemens thermal cycle)<br>
The lithium secondary battery using succinonitrile and 3-fluorotoluene as additives for electrolyte according to Example 1 was used as sample. As controls,<br>
the batteries using succinonitrile and sebaconitrile as ii<br>
additives for electrolyte according to Comparative Examples 2 and 3, respectively, were used.<br>
Each battery was charged at a charging current of 1C to 4.35V (wherein each battery was'maintained at the constant voltage until the electric current dropped to 18 mA) , and was discharged to 3.1V with GSM pulse to determine the initial discharge capacity. Next, each battery was recharged to 4.35V using the same conditions as described above, and was subjected to 30 storage cycles (1 cycle= 3-hour storage at 80-Q/7-hour storage at 25°C) . After 30 cycles, each battery was measured for thickness, variations in open circuit voltage (OCV) and impedance. Then, each battery was discharged under GSM pulse conditions to determine the residual capacity of each battery. After measuring the residual capacity, each battery was subjected to three charge/discharge cycles and measured for the GSM recovery capacity.<br>
After the experiment, the lithium secondary battery having a charge-cutoff voltage of 4.35V and using succinonitrile and 3-fluorotoluene as additives for electrolyte according to Example 1 showed a significantly low swelling phenomenon compared to the batteries using succinonitrile and sebaconitrile as<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/001557<br>
RO/KR 26.07.2005<br>
additives for electrolyte according to Comparative Example 2 and Comparative Example 3, respectively. Therefore, the lithium secondary battery according to the present invention showed improved long-term high-temperature storage characteristics (see, FIG. 10).<br>
3-2. Long-term high-temperature storage test (80°C/ 5 days: Siemens storage)<br>
The lithium secondary battery using succinonitrile and 3-fluorotoluene as additives for electrolyte according to Example 1 was used as sample. As controls, the batteries using succinonitrile and sebaconitrile as additives for electrolyte according to Comparative Examples 2 and 3, respectively, were used.<br>
Experimental Example 3-1 (Siemens thermal cycle) was repeated to measure the recovery capacity of each battery, except that each battery was stored at 80°C for 5 days.<br>
After the experiment, the batteries according to Comparative Examples 2 and 3 showed a significant battery swelling phenomenon after being stored at 80°C for 5 days (see, FIG. 11) . This indicates that when a nitrile group-containing compound such as succinonitrile or sebaconitrile was used in a high-voltage battery having a charge-cutoff voltage of 4.35V or higher as additive for electrolyte, the battery shows improved safety and high-temperature cycle characteristics, however, it shows a drop in the recovery capacity because the dinitrile compound is decomposed under the high-temperature storage conditions to form a thick insulation film, resulting in a battery swelling phenomenon. On the contrary, the lithium secondary<br>
26<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/001557<br>
RO/KR 26.07.2005<br>
battery having a charge-cutoff voltage of 4.35V and using succinonitrile and 3-fluorotoluene as additives for electrolyte according to Example 1 showed no swelling even after being stored at 80°C for a long time (see, FIG. 11)<br>
Therefore, it can be seen that a f luorotoluene compound having a reaction potential of 4. 7V or higher can solve the problem related with high-temperature storage characteristics, caused by a nitrile group-containing compound used as additive for electrolyte in order to improve the high-temperature cycle characteristics and safety of a high-voltage battery having a charge-cutoff voltage of 4.35V or higher.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As can be seen from the foregoing, the lithium secondary battery according to the present invention can prevent the problems caused by a nitrile group-containing compound added to and electrolyte for the purpose of improving high-temperature cycle characteristics and safety {such problems as a battery swelling phenomenon and a drop in recovery capacity under high-temperature storage conditions) , by adding a compound having a reaction potential of 4.7V or higher.<br>
