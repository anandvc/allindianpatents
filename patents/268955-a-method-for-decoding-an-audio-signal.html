METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DECODING AN AUDIO SIGNAL<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to an audio signal<br>
processing, and more particularly, to an apparatus for<br>
decoding an audio signal and method thereof.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
Generally, in case of an audio signal, an audio<br>
signal encoding apparatus compresses the audio signal into<br>
a mono or stereo type downmix signal instead of compressing<br>
each multi-channel audio signal. The audio signal encoding<br>
apparatus transfers the compressed downmix signal to a<br>
decoding apparatus together with a spatial information<br>
signal or stores the compressed downmix signal and a<br>
spatial information signal in a storage medium. In this<br>
case, a spatial information signal, which Is extracted in<br>
downmixing a multi-channel audio signal, is used in<br>
restoring an original multi-channel audio signal from a<br>
downmix signal.<br>
Configuration information is non-changeable in<br>
general and a header including this information is inserted<br>
in an audio signal once. Since configuration information is<br>
i<br><br>
transmitted by being initially inserted in an audio signal<br>
once, an audio signal decoding apparatus has a problem in<br>
decoding spatial information due to non-existence of<br>
configuration information in case of reproducing the audio<br>
signal from a random timing point.<br>
An audio signal encoding apparatus generates a<br>
downmix signal and a spatial information signal into<br>
bitstreams together or respectively and then transfers them<br>
to the audio signal decoding apparatus. So, if unnecessary<br>
information and the like are included in the spatial<br>
information signal, signal compression and transfer<br>
efficiencies are reduced.<br>
[Disclosure]<br>
[Technical Problem]<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an<br>
apparatus for decoding an audio signal and method thereof,<br>
by which the audio signal can be reproduced from a random<br>
timing point by selectively including a spatial information<br>
signal in a header.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide<br>
an apparatus for decoding an audio signal and method<br>
thereof, by which a position of a timeslot to which a<br>
parameter set will be applied can be efficiently<br>
2<br><br>
represented using a variable bit number.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide<br>
an apparatus for decoding an audio signal and method<br>
thereof, by which audio signal compression and transfer<br>
efficiencies can be raised by representing an information<br>
quantity required for performing a downmix signal<br>
arrangement or mapping multi-channel to a speaker as a<br>
minimal variable bit number.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to<br>
provide an apparatus for decoding an audio signal and<br>
method thereof, by which an information quantity required<br>
for signal arrangement can be reduced by mapping multi-<br>
channel to a speaker without performing downmix signal<br>
arrangement.	...<br>
[Technical Solution]<br>
The aforesaid objectives, features and advantages of<br>
the invention will be set forth in the description which<br>
follows, and in part will be apparent from the description.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention which are capable of<br>
the aforesaid objectives will be set forth referring<br>
drawings accompanied.<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to one preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention, examples of which are<br>
3<br><br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 is a conf igurational diagram of an audio<br>
signal transferred to an audio signal decoding apparatus<br>
from an audio signal encoding apparatus according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, an audio signal includes an<br>
audio descriptor 101, a downmix signal 103 and a spatial<br>
information signal 105.<br>
In case of using a coding scheme for reproducing an<br>
audio signal for broadcasting or the like, the audio signal<br>
is able to include ancillary data as well as the audio<br>
descriptor 101 and the downmix signal 103. And, the present<br>
invention includes the spatial information signal 105 as<br>
the ancillary data. In order for an audio signal decoding<br>
apparatus to know basic information of audio codec without<br>
analyzing an audio signal, the audio signal is able to<br>
selectively include the audio descriptor 101. The audio<br>
descriptor 101 is configured with small number of basic<br>
informations necessary for audio decoding such as a<br>
transmission rate of a transmitted audio signal, a number<br>
of channels, a sampling frequency of compressed data, an<br>
identifier indicating a currently used codec and the like.<br>
An audio signal decoding apparatus is able to know a<br>
type of a codec done to an audio signal using the audio<br>
4<br><br>
descriptor 101. In particular, using the audio descriptor<br>
101, the audio signal decoding apparatus is able to know<br>
whether an audio signal configures multi-channel using the<br>
spatial information signal 105 and the downmix signal 103.<br>
The audio descriptor 101 is located independently from the<br>
downmix signal 103 or the spatial information signal 105<br>
included in the audio signal. For instance, the audio<br>
descriptor 101 is located within a separate field<br>
indicating an audio signal. In case that a header is not<br>
included in the downmix signal 103, the audio signal<br>
decoding apparatus is able to decode the downmix signal 103<br>
using the audio descriptor 101.<br>
The downmix signal 103 is a signal generated from<br>
downmixing multi-channel. And, the downmix signal 103 can<br>
be generated from a downmixing unit included in an audio<br>
signal encoding apparatus or generated artificially. The<br>
downmix signal 103 can be categorized into a case of<br>
including a header and a case of not including a header. In<br>
case that the downmix signal 103 includes a header, the<br>
header is included in each frame by a frame unit. In case<br>
that the downmix signal 103 does not include a header, as<br>
mentioned in the foregoing description, the downmix signal<br>
103 can be decoded using the audio descriptor 101. The<br>
downmix signal 103 takes either a form of including a<br>
5<br><br>
header for each frame or a form of not including a header<br>
in a frame. And, the downmix signal 103 is included in an<br>
audio signal in a same manner until contents end.<br>
The spatial information signal 105 is also<br>
categorized into a case of including a header 107 and<br>
spatial information 111 and a case of including spatial<br>
information 111 only without including a header. The header<br>
107 of the spatial information signal 105 differs from that<br>
of the downmix signal 103 in that it is unnecessary to be<br>
inserted in each frame identically. In particular, the<br>
spatial information signal 105 is able to use both a frame<br>
including a header and a frame not including a header<br>
together. Most of information included in the header 107 of<br>
the spatial information signal 105 is configuration<br>
information 109 that decodes spatial information 111 by<br>
interpreting the spatial information 111. The spatial<br>
information 111 is configured with frames each of which<br>
includes timeslots. The timeslot means each time interval<br>
in case of dividing the frame by time intervals. The number<br>
of timeslots included in one frame is included in the<br>
configuration information 109.<br>
Configuration information 109 includes signal<br>
arrangement information, the number of signal converting<br>
units, channel configuration information, speaker mapping<br>
6<br><br>
information and the like as well as the timeslot number.<br>
The signal arrangement information is an identifier<br>
that indicates whether an audio signal will be arranged for<br>
upmixing prior to restoring the decoded downmix signal 103<br>
into multi-channel.<br>
The signal converting unit means an OTT (one-to-two)<br>
box converting one downmix signal 103 to two signals or a<br>
TTT (two-to-three) box converting two downmix signals 103<br>
to three signals in generating multi-channel by upmixing<br>
the downmix signal 103. In particular, the OTT or TTT box<br>
is a conceptional box used in restoring multi-channel by<br>
being included in an upmixing unit (not shown in the<br>
drawing) of the audio signal decoding apparatus. And,<br>
information for types and number of the signal converting<br>
units is included in the spatial information signal 105.<br>
The channel configuration information is the<br>
information indicating a configuration of the upmixing unit<br>
included in the audio signal decoding apparatus. The<br>
channel configuration information includes an identifier<br>
indicating whether an audio signal passes through the<br>
signal converting unit or not. The audio signal decoding<br>
apparatus is able to know whether an audio signal inputted<br>
to the upmixing unit passes through the signal converting<br>
unit or not using the channel configuration information.<br>
7<br><br>
The audio signal decoding apparatus upmixes the downmix<br>
signal 103 into a multi-channel audio signal using the<br>
information for the signal converting unit, the channel<br>
configuration information and the like. The audio signal<br>
decoding apparatus generates multi-channel by upmixing the<br>
downmix signal 103 using the signal converting unit<br>
information, the channel configuration information and the<br>
like included in the spatial information 111.<br>
The speaker mapping information is the information<br>
indicating that the multi-channel audio signal will be<br>
mapped to which speaker in outputting the multi-channel<br>
audio signals generated by upmixing to speakers,<br>
respectively. The audio signal decoding apparatus outputs<br>
the multi-channel audio signal to the corresponding speaker-<br>
using the speaker mapping information included in the<br>
configuration information 109.<br>
The spatial information 111 is the information used<br>
to give a spatial sense in generating multi-channel audio<br>
signals by the combination with the downmix signal. The<br>
spatial information includes CLDs (Channel Level<br>
Differences) indicating an energy difference between audio<br>
signals, ICCs (Interchannel Correlations) indicating close<br>
correlation or similarity between audio signals, CPCs<br>
(Channel Prediction Coefficients) indicating a coefficient<br>
8<br><br>
to predict an audio signal value using other signals and<br>
the like. And, a parameter set indicates a bundle of these<br>
parameters.<br>
And, a frame identifier indicating whether a position<br>
of a timeslot to which a parameter set is applied is fixed<br>
or not, the number of parameter set applied to one frame,<br>
position information of a timeslot to which a parameter set<br>
is applied and the like as well as the parameters are<br>
included in the spatial information 111.<br>
FIG. 2 is a flowchart of a method of decoding an<br>
audio signal according to another embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, an audio signal decoding<br>
apparatus receives a spatial information signal 105<br>
transferred in a bitstream form by an audio signal encoding<br>
apparatus (S201). The spatial information signal 105 can be<br>
transferred in a stream form separate from that of a<br>
downmix signal 103 or transferred by being included in<br>
ancillary data or extension data of the downmix signal 103.<br>
In case that the spatial information signal 105 is<br>
transferred by being combined with the downmix signal 103,<br>
a demultiplexing unit (not shown in the drawing) of an<br>
audio signal decoding apparatus separates the received<br>
audio signal into an encoded downmix signal 103 and an<br>
9<br><br>
encoded spatial information signal 105. The encoded spatial<br>
information 105 signal includes a header 107 and spatial<br>
information 111. The audio signal decoding apparatus<br>
decides whether the header 107 is included in the spatial<br>
information signal 105 (S203) .<br>
If the header 107 is included in the spatial<br>
information signal 105, the audio signal decoding apparatus<br>
extracts configuration information 109 from the header 107<br>
(S205).<br>
The audio signal decoding apparatus decides whether<br>
the configuration information is extracted from a first<br>
header 107 included in the spatial information signal 105<br>
(S207).<br>
If the configuration information 109 is extracted<br>
from the header 107 extracted first from the spatial<br>
information signal 105, the audio signal decoding apparatus<br>
decodes the configuration information 109 (S215) and<br>
decodes the spatial information 111 transferred behind the<br>
configuration information 109 according to the decoded<br>
configuration information 109.<br>
If the header 107 extracted from the audio signal is<br>
not the header 107 extracted first from the spatial<br>
information signal 105, the audio signal decoding apparatus<br>
decides whether the configuration information 109 extracted<br>
10<br><br>
from the header 107 is identical to the configuration<br>
information 109 extracted from a first header 107 (S209).<br>
If the configuration information 109 is identical to<br>
the configuration information 109 extracted from the first<br>
header 107, the audio signal decoding apparatus decodes the<br>
spatial information 111 using the decoded configuration<br>
information 109 extracted from the first header 107. If the<br>
extracted configuration information 109 is not identical to<br>
the configuration information 109 extracted from the first<br>
header 107, the audio signal decoding apparatus decides<br>
whether an error occurs in the audio signal on a transfer<br>
path from the audio signal encoding apparatus to the audio<br>
signal decoding apparatus (S211),<br>
If the configuration information 109 is variable,-the<br>
error does not occur even if the configuration information<br>
109 is not identical to the configuration information 109<br>
extracted from the first header 107. Hence, the audio<br>
signal decoding' apparatus updates the header 107 into a<br>
variable header 107 (S213) . The audio signal decoding<br>
apparatus then decodes configuration information 109<br>
extracted from the updated header 107 (S215).<br>
The audio signal decoding apparatus decodes spatial<br>
information 111 transferred behind the configuration<br>
information 109 according to the decoded configuration<br>
11<br><br>
information 109.<br>
If the configuration information 109, which is not<br>
variable, is not identical to the configuration information<br>
109 extracted from the first header 107, it means that the<br>
error occurs on the audio signal transfer path. Hence, the<br>
audio signal decoding apparatus removes the spatial<br>
information 111 included in the spatial information signal<br>
105 including the erroneous configuration information 109<br>
or corrects the error of the spatial information 111 (S217).<br>
FIG. 3 is a flowchart of a method of decoding an<br>
audio signal according to another embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, an audio signal decoding<br>
apparatus receives an audio signal including a downmix<br>
signal 103 and a spatial information signal 105 from an<br>
audio signal encoding apparatus (S301).<br>
The audio signal decoding apparatus separates the<br>
received audio signal into the spatial information signal<br>
105 and the downmix signal 103 (S303) and then sends the<br>
separated spatial information 105 and the separated downmix<br>
signal 103 to a core decoding unit (not shown in the<br>
drawing) and a spatial information decoding unit (not shown<br>
in the drawing), respectively.<br>
The audio signal decoding apparatus extracts the<br>
12<br><br>
number of timeslots and the number of parameter sets from<br>
the spatial information signal 105. The audio signal<br>
decoding apparatus finds a position of a timeslot to which<br>
a parameter set will be applied using the extracted numbers<br>
of the timeslots and the parameter sets. According to an<br>
order of the corresponding parameter set, the position of<br>
the timeslot to which the corresponding parameter set will<br>
be applied is represented as a variable bit number. And, by<br>
reducing the bit number representing the position of the<br>
timeslot to which the corresponding parameter set will be<br>
applied, it is able to efficiently represent the spatial<br>
information signal 105. And, the position of the timeslot,<br>
to which the corresponding parameter set will be applied,<br>
will be explained in detail with reference to FIG. 4 and<br>
FIG. 5.<br>
Once the timeslot position is obtained, the audio<br>
signal decoding apparatus decodes the spatial information<br>
signal 105 by applying the corresponding parameter set to<br>
the corresponding position (S305). And, the audio signal<br>
decoding apparatus decodes the downmix signal 103 in the<br>
core decoding unit (S305).<br>
The audio signal decoding apparatus is able to<br>
generate multi-channel by upmixing the decoded downmix<br>
signal 103 as it is. But the audio signal decoding<br>
13<br><br>
apparatus is able to arrange a sequence of the decoded<br>
downmix signals 103 before the audio signal decoding<br>
apparatus upmix the corresponding signals (S307).<br>
The audio signal decoding apparatus generates multi-<br>
channel using the decoded downmix signal 103 and the<br>
decoded spatial information signal 105 (S309). The audio<br>
signal decoding apparatus uses the spatial information<br>
signal 105 to generate the downmix signal 103 into multi-<br>
channel. As mentioned in the foregoing description, the<br>
spatial information signal 105 includes the number of<br>
signal converting units and channel configuration<br>
information for representing whether the downmix signal 103<br>
passes through the signal converting unit in being upmixed<br>
or is outputted without passing through the signal<br>
converting unit. The audio signal decoding apparatus<br>
upmixes the downmix signal 103 using the number of signal<br>
converting units, the channel configuration information and<br>
the like (S309) . A method of representing the channel<br>
configuration information and a method of configuring the<br>
channel configuration information using the less number of<br>
bits will be explained with reference to FIG. 6 and FIG. 7<br>
later.<br>
The audio signal decoding apparatus maps a multi-<br>
channel audio signal to a speaker in a preset sequence to<br>
14<br><br>
output the generated multi-channel audio signals (S311). In<br>
this case, as the mapped audio signal sequence increases,<br>
the bit number for mapping the multi-channel audio signal<br>
to the speaker becomes reduced. In particular, in case that<br>
numbers are given to multi-channel audio signals in order,<br>
since a first audio signal can be mapped to one of the<br>
entire speakers, an information quantity required for<br>
mapping an audio signal to a speaker is greater than that<br>
required for mapping a second or subsequent audio signal.<br>
As the second or subsequent audio signal is mapped to one<br>
of the rest of the speakers excluding the former speaker<br>
mapped with the former audio signal, the information<br>
quantity required for the mapping is reduced. In particular,<br>
by reducing the information quantity required for mapping<br>
the audio signal as the mapped audio signal sequence<br>
increases, it is able to efficiently represent the spatial<br>
information signal 105. This method is applicable to a case<br>
of arranging the downmix signals 103 in the step S307 as<br>
well.<br>
FIG. 4 is syntax of position information of a<br>
timeslot to which a parameter set is applied according to<br>
one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the syntax relates to<br>
'Framinglnfo' 401 to represent information for a number of<br>
15<br><br>
parameter sets and information for a timeslot to which a<br>
parameter set is applied.<br>
'bsFramingType' field 403 indicates whether a frame<br>
included in the spatial information signal 105 is a fixed<br>
frame or a variable frame. The fixed frame means a frame in<br>
which a timeslot position to which a parameter set will be<br>
applied is previously set. In particular, a position of a<br>
timeslot to which a parameter set will be applied is<br>
decided according to a preset rule. The variable frame<br>
means a frame in which a timeslot position to which a<br>
parameter set will be applied is not set yet. So, the<br>
variable frame further needs timeslot position information<br>
for representing a position of a timeslot to which a<br>
parameter set will be applied. In the following description,<br>
the 'bsFramingType' 403 shall be named 'frame identifier'<br>
indicating whether a frame is a fixed frame or a variable<br>
frame.<br>
In case of a variable frame, 'bsParamSlot' field 407<br>
or 411 indicates position information of a timeslot to<br>
which a parameter set will be applied. The 'bsParamSlot[0]'<br>
field 407 indicates a position of a timeslot to which a<br>
first parameter set will be applied, and the<br>
bsParamSlot[ps]' field 411 indicates a position of a<br>
timeslot to which a second or subsequent parameter set will<br>
16<br><br>
be applied. The position of the timeslot to which the first<br>
parameter set will be applied is represented as an initial<br>
value, and a position of the timeslot to which the second<br>
or subsequent parameter set will be applied is represented<br>
as a difference value 'bsDiffParamSlot[ps]' 409, i.e., a<br>
difference between bsParamSlot[ps]' and bsParamSlot [ps-<br>
1]'. In this case, "ps' means a parameter set. The first<br>
parameter set is represented as 3=0'. And, 'ps' is able<br>
to represent value ranging from 0 to a value smaller than<br>
the number of total parameter sets.<br>
(i) A timeslot position 407 or 409 to which a<br>
parameter set will be applied increases as a ps value<br>
increases (bsParamSlot[ps] &gt; bsParamSlot[ps-1]). (ii) For a<br>
first parameter set, a maximum value of a timeslot position<br>
to which a first parameter set will be applied corresponds<br>
to a value resulting from adding 1 to a difference between<br>
a timeslot number and a parameter set number and a timeslot<br>
position is represented . as an information quantity of<br>
"nBitsParamSlot(0) ' 413. (iii) For a second or subsequent<br>
parameter set, a timeslot position to which an Nth<br>
parameter set will be applied is greater by at least 1 than<br>
a timeslot position to which an (N-l)th parameter set will<br>
be applied and is even able to have a value resulting from<br>
adding a value N to a value resulting from subtracting a<br>
17<br><br>
parameter set number from a timeslot number. A timeslot<br>
position bsParamSlot [ps]' to which a second or subsequent<br>
parameter set will be applied is represented as a<br>
difference value 'bsDiffParamSlot[ps]' 409. And, this value<br>
is represented as an information quantity of<br>
nBitsParamSlot[ps]'. So, it is able to find a timeslot<br>
position to which a parameter set will be applied using the<br>
(i) to (iii).<br>
For instance, if there are ten timeslots included in<br>
one spatial frame and if there are three parameter sets, a<br>
timeslot position to which a first parameter set (ps=0)<br>
will be applied is applicable to a timeslot position<br>
resulting from adding 1 to a value resulting from<br>
subtracting a total parameter number from a total timeslot<br>
number. In particular, the corresponding position is<br>
applicable to one of timeslots belonging to a range between<br>
1 to maximum 8. By considering that a timeslot position to<br>
which a parameter set will be applied increases according<br>
to a parameter set number, it can be understood that<br>
timeslot positions to which the remaining two parameter<br>
sets are applicable are maximum 9 and 10, respectively. So,<br>
the timeslot position 407 to which the first parameter set<br>
will be applied needs three bits to indicate 1 to 8, which<br>
can be represented as ceil{log2 (k-i+1) }. In this case, xk'<br>
18<br><br>
is the number of timeslots and xi' is the number of<br>
parameters.<br>
If the timeslot position 407 to which the first<br>
parameter set will be applied is V5', the timeslot position<br>
bsParamSlot[1] ' to which the second parameter set will be<br>
applied should be selected from values between ,5+l=6'<br>
and '10-3+2=9'. In particular, the timeslot position to<br>
which the second parameter set will be applied can be<br>
represented as a value resulting from adding a difference<br>
value bsDiffParamSlot[ps]' 409 to a value resulting from<br>
adding 1 to the timeslot position to which the first<br>
parameter set will be applied. So, the difference value 409<br>
is able to correspond to 0 to 3, which can be represented<br>
as two bits. For the second or subsequent parameter set, by<br>
representing a timeslot position to which a parameter set<br>
will be applied as the difference value 409 instead of<br>
representing the timeslot position in direct, it is able to<br>
reduce the bit number. In the former example, four bits are<br>
needed to represent one of 6 to 9 in case of representing<br>
the timeslot position in direct. Yet, only two bits are<br>
needed to represent a timeslot position as the difference<br>
value.<br>
Hence, a position information indicating quantity<br>
AnBitsParamSlot(0)' or NnBitsParamSlot(ps) ' 413 or 415 of a<br>
19<br><br>
times lot to which a parameter set will be applied can be<br>
represented not as a fixed bit number but as a variable bit<br>
number.<br>
FIG. 5 is a flowchart of a method of decoding a<br>
spatial information signal by applying a parameter set to a<br>
timeslot according to another embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, an audio signal decoding<br>
apparatus receives an audio signal including a downmix<br>
signal 103 and a spatial information signal 105 (S501).<br>
If a header 107 exists in the spatial information<br>
signal, the audio signal decoding apparatus extracts the<br>
number of timeslots included in a frame from configuration<br>
information 109 included in the header 107 (S503) . If a<br>
header 107 is not included in the spatial information<br>
signal 105, the audio signal decoding apparatus extracts<br>
the number of timeslots from the configuration information<br>
109 included in a previously extracted header 107.<br>
The audio signal decoding apparatus extracts the<br>
number of parameter sets to be applied to a frame from the<br>
spatial information signal 105 (S505).<br>
The audio signal decoding apparatus decides whether<br>
positions of timeslots, to which parameter sets will be<br>
applied, in a frame are fixed or variable using a frame<br>
20<br><br>
identifier included in the spatial information signal 105<br>
(S507) .<br>
If the frame is a fixed frame, the audio signal<br>
decoding apparatus decodes the spatial information signal<br>
105 by applying the parameter set to the corresponding slot<br>
according to a preset rule (S513) .<br>
If the frame is a variable frame, the audio signal<br>
decoding apparatus extracts information for a timeslot<br>
position to which a first parameter set will be applied<br>
(S509). As mentioned in the foregoing description, the<br>
timeslot position to which the first parameter will be<br>
applied can maximally be a value resulting from adding 1 to<br>
a difference between the timeslot number and the parameter<br>
set. number.<br>
The audio signal decoding apparatus obtains<br>
information for a timeslot position to which a second or<br>
subsequent parameter 'set will be applied using the<br>
information for the timeslot position to which the first<br>
parameter set will be applied (S511). If N is a natural<br>
number equal to or greater than 2, a timeslot position to<br>
which a parameter set will be applied can be represented as<br>
a minimum bit number using a fact that a timeslot position<br>
to which an Nth parameter set will be applied is greater by<br>
at least 1 than a timeslot position to which an (N-l)th<br>
21<br><br>
parameter set will be applied and even can have a value<br>
resulting from adding N to a value resulting from<br>
subtracting the parameter set number from the timeslot<br>
number.<br>
And, the audio signal decoding apparatus decodes the<br>
spatial information signal 105 by applying the parameter<br>
set to the obtained timeslot position (S513).<br>
FIG. 6 and FIG. 7 are diagrams of an upmixing unit of<br>
an audio signal decoding apparatus according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
An audio signal decoding apparatus separates an audio<br>
signal received from an audio signal encoding apparatus<br>
into a downmix signal 103 and a spatial information signal<br>
105 and then decodes the downmix signal 103 and the spatial<br>
information signal 105 respectively. As mentioned in the<br>
foregoing description, the audio signal decoding apparatus<br>
decodes the spatial information signal 105 by applying a<br>
parameter to a timeslot. And, the audio signal decoding<br>
apparatus generates multi-channel audio signals using the<br>
decoded downmix signal 103 and the decoded spatial<br>
information signal 105.<br>
If the audio signal encoding apparatus compresses N<br>
input channels into M audio signals and transfers the M<br>
audio signals in a bitstream form to the audio signal<br>
22<br><br>
decoding apparatus, the audio signal decoding apparatus<br>
restores and output the original N channels. This<br>
configuration is called an N-M-N structure. In some cases,<br>
if the audio signal decoding apparatus is unable to restore<br>
the N channels, the downrnix signal 103 is outputted into<br>
two stereo signals without considering the spatial<br>
information signal 105. Yet, this will not be further<br>
discussed. A structure, in which values of N and M are<br>
fixed, shall be called a fixed channel structure. A<br>
structure, in which values of M and N are represented as<br>
random values, shall be called a random channel structure.<br>
In case of such a fixed channel structure as 5-1-5, 5-2-5,<br>
7-2-7 and the like, the audio signal encoding apparatus<br>
transfers an audio signal by having a channel structure<br>
included in the audio signal. The audio signal decoding<br>
apparatus then decodes the audio signal by reading the<br>
channel structure.<br>
The audio signal decoding apparatus uses an upmixing<br>
unit including a signal converting unit to restore M audio<br>
signals into N multi-channel. The signal converting unit is<br>
a conceptional box used to convert one downrnix signal 103<br>
to two signals or convert two downrnix signals 103 to three<br>
signals in generating multi-channel by upmixing downrnix<br>
signals 103.<br>
23<br><br>
The audio signal decoding apparatus is able to obtain<br>
information for a structure of the upmixing unit by<br>
extracting channel configuration information from the<br>
configuration information 109 included in the spatial<br>
information signal 105. As mentioned in the foregoing<br>
description, the channel configuration information is the<br>
information indicating a configuration of the upmixing unit<br>
included in the audio signal decoding apparatus. The<br>
channel configuration information includes an identifier<br>
that indicates whether an audio signal passes through the<br>
signal converting unit. In particular, the channel<br>
configuration information can be represented as a<br>
segmenting identifier since the numbers of input and output<br>
signals of the signal converting unit are changed in case<br>
that a decoded downmix signal passes through the signal<br>
converting unit in the upmixing unit.- And, the channel<br>
configuration information can be represented as a non-<br>
segmenting identifier since an input signal of the signal<br>
converting unit is outputted intact in case that a decoded<br>
downmix signal does not pass through the signal converting<br>
unit included in the upmixing unit. In the present<br>
invention, the segmenting identifier shall be represented<br>
as '1' and the non-segmenting identifier shall be<br>
represented as '0'.<br>
24<br><br>
The channel configuration information can be<br>
represented in two ways, a horizontal method and a vertical<br>
method,<br>
In the horizontal method, if an audio signal passes<br>
through a signal converting unit, i.e., if channel<br>
configuration information is yl', whether a lower layer<br>
signal outputted via the signal converting unit passes<br>
through another signal converting unit is sequentially<br>
indicated by the segmenting or non-segmenting identifier.<br>
If channel configuration information is ,0', whether a next<br>
audio signal of a same or upper layer passes through a<br>
signal converting unit is indicated by the segmenting or<br>
non-segmenting identifier.<br>
In the vertical method, whether each of entire audio<br>
signals of an upper layer passes through a signal<br>
converting unit is sequentially indicated by the segmenting<br>
or non-segmenting identifier regardless of whether an audio<br>
signal of an upper layer passes through a signal converting<br>
unit and then whether an audio signal of a lower layer<br>
passes through a signal converting unit is indicated.<br>
For the structure of the same upmixing unit, FIG. 6<br>
exemplarily shows that channel configuration information is<br>
represented by the horizontal method and FIG. 7 exemplarily<br>
shows that channel configuration information is represented<br>
25<br><br>
by the vertical method. In FIG. 6 and FIG. 7, a signal<br>
converting unit employs an OTT box for example.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, four audio signals Xi to X4 enter<br>
an upmixing unit. Xi enters a fist signal converting unit<br>
and is then converted to two signals 601 and 603. The<br>
signal converting unit included in the upmixing unit<br>
converts the audio signal using spatial parameters such as<br>
CLD, ICC and the like. The signals 601 and 603 converted by<br>
the first signal converting unit enter a second converting<br>
unit and a third converting unit to be outputted as multi-<br>
channel audio signals Yi to Y4. X2 enters a fourth signal<br>
converting unit and is then outputted as Y5 and Y6. And, X3<br>
and X4 are directly outputted without passing through<br>
signal converting units.<br>
Since Xi passes through the first signal converting<br>
unit, channel configuration information is represented as a<br>
segmenting identifier '1'. Since the channel configuration<br>
information is represented by the horizontal method in FIG.<br>
6, if the channel configuration information is represented<br>
as the segmenting identifier, whether the two signals 601<br>
and 603 outputted via the first signal converting unit pass<br>
through another signal converting units is seguentially<br>
represented as a segmenting or non-segmenting identifier.<br>
The signal 601 of the two output signals of the first<br>
26<br><br>
signal converting unit passes through the second signal<br>
converting unit, thereby being represented as a segmenting<br>
identifier 1. The signal via the second signal converting<br>
unit is outputted intact without passing through another<br>
signal converting unit, thereby being represented as a non-<br>
segmenting identifier 0.<br>
If channel configuration information is "'O' , whether<br>
a next audio signal of a same or upper layer passes through<br>
a signal converting unit is represented as a segmenting or<br>
non-segmenting identifier. So, channel configuration<br>
information is represented for the signal X2 of the upper<br>
layer.<br>
X2, which passes through the fourth signal converting<br>
unit, is represented as a segmenting identifier 1.. Signals<br>
through the fourth signal converting unit are directly<br>
outputted as Y5 and Y6, thereby being represented as non-<br>
segmenting identifiers 0, respectively.<br>
X3 and X4, which are directly outputted without<br>
passing through signal converting units, are represented as<br>
non-segmenting identifiers 0, respectively.<br>
Hence, the channel configuration information is<br>
represented as 110010010000 by the horizontal method. In<br>
this case, the channel configuration information is<br>
extracted through the configuration of the upmixing unit<br>
27<br><br>
for convenience of understanding. Yet, the audio signal<br>
decoding apparatus reads the channel configuration<br>
information to obtain the information for the structure of<br>
the upmixing unit in a reverse way.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, like FIG. 6, four audio signals<br>
Xi to X4 enter an upmixing unit. Since channel<br>
configuration information is represented as a segmenting or<br>
non-segmenting identifier from an upper layer to a lower<br>
layer by the vertical method, identifiers of audio signals<br>
of a first layer 701 as a most upper layer are represented<br>
in sequence. In particular, since Xi and X2 pass though<br>
first and fourth signal converting units, respectively,<br>
each channel configuration information becomes 1. Since X3<br>
and X4 doe not pass through signal converting units, each<br>
channel configuration information becomes 0. So, the<br>
channel configuration information of the first layer 701<br>
becomes 1100. In the same manner, if represented in<br>
sequence, channel configuration information of a second<br>
layer 703 and a third layer 705 become 1100 and 0000,<br>
respectively. Hence, the entire channel configuration<br>
information represented by the vertical method becomes<br>
110011000000.<br>
An audio signal decoding apparatus reads the channel<br>
configuration information and then configures an upmixing<br>
28<br><br>
unit. In order for the audio signal decoding apparatus to<br>
configure the upmixing unit, an identifier indicating that<br>
whether the channel configuration is represented by the<br>
horizontal method or the vertical method should be included<br>
in an audio signal. Alternatively, channel configuration<br>
information is basically represented by the horizontal<br>
method. Yet, if it is efficient to represent channel<br>
configuration information by the vertical method, an audio<br>
signal encoding apparatus may enable an identifier<br>
indicating that channel configuration is represented by the<br>
vertical method to be included in an audio signal.<br>
An audio signal decoding apparatus reads channel<br>
configuration information represented by the horizontal<br>
method and is then able to configure an upmixing unit. Yet,<br>
in case of channel configuration information is represented<br>
by the vertical method, an audio signal decoding apparatus<br>
is able to configure an upmixing unit only if knowing the<br>
number of signal converting units included in the upmixing<br>
unit or the numbers of input and output channels. So, an<br>
audio signal decoding apparatus is able to configure an<br>
upmixing unit in a manner of extracting the number of<br>
signal converting units or the numbers of input and output<br>
channels from the configuration information 109 included in<br>
the spatial information signal 105.<br>
29<br><br>
An audio signal decoding apparatus interprets channel<br>
configuration information in sequence from a front. In case<br>
of detecting the number of segmenting identifiers 1<br>
includes in the channel configuration information as many<br>
as the number of signal converting units extracted from the<br>
configuration information, the audio signal decoding<br>
apparatus needs not to further read the channel<br>
configuration information. This is because the number of<br>
segmenting identifiers 1 included in the channel<br>
configuration information is equal to the number of signal<br>
converting units included in the upmixing unit as the<br>
segmenting identifier 1 indicates that an audio signal is<br>
inputted to the signal converting unit.<br>
In particular, as- mentioned in the forgoing example,<br>
if channel configuration information represented by the<br>
vertical method is 110011000000, an audio signal decoding<br>
apparatus needs to read total 12 bits in order to decode<br>
the channel configuration information. Yet, if the audio<br>
signal decoding apparatus detects that the number of signal<br>
converting units is 4, the audio signal decoding apparatus<br>
decodes the channel configuration information until the<br>
number of Is included in the channel configuration<br>
information appears four times. Namely, the audio signal<br>
decoding apparatus decodes the channel configuration<br>
30<br><br>
information up to 110011 only. This is because the rest of<br>
values are represented as non-segmenting identifiers 0<br>
despite not using the channel configuration information<br>
further. Hence, as it is unnecessary for the audio signal<br>
decoding apparatus to decode six bits, decoding efficiency<br>
can be enhanced.<br>
In case that a channel structure is a preset fixed<br>
channel structure, additional information is unnecessary<br>
since the number of signal converting units or the numbers<br>
of input and output channels" are included in configuration<br>
information that is included in the spatial information<br>
signal 105. Yet, in case that a channel structure is a<br>
random channel structure of which channel structure is not<br>
decided yet, additional information is necessary to<br>
indicate the number of signal converting units or the<br>
numbers of input and output channels since the number of<br>
signal converting units or the numbers of input and output<br>
channels are not included in the spatial information signal<br>
105.<br>
For example of information for a signal converting<br>
unit, in "case of using an OTT box only as a signal<br>
converting unit, information for indicating the signal<br>
converting unit can be represented as maximum 5 bits. In<br>
case that an input signal entering an upmixing unit passes<br>
31<br><br>
through an OTT or TTT box, one input signal is converted to<br>
two signals or two input signals are converted to three<br>
signals. So, the number of output channels becomes a value<br>
resulting from adding the number of OTT or TTT boxes to the<br>
input signal. Hence, the number of the signal converting<br>
unxts becomes a value resulting from subtracting the number<br>
of input signals and the number of TTT boxes from the<br>
number of output channels. Since it is able to use maximum<br>
32 output channels in general, information for indicating<br>
signal converting units can be represented as a value<br>
within five bits.<br>
Accordingly, if channel configuration information is<br>
represented by the vertical method and if a channel<br>
structure is a random channel structure," an audio signal<br>
encoding apparatus separately should represent the number<br>
of signal converting units as maximum five bits in the<br>
spatial information signal 105. In the above example, 6-bit<br>
channel configuration information and 5-bit information for<br>
indicating signal converting units are needed. Namely,<br>
total eleven bits are required. This indicates that a bit<br>
quantity required for configuring an upmixing unit is<br>
reduced rather than the channel configuration information<br>
represented by the horizontal method. Therefore, if channel<br>
configuration information is represented by the vertical<br>
32<br><br>
method, the bit number can be reduced.<br>
FIG. 8 is a block diagram of an audio signal decoding<br>
apparatus according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, an audio signal decoding<br>
apparatus according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention includes a receiving unit, a demultiplexing unit,<br>
a core decoding unit, a spatial information decoding unit,<br>
a signal arranging unit, a multi-channel generating unit<br>
and a speaker mapping unit.<br>
The receiving unit 801 receives an audio signal<br>
including a downmix signal 103 and a spatial information<br>
signal 105.<br>
The demultiplexing unit 803 parses the audio signal<br>
received by the receiving unit 801 into an encoded downmix<br>
signal 103 and an encoded spatial information signal 105<br>
and then sends the encoded downmix signal 103 and the<br>
encoded spatial information signal to the core decoding<br>
unit 805 and the spatial information decoding unit 807,<br>
respectively.<br>
The coder decoding unit 805 and the spatial<br>
information decoding unit 8 07 decode the encoded downmix<br>
signal and the encoded spatial information signal,<br>
respectively.<br>
33<br><br>
As mentioned in the foregoing description, the<br>
spatial information decoding unit 807 decodes the spatial<br>
information signal 105 by extracting a frame identifier, a<br>
timeslot number, a parameter set number, timeslot position<br>
information and the like from the spatial information<br>
signal 105 and by applying a parameter set to a<br>
corresponding timeslot.<br>
The audio signal decoding apparatus is able to<br>
include the signal arranging unit 809. The signal arranging<br>
unit 809 arranges a plurality of downmix signals according<br>
to a preset arrangement to upmix the decoded downmix signal<br>
103. In particular, the signal arranging unit 809 arranges<br>
M downmix signals into M' audio signals in an N-M-N channel<br>
configuration.<br>
The audio signal decoding apparatus directly can<br>
upmix downmix signals according to a sequence that the<br>
downmix signals have passed through the core decoding unit<br>
805. Yet, in some cases, the audio signal decoding<br>
apparatus may perform upmixing after the audio signal<br>
decoding apparatus arranges a sequence of downmix signals.<br>
Under certain circumstances, signal arrangement can<br>
be performed on signals entering a signal converting unit<br>
that upmixes two downmix signals into three signals.<br>
In case of performing signal arrangement on audio<br>
34<br><br>
signals or in case of performing signal arrangement on an<br>
input signal of a TTT box only, signal arrangement<br>
information indicating the corresponding case should be<br>
included in the audio signal by the audio signal encoding<br>
apparatus. IN this case, the signal arrangement information<br>
is an identifier indicating whether signal sequences will<br>
be arranged for upmixing prior to restoring an audio signal<br>
into multi-channel, whether arrangement will be performed<br>
on a specific signal only, or the like.<br>
If a header 107 is included in the spatial<br>
information signal 105, the audio signal decoding apparatus<br>
arranges downmix signals using the audio signal arrangement<br>
information included in configuration information 109<br>
extracted from the header 107.<br>
If a header 107 is not included in the spatial<br>
information signal 105, the audio signal decoding apparatus<br>
is ' able to arrange audio signals using the audio signal<br>
arrangement information extracted from configuration<br>
information 109 included in a previous header 107.<br>
The audio signal decoding apparatus may not perform<br>
the downmix signal arrangement. In particular, the audio<br>
signal decoding apparatus is able to generate multi-channel<br>
by directly upmixing the signal decoded and transferred to<br>
the multi-channel generating unit 811 by the core decoding<br>
35<br><br>
unit 805 instead of performing downmix signal arrangement.<br>
This is because a desired purpose of the signal arrangement<br>
can be achieved by mapping the generated multi -channel to<br>
speakers. In this case, it is able to compress and transfer<br>
an audio signal more efficiently by not inserting<br>
information for. the downmix signal arrangement in the audio<br>
signal. And, complexity of the decoding apparatus can be<br>
reduced by not performing the signal arrangement<br>
additionally.<br>
The signal arranging unit 809 sends the arranged<br>
downmix signal to the multi-channel generating unit 811.<br>
And, the spatial information decoding unit 809 sends the<br>
decoded spatial information signal 105 to the multi-channel<br>
generating unit 811 as well. And, the multi-channel<br>
generating unit 811 generates a multi-channel audio signal<br>
using the downmix signal 103 and the spatial information<br>
signal 105.<br>
The audio signal decoding apparatus includes the<br>
speaker mapping unit 813 to output an audio signal through<br>
the multi-channel generating unit 811 to a speaker.<br>
The speaker mapping unit 813 decides that the multi-<br>
channel audio signal will be outputted by being mapped to<br>
which speaker. And, types of speakers used to output audio<br>
signals in general are shown in Table 1 as follows.<br>
36<br><br>

Generally, maximum 32 speakers are available for<br>
being mapped to an outputted audio signal. So, as shown in<br>
Table 1, the speaker mapping unit 813 enables the audio<br>
signal to be mapped to the speaker (Loudspeaker)<br>
corresponding to each number in a manner of giving a<br>
specific one of numbers (bsOutputCahnnelPos) between 0 and<br>
31 to the multi-channel audio signal. In this case, since<br>
37<br><br>
one of total 32 speakers should be selected to map a first<br>
audio signal among multi-channel audio signals outputted<br>
from the multi-channel generating unit 811 to a speaker, 5<br>
bits are needed. Since one of the remaining 31 speakers<br>
should be selected to map a second audio signal to a<br>
speaker, 5 bits are needed as well. According to this<br>
method, since one of the remaining 16 speakers should be<br>
selected to map a seventeenth audio signal to a speaker, 4<br>
bits are needed. In particular, as the number of mapping<br>
audio signals increases, an information quantity required<br>
for indicating speakers mapped to audio signals decreases.<br>
This can be expressed by ceil [log2 (32-bsOutputChannelPos) ]<br>
representing the bit number required for mapping an audio<br>
-signal to a speaker. The required bit number decreases due<br>
to the increase of the number of audio signals to be<br>
arranged, which can be applicable to the case that the<br>
number of downmix signals arranged by the signal arranging<br>
unit 809 increases. Thus, the audio decoding apparatus maps<br>
the multi-channel audio signal to a speaker and then<br>
outputs the corresponding signal.<br>
While the present invention has been described and<br>
