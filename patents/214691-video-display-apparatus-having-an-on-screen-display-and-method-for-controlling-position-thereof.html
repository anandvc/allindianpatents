				<td>The present invention relates to an apparatus and a method for displaying a representation of adjustment data on a video display of a multi-frequency video display apparatus.<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a video display apparatus and method for use with, for example, a multiscan monitor. Multiscan monitors are designed to operate with input video signals having different horizontal frequencies and are used in color television receivers and computer monitors.<br><br>
Currently there are computer monitors and television receivers which in addition to displaying an input video signal can display various monitor parameters that can be adjusted by displaying characters, numerals, graphics or a combination thereof. This capability to display the parameters to be adjusted is called "on—screen display" (hereinafter "OSD").<br><br>
These video display devices having OSD capability are<br>
N<br><br><br>
designed to allow the user to adjust parameters related to the video display operation. These parameters include the size and center position of the picture screen (raster) displayed upon under—scanning, the rotational distortion and the pincushion distortion of the screen resulting from geomagnetism, convergence, brightness, contrast and other parameters.<br><br>
Such parameters are digitally adjusted by using operation keys used for controlling the adjustment amount of the elements. When these operation keys are used, graphs representing the current adjustments of the parameters are displayed and changed to reflect the new settings on the OSD portion of the display screen, thereby giving the user a visual <br>
feedback of the adjustment status.<br><br>
Fig. 1 of the accompanying drawings is a front view of a monitor illustrating a manner in which the adjustment irformation is typically displayed on the display screen. Operation keys 31a, 31b, 32a, 32b used for controlling an increase and decrease of an adjustment amount are provided at fixed locations on the display apparatus. Further shown in Fig. 1, is an OSD Representation area displayed at a predetermined position of a display screen used to display the current adjustment settings using cursors 35 and 36 on bar graphs 33 and 34, respectively. By operating keys 31a, 31b and 32a, 32b the cursors 35 and 36 are respectively moved left or right corresponding to the adjustment being made, thereby giving the user a visual feedback.<br><br>
The display apparatus of the computer system may receive video signals having various horizontal frequencies. For example, the video signals may have horizontal frequencies ranging from 15.75kHz, which is similar to that of an ordinary television signal, to 31.5Khz or 35kHz used for high—definition display modes, or higher.<br><br>
Since the horizontal linearity characteristics are changed depending on the horizontal frequency, an apparatus capable of receiving video signals having several horizontal frequencies, for example, a multiscan monitor, moves a raster position along the horizontal direction so that the picture is displayed at a position with an optimum horizontal linearity characteristic. Moreover, in order not to change the center position of a picture in response to the movement of the raster,<br>
such apparatMs shifts the position of the picture relative to the raster to the center position thereof again.<br><br>
The representation of the OSD described above is generally formed with reference to the synchronization signal. Therefore1 when the raster position is moved as described above, the display position of the OSD representation is moved to the left or right on the picture screen in response to the change in the synchronization signal. In this case, since the respective OSD representations 33, 34 are displayed to be in alignment with the operation keys 31a, 31b and 32a, 32b, the movement of the raster will throw this alignment of f to the point where the OSD representations 33, 34 may be moved of f the screen, thereby preventing the user from seeing the full OSD representation.<br><br><br>
SU~O(ARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br><br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a multiscan video display apparatus having an on—screen display ("OSD") and a method to prevent the OSD from moving ~on the display screen as the position of a raster is moved, thereby keeping the OSD information aligned with the corresponding operation keys on the display apparatus.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br><br><br><br>
While this invention is susceptible of embodiment in many different forms, there is shown in the drawings and will herein be described in detail specific embodiments, with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an example of the principles of the invention and not intended to limit the invention to the specific embodiments shown and described. In the description below, like reference numerals are used to describe the same, similar or corresponding parts in the several views of the drawing.<br><br>
Turning now to Fig. 2, the present invention is used in a multi-scan monitor, which is a monitor capable of processing and displaying an input video signal having one of several different horizontal frequencies. An input unit 1 includes a plurality of operation keys or a remote controller used for inputting data to the monitor. The input data is supplied from the input unit 1 to a microcomputer 2 for controlling the whole <br>
apparatus.<br><br>
A synchronization signal separating circuit 3 separates synchronization signals from the supplied R, G, B video signals and supplies the R, G, B video signals to a video circuit<br><br>
4. The synchronization signal separating circuit 3 supplies the separated synchronization signals to a deflection synchronization circuit 5 and also to the microcomputer 2.<br><br>
The microcomputer 2 discriminates the horizontal frequency of the supplied synchronization signal and generates, in response to the discriminated horizontal frequency, control data used for moving a raster position and control data used for re—centering the picture position. The microcomputer 2 supplies this control data through the bus lines 6 to the video circuit 4 and the deflection synchronization circuit 5.<br><br>
Thus, the picture obtained from the R, G, B video signals supplied by the video circuit 4 is displayed on a video display unit 7 using as reference the deflection signals supplied from the deflection synchronization circuit 5. In this case, the deflection synchronization circuit 5 operates to move the raster position so that linearity characteristics are optimized in response to the horizontal frequency of the video signal, thereby re—centering the picture position.<br><br>
The display apparatus further includes an on—screen display (OSD) circuit 8 supplied by the ~aicrocomputer 2 through the bus line 6 with the adjustment data by operation of the above mentioned keys. The OSD circuit 8 generates R, G, B signals for the OSD representation of the parameter to be adjusted. The OSD circuit 8 supplies the generated OSD representation signal to the <br>
video circuit 4.<br><br>
The video circuit 4 superimposes the OSD representation signal on the video signal and supplies the processed video s~gnal to the video display unit 7.<br><br>
When the parameter adjustment is increased or decreased by using the operation keys of the input unit 1, the microcomputer 2 controls several of the circuits of the monitor as shown, including the video circuit 4. These circuits then carry out various digital processing operations, for example, the OSD circuit 8 generates a signal representing the parameter under adjustment which signal is then displayed on the video display unit 7, thereby giving the user a visual feedback of the adjustment status.<br><br>
Moreover, the control data used for shifting the position of the OSD in response to the horizontal frequency is supplied to a register (not shown) provided in the OSD circuit 8 by the microcomputer 2 through the bus line 6. The OSD circuit<br><br>
8 corrects the output signals in response to the control data so that the OSD is located at a constant position. Specifically, based on the control data, the OSD circuit 8 controls the timing at which the OSD signal is supplied to the video circuit 4, thereby controlling the display position of the OSD on the display screen of the video display unit 7. The manner in which such timing is controlled will be described in relation to Fig.<br><br>
Turning now to Fig. 3, the method for controlling the position of the OSD will be described. When the process for calculating the horizontal-direction position of the OSD <br>
representation is started in step 1, the synchronization signal is input to the microcomputer 2. Next, the processing proceeds to step 2, where the microcomputer 2 detects the frequency of the horizontal synchronizing signal in the input R, G, B signal. Then, the processing proceeds to step 3, where the microcomputer 2 detects data denoted as Hcent, which is indicative of the raster position corresponding to the detected horizontal frequency. The data indicative of the raster position is, for example, the data Hcent indicative of a center position of the raster. This data corresponding to each of the horizontal frequencies is stored in a register (not shown) of the microcomputer 2.<br><br>
In step 4, the microcomputer 2 calculates a correction amount HCentMax - HCent of the data indicative of the raster position corresponding to the detected frequency of the horizontal synchronization signal. Then in step 5, the microcomputer 2 converts the calculated data into data for transmission to the OSD circuit 8, this conversion is carried out by calculating HPosiSiope x (HCentMax - Hcent). Next, in step 6, the microcomputer 2 adds data HPosi used for determining the position of the OSD representation on the picture screen to the data obtained in step 5. Finally in step 7, the microcomputer 2 transmits the data to the register provided in the OSD circuit<br><br>
8 and the process is ended, thereby displaying the adjustment data on the OSD portion of the display screen of the video display unit 7 at a constant position in response to the detected horizontal frequency.<br><br>
The following Equation (1) is used to calculate the<br><br>
horizontal-direction position of the OSD representation (OSDHPosi). <br><br>
OSDHPosi = HPosiSlope * (HCentMax - HCent) + HPosi<br>
.	. . (1)<br><br><br>
In Equation (1), HCent depicts the data indicating the raster position, and HCentMax depicts a maximum value of the data indicating the raster position. Therefore, it is possible to detect the correction amount of the position of the OSD representation by calculating the difference between these two values.<br><br>
If the difference is multiplied with a coefficient HPosiSlope, then the data indicating the difference is converted into a data unit used for transmitting the data to the OSD circuit 8, this data unit being the data indicating the correction amount to be actually transmitted to the OSD circuit<br><br>
8. This data indicating the correction amount is added with data Hposi (which is set to be an optimum value when HCent=HCentMax) indicating the position of the OSD representation obtained without the correction, whereby it is possible to generate the data to allow the horizontal-direction position of the OSD representation to be displayed at a constant position regardless of the horizontal frequency.<br><br>
According to the present invention, since the position of the OSD representation is corrected in response to the horizontal frequency, it is possible to display the OSD representation at a substantially constant position on the<br><br>
picture screen.<br><br>
Thus, it is apparent that in accordance with the present invention an apparatus and method that fully satisfy the objectives, aims, and advantages is set forth above. While the invention has been described in conjunction with specific embodiments, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications, permutations, and variations will become apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing description.
