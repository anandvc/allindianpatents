				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[002]  The present invention relates to coating medical devices intended for in vivo deployment and, in particular, a method and device suitable for use in an operating theater just prior to implantation, for selectively applying a medical coating to an implantable medical device, for example a stint. DEFINITIONS<br>
[003]  The term "prosthesis" refers to any one of many medical coating applications including but not limited to coronary stents, peripheral vascular stents; abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) devices, biliary stents and catheters, TIPS catheters and stents, vena cava filters, vascular filters and distal support devices and emboli filter / entrapment aids, vascular grafts and stent grafts, gastro enteral tubes/stents, gastra enteral and vascular anastomotic devices, urinary catheters and stents, surgical and wound drainings, radioactive needles and other indwelling metal implants, bronchial tubes and stents, vascular coils, vascular protection devices, tissue and mechanical prosthetic heart valves and rings, arterial-venous shunts, AV access grafts, surgical tampons, dental implants pacemaker-electrodes and leads, suture material, wound healing, tissue closure devices including wires, staplers, surgical clips etc., lUDs and associated pregnancy<br><br>
control devices, ocular implants, timponoplasty implants, hearing aids including cochlear implants, implantable pumps (like insulin pumps), implantable cameras and other diagnostic devices, drug delivery capsules, left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) and other implantable heart support and vascular systems, indwelling vascular access catheters and associated devices (like ports), maxilo fascial implants, orthopedic implants Q'oint replacement, trauma management and spine surgery devices), implantable devices for plastic and cosmetic surgery, implantable meshes (such as for hernia or for uro-vaginal repair, brain disorders, and gastrointestinal ailments).<br>
[004]  The term "drop-on-demand" refers to any active or passive release of a predetermined drop or number of drops equivalent to a desired quantity of coating material. Drop-on-demand also refers to jetting when a sequence of drops is released. One example of "drop-on-demand" is the piezo drop-on-demand technology such as that manufactured by Ink Jet Technology, Inc. of San Jose, California which provides applicators for a wide variety of coating applications. Such micro-machined ceramic designs are robust and chemically inert to almost every kind of fluid and coating and are compatible with a wide range of fluids with extreme pH values or strong solvent characteristics. Non-Newtonian fluids are also compatible with such devices due to the internal design of the applicator allowing laminar flow of the fluid. With a built in heater and high temperature operating potential, piano drop-on-demand applicators Compatible-with- t coating materials.<br><br>
[005]  The term "detector" or "detecting" refers to any device or method which uses energy, such as magnetic, electrical, heat, light, etc. to determine whether a target at a desired location on the prosthesis has been located and signals the applicator to drop-on-demand or marks the location as one to be coated. The detector does not determine the location of the applicator relative to the target to provide feedback for positioning the applicator. The detector determines the points on the coordinate table for desired locations on the prosthesis by providing signals for the applicator controller that are immediately used or stored as coordinate tables. Examples of detectors are light sensitive devices such as CCD area cameras, CCD line cameras, high-resolution CMOS area cameras, or devices that can capture light reflected or transmitted by the prosthesis, and electrically sensitive devices such as capacitance detectors.<br>
[006]  The term "applicator" or "applying" refers to any configuration, apparatus, or method for positioning a coating material to a surface from a reservoir such as a point source including but not limited to a nozzle, a dispenser, or tip, or a multipoint source. An example of an applicator is a drop-on-demand ink-jet.<br>
[007]  The term "on-the-fly" refers to translation and drop-on-demand delivery that is synchronous or close to synchronous, and/or simultaneous or close to simultaneous. Unlike freestyle movement which requires stopping for validation of preceding and^s_ubsej^ujenLmo_V-emenLwitr^ceiatiorj-to-the-prosthesis, on-the-fly continues to next movement without validation step. Figure 13 illustrates an example of on-the-fly drop-on-demand with an<br><br>
embodiment where the axis of rotation 700 is stationery and applicator is moving in the Z axis. A servo controller 705 directs the Z drive 710 which is coupled to applicator 725 while monitoring the velocity and location of the applicator 725 via feedback device 715. The servo controller 705 keeps the Z drive 710 within predetermined limits of the required velocity and signals the applicator controller 720 to activate the drop-on-demand applicator using data from feedback device 715 with reference to coordinates from the pre-scan by a detector determining points to be coated. In this procedure the validation of the Z position of the applicator 725 is done in real-time by the servo controller 705. The servo controller 705 interacts with the axis of rotation to determine the next location based on the last location and the time which it takes Z drive 710 to move applicator 725 to the next location. Feedback device 715 provides feedback that is an internal servo-based logic procedure and is not connected to the actual location relative to the prosthesis and therefore does not become a validation step as discussed above. In alternative embodiments, the servo controller 705, Z drive 710, Z location feedback device 715, the applicator controller 720, and the applicator 725 can be all be bundled into the application control module (not shown).<br>
[008]  The term "freestyle" refers to movement of an applicator over a<br>
portion of a prosthesis to be coated that requires validation through a<br>
predetermined user selected pattern and/or a feedback loop of applicator<br>
-positior^relative_tCLthe-p-ortion^olthe-prosthesis~tcube-coatedr-Validatbn-is<br>
done prior to delivery of the coating material. In one embodiment, freestyle movement moves the applicator over a predetermined position based on a<br><br>
user selected pattern. The position of the applicator is verified relative to the prosthesis and a new location is calculated. The applicator is moved to a new and more accurate location. The applicator delivers the coating material and then moves to the next predetermined location based on the user selected pattern.<br>
[009]  It is noted that, as used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include plural referents unless expressly and unequivocally limited to one referent. Thus for example, reference to "an applicator" includes two or more applicators, but "n is an integer from 1 to 60" means that n is one integer because that is limited to one integer. Also noted that as used herein, the term "polymer" is meant to refer to oligomers, homopolymers, and copolymers. The term "therapeutic agent" is meant to refer to drugs, therapeutic materials, diagnostic materials, inerts, active ingredients, and inactive ingredients.<br>
[010]   For the purposes of this specification and appended claims, unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients or percentages or proportions of other materials, reaction conditions, and so forth used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term "about." Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the following specification and attached claims are approximations that may vary depending upon the<br>
least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at<br><br>
least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques.<br>
[011]   Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however, inherently contains certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements. Moreover, all ranges disclosed herein are to be understood to encompass any and all subranges subsumed therein. For example, a range of "1 to 10" includes any and all subranges between (and including) the minimum value of 1 and the maximum value of 10, that is, any and all subranges having a minimum value of equal to or greater than 1 and a maximum value of equal to or less than 10, e.g., 5.5 to 10. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[012]  The practice of coating implantable medical devices with a synthetic or biological active or inactive agent is known. Numerous processes have been proposed for the application of such a coating. Soaking or dipping the implantable device in a bath of liquid medication is suggested by U.S. Patent 5,922,393 to Jayaraman, soaking in an agitated bath, U.S. Patent 6,129,658 to Delfino et al. Devices introducing heat and/or ultrasonic energy in conjunction with the medicated bath are disclosed in U.S. Patents<br>
6,214,1 Bl to Taylor et al. suggest spraying the .medication by way of pressurized nozzles.<br><br>
[013]   initially such coating were applied at the time of manufacture. For various reasons such as the short shelf life of some drugs combined with the time span from manufacture to implantation and the possible decision of the medical staff involved concerning the specific drug and dosage to be used based on the patient's at the time of implantation, a need has arisen for technologies which permit applying a coating just prior to implantation. Wrapping the implantable device with medicated conformal film is disclosed in U.S. Patent 6,309,380 Bal to Larson et al. Dipping or soaking in a medicated bath just prior to implantation are suggested in U.S. Patents 5,871,436 to Euro, 6,6,454 to Bergerac., and 6,1171,232 Blot Papandreou et al. U.S. Patent 6,3,551 Bal to Wu provides a bathing chamber for use with specific implantable device such as the stint deployed on the balloon of a catheter (Figure 1).<br>
[014]   each of the methods and devices intended for use just prior to implantation, listed above, deposit the coating material onto any and all surfaces that are exposed to the coating. This may result in depositing coating material on surfaces on which the coating is unwanted or undesirable. Further, the coating may crack or break away when the implantable is removed from the implantation apparatus. An example of this would be a stint deployed on a catheter balloon. As the balloon is inflated and the stunt is expanded into position, the coating may crack along the interface between<br>
-The-stenand-the-ballGonThese-eraeks-may-lead-to-a-breakin§-away-of-a<br>
portion of the coating from the stunt itself. Similar problems can occur in cases where the coating technique fails to prevent inadvertent overlapping<br><br>
With the edges (e.g., internal surfaces along the edges) of various devices (e.g., struts of stunts). This, in turn, may affect the medicinal effectiveness of the coating, and negatively affect the entire medical procedure.<br>
[015]   It is known to use Ink-Jet technology to apply a liquid to selected portion of a surface. In the paper "Applications of Ink-Jet Printing Technology to Biomes and Micro fluidic Systems," presented at the SPIC Conference on Micro fluidics and Biomes, October, 01, the authors, Patrick Cooley, David Wallace, and Began Another provide a fairly detailed description of Ink-Jet technology and the range of its medically related applications (http://www.microfab.compapers/papers_pdf/spie biomems_O1_reprint.pdf).<br>
[016] a related device is disclosed in U.S. Patent 6,001,311 to Brennan, which uses a moveable two-dimensional array of nozzles to deposit a plurality of different liquid reagents into receiving chambers. In the presentation of Cooley and the device of Brennan, the selective application of the material is based on an objective predetermined location of deposit rather that on a "subjective placement" as needed to meet the requirements of a specific application procedure. With regard to the application of coatings applied to medical devices with inkjet applicators, while it is possible to coat only a chosen portion of a device, such as only the stint mounted on a catheter, but not the catheter itself. This type of procedure using current technologies may, however, require providing complex data files, such as a<br><br>
Installed in the coating apparatus in a precise manner so as to be oriented exactly the same as the CAD image.<br><br>
[017]  Other systems which use ink-jet applicators apply the coating with a "freestyle" procedure. The freestyle points are determined by a preprogrammed user selected pattern that is unique to the particular shape or contour for the type of prosthesis and the desired coating to be achieved, much like a vector based printing approach. The ink-jet nozzle or prosthesis move in three-dimensionally with the aid of a motion control system. The motion control system enables the ink-jet nozzle to move over the portions of the prosthesis to be sprayed. Alternatively, a real-time picture can be taken with a camera to determine the position of the ink-jet nozzle in relation to the prosthesis. Based upon the feedback of nozzle location, the ink-jet applicator can be controlled by activating the spray, moving the ink-jet nozzle, and/or moving the prosthesis to adjust to the pattern to better conform with the actual prosthesis.<br>
[018]  This type of system is particularly inefficient because the preprogrammed user selected pattern fails to accommodate inherent variability in the surface of the prosthesis. In one non-limiting embodiment, for example, a stint crimped around a balloon catheter will not be crimped such that it has the same surface each time. The crimping cannot be determined from the factory according to the manufacturer's specifications of the stint. Further, using this type of feedback loop serves merely as a "first impression" to control the spraying, nozzle position, and/or prosthesis<br>
apply the coating. In the operational theatre, this is undesired because many types of coatings (e.g., palliate, repaying, or several other pharmaceutical<br><br>
Compounds or bioactive agents) have to be applied to the stint crimped on the balloon catheter immediately prior to surgery.<br>
[019] the significance of delivering drug-loaded prostheses may offer savings benefit in time and cost. Studies have been conducted to show the importance of delivering the correct drug dose density on coronary stints to prevent rest enosis by application of palliate or repaying.

Other studies have shown how accuracy of dose related to cytotoxicity of coating drugs. Lineman, J.E .et al., Catatonic Studies Of Palliate (Taxi) In Human Tumor Cell Lines, Br. J.

[020] There is therefore a need for a device, and method for its use, whereby a coating is selectively applied to an implantable medical device just prior to implantation, such that only the device or selected portions thereof are coated. It would be desirable for the device to provide for user selection of coating material and dosage to be applied, thereby providing choices as to the specific coating material and dosage to be applied based on the specific needs of the patient at the time of implantation. It would be further desirable for the device to provide a sterile environment in which the coating is applied and the device is suitable for use in an operating theater.<br>
[021]  Finally, a method and apparatus for coating a prosthesis is desired that will reduce the time of coating by coating the prosthesis "on the fly" without having to stop at each point to apply the coating. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0156] The present invention is a method and device, which is suitable for use in an operating theater just prior to implantation, for selectively applying a medical coating to an implantable medical device, for example a stint.<br>
[01 57] The principles and operation of a coating device according to the present invention may be better understood with reference to the drawings and the accompanying description.<br>
[0158] By way of introduction, the embodiment discussed herein is a<br>
coating being applied just prior to implantation and if desired in the operating theater. The use of optical scanning devices enables a processing unit to<br>
distinguish between the surface area of the stint and the surface area of the catheter. The processing unit selectively activates the coating applicator so as to apply the coating to substantially only the stint and not the balloon or other portion of the catheter. The coating applicator discussed herein is, by non-limiting example, a pressure-pulse actuated drop-ejection system with at least one nozzle. A readily available pressure-pulse actuated drop-ejection system, which is well suited for the present invention, is a drop-on-demand inkjet system. It should be noted, however, that any coating application system that may be selectively activated is within the intentions of the present invention. While the discussion herein is specific to this embodiment, which is intended for use in an operating theater, among other places, this embodiment it is intended as a non-limiting example of the principals of the present invention. It will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art, the range of applications suited to the principals of the present invention. Even the device described herein, as a non-limiting example, with minor adaptations to the object-holding element and choice of fluid coating materials, is well suited for a wide range of objects to which a coating is applied.<br>
[0159] Referring now to the drawings, as mentioned above, Figures 1<br>
illustrates a device for applying a coating to a stint 2 that is deployed on a<br>
catheter 4. The coating being applied may be a synthetic or biological, active<br>
or inactive agent. The perspective view of Figure 2 is of the same side of the<br>
device will be better understood, Figure 2 will be referenced. The catheter 4 is placed in an application compartment 40 and held in position by a relatable<br>
catheter-holding base 6 and a Rota table upper catheter-holding element 8, which are configured for substantially continued rotation, that is they may complete a plurality of full 360 degree rotations, as required, during the coating process. The actual rotation may be substantially fully continuous (non-stop) or intermittent. The upper catheter-holding element will be discussed in detail below with regard to Figure 4. The enclosed application compartment provides a sterile environment in which the coating process is performed. The rotation of the catheter-holding base and the upper catheter-holding element is actuated and synchronized by a motor and gear system that includes gear clusters 12, 14, 16, and shaft 18 (see also Figure 2). Alternatively, the gears may be replaced by drive belts or drive chains. The remaining length of the catheter is supported by a support antenna 22, as illustrated, by non-limiting example, in Figure 6. As noted above, the object-holding elements may be modified so as to hold any object suitable for coating according to the teachings of the present invention.<br>
[01 60] The coating is applied by a drop-on-demand inkjet system in association with an optical scanning device and processing unit. As the object is rotated by the object-holding element, the optical scanning device scans the surface of the object. The out-put from the scanning device is used by the processing unit to determine if the surface area currently aligned with the coating applicator is of the type of surface to be coated. When it is<br>
applicator, the processing unit activates the coating applicator and the coating is dispensed. The embodiment shown here includes three inkjet coating<br>
applicators 30a, 30b, and 30c, and two optical scanning devices 32a and 32b. The optical scanning devices may be configured to generate digital output or an analog signal, which is in turn analyzed by the processing unit. It should be noted that the number of coating applicators and scanning devices may be varied to meet design or application requirements. The three coating applicators and the two optical scanning devices are mounted on a displaceable applicator head 34. The position of the applicator head within the application compartment, and thereby the spatial relationship between the coating applicator and the stunt, or other object being coated, is regulated by the application control module 36, which is, in turn, controlled by the processing unit. The change of position of the applicator head is effected vertically by turning the vertical positioning screw 60 in conjunction with guide shaft 62, and the horizontally by turning the horizontal positioning screw 64 in conjunction with guide shaft 66. The vertical repositioning in conjunction with the rotation of the object enables the coating applicator to traverse substantially the entire surface of the object requiring coating.<br>
[0161] Fluid coating material is stored in three fluid reservoirs 50a, 50b, and 50c (see Figure 2), and supplied to the respective coating applicators by the fluid supply hoses 52a, 52b and 52c (see Figure 2). In general use, each of the fluid reservoirs contains a different coating material, thus, each coating applicator will deposit a different coating material on the stint or other objected being coated, as required Further, a plurality of coats may be applied, each coat being of a different coating material and, if required, of a different thickness. Thus, at the time of coating, a single appropriate coating<br>
material may be chosen from the materials provides, or a combination of coatings may be chosen. It should be noted that while the fluid reservoirs are shown here in a compartment inside the device housing, this need not always be the case, and the reservoirs may be external to the housing.<br>
[0162] It should be noted that, alternatively, the inkjet system may be deployed in a disposable housing that also includes a fluid reservoir filled with coating material. The fluid reservoir may be an enclosed volume that is integral to the disposable housing or it may be a coating filled cartridge that is inserted into a receiving cavity in the disposable housing. In this case, as illustrated in Figure 3, the displaceable applicator head 34 is configured so as to accept one or more of the disposable housings 36a, 36b, and 36c, which in turn house inkjet coating applicators 38a, 38b, and 38e respectively. The fluid reservoirs (not shown) for each applicator are housed in that portion of the disposable housing that is deployed within the displaceable applicator head 34.<br>
[0163] Figure 4 illustrates how the base housing section 70 and the detachable housing section 72 are interconnected. The two sections are held together by inserting pins 74, extending from the detachable housing section, into the corresponding holes 76, located in the base housing section, and engaging the latch mechanism 78 with the catch element 80. Detachment of the two sections is accomplished by pressing the release "button" 84, which<br>
sections are then pulled apart. As seen here more clearly, the application compartment is defined by a top, floor and three walls located in the<br><br>
detachable housing section and one wall on the base housing section. The detachable housing section is configured so as to be disposable, or if desired, easily cleaned and re-sterilized.<br>
[0164] The detail of Figure 5 shows the components of the upper catheter-holding element. Extending from substantially the center of the rotating base plate 90, is a threaded tube 92. This tube is the external end of the passageway through which the catheter tip with the stint attached is inserted in order to deploy the stint in the application compartment of the coating device. The tube is cut longitudinally several times, to create threaded sections 98, here six, that are configured so as to flex outward from the center. The tightening-disk 94, has a correspondingly threaded center hole for deployment on the tube 92 such that when the tightening-disk is brought to a position proximal to the base plate, the threaded sections near the end of the tube will flex outwardly thereby enlarging the diameter of the opening. The gripping element 96 also has divergently flexing "fingers" 100. In operation, the gripping element is deployed around the catheter, which is then passed through the tube and into the application compartment. Once the catheter is positioned on the catheter holding base, the gripping element is at least partially inserted into the opening of the tube. The tightening-disk 94 is then rotated about the tube, and thereby brought to a position proximal to the end of the tube, the outwardly flexing sections of the tube 98 are brought into an un- the diameter of the tube opening pushes the "fingers" of the gripping element against the catheter, thereby holding the catheter in place.<br>
[0165] A non-limiting example of the stint coating process as accomplished by the above describe device would be as follows:<br>
[0166] 1.       The fluid reservoirs are filled with the required fluid coating materials.<br>
[0167] 2.       The parameters of the coating are inputted into the processing unit. The parameters may include, by non-limiting example, the coating material to be applied, the thickness of the coating, number of multiple layers of different coating material, the order in which the layered materials are to be applied, and the thickness of each layer. The parameters may be determined by the physician at the time the coating is applied or the parameters may be pre-set, such as those determined by medical regulations. In the case of pre-set parameters, the physician would simply input a "start" command.<br>
[0168] 3.       The catheter is positioned in the application compartment and the upper catheter-holding element is tightened.<br>
[0169] 4.       As the catheter rotates, the optical scanning device scans the surface of the catheter, to distinguish between the surface of the balloon and the surface of the stint.<br>
[0170] 5.       When a portion of the surface of the stint is detected and determined to be in alignment with the appropriate coating applicator, the processing unit selectively activates the applicator, thereby ejecting the<br>
~rrecessary-amounto^oating-materralrwhich-is-deposited-substarttially-only	<br>
on the surface of the stint <br>
[0171]6.       Throughout the coating process, the position of the applicator head is adjusted as required. This adjustment may bring the coating applicator closer to, or farther away from, the surface of the stint, and it may adjust the vertical deployment of the coating applicator, thereby allowing different areas of the surface of the stint to be coated. Further, if a different fluid coating material is needed for a different layer of the coating, the coating applicator for that particular coating material may be brought into appropriate alignment for deposition of the new coating material on the stint. [0172] 7.       When the coating process is completed, the catheter with the now coated stint is removed from the device, and the stint is ready for implantation.<br>
[0173] 8.       The detachable housing section is removed and may be cleaned and sterilized for re-use, or simply discarded.<br>
[0174] It should be noted that in some cases it may be desirable to coat substantially the entire surface of the object being coated. This may be accomplish in at least two ways. The object itself may have only one type of surface. Alternatively, the scanning device may be configured so as to provide adjustable scanning sensitivity. In such a case, the sensitivity of the scanning device may be adjusted such that the out-put is indicative of only one type of surface and the processing unit is unable to distinguish between different types of surfaces.<br>
-[04-7§]-The-flowGhanVofFigure-7A-illustrates-a-proGess-for-Goatinprosthesis 102 based on the present invention. In this non-limiting example, the prosthesis is a stint that is to be coated with a therapeutic agent. The<br>
first step 105 is to place the stint and therapeutic agent container in the steno coating device. The system is then ready for processing the stint. The system starts at 110. The pre-coating procedure 115 collects information in the processing unit (not shown) of the stint coating device to be used during the coating procedure 120. The post-coating procedure 125 verifies that the stint has been properly coated and should be approved for removal 130. The flowchart of Figure 7B illustrates the process for coating stints 140 known in the art. The user selects a pattern 145 according to the type of stint to be coated and the pattern of coating to be delivered. The pattern selected varies on parameters provided by the stint manufacturer and the coating to be applied. The process starts 150 according to the pattern that has been selected. The coating procedure 155 applied the coating to the stint, and once complete, the coated stunt 160 is ready for removal.<br>
[0176] Figure 8 illustrates the pre-scanning procedure 115. The stint is pre-scanned 205 prior to the coating procedure 120. In parallel, the application control module is initialized 200. Initialization of the application control module comprises finding a specific point on the stint to begin coating. The pre-scan is analyzed 210 in the processing unit. The analysis determines and compiles the coating coordinates table 215 to be used to position the application control module.<br>
[0177] There is a large standard deviation between stints of the same<br>
-desigrvespecially-aftei^the-stent-is-crimped-on-the-balloon-eatheter-r—The-<br>
preprogrammed pattern is not helpful to manage these deviations from the design. Pre-scanning can provide a check for defects in the stint structure<br><br>
prior to coating. Pre-scanning can also provide the best positions on to which to spray the coating. Crimping does not always result in a uniform deformation of the stint structure. Some portions of the stint may be more densely packed than other portions. Some intersections of stunt struts may have different angles of incidence. Pre-scanning can provide the optimal path to follow over the stint surface to be coated. Some applications require only a portion of the stint to be coated. Pre-scanning can prevent over-jetting of the coating on a specific location. Over-jetting can result in inadvertent coating from the stint on the balloon catheter.<br>
[0178] Scanning can be achieved by a variety of imaging techniques known in the art of imaging, including but not limited to photographic, video, infrared, and VCSEL (Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser) technologies using a variety of detectors. Vessels can be used as the detector for optical imaging, and can double as the applicator itself. Coquette, Kent D., Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers- Light for Information Age, MRS Bulletin, pp. 507-511, July 2002. In one non-limiting embodiment, a photograph of the stint is taken by a detector. The stunt is rotated slightly (e.g., one-half to a few degrees) and then another photograph is taken, resulting in at least several dozen photographs total. The detector is focused sufficiently close to the stint to record enough resolution relative to the coating droplet to be applied. If the stint is long, the rotation may have to be repeated to capture -the-top-and-bottom-of-the-stint,—<br>
[0179] A light source can be positioned on the same side as the detector or on the opposite side of the detector relative to the stint. In the<br><br>
embodiment where the light source is on the same side as the detector, the detector received light reflected by the stint. The stint appears light in color and the balloon appears dark in color. In the embodiment where the light source is on the opposite side of the detector, the detector receives light transmitted through the balloon and around the stint struts. The stint appears dark in color and the balloon appears light in color. The contrast between the light and dark color in both embodiments can be used for edge analysis. Edge analysis comprises determining the edges of the stint and finding the center-line of stint surface to be coated. The edges and center-line determine the coating coordinates which are collected for each surface of the stint to be coated in the coating coordinates table.<br>
[0180] In one non-limiting embodiment, the pre-scan is compared to an index of patterns in the processing unit. This can be used to confirm the accuracy of the edge analysis and provide a safety measure for detection of defects in the stint or errors in the edge analysis.<br>
[0181] Coating coordinates can be interpreted and coded as raster or vector type of data forms. These data forms describe different translation of the applicator by the Z driver. Both data forms comprise using an algorithm to find all the coordinates of the stint that should be coated and compiling a map of "to be coated points" or coordinates. Chart 1 illustrates a map of coordinates showing the point location on Z, as a function of the relative axial<br>
 [0183] Vector type coating comprises taking the unique variables (e.g., Z and rotation), and using another algorithm to select the shortest distance or otherwise most efficient path to move between one coating coordinate and the next most proximate coordinate to be coated. Vector coating can also comprise creating a list of coordinates in sequential order. Table 1 illustrates a "best pass algorithm" as a coordinate table correlating location on Z to angle of rotation for each coordinate. Table 1<br><br>
(Table Removed)  [0184] Control software in the processing unit can calculate a set of movement vectors for the application control module between each set of sequential coordinates. Vector parameters may comprise coordinates, Az (change in location between two adjacent points or coordinates on Z axis), Argot (change in angle between coordinates), velocity between the coordinates, etc. Table 2 illustrates vectors that can be calculated from coordinate table in Table 1. Each vector can have a different velocity associated with it represented as values a, b, and c. Each vector can have a difference quantity associated with it represented as values d, e, f, g, h which may be the same or different. Other parameters can also be associated with each vector.<br>
(Table Removed)[0185] A raster type coating comprises using an algorithm to find all the coordinates of the stent that should be coated and compiling a map of coordinates. This is similar to vector type coating as is illustrated in Chart 1 above. Raster type coating, however, also comprises taking the unique variables (e.g., Z and rotation), and using a different algorithm to calculate and compile a coordinate table of Z coordinates for each rotation angle in predetermined increments of rotation. The term "rotation resolution" refers to the number of increments in rotation angle. Raster type coating is rotation-resolution-specific. This means that raster printing is calculated and executed at one specific rotation resolution, or in a variety of other manipulations interrelating the prosthetic item to be coated, the holder for such prosthetic and the applicator nozzle. Table 3 illustrates a coordinate table correlating angle of rotation with locations on Z. These locations: Z1, Z2, Z3, Z4, etc. represent intersections with the surface of the stent to be coated at each angle of rotation.<br>
(Table Removed)[0186] Control software in the processing unit can calculate the Z coordinates for each angular position and direct the application control module and coating applicator to go to an angular rotation position and move along Z at a regulated, constant or variable velocity. While moving along Z,<br>
the coating applicator injects at Z1, 22, Z3, Z4, etc. After traveling the full length of the stent along Z, the application control module moves the coating applicator to the next angle of rotation, changes the direction along Z (now opposite the previous direction) which the coating applicator travels. While traveling in this new direction, the coating applicator injects over the next Z locations.<br>
[0187] Additional raster-based manipulations could include, for example, rotational movements of the stent in conjunction with serial, stepped Z -axis movements, or "screw-like" movements along a helical path of the stent accomplished by simultaneous movement of rotation and stepped Z-axis movements as is described below. In any event, the raster-based coating process results in motion with respect to the stent and applicator which covers the entire prosthetic, while the vector-based coating process only travels over the "to be coated" surfaces. Consequently, the vector-based approach is object dependent, while the raster-based approach is simply system defined.<br>
[0188] Figure 11 illustrates a stent 2 on a balloon catheter 4. The axis of rotation, Z, is also the axis of symmetry 500 for the stent. The magnified window of Figure 11 shows the stent structure to be coated 505 and gaps in stent structure where balloon catheter 4 is not covered by the stent. During scanning, the stent is rotated in incremental angles according to the rotation<br>
resolution to generate the coordinate table.  During coating, the application	<br>
control module rotates the stent in the same incremental angles and positions the coating applicator at the Z locations to coat the stent. In one non-limiting<br>
embodiment, the coating applicator can drop-on-demand a coating with accuracy as is known in the art of ink-jet printing.<br>
[0189] The flowchart of Figure 9A illustrates an embodiment of the<br>
coating procedure 120. The present embodiment contemplates raster<br>
coating accomplished by longitudinal movement of the applicator along the<br>
length of a cylindrical body and point-to-point ("PTP") rotation of the cylindrical<br>
body or applicator around the circumference of the cylindrical body. An initial<br>
angle of rotation is selected 300. The application control module moves the<br>
coating along the Z axis 310, while controlling drop-on-demand at Z<br>
coordinate 315, and receiving the next coating coordinate from the processing<br>
unit 305. Once the coating applicator has moved along the length of the<br>
stent, the application control module changes the direction of travel along the<br>
Z axis of the coating applicator 320, and rotates the stent to the next angle of<br>
rotation 325. This process is repeated by repeating steps 310-325 until the<br>
stent has been coated according to the coordinate table. In one non-limiting<br>
embodiment, the change in incremental angle of rotation can be one-half of<br>
one degree and can require up to 500 rotations of the stent to coat each point<br>
in the coordinate table. Multiple coatings can be applied sequentially or<br>
simultaneously by repeating the steps and/or changing the coating reservoir.<br>
[0190] In another embodiment, raster coating can be accomplished by<br>
coating along the circumferential rotation of the cylindrical body or applicator<br>
_with-RT^Iongitudinal-movemervt-of-the-appliGator-along-the-length-of-the	<br>
cylindrical body. In another embodiment, raster coating can be accomplished by both circumferential rotation of the cylindrical body or applicator and<br><br>
longitudinal movement of the applicator with PTP longitudinal movement of the applicator or PTP rotation of the cylindrical body or applicator along the circumference of the cylindrical body. This embodiment results in a spiral or "screw" predetermined path.<br>
[0191] In other embodiments, raster coating can be accomplished by following a predetermined path to apply coating material at desired locations of the prosthesis without regard to the pattern of the coating. In some embodiments, this predetermined path can incorporate the overall contour or geometrical shape of the prosthesis to efficiently cover the surface area which includes the desired locations to be coated. In some certain embodiments, efficiency can be realized by utilizing axes of symmetry or other geometrical simplifications of the overall contour of the prosthesis.<br>
[0192] The flowchart of Figure 9B illustrates the coating procedure 155 which is known in the art. The coating nozzle is in an initial position 330. The controller receives coordinates from a user selected pattern 335. The controller interprets the coordinates into X, Y, and Z constant velocity movement 340, and positions the nozzle to jet by controlling the nozzle delivery 350, the nozzle motion 355, and/or the stent motion 360. The nozzle then drop-on-demand 365. Then the nozzle travels over the stent to the next coordinate based on the user selected patter.<br>
[0193] The flowchart of Figure 9C illustrates the coating procedure 155<br>
which is known in the art also begins with the coating nozzle at an initial	<br>
position 330. A picture of the nozzle, stent, and/or coating is taken 342. The picture is analyzed using vision software 345.   The controller interprets the<br><br>
picture and positions the nozzle to jet by controlling the nozzle delivery 350, the nozzle motion 355, and/or the stent motion 360. The nozzle then drop-on-demand 365. This requires real-time imaging and adjustment prior to coating portions of the stent.<br>
[0194] The flowchart in Figure 10 illustrates an embodiment of the present invention including a post-coating procedure 125. The coating applicator is held in stand-by mode 400, while the stent is post-scanned 405, scan analysis 410 analyzes the coated stent for mistakes in coating and provides coating quality assurance and approval 420. If approved, the stent coating is complete 130. In one non-limiting embodiment, the coating comprises pigment to facilitate scan analysis by differentiating between the stent and coating. In one non-limiting embodiment, the pre-scan images can be used for the approval of the stent. Post-scanning facilitates locating coordinates where coating was not applied because of jetting problems. Post-scanning also facilitates in locating leakage or "overspray" points where the coating has leaked from the stent onto the balloon catheter.<br>
[0195] The flow chart in Figure 12 illustrates an embodiment of raster coating without pre-scanning or post-scanning. The method for coating a prosthesis 600, begins with setting 605 the predetermined length L, incremental linear movement Ax, and incremental angular movement A0, along with a reference point recognized as a characteristic feature of the _p_r_o.striesis__Trie_detactotiis-turned on_610^The-detector-and-applicator-move-615 linearly from the reference point an incremental distance Ax and A9 along L. The detector looks for targets 620 as desired locations on the prosthesis<br><br>
to be coated. If the detector finds a target, the applicator drop-on-demand 625. If the detector does not find a target or after the applicator drop-on-demand 625, the detector and applicator move Ax 630. The detector determines whether it has traveled the full L of the prosthesis 635 by determining whether the sum of the Ax movements is greater than or equal to L (D Ax  L). If the detector has not traveled the full L, then the detector and applicator move Ax 640 and look for a target 620. If the detector has traveled the full L, then the detector and applicator move A0 645. The detector determined whether it has traveled around the entire contour of the prosthesis 650 by determining whether the sum of the A0 movements is greater than or equal to 360 degrees<br>
(Z A0 &gt; 360°). If the detector has not traveled 360 degrees, then the detector and applicator move 615 linearly an incremental distance Ax and A0 along L. If the detector has traveled 360 degrees, then the coating is finished 655.<br>
