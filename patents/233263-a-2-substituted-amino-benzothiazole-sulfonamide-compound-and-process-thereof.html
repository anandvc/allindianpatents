				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The   present  invention  relates   to  a  2-(substituted-amino)-benzothiazole sulfonamide compound and process thereof.<br>
The present invention relates to 2-(substituted-amino)-benzothiazole sulfonamides, men-use as aspartic protease inhibitors, in particular as broadspectrum HIV protease inhibitors, processes for their preparation as well as pharmaceutical compositions and diagnostic kits comprising them. The present invention also concerns combinations of the present 2-(substituted-amino)-benzothiazole sulfonamides with another anti-retroviral agent. It farther relates to their use in assays as reference compounds or as reagents.<br>
The virus causing the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is known by different names, including T-lymphocyte virus III (HTLV-III) or lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV) or AIDS-related virus (ARV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Up until now, two distinct families have been identified, i.e. HIV-1 and HIV-2. Hereinafter, HIV will be used to generically denote these viruses.<br>
One of the critical pathways in a retroviral life cycle is the processing of polyprotein precursors by aspartic protease. For instance with the HIV virus the gag-pol protein is processed by HIV protease. The correct processing of the precursor polyproteins by the aspartic protease is required for the assembly of infectious virions, thus making the aspartic protease an attractive target for antiviral therapy. In particular for HIV treatment, the HIV protease is an attractive target.<br>
HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) are commonly administered to AIDS patients in combination with other anti-HIV compounds such as, for instance nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) or other protease inhibitors. Despite the fact that these antiretrovirals are very useful, they have a common limitation, namely, the targeted enzymes in the HIV virus are able to mutate in such a way that the known drugs become less effective, or even ineffective against these mutant HIV viruses. Or, in other words, the HIV virus creates an ever increasing resistance against the available drugs.<br>
Resistance of retroviruses, and in particular the HIV virus, against inhibitors is a major cause of therapy failure. For instance, half of the patients receiving anti-HIV combination therapy do not respond fully to the treatment, mainly because of resistance of the virus to one or more drugs used. Moreover, it has been shown that resistant virus is carried over to newly infected individuals, resulting in severely limited therapy options for these drug-naive patients.   Therefore, there is a need in the art for new<br><br>
CONFIRMATION COPY<br>
compounds for retrovirus therapy, more particularly for AIDS therapy. The need in the<br>
art is particularly acute for compounds that are active not only on wild type HIV virus,<br>
but also on the increasingly more common resistant HIV viruses.<br>
Known antiretrovirals, often administered in a combination therapy regimen, will<br>
eventually cause resistance as stated above. This often may force the physician to<br>
boost the plasma levels of the active drugs in order for said antiretrovirals to regain<br>
effectivity against the mutated HIV viruses. The consequence of which is a highly<br>
undesirable increase in pill burden. Boosting plasma levels may also lead to an<br>
increased risk of non-compliance with the prescribed therapy. Thus, it is not only<br>
important to have compounds showing activity for a wide range of HIV mutants, it is<br>
also important that there is little or no variance in the ratio between activity against<br>
mutant HIV virus and activity against wild type HIV virus (also defined as fold<br>
resistance or FR) over a broad range of mutant HIV strains. As such, a patient may<br>
remain on the same combination therapy regimen for a longer period of time since the<br>
chance that a mutant HIV virus will be sensitive to the active ingredients will be<br>
increased.<br>
Finding compounds with a high potency on the wild type and on a wide variety of<br>
mutants is also of importance since the pill burden can be reduced if therapeutic levels<br>
are kept to a minimum. One way of reducing this pill burden is finding anti-HIV<br>
compounds with good bioavailability, i.e. a favorable pharmacokinetic and metabolic<br>
profile, such that the daily dose can be minimized and consequently also the number of<br>
pills to be taken.<br>
Another important characteristic of a good anti-HIV compound is that plasma protein<br>
binding of the inhibitor has minimal or even no effect on its potency.<br>
Thus, there is a high medical need for protease inhibitors that are able to combat a<br>
broad spectrum of mutants of the HIV virus with little variance in fold resistance, have<br>
a good bioavailability and experience little or no effect on then: potency due to plasma<br>
protein binding.<br>
Up until now, several protease inhibitors are on the market or are being developed.<br>
One particular core structure (depicted below) has been disclosed in a number of<br>
references, such as, WO 95/06030, WO 96/22287, WO 96/28418, WO 96/28463,<br>
WO 96/28464, WO 96/28465 and WO 97/18205. The compounds disclosed therein are<br>
described as retroviral protease inhibitors.<br>
WO 99/67254 discloses 4-substituted-phenyl sulfonamides capable of inhibiting multidrug<br>
resistant retroviral proteases.<br>
Surprisingly, the 2-(substituted-amino)-benzothiazole sulfonamides of the present<br>
invention are found to have a favorable pharmacological and pharmacokinetic profile.<br>
Not only are they active against wild-type HIV virus, but they also show a<br>
broadspectrum activity against various mutant HIV viruses exhibiting resistance against<br>
known protease inhibitors.<br>
Though some of the present 2-(substituted-amino)-benzothiazole sulfonamides appear<br>
to fall within the generic description of some of the above cited patent publications,<br>
they are not specifically disclosed, suggested or claimed therein, nor would a person<br>
skilled in the art have been motivated to design them as broadspectrum protease<br>
inhibitors.<br>

The term "prodrug" as used throughout this text means the pharmacologically<br>
acceptable derivatives such as esters, amides and phosphates, such that the resulting in<br>
vivo biotransformation product of the derivative is the active drug as defined in the<br>
compounds of formula (I). The reference by Goodman and Oilman (The<br>
Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 8th ed, McGraw-Hill, Int. Ed. 1992,<br>
"Biotransformation of Drugs", p 13-15) describing prodrugs generally is hereby<br>
incorporated. Prodrugs of a compound of the present invention are prepared by<br>
modifying functional groups present in the compound in such a way that the<br>
modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent<br>
compound. Prodrugs include compounds of the present invention wherein a hydroxy<br>
group, for instance the hydroxy group on the asymmetric carbon atom, or an amino<br>
group is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug is administered to a patient,<br>
cleaves to form a free hydroxyl or free amino, respectively.<br>
Typical examples of prodrugs are described for instance in WO 99/33795,<br>
WO 99/33815, WO 99/33793 and WO 99/33792 all incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Prodrugs are characterized by excellent aqueous solubility, increased bioavailability<br>
and are readily metabolized into the active inhibitors in vivo.<br>
For therapeutic use, the salts of the compounds of formula (I) are those wherein the<br>
counterion is pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable. However, salts having a<br>
pharmaceutically unacceptable counterion may also find use, for example, in the<br>
preparation or purification of a pharmaceutically acceptable compound of formula (I).<br>
All salts, whether pharmaceutically acceptable or not are included within the ambit of<br>
the present invention.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable or physiologically tolerable addition salt forms which<br>
the compounds of the present invention are able to form can conveniently be prepared<br>
using the appropriate acids, such as, for example, inorganic acids such as hydrohalic<br>
acids, e.g. hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid; sulfuric; nitric; phosphoric and the like<br>
acids; or organic acids such as, for example, acetic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic, lactic,<br>
pyruvic, oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, malic, tartaric, citric, methanesulfonic,<br>
ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, j&gt;-toluenesulfonic, cyclamic, salicylic,<br>
p-amino-salicylic, pamoic and the like acids.<br>
Conversely said acid addition salt forms can be converted by treatment with an<br>
appropriate base into the free base form.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) containing an acidic proton may also be converted into<br>
their non-toxic metal or amine addition salt form by treatment with appropriate organic<br>
and inorganic bases. Appropriate .base salt forms comprise, for example, the<br>
ammonium salts, the alkali and earth alkaline metal salts, e.g. the lithium, sodium,<br>
potassium, magnesium, calcium salts and the like, salts with organic bases, e.g. the<br>
benzathine, N-methyl, -D-glucamine, hydrabamine salts, and salts with amino acids<br>
such as, for example, arginine, lysine and the like.<br>
Conversely said base addition salt forms can be converted by treatment with an<br>
appropriate acid into the free acid form.<br>
The term "salts" also comprises the hydrates and the solvent addition forms which the<br>
compounds of the present invention are able to form. Examples of such forms are e.g.<br>
hydrates, alcoholates and the like.<br>
The A^-oxide forms of the present compounds are meant to comprise the compounds of<br>
formula (I) wherein one or several nitrogen atoms are oxidized to the so-called TV-oxide.<br>
The present compounds may also exist in their tautomeric forms. Such forms, although<br>
not explicitly indicated in the above formula are intended to be included within the<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
The term stereochemically isomeric forms of compounds of the present invention, as<br>
used hereinbefore, defines all possible compounds made up of the same atoms bonded<br>
by the same sequence of bonds but having different three-dimensional structures which<br>
are not interchangeable, which the compounds of the present invention may possess.<br>
Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of a compound<br>
encompasses the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms which said<br>
compound may possess. Said mixture may contain all diastereomers and/or<br>
enantiomers of the basic molecular structure of said compound. All stereochemically<br>
isomeric forms of the compounds of the present invention both in pure form or in<br>
admixture with each other are intended to be embraced within the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Pure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and intermediates as mentioned herein are<br>
defined as isomers substantially free of other enantiomeric or diastereomeric forms of<br>
the same basic molecular structure of said compounds or intermediates. In particular,<br>
the term 'stereoisomerically pure' concerns compounds or intermediates having a<br>
stereoisomeric excess of at least 80% (i. e. minimum 90% of one isomer and maximum<br>
10% of the other possible isomers) up to a stereoisomeric excess of 100% (i.e. 100% of<br>
one isomer and none of the other), more in particular, compounds or intermediates<br>
having a stereoisomeric excess of 90% up to 100%, even more in particular having a<br>
stereoisomeric excess of 94% up to 100% and most in particular having a<br>
stereoisomeric excess of 97% up to 100%. The terms 'enantiomerically pure' and<br>
'diastereomerically pure' should be understood in a similar way, but then having regard<br>
to the enantiomeric excess, respectively the diastereomeric excess of the mixture in<br>
question.<br>
Pure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and intermediates of this invention may<br>
be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. For instance, enantiomers may<br>
be separated from each other by the selective crystallization of their diastereomeric<br>
salts with optically active acids. Alternatively, enantiomers may be separated by<br>
chromatographic techniques using chiral stationary phases. Said pure stereochemically<br>
isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically<br>
isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs<br>
stereospecifically. Preferably, if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will<br>
be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will<br>
advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.<br>
The diastereomeric racemates of formula (I) can be obtained separately by conventional<br>
methods. Appropriate physical separation methods which may advantageously be<br>
employed are, for example, selective crystallization and chromatography, e.g. column<br>
chromatography.<br>
It is clear to a person skilled in the art that the compounds of formula (I) contain at least<br>
one asymmetric center and thus may exist as different stereoisomeric forms. This<br>
asymmetric center is indicated with a asterisk (*) in the figure below.<br>
The absolute configuration of each asymmetric center that may be present in the<br>
compounds of formula (I) may be indicated by the stereochemical descriptors R and S,<br>
this R and S notation corresponding to the rules described in Pure Appl. Chem. 1976,<br>
45, 11-30. The carbon atom marked with the asterisk (*) preferably has the R<br>
configuration.<br>
The present invention is also intended to include all isotopes of atoms occurring on the<br>
present compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but<br>
different mass numbers. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of<br>
hydrogen include tritium and deuterium. Isotopes-of carbon include C-13 and C-14.<br>
Whenever used hereinafter, the term "compounds of formula (I)", or "the present<br>
compounds" or similar term is meant to include the compounds of general formula (I),<br>
their JV-oxides, salts, stereoisomeric forms, racemic mixtures, prodrugs, esters and<br>
metabolites, as well as their quatemized nitrogen analogues.<br>

Interestingly, the compounds of the present invention may comprise chemically<br>
reactive moieties capable of forming covalent bonds to localized sites such that said<br>
compound have increased tissue retention and half-lives. The term "chemically reactive<br>
group" as used herein refers to chemical groups capable of forming a covalent bond.<br>
Reactive groups will generally be stable in an aqueous environment and will usually be<br>
carboxy, phosphoryl, or convenient acyl group, either as an ester or a mixed anhydride,<br>
or an imidate, or a maleimidate thereby capable of forming a covalent bond with<br>
functionalities such as an amino group, a hydroxy or a thiol at the target site on for<br>
example blood components.<br>
4<br>
Upon administration to an individual in need thereof, said compound is capable of<br>
forming covalent bonds to localized sites, with blood component for example, such that<br>
said compound according to the invention has increased tissue retention and half-lives.<br>
Usually, the covalent bond that is formed should be able to be maintained during the<br>
lifetime of the blood component, unless it is intended to be a release site. A major<br>
advantage of said new compound is the small amount of compound necessary to<br>
provide an effective effect. The reasons for this advantage are explained by the<br>
targeting of the delivery, the high yield of reaction between the reactive entity Y and<br>
reactive functionality and the irreversible nature of the bond formed after reaction.<br>
Furthermore, once bound to the membrane or tissue said compound according to the<br>
invention is not susceptible to liver metabolism, kidney filtration and excretion, and<br>
may even be protected from protease (inclusive of endopeptidase) activity which<br>
usually leads to loss of activity and accelerated elimination.<br>
"Blood components" as used herein refers to either fixed or mobile blood components.<br>
Fixed blood components are non-mobile blood components and include tissues,<br>
membrane receptors, interstitial proteins, fibrin proteins, collagens, platelets,<br>
endothelial cells, epithelial cells and their associated membrane and membranous<br>
receptors, somatic body cells, skeletal and smooth muscle cells, neuronal components,<br>
osteocytes and osteoclasts and all body tissues especially those associated with the<br>
circulatory and lymphatic systems. Mobile blood components are blood components<br>
that do not have a fixed situs for any extended period of time, generally not exceeding<br>
5, more usually one minute. These blood components are not membrane-associated<br>
and are present in the blood for extended periods of time and are present in a minimum<br>
concentration of at least 0.1 |j,g/ml. Mobile blood components include serum albumin,<br>
transferrin, ferritin and immunoglobulins such as IgM and IgG. The half-life of mobile<br>
blood components is at least about 12 hours.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can generally be prepared using procedures analogous to<br>
those procedures described in WO 95/06030, WO 96/22287, WO 96/28418, WO<br>
96/28463, WO 96/28464, WO 96/28465 and WO 97/18205.<br>
Particular reaction procedures to make the present compounds are described below. In<br>
the preparations described below,the reaction products may be isolated from the<br>
medium and, if necessary, further purified according to methodologies generally known<br>
in the art such as, for example, extraction, crystallization, trituration and<br>
chromatography.<br>
The 2-acetamido-6-chlorosulfonylbenzothiazole (intermediate a-2) was prepared<br>
following the procedure described in EP-A-0,445,926. Intermediates a-4 were<br>
prepared by reacting an intermediate a-3, prepared according to the procedure<br>
described in WO97/18205 and also depicted in scheme F, with an intermediate a-2 in a<br>
reaction-inert solvent such as dichloromethane, and in the presence of a base such, as<br>
triethylamine and at low temperature, for example at 0 °C. The Boc group in the<br>
intermediate a-3 is a protective tert-butyloxycarbonyl group. It may conveniently be<br>
replaced by another suitable protective group such as phtalimido or benzyloxycarbonyl.<br>
Using intermediate a-4 as a starring material, intermediate a-5 was deprotected using an<br>
acid such as trifluoro acetic acid in a suitable solvent such as dicloromethane. The<br>
resulting intermediate may be further reacted with an intermediate of formula<br>
Ri-L-(leaving group) in the presence of a base such as triethylamine and optionally in<br>
the presence of l-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcafbodiimide hydrochloric acid<br>
(EDC) or an alcohol such as terf-butanol, and in a suitable solvent such as<br>
dichloromethane; thus forming intermediates a-6. Particularly, intermediates of<br>
formula Ri-C(=O)-OH are suitable to further react with an intermediate a-5.<br>
Alternatively, intermediates a-4 may be deprotected with a strong acid such as<br>
hydrochloric acid in isopropanol, in a suitable solvent such as a mixture of ethanol and<br>
dioxane, thus preparing an intermediate a-7. 'Intermediates a-8 can be prepared<br>
analogously to the procedure described for the preparation of intermediates a-6.<br>
Intermediate b-5 can be prepared according, to the procedure described in scheme A.<br>
The aminobenzothiazole derivative b-5 can be de-aminated by for instance treatment<br>
with sodium nitrite in combination with phosphoric acid, and subsequently with copper<br>
sulphate and sodium chloride, thus obtaining an intermediate b-6. Intermediate b-6<br>
may then be reacted with an intermediate of formula Ri-L-(leaving group) in the<br>
presence of a base such as triethylamine and optionally in the presence of EDC or an<br>
alcohol such as t-butanol, and in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane, thus<br>
obtaining an intermediate b-8. Intermediate b-8 may further be derivatized with an<br>
amine of formula FLjN-A-Re in a suitable solvent such as acetonitrile to obtain an<br>
intermediate b-9. Alternatively, intermediates b-6 may first be reacted with H^N-A-Re<br>
and then with formula Ri-L-(leaving group) as is shown in scheme B. Intermediate b-9<br>
can finally be further reacted with R5COC1 or a functional equivalent thereof in the<br>
presence of a base such as triethylamine and in a suitable solvent such as<br>
dichloromethane. Conveniently, said reaction is carried out under an inert atmosphere.<br>
-<br>
An alternative way of preparing compounds of formula (I) is exemplified in scheme C.<br>
Intermediate c-1, prepared according to the procedure described in US 6,140,505, was<br>
reacted with thiocarbonyldiimidazole in* a reaction inert solvent such as<br>
tetrahydrofuran, and the resulting intermediate was further reacted with an amine such<br>
as for instance dimethylethylamine, thus obtaining the thiourea derivative c-2. Said<br>
intermediate c-2 was then cyclized with bromine in the presence of an acid such as<br>
acetic acid, thus obtaining a benzthiazole derivative c-3. The following two steps in<br>
scheme C are analogous as those described for the preparation of intermediates a-5 and<br>
a-6 in scheme A. If so desired, intermediate c-5 can be TV-oxidized using for example<br>
meta chloroperbenzoic acid in dichloromethane.<br>
A particular way of preparing acetamide substituted benzothiazoles is depicted in<br>
scheme D.<br>
Scheme D<br>
hitermediate d-1, prepared following the procedure as described in Scheme A, may be<br>
reacted with chloroacetylchloride, or a functional analogue, in the presence of a base<br>
such as triethylamine and in a solvent such as 1,4-dioxane in order to obtain an amide<br>
of formula d-2. Said intermediate d-2 can further be reacted with an amine of formula<br>
NRaRb whereby Ra and Rb are defined as the possible substituents on an amino group<br>
in the variable RS.<br>
Another particular way of preparing acetamide substituted benzothiazoles is depicted in<br>
Intermediate e-2 can be prepared by treating intermediate e-1, prepared following the<br>
procedure described in scheme A, with a base such as sodiumcarbonate in an aqueous<br>
medium such as a water dioxane mixture. The synthesis steps depicted in scheme E to<br>
obtain intermediate e-6 are all analogous to reaction procedures described in the above<br>
synthesis schemes.<br>
A. number of intermediates and starting materials used in the foregoing preparations are<br>
known compounds, while others may be prepared according to art-known<br>
methodologies of preparing said or similar compounds.<br>
Scheme F<br>
Intermediate f-2, corresponding to intermediate a-3 in scheme A, may be prepared by<br>
adding an amine of formula tySf-Ri to an intermediate f-1 in a suitable solvent such as<br>
isopropanol.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention may also be prepared according to<br>
the method as depicted in scheme G.<br>
The benzothiazole derivative g-1 may be reacted with chlorosulfonic acid and<br>
subsequently treated with thionylchloride to yield intermediate g-2. Said intennediate<br>
g-2 may be further reacted with intermediate g-3 yielding an intermediate g-4 wherein<br>
PG means a suitable protecting group such as for example Boc,. Said reaction may be<br>
performed in a suitable solvent such as for example 2-methyltetrahydrofuran and<br>
optionally in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine,<br>
The intermediate g-4 may then be reacted with a suitable reagent such as metachloroperoxybenzoic<br>
acid (mCPBA) or magnesium monoperoxyphtalate hexahydrate<br>
(MMPP) in the presence of a suitable solvent such as 2-methyltetrahydrofuran in<br>
ethanol thereby producing intermediates g-5 and g-6.<br>
Intermediates g-S and g-6 may be further derivatized with a compound of formula<br>
HN(Rs)A-Re yielding intermediate g-7 after a deprotection reaction. Intermediate g-7<br>
may then be reacted with an intermediate of formula Ri-L-(leaving group) in the<br>
present of a base such as triethylarnine and optionally in the presence of EDC or an<br>
alcohol such as t-butanol, and in a suitabl^ solvent such as dichloromethane, thus<br>
obtaining the compound g-8 which is compound of formula (I).<br>
Another particular way of preparing some compounds according to the invention is<br>
depicted in scheme H.<br>
After deprotection of the protective group ofh-1 using methods known in the art, such<br>
as HCl in isopropanol when PG is a Boc group, the free amine is reacted with a<br>
carboxylic acid , in the presence of a coupling agent such as EDC and HOBt, in an<br>
organic solvent such as dichloromethane, to yield h-2.<br>
hi one preferred embodiment, the carboxylic acid is the Boc-protected L-tert-Leucine.<br>
h-2 is then deprotected as previously described and reacted with chloroacetic acid in<br>
the presence of EDC and HOBt, in dichloromethane, to give intermediate h-3, which is<br>
further substituted by a primary amine in an organic solvent such as dimethyl<br>
formamide (DMF), under heating conditions, then protected by an adequate protective<br>
group such as Boc, to give intermediate h-4.<br>
Intermediate h^4 is reacted with mefa-chloroperoxybenzoic acid in dichloromethane to<br>
give the sulfoxide h-5. further substituted by an amine of formula NHRsR4 in an<br>
organic solvent such as acetonitrile, under heating conditions. The final compound h-6<br>
is obtained after removal of the protective group as previously described.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may also be converted to the corresponding JV-oxide<br>
forms following art-known procedures for converting a trivalent nitrogen into its Noxide<br>
form as is shown for instance for intermediate c-6 in scheme C. Said W-oxidation<br>
reaction may generally be carried out by reacting the starting material of formula (I)<br>
with an appropriate organic or inorganic peroxide. Appropriate inorganic peroxides<br>
comprise, for example, hydrogen peroxide, alkali metal or earth alkaline metal<br>
peroxides, e.g. sodium peroxide, potassium peroxide; appropriate organic peroxides<br>
may comprise peroxy acids such as, for example, benzenecarboperoxoic acid or halo<br>
substituted benzenecarboperoxoic acid, e.g. 3-chloro-benzenecarboperoxoic acid,<br>
peroxoalkanoic acids, e.g. peroxoacetic acid, alkylhydroperoxides, e.g. tert-bntyl<br>
hydroperoxide. Suitable solvents are, for example, water, lower alkanols, e.g. ethanol<br>
and the like, hydrocarbons, e.g. toluene, ketpnes, e.g. 2-butanone, halogenated<br>
hydrocarbons, e.g. dichloromethane, and mixtures of such solvents.<br>
An interesting group of intermediates are those intermediates of formula a-8, b-9 or d-1<br>
wherein -A-Re is hydrogen. Said intermediates may also have pharmacological<br>
properties similar to those pharmacological properties of the compounds of formula (I).<br>
The present compounds can thus be used in animals, preferably in mammals, and in<br>
particular in humans as pharmaceuticals per se, in mixtures with one another or in the<br>
form of pharmaceutical preparations.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention relates to pharmaceutical preparations which as<br>
active constituents contain an effective dose of at least one of the compounds of<br>
formula (I) in addition to customary pharmaceutically innocuous excipients and<br>
auxiliaries. The pharmaceutical preparations normally contain 0.1 to 90% by weight of<br>
a compound of formula (I). The pharmaceutical preparations can be prepared in a<br>
manner known per se to one of skill in the art. For this purpose, at least one of a<br>
compound of formula (I), together with one or more solid or liquid pharmaceutical<br>
excipients and/or auxiliaries and, if desired, in combination with other pharmaceutical<br>
active compounds, are brought into a suitable administration form or dosage form<br>
which can then be used as a pharmaceutical in human medicine or veterinary medicine.<br>
Pharmaceuticals which contain a compound according to the invention can be<br>
administered orally, parenterally, e.g., intravenously, rectally, by inhalation, or<br>
topically, the preferred administration being dependent on the individual case, e.g., the<br>
particular course of the disorder to be treated. Oral administration is preferred.<br>
The person skilled in the art is familiar on the basis of his expert knowledge with the<br>
auxiliaries which are suitable for the desired pharmaceutical formulation. Beside<br>
solvents, gel-forming agents, suppository bases, tablet auxiliaries and other active<br>
compound carriers, antioxidants, dispersants, emulsifiers, antifoams, flavor corrigents,<br>
preservatives, solubilizers, agents for achieving a depot effect, buffer substances or<br>
colorants are also useful.<br>
Due to their favorable pharmacological properties, particularly their activity against<br>
multi-drug resistant HIV protease enzymes, the compounds of the present invention are<br>
useful in the treatment of individuals infected by HIV and for the prophylaxis of these<br>
individuals. In general, the compounds of the present invention may be useful in the<br>
treatment of warm-blooded animals infected with viruses whose existence is mediated<br>
by, or depends upon, the protease enzyme. Conditions which may be prevented or<br>
treated with the compounds of the present invention, especially conditions associated<br>
with HIV and other pathogenic retroviruses, include AIDS, AIDS-related complex<br>
(ARC), progressive generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL), as well as chronic CNS<br>
diseases caused by retroviruses, such as, for example HIV mediated dementia and<br>
multiple sclerosis.<br>
The compounds of the present invention or any subgroup thereof may therefore be used<br>
as medicines against above-mentioned conditions. Said use as a medicine or method of<br>
treatment comprises the systemic administration to HFV-infected subjects of an amount<br>
effective to combat the conditions associated with HIV and other pathogenic<br>
retroviruses, especially HIV-1. Consequently, the compounds of the present invention<br>
can be used in the manufacture of a medicament useful for treating conditions<br>
associated with HIV and other pathogenic retroviruses, in particular medicaments<br>
useful for treating patients infected with multi-drug resistant HIV virus.<br>
hi a preferred embodiment, the invention relates to the use of a compound of formula<br>
(I) or any subgroup thereof in the manufacture of a medicament for treating or<br>
combating infection or disease associated with multi-drug resistant retrovirus infection<br>
in a mammal, in particular HIV-1 infection. Thus, the invention also relates to a<br>
method of treating a retroviral infection, or a disease associated with multi-drug<br>
resistant retrovirus infection comprising administering to a mammal in need thereof an<br>
effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or a subgroup thereof.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the present inyention relates to the use of formula (I)<br>
or any subgroup thereof in the manufacture of a medicament for inhibiting a protease of<br>
a multi-drug resistant retrovirus in a mammal infected with said retrovirus, in particular<br>
HIV-1 retrovirus.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to the use of formula (I)<br>
or any subgroup thereof in the manufacture of a medicament for inhibiting multi-drug<br>
resistant retroviral replication, in particular HIV-1 replication.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also find use in inhibiting ex vivo<br>
samples containing HIV or expected to be exposed to HIV. Hence, the present<br>
compounds may be used to inhibit HIV present in a body fluid sample which contains<br>
or is suspected to contain or be exposed to HIV.<br>
Also, the combination of an antiretroviral compound and a compound of the present<br>
invention can be used as a medicine. Thus, the present invention also relates to a<br>
product containing (a) a compound of the present invention, and (b) another<br>
antiretroviral compound, as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or<br>
sequential use in treatment of retroviral infections, in particular, in the treatment of<br>
infections with multi-drug resistant retroviruses. Thus, to combat or treat HIV<br>
infections, or the infection and disease associated with HIV infections, such as<br>
Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS Related Complex (ARC), the<br>
compounds of this invention may be co-administered in combination with for instance,<br>
binding inhibitors, such as, for example, dextran sulfate, suramine, polyanions, soluble<br>
CD4; fusion inhibitors, such as, for example, T20, T1249, SHC-C, PRO542; coreceptor<br>
binding inhibitors, such as, for example, AMD 3100 (Bicyclams), TAK 779;<br>

as, for example, nevirapine, delavirdine, efavirenz, 8 and 9-C1 TIBO (tivirapine),<br>
loviride, TMC-125, TMC-120, MKC-442, UC 781, Capravirine, DPC 961, DPC963,<br>
DPC082, DPC083, calanolide A, SJ-3366, TSAO, 4"-dearninated TSAO; RNAse H<br>
inhibitors, such as, for example, SP1093V, PD126338; TAT inhibitors, such as, for<br>
example, RO-5-3335, K12, K37; integrase inhibitors, such as, for example, L 708906,<br>
L 731988; protease inhibitors, such as, for example, amprenavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir,<br>
saquinavir, indinavir, lopinavir, BMS 232632, BMS 186316, DPC 681, DPC 684,<br>
tipranavir, AG1776, DMP 450, L 756425, PD178390, PNU 140135; glycosylation<br>
inhibitors, such as, for example, castanospermine, deoxynojirimycine.<br>
The combination may provide a synergistic effect, whereby viral infectivity and its<br>
associated symptoms may be prevented, substantially reduced, or eliminated<br>
completely.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also be administered in combination with<br>
immunomodulators (e.g., bropirimine, anti-human alpha interferon antibody, IL-2,<br>
methionine enkephalin, interferon alpha, and naltrexone) antibiotics (e.g., pentamidine<br>
isothiorate) , vaccines or hormones (e.g growth hormone) to ameliorate, combat, or<br>
eliminate HIV infection and its symptoms.<br>
For an oral administration form, compounds of the present invention are mixed with<br>
suitable additives, such as excipients, stabilizers or inert diluents, and brought by means<br>
of the customary methods into the suitable administration forms, such as tablets, coated<br>
tablets, hard capsules, aqueous, alcoholic, or oily solutions. Examples of suitable inert<br>
carriers are gum arabic, magnesia, magnesium carbonate, potassium phosphate, lactose,<br>
glucose, or starch, in particular, corn starch. In this case the preparation can be carried<br>
out both as dry and as moist granules. Suitable oily excipients or solvents are vegetable<br>
or animal oils, such as sunflower oil or cod liver oil. Suitable solvents for aqueous or<br>
alcoholic solutions are water, ethanol,. sugar solutions, or mixtures thereof.<br>
Polyethylene glycols and polypropylene glycols are also useful as further auxiliaries for<br>
other administration forms.<br>
For subcutaneous or intravenous administration, the active compounds, if desired with<br>
the substances customary therefor such as solubilizers, emulsifiers or further<br>
auxiliaries, are brought into solution, suspension, or emulsion. The compounds of<br>
formula (I) can also be lyophilized and the lyophilizates obtained used, for example, for<br>
the production of injection or infusion preparations. Suitable solvents are, for example,<br>
water, physiological saline solution or alcohols, e.g. ethanol, propanol, glycerol, in<br>
addition also sugar solutions such as glucose or mannitol solutions, or alternatively<br>
mixtures of the various solvents mentioned.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical formulations for administration in the form of aerosols or<br>
sprays are, for example, solutions, suspensions or emulsions of the compounds of<br>
formula (I) or their physiologically tolerable salts in a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
solvent, such as ethanol or water, or a mixture _of such solvents. If required, the<br>
formulation can also additionally contain other pharmaceutical auxiliaries such as<br>
surfactants, emulsifiers and stabilizers as weir as a propellant. Such a preparation<br>
customarily contains the active compound in a concentration from approximately 0.1 to<br>
50%, in particular from approximately 0.3 to 3% by weight.<br>
In order to enhance the solubility and/or the stability of the compounds of formula (I) in<br>
pharmaceutical compositions, it can be advantageous to employ a-, P- or y-cyclodextrins<br>
or their derivatives. Also co-solvents such as alcohols may improve the<br>
solubility and/or the stability of the compounds of formula (I) in pharmaceutical<br>
compositions. In the preparation of aqueous compositions, addition salts of the subject<br>
compounds are obviously more suitable due to their increased water solubility.<br>
Appropriate cyclodextrins are a-, (3- or y-cyclodextrins (CDs) or ethers and mixed<br>
ethers thereof wherein one or more of the hydroxy groups of the anhydroglucose units<br>
of the cyclodextrin are substituted with Chalky!, particularly methyl, ethyl or<br>
isopropyl, e.g. randomly methylated p-CD; hydroxyCi-ealkyl, particularly<br>
hydroxyethyl, hydroxypropyl or hydroxybutyl; carboxyCi-ealkyl, particularly<br>
carboxymethyl or carboxyethyl; C^galkylcarbonyl, particularly acetyl; CiealkyloxycarbonylCi-<br>
ealkyl or carboxyCi-galkyloxyCi-galkyl, particularly<br>
carboxymethoxypropyl or carboxyethoxypropyl; Ci-galkylcarbonyloxyCi-galkyl,<br>
particularly 2-acetyloxypropyl. Especially noteworthy as complexants and/or<br>
solubilizers are P-CD, randomly methylated (3-CD, 2,6-dimethyl-p-CD,<br>
2-hydroxyethyl-p-CD, 2-hydroxyethyl-y-CD, 2-hydroxypropyl-y-CD and<br>
(2-carboxymethoxy)propyl-p-CD, and in particular 2-hydroxypropyl-p-CD (2-HP-PCD).<br>
The term mixed ether denotes cyclodextrin derivatives wherein at least two<br>
cyclodextrin hydroxy groups are etherified with different groups such as, for example,<br>
hydroxy-propyl and hydroxyethyl.<br>
An interesting way of formulating the present compounds in combination with a<br>
cyclodextrin or a derivative thereof has been described in EP-A-721,331. Although the<br>
formulations described therein are with antifungal active ingredients, they are equally<br>
interesting for formulating the compounds of the present invention. The formulations<br>
described therein are particularly suitable for oral administration and comprise an<br>
antifungal as active ingredient, a sufficient amount of a cyclodextrin or a derivative<br>
thereof as a solubilizer, an aqueous acidic medium as bulk liquid carrier and an<br>
alcoholic co-solvent that greatly simplifies the preparation of the composition. Said<br>
formulations may also be rendered more palatable by adding pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable sweeteners and/or flavors.<br>
Other convenient ways to enhance the solubility of the compounds of the present<br>
invention in pharmaceutical compositions are described in WO-94/05263, PCT<br>
application No. PCT/EP98/01773, EP-A-499,299 and WO 97/44014, all incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
More in particular, the present compounds may be formulated in a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of particles consisting of a<br>
solid dispersion comprising (a) a compound of formula (I), and (b) one or more<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable water-soluble polymers.<br>
The term "a solid dispersion" defines a system in a solid state (as opposed to a liquid or<br>
gaseous state) comprising at least two components, wherein one component is<br>
dispersed more or less evenly throughout the other component or components. When<br>
said dispersion of the components is such that the system is chemically and physically<br>
uniform or homogenous throughout or consists of one phase as defined in thermodynamics,<br>
such a solid dispersion is referred to as "a solid solution". Solid solutions are<br>
preferred physical systems because the components therein are usually readily<br>
bioavailable to the organisms to which they are administered.<br>
The term "a solid dispersion" also comprises dispersions which are less homogenous<br>
throughout than solid solutions. Such dispersions are not chemically and physically<br>
uniform throughout or comprise more than one phase.<br>
The water-soluble polymer in the particles is conveniently a. polymer that has an<br>
apparent viscosity of 1 to 100 mPa.s when dissolved in a 2 % aqueous solution at solution.<br>
Preferred water-soluble polymers are hydroxypropyl methylcelluloses or HPMC.<br>
HPMC having a methoxy degree of substitution from about 0.8 to about 2.5 and a<br>
hydroxypropyl molar substitution from about 0.05 to about 3.0 are generally water<br>
soluble. Methoxy degree of substitution refers to the average number of methyl ether<br>
groups present per anhydroglucose unit of the cellulose molecule. Hydroxy-propyl<br>
molar substitution refers to the average number of moles of propylene oxide which<br>
have reacted with each anhydroglucose unit of the cellulose molecule.<br>
The particles as defined hereinabove can be prepared by first preparing a solid<br>
dispersion of the components, and then optionally grinding or milling that dispersion.<br>
-32-<br>
Various techniques exist for preparing solid dispersions including melt-extrusion,<br>
spray-drying and solution-evaporation, melt-extrusion being preferred.<br>
It may further be convenient to formulate the present compounds in the form of<br>
nanoparticles which have a surface modifier adsorbed on the surface thereof in an<br>
amount sufficient to maintain an effective average particle size of less than 1000 nm.<br>
Useful surface modifiers are believed to include those which physically adhere to the<br>
surface of the atitiretro viral agent but do not chemically bond to the antiretroviral agent.<br>
Suitable surface modifiers can preferably be selected from known organic and<br>
inorganic pharmaceutical excipients. Such excipients include various polymers, low<br>
molecular weight oligomers, natural products and surfactants. Preferred surface<br>
modifiers include nonionic and anionic surfactants.<br>
Yet another interesting way of formulating the present compounds involves a<br>
pharmaceutical composition whereby the present compounds are incorporated in<br>
hydrophilic polymers and applying this mixture as a coat film over many small beads,<br>
thus yielding a composition with good bioavailability which can conveniently be<br>
manufactured and which is suitable for preparing pharmaceutical dosage forms for oral<br>
administration.<br>
Said beads comprise (a) a central, rounded or spherical core, (b) a coating film of a<br>
hydrophilic polymer and an antiretroviral agent and (c) a seal-coating polymer layer.<br>
Materials suitable for use as cores in the beads are manifold, provided that said<br>
materials are pharmaceutically acceptable and have appropriate dimensions and<br>
firmness. Examples of such materials are polymers, inorganic substances, organic<br>
substances, and saccharides and derivatives thereof.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention concerns a kit or container comprising a<br>
compound of formula (I) in an amount effective for use as a standard or reagent in a<br>
test or assay for determining the ability of a potential pharmaceutical to inhibit HIV<br>
protease, HIV growth, or both. This aspect of the invention may find its use in<br>
pharmaceutical research programs.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be used in high-throughput target-analyte<br>
assays such as those for measuring the efficacy of said compound in HIV treatment.<br>
The compovmds of the present invention can be used in phenotypic resistance<br>
monitoring assays, such as known recombinant assays, in the clinical management of<br>
resistance developing diseases such as HIV. A particularly useful resistance<br>
TK/f monitoring system is a recombinant assay known as the Antivirogram . The<br>
Antivirogram™ is a highly automated, high throughput, second generation,<br>
recombinant assay that can measure susceptibility, especially viral susceptibility, to the<br>
compounds of the present invention. (Hertogs K, de Bethune MP, Miller V et al.<br>
Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 1998; 42(2)-.269-276, incorporated by reference).<br>
The dose of the present compounds or of the physiologically tolerable salt(s) thereof to<br>
be administered depends on the individual case and, as customary, is to be adapted to<br>
the conditions of the individual case for an optimum effect. Thus it depends, of course,<br>
on the frequency of administration and on the potency and duration of action of the<br>
compounds employed in each case for therapy or prophylaxis, but also on the nature<br>
and severity of the infection and symptoms, and on the sex, age, weight and individual<br>
responsiveness of the human or animal to be treated and on whether the therapy is acute<br>
or prophylactic. Customarily, the daily dose of a compound of formula (I) in the case<br>
of administration to a patient approximately 75 kg in weight is 1 mg to Ig, preferably<br>
3 mg to 0.5 g. The dose can be administered in the form of an individual dose, or<br>
divided into several, e.g. two, three, or four, individual doses.<br>

Compound<br>
Antiviral analyses:<br>
The compounds of the present invention were examined for anti-viral activity in a<br>
cellular assay. The assay demonstrated that these compounds exhibited potent anti-<br>
HIV activity against a wild type laboratory HIV strain (HIV-1 strain LAI). The cellular<br>
assay was performed according to the following procedure.<br>
Cellular Assay Experimental Method;<br>
HIV- or mock-infected MT4 cells were incubated for five days in the presence of<br>
various concentrations of the inhibitor. At the end of the incubation period, all HIVinfected<br>
cells have been killed by the replicating virus in the control cultures in the<br>
absence of any inhibitor. Cell viability is measured by measuring the concentration of<br>
MTT, a yellow, water soluble tetrazolium dye that is converted to a purple, water<br>
insoluble formazan in the mitochondria of living cells only. Upon solubilization of the<br>
resulting formazan crystals with isopropanol, the absorbance of the solution is<br>
monitored at 540nm. The values correlate directly to the number of living cells<br>
remaining in the culture at the completion of the five day incubation. The inhibitory<br>
activity of the compound was monitored on the virus-infected cells and was expressed<br>
as ECso and ECgo. These values represent the amount of the compound required to<br>
protect 50% and 90%, respectively, of the cells from the cytopathogenie effect of the<br>
virus. The toxicity of the compound was measured on the mock-infected cells and was<br>
expressed as CCso, which represents the concentration of compound required to inhibit<br>
the growth of the cells by 50%. The selectivity' index (SI) (ratio CC5o/EC5o) is an<br>
indication of the selectivity of the anti-HIV activity of the inhibitor.<br>
The compounds 1-4, 7, 9-19, 21, 24-26, 28, 33-35, 37-43, 45, 46, 49, 50, 56, 61-64, 66,<br>
68, 70, 71, 75, 79-83 and 88-93 all have an EC50 value against HIV-1 strain LAI of <br>
than 50 nM. The SI for these compounds ranges between about 400 up to more than<br>
47000.<br>
The compounds 5, 6, 20, 22, 23, 29, 36, 44, 47, 48, 51-55, 58, 59, 69, 72-74, 76-78 and<br>
84 all had an EC50 value against HIV-1 strain LAI between 50 nM and 500 nM. The SI<br>
for these compounds ranges between about 26 up to more than 1900.<br>
The compounds 27, 30, 31, 57 and 60 have an EC5o against HIV-1 strain LAI of more<br>
than 500 nM. The SI for these compounds ranges between more than 13 up to more<br>
than 183.<br>
Antiviral spectrum:<br>
Because of the increasing emergence of drug resistant HIV strains, the present<br>
compounds were tested for their potency against clinically isolated HIV strains<br>
harboring several mutations. These mutations are associated with resistance to protease<br>
inhibitors and result in viruses that show various degrees of phenotypic cross-resistance<br>
to the currently commercially available drugs such as for instance saquinavir, ritonavir,<br>
nelfinavir, indinavir and amprenavir.<br>
Results:<br>
As a measure of the broad spectrum activity of the present compounds, the fold<br>
resistance (FR) defined as FR = EC50(mutant strain)/EC50(HrV-l strain LAI). Table 7<br>
shows the results of the antiviral testing hi terms of fold resistance. As can be seen in<br>
this table, the present compounds are effective in inhibiting a broad range of mutant<br>
strains.<br>
presence of human serum, thus evaluating the effect of the binding of the protease<br>
inhibitors to those proteins.<br>
Pharmacokinetic data<br>
The pharmacokinetic properties of compounds 20, 88 and 90 were tested on rats and<br>
dogs. The compounds were evaluated in Whistar rats, source Iffa Credo, weighing<br>
approximately 350 g. Before dosing the animals were fasted overnight (approximately<br>
12 h fasting period). The compounds were dissolved in DMSO. The results represented<br>
in the table concern the results from the oral dosing of the compounds. Blood was<br>
sampled at 30 min, Ih, 2h, 3h, no pre-dose sample was taken. The amount of the<br>
compound in the biological sample was determined using LC-MS. In the table below<br>
"or" means oral dosing, "mpk" means mg per kilogram.<br>
The results are illustrated in Table 8.<br>
A high plasma level can be observed for these compounds and more specifically for the<br>
compound such as compound 20, which is due to the good solubility of said<br>

Biovailabilitv:<br>
The bioavailability of the present compounds was measured in rats. The compounds<br>
were administered orally or intra peritoneal. Animals were sacrificed at different time<br>
points after administration, whole blood was collected and serum prepared by standard<br>
methods. Concentration of the compound in serum was determined by titrating the<br>
anti-HIV activity present in the sample according to the procedure described above.<br>
Serum concentrations were also measured by HPLC-MS.<br>
Protein Binding analyses:<br>
Human serum proteins like albumin (HSA) or alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AAG) are<br>
known to bind many drugs, resulting in a possible decrease in the effectiveness of those<br>
compounds. In order to determine whether the present compounds would be adversely<br>
effected by this binding, the anti-HIV activity of the compounds was measured in the<br><br><br><br>
