COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10; Rule 13]<br>
"A SPARKING 4-STROKE ENGINE"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br>
Original<br><br>
678/MUM/2001<br>
GRANTED<br><br>
- 8 MAY 2006<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a spark ignition 4-stroke engine.<br>
This invention relates to a spark ignition four¬cycle engine wherein a plurality of ignition plugs exposed to the same combustion chamber are attached to a cylinder head. [0002]    . [Prior Art]<br>
Conventionally, a four-cycle engine of the type mentioned is already known from the official,gazette of Domestic Publication of PCT International Publication for Patent Application No. Hei 10-500750 and-. so forth. [0003] [Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In the conventional four-cycle engine described above, a plurality of ignition plugs are attached to a<br>
free space other than an intake valve and an exhaust, valve in order to achieve reduction of the fuel cost and augmentation of the character of exhaust gas. [0004]<br>
Meanwhile, also a configuration wherein an intake port is provided in a cylinder head in an arrangement wherein a swirl is produced in a combustion chamber.in order to augment the combustibility of air fuel mixture is conventionally known well.  If a plurality of ignition<br><br><br>
plugs exposed to the same combustion chamber are attached to a cylinder head of an engine designed with an intention to produce such a swirl as just described, then the ignition plugs are liable to be cooled because air fuel mixture from the intake port contacts with the ignition plug immediately after it flows into the combustion chamber, and there is the possibility that failure in firing by smoking of the ignition plug may occur.<br>
[0005]<br>
The present invention has been made in such a situation as described above, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a spark ignition four-cycle engine which prevents occurrence of failure in firing by smoking of an ignition plug.<br>
[0006] [Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
In order to attain the object described above, according to the present invention as set forth in claim 1, a spark ignition four-cycle engine wherein a plurality of ignition plugs exposed to the same combustion chamber are attached to a cylinder head is characterized in that an intake port is provided in the cylinder head so that a swirl can be produced in the combustion chamber, and the<br><br><br>
plurality of ignition plugs which provide a heating value which increases away from the intake port along a flowing direction of the swirl in the combustion chamber are attached to the cylinder head.<br>
[0007]<br>
With such a configuration as described above, the heating value of the ignition plug with which air fuel mixture flowing into the combustion chamber from the intake port may immediately contact is set comparatively low, and even if the ignition plug is cooled by contact with the air fuel mixture, occurrence of smoking is prevented and occurrence of failure in ignition by smoking can be prevented.<br>
[0008]<br>
Further, the invention as set forth in claim 2 is characterized, in addition to the configuration of the invention given above as set forth in claim 1, in that the intake port which is opened in the combustion chamber above the ignition plug at which the heating value is lowest is provided in the cylinder head which is coupled to a cylinder block having a cylinder axial line extending substantially horizontally.  With such a configuration as just described, even if fuel which runs along an inner face of a lower portion of the intake port<br><br><br>
without being atomized flows into, the combustion chamber; since the heating value of the ignition plug with which the fuel may possibly contact is lowest among the plurality of ignition plugs, occurrence of smoking is prevented, and occurrence of failure in firing by smoking can be prevented.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a spark ignition 4-<br>
stroke engine wherein<br>
a plurality of ignition plugs (49, 50) which are faced with one combustion<br>
chamber (45) being mounted in a cylinder head (39),<br>
an intake port (70) being disposed in said cylinder head (39) for making a<br>
swirl generate in said combustion chamber (45), characterized in that the<br>
intake port (70) is on the plane perpendicular to the axial line of the<br>
cylinder bore (44) and is formed in a shape which has the first path<br>
portion (70a) extending in a tangential direction to the guide   cylinder<br>
(98) on the outer side of the guide cylinder (98) and the tapering second<br>
path portion (70b) contiguous to the first path portion (70a) and curved<br>
in such a manner as to wind part of the guide cylinder (98),<br>
and the valve head portion (74a) of the intake valve (74) and the valve<br>
seat (97) are covered with the opposing wall (39a) of the cylinder head<br>
(39) except the portion which overlaps with the first and second path<br>
portions (70a, 70b),<br>
wherein the calorific value of the ignition plugs (49, 50) mounted in the<br>
cylinder head (39) becomes higher while leaving said intake port (70)<br>
along the flow direction of the swirl in said combustion chamber (45).<br><br><br>

[0031]<br>
Referring particularly to FIG. 5, a valve seat 97 in the form of a ring disposed at an inner end of the intake port 70 is securely mounted by force fitting or the like on the cylinder head 39 at a position displaced from the center of the combustion chamber 45.  The intake valve 74 includes a valve head portion 74a which can be seated on a valve seat 97, and a stem 74b connecting coaxially and integrally to the valve head portion 74a. The stem 74b is fitted for sliding movement in a guide cylinder 98 provided coaxially with the valve seat 97 in the cylinder head 39.  Besides, a valve spring 99 which exerts a spring force for seating the valve head portion 74a on the valve seat 97 is provided between an upper end portion of the stem 74b which projects from the guide cylinder 98 and the cylinder head 39, and the intake side rocker arm 85 of the valve mechanism 76 is connected for<br><br>
interlocking operation to an upper end of the stem 74b. [0032]<br>
An inner end of the exhaust port 71 is disposed such that the center of the combustion chamber 45 is positioned between the inner end of the exhaust port 71 and the inner end of the intake port 70 on a diametrical line of the combustion chamber 45, and the exhaust valve 75 positioned at the inner end of the exhaust port 71 and having a valve head portion 75a to be seated on a valve seat (not shown) securely mounted on the cylinder head 39 is supported for opening and closing movement in a guide cylinder (not shown) secured to the cylinder head 39 in a similar manner to the intake valve 74 is connected for interlocking operation to the exhaust side rocker arm 86 of the valve mechanism 76. [0033]<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, the intake port 70 is provided in the cylinder head 39 so that a swirl may be produced in the combustion chamber 45, and the pair of ignition plugs 49, 50 attached to the cylinder head 39 are set so that the heating value may become higher away from the intake port 70 along a flowing direction 101 of the swirl in the combustion chamber 45.  In particular, the heating value of the ignition plug 49 located immediately on the<br><br><br>
downstream side of the intake port 70 along the flowing direction 101 is set lower than the heating value of the ignition plug 50 positioned farther away from the intake port 70 along the flowing direction 101, and in the present embodiment, the ignition plug 49 having a lower heating value is disposed on the upstream side of the exhaust port 71, that is, the exhaust valve 75, along the flowing direction 101, and the ignition plug 50 having a higher heating value is disposed on the downstream side of the exhaust port 71, that is, the exhaust valve 75, along the flowing direction 101.<br>
[0034]<br>
Besides, since the engine E is carried on the body frame 15 such that the axial line of the cylinder bore 44 thereof extends substantially horizontally and the intake port 70 is disposed at a side wall of an upper portion of the cylinder head 39, in the combustion chamber 45, the ignition plug 49 having a lower heating value is disposed immediately below the opening end of the intake port 70 to the combustion chamber 45, that is, the intake valve 74.<br>
[0035]<br>
By the way, the intake port 70 has such a shape that it produces a swirl in the combustion chamber 45,<br><br><br>
and is formed in such a shape on a projection drawing on a plane perpendicular to the axial line of the cylinder bore 44 that the intake port 70 has, as shown in FIG. 7, a first path portion 70a which extends in a tangential direction to the guide cylinder 98 on the outer side of the guide cylinder 98, and a tapering second path portion 70b contiguous to the first path portion 70a and curved in such a manner as to wind part of the guide cylinder 98.<br>
[0036]<br>
The first path portion 70a extends linearly in a tangential direction to the guide cylinder 98 perpendicularly to a straight line 102 which interconnects, for example, the center C1 of the combustion chamber 45 and the center C2 of the guide cylinder 98.  The second path portion 70b is formed in such a curved shape that it winds part of the guide cylinder 98 without intersecting with the straight line 102 on the projection drawing mentioned above.<br>
[0037]<br>
Referring also to FIG. 8, on the cylinder head 39, an opposing wall 39a (indicated by slanting lines in FIG. 7) which covers the valve head portion 74a of the intake valve 74 and the valve seat 97 except a portion which overlaps with the first and second path portions<br><br>
70a, 70b of the intake port 70 is provided in an opposing relationship to part of the valve head portion 74a and the valve seat 97.  In particular, a portion of the valve seat 97 which is disposed in the form of a ring at the inner end of the intake port 70 functions as a substantial intake valve opening 103, and the intake valve opening 103 which is a region other than the portion of the valve seat 97 which is covered with the opposing wall 39a is opened when the intake valve 74 is opened.<br>
[0038]<br>
An inner side face of the intake port 70 at a portion corresponding to an inner side outer profile line which defines the second path portion 70b is formed from a vertical wall 39b (refer to FIG. 5) provided on the cylinder head 39 perpendicularly to the opposing wall 39a.<br>
[0039]<br>
Now, operation of the present embodiment is described.  The intake port 70 on the projection drawing on the plane perpendicular to the axial line of the cylinder bore 44 is formed in a shape which has the first path portion 70a extending in a tangential direction to the guide cylinder 98 on the outer side of the guide cylinder 98 and the tapering second path portion 70b<br><br><br>
contiguous to the first path portion 70a and curved in such a manner as to wind part of the guide cylinder 98, and the valve head portion 74a of the intake valve 74 and the valve seat 97 are covered with the opposing wall 39a of the cylinder head 39 except the portion which overlaps with the first and second path portions 70a, 70b on the projection drawing. [0040]<br>
Accordingly, air fuel mixture having been introduced by the intake port 70 is taken into the combustion chamber 45 in such a manner that it winds part of the outer periphery of the stem 74b provided on the intake valve 74, but the air fuel mixture is not whirled in the intake port 70.  Therefore, the air fuel mixture can be introduced into the combustion chamber 45 while preventing a drop of the flow rate, and a strong swirl can be formed in the combustion chamber 45.  Besides, since the intake port 70 is required only to be shaped so as to pass air fuel mixture smoothly therethrough, the path resistance in the intake port 70 can be suppressed low.<br>
[0041]<br>
Further, since the cylinder head 39 which forms a wall at an end of the second path portion 70b on the<br><br>
projection drawing mentioned hereinabove is formed in a shape wherein it does not intersect with the straight line 102 which interconnects the center CI of the combustion chamber 45 and the center C2 of the guide cylinder 98, production of a flow of air fuel mixture which flows from the intake port 70 into the combustion chamber 45 in a direction opposite to that of a swirl flow produced in the combustion chamber 45 can be prevented with certainty.  Consequently, the swirl in the combustion chamber 45 can be made further strong.<br>
[0042]<br>
Furthermore, since the inner side face of the intake port 70 at the portion corresponding to the inner side outer profile line of the second path portion 70b is formed from the vertical wall 39b provided on the cylinder head 39 perpendicularly to the opposing wall 39a, the intake port 70 can be inclined so that the intake range of air fuel mixture into the combustion chamber 45 is defined accurately and the angle with respect to the plane perpendicular to the cylinder axial line may be smaller, and consequently, the swirl flow in the combustion chamber 45 can be made further strong.<br>
[0043]<br>
By the way, while a plurality of, for example, a<br><br>
pair of ignition plugs 49, 50 are attached to the cylinder head 39 in such a manner as to be exposed to the combustion chamber 45 in a free space other than the intake valve 74 and the exhaust valve 75 in order to achieve reduction of the fuel cost and augmentation of the character of exhaust gas, the heating values of the ignition plugs 49, 50 are set different from each other, and the heating value of the ignition plug 49 which is positioned nearer to the intake port 70 along the flowing direction 101 of the swirl in the combustion chamber 45 is set lower than the heating value of the ignition plug 50 which is positioned farther from the intake port 70. [0044]<br>
In particular, while the heating value of the ignition plug 50 which is exposed to combustion gas of a comparatively high temperature by combustion of air fuel mixture which has become comparatively lean as a result of progress of evaporation and diffusion of the air fuel mixture in the combustion chamber 45 is set comparatively high, the heating value of the ignition plug 49 which may possibly be cooled by contact with comparatively rich air fuel mixture introduced into the combustion chamber 45 from the intake port 70 is set comparatively low. Consequently, occurrence of failure in ignition at the<br><br><br>
ignition plug 49 by smoking can be prevented.<br>
[0045]<br>
Further, since the engine body 37 is carried on the body frame 15 in a posture wherein the cylinder axial line extends substantially horizontally and the intake port 70 is provided in the cylinder head 39 in such a manner that it is opened in the combustion chamber 45 above the ignition plug 49 at which the heating value is lowest, even if fuel running along the inner face of a lower portion of the intake port 70 without being atomized flows into the combustion chamber 45, since the heating value of the ignition plug 49 with which the fuel may possibly contact is lowest between the ignition plugs 49, 50, occurrence of smoking by contact with the fuel which is not in an atomized state can be prevented, and occurrence of failure in firing by smoking at the ignition plug 49 can be prevented.<br>
[0046]<br>
While an embodiment of the present invention is described above, the present invention is not limited to the embodiment described above, and various design alterations can be made without departing from the spirit of the present invention as set forth in the claims.<br>
[0047]<br><br>
For example, while, in the embodiment described above, the intake port 70 provided in the cylinder head 39 is formed as a swirl port in order to produce a swirl in the combustion chamber 45, the present invention can be applied widely to any engine wherein an intake air flow is introduced into the combustion chamber 45 in a deviated state irrespective of the shape of the intake port, and the heating value of a plurality of ignition plugs should be set along a flow of intake air. [0048] [Effect of the Invention]<br>
As described above, according to the invention as set forth in claim 1, even if the ignition plug is cooled by contact with air fuel mixture having flowed into the combustion chamber from the intake port, occurrence of smoking is prevented and occurrence of failure in ignition by smoking can be prevented. [0049]<br>
Further, according to the invention as set forth in claim 2, even if fuel which runs along an inner face of a lower portion of the intake port without being atomized flows into the combustion chamber, occurrence of smoking at the ignition plug which may possibly contact with the fuel is prevented, and occurrence of failure in firing by smoking can be prevented.  <br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A spark ignition 4-stroke engine wherein<br>
a plurality of ignition plugs (49, 50) which are faced with one combustion chamber (45) being mounted in a cylinder head (39), an intake port (70) being disposed in said cylinder head (39) for making a swirl generate in said combustion chamber (45), characterized in that the intake port (70) is on the plane perpendicular to the axial line of the cylinder bore (44) and is formed in a shape which has the first path portion (70a) extending in a tangential direction to the guide cylinder (98) on the outer side of the guide cylinder (98) and the tapering second path portion (70b) contiguous to the first path portion (70a) and curved in such a manner as to wind part of the guide cylinder (98), and the valve head portion (74a) of the intake valve (74) and the valve seat (97) are covered with the opposing wall (39a) of the cylinder head (39) except the portion which overlaps with the first and second path portions (70a, 70b),<br>
