				<td>METHOD OF MAKING A LITHOGRAPHIC PRINTING PLATE<br>
[DESCRIPTION]<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for making a lithographic printing plate whereby a negative-working photopolymer printing plate precursor is image-wise exposed, heated in a preheating unit within a time period of less than 10 minutes after image-wise exposing and treated with a gum solution in a gumming station, whereby the plate is developed and gummed in a single step.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In lithographic printing, a so-called printing master such as a printing plate is mounted on a cylinder of the printing press. The master carries a lithographic image on its surface and a printed copy is obtained by applying ink to said image and then transferring the ink from the master onto a receiver material, which is typically paper. In conventional, so-called "wet" lithographic printing, ink as well as an aqueous fountain solution (also called dampening liquid) are supplied to the lithographic image which consists of oleophilic (or hydrophobic, i.e. ink-accepting, water-repelling) areas as well as hydrophilic (or oleophobic, i.e. water-accepting, ink-repelling) areas. In so-called "driographic" printing, the lithographic image consists of ink-accepting and ink-abhesive (ink-repelling) areas and during driographic printing, only ink is supplied to the master.<br>
Printing masters are generally obtained by the so-called computer-to-filra (CtF) method, wherein various pre-press steps such as typeface selection, scanning, color separation, screening, trapping, layout and imposition are accomplished digitally and each color selection is transferred to graphic arts film using an image¬setter. After processing, the film can be used as a mask for the exposure of an imaging material called plate precursor and after<br><br>
plate processing, a printing plate is obtained which can be used as a master. Since about 1995, the so-called 'computer-to-plate' (CtP) method has gained a lot of interest. This method, also called 'direct-to-plate', bypasses the creation of film because the digital document is transferred directly to a printing plate precursor by means of a so-called plate-setter. A printing plate precursor for CtP is often called a digital plate.<br>
Digital plates can roughly be divided in three categories : (i) silver plates, which work according to the silver salt diffusion transfer mechanism; (ii) photopolymer plates which contain a photopolymerizable composition that hardens upon exposure to light and (iii) thermal plates of which the imaging mechanism is triggered by heat or by light-to-heat conversion. Thermal plates are mainly sensitized for infrared lasers emitting at 830 nm or 1064 nm. Photopolymers can be sensitized for blue, green or red light {i.e. wavelength range between 450 and 750 nm), for violet light (i.e. wavelength range between 350 and 450 nm) or for infrared light(i.e. wavelength range between 750 and 1500 nm). Laser sources have been increasingly used to expose a printing plate precursor which is sensitized to a corresponding laser wavelength. Typically, an Ar laser (488 nm) or a FD-YAG laser (532 nm) can be used for exposing a visible light sensitized photopolymer plate. The wide-scale availability of low cost blue or violet laser diodes, originally developed for data storage by means of DVD, has enabled the production of plate-setters operating at shorter wavelength. More specifically, semiconductor lasers emitting from 350 to 450 nm have been realized using an InGaN material. An infrared laser diode emitting around 830 nm or a Nd-YAG laser emitting around 1060 nm can also be used.<br>
Typically, a photopolymer plate precursor comprises a support, a photopolymerizable coating and an overcoat. The photopolymer!za±)le coating comprises a polymerizable compound, a polymerization initiator and a binder, and the overcoat comprises usually a polyvinylalcohol binder to hinder the penetration of oxygen in the coating. Upon image-wise exposure, free radicals formed by the initiator are not quenched by the oxygen and can initiate<br><br>
crosslinking and/or polymerization of the polymerizable compound, resulting in hardening or curing of the exposed areas. The exposed precursor is usually processed in alkaline developer having a pH &gt; 10, whereby the overcoat and the photopolymerizable coating at the non-exposed areas are solubilized in the developer solution. US2004/0131974 discloses a method for making such a lithographic printing plate whereby, after image-wise exposure, the overcoat is removed with water in a prewashing step, resulting in a reduction of the formation of sludge in the alkaline developing solution and whereby staining is prevented at the non-image portions.<br>
Currently, most commercial lithographic plates require an additional gumming process after the exposed plates is developed and before it is put on the press, in order to protect the plate from contamination, e.g. by oxidation, fingerprints, fats, oil or dust, or from damaging, e.g. by scratches during handling of the plate. Such an additional gumming step is not convenient for the end-user, because it is a time consuming step and requires an additional gumming station.<br>
WO 02/101 469 discloses a method of processing an imageable element useful as alkaline-developable lithographic printing plate precursor wherein the element is developed and gummed with an aqueous alkaline developing-gumming solution comprising a water-soluble polyhydroxy compound having a specific structure.<br>
EP 1 342 558 discloses a method for making a heat-sensitive lithographic printing plate wherein the image-wise heated precursor, comprising a coating of hydrophobic thermoplastic polymer particles which coalescence on heating, is developed with a gum solution. A practical embodiment for this type of printing plates was introduced by Agfa under the tradename Azura.<br>
In US 6,027,857, US 6,171,735, US 6,420,089, US 6,071,675, US 5,245,481, US 6,387,595, US 6,482,571, US 6,575,401 and US 5,548,222 a method is disclosed for preparing a lithographic printing plate wherein a photopolymer plate, after image-wise exposure, is mounted on a press and processed on-press by applying ink and fountain to remove the unexposed areas from the support. Also US 2003/16577 and US 2 0 04/13 968 disclose a method wherein a plate comprising a<br><br>
photopolymerizable layer can be processed in an on-press processing with fountain and ink or with a non-alkaline aqueous developer. An adhesion promoting compound can also added to the printing plate precursor for improving the developability of the on-press processing and for improving the durability of the plate in the printing process. Typically, these compounds have an ethylenically unsaturated bond and a functional group capable of adsorbing to the surface of the support. Other compounds and polymers can be used as adhesion promoting compound. The compound can be present in the photopolymerisble layer or in an intermediate layer between the support and the photopolymerisable layer as disclosed in EP 851 299, EP 1 091 251, US 2004/214105, EP 1 491 356, US 2005/39620, EP 1 495 866, EP 1 500 498, EP 1 520 694 and EP 1 557 262.<br>
A first problem associated with on-press processing of such photopolymer printing plates is the lack of daylight stability, i.e. the image is not stable before processing and, therefore, the exposed plate needs to be processed within a short time after the exposure. However, since on-press processing is not possible during a print job, the end-user must wait until the previous print job has been completed before the exposed plate can be mounted on the press and processed. As a result, the exposure of the plate for the next print job must be delayed until just before the completion of the previous print job, so as to avoid that the unprocessed plate is affected by the ambient light.  Alternatively, the exposed plate must be kept under safe-light conditions, but this again reduces the ease of use and convenience that are normally associated with e.g. violet- and infrared-sensitive photopolymer plates,<br>
A second problem left unsolved in the prior art about on-press processable photopolymer plates is the lack of a visible image between exposure and processing. Although it is known to add a colorant to the photosensitive coating, so as to obtain a visible image after removal of the non-exposed areas of the coating by the processing, this does not allow to distinguish an exposed plate from an unexposed plate immediately after the image-wise exposure, let alone to inspect the image quality after the exposure, because the visible image is only revealed after the on-press processing.<br><br>
Moreover, on-press processable plates normally do not contain a colorant because the on-press removal of the non-printing areas of the coating may cause contamination of the fountain solution and/or the ink and it may take an unacceptable number of printed copies before the contamination by said colorant has disappeared.<br>
A third problem associated with on-press processing with fountain and ink is an insufficient clean-out of the non-exposed areas.<br>
In the unpublished patent application PCT/EP 2005/052298, filed on 18 May 20 05, a method for making a lithographic printing plate is disclosed wherein the image-wise exposed precursor is developed with a gumming solution.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for making a lithographic printing plate by means of a photopolymer plate precursor, which is perceived by the user as a method which does not require a processing step and wherein the exposed plate can be kept in ambient light during an unlimited time before being mounted on the press. This object is realized by the method defined in claim 1, having the specific feature that the image-wise exposed' plate precursor is heated in a preheating unit within a time period of less than 10 minutes after image-wise exposing, and treated with a gum solution in a gumming station comprising at least one gumming unit whereby the plate is developed and gummed in a single step. Since the plate is developed and gummed, the lithographic image can no longer be affected by ambient daylight. On the contrary, further exposure to daylight would only increase the polymerization degree of the exposed areas, i.e. would strengthen rather than deteriorate the image. In addition, the present inventors have observed that by heating the precursor in a preheating unit within a time period of less than 10 minutes after image-wise exposing the stability of the latent image is improved, resulting in reproducing of images of high resolution.<br><br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method for making a lithographic printing plate by means of a photopolymer plate precursor, which is perceived by the user as a method which does not require a processing step and wherein the exposed plate can be kept in ambient light during an unlimited time before being mounted on the press, and wherein a visible image is provided before mounting the plate on the press. This object is realized by adding a colorant to the coating of the photopolymer plate. Since the non-printing areas of the coating are removed in the gumming units, there is no risk of contamination of the fountain solution or ink during the start of the print job.<br>
Other specific embodiments of the invention are defined in the dependent claims.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a steps of:<br>
a)	providing a lithographic printing plate precursor comprising<br>
(i) a support having a hydrophilic surface or which is provided<br>
with a hydrophilic layer, (ii) a coating on said support, comprising a photopolymerizable layer and, optionally, an intermediate layer<br>
between the photopolymerizable layer and the support, wherein said photopolymerizable layer comprises a polymerizable compound, a polymerization initiator and a binder,<br>
b)	image-wise exposing said coating in a plate setter,<br>
c)	heating the precursor in a preheating unit within a time period of less than 10 minutes after step (b),<br>
d)	treating the precursor in a gumming station, comprising at least one gumming unit, whereby a gum solution is applied to the precursor, thereby removing non-exposed areas of the<br>
photopolymerizable layer from the support and gumming the plate in a single step.<br><br>
In the present invention, the printing plate precursor is image-wise exposed off-press by means of a plate setter, i.e. a laser exposure apparatus suitable for image-wise exposing a precursor. The precursor used in the method of the present invention is negative-working whereby at the exposed areas the coating is hardened. Here, "hardened" means that the coating becomes insoliible or non-dispersible for the gum solution and may be achieved through polymerization and/or crosslinking of the coating.<br>
After imaging, the plate precursor is heated, hereinafter also referred to as '^pre-heat" or "preheat", to enhance or to speed-up the polymerization and/or crosslinking reaction. This preheat step is carried out within a time period of less than 10 minutes, preferably less than 5 minutes, more preferably less than 1 minutes, most preferably the preheat is carried out immediately after the image-wise exposing, i.e. within less than 3 0 seconds. There is no time limit before the heating may start, but the precursor is heated as soon as possible after exposing, usually after a few seconds to transport the plate to the preheating unit and start the heating process. In this heating step, the precursor is heated at a temperature of preferably 80°C to 15 0°C and during a dwell time of preferably 5 seconds to 1 minute. The preheating unit is preferably provided with heating elements such as IR-lamps, UV-lamps, heated air, a heated metal roll, etc.<br>
Subsequently to the preheat step, the plate precursor is treated, i.e. developed and gummed, in a gumming station which comprises at least one gumming unit, preferably two gumming units, namely a first and a second gumming unit. In the gumming unit{s), a gum solution is applied to the coating of the precursor whereby the non-exposed areas of the photopolymerizable layer is removed from the support and whereby the hydrophilic surface of the support at the non-exposed areas are protected by adsorption of gum in a single step. When the precursor is treated with a gum solution firstly in a first gumming unit and subsequently in a second gumming unit, an additional benefit is obtained whereby contamination of the gum solution of the second gumming unit is reduced, whereby an increase of the viscosity of the gum solution of the second gumming unit can<br><br>
be reduced or inhibited and that sludge formation in the second gumming unit is retarded or inhibited. This results in an improved lifetime of the gum solution of the second gumming unit whereby this gum solution, optionally combined with regeneration (e.g. filtering) and/or adding replenishing solution, can be used for developing and gumming a higher number of plates which is cost saving and friendly for the environment.<br>
The development with a gum solution has the additional benefit that, due to the remaining gum on the plate at the non-exposed areas, an additional gumming step is not required to protect the surface of the support at the non-exposed areas. As a result, the precursor is processed and gummed in one single step and the obtained lithographic image on the plate will not be affected by ambient daylight or by contamination.<br>
In the printing step, the plate is mounted on the plate cylinder of the printing press and the printing process is started.<br>
The gum solution<br>

Still other baking gumming solutions contains the potassium salt of the hydroxyethylidene diphosphonic<br><br>
acid. Still other baking gumming solutions contain a sulphosuccinamate compound and phosphoric acid.<br>
The contact angle between the baking gum solution and the plate is preferably lowered by adding at least one surfactant. Preferred surfactants are non-ionic polyglycols and perfluorated aliphatic polyester acrylates.<br>

The support<br>
A particularly preferred lithographic support is an electrochemically grained and anodized aluminum support. Graining an anodizing of aluminum supports is well known. The acid used for graining can be e.g. nitric acid or sulfuric acid. The acid used for graining preferably comprises hydrogen chloride. Also mixtures of e.g. hydrogen chloride and acetic acid can be used. The relation between electrochemical graining and anodizing parameters such as electrode voltage, nature and concentration of the acid electrolyte<br>
or power consumption on the one hand and the obtained lithographic<br>
2 quality in terms of Ra and anodic weight (g/m of AI2O3 formed on<br>
the aluminum surface) on the other hand is well known. More details about the relation between various production parameters and Ra or anodic weight can be found in e.g. the article "Management of Change in the Aluminium Printing Industry" by F. R. Mayers, published in the ATB Metallurgie Journal, volume 42 nr. 1-2 (2002) pag. 69.<br>
The anodized aluminum support may be subject to a so-called post-anodic treatment to improve the hydrophilic properties of its surface.  For example, the aluminum support may be silicated by treating its surface with a sodium silicate solution at elevated temperature, e.g. 95°C.  Alternatively, a phosphate treatment may be applied which involves treating the aluminum oxide surface with a phosphate solution that may further contain an inorganic fluoride. Further, the aluminum oxide surface may be rinsed with a citric acid<br><br>
or citrate solution.  This treatment may be carried out at room temperature or may be carried out at a slightly elevated temperature of about 30 to 50°C.  A further interesting treatment involves rinsing the aluminum oxide surface with a bicarbonate solution. Still further, the aluminum oxide surface may be treated with polyvinylphosphonic acid, polyvinylmethylphosphonic acid, phosphoric acid esters of polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylsulfonic acid, polyvinylbenzenesulfonic acid, sulfuric acid esters of polyvinyl alcohol, and acetals of polyvinyl alcohols formed by reaction with a sulfonated aliphatic aldehyde.<br>

In another embodiment the polymeric binder comprises a hydrophobic backbone, and pendant groups including for example a hydrophilic poly(alkylene oxide) segment. The polymeric binder may also include pendant cyano groups attached to the hydrophobic backbone. A combination of such binders may also be employed. Generally the polymeric binder is a solid at room temperature, and is typically a non-elastomeric thermoplastic. The polymeric binder comprises both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions, which is thought to be important for enhancing differentiation of the exposed and unexposed areas by facilitating developability. Generally the polymeric binder is characterized by a number average molecular weight (Mn)in the range from about 10.000 to 250.000, more commonly in the range from about 25.0 00 to 200.000. The polymerizable<br><br>
composition may comprise discrete particles of the polymeric binder. Preferably the discrete particles are particles of the polymeric binder which are suspended in the polymerizable composition. The presence of discrete particles tends to promote developability of the unexposed areas. Specific examples of the polymeric binders according to this embodiment are described in US 6.8 99.994, 2004/0260050, US2005/0003285, US2005/0170286 and US2005/0123B53 .

Specific examples of self-dispersing pigments are pigments with are subjected to a surface treatment in such a way the pigment surface is compatible with the dispersing liquid. Typical examples of self-dispersing pigments in an aqueous medium are pigments which have ionic or ionisable groups or polyethyleneoxide chains coupled to the particle-surface.

preferably about 0.01 g/m to 0.1 g/m .<br>
The colorant can also be a dye. Any known dyes, such as commercially available dyes or,dyes described in, for example, "Dye Handbook" (edited by the Organic Synthetic Chemistry Association, published in 1970) which are colored for the human eye, can be used<br><br>

g/m , more preferably about 0.01 g/m to 0.2 g/m , most preferably<br>
2	2<br>
about 0.01 g/m to 0.1 g/m .<br>
Printing-out agent<br>
The photopolymerizable layer or another layer of the coating may also comprise a printing-out agent, i.e. a compound which is capable of changing the color of the coating upon exposure. After image-wise exposing of the precursor, a visible image can be produced, hereinafter also referred to as "print-out image". The printing-out agent may be a compound as described in EP-A-1 491 356 paragraph [0116] to [0119] on page 19 and 20, and in US 2005/8971 paragraph [0168] to [0172] on page 17. Preferred printing-out agents are the compounds described in the unpublished PCT Application PCT/EP 2005/053141, filed on 1 July 2005, from line 1 page 9 to line 27 page 20. More preferred are the IR-dyes as described in the unpublished Patent Application EP 05 105 440.1, filed on 21 June 2005, from line 32 page 5 to line 9 page 32.<br><br>
The contrast<br>
The contrast of the image formed after image-wise exposure and processing with a gum solution is defined as the difference between the optical density at the exposed area to the optical density at the non-exposed area, and this contrast is preferably as high as possible. This enables the end-user to establish immediately whether or not the precursor has already been exposed and processed with a gum solution, to distinguish the different color selections and to inspect the quality of the image on the treated plate precursor.<br>
The contrast increases with increasing optical density in the exposed area and/or decreasing optical density in the non-exposed areas. The optical density in the exposed area may increase with the amount and extinction coefficient of the colorant remaining in the exposed areas and the intensity of color formed by the printing-out agent. In the non-exposed areas it is preferred that the amount of colorant is as low as possible and that the intensity of color print-out agent is as low as possible. The optical density can be measured in reflectance by an optical densitometer, equipped with several filters (e.g. cyan, magenta, yellow). The difference in optical density at the exposed area and the non-exposed area has preferably a value of at least 0.3, more preferably at least 0.4, most preferably at least 0.5. There is no specific upper limit for the contrast value, but typically the contrast is not higher than 3 .0 or even not higher than 2.0. In order to obtain a good visual contrast for a human observer the type of color of the colorant may also be important. Preferred colors for the colorant are cyan or blue colors, i.e. under blue color we understand a color that appears blue for the human eye.<br>
The toplayer<br>
The coating may comprise a top layer which acts as an oxygen barrier layer, hereinafter also referred to as "overcoat layer" or "overcoat". Preferred binders which can be used in the top layer are polyvinyl alcohol and the polymers disclosed in EP-A-3103498, filed<br><br>
on 22/09/2003, US 6,410,205 and EP 1 288 720, including the cited references in these patents and patent applications. The most preferred binder for the toplayer is polyvinylalcohol. The polyvinylalcohol has preferably an hydrolysis degree ranging between 74 mol % and 99 mol %. The weight average molecular weight of the polyvinylalcohol can be measured by the viscosity of an aqueous •solution, 4 % by weight, at 20°C as defined in DIN 53 015, and this viscosity number ranges preferably between 3 and 26, more preferably between 3 and 15, most preferably between 3 and 10.<br>
The coating thickness of the top layer is preferably between<br>
2	2<br>
0.25 and 1.75 g/m , more preferably between 0.25 and 1.3 g/m , most<br>
2 preferably between 0.25 and 1.0 g/m . In a more preferred embodiment<br>
of the present invention, the toplayer has a coating thickness<br>
2<br>
between 0.25 and 1.75 g/m and comprises a polyvinylalcohol having<br>
an hydrolysis degree ranging between 74 mol % and 99 mol % and a viscosity number as defined above ranging between 3 and 26.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the composition and the thickness of of the toplayer are optimised in order to obtain a high sensitivity, a good daylight stability and less or no sludge formation during processing. In order to reduce sludge, the toplayer comprises less polyvinylalcohol and polyvinylalcohol with a lower molecular weight, preferably a viscosity number of less than 26, more preferably less than lOis used and a thickness as low as possible but more than 0.25 g/m . In order to improve the sensitivity, the good oxygen barrier is desired, using a polyvinylalcohol with a high hydrolysis degree, preferably 88-98%, and a bigger thickness or the toplayer. In order to improve the daylight stability, small penetration of oxygen is desired by a using an oxygen barrier with reduced barrier property for oxygen, preferably by using a smaller thickness of the toplayer and with polyvinylalcohol having a lower hydrolysis degree. Due to a good balance of these elements, an optimised property for the precursor can be obtained.<br>
The top layer may also comprise a component selected from the compounds of the gum solution as. described above.<br><br>
Exposure<br>
The image-wise exposing step is carried out off-press in a plate setter, i.e. an exposure apparatus suitable for image-wise exposing the precursor by a laser such as a laser diode, emitting around 830 nm, a NdYAG laser, emitting around 1060 nm, a violet laser, emitting around 400 nm, or a gas laser such as Ar laser, or by a digital modulated UV-exposure, e.g. by means of digital mirror devices, or by a conventional exposure in contact with a mask. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the precursor is image-wise exposed by a laser emitting IR-light or violet light.<br>
Preheating<br>
After this image-wise exposing step the precursor is heated in a preheating unit to enhance or to speed-up the polymerization and/or crosslinking reaction. This preheat step is carried out within a time period of less than 10 minutes, preferably less than 5 minutes, more preferably less than 1 minutes, most preferably the preheat is carried out immediately after the image-wise exposing, i.e. within less than 30 seconds. There is no time limit before the heating may start, but the precursor is heated as soon as possible after exposing, usually after a few seconds to transport the plate to the preheating unit and start the heating process. In this heating step, the precursor is heated at a temperature of preferably 80°C to 150°C and during a dwell time of preferably 5 seconds to l minute. The preheating unit is preferably provided with heating elements such as IR-lamps, UV-lamps, heated air, a heated metal roll, etc.<br>
Washing<br><br>
After the preheating step, and before the gum-developing step, the precursor may be washed in a prewashing station, whereby at least part of the toplayer can be removed by supplying a wash liquid, i.e. water or an aqueous solution, to the coating of the precursor. The washing liquid is preferably water, more preferably tap water.<br>
The term aqueous includes water or mixtures of water with water-miscible organic solvents such as alcohols, e.g. methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, butanol, iso-amyl alcohol, octanol, cetyl alcohol, etc.; glycols, e.g. ethylene glycol; glycerine; N-methyl pyrrolidone; methoxypropanol; and ketones, e.g. 2-ptopanone and 2-butanone; etc. The water-miscible organic solvent may be present in these mixtures of at most 50 % by weight, preferably less than 20 % by weight, more preferably less than 10% by weight, most preferably no organic solvent is present in the aqueous solution.

The wash liquid used in this step has preferably a temperature ranging between 15°C and 85°C, more preferably between 18°C and 65°C, most preferably between 2 0°C and 55°C.<br>
The prewashing station may comprise at least one prewashing unit wherein the wash liquid is applied to the precursor by a spraying, jetting, dipping or coating technique, including spin coating, roll coating, slot coating or gravure coating, or by rubbing in with an impregnated pad or by pouring-in, either by hand or in an automatic apparatus. The spraying, jetting, dipping or coating technique are preferred.<br>
An example of a spray nozzle which can be used in the spraying technique, is an air assisted spray nozzle of the type SUJl, commercially available at Spraying Systems Belgium, Brussels. The spray nozzle may be mounted on a distance of 50 mm to 200 mm between nozzle and receiving substrate.  The flow rate of the spray solution may be set to 7 ml/min.  During the spray process an air pressure in<br>
the range of 4.80x10^ Pa may be used on the spray head. This layer<br><br>
may be dried during the spraying process and/or after the spraying process. Typical examples of jet nozzles which can be used in the jetting technique, are ink-jet nozzles and valve-jet nozzles.<br>
At least one of the prewashing units may be provided with at least one roller for rubbing and/or brushing the coating while applying the wash liquid to the coating.<br>
The wash liquid used in the prewashing step can be collected in a tank and the washing liquid can be used several times. The wash liquid can be replenished by adding fresh water and/or fresh aqueous solution to the tank of the prewashing unit. Said fresh water and fresh aqueous solution are respectively water and aqueous solution which have not been used before for washing a precursor. In an alternative way, the wash liquid may be used once-only, i.e. only fresh water or fresh aqueous solution is applied to the coating by preferably a spraying or jetting technique. Preferably tap water is used in this alternative way.<br>
The prewashing station may comprise two or more prewashing units, preferably two or three prewashing units.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the prewashing station comprises a first and a second prewashing unit whereby the precursor is firstly washed in the first prewashing unit and subsequently washed in the second prewashing unit. The precursor can be firstly washed in the first prewashing unit with washing liquid which has been used in the second prewashing unit, and, subsequently, washed in the second prewashing unit with fresh water or fresh aqueous solution by preferably a spraying or jetting technique. In an alternative way, the first and second prewashing units preferably have the configuration of a cascade system, whereby the wash liquid used for washing the precursor in the first and second prewashing unit are respectively present in a first and a second tank, and whereby the wash liquid of the second tank overflows to the first tank when fresh water or fresh aqueous solution is added in the second prewashing unit.<br><br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the prewashing station may comprise a first, a second and a third prewashing unit whereby the precursor is firstly washed in the first prewashing unit, subsequently in the second prewashing unit and finally in the third prewashing unit. The precursor can be firstly washed in the first prewashing unit with washing liquid which has been used in the second prewashing unit, subsequently washed in the second prewashing unit with washing liquid which has been used in the third prewashing unit, and finally washed in the third prewashing unit with fresh water or fresh aqueous solution by preferably a spraying or jetting technique. In an alternative way, the first, second and third prewashing units preferably have the configuration of a cascade system, whereby the wash liquids used for washing the precursor in the first, second and third prewashing unit are respectively present in a first, a second and a third tank, and whereby the wash liquid of the third tank overflows to the second tank when fresh water or fresh aqueous solution is added in the third prewashing unit and the wash liquid of the second tank overflows to the first tank.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the wash liquid used in each of the prewashing units may be also regenerated by removing insoluble material present in the wash liquid. The presence of insoluble material in the wash liquid may caused by several reasons, e.g. by washing of a pigment containing coating, by evaporation of solvent or water of the washing liquid, or by sedimentation, coagulation or flocculation of components in the wash liquid. The insoluble material can be removed by several techniques such as filtration, ultrafiltration, centrifugation or decantation. A suitable apparatus for disposing a waste solution such as the wash liquid of the present invention is described in EP-A 747 773. The apparatus can be connected to the tank of a prewashing unit to regenerate the used wash liquid by circulation of the wash liquid over a filter or a filter membrane. The wash liquid can be circulated over the filter or filter membrane continuously, periodically or during the washing time, or the circulation is regulated by the measurement of the turbidity or transparency (i.e. optical transmission) of the wash liquid whereby the circulation<br><br>
starts when the turbidity exceeds an upper value and stops when a under value is reached. The upper and under turbidity value can be chosen in relation to the desired degree of purification, generally the optical transmission of the wash liquid is not lower than 50% of its value at starting, preferably not lower than 80%, more preferably not lower than 95%.<br>
In the present invention, at least part of the toplayer can be removed in the washing step, preferably more than 50 % of the toplayer is removed, more preferably more than 80 %, most preferably more than 95 %. Preferably, the photopolymerizable layer is substantially not extracted or solubilized in the washing step whereby the wash liquid used in the washing step does not contain components of the photopolymerizable layer in a concentration of less than 2 % by weight of, more preferably less than than 1 % by weight of these ingredients of the potopolymerizable layer, most preferably less than 0.5 % by weight. The components of the photopolymerizable layer which are preferably as much as possible omitted in the wash liquid are polymerizable monomer, multifunctional monomer, initiator, inhibitor and/or sensitizer.<br>
Gum-processing<br>
After the heating step in the preheating unit or, when a washing step is present, after the washing step, the precursor is developed in a gumming station by applying a gum solution to the coating of the precursor, thereby removing the non-exposed areas of the photopolymerizable layer from the support and gumming the plate in a single step. The gumming station comprises at least one gumming unit wherein the gum is applied to the precursor by a spraying, jetting, dipping or coating technique or by rubbing in with an impregnated pad or by pouring-in, either by hand or in an automatic apparatus.<br>
An example of a spray nozzle which can be used in the spraying technique, is an air assisted spray nozzle of the type SUJl, commercially available at Spraying Systems Belgium, Brussels. The<br><br>
spray nozzle may be mounted on a distance of 50 mm to 200 mm between nozzle and receiving substrate.  The flow rate of the spray solution may be set to 7 ml/min.  During the spray process an air pressure in the range of 4.80x10^ Pa may be used on the spray head. This layer may be dried during the spraying process and/or after the spraying process. Typical examples of jet nozzles which can be used in the jetting technique, are ink-jet nozzles and valve-jet nozzles.<br>
At least one of the gumming units may be provided with at least one roller for rubbing and/or brushing the coating while applying the gum to the coating. The gum used in the developing step can be collected in a tank and the gum can be used several times. The gum can be replenished by adding a replenishing solution to the tank of the gumming unit. In an alternative way, the gum solution may be used once-only, i.e. only starting gum solution is applied to the coating by preferably a spraying or jetting technique. Said starting gum solution is a gum solution which has not been used before for developing a precursor and has the same composition as the gum solution used at the start of the development.<br>
Said replenishing solution is a solution which may be selected from a starting gum solution, a concentrated gum solution, a diluted gum solution, a solution of a non-ionic surfactant, water, a solution of a buffer having a pH ranging between 4 and 7 or a baking gum. A concentrated or diluted gum solution is a solution comprising a higher respectively lower concentration of gum additives as defined above. A concentrated gum solution can be added as replenishing solution when the concentration of active products is under a desired level in the gum solution. A diluted gum solution or water can be used when the concentration of active products is above a desired level in the gum solution or when the viscosity of the gum solution is increased or when the volume of the gum solution is under a desired level, e.g. due to evaporation of the solvent or water. A solution of a non-ionic surfactant or a solution of a buffer can be added when the gum solution needs a higher concentration of a surfactant or when the pH of the gum solution<br><br>
needs to be controlled at a desired pH value or at a desired pH value in a range of two pH values, e.g. between 4 and 7.<br>
The addition of replenishing solution, i.e. the type and the amount of replenishing solution, may be regulated by the measurement of at least one of the following parameters such as the number and area of plate precursor developed, the time period of developing, the volume in each gumming unit (minimum and maximum level), the viscosity (or viscosity increase) of the gum solution, the pH (or pH change) of the gum solution, the density (or density increase) of the gum solution and the conductivity (or conductivity increase) of the gum solution, or a.  combination of at least two of them. The density (or density increase) of the gum solution can be measured with a PAAR densitymeter.<br>
The gum solution used in this step has preferably a temperature ranging between 15°C and 85°C, more preferably between 18°C and 65°C, most preferably between 20°C and 55'C.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the gumming station comprises a first and a second gumming unit whereby the precursor is firstly developed in the first gumming unit and subsequently developed in the second gumming unit. The precursor may be firstly developed in the first gumming unit with gum solution which has been used in the second gumming unit, and, subsequently, developed in the second gumming unit with starting gum solution by preferably a spraying or jetting technique. In an alternative way, the first and second gumming unit preferably have the configuration of a cascade system, whereby the gum solution used for developing the precursor in the first and second gumming unit are respectively present in a first and a second tank, and whereby the gum solution of the second tank overflows to the first tank when replenishing solution is added in the second gumming unit. Optionally, also to the first gumming unit a replenishing solution can be added and this replenishing solution may be the same or another replenishing solution than added to the second gumming unit, e.g. a diluted gum solution, a solution of a non-ionic surfactant or water can be added as replenisher to the first gumming unit.<br><br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the gumming station comprises a first, a second and a third gumming unit whereby the precursor is firstly developed in the first gumming unit, subsequently in the second gumming unit and finally in the third gumming unit. The precursor may be firstly developed in the first gumming unit with gum solution which has been used in the second gumming unit, subsequently developed in the second gumming unit with gum solution which has been used in the third gumming unit, and finally developed in the third gumming unit with starting gum solution by preferably a spraying or jetting technique. In an alternative way, the first, second and third gumming unit preferably have the configuration of a cascade system, whereby the gum solution used for developing the precursor in the first, second and third gumming unit are respectively present in a first, a second and a third tank, and whereby the gum solution of the third tank overflows to the second tank when replenishing solution is added in the third gumming unit, and whereby the gum solution of the second tank overflows to the first tank. Optionally, also to the second and/or first gumming unit(s) a replenishing solution may be added and this replenishing solution may be the same or another replenishing solution than added to the third gumming unit, e.g. a diluted gum solution, a solution of a non-ionic surfactant or water can be added as replenisher to the second or first gumming unit. In another option, two different replenishing solutions can also be added to one gumming unit, e.g. a starting gum solution and water.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the gum solution used in each of the gumming units may be regenerated by removing of insoluble material present in the gum solution of a gumming unit. The presence of insoluble material in the gum solution may be caused by several reasons, e.g. by developing of a pigment containing coating, by evaporation of solvent or water of the gum solution, or by sedimentation, coagulation or flocculation of components in the gum solution. The insoluble material can be removed continueously or in batch form by several techniques such as filtration, ultrafiltration, centrifugation or decantation. A suitable apparatus for disposing a waste developing solution such as<br><br>
the gum solution of the present invention is described in EP-A 747 773. The apparatus can be connected to the tank of a gumming unit to regenerate the used gum solution by circulation of the gum solution over a filter or a filter membrane. The gum solution can be circulated over the filter or filter membrane continuously, periodically or during the development time, or the circulation is regulated by the measurement of the turbidity or transparency (i.e. optical transmission) of the gum solution whereby the circulation starts when the turbidity exceeds an upper value and stops when a under value is reached. The upper and under turbidity value can be chosen in relation to the desired degree of purification, generally the optical transmission of the gum solution is not lower than 50% of its value at starting, preferably not lower than 80%, more preferably not lower than 95%.<br>

Preparation of the printing plate<br>
2<br>
The precursor was imaged with an energy of 25 pJ/cm in a violet plate setter device Advantage DL3850 {Addressability : 1270 dpi) .<br>
A Pre-Heat was carried on in the pre-heat section of a VSP-85 (travel speed = 1.2 m/min., plate temperature = 110 °C). The time between the end of the exposure and the start of the preheat treatment was varied : 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60 minutes.<br>
After Pre-heat the printing plates were developed in the developing section of a VSP-85 in a Gum-1 solution at 2 5 °C at 1.2 m/min.)<br>
Gum-1 is a solution prepared as follow,-To 750 g demineralised water<br>
100 ml of Dowfax 3B2 (commercially available from Dow Chemical) 31.25 g 1,3-benzene disulphonic acid disodium salt (available from Riedel de Haan)<br>

added under stirring and demineralised water was further added<br>
to 1000 g.<br>
pH is between 7.2 and 7.8<br>
The printing plates were evaluated by inspecting the highlight rendering of a 110 Ipi raster. In table 4 the minimum % dots which were perfectly or almost perfectly visible on the printing plate are shown as a function of time between end of exposure and start of pre-heat (A time (min.))<br><br>
From table 4 it is clear that an increasing time between the end of the exposure and the start of the pre-heat (A time ) results in a decrease of the highlight rendering. When A time is between 0.5 and 5 minutes a 3 % dot pattern is still visible on the printing plate after processing. When A time amounts to 30 or 60 minutes the 3 % dot pattern (even the 4 and 5 % dot patterns) are no longer visible. ■<br><br><br><br>
