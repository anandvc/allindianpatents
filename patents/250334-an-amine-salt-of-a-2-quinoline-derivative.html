An injection preparation is intravenously administered alone or in combination with a conventional auxiliary solution such as a glucose solution, an amino acid solution and the like. Additionally, when necessary, the injection preparation is administered alone intramuscularly, intradermally, subcutaneously or intraperitoneally. Suppositories are endorectally administered. The present pharmaceutical preparations applicable for ophthalmological purpose may be administered by a method similar to those of conventional preparations, for example, ophthalmic ointments are administered on eyes. Ophthalmic solutions are administered by a method similar to those of conventional preparations, for example, 1 to 2 drops of an opnrhalmic solution is dropped in eyes from a suitable eye drop container, or an ophthalmic solution may be admini$tered in<br><br>
eyes by use of a spraying device.<br>
Dosage of the agent of the present invention may be suitably selected depending upon the method for administration, the age of patient, the distinctioh of sex, and other conditions, as well as the severity of diseases of the patient, and generally the agent of the invention may preferably contain 0.6 to 50 mg/kg of body weight/day of the carbostyril derivative (1) . Further 10 to 1000 mg of the active ingredient may be contained in the administrative unit form. The pharmaceutical preparations applicable for ophthalmological purpose, such as an ophthalmic solution or an ophthalmic ointment, are administered within a range of 1 to 15 times, preterably 1 to 10 times a day.<br>
The amine salts of carbostyril derivative of the present invention have a superior water solubility!, and are useful for the preparation in the form of a solution such as injections, ophthalmic solutions, oral solutions, enemas, gargles, ear drops, nasal drops, external liquid preparations and the like. Especially, they have some advantages such as being easy to keep the uniformity of content; not necessary to control the particle distribution; not necessary to add the suspending agent, dispersing agent and the like; easy to carry out the terminal sterilization by steam or the sterilisation bv<br><br>
filtration; etc. and thus the desired pharmaceutical products can be prepared industrially, simply and easily. Especially, the ophthalmic solutions of the invention have some advantages, for example, not to need the complicated re-dispersion like a suspension preparation, and good feelings in use such as good looks.
