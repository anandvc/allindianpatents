RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims priority from PCT application number<br>
PCT/IL01/00846, filed 6 September 2001, and titled "METHOD AND SYSTEM<br>
FOR PROVIDING TWO-WAY RADIO COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK<br>
TRANSMISSIONS OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL"<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method of implementing a two way like radio<br>
communication network between two or more users over an existing communication<br>
network and system therefor and relates in general to communications systems, and<br>
more particularly, to a system and method for packet-centric transmission of<br>
messages within and between two-way like radio communications systems<br>
implemented across wireless telephone networks using Internet Protocol.<br>
DISCUSSION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
A two-way radio communications network is a flexible, versatile and<br>
inexpensive tool for keeping in touch within an organization. A radio network is<br>
typically operative in connecting individuals spread out over a limited area, such<br>
as in construction work, in security coverage of public events, in television or<br>
movie productions, and the like. Two-way radio equipment can be established at<br>
a stationary location such as a central office, mounted in moving vehicles or built<br>
into battery-powered hand-portable units. In a two-frequency system, transmitters<br>
operate on one frequency, receivers on another. Accordingly, although mobile<br>
and portable units cannot talk to each other, the central operator monitors the<br>
users of the system. When the operator desires to call one or more field units the<br>
message reaches every radio unit that is switched on. Although typically the range<br><br><br>
of a two-way radio network is limited to a few miles, repeater systems can be<br>
utilized to receive signals from mobile and portable units and re-transmit them.<br>
As a result wider area coverage can be achieved. Wide area radio networks are<br>
often used by agencies, such as the military, the police, fire services and other<br>
emergency services, which can operate as separate users but also need the ability<br>
to use the same infrastructure. Various applications, such as local government,<br>
cargo fleets, and organization of large public events, can be assigned user groups<br>
within a radio system and be charged according to use. Radio networks are<br>
typically used by taxi companies, paramedic squads, police departments, and<br>
amateur radio operators. Campus environments such as manufacturing plants,<br>
transportation centers, universities and hospitals can also take advantage of on-<br>
site two-way radio by coordinating the activities of large groups of people within<br>
a limited area. Two-way radio technology provides unique benefits to the users,<br>
such as instant and direct connectivity via wireless voice communication, group<br>
calls and private calls without the necessity of setting up conference calls, and<br>
unit-to-unit communications.<br>
Alongside the advantages the current two-way radio networks, have a<br>
number of significant drawbacks. The establishment of a network has to be<br>
authorized by a third party. Tnus, to set up an operational network an organization<br>
has to apply via the regulating bodies for registration, authorization, frequency<br>
allocation, and operating license.<br>
Another disadvantage concerns the transmission range of such<br>
networks. The range of a typical radio network is limited for a few miles and the<br>
extension of the operational area involves significant expenses.<br>
Yet another disadvantage of the two-way radio networks concerns the<br>
number of available transmission channels. The number of channels is<br>
substantially limited to a range extending from 1 to 40. As the cost of the network<br>
is directly proportional to the number of utilized channels, in the majority of the<br>
radio networks the transmitting/receiving devices oprtsyr in the half-duplex<br>
mode.<br><br>
Still another serious disadvantage of the typical radio networks<br>
concerns the cost thereof. The mobile/fixed transmitting/receiving devices are<br>
typically unique for the type of the network and have to be purchased at a<br>
considerable expense.<br>
Yet another disadvantage of the two-way radio networks is that<br>
currently networks provide only narrow-band channels (typically voice-grade<br>
channels) that limit the information transmitted to voice only. Thus, no rich<br>
media, such as pictures, graphics, video, music, data, and the like can be<br>
transmitted.<br>
A further significant drawback of a two-way radio network concerns<br>
the lack of the roaming feature. Unlike a mobile subscriber of cellular<br>
communications network whom is automatically "handed off" between regional<br>
communication centers when traveling, a user of a two-way radio is limited to use<br>
a specific network operating in a specific area. In order to connect to a different<br>
network, complex procedures has to be taken such as specific dialing through the<br>
PSTN or through cellular networks where the connection is accomplished at a<br>
price.<br>
In would be easily understood by one with ordinary skills in the art<br>
that a need exists for an improved two-way radio network having advanced<br>
features. Specifically there is a need of an improved and advance radio network<br>
that will combine the above listed advantages of a conventional system with<br>
added and useful features, such as roaming capability, a substantially large<br>
number of communication channels, wider area coverage involving simplified<br>
operating procedures, and the transmission of information in rich media format,<br>
such as pictures, video, music, graphics, and text. Preferably the desired system<br>
should provide diverse advanced functions, such as e-mail connectivity, e-<br>
commerce applications, and other useful services provided routinely today by the<br>
sufficiently advanced communications networks.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
An improved two-way communications network that transmits over a<br>
 cellular communications network utilizing a packet-based protocol, such as the<br>
Internet Protocol (IP) or the X.25 protocol, is disclosed. In addition to the<br>
standard intra-network functions the improved like radio network provides<br>
advanced functions, such as sophisticated roaming services. The improved two-<br>
way like radio network enables the transmission of information across diverse<br>
 worldwide communications networks running packet-oriented protocols. Thus, a<br>
worldwide integration of two-way like radio communications networks is<br>
achieved. The information transmitted in the improved radio network is packet-<br>
based and capable of transmitting content in diverse formats such as voice,<br>
graphics, images, video, data, applications, and the like. The proposed system and<br>
 method also provides integrated data services including transmission of text<br>
messages, e-mail, data communication network access and the like. The roaming<br>
service is supported across communications networks that run under the General<br>
Packet Radio Service (GPRS) technology, which is based on Global System for<br>
Mobile (GSM) communication. The system and method proposed by the present<br>
 invention will be referred to in the text of this document as the Internet Protocol<br>
Radio Service (IPRS). Note should be taken that the name "IPRS" used only as a<br>
convenient labeling means and therefore not intended to be a suggested limitation<br>
on the system and method described in the following. The limits of the present<br>
invention would be defined in the following claims. In the context of the present<br>
 invention the like radio communications network or messages shall be referred to<br>
radio communications network or messages. The reference to radio is made in the<br>
context of the present invention and not specifically to traditional radio network.<br>
For the ease of understanding of the present invention the term radio is referred to<br>
and should not be construed narrowly.<br><br><br>
The IPRS network is an improved two-way radio network with<br>
substantially enhanced inter-radio-network connectivity options. A subscriber of<br>
the IPRS network operates a mobile or fixed radio device. A specifically<br>
developed client application operative in the implementation of the proposed<br>
 system and method is preferably installed in the radio device. The subscriber<br>
connects to an IPRS platform associated with a conventional wireless<br>
communications network, such as a cellular telephone network. The IPRS<br>
platform is a computing and communicating device having a users database and<br>
an IPRS process server installed thereon. In another preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention the IPRS platform does not include an IPRS server. Any server<br>
functionality which may be related to addressing is obtained from third party<br>
servers and otherwise no servers are required to make and use the invention. The<br>
users database includes a set of interconnected data structures storing specific<br>
information that defines the logical structure of one or more IPRS networks. The<br>
 information consists of, for example, a list of IPRS network users and the users-<br>
related functional information, such as address, status, group membership, quality<br>
of service data, and the like. The subscriber connects to the IPRS process server<br>
installed on the IPRS platform via an IP packet-oriented communications channel<br>
by submitting suitable requests to establish communication with one or more<br>
 users. The IPRS server may be a third party server to which the user send a query<br>
or through which the user sends a message to another user in order to first<br>
establish a connection. In the context of the present invention the term DPRS<br>
server shall also mean third party server or messaging server according to the<br>
context applied. The requested users could be operating the same IPRS network<br>
 or in any other local or remote IPRS networks. If the requested users are<br>
registered on the same IPRS server like the subscriber then the IPRS server<br>
establishes an appropriate radio link between the subscriber and the requested<br>
users by allocating a suitable communication channel across the same wireless<br>
communications network. When the users requested by the subscriber are<br>
 registered on a different IPRS server installed on a different IPRS platform<br><br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
An improved two-way communications network that transmits over a<br>
cellular communications network utilizing a packet-based protocol, such as the<br>
Internet Protocol (IP) or the X.25 protocol, is disclosed. In addition to the<br>
standard intra-network functions the improved like radio network provides <br>
advanced functions, such as sophisticated roaming services. The improved two-<br>
way like radio network enables the transmission of information across diverse<br>
worldwide communications networks running packet-oriented protocols. Thus, a<br>
worldwide integration of two-way like radio communications networks is<br>
achieved. The information transmitted in the improved radio network is packet- <br>
based and capable of transmitting content in diverse formats such as voice,<br>
graphics, images, video, data, applications, and the like. The proposed system and<br>
method also provides integrated data services including transmission of text<br>
messages, e-mail, data communication network access and the like. The roaming<br>
service is supported across communications networks that run under the General <br>
Packet Radio Service (GPRS) technology, which is based on Global System for<br>
Mobile (GSM) communication. The system and method proposed by the present<br>
invention will be referred to in the text of this document as the Internet Protocol<br>
Radio Service (IPRS). Note should be taken that the name "IPRS" used only as a<br>
convenient labeling means and therefore not intended to be a suggested limitation <br>
on the system and method described in the following. The limits of the present<br>
invention would be defined in the following claims. In the context of the present<br>
invention the like radio communications network or messages shall be referred to<br>
radio communications network or messages. The reference to radio is made in the<br>
context of the present invention and not specifically to traditional radio network. <br>
For the ease of understanding of the present invention the term radio is referred to<br>
and should not be construed narrowly.<br>
The IPRS network is an improved two-way radio network with<br>
substantially enhanced inter-radio-network connectivity options. A subscriber of<br>
the IPRS network operates a mobile or fixed radio device. A specifically <br><br><br><br>
are having the capability of translating the phone numbers of the clients to the<br>
their current IP number. According to such preferred embodiment the user<br>
initiating the call may contact the target user directly if the initiating user's<br>
cellular device includes the IP address for the target user's cellular device. If the<br>
 initiating user does not possess such an IP address he may send a message to the<br>
target user's cellular device with his own IP. This specific message will instruct<br>
the target user's cellular device to initiate an EPRS connection (based on IP) to the<br>
initiating user and the communication is completed as both initiating and target<br>
users' devices possesses each other IP addresses.<br><br>
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention the proposed<br>
system runs under the Real Time Transport Protocol/Real Time Control Protocol<br>
(RTP/RTCP). In other preferred embodiment of the invention other protocols can<br>
be used such as the Unix-based Visual Audio Tool (VAT), and the like. In the<br>
 preferred embodiment of the invention the wireless communications networks<br>
utilized as the underlying infrastructure for access, communication, and<br>
transmission by the proposed system and method are cellular telephone<br>
communications networks running under the GPRS service. In other preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention other pocket-centric transmission<br>
 technologies could be supported such as Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD),<br>
Wideband CDMA (WCDMA), and the like.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 1 showing a simplified block diagram of an<br>
exemplary IPRS system 10 that can be operative in the implementation of the<br>
 proposed system and method. System 10 includes users 12, 14, 16, a wireless<br>
communications network 24, and remote wireless networks 36, 38, and 40. The<br>
users 12, 14, 16 are subscribers of a two-way radio communications network<br>
designed and implemented according to the preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The suitable control information concerning the users 12, 14, 16 and<br>
 the radio network associated therewith is established on an IPRS computing and<br><br><br><br>
communications platform 28 within the wireless communications network 24.<br>
The users 12, 14, and 16 operate communication devices 18, 20, and 22,<br>
respectively. The communication devices 18, 20, 22 could be conventional<br>
mobile cellular devices, Personal Digital Assistants (PDA), personal computers<br>
 (PC) or any other mobile or stationary device with radio communication<br>
capabilities by haying suitable radio modem devices installed therein. The devices<br>
18, 20, and 22 also could be specifically modified T/R devices developed<br>
originally for use within two-way radio networks. In the preferred embodiment of<br>
the present invention the communications devices utilized are IPAQ pocket PCs<br>
 manufactured by the Compaq Corp, of Houston, Texas, U.S.A. In other preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention diverse other communications devices<br>
having basically the same necessary hardware options could be used, such as the<br>
Nokia 9210 manufactured by the Nokia Corp., of Keilalahdenti, Finland. The<br>
IPAQ device runs under the control of the Windows CE operating system while<br>
 the Nokia 9120 is run via the services of the Symbian operating system. The radio<br>
modems installed in the devices could be, for example, the Merlin ra3io modem<br>
manufactured by the Novatel Wireless Inc. of San Diego, California, U.S.A. The<br>
devices 18, 20, 22 are having the IPRS client application implemented therein to<br>
enable the users 12, 14, 16 to access and to communicate with the desired users<br>
 associated with the same radio network, or with the remote radio networks. The<br>
IPRS client application (not shown) includes signaling functions, transport<br>
functions, and a user interface. The operation of the IPRS client application will<br>
be described hereunder in association with the following drawings. It would be<br>
obvious that although only three subscriber devices are shown on the discussed<br>
 drawing in a realistically configured environment a plurality of subscriber devices<br>
could operate within a given radio network. It would be also obvious that the<br>
subscribers 12, 14, and 16 could be associated each with a different IPRS network<br>
or could be the members of the same IPRS network.<br><br><br><br>
Still referring to Fig. 1 the wireless communications network 24<br>
includes a radio antenna device 26, an IPRS platform 28, and a gateway device<br>
34. The antenna 26 is operative in receiving and transmitting RF signals<br>
transmitted and received by the subscriber devices 18,20, and 22. The antenna 26<br>
 is linked to the IPRS platform 28 either via a hard cable or via a radio link. The<br>
platform 28 is a computing and communicating device having a memory device<br>
(not shown) that stores a users database 28, and an IPRS process server 32. The<br>
server 32 includes a Multi-point Conference Module (MC) 29, and a Media<br>
Processor module (MP) 31 Note should be taken that only those elements<br>
 implemented in the IPRS platform 28 are shown that are essential to a ready<br>
understanding of the present invention. In a realistic configuration the platform 28<br>
could include a plurality of hardware and software devices essential to the proper<br>
operation thereof. Although only a single IPRS platform 28 is shown on the<br>
drawing described it would be obvious that in a practical configuration several<br>
 IPRS platforms could be associated with a single wireless communications<br>
network in order to allow for load balancing among the different platforms.<br>
Further it is conceivable that a single IPRS platform could be associated with<br>
several wireless communications networks. The currently discussed drawing<br>
shows a configuration in which the users database 30 and the IPRS process server<br>
32 are co-located on the same computing and communications platform 28. In<br>
other possible arrangements the database 30 and the server 32 could be<br>
implemented on different devices. The drawing further shows that the MP 29 and<br>
the MC 31 are co-located on the same platform 28. In other conceivable<br>
configurations the MC 31 and the MP 29 could be implemented on different<br>
platforms in order to allow for the optimal sharing of the workload. Thus, an MC<br>
31 could activate simultaneously several MP 29 co-located on the same<br>
computing platform with the MC 31 and with each other MPs or installed on<br>
different computing platforms. The activation of the several MP 29 could be<br>
controlled by a load-balancing server device. Users database 26 is a set of data<br>
 structures storing information concerning operative IPRS networks, IPRS sub-<br><br><br>
networks such as groups of users, and the list of users associated with the<br>
networks or with the groups of users. The information could include various<br>
functional data such as user identification, a user status and the like. A more<br>
detailed description of the users database will be set forth hereunder in<br>
 association with the following drawings. The IPRS server 32 is a set of computer<br>
programs specifically developed for the operation of the EPRS system and<br>
method. The server 32 is operative in accepting subscribers' request for access<br>
and connection, to allocate communication channels, for connecting users, for<br>
accessing remote wireless communications networks, and the like. The server 32<br>
 includes functional modules such as the MC 31 and the MP 29. The MC 31 is<br>
responsible for the signaling functions of the IPRS server while the MP 29<br>
handles the data transport. If a connection request is put through by a subscriber<br>
desiring to communicate with a user linked to a remote wireless communications<br>
network the server 32 identifies the destination network and instructs the gateway<br>
 server 34 to connect to the said remote network. The gateway 34 is a computing<br>
and communication device operative in connecting different communications<br>
networks and translating the information content to the format suitable to the<br>
destination network. The wireless network 24 could include more man one<br>
gateway devices. Wireless networks 36, 38, and 40 are communications networks<br>
utilizing the GPRS service or any other packet-oriented technology. The remote<br>
networks 36, 38, 40 include remote IPRS servers (not shown) of their own,<br>
having a structure and functionality similar to the structure and functionality of<br>
server 32. The gateway device 34 communicates with the remote IPRS servers in<br>
order to transmit the subscriber request for communication with the users defined<br>
therein. The remote IPRS servers are operative for creating the communication<br>
path between the requestor and the requested parties. It would be obvious that<br>
although only three remote networks are shown on the discussed drawing in a<br>
practical communications environment a plurality of remote networks could be<br>
connectable through a plurality of gateway devices in order to provide<br>
 communication channels between a plurality of users.<br><br><br><br>
Fig. 2 shows the operative components constituting the IPRS server<br>
application 26 of Fig. 1 in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The IPRS server 101 may consists of a set of specifically developed<br>
 software routines stored on the memory device of the IPRS platform 28 of Fig. 1.<br>
The IPRS server 101 may also consists of one or more hardware devices such as<br>
pre-manufactured integrated circuits or application specific integrated circuits<br>
(ASIC) storing a suitable set of built-in machine code instructions functional to<br>
the operation of the application. Server 101 includes a flow and call control<br>
 component 102, an online registration component 104, a provisioning component<br>
106, a billing component 108, a configuration component 110, a transport handler<br>
112, a roaming handler 114, a routing handler 116, a voice coder transformer 118,<br>
a group update handler 120, and a management module 119. The main<br>
components essential to the operation of the proposed system and method of the<br>
present invention are; a multi-point conference (MC) module 122, and a Media<br>
Processor Module (MP) 121. The flow and call control component 102 is the<br>
main control module of the application. The online registration component<br>
communicates with the users desiring to register with the system, terminates<br>
existing connections where required, and updates the relevant status flags in the<br>
users database. The provisioning component 106 provides customer services, logs<br>
transactions, allocates resources, and typically operative in setting up services<br>
required by the users. The functionality of the billing component 108 is to provide<br>
billing services to the system and to handle the various network-specific or user-<br>
specific billing methods (pay-per-session, flat rate, and the like). The<br>
configuration component 110 allows for the configuration of the system, such as<br>
modifying addresses, user identifications, setting up new radio networks, and the<br>
like. The transport handler 112 is responsible for the transmission of the data<br>
within the network, the roaming handler 116 controls the channeling of the<br>
incoming requests to the suitable networks and accepts and handles the requests<br>
of the users associated with remote networks. The voice-coder transformer 118<br><br><br><br>
converts analog speech signals to digital data and via a speech synthesizer<br>
converts digital data to artificial speech sounds. The group update handler 120<br>
provides the capability of modifying common group-related parameters of the<br>
users. The management module 119 provides the capability to the operators of the<br>
 IPRS application, to upgrade, to maintain, and to control the operation of the<br>
server such as allowing system configuration, database backup/restore, system<br>
generation, control table update, and the like.<br>
The multi-point conference (MC) module 122 receives, processes, and<br>
 forwards the signaling messages between the users of the proposed system. MC<br>
module 122 is also operative in instructing the MP module 121 to start a transport<br>
session. The MP module 121 is operative in the transfer of the data between the<br>
various communicating parties and in transcoding the messages among the<br>
different coders/decoders. In other preferred embodiments of the present<br>
 invention various useful modules could be added to further improve the operation<br>
of the proposed system and method and adding supplementary functions.<br>
Fig. 3 is a simplified block diagram showing the operative components<br>
of the IPRS client application 652. The client application 652 may be a set of<br>
software routines specifically developed and stored on the memory device of the<br>
subscriber device such as a mobile radio. The application 652 may also be one or<br>
more hardware devices such as pre-manufactured integrated circuits of<br>
application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) installed on the mobile/fixed radio<br>
device and having a set of suitable built in machine code instructions operative in<br>
the performance of the application 652. The application 652 includes an RTP<br>
module 654, a coder/decoder 656, a signaling module 658, a phone to IP address<br>
translator module 657, and a user interface module 659. The RTP module 654 is<br>
operative in the running of the Internet Standard Real Time Protocol for the<br>
transport of real-time data including audio and video. The RTP is typically used<br>
 for specific services such as Internet telephony. The coder/decoder (codec)<br><br><br><br>
module is responsible for the encoding and decoding of the radio signals.<br>
Typically different communications networks, using different communications<br>
technologies, implement technology-specific coder/decoder modules. For<br>
example in the GSM networks a GSM coder/decoder is implemented, while in the<br>
 PCS networks a specific PCS coder/decoder is used. The EPRS server provides<br>
transcoding services between the various codecs. Thus, when a user from a GSM-<br>
based communications network communicates with a user in a PCS network the<br>
appropriate transcoding from the GSM coding/decoding to the PCS<br>
coding/decoding technologies is achieved through a suitable routine of the IPRS<br>
server. The signaling module 658 is responsible for transmitting requests and<br>
associated parameters between the devices or applications to deliver a service<br>
request across the networks. The phone to IP address translator module 657 is<br>
used when a client communicates without an IPRS server. The module 657 is<br>
responsible for connecting the client to a non-IPRS network entity in order to<br>
 translate a phone number to a valid IP number. The user interface module 659<br>
provides the user of the mobile/fixed radio device with the capability of operating<br>
the radio device by receiving and processing the signals delivered from the input<br>
devices and input controls such as a pushbuttons, or a microphone installed on the<br>
radio device and delivering the incoming messages the output devices such as a<br>
 speaker or a display screen.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 4 that shows an exemplary structure of the<br>
proposed system and method in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention. The system includes a wireless operator network 252 linked to<br>
a router device 254. The operator network 252 could be a cellular telephone<br>
network. The router device 254 could be a part of the operator network 252 or<br>
could be located in a different communications network. The router device 254 is<br>
linked to a set of IPRS platforms 265, 269, 271. The IPRS platforms 265, 269,<br>
271 include MC devices 258, 260, and 262, respectively. The MC 258, 260 and<br>
 262 are associated with different radio networks. The MC 258,260, 262 could be<br><br><br><br>
installed on separate computing platforms or could be co-located on the same<br>
platform. The MC 258 controls MP 264 and 266. The MC 260 controls MP 268,<br>
and 270. The MC 262 controls MP 272, 274, and 276. In the proposed system and<br>
method the signaling channels are handled by the MC 258, 260, 262 while the<br>
RTP channels and the voice/data channels are handled by the MP 264, 266, 268,<br>
270, 272, 274, and 276.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 5, which is a simplified block diagram of the<br>
hierarchical configuration of the proposed system, in accordance with the<br>
 preferred embodiment of the present invention. The system proposed could be<br>
distributed and could span the globe. A communication server 41 controls and<br>
coordinates the operation of the various servers 42 associated with a specific<br>
country or geographical region. The servers 42 control and coordinate the<br>
operation of the different telephony application provider servers 43. The servers<br>
43 are typically configured and provided with the functionality of the server 26 of<br>
Fig. 1. The server 43 are operative in controlling and coordinating the operation<br>
of the various organizations having an associated two-way radio network<br>
operational and defined on the servers 43 or on the servers of the organizations.<br>
The users 45 are associated with a specific organization 44 and operative<br>
information concerning the users is established on the telephony application<br>
server 43 in association with the information concerning the radio networks of the<br>
organizations 44 or on the servers of the organizations 44.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 6 showing a simplified block diagram<br>
 illustrating an exemplary set of elements organized in a hierarchical manner that<br>
are associated with the proposed system and method in accordance with a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention. Communication center 46<br>
controls and coordinates the operation of the regional servers 48, and 47 located<br>
in or are associated with the USA and the UK, respectively. The regional server<br>
 48 that is located or associated with the USA region is operative in controlling<br><br><br><br>
and coordinating the operation of the telephony application provider 50. The<br>
application provider 50 for example is the AT&amp;T Company, One or more IPRS<br>
server s of the provider 50 control and coordinate the communications of the<br>
organizations 52. The organization 52 is for example Lucent Inc, and Cisco Inc.,<br>
 respectively The Lucent organization 54 includes the associated users 60, 61 that<br>
operate within the radio network of the organization 54. The Cisco organization<br>
56 includes the associated users 59, 52 that are subscribers in the radio network<br>
controlled by the organization 56. Similarly the regional server 47 that is located<br>
or associated with the UK region is operative in controlling and coordinating the<br>
operation of the telephony application provider 49. The application provider 49<br>
for example is the Vodafone Corp. of Manchester, UK.. One or more IPRS<br>
servers of the provider 49 control and coordinate the communications of the<br>
organizations 51, and 53. The organizations 51, and 55 are for example the UPS<br>
Inc. and the Ford Company, respectively. The UPS organization 51 provides<br>
communications capabilities to the associated users 57, 58, while the Ford<br>
organization provides communication services to a user 55. It will be obvious that<br>
in contrast to the simplified block diagram shown on the discussed drawing in a<br>
realistic environment a plurality of application providers could be controlling a<br>
plurality of networks operative in providing communications services to a<br>
 plurality of users therein.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 7 that illustrates the user registration process via a<br>
simplified flow chart, in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention. When a subscriber activates the IPRS client application implemented<br>
in the user radio device the activation can be made in two differing modes: a) the<br>
radio device is activated in the radio network the subscriber is associated with b)<br>
the radio device is activated in the roaming mode. When the radio device is<br>
activated in the local radio network the device receives an IP address stored<br>
within the radio device of the IPRS server storing the radio network information.<br>
 Subsequently, the IPRS client application initiates a connection to the IPRS<br><br><br><br>
server via an IP-packet channel in accordance with the stored IP address. At step<br>
62 the IPRS client obtains the EPRS server address and additional data. The<br>
address is an IP address obtained from a Domain Name Server (DNS). The<br>
additional data could the port number of the IPRS server, optionally a private key<br>
 for encryption, the user identification, and the user password. The IPRS client<br>
transmits a registration message to the IPRS server at step 63. The registration<br>
message is accompanied by other data such as the optional private key, the user<br>
identification, the password, and the like. At step 64 it is determined whether the<br>
server accepts the connection from the client If the server does not accept the<br>
connection following the recognition of an unauthorized access attempt, errors in<br>
the identification, or any other relevant reason then at step 65 the server rejects<br>
the connection and at step 66 a suitable notification message, such as a "denied"<br>
message, is sent to the client concerning the reason for the denial of the<br>
registration. Optionally the server redirects the client to an alternative server to<br>
enable an additional attempt of registration (step 67). The "denied" message<br>
includes an appropriate error code and a detailed text to be displayed to the<br>
initiating user. In contrast, if at step 64 it is determined that the server accepts the<br>
connection then at step 70 a message acknowledging registration is sent by the<br>
server to the client. At step 71 the server sets the status of the user record stored<br>
in the users database to "online". Optionally at step 68 the server checks the<br>
available channel bandwidth and at step 69 the server optionally redirects the<br>
client to an alternative server to provide for the allocation of a channel with<br>
sufficient bandwidth.<br>
The registration process establishes a connection between the IPRS<br>
client and the IPRS server. The connection can be terminated by the server as a<br>
result of the timing out of a timer device or the connection can be terminated by<br>
the client. Referring now to Fig. 8 that illustrates the termination of the<br>
connection between the client and the server via a simplified flowchart in<br>
 accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. At step 74 the<br><br><br>
client sends a termination message to the server. At step 76 the server receives<br>
and accepts the termination message. At step 78 the client is notified concerning<br>
the termination of the connection.<br>
Fig. 9A shows the initiation of a connection from to a client to a<br>
specific user. At step 80 the client application obtains the list of users with the<br>
"online" status from the user's database 30 of Fig. 1. The client could also use an<br>
internal address book with a list of stored users. In this case some of the users<br>
may not be online. At step 82 the clients selects a user to communicate with and<br>
at step 84 the client transmits an invitation or "join" message to the server with<br>
relevant data 88, such as the user identification, user IP, port, coder/decoder<br>
routine, and the identification of the requested user. The requested user will be<br>
referred to as DES-user in the following text At step 86 the client waits for and<br>
accepts a :"new session" message from the server. The message is received with<br>
relevant control data 90 such as DES-user IP address, DES-user identification,<br>
port, and coder/decoder routine name.<br>
Fig. 9B illustrates graphically the conceptual path of the messages<br>
involved the above described process. User 1 (92) transmits an invitation ("join")<br>
message 98 to the server 94. The server 94 checks the status of the user 2 (96) and ,<br>
transmits an invitation ("join") message 98 to the server 94. The server 94 checks<br>
the status of user 2 (96) and sends a new session message 100 to user 2 (96) and<br>
another new session message 100 user 2 (96) an another new session message<br>
(98) to user 1 (92). Both users reply by sending an acknowledgement message to<br>
 the server 94.<br>
Fig. 9C shows the initiation of a connection from a client to a<br>
specific user. At step 702 the client application obtains the list of users from the<br>
client internal address book or allow the user to type a user identification<br>
manually. At step 704 the clients selects a user to communicate with and at step<br><br><br><br>
706 the client resolves the destination client IP address. Such resolving can be<br>
accomplished by looking up the destination client IP address in the user's client<br>
internal address book or within the user's client phone. Alternatively the<br>
destination client IP resolving can be accomplished by accessing a non IPRS<br>
 server which is part of the cellular network. At step 708 the client transmits an<br>
"invitation" message to the destination client (The requested destination will be<br>
referred to as DES-client in the following text) with relevant data 710 or with<br>
relevant data 711, such as the user identification, user IP or user telephone<br>
number, port, coder/decoder routine, and the identification of the requested user.<br>
When the destination user's IP address is known, the invitation may be<br>
accomplished via direct link to the destination user. The requested user will be<br>
referred to as DES-user in the following text. At step 714 the client waits for and<br>
accepts an acknowledgement message from the DES-client. The message is<br>
received with relevant control data 712 such as DES-user IP address, DES-user<br>
identification, port, and coder/decoder routine name. In an alternative mode when<br>
the DBS-user's IP address is not known the DES-user's telephone number is used<br>
to send the DES-user a message (for example through an SMS or the like or<br>
through any other service). Such message includes the client's IP address. When<br>
the DES-user receives the particular message with the client IP address the DES-<br>
user initiates a connection with the client. The client may receive an<br>
acknowledgment 714 with information 712 (which includes the IP of the DES-<br>
user) directly or a full connection may be established by the DES-user with the<br>
information 712.<br>
Fig. 9D illustrates graphically the conceptual path of the messages<br>
involved the above described process. User 1 (972) transmits an "IP resolution<br>
request" message 978 to the non-IPRS server 974. The server 974 replies by "IP<br>
resolution response" message 980 to user 1 (972). User 1 (972) transmits an<br>
invitation ("join") message 982 to user 2 (976). User 2 (976) replies by sending a<br><br><br><br>
"new session" message 984 to user 1 (972). Consequently an RTP session 986<br>
can be started between user 1 (972) and user 2 (976).<br>
Fig 10A is a simplified flowchart that illustrates the process of<br>
 invitation ("join") communication from a specific user to another user where both<br>
users are associated with the same radio network and the same IPRS server. At<br>
step 124 the MC module 122 of Fig. 2 translates the user 1 (initiating user)<br>
identification to the user 1 IP address. At step 126 the MC sends a session<br>
initiation ("new message") message with the user 1-related data to the user 2<br>
(requested user). At step 128 the MC sends a session initiation ("new session")<br>
message with the user 2-related data to the user 1 (initiating user). At step 130 the<br>
MC receives acknowledgment message from user 2 with the relevant control data.<br>
At step 132 the MC receives acknowledgment message from the user 1 with the<br>
control data. At step 134 the user 1 and user 2 status flags in the users database is<br>
 set to "busy".<br>
Fig. 10B illustrates graphically the conceptual path of the messages<br>
involved the above described process. User 1 (140) transmits an invitation<br>
message ("join") 146 to the MC module 142. The MC 142 sends a session<br>
initiation ("new session") message 148 to the user 2 (144) and simultaneously<br>
sends a session initiation ("new session") message 150 to user 1 (140). User 2<br>
(144) replies to the session initiation message by sending an acknowledgement<br>
message 156 to the MC 142 and user 1 (140) replies to the session initiation<br>
message by sending an acknowledgement message 1S2 to the MC 142.<br>
Consequently an RTP session 158 can be started between user 1 (140) and user 2<br>
(144) directly between the two users or via the MC 142.<br>
Fig. 11A illustrates graphically the conceptual path of the messages<br>
involved the initiation of a communication between two users associated with the<br>
 same radio network but listed in different IPRS servers in a first mode of an<br><br><br>
operation. In the first mode of the operation the IPRS servers of the same network<br>
communicate via the multi-point conference module of a higher-level IPRS server<br>
referred to as the Multi-point Conference Controller (MCC). User 1 (160)<br>
transmits an invitation ("join") message (170) to the MCI module 162. The MCI<br>
 (162) forwards the invitation message 172 to the MCC 164. The MCC 164 is an<br>
MC module implemented in a higher-level IPRS server that controls and<br>
coordinates the operation of the lower level IPRS servers. The MCC 164 forwards<br>
the invitation message 174 to an MC2 module (166) implemented in the IPRS<br>
server of the remote wireless network. The MC2 (166) sends session initiation<br>
("new session") message 176 to the user 2 (168). The MC2 (166) also sends a<br>
session initiation ("new session") message 180 to the MCC (164). The MCC<br>
forwards 182 the message to the MCI (162), which forwards 184 it to the user 1<br>
(160). User 2 (168) replies to the session initiation message by sending an<br>
acknowledgement message 178 to the MC2 (166), User 1 (160) replies to the<br>
session initiation message by sending an acknowledgement message 186 to the<br>
MCI (162). More acknowledgement messages may be forwarded between the<br>
MCs (not shown). Consequently an RTP session 186 can start between the user 1<br>
(160) and the user 2 (168).<br>
Fig. 11B illustrates graphically the conceptual path of the<br>
messages involved the initiation of a communication between two users<br>
associated with the same IPRS network but listed in different IPRS servers,<br>
according to the second mode of operation. In the second mode of the operation<br>
the communication between the IPRS servers of the different networks is<br>
accomplished by a specific "location" function. Thus, user 1 (160) transmits an<br>
invitation ("join") message 188 to the MCI module 162. The MCI (162)<br>
interrogates 190 the MCC 164 concerning the address of the MC2 (166). The<br>
MCC 164 provides 191 the address of the MC2 (166) to the MCI (162) that<br>
consequently forwards the invitation ("join") message 192 directly to the MC2<br>
 (166). The MC2 (166) sends session initiation ("new session") message 194 to<br><br><br>
the user 2 (168). The MC2 (166) also sends a session initiation ("new session")<br>
message 198 to the MCI (162), which forwards 200 it to the user 1 (160). User 2<br>
(168) replies to the session initiation message by sending an acknowledgement<br>
message 196 to the MC2 (166), User 1 (160) replies to the session initiation<br>
 message by sending an acknowledgement message 202 to the MCI (162). More<br>
acknowledgement messages may be forwarded between the MCs (not shown).<br>
Consequently an RTP session 186 can be started between the user 1 (160) and the<br>
user 2 (168).<br>
Fig. 12A illustrates graphically the conceptual path of the messages<br>
involved the initiation of a communication between two users associated with two<br>
different IPRS networks and listed in two different IPRS servers. In the first mode<br>
of the operation the communication between the IPRS servers of the different<br>
IPRS networks is accomplished via the high-level multi-point conference module<br>
MCC. Thus, user 1 (160) transmits an invitation ('join") message 202 to the MCI<br>
module (162). The MCI (162) forwards the invitation message 204 to the MCC<br>
164. The MCC 164 forwards the invitation message 206 to the MC2 (166). The<br>
MC2 (166) sends session initiation ("new session") message 208 to the user 2<br>
(168). The MC2 (166) also sends a session initiation ("new session") message<br>
604 to the MCC (164). The MCC forwards 606 the message to the MCI (162),<br>
which forwards 608 it to the user 1 (160). User 2 (168) replies to the session<br>
initiation message by sending an acknowledgement message 219 to the MC2<br>
(166), User 1 (160) replies to the session initiation message by sending an<br>
acknowledgement message 609 to the MCI (162). More acknowledgement<br>
messages may be forwarded between the MCs (not shown). Consequently an RTP<br>
session can be started between user 1 (160) and user 2 (168) via the MCI (162),<br>
the MCC 164, and the MC2 (166). The user 1 (160) communicates data 610 to the<br>
MCI (162). The MCI (162) forwards 612 the data to the MCC (164), which in<br>
turn forwards 614 the data to MC2 (166). The MC2 (166) transmits 618 the data<br>
 to the user 2 (168). The return path of communication from the user 2 (166) via<br><br><br>
MC2 (166), the MCC 164, the MCI (162) to the user 1 (160) shown as 619, 620,<br>
622, and 624 respectively.<br>
Fig. 12B illustrates graphically the conceptual path of the<br>
messages involved the initiation of a communication between two users<br>
associated with two different radio networks and listed in two different IPRS<br>
servers. In the second mode of the operation the communication between the<br>
IPRS servers of the different networks is accomplished via the specific "locate"<br>
function. Thus, user 1 (160) transmits an invitation ("join") message 210 to the<br>
MCI module (162). The MCI (162) interrogates 212 the MCC 164 in regard to<br>
the address of the MC2 (166) and subsequent to the received address 214<br>
forwards 216 the invitation message 212 directly to the MC2 (166). The MC2<br>
(166) sends session initiation ("new session") message 218 to the user 2 (168).<br>
The MC2 (166) also sends a session initiation ("new session") message 220 to<br>
the MCI (162), which forwards 222 it to the user 1 (160). User 2 (168) replies to<br>
the session initiation message by sending an acknowledgement message 224 to<br>
the MC2 (166), User 1 (160) replies to the session initiation message by sending<br>
an acknowledgement message 226 to the MCI (162). More acknowledgement<br>
messages may be forwarded between the MCs (not shown). Consequently an<br>
RTP session can be started between user 1 (160) and user 2 (168) via the MCI<br>
(162) and the MC2 (166). The user 1 (160) communicates data 710 to the MCI<br>
(162). The MCI (162) forwards 712 the data to the MC2 (166). The MC2 (166)<br>
transmits 714 the data to the user 2 (168). The return path of communication from<br>
the user 2 (166) via MC2 (166), the MCI (162) to the user 1 (160) is shown as<br>
 716, 718, and 720 respectively.<br>
Fig. 13A illustrates graphically the conceptual path of the messages<br>
involved the initiation of a unicast-simulating-multicast communication session<br>
between a single user and either a specific group of users or a set of N targeted<br>
 users within a single IPRS network and listed in a single IPRS server. User 1<br><br><br>
(216) sends an invitation ("join") message 226 to the MC 218. The data with the<br>
message includes data concerning either a specific group of users or a set of<br>
individual users. The data includes addresses referring either to the group of users<br>
or to the set of the N users that user 1 (216) is desired to communicate with in the<br>
framework of a single session. Thus, the MC 218 processes the invitation<br>
message 226 and as a result the MC 218 forwards N-l identical session initiation<br>
("new session") messages with suitable addresses and data 228, 230, and 232 to<br>
user 2 (220), user 3 (222), and to user N (224), respectively. The MC 218 also<br>
sends a session initiation ("new session") message 227 to user 1 (216).<br>
Optionally user 1 (216) returns acknowledgement message 229. Optionally each<br>
of the N-l users replies with an acknowledgment message to the MC 218. User 2<br>
(220) returns acknowledgement message 234, user 3 (222) returns<br>
acknowledgement message 236, and user N (224) returns acknowledgement<br>
message 238. Optionally the MC 218 processes the entire set of received<br>
acknowledgement messages and forwards a suitable set of acknowledgment<br>
messages 240 back to user 1 (216). Note should be taken that the set of the<br>
messages 242 includes only received acknowledgements. If, for example, user 3<br>
(222) does not replies then the set of the messages 240 will include messages<br>
from the user 2 (220) and the user N (224) only. Consequently user 1 (216)<br>
initiates an RTP session and transmits a set of suitable data messages 242 to MC<br>
218. The MC 218 processes the set of data messages and forwards N-l resulting<br>
messages 244, 246, and 248 to the N targeted users 220, 222, 224, respectively.<br>
Consequentially an answering data message 2S0 from one of the users, say user N<br>
224 is received by the MC 218 that in turn processes the answering message and<br>
forwards N resulting messages 252, 254, and 256 to the N targeted users 216,<br>
220, 222.<br>
Fig. 13B illustrates graphically the conceptual path of the messages<br>
involved the initiation of a unicast-simulating-multicast communication session<br>
 between a single user and a set of N targeted users within a single IPRS network.<br><br><br><br>
User 1 (936) transmits an "IP resolution request" message 932 to the non-IPRS<br>
server 946 with request to resolves the addresses of users 2 to user N. The server<br>
946 replies by "IP resolution response" message 934 to user 1 (936). User 1 (936)<br>
sends N-l identical invitation ("join") messages with suitable addresses and data<br>
938, 940, and 942 to user 2 (956), user 3 (958), and to user N (952), respectively.<br>
Each of the N-l users replies with a "new session" message to user 1 (936). User<br>
2 (956) returns "new session" message 948, user 3 (958) returns "new session"<br>
message 950, and user N (952) returns "new session" message 954 .Optionally,<br>
userl returns N-l acknowledgement messages to user 2 up to user N (not shown).<br>
Consequently user 1 (936) initiates an RTP session and transmits a set of N-<br>
lmessages 960, 962, and 964 to the N-l targeted users 956, 958 and 952,<br>
respectively. Consequentially a specific answering data messages 966, 968, or<br>
970 from one of the users, say user N 952 is transmitted to the N-l targeted users<br>
936, 956, and 958, respectively.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 14 illustrating the functionality of the MC<br>
module via a simplified flowchart of the user session initiation process performed<br>
by the MC module, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention. At step 303 the MC receives an invitation message from an IPRS client<br>
concerning the opening of a channel to a DES-user. The invitation message<br>
includes important control information 302, such as device identification, user<br>
identification, user password, IP, and the like. At step 304 the MC accesses the<br>
users database in order to check for the existence of the DES-user in the database.<br>
At step 305 it is determined whether the user is defined in the user database. If the<br>
result is negative then at step 314 the MC sends a "denied" message with attached<br>
error code to the IPRS client device, which initiated the connection. Optionally,<br>
the MC could redirect the IPRS client to an alternative IPRS registration server..<br>
If at step 305 it is determined that the DES-user is listed in the users database then<br>
at step 315 the MC sends a "new Session" message with attached client address<br>
 and identification data to the DES-user. At step 308 the MC sends a "new<br><br><br>
Session" message with attached DES-user address and identification data to the<br>
client device. At step 316 the DES-user acknowledges the "New Session"<br>
message and at step 310 the client acknowledges the "New Session" message. At<br>
step 312 the MC instructs the users database to set the initiating client device and<br>
the DES-user device statuses to "busy". The MC is further operative in the<br>
activation of a timer device. The timer is active as long as the communications<br>
channel between the IPRS clients is active. When the channel is idle after a period<br>
having a predefined length the connection is torn down.<br>
Fig. 15 shows a simplified flow chart that illustrates the operation of<br>
the MC in the setting up of an RTP session to be utilized for the transmission of<br>
voice/data stream between an initiating IPRS client and either a requested user<br>
(DES-user) or a specific group of requested users referred to as the DES-group.<br>
The MC provides the option of handling and processing of a plurality of RTP<br>
sessions initiated by a plurality of clients substantially simultaneously. The<br>
initiating user sends an invitation ("join") message designed to effect the start of<br>
an RTP session. The message includes important operative data 350, such as user<br>
identification, user IP, port number, coder/decoder module name, DES-user<br>
identification, DES-group, and the like. At step 352 the MC accesses the users<br>
database in order to obtain the IP addresses of the users with the "online" status.<br>
At step 354 the MC instructs the MP to allocate resources for the RTP session. At<br>
step 356 the MC connects to the MP and obtains resources for the RTP session..<br>
At step 356 the MC sends "New Session" messages to all the DES-users or DES-<br>
groups and client participating in the session. The messages include important<br>
operational data such as MP IP, MP port number, coder/decoder module name,<br>
and the like. At step 358 the MC receives acknowledgement messages from the<br>
entire set of participating DES-users or DES-groups and client where the<br>
messages include address and identification data. At step 362 the MC receives an<br>
RTP session start message from the MP. At step 364 the session timer is activated<br>
in order to disconnect the session after a predefined number of seconds if the<br><br><br>
communications channel is idle. At step 366 it is checked whether the session<br>
timer had timed out. If the timer is timed out then at step 374 the MC instructs the<br>
MP to free the resources allocated for the session. As long as the timer is running<br>
the MC waits for new invitation ("join") messages (step 368). At step 370 the MC<br>
receives an invitation message and consequently sends an "New Session"<br>
message including the MP IP, port number, coder/decoder module name, and the<br>
like (step 372). Subsequently program control proceeds to step 362 and a program<br>
loop is activated across steps 362 through 374. The loop is executed repeatedly<br>
during the timer's active period.<br>
Fig. 16 illustrates graphically the conceptual path of the messages<br>
involved in the communication between two groups of users associated with two<br>
different IPRS networks and listed in two different IPRS servers. User 1 (400)<br>
transmits an invitation ("join) message 410 to the MCI module 402. The MCI<br>
(402) sends a session initiation ("new session") messages 412 and 413 to the user<br>
2 (218) and to the user 1 (400) respectively. The MCI (402) also forwards the<br>
invitation message 414 to the MC2 (404). The MC2 (404) sends session initiation<br>
("new session") messages 416 and 418 to the user 3 (406) and to the user 4 (408),<br>
respectively. The user 2 (218) and the user 1 (400) respond by returning<br>
acknowledgement messages 413 and 417 to the MCI (402), respectively. The<br>
user 3 (406), and the user 4 (408) both return acknowledgement messages 420,<br>
and 422, respectively to the MC2 (404). The MC2 (404) forwards a suitable set of<br>
acknowledgment messages 424 to the MCI (402). The MCI (402) forwards a set<br>
of acknowledgement messages 426 to the user 1 (400). More sets of<br>
acknowledgement messages may be forwarded between MCI and MC2, MCI<br>
and user 1 and user 2, MC2 and user 3 and user 4, but they are not shown here.<br>
Consequently the user 1 (400) starts an RTP session by transmitting a voice/data<br>
message (428) to the MCI (402). The MCI (402) forwards the voice/data<br>
message 430 to the user 2 (218) and forwards a set of messages 432 to the MC2<br><br><br><br>
(404), that in turn forwards the voice/data messages 434, and 436 to the user 3<br>
(406), and the user 4 (408) respectively. The graphical user interface (GUI) of the<br>
IPRS client application will be described next. The description will include the<br>
main part of the program flow and the functionality of the program at each step.<br>
The description will be given in association with the following drawings.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 17A that shows the initial display screen of the IPRS<br>
client application. Display screen 500 is part of the mobile or fixed user wireless<br>
device. The device could be a standard mobile cellular phone, a PDA, a PC, or<br>
any other computing and communicating device having a memory device and<br>
basic communications capabilities. The display screen 500 could utilize Liquid<br>
Crystal Display (LCD) technology or any other method operative in displaying<br>
text, graphic, images, and the like. The user wireless device is also equipped with<br>
voice communications interface units (not shown) such as at least one speaker<br>
device, a microphone device, and the like. On the surface area of the display<br>
device 500 various known GUI-related graphical elements, such as windows,<br>
buttons, and selections bars are displayed. Thus, on the surface of device 500 the<br>
display includes a main application screen window 504 including the title of the<br>
IPRS application, an initial window 502 including "welcoming" text, and a set of<br>
control buttons 506, 508, 510, 512. The functions of the control buttons 506, 508,<br>
510, and 512 is changeable across the various windows displayed to the operating<br>
user before, during, and subsequent the communication session. Consequently the<br>
control buttons 506, 508, 510, and 512 are labeled in diverse changeable text<br>
where the labels displayed refer to the current function of a specific button. The<br>
user can interface with the displayed windows by manipulating standard function<br>
keys (not shown), which are commonly available and typically installed on a<br>
keypad area of the mobile or fixed wireless user device. For example, to select a<br>
control button for operation a specific key, such as the "up-arrow key" could be<br>
used, and in order to activate the selected button the "Yes" key could be utilized.<br>
During the display of the initial window only the control button 512 labeled as<br><br><br>
"Close" is functional. Thus, selecting and activating the close control button 512<br>
will terminate the IPRS application. The initial window 502 is displayed when the<br>
client program is first activated or any time before the list of the online users<br>
displayed or refreshed. The welcome sentence displayed on the initial window<br>
502 appears only on program load or when the initial screen is first displayed.<br>
During the display period of the initial screen 502 the IPRS client program<br>
performs a logon to the IPRS server. If the logon to the server is performed for<br>
the first time a configuration window is displayed, which will be described in<br>
association with the following drawings. Note should be taken that the IRPS<br>
client could be working without an IPRS server as described hereinabove in<br>
association with the Figs. 9C, 9D and 13B.<br>
Subsequent to the completion of a successful connection between the<br>
client program and the server the client program obtains the list of the users with<br>
the "online" status. Optionally, the client program could also obtain a list of<br>
groups. When working without an IPRS server the list of users is taken from the<br>
internal address book of the client where status of the users is unknown. Fig. 17B<br>
shows online users list window displayed to the initiating user. The display screen<br>
500 consists of main application window 504 labeled with the client program<br>
name, the online users list window 514, a selection bar 503, and the control<br>
buttons 506, 508, 510, and 512. The online users list window 514 includes text<br>
indicating the names of the set of online users with associated information, such<br>
as "paged", "free", "busy", and the like. The selection bar 503 is operative in<br>
enabling the initiating user to select a specific online user in order to initiate a<br>
communication session therewith. The selection bar is manipulated through the<br>
activation of a predefined function key on the mobile wireless unit, such as the<br>
"up-arrow" key, and the "down-arrow key". By repeatedly pressing one of the<br>
above mentioned function keys the selection bar moves from one online user<br>
name to the next name. The calling of a selected user is effected by the selection<br>
and activation of the control button 506 that is appropriately labeled as "Page"<br><br><br>
during the display of the window 514. The control button 508 optionally labeled<br>
as "Rfrsh" to provide the refreshing of the display within the online users list<br>
window 514. The selection and activation of the control button 510 labeled as<br>
"Confg" is operative in the loading of the Configuration window that will be<br>
described hereunder in association with the following drawings. The function of<br>
the control button 512 labeled as "Close" is to terminate the IPRS client<br>
application, to free all the system resources allocated to the communication<br>
session and tear down the connection between the client device and the IPRS<br>
server. For example, in the 514 window the text informs the user that Alice, Bob,<br>
Charley, and David are online users. Alice is talking with one person and may<br>
accept call waiting. Charley is talking with two persons. Bob and Alice are not<br>
talking. Bob is selected by the selection bar 503. Activating the "Page" control<br>
button 506 will initiate an attempt to create a connection to Bob. The selection bar<br>
503 will stay on the last person the initiating user communicated with or tried to<br>
create a connection with.<br>
If no users listed on the server with "online" status then the client<br>
application receives appropriate information from the server. Fig. 17C shows the<br>
online users list window 516 indicating an empty list of online users with a<br>
notification message displayed in the window 516 along with suitable instructions<br>
concerning the continuation of the session. For example, the text could optionally<br>
include the instruction "Press refresh to try again". The control button 508 labeled<br>
"Rfrsh" is optionally operative instructing the program to access the server again<br>
and attempt to obtain a preferably updated list of the online users. The "Close"<br>
control button 512 is operative in terminating the application, freeing the<br>
allocated resources and in tearing down the communication link between the user<br>
and the server. Typically selecting and activating the "close" control button 512 at<br>
any time during the operation of the program will instantly abort the connection<br>
and terminate the program.<br><br><br>
Fig. 18A shows the paging attempt window. The paging attempt<br>
window 516 is displayed when a paging attempt is made to another user. The<br>
name of the user called is displayed on the top of the window 516. Selecting and<br>
activating the "Abrt" control button 508 will abort the paging and the program<br>
will display the online users list window 514 with the associated control buttons.<br>
If the user paged is talking the prompt to page waiting window will be displayed.<br>
If the user called is busy the busy screen will be displayed.<br>
Fig. 18B shows the prompt to page waiting window 522. The window<br>
522 informs the initiating user that the other person is being paged by a third<br>
party and inquires the initiating user whether a page waiting should be performed.<br>
If the initiating user chooses not to disturb the user called men the "Abrt" control<br>
button 508 is selected and activated. Activating the "Page" control button 506<br>
will place a call effecting a page waiting situation at the user called. Optionally a<br>
timeout feature could be added to the client program. The timeout routine will<br>
abort the call after a time period having a predefined length.<br>
If the user called is busy by talking to at least two other users the busy<br>
window is displayed to the initiating user. Fig. 19A shows the busy window 524.<br>
Selecting and activating the "Page" control button 506 will initiate an attempt to<br>
page the user again. The "Abrt" call button 508 will abort the connection attempt,<br>
and will re-display the initial window 502 of Fig. 17A.<br>
If the user paged rejects the inviting message the reject message e<br>
window will be displayed to the initiating user. Fig. 19B shows the rejected<br>
message window 526. In order to try and initiate the paging again the "page"<br>
 control button 506 should be selected and activated. To abort the call attempt and<br>
re-display the initial window 502 of Fig. 17A the "Abrt" control button 508<br>
should be activated.<br>
Subsequent to the establishment of a connection between two users a<br>
 voice transmission could be performed by pressing a predefined function key<br><br><br>
installed on the client device. The function key that is defined for this purpose<br>
could be any of the standard keys available, such as the Press to Talk (FIT) key,<br>
the space bar, and the like. Fig. 19C shows the talk mode window 528, which is<br>
displayed with the associated control buttons 506, 508, 510, and 512 for the<br>
duration of an established communication session between the users. The name of<br>
the connected user is displayed within the talk mode window 528. If a third party<br>
is waiting a message 529 containing the name thereof will be displayed beneath<br>
the message indicating the ongoing paging with the original user called. The<br>
message 529 may be displayed in a specific graphic mode such as a blinking text<br>
or a colored text. To switch the paging from the originally called user to the<br>
waiting third party or switch the paging back to the originally called user the<br>
"Swtch" control button 506 should be selected and activated. The "Abrt" control<br>
button 508 will terminate the connection and abort the paging. If a third party is<br>
waiting the paging be automatically switched thereto. The same effect is achieved<br>
if the another user terminates the paging. If the user waiting aborts then the<br>
waiting message 529 thereof will be deleted from the window 528. If the user<br>
with whom the call is established switches to another call the waiting window<br>
(not shown) will be displayed to the initiating user within which the message<br>
"Talking to XXX" will be replaced by the message "Waiting for XXX". The text<br>
of the message could be optionally in a specific graphic mode, such as blinking<br>
text or differently colored characters. If only one user is connected and an another<br>
paging is received, the page waiting window will be displayed to the initiating<br>
user.<br>
Fig. 20 shows the configuration window. The configuration window<br>
534 enables the user to insert, update, and modify self-related personal<br>
information. The configuration window 534 is displayed automatically at the first<br>
system start up, as it is obligatory for a first-time user to configure the system<br>
with self-related personal data. The user modifies the information via the<br>
utilization of the standard available keyboard installed on the client device. The<br><br><br>
"OK" control button 506 effects the updating of the information stored within the<br>
system. The "Cancel" control button 508 is operative in deleting the text typed.<br>
After the activation of the "OK" control button 506 the program examines the text<br>
introduced by the user, rejects invalid text, and suitably notifies the user.<br>
Subsequently the user could repeat the process of introducing configuration text<br>
until the text is validated, approved, and accepted by the program.<br>
It would be easily understood by a person with ordinary skill in the art that<br>
the user interface and the underlying program logic associated with a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention was set forth hereinabove with the intention<br>
of enabling a ready understanding of the concepts of the proposed system and<br>
method. The interface described is exemplary only and many other different<br>
display methods involving diverse graphical elements such as pull-down menus,<br>
list boxes, radio buttons, and the like could be used in other preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention. In addition the program flow could<br>
substantially differ in other preferred embodiments to support additional<br>
advanced functions, which could be contemplated, and implemented during the<br>
realization of the proposed method and system. Some useful features could be<br>
added to the method and system, such as providing a busy message for a calling<br>
user while the user called retrieving the online users list, providing a busy<br>
message to a calling user while the user called is placing a call, the addition of a<br>
"Do not answer" warning button to effect the termination of an unwanted call<br>
while the user called is talking, an unproved online users list having additional<br>
data and a scroll position indicator, and the like.<br>
It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the present<br>
invention is not limited to what has been particularly shown and described<br>
hereinabove. Rather the scope of the present invention is defined only by the<br>
