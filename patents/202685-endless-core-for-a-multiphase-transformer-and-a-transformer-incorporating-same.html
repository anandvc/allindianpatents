ENDLESS CORE FOR A MULTIPHASE TRANSFORMER AND A TRANSFORMER INCORPORATING SAME;<br>
MERLEX CORPORATION PTY LTD., A CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF AUSTRALIA, WHOSE ADDRESS IS 77 CHATSWORTH STREET, HIGHGATE WA 6865, AUSTRALIA.<br><br><br><br>
THE       FOLLOWING       SPECIFICATION<br>
	PARTICULARLY       DESCRIBES       THE<br>
NATURE OF THIS INVENTION  AND THE MANNER    IN    WHICH    IT    IS    TO    BE PERFOMED. 1<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an endless core fojuiiultiphase transformer .and a jr^sfooncriacorporating such a core-<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Multiphase transformers are well known and are used in a variety of applications including for stepping up or stepping down line voltage in power transmission systems, to provide phase shifting, modulation, star-delta converters and general power supplies.<br>
A typical multiphase transformer has a planar core provided with a number of square or rectangular windows each window being bound by upper and lower branches of the core, and on opposite sides by vertical legs forming part of the core. A primary winding is wound through each window, either on a branch or leg of the window. similarly a secondary winding is would through each window. Irrespective of the number of phases* if the core has N windows then it will have N + 1 vertical legs. Tjiis provides an inherent magnetic and therefore electrical imbalance between the phases./ This arises because the magnetic flux created by current flow in the primary windings cannot circulate equally about the respective windows because of the additional vertical leg. As a result, assuming each primary phase voltage is of the same magnitude and each secondary winding has the same number of turns, then the secondary outputs cannot be the same. The transformation process is not identical between the phases due to die difference in magnetic paths surrounding each window. In order to produce equalised outputs on the secondary windings, ie the same magnitude output on each winding, some of the primary or secondary windings must vary the number of turns to take account of the difference in flux distribution circulating about different windows of the transformer core. Such transformers also have an inherent inefficiencies due to flux leakage caused by the end windows having only a single flux return path.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
Referring to Figure I, there is illustrated an endless core 10 for a multiphase (in this example, six phase) transformer 12. Tl»e core 10 is formed as an endless circular or annular loop. A. plurality of windows 14,-144 (referred to in general as windows 14,) are formed through and about the core 10. Adjacent windows 14j share a common portion or leg 16*jj where, and t designate the adjacent windows. For example, leg 16u is the portion of core 10 between adjacent windows 14, and 142; and leg 160 is the portion or leg of core 10 between adjacent windows 144 and 145. It will be appreciated that because the core 10 is endless, there are no dead ends in so far as magnetic flux is concerned and therefore the core 10 facilitates the existence of<br>
5<br><br>
symmetrical magnetic flux through the core 10.<br>
Each window 14, is bound on .opposite sides by the adjacent, core portions or legs 16^ and, by upper and lower branches Bu and Bj. Thus, for example window 14, is bound on the left side by common core portion 16,y, on the right side by common cere portion 166l; upper branch Bu; and, lower branch B,.<br>
Multiphase transformer 12 is constructed by winding respective primary and secondary windings through the windows 14,. In the embodiment shown, primary windings 18, and 18* (referred to in general as primary windings 18 j link with respective windows 14j. More particularly, two primary windings I8; (of the same phase) are provided for each window 14,, with one primary winding about the upper branch B„ and another primary winding about a lower branch B, of each window 14,. For example, looking at window 14, a pair of primary windings 18, is provided, one of each formed about the upper branch Bu and lower branch B, of the window 14,.<br>
When the primary windings 18, are coupled to respective phases of a six phase AC power supply lines of magnetic flux <j>-, are generated and circulate about at least the window through which the primary winding 18, is wound. Again taking for example window 14, when the primary windings 18, are connected to one phase of the six phase AC power supply, lines of magnetic flux  are generated that circulate about window 14,. However, it must be appreciated that the magnetic flux generated can also circulate or return about other windows 14,. Thus a part of the magnetic flux , can circulate about both windows 14, and 142 returning through legs 16w and 166, and circulate about windows 14,, 142 and 146 returning via legs 16^ and \6i6.<br>
The placement of secondary windings through the windows 14, is dependent upon die desired output If it is desired that the phase of the output from the secondary windings is to be the same as the phase of the corresponding primary winding then secondary windings 20„ - 20,6 can be wound for example about the lower branch B, of each window 14, - 146 respectively. (Of course in a variation, the secondary windings 20,, - 20,6 can be placed about the upper branches B, of each window or<br>
6<br><br>
*<br>
even alternate between the upper and lower branches.) it will be appreciated that because of the symmetric distribution of magnetic flux fy about each of the windows 14,, assuming that the primary voltage for rach phase is of the same magnitude, the magnitude of the voltage output from the secondary windings 20ti will be the same if each of the secondary windings 20^ have the same number of turns. Thus, the core 10 and transformer 12 provide the ability to have secondary output of equal magnitude where the secondary windings 20„ - 20* have the same number of turns. As discussed above in relation to the prior art, because of the inherent magnetic imbalance of known cores and transformers, in order to have secondary outputs of equal magnitude in a multiphase transformer one must deliberately design some of the coils to have different number of turns.<br>
The core 10 and transformer 12 also allow for an infinite possibility of phase shifting or combining. If one wanted to obtain a secondary output of a phase halfway between the phase of say the primary voltages supplying primary windings 18, and 182 then a secondary winding 20p (shown in phantom) can be wound through botii windows 14, and 142 ie about the common core portion 16u. Now. the second winding 20riinks with the magnetic flux <j>, and fa; andlhus the secondary output is of a magnitude and phase corresponding to the vector or phasor addition of the voltage induced by fluxes , and <j>2. This provides a 1:1 transformed combination of<br>
-:■"	-     -. .. i	,<br>
the phases feeding primary windings 18, and 182. However combinations of other ratios and thus different amounts of phase shifting can be achieved at will byj;jmply winding the secondary winding 20p about the upper or lower branches BU,B, or common core portions 16,j of different windows. For example, in the embodiment shown in Figure 1, the primary phases arc 60° apart To obtain a secondary ouqjut having a phase 15° (ie V* the phase difference) in advance of the phase of the primary voltage feeding primary winding 18, a secondary winding (not shown) is provided having a 1:4 turn ratio about branch B, of window 14, and branch B, of window 142, ie the secondary winding has four turns passing through window 142 for every turn passing dirough window 14,.<br>
7<br><br>
Figure 2 illustrates a core 10' suitable for constructing a twelve phase transformer 12'. Here, the core 10' is again in shape of a ring or annulus but, this time provided with twelve windows 14, - 14,2 and twelve common core portions 1^, one of each between respective adjacent windows 14t. A primary winding 13j is wound about lower branch B, of each window 14;. A secondary winding 20, is wound about the upper branch B„ of each window 14,. The phase of the output of any secondary winding 20; is the same as the phase of voltage driving the corresponding primary winding 18,. However, as with the previous embodiment, the secondary winding 20; can be wound partially about the upper and lower branches B„ and B, or common core portions 16,j of different windows in any desired combination to produce a desired phase output in accordance with standard transformer design technics.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates an extending (vertically stacked) core 10" and z multiphase transformer 12* constructed using the core 10". The core 10" can be considered as being two six window cores vertically stacked upon each other. Thus the core 10" has a lower set of windows 14, - 146 and an upper set of windows 147 - 1412 with windows 14, and 14^ in vertical alignment Primary windings 18, - 186 are wound about the lower branches B, of windows 14, - 146 respectively; and, primary windings 187 - 18,2 are wound about the upper branches B, of the upper set of windows 14, - 14,2. A set of secondary windings 20 are wound about the middle branch Bm between vertically adjacent windows 14,, 14^. Therefore, in this particular illustrated embodiment, there are only six secondary coils 20. The output of any particular secondary winding 20 would be the transformed phasor or vector addition of voltages induced by the magnetic flux generated by the primary windings linked with the windows common-to that particular^secondary winding 20. In order to avoid saturation it js. preferred that the yojume of core constituting the middle<br>
branch B„, is the sura of the volume of the core constituting the lower branch B, and<br>
		 ■•»■■■		'■     - •■'---" -■•"""	.«_■»—«»,.,,_iii_^„.-,.-„—.,-.&gt;-.....„ ......._.J^i&gt;__<br>
upper branch B, of the windows.JL4*-,JL4u«* jThis embodiment then allows the combination of two six phase supplies that are out of phase with each otherJ For example, if diere are two six phase power supplies, one providing input to coils 18, -186 and anodier providing input to primary windings 18, - 18u, the two power sources can be combined to provide a six phase output through the secondary<br>
8<br><br>
windings 20. This could be particularly useful in for example coupling two multiple phase, power supplies to a common power transmission grid.  The core configuration will also allow for the ability to have 6 primary and 12 secondary windings! J\lso_a_._ turns ratio of 1/0.5 primary to secondary, or secondary to primary, as well as incorporating other windows will produce any fraction of volts required.<br>
In a different configuration (not illustrated) die primary windings 18, - 18,2 of transformer 12" can be connected to a different phase of a twelve phase power supply and primary windings 20 round through various windows 14, to provide a transformed twelve phase output Again, the phasing of the output from the secondary windings can be arranged as required in accordance with known transformer design techniques to provide the desired secondary phase output.<br>
Figure 4 further illustrates a further embodiment of the core 10'" and a corresponding 12'". In the embodiments shown in Figures 1-3 die core 10 and windows 14, are arranged so mat the core 10, 10' and 10"' is endless about a first axis that is perpendicular to the axis of any particular window 14-,. With die core 10"' of Figure 4, the axis of the core 10 is parallel witii die axis of any window 14,. As with all previous embodiments, core 10'" is configured as an endless loop having a plurality of windows 14, where adjacent windows share a common portion of core 16-,j so that they number of windows 14, equals die number of common core portions 16-,^. More specifically, riiree windows 14, - 14j are formed in the core 10'" with a primary winding 18, - 18j respectively wound about me lower (radially outer most) branches B, of each window 14,. Respective secondary windings 20, - 203 arc wound through the windows 14, - 143 respectively about die corresponding upper (radially inner most) branches B„. It is preferred tiiat the core 10'" is configured so that the volume of core in the upper and lower branch portions B,, B. of each window 14, is the same. This assists.in avoiding saturation of die core. This can be achieved by appropriate placement or configuration of the windows 14r<br>
Figure 5 illustrates an application of the core 10 shown in Figure 1. The core 10 is used  in  this application  in a  transverse  flux motor 26.     Full  operation  and<br><br>
constructional details of the transverse flux motor are described in the Applicant's Australian Application No PP 7124 the contents of which is incorporated herein by way of reference. The structure, of core 10 and the placement of primary windings 18, - 186 is identical to that described in the first embodiment described in relation to Figure 1. Howevej, instead of multi turn electrically separate secondary windings a single turn secondary winding between 20s is provided about each common core portion 16jj with each of the single turn secondary windings 20, being in mutual electrical connection. Thus, the single turn secondary windings 20, - 206 form a wheel like structure 30 having an inner rim 32 and outer rim 34 joined by radially extending spokes 36. The outer rim 34 is depicted as residing in the air gap 38 of a cockcroft ring 40. Without going into the detail of operation of the motor 26, currents are induced through the single turn secondary windings 20, - 206 that interact with magnetic flux passing through the air gap 38 of the cockcroft ring 40 thereby generating transverse forces on the outer rim 34 of the wheel 30 causing it to move. The path of motion of the wheel 30 can be-controlled at will by variation of the magnitude and frequency of the primary voltages supplied to the primary coil 18, - 18c and the phase relationship therebetween.<br>
Now that embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail it will be apparent to those skilled in the relevant arts and numerous modifications and variations may be made without departing from the basic inventive concepts. For example, in each of the embodiments shown, the core 10 is depicted essentially as being in a ring, annulus or circular type form. However it can assume other shapes provided that it is continuous or endless and is provided with equal numbers of windows and common core portions. Also, the exact number of windows provided is simply dependent upon the application and in particular the number of primary phases. Also, the position and placement of the secondary windings 20, is dictated solely by the desired magnitude and phase of die secondary outputs. The core 10, 10', 10", 10'" can be made by casting; continuous stamping and winding of an insulated strip of magnetically permeable material; winding of a strip of material then machining/cutting the windows. Further the core can be split through a plane passing through the windows 14;   to facilitate mechanical/automatic winding of the<br>
10<br><br>
primary and/or secondary windings about the window branches B„, B,. or loading of prewound bobbins on the common core portions 16^. All such variations and modifications together with others that would be obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art arc decmeil to be within the scope of the present invention the nature of which is to be determined from the aforegoing description.<br><br>
