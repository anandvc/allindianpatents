OIL TYPE RELEASE AGENT FOR DIE CASTINGING,<br>
METHOD FOR SETTING SOLVENT MIXING RATIO,<br>
CASTING METHOD, AND SPRAY UNIT<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an oil type<br>
release agent for die casting, a method for setting a<br>
solvent mixing ratio, a casting method using the oil<br>
type release agent, and a spray unit. The invention is<br>
also applicable for a plunger chip as a lubricant.<br>
Background Art<br>
As is well known, in die casting, to lubricate the<br>
cavity part of a die, an oil film is formed on the<br>
cavity surface of the die by spraying a lubricant<br>
called as a release agent after die opening. The oil<br>
film prevents a cavity from soldering of a non-ferrous<br>
molten metal of such as aluminum, magnesium and zinc on<br>
the cavity and makes possible casting continuously.<br>
The release agents for die casting are broadly<br>
classified into the oil type release agent and a water<br>
soluble type relase agent. In terms of the<br>
productivity, the safety, and the work environments,<br>
the water soluble type relase agent has often been used<br>
in recent years.<br>
However, before 40 years ago, a release agent was<br>
only oil type (hereinafter, referred to as old oil type<br>
release agent) containing solid matters of lard, powder<br>
and graphite with which machinery is made sticky after<br>
use. Users diluted the agent with an economical<br>
kerosene or solvent and sprayed the diluted agent.<br>
However since the old oil type release agent contained<br>
a powder, the powder scattered in the peripheral areas<br>
of the die during casting, worsened the work<br>
environments and deposited on the die. Thus frequent<br>
cleaning was indispensable. The old oil type release<br>
agent was mixed with kerosene which had a low flash<br>
point. It was so risky as to cause a fire and thus<br>
made automation of die casting difficult. Because of<br>
this reason, the old oil type release agent was applied<br>
manually, resulting in low production efficiency.<br>
Further, since the refining degree of the kerosene was<br>
low and trace components such as sulfur or the like<br>
were contained, the agent might inevitably cause<br>
adverse effects on the human body and emitted intense<br>
oily smell. That is, the old oil type release agent<br>
had risks of fire and explosion, was unsuitable for<br>
automation, polluted the working environments with oil<br>
and powders, and inevitably required periodic cleaning<br>
works.<br>
Because of the above described situations, the old<br>
oil type release agent was changed to the water soluble<br>
type relase agent with less risk of firing for<br>
automation. It is no exaggeration to say that 99% of<br>
release agents made commercially available are<br>
water-soluble-type release agents now. On the other<br>
hand, very a few oil type relase agents containing no<br>
solid matter (hereinafter, referred to simply as highly<br>
viscid oil type release agent) have continuously been<br>
used. Such oil type release agents have an excellent<br>
lubricating property. However, the viscosity is very<br>
high (dynamic viscosity at 40°C is 100 mm^/s or higher)<br>
and even if they are sprayed, the produced mist has a<br>
large diameter. Therefore, the agents are unsuitable<br>
for automatic spraying and consequently consumed much,<br>
and the oil components of them are entrained and<br>
gasified in the flow of molten metal to remain in the<br>
form of gas in cast products and accordingly result in<br>
increase of the porosity. Consequently, utilizing the<br>
excellent lubricating property of them, the old oil<br>
type release agents have presently been used only for<br>
warm-up operation before applying the water soluble<br>
type relase agent.<br>
On the other hand, the water soluble type relase<br>
agent free from the risk of the fire has a crucial<br>
defective point in the capability. Since the agent is<br>
diluted with water about 80 times as much at the time<br>
of use, 99% of the main component are water and<br>
therefore the agent causes Leidenfrost phenomenon on<br>
the die at around 150°C. That is, the release agent<br>
mist is explosively evaporated around 150°C and the die<br>
surface is covered with a steam film. Therefore the<br>
release agent mist, which comes next, cannot arrive at<br>
the die surface. This causes the decrease of the<br>
adhesion amount of active components in the release<br>
agent on the die surface. To increase the adhesion<br>
amount, the die temperature is kept below the<br>
Leidenfrost temperature by spraying a large quantity of<br>
the water soluble type relase agent while scarifying<br>
the adhesion efficiency. As a matter of fact,<br>
presently the spray amount is approximately the same as<br>
the number of the tons of the locking force of a<br>
casting machine (e.g. about 350 cc for a 350 t-machine,<br>
about 2500 cc for a 2500 t-machine). Naturally, the<br>
peripheral areas of the machine become dirty, the waste<br>
fluid is much, thereby it is required much labor and<br>
cost for cleaning and waste fluid treatment. Also,<br>
since almost all the water soluble type relase agents<br>
contain waxes, solidified waxes adhere to the die<br>
surface and deposit to peripheral areas of the machine.<br>
It requires frequent cleaning. Not only the pollution<br>
in the peripheral areas of the machine due to the<br>
precipitation and adhesion of the release agent's<br>
components, but also oxidation deterioration of the<br>
components has to be taken into consideration. Patent<br>
Document 1 (Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 8-<br>
103913) describes the use of an oxidation prevention<br>
agent for suppressing oil component deterioration in<br>
the water soluble type relase agent. The invention<br>
aims the pollution prevention of a die in a rubber<br>
vulcanization process. And it also discloses a<br>
countermeasure for apparently decreasing stains on the<br>
die.<br>
Further, the die is heated to about 200 to 350°C<br>
with aluminum molten metal every shot and thereafter<br>
cooled to about 100 to 150°C with the water soluble<br>
type relase agent. The temperature of the die surface<br>
fluctuates from 100 to 200°C in every shot.<br>
Consequently, after continuous casting for a long<br>
duration (several thousand times for a large scale die<br>
and several ten thousand times for a small scale die),<br>
thermal fatigue is accumulated in the die surface, socalled<br>
cracks are formed and finally the costly die is<br>
broken. This is the present situation.<br>
Further, since the water soluble type relase agent<br>
has a strong cooling capability, the molten aluminum<br>
injected into the cavity is cooled within a short time.<br>
The viscosity of the molten metal is increased to<br>
disturb the molten metal flow. Finally the molten<br>
metal can not reach to every fine corner of the cavity.<br>
As a result, so-called "misrun" and "shrinkage"<br>
phenomena occur and make it impossible to produce a<br>
complete cast product. Also, since the adhesion<br>
efficiency of the water soluble type relase agent is<br>
low, the oil film on the metal surface is thin.<br>
Soldering may often occur at high temperature portions<br>
of the die, especially thin parts like core pins.<br>
Porosity, which decreases the strength of the cast<br>
product, is also a problem. The cause of the porosity<br>
is to entrain organic matters and water into turbulent<br>
flow of the molten metal and to gasify in the casting<br>
product. If an excessive amount of the release agent<br>
is sprayed, the porosity increases. In the past, to<br>
lower the porosity, Patent Document 2 (Jpn. Pat. Appln.<br>
KOKAI Publication No. 2000-33457) disclosed a powder<br>
type release agent having excellent releasing<br>
capabilities.<br>
In the above-mentioned current situation, it has<br>
been desired to improve the disadvantageously low<br>
adhesion efficiency of the water soluble type relase<br>
agent, to improve the spraying property of highly<br>
viscus oil type release agent while keeping the<br>
excellent lubrication property, and to make it possible<br>
to achieve "very small amount of spray", "long die lie"<br>
and "less waste fluid".<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
The present invention aims to provide the oil type<br>
release agent without formulating water. The oil type<br>
release agent enables the long die, life less waste<br>
fluid, excellent releasing lubricating property at a<br>
high temperature and very small amount of spray. By<br>
setting appropriate viscosity at 40°C, very small<br>
amount of spray is achieved resulting in less vapor<br>
scatting in air.<br>
Also, the invention aims to provide a setting<br>
method of a solvent mixing ratio at which the<br>
Leidenfrost phenomenon can be avoided by setting the<br>
mixing ratio of two kinds of solvents, or a solvent<br>
with mineral oils and/or synthetic oils at the time of<br>
die casting using the above-mentioned oil type release<br>
agent for die casting.<br>
Further, the invention aims to provide the oil<br>
type release agent for die casting, a casting method,<br>
and a spraying unit by which the spraying amount can be<br>
saved as compared with that in conventional methods and<br>
problems such as galling, flow line, metal wave, and<br>
porosity can be solved.<br>
1) In order to achieve the above-described<br>
objects, the oil type release agent of the invention<br>
(first invention) contains: (a) 70 to 98 parts by<br>
weight of solvents having dynamic viscosity of 2 to<br>
10 mm^/s at 40°C and having the flash point in the<br>
range of 70 to 170°C; (b) 1 to 10 parts by weight of a<br>
high viscosity mineral oils and/or synthetic oils<br>
having dynamic viscosity of 100 mm2/s or higher at<br>
40°C; (c) 15 parts by weight or less of a silicone oil<br>
having dynamic viscosity of 150 mm^/s or higher at<br>
40°C; and (d) 1 to 5 parts by weight of the additives<br>
having a lubricating capability, wherein the flash<br>
point of the agent is in the range of 70 to 170°C, and<br>
dynamic viscosity of the agent is 2 to 30 mm^/s at<br>
40°C.<br>
According to the first invention, the oil type<br>
release agent contains no water to avoid inhibition of<br>
the lubricating property and provides lubrication<br>
because of oil components. It is particularly<br>
excellent in the releasing lubricating property at the<br>
high temperature. Further, since no water is<br>
contained, the die is not cooled with the release<br>
agent. Thus the die life is prolonged, the scattering<br>
of the agent in air is decreased and the die casting is<br>
carried out free from the waste fluid. Particularly,<br>
the agent is suitable for automatic continuous spraying<br>
and excellent in application of a small amount of a<br>
neat liquid and wettability. Further, according to the<br>
first invention, the oil type release agent enables the<br>
smaller spraying amount than the conventional agent and<br>
the reduction of die casting problems such as galling,<br>
flow line, metal wave and porosity.<br>
2) The invention (the second invention) provides a<br>
method for setting a mixing ratio of the solvent in the<br>
oil type release agent to avoid Leidenfrost phenomenon<br>
at the time of die casting. Two or more kinds of<br>
solvents can be used as the solvents for mixing. The<br>
method consists of the first, second, third and fourth<br>
steps. The first step is to interpolate the expected<br>
highest use temperature (S) in the following equations<br>
(1) and (2) for calculating a needed flash point (F) of<br>
the release agent to be formulated. The second step is<br>
to measure flash points for three or more different<br>
release agents having different concentrations of the<br>
respective solvents. The third step is to make a graph<br>
on the correlation between the % values by weight of<br>
the solvent in each release agent and the flash point<br>
of each release agent. The fourth step is to estimate<br>
the % value by weight of the solvent in the release<br>
agent to be formulated from the graph and the needed<br>
flash point which was calculated from in the first<br>
step.<br>
S + 80 = L (1)<br>
L = 4.4 x F + 36 (2)<br>
where S denotes the highest temperature for use of a<br>
release agent; L denotes Leidenfrost phenomenon<br>
temperature; and F denotes the flash point of the<br>
release agent.<br>
According to the second invention, it is possible<br>
to avoid Leidenfrost phenomenon at the time of die<br>
casting using the oil type release agent.<br>
3) The invention (the third invention) provides a<br>
method for setting a mixing ratio of the solvent with<br>
the mineral oil and/or synthetic oil. The purpose is<br>
to avoid Leidenfrost phenomenon at the time of die<br>
casting using the oil type release agent according to<br>
claim 1. The method comprises the steps of<br>
interpolating an expected highest use temperature (S)<br>
in the above equations (1) and (2) for calculating an<br>
flash point (F) of a release agent; preparing three or<br>
more different release agents having different<br>
concentrations of the respective solvents, mineral oils<br>
and/or synthetic oils; investigating the flash point<br>
for each prepared release agent; producing a graph of<br>
the correlation of the % by weight of the solvent in<br>
each release agent and the flash point of each release<br>
agent; and calculating the % by weight of the solvent<br>
in the release agent from the graph and the flash point<br>
calculated from the equations (1) and (2).<br>
The third invention has the same effect as that of<br>
the second invention.<br>
4) A casting method of the invention (the fourth<br>
invention) involves die casting by using the oil type<br>
release agent of the above-mentioned 1) with a release<br>
agent application machine. According to the fourth<br>
invention, the casting method capable of die casting<br>
using the oil type release agent of the first invention<br>
is provided.<br>
5) A spray unit of the invention (the fifth<br>
invention) is the spray system for spraying and<br>
applying the oil type release agent according to the<br>
above-described 1) to a die. This system comprises a<br>
release agent spray unit with multiple spray nozzles to<br>
apply the oil type release agent to the die surface and<br>
a pressurized delivery unit which supplies the release<br>
agent under a low pressure condition to the spray unit<br>
and applies the small amount of the release agent to<br>
the die. According to the fifth invention, it is<br>
possible to spray the oil type release agent which is<br>
described in the first invention.<br>
6) The invention (the sixth invention) provides a<br>
casting method for carrying out die casting using the<br>
spray unit according to the above-described 4) and the<br>
oil type release agent.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter the invention will be described in<br>
detail.<br>
(1) The oil type release agent for die casting of<br>
the invention (the first invention) contains (a) 70 to<br>
98 parts by weight of solvents having dynamic viscosity<br>
of 2 to 10 mm2/s at 40°C and the flash point in the<br>
range of 70 to 170°C; (b) 1 to 10 parts by weight of<br>
the mineral oils and/or synthetic oils having dynamic<br>
'viscosity of 100 mm^/s or higher at 40°C; (c) 15 parts<br>
by weight or less of a silicone oil having dynamic<br>
viscosity of 150 mm2/s or higher at 40°C; and (d) 1 to<br>
5 parts by weight of additives having a lubricating<br>
function, wherein the flash point of the agent is in<br>
the range of 70 to 170°C, and dynamic viscosity of the<br>
agent is 2 to 30 mm2/s at 40°C.<br>
(2) The component (a) of the above-mentioned (1)<br>
is a highly volatile and low viscosity component and is<br>
to be evaporated in the die surface. In this<br>
connection, taking the effect on the human body into<br>
consideration, any solvents with high polarity such as<br>
alcohols, esters, and ketones should not be used, and a<br>
petroleum type solvent containing mostly saturated<br>
components and a low viscosity base oil are preferable.<br>
Examples of them are saturated solvents and low<br>
viscosity synthetic oils which are highly refined to<br>
suppress a sulfur component to 1 ppm or lower. The<br>
dynamic viscosity at 40°C is specified to be of 2 to<br>
10 mm^/s in the above-mentioned (a). When the<br>
viscosity of the solvent is too low like 2 mm2/s or<br>
lower, the viscosity of entire release agent becomes<br>
too low as well. On the other hand, when the viscosity<br>
of the solvent is too viscous like 10 mm^/s or higher,<br>
the viscosity of entire release agent becomes too<br>
viscous as well. Further, the ratio of the abovementioned<br>
(a) is adjusted to be 70 to 97 parts by<br>
weight for optimizing volatile of the entire release<br>
agent.<br>
 (3) The flash point of the above-mentioned<br>
component (a) of (1) is adjusted to be in the range of<br>
70°C to 170°C because of the following reasons. That<br>
is, to form a thick oil film on the die surface, just<br>
like the case of a quick dry type paint, it is better<br>
to evaporate solvents so quickly as to avoid dripping<br>
of once adhered components from the die surface.<br>
Therefore it is desirable to have a high evaporation<br>
speed. However, if the evaporation speed is too fast,<br>
Leidenfrost phenomenon may occur as seen with the water<br>
soluble type relase agent. Therefore those solvents<br>
having a high evaporation speed like gasoline are not<br>
preferable. Further, if the evaporation is fast, the<br>
flash point becomes low resulting in a high risk of a<br>
fire accident. Accordingly, the flash point is<br>
adjusted to be higher 43°C, which is the flash point of<br>
old oil type release agents containing kerosene. And<br>
it is preferable to be higher than the flash point<br>
(70°C) of automotive diesel fuel from the practical<br>
standpoint. Therefore, the flash point of the<br>
composition of the invention is defined to be 70°C or<br>
higher.<br>
On the other hand, in the case of the die with a<br>
high temperature, the higher flash point is preferable<br>
to suppress the evaporation property of the release<br>
agent. However the viscosity of the release agent also<br>
becomes higher. If the viscosity is high, the sprayed<br>
state of the release agent is worsened. There should<br>
be an upper limit on viscosity. The upper limit of the<br>
viscosity corresponds to the flash point of 170°C and<br>
accordingly, the flash point is determined to be 170°C<br>
or lower.<br>
With respect to the (a) component of the abovementioned<br>
(1), mineral oils and/or synthetic oils with<br>
low viscosity may be added to the above-mentioned<br>
solvents to adjust the amount to be 70 to 98 parts by<br>
weight in total. In the case where the (a) component<br>
is only solvent, two or more kinds of solvents may be<br>
used. In the case of no adjustment on the basis of<br>
Leidenfrost phenomenon, one kind of solvent may be used<br>
alone.<br>
(4) The mineral oils and/or synthetic oils with<br>
high viscosity, which are the component (b) of the<br>
above-mentioned (1), are adhered on the die surface.<br>
The adhered components consequently make the<br>
lubricating film thick at a temperature range of about<br>
150 to 300°C and accordingly take a role of keeping the<br>
lubrication. These components are required to have an<br>
appropriate viscosity at the die temperature to prevent<br>
dripping of the adhering oil from the die surface for<br>
several seconds which correspond to the time from spray<br>
to injection of molten metal. However, the die<br>
temperature differs in a respective die machine. Even<br>
in the same machine, the temperature differs in the<br>
portions of the die. Therefore, the die temperature is<br>
assumed to be 150°C or higher in the entire body and<br>
the dynamic viscosity of the mineral oils and/or<br>
synthetic oils with high viscosity at 40°C is adjusted<br>
to be 100 mm2/s or higher.<br>
Further, if the mixing amount of the (b) component<br>
is low, the lubricating film on the die surface becomes<br>
thin. If the mixing amount is too high, problems may<br>
occur. One is that spraying state becomes instable.<br>
The other is that the thick lubricating film may causes<br>
the appearance change of a cast product partially (socalled<br>
remaining color). To deal with these problems,<br>
the addition amount of the component (b) is determined<br>
to be 1 to 10 parts by weight. Examples to be used as<br>
the component (b) are petroleum type mineral oils,<br>
synthetic oils, and cylinder oils.<br>
(5) The silicone oil, which is the component (c)<br>
of the above-mentioned (1), is for fortifying the<br>
lubricating property at a high temperature. The<br>
component is determined to be silicone oil having a<br>
dynamic viscosity of 150 mm^/s or higher at 40°C in an<br>
amount of 15 parts by weight or less. This component<br>
is also for keeping the lubricating property at a<br>
temperature as high as about 250°C to 400°C by adhering<br>
to the die surface. Since it is expected to keep the<br>
lubricating property in a higher temperature range than<br>
that of the highly viscous mineral oil of the component<br>
 (b) , the dynamic viscosity at 40°C is preferably higher<br>
than that of the component (b), that is 150 mm^/s or<br>
higher.<br>
With respect to the "silicone oil" of the<br>
component (c) of the above-mentioned (1), in the case<br>
where a cast product is not coated, any commercialized<br>
silicone oils including dimethyl silicone may be used.<br>
However, in the case of coating, it sometimes becomes<br>
difficult to form a coating with good adhesion.<br>
Therefore dimethyl silicone is undesirable in some<br>
cases, although its acceptability depends on the<br>
coating amount to the die casting product. In such a<br>
case, it is preferable to select alkyl silicone oil<br>
having alkyl-aralkyl or a long chain alkyl group longer<br>
than dimethyl function.<br>
The amount of the component (c) of the abovementioned<br>
(1) is determined to be "15 parts by weight<br>
or less". The reason is that silicon itself or silicon<br>
decomposition products are deposited on the die surface<br>
to cause a bad effect on the shape of the cast product<br>
if it exceeds 15 parts by weight. In the case where<br>
the die is used at a low to middle temperature (lower<br>
than 250°C) , silicon oil is not necessary to formulate<br>
since additives having the lubricating property are<br>
added as the component (d). In the case of the use at<br>
a high temperature (250°C or higher) silicone oil,<br>
which is hard to be decomposed, should be formulated.<br>
owever, in terms of the cost, the addition amount of<br>
the silicone oil is preferable to be low. The additive<br>
having the lubricating property, which are the<br>
component (d), may include, for example, an organic<br>
molybdenum.<br>
(6) The additives having the lubricating property,<br>
which are the component (d) of the above (1), fortifies<br>
the lubricating property at a low to middle<br>
temperature. The additives may include, for examples,<br>
animal and plant fats such as rapeseed oil, soybean<br>
oil, coconut oil, palm oil, beef tallows oil, and lard;<br>
esters of monohydric alcohol or polyhydric alcohols<br>
with higher fatty acids such as fatty acid esters,<br>
coconut oil fatty acids, oleic acid, stearic acid,<br>
lauric acid, palmitic acid, and beef tallow fatty<br>
acids; organic molybdenum; oil-soluble soaps and oily<br>
waxes. The organic molybdenum is preferably, for<br>
example, MoDDC and MoDTC, but MoDDP and MoDTP are not<br>
preferable due to a possibility to cause reaction of<br>
aluminum and a phosphorus component. Examples of the<br>
oil-soluble soaps may include sulfonated salts, phinate<br>
salts, and salicylate salts of Ca or Mg. Organic acid<br>
metal salts can be exemplified, although the solubility<br>
is not satisfactory.<br>
(7) For the invention, the combinations of the<br>
above-mentioned solvent having the described viscosity<br>
and flash point with mineral oils and/or the synthetic<br>
oils may be four kinds; a solvent alone, a solvent in<br>
combination with mineral oils, a solvent in combination<br>
with a synthetic oils, and a solvent in combination<br>
with a mineral oil and a synthetic oil. The solvent is<br>
not limited to one kind and two or more kinds of<br>
solvents may be used in combination. But, petroleum<br>
type solvents are preferable from a viewpoint of health<br>
of workers. The above-mentioned mineral oils may<br>
include machine oils, turbine oils, spindle oils and<br>
cylinder oils. Synthetic esters can also be used.<br>
(8) In the invention, the flash point of the<br>
release agent is required to be from 70 to 170°C.<br>
Herein the lower limit value of 70°C is for lowering<br>
the risk of a fire. This value is higher than the<br>
flash point of kerosene(about 40°C), which was used in<br>
the old type release agents. Therefore, this enables<br>
to apply the oil type release agent to the automatic<br>
die casting process. The upper limit value of the<br>
flash point is determined to be 170°C because of the<br>
following reasons. That is, if mineral oils or<br>
synthetic oils with a high viscosity (that is high<br>
flash point) are used, the oil film adhering to the die<br>
cannot be dried out resulting in dripping off from the<br>
die surface. Due to the dripped-off oil portion, the<br>
adhesion efficiency on the die surface becomes worsen<br>
and ambient environments become worsen. Accordingly,<br>
to avoid the problem, the flash point should be 170°C<br>
or lower.<br>
(9) The dynamic viscosity of the release agent at<br>
40°C has to be 2 to 30 mm2/s. The reasons are as<br>
follows. If the dynamic viscosity is lower than<br>
2 mm^/s, pump wear increases at the time of applying<br>
the release agent. If it exceeds 30 mm^/s, pumping up<br>
of the agent at the time of application of the release<br>
agent becomes difficult resulting in instable. If the<br>
control becomes instable, application of 20 cc or less<br>
becomes difficult. If the control becomes difficult,<br>
spray amount of the release agent fluctuates every shot<br>
and accordingly stable castability cannot be<br>
maintained. The dynamic viscosity is more preferably<br>
in the range of 2 to 20 mm^/s for more stable spray<br>
amount and more finer mist formation.<br>
(10) The oil type release agent of the first<br>
invention has following merits against conventional<br>
water soluble type relase agents:<br>
1) The oil type release agent does not cause<br>
quenching reaction;<br>
2) The agent has a high heat resistance and antisoldering<br>
property;<br>
3) The agent prolongs the die life and contributes<br>
to no waste fluid disposal;<br>
4) The adhesion efficiency can be kept at an<br>
appropriate oil film thickness by the flash point<br>
adjustment from 70 to 170°C level. Thus the high<br>
21<br>
temperature lubricating property can be ensured;<br>
5) It makes possible to optimize spraying<br>
characteristics and minimize scattering of the agent in<br>
air by setting the dynamic viscosity at 40°C within a<br>
proper range from 2 to 30 mm2/s;<br>
6) It reduces die casting problems such as<br>
galling, and soldering by forming and uniform oil film<br>
on the die surface even the spray amount is small and<br>
the oil film is thin; and<br>
7) It also reduces a blister problem at the time<br>
of thermal treatment process for the die casting<br>
product because of thin oil film.<br>
(11) In the first invention, the spray amount of<br>
the release agent to the die is desirably 20 cc or<br>
less, more preferably 1 cc or less, and more preferably<br>
0.5 cc or less for every shot on the basis of the neat<br>
liquid. The reason for this is because if the spray<br>
amount exceeds 20 cc, it becomes difficult to carry out<br>
casting with no waste fluid generation, and the amount<br>
of the gas entrained in a cast product is high level<br>
resulting in high level of the porosity. As described,<br>
since the spray amount is 20 cc or less, waste liquidfree<br>
casting can be achieved. Also for the same<br>
reason, the gas entrainment in a cast product is<br>
decreased. Further, since neither powder nor wax is<br>
used, too much adhesion and solid accumulation on the<br>
die casting machine are prevented.<br>
 (12) The reason of the above-mentioned soldering<br>
is supposed to occur with too thin oil film between the<br>
cast product and the die surface. Particularly, the<br>
soldering occurs frequently in the projection parts<br>
just like core pins. Generally, it is said that the<br>
core pins are in portions where sprayed mist is less<br>
led and the oil film there becomes thinner than other<br>
portions. Additionally, if the continuous casting is<br>
started using the oil type release agent, the die<br>
gradually becomes hot because no external cooling<br>
function is with the agent. The adhesion amount of the<br>
release agent on the die surface decreases with the<br>
temperature increase, oil film is thermally<br>
deteriorates and thus the oil film becomes thinner. To<br>
solve such a problem, there are methods in which a<br>
wettability improving additive is added to increase the<br>
adhesion amount for fortifying the oil film or an<br>
antioxidant is added to retard the thermal<br>
deterioration of the oil film.<br>
Accordingly, in the first invention, it is<br>
preferable to add the wettability improving additive or<br>
antioxidants besides the respective components (a) to<br>
(d) of the above-mentioned (1). As the wettabilityimproving<br>
additive, for example, 0.1 to 3 parts by<br>
weight of acrylic copolymers or acryl-modifled<br>
polysiloxanes with the flash point of 100°C or lower<br>
may be added. In the above-mentioned range on the<br>
addition, the wettability improving additive has an<br>
adhesive effect although it is an agent for improving<br>
the wettability. Herein, if the wettability improving<br>
additive is added, the wettability of the release agent<br>
to the metal surface is improved resulting in the<br>
increase of adhesion amount on the metal surface.<br>
Especially, if the metal surface is quite hot, the<br>
phenomenon (Leidenfrost phenomenon) occurs. Because of<br>
this, that lightweight components of the release agent<br>
are bumped abruptly and oil mist droplets are kept from<br>
wetting the metal surface. Thus the film formation on<br>
the metal surface is inhibited. Since the wettability<br>
is improved due to the wettability improving additive,<br>
such a phenomenon is suppressed and the oil film is<br>
made thicker.<br>
(13) It is also preferable to add the<br>
antioxidants, 0.2 to 2 parts by weight in total of one<br>
or more kinds of antioxidants which are selected from a<br>
group consisting of amine type, phenol type and cresol<br>
type antioxidants. This component is added for<br>
preventing or retarding the oxidation deterioration at<br>
the time of high temperature operation, keeping the<br>
thickness of the oil film, ensuring the lubricating<br>
function, and inhibiting a soldering occurence.<br>
Examples of the above-mentioned amine type<br>
antioxidants are monoalkyldiphenylamine types such as<br>
monononyldiphenylamine; dialkyldiphenylamine types such<br>
as 4,4'-dibutylphenlamine, 4,4'-dipentyldiphenylamine,<br>
4,4'-dihexyldiphenylamine, 4,4'-diheptyldiphenylamine,<br>
4,4'-dioctyldiphenylamine, and 4,4'-<br>
dinonyldiphenylamine; polyalkyldiphenylamines such as<br>
tetrabutyldiphenylamine, tetrahexyldiphenylamine,<br>
tetraoctyldiphenylamine, and tetranonyldiphenylamine;<br>
a-naphthylamine, phenyl-a-naphthylamine,<br>
butylphenyl-a-naphthylamine, pentylphenyla-<br>
naphthylamine, hexylphenyl-a-naphthylamine,<br>
heptylphenyl-a-naphthylamine, and octylphenyl-anaphthylamine.<br>
Examples of the above-mentioned phenyl type<br>
antioxidants are 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol,<br>
2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-ethylphenol, 4,4-<br>
methylenebis(2,6-di-tert-butylphenol), 2,2-<br>
methylenebis(4-ethyl-6-butylphenol), high molecular<br>
weight mono-cyclic phenols, polycyclic tertbutylphenols,<br>
BHT (butylated hydroxy toluene), BHA<br>
(butylated hydroxy anisole). Examples of cresol type<br>
antioxidants are di-tert-butyl-p-cresol and 2,6-ditert-<br>
butyl-dimethylamino-p-cresol. Among the abovementioned<br>
antioxidants, mixtures of BHT with<br>
alkyldiphenylamines are preferable.<br>
In the invention, antirust agents, surfactants,<br>
preservers, defoaming agents, and other additives<br>
(e.g., extreme pressure additives, viscosity index<br>
improvers, cleaning dispersants, coloring agents, and<br>
fragrant agents) may be added properly.<br>
(14) In the invention, with respect to the abovementioned<br>
oil type release agent containing the<br>
respective components (a) to (d), after one to three<br>
optional components among these components are<br>
previously mixed to obtain a mixture and then the<br>
remaining components may be mixed with the mixture to<br>
obtain the release agent. Specifically, the components<br>
(b), (c), and (d) are previously mixed to obtain a<br>
mixture 1 and successively a user may mix the component<br>
(a) with the mixture 1 to form the release agent. Also<br>
the components (a) and (b) are mixed to obtain a<br>
mixture 2 and later a user may mix a mixture 3 of the<br>
components (c) and (d) with the mixture 2 to obtain the<br>
release agent.<br>
Also, among the five components including the<br>
respective components (a), (b), (c), and (d) and<br>
additionally a wettability improving additive or an<br>
antioxidant (defined as a component [e]), one to four<br>
optional components are previously mixed to obtain a<br>
mixture. And then the remaining components may be<br>
mixed with the previous mixture to obtain the release<br>
agent.<br>
(15) A low viscosity oil type release agent has<br>
many advantageous points. However it also has<br>
disadvantageous points due to a small amount spray of<br>
water free type agent. The die surface is not cooled<br>
externally. The die temperature fluctuation is slight<br>
in one cycle of die casting. And then the steady state<br>
is kept at a high temperature. Herein, if the<br>
temperature is about 350°C or lower, there is no<br>
problem at all and the advantageous points of the low<br>
viscosity oil type release agent can be utilized as<br>
they are. However, if the temperature is higher than<br>
that, soldering sometimes occurs between the cast<br>
product and the die, and it becomes difficult to carry<br>
out continuous casting. As another inferior point, it<br>
is sometimes required to reform a die system for<br>
reinforcing internal cooling for the oil type release<br>
agent where an oil type release agent is to be used for<br>
an already existing casting machine which is operated<br>
mainly in an external cooling manner by spraying a<br>
large amount of the water soluble type relase agent to<br>
a die. Further, for reasons relevant to the die<br>
structure or product shape, inner cooling is sometimes<br>
impossible. Therefore, it is desired to develop an oil<br>
type relase agent provided with a high temperature<br>
lubricating property and capable of dealing with the<br>
Leidenfrost problem without reforming the machine.<br>
A setting method of the solvent mixing ratio of<br>
the invention (the second invention) is carried out<br>
based on the above-mentioned background. That is, the<br>
second invention is the method for setting a mixing<br>
ratio of the above-mentioned solvent to avoid<br>
Leidenfrost phenomenon at the time of die casting using<br>
the oil type release agent of the first invention. Two<br>
or more kinds of solvents are used for the abovementioned<br>
solvent. The invention involves the first,<br>
second, third and fourth steps. The first step is to<br>
interpolate the expected highest use temperature (S) in<br>
the following equations (1) and (2) for calculating the<br>
flash point (F) of a release agent. The second step is<br>
to investigate the flash point for three or more<br>
different release agents having different<br>
concentrations of the respective solvents. The third<br>
step is to make a graph of the correlation of the %<br>
value by weight of the solvent in each release agent.<br>
The fourth step is to calculate the % value by weight<br>
of the solvent in the release agent to be formulated<br>
from the graph and the flash point calculated from the<br>
equations (I) and (2).<br>
S + 80 = L (1)<br>
L = 4.4 x F + 36 (2)<br>
where S denotes the highest temperature for use of a<br>
release agent; L denotes Leidenfrost phenomenon<br>
temperature; and F denotes the flash point of the<br>
release agent.<br>
The setting method of the solvent mixing ratio of<br>
the third invention is the method for setting the<br>
mixing ratio of the above-mentioned solvents with the<br>
above-mentioned mineral oil and/or synthetic oil to<br>
avoid Leidenfrost phenomenon at the time of die casting<br>
using the oil type release agent of the first<br>
invention. The invention involves the first, second,<br>
third and fourth steps. The first step is to<br>
interpolate the expected highest use temperature (S) in<br>
the above-mentioned equations (I) and (2) for<br>
calculating the flash point (F) of a release agent.<br>
The second step is to investigate the flash point for<br>
three or more different release agents having different<br>
concentrations of the respective solvents, mineral oils<br>
and/or synthetic oils. The third step is to make a<br>
graph of the correlation of the % value by weight of<br>
the solvent in each release agent. The fourth step is<br>
to calculate the % value by weight of the solvent in<br>
the release agent from the graph and the flash point<br>
calculated from the equations (1) and (2).<br>
(16) Next, the Leidenfrost phenomenon of the<br>
above-mentioned (15) is described below.<br>
When the oil type release agent is brought into<br>
contact with a hot die, lightweight hydrocarbon<br>
components in the agent bump abruptly. Those<br>
hydrocarbon components make a rising gas current and<br>
other parts of the hydrocarbon components are in the<br>
air as oil droplets. Because of the rising gas<br>
current, oil droplets float up from the die surface to<br>
worsen the contact of the droplets with the die<br>
surface. As a result, the heat is not transmitted to<br>
the oil droplets to make the evaporation speed slow<br>
down. Since active components of the oil droplets are<br>
inhibited from the adhesion on the die, the adhesion<br>
amount is decreased to worsen the releasing property.<br>
This phenomenon is called the Leidenfrost phenomenon<br>
and it has been known well in the case of water soluble<br>
type relase agents. This phenomenon occurs around 150<br>
to 200°C in the case of water soluble type relase<br>
agents, while the phenomenon occurs at 350°C or higher<br>
in the case of the oil type release agent invented.<br>
This was found based on the investigations carried out<br>
for the invention.<br>
The present inventors have investigated the<br>
temperature at which the Leidenfrost phenomenon occurs<br>
in an experimental scale. In addition, the inventors<br>
studied the highest use temperature in an actual die<br>
casting machine and the flash point of release agent.<br>
The results are shown in FIG. 7. As shown in FIG. 7,<br>
when the flash point rises, the Leidenfrost phenomenon<br>
temperature goes up and the highest useable temperature<br>
becomes higher in the actual machine. In this case,<br>
the temperature, at which the Leidenfrost phenomenon<br>
occurs, is defined as a point at which the evaporation<br>
speed becomes the slowest. But the evaporation speed<br>
is found to be retarded when the temperature is still<br>
lower before that point. That is, it can be said that<br>
at the temperature lower than the Leidenfrost<br>
30<br>
phenomenon temperature by about 80°C, the release agent<br>
reaches its practical use limit. From FIG. 7, the<br>
following correlation can be assumed:<br>
where S denotes the highest temperature for use of the<br>
oil type release agent (°C); L denotes the Leidenfrost<br>
phenomenon temperature (°C); and F denotes the flash<br>
point (°C) .<br>
As assumed from FIG. 7, if the Leidenfrost<br>
phenomenon point of the release agent is increased, the<br>
highest practical use temperature can be raised.<br>
Herein, there are two methods to increase the highest<br>
practical use temperature. A former method is to<br>
increase the flash point of the agent to confirm the<br>
practical application by using an actual machine. The<br>
latter method is to increase the Leidenfrost phenomenon<br>
temperature by increasing the flash point. However, a<br>
large scale experiment is required to confirm the<br>
practical applicability by using the actual machine.<br>
Since the method for measuring the Leidenfrost<br>
phenomenon temperature in the laboratory scale is<br>
easier, the latter method is employed. However, if the<br>
flash point is increased and the spray amount is<br>
increased too much, the fume becomes dense at the time<br>
of spray and therefore, it is required to carry out the<br>
experiments carefully.<br>
31<br>
Next, the measurement method of the Leidenfrost<br>
phenomenon temperature will be explained with reference<br>
to FIG. 8. For the measurement, the apparatus of<br>
FIG. 1 is employed as described in Takeo TAKASHIMA,<br>
Hiroshi SHIOTA, "Study on Evaporation of Oil-in-Water<br>
type Emulsion Droplets on Heated Face", Transactions (B<br>
edition) of The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers,<br>
Vol. 70, No. 700 (2004-12) No 03-1248.<br>
At first, a saucer 51 made of brass is put on a<br>
heater 52. The saucer has a cylindrical and saucerlike<br>
structure with a diameter of 60 mm, a height of<br>
30 mm, and a curvature radius R of 200 in the upper<br>
face, and a depth of 4 mm in the center. The saucer 51<br>
is covered with an insulator 53 and a transformer 54 is<br>
connected to the heater 52. A thermocouple 55 is<br>
embedded under the center in 2 mm depth of the saucer<br>
51 and connected with a temperature recorder 56.<br>
Further, a video camera 57 is installed for<br>
photographing the bumping state. Also, a release agent<br>
is put in a syringe 58 made of polyethylene and<br>
equipped with a thin tube. The tip end of the thin<br>
tube is set above the center of the saucer at 40 mm<br>
height. In this case, the diameter of a droplet 59 is<br>
about 2.7 mm. When the temperature of the saucer 51<br>
reaches a prescribed temperature, one droplet 59 at a<br>
room temperature is dripped. And then the evaporation<br>
time is measured by a stop watch. Also, the state of<br>
32<br>
the droplet is observed by the video camera 57. The<br>
above-mentioned observation is carried out at every<br>
10°C and the graph of the correlation between the<br>
temperature and the evaporation time is produced. The<br>
temperature, at which the evaporation time is the<br>
longest, is defined as Leidenfrost phenomenon<br>
temperature.<br>
(17) The above-mentioned release agent will be<br>
described more in detail. The oil type release agent<br>
is free from water, powder or emulsifier. It is<br>
understood that if no water is contained, the die is<br>
less cooled and the thermal fatigue is minimized and<br>
therefore the die life is remarkably improved. For<br>
example, according to a small die casting product<br>
obtained by using an actual die casting machine, repair<br>
and maintenance of the die are required every<br>
20000 times shot in the case of a water-soluble agent.<br>
However no repair of the die is required even after<br>
320000 times shot in the case of the oil type agent.<br>
And it is thus proved the life is at least 16 times as<br>
long. The economic effect is equivalent to the cost<br>
down of several million yen in the case of small scale<br>
of 350 ton machine. Further, since no water is used<br>
and small amount blowing is made possible, no waste<br>
fluid is discharged and the waste liquid treatment cost<br>
is also remarkably saved. Further, because a very<br>
small amount of spray, the smoke or fume is extremely<br>
decreased and the work environments are remarkably<br>
improved.<br>
Further, since the oil type release agent of the<br>
invention contains no emulsifier, which is<br>
indispensably employed for all water-soluble release<br>
agents. The oil type release agent is advantageous in<br>
the waste liquid treatment. The oil type release agent<br>
is also suitable for avoiding endocrine disrupting<br>
substance problems. Further, since the release agent<br>
of the invention contains no powder, the agent is also<br>
advantageous in suppression of the staining of<br>
apparatus, prevention of quality alteration of the<br>
release agent due to precipitation during storage, and<br>
retention of surface luster without damages on the<br>
surface of a cast product with a powder.<br>
(18) A casting method of the invention (the fourth<br>
invention) is for die casting by using the oil type<br>
release agent for the die casting of the first<br>
invention and the release agent spray unit. According<br>
to the invention, die casting is made possible by using<br>
the oil type release agent. FIG. 1A shows the front<br>
view of a movable die to be used in the invention and<br>
FIG. IB shows the front view of a fixed die part of the<br>
die to be used in the invention. The above-mentioned<br>
die is composed of the movable die 1 and the fixed die<br>
2 and the movable die I is provided with an upper slide<br>
3, a lower slide 4, and a movable core 5. The<br>
reference numeral 6 in the figure denotes a guide pins;<br>
the reference numeral 7 denotes surface pins; the<br>
reference numeral 8 denotes ejector pins for runners;<br>
and the reference numeral 9 denotes a fixed core.<br>
(19) A spraying system of the invention (the fifth<br>
invention) is a device for applying the oil type<br>
release agent for the die. This system comprises a<br>
spray unit provided with plural nozzle tubes for<br>
spraying the release agent to the die and a pressurized<br>
delivery unit to send the release agent to the spray<br>
unit which is used at a low pressure to apply a small<br>
amount of the release agent to the die. The spray<br>
system is provided with a spray unit 22 having a<br>
plurality of spray nozzles 21 as shown in FIG. 2. A<br>
tube 23 for air introduction into which air is<br>
introduced and a tube 24 for release agent introduction<br>
into which the oil type release agent for the die<br>
casting is introduced are connected with the spray unit<br>
22. A tank 25 for storing the oil type release agent<br>
is connected to the tube 24 for release agent<br>
introduction via a pressure reducing valve 26 for<br>
pressure sending the release agent and a pump 27 for<br>
pumping the release agent. The pressurized delivery<br>
unit comprises the tank 25, the reducing pressure valve<br>
26 for the release agent, the pump 27 for pumping the<br>
release agent, and a release agent pressure sending<br>
hose, which is not illustrated here. The reference<br>
numeral 29 in the drawing shows the die having a cavity<br>
part 28.<br>
(20) In the case where the above-mentioned oil<br>
type release agent is employed by the already existing<br>
spray system for a water soluble type relase agent,<br>
that is, a unit type spray system having a large number<br>
of nozzles, there has been the problems mentioned<br>
below:<br>
1) Since the oil type release agent has a higher<br>
viscosity than the water soluble type relase agent, the<br>
spraying amount per every nozzle is not well balanced;<br>
and<br>
2) Fine adjustment of the spraying amount is<br>
difficult.<br>
Thus, in the case where the oil type release agent<br>
is automatically applied to carry out die casting by<br>
using the already existing spray system for a water<br>
soluble type relase agent without reforming the system,<br>
problems such as galling, flow line, metal wave, and<br>
much gas remaining in a product (porosit) are<br>
frequently caused. To deal with these problems, it is<br>
required to evenly apply the release agent to the die.<br>
In the spray unit of the invention, spray unit<br>
comprises a spray unit main body, tubes for air<br>
introduction and tubes for release agent introduction.<br>
Each of air tubes and agent tubes is connected with the<br>
spray unit main body as a set of tubes, respectively.<br>
As a pair of multiple sets of tubes are arranged face<br>
to face at two or more points, so that the release<br>
agent from the spray nozzles can be sprayed evenly to<br>
the die.<br>
Spray unit 22 has a structure shown in FIG. 3.<br>
The reference numeral 31 in the drawing denotes a spray<br>
unit main body. Tubes 23a and 23b for air introduction<br>
branched from the tube 23 for air introduction are<br>
connected to both ends of the spray unit main body 31.<br>
Tubes 24a, and 24b for release agent introduction<br>
branched from the tube 24 for release agent<br>
introduction are connected to both sides of the spray<br>
unit main body 31. Accordingly, the set of the<br>
branched tubes 23a and 24a are arranged on the side of<br>
tubes 23b and 24b as a pair. In FIG. 3, the sets of<br>
tubes for air introduction and for release agent<br>
introduction are arranged on the opposite to each other<br>
at two points. However the pair of tubes may be<br>
arranged on the opposite to each other at three or more<br>
points.<br>
The reason is described below for the arrangement<br>
of the pair of tubes on the opposite to each other at<br>
two or more points is as follows.<br>
(21) The spray unit for the water-soluble release<br>
agent has a large number of spray nozzles having<br>
release agent application nozzles. Conventionally,<br>
there is only one set of a supply port (a tube for<br>
release agent introduction) and an air supply port (a<br>
tube for air introduction). In the case where the<br>
spray unit is employed for applying the oil type<br>
release agent without any modification, the release<br>
agent is applied more than necessity from the spray<br>
nozzle due to near position to the set of the supply<br>
port for the oil type release agent and air supply<br>
port. This is because a small amount of the oil type<br>
release agent is used and the viscosity of the oil type<br>
release agent is higher than that of water soluble type<br>
relase agent. On the other hand, the spray amount is<br>
less than necessity from the spray nozzles which are<br>
located at a remot portion from the introduction tubes<br>
and thus it is made impossible to evenly apply the oil<br>
type release agent to the die. Accordingly, a pair of<br>
the tubes sets for release agent introduction and for<br>
air introduction are arranged face to face at two or<br>
more points, so that pressure is applied evenly by the<br>
respective spray nozzles, and the oil type release<br>
agent and air are supplied evenly to the nozzles.<br>
Consequently, it is made possible to evenly apply a<br>
small amount of the oil type release agent for the die<br>
surface.<br>
In the spray system of the invention, the<br>
pressurizing delivery unit may comprise a tank for<br>
storing the oil type release and a delivery hose for<br>
in the tank is set between the upper limit position at<br>
the time when the spray nozzle is in waiting mode and<br>
the lower limit position at the time when the release<br>
agent is sprayed.<br>
(22) The pressurizing delivery unit 40 has a<br>
structure as shown in FIG. 4. The reference numeral 41<br>
in FIG. 4 shows the die casting machine. The movable<br>
die 1 and the fixed die 2 shown in FIG. 1 are arranged<br>
at a distance from each other in the die casting<br>
machine 41. The tank 25 storing the oil type release<br>
agent is connected to the spray unit 22 via a release<br>
agent pressure sending hose 42. Although not<br>
illustrated, a pressure reducing valve and a pump for<br>
pumping up the release agent show in FIG. 3 are<br>
installed in the tank 25. The spray unit 22 is made<br>
movable up and down by a supporting pole 43 which is<br>
movable up and down (in the direction shown as the<br>
arrow Y). The supporting pole 43 is guided by s<br>
supporting pole 44 mounted on a part of the die casting<br>
machine 41 and a transverse bar 45 joined to the<br>
supporting pole 44.<br>
Following are reasons why the top level of the<br>
agent face in the tank is set in the above-mentioned<br>
manner. That is, to apply a small amount of the oil<br>
type release agent, it is necessary to send the agent<br>
at a low pressure by the pump to the spray unit and the<br>
sending pressure of the oil type release agent is as<br>
extremely low as 0.02 to 0.05 MPa. Therefore, if a<br>
very small amount of air, which is mixed in the release<br>
agent, is sent together with the agent by pump, a<br>
rather large air layer, so-called air spot, is formed<br>
at the highest point in the tube. This air spot<br>
interrupts the flow of the release agent to lose the<br>
stability of the spraying amount. As a result, in a<br>
mass production of die casting products, the<br>
repeatability precision of the spray amount control of<br>
the release agent is worsened and the quality of die<br>
casting products is affected adversely.<br>
On the other hand, it is found that this spray<br>
control problem can be solved by setting as mentioned<br>
before. The top level of the agent face in the tank<br>
should be set between the upper limit position (the<br>
position is higher than the tank) L]_ at the time when<br>
the spray nozzles are in waiting mode and the lower<br>
limit position L.2 at the time when the release agent is<br>
sprayed (reference to FIG. 4). That is, during the<br>
time when the spray nozzles are set at the lower face<br>
position in the waiting mode, the pressure is increased<br>
corresponding to the liquid pressure (the height of the<br>
release agent) in relation to the tank position, the<br>
flow rate of the release agent is increased<br>
accordingly, and the accumulated air also becomes easy<br>
to flow to decrease the air spots. However, if the tip<br>
end position of the nozzles is set to be further lower<br>
than the above-mentioned position, the air flows out<br>
faster, but a large quantity of the release agent is<br>
also discharged. It causes a difficulty in applying a<br>
small amount of the agent. Accordingly, it is required<br>
to set the lower limit position. On the other hand,<br>
the pressure is low during the time of the waiting mode<br>
of the spray nozzles at the upper level position, so<br>
that the flow of the release agent is decreased and air<br>
hardly flows out of the tip of the nozzles. Further,<br>
when the nozzle is at higher than that, the liquid<br>
pressure of the release agent is lowered, finally the<br>
release agent tends to go back to the tank, and air is<br>
sometimes sucked from the tip of the nozzles. Because<br>
of that, the upper level position of the spray nozzles<br>
is also limited. The position of the tank for the<br>
release agent is set between the lower limit and the<br>
upper limit, so that small amount spray can be achieved<br>
and the air spot problem can be solved simultaneously.<br>
Further, it is made possible to supply the release<br>
agent to the spray unit by a minimum delivery pressure<br>
of the necessity. Owing to this effect, with respect<br>
to the spray amount, application in an amount as low as<br>
0.1 to 0.2 cc per one nozzle is made possible. And<br>
even and small amount spray to the die surface can be<br>
carried out.<br>
Hereinafter, Examples of the invention will be<br>
described. However, it is not intended that the<br>
invention be limited to the illustrated Examples.<br>

The flash point of each specimen was measured by<br>
Pensky-Martin method according to JIS-K-2265<br>
(D) Measurement method of dynamic viscosity<br>
The dynamic viscosity at 40°C was measured<br>
according to JIS-K-2283.<br>
(E) Measurement method of adhesion amount<br>
(E-l) Preparation<br>
As a specimen, an iron plate (SPCC,<br>
100 mm x 100 mm x 1 mm thickness) was baked at 200°C for<br>
30 minutes in an oven, cooled overnight in a<br>
desiccator, and the plate weight was measured to 0.1 mg<br>
order.<br>
(E-2) Spray of the oil type release agent<br>
The operation of the adhesion tester shown in<br>
FIG. 5 was as follows.<br>
44<br>
At first, an electric power source temperature<br>
adjustment apparatus 12 was set at a prescribed<br>
temperature and a stand 14 for holding a specimen was<br>
heated by a heater 13. Herein, when the first<br>
thermocouple 17 reached the set temperature, the iron<br>
plate 16 as a specimen was put on a metal fitting 15<br>
for supporting a specimen and the second thermocouple<br>
18 was brought into firm contact with the iron plate<br>
16. After that, when the temperature of the iron plate<br>
16 reached the prescribed temperature, a prescribed<br>
amount of each release agent 19 was automatically<br>
sprayed to the iron plate 16 by the spray 20. Then,<br>
the iron plate 16 was taken out and stood vertically in<br>
air for a fixed time, to allow an oil dripping off from<br>
the iron plate 16.<br>
(E-3) Measurement method of adhesion amount<br>
After keeping the iron plate 16 with coated<br>
ingredients in an oven at a prescribed temperature for<br>
a prescribed period, the plate was taken out. The<br>
plate was cooled by air, and further cooled in the<br>
desiccator for a prescribed period. After that, the<br>
weight of the iron plate 16 bearing the coated<br>
ingredients was measured up to 0.1 mg order. And<br>
the adhesion amount was calculated from the weight<br>
change of the iron plate considering a blank test<br>
result.<br>
 (E-4) Test condition<br>
Tester: Adhesion amount tester (manufactured by<br>
Yamaguchi Giken Co., Ltd.)<br>
Measurement conditions: as described in the<br>
following Table 2.<br>
Reference to FIGS. 6A to 6C. At first, a friction<br>
testing stand 2 (SKD-61 model, 200 mm x 200 mm x 34 mm)<br>
having a thermocouple 1 attached to an automatic<br>
pulling tester (trade name: Lub Tester U) manufactured<br>
by MEC International Co., Ltd. was heated to a<br>
prescribed temperature by a commercially available<br>
heater. Next, as shown in FIG. 6A, the testing stand 2<br>
was vertically stood and a release agent 4 was sprayed<br>
by a nozzle 3 under the conditions shown above in the<br>
adhesion test. Immediately after that, the testing<br>
stand 2 was horizontally put on the tester main body 5<br>
and a ring 6 (made of S45C, inner diameter 75 mm, outer<br>
diameter 100 mm, and height 50 mm) manufactured by MEC<br>
International Co., Ltd. was put on the center (refer to<br>
FIG. 6B). Successively, 90 cc of aluminum molten metal<br>
7 (ADC-12, at 670°C) , which was melted at a melting<br>
furnace for a ceramic art use, was poured into the ring<br>
6. The molten metal was cooled for 40 seconds to be<br>
solidified. Further, an 8.8 kg weight 8 made of iron<br>
was immediately and calmly put on the solidified<br>
aluminum (ADC-12). Then, the ring 6 was pulled in the<br>
direction shown as the arrow X by a gear of the tester<br>
to measure the friction force (refer to FIG. 6C).<br>
(F-2) Friction force measurement conditions<br>
The friction force measurement conditions were as<br>
shown in the following Table 3.<br>
The test results were shown in Table 1 on flash<br>
point, dynamic viscosity, adhesion amount (300°C), and<br>
friction force at 300°C and 350°C for the abovementioned<br>
Examples and Comparative Examples.<br>
It is confirmed by the tester manufacturer that<br>
the results have an excellent correlation with those<br>
carried out by actual die casting machines. 10 Kgf<br>
value in the tester corresponds to an allowable maximum<br>
level of the releasing property in the actual machines.<br>
A higher value than 10 Kgf in the tester suggests<br>
troubles such as soldering and galling in the actual<br>
machines.<br>
According to the results of the functional<br>
comparative test, the oil type release agents of<br>
Examples 1 to 5 were found having higher adhesion<br>
amounts, lower friction forces and better releasing<br>
capability than the water soluble type relase agents of<br>
Comparative Examples 1 to 3. Also, even at a high<br>
temperature of 350°C, at which the soldering occurred<br>
with water soluble type relase agents, the oil type<br>
release agents were found having sufficiently excellent<br>
releasing capability.<br>
(II) Examples 6 to 11 and Comparative Examples 4 to 7<br>
Hereinafter, release agents of Examples 6 to 11<br>
containing a wettability improving additive will be<br>
described with reference to release agents of<br>
Comparative Examples 4 to 7.<br>
(A) Components and test results<br>
The following Table 4 shows components physical<br>
values, results of adhesion test, and results of<br>
friction force test of the oil type release agents of<br>
Examples 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. The following Table 5<br>
shows physical values, components, results of adhesion<br>
test, and results of friction test for the oil type<br>
release agents of Comparative Examples 4, 5, and 6 and<br>
the water soluble type relase agent (trade name:<br>
Lubrolene A-1609, manufactured by AOKI SCIENCE<br>
INSTITUTE Co., Ltd.) of Comparative Example 7.<br>
*1: Trade name: EFKA-3236 modified polysiloxane,<br>
manufactured by Wilbur-Ellis Company<br>
*2: Trade name: EFKA-3778 acrylic copolymer,<br>
manufactured by Wilbur-Ellis Company<br>
Others components are the same as those shown<br>
*1 and *2 are the same as those shown in<br>
Table 4. The other components are the same<br>
as those shown in Table 1.<br>
*3: A water soluble type relase agent and the<br>
balance, 0.05% by weight, was a wax, an<br>
emulsifier or the like.<br>
 (B) Production method<br>
Same as described in Example 1, except that the<br>
wettability improving additives were mixed before the<br>
solvents were added.<br>
(C) Measurement method of flash point<br>
The measurement was carried out by Cleveland Open<br>
method for Example 9 and Comparative Example 6, and by<br>
Pensky-Martin method for Examples 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11<br>
and Comparative Examples 4 and 5.<br>
(D) Measurement method of dynamic viscosity<br>
Same as described in Example 1.<br>
(E) Measurement method of adhesion amount<br>
The preparation and measurement of the adhesion<br>
amount were the same as described in Example 1, and the<br>
testing conditions were as shown in the following<br>
 (F) Measurement method of friction force<br>
The friction force test method was the same as<br>
Example 1 and the friction force measurement conditions<br>
were the same as described in Table 3.<br>
 (G) Collective results of the measurement (Effect of<br>
wettability improving additive)<br>
In comparison of Example 6 (containing the<br>
wettability improving additive) with Comparative<br>
Example 4 (without the wettability improving additive);<br>
Example 7 (containing the wettability improving<br>
additive) with Comparative Example 5 (without the<br>
wettability improving additive); and Example 8<br>
(containing the wettability improving additive) with<br>
Comparative Example 6 (without the wettability<br>
improving additive), the wettability improving<br>
additives were found considerably increasing the<br>
adhesion amounts and lowering the friction force.<br>
Release agents cannot necessarily be sprayed<br>
evenly to die surface of actual machine. There are<br>
some concealed die portions which are wetted with a<br>
small amount of oil droplets, in which cases excellent<br>
releasing property can be exhibited by the release<br>
agents of Examples 6 to 11 with which show a high<br>
ability in the adhesion amount. The wettability<br>
improving additives are effective not only in the<br>
release agents of Examples 6, 7, 8, and 10 having<br>
viscosity in the range of 3 to 5 mm^/s. In addition,<br>
the additives are also effective in the release agent<br>
of Example 9 with viscosity as high as 24 mm2/s. The<br>
water soluble type relase agent of Comparative Example<br>
7 for reference has friction force of 10 kgf at 300°C,<br>
53<br>
which is a limit for use, while the oil type release<br>
agents have friction force in the range of 1 to 3 at<br>
300°C kgf and they are usable.<br>
The release agents of the invention containing the<br>
wettability improving additives are effective to<br>
increase the adhesion amount on the die surface.<br>
Sometimes, the release agent mist is hardly spread to<br>
result in occurrence of soldering at fine parts of the<br>
die. The release agent having high adhesion property<br>
is highly possibly to avoid such a problem. It can be<br>
said that the oil type release agents of the invention<br>
are excellent from this point of view. Also, since the<br>
adhesion efficiency is high, the release agents are<br>
usable in a small amount without making the adhered oil<br>
film thick. They are also usable as release agents<br>
with low viscosity and excellent in spraying property<br>
even if diluted with the above-mentioned component (a).<br>
(Example 12)<br>
Next, the spray unit for evenly applying the oil<br>
type release agents of the invention will be described.<br>
The unit is as explained above. The casting qualities<br>
were compared in Example 12 by using an actual machine.<br>
The following Table 7 shows the properties of<br>
products obtained by aluminum die casting using the<br>
release agents of Examples 13 to 16 and Comparative<br>
Examples 8 and 9 and the above-mentioned spray unit.<br>
In this case, the release agent of Example 4 was used<br>
for Examples 13 and 14; the release agent of Example 6<br>
was used for Examples 15 and 16; the release agent of<br>
Comparative Example 7 was used for Comparative Example<br>
8; and the release agent of Comparative Example 4 was<br>
used for Comparative Example 9. As shown in FIG. 1,<br>
the die employed in Example 12 was able to make two<br>
products at the same time and had a casting structure<br>
composed of upper and lower slides in a cavity part<br>
which was formed with movable and fixed dies.<br>
The spray of the oil type release agent to the<br>
cavity section was carried out by attaching the spray<br>
unit of the invention to an automatic spray unit.<br>
Also, exclusive spray unit (shown in FIG. 3) and a<br>
pressurizing delivery unit (shown in FIG. 4) were used<br>
for oil type release agents. Further, the release<br>
agents were pumped up by a pump and sent at a low<br>
pressure of 0.02 to 0.05 MPa to the spray unit. The<br>
oil type release agents were sprayed by air used in a<br>
plant and applied in a small amount to the die surface.<br>
*2: Employing spray unit for water-soluble release agent + pressurized delivery unit<br>
shown in FIG. 4.<br>
*3: Employing spray unit for water-soluble release agent + spray unit shown<br>
in FIG. 3 + pressurized delivery unit shown in FIG. 4.<br>
*4: Employing wettability improving agent and spray unit for water-soluble<br>
release agent.<br>
*5: Employing spray unit apparatus for water-soluble release agent.From the results shown in Table 7, the release<br>
agents (the former) of Examples 13 to 16 were found to<br>
be better or excellent in following points as compared<br>
with the release agents (the latter) of Comparative 8<br>
and 9:<br>
1) Excellent releasing performances of galling,<br>
soldering, flow line, metal wavy and occurrence of burr<br>
presumably due to excellent spreading property of the<br>
agent;<br>
2) Less porosity in the die casting product;<br>
3) Small spray amount which contributes to short<br>
spraying time;<br>
4) Excellent controllability of the delivery<br>
pressure which results in stable spray amount per each<br>
nozzle;<br>
5) Less daily work in controlling spray amount<br>
because of less fluctuation of the spraying amount;<br>
6) Same or better in the necessity of daily<br>
maintenance, retention of size precision, and<br>
occurrence of cracking in dies; and<br>
7) Excellent in the maintenance of dies and<br>
precision.<br>
It is not intended that the invention be limited<br>
to the above illustrated embodiments. Modifications<br>
and substitutions to specific process conditions and<br>
constitutional components can be made without departing<br>
from the spirit and scope of the invention. For<br>
58<br>
example, in the above Examples, although the tube for<br>
air introduction and the tube for release agent<br>
introduction are arranged face to face at two points,<br>
these tubes may be installed face to face at three or<br>
more points. In this connection, it is desired that<br>
these tubes are arranged on the opposite to each other<br>
as evenly as possible. With arrangement in such a<br>
manner, the release agent can be sprayed more evenly to<br>
the die from the tip ends of spray nozzles. The wavy<br>
patterns, gas amount left in a product, and application<br>
amount can be improved.<br>
In the above-mentioned Example 12, the tip end<br>
position of the oil face in the tank at the time of<br>
stopping spraying is set between the upper face<br>
position at the time when the spray nozzles are in<br>
waiting mode and the lower limit position at the time<br>
when the release agent is sprayed by the spray nozzles.<br>
However, it is not limited as described in this<br>
Example. The tank for the release agent may not be<br>
installed between the positions and the tip end<br>
position 13 of the oil face of the release agent may be<br>
set at the position by applying the pressure. With<br>
such conditioning, in the case where the release agent<br>
is not sprayed, the stopping position (rising limit) of<br>
the spray unit is above the oil surface position and<br>
therefore, the release agent does not drip. On the<br>
other hand, in the case where the release agent is<br>
59<br>
going to be applied, since the spray units are stopped<br>
at stopping position, which is the lower limit of spray<br>
unit, the pressure is sufficient for causing<br>
spontaneous drip of the oil type relase agent.<br>
Accordingly, no air spot is formed in hydraulic hoses<br>
and spraying of the oil type relase agent by air<br>
pressure in a plant can be carried out evenly with<br>
suppressed unevenness.<br>
(Ill) Example 17 and Comparative Examples 10 and 11<br>
Hereinafter, Example 17 will be described together<br>
with Comparative Examples 10 and 11.<br>
(A) Components and test results<br>
The following Table 8 shows the components, mixing<br>
ratios, and test results of oil type release agents of<br>
Example 17 and Comparative Examples 10 and 11.<br>
Trade name: Lasmit BHT, manufactured by<br>
Daiichi Kogyo Seiyaku Co., Ltd.<br>
Trade name: HiTEC-569, manufactured by<br>
Afton Chemical and the other components are<br>
the same as those shown in Table 1.<br>
Impossible to measure since solidified<br>
aluminum did not slide on the test stand and<br>
deposited.<br>
61<br>
(B) Production method<br>
The production was carried out as described in<br>
Example 6, except that the antioxidant was used in<br>
place of the wettability improving additive of<br>
Example 6.<br>
(C) Measurement of flash point<br>
The flash point of each agent was measured in the<br>
same manner as described in Example 1.<br>
(D) Measurement of dynamic viscosity<br>
The dynamic viscosity of each agent was measured<br>
in the same manner as described in Example 1.<br>
(E) Laboratory oxidation test, ROBT method<br>
According to JIS-K-2514, each agent was sampled<br>
into a closed type rotary pump and oxygen gas was then<br>
sealed. Oxidation was carried out at 150°C and the<br>
time taken to abruptly decrease oxygen pressure was<br>
measured.<br>
(F) Measurement method of friction force<br>
The testing method of friction force and the<br>
measurement conditions were the same as described in<br>
Example 1.<br>
(G) Collective results of measurement (Effect of<br>
antioxidant)<br>
In Example 17 and Comparative Examples 10 and 11,<br>
the flash point (°C) , the dynamic viscosity (mm^/s) at<br>
40°C, the laboratory oxidation test, the laboratory<br>
friction force test at 350°C and 400°C, and measurement<br>
of continuous castability using an actual die casting<br>
machine were carried out to find the results as shown<br>
in Table 8.<br>
In comparison of the results of Example 17<br>
(containing antioxidant) with those of Comparative<br>
Example 11 (containing no antioxidant), from a<br>
viewpoint of the laboratory test, the measured value<br>
(deterioration time) of Comparative Example 11 was<br>
240 minutes, meanwhile it was 890 minutes for Example<br>
17, showing durability as much as about 4 times and<br>
less deterioration. Accordingly, in the case of<br>
Example 17, it was confirmed that the antioxidants<br>
suppressed the oxidation deterioration of the oil type<br>
release agent.<br>
From a viewpoint of the friction force test, the<br>
friction force of Comparative Example 11 was 5 kgf at<br>
350°C, which is sufficiently low for practical use.<br>
However the agent caused soldering at 400°C and<br>
deposited. On the other hand, in Example 17, the<br>
friction force is as low as 9 kgf even at 400°C. The<br>
agent was found apparently excellent in the high<br>
temperature lubricating property as compared with the<br>
agent of Comparative Example 11. Accordingly, in the<br>
case of Example 17, it was confirmed that the<br>
antioxidant showed the effect and prevented the<br>
soldering.<br>
According to the above mentioned two kinds of<br>
experiments, it is assumed that the antioxidants can<br>
delay the oxidation deterioration of the components of<br>
the oil type release agent at a high temperature.<br>
Because of this delay, the antioxidants contribute to<br>
retention of the oil film thickness. Thus the friction<br>
resistance is kept at low level because of the thick<br>
oil film.<br>
On one hand, when the release agent of Comparative<br>
Example 11 was evaluated using an actual die casting<br>
machine, the soldering occurred at the 10th time to<br>
make continuous casting impossible. In the case of<br>
Example 17, continuous casting could be continued 220<br>
or more times. As a result, it was confirmed that the<br>
antioxidants contributed to decrease of soldering and<br>
increase of the times of the continuous casting. In<br>
the case of the actual machine employed for this case,<br>
the temperature of the core pin was 410°C immediately<br>
after the product was taken out. However, in the case<br>
of combination of the actual machine and Comparative<br>
Example 11, the continuous casting at 380°C was the<br>
limit. According to the results, it can be said that<br>
addition of the antioxidant improves the durability to<br>
30 degree higher side.<br>
Further, to ensure the lubricating property at low<br>
to middle temperature areas, the organic molybdenum was<br>
added in Example 17 and Comparative Example 11. On the<br>
other hand, no organic molybdenum was added in<br>
Comparative Example 10. The oxidation stability of<br>
Comparative Example 11 was slightly improved as<br>
compared with that of Comparative Example 10. Friction<br>
at 350°C was slightly decreased in the laboratory<br>
friction test. The number of casting times was<br>
slightly increased. Accordingly, the results showed<br>
the organic molybdenum had an auxiliary effect on<br>
oxidation prevention. However the effect was not so<br>
much significant as compared with those of phenol type<br>
or amine type antioxidants.<br>
(Example 18)<br>
Hereinafter, a method of setting mixing ratio of a<br>
solvent according to the second invention will be<br>
described.<br>
As being made clear from FIG. 7, the flash point<br>
of a release agent can be changed easily to adjust the<br>
Leidenfrost phenomenon temperature. The investigations<br>
carried out by the inventors for accomplishing the<br>
invention made it clear that there are correlations of<br>
the Leidenfrost phenomenon temperature L with the flash<br>
point F (reference to the equation (1)) and the highest<br>
use temperature (S) (reference to the equation (2)) of<br>
oil type release agents. The correlations may be<br>
defined as follows:<br>
1) The Leidenfrost phenomenon temperature L was<br>
calculated by interpolating an expected value of the<br>
highest use temperature S in the equation (1). And<br>
then the calculated temperature L was interpolated in<br>
the equation (2) to calculate the flash point F<br>
required for the oil type release agent.<br>
2) Next, three types of release agents (specimen<br>
I, specimen 2, specimen 3) were produced by changing<br>
mixing ratios of the solvent and mineral oils in the<br>
compositions. The Table 9 shows the components and<br>
flash points of those three specimens. The recommended<br>
mixing ratios were 80%, 70%, and 60% of the solvent.<br>
3) After that, the flash points of these three<br>
kinds of release agents were measured and as shown in<br>
FIG. 9, a graph was produced for the correlation of the<br>
solvent (%) and the flash point.<br>
4) Further, the needed solvent (% by volume) was<br>
calculated using the flash point (F) which was<br>
calculated as described in 1) from the graph.<br>
5} Next, a light component (the low viscosity<br>
mineral oil and/or the synthetic oil) was calculated<br>
from the balance calculated by subtracting the ratios<br>
of the solvent and the additive.<br>
In the manner as described above, in Example 18,<br>
the mixing ratio of the solvent and the mineral oil was<br>
properly set to avoid the Leidenfrost phenomenon.<br>
In Example 18, the case of using the solvent and<br>
mineral oil was described. However the invention may<br>
include the case of using a solvent and a synthetic<br>
oil; or the case of using a solvent, a mineral oil, and<br>
a synthetic oil; or the case of using two kinds of<br>
solvents.<br>
In the above-mentioned Example, the oil type<br>
release agent was described based on the first<br>
invention. However the combination of the respective<br>
components, mixing ratios and spray condition may<br>
properly be set to use the following oil type release<br>
agent. That is, the oil type release agent contain 50<br>
parts by weight or more in total of 1 or more kinds of<br>
components selected from a group consisting of<br>
solvents, mineral oils, synthetic oils, fats and oils,<br>
aliphatic acids, and aliphatic acid esters, 40 parts by<br>
weight or less of silicone oil, and additives having<br>
lubricating function, has the flash point of 50 to<br>
250°C and dynamic viscosity of 2 to 50 mm2/s at 40°C.<br>
With such a constitution, quenching is not caused<br>
unlike a conventional case and the agent as the oil<br>
type relase agent has high heat resistance scarcely<br>
causes soldering, resulting in possibility of<br>
prolongation of the die life. Also, the use of such an<br>
oil type release agent makes it possible to form an<br>
even and thin film on the die surface with a small<br>
amount, galling and soldering of the die casting<br>
product on the die and blistering at the time of<br>
thermal treatment can be suppressed. The types and<br>
properties of the respective components are as<br>
described in the case of the above-mentioned oil type<br>
release agents.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>

suitable for lubricating die surfaces by spraying a<br>
lubricant during die casting and for lubricating<br>
plunger chips at the time of pouring molten metal. The<br>
