LAUNDRY. TREATMENT COMPOSITIONS<br>
HINDUSTAN   LEVER   LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at   Hindustan   Lever  House,      165/166,   Backbay  Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

GRANTED<br><br>
LAUNDRY TREATMENT COMPOSITIONS TECHNICAL FI5LD<br>
The present invention relates to laundry treatment compositions  which  comprise dye which is  substantive  to cotton.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
Dyes have been included in laundry treatment products for many years.  Perhaps the oldest use of dyes is to add a substantive coloured dye to coloured clothes which require rejuvenation of colour for example a substantive blue dye for rejuvenation of denim.  These compositions usually contain a relatively, high concentration of substantive dye. More recently non-substantive dyes have also been used to colour otherwise white laundry detergent compositions.  In the case of particulate detergents this has been in the form of so-called speckles to add colour to an otherwise white powder, however laundry detergent powders which are completely blue are also known.  When dyes have been included in laundry treatment products in this way it was regarded as essential that non-substantive dyes were used to prevent undesired staining of washed fabrics.<br>
It is also known that a small amount of blue or violet dye impregnated into an otherwise 'white' fabric can appear to. have enhanced whiteness as described in Industrial  Dyes (K.Hunger ed Wiley-VCH 2003).  Modern white fabrics are sold with some dye in their material in order to enhance the<br><br>
whiteness at the point of sale of the garment.  This dye is often blue or violet though other colours are used.  However once these garments are worn and subsequently washed with a detergent composition the dye is rapidly removed from the 5  fabric often due to dissolution by a surfactant solution. Dye is also lost by reaction with bleach in the wash and fading due to light.  This results in a gradual loss of whiteness in addition to any other negative whiteness effects such as soiling.  In many cases this leads to the 10  appearance of a yellow colour on the cloth.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a laundry treatment composition according to claim 1.<br>
15  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Unless otherwise stated, all percentages or parts are on a weight basis.<br>
20  Laundry treatment compositions<br>
The present invention relates to compositions which are used to treat laundry items such as clothes.  Such compositions are preferably laundry detergent compositions used for<br>
25  washing (especially particulate detergents, liquid<br>
detergents, laundry bars, pastes, gels or tablets), laundry fabric conditioners used for softening fabrics, pre-treatment products, post-treatment products, tumble dryer products, ironing products etc.  Preferably they are laundry<br>
30  treatment products which are applied in an aqueous environment.<br><br>
The dyes may be incorporated into the treatment products in a wide variety of ways.  For example dyes which are not sensitive to heat may be included in the slurry which is to be spray dried when the treatment product is a particulate 5  detergent composition.  Another way of incorporating dyes into particulate detergent products is to add them to granules which are post-added to the main detergent powder. In this case there may be a concentration of dye in the granules which could present the danger of spotting and dye 10  damage on the clothes to be treated.  This can be avoided if the concentration of dye in the granules is less than 0.1%. For liquid products the dyes are simply added to the liquid and blended in substantially homogeneously.<br>
15  Because the dyes are substantive, only a small amount is required to provide the enhanced whiteness effect hence preferably the treatment composition comprises from 0.0001 to 0.1 wt%, preferably from 0.0005 to 0.05 wt% of the dye, more preferably from 0.001 to 0.01 wt%, most preferably from<br>
20  0.002 to 0.008 wt%.<br>
The dyes<br>
The photostable dyes of the present invention are unusual in 25  that they are substantive to cotton.  It is preferred that the dye has a substantivity to cotton, in a standard test of greater than 7%, preferably.from 8 to 80%, more preferably from 10 to 60%, most preferably from 15 to 40%, wherein the standard test is with a dye concentration such that the 30  solution has an optical density of approximately 1 (5 cm pathlength). at the maximum absorption of the dye in the<br><br>
visible wavelengths (400-700nm), a surfactant concentration of 0.3 g/L and under wash conditions of a liquor to cloth ratio of 45:1, temperature of 20°C, soak times of 45 minutes, agitation time of 10 minutes.  Higher 5  substantivities are preferred as this means less dye must be added to the formulation to achieve the effect.  This is preferred for reasons of cost and also because excess levels of dye in the formulation can lead to an unacceptable level of dye colour in the wash liquor and also in the powder. 10<br>
A photostable dye is a dye which does not quickly photodegrade in the presence of natural summer sunlight.  A photostable dye in the current context may be defined as a dye which, when on cotton, does not degrade by more than 10%<br>
15  when subjected to 1 hour of irradiation by simulated Florida<br>
2	2<br>
sunlight (42 W/m in UV and 343 W/m in visible).<br>
It is preferable that the dyes have a blue and/or violet shade.  This can mean that the peak absorption frequency of<br>
20  the dyes absorbed on the cloth lies within the range of from 540nm to 650nm, preferably from 570nm to 630nm.  This effect can advantageously be achieved by a combination of dyes, each of which not necessarily having a peak absorption within these preferred ranges but together produce an effect<br>
25  on the human eye which is equivalent to a single dye with a peak absorption within one of the preferred ranges.<br>
Organic dyes are described in Industrial Dyes (K.Hunger ed Wiley-VCH 2003) .  A compilation of available dyes is the 30  Colour Index published by Society of Dyer and Colburists and American Association of Textile Chemists and-Colorists 2002<br><br>
(see http://www.colour-index.org).  Suitable dyes for the current application may be taken from any of the chromophore types, e.g. azo, anthraquinone, triarylmethane, methine quinophthalone, azine, oxazine thiazine.  It is preferred 5  that the dye does not contain a reactive group such as found in procion and remazol dyes.  Due to the wider range available azo, anthraquinone and triarylmethane dyes are preferred.  Azo dyes are especially preferred.<br>
0  Dyes are conventionally defined as being reactive, disperse, direct, vat, sulphur, cationic, acid or solvent dyes.  For the purposes of the present invention, acid and/or direct dyes are preferred.<br>
5  For use in products which contain predominately anionic<br>
surfactants, dyes containing acid groups are preferred. • For use in products which contain predominantly cationic surfactants, dyes containing basic groups are preferred. This is to prevent precipitation between the dye and<br>
0  surfactant.<br>
Suitable dyes for use in products containing predominately anionic surfactants include those listed in the Colour Index as Direct Violet Dyes (e.g. Direct Violet 1-108), Direct 5  Blue dyes, Acid Blue and Acid Violet dyes.<br>
Suitable dyes for use in products containing predominately cationic surfactants include those listed in the Colour Index as Basic Blue and Basic Violet Dyes.<br><br>
To avoid shade changes caused by pick or loss of a proton it is preferred that the dye does not have a pKa or pKb at or near the pH of the product.  Most preferably no pKa or pKb in the pH range of from 7 to 11. 5<br>
It is preferred that the dye has a high extinction coefficient, so that a small amount of dye gives a large amount of colour.  Preferably the extinction coefficient at the maximum absorption of the dye is greater than 1000 mol"1 10  L cm"1, preferably greater than 10,000 mol"1 L cm"1, more preferably greater than 50,000 mol"1 L cm"1.<br>
Suitable dyes can be obtained from any major supplier such as Clariant, Ciba Speciality Chemicals, Dystar, Avecia or 15  Bayer.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Examale 1<br>
5  To determine the substantivity of a range of dyes the<br>
following experiment was performed.  A stock solution of 1.5g/L of a base washing powder in water was created.  The washing powder contained 18% NaLAS, 73% salts (silicate, sodium tri-poly-phosphate, sulphate, carbonate), 3% minors<br>
10  including perborate, fluorescer and enzymes, remainder<br>
impurities and water.  The solution was divided into 60mi aliquots and dye added to this to give a solution of optical density of approximately 1 (5 cm pathlength) at the maximum absorption of the dye in the visible lengths, 400-700nm. The<br>
15  optical density was measured using a UV-visible<br>
spectrometer.  1 piece of bleached, non-mercerised, non-fluorescent woven cotton cloth (ex Phoenic Calico) weighing 1.3g was placed in the solution at room temperature (20°C). This cloth represents a slightly yellow cotton.  The cloth<br>
20  was left to soak for 45 minutes then the solution agitated for 10 mins, rinsed and dried.  Following this the optical density of the solution was re-measured and the amount of dye' absorbed by the.cloth calculated.  This experiment was repeated for each dye and A   replicates were done per dye.<br>
25<br>
The dyes used and the % deposition is given in table 1. Table 2 gives the maximum extinction coefficient, Emsx,   in the wash solution and the peak absorption wavelength in solution and on cotton.  All values are reported to 2 significant figures.<br><br>
 Table  1<br><br><br>
Table  2 5<br><br>
Example 2<br><br>
10<br><br>
The experiment of example was repeted except -he rhe level in the vash solution was decreased to 1/10'", so that<br>
the optical density was 0.1 (5 cm path length;, 'following the washes the Gar.; whiteness of the cloth was measured (see "assessment cf witeness and Tint of fluorescent Substrates with Good Interinstrument Correlation" Colour Research  and Application  19, 19  .  The results are displayed in table 3, the ganz whitenss values are accurate to +/-5 units. Large increase in the measured Ganz whiteness are found for<br>
the substantive blue and violet dyes with λm£X on cotton in the range 570 to 640.<br><br>
15  Table 3<br><br>
Acid black 1, direct blue 1, direct violet 51, direct blue 71 and acid violet 17 gave the greatest increase in Ganz 20  whiteness.<br>
Direct violet 51 and direct blue 71 gave a higher Ganz whiteness value than direct blue 1 and they have the further<br><br>
advantage over direct blue 1 that they are not metabolised in the body to give carcinogenic amine, unlike the huge number of direct blue and violet dyes (e.g. direct blue 1) which contain moieties which breakdown to  give the 5  carcinogenic benzidine, 3,3'dimethoxybenzidine or 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine.  These dyes also have an advantage over many direct violet dyes' which contain transition metals that are hazardous to the environment and to humans.<br>
10  Preferred direct eyes fall into two groups: The first group comprises tris-azo direct blue dyes based on the structure:<br><br>
15  where at least two of the ?.,   B and C napthyl rings are subsituted by a sulphonate group. The C ring may be substituted at the 5 position by an NH2 or NHPh group,  X is a benzyl or napthyl ring substituted with upto 2 sulphonate groups and may be substituted at '2 position with a OH group<br>
20  and may also be substituted with an NH2 or NHPh group.<br>
Non-limiting examples of these dyes are direct blue 34, 70, 71, 72, 75, 73, 82, 120.<br>
25  The second group comprises bis-azo direct violet dyes based on the structure<br><br><br>
where Z is H cr phenyl. The A ring is preferably substituted by a methyl and methoxy croup et the positions indicated by arrows.The A ring may elso be a naphthyl ring. The Y group 5  is a benzyl or raphthyi ring, which is substituted by<br>
sulphate croup .are may be mono or disubstituted by methyl groups.<br>
Non-limiting examples of these dyes are direct violet 5, 7, 10  11, 31, 51.  The invention also comprises compositions including a single dye of the structure of the first or second group,' or mixtures thereof, the dye or mixture having the defined peak absorption wavelenqth.<br>
15  Example 3<br>
The experiment of example 1 was repeated except using dyes at lower conre.-.tra'tic.-.s, such that the optical density (5cm) was approximately 0.05 and 0.025 giving faintly coloured 20  wash liquors (i.e. using dye levels 1/20 and l/40th of<br>
experiment 1).  Following washing and drying the increase in whiteness was measured by a reflectometer and expressed in Ganz units.  The Gar.z values are accurate to +/- 5 units. The results are shown in the Table 3 below.<br><br>
 Table 4<br><br>
Direct blue 71 gave the best results. 5<br>
Example A<br>
Example 3 was repeated but using the blue dye Acid Black 1, the red dyes Acid Red 88 and Acid Red 150, and mixtures 0  thereof.  The results are shown in the tables below.<br>
Table 5<br><br><br>
Table 6<br><br>
Dye Mixture	Ganz whiteness<br>
control	154<br>
(A)+(C)	173<br>
(A)+(D)	175<br>
(A)+0.5(D)	171<br>
(A)+(E)	176<br>
(A)+(F)	175<br>
(A)+0.5(F)	169<br>
The results show that mixtures of red and blue dyes gives a 5  greater increase in whiteness than either alone. This is because the mixture produces a violet shade.<br><br>
