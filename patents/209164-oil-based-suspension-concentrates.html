COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"OIL-BASED SUSPENSION CONCENTRATES"<br>
BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a body corporate organised under the laws of Germany, of D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to new, oil-based suspension concentrates of agro-chemical active compounds, a process for the preparation of these formulations and their use for the application of the active compounds contained.<br>
Numerous anhydrous suspension concentrates of agrochemical active compounds have already been disclosed. Thus, EP-A 0 789 999 describes formulations of this type which, in addition to active compound and oil, contain a mixture of various surfactants, - among them also those which serve as penetration promoters-, and a hydrophobized alumo-layer silicate as a thickening agent. The stability of these preparations is good. It is disadvantageous, however, that a thickening agent is compulsorily present, because the preparation is more complicated on account of this. Moreover, the thickening agent in each case absorbs some of the amount of penetration promoter added, which is therefore not available for its real function.<br>
Furthermore, US-A 6 165 940 already discloses non-aqueous suspension concen¬trates in which, apart fi^om agrochemical active compound, penetration promoter and surfactant or surfactant mixture, an organic solvent is present, suitable solvents of this type also being paraffin oil or vegetable oil esters. The biological activity and the stability of the spray liquors which can be prepared from these formulations by diluting with water, however, is not always adequate.<br>
New oil-based suspension concentrates have now been found, which consist of<br>
at least one agrochemical active compound which is solid at room tem¬perature,<br>
at least one penetration promoter,<br>
at least one vegetable oil,<br><br>
at least one non-ionic surfactant or dispersing aid and/or at least one anionic surfactant or dispersing aid and<br>
optionally one or more additives from the group consisting of the emulsifying agents, the antifoam agents, the preservatives, the antioxidants, the colourants and/or the inert filling materials.<br>
It has furthermore been found that the oil-based suspension concentrates according to the invention can be prepared by mixing<br>
at least one agrochemical active compound which is solid at room tem¬perature,<br>
at least one penetration promoter,<br>
at least one vegetable oil,<br>
at least one non-ionic surfactant or dispersing aid and/or at least one anionic surfactant or dispersing aid and<br>
optionally one or more additives from the groups consisting of the emul¬sifying agents, the antifoam agents, the preservatives, the antioxidants, the colourants and/or the inert filling materials<br>
with one another and then optionally grinding the resulting suspension.<br>
Finally, it has been found that the oil-based suspension concentrates according to the invention are very highly suitable for the application of the agrochemical active compounds contained to plants and/or their habitat.<br><br>
It is to be indicated as extremely surprising that the oil-based suspension concentrates according to the invention have a very good stability, although they contain no thickening agent. It is also unexpected that they exhibit a markedly better biological activity than the previously known formulations having the most similar compo¬sition. Otherwise, the oil-based suspension concentrates according to the invention, with respect to their activity, surprisingly also excel analogous preparations which, in addition to the other components, contain either only penetration promoter or only vegetable oil. Such a synergistic effect could not be foreseen on the basis of the prior art described above.<br>
The oil-based suspension concentrates according to the invention are also distin¬guished by a number of advantages. Thus their preparation is less complicated than the preparation of corresponding formulations in which thickening agents are present. It is furthermore advantageous that on diluting the concentrates according to the invention with water neither a significant formation of cream nor a troublesome formation of flocks occurs, which is frequently the case with corresponding pre¬viously known preparations. Finally, the formulations according to the invention favour the biological activity of the active components contained, so that in comparison to conventional preparations either a higher activity is achieved or less active compound is necessary.<br>

The oil-based suspension concentrates according to the invention are prepared by mixing the components with one another in the ratios desired in each case. The sequence in which the constituents are blended with one another is arbitrary. Expediently, the solid components are employed in finely ground state. However, it is also possible firstly to subject the suspension resulting after the blending of the constituents to a coarse grinding and then to a fine grinding so that the average particle size is below 20 |um. Suspension concentrates are preferred in which the solid particles have an average particle size of between 1 and 10 \im.<br>
The temperatures can be varied within a certain range when carrying out the process according to the invention. The process is in general carried out at temperatures between 10°C and 60°C, preferably between 15°C and 40°C.<br>
For carrying out the process according to the invention, customary mixing and grinding equipment is suitable which is employed for the preparation of agrochemical formulations.<br>
The oil-based suspension concentrates according to the invention are formulations which remain stable even after relatively long storage at elevated temperatures or in the cold, since no crystal growth is observed. They can be converted into homo¬geneous spray liquids by dilution with water. These spray liquids are used according to customary methods, i.e., for example, by spraying, watering or injecting.<br>
The application rate of the oil-based suspension concentrates according to the invention can be varied within a relatively wide range. It depends on the particular agrochemical active compounds and on their content in the formulations.<br>
With the aid of the oil-based suspension concentrates according to the invention, agrochemical active compounds can be applied to plants and/or their habitat in a particularly advantageous manner. The agrochemical active compounds contained in<br><br>
this case display a better biological activity than on application in the form of the corresponding conventional formulations.<br>
The  subject  invention  relates  to  an  oil-based  suspension  concentrates, consisting of<br>
at least one agrochemical active compound which is solid at room temperature.<br>

Example II<br>
Penetration test<br>
In this test, the penetration of active compounds through enzymatically isolated cuticles of apple tree leaves was measured.<br>
Leaves were used which were cut off in the fully developed state of apple trees of the variety Golden Delicious. The cuticles were isolated by<br>
firstly filling, by means of vacuum infiltration with a pectinase solution (0.2 to 2% strength) buffered to a pH of between 3 and 4, leaf discs which had been marked on the bottom with dye and punched out,<br>
then adding sodium azide and<br>
allowing the leaf discs treated in this way to stand until the disintegration of the original leaf structure and the detachment of the non-cellular cuticles.<br>
After this, only the leaf cuticles of the tops of the leaves which were free from stomata and hairs were used further. They were washed a number of times alternately with water and a buffer solution of pH 7. The clean cuticles obtained were finally mounted on small Teflon plates and smoothed out and dried using a gentle jet of air.<br>
In the next step, the cuticle membranes thus obtained were placed into difftision cells (= transport chambers) of stainless steel for membrane transport investigations. For this, using tweezers the cuticles were placed centrally on the edges of the diffusion cells coated with silicone grease and sealed using a likewise greased ring. The arrangement had been chosen such that the morphological outer side of the cuticles was directed outwards, i.e. to the air, while the original inner side was facing the<br><br>
interior of the diffusion cell. The diffusion cells were filled with water or with a mixture of water and solvent.<br>
For determination of the penetration, 9 [i\ in each case of a spray liquor of the composition mentioned below was applied to the outer side of a cuticle.<br>
Spray liquor A<br>
0.2 g   of thiacloprid 0.4 g   of sunflower oil 0.4 g   of formulating aids in 1 litre of water.<br>
Spray liquor B<br>
0.2 g   of thiacloprid<br>
0.5 g   of 2-ethyl-hexyl alkoxylate of the formula (Ic-2) 0.3 g   of formulating aids in 1 Htre of water.<br>
Spray liquor C<br>
0.2 g   of thiacloprid 0.4 g   of sunflower oil<br>
0.2 g   of 2-ethyl-hexyl alkoxylate of the formula (Ic-2) 0.2 g   of formulating aids in 1 litre of water.<br><br>
spray liquor D<br>
0.2 g   of thiacloprid 0.3 g   of formulating aids in 1 litre of water, (prepared firom commercially available suspension concentrate by diluting with water).<br>
CIPAC water was in each case used in the spray liquors.<br>
After the application of the spray liquors, the water was allowed to evaporate in each case, then the chambers were in each case turned and placed in thermostatted baths, a saturated aqueous calcium nitrate 4-hydrate solution in each case being located under the outer side of the cuticles. The penetration commencing therefore took place at a relative humidity of 56% and a set temperature of 25°C. Samples were removed at regular intervals using a syringe and investigated by means of HPLC for the content of penetrated active compound.<br>
The experimental results can be seen from the following table. The numbers stated are average values of 8 measurements.<br>
