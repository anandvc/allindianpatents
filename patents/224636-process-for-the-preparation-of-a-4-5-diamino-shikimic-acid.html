The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 4,5-diamino shikimic acid derivatives, especially for the preparation of ethyl (3R, 4R, 5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-(l-ethylpropoxy)-l-cyclohexene-l-carboxylate and its pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts from 4-amino-5-azido shikimic acid derivatives, especially from ethyl (3R, 4R, 5S)-4-acetamido-5-azido-3-(l-ethylpropoxy)-l-cyclohexene-l-carboxylate.<br>
4,5-diamino shikimic acid derivatives, especially the ethyl (3R, 4R, 5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-(l-ethylpropoxy)-l-cyclohexene-l-carboxylate and its pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts are potent inhibitors of viral neuraminidase ( J.C.Rohloff et al., J.Org.Chem. 63,1998, 4545-4550; WO 98/07685).<br>
A reduction of ethyl (3R, 4R, 5S)-4-acetamido-5-azido-3-(l-ethylpropoxy)-l-cyclohexene-1-carboxylate to ethyl (3R, 4R, 5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-(l-ethylpropoxy)-l-cyclohexene-l-carboxylate by a hydrogenation in the presence of a Raney nickel catalyst is known in the art (J.C.Rohloff et al, loc.cit.).<br>
It was found that the "5-azido" starting compound from its prior synthesis always contains a small amount of the "2,5-diazido" compound formed by formal addition of hydrazoic acid to the double bond. In the course of the hydrogenation the azido group in 5-position is readily converted to the desired amino group, the transformation of the azido group in 2-position however is very slow. Accordingly a "2-azido-5-amino" intermediate is formed which was shown to be "Ames positive" and therefore suspicious of being mutagenic.<br><br>
This intermediate cannot be satisfactorily removed with the common purification techniques. Also, the problem cannot be overcome by prolonging the hydrogenation time for the "cyclohexene double bond" becomes hydrogenated, too.<br>
Object of the present invention therefore is to provide process which does not encompass this difficulties known in the art i.e. a process which allows easy access to the target product in an excellent quality.<br>
It was found that by reduction with a phosphine in the presence of a catalytic amount of an acid according to claim 1 this object could surprisingly be achieved.<br>
The present invention therefore relates to a process for the preparation of a 4,5-diamino shikimic acid derivative of formula<br><br>
and a pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt thereof<br>
wherein<br>
R1 is an optionally substituted alkyl group,<br>
R2	 is an alkyl group and<br>
R and R , independent of each other are H or an amino protecting group, with the<br>
proviso that not both R3 and R4 are H<br>
which is characterized by the reduction of a 4-amino-5-azido-shikimic acid derivative of formula<br><br><br>
	J<br>
wherein R1 , R2 , R3 and R4 have the meaning as outlined above with a phosphine in the presence of a catalytic amount of an acid and, if necessary, by further transformation into a pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt.<br>
The term alkyl in R1 has the meaning of a straight chained or branched alkyl group of 1 to 20 C-atoms, expediently of 1 to 12 C-atoms. Examples of such alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, tert. butyl, pentyl and its isomers, hexyl and its isomers, heptyl and its isomers, octyl and its isomers, nonyl and its isomers, decyl and its isomers, undecyl and its isomers and dodecyl and its isomers.<br>
This alkyl group can be substituted with one or more substituents as defined in e.g. WO 98/07685. Suitable substituents are C1-6-alkyl (as defined above), C1-6-alkenyl, C3-6-cycloalkyl, hydroxy, C1-6- alkoxy, C1-6-alkoxycarbonyl, F, CI, Br, and J. Preferred meaning for R1 is 1-ethylpropyl.<br>
R is a straight chained or branched alkyl group of 1 to 12 C-atoms, expediently of 1 to 6 C-atoms as exemplified above.<br>
Preferred meaning for R is ethyl.<br>
The term amino protecting group in R and R refers to any protecting group conventionally used and known in the art. They are described e.g. in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", Theodora W. Greene et al., John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., New York, 1991, p.315-385. Suitable amino protecting groups are also given in e.g. the WO 98/07685<br>
Preferred amino protecting groups are alkanoyl groups, more preferably lower C1-6-alkanoyl such as hexanoyl, pentanoyl, butanoyl (butyryl), propanoyl (propionyl), ethanoyl (acetyl) and methanoyl (formyl). Preferred alkanoyl group and therefore preferred meaning for R3 is acetyl and for R4 is H.<br>
The 4-amino-5-azido-shikimic acid derivative of formula (II) as starting compounds of the present process of the invention are accessible as described in J.C.Rohloff et al., loc. cit. and in WO 98/07685.<br>
Preferred 4-amino-5-azido-shikimic acid derivative of formula (II) is the ethyl (3R, 4R, 5S)-4-acetamido-5-azido-3-(l-ethylpropoxy)-l-cyclohexene-l-carboxylate. Accordingly preferred 4,5-diamino shikimic acid derivative of formula (I) is the ethyl (3R, 4R, 5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-(l-ethylpropoxy)-l-cyclohexene-l-carboxylate and the ethyl (3R, 4R, 5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-(l-ethylpropoxy)-l-cyclohexene-l-carboxylate<br><br>
Phosphate (1:1) .<br>
The phosphine used can be defined by the general formula<br>
P (R5)3        III<br>
wherein R5 is alkyl.<br>
R5 expediently is a straight chained or branched C1-8 alkyl group as defined above.<br>
Phosphines which can suitably be used are trioctyl phosphine, triisobutyl phosphine, tri-n-butyl phosphine, and triethyl phosphine. Most preferred phosphine is the tri-n-butyl phosphine.<br>
The phosphine is as rule added in stoichiometric amounts or in a slight slight excess of up to 1.05 equivalents relating to the 4-amino-5-azido-shikimic acid derivative of formula<br>
(II).<br>
Typically the reduction is performed in a polar protic solvent such as alcohols, preferably in aqueous ethanol or aqueous tetrahydrofuran , most preferably in aqueous ethanol.<br>
The reaction temperature mainly depends on the phosphine used but as a rule lies in the range of-20°C to 30°C, preferably between 0 and 25°C.<br>
It can be favorable to perform the reaction at two temperature levels, thereby having the lower temperature range given above for the addition of the phosphine and thereafter having a slightly higher temperature of up to room temperature to bring the reaction to completion.<br>
As a specific embodiment of the present invention it was found that catalytic amounts of an acid present during the conversion suppresses the ester hydrolysis which otherwise takes place to a small extent of some percent and thereby leads to an undesirable impurity.<br>
Suitable acid is a carboxylic acid, expediently acetic acid. The acetic acid is usually added in the form of glacial acetic acid in catalytic quantities of 0.5 mol % to 3.0 mol % relating to the 4-amino-5-azido-shikimic acid derivative of formula (II).<br><br>
The process is as a rule finished after 3 h to 6 h .<br>
Thereafter work up of the reaction mixture can happen by applying methods known to the skilled in the art. Expediently the reaction mixture is, preferably after stabilization with 
Though the 4,5-diamino shikimic acid derivative can be isolated e.g. by evaporation and crystallization, it is preferably kept in e.g. an ethanolic solution and then further transformed into the pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt following the methods described in J.C.Rohloff et al, J.Org.Chem. 63, 1998,4545-4550; WO 98/07685).<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts" embraces salts with inorganic and organic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid and the like.<br>
The salt formation is effected with methods which are known per se and which are familiar to any person skilled in the art. Not only salts with inorganic acids, but also salts with organic acids come into consideration. Hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, sulphates, nitrates, citrates, acetates, maleates, succinates, methan-sulphonates, p-toluenesulphonates and the like are examples of such salts.<br>
Preferred pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt is the 1:1 salt with phosphoric acid which can be formed preferably in ethanolic solution at a temperature of-20°C to 60°C .<br>
The following examples shall illustrate the invention in more detail without limiting it.<br>
1.   Preparation of ethyl (3R, 4R, 5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-(l-ethylpropoxy)-l-cyclohexene- 1-carboxylate<br>
50.0 g (0.147 mol) ethyl (3R, 4R, 5S)-4-acetamido-5-azido-3-(l-ethylpropoxy)-l-cyclohexene-1-carboxylate were placed in a nitrogen purged 1000 ml glass reactor fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a condenser, and a 250 ml dropping funnel. 300 ml ethanol, 50 ml water and 0.09 g acetic acid were added. To the resulting clear solution 31.4 g (0.155 mol) tributylphosphine dissolved in 150 ml ethanol were continuously added at a<br><br>
temperature of 5 °C (+/- 5°C) over a period of 30 - 90 min. Under slight cooling of the jacket (~-3°C) the reaction temperature was kept at this temperature. The feeder was rinsed with 20 ml ethanol. The clear reaction mixture was stirred for additional 90 min at 5 °C (+/-5°C) under slight jacket cooling. Subsequently the temperature was raised within 30 - 60 min to 20 - 25 °C and the solution was stirred for another 3h (nitrogen evolving).<br>
After the reaction was finished (HPLC control) 0.18 g acetic acid were added to the clear solution. Then the mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure (300 to 50 mbar) at a maximum temperature of 60 °C and a maximum jacket temperature of 75 °C near to dryness. The oily residue (80 - 100 ml) was diluted with 160 ml ethanol, the resulting solution was then again concentrated following the method as mentioned above. The oily residue was dissolved in ethanol up to a volume of 250 ml. The water content of this solution was determined by KF(Karl Fischer) titration of being less than 1.0 % wt. %. Yield: 44.4 g (97 % area by HPLC) of the title product in ethanolic solution.<br>
2.      Preparation of ethyl (3R, 4R, 5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-(l-ethylpropoxy)-l-cyclohexene-1-carboxylate Phosphate (1:1)<br>
In a dry and nitrogen purged 1000 ml glass reactor fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a condenser, and a 500 ml dropping funnel 17.0 g ortho phosphoric acid (85 % in water) were dissolved in 400 ml ethanol and the resulting clear solution was warmed to 50 - 55 °C. Subsequently the 250 ml ethanolic solution obtained from example 1 and containing 0.147 mol of ethyl (3R, 4R, 5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-(l-ethylpropoxy)-l-cyclohexene-l-carboxylate were added under stirring. After fast addition (10-15 min) of two thirds (ca.l60 ml) of the total volume of this solution the addition was stopped and the supersaturated clear solution was seeded with 0.2 g of previously obtained ethyl (3R, 4R, 5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-(l-ethylpropoxy)-l-cyclohexene-l-carboxylate Phosphate (1:1). Immediately afterwards crystallization commenced. The resulting thick suspension was stirred for 45 - 60 min at 50 - 55°C . Then the remaining amine solution was slowly added (45 - 60 min) to the suspension at 50 - 55 °C.   The feeder was rinsed with 20 ml ethanol. Subsequently the thick suspension was continuously cooled to 12 - 20°C in about 4 h (cooling speed = 10 °C/h). To complete the crystallization stirring was continued at 12 - 20 °C for additional 2 ± 1 h. Ethyl (3R, 4R, 5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-(l-ethylpropoxy)-l-cyclohexene-l-carboxylate Phosphate (1:1) was isolated by pressure<br>
filtration (0.3 bar nitrogen overpressure, Dacron filter cloth). The crystalline product was<br><br>
washed twice with 240 ml acetone and twice with 300 ml n-heptane at room temperature. Ethyl (3R, 4R, 5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-(l-ethylpropoxy)-l-cyclohexene-l-carboxylate<br>
