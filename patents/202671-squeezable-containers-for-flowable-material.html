The nanocomposite is advantageously prepared by first swelling an untreated clay in water, then removing the water to form an organophilic clay that is dispersible in non-polar organic solvents. The organophilic clay can then be treated with an alkyl aluminoxane and subsequently a catalyst to form a complex that promotes olefin or styrenic polymerization and platelet dispersion.

Frisk, et. al., WO 98/01346 disclose a container which is composed of a polymer material integrated with a plurality of nanosize particles of a clay mineral which act to enhance the barrier properties of the container. The polymer material may be PET, COPET or any mixture thereof. The nanocomposite polymer container decreases the permeability of various gases without substantially altering the fabrication method for producing containers composed of PET or COPET material, and without altering the containers themselves. The nanocomposite polymer containers of the disclosure are able to accomplish this due to the minimal amount of clay integrated with the polymer material, i.e., between 0.1 % and 10 % weight of the container. The small amount of clay provides a substantial barrier due to the high aspect ratios of the clay particles which will vary between 100 and 2000. The nanocomposite polymer container may be produced using in situ polymerization, solution intercalation, or melt exfoliation to integrate the clay mineral with the polymer material matrix. The clay mineral may be smectite, vermiculite, halloysite or any synthetic analog thereof, with a preference for the montmorillonite species of smectite clays. Summary of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to squeezable containers for flowable products having improved barrier and/or mechanical properties, wherein the squeezable containers comprise a polymeric nanocomposite comprising a polymer and nanosize particles of a modified clay, and methods of making the squeezable containers. The invention further relates to squeezable containers for a flowable product comprising a head and<br><br>
a sleeve, at least one layer of said head or said sleeve comprising a polymeric nanocomposite, wherein said nanocomposite comprises a polymer and nanosize particles of a modified clay. Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Layered clay minerals such as smectite clays which are further exemplified by montmonllonite, nontronite, beidellite, volkonskoite, hectorite, saponite, sauconite, magadite, kenyaite and vermiculite are composed of packets of face to face stacking of individual silicate layers or sheets. In nature, the metal ions are substituted for ions such as Mg, Fe, Mn and Li. Because of this substitution, the sheets have a negative charge imbalance that is neutralized by hydratable cations such as sodium and calcium. The thickness of the sheets is about 1 nm and the diameter of the sheets is typically from 50 to 1000 nm resulting in aspect ratios of 50 to 1000. These layered clay minerals are also known as phyllosilicates.<br>
It is known that these layered clay minerals can be treated with organic molecules such as, e.g., organic ammonium ions to insert the organic molecules between adjacent planar silicate layers thereby increasing the interlayer spacing between the adjacent silicate layers. This process is known as intercalation and the resulting treated clay mineral is termed "modified clay." The thus-treated intercalated phyllosilicates have interlayer spacing of at least 10-20 A and up to about 100 A. The modified clay may then be used in at least two distinct methods for preparing nanocomposites, i.e., melt compounding and in situ polymerization. Both methods are known to those skilled in the art. The preferred method of melt compounding of nanocomposites is with a twin-screw extruder or similar blending apparatus. In order to achieve good intercalation, exfoliation and dispersion of the clay minerals,<br><br>
processing conditions should be such that both shear rate and residence time are optimized.<br>
In addition to these methods, the modified clay can also be incorporated into liquid coatings or adhesives  As with melt compounding, processing conditions should be such that both shear rate and residence time are optimized. The adhesive or coating may consist of monomer, oligomer, polymer or mixtures thereof and may undergo polymerization after it has been applied to a substrate.<br>
The amount of modified clay combined with the polymer should be in an amount that is sufficient to provide the desired barrier and/or mechanical properties. The amount of modified clay in the nanocomposites of the invention comprises about 0.1% to about 25% by weight of the composition. A preferred range of modified clay material comprises about 0.5% to about 10% of the composition.<br>
Polymers suitable for use in the nanocomposites of the present invention are exemplified, but not limited to, polyolefins such as low density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), medium density polyethylene (MDPE), high density polyethylene (HDPE), and polypropylene (PP), polyamides such as poly(m-xyleneadipamide) (MXD6), poly(hexamethylenesebacamide), poly(hexamethyleneadipamide) and poly(e-caprolactam), polyesters such as poly(ethylene terephthalate), and polyacrylonitriles. Other polymers suitable for use in the nanocomposites of the invention include ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymers, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers, polyesters grafted with maleic anhydride, PVdC, aliphatic polyketone, and LCP (liquid crystalline polymers). A polyketone is exemplified by Carillon® which is produced by Shell. A liquid crystalline polymer is<br><br><br>
exemplified by Vectra® which is produced by Ticona. Further polymers that may be used include epoxy and polyurethane adhesives.<br>
While certain clay minerals have been exemplified above it is understood that any clay mineral (both natural and synthesized) having a cation-exchange capacity of 50 to 200 milliequivalent/100g and a large contact area with the polymer to be used in said nanocomposite are useful in the present invention.

The mechanical properties of materials for plastic packaging are physical properties that relate to the response (deformation) of the material under an applied stress. Some important mechanical properties are tensile strength, stiffness (flexural modulus), compressive strength, and impact resistance (toughness). Concerning a squeezable container, mechanical properties relate to the deformation of the squeezable container under an applied stress or load. Such properties include top load, wall stiffness (resistance to buckling), and impact breakage resistance. Several standard ASTM tests for measuring mechanical properties of a material are listed below.<br>
The term "thermal stability" relates to the changes in mechanical properties and dimensions of a squeezable container, with changes in temperature, especially at extremes of temperature. Some important measures of the thermal stability of a<br>
-15-<br><br>
squeezable container are: shrinkage or relaxation at elevated temperatures; creep (gradual dimensional change) under load, especially at elevated temperatures; brittleness at cold temperatures; and loss of strength and stiffness at elevated temperatures. One standard method of gauging the degree of softening of a material at elevated temperatures is the heat deflection temperature (HDT), as defined in ASTM-648 below.<br>
The squeezable containers of the present invention have improved barrier and/or mechanical properties and comprise at least one layer comprising a polymer material integrated with a modified clay wherein the modified clay is between about 0.5% to about 10% by weight of the nanocomposite layer.<br>
The clay minerals may be selected from the group consisting of smectite, vermiculite and halloysite. A preferred group is smectite clay wherein smectite may be selected from montmorillonile, saponite, beidellite, nontronite, hectorite and mixtures thereof. Particularly preferred smectite clay for use in squeezable containers is montmorillonite. The clay is usually present in a sodium ion exchange form. The clay may also be treated with an intercalant which assists in the integration of the modified clay with the polymer material. Procedures for intercalating the clay minerals and forming the nanocomposites have been described earlier.<br>
One source for the clay is Southern Clay Products, Inc., of Gonzales, Texas which markets the clay under the product name "Cloisite" which are particular formulations of the clay and other minor components. Another source for the clay is Nanocor, Inc. of Carmel, Indiana, which markets the clay under the product name "Nanomer". However, those skilled in the art will recognize that many sources of the<br><br><br>
clay are available and those sources may have their own particular formulations which are not outside the scope of the present invention.<br>
Polymers suitable for use in the nanocomposites of the present invention are exemplified, but not limited to, polyolefins such as low density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), medium density polyethylene (MDPE), high density polyethylene (HDPE), and polypropylene (PP), polyamides such as poly(m-xyleneadipamide) (MXD6), poly(hexamethylenesebacamide), poly(hexamethyleneadipamide) and poly( -caprolactam), polyesters such as poly(ethylene terephthalate), and polyacrylonitriles. Other polymers suitable for use in the nanocomposites of the invention include ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymers, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers, polyesters grafted with maleic anhydride, PVdC, aliphatic polyketone, and LCP (liquid crystalline polymers). A polyketone is exemplified by Carillon® which is produced by Shell. A liquid crystalline polymer is exemplified by Vectra® which is produced by Ticona. Further polymers that may be used include epoxy and polyurethane adhesives.<br>
While certain clays have been exemplified above it is understood that any clay (both natural and synthesized) having a cation-exchange capacity of 50 to 200 milliequivalent/100g and a large contact area with the polymer to be used in said nanocomposite are useful in the present invention.<br>
The squeezable containers of the invention have improved barrier and/or mechanical properties and comprise at least one layer of a polymer which has been integrated with nanosize particles of a modified clay. In another embodiment of the invention, the squeezable containers comprise a head and a sleeve, at least one of said<br>
(7<br><br>
head or said sleeve comprising a polymeric nanocomposite, wherein said nanocomposite comprises a polymer and nanosize particles of a modified clay.<br>
In the squeezable container industry, there is a need to improve the barrier and mechanical properties of the squeezable containers. It has been known to blend inorganic filler materials with a polymer material in squeezable containers in order to achieve these improved properties. However this approach has not addressed the need completely as the inorganic filler may embrittle the structure and/or detract from its optical properties. It has now been found that the incorporation of nanocomposites into one or more of the polymeric layers of said squeezable containers can improve the barrier and/or mechanical properties without sacrificing and many times improving the mechanical and optical properties the other properties and polymeric nature of the material.<br>
The squeezable containers of the present invention have improved barrier and/or mechanical properties and comprise at least one layer comprising polymer material integrated with a modified clay wherein the modified clay is between about 0.5% to about 10% weight of the nanocomposite layer.<br>
The squeezable containers of the present invention include but are not limited to laminated squeezable containers and plastic squeezable containers and may consist of one or more polymeric layers wherein one or more of these layers may comprise a polymeric material integrated with a nanosize particle of a modified clay between about 0.5% to about 10% weight of the nanocomposite layer. The nanosize particles of the modified clay have a thickness of between about 3 A and about 50 A, and an aspect ratio of between about 50 and about 1000.<br><br><br>
Laminated squeezable containers or tubes are tubes which are produced from flat, rollstock, which is formed into tubes. Plastic squeezable containers or tubes are tubes which are produced by annular extrusion. The polymer is extruded into a cylindrical configuration and cut to form a sleeve for the tube. The head of the plastic tube is produced by injection or compression molding.<br>
As mentioned above, the tubes of the present invention can be divided into at least two groups - laminated tubes and plastic tubes. Plastic tubes can be further divided into monolayer plastic tubes and coextruded plastic tubes. Both laminated tubes and plastic tubes consist of two parts - the sleeve and the head. Additionally, both the laminated tubes and the: plastic tubes can have a coating applied to the outside of the entire tube.<br>
The nanocomposites can be present in one or more layers which comprise the sleeve and/or head sections of both laminated tubes and plastic tubes. Additionally, the nanocomposite can also comprise the coating which can be applied as an overwrap to both plastic tubes and laminated tubes.<br>
The tubes of the present invention have many applications in the packaging industry. These applications can be exemplified but not limited to laminated tubes for toothpaste, industrial caulks and pharmaceutical creams and ointments and plastic tubes for lotions and creams.<br>
In order to evaluate the barrier properties of the containers of the present invention the following tests can be employed.<br>
ASTM F1249 is a test for determining the rate of water vapor transmission through flexible barrier materials. The water vapor transmission rate is defined as the<br><br><br>
time rate of water vapor flow normal to the surfaces, under steady-state conditions, per unit area.<br>
ASTM D3985 is a test method which covers a procedure for determination of the steady-state rate of transmission of oxygen gas through plastic films. The oxygen transmission rate is defined as the quantity of oxygen gas passing through a unit area of the parallel surfaces of a plastic film per unit time under the conditions of the D3985 test method.<br>
ASTM D638 is a test method which covers the determination of the tensile properties of unreinforced and reinforced plastics in the form of dumb-bell shaped test specimens when tested under defined conditions of pretreatment, temperature, humidity, and testing machine speed. In general, this test measures the uniaxial strain (elongation) of the sample as a function of applied stress.<br>
ASTM D790 is a test method which covers the determination of the flexural properties of unreinforced and reinforced plastics, from samples generally in the form of rectangular bars molded directly or cut from sheet or plate stock. In general, this test measures the stiffness, or the resistance of a material to bending.<br>
ASTM D648 is a test method which covers the determination of the temperature at which an arbitrary deformation occurs when specimens are subjected to a particular set of testing conditions. This test provides a measure of the temperature stability of a material, i.e., the temperature below which the material does not readily deform under a standard load condition.<br>
