A series of tubes was prepared in which the same quantity of sterile nutritive medium is distributed. Increasing quantities of the product to be studied are distributed in each tube, then each tube is seeded with a bacterial strain.  After incubation for 24 hours in an oven at 37°C, the growth inhibition is evaluated by transillumination which allows the minimum inhibitory concentrations (M.I.C.) to be determined expressed in micrograms/cm3. In vitro activity CM1 in µg/ml On the following strains:<br>
