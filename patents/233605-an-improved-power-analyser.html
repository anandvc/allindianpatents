				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an improved power analyser for monitoring and analysis of different electrical parameters like voltage, current, frequency, harmonics, and transients which determine the quality of power in ac as well as dc electrical instruments or electronic circuits.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
The monitoring and analysis of different electrical parameters is important to ensure the smooth functioning of different electrical/electronic instruments and protect them from intermittent power disturbances like sudden spikes, under and over voltages, frequency deviations and harmonic distortions. Sometimes these deviations may ultimately result in failure of the various equipments.<br>
Traditional systems for monitoring power require installation of individual measuring devices to monitor specific electrical parameters like current, voltage or wattage. These devices could be analog or digital and these comprise of discrete current and voltage transducers.<br>
However, these devices are not considered very efficient as the monitoring as well as analysis of various electrical parameters can not be done at a high speed with these devices. Further, separate measuring devices for each electrical parameters add to the overall maintenance cost of the system. These traditional systems for monitoring power are no longer in much use.<br>
The improved type of power analysing systems presently available consist of dedicated hardware with embedded processors. Such type of systems calculate various electrical parameters such as rms &amp; peak values of current &amp; voltage, frequency, power, voltage sags &amp; swells and frequency deviations with the help of embedded processors. These power analysers utilise sampling technique to analyse the input electrical parameters to calculate and display voltage transients, voltage sags, frequency deviations and harmonic distortion analysis in real time mode. The accuracy at which the different parameters can be calculated depends upon the sampling rate at<br>
which the analog waveforms of the input signals are digitized. However, a limit is imposed upon the sampling rate because of the requirement of computing time needed by the embedded processor to calculate the various electrical parameters required to be displayed.<br>
However, such type of power analysers, presently available, suffer from many disadvantages.<br>
One major disadvantage of the presently available power analysers is that such systems utilise dedicated embedded processors with fixed performance parameters and thus lacking versatility in terms of upgradation of processor performance.<br>
Another disadvantage of the known power analysers with dedicated embedded processor is that the speed of the analysis of the different electrical parameters is limited by the attributes of embedded processor which can not be changed.<br>
Yet another disadvantage of the known power analysers is that the embedded processor of such systems can not be adopted to multifunctional role such as CRO or a normal PC.<br>
Still further disadvantage of the known power analysers is that such analysers employ lower sampling rate to sample the input signals thus limiting the accuracy of measurement of different power parameters.<br>
Yet another disadvantage of the known power analysers is that these analysers can not monitor the transients and interruptions of very short duration because of lower sampling rates employed.<br>
Still further disadvantage of known power analysers is that these analysers employ LED or LCD display device having lower resolutions.<br>
Yet another disadvantage of the known power analysers is that these analysers suffer from limited memory of the embedded processors and thus putting a limitation on the amount of data which can be stored and analysed. The memory capacity available in the known power analysers is of the order of 2MB only.<br>
Still further disadvantage of the known power analysers is that simultaneous display of both current and voltage in real time is not possible in such systems.<br>
Yet another drawback of these power analysers known in the art is that the number of input channels available for analysis of input signals is limited to a maximum value of 6 only.<br>
Still further disadvantage of the known power analysers is that recording and playback of voltage _and current waveforms is not possible in these power analysers.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO THE DRAWING<br>
Additional advantages and features of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description of the preferred embodiment which has been described and illustrated with the help of following drawing wherein<br>
Fig (1)    describes the block diagram of the power analyser.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1 the present power analyser comprises of voltage transducer (1), current transducer (2), data acquisition card (3) and host computer (4). The probes of the voltage transducer (1) and current transducer (2) are connected to the power line (5,6). There are total 16 such voltage and current transducers with clamps which can be utilised to monitor plurality of input signals simultaneously. The voltage transducer (1) steps down the input voltage to a value in a range from -10 to +10 volt which can be processed by the data acquisition card (3). Similarly current transducer (2) converts the input current signal to equivalent voltage within a range from -10 to + 10 volt which is within acceptable range of data acquisition card. Data acquisition card acts as an interface between input signals and host computer having 16 input channels corresponding to 16 voltage and current transducers. In the data acquisition card, these input signals coming from the 16 input channels are synchronised and selected in a predetermined manner by the multiplexer (7). The signal coming from the multiplexer (7) is amplified by instrument amplifier (8) having a fixed value of magnification and further amplified by the gain amplifier (9) having<br>
selectable amplifications of 1, 10, 100 and 1000. This amplified signal is sampled at higher frequency by sample and hold circuit (10) in a predetermined manner. The sampling frequency in decided by the Nyquist criteria. According to this criteria the sampling frequency should be greater or equal to the twice the value of signal frequency. The output of the sample and hold circuit (10) is converted to digital form by 12 bit A/D converter (11). The digitised data is processed by the main processing unit (12) of the host computer (4). Main processing unit (12) of the host computer synchronises the input digitised data from the data acquisition card (3) to high resolution monitor (14). Disk storage (13) of the host computer (4) can be utilised to store the output digitised data from the data acquisition card for further processing, analysing and displaying on the high resolution monitor (14).<br>
The custom built program written in C language resident in the host personal computer acts as a user interface allowing user to specify various operating modes, sampling parameters, threshold limits, storage options and to perform a variety of tasks such as logging of text data, limit checking, graphics display, playing back current and voltage waveform, computing harmonic distortion up to 9th harmonic etc.<br>
The system can operate in six different modes which can be selected depending upon the specific requirements. These operating modes along with their specific functions have been described briefly in the following.<br>
1.	CONTINUOUS MONITORING MODE<br>
This mode displays and records rms and peak values of voltage, current, and frequency with time stamp in text mode and sounds buzzer in case of power supply failure.<br>
2.	REAL TIME WAVEFORM DISPLAY MODE<br>
This mode displays and records the voltage and current waveforms with site location, time stamp, frequency, rms value, peak value and crest factor.<br>
3.	OUT OF LIMIT CHECKING MODE<br>
This mode records the voltage and current disturbances with time of occurrence, magnitude and duration in milliseconds and sounds an alarm whenever the rms values exceed beyond the predefined limits set by the user.<br>
4.	HARMONIC ANALYSIS MODE<br>
This mode computes and records Total Harmonic Distortion for voltage based on 2048 point FFT up to 9th harmonic in real time with time stamp.<br>
5.	IMPULSE MONITORING MODE<br>
This mode monitors for any transient in voltage waveform for a duration more than 50 micro seconds<br>
6.	GRAPHICS PLAYBACK MODE<br>
This mode plays back and prints the voltage and current waveforms, transients and spectral content recorded in the other modes.<br>
The embodiment of the invention which has been set forth above was for the purpose of illustration and it is not intended to limit the scope of invention.
