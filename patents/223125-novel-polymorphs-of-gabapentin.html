Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a novel crystalline Gabapentin Form-IV, process for its preparation and its use in the preparation of Gabapentin Form-II.<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
Gabapentin (i.e. 1-aminomethyl-l-cyclohexaneacetic acid), of the formula<br><br>
is the active principle mainly used for the treatment of convulsive type cerebral disorders, such as epilepsy, hypokinesia including fainting and other brain trauma and in general, it is deemed to produce an improvement in the cerebral functions. Commercially available Gabapentin is crystalline and exhibits various polymorphic forms such as monohydrate, Form-II and Form-Ill characterized by their typical IR and X-ray diffraction patterns.<br>
Several processes for the preparation of Gabapentin are reported in literature.<br>
US Patent No. 4,024,175 and US Patent No. 4,087,544 disclose preparations starting from cyclohexane"l,l-diacetic acid. They also discloses an acid salt Gabapentin hydrochloride hydrate in a stiochiometric ratio of 4:4:1 and a sodium salt of Gabapentin hydrate in stiochiometric ratio of 2:1.<br>
US Patent No 4,894,476 and US Patent No. 4,960,931 disclose methods for the conversion of hydrochloride salt into crystalline monohydrate by eluting the aqueous<br><br>
solution through a basic ion-exchange resin, producing a slurry from the elute, adding an alcohol to the slurry and isolating the final product by centrifuging followed by drying.<br>
U.S.Patent Application No. 2003/ 0009055, US Patent No. 6,528,682, US Patent No.6, 054,482, PCT Publication WO 02 34,709, EP 1,174,418, and US Patent no. 5,091,567, describe processes that yield Gabapentin via the conversion the hydrochloride by neutralization using ion-exchanger, followed by distillation of eluted aqueous solution and crystallization. The PCT Publication WO 02 44123 discloses a process for the preparation of Gabapentin by dissolving Gabapentin hydrochloride in a solvent followed by addition of an amine, which allows the removal of insoluble amine hydrochloride salt leaving Gabapentin in solution, which is isolated, by concentration and crystallization.<br>
Industrial implementation of such processes is difficult as large volumes of ion-exchange columns and distillation of water under vacuum at low temperature is involved. Other processes disclosed in US Patents 5,132,451; 5,095,148; 5,091,567; 5,068,413 involve hydrogenation of the nitrile intermediate to yield the free amino acid.<br>
PCT Publication WO 98 28,255 discloses a novel polymorph Form-Ill, its preparation from Gabapentin hydrochloride and a process for the conversion of Form-Ill to Gabapentin Form-II. The process involves dissolution of Gabapentin hydrochloride salt in an organic solvent, removal of inorganics by Alteration, distillation of solvent under vacuum at temperature below 35oC, addition of a second solvent, neutralization with a base at 20'oC - 25oC, followed by isolation of the Form-Ill. The Form-Ill is slurried in methanol for an extended period of about 14 hrs at 25 oC or recrystallized from methanol to yield Gabapentin Form-II.<br>
Our CO pending Indian Patent Application No 327/MAS/2003 discloses a process for conversion of Gabapentin hydrochloride into Gabapentin Form-II directly without the formation of Form-Ill. Another co pending Indian Patent Application No 330/MAS/2003 discloses the process for the formation of novel Gabapentin hemisulfate hemihydrate salt and its conversion to Gabapentin Form-II directly.<br><br>
The method of conversion of hydrochloride salt to Form-II via Form-Ill disclosed in PCT Publication WO 98 28,255 involves elaborate process steps use of diverse solvents in a multi-step sequence, making the process industrially unacceptable.<br>
There is a long felt need in the pharmaceutical industry to develop technically and commercially attractive processes for the preparation of Gabapentin Form-II.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a new techno-economically economically viable process for the preparation of Gabapentin Form-II.<br>
Another object of the invention is to explore other forms of Gabapentin, their characteristic features and process for their inter-form transformations.<br>
During the present investigations, it has surprisingly been found that a novel crystalline form now designated as Form-IV is formed when neutralization of Gabapentin acid salts is done appropriately with base(s) in the temperature range of about 20oC to about 75oC in different solvent,. Further it is found that is possible to convert Form-IV directly to Form-II.<br>
Thus in accordance of this invention, 1,1-Cyclohexane diacetic acid monoamide is reacted with alkali hypo halite followed by acidification with acids in presence of an organic solvent to extract the liberated acid salts into the solvent. An ante solvent is added to crystallize the Gabapentin acid salts. The separated salts is then suspending in organic solvent(s) and neutralized with base(s) in a specified temperature range, cooled to ambient temperature, followed by separation of Gabapentin form-IV for further conversion to Gabapentin form-II by slurring in ethanol at specified temperature.<br>
The process scheme is represented below.<br><br><br>

Detailed description of the Invention:<br>
The process of this invention comprising the steps of:<br>
-	Reaction of 1,1-cyclohexane diacetic acid mono amide with alkali hypo halite<br>
solution, acidification with acid(s) in presence of solvent(s)<br>
-	Extraction of the formed Gabapentin acid salt(s) into organic layer<br>
-	Separation of the organic layer, drying over dehydrating agents<br>
-	Addition of ante solvent(s), followed by optional cooling to precipitate the<br>
Gabapentin acid salt(s) and its isolation<br>
-	Dissolution of Gabapentin acid salts in short chain alcohol<br>
-	pH adjustment of the solution with base(s) in a specified temperature range<br>
-	Cooling the reaction mass to precipitate Gabapentin form-IV Separation of the formed Gabapentin form-IV<br><br>
-	Conversion of the form-IV into form-II by slurring in ethanol in a specified temperature range<br>
-	Separation of Gabapentin form-II followed by drying<br>
The isolated Gabapentin acid salts are characterized by chemical analysis to be Gabapentin hydrochloride hydrate in stiochiometric the ratio of 4:4:1 and Gabapentin sulphate hydrate in the stiochiometric ratio of 2:1:1 depending on the acid used.<br>
The novel Gabapentin Form IV characterized by XRD and IR as a new form not reported so far.<br>
The 1,1-cyclohexane diacetic acid mono amide used as starting material is prepared as per the literature (U.S.Patent No. 4,024,175).<br>
For the reaction of 1,1-cyclohexane diacetic acid mono amide with alkali hypo halite, the preferred alkali hypo halite is sodium hypochlorite solution. The reaction is carried out in a temperature range of about -10oCto about 5oC, the preferred range being about -5oC to about 5oC. Acidification of the reaction mass to a pH of about 2 and preferably below 2 in the range of about 1.0 to about 1.5 is carried out with acid preferably with hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid in presence of an organic solvent in a temperature range of about 15oC to about 25 oC. The preferred solvent is n-butanol.<br>
The reaction mass was allowed to settle and the organic layer is separated. The aqueous layer is extracted few times with the solvent. The combined extract is dried over dehydrating agents selected from materials such as anhydrous sodium sulphate, magnesium sulphate, etc.<br>
The dried organic layer is treated with ante solvent, optionally cooled to precipitate the acid salt(s). The ante solvent is selected from hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, alkyl ketones, alkyl ethers, the preferred solvent being hexane, toluene, acetone, di isopropyl ether or their mixtures.<br><br>
The precipitated salt(s) is separated by conventional methods such as filtration, centrifugation and dried to constant weight.<br>
The Gabapentin salt(s) is dissolved in short chain alcohol, preferred alcohol being ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol at about 200C to about 25 oC, stirred for about for sometime to get a clear solution. The temperature of the solution is raised above 60oC preferably between about 60oC to about 65 oC, and pH is adjusted a base the preferred ones being diethyl amine and di isopropyl ethyl amine. Gradual cooling to about 10oC to 25 oC, preferably between 20oC  25oC, results in the precipitation of Gabapentin form-IV which is separated by conventional means, washed with the solvent and dried in the preferred temperature range of about 45oC - 50oC.<br>
The Gabapentin form-IV is converted into form-II by suspending in ethanol, raising the temperature to about 60oC- 65oC, maintaining the temperature for sometime followed by gradual cooling with stirring for about 1-2 hrs at temperature 20oC - 25oC. Gabapentin form-II formed as the final product is separated, and dried to obtain the material of pharmaceutically acceptable quality.<br>
