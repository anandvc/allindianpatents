				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an inventory control  device. By way of example, and<br>
without intending to imply any limitation to the scope of the application, such a device may be placed in the home of a user for storage of products and adapted to transmit a signal to a destination location upon removal of the product so as to provide a data of the consumption of said product. Such a device may also be used in a store for stacking a plurality of a product and providing a signal to a destination location to provide a data of the sale and replenishment requirements.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Bar codes are known in the art, which are printed on the packaging or a label affixed to the product.   The bar codes are scanned by a sales person using a scanner to provide a signal relating to the price of the product the scanned data being fed to a computerized calculating machine. Though bar codes presently employed essentially provide a signal relating to the price of the product, in certain instances it could additionally or alternatively provide a signal relating to a numerical value of<br>
the consumption of the product. However, a disadvantage of the bar code system is that it can be used only in instances where the bar code can be conveniently printed  on the package or label. However, there are numerous instances wherein a label cannot be affixed to the product. Still further, the additional step of printing the bar code is required. Yet another disadvantage is that a scanner is required to scan the bar code. Still further, such a bar code system can advantageously be employed only with respect to products sold from stores.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a novel construction of an inventory control management device.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose an inventory management device having<br>
a transmitting location and a receiving location so as to provide a data on the consumption of a product at the transmitting location.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose an inventory management device which is simple, efficient and independent of mode of communication, namely it can end signals from homes which do not have a computer.<br>
DE8CRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided an inventory device comprising:<br>
Â£) a storage chamber (SC1) having atleast one sensor (S1/ S2), located at a first location for providing signals of the consumption of the product within said storage chamber (SC1);<br>
 a receiver system (RC) for receiving the signals from said storage chamber (SC1); and said receiver system (RC) adapted to be in communication with a distal location for providing data of the consumption of the product.<br>
The device of the present invention may be used in a home and provides a signal to a distal location, which could be a store, to provide a data on the consumption of a product by the consumer having such a device installed in his home. If reference is made to such an application, then the device may comprise a storage chamber provided in a first location, which is a home of a consumer. The storage chamber has one or<br>
more sensors at the inlet end to sense the number of products, such as soap, being introduced into the storage chamber, and which signal is either stored in memory at a receiver station and transmitted from the receiver to a distal. The distal location could be a store or vendor of the product. The storage chamber has one or more sensors at the outlet end to sense a removal or consumption, of the product from the storage chamber, and which provides a signal to a memory at the receiver station. Thus, the<br>
consumption data is provided to the distal end through the receiver station and the store <br>
keeper or   vendor can replenish the   product.    The device of the present   invention<br>
provides, firstly, the consumption data to the vendor or store keeper at the distal location and, secondly, a data to allow a replenishment of the product.<br>
Several distinct advantages ensue from the device of the present invention. One such advantage is that it is no longer for a consumer to effect a purchase from a store.<br>
Instead, the device provides the replenished and  data to the store keeper, and who can then replenish  the product.<br>
Reference is made hereinabove only to one of the applications of the device of the present invention. Such a device may alternatively be employed   in a store to provide an inventory data which is then transmitted to a wholesaler to replinish the product.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO DRAWINGS<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the<br>
ensuing description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and<br>
wherein:<br>
Fig. 1. Shows a block diagram of the device of the present invention.<br>
Referring to the drawing, the  device comprises a first storage chamber SC1 adapted to store a plurality of first products therein. The device further  comprises a second storage chamber SC2 adopted to store a plurality of a second products. Though Fig. 1 illustrates only a first storage chamber SC1 and second storage chamber SC2, the device may comprise only a single storage chamber SC1 or more then two storage chambers.<br>
Each of the storage chambers has its own respective first sensor S1 and second sensor S2. Alternatively, first and second sensors may each comprise a plurality of sensors Sensor S1 is normally located at the inlet end of the chamber to determine the quantitative number of the products introduced into the chamber. Second sensor S2 is normally located at the outlet end to determine the quantitative number of products removed from the chamber, which is the consumption data.<br>
The signals from sensors S1 and S2 from each of the storage chambers are fed to a microcontroller MC through encoders EN. Microcontroller MC is connected to a keyboard KB, a power source PS being provided therefor. Microcontroller MC may have a printer  PR and a display D, as normally known in the art.<br>
An E-Prom EP having a software is connected to micro controller. Such features of the device are provided in a first location havng said storage chambers. The first   location<br>
may be the house of a consumer having a plurality of such chambers connected to the<br>
microcontroller MC. Alternatively, the first location now the  shelf of a store having a plurality of chambers to store different products.<br>
The device further comprises a signal means, or an auto dialer connected to micro controller MC and disposed at a second location. Thus, the signal means of auto dialer AT provides a signal to allow a replenishment of the product.<br>
The communication port such as RS.232, RF/IR/RFID also been provided with microcontroller to enable transmission of data stored to another device.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates that two sensors S1 and S2 are provided with each storage chamber. However, depending upon the product, one or more such sensors may be provided.<br><br><br><br>
 WE CLAIM<br>
1.	An inventory control device comprising:<br>
a storage chamber (SC1) having atleast one sensor (S1/ S2), located at a first location for providing signals of the consumption of the product within said storage chamber (SC1), a receiver system (RC) for receiving the signals from said storage chamber (SC1) and said receiver system (RC) adapted to be in communication with a distal location for providing data of the consumption of the product.<br>
2.	A device as claimed in claim 1 storage chamber (SC1) having a<br>
