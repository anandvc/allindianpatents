Novel problotics for pet food applications<br>
The present invention relates to novel lactic acid bacteria and particularly micro-organisins' of the genera Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus (Enterococcus) that have been isolated and selected for their probiotic potential. The present invention also relates to their use in the preparation of petfood compositions intended to improve the health of pets and to compositions containing the same. Methods of maintaining or improving pet health through feeding a pet such micro-organisms are also provided*<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The well-being of domestic animals is closely related to their feeding. Correct feeding should result in a fit and healthy pet. In addition to providing nutritional value, food composition influences the intestinal microflora equilibrium and may lead to or prevent gastrointestinal disorders. Therefore, knowledge on die gastro-intestinal tract and digestion processes of healthy animals is integral to the understanding of a practical feeding practice. As meat-eaters, cats and dogs are characterized by a short digestive tract and a rapid flow rate of the bolus of food.<br>
Among the constituents of the gastrointestinal microflora of cats and dogs Bacteroides sp., Clostridium sp., Enterobacteriaceae, Bifidobacterium sp,, Lactobacillus sp., Streptococcus sp,, Staphylococcus sp. and yeasts can be recovered.<br>
The number and composition of this endogenous flora tend to be rather stable, althougih age and, to a lesser degree, food may modify it. Gastric acidity, bile, intestinal peristalsis and local immunity are factors thought to be important in the regulation of bacterial flora in the small intestine of human beings and various other mammals.<br>
Often canine and feline gastrointestinal disorders are linked to bacterial overgrowth and the production of enterotoxins produced by pathogenic bacteria.<br><br>
During the last few years research has focused on some valuable strains of lactic acid bacteria and their potential use as probiotic agents, Probiotics are considered to be viable microbial preparations which promote mammalian health by presereiving the natural microflora in the intestine. Probiotics are bought to attach to the intestinal mucosa, colonize the intestinal tract and thereby prevent attachment of harmful micro-organisms thereon. A prerequisite for their action resides in that they have to reach the gut's mucosa in a proper and viable form and especially do not get destroyed by the influence of the low pH prevailing in the stomach. In particular, the physiology of the digestive tract of cats and dogs differs from humans. For example, the average pH in the stomach is about 3.4 for dogs and 4.2 for cats..<br>
Although US 5968569 discloses the inclusion of a probiotic micro-organism in a pet food cereal, neither it, nor the remaining available art provides information concerning strains specifically intended for pet health.<br>
r<br>
Consequently, there is a need to provide novel bacterial strains that are particularly adapted for pets and that have been selected for their high probiotic properties beneficial for pet health and to incorporate these strains into a pet food composition.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a novel probiotic micro-organism of lactic acid bacteria, selected for its ability to survive and colonize the gastrointestinal tract of a pet and to exert a beneficial probiotic activity on pet health.<br>
The probiotic strain may be selected from lactobacilli, bifidobacteria or Bnterococci.<br>
The probiotic strain may be selected from the group consisting of Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus acidophilusy Lactobacillus animalis, Lactobacillus ruminis, Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasein Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus fermentum and Bifidobacterium spp., Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus spp*<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment the probiotic strain is selected firom the group consisting of Lactobacillus reuteri (NCC2581 ; CNCM 1-2448), Lactobacillus reuteri (NCC2592; CNCM 1-2450), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (NCC2583; CNCM 1-2449), Lactobacillus reuteri (NCC2603; CNCM I-2451), Lactobacillus reuteri (NCC2613; CNCM 1-2452), Lactobacillus acidophilus (NCC2628; CNCM 1-2453), Bifidobacterium adolescentis (e.g. NCC2627), Bifidobacterium sp. NCC2657 or Enterococcus faecium SF68 (NCIMB 10415).<br>
The novel bacterial strain may be used in any amount from about 1.0Ef04 to about l.OE+12 cfu/animal and day and preferably from l.OE+05 to about l.OE+11 cfu/animal and day, most preferably from l.OEiO? to l.OE+10 cfu/ animal and day.<br>
In one aspect the invention relates to the use of the bacterial strain as described above and/or their supernatant of culture and/or their metabolites, for the preparation of a composition intended for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of disorders associated with the colonization of the gastrointestinal tract of pets by pathogenic micro-organisms- Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, reference to "strain" should be understood to include its supernatant of culture and/or a^metabolite thereof.<br>
In another aspect, the invention relates to the use of the bacterial strain as described above and/or their supernatant of culture and/or a metabolite thereof, for the preparation of a composition intended for regulating the immune response of pets. By the term "regulating" the immime response, it is meant that the bacterial strains described above and/or their supernatant of culture and/or their metabolites have the capacity to either stimulate certain immune functions that are important to the pets health or modulate other immune functions that could potentially be implicated in immune disorders, such as inflammation, allergy, etc. The stimulation or modulation of these immune functions can be achieved by using different combinations of the bacterial strains described above and/or their supernatant of culture and/or their metabolites.<br>
The invention further provides a method of maintaining or improving die health of the gastrointestinal tract, tiae skin and/or coat system or the immune<br><br>
system of a pet comprising the step of feeding a pet a pet food composition containing at least one isolated strain as described above.<br>
In additibff, the invention provides a method for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of disorders associated with the colonization of the gastrointestinal tract of pets by pathogenic micro-organisms, comprising the step of feeding a pet a pet food composition containing at least one isolated strain according to the present invention.<br>
The invention also provides a method of regulating the immime response in pets» comprising the step of feeding a pet a pet food composition containing at least one isolated strain according to the present invention. #<br>
The invention also provides a method of ameliorating or reducing the<br>
effects of ageing in a pet comprising the step of feeding a pet a pet food<br>
»<br>
composition containing at least one isolated strain according to the present invention.<br>
These selected micro-organisms have a particular beneficial impact on pets in their gastrointestinal tract, on their skin and/or coat, on their immune system, and on the effects of ageing.<br>
They have a particular beneficial impact on intestinal pathogens such as strains Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli. Shigella dysenteriaea or other pathogenic enterobacterieceae colonizing pets or parasites such as helminths (Toxocara spp,), protozoan (Cryptosporidium spp, Giardia spp., Pentatrichomonas hominis, Entamoeba histolytica. Toxoplasma gondii^ ,„) or yeasts.<br>
Combined with food, these micro-organisms particularly exert their probiotic beneficial effects on palatabillty, digestion and gut health, immune function and sanitary conditions, the latter by way of contributing to a reduction of fecal volume and at least a partial deodorization of canine faeces. Thus, according to a second aspect of the invention, a petfood composition comprises a micro-organism having high probiotic activity in pets and being capable of surviving and colonizing the gastrointestinal tract of a pet ingesting it.<br><br>
Accordingly, the invention relates to a petfood composition intended for the heatlh of the gastrointestinal tract of pets, containing at least one probiotic strain isolated as described above and/or a supernatant of its culture and/or a metabolite thereof, associated with an ingestible support or a pharmaceutical matrix.<br>
Also, the invention relates to a petfood composition intended for the regulation of the immune response of pets, containing at least one isolated strain as described above and/or a supernatant of its culture and/or a metabolite thereof, associated with an ingestible support or a pharmaceutical matrix.<br>
Also, the invention relates to a petfood composition intended for ameliorating or reducing the effects of ageing in pets, containing at least one isolated strain as described above and/or a supernatant of its culture and/or a metabolite thereof, associated with an ingestible support or a pharmaceutical matrix*<br>
Finally, the invention relates to a petfood composition intended for the health of the skin and/or coat of pets, containing at least one isolated strain as described above and/or a supernatant of its culture and/or a metabolite thereof, associated with ah ingestible support or a pharmaceutical matrix.<br>
In an embodiment, the ingestible support comprises a nutritionally balanced pet food composition. The said composition preferably contains sufficient amount of the isolated strain, it supernatant of culture and/or a metabolite thereof, to be effective in providing the said prophylactic effect when the composition is fed to a pet as a complete meal.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
Within the following description, the abbreviation cfu ("colony-forming-unit**) designates the number of bacterial cells as revealed by microbiological counts on agar plates.<br>
Moreover, "NCC" designates Nesti6 Culture Collection (Nesfl6 Research Center, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Lausanne, Switzerland).<br><br>
With respect to the first object of the present invention, 20 lactobacilli and 18 bifidobacteria isolated &amp;om cat and dog faeces, were screened and selected with regard to their technological and physiological parameters.<br>
V^       iFft^<br>
A first screening for potential probiotic applications was performed in-vitro (see examples 1 and 2): growth characteristics, tolerance to gastric acidity at different pHs and different concentrations of biliary salts present in the duodenum likely to be found in cats and dogs.<br>
Furthermore, the good survival of freeze-dried cells in two different cryoprotective media was clearly demonstrated at 4**C and 20°C as indicated by an accelerated storage test*<br>
These strains can be characterized by short generation times, high counts (more th^ l.OE+08 cfu/ml) during their stationary phase and stability in high numbers at 8 and 24 h post-inoculation, stability to freeze-drying followed by either storage-conditions, resistance to physiological bile concentrations found in the duodenum (2% bile) and their low inhibition when grown in presence of up to 4% bile. Furthermore, results fix)m DNA analyses were taken into account to select bacteria reoresentative of the investigated diversity.<br>
The strains intended for cat and dog health can grow up to at least LOE+06 cfu/ml in the presence of up to 2.0 % bile salts* The strains can also grow up to at least l,0E+06 cfu/ml after about 2 hours at a pH-range from about 3.4 to about 4.2.<br>
The bacterial strains according to the invention may be selected &amp;om the group consisting of Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus acidophilus^ Lactobacillus animalis, Lactobacillus ruminis, Lactobacillus johnsonii^ Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasein Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus fermentum, Bifidobacterium sp., Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus sp.<br>

In another embodiment, the present invention relates to the use of bacterial strains as described above, for the preparation of a food composition capable of improving or maintaining pet health.<br>
They can be used in their viable form, inactivated form, as a supernatant of a culture or fractions thereof, e.g. cell walls, peptidoglycan, cytoplasm, purified proteins, functional metabolites, bioactive molecules.<br>
They are preferably used in an amount of from about l.OE+04 cfu/g to about l.OB+11 cfu/g and preferably from LOE+05 cfu/g to about l.OE+10 cfu/g, most preferably from LOE+06 cfu/g to l.OE+09 cfu/g.<br>
0<br>
In a preferred embodiment, they may be used as dietary adjuncts so as to improve pet food quality and may be included in an amount of from about l,0E+04-'cfu/g to about LOE+11 cfu/g. As dietary adjuncts, they may be encapsulated or may be provided in powder form and packaged in conjunction with or separately from a main meal, be it wet or dry. By way of example, a powder containing selected micro-organisms according to the invention, or components or moities of the supernatant of their cultures or selected metabolites, may be packed in sachets in a powder form or in a gel or lipid or other suitable carrier. These separately packaged units may be provided together with a main meal or in multi-imit packs for use with a main meal or treat, according to user instructions. In another example, the probiotic straiii/s may be provided in a multi-chamber packaging unit together with a second ingestible component, for example a wet or medium moisture content chunky meal or a meal-sized batch of dried kibbles in a flexible pouch configuration. A first chamber in the pouch would contain the probiotic strain and a second, separate sealed chamber the second ingestible component.<br>
These selected micro-organisms have a particular beneficial impact in pets on their gastrointestinal tract, on their skin and/or coat, on their immune system, on dental or oral health, on their bones and on the effects of ageing.<br>
They are also found to improve palatability of food, digestion, inmiunc function and sanitary conditions (reduction of fecal volume and pardal deodorization of canine faeces) m pets.<br><br>
The present invention also relates to a pet food composition for improving or maintaining the health of pets containing at least one probiotic strain having the above traits, associated with an ingestible support or a pharmaceutical matrix.<br>
At least one bacterial strain having the above traits and/or its supernatant of culture or a fraction thereof and/or its metabolites may be administered to the pet as a supplement to the its normal diet or as a component of a nutritionally complete pet food.<br>
The nutritionally complete pet food composition according to tlie invention may be in powdered, dried form or a wet, chilled or.6helf stable pet food product. These pet foods may be produced by ways known in \hc art provided that where micro-organism activity is desired, care is taken to ensure survival of the micro-organism. Apart from the bacteria strains and/or its fermented medium, these pet foods may include any one or more of a stmcli source, a protein source and lipid source.<br>
Suitable starch sources are, for example, grains and legumes such as com, rice, wheat, barley, oats, soy, and mixtures of these.<br>
Suitable protein sources may be selected from any suitable animal or vegetable protein source; for example meat and meal, poultry meal, fish aieal, soy protein concentrates, milk proteins, gluten, and the like.   For elderly animMs, it is preferred for the protein source to contain a high quality protein-Suitable hpid sources include meats, animal fats and vegetable fats.<br>
The choice of the starch, protein and lipid sources will be laigely determined by the nutritional needs of the animal, palatability considerations, and the type of product applied. For elderly pets, the pet food preferal)ly contains proportionally less fat than pet foods for younger pets. Furtlienuorc, the starch sources may include one or more of rice, barley, wheat and corn.<br>
Further, various other ingredients, for example, sugar, salt, spices, seasonings, vitamins, minerals, flavouring agents, fats and the like may also be incorporated into the pet food as desired*<br><br>
For dried pet foods a suitable process is extrusion cooking, although bakmg and other suitable processes may be used. When extrusion cooked, tlic dried pet food is usually provided in the form of a kibble. If a prebioLic carbohydrate is^ed, the prebiotic may be mixed with the other ingredients of the dried pet food prior to processing. A suitable process is described in European patent application No 0850569; the disclosure of which is iocorporated by reference- If a probiotic micro-organism is used and activity is desired in the final product, the organism is best coated onto or filled into tlie dried pet food. A suitable process is described in European patent appUcation No 0862863; the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference. Where survival of the micro-organism is not required, it may be added to the pre extrusion mix, as may the supernatant of its culture or metabolite, as desired.<br>
For wet foods, the processes described in US patents 4,781,939 und 5,132,137 may be used to.produce simulated meat products. The disclosures of these patents are incorporated by reference. Other procedures for producing chunk type products may also be used; for example cooking in a steam oven. Alternatively, loaf type products may be produced by emulsifying a suitable meat material to produce a meat emulsion, adding a suitable gelling agent, and heating the meat emulsion prior to filling into cans or other containers. As in the case of producing dried pet foods, where survival of the probiotic species chosen is not essential, it may be added to the feed mix prior to cooking or heating, or at any appropriate or convenient stage in the production process.<br>
The amount of prebiotic in the pet food is preferably less than about 20% by weight and further preferably less than about 10% by weight. For example, the prebiotic may comprise from about 0.1% to about 5% by weight of die pet food. For pet foods which use chicory as the prebiotic, the chicory may be included to comprise from about 0.5% to about 10% by weight of the feed mixture; more preferably from about 1% to about 5% by weight.<br>
The pet foods may contain other active agents such as long chain faiiy acids. Suitable long chain fatty acids include alpha-linoleic acid, gamma-linoleic acid, linoleic acid, eicosapentanoic acid, and docosahexanoic acid. Fish oils are a suitable source of eicosapentanoic acids and docosahexanoic acid. Borage oil, blackcurrent seed oil and evening primrose oil are suitable sources of gamma-linoleic acid. Safflower oils, sunflower oils, corn oils and soy bean oils are suitable sources of linoleic acid.<br><br>
If necessary, the pet foods are supplemented with minerals and vitamins so that fhey are nutritionally complete.<br>
Furthermore, if desired, the bacteria strain may be encapsulated; for example in a sugar matrix, fat matrix or polysaccharide matrix. It may also be coated as described in EP 862 863,<br>
The novel probiotic strain is preferably used so that the pet food preferably contains about l.OE+04 to about LOE+10 cells of the probiotic micro-organism per gram of the pet food; more preferably about L0E^^06 to about l.OE+08 cells of probiotic micro-organism per gram, Tha pet food may contain about 0,005% to about 10% by weight of the mixture of the probiotic micro-organism- It preferably contains about 0.02% to about 6% by weight and most preferably about 1% to about 6% by weight.<br>
The amount of pet food to be consumed by the pet to obtain a beneficial effect will depend on the size or the pet, the type of pet, and age of the pel. However, an amount of the pet food to provide a daily amount of about L0E+03-1-0E+14 cfu'of at least one lactic acid bacteria strain and/or the equivalent fermentation medium, would usually be adequate. Preferably about l.OE+09 to l.OE+11 cfu /day for dogs or LOE+07 to LOE+IO cfu /day for cats are administred.<br>
The composition according to the invention has a high probiotic activity and/or is found to be particularly effective for improving and/or maintaining healthy digestive function in pets, and improving and maintaining the gastrointestinal tract, skin and/or coat, and / or immune system, health ol pets. This composition has also a beneficial impact on effects of ageing in cats and dogs.<br>

Numerous strains (from the Nesti6 culture collection - NCC) were screened for their potential probiotic use for cats and dogs* In particulai-, growth potentials, resistance to freeze-drying with subsequent storage, tolerance to gastric acidity and different concentrations of bile salts found in the gastrointestinal tract of cats and dogs, were assessed for tiiose 20 lactobacilU and 18 bifidobacteria isolated from cat and dog faeces presented in Table h<br>
Table 1:<br>
Codes and characteristics of bacteria selected for the assays<br><br><br><br>
All 20 lactobaciUi and 18 bifidobacteria were isolated from cats and dogs kept on different diets, as shown in Table 1. Initial identification was determined by morphological and physiological characteristics, API-50CH and Rapid-IDJiA systems (BioM6rieux) were used for lactobaciUi and bifidobacteria, respectively. Pure strains were frozen and deposited at -80°C in the Nestec-Culture-CoUection (NCC).<br>
All bacteria were cultured in broth-medium for the assays. A sample from each reactivated strain was stored at -80^C in 1 ml-cryoprotective media (40% glycerol -f 60% LL). The cultures were maintained by subculturing on a weekly base a 1% inocula in 10 ml-growth medium and anaerobic incubation<br>
at sra<br>
Lactobacilli were grown in MRS for 18 hours. Bifidobacteria were grown either in MRS + 0.05% (w/v) L-cysteine hydrochloride (MRS-C) for 32 hours or in BHI + 0.05% L-cysteine hydrochloride (BHI-C) for 48 hours starting with a 5% inoculum.<br>
All cultures were stored at +4*'C between the different transfers. Anaerobiosis was generally obtained using a hydrogen-carbon dioxide anaerobic system (GasPak, Becton Dickinson, USA). Bifidobacteria were always kept in these jars during their storage period.<br>
Example 2: Selection of bacterial strains<br>
This in-vitro screening was based on production characteristics for an industrial application of viable cells, their ability to survive inhibitmg or detrimental gastro-intestinal conditions and their genomic diversity. Strain diversity or genomic similarity of those non-characterized strains was taken into account, using RAPD and ribotyping.<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
^Bacterial growth<br>
The strains that are able to produce rapidly high number of cells have to be identified. Their bacterial growth cycle can be characterized by a short lag phase, a short generation time, high maximal counts and a long stationary phase. Therefore, strains were compared by considering three variables: the<br><br>
length of their lag phase, their generation time (in hours) and their maxinial counts, which corresponded to the most important characteristics.<br>
For LactcbacUUT<br>
200 ml MRS broth preincubated at 3TC was inoculated with 1% of a fresh subculture. ,One ml samples were collected at every hour post-inoculation for eight hours. A final sample was taken after 24 h. One ml of each sample was 10-fold serially diluted m TS for enumeration. Cultures were grown in MRS agar (pour-plating technique), anaerobically, at 3TC, for 48 hours. All plates with colony-numbers between 30 and 350 were recorded as colony forming units (cfu) per ml of culture and were therefore taken into consideration for enumerations.<br>
For bifidobacteria in (MRS-C):<br>
In preliminary assays, all strains were enumerated after 24 h growth in MRS-C and TPYG broth. Results were expressed in cfu/ml. The growth curves were established by determining the cell numbers when grown in MRS-C after 0, 4,12, 24, 32 and 48 h, according to the protocol described for lactobacilli. In order to determine the influence of the subculture medium and of optimization of degassing the growth medium, this assay was realized:<br>
•	from a subculture, in BHI-C stored 48 h at 4°C, and inoculated in<br>
MRS-C<br>
•	from a subculture, in BHI-C stored 48 h at 4'*C, and inoculated in<br>
MRS-C well degassed (removal of oxygen had been optimized by<br>
autoclaving the medium twice and storing it directly in anaerobic<br>
jars)<br>
•	from a fresh subculture, in MRS, and inoculated in MRS-C well<br>
degassed and stored under anaerobic conditions before the<br>
experiment<br><br><br><br>
Solid media were obtained by, the addition of Difco Bacto agar (15 gJ"/<br>
^). Media were autoclaved  at  121X for  15  min.  Liquid media fot	<br>
bifidobacteria were either stored under anaerobic conditions or degassed before utilization.<br>
Resistance to gastric pH and bile<br>
■^	•	•■<br>
When ingested, the micro-organisms have to survive stomach and duodenimi conditions to be able to exert a beneficial activity in the gastro-intestmal tract of the animal. Gastric pH and biliary salts are the main components responsible for regulation of bacterial flora. Therefore, the degree of resistance of the strains to acidity and bile has to be assayed.<br>
The physiology of the digestive tract of cats and dogs differ from humans. The average pH were pH 3.4 and 4.2 respectively in dogs and cats. A reconstituted pet bile was recommended for the assays (Table 4). The bile concentration in the small intestine varies in a range of 0.5 to 2% when food is digested.<br>
According to extreme pH values found in cats and dogs, viable counts after 10 minutes at pH 2.6 and after two hours at either pH 3.4 (strains isolated from dogs) or pH 4.2 (strains isolated from cats) should not be below l.OE+06 cfii/ml.<br><br>
•	Resistance to gastric pH<br>
AU lactobaciUi were inoculated at 1% in MRS broth and grown anaerobically at 37°C overnight. Bifidobacteria, inoculated at 5% in BHI-C, were grown 48 hours at 37*^0 under anaerobic conditions. The cultures were dispensed in two ml reaction tubes (Eppendorf) and centrifuged at 3,500xg / 10 min / 20^C. Cells were washed three times with Ringer-solution. The resistance to stomach acidic conditions was assayed in-vitro in three simulated gastric juices with pH levels of 2.6, 3.4 and 4.2 adjusted witii HCl (Merck). Disposable fijterware (Nalgene) was used for all filter-sterilizations. The survival of each bacterial suspension was studied by adding^one ml into a series of five ml of simulated gastric juice (different pHs) supplemented with L5 ml of a 0.5 % NaCl solution.<br>
The samples were incubated at 37°C and the viable organisms enumerated at:<br>
•	0,1,5,10 minutes with the pH 2,6 gastric juice<br>
•	Oy 1, 30,60,120,180 minutes when the gastric juice had a pH of either 3.4 (for strains isolated from dogs) or 4.2 (for strains isolated from cats)<br>
Samples were diluted in phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), plated onto MRS-C agar and enumerated.<br><br>
•	Resistance to bile salts<br>
The evolution of the viable counts of lactobacilli grown for 18 hours in presence of various concentrations of reconstituted pet bile was determined.<br>
Two viable counts were considered significantly different when the deviation of then: logio was above 0.25. Each strain was characterized by two variables:<br><br>
•	the maximal bile salt concentration tested where no significative difference with the control was found<br>
•	the rate of the decrease in viability when bile concentration in the growth medium increases<br>
The strains characterized by a loss superior to a logio of their viable counts when bile concentration raises in 1% steps were considered sensitive to bile. A reduction superior to one logio between cells grown in presence of 0 and 2% bile, and to one logio P^ additional percent of bile (above 2%) was considered acceptable. Furthermore, only strains producing more than LOE+06 cfu/ml when grown in presence of up to 2% bile salts should be selected, in order to produce an effect in the gastrointestinal tra^t<br>
Reconstituted pet bile from cats or dogs was prepared as indicated in Table 4, aQd filter sterilized prior to use. In a first assay^ lactobaciUi were grown anaerobically for 24 hours in MRS broth at 37°C and transferred into fresh MRS broth plus 0, 0.1, 03, 0.5,1, 2,4% sterile reconstituted pet bile for additional 18 hours. Samples were 10-fold serially diluted in TS for enumeration. Dilutions l.OB-03 and l.OE-05 were plated onto MRS agar, using a WASP (« Whitley Automatic Spiral Plater »; Don Whitley Scientific Limited, Edgland). When dried, the plates were inverted and incubated 48 hours at 37°C in anaerobic jars.<br>
Floch and al. (1972) defined an inhibition as significant when at least 2 logs in the test con^&gt;ared with the control tube growth were reduced. Based on this, all the lactobaciUi sensitive to bile concentrations in the first assay and two lactobaciUi resistant to 4% bile were tested similarly in presence of 0,1,1.5, 2, 2.5, 3,4% bUe. The second test aimed for a repeatabiUty and established if the number of viable bacteria decreased dramaticaUy with increasing bUe concentration.<br>
On the other hand, it pointed out that these strains are bUe-resistant during this 18 h-period. Growth curves were estabUshed in presence of bUe salts to determine if the lag phase and the growth rate were affected or not Assays were undertaken with lactobaciUi grown in MRS broth supplemented with 1% reconstituted pet bUe, according to the protocol described for earUer growth measurement.<br><br>
The bifidobacteria were subcultured and grown 32 hours/ YI^'QI anaerobicaUy, using MRS-C broth with 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4% reconstituted pet bile. The same enumeration method at dilutions l.OE-03, l,0E-04 and hOE-05 was applied as for lactobacilli.<br><br>
•Survival to freeze^drying and subsequent storage of the Lactobadllus strains<br>
The evolution of survival was evaluated. Viable counts inferior to lOE+05 CFU/ml were considered as being too low.<br>
For each strain, 200 ml MRS broth was inoculated at 3% with a fresh subculture. The cultures were grown "for 16 hours at 37^C. Unaerated conditions (closeil containers) were assumed to be essentially anaerobic. Viable cells wereenumerated, using the pour-plating method described earlier.<br>
The cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 3,500xg / ^TC I 20 minutes (RC3C Sorvall Instrument centrifuge) and resuspended in 10 ml of two different cryoprotective media. Each strain was resuspended in two different cryoprotectants. Concentrated bacterial suspensions were enumerated (pour plating method) and dispensed into vials (0.5 ml per ampoule). The samples were frozen at -196°C in Uquid nitrogen and vacuum dried for 18 hours. After freeze-drying, nitrogen was introduced through the freeze-drier air-admittance valve and all ampoules were sealed. All vials were stored at +4'C and +20^C for six months. The number of viable cells per ampoule (for each bacteria and suspension media) was determined monthly.<br>
RESULTS<br><br>
In the frame of the selection of potential probiotics for cats and dogs, the results of this in-vitro screening of 20 lactobacilli and 18 bifidobacteria, based on their growth potentials, resistance to fireeze-drying with subsequent storage, resistance to gastric pH and bile concentrations found in the gastro¬intestinal tract of cats and dogs are presented in Table 5.<br>
The 20 lactobacilli were classified with regard to the criteria that they fulfilled in the current study. Four strains showed had good results concerning their growth characteristics, resistance to gastric pH, bile resistance and their survival during storage after to freeze-drymg: L reuteri NCC2581 (CNCMI-2448), L. reuteri NCC2592 (CNCM 1-2450), L reuteri NCC2603 (CNCM I-2451) and L reuteri NCC2613 (CNCM 1-2452). The following features were complied:<br>
•	the generation time was less than one hour when grown in MRS<br>
•	the lag phase was short (less than two hours)<br>
•	the bacterial counts were high (more than LOE+08 CFU/ml) during the stationary phase of the growth cycle and stable at 8 and 24 h post-inoculation<br>
•	the strains were stable through freeze-drying and subsequent six-month storage at 4'C and 20°C<br>
•	the strains were resistant to extreme bile concentration likely to be found in the gastrointestmal tract of cats and dogs (2%)<br>
•	no significant inhibition in the presence of up to 4% bile in the medium<br>
•	the strains were shown to tolerate pH 2.6 for at least 10 min and could remain at levels higher tiian LOE+08 CFU/ml<br>
•	the strains were resistant to an average gastric pH for at least two hours<br>
Therefore, two lactobacilli isolated firom cats (L. reuteri NCC2581 and L reuteri NCC2592) and two isolated from dogs (L reuteri NCC2603 and L reuteri NCC2613) were selected to be studied for potential probiotic activity. Strains NCC2581, NCC2592, NCC2603 and NCC2613 were identified as L reuteri by API 50CH identification. However, ribotyping revealed that NCC2581 and NCC2592 had very close patterns, as well as NCC2603 and NCC2613, thus indicating a probable close relationship. Strain NCC2581 had very good growth characteristics and NCC2603 had a better resistance to bile tiian NCC2613.<br><br>
Results concerning . the eight bifidobacteria isolated from cats feces allowed a selection in function of their growth characteristics, their resistance to gastric pH and their bile sensitivity. Strain NCC2623 had none of the desired characteristics, and would therefore not be recommended for further studies. On the other hand, strain NCC2627 fulfilled all the criteria:<br>
•	its generation time was less than one hour when grown in MRS-C<br>
•	the lag phase was as short as for lactobacilli<br>
•	counts were high and stable during the stationary phase of the growth cycle<br>
•	the strain was resistant to extreme bile concentration likely to be found in the gastro-intestinal tract of cats and dogs (2%)<br>
•	no significant inhibition in the presence of up to 4% bile in the medium<br>
•	the strain was shown to tolerate pH 2*6 for at least 10 4nin and could remain at levels higher than l,0E4O6 CFU/ml<br>
•	the strains were resistant to an average gastric pH for at least two hours<br>
The strain NCC2627 was much more resistant than NCC2623 and NCC263S, whereas these three strains had close pattern by ribotyping, th€a:efore indicating a probable close relationship (digestion with two restriction enzymes : EcoKl and EcoRV).<br>
The ten'bifidobacteria isolated fi:om dogs showed only two different patterns when characterized by ribotyping. Therefore, bile resistance assays were conducted only with four strains (two from each group): NCC2657; NCC2660, NCC2671 and NCC2677. These four strains were all resistant to maximal concentration of bile that could be found in-vivo (2% bile) and strains NCC2660 and NCC2657 had no decrease in viable counts when subjected to a maximal value of 4% bile. As a consequence, all the bifidobacteria isolated from dogs feces are rather resistant to high concentrations of bile.<br>
Regardmg the growth characteristics, these ten bacteria could thereby be divided into two groups :<br>
•	strains resistant to bUe and with good growth characteristics: NCC2657.<br>
NCC2651, NCC2663 and NCC2667<br>
•	strains resistant to bile but with growth characteristics which need to be<br>
optimized for industrial production: NCC2660, NCC2671, NCC2677,<br>
NCC2647, NCC2654 and NCC2674.<br><br><br><br>
9 Bol- portions were dispensed in tubes and autoclaved at 121^C for 15 min,<br>
Finally^v 8. of the 38 strains were selected for further studies (see Exan^le 3): three lactobacilli isolated from cats (NCC2581, NCC2592, NCC2583), three lactobacilU from dogs (NCC2603. NCC2613, NCC2628), one bifidobacteria from cats (NCC2627) and one bifidobacteria from dogs<br>
(NCC2657,).<br>
These strains are characterized by short generation times, high counts (more than LOE+08 cfu/ml) during their stationary phase and stability in high numbers at 8 and 24 h post-inoculation, stability to freeze-drying followed by either storage-conditions, resistance to extreme bile-concentrations found in the duodenum (2% bile) and their low inhibition when grown in presence of up to 4% bile. Furthermore, results from DNA analyses were taken into account to select bacteria representative of the investigated diversity.<br>

L. reuteri NCC2581, L reuteri NCC2592, L. rhamnosus NCC2583 and Bifidobacterium sp. NCC2627 were tested in feeding trials so as to evaluate their capacity to survive the passage of the cat gastrointestinal tract<br>
16 cats male and female as equal as possible were subjected to 3 days of adaptation with Friskies Grand menu boeuf. The feeding protocol, consisted in 7 days with 'Friskies Gratid Menu" and 7 days of test with "Friskies Grand Menu" containing one of the above mentioned strains; L reuteri NCC2581 (diet A), L reuteri NCC2592 (diet B), L rhamnosus NCC2583 (diet C) and Bifidobacterium sp. NCC2627 (diet D). The diet assigment was the following:<br><br>
The said strains were prepared in a sufficient amount and in a stable lyophilized form to apply these eight different bacteria with regard to strain-survival in tiie gastrointestinal tract of the tested animals. All strains were mixed with 4 g of trehalose in order to add a sufficient volume of carrier for<br><br>
mixing the prepared strains with the food-matrix for the animals. Bacteria strains are prepared in individual plastic tubes (LOE+09 cfu /day) and daily added in a part of title food to be sure that total bacteria will be eaten.<br>
Fresh fecal samples are obtained to analyze bacterial population numbers and compared with base line (without bacteria added). Feces are collected on day 7 and 8 (base line).<br>

This solution is then transferred into 1 ml cryotubes and frozen in liquid nitrogen. All samples are tiben stored at ' ^0°C until analysis.<br>
The endogenous populations of Lactobacilli, Bacteroides, Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococci, Bifidobacteria and Clostridium perfringens were counted. Bacteria were detected on selective or semi-selective media. Hundredfold serial dilutions were performed in Ringer solution containing 0.5% of cystein, from the dilutions in the range -2 to -8. Petri dishes of various selective media were inoculated and incubated (see Table below).<br><br><br>

During treatment we observe no major change in die fecal counts of lactobacilli, due to the ingestions of the selected problotic bacteria except in the case of the strain L. acidophilus NCC2628. Under the tested conditions the inliibitory effect on C. perfringens was not significant as the basal level of C. perfringens were very low. We observe no di'astic increase in count of linterubacteriaceae reflecting that there is no disturbance of tlic intestinal ecosystem related to the use of the selected problotics.<br>
llxainple 5 : Effect of Lactobadlli and their metabolites on the viability of Giardia intestinalis<br>
We studied the effect of culture filtrate supernatants ol' Lactobacilli sUaLus isolated from cats and dogs.<br>
Muleriai and methods<br>
Bacterial strains and cultures : Micro-organisms belonging to the genus Lactobacillus were from tlie Nestl6 Culture Collection. Bacteria were grown in MTYl medium. Supernatants containing metabolites of lactobacilli were ucutialized at pH 6 and filter sterilized.<br>
Controls were performed by acidifying MTYl medium with lactic acid U) tlic same pH than the one of the bacterial cultures. Afterwards, pit was adjusted to pH 6 with 0,1 N NaOH; Origin of the strain under study imd pH of supernatmits and controls ai'e shown in table 9.<br><br><br>
Parasites: Giordiii intestinalis strain WB (ATCC 3U957) was purcliascd u&gt; Auicricaa Type Culture Collection (Rockvillc, USA). Trojohozoites were grown in Keistcr's modified TYI-S-33 medium coniaiaing-i^cr liter: casein digest (Diico), 20g ; yeast extract (BBL), lOg ; dcxUose (Merck), lOg ; bovine liilc (Difco), 0.75g ; NaCl (Merck), 2g ; L-cystein.HCl (Sigma), 2g ; ascorbic acjd sodium salt (Fluka), 0.2g ; K2HPO4 (Merck), 0.6g ; ferric ammonium citrate (Sigma), 22.8 mg ; adult bovine serum (Sigma), 100 ml ; penicillin/ strcplomycme (Gibco, 1000 lU/ml, 10(X)|ag/ml), 15 ml. pH was adjusted to 6.9 Willi NaOH 5N prior to filter sterilization (0.22 ^im pore size).<br>
Parasites were cultured in polystirene tissue culture flasks (LUX, Miles Lal)icalories. Inc. Naperville IL 60540) filled with 40 ml of culture medium. Subcultures were performed by discarding supernatant will) non ;Utaclied paiasiLcs, adding 5 ml of ice-cold cultm'e medium, incubating in an ice bath !oi 10 mill to detach adherent ti'ophozoites and inoculating 0.2 ml of the icsulting suspension into fresh medium. Incubations were performed at 37^'C in Uie dark.<br>
Proliferation assays: Two hundred microliters of trophozoite suspensions ilA X 10^ parasitcs/nil) were mixed with 100 |al of supernatants or controls and 1 fiCi of li tliymidine was added. Samples were incubated at 3T'C for 24 lioiiis in y6-well tissue culture plates (Nunc Brand Products). Ilien, parasites vvc! c hiirvested and thymidine incoiporation was evaluated.<br>
Results<br><br>
Thymidiae incorporation is shown in Table 10. The stiain NCC 2628 isolated ftom a dog produced a strong inhibition of the prolilcratioa of WIJ strain (91%), Other strains studied did not inhibit trophozoite growtli.<br><br>
In this experiment it could be demonstrated that funciional metabolites produced during growth of L. acidophilus NCC 2628 have a very sUong inhibitory effect on the growth of Giardia intestinalis.<br>
Examples 6 to 8: Inhibitory Effects of lactobacillus strains accorduig to the invention on intestinal pathogenic bacteria<br>
To identify strains with strong antagonistic properties against small intestinal pathogens, co-cultivation experiments were performed in a model system simulating canine small intestinal conditions (pH, bile composition imd concentration, mucin, pancreatin). Simulated canine small intestinal jnice contained reconstituted canine bile (0.345 g/1 taurochenodeoxycholate, Sign^a, Gennany; 0.7 g/1 taurodeoxycholate, Sigma, Germany; 3.04 g/l tamocholatc, Sigma, Germany; 0*006 g/1 cholate Fluka, Switzerland), porcine mucine (L9<br><br><br><br>
For co-cultivation trials, the growth of enterobacteriacea on MRS agar was inhibited by addition of polymixin (Oxoid, England),<br>
Co-cultivatiotf Experiments   between   Lactic   Acid   Bacteria  (LAB)   and pathogens<br>
Co-cultivation experiments with potential probiotic LAB and pathogenic strains were performed at 37°C in 20 ml (Falcon tubes) simulated canine small intesinal juice enriched with different carbon sources (sugar, pet food) to favor metabolic activity of the cultures. LAB were inoculated at lOE+08 cfu/ml, pathogens at lOE+02 cfu/ml, lOE+04 cfu/ml and lOE+06 cfii/ml. Samples were taken at different time points up to 8 hpurs and viable cell couiits were determined by surface plating of 10-fold dilutions on respective media.<br>
I-<br>
Co-cultivation trials were performed under different conditions including enrichment of simulated canine small intesinal juice with dextrose (5 g/1) and different concentrations of commercially available extruded dry pet food (5, 25 or 100 g/1; Friskies ALPO Complete, USA). The latter was homogenized (Stomacher Lab Blender) and suspended in electrolyte solution. All e;5)eriments Were performed in duplicate.<br>
Example 6<br>
Co-cultivation experiments between four lactobaciUi and the four potentially pathogenic strains £. coli ETEC08:H9, E. coli 0149:K88, S. typhimurium SL1344 and Sh dysenteriae were performed in simulated canine duodenal juice enriched with 5 g/1 dextrose (Difco). Lactobacilli were inoculated at lOE+08 cfu/ml and the Gram negative indicator strains at 10E+02cfu/ml. Results are compiled in Table IL<br>
Table 11 Co-cultivation between LAB and potentially pathogenic bacteria in simulated canine smaU intestinal juice enriched with dextrose<br><br><br>
All four investigated lactobaciUi demonstrated antimicrobial activity but only L acidophilus NCC2628 (CNCM 1-2453) and Lrhamnosus NCP2583 (CNCM 1-2449) demonstrated high activity against aU tested pathogens. Both, strains were not only able to inhibit the growth, but were also able to completely inactivate the pathogens contained in the test system (no remaining viable cells).<br>
Example 7<br>
Co-cultivation experiments were performed between lactobacilli [(L acidophilus NCC2628 (CNCM 1-2453), L rhamnosus NCC2583 (CNCM 1-2449) and 5. typhimurium SL1344 in simulated canine duodenal juice enriched with commercially available extmded dry pet food (5, 25 or 100 g/1; Frisfcies ALPO Complete, USA). Lactobacilli were inoculated at lOE+08 cfii/ml and the Gram negative indicator strains at lOE+02 cfu/ml. Results are compiled in Table 12,<br>
Table 12 Co-cultivation between LAB and potentially pathogenic bacteria in simulated canine small intestinal juice enriched with dry pet food<br><br><br>
Results demonstrate the high potential of especially L. acidophilus NCC2628 (CNCM 1-2453) to inhibit the growth and even to inactivate completely small intestinal pathogens under very practical conditions such as in a mix of simulated small intestinal juice and pet food* The antimicrobial activity of L. acidophilus NCC2628 was very high even at low levels of enrichment with commercial pet food serving as a source of fexmantable sugars for the organism. In contrast this observation made for L acidophilus NCC2628 the effectiveness of L. rhamnosus NCC2583 (CNCM 1-2449) was depending on the level of enrichment with pet food in that way that an incrasing antimicrobial activity was observed with increasing amounts of pet food added to the test system.<br>

The antimicrobial activity of L acidophilus NCC2628 (CNCM 1-2453) was sufficiently high to completely inactivate even high initial concentration of 5. typhimurium SL1344.<br>
Example 9: in-vivo immune stimulation in dogs<br>
The immune stimulating potential for pet-isolated strains of probiotics was tested in a clinical trial using the L acidophilus NCC 2628 strain.<br>
Methods:<br>
Canine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) proliferation upon stimulation with different mitogens:<br>
20 dogs 4 to 7 years old were subjected to this trial. The feeding protocol consisted in one week of adaptation with "Friskies Vitality" w/o chicory and 4 weeks of test with "Friskies Vitality*' w/o chicory + L, acidophilus NCC2628 bacteria.<br>
L acidophilus NCC2628 was prepared in a sufficient amount and in a stable lyophiUzed form witii regard to strain-survival in the gastro-intestinal tract of the tested animals. Bacteria were mixed with 4 g of trehalose in order to add a sufficient volume of carrier for mixing the prepared bacteria witii tiie<br><br>
food-matrix for the animals. Bacteria were prepared in individual plastic tubes (5,0E+09 cfti /day) and daily added in a part of the food to be sure that total bacteria will be eaten.<br>
Blood was collected from the dogs after the four weeks of probiotic administration. The blood was fractionated through a Vaccutainer™* colimm (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). PBMC were recovered according to the manufacturer's recommandations.<br>
Cells were stimulated with different mitogens or phorbol esters that induce a strong proliferation of T cells (concanavalin A (conA), Phytohemaglutmin (PHA)), of B cells (Pokeweed mitogen (PA2/M)), and of all cells (Phorbol-Myristate-Acetate/Ionomycine (PMA/Iono)). 10^ cells per well were incubated with mitogens or the phorbol esters (the respective doses are indicated in the figure 1) in a final volume of 200: jil of RPM[-1640 culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics in 96-well flat-bottom culture plates (Nunc)*<br>
Cells were maintained in humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C for 48h. The cells were pulse-labelled with 1 |aCi of [^H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Switzerland) for a further l'8h. The cells were then harvested on nitrocellulose filters (Packard) and bound [^HJthymidine was measured by scintillation counting (TopCoimt; Packard, Switzerland). Cell proliferation was calculated as the mean (counts per minute (c.p.m) (±SD) from triplicates.<br>
Results:<br>
Figure 1: There was a clear increase in cell proliferation in response to all mitogens in the group of dog fed with. L acidophilus NCC2628 compared with the control group. This increase was significant in cultures stimulated with the phorbol esters PMA + ionomycin. This data shows that lymphoid cells from probitic-fed dogs were more reactive upon activation in vitro and suggests that the immune system of probiotic-fed dogs has been stimulated.<br>
Example 10: in vitro modulation of immune functions by pet-isolated lactobacillus strains<br><br>
An in-vitro screening of the different pet-isolated lactobacillus strains described above was setup to determine their immune modulation potential. To this end, we measured their ability to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-12, EFNy) and/or anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-p) (Anand A.C., Adya CM. 1999, Trop. Gastroenterol; 20(3):97-106 ; Spellberg B., Edwards J,EJr 2001, Clin. Infect. Dis.\ 32(1):76-1020. This aimed at selecting potential candidate strains for strong anti-pathogenic or anti-cancer immune functions as well as antagonistic functions against canine intestinal pathologies such as allergy and inflammation (Inflammatory bowel diseases). Additional cultures were set up with medimn alone (negative control), with Enterococcus faecium straia SF68 (NCIMB 10415, Cerbios-Pharaia, Switzerland) and with a human lactobacillus isolate STU (NCC 2461, CNCM 1-2116) (positive control).<br>
Method:<br>
Cytokine profiles induced by different probiotic strains in canine leukocytes:<br>
Blood from normal adult dogs was treated 5 min at room temperature with ACK lysing buffer (150 mM of NH4CI, 1 mM of KHCO3, and 0J mM of Na2EDTA in HiO, pH = 7.4). The leukocytes were washed twice with RPMI medium (without antibiotics) and seeded at 2.10^ cell/ml into 24-well tissue culture plates, 1 ml of a bacterial suspension (described bellow) containing 10^ CFU was added to each well.<br>
For control treatment, medium alone was added to the leukocytes. The samples were incubated 18h at 3TQ and 5% COa- Subsequently, leukocytes were collected, washed in PBS and centrifuged. The cell pellet was lysed with 500 IJ1 of Trizol reagent (Gibco BRL). RNA was extracted from cellular lysates using the Nucleospin RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel). RT-PCR for canine cytokine amplifications were performed using the AB gene kit (Merck). The primer references (all produced by Microsynth) are indicated bellow. Densitometric analysis of the PCR-bands revealed in the ethidium bromide-stained agarsose gels was performed using the NIH Image software. All bands were normalised with the respective p-actiLn PCR-product band obtained with each sample (internal control), and the results are expressed as arbitrary units reflecting the pixel densities of each cytokine PCR-product band (figure 2).<br><br>
-	Preparation of the bacteria: the different strains of lactobacilli were<br>
grown in MRS medium for approximately 8h until they reached<br>
identical density. The bacteria were diluted in RPMI medium<br>
without antibiotics to final concentrations of 10^ CFU/ml-<br>
-	Primers used for cytokine -RT-PCRs:<br><br>
Figure 2: The data show that cytokine profiles induced by lactobacilli are strain-dependent For example, the strain NCC2628 induced high levels of EL-10 and TGF»p, highlighting the potential for this particular strain for the immune modulation of inflammatory disorders such as allergy and inflammatory bowel diseases. In contrast, the strain NCC2583 induced strong levels of IFNy arid IL-12, which makes this strain a good candidate for anti-pathogenic or anti-cancer activity*<br>
Example 11<br>
Three dried pet foods are used in the study. These will be referred to as "A", "B'* and "C", Pet food "A" is a nutritionally complete dried pet food, available under the brand name ALPO (ALPO is a registered trade mark of SOOETE DBS PRODUITS NESTLE SA. of Switzeriand).<br>
Pet food B is the same nutritionally complete dried pet food as Pet Food A, but is supplemented with a powdered mixture of selected probiotic micro-organisms fed from a sachet The mixture comprises substantially equal amounts of L. acidophilus NCC2628 and bifidobacterium sp. NCC2657.<br><br>
It is sprinkled over the food at each meal serving, the dosage supplied being about L0E8 cfu/day.<br>
Pet fodd^C is a nutritionally complete dried pet food which is substantially identical to Pet Food A but which contains 1-2% by weight of a dried supernatant of a culture of Enterococcus faecium SF68 (NCIMB 10415).<br>
30 dogs are used in the study. The dogs are pre-fed for 8 weeks using Pet Food A. The dogs are then divided into 3 groups of 10 dogs each, designated groups A, B and C and fed the correspondingly-named diets for 8 weeks:<br>
The dogs have free access to water and are fed once a day. The prevalence of dandruff in the coat is determined by a 30 member evaluation panel at commencement and then at 7 weeks later.<br>
The dogs are groomed prior to evaluation by the panel and the panel members do not compare notes during the evaluation.<br>
In this evaluation the dogs are presented to each of the individual panelists in 20 different painngs. The panelists are asked to indicate on a their scoresheets which dog of the pair presented displays (1) less dandruff (2) higher coat gloss and (3) less coat odour.<br>
The overall coat condition of all dogs is visually and tactilely good as can be expected of normal, healthy dogs. However, the dogs which are fed diet C are found to have noticeably less dandruff than those fed on control diet A. Those fed on diet B have noticeably glossier coat and exhibit less noticeable coat odour than those on A. These characteristics are found not to differ significantly statistically when compared with the dogs in group B.<br>
Example 12:<br>
A feed mixture is made up of about 58% by weight of com, about 6% by weight of com gluten, about 23% by weight of meat and meal, salts, vitamins and minerals making up the remainder.<br>
The feed mixture is fed into a preconditioner and moistened. To this mixture is added a powder containing a mixture of the following Lactobacillus strains: Lactobacillus rhamnosus NCC2583 (CNCM 1-2449), Lactobacillus<br><br>
acidophilus NCC2628 (CNCM 1-2453) and Enterococcus faecium SF68 (NCIMB 10415). The powder is substantially homogeneously dispersed throughout the mixture. This moistened feed mix is then fed into an extruder-cooker and gelatinised. The gelatinised matrix leaving the extruder is forced through a die and extruded. The extrudate is cut into pieces suitable for feeding to dogs, dried at about 110°C for about 20 minutes, and cooled to form pellets. The extrudate pieces are checked for bacterial activity of the added strains. None is detected.<br>
Example 13<br>
24 dogs are used in this study. They include younger ^d older dogs, the latter being from 8 to 12 years in age. The older dogs selected, exhibit external signs of joint inflammation commensurate with tiieir ages and appear to experience some difficulty in moving at times. Certain movements appear to be painful. These symptoms are often observed in older dogs and are believed to relate to arthritic condition.<br>
Three dried pet foods are used in the study, designated A, B and C. Pet food A is a nutritionally complete dried pet food (ALPO Beefy Diimer). This is the control food.<br>
All 24 members of the selected are pre-fed for 8 weeks using Pet Food A. The dogs are then divided into 3 groups. A, B and C each having 8 dogs and the same proportion of younger and older within. Each group is then fed the following respective diets for 8 weeks:<br><br>
Pet food B is a nutritionally complete dried pet food which is substantially identical to Pet Food A but which contains has a coating making up 2% of its weight, tiie coating comprising the micro-organisms of Enterococcus faecium SF68 (NCIMB 10415). The quantity of food fed daily to each dog is calculated according to individual body mass, so that the dosage of L0E-fO9cfu/day.<br><br>
Diet C comprises the extruded kibbles produced in example 12 above. The quantity of food fed daily to each dog is calculated accordixig to individual body mass, so that the micro-organism dosage is 1.0E4-llcfu/day.<br>
The dogsrhave free access to water and arc fed once a day. An activity meter is attached to the collar of each dog and measurements are taken daily. The dogs are also visually evaluated for activity by kennel staff.<br>
The condition of all dogs is visually and tactilely good as can be expected of normal, healthy dogs. However, the dogs in die groups that receive pet food diets B and C are noticeably more active than their counterparts on diet A, Meter readings support these observations.<br>
Further, the elderly dogs in groups B and C, after being fed diets B and C for the trial period, appear to exhibit fewer external sigi^g of local joiat inflammation. Further, the dogs appear to experience lower levels of pain on physical movement and move more freely than before. It can be concluded that diets B and C appear to provide relief with respect to certain sign$ of ageing and improve the motility of older pets.<br>
Example 14: Dry cat food<br>
A feed mixture is made up of about 58% by weight of com, about 6% by weight of com gluten, about 23% by weight of chicken meal, salts, vitamins and minerals makmg up the remainder.<br>
The feed mixture is fed into a prcconditioner and moistened* The moistened feed is then fed into an extruder-cooker and gelatinised. The gelatinised matrix leaving the extruder is forced thiough a die and extnided. The extrudate is cut into pieces suitable for feeding to cats, dried at about UO°C for about 20 minutes, and cooled to form pellets. At this point, a lyophilized powder of one or more strains of the followmg Lactobacillus species is provided for appUcation to the pellets: Lactobacillus rhamnosus NCC2583 (CNCM 1-2449), Lactobacillus acidophilus NCC2628 (CNCM I-2453) or Enterococcus faecium SF68 (NCIMB 10415). Sufficient powder is thus provided so that the corresponding dietaiy intake amoimt for the cat is from about l,0E+07-1.0E+9 cfu / day. Some of die powder is mixed into a first mass of pellets and bagged. A second quantity of die powder is measured out and mixed with a hpid carrier which is dien sprayed on to a second mass of pellets. The pellets are bagged after tlie coating has dried sufficiently at 50-60°C for some minutes<br><br>
Example 15: Canned pet fpod and supplement.<br>
A mixture is prepared from 73 % of poultry carcass, pig lungs and beef liver (ground)/r6 % of wheat flour, 2 % of dyes, vitamins, and inorganic salts. This mixture is emulsified at 12°C a-nd extruded in the form of a pudding which is then cooked at a temperature of 90°C. It is cooled to 30°C and cut in chunks. 45% of these chunks are mixed with 55% of a sauce prepared from 98% of water, 1% of dye and 1% of guar gum. Tinplate cans are filled and sterilized at 125*'C for 40 min. As a probiotic supplement to be mixed with the pet-food before serving, additional packaging in sachet form with strains of the following Lactobacillus species are provided Lactobacillus rhamnosus NCC2583 (CNCM 1-2449), Lactobacillus acidophilus NCC^28 (CNCM I-2453) or Enterococcus faecium SF68 (NCIMB 10415). The corresponding amount for the pet is from about 106-1012 cfu/day, depending on whether a cat or a dog and on physical factors such as body mass. This is supplied as a supplement with removably attached to the can, together with feeding directions*<br><br><br><br><br><br>
