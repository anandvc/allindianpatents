.the present invention relates to a process for preparing (2-hydroxyphenyl) triazine-<br>
This invention pertains to novel methods for the preparation of tris-aryl-o-hydroxy-<br>
phenyl-s-triazines using cyanuric chloride as a starting material. Particular o-hydroxyphenyl-<br>
s-triazines which can be made by these new methods are: bis-aryl-resorcinol based s-<br>
triazines; mono-aryl-bis-resorcinol based s-triazines; and tries-resorcinol-s-triazines.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Tris-aryl-o-hydroxyphenyl-s-triazines are intermediates for or are themselves UV absorbers useful for the protection of natural or synthetic materials from the adverse action of actinic radiation. There are many methods described for the preparation of such s-triazines as seen from the publications of S. Tanimoto and M. Yamagata, Senryo to Yakuhim, 1995. 40(12), 325-339 and of H. Brunetti and G. E. Luethi, Helv. Chim. Acta, 1972. 55(5), 1566-1595.<br>
The most versatile method is to employ one or more Friedel-Crafts reactions starting from cyanuric chloride. A major obstacle in this approach is the fact that Friedel-Crafts reactions of aryl groups and cyanuric chloride are non-selective. This is a problem when the goal is to prepare an asymmetric tris-aryl-s-triazine. This is explained in the Tanimoto and Brunetti publications mentioned above and in United States Patent Nos. 5,084,570 and 5,106,972. However, it is well-known that substitution reactions between nucleophiles and cyanuric chloride are selective as taught by E. M. Smolin and L. Rapport, s-Triazines and Derivatives in The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds, A. Weisberg Ed., Interscience Publishers, New York, 1959. pp. 53-57.<br>
One possible approach to prepare asymmetric tris-aryl-s-triazines selectively would be to (a) replace one or two chlorine atoms of cyanuric chloride with an appropriate protecting group in a nucleophilic manner; (b) replace the remaining chlorine atom(s) with the desired aryl group via a Friedel-Crafts reaction; (c) displace the protecting group(s) with chlorine, and finally (d) replace the newly formed chlorine(s) with the second aryl group in a Friedel-Crafts manner. United States Patent Nos. 5,084,570 and 5,106,972 disclose this strategy for the preparation of 2,(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-diaryl-s-triazine. The protecting group chosen in<br><br>
these two patents is methyl merchantman. The process outlined is four steps starting from cyanuric chloride.<br>
Another drawback of Friedel-Crafts reactions of aryl groups and cyanuric chloride in addition of non-selectivity is the fact that large amounts of Lewis acid are necessary to mediate the reaction, normally equimolar amounts. The Lewis acid most commonly used is aluminum chloride. These reactions produce prodigious amounts of aluminum waste which is environmentally hard to handle.<br>
Japanese Hei 9-59263 discloses a three-step synthetic approach for the preparation of asymmetric tris-aryl-hydroxyphenyl-s-triazines. The preferred method of the Japanese reference is a one-pot process using a Lewis acid to mediate all three steps. This reference will be discussed in’ more detail later in this application.<br>
A welcome addition to the art therefore would be to (a) provide a method of performing Friedel-Crafts reactions between aryl groups and s-triazines using protic acids instead of Lewis acids, and to (b) provide a method of preparing asymmetric tris-aryl-s-triazines in less than four synthetic steps.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
One object of the invention is a process in which protic acids may be employed as Friedel-Crafts catalysts for the reaction between aryl groups and s-triazines.<br>
Another object of the invention is a method for the preparation of asymmetric tris-aryl-s-triazines in less than four synthetic steps.<br>
A third object of the invention is a process combining the two processes mentioned above.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Strong protic acids, such as hydrogen halides, sulfuric or sulfonic acids, nitric acid etc. as well as solid-supported protic acids such as AMBERLYST® (Rohm &amp; Haas), AMBERLITE® (Rohm &amp; Haas) and NAFION® (duPont) catalysts, may be employed as effective Friedel-<br><br>
Crafts catalysts to form carbon-carbon bonds between aryl groups and s-triazines. Preferred are acids having a pKa value below 4, especially below 2; examples include the substances listed above or hydrogen chloride (gaseous or as solution), methanesulfonic acid, p-toluene-sulfonic acid. Active leaving groups are halogen, especially CI or F, or alkoxy and aryloxy. Preferred leaving groups are chlorine, phenoxy and substituted phenoxy moieties.<br>
The simpliest example of a reaction of this type is replacing the chlorine atoms on cyanuric chloride with resorcinol to prepare a tris-2,4,6-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-s-trJazine. United States Patent Nos. 3,118,887 and 3.244.708 describe such syntheses, but where large amounts of aluminum chloride are used. Indeed, no added catalyst at all is required as the hydrogen chloride gas released during the initial nucleophilic reaction between resorcinol and cyanuric chloride serves as the catalyst for the carbon-carbon bond formation as seen below:<br><br>
X in these formulae is hydrogen, alkyl, phenylalkyi or halogen.<br>
This reaction may be performed in a solvent or it may be done in neat molten resorcinol. A wide variety of solvents may be used, for example, non-polar hydrocarbons such as xylene or polar solvents such as tetramethylene sulfone. The reaction will work over<br><br><br><br>
Ri, R2 and R3 are each independently hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 12 carbon atoms, hydroxy, alkoxy of 1 to 12 carbon atoms, halogen, phenyl or phenyl substituted by alkyl of 1 to 12 carbon atoms, hydroxy, alkoxy of 1 to 12 carbon atoms or halogen. The solvents and temperature ranges are those given supra. 0-Attached resorcinol groups on the s-triazine ring are observed as transient intermediates during the course of these reactions.<br>
Similar Friedel-Crafts reactions may also be employed with alkoxy or aryloxy moieties as the leaving group. In these cases an external protic acid is added to the mixture. The most effective protic acids are hydrogen chloride gas and methanesulfonic acid. As with halogen, one or more alkoxy or aryloxy groups may be replaced in this fashion. Phenoxy and/or substituted phenoxy groups are especially suitable leaving groups as seen in the reactions outlined below.<br><br><br><br>
R1, R2 and Rg-are as defined above. The solvents and tennperature ranges used are as above using clilorine as the leaving group.<br>
The instant process also pertains to the preparation of asymmetric tris-aryl-s-triazines in only three steps while avoiding the selectivity problem of Friedel-Crafts reactions with cyanuric chloride. United States Patent Nos. 5,084,570 and 5,106,972 describe a four-step process to overcome this selectivity problem. The key to the new three step process is to take advantage of a nucleophilic substitution step on cyanuric chloride which is selective (E. M. Smolin et al., loc cit). The nucleophile introduced into the triazine ring will also perform as a leaving group under Friedel-Crafts conditions. It is a poor leaving group compared to chlorine. In this way selectivity under Friedel-Crafts condition is achieved. This allows one to avoid having to rechlorinate the triazine ring prior to subsequent Friedel-Crafts reactions thus reducing the number of synthetic steps. Effective nucleophiles which also serve as Friedel-Crafts leaving groups are alkoxy and aryloxy groups. Especially effective are phenoxy and substituted phenoxy.<br>
For example, in order to prepare a mono-resorcinol-bis-aryl-s-triazine, cyanuric chloride is reacted with one mole of phenol or substituted phenol under nucleophilic (basic) conditions.<br><br><br>
R1, R2 and R3 are defined as above.<br>
As mentioned-above, the phenoxy group is an active Friedei-Crafts leaving group, it is a weaker one than chlorine thus allowing for the introduction of a relatively weak Friedel-Crafts substrate such as m-xylene, toluene, benzene, chlorobenzene or biphenyl while leaving the phenol group intact.<br><br>
In the third step, the phenoxide may be replaced with a strong Friedel-Crafts substrate such as resorcinol.<br><br>
r <br>
X, Ri, R2 and R3 are as defined above.<br>
Japanese Hei 9-59263 discloses this three-step synthetic approach for the preparation<br>
of asymmetric tris-aryl-hydroxyphenyl-s-triazines. The preferred method of the Japanese<br>
reference is a one-pot process using a Lewis acid to mediate all three steps. The Japanese<br>
reference does not describe that step 3 can be mediated successfully by protic acids and<br>
that resorcinol itself may be used as a blocking group as is discussed further infra. This<br>
reference does not suggest the general applicability of the three-step synthesis. For<br>
example, the Japanese reference does not disclose that, if a Lewis acid is used for step 3,<br>
levels below 0.5 mol percent may be effective depending on reaction conditions. In reality,<br>
	levels below 0.5 mol percent may be used to afford good yields of desired s-triazines.<br>
Likewise, asymmetric tris-aryl-s-triazines which contain one weak and two strong Friedel-Crafts substrates may be prepared in three steps from cyanuric chloride. Examples are bis-resorcinol-mono-aryl-s-triazines where the aryl group is m-xylene, toluene, benzene, chlorobenzene or biphenyl. These materials are prepared by reacting cyanuric chloride with two moles of a phenol or substituted phenol under basic conditions to form a mono-chloro-bis-phenoxy-s-triazine. The remaining chlorine atom may be replaced with a weak Friedel-Crafts substrate such as m-xylene, toluene, benzene, chlorobenzene or biphenyl leaving the phenoxy groups intact. The phenoxy groups may then be replaced by a strong Friedel-Crafts substrate such as resorcinol.<br><br><br><br>
A special embodiment of this approacli to prepare mono-resorcinol-bis-aryl-s-triazine would be to use resorcinol itself as the blocking phenol in step 1. A bis-triazine-resorcinol adduct is formed and is carried through steps 2 and 3 as seen above. This method is especially advantageous if excess resorcinol is used. In an industrial process only one phenol (namely resorcinol) would need to be recovered and recycled instead of two thus allowing for substantial cost savings. This embodiment is outlined below.<br><br><br>
The nucleophilic first step in the special embodiment above may be performed in a variety of solvents such as acetone, acetone/water mixtures and xylene. It may also be carried out by means of a two-phase reaction with water and a hydrocarbon solvent such as xylene. A phase-transfer catalyst including quaternary ammonium salts or polyether such as glymes or poly(ethylene glycol) aids the reaction. Bases which can be used include hydroxide, carbonate and bicarbonate salts of sodium, potassium and calcium. Effective temperatures range from -20°C to 100°C. The most effective temperatures range from -20°C to 50°C.<br>
Especially effective condition are the use of 10 % water in acetone as solvent and sodium hydroxide as the base at a temperature range of -20°C to 5°C. Also especially effective is the use of a two-phase system of water/xylene with sodium bicarbonate as the base and a quaternary ammonium salt such as benzyltrimethylammonium chloride as phase-transfer catalyst at temperatures of -5°C to 10°C. Also especially effective is the use of benzyltrimethylammonium chloride as a catalyst in xylene at temperatures of -10°C to 10°C with potassium carbonate base under anhydrous conditions.<br>
The second step in which chlorine is displaced by the weaker Friedel-Crafts substrate requires a Lewis acid catalyst. Aluminum chloride is the Lewis acid of choice and may be used in the range of 0.2 to 1.5 equivalents per equivalent of s-triazine. The reaction may be performed in a solvent such as chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene or nitrobenzene, but is best performed neat using an excess of the Friedel-Crafts substrate as solvent. Effective amounts of neat Friedel-Crafts reactant range from 2 to 20 molar equivalents. Examples of solvents which may be employed in this way include m-xylene, toluene, benzene, chlorobenzene and biphenyi. An effective temperature range for this reaction is from 0°C to 170°C; especially from 70°C to 150°C.<br>
It is especially effective to perform the first step in a hydrocarbon solvent which will also be the Friedel-Crafts reactant for step two. Step two may then be performed without isolation of the product of step one.<br>
Lewis acids usable within present process are mainly those known in the art as Friedel-Crafts catalysts; examples are AICI3, FeCIa, ZnCIa, TiCU, SnClj; especially preferred is AICI3.<br><br>
step three, in which the phenol is replaced by a strong Friedel-Crafts substrate such as resorcinol, nnay be performed with a protic acid or a Lewis acid catalyst or a combination of both protic acid and Lewis acid catalysts. The preferred protic acids are hydrogen chloride gas and methanesulfonic acid. A solvent may be used or the reaction may be performed in the neat molten resorcinol. Solvent choice may range from polar solvents such as tetra-methylene sulfone to non-polar hydrocarbons such as m-xylene. Very often a single solvent may be used for ail three steps. The amount of resorcinol may range from 1.2 to 10 molar equivalents per phenoxy group being displaced. The most effective range is from 1.2 to 4 molar equivalents of resorcinol per phenoxy moiety. The reaction may be performed e.g. with a catalyst level of 0.33 to 1.5 molar equivalents per triazine. The temperature for the reaction may range from 25°C to 200°C. The most effective temperature range is from 120°C to170°C.<br>
