This invention relates to a modular suction system for carding machines and is intended to control and regulate the suction pressure at different stations of textile carding machine and has been designed with the objective of achieving better waste removal during textile processing.<br>
Quality of sliver produced by carding machines depends on the percentage of waste removed therefirom at various stages of carding. Raw material fed to a carding machine consists of considerable waste such as nep, trash, microdust seed particles and the like. The quality of the yam finally produced in a textile depends on the carding process where major portion of waste removal takes place. Removal of waste from the yam at further processing stations is very difficult Suction or the pressure in the ducts, through which the medium of material passes during its passage is an important factor in waste removal and quality of the final product.<br>
Conventional carding machines are provided with filter hoses at different locations which transfer waste material into a filter. The diameter and the location of the hose in the collection chambers are critical factors in deciding the suction pressure of the material transported.<br>
The modular system aims at regulating and controlling the suction by providing a plurality of ducts connected through distribution ducts through transfer ducts to its junction boxes and then to a filter.<br><br>
Distribution ducts have openings located at all stations from which loose fibres come out. Plurality of these ducts are connected to transfer ducts provided on either side of the machine. The modular system according to this invention has at least four distribution ducts, two of which are positioned in the front and use other two at the back of the machine. These ducts have multiple openings for connection with the desired machine ducts. The distance between these openings is equal to the distance between the locations of the ducts or the machine. Transfer ducts on either side of the carding machine are connected to a conventional filter box through junction boxes located in a middle cannal.<br>
Distribution duct on the left side has openings located at brush roller duct, in between cylinder and doffer suction duct, cleaner duct, flat return zone duct, web doffing suction on the front of the carding machine.<br>
Right side front distribution ducts open to brush roller duct, in between cylinder and doffer suction duct, flats return zone duct and coiler suction duct of the carding machine.<br>
The right side back distribution ducts connect the flat stripper duct and the feed roller duct at the right side of the machine. The left side front duct and left side back duct are interconnected by means of left top transfer cannals while the right side front duct and the right side back duct are connected by a right side top transfer canal. These two canals are linked by a middle canal<br><br>
which houses junction boxes. This middle canal is a rectangular box opened at the two sides thereof for connecting with middle left junction box. A main junction box transfers the material collected from the left and right side of the machine to a filter.<br>
The modular suction system for carding machines according to this invention comprises a left side front distribution duct, a left side back distribution duct a right side front distribution duct and a right side back distribution duct, each of said ducts having plurality of openings alignable with waste removal stations of a carding machine, a first transfer channel connecting said left side front and back distribution ducts, a second transfer channel connecting the right side front and back distribution ducts said first and second transfer channels being connected to a filter box through a middle canal provided with at least one junction box.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the single figure in the drawings accompanying the provisional specification.<br>
The four distribution ducts are represented by reference letters LSBF, LSBB, RSBF and RSBB. The two transfer ducts are shown as left side front top, left side back top, right side back top, right side back top by reference letters LSFT, LSBT, RSBT and RSBT. The dimensions of the<br><br>
ducts range from 00 to 90 mm internally and 110 to 130 outwardly. The materials collected in the distribution ducts are transferred to a common junction box which is located on the left side of the machine. A further junction box represented by MLJ is provided on the right side of the machine and is connected to the main junction box J through a middle central canal MCC.<br>
This system can be aligned to the existing carding machine as the size and the shape of the ducts are designed accordingly. Waste materials collected at various stations of processing are transferred more effectively to the filter box. Incorporation of the modular system enhances the quality of yam produced. All the components of the system are sealed in an airtight manner.<br>
View glasses may be provided to monitor the material flow through the system. Components or parts of the system may be made cold rolled sheets, stainless steel or aluminium. The inside of the ducts may have smooth surface finish to provide good flow there through.<br>
Though this invention is described and illustrated hereinabove with reference to a specific embodiment, alterations and modifications known to persons skilled in the art are within its scope and that of the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A modular suction system for carding machines comprising a left side front distribution duct, a left side back distribution duct, a right side front distribution duct and a right side back distribution duct, each of said ducts having a plurality of openings alignable with waste removal stations of a carding machine, a first transfer channel connecting said left side front and back distribution ducts, a second transfer channel connecting the right side front and back distribution ducts, said first and second transfer channels being connected to a filter box through a middle canal provided with atleast one junction box.<br>
2.	The modular system as claimed in claim 1, wherein said left side front distribution duct has five openings corresponding to brush roller duct, in beteween cylinder and doffer sunction duct, cleaner duct, flats return zone duct, web doffing suction duct.<br>
3.	The modular system as claimed in claims 1 and 2, wherein said left side back distribution duct has four  openings corresponding to flats stripping duct, cleaner top duct, cleaner bottom duct and feed roller duct.<br><br>
4.	The modular system as claimed in claims 1 to 3, wherein said right side front distribution duct has four openings corresponding to the brush roller duct, in between cylinder and doffer suction duct, flats return zone duct and coiler suction duct of the carding machine.<br>
5.	The modular system as claimed in claims 1 to 4, wherein said right side back distribution duct has two openings corresponding to flats stripping duct and feeder roller duct of said carding machine.<br>
6.	The modular system as claimed in claims 1 to 5, wherein a junction box is provided on the right side of said middle canal which connects the transfer channels.<br>
7. The modular system as claimed in claims 1 to 6, wherein the inner surfaces of the ducts and channels are provided with smooth surface finish.<br>
8.       The modular system as claimed in claims 1 to 7 wherein said ducts and channels are made of steel or aluminium and are leak proof<br><br>
9.      A modular suction system for carding machines substantially as herein described.<br>
