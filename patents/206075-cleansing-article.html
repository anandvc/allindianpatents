COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10; rule 13)<br>
1.	Title of the invention. -      CLEANSING ARTICLE<br>
2.	Applicant(s)<br><br>
(a)	NAME : HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED<br>
(b)	NATIONALITY : a company incorporated under the Indian<br>
Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at<br>
(c)	ADDRESS : Hindustan Lever House, 165/166,<br>

3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br>
 WO 03/022230	PCT/EP02/09826<br>
COSMETIC EFFERVESCENT  CLEANSING PILLOW<br>
The invention concerns a cleansing article based upon a water-insoluble sachet with an effervescent foamable powder actuatable with water held within the sachet.<br>
Cleansing products have traditionally been marketed in the form of bar soaps, shower gels and mousses, the lather being generated by mechanical and aerosol dispensers.  Mechanical implements have been used by consumers to assist in lather formation and physical removal of dirt through scrubbing. Wash cloths have been the implement of choice throughout recent history.<br>
New formats for cleansing hold great consumer appeal.  For instance, surfactant and conditioner compositions have been layered into apertured wipes such as disclosed in U.S. Patent 6,280,757 Bl (McAtee et al.) .  Open-mesh sponges such as described in U.S. Patent 6,066,607 (Gordon et al.) have assisted in generating foam from shower gels thereby improving speed and quality of lathering.<br>
* ■•<br>
U.S. Patent 5,980,931 (Fowler et al.) describes a<br>
substantially dry, disposable personal care article wherein a surfactant system is dried onto a water-insoluble non-woven or similar substrate.  A second generation of dual layered towelette has been reported.  See WO 00/42S61 (Smith), WO 01/08542 (Cen et al.), WO 01/08640 (Smith et al.), WO 01/08641 (Lorenzi et al.), WO 01/08655 (Phipps et al. ) , WO 01/03656 (Loren::i et al. ) , WO 01/08657 (Lorenzi et al.) and WO 01/08658 (Cawkwell et al.) all describing disposable personal cleansing towelettes with lathering surfactant on at least a two layer cloth with one   layer<br><br>
_ WO 03/022230	PCT/EP02/09826<br>
being a high loft substrate.  Consumers are expected to	<br>
place the towelette under water to generate a surfactant lather.<br>
Another approach is described in U.S. Patent 6,063,390 (Farrell et al.) which discloses wiping articles that include an effervescent, preferably powdered, cleanser composition held within a pouch of a sachet.  Water contact causes the composition to effervesce.  Several problems exist with the aforedescribed "pillow" system.<br>
Among those problems are maintenance of the powdered composition within the pouch (avoidance of seepage).  Loss of powder is a particular problem where pouch walls are constructed of a high loft substrate.  Other challenges involve control of gas generation to maintain a constant billowed pouch profile.  Also it has been found difficult to heat-seal together substrates formed of different construction and types of materials.<br>
Accordingly, it is an advantage of the present invention to be able to provide an effervescent powdered composition containing sachet having an improved effectiveness at retaining powdered particles within a pouch of the sachet.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is to be able to provide an effervescent composition containing sachet wherein walls of the sachet allow for a controlled billowing of lather.<br>
According to a first aspect there is provided an article for cleansing body surfaces, the article including:<br><br>
WO 03/022230	                                                                                PCT/EP02/09826<br>
an effervescent cleansing composition capable of generating a foam upon contact with water; and<br>
a pouch formed of first and second water-insoluble substrates, at least one being water permeable, the first and second substrates forming therebetween an area housing the cleansing composition, the first substrate comprising a spun lace or a carded/chemically bonded non-woven material, the second substrate comprising a high loft sheet bonded to a non-woven sheet selected from the group consisting of meltblown, spunbond and sheet combinations thereof.<br>
In a further embodiment, a high loft water insoluble sheet forms at least part of the second substrate with a high loft surface on an outward side of the second substrate. Yet, in a still further embodiment, the first substrate may be of a different construction than that of the second. More particularly, the first substrate may be a spun lace (hydroentangled) non-woven fabric or a carded/chemically bonded non-woven.<br>
Advantages of the meltblown, spunbond and/or combination second substrate is that this material is less adversely affected in its sealability when contaminent effervescent particles of the composition accidentally enter machinery during the pouch manufacture process. Moreover, meltblown and spunbond non-wovens allow for better sealability when sandwiched between the first substrate and any high loft sheet forming part of the second substrate. The high loft sheet imparts to the second substrate increased aeration and improved latherability properties. In pouches where a high loft side is preferred, it is necessary to deploy the meltblown and/or spunbond substrate for the additional<br><br>
 WO 03/022230	PCT/EP02/09826<br>
purpose of preventing.powder from easily shaking free through the high loft sheet and exiting the pouch.<br>
Further features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from consideration of the following drawing in which:<br>
Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a pouch according to the present invention; and<br>
Fig. 2 is a cross-sectional view taken along line 2-2 of Fig. 1.<br>
Now it has been found that foam generating pouches based on effervescent water-activatable powders are best constructed with at least one wall being a sheet of a meltblown, spunbond and/or layered combination thereof substrate.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates pouch 2 of the present invention.  The pouch has walls formed by a first spun lace substrate 4 and a second meltblown composite substrate 6, the latter being bonded to a high loft sheet 8.  Chamber 10 formed between the first and second substrates 4, 6 serves to confine a powdered effervescent composition 12.  Sheets 4 and 6  are ultrasonically sealed along a circumferential track 14 to insure no loss of the powdered composition.<br>
Copious foam is generated when pouch 2 is wetted with water, much in the same manner as a toilet bar is lathered. Physically, the pouch is constructed in an oval shape with a size fittable within a human hand thereby simulating a toilet bar.  Cross-sectional diameters may range from about 2 to about 15 cm, preferably from about 5 to about 10 cm.<br><br>
WO 03/022230	PCT/EP02/09826<br>
Sheet 6 may be -a- single meItblown layer but preferably it is a combination of several layers.  One embodiment utilizes the three layers of spunbond/meltblown/spunbond (SMS) and another utilises four layers representing<br>
spunbond/meltblown/meltblown/spunbond (SMMS) construction. In these systems the meltblown fibers are very compact and act as a barrier against loss of powder.  The spunbond layers are provided for strength and softness.<br>
The meltblown web can be any meltblown web made from a thermoplastic polymer having a melting point greater than about 50°C.  A preferred polymer is polypropylene, which is the most commonly used polymer for making meltblown webs. Other suitable polymers include poly(butylene terephthalate), polycaprolactam, poly(ethylene terephthalate) and polyethylene.<br>
The process for making meltblown webs is well known in the art and is used extensively for manufacturing a wide variety of commercial nonwoven products.  Representative examples of the meltblowing process are described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,978,185 to Buntin et al. dated August 31, 1916;  U.S. Patent No. 4,2 98,649 to Meitner dated November 3, 1931; and U.S. Patent No. 4,100,324 to Anderson et al. dated July 11, 1978, all herein incorporated by reference.  It will be appreciated, however, that other meltblowing processes will produce webs suitable for purposes of this invention.  The meltblown web can be combined or laminated to other supporting webs, such as spunbonded webs, in order :o impart strength or other attributes to the product.<br><br>
WO 03/022230	PCT/EP02/09826<br>
The basis weight for a single sheet of the meltblown base webs of this invention can range from about 2 0 to about 3 00 grams per square meter.  Preferably the basis weight will be from about 8 0 to about 250, and most preferably from about 100 to about 200 grams per square meter.<br>
Spunbonding entails extruding a multiplicity of continuous thermoplastic polymer strands through a multiplicity of die orifices in a downward direction onto a moving surface where the extruded strands are collected in randomly distributed fashion.  The randomly deposited strands are then bonded together in a heated nip to provide sufficient integrity to the resulting nonwoven web of continuous fibers.  Spunbonded webs are characterized by a high strength/weight ratio, isotropic strength, high porosity, and good abrasion resistance.<br>
Meltblowing differs from spunbonding in that the extruded polymer strands are broken up and dispersed into individual fibers by a forced air stream before being deposited onto the collecting, surface... In addition., the,, fibers, are., substantially cooled by the air so that they do not significantly crystallize and/or bond together.  Eonding of the web to retain integrity and strength occurs as a separate downstream operation.<br>
A most preferred material for the second substrate is a non-woven meltblown/spuxibond substrate available from the Polyprop Corporation.<br>
The first substrate preferably is either a spun lace or a carded/chemically bonded non-woven water-insoluble material.<br><br>
WO 03/022230	PCT/EP02/09826<br>
Particularly preferred is a cloth NC008 (Image Spun Lace) available from the PGI Corporation.-<br>
When present, the high loft sheet is generally fluid-permeable.  As used herein, "high loft"  means that the<br>
sheet has a density of from about 0.00005 g/cm to about 0.1<br>
g/cm , preferably from about 0.001 g/cm to about 0.09 g/cm and a thickness cf from about 0.1 cm to about 5 cm.<br>
As used herein, "nonwoven" means that the layer does not comprise fibers which are woven into a fabric but the layer need not comprise fibers at all, e.g., formed films, sponges, foams, scrims, etc.  When the layer comprises fiber, the fibers can either be random (i.e. randomly aligned) or they can be carded (i.e. combed to be oriented in primarily one direction).<br>
For purposes of this invention, the most preferred high loft material is a needle punched composite sold by Union Wadding Corporation.<br>

A second component of compositions within the pouch is that of an alkaline material.  The alkaline material is a substance which can generate a gas such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen or oxygen,: i.e. effervesce, when, contacted with, water and the acidic material.  Suitable alkaline materials are anhydrous salts of carbonates and bicarbonates, alkaline peroxides (e.g. sodium perborate and sodium percarbonate) and azides (e.g. sodium azide).  Preferably the alkaline material is sodium or potassium bicarbonate.

guar gums such as Jaguar C13S  which is guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride and Polyquaternium 7 commercially available as Merguat 2200.  Amounts of the deposition aid may range from about 0.01 to about 1%, preferably from about 0.05 to about 0.5%, optimally from about 0.1 to about 0.3% by weight.<br>
Advantageously an emotive agent such as a fragrance and/or botanical extract are included with the effervescent, cleansing composition.  Fragrances and botanicals are often liquids.  For this reason it may be necessary to uniformly distribute and allow absorption of liquid components into the solid powder.  One method of best achieving this is to spray these liquids onto the solids.  Amounts of the fragrance and/or botanicals combined may be at levels from about 0.1 to about 3%, preferably from 0.5 to 2%, optimally from 0.8 to 1.5% by weight of the total composition.<br>
The term "fragrance" is defined as a mixture af.. odoriferous components, optionally mixed with a suitable solvent diluent or carrier, which is employed to impart a desired odor. Particular preferred odoriferous components are cyclic and acyclic terpenes and terpenoids.  These materials are based upon isoprene repeating units.  Examples include alpha and beta pinene, myrcene, geranyl alcohol and acetate, camphene, dl-limonene, alpha and beta phellandrene, tricyclene, terpinolene, allocimmane, geraniol, nerol, linanooi, dihydrolinanool, citral, ionone, methyl ionone, citronellol, citronellal, alpha terpineol, beta terpineol, alpha fenchol, borneol, isoborneol, camphor, terpinen-1-ol, terpin-4-ol,<br><br>

dihydroterpineol, methyl chavicol, anethole, 1,4 and 1,8 cineole, geranyl nitrile, isobornyl acetate, linalyl acetate, caryophyllene, alpha cedrene, guaiol, patchouli alcohol, alpha and beta santalol and mixtures thereof. Botanicals of particular use in the present invention include yarrow, chamomile, jasmine, lavender, horse chestnut, sage, thyme, yucca, coltsfoot and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preservatives can desirably be incorporated into the cosmetic compositions of this invention to protect against the growth of potentially harmful microorganisms.  Suitable traditional preservatives for compositions of this invention are aikyl esters of para-hydroxybenzoic acids.  Other preservatives which have more recently come into use include hydantoin derivatives, propionate salts, and a variety of quaternary ammonium compounds.  Cosmetic chemists are familiar with appropriate preservatives and routinely choose them to satisfy the preservative challenge test and to provide product stability.  Particularly preferred preservatives are "pliSnoxyethanol, methyl paraben, propyl paraben, imidazolidinyl urea, sodium dehydroacetate and benzyl alcohol.  Preservatives are preferably employed in amounts ranging from 0.01% to 2% by weight of the composition.<br>
Colorants may also be included in compositions of the present invention. These substances may range from about 0.05 to about 5%, preferably between 0.1 and 3% by weight.<br><br>

It is important that the substrate sheets are not readily torn open through consumer rubbing -of the article.  Unlike laundry sachet articles, pouches of the present invention should not rupture to allow dispersion of their granular contents into wash water.  Rather it is intended for all composition components to exit by dissolution through the permeable walls of the pouch.<br>
Skin surfaces against which articles of the present invention are useful include face, body, scalp, axilla and even legs/feet.  When the article is a foot cleanser, it would be advantageous for the pouch on one of its sides to be coarse while the second of the substrates may be soft and gentle.<br>
Articles according to the present invention may be formed in the following manner.  Constituents of the effervescent cleansing composition are placed into a dry mill or similar apparatus and blended until a uniformally distributed powder results.  Thereafter, fragrance/botanical component as a Phase B is sprayed into the dry mill with concurrent agitation of the powdered composition.<br>
Rolls of first and second substrate sheets are unwound from different sides of a charging position.  The effervescent cleansing composition is placed into a hopper positioned over the charging position and between the substrate sheets. A discrete charge of powdered comoosition is released directed between the sheets and caught in a partially formed pillow.  At this point all edges defining the pouch are sealed in register trapping the effervescent cleansing<br><br>

composition within.  Cutters then separate one sealed section from another thereby forming the article.  One or more of the articles are then packaged within a moisture impermeable outer package such as a laminated foil bag to prevent activation of the effervescent system during storage.<br>
Ultrasonic welding may be employed as an alternative to heat-sealing of the first and second substrates together. Thread stitching, glue application or other closure mechanisms may also be utilized.<br>
Except in the operating and comparative examples, or where otherwise explicitly indicated, all numbers in this description indicating amounts of material are to be understood as modified by the word "about".<br>
The term "comprising" is meant not to be limiting to any subsequently stated elements but rather to encompass non-specified elements of major or minor functional importance. In other words the listed steps, elements or'options*need-not be exhaustive.<br>
The following examples will more fully illustrate embodiments of this invention. All parts, percentages and proportions referred to herein and in the appended claims are by weight unless otherwise indicated.<br><br>
WO 03/022230	PCT/EP02/09826<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
An effervescent cleansing composition was prepared according to the formulation reported in Table I.  Phase A was dry-blended in a high speed shearing mixer.  Fragrance was then sprayed onto the resultant powder as a Phase B.  Three grams of the resultant powder are then placed into a pocket of a 5 cm by 8 cm pouch.  Walls of the pouch are formed by heat sealing the circumferences of a non-woven spun lace web to a non-woven SMMS web.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Another effervescent cleansing composition was prepared according to the formulation reported in Table II. The composition is then sealed into a pouch as described in Example 1.<br><br>
WO 3/022230	PCT/EP02/09826<br><br>
