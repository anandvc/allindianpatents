Field of the Invention<br>
AZACYCLIC-COMPOUNDS FOR USE, IN THE TREATMENT OP SEROTONIN RELATED Dlb'KAbES<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds tnat arteci monoamine receptors, including serotonin receptors. The invention specifically provides compounds that are active as inverse agonists, and therefore also as antagonists, at the 5-HT2A subtype of human serotonin receptors. The invention also provides methods, utilizing the compounds of the invention for modulating 5-HT2A receptor-mediated events, that are useful for treating or alleviating disease conditions in which modification of the activity of these receptors is beneficial.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) plays a significant role in^he functioning of the mammalian body. In the central nervous system, 5-HT is an important neurotransmitter and neioromodulator that is implicated in such diverse behaviors and responses as sleeping, eating, locomotion, perceiving pain, learning and memory, sexual behavior, controlling body temperature and blood pressure. In the spinal column, serotonin plays an .important role m the control systems of the afferent peripheral nociceptors (Moulignier, Rev. Neurol 150:3-15,(1994)). Peripheral functions in the cardiovascular, hematological and gastrointestinal systems have also been ascribed to 5-HT. 5-HT has been found to mediate a variety of contractile, secretory, and elcctraphysiologic effects including vascular and nonvascular smooth muscle contraction, and platelet aj^regan'on. (Fuller, Biology ofSerotonergic Transmission, 1982; BouHin, Serotonin In Mental Abnormalities 1:316 (197S); Barenas, et al., Serotonin and Behavior, (1973)) The 5-HT2A receptor subtype (also referered to as subclass) is widely yet discretely expressed in the human brain, including many cortical, limbic, and forebram regions postulated to be involved in the modulation of higher cognitive and affective functions. This receptor subtype is also expressed on mature platelets where it mediates, in part, platelet aggregation, one of the initial steps in the process of vascular thrombosis.<br>
Given the broad distribution of serotonin within the body, it is understandable that tremendous interest in drugs that affect serotonergic systems exists (Gershon, et<br>
1<br><br>
WO 01/66521	PCT/US01/07187<br>
al.. The Peripheral Actions of 5-Hydroxytryptamine, 246 (1989); Saxena, et aL, J Cardiovascular Pharmacol 15: Supp. 7 (1990))   Serotonin receptors are members of a large human gene family of membrane-spanning proteins that function as transducers of intercellular communication. They exist on the surface of various cell types, including neurons and platelets, where, upon their activation by either their endogenous Hgand serotonin or exogenously administered drugs, they change their conformational structure and subsequently interact with downstream mediators of cellular signaling. Many of these receptors, including the 5-HT2A subclass, are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that signal by activating guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G-proteins), resulting in the generation, or inhibition of, second messenger molecules such as cyclic AMP, inositol phosphates, and diacylglyceroL These second messengers then modulate the function of a variety of intracellular enzymes, including kinases and ion channels, -which ultimately affect cellular excitability and function.<br>
At least 15 genetically distinct 5-HT receptor subtypes have been identified and assigned to one of seven families (5-HT1-7)   Each subtype displays a unique distribution, preference for various Ugands, and functional correlate^).<br>
Serotonin may be an important component in various types of pathological conditions such as certain psychiatric disorders (depression, aggressiveness, panic attacks, obsessive compulsive disorders, psychosis, schizophrenia, suicidal tendency), certain neurodegenerarjve disorders (Alzheimer-type dementia, Parkinsonism, Hnntington's chorea), anorexia, bulimia, disorders associated with alcoholism, cerebral vascular accidents, and migraine (Mcltzcr, Netiropsychopharmocology, 21:106S-l I5S (1999); Barnes &amp; Sharp, S&amp;trani'Mrmncoloty, 38:1033-1152 (1999); Gknnon. Neurpsd. BiobekavioraJ Rev^ 14:35 (1990)). Rscert evidence strongh-implicates the 5-HT2 receptor subtype in the etiology of such medical conditions as hypertension, thrombosis, migraine, vasospasm, ischemia, depression, anxiety, psychosis, schizophrenia, sleep disorders and appetite disorders.<br>
Schizophrenia is a particularly devastating neuropsychiatric disorder that affects approximately 1% of the human population. It has been estimated that the total financial cost for the diagnosis, treatment, and lost societal productivity of individnals affected by this disease exceeds 2% of the gross national product (GNP) of the United States. Current treatment primarily involves phannacotherapy with a class of drugs known as antipsychotics. Antipsychotics are effective in ameliorating<br>
2<br><br>
WO 01/66521	PCT/US01/07187<br>
positive symptoms (e.g., hallucinations and delusions), yet tiaey frequently do not improve negative symptoms (e.g., social and emotional withdrawal, apathy, and poverty of speech).<br>
Cwrently, nine major classes of antipsychotics are prescribed to treat psychotic symptoms. Use of these compounds is limited, however, by their side effect profiles. Nearly all of the "typical" or older generation compounds have significant adverse effects on human motor function. These "extrapyramidal" side effects, so termed due to their effects on modulatory human motor systems, can be both acute (e.g., dystonic reactions, a potentially life threatening but rare neuroleptic malignant syndrome) and chronic (e.g., akathisias, tremors, and tardive dyskinesia). Drug development efforts have, therefore, focused on newer "atypical" agents free of these adverse effects.<br>
Antipsychotic drugs have been shown to interact with a large number of central monoaminergic neurotransmitter receptors, including dopaminergic, serotonergic, adrecergic, muscarinic, and histammergic receptors. It is likely that the therapeutic and adverse effects of these drugs are mediated by distinct receptor subtypes. The high degree of genetic and pharmacological homology between these receptor subtypes has hampered the development of subtype-selective compounds, as well as the determination of the normal physiologic 6i pathophysiologic role of any particular receptor subtype. Thus there is a need to develop drugs that are selective for individual receptor classes and subclasses amongst monoaminergic nemotransiintter receptors.<br>
The prevailing theory for the mechanism of action of antipsychotic drugs involves antagonism of dopanrine D2 receptors. UcfaitmiatdY, it is likely that atssgerrism of depamine TO receptors-also mediates the extrapyrainidal^ide effects. Antagonism of 5-HT2A is an alternate molecular mechanism for drugs with antipsychotic efficacy, possibly ihrough antagonism of heightened or exaggerated signal transduction through seroionergic systems. 5-HT2A antagonists are therefore good candidates fox treating psychosis without extrapyramidal side effects.<br>
Traditionally, these recejitors have been assumed to exist in a quiescent state unless activated by the binding of an agonist (a drug that activates a receptor). It is now appreciated that many, if not most, of the GPCR rnonoamine receptors, including serotonin receptors, can exist in a partially activated state in the absence of their endogenous agonists. This increased basal activity (constitutive activity) can be<br>
3<br><br>
WO 01/66521	PCT/US01/07187<br>
inhibited by compounds called inverse agonists. Both agonists and inverse agonists possess intrinsic activity at a receptor, in that they alone can activate or inactivate these molecules, respectively. In contrast, classic or neutral antagonists compete against agonists and inverse agonists for access to the receptor, but do not possess the intrinsic ability to inhibit elevated basal or constitutive receptor responses.<br>
We have recently elucidated an important aspect of 5-HT2A receptor function by applying the Receptor Selection and Amplification Technology (U.S. Patent 5,707,798,1998; CkemAbstr. 128:111548 (1998) and citations therein), to the study of the 5-HT2 subclass of serotonin receptors. R-SAT is a phenotypic assay of receptor ftmction that involves the beterologous expression of receptors in mammalian fibroblasts. Using this technology we were able to demonstrate that native 5-HT2A receptors possess significant constitutive, or agonist-independent, receptor activity (U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 60/103,317, herein incorportated by reference). Furthermore, by directly testing a large number of centrally acting medicinal compounds with known clinical activity in neuropsychiatric disease, we determined that compounds with anlipsychotic efficacy all shared a common molecular property. Nearly all of these compounds, which are used by psychiatrists to treat psychosis, were found to be ]x&gt;tent 5-HT2A inverse agonists. This unique clinico-pharmacologic correlation at a single receptor subtype is compelling evidence that 5-HT2A receptor inverse agonism is a molecular mechanism of antipsychotic efficacy in humans.<br>
Detailed pharmacological chiiracterization of a large number of antxDsvchotic compounds revealed that they possess broad activity at multiple related receptor subtypes. Most of tbese compounds display agonist, competitive antagonist, or inverse agonist activity at multiple monoaminergic receptor subtypes, including serotoninergic, dopaminergic, adrcncrgic, muscarinic and fcist&amp;ninergic receptors. Tins broad activity is likely responsible for the sedating, hypotensive, and motor side effects of these compounds. It would therefore be of great advantage to develop compounds that are selective inverse agonists of the 5-HT2A receptor, but which have little or no activity on other monaminie receptors subtypes, especially dopamme D2 receptors. Such compounds may be useful in the treatment of human disease (e.g., as anti-psychotics), and may avoid the adverse side effects associated with non-selective receptor interactions.<br>

Definitions<br>
For the purpose of the current disclosure, the following definitions shall in their entireties be used to define technical terms, and shall also, in their entireties, be used to define the scope of the composition of matter for which protection is sought in the claims.<br>
"Constitutive activity" is defined as the elevated basal activity of a receptor which is independent of the presence of an agonist Constitutive activity of a receptor may be measured using a number of different methods, including cellular (e.g., membrane) preparations (see, e.g., Barr &amp;. Manning, J. Biol. Chem. 272:32979-87 (1997)), purified reconstituted receptors with or without the associated G-protein in pbospbofipid vesicles (Cerionc et aL, Biochemistry 23:4519-25 (1984)), and functional cellular assays (U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 60/103,317)-<br>
" Agonist" is defined as a compound that increases the activity of a receptor when it contacts the receptor.<br>
7<br><br>
WO 01/66521	PCT/US01/07187<br>
An "antagonist" is defined as a compound that competes with an agonist or inverse agonist for binding to a receptor, thereby blocking the action of an agonist or inverse agonist on the receptor. However, an antagonist (also known as a '"neutral" antagonist) has no effect on constitutive receptor activity.<br>
An "inverse agonist   is defined as a compound that decreases the basal activity of a receptor (i.e., signalling mediated by the receptor). Such compounds are also known as negative antagonists. An inverse agonist is a ligand for a receptor that causes the receptor to adopt an inactive state relative to a basal state occurring in the absence of any ligand. Thus, while an antagonist can inhibit the activity of an agonist, an inverse agonist is a ligand that can alter the conformation of the receptor in the absence of an agonist. The concept of an inverse agonist has been explored by Bond et al. in Nature 374:272 (1995). More specifically, Bond et al. have proposed that unliganded p 2-adrenoceptor exists in an equilibrium between an inactive conformation and a spontaneously active conformation. Agonists are proposed to stabilize the receptor in an active confonnation. Conversely, inverse agonists are believed to stabilize an inactive receptor conformation. Thus, while an antagonist manifests its activity by virtue of inhibiting an agonist, an inverse agonist can additionally manifest its activity in the absence of an agonist by inhibiting the spontaneous conversion of an unliganded receptor to an active confonnation.<br>
The "5-HT2A receptor" is defined as a receptor, having an activity corresponding to the activity of the human serotonin receptor subtype, which was characterized through molecular cloning and pharmacology as detailed in Saltzman et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 181:1469-78; and Julius et al., Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 87:928-932.<br>
The term "subject   refers to sn animal^ preferably a mammal, most preferably a human, who is the object of treafcrsnt, observation or experiment<br>
"Selective" is defined as a property of a compound whereby an amount of the compound sufficient to effect a desired response from a particular receptor type, subtype, class or subclass with substantially little or no effect upon the activity other receptor types. "Selectivity   or "selective,   as an inverse agonist is understood as a property of a compound of the invention whereby an amount of compound that effectively inversely agonises the 5-HT2A receptor, and thereby decreases its activity, causes little or no inverse agonistic or antagonistic activity at other, related or<br>
8<br><br>
WO 01/66521	PCT/US01/07187<br>
unrelated, receptors. In particular, the compounds of the invention have surprisingly been found not to interact strongly with other serotonin receptors (5-HT 1A, IB, ID, IE, IF, 2B, 2C, 4A, 6, and 7) at concentrations where the signalling of the 5-HT2A receptor is strongly or completely inhibited. Preferably, the compounds of the invention are also selective with respect to other monoamine-binding receptors, such as the dopaminergic, histaminergic, adrenergic and muscarinic receptors. Compounds that are highly selective for 5-HT2A receptors may have a beneficial effect in the treatment of psychosis, schizophrenia or similar neuropsychiatric disorders, while avoiding adverse effects associated with drugs hitherto suggested for this purpose. EC50 for an agonist is intended to denote the concentration of a compound needed to achieve 50% of a maximal response seen in R-SAT. For inverse agonists, EC50 is intended to denote the concentration of a compound needed to achieve 50% inhibition of an R-SAT response from basal, no compound, levels.<br>
As used herein, "coadministration" of pharmacologically active compounds refers to the dehvery of two or more separate chemical entities, whether in vitro or in vivo. Coadministration refers to the simultaneous delivery of separate agents; to the simultaneous delivery of a mixture of agents; as well as to the delivery of one agent followed by delivery of a second agent or additional agents. In all cases, agents that are coadministered are intended to work in conjunction with each other.<br>

In general, compounds of formula (I) are active at monoamine receptors, specifically serotonin receptors. Preferred compounds share the common property of acting as inverse agonists at fee 5-HT2A receptor. Thus, experiments performed on cells transiently expressing the human phenotype of said receptor have shown that the compounds of general formula (I) attenuate the signalling of such receptors in the absence of additional ligands acting upon the Teceptor. The compounds have thus been found to possess intrinsic activity at this receptor and are able to attenuate the basal, non-agonist-stimulated, constitutive signalling responses that the 5-HT2A receptor displays. The observation that the compunds of general formula (I) are inverse agonists also indicates that these compounds have the ability to antagonize the activation of 5-HT2A receptors that is mediated by endogenous agonists or exogenous synthetic agonist ligands.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides compounds that preferably show a relatively high degree of selectivity towards the 5-HT2A subtype of serotonin receptors relative to other subtypes of the serotonin (5-HT) family of receptors as well as to other receptors, most particularly the roonoammergic G-protein coupled receptors, such as dopamine receptors. In another preferred embodiment, the compounds of the present invention act as inverse agonists at the 5-HT2A subtype of serotonin receptors.<br>
The compoonds of genera] formula (I) znzy therefore be useful for treating or alienating symptoms of disease condraons associated with impaired function, in particular elevated levels of activity, of especially 5-HT2A receptors, whether this impaired function is associated with improper levels of receptor stimulation or phenotypicaJ aberrations.<br>
Others have previously hypothesised that certain neuropsychological diseases might be caused by altered levels of constitutive activity of monoamine receptors. Such constitutive activity might be modified via contacting the relevant receptor with a synthetic inverse agonist. By directly testing a large number of centrally acting medicinal compounds with known clinical activity in neuropsychiatric disease, we determined that compounds with antipsychotic efficacy all shared a common<br>
13<br><br>
WO 01/66521	PCTAJSO1/O7187<br>
molecular property. Nearly all of these compounds that are used by psychiatrists to treat psychosis were found to be potent 5-HT2A inverse agonists. This correlation is compelling evidence that 5-HT2A receptor inverse agonism is a molecular mechanism of antipsychotic efficacy in humans<br>
Detailed pharmacological characterization of a large number of antipsychotic compounds in our laboratory revealed that they possess broad activity at multiple related receptor subtypes. Most of these compounds display either agonist, competitive antagonist, or inverse agonist activity at multiple monoarninergic receptor subtypes including serotoninergic, dopaminergic. adrenergic, muscarinic and histaminergic receptors. This broad activity is likely responsible for the sedating, hypotensive, and motor side effects of these compounds. It follows that the compounds disclosed herein will possess efficacy as, for example, novel antipsychotics, but will have fewer or less severe side effects than existing compounds.<br>
The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising an effective amount of a compound of general formula (I).<br>

The present invention also provides a method of inhibiting an activity of a monoamine receptor. This method comprises contacting a monoamine receptor or a system containg the monamine receptor, wi:b an effective amount of a compound of formula (I). Accoding to one embodiment, the monamine receptor is a serotonin receptor. In a preferred embodiment, tbe compound is selective for the 5-HT2A receptor subclass.

The system containing the monoamine receptor may, for example, be a subject such as a mammal, non-human primate or a human. The receptor may be located in the central or peripheral nervous system, blood cells or platelets.<br>
The system may also be an in vivo or in vitro experimental model, such as a cell culture model system that expresses a monamine receptor, a cell-free extract thereof that contains a monoamine receptor, or a purified receptor. Non-limiting examples of such systems are tissue culture cells expressing the receptor or extracts or lysates thereof. Cells that may be used in the present method include any cells<br>

capable of mediating signal transaction via monoamine receptors, expecially the 5-HT2A receptor, either via endogenous expression of this receptor (e.g., certain types of neuronal cells lines, for example, natively express the 5-HT2A receptor), or following transfection of cells with plasrnids containing the receptor gene. Such cells are typically mammalian cells (or other eukaryotic cells, such as insect cells or Xenopus oocytes), because cells of lower organisms generally lack the appropriate signal transduction pathways for the present purpose. Examples of suitable cells include: the mouse fibroblast cell line NIH 3T3 (ATCC CRL 1658), which responds to transfected 5-HT2A receptors by stimulating growth; RAT 1 cells (Pace et al., Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 88:7031-35 (1991)); and pituitary cells (Vallar et al, Nature 330:556-58 (1987)). Other useful mammalian cells for the present method include HEK 293 cells, CHO cells and COS cells.<br>
The invention specifically provides methods of inhibiting an activity of a native, mutated or modified monoamine receptor. Also provided are kits for performing the same. In a preferred embodiment, the activity of the receptor is a signalling activity. In another preferred embodiment^ the activiny of the receptor is the constitutive basal activity of the receptor. Preferrably, the compound is an inverse agonist selective for the 5-HT2A receptor. Most preferably, the compound has little or substantially no activity toward other serotonergic or other monoaminergic receptors, such as dopamraergic receptors.<br>
In one embodiment, the activity of the receptor is a response, such as a signalling response, to an endogenous agonist, such as 5-HT, or an exogenous agonistic agent, such as a drug or other synthetic ligand.

Furthermore, the present invention relates to a method of inhibiting an activation of a monoamine receptor ramprising contacting the monoamine receptor, or a system containing the monoamine receptor, with one or more compounds of the invention. The activation of the receptor may be due to an exogenous or endogenous agonist agent, or may be the constitutive activation associated with a native, mutated or modified receptor. The receptor may purified or present in an in vitro or in vivo system. The receptor may also be present in the central or peripheral nervous system, blood cells or platelets of a nonhuman or human subject. Also provided are kits for performing the same.<br>

In a preferred embodiment, the compound is selective for 5-HT class serotonin receptors, more preferably, the 5-HT2A sublass of serotonin receptors. In another preferred embodiment, the compound has little or substantially no anti-dopaminergic activity.<br>
The present invention provides methods of treating a disease condition associated with a monoamine receptor comprising administering to a mammal in need of such treatment an effective amount of a compound of formula (I). The invention specifically provides methods for treating or alleviating disease conditions associated with improper function or stimulation of native, as well as mutated or otherwise modified, forms of central serotonin receptors, particularly the 5-HT class of such receptors, comprising administration of an effective amount of a selective inverse agonist of the general formula (I) to a host in need of such treatment. Also provided are kits for performing the same.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, ihe receptor is the 5-HT2A subclass. In one embodiment, the disease condition is associated with dysfunction of the serotonin receptor. In another embodiment, the disease condition is associated with activation of the serotonin receptor, preferably inappropriately elevated or constitutive activation, elevated serotonergic tone, as well as disease conditions associated with secondary cellular functions imparicd by such pathologies.<br>

It is anticipated that the compounds of this invention, particularly selective inverse agonists of 5-HT2A that show little or no activity on dopaminergic receptors, may be especially useful for treating schizophrenia. Treament using the compounds of the invention may also be useful in treating migraine, vasospasm, hypertension, various thrombotic conditions including myocardial infarction, thrombotic or ischenric stroke, idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and peripheral vascular disease. In a further embodiment the present invention provides methods for treating or alleviating a disease condition associated with improper function, dysfunction, or<br>

WO 01/66521	PCT/US01/07187<br>
stimulation of native, as well as mutated or otherwise modified, forms of central or peripheral monoamine receptors, such methods comprising administration of an effective amount of a compound of the general formula (I) to a host in need of such treatment. Preferably the monaminc receptor is serotonin receptor in the peripheral nervous system, blood or platelets; more preferably a 5-HT2A subclass receptor. In additional embodiments, the disease condition is associated with increased activity or activation of a serotonin receptor. AJso provided are kits for performing the same.<br>
The present invention also pertains to the field of predictive medicine in which pharmacogenomics is used for prognostic (predictive) purposes. Pharmacogenomics deals with clinically significant hereditary variations in the response to drugs due to altered drug disposition and abnormal action in affected persons. See e g., Eichelbaum, Clin Exp Pharmacol PhysioL, 23:983-985 (1996), and Under, Clin. Chem. 43:254-66(1997). In general, two types of pharmacogenetic conditions can be differentiated: genetic conditions n-ansmitted as a single factor altering the way drugs act on the body (altered drug action), and genetic conditions transmitted as single factors altering the way the body acts on drugs (altered drug metabolism). These pharmacogenetic conditions can occur as naturally occurring polymorphisms.<br>
One pharmacogenomics approach to identifying genes that predict drug response, known as "a genome-wide association," relies primarily on a high-resolution map of the human genome consisting of already known gene-related markers (e.g., a "bi-allelic" gene marker map that consists of 60,000-100,000 polymorphic or variable sites on the human genome, each of which has two variants). Such a high-resolution genetic map can be compared to a map of the genome of each of a statistically significant number of patients taking part in a Phase U/IH drug trial to identify markers associated with a particular observed drug response or side effect. Alternatively, such a high-resolution map can be generated from a combination of some ten-million known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human genome. As used herein, a "SNP   is a common alteration mat occurs in a single nucleotide base in a stretch of DNA. For example, a SNP may occur once per every 1,000 bases of DNA. A SNP may be involved in a disease process; however, the vast majority may not be disease-associated. Given a genetic map based on the occurrence of such SNPs, individuals can be grouped into genetic categories depending on a particular pattern of SNPs in their individual genome. In such a manner, treatment<br>
18<br><br>
WO 01/66521	PCT/USOI/07187<br>
regimens can be tailored to groups of genetically similar individuals, taking into account traits that maybe common among such genetically similar individuals.<br>
Alternatively, a method termed the "candidate gene approach" can be utilized to identify genes that predict drug response. According to this method, if a gene that encodes a drug's target is known (e.g., a protein or a receptor of the present invention), all common variants of that gene can be fairly easily identified in the population and it can be determined if having one version of the gene versus another is associated with a particular drug response.<br>
Alternatively, a method termed the "gene expression profiling", can be utilized to identify genes that predict drug response. For example, the gene expression of an animal dosed with a drug (e.g., a molecule or modulator of the present invention) can give an indication whether gene pathways related to toxicity have been turned on.<br>
Information generated from more than one of the above phannacogenomics approaches can be used to determine appropriate dosage and treatment regimens for prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of an individual. This knowledge, when applied to dosing or drug selection, can avoid adverse reactions or therapeutic failure and thus enhance therapeutic or prophylactic efficiency when treating a subject with a molecule or modulator of the invention, such as a modulator identified by one of the exemplary screening assays descril&gt;ed herein. As we have described previously, this approach can also be used to identify novel candidate receptor or other genes suitable for further pharmacological characterization in vitro and in vivo.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides methods and kits for identifying a genetic polymorphism predisposing a subject to being responsive to a compound described herein. The zrtethcxi comprises administering to &amp; subject an effective amount of a compound^ identiiying a responsive subject having'an ameliorated disease condition associated with a monamine receptor; and identifying a genetic polymorphism in the responsive subject, wherein the genetic polymorphism predisposes a subject to being responsive to the compound. It is anticipated mat this method may be useful both for predicting which individuals are responsive to therapeutic effects of a compound and also for predicting those likely to experience adverse side effect responses. This approach may be useful for identifying, for exampie, polymorphisms in a serotonin receptor that lead to constitutive activation and are thus amenable to inverse agonist therapy. In addition, this method may be useful for identifying polymorphisms that lead to altered drug metabolism whereby<br>
19<br><br>
WO 01/66521	PCT/US01/07187<br>
toxic byproducts are generated in the body   Such a mechanism has been implicated in the rare, but potentially life threatening side effects of the atypical antipsychotic, clozapine.<br>
In a related embodiment, a method for identifying a subject suitable for treatment with a compound of the present invention is provided. According to the method, the presence of a polymorphism that predisposes the subject to being responsive to the compound is detected, the presence of the polymorphism indicating that the subject is suitable for treatment. AJso provided are kits for performing the same.<br>
The compounds of this invention preferably show selective inverse agonist activity towards the 5-HT2A receptor. Such activity is defined by an ability of the ligand to attenuate or abolish the constitutive signaling activity of this receptor. Selectivity in the present context is understood as a property of a compound of the invention whereby an amount of compound that effectively inversely agonizes the 5-HT2A receptor and thereby decreases its activity causes httle or no inverse agonistic or antagonistic activity at other, related or unrelated, receptors. In particular, the compounds of the invention ha\e surprisingly been found not to interact strongly with otheT serotonin receptors (5-HT 1A, IB, ID. IE, IF, 2B, 2C, 4A, 6, and 7) at concentrations where the signaling of the 5-HT2A receptor is strongly or completely inhibited. Preferably, the compounds of tbe invention are also selective with respect to other monoamine-bicding receptors, such as the dopaminergk, histaminergic, adrencrgic and nrascarinic receptors.<br>

Consequently, the present invention also relates to a method of alleviating or treating a disease condition in which modification of monoamine receptor activity, in particular 5-HT2A serotonergic receptor activity, has a beneficial effect by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention to a subject in need of such treatment. Such diseases or conditions may, for instance arise from inappropriate stimulation or activation of serotonergic receptors. It is anticipated that by using compounds that are selective for a particular serotonin receptor subtype, m particular 5-HT2A, the problems with adverse side effects observed with the known antipsychotic drugs, such as extrapyramidal effects, may be avoided substantially.<br>
The term "therapeuhcally effective amount" as used herein means an amount of an active compound or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or medicinal response in a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician, which includes alleviation of the symptoms of the disease being treated.<br>
Advantageously, compounds of the present invention may be administered in a smgle daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses, for example, two, three or four times daily. Furthermore, compounds of the present invention may be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, via transdermal routes, using those forms of transderxnal skin patches well known to persons skilled in the art, by implantable pumps; or by any other suitable means of administration. To be administered in the form of a transdennal delivery system, for example, the dosage administration wiD,-of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.<br>
The dosage regimen utilizing the compounds of the present invention is selected in accordance with a variety of factors including type, species, age, weight, sex and medical condition of the patient; the severity of the condition to be treated; the route of administration; the renal and hepatic function of the patient; and the particular compound employed. A physician or veterinarian of ordmary skill can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the drug required to prevent, counter or arrest the progress of the disease or disorder that is being treated.<br>

The daily dosage of the products may be varied over a wide range from about 0.01 mg to about 100 mg per adult human per day. For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing 0.01,0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0,2.5, 5.0,10.0,15.0, 25.0 or 50.0 mg of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated. A unit dose typically contains from about 0.001 mg to about 50 mg of the active ingredient, preferably from about 1 mg to about 10 mg of active ingredient. An effective amount of the drug is ordinarily supplied at a dosage level of from about 0.0001 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg of body weight per day. Preferably, the range is from about 0.001 to 10 mg/kg of body weight per day, and especially from about 0.001 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg of body weight per day.<br>
Compounds according to the present invention may be used alone at appropriate dosages defined by routine testing in order to obtain optimal pharmacological effect on a monoaininergic receptor, in particular the 5-HT2A serotonergic receptor subtype, while minimizing any potential toxic or otherwise unwanted effects. In addition, co-administration or sequential administration of other agcnis that improve the effect of the compound may, in some cases, be desirable<br>
The pharmacological properties and the selectivity of the compounds of this invention for specific serotonergic receptor subtypes may be demonstrated by a number of different assay methods using recombinant receptor subtypes, preferably of the human receptors if these are available, e.g. conventional second messenger or binding assays. A particularly convenient functional assay system is the receptor selection and amplifJcatioG assay disclosed in U.S. Pat No. 5,707,798, which describes a method of screening for bioactive compounds by utilizing the ability of cells transfected with receptor DNA, e.g., coding for the different serotonergic subtypes, to amplify in the presence of a ligand of the receptor. Cell amplification is detected as increased levels of a marker also expressed by the cells. Methods o/preparation<br>

Example 42 - Receptor Selection and Amplification (R-SAT) Assays.<br>
The functional receptor assay, Receptor Selection and Amplification Technology (R-SAT), was used (with minor modifications from that previously described US 5,707,798) to screen compounds for efficacy at the 5-HT2A receptor. Briefly, NIH3T3 cells were grown in 96 well tissue culture piaies to 70-80% confluence. Cells were trdnsfected for 12-16 hours with piasmid DNAs using superfect (Qiagen Inc.) as per manufacture's protocols. R-SAT's were generally performed with 50 ng/well of receptor and 20 ng/well of Beta-galactosidase piasmid DNA.   All receptor and G-protein constructs used were in the pSI mammalian expression vector (Promega lac) as described in U.S. 5,707,798. The 5HT2A receptor gene was amplified by nested PCR from brain cDNA using the oligodeoxynucleoades based on the published sequence (i5ee Saltzman et al Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 181:1469-78 (1991)). Large-scale transfections, cells were transfected for 12-16 hours, then feypsinized and frozen in DMSO. Frozen cells were later thawed, plated at 10,000-40,000 cells per well of a 96 well plate that contained drug. With both<br>

WO 01/66521<br><br>
PCT/US01/07187<br><br>
methods, cells were then grown in a humidified atmosphere with 5% ambient CO2 for five days. Media was then removed from the plates and marker gene activity was measured by the addition of the beta-galactosidase substrate ONPG (in PBS with 5% NP-40). The resulting colorimetric reaction was measured in a spectrophotometric plate reader (Titertek Inc.) at 420 nM. All data were analyzed using the computer program XLFit (IDBSm). Efficacy is the percent maximal repression compared to repression by a control compound (ritanserin in the case of 5HT2A). pIC50 is the negative of the Iog(IC50), where IC50 is the calculated concentration in Molar that produces 50% maximal repression.

Example 137 - Receptor Selection and Amplification (R-SAT) Assays.<br>
The functional receptor assay, Receptor Selection and Amplification Technology (R-SAT), was used (with minor modifications from that previously described US 5,707,798) to screen compounds for efficacy at the 5-HT2A receptor. Briefly. NIH3T3 cells were grown in 96 well tissue culture plates to 70-80% confluence. Cells were transfected for 12-16 hours with plasnrid DNAs using supcrfect (Qiagen Inc.) as per manufacture's protocols."R-SAT's were generally performed with 50 ng/well of receptor and 20 ng/well of Beta-galactosidase plasmid DNA.   All receptor and G-protein constructs used were in the pSI mammalian expression vector (Promega Lac) as described in U.S. 5,707,798. The 5HT2A receptor gene was amplified by nested PCR from brain cDNA using the oligodeoxynucleotides based on the published sequence (see Saltzman et al Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 181:1469-78 (1991)). Large-scale transfections, cells were transfected for 12-16 hours, then trypsinized and frozen in DMSO. Frozen cells were later thawed, plated at 10,000-40,000 cells per well of a 96 well plate that contained drug. With both<br>
118<br><br>
WO 01/66521	PCT/US01/07187<br>
methods, cells were then grown in a humidified atmosphere with 5% ambient CO2 for five days. Media was then removed from the plates and maricer gene activity was measured by the addition of the beta-galactosidase substrate ONPG (in PBS with 5% NP-40). The resulting colorimetric reaction was measured in a spectrophotometric plate reader (Titertek Inc.) at 420 nM. All data were analyzed using the computer program XLFh (IDBSm). Efficacy is the percent maximal repression compared to repression by a control compound (ritanserin in the case of 5HT2A). pIC50 is the negative of the log(IC50), where IC50 is the calculated concentration in Molar that produces 50% maximal repression. The results obtained for several compounds of the invention are presented in Table 4, below.<br>

Example 139 In Vivo Pharmacology of 2-(4-Methoxyphenyl)-iV-(4-<br>
metbylbenzyI)-iV-(l-methy]piperidm-4-yI)acetamidehydrochloride(AC-90,179) Methods<br>
Animals and apparatus<br>
Instruments) were used for rat experiments (details on startle apparatus and measures, see Male Non-Swiss Albmo mice and male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley) were housed (4 mice/cage; 2 rats/cage) in rooms with temperature and humidity controlled and water and food (Harlan Teklad) freely available. Mice were kept on a 12-hr lightrdark cycle, whereas rats were kept on a 12- hr reverse light:dark cycle. For locomotor and observation experiments in mice, plastic 20x20x30cm activity cages were equipped with photocell beams (AccuScan Instruments). Startle chambers (San Diego Instruments) were used for rat experiments (for details on startle apparatus and measures, see Mansbach et al., (1988) PsycJiopharmacology 94:507-14).<br>
Procedore<br>
Observation for Head Twitches<br>
Mice were treated with 2.5 mg/kg DOI i.p. Five min later, mice were treated with AC-90179 s.c. and placed into activity cages. Ten min later, mice were observed using a repeated sampling technique. Each mouse was observed for 10 sec and rated for presence (1) or absence (0) of head twitch behavior for a total of 6 observations in 15 min and a total head twitch score of 0-6. Each dose combination was tested in a separate group of animals (n=8) and the experimenter was blind to drug conditions. Head twitch scores were averaged followed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc Durmett's t-test comparisons.<br>
Locomotor Activity<br>
For hyperactivity experiments, mice were treated with 0.3 mg/kg dizocilpine or 3.0 mg/kg d-amphetamine i.p. 15 min before the session. Five minutes after the pretreatment, mice were treated with AC-90179 s.c. and placed into the activity cages. For spontaneous activity, AC-90179 was administered alone. Locomotor data were collected during a 15 min session without habituan'on in a lit room. Each dose combination was tested in a separate group of animals (n=8). Distance traveled (cm) was calculated and averaged followed by ANOVA and post-hoc Dunnett's t-test comparisons.<br>

WO 01/66521	PCT/US01/07187<br>
Startle Testing<br>
Rats were tested and groups (n=l 0) matched for levels of startle reactivity and prepulse inhibition (PH; see Mansbach et al, (1988) Psychopharmacology 94:507-14). Two days later, test sessions started and consisted of a 5-min acclimation period with a constant background noise (65 dB), followed by 60 presentations of acoustic stimuli to measure acoustic startle responses. The 60 trials consisted of: twenty two 40-ms presentations of a 120 dB broadband pulse, ten 20-ms presentations of each prepulse intensity (68, 71, 77 dB) 100 ms prior to a 40-msec presentation of a 120 dB broadband pulse, and 8 NOSTIM trials in which no stimuli were delivered in order to assess general motor activation in the rats. Thirty min before testing, rats were treated with sterile water (s.c.), risperidone (1.0 mg/kg, i.p.), or AC-90179 (s.c). Five min later, rats were administered DOI (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) or 0.9% saline (s.c). One-week later, rats were administered the same pretreatment drug or vehicle and crossed over to receive the treatment opposite to that they received the previous week. Startle magnitudes and percent PPI for the three prepulse intensities were calculated as described elsewhere (Bakshi, et al, (1994) J. Pharmacol Exp. Ther. 271:787-94) and ANOVAs with repeated measures performed. Res alts<br>
To further characterize the clinical utility of a selective 5-HT2A receptor inverse agonist as a novel antipsychotic agent, AC-90179 was tested in head twitch, locomotOT and pre pulse inhibition behavioral models. DOI-trcatcd (2.5 mg/kg, i.p., 15 mm) mice exhibited an average head twitch score of 2.6 (± 03, S.E-M.). AC-90179 (0.1 - 30 mg/kg, ex., 10 min) caused a dose-related decrease in DOI-induced bead-twitches with a minimum effective dose of 1 mg/kg and with higher doses completely eliminating head twitch behavior (Figure 2 A).<br>
In tbe locomotor experiments (Figure 2 B), mice traveled an average of 794 cm (± 122 S.E.M.) after vehicle administration. Dizocilpinc (03 mg/kg, i-p., 15 min) and J-amphetamine (3.0 mg/kg, i.p., 15 min) caused increases in distance traveled with averages of 2625 cm (± 312) and 3367 cm (± 532), respectively. AC-90179 (03 -10 mg/kg, s.c., 10 mm) attenuated the hyperactivity induced by dizocirpinc, bat not by d-amphetarnine. The minimum effective dose against dizocilpine was 1 mg/kg, whereas AC-90179 reduced spontaneous locomotor activity only at the highest dose tested (30 mg/kg).<br>

WO 01/66521	PCT/US01/07187<br>
The 3-way repeated measures ANOVA on the PPI data from the AC-90179 groups revealed an overall effect of treatment [F(l,37) - 27.73, p    0.05) on percent PPI. Risperidone was used as a positive control because previous studies in our laboratory have suggested that it is effective in blocking the PPI-disrupbive effects of DOI. The 3-way repeated measures ANOVA on the PPI data from the risperidone group also revealed a significant effect of treatment [F(l,18)= 14.08, p 0.05). Since there were no significant interactions with prepulse intensity, title data were collapsed across the three prepulse intensities for graphical purposes.<br>
Since there was a significant pretreatment by treatment interaction, pair-wise 2-way repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted on the saline- and DOI-treated groups. In the vehicle-treated rats, there was no effect of AC-90179 (p &gt; 0.025) or risperidone (p &gt; 0.025) on PPI. hi the DOI-treated groups, there were significant effects of AC-90179 [F(3,37) = 5.68, p 
The 3-way repeated measures ANOVA on startle magnitude from the AC-90179 groups revealed a significant effect of pretreatment [F(3,37)   2.89, p = 0.048) and treatment [F(137) - 10.27, p  0.05; Fif jure 1, panel C inset). Risperidone, on fee other hand, had no effect on startle magnitude (p &gt; 0.05).<br>
