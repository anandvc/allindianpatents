				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The invention relates to the collection of physiological samples and the<br>
determination of analyte concentrations therein.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002] Analyte concentration determination in physiological samples is of ever<br>
increasing importance to today's society. Such assays find use in a variety of<br>
application settings, including clinical laboratory testing, home testing, etc., where<br>
the results of such testing play a prominent role in the diagnosis and management<br>
of a variety of disease conditions. Analytes of interest include glucose for<br>
diabetes management, cholesterol for monitoring cardiovascular conditions, and<br>
the like. In response to this growing importance of analyte concentration<br>
determination, a variety of analyte concentration determination protocols and<br>
devices for both clinical and home testing have been developed.<br>
[0003] In determining the concentration of an analyte in a physiological sample, a<br>
physiological sample must first be obtained. Obtaining the sample often involves<br>
cumbersome and complicated devices which may not be easy to use or may be<br>
costly to manufacture. Furthermore, the procedure for obtaining the sample may<br>
be painful. For example, pain is often associated with the size of the needle used<br>
to obtain the physiological sample and the depth to which the needle is inserted.<br>
Depending on the analyte and the type of test employed, a relatively large, single<br>
needle or the like is often used to extract the requisite amount of sample.<br>
[0004] The analyte concentration determination process may also involve a<br>
multitude of steps. First, a sample is accessed by use of a skin-piercing<br>
mechanism, e.g., a needle or lancet, which accessing may also involve the use of a<br>
sample collection mechanism, e.g., a capillary tube. Next, the sample must then<br>
be transferred to a testing device, e.g., a test strip or the like, and then oftentimes<br>
the test strip is then transferred to a measuring device such as a meter. Thus, the<br>
steps of accessing the sample, collecting the sample, transferring the sample to a<br>
biosensor, and measuring the analyte concentration in the sample are often<br>
performed as separate, consecutive steps with various device and instrumentation.<br>
[0005] Because of these disadvantages, it is not uncommon for patients who<br>
require frequent monitoring of an analyte to simply become non-compliant in<br>
monitoring themselves. With diabetics, for example, the failure to measure their<br>
glucose level on a prescribed basis results in a lack of information necessary to<br>
properly control the level of glucose. Uncontrolled glucose levels can be very<br>
dangerous and even life threatening.<br>
[0006] Attempts have been made to combine a lancing-type device with various<br>
other components involved in the analyte concentration determination procedure<br>
in order to simplify the assay process. For example, U.S. Patent No. 6,099,484<br>
discloses a sampling device which includes a single needle associated with a<br>
spring mechanism, a capillary tube associated with a pusher, and a test strip. An<br>
analyzer may also be mounted in the device for analyzing the sample.<br>
Accordingly, the single needle is displaced toward the skin surface by un-cocking<br>
a spring and then retracting it by another spring. A pusher is then displaced to<br>
push the capillary tube in communication with a sample and the pusher is then<br>
released and the fluid is transferred to a test strip.<br>
[0007] U.S. Patent No. 5,820,570 discloses an apparatus which includes a base<br>
having a hollow needle and a cover having a membrane, whereby the base and<br>
cover are connected together at a hinge point. When in a closed position, the<br>
needle is in communication with the membrane and fluid can be drawn up<br>
through the needle and placed on the membrane of the cover.<br>
[0008] There are certain drawbacks associated with each of the above devices and<br>
techniques. For example, the devices disclosed in the aforementioned patents are<br>
complex, thus decreasing ease-of-use and increasing manufacturing costs.<br>
Furthermore, as described, a single needle design may be associated with<br>
increased pain because the single needle must be large enough to extract the<br>
requisite sample size. Still further, in regards to the '484 patent, the steps of<br>
activating and retracting a needle and then activating and retracting a capillary<br>
tube adds still more user interaction and decreases ease-of-use.<br>
[0009] As such, there is continued interest in the development of new devices and<br>
methods for use in the determination of analyte concentrations in a physiological<br>
sample. Of particular interest would be the development of integrated devices,<br>
and methods of use thereof, that are efficient, involve minimal pain, are simple to<br>
use and which may be used with various analyte concentration determination<br>
systems. However, in producing such devices the present invention places<br>
particular emphasis on issues associated with manufacturing and distribution,<br>
thereby offering more cost effective and flexible options, both to consumers and<br>
manufactures.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0010] Devices, systems and methods are provided for piercing the skin,<br>
accessing and collecting physiological sample therein, and measuring a<br>
characteristic of the physiological sample. The subject devices include at least<br>
one microneedle or skin-piercing element affixable to a test strip. The subject test<br>
strips include a biosensor, wherein the at least one skin-piercing element is<br>
separately attached to the biosensor.<br>
[0011] Preferred skin-piercing elements have a space-defining configuration in<br>
which, upon insertion into the skin, creates a space or volume within the pierced<br>
tissue. This space serves as a reservoir or pooling area within which bodily fluid<br>
is caused to pool while the skin-piercing element is in situ. A capillary channel or<br>
fluid pathway extending from the pooling space to within the test strip transfers<br>
pooled fluid present within the pooling space to the biosensor. In certain<br>
embodiments, the space-defining configuration is a recess within a surface of the<br>
skin-piercing element. Such a recess may have a concave configuration. In other<br>
embodiments, the space-defining configuration is an opening which extends<br>
transverse to a dimension of the skin-piercing element and occupies a substantial<br>
portion of a width or diameter dimension as well as a substantial portion of a<br>
length dimension of the microneedle.<br>
[0012] Generally, test strips used in connection with the needle or lance members<br>
of the present inventions may include electrochemical or photometric/colorimetric<br>
sensors. Other types of test strips may be used as well.<br>
[0013] Needles or lance members according to the present invention may be<br>
affixed to test strips members in a number of ways. They may be affixed directly,<br>
e.g., using adhesive, chemical or ultrasonic welding. Alternately, mechanical<br>
attachment via clips hasps or the like may be employed.<br>
[0014] Numerous advantages are presented in so-producing completed test<br>
strips/lances member combinations.<br>
[0015] The subject systems include one or more subject test strip devices and a<br>
meter for receiving a subject test strip and for determining a characteristic of the<br>
sampled fluid, e.g., the concentration of at least one analyte in the sample,<br>
collected by within the test strip's biosensor. Moreover, such a meter may also<br>
provide means for activating and manipulating the test strip wherein the skin-<br>
piercing structure is caused to pierce the skin. Additionally, the meter may<br>
provide means for storing one or more subject test strips, or a cartridge containing<br>
a plurality of such test strips.<br>
[0016] Also provided are methods for using the subject devices, as well as kits<br>
that include the subject devices and/or systems for use in practicing the subject<br>
methods. The subject devices, systems and methods are particularly suited for<br>
collecting physiological sample and determining analyte concentrations therein<br>
and, more particularly, glucose concentrations in blood, blood fractions or<br>
interstitial fluid. The present invention further includes methods for fabricating<br>
the subject test strip devices, in which a microneedle or skin-piercing element is<br>
affixed to a complete/discrete test strip unit. The subject fabrication methods may<br>
be used to fabricate individual test strip devices or a plurality of such test strip<br>
devices on a web, film or sheet of suitable material.<br>
[0017] These and other objects, advantages, and features of the invention will<br>
become apparent to those persons skilled in the art upon reading the details of the<br>
methods and systems of the present invention which are more fully described<br>
below.<br>

Colorimetric/Photometric Sensor Variations<br>
[0030] In testers including colorimetric or photometric (herein used<br>
interchangeably) biosensor, the same is provided by at least a matrix and/or a<br>
membrane for receiving a sample and a reagent composition (set within the matrix<br>
or membrane) set upon a support structure. Where a membrane as well as a<br>
matrix is provided, the membrane will generally be placed opposite of the support<br>
structure upon the matrix. A membrane advantageously includes apertures or<br>
pores for sample access.<br>
[0031] In some embodiments, the sensor comprises a membrane containing a<br>
reagent composition impregnated therein while a matrix may or may not contain<br>
reagent composition. Often the matrix preferably provides a deposition area for<br>
the various members of the signal producing system, described infra, as well as<br>
for the light absorbing or chromogenic product produced by the signal producing<br>
system, i.e., the indicator, as well as provides a location for the detection of the<br>
light-absorbing product produced by the indicator of the signal producing system.<br>
[0032] A membrane provided may comprise a membrane that exhibits aqueous<br>
fluid flow properties and is sufficiently porous (i.e., provides sufficient void<br>
space) for chemical reactions of a signal producing system to take place. Ideally,<br>
the membrane pore structure would not support red blood cell flow to the surface<br>
of the membrane being interrogated (i.e., the color intensity of which is a subject<br>
of the measurement correlated to analyte concentration). Any matrix provided<br>
may or may not have pores and/or a porosity gradient, e.g. with larger pores near<br>
or at the sample application region and smaller pores at the detection region.<br>
[0033] Materials from which a membrane may be fabricated vary, include<br>
polymers, e.g. polysulfone, polyamides, cellulose or absorbent paper, and the like,<br>
where the material may or may not be functionalized to provide for covalent or<br>
non-covalent attachment of the various members of the signal producing system.<br>
In a tester made a thin membrane material, the tester may require less than 1/2 µl<br>
of sample to wet a sufficiently large area of the membrane to obtain a good<br>
optical measurement.<br>
[0034] Regarding suitable matrices, a number of different types have been<br>
developed for use in various analyte detection assays, which matrices may differ<br>
in terms of materials, dimensions and the like, where representative matrices<br>
include, but are not limited to, those described in U.S. Patent Nos.: 4,734,360;<br>
4,900,666; 4,935,346; 5,059,394; 5,304,468; 5,306,623; 5,418,142; 5,426,032;<br>
5,515,170; 5,526,120; 5,563,042; 5,620,863; 5,753,429; 5,573,452; 5,780,304;<br>
5,789,255; 5,843,691; 5,846,486; 5,968,836 and 5,972,294; the disclosures of<br>
which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
[0035] However configured, one or more members of a signal producing system<br>
of the biosensor produce a detectable product in response to the presence of<br>
analyte, which detectable product can be used to derive the amount of analyte<br>
present in the assayed sample. In the subject test strips, the one or more members<br>
of the signal producing system are preferably associated with (e.g., covalently or<br>
non-covalently attached to) at least a portion of (i.e., the detection region) the<br>
matrix or membrane, and in many embodiments to substantially all of the same.<br>
[0036] The signal producing system may comprise an analyte oxidation signal<br>
producing system. By analyte oxidation signal producing system, it is meant that<br>
in generating the detectable signal from which the analyte concentration in the<br>
sample is derived, the analyte is oxidized by a suitable enzyme to produce an<br>
oxidized form of the analyte and a corresponding or proportional amount of<br>
hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide is then employed, in turn, to generate<br>
the detectable product from one or more indicator compounds, where the amount<br>
of detectable product generated by the signal measuring system, i.e. the signal, is<br>
then related to the amount of analyte in the initial sample. As such, the analyte<br>
oxidation signal producing systems present in the subject test strips are also<br>
correctly characterized as hydrogen peroxide based signal producing systems.<br>
[0037] Hydrogen peroxide based signal producing systems include an enzyme<br>
that oxidizes the analyte and produces a corresponding amount of hydrogen<br>
peroxide, where by corresponding amount is meant that the amount of hydrogen<br>
peroxide that is produced is proportional to the amount of analyte present in the<br>
sample. The specific nature of this first enzyme necessarily depends on the nature<br>
of the analyte being assayed but is generally an oxidase or dehydrogenase. As<br>
such, the first enzyme may be: glucose oxidase (where the analyte is glucose), or<br>
glucose dehydrogenase either using NAD or PQQ as cofactor; cholesterol oxidase<br>
(where the analyte is cholesterol); alcohol oxidase (where the analyte is alcohol);<br>
lactate oxidase (where the analyte is lactate) and the like. Other oxidizing<br>
enzymes for use with these and other analytes of interest are known to those<br>
skilled in the art and may also be employed. In those preferred embodiments<br>
where the reagent test strip is designed for the detection of glucose concentration,<br>
the first enzyme is glucose oxidase. The glucose oxidase may be obtained from<br>
any convenient source (e.g. a naturally occurring source such as Aspergillus niger<br>
or Penicillum, or recombinantly produced).<br>
[0038] The second enzyme of such a signal producing system is an enzyme that<br>
catalyzes the conversion of one or more indicator compounds into a detectable<br>
product in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, where the amount of detectable<br>
product that is produced by this reaction is proportional to the amount of<br>
hydrogen peroxide that is present. This second enzyme is generally a peroxidase,<br>
where suitable peroxidases include: horseradish peroxidase (HRP), soy<br>
peroxidase, recombinantly produced peroxidase and synthetic analogs having<br>
peroxidative activity and the like. See, e.g., Y. Ci, F. Wang; Analytica Chimica<br>
Acta, 233 (1990), 299-302.<br>
[0039] Indicator compound or compounds provided are preferably ones that are<br>
either formed or decomposed by the hydrogen peroxide in the presence of the<br>
peroxidase to produce an indicator dye that absorbs light in a predetermined<br>
wavelength range. Preferably the indicator dye absorbs strongly at a wavelength<br>
different from that at which the sample or the testing reagent absorbs strongly.<br>
The oxidized form of the indicator may be a colored, faintly-colored, or colorless<br>
final product that evidences a change in color of the testing side of the membrane.<br>
That is to say, the testing reagent can indicate the presence of glucose in a sample<br>
by a colored area being bleached or, alternatively, by a colorless area developing<br>
color.<br>
[0040] Indicator compounds that are useful in the present invention include both<br>
one- and two-component chromogenic substrates. One-component systems<br>
include aromatic amines, aromatic alcohols, azines, and benzidines, such as<br>
tetramethyl benzidine-HCl. Suitable two-component systems include those in<br>
which one component is MBTH, an MBTH derivative (see e.g., those disclosed in<br>
U.S. Patent Application S/N 08/302,575), or 4-aminoantipyrine and the other<br>
component is an aromatic amine, aromatic alcohol, conjugated amine, conjugated<br>
alcohol or aromatic or aliphatic aldehyde. Exemplary two-component systems are<br>
3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone hydrochloride (MBTH) combined with<br>
3-dimethylaminobenzoic acid (DMAB); MBTH combined with 3,5-dichloro-2-<br>
hydroxybenzene-sulfonic acid (DCHBS); and 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone<br>
hydrazone N-sulfonyl benzenesulfonate monosodium (MBTHSB) combined with<br>
8-anilino-l naphthalene sulfonic acid ammonium (ANS). In certain<br>
embodiments, the dye couple MBTHSB-ANS is preferred.<br>
[0041] In yet other embodiments of colorimetric sensors that may be used in the<br>
present invention, signal producing systems that form a fluorescent detectable<br>
product (or detectable non- fluorescent substance, e.g. in a fluorescent<br>
background) may be employed, such as those described in Kiyoshi Zaitsu,<br>
Yosuke Ohkura, New fluorogenic substrates for Horseradish Peroxidase: rapid<br>
and sensitive assay for hydrogen peroxide and the Peroxidase, Analytical<br>
Biochemistry (1980) 109, 109-113. Examples of such colorimetric reagent test<br>
strips suitable for use with the subject invention include those described in U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 5,563,042; 5,753,452; 5,789,255, herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Electrochemical Sensor Variations<br>
[0042] Instead of using a colorimetric sensor as described above, the present<br>
invention may employ an electrochemical sensor. Typically, an electrochemical<br>
sensor comprises at least a pair of opposing electrodes, although electrochemical<br>
test strips with planar electrodes may be used in the present invention.<br>
[0043] Where opposing-electrode type strips are employed, at least the surfaces<br>
of electrodes facing each other are comprised of a conductive layer such as a<br>
metal, where metals of interest include palladium, gold, platinum, silver, iridium,<br>
stainless steel and the like as well as carbon (conductive carbon ink) and indium<br>
doped tin oxide.<br>
[0044] One conductive layer is preferably formed by sputtering a thin layer of<br>
gold (Au), the other by sputtering a thin layer of palladium (Pd). Alternately, the<br>
electrodes may be formed by screen printing a selected conductive pattern,<br>
including conductive leads, with a carbon or metal ink on the backing surfaces.<br>
An additional insulating layer may be printed on top of this conductive layer<br>
which exposes a precisely defined pattern of electrodes. However formed, after<br>
deposition of conductive layers, the surface may be subsequently treated with a<br>
hydrophilic agent to facilitate transport of a fluid sample into the reaction zone<br>
there between. Depending on the voltage sequence applied to the cell, one<br>
electrode may serve as a counter/reference electrode and the other as the working<br>
electrode of the electrochemical cell. However, where a double pulse voltage<br>
waveform is employed, each electrode acts as a counter/reference and working<br>
electrode once during analyte concentration measurement.<br>
[0045] Regardless of reaction zone or electrode configuration, a reagent coating is<br>
typically provided therein. Reagent systems of interest typically include an<br>
enzyme and a redox active component (mediator). The redox component of the<br>
reagent composition, when present, is made up of one or more redox agents. A<br>
variety of different redox agents (i.e., mediators) are known in the art and include:<br>
ferricyanide, phenazine ethosulphate, phenazine methosulfate, pheylenediamine,<br>
1-methoxy-phenazine methosulfate, 2,6-dimethyl-1,4-benzoquinone, 2,5-<br>
dichloro-l,4-benzoquinone, ferrocene derivatives, osmium bipyridyl complexes,<br>
ruthenium complexes, and the like. In many embodiments, the redox active<br>
component of particular interest is ferricyanide, and the like. The enzyme of<br>
choice may vary depending on the analyte concentration which is to be measured.<br>
For example, suitable enzymes for the assay of glucose in whole blood include<br>
glucose oxidase or dehydrogenase (NAD or PQQ based). Suitable enzymes for<br>
the assay of cholesterol in whole blood include cholesterol oxidase and esterase.<br>
[0046] Other reagents that may be present in the reaction area include buffering<br>
agents (e.g., citraconate, citrate, malic, maleic, phosphate, "Good" buffers and the<br>
like); divalent cations (e.g., calcium chloride, and magnesium chloride);<br>
surfactants (e.g., Triton, Macol, Tetronic, Silwet, Zonyl, Aerosol, Geropon,<br>
Chaps, and Pluronic); and stabilizing agents (e.g., albumin, sucrose, trehalose,<br>
mannitol and lactose).<br>
[0047] Examples of electrochemical biosensors suitable for use with the subject<br>
invention include those described in co-pending U.S. Application Serial Nos.<br>
09/333,793; 09/497,304; 09/497,269; 09/736,788 and 09/746,116, the disclosures<br>
of which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Test Strip Systems and Use<br>
[0048] As mentioned above, the subject devices may be used in the context of a<br>
subject system, which generally includes a system capable of obtaining a<br>
physiological sample and determining a property of the sample, where<br>
determining the property of interest may be accomplished automatically by an<br>
automated device, e.g., a meter. The subject system is more particularly<br>
described herein in the context of analyte concentration determination. However,<br>
kits or systems according to the present invention include at least one subject test<br>
strip device 2, oftentimes a plurality of test strip devices, where the at least one<br>
test strip device comprises at least on skin-piercing element 4. The kits may also<br>
include a reusable or disposable meter 6 that may be used with disposable tests<br>
strip devices. Further, test strip kits may include a control solution or standard<br>
(e.g., a glucose control solution that contains a standardized concentration of<br>
glucose). A kit may also include instructions for using test strips according to the<br>
invention in the determination of an analyte concentration in a physiological<br>
sample. These instructions may be present on one or more of container(s),<br>
packaging, a label insert or the like associated with the subject test strips.<br>
[0049] When a plurality of test strip devices is provided, they may be collectively<br>
packaged within a cartridge, which may be reusable or disposable. Certain of<br>
such kits may include various types of test strip devices, (e.g., electrochemical<br>
and/or colorimetric test strip devices). These various test strip devices may<br>
contain the same or different reagents.<br>
[0050] Regardless of the nature of the constituent components of any systems<br>
according to the present invention, the subject test strip devices, (whether<br>
electrochemical, colorimetric or otherwise), are preferably configured and adapted<br>
to be inserted into the meter. More specifically, as illustrated in FIG 1, test strip<br>
device 2 has a first end 8 and a second end 10, wherein the skin-piercing or<br>
lancing blade or needle 4 is associated with first end 8 and at least the second end<br>
10 is configured for insertion into meter 6.<br>
[0051] Meter 6 preferably has an ergonomically-designed housing 12 having<br>
dimensions which allow it to be comfortably held and manipulated with one hand.<br>
Housing 12 may be made of a metal, plastic or other suitable material, preferably<br>
one that is light weight but sufficiently durable. The distal portion 14 of the<br>
housing provides an aperture 16 through which test strip device 2 is advanced<br>
from a retracted position within meter 6 to an extended position wherein at least a<br>
portion of the test strip microneedle/lancet 4 extends a distance outside aperture<br>
16.<br>
[0052] Distal portion 14 further defines a chamber in which test strip device 2 is<br>
received within a. test strip receiving mechanism 18. Test strip device 2 may be<br>
inserted into meter 6 by removing distal housing portion 14 from housing 12 and<br>
inserting test strip device 2 into test strip receiving mechanism 18. Alternatively,<br>
test strip device 2 may be inserted into meter 6 and received into mechanism 18<br>
via aperture 14.<br>
[0053] Preferably, distal housing portion 14 is transparent or semi-transparent to<br>
allow the user to visually confirm proper engagement between test strip device 2<br>
and receiving area 18 prior to conducting the analyte concentration assay, as well<br>
as to visualize the test site and to visually confirm the filling of strip 2 with body<br>
fluid during the assay (especially if electronic sensing is not provided to discern<br>
the same). When test strip device 2 is properly seated within receiving<br>
mechanism 18, the biosensor with test strip device 2 operatively engages with the<br>
meter's testing components. In the case of electrochemical test strip<br>
embodiments, the electrodes of the biosensor operatively engage with the meter's<br>
electronics; with colorimetric test strip embodiments, the matrix or membrane<br>
area having a signal producing system is operatively aligned with the meter's<br>
optical components. The meter's electronics or optical componentry, upon<br>
sensing when the reaction zone or matrix area, respectively, within test strip<br>
device 2 is filled with the sampled fluid, supplies an input signal to the test strip<br>
biosensor and receives an output signal therefrom which is representative of the<br>
sample fluid characteristic being measured.<br>
[0054] Circumferentially positioned about aperture 16 is a pressure ring 20, the<br>
distal surface of which is applied to the skin and encircles the piercing site within<br>
the skin during a testing procedure. The compressive pressure exerted on the skin<br>
by pressure ring 20 facilitates the extraction of body fluids from the surrounding<br>
tissue and the transfer of such fluid into test strip device 2.<br>
[0055] Distal housing portion 14 is preferably itself in movable engagement with<br>
meter 6 wherein distal housing portion 14 is slightly translatable or depressible<br>
along a longitudinal axis of the meter. Between distal housing portion 14 and the<br>
a proximal portion of housing 12, is a pressure sensor 22 which senses and gauges<br>
the amount of pressure exerted on distal housing portion 14 when compressing<br>
pressure ring 20 against the skin. Pressure sensor 22 is preferably an electrical<br>
type sensor which may be of the kind commonly known in the field of electronics.<br>
Pressure sensor indicators 24, in electrical communication with pressure sensor<br>
22, are provided to indicate the level of pressure being applied to distal housing<br>
portion 14 so that the user may adjust the amount of pressure being applied, if<br>
necessary, in order to apply an optimal pressure.<br>
[0056] In many embodiments, meter 6 has a display 26, such as an LCD display,<br>
for displaying data, such as input parameters and test results. Additionally, meter<br>
6 has various controls and buttons for inputting data to the meter's processing<br>
components and for controlling the piercing action of test strip device 2. For<br>
example, lever 28 is used to retract test strip device 2 to a loaded position within<br>
meter 6 and thereby pre-load a spring mechanism (not shown) for later, on-<br>
demand extension or ejection of test strip device 2 from aperture 16 by depressing<br>
button 30. When distal housing portion 04 is properly positioned on the skin,<br>
such ejection of test strip device 2 causes microneedle 4 to instantaneously pierce<br>
the skin for accessing the body fluid therein. Buttons 32 and 34, when depressed,<br>
input signals to the meter's processing components indicating whether the<br>
measurement to be made is for testing/information purposes (and for recovering<br>
the test results from a memory means within the meter's electronics) or for<br>
calibration purposes, respectively.<br>
[0057] Meter 6 may further be configured to receive and retain a replaceable<br>
cartridge containing a plurality of the subject test strip devices. After using a test<br>
strip device, the meter may either eject the used test strip from the meter or store<br>
them for disposal at a later time. Such a configuration eliminates the necessary<br>
handling of test strips, thereby minimizing the likelihood of damage to the strip<br>
and inadvertent injury to the patient. Furthermore, because manual handling of<br>
the test strips is eliminated, the test strips may be made much smaller thereby<br>
reducing the amount of materials required, providing a cost savings. The meter<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. , entitled "Minimal<br>
Procedure Analyte Test System," having attorney docket no. LIFE-054 and filed<br>
on the same day herewith, is of particular relevance in regard to these<br>
considerations.<br>
[0058] Additionally, certain aspects of the functionality of meters suitable for use<br>
with the subject systems are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,193,873, as well as in<br>
co-pending, commonly owned U.S. Application Serial Nos. 09/497,304,<br>
09/497,269, 09/736,788, 09/746,116 and 09/923,093. Of course, in those<br>
embodiments using a colorimetric assay system, a spectrophotometer or optical<br>
meter will be employed, where certain aspects of the functionality of such meters<br>
suitable for use are described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,734,360,<br>
4,900,666, 4,935,346, 5,059,394, 5,304,468, 5,306,623, 5,418,142, 5,426,032,<br>
5,515,170, 5,526,120, 5,563,042, 5,620,863, 5,753,429, 5,773,452, 5,780,304,<br>
5,789,255, 5,843,691, 5,846,486, 5,968,836 and 5,972,294.<br>
[0059] In use, the subject invention provides methods for determining a<br>
characteristic of the sample, e.g., the concentration of an analyte in a sample. The<br>
subject methods find use in the determination of a variety of different analyte<br>
concentrations, where representative analytes include glucose, cholesterol, lactate,<br>
alcohol, and the like. In many embodiments, the subject methods are employed to<br>
determine the glucose concentration in a physiological sample. Test devices 2<br>
according to the present invention are particularly suited for use in determining<br>
the concentration of an analyte in blood or blood fractions, and more particularly<br>
in whole blood or interstitial fluid.<br>
[0060] In practicing the subject methods, at least one subject test strip device as<br>
described above, is provided, and a subject microneedle 4 thereof is inserted into<br>
a target area of skin. Typically, the skin-piercing element is inserted into the skin<br>
of a finger or forearm for about 1 to 60 seconds, usually for about 1 to 15 seconds<br>
and more usually for about 1 to 5 seconds. Depending on the type of<br>
physiological sample to be obtained, the subject skin-piercing element 4 may be<br>
penetrated to various skin layers, including the dermis, epidermis and the stratum<br>
corneum, but in many embodiments will penetrate no farther than the<br>
subcutaneous layer of the skin.<br>
[0061] While the subject test strips may be handled and inserted into the skin<br>
manually, the subject test strips are preferably used with a hand-held meter such<br>
as described above. As such, a single test strip device 2 is either initially inserted<br>
into test strip meter or the test strip may be provided by a pre-loaded cartridge<br>
(not shown). In the latter approach embodiment, the cartridge is preferably<br>
removably engageable with meter 6. Used strips may be automatically disposed<br>
of, e.g., either ejected from the meter or deposited into a separate compartment<br>
within the cartridge, while an unused test strip is automatically removed from the<br>
cartridge and inserted into a receiving area of the meter.<br>
[0062] Once test strip device 2 is properly received within mechanism 18, it may<br>
then be spring loaded or cocked by means of lever 28, thereby retracting the test<br>
strip device 2 and preparing it for firing. Meter 6 is then positioned substantially<br>
perpendicular to the targeted skin surface wherein distal housing portion 14, and<br>
more specifically pressure ring 20, is caused to contact the target skin area. Some<br>
compressive pressure may be manually applied to the target skin area, i.e., by<br>
pressing the distal end of meter 14 against the target skin area, to ensure that skin-<br>
piercing element 4 is properly inserted into the skin. By applying such pressure, a<br>
counter force causes distal housing portion 14 to press back upon pressure sensor<br>
22.<br>
[0063] The relative amount (i.e., high, normal and low) of counter pressure is<br>
then measured and displayed by optional pressure sensor indicators 24.<br>
Preferably, the amount of pressure applied should generally be in the "normal"<br>
range. Indicators 24 inform the user as to when too much or too little pressure is<br>
being applied. When the indicators show that the applied pressure is "normal",<br>
the user may them depress the spring-release button 30. Due to the spring force<br>
released, receiving/carrying mechanism 18 and test strip device 2 are caused to<br>
thrust forward thereby causing skin-piercing element 4 to extend from aperture 16<br>
and puncture the targeted skin area.<br>
[0064] Whether by manual means or by use of meter 6, the penetration of skin-<br>
piercing element 4 into the skin may create a fluid sample pooling area (defined<br>
by the recess or opening within skin-piercing element variations shown in FIGs<br>
4A-7 and described further therewith). In which case, sample fluid enters the<br>
pooling area by the open-space configuration (e.g., recess or opening, within skin<br>
piercing element 4), and possibly also from the opposite side of the skin-piercing<br>
element. The pooled sample fluid is then transferred directly to the reaction zone<br>
of a test strip or thereto by a fluid pathway by at least a capillary force exerted on<br>
the pooled fluid. Where no enlarged pooling area is provided, a simple capillary<br>
channel may prove effective in certain situations as well, though such a set-up<br>
may not be most preferred.<br>
[0065] In any case, the transfer of fluid from the wound site to the biosensor may<br>
be further facilitated by exerting physical positive pressure circumferentially<br>
around the penetration site by means of a pressure ring 20 or by applying a source<br>
of negative pressure through the fluid channel thereby vacuuming the body fluid<br>
exposed to the distal end of the channel. Fluid passing into the biosensor reaction<br>
zone may simply fill the area or alternately be distributed by subchannels or<br>
another similar distribution feature.<br>
[0066] Once meter 6 senses that the reaction zone or matrix area is completely<br>
filled with the sample of body fluid, the meter electronics or optics are activated<br>
to perform analysis of the extracted sample. At this point, the meter may be<br>
removed by the patient from the penetration site or kept on the skin surface until<br>
the test results are shown on the display. Meter 6 may alternatively or<br>
additionally include means for automatically retracting the microneedle strip from<br>
the skin once the reaction cell is filled with the body fluid sample.<br>
[0067] With an electrochemical-based analyte concentration determination assay,<br>
an electrochemical measurement is made using the counter/reference and working<br>
electrodes. The electrochemical measurement that is made may vary depending<br>
on the particular nature of the assay and the meter with which the electrochemical<br>
test strip is employed, (e.g., depending on whether the assay is coulometric,<br>
amperometric or potentiometric). Generally, the electrochemical measurement<br>
will measure charge (coulometric), current (amperometric) or potential<br>
(potentiometric), usually over a given period of time following sample<br>
introduction into the reaction area. Methods for making the above described<br>
electrochemical measurement are further described in U.S. Patent Nos.:<br>
4,224,125; 4,545,382; and 5,266,179; as well as in International Patent<br>
Publications WO 97/18465 and WO 99/49307.<br>
[0068] Following detection of the electrochemical signal generated in the reaction<br>
zone, the amount of the analyte present in the sample is typically determined by<br>
relating the electrochemical signal generated from a series of previously obtained<br>
control or standard values. In many embodiments, the electrochemical signal<br>
measurement steps and analyte concentration derivation steps, are performed<br>
automatically by a device designed to work with the test strip to produce a value<br>
of analyte concentration in a sample applied to the test strip. A representative<br>
reading device for automatically practicing these steps, such that user need only<br>
apply sample to the reaction zone and then read the final analyte concentration<br>
result from the device, is further described in co-pending U.S. Application S/N<br>
09/333,793 filed June 15, 1999.<br>
[0069] For a colorimetric or photometric analyte concentration determination<br>
assay, sample applied to a subject test strip, more specifically to a reaction area of<br>
a test strip, is allowed to react with members of a signal producing system present<br>
in the reaction zone to produce a detectable product that is representative of the<br>
analyte of interest in an amount proportional to the initial amount of analyte<br>
present in the sample. The amount of detectable product (i.e., signal produced by<br>
the signal producing system) is then determined and related to the amount of<br>
analyte in the initial sample. With such colorimetric assays, optical-type meters<br>
are used to perform the above mentioned detection and relation steps. The above<br>
described reaction, detection and relating steps, as well as instruments for<br>
performing the same, are further described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,734,360;<br>
4,900,666; 4,935,346; 5,059,394; 5,304,468; 5,306,623; 5,418,142; 5,426,032;<br>
5,515,170; 5,526,120; 5,563,042; 5,620,863; 5,753,429; 5,773,452; 5,780,304;<br>
5,789,255; 5,843,691; 5,846,486; 5,968,836 and 5,972,294; the disclosures of<br>
which are herein incorporated by reference. Examples of such colorimetric or<br>
photometric reagent test strips suitable for use with the subject invention include<br>
those described in U.S. Patent Nos.: 5,563,042; 5,753,452; 5,789,255, herein<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
Test Strip Devices<br>
[0070] Turning now to FIGS. 2A and 2B, a first test element or tester 2 is shown.<br>
It comprises a test strip 36 and a needle/microneedle or lance/lancet portion 38<br>
(herein used interchangeably). FIG 2B shows the lance element 38 shown<br>
separately, whereas a discrete test strip 36 and lance element 38 and are affixed,<br>
held or attached to each other in FIG 2 A to form tester 2<br>
[0071] The test strip includes a biosensor 40 set upon a substrate 42. Adhesive<br>
member(s) 44 may be provided to make the connection. The biosensor shown in<br>
FIG 2A is a colorimetric-type sensor provided in connection with a membrane<br>
and/or matrix. An aperture or transparent window 46 may be provided in<br>
substrate 42 to enable sensor reading.<br>
[0072] To attach the lance element in FIG 2B to the test strip in FIG 2A adhesive<br>
member(s) 48 are applied to a base 50 of the lance element to connect it to an<br>
opposing portion of the test strip. The orientation of such members may, of<br>
course, vary. Generally they will be set so as not to interfere with relevant<br>
structure. FIGs 5 A and 5B provide an example of alternate adhesive portion<br>
placement used to attach the lance element to a test strip.<br>
[0073] Regardless of relative orientation or configuration, as with optional<br>
adhesive portions 44, adhesive portions 48 may comprise double-stick tape or<br>
directly-applied adhesive. Alternately, adhesive affixation of elements 36 and 38<br>
may be foregone in favor of mechanically welding (for instance, using<br>
ultrasonics) or chemically welding the components together. Still further,<br>
supplemental attachment members may be provided to connect a test strip with a<br>
lance element according to the present invention.<br>
[0074] An example of such an approach is shown in FIGs 3A and 3B. Here,<br>
lance member 38 includes hooks or clasp members 52 provided on opposites sides<br>
of base 50. The clips may be integrally formed in the lance element as shown, or<br>
comprise independent or discrete members themselves.<br>
[0075] The variations of the invention in FIGs 4A and 4B are shown using<br>
adhered-on lance members 38 on their respective undersides. The base of each<br>
lance member may be affixed to the test strip body 36 by an adhesive layer or<br>
layers 44. Of course clip-on lance members may alternately be used as may be<br>
other methods of connection.<br>
[0076] As shown, the lance member in FIG 4A is of a different thickness than<br>
that in FIG 4B. This is because the former is sized to be made from plastic, while<br>
it is contemplated that the latter be produced from a metal. Indeed, any of the<br>
various lance member variations shown may alternately be made of either metal,<br>
plastic, composite material, ceramic or another material and be configured<br>
accordingly. Likewise, as may already be apparent, any of the attachment<br>
approaches described may be use in or with any of the lance member variations.<br>
Still further, each of the optional features regarding needle 4 structure and fluid<br>
conveyance as described further below may be used in each of the variations with<br>
either type of test strip 36 disclosed and still others.<br>
[0077] However, details of the test strip embodiment in FIGs 4 A and 4B is first<br>
described. Specifically, this test strip 36 comprises a first electrode 54 and a<br>
second electrode 56, preferably constructed as described above in connection with<br>
electrochemical sensor production. The thickness of the any substrate material<br>
provided typically ranges from about 25 to 500 urn and usually from about 50 to<br>
400 um, while the thickness of the metal layer typically ranges from about 10 to<br>
100 nm and usually from about 10 to 50 nm.<br>
[0078] An adhesive member 58 may serve as a spacer between the electrodes,<br>
defining a reaction zone or area 60 for which the electrodes generally face each<br>
other and are separated by only a short distance, such that the spacing between the<br>
electrodes is extremely narrow. The thickness of spacer layer 58 may range from<br>
10 to 750 urn and is often less than or equal to 500 µm, and usually ranges from<br>
about 25 to 175 µm. Any spacer layer preferably has double-sided adhesive to<br>
capture the adjacent electrodes. In any case spacer layer 58 may be fabricated<br>
from any convenient material, where representative suitable materials include<br>
polyethylene terephthalate, glycol modified polyethylene terephthalate (PETG),<br>
polyimide, polycarbonate, and the like.<br>
[0079] As depicted, the working and reference electrodes are generally<br>
configured in the form of strips. Typically, the length of the electrodes ranges<br>
from about 0.75 to 2 in (1.9 to 5.1 cm), usually from about 0.79 to 1.1 in (2.0 to<br>
2.8 cm). The width of the electrodes ranges from about 0.15 to 0.30 in (0.38 to<br>
0.76 cm), usually from about 0.20 to 0.27 in (0.51 to 0.67 cm). In certain<br>
embodiments, the length of one of the electrodes is shorter than the other, wherein<br>
in certain embodiments it is about 0.135 in (3.5 mm) shorter. Preferably,<br>
electrode and spacer width is matched where the elements overlap. The spacer<br>
incorporated in the strip may be set back about 0.3 in (7.6 mm) from the end of<br>
electrode 56, leaving opening(s) 62 between the electrodes about 0.165 in (4.2<br>
mm) deep. However, configured, such opening(s) provide space for receipt of a<br>
meter probe.<br>
[0080] A vent opening 64 is provided across the reaction zone from the inlet port<br>
66. Providing a vent allows for capillary action between the electrodes to draw<br>
sample into the reaction zone without backpressure interference. Spacer layer 58<br>
is preferably configured or cut-out so as to provide a reaction zone or area with a<br>
volume in the range from about 0.01 to 10 µL, usually from about 0.1 to 1.0 µL<br>
and more usually from about0.05 to 1.0 µL. The amount of physiological sample<br>
that is introduced into the reaction area of the test strip may vary, but generally<br>
ranges from about 0.1 to 10 µl, usually from about 0.3 to 0.6 µl.<br>
[0081] Such introduction of sample is preferably accomplished at notched section<br>
68. It interfaces with features of needle 4 to pick up pooling or conveyed sample<br>
and direct it inwardly toward the test strip reaction zone, at least partially pinning<br>
the sample along the edges of the notch.<br>
[0082] As such, the variations of the invention shown in FIGs 4 A and 4B<br>
represent front-loaded test strips. Those in figures 2A and 2B are loaded with or<br>
accept sample along the face of the sensor (as present on the underside of the test<br>
strip). Still further modes of introduction are possible, however. Side loaded test<br>
strips may be employed (such as those described in the above- referenced patent<br>
application Attorney Docket Nos. LIFE-03 l/LIFE-039 with minor modifications<br>
of the lance elements depicted. Such approaches are contemplated as part of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Lance Elements<br>
[0083] Also contemplated as aspects of the present invention are various features<br>
regarding the lance elements 38 shown. In accordance with the text above, each<br>
lance element includes a lancet/needle or skin piercing element 4, typically having<br>
a pointed tip 70. In addition the body of lance 4 and base 50 may incorporate<br>
various features to collect and/or convey a biological sample to a given test strip<br>
sensor 40.<br>
[0084] Actually, any suitable shape of skin-piercing element 4 may be employed<br>
with the subject test strip devices, as long as the shape enables the skin to be<br>
pierced with minimal pain to the patient. For example, the skin-piercing element<br>
may have a substantially flat or planar configuration, or may be substantially<br>
cylindrical-like, wedge-like or triangular in shape such as a substantially flattened<br>
triangle-like configuration, blade-shaped, or have any other suitable shape. The<br>
cross-sectional shape of the skin-piercing element, or at least the portion of skin-<br>
piercing element that is penetrable into the skin, may be any suitable shape,<br>
including, but not limited to, substantially rectangular, oblong, square, oval,<br>
circular, diamond, triangular, star, etc. Additionally, the skin-piercing element<br>
may be tapered or may otherwise define a point or apex at its distal end. Such a<br>
configuration may take the form of an oblique angle at the tip or a pyramid or<br>
triangular shape or the like.<br>
[0085] The dimensions of the skin-piercing element may vary depending on a<br>
variety of factors such as the type of physiological sample to be obtained, the<br>
desired penetration depth and the thickness of the skin layers of the particular<br>
patient being tested. Generally, the skin-piercing element is constructed to<br>
provide skin-piercing and fluid extraction functions and, thus, is designed to be<br>
sufficiently robust to withstand insertion into and withdrawal from the skin.<br>
Typically, to accomplish these goals, the ratio of the penetration length (defined<br>
by the distance between the base of the skin-piercing element and its distal tip) to<br>
diameter (where such diameter is measured at the base of the skin-piercing<br>
element) is from about 1 to 1, usually about 2 to 1, more usually about 5 to 1 or<br>
10 to 1 and oftentimes 50 to 1.<br>
[0086] The total length of the skin-piercing elements generally ranges from about<br>
1 to 30,000 microns, usually from about 100 to 10,000 microns and more usually<br>
from about 1,000 to 3,000 microns. The penetration length of the skin-piercing<br>
elements generally ranges from about 1 to 5000 microns, usually about 100 to<br>
3000 microns and more usually about 1000 to 2000 microns. The height or<br>
thickness of skin-piercing elements 38, at least the thickness of the distal portion<br>
4, typically ranges from about 1 to 1000 microns, usually from about 10 to 500<br>
microns and more usually from about 50 to 250 microns. The outer diameter at<br>
the base generally ranges from about 1 to 2000 microns, usually about 300 to<br>
1000 microns and more usually from about 500 to 1000 microns. In many<br>
embodiments, the outer diameter of the distal tip generally does not exceed about<br>
100 microns and is generally less than about 20 microns and more typically less<br>
than about 1 micron. However, it will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that<br>
the outer diameter of the skin-piercing element may vary along its length or may<br>
be substantially constant.<br>
[0087] Regarding the fluid-conveying features noted as may be incorporated in<br>
lance element 38, one variation incorporates only a channel 72, preferably of<br>
capillary dimensions, for this purpose. Configured to work with the test strips in<br>
FIGs 2A and 3A, the channel preferably extends a sufficient length so that it is in<br>
fluid communication with the sensor matrix or membrane. The channel may be<br>
open on either one side (thereby taking the form of a trench) or both. The channel<br>
length is preferably limited to match-up with intended target in order to avoid<br>
inadvertent loss of sample fluid.<br>
[0088] FIGs 4A and 4B show a somewhat different lance configuration. In each<br>
figure, a recessed polling area 74 is provided. No capillary is required to carry<br>
fluid from the pooling area since (as noted above) fluid is able to directly transfer<br>
from the lancet 4 to access port 66 in this variation of the invention. The purpose<br>
of the recessed or space-defining area in the variations shown in FIGs 4A and 4B<br>
(as well as in FIGs 5 A-7) is to create a space or volume within the pierced tissue.<br>
This space serves as a reservoir within which bodily fluid is caused to pool in situ<br>
prior to being transferred to the biosensor portion of the subject test strip devices.<br>
As such, the availability of a greater volume of body fluid can be provided with a<br>
tip that is smaller and/or sharper than conventional microneedles, thereby<br>
reducing pain. The greater availability of body fluid also results in a faster<br>
collection rate of sampling.<br>
[0089] Generally, the space-defining lancet configurations of the present<br>
invention create or define a space within the pierced tissue having a volume at<br>
least as great as the available fluid volume in the reaction zone of the biosensor.<br>
Such space or volume ranges from about 10 to 1,000 nL, and more usually from<br>
about 50 to 250 nL. Such volume occupies a substantial portion of the entire<br>
volume occupied by the structure of the skin-piercing element, and ranges from<br>
about 50% to 99% and more usually from about 50% to 75% of the entire volume<br>
occupied by the skin piercing element.<br>
[0090] The lance member variations shown in FIGs 5A-7 incorporate a channel<br>
72 and a recess 74. The variations in FIGs 5 and 6 include an opening 76 adjacent<br>
the pooling region as well. The pooling area opening in the former variations is<br>
best pictured in FIG 5B. The purpose of such an opening (and for providing an<br>
open capillary in the lance member variations referenced above from FIGs 2A-<br>
3B) is to further expose the sample-gathering structure area to the outside<br>
environment, thereby increasing the volume and flow rate of body fluid into the<br>
area.<br>
[0091] As illustrated, the recesses and/or openings may occupy a substantial<br>
portion of the width of their respective skin-piercing elements, as well as a<br>
substantial portion of a length dimension. Side walls 78 defining each of the<br>
structures will have a thickness sufficient to maintain the structure of the<br>
microneedle when subject to normal forces, but may be minimized in order to<br>
maximize negative space for collecting sample.<br>
[0092] Another optional feature or set of features that may be employed,<br>
especially in connection with a fluid conveying channel 72 incorporated in a lance<br>
element is shown in each of FIGs 5A-7. The features being referred to are the<br>
secondary fluid transfer pathways 80. These elements, set in fluid communication<br>
with channel 72 convey sample outwardly, dispersing the same across the sensor<br>
employed in an opposing, attached test strip.<br>
[0093] Like channel 72, pathways or channels 80 are preferably dimensioned so<br>
as to exert a capillary force on fluid within the pooling area defined by the open<br>
space portion of the microneedle, and draws or wicks physiological sample to<br>
within the reaction zone or matrix area of the biosensor. As such, the diameter or<br>
width of a single fluid channel or pathway does not exceed 1000 microns and will<br>
usually be about 100 to 200 microns in diameter. This diameter may be constant<br>
along its length or may vary. It may be preferred that sub-channels 80 have cross-<br>
sectional diameters in the range from about 1 to 200 microns and more usually<br>
from about 20 to 50 microns in that they are not required to convey the same<br>
volume of fluid as a primary channel 72.<br>
[0094] In the illustrated embodiments, branch channels 80 extend perpendicularly<br>
from channel 72; however, they may extend angularly from their respective<br>
channels. Another variation concerning lance member configuration relative to<br>
channels 80 is to inset or surround the same within base as shown in FIG 7.<br>
Accomplished in this manner or another way, bounding the area to which<br>
channels 80 can convey fluid can be employed to ensure that sample is directed<br>
fully and only to a reaction or sensor area of the test strip 36 employed with lance<br>
element 38.<br>
[0095] In certain embodiments of the invention, the fluid pathway may further<br>
include one or more agents to facilitate sample collection. For example, one or<br>
more hydrophilic agents may be present in the fluid pathway, where such agents<br>
include, but are not limited to types of surface modifiers or surfactants such as<br>
mercaptoethane sulfonic acid (MESA), Triton, Macol, Tetronic, Silwet, Zonyl,<br>
Aerosol, Geropon, Chaps, and Pluronic.<br>
Test Strip Device Fabrication<br>
[0096] Many of the techniques described in U.S. Application Atty Docket No.<br>
LIFE-035 entitled "PHYSIOLOGICAL SAMPLE COLLECTION DEVICES<br>
AND METHODS OF USING THE SAME" are applicable to fabricating test strip<br>
devices as described herein - especially those details regarding needle/lance<br>
production. Details as to electrochemical test strip production may also be<br>
appreciated in view of Application Atty Docket Nos. LIFE-031 entitled<br>
"SOLUTION DRYING SYSTEM" and LIFE-039 entitled "SOLUTION<br>
STRIPING SYSTEM".<br>
[0097] A primary distinction, however, between the approach taught in the former<br>
application and that taught herein, is that in the present invention complete test<br>
strips may be provided, to which lance elements are attached as auxiliary<br>
structure. FIGs 2 A and 3 A provide examples of such an approach. Alternately,<br>
test strips adapted for use with the lance elements of the invention may be<br>
provided, to which lance elements are affixed. FIGs 4A and 4B provide examples<br>
of such an approach.<br>
[0098] In either case, it is possible to separately produce or procure lance and test<br>
strip elements that are later brought together. The initially independent nature of<br>
the products/devices permits relatively optimized manufacture. In contrast, in the<br>
integral test strip devices described in the above-referenced application, certain<br>
considerations of material selection and manufacturing processes applicability<br>
that do not necessarily affect manufacture of the present invention.<br>
[0099] One example of the flexibility offered by producing test strip devices<br>
according to the present invention by affixing a lance element to an otherwise<br>
complete test strip is that a user may feasibly take such action. This may be<br>
especially true for the clip-type embodiments disclosed (or variations of the<br>
embodiments shown in which clip-type structure may be employed.) By virtue of<br>
such flexibility, there is market opportunity for selling lance members for use<br>
with any of a variety of commercially available test strips to be used with a meter<br>
according to the present invention. Of course, flexibility exists in designing the<br>
lance elements so they will interface (by clips, adhesive or other means) with a<br>
wide variety of test strips - both, present and future.<br>
