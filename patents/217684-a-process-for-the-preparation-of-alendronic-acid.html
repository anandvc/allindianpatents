				<td>NOVEL PROCESS FQRPREPARING ALENDRONIC ACID<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENIflON<br>
The present invention relates to new chemical orocesses for manufacturing bisphosphonic acids, and in particular for manufacturing alerdronic<br>
acid,<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Alendronate sodium, 4-amino-l-bydroxybutylidene-1,1-bisphosphonic acid monosodium, having the formula(Formula Removed)<br>
is an agent for combating bone resorption in bone diseases inc uding osteoporosis and Paget's disease.<br>
Various methods for preparing 4-amino-l-hydroxybutylidene-l,l-bisphosphonic acid, or alendronic acid, are known in the art and have been disclosed in M.I. Kabachnik et al., Synthesis and Acid-Base and Complcxing Properties of Amino-Substituted alpha-hydroxylakylidene-diphosphonic Ac ds, Izu, Akad. Nauk USSR, Ser. Khim, 2,433 (1978) and in U.S. Patent numbers 4,407,761, 4,621,077, 4,705,651, 5,039,819 and 5,159,108.<br>
A well known process for preparing alendronic acid is as follows (see also e.g. GB 2118042):                                                                     				<br>
(Formula Removed)  <br>
Alendronic Acid<br>
It has been reported that a solidification problen, occurs when this process is performed on a large scale. The abbreviation GABA is defined hereinafter as 4(gamma)-aminobutyric acid,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,922,007 describes the preparation of alendronate sodium in trihydrate form, wherein 4-aminobutyric acici is reacied with phosphorous acid and phosphorous trichloride in the presence of methanesul Tonic acid followed by the addition of sodium hydroxide. However, it has been reported that methanesulfonic acid reacts with the phosphorus trichloride and under adiabatic conditions the reaction becomes self-heating at 85"C, and an uncontrolled excitherm occurs at &gt;140°C.<br>
WO 98/34940 describes a process for preparing ilendronic acid, which comprises reacting 4-aminobutyric acid with phosphorous acid and phosphorous trichloride in the presence of polyalkylene(glycol). However, il was reported chat large quantities of polyalkylene(glycol) as well as toluene participate in this reaction, which renders it inefficient on a large scale.<br>
Thus, there remains a need for a homogeneous, safe and efficient process for preparing alendronic acid,<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for preparing of alendronic acid, which comprises the steps of: (Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R is an imido group; and<br>
R1 is selected from the group which consists of chlora, bromo, iodo. fluoro, hydroxy,<br>
amino, -OR2 or -OC(0)R2, wherein R1 is C1-C12 alky], C1-C12 cycloalkyl, or C1-C12<br>
aryl;<br>
b)	reacting th« product of step (a) with a deprotettting agent; and<br>
c)	recovering alendronic acid.<br>
R is preferably selected from the group which jonsists of N-phthalimido and N-mEileimido.<br>
R! is preferably selected from the group which consists of chloro, bromo and hydroxy.<br>
Optionally, the reaction of step (a) may be assi; ted with one or more of the compounds selected from the group which consist; of H3PO)4, PC13, PCl3 and POC13.<br>
The deprotecting agent of step (b) may be a nor-oxidizing acid, preferably selected from the group which consists of HCI and HBr; or selected from the group that consists of HBr together with acetic acic, H3P03 andH3PO4.<br>
The present invention also relates to the product made from this process.<br>
ETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
N'phthalimido-OABA andN-phthalimido-GABA chloride are known (See GB 2,248,063 page 5 line 8-10, incorporated hersin by reference). N-maleimido-GABA is also known [See J. Med. Chem., 18,1004,(1975), incorporated herein by reference].<br>
According to the present invention in step (a) tie compound of formula I is reacted with H3PO3<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
wherein:<br>
R is an imido group; and<br>
R! is selected from the group which consists of'chloro, bromo, iodo, J'luoro, hydroxy, amino, -OR: or -OC(O)R2, wherein R2 is C1-C12 alky!, C1-C|2 cycloalkyl, or C,-C12 aryl;<br>
compound of formula 1 with H3P03 without the need to use an assisting agent. In other cases it is necessary to use one or more activating agents selected from the group which consists of PC13, PCI, and POC13.<br>
As it will be seen in the examples, according to some embodiments of the present invention, the reaction of step (a) may be psrfornnel by using H3F03 as a solvent. According to other embodiments, when a solidification problem occurs, a further solvent such as H3PO4 may be used in order to :so!ve this problem.<br>
In step (b), the product of step (a) is reacted with a deprotectir.g agent.The compound resulting from this step is alendronic acid.<br>
The process of the present invention may be f erformed as a "one pot" process.<br>
