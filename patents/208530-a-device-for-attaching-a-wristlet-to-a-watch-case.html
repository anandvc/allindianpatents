OFA/TOF FOR ATTACHING A BRACELET TO A WATCHCASE<br>
The present: invention concerns; a  bracelet or wristlet to a watchcase Lueludinq a m i ddle part fitted with a pair of horns log attaching the wristlet, and more particularly a device of this type allowing the wristlet to be interchanged simply, without using tools and without risking damaging the watchcase and/or the wristlet.<br>
Generally, watch wristlets are fixed onto watchcases with horns by means of bars onto which the strands of the wristlet are attached, the ends of the bars being fixed to the horns of the watchcase. The m- t commonly used bars are called spring bars and include two pivots at their ends. The pivots are mobile within a central *~ube and are subjected to the action of a spring housed witnin the tube which pushes them outwards. The horns are respectiv- y fitted with holes in which the bar, pivots enter. Both horns are parallel to each other and generally spaced apart by 10 to 20 mm.<br>
Such a system for attaching the wristlet to the  has the drawback of generally requiring the intervention of a specialist for detaching the wristlet when the latter has to be replaced by another one. Further, this detaching operation is performed with the aid of a tool, for example tweezers or a knife, which risks damaging the watchcase. This system is consequently not very satisfa- ory and does not meet current market requirements which :, jmand wristlet attaching devices allowing users easily to replace their wristlet with another by themselves. One may also wish to adapt the type of wristwatch to the circumstances at any time of the day and thus to be able to change the wristlet easily oneself, for example to have a wristlet matching the colour of one's clothes.<br>
A main object of  invention  thus to over the drawbacks of the aforementioned prior art by providing a secure and inexpensive device for rapidly attaching a<br><br>
watch wristlet, which can easily be implemented by the user himself, which fits any type of wristlet and which does not impair the aesthetic appearance of the watch.<br>
The invention thus concerns a device for attaching a wristlet to a watchcase including a middle pare comprising a pair of attachment horns for the wristlet, this device allowing instantaneous attaching and detaching of a wristlet strand to t) middle part without using a tool and without any particular knowledge or visual inspection, characterised in that one of the ends of the wristlet is attached to a plate including two pairs of catches, and co-operating with two pairs of grooves provided in lateral faces of the horns.<br>
As a result of these features, the user can easily detach or attach the wristlet to a watchcase by inserting the catches into the grooves with whi h they are associated and wedging them on the bottom oL said grooves.<br>
Another advantage of the present attaching device lies in the fact that the points of connection of the wristlet to the watchcase are multiplied by two, providing fast and reliable attachment.<br>
A further advantage of the present attaching device lies in the fact that it may be used without discrimination with flexi;-l.e straps, for example made of leather or fabric, and with metal link bracelets.<br>
According to one feature of the invention, each pair of grooves includes a rectilinear groove and a curved groove having a rectilinear insertion port ion expended by a return portion.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment oE the Invention, the  catches  are  arranged  respect- the longitudinal edges of said plate and l; ho groovru; are arranged on the lateral walIs of the horns t.<br>
Other advantages and features of the invention will appear more clearly upon reading the following description of an embodiment of the invention given solely by way of<br><br>
Illust rat ive and non-limiting example, said description being made with reference to the drawings in which :<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view of the attachment device according to the invention;<br>
Figures 2 and 3 are partial cross-sections showing the shapes of the grooves arranged in the device of the invention; and<br>
Figures 4, 5 and 6 show respectively in order, the relative positions of the catches in the grooves during assembly of the wristlet to a watchcase using an attachment device according to the invention.<br>
Figure 1 is a partial perspective view of a watchcase including a middle part 2 and one end of: a wristlet: 1 intended to be attached in a hinged manner to middle part 2 using the device according to the invention. Middle part 2 includes two pairs of attachment horns 2e for wristlet 1, a single pair of said horns 2e being shown in Figure 1. The two pairs of horns 2e are placed in a conventional manner on opposite sides of middle part 2, at 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock. Within the context of the invention, w horns " shall be understood to mean any element of any shape used to attach wristlet 1 to the watchcase. These horns 2e may match the general shape of middle part 2, but not necessarily. It will be noted that attachment elements which are barely fastened to middle part 2, or not attached to the middle part at all, or which are added onto the watchcase, are also included in this general definition of " horns ".<br>
According to this new invention, the holes within horns 2e are replaced by two pairs of grooves 2a, 2b and 2c, 2d. Grooves 2b and 2c are straight/rectsilinear and vertical, while grooves 2 a and 2d are curved, thus allowing wristlet 1 to be guided until it is wedged. Curved grooves 2a, 2d have a rectilinear insertion portion extended by a return portion. Rectilinear grooves 2b, 2c are proximal and curved grooves 2a and d are distal relative to middle part 2 . As is shown particularly clearly in Figure 3, the return portions extend towards<br><br>
the exterior of middle part 2 and the rectilinear insertion portion and the return portion preferably form an acute angle with each other, typically of the order of 45°.<br>
According to the invention, wristlet 1 includes a plate 4, preferably rigid and slightly curved, matching the shape of the wrist and fitted with four catches lau.. lb, 1c and Id which will be inserted in grooves 2a, 2b, 2c and 2d arranged within horns 2e, more precisely on the lateral walls of said horns 2e facing each other. Catch- *s la, lb, 1c and Id are preferably arranged at*-the free end of plate 4 and are disposed respectively1 along the external longitudinal edges of said plate.<br>
Said catches la, lb, 1c and Id can be made industrially in the form of through pins, catches welded or set on plate 4 or attached thereto by any other means, or they may also form an integral part of plate 4. Plate 4 may also be perforated, grooved or indented to facilitate the fitting of any type of wristlet (made of leather, metal, plastic, fabric, rubber, etc.). Since plate 4 is identical on each side of middle part 2, it is thus possible to reverse each half wristlet in order to satisfy the requirements of right-handed and left-handed users. Since plates 4 should prel■rably be rigid, the use of any material allowing this may be envisaged.<br>
With reference to the drawings, for the operation of this new invention, it is sufficient to place plate 4 between horns 2e of middle part 2, to slide catchus Id and la into grooves 2a and 2d, then to pull plate 4 upwards and to the right as is shown in Figure 4, by rocking plate 4 downwards, catches la and Id then coming automat, really to the bottom of grooves 2a and 2d while lifting catches lb and lc into grooves 2b and 2c as is shown in. Figure 5. By continuing the same movement, catches lb, lc automatically rise and abut the bottom of grooves 2b, 2c thereby instantaneously attaching plate 4, and thus wristlet 1, to middle part 2, and thus to the watch, without any securing device, as is shown in Figure 6. The<br><br>
final stage, of fastening comprises attaching the watch to the wrist.<br>
In order to remove plate 4 from the watch, or in other words, from middle part 2, it is sufficient to perform the maneuver in reverse.<br>
According to an alternative embodiment of the invention, which is not shown, a stop in the form of a ball for example biased by a spring, a bump or any other mechanical means may be added onto middle part 2 or plate 4.<br>
The shape of middle part 1, horns 2e arid plate 4 and the proportions thereof are obviously not limiting.<br>
The invention provides :<br>
rapid, secure and easy attachment of a wristlet to a watch without using a tool;<br>
stability of the wristwatch on the wrist without gripping the latter excessively;<br>
twice the normal security and robustness (four connection points instead of two generally).<br><br><br><br>
