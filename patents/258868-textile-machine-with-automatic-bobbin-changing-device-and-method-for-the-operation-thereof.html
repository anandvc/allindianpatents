Textile machine with automatic bobbin changing device and method for the operation thereof<br>
The invention relates to a textile machine, for preference a spinning, winding, or twisting machine or a flyer, with an automatic bobbin changing device, referred to hereinafter as a doffer, and a method for the operation thereof, in accordance with the independent Claims.<br>
Textile machines, in particular spinning, winding, or twisting machines and flyers, nowadays frequently comprise, in addition to the machine itself, also devices for changing and conveying material carriers. For ring-spinning machines, for example, endless conveyor belts for bobbins are known, which convey the empty bobbins to the spinning positions and convey the full bobbins or cops away from them- These endless conveyor belts support the doffing process and are, as a ruleT arranged in such a way that, after the doffing process, the full bobbins are conveyed either to a downstream winding machine or into a cop holder, while at the same time empty bobbins are provided as replacements. On these endless conveyor belts, which, as long as the machine is in operation, constantly carry full and empty bobbins around the machine, are arranged, for example, plate-shaped bobbin carriers with a mounting for accommodating the bobbins.<br>
When the bobbins have been wound with a specific quantity of yarn, i.e. when the cops are regarded as finished according to a set standard, the textile machine stops the spinning, winding, or twisting process. The doffer then begins its work: The doffer plate carries the empty bobbins upwards in the direction of the working position with the full cops, in order for them to be changed, Depending on the system, the bobbins can be changed at different positions on the doffer path, and also in different manners. In any event, for this procedure the full cops must be conveyed past the empty bobbins at some point<br><br>
Such devices, which have long been described in the prior art, for replacing and conveying bobbin carriers have proved their value in practice thousands of times over. Many spinning mills, particularly in high-wage countries, could no longer do without this practical device, which makes optimum use of the spatial and temporal circumstances in the textile process. However, if one of these circumstances changes, such a device from the prior art cannot be flexibly adapted. Particular problems arise if one wishes or is compelled to use particularly large bobbins for conveying yam. There are a variety of reasons as to why this may be conceivable, but among them in particular is economy of operation.<br>
Particularly large packages do not in this situation mean particularly large bobbins in the first instance, but large cops. Because the annular diameter must, according to the technology, be at least 3 mm larger than the diameter of the finished cop, cops with a particularly large diameter bring particularly large rings with them during ring spinning, and, by analogy, with funnel or hopper or cap spinning this means particularly large funnels or hoppers. The dimensioning of the different textile machines, however, is a spatial economic consideration and does not allow for the bobbins to come any closer to one another: So does "particularly |argeÂ» (ring/cops/funnel) mean just about 2-4 mm larger than the normal measure. Even if this might still be feasible in terms of spinning technology, i.e. when spinning with large rings, for example, that the spinning balloons do not touch each other, this close approach has proved to be an insurmountable obstacle for automatic bobbin changing, or doffing. The working positions are as a rule so close together that it is not possible for a particularly large completely wound bobbin to be brought past the adjacent empty bobbins during doffing without complications. Depending on the oversize, it is possible that the bobbins will not be able to be guided past one another at all, that they will fall to the ground, that, as a result of this, or due to the rubbing of the bobbins against one another, the wound yam will suffer damage. In any event, problems will arise which render the use of the doffer<br><br>
with large bobbins, and with cops in particular, questionable and in most cases even impossible.<br>
Accordingly, the problem arises from the prior art of providing a textile machine with an automatic bobbin changing device which is also suitable for particularly large bobbins, and in particular for particularly large cops.<br>
This problem is resolved according to the invention in that a type of intermediate storage device is provided for the bobbins. This intermediate storage device can be realised in various different ways, which should be explained in greater detail by the description of the Figures. The Figures show embodiment examples of the particular realisation in each case, which are by no means to be regarded as limitative.<br>
Accordingly, Fig. 1 shows a diagrammatic representation of a textile machine 1, represented here as a spinning machine, with different working or spinning positions 3, as well as a drafting device 2 and a doffer 7. Bobbins 5 are inserted onto the spindle bearing plate 6 as well as on the doffer beam 19. Because the machine is represented in a possible position of the doffing process, there are no bobbins to be seen on the endless conveyor belt 4. The intermediate storage device 8 is in this situation designed as an additional rail (or belt) with movable components 10. This is represented here in a preferred location, and specifically at the bobbin changing device 7, in particular at the foot of this bobbin changing device 7. Accordingly, it is always moved in common with this. It is understood that, depending on the doffing system, it is also located in a fixed manner on another plane, or can be designed so as to be capable of being moved up and down and/or so as to be capable of pivoting.<br>
Fig. 2 shows an enlarged section from Fig. 1, namely the intermediate storage device 8. The movable bobbin carriers 10, for preference pivotable or tiltable, are<br><br>
provided with a mounting 9 for accommodating the bobbin. These bobbin carriers 10 are subjected to pressure via a pressure line 11, so that they can pivot outwards and inwards or tilt forwards and backwards for the bobbin change. Naturally, in this situation neither the material nor the shape of the bobbin carriers 10 are of importance, but only the function. It is therefore entirely feasible that further components may be present for supporting the rotational or tilting movement.<br>
Fig. 3 shows another possible embodiment of the intermediate storage device 8. In this case, it is realised not as an additional rail with various different components for mounting for preference on the doffer beam, but instead is integrated into the existing conveying system 4. The drawing shows a preferred embodiment of the bobbin conveying system 4 with bobbin carriers in plate form 13, with mountings 14 for accommodating bobbins 18 or cops 17, The bobbin carriers 13 are accommodated and conveyed by conveying elements 15. These conveying elements make provision in the prior art for a mounting for accommodating bobbins at the height of the mounting in the bobbin carrier, so that cops 17 and empty bobbins stand parallel to one another during doffing. For the use of particularly large cops, a mounting 9 is required according to the invention at another position, in other words offset by a sufficient distance interval to the position of the bobbin carrier mounting 14. Here a variant is represented with which the intermediate storage device 8 is provided as a fixed carrier 10, which as such is provided slightly tilted in relation to the conveying position. It is designed for preference as a part of the conveyor element 15. It is therefore also conceivable for the entire conveyor element 15 to be designed as slightly tilted in the direction of conveying.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a variant on Fig. 3. The mounting 9 for accommodating bobbins 5, i.e. empty bobbins 18 or cops 17, is arranged on a movable element 16 on the conveyor element 15 of the bobbin conveying system 4. The element 16, which in<br><br>
this case serves as the intermediate storage device 8, can be designed to be movable upwards and downwards as well as to the side also.<br>
The illustrations in Figures 3 and 4 are characterised by a particularly good adaptation capability, even on existing systems, and by their economical realisation as well as highly economical performance.<br>
The different variants represent the realisation of the one concept of the invention of the intermediate storage device for bobbins, offset in relation to the positron of a bobbin (empty or full) on the bobbin conveying device in each case, and/or to the bobbin changing device, with sufficient distance interval between them, for the doffing process with particularly large cops, whether as an independent device or as a supplementary device to the existing installation.<br><br>
