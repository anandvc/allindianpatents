EXPANDABLE SPINAL FUSION DEVICE<br>
AND METHODS OF PROMOTING SPINAL FUSION<br>
5 	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
	The present invention relates to an implant device to be placed into a portion of the<br>
	intsrvertabral space between adjacent vertebrae. Specifically, the invention concerns an<br>
	expandable osteogenic fusion device that may enhance arthrodesis or fusion between<br>
10	adjacent vertebral bodies while also maintaining the height of the mtervertebral space at<br>
	the instrumented vertebral level.<br>
		In many cases, low back pain originates from damages or defects in a spinal disc<br>
	between adjacent vertebral bodies. The disc can be hemiated or can be affected by a<br>
	variety of degenerative conditions. Frequently, pathologies affecting the spinal disc can<br>
15	disrupt the normal anatomical function of the disc. In some cases, this disruption is<br>
	significant enough that surgical intervention is indicated.<br>
		In one such surgical treatment, the affected disc is essentially removed and the<br>
	adjacent vertebral bodies are fused together. In this treatment, a discectomy procedure is<br>
	conducted to remove the disc nucleus while retaining the atmulus. Since the disc material<br>
20	has been removed, an implant must be placed within the intervertebral space to prevent the<br>
	space from collapsing.<br>
		In early spinal fusion techniques, bone material, or bone osteogenic fusion devices,<br>
	were simply disposed between adjacent vertebral bodies, typically at the posterior aspect<br>
	of the vertebral bodies. In the early history of these bone osteogenic fusion devices, the<br>
25	devices were formed of cortical-cancellous bone which was generally not strong enough to<br>
	support the weight of me spinal column at the instrumented level. Consequently, the spine<br>
	was stabilized by way of a plate or a rod spanning the affected vertebral bodies. With this<br>
	technique, once fusion occurred across the vertebral bodies and incorporated the bone<br>
	osteogenic fusion device, the hardware used to maintain the stability of the spine became<br>
30	superfluous.<br>
		Following me successes of the early fusion techniques, focus was directed to<br>
	modifying the device placed within the intervertebral space. Attention was then turned to<br><br><br>
WO2004/026188 	PCT/US2003/029155<br>
2<br>
	implants, or interbody fusion devices, that could be interposed between the adjacent<br>
	vertebral bodies, maintain the stability of the disc interspace, and still permit tone fusion<br>
	or arthrodesis. These intefbody fusion devices have taken many forms. For example, one<br>
	prevalent form is a cylindrical hollow implant or "cage". The outer wall of the cage<br>
5	creates an interior space within the cylindrical implant that is filled with, for example,<br>
	bone chips or other bone growth-inducing material. In recent years compounds known as<br>
	bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) have become the preferred bone growth inducing<br>
	material.In some cases, the cylindrical implants included a threaded exterior to permit<br>
	threaded insertion into a tapped bore formed in portions of the adjacent vertebral bodies.<br>
10	Alternatively, some fusion implants have been designed to be impacted into the<br>
	interveriebral space. Yet another class of fusion implants can be placed in between<br>
	adjacent vertebral bodies and then expanded to contact the opposing surfaces of the<br>
	vertebral bodies.<br>
		Experience with some interbody fusion devices has demonstrated the efficacy of<br>
15	some such implants in yielding a solid tone fusion. Variations in the design of the<br>
	implants have accounted for improvements in stabilizing the motion segment while fusion<br>
	occurs. Nevertheless, with some of the interbody fusion devices, there remains difficulty<br>
	in achieving a complete fusion, at least without the aid of some additional stabilizing<br>
	device, such as a rod or plate. Moreover, some of the devices are not structurally strong<br>
20	enough to support some loads and bending moments applied at certain levels of the spine.<br>
		Further difficulty has been encountered when a surgeon, desiring to avoid removal<br>
	of the spinal facet joints laterally, uses an undersized interbody fusion cage in a posterior<br>
	humbar interbody fusion procedure (PLIF). Use of undersized devices results in sub-<br>
	optimal contact with the endplates of adjacent vertebral bodies and consequent sub-<br>
25	optimal bone formation inside the device, and can lead to pseudoarthiosis. Additionally,<br>
	undersized devices may not provide adequate disc space distraction and nerve root<br>
	decompression. Due to the high degree of anatomical and physiological variation<br>
	encountered in all surgery, efforts to avoid utilization of a posteriory undersized implant<br>
	can require the availability of numerous devices of different dimensions, and increase the<br>
30	time required to carry out the surgical procedure, thus increasing the cost and risk<br>
	associated with the procedure. Some prior efforts to address this difficulty through use of<br><br><br>
-WO2004/026188 	PCT/US2003/029155<br>
3<br>
	expandable devices Have utilized designs involving numerous parts, or designs that apply<br>
	excessive stress force to the device, resulting in device strain. These design approaches<br>
	increase the risk of mechanical failure- Also, they may occlude the space between<br>
	vertebral body endplates, inhibiting fusion from adequately occurring.<br>
5		Even with devices that do not have the aforementioned difficulties, still other<br>
	undesirable characteristics exist Studies have suggested that the interbody fusion implant<br>
	devices, especially those implants of the "cage" design, lead to stress-shielding of bone<br>
	material within tie cage. It is well known that bone growth is enhanced by stressing or<br>
	loading the bone material. The stress-shielding phenomenon relieves some or all of the<br>
10	load applied to the bone material to be fused, which can greatly increase the time for<br>
	complete bone fusion, or disturb the quality and density of the ultimately formed fusion<br>
	mass. In some instances, stress-shielding can cause the bone chips or fusion mass<br>
	contained within the fusion cage to resorb or evolve into fibrous tissue rather than into a<br>
	bony fusion mass.<br>
15	A further difficulty encountered with many fusion implants is that the material of the<br>
	implant is not radiolucent. Most fusion cages are formed of metal, such as stainless steel,<br>
	titanium or porous tantalum. The metal of the cage shows up prominently in any<br>
	radiograph (x-ray) or computer tomography (CT) scan. Since "cage" type fusion devices<br>
	surround and contain the bone graft material housed within a metal cage, the developing<br>
20	fusion mass within the cage cannot be seen under traditional radiographic visualizing<br>
	techniques, and can be seen in CT scans only with the assistance of image scatter<br>
	techniques. Thus, the spinal surgeon does not have adequate means to determine the<br>
	progress of the fusion, and in some cases cannot ascertain whether the fusion was<br>
	complete and successful.<br>
25	Thus, the field of spinal fusion lacks a suitable intervertebral fusion device that can<br>
	be made small enough to facilitate insertion in the mtervertebral space and support bone<br>
	growth material within the mtervertebral space and expand to maintain the normal height<br>
	of the disc space. Further, current spinal fusion devices do not sufficiently reduce the risk<br>
	of stress-shielding the fusion mass and do not enable visualization, of the fusion mass as<br>
30	the arthrodesis progresses. So, there remains a need for improvements in osteogenic<br><br><br>
WO2004/026188	PCT/US2003/029155<br>
4<br>
	fusion device technology, particularly devices that provide expandable characteristics.<br>
	The present invention addressee this need in a novel and non-obvious fashion.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
5		To address the current needs with respect to interbody fusion devices, tbe present<br>
	invention contemplates an expandable oatecgenic fusion device for promoting osteogeiric<br>
	fusion in an intervertebral disc space between adjacent vertebral bodies. The device<br>
	includes a first configuration to enable placement with minimal surgical exposure for<br>
	access to the apace and a second configuration that expands in five space to provide proper<br>
10	disc space distraction, Further, the expanded device enables retention of an optimum<br>
	amount of bone growth fusion material and placement of the bone growth inducing<br>
	material into contact with adjacent bone.<br>
		In one embodiment, the expandable implant includes a cam. The cam is in contact<br>
	with an interior surface of a first member. The first member contacts a portion of one of<br>
15	the adjacent vertebral bodies. The cam is alsoin contact with an interior surface of a <br>
	second member. The second member contacts a portion of the other of the adjacent<br>
	vertebral bodies. The implant can be expanded by simply turning the cam, and thereby<br>
	without the cam undergoing substantial translational displacement, to cause one of the first<br>
	member and the second member to move slightly away from five other for the desired<br>
20	expansion.<br>
		Another embodiment of the present invention also contemplates an expandable<br>
	implant for promoting osteogenic fusion in an intervertebral disc space between adjacent<br>
	vertebral bodies. This embodiment includes a first member for contacting a portion of one<br>
	of the adjacent vertebral bodies and a second member for contacting a portion of the other<br>
25	of the adjacent vertebral bodies- The first member has a bore define therein. The bore is<br>
	threaded along substantially its entire length. This embodiment further includes a screw<br>
	having a threaded region and further having a region of gear teeth. The threaded region of<br>
	the screw is at least partially threaded into the bore. The screw contacts the second<br>
	member in a manner permitting the screw to rotate. This embodiment further includes an<br>
30	axle having a threaded region. The threaded region of the axle engages the gear teeth of<br><br><br>
WO2004/026188	PCT/US2003/029155<br>
5<br>
	the strew to function as a worm and pinion gear assembly operable to produce the desired<br>
	expansion.<br>
		Yet another embodiment of the present invention contemplates an expandable<br>
	implant for promoting osteogenic fusion in an intervertebral disc space between adjacent<br>
5	vertebral todies. This embodiment includes a first member for contacting one of the<br>
	adjacent vertebral bodies and a second member for contacting the other of the adjacent<br>
	vertebral bodies. This embodiment further includes a rack having a plurality of gear teeth.<br>
	The rack is in contact with one of the first member and the second member. As axle<br>
	having a pinion gear is farther included. 11K axle is coupled to the other of the first<br>
10	member and the second member in a manner that allows the axle to rotate. The pinion<br>
	gear of the axle contests at least one of the plurality of gear teeth of the rack to form a rack<br>
	and pinion operable for the expansion.<br>
		Still another embodiment of the present invention contemplates an expandable<br>
	implant for promoting osfeogenic fusion in an intervertebral disc space between adjacent<br>
15	vertebral bodies, and includes first and second initially abutting each other. The first<br>
	member is substantially adjacent to one of the vertebral bodies. The second member is<br>
	substantially adjacent to the other vertebral body. A spring for expanding the implant<br>
	from a first configuration to a second configuration is also included is this embodiment<br>
	The spring is compressed when the implant is in the first configuration. One portion of the<br>
20	spring is in physical contact with the first member and another portion of the spring is in<br>
	physical contact with the second member.<br>
		In still another embodiment of the present invention an expandable implant tor<br>
	promoting osteogsoic fusion in an intervertebral disc space between adjacent vertebral<br>
	bodies includes first and second initially abutting each other. The first member is<br>
25	substantially adjacent to one of the vertebral bodies. The second member is substantially<br>
	adjacent to the other vertebral body. A manufactured body for expanding the implant<br>
	from a first configuration to a second configuration is also included. The manufactured<br>
	body is capable of assuming a first state and a second state, A first portion of the<br>
	manufactured body is in physical contact with the first member and a second portion of the<br>
30	manufactured body is in physical contact with the second member to spread the first and<br>
	second after insertion into the intervertebral space.<br><br>
WO2004/026188	PCT/US2003/029155<br>
6<br>
		An additional set of embodiments much like those summarized above is provided<br>
	with a rectangular external cross-sectional shape instead of the circular external cross-<br>
	sectional shape.<br>
		An additional embodiment of the present invention contemplates a method of<br>
5	promoting osteogenic fusion of adjacent vertebral bodies. The method includes the step of <br>
	providing an expandable implant that defines a void intermediate a part of the implant and<br>
	one of the vertebral bodies when the implant is substantially adjacent to the vertebral<br>
	body. The stop of positioning the expandable implant substantially intermediate a first<br>
	vertebral body and a second vertebral body is further included in the present embodiment<br>
10	of the invention. Still further included is the step of expanding the implant while<br>
	maintaining the void.<br>
		In the various embodiments of the present invention, the expandable implant<br>
	maintains intervertebral disc space between adjacent vertebral bodies while providing a<br>
	void intermediate the vertebral bodies where the bone growth inducing material may be<br>
15	packed, thereby minimizing the above-mentioned stress-shielding of bone material while<br>
	enabling radiographic visualization of the developing fusion mass.<br>
		Therefore, embodiments of the present invention provide an improved expandable<br>
	osteogenic fusion device. Numerous advantages and additional aspects of the present<br>
	invention will be apparent from the description of the preferred embodiments and drawings<br>
20	that follow.<br>

15 	DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS<br>
		For the purpose of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention,<br>
	reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings and specific<br>
	language will be used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no<br>
	limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended. Such alterations and further<br>
20	modifications in the illustrated device and such further applications of the principles of the<br>
	invention as illustrated therein as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which<br>
	the invention relates are contemplated as within the scope of the invention.<br>
		The drawings show various embodiments of an implant for insertion into the<br>
	intervertebral space between adjacent vertebrae and include fixst and second end members<br>
25	for engaging respective ones of the adjacent vertebrae, and an expansion member for<br>
	changing the implant from a first state suitable for insertion into the intervertebral space<br>
	between the distracted vertebrae, to a second state suitable for maintaining a<br>
	predetermined spacing between ihe adjacent vertebrae, The expansion member may<br>
	include any system or mechanism for changing the spacing between upper and lower<br>
30	portions of the first end member and upper and lower portions of the second end member<br>
	in a direction substantially aligned with the longitudinal axis of the spine at the site of the<br><br><br>
WO2004/026188	PCT/US2003/0291559<br>
9<br>
	adjacent vertebra, while maintaining substantially the same position in an axis<br>
	perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the spine. Additionally, the first and second end<br>
	members nave lateral portions that are spaced apart and define an intermediate chamber<br>
	between the adjacent vertebrae suitable for retaining a bone growth-inducing material.<br>
5	The expanded end members can handle loads imposed while maintaining tie<br>
	predetermined spacing during fusion. By communicating with the adjacent vertebrae, the<br>
	intermediate chamber allows the transmission of loads from one vertebrae to the adjacent<br>
	vertebrae through flue bone growth inducing material, thereby facilitating fusion. Thus, the<br>
	implant maintains the predetermined spacing between the adjacent vertebrae while<br>
10	promoting fusion of the adjacent vertebrae through the bane growth inducing material.<br>
		In accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention, an expandable<br>
	osteogenic fusion implant 8, depicted in FIGS- 1 -7, has a cam-action expansion member.<br>
	implant 8 includes cams 10 connected at opposite ends of a connecting member 20, and<br>
	two end members 307 respectively; enclosing each cam. Cams 10 have an outer surface<br>
15	that contacts a first portion of the inner surface of each of the ends 10 when the implant is<br>
	not expanded, but when rotated as in FIG. 4, the cams 10 contact a second portion of each<br>
	of the end members 30. The end members 30 further include exterior surfaces 32 that<br>
	contact the endplates of the vertebral bodies 21 and 22, respectively, above and below the<br>
	disc space "S” of FIG. 1 when the implant is in an expanded configuration. Exterior<br>
20	surfaces 32 may include a hone engaging configuration 65, such as feeads or ridges to<br>
	promote a secure positioning of the implant or to enable insertion of the implant Tbe<br>
	implant transforms from the non-expanded configuration to the expanded configuration<br>
	by, for example, a rotation of the cams 10 about the longitudinal axis of connecting<br>
	member 20. As the cams 10 rotate, they exert forces on surfaces 31 of end members 30<br>
25	that cause end members 30 to move apart from one another. By selecting the size and<br>
	configuration of the cooperating surfaces of the cams 10 and end members 30, the<br>
	expansion of the implant can he controlled to provide desired distraction of adjacent<br>
	vertebral bodies and nerve root decompression. Expansion distances of one to eight<br>
	millimeters, depending on the size and shape of 1fce implant such as one to three for small,<br>
30	one to six for medium, and one to eight fox large, are examples. It will be appreciated by<br>
	one of ordinary skill in the art (hat cams 10, while illustrated as largely identical in FIG.. 1,<br><br>
WO2004/026188 	PCT/US2003/029155<br>
	may have different shapes, sizes and configurations from one another. Similarly, one of<br>
	ordinary skill in. the art will recognise that end members 30 while illustrated as<br>
	substantially identical in FIG. 1, may also have different shapes, sizes and configurations<br>
	from one another.<br>
5	In this embodiment, the cams 10 ate positioned and secured at opposite ends of the<br>
	elongate connecting member 20 that extends intermediate the cams 10. Member 20 and<br>
	cams 10 may be one integral homogeneous piece of material, or may be separate pieces<br>
	joined together. Some examples of techniques for connecting member 20 and cams 10<br>
	include staking, threading, screwing, bolting, or welding. Additionally, connecting<br>
10	member 20 may be configured to join cams to along their axes of rotation, or may be<br>
	configured to connect the cams at any position that transmits the rotation of one cam to the<br>
	other cam. Additionally, one or more cams 10 may be positioned at any point along central<br>
	member 20.<br>
	Variations of the embodiment described above and shewn in FIGS-1-7 ate within<br>
15	the scope of the invention. For example, one of cams 10 is shown in FIGS. 2 and 4 as<br>
	having a substantially elliptical cross sectional shape, however it is contemplated that<br>
	cams 10 could have almost any cross sectional shape mat would provide a greater distance<br>
	along a first axis than along a second axis while permitting the cam to be intentionally<br>
	turned by the surgeon. For instance, cams 10 could have an oval cross section or a cross<br>
20	section that is generally rectangular with rounded comers. It should be understood also<br>
	mat interior surfaces 31 can also assume a variety of shapes cooperating with the Shape of<br>
	the cams 10. Regardless of the specific cross sectional shape of the cams 10 and lie shape<br>
	of interior surfaces 31, implant 8 may include a retainer mechanism to secure the position<br>
	of cams 10 and thereby maintain the implant in the expanded position. For example,<br>
25	interior surfaces 31 may be adapted to hold cams 10 in a fixed position when the implant<br>
	has been transformed to flue expanded position. Inferring to FIGS. 2 and 4, for example,<br>
	retainer mechanism includes cavities 33 formed along interior surfaces 31 that are not<br>
	occupied in the non-expanded position (see FIG. 2),but mat are occupied by the cams 10<br>
	in the expanded position (see FIG. 4). For example, cavities 33 include surfaces having a<br>
30	radius of curvature less man the radius of curvature of the corresponding portion of the<br>
	surface of the cam. As such, a predetermined difference in the radius of curvatures<br><br><br>
WO2004/026188	PCT/US2003/029155<br>
11<br>
	requires a predetermined rotational force to move the cam out of the cavity. In other<br>
	embodiments, the retainer mechanism may include notches, tabs and other similar<br>
	structures to secure the cams to hold the implant in the expanded position. Thus, in the<br>
	expanded position, the portions of interior surfaces 31 feat define the cavities 33 in the<br>
5	non-expended position contact the cams 10 and resist movement of the cams 10 out of the<br>
	expanded position.<br>
		It will further be understood that exterior surfaces 32, while in one embodiment<br>
	may be substantially semi-circular in shape, as shown in FIGS. 2-7, can be provided in a<br>
	variety of other shapes. Moreover, it is contemplated that at least portions of surfaces 32<br>
10	may also include a variety of adaptations designed to secure them to the surface of a<br>
	vertebral body. The sutfaces 32 may include bumps, ridges, threads, spikes, grooves, slots<br>
	or other features to ensure that the surfaces 32 securely contact the vertebral body and do<br>
	not slip out of position.<br>
		Additionally, each of end members 30 may include a truncated outer wall 3GT<br>
15	(FIG.. 1). Truncated wall 3OT defines an access gap 38 that provides access to one of the<br>
	cams 10 from the exterior of implant 8. Cam 10 may further include a tool receptacle 21,<br>
	shown in FIGS. 3 and 5. Tool receptacle 21 can be provided in a wide variety of shapes,<br>
	including but not limited to a Phillips head shape, a flathead shape, a star shape, a hex-<br>
	wrench shape, and a square shape. The receptacle 21 facilitates the expansion of the<br>
20	implant by receiving a tool (not shown) that may be turned to cause the rotation of the<br>
	cams 10.<br>
		Additionally, implant 8 may further include an assembly connector device or<br>
	mechanism to hold end members 30 together with the cams 10 and thus prevent the<br>
	components of the implant from becoming completely separated during handling and<br>
25	insertion into the intervertebral space. The assembly connector may include any structure<br>
	that maintains a connection between the end members 30 and the cams 10. One example<br>
	is a fine wire encircling the ends and which may be permanent or biodegradable on<br>
	absorbable. If permanent, it would not be strong enough to resist the expansion feature of<br>
	the invention. In another connector example shown in FIGS. 6-7, implant 8 includes pins<br>
30	14 projecting through slots 37 in a wall 30C of each of the reflective top and bottom end<br>
	members 30. The pins are fixed in shoulders 10T of each of the cams 10. The slots 37<br><br><br>
WO2004/026188	PCT/US2003/029155<br>
12<br>
	receive the pins 14 and the pins thus retain the end members 30 about the cams 10. The<br>
	slots 37 are configured to form a path defined by the pins 14 as the cams 10 rotate. If<br>
	desired, an assembly connector device or mechanism may take the form of any shaped<br>
	protrusion and corresponding slot, or any other device or mechanism that prevents the<br>
5	cams 10 and end members 30 from, becoming completely separated during insertion or<br>
	during handling prior to insertion of the implant.<br>
		Additionally, referring to FIG. 1, implant 8 includes internal chamber ends 60,<br>
	defined by walls 30c of end members 30, elongate connecting member 20, and by adjacent<br>
	vertebral bodies 21 and 22; when the implant is inserted between the adjacent vertebral<br>
10	bodies. Chamber 60may be filled with a material that promotes bone growth. A variety<br>
	of such bone growth promoting materials may be used. For example, chamber 60 may be<br>
	packed with a material composition including an osteoinductive factor such as bone<br>
	morphgenetic protein (BMP) or L1mineralization protein (LMP). For example, BPM-<br>
	1, BMP-2 or BMP-11 might be used. Deminerlized bone matrix (DEM), bone in<br>
15	particulats form such as chips or powder might also be used. A conductive or scaffolding<br>
	material might also be used. Examples are bone, or a biocetarnic such as biocompatible<br>
	calcium phosphate ceramics. Examples of those include biphasic calcium phospate,<br>
	tricalcium phosphate, and preferably a hydroxyapatite paste material such as described in<br>
	ETEX, Corp. U.S, PatenteNos. 6331,312,6214,368, 6,117,456, and 6,027,742.<br>
20	Numerous methods.<br>
	could be used to fill chamber 60- For example a paste could be packed within chamber 60.<br>
	Another alternative is to spool a collagen sheet coated with BMP around the connecting<br>
	member 20. The sheet may have a -width substantially equivalent to the width of chamber<br>
	60 defined by end members 30. Yet another possibihty is to inject bone growth promoting<br>
25	material through the gaps 61 (FIG. 5) when the implant is in an expanded position. Also,<br>
	if two implants according to this embodiment are positioned side-by-side within disc space<br>
	"S" then space is provided for inserting bone growth promoting materials In chamber 60.<br>
		In accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention, shown in FIGS.<br>
	8-14, an expandable osteogenic fusion implant 200 includes a screw-type expansion<br>
	30 member. Implant 200 includes end members with upper endportions 230a and lower end<br>
	portions 230b, each having one or more threaded bores 231 (FIG. 11). In one version of<br><br><br>
WO2004/026188 	PCT/US2003/029155<br>
13<br>
	this second embodiment, shown in FIG. 8, elongate central members 233a and 233b<br>
	extend between and connect the upper end portions 230a and the lower end portions 2301b,<br>
	respectively, of the end members. Alternatively, in another embodiment, and refering to<br>
	FIG. 9, implant 210 includes only one elongate central member 233 extending between<br>
5	either the upper end portions 230U or the lower end portions 230L. In either case, the<br>
	elongate central members 230a, b, or member 233, if only one is to be used, may be<br>
	attached to the upper or lower end portions. Some examples of suitable attachment<br>
	methods are welding, screwing or bolting. Alternatively, end portions 230a and 230b and<br>
	the elongate central member portions 233a, b and member 233 may be manufactured as<br>
10	one piece. The implant 200 farther includes screws 250, each having screw threads 251a<br>
	and 251b and gear teeth 252 (FIGS. 10,11 and 13). Referring to FIGS. 8 and 10, there are<br>
	four of these screws although more or fewer screws may be utilized. The implant 200 also<br>
	includes central axle 220 having central axle threads 221 at each end (FIG. 8) which act as<br>
	a gear worm engaging the gear teeth 252 to turn the screws and expand the intplant<br>
15	Screw threads 251a at one end of screws 250 are left hand threaded, and screw<br>
	threads 251b at the other end of screws 250 are right hand threaded. Thus stating a screw<br>
	250 about its longitudinal axis in a first direction will cause the screw 250 to thread itself<br>
	 into threaded bore 231 of upper end member 230a and into threaded bore 231 of lower end<br>
	 member 230b. Rotating a screw 250 in a second direction opposite the first will cause<br>
20	screw 250 to thread itself out of threaded bore 231 of upper end member 230a and thread<br>
	itself out of threaded bore 231 of lower end member 230b. Alternately, each screw and<br>
	 bore may only be threaded at one end. In another embodimeut, the upper and lower end<br>
	 portions are not connected by a central portion, and the screws and bores at opposite ends<br>
	 of the implant have differently pitched threads, thereby expanding each end at a different<br>
25	rate to impart a predetermined curvature to the adjacent vertebrae.<br>
		Central axle 220 is positioned between upper end 230a and lower end 230b.<br>
	 Central axle 220 is further positioned so that central axle threads 221 contact gear teeth<br>
	 252 of each of the screws 250. This configuration forms a plurality of worm gears. When<br>
	central axle 220 is rotated about its longitudinal axis, central axle threads 221 successively<br>
30	engage gear teeth 252 of line screws 250 thus causing the screws 250 to rotate about their<br>
	longitudinal axes. Due to the fact that the screws 250 on each end of implant 200 are<br><br><br>
WO2004/026188 	PCT/US2003/029155<br>
14<br>
	positioned on opposite sides of the central axle 220, turning the central axle 220 will<br>
	cause the screws 250 to turn in opposite .directions as the central axle threads 221 engage<br>
	the gear teeth 252. Thus, the rotation of central axle 220 causes the expansion of the<br>
	implant by rotating the screws 250.<br>
5		It should be understood that screws 250 might include only one of threaded<br>
	portions 25 a and 251b. In such case, a smooth shank portion (not shown) may be<br>
	substituted for the omitted one of threaded portions 25 la and 251b, Also, one of the upper<br>
	end 230a and tower end 230b may have bores 231 that are unthreaded and that receive the<br>
	smooth shank portions. While rotation of the screws will cause displacement of the end in<br>
10	which they are threaded, such as upper end 230a, the smooth shank portions of the strews<br>
	will rotate freely in the unthreaded bores, such as in lower end 230b, and that end will not<br>
	be displaced. The resulting expansion of implant 200 is shown in FIG.13.<br>
		Additionally, implant 200 may include tool receptacle 222 at one end of central<br>
	axle 200 for receiving a tool to rotate the central axle and expand or contract the implant,<br>
15	Tool receptacle 222 may have a variety of shapes including but not limited to a hexagonal<br>
	wrench shape, a star shape, a Phillips head shape, a flathead shape, and a square shape.<br>
	The implant 200 may farther include locking cap 260 {FIG. 14) that connects to the end of<br>
	the implant having tool receptacle 222 to prevent rotation of central axle 222. In one<br>
	embodiment, locking cap 260 has an inside face 260a having a post 262 adapted to fit into<br>
20	turning tool receptacle 222. Locking cap 260 further includes screw holes 261 to receive<br>
	screws 230a inserted from the outside face and screwed into screw holes 230c and 230d<br>
	after the desired expansion has been established. Thus, locking cap 260 is capable of<br>
	preventing central axle 220 from rotating about its longitudinal axis by engaging post 262<br>
	with turning tool receptacle 222 and by further engaging the engaging screws with upper<br>
25	end member 230a and lower end member 230b by passing them through screw holts 261<br>
	and threading them into upper end member 230a and lower end member 230b. Other<br>
	devices, such as pins, rivets or posts could be substituted for screws.<br>
		In operation, since the central axle 220 drives screws 250 on opposite sides (i.e. the<br>
	left and right sides as viewed in FIGS. 10 and 11) of central axle 220, the screws are<br>
30	threaded into threaded bores 231 of common upper end member 230 in opposite<br>
	directions. Thus the screws 250 on opposite sides of the central axle 220 would turn in<br><br><br>
WO2004/026188 	PCT/US2003/029155<br>
15<br>
	opposite directions. So when axle 220 is rotated, the screws are simultaneously either<br>
	threading into or out of the bores 2311 depending on the direction of shaft rotation. So<br>
	they simultaneously move the member 230a in the same direction relative to the screws.<br>
	As stated above, the threads on opposite ends of each screw rosy be oppositely threaded.<br>
5	So screws 250 are threaded into threaded bores 231 of the common lower end member<br>
	230b in the direction opposite that in the common upper end member. Thus both ends of<br>
	the screws 250 accomplish, the same movement relative to the upper and lower end, either<br>
	threading into or out of the bores 231.<br>
	In accordance with a third embodiment, referring to FIGS. 15-18, an expandable<br>
10	osteogenic fusion implant 300 includes a rack-and-piman type expansion member.<br>
	implant 300 includes upper end 330a and lower end 330b, having corresponding bones<br>
	331. Elongate central portions 333a and 333b extend between and connect the respective<br>
	upper end portions 330a and the lower end portions 330b. Alternatively, only one<br>
	elongate central member 333 may be included extending between either the upper end<br>
15	portions 330a or the lower end portions 330b. In either case, the elongate central member<br>
	may be permanently or removably attached to the end portions 330a and/or 330b, such as<br>
	by welding, screwing or bolting. Alternatively, the end portions 330a and 330b and the<br>
	elongate member 333 may be formed aa one piece. The implant 300 further includes gear<br>
	racks 350, having tack teeth 351, disposed within each bore 331. The implant 300 also<br>
20	includes central axle 320 having central axle gear teeth 321 corresponding with rack teeth<br>
	1351. Gear teeth 321 may be disposed directly on central axis 320 or, alternatively, maybe<br>
	disposed on a separate pinion gear that is adapted to fit around the axle.<br>
		In operation, rack teeth 351 of one rack 350 contact the gear teeth 321 on one side<br>
	of the central axle 320, Stack teeth 351 of another rack 350 contact the gear teeth 321 on<br>
25	the other side of the central axle 320. This configuration, forms a plurality of racks and<br>
	pinions. Central axle 320 is positioned intermediate upper end 330a and lower end 330b.<br>
	When central axle 320 is rotated about its longitudinal axis, central gear teeih 321<br>
	successively engage teeth 351 of the racks 350 thus cause the racks 350 to be displaced.<br>
	Due to the fact that the racks 350 are positioned on opposite sides of the central axle 320,<br>
	30 rotation of the central axle 320 will cause the racks 350 to be displaced m opposite<br>
	directions when the gear teeth 321 engage the respective tack teeth 351. Thus when<br><br><br>
WO2004/026188	PCT/US2003/029155<br>
16<br>
	adjacent racks 350 are displaced, one of them will come into contact with the end of bore<br>
	331 in upper end member 330a and the other will come into contact with the end of bore<br>
	331 in lower end member 330b. When the racks contact bore ends in 330a and 330b, they<br>
	will exert forces upon them. The force exerted upon the upper end member 330a will be<br>
5	in a first direction and the force exerted upon the lower end member 330b will be in a<br>
	second opposite direction. Due to the opposing nature of these forces, rotating central axle<br>
	320 will cause the expansion of the implant 300, m another embodiment similar to .<br>
	implant 300, referring to FIG.. 18, an implant 300 may further include springs 370,<br>
	disposed in bores 331. Springs 370 contact racks 350 and tore* 331 and exert a force<br>
10	upon racks 350 to assist in the expansion of the implant. Springs could be added to<br>
	implants 200 and 210 {FIGS.8-13), if desired.<br>
		Further, referring to FIG. 16, central axle 320 includes a tool receptacle 322 at one<br>
	end. Tool socket 322 may be provided in a variety of shapes including, but not limited to<br>
	a hexagonal wrench shape, a star shape, a Phillips head shape, a flathead shape, and a<br>
15	square shape. Rotation of the central axle 320 may be accomplished by inserting the tool<br>
	into the tool receptacle 322 and rotating the tool A T-handled Allen wrench is one<br>
	example of a tool. The implant may further include a locking cap 260, as shown in FIG.<br>
	14 and functioning as described above, including a post 262 adapted to fit into turning tool<br>
	receptacle 322,<br>
20	Additionally, implant 300 may include ratcheting mechanisms 389 (FIG. 17)<br>
	disposed in recess 380 formed in bores 331 of upper end 330a and lower end 330b.<br>
	Suitable ratcheting mechanisms 389 include, for example, axles 390 and engaging bodies<br>
	391. Recesses 380 allow the engaging bodies 391 to pivot in a first direction, but to<br>
	prevent pivoting past a certain position in a second opposite direction. Engaging bodies<br>
25	391 are shaped to fit between and engage the rack teeth 351 (FIG. 17)- When racks 350<br>
	are displaced in a first direction, rack teeth 351 exert a force on engaging bodies 391 and<br>
	cause them to pivot in a first direction and move partially into recesses 380, and then the<br>
	bodies pivot back into the next successive space between the teeth as the rack is further<br>
	displaced. In their original position, the bodies 391 contact one side of recesses 380,<br>
30	thereby preventing pivoting of the bodies in that direction. When engaging bodies 391<br>
	can no longer pivot and are positioned intermediate the rack teeth 351, the rack 350 is<br><br><br>
WO 2004/026188 	PCT7US2OO3/029155<br>
17<br>
	prevented from moving further in the second direction. In this manner, the implant may<br>
	be ratcheted open. Additionally, a biasing member such as a spring may be used to force<br>
	the body in the non-pivoting position. Other ratcheting mechanisms could be substituted<br>
	for ratcheting mechanisms 389. For example, mechanisms that do not pivot, but flex.<br>
5	could be used.<br>
		In another embodiment of the invention, variations include biasing-type expansion<br>
	members. Referring specifically to FIGS. 20-24, implant 400 includes upper and lower<br>
	end 430a and 430b having cavities 451 a and 451b. Elongate central member 433 extends<br>
	between lower ends 430b. Alternatively, elongate central member 433 may extend<br>
10	between the upper ends 430a. In another alternative, an upper and a lower elongate central<br>
	member may extend, respectively, between the upper end member 430a and the lower end<br>
	member 430b. In any case, the elongate central member 433 may be fisably or removably<br>
	attached to the end 430a and/or 430b, such as welding, screwing or bolting. Alternatively,<br>
	the end and the elongate member may be fanned as one piece.<br>
15	The expandable osteogenic fusion implant 400 further includes bodies 450 having<br>
	upper surfaces 451 a and lower surfaces 45 1b abutting the ends of the bores in each end<br>
	430a and 430b. The bodies 450 are made of a material that is capable of assuming<br>
	multiple shapes. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that a wide variety of<br>
	materials and structures may be used to construct bodies 450. For example, bodies 450<br>
20	may be made of a shape memory alloy. In this case the bodies 450 could be designed to<br>
	change shape or, alternatively, to expand when subjected to specific environmental<br>
	conditions, such as heating or cooling the implant. The implant 400 of FIGS. 20-24 have a<br>
	single body in each end member, while PIG. 25 shows how two bodies could be used in an<br>
	end member. Phase change expansion of a few millimeters may be achieved.<br>
25		Bodies 450 may be compressible bodies. Some examples are a polymer or other<br>
	elastomer or a spring. Suitable examples of a spring includes coil springs, leaf springs,<br>
	springs made of shape memory alloy and any other spring-like member. In these cases, an<br>
	external force applied to the bodies (as by a tool) causes the bodies 450 to assume a<br>
	compressed state, and the bodies 450 could then be held in that state until the implant is<br>
30	inserted into the desired surgical position. At that time the force compressing the bodies<br>
	450 could be released or reduced and the bodies could reassume a relaxed state, thereby<br><br><br>
WO 2004/026188 	PCT7US2OO3/029155<br>
18<br>
	expanding the implant by a predetermined amount The variation 420 shown in FIG. 19 is<br>
	an example \isiflg coil springs 450c as the compressible body.<br>
		In the FIG.. 25 variation, implant 410 may include multiple bodies 450 of either a<br>
	phase change type of material or a compressible body disposed within the ends 410a and<br>
5	410b to cause expansion of the implant<br>
		It is of note that, when viewed along their longitudinal axes, line implants described<br>
	above are circular. Their ends have a short cylindrical shape.<br>
		Referring now to FIGS., 26-50, the reference numerals used for implant<br>
	components having functions similar to or identical to those described above with<br>
10	reference to FIGS. 1-25, are as used in FIGS. 1-25 but with the letter R in front of them.<br>
	These implants, when viewed along their longitudinal axes, are rectangular. Their ends<br>
	have the shape of a short parallelepiped<br>
		A set of barbs 510 is provided on each of the end members R30 so that, after<br>
	pushing or impacting the implant in the direction of arrow 520 into the intervertebral<br>
15	space, there will be added resistance to movement in the opposite direction out of the<br>
	space. These barbs can be provided on the top surface and bottom surface such as shown<br>
	at the top and bottom in FIGS. 26,27,29,31,, and 32, extending entirely across the<br>
	implant They can also be provided in other shapes, numbers and in multiples across one<br>
	row with various spacings, as desired They are not shown In FIGS. 28 and 30 in order to<br>
20	avoid congestion in the illustration where the intent is to show, in FIG. 28, slight spacing<br>
	between the vertebral endplates and the top and bottom of the end members R30, and to<br>
	show in FIG. 30 the closure of the space between the end members and the vertebra! plates<br>
	as the implant has been expanded. Batbs are also shown on the lop and bottom faces of<br>
	the end members of variation R210 in FIG. 34. As indicated above, barbs can be omitted<br>
25	from one or both end members of these and the other embodiments, if desired. This can<br>
	be observed in FIGS. 33, 35-38, 40,41, and 43-50, for example.<br>
		In the various embodiments of RG5. 1-25, the end can be externally screw<br>
	threaded as shown, at 65 for example in FIG. 1, so that they can be screwed into the<br>
	intervertebral disc space, if desired. Even without threads, they can be simply pushed or<br>
30	impacted into the space. The embodiments of FIGS. 26-50 can be pushed or impacted into<br>
	the space regardless of whether they are provided without barbs or with barbs such as<br><br><br>
WO2004/026188 	PCT/US2003/029155<br>
19<br>
	shown in FIG.- 26 for additional anchorage. But due to the feet that the implants are<br>
	expandable, they can be made small enough that they can be inserted into the<br>
	intervertebral space without impacting them and then they can be expanded to maintain<br>
	the desired spacing of the plates of the adjacent vertebral bodies, according to the present<br>
5	invention.<br>
		While the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and<br>
	foregoing description, the same is to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive in<br>
