				<td>This  invention  relates  to  an device   for<br><br>
controlling  pollution and noise caused  by  motor  vehicles  and generator sets.<br>
The problem of pollution is a great problem in our country. The efforts are being made to reduce pollution caused by motor vehicles generator sets etc.<br><br>
There are devices known in the prior art for reducing The chemical pollutant like carbon mono oxide etc. produced by the vehicles but no device is as such known for controlling the pollution caused by the suspended<br>
particulate  matter (SPM) present in the exhaust of  the<br>
motor vehicles as well as generating sets.  Further,  no<br>
device except silencer is as such known for reducing the noise pollution caused by the motor vehicle as well as generator sets.<br>
Therefore, the main object of this invention is to propose a device for controlling pollution caused by the suspended particulate matter present in the exhaust/smoke of the vehicles and generator sets.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a device for controlling the pollution caused by the suspended particulate mattery as well as noise of the vehicles and generator sets.<br>
According to this invention there is provided at device for controlling pollution caused by the suspended particulate matter and noise of the vehicle comprising a housing consisting of top and bottom half portions adapted to be secured with each other, an inlet  being provided near the top end of said top half and an outlet being provided in said top half at the opposite sides thereof, a filtering elements being secured at the bottom end of said top half, a reinforcement having a reinforcement plate being provided in the middle of said lower half, brackets being provided at the inlet as well as outlet port for securing the device with the chassis of the vehicle.<br>
In accordance with this invention the device for controlling the pollution caused by the suspended<br><br>
particulate matter as well as noise of the vehicles and generator sets has  a  housing having top and lower half  portions  thereof. Said  top  and  lower half portions are  adapted  to  be secured  with each other by means of three toggle clamps.  A partition is provided in the said top half portion of the housing so as to divide the same into upper and lower chambers. A filtering element is provided at the bottom end of the lower chamber of said top half by means of a flange and gasket.  An inlet, is provided  in one  side  of  the upper chamber of said  top  half  for  allowing the insertion  and it is supported by the partition provided in the top half.  An outlet pipe is provided in the other side of the upper chamber of said top half for holding an exhaust pipe therewith. The bottom half of the housing comprises upper and lower chambers adapted to be secured with each other by welding or other securing means. A reinforcement plate having a plurality of holes is secured at the bottom end of the upper portion of said lower half for supporting a reinforcement thereon having a plurality of holes in flow communication with the holes of reinforcement plate. Clamps are provided<br>
with the inlet as well as the outlet pipes for securing the device with the chassis of the vehicle.<br>
A device for controlling pollution according to a preferred embodiment is herein described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein:<br><br>
Fig.   1	shows  the sectional    view of  the ride elevation device<br>
'Fig. 2    shows filtering elements;  and<br>
Fig. 3     shows reinforcement plate.<br>
Referring to the drawings particularly fig. 1 the pollution control device comprises a housing CD consisting of top and bottom halves (2) and (3) adapted to be secured with each other by means of toggle clamps 3A. A partition (4) is disposed within the top half â‚¬2) so as to provide upper and lower portion (5) and (6) in<br>
the  top  half  (2).  The  partition  (4)  supports  the<br>
exhaust  inlet pipe (8) therein.  An inlet port  (7)  is<br>
provided at one side of the upper portion 5 of the top half (2) for facilitating the insertion of the exhaust inlet pipe (8) for conveying the exhaust of the engine<br><br>
to the lower half (3) of the housing 1.  An outlet pipe<br>
(9)  is provided  at the opposite sides of  the  upper<br>
portion (5) of the top half (2) for securing an  exhaust<br>
pipe or tail pipe  (10) therewith.  A filtering element<br>
(11)  is secured at the bottom end of the lower  portion<br>
(6)   of  the  top  half  (2)  by means  of   securing<br>
arrangement.   The  securing  arrangement  comprises   a<br>
flange  and gasket (12) and (13) for holding the  filter<br>
element  (11) (fig. 2) therein.  The bottom half (3)  of<br>
the housing (1) also comprises upper and lower  portions<br>
(14)  and  (15).  A reinforcement plate  (16)  (fig.  3)<br>
having  a  plurality of holes (17) is  secured  with  a<br>
reinforcement base (18) secured with the bottom end of<br>
the upper portion (14) of the lower half (3) of the housing (1). The reinforcement base (18) has a<br><br>
plurality of holes (17) in flow communication with the holes (17) provided in the reinforcement plate (16). The partition 4 and the reinforcement base 18 are provided to reduce the noise. A central hole (19) is provided in the filter element (11) for allowing the passage of the exhaust inlet pipe (8) there through for conveying the exhaust to the lower portion (15) of the lower half (3) of the housing (1). The filter element is provided to filter the SPM from the exhaust smoke of the engine. Clamps (20) and (21) are provided with the<br><br>
inlet pipe as well as outlet pipe respectively for securing the device with the chassis of the vehicle. Clamps (22) and (23) are provided to<br>
secure  the exhaust inlet pipe  of the engine  with  the<br>
inlet pipe  and  the exhaust/tail pipe  (10)  with  the<br>
outlet port (9) respectively.<br>
As shown in fig. 2, the filter element comprises a circular frame (24) for supporting a filter element (11) made of very fine wiremesh. The wirmesh is made of very thin copper wires so as to filter the suspended particulate matter even of very fine size present in the exhaust/smoke of the engine.<br><br><br><br><br>
