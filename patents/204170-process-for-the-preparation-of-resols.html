COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br><br><br>
"PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF RESOLS"<br><br>
BAKELITE AG, of Gennaer Str. 2-4, D-58642 Iserlohn-Letmathe, Germany,<br><br>
GANTED<br>
2/9/2004<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br><br>
The invention relates to process for the preparation of resols and more particularly to the preparation of phenolic resins prepared with the aid of metal salts which catalyze the formation of resols and whose cations can easily be precipitated as low-solubility salts in industrial processes.<br>
Resols of this type are preferred for various areas of application owing to their better moisture resistance.<br>
Examples of basic salts of this type are basic alkaline earth metal salts, in particular calcium hydroxide. These salts have the advantage over the alkali metal hydroxides usually employed that the resins prepared in this way have a very low content of free phenol and that the products produced from these resins have better moisture resistance. After the condensation, the salts can be precipitated from the aqueous solution by addition of dilute sulphuric acid, carbon dioxide, ammonium sulphate, ammonium phosphates or ammonium carbonates and separated off. This gives resins which are virtually ash-free.<br>
It is a disadvantage of these resins that the insoluble precipitates formed in their preparation must be filtered off in a complex process, since otherwise blockage of the nozzles can' occur during processing of the resins by spraying and can thus result in problems during processing.<br>
Filtration of the resins is firstly complex and secondly associated with considerable loss of resins. In addition, disposal of filter cakes containing phenolic resins to landfill is expensive and represents an environmental problem.<br>
A solution to these problems are phenolic resins in which calcium ions are bound to. the resins in the form of complexes with the aid of ammonia or amines,  as<br><br>
disclosed in EP-A 0 198 130 and EP-A 0 190 468. However, these complexes have only moderate stability. Within a few hours, precipitates form in the corresponding resin solution, and consequently these resins can only be employed if they are processed further immediately' after the  complexing. This is generally not the case, since the resin manufacturer is not the processor.<br>
In addition, it has been found that calcium carbonate present in technical-grade calcium hydroxide likewise interferes with the processing of these resins and promotes further precipitations.<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to provide resols which are simple to prepare and which give products having good moisture resistance. ' It is 'a further object of the invention that these resols have no interfering precipitations on neutralization with the usual neutralizing agents used, such as sulphuric acid, carbon dioxide, ammonium sulphate, ammonium phosphates or ammonium carbonate,  and in which impurities of industrial products, such as for example, calcium carbonate, have no  interfering effects.<br>
The object is achieved by a process according to Claims 1 to 6. The resins prepared using the process according to the invention are used, in particular, as binders for the production of acoustic and thermal insulating materials, wood materials, foams and laminates according to Claims 7 to 10. <br><br>
Accordingly, there is provided process for the preparation of resols by reacting phenolic compounds with aldehydes with catalysis, by metal salts whose cations can easily be precipitated as low-solubility salts in industrial processes, wherein a dispersant of the kind such as herein described is added to the reaction mixture comprising phenolic compound, aldehyde and metal salt before, during or after the condensation reaction, and a complexing agent of the kind such as herein described is admixed after the condensation reaction is complete and after the dispersant has been admixed.<br>
In phenolic resins condensed with the aid of alkaline earth metal ions, it has been attempted to keep the alkaline earth metal ions in solution with the aid of complexing agents in such a way that a good self life is achieved. This was not successful. As a corresponding comparative example shows, addition of<br><br>
conventional complexing agents to a resin solution prepared with the aid of alkaline earth metal ions did not' result in the desired effect of complexing of the metal ions.<br>
EP-A 890 613 teaches to mix a urea-modified phenolic reein which has been condensed with the aid of alkaline earth metal hydroxide with a chelating agent and a polymeric anionic diepersant after the condensation reaction in a single working step. On repeating this teaching (Example 7), however, it was found that a precipitate is nevertheless formed and must be filtered off. In addition, the products obtained have a dark colour, which restricts their use in all cases where a pale hue is desired, such as, for exampls, on use in the mineral wool industry.<br>
Surprisingly, however, it has been found that mixing of the resin solution of a phenolic resin prepared with the aid of alkaline earth metal hydroxide with a commercially available complexing agent allows complexing o:: the metal ions to be achieved if the resin solution has already been intensively mixed with a diepersant.. The resin here is clearly in dispersed form. The resin solution formed in this way is stable. No precipitate forms  Even on contact with CO2 or even on passing CO2 into corresponding solutions, no alkaline earth metal carbonate precipitates. On the contrary, alkaline earth metal carbonate particles present in the resin solution dissolved within a short time.<br>
It is furthermore surprising that the metal ions in the resins treated in this way are immobilized in such a way that they are apparently no longer available for later reactions with water. The products produced using the resins prepared in accordance with the invention are distinguished by very good moisture resistance.<br><br>
The condensation reaction of phenolic compounds is carried out in the manner known per as for the preparation of resols by heating the reactants in aqueous solution until the desired degree of condensation has been achieved. The condensation partners employed can be any phenolic compounds and aldehydes known for the preparation of pher.olic resins.<br>
Phenolic compounds are, in particular, phenol, but also aliphatically or aromatically substituted phenols, and polyhydric phenols. Examples of these are cresols, xylenols, tert-octylphenol, naphthols, p-phenylphenol, bisphenols and resorcinols, but also natural products, such as, for example, cardenol, cardol and tannin. The phenolic compounds can be employed as individual compounds or in any desired mixtures with one another.<br>
Aldehydes which can be employed are all compounds of the general formula R-CHO. Examples are formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, n-butyraldehyde and aeobutryraldehyde, glyoxal and furfural. The preferred aldehyde is formaldehyde, which is employed as such or in the form of a formaldehyde-eliminatir.g substance, such as, for example, paraformaldehyde or srioxane. The preferred form of addition is an aqueous solution having a formaldehyde content of greater than 3 0% (formalin). The molar ratio between phenolic compound and aldehyde can be selected as desired in the range<br>
from 1 : 1.2 to 1 : 4.<br>
Catalysts which can I.e employed in the process according to the invention are metal salts which catalyze the formation of resols and whose cations can easily be precipitated as low-solubility salts in industrial processes. Examples are magnesium oxide, magnesium hydroxide, the hydroxides of the alkaline earth metals calcium, strontium and barium, and salts thereof with weak acids, but also weakly basic salts of the transition metals,  such as,  for example,  zinc<br><br>
acetate and manganese octanoate. The preferred catalyst is calcium hydroxide.<br>
The amount of catalyst employed is in the range from 1 to 15% by weight, preferably in the range from 2 to 6% by weight, based on the amount of phenolic compound employed.<br>
The disperssants employed can be any commercially availahle substances which are marketed as dispersants, emulsifiers, wetting agents or anti-deposition agents for aqueous systems. Examples are ammonium acrylatea, phosphonium salts, polyalkoxy compounds, such as, for example, alkylarylpolyethylene glycols, salts of fatty acids, in particular of alkylarylcarboxylic acids, alkylbenzenesulphonates, alkylnaphthalenesulphonates or sulphonates of products of the condensation of naphthalene or alkylnaphthalene with formaldehyde, alkyl sulphates or betaines. Preference is given to ammonium polyacrylates or alkylnaphthalenesulphonates.<br>
In an amount of from 0.05 to 5%, based on the phenolic compound employed, they are added to the reaction mixture comprising phenolic compounds, aldehyde and catalyst and mixed intensively. They can be added either before, during or after the condensation reaction. In the latter case, the dispersant can be added to the reaction mixture before the neutralization or thereafter. The crucial factor in all cases is that the resin is in some type of dispersed form, with the aid of the added dispersant, before addition of the chelating agent. This generally requires intensive mixing of the; reaction mixture with the dispersant for several minutes, at least 10 minutes in customary stirred reactors used in the preparation of the resins, before the complexing agent is added.<br>
Complexing agents which can be employed a:re all water-soluble compounds known per se which form chelates with<br><br>
metal ions. Examples are ketocarboxylic acids, dimethylglyoxime, aminopolycarboxylic acids, diethylenetriiaminepentaacetic acid, but in particular nitrilotriaceric acid (NTA) and ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA). <br>
They are preferably employed in an amount which is stoichiometrically sufficient to complex the metal ions of the catalysts employed, an excess of up to 10% preferably being selected in order to achieve a satisfactory complexing rate. A further excess does no harm, but is inappropriate for economic reasons. However, addition of a slightly sub-stoichiometric amount of complexing agent also results in transparent resin solutions.<br>
The complexirg agent is added after the condensation reaction is complete artd after the freshly prepared resin solution has been mixed with the dispersant. The complexing agent can likewise be added to the resin solution either before or after neutralization of the reaction mixture.<br>
If the complexing agent is added before the neutralization, precipitations do not form even on neutralization with acids which per se lead to low-solubility precipitations of the corresponding metal salts.<br>
If the complexing agent is added after neutralization with an acid which has already led to precipitation, this precipitation dissolves within a short time, and an infinitely water-dilutable resin solution forms. Likewise, low-solubility salts present in the resin solution, which are in the form of impurities in the technical-grade qualities employed of the metal salts used as catalyst, dissolve after a short time.<br>
These resin solutions have a shelf life: of several<br><br>
weeks without any precipitations of ins;oluble metal salts appearing. They can thus be processed in common processes, accordingly also in spray processes, even after extended storage and transport times, without the fear of precipitating salts resulting in blockage of the nozzles.<br>
The resin solutions are transparent and exhibit excellent impregnation behaviour. They can be cured in the conventional manner for standard resors, i.e. they are self-curing on exposure to heat, but can also be employed in combination with curing agents known per ae, in particular with acidB. They can likewise, as is also known of standard resols, be combined with other, preferably water-soluble, thermosetting and thermo plastic resins. Owing to these properties, they are particularly suitable for the production of laminates and foams.<br>
The cured resins exhibit excellent mechanical strengths and very good moisture resistance. They are therefore preferably suitable for the production of acoustic and thermal insulating materials and wood materials.<br>
Examples<br>
The amounts given in the Examples are in each case parte by weight (pbw). The dispersant employed in Examples 1 and 5 is an ammonium polyacrylate (Nopcosperse ) . The dispersant employed in Example 2 is diieobutylnaphthalenesulphonate (Nekal® BX) .<br>
Example 1<br>
100 pbw of phenol are mixed in a reactor with 50 pbw of water and 4 pbw of slaked lime and heated to 70°C. 237.5 pbw/ of 45% formalin solution are then added, and the reaction mixture is condensed at 70°C to a water dilutability of l : 10. 62.7 pbw of urea are then<br><br>
added, followed by 0.5 pbw of dispersant.<br>
After the reaction mixture has been stirred for 2 hours and cooled, 1 pbw of complexing agent (Na salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is added, and the mixture is stirred for a further 15 minutes.<br>
The reaction mixture is then neutralized to pH 7 using dilute sulphuric acid. The reaction solution remains clear. No precipitations are observed. Even after a storage time of 4 weeks at room temperature, no precipitations are observed.<br>
Example 2<br>
100 pbw of phenol are mixed in a reactor with 50 pbw of water and 5 pbw of slaked lime and heated to 70°C. 237 pbw of 45% formalin solution are then added, and the reaction mixture is condensed at 70°C to a water dilutability of 1 : 10.<br>
After the mixture haB been cooled to 23°C, 2 pbw of a 50% strength aqueous solution of Nekal® BX are added as dispersant, and the mixture is stirred vigorously for 30 minutes. 10 pbw of a i0% strength aqueous solution of the Na salt of nitrilotriacetic acid are then added, and the mixture is homogenized.<br>
The reaction mixture is then neutralized to pH 7 using dilute sulphuric acid. The reaction solution remains clear. Even after 4 weeks (storage at room tempera¬ture) , no precipitations are observed.<br>
Example 3 (comparative example)<br>
Example 1 is repeated, the only change being that no dispersant is added.<br>
On  neutralization  of  the  reaction  mixture  using<br><br>
aulphuric acid, calcium sulphate deposits in the form of a microcrystalline precipitate.<br>
Example 4 (comparative example)<br>
Analogously to Example 1,100 pbw of phenol and 250 pbw of 45% formalin are condensed with one another at 70° in a reactor. The catalyst employed is 6.7 pbw of 50% strength sodium hydroxide solution. After the condensation, 15 pbw of urea are added to the reaction mixture, and the mixture is subsequently neutralized using dilute sulphuric acid.<br>
Example 5 (comparative example)<br>
Analogously to Example 4, 100 pbw of phenol and 210 pbw of 45% formalin are condensed with one another. The catalyst employed is 7.5 pbw of triethylamine. After the condensation, 75.8 pbw of urea are added to the reaction mixture, and the mixture is subsequently neutralized using dilute sulphuric acid.<br>
Test resultB for the resins from Examples 1-5<br>
The resins are analyzed in a conventional manner. In addition, the flexural strength of corresponding test bars is determined. In order to produce the test bars, each of the resin solutions is adjusted to a solids content of 40%. 10 pbw portions of these solutions are each mixed with 10 0 pbw of quartz sand, and the mixture is introduced into moulds (170 x 22 x 22 nm) and cured in these moulds for 2 hours at 180°C in the oven. The flexural strength is tested:<br>
a.	in the dry state<br>
b.	in the wet state after storage for 6 hours in<br>
water at 100°C and cooling for 1 hour in<br>
running water at a maximum of 20°C.<br>
The results obtained are shown in TableB 1 and 2 below:<br><br><br>
Example 6<br>
Analogously to Example l, 100 pbw of phenol are condensed with 142 pbw of 45% formalin. The catalyst U9ed is 5 pbw of barium hydroxide. After the condensation, 0.5 pbw of dispersant is added, and the reaction mixture xs stirred for 2 hours. 1&amp; 2 pbw of the Na salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid are then added, and the mixture is stirred for 5. further 3 0 minutes. 0.5 pbw of alkylsulphonic acid, 5 pbw of pentane and 5 pbw of p-toluenesulphonic acid are subsequently added, and the mixture is foamed at 60°C. The compressive strength of the foam is determined by<br><br><br>
the Chatillon method. The result is given i.n Table 3.<br>
Example 7 (comparative example)<br>
A resin is prepared analogously to Example; 6, the only change being that no dispersant is added. On addition to the mixture to be foamed, an insoluble: barium salt of p-toluenesulphonic acid precipitates out and slowly deposits in the reaction mixture. The resultant foam is thus inhomogeneous.<br>
Table 3 (compressive strength of the foams [Pa])<br>
Example 5     70 Example 6     56<br>
Example B (comparative example)<br>
100 pbw of phenol are mixed with 27.3 pbw of water and 8.8 pbw of slaked lime in a reactor and heated to 70°C. 227 pbw of 45% formalin solution are then added, and the reaction mixture is condensed at 7 0°C to a water dilutability of 1:10. After the mixture has been cooled to 60°C, 32 pbw of water and 54.7 pbw of urea are added. The mixture is then immediately cooled to 45 °C and held at this temperature for 3 0 minutes.<br>
After the mixture has been cooled to 23°C, 0.5% APBT (1% Bayhibit ® AM 50%) and 0.15% sodium ligninsulphonate (Vanisperse® CB) are added shortly one after the other<br>
with vigorous stirring.<br>
