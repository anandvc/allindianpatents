				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a novel process for preparing N-methyl-N-[(lS)-1-<br>
phenyl-2-((3S)-3- hydroxypyrrolidin-1-yl) ethyl]-2, 2-di-phenylacetamide or N-<br>
methyl-N-[(lR)-1-phenyl-2-((3R)-3-hydroxypyrrolidin-1-yl)ethyl]-2,2-<br>
diphenylacetamide, and the novel compounds N-methyl-N-[(lS)-1-phenyl-2-<br>
((3S)-3-hydroxypyrrolidin-1-yl) ethane] and N-methyl-N-[(lR)-1-phenyl-2-((3R)-<br>
3-hydroxypyrrolidin-1-yl)-ethane], which are formed as intermediates in this<br>
process.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
As described by Barber et al. (BJ. Pharmacol. (1994), 113, 1317-1327), both the<br>
compound N-methyl-N-[(lS)-1-phenyl-2-(3S)-3-hydroxypyrrolidin-1-yl) ethyl]-<br>
2,2-diphenylacetamide and its physiologically tolerable salts have valuable<br>
pharmacological properties such as an analgesic, anti-inflammatory and<br>
aquaretic action, so that they are particularly suitable for the production of<br>
medicaments.<br><br>
It has been found, as described in the Patent Application DE 1 95 23 502 or EP<br>
752 246, that this compound is a particularly efficacious compound which is<br>
suitable as a medicament for the treatment of inflammatory intestinal disorders<br>
in a very particular manner. In particular, this compound is employable and<br>
efficacious in this indication, since it simultaneously alleviates the pain associated<br>
with this disorder and, in the acute case of an intestinal occlusion threatening or<br>
produced due to the inflammatory intestinal disorder, again normalizes or sets in<br>
motion the motor response of the intestine without producing noticeable side<br>
effects. Moreover, the compound can be employed in non-inflammatory intestinal<br>
disorders such as IBS (irritable bowel syndrome).<br><br>
The Patent Applications DE 40 34 785 Al and DE<br>
42 15 213 Al or EP 0 569 802 Al describe the<br>
preparation of N-methyl-N-[(1S)-1-phenyl-2-((3S)-3-<br>
hydroxypyrrolidin-1-yl)ethyl]-2, 2-diphenylacetamide by<br>
reaction of (2S)-2-N-carboxyethyl-2-phenylglycin-<br>
N,N-[(3S)-3-hydroxytetramethylamide with diphenylacetyl<br>
chloride. As described in DE 42 15 213, the starting<br>
compound (2S)-2-N-carboxyethyl-2-phenylglycin-N,N-<br>
[(3S)-3-hydroxytetramethyleneamide, also known as (1S)-<br>
[1-N-methylamino-1-phenyl-2-{(3S)-3-hydroxypyrrol-<br>
idino)ethane can be prepared by reacting (1S)-1-amino-<br>
l-phenyl-2-chloroethane with (3S)-3-hydroxypyrrolidine<br>
and then methylating with methyl iodide. The problems<br>
of this preparation method, however, are the solubility<br>
of the starting products and that following the<br>
synthesis the racemic product mixture obtained, which<br>
is contaminated by by-products, has to be laboriously<br>
separated. The process known until now for the<br>
preparation of N-methyl-N-[(1S)-1-phenyl-2-((3S)-3-<br>
hydroxypyrrolidin-1-yl)ethyl]-2,2-diphenylacetamide is<br>
therefore laborious and expensive and results in low<br>
yields based on the starting compounds employed.<br>
It was therefore the object of the present<br>
invention to make available a process, which can be<br>
carried out in a simple manner and economically, for<br>
the preparation of N-methyl-N-[(1S)-1-phenyl-2-((3S)-3-<br>
hydroxypyrrolidin-1-yl)ethyl]-2,2-diphenylacetamide or,<br>
when using the enantiomeric starting materials, of N-<br>
methyl-N-[(1R)-1-phenyl-2-((3R)-3-hydroxypyrrolidin-1-<br>
yl)ethyl]-2,2-diphenylacetamide, which starts from<br>
economical, readily soluble starting materials which<br>
result in a product which is as enantiomerically pure<br>
as possible, which can then be isolated and purified in<br>
a simple manner.<br>
The object is achieved by a process according<br>
to Claim 1, either the previously unknown compound N-<br>
methyl-N-[(1S)-1-phenyl-2-((3S)-3-hydroxypyrrolidin-1-<br>
yl)ethane] being used as a novel intermediate for the<br>
preparation of N-methyl-N-[(1S)-1-phenyl-2-((3S)-3-<br><br>
hydroxypyrrolidin-1-yl)ethyl]-2,2-diphenylacetamide or<br>
N-methyl-N-[(1R)-1-phenyl-2-((3R)-3-hydroxypyrrolidin-<br>
1-yl)ethane] being used as a novel intermediate for the<br>
preparation of N-methyl-N-[(1R)-1-phenyl-2-((3R)-3-<br>
hydroxypyrrolidin-1-yl)ethyl]-2,2-diphenylacetamide.<br>
It has been found that compounds of the formula<br>
(III)<br><br>
in which R and R2 have the following meanings,<br>
R is H, OR1 or SR1,<br>
R1 is A, aryl, heteroaryl,- Si(R3)3 or COR3,<br>
R2 is H, A, aryl, heteroaryl and Si(R3)3 or COR3,<br>
R3 is H, A, aryl or heteroaryl,<br>
A is a straight-chain or branched alkyl radical<br>
having 1 to 6 C atoms,<br>
can be prepared in high yields and in enantiomerically<br>
pure form by amidically coupling, depending on the<br>
final product desired, (3S)-3-hydroxypyrrolidines or<br>
(3R)-3-hydroxypyrrolidines of the formula (II)<br><br>
in which<br>
R2 is H, A, aryl, heteroaryl and Si(R3)3 or COR3<br>
and<br>
R3 is H, A, aryl or heteroaryl<br>
or their salts, formed with HCl, HBr, HI, H2SO4, H3PO4<br>
or suitable organic acids,<br>
with appropriate (S)- or (R)-enantiomeric forms of N-<br>
substituted phenylglycines of the formula (I)<br><br><br><br>
in which<br>
R is H, OR1 or SR1,<br>
R1 is A, aryl, heteroaryl, Si(R3)3 or COR3,<br>
R3 is H, A, aryl or heteroaryl,<br>
M is H or a cation from the group consisting of<br>
alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, ammonium or<br>
alkylammonium.<br><br>
Alkyl has 1 to 6, preferably 1, 2, 3 or 4, C<br>
atoms. Alkyl is preferably methyl, furthermore ethyl,<br>
propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl or tert-<br>
butyl, furthermore also pentyl, 1-, 2- or 3—<br>
methylbutyl, 1,1-, 1,2- or 2,2-dimethylpropyl, 1-<br>
ethylpropyl, hexyl, 1-, 2-, 3- or 4-methylpentyl, 1,1-,<br>
1,2-, 1,3-, 2,2-, 2,3- or 3,3-dimethylbutyl, 1- or 2-<br>
ethylbutyl, 1-ethyl-1-methylpropyl, l-ethyl-2- <br>
meth.ylpropyl, 1,1,2- or 1, 2, 2-trimethylpropyl.<br>
Aryl is preferably unsubstituted phenyls or<br>
phenyl which is mono- or disubstituted by Hal,OA or<br>
alkyl, furthermore, for example, biphenyl or naphthyl.<br>
Heteroaryl is preferably, for example, furanyl,<br>
thiophenyl, pyridinyl, pyrrolyl or thiazolyl.<br>
Si(R3}3 is preferably, for example, Si(CH3)3.<br>
COR3 is preferably, for example, acetyl or<br>
benzoyl.<br>
R is preferably, in particular, for example,<br>
methoxy or ethoxy.<br>
R1 is in particular, for example, methyl,<br>
ethyl, propyl, butyl, phenyl, Si(CH3-)3 or acetyl.<br>
R2 is, in particular, for example, H, tert-<br>
butyl, Si(CH3)3, acetyl, benzyl or benzoyl, very<br>
particularly preferably it is H.<br><br>
The amides of the formula (III) prepared can be<br>
converted in a simple manner reductively, if<br>
appropriate by removal of the protective group from the<br>
hydroxyl group of the pyrrolidine in N-methyl-N-[(1S)-<br>
l-phenyl-2-((3S)-3-hydroxypyrrolidin-1-yl)ethane] or N-<br>
methyl-N-[(1R)-1-phenyl-2-((3R)-3-hydroxypyrrolidin-1-<br>
yl) ethane] of the formula (IV).<br>
By reaction with activated carboxylic acids of<br>
the formula (V)<br><br>
in which<br>
R4 is F, Cl, Br, I, OA or O-CO-<br>
it is possible to obtain from the free bases of the<br>
compounds of the formula (IV)<br><br>
or from their salts, formed with HC1, HBr, HI, H2SO4,<br>
H3PO4 or suitable organic acids, the enantiomeric<br>
compounds of the formula (VI)<br><br>
in pure form. Preferably, these compounds are prepared<br>
as hydrochlorides, the compound N-methyl-N-[(1S)-1-<br><br><br>
phenyi-2- ( (3S) -3-hydroxypyrrolidin-1-yl) ethyl] -2,2-di-<br>
phenylacetamide being the known form EMD 61753; but the<br>
corresponding salts with the other abovementioned acids<br>
can also be prepared analogously.<br>
In particular, N-methyl-N-[(1S)-1-phenyl-2-<br>
{{3S} -3-hydroxypyrrolidin-1-yl)ethyl]-2,2-diphenylacet-<br>
amide can be prepared by the last reaction with<br>
diphenylacetyl chloride.<br>
The compounds of the formula (IV) synthesized<br>
as intermediates can generally be obtained by reaction<br>
of compounds of the formula (I) with those of the<br>
formula (II). Preferably, compounds of the formula (I)<br>
are used in this reaction in which R has the meaning<br>
OR1 where R1 is A, aryl, hetefoaryl, Si(R3)3 or COR2 and<br>
R2 is H, alkyl, aryl or heteroalkyl, having the<br>
preferred meanings indicated above. Surprisingly, in<br>
contrast to the use of the corresponding formyl<br>
compound, enantiomerically pure reaction products of<br>
the formula (III) are obtained. In this manner, the<br>
resolution of the racemate can advantageously be<br>
omitted.<br>
The reaction of the compounds -{I) and (II) can<br>
be carried out in any desired aprotic solvent.<br>
Particularly suitable solvents are polar aprotic<br>
solvents from the group consisting of diethylether,<br>
petroleum ether, acetone, nitrobenzene, dimethyl-<br>
formamide, dimethyl sulphoxide or other corresponding<br>
solvents. In this connection, the starting materials<br>
are taken up in sufficient solvent such that a 10 to 30<br>
percent solution is obtained. Preferably, the reaction<br>
is carried out in tetrahydrofuran as a solvent.<br>
The reactions of the compounds (I) and (II) are<br>
carried out under suitable conditions at temperatures<br>
between 0 and 50°C. Particularly good results, however,<br>
are achieved at room temperatures between 20 and 30°C<br>
and at normal pressure.<br>
For the activation of the starting materials,<br>
the presence of an auxiliary reagent is necessary.<br>
These can be auxiliaries which are also used as peptide<br><br>
coupling reagents. Suitable compounds are those such<br>
as, for example, phosphorus oxytrichloride, phosphorus<br>
halides of valency III and V, phosgene,<br>
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, the triburtylammonium salt of<br>
pyridine, phenyl dichlorophosphate, 2-chloro-l,2,3-<br>
trinitrobenzene, phosphoric acid esters, chloro-<br>
sulphonyl isocyanate, CH3SO2Cl- (C2H5)3N, (C6H5)3P-CCl4-<br>
(C2H5)3N, N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole, N-(alkylcarbonyl)-<br>
imidazoles, acid anhydrides or acid chlorides and in<br>
particular alkyl chloroformates, such as ethyl<br>
chloroformate. Other suitable auxiliary reagents are<br>
described in various reference books, such as, for<br>
example, in C. Ferri "Reaktionen der organischen<br>
Synthese" ["Reactions of Organic Synthesis"]; R. C.<br>
Larock "Comprehensive Organic Transformations; A Guide<br>
to Functional Group Preparations", Verlag Chemie, 1989.<br>
Furthermore, the presence of a base , is<br>
necessary. Suitable bases can likewise be inferred from<br>
the abovementioned reference books. Such bases are, for<br>
example, tertiary amines, such as, for example,<br>
triethylamine. However, inorganic bases can also be<br>
added. Suitable inorganic bases are, in particular,<br>
carbonates. When using the alkyl metal hydroxides, such<br>
as NaOH or KOH, attention is particularly to be paid to<br>
exact addition, since otherwise undesired side<br>
reactions occur. For simplification of the work-up,<br>
however, it is also possible to employ the<br>
hydroxypyrrolidine in an excess., so that it acts as a<br>
base itself.<br>
The work-up of the reaction product (III)<br>
obtained ca'n be carried out from the filtrate after<br>
filtering off the precipitate obtained using customary<br>
laboratory methods. For example, a customary and<br>
suitable method consists in distilling off the solvent,<br>
taking up the crude product again in an organic<br>
solvent, extracting the solution obtained with water a<br>
number of times, distilling off the solvent again and<br>
recrystallizing the product obtained by<br>
recrystallization from a suitable solvent, such as, for<br><br>
example, from methanol. However, other working-up<br>
variants known to the person skilled in the art are<br>
also possible, such as, for example, those which<br>
additionally include a chromatographic purification.<br>
Depending on the reaction conditions, the<br>
reaction product (III) is obtained from a water-<br>
containing solvent mixture as a free base or as an acid<br>
addition salt of the acids HCl, HBr, HI, H2SO4 or of an<br>
organic carboxylic acid. In the latter cases, the<br>
isolation can be carried out after the phase separation<br>
according to customary laboratory methods.<br>
Suitable organic carboxylic acids which can be<br>
used are, in particular, aliphatic, alicyclic,<br>
araliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic mono- or<br>
polybasic carboxylic, sulphonic or sulphuric acids,<br>
e.g. formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, pivalic<br>
acid, diethylacetic acid, malonic acid, succinnic acid,<br>
pimelic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, lactic acid,<br>
tartaric acid, malic acid, citric acid, gluconic acid,<br>
ascorbic acid, nicotinic acid, isonicotinic acid,<br>
methane- or ethanesulphonic acid, ethanedisulphonic<br>
acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulphonic acid, benzenesulphonic<br>
acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid, naphthalene -mono- and<br>
-disulphonic acids, lauryl sulphuric acid.<br>
The compounds of the formula (III) are reduced<br>
under a protective gas atmosphere, e.g. under a<br>
nitrogen atmosphere, in the presence of a hydride<br>
transfer reagent. Suitable hydride transfer reagents<br>
are those from the group consisting of the metal<br>
aluminium hydrides, preferably lithium aluminium<br>
hydride, metal alkoxyaluminium hydrides, such as, for<br>
example, Li triethoxyaluminium hydride, metal<br>
borohydrides, preferably NaBH4, or borane, the presence<br>
of a Lewis acid additionally being necessary, such as,<br>
for example, boron trifluoride.<br>
The reduction is preferably carried out in a<br>
polar aprotic and hydride-inert solvent. Suitable<br>
solvents are the same as already mentioned above.<br><br>
Particularly suitable solvents are, for example,<br>
diethylether or tetrahydrofuran.<br>
To carry out the hydrogenation, a compound of<br>
the formula (III) is dissolved in a suitable solvent<br>
and added with warming to a solution which contains the<br>
hydride transfer reagent in equimolar amounts or in a<br>
small excess. However, it is also possible to introduce<br>
the starting compound to be hydrogenated and to add the<br>
hydrogenation reagent in an appropriate amount in a<br>
suitable manner such that a reaction mixture is<br>
obtained in which the starting material has a<br>
concentration of 10 to 25% by weight, based on the<br>
solvent. To complete the reaction, the reaction mixture<br>
is stirred under reflux conditions for a number of<br>
hours. The reaction solution is then processed<br>
according to methods known to the person skilled in the<br>
art, by decomposing, inter alia, by addition of a<br>
solvent mixture consisting of a proton-yielding and an<br>
aprotic solvent, the excess of hydride transfer reagent<br>
and liberating the reaction product. Suitable proton-<br>
yielding solvents are, for example, water or alcohols<br>
such as ethanol or methanol. 'Suitable aprotic solvents<br>
are all polar aprotic solvents already mentioned above,<br>
in particular tetrahydrofuran. The latter is preferably<br>
employed, since it is obtainable industrially as an<br>
anhydrous product.<br>
Product work-up can be carried out after phase<br>
separation according to customary laboratory methods.<br>
The crude product obtained can be worked up by<br>
crystallization methods or, for work-up, it is taken<br>
up, for example, in an organic water-immiscible solvent<br>
and treated with an excess of an inorganic acid,<br>
preferably hydrochloric acid. The salt formed in this<br>
manner can then be separated off in crystalline form.<br>
The further reaction of N-methyl-N-[(1S)-1-<br>
phenyl-2-((3S)-3-hydroxypyrrolidin-1-yl)ethane or its<br>
dihydrochloride with a suitable diphenyl acetic acid<br>
derivative, preferably the acid chloride, to give the<br>
desired final product N-methyl-N-[(1S)-1-phenyl-2-<br><br>
( (3S)-3-hydroxypyrrolidin-1-yl)ethyl]-2 2-diphenylacet-<br>
amide (formula VI, EMD 61753) is carried out according<br>
to methods such as are described in DE-Al-40 34 785 and<br>
DE-Al-42 15 213 or EP 0 569 802 Al.<br>
" The examples given below are given for<br>
illustration of the present invention, but cannot be,<br>
used to restrict the claimed invention thereto, since<br>
different variations of the examples are possible and<br>
lead to the desired product N-methyl-N-[(1S)-1-phenyl-<br>
2-((3S) —3-hydroxypyrrolidin-1-yl)ethane [formula (IV)],<br>
which can be used as- an intermediate for the<br>
