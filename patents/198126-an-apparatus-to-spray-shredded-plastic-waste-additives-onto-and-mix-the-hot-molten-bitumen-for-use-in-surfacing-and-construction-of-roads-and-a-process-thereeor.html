				<td>This invention relates to an Apparatus to spray shredded plastic waste additives onto and mix the hot molten bitumen contained in an enclosure and a process therefor for use in surfacing and construction of roads and to improve durability and strength of asphalt road and enhance the useful life of roads.<br>
In the roads and pavements construction, use of bitumen is a common feature in addition to sand and gravel.  In spite of this, bitumen pavements and roads fail early due to in¬creased overloading of trucks, causing early development of distress symptoms like cracking, shoving, bleeding and undu¬lations.  The other major factor of serious concern is vary¬ing climates prevailing in India.  Under these conditions, flexible pavements tend to become soft in summer and brittle in winter.<br>
The methods and processes may have improved the quality of the road surfacing with molten bitumen but the durability and quality leave much to be desired.  A good amount of work has been done on the utilization of the plastic waste in the form of additives or blend of additives in India and abroad particularly by using either polyethylene or polypropylene.<br>
Most of the methods of processing of plastic waste start uniformly from a bituminous mix prepared by mixing plastic waste with bitumen, with or without a chemical or a solvent, which is ultimately mixed with molten bitumen.  The use of modified bitumen is now a fairly established practice in some countries.<br>
Normal methods adopted for the pre-mix is polyethylene or polypropylene which is coated with lime wash dried is mix¬ed with molten bitumen with jellies gravel or stones at a high temperature and thereafter spread on the surface of the roads requiring surfacing.  This has shown that polyolefin improves the properties of the bituminous mixes for construction of road.  Most particularly, polyolefin addition will increase the cohesion of the materials and load bearing capacity as well as the useful life of the material and to bear the wear<br><br>
and tear of the climatic conditions of weather*  Further modified bitumen is expected to give 50 to 100 percent higher life of surfacing depending upon the degree of modi¬fication and types of additives used in the bituminous road construction.  Furthermore the potential benefits are increased pavement life, retardation of reflection cracking, decreased traffic noise, reduced maintenance cost, decreased pollution and increased environmental qua¬lity through reduction in littered polyolefin wastes. For some reason or the other no processes could be industriali¬sed in India either on Indian know-how or imported techno¬logy.<br>
In the prior art the polymer addition to the molten bitumen is completely burnt and obnoxious smell toxic gases are produced polluting the environment causing irritation to the eyes and body as this is done at a high temperature so that the polyolefins are completely burned and merged with the molten bitumen.  Furthermore in order to make the polymers mix with the bitumin various chemicals oilS and flexes are added or cleaning the polymer additives, making the production extremely costly.<br>
Still further more the proposal to use specific type of waste plastic sueh as polyethylene or polypropylene face the problem of cost of collecting the plastics costly and such efforts do little to solve the problem of ut51ization of vast unsortedi unsortable of unclassified garbage - bulk mix of plastic waste.<br>
Accordingly, there remains a need for a low cost manner of enhancing the properties of paving material and use of waste plastic, particularly unclassified materials or mate¬rials of mixed classes*  The paving material comprising a mixture of an asphalt binder end an aggregate including at least five per cent by volume of mechanically reduced parti¬cles of plastic waste or recycled plastics should be used. This is achieved effectively by means of an apparatus for mixing plastic waste shredded.<br>
The paving product is preferably formed by a process<br><br>
of granulating step by shradding of aechnically granulates used by industrial waste plastic to a number o*4 to i inch sieve size and preferably to larger than 1/e in sixe to sfoaller 1 inch to 3/8" inch granules to form particles there¬of predominantly larger than 1/6 inch in size to smaller than 3/B inch in size.      The granulars ^re then treated with an energized activity medium such as plasma or a lime wash or reducing flame nt^le maintaining the temperature of the particles sufficiently low and for sufficiently short to activate tho surface ci the granules preferably withtAit subs¬tantially burning or melting the plastic particles.       The activated granules are then {Sttssed through the hopper of the Apparatus to be tf^arayed onto tha surface of the hot molten bitumen in the enclosure outside the apparatus wherein the molten bituoMin is at a high teo^rature to be mized   for surfacing the road.<br>
In the present invention shredded plastic waste by mechanical means or granulation step is dorH» and firstly cleaned with ealdum hydroKide» dried by means of hot air and used as an additive according to the size of the granules specified herein above to molten bitumen by means of an apparatus through which the shredded plastic waste goes through the hopper and the hot air chamber and blown through a narrow tube and sprayed onto the molten bitumen which is flowing in an enclosure «dlth sggtagates and oized fit a temperature of I"SOPc to 160% to obtain modified bitumen* The properties of the raodifitd bitumen whc* eompared with ordinary bitumen (i*e*without any plastics granules or pieces) so far ^9 penetration and ductility values are concerned decreased with the increase in proportions of plastic additives upto 12 9^ by weight*     The softening point of the modified bitumen increased further «dth the addition of plastic additives*<br>
The main objective of the invention Is the disposal and utilization of the plastic waste that has 2&gt;een causing innumerable problems in the city and the outskirts cf the cities and to keep clean and friendly environments*<br><br>
The sacond objective of the present Inwention Is to in* prove the   durability and strarigth ofafiphalt rosd and eni^noa tho useful life of roads*<br>
A further objective is to aake the production of bituoHin-roed surfacing cost effective by laeane of reduc¬tion in the use of f-he bitisaen^ sand and gravels*<br>
Anotiter objective is to provide a preferred apparatus for spraying the shredded plastic vuaste additives onto tne surface of the uolten bitUM«n thus talking the Oi^era-tion cortvcnient and economically cheaper*<br>
The present invention is rauoh different from the prior art as this is kisod on the uco of «.ll tyoec of vmste plas¬tics used at one go as against the prior art only one type ot plastic is used - polyethylone or polypropyiine*     Further more, in the present invention an apoaratus for_8Praying the shredded plastic vtsste onto the molten bitumen is en^loyed*<br>
Before asking a commercial use of the present invention extensive rtsearch» extended experintntation and in   dtepth investigations have been conducted on the subject by making various mixes of polyolefin to ascertain the strength ehrao-teristics on polyolafin modified bitumen at different percentage on the additive* on the following aspects*<br>
♦   The behaviour of SO / XOO gr-"^do bitumen with and without the addition of the bitumen ildUivtt*<br>
   The effect of compressive strength of compacted bituminous loixturo on addition of polyolefin additives*<br>
   The effect of soaking on compressive strength of compacted bituaainout mixes with and without polyolefin additlvest<br>
The above experiments tuero condacted subsequent to the date on Mhich the Applicants Mr* K. Abated Khan and Mr. K. Pasool Khan completed their invention as set forth in their ponding Patent Application 1to.652/ms/200l, filed on<br><br>
NO.652/MAS/2001, filed on 6th August 2001 for production or use of plastic<br>
waste in asphalt road constructions.<br>
EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS:<br>
Aggregates (gravels)<br>
Investigations conducted on the aggregates used for the bituminous mix<br>
design were first sieved  and blended by mechanical stabilization.     The<br>
obtained gradation of aggregates is as follows.   It should be understood that<br>
these are by way of illustrations, than by way of limitations and many<br>
variations may be made in the process conditions:<br>
The aggregates that were used for the bituminous mix design were sieved<br>
and blended by mechanical stabilization according to the standards fixed by<br>
the MINISTRY OF SURFACE TRANSPORT (MOST). The obtained gradation of<br>
aggregates is as follows:-<br>
TABLE-1: Gradation of Aggregate for Designing BC (Bitumen content)<br>
Material A= Below 20mm	Material B = Below 10   mm<br><br><br>
The gradation of a bituminous mix including the density and stability are very dependent on the aggregates and their grain size distribution. The gradation of final mix after blending of the aggregates and filler should be within the specified range. The method and proportioning of materials for the aggregate mix to satisfy the requirements of MOST determined by Rothfutch"s method and the results are given in Table 2. Rothfutch"s Method may be used when a number of materials have to be mixed together for obtaining a desired or design gradation. The desired gradation may be decided either based on recommended grain size distribution charts or tablet or by using theoretical equation. The factors to be considered in the design of mix are gradation, density, index properties and stability. Of these the gradation is the most important factor. The desired gradation may be decided either based on recommended grain size distribution, charts or tablets or by using a theoretical gradation equation for maximum density is given by:<br>
Here P = Percent finer than diameter *d" (m) in the material D = dismeter largest particle, mm n = gradation index, which has values ranging from 0.5 to 0.3 depending upon the shape.<br>
OPTIMUM BITUMEN CONTENT or the Right percentage of binder in the mixture: The requirements of Bitumen mixes are:<br>
The Bitumens paving mixes, should aim at an economical blend with proper gradation of aggregates and adequate proportion of bitumen so as to fulfill the designed proportions of the mix. The desirable properties of a good bituminous mix are stability durability, flexibility skid resistance and workability.<br><br>
stability is defined as resistance of the paving mix to deformation under load<br>
and this it is stress which cause a specified stress depending upon artificial<br>
field conditions stability is a function of friction and cohesion.<br>
Durability is defined as the resistance of the mix against weathering and<br>
corrosive action.<br>
Flexibility is a property of the mix that measures the level being strength.<br>
This suitability of the given bituminous mix needs the consideration of all<br>
the factors listed above.<br>
Skid resistance is defined as the resistance of the finished pavement against<br>
skidding and is a function of surface texture and bitumen content.<br>
The sieve size test date of individual sizes and aggregate gradation adopted<br>
as per MOST specification was selected and the same for the mix is adopted.<br>
To find the Optimum Bitumen content (OBC), Marshall Test specimens were<br>
prepared by adding 4.5%, 5.0%, 5.5% and 6.0% of bitumen (by weight of<br>
aggregates) to the pre weighed pre-heated a^regate additives.    The said<br>
mixture of aggregate additives and bitumen was manually stirred and placed<br>
in preheated mould. The mix was then compacted in a Marshall compactor,<br>
applying   75   blows   one-"ach   side   with   the   hammer.      The   compacted<br>
specimens were tested to bulk density, stability and flow.   Marshall Method<br>
of mix design was used for the determination of optimum additive content<br>
and other properties of the mix at optimum additive content.<br><br><br>
COMPRESSIVE STRESS TEST<br>
Procedure for preparation of the Mirthall Teat Speeiiaen:<br>
The calculated quantity of aggregate fractions for each apeciraen mentioned herein above was weigM^d end heated to « temperature of 163**C»      Paqulred quantity of bitumen was heated in a separated container to a tes^rature of 163^C £nd shreddod polyolefin or plastic bags were 4dded to bitumen at 163^C end stirred to about 5 to 10 minutes contimjously and mixed with heated aggregates*     After laixinc thorou^yy the proparad mixture ««&amp; alloMed to cool to fBoulding temperature of 124^0 as quickly as possi¬ble and compacted in the mould to a desired cylindrical specimen of height 10 em and diameter 10 cm« iinder uniform rate of compressive loading,      Ihen the cylindrical oped* men wse removed fr&amp;si the tnould with an ejection device that provides a smooth^ uniform rate of travel for the ejection head.     The test specimen was allowed to cool at room temperature for at least 2 hours and its bulk density was determined.<br>
Each set of four specimens prepared was separated into two groups each of two specimens.   The first sot of test specimens were brought to the test temperature<br><br>
temperature of about 250°C by storing them in an air bath maintained at the test temperature for at least not less than 4 hours and their compressive strengths were determined. Second set of test specimens were immersed in water bath for 24 hours at 60°C and then they were brought to the test temperature of 240°C by storing them in a water bath maintained at the test temperature for 2 hours. The compressive strength of the soaked specimens were then determined. The percentage index retained strength of bituminous mixtures to detrimental effect of water was calculated. The specification for testing the bituminous mix specimen is as per Research Agencies ASTM D 1074 - 76.<br>
Test Procedure for Conducting Compressive Strength Test The specimens were tested in axial compression without lateral support at a uniform rate of vertical deformation of 2.5 mm/min. The results of the compressive strength test for compacted bituminous mixture (with the bitumen additive) for a soaked and un soaked conditions are given in Table 4. The results of the compressive strength of different bituminous mixture were comp&gt;ared for both soaked and un soaked conditions and are gjven in Table 5. The compressive strength test results are given in Graph 1.<br>

FINDINGS:<br>
1. From the laboratory test results obtained in this present investigation, it can be seen that the compressive strength of the compacted bituminous mix increases as the percent of additive increases. The compressive strength value at%, 8%, 10% and 12% polyolefm additive are 17.64 kg/cm2, 22.6 kg/cm2, 28.7 kg/cm2and 30.39 kg/cm2 respectively.<br><br>
A process for the preparation of modified bitumen mix with the use of waste plastic additives using an appa¬ratus, described hereinabove, for road surfacing comprises „ of the steps of<br>
(a)	Cleaning waste plastic materials with a jet of water and shredded by means of shredding machines or grinders into small particles or granules and<br>
(b)	treating the said granules with calcium hydroxide in an agglomeration machine by means of hot air ovens at a temperature just warm enough to increase the surface tension that will cause the activation or increased energization at the surface of the particles to a dhere to the bitumen and<br>
(c)	filling up the hopper with the said plastic granules, additives into the hopper wherein the wipers facilitate the downward movement of the additives into the blowing chamber wherein<br>
(d)	the said warm additives rush out by the high speed of wind by the blower on to the opening at one end of the blowing chamber with velocity through tubular channel with a narrow nozzle connected to the hosepipe and<br>
(e)	ispraying onto the hot mixture of gravel/<br>
stones and bitumen with the velocity and impreg¬nated uniformly on the conveyor metal belt in rotational movement to form modified bitumen for surfacing road construction.<br>
The process described briefly below has a novel approach in that it is the various steps involved in the pessent inven¬tion.  Firstly plastic waste has to be obtained from garbage for utilisation.  This is further seggregated to various types of waste plastics.  The waste plastic is shredded and purification of the same or granules and drying the shredded plastic is passed through the hopper of the Apparatus to be sprayed onto the surface of the hot molten bitumen in<br><br>
the enclosure outside the apparatus at a high temperature to be mixed for surfacing the road.<br>
The plastics are aggregated into (a) too much of dirty plastics and (b) oily plastics means soily dirt. These are first cleaned to remove the loose particles attached to the waste plastic bags, such as mud and dirt and remove the ink impressions on the surface by means of water and chemicals and a further process of cleaning with a jet of water and the clean plastic waste is shredded dried by hot air oven. The cleaned dried plastic waste undergoes a further process of grinding to a smallest particles or granules.  The grinded plastics are then processed in agglomeration machine to mix the chemicals such as calcium hydroxide to make it possible fox mixing with bitumen.  The shredded plastic waste trea¬ted with lime and dried is passed through the hopper of the Apparatus to be sprayed onto the surface of the hot molten bitumen at high temperature to be mixed for surfacing the roads.  The temperature of the bitumen at the time of spray¬ing of the shredded plastic waste is around 160°C and above. The mix is kept cooling upto a temperature ranging upto 60°C when the mix or bitumen and plastic is used for spreading on the road for construction to obtain the maximum advantage.<br>
The present invention has been tested in the laboratory as well as on the field and the results conform to the objectives and advantages mentioned hereinabove.<br>
The process and the apparatus combined therewith is the novelty and inventive steps of the present invention.  The process involved in the use of shredded plastic waste by means of an apparatus in mixing the plastics in molten bitumen has already been described.  The apparatus which is also called "Dozing machine" comprises of a hopper (i) connected to a blowing chamber (5) by means of a guiding barrel (4) at one end of the blowing chamber an electrical centrifugal blower (ii) is installed and at the other end of the blowing chamber a tubular channel with a narrow nozzle (6) is connected to the enclosure or a hot molten bitumen is pumped (17) at the middle of the chamber (Fig,2) and hot and heated gravel (stones) comes out at the mouth (16)<br><br>
and mix with molten bitumen and at the centre of the bitumen hot chamber (Fig.2) and moves on rotating with bitumen plastic additives blown through tubular channel (16) pass through another pipe (19) which runs parallel with the bitumen pipe (17) is sprayed onto the mixture of hot bitumen, gravel/stones and adhere to the mixture firmly.<br>
The aforesaid novel apparatus combined with a process for the purpose of mixing waste plastic additives into the bitumen for commercial purpose has been invented and called the "Dozing Machine".<br>
The Present invention will now be described hereunder with reference to the accompanying drawing, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 is the sectional view of the Dozing Machine and Fig. 2 is a schematic view of the rotating enclosure containing hot molten bitumen to which sand and hot gravel is added and the position of shredded plastic waste additives sprayed onto the mix¬ture of bitumen.<br>
In Fig.l a hopper (l) with a capacity to hold about 35 Kg. of waste plastice shredded additives is positioned at the top of the "Dozing Machine*.  At the center of the hopper a spiral screw (3) passes downwards from half the height of the hopper and extends outside the guiding barrel (4).  At the top end of the spiral screw a horizontal bar (15) is attached from the center and both ends of the horizontal bar (15) are attached with vertically aligned wipers (2).  The guiding barrel (4) is attached to a blowing chamber (5).  This blowing chamber (5) is connected on one side with an electrical centrifugal blower with a 2 HP AC Motor (H) and the blowing chamber has an opening on the other side connected to a tubular channel with a narrow nozzle (6).  This narrow nozzle is further connected to the hot bitumen chamber by means of a hosepipe bent downwards at an angle.  The spiral screw (3) passed through a thrust bearing unit (7) and extends outside this bearing unit at the bottom.  The bottom end of the spiral screw is fitted with a sprocket (13).  The sprocket is connected by means of a chair to a warm reduction gear box (d)»<br><br>
reduction gear box (8)»  The worn reduction gearbox Is connected to the Main AC Motor (10) fay means of a rubber coupling (9)»  All these e
tbs) manner In «Aiich the present invention relating to the apparatus is carried out in actual practice Mill now be described as under*<br>
The shredded waste plastic additive are filled into the<br>
hopper of the Apparatus.  The blower is started first so that<br>
the blowing chamber of the Apparatus is pressurized with high<br>
speed wind which passes through the opening on the one side*<br>
Then the toain motor is started which drives the spiral screw<br>
in one direction, which pushes the shredded plastic additive<br>
down the guiding barrel and into the blowing chamber*<br>
The high-speed wind blown by the blower makes the  ^<br>
polyolefin additives to rush into the opening of the blowing<br>
chakber with high velocity*  The flow" quantity of ths waste<br>
plastic additives shredded are drawn into the blowing chamber<br>
and is controlled by increasing or decreasing the number of<br>
rotations of the spiral screw by increaa^ing or decreasiti^the speed of the main motor and the speed of the motor is controlled by the AC inverter*  The wipa^ in the hopp<sr ttim></sr>
made to rotate along with the spiral screw keep the polyolefin<br>
additives in loose form to facilitate\ smooth pushing of the \ same through the guiding barrel and iryto the blowing chamber* One end of the opening of the blowing ^andMir having a tubu* \;<br>
lar chamber with a narrow nozzle is connected to the rotating v<br>
to mix chamber by a hopepipe*       ^	"<br>
deferring to Fig*No*2t the polyolefin or waste plastic in shredded form blow from the Apparatus /Dozing Machine enters the rotating hot mix chamber from the side which is installed at a lower height compared to the other end of the mixing chamber which is installed at an elevated height of about 3<br><br>
feet difference.      The elevated end of the rotating   hot nix chanber has an opening to facilitate continuous gravel filling done by a conve/or belt driven by an AC motor in a constant speed.     A the mouth (16) of the elevated end, a vigorously burning flame directed inside the rotating hot mix chamber heats the gravel to nearly 180°C by the time it reaches the middle point of the rotating chamber The preheated bitumen with a temperature of approximately 165°C is pumped Into the rotating hot mix chamber through the pipe (17), which enters the hot mix chamber from the other side (18) Mhieh is installed at a loM«r height and extends almost up to the center of rotating chamber and the end is bent downwards to facilitate smooth fall of the heated bitumen.      The phredded plastic waste additives blown from the Apparatus pass through another pipe (19) that runs paralledl to the bitumen pipe*      The end point of this second pipe is located about a foot behind the end point of the bituminous pipe*     The fhrtdded plastic waste additive is sprayed on to the mixture of hot bitumen and the gravel.      Due to the hot temperature inside the rotating hot mix chamber which is maintained around IKfiC, the shredded plastic waste additive gets heated before it Heehes average BMlting point of the shredded plastic waste additives which is around 130°C     This heating of the plastic fdditives aaket it to get impregnated with the hot bituminous nix and oreetes the property of binding due to the fiber like chraeter or shape of the additives compounds.     This hot mixtuz* of bitttaent gravel and shredded plastic waste additives gets embedded continuously and poured out from the lowly placed 9n4 of the rotating hot mix chamber from where it is loaded to the lorries and transported to the site where the roads   are being constructed*<br><br><br>
