				<td>This invention relates to Life Saving Cell Phone System.<br>
This invention relates to Life Saving Cell Phone System. Wherein an abnormality detector with a short range transmitter (hereinafter referred to as SRT) is attached to the wrist watch of the user. Abnormality detector periodically keeps track of the pulse Whenever there is abnormal change, it activates the SRT which then sends signal to the short range receiver (hereinafter referred to as SRR) incorporated in the cell phone. The cell phone sends help signal to the Mobile Telephone Switching Office (hereinarter referred to as MTSO). The cell phone is then located by Tri-Circlc method using the received signal's strength by a base station and two towers in a cell site and medical assistance is sent. The cell phone is also made to ring an alarm which can help the medical team to reach the location with case. Thus invaluable human lives can be saved. Further the system works even when the cell phone is turned off due to SRR switches it on with the help of a Squelch circuit.<br>
Enormous number of people die due to lack of medical aid at the appropriate time as in the case of road accident in the remote areas, sudden imbalances in a person living alone in his house or heart attacks in the nights. In such cases, the whole accident may go unnoticed and by the time it is discovered, it may have been too late.<br>
In this fast-paced world, no one has time to spend leisurely with their neighbours or even to gossip. In this machine life, lot of accidents arc going unnoticed and due to our inability to provide medical assistance to the victims at the appropriate time and at appropriate place, precious lives are in danger.<br>
A basic cellular system consists of three parts: a mobile unit, a cell site, and a mobile telephone switching office (MTSO with connections to link the three subsystems.<br>
The mobile unit is a mobile telephone unit containing a control unit, a transceiver, and an antenna system.<br>
The cell site provides interface between the MTSO and the mobile units. It has control unit, radio cabinets, antennas, a power plant and data terminals.<br>
The MTSO comprises the switching office, central co-ordinating element for all Cell sites, cont;iins cellular processor and cellular switch. It interfaces with telephone company rone offices, controls call processing and handles billing activities.<br>
The radio and high speed data links connect three subsystems. Each mobile unit can only use one channel for its communication link. But the channel is not fixed; it can be any one in entire band assigned by serving area, with each site having multichannel capabilities that can connect simuhancously to many mobile units.<br><br>
The MTSO is the heart of the cellular mobile system. Its processor provides the central coordination and cellular administration.<br>
The cellular switch, which can be cither analog or digital, switches calls to connect the mobile subscribers to other mobile subscribers and to nationwide telephone network. 11 uses the voice trunks similar to telephone company inter office voice trunks. It also contains datd links providing supervision links between the processor and switch and between the cell sites and the processor. The radio links carries the voice and signaling between the mobile unit and the cell site. The high speed data links can't be transmitted over the standard telephone trunks and therefore must use either microwave links or 1-carriers (wire lines). Microwave radio links or T-carriers carry both voice and data between the cell site and MTSO as shown in Fig 1 below showing the basic Cellular system.<br>
The main object of this invention is to modify the basic existing cellular system which can be used as a life saving ceil phone system helpfiil in attending to a person living alone and requires immediate help (medical) in the situation like heart attack or accident.<br>
Whenever a human body is affected, physically or mentally, there is a change in the pulse rate. In the case of serious problems, there is a drastic change in the pulse rate. In the system designed by us, we sense this change and compare it with normal level to arrive at conclusion.<br>
Normal pulse rate of a human being is 60 to 100 beats/min. If we, the human beings suffer (by any means - physically or mentally) pulse rate will be affected first (body temperature also gets affected). If pulse rate changes below or above certain level, then it is a indication that we need medical assistance right then. So, if we detect any abnormal change in pulse rate of user by Abnormality detector kept around the wrist (explained latter) and is informed to cell phone (by means of SR transmission), then cell phone will send help signal to the MSTO using the existing cellular system. On receiving the help signal from any cell, MTSO has to locate the cellphone (i.e.thc user). Then, it should send medical assistance (say ambulance) to the spot immediately. Meanwhile, it has to activate the alarm circuit so that it will be useful for medical team to reach the spot exactly. Thus, precious lives of the victims are saved. The diagram of the Life Saving Cell Phone System is shown in fig. 2<br>
â€¢ As mentioned already, external temperature of body also changes in case of sufferings but not in all cases. For example in case of some heart problems, external temperature of our body remains constant. Infact sensing temperature and using it in the Life Saving Cell Phone System this invention is easy because temperature sensor can be in-built within cell phone. This short range transmission is avoided reducing the complexity of the system. But pulse rate varies for almost all the cases. So we are opting for pulse rate rather than temperature. However principle of temperature sensing can also be used in the system of this invention.<br><br>
The overall Life Saving Cell Phone System of this invention can be visualized from fig. 3.<br>
The abnomiality detector is kept around the wrist-so that it can keep track on user's (cell phone user's) pulse rate. This can be achieved by placing detector on user's watch. Small battery is provided for this part which should be rechargeable or a solar cell. The block diagram given in fig. 4 is illustrating the abnormality detector of this invention and the internal circutory of the abnormality detector of this invention is given in fig.5.<br>
A device that detects electro chemical reactions on skin surface of living organism that corresponds to the biomedical signals within that organism is called 'biopotential electrode'<br>
Sensors used to convert body phenomena such as pulse rate, heat, pressure, blood flow or motion, into electrical signals are classified as transducers.<br>
In this invention a pulse sensor are preferably used in the abnormality detector which senses the pulse rate of the human body and converts it into electrical signals (in the range 10 micro volt to 5 milli volt), which is required to be amplified for fiarther processing. Voltage corresponding to normal pulse rate (arbitrarily chosen as 80 beats/min) is pre-determined by pulse sensor and amplified. This reference voltage Vref is applied at teminal B (fig.5) voltage corresponding to pulse rate is determined by pulse sensor and amplified to the same amount as Vref. This voltage Vuscr is applied at the terminal A (fig.5). Output of differential amplifier corresponding to maximum tolerable variation in Vuscr is given by threshold voltage Voircs and is given to inverting terminal D (fig.5) of the comparator. Output of differential amplifier is given to non-inverting terminal C (fig.5) of comparator. If the voltage at C exceeds voltage at D (fig.5) (threshold voUage), then output of comparator becomes high and then SRT activator activates the short range transmitter. With advancement in VLSI technology above circuit can be fabricated in a small chip and it can be placed even in a watch as suggested.<br>
Voltage terms used in the following analysis are assumed that they are amplified to equal amount. This is important as output of pulse sensor is in range of 10 micro volt to 5 milli volt only<br>
Noraml pulse rate ^ 60 to 100 beats/min<br>
Maximum safety pulse rate == 100 beats/min<br>
Minimum safety pulse rate = 60 beats/min<br>
Reference pulse rate = 80 beats/min (since 80 is mid value)<br>
Vrcf- voltage corresponding to pulse rate of 80 beats/min<br>
Vuser - voltage corresponding to user's pulse rate<br>
V	maK - voltage corresponding to maximum safety pulse rate<br>
V	min - voltage corresponding to minimum safety pulse rate<br>
V	thrcs - threshold voltage of safety (V rcf ^ Vuscr should not exceed V tiircs)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
So, output of comparator goes high and hence SRT is activated. This mathematical analysis proves that SRT is activated only if user's pulse rate exceeds 100 beats/mm or lowers than 60 beats/min (both are dangerous and needs medical assistance badly and confirms the logical correctness of the given Abnormality detector's circuit.<br>
The short range transmitter (SRT). is a part of the abnormality detector and short range receiver (SRR) is a part of the cell phone but it is independent of handset's on/off state.<br>
If the short range transmitter is activated it transmits the signal at particular frequency. If it receives the signal, then the cell phone will send help signal through its reverse control channel using the existing mobile communication system.<br>
On receiving the signal from short range transmitter, cell phone, using the transistor switch switch on the handset (if necessary). Then, it transmits help signal to MSIO using existing cellular system. The block diagram of the handset of this invention is shown in fig.6.<br>
If cell is in off state, and if short range receiver-receives signal (i.e, output of short range receiver is high, then cellphone is switched on by cell phone activator using Squelcche s circuit shown in fig.7.<br>
If cell phone is in ON state, then cell phone transmits the help signal using existing system.<br>
But if it is in OFF state, then Squelch circuit is used to switch on the cell phone^ Rl R2 are selected such that when output of SRR is high, then only voltage across R2 wil be high enough to bias the transistor Q2. Then Ql also conducts Since Ql is Parallel to ON/OFF switch of cell phone, if Ql conducts, it act as short circuit and hence the cell phone is switched on.<br><br>
Then cellphone transmits help signal using existing system.<br>
MTSO on receiving the help signal from any cellphone, it should locate the user first, sends medical assistance and should activate the alarm signal in the user's cellphone.<br>
Depending on the strength of signal received at base station the approximate distance direction of user fix)m the base station is determined by using Tri-Circlc method as shown in fig.8. The victim, user of cell phone is alternatively located by methods like GPS (Global Positioning Service) or any such suitable method.<br>
For this, in each cell site, apart fix)m the base station, two towers are used. These two towers and base station ^should be placed such that they cover the entire cell site and depending on their received signal strength, draw the circles keeping each of them as centre. Point of intersection of 3 circles gives the exact location of the user.<br>
Here two towers used are not entirely base station but just transceivers. So it is economical. They inform the strength of the signal received to base station and base station can locate the user exactly (with strength of signal at 3 places) as explained in the<br>
fig.<br>
Thus, MTSO can locate the cell phone (user).<br>
MTSO, after locating, sends medical help via ambulance. Meanwhile it activates the alarm circuit in the cell phone so that medical team can find the victim easily, and rescue them.<br>
The circuit diagram of abnormality detector according to another embodiment of this invention is shown in Fig.9 in which a specification of various parameter are given as an example only which should not be considered limitative to these specifications.<br>
Another embodiment of abnormality detector is given in fig. 10 in which specification of various parameter are given as an example only which should not be considered limitative to these specifications.<br>
Alternatively circuit diagram of SRT activator is shown in fig. 11.<br>
Circuit diagram of cell phone part is shown in fig 12 in which a specification of various parameter are given as an example only which should not be considered limitative to these specifications.<br>
This suggested system will work even if cell phone is in OFF state by switching on it using cell phone activator.<br><br>
Even if the user is in a big house alone and if he is affected by mild heart attack or some other health problem, automatically he will get medical help immediately.<br>
In the case of big accident, (say collision of two passenger trains in a remote area) atlcast if any one has a cell phone, then all of them will get medical attention immediately thus saving lives of many innocents.<br>
In this machine life where human values arc not given importance, even those who arc in the accident spot are reluctant to help victims afraid of facing police investigation. Even hospitals are not ready to admit the accident victims. In this present scenario, suggested system of providing automatic medical help to those who are in need of it is a gift to the mankind.<br>
As this system provides medical help at appropriate time and at right place, it will decrease the death rate to large extent thus makes this world a safe place.<br>
In this system, we are just detecting any abnormality in bio medical signal and detecting it. In future it may be possible to process biomedical signal and find the type of problem, so that corresponding specialists may be sent to the spot. The suggested system can be extended so that even for small problems, medical consultation is provided via cell phone.<br>
This will certainly save the time and energy. Any threatening problems like cancer can be eradicated if detected at the beginning stage itself which may prove to be the boon to the human beings.<br>
If appropriate arrangements are made in the financial organizations like bank, then by using Tri circle method, police can automatically detect exact location of the place and reach the spot during the time of theft.<br>
Since FM receiver is used, false alarm call is eradicated. In addition to that, decoder circuits are used which will enable help signal transmission, only if particular digital data is received.<br>
This circuit will work even if the user is in roaming.<br>
Abnormality detector is independent of wrist watch mechanism. Also it will be better only if we have abnormality detector chip in separate band, so that supply say 9v can be given by means of small battery.<br>
Since unique code is provided for every user, interference can be avoided, more number of users can be accomdated.<br><br>
Transmitted signal is received at the antenna if receiver is turned to transmitted frequency and is demodulated and message (square wave) is obtained after C9.<br>
If message is obtained, then help signal is made to send to base station through reverse control channel. Also, if message is received, then transistor is made to conduct and voltage across R6 is high and since it is parallel to on/off status, cell phone is switched on despite it's on/off status.<br>
If call is made then mobile identification number (MIN) &amp; number to be called is send to base station through reverse control channel. Similarly, if message is received, MIN &amp; common help code (different from any existing phone number) is send to base station through reverse control channel.<br>
On receiving this code, base station should locate the mobile phone and medical assistance should be send.<br>
The above description with reference to drawings has been given just to understand the invention rather than to limit its scope.<br><br><br><br><br>
