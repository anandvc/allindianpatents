COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10, rule 13)<br>
RETRACTABLE ROOF FOR PASSENGER VEHICLES, ESPECIALLY A HARD TOP FOR CONVERTIBLES, ROADSTERS OR SIMILAR<br>
PERAKIS, PETROS of KANTSTRASSE 131,  1062 5 BERLIN, GERMANY, GERMAN National<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br>
RETRACTABLE ROOF FOR PASSENGER VEHICLES, ESPECIALLY A HABD TOP FOR CONVERTIBLES, ROADSTERS OR SIMILAR<br>
The invention relates to a retractable roof for passenger verhicles, especially a hard top for two-seater convertibles, roadsters, or similar, the roof having a rigid shell that has a main roof part and columns projecting fixedly downward at an obtuse angle from the rear of the main part, a rear window for a window opening, a storage compartment extending transversely of the vehicle axis immediately behind the seats and into which the main part and columns and the rear window and their guide and drive means are engageable, the main roof part with its columns being guided cinematically on a track into its storage compartment.<br>
German 36 342 058 and EP 0,261,379 describe a closable roof for a car having a one  piece rigid and stable roof element having when raised a generally horizontal upper roof region and side parts extending downwardly and back relative to the car and a pair of pivots on each of the two side parts or the rear of thee roof that in a raised position of the roof are spaced apart somewhat below the vehicle body and that have a pair guide rails symmetrically on each of the two sides of the vehicle in which the pivots engage. The two guide rails of each pair have their upper ends spaced apart with the respective pivots and extend from there downward along similar paths so that their spacing decreases going down so as to produce an opening movement where the upper roof part is raised and then on further movement is dropped while generally vertical into its lower end position. The pivots in a first movement phase are moved in the guide rails downwardly along an arc so that the roof tips up with the upper roof part and the rear part pivots downward. The two rails that are fixed inside the car on the inside and that guide projections of the side parts via their pivots takes up quite a bit of space behind the seats and into the trunk area. Furthermore canting of the various guide elements is possible as a result of the difficult force distribution during opening and closing.<br>
German 43 24 708 discloses a lowerable roof for cars, in particular for two-seater convertibles, having a shell forming a roof plate and rear roof posts<br>
2<br><br>
and movable into a storage compartment between side walls of the vehicle body to which end it is oriented in a vehicle plane, forming a window opening for a rear window between a rear edge of the roof plate and the posts, and provided with guides for moving the roof plate and rear window so that the rear window can move from a lowered position relative to the roof plate into a lower position in which its edges are closely juxtaposed with the roof plate. The roof shell can drop down in lateral storage compartments via guides that are independent of the guides of the rear window and longitudinally slidable in the roof shell.<br>
The two guide rails on the inner wall of the car that guide pivots or pins take up a great deal of space behind the seat and into the trunk area. In addition canting of the various guide elements is possible as a result of how the forces are applied during opening and closing. High surface pressures are created that make it difficult to operate the roof.<br>
In addition German 40 38 074 describes a lowerable roof for cars, in particular a hard roof for a convertible, having roof posts to each side of a rear window of the roof that seen from the side with a storage position of the lower roof in a storage compartment in which the forward longitudinal regions of the roof form an obtuse angle underneath the roof posts and into which the roof can be lowered in which case the roof is tipped into the storage compartment. The rear window forms with the roof raised between the roof posts the rear part of the roof and can be moved from this position into a storage position in which with the roof lowered it is stowed above the lower ends of the roof posts. The roof is mounted on the rotor-vehicle body by a pair of linkages that symmetrically flank the vehicle centre plane and whose upper ends are pivoted at lower ends of the roof posts and that each include at least one guide link extending along an angled line to the rear window that is pivoted at its upper edge on the roof and at its lower end on thee body of the vehicle. With this known solution parts of the passenger compartment are taken up by the lowering and raising process as a result of the relatively bulky linkages. The linkages are also mechanically expensive and failure-prone.<br>
3<br><br>
US 2,191,2690 describes a lowerable roof without rear posts for a convertible, wherein a raising and lowering mechanism formed by large and small rollers is provide that extends behind and partially below the seats. The raising and lowering mechanism is very likely to jam as a result of the roller drive and takes up all the space behind the seats.<br>
All the known lowerable roof of the prior art achieve the required structural rigidity by being relatively massive, and are mechanically complex and expensive.<br>
It is an object of the invention, in view of this state of the art, to improve on a lowerable roof of the above-described type such that the necessaiy structural rigidity is achieved with less weight, easier operation, and more mechanical simplicity and usability while also taking up less space.<br>
This object is achieved by a roof of the above-described type having the features of the characterizing clause of claim 1. Preferred embodiments of the roof are seen in the dependent claims.<br>
The roof according to the invention is characterized in that as a result of a simplification of the kinematics of the guiding of the roof part parallel to the vehicle axis along the rear quarter panels there is sufficient room for the storage compartment with its columns immediately behind the rear seat. The roof according to the invention only needs for each column a straight guide rail extending toward the trunk along upper region of each rear quarter panel and a control track. In this manner space and weight are conserved.<br>
The roof according to the invention can, in spite of its small mass, be structurally quite stiff, and provides when closed the same comfort as a hard-top coupe. It saves space, is easy to use and service, and does not interfere with visibility toward the rear.<br>

Fig. 13 is a perspective view of a storage compartment.<br>
Example 1:<br>
Fig. 1 shows by way of example a two-seater convertible having according to the invention a roof 1. It is comprised of a rigid shell forming a front main part 2 from whose rear corners two support columns 3 extend downward at an<br><br>
5<br><br>
obtuse angle, diverging outwardly. The support columns 3 are narrow and flat and mainly act as supports. Lower ends 4 of these columns 3 are fixed to respective guide slides 5 that have rollers or slide pads. The guide slides 5 make four-point contact with rails 6 that are fixed on support plates 7 oriented vertically and extending parallel to the vehicle longitudinal axis. Each support column 3 is guided only on one rail 6 by one guide slide 5 that moves in a straight line on the rail 6. The rails 6 have hard surfaces so they are wear resistant, and they define straight guide paths FB that extend parallel to the vehicle longitudinal axis along upper regions of the rear quarter panels 9. The lower end 4 of each column 3 carries a pin 19. These pins 19 ride in control tracks 20 that are fixed to plates 21 that extend parallel to the support plates 7. The control tracks 20 each have a straight part and a curved part, behind the seats 10 the roof can fit into a storage compartment 11 that according to the invention has a shape determined by the movement arc of the roof part 2 and the columns 3 during lowering and raising.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the start of the horizontal sliding of the roof part 2 with its columns 2. Both guide slides 5 move along the respective rails 6 toward the rear stops 12. The pins 19 are pulled by inextensible entraining elements, for example steel chains, along the tracks 20. So long as the pins are in the straight track part, the roof moves purely in a straight line. This part extends of the passenger compartment and a roll bar 28. As the pins 19 move into and travel along the curved track part, the roof is pivots about the axis A of the slides so that the roof part 2 is swung or pivoted downward into the storage compartment 11. The roof part is positioned at the end of its downward travel in an upright position behind the back of the seats 10.<br>
Fig. 6a shows a variant of the guide slide 5 with four rollers 15, the slide being at the column foot. Fig. 6b shows a further variant in which the slide is integrated into the column foot.<br>
The rails 6 and the tracks 20 each lie as shown in Figs. 7a and 7b in the bottom of a compartment 14 of the upper rear quarter panel 9, on whose outer vertical wall 15 formed by the support plate 7 the rail 6 is secured and whose on inner vertical support plates 21 the track 20 is secured. The compartment 14 is dimensioned such that the columns 3 fit in it when the roof part 2 is lowered into the compartment 14.<br>
6<br><br>
Figs. 8a and 8b show the straight-line and pivotal movement of the roof part 2 with its columns 3. The guide slides 5 move along the rails 6 and pass through points Fl to F8. The pins 19 ride in the tracks 20, pass through the points SI through S8, and are attached to the entrainment element 13.<br>
On lowering, the pins move from point SI via point S2 to point S3. This part of the control track is straight and parallel to the rails 6. The slides 5 at the same time move through points Fl, F2, and F3, with the roof moving in a straight line parallel to the vehicle longitudinal axis. Simultaneously the front roof edge moves through points VI, V2, and V3. It passes the passenger compartment and the roll bar fixed on the vehicle body.<br>
The curved part of the control track 20 starts at point S3. The pins move between the points S3 and S5 along a path that vertically converges with the control track. The slide 5 moves through the points F3 to P5. The roof thus pivots downward about the axis A while also moving translatorily. lire roof front edge at this time traverses points V3 to V5. The point S5 is the rear end of the control track 20. As soon as the pins pass this point, the slides 5 have reached the stop points 12 and the roof moves purely pivotally. As the pin moves further to the point S8, the slide 5 moves forward through points F5 through F8. The front roof edge dips in a combination pivoting straight-line movement into the storage compartment 12. This movement conforms to the shape of the roof and allows the storage compartment 11 to be optimally minimized in size. The points Fl to F8 are the momentary positions of the pivot axis of the slide 5.<br>
Figs. 8b and 9 show the endless entrainment elements 13, here steel chains, spanned over sprockets 23 that are connected together by a common shaft 25 and driven by a motor 24. Tipping of the roof part 2 about the pivot axis A facilitates good force transmission to the slide 5 via the pin 20 over the entire path of travel.<br>
The rear window 16 is pivotal at a rear edge of the roof shell about<br>
7<br><br>
a horizontal transverse axis B and is of downwardly flaring trapezoidal shape and planar. It can as shown in Fig. 5 be pivoted up into a windshield position when the roof is down. The roof 1 fits with its front edge with the upper frame of the windshield. Actuation of the roof 1 is effected by standard drives and can be wholly automatic. In its raised position the columns 3 of roof 1 are also supported by braces 17. These braces 17 are pivotal, swingable, or hinged on the vehicle body. The braces 17 optimize aerodynamics, reduce wind resistance and wind noise, and impart a coupe-like look to the vehicle.<br>
In order that the roof part 2 when lowered leaves sufficient room for an unillustrated drive, a front region 22 of the roof part 2 slides under a rear part of the roof part 2. The slidable part of the roof part and its support structure are wade rotation symmetrical to a horizontal transverse axis of the vehicle so that the guide elements can be made very compact and light.<br>
Figs. 10 and 11 show a variant in which the rear part of the roof part 2 carries the roll bar 18. The rear window 16 can also be swung up in this system for windscreen use when the roof is down. When the roof 1 is up, the rear window 16 bears against a seal that is mounted on the vehicle body. The rear window 16 itself can alternatively be provided with the seal.<br>
Example 2.<br>
Fig. 12 shows a longitudinal section through a convertible with a roll bar integrated into the rear part of the roof, the columns being transversely connected to form a bend- and torsion-resistant U-shaped frame on which the roof part 2 is pivoted about a horizontal transverse axis C. This variant makes it possible to substantially shorten the lengths of the rails 6 and to make the storage compartment for the roof substantially smaller. To this end the columns 3 are inclined at a larger angle to the axis A than in example 1.<br>
A plurality of pins 19 travelling in respective guide slots 20 ensure good transmission of drive force to the slides 5. In each position at least one pin 19<br>
8<br><br>
ensures good transmission of the driving force at the axis A. Pivoting of the roof is effected by the columns 3 acting as links between the transverse axes A and C. Other than these difference, the roof according to the invention corresponds to that of example 1.<br>
Fig. 13 shows the storage compartment in perspective view, with the position of the support plates 21 for the tracks 20 and the vertical inner walls of the compartment 7 for the columns 3.<br>
