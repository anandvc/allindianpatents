RELATED APPLICATIONS<br><br>
[01] This application claims priority to co-pending prior application U.S. Serial No. 11/962,299, filed on December 21, 2007, and also claims priority to co-pending prior application U.S. Serial No. 11/686,120, filed March 14, 2007, both of which are entitled, "Beverage Products Having Steviol Glycosides and at Least One Acid," the entire disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
[02] This invention relates to beverages and other beverage products, such as beverage concentrates, etc. In particular, this invention relates to beverages and other beverage products having formulations incorporating non-nutritive sweeteners and being suitable to meet market demand for alternative nutritional characteristics or flavor profiles in beverages.<br><br>
BACKGROUND<br><br>
[03] It has long been known to produce beverages of various formulations. Improved and new formulations are desirable to meet changing market demands. In particular, there is perceived market demand for beverages having alternative nutritional characteristics, including, for example, alternative calorie content. Also, there is perceived market demand for beverages having alternative flavor profiles, including good taste and mouthfeel. In addition, there is consumer interest in beverages and other beverage products, such as beverage concentrates, etc. whose formulations make greater use of natural ingredients, that is, ingredients distilled, extracted, concentrated or similarly obtained from harvested plants and other naturally occurring sources, with limited or no further processing. <br><br>
[04] The development of new beverage formulations, for example, new beverage formulations employing alternative sweeteners, flavorants, flavor enhancing agents and the like, presents challenges in addressing associated bitterness and/or other off- tastes. In addition, such challenges typically are presented in new beverage formulations developed for alternative nutritional and/or flavor profiles. Also, there is need for new beverage formulations which can satisfactorily meet the combination of objectives including nutritional characteristics, flavor, shelf life, and other objectives.<br><br>
[05] Development of new beverage formulations has faced obstacles. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,956,191 suggests that carbonated beverages which contain blends of saccharin or the Stevia extract with aspartame tend to be less organoleptically pleasing than those containing sugar.<br><br>
[06] It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide beverages and other beverage products. It is an object of at least certain embodiments of the invention (that is, not necessarily all embodiments of the invention) to provide beverages and other beverage products having desirable taste properties. It is an object of at least certain (but not necessarily all) embodiments of the invention to provide beverages and other beverage products having improved formulations. These and other objects, features and advantages of the invention or of certain embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following disclosure and description of exemplary embodiments.<br><br>

[13] It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, given the benefit of the following description of certain exemplary embodiments of the beverage and other beverage products disclosed here, that at least certain embodiments of the invention have improved or alternative formulations suitable to provide desirable taste profiles, nutritional characteristics, etc. These and other aspects, features and advantages of the invention or of certain embodiments of the invention will be further understood by those skilled in the art from the following description of exemplary embodiments.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br><br>
[14] It should be understood that beverages and other beverage products in accordance with this disclosure may have any of numerous different specific formulations or constitutions. The formulation of a beverage product in accordance with this disclosure may vary to a certain extent, depending upon such factors as the product's intended market segment, its desired nutritional characteristics, flavor profile and the like. For example, it will generally be an option to add further ingredients to the formulation of a particular beverage embodiment, including any of the beverage formulations described below. Additional (i.e., more and/or other) sweeteners may be added, flavorings, electrolytes, vitamins, fruit juices or other fruit products, tastents, masking agents and the like, flavor enhancers, and/or carbonation typically may be added to any such formulations to vary the taste, mouthfeel, nutritional characteristics, etc. In general, a beverage in accordance with this disclosure typically comprises at least water, sweetener, acidulant and flavoring. Exemplary flavorings which may be suitable for at least certain formulations in accordance with this disclosure include cola flavoring, citrus flavoring, spice flavorings and others. Carbonation in the form of carbon dioxide may be added for effervescence. Preservatives may be added if desired, depending upon the other ingredients, production technique, desired shelf life, etc. Optionally, caffeine may be added. Certain exemplary embodiments of the beverages disclosed here are cola-flavored carbonated beverages, characteristically containing carbonated water, sweetener, kola nut extract and/or other flavoring, <br><br>
caramel coloring, phosphoric acid, and optionally other ingredients. Additional and alternative suitable ingredients will be recognized by those skilled in the art given the benefit of this disclosure.<br><br>
[15] The beverage products disclosed here include beverages, i.e., ready to drink liquid formulations, beverage concentrates and the like. Beverages include, e.g., carbonated and non-carbonated soft drinks, fountain beverages, frozen ready-to-drink beverages, coffee beverages, tea beverages, dairy beverages, powdered soft drinks, as well as liquid concentrates, flavored waters, enhanced waters, fruit juice and fruit juice- flavored drinks, sport drinks, and alcoholic products. The terms "beverage concentrate" and "syrup" are used interchangeably throughout this disclosure. At least certain exemplary embodiments of the beverage concentrates contemplated are prepared with an initial volume of water to which the additional ingredients are added. Full strength beverage compositions may be formed from the beverage concentrate by adding further volumes of water to the concentrate. Typically, for example, full strength beverages may be prepared from the concentrates by combining approximately 1 part concentrate with between approximately 3 to approximately 7 parts water. In certain exemplary embodiments the full strength beverage is prepared by combining 1 part concentrate with 5 parts water. In certain exemplary embodiments the additional water used to form the full strength beverages is carbonated water. In certain other embodiments, a full strength beverage is directly prepared without the formation of a concentrate and subsequent dilution.<br><br>
[16] Natural embodiments of the beverage products disclosed here are natural in that they do not contain anything artificial or synthetic (including any color additives regardless of source) that would not normally be expected to be in the food. As used herein, therefore, a "natural" beverage composition is defined in accordance with the following guidelines: Raw materials for a natural ingredient exists or originates in nature. Biological synthesis involving fermentation and enzymes can be employed, but synthesis with chemical reagents is not utilized. Artificial colors, preservatives, and flavors are not considered natural ingredients. Ingredients may be processed or purified through certain specified techniques including at least: physical processes, fermentation, and enzymolysis. Appropriate processes and purification techniques include at least: absorption, adsorption, agglomeration, centrifugation, chopping, <br><br>
cooking (baking, frying, boiling, roasting), cooling, cutting, chromatography, coating, crystallization, digestion, drying (spray, freeze drying, vacuum), evaporation, distillation, electrophoresis, emulsification, encapsulation, extraction, extrusion, filtration, fermentation, grinding, infusion, maceration, microbiological (rennet, enzymes), mixing, peeling, percolation, refrigeration/freezing, squeezing, steeping, washing, heating, mixing, ion exchange, lyophilization, osmose, precipitation, salting out, sublimation, ultrasonic treatment, concentration, flocculation, homogenization, reconstitution, enzymolysis (using enzymes found in nature). Processing aids (currently defined as substances used as manufacturing aids to enhance the appeal or utility of a food component, including clarifying agents, catalysts, flocculants, filter aids, and crystallization inhibitors, etc. See 21 CFR § 170.3(o)(24)) are considered incidental additives and may be used if removed appropriately.<br><br>
[17] Water is a basic ingredient in the beverage products disclosed here, typically being the vehicle or primary liquid portion in which the remaining ingredients are dissolved, emulsified, suspended or dispersed. Purified water can be used in the manufacture of certain embodiments of the beverages disclosed here, and water of a standard beverage quality can be employed in order not to adversely affect beverage taste, odor, or appearance. The water typically will be clear, colorless, free from objectionable minerals, tastes and odors, free from organic matter, low in alkalinity and of acceptable microbiological quality based on industry and government standards applicable at the time of producing the beverage. In certain typical embodiments, water is present at a level of from about 80% to about 99.9% by weight of the beverage. In at least certain exemplary embodiments the water used in beverages and concentrates disclosed here is "treated water," which refers to water that has been treated to reduce the total dissolved solids of the water prior to optional supplementation, e.g., with calcium as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 7,052,725. Methods of producing treated water are known to those of ordinary skill in the art and include deionization, distillation, filtration and reverse osmosis ("r-o"), among others. The terms "treated water," "purified water,", "demineralized water," "distilled water," and "r-o water" are understood to be generally synonymous in this discussion, referring to water from which substantially all mineral content has been removed, <br><br>
typically containing no more than about 500 ppm total dissolved solids, e.g. 250 ppm total dissolved solids.<br><br>
[18] The steviol glycoside include, e.g., rebaudiosides, such as rebaudioside A, stevioside, and related compounds for sweetening. These compounds may be obtained by extraction or the like from the stevia plant. Stevia (e.g., Stevia rebaudiana bectoni) is a sweet-tasting plant. The leaves contain a complex mixture of natural sweet diterpene glycosides. Steviol glycosides and rebaudiosides are components of Stevia that contribute sweetness. Typically, these compounds are found to include stevioside (4-13% dry weight), steviolbioside (trace), the rebaudiosides, including rebaudioside A (2-4%), rebaudioside B (trace), rebaudioside C (1-2%), rebaudioside D (trace), and rebaudioside E (trace), and dulcoside A (0.4-0.7%). The following nonsweet constituents also have been identified in the leaves of stevia plants: labdane, diterpene, triterpenes, sterols, flavonoids, volatile oil constituents, pigments, gums and inorganic matter. Generally, the beverage products disclosed herein may include at least one steviol glycoside, for example, rebaudioside A, rebaudioside B, rebaudioside C, rebaudioside D, rebaudioside E, stevioside, steviolbioside, dulcoside A, a Stevia rebaudiana extract, or mixtures of any of them.<br><br>
[19] The at least one acid used in the beverages products disclosed herein may serve any one or more of several functions, including, for example, lending tartness to the taste of the beverage, enhancing palatability, increasing thirst quenching effect, modifying sweetness and acting as a mild preservative. Suitable acids are known and will be apparent to those skilled in the art given the benefit of this disclosure. Exemplary acids suitable for use in some or all embodiments of the beverage products disclosed here include phosphoric acid, citric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, fumaric acid, ascorbic acid, gluconic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, adipic acid, cinnamic acid, glutaric acid, and mixtures of any of them. Typically, the acid is phosphoric acid, citric acid, malic acid, or combinations thereof such as phosphoric acid and citric acid.<br><br>
[20] Titratable acidity is an indication of the total acidity of a beverage product. Titratable acidity measures the amount of alkali required to neutralize the acid of a given volume of beverage. The titratable acidity is the millimeter of 0.1 N NaOH required to titrate 100 ml of beverage to a pH 8.75 end point with a potentiometer. The <br><br>
titratable acidity of the beverage comprising at least one steviol glycoside and at least one acid is typically about 8 to about 12, more typically about 9 to about 11. Suitable amounts include, e.g., about 9, 9.5, or 10. The titratable acidity of the beverage product comprising rebaudioside A, erythritol, and at least one acid is typically about 8.75 to about 10.5, preferably about 9 to about 10. Suitable titratable acidities include, e.g., about 9, 9.25, 9.5, 9.75, 10, or 10.25.<br><br>
[21] The acid may be used in solution form, for example, and in an amount sufficient to provide the desired pH of the beverage. The particular acid or acids chosen and the amount used will depend, in part, on the other ingredients, the desired shelf life of the beverage product, as well as effects on the beverage pH, titratable acidity, and taste. Typically, for example, the one or more acids of the acidulant are used in an amount, collectively, of from about 0.01% to about 1.0% by weight of the beverage, e.g., from about 0.01% to about 0.5% by weight, from about 0.05% to about 0.5% by weight, from about 0.05% to about 0.25% by weight, from about 0.1% to about 0.25% by weight, depending upon the acidulant used, desired pH, other ingredients used, etc. The pH of at least certain exemplary embodiments of the beverages disclosed here may be a value within the range of from about 2.0 to about 5.0, e.g., about 2.8 to about 3.3, about 2.8 to about 3.1, about 3.0 to about 3.2, or 3.1. The acid in certain exemplary embodiments enhances beverage flavor. Too much acid may impair the beverage flavor and result in tartness or other off-taste, while too little acid may make the beverage taste flat.<br><br>
[22] Those skilled in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure, will recognize that when preparing beverage products containing sweeteners in addition to the steviol glycoside such as peptide-based artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, the resulting beverage composition is best maintained below a certain pH to retain the sweetening effect of the artificial sweetener. In the formation of calcium- supplemented beverages, the presence of calcium salts increases the pH which requires additional acids to both assist the dissolution of the salt and maintain a desirable pH for stability of the artificial sweetener. The presence of the additional acid in the beverage composition, which increases the titratable acidity of the composition, will result in a more tart or sour taste to the resulting beverage. It will be within the ability of those skilled in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure, to select a suitable acid or combination of <br><br>
acids and the amounts of such acids for the acidulant component of any particular embodiment of the beverage products disclosed here.<br><br>
[23] In addition to rebaudioside A and erythritol, optionally additional sweetener may be used in the beverage produced disclosed herein. Such optional additional sweeteners suitable for use in various exemplary embodiments of beverage products comprising rebaudioside A, erythritol, and at least one acid include natural and artificial or synthetic sweeteners. Suitable sweeteners and combinations of sweeteners are selected for the desired nutritional characteristics, taste profile for the beverage, mouthfeel and other organoleptic factors. As used herein, "taste" refers to a combination of sweetness perception, temporal effects of sweetness perception, i.e., on-set and duration, off-tastes, e.g. bitterness and metallic taste, residual perception (aftertaste) and tactile perception, e.g. body and thickness. As used herein, a "full- calorie" beverage formulation is one fully sweetened with a nutritive sweetener. The term "nutritive sweetener" refers generally to sweeteners which provide significant caloric content in typical usage amounts, e.g., more than about 5 calories per 8 oz. serving of beverage. As used herein, a "potent sweetener" means a sweetener which is at least twice as sweet as sugar, that is, a sweetener which on a weight basis requires no more than half the weight of sugar to achieve an equivalent sweetness. For example, a potent sweetener may require less than one-half the weight of sugar to achieve an equivalent sweetness in a beverage sweetened to a level of 10 degrees Brix with sugar. Potent sweeteners include both nutritive (e.g., Lo Han Guo juice concentrate) and non-nutritive sweeteners (e.g., typically, Lo Han Guo powder). In addition, potent sweeteners include both natural potent sweeteners (e.g., steviol glycosides, Lo Han Guo, etc.) and artificial potent sweeteners (e.g., neotame, etc.). However, for natural beverage products disclosed here, only natural potent sweeteners are employed. Commonly accepted potency figures for certain potent sweeteners include, for example,<br><br>
Cyclamate 30 times as sweet as sugar<br><br>
Stevioside 100-250 times as sweet as sugar<br><br>
Mogroside V 100-300 times as sweet as sugar<br><br>
Rebaudioside A 150-300 times as sweet as sugar <br><br>
Acesulfame-K 200 times as sweet as sugar<br><br>
Aspartame 200 times as sweet as sugar<br><br>
Saccharin 300 times as sweet as sugar<br><br>
Neohesperidin dihydrochalcone 300 times as sweet as sugar Sucralose 600 times as sweet as sugar<br><br>
Neotame 8,000 times as sweet as sugar<br><br>
[24] Sweeteners suitable for at least certain exemplary embodiments include, for example, sugar alcohols such as sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, lactitol, isomalt, and malitol. Other sweeteners include tagatose, e.g., D-tagatose, and combinations of tagatose with the sugar alcohol erythritol. In certain exemplary embodiments, the beverage products disclosed herein comprise erythritol in the range of about 1.0% to about 4.5% by weight of the beverage, e.g., about 2.5% to about 3.5% by weight, or about 2.8% to about 3.5% by weight.<br><br>
[25] As further discussed below, exemplary natural nutritive sweeteners suitable for some or all embodiments of the beverage products disclosed here include crystalline or liquid sucrose, fructose, glucose, dextrose, maltose, trehalose, fructo-oligosaccharides, glucose-fructose syrup from natural sources such as apple, chicory, honey, etc., e.g., high fructose corn syrup, invert sugar and the like and mixtures of any of them; exemplary artificial sweeteners suitable for some or all embodiments of the beverages disclosed here include saccharin, cyclamate, aspartame, other dipeptides, acesulfame potassium, and other such potent sweeteners, and mixtures of any of them; and exemplary natural non-nutritive potent sweeteners suitable for some or all embodiments of the beverages disclosed here include steviol glycosides (e.g., stevioside, steviolbioside, dulcoside A, rebaudioside A, rebaudioside B, rebaudioside C, rebaudioside D, rebaudioside E, mixtures of any of them, etc.) and Lo Han Guo and related compounds, and mixtures of any of them. Lo Han Guo is a potent sweetener which can be provided as a natural nutritive or natural non-nutritive sweetener. For example, Lo Han Guo juice concentrate may be a nutritive sweetener, and Lo Han Guo powder may be a non-nutritive sweetener. Also, in at least certain exemplary embodiments of the beverages disclosed here, combinations of one or <br><br>
more natural nutritive sweeteners, one or more artificial sweeteners and/or one or more natural non-nutritive potent sweeteners are used to provide the sweetness and other aspects of desired taste profile and nutritive characteristics. It should also be recognized that certain such sweeteners will, either in addition or instead, act as tastents, masking agents or the like in various embodiments of the beverages disclosed here, e.g., when used in amounts below its (or their) sweetness perception threshold in the beverage in question.<br><br>
[26] The sweeteners included in the formulations of the beverage products disclosed here are edible consumables suitable for consumption and for use in beverages. By "edible consumables" is meant a food or beverage or an ingredient of a food or beverage for human or animal consumption. The sweetener or sweetening agent used here and in the claims may be a nutritive or non-nutritive, natural or synthetic beverage ingredient or additive (or mixtures of them) which provides sweetness to the beverage, i.e., which is perceived as sweet by the sense of taste. The perception of flavoring agents and sweetening agents may depend to some extent on the interrelation of elements. Flavor and sweetness may also be perceived separately, i.e., flavor and sweetness perception may be both dependent upon each other and independent of each other. For example, when a large amount of a flavoring agent is used, a small amount of a sweetening agent may be readily perceptible and vice versa. Thus, the oral and olfactory interaction between a flavoring agent and a sweetening agent may involve the interrelationship of elements.<br><br>
[27] In at least certain exemplary embodiments of beverage products comprising rebaudioside A, erythritol, and at least one acid disclosed here, the sweetener component may include as an optional additional sweetener, nutritive, natural crystalline or liquid sweeteners such as sucrose, liquid sucrose, fructose, liquid fructose, glucose, liquid glucose, glucose-fructose syrup from natural sources such as apple, chicory, honey, etc., e.g., high fructose corn syrup, invert sugar, maple syrup, maple sugar, honey, brown sugar molasses, e.g., cane molasses, such as first molasses, second molasses, blackstrap molasses, and sugar beet molasses, sorghum syrup, and/or others. Such sweeteners are present in at least certain exemplary embodiments in an amount of from about 0.1% to about 20% by weight of the beverage, such as from about 6% to about 16% by weight, depending upon the desired <br><br>
level of sweetness for the beverage. To achieve desired beverage uniformity, texture and taste, in certain exemplary embodiments of the natural beverage products disclosed here, standardized liquid sugars as are commonly employed in the beverage industry can be used. Typically such standardized sweeteners are free of traces of nonsugar solids which could adversely affect the flavor, color or consistency of the beverage.<br><br>
[28] The term "nutritive sweetener" refers generally to sweeteners which provide significant caloric content in typical usage amounts, e.g., more than about 5 calories per 8 oz. serving of beverage. As used herein, a "full-calorie" beverage formulation is one fully sweetened with a nutritive sweetener. As used herein, a "non-nutritive sweetener" is one which does not provide significant caloric content in typical usage amounts, i.e., is one which imparts less than 5 calories per 8 oz. serving of beverage to achieve the sweetness equivalent of 10 Brix of sugar. As used herein, "reduced calorie beverage" means a beverage having at least a 25% reduction in calories per 8 oz. serving of beverage as compared to the full calorie version, typically a previously commercialized full-calorie version. As used herein, a "low-calorie beverage" has fewer than 40 calories per 8 oz. serving of beverage. As used herein, "zero-calorie" or "diet" means having less than 5 calories per serving, e.g., per 8 oz. for beverages.<br><br>
[29] Artificial and natural non-nutritive potent sweeteners are suitable for use in at least certain exemplary embodiments of the beverages comprising at least one steviol glycoside and at least one acid disclosed here.

[42] Preservatives may be used in at least certain embodiments of the beverages disclosed here. That is, at least certain exemplary embodiments contain an optional dissolved preservative system. Solutions with a pH below 4 and especially those below 3 typically are "microstable," i.e., they resist growth of microorganisms, and so are suitable for longer term storage prior to consumption without the need for further preservatives. However, an additional preservative system may be used if desired. If a preservative system is used, it may be added to the beverage product at any suitable time during production, e.g., in some cases prior to the addition of the sweetener. As used here, the terms "preservation system" or "preservatives" include all suitable preservatives approved for use in food and beverage compositions, including, without <br><br>
limitation, such known chemical preservatives as benzoates, e.g., sodium, calcium, and potassium benzoate, sorbates, e.g., sodium, calcium, and potassium sorbate, citrates, e.g., sodium citrate and potassium citrate, polyphosphates, e.g., sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP), and mixtures thereof, and antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, EDTA, BHA, BHT, TBHQ, dehydroacetic acid, dimethyldicarbonate, ethoxyquin, heptylparaben, and combinations thereof. Preservatives may be used in amounts not exceeding mandated maximum levels under applicable laws and regulations. The level of preservative used typically is adjusted according to the planned final product pH, as well as an evaluation of the microbiological spoilage potential of the particular beverage formulation. The maximum level employed typically is about 0.05% by weight of the beverage. It will be within the ability of those skilled in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure, to select a suitable preservative or combination of preservatives for beverages according to this disclosure.<br><br>
[43] Other methods of beverage preservation suitable for at least certain exemplary embodiments of the beverage products disclosed here include, e.g., aseptic packaging and/or heat treatment or thermal processing steps, such as hot filling and tunnel pasteurization. Such steps can be used to reduce yeast, mold and microbial growth in the beverage products. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,830,862 to Braun et al. discloses the use of pasteurization in the production of fruit juice beverages as well as the use of suitable preservatives in carbonated beverages. U.S. Patent No. 4,925,686 to Kastin discloses a heat-pasteurized freezable fruit juice composition which contains sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate. In general, heat treatment includes hot fill methods typically using high temperatures for a short time, e.g., about 190° F for 10 seconds, tunnel pasteurization methods typically using lower temperatures for a longer time, e.g., about 160° F for 10-15 minutes, and retort methods typically using, e.g., about 250° F for 3-5 minutes at elevated pressure, i.e., at pressure above 1 atmosphere. <br><br>
EXAMPLES<br><br>
[44] The following examples are specific embodiments of the present invention but are not intended to limit it.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 1<br><br>
[45] Beverages according to this disclosure are prepared with the following formulations. Specifically, diet colas containing natural sweeteners were formulated at three different TA levels (12, 10, and 9). At TA of 12, a common level for colas, the diet cola is tart and with bitter taste. At the lower TA level, especially at 9, diet cola having a proper sweet/tart ratio with an increased sweetness and reduced tartness was achieved. The bitterness perception was lessened.<br><br>
TABLE 1<br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 2<br><br>
Beverages according to this disclosure are prepared with the following formulations. In Table 2, the bitterness of Rebaudioside A is significantly reduced for the diet cola Formula 2 when the citric acid is removed from the formula 1.<br><br>
TABLE 2<br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 3<br><br>
Water solutions containing natural sweeteners and caffeine are prepared with the following formulations. Table 3 shows that the bitterness of Rebaudiaoside A for formula 1 is significantly reduced as shown in Formula 2 when the caffeine is removed from formula 1.<br><br>
TABLE 3<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 4<br><br>
Table 4 shows that the bitterness of Rebaudiaoside A in Formula 2 is further reduced in a caffeine free flavorless cola beverage base containing single strength caramel.<br><br>
TABLE 4<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 5<br><br>
Reduced calorie beverages according to this disclosure are prepared with the following formulations: <br><br>
TABLE 5<br><br><br>
[46] Table 5 shows that the taste of reduced calorie cola beverages containing sucrose, erythritol and Lo Han Guo juice concentrate is improved at the lower TA for formula<br><br>
3. <br><br>
[47] The beverages of these examples illustrate the following benefits:<br><br>
1. Lower the TA from the original 12 to 9 to achieve a proper sweet/tart ratio to increase sweetness and to reduce tartness and bitterness of beverages made with natural sweeteners.<br><br>
2. Removing caffeine and also citric acid from the formulas can further reduce the bitterness of rebaudiaoside A<br><br>
3. Flavors and coloring ( e.g. Single strength caramel ) in cola formulas may also play a role in controlling the bitter taste of rebaudiaoside A<br><br>
[48] Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that, for convenience, some ingredients are described here in certain cases by reference to the original form of the ingredient in which it is used in formulating or producing the beverage product. Such original form of the ingredient may differ from the form in which the ingredient is found in the finished beverage product. Thus, for example, in certain exemplary embodiments of the beverage products according to this disclosure, sucrose and liquid sucrose would typically be substantially homogenously dissolved and dispersed in the beverage. Likewise, other ingredients identified as a solid, concentrate (e.g., juice concentrate), etc. would typically be homogenously dispersed throughout the beverage or throughout the beverage concentrate, rather than remaining in their original form. Thus, reference to the form of an ingredient of a beverage product formulation should not be taken as a limitation on the form of the ingredient in the beverage product, but rather as a convenient means of describing the ingredient as an isolated component of the product formulation.<br><br>
[49] Given the benefit of the above disclosure and description of exemplary embodiments, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that numerous alternative and different embodiments are possible in keeping with the general principles of the invention disclosed here. Those skilled in this art will recognize that all such various modifications and alternative embodiments are within the true scope and spirit of the invention. The appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and alternative embodiments. It should be understood that the use of a singular indefinite or definite article (e.g., "a," "an," "the," etc.) in this disclosure and in the following claims follows the traditional approach in patents of meaning "at least one" unless in a <br><br>
particular instance it is clear from context that the term is intended in that particular instance to mean specifically one and only one. Likewise, the term "comprising" is open ended, not excluding additional items, features, components, etc. <br><br>
