				<td>USE OF BENZOTRIAZOLE DERIVATIVES FOR PHOTOSTABILISATION Use of benzotriazole derivatives<br>
The present invention relates to the use of specific benzotriazole derivatives for enhancing the photostability of sunscreen compositions.<br>
There is a growing need for effective topical sun protection preparations in order to prevent the damaging effects of UV light on human skin, for example sunburn, photo-allergic reactions, premature ageing of the skin and skin cancer. Most sun protection preparations now provide good protection against ultraviolet radiation in the wavelength range from 290 to 320 nm (UV-B range).<br>
Numerous studies in recent years have shown that ultraviolet radiation in the wavelength range from 320 to 400 nm (UV-A range) makes a significant contribution to the skin damage caused by sunlight. Therefore an increasing requirement for adequate protection against UVA radiation exists. In addition, the availability of sun protection preparations having a high sun protection factor (hereinafter also referred to as SPF) has led to concerns that users are able to stay in the sun for longer and, as a result, are exposed to an increased amount of UVA radiation.<br>
A UV filter should ideally convert absorbed UV radiation quickly and efficiently into harmless thermal energy without degradation of its protective action and any negative effects in the sunscreen preparations.<br>
Although there is a large choice of suitable UVB filters good UVA absorbers are rare because they are mostly of low activity or of inadequate photostability. In particular, dibenzoyl-methane derivatives, for example 4-tert-butyl-4*-methoxydibenzoylmethane, the most common UVA filter, which is availabel under the trade name Parsol 1789 are degraded relatively quickly under the action of sunlight and, as a result, lose their protective action (R. M. Sayre et ai, Allured's Cosmetics &amp; Toiletries, 114 (5): 85-91, 1999). In addition, it is known that the photostable UVB filters cinnamic acid esters, such as octyl methoxycinnamate which is available under the tradename Parsol MCX are frequently used in combination with dibenzoylme-thane derivatives. They may, however, form cycloaddition products with the dibenzoylme-thane derivative in a photoreaction processand consequently become destabilised.<br><br>
As a result the photostability of the combination of these UV filters is decreased significantly.<br>
Surprisingly it was found that specific benzotirazole derivatives may enhance the photostability of UV absorber systems comprising further organic UV absorbers like cinnamic acid esters or dibenzolymethan derivatives or combinations thereof.<br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to the use of benzotriazole derivatives of formula<br><br>
R3   is hydrogen; C1-C5alkyI; C1-C5alkoxy; halogen, preferably CI; or hydroxy;<br>
R4 and R5 are each independently of the other hydrogen; or C1-C5alkyI;<br>
m    is 1 or 2;<br>
n     is 0 or 1;<br>
if m = 1,<br>
R2   is hydrogen; unsubstituted or phenyl-substituted C1-C12alkyl; or C6-C10aryl;<br>
if m = 2,<br>
R2   is the direct bond; or -(CH2)p-; and<br>
p    is 1 to 3;<br>
for enhancing the photostability of cosmetic or dermatological compositons comprising at<br>
least one further organic UV absorber.<br>
C-1C30alkyl are straight-chain or branched alkyl radicals like methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec.butyl, tert.butyl, amyl, isoamyl ortert.amyl, hexyl, 2-ethylhexyl, heptyl, octyl, isooctyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl. tetradecyl, pentadecyl, hexadecyl, heptadecyl, octadecyl or eicosyl.<br><br>
C5-C7cycloalkyI is for example cyclopentyl, cycoheptyl or preferably cyclohexyl. C1-C5alkoxy is for example methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, butyloxy or pentyloxy. C6-C10aryl is for example naphthyl or preferably phenyl. Preferably benzotrizoles of formula<br><br>
These preferred values for the carbon atom content for R1 determine likewise the preferred and most preferred values for E1 and E2 whose sum in carbon atoms is one less than the total for T2.<br>
The benzotriazoles used in the present invention are normally liquid or non-crystalline mixtures of benzotriazoles.<br><br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, the benzotriazole derivative of formula (1) is present in a cosmetic or dermatological composition which compries at least one further UV absorber in an amount sufficient to photo-stabilize the corresponding UV absorber. "Photo-stabilizing" mrans that the benzotriazole derivative is present in an amount to reduce or eliminate the loss of UV-A absorbency of the cosmetic or dermatological composition which compries at least one further UV absorber following exposure to UV radiation.<br>
In a more preferred embodiment the benzotriazole derivative of formula (1) is present in an amount sufficient to reduce the loss of UV-A absorbency of the composition by about fifty percent following exposure to 33 J/cm2 of full spectrum UV radiation.<br>
In a most preferred embodiment the benzotriazole derivative of formula (1) is present in an amount from about 0.1 % to about 20%, by weight, of the composition.<br>
Preferebly, the method of the present invention relates to cosmetic or dermatiological compositions, which comprise organic UV absorbers, which are selected from cinnamic acid derivatives and dibenzoylmethane derivatives.<br>
Preferably, the cinnamic acid derivatives are selected from isopentyl p-methoxycinnamate, 2-ethylhexyl 4-methoxycinnamate and ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate.<br><br><br>

and (b);<br>
(d)	optionally further UV absorbers; and<br>

The cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations can be prepared by physically mixing the UV absorbers with the adjuvant using customary methods, for example by simply stirring together the individual components, especially by making use of the dissolution properties of the cosmetic UV absorbers.<br>
The total amount of UV absorbers in the cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations is from 0.05-40% by weight, based on the total weight of the composition.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Aromatic substance compounds of the ester type are, for example, benzyl acetate, phenoxyethyl isobutyrate, p-tert-butylcyclohexyl acetate, linalyl acetate, dimethylbenzylcarbinyl acetate, phenylethyl acetate, linalyl benzoate, benzyl formate, ethylmethylphenyl glycinate, allylcyclohexyl propionate, styrallyl propionate and benzyl salicylate. The ethers include, for example, benzyl ethyl ether; the aldehydes include, for example, the linear alkanals having from 8 to 18 hydrocarbon atoms, citral, citronellal, citronellyl oxyacetaldehyde, cyclamen aldehyde, hydroxycitronellal, lilial and bourgeonal; the ketones include, for example, the ionones, isomethylionone and methyl cedryl ketone; the alcohols include, for example, anethol, citronellol, eugenol, isoeugenol, geraniol, linalool, phenyl ethyl alcohol and terpinol; and the hydrocarbons include mainly the terpenes and balsams. It is preferable, however, to use mixtures of various aromatic substances that together produce an attractive scent. Ethereal oils of relatively low volatility, which are chiefly used as aroma components, are also suitable as perfume oils, e.g. sage oil, camomile oil, clove oil, melissa oil, oil of cinnamon leaves, lime blossom oil, juniper berry oil, vetiver oil, olibanum oil, galbanum oil, labolanum oil and lavandin oil. Preference is given to the use of bergamot oil, dihydromyrcenol, lilial, lyral, citronellol, phenyl ethyl alcohol, hexyl cinnamaldehyde, geraniol, benzyl acetone, cyclamen aldehyde, linalool, boisambrene forte, ambroxan, indole, hedione, sandelice, lemon oil, tangerine oil, orange oil, allyl amyl glycolate, cyclovertal, lavandin oil, muscatel sage oil, damascene, bourbon geranium oil, cyclohexyl salicylate, vertofix coeur, iso-E-Super, Fixolide NP, evernyl, iraldein gamma, phenylacetic acid, geranyl acetate, benzyl acetate, rose oxide, romillat, irotyl and floramat alone or in admixture with one another.<br>
Colourants<br>
There may be used as colourants the substances that are suitable and permitted for cosmetic purposes, as compiled, for example, in the publication "Kosmetische Farbemittel" of the Farbstoffkommission der Deutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft, Verlag Chemie, Wein-<br><br>
heim, 1984, pages 81 to 106. The colourants are usually used in concentrations of from 0.001 to 0.1 % by weight, based on the total mixture.<br>
Other adjuvants<br>
It is furthermore possible for the cosmetic preparations to contain, as adjuvants, anti-foams, such as silicones, structurants, such as maleic acid, solubilisers, such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol or diethylene glycol, opacifiers, such as latex, styrene/PVP or sty-rene/acrylamide copolymers, complexing agents, such as EDTA, NTA, alaninediacetic acid or phosphonic acids, propellants, such as propane/butane mixtures, N2O, dimethyl ether, CO2, N2 or air, so-called coupler and developer components as oxidation dye precursors, reducing agents, such as thioglycolic acid and derivatives thereof, thiolactic acid, cysteamine, thiomalic acid or mercaptoethanesulfonic acid, or oxidising agents, such as hydrogen peroxide, potassium bromate or sodium bromate.<br>
Suitable insect repellents are, for example, N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide, 1,2-pentanediol or insect repellent 3535; suitable self-tanning agents are, for example, dihydroxyacetone and/or erythrulose or dihydroxy acetone and/or dihydroxy acetone precursors as described in WO 01/85124 and/or erythrulose.<br>
Polymeric beads or hollow spheres as SPF enhancers<br>
The combination of the UV-absorbers and UV-absorber combinations, listed above, with SPF enhancers, such as non-active ingredients like Styrene/acrylates copolymer, silica beads, spheroidal magnesium silicate, crosslinked Polymethylmethacrylates (PMMA ; Micopearl M305 Seppic), can maximize better the UV protection of the sun products. Holosphere additives (Sunspheres® ISP, Silica Shells Kobo.) deflect radiation and the effective path length of the photon is therefore increased.( EP0893119). Some beads, as mentioned previously, provide a soft feel during spreading. Moreover, the optical activity of such beads, e.g.Micropearl M305, cans modulate skin shine by eliminating reflection phenomena and indirectly may scatter the UV light.<br>
