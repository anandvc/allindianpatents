TECHNICAL FIELD [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for producing a 2-halogenobenzamide compound useful as a starting material or active ingredient for medicines and agrochemicals.<br>
BACKGROUND ART [0002]<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
Problem to be Solved by the Invention [0005]<br>
When the 2-halogenobenzamide compound according to the present invention is produced by a well-known process, regioisomers having *a substituent at an undesirable position are always produced in addition to the desired 2-halogenobenzamide compound.

agent may be used in an amount properly chosen in the range of 2 to 5 equivalents per equivalent of the substituted benzamide derivative of general formula (III).  When the compound as substrate is the sulfoxide compound, the oxidizing agent may be used in an amount properly chosen in the range of 1 to 2 equivalents per equivalent of the substituted benzamide derivative of general formula (III).<br>
[0021]<br>

As to the reaction temperature, the reaction may be carried out in the range of -50°C to the boiling point of the solvent used.  Although the reaction time is varied depending on the scale of reaction, the reaction temperature and the like, it ranges from several minutes to 4 8 hours.  After completion of the reaction, to isolate the compound of general formula (I), i.e., the desired compound, it is sufficient that the compound in the reaction mixture is crystallized,<br><br>
followed by filtration and/or water-washing.  Thus, the compound of general formula (I), the desired compound can be obtained-  Although the compound obtained has a satisfactory quality as it is in some cases, it can, if necessary, be purified by a means such as washing or recrystallization by the use of the above-exemplified solvent for reaction. [0024]<br>
The compound of the above general formula (II) as intermediate can be produced according to a well-known process.

A phthalic anhydride derivative of general formula (IV) is allowed to react with an amine of general formula (V) in the presence or absence of an inert solvent and a base to obtain a compound of general formula (VI-1).

(VII-1) is allowed to react with an amine derivative of general formula (VIII) in the presence of an inert solvent and in the presence or absence of a catalyst after or without isolation of the compound (VII-1), whereby a benzamide compound of general formula (II-l) can be produced.  In the case of a compound (VI-1) in which R6 is a substituent other than a hydrogen atom, this compound (VI-1) is condensed with an amine of general formula (VIII) in the presence of a condensing agent in an inert solvent in the presence or absence of a base after or without isolation of the compound (VI-1), whereby a benzamide compound of general formula<br>
(II-l) can be produced. [0026]<br>
In addition, a phthalic anhydride derivative of general formula (IV) is allowed to react with an amine of general formula (VIII) in the presence or absence of an inert solvent and a base to obtain a compound of general formula (VI-2).

The compound (VII-2) is allowed to react with an amine derivative of general formula (V) in the presence of an inert solvent and in the presence or absence of a catalyst after or without isolation of the compound<br><br>
(VII-2), whereby a benzamide compound of general formula (II-l) can be produced.

[0027]<br>
Furthermore, a compound represented by general formula (II-l') corresponding to general formula (II-l) in which m is defined as 1 can be produced by oxidizing a compound of general formula (II-l) in which m is 0 with an oxidizing agent in an inert solvent in the presence or absence of a catalyst after or without isolation of the compound.
