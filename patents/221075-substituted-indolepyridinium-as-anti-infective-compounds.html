				<td>SUBSTITUTED INDOLEPYRIDIMUM AS ANTI-INFECTIVE COMPOUNDS<br>
The present invention relates to the use of substituted indolepyridinium as anti-infective compounds, and to pharmaceutical compositions and diagnostic kits comprising them. The present invention also concerns combinations of the present substituted indolepyridinium compounds with another anti-retroviral agent. It further relates to their use in assays as reference compounds or as reagents.<br>
The virus causing the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is known by different names, including T-lymphocyte virus in (HTLV-IIT) or lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV) or AIDS-related virus (ARV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HTV). Up until now, two distinct families have been identified, i.e. HIV-1 and HTV-2. Hereinafter, HTV will be used to generically denote these viruses.<br>
AIDS patients are currently treated with HTV protease inhibitors (Pis), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTTs) and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NtRTIs). Those compounds are often administered in drug cocktails comprising two or more compounds of the above classes of drugs. Despite the fact that these antiretrovirals are very useful, they have a common limitation, namely, the targeted enzymes in the HTV virus are able to mutate in such a way that the known drugs become less effective, or even ineffective against these mutant HTV viruses. Or, in other words, the HTV virus creates an ever-increasing resistance against the available drugs.<br>
Resistance of retroviruses, and in particular the HTV virus, against inhibitors is a major cause of therapy failure. For instance, half of the patients receiving anti-HTV combination therapy do not respond fully to the treatment, mainly because of resistance of the virus to one or more drugs used. Moreover, it has been shown that resistant virus is carried over to newly infected individuals, resulting in severely limited therapy options for these drug-naive patients. Therefore, there is a need for new compounds for retrovirus therapy, more particularly for AIDS therapy. This need is particularly acute for compounds that are active not only on wild type HTV virus, but also on the increasingly more common resistant HTV viruses.<br>
Known antiretrovirals, often administered in a combination therapy regimen, will eventually cause resistance as stated above. This often may force the physician to boost the plasma levels of the active drugs in order for said antiretrovirals to regain effectivity against the mutated HIV viruses. The consequence of which is a highly<br>
undesirable increase in pill burden. Boosting plasma levels may also lead to an increased risk of non-compliance with the prescribed therapy.<br>
Currently used commercially available HTV reverse transcriptase inhibitors belong to three different classes, the NRTIs such as zidovudine, didanosine, zalcibatine, stavudine, abacavir and lamivudine, the NtRTIs such as tenofovir, and NNRTIs such as nevirapine, delavirdine and efavirenz. The NRTIs and NtRTIs are base analogs that target the active site of HIV reverse transcriptase (RT). Currently used NNRTI are known for rapid emergence of resistance due to mutations at amino acids that surround the NNRTI binding site (J AIDS 2001, 26, S25-S33).<br>
Thus, there is a high medical need for anti-infective compounds that target HTV reverse transcriptase, in particular anti-retroviral compounds that are able to delay the occurrence of resistance and that combat a broad spectrum of mutants of the HTV virus.<br>

The term "prodrug" as used throughout this text means the pharmacologically acceptable derivatives such as esters, amides and phosphates, such that the resulting in vivo biotransformation product of the derivative is the active drug as defined in the compounds of formula (I). The reference by Goodman and Oilman (The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics,. 8th ed, McGraw-Hill, Int. Ed. 1992, "Biotransformation of Drugs", p 13-15) describing prodrugs generally is hereby incorporated. Prodrugs of a compound of the present invention are prepared by modifying functional groups present in the compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either by routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent compound.<br>
Prodrugs are characterized by excellent aqueous solubility, increased bioavailability and are readily metabolized into the active inhibitors in vivo.<br>
For therapeutic use, the salts of the compounds of formula (T) are those wherein the counterion is pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable. However, salts having a pharmaceutically unacceptable counterion may also find use, for example, in the preparation or purification of a pharmaceutically acceptable compound of formula (I). All salts, whether pharmaceutically acceptable or not are included within the ambit of the present invention.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable or physiologically tolerable addition salt forms which the compounds of the present invention are able to form can conveniently be prepared using the appropriate acids, such as, for example, inorganic acids such as hydrohalic acids, e.g. hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid; sulfuric; hemisulphuric, nitric; phosphoric and the like acids; or organic acids such as, for example, acetic, aspartic, dodecyl-sulphuric, heptanoic, hexanoic, nicotinic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic, lactic, pyruvic, oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, malic, tartaric, citric, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic,/7-toluenesulfonic, cyclamic, salicylic, /?-amino-salicylic, pamoic and the like acids.<br>
Conversely said acid addition salt forms can be converted by treatment with an appropriate base into the free base form.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) containing an acidic proton may also be converted into their non-toxic metal or amine addition salt form by treatment with appropriate organic and inorganic bases. Appropriate base salt forms comprise, for example, the ammonium salts, the alkali and earth alkaline metal salts, e.g. the lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium salts and the like, salts with organic bases, e.g. the benzathine, N-methyl, -D-glucamine, hydrabamine salts, and salts with amino acids such as, for example, arginine, lysine and the like.<br>
Conversely said base addition salt forms can be converted by treatment with an appropriate acid into the free acid form.<br>
The term "salts" also comprises the hydrates and the solvent addition forms that the compounds of the present invention are able to form. Examples of such forms are e.g. hydrates, alcoholates and the like.<br>
The JV-oxide forms of the present compounds are meant to comprise the compounds of formula (I) wherein one or several nitrogen atoms are oxidized to the so-called W-oxide.<br>
The present compounds may also exist in their tautomeric forms. Such forms, although not explicitly indicated in the above formula arc intended to be included within the scope of the present invention. For example, within the definition of Hct, a 5 membered aromatic heterocycle such as for example an 1,2,4-oxadiazole may be substituted with a hydroxy or a thio group in the 5-position, thus being in equilibrium with its respective tautomeric form as depicted below.<br><br>
The term stereochemicaUy isomeric forms of compounds of the present invention, as used hereinbefore, defines all possible compounds made up of the same atoms bonded by the same sequence of bonds but having different three-dimensional structures which are not interchangeable, which the compounds of the present invention may possess.<br>
Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of a compound encompasses the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms which said compound may possess. Said mixture may contain all diastereomers and/or enantio-mers of the basic molecular structure of said compound. All stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of the present invention both in pure form or in admixture with each other are intended to be embraced within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Pure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and intermediates as mentioned herein are defined as isomers substantially free of other enantiomeric or diastereomeric forms of the same basic molecular structure of said compounds or intermediates. In particular, the term 'stereoisomerically pure1 concerns compounds or intermediates having a stereoisomeric excess of at least 80% (i. e. minimum 90% of one isomer and maximum 10% of the other possible isomers) up to a stereoisomeric excess of 100% (i.e. 100% of one isomer and none of the other), more in particular, compounds or intermediates having a stereoisomeric excess of 90% up to 100%, even more in particular having a stereoisomeric excess of 94% up to 100% and most in particular having a stereoisomeric excess of 97% up to 100%. The terms 'enantiomerically pure' and 'diastereoroerically pure' should be understood in a similar way, but then having regard to the enantiomeric excess, respectively the diastereomeric excess of the mixture in question.<br>
Pure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and intermediates of this invention may be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. For instance, enantiomers may be separated from each other by the selective crystallization of their diastereomeric salts with optically active acids or bases. Examples thereof are tartaric acid, dibenzoyl-tartaric acid, ditoluoyltartaric acid and camphosulfonic acid. Alternatively, enantiomers may be separated by chromatographic techniques using chiral stationary phases. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably, if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.<br>
The diastereomeric racemates of formula (I) can be obtained separately by conventional methods. Appropriate physical separation methods that may advantageously be employed are, for example, selective crystallization and chromatography, e.g. column chromatography.<br>
The present invention is also intended to include all isotopes of atoms occurring on the present compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and deuterium. Isotopes of carbon include C-13 and C-14.<br>

The compounds of the present invention inhibit the HIV reverse transcriptase and may also inhibit reverse transcriptases having similarity to HTV reverse transcriptase. Such similarity may be determined using programs known in the art including BLAST. In one embodiment, the similarity at the amino acid level is at least 25%, interestingly at least 50%, more interestingly at least 75%. In another embodiment, the similarity at the amino acid level at the binding pocket, for the compounds of the present invention, is at least 75%, in particular at least 90% as compared to HTV reverse transcriptase. Compounds of the present invention have been tested in other lentivirusses besides HTV-1, such as, for example, SIV and HTV-2.<br>
The compounds of the present invention have a good selectivity as measured by the ratio between ECso and CCso as described and exemplified in the antiviral analysis example. The compounds of the present invention have also a favorable specificity. There exists a high dissociation between the activity on lentiviruses versus other retroviridae, such as MLV, and versus non-viral pathogens. For instance, compound 2 had an ECso value of more than 32 [iM for Mycobacterium b., Plasmodiumf., Trypanosoma b. and Ttypanosoma c. whereas the ECso value for wild-type HTV was well below 100 nM.<br>
The standard of "sensitivity" or alternatively "resistance" of a HTV reverse transcriptase enzyme to a drug is set by the commercially available HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Existing commercial HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors including efavirenz, nevirapine and delavirdine may loose effectivity over time against a population of HTV virus in a patient. The reason being that under pressure of the presence of a particular HTV reverse transcriptase inhibitor, the existing population of HTV virus, usually mainly wild type HTV reverse transcriptase enzyme, mutates into different mutants which are far less sensitive to that same HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor. If this phenomenon occurs, one talks about resistant mutants. If those mutants are not only resistant to that one particular HTV reverse transcriptase inhibitor, but also to multiple other commercially available HTV reverse transcriptase inhibitors, one talks about multi-drug resistant HTV reverse transcriptase. One way of expressing the resistance of a mutant to a particular HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor is making the ratio between the ECso of said HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor against mutant HTV reverse transcriptase over ECso of said HTV reverse transcriptase inhibitor against wild type HTV reverse transcriplase. Said ratio is also called fold change in resistance<br>
(FR). The ECso value represents the amount of the compound required to protect 50% of the cells from the cytopathogenic effect of the virus.<br>
Many of the mutants occurring in the clinic have a fold resistance of 100 or more against the commercially available HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors, like nevirapinc, efavirenz, delavirdine. Clinically relevant mutants of the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme may be characterized by a mutation at codon position 100,103 and 181. As used herein a codon position means a position of an amino acid in a protein sequence. Mutations at positions 100, 103 and 181 relate to non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (D'Aquila et al. Topics in HTV medicine, 2002,10, 11-15). Examples of such clinical relevant mutant HTV reverse transcriptases are listed in Table 1.<br><br>
An interesting group of compounds are those compounds of formula (I) having a fold resistance ranging between 0.01 and 100 against at least one mutant HTV reverse transcriptase, suitably ranging between 0.1 and 100, more suitably ranging between 0.1 and 50, and even more suitably ranging between 0.1 and 30. Of particular interest are the compounds of formula (I) showing a fold resistance against at least one mutant HTV reverse transcriptase ranging between 0.1 and 20, and even more interesting are those compounds of formula (I) showing a fold resistance against at least one mutant HTV reverse transcriptase ranging between 0.1 and 10.<br>
An interesting group of compounds are those compounds of formula (I) having a fold resistance, determined according to the methods herein described, in the range of 0.01 to<br><br>
100 against HTV species having at least one mutation in the amino acid sequence of HIV reverse transcriptase as compared to the wild type sequence (genbank accession e.g. M38432, K03455, gi 327742) at apbsition selected from 100,103 and 181; in particular at least two mutations selected from the positions 100,103 and 181. Even more interesting are those compounds within said interesting group of compounds having a fold resistance in the range of 0.1 to 100, in particular in the range 0.1 to 50, more in particular in the range 0.1 to 30. Most interesting are those compounds within said interesting group of compounds having a fold resistance in the range of 0.1 and 20, especially ranging between 0.1 and 10.<br>
In one embodiment, the compounds of the present invention show a fold resistance in the ranges mentioned just above against at least one clinically relevant mutant HIV reverse transcriptases.<br>
A particular group of compounds are those compounds of formula (I) having an ICso of 1 uM or lower, suitably an ICso of 100 nM or lower vis-a-vis the wild type virus upon in vitro screening according to the methods described herein.<br>
The ability of the present compounds to inhibit HTV-1, HTV-2, SIV and HTV viruses with reverse transcriptase (RT) enzymes having mutated under pressure of the currently known RT inhibitors, together with the absence of cross resistance with currently known RT inhibitors indicate that the present compounds bind differently to the RT enzyme when compared to the known NNRTIs and NRTIs. With respect to the cross resistance, a study with more than 8000 viruses showed that the calculated correlation coefficient between the present compound 2 and known NRTIs, such as for example 3TC, abacavir, AZT, D4T, DDC, DDI, was in all cases lower than 0.28 with an exception of 3TC where the correlation coefficient was about 0.63. The correlation coefficient between the present compound 2 and known NNRTIs such as for example capravirine, delavirdine, nevirapine and efavirenz was in all cases about 0.13 or lower.<br>
The compounds of the present invention show antiretroviral properties, in particular against Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HTV), which is the aetiological agent of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in humans. The HIV virus preferentially infects CD4 receptor containing cells such as human T4 cells and destroys them or changes their normal function, particularly the coordination of the immune system. As a result, an infected patient has an ever-decreasing number of T4 cells, which moreover behave abnormally. Hence, the immunological defence system is unable to combat infections and/or neoplasms and the HTV infected subject usually dies by opportunistic infections such as pneumonia, or by cancers. Other diseases<br>
associated with HIV infection include thrombocytopaenia, Kaposi's sarcoma and infection of the central nervous system characterized by progressive demyelination, resulting in dementia and symptoms such as, progressive dysarthria, ataxia and disorientation. HTV infection further has also been associated with peripheral neuropathy, progressive generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) and AIDS-related complex (ARC). The HTV virus also infects CD8-receptor containing cells. Other target cells for HTV virus include microglia, dendritic cells, B-cells and macrophages.<br>
Due to their favourable pharmacological properties, particularly their activity against HTV reverse transcriptase enzymes, the compounds of the present invention or any subgroup thereof may be used as medicines against above-mentioned diseases or in the prophylaxis thereof. Said use as a medicine or method of treatment comprises the systemic administration to HTV-infected subjects of an amount effective to combat the conditions associated with HTV.<br>

In the preparations described below, the reaction products may be isolated from the medium and, if necessary, iurther purified according to methodologies generally known in the art such as, for example, extraction, crystallization, trituration and chromatography.<br>
Route 1 : Synthesis of present compounds wherein R* is nitro. cvano CRy).<br><br>
The synthesis of compounds (a-6) and (a-7) conveniently starts from l-C].6alkylcarbonyl-3-hydroxyindole (a-1). Condensation of (a-1) with nitroaniline at elevated temperatures and in a suitable solvent such as acetic acid, toluene, benzene, an alcohol and the like, yields 3-((nitrophenyl)amino)indole (a-2). In one embodiment, the nitroaniline is para-nitroaniline. Intermediate (a-2) can then be deacylated with a base, such as for example triethylamine, sodiumhydroxide, sodiumacetate, potassiumacetate or potassiumcarbonate and the like, in a suitable solvent, such as for example methanol or ethanol, and at elevated temperature, yielding intermediate (a-3). Formylation of intermediate (a-3) results in indole aldehyde (a-4) and may be performed by employing for instance a Vilsmeier reaction. Condensation of intermediate (a-4) results in intermediate (a-5). In one embodiment, said condensation may be performed using a base such as for example triethylamine, sodiumacetate, potassiumacetate, piperidine and the like, in a wide variety of solvents, and with a oxycarbonylmethylene reagent of formula CHOR.iP2-C(=O)-OPi, wherein PI represents Ci-salkyl, Cg-naryl orCe-naryl-and ?2 represents a hydrogen, a carboxylic ester, a phosphonium salt or a<br>
phosphonate ester. Suitably, the reagent is of formula CH2Ri-C(=O)-OPi, wherein PI is Ci-salkyl. Subsequent intramolecular cyclisation of intermediate (a-5) at elevated temperature and in a solvent like ethyleneglycol, dioxane, N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, glyme, diglyme and the like, yields compound (a-6) which may be transformed into a compound of formula (a-7) using an N-alkylation reaction with an intermediate of formula R2-X wherein X is a leaving group. Examples of such leaving groups include sulfonates such as tosylate, mesylate; acetates; halogens such bromide, iodide, chloride and fluoride.<br>
Other transformations from the compounds of formula (a-6) and (a-7) may be performed using art-known transformation techniques. For instance, the compounds of formula (a-6) or (a-7) wherein RS is nitro may be reduced to Ra being amino, and may then be further derivatized. Further examples of transformation reactions are given in example schemes A2 through Al5 in the experimental part.<br>
The order of the mentioned steps in said process scheme A may be different. For instance the formylation may be performed prior to deacylation.<br>
Oxycarbonylmethylene reagents of formula CHRiP2-C(=O)-OPi wherein P2 represents a carboxylic ester are for instance dicarboxylic esters of formula PiO-C(=O)-CHP2-C(=O)-OPi. Oxycarbonylmethylene reagents of formula CHRiP2-C(=O)-OPi wherein P2 represents a phosphonium salt may for instance have the formula (Pi)3P=CRj-C(=O)-OPi. Oxycarbonylmethylene reagents of formula CHR]P2-C(=O)-OPi wherein P2 represents (PiO)2P(=O)- may for instance have the formula (PiO)2P(=O)-CHR1-C(=O)-OPi.<br><br>

Elevated temperatures and stirring may enhance the reaction. Said intermediate (b-2) may then be reacted with chloroacetyl chloride or a functional derivative thereof, suitable at elevated temperature, to yield an intermediate of formula (b-3). Said intermediate of formula (b-3) may be deprotected using a suitable base such as trietylamine, sodiumacetate, potassium acetate, sodiumhydroxide, potassiumhydroxide, potassiumcarbonate and the like, in a solvent like methanol or ethanol. Stirring and heating may enhance the reaction. The thus formed intermediate of formula (b-4) may be cyclised by first using potassiumcyanide or tetrabutylammoniumcyanide, and subsequently submitting the intermediate to a Vilsmeier formylation using POCb in N,N-dimethylforrnamide to form compound (b-5) which belongs to the class of compounds of formula (I).<br>
Said compound (b-5) may further be transformed into other compounds of formula (I) using art-known transformation reactions. Of which several are described in the exemplary scheme in the experimental part of the description. For example where Rs is Br, Br may be transformed into a Heterocyclic ring using Heterocyclic borates and palladium.The intermediate (c-1) may be reacted with a reagent of formula (i) in a suitable solvent such as for example toluene, acetic acid, an alcohol and the like, in the presence of a catalyst such as for example p-toluenesulfonic acid to yield an intermediate of formula (c-2). Elevated temperatures and stirring may enhance the reaction. Said intermediate (c-2) may then be reacted with acetic anhydride in the presence of a catalyst such as for example pyridine or dimethylaminopyridine or the b'ke, suitable at elevated temperature, to yield an intermediate of formula (c-3). The thus formed intermediate of formula (c-3) may be reacted using a Vilsmeier reaction with POCb in N,N-dimethylfbrmamide to form intermediate (c-4) which in turn can be further cyclised to compound (c-5) in an aqueous acidic environment.<br>
Said compound (c-5), belonging to the class of compounds of formula (I), may further be transformed into other compounds of formula (1) using art-known transformation reactions.

Stirring may enhance the reaction rate. The thus formed intermediate of formula (d-2) can then be further reacted with hydroxylamine in a solvent like water, ethanol or a mixture thereof and in the presence of a base like sodiumacetate, potassium acetate, potassium carbonate, sodiumacetate and the like, to form an intermediate of formula (d-3). Upon heating and bringing the intermediate of formula (d-3) in an acidic aqueous environment, an intermediate of formula (d-4) is formed. Said intermediate can then be subjected to an intramolecular cyclisation in the presence of POClj in N,N-dimethylformamide. Cooling the reaction mixture may be advantageous. The thus formed intermediate of formula (d-5) can be treated with Zinc in an acidic aqueous environment such as HCI to form an intermediate of formula (d-6). The N-oxide can be prepared using metachloroperbenzoic acid, waterperoxide, tert-butylhydroperoxide and the like, or a functional equivalent thereof in a solvent such as, for example,<br>
dichloromethane, chloroform, an alcohol, toluene or the like, and employing elevated temperatures. Said N-oxide of formula (d-7) can be further reacted, suitably at elevated temperature, with acetic anhydride to form the intermediate of formula (d-8). Finally, a boronic acid of formula (ii) can be used to prepare the compounds of formula (T) equivalent to the formula (d-9). Said reaction step involves the use of copper(H) acetate or an equivalent thereof in a solvent such as for example N,N-dimethyl-formamide, dichloromethane, toluene, an alcohol, chloroform and the like. Suitable a quencher like pyridine may be added to the reaction mixture. Elevating the temperature may enhance the reaction.<br>
Route 5 : synthesis of present compounds with different R2<br>
The compounds of formula (I) wherein R2 is hydrogen can be transformed into compounds of formula (I) wherein R2 is different from hydrogen. For this purpose, reagents like Rj-Cl wherein Cl is a leaving group can be used in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride or potassium carbonate, potassium hydroxide, sodium-hydroxide and the like. Other suitable leaving groups may also be employed such as for example sulfonates such as tosylate, mesylate; acetates; halogens such bromide, iodide, chloride and fluoride.

An interesting way of formulating the present compounds in combination with a cyclodextrin or a derivative thereof has been described in EP-A-721,331. Although the formulations described therein are with antifungal active ingredients, they are equally interesting for formulating the compounds of the present invention. The formulations described therein are particularly suitable for oral administration and comprise an antifungal as active ingredient, a sufficient amount of a cyclodextrin or a derivative thereof as a solubilizer, an aqueous acidic medium as bulk liquid carrier and an alcoholic co-solvent that greatly simplifies the preparation of the composition. Said formulations may also be rendered more palatable by adding pharmaceutically acceptable sweeteners and/or flavours.<br>
Other convenient ways to enhance the solubility of the compounds of the present<br>
invention in pharmaceutical compositions are described in WO 94/05263,<br>
WO 98/42318, EP-A-499,299 and WO 97/44014, all incorporated herein by reference.<br>
More in particular, the present compounds may be formulated in a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of particles consisting of a solid dispersion comprising (a) a compound of formula (I), and (b) one or more pharmaceutically acceptable water-soluble polymers.<br>
The term "a solid dispersion" defines a system in a solid state (as opposed to a liquid or gaseous state) comprising at least two components, wherein one component is dispersed more or less evenly throughout the other component or components. When said dispersion of the components is such that the system is chemically and physically uniform or homogenous throughout or consists of one phase as defined in thermodynamics, such a solid dispersion is referred to as "a solid solution". Solid solutions are preferred physical systems because the components therein are usually readily bioavatlable to the organisms to which they are administered.<br>
The term "a solid dispersion" also comprises dispersions which are less homogenous<br><br>
throughout than solid solutions. Such dispersions are not chemically and physically uniform throughout or comprise more than one phase.<br>
The water-soluble polymer in the particles is conveniently a polymer that has an apparent viscosity of 1 to 100 mPa.s when dissolved in a 2 % aqueous solution at 20°C solution.<br>
Preferred water-soluble polymers are hydroxypropyl mcthylcelluloses or HPMC. HPMC having a methoxy degree of substitution from about 0.8 to about 2.5 and a hydroxypropyl molar substitution from about 0.05 to about 3.0 are generally water soluble. Methoxy degree of substitution refers to the average number of methyl ether groups present per anhydroglucose unit of the cellulose molecule. Hydroxy-propyl molar substitution refers to the average number of moles of propylene oxide which have reacted with each anhydroglucose unit of the cellulose molecule.<br>
The particles as defined hereinabove can be prepared by first preparing a solid dispersion of the components, and then optionally grinding or milling that dispersion. Various techniques exist for preparing solid dispersions including melt-extrusion, spray-drying and solution-evaporation, melt-extrusion being preferred.<br>
It may further be convenient to formulate the present compounds in the form of nanoparticles which have a surface modifier adsorbed on the surface thereof in an amount sufficient to maintain an effective average particle size of less than 1000 nm. Useful surface modifiers are believed to include those that physically adhere to the surface of the antiretroviral agent but do not chemically bond to the antiretroviral agent.<br>
Suitable surface modifiers can preferably be selected from known organic and inorganic pharmaceutical excipicnts. Such excipients include various polymers, low molecular weight oligomers, natural products and surfactants. Preferred surface modifiers include   iluted  c and anionic surfactants.<br>
Yet another interesting way of formulating the present compounds involves a pharmaceutical composition whereby the present compounds are incorporated in hydrophilic polymers and applying this mixture as a coat film over many small beads, thus yielding a composition with good bioavailability which can conveniently be manufactured and which is suitable for preparing pharmaceutical dosage forms for oral administration.<br>
Said beads comprise (a) a central, rounded or spherical core, (b) a coating film of a<br>
hydrophilic polymer and an antiretroviral agent and (c) a seal-coating polymer layer.<br>
Materials suitable for use as cores in the beads are manifold, provided that said materials are pharmaceutically acceptable and have appropriate dimensions and firmness. Examples of such materials are polymers, inorganic substances, organic substances, and saccharides and derivatives thereof.<br>
The route of administration may depend on the condition of the subject, co-medication and the like.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention concerns a kit or container comprising a compound of formula (I) in an amount effective for use as a standard or reagent in a test or assay for determining the ability of a potential pharmaceutical to inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase, HTV growth, or both. This aspect of the invention may find its use in pharmaceutical research programs.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be used in phenotypic resistance monitoring assays, such as known recombinant assays, in the clinical management of resistance developing diseases such as HIV. A particularly useful resistance monitoring system is a recombinant assay known as the Antivirogram®. The Antivirogram® is a highly automated, high throughput, second generation, recombinant assay that can measure susceptibility, especially viral susceptibility, to the compounds of the present invention. (Hertogs K et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 1998; 42(2):269-276, incorporated by reference).<br>
Interestingly, the compounds of the present invention may comprise chemically reactive moieties capable of forming covalent bonds to localized sites such that said compound have increased tissue retention and half-lives. The term "chemically reactive group" as used herein refers to chemical groups capable of forming a covalent bond. Reactive groups will generally be stable in an aqueous environment and will usually be carboxy, phosphoryl, or convenient acyl group, either as an ester or a mixed anhydride, or an imidate, or a maleimidate thereby capable of forming a covalent bond with functionalities such as an amino group, a hydroxy or a thiol at the target site on for example blood components such as albumine. The compounds of the present invention may be linked to maleimide or derivatives thereof to form conjugates.<br>
The dose of the present compounds or of the physiologically tolerable salt(s) thereof to be administered depends on the individual case and, as customary, is to be adapted to the conditions of the individual case for an optimum effect. Thus it depends, of course,<br>
on the frequency of administration and on the potency and duration of action of the compounds employed in each case for therapy or prophylaxis, but also on the nature and severity of the infection and symptoms, and on the sex, age, weight co-medication and individual responsiveness of the human or animal to be treated and on whether the therapy is acute or prophylactic. Customarily, the daily dose of a compound of formula (I) in the case of administration to a patient approximately 75 kg in weight is 1 mg to 3 g, preferably 3 mg to 1 g, more preferably, 5 mg to 0.5 g. The dose can be administered in the form of an individual dose, or divided into several, e.g. two, three, or four, individual doses.<br>

The values correlate directly to the number of living cells remaining in the culture at the completion of the five day incubation. The inhibitory activity of the compound was monitored on the virus-infected cells and was expressed as ECso andECpo- These values represent the amount of the compound required to protect 50% and 90%, respectively, of the cells from the cytopathogenic effect of the virus. The toxicity of the compound was measured on the mock-infected cells and was expressed as CC$o, which represents the concentration of compound required to inhibit the growth of the cells by 50%. The selectivity index (SI) (ratio CQo/ECso) is an<br>
indication of the selectivity of the anti-HTV activity of the inhibitor. Wherever results are reported as e.g. pECso or pCCjo values, the result is expressed as the negative logarithm of the result expressed as ECso or CC$o respectively.<br>
Because of the increasing emergence of drug resistant HTV strains, the present compounds were also tested for their potency against clinically isolated HTV strains harbouring several mutations (Tables 1 and 7). These mutations are associated with resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors and result in viruses that show various degrees of pbenorypic cross-resistance to the currently commercially available drugs such as for instance AZT, didanosine, nevirapine, lamivudine and zalcibatine.<br>
Results;<br>
As a measure of the broad spectrum activity of the present compounds, the ECso was determined. Table 7 shows the results of the antiviral testing of the respective compounds expressed in pECso. The fold resistance rounded to the nearest integer is mentioned between brackets.<br>
As can be seen in this table, the present compounds are effective in inhibiting a broad range of mutant strains: Row A: pECso value towards mutant A, Row B: pECso towards mutant B , Row C: pECso towards mutant C, Row D: pECso towards mutant D, Row E: pECso towards mutant E, Row F: pECso towards mutant F, Row G: pECso towards mutant G, Row H: pECso towards mutant G, Row H: pECso towards mutant H, Row I: pECso towards mutant I, Row J: pECjo towards mutant J, Row K: pECso towards mutant K, Row HIV-2: pECjo towards mutant HTV-2, Row SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus): pECso towards mutant SIV. Row WT: pEC50 against wild type HTV-LAI strain. The toxicity (Tox) is expressed as the pCCso value as determined with mock transfected cells. ND means not determined.<br>
Table 7. Results of the toxicity testing and the resistance testing.<br><br>

Oral availability in the rat and the dog<br>
Compounds of formula (I) were formulated as a 20 mg/ml solution or suspension in DMSO, PEG400 or cyclodextin 40% (CD40%) in water. For most experiments in the rat, three dosing groups were formed: I/ single intraperitoneal dose at 20 mg/kg using the DMSO formulation; 21 single oral dose at 20 mg/kg using the PEG400 formulation and 3/ single oral dose at 20 mg/kg using the cyclodextrin formulation. Blood was sampled at regular time intervals after dosing and drug concentrations in the serum were determined using a LC-MS bioanalytical method.<br>
Formulation<br>
Active ingredient, in casu a compound of formula (I), can be dissolved in organic solvent such as ethanol, methanol or methylene chloride, preferably, a mixture of<br>
ethanol and methylene chloride. Polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone copolymer with vinyl acetate (PVP-VA) or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), typically 5 mPa.s, can be dissolved in organic solvents such as ethanol, methanol methylene chloride. Suitably the polymer can be dissolved in ethanol. The polymer and compound solutions can be mixed and subsequently spray dried. The ratio of compound/polymer can be selected from 1/1 to 1/6. Intermediate ranges can be 1/1.5 and 1/3. A suitable ratio can be 1/6. The spray-dried powder, a solid dispersion, can subsequently be filled in capsules for administration. The drug load in one capsule can range between 50 and 100 mg depending on the capsule size used.<br>
Film-coated Tablets<br>
Preparation of Tablet Core<br>
A mixture of 100 g of active ingredient, in casu a compound of formula (I), 570 g lactose and 200 g starch can be mixed well and thereafter humidified with a solution of 5 g sodium dodecyl sulfate and 10 g polyvinylpyrrolidone in about 200 ml of water. The wet powder mixture can be sieved, dried and sieved again. Then there can be added 100 g microcrystalline cellulose and 15 g hydrogenatcd vegetable oil. The whole can be mixed well and compressed into tablets, giving 10.000 tablets, each comprising 10 mg of the active ingredient. Coating<br>
To a solution of 10 g methylcellulose in 75 ml of denaturated ethanol there can be added a solution of 5 g of ethylcellulose in 150 ml of dichloromethane. Then there can be added 75 ml of dichloromethane and 2.5 ml 1,2,3-propanetriol. 10 g of polyethylene glycol can be molten and dissolved in 75 ml of dichloromethane. The latter solution can be added to the former and then there can be added 2.5 g of magnesium octadecanoate, 5 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone and 30 ml of concentrated color suspension and the whole can be homogenated. The tablet cores can be coated with the thus obtained mixture in a coating apparatus.<br><br>
