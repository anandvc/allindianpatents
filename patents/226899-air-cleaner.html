				<td>Technical field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an air cleaner comprising a fan unit and a filter unit. Prior art<br>
In air cleaners of the type mentioned above the filter unit must be cleaned or exchanged at regular intervals. In connection therewith the filter unit is dismounted from the air cleaner, said filter unit normally being in the shape of a cartridge that either is cleaned or replaced by a new one. The actual dismounting of the filter unit may be difficult and time-consuming, several manipulations may be needed and it is in principle impossible for the operator to avoid to get one's hands dirty when handling the filter unit. A further disadvantage in connection with known air cleaners of the type mentioned above is that in connection to the frame or the like, in which the filter unit is mounted, a certain defilement occurs, said defilement has to be removed, which usually takes place in connection with the cleaning or the exchange of the filter unit. Apart from the fact that the cleaning/the exchange itself of the filter unit is difficult and time-consuming certain associated measures are also necessary.<br>
Objects and features of the invention<br>
A primary object of the present invention is to define an air cleaner of the type mentioned above, where the exchange of filter unit is extremely simple to carry out. A further object of the invention is that the exchange of filter unit may be effected without the operator getting dirty. Still an object of the filter unit according to the present invention is that the exchange of filter unit should not initiate any further associated measures.<br>
Brief description of the accompanying drawings<br>
Below a number of embodiments of the invention will be described, reference being made to the accompanying drawings, where:<br>
FIG. 1 shows a section through a first embodiment of a schematically disclosed air cleaner according to the present invention;<br>
FIG. 2 shows a section through an alternative embodiment of a schematically disclosed air cleaner according to the present invention; and<br>
FIG. 3 shows in perspective an exploded view of a quick coupling for mutual connection of the fan unit and the filter unit.<br><br>
Detailed description of preferred embodiments<br>
The air cleaner according to FIG. 1 includes a fan unit 1 and a filter unit 3. In the disclosed embodiment the air cleaner has the fan unit 1 oriented in such a way that its suction side is faces the interior of the filter unit 3, i.e. air is sucked in through the filter unit 3 and passes then through the fan unit 1, whose pressure side faces the air that surrounds the air cleaner. That is, cleaned air is forced by the fan unit outside the air cleaner. The fan unit 1 may have different shapes. Preferably, the fan unit constitutes a so-called electronic fan. Such fans are often of axial type and have a relatively small static pressure. This type of fan is normally used to cool electronics, e.g. computers, and not in applications that require a higher static pressure, e.g. air cleaners. However, if the filter medium area in an air cleaner is made sufficiently large, so-called electronic fans may be used also in air cleaners, e.g. of the type that the present invention represents.<br>
In exemplifying and non-restricting purpose it is stated that Papst 4412 FGL has turned out to be a suitable fan unit, said fan normally being used for cooling electronics. This fan is of axial type and is fed by direct current having a voltage of 12V. The current intensity is 105 mA at a voltage of 12V, i.e. the effect fed to the fan is very low, more precisely 1,25 W. The fan is capable of handling only a very moderate static pressure, for a static counter pressure of 8 Pa the fan generates an air How of 50 m3/h. In a free blowing state the fan generates about 90 m3 /h.<br>
As indicated in FIG. 1 an ionization device 5 may e.g. be provided on the fan unit 1, said ionization device 5 being in the shape of a graphite yarn brush. Thereby, so-called external ionization of the air that surrounds the air cleaner takes place, whereby an increased degree of separation may be achieved. In this connection it should be pointed out that the air cleaner according to the present invention does not need to have an ionization device.<br>
The filter unit 3 according to the present invention is of so-called disposable type, i.e. it is not cleaned but replaced by a new filter unit while the dirty filter unit preferably is burned. Since the whole filter unit 3 is of disposable type, said filter unit 3 may without any inconvenience -be provided with a large filter medium area in comparison to the volume of the filter unit 3.<br>
The filter unit 3, schematically shown in FIG. 1, comprises a box shaped casing 7 that is<br><br>
provided with a number of inlet openings 9 and an outlet opening 10. the fan unit 1 K mounted in said outlet opening 10. In the disclosed embodiment the actual filter mediu, is mounted a certain distance inside of the surfaces defining the casing 7. By this arrange a slot 12 is pros ided between the casing 7 and the filter medium 11. said slot 12 distrik the inlet air substantially uniform over the entire filter medium area.<br>
The arrows 15 symbolise the air entering the filler unit 3, the ;.rrows II ssmbolise how entering air is spread in the slot 12. the arrows 15 symbolise the cleaned air that passes through the filter medium 11 while the arrows 16 ssmbolise the air that exits the air cle.<br>
In connection with replacement of a filter unit 3 in an air cleaner according to the present invention onls the fan unit I is dismounted from the opening 10 in the filter unit 3. the the fan unit 1 is mounted in a new filter unit 3 while the dirts filler unit a preferabls is awas to be burned. Dismounting mounting of the fan unit 1 will be described more in detail below in connection with reference to FIG. 3.<br>
I he casing 7 is preferably manufactured in an environment friend Is and combustible material, e.g. corrugated fibreboard. Another feasible material is "polyprops lenwell, a corrugated librchoard type material of polypropylene. Also the filter medium should be clisens as environment friendly as possible.<br>
In order to achiesc a sufficient air flow for air cleaning ssith the fan described above the !.' medium incorporated in the filter unit must base a vers low pressure drop, and in comic, with the tan in question said pressure drop should not exceed 4 Pa. which results in and about SO m' h using the tan in question.<br>
In exemplifying and non-restricting purpose it is stated that a suitable filter medium has turned out to be B1 120 P 001, which is available from Camfill AB among others. Ace to the specifications this filter medium has a pressure drop of 30 pa at a face selocils of cm s through the filter medium. If a filler medium area of 3 m' is used a pressure drop 5ps is achiesed at an air flow of 100 mh.<br>
Generalls. the degree of separation of a filter medium increases when the art selocils dy the filler medium decreases. According to the specifications for the filter medium mera<br><br>
above. said filter medium has a degree of separation for particles m of about 25% at face sclocits of ahout 15 cm s. At an air flow of 100 m/h and a filter medium area of 3 i.e. a face sclocits of ahout I cm s. a degree of separation of ahout 85" has heen registered tor particles 0.3 m. this being a significant increase. Apart from the tact that a louer pressure drop is achieved o\er the filter medium when the filler medium area is increased aKo an increased degree of separation is achieved.<br>
In the embodiment disclosed in I Ki. 2 the air flow has reversed direction through the air cleaner compared to the embodiment according to H(i. I. Otherwise the air cleaner according to I Ki. 2 is structurally designed in a corresponding ssas as the an cleaner according to I K i. 1. Therefore, the structural design of the air cleaner disclosed in FIG 2 is not dcscribri in detail, but reference is made to the description relating to FIG. I. In IK I 2 the corresponding reference numerals as in Fig. 1 have been used lor identical details<br>
The fan unit in 1 fig 2 has been given the reference numeral I" since this fan unit I' has been oriented with its suction side facing outwards tow arils the air that surrounds the air cleanel. while the pressure side of the fan unit 1' is lacing towards the interior oi the tiller unit difference in orientation of the fan unit 1 'does not imipls ans deterioration ol'the technical performance of the air cleaner compared to the embodiment according to Fig 1 forever the fan until becomes dirts after a certain time of use since it contmuosasls handles unfiltered air in contrast to the fan unit 1 of the embodiment according to fig 1. which handles filtered air<br>
Due to the direction of the air floss in the embodiment according to fig. 2 the ionzation device 5' is located inside the casing 7 at the pressure side ol the fan unit 1'. said ionization des ice 5' being in the shape of a graphite sarn brush. therebs. so-called internal ionization : achieved. I he air cleaner according to fig. 2 does not need to base an ionization des ice s In 1 Id. 2 the arrows 13 symbolise the air entering the filter unit 2v the arrows 11' ssmbolise-how the entering air is spread before it passes through the filter medium I I. the across s I 5' symbolise the cleaned air that has passed through the filter medium I I sshile the arrows l<y snibolise the air that exits from cleaner></y>
In fig - is schematically illustrated a feasible quick coupling according the present insention. said quick coupling being located between the Ian unit I and the titer unit 3<br><br>
precisely said quick- coupling constitutes a socalled bayonet coupling between the fan unit I and the filter unit 3. A number of tongues 17 are provided on the fan unit 1 while a number of recesses 18 are provided in the opening 10 of the filter unit 3. said recesses 18 corresponding to the tongues 17. The bayonct coupling functions in a conventional way. i.e. when the fan unit 1 is mounted in the opening 10 of the tiller unit 3 the tongues 17 are fitted in the recesses 18. the Ian unit 18 then rotated a certain angle and the fan unit I is connected to the filter unit 3 in proper way. Dismounting is carried out in the reversed wav. i.e. rotation of the fan unit I until the tongues 17 are facing the recesses 18 and then the fan unit I can be removed from the filler unit 3.<br>
the principle of the present invention is based upon the fact the it the filter unit 3 constitutes substantially the entire visual part of the air cleaner. The opening 10. which is adapted to receiye the fan unit 1. constitutes only a minor part of the total external surface trial defines the filter unit 3 According to the invention the area of the opening 10 constitutes less than 500C of The total external surface that delines the filter unit 3 and preferably the area of the opening 10 constitutes less than 25oc of the total external surface that defines the filter unit the corresponding reasoning is in principle also valid for the area of the fan unit 1 ie it should also constitutes onlv a minor part of the total external surface that defines the fillet unit tus. the fan unit I has normally) wo extension worth mentioned outside the opening. 10. in which the fan unit 1 is mounted In this connection, the total external surface that defines the filler unit includes also the area that represents the openings of the filter unit, e g the mounting opening 10 of the tan unit 1 and the inlet openings 9.<br>
Below, a number of examples will be given where a number of parameters have been allotted<br>
different values, which results in a certain degree of separation. Said examples are based on<br>
practical tests that have been carried out with a fan and a filler medium as specified above.<br>
example 1<br>
filter medium area: 2.6 in'<br>
Air flow through the filler medium: about SO m'/h<br>
Pressure drop over the filter medium about -4 Pa<br>
Degrec of'separation for the particles -0.5 mum: about 85°o<br>
Example 2<br>
filler medium area: 1 3 m2<br>
Air flow through the tiller medium: about .30 m3 /h<br><br>
Pressure drop over the filter medium: about 10 Pa Degree ol separation tor the particles -0,3 m: about 70%<br>
the examples show the importance of a large fliter medium area, the fan used ii.<br>
examples do not manage the higher pressure drop that is a consequence of a smai.....1<br>
area.<br>

the quick coupling disclosed in I I(i. i is of course only an example of a number feasible quick couplings. In exemplifying and non-restricting purpose alternative couplings in the shape ol double sided adhesive tape. Velcro' tape and barbed spike-mentioned. In the pending patent application. b\ quick coupling should be under coupling that allows mutual connection of the fan unit and the tiller unit by only manipulations.<br>
the loeation of the fan unit I on a planar side of the filter unit i is onlv ofleasiblc Within the scope of the invention it is for instance feasible to locate the fan unit on a truncated corner ot the filter unit<br>
from fig 3 it is learnt that the casing. 7 is in the shape of a parallelepiped. 1 lover the scope of the invention the shape of the casing may be varied in principle tree the functionol the air cleaner is not of risk.<br>
flow the filter medium is designed and located inside the casing mav also he a part<br>
ways also in this case the function of the air cleaner must be considered.<br>
Within the scope of the invention it is also feasible that the filter medium, apart fr-<br>
