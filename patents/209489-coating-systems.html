COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"A COATING SYSTEM"     <br>
BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a German company, of D-51368, Leverkusan, Germany and TECHNOGEL GMBH 85 CO. KG., of Max-Nader-Str. 15, 37115 Duderstadt, Germany,<br>
The   following  specification  particularly  describes   the   nature   of the<br>
invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-                          GRANTED<br><br><br><br>
10-3-2006<br><br>
1<br><br>
The present invention relates to a multilayer coating system comprising a thick, gel¬like base layer and a top layer of polvurethane lacquer,and their production and use (application).<br>
In the automobile industry it is nowadays standard practice for e.g. the instrument panel<br>
to use an uncoated plastics material (cheap solution with poor optical and<br>
i haptic properties and poor resistance to environmental influences),<br>
to apply a composite structure consisting of polyurethane foam and film, textile material or leather as decorative layer by means of adhesive bonding (good haptic properties, but high costs due to complicated production),<br>
subsequently to lacquer the employed plastics materials, e.g. using' a two-component polyurethane-based 50 pm thin soft-feel lacquer (average haptic    properties, good resistance properties, average price).<br>
This also applies as appropriate to the other areas of use of plastics materials that come into direct contact with human skin. The soft effect of the thin soft-feel lacquer layers can be enhanced only within certain limits (e.g. by increasing the layer thickness to 100 urn), and moreover the resistance properties and optical properties of the lacquer film are generally impaired.<br>
The composite structure consisting of carrier/foam/film also has a number of disadvantages:<br>
The production costs are high and accordingly such systems are expensive.<br>
2<br><br>
The light-fastness is often not adequate.<br>
The use of plasticisers in the films contributes significantly to fogging.<br>
Anhydrous gel compositions such as are described for example in EP-AO 057 838 and EP-A 0 057 839 have in the meantime become widely available on the market and are manufactured and used according to the processes described in these publications.     These  applications  relate  to   anhydrous   gel   compositions,   gel<br>
 	compositions with a depot effect optionally containing active substances, consisting<br>
of a polyurethane matrix and high molecular weight polyols as dispersing agents and optionally active substances, as well as to a process for the production of the gel compositions, optionally in the presence of the active substances. Biocides, pharmaceuticals, ethereal oils, fragrances, colouring agents, cleaning agents, anti-<br>
 	ageing agents, lubricants and antistatics, and other materials may be used as active<br>
substances. The gel compositions may be employed as casting or pouring compositions or as mouldings containing active substances having a depdt effect of the said active substances. These gels are of course used as such and are covered with for example films or textile materials in order to permit use as a block gel.<br>
Water-based gels have been used for some years in many technical sectors (see for<br>
example R.L. Whistler, Industrial Gums, Academic Press, InC, New York, 1973 and<br>
DE-A 2 347 299). A particularly interesting property of the gels is that they possess<br>
a high casting accuracy. This is utilised in order to duplicate mouldings. In this case<br>
 	the body to be cast is recast with the gel-forming composition.   The moulding is<br>
removed after the gel formation. A gel mould is obtained whose cavity corresponds to the volume of the moulding. An agar-gel is used as duplicating composition, for example in the dental sector. Such compositions have a number of disadvantages however:<br>
3<br><br>
a)	the gelling takes a long time and has to be carried out under specific process conditions,<br>
b)	the elasticity of the gel is not sufficiently high for the demoulding of thin crosspieces and undercuts,<br>
c)	the dimensional stability is unsatisfactory, and<br>
d)	if the gel mould is kept in the open air the dimensions change even after a<br>
                     very short time as a result of evaporation of water.<br>
Anhydrous casting compositions are also known, for example based on silicone. These are produced by mixing a prepolymer with a small amount of crosslinking agent. The model to be cast is poured together with this reaction mixture and removed after the mixture has hardened. A mould is obtained having a cavity in which castings of the model can then be produced. Anhydrous casting compositions have the following disadvantages however:<br>
a)	too high a viscosity for the casting of very fine depressions and undercuts in<br>
                    the surface of the model, and<br>
b)	too long reaction times: with the reduction of the reaction time by increasing<br>
the proportion of the crosslinking agent the result is an excessive shrinkage of<br>
the mould.<br>
Gel compositions containing active substances with a depot effect, in which the active substances are released to the surrounding medium over a period of weeks to months, are known for example from US-A 3 822 238 and 3 975 350. Furthermore, it is known from DE-A 25 21 265 that water-containing and/or alcohol-containing polyurethane-polyurea gels can be produced in the presence of fragrances. Carrier materials based on water-containing gels are described, which may contain a very<br><br>
4<br><br>
wide variety of agents, e.g. pharmaceuticals, biocides or fragrances. Such water-based gels have the disadvantage however that many agents, for example biocides, may be relatively rapidly decomposed due to the presence of the water and thus the time of effectiveness of these gels, i.e. the depot effect, is greatly reduced. It is also known to incorporate solid and/or foamed high molecular weight polyurethanes as active substances (CH-A 289 915).<br>
Such high molecular weight polyurethanes have the disadvantage however that a large proportion of the incorporated liquid agents remains in the polyurethane as a result of the universally high molecular weight structure and/or too high a proportion of rigid material, and are thus lost for the depot effect. Solid active agents can be used only to a very limited extent; non-volatile solid substances do not migrate out and highly volatile solid substances can diffuse out only for a very short time and in very small amounts.<br>
EP-A 0 057 838 and EP-A 57 839 describe gels based on polyols that have a high casting accuracy without suffering from the aforementioned disadvantages. These gels are obtained by reacting one or more higher functional, high molecular weight polyols in the presence of catalysts and optionally fillers and additives with such an amount of organic diisocyanates and/or polyisocyanates that an isocyanate index of about 15 - 60 is obtained. The term "isocyanate index" denotes the equivalence ratio (NCO/OH) x 100. As has been found, elastic gels according to the invention that are synthesised from a covalently crosslinked polyurethane matrix and one or more polyols rigidly bound therein (i.e. without the danger of an interfering exudation) are obtained only if the isocyanate and polyol components reacting with one another have a certain minimum functionality and if the polyol or polyols are substantially free from fractions with an OH number of more than 112 or have a molecular weight below 800, preferably below 1000.<br>
It was then also found that gel compositions with improved depot effect, uniform release of active substances, high active substance concentrations, good stability of<br><br><br>
5<br><br>
the active substance additives and good migration ability of the active substances are obtained if active substances are dissolved or dispersed, as additives, in high molecular weight polyols in the polyurethane-forming reaction, and diisocyanates and/or polyisocyanates as well as catalysts and optionally conventional additives are mixed in.<br>
The advantages of these gel compositions is that a high proportion of high molecular weight polyols is present in the only partially crosslinked polyurethane matrix, which permits and regulates the migration and release of the active substances to the outside.<br>
The disadvantage however is the surface of these gels, which is too rubbery and therefore sensitive to dirt, and does not have a good feel (is too tacky) and accordingly has unsatisfactory haptic properties. Either a film or textile material is therefore applied as protective layer. The films are for example also necessary in order to be able to handle the gel at all This is firstly expensive and furthermore permits only a restricted use, or even no use at all of the gel in various applications where this film interferes (for example the central console in automobile interiors).<br>
 A lacquering with an elastic network would be an alternative in this case. It is known to coat for example plastics substrates produced by injection moulding with two-component, conventional (solvent-containing or aqueous) clear lacquers or topcoat lacquers in a spray process. In this way a surface protection can already be achieved with a 10-100 um thin coating. The elasticity of the coating is matched to that of the substrate and is generally in the range 
exhibit this behaviour.<br>
6<br><br>
In contrast to the lacquering of metal parts, for coating plastics substrates flexible<br>
lacquers are used since for example hard lacquers would lead to an embrittlement of<br>
the overall structure (plastics material + lacquer). This could result, for example at<br>
low temperatures, in a shattering of the structural part due to crack propagation in the<br>
event of a mechanical contact. Elastic plastics lacquers thus generally have<br>
elongations at break of ca. 5-100% and may be loaded in the bending test (bending of<br>
a lacquered Bayflex substrate) down to -20°C without undergoing crack formation.<br>
The rebound behaviour is however in most cases only moderate, since the lacquer has<br>
 	formed a solid polymer network.    Also, thermoplastics materials for example<br>
generally have a 1000%).<br>
 	In order to protect the surface of gels as indicated above, for example against dirt,<br>
scratching, light influences and weathering, as well as against solvents, a lacquering would be appropriate. However, the typical elastic plastics lacquers are inadequate, especially as regards two aspects:<br>
 	-	the adhesion to such elastic substrates capable of recovery (even after<br>
weathering) is unsatisfactory;<br>
the elongation at break and rebound behaviour of elastic substrates is adversely affected by an insufficiently elastic lacquer layer (for example the whole gel can crack or the lacquer can flake off).<br>
With gels there is also the additional requirement that in many applications the<br>
surface should have haptic properties (bicycle saddles, seat cushions, etc.), and at the<br>
same time must also be resistant to solvents, chemicals (acids, alkalis, detergents)<br>
	and to weathering. This requirement cannot be met with conventional coatings. For<br><br>
7<br><br><br>
example, the Impranil® C solution described in EP-A 057 839 is unsatisfactory as a coating since it does not have adequate resistance to solvents.<br>
The object of the invention was accordingly to provide coating systems that do not exhibit the aforementioned disadvantages and which moreover offer advantages as regards handling and haptic properties (gripping behaviour on the surface).<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that in a combination structure consisting of a base layer formed from a high molecular weight, gel-like polyurethane and a top layer of polyurethane lacquer, an overall coating can be obtained that has the desired properties:<br>
high horizontal haptic properties due to the gel-like base layer,<br>
high vertical haptic properties due to the top layer of polyurethane lacquer,<br>
good resistance to environmental influences imparted by the top layer,<br>
high expansibility and at the same time high rebound behaviour after both layers have been subjected to pressure and/or tensile stresses.<br>
The present invention relates to a multilayer coating comprising<br>
a)	a base layer of high molecular weight, gel-like polyurethanes,<br>
b)	a top layer consisting of polyurethane lacquer<br>
which can be applied to any suitable substrates and can be used in all areas of industrial application where a surface is to be produced that is characterised by<br>
outstanding soft effect<br><br><br>
                                                            8<br><br>
_Le A 34 385-Foreign Countries<br>
and good resistance to environmental influences<br>
and/or simple production and processing<br>
and high expansibility and rebound capacity (in order to be able to adapt the mechanical properties ideally to all substrates)<br>
and that does not have the aforementioned disadvantages, as well as its production and use.<br>
It has furthermore surprisingly been found that the advantages of the gels described in EP-A 0 057 838 and 0 057 839 are not affected by this composite structure but are even improved. The composite structure consisting of gel-like polyurethane + top layer thus also exhibits all the advantages of the known gels (EP-A 005 739 and EP-A 005 738).<br>
Besides this, there are however a whole number of further advantages:<br>
The gel no longer has to be coated with a film or with a textile material, but is lacquered subsequently or preferably directly in the mould and can then be applied jointly with the thick-layer gel composition to other substrates.<br>
This permits the production of structural parts in one workstage.<br>
The surface properties are significantly improved (haptic properties, resistances, freedom from dust). The handling is thereby also significantly improved.<br>
Optical effects (specific single shades, metallic colours or high gloss) can be achieved. This was not possible with the previous combination.<br><br>
9<br><br>
Also a completely new use is possible, namely the application of the gel-like<br>
polyurethane primer to any suitable substrates by knife coating, spraying,<br>
	pouring, followed by sealing of the surface by the polyurethane lacquering.<br><br>
Similarly novel is then also a sandwich combination consisting of poly¬<br>
urethane lacquer/gel-like primer/polyurethane lacquer. This enables for<br>
example films to be produced that are provided on both sides with a surface<br>
coating. Further composite structures are also possible (for example<br>
10	polyurethane   top   layer/polyurethane   primer/carrier   material/polyurethane<br>
primer/polyurethane top layer).<br>
The present invention accordingly relates to<br>
 	a)        the production and formation of gel-like base layers comparable to EP-A<br>
0 057 838 in a layer thickness of 0.01-100 mm in combination with<br>
b)        a polyurethane protective layer in a layer thickness of 0.005-2 mm of solvent-<br>
free, solvent-containing or aqueous, highly elastic polyurethane coatings. The<br>
10	coatings according to the invention exhibit good elongation and rebound<br>
behaviour.<br>
The present invention accordingly provides coating systems of<br>

d)	further fillers and auxiliary substances.<br><br>
Preferred are gels containing 20 to 57 wt.% of the high molecular weight matrix (1) and 80 to 43 wt.% of the liquid dispersing agent (2).   The high molecular weight<br>
 	matrix is according to the invention a reaction product of one or more poly-<br>

The coating systems according to the invention preferably comprise 20 to 57 wt.% of<br>
the high molecular weight matrix and 80 to 43 wt.% of the liquid dispersing agent,<br>
the high molecular weight matrix being a reaction product of one or more<br>

In order to improve the resistance to chemicals, polyisocyanates with an NCO content of 4-50 wt.% may optionally be added in amounts of up to 40% of the total formulation, to the coating systems according to the invention.<br>
Mixing the polyhydroxyl compounds with for example polyacrylates in order to improve the resistance to chemicals is also possible according to the invention.<br>
The top lacquers of the coating system according to the invention are for example formulations of polyurethane top lacquers with<br>
up to 150% of fillers (e.g. titanium dioxide)<br>

up to 5% of light stabilisers (such as Tinuvin® 1130), as well as<br>
optionally dyes, pigments, metal glitter etc.<br>
13<br><br>
The coating systems according to the invention are suitable for example for producing a multilayer coating comprising<br>
a gel-like primer with a layer thickness of 30 um-10 mm,<br>
a top layer of for example polyurethane lacquer with a layer thickness of 5 um-2 mm.<br>
The production of a multilayer coating is carried out according to the invention by<br>
a)	introducing the gel-like primer into a mould by knife application, pouring, spraying, injecting;<br>
b)	applying the top layer by means of knife coating, pouring, spraying, injecting;<br>
c)	arbitrary variation of a) and b) as regards order, e.g.<br>
first applying the top layer to the mould wall and then applying the primer;<br>
first applying the primer and then applying the top layer to the primer, followed by reaction in a closed or open mould;<br>
first applying the primer and then applying the top lacquer to the mould wall, followed by reaction in a closed mould;<br>
d)	introduction of the carrier material to be coated into the mould by<br>
e)	injection (e.g. plastics materials, thermosetting materials, etc.),<br>
f)	insertion (e.g. metal, textile material, wood, finished structural parts),<br><br>
14<br><br>
g) knife application, pouring, spraying (e.g. films, polyurethane lacquer, sprayed skins),<br>
h) application of the primer and of the top lacquer with the variations described in a) and b), to the carrier material to be coated, hardening of the coating, and removal of the finished coated structural part from the mould,<br>
i) production of the primer and of the top lacquer in the mould followed by introduction of the carrier material to be coated into the mould, reaction, and removal of the finished coated structural part.<br>
Different multilayer structures are possible according to the invention, having for example the following construction:<br>
a)	top lacquer/primer/top lacquer;<br>
b)	top lacquer/primer/top lacquer/carrier (preparation according to a) followed by application to any suitable carrier by the known bonding techniques with for example 1-component or 2-component polyurethane adhesives);<br>
c)	top lacquer/primer/carrier/primer/top lacquer;<br>
d)	carrier 1 /primer/top lacquer/carrier 2 with carrier 1, for example films, textile material and carrier 2 as arbitrary materials described in 10.<br>
The invention also provides for the use of the polyurethane systems according to the invention for coatings that require a special handling behaviour (haptic properties), for example that should exhibit a soft handling behaviour (soft-feel haptic property).<br>
15<br><br>
The desired haptic properties are obtained on the one hand through the content of flexible polyols based on polyester, polyester/polyacrylate or polyacrylate (optionally a mixture of OH-functional and non-functional polyols). The conventional fillers and additives that are used may also influence the haptic properties.<br>
All lacquer systems according to the invention can be processed by conventional procedures. In particular the application in the IMC (in-mould coating) process is covered by the invention. This process involves the application of the lacquers in one or both halves of the mould, the gel-like primer is produced between the mould halves as described in EP-A 005 783, and the complete coating can be removed from the mould and then applied to any suitable carrier (metal, wood, plastics, ceramics, stone, concrete, glass, mineral substrates, etc.).<br>

50,   the   mathematical   product   of   the   functionalities   of   the<br>
polyurethane-forming components is at least 5.2 and the polyhydroxyl<br>
5	compounds are substantially free of hydroxyl compounds with a<br>
molecular weight below 800, and<br>
II)       in addition a polyurethane coating<br>
 	is applied to this gel (I) by spraying, knife coating or other application techniques.<br>
 	In accordance with the invention the top lacquer of the component II) may be applied<br>
later, or preferably by application to the wall or walls of the mould in which the gel is produced, followed by gel formation in this mould.<br><br>
The polyols to be used according to the invention for the gel-like primer are preferably the polyhydroxypolyesters, polyhydroxypolyethers, polyhydroxypolythioethers, polyhydroxypolyacetales, polyhydroxypolycarbonates or polyhydroxypolyester amides in the molecular weight range, OH number range and<br>

and liquid at room temperature or slightly above room temperature.<br>
The hydroxyl group-containing polyesters that may be used are for example reaction products of polyhydric, preferably dihydric and optionally in addition trihydric and<br>
 	tetrahydric alcohols with polybasic, preferably dibasic carboxylic acids.   Instead of<br>
the free polycarboxylic acids, the corresponding polycarboxylic acid anhydrides or corresponding polycarboxylic acid esters of lower alcohols or their mixtures may also be used to produce the polyesters. The polycarboxylic acids may be aliphatic, cycloaliphatic,  aromatic  and/or heterocyclic in nature  and  may optionally be<br>
 	substituted, for example by halogen atoms, and/or unsaturated.<br><br><br>
18<br><br>
Examples of such polycarboxylic acids and their derivatives that may be mentioned<br>
 	include adipic acid, sebacic acid, phthalic acid, phthalic anhydride, tetrahydrophthalic<br>
anhydride or hexahydrophthalic anhydride, isophthalic acid, trimellitic acid, maleic<br>
anhydride, dimerised and trimerised unsaturated fatty acids, dimethyl terephthalate<br>
 	and terephthalic acid bis-glycol ester.<br>
Suitable polyhydric alcohols are for example ethylene glycol, propylene glycol,<br>

The polyesters may contain a proportion of terminal carboxyl groups.  Polyesters of<br>
 	lactones, e.g. e-caprolactone or hydroxycarboxylic acids, for example 8-hydroxy-<br>
carboxylic acids, for example hydroxycaproic acid, may also be used.<br><br><br>
The polyols containing at least 2, as a rule 2 to 8 and preferably 2 to 3 hydroxyl groups that may also be used according to the invention are those of the type known per se and are produced for example by homopolymerisation of epoxides such as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide, tetrahydrofuran, styrene oxide or epichlorohydrin, for example in the presence of Lewis catalysts, or by addition of these epoxides, preferably ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, optionally as a mixture or in succession, to starting components having reactive hydrogen atoms such as water, alcohols, ammonia or amines, e.g. ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, diethylolpropane, glycerol, sorbitol, sucrose, formitol or formose, as well as l-(4,4'-dihydroxydiphenyl)propane, aniline, ethylenediamine or ethanol-amine.<br>
	Polythioethers, polybutadienes, polyacetals,  polycarbonates  or polyester amides<br>
containing OH groups may also be used as starting products.   Also suitable are<br><br>
19 <br>
polyhydroxyl compounds already containing urethane and/or urea groups, as well as optionally modified natural polyols such as castor oil.<br>
Polyhydroxyl compounds that contain high molecular weight polyadducts and/or<br>
polycondensates or polymers in finely dispersed or dissolved form may optionally<br>
also be used according to the invention. Such polyhydroxyl compounds are obtained<br>
for example by carrying out polyaddition reactions (e.g. reactions between<br>
polyisocyanates and aminofunctional compounds) or polycondensation reactions (e.g.<br>
between formaldehyde and phenols and/or amines) in situ in the hydroxyl group-<br>
 	containing compounds mentioned above.<br>
The polyhydroxyl compounds modified by vinyl polymers, such as are obtained for<br>
example by the polymerisation of styrene and/or acrylonitrile in the presence of<br>
polyethers or polycarbonate polyols, are also suitable for the process according to the<br>
 	invention.<br>
Examples of the aforementioned high molecular weight polyhydroxyl compounds to be used according to the invention are listed for example in High Polymers, Vol. XVI, "Polyurethanes, Chemistry and Technology", edited by Saunders - Frisch,<br>
 	Interscience Publishers, New York, London, Vol. I, 1962, pp. 32-42 and pp. 44-54<br>
and Vol. II, 1964, pp. 5-6 and 198-199, and also in Kunststoff-Handbuch, Vol. VII, Vieweg-Hochtlen, Carl-Hanser-Verlag, Munich, 1966, for example on pages 45 to 71, as well as in DE-A 29 20 501, pp. 17 to 24. Obviously mixtures of the afore¬mentioned compounds, for example mixtures of polyethers and polyesters, may be<br>
 	used.<br>
The polyhydroxyl polyethers of the aforementioned type known per se in poly-<br>
urethane chemistry and containing 2 to 6, particularly preferably 2 to 3 hydroxyl<br>
groups in the molecule and with a statistically or segmentally incorporated ethylene<br>
 	oxide content of at least 10 wt.%, preferably more than 15 wt.% and particularly<br>
preferably of at least 20 wt.%, are preferably used as high molecular weight polyols<br><br>
20<br><br><br><br><br>
according to the invention. Most particularly preferred are polypropylene ether polyols with at least 20 wt.% of ethylene oxide, in which at least 15 wt.% of the OH terminal groups are primary hydroxyl groups.<br>
	The content of polyols in the gel-forming mixture to be used according to the<br>
invention is about 80 - 99 wt.%, preferably about 85 to 98 wt.%, referred to the total weight of the gel-forming mixture of polyurethane starting components.<br>
The following compounds may be mentioned as examples of flexible, solvent-<br>
	containing, solvent-free or aqueous polyols for the polyurethane top layer that are<br>
suitable according to the invention:<br>

	In principle all elastic polyols having a suitable elongation and rebound behaviour are<br>
suitable.	<br><br>
21<br><br>
It has been found by experience that flexible polyols have a poorer resistance to solvents, chemicals, outdoor weathering and short-term weathering than comparably brittle polyols based on polyesters or polyacrylates.<br>
Mixtures of flexible and brittle polyols may be used for the production of the polyol component according to the invention.<br>
The following may be mentioned as examples of solvent-containing, solvent-free or aqueous polyols for improving the resistance properties that are suitable according to the invention:<br>

 	Unless otherwise stated the same conditions apply for polyols as in the descriptions<br>
of the polyols for the polyurethane primer above.<br>
The organic diisocyanates and/or polyisocyanates to be used in the gel-like primers<br>
according to the invention are the aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, araliphatic, aromatic and<br>
	heterocyclic diisocyanates and/or polyisocyanates known per se in polyurethane<br>
chemistry, such as are described for example by W. Siefken in Justus Liebigs<br><br><br>
22<br><br>
Annalen der Chemie, 562, pp. 75 to 136, wherein the diisocyanates may be used as monomers or in modified form,  for example biuretised,  allophanated,  carbo-diimidised, trimerised or polyol-modified.

Further examples of suitable isocyanates are the following: triphenylmethane-4,4',4"-triisocyanate, polyphenyl-polymethylene polyisocyanates such as are obtained by aniline-formaldehyde condensation followed by phosgenation, and p-isocyanato-phenylsulfonyl isocyanates, perchlorinated arylpolyisocyanates, carbodiimide group-containing polyisocyanates, norbornane diisocyanates, allophanate group-containing polyisocyanates, isocyanurate group-containing polyisocyanates, urethane group-containing polyisocyanates, polyisocyanates containing acylated urea groups, biuret group-containing   polyisocyanates,   polyisocyanates   produced   by   telomerisation reactions, ester group-containing polyisocyanates, reaction products of the afore¬mentioned isocyanates with acetals, and polyisocyanates containing polymeric fatty acid esters. These polyisocyanates suitable for the reaction are described in detail in EP-A 0 057 839. Preferred aromatic diisocyanates and triisocyanates are 2,4- and/or 2,6-toluylene diisocyanate, and 4,4'-and/or 2,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate and their modified types, as well as their multifunctional derivatives or trimerisation products produced with trihydric and tetrahydric polyols.<br>
23<br><br><br>

All the aforementioned diisocyanates and/or polyisocyanates may be used as arbitrary mixtures. The content of diisocyanates and/or polyisocyanates in the gel-forming mixtures of polyols and polyisocyanates is ca. 1 to 20 wt.%, preferably 2 to 15 wt.%, referred to the total weight of the mixture.<br>
The catalysts to be used for the reaction between hydroxyl groups and isocyanate groups in the gel formation are preferably those that are known per se in poly-urethane chemistry, for example tertiary amines such as triethylamine, N-tetra-methylenediamine, l,4-diaza-bicyclo-(2,2,2)-octane, N,N-dimethylbenzylamine, X-methyl-KI-dimethylaminoethyl piperazine, pentamethyldiethylenetriamine; also suitable as catalysts are known Mannich bases formed from secondary amines such as dimethylamine, and aldehydes (formaldehyde) or ketones (acetone) and phenols, as well as silamines with carbon-silicon bonds, for example 2,2,4-trimethyl-2-silamorpholine and 1,3-diethylaminomethyltetramethyldisiloxane.<br>

Further suitable catalysts are described in DE-A 29 20 501 on p.29, line 5, to p.31, line 25.<br>
The catalysts are preferably used in an amount of between 0.01 and 10 wt.%, referred to the total weight of the gel. All catalysts may obviously also be used in the form of mixtures.<br>
24<br><br>
The additives described in EP-A 0 057 389 (active substances, fillers, additives, auxiliary substances) may also be used according to the invention.<br>
In the hardener component according to the invention for the top layer, there are preferably used aliphatic polyisocyanates based on low viscosity polymers of 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), 4,4'-diisocyanatodicyclohexyl isocyanato-urethane (W), triisocyanatononane (NTI, TIN) or isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), which may be employed individually or in combination. If the aliphatic poly¬isocyanates do not have 1o exhibit light-fastness, then the known aromatic poly¬isocyanates may also be used (for example MDI or TDI).<br>
The following may be mentioned as examples of polyisocyanates for sole use according to the invention or for use in combinations according to the invention (solvent-containing, solvent-free or aqueous systems) in component II:<br>
1)	low viscosity polyisocyanates based on biurets of HDI with a content of 15-24 wt.% and a viscosity of 100-4000 mPa-s, such as Desmodur® N 75 and Desmodur® N 3200;<br>
2)	low viscosity trimers of HDI and their modifications with allophanate and uretdione with an NCO content of 12-25 wt.% and a viscosity of 100-4000 mPa-s, such as Desmodur® VP LS 2102, Desmodur® N 3300, Desmodur ® N 3400, Desmodur® N 3600 or Bayhydur® 3100;<br>
3)	elasticising polyisocyanates with an NCO content of 4-25 wt.% and a viscosity of 1000-10000 mPa-s, such as for example Desmodur® VP LS 2010/1 or Bayhydur® VP LS 2306;<br>
4)	triisocyanatononane with an NCO content of 48-52 wt.% at a viscosity of 10-lOOmPa-s;<br><br>
                                   25<br><br><br>
5)	mixtures of trimers of IPDI and trimers and/or the uretdione of HDI with an NCO content of 15-22 wt.% and a viscosity of 1000-5000 mPas;<br>
6)	polyisocyanates based on Hn-MDI with an NCO content of 10-33 wt.% and a viscosity of 20-10000 mPa-s, such as for example Desmodur® W;<br>
7)	blocked polyisocyanates such as Desmodur® VP LS 2253 or Desmodur® VP LS 2307;<br>
8)	as well as, similarly, the remaining polyisocyanates as described above for the polyurethane primer.<br>
The lacquers produced from the polyurethane systems according to the invention are coloured using the pigments and fillers conventionally used for lacquer production. Particularly suitable are for example inorganic pigments based on for example iron oxide (e.g. Bayferrox® 318M) or titanium dioxide (e.g. Tronox® RKB-4). All known colour effect pigments may also be used.<br>
As catalyst for the production of the top lacquers from the polyurethane systems according to the invention, there are used the known substances employed for two-component polyurethane systems, such as for example organic compounds of tin (e.g. dibutyltin dilaurate or dibutyltin diacetate) or organic compounds of zinc (e.g. zinc octoate). The amount varies depending on the system that is used, the required reaction time and the nature of the catalyst, and is between 0.01 and 3.0 wt.% of the catalyst, referred to the resin fraction of the system.<br>
The following methods may be used for example to process the systems according to the invention:<br>
The described systems may be applied by knife coating, pouring or spraying to any suitable  substrate  or  in   any  suitable  mould,  and  depending  on the  lacquer<br><br><br><br>
26<br><br>
composition are dried at room temperature or under forced conditions, for example for 10-30 minutes at 60-120°C.<br>
After the films have hardened highly elastic coatings are obtained (elongation up to<br>
 	more than 600%) with good rebound properties. The other film properties satisfy at<br>
least the usual standards in conventional polyurethane chemistry.<br>
The production of the gel primer according to the invention and containing active<br>
substances may be carried out continuously or batchwise.   The procedure depends,<br>
 	inter alia, on the shape that is to be imparted to the gels according to the invention<br>
having regard to their use. The one-shot or the prepolymer process may be employed.<br>
In the one-shot process all components, i.e. polyols, diisocyanates and/or poly-isocyanates, active substances, catalysts and optionally further fillers and additives are added in one go and intensively mixed with one another, the active substances preferably being dissolved or dispersed in the polyol components.<br>
In the prepolymer process two procedures are possible.    Either an isocyanate<br>
2)0	prepolymer is produced first of all by reacting a corresponding proportion of the<br>
polyol amount (+ active substance) of the total amount of isocyanate intended for the<br>
gel formation, and then adding the remaining amount of polyol (optionally with<br>
further active substances), as well as optionally further fillers and additives, to the<br>
prepolymer obtained and intensively mixing the whole, or the total amount of polyol<br>
2j5	(+ active substance) intended for the gel formation is reacted with part of the<br>
polyisocyanate amount to form an OH prepolymer, following which the remaining amount of polyisocyanate is mixed in.<br>
A particularly advantageous procedure according to the invention is a variant of the<br>
3J0	one-shot process and the OH-prepolymer process.  In this case the polyol or polyol<br>
mixture, the active substances, optionally the fillers and additives, the catalyst and<br><br><br>
27<br><br>
two different diisocyanates are combined in one shot and intensively mixed, one<br>
diisocyanate or polyisocyanate being aromatic in nature and one diisocyanate and/or<br>
polyisocyanate being aliphatic in nature. It may be assumed that, due to the markedly<br>
different reactivity of the two polyisocyanates, a hydroxyl prepolymer is first formed,<br>
 	which then reacts within a few minutes with the other polyisocyanate with gel<br>
formation. Gels with a particularly high toughness are thereby obtained.<br>
In these procedures the conveying, metering in and mixing of the individual<br>
components or component mixtures may be performed using equipment known per<br>
 	se to the person skilled in the art in polyurethane chemistry.<br>
If for example mouldings are to be produced for direct use, then the batch procedure<br>
is preferred.   If however the polyurethane gel according to the invention is to be<br>
produced in unit pieces of suitable dimensions, then a continuous procedure is often<br>
 	more favourable. In this case an endless film or sheet is first of all produced, which<br>
can then be cut up into individual pieces and lacquered.<br>
With continuous production the gellable mixture  optionally containing active<br>
substances can also be sprayed, poured or knife coated before it has solidified due to<br>
 	the gel formation. The gellable mixture containing active substances can be applied<br>
to a very wide variety of materials based on natural or synthetic raw materials, for example to mats, fleece, knitted fabrics, hosiery, expanded films, plastics films or sheets, or may be cast in desired shapes.<br>
	The invention also provides for the use of the coatings systems according to the<br>
invention in the IMC (in-mould coating) process.<br>
In the IMC process the component II)<br>
 	a)        is applied (by spraying, knife coating, brush application, etc.) to one or both<br>
halves of the mould (depending on the arrangement and articles to be formed)<br><br><br>
28<br><br><br>
and is gently dried (preferably at room temperature or slightly elevated temperatures). The component I) is then added to the mould by the methods described above, hardened together with the component II), following which the coated moulding is removed from the mould,<br>
b) is subsequently injected (after the production of the component I)) into a defined gap in the mould (possible only in the solvent-free variant) and is then hardened together with component I), and<br>
 	c)        the composite produced from a) and b) is then applied to the object to be<br>
coated.<br>
In a particular embodiment the objects to be coated may also be introduced into a mould and then coated according to the invention in the latter.<br>
The conditions during the gel formation can also be varied so that either compact or foamed gels are obtained. If for example air is injected into the gellable mixture, then foamed gels are obtained.<br>
 	Objects can also be moulded according to the invention, for example by decanting<br>
the body to be moulded together with a gel-forming composition and removing the moulding after the gel formation.<br><br><br><br>
According to the invention multilayer coatings can be produced from a gel-like primer with a layer thickness of 30 um-10 mm, and a top layer of polyurethane lacquer with a layer thickness of 5 um-2 mm.<br><br><br>
 	Multilayer coatings can be produced using the coating systems according to the<br>
invention by the following steps, the order of which is not fixed:<br><br><br>

Examples of polyurethane primer<br>
Examples 1 to 10 of EP-A 57838 were used for the primer.<br>
The wording of Examples 1 to 10 of EP-A 57838 is as follows:<br>
34<br><br><br><br>
Example 1 rfrom EP-A 57 838)<br>
3500 parts of a polyether based on trimethylolpropane with a hydroxyl number of 56, produced from 45% propylene oxide and 55% ethylene oxide, 700 parts of a polyether based on trimethylolpropane with a hydroxyl number of 34, produced from 83% propylene oxide and 17% ethylene oxide, and 2800 parts of a polyether based on propylene glycol with a hydroxyl number of 56, produced from 100%) propylene oxide, are stirred at a temperature of 22 °C by means of a laboratory mixer equipped with a stirring disc to form a clear solution. 301 parts of a biuret polyisocyanate with<br>
 	an isocyanate content of 21 wt.%, a mean functionality of 3.6 and a mean molecular<br>
weight of 700, which was produced by biuretisation reaction from hexamethylene diisocyanates (Desmodur N® from Bayer AG) are added to this solution while stirring and thoroughly distributed. 105 parts of dibutyltin dilaurate are added to the now turbid solution and the mixture is intensively mixed for 3 minutes. The whitish<br>
 	turbid solution is poured into a prepared square casing of polyurethane film of film<br>
thickness 0.2 mm with an edge length of 45 cm and the film casing is sealed in an airtight manner. The thus prepared gel cushion is placed on a flat support and left by itself for the gel reaction to take place, following which the gel cushion reaches its mechanical  final  strength and can be fully loaded.     The cushion is a soft,<br>
 	dimensionally stable body deformable under pressure.  When the deforming force is<br>
lifted, the gel cushion returns to its original state.<br>
Under loading with an artificial seat made from plastics material and loaded with a 35 kg weight, a pressure of 44 pressure units (PU) is measured on the crosspiece and a pressure of 48 PU is measured on the seat leg projections.<br>
Example 2 (Comparison Example from EP-A 57 838)<br>
A foam cushion made from a commercially available polyether foam with a bulk<br>
 	density according to DIN 53 420 of 35 kg/m3 and a compressive strength (40%)<br>
according to DIN 53 571 of 3.3 KPa, as is conventionally used for the production of<br><br><br>
35<br><br><br>
cushion units and mattresses, is provided with a film covering of polyurethane film, such as is used in Example 1. The cushion covered in this way is loaded similarly to Example 1 with an artificial seat.    A pressure of 109 PU is measured on the crosspiece and a pressure of 34 PU is measured on the seat leg projection.  <br>
Example 3 (from EP-A 57 838)<br>
A  gel-forming mixture  is produced  according to  the procedure  described in<br>
Example 1 and is poured, similarly to Example 1, into a square covering made of<br>
 	elastic film. However, instead of being fabricated from a 0.2 mm thick polyurethane<br>
film, the covering is fabricated from a polymer blend consisting of 50 parts of polypropylene and 50 parts of a styrene-butadiene block copolymer.<br>
After the gel reaction  is complete,  a soft,  dimensionally stable  gel  cushion<br>
 	deformable under pressure is obtained, which after deformation returns to its original<br>
state when the deforming force is lifted.<br>
The gel cushion obtained in this way is loaded similarly to Example 1 with an<br>
artificial seat. A pressure of 18 PU is measured on the crosspiece and a pressure of<br>
 	19 PU is measured on the seat leg projections.<br>
Example 4 (from EP-A 57 838)<br>
A  gel-forming mixture is produced  according to  the procedure  described  in<br>
 	Example 1 and poured similarly to Example 1 into a square covering.   However,<br>
instead of being fabricated from polyurethane film the covering is fabricated from an elastic textile provided with an elastic polyurethane coating, such as is generally customary and known for example in the manufacture of corsetry or bathwear.<br>
 	After the gel reaction is complete a soft, dimensionally stable gel cushion deformable<br>
under pressure is obtained, which after deformation returns to its original state when<br><br><br>
36<br><br>
the deforming force is lifted. The gel cushion obtained in this way is loaded similarly to Example 1 with an artificial seat. A pressure of 32 PU is measured on the crosspiece projection and a pressure of 28 PU on the seat leg projections.<br>
 	Example 5 (from EP-A 57 838)<br><br><br>
3500 parts of a polyether based on trimethylolpropane with a hydroxyl number of 56, produced from 45% propylene oxide and 55% ethylene oxide, 700 parts of a polyether based on trimethylolpropane with a hydroxyl number of 34, produced from 83% propylene oxide and 17% ethylene oxide, and 2800 parts of a polyether based on propylene glycol with a hydroxyl number of 56, produced from 100% propylene oxide, and 35 parts of dibutyltin dilaurate are homogeneously mixed in a stirrer vessel at 22°C. The mixture is added by means of a gear-type pump to a static mixer. 273 parts of the biuret polyisocyanate from Example 1 are added at the same time from a separate storage container to this mixer using a further gear-type pump so that the mixing ratio of the two components is equal at all times and corresponds to the ratio of the total amounts.<br>
The whitish turbid solution flowing out from the static mixer is poured into a square<br>
 	covering, as was described in Example 4, and a gel cushion in the form of a pillow is<br>
made therefrom as described in Example 1.<br>
After the gel reaction is complete, a soft, dimensionally stable gel cushion de-<br>
formable under pressure is obtained, which after deformation returns to its original<br>
 	state when the deforming force is lifted.<br>
The gel cushion obtained in this way is loaded with an artificial seat as described in Example 1. The following pressure values are measured: crossleg projection 31 PU; seat leg projections 23 PU.<br><br><br>
37<br><br><br><br><br>
Example 6 (from EP-A 57 838)<br>
1000 parts of a polyether based on trimethylolpropane with a hydroxyl number of 35, produced from 80% propylene oxide and 20% ethylene oxide, 50 parts of the biuret polyisocyanate from Example 1, and 15 parts of dibutyltin dilaurate are intensively mixed within 1 minute at room temperature using a laboratory stirrer with a stirring disc. After 10 minutes an opaque, elastic, colour-stable gel is obtained which can easily be deformed under the influence of a force acting thereupon and which adopts its original state after the deforming force is lifted.<br>
The gel is particularly suitable for producing gel cushions.<br>
Example 7 (from EP-A 57 838)<br><br>
	1000 parts of a polyether based on sorbitol with a hydroxyl number of 46, produced<br>
from 100% propylene oxide, 25 parts of toluylene diisocyanate (80% 2,4-isomer and 20% 2,6-isomer) and 30 parts of dibutyltin dilaurate are intensively mixed within 1 minute at room temperature using a laboratory stirrer with a stirring disc. A soft, elastic, dimensionally stable gel is obtained which can easily be deformed under the<br>
 	influence of a force acting thereupon and which returns to its original state after the<br>
deforming force is lifted.<br>
The gel is likewise particularly suitable for producing gel cushions.<br>

A soft, elastic, dimen¬sionally stable gel is obtained which can easily be deformed under the influence of a<br><br>
38<br><br><br>
force acting thereupon and which returns to its original state after the deforming force is lifted.<br>
The gel is likewise suitable for producing gel cushions.  <br>
Example 9 (from EP-A 57 838)<br><br>
1000 parts of a polyether based on glycerol with a hydroxyl number of 28, produced from 40% propylene oxide and 60% ethylene oxide, are reacted with 50 parts of the polyisocyanate according to Example 8 and 30 parts of dibutyltin dilaurate analogously to Example 7 to form a soft, elastic, dimensionally stable gel that can easily be deformed under the influence of a force acting thereupon and which returns to its original state after the deforming force is lifted. The gel is likewise suitable for producing gel cushions.<br><br>
Example 10 (from EP-A 57 838)<br>
The example illustrates the co-use of plasticisers. 490 parts of a polyether based on trimethylolpropane with a hydroxyl number of 56, produced from 45% propylene<br>
 	oxide and 55% ethylene oxide, 480 parts of dibutyltin adipate, 30 parts of the<br>
isocyanate according to Example 1 and 15 parts of dibutyltin dilaurate are reacted according to Example 7 to form a soft, elastic, dimensionally stable gel that can easily be deformed under the influence of a force acting thereupon and which returns to its original state after the deforming force is lifted. The gel may likewise be used<br>
	to produce gel cushions.<br>
39<br><br><br>
Use examples:<br>
1.        Multilayer IMC process<br>
The top layer material according to the invention (component II) is produced by permanent stirring, for example by means of a high-speed stirrer or blade agitator (e.g. pneumatic stirrer 756D3 from Otto Bock Healthcare). Care must be taken to ensure that all of the additives for providing surface quality, such as for example dulling agents, rheology improvers, crack and scratch-resistance improvers, lubricants, coloured pigments and as well as materials known in lacquer technology are homogeneously incorporated while avoiding agglomerates. In order to ensure that a transparent or translucent top layer can be produced care must be taken to ensure before the processing of component II that no more air bubbles are contained in component II. In order to ensure that component II according to the invention can later be readily removed from the moulds the mould surfaces are sprayed with release agents known in PU technology.<br>
Component II is introduced into the preheated mould by means of commercially available coating guns (e.g. coating set 746B20 from Otto Bock Healthcare, Duderstadt). Care must be taken to ensure that accumulations of material are avoided, since these affect the appearance and haptic properties of the surface. The injection and material pressure of the injection device must be adjusted in such a manner that the required top layer thickness and the required surface properties are obtained.<br>
Component II must be aired until no more solvent is detected (finger and smell test). The airing or drying of component II can be accelerated by the application of heat.<br>
In the IMC process the following structures are possible:<br>
40<br><br>
both mould halves are coated in several layers with component II, if necessary with the aid of covering templates. After component II has dried the mould is closed manually or semi- or fully automatically with the aid of commercially available closing units and locked. Component I is introduced into the closed mould by means of low pressure machines customary for PU technology. In order to prevent air bubbles forming in the moulding the risers and the sprue must be adapted to correspond to the geometrical dimensions concerned. As soon as component II has completely reacted the mould is opened and the moulding removed. In order to ensure that the final strength of components I and II is obtained the moulding must be tempered for a further 72 hours at ambient temperature or for a correspondingly shorter time in a hot-air oven at about 40 to 80°C.<br>
The two- or multi-part mould halves are coated as described in section 1 a. On one mould half a supporting insert consisting for example of wood, plastic, metal or another material or combinations of the aforesaid materials, is for example fixed. The mould is closed and the insert is surrounded with component I. The adhesive bond between component I and the insert must be examined and possibly improved using commercially available primers or adhesion promoters. In order to obtain the final strength of components I and II the moulding must be tempered for a further 72 hours at ambient temperature or for a correspondingly shorter time in a hot-air oven at about 40 to 80°C. The following structure is obtained:<br>
a top layer according to the invention (component II) a gel layer according to the invention (component I) the moulding support<br>
a gel layer according to the invention (component I) a top layer according to the invention (component II)<br>
41<br><br><br>
c) A further possible variant is that a moulding support of the materials already mentioned under lb) is fixed to one mould half. The. two mould halves are closed and injected with component 1. The following structure is obtained:<br>
 	a top layer according to the invention (component II)<br>
a gel layer according to the invention (component I) the moulding support<br>
In order to ensure that the final strength of components I and II is obtained the<br>
 	moulding must be tempered for a further 72 hours at ambient temperature or<br>
tempered for a correspondingly shorter time in a hot-air oven at about 40 to 80°C.<br>
2.	Slash process<br>
 	In the slash process the solvent-free component II according to the invention is<br>
introduced into one mould half and then the mould is closed as described under section 1 a. The mould is swivelled according to its geometrical dimensions so that a top layer thickness is obtained which is as uniform as possible. As soon as component II according to the invention has completely reacted, which can be<br>
 	hastened  by heating,  component I  is  injected into the  mould  by means  of<br>
commercially available 2-component machines. Here as well corresponding risers must be taken into account. In order to ensure that the final strength of components I and II is obtained the moulding must be tempered for a further 72 hours at ambient temperature or for a correspondingly shorter time in a hot-air oven at about 40 to<br>
	80°C.<br>
3.        Immersion process<br>
In the immersion process contoured parts of component I with or without inserts or<br>
 	moulding supports are produced in the first step. As soon as component 1 has fully<br>
reacted the moulding is removed. After it is cleaned the moulding is immersed in a<br><br><br>
42<br><br>
dipping basin filled with component II. Component II must be adjusted with one or more solvents so that the required layer thickness of component II is obtained. By adding special additives of the kind customary in general lacquer technology the external lacquer appearance is influenced.   In the immersion process care must be<br>
 	taken to ensure that component II is absolutely free of air inclusions since these lead<br>
to considerable surface defects. In order to ensure that the final strength of components I and II is obtained the moulding must be tempered for a further 72 hours at ambient temperature or for a correspondingly shorter time in a hot-air oven at about 40 to 80°C.<br><br>
4.        Knife-coating process<br>
Component II according to the invention is knife-coated in one or more coats onto a<br>
substrate, such as for example smooth and/or structured paper, sheets, metal sheets,<br>
 	metal and plastic panels, etc. by means of a stationary or a moving knife.   The<br>
surfaces to be knife-coated must be pretreated in such a manner that after the production process component II can be readily removed. This can be achieved for example by release agents based on silicone or by coating the surfaces concerned with Teflon.  All surface finishes known in PU technology can also be used.  After<br>
 	sufficiently airing component II, component I according to the invention is applied.<br>
This process allows continuous operation. After component I has been introduced the remaining surface can be laminated with any conceivable rigid and flexible top layers. Top layers in this connection are understood to be for example textiles with or without film coatings, three-dimensional knitted fabrics, leather, films of all types<br>
 	[see the book by Nentwig, "Kunststoff Folien" (Plastic films), Hanser Verlag: ISBN<br>
3-446-17598-9: PE, PP, PET, PVC, PU, PA, etc. and combinations thereof], metal sheets, metal panels, plastic panels, etc. Due to the structure in the surface to be coated with component II the end product is provided with a corresponding copy of the surface structure.<br><br>
43<br><br><br>
5.        Coating process<br>
In this process the mouldings of component I to be coated with component II according to the invention are produced in a first step according to section 3. Since component I is self-adhesive all shape-providing surfaces must be coated with release agents or Teflon coatings of the kind known in PU technology. The mouldings to be coated with component II are removed from the shape-providing moulds and then coated with component II using commercially available injection guns. Component II can be applied in several layers in order to obtain the required layer thickness. The outer top layer must be provided with the additive described in section I with regard to the desired surface quality. In order to ensure that the final strength of components I and II is obtained the moulding must be tempered for a further 72 hours at ambient temperature or for a correspondingly shorter period in a hot-air oven at about 40 to 80°C.<br>
6.1 IMC/gel/PU foam<br>
In this process component II is injected into the mould halves according to section 1 and the corresponding subsections. As soon as component II has been sufficiently aired, component I is introduced into the recesses provided therefor. As soon as component I has completely reacted the mould halves are closed and locked. A flexible, semi-rigid, integral, rigid or reaction injection moulding (RIM) foam is introduced into the closed mould. Here it is possible to use or not to use inserts or moulding supports, as described under sections la and lb. After the components have cured the moulding is removed and tempered by the above method.<br>
44<br><br>
6.2 IMC/PU foam<br>
In this process the procedure according to section 6.1 is used, with the exception of component I.<br>
7.0      Surface-coated PU foam<br>
In this process commercially available cut and moulded foams, such as for example composite, cold-curing, integral, pressed, PVC or viscoelastic foams, etc. are subsequently surface-coated with component II according to the invention using a spray gun. The surface can be varied by varying the parameters (the material and spraying pressure) of the spray gun, so that for example a porous or non-porous hard-wearing skin is applied to the foam concerned.<br>
