DESCRIPTION<br>
CYCLIC AMINE COMPOONDS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a cyclic amine compound<br>
useful as an androgen receptor modulator and the like.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Androgen is synthesized in the testis and adrenal cortex,<br>
bound to an androgen receptor in a target organ, and shows<br>
various physiological activities. Chemically, any natural<br>
androgen belongs to C19 steroid. The major androgen among them<br>
is testosterone mainly synthesized in the testis, uptaken in a<br>
target cell and shows strong physiological activity. In female,<br>
adrenal cortex is a major androgen supply source.<br>
Androgen is involved in the growth and function<br>
maintenance of genital organ (prostate, vesicular gland,<br>
epididymis, vas deferens etc.), sex differentiation in the<br>
embryonic stage, spermatozoon formation, expression of secondary<br>
sexual characteristics (induction of masculinization, for<br>
example, muscle-skeleton, voice, fat distribution etc., and the<br>
like), promotion of protein elaboration in muscle and the like,<br>
bone metabolism and the like. Therefore, shortage of androgen<br>
due to testis dysfunction, castration and the like results in<br>
insufficient actions mentioned above, thus leading to various<br>
diseases and degraded QOL (quality of life). To deal with the<br>
situation, an androgen replacement therapy is generally employed.<br>
Besides testosterone, synthetic androgen showing different<br>
balance of androgenic action has been studied and put to<br>
practical use in clinical situations.<br>
On the other hand, when androgen is involved in the<br>
progression of pathology, an androgen deprivation therapy is<br>
employed. For example, in androgen dependent prostate cancer,<br>
castration and administration of GnRH agonist decrease<br>
testosterone and increase a treatment effect.<br>
For androgen replacement therapy, testosterone and<br>
synthetic androgen are generally used. However, they have a<br><br>
steroid skeleton, which places much burden on the liver or shows<br>
other steroid hormone action. Therefore, an androgen receptor<br>
modulator (particularly agonist) having a non-steroidal skeleton<br>
is considered to be useful for the improvement of pathology<br>
caused by insufficient androgen action (hypogonadism, male<br>
climacteric disorder and the like) and pathology expected to<br>
show improvement by the action of androgen (osteoporosis and the<br>
like).<br>
It is known that a naphthalene derivative having a<br>
pyrrolidine ring has a superior androgen receptor modulator<br>
action (WO 2004/16576). However, this reference does not<br>
disclose a pyrrolidinobenzene derivative having a substituent at<br>
the 3-position of pyrrolidine ring.<br>
While a benzene derivative having a pyrrolidine ring,<br>
which shows an anti-androgen action (JP 2002-88073 A and WO<br>
2005/090282), and a benzene derivative having a pyrrolidine ring,<br>
which is used for osteoporosis and the like (WO 2005/108351) are<br>
known, a compound having a substituent at the 3-position of a<br>
pyrrolidine ring is not disclosed.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
The present invention aims to provide a compound having a<br>
more superior androgen receptor modulating action.<br>
Means of Solving the Problems<br>
The present inventors have conducted intensive studies in<br>
view of the aforementioned problems and found that a cyclic<br>
aminobenzene compound represented by the formula (I)<br>

The compound (I) of the present invention or a salt<br>
thereof or a prodrug thereof (hereinafter sometimes to be<br>
abbreviated as the compound of the present invention) has an<br>
androgen receptor modulating action, particularly an androgen<br>
receptor agonistic action, and can be used for the prophylaxis<br>
or treatment of diseases in mammals, for which administration of<br>
an androgen receptor agonist is effective. The diseases for<br>
which administration of an androgen receptor agonist is<br>
effective include hypogonadism, osteoporosis, hormone resistant<br>
cancer (particularly 1HRH agonist resistant cancer), climacteric<br>
disorder (particularly male climacteric disorder), frailty,<br>
cachexia, anemia, arteriosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease,<br>
erectile dysfunction, depression, wasting disease,<br>
hypertriglyceridemia (hyperlipidemia) and the like.<br>
Particularly, it is used for the prophylaxis or treatment of<br>
hypogonadism, male climacteric disorder, frailty, cachexia or<br>
osteoporosis.<br>
The compound of the present invention has a tissue-<br>
selective androgen receptor modulating action and shows, for<br>
example, an antagonistic action on the prostate and an agonistic<br>
action on the muscle. Specifically, the compound of the present<br>
invention shows an action to not increase the weight of the<br><br>
prostate at a dose that increases the weight of the muscle (e.g.,<br>
levator ani muscle and the like). More specifically, it<br>
increases the prostate weight by about 10% or less (preferably<br>
0% or less) at a dose that increases the levator ani muscle<br>
weight by about 20% or more (preferably about 20% to about 50%).<br>
Here, referring to the "increase in the prostate weight of 0% or<br>
less", an increase of 0% means that the prostate weight does not<br>
increase or decrease, and an increase of less than 0% means that<br>
the prostate weight decreases by the absolute value thereof.<br>
Accordingly, the compound of the present invention can be used<br>
as a pharmaceutical agent shown below.<br>
(1)	A frailty suppressant.<br>
(2)	A muscle strength enhancer or muscle increasing agent<br>
(providing effects of no bedridden aged patients, shortened<br>
rehabilitation period and the like).<br>
(3)	A suppressant of cachexia caused by, for example, AIDS,<br>
cancer and the like.<br>
(4)	A body weight decrease suppressant.<br>
(5)	An agent for the prophylaxis or treatment of prostate<br>
hypertrophy (that decreases the prostate weight).<br>
(6)	An agent for the prophylaxis or treatment of amyotrophy.<br>
(7)	An agent for reducing prostate weight.<br>
(8)	An agent for the prophylaxis or treatment of muscle loss<br>
caused by diseases (e.g., muscular dystrophy, muscular atrophy,<br>
X-linkage spinal cord medulla oblongata muscular atrophy (SBMA),<br>
cachexia, malnutrition, Hansen's disease, diabetes, renal<br>
disease, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases), cancer,<br>
terminal renal failure, sarcopenia (loss of muscle due to<br>
advancing age), emphysema, osteomalacia, HIV infection, AIDS,<br>
cardiomyopathy and the like).<br>
(9)	A suppressant of loss of muscle strength in postmenopausal<br>
female.<br>
(10)	A suppressant of bone mineral density of postmenopausal<br>
female.<br><br>
(11)	A suppressant of hot flash (e.g., glow, sweating and the<br>
like) in postmenopausal female.<br>
(12)	An agent for reducing the side effects of 1HRH modulators<br>
such as 1HRH agonists (leuprorelin, goserelin, buserelin,<br>
nafarelin, triptorelin, gonadorelin and the like), 1HRH<br>
antagonists (ganirelix, cetrorelix, antarelix, abarelix,<br>
sufugolix and the like) and the like.<br>
(13)	A suppressant of loss of muscle strength after<br>
administration of a pharmaceutical agent such as an 1HRH<br>
modulator and the like.<br>
(14)	A suppressant of decreased bone mineral density after<br>
administration of a pharmaceutical agent such as an 1HRH<br>
modulator and the like.<br>
(15)	A suppressant of hot flash (e.g., glow, sweating and the<br>
like) after administration of a pharmaceutical agent such as an<br>
1HRH modulator and the like.<br>
In addition, the compound of the present invention shows<br>
effect as a frailty suppressant, a muscle strength enhancer or a<br>
muscle increasing agent while using as an agent for the<br>
prophylaxis or treatment of prostate hypertrophy or an agent for<br>
reducing the weight of the prostate. Accordingly, it is<br>
expected to shorten the period of rehabilitation without leaving<br>
aged inpatients bedridden. Without the side effect of<br>
increasing the weight of the prostate, it is expected to provide<br>
an agent for the prophylaxis or treatment of prostate cancer in<br>
patients with high possibility of prostate cancer. Without the<br>
side effect of virilization, moreover, it can be applied to<br>
female, and is expected to provide a suppressant of loss of<br>
muscle strength or bone mineral density loss in postmenopausal<br>
female, or a suppressant of hot flash (glow, sweating etc.) in<br>
postmenopausal female. Furthermore, it also is expected as an<br>
agent for reducing the side effects of 1HRH agonists<br>
(leuprorelin, goserelin, buserelin, nafarelin, triptorelin,<br>
gonadorelin and the like), and 1HRH antagonists (ganirelix,<br>
cetrorelix, antarelix, abarelix, sufugolix and the like), a<br><br>
suppressant of loss of muscle strength or bone mineral density<br>
loss after administration of these pharmaceutical agents, or a<br>
suppressant of hot flash (glow, sweating and the like) after<br>
administration of these pharmaceutical agents.<br>
The compound of the present invention achieves growth<br>
inhibition and cell death by conversely placing an excessive<br>
stimulation on cancer that has acquired resistance to a hormone<br>
treatment by being hypersensitive to androgen. Thus, it can be<br>
used as an agent for the prophylaxis or treatment of, from<br>
various cancers, breast cancer, prostate cancer, endometrial<br>
cancer, cancer of the uterine cervix, ovarian cancer, urinary<br>
bladder cancer, thyroid cancer, bone tumor and penile cancer,<br>
that acquired hormone resistance, and is particularly useful as<br>
an agent for the prophylaxis or treatment of prostate cancer.<br>
As hormone resistant cancer, for example, 1HRH derivative<br>
resistant cancer, preferably 1HRH agonist resistant cancer can<br>
be mentioned.<br>

particle which is the core of the nucleus while spraying a<br>
binder dissolved in a suitable solvent such as water, lower<br>
alcohol (e.g., methanol, ethanol and the like) and the like, a<br><br>
pan coating method, a fluidized bed coating method or a melt<br>
granulating method. As the inert carrier particle, for example,<br>
those made of sucrose, lactose, starch, crystalline cellulose or<br>
waxes can be used, and the average particle size thereof is<br>
preferably from about 100 µm to about 1500 µm.<br>
For separating a drug contained in a nucleus and a film<br>
agent, the surface of the nucleus may be coated with a<br>
protective agent. As the protective agent, for example, the<br>
above-mentioned hydrophilic substances, water-insoluble<br>
substances and the like are used. As the protective agent,<br>
preferably polyethylene glycol, and polysaccharides having<br>
hydroxyalkyl or carboxyalkyl are used, more preferably,<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and hydroxypropylcellulose are used.<br>
The protective agent may contain, as stabilizer, acids such as -<br>
tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, maleic<br>
acid and the like, and lubricants such as talc and the like.<br>
When the protective agent is used, the coating amount is from<br>
about 1 to about 15% (w/w), preferably from about 1 to about 10%<br>
(w/w), further preferably from about 2 to about 8% (w/w), based<br>
on the nucleus.<br>
The protective agent can be coated by a usual coating<br>
method, and specifically, the protective agent can be coated by<br>
spray-coating the nucleus, for example, by a fluidized bed<br>
coating method, pan coating method and the like.<br>
II. Coating of nucleus with film agent<br>
A nucleus obtained in the above-mentioned step I is coated<br>
with a film agent solution obtained by heat-solving the above-<br>
mentioned water-insoluble substance and pH-dependent swellable<br>
polymer, and a hydrophilic substance, or by dissolving or<br>
dispersing them in a solvent, to give a sustained release<br>
preparation.<br>
As the method for coating a nucleus with a film agent<br>
solution, for example, a spray coating method and the like are<br>
listed.<br><br>
The composition ratio of a water-insoluble substance,<br>
swellable polymer or hydrophilic substance in a film agent<br>
solution is appropriately selected so that the contents of these<br>
components in a coated film are the above-mentioned contents,<br>
respectively.<br>
The coating amount of a film agent is from about 1 to<br>
about 90% (w/w), preferably from about 5 to about 50% (w/w),<br>
further preferably from about 5 to about 35% (w/w), based on a<br>
nucleus (not including coating amount of protective agent).<br>
As the solvent in a film agent solution, water or an<br>
organic solvent can be used alone or in admixture thereof. In<br>
the case of use in admixture, the mixing ratio of water to an<br>
organic solvent (water/organic solvent: by weight) can be varied<br>
in the range from 1 to 100%, and is preferably from 1 to about<br>
30%. The organic solvent is not particularly restricted<br>
providing it dissolves a water-insoluble substance, and for<br>
example, lower alcohols such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol,<br>
isopropyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol and the like, lower alkanone<br>
such as acetone and the like, acetonitrile, chloroform,<br>
methylene chloride and the like are used. Among them, lower<br>
alcohols are preferable, and ethyl alcohol and isopropyl alcohol<br>
are particularly preferable. Water, and a mixture of water with<br>
an organic solvent are preferably used as a solvent for a film<br>
agent. In this case, if necessary, an acid such as tartaric<br>
acid, citric acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid and<br>
the like may also be added into a film agent solution for<br>
stabilizing the film agent solution.<br>
An operation of coating by spray coating can be effected<br>
by a usual coating method, and specifically, it can be performed<br>
by spray-coating a film agent solution onto a nucleus by a<br>
fluidized bed coating method, pan coating method and the like.<br>
In this case, if necessary, talc, titanium oxide, magnesium<br>
stearate, calcium stearate, light anhydrous silicic acid and the<br>
like may also be added as a lubricant, and glycerin fatty acid<br><br>
ester, hydrogenated castor oil, triethyl citrate, cetyl alcohol,<br>
stearyl alcohol and the like may also be added as a plasticizer.<br>
After coating with a film agent, if necessary, an<br>
antistatic agent such as talc and the like may be mixed.<br>
The immediate-release preparation may be liquid (solution,<br>
suspension, emulsion and the like) or solid (particle, pill,<br>
tablet and the like). Oral agents and parenteral agents such as<br>
an injection and the like are used, and oral agents are<br>
preferable.<br>
The immediate-release preparation, usually, may contain,<br>
in addition to an active component drug, also carriers,<br>
additives and excipients conventionally used in the production<br>
field (hereinafter, sometimes abbreviated as excipient). The<br>
preparation excipient to be used is not particularly restricted<br>
providing it is an excipient ordinarily used as a preparation<br>
excipient. For example, as the excipient for an oral solid<br>
preparation, lactose, starch, corn starch, crystalline cellulose<br>

preferably from about 20 to about 98.5 w/w%, further preferably<br>
from about 30 to' about 97 w/w%, based on the total amount of the<br>
immediate-release preparation.<br>
The content of a drug in the immediate-release preparation<br>
can be appropriately selected in the range from about 0.5 to<br>
about 95%, preferably from about 1 to about 60% based on the<br>
total amount of the immediate-release preparation.<br>
When the immediate-release preparation is an oral solid<br>
preparation, it usually contains, in addition to the above-<br>
mentioned components, also an integrating agent. As this<br>
integrating agent, for example, carboxymethylcellulose calcium<br><br>
(ECG-505, manufactured by Gotoku Yakuhin), croscarmelose sodium<br>
(e.g., Actisol, manufactured by Asahi Kasei Corporation),<br>
crospovidone (e.g., Kollidon CL, manufactured by BASF), low<br>
substituted hydroxypropylcellulose (manufactured by Shin-Etsu<br>
Chemical Co., Ltd.), carboxymethylstarch (manufactured by<br>
Matsutani Kagaku K.K.), carboxymethylstarch sodium (Exprotab,<br>

(PCS, manufactured by Asahi Kasei Corporation), and the like are<br>
used, and for example, those which disintegrate a granule by<br>
adsorbing water in contact with water, causing swelling, or<br>
making a channel between an effective ingredient constituting<br>
the nucleus and an excipient, can be used. These disintegrating<br>
agents can be used alone or in combination of two or more. The<br>
amount of the disintegrating agent to be used is appropriately<br>
selected depending on the kind and blending amount of a drug to<br>
be used, design of releasing property, and the like, and for<br>
example, from about 0.05 to about 30 w/w%, preferably from about<br>
0.5 to about 15 w/w%, based on the total amount of the quick<br>
releasing agent.<br>
When the immediate-release preparation is an oral solid<br>
preparation, it may further contain, in addition to the above-<br>
mentioned composition, if desired, additives conventional in<br>
solid preparations. As such an additive, there are used, for<br>
example, a binder (e.g., sucrose, gelatin, gum Arabic powder,<br>
methylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, pullulan, dextrin and the like), a<br>
lubricant (e.g., polyethylene glycol, magnesium stearate, talc,<br>
light anhydrous silicic acid (e.g., Aerosil (Nippon Aerosil)), a<br>
surfactant (e.g., anionic surfactants such as sodium<br>
alkylsulfate and the like, nonionic surfactants such as<br>
polyoxyethylene fatty acid ester and polyoxyethylene sorbitan<br>
fatty acid ester, polyoxyethylene castor oil derivatives and the<br>

acid and the like may also be added.<br>
As the above-mentioned binder, hydroxypropylcellulose,<br>
polyethylene glycol and polyvinylpyrrolidone and the like are<br>
preferably used.<br>
The immediate-release preparation can be prepared by,<br>
based on a usual technology of producing preparations, mixing<br>
the above-mentioned components, and if necessary, further<br>
kneading the mixture, and molding it. The above-mentioned<br>
mixing is conducted by generally used methods, for example,<br>
mixing, kneading and the like. Specifically, when a immediate-<br>
release preparation is formed, for example, into a particle, it<br>
can be prepared, according to the same means as in the above-<br>
mentioned method for preparing a nucleus of a sustained release<br>
preparation, by mixing the components using a vertical<br>
granulator, universal kneader (manufactured by Hata Tekkosho),<br>
fluidized bed granulator FD-5S (manufactured by Powrex<br>
Corporation), and the like, and then, granulating the mixture by<br>
a wet extrusion granulation method, fluidized bed granulation<br>
method and the like.<br>
Thus obtained immediate-release preparation and sustained<br>
release preparation may be themselves made into preparations or<br>
made into preparations appropriately together with preparation<br>
excipients and the like, separately, by an ordinary method, then,<br>
may be administered simultaneously or may be administered in<br>
combination at any administration interval, or they may be<br>
themselves made into one oral preparation (e.g., granule, fine<br>
particle, tablet, capsule and the like) or made into one oral<br>
preparation appropriately together with preparation excipients<br>
and the like. It may also be permissible that they are made<br>
into granules or fine particles, and filled in the same capsule<br>
to be used as a preparation for oral administration.<br><br>

The dosage of a combination agent of the present invention<br>
differs depending on the kind of a compound of the present<br>
invention, age, body weight, condition, drug form,<br>
administration method, administration period and the like, and<br>
for example, for one prostate cancer patient (adult, body<br>

division a day. Of course, since the dosage as described above<br>
varies depending on various conditions, amounts smaller than the<br>
above-mentioned dosage may sometimes be sufficient, further,<br>
amounts over that range sometimes have to be administered.<br>
The amount of the concomitant drug can be set at any value<br>
unless side effects are problematical. The daily dosage in<br>

present invention is administered after the first administration<br>
of the concomitant drugs or vice versa, though they may be<br>
administered simultaneously. When administered at a time<br>
interval, the interval differs depending on the effective<br>
ingredient to be administered, drug form and administration<br>
method, and for example, when the concomitant drug is<br>

chromatography). In the TLC observation, Kieselgel 6OF254 plate<br>
(Merck) was used as a TLC plate, the solvent used as an elution<br>
solvent in the column chromatography was used as a developing<br>
solvent, and the means of detection used was an UV detector. As<br>
silica gel for column, Kieselgel 60F254 (70-230 mesh)<br>
manufactured by Merck again or Purif-Pack (SI 60 µm), Purif-Pack<br>
(NH 60 µm) manufactured by MORITEX was used. NMR spectra are<br>
shown by proton NMR with tetramethylsilane as the internal<br>
standard, using VARIAN Gemini-200 (200 MHz type spectrometer),<br>
VARIAN Mercury-300 (300 MHz) or JMTCO400/54 (400 MHz type) (JEOL<br>
Ltd.); 8 values are expressed in ppm. The reaction using a<br>
microwave reaction apparatus was performed using Emrys Optimizer<br>
manufactured by Biotage. The infrared absorption spectrum (IR)<br>
was measured using Paragon 1000 manufactured by PerkinElmer.<br>
The melting point was measured using MPA100 type melting point<br>
measurement apparatus, Optimelt, manufactured by Stanford<br>
