Production of zeaxanthin by Phoffia<br>
The present invention relates to production of xanthophyll carotenoids, especially zeaxanthin and β-cryptotoxanthin by microorganism belonging to genus Phaffia.<br>
More particularly, the present invention provides a process for producing xanthophyll carotenoids, especially zeaxanthin and 3-cryptoxanthin by genetically modified recombinant microorganism belonging to genus Phaffia.<br>
By using methods of the present invention, it becomes possible to produce the useful<br>
xanthophyll carotenoids other than astaxanthin such as zeaxanthin and β-cryptoxanthin as a major xanthophyll carotenoid in the recombinant microorganism belonging to the genus Phaffia.<br>
Any strain which is able to produce β-carotene can be a suitable host strain. When the selected host strain is a normal Phaffia strain which is capable of producing astaxanthin from (3-carotene, production of mixture of astaxanthin and other xanthophyll carotenoids<br>
can be achieved after introduction and expression of a gene coding for β-carotene hydroxylase. On the other hand, when a strain which can not produce astaxanthin and is<br>
accumulating β-carotene is selected as the host strain, it is expected to produce maximum<br>
level of xanthophyll carotenoids such as zeaxanthin and β-cryptoxanthin, without accu-<br>
mulation of astaxanthin. Such a host strain which accumulates β-carotene can be obtained by mutagenesis of a strain of P. rhodozyma accumulating astaxanthin. Alternatively, such a host strain accumulating β-carotene can also be obtained by deactivating astaxanthin synthase which is an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of<br><br>
astaxanthin from β-carotene and is disclosed in US 6,365,386. Disruption of the gene of astaxanthin synthase will be one of the most convenient ways to deactivate the enzyme.<br>
Furthermore, such a host strain accumulating β-carotene can also be obtained from public type culture collections. E.g., P. rhodozyma ATCC96815 accumulating β-carotene can be purchased from American Type Culture Collection (P.O.Box 1549, Manassas, VA 20108, USA). Isolating a new β-carotene accumulating strain of P. rhodozyma, which may be a derivative or a spontaneous mutant of astaxanthin producing strain, from nature will be another approach to prepare the host strain of the present invention.<br>
An aspect of the present invention is a process for producing zeaxanthin and β-crypto-xanthin which comprises cultivating a recombinant Phaffia strain which is expressing<br>
β-carotene hydroxylase.<br>
Said β-carotene hydroxylase catalyzes hydroxylation of β-carotene at positions 3 and 3' on<br>
the β-ionone ring to produce the xanthophyll, zeaxanthin via β-cryptoxanthin. Genes encoding this enzyme have been isolated from several species, e.g., crtZ from Flavobacterium species (US 6,124,113), crtZ from Erwinia uredovora, crtZ from Erwinia herbicola, crtZs from marine bacteria, Agrobacteriurri aiirantiacum and Alcaligenes sp., and Paracoccus marcusii (GenBank accession No. Y15112, 1997), and Paracoccus carotinifaciens sp.nov.<br>
β-carotene hydrox7lase genes can also be obtained from plant species.<br>
In the present invention, any gene encoding a protein having the β-carotene hydroxylase activity can be used.<br>
Preferably, said β-carotene hydroxylase gene can be obtained from a microorganism selected from microorganisms of the genera Flavobacterium, Erwinia, Agrobacteriurriy<br>
Alcaligenes, and Paracoccus having the β-carotene hydroxylase gene.<br>
More preferably, said β-carotene hydroxylase gene can be obtained from Flavobacterium sp. R1534 WT (ATCC21588) (GenBank accession No. U62808), £ uredovora ATCC1932I (GenBank accession No. D90087), E. herbicola ATCC39368 (GenBank accession No. M87280), Agrobacterium aurantiacurn (GenBank accession No. D58420), Alcaligenes PC-1 (GenBank accession No. D58422), Paracoccus marcusii MHl (GenBank accession No. Y15112), or the gram-negative bacteria E-396 (PERM Bβ-4283) (Jβ-A Hei 10-155497)<br>
having the β-carotene hydroxylase gene.<br><br>
Still more preferably, said 3-carotene hydroxylase gene can be obtained from Flavobncteri-urn sp. R1534 WT (ATCC21588) (GenBank accession No. U62808), or it can also be obtained as a DNA sequence which is substantially homologous thereto.<br>
The expression "a DNA sequence which is substantially homologous" refers with respect to the DNA sequence encoding the β-carotene hydroxylase to a DNA sequence which encodes an amino acid sequence which shows more than 60%, preferably more than 70%, more preferably more than 80%, and most preferably more than 90% identical amino acids when compared to the amino acid sequence of crtZ of Flavobacterium sp. R1534 WT (ATCC21588) and is the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide which shows the same type of enzymatic activity as the enzyme encoded by crtZ of Flavobacterium sp, R1534 WT(ATCC21588).<br>
By using the |3-carotene hydroxylase gene, it is possible to render a microorganism belonging to the genus PbaJJia an ability to produce zeaxanthin and |3-cryptoxanthin. The recombinant microorganism ofPhaffia expressing a β-carotene hydroxylase gene can be prepared by the well-known recombinant technology.<br>
The techniques used to isolate or clone a DNA encoding β-carotene hydroxylase of the present invention are known in the art and include isolation from genomic DNA. The cloning of the DNA sequence of the present invention from such genomic DNA can be effected by using the polymerase chain reaction (hereinafter referred to as PCR).<br>
The isolated or cloned DNA encoding [3-carotene hydroxylase can be preferably utilized after cloning on a suitable expression vector for expression of the enzyme in the host microorganism Phajfia.<br>
"Expression vector" includes vectors which are capable of expressing DNA sequences contained therein where such sequences are operably linked to other sequences such as control sequences which are capable of effecting the expression of said DNA sequences in a microorganism belonging to Phaffia. The term "operably linked" refers to a juxtaposition wherein the components so described are in a relationship permitting them to function in their intended manner. The term "control sequence" is intended to include, ara minimum, components which are necessary for expression of the gene of interest, and may also include additional advantageous components. Generally the control sequences include promoters, terminators and, in some instances, enhancers, transactivators, or transcription factors. Constitutive promoters, such as the glyceraldehyde-3-dehydrogenase (GAP) gene<br><br>
promoter derived from P. rhodozyma (WO 97/23,633), may be used to obtain constitutive expression. Inducible promoters can be also used in order to achieve an exactly-controlled expression. One of the examples for the inducible promoters is the promoter of genes encoding heat shock proteins or amylase gene, and the like.<br>
Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art may be used to construct said expression vectors.<br>
It is implied, although not explicitly stated, that expression vectors must be replicable in the host organisms either as episomes or as an integral part of a chromosomal DNA. Generally, higher stability of the gene may be expected in the latter case. To integrate the expression vector into the chromosome of the host microorganism by a homologous recombination, a vector is prepared to contain at least a portion of the DNA fragment whose sequence is homologous to the host genomic DNA. For this purpose, rDNA gene fragment can be effectively used in a microorganism belonging to Phaffia, The rDNA is a kind of satellite DNAs which exist in multicopies on the genome. By using the rDNA fragment as a targeting DNA on the expression vector, the objective DNA to be expressed on said vector can be integrated into the host genome, and also can exist as multicopies. This may give the gene dosage effects which will contribute to the overexpression of the objective enzymes. In the Examples of the present invention, such rDNA fragment was conveniently used for this purpose. The invention is intended to include other forms of expression vectors which serve equivalent functions and which are, or subsequently become, known.<br>
An isolated DNA sequence encoding β-carotene hydroxylase may be manipulated in a variety of ways to provide for expression of the polypeptide. Manipulation of the nucleotide sequence encoding said (3-carotene hydroxylase prior to its insertion into an expression vector may be desirable or necessary depending on the expression vector. The techniques for modifying nucleotide sequences utilizing cloning methods are well known in the art.<br>
Recombinant DNA consisting of said gene of (3-carotene hydroxylase which was cloned in the expression vector will be introduced into a host microorganism. Methods for the introduction of foreign DNA intojungal cells including a microorganism belonging to PHaffta are well known in the art. These include, e.g., transformation by the LiCl method, protoplast fusion, electroporation, particle-gun methods which comprises bombardment by particles coated with DNAs, and other methods known in the art. In the Examples of the present invention, the particle-gun method was applied as a transformation method for P. rhodozyma.<br><br>
The recombinant organism thus obtained is capable of overexpressing the DNA sequence encoding β-carocene hydroxylase. Thus, the recombinant organism of the present invention is useful in the production process of xanthophyll carotenoids, especially zeaxanthin<br>
and β-cryptoxnnthin.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention is a biological process for producing zeaxanthin and β-cryptoxanthin which comprises cultivating the recombinant microorganism of Phaffia in the presence of substrate for producing carotenoids in an aqueous nutrient medium under aerobic conditions, and isolating the resulting carotenoids from the cells of said recombinant microorganism or from the cultured broth.<br>
Carotenoids including the xanthophylls are normally produced by cultivating a strain of Phaffia in a medium which comprises suitable macro- and micronutrients for the cells, such as molasses, saccharose or glucose as a carbohydrate source for cell growth and also as a substrate for producing carotenoids, and nitrogen sources such as corn steep liquor, yeast extract, diammonium sulphate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium hydroxide or urea, phosphorus sources such as ammonium phosphate and phosphoric acid and added micronutrients or mineral salts such as magnesium sulphate, zinc sulphate and biotin or desthiobiotin.<br>
The preferable conditions for cultivation are in a pH range of from 4 to 8 and in a temperature range of from 15 to 26°C for 24 to 500 hours.<br>
More preferable conditions for cultivation are a pH in the range of from 5 to 7 and in a temperature range of from 18 to 22oC for 48 to 350 hours.<br>
In the cultivation, aeration and agitation usually give favorable results for the production of carotenoids.<br>
Once carotenoids were produced by cultivating the recombinant strain of Phaffia using the methods of the present invention, the carotenoids can be isolated either from the medium, in the case they are secreted into the medium, or from the cells of the microorganism and, if necessary, separated from other carotenoids that may be present in case one specific carotenoid is desired, by methods known in the art.<br>
Carotenoids produced in accordance with the present invention can be used in a process for the preparation of food or feed. A man skilled in the art is familiar with such processes. Such compound food or feed can further comprise additives or components generally used for such purpose and known in the state of the art.<br><br>

Overnight culture (50 ml) was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min. The pellet was washed briefly with 10 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM EDTA, O.lM<br><br>
NaCl, pH 7.5), resuspended in 4 ml of the same buffer supplemented with 10 mg of lyso-zyme and incubated at 37°C for 15 min. After addition of 0.3 ml of N-Lauroyl sarcosine (20%), incubation at 37°C was continued for another 15 min before extraction of DNA with phenol, phenol/chloroform and chloroform. The DNA was ethanol precipitated at room temperature for 20 min in the presence of 0.3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2), followed by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 15 min.
