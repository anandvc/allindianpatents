FLUORESCENT BRIGHTENER COMPOSITIONS, AND METHODS OF<br>
PREPARATION AND USES THEREOF<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] This disclosure relates to fluorescent brighteners. More particularly the disclosure relates to fluorescent brighteners, methods of preparing the fluorescent brighteners, compositions comprising the fluorescent brighteners, in particular polymer compositions comprising the fluorescent brighteners, and uses thereof.<br>
[0002] Fluorescent brighteners, also known as fluorescent whitening agents, fluorescent whiteners, optical brighteners, and optical whiteners, are additives that alter the visual properties of polymers. Fluorescent brighteners are colorless to weakly colored organic compounds. When in solution, applied to a substrate, or combined with a polymer, they absorb primarily ultraviolet light in the 300 to 400 nanometer (nm) range. Most of the absorbed energy is then re-emitted as visible violet-to-blue fluorescent light in the 400 to 500 nm range. Fluorescent brighteners thus help to mask inherent yellowness in discolored polymers and impart unique, robust color to specialty plastic products.<br>
[0003] There are very few fluorescent brighteners exhibiting high Tg values. In addition, many fluorescent brighteners decompose at temperatures commonly used to process polymers. One high Tg fluorescent brightener is 2,2'-(2,5-thiophenediyl) bis[5-(l,l-dimethylethyl)]-benzoxazole, (CAS No. [7128-64-5]) available from Ciba under the trade name UVITEX®-OB. Nonetheless, there remains a need in the art for fluorescent brighteners that have a high Tg to enable their use in a wide variety of polymers, especially thermoplastic polymers.<br>

[0007] The above-described and other features are exemplified by the following detailed description.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0008] Disclosed herein are compounds having high Tg and that in some embodiments may be used as fluorescent brighteners.<br>
[0009] The singular forms "a", "an" and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. All ranges disclosed herein are inclusive of the endpoint and independently combinable (for example ranges of "up to 25 weight (wt.) percent, with 5 wt. percent to 20 wt. percent desired,'* is inclusive of the endpoints and all intermediate values of the ranges of "5 wt. percent to 25 wt. percent").<br>
[0010] The modifier "about" used in connection with a quantity is inclusive of the stated value and has the meaning dictated by the context (for example, includes the degree of error associated with measurement of the particular quantity).<br>
[001 1] "BPA" is herein defined as bisphenol A, and is also known as 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane, 4,4'-isopropylidenediphenol, and p,p-BPA.<br>
[0012] Unless otherwise specified, the term "cycloaliphatic functionality"' designates cyclic aliphatic functionalities having a valence of at least one, and comprising an array of atoms which is cyclic but which is not aromatic. The cycloaliphatic   functionality   may   include   heteroatoms   such   as   nitrogen,   sulfur,<br>
selenium, silicon, and oxygen, or may be composed exclusively of carbon and hydrogen. A "cycloaliphatic functionality" may be linked via the cyclic group or via another group on the cyclic group. For example, a cyclohexylmethyl group (C6H11CH2-) is a cycloaliphatic functionality that comprises a cyclohexyl ring (the array of atoms which is cyclic but which is not aromatic) and a methylene group (the noncyclic component). A "cycloaliphatic moiety" may further be unsubstituted or substituted, i.e., comprising one or more noncyclic components, including functional groups such as alkyl groups, alkenyl groups, alkynyl groups, haloalkyl groups, halogen(s), conjugated dienyl groups, alcohol groups, ether groups, carboxylic acid groups, acyl groups (for example carboxylic acid derivatives such as esters and amides), amine groups and nitro groups, provided that the functional group(s) do not substantially adversely impact the intended function of the compound. For example, the 4-methylcyclopent-l-yl group is a C6 cycloaliphatic functionality comprising a methyl group, wherein the methyl group is an alkyl functional group. Similarly, the 2-nitrocyclobut-l-yl group is a C4 cycloaliphatic functionality comprising a nitro group, wherein the nitro group is a functional group. Exemplary cycloaliphatic functionalities include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, 1,1,4,4-tetramethylcyclobutyl, piperidinyl, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyl, cyclohexyl, and cyclopentyl.<br>
[0013] As used herein, the term "aromatic functionality" refers to an array of atoms having a valence of at least one, and comprising at least one aromatic group. The array of atoms comprising the at least one aromatic group may include heteroatoms such as nitrogen, sulfur, selenium, silicon, and oxygen, or may be composed exclusively of carbon and hydrogen. As used herein, the term "aromatic functionality" includes but is not limited to phenyl, pyridyl, furanyl, thienyl, naphthyl, phenylene, and biphenyl functionalities. The aromatic functionality may also include nonaromatic components. For example, a benzyl group is an aromatic functionality that comprises a phenyl ring (the aromatic group) and a methylene group (the nonaromatic component). Similarly a tetrahydronaphthyl functionality is an aromatic functionality comprising an aromatic group (C6H3) fused to a nonaromatic component -(CH2)4-. An "aromatic functionality" may further be unsubstituted or substituted with a wide range of functional groups such as alkyl groups, haloalkyl groups,<br>
haloaromatic groups, halogens, alcohol groups, ether groups, carboxylic acid groups, acyl groups (for example carboxylic acid derivatives such as esters and amides), amine groups and nitro groups, provided that the functional group(s) do not substantially adversely impact the intended function of the compound. For example, the 4-methylphenyl functionality is a C7 aromatic functionality comprising a methyl group, wherein the methyl group is an alkyl functional group. Similarly, the 2-nitrophenyl group is a C6 aromatic functionality comprising a nitro group, wherein the nitro group is a functional group. Exemplary aromatic functionalities include, but are not limited to phenyl, 4-trifluoromethylphenyl, 4-chloromethylphen-l-yl, 3-trichloromethylphen-1-yl (3-CCl3Ph-), 4-(3-bromoprop-l-yl)phen-l-yl (4-BrCH2CH2CH2Ph-), 4-aminophen-l-yl (4-H2NPh-), 4-hydroxymethylphen-1-yl (4-HOCH2Ph-), 4-methylthiophen-l-yl (4-CH3SPh-), 3-methoxyphen-l-yl, 2-nitromethylphen-1-yl (2-N02CH2Ph-), and naphthyl.<br>
[0014] As used herein the term "aliphatic functionality" refers to an organic functionality having at least one carbon, a valence of at least one, and consisting of a linear or branched array of atoms that is not cyclic. The array of atoms comprising the aliphatic functionality may include heteroatoms such as nitrogen, sulfur, silicon, selenium, and oxygen or may be composed exclusively of carbon and hydrogen. An "aliphatic functionality" may be unsubstituted or substituted with a wide range of functional groups such as alkyl groups, haloalkyl groups, halogens, alcohol groups, ether groups, carboxylic acid groups, acyl groups (for example carboxylic acid derivatives such as esters and amides), amine groups, and nitro groups, provided that the functional group(s) do not substantially adversely impact the intended function of the compound. For example, the 4-methylpent-l-yl is a C6 aliphatic functionality comprising a methyl group, wherein the methyl group is a functional group which is an alkyl group. Similarly, the 4-nitrobut-l-yl group is a C4 aliphatic functionality comprising a nitro group, wherein the nitro group is a functional group. Exemplary aliphatic functionalities include, but are not limited to methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, pentyl, isopentyl, trifluoromethyl, bromodifluoromethyl, chlorodifluoromethyl, chloromethyl, trichloromethyl, bromoethyl, 2-hexyl, hexamethylene, hydroxymethyl (-CH2OH), mercaptomethyl (-CH2SH), methylthio (-<br>
SCH3), methylthiomethyl (-CH2SCH3), methoxy, methoxycarbonyl (CH3OCO-) , nitromethyl (-CH2NO2) and thiocarbonyl.<br>

wherein R9, R10, and Ru are independently at each occurrence hydrogen, a halogen, a cyano functionality, a C1-C20 aliphatic functionality, a C3-C10 cycloaliphatic functionality or a C3-C20 aromatic functionality; R4 and R5 are independently at each occurrence hydrogen, a halogen, a cyano functionality, a C1-C20 aliphatic functionality, a C3-C10 cycloaliphatic functionality or a C3-C10 aromatic functionality; R7 and R8 are independently at each occurrence, a halogen, a cyano functionality, a C1-C20 aliphatic functionality, a C3-C10 cycloaliphatic functionality or a C3-C10 aromatic functionality; R6 is a C2-C20 aliphatic functionality, a C3-C10 cycloaliphatic functionality or a C3-C20 aromatic functionality, "n" and "m" are each independently integers having a value of 1 to 3 and a polymer.<br>
[0033] In one embodiment, R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5 are independently at each occurrence hydrogen or a C2-C6 aliphatic functionality, R7 and R8 are independently at each occurrence a halogen, a cyano functionality, or a C1-C6 aliphatic functionality, and n and m are each 0 to 3.<br>
[0034] The compounds may be prepared in a similar manner as described for the preparation of the compound of Formula (I).<br>
[0035] The compounds of Formulas (I) and (VIII) can have utility as fluorescent brighteners. In one embodiment, a compound that can be used as a fluorescent brightener has an absorption maximum in the 300 to 400 nm range, and an emission maximum in the 400 to 500 nm range, measured in an appropriate solvent, such as dichloromethane. Fluorescent brighteners find utility as an additive to a wide range of materials, including textiles, paper, detergents, and polymers. For example fluorescent brighteners can be used to impart a "whiter-than-white" appearance to polymers pigmented with titanium dioxide; to produce a bluish tinge in clear<br>
polymers, masking yellowness; to make  lightly colored polymers appear more brilliant; and/or to aid in restoring whiteness to recycled polymers.<br>
[0036] One or more of the foregoing effects can be observed with the naked eye, or measured using a tristimulus reflection colorimeter, using the CIELAB color scale, L*, a*, and b*, where L* defines lightness, the a* axis denotes green/red (+/-) and the b* axis defines blue/yellow (+/-). Higher L* values indicate that more light is reflected. Addition of fluorescent brighteners can result in lower b* values. The blue color range occupies the negative (-) side of the b* axis, while the yellow color range occupies the positive side. The lower the b* value, the less yellow color is perceived by the naked eye, and likewise, lower b* values indicate greater perception of whiteness and blue color. Accordingly, when used as fluorescent brighteners, the compounds of Formula (I) decrease the b* value of the composition containing a compound of Formulas (I) relative to the same composition without the compound of Formula (I). In one embodiment the b* value of the composition containing the compound of Formula (I) is decreased by at least 5% of the b* value of the same composition without the compound of Formula (I). Similarly, when used as fluorescent brighteners, the compounds of Formula (VIII) decrease the b* value of the composition containing a compound of Formulas (VIII) relative to the same composition without the compound of Formula (VIII). In one embodiment the b* value of the composition containing the compound of Formula (VIII) is decreased by at least 5% of the b* value of the same composition without the compound of Formula (VIII).<br>
[0037] Both of the compounds of Formula (I) and (VIII) (singly or in combination) can be used in the brightening of polymers, especially thermoplastic polymers, for example, polycarbonates, polyesters, polyimides, polyamides, polyetherimides, thermoplastic polyurethanes, epoxide containing polymers, polyvinylchlorides, and others. It is also possible to use combinations comprising one or more of foregoing polymers, for example combinations of polycarbonates and/or polycarbonate copolymers with polyamides, polyesters, other polycarbonates; copolyester-polycarbonates, olefin polymers such as acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), polystyrene, polyethylene; polysiloxanes, polysilanes and/or polysulfones.

Company),   pentaerythritol   tetrastearate,   Metablen®   A-3000   (available   from Mitsubishi Rayon) and neopentyl glycol dibenzoate.<br>
[0054] Radiation stabilizers may also be present in the thermoplastic composition, specifically gamma-radiation stabilizers. Suitable gamma-radiation stabilizers include diols, such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,2-butanediol, 1,4-butanediol, meso-2,3-butanediol, 1,2-pentanediol, 2,3-pentanediol, 1,4-pentanediol and 1,4-hexandiol.; alicyclic alcohols such as 1,2-cyclopentanediol and 1,2-cyclohexanediol; branched acyclic diols such as 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-butanediol (pinacol), and polyols, as well as alkoxy-substituted cyclic or acyclic alkanes. Alkenols with sites of unsaturation are also a useful class of alcohols, examples of which include 4-methyl-4-penten-2-ol, 3-methyl-pentene-3-ol, 2-methyl-4-penten-2-ol, 2,4-dimethyl-4-penten-2-ol, and 9-decen-l-ol.

Examples of these include 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (hexylene glycol), 2-phenyl-2-butanol, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-butanone and cycloaliphatic tertiary carbons such as 1 -hydroxy- 1-methyl-cyclohexane. Another class of suitable alcohols is hydroxymethyl aromatics, which have hydroxy substitution on a saturated carbon attached to an unsaturated carbon in an aromatic ring. The hydroxy substituted saturated carbon may be a methylol group (-CH2OH) or it may be a member of a more complex hydrocarbon group such as would be the case with (-CR7HOH) or (-CR2 7OH) wherein R7 is a complex or a simply hydrocarbon. Specific hydroxy methyl aromatics may be benzhydrol, 1,3-benzenedimethanol, benzyl alcohol, 4-benzyloxy benzyl alcohol and benzyl benzyl alcohol.

[0056] Anti-drip agents may also be used, for example a fibril forming or non-fibril forming fluoropolymer such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The anti-drip agent may be encapsulated by a rigid copolymer as described above, for example styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer (SAN). PTFE encapsulated in SAN is known as TSAN. Encapsulated fluoropolymers may be made by polymerizing the encapsulating polymer in the presence of the fluoropolymer, for example an aqueous dispersion. TSAN may provide significant advantages over PTFE, in that TSAN may be more readily dispersed in the composition. A suitable TSAN may comprise, for example, about 50 wt. percent PTFE and about 50 wt. percent SAN, based on the total weight of the encapsulated fluoropolymer. The SAN may comprise, for example, about 75 wt. percent styrene and about 25 wt. percent acrylonitrile based on the total weight of the copolymer. Alternatively, the fluoropolymer may be pre-blended in some manner with a second polymer, such as for, example, an aromatic polycarbonate resin or SAN to form an agglomerated material for use as an anti-drip agent. Either method may be used to produce an encapsulated fluoropolymer.<br>
[0057] The thermoplastic polymer compositions may be manufactured by methods generally available in the art, for example, in one embodiment, powdered polymer resin and/or other optional components are first blended, for example in a Henschel™ high speed mixer. Other low shear processes including but not limited to hand mixing may also accomplish this blending. The blend is then fed into the throat of a twin-screw extruder via a hopper. Alternatively, one or more of the components may be incorporated into the composition by feeding directly into the extruder at the throat and/or downstream through a sidestuffer. Such additives may also be compounded into a masterbatch with a desired polymeric resin and fed into the extruder. The extruder is generally operated at a temperature higher than that necessary to cause the composition to flow. The extrudate is immediately quenched in a water batch and pelletized. The pellets may be one-fourth inch long (6.35 millimeter) or less as desired. Such pellets may be used for subsequent molding, shaping, or forming.<br>
[0058] Shaped, formed, or molded articles comprising the polymer compositions are also provided. The polymer compositions may be molded into useful shaped articles by a variety of means such as injection molding, extrusion, rotational molding, blow molding and thermoforming to form articles such as, for example, computer and business machine housings such as housings for monitors, handheld electronic device housings such as housings for cell phones, electrical connectors, and components of lighting fixtures, ornaments, home appliances, roofs, greenhouses, sun rooms, swimming pool enclosures and automotive applications, for example forward lighting enclosures for car headlamps).<br>
