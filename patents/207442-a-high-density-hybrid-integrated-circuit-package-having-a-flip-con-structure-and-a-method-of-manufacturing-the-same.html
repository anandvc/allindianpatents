The invention relates to a high density hybrid integrated circuit package having a flip con structure and a method of uanufaoturing the same<br>
If'lip fton est rue tare is a novel chip integration technique which provides about 90% increase in packaging densities in a hybrid integrated circuit.<br>
With small satellite missions becoming a reality and preliminary studies undergoing, it was felt that new packaging technologies which could provide higher functional integration in small volumes shall be pursued. So far users are provided with single layer and multilayer hybrid circuits using conventional chip and wire technology. Though some developmental work has been carried out in areas of multilayer structures and photo etchable high density interconnections for increasing interconnect densities» it did not provide major improvements. In a conventional hybrid integrated circuit, interconnections are carried out by wire bonding. In a flip chip assembly of hybrid integrated circuit, the chip is reversed and directly attached to a substrate in face down configuration. The interconnections between bond pads of chip and metalised conductor are provided through metallic bumps formed on the chip.<br>
The high density hybrid integrated circuit package according to the invention provides a three dimensional packaging by mounting two chips on over the other on a substrate.<br><br>
i<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a high density hybrid integrated circuit package comprising an insulator substrate with a metaiised pattern for interconnecting the integrated circuit configuration an integrated circuit flip chip consisting of plurality of semiconductor devices and provided with gold stud bumps for providing inter-connect ions by thermal compression bonding&gt; the said gold stud bumps on the flip clip being bonded to the metaiised portions on the ceramic substrate, an integrated circuit top chip consisting of plurality of semiconductor devices being fixed with an epoxy to the top portion of the flip chip and the electrical connections from the top chip to the metaiised pattern on the substrate being taken through goidwires bonded to the top chip and the metaiised pattern on the substrate.<br>
The invention also provides a method of manufacturing a high density hybrid integrated circuit package as described hereinabove, comprising the steps of preparing art insu later substrate with a metaiised pattern to form the desired integrated circuit configuration, preparing an integrated circuit flip chip and an integrated circuit top chip consisting of plurality of semiconductor  devices, making gold stud bumps on the flip  chip„<br><br>
at \ aching, the V t ip ^bip by thermal compression bonding between the gold stud bumps on the flip chip and the corresponding connection points on the top chip to the respective connection points in the metalised pattern on the substrate, f ixing the top **-hip on top of the flip chip by means of an epoxy adhesive, bondiug go Id wire to the connect i on points on the top ohip to the respective connect ion points in the metalised pattern on the substrate to obtain the hybrid integrated circuit package<br>
f'rfiter ably 1:he space between the f 1 ip chip and the insulater substrate is fi 1 led with an epoxy and cured for a stab1e attachment between the flip chip and the substrate. The insulator substrate is preferably a ceramic substrate, Thus in * be hybrid integrated circuit package according to the invention, the integrated circuit in the flip chip and the integrated n i rcu it in the top chip are mounted back to back. The connections from the integrated circuit in th flip chip is provided by chip bonding and the connections from the integrated circuit in the top chip is provided by wire bonding.<br>
t n order to make the interconnection between the flip chip and the substrate the chip is tempererily glued to a substrate with an adhesive. Then using gold wire and thermosonic wire bonder, the gold stud bumps are formed on the chip at the point of connections. Typically, the gold wire used is of about 1.0 mil diameter, 1 to 3% elongation and tensil strength of about  12<br><br>
gms The gold stud bumps are made preferably keeping the temperature of the substrate at 12b to 150°C, bonding force i«at.v?een 40 to 100 gms and the bonding time between 40 to 80 millisecond The chip is removed from the substrate after the £oid stud bumps are formed on the chip, The f 3 ip chip with gold stud bumps are aligned with the metalised pattern on the subsirate which is heated preferably at a temperature of 240 to i!60°*t mi*:\ bonded to the respective connection points in the metalised pattern on the substrate by thermal compression bonding. The bonded chip is tested for interconnection integrity<br>
The method of chip bonding and wire bonding are well known in the art and the optimum parameters to obtain good result are well known tor person skilled in the art. Various thermal compression bonding machines and thermosonic wire bonders are used in the art.<br>
After the flip chip is bonded to the substrate» an epoxy is dispensed from the side to fill the space between the flip chip and the substrate. It is preferable to use a two part epoxy with a viscosity typically in the range of 1800 to 2000 ops, so that, the space between the flip chip and substrate is filled by capillary action. It is then cured at a temperature preferably in the range of 80 to 150°C for a period of 30 to 120 minutes in an oven The top chip is attached with non-conductive epoxy adhesive to the flip chip and cured preferably at a temperature in i be range of 80 to 150°C for 30 to 120 minutes in an oven.<br><br>
Interconnections from top chip to the metalised pattern on the substrate is done by thermogenic wire bonding using gold wire Typically 1.0 mil diameter gold wire having an elongation of i to 3%, tensile strength of 12 gms is used for wire bonding » Preferably substrate .temperature may be kept at 125 to 150°C, t»««n<i ing force may be kept at to gms and bonding period between milii second the wire is vndfciy used in art parameters are well known persons ski ed a.ri .></i>
In order tn protect the wire bonding from mechanical stress the structure is preferably encapsulated using a known glob top enoapsulant. it provides additional heat desipation to the package<br>
