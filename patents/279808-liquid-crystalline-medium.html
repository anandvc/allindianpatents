				<td>Liquid-crystalline medium<br>
The present invention relates to a liquid-crystalline medium (LC medium),<br>
to the use thereof for electro-optical purposes, and to LC displays con-<br>
taining this medium.<br>
Liquid crystals are used principally as dielectrics in display devices, since<br>
the optical properties of such substances can be modified by an applied<br>
voltage. Electro-optical devices based on liquid crystals are extremely well<br>
known to the person skilled in the art and can be based on various effects.<br>
Examples of such devices are cells having dynamic scattering, DAP<br>
(deformation of aligned phases) cells, guest/host cells, TN cells having a<br>
twisted nematic structure, STN (supertwisted nematic) cells, SBE (super-<br>
birefringence effect) cells and OMI (optical mode interference) cells. The<br>
commonest display devices are based on the Schadt-Helfrich effect and<br>
have a twisted nematic structure. In addition, there are also cells which<br>
work with an electric field parallel to the substrate and liquid-crystal plane,<br>
such as, for example, IPS ("in-plane switching") cells. TN, STN, FFS<br>
(fringe field switching) and IPS cells, in particular, are currently commer-<br>
cially interesting areas of application for the media according to the inven-<br>
tion.<br>
The liquid-crystal materials must have good chemical and thermal stability<br>
and good stability to electric fields and electromagnetic radiation. Further-<br>
more, the liquid-crystal materials should have low viscosity and produce<br>
short addressing times, low threshold voltages and high contrast in the<br>
cells.<br>
They should furthermore have a suitable mesophase, for example a<br>
nematic or cholesteric mesophase for the above-mentioned cells, at the<br>
usual operating temperatures, i.e. in the broadest possible range above<br>
and below room temperature. Since liquid crystals are generally used as<br>
mixtures of a plurality of components, it is important that the components<br>
are readily miscible with one another. Further properties, such as the elec-<br>
trical conductivity, the dielectric anisotropy and the optical anisotropy, have<br>
to satisfy various requirements depending on the cell type and area of<br>
 <br>
application. For example, materials for cells having a twisted nematic<br>
structure should have positive dielectric anisotropy and low electrical con-<br>
ductivity.<br>
For example, for matrix liquid-crystal displays with integrated non-linear<br>
elements for switching individual pixels (MLC displays), media having large<br>
positive dielectric anisotropy, broad nematic phases, relatively low birefrin-<br>
gence, very high specific resistance, good UV and temperature stability<br>
and low vapour pressure are desired.<br>
Matrix liquid-crystal displays of this type are known. Examples of non-linear<br>
elements which can be used to individually switch the individual pixels are<br>
active elements (i.e. transistors). The term "active matrix" is then used,<br>
where a distinction can be made between two types:<br>
1.	MOS (metal oxide semiconductor) or other diodes on silicon wafers<br>
as substrate.<br>
2.	Thin-film transistors (TFTs) on a glass plate as substrate.<br>
The use of single-crystal silicon as substrate material restricts the display<br>
size, since even modular assembly of various part-displays results in<br>
problems at the joints.<br>
In the case of the more promising type 2, which is preferred, the electro-<br>
optical effect used is usually the TN effect. A distinction is made between<br>
two technologies: TFTs comprising compound semiconductors, such as,<br>
for example, CdSe, or TFTs based on polycrystalline or amorphous silicon.<br>
Intensive work is being carried out worldwide on the latter technology.<br>
The TFT matrix is applied to the inside of one glass plate of the display,<br>
while the other glass plate carries the transparent counterelectrode on its<br>
inside. Compared with the size of the pixel electrode, the TFT is very small<br>
and has virtually no adverse effect on the image. This technology can also<br>
be extended to fully colour-capable displays, in which a mosaic of red,<br>
 <br>
green and blue filters is arranged in such a way that a filter element is<br>
opposite each switchable pixel.<br>
The TFT displays usually operate as TN cells with crossed polarisers in<br>
transmission and are backlit.<br>
The term MLC displays here encompasses any matrix display with integ-<br>
rated non-linear elements, i.e., besides the active matrix, also displays with<br>
passive elements, such as varistors or diodes (MIM = metal-insulator-<br>
metal).<br>
MLC displays of this type are particularly suitable for TV applications (for<br>
example pocket televisions) or for high-information displays for computer<br>
applications (laptops) and in automobile or aircraft construction. Besides<br>
problems regarding the angle dependence of the contrast and the re-<br>
sponse times, difficulties also arise in MLC displays due to insufficiently<br>
high specific resistance of the liquid-crystal mixtures [TOGASHI, S., SEKI-<br>
GUCHI, K., TANABE, H., YAMAMOTO, E., SORIMACHI, K., TAJIMA, E.,<br>
WATANABE, H., SHIMIZU, H., Proc. Eurodisplay 84, Sept. 1984:<br>
A 21O-288 Matrix LCD Controlled by Double Stage Diodoe Rings, p. 141 ff,<br>
Paris; STROMER, M., Proc. Eurodisplay 84, Sept. 1984: Design of Thin<br>
Film Transistors for Matrix Addressing of Television Liquid Crystal Dis-<br>
plays, p. 145 ff, Paris]. With decreasing resistance, the contrast of an MLC<br>
display deteriorates, and the problem of after-image elimination may occur.<br>
Since the specific resistance of the liquid-crystal mixture generally drops<br>
over the life of an MLC display owing to interaction with the interior sur-<br>
faces of the display, a high (initial) resistance is very important in order to<br>
obtain acceptable lifetimes. In particular in the case of low-volt mixtures, it<br>
was hitherto impossible to achieve very high specific resistance values. It<br>
is furthermore important that the specific resistance exhibits the smallest<br>
possible increase with increasing temperature and after heating and/or UV<br>
exposure. The low-temperature properties of the mixtures from the prior art<br>
are also particularly disadvantageous. It is demanded that no crystallisa-<br>
tion and/or smectic phases occur, even at low temperatures, and the tem-<br>
perature dependence of the viscosity is as low as possible. The MLC dis-<br>
plays from the prior art thus do not satisfy today's requirements.<br>
 <br>
Besides liquid-crystal displays which use backlighting, i.e. are operated<br>
transmissively and if desired transflectively, reflective liquid-crystal displays<br>
are also particularly interesting. These reflective liquid-crystal displays use<br>
the ambient light for information display. They thus consume significantly<br>
less energy than backlit liquid-crystal displays having a corresponding size<br>
and resolution. Since the TN effect is characterised by very good contrast,<br>
reflective displays of this type can even be read well in bright ambient con-<br>
ditions. This is already known of simple reflective TN displays, as used, for<br>
example, in watches and pocket calculators. However, the principle can<br>
also be applied to high-quality, higher-resolution active matrix-addressed<br>
displays, such as, for example, TFT displays. Here, as already in the trans-<br>
missive TFT-TN displays which are generally conventional, the use of<br>
liquid crystals of low birefringence (An) is necessary in order to achieve low<br>
optical retardation (d • An). This low optical retardation results in usually<br>
acceptably low viewing-angle dependence of the contrast (cf. DE<br>
30 22 818). In reflective displays, the use of liquid crystals of low birefrin-<br>
gence is even more important than in transmissive displays since the<br>
effective layer thickness through which the light passes is approximately<br>
twice as large in reflective displays as in transmissive displays having the<br>
same layer thickness.<br>
For TV and video applications, displays having short response times are<br>
required. Such short response times can be achieved, in particular, if<br>
liquid-crystal media having low values for the viscosity, in particular the<br>
rotational viscosity γ1, are used. However, diluting additives generally lower<br>
the clearing point and thus reduce the working-temperature range of the<br>
medium.<br>
Thus, there continues to be a great demand for MLC displays having very<br>
high specific resistance at the same time as a large working-temperature<br>
range, short response times, even at low temperatures, and a low thresh-<br>
old voltage which do not exhibit these disadvantages or only do so to a<br>
lesser extent.<br>
 <br>
In the case of TN (Schadt-Helfrich) cells, media are desired which facilitate<br>
the following advantages in the cells:<br>
extended nematic phase range (in particular down to low tempera-<br>
tures)<br>
switchability at extremely low temperatures (outdoor use, auto-<br>
mobiles, avionics)<br>
increased resistance to UV radiation (longer life)<br>
low threshold voltage.<br>
The media available from the prior art do not enable these advantages to<br>
be achieved while simultaneously retaining the other parameters.<br>
In the case of supertwisted (STN) cells, media are desired which facilitate<br>
greater multiplexability and/or lower threshold voltages and/or broader<br>
nematic phase ranges (in particular at low temperatures). To this end, a<br>
further widening of the available parameter latitude (clearing point,<br>
smectic-nematic transition or melting point, viscosity, dielectric parameters,<br>
elastic parameters) is urgently desired.<br>
In particular in the case of LC displays for TV and video applications (for<br>
example LCD TVs, monitors, PDAs, notebooks, games consoles), a sig-<br>
nificant reduction in the response times is desired. A reduction in the layer<br>
thickness d ("cellap") of the LC medium in the LC cell theoretically results<br>
in faster response times, but requires LC media having higher birefrin-<br>
gence An in order to ensure an adequate optical retardation (d An). How-<br>
ever, the LC materials of high birefringence known from the prior art gen-<br>
erally also have high rotational viscosity at the same time, which in turn<br>
has an adverse effect on the response times. There is therefore a demand<br>
for LC media which simultaneously have fast response times, low rota-<br>
tional viscosities and high birefringence.<br>
 <br>
The invention is based on the object of providing media, in particular for<br>
MLC, TN, STN, FFS or IPS displays of this type, which have the desired<br>
properties indicated above and do not exhibit the disadvantages men-<br>
tioned above or only do so to a lesser extent. In particular, the LC media<br>
should have fast response times and low rotational viscosities at the same<br>
time as high birefringence. In addition, the LC media should have a high<br>
clearing point, high dielectric anisotropy and a low threshold voltage.<br>
It has now been found that this object can be achieved if LC media com-<br>
prising one or more compounds of the formula I are used. The compounds<br>
of the formula I result in mixtures having the desired properties indicated<br>
above.<br>
The invention relates to a liquid-crystalline medium, characterised in that it<br>
comprises one or more compounds of the formula I<br>
 <br>
in which<br>
R° denotes an alkyl or alkoxy radical having 1 to 15 C atoms, where one<br>
or more CH2 groups in these radicals may also each, independently<br>
of one another, be replaced by <br>
  in such a way that O atoms are<br>
not linked directly to one another, and in which, in addition, one or<br>
more H atoms may be replaced by halogen,<br>
X° denotes F, CI, CN, SF5, SCN, NCS, a halogenated alkyl radical, a<br>
halogenated alkenyl radical, a halogenated alkoxy radical or a halo-<br>
genated alkenyloxy radical having up to 6 C atoms.<br>
 <br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that LC media comprising compounds of<br>
the formula I simultaneously have low rotational viscosity γ1 and high<br>
birefringence An, as well as fast response times, a low threshold voltage, a<br>
high clearing point, high positive dielectric anisotropy and a broad nematic<br>
phase range.<br>
The compounds of the formula I have a broad range of applications.<br>
Depending on the choice of substituents, they can serve as base materials<br>
of which liquid-crystalline media are predominantly composed; however,<br>
liquid-crystalline base materials from other classes of compound can also<br>
be added to the compounds of the formula I in order, for example, to mod-<br>
ify the dielectric and/or optical anisotropy of a dielectric of this type and/or<br>
to optimise its threshold voltage and/or its viscosity.<br>

straight-chain alkyl. Particular preference is given to the compounds of the<br>

 <br>

1-20% by weight, particularly preferably 2-15% by weight, of com-<br>
pounds of the formula I;<br>
The proportion of compounds of the formulae ll-XXII in the mixture as<br>

It has been found that even a relatively small proportion of compounds of<br>
the formula I mixed with conventional liquid-crystal materials, but in par-<br>
ticular with one or more compounds of the formulae II to XXII, results in a<br>
significant increase in the light stability and in low birefringence values,<br>
 <br>
with broad nematic phases with low smectic-nematic transition tempera-<br>
tures being observed at the same time, improving the shelf life. At the<br>
same time, the mixtures exhibit very low threshold voltages and very good<br>
values for the VHR on exposure to UV.<br>
The term "alkyl" or "alkyl*" in this application encompasses straight-chain<br>
and branched alkyl groups having 1-7 carbon atoms, in particular the<br>
straight-chain groups methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl and heptyl.<br>
Groups having 1-6 carbon atoms are generally preferred.<br>
The term "alkenyl" or "alkenyl*" in this application encompasses straight-<br>
chain and branched alkenyl groups having 2-7 carbon atoms, in particular<br>
the straight-chain groups. Preferred alkenyl groups are C2-C7-1E-alkenyl,<br>
C4-C7-3E-alkenyl, C5-C7-4-alkenyl, C6-C7-5-alkenyl and C7-6-alkenyl, in<br>
particular C2-C7-1E-alkenyl, C4-C7-3E-alkenyl and C5-C7-4-alkenyl. Exam-<br>
ples of particularly preferred alkenyl groups are vinyl, 1E-propenyl, 1E-<br>
butenyl, 1E-pentenyl, 1E-hexenyl, 1E-heptenyl, 3-butenyl, 3E-pentenyl,<br>
3E-hexenyl, 3E-heptenyl, 4-pentenyl, 4Z-hexenyl, 4E-hexenyl, 4Z-hep-<br>
tenyl, 5-hexenyl, 6-heptenyl and the like. Groups having up to 5 carbon<br>
atoms are generally preferred.<br>
The term "fluoroalkyl" in this application preferably encompasses straight-<br>
chain groups having at least one fluorine atom, preferably a terminal fluo-<br>
rine, i.e. fluoromethyl, 2-fluoroethyl, 3-fluoropropyl, 4-fluorobutyl, 5-fluoro-<br>
pentyl, 6-fluorohexyl and 7-fluoroheptyl. However, other positions of the<br>
fluorine are not excluded.<br>
The term "oxaalkyl" or "alkoxy" in this application preferably encompasses<br>
straight-chain radicals of the formula CnH2n+i-O-(CH2)m&gt; in which n and m<br>
each, independently of one another, denote 1 to 6. m may also denote 0.<br>
Preferably, n = 1 and m = 1-6 or m = 0 and n = 1-3.<br>
Through a suitable choice of the meanings of R° and X°, the addressing<br>
times, the threshold voltage, the steepness of the transmission character-<br>
istic lines, etc., can be modified in the desired manner. For example, 1E-<br>
alkenyl radicals, 3E-alkenyl radicals, 2E-alkenyloxy radicals and the like<br>
 <br>
generally result in shorter addressing times, improved nematic tendencies<br>
and a higher ratio between the elastic constants k33 (bend) and k11 (splay)<br>
compared with alkyl and alkoxy radicals. 4-Alkenyl radicals, 3-alkenyl radi-<br>
cals and the like generally give lower threshold voltages and lower values<br>
of k33/k11 compared with alkyl and alkoxy radicals. The mixtures according<br>
to the invention are distinguished, in particular, by high K1 values and thus<br>
have significantly faster response times than the mixtures from the prior<br>
art.<br>
The optimum mixing ratio of the compounds of the above-mentioned for-<br>
mulae depends substantially on the desired properties, on the choice of<br>
the components of the above-mentioned formulae and on the choice of<br>
any further components that may be present.<br>
Suitable mixing ratios within the range indicated above can easily be<br>
determined from case to case.<br>
The total amount of compounds of the above-mentioned formulae in the<br>
mixtures according to the invention is not crucial. The mixtures can there-<br>
fore comprise one or more further components for the purposes of optimi-<br>
sation of various properties. However, the observed effect on the desired<br>
improvement in the properties of the mixture is generally greater, the<br>
higher the total concentration of compounds of the above-mentioned for-<br>
mulae.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the media according to the inven-<br>
tion comprise compounds of the formulae IV to VIII in which X° denotes F,<br>
OCF3, OCHF2, OCH=CF2, OCF=CF2 or OCF2-CF2H. A favourable syner-<br>
gistic action with the compounds of the formula I results in particularly<br>
advantageous properties. In particular, mixtures comprising compounds of<br>
the formulae I, V and VI are distinguished by their low threshold voltages.<br>
The individual compounds of the above-mentioned formulae and the sub-<br>
formulae thereof which can be used in the media according to the inven-<br>
tion are either known or can be prepared analogously to the known com-<br>
pounds.<br>
 <br>
The invention also relates to electro-optical displays, such as, for example,<br>
TN, STN, FFS, OCB, IPS, FFS or MLC displays, having two plane-parallel<br>
outer plates, which, together with a frame, form a cell, integrated non-<br>
linear elements for switching individual pixels on the outer plates, and a<br>
nematic liquid-crystal mixture having positive dielectric anisotropy and high<br>
specific resistance located in the cell, which contain media of this type, and<br>
to the use of these media for electro-optical purposes.<br>
The liquid-crystal mixtures according to the invention enable a significant<br>
broadening of the available parameter latitude. The achievable combina-<br>
tions of clearing point, viscosity at low temperature, thermal and UV stabil-<br>
ity and high optical anisotropy are far superior to previous materials from<br>
the prior art.<br>
The mixtures according to the invention are particularly suitable for mobile<br>
applications and high-An TFT applications, such as, for example, PDAs,<br>
notebooks, LCD TVs and monitors.<br>
The liquid-crystal mixtures according to the invention, while retaining the<br>
nematic phase down to -20°C and preferably down to -30°C, particularly<br>
preferably down to -40°C, and the clearing point &gt; 70°C, preferably &gt; 75°C,<br>
at the same time allow rotational viscosities yi of 
preferably 
having fast response times to be achieved.<br>
The dielectric anisotropy As of the liquid-crystal mixtures according to the<br>
invention is preferably &gt; +3, particularly preferably &gt; +4. In addition, the<br>
mixtures are characterised by low operating voltages. The threshold volt-<br>
age of the liquid-crystal mixtures according to the invention is preferably<br>

invention is preferably &gt; 0.11, particularly preferably &gt; 0.12.<br>
The nematic phase range of the liquid-crystal mixtures according to the<br>
invention preferably has a width of at least 90°, in particular at least 100°.<br>
This range preferably extends at least from -25°C to +70°C.<br>
 <br>
It goes without saying that, through a suitable choice of the components of<br>
the mixtures according to the invention, it is also possible for higher clear-<br>
ing points (for example above 100°C) to be achieved at higher threshold<br>
voltages or lower clearing points to be achieved at lower threshold volt-<br>
ages with retention of the other advantageous properties. At viscosities<br>
correspondingly increased only slightly, it is likewise possible to obtain<br>
mixtures having a higher As and thus low thresholds. The MLC displays<br>
according to the invention preferably operate at the first Gooch and Tarry<br>
transmission minimum [C.H. Gooch and H.A. Tarry, Electron. Lett. 10, 2-4,<br>
1974; C.H. Gooch and H.A. Tarry, Appl. Phys., Vol. 8, 1575-1584, 1975],<br>
where, besides particularly favourable electro-optical properties, such as,<br>
for example, high steepness of the characteristic line and low angle<br>
dependence of the contrast (German patent 30 22 818), lower dielectric<br>
anisotropy is sufficient at the same threshold voltage as in an analogous<br>
display at the second minimum. This enables significantly higher specific<br>
resistance values to be achieved using the mixtures according to the<br>
invention at the first minimum than in the case of mixtures comprising<br>
cyano compounds. Through a suitable choice of the individual compo-<br>
nents and their proportions by weight, the person skilled in the art is able<br>
to set the birefringence necessary for a pre-specified layer thickness of<br>
the MLC display using simple routine methods.<br>
Measurements of the voltage holding ratio (HR) [S. Matsumoto et al.,<br>
Liquid Crystals 5, 1320 (1989); K. Niwa et al., Proc. SID Conference, San<br>
Francisco, June 1984, p. 304 (1984); G. Weber et al., Liquid Crystals 5,<br>
1381 (1989)] have shown that mixtures according to the invention com-<br>
prising compounds of the formula I exhibit a significantly smaller decrease<br>
in the HR on UV exposure than analogous mixtures comprising cyano-<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The light stability and UV stability of the mixtures according to the invention<br>
are considerably better, i.e. they exhibit a significantly smaller decrease in<br>
the HR on exposure to light or UV. Even low concentrations of the com-<br>
pounds {
by 6% or more compared with mixtures from the prior art.<br>
The construction of the MLC display according to the invention from polar-<br>
isers, electrode base plates and surface-treated electrodes corresponds to<br>
the usual design for displays of this type. The term usual design is broadly<br>
drawn here and also encompasses all derivatives and modifications of the<br>
MLC display, in particular including matrix display elements based on<br>
poly-Si TFTs or MIM.<br>
A significant difference between the displays according to the invention<br>
and the hitherto conventional displays based on the twisted nematic cell<br>
consists, however, in the choice of the liquid-crystal parameters of the<br>
liquid-crystal layer.<br>
The liquid-crystal mixtures which can be used in accordance with the<br>
invention are prepared in a manner conventional per se, for example by<br>
mixing one or more compounds of the formula I with one or more com-<br>
pounds of the formulae li-XXll or with further liquid-crystalline compounds<br>
and/or additives. In general, the desired amount of the components used<br>
in lesser amount is dissolved in the components making up the principal<br>
constituent, advantageously at elevated temperature. It is also possible to<br>
mix solutions of the components in an organic solvent, for example in<br>
acetone, chloroform or methanol, and to remove the solvent again, for<br>
example by distillation, after thorough mixing.<br>
The dielectrics may also comprise further additives known to the person<br>
skilled in the art and described in the literature, such as, for example, UV<br>
stabilisers, such as Tinuvin® from Ciba, antioxidants, free-radical scaven-<br>
gers, nanoparticles, etc. For example,O-15% of pleochroic dyes or chiral<br>
dopants can be added. Suitable stabilisers and dopants are mentioned<br>
below in Tables C and D.<br>
 <br>
In the present application and in the examples below, the structures of the<br>
liquid-crystal compounds are indicated by means of acronyms, the trans-<br>
