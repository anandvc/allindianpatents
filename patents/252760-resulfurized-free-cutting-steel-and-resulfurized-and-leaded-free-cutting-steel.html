				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a resulfurized free cutting steel and<br>
resulfurized and leaded free cutting steel, particularly, to a low carbon free<br>
cutting steel to which lead is not added or in which the lead addition amount is<br>
markedly decreased from the conventional level of 0.15 to 0.35 mass %, which is<br>
adapted for use as a substitute steel for the<br>
conventional low carbon resulfurized and leaded free<br>
cutting steel, to a low carbon resulfurized and leaded<br>
free cutting steel superior in machinability to the<br>
conventional low carbon resulfurized and leaded steel.<br>
and to a resulfurized or resulfurized and leaded free<br>
cutting steel having an oxygen concentration lower than<br>
that in the prior art, low in the surface flaw, and<br>
excellent in machinability.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
A low carbon resulfurized and leaded free cutting<br>
steel, in which lead (Pb) and sulfur (S) are added as<br>
the free cutting elements to a low carbon steel for<br>
imparting a free-cutting capability to the steel, is<br>
known as a low carbon free cutting steel. However,<br>
there is a requirement for suppressing the use of Pb,<br><br>
which is used as one of the free cutting elements, in<br>
view of the earth environmental problem.<br>
Such being the situation, Japanese Patent<br>
Disclosure (Kokai) No. 9-25539 (hereinafter referred to<br>
as "prior art 1") discloses a free cutting microalloyed<br>
steel without quenching and tempering to which Pb is<br>
not added. In this case, Nd is added to the steel for<br>
promoting the finely dispersed precipitation of MnS.<br>
Japanese Patent Disclosure No. 2000-160284 (hereinafter<br>
referred to as "prior art 2") also discloses a free<br>
cutting steel to which Pb is not added. In this case, a<br>
large amount of S is added to the steel so as to<br>
increase the amount of the sulfide, and the form of the<br>
sulfide is controlled by oxygen. Further, Japanese<br>
Patent Publication (Kokoku) No. 2-6824 (hereinafter<br>
referred to as "prior art 3") discloses a free cutting<br>
steel, in which Cr having a reactivity with S to form a<br>
compound higher than that of Mn is added to the steel<br>
so as to form CrS in place of MnS, thereby improving<br>
the free-cutting capability.<br>
However, prior art 1 is directed to a microalloyed<br>
steel containing 0.2 to 0.6% of C without quenching and<br>
tempering. In addition, a special element of Nd is used<br>
in prior art. It follows that it is impossible to<br>
comply sufficiently with the requirement for the cost<br>
reduction. Also, a large amount of S is added to the<br>
steel in prior art 2, with the result that the hot<br><br>
ductility of the steel tends to be lowered. Further,<br>
prior art 3 necessitates the addition of a large amount<br>
reaching 3.5 to 5.9% of costly Cr, resulting in failure<br>
to comply sufficiently with the requirement for the<br>
cost reduction. In addition, formation of a large<br>
amount of CrS as in prior art 3 is disadvantageous<br>
because the difficulty accompanying the smelting of the<br>
material is increased by the presence of a large amount<br>
of CrS.<br>
There is a strong requirement for the further<br>
improvement in the machinability of the low carbon<br>
resulfurized and leaded free cutting steel in view of<br>
the reduction in the machining cost.<br>
In compliance with the requirement, Japanese<br>
Patent Disclosure No. 1-32302 (hereinafter referred to<br>
as "prior art 4") discloses a free cutting steel, in<br>
which a relatively large amount of S is added to the<br>
steel so as to increase the amount of the sulfide, and<br>
the form of the sulfide is controlled by Te, and the<br>
oxygen amount is suppressed to 0.0030% or less so as to<br>
decrease the number of alumina clusters, thereby<br>
improving the machinability of the free cutting steel.<br>
Also, Japanese Patent Disclosure No. 1-309946<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "prior art 5") discloses a<br>
free cutting steel, in which a relatively large amount<br>
of S is added to the steel so as to increase the amount<br>
of the sulfide, and a free cutting element of Pb is<br><br>
added to the steel so as to improve the machinability<br>
of the free cutting steel. Prior art 5 also teaches<br>
that the oxygen amount is suppressed to 0.008% or less<br>
for preventing the streak flaw caused by the gigantic<br>
oxide.<br>
In each of prior arts 4 and 5, however, the form<br>
of the sulfide which effective for improving the<br>
machinability of the free cutting steel cannot be<br>
controlled sufficiently because the oxygen content of<br>
the steel is low, with the result that an elongated<br>
sulfide comes to be present in the steel. It follows<br>
that the free cutting steel is incapable of producing a<br>
sufficient effect of improving the machinability of the<br>
free cutting steel. Also, as described previously, the<br>
free cutting steel of prior art 2 is excellent in<br>
machinability because the form of a large amount of the<br>
sulfide is controlled by oxygen. However, the hot<br>
ductility of the free cutting steel tends to be lowered<br>
because a large amount of S is added to the steel.<br>
On the other hand, the resulfurized and<br>
resulfurized and leaded free cutting steels contain in<br>
general a large amount of oxygen in order to control<br>
the form of the sulfide which is effective for<br>
improving the machinability of the free cutting steel.<br>
However, since all the oxygen does not dissolve in the<br>
sulfide, it is unavoidable for a gigantic oxide to be<br>
formed so as to cause the streak flaw, thereby giving<br><br>
rise to a serious defect in the processed article.<br>
In prior art 5, the oxygen content of steel is<br>
suppressed to 0.008% or less in order to avoid<br>
generation of the streak flaw. In prior art 2, the<br>
required amount of oxygen is decreased by increasing<br>
the addition amount of S. Further, in prior art 1, the<br>
required amount of oxygen is decreased by using Nd as a<br>
free cutting element.<br>
In prior art 5, however, the oxygen amount is<br>
simply decreased, though the oxygen amount is limited<br>
to 0.008% or less. Therefore, the form of the sulfide<br>
cannot be sufficiently controlled, as desired, with the<br>
result that an elongated sulfide comes to be present in<br>
the steel. It follows that the free cutting steel<br>
disclosed in prior art 5 cannot be said to be<br>
satisfactory in terms of the machinability. Also,<br>
concerning the free cutting steel disclosed in prior<br>
art 2, the reduction in the hot ductility caused by S<br>
is worried about as pointed out previously. Further, in<br>
prior art 1, as described above, there is a problem<br>
that it is difficult to reduce the cost.<br>

The present invention will now be described in<br>
detail.<br>
1. First Free cutting steel;<br>
A first free cutting steel is provided by the low<br>
carbon free cutting steel according to the first aspect<br>
of the present invention, containing 0.02 to 0.15<br>
mass % of C, 0.05 to 1.8 mass % of Mn, 0.20 to 0.49<br>
mass % of S, more than 0.01 mass % and not more than<br>
0.03 mass % of 0, 0.3 to 2.3% of Cr, and the balance<br>
consisting of Fe and inevitable impurities, the Cr/S<br>
ratio falling within a range of between 2 and 6.<br>
It is possible for the first free cutting steel of<br>
the present invention to further contain not more than<br>
0.1 mass % of Si, 0.01 to 0.12 mass % of P, and not<br>
more than 0.01 mass % of Al.<br>
It is also possible for the first free cutting<br>
steel of the present invention to further contain at<br>
least one element selected from the group consisting of<br>
0.0001 to 0.0005 mass % of Ca, 0.01 to 0.03 mass % of<br><br>
Pb, 0.02 to 0.30 mass % of Se, 0.1 to 0.15 mass % of Te,<br>
0.02 to 0.20 mass % of Bi, 0.003 to 0.020 mass % of Sn,<br>
0.004 to 0.010 mass % of B, 0.005 to 0.015 mass % of N,<br>
0.05 to 0.50 mass % of Cu, 0.003 to 0.090 mass % of Ti,<br>
0.005 to 0.200 mass % of V, 0.005 to 0.090 mass % of Zr,<br>
and 0.0005 to 0.0080 mass % of Mg.<br>
In the free cutting steel of the composition<br>
described above, it is desirable for the sulfide having<br>
the major axis of at least 10 µm to occupy at least 90%<br>
of all the sulfides. It is also desirable for sulfide<br>
having an aspect ratio not larger than 5 to occupy at<br>
least 80% of the sulfides having the major axis at<br>
least 10 µm. Further, it is desirable for the<br>
particular free cutting steel to have a ferrite-<br>
pearlite micro structure with a prior austenite grain<br>
diameter exceeding the grain size number 7.<br>
As a result of an extensive research conducted in<br>
an effort to achieve the first object described above,<br>
the present inventors have found that:<br>
(i) It is possible to obtain a suitable amount of<br>
a sulfide containing both Cr and Mn by the addition of<br>
suitable amounts of Cr, Mn and S and by optimizing the<br>
Cr/S ratio. Since the sulfide containing both Cr and Mn<br>
suppresses the elongation in the hot working step, it<br>
is possible to allow the sulfide to be large and to be<br>
formed like a spindle.<br>
(ii) In view of the idea known to the art that,<br><br>
where the S amount is the same, the machinability of<br>
the free cutting steel is improved with increase in the<br>
size of the sulfide and with change in the form of the<br>
sulfide toward the spindle shape, it is considered<br>
reasonable to understand that a large and spindle-<br>
shaped sulfide is formed by the addition of suitable<br>
amounts of Cr, Mn and S and by the optimization of the<br>
Cr/S ratio, thereby improving the machinability of the<br>
free cutting steel including the chip disposability and<br>
the surface roughness.<br>
(iii) It is known to the art that the<br>
machinability is improved with increase in the S amount.<br>
However, there is an upper limit in the S amount<br>
because of the problem in terms of the anisotropy in<br>
the hot workability or the mechanical properties. On<br>
the other hand, if a large and spindle-shaped sulfide<br>
is formed by the addition of suitable amounts of Cr, Mn<br>
and S and by the optimization of the Cr/S ration as<br>
described above, it is possible to elevate the upper<br>
limit of the S amount. As a result, the machinability<br>
of the free cutting steel including the chip<br>
disposability and the surface roughness can be markedly<br>
improved, even if Pb is not added or even if the Pb<br>
amount is markedly lowered from the level in the prior<br>
art.<br>
It is possible for the first free cutting steel<br>
described above, which has been obtained on the basis<br><br>
of the ideas given above, to exhibit a machinability<br>
fully comparable to or higher than that exhibited by<br>
the conventional low carbon resulfurized and leaded<br>
free cutting steel without obstruction the cost<br>
reduction and without lowering the hot ductility, even<br>
if lead is not added to the free cutting steel or even<br>
if the lead addition amount is markedly lowered from<br>
the level in the conventional low carbon resulfurized<br>
and leaded free cutting steel.<br>
The reasons for defining the composition of the<br>
first free cutting steel as described above will now be<br>
described.<br>
(a)	C: 0.02 to 0.15 mass %<br>
Carbon, which seriously affects the strength and<br>
the machinability of the steel, is an important element.<br>
However, if the C content is lower than 0.02 mass %, it<br>
is impossible to obtain a sufficient strength of the<br>
steel. On the other hand, if the C content exceeds 0.15<br>
mass %, the strength of the steel is rendered<br>
excessively high so as to deteriorate the machinability<br>
of the steel. Such being the situation, the C content<br>
is defined in the present invention to fall within a<br>
range of between 0.02 mass % and 0.15 mass %.<br>
Preferably, the C content should fall within a range of<br>
between 0.02 mass % and 0.10 mass %.<br>
(b)	Mn: 0.05 to 1.8 mass %<br>
Manganese is a sulfide formation element that is<br><br>
important for improving the machinability of the steel.<br>
However, if the Mn content is lower than 0.05 mass %,<br>
the amount of the sulfide formed is excessively small,<br>
resulting in failure to obtain a sufficient<br>
machinability. On the other hand, if the Mn content<br>
exceeds 1.8 mass %, the formed sulfide is much<br>
elongated, with the result that the machinability of<br>
steel is lowered. Such being the situation, the Mn<br>
content is defined in the present invention to fall<br>
within a range of between 0.05 and 1.8 mass %.<br>
Preferably, the Mn content should be not lower than<br>
0.22 mass % and lower than 0.60 mass %.<br>
(c)	S: 0.20 to 0.49 mass %<br>
Sulfur is a sulfide formation element which forms<br>
a sulfide effective for improving the machinability of<br>
the steel. However, if the S content is lower than 0.20<br>
mass %, the amount of the sulfide formed is excessively<br>
small, resulting in failure to obtain a sufficient<br>
effect for improving the machinability of the steel. On<br>
the other hand, if the S content exceeds 0.49 mass %,<br>
the hot workability and the ductility of the steel are<br>
markedly lowered. Such being the situation, the S<br>
content of steel is defined in the present invention to<br>
fall within a range of between 0.20 and 0.49 mass %.<br>
(d)	0: higher than 0.01 mass % and not higher<br>
than 0.03 mass %<br>
Oxygen is an element effective for suppressing the<br><br>
elongation of the sulfide in the hot working step such<br>
as a rolling step. Therefore, oxygen is an element<br>
important for improving the machinability of the steel<br>
by suppressing the elongation of the sulfide. However,<br>
if the O content is not higher than 0.01 mass %, it is<br>
difficult to obtain a sufficient effect of suppressing<br>
the elongation of the sulfide. Since the elongated<br>
sulfide remains in the steel, it is impossible to<br>
obtain a sufficient effect of improving the<br>
machinability of the steel. On the other hand, even if<br>
the O addition amount exceeds 0.03 mass %, the effect<br>
of suppressing the elongation of the sulfide is<br>
saturated. It follows that the addition of an<br>
excessively large amount of O is disadvantageous in<br>
economy. In addition, a casting defect such a blow-hole<br>
is generated. Under the circumstances, the O content is<br>
defined in the present invention to exceed 0.01 mass %<br>
and to be not higher than 0.03 mass %.<br>
(e) Cr: 0.3 to 2.3 mass %<br>
Chromium is an element effective for suppressing<br>
the elongation of the sulfide in the hot working step<br>
such as a rolling step. Therefore, Cr is an element<br>
important for improving the machinability of the steel<br>
by suppressing the elongation of the sulfide. However,<br>
if the Cr content is lower than 0.3 mass %, it is<br>
difficult to obtain a sufficient effect of suppressing<br>
the elongation of the sulfide. Since the elongated<br><br>
sulfide remains in the steel, it is impossible to<br>
obtain a sufficient effect of improving the<br>
machinability of the steel. On the other hand, even if<br>
the Cr addition amount exceeds 2.3 mass %, the effect<br>
of suppressing the elongation of the sulfide is<br>
saturated. It follows that the addition of an<br>
excessively large amount of Cr is disadvantageous in<br>
economy. Under the circumstances, the Cr content is<br>
defined in the present invention to fall within a range<br>
of between 0.3 mass % and 2.3 mass %. Preferably, the<br>
Cr content should fall within a range of between 0.3<br>
mass % and 1.5 mass %.<br>
(f) Cr/S ratio: 2 to 6<br>
The Cr/S ratio is an important index seriously<br>
affecting the degree of elongation of the sulfide in<br>
the hot working step such as a rolling step. It is<br>
possible to obtain a sulfide having a desired degree of<br>
elongation, which permits improving the machinability<br>
of the steel, by defining the Cr/S ratio appropriately.<br>
If the Cr/S ratio is smaller than 2, the sulfide<br>
elongated by the formation of MnS is rendered prominent<br>
so as to deteriorate the machinability of the steel. On<br>
the other hand, if the Cr/S ratio exceeds 6, the effect<br>
of suppressing the elongation of the sulfide is<br>
saturated. Such being the situation, the Cr/S ratio is<br>
defined in the present invention to fall within a range<br>
of between 2 and 6. Preferably, the Cr/S ratio should<br><br>
fall within a range of between 2 and 4.<br>
The conditions given above are absolutely<br>
necessary for the first free cutting steel of the<br>
present invention. The other conditions of the first<br>
free cutting steel are as follows:<br>
(g) Si: 0.1 mass % or less<br>
Silicon is a deoxidizing element. Since the oxide<br>
of Si acts as a nucleus of the sulfide formation, Si<br>
promotes the sulfide formation so as to pulverize<br>
finely the sulfide, with the result that the tool life<br>
is shortened. Such being the situation, where it is<br>
desired to further prolong the tool life, it is<br>
desirable to define the Si content not to exceed 0.1<br>
mass %. More desirably, the Si content of the steel<br>
should not exceed 0.03 mass %.<br>
(h) P: 0.01 to 0.12 mass %<br>
Phosphorus is an element effective for suppressing<br>
the formation of the built-up edge in the cutting<br>
process step so as to lower the finish surface<br>
roughness. However, if the P content is lower than 0.01<br>
mass %, it is difficult to obtain a sufficient effect.<br>
On the other hand, if the P content exceeds 0.12 mass %,<br>
the effect noted above is saturated. Also, the hot<br>
workability and the ductility of the steel are markedly<br>
lowered. Such being the situation, the P content is<br>
defined in the present invention to fall within a range<br>
of between 0.01 mass % and 0.12 mass %. Preferably, the<br><br>
P content should fall within a range of between 0.01<br>
mass % and 0.09 mass %.<br>
(i) Al: 0.01 mass % or less<br>
Aluminum is a deoxidizing element like Si. Since<br>
the oxide of Al acts as a nucleus of the sulfide<br>
formation, Al promotes the sulfide formation so as to<br>
pulverize finely the sulfide, with the result that the<br>
tool life is shortened. Such being the situation, where<br>
it is desired to further prolong the tool life, it is<br>
desirable to define the Al content not to exceed 0.01<br>
mass %. More desirably, the Al content of the steel<br>
should not exceed 0.003 mass %.<br>
(j) At least one of:<br>
Ca: 0.0001 to 0.0005 mass %;<br>
Pb: 0.01 to 0.03 mass %;<br>
Se: 0.02 to 0.30 mass %;<br>
Te: 0.1 to 0.15 mass %;<br>
Bi: 0.02 to 0.20 mass %;<br>
Sn: 0.003 to 0.020 mass %;<br>
B: 0.004 to 0.010 mass %;<br>
N: 0.005 to 0.015 mass %;<br>
Cu: 0.05 to 0.50 mass %;<br>
Ti: 0.003 to 0.090 mass %;<br>
V: 0.005 to 0.200 mass %;<br>
Zr: 0.005 to 0.090 mass %;<br>
Mg: 0.0005 to 0.0080 mass %.<br>
Any of Ca, Pb, Se, Te, Bi, Sn, B, N, Cu, Ti, V, Zr<br><br>
and Mg is used in the case where it is important to<br>
improve the machinability of the steel. However, if the<br>
addition amount of each of these elements is smaller<br>
than the lower limit noted above, the effect of<br>
improving the machinability of the steel cannot be<br>
obtained. On the other hand, where the addition amount<br>
of each of these elements exceeds the upper limit noted<br>
above, the effect of improving the machinability of the<br>
steel is saturated. Also, the addition of an<br>
excessively large amount of each of these elements is<br>
disadvantageous in economy. Under the circumstances, in<br>
the case of adding these elements, these elements<br>
should be added such that Ca falls within a range of<br>
between 0.0001 and 0.0005 mass %, Pb falls within a<br>
range of between 0.01 and 0.03 mass %, Se falls within<br>
a range of between 0.02 and 0.30 mass %, Te falls<br>
within a range of between 0.1 and 0.15 mass %, Bi falls<br>
within a range of between 0.02 and 0.20 mass %, Sn<br>
falls within a range of between 0.003 and 0.020 mass %,<br>
B falls within a range of between 0.004 and 0.010<br>
mass %, N falls within a range of between 0.005 and<br>
0.015 mass %, Cu falls within a range of between 0.05<br>
and 0.50 mass %, Ti falls within a range of between<br>
0.003 and 0.090 mass %, V falls within a range of<br>
between 0.005 and 0.200 mass %, Zr falls within a range<br>
of between 0.005 and 0.090 mass %, and Mg falls within<br>
a range of between 0.0005 and 0.0080 mass %.<br><br>
(k) Micro structure<br>
It is desirable for the micro structure of the<br>
first free cutting steel to be a ferrite pearlite-based<br>
structure. Concerning the machinability of the steel,<br>
it is advantageous for the prior austenite grain size<br>
to be large. However, a satisfactory machinability can<br>
be maintained even in the case of fine grains. In view<br>
of the mechanical properties of the article, it is<br>
desirable for the grains to be fine such that the grain<br>
size exceeds the grain size number 7 (grain size<br>
measured by the method of measuring austenite grain<br>
size specified in JIS (Japanese Industrial Standards) G<br>
0551).<br>
(1) Size of Sulfide<br>
Concerning the machinability of the steel, it is<br>
advantageous for the sulfide to grow into a large body.<br>
To be more specific, it is desirable for the major axis<br>
of the sulfide to be at least 10 µm. It is also<br>
desirable for the sulfide having the major axis of at<br>
least 10 µm to occupy at least 90% of all the sulfides.<br>
(m) Aspect Ratio of Sulfide<br>
The aspect ratio of the sulfide is represented by<br>
L/d, where "L" denotes the major axis and "d" denotes<br>
the minor axis of the sulfide, as shown in FIG. 1.<br>
Concerning the machinability of the steel, it is<br>
advantageous for the sulfide to be formed like a<br>
spindle. Therefore, it is desirable for the sulfide to<br><br>
have an aspect ratio not larger than 5. It is also<br>
desirable for the sulfide having an aspect ratio not<br>
larger than 5 to occupy at least 80% of the sulfide<br>
having the major axis of at least 10 µm.<br>
2. Second Free cutting steel<br>
A second free cutting steel is provided by the low<br>
carbon free cutting steel according to the second<br>
aspect of the present invention, containing 0.02 to<br>
0.15 mass % of C, 0.05 to 1.00 mass % of Mn, 0.20 to<br>
0.49 mass % of S, more than 0.008 mass % and not more<br>
than 0.030 mass% of 0, 0.04 to 0.35 mass % of Pb, 0.3<br>
to 2.3% of Cr, and the balance consisting of Fe and<br>
inevitable impurities, the Cr/S ratio falling within a<br>
range of between 2 and 6.<br>
It is possible for the second free cutting steel<br>
of the present invention to further contain not more<br>
than 0.1 mass % of Si, 0.01 to 0.12 mass % of P, and<br>
not more than 0.01 mass % of Al.<br>
It is also possible for the second free cutting<br>
steel of the present invention to further contain at<br>
least one element selected from the group consisting of<br>
0.0001 to 0.0005 mass % of Ca, 0.02 to 0.30 mass % of<br>
Se, 0.1 to 0.15 mass % of Te, 0.02 to 0.20 mass % of Bi,<br>
0.003 to 0.020 mass % of Sn, 0.004 to 0.010 mass % of B,<br>
0.005 to 0.015 mass % of N, 0.05 to 0.50 mass % of Cu,<br>
0.003 to 0.090 mass % of Ti, 0.005 to 0.200 mass % of V,<br>
0.005 to 0.090 mass % of Zr, and 0.0005 to 0.0080<br><br>
mass % of Mg.<br>
As a result of an extensive research conducted in<br>
an effort to achieve the second object described above,<br>
the present inventors have found that:<br>
(i) As described above, it is possible to obtain<br>
a suitable amount of a sulfide containing both Cr and<br>
Mn by the addition of suitable amounts of Cr, Mn and S<br>
and by optimizing the Cr/S ratio. Since the sulfide<br>
containing both Cr and Mn suppresses the elongation in<br>
the hot working step, it is possible to improve the<br>
machinability of the steel including the chip<br>
disposability and the surface roughness by allowing the<br>
sulfide to be large and to be formed like a spindle.<br>
(ii) If a large and spindle-shaped sulfide is<br>
formed by the addition of suitable amounts of Cr, Mn<br>
and S and by the optimization of the Cr/S ratio as<br>
described above, it is possible to elevate the upper<br>
limit of the S amount. As a result, it is possible to<br>
improve the machinability of the free cutting steel<br>
including the chip disposability and the surface<br>
roughness.<br>
(iii) The effects described above are combined<br>
with the effect produced by the free cutting element of<br>
Pb so as to improve markedly the machinability of the<br>
free cutting steel including the chip disposability and<br>
the surface roughness.<br>
The second free cutting steel of the present<br><br>
invention, which has been achieved on the basis of the<br>
ideas given above, exhibits a machinability superior to<br>
that exhibited in the past without increasing the lead<br>
amount and the sulfur amount from the levels in the<br>
prior art.<br>
The reasons for defining the composition of the<br>
second free cutting steel as described above will now<br>
be described.<br>
(a)	C: 0.02 to 0.15 mass %<br>
If the C content is lower than 0.02 mass %, it is<br>
impossible to obtain a sufficient strength of the steel,<br>
as described previously in conjunction with the first<br>
free cutting steel. On the other hand, if the C content<br>
exceeds 0.15 mass %, the strength of the steel is<br>
rendered excessively high so as to deteriorate the<br>
machinability of the steel. Such being the situation,<br>
the C content is defined in the present invention to<br>
fall within a range of between 0.02 mass % and 0.15<br>
mass %. Preferably, the C content should fall within a<br>
range of between 0.02 mass % and 0.10 mass %.<br>
(b)	Mn: 0.05 to 1.00 mass %<br>
Manganese is an element important for improving<br>
the machinability of the steel. However, if the Mn<br>
content is lower than 0.05 mass %, the amount of the<br>
sulfide formed is excessively small, resulting in<br>
failure to obtain a sufficient machinability. On the<br>
other hand, if the Mn content exceeds 1.00 mass %, the<br><br>
formed sulfide is much elongated, with the result that<br>
the machinability of steel is lowered. Such being the<br>
situation, the Mn content is defined in the present<br>
invention to fall within a range of between 0.05 and<br>
1.00 mass %. Preferably, the Mn content should be not<br>
lower than 0.22 mass % and lower than 0.60 mass %.<br>
(c)	S: 0.20 to 0.49 mass %<br>
If the S content is lower than 0.20 mass %, the<br>
amount of the sulfide formed is excessively small,<br>
resulting in failure to obtain a sufficient effect for<br>
improving the machinability of the steel, as described<br>
previously in conjunction with the first free cutting<br>
steel of the present invention. On the other hand, if<br>
the S content exceeds 0.49 mass %, the hot workability<br>
and the ductility of the steel are markedly lowered.<br>
Such being the situation, the S content of the steel is<br>
defined in the present invention to fall within a range<br>
of between 0.20 and 0.49 mass %.<br>
(d)	O: higher than 0.008 mass % and not higher<br>
than 0.03 mass %<br>
Oxygen is an element effective for suppressing the<br>
elongation of the sulfide in the hot working step such<br>
as a rolling step. Therefore, oxygen is an element<br>
important for improving the machinability of the steel<br>
by suppressing the elongation of the sulfide. However,<br>
if the O content is not higher than 0.008 mass %, it is<br>
difficult to obtain a sufficient effect of suppressing<br><br>
the elongation of the sulfide. Since the elongated<br>
sulfide remains in the steel, it is impossible to<br>
obtain a sufficient effect of improving the<br>
machinability of the steel. On the other hand, even if<br>
the 0 addition amount exceeds 0.030 mass %, the effect<br>
of suppressing the elongation of the sulfide is<br>
saturated. It follows that the addition of an<br>
excessively large amount of O is disadvantageous in<br>
economy. In addition, a casting defect such a blow-hole<br>
is generated. Under the circumstances, the O content is<br>
defined in the present invention to exceed 0.008 mass %<br>
and to be not higher than 0.03 mass %.<br>
(e)	Pb: 0.04 to 0.35 mass %<br>
Lead is an element important for improving the<br>
machinability of the steel. However, if the Pb content<br>
of the steel is lower than 0.04 mass %, it is<br>
impossible to obtain a sufficient effect of improving<br>
the machinability of the steel. On the other hand, even<br>
if Pb is added in a large amount exceeding 0.35 mass %,<br>
the effect of improving the machinability of the steel<br>
is saturated. Also, the hot workability of the steel is<br>
markedly lowered. Such being the situation, the Pb<br>
content of the steel is defined in the present<br>
invention to fall within a range of between 0.04 mass %<br>
and 0.35 mass %.<br>
(f)	Cr: 0.3 to 2.3 mass %<br>
If the Cr content is lower than 0.3 mass %, it is<br><br>
difficult to obtain a sufficient effect of suppressing<br>
the elongation of the sulfide, as described previously<br>
in conjunction with the first free-cutting steel of the<br>
present invention. Since the elongated sulfide remains<br>
in the steel, it is impossible to obtain a sufficient<br>
effect of improving the machinability of the steel. On<br>
the other hand, even if the Cr addition amount exceeds<br>
2.3 mass %, the effect of suppressing the elongation of<br>
the sulfide is saturated. It follows that the addition<br>
of an excessively large amount of Cr is disadvantageous<br>
in economy. Under the circumstances, the Cr content is<br>
defined in the present invention to fall within a range<br>
of between 0.3 mass % and 2.3 mass %. Preferably, the<br>
Cr content should fall within a range of between 0.3<br>
mass % and 1.4 mass %.<br>
(g) Cr/S ratio: 2 to 6<br>
The Cr/S ratio is important in the second free<br>
cutting steel as in the first free cutting steel. If<br>
the Cr/S ratio is smaller than 2, the sulfide elongated<br>
by the formation of MnS is rendered prominent so as to<br>
deteriorate the machinability of the steel. On the<br>
other hand, if the Cr/S ratio exceeds 6, the effect of<br>
suppressing the elongation of the sulfide is saturated.<br>
Such being the situation, the Cr/S ratio is defined in<br>
the present invention to fall within a range of between<br>
2 and 6. Preferably, the Cr/S ratio should fall within<br>
a range of between 2 and 4.<br><br>
The conditions given above are absolutely<br>
necessary for the second free cutting steel of the<br>
present invention. The other conditions of the second<br>
free cutting steel are as follows:<br>
(h) Si: 0.1 mass % or less<br>
As described previously, Si shortens the tool life.<br>
Such being the situation, where it is desired to<br>
further prolong the tool life, it is desirable to<br>
define the Si content not to exceed 0.1 mass % as in<br>
the first free cutting steel of the present invention.<br>
More desirably, the Si content of the steel should not<br>
exceed 0.03 mass %.<br>
(i) P: 0.01 to 0.12 mass %<br>
If the P content is lower than 0.01 mass %, it is<br>
difficult to obtain a sufficient effect of suppressing<br>
the finish surface roughness of the steel, as in the<br>
first free cutting steel. On the other hand, if the P<br>
content exceeds 0.12 mass %, the effect noted above is<br>
saturated. Also, the hot workability and the ductility<br>
of the steel are markedly lowered. Such being the<br>
situation, the P content is defined in the present<br>
invention to fall within a range of between 0.01 mass %<br>
and 0.12 mass %. Preferably, the P content should fall<br>
within a range of between 0.01 mass % and 0.09 mass %.<br>
(j) Al: 0.01 mass % or less<br>
Aluminum shortens the tool life as described<br>
previously in conjunction with the first free cutting<br><br>
steel. Therefore, where it is desired to further<br>
prolong the tool life, it is desirable to define the Al<br>
content not to exceed 0.01 mass %. More desirably, the<br>
Al content of the steel should not exceed 0.003 mass %.<br>
(k) At least one of:<br>
Ca: 0.0001 to 0.0005 mass %;<br>
Se: 0.02 to 0.30 mass %;<br>
Te: 0.1 to 0.15 mass %;<br>
Bi: 0.02 to 0.20 mass %;<br>
Sn: 0.003 to 0.020 mass %;<br>
B: 0.004 to 0.010 mass %;<br>
N: 0.005 to 0.015 mass %;<br>
Cu: 0.05 to 0.50 mass %;<br>
Ti: 0.003 to 0.090 mass %;<br>
V: 0.005 to 0.200 mass %;<br>
Zr: 0.005 to 0.090 mass %;<br>
Mg: 0.0005 to 0.0080 mass %.<br>
Any of Ca, Se, Te, Bi, Sn, B, N, Cu, Ti, V, Zr and<br>
Mg is used in the case where it is important to improve<br>
the machinability of the steel. However, if the<br>
addition amount of each of these elements is smaller<br>
than the lower limit noted above, the effect of<br>
improving the machinability of the steel cannot be<br>
obtained. On the other hand, where the addition amount<br>
of each of these elements exceeds the upper limit noted<br>
above, the effect of improving the machinability of the<br>
steel is saturated. Also, the addition of an<br><br>
excessively large amount of each of these elements is<br>
disadvantageous in economy. Under the circumstances, in<br>
the case of adding these elements, these elements<br>
should be added such that Ca falls within a range of<br>
between 0.0001 and 0.0005 mass %, Se falls within a<br>
range of between 0.02 and 0.30 mass %, Te falls within<br>
a range of between 0.1 and 0.15 mass %, Bi falls within<br>
a range of between 0.02 and 0.20 mass %, Sn falls<br>
within a range of between 0.003 and 0.020 mass %, B<br>
falls within a range of between 0.004 and 0.010 mass %,<br>
N falls within a range of between 0.005 and 0.015<br>
mass %, Cu falls within a range of between 0.05 and<br>
0.50 mass %, Ti falls within a range of between 0.003<br>
and 0.090 mass %, V falls within a range of between<br>
0.005 and 0.200 mass %, Zr falls within a range of<br>
between 0.005 and 0.090 mass %, and Mg falls within a<br>
range of between 0.0005 and 0.0080 mass %.<br>
(1) Micro structure<br>
It is desirable for the micro structure of the<br>
second free cutting steel to be a ferrite • pearlite-<br>
based structure like the micro structure of the first<br>
free cutting steel described previously. Concerning the<br>
machinability of the steel, it is advantageous for the<br>
prior austenite grain size to be large. However, a<br>
satisfactory machinability can be maintained even in<br>
the case of fine grains. In view of the mechanical<br>
properties of the article, it is desirable for the<br><br>
grains to be fine such that the grain size exceeds the<br>
grain size number 7.<br>
3. Third free cutting steel<br>
The third free cutting steel of the present<br>
invention is a resulfurized or resulfurized and leaded<br>
free cutting steel small according to the third aspect<br>
of the present invention, the free cutting steel<br>
containing 0.16 to 0.49 mass % of S and 0.002 to 0.010%<br>
of O. In the third free cutting steel of the present<br>
invention, the sulfide having an aspect ratio not<br>
larger than 5 occupies at least 80% of the sulfides<br>
having the major axis of at least 10 Mm.<br>
The specific free cutting steel, which permits<br>
realizing the particular sulfide and which defines the<br>
carbon content affecting the machinability of the free<br>
cutting steel, contains 0.02 to 0.15 mass % of C, 0.05<br>
to 1.8 mass % of Mn, 0.16 to 0.49 mass % of S, 0.002 to<br>
0.010 mass % of 0, 0.3 to 2.3% of Cr, and the balance<br>
consisting of Fe and inevitable impurities, the Cr/S<br>
ratio falling within a range of between 2 and 6.<br>
It is possible for the third free cutting steel of<br>
the present invention to further contain not more than<br>
0.1 mass % of Si, 0.04 to 0.12 mass % of P, and not<br>
more than 0.01 mass % of Al.<br>
It is also possible for the third free cutting<br>
steel of the present invention to further contain at<br>
least one element selected from the group consisting of<br><br>
0.0001 to 0.0090 mass % of Ca, 0.01 to 0.40 mass % of<br>
Pb, 0.02 to 0.30 mass % of Se, 0.03 to 0.15 mass % of<br>
Te, 0.02 to 0.20 mass % of Bi, 0.003 to 0.020 mass % of<br>
Sn, 0.004 to 0.010 mass % of B, 0.005 to 0.015 mass %<br>
of N, 0.05 to 0.50 mass % of Cu, 0.003 to 0.090 mass %<br>
of Ti, 0.005 to 0.200 mass % of V, 0.005 to 0.090<br>
mass % of Zr, and 0.0005 to 0.0080 mass % of Mg.<br>
As a result of an extensive research conducted in<br>
an effort to achieve the third object described above,<br>
the present inventors have found that:<br>
(i) It is possible to allow the free cutting<br>
steel to exhibit the machinability including the chip<br>
disposability and the surface roughness, which is fully<br>
comparable to or higher than that of the conventional<br>
steel, by allowing the sulfide having an aspect ratio<br>
not larger than 5 to occupy at least 80% of the<br>
sulfides having the major axis not smaller than 10 µm<br>
and by allowing the sulfide to be large and to be<br>
formed like a spindle, even if the oxygen content of<br>
the steel is decreased from the level in the<br>
conventional steel.<br>
(ii) As described previously, it is possible to<br>
obtain a suitable amount of a sulfide containing both<br>
Cr and Mn by the addition of suitable amounts of Cr, Mn<br>
and S and by optimizing the Cr/S ratio. Since the<br>
sulfide containing both Cr and Mn suppresses the<br>
elongation in the hot working step, it is possible to<br><br>
obtain the sulfide that is large and formed like a<br>
spindle, as described in item (i) above.<br>
(iii) Since it is possible to decrease the oxygen<br>
content of the steel from the level in the conventional<br>
steel, it is possible to decrease the blow-hole<br>
generated in the casting step, compared with the<br>
conventional steel. Since the decrease of the blow-hole<br>
permits suppressing the generation of the surface flaw<br>
in the rolling step derived from the blow-hole, the<br>
surface flaw of the rolled can be decreased.<br>
(iv) It is known to the art that the<br>
machinability is improved with increase in the S amount<br>
However, there is an upper limit in the S amount<br>
because of the problem in terms of the anisotropy in<br>
the hot workability or the mechanical properties. On<br>
the other hand, if a large and spindle-shaped sulfide<br>
is formed as described above, it is possible to elevate<br>
the upper limit of the S amount. As a result, the<br>
machinability of the free cutting steel including the<br>
chip disposability and the surface roughness can be<br>
markedly improved.<br>
It is possible for the third free cutting steel<br>
described above, which has been obtained on the basis<br>
of the ideas given above, to exhibit a machinability<br>
fully comparable to or higher than that exhibited by<br>
the conventional steel containing substantially the<br>
same amounts of sulfur and lead without obstructing the<br><br>
cost reduction and without lowering the hot ductility<br>
in spite of the oxygen content lower than that in the<br>
conventional steel. Also, since it is possible to lower<br>
the oxygen concentration, it is possible to suppress<br>
the surface flaw in the rolling step, which is derived<br>
from the blow-hole generated in the casting step.<br>
The reasons for defining the composition of the<br>
third free cutting steel as described above will now be<br>
described.<br>
(a)	S: 0.16 to 0.49 mass %<br>
Sulfur is a sulfide formation element which forms<br>
a sulfide effective for improving the machinability of<br>
the steel. However, if the S content is lower than 0.16<br>
mass %, the amount of the sulfide formed is excessively<br>
small, resulting in failure to obtain a sufficient<br>
effect for improving the machinability of the steel. On<br>
the other hand, if the S content exceeds 0.49 mass %,<br>
the hot workability and the ductility of the steel are<br>
markedly lowered. Such being the situation, the S<br>
content of steel is defined in the present invention to<br>
fall within a range of between 0.16 and 0.49 mass %.<br>
(b)	O: 0.002 to 0.010 mass %<br>
Oxygen is an element effective for suppressing the<br>
elongation of the sulfide in the hot working step such<br>
as a rolling step. Therefore, oxygen is an element<br>
important for improving the machinability of the steel<br>
by suppressing the elongation of the sulfide. However,<br><br>
if the 0 content is not higher than 0.002 mass %, it is<br>
difficult to obtain a sufficient effect of suppressing<br>
the elongation of the sulfide. Since the elongated<br>
sulfide remains in the steel, it is impossible to<br>
obtain a sufficient effect of improving the<br>
machinability of the steel. On the other hand, O<br>
permits generating the blow-hole in the casting step,<br>
and the surface flaw is derived from the blow-hole.<br>
Therefore, an excessively high O content is harmful. If<br>
the O content exceeds 0.010 mass %, a large number of<br>
blow-holes are generated and, thus, the surface flaw<br>
tends to be increased in the rolling step. In addition,<br>
the improvement in the effect of suppressing the<br>
elongation of the sulfide is small. Under the<br>
circumstances, the O content is defined in the present<br>
invention to fall within a range of between 0.002<br>
mass % and 0.010 mass %.<br>
(c)	For sulfide having an aspect ratio of 5 or<br>
less to occupy at least 80% of sulfides having major<br>
axis of 10 µm or more:<br>
Concerning the machinability of the steel, it is<br>
advantageous for the sulfide to be large and to be<br>
formed like a spindle. Therefore, it is necessary for<br>
the sulfide having an aspect ratio of 5 or less to<br>
occupy at least 80% of the sulfides having the major<br>
axis of 10 µm or more.<br>
(d)	C: 0.02 to 0.15 mass %<br><br>
If the C content is lower than 0.02 mass %, it is<br>
impossible to obtain a sufficient strength of the steel,<br>
as in the first free cutting steel. On the other hand,<br>
if the C content exceeds 0.15 mass %, the strength of<br>
the steel is rendered excessively high so as to<br>
deteriorate the machinability of the steel. Such being<br>
the situation, the C content is defined in the present<br>
invention to fall within a range of between 0.02 mass %<br>
and 0.15 mass %. Preferably, the C content should fall<br>
within a range of between 0.02 mass % and 0.10 mass %.<br>
(e)	Mn: 0.05 to 1.8 mass %<br>
If the Mn content is lower than 0.05 mass %, the<br>
amount of the sulfide formed is excessively small,<br>
resulting in failure to obtain a sufficient<br>
machinability, as in the first free cutting steel<br>
described previously. On the other hand, if the Mn<br>
content exceeds 1.8 mass %, the formed sulfide is much<br>
elongated, with the result that the machinability of<br>
the steel is lowered. Such being the situation, the Mn<br>
content is defined in the present invention to fall<br>
within a range of between 0.05 and 1.8 mass %.<br>
Preferably, the Mn content should be not lower than<br>
0.22 mass % and lower than 0.60 mass %.<br>
(f)	Cr: 0.3 to 2.3 mass %<br>
If the Cr content is lower than 0.3 mass %, it is<br>
difficult to obtain a sufficient effect of suppressing<br>
the elongation of the sulfide, as in the first free<br><br>
cutting steel described previously. Since the elongated<br>
sulfide remains in the steel, it is impossible to<br>
obtain a sufficient effect of improving the<br>
machinability of the steel. On the other hand, even if<br>
the Cr addition amount exceeds 2.3 mass %, the effect<br>
of suppressing the elongation of the sulfide is<br>
saturated. It follows that the addition of an<br>
excessively large amount of Cr is disadvantageous in<br>
economy. Under the circumstances, the Cr content is<br>
defined in the present invention to fall within a range<br>
of between 0.3 mass % and 2.3 mass %. Preferably, the<br>
Cr content should fall within a range of between 0.3<br>
mass % and 1.5 mass %.<br>
(g) Cr/S ratio: 2 to 6<br>
The Cr/S ratio is important in the third free<br>
cutting steel as in the first and second free cutting<br>
steels. If the Cr/S ratio is smaller than 2, the<br>
sulfide elongated by the formation of MnS is rendered<br>
prominent so as to deteriorate the machinability of the<br>
steel. On the other hand, if the Cr/S ratio exceeds 6,<br>
the effect of suppressing the elongation of the sulfide<br>
is saturated. Such being the situation, the Cr/S ratio<br>
is defined in the present invention to fall within a<br>
range of between 2 and 6. Preferably, the Cr/S ratio<br>
should fall within a range of between 2 and 4.<br>
The other conditions of the third free cutting<br>
steel are as follows:<br><br>
(h) Si: 0.1 mass % or less<br>
As described above, Si shortens the tool life.<br>
Therefore, where it is desired to further prolong the<br>
tool life, it is desirable to define the Si content not<br>
to exceed 0.1 mass %. More desirably, the Si content of<br>
the steel should not exceed 0.03 mass %.<br>
(i) P: 0.04 to 0.12 mass %<br>
If the P content is lower than 0.04 mass %, it is<br>
difficult to produce effectively the effect of<br>
suppressing the formation of the built-up edge in the<br>
cutting process step, resulting in failure to obtain a<br>
sufficient effect of lowering the finish surface<br>
roughness. On the other hand, if the P content exceeds<br>
0.12 mass %, the effect noted above is saturated. Also,<br>
the hot workability and the ductility of the steel are<br>
markedly lowered. Such being the situation, the P<br>
content is defined in the present invention to fall<br>
within a range of between 0.04 mass % and 0.12 mass %.<br>
(j) Al: 0.01 mass % or less<br>
Since Al deteriorates the tool life as described<br>
previously it is desirable to define the Al content not<br>
to exceed 0.01 mass %, where it is desired to further<br>
prolong the tool life. More desirably, the Al content<br>
of the steel should not exceed 0.003 mass %.<br>
(k) At least one of:<br>
Ca: 0.0001 to 0.0090 mass %;<br>
Pb: 0.01 to 0.40 mass %;<br><br>
Se: 0.02 to 0.30 mass %;<br>
Te: 0.03 to 0.15 mass %;<br>
Bi: 0.02 to 0.20 mass %;<br>
Sn: 0.003 to 0.020 mass %;<br>
B: 0.004 to 0.010 mass %;<br>
N: 0.005 to 0.015 mass %;<br>
Cu: 0.05 to 0.50 mass %;<br>
Ti: 0.003 to 0.090 mass %;<br>
V: 0.005 to 0.200 mass %;<br>
Zr: 0.005 to 0.090 mass %;<br>
Mg: 0.0005 to 0.0080 mass %.<br>
Any of Ca, Pb, Se, Te, Bi, Sn, B, N, Cu, Ti, V, Zr<br>
and Mg is used in the case where it is important to<br>
improve the machinability of the steel. However, if the<br>
addition amount of each of these elements is smaller<br>
than the lower limit noted above, the effect of<br>
improving the machinability of the steel cannot be<br>
obtained. On the other hand, where the addition amount<br>
of each of these elements exceeds the upper limit noted<br>
above, the effect of improving the machinability of the<br>
steel is saturated. Also, the addition of an<br>
excessively large amount of each of these elements is<br>
disadvantageous in economy. Under the circumstances, in<br>
the case of adding these elements, these elements<br>
should be added such that Ca falls within a range of<br>
between 0.0001 and 0.0090 mass %, Pb falls within a<br>
range of between 0.01 and 0.40 mass %, Se falls within<br><br>
a range of between 0.02 and 0.30 mass %, Te falls<br>
within a range of between 0.03 and 0.15 mass %, Bi<br>
falls within a range of between 0.02 and 0.20 mass %,<br>
Sn falls within a range of between 0.003 and 0.020<br>
mass %, B falls within a range of between 0.004 and<br>
0.010 mass %, N falls within a range of between 0.005<br>
and 0.015 mass %, Cu falls within a range of between<br>
0.05 and 0.50 mass %, Ti falls within a range of<br>
between 0.003 and 0.090 mass %, V falls within a range<br>
of between 0.005 and 0.200 mass %, Zr falls within a<br>
range of between 0.005 and 0.090 mass %, and Mg falls<br>
within a range of between 0.0005 and 0.0080 mass %.<br>
(1) Micro structure<br>
It is desirable for the micro structure of the<br>
third free cutting steel to be a ferrite • pearlite-based<br>
structure like the first and second free cutting steels.<br>
Concerning the machinability of the steel, it is<br>
advantageous for the prior austenite grain size to be<br>
large. However, a satisfactory machinability can be<br>
maintained even in the case of fine grains. In view of<br>
the mechanical properties of the article, it is<br>
desirable for the grains to be fine such that the grain<br>
size exceeds the grain size number 7.<br>
Incidentally, the manufacturing method of each of<br>
the first to third free cutting steels of the present<br>
invention is not particularly limited. It is possible<br>
to carry out the casting and the hot rolling under the<br><br>
ordinary conditions. The subsequent heat treatment is<br>
not particularly limited, either. For example, it is<br>
possible to employ the ordinary normalizing.<br>
(Examples)<br>
Some Examples of the present invention will now be<br>
described.<br>
First Example:<br>
The first Example is directed to Examples of the<br>
first free cutting steel.<br>
Prepared were steel samples Nos. 1 to 6 each<br>
having a chemical composition falling within the range<br>
of the first free cutting steel of the present<br>
invention (hereinafter referred to as Examples of the<br>
present invention), as shown in Table 1, steel samples<br>
Nos. 7 to 11 each having a chemical composition failing<br>
to fall within the range of the first free cutting<br>
steel of the present invention (hereinafter referred to<br>
as Comparative Examples), and a steel sample No. 12<br>
used as a reference Example and directed to a low<br>
carbon resulfurized and leaded free cutting steel. Each<br>
of these steel samples was smelted and then casted into<br>
an ingot having a cross sectional area of 400 mm x 300<br>
mm, followed by subjecting the ingot to a hot rolling<br>
so as to obtain an 80 mm diameter steel rod. Further,<br>
the steel rod thus obtained was subjected to a<br>
normalizing treatment such that the steel rod was<br>
heated at 9250C for one hour, followed by cooling the<br><br>
heated steel rod to room temperature by means of the<br>
air cooling.<br>
The form of the sulfide of each steel rod thus<br>
manufactured was measured. Also, a test for the<br>
machinability was applied to the steel rod thus<br>
manufactured.<br>
For measuring the form of the sulfide, the major<br>
axis L (length in the rolling direction) and the minor<br>
axis d (thickness or length in a direction<br>
perpendicular to the rolling direction) were measured<br>
by an image analyzing apparatus in respect of all the<br>
sulfides present in a region of 5.5 mm x 11 mm in the<br>
central portion of steel rod. Also, obtained was a<br>
ratio of the sulfides having the major axis not smaller<br>
than 10 µm and a ratio of the sulfides having an aspect<br>
ratio L/d not larger than 5 to all the sulfides having<br>
the major axis not smaller than 10 µm. Further, a<br>
machinability test was conducted under the conditions<br>
shown in Table 2.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Table 3 shows the results. Also, FIG. 2 is a<br>
graph showing the relationship between the life of the<br>
turning tool (SKH4), which is taken up as a typical<br>
characteristic value, and the life of the drilling tool.<br>
As apparent from Table 3, it was confirmed that<br>
any of samples Nos. 1 to 6 of the present invention had<br>
been satisfactory in various characteristics, compared<br>
with the low carbon resulfurized and leaded free<br>
cutting steel for sample No. 12 (Reference Example).<br>
On the other hand, the Mn content exceeded the<br>
upper limit specified in the present invention in<br>
sample No. 7 for the Comparative Example. The Cr<br>
content was lower than the lower limit specified in the<br>
present invention in sample No. 9 for the Comparative<br>
Example. The 0 content was insufficient in sample No.<br>
10 for the Comparative Example. Further, the Cr/S ratio<br>
was lower than the lower limit specified in the present<br>
invention in sample No. 11 for the Comparative Example.<br>
As a result, the aspect ratio of the sulfide was<br>
rendered large in each of these steel samples of the<br>
Comparative Example and, thus, these steel samples were<br>
rendered inferior to the steel samples of the present<br>
invention in the machinability. On the other hand, the<br>
S content of the steel sample No. 8 for the Comparative<br>
Example was lower than the lower limit specified in the<br>
present invention. Therefore, the steel sample No. 8<br>
noted above was insufficient in the total amount of the<br><br>
sulfide effective for improving the machinability of<br>
the steel, with the result that the steel sample No. 8<br>
was inferior in the machinability of the steel to the<br>
steel samples of the present invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
Second Example:<br>
The second Example is directed to the second free<br>
cutting steel of the present invention.<br>
Cast under the conditions equal to those for the<br>
first Example were steel samples Nos. 21 to 26 for the<br>
present invention each having the chemical composition<br>
falling within the range specified for the second free<br>
cutting steel of the present invention as shown in<br>
Table 4, steel samples Nos. 27 to 31 for the<br>
Comparative Example each having a chemical composition<br>
failing to fall within the range specified for the<br>
second free cutting steel of the present invention, and<br>
a steel sample No. 32 for the reference Example<br>
directed to a low carbon resulfurized and leaded free<br>
cutting steel. The cast steel samples were subjected to<br>
a hot rolling and, then, to a normalizing under the<br>
conditions equal to those for the first Example.<br>
The form of the sulfide was measured and a<br>
machinability test was applied as in the first Example<br>
in respect of each of the steel rod samples thus<br>
manufactured and having the compositions as shown in<br><br><br><br><br>
Table 5 shows the results of the test. As<br>
apparent from Table 5, it was confirmed that any of the<br>
steel samples Nos. 21 to 26 for the present invention<br>
had satisfactory characteristics, compared with the<br>
steel sample No. 32 for the reference Example directed<br>
to a low carbon resulfurized and leaded free cutting<br>
steel.<br>
On the other hand, the Mn content of the steel<br>
sample No. 27 for the Comparative Example exceeded the<br>
upper limit specified in the present invention. The Cr<br>
content of the steel sample No. 29 for the Comparative<br>
Example was lower than the lower limit specified in the<br>
present invention. The Cr/S ratio in the steel sample<br>
No. 30 for the Comparative Example was lower than the<br>
lower limit specified in the present invention. Further,<br>
the O content of the steel sample No. 31 for the<br>
Comparative Example was insufficient. As a result, the<br>
aspect ratio of the sulfide was rendered large in each<br>
of these steel samples for the Comparative Example and,<br>
thus, the machinability of each of these steel samples<br>
for the Comparative Example was found to be inferior to<br>
that of any of the steel samples for the present<br>
invention. Further, the S content of the steel sample<br>
No. 28 for the Comparative Example was lower than the<br>
lower limit specified in the present invention. As a<br>
result, the total amount of the sulfides effective for<br>
improving the machinability of the steel was<br><br>
insufficient and, thus, the steel sample No. 28 was<br>
inferior in the machinability to any of the steel<br>
samples for the present invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
Third Example;<br>
The third Example is directed to the third free<br>
cutting steel of the present invention.<br>
Cast under the conditions equal to those for the<br>
first Example were steel samples Nos. 41 to 46 for the<br>
present invention each having the chemical composition<br>
falling within the range specified for the third free<br>
cutting steel of the present invention as shown in<br>
Table 6, steel samples Nos. 47 to 51 for the<br>
Comparative Example each having a chemical composition<br>
failing to fall within the range specified for the<br>
third free cutting steel of the present invention, and<br>
a steel sample No. 52 for the reference Example<br>
directed to JIS SUM23L. The cast steel samples were<br>
subjected to a hot rolling and, then, to a normalizing<br>
under the conditions equal to those for the first<br>
Example.<br>
The form of the sulfide was measured and a<br>
machinability test was applied as in the first Example<br>
in respect of each of the steel rod samples thus<br>
manufactured and having the compositions as shown in<br><br><br><br><br>
Table 7 shows the results of the test. As<br>
apparent from Table 7, each of steel samples Nos. 41 to<br>
44 included in the steel samples of the present<br>
invention was found to have satisfactory<br>
characteristics, compared with the steel sample No. 52<br>
for the reference Example directed to JIS SUM23L. Also,<br>
the steel sample No. 45 for the present invention,<br>
which is equal in the S content to and a half in the 0<br>
content of the steel sample No. 52 for the reference<br>
Example directed to JIS SUM23L, was found to be<br>
substantially equal in the machinability to the steel<br>
sample No. 52 (JIS SUM23L). In addition, a surface flaw<br>
was scarcely found in the steel sample No. 45 for the<br>
present invention. Further, the steel sample No. 46 for<br>
the present invention, which had a S content equal to<br>
that of the steel sample No. 52 for the reference<br>
Example directed to JIS SUM23L and had an 0 content<br>
lower than that of the steel sample NO. 52 noted above<br>
and higher than that of the steel sample NO. 45 for the<br>
present invention, was found to be satisfactory in the<br>
machinability, compared with the steel sample No. 52.<br>
On the other hand, the Mn content of the steel<br>
sample No. 47 for the Comparative Example exceeded the<br>
upper limited specified in the present invention. The<br>
Cr content of the steel sample No. 49 for the<br>
Comparative Example was lower than the lower limit<br>
specified in the present invention. Further, the Cr/S<br><br>
ratio of the steel sample 51 for the Comparative<br>
Example was lower than the lower limit specified in the<br>
present invention. As a result, the sulfide in each of<br>
these steel samples for the Comparative Examples had a<br>
large aspect ratio and, thus, each of these steel<br>
samples was found to be inferior in machinability to<br>
any of the steel samples of the present invention.<br>
Further, the S content of the steel sample No. 48 for<br>
the Comparative Example was lower than the lower limit<br>
specified in the present invention. Therefore, the<br>
steel sample No. 48 for the Comparative Example was<br>
insufficient in the total amount of the sulfides<br>
effective for improving the machinability of the steel<br>
and, thus, was also inferior in the machinability to<br>
any of the steel samples of the present invention.<br>
Still further, the O content of the steel sample No. 50<br>
for the Comparative Example was lower than the lower<br>
limit specified in the present invention and, thus, the<br>
steel sample No. 50 was inferior in the machinability<br>
to any of the steel samples of the present invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
