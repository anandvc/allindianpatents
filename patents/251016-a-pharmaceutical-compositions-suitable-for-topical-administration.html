				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION <br>
The present, inventive subject matter relates to pharmaceutical . compositions suitable for topical administration comprising two active ingredients, a hydroxycarboxylic acid and prednicarbate, and a pyrrolidone carboxylate salt moisturizing agent. In a â€¢ particular aspect, the two active ingredients in the present inventive compositions have a purity of at least 90% and a concentration of degradation product(s) less than about 10% of the starting concentration of the active ingredients. These compositions are used for topical medical applications, particularly to treat steroid responsive dermatoses.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Topical medications that include corticosteroids are known in the art as useful for treating skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and other pathologies of the skin. Current steroid-containing products are available mainly as gels, lotions or ointments that are supplied in tubes or bottles and applied to an affected area of the skin by hand.<br>
However, the results of using corticosteroids in topical treatment of, for example, psoriasis have been variable and unpredictable. In some cases topical corticosteroids seemed to improve and eradicate the psoriatic lesions, but in other cases corticosteroids appeared to be ineffective on topical administration. Drug resistance and rebound worsening are also common features when corticosteriods alone are used in the treatment of psoriasis. Accordingly, it is often required to use corticosteroids in combination with another ingredient that stabilizes and enhances the activity of the corticosteroid.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,879,537 describes the use of certain a-hydroxy acids, a-keto acids, and related compounds for topical treatment of fish-scale like ichthyotic conditions in humans.<br>
Similarly, U.S. Patent No. 3,920,835 describes the use of these certain a-hydroxy acids, a-keto acids, and their derivatives for topical treatment of dandruff, acne, and palmar and plantar hyperkeratosis. a-hydroxy acids and a-keto acids, then, were also well known in the art as having dermatological effects.<br>
In view of these prior teachings, U.S. Patent No. 4,246,261 discloses that hydroxy acids and related compounds greatly enhance the therapeutic efficacy of corticosteroids in the topical treatment of such<br>
dermatological disorders as psoriasis, eczema, seborrheic dermatitis, and other inflammatory skin conditions.<br>
A number of products have entered the marketplace taking advantage of this hydroxy acid-corticosteroid combination. For example, the Lacticare-HC Lotion product (Stiefel Laboratories/ Inc., Coral Gables, FL) contains a combination of hydrocortisone and lactic acid. This product has been well known for use in the treatment of, for example, pruritis.<br>
Numerous other similar products have entered the marketplace containing a combination of hydroxy acids such as lactic acid and a corticosteroid such as hydrocortisone. The majority of these products, however, contain hydrocortisone as the steroidal active ingredient.<br>
Excessive use of hydrocortisone is well-known to exhibit a variety of undesired side effects, including blurred vision, halos around lights, an irregular heartbeat, insomnia, mood changes, weight gain, fatigue, redness, blistering, burning, itching, peeling, thinning of the skin, and stretch marks. Additionally, it is well known that children are especially sensitive to the unwanted side effects of topically administered hydrocortisone. Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for topical corticosteroid products containing a steroid other than hydrocortisone, especially for the<br>
treatment of children.<br>
Several such topical products containing a steroid other than hydrocortisone have been sold.  However, none of these teach or suggest the use of a moisturizing agent which may aid in the therapeutic effects  and patient compliance with these compositions.   As shown by U.S. Patent No. 5,874,974 it is desirable to include an agent having  a  moisturizing  or  emollient  effect  with  a composition  containing  a  steroid  to  supplement  the curative action of the steroid and to enhance the effect of the steroid on the skin.<br>
One deficiency of the prior art topical steroid compositions is the lack of recognition for maintaining a high purity level of the active drugs with a low amount of degradates. This deficiency is overcome with the present formulations which not only contain three essential components but also require a high drug purity and low drug degradates, which increases the effectiveness and shelf-life of the topical composition.<br>
Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for topical  steroidal  compositions  useful  in  treating  a variety  of  dermatological  disorders  that  contain  a steroid other than hydrocortisone, a second ingredient, such as a hydroxy acid, to stabilize and enhance the activity of the steroid, and a moisturizing agent to supplement the curative activity of the steroid.  There<br>
further remains a need for such topical compositions that maintain a high purity level of the active drug(s) and a low level of degradates thereof. The present inventive subject matter addresses these needs.<br>

Other terms as used herein are meant to be defined by their well-known meanings in the art.<br>
Topical Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
The present inventive subject matter pertains to a pharmaceutical composition suitable for topical administration comprising:<br>
about 1 to about 30% by weight of an a-hydroxy acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof having a purity of at least 90% and a concentration of degradation product (s) less than about 10% of the starting concentration of said a-hydroxy acid;<br>
about 0.05 to about 2.0% by weight of prednicarbate or -a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof having a purity of at least 90% and a concentration of degradation product (s) less than about 10% of the starting concentration of said prednicarbate; and<br>
about 0.5 to about 10% by weight of a pyrrolidone<br>
*<br>
carboxylate salt.<br>
The present inventive pharmaceutical compositions suitable for topical administration contain two active ingredients: an a-hydroxy acid and prednicarbate. The presence of these two different active ingredients conveys a synergistic, or a greater than additive, effect upon application of the present inventive compositions to<br>
the skin. That is, the present inventive compositions containing both of these active ingredients produce a greater medical effect than would be exhibited by adding the medical effects of an a-hydroxy acid and prednicarbate applied to the same skin separately.<br>
Additionally, the present inventive pharmaceutical compositions contain a moisturizing agent, preferably a pyrrolidone carboxylate salt moisturizing agent. This moisturizing agent acts to further enhance the effect's and curative action of the prednicarbate on the skin. Further, the moisturizing agent moisturizes the skin, avoiding normal side effects of corticosteroid use such as drying, redness, blistering, burning, itching, and peeling of the skin. Accordingly, the addition of the moisturizing agent to the present compositions will improve patient compliance with a prescribed treatment regimen.<br>
The present inventive compositions are preferably<br>
formed as an oil-in-water emulsion,  i.e.  an emulsion<br>
â€¢ having an oil phase and an aqueous phase.  Preferably,<br>
the oil phase of the emulsion comprises an oily material and an emulsifier to aid in formation of the emulsion. More preferably, the oil phase contains at least two emulsifiers.<br>
The first active ingredient, a-hydroxy acid or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is preferably<br>
contained in the aqueous phase of the emulsion. The aqueous phase additionally preferably contains the moisturizing agent of the present inventive compositions, i.e. the pyrrolidone carboxylate salt. The pH of this aqueous phase, if required, is adjusted to a range of about 3.0 to about 6.0 before it is combined with the oil phase to form the emulsion. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the pH of the aqueous phase is adjusted to a pH range of about 4.0 to about 5.0.<br>
Once the oil phase and the aqueous phase are combined to form the emulsion, the second active ingredient, prednicarbate or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is solubilized in a suitable solvent and dispersed throughout the emulsion.<br>
â€¢ Since the emulsion is an oil-in-water emulsion having water as the major component, the final composition will have a pH mirroring that of the aqueous phase. Accordingly, the pH of the final composition preferably ranges from about 3.0 to about 6.0. In a<br>
*<br>
particularly preferred embodiment, the pH of the final composition ranges from about 4.0 to about 5.0.<br>
These particular emulsion and pH characteristics convey to the present compositions the unique advantages of being able to maintain a high purity level and a low concentration of degradation- products of the active ingredients. The high purity level and low concentration<br>
of degradation products permits the present inventive compositions to have a longer shelf life and increased pharmaceutical effectiveness when compared with other corticosteroid products previously known in the art.<br>
In this regard, the present inventive compositions maintain a purity level of at least 90%, preferably at least 92.5%, more preferably at least 95% of each of the active ingredients over an extended period of time.<br>
Likewise, the present inventive compositions are able to maintain a low concentration of degradation product(s) of the active ingredients over an extended period of time. In this regard, the present compositions will maintain a concentration of degradation product(s) less than about 10%, preferably less than about 7.5%, more preferably less than about 5% of the starting concentration of each of the active ingredients. These advantageous properties were previously unknown in the prior art compositions.<br>
g-Hydroxy Acids<br>
The present inventive compositions preferably contain about 1 to about 30% by weight of an a-hydroxy acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as a first active ingredient. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the present inventive compositions contain about 1 to about 10% by weight of the a-hydroxy acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In a most<br>
preferred embodiment, the present inventive compositions contain about 3 to about 7% by weight of the a-hydroxy acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>

branched chain or cyclic form, having 1 to 25 carbon<br>
atoms.  In addition Ra and Rb may each carry one or more<br>
' OH,  CHO,  COOH, or alkoxy groups having 1 to 9 carbon<br>
' atoms.  The a-hydroxy acids may exist as stereoisomers as<br>

In a particularly preferred embodiment, the present inventive compositions contain about 0.1 to about 1.0% by weight of the prednicarbate or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In a most preferred embodiment, the present inventive compositions contain about 0.15 to about 0.5% by weight of the prednicarbate or a pharmaceutically<br><br>
acceptable salt thereof.<br>
It is an essential aspect for the present inventive compositions to maintain a purity level of at least 90%, preferably at least 92.5%, more preferably at least 95% of the prednicarbate over an extended period of time. Likewise, the present inventive compositions are able to maintain a low concentration of degradation product(s) of the prednicarbate, e.g. less than about 10%, preferably less than about 7.5%, more preferably less than about 5% of the starting concentration of the prednicarbate, over an extended period of time.<br>
Prednicarbate is especially useful in the present inventive compositions since children and those having sensitive skin more easily tolerate it than other known steroids, such as hydrocortisone. Accordingly, by virtue of the presence of prednicarbate rather than hydrocortisone, the present inventive compositions permit a greater frequency of administration and a greater amount of drug to be delivered to children and those with sensitive skin.<br>
However, it is further contemplated as within the scope of the presently claimed invention that another steroid may be used as a substitute for the prednicarbate so long as the other steroid maintains a purity level of at least 90% and a concentration of degradation product(s) less than about 10% over an extended period of<br><br>
time. Additionally, the other steroid must be easier tolerated by children and those with sensitive skin than is hydrocortisone.<br>

The addition of the moisturizing agent to the present inventive pharmaceutical compositions enhances the effects and curative action of the prednicarbate on the skin. Further, the moisturizing agent moisturizes the skin, avoiding normal side effects of corticosteroid use such as drying, redness, blistering, burning, itching, and peeling of the skin. Accordingly, the addition of the moisturizing agent to the present compositions will improve patient compliance with a prescribed treatment regimen.<br>

Methods of Production<br>
The present inventive subject matter further relates to a process for preparing a pharmaceutical composition suitable for topical administration comprising an emulsion, said process comprising:<br>
1)	preparing an oil phase comprising an oily material<br>
selected from the group consisting of mineral oil,<br>
petrolatum,  petroleum derivatives,  fatty acids,<br>
fatty acid derivatives,  fatty alcohols,  fatty<br>
alcohol  derivatives,  paraffins,  and  mixtures<br>
thereof and at least two emulsifiers;<br>
2)	preparing an aqueous phase comprising an a-hydroxy<br>
acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof<br>
having  a  purity  of  at  least  90%  and  a<br>
concentration of degradation product (s) less than about 10% of the starting concentration of said a-hydroxy acid and a pyrrolidone carboxylate salt;<br>
3)	adjusting the pH of said aqueous phase to a range<br>
of about 3.0 to about 6.0.<br>
4)	adding said oil phase to said aqueous phase while<br>
mixing at a temperature of about 55 to about 85 Â°C<br>
to obtain a homogenous emulsion;<br>
5)	cooling said emulsion to a temperature of about 25<br>
to about 45 Â°C;<br>
6)	solubilizing prednicarbate or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt thereof having a purity of at<br>
least  90%  and a  concentration of  degradation<br>
product (s) less than about 10% of the starting<br>
concentration of said prednicarbate in a lower<br>
alkyl alcohol and dispersing said prednicarbate<br>
throughout said emulsion; and<br>
7)	recovering  a  topical  emulsion  pharmaceutical<br>
composition.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present inventive subject matter, the oil phase is prepared by mixing an oily material and at least two emulsifiers at a temperature of about 55 to about 85 Â°C. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the oil phase is prepared by further mixing a thickening agent, an emollient, and a preservative with the oily material and<br>
the at least two emulsifiers.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present inventive subject matter, the aqueous phase is prepared by first mixing a preservative followed by a polymer thickening agent in purified water at a temperature of about 55 to about 85 Â°C before adding an a-hydroxy acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a pyrrolidone carboxylate salt. Once these ingredients are mixed, a pH modifier is added to the aqueous phase to ensure a pH of about 3.0 to about 6.0, preferably about 4.0 to about 5.0. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the pH is adjusted by adding sodium hydroxide to the aqueous phase. This pH represents the final pH of the composition. It is necessary to adjust the pH of the aqueous phase before addition of the oil phase to ensure that the oil phase does not intermingle with the aqueous phase, destroying the emulsion, during addition of the pH modifier.<br>
In a particularly key aspect of the present inventive process, the emulsion is cooled from a temperature of about 55 to about 85 Â°C to a temperature of about 25 to about 45.Â°C before the prednicarbate is dispersed therein. This cooling step is particularly important because a substantial amount of prednicarbate degradation products will form at temperatures above 63 Â°C. Accordingly, it is necessary to cool the emulsion<br>
before adding the prednicarbate to maintain the high prednicarbate purity and low amount of prednicarbate degradation products essential to the present inventive compositions.<br>
Further contemplated as within the scope of the present inventive subject matter are pharmaceutical compositions produced according to the above-described process, wherein the a-hydroxy acid and the prednicarbate in said compositions each maintain a purity of at least 90% and a concentration of degradation product(s) less than about 10% of the starting concentration of the a-hydroxy acid and the prednicarbate. If produced according to the present inventive process, these compositions exhibit chemical and physical stability suitable for topical administration.<br>
The compositions produced according to these processes can further be used in a lotion, cream, ointment, shampoo, or other pharmaceutically acceptable topical dosage form. These compositions can be placed in a suitable containment vessel comprising a product contact surface composed of a material selected from the group consisting of glass, plastic, steel, stainless steel, aluminum, Teflon, polymeric structure, ceramic structure, alloys, and mixtures thereof. These containment vessels are used to facilitate manufacturing, handling, processing, packaging, storage, and<br><br>
administration of said composition.<br>
Dosage<br>
Appropriate dosage levels for the active agents contemplated in the present inventive subject matter are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Dosage levels on the order of about 0.001 mg to about 5,000 mg per kilogram body weight of the active therapeutic compounds or compositions are known to be useful in the treatment of the diseases, disorders, and conditions contemplated in the present invention. Typically, this effective amount of the active therapeutic agents will generally comprise from about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg per kilogram of patient body weight per day. Moreover, it will be understood that this dosage of active therapeutic agents can be administered in a single or multiple dosage units to provide the desired therapeutic effect. If desired, other therapeutic agents can be employed in conjunction with those provided by the present inventive subject matter.<br>
As previously discussed, excessive use of hydrocortisone is well-known to exhibit a variety of undesired side effects, including redness, blistering, peeling, thinning of the skin, and stretch marks. These hydrocortisone side effects are especially pronounced in children and those having sensitive skin. The present inventive compositions solve these art-recognized<br>
problems since they contain the steroid prednicarbate, which is more easily tolerated by children and those having sensitive skin, rather than hydrocortisone. Accordingly, the present inventive compositions are especially formulated for pediatric use and for administration to sensitive skin. The present inventive compositions permit a greater frequency of administration and a greater amount of drug to be delivered to children and those with sensitive skin due to inclusion of the steroid prednicarbate rather than hydrocortisone.<br>
The present inventive compositions may be given in a single or multiple doses daily. In a preferred embodiment, the present inventive compositions are given from one to three times daily. Starting with a low dose twice daily and slowly working up to higher doses if needed is a preferred strategy. The amount of active ingredients that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated, the nature of the disease, disorder, or condition, and the nature of the active ingredients.<br>
It is understood, however, that a specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors well known in the art, including the activity of the specific compound employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the<br>
time of administration; the rate of excretion; drug combination; the severity of the particular disorder being treated; and the form of administration. One of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate the variability of such factors and would be able to establish specific dose levels using no more than routine experimentation.<br>
The optimal pharmaceutical formulations will be determined by one skilled in the art depending upon considerations such as the particular drug or drug combination and the desired dosage. See, for example, "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences", 18th ed. (1990, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA 18042), pp. 1435-1712, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Such formulations may influence the physical state, stability, rate of in vivo release, and rate of in vivo clearance of the therapeutic agents.<br>
