				<td>ORAL CARE COMPOSITION WITH CROSS-LINKED POLYMER PEROXIDE<br>
INTRODUCTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to oral care compositions and methods. In particular, the present invention includes compositions and methods for whitening of teeth.<br>
[0002] Many individuals desire a "bright" smile and white teeth, and consider dull and stained teeth cosmetically unattractive. Unfortunately, without preventive or remedial measures, stained teeth are almost inevitable due to the absorbent nature of dental material. Everyday activities such as smoking or other oral use of tobacco products, and eating, chewing or drinking certain foods and beverages (in particular coffee, tea and red wine), cause undesirable staining of surfaces of teeth. Staining can also result from microbial activity, including that associated with dental plaque. The chromogens or color causing substances in these materials become part of the pellicle layer and can permeate the enamel layer. Even with regular brushing and flossing, years of chromogen accumulation can impart noticeable tooth discoloration.<br>
[0003] A tooth is comprised of an inner dentin layer and an outer hard enamel layer that is the protective layer of the tooth. The enamel layer of a tooth is naturally opaque, and white or a slightly off-white color. The enamel layer is composed of hydroxyapatite mineral crystals that create a somewhat porous surface. These hydroxyapatite crystals form microscopic hexagonal rods or prisms that make up the enamel surface. As a result, the surface of the enamel presents microscopic spaces or pores between the prisms. Without limiting the mechanism, function or utility of present invention, it is believed that this porous<br><br>
nature of the enamel is where discoloring substances permeate the enamel and discolor the teeth.<br>
[0004] There are a variety of compositions described in the art for preventing or treating the discoloration of teeth. In particular, to combat staining and brighten or restore the natural enamel color, a variety of products containing bleaching materials are commercially available for professional and consumer use. The most commonly accepted chemicals used in teeth whitening today are peroxides. Peroxides are generally deemed safe from a physiological standpoint, and can be effective to whiten teeth. Such peroxides include hydrogen peroxide, carbamide peroxide, sodium perborate, and sodium percarbonate. When these peroxides are in appropriate contact with teeth they will usually oxidize stains, rendering the teeth whiter.<br>
[0005] Professional dental treatments frequently include a tooth surface preparation such as acid etching followed by the application of highly concentrated bleaching solutions (e.g., up to 37% hydrogen peroxide) and/or the application of heat or light. (See, e.g., U.S. Patents 5,425,953 and 5,766,574.) These procedures provide rapid results, but are expensive, and often require several trips to the dentist. In many cases, the patient's lips are uncomfortably retracted during the entire treatment and the patient is confined to sitting in the dental chair.<br>
[0006] Alternatively, at home bleaching systems can be used. These systems have gained significant popularity in the past decade because of reduced cost, and increased convenience. Instead of time consuming and frequent trips to the dentist, the tooth whitener is purchased at a consumer retail store and may be used while performing other personal tasks or errands, relaxing or sleeping.<br><br>
[0007] Current home treatment methods include abrasive toothpastes, toothpastes that produce oxides, whitening gels for use with a dental tray and whitening strips. The effectiveness of such techniques depends on a variety of factors including the type and intensity of the stain, the type of bleaching agent, contact time of the bleaching agent on the teeth, the amount of available bleaching aqtive in the composition, the ability of the bleaching agent to penetrate the tooth enamel, and consumer compliance. Effectiveness is also dependant on the amount of bleaching active in the composition, the ability of the active to be released during use, and the stability of the active in the product. However, the effectiveness of many of these treatments is adversely affected because of deficiencies in one or more factors relating to the composition and consumer compliance.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0008] The present invention provides oral care compositions. Embodiments include oral care compositions comprising:<br>
(a)	a peroxide complex comprising a peroxide component and an N-vinyl<br>
heterocyclic polymer;<br>
(b)	a whitening agent; and<br>
(c)	an orally acceptable carrier.<br>
In various embodiments, the N-vinyl heterocyclic polymer comprises a polymer selected from the group consisting of poly-N-vinyl polylactams, poly-N-vinyl-polyimides and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the carrier comprises a film forming material. In one embodiment, the carrier comprises a silicone adhesive. In one embodiment, the whitening agent is a peroxide compound.<br><br>
[0009] Methods are also provided for making an oral care composition comprising:<br>
(a)	mixing a whitening agent, silicone adhesive and carrier fluid to form a<br>
homogenous mixture;<br>
(b)	adding a peroxide complex to said homogenous mixture, wherein said<br>
complex comprises hydrogen peroxide and an N-vinyl heterocyclic polymer;<br>
and<br>
(c)	mixing under vacuum.<br>
Methods are also provided for whitening a tooth surface, comprising applying a composition comprising a safe and effective amount of a peroxide complex and a whitening agent.<br>
[0010] It has been discovered that compositions and methods of this invention afford advantages over oral care compositions among known in the art, including one or more of enhanced whitening efficacy, providing a higher available concentration of bleaching agent, tooth adherence in the presence of saliva without the use of a dental tray, and release of the bleaching agent over a period of time. Further uses, benefits and embodiments of the present invention are apparent from the description set forth herein.<br>

Compositions<br>
[0017] The present invention provides oral care compositions and methods for administration or application to, or use with, a human or other animal subject. As referred to herein, an "oral care composition" is any composition that is suitable for administration or application to the oral cavity a human or animal subject for enhancing the health, hygiene or appearance of the subject, preferably providing such benefits as: the prevention or treatment of a condition or disorder of the teeth, gums, mucosa or other hard or soft tissue of the oral cavity; the prevention or treatment of a systemic condition or disorder; the provision of<br><br>
sensory, decorative or cosmetic benefits; and combinations thereof. In various preferred embodiments, an oral care composition is not intentionally swallowed, but is rather retained in the oral cavity for a time sufficient to effect the intended utility. Preferably, specific materials and compositions to be used in this invention are, accordingly, pharmaceutically- or cosmetically-acceptable. As used herein, such a "pharmaceutically acceptable" or "cosmetically acceptable" component is one that is suitable for use with humans and/or animals to provide the desired therapeutic, prophylactic, sensory, decorative, or cosmetic benefit without undue adverse side effects (such as toxicity, irritation, and allergic response) commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.<br>
Peroxide Complex:<br>
[0018] The present invention provides compositions comprising a peroxide complex. The peroxide complex is preferably present at a level of from about 0.5% to about 40%, optionally from about 20% to about 30%. In a preferred embodiment, the concentration of the peroxide complex is such that the peroxide component of the peroxide complex is present at a level of about 10% of the total composition weight, optionally from about 1% to about 6% of the total composition weight.<br>
[0019] The peroxide complex comprises a peroxide component and a porous cross-linked polymer. As referred to herein, a "peroxide component" is any oxidizing compound comprising a bivalent oxygen-oxygen group. Peroxide components include peroxides and hydroperoxides, such as hydrogen peroxide, peroxides of alkali and alkaline earth metals, organic peroxy compounds, peroxy acids, pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof, and mixtures thereof. Peroxides of alkali and alkaline earth metals include lithium<br><br>
peroxide, potassium peroxide, sodium peroxide, magnesium peroxide, calcium peroxide, barium peroxide, and mixtures thereof. Organic peroxy compounds include carbamide peroxide (also known as urea hydrogen peroxide), glyceryl hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydrogen peroxides, dialkyl peroxides, alkyl peroxy acids, peroxy esters, diacyl peroxides, benzoyl peroxide, and monoperoxyphthalate, and mixtures thereof. Peroxy acids and their salts include organic peroxy acids such as alkyl peroxy acids, and monoperoxyphthalate and mixtures thereof, as well as inorganic peroxy acid salts such as percarbonate and perborate salts of alkali and alkaline earth metals such as lithium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium and barium, and mixtures thereof. In various embodiments, the peroxide component comprises hydrogen peroxide, urea peroxide, sodium percarbonate and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the peroxide component comprises hydrogen peroxide. In one embodiment, the peroxide component consists essentially of hydrogen peroxide.<br>
[0020] The peroxide complex also comprises an N-vinyl heterocyclic polymer. Preferably, the polymer is crosslinked and adsorbs, absorbs, complexes, or otherwise retains the peroxide component. The chemical and physical characteristics of the particulate hinder the release of the peroxide compound from the polymer particulates, and in some embodiments provides controlled release of the peroxide compound. The peroxide complex preferably comprises a peroxide component at a level of from about 0.1% to about 25%, optionally from about 1% to about 25%, optionally from about 5% to about 18% by weight of the peroxide composite. In one embodiment, the composition comprises commercially available complex of peroxide adsorbed to cross-linked polyvinylpyrrollidone. Such products include, for example, Peroxydone XL-10 and Peroxydone K-30, marketed by ISP Corporation, Wayne, New Jersey, USA.<br><br>
[0021] The N-vinyl heterocyclic polymer is derived from a N-heterocyclic vinyl monomer, preferably comprising N-vinyl heterocyclic monomers having from 3 to 7 atoms in a heterocyclic ring, including a carbonyl carbon atom and a nitrogen heteroatom containing a vinyl group. Preferably the ring contains 5 or 6 atoms, comprises heteroatoms such as sulfur or oxygen, and may be substituted or unsubstituted..<br>
[0022] Certain embodiments are the polymers of specific N-vinyl heterocyclic monomers such as N-vinyl imides to form poly-N-vinyl polyimides, and N-vinyl lactams to form poly-N-vinyl polylactams, and mixtures thereof. Suitable N-vinyl imides include: N-vinyl malonimide; N-vinyl succinimide; N-vinyl glutarimide; N-vinyl maleimide; N-vinyl jS-methylglutarimide; N-vinyl oamylsuccinimide; and N-vinyl adipimide.<br>
[0023] Suitable N-vinyl lactams include: N-vinyl peperidone; N-vinyl caprolactam; N-vinyl-3-methyl pyrrolidinone or piperidone, or caprolactam; N-vinyl-4-methyl pyrrolidinone, or piperidone or caprolactam; N-vinyl-5-methyl pyrrolidinone or piperidone; N-vinyl-3-ethyl pyrrolidinone; N-vinyl-4,5-dimethyl pyrrolidinone; N-vinyl-5,5-dimethyl pyrrolidinone; N-vinyl-3,3,5-trimethyl pyrrolidinone; N-vinyl-5-methyl-5-ethyl pyrrolidinone; N-vinyl-3,4,5-trimethyl-3-ethyl pyrrolidinone; N-vinyl-6-methyl-2-piperidone; N-vinyl-6-ethyl-2-piperidone; N-vinyl-3,5-dimethyl-2-piperidone; N-vinyl-4,4-dimethyl-2-piperidone; N-vinyl-7-methyl caprolactam; N-vinyl-7-ethyl caprolactam; N-vinyl-3,5-dimethyl caprolactam; N-vinyl-4,6-dimethyl caprolactam; N-vinyl-3,5,7-trimethyl caprolactam.<br>
[0024] Embodiments containing poly-N-vinyl polylactams, include but are not limited to poly-N-vinyl pyrrolidone, poly-N-vinyl-2-piperidone, poly-N-vinyl-2-caprolactam, poly-N-vinyl-3-methyl-2-caprolacam, poly-N-vinyl-3-methyl-2-piperidone,<br><br>
poly-N-vinyl-4-methyl-2-piperidone, poly-N-vinyl-4-methyl-2-caprolactam, poly-N-vinyl-3 -ethyl-2-pyrrolidone, poly-N-vinyl-4,5-dimethyl-2-pyrrolidone, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the polymer is selected from the group consisting of poly-N-vinyl poly-2-pyrrolidone, poly-N-vinyl-poly-2-piperidone, poly-N-vinyl-poly-2-caprolactam and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0025] In a preferred embodiment, the polymer is poly-N-vinyl-poly-2-pyrrolidone. The poly-N-vinyl-poly-2-pyrrolidone is also commonly known as polyvinylpyrrolidone or "PVP". PVP refers to a polymer containing vinylpyrrolidone (also referred to as N-vinylpyrrolidone, N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidione and N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidinone) as a monomeric unit. The monomeric unit, consists of a polar imide group, four non-polar methylene groups and a non-polar methane group. The polymers include soluble and insoluble homopolymeric PVPs. Copolymers containing PVP include vinylpyrrolidone/vinyl acetate (also known as Copolyvidone, Copolyvidonum or VP-VAc) and vinylpyrrolidone/dimethylamino-ethylmethacrylate.<br>
[0026] Soluble PW polymers among those useful herein are known in the art, including Povidone, Polyvidone, Polyvidonum, poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidinone), poly (N-vinylbutyrolactam), poly(l-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) and poly [l-(2-oxo-lpyrrolidinyl)ethylene]. These PVP polymers are not substantially cross-linked.<br>
[0027] In various embodiments of this invention, an insoluble cross-linked homopolymer is preferred. Such polymers include those commonly referred to in the art as polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, cross-povidone, and cPVP, and are referred to herein as "cPVP." The homopolymer is prepared by free radical polymerization of the monomer vinylpyrollidone.<br><br>
[0028] In one embodiment, the poly-N-vinyl-poly-2-pyrrolidone has.a lactam of the pyrrolidone ring that provides the hydrophilic characteristics. Without limiting the composition, mechanism, or function the invention, it is believed that such groups allow the peroxide compound to bind to the cPVP. The hydrophobic characteristics attributed to the methylene groups in the ring and the linear aliphatic backbone prevent the peroxide complex from reacting with saliva while still maintaining the peroxide available to whiten the teeth. The surface characteristic of the cPVP serve as a barrier to the passage of the peroxide component and prevents the premature distribution of the peroxide component upon application of the oral care composition to the oral cavity. The cPVP linked peroxide is released over a period of time through diffusion, temperature variance, moisture levels and other factors.<br>
[0029] Polymer particulates useful herein may be made by well established processes. The poly-N-vinyl polylactams are produced by polymerizing a vinyl lactam in the presence of an alkaline catalyst. (See, U.S. Patents 2,938,017, Grosser, et al, issued May 24, 1960; 3,277,066, Grosser, et al, issued October 4, 1966, and 3,306,886, Grosser, et al, issued February 28, 1967). Embodiments containing poly-N-vinyl polyimides are produced by heating an N-vinyl imide in the presence of a catalyst. (See, U.S. Patent No. 3,306,881, Grosser, et al, issued February 28, 1967). In alternative embodiments comprising a co-polymer of the N-vinyl heterocyclic compound is produced by polymerizing N-vinyl heterocyclic and dissimilar vinyl monomers. (See U.S. Patent Nos. 2,667,473, Morner, et al, issued January 26, 1954; and 2,947,633, Perry et al, issued August 2,1960).<br>
[0030J Porous cross-linked polymers among those useful herein include those commercially available as: Kollidon® and Luvicross®, marketed by BASF, Mount Olive,<br><br>
New Jersey, USA; PVP K-Series or Povidone K-30 marketed by AAA International Corp., Downers Grove, IL, USA; PVP K-30 USP24 and industry grade, PVP VA-64, PVP K-17 and PVP K-90, marketed by Peakchem, Hangzhou, China; and PolyPlasdone® INF-10, marketed by ISP Corporation, Wayne, New Jersey, USA. It is understood that embodiments of the invention are not limited to a PVP of a specific molecular weight and that any equivalent PVP of acceptable purity, preferably pharmaceutical grade, is within the scope of embodiments of this invention.<br>
[0031] In various embodiments, the peroxide complex is made by suspending the polymer (preferably cPVP) in a suitable anhydrous organic solvent. An anhydrous solution of the peroxide component is made, preferably utilizing the same organic solvent as the PVP suspension. The peroxide solution is combined with the PVP suspension in an amount corresponding to the desired molar ratio of polymer peroxide of the peroxide complex. (See, U.S. Patents 5,108,742, Merianos, issued April 28, 1992; and 4,564,514, Druiaz, et al, issued January 14, 1986.) In one embodiment, the peroxide complex has an equal (1:1) molar ratio of hydrogen peroxide to the polymer.<br>
Whitening Agent<br>
[0032] In various embodiments, the compositions of the present invention comprise a whitening agent. As further discussed below, a "whitening agent" is a material which is effective to effect whitening of a tooth surface to which it is applied. In various embodiments, the compositions of this invention comprise a peroxide whitening agent, comprising a peroxide compound. As referred to herein, a "peroxide compound" is an oxidizing compound comprising a bivalent oxygen-oxygen group. Peroxide compounds<br><br>
include peroxides and hydroperoxides, such as hydrogen peroxide, peroxides of alkali and alkaline earth metals, organic peroxy compounds, peroxy acids, pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof, and mixtures thereof. Peroxides of alkali and alkaline earth metals include lithium peroxide, potassium peroxide, sodium peroxide, magnesium peroxide, calcium peroxide, barium peroxide, and mixtures thereof. Organic peroxy compounds include carbamide peroxide (also known as urea hydrogen peroxide), glyceryl hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydrogen peroxides, dialkyl peroxides, alkyl peroxy acids, peroxy esters, diacyl peroxides, benzoyl peroxide, and monoperoxyphthalate, and mixtures thereof. Peroxy acids and their salts include organic peroxy acids such as alkyl peroxy acids, and monoperoxyphthalate and mixtures thereof, as well as inorganic peroxy acid salts such as persulfate, dipersulfate, percarbonate, perphosphate, perborate and persilicate salts of alkali and alkaline earth metals such as lithium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium and barium, and mixtures thereof. In various embodiments, the peroxide compound comprises hydrogen peroxide, urea peroxide, sodium percarbonate and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the peroxide compound comprises hydrogen peroxide. In one embodiment, the peroxide compound consists essentially of hydrogen peroxide. The peroxide compound comprises from about 0.1% to about 50%, optionally from about 1% to about 40%, optionally from about 10% to about 30% of the oral care composition.<br>
[0033] The peroxide compound may be the same as or different than the peroxide component. In one embodiment, the peroxide component and the peroxide compound are the same, both comprising hydrogen peroxide. The peroxide compound may be formulated in the composition as an aqueous solution. In one embodiment, the<br><br>
composition comprises an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide, comprising approximately 35% hydrogen peroxide in water.<br>
[0034] In one embodiment, the concentration of the peroxide complex is limited so that the peroxide component is no more than 6%, so as to maintain an preferred viscosity. In such an embodiment, the combination of the peroxide complex and peroxide compound comprise a total peroxide concentration of greater than 6%, operable to provide more effective bleaching. Furthermore, in alternative embodiments where a peroxy acid serves as the peroxide compound, the oxidizing strength of the oral care composition is increased due to the leaving qualities of the RCCVcomponent of the peroxy acid.<br>
[0035] In various embodiments, the compositions comprise a non-peroxide whitening agent. Non-peroxide whitening agents among those useful herein include non-peroxy compounds, such as chlorine dioxide, chlorites and hypochlorites. Chlorites and hypochlorites include those of alkali and alkaline earth metals such as lithium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium and barium. Non-peroxide whitening agents also include colorants, such as titanium dioxide and hydroxyapatite.<br>
[0036] The whitening agent preferably comprises from about 0.1% to about 20% of the oral care composition. In a preferred embodiment, the peroxide compound comprises from about 1% to about 10% of the oral care composition.<br>
Orally Acceptable Carrier<br>
[0037J The present invention provides compositions comprising an orally acceptable carrier. As used herein, an "orally acceptable carrier" refers to a material or combination of materials that are safe for use in the compositions of the present invention,<br><br>
commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, with which the peroxide complex and whitening agent may be associated while retaining significant efficacy. Preferably, the carrier does not substantially reduce the efficacy of the peroxide complex or whitening agent. Selection of specific carrier components is dependant on the desired product form, including dentifrices, rinses, gels, and paints. In various embodiments, the carrier is operable to sufficiently adhere the peroxide complex against surfaces within the oral cavity to which the composition is administered, without concomitant use of a dental tray, mouthpiece, tape, or similar appliance. In various embodiments, the carrier is operable for use with a tape, tray, mouthpiece or similar appliance.<br>
[0038] Materials among those that are useful in carriers include adhesion agents, viscosity modifiers, diluents, surfactants, foam modulators, peroxide activators, peroxide stability agents, abrasives, pH modifying agents, humectants, mouth feel agents, sweeteners, flavorants, colorants, and combinations thereof. It is understood that while general attributes of each of the above categories of materials may differ, there may be some common attributes and any given material may serve multiple purposes within two or more of such categories of materials. Preferably, such carrier materials are selected for compatibility with the peroxide complex and with other ingredients of the composition.<br>
[0039] In various embodiments, the carrier comprises an adhesion agent. As referred to herein, an adhesion agent is a material or combination of materials that enhance the retention of the peroxide complex on the oral cavity surface onto which the composition is applied. Such adhesion agents include adhesives, film forming materials, viscosity enhancers and combinations thereof. Such materials include hydrophilic organic polymers, hydrophobic organic polymers, silicone gums, silicone adhesives, silicas, and combinations<br><br>

Suitable silicone polymers include the copolymer product of mixing a silanol terminated polydiorganosiloxane such as polydimethyl siloxane with a silanol-containing silicone resin whereby the silanol groups of the polydiorganosiloxane undergo a condensation reaction with the silanol groups of the silicone resin so that the polydiorganosiloxane is lightly crosslinked by the silicone resin (that is, the polydiorganosiloxane chains are bonded together through the resin molecules to give chain branching and entanglement and/or a small amount of network character) to form the silicone pressure sensitive adhesive. A catalyst, for example an alkaline material such as ammonia, ammonium hydroxide or ammonium carbonate, can be mixed with the silanol-terminated<br><br>
polydiorganosiloxane and the silicone resin to promote this crosslinking reaction. Copolymerizing the silicone resin with the silanol terminated polydiorganosiloxane affords a self adhering and cohesive soft elastomer matrix.

In one embodiment, a whitening agent, silicone adhesive and carrier fluid are mixed to form a homogenous mixture. The peroxide complex is then added to the homogenous mixture and the newly formed composition is mixed under a vacuum. In one embodiment, the liquid<br>
-v<br>
ingredients are combined (e.g., in the order of whitening agent such as liquid hydrogen peroxide, silicone fluid, silicone adhesive fluid and Pluracare), and mixed at high speed for 30 minutes. Plastigel (if present) is then added and the solution is mixed at high speed for five minutes. Finally, the peroxide complex is added and the composition is mixed at high speed for fifteen minutes under vacuum. Additional ingredients such as flavorant, coloring or sweeteners are added at any point during the mixing process but in various embodiments such ingredients are preferably added last or close to last. In some embodiments., the peroxide complex is formed in situ, such that the method comprises mixing a peroxide component (e.g., solution of hydrogen peroxide) and N-vinyl heterocyclic polymer (e.g., cPVP), with an additional quantity of peroxide compound. In other embodiments, the peroxide complex is formed prior to addition to the remainder of the composition.<br>
Methods<br>
[0081] The present invention provides methods for whitening a tooth surface using compositions according to the present invention. As referred to herein, "tooth" or "teeth" refers to natural teeth, dentures, dental plates, fillings, caps, crowns, bridges, dental<br><br>
implants, and the like, and any other hard surfaced dental prosthesis either permanently or temporarily fixed within the oral cavity. As used herein, "whitening" refers to a change in visual appearance of a tooth, preferably such that such that the tooth has a brighter shade.<br>
[0082] Increase in whiteness of a dental surface can be observed visually, for example with the aid of color comparison charts or gauges, or measured by colorimetry, using any suitable instrument such as a Minolta Chromameter, e.g., model CR-400 (Minolta Corp., Ramsey, NJ). The instrument can be programmed, for example, to measure Hunter Lab values or L*a*b* values according to the standard established by the International Committee of Illumination (CIE). The L*a*b* system provides a numerical representation of three-dimensional color space where L* represents a lightness axis, a* represents a red-green axis and b* represents a yellow-blue axis. The L* and b* axes are typically of greatest applicability to measurement of tooth whiteness. Increase in whiteness can be computed from differences in L*, a* and b* values before and after treatment, or between untreated and treated surfaces. A useful parameter is AE*, calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of differences in L*, a* and b* values, using the formula:<br>
AE* = [(AL*)2 + (Aa*)2 + (Ab*)2]l/2<br>
A higher value of AE* indicates greater increase in whiteness. In various embodiments, the method of the present invention can effect a AE* of at least about 1, or at least about 3, or at least about 4, or at least about 5.<br>
[0083] Accordingly, the present invention provides methods for whitening a tooth surface, comprising applying to the surface a safe and effective amount of a mixture of a peroxide complex comprising a peroxide compound and a porous cross-linked polymer and a whitening agent. Preferably the method comprises applying a composition of the present<br><br>
invention, comprising the peroxide complex, whitening agent, and a carrier. As referred to herein, "applying" refers to any method by which the peroxide complex is placed in contact with the tooth surface. Such methods, in various embodiments, comprise direct application of a composition by such methods as rinsing, painting, and brushing. In various embodiments, application of the composition comprises the use of an application device which aids in maintaining contact of the composite to the tooth surface for sufficient time so as to allow whitening.<br>
[0084] Suitable application devices include dental trays, mouthpieces, floss, fibers, chips, strips and tapes. Strips among those useful herein comprise polymers, natural and synthetic woven materials, non-woven material, foil, paper, rubber and combinations thereof. Preferably the strip of material is substantially water insoluble. Suitable polymers include polyethylene, ethylvinylacetate, polyesters, ethylvinyl alcohol, fluoroplastics, and combinations thereof In various embodiments, the strip of material is generally less than about 1 mm (millimeter) thick, optionally less than about 0.05 mm thick, optionally about 0.001 to about 0.03 mm thick. The shape of the strip is any shape and size that covers the desired oral surface. In one embodiment, the length of the strip material is from about 2 cm (centimeter) to about 12 cm, in another embodiment from about 4 cm to about 9 cm. The width of the strip material will also depend on the oral surface area to be covered. The width of the strip is generally from about 0.5 cm to about 4 cm, in one embodiment from about 1 cm to about 2 cm. The strip material may comprise shallow pockets, optionally filled by a composition of this invention so as to provide reservoirs of peroxide complex. Strips among those useful herein are disclosed in U.S. Patent 6,514,484, Rajaiah et al. issued February 4, 2003.<br><br>
[0085] In one preferred embodiment, the whitening composition is applied using a "paint on" technique. A small application device, such as a brush or spatula is coated with a composition of this invention and the composition is then placed on a tooth surface. Preferably, the composition be spread evenly on such surfaces, in sufficient quantity to deliver a whitening amount of peroxide complex.<br>
[0086] The present invention also provides methods for effecting the controlled release of an oxidizing peroxide species onto a tooth surface, comprising contacting the surface with a mixture of a peroxide complex and whitening agent of the present invention. As referred to herein, such controlled release in various embodiments comprises release of the peroxide over a time sufficient to effect whitening of the teeth. Without limiting the mechanism, function or utility of present invention, in some embodiments contact with saliva causes the release of an effective amount of peroxide active from the cross-linked polymer matrix to the applied tooth site over a period of time. Preferably, the composition is contacted with the tooth surface for at least about 30 seconds, optionally at least about 1 minute.<br>
[0087] In various embodiments, it is preferred that the subject does not eat or drink while the composition is in contact with the dental surface. The whitening composition can be removed as and when required, at will, by an employment of standard oral hygiene procedures such as brushing or by rinsing, e.g., with a mouthwash. The process can be repeated several times until the desired whitening results are achieved.<br>
[0088] In various embodiments, compositions of the present invention are also used for the treatment or prevention of disorders in the oral cavity, including cavity prevention, whitening, plaque prevention or reduction, gingivitis prevention or reduction,<br><br>
tartar control, sensitivity prevention or reduction, breath malodor prevention or reduction, and stain prevention. Compositions of the present invention may also be used for the treatment or prevention of systemic disorders, such as the improvement of overall systemic health characterized by a reduction in risk of development of systemic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, severe respiratory infection, premature and low birth weight infants (including associated post-partum dysfunction in neurologic/developmental function), and associated increased risk of mortality. Such methods include those disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication 2003/0206874, Doyle et al., published November 6, 2003.<br>
[0089]       The present invention is further illustrated through the following non-limiting examples.<br>
Example 1 [0090]       A composition of the present invention is made, as follows: <br>
(Figure Remove) [0091] The liquid hydrogen peroxide, DC silicone fluid, and silicone adhesive are combined and mixed at high speed for 30 minutes. The Plastigel is then added and the solution is mixed at high speed for five minutes. Finally, the peroxide complex, flavorant and sweetener are added and the composition is mixed at high speed for 20 minutes under vacuum until the composition is homogenous.<br>
[0092] The composition is applied to the teeth of a human subject having stained teeth, resulting in perceptible whitening.Example 2<br>
[0093]       A composition of the present invention is made, as follows: <br>
(Figure Remove) [0094]      The composition is made by a process generally as described above in<br>
Example 1.<br><br>
[0095] (Figure Remove)<br>
 [0096] The composition is made by a process generally as described above in Example 1. The composition is subjected to accelerated aging conditions (105°F/120°F) for several weeks, and remains stable with more than 90% of the peroxide remaining.<br>
[0097J The whitening efficacy of the composition is determined using a duplicate pair of flow cells designed to accommodate a total of eight bovine enamel blocks (four in each cell). The bovine enamel blocks are obtained freshly stained using an established staining protocol (Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN)- The initial L*, a* and b* values are matched as closely as possible prior to an experiment using a chromometer (Minolta CR-321) based on initial L*, a* and b* values (CffiLAB). These initial values are typically L* = 25.00, a* = 3.00, and b* = 5.00 to L* = 35.00, a* = 5,00, and b* = 7.00. The L, a, b values are measured four times at slightly differing locations on the surface of the bovine enamel blocks.<br>
[0098] To simulate the saliva of the human mouth, an artificial saliva buffer solution maintained at 37°C is prepared which contains the salts usually present in saliva at levels typical to the levels found in human saliva. The bovine enamel blocks are placed in the flow cells and the compositions evenly applied using a brush, the amount of product applied is determined using the weight difference of the container. Flow over the teeth is 0.6 ml/min. for 30 min. Average initial and final chromometer readings is used to calculate AE according to AE = ((Lf- L,)2 + (bf- b,)2 + (arai)2)'^. The results of the tests, set forth in the following table, show that the composition has a whitening effect. (Figure Remove)<br><br>
