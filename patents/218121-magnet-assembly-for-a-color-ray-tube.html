				<td>MAGNET ASSEMBLY FOR A COLOR RAY TUBE<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a magnet assembly for a color ray tube (CRT), and more particularly, to a magnet<br>
nsr.omtaly for a CRT which allown cany fabrication and<br>
A conventional CRT is provided with an electron gun 3 for emitting three electron beams (R, G and D) within a neck portion 2, and a magnet assembly 10 for uniting the R, G and B alactron beams emitted from electron gun 3 in the outer periphery of the electron-gun incorporating neck portion 2, as shown in FIG. 1.<br>
Magnet assembly 10 includes a magnet support 30 fixedly inserted into the outer periphery of neck portion 2, a pair of two-, four- and six-pole magnet rings 40, 50 and 60 rotatably installed in the outer periphery of magnet support 30, spacers 70 inserted between the respective pairs of magnet rings, a magnet fixture 80 having an inner peripheral surface screw 81 screw-coupled to an outer peripheral surface screw 31 of mangnet support 30 for preventing the fluctuation of the resp-.ctive magnet rings 40, 50 and 60 and spacer 70 01- magnet support 30, and a ring band 20 coupled to the upper end of magnet support 30 for closely fixing magnet support 30 on neck portion 2 according to the engagement of a bolt 21, as shown in FIG. 2.<br>
Two-, four- and six-pole magnet rings 40, 50 and 60 are<br>
formed such that north and south poles are disposed in terms of 180°, 90° and 60°, respectively.<br>
If R,-G and B electron beams emitted electron gun 3 are not converged on the center of a screen 4 due to various errors exhibited during a manufacturing process of such a CRT, two-, four- and six-pole magnet rings 40, 50 and 60 of magnet assembly 10 installed in the outer periphery of neck portion 2 are turned in the peripheral direction of neck portion 2 to converge the three electron beams on the center of screen 4. Then, magnet fixture 80 is screw-coupled to magnet support 30 i.o prevent the fluctuation of the respective magnet rings. As described above, in order to fixedly install magnet<br>
manembly 10 on neck portion 2, bolt 21 of ring band 20 should be rotated by a driver. Also, in order to prevent the "Luctuation of the respective magnet rings, magnet fixture 80<br>
should be screw-coupled to magnet support 30. Therefore, a lot of assembly operation time is required. Also, the manufacturing cost is increased due to a lot of assembly  .<br>
 ary of the invention<br>
•<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a magnet assembly for a CRT which simplifies its configuration by reducing the number of assembly parts and facilitates the assembly.<br>
To accomplish the above objects, there is provided a mngnet assembly for a CRT, installed in the outer periphery of a neck portion incorporating an electron gun for emitting R, G<br>

Dolailed  Description of the Invention<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, a magnet assembly for a CRT according to the present invention includes a magnet support 100 inserted into the outer periphery of a neck portion, a pair of two  four- and six-pole magnet rings 40, 50 and 60 rotatably installed in the outer periphery of magnet support 100, each spacer 70 inserted between the each pair of magnet rings, and<br>
a magnet fixture  200 coupled in the outer periphery of magnet support 100 for fixing magnet support 100 on the. neck portion and preventing magnet rings 40, 50 and 60 and spacer 70 from bring fluctuated on magnet support 100.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, magnet support 100 includes a<br>
cylindrical main body 110, a hook 130 installed in one end of main body 110, a plurality of nodes 150 formed in one end having hook 130 installed therein in a lateral direction of main body 110 in a predetermined interval, a node 170 formed in other end of main body 110, and a flange 190 formed in other end of main body 110.<br>
Magnet fixture 200 includes a first fixture 300 coupled to mngnet support 100 and a plurality of second fixtures 400 rotatably coupled to first fixture 300, as shown in FIGS. 5 and 6.<br>
First fixture 300 includes a ring 310 having a curvature<br>
T<br>
radius (D2) larger than the radius (D,) of main body 110 and having a circular section having a diameter of d,, and a plurality of extensions 330 elongated toward a center 0, of ring 310, as shown in FIG. 5.<br>
Second fixtures 400 each includes first and second cams •51.0 and 420 integrally formed and having a common rotary •ontroid 02, a circular hole 430 having a diameter corresponding to the diameter d, of ring 310 around the rotary centroid 02, and into which ring 310 is inserted, a node 450 linked to circular hole 430 and externally enlarged therefrom, and an arm 470 formed at about 135° clockwise in terms of node 450 and inserted into hook 130, as shown in FIG. 6. First and second cams 410 and 420 of second fixtures 400 are formed so that the length L, of one cam is different from the length Lj of the other in view of the rotary centroid 02.<br>
The operation of the magnet assembly for a CRT according to the present invention will now be described.<br><br>
Ring 310 of first fixture 300 is inserted into circular he to 430  through node 450 of second fixtures 400 to complete qnnt fixture 200 constituted by first fixture 300 and second xtares 400. In such a state, second fixtures 400 are capable in  rotation in terms of the rotary centroid 02 of circular hole<br>
;<br>
4 0 into which ring 310 of first fixture 300.<br>
Next, magnet fixture 200, spacer 70, as conventionally, a pair  of six-pole magnet rings 60, spacer 70, a pair of four-pole magnet rings '50, spacer 70 and a pair of two-pole magnet rings 40 are sequentially inserted into the periphery of mangnet support 100 through one end of magnet support 100 haiving node 170 and whose outer diameter can be elastically varied, thereby completing the magnet assembly.<br>
The various parts inserted into magnet support 100 in such a way are not out of position by flange 190 formed in one end of elastically-restored magnet support 100.<br>
Then, the magnet assembly is installed in the outer periphery of the neck portion having an integrally formed electron gun and the respective magnet rings 40, 50 and 60 are rotated in a suitable manner to converge the R, G and B electron beams emitted from the eJ^ctron gun.<br>
Next, as shown in FIG. 7, if second fixture 400 of magnet fixture 200 is rotated around the rotary centroid 02 so that arm 470 of second fixture 400 is inserted into hook 130 of magnet support 100, first cam 410 of second fixture 400 is rotated to pull spacers 70 and the respective magnet rings 40, so and fin HO ns to be closeJy contacted with hook 190 of  uinot support 100, thereby fixing the same to prevent their<br><br>
any. Second cam 420 of second fixture 400 rotates to press nain body 110 of magnet support 100 to then be closely contacted with the neck portion.    '<br>
In other words, by only a bout of rotation of second fixture 400 of second fixture 200, spacers 70 and the tesrpective magnet rings 40, 50 and 60 can be fixed and the magnet  assembly can be fixed on the neck portion.<br>
FIGS. 8 through 10 show the magnet assembly for a CRT According to the second embodiment of the present invention,<br>
t<br>
in which a magnet support 100' includes a hook 130' formed in slightly front of one end of cylindrical main body 110', a second fixture 400 includes a single cam 410', and another structure is the same as that of the first embodiment except that the first embodiment employs a separate fixing means such as the conventional ring band 20 for fixing magnet support 100 on neck portion 2.<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, since the fabrication of a magnet assembly can be implemented by a bout of rotation, the fabrication work is easy and simple. Also, since the number of necessary parts is reduced, the structure is simplified, which causes the reduction of the manufacturing cost.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
