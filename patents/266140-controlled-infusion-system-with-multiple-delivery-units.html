MULTICHANNEL COORDINATED INFUSION SYSTEM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is generally related to monitoring the amount of medical fluid<br>
delivered by a pump, and more particularly, to accurately monitoring the amount of<br>
5     medical  fluid remaining and calculating  a flow rate for complete  delivery in  a<br>
predetermined time period.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is known for infusion systems that contain multiple infusion pumping modules to<br>
include a centrally managed infusion pump system in which pump and monitoring<br>
10 modules are selectively attached to a central management unit. The central management<br>
unit controls the internal setup and programming of the attached modules, and receives and<br>
displays information from them. Each module is capable of being detached from the<br>
central management unit.<br>
v<br>
Due to inaccuracies of the infusion system, that can be plus or minus 5% or more<br>
15 over long periods, and other factors such as intravenous (IV) bag overfill or interruptions<br>
in flow, a desired volume of a drug may not be infused within a desired period and the<br>
infusion may be ahead or behind schedule by, in some cases, an hour or two. The<br>
clinician, i.e. a person qualified in the clinical practice of medicine, psychiatry, or<br>
psychology, must then manually increase or decrease the flow rate in order to compensate<br>
20 for these factors as soon as the problem is recognized. Interruptions in receiving<br>
medication can result in inconvenience and delay for the patient and clinicians, as well as<br>
potentially negative therapeutic efficacy of the medication. Drag toxicity may also<br>
become a problem where the infusion rate is increased toward the end of the infusion to<br>
assure on-time completion.<br>
25	One approach clinicians use to deal with the above problem is to weigh the IV bag<br>
to determine the exact volume of the bag. This is not a fully satisfactory approach, since<br>
the bag must be carefully weighed in the pharmacy and the empty weight of the bag<br>
subtracted from the total weight of the bag.   Differences in accuracy of the scale and<br><br>
WO 2006/034178	PCT/US2005/03345I<br>
correction for the specific gravity (density) of the solution (which is.usually not known)<br>
result in additional inaccuracies. Typically, a clinician sets an infusion flow rate based<br>
upon the derived volume of the solution. This method does not allow for accurate<br>
correction of flow rate due to interruptions in flow once the infusion is initiated and thus<br>
5 may not deliver the infusion medication to the patient over the desired time period. At the<br>
completion of an infusion that has been subjected to interruptions, the clinician is often left<br>
with a sizable volume of residual medication remaining in the IV bag or tubing that must<br>
be flushed, or discarded. If the residual volume is discarded, the patient may not receive<br>
the full dose intended by.the clinician, thus reducing the medication's effect.<br>
10	Therefore, there has been identified a continuing need to  provide  a medical<br>
infusion system that will accurately infuse a medication over predetermined periods of<br>
time.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Briefly and in general terms, the present invention is directed to an infusion system<br>
15      that delivers a first infusate, preferably a medication, to an IV line, and a second infusate,<br>
preferably a neutral carrying solution, to the patient's IV line.  The infusion system also<br>
includes a measurement device that determines an amount of undelivered first infusate<br>
remaining in the system. Furthermore, the infusion system includes a control system that<br>
controls delivery of the first infusate, and that enables input of a predetermined volume of<br>
20     the first infusate to be delivered, and input of a time period within which infusion of the<br>
first infusate volume should occur.  The control system also communicates with first and<br>
second delivery devices and the measurement device to determine an optimum first<br>
infusate infusion  flow  rate  based  on  the  predetermined first infusate  volume,  the<br>
predetermined infusion time period, and the determined amount of undelivered first<br>
25     infusate remaining in the system, and controls the first delivery device to deliver the first<br>
infusate ait an optimum infusion flow rate.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the invention, there is further provided an<br>
infusion system comprising a first delivery device that delivers an infusion ultra filtrate to<br>
a hemofilter, and a first measurement device that determines the amount of infusion<br>
30     ultrafiltrate in the infusion system.  The infusion system also includes a second delivery<br><br>
WO 2006/034178	PCT/US2005/033451<br>
device that receives a patient's removed ultrafiltrate from the hemofilter, and a second,<br>
measurement device that determines an amount of removed, ultrafiltrate in the infusion<br>
system. Furthermore, the infusion system includes a control system communicating with<br>
me first and second delivery devices and the first and second measurement units to<br>
5 determine optimum flow rates to and from the hemofilter, based upon the determined<br>
amounts of infusion ultrafiltrate and removed ultrafiltrate in the infusion system, and a<br>
predetermined desired pressure differential between the infusion and removed<br>
ultrafiltrates, and for controlling the first and second delivery units accordingly.<br>
In other aspects the invention, there is provided a method of infusing a first infusate<br>
10     into a patient.   The clinician or the system itself determines the total volume of first<br>
infusate that is to be infused into the patient.  The clinician then ascertains the period of<br>
time over which it is desired that the total volume of first infusate is to be infused, such as<br>
twenty-four hours.   A position sensor of a syringe pump or the weight cell of a large<br>
volume pump detects the remaining amount of first infusate to be infused.   A control<br>
15      system constantly calculates the time remaining in the predetermined period,   The large<br>
volume pump (LVP) delivers the second infusate into the patient's infusion line while<br>
either a syringe pump or a LVP and weight cell combination infuses the first Infusate into<br>
the TV line.    The control system preferably constantly and automatically adjusts the<br>
infusion flow rate based on the remaining amount of first infusate to be infused and the<br>
20     time remaining in the predetermined time period.  The detecting, calculating, delivering,<br>
infusing, and adjusting steps are preferably repeated until the total volume of first infusate<br>
is infused.<br>
In yet other aspects, there is provided a method of infusing an ultrafiltrate into a<br>
patient comprising the  steps  of delivering an infusion  ultrafiltrate to  a hemofilter,<br>
25 measuring the amount of infusion ultrafiltrate in the infusion system, receiving a patient's<br>
removed ultrafiltrate from the hemofilter, measuring the amount of removed ultrafiltrate in<br>
the infusion system, and adjusting flow rates of the delivering and the receiving steps<br>
based upon the measured amounts of infusion and removed ultrafiltrate in the infusion<br>
system and  a predetermined desired pressure differential between the infusion and<br>
30      removed ultrafiltrates.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring now to the drawings with more particularity, in which like reference<br>
5      numerals   refer  to   like   or  corresponding  elements   among  the   several   views,   the<br>
multichannel   coordinated   infusion   system   according   to   the   invention   infuses   a<br>
predetermined volume of medication over a specific predetermined time period, such as<br>
1000 ml of a chemotherapeutic agent over a 24 hour period.<br>
The present invention will be explained by way of example whereby a patient<br>
10      undergoes  a chemotherapy medication  or other medication infusion.     It should be<br>
understood that such an example is for illustrative purposes only.<br>
Typically, a chemotherapy medication is infused over multiple sessions lasting<br>
many days. Due to inaccuracies in some infusion systems or interruptions in the delivery<br>
of an infusion, the infusion may be early or late by many hours by the end of the infusion<br>
15 session. The present invention addresses this problem and illustrative embodiments are<br>
provided below. In one embodiment, an accurate fluid transferring device, for example a<br>
weight cell in combination with a large volume infusion pump ("LVP") is used where the<br>
fluid transferring device is controlled, by an intelligent control module.<br>
Syringe pumps typically consist of a cylinder that holds a fluid that is expelled by<br>
20     an advancing plunger.   The plunger is usually advanced into the cylinder by a drive<br>
mechanism that includes a motor connected through a gear or gears to a driver head to<br>
provide a relatively constant pulse-free flow. In accordance with an aspect of the present<br>
invention, a means is provided for accurately infusing a predetermined volume of fluid<br>
over a predetermined period.  Rather than programming a specific flow rate, a clinician<br>
25      may program a specific volume to be infused over a specific period and the system<br>
automatically adjusts the flow rate, within certain parameters, based on the remaining<br>
volume   to   be  infused   and  the  remaining  period  for  infusion.      The   system   also<br>
accommodates for any changes in starting and stopping of the system due to circumstances<br>
that might occur during infusion such as an occlusion or air in the infusion line or for some<br>
30     other reason where the infusion needs to be momentarily stopped.<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2006/034178	PCT/US2005/033451<br>
Typically, medication solutions are provided in concentrated form, and must be<br>
diluted prior to infusion into the patient. As syringes generally contain relatively small<br>
volumes of fluid, as compared to IV drip bags, many syringe-borne medications are<br>
provided in concentrated form and must be diluted during administration. The present<br>
5 invention allows concentrated medications in a syringe to be diluted on a continuous basis<br>
by a neutral carrying solution such as normal saline solution supplied via a large volume<br>
pump(LVP).<br>
FIG. 1 is a view of a multichannel coordinated infusion system 10 according to one<br>
embodiment  of the invention.     The multichannel coordinated infusion  system  10<br>
10 incorporates a programmable patient care system similar to that disclosed in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,713,856 to Eggers, issued February 3, 1998, which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference. The programmable patient: care system includes a patient care unit (PCU) 12 in<br>
combination with at least two functional units 14 and 16. The PCU 12 incorporates a<br>
control system and generally performs four functions in the patient care system: it provides<br>
15 a physical attachment of the system to structures such as IV mounting poles and bed rails;<br>
it provides power to the system; it provides an interface between the system and external<br>
devices, and, except for certain information; and it provides a majority of the user interface<br>
with the system.<br>
FIG. 2 is an enlarged view of the PCU 12 shown in FIG. 1. The PCU 12 includes<br>
20      an information display 18 that may be any type of display such as a liquid crystal display.<br>
The display 18 may be used during setup and operation procedures to facilitate data entryand editing. The display 18 may also be used to display various operating piirameters as<br>
described in relation to FIGS. 4 and 7. The PCU 12 may furthermore contain a plurality of<br>
hard keys 20 and softkeys S1-S14 for entering data and commands.  Hard keys 20 may<br>
25      include numerical hard keys 22, navigation keys 24 (such as up and down keys), an<br>
ENTER key 26, a CANCEL key 28, and an OPTIONS key 30. Other common keys exist<br>
such as POWER and SILENCE used to terminate an audible alarm.  The numerical hard<br>
keys 22 may partly be used for entering numerical data, while the remainder of the hard<br>
keys, as well as the softkeys S1-S14, may be used for entering operational commands. In<br>
30      this embodiment there are provided five softkeys S1-S5 on the left of the display 18, five<br>
soft keys S6-S10 on the right of the display 18, and four softkeys S11-S14 under the<br>
display 18.<br><br>
WO 2006/034178	PCT/US20O5/O33451<br>
Again referring to FIG. 1, there are two functional units 14 and 16 mounted to the<br>
PCU 12. The functional units 14 and 16 are preferably removably attached to the PCU 12<br>
and may be interchanged with other functional units as described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,713,856. It is to be understood that although two functional units 14 and 16 are shown in<br>
5 FIG. 1, a different number of functional units may be incorporated into the patient care<br>
system 10.<br>
The first functional unit 16 is preferably an infusion pump or the like. More<br>
specifically, the first functional unit 16 is preferably a large volume parenteral pump<br>
("LVP") with a flow rate of approximately 1000 to 2000 ml/hr, or more. The primary task<br>
10 of the first functional unit 16 in this embodiment is to deliver a dilution solution 32 into an<br>
IV line 34 inserted into a patient via a dilution infusion channel (Channel A), in this<br>
instance, the LVP 16. The dilution solution may be any neutral solution such as a normal<br>
saline solution, and is typically contained within a receptacle such as an IV bag 36.<br>
The second functional unit 14 is preferably a low-volume timed infusion pump,<br>
15      such as a syringe pump.    The primary task of the second functional unit 14 in this<br>
embodiment is to deliver a concentrated medication into the IV line 34 via a medication<br>
infusion channel (Channel B), in this instance, a syringe pump 14. The medication may be<br>
any type of drug in fluid form, for example a chemotherapeutic agent.<br>
The syringe pump 14, according to one embodiment, includes a syringe size<br>
20      detection system having a sensor 38, such, as a linear actuator,-to measure the syringe<br>
diameter that is then used to determine, using a look-up table or the like, the type of<br>
syringe that is being used. For example a syringe having twenty mm diameter- may have a<br>
fifty ml volume.   There may however be other syringes with the same diameter, so,according to one embodiment, a clinician is prompted to confirm the syringe size as will<br>
25      be discussed in relation to FIG. 4J.<br>
The syringe pump 14 may furthermore include a measurement device 40 such as an<br>
accurate linear position sensor that ascertains how far a plunger 42 of a syringe has<br>
traveled and how much farther the plunger 42 must travel to reach the end of its delivery<br>
stroke.   The plunger position taken together with the syringe size, enable a processor<br>
30     within the multichannel coordinated infusion system 10 (see US Patent No. 5,713,856) to<br><br>
WO 2006/034178	PCT/US2005/033451<br>
accurately determine the volume of medication remaining in the syringe.'    Such a<br>
determinaition can be made continuously in real time if desired.<br>
In use, the control system of the PCU 12 communicates with the functional units 14<br>
and 16, and the measurement device 40 to determine an optimum first infusate infusion<br>
5 flow rate based on a determined amount of undelivered first infusate remaining in the<br>
system, a predetermined volume of fluid to be infused, and a predetermined infusion time<br>
period. The control system of the PCU 12 then controls the flow rates of the functional<br>
units 14 and 16 accordingly.<br>
FIG. 3 is a graph 44 of flow rate 46 versus time 48 in a typical infusion session.<br>
10 Channel A is typically set up to infuse a pharmacologically inert (neutral) or carrier<br>
solution such as a saline solution at a maintenance flow rate until the medication is loaded<br>
and infusion begun. Typically, Channel A, the dilution channel, is continuously run to<br>
keep the IV line "open", although this is not a prerequisite. This initial flow of dilution is<br>
referred to as a maintenance infusion 50.  A different predetermined dilution flow rate 52<br>
15 on Channel A is set to begin infusing simultaneously with the start of a medication<br>
infusion 54 on Channel B. If the infusion of either Channel A or Channel B is interrupted<br>
56 or 58 for any reason, both Channels A and B will stop simultaneously. When the<br>
channel that initially stopped is restarted, both channels restart pumping simultaneously 60<br>
and 62. The PCU 12 automatically adjusts the rate of the medication infusion (Channel B)<br>
20 so as to infuse the remainder of a desired predetermined medication volume within the<br>
remainder of an allotted predetermined period. Once the desired medication has<br>
completely been infused, the medication infusion channel automatically stops 64. The<br>
dilution channel (Channel A) may however continue to infuse a maintenance infusion 66.<br>
FIGS. 4A to 4V are interface screens used in connection with an embodiment of<br>
25      the invention.  Using FIGS. 4A to 4V, an example of a user interface and control system<br>
will now be described.<br>
FIG. 4A is a main programming interface screen 70.   This main programming<br>
screen data 70 is displayed when the infusion system is either running or when the system<br>
is dormant or not running.  As a general rule, pressing a soft key (S1-S14 of FIG. 2) next<br>
30      to a displayed function will activate the function or command displayed next to it on the<br>
display screen.   "A" and "B" are indicative of the Channel A and Channel B infusion<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2006/034178	PCT/US2005/033451<br>
modules connected to the system. If more modules are connected to the system, an<br>
additional letter would be displayed for each module. The "volume infused" or "alarm<br>
loudness" functions or commands may also be accessed via the soft keys. By pressing the<br>
"Options" hard key (reference numeral 30 in FIG. 2) the screen of options 72 of FIG. 4B is<br>
5 displayed. FIG. 4B is a first options interface screen 72. A number of options concerning<br>
general operation are displayed on the screen. By pressing the "PAGE DOWN" soft key<br>
S14 (FIG. 2), a second options screen 74 is shown as per FIG. 4C.<br>
Options 74 more particularly relevant to infusion are presented in FIG. 4C.   By<br>
pressing the soft key S1 next to "Multichannel Infusion" the functions pertaining to further<br>
10      aspects of the present invention may be accessed.<br>
FIG. 4D presents an interface 76 for Multichannel Infusions. This interface relates<br>
to the setup of the maintenance flow of the saline solution via Channel A. The system<br>
defaults to entering the flow rate for the maintenance infusion. The clinician may then<br>
enter the desired flow rate in milliliters per hour (ml/h) as shown in FIG. 4E. For example,<br>
15 a maintenance flow rate of 10 ml/h is entered via the numerical hard keys. By pressing the<br>
soft key next to "VTBI" ("volume-to-be-infused") the interface screen 76 of FIG. 4F will<br>
be displayed. The clinician may enter an exact or approximate volume of maintenance<br>
fluid to be infused, such as 1000 ml as shown in FIG. 4G. The soft keys next to "Flush" or<br>
"Profile" may be pressed to alter either of these settings.    The "ENTER" hard key<br>
20 (reference number 26 in FIG. 2) may be pressed to confirm the variables that were input.<br>
FIG. 4H is the interface screen 76 of a confirmation. The clinician is again prompted to<br>
confirm the variables as a backup precaution. The "ENTER" hardkey is again pressed to<br>
confirm.<br>
FIG. 41 is a summary screen.   Here, Channel A is shown to be delivering the<br>
25      maintenance infusion. To move now to the medication Channel B, the soft key S2 located<br>
adjacent the "B" Channel screen indication is pressed, displaying the interface shown in<br>
FIG. 4J. FIG. 4J is a syringe confirmation screen. A feature specific to the syringe pump<br>
embodiment of the invention as shown in FIG. 4J is that the clinician must identify the<br>
type of syringe being used (as flow rate is dependent upon the rate of travel of the plunger<br>
30      and the diameter of the syringe barrel). The syringe type may be automatically determined<br>
by the pump, as discussed above, and are displayed as per this example; i.e., an IVAC 50<br>
ml syringe. The soft keys S7 or S8 may then be pressed to either confirm or change the<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2006/034178	PCT/US2005/033451<br>
detected syringe type. If the syringe type is incorrect, an interface screen trorn which the<br>
user may select a different syringe type will be displayed (not shown). If the syringe type<br>
is confirmed, the interface shown in FIG. 4K is displayed.<br>
The clinician is prompted to enter the medication infusion flow rate, wliich may be<br>
5      entered via the numerical hard keys.   If the clinician would prefer to infuse a specific<br>
volume or the entire volume of the syringe, the soft key S2 next to "VTBI" may be<br>
pressed. The clinician may either enter a volume to be infused, or, by either pressing the<br>
hard up or down keys (numeral 208 of FIG. 2) or the soft key S2 again, the clinician may<br>
select to infuse the entire contents of the syringe.    Infusing the entire contents of the<br>
10     syringe is evidenced by "ALL" next to "VTBI" as shown in FIG. 4L.  The "ALL" setting<br>
may alternatively be set as a default setting. Pressing the S3 soft key will select the option<br>
to input the duration of this infusion as shown in FIG. 4M.<br>
According to this embodiment of the invention, the clinician typically requires<br>
infusing a predetermined volume of medication over a predetermined time period. As<br>
15 described in relation to FIG. 4L, the clinician has selected to infuse the entire volume of<br>
the syringe. To input the period over which the entire volume is to be infused, the<br>
clinician enters the desired time via the numerical hard keys, for example a 24 hour period<br>
as shown in FIG. 4N. By pressing the S4 soft key the start time of the infusion may be<br>
entered as shown in FIG. 40.<br>
20	In FIG. 4P, the clinician has entered the desired start time of the infusion as 9:00.<br>
The system may alternatively be set to default to the current time and the clinician can<br>
utilize the up or down hard keys to change the start time. A delay in infusing the<br>
medication may be desirable in order to allow the clinician time to first perform another<br>
task, such as administering a pre-medication such as an anti-nauseant drug, prior to giving<br>
25      the chemotherapeutic medication via another syringe or infusion channel.<br>
As described above, the medication typically must be diluted with a neutral<br>
solution, such as saline, prior to infusion into the patient. To set up the dilution channel<br>
the clinician presses the S12 soft key associated with "DILUTE", which displays the<br>
dilution interface screen shown in FIG. 4Q. To enter the flow rate of the dilution solution<br>
30 the clinician presses the S2 soft key associated with "RATE", shown in FIG. 4R. A flow<br>
rate, for example 100 ml/h, may be entered via the numerical hard keys. By pressing the<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2006/034178	PCT/US2i0O5/O33451<br>
S3 soft key associated with "VTBI", the clinician may enter the approximate: volume ol<br>
dilution solution to be infused, for example 400 ml, as shown in FIG. 4S. Only an estimate<br>
is required as the more important parameter is the flow rate of the dilution solution. If<br>
during the infusion the system runs out of dilution solution, an alarm will sound and both<br>
5 Channel A and B will simultaneously stop until the dilution solution is replaced and the<br>
system restarted. To complete the dilution solution setup, the clinician presses the<br>
"ENTER" hard key (reference numeral 26 of FIG. 2). The dilution solution is infused<br>
simultaneously with the medication, and therefore the start time and duration aire the same<br>
for both the dilution Channel A and the medication infusion Channel B.<br>
10	FIG. 4T is an interface screen 84 for the Channel B setup where the clinician is<br>
prompted to press the "Enter" hard key to confirm the setup. By pressing "Enter", the<br>
interface 86 shown in FIG. 4U is displayed. FIG. 4U shows the infusion of both Channel<br>
A and B on a time line. Soft keys associated with either channel may be pressed to view<br>
or change that channel's setup.  If additional channels were connected to the system they<br>
15 too would be displayed. To start the system the clinician presses the S14 soft key below<br>
"START". Once the system has started running, the summary screen 88 in FIG. 4V is<br>
displayed. As per the example, the maintenance flow will immediately start infusing and<br>
the medication together with the dilution solution will only begin to infuse at 9:00. After<br>
9:00 the screen will change to show that the entire contents of the syringe are being<br>
20      infused and the duration for infusion would decrement over time.<br>
FIG. 5 is a flow chart of a method 98 of infusing a medication into a patient in<br>
accordance with the infusion system described above and shown in FIGS. 1-4. The<br>
clinician or the system itself, as described above, determines at step 90 the total volume of<br>
medication that is to be infused into the patient that may simply be to infuse the entire<br>
25 contents of an IV drip bag or syringe. The clinician then selects at step 94 the period in<br>
which the total volume of medication is to be infused, such as twenty-four hours. The<br>
linear position sensor 40 constantly detects at step 96 the remaining amount of medication<br>
to be infused. The control system constantly calculates at step 98 the time remaining in the<br>
predetermined period.  The pump delivers at step 100 the neutral carrier solution into an<br>
30 IV line while the syringe pump infuses at step 102 the medication into the infusion circuit.<br>
The control system constantly and automatically adjusts at step 104 the Channel B infusion<br>
flow rate based on the remaining. amount of medication to be infused and the time<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/034178	PCT/US2005/0J3451<br>
remaining in the predetermined period. The detecting, calculating, delivering, mrusing,<br>
and adjusting steps 92-104 are repeated at step 106 until the total volume of medication is<br>
infused.<br>
FIG. 6 presents a multichannel coordinated infusion system 110, according to<br>
5     another embodiment of the invention.  The multichannel coordinated infusion system is<br>
similar to the syringe pump embodiment described above. As in the prior embodiment the<br>
present multichannel coordinated infusion system comprises a PCU 12, including a control<br>
system, and a LVP 16.   Dilution solution 32 contained within an IV bag 36 is pumped<br>
through Channel A by the LVP into an IV line 34 connected to a patient.   The system<br>
10      further includes a functional unit 112 that comprises a LVP 114 and a weight cell 116.<br>
The weight cell communicates via wired or remote communication (e.g. infrared, Radio<br>
Frequency) with the PCU 12.<br>
In use, a receptacle 118, such as an IV drip bag, of unknown volume but having a<br>
known empty or tare weight containing a medication 120 is suspended from weight cell<br>
15 116. A clinician typically identifies the receptacle to be suspended from the weight cell<br>
(e.g. a commercially available 250 ml plastic solution bag), and enters this information<br>
together with the approximate volume and duration of the infusion into the PCU 12. The<br>
type of receptacle and hence its tare weight may be determined automatically by a<br>
receptacle detection system 122. The tare weight may be determined from a database in<br>
20 the PCU programmed with the names of manufacturers of receptacles and the tare weight<br>
of their receptacles, or the manufacturer may include a bar code or another information<br>
device on its receptacle that the PCU may be able to read. The pharmacist may weigh the<br>
dry bag and put in a bar code or other electronic tag, or the manufacturer may include an<br>
identifier on the receptacle including the manufacturer's name, model number, and weight<br>
25 of the bag in grams. The weight of the fluid in the receptacle is calculated by subtracting<br>
that specific container's known tare weight from the receptacle's net weight measured by<br>
the weight cell. A tube 100 delivers the medication of the bag through the LVP 114<br>
(Channel B) to connect with the IV line 34.<br>
The processor within the multichannel coordinated infusion system 110 (control<br>
30      system) automatically determines a precise infusion flow rate based on the predetermined<br>
total volume to be infused, the measured fluid weight, and the time remaining in the period<br>
allotted for the infusion. This determination may be made continuously and in real time if<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/034178	PCT/US2005/033451<br>
desired. Inaccuracies due to different specific gravities of fluid are generally minimal (as<br>
most medication fluids have specific gravities close to one, i.e. a similar mass to water<br>
which is used as a standard) but may be token into account by the multichannel<br>
coordinated infusion system 110. The system therefore automatically determines the<br>
5 weight change of the receptacle 118 and adjusts the medication infusion rate Ada Channel<br>
B accordingly, to insure complete delivery of the contents of the receptacle, or a specified<br>
volume, in the predetermined time period allotted for the infusion. In doing so, the system<br>
automatically adjusts for periods of no flow due to alarms, pause conditions, etc.<br>
The functional units 16 and 114 are preferably removably attached to the interface<br>
10      unit PCU 12 and may be interchanged with other functional units, as described above. It is<br>
to be understood that although two functional units are shown in FIG. 6, a different<br>
number of functional units may be incorporated into the patient care system 110.<br>
Typically LVPs need a positive head height to operate accurately.  In the weight<br>
cell embodiment discussed above, the constant control of the flow rate through Channel B<br>
15      negates the need for a positive head height. The arrangement above permits the- delivery of<br>
the entire contents of an unknown volume in an exact predetermined period of time.   It<br>
also results in the ability to deliver jointly controlled dilution and infusion solutions.<br>
FIGS. 2 and 3 are equally applicable to the weight cell embodiment described<br>
above.<br>
20	FIG. 7A to 7U are user interfaces used in connection with the above weight cell<br>
embodiment of the invention. The PCU used in connection with this embodiment is<br>
programmed in a similar manner to that explained in relation to the prior embodiment.<br>
Access to the multichannel infusion mode of the present invention is attained as described<br>
in relation to FIGS. 4A to 4C and shown in FIGS. 7A to 7C for the sake of completeness.<br>
25 A Maintenance flow rate for Channel A'is set as described in relation to FIGS. 4D to 4H<br>
and shown in FIGS. 7D to 7H for the sake of completeness. A summary screen where<br>
Channel A is shown to be delivering a maintenance infusion is shown in FIG 71. By<br>
pressing the S2 soft key next to "B" the interface screen 80 for the infusion setup is<br>
displayed as per FIG. 11.<br>
30	In a similar manner to that described in relation to FIGS. 4K to 4P, and shown in<br>
FIGS. 7J to 7O for the sake of completeness, the flow rate "RATE", volume to be infused<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2006/034178	PCT/US2005/033451<br>
"VTBI", duration of the infusion "DURATION" and the start time of the infusion "5TAKT<br>
TIME" are entered into the PCU 80. The programming of the flow rate is not critical to<br>
the system if the entire volume of the receptacle is to be infused as evidenced by "ALL".<br>
This is because the flow rate is constantly calculated by the multichannel coordinated<br>
5 infusion system that divides a calculated fluid weight by the number of hours and minutes<br>
remaining in an allotted period for the infusion. The weight of the infusion fluid in the<br>
receptacle is calculated by subtracting that specific container's known tare weight from the<br>
receptacle's net weight measured by the weight cell.<br>
The Channel A dilution infusion is then set as described in relation to FIGS. 4Q to<br>
10      4S and shown in FIGS. 7P to 7R for the sake of completeness.    An infusion setup<br>
confirmation screen 130 is then presented to the clinician as per FIG. IS. The clinician is<br>
prompted to press "ENTER" to confirm the setup shown in FIG. 7S.     On pressing<br>
"ENTER", the interface screen 86 shown in FIG. 7T is displayed.   FIG. 7T shows the<br>
infusion of both Channel A and B on a time line. Soft keys associated with any channel<br>
15     may be pressed to view or change that channel's setup.   If additional channels were<br>
connected to the system they too would be displayed.   To start the system the clinician<br>
presses the S14 soft key below "START".    Once the system has started running, the<br>
summary screen 88 in FIG. 7U is displayed.  As per the example described in relation to<br>
the prior embodiment, the maintenance flow will immediately start infusing and the<br>
20	medication together with the dilution solution will only begin to infuse at 9:00. After 9:00<br>
this screen will change to show that the entire contents of the receptacle are being infused<br>
21	and the duration would decrement over time.<br>
The method of infusing a medication into a patient in accordance with the infusion<br>
system of FIGS. 6-7 is the same as that explained in relation to the prior embodiment,<br>
25      except that the position sensor of the weight cell constantly detects  at step 96 the<br>
remaining amount of medication to be infused, and the LVP and weight cell combination<br>
infuses at step 102 the medication into the infusion circuit.<br>
FIG. 8 presents a multichannel coordinated infusion system 140 according to a<br>
further embodiment of the invention.    Multichannel coordinated infusion system is<br>
30      typically used for continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) such as continuous<br>
arteriovenous   hemofiltration    (CAVH)   or   continuous    arteriovenous    hemodialysis<br>
(CAVHD) and is essentially a bed site replacement for a normal hemodialysis procedure.<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2006/034178	PCT/US20 05/033451<br>
Patients with chronic renal failure usually make use of a normal hemodialysis<br>
procedure. Hemodialysis is often very difficult for the patient, as there is a large amount<br>
of fluid shifts and electrolyte changes as well as many physiologic change.1; that occur<br>
while the patient is having his or her blood cleansed by a hemodialysis machine.   The<br>
5 procedure generally drains the patient's energy making him/her tired and weal::. Such side<br>
effects are even more pronounced with patients who are critically ill. Patient's bodies often<br>
cannot tolerate the procedure as their blood pressure drops and they have other physiologic<br>
problems. To overcome the extreme nature of hemodialysis, the CRRT (CAVH and<br>
CAVHD) procedures were developed.  CRRT is similar to hemodialysis, except that the<br>
10 patient is on the machine (the filter system) continuously rather than for several hours at<br>
varying increments of time. In CRRT, it is important to keep accurate records of dialysis<br>
liquids and intravenous liquids entering the patient and the amount of liquids leaving the<br>
patient. That is, a mass balance must exist when liquids are drawn and replaced from a<br>
patient. Severe clinical problems, and even death, may occur if these fluid balances are not<br>
15 carefully regulated. The advantage of these therapies is that they are less stressful on the<br>
body and provide continuous treatment as opposed to three to four hour hemodialysis<br>
sessions.<br>
The goal of these procedures is the same as hemodialysis, to clean the blood, but<br>
the process is more gradual. CAVH typically uses the patient's arterial blood pressure to<br>
20 deliver blood to a low-resistance hemofilter. To maintain systemic blood pressure, the<br>
patient receives replacement fluids. CAVHD is a modification of the CAVH method that<br>
uses an infusion pump to move a dialysate solution countercurrent to blood flow, adding<br>
the ability to continuously remove solute while removing fluid.<br>
Both CAVH and CAVHD provide continuous renal replacement therapy, thus<br>
25      allowing removal of solutes and modification of the volume and composition of the<br>
extracellular fluid to occur evenly over time. Unstable patients, who are often intolerant of<br>
the abrupt fluid volume and solute concentration changes that accompany standard<br>
hemodialysis treatments, can usually be treated safely with CAVH or CAVHD.<br>
The hemofiltration system utilizes a small filter that is highly permeable to water<br>
30      and small solutes, but impermeable to plasma proteins and the formed elements of the<br>
blood. The filter is placed in an extra corporeal circuit. As the blood perfuses through the<br>
hemofitter an ultrafiltrate of plasma is removed. The ultrafiltrate is concurrently replaced<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2006/034178	PCT/US2005/033451<br>
using a fluid with an electrolyte composition that is either similar to that ot normal plasma<br>
or specifically designed to correct abnormalities in the individual patient. The<br>
hemofiltration circuit connects a large artery and vein. Blood is typically pumped through<br>
the circuit by the heart, allowing the patient's arterial-to-venous pressure gradient to<br>
5 provide the pressure to drive the system. This system however does not accurately control<br>
the fluid mass balance discussed above.<br>
In the present invention, a dialysis filter 144 is connected between an arterial<br>
venous ("AV") shunt on one side and two weight cells and LVP combination modules 146<br>
and 148 on the other. The LVP combination modules are both controlled by a single PCU<br>
10 150. Blood 152 from the patient enters the filter and an ultrafiltrate 154 is removed and<br>
contained in receptacle 156, leaving only blood cellular components, and blood plasma<br>
proteins. A replacement ultrafiltrate 158 enters the filter 144 via a conduit 160 and is<br>
mixed with the separated blood plasma proteins before returning 162 the blood to the<br>
patient.   The flow rate of the ultrafiltrate 154 removed from the patient is monitored by<br>
15 PCU 150 that controls the LVP module 146. Likewise, the flow rate of the ultrafiltrate<br>
158 replaced into the patient is accurately controlled by the PCU 150 that controls the LVP<br>
module 104.<br>
By doing so, the PCU 150 controls the LVP module 148 to accurately deliver an<br>
infusion into an IV line based on the flow rate desired.    The LVP module 146 is<br>
20 programmed to accurately withdraw fluid from the line by measuring the amount of fluid<br>
withdrawn. The system can be programmed to maintain a preset difference between the<br>
two infusions to result in an accurate positive or negative balance. Similar to the<br>
embodiments described above, since the two infusion modules 146 and 148 are<br>
programmed by the same PCU 150, when one infusion module stops for any reason, the<br>
25      second module will also stop.<br>
Improved accuracy, control and the ability to program either a positive or negative<br>
pressure differential in a CRRT system may be achieved using the multichannel<br>
coordinated infusion system 140 with weight cell capability and central PCU 150 control.<br>
The multichannel coordinated infusion system 140 is also able to overcome conditions<br>
30 such as high intake and output pressure differences that significantly affect volume of<br>
delivery or withdrawal.<br>

WO 2006/034178	PCT/US2005/033451<br>
FIG. 9 is a flow chart of a method 170 of infusing an ultrafiltrate into a patient. An<br>
infusion ultrafiltrate is first delivered to a hemofilter at step 172.   A weight cell then<br>
measures at step 174 the amount of infusion ultrafiltrate in the infusion system.   At the<br>
same time the patient's removed ultrafiltrate is received at step 176 from the hemofilter.<br>
5      The amount of removed ultrafiltrate in the infusion system is measured at step 178 after<br>
which the flow rates to and from the hemofilter are adjusted at step 180. The adjustment is<br>
based on the measured amounts of infusion and removed ultrafittrate in the infusion<br>
system and  a predetermined desired pressure differential between  the infusion and<br>
removed ultrafiltrates.   The method 170 may be repeated 182 until the desired infusion<br>
10      ultrafiltrate is delivered or removed from the patient.<br>
While the particular infusion systems and methods as herein shown and disclosed<br>
in detail are fully capable of performing as indicated and providing the advantages herein<br>
before stated, it is to be understood that they are merely illustrative of the presently<br>
preferred embodiments of the invention, and that no limitations are intended to the details<br>
