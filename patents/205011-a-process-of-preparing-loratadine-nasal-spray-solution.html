A PROCESS OF PREPARING LORATADINE NASAL SPRAY SOLUTION<br>
M/S. ALEMBIC LIMITED, ALEMBIC ROAD, VADODARA- 390 003, GUJARAT, an Indian Company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956.<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention, and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
This invention relates to a process of preparing loratadine nasal spray solution-More particularly this invention relates to a process of preparing loratadine nasal spray solution for the treatment of allegic rhinitis by making the drug loratadine available at the site of action in the form of nasal spray to provide relief from symptoms with a reduced dosage as compared to oral therapy thereby lesser quantity of drug is required to elicit a pharmaceutical response without any side effects.<br>
Allergic Rhinitis, affects a number of people and the cause of the same are many.<br>
Oral therapy with antihistamine drugs is well known and Loratadine belongs to the class of new antihistaminic drugs which is currently used in oral therapy and is available in the form of Syrup and Tablets but in the oral therapy the relief from the symptoms is slow and the side effects like headache and eye pain is also associated and the quantity of drug required to elicit a pharmaceutical response is high.<br>
Treatment of allergic rhinitis is symptomatic and therefore a rapid relief from symptoms is desirable.<br>
The present invention consists of a pharmaceutical composition where by the drug Loratadine also known as ethyl 4-18-chloro-5,6-dihydro-l 1 H benzo [5,6] cyclohepta [1,2-b]pyridin-l1-ylidene)-l-piperidinecarboxylate can be made available at the site of action in the form of a Nasal Spray which provides rapid relief from symptoms with lesser quantity of drug is required to elicit a pharmaceutical response and thus reduced dosage as compared to oral therapy and freedom from side effects like headache and eye pain associated with oral therapy and return to normalcy from the time symptoms appear is very fast thus increases work efficiency and reduces days away from work.<br>
