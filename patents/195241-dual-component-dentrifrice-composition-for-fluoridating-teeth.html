				<td>                         DUAL COMPONENT DENTIFRICE COMPOSITION <br>
                                      FOR FLUORIDATING TEETH <br>
                                       Background Of The Invention<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention is relates to a process for preparing  dentifrice composition containing acidulated fluoride compounds effective as anticaries agents and more particularly to an acidulated phosphate fluoride dual component dentifrice composition for fluoridating teeth.<br>
2.	The Prior Art<br>
It has long been known to include fluoride containing compounds in dentifrices as anticaries agents, and it has been established that these compounds are effective to reduce the incidence of dental caries. Fluoride compounds which are deemed to be the most effective are sodium fluoride, sodium monofluorophosphate and stannous fluoride. The fluoride compounds are effective mainly due to the fluoride ions which improve the acid resistance of tooth enamel and accelerate remineralization (i.e. recalcification) of decayed teeth in their early stage when the decalcification has proceeded only slightly. The effect of improving the acid resistance of the enamel is believed to be due to the fact that the fluoride ions are incorporated into a crystal lattice of hydroxy apatite which is the main constituent of tooth enamel or, in other words, fluoride ions partially fluoridate hydroxy apatite and simultaneously repair the lattice irregularities.<br>
The effectiveness of fluoride treatment in providing acid resistance to tooth enamel is dependent upon the amount of fluoride ion which is available for deposition on the enamel being treated. Also, using phosphate buffered NaF, the incorporation of fluoride as CaF2 into dental enamel is facilitated at lower pH levels which increase enamel solubility. Prencipe et<br>
al., Colloid &amp; Surface Chemistry. 4"' Chemical Congress of America. NY (Aug. 25-30, 1991). It is. therefore, desirable to formulate an acidulated phosphate fluoride dentifrice to enhance fluoride deposition onto and uptake into the tooth enamel.<br>
Acidulated phosphate fluoride is disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,080.440 and 5.603,992 as delivered in a dual component dentifrice comprised of a separately housed first acidic component containing a fluoride salt such as NaF, which with a second separately housed cationic calcium ion containing component, forms the two component dentifrice for tooth remineralization. While these two separately housed component formulations avoid any reactions between ingredients within the first and second components, a reaction occurs within the first component between the acid, sodium fluoride and silica abrasive, reducing the bioavailability of the fluoride ion. Although amorphous silica, generally used as an abrasive ingredient in dentifrices is one of the most chemically inert abrasives available, the negatively charged oxygen atoms of the silica are protonated in the acid environment, and the resulting hydroxy! (OH) moieties hydrogen bond to the available fluoride ions released from sodium fluoride. This fluoride-OH bond occurs in the acidulated phosphate fluoride silica abrasive systems disclosed in prior art Patents 4,080,440, and 5603,992 whereby, the availability of the fluoride ions present in the dentifrice to fluoridate the enamel upon application thereto is significantly reduced. The magnitude of this reduction in available fluoride is hereinafter demonstrated.<br>
Thus,   there   is   a   clear  need   to   formulate   a   stable,   acidulated phosphate fluoride dentifrice, having the maximum deliverable fluoride.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is provided a method for the fluoridation of tooth enamel using a multicomponent dentifrice comprised of two separately housed, semi-solid aqueous components; the first component containing sodium fluoride as a source of fluoride ions, in an orally acceptable vehicle having a pH of at least about 7.5 and. the second component containing both a source of phosphate ions and an acid<br>
to provide pH of from about 2.5 to about 5.0, in an orally acceptable vehicle; each component containing a siliceous abrasive, whereby upon mixing of the components, a mixture having a pH of from about 4.0 to about 6.0 is formed, whereby upon application of the mixture to the teeth, the availability of fluoride ions is enhanced.<br>
There has been no recognition in the prior art of the significant loss of fluoride availability during extended periods of storage, resulting from the interaction of generally inert silica abrasives, with sodium fluoride, when NaF is present as the fluoride source in dentifrices having an acid environment. In accordance with the present invention, as will be further demonstrated herein, the enhanced fluoride availability resulting from separating the acid and the fluoride in separate dentifrice components, each containing a silica abrasive, is unexpected and significant.<br>
Accordingly, the instant invention provides for a method for preparing dentrifice composition comprising the steps of:<br>
preparing a first dentifrice component containing sodium fluoride as the fluoridation source and having a pH of at least 7.5, and a second dentifrice component containing a source of phosphate ions and an acid in an amount sufficient to maintain the pH in the range of 2.5 to 5.0; both dentifrice components containing a siliceous abrasive;<br>
mixing the first and second components together to form a mixture having a pH of<br>
4.0 to 6.0 to enhance the availability of fluoride ions to tooth enamel on application of the<br>
mixture to the teeth.	 <br>

The resultant product is in the case of each component is a homogeneous, semi-solid, extrudable paste product.<br>
Packaging of the Dentifrice<br>

The following example is further illustrative the present invention, but it is understood that the invention is not limited thereto. All amounts and proportions referred to herein and in the appended claims are by weight, unless otherwise stated.<br>
Example<br>
A two component dentifrice of the present invention was prepared, designated Toothpaste I, having a first sodium fluoride and silica abrasive containing component and a second acid phosphate and silica abrasive containing component. The ingredients and pH of each of the two components of Toothpaste I are itemized in Table I, below.<br>
Table I Toothpaste 1 <br>
(Table Removed)<br>
*Contains potentially  5000 ppm releasable V  with combination of 1"  and 2" components upon admixing prior to application to the denature.<br>
To determine the fluoride ion availability of the multicomponent dentifrice of the present invention, after storage for a period of 8 weeks, the 1"' and 2nrt components of Toothpaste I were mixed together, diluted one-thousand times using a commercially available buffering solution (Orion TISAB II), at ambient room temperature; the available fluoride ion concentration was determined using a Corning Model 350 pH/ion Analyzer, Corning Inc., Corning N.Y, equipped with a Orion Fluoride Electrode. Model #94-09, Orion Research Products, Boston, Mass. The EMF output from the Orion Fluoride Electrode was converted to ppm fluoride by means of a logarithmic-linear calibration established with known concentrations of fluoride in the buffering solution and the resultant ppm of available fluoride determined has been recorded in Table III, below.<br>
For purposes of comparison, the procedure was repeated except the dentifrice assayed for fluoride availability was a single component acidulated phosphate fluoride dentifrice of the prior art, containing a silica abrasive designated. Toothpaste II, having the ingredients and pH listed in Table II, below. Referring to Table II, note that the amount of sodium fluoride within Toothpaste II is one-half that of the 1" Component of Toothpaste I, so that a comparable potential 5,000 ppm of fluoride would be delivered upon use by each. After a comparable eight weeks of storage, the available soluble fluoride of Toothpaste II was assayed using the same methodology as that used for Toothpaste I and the results are also recorded in Table III. below.<br>
Table 11 Toothpaste II  (Table Removed)<br>
Table HI Fluoride Availability  (Table Removed)<br>
Referring to Table III, the 4,900 ppm is equivalent to 98% availability of the fluoride in Toothpaste I and the 3.800 ppm is correspondingly equivalent to 76% fluoride availability in Toothpaste II. The 22% difference in  available fluoride between Toothpaste   I   of the  present invention and<br>
comparative Toothpaste II is significant and unexpectedly large. The magnitude of the loss of available fluoride in Toothpaste II is at a level of significance rendering Toothpaste II commercially unacceptable.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
