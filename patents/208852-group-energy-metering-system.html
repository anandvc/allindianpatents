FIELD OF INVENTION: -<br>
The Invention describes Group Energy Metering System. The conventional<br>
system of measurement of Electrical Energy is individual metering i.e.<br>
individual Energy Meter being provided to each consumer. The Meter is to<br>
record electrical energy consumption for individual consumer exclusively.<br>
The installation in case of single phase supply is carried out by connecting<br>
phase &amp; neutral of mains supply to corresponding terminals in the meter<br>
terminal block (i.e. Supply Side). The load of the consumer is connected from<br>
the load side of terminal block in the same manner i.e. Phase &amp; Neutral<br>
outgoing. Similarly for 3 phase supply system, i.e. 3 phases &amp; neutral are<br>
connected to the incoming side terminal of the meter and corresponding 3<br>
phases &amp; neutral available in the outgoing terminals are connected to the<br>
load of the consumer.<br>
PRIOR ART:-<br>
l)ue to passage of time, the dwelling pattern has changed from individual<br>
houses to "Residential Flats". Now-a-days even small scale manufacturing &amp;<br>
service industries are operating at "Flatted Factories". Thus it is obvious that<br>
there are large number of individual customers in one premises now. So<br>
with the existing system of metering the incoming supply cables (phases &amp;<br>
neutral) are to be connected separately to each and every meter and<br>
outgoing cables to the consumer load individually.<br>
This makes the cabling system very lengthy, clumsy, jumbled up,<br>
cumbersome. Fig. 1 &amp; 2 respectively show an example of existing layout for<br>
4 nos. of Single Phase and 4 nos. of Three Phase Meter installation &amp; its<br>
complexicity. Even physical placement of Energy Meters becomes difficult<br>
due to lack of available space.<br>
Problem With Prior Art:-<br>
1. Space requirement will be high due to installation of so many<br>
individual meters. Most houses and factory units do not have enough<br>
space to accommodate multiple meters &amp; its wiring.<br>
2. Jumbling of cables for large number of connections.<br>
3. The system is unsafe. Often open cable joints can be seen.<br>
4. The connections become untidy because of so many cables.<br>
5. Identification of particular cable for repair / replacement becomes<br>
difficult because of so many wires.<br>
6. Occasionally it can cause hazard due to birds or lizards etc.<br>
7. Pilferage becomes easy due to open wiring. The whole metering setup<br>
is open to tampering.<br>
How this invention seeks to solve the problems:-<br>
The invention relates to a group energy metering system wherein a number<br>
of users can be metered from one group metering of multiple number of<br>
consumers.<br>
In this design a group metering will register energy consumption of one or<br>
multi number of consumers. The input of power is at one place, which will<br>
feed supplies to all the individual units and register the consumption of<br>
energy for each consumer. For registration of energy consumption separate<br>
display or a common display is provided to display the consumption of<br>
individual unit one after the other in a sequential order.<br>
The invented design concept is shown in fig 3, fig 4 and fig 5 for Single<br>
Phase, Three Phase or combination of single phase and three phase system<br>
respectively, housing multi numbers of individual meters inside.<br>
Objects of the present invention are:<br>
1. It is with an object to provide Group Metering in one meter.<br>
2. The group energy metering system will eliminate jumbling up of<br>
cables.<br>
3. External wiring drastically reduced &amp; connection streamlined.<br>
4. Sizeable reduction of space on providing Group Metering in one Meter<br>
instead of each individual meter separately.<br>
5. An improved system of metering as in the system, the incoming<br>
terminal is common or separate depending on use. Terminals for<br>
outgoing connections are marked separately.<br>
6. The system will be free from the risk of bird &amp; lizard etc.<br>
7. Reversal of load connection is eliminated.<br>
This Group Energy Metering System according to the present invention, is<br>
very convenient, space saving, tamper proof and easy for installation &amp;<br>
maintenance.<br>
Since many apparently different embodiments of the present invention<br>
could be made without departing from scope and spirit thereof, it is<br>
intended that the description of the invention stated herein be interpreted as<br>
being illustrative only and not limiting in any manner whatsoever.<br>
FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION:-<br>
Group energy metering system can have following arrangements, as<br>
required:<br>
(i) One I oint Unit:-<br>
Refer l'ig-6, Comprising of measurement unit &amp; display unit<br>
combined together.<br>
(ii) Two Separate Individual Units:-<br>
Refer Fig-7, Comprising of individual measurement unit &amp; display<br>
unit separately.<br>
The functional description is as under:<br>
Measurement Unit<br>
The measurement unit electronics is broadly divided into three sections<br>
namely:<br>
1) Power Supply Section<br>
2) Energy Measurement Section<br>
3) Controller Section<br>
Power Supply Section<br>
This section takes mains supply from the incoming bus bar to generate<br>
ripple free low voltage DC to cater to the requirement of both measurement<br>
unit and display unit. It employs very good quality transformer, bridge<br>
rectifier, voltage regulator and necessary filter circuit to achieve the goal.<br>
Suitable X 2 -type capacitor and MOV protects the total system from sudden<br>
appearance of high voltage and surges in the incoming mains supply.<br>
Energy Measurement Section<br>
This section measures power consumption of 2 numbers or more of<br>
consumers individually.<br>
The electrical energy delivered to consumer's load is passed through the<br>
primary of a C.'T or a shunt, which produces scaled down voltage,<br>
proportionate to consumer current, across the designed circuitry. This<br>
provides current signal.<br>
The voltage signal appearing between line and neutral is scaled down to<br>
produce suitable voltage using potential divider method. This provides<br>
voltage signal.<br>
Now these signals are fed to energy measurement ASIC. Inside ASIC<br>
these signals are converted to digital signal by ADC and then<br>
multiplied to derive instantaneous power. The instantaneous power is<br>
integrated over a time to arrive at corresponding energy value.<br>
In this technique of power measurement, except for ADC section all other<br>
signal processing are carried in the digital domain. This approach provides<br>
superior stability and accuracy over extremes in environment condition and<br>
over time.<br>
The ASIC gives instantaneous active power information which is used for<br>
meter calibration. It also provides average active power information which is<br>
being used by the controller section for calculating KWh, MD etc.<br>
Controller Section<br>
This section, on receipt of active power information from measurement<br>
section, calculates kWh, MD etc. It uses latest state of the art micro controller<br>
a long with very powerful CPLD, logic circuitry, FRAM (extremely long life<br>
memory), R'l'C with Li-primary battery and RS-232 (serial ports). The<br>
processed data is sent to display unit using one serial port. Another serial<br>
port is provided for data downloading using MRI.<br>
Display Unit<br>
This is a separate micro -controller based unit with display driver, LCD -<br>
glass, serial ports and associated electronics.<br>
The signal received from the measurement unit through serial port is<br>
processed to display kWh, MD, Date, Time etc in a scrolling fashion in the<br>
LCD. The LCD is having 2 or more rows of multi digits multi segment<br>
displays to display individual kWh, MD alongwith current date and time in<br>
a automatically/manual scrolling mode. The other serial port is for data<br>
down loading using MRI.<br>
Statement of invention:-<br>
Accordingly the invention describes Group Energy Metering System for<br>
metering of multi number of meters where outgoing terminals are marked<br>
separately and incoming terminals are common. The system is applicable for<br>
Electronic kWh Type, Trivector Type with AMR facilities. The invention<br>
totally eliminates the scope of power pilferage as there is no existence of<br>
incoming terminal block for individual meter. This eliminates the reversal of<br>
load connection.<br>
The group energy metering system is having one common Terminal Block<br>
lor input Power Supply to the system. The supply to individual customer<br>
load is from physically separated properly earmarked (for each customer)<br>
Terminal Block having provision for connection of customer load (1 Ph, 3 Ph<br>
or combination of 1 Ph &amp; 3 Ph). The consumer supply can be routed directly<br>
or through Latching Relay for connection or disconnection of load as<br>
required. Hence the scope of manipulation with input supply and load<br>
supply connection terminals is totally ruled out. Thus the invention<br>
completely stops pilferage of power.<br>
For single phase connection, number of cables on the incoming side is only<br>
one cable of 2 core for single phase &amp; similarly one cable of 3 core / 4 core<br>
for 3 phase connection for multi meters.<br>
The group energy metering system has other distinct features as under:<br>
-Common mains supply to the system can be Single Phase (Phase &amp; Neutral)<br>
or Three Phase (3 phase, 4 wire/3 phase, 3 wire)<br>
-Energy supply to consumer load can be Single Phase, Three Phase or<br>
combination of Single &amp; Three Phase.<br>
-The System developed using the concept of split metering i.e. Energy<br>
Measurement Unit &amp; Display Unit for energy registration etc are two<br>
individual units which can be arranged jointly combined or separately.<br>
Interconnection between these two units can be wired using serial<br>
communication cable or wireless using RF communication technology.<br>
-The Energy Measurement unit is having micro controller based state of the<br>
art DATA CONCENTRATOR. Data received from measurement section for<br>
all meters are processed and concentrated at one point for subsequent<br>
requirement.<br>
-System is with facility for data downloading via wired serial<br>
communication from measurement unit or display unit using MRI.<br>
-Data downloading can be carried out wireless using<br>
GSM/CDMA/PLCC/RF communication.<br>
-Power can be supplied to individual consumer using suitable Latching<br>
Relay. This enables connecting or disconnecting the consumer load by giving<br>
command through GSM/CDMA/PLCC/RF communication remotely as<br>
required.<br>
-GSM/CDMA/PLCC/RF communication system can be an integral part of<br>
system or it can be separate.<br>
-Display Unit is capable of showing different parameters of all the meters<br>
simultaneously (i.e. for example : if the unit has 10 meters, the display will<br>
show 10 individual meter data simultaneously).<br>
-Display can show measured parameters of all the meters, one consumer at a<br>
time in auto/ manual scrolling fashion.<br>
- The group energy metering system is housed in Engineering plastic cover<br>
to provide protection against electric shock<br><br><br><br>
