[Title of the Invention] AIR CLEANER DEVICE FOR SADDLE-RIDE<br>
TYPE VEHICLE<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to air cleaner devices for saddle-ride type vehicles such as motorcycles. [Background Art] [0002]<br>
In the past, there has been an air cleaner device for a saddle-ride type vehicle in which the inner space of an air cleaner case is divided into a dirty side on an intake hole side and a clean side on an engine side with an air cleaner element housed and held in the air cleaner case as a boundary and on the dirty side a separator provided in the air cleaner case defines a first flow path on the intake hole side and a second flow path on the air cleaner element side which is curved and communicated with the first flow path (for example, see Patent Document 1) . Formation of the curved flow path on the dirty side of the air cleaner case is intended to reduce the possibility that water, sand or the like which has entered the case together with air reaches the air cleaner element. [Patent Document 1] JP-A No. H8-135528 [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problem to be Solved by the Invention] [0003]<br>
In   the above related art structure, since the<br><br>
separator is a flat plate and approximately half thereof is disposed adjacent to the air cleaner element, the flow path in that region is narrow and the actually available area of the air cleaner element is small, so it is difficult to take in air efficiently.<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to ensure that in an air cleaner device for a saddle-ride type vehicle, equipped with a separator for defining a curved flow path on the dirty side of the air cleaner case, the intake air flow path just before the air cleaner element is widened to take in air efficiently. [Means for Solving the Problem] [0004]<br>
As a solution to the above problem, the invention as described in Claim 1 is characterized in that in an air cleaner device (for example, an air cleaner box 28 in an embodiment) for a saddle-ride type vehicle (for example, a motorcycle 1 in the embodiment) in which an inner space of an air cleaner case (for example, an air cleaner case 71 in the embodiment) is divided into a dirty side on an intake hole (for example, an intake hole 78 in the embodiment) side and a clean side on an engine (for example, an engine 22 in the embodiment) side with an air cleaner element (for example, an  air  cleaner  element E in the embodiment) housed and held in the air cleaner case as a boundary, and on the dirty side, a separator (for example, a separator 95 in the embodiment) provided in the air cleaner case defines a first flow path (for example, an intake air inlet path 91<br><br>
in the embodiment) on the intake hole side and a second flow path (for example, a right inner space 93 in the embodiment) on the air cleaner element side which is curved and communicated with the first flow path, the separator has a flange (for example, a short flange 95a in the embodiment) along a flat reference plane (for example, a reference plane K in the embodiment) on its periphery and the flange is coupled to, and supported on, the air cleaner case, and the separator is protruded toward the first flow path with respect to the reference plane in order to widen the second flow path.<br>
The saddle-ride type vehicle conceptually includes all vehicles in which a rider straddles the body and also conceptually includes not only motorcycles (including motorized bicycles) but also three-wheeled or four-wheeled vehicles and scooter type vehicles with a low-floor foot rest. [0005]<br>
The invention as described in Claim 2 is characterized in that the first flow path's wall (for example, an outer wall 84 in the embodiment) opposite to the separator is protruded outward of the air cleaner case in a manner to suit the protrusion of the separator. [Effect of the Invention] [0006]<br>
According to the invention as described in Claim 1, while the periphery of the separator is coupled to, and supported on, the air cleaner case along the flat reference<br><br>
plane/ the separator is protruded toward the first flow path (opposite to the air cleaner element) with respect to the reference plane, so that the intake air flow path (second flow path) just before the air cleaner element is widened without deviating from the existing structure and thus the whole air cleaner element is made uniformly available and air can be taken in efficiently. [0007]<br>
According to the invention as described in Claim 2, since the separator has a portion protruded toward the first flow path and the air cleaner case's wall opposite to the separator is protruded outward of the case, the first flow path has an adequate volume and also the second flow path has an adequate volume so that air can be taken in more efficiently.<br>
[Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention] [0008]<br>
Next, an embodiment of the present invention will be described referring to drawings.  In the explanation given below, direction-related words such as "front", "rear (back)", "left", "right" mean the same directions as those for the vehicle unless otherwise specified.  In the drawings, arrow FR, arrow LH, and arrow UP represent frontward, leftward, and upward of the vehicle respectively. [0009]<br>
A scooter type motorcycle (scooter type vehicle) 1 shown in Figs. 1 and 2 has a front wheel 3 steered by a handlebar 2 and a rear wheel 4 driven by a swing unit 21.<br><br>
steering parts including the handlebar 2 and front wheel 3 are steerably pivoted on a head pipe 12 at the front end of a body frame 11.  The front lower part of the swing unit 21 is pivoted on the lower rear side of the body frame 11 in a vertically swingable manner. A relatively low straddling portion M is provided between the handlebar 2 and a saddle seat 5 for an occupant to sit on, which is supported in a rear upper position of the vehicle body.  Left and right floor steps 6 on which the feet of an occupant seated on the seat 5 rest are provided on the left and right sides of the straddling portion M. An upward convex or protruded center tunnel part CT extending longitudinally is provided between the left and right floor steps 6. [0010]<br>
The body frame 11, which is made by uniting different types of steel materials by welding or a similar method, mainly includes: the head pipe 12 located at its front end; a main frame 13 stretching obliquely downward and rearward from the head pipe 12, then curving rearward at the front lower side of the vehicle body; a cross frame 14 extending transversely at the lower rear side of the vehicle body with its transverse center portion joined to the rear end of the main frame 13; left and right rear frames 15 extending obliquely upward and rearward from the left and right lateral sides of the cross frame 14, then curving rearward at the rear upper side of the vehicle body; left and right pivot brackets 16 joined to the left and right lateral sides of the cross frame 14; and left and right<br><br>
gusset pipes 17 extending from the lower part of the main frame 13 toward the front parts of the left and right rear frames 15.  Left and right gusset coupling brackets 18 for coupling the rear ends of the left and right gusset pipes 17 are joined to the front part of the left and right rear frames 15 respectively. [0011]<br>
The swing unit 21 is a swing-type power unit which combines an engine 22, located in a front part thereof, and a power transmission mechanism 23, located in a rear left part thereof where the front part is supported by the left and right pivot brackets 16 through a suspension link 16a in a vertically swingable manner. A rear cushion 7 is disposed between the rear part of the power transmission mechanism 23 and the rear parts of the rear frames 15, thereby constituting a unit swing type rear suspension at the rear of the vehicle body. [0012]<br>
The engine 22 (internal combustion) is a water-cooled single-cylinder engine with a crankshaft (not shown) lying along the transverse direction (body width direction) where a cylinder 26 protrudes forward from the front end of the crankcase 25 almost horizontally (specifically its front part stretches slightly upward).  The front of the transmission case 24 of the power transmission mechanism 23 extending rearward is provided integrally on the left side of the crankcase 25.  In the figures, CI represents the rotation center axis line of the crankshaft (crank axis<br><br>
line) and C2 represents the center axis line of the<br>
cylinder 26 (cylinder axis line).<br>
[0013]<br>
The power transmission mechanism 23 has, for example, a belt type continuously variable transmission and a reduction gear which decelerates the output of the continuously variable transmission and transmits it to a rear wheel axle 4a (both not shown).  The belt type continuously variable transmission is housed in the transmission case 24 longitudinally across it and the reduction gear is housed in a gear case 24a connected to the rear end of the transmission case 24.  The rear wheel axle 4a protrudes rightward (toward the center of the vehicle body) on the rear right side of the gear case 24a and the rear wheel 4 is supported on the rear wheel axle 4a. The rotational power of the cran]<shaft is transmitted through the power transmission mechanism to rear wheel axle drive and run motorcycle></shaft>
Also referring to Fig. 3 , the cylinder 26 mainly includes: a cylinder body 26a fitted to the front end of the crankcase 25; a cylinder head 26b fitted to the front end of the cylinder body 26a; and a head cover 26c fitted to the front end of the cylinder head 26b.<br>
A throttle body 27 which forms an intake air path stretching almost horizontally and longitudinally is located just above the cylinder body 26a and the front end<br><br>
(downstream side) of the throttle body 27 is coupled to an intake port at the upper part of the cylinder head 26b through a downward curved insulator 27a.  An injector 27b (fuel injection valve) is attached to the curved periphery of the insulator 27a. [0015]<br>
An air cleaner box 28 is disposed behind the throttle body 27 and a connecting tube 28a stretching forward from the air cleaner box 28 is coupled to the rear end (upstream side) of the throttle body 27.<br>
An exhaust pipe 29 stretches downward from an exhaust port on the bottom of the cylinder head 26b, and the exhaust pipe 29, stretching rearward and curving appropriately below the engine 22, is coupled to a silencer 29a located on the right of the rear wheel 4. [0016]<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, the motorcycle 1 Includes: a front cover 31 covering the head pipe 12 and its surroundings from ahead; left and right front side covers 32 connected to the lower ends of the left and right lateral sides of the front cover 31; left and right floor front covers 33 connected to the lower ends of the left and right front side covers 32; left and right floor side covers 34 connected to the rear ends of the left and right floor front covers 33; a front inner cover 35 covering the head pipe 12 and its surroundings from behind; a center front cover 36 connected to the bottom of the front inner cover 35, forming the front upper face of the center tunnel<br><br>
part CT of the straddling portion M; a center rear cover 37 connected to the rear of the center front cover 36, forming the rear upper face of the center tunnel part CT; left and right center side covers 38 connected to the lower ends of the left and right lateral sides of the center front cover 36 and center rear cover 37, forming the left and right side faces of the center tunnel part CT; and left and right rear side covers 39 covering the rear upper parts of the left and right rear frames 11 and their surroundings laterally.  The covers 31 to 39 are mainly made of synthetic resin. [0017]<br>
Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, a fuel tank 45 for storing fuel for the engine 22 is disposed inside the rear part (lower part) of the center tunnel part CT and a reservoir tank 46 of a radiator (not shown) for cooling the engine 22 is disposed inside the longitudinal middle of the center tunnel part CT and above the front part of the fuel tank 45.<br>
The front part of the center rear cover 37 is constituted as a lid 47 which can turn (open/close) through a hinge shaft 47a located at the longitudinal middle of the center rear cover 37.  In a concave space which is opened or closed with the lid 47, a filler hole of the fuel tank 45 and a water feed hole of the reservoir tank 46 are disposed and these can be accessed when necessary by opening and closing the lid 47. [0018]<br><br>
The seat 5, supported above a curved wall 37a standing on the rear part of the center rear cover 37 and the left and right rear side covers 39, has a rider seat as its front half and a pillion passenger seat as its rear half which are united.  The lower edge of the seat 5 forms a straight line tilted up rearward when viewed laterally, and the virtually horizontal upper face (seating surface 5b) of the pillion passenger seat is slightly above the virtually horizontal upper face (seating surface 5a) of the rider seat.  In other words, the whole seat 5 is slightly tilted up rearward. [0019]<br>
A goods storage box 61 which can store goods such as a helmet H is provided below the seat 5 in a region surrounded by the curved wall 37a of the center rear cover 37 and the left and right rear side covers 39.  The goods storage box 61, made of synthetic resin, is a box with an opening at the top and supported by the covers 37 and 39, body frame 11 and so on appropriately.  The front end of the seat 5 is turnably fitted to the front end of the goods storage box 61 through a hinge shaft 5c lying transversely. As the seat 5 turns on the hinge shaft 5c, the top opening 61a of the goods storage box 61 opens or closes. [0020]<br>
When the seat 5 closes the top opening 61a of the goods storage box 61 (closed state) , the rear end of the seat 5 engages with a lock mechanism (not shown) located at the rear end of the goods storage box 61, so that the seat<br><br>
5 locks the top opening 61a of the goods storage box 61 in the closed state and the seating surfaces 5a and 5b become almost horizontal, permitting occupants to sit thereon.  On the other hand, by following a prescribed procedure of unlocking the lock mechanism, the seat 5 in the closed state can turn on the hinge shaft 5c in a way that its rear end swings up, making it possible to open the top opening 61a of the goods storage box 61. [0021]<br>
The upper edge (top opening 61a) of the goods storage box 61 stretches along the lower edge of the seat 5, forming a straight line tilted up rearward when viewed laterally.  On the other hand, a bottom wall 61b (see Figs. 3 and 10) of the goods storage box 61 forms a straight line a bit steeper than the upper edge when viewed laterally. In other words, the entire goods storage box 61 is slightly tilted up rearward with the front part deeper than the other parts. [0022]<br>
Figs. 1 to 3 show that a so-called jet helmet H for covering the top, temporal regions and back of the head of an occupant is housed in the front part of the goods storage box 61. As shown in Figs. 3 and 10, concaves 61c expanding downward are formed on the left and right sides of the front part of the bottom wall 61b so that the lower lateral parts of the jet helmet H can fit therein.  This ensures that the depth of the front part of the goods storage box 61 is increased as necessary to house the jet<br><br>
helmet H and a clearance from suction-related components located below and between the left and right concaves 61c, such as the throttle body 27, is obtained. [0023]<br>
Also referring to Fig. 11, a retractable partition 62 is provided in the longitudinal middle of the goods storage box 61.  The partition 62 has the shape of a plate virtually perpendicular to the longitudinal direction and looks almost square when viewed frontally.  A convex 61d in the shape of a rectangular parallelepiped is formed in the longitudinal middle of the bottom wall 61b of the goods storage box 61 and leg parts 62a are formed on the lower left and right parts of the partition 62 in a way to stride over the convex 61d.  A transversely protruding turning shaft 62b is formed at the bottom of each leg 62a and the turning shaft 62b is held in a retaining groove 61e formed in the longitudinal middle of a transversely (left or right) inner wall of the goods storage box 61 in a way that it can move along the groove and turn. [0024]<br>
On the left and right outer edges of the partition 62, ribs 62c stretching along the outer edges are vertically placed, oriented transversely outward.  The lower portion of each rib 62c constitutes a locking piece 62d tilted from its upper portion and the entire partition 62 in a way that a portion thereof in a lower position is in a more forward position. On the other hand, in parallel with the locking piece 62d, a locking groove 61f into which it is detachably<br><br>
. '  inserted is formed in the longitudinal middle of each<br>
transversely inner wall of the goods storage box 61.  Here, the retaining groove 61e is located below and parallel to the locking groove 61f. [0025]<br>
When the partition 62 is virtually vertically placed upright in the longitudinal middle of the goods storage box 61 and divides the housing space of the goods storage box<br>
61	into a front part and a rear part (partitioning<br>
position) (see Fig. 11), the turning shaft 62b is held in a<br>
lower part of the retaining groove 61e and the locking<br>
pieces 62 are inserted in the upper parts of the locking<br>
grooves 61f.  Consequently, the partition 62 is fixed in<br>
the above partitioning position to prevent small articles<br>
housed in the rear part of the goods storage box 61 from<br>
moving forward due to inclination of the bottom wall 61b,<br>
etc. so that large and small articles can be stored orderly.<br>
[0026]<br>
On the other hand, by lifting the partition 62 in the partitioning position obliquely upward and rearward along the retaining groove 61e and locking grooves 61f and pulling the locking pieces 62d off the locking grooves 61f (see Fig. 12), the partition 62 can be turned down rearward around the turning shaft 62b which has moved to a higher position in the retaining groove 61e. When the partition<br>
62	is fallen almost parallel to the bottom wall 61b (folded<br>
as indicated by chain line in Fig. 12), the front and rear<br>
parts of the housing space of the goods storage box 61<br><br>
communicate with each other so that a long article can be longitudinally housed, stretching from the front end of the top opening 61a to its rear end. [0027]<br>
Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, longitudinally long notches are formed on the front lower sides of the left and right rear side covers 39, and left and right step brackets 64 for supporting left and right pillion steps 63 are provided in a way to fit the left and right notches respectively.  The left (right) step bracket 64 integrally has a base part 64a to fit the notch on the front lower side of the left (right) rear side cover 39 and a stay 64b tapered obliquely downward and rearward from the lower front side of the base part 64a.  The front and rear of the base part 64a are fixed on a bracket 15a provided on the rear frame 15 with bolts.  The stay 64b is provided so as to cover the throttle body 27 laterally. [0028]<br>
Referring to Figs. 4 to 6, the air cleaner box 28 mainly includes: a hollow box type air cleaner case 71; a thick plate-like air cleaner element E housed in the air cleaner case 71; and a cylindrical connecting tube 2Ba stretching from the air cleaner case 71 toward the throttle body 27. [0029]<br>
Made of synthetic resin, the air cleaner case 71 is divided into a case body 72 in a transversely inner position constituting the right part and a case cover in a<br><br>
r<br>
transversely outer position constituting the left part. The case body 72 and case cover 75 are open to each other on a division plane almost perpendicular to the transverse direction above the transmission case 24.  The opening end of the case body 72 has almost the same shape as that of the case cover 75 and they fit each other with the fringe of a frame G of the air cleaner element E between them.  In this condition, the case body 72 and case cover 75 are joined in a mutually detachable manner by fastening several points on the peripheries of their openings with screws or the like. [0030]<br>
The air cleaner element E is generally shaped like a thick plate by folding filter paper or nonwoven fabric like bellows and when viewed from above, it forms a longitudinally long rectangle and when it is upright and parallel to the division plane B, it is positioned so as to strive over the division plane B transversely.  The frame G, which has almost the same peripheral shape as the openings 72a and 75a of the case body 72 and case cover 75, is integrally provided on the periphery of the air cleaner element E and with the fringe of the frame G held between the opening ends of the case body 72 and case cover 75, the air cleaner element E is held upright as mentioned above in the air cleaner case 71. [0031]<br>
The connecting tube 28a is inserted and held at the front end of the case body 72 and air inside the case body<br><br>
72 is supplied through the connecting tube 28a to the throttle body 27.  On the other hand, an intake hole 78 is provided at the front end of the case cover 75 to enable outside air to be introduced through the intake hole 78 into the case cover 75.  The inner space of the air cleaner case 71 is divided into an upstream dirty side (left, case cover 75 side) and a downstream clean side (right, case body 72 side) with the air cleaner element E as a boundary. [0032]<br>
.In the case body 72, as compared to the body left part 73 in which the opening 72a, almost trapezoidal when viewed laterally, is formed, the body right part 74 is gradually tapered stretching rightward with its right end reaching right of the vehicle body center plane.  The body right part 74 is in a slightly forward position from the center of the longitudinal width of the body left part 73. The lower end of the body right part 74 protrudes slightly below the lower end of the opening 72a. [0033]<br>
The longitudinal middle portion of the connecting tube 28a is inserted and held in the vehicle body center position of the front wall of the body right part 74.  The connecting tube 28a is made of flexible material such as rubber and its front portion stretches forward along the vehicle body center plane with its front end opening reaching the rear end of the throttle body 27.  On the other hand, when viewed from above, the rear portion of the connecting tube 28a curves obliquely leftward and rearward<br><br>
in the case body 72 and when viewed laterally, it curves obliquely upward and rearward and again curves rearward with its rear end opening reaching the vicinity of the upper edge of the rear of the air cleaner element E in the vicinity of the upper end in the case body 72.  A breather hose 79a extending from the head cover 26c is connected to the front end right side of the body right part 74.  A drain port 79b for draining water, etc. in the case body 72 is provided at the rear end bottom (lower end) of the body left part 73. [0034]<br>
The case body 72 is fixedly supported on the transmission case 24 and in order to close the left opening 72a of the case  body 72, the case cover 75 is attached in a way to let its right opening 75a fit it.<br>
In the case cover 75, when viewed laterally, the cover left part 77 is one size smaller than the cover right part 76 in which the opening 75a is almost trapezoidal when viewed laterally.  In the cover left part 77, a tilted upper wall 81 which is tilted down forward is formed to reduce its top height. [0035]<br>
Also referring to Figs. 7 and 6, the cover left part 77 includes: the tilted upper wall 81; a back wall 82 tilted forward with respect to the vertical direction; a lower wall 83 stretching almost horizontally from the bottom of the bacJc wall 82; and an outer wall 84 which is convex arc-curved transversely outward.  The front end of<br><br>
the tilted upper wall 81 and the front end of the lower wall 83 are vertically spaced from each other and the intake hole 78 is formed between these front ends. [0036]<br>
Here, the lower edge 39a of the left rear side cover 39 is located above the cover left part 77 (see Fig. 3) and the tilted upper wall 81 is formed in the cover left part 77 in order to maintain a clearance from the lower edge 39a when the swing unit 21 swings up.  The tilting angle of the tilted upper wall 81 is set so that it is almost parallel to the lower edge 39a of the left rear side cover 39 when the swing unit 21 swings up and the clearance is maintained efficiently without affecting the capacity of the case cover 75. [0037]<br>
The intake hole 78 has the shape of a horizontally long rectangle which transversely stretches across the case cover 75 where its opening is along a tilted plane tilted forward with respect to the vertical direction, in a slightly forward position from the front ends of the tilted upper wall 81, lower wall 83 and outer wall 84.  The outer edge of the intake hole 78 is located transversely in a more outer position than the front end of the outer wall 84. An intake hole outer wall 85 and intake hole upper and lower walls 86 and 87 stretch rearward from the outer, upper and lower edges of the intake hole 78 and these are arranged so as to join the front parts of the outer wall 84, tilted upper wall 81 and lower wall 83 appropriately.<br><br>
. "   [0038]<br>
Inside the case cover 75, a middle wall 89, almost horizontal, extending continuously with the back of the intake hole upper wall 86 is vertically placed rightward (toward the case inside) from inside the outer wall 84. The middle wall 89 and intake hole upper wall 86 are in a vertically lower position than the vertical center of the case cover 75.  An intake hole lower wall 87 is located continuously with the front of the lower wall 83.  The middle wall 89's inner edge 89a, almost parallel to the longitudinal direction, is transversely almost in the same position as the lower wall 83's inner edge 83a almost parallel to the longitudinal direction. [0039]<br>
From the intake hole 78's inner edge in the vicinity of the opening 75a of the case cover 75, an intake hole inner wall 88, tilted so that a more rearward portion thereof is located transversely in a more outward position, stretches obliquely rearward and transversely outward.  The back of the intake hole inner wall 88 terminates transversely at the same point as the inner edge 89a of the middle wall 89.  The rear edge of the intake hole inner wall 88, almost parallel to the vertical direction, is represented by 88a. [0040]<br>
As shown in Fig. 9, a separator 95 which defines an intake air inlet path 91 extending rearward from the intake hole 78 in a lower position of the case cover 75 is<br><br>
provided in a rectangular area, longitudinally long when viewed laterally, which is surrounded by the rear edge 88a of the intake hole inner wall 88, the inner edge 89a of the middle wall 89, the inner edge 83a of the lower wall 83 (step from the lower wall of the cover right part 76), and the inner edge 82a of the back wall 82 (step from the back wall of the cover right part 76) . [0041]<br>
Also referring to Figs. 7 and 8, the separator 95 has a shape like a tray open rightward and on the periphery of its opening, a short flange 95a is provided continuously, abutting on the rear edge 88a of the intake hole inner wall 88, the inner edge 89a of the middle wall 89, the inner edge B3a of the lower wall 83, and the inner edge 82a of the back wall 82 from right (transversely inside) where the short flange 95a is joined to a corresponding edge by welding or a similar method.  In the separator 95, using a plane defined by the rear edge 88a of the intake hole inner wall 88, the inner edge 89a of the middle wall 89, the inner edge 83a of the lower wall 83, and the inner edge 82a of the back wall 82 as reference plane K, the short flange 95a is formed along the reference plane K. [0042]<br>
The curved top of the outer wall 84 of the case cover 75 is in a more rearward position than the longitudinal center of the case cover 75 where this position is the most transversely outward position of the case cover 75.  The back of the middle wall 89 is cut so as to terminate in the<br><br>
vicinity of the curved top of the outer wall 84.  The middle wall 89's rear edge, almost parallel to the transverse direction, is represented by 89b. [0043]<br>
This creates a communication hole 94 which is open upward in the rear part of the intake air inlet path 91 and through this communication hole 94, the intake air inlet path 91 communicates with an upper space 92 above it which is surrounded by the tilted upper wall 81, the back wall 82's upper part and the middle wall 89 and looks triangular when viewed laterally.  The upper space 92 communicates with a right inner space 93 formed in the cover right part 76 on the right thereof.  The right inner space 93 is arranged so as to spread across the right opening 75a of the case cover 75 and wider than the intake air inlet path 91 combined with the upper space 92 when viewed laterally. [0044]<br>
The air introduced through the intake hole 78 into the intake air inlet path 91 reaches the back of the case cover 75, then flows into the upper space 92 through the communication hole 94 and flows from the upper space 92 to the right inner space 93 on the right thereof and diffuses therein, and uniformly passes through the entire air cleaner element E in which it is filtered.  The filtered air is supplied from inside the case body 72 to the engine 22 through the connecting tube 28a, throttle body 27 and insulator 27a. [0045]<br><br>
Since an intake air path, curved several times in the area from the intake hole 78 to the air cleaner element E, is thus produced, substances with a larger gravity than air such as water and sand are caught at the rear end of the intake air inlet path 91 where the flow path curves upward, so that the possibility of clogging, etc. due to these substances reaching the air cleaner element E is reduced and high filtering performance of the air cleaner element E is maintained for a long time.  The water or other substance accumulated at the rear end of the intake air inlet path 91 is drained out of the case through the drain port 79b. [0046]<br>
The separator 95 includes: a curved wall 96 curved like an arc almost parallel to the outer wall 84; upper and lower walls 97 and 98 extending from the upper and lower edges of the curved wall 96 transversely inward and almost horizontally; and a back wall 99 extending from the rear edge of the curved wall 96 transversely inward and almost parallel to the transverse direction.  The short flange 95a continuously lies covering the front edge of the curved wall 96, the upper and lower walls 97 and 98 and the inner edge of the back wall 99. With the separator 95 installed, the curved wall 96 lies between the middle wall 89 and lower wall 83, the upper wall 97 abuts on the lower face of the middle wall 89, the lower wall 98 abuts on the upper face of the lower wall 83, and the back wall 99 abuts on the front face of the back wall 82.<br><br>
. '   [0047]<br>
Regarding the intake air inlet path 91, in an inlet portion surrounded by the intake hole upper and lower walls 86 and 87 and inner and outer walls 85 and 88, the transverse width is smaller at a more rearward position from the intake hole 78, and in a curved portion surrounded by the curved wall 96, outer wall 84, middle wall 89 and lower wall 83,   the path extends rearward with a virtually constant sectional shape.  In other words, the outer wall 84 protrudes leftward to the same extent as the separator 95 protrudes leftward, so that the flow path of the intake air inlet path 91 after the inlet portion does not become narrower. [0048]<br>
In addition, the curved wall 96 and outer wall 84 are convex arc-shaped on the outside of the case and thanks to this shape, their rigidity is increased and no reinforcement is required and suction noise is reduced. Also, since the separator 95 is protruded leftward, the outer wall 84 (curved wall 96) is more spaced from the air cleaner element E and the intake space (right inner space 93) just before the air cleaner element E is wide enough to take in air efficiently, leading to improvement in the output performance of the engine 22. [0049]<br>
As explained so far, in the air cleaner box 28 of the motorcycle 1 in the above embodiment, the inner space of the air cleaner case 71 is divided into a dirty side on the<br><br>
. *   intake hole 78 side and a clean side on the engine 22 side with the air cleaner element E housed and held in the air cleaner case 71 as a boundary and on the dirty side, the separator 95 provided in the air cleaner case 71 defines the intake air inlet path 91 on the intake hole 78 side and the right inner space 93 on the air cleaner element E side which is curved and communicated with the intake air inlet path 91, where the separator 95 has a short flange 95a along the flat reference plane K on its periphery and the short flange 95a is coupled to, and supported on, the air cleaner case 71, and the separator 95 is protruded toward the intake air inlet path 91 with respect to the reference plane K in order to widen the right inner space 93. [0050]<br>
In this structure, while the periphery of the separator 95 is coupled to, and supported on, the air cleaner case 71 along the flat reference plane K, the separator 95 is protruded toward the intake air inlet path 91 side (opposite to the air cleaner element E), so that the intake air path (right inner space 93) just before the air cleaner element E is widened without deviating from the existing structure and thus the whole air cleaner element E is made uniformly available to take in air efficiently. [0051]<br>
In the air cleaner box 28, the intake air inlet path 91's wall (outer wall 84) opposite to the separator 95 is protruded outward of the air cleaner case 71 (opposite to the separator 95) in a manner to suit the protrusion of the<br><br>
, '   separator 95, so that the intake air inlet path 91 is wide enough due to the separator protruded toward the intake air inlet path 91 and the right inner space 93 is also wide enough due to the outer wall 84 of the air cleaner case 71 protruded outward of the case, permitting air to be taken in more efficiently. [0052]<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above embodiment; for example, it is also possible that the air cleaner element is cylindrical or made of urethane foam. Also, the reference plane for the separator may be slightly curved or stepped.  It is needless to say that shape details of the air cleaner case or separator and the flow path structure in the air cleaner case may be modified in various ways without departing from the gist of the present invention.<br>
