				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to microlayered composites made<br>
from blends of elastomeric compositions and high barrier thermoplastic resins for use in air barriers, such as for tire innerliners. The invention also provides for processes to manufacture the microlayered composites such as through the use of microlayer coextrusion.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]	The coextrusion of sheets and other articles wherein individual<br>
layer thicknesses are on the order of microns is known. For example, Schrerik, W.J., Alfrey, T., Jr., Some Physical Properties of Multilayered Films, 9 POLYMER ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE, 393-99 (1969), and U.S. Pat Nos. 3,557,265, 3,565,985, 3,687,589, 3,759,647, 3,773,882,3,884,606, 5,094,793, 5,094,788, and 5,389,324 disclose devices and processes to prepare composites using coextruded thermoplastic polymeric materials having substantially uniform layer thicknesses. Microlayer coextrusion is to be distinguished from conventional multilayer coextrusion that typically involves the production of less than about fifteen layers. Such equipment and process have been applied in a variety of areas from adhesives to films. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,711,176, 6,379,791, 6,630,239, U.S. Pat. App. 2002/0132925, WO 00/76765 Al, and WO 00/15067 Al. However, such devices and processes have yet been applied to all areas where they may deliver desirable properties for their end use applications.<br>

Any reference to the "invention" may refer to one or more, but not necessarily all, of the inventions defined by the claims. References to specific "embodiments" are intended to correspond to claims covering those embodiments, but not necessarily to claims that cover more than those embodiments.<br>
[0032]	The term "phr" is parts per hundred rubber, and is a measure<br>
common in the art wherein components of a composition are measured relative to a major elastomer component, based upon 100 parts by weight of the elastomer or elastomers or based upon 100 parts by weight of the elastomer plus the secondary rubber, if included.<br>
[0033]	As used herein, in reference to Periodic Table "Groups", the new<br>
numbering scheme for the Periodic Table Groups are used as in HAWLEY'S CONDENSED CHEMICAL DICTIONARY 852 (13thed. 1997).<br><br>
[0034]	The term "elastomer(s)" or "elastomeric composition(s)" as used<br>
herein refers to any polymer or composition of polymers consistent with the ASTM D1566 definition. The terms may be used interchangeably with the term "rubber", as used herein.<br>
[0035]	As used herein, the term "alky!" refers to a paraffmic hydrocarbon<br>
group which may be derived from an alkane by dropping one or more hydrogens from the formula, such as, for example, a methyl group (CHa), or an ethyl group (CH3CH2), etc.<br>
[0036]	As used herein, the term  "alkenyl"  refers to  an unsaturated<br>

made from a plurality of layers, generally more than fifteen layers, that have thicknesses in the order from nanometers to microns.<br><br>
[0042]	As used herein, "high barrier thermoplastic resin(s)" refers to<br>
thermoplastics whose permeability is below that of the elastomer or elastomeric composition by a factor of from about 3 to about 1000.<br>
DETAILED DESC RIPTION Elastomer<br>
[0043]	The elastomeric compositions disclosed herein include at least one<br>
elastomer. In certain embodiments, the elastomer comprises €4 to Cj isoolefm derived units. These polymers are generally homopolymers or random copolymers of C4 to €7 isoolefm derived units. The €4 to €7 isoolefm derived units may be selected from isobutylene, isobutene, 2-methyl-l-butene, 3-methyl-1-butene, 2-methyl~2-butene, 1-butene, 2-butene, methyl vinyl ether, indene, vinyltrimethylsilane, hexene, and 4-methyl-l-pentene. Further, the elastomer may also comprise multiolefin derived units selected from isoprene, butadiene, 2,3-dimethy 1-1,3 -butadiene, myrcene, 6,6-dimethyl-fulvene, hexadiene, cyclopentadiene, arid piperylene. The elastomer may also comprise styrenic-derived units selected from styrene and substituted styrenes, non-limiting examples of which include chlorostyrene, methoxystyrene, indene and indene derivatives, ct-methylstyrene, o-methylstyrene, w-methylstyrene, and p-methylstyrene, and/&gt;tert-butylstyrene. The elastomer may also be halogenated.<br>
[0044]	The elastomer may also be a butyl-type rubber or branched butyl-<br>
type rubber, including halogenated versions of these elastomers. Useful elastomers are unsaturated butyl rubbers such as homopolymers and copolymers of olefins or isoolefms and multiolellns, or homopolymers of multiolefins. These and other types of elastomers suitable for the invention are well known and are described in RUBBER TECHNOLOGY 209-581 (Maurice Morton ed., Chapman &amp; Hall 1995), THE VANDERBILT RUBBER HANDBOOK 105-122 (Robert F. Ohm ed., R.T. Vanderbilt Co., Inc. 1990), and Edward Kresge and H.C. Wang in 8 KlRK-OTHMER ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY 934-955 (John Wiley &amp;<br><br><br>
Sons, Inc. 4th ed. 1993). Non-limiting examples of unsaturated elastomers useful in the method and composition are poly(isobutylene-co-isoprene), polyisoprene, polybutadiene, poly(styrene-co-butadiene), natural rubber, star-branched butyl rubber, and mixtures thereof. Useful elastomers may be made by any suitable means known in the art, and the invention is not herein limited by the method of producing the elastomer.<br>
[0045]	Butyl rubbers are prepared by reacting a mixture of monomers, the<br>
mixture having at least (1) a €4 to C? isoolefin monomer component such as isobutylene with (2) a multiolefin, monomer component. Typically, the isoolefin is in a range from 70 to 99.5 wt% by weight of the total monomer mixture in one embodiment, and 85 to 99.5 wt% in another embodiment. The multiolefin component is present in the monomer mixture from 30 to 0.5 wt%, alternatively 25 to 0.5 wt%, alternatively 20 to 0.5 wt%, alternatively 15 to 0.5 wt%, alternatively 10 to 0.5 wt% and alternatively 8 to 0.5 wt%.<br>
[0046]	The isoolefin is a €4 to Cy compound, non-limiting examples of<br>
which are compounds such as isobutylene, isobutene, 2-methyl-l-butene, 3-methyl-1-butene, 2-methyl-2-butene, 1-butene, 2-butene, methyl vinyl ether, indene, vinyltrimethylsilane, hexene, and 4-methyl-l-pentene. The multiolefin is a €4 to Cu multiolefin such as isoprene, butadiene, 2,3-dimethyl-l,3-butadiene, myrcene, 6,6-dimethyl-fulvene, hexadiene, cyclopentadiene, and piperylene, and other monomers such as disclosed in EP 0 279 456, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,506,316 and 5,162,425. Other polyrnerizable monomers such as styrene and dichlorostyrene are also suitable for homopolymerization or copolymerization in butyl rubbers. One embodiment of the butyl rubber polymer may be obtained by reacting 95 to 99.5 wt% of isobutylene with 0.5 to 8 wt% isoprene, alternatively 0.5 wt% to 5.0 wt% isoprene. Butyl rubbers and methods of their production are described in detail in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,356,128, 3,968,076, 4,474,924, 4,068,051 and 5,532,312.<br><br><br>
(Si<br>
[0047]	Suitable   butyl   rubbers   are   EXXON     BUTYL   Grades   of<br>
poly(isobutylene-co-isoprene), having a Mooney viscosity of 32 ± 2 to 51 ±5 (ML 1 + 8 at 125°C, ASTM D 1646). Another suitable butyl-type rubber is VISTANEX™ polyisobutylene rubber having a molecular weight viscosity average of 0.9 ± 0.15 x 106 to 2.11 ± 0.23 x 106. (ExxonMobil Chemical Co., Baytown, TX).<br>
[0048]	The butyl rubber may also be a branched or "star-branched" butyl<br>
rubber. These rubbers are described in, for example, EP 0 678 529 Bl, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,182,333 and 5,071,913. In one embodiment, the star-branched butyl rubber ("SBB") is a composition of a butyl rubber, either halogenated or not, and a polydiene or block copolymer, either halogenated or not. The invention is not limited by the method of forming the SBB. The polydienes/block copolymer, or branching agents (hereinafter "polydienes"), are typically cationically reactive and are present during the polymerization of the butyl or halogenated butyl rubber, or can be blended with the butyl rubber to form the SBB. The branching agent or polydiene can be any suitable branching agent, and the invention is not limited to the type of polydiene used to make the SBB.<br>
[0049]	The SBB is typically a composition of the butyl or halogenated<br>
butyl rubber as described above and a copolymer of a polydiene and a partially hydrogenated polydiene selected from the group including styrene, polybutadiene, polyisoprene, polypiperylene, natural rubber, styrene-butadiene rubber, ethylene-propylene-diene rubber (EPDM), ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR), styrene-butadiene-styrene and styrene-isoprene-styrene block copolymers.

[0069]	In certain embodiments, rubbers of ethylene and propylene derived<br>
units such as EPR and EPDM are also suitable as secondary rubbers. Examples of suitable comonomers in making EPDM are ethylidene norbornene, 1,4-hexadiene, dicyclopentadiene, as well as others. These rubbers are described in RUBBER<br>
TECHNOLOGY   260-283   (1995).      A   suitable   ethylene-propylene   rubber   is<br>
® commercially available as VISTALON   (ExxonMobil Chemical Company).<br>
[0070]	The secondary rubber may also be a halogenated rubber as part of<br>
the elastomeric composition. The halogenated butyl rubber may be a brominated butyl rubber or a chlorinated butyl rubber. General properties and processing of halogenated butyl rubbers are described in THE VANDERBILT RUBBER HANDBOOK 105-122 (Robert F. Ohm ed., R.T. Vanderbilt Co., Inc. 1990), and in RUBBER TECHNOLOGY 311-321 (1995). Butyl rubbers, halogenated butyl rubbers, and star-branched butyl rubbers are described by Edward Kresge and H.C. Wang in 8<br>

Elastomeric Composition<br>
[0072]	The elastomeric compositions of the invention may be prepared by<br>
using conventional mixing or blending techniques including, for example, kneading, roller milling, extruder mixing, internal mixing (such as with a Banbury™ or Brabender™ mixer) etc. The sequence of mixing and temperatures employed are well known to the skilled rubber compounder, the objective being the dispersion of fillers, activators and curatives in the polymer matrix without excessive heat buildup. A useful mixing procedure utilizes a Banbury™ mixer in which the elastomer, secondary rubber, carbon black, non-black fillers, and plasticizer are added and the composition mixed for the desired time or to a particular temperature to achieve adequate dispersion of the ingredients in the blend. Alternatively, the rubber and a portion of the carbon black (e.g., one-third to two thirds) is mixed for a short time (e.g., about 1 to 3 minutes) followed by the remainder of the carbon black and aid. Mixing is continued for about 1 to 10 minutes at high rotor speed during which time the mixed components reach a temperature of about 140°C. Following cooling, the components are mixed in a second step on a rubber mill or in a Banbury™ mixer during which the curing agent and optional accelerators, are thoroughly and uniformly dispersed at relatively low temperature, for example, about 80°C to about 105°C, to avoid premature curing of the composition. Variations in mixing will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
[0073]	The elastomer may be present in elastomeric compositions from 10<br>
to 100 phr in one embodiment, and from 20 to 80 phr in another embodiment, and from 30 to 70 phr in yet another embodiment, and from 40 to 60 phr in yet another embodiment, wherein a desirable phr range for the elastomer is any upper phr limit combined with any lower phr limit described herein.<br>

In yet another embodiment, the secondary rubber is present from at least 2 phr, and from at least 5 phr in another embodiment, and from at least 5 phr in yet another embodiment, and from at least 10 phr in yet another embodiment. Other ranges also include any combination of any upper phr limit and any lower phr limit. For example, the secondary rubber, either individually or as a blend of rubbers such as, for example NR, may be present from 5 phr to 40 phr in one embodiment, and from 8 to 30 phr in another embodiment, and from 10 to 25 phr in yet another embodiment, and from 5 to 25 phr in yet another embodiment, and from 5 to 15 phr in yet another embodiment, wherein a desirable range of NR may be any combination of any upper phr limit with any lower phr limit.<br>

processing aids, which are commercially available from Texas Petrochemicals, LP in Houston, TX. Suitable examples include TPC™ 150, 175, 1105, 1160 and 1285. The TPC™ series of polybutene processing aids are typically synthetic liquid polybutenes, each individual formulation having a certain molecular weight, all formulations of which can be used in the composition.<br>
[0084]	Below, Table 1 shows some of the properties of the TPC™ aids<br>
described herein, wherein the viscosity was determined as per ASTM D445.<br><br>
[0085]	The elastomeric composition may include one or more types of<br>
polybutene as a mixture, blended either prior to addition to the elastomer or with the elastomer. The amount and identity (e.g., viscosity, Mn, etc.) of the polybutene processing aid mixture can be varied in this manner. Thus, TPC™ 150 can be used when low viscosity is desired in the composition, while TPC™ 1285 can be used when a higher viscosity is desired, or compositions thereof to achieve some other viscosity or molecular weight. In this manner, the physical properties of the composition can be controlled. As used herein process aid make include a single aid or a composition of two or more aids used to obtain any<br><br><br>
viscosity or molecular weight (or other property) desired, as specified in the ranges disclosed herein.<br>
[0086]	Other suitable processing aids include the SUNDEX™ series of<br>
aids available from Sunoco, Inc., particularly SUNDEX™ 750T, 790, 790T, 8125, and 8600T and the CALSOL™ series of aids available from R.E. Carroll, particularly CALSOL™ 510, 5120, 5550, 804, 806, and 810. Properties of these aids can be found in THE BLUE BOOK: MATERIALS, COMPOUNDING INGREDIENTS, MACHINERY AND SERVICES FOR RUBBER (published by Rubber World magazine, a Lippincott &amp; Peto publication, 1867 West Market St., Akron, Ohio), which is incorporate herein by reference.<br>
[0087]	The processing aid or aids are generally present in the elastomeric<br>
composition from 1 to 60 phr, alternatively from 2 to 40 phr, alternatively from 4 to 35 phr, alternatively from 5 to 30 phr, alternatively from 5 to 25 phr, alternatively 5 to 15, alternatively 6 to 14, alternatively 8 to 14, alternatively from 2 to 20 phr, alternatively from 2 to 10 phr, wherein a range of processing aid may be any upper phr limit combined with any lower phr limit described herein.<br>
Additives<br>
[0088]	The elastomeric composition may also have one or more filler<br>
components such as, for example, calcium carbonate, silica, clay and other silicates which may or may not be exfoliated, talc, titanium dioxide, and carbon black. In one embodiment, the filler is carbon black or modified carbon black, and combinations thereof. The filler may also be a blend of carbon black and silica. An exemplary filler for such articles as tire treads and sidewalls is reinforcing grade carbon black present from 10 to 100 phr, alternatively 20 to 90 phr, alternatively 30 to 80 phr, alternatively 40 to 80 phr, and alternatively 50 to 80 phr, wherein a range of carbon black may be any upper phr limit combined with any lower phr limit described herein. Useful grades of carbon black, as described in RUBBER TECHNOLOGY, 59-85, range from N110 to N990. More<br><br><br>
desirably, embodiments of the carbon black useful in, for example, tire treads are N229, N351, N339, N220, N234 and N110 provided in ASTM (D3037, D1510, and D3765). Embodiments of the carbon black useful in, for example, sidewalls in tires, are N330, N351, N550, N650, N660, and N762. Carbon blacks suitable for innerliners and other air barriers include N550, N660, N650, N762, N990 and Regal 85.<br>
[0089]	When clay is present as a filler, it may be a swellable clay in one<br>
embodiment, which may or may not be exfoliated or partially exfoliated using an exfoliating agent. Suitable swellable clay materials include natural or synthetic phyllosilicates, particularly smectic clays such as montmorillonite, nontronite, beidellite, volkonskoite, laponite, hectorite, saponite, sauconite, magadite, kenyaite, stevensite and the like, as well as vermiculite, halloysite, aluminate oxides, hydrotalcite and the like. These swellable clays generally comprise particles containing a plurality of silicate platelets having a thickness of 8-12 A, and contain exchangeable cations such as Na+, Ca+2, K+ or Mg^2 present at the interlayer surfaces. They may also be surface treated (or modified) with intercalant surfactants or materials such as alkyl, ammonium salts.<br>
[0090]	The swellable clay may be exfoliated by treatment with organic<br>
molecules (swelling or exfoliating "agents" or "additives") capable of undergoing ion exchange reactions with the cations present at the interlayer surfaces of the layered silicate. Suitable exfoliating agents include cationic surfactants such as ammonium, alkylamines or alkylammonium (primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary), phosphonium or sulfonium derivatives of aliphatic, aromatic or arylaliphatic amines, phosphines and sulfides. Desirable amine compounds (or the corresponding ammonium ion) are those with the structure R2R3R4N, wherein R2, R3, and R4 are C( to Cao alky Is or alkenes in one embodiment, Ci to €20 alkyls or alkenes in another embodiment, which may be the same or different. In one embodiment, the exfoliating agent is a so called long chain tertiary amine, wherein at least R2 is a CH to C2o alkyl or alkene.<br><br><br>
[0091]	The fillers may be any size and typically range, for example, from<br>
about 0.0001 urn to about 100 um. As used herein, silica is meant to refer to any type or particle size silica or another silicic acid derivative, or silicic acid, processed by solution, pyrogenic or the like methods and having a surface area, including untreated, precipitated silica, crystalline silica, colloidal silica, aluminum or calcium silicates, fumed silica, and the like.<br>
[0092]	In some embodiments, one or more crosslinking agents are used in<br>
the elastomeric compositions, especially when silica is the primary filler, or is<br>
present in combination with another filler. Alternatively, the coupling agent may<br>
be a bifunctional organosilane crosslinking agent. An "organosilane crosslinking<br>
agent" is any silane coupled filler and/or crosslinking activator and/or silane<br>
reinforcing agent known to those skilled in the art including, but not limited to,<br>
vinyl	triethoxysilane,	vinyl-tris-(beta-methoxyethoxy)silane,<br>
methacryloylpropyltrimethoxysilane, gamma-amino-propyl triethoxysilane (sold commercially as All00 by Witco), gamma-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (A 189 by Witco) and the like, and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, bis-(3-triethoxysilypropyl)tetrasulfide (sold commercially as Si69 by Degussa) is employed.<br>
[0093]	Other additives may also be present in the composition.   Other<br>
additives include, but are not limited to, plasticizers, tackifiers, extenders, chemical conditioners, homogenizing agents and peptizers such as mercaptans, waxes, resins, rosins, and the like.<br>
[0094]	The compositions typically contain other components and additives<br>
customarily used in rubber mixes, such as effective amounts of other nondiscolored and nondiscoloring processing aids, pigments, accelerators, crosslinking and curing materials, antioxidants, antiozonants. General classes of accelerators include amines, diamines, guanidines, thioureas, thiazoles, thiurams, sulfenamides, sulfenimides, thiocarbamates, xanthates, and the like. Crosslinking and curing agents include sulfur, zinc oxide, and fatty acids. Peroxide cure<br><br><br>
systems may also be used. The components, and other curatives, are typically present from 0.1 to 10 phr in the composition.<br>
[0095]	Generally, polymer blends, for example, those used to produce tires,<br>
are crosslinked. It is known that the physical properties, performance characteristics, and durability of vulcanized rubber compounds are directly related to the number (crosslink density) and type of crosslinks formed during the vulcanization reaction. (See, e.g., Helt et al., The Post Vulcanization Stabilization for NR in RUBBER WORLD, 18-23 (1991)). Generally, polymer blends may be crosslinked by adding curative molecules, for example sulfur, metal oxides, organometallic compounds, radical initiators, etc., followed by heating. In particular, the following metal oxides are common useful curatives: ZnO, CaO, MgO, A^Oa, CrOs, FeO, Fe2O"3, and NiO. These metal oxides can be used alone or in conjunction with the corresponding metal fatty acid complex (e.g., zinc stearate, calcium stearate, etc.), or with the organic and fatty acids added alone, such as stearic acid, and optionally other curatives such as sulfur or a sulfur compound, an alkylperoxide compound, diamines or derivatives thereof (e.g., DIAK products sold by DuPont). (See also, Formulation Design and Curing Characteristics of NBR Mixes for Seals, RUBBER WORLD 25-30 (1993)). This method of curing elastomers may be accelerated and is often used for the vulcanization of elastomer blends.<br>
[0096]	The acceleration of the cure process may be accomplished by adding<br>
to the composition an amount of an accelerant, often an organic compound. The mechanism for accelerated vulcanization of natural rubber involves complex interactions between the curative, accelerator, activators and polymers. Ideally, all the available curative is consumed in the formation of effective crosslinks that join together two polymer chains and enhance the overall strength of the polymer matrix. Numerous accelerators are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, the following: stearic acid, diphenyl guanidine (DPG), tetramethylthiuram disulfide (TMTD), 4,4'-dithiodimorpholine (DTDM), tetrabutylthiuram disulfide (TBTD), benzothiazyl disulfide (MBTS), hexamethylene-l,6-bisthiosulfate disodium salt dihydrate (sold commercially as DURALINK™ HTS by Flexsys), 2-<br><br><br>
(morpholinothio) benzothiazole (MBS or MOR), blends of 90% MOR and 10% MBTS (MOR 90), N-tertiarybutyl-2-benzothiazole sulfenamide (TBBS), and N-oxydiethylene thiocarbamyl-N-oxydiethylene sulfonamide (OTOS), zinc 2-ethyl hexanoate (ZEH), and "thioureas".<br>
[0097]	The materials are mixed by conventional means known to those<br>
skilled in the art, in a single step or in stages. In one embodiment, the carbon black is added in a different stage from zinc oxide and other cure activators and accelerators. In another embodiment, antioxidants, antiozonants and processing materials are added in a stage after the carbon black has been processed with the elastomeric composition, and zinc oxide is added at a final stage to maximize compound modulus. In an embodiment, a two to three (or more) stage processing sequence is employed. Additional stages may involve incremental additions of filler and processing aids.<br>
[0098]	The compositions may be vulcanized by subjecting them using heat<br>
or radiation according to any conventional vulcanization process. Typically, the vulcanization is conducted at a temperature ranging from about 100°C to about 250°C in one embodiment, from 150°C to 200°C in another embodiment, for about 1 to 150 minutes.<br>
Microlayered Composite<br>
[0099]	The microlayered composites and articles of the present invention<br>
may be manufactured by any means known in the art such as lamination, coating, bonding, adhesion, and coextrusion.<br>
[00100]	For example, the microlayered composites and articles may be<br>
manufactured using coextrusion. Such methods and devices are known in the art. For example,  Schrenk,  W.J., Alfrey,  T.,  Jr., Some Physical Properties of Multilayered Films, 9 POLYMER ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE, 393-99 (1969), and U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,557,265, 3,565,985, 3,687,589, 3,759,647, 3,773,882, 3,884,606,<br><br><br>
4,965,135, 5,094,793, 5,094,788, and 5,389,324 disclose devices and processes suitable to prepare coextruded multilayered composites and microlayered composites , See also for general principles, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,711,176, 6,379,791, 6,630,239, U.S. Pat. App. 2002/0132925, WO 00/76765, and WO 00/15067 Al.<br>
[00101]	In an embodiment, various molten streams are transported to an<br>
extrusion die outlet and joined together in proximity of the outlet. In an embodiment, a multiplication die is employed such as the multiplication die designed by Schrenk and Alfrey. The precise extruder will vary depending on the end use application and its selection is apparent to one skilled in the art. A number of useful extruders are known and include single and twin screw extruders, batch-off extruders, and the like. Conventional extruders are commercially available from a variety of vendors such as from Berlyn Extruders (Worcester, Mass.), Bonnot Manufacturing (Uniontown, Ohio), Killion Extruders (Cedar Grove, N.J.) and Leistritz Corp. (Sommerville, N.J.). However, a process that produces composites having multiple stratified layers with hundreds and sometimes thousands of alternating layers in certain embodiments is useful. In some embodiments, the layers may have a thickness from a few microns, such as 3u, 4u, or 5u, to less than lu. In other embodiments, the microlayered composite may have a plurality of layers of from 15nm to 2u, alternatively from lOnm to 2u, and alternatively from Inm to 2u. The layer thicknesses may either be uniform or variable in thickness depending on the desired properties for end use applications.<br>
[00102]	The microlayered composites and articles of the present invention<br>
may comprise a plurality of layers. The layers may comprise a single material or blends of materials as well as multiple layers of different materials in any single layer. The layers may also comprise different materials in the overall form of the microlayered composite and the article.<br>
[00103]	For example, in certain embodiments, the microlayered composites<br>
and articles may comprise repeating layers of an AB structure. In another example, the microlayered composites and articles may comprise repeating layers<br><br><br>
of an ABC structure In other examples, the microlayered composites and articles may comprise repeating unit patterns such as ABCABC or ABCBABCB.<br>
[00104]	In yet other examples, the microlayered composites and articles<br>
may comprise an (AB)n form wherein n is an integer of from 50 to 50,000 , with either A and/or B layers as the outermost layers (e.g., (AB) nA, (BA)nB, or (AB)n), including but not limited to A(BA)nBA and ACBC(ACBC)nA.<br>
[00105]	The composition of the microlayered composite may contain A, B,<br>
C or more layers in any proportion as dictated by their desired application. For example, for use within tire innerliner applications where the materials have low modulus and high elasticity, from about 1 * 106 Pa at 50% strain to about 1*105 Pa at 50% strain is suitable. The compositions that deliver a low modulus and high elasticity will be easily recognized by those skilled in the art to contain low volume fractions of the high barrier thermoplastic. Another example may contain less than 20% of the high barrier thermoplastic phase. Other examples include compositions containing less than about 10% of the high barrier thermoplastic phase. And yet other examples include those containing about 5% of the high barrier thermoplastic phase.<br>
[00106]	An additional consideration for a microlayered composite used<br>
within a tire innerliner is the order of the individual layers. In an embodiment, the layer structure should be such that the outermost layer has the greatest interaction with the inside of the tire. In general, this will mean that the outermost layer in the composite will be the elastomer phase or an additional optional bonding phase. For example, an outer-most elastomer phase will be a composition comprising a halogenated poly(isobutylene-co-isoprene) or a brominated poly(isobutylene-co-4-methylstyrene).<br><br><br>
Industrial Application<br>
[00107]	The microlayered composites and articles of the present invention<br>
find utility in a variety of air barrier applications such as, in one embodiment, the article is selected from innerliners, innertubes, and air sleeves. Other useful items include but are not limited to hoses, seals, mounts, molded goods, gaskets, ring structures, cable housing, and other articles disclosed in THE VANDERBILT RUBBER HANDBOOK 637-772 (R.T. Vanderbilt Company, Inc. 1990).<br>
PROPHETIC Example Prophetic Example to Prepare Microlayered Composites Having Parallel Layers<br>
[00108]	To make samples with a feedblock that produces a structure with<br>
24 alternating layers of elastomer and high barrier thermoplastic resin the following procedure may be performed. The primary coextrusion line may consist of a 30 mm diameter, 24:1 length-to-diameter ratio (L/D) single screw extruder for the elastomer and a 19 mm diameter, 24:1 L/D single screw extruder for the high barrier thermoplastic resin. These extruders may be attached to a feedblock that is designed to produce the desired microlayer structure consisting of a 10% high barrier thermoplastic resin and 90% elastomer layer. For a typical run, the coextrusion line will proceed for a specified time, such as a minimum of thirty minutes, to ensure that steady-state conditions have been reached. A normal extrusion rate is approximately 3 kg/hr. The coextruded structures may be extruded at approximately 200°C.<br>
[00109]	A schematic diagram of an arrangement of a feedblock and<br>
extruders is provided in Figure 1. In particular, Figure 1 shows a first extruder 1 and a second extruder 3 with a feedblock 5 along with variable depth thermocouples 7. By increasing the number of layers, the impact of imperfections in each layer of the two-layered structure will be minimized.<br><br><br>
[00110]	Additionally,  increasing the number of layers to  256 greatly<br>
enhances the overall balance of mechanical and barrier properties. It may be achieved by designing a feedblock that can produce coextruded structures with 256 alternating layers. A schematic diagram of the style of feedblock used to produce this structure is provided in Figures 2 and 3. In particular, Figure 2 shows a front view of a feedblock 5 with an inflow 11 and outflow 9. Figure 3 shows a side view of a feedblock 5 with a first inflow 13 and a second inflow 15 along with an outflow 17. All layers are fairly uniform and parallel.<br>
[00111]	One important observation of the 256-layer structure is that some<br>
layer defects are introduced due to thinning of the layers but the overall contribution of an individual layer to permance is greatly minimized. Structures with greater than 4,096 alternating layers may be produced by similar methodology and equipment.<br>
[00112]	The table below illustrates particular combinations of elastomeric<br>
compositions and high barrier thermoplastic resins along with their barrier performance. Such combinations would be suitable in the practice of the invention. Other combinations are also suitable and apparent to one skilled in the art.<br><br><br>
