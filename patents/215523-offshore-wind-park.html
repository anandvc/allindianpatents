				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a wind farm comprising at least two wind<br>
turbines and in particular to an offshore wind farm.<br><br>
The wind turbines in wind farms are spaced from one another at such<br>
distances that any collision of blades is securely avoided even when the wind<br>
turns direction, and the effects of one wind turbine on another as a result of<br>
changing air flow conditions are kept as small as possible. The distance<br>
between wind turbines is dependent on the radius of the circle swept by the<br>
rotor of a wind turbine and, with rotor diameters in excess of 100 m now<br>
possible at the current state of technological development, the distance<br>
between wind turbines will increase still further due to the even larger<br>
dimensions of new wind turbines.<br>
Depending on location and size, each wind turbine requires maintenance<br>
and the elimination of any malfunctions that may arise. To do this, personnel<br>
and material must be transported to the wind turbine.<br>
It is relatively easy to bring personnel and material to every wind turbine on<br>
land-based wind farms, whereas in the case of offshore wind farms this<br>
involves much greater effort and expense. The process can be simplified by<br><br>
bringing people and goods, such as tools, spare parts, etc. to one place only, rather<br>
than having to call at each separate wind turbine on a wind farm.<br>
The problem which then arises is that of distributing landed goods, or generally of<br>
transporting goods and/or people between the wind turbines of a wind farm, and<br>
particularly of an offshore wind farm.<br>
Based on the premise that a wind farm has a central landing place where all goods and<br>
persons arrive or depart, the latter must accordingly be transported between the<br>
separate wind turbines of the wind farm. One characteristic of offshore wind farms is<br>
that the weather there is always rougher than on land. Winds can blow unobstructed<br>
and quickly reach high speeds. Furthermore, waves of greater or lesser height must be<br>
expected at all times. Therefore, transporting goods and ferrying people to the separate<br>
wind turbines is not only unpleasant in many cases, but may even involve a<br>
considerable degree of risk, and at high wind forces is practically impossible.<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to provide a wind farm in which the<br>
separate wind turbines of the wind farm can be reliably serviced, and in which such<br>
servicing can still be performed even when rough weather conditions prevail for several<br>
days.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention with an offshore wind farm comprising<br>
a plurality of wind turbines and at least one offshore platform arranged between the<br>
plurality of wind turbines, said offshore platform being suitable for providing a living and<br>
accommodation space for the personnel operating the plurality of wind turbines, wherein<br>
a cable connection is provided above water level between said at least one offshore<br>
platform and the wind turbines, wherein a gondola hanging on said cable connection is<br>
provided for moving between said at least one offshore platform and the wind turbines<br>
above water level. Advantageous embodiments are described hereinafter.<br>
The wind farm according to the invention comprises not only a plurality<br>
of wind turbines, but also has a separate offshore platform on which people<br><br>
responsible for servicing the wind farm can live and work. Such an offshore<br>
platform must presumably be equipped in such a way that persons staying<br>
there can also remain) and take care of themselves there for several weeks at<br>
a time. This requires, therefore, that the offshore platform be fitted with<br>
appropriate "social" facilities, i.e. sleeping quarters, mess rooms, kitchen,<br>
recreation rooms, etc.<br>
If, at higher wind forces, operating personnel has to cross to one turbine or<br>
the other in order to carry out maintenance or servicing, said wind turbines<br>
can preferably be reached via the cableway connection running from the<br>
platform. This obviatjes the need for any kind of transportation by ship or<br>
helicopter, while also enabling the maintenance and servicing material to be<br>
transported at the same time via the cableway connection.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the platform can also be equipped<br>
with an electrolysis plant so that water can be converted to its hydrogen and<br>
oxygen constituents using the electricity generated by the wind turbine. The<br>
hydrogen produced in this way, and preferably also the oxygen, is stored in<br>
appropriate gas tankjs (on the platform) and can then be transported to land<br>
by ship or pipeline.<br>
In certain circumstances, such production of hydrogen and oxygen can<br>
make particular sense if fuel cell drives for vehicles become established,<br>
because in such a case there will be a very high demand for hydrogen, which<br>
can be generated on the high seas with the invention, without said production<br>
posing a hazard in any way for facilities on land, such as buildings,<br>
residential areas, etc.<br>
If necessary, it is possible to provide several platforms instead of just one, in<br>
such a way that, in addition to a residential platform, there is also a<br>
"hydrogen production platform". In the event of an accident on the production<br><br>
platform, the personnel still has the chance to withdraw to the safety of the<br>
residential platform.<br>
In such a case, the separate platforms should, of course, be connected to<br>
each other with a suitable cableway connection.<br>
The cableway connection is usually fitted with a motoric drive. For safety<br>
reasons, it is also advantageous if cableway transport is still possible when a<br>
power failure has occurred. Such a manual drive could be provided in the<br>
form of suitable facilities that can be operated with human power.<br>
In the cableway or cable connection, the cable is preferably spanned at such<br>
a height that it neither impinges on the rotor diameter of the wind turbine nor<br>
touches the crests of waves, such than ships are unable to collide with the<br>
cable connections even when the waves are high.<br>
A deflection member for the cable connection can be provided on each wind<br>
turbine and on each platform, such that the cable connection is spanned as<br>
an endless cable loop between the deflection members and the gondola is<br>
fixedly connected to the cable connection. By this means, the gondola can be<br>
driven in the desired direction by moving the cable connection, and the<br>
structure is kept very simple.<br>
When there are two wind turbines connected to each other, the cable<br>
connection travels around the deflection member at each wind turbine and<br>
back to the other wind turbine.<br>
When the cable connection connects at least three wind turbines with each,<br>
the deflection member on the middle wind turbine serves as a support, and<br>
the cable connection is guided onwards to the respective outer wind turbine.<br><br>
The cable connection can be moved by means of a motor, and preferably by<br>
an electrically driven motor. This is particularly advantageous, because<br>
electrical energy is generated in the wind farm and is therefore readily<br>
available, thus obviating the need to transport other energy carriers, such as<br>
fuel. Electric motors can also be controlled in a simple manner.<br>
The cable connection suitably comprises a main cable and a traction cable.<br>
Although the gondola is mounted on the main cable, it is able to travel in<br>
relation to said main cable. The traction cable is attached to the gondola.<br>
When the traction cable is pulled in the desired direction of travel, the<br>
gondola moves along the main cable in the desired direction. This traction on<br>
the traction cable can be provided by a motor. Electrical energy is<br>
advantageously used as the drive energy.<br>
The deflection member preferably comprises two independently rotatable<br>
deflection pulleys, whereby the main cable is guided over pne roller and the<br>
traction cable over the other roller. The traction cable can be configured as a<br>
circulating endless cable loop, whereas the main cable can be provided only<br>
once along the stretch travelled by the gondola. Due to the endless traction<br>
cable, it is sufficient to have a reversible drive for the traction cable in order to<br>
drive the gondola in the desired direction, and one can dispense with any<br>
reeling devices for the traction cable at the two ends thereof.<br>
In one particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the gondola moves<br>
along the main cable under its own power. A motoric drive and preferably an<br>
electromotoric drive can be provided for this purpose, whereby the store of<br>
energy for driving the motor is provided in an energy storage means in the<br>
gondola, for example in an accumulator.<br>
A manual drive may be provided as an alternative to the motoric drive, or as<br>
a supplementary emergency drive so that the gondola can be moved in<br><br>
emergency operation even when there is a failure of the motor or the energy<br>
store.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the drive energy is<br>
supplied via the cable connection, the main cable, the traction cable and/or a<br>
separate conductor line when the gondola is driven electrically. By this<br>
means, control signals can also be transmitted to the gondola and/or a tower<br>
by remote control, for example to control the drive motor or a winch or the<br>
like.<br>
In a preferred development of the invention, telematics data, for example, are<br>
transmitted via the electrical connection to a central facility or to several wind<br>
turbines. Furthermore, it is possible via the cable connection to process the<br>
communications, with each other and with the gondola, of all the wind<br>
turbines in the wind farm between which the cable car is provided.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the invention, these communications, that is<br>
to say, for example, the transmission of telematics data, control signals, etc.<br>
between separate wind turbines on the wind farm and/or the gondola, can be<br>
effected at least in part by wireless transmission.<br>
The cable connection can be structured in different ways. A simple structure<br>
is based on the principle of a chain, in which all wind turbines are connected<br>
to each other by the cable connection "like beads on a chain". In this<br>
structure, the cable connection is a single continuous cable connection that<br>
connects at least some of the wind turbines in a predefinable series with<br>
each other.<br>
However, the wind turbines may also be positioned in several rows, for<br>
example in three rows, and the cable connection follows, for example, a path<br><br>
in the shape of the letter "S" between the wind turbines to connect the wind turbines with<br>
each other.<br>
An alternative variant of the cable system is a star-shaped arrangement of the cable<br>
connection, starting from a central facility representing, for example, a central landing<br>
place, so that all other wind turbines can be reached by the shortest possible path.<br>
Another variant is a networked cable system that not only provides shortest possible<br>
connections from a central wind turbine to the other wind turbines, but also forms<br>
relatively short stretches between all the wind turbines.<br>
In order to keep the horizontal displacement of the gondola on the cable connection low<br>
while the gondola is travelling between the wind turbines of a wind farm, or to prevent<br>
such displacement within certain limits, the wind farm according to the invention has, in<br>
a preferred development, a holding cable that is provided at a predefined vertical<br>
distance parallel to the cable connection. The distance is dimensioned in such a way<br>
that the gondola is guided between the cable connection and the holding cable. In this<br>
arrangement, the cable connection is preferably above the gondola, and the holding<br>
cable is below the gondola.<br>
In a particularly advantageous development of the invention, one (upper) part of the<br>
endless cable loop in a cable connection configured as an endless loop can carry the<br>
gondola, while the other (lower) part of the endless cable loop performs the function of<br>
the holding cable.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, a flywheel rotating about a vertical axis is used to stabilise<br>
the gondola. Said flywheel is driven by a motor and acts as a gyroscope to counter any<br>
horizontal displacement of the gondola.<br><br>
Preferably, each wind turbine of the wind farm has a closeable door in its<br>
tower. Said door is generally located at the height at which the gondola<br>
reaches the wind turbine. This enables loading activities to be performed<br>
without having to overcome a difference in height.<br>
In another preferred development, the wind turbines and the gondola have a<br>
locking device that permits the loading and unloading position of the gondola<br>
to be prescribed, such that swinging movements of the gondola relative to<br>
the tower of the wind turbine are prevented when the gondola is in said<br>
position. The locking device is preferably configured in such a way that one<br>
part of the locking device is provided close to the door on the tower of the<br>
wind turbine, and the other part at a suitable position on the gondola. A<br>
particularly preferred embodiment is one in which the locking device is a two-<br>
point locking device, in order to avoid the formation of a pivotal point that<br>
occurs when locking operates at one point only.<br>
Preferably, said locking device can function electromagnetically and be<br>
switched on and off by operating a switch inside the tower and/or from the<br>
gondola. This enables convenient and secure handling without the risk of<br>
injury as a result of a swinging gondola that may, for example, collide with<br>
the tower due to wind action.<br>
In one preferred development of the invention, the locking device can be<br>
remotely controlled, and it is particularly preferred for it to be remotely<br>
controllable from the gondola so that manual operation can be avoided. By<br>
this means, the latent risk of injury when operating the locking device is<br>
further reduced.<br>
A particularly preferred embodiment is one in which a cover of substantially<br>
horizontal extension is mounted above the opening on at least one wind<br>
turbine, said cover bearing a protective wall extending substantially vertically<br><br>
and at a predefined distance parallel to the cable connection. By means of<br>
the cover and the protective wall, which enclose a predefined angle, a<br>
protective roof is formed that protects the gondola when in the area of the<br>
opening as well as the opening itself against weather. The gondola and the<br>
opening are protected by the tower itself, on the one hand, and by the<br>
protective roof, on the other, such that the gondola is shielded against the<br>
wind and is not pushed against the tower.<br>
If the protective roof is made long enough, displacement of the gondola and<br>
hence a potential collision with the tower can be avoided even when the wind<br>
or wind vectors are transverse to the direction in which the gondola is<br>
travelling.<br>
The horizontal spacing between the outer ends of the first protective wall and<br>
the tower is preferably greater than the horizontal spacing to the central<br>
portion of the protective wall. In this way, collisions between the gondola and<br>
the protective wall are prevented even when the gondola is horizontally<br>
displaced towards the protective wall, for example by cross winds.<br>
In one preferred development of the invention, additional protective walls can<br>
be attached to the tower on both sides of the opening parallel to the first<br>
protective wall and at the same height, said additional walls extending the<br>
area in lee of the tower such that a wind vector transverse to the direction in<br>
which the gondola is travelling does not push the latter against the outer<br>
protective wall. The horizontal distance between the protective walls at the<br>
tower can be substantially equal to the width of the gondola and enlarge<br>
towards the lateral ends of the protective walls, such that a horizontal<br>
displacement of the gondola in the entry area between the protective walls<br>
does not lead to collisions between the gondola and one of the protective<br>
walls.<br><br>
The gondola itself can preferably be fitted with elastic coating at each of the<br>
corners on the lower portion of the gondola cabin, and hence at those points<br>
that will be affected first in the event that a collision with other facilities of the<br>
wind farm occurs as a result of the gondola being horizontally displaced. On<br>
the one hand, said coatings dampen any collision that might occur, thus<br>
preventing damage occurring to the gondola and other facilities of the wind<br>
farm, and on the other hand they serve as buoyancy aids to keep the<br>
gondola buoyant in the event of an accident.<br>
At the same time as, or in place of the elastic coating on the gondola, such a<br>
coating may also be provided on the protective walls, especially in the entry<br>
area and at a height at which a horizontally displaced gondola first collides<br>
with the protective wall.<br>
A particularly preferred embodiment is one in which a first gangboard is<br><br>
provided at the second protective wall, said gangboard having a retention<br>
facility, such as a railing, all around it. In one advantageous development of<br>
the invention, the gangboard extends over the entire length of the protective<br>
wall and is attached in such a way that it can be reached from the opening.<br>
By this means, the outer side of the gondola can be reached in order to<br>
perform repair work and/or maintenance and cleaning work, for example. If<br>
the second protective wall is present, the gangboard can be delineated on<br>
one side by said protective wall, and a retention facility can be dispensed<br>
with there.<br>
It is particularly preferred to provide a second gangboard parallel to the first<br>
on the first protective wall. Said second gangboard, too, has a retention<br>
facility on the sides which are not adjacent to the first protective wall.<br><br>
As a further preferred embodiment, a transverse gangboard can be provided<br>
at at least one outer end of the first and second gangboards, wherein said<br>
transverse gangboard bridges the gap between the substantially parallel first<br>
and second gangboards.<br>
To enable unobstructed entry and exit of the gondola, the transverse<br>
gangboard can be pivotably coupled at one of its ends and pivoted upwards<br>
about its pivot axis in order to clear the way for the gondola to pass through.<br>
In one advantageous development of the invention, such transverse<br>
pivotable gangboards are coupled at both ends of the first or the second<br>
gangboard, thus enabling all sides of the gondola to be reached from the<br>
outside.<br>
The gap between one transverse gangboard and the other is preferably<br>
selected so that it is substantially equal to the relevant dimensions of the<br>
gondola. In one particularly preferred development of the invention, at least<br>
one of the transverse gangboards is slideable along its pivotal axis, such that<br>
the distance between the transverse gangboards can be altered and hence<br>
adjusted to the respective requirements.<br>
On at least one wind turbine tower, a hoisting apparatus can be provided,<br>
preferably under the protective roof, said hoisting device enabling the<br>
handling of heavy freight, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the<br>
handling of the gondola and gondola parts, for example for repairs. By<br>
means of such a hoisting apparatus, provided it is designed for an<br>
appropriate load, the entire gondola can be hoisted so that the underside of<br>
the gondola can be reached from the gangboard for repair, maintenance and<br>
cleaning purposes.<br>
In one alternative embodiment of the invention, a suitably mounted single- or<br>
multi-part working platform can be provided in place of gangboards in order<br><br>
to reach the outer sides of the gondola. To this end, the area of the working<br>
platform can have a minimum size that enables all sides of the gondola to be<br>
accessed from the outside.<br>
In another alternative embodiment of the invention, a working cage or a<br>
crown safety platform can be provided, wherein said cage or platform can be<br>
moved and/or pivoted such that the outer sides of the gondola can be<br>
reached. The crown safety platform, like the working platform, is enclosed on<br>
all sides by a retention facility in order to prevent any unintentional fall from<br>
the platform or cage on the part of personnel working thereon.<br>
In one particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the door is larger<br>
than the cross section of the gondola, and the cable system extends into the<br>
tower of the wind turbine. This is achieved by having at least one set of<br>
points at each tower along the cable connection. In this way the gondola can<br>
travel through the opened door in the tower and be loaded and/or unloaded<br>
therein regardless of weather conditions;<br>
A closed gondola provides for transportation of people and goods in such a<br>
manner that they are substantially protected against the weather. In one<br>
particularly preferred development of the invention, the gondola is configured<br>
so that it has a closeable exit opening through which the guide with which the<br>
gondola is suspended from the cable connection and guided can be reached.<br>
In order to avoid the loss of the gondola in the event of it falling from the<br>
cable, the gondola is preferably designed to be buoyant, and can dispose of<br>
signalling means such as signal guns, flares or the like, as well as buoyancy<br>
aids such as automatic self-inflating float rings. These buoyancy aids<br>
increase the buoyancy of the gondola so that it remains buoyant even when<br>
loaded. In one preferred development of the invention, the gondola has<br><br>
righting aids that at least make it more difficult for the gondola to overturn, or<br>
indeed prevent it from doing so.<br>
In order to effect monitoring of operation, or at least semi-automatic control of<br>
the cable car system, a central control device as well as a plurality of sensors<br>
and/or actuators are provided. The sensors and/or actuators can be<br><br>
connected to the central control device via an interface.<br>
By means of sensors connected thereto, the central control device can thus<br>
identify, on the one hand, certain operating parameters and states, for<br>
instance the position of the gondola, its operating speed, the horizontal<br>
displacement, the weight of the gondola, the rotational speed of a flywheel<br>
mass, the amount of energy stored, motor operational data, the openings in<br>
the towers (closed, open, ...), etc. Of course, telematics data can also be<br>
captured by sensors in the machine house of a wjnd turbine and<br>
subsequently processed.<br>
By means of the actuators provided, the central control unit is able to<br>
influence operating parameters and states. This can involve, for example,<br>
controlling the locking device between the gondola and the tower, depending<br>
on the position of the gondola relative to the tower, or controlling the lighting<br>
under the protective roof, or controlling position lights (insofar as any are<br>
provided on the towers and/or other parts of the wind farm) depending on<br>
brightness, or automatically releasing or operating doors, or influencing the<br>
speed of the gondola, including bringing it to a stop.<br>
In one alternative embodiment of the invention, the control system can be<br>
decentralised. To this end, separate control systems can be provided in at<br>
least two of the facilities on a wind farm, said systems communicating with<br>
each other and with the gondola. In this way, operating parameters and<br>
states can likewise be identified and analysed. Each control system can be<br><br>
connected with a predefinable portion of the sensors and/or actuators. One<br>
advantage of this decentralised solution is the redundancy thus provided,<br>
such that in the event of a control unit failure, neighbouring control units can<br>
take over its functions.<br>
In one particularly advantageous development of the invention, support<br>
masts are provided between wind turbines on a wind farm in order to support<br>
the cable connection and in this way prevent excessive sag of the cable<br>
connection between the towers, as well as the loads that can ensue as a<br>
result of large spans between the towers of the wind turbines on a wind farm.<br>
The wind farm according to the invention is preferably equipped with at least<br>
one accommodation area for accommodating at least one person. The space<br>
within said accommodation area is preferably organised into different<br>
functional areas, such as a sanitation area and/or a kitchen area and/or a<br>
pantry area and/or a rest area, and it is particularly preferable that it be<br>
integrated into the tower of a wind turbine.<br>
In one alternative embodiment of the invention, the accommodation area is<br>
located separately from the wind turbines but within the wind farm. This<br>
location can be a separate platform, for example, or can preferably be on a<br>
platform mounted on a tower of a wind turbine.<br>
Said platform can serve additional functions, such as those of a helicopter<br>
pad and/or a ship"s berth.<br>
Due to the limited area inside the tower, the accommodation area in a<br>
preferred development of the invention is distributed among several<br>
interconnected levels inside the tower. Within the accommodation area,<br>
equipment for communicating and signalling predefined data is provided.<br><br>
Said signalling may include acoustic and optical signalling, or an appropriate<br>
way of recording the data.<br>
Communication includes voice and/or data communication on wire or<br>
wireless communication links, on the one hand with remote stations outside<br>
the wind farm, such as remote operations or maintenance centres, and on<br>
the other hand with remote stations inside the wind farm, such as other wind<br>
turbines or the gondola of the cable car system.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, communication also<br>
includes influencing predefined operating parameters of the wind farm<br>
facilities, as well as surveillance and control of wind farm operation. By this<br>
means, a continuously manned monitoring station can be created on the<br>
wind farm according to the invention, said monitoring station being able to<br>
respond immediately in the event of faults or failures occurring, and can take<br>
or initiate appropriate counter-measures.<br>
In one particularly preferred development of the invention, a water treatment<br>
plant for supplying the personnel with drinking water and service water is<br>
provided, said plant being operated with electrical energy generated on the<br>
wind farm. To bridge gaps in supply due, for example, to windless conditions,<br>
a suitably dimensioned energy storage means is provided to ensure that<br>
emergency operations at least are maintained in order to continue supplying<br>
the accommodation area with energy and water.<br>
The energy storage means used for this purpose can be storage means for<br>
electrical power, such as capacitors, chemical means of energy storage,<br>
such as accumulators, or storage means for hydrogen which are charged<br>
with hydrogen obtained from seawater by electrolysis, and from which<br>
electrical energy can be obtained in a fuel cell.<br><br>
In one particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, at least the wind<br>
turbine equipped with the accommodation area includes equipment for<br>
weather observation, and/or for detecting, analysing, recording and/or<br>
forwarding meteorological data. Furthermore, the wind turbine or additional<br>
(all) wind turbines in the wind farm can perform functions as navigational aids<br>
for shipping, for example in the form of a sea marker or as a station for<br>
providing (first) aid to persons involved in accidents, or to shipwrecked<br>
persons.<br>
In one development of the invention, at least one wind turbine equipped with<br>
an accommodation area has a viewing platform provided on the tower of the<br>
wind turbine below the machine house. Said viewing platform can encircle<br>
the tower of the wind turbine either completely, or at least partially in a<br>
preferred direction, and be fitted with windows that enable the surrounding<br>
area to be monitored. Said viewing platform can also be equipped with<br>
devices for signalling data, for influencing predefined operating parameters<br>
and/or for communication. The wind turbine with the viewing platform is<br>
positioned within the wind farm in such a way that a maximum number<br>
(preferably all) of the wind turbines in the wind farm can be seen from that<br>
position.<br>
The viewing platform can be provided in dose physical proximity to the<br>
accommodation area, or form an integral part thereof. Alternatively, the<br>
viewing platform and the accommodation area can be spatially separated,<br>
with the accommodation area located below the viewing platform near the<br>
base of the tower in order to permit more generous dimensions of the rooms,<br>
whereas the viewing platform is located immediately below the machine<br>
house to enable good observation of the surroundings.<br>
If the distance between the viewing platform and the accommodation area is<br>
large, an elevator can be provided inside the tower to save time when<br><br>
making several trips a day between the viewing platform and the accommodation area,<br>
on the one hand, and to limit the physical burden on the personnel, on the other hand.<br>
The elevator can be equipped with an emergency telephone facility so that help can be<br>
called in the event of the elevator breaking down.<br>
Preferred developments of the invention are described hereinafter. One embodiment<br>
shall now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings which<br>
show :<br>

Fig. 8 a side elevation view of the tower with the protective roof.<br>
Figure 1 shows a wind farm comprising nine wind turbines 12. Said wind<br>
turbines 12 are arranged in three rows, each comprising three wind turbines 12<br>
and connected with each other by a cable connection 10 in such a way<br>
that the gondola 14 can reach the separate wind turbines 12 separately and<br><br>
consecutively. Thus, when travelling from one end of the cable connection 10<br>
to the other end of the cable connection 10, the gondola 14 always passes all<br>
the wind turbines 12 on the wind farm.<br>
The cable connection 10 can be an endless cable loop on which the gondola<br>
14 is fixedly disposed. Therefore, when the cable moves, the gondola 14 is<br>
inevitably moved as well.<br>
If the endless cable loop lies in a substantially horizontal plane, the cable can<br>
be driven in a constant direction at all times, in the simplest case, and the<br>
gondola 14 moves in the opposite direction after passing the deflection point,<br>
thereby being shifted by the horizontal dimension of the endless cable loop.<br>
However, since this also applies when travelling from one wind turbine 12 to<br>
an adjacent wind turbine 12 in the opposite direction, it may be necessary to<br>
pass all the other wind turbines of the wind farm such that the gondola must<br>
travel almost twice the length of the cable connection 10.<br>
For example, if the gondola 14 is located at the wind turbine marked A and<br>
must now travel to the wind turbine marked B, it must first travel, in the case<br>
of a unidirectional cable drive, to the wind turbine marked C and from there<br>
back to the destination wind turbine marked B. In doing so, it travels the<br>
entire length of the cable connection almost twice.<br>
If it is possible to drive the cable connection in two directions, all that is<br>
needed for the trip from A to B is a reversal of the direction of travel and a<br>
short trip between two wind turbines.<br>
If the cable connection 10 is an endless cable connection in a substantially<br>
vertical plane, a means for driving the cable connection 10 in two directions<br>
is absolutely essential, since otherwise the gondola fixedly attached to the<br><br>
cable connection 10 would get into a hazardous situation at the latest on<br>
reaching the reversal point on the endless cable loop.<br>
For this reason, sensors 44 are provided on the wind turbines marked B and<br>
C in the figure, wherein said sensors identify when their position is reached<br>
by the gondola 14, and thus initiate a stop or redirection procedure. For the<br>
sake of simplicity, these sensors are shown as switches. Other types of<br>
sensor, such as Hall sensors, optical sensors, etc., are also suitable, of<br>
course, for determining whether the gondola 14 has reached this position. Of<br>
course, the position of the sensors is chosen so that there is still sufficient<br>
stopping distance even when the gondola 14 is loaded.<br>
Figure 2 likewise shows a wind farm comprising nine wind turbines 12<br>
arranged in three rows each with three wind turbines 12. In this arrangement,<br>
there is a central wind turbine 12 that can have special docking and storage<br>
facilities, for example. Radiating from this central wind turbine 12, there is a<br>
star-shaped arrangement of cable connections 10 connecting to all the other<br>
wind turbines 12 of the wind farm. This results in the shortest possible paths<br>
for the gondola 14 (not shown in this figure) to reach the other wind turbines<br>
12 - each measured from the central wind turbine 12.<br>
However, a trip from one of the non-central wind turbines 12 to another non-<br>
central wind turbine 12 always leads firstly to the central wind turbine 12 and<br>
onwards from there to the destination wind turbine 12.<br>
Also shown in this figure is a support mast 11 at a cable connection 10. Said<br>
support mast 11 supports the cable connection 10, thus preventing excessive<br>
sag of the cable connection 10 in the case of large spans between two wind<br>
turbines 12.<br><br>
This sag results from the cable connection"s own weight. Depending on the<br>
properties of the cable connection 10, there is a maximum distance between<br>
two support points for the cable connection 10, which if exceeded may result<br>
in the cable connection 10 severing under its own weight. However, even<br>
with a lower spacing between the support points, the sag in the cable<br>
connection 10 may already be too great, causing the gondola 14 to come too<br>
close to the water surface.<br>
This could be counteracted, theoretically, by having a higher tension in the<br>
cable connection 10. However, if a higher tension in the cable connection<br>
arises due to the effect of cold temperatures, the tensile strength may be<br>
exceeded and the cable connection 10 will sever. In other words, depending<br>
on the material used, a certain amount of sag in the cable connection 10 is<br>
unavoidable. However, these problems can be solved by using support<br>
masts 11.<br>
Figure 3 shows the same arrangement of wind turbines 12 as in Figures 1<br>
and 2. The difference again consists in the structure of the cable connection<br>
10 between the wind turbines 12. In Figure 3, the structure is like that of a<br>
network, such that each wind turbine 12 forms a node in the network. By<br>
means of this cable structure, even shorter distances ensue for particular<br>
stretches over which the gondola 14 (not shown in the figure) can reach<br>
particular wind turbines 12.<br>
In this figure, too, a support mast 11 is provided for a large span between two<br>
wind turbines 12 in order to limit the sag and the tension in the cable<br>
connection 10. Of course, support masts 11 can be used in any segment of<br>
the cable connection 10 between two wind turbines 12, in order to gain<br>
additional support points for the cable connection 10.<br><br>
Figure 4 shows two wind turbines 12 that are connected with each other by a cable<br>
connection 10. The upper portions of the towers have been left out in the figure,<br>
although the lower edge of the area swept by the rotors is shown by a broken line 30.<br>
Each of the towers has an opening 18 that can be closed with a door, and from each<br>
opening a ladder 32 is provided that leads to the base of the tower. The opening 18 in<br>
the tower is provided at the height at which the gondola 14 reaches the tower.<br>
Above the opening 18 on each tower, a deflection roller 16 is provided through which the<br>
cable connection 10 is guided. The gondola 14 is located on said cable connection 10.<br>
Depending on the embodiment of the cable connection 10, the gondola 14 is carried<br>
and/or driven by the cable connection, or the gondola 14 moves under its own power<br>
along the cable connection 10.<br>
In the example shown, a drive motor 15 is located on the tower of a wind turbine above<br>
the deflection pulley 16, said drive motor being able to drive the cable connection 10 in<br>
appropriate manner in the case of a gondola 14 that is not self-propelled.<br>
In the lower part of the gondola 14 there is an additional compartment 26 that is<br>
separated from the gondola cabin by the floor of the latter. Inside said compartment 26<br>
there is a flywheel 28 which by means of a drive motor is kept at a high speed of rotation<br>
about its rotational axis, shown as a broken line. As a result of this rotation, the flywheel<br>
28 acts as a gyroscope and stabilises the gondola 14 in its position by counteracting any<br>
horizontal displacement on the part of the gondola 14. By this means, the gondola 14 is<br>
stabilised while travelling and displaced to only a limited extent, even when cross winds<br>
occur.<br><br>
The drawing in Figure 5 likewise shows two towers of wind turbines 12, the<br>
upper portions of which have been omitted from the figure. However, the<br>
lower portion of the area swept by the rotors is again shown. In the towers,<br>
the closeable openings 18 are shown at the height at which the gondola<br>
reaches the wind turbine 12.<br>
Above the opening 18 there are deflection members 16 through which the<br>
cable connection 10 is guided. The gondola 14 is disposed on said cable<br>
connection 10 and can be made to travel between the wind turbines.<br>
Deflection members 16 are also provided below the openings 18. By means<br>
of these additional deflection members 16, a further cable connection in the<br>
form of a holding cable 24 is guided. Said holding cable 24 runs at a<br>
predefined .vertical distance 25 parallel to the cable connection 10 and guides<br>
the gondola 14. By this means, the horizontal excursion of the gondola 14 is<br>
limited, because it is guided both above and below by cables 10,24.<br>
The potential horizontal displacement of the gondola 14 varies according to<br>
the distance to the next wind turbine 12. When the distance between gondola<br>
14 and wind turbine 12 decreases, the stabilising effect of deflection<br>
members 16 increases, and the potential horizontal displacement of the<br>
gondola 14 is accordingly lower, whereas when the distance between the<br>
gondola 14 and a wind turbine 12 increases, the amount of sag in the cable<br>
connection 10 and the holding cable 24 increases. In the middle of the<br>
stretch between two wind turbines 12, the sag is at its greatest, and hence<br>
the potential horizontal displacement of the gondola 14 is at its maximum.<br>
Figure 6 shows an enlarged view of the portions enclosed by a broken<br>
circular line in Figure 4 and Figure 5. The cable connection 10 is formed by<br>
two cables 20, 22. The upper cable 20 is provided as a main cable and<br>
carries the gondola 14 which is moveably disposed thereon with two guide<br><br><br><br>
sheaves 46. The lower cable 22 is a traction cable and is fixedly attached to<br>
the gondola 14. By operating said traction cable 22, the gondola 14 can be<br>
moved in a suspended position along the main cable.<br>
Figures 7 and 8 show a wind turbine 12 (Figure 7) and a portion of the tower<br>
of the wind turbine 12 (Figure 8) with a cover 34 of substantially horizontal<br>
extension disposed thereon. Figure 7 is a plan view and Figure 8 a side<br>
elevation view.<br>
The cable connection 10 runs below said cover 34; the means by which it is<br>
suspended is not shown here for the sake of a better overview. Protective<br>
walls 36 are disposed on each of the two sides of the cover 34 that run<br>
parallel to the cable connection 10.<br>
In combination with the cover 34, these protective walls 36 form a protective<br>
roof that protects the gondola 14 and the opening 18 in the tower of the wind<br>
turbine 12 against the weather. Said protective roof extends on both sides of<br>
the opening 18, parallel to the cable connection 10.<br>
The outer ends of the protective roof are widened, due to the fact that, while<br>
the gondola is travelling between two wind turbines 12, horizontal<br>
displacement of the gondola 14 is possible at all times, albeit limited in<br>
amount and direction. The spacing between the protective walls 36 increases<br>
in predefined portions of the protective roof with increasing distance from the<br>
opening 18. In the middle portion, near the opening 18, the dimensions of the<br>
protective roof can be substantially equal to those of the gondola 14.<br>
By means of the greater spacing between the protective walls 36, the<br>
gondola 14 can be moved between the protective walls and hence into their<br>
lee side, even when, for example, the gondola is horizontally displaced by<br>
cross winds. Owing to the shelter from the wind thus provided, the gondola<br><br>
14 is no longer displaced and for this reason the spacing between the protective walls<br>
36, 38 can be made smaller.<br>
Elastic coatings 48 are provided on the protective walls 36, 38 in the entry area, said<br>
coatings being intended to dampen any collision of the gondola 14 with the protective<br>
walls 36, 38 in such a way at least that no significant damage occurs. Independently of<br>
these coatings 48 on the protective walls 36, 38, similar coatings can be provided on the<br>
gondola, for example in the form of fenders.<br>
Another embodiment (not shown) comprises a wind farm with an offshore platform and<br>
the wind turbines of the wind farm. For the sake of simplicity, the cable connection<br>
between the wind turbines themselves are not shown (see Figure 3 or Figure 2 instead).<br>
As can be seen here, there is a cable connection between the offshore platform and at<br>
least one wind turbine that is centrally allocated in the wind farm to the platform. Another<br>
possible configuration (see Figure 2) is a star-shaped arrangement of the cable<br>
connection between the platform and the wind turbines, wherein the platform then forms<br>
the centre of the star-shaped network.<br>
As on previously known offshore oil-drilling platforms, all the facilities enabling people to<br>
stay on the platform for extended periods can be accommodated on the platform. These<br>
include, in particular, living quarters, sleeping quarters, mess rooms and all other<br>
facilities that also enable the wind farm maintenance and operating personnel to stay for<br>
several weeks at a time.<br>
In addition, the platform itself can be equipped with electrolysis equipment<br>
(this can also be provided on a separate platform) so that water can be<br>
converted electrolytically into its constituent elements, oxygen and hydrogen,<br>
using the power generated by the wind turbines of the wind farm. Both<br><br>
gases, in any case the hydrogen gas, is then stored in gas tanks provided in<br>
the platform or separately thereto, or the gas produced is conveyed to land<br>
by means of pipelines. When the gas is stored on the platforms, it can be<br>
collected by suitable transport ships.<br>
The special advantage of such hydrogen production is that fluctuating power<br>
generation due to varying wind conditions is of no concern, because the gas<br>
tanks provide an adequate buffer that permits continuous transportation of<br>
gas despite fluctuating production output.<br>
Given that the production of hydrogen from water makes sense only if<br>
renewable energy is used, a very large production capacity can be provided<br>
with the wind farm, because the electrical power output of the wind farm is<br>
in the order of several megawatts, and preferably in excess of 500 MW.<br>
The platforms themselves are also so large, generally, that they are fitted<br>
with a special helicopter landing pad, such that people can be transported to<br>
the wind farm by helicopter and that the helicopters can land relatively safely<br>
on the platforms on account of their substantial size.<br>
The cableway connection of the invention between the platforms and at least<br>
one wind turbine also has the advantage that, in the event of an accident on<br>
the residential platform, the personnel can still move to the wind turbine,<br>
where it is firstly in safety.<br>
In order to avoid any collision between passing ships and the gondola, the<br>
gondolas and/or the cables are also fitted with an anti-collision light that is<br>
switched on unavoidably on at least one moving gondola, thus attracting a<br>
very high level of attention on the part of any passing ships.<br><br>
It is also possible to provide technical facilities that permit the gap between<br>
the gondola and an obstruction to be detected, i.e. using radar or<br>
ultrasound..<br>
In order to receive a certain advance warning, the boundaries of the wind<br>
farm or sections of the wind farm, for example, can also be monitored for<br>
entry of a watercraft. This can be effected with visual monitoring means, or<br>
with radar equipment or the like. In combination with such a means, a forced<br>
control can be activated when a ship is detected entering the wind farm,<br>
wherein said control forces the gondolas to travel to the nearest wind<br>
turbine, so that any collision can be safety prevented. At the same time,<br>
standard warning messages can be transmitted to the ship"s bridge over<br>
certain radio channels, such as the emergency channel, warning them of the<br>
hazard.<br><br>
In order to help sailors or water sportspeople after an accident at sea using<br>
the gondolas, the gondolas can also be equipped with safety equipment such<br>
as jack ladders, winches for rescue seats or the like, and first-aid equipment<br>
or similar.<br>
The platform can also be a life-saver for people shipwrecked in the area of<br>
the wind farm, in particular when an injured or freezing person on the high<br>
seas can be taken care of on the platform to such an extent that initial<br>
recovery can occur. It is advantageous in this context if there is basic<br>
medical equipment and supplies on the platform, so that primary or<br>
minimum medical treatment can be assured.<br><br>
