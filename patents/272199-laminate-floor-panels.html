LAMINATE FLOOR PANELS<br>
Technical field<br>
The invention generally relates to the field of flooring systems and laminated floor panels, which could be installed in advanced  patterns especially such floor panels, which are possible to lock and unlock with mechanical locking systems. The invention concerns an improvement of 'the -flooring system and -floor panels described in WO 03/089736<br>
Field of Application of the Invention-<br>
The present invention is particularly suitable for use in floating floors, which are not attached to the sub floor and which are formed of floor panels joined mechanically with a locking system integrated with the floor panel, i.e. mounted at the factory, are made up of one or more upper layers of printed and structured materials such as decorative laminate or decorative plastic material, an intermediate core of wood fibre based material or plastic material and preferably a lower balancing layer on the rear side of the core. The following description of prior art technique, problems of known systems and objects and features of the invention will therefore, as a non restrictive example, be aimed above all at this field of application and in particular laminate flooring.<br>
  It should be emphasized that the invention can be used in any floor panel and it could be combined with all types of known locking system, where the floor panels are intended to be joined using a mechanical locking system connecting the panels in the horizontal and vertical<br>
  directions on at least two adjacent sides. The invention can thus also be applicable to, for instance, solid<br>
 <br>
wooden floors, parquet floors with a core of wood or wood fibre based material and a surface of wood or wood veneer and the like, floors with a printed and preferably also varnished surface, floors with a surface layer of plastic or cork, linoleum, rubber or similar. Even floors with hard surfaces such as stone, tile and similar are included and floorings with soft wear layer, for instance needle felt glued to a board. The principle could also be used on floors, which are glued or nailed to the sub floor.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Laminate flooring usually comprise rectangular floor panels with a core of a 6-12 mm fibreboard, a 0.2-0.8 mm thick upper decorative surface layer of laminate and a 0.1-0.6 ram thick lower balancing layer of laminate, plastic, paper or like material. A laminate surface comprises a printed melamine impregnated paper, which is pressed with an embossed sheet. The most common core material is fibreboard with high density and good stability usually called HDF - High Density Fibreboard. Sometimes also MDF - Medium Density Fibreboard - is used as core.<br>
Traditional laminate floor panels of this type have taken a large market share mainly due to the fact that advanced printing and pressing technology has made it possible to make very natural copies of mainly wood parquet floorings. Laminate floorings look like wood, but are more durable and less expensive- than wood floorings.<br>
In addition to such traditional floors, which have been install with a tongue and groove joint and with glue, floor panels have been developed which do not require the<br>
 <br>
use of glue and instead are joined mechanically by means of so called mechanical locking systems.<br>
These systems comprise locking means, which lock the panels horizontally and vertically. The mechanical locking systems are usually formed by machining of the core of the panel. Alternatively, parts of the locking system can be formed of a separate material, for instance aluminium or HDF, -which is integrated with the floor panel, i.e. joined with the floor panel in connection with the manufacture thereof.<br>
The main advantages of floating floors with mechanical locking systems are that they are easy to install. They can also easily be taken up again and used once more at a different location.<br>
Definition of Some Terms<br>
By "horizontal plane or principal plane" is meant a plane, which extends parallel to the outer part of the surface layer, immediately juxtaposed upper parts of two adjacent joint edges of two joined floor panels together define a "vertical plane (V)" perpendicular to the horizontal plane. By "horizontally" is meant parallel to the horizontal plane and by "vertically" parallel to the vertical plane<br>
By "locking systems" are meant co acting connecting means, which connect the floor panels vertically and/or horizontally. By "mechanical locking system" is meant that joining can take place without glue.<br>
By a "discontinuous surface layer and core" is meant -the surface layer and core of two elements connected to each othe-r to form one panel or two panels connected to each other to form a floor and consequently the core and the<br>
<br>
 <br>
surface layer of the elements and the panels respectively is discontinuous. A joint is detectable between the two element or panels at the discontinuity.<br>
Prior Art Technique and Problems thereof<br>
Printing and pressing technology have in recent years been developed further and very natural copies of stone, tiles and parquet strips have been introduced on the market.<br>
There are however a lot of designs and patterns which are not possible to produce and install with the present printing, pressing and mechanical locking technology.<br>
Most designs which contain patterns or structures where parts have to be aligned with the format of the floor panel are difficult to produce since swelling and shrinking of the printed paper and the positioning of the printing paper and the press sheet are difficult to control. Joints, which cross a specific pattern, which is design to be one unite, gives an unnatural appearance.<br>
It is known that some advanced patterns could be produced with individual rectangular small floor panels, which could be connected to floor units. Such patterns and floor panels are described in WO 03/08973. This known technology is not suitable for patterns, which aim to copy for example advanced stone and tile floors. US 6,729,091 describe small panels with polygonal shape. These panels are very difficult and costly to produce and time consuming and difficult to install.<br>
Brief Description of the-Invention and Objects thereof<br>
A first overall objective of the present invention is to provide a flooring system and floor panels, with<br>
 <br>
preferably mechanical locking systems, which could be installed in advanced patterns and where the pattern to a large extent is obtained by the size, shape and mechanical working of the panels and the elements and not only by printing and pressing technology.<br>
More specifically the object is to provide a flooring system and floor panels with mechanical locking system where one or several of the following advantages are obtained.<br>
The floor panel should preferably be possible to assemble mechanically to a floor surface which generally only could be obtained with small individual wood, tile or stone pieces with different sizes or xion parallel edges and with panels, which are not floating but glued or nailed to the- sub floor<br>
The floor panels should be easy to install in spite of the fact that the floor pattern could comprise a lot of small floor panels with different sizes and advanced shapes, which differ from the traditional rectangular panels.<br>
The substantial waste, which is required in order to produce floor panels and mechanical locking system in floors comprising small and non rectangular floor panels, should be reduced as much as possible<br>
The above objects of the invention are achieved wholly or partly by a mechanical locking systems and floor panels, according to the independent claim. Embodiments of the invention are evident from the dependent claims and from the description and drawings.<br>
According to the invention, a flooring system is provided comprising a plurality of floor panels with a core and a<br>
<br>
 <br>
discontinuous surface layer.  The floor panels are mechanically connectable to each other along one pair of adjacent edges and each floor panel comprises at least two floor elements whereof at least one of the floor elements is non rectangular.<br>
The floor elements are factory connected to a floor panel and delivered as floor panels preferably in a package to the installation place as parts of a pre installed floor. The connection between floor elements should be such that several floor elements are kept in a pre determined position in relation to each other during installation. This connection could be such that floor elements are permanently connected with -for instance glue or mechanical locking system, which keeps the floor elements in a correct position during installation.<br>
A floor panel, which is formed of several individual floor elements, offers a lot of advantages. Patterns could be created which are not possible to produce with printing or linear machining of the edges. Installation is easy since several floor elements could be installed at the same time. The joint between the floor elements could be rather simple and cheep but still strong and reliable since the floor elements are connected in the factory where suitable equipment could be used. The floor is to a large extent pre-installed at the factory and the individual elements could be connected to each other in a very efficient way. A lot of time consuming and difficult installation work where the floor installer has to work close to the floor, could be moved to a controlled factory environment.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Figs la-4b illustrate prior art locking systems.<br>
<br>
 <br>
Figs 4c-5 illustrate a first embodiment of the invention<br>
Figs 6a-9d illustrate embodiments of the invention.<br>
Description of Embodiments of the Invention<br>
To facilitate understanding, several floor panels and locking systems in the figures are shown schematically. It should be emphasized that improved or different functions can be achieved using combinations of the preferred embodiments. The inventor has tested all known and especially all commercially used locking systems on the market in all type of floor panels, especially laminate and wood floorings and the conclusion is that at least all these known locking systems which have one or more tongues and grooves or locking elements cooperating with locking grooves could be used to connect floor elements to a floor panel and to connect the floor panels to a floor.<br>
Angles, dimensions, rounded parts etc are only examples and could be adjusted within the principles of the invention.<br>
Figures la - lc show known mechanical locking systems, which could be lock-ed with angling and/or snapping. These locking systems have a tongue 10 and a grove 9 for vertical locking of adjacent edges parallel to the vertical plane V and a locking grove 12 and a locking element 8 for horizontal locking parallel with the horizontal plane H. The locking element could be located on a tongue- 10 or a strip 6.<br>
Figures 2a-2c show mechanical locking systems, which could be locked by horizontal snapping. The locking elements could be made in one piece with the core as in figure 2c or of a separate material, hereafter referred<br>
 <br>
to as two piece snap, as in figure 2a and 2b. These snap systems have a low snapping resistance and a high locking strength and are therefore very suitable to use in floor panels according to the invention.<br>
Figure 3a - 3c show mechanical locking systems which could be locked by a vertical folding. Such systems could have means for horizontal locking only, as in figure 3^, hereafter referred to as vertical hook systems or they could have a small tongue 10 made in one piece, as in figure 3b, hereafter referred to as vertical tongue systems. Alternative the tongue 10 could be flexible as in figure 3c. Such vertical folding with a tongue, which is displaceable horizontally, is very suitable to use in the floor panels according to the invention. Such systems are referred to a flex tongue systems.<br>
Fig. 4a-4b show traditional locking systems, which are locked vertically with a tongue 10 and a grove 9 and horizontally with glue 7. Figure 4c show how a tongue and groove joint could be adjusted to be used in a factory connection of floor elements. The tongue 10 has been made smaller since special glue -with controlle-d equipment could be used. The under lip 6 has been made slightly longer and extends beyond the upper lip 6'. This simplifies the application of glue and the under lip 6 could be formed such that it creates a vertical pre tension and keeps the floor element together until the glue cures.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates schematically a cross section of a floor panel 2, which comprises two separate floor elements 1, 1', which have been factory connected with a tongue and groove locking system. The floor panel 2 has a surface layer 31 and a core 30, which are discontinuous,<br>
 <br>
and edges, which in this preferred embodiment could be locked with angling. The floor elements have a decorative groove 40, bevel or similar on one edge. When floor elements are connected to floor panels very advance grove patterns could be obtained which are not possible to produce in a cost efficient way if the are to be made in an individual traditional floor panel.<br>
All these locking systems could be used in various combinations to connect floor elements 1, 1' or two or several adjacent edges of floor panels. Mechanical locking systems could be adjusted to lock for example floor elements with a simple snapping which only holds the panels together until the glue cures. Preferred embodiments to lock floor elements are locking systems using glue, since the panels could easily be positioned correctly horizontally to each other in the factory. Floor elements could also be connected with tape on the rear side or glued to a underlay 16 which could be a foam, a cork layer, various types of plastic materials, wood based sheet materials or wood veneer or similar.<br>
Figure 6 a shows two non rectangular floor elements 1, 1' , which are connected to a floor element 2 as shown in figure 6a-b. The floor elements could have a surface of the same material, for example laminate, but they could also have a surface layers of different materials for example laminate-wood, plastic material-laminate, Cork -wood etc. More than two different materials could be combined. The floor elements have decorative grooves 40 on three edges. An advanced floor panel with decorative groves, which in this embodiment meet each other at an angle different than 90 degree, could be produced with linear machining.<br>
 <br>
Figure 6d show how floor panels 2 could be installed in the order of A-H with combinations of angling, snapping and vertical folding. Rather simple locking systems could be used since the irregular shape of the panels could be used to prevent displacement along the length direction of the panels.<br>
Figure 6e shows a floor with an advanced pattern according to the invention. Such a floor could be installed just as easy as traditional rectangular floor panels. It is obvious that 6, 8 or more floor elements could be connected to a floor panel. Start and end pieces with straight edges could be supplied.<br>
It is also obvious that all embodiments could be used to provide a floor where the floor panels are made of a single floor element. Practical testing show however that a floor panel comprising 4 floor elements could be install more than 4 times faster than if the floor was installed with floor panels comprising only one floor element _<br>
Figure 7a shows a floor element 1 which is used to form a floor panel 2 similar to the floor panel in figure 6. The floor panel 2 has 9 pairs (4a-4i and 5a -5i) of edges. The floor panel 2 comprises 6 pairs (4c-d 4d-e, 4g-h, 5b-c, 5e-f and 5f-g) of adjacent edges, which are inclined with .an angle (A) of more than 90 degrees-<br>
The panels could be locked in several ways. The parallel edges (4b-5b, 4d-5d, 4f-5f,and 4h-5h could for example have a one or a two piece snap system and the other edges could have a traditional tongue and groove system. Alternatively all edges could be locked with horizontal snapping.<br>
 <br>
Two pairs of adjacent edges (4b-5b and 4f-5f) could have an angling system and two pairs (4d-5d and 4h-5h) could have a flex tongue system. All other edges could have a vertical hook system or a vertical tongue system or a flex tongue system or any other system that allows vertical folding.<br>
The floor panel comprises two protrusions (PI, P2) with straight edges, which are positioned along a straight line L. Such protrusions will block mutual displacement of connected panels. The straight edges 4b, 4f of these protrusions could have a mechanical locking system, which could be locked with angling to opposite parallel edges 5b, 5f of a similar panel. The other edges could be locked with vertical folding.<br>
Figures 7c-7f show different embodiments according to the same principles. In figure 7d nine pairs of adjacent edges (4a-4i and 5a-5i) could be connected to each other and two pairs of adjacent edges (4c-5b and 4g-5f) could for example be connected with angling. In figure 7f<br>
I  eleven pairs of adjacent edges (4a-4k and 5a-5k) could be connected to each other and there are three protrusions PI, P2, P3 with three pairs of edges (4d-5a, 4g-5d and 4j-5g) which could be connected with for example angling and the other edges could be connected with for example<br>
i  vertical folding.<br>
All embodiments where some edges are installed with angling and some other with vertical folding allow a very simple installation with one  angling action only around the outer edges (4d, 4g, 4j) which are positioned along )  the straight line L as shown in figure 7f.<br>
As an alternative all edges could be connected with flex tongue systems.<br>
 <br>
As a non-restrictive example it could be mentioned that the edges preferably could have a length of 80 - 200 mm<br>
These embodiments show that the invention makes it possible to connect floor element in a much simpler way and that the shape of the floor panel makes it possible to use other combinations of efficient and simple locking systems than what is possible with traditional locking technology based on individual floor element which are difficult to position and install.<br>
Figures 8a - 8e and 9a-9d show different embodiments. The floor panels according to figure 8d are installed offset to each other while the floor panels in figure 9d are installed side by side in parallel rows.<br>
In embodiments with irregular shape, it is not possible to use the traditional angle, displace and snap method. Therefore preferable installation methods are angling only or snapping only or just a vertical displacement.<br>
The invention could be used to connect tile shaped panes installed on a wall or in furniture components.<br>
