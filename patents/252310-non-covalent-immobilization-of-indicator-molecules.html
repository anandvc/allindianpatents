BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the invention<br>
[0001] The invention relates to immobilization methods and, in particular, for<br>
immobilizing indicator molecules on supports such as optical sensors, and to sensors<br>
having those indicator molecules immobilized on their surfaces.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
[0002]	U.S. Patent No. 5,356,417 describes a fluorescent-based sensing device<br>
comprising indicator molecules and a.photosensitive element, e.g., a photodetector.<br>
Broadly speaking, in the context of the field of the invention, indicator molecules are<br>
molecules where one or more optical characteristics of which is or are affected by the<br>
local presence of an analyte. Indicator molecules have been used to measure a wide<br>
array of analytes, such as glucose, oxygen, toxins, pharmaceuticals or other drugs, •<br>
hormones, and other metabolic analytes. These indicator molecules are often<br>
classified based on the chemical principal on which their activity is based. For example,<br>
the activity of many indicators, such as the one described in U.S. Patent No. 6,344,360,<br>
the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, are based on the principle<br>
of luminescence, in particular fluorescence. U.S. Patent No. 6,344,360 describes a<br>
fluorescent indicator molecule containing a fluorescent lanthanide metal chelate<br>
complex whose fluorescence emission intensity is increased by the presence of certain<br>
sugars. Other categories of indicator molecules include colorimetric indicator molecules<br><br>
which change their color in the presence of an analyte and indicator molecules which<br>
change absorbency at a particular wavelength.<br>
[0003]	Indicator molecules vary widely in their chemical compositions and<br>
properties. For example, indicator molecules may be monomeric or polymeric and/or<br>
hydrophilic or hydrophobic.<br>
[0004]	Indicator molecules have been immobilized on supports, such as sensor<br>
surfaces, by attaching the indicator molecule at the surface of the support.<br>
Immobilizing indicator molecules on inert polymeric substrates poses a particular<br>
challenge, since those substrates have to be modified to create or chosen to provide<br>
attachment points for the indicator molecules.<br>
[0005]	Molecules can be immobilized on a substrate in different ways.<br>
Immobilization is often based on covalent links between the substrate and the<br>
immobilized molecule. To facilitate immobilization, inert substrates are generally<br>
avoided, as those require pretreatments, e.g., with U.V. or with harsh acids :;uch as<br>
nitric acid to achieve oxidation of the substrate to create reactive sites. These<br>
pretreatments are generally associated with undesirables, such as instability of the<br>
immobilization product or the handling of harsh acids. Thus, more readily modifiable<br>
supports, such as polyacrylamide supports, are generally chosen to attach molecules of<br>
interest. A polyacrylamide support can, for example, be readily modified, for example,<br>
by attaching through reactive amine groups, which enables attachment of a wide variety<br>
of molecules, including haptenes, peptides, carbohydrates and oligonucleotides.<br><br>
 [0006]	The immobilization of molecules, such as indicator molecules, on optical<br>
sensors poses some unique challenges. For example, it is important that the<br>
immobilization method does not interfere with the function of the optical sensor. Also,<br>
certain immobilization methods might result in the discoloration of a support and thus,<br>
interfere with its function as optical waveguide. Known immobilization methods can<br>
also change the optical properties of the surface by, e.g., causing bubbling or rippling of<br>
the surface, thus disrupting the optical path of a sensor or adversely affect material<br>
properties. Thus, there is a continuing need for improvements in the way indicator<br>
molecules are immobilized on an immobilization substrate. This need is particularly<br>
conspicuous in the context of immobilizing indicator molecules on sensor bodies, in<br>
particular on optical sensor bodies, used as long term implants.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0007]	In a first aspect, the present invention is directed to a method for non-<br>
covalently attaching a macromolecular indicator molecule to a support. This method<br>
comprises (a) providing a support surface comprising at least one polymer, (b) changing<br>
the integrity of the polymer to provide loosened polymer chains that form at least one<br>
interlacing area, (c) providing at least one macromolecular indicator or monomers<br>
thereof, (d) causing the macromolecular indicator or polymerization products of<br>
monomers thereof to interlace with the interlacing areas, and (e) causing the loosened<br>
polymer chains to tighten to produce surface'immobilized indicator molecules. In this<br>
first aspect of the present invention, the macromolecular indicator molecule in (c) may<br>
be a partially or fully polymerized indicator molecule. Alternatively, the monomers of the<br><br>
at least one macromolecular indicator molecules in (c) may be sequentially polymerized<br>
in (d) to form a sequential IPN (interpenetrating polymer network).<br>
[0008]	The polymer chains may be loosened by a solvent such as, for example,<br>
ethanol, 2-methoxyethanol, dimethylforrnamide, a monomer of a hydrophilic<br>
macromolecular indicator such as HEMA or mixtures thereof. The polymer chains may<br>
be tightened again by the removal of the solvent or by polymerization of the monomer<br>
into the hydrophilic macromolecular indicator, respectively. In this aspect of the<br>
invention, the support surface may be hydrophobic and the macromolecular indicator<br>
molecule may be hydrophilic. The support may be the surface of a sensor or an optical<br>
waveguide. The macromolecular indicator molecule may have one or more reference<br>
regions. These reference regions may be excimer regions or may comprise or consist<br>
of at least one reference molecule. The macromolecular indicator molecule may also<br>
comprise one or more crosslinkers, which in turn crosslink the macromolecular indicator<br>
molecule within the support.<br>
[009J In a second aspect, the present invention is directed to a graft. The graft<br>
preferably comprises a surface including at least one polymer and a macromolecular<br>
indicator molecule. The graft is characterized in that the macromolecular indicator<br>
molecule is stably interlaced between at least one chain of at least one of the polymers<br>
of the support. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
macromolecular indicator molecule in the graft has certain properties that substantially<br>
correspond to the properties of an identical macromolecular indicator molecule that is<br>
not part of a graft (native molecule). Those properties may include, but are not limited<br><br>
to, the molecule's affinity to an analyte or its reference regions, such as excimer<br>
regions, which, in the native molecule, may be a result of the molecule's primary and/or<br>
tertiary structure. The surface of the graft may be a sensor.<br>
[0010]	In a third aspect, the present invention is directed to another method for<br>
non-covalently attaching an indicator molecule to a sensor. The method comprises (a)<br>
providing a support having a surface comprising at least one strong ionic group, (b)<br>
adding to the surface at least one indicator molecule comprising at least one charged<br>
residue having a charge opposite of that of the ionic group, (c) immobilizing the<br>
indicator molecule on the support via an. ionic bond between the ionic group of the<br>
support and the at least one charged residue. The ionic group, for example, may be an<br>
anionic group, in particular, a sulfonate. The at least one charged residue, for example,<br>
may be a positively charged residue. The ionic group may be part of a copolymer of, for<br>
example, sulfonate and methyl methacrylate, which forms a coat on the surface of the<br>
support.<br>
[0011]	In a fourth aspect, the present invention is directed to a sensor for<br>
determining the presence or concentration of an analyte within a medium. The sensor<br>
comprises a sensor body preferably having a polymeric outer surface surrounding the<br>
sensor body, and a macromolecular indicator molecule which, in response to the<br>
presence of an analyte in the medium, changes at least one measurable characteristic.<br>
The sensor further comprises a detector which detects radiation from the indicator<br>
molecules and which generates an electrical signal which corresponds to the changes<br>
in at least one characteristic of the indicator molecule which is indicative of the<br><br><br>
presence or concentration of the analyte. In this sensor, the macromolecuiar indicator<br>
molecule may be stably interlaced between at least one chain of at least one of the<br>
polymer chains of the sensor surface. The sensor may be an optical sensor which is<br>
adapted to detect one or more analytes of interest in a medium, such as glucose. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the surface of the sensor may be made from<br>
polymethylmethacrylate.<br><br><br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[0022]	The support for an indicator molecule, such as a sensor device, has to<br>
meet certain design requirements. In the case of an optical sensor housing,<br>
translucency and durability are generally desirable. As a result, the surface of a<br>
support, which may be made of a material that can act as an optical waveguide, often<br><br><br>
has a set of properties that is very different from the properties of the indicator molecule<br><br>
that is desired to be attached to that surface. This set of properties is also often<br>
different from the environment in which the sensor operates. For example, the support<br>
is often very hydrophobic (e.g. for the protection of the microelectronics within the<br>
 sensor) while an indicator molecule can be very hydrophiiic. This is especially desirable<br>
if analytes are detected in an aqueous medium. Certain embodiments of the present<br>
invention are directed at achieving effective immobilization of indicator molecules,<br>
including macromolecular indicator molecules, despite the differences in the properties<br>
of the support and the indicator molecule, and without adversely affecting the<br>
performance of the indicator molecule. Certain embodiments of the present invention<br>
actually take advantage of these differences, enhance them and/or even create them to<br>
achieve immobilization.<br>
[0023]	A wide variety of indicator molecules can be used in the context of the<br>
present invention. An indicator molecule according to the present invention is a<br>
molecule having at least one characteristic, such as fluorescence, that is affected fay the<br>
local presence of an analyte. Such an indicator molecule can base its activity on any<br>
number of principles including, but not limited to, luminescence, such as fluorescence<br>
and phosphorescence, absorbance or colorimetrics. The indicator molecules of the<br>
' present invention include monomelic molecules as well as macromolecular indicator<br>
molecules, such as water soluble macromolecular indicator molecules. For example,<br>
the compounds described in U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 10/187,903 and in U.S.<br>
Patent Publication Nos. 2002/0127626 or 2003/0082663, which have at least two<br><br><br>
recognition elements for glucose, can be used in the context of the invention. Further,<br>
the fluorescent lanthanide metal complexes described in U.S. Patent No. 6,344,360 or<br>
the fluorescent phenylboronic compounds of U.S. Patent No. 5,503,770 also can be<br>
used in the context of the present invention. The disclosures of these patents and<br>
applications are incorporated herein by reference. However, as the person skilled in the<br>
art will appreciate, any other suitable indicator molecule can be used as well.<br>
[0024]	The indicator molecules of the present invention are generally specific for<br>
one or more analytes. For example, in a preferred embodiment, the indicator molecules<br>
are specific for glucose, in other embodiments, the indicator molecules are specific for<br>
oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitric oxide, toxins, pH, ions and mono-or divalent cations.<br>
However, as the person skilled in the art will appreciate, a wide variety of other analytes<br>
can be detected and/or measured using the present invention.<br>
[0025]	In certain embodiments of the present invention, monomeric molecules<br>
such as those described in the above-mentioned patents and applications, are<br>
converted into macromolecular .indicator molecules, including water soluble<br>
macromolecular indicator molecules, by polymerization in the presence of expanded<br>
substrate polymer, or attachment to a polymer. "Macromolecular indicator molecules"<br>
or "macromolecular indicators" according to the present invention are molecules acting<br>
as indicator molecules, and are macromolecular from, for example, being partially or<br>
fully polymerized, for example, copolymerized, with one or more molecules of another<br>
type. A polymer, in the context of the present invention, includes any product of the<br>
polymerization of monomers, complex or simple ones, as well as oligomers. "Water<br><br><br>
soluble macromolecular indicator molecules" (WSMIM) according to the present<br>
invention are macromolecular indicator molecules which are overall substantially<br>
hydrophiiic. In order to obtain a WSMIM, suitable recognition monomers can be co-<br>
polymerized with hydrophiiic monomers. Examples of suitable hydrophiiic monomers<br>
include, but are not limited to, methacrylamides, certain methacrylates, vinyls,<br>
polysaccharides, polyamides, polyamino acids, hydrophilic silanes or siloxanes, HEMA<br>
(hydroxyethyi methacrylate) or other common hydrogel constituents as well as mixtures<br>
of two or more different monomers. Examples of macromolecular indicator molecules<br>
produced by co- polymerization of a monomeric indicator molecule with a hydrophiiic<br>
monomer are described in U.S. Patent Publications Nos. 2003/0013204,<br>
2003/0013202, 2003/0008408, 2003/0003592, 2002/0039793 and in U.S. Patent<br>
Application No. .10/187,903, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0026]	The nature and ratio of suitable hydrophiiic monomers will vary according<br>
to a number of factors described, for example, in Patent Publication No. 2003/0013204.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the water soluble macromolecular indicator molecule is a<br>
copolymer of 2-hydroxy methacrylate (HEMA) and bis-carboxylate bis-boronate-<br>
anthracene. In yet another preferred embodiment, the water soluble macromolecular<br>
indicator molecule is a copolymer of methacrylamidopropyltrimethylammonium chloride<br>
(MAPTAC) and bis-carboxylate bis-boronate-anthracene at ratios between<br>
approximately 5:1 to 80:1.<br>
[0027]	In a preferred embodiment, the macromolecular indicator molecules of the<br>
present invention have reference regions such as excimer regions, which are also<br><br><br>
referred to as excimer emission regions. "Excimer regions" according to the present<br>
invention refers to the region of a macromolecular indicator molecule that provides an<br>
excimer effect. Sequence specific excimer regions exist as a direct result of the primary<br>
structure of a molecule. However, adoption of its tertiary structure (3-D configuration)<br>
may create additional excimer regions in a molecule. "An excimer effect" in the context<br>
of the present invention refers to a characteristic longer wavelength emission of a<br>
molecule having excimer regions. The molecular basis of an excimer effect is<br>
described, for example, in U.S. Publication No. 2003/0013204, incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
[0028] As described therein, an excimer region is not responsive to changes in<br>
analyte concentration, but is responsive to other aspects of the system analyzed, such-<br>
as excitation intensity, temperature, and pH. As a result, an indicator molecule having<br>
excimer regions may serve as both an indicator and an internal reference. For<br>
example, the emission intensity at the indicator wavelength (i.e., the wavelength<br>
influenced by the analyte) can," via select bandpass filters, be separated optically from<br>
the emission intensity at the excimer wavelength. The resultant value corrects for<br>
interfering factors which affect fluorescent emission properties, such as fluorescent<br>
quenching by, for example, oxygen, drift, photobleaching, degradation and error in pH<br>
etc. Indicator molecules having excimer regions are particularly useful for applications<br>
involving long-term implantation, as ambient conditions in any long-term in vivo<br>
application are bound to be subject to frequent change. Accordingly, molecules with<br>
excimer regions are part of a preferred embodiment of the present invention. U.S.<br>
Patent Publications'Nos. 2003/0013204, 2003/0013202, 2003/0008408, 2003/0003592<br><br><br>
and 2002/0039793, incorporated herein by reference, describe examples of such<br>
molecules.<br>
[0029]	In another embodiment of the present invention, the macromolecular<br>
indicator molecules comprise one or more reference molecules. Reference molecules<br>
are, for example, fluorescent molecules that emit at wavelengths different from the<br>
respective indicator molecule and are not responsive to changes in analyte<br>
concentration, but responsive to other aspects of the system analyzed, such as<br>
excitation intensity, temperature, and pH.<br>
[0030]	Figures 1A and 1B show the primary structure and tertiary structure of a<br>
representative WSMIM 100 according to the present invention, respectively. The<br>
tertiary structure of such a molecule is generally governed by the lowest energy<br>
configuration which it may attain in an aqueous environment. The molecule has, in the<br>
embodiment shown, excimer emission regions 101, some of which are created by the<br>
folding of the molecule 102. In those excimer emission regions, two planar molecules<br>
of aromatic structure (e.g. fluorophores) are oriented in copianar configuration and have<br>
overlapping pi-electron orbitals. This results in one or more emissions at a wavelength<br>
that is different from the wavelength characteristic for the parent species 103. For<br>
example, for fluorescent planar species, a characteristic downfield emission occurs in<br>
comparison to that of the uncoupled species at a wavelength of substantially lower<br>
energy than the uncoupled species. As described above, this characteristic emission<br>
can be used to compensate for variable ambient conditions.<br><br><br>
[0031]	in certain embodiments of the present invention, indicator molecules<br>
having at least one strong positively or negatively charged moiety at a suitable pH are<br>
preferred. The pH that allows a moiety to carry a strong negative or positive charge<br>
depends directly on the nature of the moiety. In a preferred embodiment, the moiety<br>
may be chosen according to the environment in which the indicator molecule is used.<br>
Accordingly, a "suitable pH", in a preferred embodiment, may be the prevailing pH in<br>
the environment of choice. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, for in vivo applications of<br>
sensors that are submerged in prevailingly neutral bodily fluids, indicator molecules that<br>
are strongly ionic at neutral pH are preferred. For example, at pH values near neutral,<br>
amine moieties are strongly positively charged and can form a strong ionic bond with a<br>
sulfonate that is strongly negatively charged at this pH.<br>
[0032]	The indicator molecules may be indicator molecules that inherently<br>
contain strongly positively or negatively charged moieties at a suitable pH or indicator<br>
molecules that have been modified to include such moieties by, for example, attaching<br>
them to a molecule that contains one or more strong positively or negatively charged<br>
moieties, such as MAPTAC or 2-Acryloxyethyltrimethylammonium chloride.<br>
[0033]	Figures 5A and 5B show representative cationic macromolecular indicator<br>
molecules containing one or more strong positively charged moieties. In particular,<br>
Figure 5A illustrates a cationic macromolecular indicator molecule 510 containing a<br>
plurality of strong positively charged moieties 511. Figure 5B illustrates a cationic<br>
macromolecular indicator molecule 520 having one strong positively charged moiety<br>
522. The molecule of Figure 5A is positively charged as a result of a large number of<br><br><br>
positively charged moieties, such as amine moieties, which are distributed over the<br>
entire molecule 510. In contrast, the molecule 520 of Figure 5B contains only a<br>
terminal positive charge 522, for example, in the form of an amine moiety. As indicated<br>
by the letter "n" in both figures, the molecules can be substantially longer than depicted<br>
in these figures. The illustrated indicator molecules also have excimer emission<br>
regions 101 that are present in the primary structure of the molecule. The advantages<br>
of using indicator molecules having such regions has been described above.<br>
[0034]	In a preferred embodiment, the support on which an indicator molecule is<br>
immobilized (hereinafter "immobilization support") is a sensor. Examples of suitable<br>
sensors are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,517,313; 5,910,661; 5,894,351, whose<br>
disclosures are incorporated herein by reference. Examples of suitable implantable<br>
sensors are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,330,464; 6,011,984; 6,304,766; 6,400,974<br>
and Patent Application Publication No. 2002/0026108, the disclosures of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference. However, as the person skilled in the art can<br>
appreciate, other sensors may be used.<br>
[0035]	In a preferred embodiment, an immobilization support may be formed<br>
from an optically transmissive polymer material. Preferred polymer materials include,<br>
but are not limited to, acrylic polymers such as polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA),<br>
polyhydroxypropylmethacrylate, polystyrene, and polycarbonates such as those sold<br>
under the trademark LEXAN. The most preferred material is PMMA.<br>
[0036] Sensors and supports having indicator molecules attached to them<br>
according to the present invention can be used in a wide variety of fields. For example,<br><br><br>
they can be used to detect sub-levels or supra-levels of glucose in physiological buffers<br>
or fluids, such as blood, plasma, serum, interstitial fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, urine,<br>
saliva, intraocular fluid, lymph, tears, or sweat, thus providing valuable information for<br>
diagnosing or monitoring such diseases as diabetes and adrenal insufficiency. Other<br>
uses have been described elsewhere, for example, in U.S. Patent Application No.<br>
2003/0082663. However, the sensors and supports having indicator molecules<br>
attached to them according to the present invention are particularly useful for long term<br>
in vivo uses, such as long term implants.<br>
[0037]	Figures 2A and 2B illustrate a representative immobilization support that<br>
may be used in the context of the present invention, in particular, Figures 2A and 2B<br>
show a polymer encasement 204 containing microelectronics 205 of a representative<br>
electro-optical sensing device. The microelectronics 205 may comprise microelectronic<br>
components such as, for example, a radiation source 202 and a detector 201. In one<br>
preferred embodiment, radiation source 202 is an LED, although other radiation<br>
sources may be used. Also in one preferred embodiment, detector 201 is a<br>
photosensitive element (e.g. a photodetector), although other detecting devices may be<br>
used. Microelectronics that may be contained in a representative eiectro-optical<br>
sensing device are described in U.S. Patent No. 6,330,464, the disclosure of which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0038]	As shown in more detail in Figure 2B, the surface 206 of the<br>
immobilization support comprises a polymeric structure 207, such as, for example, the .<br>
chains of PMMA, which are interwoven and intertwined. This polymeric structure<br><br><br>
provides, in one embodiment of the present invention, a hard, solid, hydrophobic<br>
boundary to its surrounding and is inert to reaction.<br>
[0039]	In certain aspects of the present invention, a macromolecular indicator<br>
molecule is interlaced with the support without substantially affecting its properties, in<br>
particular its affinity to an analyte and/or its reference regions, such as excimer regions,<br>
which in the native molecule, are a result of the molecule's primary or tertiary structure.<br>
Maintaining the properties of the indicator molecule will ensure that the detection ability<br>
of the indicator molecule is not negatively affected. In another preferred embodiment,<br>
the macromolecular indicator molecule is attached to the support in a way that makes<br>
its analyte binding regions highly accessible.<br>
[0040]	In one preferred embodiment, the character of the bulk support material is<br>
also substantially preserved after immobilization. This will ensure that a primary<br>
function of the support, for example, the encasement of microelectronics, is not<br>
negatively affected by the immobilization. In a preferred embodiment, this goal is<br>
achieved by relying on non-covalent mechanical interlacing for immobilization.<br>
[0041]	In another preferred embodiment, the indicator molecule is associated<br>
with the support in a way that the diffusion distance of an analyte may be maintained<br>
relatively low. For example, the diffusion distance of an analyte is maintained at<br>
approximately 200 microns or less, preferably 150 microns or less, more preferably 125<br>
microns or less, or the diffusion distances of an analyte may also be maintained at<br>
approximately 80 microns or less, more preferably less than approximately 50 microns<br>
and, in certain instances, as low as approximately 1 micron. Maintaining the diffusion<br><br><br>
distance relatively low will maintain the response time of the sensor to which the<br>
indicator molecule is attached relatively low. For example, response times may be, for<br>
example, less than about 8 minutes, preferably less than about 6 minutes, more<br>
preferably less than about 5 minutes. In one non-limiting embodiment, for the detection<br>
of glucose in an aqueous medium, a diffusion distance of approximately 100 microns or<br>
less and a response time of approximately 5 minutes or less may be desirable. In<br>
another non-limiting embodiment, for the detection of oxygen gas, a diffusion distance<br>
of approximately 50 microns and a response time of approximately 50 milliseconds may<br>
be desirable. Maintaining the response time of the indicator molecule relatively low will<br>
allow, for example, in the case of a sensor, close to real time monitoring of the<br>
concentration and/or presence of a given analyte.<br>
[0042]	In one aspect of the present invention, the macromolecular indicator<br>
molecule that is to be immobilized on a support may be hydrophilic. In a preferred<br>
embodiment of this aspect of the invention, the hydrophilicity of the macromolecular<br>
indicator molecule is substantially maintained after immobilization to the support, in<br>
another preferred embodiment, the macromolecular indicator is associated with the<br>
support in a way that maintains the micro environment of the macromolecular indicator<br>
sufficiently hydrophilic, preferably hydrophilic enough to allow free and saturating<br>
diffusional access to large portions of the entire macromolecular indicator. In yet<br>
another preferred embodiment of this aspect of the invention, the macromolecular<br>
indicator is associated with the support material in a way that minimizes any<br>
hydrophobic influence that a hydrophobic support material will exert on the diffusion<br>
distance of the analyte. In yet another preferred embodiment, the macromolecular<br><br><br>
indicator molecule is, after immobilization, oriented outward into the aqueous<br>
surrounding medium. The above embodiments will ensure that the support-indicator<br>
construct is well adapted for detecting an analyte in an aqueous environment.<br>
[0043]	In optical sensing devices, it is generally desirable to have a clear optical<br>
path and to be able to expose the sensor to a wide array of wavelengths. Accordingly,<br>
one embodiment of the present invention includes a method of immobilizing an<br>
indicator molecule on a sensor without introducing optical impurities, in another<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the immobilized indicator molecule is resistant to<br>
degradation by light at any wavelength to which it will be exposed.<br>
[0044] . in connection with high throughput manufacturing of immobilized indicator<br>
molecules, it is generally desirable that the manufacturing method may be efficient, can<br>
be scaled up, and that the immobilized indicator can withstand manufacturing stresses.<br>
Accordingly, in one embodiment of the present invention, the immobilization method is<br>
highly efficient with respect to indicator usage (immobilization reaction yield) at scale-<br>
up. In another embodiment of the present invention, the immobilization method can be<br>
readily scaled up and the support-indicator construct can be manufactured at high<br>
throughput rates, in yet another embodiment of the present invention, the support-<br>
indicator construct can withstand the sterilization methods and wash cycles it will need<br>
to be exposed to during manufacturing operations.<br>
[0045]	In highly sensitive applications, such as in sensors for in vivo applications,<br>
it is generally desirable that the quality of the product be consistent. Accordingly, in one<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the immobilization method allows for a high<br><br><br>
degree of "sameness," ensuring device-to-device consistency in calibration and signal<br>
processing.<br>
[0046]	Especially in long term applications, such as In sensor implants, it may be<br>
important that the indicator does not negatively affect its surroundings or'is not<br>
inactivated by prevailing ambient-conditions. Accordingly, in one aspect of the present<br>
invention, the immobilized indicator molecule is in intimate and direct association with<br>
the solid surface of the sensor encasement/waveguide, thus preventing significant<br>
leaching of the indicator into the local environment. In another preferred embodiment,<br>
the immobilized indicator molecule is substantially resistant to in vivo degradation, in<br>
yet another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the support-indicator<br>
molecule constructs have sufficient mechanical integrity to withstand forces anticipated<br>
within its intended environment of use.<br>
[0047]	In one aspect of the present invention, a macromoiecular indicator<br>
molecule may be attached to a support by interlacing the macromoiecular indicator with<br>
a polymeric structure on the support forming a graft. A "graft" in the context of the<br>
present invention is an IPN (interpenetrating polymer network) which may be formed by<br>
at least one macromoiecular indicator molecule and at least a portion of a polymer<br>
chain located preferably near the surface of a support network. An IPN, in the context<br>
of the present invention, is a combination of two or more polymers wherein least one is<br>
synthesized and/or crosslinked in the immediate presence of the other without any<br>
covalent bonds between them. As described in more detail below, in a preferred<br>
embodiment, the IPNs of the present invention can be made by sequential<br><br><br>
polymerization resulting in sequential IPNs. in another preferred embodiment, the IPNs<br>
of the present invention are made by interlacing a partially or fully polymerized<br>
macromolecular indicator molecule with the polymeric structure of the support, resulting<br>
in what is called, in the context of the present invention, an interpenetrating polymer<br>
network ("IPN").<br>
[0048]	A first step in producing a graft is to produce interlacing areas at the<br>
surface of the support. An "interlacing area" according to the present invention may be<br>
an area near the surface of a support in which polymer chains of the support have been<br>
loosened to allow interlacing with a partially or fully polymerized macromolecular<br>
indicator molecule or by sequential interpenetrating polymerization.<br>
[0049]	Interlacing areas and grafts can be produced in different ways. For<br>
example, in one embodiment, polymeric chains on the surface of a support are<br>
loosened to form interlacing areas by a monomeric component, preferably a. hydrophilic<br>
monomeric component, such as HEMA (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), of the'<br>
macromolecular indicator molecule that also acts as solvent for the support material. In<br>
one" embodiment of this aspect of the invention, a graft is formed by polymerizing the<br>
hydrophilic monomeric components of the macromolecular indicator molecule that<br>
caused the loosening of the polymer chains on the surface of the support, with the<br>
remaining components of what eventually forms the macromolecular indicator<br>
molecule. Interlacing results from having the polymerization proceed through the<br>
interlacing areas to form a sequential IPN. The polymerization creates a mechanical<br>
lock between the support and the polymerized macromolecular indicator molecule, The<br><br><br>
polymerization of the components of the macromolecular indicator molecule also<br>
causes interlocking with the loosened polymer chains. In accordance with one<br>
embodiment, the polymer chains may be tightened as described, for example, in<br>
connection with Figures 4A and 4B. The tightening of the polymer chains may be<br>
achieved, for example, by removal of the solvent, drying or other means.<br>
[0050]	In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the polymerization<br>
reaction comprises a radical initiator such as, for example, VA-044 (WAKO Chemical<br>
Co., Japan). In yet another preferred embodiment, one or more crosslinkers, such as,<br>
for example, EGDMA (ethylene glycol dimethyiacrylate), TMPTMA (trimethylolpropane<br>
trimethacryjate) or para-toluene sulfonic acid may be added to the polymerization<br>
reaction mix to crosslink the macromolecular indicator molecule within the support In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the crossiinking of the macromolecular indicator molecules<br>
forms loops, while the loosened support material forms another loop which is<br>
interlocked with the loops of the macromolecular indicator molecule(s).<br>
[0051]	The crossiinking of the macromolecular indicator molecules within the<br>
graft is aimed at achieving higher overall reliability of the attachment of the indicator<br>
molecule. In yet another preferred embodiment, the polymerization reaction may be<br>
run within a mold such as a DELRIN© mold similar to the one shown in Figures 6A-6D.<br>
[0052]	In another embodiment of the present invention, which is illustrated in<br>
Figures 3 and 4, a graft is formed by first loosening the support material by a solvent<br>
and having a partially or fully polymerized macromolecular indicator molecule interlace<br>
with the interlacing areas of monomer mixture on the support material. In one<br><br><br>
embodiment, a crosslinker is added to a mix of solvent and the macromoiecuiar<br>
indicator molecules, which links the macromoiecuiar indicator molecules to each other.<br>
While the crosslinking may occur before interlacing, the process will, in certain<br>
embodiments, continue after interlacing has occurred, thus providing additional stability.<br>
[0053]	Figure 3A illustrates a sensor 204 having a polymer encasement for<br>
microelectronics 205 as the immobilization support. Figure 3B is an exploded view of<br>
the surface 206 of such the polymer encasement, in this embodiment, the surface<br>
comprises a tightly interwoven and intertwined long chained polymer such as PMMA.<br>
The arrow pointing from Figure 3B to Figure 3C indicates the transition of the surface of<br>
the encasement material from a tightly interwoven configuration to a loopy<br>
configuration. The loops 308 constitute, in a preferred embodiment, the interlacing<br>
areas. This transition is accomplished by treating the surface with a solvent which may<br>
be, but is not limited to, ethanol, 2-methoxyethanol, DMF (dimethylformamidie), HEMA<br>
or mixtures thereof. However, depending on the support material chosen, the person<br>
skilled in the art will appreciate that any other substance that can attack the surface of<br>
the support to form interlacing areas may be used.<br>
[0054]	Figure 4A shows a surface of the support 206 with interlacing areas 308,<br>
which may be, for example, created in the manner shown in Figures 3A-3C. Figure 4A<br>
also shows a macromolecule, such as a macromoiecuiar indicator molecule 100. The<br>
macromolecule is added with the interlacing area forming substance, or after the<br>
appropriate interlacing area forming substance has created interlacing areas on a<br>
support, to a reaction vessel containing such a support. The macromolecule 100<br><br><br>
interlaces with the interlacing areas 308 by, for example, simple diffusion. To<br>
ac6omp!ish interlacing of the macromoiecular indicator molecules substantially evenly<br>
over the entire surface of support, e.g., such as a bean shaped sensor device as<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 6,330,464, the diffusion is allowed to proceed. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the macromoiecular indicator and the support are both at least<br>
partly soluble in the interlacing area forming substance. In one embodiment, the<br>
macromoiecular indicator molecule is partially polymerized at the time of interaction<br>
with the interlacing areas.<br>
[0055]	in another embodiment, the macromoiecular indicator molecule is fully<br>
polymerized at the time of interaction with the interlacing areas. The arrow between<br>
Figures 4A and 4B indicates the secure immobilization of the macromolecule 100 on<br>
the surface of the support as the support material 207 reverts substantially back to,its<br>
original tight configuration. In this process macromolecule 100 is trapped as shown in<br>
Figure 4B and thus securely immobilized on to the surface of the support material. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, this process is accomplished by actively removing the<br>
interlacing area creating substance.<br>
[0056]	In another embodiment of the present invention, the interlacing area<br>
creating substance vaporizes over time. In yet another embodiment, the support is<br>
dried in the presence of oxygen to slow down the polymerization reaction, which is<br>
inhibited by oxygen and thus facilitate diffusion of the macromoiecular indicator<br>
molecule through the interlacing areas.<br><br><br>
[0057]	In another aspect of the present invention, indicator molecules may be<br>
immobilized on a support via ionic bonding. Ionic bonding is based on the electrostatic<br>
attraction of ions.<br>
[0058]	Suitable indicator molecules having ionic charges have been described<br>
above. Those indicator molecules may be monomeric or polymeric. Referring to<br>
Figure 5A, a suitable macromoiecular indicator molecule 510 is illustrated which has<br>
charges 511 distributed over the entire indicator molecule. The molecule is positively<br>
charged due to a large number of positively charged moieti as 511, for example, amine<br>
moieties, which are distributed over the molecule. In contrast, the molecule 520<br>
illustrated in Figure 5B, contains only a terminal positive charge 522. However, as<br>
described above, any indicator molecule carrying positive or negative charges at a<br>
suitable pH range can be used in the context of the present invention. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, indicator molecules carrying strong positive or negative charges at pHs<br>
around neutral are preferred.<br>
[0059]	Suitable support materials for immobilizing the indicator molecules via<br>
ionic bonding in accordance with the present invention have been described above and<br>
include, for example, PMMA. However, any support material that is ionic at suitable pH<br>
ranges may be used. Such support materials usually are not, but may be, inherently<br>
ionic at such pH ranges. Generally, the support materials may be modified to be ionic.<br>
For example, a support material may be modified to carry charges that, at a certain pH<br>
range, are opposite of the charge(s) of the appropriate indicator molecule that are to<br>
be attached to it. In one embodiment, sulfonates, which have been co-polymerized<br><br><br>
with methyl methacrylate (MMA), are covalently attached to a non-ionic support by<br>
methods known from the ion exchange resin art. ionic groups other than sulfonates<br>
may also be used in the context of the present invention. For example, other suitable<br>
strong anionic groups such as, but not limited to, methyfsulfonate, sulfonic acid,<br>
suifoisobutyl and sulfoethy! can be used in the context of the present invention. Strong<br>
cafionic groups such as, but not limited to, quaternary ammonium, quaternary amine,<br>
trimethylammonium methyl and dimethylyethanolamine can also be used in the context<br>
of the present invention. In a preferred embodiment, the groups are ionic at pHs<br>
around neutral. While ionic groups can be covalently linked to the support, in a<br>
preferred embodiment described above, the ionic groups are provided by coating the<br>
support with a copolymer of sulfonate and methyl methacrylate (MMA) or, in certain<br>
embodiments, by a glass or glass-like coating. However, other polymers, such as<br>
acrylate copolymers, can be used in the context of the present invention.<br>
[0060]	A process for coating a support in accordance with one embodiment of<br>
the present invention is illustrated in Figures 6A to 6D. Figure 6A illustrates a bean<br>
shaped sensor 600 and a mold 611 having an inner surface 612 which may be<br>
dimensioned to closely match the shape of the sensor 600. As shown in Figure 6B,<br>
when the sensor 600 is inserted into the mold 611, a small gap 613 remains between<br>
the surface 606 of the sensor and the inner surface 612 of the mold. Figure 6C shows<br>
how a coating 614 containing ion-exchanger groups, such as a MMA-su!fonate<br>
copolymer, is added to the mold to fill this gap. The coating is then cured, for example,<br>
by heat, to create a coated sensor device 615, as illustrated in Figure 6D. Figure 6D<br>
' shows the sensing device 615 having a strongly anionic coating 614. As discussed<br><br><br>
above, the anionic groups of the coating can form ionic bonds with cationic groups,<br>
such as amine groups, of an indicator molecule. However, as the person skilled in the<br>
art will appreciate, the coating can be applied in a variety of ways including, but not<br>
limited to, dipping or spraying.'<br>
[0061]	Figures 7 A to 7C illustrate the formation of ionic bonds and the resulting<br>
immobilization of a positively charged macromolecular indicator molecule on the body<br>
of a sensor surface. In particular, Figure 7A shows the device 615, having a coating<br>
614 having anionic groups 616 equally distributed over its surface. Figure 7B depicts a<br>
macromolecular indicator molecule 510 having positive charges 511 equally distributed<br>
over the molecule. The attraction of the negative charges 616 on the sensor support<br>
on the one hand, and the positive charges 511 on the macromolecular indicator<br>
molecule 510 allow immobilization of the macromolecular indicator molecule on the<br>
surface of the support in a simple ion exchange reaction. Thus, the macromolecular<br>
indicator molecule can be immobilized on the support as shown in Figure 7C by<br>
bringing it into contact with the support in a solution having a pH value that supports a<br>
strongly anionic charge of the support and a strongly cationic charge of the.indicator<br>
molecule. Since the macromolecular indicator molecule has positive charges<br>
distributed over the body of the molecule, these positive charges can form bonds with<br>
multiple negative charges on the support 717.<br>
[0062]	Figures 8A to 8C show an immobilization process similar to that shown in<br>
Figures 7A to 7C. However, the macromolecular indicator molecule 520 carries only a<br>
terminal positive charge 522 as opposed to positive charges over the entire body of the<br><br><br>
molecule as the molecule shown in Figure 7B. Accordingly, when the macromolecular<br><br>
indicator molecules of Figure 8B are attached to the anionic substrate 615 via an ion<br>
exchange reaction, the indicator molecules are attached to the substrate terminally 818,<br>
via an ionic bond between the terminal positive charge in each indicator molecule and<br>
an individual negatively charged group on the support.<br>
EXAMPLE I<br>
[0063]	An example of a protocol for producing the graft in accordance with one<br>
embodiment of the present invention is described below:<br>
[0064]	Solution A comprising HEMA (95.8%), EGDMA (ethylene glycol<br>
dimethacrylate) .(0.2%) as a crosslinker and acrylic acid (4%) was provided. A<br>
fluorescent monomeric indicator molecule, e.g., bis-carboxyiate bis-boronate-<br>
anthracene, was added to Solution A at 14 mg/ml (up to about 28 mg/ml) to create<br>
"Solution 1." 300ul of Solution 1 was then added to 700ul of distilled, deiortized water<br>
to yield "Solution 2" (white gel). 33.6ul of a 10% solution (100 mg/ml) of VA-044<br>
(Wako Chemical Co., Japan) (free radical, water soluble initiator molecule) was added<br>
to "Solution 2" to create "Solution 3."<br>
[0065]	In the meanwhile, the immobilization substrate, in this instance a PMMA<br>
core, was exposed to' ozone for overall 30 minutes in a UVOCS (Model # T0606 ozone<br>
chamber) to create hydroxyl groups on its surface to aid in wetting. A thin coating of<br>
stopcock grease was applied on the interface of a two part DELRIN® mold. The two<br>
mold halves were joined and locked together with three hose clamps (9-22.2 mm) and<br>
the bottom hole of the mold was plugged with a rubber septa. The mold was loaded<br><br><br>
with 200µl of Solution 3. The internal dimensions of the sensor mold, in this case a<br>
0.203" ID mold, were chosen to ensure that the graft was approximately 100µm thick.<br>
The ozone treated PMMA core was inserted into the mold so that the short bullnose<br>
end of the sensor entered the mold first and the sensor optics faced the wall of the<br>
mold and was perpendicular to the mold seam while avoiding the formation of air voids.<br>
Then the mold was sealed.. Heating at approximately 50°C for approximately 1-24<br>
hours, preferably 3-16 hours, generated a white gel polymer graft. During the heating<br>
at 50°C over an extended period of times,- e.g. 3 hrs., the HEMA monomer had time to<br>
penetrate the PMMA and interweaving with the PMMA polymer to generate an IPN<br>
(interpenetrating polymer network) could proceed. The PMMA core was subsequently<br>
removed from the mold and placed in PBS (phosphate buffered saline) storage.<br>
EXAMPLE II<br>
[0066]	An example of a protocol for producing the graft in accordance with<br>
another embodiment of the present invention is described below:<br>
[0067]	500 mg of a monomeric indicator molecule, such as bis-carboxylate bis-<br>
boronate-anthracene, was added to a 5g solution comprising HEMA and acrylic acid<br>
(90:10; w/w) to create "Solution 1." However, the relative molar ratios of the monomers<br>
may be varied to achieve different overall hydrophilicity and control the presence of<br>
excimer regions. The relative concentrations of the monomeric indicator molecule and<br>
hydrophilic monomer may range, for example, from 750mg -250 mg indicator to 5 g of<br>
Solution A. AIBN (2,2' azo-bis-isobutyronitrile, 98%), a free radical initiator that<br>
catalyzes the polymerization of the macromolecular indicator molecule, was added at 1<br><br><br>
weight percent to "Solution 1" to create "Solution 2." "Solution 2" was combined with a<br>
solution comprising ethanol and 2-methoxyethanol (70:30, w/w) at a weight ratio of 1:10<br>
to create "Solution 3." The solution comprising ethanol and 2-methoxyethanol was<br>
added to allow the polymerization reaction to take place and ultimately attack the<br>
surface of the PMMA to create interlacing areas. Heating "Solution 3" at approximately<br>
56°C for approximately 24 hours.under nitrogen (to drive off oxygen, which inhibits the<br>
pre-polymerization reaction) activated the AIBN initiator causing the polymerization of<br>
monomers to create polymers. The resulting "Solution 4," generally contains polymers<br>
of differing length as well as un-reacted monomers. "Solution 4" was mixed with the<br>
crosslinker para-toluene sulfonic acid (0.333% w/w). The mix was allowed to stand for<br>
2 hours in the dark to yield "Solution 5." The PMMA core was dipped into "Solution 5"<br>
and was then allowed to stand in the dark exposed to air for 24 hours. The PMMA core<br>
was cured to drive off remaining solvent at 100-110oC for 3 hours. Excess reaction<br>
material, which had not become mechanically fixed to the surface, was washed off in a<br>
washing and finishing step.<br>
