3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following  specification particularly  describes  the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a massage  oil and its preparation for eliminating/reducing a number of aliment from the body once massaging is performed and makes feeling like rejuvenate. The substances/ingredients chosen as components for the formulation of massage oil are of natural origin only.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Everyone is well versed with the utility of massage therapy  which gives a number of beneficial effects to the body. The use of massage oil in massage therapy is of paramount importance. It is mainly available in the form of oil, cream, gel etc. for massaging in different parts of the body either following a specific practice or in rude form. It is the massage oil that plays the sole role in reducing/ eliminating the problems associated with the body parts. Different approach  have been made by different inventors to formulate a body massage oil that can be able to cover a number of problems to be resolved.<br>
JP 1275514 provides a  massage oil containing lard, peppermint and a natural solvent at specific ratios, free from adverse effect on the skin and effective in promoting blood flow, improving the metabolism of the skin and activating the skin. It contains (A) 65-75wt.% of lard containing preferably &gt;=70% of oleic acid, (B) 10-15wt.% of peppermint and (C) the residual part of a natural solvent (e.g. animal milk such as cow's milk). The oil is also effective in ameliorating arthritis, etc., by applying to the joint.<br>
JP 2002145803 provide a breast massage oil which gives a good sense of use, has a high visual texture, and is safe, when orally taken by a baby on lactation after massage. This gel-like massage oil having a composition comprising 65 to 90 wt.% of an edible oil or an oil capable of being added to foods, 1 to 10 wt.% of an edible solubilizing agent, 1 to 30 wt.% of a polyhydric alcohol, and the remainder of water.<br>
CN 1166964 discloses a massage oil for skin consists of water solution of sodium chloride and glycerine and is used for painting and massaging of human body skin.<br>
The need of the hour is to find out a massage oil which is economically viable, easy to use, giving no side effects and should be from substances of natural origin covering a number of aliments in the body parts to be eliminated. An approach in this context has been worked out and a massage oil is formulated containing mustard oil, menthol crystals, bishop weed extract and camphor. These are naturally occurring ingredients and do not impart any side effect to the body parts. Again this formulation works wonder in heeling the problems.<br>
2<br><br>
OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The objective of the invention deals with means for body massage (i.e. massage oil) and could be applied for treating a number of body aliment.<br>
One more objective of the present invention is formulation of a massage oil containing mustard oil, menthol crystal, Bishop weed extract and camphor whose origin is from nature only.<br>
Still another objective of the invention is to prepare a massage oil containing the above ingredients in an innovative method.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention formulates a massage oil taking mustard oil, menthol crystal, Bishop weed extract and camphor in definite proportion by weight. A method is devised for preparation of the massage oil by which more benefit of the formulation is obtained also. In order to see the effectiveness of the formulation varying the weight percentage a test has been conducted and formulation giving most effect is determined.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Mustard oil is an amber-colored, volatile liquid derived from the seeds of the mustard plant. It is used as a flavoring agent in foods, soaps, as a rubefacient or counterirritant in folk medicine, fungicide, repellent for cats and dogs, in ointments and as a fumigant. It is also commonly used for cooking as well as for body and hair massage in certain parts of India. Mustard has been heralded as a curative. It stimulates appetite and digestion. It clears the sinuses in much the same way as chillies. Mustard increases blood circulation; hence it is used as a plaster on inflamed areas of the body. Mustard contains no cholesterol, only traces of fat and some protein. Depending on the variety of plant leaf, mustard contains calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and vitamin B. These foregoing properties of mustard oil makes it a choice as an a major component in the proposed massage oil. The samples available in the market is utilized in the present formulation without further treatment.<br>
Menthol is a compound obtained from peppermint oil or other mint oils or made synthetically. It is a Colourless Crystals resembling that of Peppermint like. It is soluble in Alcohol Chloroform, Solvent Ether, Liquid Paraffin and in Essential Oils. Menthol has local anesthetic and counterirritant qualities. It is contained in nonprescription products for short-term relief of minor sore throat and minor mouth or throat irritation. Menthol is also contained in combination products used for relief of muscle aches,<br>
3<br><br>
sprains, and similar conditions. It finds extensive application in Pharmaceuticals, Confectionery, Perfumery, Mouth Freshners, Cough Drops, Tobacco Goods, Medicated Oils, Toothpaste, Analgesic Balms, Lotions, Shampoo, Chewing Gum, Candies. The endless use and excellent properties offered by menthol attracts the attention of using it as an ingredient in massage oil. The samples to be used in the formulation (i.e. menthol crystal) is obtainable form the market.<br>
Bishop's weed (Trachyspermum amoni) is a small, erect, annual shrub, with soft fine hairs. It has many branched leafy stems; feather-like leaves 2.5 cm long; and 4 to 12 ray flower heads, each bearing 6 to 16 flowers. The fruits are minute, egg-shaped and greyish. The trade name ajwain is based on the Indian name which is derived from adarjawan. Ajwain or Bishop's weed has been used as a carminative medicine from the time of Charaka and Sushruta. Even Greek physicians like Dioscrides and Gelen used it in various carminative medicines. Some very valuable Unani medicines are prepared from aiwain seeds.<br>
An analysis of the aiwain seeds shows them to consist of moisture 7.4 per cent, protein 17.1 per cent, fat 21.8 per cent, minerals 7.9 per cent, fibre 21.2 per cent and carbohydrates 24.6 per cent per 100 grams. Calcium, phosphorus, iron, Carotene, thiamine, riboflavin and niacin are amongst the vitamins and minerals in it.<br>
Bishop's weed is an effective common cold remedy. It has a remarkable power to open up clogged and congested nasal passages. The seeds are useful in the treatment of migraine and delerium. The oil extracted from the seeds is beneficial in the treatment of rheumatic and neuralgic pains. It should be applied on the affected parts. The seed are stimulant and are useful in counteracting spasmodic disorders. The oil of ajwain is an almost colourless to brownish liquid with characteristic odour and a sharp hot taste. Steam distillation of crushed seeds yields an essential oil  which is valued considerably in medicine on account of the presence of thymol. For the present invention the steam distilled product of the crushed seeds of bishop weed (i.e. bishop weeds extract) is taken as an ingredient for the formulation of massage oil.<br>
Camphor is approved by the German Commission E for external use in the treatment of muscular rheumatism, inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract and cardiac symptoms. Internally, it is approved for circulatory regulation disorders caused by defective muscle tone or tension, and for inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract. Camphor has been used to increase blood flow to the skin, and has mild anesthetic and anti-itching properties.<br>
Topically, camphor is used to relieve pain, specifically on cold sores, hemorrhoids, warts, as an eardrop, and for minor burns. Camphor is found in over-the-counter backache medications and<br>
products that treat skin conditions such as acne and oily skin. It is also a component in products used<br>
4<br><br>
to treat bronchitis, chills, colds, coughs, and fever. Camphor is used as a moth and mosquito repellent and as a preservative in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. White (lightest and first fraction obtained by steam distillation) and brown (second fraction obtained, heavier than white) camphor are used to isolate perfumery chemicals such as safrol and cineol. White camphor, while environmentally hazardous, is used as a solvent in the paint and lacquer industry, and as a fragrance in detergents, disinfectants, soaps, and other household products. These valued qualities of camphor ensured an ingredient in the formulation of massage oil.<br>
The massage oil for massage containing mustard oil, menthol crystal, Bishop weed extract and camphor is prepared taking certain quantitative ratio for the ingredients. The massage oil is of pronounced anesthetic, warming effect, increases circulation, decreases intumescence and degenerative alterations in tissues and articulations by improving their mobility. Further its massage heels rheumatic pain, joint stiffness, backache and bruises and good for reducing carpal tunnel pain, colds, coughs, flu and other such illness. The body massaging by this oil can be performed in an esthetic salon, fitness club, parlour, various kinds of gyms aiming at cosmetic, health, rehabilitation, etc., and at home as well.<br>
The massage oil comprising the ingredients mustard oil, menthol crystals, bishops weed extract and camphor is prepared taking certain quantitative ratio of the ingredients and the process adopted is as follows.<br>
Mustard oil is heated to boiling and left to cooking until it is lukewarm. The lukewarm oil is added to a jar containing predetermined quantity of Menthol Crystal and Caraway Crystals and the mouth is sealed. Finally required amount of camphor is added to the above jar containing the ingredients. The ingredients in the jar are dissolved after 48 hours and the formulation (massage oil) is ready for use.<br>
Followings are the examples highlighting the formulation of proposed massage oil charging/ varying the percentage of ingredients. It is an assessment to find out the best formulation in terms of the results and the percentage of ingredients used. However, the scope of the invention is not limited to the formulation established in examples only.<br>
