This invention relates to a hydraulic system for loading and unloading a kiln car onto and from a furnace,<br>
This hydraulic system is especially useful for transferring a kiln car loaded with refractory moulded bricks from a moulding bay to a furnace,<br>
Magnesite bricks are required to be loaded into the kiln car after moulding in the moulding bay and then transferred to a furnace for baking. A transfer car transfers the kiln car near to the tendering furnace. The bricks are then transferred to the tempering furnace for baking the bricks before use. Loading of the kiln car onto the transfer car and from the transfer car to the furnace and back is done manually in the known prior art.<br>
In this known art, loading of the kiln car on the transfer car and unloading from the transfer car to the furnace and back takes lot of time and manpower. As a result, production output is decreased.<br>
The object of this invention is to provide a hydraulic system using hydraulic power so that loading and unloading is automatic. The loading of the kiln car on the transfer car and unloading can be accomplished by a single cylinder system or a dual cylinder system according to this invention. Loading of the kiln car onto the transfer car and from the transfer car to the tempering furnace is preferably carried out by a dual cylinder system. By this system, the time taken for loading and unloading is saved; production output is increased; and manpower required is considerably reduced.<br><br>
The present invention provides a hydraulic system for loading a kiln car onto a transfer car and unloading the kiln car from the transfer car, said system comprising :<br>

In one preferred embodiment, the cylinder system comprises two hydraulic cylinders mounted on said transfer car, with their cylinder rods being extendable in opposite directions, said power pack being connected to said cylinders by hydraulic lines.'<br>
A latch housing may be provided at the end of the cylinder rod of said or each cylinder; two latches being mounted side by side in said latch housing, and a solenoid valve being connected to said latches for actuating said latches to engage with or disengage from one of a plurality of latches provided on said kiln car.<br><br>
The power pack preferably comprises a hydraulic fluid tank, a gear pump connected to said tank for drawing hydraulic fluid from the tank, said gear pump being drivably connected to a motor, said hydraulic line connecting said gear pump to said at least one cylinder for actuating the cylinder rod of said cylinder.<br>
The tank may be divided into two parts by a baffle plate to prevent mixing of hydraulic fluid from suction side of the hydraulic circuit with the hydraulic fluid from the return side of the hydraulic circuit.<br>
In one embodiment of this invention, the hydraulic line is connected to said atleast one cylinder through direction control valves, relief valves, check valves and flow control valves mounted on manifolds for controlling flow of hydraulic fluid between the tank and said at least one cylinder.<br>
Each stopper assembly comprises a stopper cylinder mounted on the transfer car and connected to said power pack, a stopper connected to said stopper cylinder, said stopper being engageable with one of a plurality of stopper holders provided on the rail bed on which the transfer car is movably mounted when said stopper cylinder is operated.<br>
The transfer car is mounted on wheels movable on rails from one position to another. The stopper assemblies can be actuated by the hydraulic cylinder to engage in the holder to prevent movement of the transfer car as and when desired.<br><br>
The power pack is connected to the dual cylinder system or the single cylinder system and is controlled by switches on the control panel.<br>
The invention will now be described in detail with reference to preferred embodiments shown in the accompanying drawings, wherein -Fig.l.   shows in plan view one embodiment of the invention<br>

present invention comprising a transfer car with a<br>
single cylinder system; Figs. 6 &amp; 7 show two side views of the cylinder system of<br>
Fig.5; Figs. 8 to 8E show the pulling operation in stages; Figs. 9 to 9C show the pushing operation in stages;<br><br>
Figs. 10 to 34 show the operation of the system of the<br>
present invention in sequence.<br>
Figs. 1 to 4A show the details of a transfer car and a kiln car provided with a dual cylinder system. This system is used for loading the kiln car onto the transfer car and unloading it from the transfer car. In Fig.l, it can be seen that kiln car 2 is in resting position on transfer car 1.<br>
Transfer car 1 is mounted on wheels 10 movable on rails R fixed on a rail bed B (Fig. 2) . The rails R extend from a kiln car loading point to an unloading point (not shown) . The transfer car is provided with stopper assemblies (11, 12) for preventing it from moving from its position when the kiln car is being loaded onto the transfer car or when the kiln car is being unloaded from the transfer car. Each stopper assembly comprises a hydraulic stopper cylinder SC (Fig. 4) mounted on the transfer car and connected to a power pack 6 by hydraulic lines 28, 29 (Fig. 1) . This stopper cylinder SC (Fig. 4) is connected to a stopper S. Stopper holders SH are provided on the rail bed B supporting the rails R. When a stopper S is in alignment with a stopper holder SH, the stopper cylinder SC can be actuated so that the stopper S is engaged in the stopper holder SH or released therefrom. The stopper assembly is shown in Fig.4.<br>
The dual cylinder system comprises of two hydraulic cylinders 3 and 4 mounted on transfer car 1 between two rails Rl and R2 as can be seen from Fig.l. The cylinder rods of the two cylinders are extendable in opposite directions.<br><br>
Power pack 5 is connected to the cylinders 3 and 4 by hydraulic lines 6 and 7. The power pack 5 is connected to an electric control panel 8 by wiring 9. Stopper assemblies 11 and 12 are mounted on the transfer car and are operated by the power pack 5 through hydraulic lines 28 and 29 as already explained.<br>
Spring actuated arresters may be provided on the transfer car l and kiln car to prevent the transfer car from over-shooting due to inertia after the pulling/pushing operation is completed. Spring-loaded arresters are mounted on the rails Rl and R2 adjacent to limit switches provided on the rails. When the kiln car wheel comes in contact with a limit switch, it has to stop. But due to inertia, the wheel may override the switch. The spring-loaded arrester prevents such overriding. These arresters can be depressed to allow the kiln car to over-ride when the cylinder pushes or pulls the kiln car by force.<br>
Fig.46 shows the hydraulic circuit diagram of the power pack for the dual cylinder system of Fig.l. Figs 4C-4E show the different views of the power pack. This power pack comprises a hydraulic fluid tank 18 having a breather filter 19 and a level indicator 20. A suction strainer 18' in tank 18 is connected to a gear pump 21 driven by an electric motor M. The electric motor is connected to the gear pump by means of a gear coupling 22 which preferably comprises a bell housing and a gear coupling.<br><br>
From Pig. 4B it can be seen that gear pump 21 is connected to the cylinders 3 and 4 by hydraulic lines 6 and 7. Throttle valves are provided in the hydraulic lines for controlling flow of fluid between tank 18 and the cylinders 3 and 4. Gear pnvap 21 generates required flow of hydraulic fluid at required pressure. Direction control valves 24, 25, 25", 26, relief valves 27, check valves 27', 27", 27"'and flow control valves are mounted on manifolds 23. Pipe lines carry hydraulic fluid under pressure through hydraulic lines 6 and 7 and these valves and manifolds in accordance with a pre-set sec[uence. These pipe lines may be seamless tubes crimped to withstand high pressure generated in the system.<br>
Tank 18 stores hydraulic fluid such as oil, and is preferably rectangular in shape. It can be fabricated from MS sheets and angles. Outer side of the tank is manually welded by arc welding to prevent leakage of hydraulic fluid. Inner side of the tank is preferably pickled and coated with casting sealer to prevent rusting and corrosion. Outer side of the tank is coated with redoxide and paint. The tank can be bifurcated into two parts by a baffle plate made of MS sheet, to prevent mixing of hydraulic fluid from the return side of the hydraulic circuit with the hydraulic fluid from the suction side of the hydraulic circuit.<br>
Electric control panel 8 (Fig.l) is provided with electrical elements such as relays, switch gears, fuses, power contactors and auxiliary contactors enclosed in an MS cabinet.  The circuit for the power pack comprises two motors<br><br>
Ml and M2 connected in parallel to an AC supply, as shown in Fig. 4F, through fuses F1-F3 and F4-F6 respectively. The motors are connected to push buttons PBO and PBl. When the push button PBO is pressed, motor M2 starts. After that, the sequence of solenoid starts, to push and pull the kiln car inside and outside by means of the cylinders 3 and 4. For stopping the sec[uence, push button PBl can be pressed. The actuation solenoid sequence is by PCB.<br>

The transfer car 1 and kiln car 2 are provided with a latch system. This system comprises a plurality of latches (13, 14, 13') provided at spaced apart locations on the underside of the kiln car 1 as can be seen from Figs. 3 and 10. From Fig. 3, it can be seen that a latch housing 31 is connected at the free end of the cylinder rod 30 of each cylinder 3 and 4. Two latches L are housed in the latch housing and are spaced apart from each other. A solenoid valve (16, 17) is connected to the latches L of each latch housing as can be seen from Fig. 10. When a latch, for e.g., a latch 13 on the kiln car comes in alignment with the latches L at the cylinder rod end of one cylinder (see Fig. 11), on energisation of the solenoid valve 16, the latches L in the latch housing engage the latch 13 so that when the cylinder rod is moved by hydraulic pressure, the kiln car is pushed/pulled along with the cylinder rod. On deactivating the solenoid valve 16, the latch 13 can be detached from the latches in the latch housing.<br>
Cylinders 3 and 4 will not operate when the stoppers S are not in position to anchor the transfer car 1. Arresters stop the over-riding of the kiln car 2 when the cylinder 3 or 4 completes the pushing/pulling operation. Cylinder strokes can be adjusted by limit switches. Electrical wiring for the solenoid valves 16, 17 can be carried on small cable conveyors, so that the wiring does not obstruct the movement of the cylinder rods. The control circuit is preferably operated at 24 V DC.<br><br>
The power pack is suitable to operate the hydraulic<br>
cylinders 3 and 4 at the following speeds:<br>
(a)	Pulling and pushing speed: 40 to 80 mm/sec,<br>
(b)	Total time taken to complete the strokes of<br>
each cylinder	: about 3 minutes<br>
(c)	Maximum operating<br>
pressure	: 140 Kg/sq.cm.<br>
(d)	Electric motor power    : 5 HP at 1450 rpm,<br>
3 PH, 415 V.<br>
Figs. 5 to 7 show a single cylinder system. This system can also be used for loading a kiln car onto a transfer car l and unloading the kiln car from the transfer car, and is an alternative embodiment to that described with reference to Figs. 1 to 4A.<br>
The single cylinder system comprises a hydraulic cylinder 3 provided on the transfer car between rails Rl and R2. Cylinder 3 is connected to power pack 5 by the hydraulic line 6. Stopper assemblies 11 and 12 are provided for preventing movement of the transfer car when the kiln car is being loaded on to or is being unloaded from the transfer car. An electric control panel 8 is connected to the power pack 5 by wiring 9. These stopper assemblies and their operation are same as in the case of the embodiment described with reference to Fig. 4 in respect of the embodiment using a dual cylinder system.<br>
Latching system is provided on the kiln car and cylinder rod of the cylinder 3 as explained with reference to Fig. 3.<br><br>
The difference between the system of Fig.l and the system of Fig.5 lies in that only i one cylinder 3 is provided in the case of the single cylinder; system of Fig. 5, whereas in the case of the dual cylinder system of Fig. 1, two cylinders 3, 4 are provided. So,; the other details of the single cylinder system are same as in the case of the double cylinder system described with reference to Figs.l to 4E and are therefore not described again.<br>
The kiln car 2 in loaded condition is pulled onto the rails Rl and R2 provided on the transfer car l by actuating cylinders 3 and 4 in three or four strokes with the help of the power pack 5 by operating switches on the control panel 8. Distance travelled by the kiln car during this operation is usually around 2 metres. The transfer car, with the kiln car resting thereon is moved on the rails R to the furnace. Depending on the need, the kiln car can be pushed into the furnace which is directly in line with a moulding bay where the kiln car is loaded onto the transfer car, or the kiln car can be transferred by the transfer car to another furnace.<br>
Figs. 8-8E show the pulling operation of the hydraulic cylinder to pull the kiln car onto the transfer car in three strokes. Fig. 8 shows the kiln car resting outside the transfer car. The three latches 13, 14, 13' on the kiln car and latches L on the two hydraulic cylinders can also be seen in this Figure. During the first pulling stroke, the latches on the cylinder rod of one hydraulic cylinder engages with<br><br>
latch 13 on the kiln car (Fig. 8A). When the first stroke is completed, the kiln car 2 is pulled towards transfer car 1 (Fig. 8B) . The latches on the cylinder rod are disengaged by the corresponding solenoid valve 16 or 17 (not shown) and during the stroke, the latches L engage with the second latch 14 on the kiln car as can be seen from Figs. 8C and 8D. During the third stroke, the kiln car with its latch 13' engaged in the latches L on the cylinder rod is moved onto the transfer car (Fig. 8E) .<br>
Figs. 9-9C show the pushing operation. In Fig. 9, the kiln car is resting on the transfer car with its latch 13 engaged in the latch L on the cylinder rod of the other hydraulic cylinder. During the first stroke, the hydraulic cylinder starts pushing the kiln car towards the furnace. Fig. 9A shows the position of the kiln car on completion of the first stroke. From Fig. 9B, it can be seen that the latches on the cylinder rod engage the latch 14 on the kiln car at the end of second stroke of the hydraulic cylinder and the cylinder rod pushes the kiln car out of the transfer car. From Fig. 9C it can be seen that on completion of the third stroke with the latches on the cylinder rod engaging the third latch 13' on the kiln car, the kiln car is completely pushed out of the transfer car into the furnace. The latches on the cylinder rod are then disengaged from the latch 13' on the kiln car.<br>
The detailed operation of the dual cylinder system will now be described with reference to Figs. 10-34.<br><br>
The transfer car and the kiln car loaded at the moulding bay are aligned with each other.<br>
Fig. 10 shows the cylinders 3 and 4 on the transfer car 1 and the kiln car 2 outside the transfer car. When hydraulic fluid is supplied to cylinder 3, the cylinder rod moves forward and the latches in the latch housing mounted on the cylinder rod come in line with latch 13 of kiln car 2 (Fig. 11) . On actuation of solenoid valve 16, the latches engage with latch 13 (Fig. 12).<br>
As the cylinder rod of cylinder 3 retracts rearwardly, it pulls the kiln car 2 (Fig. 13) . Then solenoid valve 16 is activated to detach the latches in the latch housing from latch 13 (Fig. 14) . The cylinder rod of cylinder 3 then moves forward and the latches on the cylinder rod come in line with second latch 14 (Fig.15). The solenoid valve 16 is actuated to engage the latches with latch 14 (Fig. 16) .<br>
The cylinder rod then retracts rearwardly and pulls the kiln car towards the transfer car (Fig. 17) . Solenoid valve 16 is deactivated to disengage latch 14 (Fig. 18) . The latches come in line with the third latch 13' on the kiln car (Fig. 19) . Solenoid valve 16 is then actuated to engage the latches with latch 13' (Fig. 20).<br>
The cylinder rod will then retract rearvardly to pull the kiln car onto the transfer car (Fig. 21) . The kiln car will then rest on the transfer car, and the solenoid valve 16 is deactivated. In this position, latch 13 will be in line<br><br>
with latches connected  to  the other solenoid valve 17 (Fig. 22).<br>
When the kiln car is to be unloaded from the transfer car, solenoid valve 17 is activated to engage the latches on the cylinder rod of cylinder 4 with latch 13 on the kiln car (Fig.23). The cylinder rod of cylinder 4 then moves forward and pushes the kiln car (Fig.24) . The solenoid valve 17 then disengages latch 13 from the latches (Fig.25). The cylinder rod then retracts rearwardly so that latches controlled by solenoid valve 17 come in line with latch 14 (Fig.26) . Solenoid valve 17 is activated to engage latches on the cylinder rod with latch 14 (Fig.27).<br>
The cylinder 4 is operated to move its cylinder rod forward to push the kiln car from the transfer car (Fig. 28). Solenoid valve 17 is activated to disengage the latches from latch 14 (Fig. 29) . Cylinder rod is then retracted and the latches on the cylinder rod end come in line with latch 13' on the kiln car (Fig.30).<br>
Solenoid valve 17 is then activated so that the latches engage latch 13' (Fig. 31) . The cylinder rod is then moved forward to push the kiln car out of the transfer car (Fig.32). In this position, the kiln car is in the tempering furnace. Solenoid valve 17 is then deactivated to disengage the latches from latch 13* (Fig. 33) . The cylinder rod is then retracted (Fig. 34).<br>
The kiln car can be removed from the tempering furnace onto the transfer car and unloaded from the transfer car at<br><br>
the unloading point by carrying out the operation in the same manner as described above, but in the reverse order.<br>
The whole operation can be carried out by a remote control system.<br>
The operation of the single cylinder system of Figs 5 to 7 is similar to that of the dual cylinder system of Figs. 1 to 4A. But in the single cylinder system, the kiln car can be loaded and unloaded from the same side since there is only one cylinder.<br>
Although the invention is described with reference to preferred embodiments, it is not restricted to these embodiments. The invention includes all equivalents coming within the scope of the invention as claimed.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
