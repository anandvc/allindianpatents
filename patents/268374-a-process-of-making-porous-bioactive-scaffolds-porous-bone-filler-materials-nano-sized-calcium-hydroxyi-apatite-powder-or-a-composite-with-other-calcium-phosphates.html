				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process of making porous bioactive scaffolds and porous bone filler materials with nano sized calcium hydroxyapatite powder or a composite with other calcium phosphates. This invention particularly relates to a simple, cost-effective, energy efficient process for making nano-sized calcium hydroxy apatite powders by solution combustion synthesis technique.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The human bone and teeth are mineralized tissues. A typical wet cortical bone is composed of 22wt% organic matrix, 69wt% mineral, and 9wt% water. The major sub phase of the mineral consists of submicroscopic crystals of an apatite of calcium and phosphate, whose crystal structure is very similar to calcium hydroxyl apatite. These crystals are slender needles, 20-40 nm long and 1.5 -7 nm in diameter. The mineral phase is made of a continuous cellular structure which gives very good mechanical strength.<br>
Ceramics are historically the oldest of the synthetic materials and their medical application can be traced back to ancient Egyptian periods. In Egyptian sarcophagi, both filled and artificial teeth have been found in the mouths of the mummies. The repair and reconstruction of osseous defects have long been a serious challenge to the skills of orthopedic and maxillofacial surgeons In order to restore form and function to patients, repairing bone defects presently involves several surgical techniques. However, although effective in many cases, the existing technology has numerous difficulties and disadvantages. Therefore the implantation of materials of different types in the human or animal body in order to replace bone portions which have been traumatized or which have deteriorated due to diseases is steadily increasing. In order to eliminate the risk of having immunological or infectious diseases and to avoid operations on several sites, different synthetic materials have come into use within this technical field. As examples of suitable materials used for said purpose there can be mentioned minerals and ceramics such as tri-calcium phosphate and calcium aluminate. Especially preferred materials are, however, materials having a chemical composition and crystal structure similar to those of the materials that are built up by the living organism, such as calcium hydroxy-apatite. One synthetic material of this type which has come into use for restoring bone tissue is the mineral calcium hydroxy apatite having chemical formula Ca10 (PO4)6(OH)2<br>
and is available both as blocks of different shapes and granules of different sizes. Commercial hydroxyl apatite is supplied by many producers. Thus, for instance, hydroxy apatite of the above-mentioned composition is manufactured by Asahi Optical Co.. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan, Interpore Int. Irvine, Calif., USA, and Impladent Ltd., Holliswood, N.Y., USA. The material is available both as resorbable and as non-resorable hydroxy apatite granules/particles for different applications.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Reference may be made to United States Patent No.6231607 and W097/23428, by Ben Bassat wherein it is reported that a mixture of calcium ions, phosphate ions, aspartic acid and carbonate ions was exposed to microwave irradiation followed by quenching to room temperature, filtering with water and the resultant cake is pulverized, pressed and sintered to yield a mixture of calcium hydroxy apatite, α-and ß- tetra-calcium phosphates in different proportions which is useful as a bone graft substitute. The drawbacks of the process are the product is not pure calcium hydroxy apatite and the process is complex involving multiple steps.<br>
Reference may be made to patent no EP1110908 by Isobe Tetsuhiko et al wherein it was reported a method of synthesis of calcium hydroxy apatite by preparing a mixed material slurry by dispersing calcium hydroxide powder into a phosphoric acid solution; conducting a mechanochemical milling treatment in which shearing force and compressive force based on a centrifugal force of a mechanical rotating body are imparted to the mixed material slurry, and reacting the calcium hydrate component with the phosphoric acid component under normal temperature and pressure thereby to prepare calcium hydroxyl apatite powder having fine crystals with uniform particle size. The main drawbacks of the process are that the process is not very simple, time consuming and not very cost effective.<br>
Reference may be made to Korean Patent No. KR 9504767 by Lee Byong-Min et al in the reported synthesis of calcium hydroxy apatite using pre-saturated calcium hydroxide suspension solutions with aqueous phosphoric acid at a pH of 11.0. The drawbacks are that the process is not very simple, time consuming and not very cost effective.<br>
Reference may be made to French patent FR 2696439 by Jean-Claude Heughebaert discloses one method and apparatus for continuous production of calcium hydroxyl apatite powders from calcium salt solutions and aqueous phosphates at pH range of 6.0-7.0. The drawbacks are this process disclosed details of instrumentation only.<br>
Reference may be made to Canadian patent CN1391904 by Li Jinghong synthesis of calcium hydroxyl apatite in the size range of 5-800nm although the product contains 5 to 80% calcium hydroxy apatite and along with vitamins and other ingredients can be used for calcium supplementing agents. The drawbacks are that the product although ultra fine is not pure and crystalline and application is limited.<br>
Reference may be made to Canadian patent no CN1404880 by Sun Jiaju wherein a novel porous calcium carbonate-calcium hydroxy apatite gradient material is reported. In this product of different ratio surface layer is calcium hydroxyl apatite and the core is calcium carbonate. The drawbacks are that the product although ultra fine is not pure and crystalline and application is limited.<br>
Reference may be made to United States Patent No.7169372 by Rudin et al wherein a crystalline calcium hydroxy apatite synthesis involving multiple stages using multiple reactors is reported. The drawbacks are it involves too many stages and many reactors making the process difficult.<br>
Reference may be made to patent no. WO/2005/123579 by Kjellin et al. wherein a process of making nano sized calcium hydroxy apatite powder and very thin coating on titanium is described by using micro-emulsion technique. The drawbacks are it involves too many stages and time consuming making the process uneconomical.<br>
Reference may be made to patent no WO/2008/007992 by Lopes et. al wherein, a process of continuous synthesis of nano and micro sized calcium hydroxy apatite powder is described. The drawbacks are it involves too many controlling parameters and the primary product requires further processing through many stages making the process difficult.<br>
However, no prior art is reported on synthesis of pure nanosized calcium hydroxy<br>
apatites by solution combustion technique.<br>
Drawbacks of the above prior arts may be summarized as:<br>
1    The products are not always pure.<br>
2.	The processes are complex involving multiple steps and multiple controlling parameters, time consuming and sometimes involves energy inefficient processing steps like sintering, pulverizing, milling etc.<br>
3.	In some cases products are not crystalline.<br>
The existing processes for synthesis of calcium hydroxyl apatite (Hap) are not simple and versatile. Known Hap powders are not always pure in composition and in some cases not crystalline. Moreover, in most of the cases, the particle size of the powders are not very fine, therefore, it can not be used to fabricate mechanically strong porous scaffolds and the range of applications are limited. A simple versatile process for synthesis of pure nano sized calcium hydroxyl apatite or a composite with other calcium phosphates is necessary.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention describes a technique of solution combustion synthesis of nano-sized calcium hydroxy apatite powders in which aqueous Ca-nitrate, (or dilute nitric acid solution of suitable calcium salts), di-ammonium hydrogen ortho-phosphate (or other phosphate sources) system containing a single or mixture of fuels, is employed in order to obtain a homogeneous, porous, easily dispersible, nano-crystalline powder of calcium hydroxy apatite by using a mixture of suitable proportion of reactant fuels in required ratio and suitably controlling the reaction temperature, reaction environment and other processing parameters. The novelty of this invention is that the resultant calcium hydroxy apatite powder is nano-crystalline and does not require any further heat treatment. Further by controlling one or two parameters it is possible to change the nature and quality of the end product with very good precision.<br>
Thus the non-obvious inventive step of the present invention lies in utilizing solution combustion synthesis technology for the preparation of the novel materials i.e., nano-sized calcium hydroxy apatite and its composite with ß-tri-calcium phosphate or other calcium phosphates<br>
Another significant non-obvious point in this invention is that a mixture of fuels (urea, glycine and glucose) may be used for synthesis of pure nano-crystalline calcium hydroxy apatite or a composite with ß-tri-calcium phosphate or tetra calcium phosphate with reduced particle size compared with conventional combustion synthesized product.<br>
Another significant point in this invention is that laboratory grade reagents or chemicals may be used for synthesis of pure nano-crystalline calcium hydroxy apatite or a composite with tetra calcium phosphate.<br>
Another significant non-obvious point in this invention is that reaction atmosphere may be controlled for synthesis of controlled composition of the end product.<br>
Although the concentration of the reactant solutions does not affect the reaction kinetics of the combustion synthesis reaction very dilute solutions take longer time to evaporate out the solvent thus making the process time consuming and less energy efficient. The reaction temperature (temperature of the pre-heated furnace) influences the total reaction time but not the product crystal phases. However, increasing reaction temperature increases agglomeration of the resultant product powder.<br>
1.	The reactants calcium nitrate tetra-hydrate or dilute nitric acid solution of calcium carbonate, calcium oxide or any suitable calcium salt and di-ammonium hydrogen phosphate, or ammonium di-hydrogen phosphate, or phosphoric acid was dissolved in de-carbonated distilled water to make 0.5 to 2.75 molar and 0.5 to 5.5 molar aqueous solutions respectively.<br>
2.	The above said aqueous solutions are mixed in a Pyrex beaker of large size or in a glass lined vessel in predetermined appropriate volumes to maintain Ca:P molar ratio from 1.45 to 1.76 when a white precipitate formed.<br>
3.	Concentrated nitric acid is added drop-wise to the mixture with stirring till the pH changes close to 3.5 and the solution became transparent.<br>
4.	Solid fuel (urea, glycine in pure form or in a mixture of both) is added to the solution in 1 to 7 molar times with respect to the calcium nitrate concentration.<br>
5.	An additional fuel of sugar (glucose, dextrose or sucrose) is added to the solution in 0 to 1 molar times with respect to the calcium nitrate concentration.<br>
6.	The solution is homogenized by stirring.<br>
7.	The solution is placed in a controlled atmosphere in a furnace pre-heated to 500 to 700°C±5°C.<br>
8.	The solution boiled underwent dehydration, decomposed with evolution of large volume of gases.<br>
9.	The resultant mass then frothed and swelled to yield foam, a flame appeared and produced incandescence for about a minute.<br>
10.	The resultant soft voluminous fluffy foam like mass grounded manually to the desired product.<br>
11.	The nanosized calcium hydroxyapatite or its composite (with other calcium phosphate) powder of this invention can advantageously be used to form free flowing porous granules to be used as a bone graft material and can be used to treat damage to tissues in the dental cavity.<br>
12. The finely ground hydroxyapatite powder or its composite (with other calcium phosphate) is mixed with a pore former like naphthalene (0 to 60% by weight) and pressed uniaxially to form pellets. The pellets are heat treated slowly at a suitable heat treatment schedule at ambient pressure and atmosphere or vacuum for a prolonged time to ensure complete drying. The resultant pellets are sintered at a suitable temperature (700 to 750°C) in an ambient atmosphere to result a porous scaffold. The porous scaffold on further controlled grinding results porous granules for application as bone filler.<br>
The present invention has main usages in medical science. In advanced surgical techniques particularly in the preparation of artificial bone or bone graft substitutes and in the area of biopharmaceutics, calcium hydroxy apatite is used for the development of effective implantable vehicles for drug delivery applications. It is also used as a coating either in pure form or in combination with other materials like bioactive glass or other calcium phosphates on metallic orthopaedic implants. Some calcium phosphates are considered biomaterials, used as: food additives and nutritional supplements; bone graft materials for bone replacement, growth and repair; biocements and coating of metallic implants. Some of the most recent applications include their use in cosmetics, toothpaste and in esthetical treatments for diminishing wrinkles by stimulating conjunctive tissue formation. The non-medical applications include packing media for column chromatography, gas sensors, various catalysts and host material for lasers.<br>
All percentages are expressed in weight percent unless otherwise specified. When the composition in this invention described herein states "about" it is contemplated that the values given are valid +/- 0.1 wt%.<br>

EXAMPLE-5<br>
11.81 gms of Ca(NO3)2.4H2O, dissolved in 100 ml of decarbonated distilled water to make 0.5 molar aqueous solution, 72.6 gms of di-ammonium hydrogen phosphate dissolved in 100 ml of decarbonated distilled water to make 5.5 molar aqueous solution. 74.5 ml of Ca(NO3)2-4H2O solution and 3.86 ml of di-ammonium hydrogen phosphate solution were mixed in a 250 ml pyrex beaker to obtain a Ca:P molar ratio of 1.76. Immediately a white precipitate formed. The resulting white precipitate was dissolved by adding 3.0 ml of concentrated nitric acid dropwise with stirring. 11.18 gms of solid urea (0.19 mole) and 0.43 gms of glucose or dextrose (0.0024 mole) was added to it and the mixture was homogenized by stirring for 30 minutes at room temperature. The beaker was heated in ambient atmosphere in a furnace preheated at 700°C. The solution soon started to boil, underwent dehydration and decomposition and a large volume of gases evolved. The resulting mass then frothed and swelled to yield a foam, which smolder for a couple of minutes without any flame. The resulting product is voluminous, fluffy foam like mass. The resultant powder is mixed thoroughly with ß-napthalene powder (≤296 µm) in a ratio of about 53:47 wt% in geometrical fashion under controlled environment, cold iso-statically pressed, dried carefully in a controlled manner and finally sintered at 720°C for 0.5 minutes and further milled and sieved to yield a desired particle size (1.0 mm to 1.5 mm) powder for subsequent use as bone filler material. The XRD analysis showed the product as composite of crystalline calcium hydroxy apatite and other phosphates. FTIR spectrum corroborates the XRD data.

The XRD analysis showed the product as composite of crystalline calcium hydroxy apatite and other phosphates. FTIR spectrum corroborates the XRD data. Particle size analysis and SEM micrograph results indicate the product is nano-sized agglomerated powder composed of isometric spherical particles. The products of all the examples cited above were characterized by X-ray to study the phase formation (Philips Analytical, X'Pert, 1830, Holland), I. R. spectroscopy in the range of 4000 Cm-1 to 400 Cm-1 by Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer, Model 1615) in the transmission mode. The median diameter of the resultant powder particles and the particle size distribution were ascertained by photon correlation spectroscopy (Mastersizer 2000, Malvern, UK).The particle morphology, agglomerate structure and the microstructure were investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Leo430i). The powders are all nano-crystalline and the size varies from 60 to 150 nm. The FTIR spectra of the samples showed characteristic PO4 bands at 1046, 954, 600 and 569 cm-1 and OH stretching mode at 3431 cm-1. The XRD patterns of the samples showed presence of desired calcium hydroxy apatite phase. However, depending upon the starting Ca.P molar ratio the product powder may contain other crystalline phases like ß-Ca3(PO4)2 (ß-TCP) and other tri-calcium phosphates in different proportions depending upon starting raw materials and starting molar ratio.<br>
The SEM micrographs taken showed that the particles are agglomerated and highly porous and composed of fine isometric particles having narrow size distribution.<br>
