It avoids harmonics, magnetic retention and increases permeability. The CRGO core are mixed with amorphous core in ratios depending on voltage and capacity of transformer for uniform phase angles of output voltages. Then midget transfonners (Mtrs) of non-conventional terminal combinations in seven models are made with this amalgamated core. Many Mtrs substitute a massive Tr. So the number of primary turns of Mtr is reduced in relation to the proposed number of Mtrs in a group but their cross section of primary conductor is kept same so as to carry same current equal to that of massive Tr. The midget secondary conductor is reduced to smaller cross section but its turns increased in proportion and supplies a fraction of load determined by their numbers. To control power, star node circuit breakers (Sncbs) in three types are used. Ten modes of Inter Network connections of these Mtrs &amp; Sncbs form the new substations.</td>

				<td>The Invention of 'MIDGET TRANSFORMERS' with multi sets of supply terminals like models '363% '369% '433% '466% '436' '463', '36t3' with built in 'STAR NODE CIRCUIT BREAKERS' of types 'SI%'VI%'AI' and their ' INTER NETWORKED' connections in modes 'Delta Primary 'and 'Star Primary'<br>
Introduction<br>
In the Distribution site substations, the transformer faithfully transforms the 'high voltage-low current' power into a 'low voltage-high current' power in step down function and in vice versa pattern in the Generation site substations where the voltage is stepped up. These 'high voltage' and the 'high current' magnitudes dealt with by the 'high capacity' equipments have been actually causing great expense in materials and great loss in energy drain apart from exposing the humanity to great risks during accidents. According to this invention 50% more materials have been consumed in the construction of substations, which waste 4% additional energy continuously. Further these substations are exposed to fire hazards that have taken the toll in men and materials in the past several occasions.<br>
Hence all the 'high' parameters are converted to 'low' ones without compromising on function but at the same time adding efficiency.<br>
The high input voltage nowadays applied to a 'main' transformer is here apportioned and fed to many small 'midget' transformers, those of which are widely placed apart to get well ventilation. Hence the severity of voltage problem is thereby diluted. In a conductor, the current flow confines to the outer circumference only due to 'skin effect' and conduction ratio is far lesser. If many small conductors are put in parallel in the place of one and current carried instead, then the conduction ratio improves, saving in area of conductor. If many small 'midget' transformers happen to supply the load instead of one big 'main'<br><br>
transformer, then the 'skin effect' benefit is fully availed in this scheme of works as never before enjoyed. New switch- gear in small ratings like the 'star node circuit breakers' are invented and they substitute the giant, costly conventional switchgear in control applications. The eddy current loss is disproportionately lesser in smaller cores and the mutual inductance is also disproportionately more in them with more permeability. All of these factors are the clear advantages that are exploited in this invention. Some 'Inter Network' circuit concepts are newly created. These concepts are explained partly through single-phase transformer connections and they are applicable to three phase transformers also in any voltage ratio and in any capacity of power and in any type of insulation, be it oil or cast resin.<br>
Fig (1) refers to a conventional 'main' transformer with one primary and one secondary as found in present day SS. This transformer, if in giant size, when employed for 'big loads', gives the real problems as explained earlier.<br>
Fig (2) refers to splitting the 'main' into two 'mini' transformers after subdivision of both windings in order to cater to the 'big load' by the two 'minis'. The parallel splitting of the windings is called 'subdivision' as the number of turns in both cases remains unaltered. But this arrangement of many 'minis' requires extra switchgears at the primary side to control each 'mini' transformer and so not recommended nor adopted in practice. This disadvantage is overcome in case of many 'midget' transformers substituting a 'main' transformer.<br>
Fig (3) refers to splitting the 'main' into two 'midget' transformers equaling in three phase version to 'midget' of model '363'. It arises after segmentation of the primary and subdivision of the secondary. The splitting of winding in serial fashion is called 'segmentation' as the number of turns is halved in the second case. In this 'Inter Network' the secondary of both the 'midgets' should be in conjoined state without option.<br>
Fig (4) refers to splitting into several three-phase 'midget' transformers of model  '363'  with conjoined secondary.  It is<br><br>
analogous to Fig (3) that is in single-phase. This three phase 'Inter<br>
Network' is actually suitable for evacuation of 'big power' at the<br>
generation site by means of many midgets and again for catering of<br>
similar 'big load' at distribution site by means of another set of<br>
midgets '363' in similar 'Inter Network'. In'363'there is two<br>
power input and one output version used for purpose of UPS.<br>
Fig (5) refers to splitting of the 'main' into two 'midget' trs with<br>
their many output secondary being separate unlike as in previous<br>
Fig (3). It was made possible by adding an additional winding<br>
called 'equalizer winding' to each of the midget transformer and<br>
the equalizers are kept conjoined instead of the secondary. This<br>
conjoining puts all the midgets in equal sharing mode.<br>
Fig (6) refers to splitting the 'main' into several three-phase<br>
'midget' transformers of model '369' with their individual separate<br>
secondary. This type 'Inter Network' is suitable for transmission<br>
and distribution systems for stepping down functions.<br>
Fig (7) refers to three-dimensional representation of the Fig (3).<br>
Fig (8) refers to external methods of connecting the primary in<br>
'DP' mode and the secondary of the midget transformers are put in<br>
parallel. Delta or Star configuration at the primary side referred as<br>
'DP' or 'SP' mode is possible as per the design whatsoever.   It<br>
could be done externally only and not internally as is the case with<br>
the conventional transformers.<br>
Fig (9) refers to 'midgets' of model '363' in an installation to show<br>
how a stand-by captive generator can be later on connected<br>
economically without additional cables.<br>
Fig (10) refers to 'midgets' of model '436'in (a) and of models<br>
'463' and '436' in combination in (b) in indoor applications for LT<br>
distribution in a high-rise building. Inter Networks involving<br>
models '466' or '469' or both in one can be rigged up.<br>
The first digit represents the number EI core legs. The '3' for 3<br>
legged core and '4' represents special 4-legged core.<br>

DETAILED DISCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The transformer in any S.S is the most powerful and predominant equipment but contrary to its status it is absolutely silent without any rattle or any inside motion or any outside movement. It causes least set of problems to the maintenance crew. However when its size is too large with auxiliary equipments, one for forced oil circulation, another for air blowing and so on, its convenience vanishes and its complexity increases. Its huge size occupies a large space in the outdoor yard and its explosive nature expels it far away from the interior control rooms and creates many difficulties for repair crew. Further its transport to the site and installing there is yet another tedious task that warrants a giant crane, which is nevertheless cumbersome to handle especially in some of those, crooked places. Therefore a system has been invented wherein this large transformer is split into several little midgets. This naturally results in savings of the expensive bus-bar chamber that gets totally eliminated without incurring any compromise or complexity in functions.<br>
If full voltage instead of applying to one 'main' is alternately apportioned to the primaries of many midgets without affecting their current carrying capacities, it is called 'segmentation'. If the output current that is flowing to the load is shared by many secondary without reducing their voltage, it is called 'subdivision'. These processes tame the severities of voltage and current and bring them down to safe and lower levels. For such purpose Midget transformers are invented and there are seven models of them to suit to different field applications. They are notified in abbreviations as 1) Mtrs '363'. 2) Mtrs '369'. 3) Mtrs '433'. 4) Mtrs '466'. 5) Mtrs '436'. 6) Mtrs '463'. 7) Mtrs '36t3'.These models are different from one another only in their number of inside windings and outside terminals and in their core limbs but other wise same in quality of their core material. The conventional<br><br>
transformer has cold rolled grain oriented (CRGO) type 3-leg core with 3 primary terminals and 4 secondary terminals referred in abbreviation as Trs '334'. The midgets are built with core treated under a newly invented process. The EI cores of CRGO type are submerged in tanks filled with the solutions of three herbals called 'KK', 'TS', 'KV diluted in pure water. . Their botanical/horticultural names are furnished at the end of these complete specifications. The total dissolvedrts per million. The molecular structure undergoes a magne salt (TDS) is maintained in and around 40 patic change rendering zero retentivity and attributing jacked up permeability to the core. Then these cores are interlaced with other type AMORPHOUS cores in suitable ratios and finally the combined core for the midget transformer is arrived at. The exact measurements of core sizes, the dipping and drying times and the core ratios in those two different materials for different ratings are calculated before manufacture. Hence the midgets are referred as Mtrs unlike Trs. They are Mtrs '363' Mtrs '369' Mtrs '433' Mtrs '466' Mtrs '436' Mtrs '463' and Mtrs 36t3'. The first digit denotes the core legs, the second digit the primary terminals and the third digit the secondary terminals. The 't' refers to the tapped primary or secondary meant for voltage regulation. These models Mtrs '36t3' are employed in place of the conventional on load tap changers (OLTCs) for boost or buck functions while the other midget models are employed in transmission and distribution in the systems. The entire core of all the midgets of all models undergo the above described special treatment process called 'uniform @/v' that ensures equal induced secondary voltages of same phase angles. These cores are dipped in that potion and dried akemately for definite times. To ensure uniform drying, they are dried in electrical ovens. The chemical percolates into the core and alters its molecular structure. The herbals in equal portions are cleaned and ground to a paste. The diluted mixture is neither acidic nor alkaline nor explosive but magnetic increasing the magnetic properties of the core with no magnetic retentivity and high<br><br>
permeability. The secondary output voltage and the phase angle of a midget in a 'inter networked' group is same. Hence it is called 'uniform@/v treatment process' hither to unknown. As one massive main transformer is replaced with many midgets, who directly can feed individual loads, the conventional bus bar is eliminated. Replacing a single 'main' with many midget transformers allows more ventilation in a much more economic way .The associated problems due to plurality do not accompany because of the simple and static nature of the trouble free transformers whose voltage, current and size are miniaturized. In LV systems like 33/1 Ikv, 33/430v, 22/430v, ll/430v substations, the cast resin dry-type insulation can be employed easily because of the size reductions. Due to adoption of dry-type windings, the transformers do not need outer shell or the oil thereby lessening the cost. Consequently the probable and possible electrocution, explosion and fire can never occur but instead additional facilities such as frequent and finer inspections arise uninterruptedly at any time as there is no oil nor the enclosing shell that obstructs view.<br>
There are TEN possible 'Inter- Network' modes for any midget group that can be connected to replace one main transformer in any SS. In any 'Inter Network' mode, the star or delta configuration is rendered only externally, making all the primaries to be either in star or delta and not internally as is the case with the conventional transformers.<br>
Mode l-'DP' refers to delta primary as shown in Fig (4) involving midgets of model '363'. The other two input and one output '363' version is used in stand-alone fashion for the purpose of UPS, the two inputs being of synchronism.<br>
Mode 2-'SP' refers to star primary of the above Fig (4) (to be modified)<br>
Mode 3- 'DP' refers to delta primary as shown in Fig (6) involving midgets of model '369'.<br>
Mode 4- 'SP' refers to star primary of the above Fig (6) (to be modified).<br><br>
Mode 5- 'DP' refers to delta primary as shown in Fig (10) Involving midgets of model '436' and model '463'. Strangely here the neutral is not connected but left out in isolated fashion. Mode 6- 'SP' refers to star primary of the above Fig (10) Mode 7-'DP' and Mode 8-'SP' relate to other midgets Mtrs '466'. Mode 9-'DP' and Mode lO-'SP' relate to other midgets Mtrs '469' The midgets of model '369' have each one additional winding apart from one primary and one secondary.  It is called the 'equalizer' winding and all the equalizers are connected as shown in mode 3 and mode 4. They are making the bus bars and the breakers redundant and the savings constitute in more than 50% of the materials  and  in cost.  The following table  indicates the comparisons.<br><br>

From the above table, it is clear that all the permutations and resultant functions are identical but varying only in the quantum of transformers.<br>
The 'main', 'mini' and 'midget' transformers are distinctly shown in Fig (1), Fig (2) and Fig (3) in single-phase versions. The 'mini' and the 'midget' may look functionally similar but the secondary can be separate and need not be conjoined in 'mini' but need be necessarily conjoined in 'midget' as shown in Figs (4) &amp; (9). To separate the two secondary outputs, equalizer windings are added to the midgets as shown in Fig (5). Its inclusion is one vital part of<br><br>
this invention. Here the mini's primary is functionally equal to two parallel 'subdivisions' of the mains primary. But the midget's primary is equal to two series 'segmentations' of the mains primary. Here the segmentation is for 'main' primary and subdivision is for 'main' secondary as shown in Fig (3) and again in Fig (7). The two terminologies 'subdivision' and 'segmentation' signify two methods of dissection of the winding. The connection as shown in Fig 6) after adding with equalizer windings performs the typical outputting function and results in surplusing of the output bus bars that is actually twice costly. For example, on one 33/1 Ikv and 16Mva bus bar and transformer system, the 11 kv output sides no longer require the 16Mva bus bar. Even if required as per the preliminary connection shown in Fig (4), it is just an economical 2Mva bus bars (that would suffice) as power would be tapped out at many intermittent junctions. The abundant bus-bar chamber earlier required for the transformer of Fig (1) has now become redundant as per Fig (6) and so it can be re-allotted to other sites and used there after necessary modification. The equalizer windings are preferably rated to be equal to the primary voltage, say 33kv in this case, and are slugged on to each midget connecting them in parallel. Equalizers without any restriction may be designed for any convenient voltage. The input 33kv cable in Fig (6) runs through all the midgets serially impressing equal fractional portions of the 33kv whereas the equalizer cable gets induced unifonnly to 33kv. The current in the equalizer cable may be in various segments in different directions as per the loading pattern. The primary cable handles 16Mva power and the equalizer winding handles just 2Mva power. For effecting these connections, single phase/single core cables are solely used. The midgets are conveniently accommodated inside the control room in place of that erstwhile and defunct bus bar chamber (that has been moved out elsewhere). A set of similar midgets powered from a second source can be placed in an interweaving way so that the output feeders can be switched over to the second source when the first source fails. These midgets can be spread in a row or in a zigzag or<br><br>
as the available space permits, an advantage that was never feasible before. Failure at the worst can occur only in a weakest midget safeguarding the others. Hence it is less catastrophic than when the massive main transformer or bus bar fails. So a total power outage for prolonged duration is ruled out in these revised connections. The quantum of interconnecting cables between the erstwhile main transformer to the indoor bus bar are now no longer required. Such cable savings are stupendous in cost in practical installations. Therefore the ten modes of 'INTER NETWORKED' connections are the new techniques as shown in drawing. Inside the conventional Transformer there is a copper bar permanently shorting terminals Ro,Yo,Bo,N forming a star point that is static. In the case of Midget Trs the star point is brought under control dynamics like 'for shorting' and 'un-shorting' and it is christened technically as the "Star node circuit breaker"that forms part of Mtr. If the star point of the output windings is break-opened, the power flow stops, if that star point is re-established, power flow resumes. Such star point control is made possible in these star node circuit breakers that are of three types, one with vacuum interruption 'VI' and another with air interruption 'AT and third one with SF6 interruption 'SI'. Their external housings are of cylindrical shape like the oil conservation tanks of conventional Trs and are taking in Ro, Yo, Bo and N. During power "on" time, the terminals and the neutral end denoted as Ro, Yo, Bo and N are shorted to one another firmly by a movable copper bar that has been slugged with CTs and then the power flows out through the opposite end terminals Rx, Yx, Bx to outside loads. During "off time they (Ro, Yo, Bo,N) are isolated from one another stopping the power flow. This type of star node control inside this cylindrical shaped controller tames the switching transients increasing life spans of all equipments inclusive of it. The Rx, Yx, Bx supply terminals rest on lightening arresters in order to ground any un-due spike that renders the needed safety. The output terminals at the transformer are provided with draw out type contact arrangement that is separable from load side feeder<br><br>
lines. They can be pulled and separated apart safely during feeder maintenance. As delta type connection among the midget transformers is formed through external cables as in Fig (8), the CTs measuring input power are on the phases instead of on the lines. Then more accuracy in measurement and control is made possible. If there is only a short distance from the preceding SS, then the star connection can be resorted to instead of delta at the primary side of this SS so as to further reduce in cables and bring further refinement in voltage regulation.<br>
For voltage regulation purpose the midgets of model '36t3' can be added at the low voltage end of the midget groups namely the star node end or midway. But here the servo stabilization method with a difference, the sensing and control lines being different can also be used for 1 Ikv/ 415v applications. The buck-boost transformer is so designed in ratings that it receives its primary supply from the LT variable autotransformers fitted on the consumable 430v and its secondary winding suitably matched and connected in series with the HT boosts or bucks. Beyond 11 kv this technique is not employed but instead midget of model '36t3' is employed. As all midget transformers of the group undergo equal loading at all times, one common PT itself can meter the entire power. But all the outgoing feeders of the midgets which will have, however their own individual CTs would have to aid the above measurement. This method will result in saving of PTs. The CTs employed are fitted at the neutral side of the midget group and so they are not subjected to high voltages. The above arrangement is suitable to EB Substations.<br>
The llkv/430v Factory Electrical Substations<br>
In any electrical substation, the transformers should be ideally located for the material saving and line loss reduction. It is ideal at the center of the loads. But practically in vast premises no one particular location could be found and even if correctly decided it might change over a period.    For safety of the men and the<br><br>
materials the transformer is normally installed nowadays in a far off place outside the factory premises forgoing the cost benefits. After advent of the dry type transformer, the inner premises of a factory are no longer out of bounds for it and so accommodated inside. This invention facilitates splitting of main transformer into many small midget transformers. There is only one single HT feeder inputting power to the entire lot of midgets with every midget primary in series to another midget in succession. In this group of midgets only one midget can have tap changer facility as in Mtr '36t3'. Every midget transformer must output equal voltage at equal phase angle with no harmonics. Therefore the equalizer cable provides an excursion path for certain unequal 'feeder load' currents, whose magnitude is not much but limited. But the size of the equalizer cable is over designed to carry the full load current of one individual midget transformer. During mains failure, this equalizer cable can be ernployed to carry generator power and feed to all the essential loads of the factory premises as in Fig (9). The equalizer cable therefore avoids the need of another distinct and separate cable for the generator. Transient voltage suppression at the HT side contact points is accomplished by the capacitors connected across the equalizer cable at the LT side. In a site, instead of one oil cooled 3000 kva transformer 5 Nos of 600 kva midget transformers are placed near the individual sub switch boards inside the premises. These midget transformers are directly plugged into switch boards, thereby saving in cables from the obsolete main transformer to the obsolete main switch board. The saving is to the tune of approx 7 x 3 x 135m = 2835 meters of 400 sq mm cables (that would have required for inputting power to the 7 Nos of sub switch boards). The accrued savings in materials is about 50%. In addition, the main conventional massive switch board with its seven or more LT 800 amps ACBs is also eliminated. In this application one 250m of HT cable is the only additional provision which is at a meager cost and it avoids the huge costly cable concrete trench<br><br>
that probably would have been a 5 ft high tunnel. The above savings are made possible through this invention using midgets of model '363'<br>
Electrical substations in multi-storied buildings<br>
A multi-storied building has three phase and single phase loads at terrace and other floors. To cater to them, the electrical substation at ground level far away from building is placed for safety. If the transformer is cast resin dry type which option was made possible through this invention then the midget transformer will be accepted anywhere inside the buildings as the safety is not jeopardized. This relates to the twin secondary, each rated at different voltage one of three phase three wire 430v and the second one of three phase three wire 220v with absentee neutrals. Such a strange 'Dual output transformer' with floating neutrals will have an extra core limb as found in midget of models '436' or '466' This extra limb provides path to the unbalanced flux of the three cores. As all the big loads like lift-motors and pump-motors and a/c motors are at the terrace, the substation may be located at the terrace itself contrary to the crude convention. If the total load is much heavier, say, more than 1000 kva it may be decided to avail 33kv instead of usual 11kv at the primary side to reduce line losses. By avoiding the intermediate 33 to llkv transformation the line breakdowns also reduce. Along the stand-by generator in the ground floor, a two-tier panel board also is usually fixed as convention but it is obsolete in this method. This costly panel board is avoided by restructuring the rising mains to be of six bar type as in Fig (10) and to be fed by dual output transformer at one end at terrace and by the generator at the other end at ground. A bus coupler in the rising mains somewhere in middle when in open status aids the simultaneous use of both EB supply and genset supply for sharing of loads. If only the terrace and the ground floor are having three phase loads and rest of the floors are having single-phase loads then one dual output transformer at terrace and another at ground is<br><br>
added as shown in Fig (10b). One set of three bar rising mains with absentee neutral connects the three phase 220v outputs of both top and bottom located transformers to feed single-phase loads of intermediate floors. The other three phase 430v outputs at extreme floors feed their own assigned lift-motors and other motors . This method drastically reduces cables and LT panel boards by more than 50%. If the single phase loads are plenty and power intensive then some more conventional single output midget transformers of model '463' are also included in the intermediate floors. It can be alternately called "A two stage a MASSIVE to many MIDGETS segmentation and sub-division" as typically shown in fig (10). The main primary is segmented and the main secondary is sub-divided and the main transformer is split to many midgets and hence this name. This invention comprises of a process 'uniform@/v treatment' in manufacture of magnetic core, a technique in terminals connections and a set of new devices in the form midget transformers and star node circuit breakers. Here too in multi-storied buildings, a large material savings of 50% and energy savings at 4% and maintenance relief of to an extent of 50% is realized. The three herbals denoted in the previous page 6 are hereby referi'ed by their botanical/horticultural names.<br>
'K K' = NATONIA GRANDIFLORA. 'T S' = MYMOSA PUDICA. 'K V = MURAYA KOENGII<br><br><br><br><br>
I CLAIM: -<br>
1)	The Midget transformer wherein the core is cold rolled grain oriented (CRGO) and treated under 'Uniform @/V process for high efficiency and interlaced with Amorphous core where the secondary output voltages and their phase angles of all the Midget transformers in a given group tends to be the same with the least losses, "the core is alternately dipped and dried in a solution of 'KK', 'TS', 'KV that is diluted in pure water with Total Dissolved Salt (TDS) of 40 and then used for manufacture.<br>
2)	The Midget transformer as claimed in claim 1) above is built with (more than 2 sets) multi sets of supply terminals on 3 or 4 legged core and referred as models '363', '369', '433', '436', '463', '466' and '36t3'where for three phase supply with absentee neutral, the 4-legged core only is employed for the unbalanced flux to pass through the fourth leg.<br>
3)	The Midget transformer as claimed in claims 1) &amp; 2) above but the one pertaining to model '36t3' has taps in its winding either at its primary or secondary to suit the site conditions; the alphabet 't' in this model number signifies that variation.<br>
4)	The Midget transformer '36t3' as claimed in claims in 1) &amp; 2) &amp; 3) above has taps on its secondary if the in between distance from Midget to Midget of a group is in the order of kilometers.<br>
5)	The Midget transformer '36t3' as claimed in claims in 1) &amp; 2) &amp; 3) above has taps on its primary if the Midget-to-Midget distance is in the order of a few meters.<br>
6)	The Midget transformer as claimed in claims 1) &amp; 2) above except model '36t3' that has an option is invariably with built in Star Node Circuit- Breaker (SNCB)^ The Midget transformer's output secondary side and that neutral side terminals denoted as Ro, Yo, Bo, are terminated on the cylindrically shaped Star Node Circuit Breaker; The SNCB at its concentric center inside the chamber has a insulated rotating shaft fitted with conducting contacts arrangement<br><br>
and the neutral side of the breaker with three terminals shorted and fitted with three current transformers (CTs); By externally applied force the inside shaft can be rotated clock wise or anti clockwise; the circularly sweeping straight copper bars have a provision for spark-less switching facility that may or may not need solid-state device.<br>
7) The Midget transformer's Star Node Circuit Breaker as claimed in claim 1) to claim 6) above is either in open execution involving air interruption type ('AI') for 415 v applications or in closed execution involving vacuum interruption type ('VI') for 11 kv to 33 kv applications and involving SF6 interruption type ('SI') for still higher vohage.<br>
8) The Midget transformer as claimed in claim 1) to claim 7) above excepting the '363'model's twin version of two power input versus one output mode (ie) its stand alone mode for UPS purpose, shall function only as a team mate in a group that is network connected amongst them to one another either in delta primary mode of connection or in star primary mode of connection and in combinations of models as shown in drawings of figures three to ten (3-10).<br>
