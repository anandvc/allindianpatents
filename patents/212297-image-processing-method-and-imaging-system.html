				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to image processing method and imaging system, and it relates<br>
generally to the field of digital imaging and computer graphics. More specifically, the<br>
invention relates to methods for performing digital image processing and compression.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
In small, portable devices such as digital still<br>
cameras, image compression schemes should be suited to<br>
reduce the storage requirements and processing time of<br>
captured sensor images still maintaining acceptable<br>
picture quality even after compression and<br>
decompression. When storage requirements and processing<br>
time are reduced, the overall power consumption of the<br>
device is also reduced since the VLSI (Very Large Scale<br>
Integration) chip performing the processing is more<br>
compact. The reduction of the bit rate for transmission<br>
or storage of still image and motion video will also<br>
speed the process of capturing images and thus, speed<br>
the downloading of them to a PC (personal computer) or<br>
other more complex data processing systems. Quick<br>
capture and compression of an image will allow such<br>
cameras to transition to the next image, i.e., to the<br>
next click of the camera speedily.<br>
Image compression, whether performed by hardware<br>
such as VLSI chip or by software, can be classified as<br>
either "lossy" or "lossless". With lossless<br>
compression, the original image prior to compression can<br>
be retrieved exactly when the compressed image is<br>
decompressed. Consequently, lossless techniques, whose<br>
compression ratios depend greatly upon the entropy of an<br>
image, do not achieve high compression ratios and, since<br>
they preserve a high percentage of original image<br>
information, are computationally expensive. By<br>
contrast, lossy compression provides only an<br>
approximation of the original image. Thus, with lossy<br>
compression, greater compression ratios can be achieved<br>
but traditionally with lower image quality compared to<br>
lossless techniques. One such lossy technique, referred<br>
to as "predictive coding" (also called Digital Pulse<br>
Code Modulation (DPCM), well-known in the art), predicts<br>
the value of a successive pixel by linearly combining<br>
the properties of already processed neighboring pixels.<br>
An error pixel is defined as the difference between the<br>
original image pixel and the corresponding predicted<br>
pixel. The error pixel, represented as a color value,<br>
is quantized and then binary encoded. Traditionally,<br>
the quantization has been performed distinct from the<br>
encoding, which lends to complexity in the processing<br>
circuitry.<br>
Even with lossy compression schemes, the process of<br>
quantization and encoding is often very compute<br>
intensive. Thus, it would be desirable to reduce or<br>
eliminate the computing of quantization and encoding<br>
within a small device such as a digital camera. Doing<br>
so would reduce the circuitry or chip area required and<br>
also, the power consumption.<br>
With lossy techniques, as traditionally employed,<br>
image quality suffers. It would also be desirable in<br>
situations where captured image quality is important,<br>
such as a digital camera, to employ a compression scheme<br>
that is "visually-lossless". A "visually-lossless"<br>
scheme would technically be lossy, but due to certain<br>
properties would model the human visual system. To the<br>
naked eye, images compressed using a "visually-lossless"<br>
scheme would appear approximately identical to the<br>
original image.<br>
The implementation of such computationally<br>
intensive techniques demands more VLSI circuitry than is<br>
suitable for digital cameras and portable, small devices<br>
desiring image compression. Thus, there is a need for a<br>
more efficient process to perform techniques while<br>
conserving power. Also, there is a need to preserve<br>
image quality as it relates to the human visual system<br>
such that a lossy image appears to the unaided eye as<br>
"lossless".<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

are suitable to compress images, said table providing a compression scheme that<br>
polynomially relates an error value, which is the difference between two pixels, and a<br>
quantized error value based on a polynomial characterized by the human visual perception<br>
system.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to the figures, exemplary embodiments of<br>
the invention will now be described. The exemplary<br>
embodiments are provided to illustrate aspects of the<br>
invention and should not be construed as limiting the<br>
scope of the invention. The exemplary embodiments are<br>
primarily described with reference to block diagrams or<br>
flowcharts. As to the flowcharts, each block within the<br>
flowcharts represents both a method step and an<br>
apparatus element for performing the method step.<br>
Depending upon the implementation, the corresponding<br>
apparatus element may be configured in hardware,<br>
software, firmware or combinations thereof.<br>
Figure 1 is a flowchart of one embodiment of the<br>
invention.<br>
In this embodiment, one step in attaining a compact<br>
and efficient image compression is to pre-compile a<br>
table of quantized error values and codes (step 110).<br>
The total number of possible error values, where error<br>
is defined as the difference between a predicted pixel<br>
(or average of pixels) and the current pixel, will be<br>
based on the desired color resolution of each pixel<br>
(described below). For each possible error value, a<br>
corresponding quantized error value is calculated by<br>
some data processing system such as a computer. As will<br>
be detailed below, each quantized error value will have<br>
a Huffman (or other entropy encoding) code equivalent.<br>
Huffman coding is well-known in the art of digital<br>
encoding and data compression. A single table of<br>
integrated original quantized error values, and Huffman<br>
code equivalents and the like will be stored in table<br>
form on the data processing system.<br>
Once the table is pre-compiled, prior to any image<br>
capture or compression, the table is loaded into RAM<br>
(Random Access Memory) or ROM (Read Only Memory) units<br>
within the camera (step 120). Since memory is<br>
inexpensive and power-preserving compared to<br>
logic/arithmetic circuitry, pre-compiling such a table<br>
offers significant cost and design advantages.<br>
Once the table is loaded into the camera, for the<br>
image compression scheme represented by that table, the<br>
table need not be re-compiled or reloaded. As shown in<br>
Figure 3, if the image compression scheme changes, the<br>
table can be re-compiled and loaded to replace or append<br>
the prior table. According to step 130, images that are<br>
captured by the lens-sensor system of the camera can be<br>
compressed on-the-fly using a look-up table approach.<br>
The captured pixels are composed of R, G, and B (Red,<br>
Green and Blue) color planes, and the procedure of<br>
predictive coding is applied to each captured pixel in<br>
the R, G, and B planes simultaneously.<br>
When the image is completely captured and<br>
compressed, the next image may be similarly processed,<br>
without any reload or re-compile of the table. Either<br>
one by one, or in groups, the compressed images may then<br>
be downloaded to a data processing or computer system<br>
which can perform decompression of the image(s) (step<br>
140). Utilizing the "visually-lossless" approach<br>
described below, the resultant image will appear to the<br>
eye as a near perfect reconstruction of the captured<br>
image. An advantage to the methodology of table look-up<br>
compression is the speed at which a captured image can<br>
be compressed, thus allowing the camera to be ready to<br>
capture the next image. A further advantage is that the<br>
decompression, which decodes and inverse quantizes to<br>
approximate the captured image, can also be achieved<br>
using the same table loaded to the camera. These<br>
details, as well as the-visually-lossless algorithm, are<br>
described below.<br>
Figure 2 is a detailed flow diagram of pre-<br>
compiling an image compression table according to one<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br>
The first step in pre-compiling an image<br>
compression table is to compute a quantized error value<br>
for each designated error value. An image pixel can be<br>
split into R, G and B plane components and, assuming<br>
that N bits is utilized for each color plane, then the<br>
pixel in total would be defined in 3*N bits. Predictive<br>
coding schemes operate on each color plane independently<br>
and simultaneously. Thus, the error, which is the<br>
difference between a predicted pixel component and the<br>
original pixel component, would range from -(2N-1) to 2N-<br>
1 yielding a total number of possible error value of<br>
2N+1-1. For example, a 24-bit color image would consist<br>
of pixels that have 8-bit R components, 8-bit G<br>
components and 8-bit B components. For each pixel<br>
component, the lower limit of error is 0-255 = -255,<br>
while the upper limit is 255-0 = 255, giving a total of<br>
28+1-1 = 511 error values. According to step 210, then,<br>
for each of the 2N+1-1 error values, a quantized error<br>
value is calculated. The quantized error value,<br>
according to the visually-lossless scheme proposed in<br>
various embodiments of the invention, takes the form of<br>
y = (x-C)a+C, where y is the quantized error, x the<br>
original error and C, the threshold, and "a" the entropy<br>
encoding factor derived from the response of the human<br>
visual perception system (response of the human optical<br>
system to visual input and its interpretation by the<br>
human brain). Further details of the quantization<br>
computation are described below with respect to<br>
Figure 4.<br>
The above example is a form of predictive coding<br>
which can be one or multi-dimensional in its prediction.<br>
A one-dimensional would take as a predicted pixel<br>
component, the predicted "West" neighboring pixel<br>
component, which is the pixel component (R,G,B) of the<br>
same row, but the previous column in the image. A two-<br>
dimensional predictive coding scheme will first take,<br>
for instance, the predicted "North" pixel component<br>
neighbor and the "West" neighbor and average the two<br>
together. This average of previous predicted pixel<br>
components is then subtracted from the current original<br>
image pixel to obtain the error value. To minimize the<br>
propagation of errors due to quantization of these error<br>
values, a feedback recovery may be applied to "recover"<br>
by inverse quantization and approximation of the error.<br>
This approximation obtained by inverse quantization can<br>
be summed with the predicted pixel component (or<br>
average) to recover the error, at least in part.<br>
Referring still to Figure 2, the next step in the<br>
process is to classify the quantized error values into a<br>
distinct set of classes (step 220). The number of<br>
classes will depend upon both the number of bits<br>
required to encode the quantized error value and upon<br>
the value of C, the threshold in the quantized error<br>
formula. Binary encoding which is utilized in this<br>
embodiment of the invention is inherently bitwise.<br>
Thus, the decoding of a binary coded value is<br>
computationally complex since bitwise processing is<br>
necessary. However, by classifying the quantized error<br>
values, the decoding of the generated Codeword<br>
equivalent is greatly simplified. An example is<br>
provided below. After classifying the quantized error<br>
values, a Codeword equivalent can be generated for each<br>
quantized error value (step 230) . Each quantized error<br>
value can be represented by a pair of binary values<br>
(H,M), where H is the Huffman code of the class and M is<br>
the one"s complement representation of the quantized<br>
error value in that class. The pair (H,M) when<br>
concatenated together as the sequence of bits "HM"<br>
represents the prefix Codeword. As will be shown, this<br>
prefix Codeword greatly simplifies the decoding<br>
process. Once the Codeword equivalent is generated for<br>
each quantized error value, the integrated quantized<br>
error values and their corresponding Codeword<br>
equivalents are stored into the image compression table<br>
(step 240). Further, the next step is to store, for<br>
each Codeword equivalent, the bit length of the Codeword<br>
equivalent (step 250).<br>
The Codeword equivalent generated by the (H,M) pair<br>
is a variable length prefix code. The Codeword<br>
equivalent is stored into a table as a decimal value,<br>
e.g., if the Codeword equivalents of unquantized error<br>
values 2, 25, 100 are 0, 10111, 111010, they are stored<br>
into the table in a byte as a decimal value 0, 23, 58,<br>
respectively. Though the Codeword equivalents 0, 23,<br>
and 58 are actually stored in eight bits (bytes) as<br>
00000000, 00010111, 00111010, respectively, only one bit<br>
is significant for the Codeword equivalent 0. Likewise,<br>
only the last 5 bits of 00010111 are significant for the<br>
Codeword equivalent 23 and only the last 6 bits of<br>
00111010 is significant for the Codeword equivalent 58.<br>
Hence, since all Codeword equivalents are stored<br>
optimally as the same number of bits, length information<br>
is desired to be able to extract the variable length<br>
code from the memory bytes of the look-up table. The<br>
variable-length Codeword equivalents are packed together<br>
in eight-bit bytes and output to the compressed file.<br>
For example, let us assume that the quantized error<br>
values are 99, 25, -2, 0, 9, 0, 0, 55, 100, the output<br>
codes are 111011, 10110, 0, 0, 10101, 0, 0, 111000,<br>
111011. They are packed in eight-bit bytes as<br>
and output to the compressed file. Hence, the length<br>
information is needed to prepare the output bytes such<br>
that they be "unpacked" correctly upon decompression.<br>
The image compression table(s) can contain an index<br>
of quantized error values and for each quantized error<br>
value, the Codeword equivalent and the length of the<br>
Codeword equivalent. The same table can be utilized for<br>
all the color planes. Thus, the image compression table<br>
at most has 2N+1-1 indexes or addresses where N<br>
represents the number of bits in each color component<br>
(R,G,B) of the pixels in the image. The procedure of<br>
pre-compiling the image compression table need only be<br>
performed once and can be applied to each color plane<br>
without modification. Thus, the R, G and B compression<br>
processes can share a single image compression table.<br>
The image compression table, by representing<br>
Codeword equivalents for quantized error values,<br>
integrates the quantization and binary encoding process.<br>
The table integrates quantization and binary encoding by<br>
providing, for each quantized error code submitted as an<br>
index to the table, a Codeword equivalent. Thus, the<br>
steps architecture of separate binary encoding is<br>
eliminated.<br>
Figure 3 is a flowchart of yet another embodiment<br>
of the invention.<br>
A single image compression table represents a<br>
particular image quality or compression ratio. Testing<br>
and experimentation have shown that for the quantized<br>
error formula y = (x-C)a+C, a value of "a" = 0.45<br>
derived from human visual system response gives<br>
excellent visually-lossless properties. Such visually-<br>
lossless image compression is excellent for still images<br>
since it represents "perception" of the human brain of<br>
received visual stimulus such as color and shape. The<br>
threshold value, C, has also be found through testing to<br>
be good at a value of 3. The rigors of the formula are<br>
described below. If a different level of compression is<br>
desired, the level of "visual-losslessness" may be<br>
reduced and the image compression ratio increased.<br>
The human visual perception system, upon which<br>
various embodiments of the invention are based, consists<br>
of the optical system (lens, cornea, etc.) as well as<br>
the brain and nervous systems which interpret what the<br>
eye gathers from its surroundings. The eye and human<br>
optical system will, based on reflected light, send to<br>
the brain a set of image data much like a camera but far<br>
less discrete. The brain interprets what the eye<br>
"captures" and this interpretation is what is "seen" by<br>
humans. The fineness of the image, clarity, and color<br>
resolution depends on the discernibility of the part of<br>
brain processing visual stimuli. Thus, if the human eye<br>
can only distinguish, for example, 1,000,000 colors, for<br>
the purposes of presenting it to a human an image<br>
printed or displayed with more colors is extraneous.<br>
Likewise, certain other characteristics of the human<br>
visual perception system such as edge detection can, if<br>
understood, be used to simplify the image compression<br>
scheme for an application such as a digital camera.<br>
In the digital camera instance, the modeling of the<br>
human visual perception system will produce the<br>
"visually-lossless" result referred to in various<br>
embodiments of the invention. The formula for<br>
quantization y = (x-C)a+C with an "a" of 0.45 and "C" of<br>
3 closely models the human visual perception system to<br>
still images. The error is tolerable and virtually<br>
indistinguishable to the naked eye if those parameters<br>
are utilized. Though the invention in various<br>
embodiments contemplates the use of look-up tables so<br>
that the quantization is pre-computed and compiled, one<br>
skilled in the art would readily be able to adopt the<br>
human visual perception modeling herein to a non-look-up<br>
table based approach, where quantization is computed on-<br>
the-fly. One such approach may include software<br>
compression where a computer programmed application<br>
executes visually-lossless compression using y = (x-<br>
C)a+C or a variation thereof, within the computer system<br>
on an already stored image or upon images that are<br>
streamed to the application.<br>
Different image compression ratios and qualities<br>
will be desired for different types of applications. To<br>
facilitate this, the user of the imaging system can<br>
select on the data processing system on which the table<br>
is pre-compiled or from the camera/imaging system the<br>
desired quality and/or compression level (step 310).<br>
Next, the software queries the memory or disk where<br>
image compression tables may be stored if the image<br>
compression table corresponding to the desired<br>
quality/compression level exists (step 320). If the<br>
corresponding image compression table does exist, then<br>
the data processing system loads the corresponding table<br>
into the camera/imaging system (step 340). In an<br>
alternative embodiment, more than one different image<br>
compression table may be stored in the camera/imaging<br>
system, but in small digital cameras, a single optimal<br>
table at any given time is adequate and least intrusive.<br>
If the camera/imaging system were to have multiple table<br>
capability, then the imaging system may as well be<br>
queried for already containing the proper table.<br>
If no corresponding image compression table exists,<br>
the next step is to set a gamma, "a", and a threshold C<br>
for the quantized error value formula y = (x-C)a+C (step<br>
330) . The gamma and threshold values will vary from<br>
compression scheme to compression scheme, but can be<br>
readily tabulated to be available in case a certain<br>
scheme (compression ratio/quality) is desired. Using<br>
the gamma and threshold corresponding to the desired<br>
scheme, the next step is to compile a new image<br>
compression table using those values (step 335). The<br>
compiling of the image compression table has been<br>
described with respect to Figure 2.<br>
Once the image compression is located or compiled,<br>
the table is loaded into the camera (step 340). After<br>
the table is loaded into the camera, images may be<br>
compressed on the camera (step 350). These images will<br>
have a quality/compression ratio commensurate with the<br>
selected quality/compression. Alternatively, the<br>
selection of quality/compression ratio may be arrived at<br>
automatically by the data processing system or imaging<br>
system based on the specific application which will use<br>
the image.<br>
Figure 4 is a flowchart of computing quantized<br>
error values according to one embodiment of the<br>
invention.<br>
Assuming that the gamma "a" and threshold C are<br>
already determined, the following methodology is used to<br>
compute quantized error values. The appropriate form of<br>
the basic equation y = (x-C)a+C depends upon the range<br>
of x, the error value. If x is greater than C (checked<br>
at step 410), then the form y = (x-C)a+C is applied. To<br>
apply this form, the first step is to calculate the<br>
intermediate value I1 = (x-C) (step 412). Next, I1, is<br>
raised to the power of a to yield I2 (step 414).<br>
Finally, the value of C is added to the value I2 to<br>
arrive at Y1 which will be a positive quantized error<br>
value (step 416). Only the integer portion of the<br>
quantized error value y is stored, and thus, the value y<br>
is to be truncated (step 418) prior to table insertion.<br>
If x is greater than -C but less then or equal to C<br>
(checked at step 420), then y is judged to be zero (step<br>
422) .<br>
If the error value falls below -C (checked at step<br>
430), then the next step is to take the absolute value<br>
of the error value (step 432). Then, the intermediate<br>
value J1 is calculated by subtracting C from the absolute<br>
value of the error value (step 434). Next, J1 is raised<br>
to the power a, to yield J2 (step 436). Next, the value<br>
C is added to J2 to form J3 (step 438) . Finally, since<br>
the error value is a negative number, the quantized<br>
error value should also be a negative. This is achieved<br>
by negating J3 (step 440). These quantized error values<br>
are utilized to compress an image by compressing the<br>
error of the image.<br>
Figure 5 is an image compression table with sample<br>
values according to one embodiment of the invention.<br>
The table of Figure 5 has sample values for 8-bit<br>
color plane values. Each color plane, R, G and B, if<br>
composed of 8 bits will yield an image when decompressed<br>
with pixels of 24-bit color resolution. The image<br>
compression table of Figure 5 is equally applicable to<br>
all three color planes, since all three planes have the<br>
same range of possible error values. As described<br>
above, the possible error values between a pixel and a<br>
predicted pixel will be -255 to +255 for each plane<br>
assuming 8-bit color planes. The table of Figure 5<br>
shows 28 of the possible 511 error values as they would<br>
be quantized. One embodiment of the invention<br>
calculates the quantized error value using the<br>
expression y = (x-C)a+C, where x is the error value<br>
(column 1 of Figure 5) and y, the quantized error value<br>
(truncated, column 2 of Figure 5). The quantized error<br>
values shown in Figure 5 correspond to a gamma "a"<br>
value of 0.45 and a threshold C of 3. As Figure 5<br>
shows, by applying the methodology of Figure 4 with a =<br>
0.45 and C = 3, 511 error values have been compacted<br>
into only 25 quantized values. Though these error<br>
values relate to only one R, G or B pixel, interpolation<br>
may be used to combine neighboring pixels into a higher,<br>
such as 24-bit pixel, resolution image.<br>
Once the quantized error values shown in column 2<br>
of Figure 5 are compiled, then classification of the<br>
error values can be performed. The threshold C<br>
determines the classification by identifying the number<br>
of classes. In this case, C is 3, so the number of<br>
classes is 3. The first class, class 0, are the error<br>
values that lie between -C and C, or in this example, -3<br>
and 3. All these error values correspond, using the<br>
methodology of Figure 4, to quantized error values of<br>
0. The second class, class 3 is so named because a<br>
maximum of three bits are preferred to encode the<br>
unsigned quantized error values between 4 and 7 and -4<br>
and -7. The next class, class 4, consists of the<br>
quantized error values between 8 and 15 and -8 and -15<br>
which require four bits to encode.<br>
Once classification is achieved for the quantized<br>
error values, then the Codeword can be constructed. The<br>
Codeword equivalent for each quantized error value takes<br>
the form "HM" where H is the Huffman code of the class<br>
to which the quantized error value belongs and M is the<br>
binary representation of the quantized error value.<br>
Negative quantized error values take on M values of the<br>
binary complement of the unsigned number in its binary<br>
form. The Huffman code of the class and M are<br>
concatenated to form the Codeword equivalent. As a<br>
first example, an error value of 31 has a quantized<br>
error value (as computed with a=0.45 and C=3) of 7. A<br>
quantized error value of 7 belongs to class 3. The<br>
Huffman code of "3" is "10" and thus, H is 10. The<br>
value 7 in binary form is 111 in three bits, and thus, M<br>
is 111. Thus, the Codeword equivalent for a quantized<br>
error value of 7 is "HM" or 10111. The value "10111" is<br>
stored next to the quantized error value of 7. As an<br><br>
second example, an error value of -119 has a<br>
corresponding quantized error value of -11. "-H"<br>
belongs to class 4, and thus H (the Huffman code of "4")<br>
is 11 (binary). M is the complement of the unsigned<br>
decimal number 11 which is "0100." Thus, the Codeword<br>
equivalent is "110100" for a quantized error value of -<br>
11.<br>
The quantized error values and Codeword equivalents<br>
are likewise compiled for all possible quantized error<br>
values between -255 and 255. As discussed above, the<br>
length of each Codeword equivalent should also be stored<br>
in order to packing of the Codeword equivalents into<br>
suitable data structures for communications transport.<br>
The Codeword equivalents represent an integration of the<br>
traditional distinct processes of quantization and<br>
encoding.<br>
Additionally, the image compression table can also<br>
store the inverse of the quantized error values. When<br>
the image is being recovered or decomposed, the inverse<br>
quantized error values are utilized. The inverse<br>
quantized error values are calculated by using the<br>
formula Xinv = (y-C)a+C, where y is the quantized error<br>
value and Xinv is the inverse quantized error value.<br>
Though the inverse values only approximate the original<br>
error values prior to quantization (e.g., 255 is<br>
quantized as 15, and inversed as 253), this is quite<br>
adequate for visually-lossless compression since the<br>
error introduced is imperceptible by the human visual<br>
perception system.<br>
Figure 6 is a system diagram of one embodiment of<br>
the invention.<br>
Illustrated is a computer system 610, which may be<br>
any general or special purpose computing or data<br>
processing machine such as a PC (personal computer),<br>
coupled to a camera 63 0. Camera 63 0 may be a digital<br>
camera, digital video camera, or any image capture<br>
device or imaging system, and is utilized to capture a<br>
sensor image of an object 640. Essentially, captured<br>
images are compressed by an image compression circuit<br>
632 so that they can be efficiently stored in an image<br>
memory unit 634, which may be a RAM or other storage<br>
device such as a fixed disk, miniature card, etc. In<br>
most digital cameras, images are stored first and<br>
downloaded later. This allows the camera 63 0 to capture<br>
the next object quickly without additional delay.<br>
Image processing in this embodiment of the<br>
invention operates as follows. First, an image<br>
compression table, if not already compiled, is compiled<br>
using computer system 610. The methodology described in<br>
various other embodiments of the invention is executed-<br>
using a processor 612 such as the Pentium™ (a product of<br>
Intel Corporation) and a memory 611, such as RAM, which<br>
is used to store/load instruction addresses and result<br>
data. The application used to compile the image<br>
compression table may be an executable file compiled<br>
from source written in a language such as C++. The<br>
instructions of that executable file, which correspond<br>
with instructions necessary to compute quantized error<br>
values. Codeword equivalents and index these and other<br>
values into a table, which may be stored to a disk 618<br>
or memory 611. It would be obvious to one of ordinary<br>
skill in the art to program a computing machine to<br>
compile the image compression table, provided that the<br>
described methodology is disclosed.<br>
Computer system 610 has a system bus 613 which<br>
facilitates information transfer to/from the processor<br>
and memory and a bridge -614 which couples to an I/O bus<br>
615. I/O bus 615 connects various I/O devices such as a<br>
display adapter 616, disk 618 and an I/O port, such as a<br>
serial port. Many such combinations of I/O devices,<br>
buses and bridges can be utilized with the invention and<br>
the combination shown is merely illustrative of one such<br>
possible combination.<br>
Once the table is compiled, it can be sent through<br>
I/O port 617 and loaded into image compression circuit<br>
632 as a RAM or memory utilized by the image compression<br>
circuit 632. The table, once loaded, can thereafter be<br>
utilized by the image compression circuit 632.<br>
When an image, such as an image of object 640, is<br>
captured, the image is sensed by R, G, and B pixels and<br>
these pixel values are sent to the image compression<br>
circuit 632. Image compression circuit 632 consists of<br>
ICs and other components which execute an image<br>
compression scheme such as predictive coding. The image<br>
compression circuit 632 calculates initial error values<br>
according to a predictive coding formula, and then,<br>
looks up both the corresponding quantized error value<br>
and Codeword equivalent for the error value and stores<br>
that into the image memory unit 634. By looking up the<br>
values in the image compression table, the steps of<br>
quantization and encoding do not have to be performed by<br>
the camera. The total cost of the camera is reduced by<br>
avoiding the additional circuitry used to perform<br>
quantization and encoding of error values. Once all<br>
pixels are processed for the image, the camera 630 can<br>
capture the next image. When the user or application<br>
desires/requests a download of images, the compressed<br>
images stored in the image memory unit as packed<br>
Codewords are transferred from image memory unit 634 to<br>
the I/O Port 617. I/O port 617 uses the bus-bridge<br>
hierarchy shown (I/O bus 615 to bridge 614 to system bus<br>
613) to temporarily store the Codeword into memory 611<br>
or, optionally, disk 618. The compressed images are<br>
decompressed by suitable application software (or<br>
hardware), which may utilize processor 612 for its<br>
execution. Since the image compression table will have<br>
been compiled on the computer system, it can be reused<br><br>
to "look-up" in reverse the actual error value<br>
corresponding to the Codeword. The error values are<br>
used in an inverse predictive coding (or other<br>
corresponding image decompression scheme) to produce a<br>
decompressed image 650. Decompressed image 650 may then<br>
be rendered visually using a display adapter 616 onto a<br>
monitor 620 to which the computer system 610 may be<br>
connected.<br>
The decompressed image 650 will be "visually-<br>
lossless" if an image compression table with an "a"<br>
value of 0.45 and a threshold C of 3 is compiled and<br>
used in camera 630. The image is visually-lossless<br>
since the formula y = (x-C)a+C, when utilized to compute<br>
and compile the image compression table will model the<br>
human visual system. Thus, to the user, the<br>
decompressed image 650 will appear virtually<br>
indistinguishable, given adequate display devices<br>
(monitor 620 and adapter 616), with the appearance of<br>
the original object 640. Likewise, other images<br>
captured by the camera can be decompressed and output on<br>
monitor 620 and each will maintain a visually-lossless<br>
quality if the methodology of the various embodiments of<br>
the invention and alternatives thereof, are followed.<br>
The exemplary embodiments described herein are<br>
provided merely to illustrate the principles of the<br>
invention and should not be construed as limiting the<br>
