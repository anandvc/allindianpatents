				<td>METHOD FOR PREPARING A PHOTOCATALYTIC COATING<br>
INTEGRATED INTO GLAZING HEAT TREATMENT<br>
The present invention relates to glazing provided with<br>
a coating exhibiting photocatalytic properties, of the<br>
type comprising at least partially crystallized-<br>
titanium oxide, especially in anatase form.<br>
Several techniques are known for forming such a<br>
coating, especially on a glass sheet, with a view to<br>
obtaining a product of high optical quality. Available<br>
techniques include, for example, a sole-gel process,<br>
consisting in depositing a titanium dioxide precursor<br>
in solution followed by heating so as to form the<br>
dioxide crystallized in anatase form, a pyrolysis<br>
process, especially CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition), in<br>
which titanium dioxide precursors in a vapor phase are<br>
brought into contact with the hot substrate, optionally<br>
during cooling, in particular the atmosphere face of a<br>
float output glass.<br>
Cathode sputtering, known from patent WO 97/103 86,<br>
proves also to be particularly advantageous from the<br>
standpoint of industrial scale-up. This is a vacuum<br>
technique that makes it possible, in particular, for<br>
the thicknesses and the stoichiometry cf the deposited<br>
layers to be very finely adjusted. It is generally<br>
enhanced by a magnetic field for greater efficiency. It<br>
may be reactive sputtering, in which case it starts<br>
with an essentially metallic target, here based on<br>
titanium (optionally alloyed with another metal or with<br>
silicon), and the sputtering takes place in an<br>
oxidizing atmosphere, generally an Ar/O2 mixture. It<br>
may also be nonreactive sputtering, in which case it<br>
starts with a ceramic target already in the oxidized<br>
form of titanium (optionally alloyed). The titanium<br>
dioxide produced by cathode sputtering is generally-<br>
amorphous and poorly crystallized, and it has to be<br><br>
heated subsequently for it to crystallize in the<br>
photocatalytically active form.<br>
Application WO 02/24 971 discloses the deposition on<br>
glass of partially crystallized anatase titanium<br>
dioxide by cathode sputtering a: a relatively high<br>
working pressure of at least 2 Pa; in a first variant,<br>
during the deposition the substrate is for example at<br>
220-250ºC, a conventional annealing operation at about;<br>
400°C then being carried out if required; in a second<br>
variant, the deposition is carried out on the substrate<br>
at room temperature, and then the coated substrate is<br>
heated to 550°C at most, for a few hours.<br>
In the current state of knowledge, if particular<br>
properties requiring an annealing, bending, toughening<br>
or other heat treatment at above 600 °C, or even up to<br>
700°C in certain cases, are required for glazing coated<br>
with photocatalytic TiO2, the expert would inevitably<br>
deposit the TiO2 or its precursors after this neat<br>
treatment and would then activate or react the<br>
precursors by applying a more moderate temperature. En<br>
particular, it is considered that temperatures above<br>
600°C favor crystallization of TiO2 in the rutilo form,<br>
which is photocata ytically less active than the<br>
anatase form.<br>
Now, the inventors have succeeded in obtaining high<br>
photocatalytic activity and high optical quality by<br>
crystallizing the titanium dioxide at the temperatures<br>
of conventional glass heat treatments, thereby<br>
achieving this crystallization by the single toughening<br>
or other heat treatment and avoiding an additional<br>
subsequent heating operation at a more moderate<br>
temperature.<br>
For this purpose, the subject of the invention is a<br>
method of preparing a materia] exhibiting<br>
photocatalytic properties comprising at least partially<br><br>
crystallized titanium oxide, especially in anat.ase<br>
form, characterized in that it employs temperatures in<br>
excess of 600°C. As a result, there is better<br>
integration of this method into various industrial<br>
processes, which are simplified by the elimination of a<br>
specific crystallization operation at a relatively low<br>
temperature. The duration of these processes is<br>
correspondingly shortened thereby. There are fewer<br>
devices required, since the heating means accomplish<br>
two functions simultaneously. Finally the cost of these<br>
processes is reduced.<br>
According to preferred, embodiments and/or embodiments<br>
that particularly prompted the invention:<br>
the method employs temperatures in excess of<br>
630°C;<br>
it entails a toughening and/or bending<br>
treatment carried out on glazing {that is to say for<br>
example at temperatures possibly up to 700°C) .<br>
So as to provide excellent results in the illustrative<br>
examples below, the method of the invention comprises<br>
the deposition of a titanium oxide coating on a first<br>
face of a first transparent or semitransparent<br>
substrate of the glass or glass-ceramic type which,<br>
optionally, has been provided beforehand with one or<br>
more functional multilayers and/or functional layers,<br>
the nature of which will be described in detail later.<br>
According to other advantageous features of the method<br>
of the invention:<br>
- it comprises the deposition, on the second face<br>
of said first transparent or semitransparent substrate<br>
or on a second face belonging to a second transparent<br>
or semitransparent sujostrate, of one or more functional<br>
multilayers and/or functional layers, the nature of<br>
which will also be explained in detail belcw (the<br>
method of the invention therefore makes it possible to<br>
obtain transparent or semitransparent products<br><br>
exhibiting mechanical properties obtained by heat<br>
treatment at relatively high temperature, and may have<br>
the broadest range of combined functionalities);<br>
said employment, of temperatures in excess of<br>
600°C is after the deposition on said first and second<br>
faces (however, any other variant in which these<br>
temperatures are not applied after deposition on the<br>
second face is not excluded from thus invention, as long<br>
as these temperatures are applied after deposition on<br>
the first face; in other words, the coating product, on<br>
the second face cannot, be subjected to temperatures in<br>
excess of 600°C, for example by carrying out the<br>
deposition on the second face after use of these<br>
temperatures or, in the case in which the second face<br>
belongs to a second substrate, the latter can be<br>
associated with the first substrate - in double-glazing<br>
or laminated glazing - only after this has been<br>
subjected to these temperatures - combination of a<br>
first substrate made of tougnened glass with a second<br>
substrate made of nontoughened glass. Otherwise, again<br>
according to the invention, the products deposited on<br>
the first and second faces are heated simultaneously to<br>
more than 600°C, which may be advantageous and<br>
economical, the second substrate itself, if it exists,<br>
then also being thermally treated);<br>
- the deposition on said first and second faces<br>
is carried out by cathode sputtering and<br>
advantageously, in this case, in line and<br>
simultaneously or almost simultaneously, along a<br>
substantially identical direction and an opposite sense<br>
(especially intended is the use of a magnetically<br>
enhanced cathode sputtering installation of the type<br>
commonly called "sputter up and down", in which the<br>
first and second faces are horizontal and directed<br>
upward and downward respectively, so that they are<br>
contacted by sputtering cones of vertical average<br>
direction, downward in the case of TiO2 and upward in<br>
the case of the thermal-control multilayer,<br>
respectively). However, any other orientation of the<br><br>
The subject of the invention is also a glass sheet, at<br>
least one face of which bears a coating of a material<br>
comprising titanium oxide, characterized in that it is<br>
capable of undergoing or has undergone a heat treatment<br>
at above 600°C, such as a toughening and/or bending<br>
operation, while still preserving the photocatalytic<br>
activity and the optical quality that are required for<br>
antisoiling glazing.<br>
Firstly, the heat treatment at above 600°C does not<br>
affect the product to such an extent that it makes it<br>
unsuitable for use as antisoiling glazing; it has even<br>
been observed, not without surprise, that the photocatalytic<br>
activity is comparable, or even superior in<br>
certain cases, to that obtained after heat treatments<br>
according to the reaching of the abovement. i oned<br>
application WO 02/24971 (for example in annealing at<br>
500°C for one hour).<br>
Nor is the use of temperatures above 600°C incompatible<br>
with high optical quality, by which it is essentially<br>
meant that there are no defects visible to the eye:<br>
haze, spots or pitting, cracks. Advantageously, from an<br>
industrial standpoint, the mean colorimetric variation<br>
AE in reflection on the coating side induced by the<br>
heat treatment is at most 2.3, preferably at most. 2.3;<br>
this expresses the fact that the colorimetric response<br>
in reflection of the end product is close to that of<br>
the coating product: before heat treatment. AE is<br>
calculated by the equation:<br><br>
in which A expresses the change in a parameter induced<br>
by the heating: L, the lightness; a* and b*, the<br>
chromaticity coordinates (in the (L,a*,b*) colorimetry<br>
system, positive values of a* go toward red, negative<br><br>
values of a* go toward green, positive values of b* go<br>
toward yellow and negative values of b* go toward blue;<br>
the region of a* and b+ values close to 0 is achromatic).<br>
Other subjects of the invention consist of:<br>
single or multiple, laminated, monolithic<br>
glazing, which includes a glass sheet as described<br>
above;<br>
single or multiple, laminated, monolithic<br>
glazing, at least a first face of at least a first<br>
constituent glass sheet of which bears a coating cf a<br>
material exhibiting photocatalytic properties, obtained<br>
in accordance with the method of the invention.<br>
According to other preferred features of this glazing:<br>
beneath the coating of a material exhibiting<br>
photocatalytic properties, said first face bears one or<br>
more functional multilayers and/or functional layers,<br>
including at least, one layer forming a barrier to the<br>
migration of alkali metals from the glass liable to<br>
result from the application of temperatures in excess<br>
of 600°C (for this barrier layer, SiO2, Si3N4 and AIN<br>
deposited by magnetron sputtering, SiOC deposited by<br>
CVD, etc. are known; for other functionalities, the<br>
multilayers and layers provided below for said second<br>
face may be used, to the exclusion of hydrophilic and<br>
hydrophobic layers that are intended to be brought into<br>
contact with the atmosphere);<br>
the second face of said first glass sheet or a<br>
second face belonging to a second constituent glass<br>
sheet bears one or more functional multilayers and/or<br>
functional layers chosen from a thermal, control, such<br>
as solar-control, or low-emissivity multilayer, a<br>
multilayer or a layer with an optical functionality,<br>
such as antiref lect i on, light radiation filtration,<br>
coloration or scattering, a layer of an antisolling<br>
photocatalytic material especially of the type with<br>
high activity, a hydrophilic layer, a hydrophobic<br>
layer, a network of conductive threads or a conductive<br><br>
layer especially for heating, or an antenna or<br>
antistatic layer, these being taken individually or in<br>
combinat ion.<br>
Another subject of the invention is the application of<br>
this glazing as "self-cleaning", especially<br>
antifogging, anticondensation and antisoiling glazing,<br>
especially architectural glazing of the double-glazing<br>
type, vehicle glazing of the windshield, rear window,<br>
side window and wing mirror type for automobil.es,<br>
windows for trains, aircraft and ships, utilitarian<br>
glazing, such as aquarium glass, shop window glass and<br>
greenhouse glass, interior furnishings, urban furniture<br>
(bus shelters, billboards, etc.), mirrors, screens for<br>
display systems of the computer, television and<br>
telephone type, electrically controllable glazing, such<br>
as electrochromic glazing of the 1iquid-crystaL or<br>
electroluminescent type, or photovoltaic glazing.<br>
The invention is illustrated below by means of<br>
examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
In this example, the transformation of amorphos TiO2<br>
obtained by magnetron sputtering into its active form<br>
by, on the one hand, an industrial toughening operation<br>
and, on the other hand, an annealing operation for one<br>
hour at 500°C are compared.<br>
The photocatalytic activity after the two treatments<br>
was determined by means of the stearic acid photo-<br>
degradation/infrared transmission test or SAT for<br>
short, this test being described in application<br>
WO 00/75087.<br>
A 60 nm thick layer of SiOC was deposited on three<br>
specimens of 4 mm-thick clear soda-lime silicate glass<br>
by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) as described in<br><br>
application WO 01/32578, and a 100 nm thick SiO2 layer<br>
was deposited on three other specimens by magnetron<br>
sputtering.<br>
TiO2 coatings of varying thickness were deposited on<br>
the six specimens by magnetron sputtering at a working<br>
pressure of 26 • 10-3 mbar, and then the photocatalytic<br>
activity of the coatings was determined as indicated<br>
above after the two aforementioned heat treatments.<br>
The results are given in Table T below.<br><br>
Contrary to what was expected, not only does the<br>
industrial toughening operation not reduce the<br>
photocatalytic activity unacceptably, but the latter is<br>
at least comparable to that resulting from TiO2<br>
activation treatments known in the prior art, as<br>
represented in particular by WO 02/2497 1 already<br>
mentioned. En fact, the activity is no longer weak<br>
after toughening only in Trial 4.<br>
Consequently, the TiO2 prepared here could be toughened<br>
from the photocatalytic activity standpoint, even by<br>
employing standard thicknesses of sublayers acting as<br>
barriers to the diffusion of alkali metals from the<br>
glass.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
The above trials 1, 3 and 5, and also trials 7 and 8<br>
characterized by respective thicknesses of the<br>
photocatalytic coatinq obtained of 27 and 19 nm (with<br>
the same SiO2 barrier sublayer and the same TiO2<br>
formation conditions as in trials 1, 3 and 5), involved<br>
the measurement of the mean colorirnetric change AF in<br>
reflection on the coating sice induced by rhe<br>
industrial toughening operation. The meaning of the<br>
various parameters in the (L,a*,b*.) colorimetry system<br>
and the equation for calculating AE from L, a* and<br>
b* are as described above.<br>
The results are given in Table II below.<br><br>
The relatively small mean colorirnetric changes, or even<br>
in some cases ideally changes of less than 2, express a<br>
small color change in reflection on the photocataytic<br>
coating side after all the coating has undergone an<br>
industrial toughening operation. This avoids the<br>
undesirable production of toughened products that<br>
undergo an excessively large colorimetric change as a<br>
result of the toughening operation. It becomes easier<br>
to predict, from before the toughening operation, what<br>
the final color will be.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br><br>
This example relates to a double glazing unit<br>
consisting of two 4 mm thick glass sheets between which<br>
there is a 15 mm thick air cavity. In this example and<br>
the following ones, the face 2 of the double glazing<br>
unit, i.e. that face in contact with the air cavity of<br>
the glass sheet intended to be installed closest to the<br>
external atmosphere (and not that intended to be on the<br>
inside of a building), is coated with a thermal control<br>
multilayer deposited by magnetron sputtering. This<br>
process is particularly practical for depositing layers<br>
of the most varied type, by varying and precisely<br>
controlling the thicknesses thereof, on an industrial<br>
scale.<br>
Here, this multilayer was a Low-emissivity multilayer,<br>
that is to say one that reflects thermal infrared<br>
radiation (for wavelengths of the order of 10 μm) and<br>
capable of keeping heat inside a building for example.<br>
The combination of the thermal, control multilayer on<br>
face 2 with a multilayer that included a photocatalytic<br>
TiO2 layer and an SiO2 sublayer acting as barrier to the<br>
diffusion of alkali metals, deposited by magnetron<br>
sputtering on face 1, intended to be in contact with<br>
the external atmosphere, was studied from the optical<br>
standpoint.<br>
Hereafter, X and Y denote, respectively, the low-<br>
emissivity multilayers differing from that, of Example 2<br>
of application EP 0 718 250 A2 only by changing the<br>
thickness of the laye:r (2) to 2 5 nm, and layer (?) to<br>
19 nm and layer (3) to 2 9 nm, respectively.<br>
The following four gazing compositions defined below<br>
only by the glass sheet, on the outside, were tested:<br>
3a:4 mm glass/36 nm Si3N4/X;<br>
3b: 18 nm TiO2/150 nm SiO2/4 mm glass/X<br>
3c: 18 nm TiO2/75 nm SiO2/9 nm Si3N4/63 nm SiO2/4 mm<br>
glass/X;<br><br>
3d:(the same photocatalytic multilayer as in<br>
3b).../4 mm glass/Y.<br>
In this example and in Examples 4-7 below, all the<br>
multilayers were subjected to an industrial toughening<br>
operation. The optical characteristics of the glazing<br>
were determined in transmission and in reflection on<br>
the "interior" side of the building (i.e. face 4 of the<br>
double glazing unit, of which only faces 1 and 2 were<br>
functionalized as indicated above), in reflection on<br>
the "exterior" side cf the building (face 1: glass or<br>
TiO2) (the light transmission and hight reflection T,,<br>
and Rr. in percent, chomaticity coordinates a* and b*<br>
in transmission and in reflection on both faces or the<br>
glazing, as mentioned above). The results are given in<br>
the following tables.<br><br><br><br>
Comparison between glazing 3a and glazing 3b indicates<br>
in what way the addition of the photocatalytic coating<br>
is liable to disturb the optical properties of the<br>
glazing: thus, a reduction in TL, a substantial<br>
increase in RL on both faces, and an increase in<br>
chromaticity in reflection on both faces of the glazing<br>
toward the blue-green (negative a* and b* values) are<br>
observed.<br>
Compared with glazing 3b, in glazing 3c some of the<br>
lost TL, is recovered and the two R. values again<br>
advantageously approach those of glazing 3a, as do its<br>
colorimetric values in reflection.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
The methodology of Example 3 was ac.opted for the<br>
following glazing (the multilayers on face 2 reflect<br>
the solar radiation, corresponding to average<br>
wavelengths of the order of 1 μm) . In this example, X<br>
and Y denote, respectively, the solar-prote:.:tion<br>
multilayer sold by Saint-Gobain Glass France under the<br>
registered trade mark SGG Coollite ST®108 and the<br>
multilayer obtained by increasing the outermost. layer<br>
thicknesses of the latter by 3.7, on the proximal side<br>
of the glass substrate, and by 2/3 on the distal side,<br>
respect ively:<br>
4a:6 mm glass/X;<br>
4b: 18 mm TiO2/150 nm SiO2/6 mm glass/X;<br>
4c: 18 nm TiO2/50 mm SiO2/12 nm Si3N4/71 nm SiO2/6 mm<br>
glass/X;<br>
4d:the same photocatalytic multilayer as in 4b/6<br>
mm glass/Y.<br><br>
In this examp]e and the following ones, the glazing<br>
units were composed of two 6 mm thick glass sheets<br>
between which there was a 12 mm thick air cavity.<br>
The results are given in the three tables below.<br><br>
Here, the TL is little affected by the addition of TiO; ,<br>
which also provides a slight redaction in yellow in<br>
reflection on the TiO? ; 4b)/glass(4a) exterior side.<br>
The modification of the solar-protection multilayer<br>
(4d) results in an Increase in TL and a substantial<br>
reduction in R1 on the interior side, accompanied by a<br>
slight increase in yellow in reflection.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Example 4 was repeated, X and Y denoting here,<br>
respectively, the solar-protection multilayer sold by<br>
Saint-Gobain Glass France under one registered trade<br>
mark SGG Coollite ST®120 and the multilayer differ ing<br>
from the latter only by increasing the thickness of the<br>
proximal layer of the glass substrate by a factor of 2:<br>
5a:6 mm glass/X;<br>
5b: 18 nm TiO2/15C nm SiO2/6 mm glass/X;<br>
5c: 18 nm TiO2/68 nm SiO2/10 nm Si3N4/69 nm SiO2/6 mm<br>
glass/X;<br>
5d:idem 5b/6 mm glass/Y.<br><br><br>
5c in relation to 5b shows, compared with 5a, a partial<br>
recovery of the lost TL and of the two RL values and,<br>
notably, a complete recovery of the color in reflection<br>
on both sides, even with a slightly better coloration<br>
neutrality.<br>
In 5d, the recovered TL, is increased, the reflection on<br>
the interior side is slightly higher (less good)<br>
whereas the reflection on the exterior side (TiO2) is<br>
reduced to an even lower (better) level than the R1 of<br>
5a on the exterior (glass) side.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
The previous example was repeated for the following<br>
glazing units, in which X and Y denote, respectively<br>
the solar-protection multi layer sold by Saint-Cobain<br>
Glass France under the registered trade mark SGG<br>
Coollite ST®136 and the multilayer differing from the<br>
latter only by the thickness of the proximal and distal<br>
layers of the glass substrate increased by a factor of<br>
1.7 and 0.774, respectively:<br>
6a:6 mm glass/X;<br>
6b:18nm TiO2/150nm SiO2/6mm verre/X;<br>
6c: 18 ran TiO2/66 nm SiO2/10 nm Si3N4/57 nm SiO2/6 mm<br>
glass/X;<br>
6d:the same photocatalytic multilayer as in<br>
6b/6 mm glass/Y.<br><br><br><br>
The comparison between 6a and 6b is characterized by an<br>
increase in RL on the exterior side of t.ne glazing and,<br>
to a lesser extent, by an increase in chromaticity of<br>
the second relative to the first.<br>
By optimizing the photocatalytic multilayer 6c, some of<br>
the lost TL, is recovered and the RL on the exterior side<br>
is again substantially reduced, while recovering the<br>
color in reflection on the same face (with even a more<br>
neutral colorimetric response than 6a).<br>
By modifying the solar-protection multilayer 6d, the R1,<br>
on the exterior (TiO2) side is lowered to an even lower<br>
level than that of 6a on the glass side, and the yellow<br>
component in reflection on the inferior side of the<br>
glazing is reduced relative to that of the other three<br>
glazing units.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
The previous example was repeated with the following<br>
glazing units, in which X and Y denote, respectively,<br>
the solar-protection multilayer sold by Saint-Gobain<br><br>
Glass France under the registered trade mark SGG<br>
Coollite STO150 and the multilayer differing from the<br>
latter only by the elimination of the proximal layer of<br>
the glass substrate and by increasing the thickness of<br>
the intermediate la/er by a factor of 1.5 and the<br>
distal layer by a factor of 0.68:<br>
7a:6 mm glass/X;<br>
7b: 18 nm TiO2/15:) nm SiO2/6 mm glass/X;<br>
7c: 18 nm TiO2/64 nm SiO2/13 nm Si3N4/50 nm SiO2/6 mm<br>
glass/X;<br>
7d:the same photocatalytic multilayer as _n 7b/6<br>
mm glass/Y.<br><br><br>
These show in particular the near recovery of color in<br>
reflection on the exterior side of 7c in relation to<br>
that of 7a.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
This example relates to what is called a "four seasons"<br>
multilayer, providing both solar -protection and low<br>
emissivity, sold by Saint-Gobain Glass France under the<br>
registered trade mark Planistar®. Unlike the thermal<br>
control multilayers of the previous examples, but<br>
similar to those of the following examples the latter<br>
is not subjected to the industrial toughening<br>
operation, which is therefore carried out, if required,<br>
before the multilayer is deposited, on the glass sheet<br>
optionally provided with its TiO2 coating and the<br>
barrier sublayer.<br>
The following glazing was tested:<br>
8a:6 mm glass/Planistar®;<br>
8b:18 nm TiO2/150 nm SiO2/6 mm glass/Planistar®;<br>
8c: 18 nm TiO2/68 nm SiO2/8 nm Si3N4/58 nm SiO2/6 mm<br>
glass/Planistar® .<br><br><br><br>
Glazing 8c, compared with 8b, restores the color, in<br>
reflection on the interior side, of 8a and also, on the<br>
exterior side, where the reduction in R0 compared with<br>
8b is moreover slightly more significant.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
The thermal control multilayer was a solar-protection<br>
multilayer sold by Saint-Gobain Glass France under the<br>
registered trade mark. SKN®154. The following glazing<br>
was tested:<br>
9a:6 mm glass/SKN®154;<br>
9b: 18 nm TiO2/150 nm SiO2/6 mm glass ;i dem 9a;<br>
9c: 18 nm TiO2/68 nm SiO2/8 nm Si3N4/58 nm SiO2/6 mm<br>
glass/idem 9a.<br><br><br><br>
Here it is particularly manifest, on the exterior side,<br>
that for 9c an RL intermediate of that of the other two<br>
coated glasses is obtained and also a blue component of<br>
the color in reflection that is almost the same level<br>
as in the absence of TiO2 (9a) .<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
The multilayer SKN®165B, again sold by the Applicant,<br>
was tested, and more particularly the following<br>
glazing:<br>
10a:6 mm glass/SKN®165B;<br>
10b: 18 nm TiO2/150 nm SiO2/6 mm glass idem 10a;<br>
10c: 18 nm TiO2/69 nm SiO2/9 nm Si3N4/49 nm SiO2/6 mm<br>
glass/...idem 10a.<br><br><br><br>
A 50 nm thick SiOC layer acting as barrier to the<br>
migration of alkali metals and covered with a 15 nm<br>
thick photocatalytic TiO2 layer was formed by a CVD<br>
process on a glass sheet, reproducing Example 5 of<br>
patent EP 0 850 204 BI.<br>
The photocatalytic activity, determined by<br>
photodegradation of stearic acid followed by intrared<br>
transmission, as previously, was 9 • 10-3 cm-1min-1 and,<br>
after industrial toughening, 7 10 3 cm-1min-1. This<br>
corresponds with the functionality being largely and<br>
satisfactorily retained.<br>
The invention therefore makes it possible to produce<br>
glazing with antisoiling photocatalytic coatings that<br>
can be toughened and are of high activity, under the<br>
optimum industrial conditions, with light transmission<br>
and reflection levels and colorimetric characteristics<br>
in transmission and in reflection that can be readily<br>
adjusted to the values desired by the user.<br><br>
