 UV RADIATION SYSTEM HAVING MATERIALS FOR SELECTIVELY<br>
	ATTENUATING RADIATION	 <br>
This invention claims the benefit of earlier filed provisional application US<br>
Serial No. 60/143,607 filed July 13, 1999 having the same title, and further this application is a continuation in part of US Serial No. 09/259,758 (VTN0388) titled "Method of Sterilization" filed March 1, 1999. Both aforementioned<br>
applications are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention is directed to a UV radiation system having a material for<br>
increasing the ratio of desirable radiation to undesirable radiation to a target<br>
provided by a radiation source.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In the field of UV sterilization or disinfection, the typical target media is a<br>
durable (non-absorbing, non-degenerating) material such as metal, ceramic or<br>
chemically simple solutions like water or saline, and the energies involved are<br>
typically low, that is, less than 0.1 J/cm2 per pulse total radiation or 20<br>
Watts/cm2 for a continuous radiation source.<br>
The use of a high energy broad spectrum radiation source to inactivate<br>
microorganisms has been disclosed in the prior art. US Patents 5,768,853;<br>
5,786,598; 5,034,235; 4,871,559; and 5,900,211; and WO96/09775 have disclosed the use of a broad spectrum radiation source to inactivate<br>
microorganisms on food, water and medical devices. For the applications of<br>
the broad spectrum radiation source, damage to the exposed articles, such as<br>
the food, water, and medical devices by the radiation has not been considered.<br>
US Patents 5,768,853 and 5,900,211 suggest that the cooling fluid around the<br>
flash lamps can be replaced with a liquid for cooling and/or spectral filtering by<br>
the use of selected liquid solutions with desired spectral<br>
transmittance/absorbance characteristics. No materials other than water are<br>
suggested for the spectral filtering liquid, nor is there any discussion of which<br>
ranges to filter and/or for what purpose. US Patent 5,768,853 discloses that<br><br>
the outer safety glass of one of the described embodiments does filter out<br>
wavelengths shorter than 200 nanometers (nm) to prevent the formation of<br>
ozone outside the outer safety glass, although the composition of the glass is<br>
not disclosed.<br>
WO 97/33629 discloses a method of sterilization and purification of<br>
biological sera and other contaminated fluids through the deactivation of<br>
pathogens by exposing them to a precise spectra of UV radiation. The<br>
precisely controlled spectra of radiation is specific to the molecular make-up of<br>
the pathogens to kill them, but leaves the surrounding cells, proteins, and other<br>
components intact. The biological sera are irradiated with UV radiation from<br>
about 200nm to about 250nm. The specific wavelengths that provide optimal<br>
kill of each virus, bacteria or other microorganism is determined within a narrow<br>
range of from 3.0 to about 10.0nm, preferably 3 to 5nm. A<br>
transmitter/regulator, grating or other optical filter can be used to control the<br>
wavelength size and variation, but there are no specific examples described.<br>
The exposure cell window where the sera is placed is made of quartz, sapphire<br>
or UV grad fused quartz silica and can be coated with a transmission material<br>
such as polytetrafluorocarbon which allows the UV radiation wavelength to<br>
pass through unadulterated. Teflon may also be used as a UV transparent<br>
disposable lining.<br>
EPO 0277505 B1 discloses a UV radiation lamp, which is used for<br>
sterilizing bottles. The lamp has a reflector, referred to in the patent as a mirror<br>
which has a dielectric coating. The dielectric coating (dichroic or interference-<br>
filter) is used to achieve selective reflection of UV radiation. The reflector can<br>
be coated with several tens of dielectric layers each having a thickness of a<br>
quarter of the wavelength of the radiation. Suitable materials for the dielectric<br>
coating include AL2O3/NaF, Sc2O3/MgF2, ThF4/Na2AlF6, HfO2/SiO2, and<br>
PbF2/Na3AIF6. Dielectric coatings are suitable for low energy absorption of UV<br>
radiation, but will not survive the demands of a high energy system, and will<br>
have short effective lifetimes in a high energy system. Further, dielectric filters<br>
are extremely angle sensitive, so they will not be effective for a shaped<br>
reflector, which changes the angle of incidence at the filter.<br><br>
Lamp manufacturers often add dopants to the lamp envelope in a lamp<br>
to extend the life of the lamp. Depending on the lamp and what it is to be used<br>
for, some dopants are selected to cut off UV radiation entirely, e.g. cerium<br>
oxide in the lamp envelope of flash lamps used in laser applications. Other<br>
dopants are selected to cut off that portion of the UV radiation less than 180nm<br>
which creates ozone. Lamps having these dopants are called "ozone-free<br>
bulbs." Other dopants are added to the lamp envelope to strengthen the lamp<br>
envelope against thermal shock.<br>
For the application of high energy UV radiation to a polymeric medical<br>
device, the inventors have determined that damage to the medical device due<br>
to the radiation exposure must be considered, because it may render the<br>
exposed medical device useless for its intended purpose. There is a need for<br>
materials and ways to incorporate the materials into the lamp system to<br>
attenuate the undesirable portion of the UV radiation which is damaging to the<br>
polymeric medical device without reducing or significantly reducing the desired<br>
portion of the UV radiation, e.g. germicidal effective radiation.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
This invention provides a high energy radiation system which produces<br>
UV radiation comprising a selectively attenuating material which increases the<br>
ratio of desired to undesired radiation to reduce the radiation damage to a<br>
target by selectively attenuating at least 30 percent of the radiation from 180 up<br>
to 240nm which impinges upon said attenuating material, and directs greater *<br>
than 50 percent of the radiation from 240nm and 280nm which impinges upon<br>
said attenuating material.<br>
The radiation system comprising attenuating materials which selectively<br>
attenuate the radiation make it possible to expose to high energy UV radiation<br>
targets which are sensitive to UV radiation from 180nm up to 240nm. These<br>
high energy UV radiation systems produce radiation, which is undesired and<br>
desired. Without attenuation, the undesired UV radiation damages the<br>
materials of or changes the characteristics of a target at the same time the<br>
desired UV radiation is delivered. The target can be any material which<br>
comprises UV-sensitive composition(s). Damage to the target includes color<br><br>
changes of organic or inorganic dyes, chain scissions or alteration of the<br>
mechanical properties of polymers or other organic materials, or causing<br>
oxidation of organic materials. By selectively attenuating the undesired<br>
radiation, it is possible to use a high energy UV radiation system on products<br>
including organic products and inorganic products which would otherwise be<br>
damaged by the radiation, or to treat a broader class of materials, some of<br>
which have a low threshold for damage when subjected to the undesired<br>
radiation. This invention also simplifies the process control for the radiation<br>
systems used to expose UV-sensitive targets, because the amount of<br>
undesired radiation delivered after attenuation can be tailored to be below or<br>
much below the threshold for damage to the target, which will give more<br>
leeway in the amount of radiation which can be delivered. In the preferred<br>
embodiments, this invention is used to treat polymeric contact lenses in<br>
solution in polymeric packaging. The UV radiation damages the contact lens<br>
polymers, container polymers and solution additives. The invention will be<br>
described in reference to polymeric target materials; however, it is understood<br>
that additional UV-sensitive target materials could be treated by the method of<br>
this invention. One important application for this invention is in a lamp system<br>
for lasers wherein the target material is the laser medium, e.g. laser dyes, or<br>
other organic medium, which is sensitive to UV radiation.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The radiation system of this invention comprises a high energy UV<br>
radiation source. UV radiation sources that can be used in the radiation<br>
system include discrete or continuous producing, incoherent lamps, such as<br>
flash lamps, arc lamps (continuous or non-continuous), deuterium lamps, or<br>
continuous wave light sources, e.g. xenon gas or mercury vapor light sources.<br>
The UV radiation sources are high energy, that is, they generate greater than<br>
0.1 J/cm2 per pulse for a flash lamp or 20 watts/cm2for a continuous radiation<br>
source, preferably of which at least 1 percent of the radiation is from 240 to<br>
280nm. The presently preferred UV radiation source is a flash lamp which<br>
produces at least 1 J/cm2 broad spectrum radiation (200 - 3000nm) per flash of<br>
which at least 10 mJ/cm2 per flash is UV radiation. The preferred application is<br>
sterilization, in particular sterilization of contact lenses (target). For sterilization,<br>
the desired radiation is the germicidal radiation which includes the radiation<br>
from 240 to 280nm; with many references indicating that 254nm is the peak of<br>
the germicidal range; however, destruction to the contact lens polymer occurs<br>
upon exposure to the radiation below 320nm to about 10Onm (non-ionizing UV<br>
radiation). US Serial No. 09/259,758, titled "Method of Sterilization", VTN-<br>
0388, earlier incorporated by reference, discloses that radiation at wavelengths<br>
less than 320nm are absorbed by the contact lens polymers and may cause<br>
chain scissions within the polymers. The most destructive radiation is from<br>
180nm up to 240nm. (The term "up to" when used to describe a range means<br>
that the endpoint is not included within the range specified.) To prevent the<br>
destruction to polymers of the target, e.g. container or medical device by chain<br>
scissions or other mechanisms due to the UV radiation, this invention provides<br>
attenuating materials and ways of incorporating the attenuating materials into<br>
the radiation system to attenuate the undesirable wavelengths from at least a<br><br>
portion of the destructive radiation dose before the radiation reaches the target.<br>
U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/259,758, further discloses that the energy<br>
of the radiation (240 to 280nm) to the microorganism has to be at least 18<br>
mJ/cm2 for sterilization.<br>
To protect the polymeric target, it is preferred to attenuate the radiation<br>
or a portion of the radiation from 180nm up to 240nm; or at least greater than<br>
200nm up to 240nm. However, for some applications it may be more<br>
preferable to attenuate the radiation or a portion of the radiation from 180nm<br>
up to 250nm. To attenuate the undesired radiation to protect the polymeric<br>
target from damage and to prevent the formation of ozone, it is beneficial to<br>
attenuate the undesired radiation from 100nm up to 240nm. Ideally 100<br>
percent of the total radiation at the undesired wavelengths would be<br>
attenuated; however, even small percentages of attenuation of ranges of<br>
wavelengths of the undesired radiation are beneficial, because the attenuation<br>
increases the ratio of the desired (e.g. germicidally-effective) radiation to the<br>
undesired (e.g. damaging) radiation reaching the target, e.g. polymer,<br>
container and/or product. Increasing the ratio of germicidally-effective radiation<br>
to damaging radiation makes it possible to increase the overall radiation dose,<br>
if necessary for sterility, and makes it easier to control the system when the<br>
threshold of damage to the polymer is far below the dose for sterility.<br>
It is preferred that the attenuating materials of this invention provide<br>
greater than a 30 percent reduction in the total undesired radiation, more<br>
preferably greater than a 60 percent reduction, and most preferably greater than a 90 percent reduction in the total undesired radiation which impinges<br>
upon the attenuating materials. For the preferred embodiments, the undesired<br>
radiation is from 100nm up to 240nm, or at least from 180nm up to 240nm, or<br>
at least greater than 200nm up to 240nm. It is preferred to attenuate at least a<br>
portion of all the wavelengths of radiation specified in the specified ranges.<br>
Typically, the attenuating materials will not attenuate all the wavelengths in a<br>
given range at a single percentage, so certain attenuating materials will be<br>
better suited for some applications than others, or mixtures of the attenuating<br>
materials can be used to achieve improved reductions at certain or all of the<br>
wavelengths in the range of undesired wavelengths. An example of a mixture<br><br>
is chloroform and absolute ethanol. It is preferred that the attenuating<br>
materials attenuate the undesired radiation, and that the attenuating materials<br>
direct the desired radiation toward the target. The attenuating materials can<br>
direct the desired radiation toward the target by transmitting and/or reflecting<br>
the desired radiation from the radiation source which impinges upon the<br>
attenuating material, and/or by re-emitting absorbed undesired radiation as<br>
radiation within the desired radiation. The attenuating materials can direct the<br>
desired radiation towards the target either directly or indirectly, that is, the<br>
desired radiation may impinge upon other apparatus before striking the target,<br>
e.g. reflectors, mirrors, fiber optics, or the like. Preferably the attenuating<br>
materials direct greater than 50 percent of the desired radiation, more<br>
preferably greater than 75 percent and most preferably greater than 90 percent<br>
of the desired radiation, which impinges upon the attenuating materials. For<br>
sterilization the desired radiation is 240 to 280nm. (Whether the attenuating<br>
materials direct, e.g., transmit, reflect and/or re-emit, the desired radiation to<br>
the target can determine where the attenuating materials are positioned with<br>
respect to the radiation source and target.) Preferably, at least a portion of all<br>
the wavelengths of the undesired radiation in the ranges specified is<br>
transmitted, reflected or emitted by the attenuating materials. The preferred<br>
materials are those that attenuate greater than 30 percent of the undesired<br>
radiation and direct greater than 50 percent of the desired radiation. The more<br>
preferred attenuating materials attenuate greater than 50 percent of the total<br>
radiation from 100 up to 240nm and direct greater than 90 percent of the total<br>
radiation from 240 to 280nm which impinges upon the attenuating materials<br>
whereby at least some portion of the radiation between 200 up to 240nm is<br>
attenuated, preferably greater than 30%, more preferably greater than 60%,<br>
most preferably greater than 90% of the radiation between 200 up to 240nm is<br>
attenuated. Preferably, at least a portion of all the wavelengths of the<br>
undesired radiation in the ranges specified is attenuated, and at least a portion<br>
of all the wavelengths of the desired radiation in the ranges specified is<br>
directed.<br>
The attenuation materials preferably provide an attenuation ratio greater<br>
than 1.2, more preferably greater than 1.8, most preferably greater than 2.5.<br><br>
The attenuation ratio is defined as the percent of the desired radiation directed<br>
by the attenuation materials divided by the percent of the undesired radiation<br>
absorbed by the attenuation materials. For example, the attenuation ratio of a<br>
reflector of lanthanum oxide would have an attenuation ratio of 3 (see Table 1).<br>
Attenuating materials can be liquids, solids, or gases. An example of an<br>
attenuating material which is a gas is ozone, e.g. 10 ppm ozone in air. Liquid<br>
attenuating materials include polyols, such as alkyl alcohols, more preferably<br>
propylene glycols having a weight average molecular weight from 200 to 1,000,<br>
and most preferably propylene glycols having a weight average molecular<br>
weight of 200. Examples of polyethylene glycols include PEG 200, PEG 400,<br>
PEG 600, from Aldrich Chemical Co. Other useful liquid attenuating materials<br>
are halogenated carbon compounds, such as, fluorocarbons, chlorocarbons,<br>
chloroform, more preferably fully halogenated carbon compounds, because<br>
they are more stable, such as, freon, except for fluorinerts which are also more<br>
preferred although not fully halogenated. Examples of fluorinerts include FC-<br>
40, FC-43, FC-70, commercially available from 3M, available from Aldrich<br>
Chemical Company. The preferred fluorinerts have nitrogen within their<br>
compositions. Other liquid attenuating materials include organic carbonates,<br>
more preferably aliphatic carbonates, such as propylene carbonates. Other<br>
useful liquid attenuating materials include silicon compounds, such as sodium<br>
silicate, more preferably polysiloxane compounds such as<br>
polydimethylsiloxanes, most preferably hydride-terminated silicone oil.<br>
Mixtures of the above-described liquids can be used as the liquid attenuating-<br>
materials. The preferred mixtures are those of halogenated carbon<br>
compounds and organic carbonates, more preferably chloroform and propylene<br>
carbonate. Ways to incorporate the liquid attenuating materials into the<br>
radiation system to attenuate radiation will be described below. Typically the<br>
liquid attenuating materials will need to be pumped through or around the<br>
radiation source or target of the radiation; therefore, it is preferred that the<br>
liquid attenuating materials have a viscosity from 1 to 1,000 cps, more<br>
preferably from 1 to 500 cps and most preferably from 1 to 100 cps. The<br>
easiest liquid attenuating materials to pump have a viscosity of from 1 to 10<br>
cps. The liquid attenuating materials can be used in a suitable liquid carrier;<br><br>
preferably a non-ionic liquid, or they can comprise a solid attenuating material<br>
in a suitable liquid carrier to form a dispersion or colloid with the solid, for<br>
example 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA) or ethylene glycol dimethacrylate<br>
(EDGMA) in water.<br>
Examples of liquids which can be used as attenuating materials are<br>
shown in Figure 1. The curves in Figure 1 were generated by placing cuvettes<br>
having a 10 mm pathlength filled with the sample liquids into a<br>
spectrophotometer, and recording the light which passed through the samples.<br>
Liquid attenuating materials can be used in various locations to<br>
attenuate selected radiation. A first set of embodiments using liquid<br>
attenuating materials will be described in reference to Fig. 2. Fig. 2 shows a<br>
cross-section of a conventional flash lamp 10; although it is understood that<br>
other radiation sources described earlier can be used in the radiation system of<br>
this invention, such as arc lamps (continuous or non-continuous), deuterium<br>
lamps, or any other source which produces at least a portion of the radiation<br>
from 180 up to 240nm or greater than 200 up to 240nm, and at least a portion<br>
of the radiation from 240 to 280nm, and most preferably in a continuum<br>
between 100 and 400nm. The flash lamp 10 consists of a lamp 11 which<br>
consists of two electrodes (not shown) each connected to the end of a hollow<br>
lamp envelope 12. The lamp envelope 12 is made out of a strong transparent<br>
material which can withstand high temperatures and thermal shock such as<br>
glass, quartz or sapphire or the like. The lamp generates radiation when an<br>
arc is created between the electrical connectors. The lamp envelope 12 may-<br>
be inside a flow tube 13 as shown. The flow tube 13 provides protection for<br>
the lamp envelope 12. Typically cooling water is pumped in the passageway<br>
16 formed between the lamp envelope 12 and the flow tube 13 to dissipate the<br>
heat generated by the lamp 11. In one embodiment of the invention one or<br>
more liquid attenuating materials can be used in place of the cooling water in<br>
the passageway 16 between the flow tube 13 and the lamp envelope 12 to<br>
both attenuate selected wavelengths and to cool the lamp 11. In this<br>
embodiment the attenuating materials can be pumped in the passageway 16<br>
between the lamp envelope 12 and the flow tube 13. Attenuating materials<br>
pumped between the lamp envelope and the flow tube must be highly resistive,<br><br>
preferably greater than 1 megohm, more preferably greater than 10 megohms,<br>
most preferably greater than 18 megohms, because of the potential of a short<br>
circuit within the lamp.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is shown in Fig. 2. The flash lamp<br>
10, in Fig. 3 is similar to the flash lamp shown in Fig. 2 and consists of a<br>
reflector 14, and a protective window 15 (similar elements are labeled with the<br>
same number in the figures). Passageways 28 and 29 may be added adjacent<br>
to the reflector 14 or the protective window 15 through which liquid attenuating<br>
materials may be added or pumped and used to attenuate selected<br>
wavelengths of the radiation. The passageways may be constructed of glass,<br>
quartz, sapphire or the like. Both passageways 28, 29 are shown in Fig. 3, but<br>
in alternative embodiments each passageway 28 or 29 may be used alone to<br>
hold an attenuating material to attenuate the undesired radiation.<br>
The sensitivity of the liquid attenuating materials to the radiation will<br>
determine the exposure amounts of the liquid attenuating materials to the<br>
radiation. If the liquid attenuating materials' ability to absorb or otherwise<br>
attenuate the radiation breaks down significantly after one exposure to the<br>
radiation, then those liquid attenuating materials can be continuously pumped<br>
through the passageways, exposed only once to the radiation, and then<br>
discarded. If the sensitivity to the radiation is less, then the liquid attenuating<br>
materials can be exposed to several flashes and then discarded, or exposed<br>
once to the radiation and mixed with a reservoir of the liquid attenuating<br>
material from which additional liquid attenuating material can be drawn and exposed, and this process can be repeated for an amount of time until it is<br>
determined that the ability of the liquid attenuating material in the reservoir to<br>
attenuate the radiation has been reduced to a point that the reservoir should be<br>
discarded and replaced with a fresh supply of liquid attenuating material. The<br>
attenuation ability of the liquid attenuating materials can be monitored using a<br>
spectrophotometer. The composition of the passageways in which the liquid<br>
attenuating materials are held and the individual liquid attenuating material's<br>
ability to attenuate the undesired radiation will be factors to consider when<br>
determining the thickness of the passageways (wavelength pathlength) which<br>
hold the liquid attenuating materials.<br><br>
Solid attenuating materials include, but are not limited to, alkaline metal<br>
compounds (oxides and halides), heavy metal oxides (e.g. barium), divalent<br>
metal oxides (e.g. magnesium), and polyvalent metal oxides (e.g. ytterbium or<br>
aluminum). Solid attenuating materials can also be selected according to the<br>
following formula MaObXcHd wherein M is a single metal or a mix of metals,<br>
preferably a rare earth metal, O is oxygen, X is a heteroatom such as sulfur,<br>
nitrogen and phosphorous or the like, and H is a halide, preferably fluorine, a is<br>
1 to 20, preferably 1 to 12, b is 0 to 20, preferably 0 to 12, c is 0 to 20,<br>
preferably 0 to 12, and d is 0 to 20, preferably 0 to 12, with the proviso that at<br>
least b, c or d is at least 1. These materials need to be of sufficient purity such<br>
that the levels of impurities do not degrade the reflector performance.<br>
Preferably the materials are more than 99.9 % pure, more preferably more than<br>
99.99 % pure. Examples of useful solid materials are listed in Table 1.<br>
Included in Table 1 are the mean percent reflectivities of the solid attenuating<br>
materials. The percent reflectivities were determined by packing a dry powder<br>
sample of solid material into a cuvette, and putting the cuvette into a<br>
spectrophotometer having an integrating sphere which measured the radiation<br>
reflected from the sample.<br><br><br>
In the formula for the solid attenuating materials, when a is 1 to 6 and b<br>
is 1 to 11, and c and d are 0 then the solid attenuating material is a metal<br>
oxide, such as calcium oxide (CaO) and hafnium oxide (HfO2), lanthanum<br>
oxide(La2O3), iron oxide (Fe3O4), terbium oxide (Tb4O7), praseodymium oxide<br>
(Pr6O11), and barium titanate (BaTiO3). An example of solid attenuating<br>
material for which a is 1, d is 2 and b and c are 0 is magnesium fluoride (MgF2).<br>
Additional examples of solid attenuating materials include magnesium oxide<br>
(MgO), aluminum oxide (Al2O3) barium oxide (BaO), barium titanate (BaTiO3),<br>
holmium oxide (Ho2O3), calcium oxide (CaO), lanthanum oxide (La2O3),<br>
germanium oxide (GeO2), tellurium oxide (TeO2), europium oxide (Eu2O3),<br>
erbium oxide (Er2O3), neodymium oxide (Nd2O3), samarium oxide (Srn2O3),<br>
ytterbium oxide (Yb2O3), yttrium oxide (Y2O3), and dysprosium oxide (Dy2O3).<br><br>
Other examples include refractory oxides of other rare earths, rare earth<br>
halides, and metallic combination oxides. The preferred attenuating materials<br>
are magnesium oxide, erbium oxide, holmium oxide, samarium oxide, tellurium<br>
oxide, lanthanum oxide, yttrium oxide, and ytterbium oxide, and the most<br>
preferred are lanthanum oxide, yttrium oxide, and ytterbium oxide.<br>
The solid attenuating materials can be incorporated into the radiation<br>
source (e.g. a lamp envelope, protective window or flow tube) which prevents<br>
the damaging radiation from reaching the target, e.g. polymer, product and/or<br>
packaging, to be exposed. As stated earlier, examples of a radiation source<br>
include a pulsed light source (e.g. xenon gas) or a continuous wave light<br>
source (e.g. mercury vapor). The solid attenuating materials can be added to<br>
the feed stock used to make the glass (e.g. sapphire, quartz, glass, crystalline<br>
materials, and the like), as what is commonly referred to in the glass industry<br>
as a dopant, during the manufacture of the lamp envelope and/or the flow tube<br>
and/or protective window. Additionally, the proper selection of dopants for the<br>
flow tube or the lamp envelope can increase the performance of the lamp by<br>
reducing thermal shock, solarization, fluorescence, phosphorescence, and/or<br>
can be used to reduce the undesirable radiation by absorption, or absorption<br>
and re-emission at desired or at least not undesired wavelengths. Attenuating<br>
materials which can absorb radiation at undesired wavelengths and re-emit at<br>
desired wavelengths are preferred.<br>
The attenuating materials can also be used to form a filter through which<br>
the radiation will pass prior to impinging upon the target which will attenuate the undesirable wavelengths before they contact the target, or the attenuating<br>
materials can be added to the packaging material. These embodiments will be<br>
described in more detail below.<br>
To approximate the amount of dopant to add to the glass, quartz or<br>
sapphire flow tube, lamp envelope or protective window or for the formation of<br>
a filter or the packaging material through which the radiation will pass prior to<br>
impinging upon the polymeric target, and for other embodiments described<br>
below, the Beer-Lambert equation quantifies the radiation absorption by a<br>
particular dopant or attenuating material:<br><br><br>
where l(λ) is the intensity of the attenuated radiation as a function of<br>
wavelength (λ), \0(λ) is the initial radiation intensity as a function of wavelength,<br>
α(λ) is the molar absorptivity of the dopant (attenuation material) as a function<br>
of wavelength, c is the concentration of the dopant, and x is the path length<br>
(thickness of the material in which the dopant is present) through which the<br>
radiation passes. α(λ) can be determined spectrophotometrically as described<br>
for generating the data in Table 2 or in a like way.<br>
An alternative embodiment of the invention is to add the solid<br>
attenuating materials to other parts of the radiation source, e.g. as part of a<br>
reflector as described in reference to Figs. 4 and 5. In Figure 4 is shown a<br>
cross-section of a flash lamp 10 similar to that shown in Fig. 2 (similar elements<br>
are labeled with the same number). Figure 4 shows an attenuating coating 36<br>
as part of the reflector 14. The reflector 14 also consists of a reflector support<br>
35. The attenuating coating 36 comprises an attenuating material. The<br>
attenuating coatings can be applied by painting, spraying, plasma coating,<br>
dipping, casting, conversion coating, gel coating, etching, chemical vapor<br>
depositing, sputtering, or chemical or mechanical bonding, e.g. by adhesives of<br>
a film comprising the attenuating materials to a reflector support 35. The<br>
preferred method of applying the attenuating coatings is to paint or spray<br>
attenuating materials onto a reflector support. To paint or spray them onto the<br>
support 35, an aqueous or non-aqueous suspension is formed preferably<br>
comprising attenuating material and binder. Useful binders are polymeric,<br>
inorganic or sol-gels, more preferably inorganic or sol gel, and most preferably<br>
inorganic. The preferred suspension comprises 0.1 to 50 % binder, 0.1 to 99.9<br>
% attenuating material, and 0.1 to 90 % carrier. The carrier is a liquid used to<br>
form a dilution of the attenuating materials and binder to apply the coating.<br>
Examples of useful carriers are water, alcohols, alkanes, freons, and the like,<br>
most preferably water.<br>
Examples of polymeric binders useful in making coatings comprising<br>
attenuating materials are polyvinyl alcohols, cyanoacrylates, acrylics, and<br>
silicones. Presently the polymeric binders are limited in their use, because<br>
they tend to degrade in the high energy UV radiation. Examples of inorganic<br>
binders useful in making coatings comprising attenuating materials are sodium<br><br>
silicate, low-temperature sintered glasses, alkali oxide silicates, such as<br>
sodium, potassium and lithium silicates. Examples of sol gel binder precursors<br>
useful in making coatings comprising attenuating materials are aluminum tert<br>
butoxide, sodium silicate, tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), metal isopropoxides,<br>

The attenuating materials disclosed herein can be used in thin layers<br>
and/or multiple layers of different attenuating materials similar to dichroic filters<br>
also referred to dielectric filters; however, the attenuating materials disclosed<br>
herein do not work by the same mechanism as a dielectric filter, that is, they do<br>
not rely upon a structure comprised of alternating materials with differing<br>
indices of refraction. The materials of this invention use absorption<br>
mechanisms to selectively attenuate the radiation.<br>
The attenuating coatings are preferably applied to form a coating having<br>
a thickness from 0.1 to 2500 microns, more preferably a thickness from 0.5 to<br>
2500 microns. (A coating greater than 2500 microns is considered a block of<br>
the material). The coatings are preferably applied in multiple layers of the<br>
same attenuating material(s), preferably in the same coating composition. The<br>
coating of the attenuating materials on a reflector reduces the undesired<br>
radiation which impinges upon the attenuating materials two times: once on the<br>
radiation's way to the reflector and once after the radiation is reflected off the<br>
reflector, which is a factor to consider when formulating the attenuating<br>
materials to be applied to the reflector, and when estimating the useful life of<br>
the attenuating materials (particularly if liquid attenuating materials are in a<br>
passageway in front of the reflector). Also, depending upon the shape of the<br>
one or more reflectors of the radiation source, much of the radiation will be<br>
reflected off of the reflectors multiple times before it reaches the target.<br>
The reflector 14 which comprises the coating 36 of the attenuating<br>
material can comprise a reflective material, or a non-reflective or reflective<br>
reflector support 35 onto which a reflective coating (which may be a film or foil)<br>
is held. An example of a reflective material is metal. An example of a<br>
reflective reflector support 35 is a solid polished aluminum, which is thick<br>
enough to hold its shape, and is bolted or otherwise mounted into place around<br>
the lamp 11.<br>
Other examples of reflective materials which can be used alone as the<br>
reflector support 35 include: formed solids of barium sulfate, aluminum oxide,<br>
magnesium fluoride, and magnesium oxide. The formed solids can be formed<br>
by combining the reflective materials with metal oxides or powdered glass and<br>
sintering them to form a reflective support, or by combining the reflective<br><br>
materials with binders and forming a solid either in the shape of the support or<br>
machining the reflector out of the resulting formed solid. Other examples of<br>
coatings of reflective material which can be applied, or otherwise attached to a<br>
reflective or non-reflective reflector support 35 include: magnesium oxide,<br>
magnesium fluoride, barium sulfate and aluminum oxide, including thin sheets<br>
of aluminum, aluminum oxide, magnesium fluoride, barium sulfate and<br>
magnesium oxide which can be attached to a reflector support 35. These<br>
coatings or films can be formed by sintering the reflective materials with glass<br>
compositions, or forming films of the reflective materials with binders.<br>
Examples of materials which can be used as a non-reflective reflector support<br>
35 include: wood, polymers, metals and ceramics.<br>
The reflective coatings of the reflector support 35 can be coated by<br>
painting, plasma coating, spraying, dipping, casting, conversion coating, gel<br>
coating, etching, chemical vapor deposition, sputtering, or mechanical or<br>
chemical bonding of a thin film or foil of the reflective material to a reflective or<br>
non-reflective support. The preferred method of applying the reflective<br>
materials which are part of the reflector 14 is to paint or spray them onto a<br>
reflector support 35. To paint or spray them onto the support 35, an aqueous<br>
or non-aqueous suspension is formed with a binder. The preferred binders are<br>
polymeric, inorganic or a sol-gel, more preferred inorganic or sol gels.<br>
Examples of polymeric binders are polyvinyl alcohols, cyanoacrylates, acrylics,<br>
and silicones. Presently the polymeric binders are the least preferred, because<br>
it is believed that the UV radiation will cause them to degrade. Examples of *<br>
inorganic binders are sodium silicate, low-temperature sintered glasses, alkali<br>
oxide silicates, such as sodium, potassium and lithium silicates. Examples of<br>
sol gel precursors are listed above for the attenuating materials.<br>
An example of an attenuating coating composition is 1 part sodium<br>
silicate (binder), 10 parts lanthanum oxide (attenuating material) and 10 parts<br>
water (carrier). 10 layers of this suspension were sprayed onto a reflector<br>
which comprised an aluminum substrate (reflector support) having a barium<br>
sulfate coating (reflective material). The barium sulfate coating was made by<br>
spraying 20 layers of a composition comprising 1 part sodium silicate (binder),<br><br>
10 parts barium sulfate (reflective material) and 10 parts water (carrier) onto<br>
the aluminum substrate. Each coating was air dried between coatings.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the reflective materials and attenuating<br>
materials and optional binders can be combined and applied to a reflective or<br>
non-reflective reflector support 35 in a single coating which reflects the desired,<br>
e.g. germicidally-effective radiation, and attenuates the undesired radiation.<br>
The attenuating materials may act as the binder for the reflective material,<br>
therefore eliminating the need for a binder in the composition. Examples of<br>
materials which can act as the binder and attenuating material are dysprosium<br>
isopropoxide, polysiloxanes, and all the sol gels, listed above. The attenuating<br>
material and reflective material can be sintered to form a reflector coating 36<br>
composition having radiation attenuating properties. An example of a material<br>
which can be used as a sintering material is a low melting glass composition, to<br>
which the attenuating material and reflective materials can be added. These<br>
coatings preferably have a thickness between 0.1 and 2500 microns.<br>
Alternatively, a reflector 14, similar to the one shown in Fig.1, can be<br>
formed out of a formed solid comprising attenuating materials, reflective<br>
material, and optional binders. The composition is formed in the shape of a<br>
reflector 14 or the reflector 14 can be machined out of the formed solid which<br>
comprises the reflector materials, attenuating materials and optional binders.<br>
Further, the attenuating materials can be combined with metal oxides or<br>
powdered glass and reflective materials and sintered to form a reflector 14<br>
similar to the one shown in Fig. 1 which has attenuating and reflective<br>
properties. The just-described formed solids preferably have a thickness<br>
greater than 2500 microns.<br>
Presently it is not preferred to combine the reflective materials with the<br>
attenuating materials, because the radiation at undesired wavelengths may be<br>
reflected by the reflective materials before the attenuating materials have an<br>
opportunity to absorb the undesired wavelengths.<br>
The preferred attenuating materials are those that absorb the undesired<br>
radiation from 100 up to 240nm, and reflect the desired radiation from 240 to<br>
280nm which can be used alone or with optional binders and/or additives to<br>
form the reflectors in any of the embodiments described above. Examples of<br><br>
these attenuating materials are lanthanum oxide, yttrium oxide and ytterbium<br>
oxide. Using these reflective/attenuating materials to make a reflector, or a<br>
coating for a reflector support is the most preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention.<br>
Adding attenuating materials as part of the reflectors does not attenuate<br>
the undesired radiation which does not hit the reflector first before reaching the<br>
target. If necessary, to further protect the target from the radiation which would<br>
otherwise impinge on the target directly from the lamp, a reflective blocking<br>
element can be used so that only reflected radiation from which the undesired<br>
radiation has been attenuated can impinge on the target. The reflective<br>
blocking element 39 is shown in Figure 4. The reflective blocking element<br>
preferably has a simple geometric form, more preferably an optically<br>
concentrating form, and most preferably an integral form of the reflecting<br>
optics. Examples of useful shapes are a triangle (shown in Fig. 4) and a half<br>
circle. The reflective blocking element can comprise any of the reflector<br>
compositions described within this application, and may or may not be made<br>
with attenuating materials or a coating of attenuating materials. Preferably the<br>
reflective blocking element comprises an attenuating material, preferably either<br>
a liquid or solid attenuating material. It is preferred that the reflective blocking<br>
element has a diffuse reflective surface. Preferably, the blocking element is<br>
sized to occlude any direct radiation from the radiation source to the target.<br>
Fig. 5 shows an alternative embodiment of this invention. In Fig. 5 the<br>
reflector 14 comprises a reflector support 35, a material layer 47 and a<br>
transparent support 46. The transparent support 46 is transparent to at least a<br>
portion of the radiation which impinges upon it. The reflector support 35 can<br>
comprise any of the combinations of reflective or non-reflective supports, or<br>
coatings on the supports as described above. The material layer 47 comprises<br>
one or more solid attenuating materials, or can be any of the compositions<br>
comprising attenuating materials as described for Fig. 4; however, this<br>
embodiment is particularly suited for solid attenuating materials that will not<br>
stay in place without the presence of the transparent support 46, such as a<br>
packed powder. The material layer 47 can comprise an attenuating material<br>
alone, a mixture of reflective materials and attenuating materials, or an<br><br>
attenuating material that also reflects the desired radiation as described in<br>
reference to Fig. 4, except that the material layer 47 can be a packed powder.<br>
If the reflector comprises separate attenuating materials and reflective<br>
materials, it is preferred that the attenuating materials are located between the<br>
reflective materials and the radiation source, so that the undesirable radiation<br>
is attenuated by the attenuating materials before the desired, e.g. germicidally-<br>
effective, radiation is reflected by the reflective materials towards the target.<br>
The material layer 47 preferably has a thickness from 0.1 to 2500 microns.<br>
The transparent support 46, can be completely transparent to most or all<br>
of the wavelengths which impinge upon it, or the transparent support 46 can<br>
comprise a solid attenuating material which attenuates one or more of the<br>
undesired wavelengths of the radiation. Alternatively, the transparent support<br>
46 can have a passageway through which liquid attenuating materials are<br>
pumped or otherwise held within (not shown). The transparent support 46<br>
preferably comprises the glass, quartz or sapphire materials described above<br>
for the flow tube 13, lamp envelope 12, and/or protective window 15. The solid<br>
attenuating materials can be added to the transparent support 46 as a dopant<br>
in feed stock used to form the transparent support, or attenuating materials can<br>
be applied as a coating onto either or both sides of the transparent support 46.<br>
If the attenuating materials are applied to one side of the transparent support<br>
46, preferably it is the side 49 furthest from the lamp. The methods for<br>
applying the coating are as described above for earlier embodiments.<br>
Alternatively, reflective materials can be applied as a coating to the side 49 of<br>
the transparent support 46 furthest from the lamp, and the solid attenuating<br>
materials can be applied onto the other side 48 of the transparent support, if<br>
desired. In that embodiment, the material layer 47 and the reflector support 35<br>
(as shown) might not be necessary. If present, the coatings on the transparent<br>
support 46 will preferably be from 0.1 to 2500 microns.<br>
The preferred attenuating material for the material layer 47 used in<br>
combination with the transparent support 46 is a packed layer of powder<br>
consisting of the preferred solid attenuating materials listed above. As listed<br>
above, the most preferred solid attenuating materials are lanthanum oxide,<br>
yttrium oxide or ytterbium oxide or mixtures of these powders.<br><br>
Other preferred embodiments comprise reflective materials (either<br>
coating, solid blocks or dry powder) under a coating of a solid attenuating<br>
material. The preferred combinations of reflective materials and attenuating<br>
materials in the preferred embodiments are barium sulfate (reflective material)<br>
and lanthanum oxide (attenuating material); or magnesium fluoride (reflective<br>
material) and yttrium oxide (attenuating material), or magnesium oxide<br>
(reflective material) and ytterbium oxide (attenuating material), or aluminum<br>
oxide (reflective material) and lanthanum oxide (attenuating material), or<br>
different combinations of the reflective materials and attenuating materials, or<br>
mixtures of individual reflective materials and mixtures of individual attenuating<br>
materials.<br>
The preferred reflectors are diffuse reflectors and/or elliptically-shaped<br>
reflectors which are disclosed and described in provisional application US<br>
Serial No. 60/143,608 filed July 13, 1999 "Reflectors for UV Radiation Source",<br>
US Serial No.	(VTN-0463), filed concurrently herewith incorporated<br>
herein by reference. The preferred lamp system comprises two lamps each<br>
having a shaped reflector, preferably an elliptically-shaped reflector, within<br>
which is a target volume (the volume occupied by the target container and/or<br>
product) having an optimized amount of space or minimal space between the<br>
target and the reflectors during the exposure of the target to radiation. The<br>
space adjacent to the target area or volume allows radiation to pass by the<br>
target without passing through the target. Therefore, particularly for a multiple<br>
lamp and/or reflector radiation system, the space should be minimized. The -<br>
diffuse reflectors provide uniform energy to the target area or volume.<br>
Another embodiment of this invention is a radiation system having a<br>
removable solid attenuating material between the radiation source and the<br>
target. Fig. 6 shows this embodiment wherein a removable solid attenuating<br>
material is a film 56 which is mounted adjacent to the protective window 15 of a<br>
flash lamp 10. (The flash lamp 10 is as shown in the earlier figures). The<br>
removable solid attenuating material 56 can comprise any of the above listed<br>
solid attenuating materials which are either combined with a binder to form a<br>
removable solid attenuating material 56, or the solid attenuating materials can<br>
be sintered with optional glass or metal oxides to form a solid, or a dry powder<br><br>
can be packed into a glass support. These removable solid materials 56, like<br>
the coatings, and reflectors made for the embodiments described above are<br>
very durable. The removable solid attenuating material 56 can be a block or<br>
plate. The block or plate preferably has a thickness of from 100 to 2500<br>
microns. In another embodiment the removable solid attenuating material 56 is<br>
a sheet or film preferably comprising a polymeric material, e.g. polyamides<br>
(nylons), or polyolefins, such as polypropylene, preferably nylons such as<br>
nylon-6 and nylon-6,6. The sheet or the film may only have temporary<br>
effectiveness and may require replacement with a new or different piece or<br>
area of the removable solid attenuating material. In the preferred embodiment,<br>
the removable solid attenuating material 56 is a film which can be on rollers<br>
(not shown) which advances an exposed area of the removable solid<br>
attenuating material 56 to a never-before-exposed portion after a specified<br>
amount of exposure to the UV radiation source. The film preferably has a<br>
thickness of from 10 to 100 microns.<br>
For embodiments in which a product to be exposed to the UV radiation<br>
is housed in a container, another alternative is to add the attenuating materials<br>
to the container or to form the container out of attenuating materials, or to add<br>
the attenuating materials to the product, or to the solution in which the product<br>
is stored, e.g. contact lens solutions. Any of the above listed attenuating<br>
materials, preferably the solid attenuating materials, can be applied to the<br>
container by all the methods described above e.g. coating, dipping, etc., or the<br>
attenuating materials can be included in the container formulation used to<br>
make the container, or the materials for the container can be selected based<br>
on their ability to attenuate the undesired radiation and transmit the desired<br>
radiation. For example, for the preferred embodiment, a container is used to<br>
house a contact lens to be sterilized. The container comprises a bowl and a<br>
lidstock. The lidstock can comprise a nylon layer and/or attenuating materials,<br>
such as lanthanum oxide, or adipic acid (hexanedioic acid) and various<br>
adipates, barium adipate, calcium adipate, magnesium adipate, disodium<br>
adipate or carboxylic acids, can be added to the molten polypropylene or<br>
polystyrene before injection molding the lidstock or the bowl. Other useful<br>
materials for the container are disclosed in Peck, et al, US Serial<br><br>
No.	entitled "Package for Medical Device" (VTN-0445) which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Alternatively, attenuating materials such as polyamides (nylons) can be<br>
co-injected with the polypropylene to form a multi-layered bowl that filters out<br>
the damaging radiation.<br>
Alternatively, attenuating materials, e.g. sol gels, can be chemically<br>
vapor deposited to the lidstock material which protects the product from UV<br>
radiation and limits water transport through the lidstock. Lanthanum oxide is<br>
an example of an attenuating material which would be useful for this purpose.<br>
Other sol gel precursors useful in the lidstock include: Barium<br>
hexafluoroacetylacetonate, Barium (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3)5-heptanedionate),<br>
Lanthanum acetylacetonate hydrate, Lanthanum (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-<br>
heptanedionate), Magnesium acetylacetonate dihydrate, Magnesium (2,2,6,6-<br>
tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionate), Ytterbium acetylacetonate, Ytterbium<br>
hexafluoroacetylacetonate, Ytterbium (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionate),<br>
Yttrium acetylacetonate, Yttrium hexafluoroacetylacetonate, and Yttrium<br>
(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionate).<br>
The preferred attenuating materials are those that attenuate the<br>
undesired radiation and reflect, transmit or re-emit the desired radiation and<br>
have a sharp transition between the absorption of the undesired radiation and<br>
reflection, transmission or re-emission of the desired radiation. It is preferred<br>
that the change in % reflectivity/nm is greater than 2, more preferably greater<br>
than 3, most preferably greater than 4 in area of the radiation spectrum where<br>
the transition from desirable wavelengths of radiation to undesirable<br>
wavelengths of radiation is located. For the preferred embodiment in which the<br>
undesired radiation is the damaging radiation and the desired radiation is the<br>
germicidally-effective radiation, the sharp transition preferably takes place from<br>
230 to 250nm, more preferably from 235 to 245nm, and most preferably from<br>
239 to 240nm.<br>
Combinations of the above described embodiments are contemplated<br>
by this invention to produce an additive effect on reducing the undesired<br>
radiation, and increasing the ratio of the desired to the undesired radiation.<br>
The most preferred embodiments are the ones which use durable attenuating<br><br>
materials that do not have to be monitored or changed often. It is preferred<br>
that the attenuating materials can survive the application of 100 pulses at 3<br>
J/cm2, more preferred greater than 10,000 pulses, and most preferably greater<br>
than 1,000,000 pulses at 3 J/cm2 total radiation before undergoing a significant<br>
change in their ability to attenuate the undesired radiation. The preferred<br>
embodiments are to add solid attenuating materials to the lamp envelope<br>
and/or flow tube around the lamp envelope, or to add the attenuating materials<br>
as a coating to the reflector.<br>
This invention will be further illustrated by the following example.<br>
Example 1<br>
Treated Lenses<br>
-1.00D Acuvue® (Etafilcon A) contact lenses each in polypropylene<br>
bowls with 500µl of borate buffered saline solution, and a clear lidstock heat-<br>
sealed to the bowl were placed six at a time into the cavity of a PurePulse<br>
bright light system. The lenses in the containers were subjected to 4 flashes,<br>
from two xenon flash lamps flashing simultaneously, to provide about 12 J/cm2<br>
radiation from 200-3000nm of which about 850mJ/cm2 was radiation from 240<br>
to 280nm. The contact lenses were tested for water content both by refractive<br>
index and GRAVIMETRIC methods. The modulus and base curve were also<br>
measured. The measurements are in Table 2.<br>
Treated Lenses With Attenuating Material<br>
-1.00D Acuvue® contact lenses packaged as described above were<br>
treated as described above, except that a piece of 12µm thick nylon film was<br>
placed beneath the containers on the bowl side of the containers.<br>
The same measurements as described above were taken. The<br>
measurements are in Table 2.<br><br>
Untreated Lenses<br>
Measurements of the characteristics of 48 untreated -1.00D Acuvue<br>
Lenses were also made. They are listed in Table 2.<br><br>
This example shows that the nylon attenuates the undesired radiation<br>
and partially protects the contact lens polymer from damage.<br>
Example 2<br>
Treated Lenses Without Attenuating Material<br>
Acuvue® (Etafilcon A) contact lenses each in polypropylene bowls with<br>
500µl of borate buffered saline solution, and a clear lidstock heatsealed to the<br>
bowl were placed into the cavity of a PurePulse bright light system. The lenses<br>
in the containers were subjected to various amounts of energy provided by two<br>
xenon flash lamps flashing simultaneously. The water content of the bowl side<br>
of the contact lenses was measured by the Abbe method after treatment at<br>
different energy levels. (Each point on the graph represents the average<br>
measurement for ten contact lenses.) These measurements are plotted in<br>
Figure 7.<br>
Treated Lenses With Attenuating Material<br>
Acuvue® contact lenses packaged as described above were treated as<br>
described above, except that instead of using the specular polished aluminum<br>
PurePulse reflectors in the cavity, the specular reflectors were coated with 30<br>
coats of barium sulfate and 10 coats of lanthanum oxide over the barium<br><br>
sulfate. The coating materials were spray coated at room temperature and<br>
dried between the application of each coat. The barium sulfate coating<br>
consisted of a 1:1:0.1 weight ratio of barium sulfate, water and sodium silicate.<br>
The lanthanum oxide coating consisted of a 1:1:0.1 weight ratio of lanthanum<br>
oxide, water and sodium silicate. The same measurements as described<br>
above were repeated for the contact lenses treated by the system having<br>
reflectors with attenuating materials. These measurements are plotted in<br>
Figure 7.<br>
Figure 7 shows that the attenuating coating on the reflectors protects<br>
the contact lenses from damage, which is evidenced by the decreased change<br>
in equilibrium water content for the contact lenses when treated with a system<br>
having attenuating materials in the reflectors as compared to the system<br>
without the attenuating material in the reflectors.<br>
Comparative Example<br>
The materials in Table 3 were measured the same way as the materials<br>
in Table 1. These materials would not be useful as attenuating materials in this<br>
invention.<br><br>
