The present invention relates to pharmaceutical composition and a process for preparing the pharmaceutical composition containing the bisphosphonic acid(s) or salt(s) thereof, which composition will be used for the treatment of osteoporosis.<br>
The present pharmaceutical composition comprises by weight, about 5-40% by weight of an active ingredient selected from the group consisting of:<br>
4-amino-1-hydroxybutylidene-1,1-bisphosphonic acid,<br>
N-methyM-amino-1-hydroxybutylidene-1 ,1-bisphosphonic acid,<br>
4-(N,N-dimethylamino)-1-hydroxybutylidene-1,1-bisphosphonicacid,<br>
3-amino-1-hydroxypropylidene-1,1-bisphosphonic acid,<br>
3-(N,N-dimethylamino)-1-hydroxypropylidene-1,1-bisphosphonic acid,<br>
1-hydroxy-3-(N-methyl-N-pentylamino) propylidene-1,1-bisphosphonic acid,<br>
1-hydroxy - 2- [3-pyridinyl] ethylidene-1, 1-bisphosphonic acid;<br>
4-(hydroxymethylene-1,1-bisphosphonic acid)-piperidine;<br>
In the present invention the preferred bisphosphonic acid is 4-amino-1-hydroxybutylidene-1, 1-bisphosphonic acid, i.e., alendronic acid; more preferable is its monosodium salt trihydrate, viz., alendronate sodium trihydrate, or other bisphosphonic acid(s) or salt(s) thereof, viz., etidronate, clodronate, pamidronate or ibandronate.<br>
Method of preparation of bisphosphonic acid may be found in, U.S. Pat. No. 3,962,432; U.S. Pat. No. 4,954,598; U.S. Pat. No. 4,267,108; U.S. Pat. No. 4,327,039; U.S. Pat. No. 4,407,761; U.S. Pat.

The disadvantages of all the above inventions are that the compositions release the active ingredient almost instantaneously causing oesophageal discomfort and ulceritis due to the release of the active ingredient in the upper Gastro Intestinal Tract (GIT). The medication has to taken on arising for the day at least 30 minutes before the first food, beverage or medication of the day with a full glass (200ml) of plain water only. The patients are advised to sit upright for about 30 minutes after the ingestion of medication and until their first food of the day. Patients are not allowed to take medication at bedtime or before arising on the day.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition for oral administration substantially comprising a core having bisphosphonic acid or salts thereof, coated with an acid resistant coat thereby releasing the active ingredient only in the alkaline environment of the lower GIT.<br>
The purpose of the enteric coating employed in the present invention is to resist the acidic environment of the stomach, thus avoiding oesophageal irritation. Accordingly, the disadvantage of the prescribed method of taking the medication, as explained above, can be overcome by the present invention.<br>
The core containing of bisphosphonic acid(s) or salt(s) thereof can be coated with a hydrophilic polymer known in the art (seal coating) E.g.<br><br>
Hydroxy Propyl Methyl Cellulose (HPMC), Hydroxy Propyl Cellulose (HPC), Polyvinyl Pyrrolidone (PVP), Shellac, cellulose gums, xanthan gums, thereupon being coated with the enteric polymer.<br>
A wide variety of conventional enteric coatings may be employed in the present invention, including for example: cellulose acetate phthalate, Hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose phthalate (HPMCP); hydroxypropyl cellulose acetyl succinate; polyvinyl acetate phthalate; copolymerized methacrylic acid / methacrylic acid methyl esters, such as Eudragit L 12.5, Eudragit L 100 55 or Eudragit S 100; and mixtures thereof. The enteric coating may contain conventional plasticizers, pigments and /or dispersants, including for example polyethylene glycols, propylene glycol, triacetin, triethyl citrate, and Citroflex, dibutyl sebacate, glidants like talc, aerosil.<br>
The enteric coating can be applied in any suitable manner, for example in the form of an aqueous dispersion in water, or other dispersing medium, or in the form of a solution. It is preferred that a dispersion or solution of the enteric coating is treated with an alkali in order to neutralize at least part of any free acid content. The alkali may be, for example, a carbonate or hydroxide of sodium, potassium, magnesium or calcium.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention may comprise one or more additives. Examples of particularly useful additives include a diluent and a lubricant to aid flow of the active ingredient during manufacture. The diluent may be, for example, lactose. The lubricant may be for example, magnesium stearate and /or talcum. It will be appreciated that the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may contain any one or   more   other   additives   conventionally   used   in   the   formulation   of<br><br><br>
pharmaceutical compositions. The excipients known in the art of manufacturing these dosage forms include lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, dicalcium phosphate, HPC, L-klucel, HPMC starch, sugar, disintegrants such as starch and derivatives of starch, crosscarmellose sodium, sodium carboxy methyl cellulose and its derivatives, crospovidone, etc.<br>
