				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a forming structure for making a polymeric web<br>
exhibiting a soft and silky tactile impression on at least one surface. More particularly, the<br>
present invention relates forming structure for making a three-dimensional polymeric web<br>
exhibiting a soft and silky tactile impression that can be used as a body-facing topsheet in<br>
disposable absorbent<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is extremely desirable to construct disposable articles, such as absorptive devices,<br>
including sanitary napkins, pantyliners, interlabial devices, diapers, training pants, incontinent<br>
devices, wound dressings and the like, with a soft cloth-like surface feel to the user's skin at any<br>
anticipated points of contact. Likewise, it has long been known in the disposable articles art to<br>
construct absorptive devices that present a dry surface feel to the user, especially during use. By<br>
having a soft, cloth-like body-facing surface that retains a dry surface feel during use, an<br>
absorptive device gives improved wearing comfort, and minimizes the development of<br>
undesirable skin conditions due to prolonged exposure to moisture absorbed within the absorptive<br>
device.<br>
While woven and non-woven fibrous webs are often employed as body-facing topsheets<br>
for absorptive devices because of their pleasant surface feel, macroscopically expanded, three<br>
dimensional, apertured polymeric webs such as the commercially successful DRI-WEAVEâ„¢<br>
topsheet marketed by Procter &amp; Gamble Company have also been utilized. One viable polymeric<br>
web of this type is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,342,314 issued to Radel et al. on Aug. 3,1982.<br>
Such webs have been shown to exhibit desirable fluid transport and fluid retaining characteristics.<br>
Desirable fluid transport characteristics allow the topsheet to acquire fluids, such as urine or<br>
menses, and pass to fluid into the absorptive article. Once absorbed into the absorptive article, the<br>
fluid retaining feature of the topsheet preferably prevents rewet, i.e., the movement of fluid back<br>
through the topsheet. Rewet can be a result of at least two causes: (1) squeezing out of the<br>
absorbed fluid due to pressure on the absorptive article; and/or (2) wetness entrapped within or on<br>
the topsheet Preferably, both properties, fluid acquisition and fluid retention, are maximized.<br>
Said differently, preferably a topsheet will exhibit high rates of fluid acquisition, and low levels of<br>
rewet<br>
Other macroscopically expanded, three dimensional, apertured polymeric webs are<br>
known. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,463,045 issued to Ahr et al. on July 31,1984 discloses a<br>
macroscopically expanded three-dimensional polymeric web that exhibits a substantially non-<br>
glossy visible surface and cloth-like tactile impression. Ahr et al. teaches the criteria which must<br>
be met with respect to the regularly spaced pattern of surface aberrations in order to diffusely<br>
reflect incident light and thereby eliminate gloss. Ahr, et al teaches that the surface aberrations in<br>
the web should exhibit an average amplitude of at least about 0.2 mils (i.e.,0.0002 inches), and<br>
most preferably at least about 0.3 mils (i.e., 0.0003 inches) for a more clothlike or fiberlike tactile<br>
impression in the resultant web. Despite its advancements in eliminating gloss, the structure of<br>
the surface aberrations of the web in Ahr, et al. can lack desired softness. As recognized in the<br>
art, for example is U.S. Pat. No. 4,629,643, issued to Curro etl al. (discussed below), the lack of<br>
desired softness is believed to be due to the structure of each Aberration, which can be described<br>
as having the properties of an "arch" that behaves as a discrete structural unit, resisting deflection.<br>
This lack of sufficient deflection detracts from the softness impression experienced by the user's<br>
skin.<br>
One proposed solution to improve the softness impression to the web of Ahr et al., was<br>
disclosed in the aforementioned U.S. Pat No. 4,629,643 ( Curro, et al. '643) Curro, et al. '643<br>
discloses a microapertured polymeric web exhibiting a fine scale pattern of discrete surface<br>
aberrations. Each of these surface aberrations have a maximum amplitude and, unlike the web<br>
structure disclosed in Ahr, et al. at least one microaperature is provided that is substantially<br>
coincidental with the maximum amplitude of each surface aberration. The forming of<br>
microapertures at the maximum amplitude of each surface aberration provides a volcano-like cusp<br>
with petal shaped edges. It is believed that the resultant web Surface that is in contact with the<br>
human skin is of smaller total area and is less resistant to compressive and shear forces than the<br>
unapertured "arch-like" structures taught by Ahr et al.<br>
Although the microapertured film of Curro, et al. '643 imparts superior tactile impression<br>
to the skin of the user, it has some drawbacks related to certain fluid handling properties when<br>
used as a topsheet in absorbent articles. For example, it has been found mat a web as disclosed in<br>
Curro, et al. '643, when used as a topsheet on a sanitary pad can permit an unacceptably high<br>
amount of rewet, i.e., fluid that returns back to the skin-facing surface of the topsheet after<br>
initially having passed through the topsheet to be absorbed by the sanitary napkin. In particular, it<br>
appears mat a web according to Curro '643 can be more susceptible to rewet tinder pressure. This<br>
is because when such a product is used as a topsheet in a catamenial product, for example,<br>
absorbed fluid can be urged back out of the product through the many microapertures of the<br>
topsheet It appears mat each of the microapertures in the structure of Curro, et al. '643 can<br>
provide a pathway for fluid to escape from an underlying absorbent core in an absorbent article<br>
under the pressure of normal wearing conditions. These pathways in the web structures therefore<br>
cause decreased fluid retention and increased rewet in the absorbent structures.<br>
Attempts at alleviating the shortcoming of Curro '643, i.e., attempts to both maximize<br>
softness and reduce rewet, can be found, for example, in U.S.i Pat. No. 6,228,462 issued to Lee, et<br>
al., on May 8,2001. Lee discloses a compression resistant web comprising rigid polymers. The<br>
compression resistance of the rigid polymers helps reduce rewet, but the rigid polymers utilized'<br>
tend to decrease the softness of the web.<br>
Furthermore, the hydroforming processes disclosed in Curro, et al. '643 and Lee "462 for<br>
making macroscopically expanded, three dimensional, apertured polymeric webs results in a<br>
formed film that must be dried after hydroforming. Due to the many interstices of the<br>
microapertures that can retain water, drying commercial quantities of these webs consumes<br>
significant amounts of energy, and can require significant capital investments in drying<br>
equipment One example of an approach to effectively dry such webs is disclosed in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 4,465,422 issued September 22,1987 to Curro, et al.<br>
One further drawback associated with the webs disclosed in Curro '643 and Lee '462<br>
when used as topsheets on sanitary napkins is the tendency of the microapertures to entrap fluid,<br>
such as menses. The entrapment can be in the microapertures themselves and/or between adjacent<br>
microapertures. Fluid so entrapped remains at or near the surface of the web, and can, therefore<br>
be in contact with the wearer's skin for prolonged periods of time. This contact negatively affects<br>
the skin health of the wearer and causes the topsheet to not have a clean appearance post-use.<br>
Another attempt at making a soft, three-dimensional, macroscopically-expanded web<br>
having an improved functional surface is U.S. Pat No. 5,670,110, issued to Dirk, et al. on<br>
September 23,1997. The web of Dirk et al. utilizes fibrils achieved via a screen printing roll.<br>
However, screen printing is a relatively slow process for making commercial webs for consumer<br>
articles.<br>
Accordingly, it would be beneficial to have an improved formed film web that has<br>
superior tactile impression and superior fluid handling properties.<br>
Additionally, it would be beneficial to have a formed film web that has superior tactile<br>
impression and provides for superior fluid retention and rewet characteristics.<br>
Additionally, it would be beneficial to have a formed film web that has superior tactile<br>
impression and provides for superior cleanliness for hygiene articles.<br>
Additionally, it would be beneficial to have an improved process for making a formed<br>
film web that has superior tactile impression and provides for superior fluid retention and rewet<br>
characteristics.<br>
Finally, it would be beneficial to have an improved apparatus and method of making a<br>
forming structure for forming a formed film web that has superior tactile impression and provides<br>
for superior fluid retention and rewet characteristics.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIG. 1 is an enlarged, partially segmented perspective illustration of a prior art<br>
macroscopically-expanded, three-dimensional, fluid pervious polymeric web 40 formed generally<br>
in accordance with the aforementioned U.S. Patent 4,342,314; Webs of mis type have been found<br>
to be highly suitable for use as a topsheet in absorbent articles such as sanitary napkins,<br>
pantyliners, interlabial devices, and the like. The fluid pervious web 40 exhibits a plurality of<br>
macroscopic surface aberrations that can be apertures, such as primary apertures 41. Primary<br>
apertures 41 are formed by a multiplicity of interconnecting members, such as fiber like elements,<br>
e.g., 42,43,44,45 and 46, that are interconnected to one another to define a continuous first<br>
surface 50 of the web 40. Each fiber like element has a base portion, e.g., base portion 51, located<br>
in plane 52 of first surface 50. Each base portion has a sidewall portion, e.g., sidewall portion 53,<br>
attached to each longitudinal edge thereof. The sidewall portions extend generally in the direction<br>
of a discontinuous second surface 55 of web 40. The intersecting sidewall portions are<br>
interconnected to one another intermediate the first and second surfaces of the web, and terminate<br>
substantially concurrently with one another in the plane 56 of the second surface 55. In some<br>
embodiments, the base portion 51 may have surface aberrations 58 in accordance with the<br>
aforementioned Ahr '045 patent<br>
As used herein, the term "macroscopically expanded" refers to the structure of a web<br>
formed from a precursor web or film, e.g., a planar web, that has been caused to conform to the<br>
surface of a three-dimensional forming structure so that bom sides, or surfaces, of the precursor<br>
web are permanently altered due to at least partial conformance of the precursor web to the three-<br>
dimensional pattern of the forming structure. Such macroscopically-expanded webs are typically<br>
caused to conform to the surface of the forming structure by embossing (i.e., when the forming<br>
structure exhibits a pattern comprised primarily of male projections), by debossing (i.e., when the<br>
forming structure exhibits a pattern comprised primarily of female depressions, or apertures), or<br>
by a combination of both.<br>
As used herein, the term "macroscopic" refers to structural features or elements that are<br>
readily visible and distinctly discernable to a human having 20/20 vision when the perpendicular<br>
distance between the viewer's eye and the web is about 12 inches. Conversely, the term<br>
"microscopic" is utilized to refer to structural features or elements that are not readily visible and<br>
distinctly discernable to a human having 20/20 vision when the perpendicular distance between<br>
the viewer's eye and the plane of the web is about 12 inches. In general, as used herein, the<br>
primary apertures of a web disclosed herein are macroscopic, and surface aberrations, such as<br>
hair-like fibrils as disclosed more fully below are considered microscopic.<br>
The term "planar" as used herein to refers to the overall condition of a precursor web or<br>
film when viewed by the naked eye on a macroscopic scale, prior to permanently deforming the<br>
web into a three-dimensional formed film. In this context, extruded films prior to post-extrusion<br>
processing and films that do not exhibit significant degree of permanent macroscopic three-<br>
dimensionality, e.g., deformation out of the plane of the film, would generally be described as<br>
planar.<br>
As utilized herein, the term "interconnecting members" refers to some or all of the<br>
elements of a web, e.g., web 40 in FIG. 1, portions of which serve to define the primary<br>
apertures by a continuous network. As can be appreciated from the description of FIG. 1 and the<br>
present invention herein, the interconnecting members, e.g., fiber like elements 42,43,44,45,<br>
and 46, are inherently continuous, with contiguous interconnecting elements blending into one<br>
another in mutually adjoining transition portions. Individual interconnecting members can be<br>
best described with reference to FIG. 1 as those portions of the web disposed between any two<br>
adjacent primary apertures, originating in the first surface and extending into the second surface.<br>
On the first surface of the web the interconnecting members collectively form a continuous<br>
network, or pattern, the continuous network of interconnecting members defining the primary<br>
apertures, and on the second surface of the web interconnecting sidewalk of the interconnecting<br>
members collectively form a discontinuous pattern of secondary apertures. Interconnecting<br>
members are described more generally below with reference to FIG. 6.<br>
In a three-dimensional, macroscopicaUy-expanded web, the interconnecting members<br>
may be described as channel-like. Their two dimensional cross-section may also be described as<br>
"U-shaped", as in the aforementioned Radel '314 patent, or "upwardly concave-shaped", as<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,514,105, issued on May 7,1996 to Goodman, Jr., et al.<br>
"Upwardly-concave-shaped" as used herein, and as represented in FIG. 1, describes the<br>
orientation of the channel-like shape of the interconnecting members with relation to the<br>
surfaces of the web, with a base portion 51 generally in the first surface 50, and the legs, e.g.,<br>
sidewall portions 53, of the channel extending from the base portion 51 in the direction of the<br>
second surface 55, with the channel opening being substantially in the second surface 55. In<br>
general, for a plane cutting through the web, e.g., web 40, orthogonal to the plane, e.g., plane 52,<br>
of the first surface 50 and intersecting any two adjacent primary apertures, e.g., apertures 41, the<br>
resulting cross-section of an interconnecting member disposed therein will exhibit a generally<br>
upwardly concave shape that may be substantially U-shaped.<br>
The term "continuous" when used herein to describe the first surface of a<br>
macroscopicaUy-expanded, three-dimensional formed film web, refers to the uninterrupted<br>
character of the first surface generally in the plane of the first surface. Thus, any point on the first<br>
surface can be reached from any other point on the first surface without substantially leaving the<br>
first surface. Conversely, as utilized herein, the term "discontinuous" when used to describe the<br>
second surface of a three-dimensionally formed film web refers to the interrupted character of the<br>
second surface generally in the plane of the second surface. Thus, any point on the second surface<br>
cannot necessarily be reached from any other point on the second surface without substantially<br>
leaving the second surface in the plane of the second surface.<br>
FIG. 2 shows an enlarged, partially segmented, perspective illustration of a portion of<br>
another prior art polymeric microapertured web 110 formed generally in accordance with the<br>
aforementioned Curro '643 patent. The microapertured surface aberrations 120 can be formed by<br>
a hydroforming process in which a high-pressure liquid jet is utilized to force the web to conform<br>
to a three-dimensional support member. As shown, ruptures which coincide substantially with the<br>
maximum amplitude of each micropertured surface aberration 120 result in the formation of a<br>
volcano-shaped aperture 125 having relatively thin, irregularly shaped petals 126 about its<br>
periphery. The relatively thin, petal-shaped edges of the aperture of such a web provide for<br>
increased softness impression on the skin of a user when compared, for example, to the web of<br>
Ahr '045. It is believed that this softness impression is due to the relative lack of resistance to<br>
compression and shear afforded by the surface aberrations having volcano-shaped apertures.<br>
As mentioned above, although the microapertured film of Curro '643 imparts a superior<br>
tactile impression of softness, it can also permit undesirable rewet when used as a topsheet on a<br>
disposable absorbent article. The web of the present invention solves this problem by providing<br>
for softness via surface aberrations that exhibit low resistance to compression and shear,<br>
comparable to the web of Curro '643, and yet do not permit fluid flow via microapertures.<br>
Therefore, one benefit of the web of the present invention is superior softness together with<br>
minimal rewet when used as a topsheet on a disposable absorbent article, such as a sanitary<br>
napkin.<br>
FIG. 3 is an enlarged, partially segmented perspective illustration of a fluid pervious,<br>
macroscopically-expanded, three-dimensional polymeric web 80 of the present invention. The<br>
geometric configuration of the macroscopic surface aberrations, e.g., primary apertures 71, of the<br>
polymeric web can be generally similar to that of the prior art web 40 illustrated in FIG. 1.<br>
Primary apertures 71 may be referred to as "apertures" or "macroapertures" herein, and refer to<br>
openings in the web that permit fluid communication between a first surface 90 of web 80 and a<br>
second surface 85 of web 80. The primary apertures 71 of the web shown in FIG. 3 are defined in<br>
the plane 102 of first surface 90 by a continuous network of interconnecting members, e.g.,<br>
members 91,92,93,94, and 95 interconnected to one another; The shape of primary apertures 71<br>
as projected in the plane of the first surface 90 may be in the shape of polygons, e.g., squares,<br>
hexagons, etc., in an ordered or random pattern. In a preferred embodiment primary apertures 71<br>
are in the shape of modified ovals, and in one embodiment primary apertures 71 are in the general<br>
shape of a tear drop. Polymer web 80 exhibits a plurality of surface aberrations 220 in the form of<br>
hair-like fibrils 225, described more fully below.<br>
In a three-dimensional, microaperturcd polymeric web 80 of the present invention, each<br>
interconnecting member comprises a base portion, e.g., base portion 81, located generally in plane<br>
102, and each base portion has sidewall portions, e.g., sidewall portions 83 extending from each<br>
longitudinal edge thereof. Sidewall portions 83 extend generally in the direction of the second<br>
surface 85 of the web 80 and join to sidewalls of adjoining interconnecting members intermediate<br>
the first and second surfaces, 90 and 85, respectively, and terminate substantially concurrently<br>
with one another to define secondary apertures, e.g., secondary apertures 72 in the plane 106 of<br>
second surface 85.<br>
FIG. 6 is a plan view of representative primary aperture shapes projected in the plane of<br>
the first surface of an alternative embodiment of a three-dimensional, macroapertured polymer<br>
web of the present invention. While a repeating partem of uniform shapes, for example a<br>
tessellating pattern, is preferred, the shape of primary apertures, e.g., apertures 71, may be<br>
generally circular, polygonal, or mixed, and may be arrayed in an ordered pattern or in a random<br>
pattern.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6 the interconnecting members, e.g., interconnecting members 97 and<br>
98, are each inherently continuous, with contiguous interconnecting elements blending into one<br>
another in mutually adjoining transition zones or portions, e.g., portions 87. In general transition<br>
portions are defined by the largest circle that can be inscribed tangent to any three adjacent<br>
apertures. It is understood that for certain patterns of apertures the inscribed circle of the<br>
transition portions may be tangent to more than three adjacent; apertures. For illustrative<br>
purposes, interconnecting members may be thought of as beginning or ending substantially at the<br>
centers of the transition portions, such as interconnecting members 97 and 98. Interconnecting<br>
members need not be linear, but may be curvilinear. The sidewalls of the interconnecting<br>
members can be described as interconnecting to the sidewalls of adjacent, contiguous<br>
interconnecting members. Exclusive of portions of the transition zones and portions including<br>
hair-like fibrils, as disclosed below, cross-sections of interconnecting members transverse to the<br>
longitudinal centerline between the beginning and end of the interconnecting member may be<br>
generally described as U-shape. However, the transverse cross-section need not be uniform or U-<br>
shaped along the entire length of the interconnecting member, and for certain primary aperture<br>
configurations it may not be uniform along most of its length. In particular, in transition zones or<br>
portions interconnecting members blend into contiguous interconnecting members and transverse<br>
cross-sections in the transition zones or portions may exhibit substantially non-uniform U-shapes,<br>
or no discernible U-shape.<br>
FIG. 4 is a further enlarged, partial view of the three-dimensional polymeric web 80<br>
shown in FIG. 3. The three-dimensional polymeric web 80 comprises a polymer film 120, i.e.,<br>
the precursor film, which can be a single layer of extruded polymer or a multilayer coextruded or<br>
laminate film. As shown in FIG. 4, film 120 is a two layer laminate comprising a first layer 101<br>
and a second layer 103. Laminate materials may be coextruded, as is known in the art for making<br>
laminate films, including films comprising slrin layers. While it is presently preferred that, as<br>
shown in FIG. 4, the polymeric layers, e.g., layers 101 and 103, terminate substantially<br>
concurrently in the plane of the second surface 106 it is not presently believed to be essential that<br>
they do so. One or more layers may extend further toward the second surface than the other(s).<br>
FIG. 4 shows a plurality of surface aberrations 220 in the form of hair-like fibrils 225.<br>
The hair-like fibrils are formed as protruded extensions of the polymeric web 80, generally on the<br>
first surface 90 thereof. The number, size, and distribution of hair-like fibrils 225 on polymeric<br>
web 80 can be predetermined based on desired skin feel. For applications as a topsheet in<br>
disposable absorbent articles, it is preferred that hair-like fibrils 225 protrude only from the base<br>
portion 81 in first surface 90 of polymeric web 80, as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4. Therefore, when<br>
web 80 is used as a topsheet in a disposable absorbent article, the web can be oriented such that<br>
the hair-like fibrils 225 are skin contacting for superior softness impression, and yet, the hair-like<br>
fibrils 225 do not obstruct fluid flow through macroapertures |71. Moreover, having hair-like<br>
fibrils 225 with closed distal portions 226 results in reduced rewet, i.e., reduced amounts of fluid<br>
being re-introduced to the surface of the topsheet after having been first passed through the<br>
topsheet to underlying absorbent layers.<br>
As shown in cross-section FIG. 5, hair-like fibrils 225 can be described as protruding<br>
from first surface 90 of web 80. As such, hair-like fibrils 225 can be described as being integral<br>
with film 120, and formed by permanent local plastic deformation of film 120. Hair-like fibrils<br>
can be described as having a side wall 227 defining an open proximal portion 229 and a closed<br>
distal portion 226.  Hair-like fibrils 225 have a height h measured from a minimum amplitude<br>
Amin between adjacent fibrils to a maximum amplitude Amu at the closed distal portion 226.<br>
Hair-like fibrils have a diameter d, which for a generally cylindrical structure is the outside<br>
diameter at a lateral cross-section. By "lateral" is meant generally parallel to the plane of the first<br>
surface 102. For non-uniform lateral cross-sections, and/or nbn-cylindrical structures of hair-like<br>
fibrils, diameter d is measured as the average lateral cross-sectional dimension at Yz the height h<br>
of the fibril, as shown in FIG. 5. Thus, for each hair-like fibril 225, an aspect ratio, defined as<br>
h/d, can be determined. Hair-like fibrils 225 can have an aspect ratio h/d of at least 0.5. The<br>
aspect ratio can be 1, or 1.5 and is preferably at least about 2.<br>
In general, because the actual height h of any individual hair-like fibril 225 can be<br>
difficult to determine, and because the actual height may vary, an average height havg of a<br>
plurality of hair-like fibrils can be determined by determining an average minimum amplitude<br>
Amta and an average maximum amplitude Aâ€žm over a predetermined area of web 80. Likewise,<br>
for varying cross-sectional dimensions, an average dimension davg can be determined for a<br>
plurality of hair-like fibrils 225. Such amplitude and other dimensional measurements can be<br>
made by any method known in the art, such as by computer aided scanning microscopy and data<br>
processing. Therefore, an average aspect ratio ARavg of the hair-like fibrils 225 for a<br>
predetermined portion of the web can be expressed as bavg/dtvg.<br>
The dimensions h and d for hair-like fibrils 225 can be indirectly determined based on the<br>
known dimensions of a forming structure, as disclosed more fully below. For example, for a<br>
forming structure made according to predetermined dimensions of male protrusions, e.g.,<br>
protrusions 2250 shown in FIG. 11 below, on which hair-like fibrils 225 are to be formed can<br>
have known dimensions. If precursor film 120 is fully and permanently deformed over protrusions<br>
2250, then h and d can be calculated from these known dimensions, taking into account the<br>
thickness of the precursor film 120, including predicted and/or observed web thinning. If the<br>
precursor film 120 is not fully formed over protrusions 2250, then the height h of hair-like pillars<br>
will be less than the corresponding height of the protrusions 2250/<br>
In one embodiment the diameter of hair-like fibrils 225 is constant or decreases with<br>
increasing amplitude (amplitude increases to a maximum at closed distal end 226). As shown in<br>
FIG, 5, for example, the diameter, or average lateral cross-sectional dimension, of hair-like fibrils<br>
225 can be a maximum at proximal portion 229 and the lateral cross-sectional dimension steadily<br>
decreases to distal end 226. This structure is believed to be necessary to ensure the polymeric<br>
web 80 can be readily removed from the forming structure 350, as more fully described below<br>
with respect to FIG. 10.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, some thinning of precursor web 120 can occur due to the relatively<br>
deep drawing required to form high aspect ratio hair-like fibrils 225. For example, thinning can<br>
be observed at or near closed distal ends 226. By "observed" is meant that the thinning is distinct<br>
when viewed in magnified cross-section. Such thinning can be beneficial as the thinned portions<br>
offer little resistance to compression or shear when touched by a person's skin. For example,<br>
when a person touches the polymeric web 80 on the side exhibiting hair-like fibrils 225, the finger<br>
tips first contact closed distal ends 226 of hair-like fibrils 225. Due to the high aspect ratio of<br>
hair-like fibrils 225, and, it is believed, to the wall thinning of the film at or near the distal ends<br>
226, the hair-like fibrils offer little resistance to the compression or shear imposed on the web by<br>
the person's fingers. This lack of resistance is registered as a feeling of softness, much like the<br>
feeling of a velour fabric. In fact, it has been found that polymeric webs of the present invention<br>
can provide for a feeling of softness equal to or greater than tbat of prior art polymeric webs, such<br>
as the web disclosed in Curro '643.<br>
It should be noted that a fluid impermeable web having only the hair-like fibrils as<br>
disclosed herein, and not having macroscopic apertures, can offer softness for any application in<br>
which fluid permeability is not required. Thus, in one embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
invention can be described as a polymeric web 80 exhibiting a soft and silky tactile impression on<br>
at least one surface thereof, the silky feeling surface of the web 80 exhibiting a pattern of discrete<br>
hair-like fibrils 225, each of the hair-like fibrils 225 being a protruded extension of the web<br>
surface and having a side wall 227 defining an open proximal! portion 229 and a closed distal<br>
portion 226, the hair-like fibrils maximum lateral cross-sectional dimension at or near said open<br>
proximal portion, exhibiting a cross-sectional diameter d of between about 50 microns (about<br>
0.002 inch) to about 76 microns (about 0.003 inch), and can be at least 100 microns (0.004<br>
inches) 130 microns (0.005 inches). The hair-like fibrils can have an aspect ratio from 0.5 to 3.<br>
For disposable absorbent articles, where a topsheet having a fluid permeable, three-<br>
dimensional structure is desired, the invention can be described as a polymeric web 80 exhibiting<br>
a soft and silky tactile impression on at least one surface 90 thereof, the silky feeling surface 90 of<br>
the web exhibiting a pattern of discrete hair-like fibrils 225, each of the hair-like fibrils 225 being<br>
a protruded extension of the web surface 90 and having a side wall 227 defining an open proximal<br>
portion 229 and a closed distal portion 226, the hair-like fibrils exhibiting an average cross-<br>
sectional diameter d of between 50 microns (0.002 inches) 130 microns (0.005 inches), and an<br>
aspect ratio from at least 0.5,1,1.5,2, or 3 and wherein the web 80 further exhibits a<br>
macroscopically expanded, three-dimensional pattern of macroscopic surface aberrations, e.g.,<br>
primary apertures 71 superposed thereon, the macroscopic surface aberrations 71 being oppositely<br>
oriented from the hair-like fibrils 225, that is, the primary apertures extend from a first surface 90<br>
to a second surface 85 of polymeric web 80.<br>
The "area density" of the hair-like fibrils 225, which is the number of hair-like fibrils 225<br>
per unit area of first surface 90, can be optimized for use in absorbent articles. In general, the<br>
center-to-center spacing can be optimized for adequate tactile impression, while at the same time<br>
minimizing fiber-to-fiber entrapment of fluid. Currently, it is believed that a center-to-center<br>
spacing of about 100 microns to 250 microns (about 0.004 inch to about 0.010 inch) is optimal for<br>
use in sanitary napkins. Minimizing entrapment of menses between fibers improves the surface<br>
cleanliness of the sanitary napkin, which, in turn improves the cleanliness and skin health of the<br>
wearer.<br>
In one embodiment, "superposed thereon" means that the polymeric web appears<br>
generally as shown in FIQ. 3, wherein the pattern of discrete hair-like fibrils 225 is disposed on<br>
the land areas 81 of the interconnecting members only, i.e., only on the first surface 90 of web 80.<br>
However, conceptually, it is contemplated that "superposed thereon" could also cover an<br>
embodiment (not shown) in which the pattern of discrete hair-like fibrils 225 extends into<br>
macroapertures 71, for example on side walls 83 of the interconnecting members.  In other<br>
embodiments, hair-like fibrils 225 are disposed only in certain predetermined regions of web 80.<br>
For example, a topsheet for a sanitary napkin can have a central region having hair-like fibrils<br>
225, and the remainder of the topsheet being free from hair-like fibrils 225.<br>
Precursor web 120 can be any polymeric film having sufficient material properties to be<br>
formed into the web of the present invention by the hydroforrning process described herein. That<br>
is, precursor web 120 must have sufficient yield properties such that the precursor web 120 can be<br>
strained without rupture to an extent to produce hair-like fibrils 225 and, in the case of a three-<br>
dimensional, macroscopically-apertured, formed film, rupture to form macroapertures 71. As<br>
disclosed more fully below, process conditions such as temperature can be varied for a given<br>
polymer to permit it to stretch with or without rupture to form the web of the present invention.<br>
In general, therefore, it has been found that preferred starting [materials to be used as the precursor<br>
web 120 for producing the web 80 of the present invention exhibit a low yield and high-<br>
elongation characteristics. In addition, the starting films preferably strain harden. Examples of<br>
films suitable for use as the precursor web 120 in the present invention include films of low<br>
density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), and blends of linear<br>
low-density polyethylene and low density polyethylene (LDPE/LLDPE).<br>
Precursor web 120 must also be sufficiently deformable and have sufficient ductility for<br>
use as a polymeric web of the present invention. The term "deformable" as used herein describes<br>
a material which, when stretched beyond its elastic limit, will! substantially retain its newly<br>
formed conformation.<br>
One material found suitable for use as a precursor web 120 of the present invention is<br>
DOWLEX 2045A polyethylene resin, available from The Dow Chemical Company, Midland, MI,<br>
USA.  A film of mis material having a thickness of 20 microns can have a tensile yield of at least<br>
12 MPa; an ultimate tensile of at least 53 MPa; an ultimate elongation of at least 635%; and a<br>
tensile modulus (2% Secant) of at least 210 MPa (each of the above measures determined<br>
according to ASTM D 882).<br>
Precursor web 120 can be a laminate of two or more webs, and can be a co-extruded<br>
laminate. For example, precursor web 120 can comprise two layers as shown in FIG. 4, and<br>
precursor web 120 can comprise three layers, wherein the inner most layer is referred to as a core<br>
layer, and the two outermost layers are referred to as skin layers. In one embodiment precursor<br>
web 120 comprises a three layer coextruded laminate having an overall thickness of about 25<br>
microns (0.001 in.), with the core layer having a thickness of about 18 microns (0.0007 in.); and<br>
each skin layer having a thickness of about 3.5 microns (0.00015 in.). In general, for use as a<br>
topsheet in sanitary napkins, precursor web 120 should have an overall thickness (sometimes<br>
referred to as caliper) of at least about 10 microns and less than about 100 microns. The thickness<br>
of precursor web 120 can be about 15 microns, 20 microns, 25 microns, 30 microns, 35 microns,<br>
40 microns, 45 microns, or 60 microns. In general, the ability to form high area density (or low<br>
average center-to-center spacing C) hair-like fibrils 225 on web 80 is limited by the thickness of<br>
precursorweb 120. For example, it is believed that the center-to-center spacing C of two adjacent<br>
hair-like fibrils 225 should be greater than twice the thickness of precursor web 120 to permit<br>
adequate and complete three-dimensional web formation between adjacent protrusions 2250 of<br>
forming structure 350 as disclosed more fully below.<br>
The precursor web 120 preferably comprises a surfactant. In a three layer laminate, the<br>
core layer can comprise a surfactant while the outer layers are initially devoid of surfactants.<br>
Preferred surfactants include those from non-ionic families such as: alcohol ethoxylates,<br>
alkylphenol ethoxylates, carboxylic acid esters, glycerol esters, polyoxyethylene esters of fatty<br>
acids, polyoxyethylene esters of aliphatic carboxylic acids related to abietic acid, anhydrosorbitol<br>
esters, etyhoxylated anhydrosorbitol esters, ethoxylated natural fats, oils, and waxes, glycol esters<br>
of fatty acids, carboxylic amides, diethanolamine condensates, and polyalkyleneoxide block<br>
copolymers. Molecular weights of surfactants selected for the present invention may range from<br>
about 200 grams per mole to about 10,000 grams per mole. Preferred surfactants have a<br>
molecular weight from about 300 to about 1,000 grams per mole.<br>
The surfactant level initially blended into precursor web 120 (or optionally the core layer<br>
in a three layer laminate) can be as much as 10 percent by weight of the total multilayer structure.<br>
Surfactants in the preferred molecular weight range (300-1,000 grams/mole) can be added at<br>
lower levels, generally at or below about 5 weight percent of the total multilayer structure.<br>
The precursor web 120 can also comprise titanium dioxide in the polymer blend.<br>
Titanium dioxide can provide for greater opacity of the finished web 80. Titanium dioxide can be<br>
added at up to about 10 percent by weight to low density polyethylene for blending into the<br>
precursor web 120 material.<br>
Other additives, such as particulate material, e.g., calcium carbonate (CaC03), particulate<br>
skin treatments or protectants, or odor-absorbing actives, e.g., zeolites, can be added in one or<br>
more layers of precursor web 120. In some embodiments, webs 80 comprising particulate matter,<br>
when used in skin-contacting applications, can permit actives to contact the skin in a very direct<br>
and efficient manner. Specifically, in some embodiments, formation of hair-like fibrils 225 can<br>
expose particulate matter at or near the distal ends thereof. Therefore, actives such as skin care<br>
agents can be localized at or near distal ends 226 to permit direct skin contact with such skin care<br>
agents when the web 80 is used in skin contacting applications.<br>
The precursor web 120 can be processed using conventional procedures for producing<br>
multilayer films on conventional coextruded film-making equipment Where layers comprising<br>
blends are required, pellets of the above described components can be first dry blended and then<br>
melt mixed in the extruder feeding that layer. Alternatively, if insufficient mixing occurs in the<br>
extruder, the pellets can be first dry blended and then melt mixed in a pre-compounding extruder<br>
followed by repelletization prior to film extrusion. Suitable methods for making precursor web<br>
120 are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,520,875, issued to Wnuk et al. on May 28,1996 and U.S.<br>
Pat No. 6,228,462, issued to Lee et al. on May 8,2001; both patents the disclosure of which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
A fluid pervious polymeric web of the present invention can be utilized as a topsheet on a<br>
catamenial device, such as a sanitary napkin. For example, a polymeric web 80 of the present<br>
invention exhibiting a macroscopically expanded, three-dimensional pattern of macroscopic<br>
surface aberrations in the form of primary apertures 71 combines softness properties with<br>
excellent fluid rewet properties (i.e., reduced fluid rewet compared to previous webs, such as the<br>
web of Curro'643).<br>
FIG. 7 is a top plan view of a sanitary napkin 20 with portions cut away to more clearly<br>
show the construction of the napkin 20, including topsheet 22, which can comprise a polymeric<br>
web 80 of the present invention. It should be understood that the polymeric web 80 of the present<br>
invention can also be utilized in other absorbent articles such as pantyliners, interlabial devices,<br>
diapers, training pants, incontinent devices, wound dressings and the like. It also should be<br>
understood, that the present invention is not limited to the particular type or configuration of the<br>
sanitary napkin 20 shown in FIG 7, which is simply a representative non-limiting example.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8, the sanitary napkin 20 has two surfaces, a body-facing surface 20a<br>
and an opposed garment-facing surface 20b. The body-facing surface 20a is intended to be worn<br>
adjacent to the body of the wearer. The garment-facing surface 20b is intended to be placed<br>
adjacent to the wearer's undergarments when the sanitary napkin 20 is worn.<br>
The sanitary napkin 20 has two centerlines, a longitudinal centerline "1" and a transverse<br>
centerline "t". The term "longitudinal", as used herein, refers to a line, axis or direction in the<br>
plane of the sanitary napkin 20 that is generally aligned with (e.g., approximately parallel to) a<br>
vertical plane which bisects a standing wearer into left and right body halves when the sanitary<br>
napkin 20 is worn. The terms "transverse" or "lateral" as usedherein, are interchangeable, and<br>
refer to a line, axis or direction which lies within the plane of the sanitary napkin 20 that is<br>
generally perpendicular to the longitudinal direction.<br>
As shown in FIG. 7, the sanitary napkin 20 comprises a liquid pervious topsheet 22,<br>
which can comprise web 80 of the present invention, a liquid impervious backsheet 23 joined with<br>
the liquid pervious topsheet 22, and an absorbent core 24 positioned between the liquid pervious<br>
topsheet 22 and the liquid impervious backsheet 23. FIG. 7 also shows that the sanitary napkin 20<br>
has a periphery 30 which is defined by the outer edges of the sanitary napkin 20 in which the<br>
longitudinal edges (or "side edges") are designated 31 and the end edges (or "ends") are<br>
designated 32.<br>
Sanitary napkin 20 preferably includes optional sidefkps or "wings" 34 that can be folded<br>
around the crotch portion of the wearer's panties. The side flaps 34 can serve a number of<br>
purposes, including, but not limited to protecting the wearer's panties from soiling and keeping the<br>
sanitary napkin secured to the wearer's panties.<br>
FIG. 8 is a cross-sectional view of the sanitary napkin taken along section line 8â€”8 of<br>
FIG. 7. As can be seen in FIG. 8, the sanitary napkin 20 preferably includes adhesive fastening<br>
means 36 for attaching the sanitary napkin 20 to the undergarment of the wearer. Removable<br>
release liners 37 cover the adhesive fastening means 36 to keep the adhesive from sticking to a<br>
surface other than the crotch portion of the undergarment prio^ to use. In addition to having a<br>
longitudinal direction and a transverse direction, the sanitary napkin 20 also has a "z"direction or<br>
axis, which is the direction proceeding down through the liquid pervious topsheet 22 and into<br>
whatever fluid storage core 24 that may be provided. A continuous path between the liquid<br>
pervious topsheet 22 and underlying layer or layers of the articles herein permits fluid to be drawn<br>
in the "z" direction and away from the topsheet of the article into its ultimate storage layer. In<br>
some embodiments, the continuous path will have a gradient Of increasing capillary attraction,<br>
which facilitates fluid flow down into the storage medium.<br>
In FIG. 9 there is shown single-phase web process for debossing and drying (if necessary)<br>
a continuous polymeric web 80 of the present invention. By single-phase is meant that the<br>
process uses only one three-dimensional forming structure. By continuous is meant to distinguish<br>
the described process from a batch process in which individual, discrete samples of web are made,<br>
often referred to as hand sheets. "While it is recognized that webs of the present invention can be<br>
batch-processed using the structures described for the continuous process, a continuous process is<br>
the preferred method for commercially making a polymeric web of the present invention. Further,<br>
while the process described with respect to FIG. 9 is primarily designed to form macroscopically-<br>
expanded webs having hair-like fibrils 225 and primary apertures, e.g., apertures 71 of web 80, it<br>
is believed that a hydroforming process can be utilized to form a web having only hair-like fibrils<br>
by suitably modifying the forming structure to have only protrusions 2250.<br>
Polymeric web 80 of the present invention can be formed by a hydroforming process on a<br>
single three-dimensional forming structure 350 and can also be annealed and/or dried on the<br>
forming structure 350 prior to rewinding the web into roll stock for further processing. The three-<br>
dimensional structures of a polymeric web, e.g., polymeric web 80 shown in FIG. 4, are formed<br>
by forcing the web to conform to the forming structure 350, which rotates about stationary<br>
forming drum 518. Forming structure 350 is described more fully below, but, in general, it is a<br>
three-dimensional form to which the precursor web 120 is forced to conform.<br>
Precursor web 120 can be extruded and chilled immediately prior to being fed directly<br>
onto the surface of forming structure 350, or it can be fed froni a supply roll, as shown by supply<br>
roll 501 in FIG. 9. In some embodiments it is preferred that the temperature of the precursor web<br>
120 be elevated sufficiently to soften it and make it more conformable to the forming structure<br>
350. The temperature of precursor web 120 can be elevated by applying hot air or steam to the<br>
web or by passing the web through heated nip rolls, prior to subjecting it to the forming process.<br>
In the process described in FIG. 9, precursor web 120 is fed in a substantially planar<br>
condition in the machine direction (MD) from a supply roll 501 onto the surface of forming<br>
structure 350. Forming structure 350 rotates at a speed such that the tangential surface velocity of<br>
the forming structure 350 substantially matches that of the linear velocity of precursor web 120 in<br>
the machine direction, so that during the hydroforming process the web is substantially stationary<br>
relative to forming structure 350.<br>
Once precursor web 120 is adjacent to and being "carried on", so to speak, the forming<br>
structure 350, precursor web 120 is directed over stationary vacuum chamber 520 which is<br>
interior to forming drum 518. Although the hydroforming process described herein can be<br>
accomplished to some degree without vacuum chambers, in general, vacuum chambers aid in<br>
better three-dimensional web formation as well as liquid removal. As precursor web 120 passes<br>
over vacuum chamber 520, the outwardly-exposed surface of precursor web 120 is impinged upon<br>
by a liquid jet 540 discharged from high pressure liquid jet nozzle 535 between a pair of<br>
stationary liquid baffles 525 and 530 which served to help localize splashing liquid. The effect of<br>
the liquid jet 540 is to cause the precursor web to conform to forming structure 350. As precursor<br>
web conforms to forming structure 350, both the hair-like fibrils 225 and the primary apertures 71<br>
can be formed. As primary apertures 71 form, vacuum from vacuum chamber 520 aids in<br>
removing excess liquid from the web, and, in some cases aids in forming precursor web 120 to<br>
forming structure 350. As precursor web 120 is passed under the influence of high pressure liquid<br>
jet 540, it is permanently deformed to conform to the forming structure 350, thereby being formed<br>
into three-dimensional, macroscopically-expanded polymeric web 80 of the present invention.<br>
In the process described with reference to FIG. 9, a single liquid jet 540 is described as<br>
forming both the hair-like fibrils 225 and the primary apertures 71. In another embodiment,<br>
additional liquid (or fluid) jets can be used to form the three-dimensional web structures in<br>
multiple stages. For example, a first fluid, such as water, can impinge precursor web 120 to form<br>
macroapertures 71 in a first stage, and following the first stage, a second fluid, such as hot water<br>
or air (optionally in combination with a vacuum chamber) can impinge the partially-formed web<br>
to further form the hair-like fibrils 225 in a second stage.<br>
In the process described in FIG. 9, liquid jets 540 and/or drying means 590 can be<br>
replaced by re-heat means. Re-heat means refers to means for directing streams of heated gases,<br>
such as air, such that the heated air, alone or in combination with vacuum from vacuum chambers<br>
520 or 555, is sufficient to cause precursor web 120 to conform to forming structure 350. Re-heat<br>
means are known in the art, for example as disclosed in US Pat. No. 4,806,303 issued to Bianco et<br>
al. In general, a re-heat means comprises an air blower and a heater as well as a nozzle to direct<br>
forced, heated air onto the surface of a web. In one embodiment the air exiting the nozzle can be<br>
between 220 and 305 degrees centigrade and the precursor web 120 can be moved under or across<br>
the heated air stream at about 25 meters per minute. In one embodiment vacuum can be<br>
maintained at about 365 mm Hg. In embodiments where re-heat means replaces liquid jets 540,<br>
drying means S90 are not necessary, but can be utilized if desired, for example as annealing<br>
means or further forming means.<br>
Without being bound by theory, it is believed that by adjusting the precursor web<br>
properties, the vacuum dwell time, i.e., the time precursor web is adjacent vacuum chambers 520<br>
and/or 555, and/or the level of vacuum, i.e., partial pressure, it is possible to form web 80 on the<br>
apparatus shown in FIG. 9 in a cast process without using any liquid jets 540. That is, by suitably<br>
adjusting the precursor web properties, e.g., thickness, material, temperature, vacuum alone is<br>
sufficient to form a web 80 that conforms to forming structure 350. In a cast process precursor<br>
web 120 is extruded directly onto the surface of forming structure 350 such that web 80 formation<br>
can occur prior to cooling of precursor web 120.<br>
In general, therefore, one fluid (e.g., water or air) or more than one fluid (e.g., water, air)<br>
can be directed to impinge on, and do energetic work on, precursor web 120 in one or more<br>
stages. It is believed that, for thermoplastic precursor webs 120, as the temperature of the<br>
precursor web approaches its melting point, it more easily stretches without rupture to form over<br>
protrusions 2250 of forming structure 350. However, for forming macroapertures it is more<br>
desirable to have relatively high strain rates and relatively rapid rupture, and for forming hair-like<br>
fibrils it is more desirable to have relatively low strain rates and no rupture. Accordingly, in a<br>
two-stage forming process, the temperature of the impinging fluid at first and/or second stages<br>
can be adjusted independently, depending on the dwell time over which each impingement acts<br>
and the temperature of the precursor web 120 to form both macroapertures 71 and high aspect<br>
ratio hair-like fibrils 225 independently.<br>
For making webs suitable for use as a topsheet in a disposable absorbent article, precursor<br>
web 120 can be a polyolefinic film from about 10 microns to about 100 microns in total thickness.<br>
For such precursor webs 120, high pressure liquid jet 540 is typically water at a temperature from<br>
about 15-95 degrees C, operated at a pressure in the range of about 200 psig to about 1200 psig<br>
and a water flow rate in the range of about 18 liters (4 gallons) per minute to about 62 liters (14<br>
gallons) per minute per 25.4 cross-machine direction (CD) mm (1 inch) of width of the precursor<br>
web 120.<br>
After passing beyond the high pressure liquid jet 540, (or jets, as discussed above),<br>
polymeric web 80 of the present invention can be dried while still on forming structure 350.  For<br>
example, as shown in FIG. 9, polymeric web 80 can be directed, while still on forming structure<br>
350, under the influence of drying means 590. Drying means 590 can be any of means for<br>
removing, or driving off liquids from polymeric webs, such as radiant heat drying, convective<br>
drying, ultrasonic drying, high velocity air knife drying, and the like. In general, a drying<br>
medium 600 can be utilized, such as heated air, ultrasonic waves, and the like. A stationary<br>
vacuum chamber 555 can be utilized to aid in drying by means of a partial pressure inside<br>
forming drum 518. Drying means 590 can be designed to drive liquid off of polymeric web 80<br>
and into vacuum chamber 555. Baffles 570 and 580 can be utilized to locally contain any liquid<br>
that gets removed and does not enter vacuum chamber 555. Baffles 570 and 580 can also serve to<br>
localize and direct heat or heated air used for drying.<br>
Using a heated drying medium 600 has an additional benefit for making webs 80 of the<br>
present invention. Prior art macroscopically-expanded, three-dimensional polymeric webs, such<br>
as the webs disclosed in the aforementioned Curro '643, are dried in a separate process after being<br>
removed form their respective forming structures. These webs are typically wound onto a roll for<br>
storage until needed for web processing of disposable articles, for example. One problem<br>
associated with prior art webs is the compression setting that occurs during winding and storage.<br>
Without being bound by theory, it is believed that three-dimensional polyethylene webs can<br>
experience a secondary crystallization over time which "locks in" the collapsed, wound state of<br>
the web. It has been found that by first annealing three-dimensional polymeric webs by<br>
subjecting them to elevated temperatures for a sufficient time, this observed compression set is<br>
reduced or prevented altogether.   In general, however, it is difficult to subject prior art webs to<br>
the requisite temperatures due to the relatively fragile structure. That is, if a prior art web is<br>
subjected to annealing temperatures, the web tends to lose me three-dimensional structure formed<br>
on the forming structure. For this reason, therefore, drying the web while still on the forming<br>
structure provides a significant processing benefit by permitting processing with sufficiently high<br>
annealing temperatures to anneal the web, while at the same time drying it The annealing<br>
temperature will vary depending on the time of drying, the polymer used and the thickness of the<br>
web, but, in general, for polyolefinic webs, a drying/annealing temperature of between about 50-<br>
250 degrees C is sufficient.<br>
After polymeric web 80 passes the drying (or drying/annealing) stage of the process it can<br>
be removed from the forming structure 350 about roller 610 and is thereafter rewound or fed<br>
directly to subsequent converting operations.<br>
A forming structure of the present invention, such as forming structure 350 referred to<br>
with respect to FIG. 9, is necessary for making a web of the present invention. The forming<br>
structure is sometimes referred to as a forming screen. FIG. 10 shows a portion of a forming<br>
structure of the present invention 350 in partial perspective view. The forming structure 350<br>
exhibits a plurality of forming structure apertures 710 defined by forming structure<br>
interconnecting members 910. Forming structure apertures 710 permit fluid ccinrnunication<br>
between opposing surfaces, mat is, between forming structure first surface 900 in the plane of the<br>
first surface 1020 and forming structure second surface 850 in the plane of the second surface<br>
1060. Forming structure sidewall portions 830 extend generally between the forming structure<br>
first surface 900 and forming structure second surface 850. Protrusions 2200 extend from<br>
forming structure first surface 900 to form generally columnar, pillar-like forms.<br>
A comparison of FIG. 10 with FIG. 3 shows the general correspondence of forming<br>
structure 350 with polymeric web 80 of the present invention. That is, the three-dimensional<br>
protrusions 2250 and depressions (e.g., apertures 710) of forming structure 350 have a one-to-one<br>
correspondence to the hair-like fibrils 225 and primary apertures 71, respectively, of polymeric<br>
web 80. The one-to-one correspondence is necessary to the extent that the forming structure 350<br>
determines the overall dimensions of the polymeric web 80 of the present invention. However,<br>
the distance between plane of the first surface 102 and plane of the second surface 106 of the<br>
polymeric web 80 need not be the same as the distance between the plane of the first surface 1020<br>
and the plane of the second surface 1060 of forming structure 350. This is because the distance<br>
"T" for polymeric web 80, as shown in FIG. 5, is not dependent upon the actual thickness of<br>
forming structure 350, the thickness being the perpendicular distance between the plane of the<br>
first surface 1020 and the plane of the second surface 1060 of forming structure 350.<br>
FIG. 11 is a further enlarged, partial perspective view of the forming structure 350 shown<br>
in FIG. 10, and compares with the similar view of polymeric web 80 in FIG. 4. Protrusions 2250<br>
can be made by methods described below to extend from first surface 900 to a distal end 2260.<br>
As shown in the further enlarged view of FIG. 12, protrusions 2250 can have a height hp<br>
measured from a minimum amplitude measured from first surface 900 between adjacent<br>
protrusions to distal end 2260. Protrusion height hp can be at least about 50 microns (about 0.002<br>
inch) and can be at least about 76 microns (about 0.003 inch), and can be at least about 152<br>
microns (about 0.006 inch), and can be at least about 250 microns (about 0.010 inch), and can be<br>
at least about 381 microns (about 0.015 inch). Protrusions 2250 have a diameter dp, which for a<br>
generally cylindrical structure is the outside diameter. For non-uniform cross-sections, and/or<br>
non-cylindrical structures of protrusions 2250, diameter dp is measured as the average cross-<br>
sectional dimension of protrusions at Vz the height hp of the protrusions 2250, as shown in FIG.<br>
12. Protrusion diameter dp can be about 50 microns (about 0.002 inch), and can be at least about<br>
66 microns, and can be about 76 microns (about 0.003 inch), and can be at least about 127<br>
microns (about 0.005 inch). Thus, for each protrusion 2250, a protrusion aspect ratio, defined as<br>
hp/dp, can be determined. Protrusions 2250 can have an aspect ratio hp/dp of at least 1, and as<br>
high as 3 or more. The aspect ratio can be at least about 5 and can be about 6. In one<br>
embodiment, protrusions had a substantially uniform diameter of about 66 microns over a height<br>
of about 105 microns, for an aspect ratio of about 1.6. The protrusions 2250 can have a center-to-<br>
center spacing Cp between two adjacent protrusions 2250 of between about 100 microns (about<br>
0.004 inch) to about 250 microns (about 0.010 inch). In one embodiment the center-to-center<br>
spacing was 179 microns. In general, it is believed that the actual distance between two adjacent<br>
protrusions 2250 (i.e., a "side-to-side" dimension) should be greater than twice the thickness t of<br>
precursor web 120 to ensure adequate deformation of precursor web 120 between adjacent<br>
protrusions 2250.<br>
In general, because the actual height hp of each individual protrusion 2250 may vary, an<br>
average height hpaTg of a plurality of protrusions 2250 can be determined by determining a<br>
protrusion average minimum amplitude Ap,*, and a protrusion average maximum amplitude<br>
Apmax over a predetermined area of forming structure 350. Likewise, for varying cross-sectional<br>
dimensions, an average protrusion diameter dp^vg can be determined for a plurality of protrusions<br>
2250. Such amplitude and other dimensional measurements can be made by any method known<br>
in the art, such as by computer aided scanning microscopy and related data processing.<br>
Therefore, an average aspect ratio of the protrusions 2250, ARpaVg for a predetermined portion of<br>
the forming structure 350 can be expressed as hpavg/dpavg The dimensions hp and dp for<br>
protrusions 2250 can be indirectly determined based on the known specifications for making<br>
forming structure 350, as disclosed more fully below.<br>
In one embodiment the diameter of protrusions 2250 is constant or decreases with<br>
increasing amplitude. As shown in FIG. 12, for example, the diameter, or largest lateral cross-<br>
sectional dimension, of protrusions 2250 is a maximum near first surface 900 and steadily<br>
decreases to distal end 2260. This structure is believed to be necessary to ensure that the<br>
polymeric web 80 can be readily removed from the forming structure 350.<br>
Forming structure 350 can be made of any material that can be formed to have protrusions<br>
2250 having the necessary dimensions to make a web of the present invention, is dimensionally<br>
stable over process temperature ranges experienced by forming structure 350, has a tensile<br>
modulus of at least about 5 MPa, more preferably at least about 10M Pa, more preferably at least<br>
about 30 MPa more preferably at least about 100-200 MPa, and more preferably at least about<br>
400 MPa, a yield strength of at least about 2 MPa, more preferably at least about 5 MPa more<br>
preferably at least about 10 MPa, more preferably at least about IS MPa, and a strain at break of<br>
at least about 1%, preferably at least about 5%, more preferably at least about 10%. It has been<br>
found mat relatively tall, high aspect ratio protrusions form better webs as the modulus of the<br>
material of the forming structure increases, as long as it has sufficient strain at break (i.e., not too<br>
brittle) so as not to break. For modulus and yield strength data, values can be determined by<br>
testing according to known methods, and can be tested at standard TAPPI conditions at a strain<br>
rate of 100%/minute.<br>
Dimensional stability with respect to thermal expansion is necessary only for commercial<br>
processes as described with respect to FIG. 9, because for some process conditions the forming<br>
structure 350/forming drum 518 interface can be compromised if the forming structure 350<br>
expands or contracts more than the forming drum 518. For batch processing of polymeric webs<br>
of the present invention dimensional stability is not a requirement. However, for all commercial<br>
processes it is necessary that the forming structure be made of a material suitable for the<br>
processing temperature ranges. Process temperature ranges are affected by process conditions<br>
including the temperature of the fluid jet, e.g., liquid jet 540, and the temperature of forming<br>
structure 350, which can be heated, for example. In general, for polyolefinic webs, including<br>
laminated, co-extruded films for use in webs for disposable absorbent articles (i.e., films having a<br>
thickness, t, of about 10-100 microns), a water temperature of between IS degrees C and 95<br>
degrees C can be used. The drying/annealing air temperature can be 2S0 degrees C or less. In<br>
general, process temperatures can be varied throughout a wide range and still make the polymeric<br>
web 80 of the present invention. However, the temperature ranges can be varied to make<br>
polymeric web 80 at optimal rates depending on film thickness, film type, and line speed.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, protrusions 2250 are made integrally with forming structure<br>
350. That is, the forming structure is made as an integrated structure, either by removing material<br>
or by building up material. For example, forming structure 350 having the required relatively<br>
small scale protrusions 2250 can be made by local selective removal of material, such as by<br>
chemical etching, mechanical etching, or by ablating by use of high-energy sources such as<br>
electrical-discharge machines (EDM) or lasers.<br>
Acid etching of steel structures as disclosed in the aforementioned Ahr '045 patent, is<br>
believed to be only capable of making protrusions having an aspect ratio of 1 or less. Without<br>
being bound by theory it is believed that acid etching steel in small, incremental steps may be<br>
result in the high aspect ratios preferred in a forming structure of the present invention, but it is<br>
expected that the resulting protrusion(s) would be severly undercut to have "mushroom" shaped<br>
profiles. It is not currently known by the inventors of the present invention how one might acid<br>
etch steel as taught in Ahr '045 to form the generally cylindrical protrusions 2250 of the present<br>
invention having the requisite aspect ratio. Likewise, forming protrusions on steel by<br>
electroplating is believed to result in "mushroom" shaped protrusions. In bom instances, i.e., acid<br>
etching and electroplating, the mushroom shape is expected due to the nature of the material<br>
removal/deposition. Material would not be removed/deposited only in a general aligned, e.g.,<br>
vertical manner. Therefore, it is currently known to make metal forming structures 350 only by<br>
use of electrical-discharge machines (EDM) or lasers.<br>
A portion of a prototype forming structure 350 made of steel and having protrusions 2250<br>
made by a conventional EDM process is shown in FIGS. 13 and 14. FIG 13 is a photomicrograph<br>
of a forming structure 350 and FIG. 14 is a further enlarged view the forming structure of FIG.<br>
13. As shown in FIG. 13, a steel forming structure has been subjected to an EDM process to form<br>
integral protrusions 2250 having distal ends 2260. The forming structure 350 shown in FIGS. 13<br>
and 14 has depressions 710 generally similarly shaped to those shown in FIG. 3. However, as can<br>
be seen in FIGS. 13 and 14, the structure is less than ideal for making topsheets for absorbent<br>
articles because of the geometrical constraints of both the forming structure 350 prior to the EDM<br>
process, and the EDM process itself. Specifically, as can be seen, first surface 900 of forming<br>
structure interconnecting members 910 is only one protrusion "wide". Also, as can be seen in<br>
FIG. 13, due to the geometrical constraints of the process of EDM, gaps between protrusions 2250<br>
can result. For example, gap 901 in FIG. 13 resulted from the EDM wire being oriented slightly<br>
off parallel from the respective forming structure interconnecting members 910 shown.<br>
Therefore, for commercially successful production of webs suitable for topsheets in disposable<br>
absorbent articles, the forming structure shown in FIG. 13 may not be acceptable. However, it is<br>
clear that suitably shaped protrusions 2250 having the required aspect ratios can be formed. The<br>
protrusions 2250 of the forming structure shown in FIG. 13 have an average height hp,avg of about<br>
275 microns (0.011 inch), and an average diameter of about dpavgof about 100 microns (0.004<br>
inch), defining an average aspect ratio of ARpavg of about 2.7. (Note that the forming screen<br>
shown in FIGS. 13 and 14 is a prototype, and has been processed by EDM on both sides. In<br>
practice, it is only necessary to form protrusions on one side.)<br>
In another method of making forming structure 350, a base material susceptible to laser<br>
modification is laser "etched" to selectively remove material to form protrusions 2250 and<br>
forming structure apertures 710. By "susceptible to laser modification" means that the material<br>
can be selectively removed by laser light in a controlled manner, recognizing that the wavelength<br>
of light used in the laser process, as well as the power level, may need to be matched to the<br>
material (or vice-versa) for optimum results. Currently known materials susceptible to laser<br>
modification include thermoplastics such as polypropylene, acetal resins such as DELRINÂ® from<br>
DuPont, Wilmington DE, USA, thermosets such as crosslinked polyesters, or epoxies, or even<br>
metals such as aluminum or stainless steel.<br>
In one embodiment a forming structure can be laser machined in a continuous process.<br>
For example, a polymeric material such as DELRINÂ® can be provided in a cylindrical form as a<br>
base material having a central longitudinal axis, an outer surface, and an inner surface, the outer<br>
surface and inner surface defining a thickness of the base material. A moveable laser source can<br>
be directed generally orthogonal to the outer surface. The moveable laser source can be moveable<br>
in a direction parallel to the central longitudinal axis of the base material. The cylindrical base<br>
material can be rotated about the central longitudinal axis while the laser source machines, or<br>
etches, the outer surface of the base material to remove selected portions of the base material in a<br>
pattern that defines a plurality of protrusions. Each protrusion can be the generally columnar and<br>
pillar-like protrusions 22S0, as disclosed herein. By moving the laser source parallel to the<br>
longitudinal axis of the cylindrical base material as the cylindrical base material rotates, the<br>
relative movements, i.e., rotation and laser movement, can be synchronized such that upon each<br>
complete rotation of cylindrical base material a predetermined pattern of protrusions can be<br>
formed in a continuous process similar to "threads" of a screw.<br>
FIG. 15 is a photomicrograph of laser-etched embodiment of a forming structure 350 of<br>
the present invention. FIG. 16 is an enlarged view of another, but similar, forming structure 350<br>
of the present invention. The forming structures 350 shown in FIGS. 15 and 16 are made by first<br>
forming a polymer layer having formed therein depressions 710, which as shown are generally<br>
"teardrop" shaped and would make generally teardrop shaped primary apertures 71 in web 80 of<br>
the present invention. The depressions 710 can be formed, for example, by laser etching the<br>
depressions first The polymer layer having depressions 710 therein can also be formed by<br>
radiating a liquid photosensitive resin such as a UV-light-curable polymer, through an appropriate<br>
masking layer on an underlying support layer (not shown) such as a foraminous woven backing.<br>
Suitable polymer layers, support layers, masking layers and UV-curing processes are well known<br>
in the art of making paper-making belts and are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,334,289 issued to<br>
Trokhan et al., on August 2,1994; and U.S. Pat No. 4,529,480 issued to Trokhan on July 16,<br>
1985; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,010,598 issued to Boutilier et al. on Jan. 4,2000, each of these patents,<br>
being hereby incorporated herein by reference for the teaching of structures, resins and curing<br>
techniques. As disclosed in the Boutilier '598 patent, for example, one suitable liquid<br>
photosensitive resin composition is comprised of four components: a prepolymer; monomers;<br>
photoinitiator and antioxidants. A preferred liquid photosensitive resin is Merigraph L-055<br>
available from MacDermid Imaging Technology, Inc. of Wilmington, Del.<br>
After the polymer layer is cured to have depressions 710 the polymer layer is laser etched<br>
to form protrusions 2250 having distal ends 2260. Laser etching can be achieved by known laser<br>
techniques, selecting wavelength, power, and time parameters as necessary to produce the desired<br>
protrusion dimensions. In the forming structure of FIG. 16, protrusions have an average height<br>
hp of 250 microns and an average diameter dp of 85 microns (at Vz height hp) and an aspect ratio<br>
arp of about 2.9.<br>
Therefore, as disclosed above, in one embodiment, depressions 710 can be made in one<br>
manner, and the protrusions in another, by a separate process. For example, depressions 710 can<br>
be preformed in a forming structure "blank" that is subsequently laser machined, i.e., etched, to<br>
have protrusions formed on the land areas between depressions 710. In one embodiment, forming<br>
structure 350 formed as a cured polymer on a support layer can be used as is, with the support<br>
layer being a part of forming structure 350. However, in another embodiment, the cured polymer<br>
can be removed from the support layer and used alone. In this case, it may be desirable to only<br>
partially cure the polymer, remove the support layer 903 and finish fully curing the polymer<br>
material.<br>
A web 80 made on the forming structure shown in FIG. 15 is shown in the<br>
photomicrographs of FIGS. 17 and 18. FIG. 17 is a photomicrograph of a portion of web 80<br>
showing hair-like fibrils 225 and aperture 71. FIG. 18 is a further enlarged view of web 80<br>
showing in more detail hair-like fibrils 225 having closed distal ends 226. The precursor web 120<br>
for the web 80 shown in FIGS. 17 and 18 was made from a 25 micron (0.001 inch) thick Dowlex<br>
2045A precursor film 120.<br>
FIGS. 19 and 20 show greatly enlarged portions of webs 80 made in batch processes on<br>
the forming structure shown in FIGS. 13 and 14 to more closely show details of hair-like fibrils<br>
225. The polymer webs 80 shown in FIGS. 19 and 20 have primary apertures 71 (not shown)<br>
generally in a pentahexagon shape, each having a projected area in the first surface 90 of about<br>
1.4 square millimeters. The spacing between primary apertures 71 is such that the open area<br>
primary apertures 71 as projected in the first surface 90 is up to 65% of total surface area. The<br>
web 80 exhibits about 4,650 hair-like fibrils 225 per square centimeter of first surface 90 area<br>
(about 30,000 hair-like fibrils 225 per square inch). This concentration of hair-like fibrils 225 is<br>
referred to as the "density" or "area density" of hair-like fibrils 225, and represents the number of<br>
hair-like fibrils per unit area of first surface 90, as opposed to total area of polymer web 80. Thus,<br>
the regions of polymer web 80 corresponding to primary apertures 71 do not contribute to the area<br>
when calculating density. In general, the density is determined by the average center-to-center<br>
spacing of the protrusions 2250 on forming structure 350, which is about ISO microns (0.006<br>
inch) for the forming structure shown in FIGS. 13 and 14.<br>
It is believed that a polymer web 80 of the present invention suitable for use as a topsheet<br>
on a disposable absorbent article (e.g., a sanitary napkin) should have a density of hair-like fibrils<br>
225 of at least about 1550 per square centimeter (about 10,000 per square inch). The density of<br>
hair-like fibrils 225 can be about 2325 per square centimeter (about 15,000 per square inch), and<br>
can be about 3100 per square centimeter (about 20,000 per square inch) and can be about 3875<br>
per square centimeter (about 25,000 per square inch).  Since for some webs it may be difficult to<br>
determine exactly where first surface 90 begins and ends, density can be approximated by taking<br>
total area of a predetermined portion of polymer web 80 and subtracting out the area of primary<br>
apertures 71 as projected in the first surface 90 of that predetermined portion. The area of<br>
primary apertures 71 can be based on the projected area of the depressions 710 of forming<br>
structure 350. By "projected area" is meant the area of a surface if it were projected onto a plane<br>
parallel to that surface, and can be imagined by analogy, for example, as an "ink stamp" of the<br>
surface.<br>
FIG. 19 is a photomicrograph of a web 80 made from a 25 micron (0.001 inch)<br>
DOWLEXÂ® 2045 A precursor film 120: As shown, the web 80 of FIG. 19 comprises discrete<br>
hair-like fibrils 225, each of the hair-like fibrils 225 being a protruded extension of first surface<br>
90. Each of the hair-like fibrils 225 has a side wall 227 defining an open portion 229 (as shown in<br>
FIG. 5) and a closed distal portion 226. The hair-like fibrils 225 shown have a height of about<br>
211 microns, and a diameter at Vi their height of about 142 microns, resulting in an aspect ratio of<br>
about 1.5.<br>
The web 80 of FIG. 20 comprises discrete hair-like fibrils 225, each of the hair-like fibrils<br>
225 being a protruded extension of first surface 90. Each of the hair-like fibrils 225 has a side<br>
wall 227 defining an open portion 229 (as shown in FIG. 5) and a closed distal portion 226. The<br>
hair-like fibrils 225 shown in FIG. 20 have an aspect ratio AR of at least 1.<br>
The difference between the webs 80 shown in FIGS. 19 and 20 is that the precursor film<br>
120 used to make the polymeric web 80 shown in FIG. 20 was a coextruded four layer<br>
polyethylene film comprising calcium carbonate in one of the outermost layers. Specifically, the<br>
calcium carbonate was added into the polymer melt for the polymer that forms the first surface of<br>
web 80 after formation of hair-like fibrils 225. The four layers comprised polyethylene in the<br>
follow order (1) ExxonMobil NTX-137 at about 42 volume percent; (2) ExxonMobil Exact 4151<br>
at about 16 volume percent; (3) ExxonMobil Exact 4049 at about 32 volume percent; and (4) a<br>
mixture of 57 weight percent Ampacet 10847 with calcium carbonate blended in as a master batch<br>
and 43 weight percent ExxonMobil LD 129, this mixture at a volume percent of about 10 percent<br>
The precursor film 120 had a starting thickness of about 25 microns (0.001 inch).<br>
One interesting and unexpected result of using a CaCG3/PE blend for a skin layer of<br>
precursor film 120 is the formation of regions of roughened outer surfaces 228 at or near the distal<br>
end 226 of hair-like fibrils 225 as can be seen on the web shown in FIG. 20. These regions of<br>
relatively greater surface roughness 228, which have less surface smoothness than the<br>
surrounding surfaces, such as first surface 90, provide for a more cloth-like appearance due to its<br>
inherent low gloss, and an even greater soft and silky tactile impression. Without being bound by<br>
theory, it is believed mat the relatively roughened surface texture of the distal ends of hair-like<br>
fibrils 225 gives greater texture that is experienced as softness to the skin of a person touching the<br>
surface. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the formation of roughened outer<br>
surfaces at or near the distal end 226 of hair-like fibrils 225 is a result of deep drawing precursor<br>
web having therein particulate matter. It appears that possibly the particulate matter, in this case<br>
CaC03, causes stress concentrations in the film blend that give rise to surface discontinuities. At<br>
the points of maximum strain, i.e., at the point of maximum draw of hair-like fibrils 225, the<br>
surface of the film (i.e., precursor film 120) breaks up, exposing particulate matter on the surface<br>
of the hair-like fibrils 225.<br>
Therefore, in one embodiment polymer web 80 can be described as having hair-like<br>
fibrils 225 in which at least a portion near the distal end 226 thereof exhibits regions of relatively<br>
greater surface roughness 228 than the remaining portions. By using different additive particulate<br>
matter, the regions of relatively greater surface roughness 228 can provide for other benefits. For<br>
example, particulate skin treatments or protectants or odor-absorbing actives can be used.<br>
Importantly, webs 80 comprising particulate matter permit actives to be delivered to the skin of a<br>
wearer of an article using web 80 in a very direct and efficient manner.<br>
In general, it is believed that any non-diffusing ingredient (particulate and non-<br>
particulate) blended into the melt of a polymer of precursor web 120 can be exposed upon strain<br>
of the polymer near the distal end of hair-like fibrils 225.   Specifically, actives such as skin care<br>
agents can be localized substantially at or near distal ends 226 which can be the primary skin<br>
contact surfaces for web 80. Other known methods of imparting localized strain to polymeric<br>
films can also serve to expose non-diffusing ingredients in layers. For example, embossing, ring<br>
rolling, thermovacuum forming, and other known processes can provide for localized rupture and<br>
exposure of active ingredients of polymer films.<br>
Other methods of making forming structure 350 include building up the structure by way<br>
of localized electroplating, 3-D deposition processes, or photoresist techniques. One 3-D<br>
deposition process is a sintering process. Sintering is similar to stereo lithography in which layers<br>
of powdered metal are built up to produce a final work piece. However, it is believed that<br>
sintering processes may be limited in resolution. Photoresist techniques include forming a three<br>
dimensional structure by use of an appropriate mask over a liquid photosensitive resin, such as<br>
the UV-curable polymer disclosed above. UV curing is effective at curing only the portions of a<br>
liquid resin exposed to UV light from a UV light source. The remaining (uncured) portions of the<br>
liquid resin can then be washed off, leaving behind only the cured portions. The liquid resin UV-<br>
curable polymer can be placed on a tray, for example, to a desired depth or thickness and<br>
appropriately masked and UV light-cured to selectively cure the portions to be protrusions 2250<br>
and to not cure the portions that will be the apertures 710.<br>
In another embodiment, a flexible polymeric forming structure 350 as shown in FIGS. 21<br>
and 22 can be formed from the polymerization of a UV-curable polymer on an air-permeable<br>
backing screen 430. First surface 900 defines apertures 710 which, in the illustrated embodiment<br>
are hexagons in a bilaterally staggered array. It is to be understood that, as before, a variety of<br>
shapes and orientations of apertures 710 can be used. FIG. 22 illustrates a cross sectional view of<br>
that portion of forming structure 350 shown in FIG. 28 as taken along line 22-22. Machine<br>
direction reinforcing strands 420 and cross direction reinforcing strands 410 are shown in both<br>
FIGS. 21 and 22. Together machine direction reinforcing strands 420 and cross direction<br>
reinforcing strands 410 combine to form a foraminous woven element 430. One purpose of the<br>
reinforcing strands is to strengthen the flexible polymeric forming structure 350. As shown,<br>
reinforcing strands 410 and 420 can be round and can be provided as a square weave fabric<br>
around which the UV-curable resin has cured. Any convenient filament size in any convenient<br>
weave can be used, although, in general, (he more open the weave the better. A more open weave<br>
generally results in better air flow through the apertures 710. Better air flow results in better, i.e.,<br>
more economical, hydroforming when forming structure 350 is used to form a polymeric web,<br>
such as polymeric web 80. In one embodiment forming structure 350 430 is a metal screen, such<br>
as is commonly used on household doors and windows. In one embodiment the metal screen is an<br>
18X16 mesh bright aluminum screening having a filament diameter for both machine direction<br>
filaments 420 and cross direction filaments 410 of 0.24 mm, available as Hanover Wire Cloth<br>
from Star Brand Screening, Hanover, PA, USA, having.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 21 and 22, protrusions 2250 extend from first surface 900 and have<br>
distal ends 2260 that are generally rounded in shape. In another embodiment, as shown in the<br>
photomicrograph of FIG. 26, the distal ends can be generally flattened into a plateau.    The<br>
forming structure shown in FIG. 26 is a flexible polymeric forming structure formed by a two-<br>
stage process of polymerizing a UV-curable resin.<br>
One two-stage method for making flexible polymeric forming structure 350, such as the<br>
forming structure shown in FIGS. 24-26, is described with reference to FIG. 23. The method<br>
described herein makes forming structures 350 having a combination of relatively large openings,<br>
i.e., depressions 710, and relatively fine protrusions, i.e., protrusions 2250. In the preferred<br>
embodiment illustrated in FIG. 23, the method described herein makes continuous belted forming<br>
structures 351. In broad outline, the method involves using a photosensitive resin to construct in<br>
and about a foraminous element a solid, polymeric framework which delineates the preselected<br>
patterns of the relatively large depressions 710 and relatively fine protrusions 2250 of forming<br>
structure 350 (or belted forming structure 351).  More particularly, the method comprises a two<br>
stage resin casting process including the steps of:<br>
a.	Applying a backing film to the working surface of a forming unit;<br>
b.	Juxtaposing a foraminous element to the backing film so that the backing film is<br>
interposed between the foraminous element and the forming unit;<br>
c.	Applying a coating of liquid photosensitive resin to the surfaces of the foraminous<br>
element;<br>
d.	Controlling the thickness of the coating to a preselected value;<br>
e.	Juxtaposing in contacting relationship with the coating of photosensitive resin a mask<br>
comprising both opaque and transparent regions where the opaque regions define a<br>
preselected pattern corresponding to depressions 710;<br>
f.	Exposing the liquid photosensitive resin to light having an activating wavelength<br>
through the mask thereby inducing at least partial curing of the photosensitive resin in<br>
those regions which are in register with the transparent regions of the mask; and<br>
g.	Removing from the composite foraminous element/partially cured resin substantially<br>
all the uncured liquid photosensitive resin;<br>
h.   Repeating one time steps a-g with a different controlled thickness (e.g., a greater<br>
thickness, such as a thickness corresponding to hÂ£2 in FIG. 22) in step (d) and a<br>
different mask in step (e), the mask in step (e) comprising both opaque and<br>
transparent regions where the transparent regions define a preselected pattern<br>
corresponding to protrusions 2250;<br>
L    Immersing the foraminous element/cured resin in qn oxygen-free environment such as<br>
a water bath or other aqueous solution;<br>
j.    Exposing the foraminous element/partially cured resin to light having an activating<br>
wavelength through the mask thereby inducing full curing of the photosensitive resin,<br>
resulting in the finished belted forming structure.<br>
The exact apparatus (or equipment) used in the practice of the present invention is<br>
immaterial so long as it can, in fact, be used to practice the present invention. After reading the<br>
whole of the following description, one of ordinary skill of the art will be able to select<br>
appropriate apparatus to perform the steps indicated above. A preferred embodiment of an<br>
apparatus which can be used in the practice of this invention to construct a forming structure in<br>
the form of an endless belt is shown in schematic outline in FIG. 23. For convenience, the<br>
invention will be described in terms of that apparatus.<br>
The first step of the process is applying a backing film to the working surface of a<br>
forming unit.  In FIG. 23, forming unit 613 has working surface 612 and is indicated as being a<br>
circular element; it is preferably a rotatable drum. The diameter of the forming unit 613 and its<br>
length are selected for convenience. Its diameter should be great enough so that the backing film<br>
and the foraminous element are not unduly curved during the process. It must also be large<br>
enough in diameter that there is sufficient distance of travel about its surface so that the necessary<br>
steps can be accomplished as the forming unit 613 is rotating. The length of the forming unit 613<br>
is selected according to the width of the forming structure 350 being constructed. Forming unit<br>
613 is rotated by a drive means not illustrated. Optionally, and preferably, working surface 612<br>
absorbs light of the activating wavelength.  Preferably, forming unit 613 is provided with means<br>
for insuring that backing film 653 is maintained in close contact with working surface 612.<br>
Backing film 653 can be, for example, adhesively secured to working surface 612 or forming unit<br>
613 can be provided with means for securing backing film 653 to working surface 612 through<br>
the influence of a vacuum applied through a plurality of closely spaced, small orifices across<br>
working surface 612 of forming unit 613. Preferably, backing film 653 is held against working<br>
surface 612 by tensioning means not shown in FIG. 23.<br>
Backing film 653 can be introduced into the system from backing film supply roll 631 by<br>
unwinding it therefrom and causing it to travel in the direction indicated by directional arrow D3.<br>
Backing film 653 contacts working surface 612 of forming unit 613, is temporarily constrained<br>
against working surface 612 by the means discussed hereinbefore, travels with forming unit 613<br>
as the latter rotates, is eventually separated from working surface 612, and travels to backing film<br>
take-up roll 632 where it is rewound.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 23, backing film 653 is designed for a single use<br>
after which it is discarded. In an alternate arrangement, backing film 653 can take the form of an<br>
endless belt traveling about a series of return rolls where it is cleaned as appropriate and reused.<br>
Necessary drive means, guide rolls, and the like are not illustrated in FIG. 23.  The function of<br>
the backing film 653 is to protect the working surface 612 of the forming unit 613 and to facilitate<br>
removal of the partially cured forming structure 350 from the forming unit The film can be any<br>
flexible, smooth, planar material such as polyethylene or polyester sheeting. Preferably, the<br>
backing film 653 is made from polypropylene and is from about 0.01 to about 0.1 millimeter<br>
(mm) thick.<br>
The second step of the process is the juxtaposing of a foraminous element 601 to the<br>
backing film in such a way that the backing film is interposed between the foraminous element<br>
601 and the forming unit 613.  The foraminous element 601 is the material about which the<br>
curable resin is constructed. One suitable foraminous element is a metal wire screen 430 as<br>
illustrated in FIGS. 21 and 22. Screens having polyester filaments are suitable. Screens having<br>
mesh sizes from of about 6 to about 30 filaments per centimeter are suitable. Square weave<br>
screens are suitable as are screens of other, more complex weaves. Filaments having either round<br>
or oval cross sections are preferred. Although advantageous, it is not necessary that the filaments<br>
be transparent to light of the activating wave-length.  In addition to screens, foraminous elements<br>
can be provided by woven and nonwoven fabrics, papermaking fabrics, thermoplastic netting, and<br>
the like. The precise nature of the foraminous element selected and its dimensions will be dictated<br>
by the use in which the forming structure 350 will be placed after it is constructed.   Since the<br>
forming structure 350 constructed by the apparatus illustrated in FIG. 23 is in the form of an<br>
endless belt, foraminous element 601 is also an endless belt, formed, for example, by seaming<br>
together the ends of a length of screening.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 23, foraminous element 601 travels in the direction indicated by<br>
directional arrow Dl about return roll 611 up, over, and about forming unit 613 and about return<br>
rolls 614 and 615. Other guide rolls, return rolls, drive means, support rolls and the like can be<br>
utilized as necessary, and some are shown in FIG. 23.  Foraminous element 601 is juxtaposed<br>
backing film 653 so that backing film 653 is interposed between foraminous element 601 and<br>
forming unit 613. The specific design desired for the forming structure 350 will dictate the exact<br>
method of juxtaposition. In the preferred embodiment, foraminous element 601 is placed in direct<br>
contacting relation with backing film 653.<br>
When the liquid photosensitive resin 652 is applied to foraminous element 601 from<br>
source 620, the resin 652 will be disposed principally to one side of foraminous element 601 and<br>
foraminous element 601 will, in effect, be located at one surface of the forming structure 350.<br>
Foraminous element 601 can be spaced some finite distance from backing film 653 by any<br>
convenient means, but such arrangement is not usually preferred.  Resin source 620 can be a<br>
nozzle, or any of known means for depositing liquid photosensitive resin, including extrusion, slot<br>
coating, and the like.<br>
The third step in the process of this invention is the application of a first layer of coating<br>
of liquid photosensitive resin 652 to the foraminous element 601. The first layer of coating is the<br>
layer that will ultimately comprise the portion of forming structure 350 between the planes of the<br>
first and second surfaces, 1020 and 1060, respectively (shown as bil in FIG. 22).  Any technique<br>
by which the liquid material can be applied to the foraminous element 601 is suitable. For<br>
example, nozzle 620 can be used to supply viscous liquid resin. It is necessary that liquid<br>
photosensitive resin 652 be evenly applied across the width of foraminous element 601 prior to<br>
curing and that the requisite quantity of material be applied so as to enter the openings of the<br>
foraminous member 601 as the design of the forming structure 350 requires. For woven<br>
foraminous elements the knuckles, i.e., the raised cross-over points of a woven screen structure,<br>
are preferably in contact with the backing film, so that it will likely not be possible to completely<br>
encase the whole of each filament with photosensitive resin; but as much of each filament as<br>
possible should be encased.<br>
Suitable photosensitive resins can be readily selected from the many available<br>
commercially. They are materials, usually polymers, which cure or cross-link under the influence<br>
of radiation, usually ultraviolet (UV) light) References containing more information about liquid<br>
photo-sensitive resins include Green et al, "Photocross-linkable Resin Systems", J. Macro-Sci.<br>

Technology", Tappi Paper Synthetics Conf. Proa, Sept. 25-27,1978, pp. 167-172; and Schmidle,<br>

preceding three references are incorporated herein by reference. Especially preferred liquid<br>
photosensitive resins are included in the Merigraph L-055 series of resins made by MacDcrmid<br>
Imaging Technology Inc., Wilmmgtion, DE, USA USA.<br>
The next step in the process of this invention is controlling the thickness of the coating to<br>
a preselected value. The preselected value corresponds to the thickness desired for the forming<br>
structure 350 between first and second surfaces 1020 and 1060, respectively. That is, the<br>
thickness hfi as shown in FIG. 22. When the forming structure 350 is to be used to make the web<br>
80 suitable for use as a topsheet in a disposable absorbent article, it is preferred that hfl be from<br>
about 1 mm to about 2 mm thick. Other applications, of course, can require thicker forming<br>
structures 350 which can be 3 mm thick or thicker.<br>
Any suitable means for controlling the thickness can be used. Illustrated in FIG. 23 is the<br>
use of nip roll 641. The clearance between nip roll 641 and forming unit 613 can be controlled<br>
mechanically by means not shown. The nip, in conjunction with mask 654 and mask guide roll<br>
641, tends to smooth the surface of liquid photosensitive resin 652 and to control its thickness.<br>
The fifth step in the process of the invention comprises juxtaposing a first mask 654 in<br>
contacting relation with the liquid photosensitive resin 652. The purpose of the mask is to shield<br>
certain areas of the liquid photosensitive resin from exposure to light. First mask 654 is<br>
transparent to activating wavelengths of light, e.g., UV light, except for a pattern of opaque<br>
regions corresponding to the pattern of apertures 71 desired in the forming structure 350. A<br>
portion of a suitable first mask 654 showing one pattern of opaque, i.e., shaded, portions 657 and<br>
light-transparent portions 658 is shown in FIG. 27. Note that FIG. 27 shows a measuring scale<br>
superimposed thereunder. The smallest increment of the scale shown is 0.1 mm.<br>
The light-transparent portions 658 of first mask 654, i.e., the areas that are not shielded<br>
from the activating light source correspond to those areas of liquid photosensitive resin that will<br>
be cured to form the connecting members 910 of forming structure 350. Likewise, the opaque<br>
portions 657 of first mask 654 correspond to pattern of the depressions 710 of forming structure<br>
350. First mask 654, can, therefore, have opaque portions 657 corresponding to the partem of<br>
hexagon-shaped depressions of forming structure 350 shown in FIG. 21, or the pentagonal-shaped<br>
depressions 710 shown in FIG. 13, or the teardrop-shaped depressions 710 shown in FIG. 15. In<br>
general, for a forming structure 350 used to form a web 80 for use as a topsheet in a disposable<br>
absorbent article, the opaque portions 657 of first mask 654 should be of a suitable size, shape,<br>
and spacing to provide the necessary structure of apertures 71 for web 80 such that it exhibits<br>
desirable fluid flow properties.<br>
First mask 654 can be any suitable material which can be provided with opaque and<br>
transparent regions. A material in the nature of a flexible film is suitable. The flexible film can be<br>
polyester, polyethylene, or cellulosic or any other suitable material. The opaque regions can be<br>
formed by any convenient means such as photographic or gravure processes, flexographic<br>
processes, and inkjet or rotary screen printing processes. First mask 654 can be an endless loop or<br>
belt (the details of which are not shown) or it can be supplied from one supply roll and transverse<br>
the system to a takeup roll, neither of which is shown in the illustration. First mask 654 travels in<br>
the direction indicated by directional arrow D4, turns under nip roll 641 where it is brought into<br>
contact with the surface of liquid photosensitive resin 652, travels to mask guide roll 642 in the<br>
vicinity of which it is removed from contact with the resin. In this particular embodiment, the<br>
control of the thickness of the resin and the juxtaposition of the mask occur simultaneously.<br>
The sixth step of the process of this invention comprises exposing the liquid<br>
photosensitive resin 652 to light of an activating wavelength through the first mask 654 thereby<br>
inducing at least partial curing of the resin in those regions which are in register with the<br>
transparent regions 658 of first mask 654. The resin need not be fully cured in this step, but at<br>
least partial curing is achieved when exposed resin retains its desired shape during post-light-<br>
exposure steps, such as washing away non-cured resin, as described below. In the embodiment<br>
illustrated in FIG. 23, backing film 653, foraminous element 601, liquid photosensitive resin 652,<br>
and mask 654 all form a unit traveling together from nip roll 641 to the vicinity of mask guide roll<br>
642. Intermediate nip roll 641 and mask guide roll 642 and positioned at a location where backing<br>
film 653 and foraminous element 601 are still juxtaposed forming unit 613, liquid photosensitive<br>
resin 652 is exposed to light of an activating wavelength as supplied by exposure lamp 655.<br>
Exposure lamp 655 is selected to provide ulumination primarily within the wavelength which<br>
causes curing of the liquid photosensitive resin. That wavelength is a characteristic of the liquid<br>
photosensitive resin. In a preferred embodiment the resin is UV-light curable and exposure lamp<br>
655 is a UV light source. Any suitable source of illumination, such as mercury arc, pulsed xenon,<br>
electrodeless, and fluorescent lamps, can be used.<br>
As described above, when the liquid photosensitive resin is exposed to light of the<br>
appropriate wavelength, curing is induced in the exposed portions of the resin. Curing is generally<br>
manifested by a solidification of the resin in the exposed areas. Conversely, the unexposed<br>
regions remain fluid. The intensity of the illumination and its duration depend upon the degree of<br>
curing required in the exposed areas. The absolute values of the exposure intensity and time<br>
depend upon the chemical nature of the resin, its photo characteristics, the thickness of the resin<br>
coating, and the pattern selected. Further, the intensity of the exposure and the angle of incidence<br>
of the light can have an important effect on the presence or absence of taper in the walls of<br>
connecting members 910 through the thickness hfl of forming structure 350.  Accordingly, the<br>
light can be collimated to achieve the desired degree of taper.<br>
The seventh step in the process is removing from the cured or partially-cured composite<br>
of foraminous element/partly cured resin 621 substantially all of the uncured liquid photosensitive<br>
resin. That is to say, the resin which has been shielded from exposure to light is removed from the<br>
system.  In the embodiment shown in FIG. 23, at a point in the vicinity of mask guide roll 642,<br>
first mask 654 and backing film 653 are physically separated from the composite comprising<br>
foraminous element 601 and the now partly cured resin 621. The composite of foraminous<br>
element 601 and partly cured resin 621 travels to the vicinity of first resin removal shoe 623. A<br>
vacuum is applied to one surface of the composite at first resin removal shoe 623 so that a<br>
substantial quantity of the liquid (uncured) photosensitive resin is removed from the composite.<br>
As the composite travels farther, it is brought into the vicinity of resin wash shower 624 and resin<br>
wash station drain 625 at which point the composite is thoroughly washed with water or other<br>
suitable liquid to remove more of the remaining liquid (uncured) photosensitive resin, which is<br>
discharged from the system through resin wash station drain 625. The wash shower is preferably<br>
primarily water or an aqueous solution at a temperature above about 115 degrees F.<br>
A second resin removal shoe 626 (or a third, etc., as necessary) can be used for further<br>
removal of residual un-cured resin at this stage of the process. (A second curing station in the<br>
form of a second light source 660 and an air-displacing medium, such as water bath 630, is shown<br>
in FIG. 23 but is not used in the first stage of the process.)<br>
At this stage of the process for making forming structure 350, which is the end of the first<br>
stage, the composite now comprises essentially foraminous element 601 and the partially-cured<br>
resin 621 that represents the portion of forming structure 350 comprising connecting elements<br>
910, first surface 900 and second surface 850 and depressions 710.<br>
The next step is to form protrusions 2250 on the partially-formed forming structure 350.<br>
To form protrusions 2250, the process is essentially repeated in a second stage, and with a second<br>
mask 656 replacing first mask 654.<br>
Therefore, step eight starts with partially formed forming structure, denoted as 603 in<br>
FIG. 23 advancing in the direction indicated by directional arrow Dl about return roll 611 up,<br>
over, and about forming unit 613 and about return rolls 614 and 615. As before, other guide rolls,<br>
return rolls, drive means, support rolls and the like can be utilized as necessary, and some are<br>
shown in FIG. 23.  Partially formed forming structure 603 is juxtaposed backing film 653 so that<br>
backing film 653 is interposed between partially formed forming structure 603 and forming unit<br>
613. The specific design desired for the forming structure 350 will dictate the exact method of<br>
juxtaposition. In the preferred embodiment, partially formed forming structure 603 is placed in<br>
direct contacting relation with backing film 653. Backing film 653 can be the same backing film<br>
referred to previously for the first stage of the process.<br>
In the ninth step of the process a second coating of liquid photosensitive resin 652 is<br>
again applied as discussed above to partially formed forming structure 603 from source 620, the<br>
resin 652 being applied to fill the depressions, i.e., depressions 710, of partially formed forming<br>
structure 603 and, in addition, apply a coating above the level of partially cured resin of partially<br>
formed forming structure 603. As before, partially formed forming structure 603 can be spaced<br>
some finite distance from backing film 653 by any convenient means, but such arrangement is not<br>
usually preferred.<br>
The second layer of coating is the layer will ultimately be cured to form the protrusions<br>
2250 of forming structure 350.   If uniform heights of protrusions 2250 are desired, it is necessary<br>
that the second layer of liquid photosensitive resin 652 be evenly applied across the width of<br>
partially formed forming structure 603. A requisite quantity of photosensitive resin to form<br>
protrusions 2250 is enough so as to fill the openings of the partially formed forming structure 603<br>
and to over fill to a preselected thickness corresponding to the desired protrusion height, such as a<br>
thickness corresponding to distance hf2 of FIG. 22. When the forming structure 350 is to be used<br>
to make the web 80 suitable for use as a topsheet in a disposable absorbent article, it is preferred<br>
that hÂ£2 be from about 1.1 mm to about 2.1 mm thick. As before, any suitable means for<br>
controlling the thickness can be used, including the use of nip roll 641.<br>
The tenth step in the process illustrated in FIG. 23 comprises juxtaposing a second mask<br>
656	in contacting relation with the second layer of liquid photosensitive resin 652. As before, the<br>
purpose of the mask is to shield certain areas of the liquid photosensitive resin from exposure to<br>
light A portion of a suitable first mask 654 showing one pattern of opaque, i.e., shaded, portions<br>
657	and light-transparent portions 658 is shown in FIG. 28. Note that, although difficult to see,<br>
FIG. 28 shows a measuring scale superimposed thereunder. The smallest increment of the scale<br>
shown is 0.1 mm.<br>
As shown in FIG. 28, second mask 656 is opaque to activating wavelengths of light, e.g.,<br>
UV light, except for a pattern of transparent regions 658 corresponding to the pattern of<br>
protrusions 2250 desired in the forming structure 350. the light-transparent portions of second<br>
mask 656, i.e., the areas that are not shielded from the activating light source correspond to those<br>
areas of liquid photosensitive resin that will be cured. Therefore, the transparent regions of<br>
second mask 656 correspond to the preselected pattern of the protrusions 2250 of forming<br>
structure 350. Second mask 656, can, therefore, have a pattern of transparent regions being<br>
closely-spaced spots or dots, which spots or dots have a one-to-one correspondence to the closely-<br>
spaced, round (in cross-section) protrusions, such as those shown in FIGS. 24 and 25.  The<br>
pattern of transparent regions of mask 656 can, of course, be other shapes and patterns, depending<br>
on the particular end use of forming structure 350. In general, for a forming structure 350 used to<br>
form a web 80 for use as a topsheet in a disposable absorbent article, the transparent regions 658<br>
of second mask 656 should be of a suitable size, shape, and spacing to provide the necessary<br>
structure of protrusions 2250 for web 80 such that it exhibits desirable tactile properties, such as<br>
perceived softness. In one embodiment, transparent regions 658 of second mask 656 are each<br>
circular with a diameter of about 65 microns, spaced apart on a center-to-center distance of about<br>
188 microns, in a uniform spacing of about 3875 transparent regions 658 per square centimeter<br>
(about 25,000 per square inch).<br>
Second mask 656 can be the same material as first mask 654 such as a flexible film in<br>
which the opaque regions can be applied by any convenient means such as photographic or<br>
gravure processes, flexographic processes, and inkjet or rotary screen printing processes. Second<br>
mask 656 can be an endless loop (the details of which are not shown) or it can be supplied from<br>
one supply roll and transverse the system to a takeup roll, neither of which is shown in the<br>
illustration. Second mask 656 travels in the direction indicated by directional arrow D4, turns<br>
under nip roll 641 where it is brought into contact with the surface of liquid photosensitive resin<br>
652, travels to mask guide roll 642 in the vicinity of which it is removed from contact with the<br>
resin. In this particular embodiment, the control of the thickness of the resin and the juxtaposition<br>
of the mask occur simultaneously.<br>
The eleventh step of the process comprises again exposing the liquid photosensitive resin<br>
652 to light of an activating wavelength through the second mask 656 thereby inducing curing of<br>
the resin in those regions which are in register with the transparent regions of second mask 656,<br>
that is, protrusions 2250. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 23, backing film 653, partially<br>
formed forming structure 603, liquid photosensitive resin 652, and second mask 656 all form a<br>
unit traveling together from nip roll 641 to the vicinity of mask guide roll 642. Intermediate nip<br>
roll 641 and mask guide roll 642 and positioned at a location Where backing film 653 and partially<br>
formed forming structure 603 are still juxtaposed forming unit 613, liquid photosensitive resin<br>
652 is exposed to light of an activating wavelength as supplied by exposure lamp 655. As before,<br>
exposure lamp 655, in general, is selected to provide illumination primarily within the wavelength<br>
which causes curing of the liquid photosensitive resin. That wavelength is a characteristic of the<br>
liquid photosensitive resin. As before, n a preferred embodiment the resin is UV-light curable<br>
and exposure lamp 655 is a UV light source (in fact, is the same light source used in the first stage<br>
of the process, described above).<br>
As described above, when the liquid photosensitive resin is exposed to light of the<br>
appropriate wavelength, curing is induced in the exposed portions of the resin. Curing is<br>
manifested by a solidification of the resin in the exposed areas. Conversely, the unexposed<br>
regions remain fluid (or partially-cured in the case of the previously-cured portions of partially<br>
formed forming structure 603).  The intensity of the illumination and its duration depend upon<br>
the degree of curing required in the exposed areas. The absolute values of the exposure intensity<br>
and time depend upon the chemical nature of the resin, its photo characteristics, the thickness of<br>
the resin coating, and the pattern selected. Further, the intensity of the exposure and the angle of<br>
incidence of the light can have an important effect on the presence or absence of taper in the walls<br>
of the protrusions 2250.  As mentioned before, a light collimator can be utilized to reduce<br>
tapering of the walls.<br>
The twelfth step in the process is again removing from the partially-cured forming<br>
structure 350 substantially all of the uncured liquid photosensitive resin. That is to say, the resin<br>
which has been shielded from exposure to light in the second curing step is removed from the<br>
system.  In the embodiment shown in FIG. 23, at a point in the vicinity of mask guide roll 642,<br>
second mask 656 and backing film 653 are physically separated from the now partly cured resin<br>
621 which now includes partially- or substantially fully-cured resin of the completed forming<br>
structure 350, i.e., having both depressions 710 and protrusions 2250. The partly cured resin 621<br>
travels to the vicinity of first resin removal shoe 623. A vacuum is applied to one surface of the<br>
composite at first resin removal shoe 623 so that a substantial quantity of the liquid (uncured)<br>
photosensitive resin, as well as cured "protrusions" adjacent depressions 710, is removed from the<br>
composite.  Note that in the second curing step, second mask 656 does not limit curing of resin<br>
only on portions corresponding to first surface 900 of forming structure 350. The second curing<br>
step actually cures "protrusions" uniformly across the entire area of partially cured composite<br>
603. However, only portions of cured resin over connecting members 910 join to connecting<br>
members 910 at first surface 900 and become essentially integral with the previously-cured resin<br>
portions. Thus, in the vacuum and water washing steps, the portions of cured resin corresponding<br>
to "protrusions" that are in the adjacent depressions 710 are simply removed to prior to a final<br>
light-exposure for final curing, as described more fully below.<br>
As the composite travels farther, it is brought into me vicinity of resin wash shower 624<br>
and resin wash station drain 625 at which point the composite is thoroughly washed with water or<br>
other suitable liquid to remove substantially all of the remaining liquid (uncured) photosensitive<br>
resin, as well as any cured resin not forming part of the finished forming structure 350, all of<br>
which is discharged from the system through resin wash station drain 625 for recycling or<br>
disposal. For example, cured resin formed in the second stage light activation in the regions of<br>
the depressions are washed away. Such cured resin is preferably non-adhered to the underlying<br>
foraminous member, and, if adhered, the level of adhesion is preferably insufficient to prevent the<br>
unwanted cured material to wash away.<br>
After substantially all of the uncured resin is removed and the remaining resin is in the<br>
final form for forming structure 350, the remaining resin is fully cured by a second light source<br>
660, preferably in an oxygen free medium, such as water bath 630. The oxygen free medium<br>
ensures that oxygen does not interfere with the final UV-light curing of the remaining uncured<br>
resin. Oxygen can slow down or stop chain growth in free radical polymerization.<br>
As shown in FIG. 23 a series of guide roll 616 can be used as required to guide the<br>
partially-formed forming structure 350 into a water bath 630. However, in practice, any process<br>
configuration can be used, including simply letting the partially-formed forming structure 350 be<br>
immersed in shallow, e.g., 25.4 mm deep, water tray by its own weight. The final exposure of the<br>
resin to activating light 660 ensures complete curing of the resin to its fully hardened and durable<br>
condition.<br>
The above-described twelve-step, two-stage process continues until such time as the<br>
entire length of foraminous element 601 has been treated and converted into the forming structure<br>
350.  The finished forming structure, denoted as belted forming structure 351, can then be used in<br>
a web forming process, such as the process described with reference to FIG. 29, for example.<br>
Therefore, in general, curing can be done in stages, so that first a negative mask having<br>
UV blocking portions corresponding to forming structure apertures 710 (having UV blocking<br>
portions in a pattern of teardrops, for example), can be used to first partially cure the polymer by<br>
directing a UV light source orthogonal to the mask for a sufficient amount of time. Once the<br>
polymer is partially cured in the unmasked areas, a second mask comprising a plurality of closely<br>
spaced UV-transparent spots or dots can be placed between the light source and the partially cured<br>
polymer. The polymer is again cured by UV-light to fully cure the portions of the polymer that<br>
will be the protrusions 2250. Once the protrusions are fully cured, the remaining uncured<br>
polymer (and partially cured polymer) can be removed to leave a forming structure having similar<br>
characteristics as those shown in FIGS 22 -26. The procedure described can be used for<br>
prototyping hand sheets of material, for example.<br>
Example of Formation of BeltedForming Structure:<br>
The forming structure 350 shown in FIGS 24-26 was made according to the process<br>
described above with respect to FIG. 23. m partifcular, foraminbus element 601 was an 18X16<br>
mesh bright aluminum screening available from Hanover Wire Cloth Star Brand Screening,<br>
Hanover, PA. The screening was approximately 0.5 mm (0.021 inches) thick, 61 cm (24 inches)<br>
wide and comprised a woven mesh of filaments, each filament having filament diameter of about<br>
0.24 mm. The screening was about 15 meters (50 feet) long and was formed into an endless belt<br>
by a sewn seam.<br>
The backing film was a 0.1 mm (.004 inch) thick biaxially dear polyester film, available<br>
as Item No. R04DC30600 from Graphix, 19499 Miles Road, Cleveland, OH, USA. The<br>
photosensitive resin was XPG2003-1 purchased from MacDermid Imaging Technology Inc.,<br>
Wilmingtion, DE, USA USA which was used at room temperature as received from the<br>
manufacturer.<br>
The first mask was a 0.1 mm (.004 inch) Color Clear Film, 787N, available from Azon of<br>
Chicago EL, USA and was printed with teardrop pattern as shown in FIG. 27. The first mask was<br>
created by inkjet printing the pattern directly onto the Azon Color Clear Film.<br>
The forming unit comprised a drum about 108 cm (42.5 inches) in diameter and about 71<br>
cm (28 inches) wide. It rotated with a surface velocity of about 41 cm (16 inches) per minute.<br>
For the first cast, the photosensitive resin was applied through a nozzle to a controlled<br>
overall thickness of about 1.7 mm (0.067 inches), with the thickness being controlled by the<br>
spacing of the forming unit and nip roll as described above.<br>
The exposure lamp, i.e., lamp 655 discussed above, was a UV light system VPS/1600<br>
system, Model No. VPS-6, purchased from Fusion UV Systems, 910 Clopper Road, Gaithersburg,<br>
MD, USA. The exposure lamp was placed about 35 cm (14 inches) from the first mask and the<br>
exposure was controlled by a quartz aperture (optional, a quartz aperture helps create a uniform<br>
light density across the exposed area of the mask) which was positioned about 6.4 mm (2.5<br>
inches) from the surface of the mask, and which extended the width of the forming unit and about<br>
10 cm (4 inches) in the direction of travel (i.e., about the periphery of forming drum 613). The<br>
light was coUimated (collimator is optional but helps collimate the light for better curing<br>
resolution) through a 12.5 mm (0.5 inch) hexagonal honeycomb collimator that was 38 mm (1.5<br>
inches) tall (i.e., 38 mm long tubes having a honeycomb structure).<br>
After the first resin layer was exposed to UV light, the first mask was separated from the<br>
composite of partially-cured resin and the uncured resin was washed from the composite by an<br>
aqueous solution of water (100 gallons/per minute), Mr. CleanÂ® (0.065 gaUons/minute) and<br>
Merigraph System W6200 defoamer (0.089 gaUons/minute) at a temperature of about 115 degrees<br>
F through 4 sets of showers, each comprising a 28 inch wide manifold of 17 nozzles. Three<br>
showers sprayed from the top of the composite and one from the bottom.<br>
After the first stage the composite was partially cured, which means that the first cast of<br>
resin was not fully cured by second UV source, e.g., lamp 660 described above. The partially<br>
cured composite comprising the first cast of resin now comprised the teardrop shaped depressions<br>
710 of forming structure 350. The first cast of resin exhibited a thickness above the foraminous<br>
element of about 1.3 mm (0.050 inch). The partially cured composite was run back over the<br>
forming unit a second time in the second stage of the process. The same photosensitive resin was<br>
applied to an overall thickness of about 2 mm (0.077 inches), which was about 0.24 mm (0.010<br>
inches) thicker than the first application of resin. A second mask was used, the second mask<br>
having a pattern of small transparent circles 0.08 mm (0.003 inches) in diameter and spaced 0.18<br>
mm (0.007 inches) center-to-center in an equilateral triangle array as illustrated in FIG. 28.<br>
The composite was cured again by light source 655 as described above and subjected to<br>
the showers 624, as described above. After the showers removed substantially all of the uncured<br>
resin, the composite was post cured by directing a post-cure UV light at the composite, e.g., from<br>
source 660, while the composite was submerged in 2.5 cm (1 inch) of water containing 36 grams<br>
of sodium sulfite/gallon of water. The sodium sulfite is optional, but is a good oxygen scavenger.<br>
The post-cure UV light source was placed about 20 cm (8 inches) from the composite.<br>
The resulting belted forming structure 351 exhibited columnar-shaped pillars (i.e.,<br>
protrusions 2250) having a substantially uniform circular cross-section extending from the first<br>
surface. The protrusions each had a height about 105 microns, a diameter of about 66 microns,<br>
and a center-to-center spacing of about 188 microns. The belted forming structure 351<br>
additionally exhibited uniform teardrop-shaped depressions 710. Photomicrographs of<br>
representative portions of the belted forming structure made by the process described above are<br>
shown in FIGS. 24-26. Note that protrusions are seamless, integral extensions of the first surface<br>
of the forming structure. This is believed to be due to the polymer being only partially cured in<br>
the first stage of the process, and finally cured after formation of the protrusions.<br>
Variations on the method of forming a forming structure of the present invention utilizing<br>
the photosensitive resin-curing process described above can be made without departing from the<br>
scope of the present invention. For example, in one embodiment, the above described twelve-step<br>
process can be modified by eliminating the first mask 654, or by simply having mask 654 being<br>
completely transparent. In this embodiment, all the resin deposited in first layer, or coating, 652<br>
of UV-curable resin is partially cured to form a monolithic "slab" of partially cured resin. The<br>
remaining steps of the process are carried out as described above, including the formation of<br>
protrusions 2250 by use of second mask 656. In this manner, a forming structure is formed<br>
having protrusions 2250 but having no depressions 710. Depressions 710 can thereafter be<br>
formed by a separate process, such as by laser etching.<br>
Other methods of making forming structures are contemplated. For example, resins, such<br>
as thermally-cured (e.g., vulcanizable resins) or UV-curable resins can be partially cured (i.e.,<br>
partially polymerized) into "slabs" of material, the partial curing being sufficient to handle the<br>
slabs in a process of wrapping the slabs onto cylindrical sleeves. Once wrapped, either by spiral<br>
wrapping, or by piecing discrete slabs into a complete cylindrical form, the partially-cured resin<br>
can be fully cured, thereby forming a unitary, fully cured, cylindrical sleeve of polymerized<br>
material that can thereafter by laser etched, for example, to form depressions 710 and/or<br>
protrusions 2250. The benefit of such a process is that the cylindrical form of the forming<br>
structure can be achieved without the need to make a seam. Thus, unlike a typical belt-making<br>
process that involves a seaming step, a forming structure so made is inherently seamless.<br>
Additionally, individual layers of curable resin can be laid up in a predetermined manner such that<br>
layers having differing material properties can be arranged to form a forming structure having<br>
varying material properties throughout its thickness, for example. As an additional processing<br>
step, it may be beneficial to apply layers of uncured curable resin between layers of partially-<br>
cured resin in the layering process described above.<br>
Further, as another optional variation on the method of making a forming structure by use<br>
of partially-cured "slabs" of material on a cylindrical form, the partially-cured slabs can be<br>
layered, with the outer-most layer being a layer having formed thereon protrusions 2250. Thus,<br>
upon fully curing, the fully cured resin need only have depressions 710 formed, e.g., via laser<br>
etching, to produce the final cylindrical foraiing structure.<br>
One advantage of making a forming structure by use of partially-cured "slabs" of material<br>
placed on a cylindrical form is that the cylindrical form utilized can be part of an overall support<br>
structure for the forming structure. For example, the partially-cured slabs can be layered over a<br>
foraminous member, such as a metal or polymer screen member. Once fully cured, the partially-<br>
cured slabs can become adhered to the foraminous member, which is then a unitary part of the<br>
forming structure and can provide for strength and durability for the forming structure. Further,<br>
the partially-cured slabs can be laid up onto a relatively rigid but air-permeable membrane, such<br>
as a honeycomb membrane that can provide support and rigidity to the forming structure. Metal<br>
honeycomb structures, for example, can be provided in tubular forms, such that upon fully curing<br>
the partially-cured slabs of material, the final structure is a relatively rigid, cylindrical, air-<br>
permeable forming structure.<br>
Other methods of making forming structures are contemplated, including creation via a<br>
molding technique, in which the forming structure 350 is cast in a negative impression mold,<br>
cured, and removed. In one embodiment, a substrate, such as a polymeric substrate can be laser<br>
machined to form the negative of forming structure 350, i.e., a mold having the internal shape of<br>
forming structure 350. Once laser machined, a polymer could be directly cast into the mold (with<br>
appropriately-applied release agents, and the like, as is known in the art). The resulting forming<br>
structure 350 would have the positive shape of the mold. Alternatively, the laser-machined mold<br>
could have built up therein by electroplating, for example, a metallic forming structure 350. Also,<br>
forming structures could be formed by way of electroplating techniques, in which successive<br>
layers of material are built up into a suitable form.<br>
One of the advantages to making forming structure 350 from a flexible polymeric<br>
material, such as the material described with respect to FIGS, 15 and 24-26 is that the forming<br>
structure is flexible enough to be utilized as a continuous belt, much like a papermaking belt is<br>
used in the above-mentioned Trokhan '289 patent Such a continuous belt is referred to herein as<br>
a flexible "belted" forming structure 351. By "belted" is meant that the forming structure is in the<br>
form of a continuous, flexible band of material, much like a conveyor belt or papermaking belt, as<br>
opposed to a relatively rigid tubular drum-shaped structure, m fact, the forming structure of the<br>
present invention can be utilized as a papermaking belt in papermaking processes for making<br>
textured paper, such as tissue paper.<br>
FIG. 29 shows in simplified schematic representation one embodiment of a process for<br>
making a polymeric web 80 of the invention using a flexible belted forming structure 351. As<br>
shown, belted forming structure 351 can be a continuous belted member guided and held<br>
tensioned by various rollers, e.g., rollers 610. Belted forming structure 351 is guided over<br>
forming drum 518. While on forming drum 518 belted forming structure is supported by forming<br>
drum 518 and precursor film 120 is supported on forming structure 351. The formation of web 80<br>
on forming structure 351 proceeds the same way as described above with respect to FIG. 9 and<br>
forming drum 350.  Therefore, precursor web 120 can be subjected to liquid jet 540, (or jets) as<br>
well as drying means 590 (or drying/annealing means). However, in the process described<br>
schematically in FIG. 29, drying means 590 on forming drum 518 is optional, because drying<br>
(and/or annealing) is provided for elsewhere in the process, as described more fully below.<br>
Therefore, in the embodiment described with respect to FIG. 29, drying means 590 can be<br>
replaced by re-heat means to further form precursor web 120.<br>
In one embodiment, liquid jets 540 are not used, and the process is essentially a liquid-<br>
free process. In such a process liquid jets 540 and or drying means 590 are replaced by re-heat<br>
means as described above. Precursor film 120 is heated by reheat means that, together with<br>
vacuum if necessary, conform precursor web 120 to forming structure 351. Because no liquid is<br>
used in this process, no drying is necessary, and the drying steps disclosed herein can be<br>
eliminated.<br>
As can be seen in FIG. 29, belted forming structure 351 does not simply rotate on forming<br>
drum 518 but is guided onto and off of forming drum 518. As belted forming structure 351 is<br>
guided onto forming drum 518 it is preferably dry. After belted forming structure 351 is<br>
supported by forming drum 518, or concurrently therewith, precursor web 120 is guided over<br>
belted forming structure 351 and hydroformed as described above. After passing drying means<br>
590 the belted forming structure 351 and a three-dimensional, apertured, formed film web 80 of<br>
the present invention are guided off of forming drum 518 together. That is, polymer web 80 is<br>
intimately in contact with and supported by belted forming structure 351. This permits further<br>
processing, such as drying or annealing, if necessary, to take place while the polymer web 80 is<br>
still supported by the belted forming structure 351. In this manner, polymer web 80 can endure<br>
much greater work without collapsing, tearing, or otherwise deforming in a negative manner.<br>
Belted forming structure 351 and polymer web 80 are guided in the direction indicated in<br>
FIG. 29, i.e., the machine direction, to a through-air drying means 800. Through air drying means<br>
can be in the form of a rotating drum as shown in FIG. 29, but can be in any of other known<br>
configurations. Drying means 800 preferably utilizes air which is forced through polymer web 80<br>
and belted forming structure 351 to effect drying of the web. However, other drying means are<br>
contemplated, such as the use of capillary drying or limited orifice drying techniques common in<br>
the papermaking industry for drying paper webs.<br>
Drying means shown in FIG. 29 comprises rotating porous drying drum 802. As belted<br>
forming structure 351 and polymeric web 80 are supported by drying drum 802 a drying fluid,<br>
such as air, is forced through belted forming structure 351 and polymeric web 80. Fluid, such as<br>
air, can be forced from the outside to the inside of drying drum 802, as shown in FIG. 29, or it can<br>
be forced from the inside to the outside. In either configuration, the point is that the fluid effects<br>
drying of polymeric web 80 while web 80 remains fully supported on belted forming structure<br>
351. Drying drum dimensions, fluid flow rates, fluid moisture content, drying drum rotation<br>
velocity can all be adjusted as necessary to ensure adequate drying of polymeric web 80 prior to<br>
being guided off of drying drum 802.<br>
Drying drum 802 can have a vacuum chamber 808 to aid in fluid flow through polymeric<br>
web 80 and belted forming structure 351. Additionally, fluid removal means can be utilized to<br>
remove liquid removed from polymeric web 80. Fluid removal means can include a simple drain<br>
in forming drum 802, but can also include active removal via pumps as is known in the art to<br>
recycle water back to the hydroforming apparatus. Drying drum 802 can have a positive pressure<br>
chamber 810 which aids in removing excess moisture from the surface of forming drum 802 prior<br>
to repeating the process of supporting belted forming structure 351. Liquid removed can be<br>
simply captured in container 804 and removed appropriately, such as by draining into a water<br>
recycle system.<br>
Once polymeric web 80 and belted forming structure 351 are guided off of drying drum<br>
802, polymeric web 80 is separated from belted forming structure 351 at separation point 830.<br>
From this point polymeric web 80 may be, if necessary, subjected to additional drying, such as by<br>
radiant heat drying means 840, and likewise, belted forming structure may be subjected to<br>
additional drying means, such as forced air drying means 850. In all cases, other drying means as<br>
suitable under the processing conditions can be utilized as necessary to ensure that polymeric web<br>
80 is sufficiently dry prior to final processing into roll stock and belted forming structure 351 is<br>
