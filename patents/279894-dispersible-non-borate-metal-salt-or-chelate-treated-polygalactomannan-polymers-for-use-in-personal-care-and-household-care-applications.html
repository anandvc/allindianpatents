POLYGALACTOMANNAN POLYMERS FOR USE IN PERSONAL CARE AND<br>
HOUSEHOLD CARE APPLICATIONS<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U S Provisional Application Serial No 60/856,486, filed on November 3, 2006, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]   The present invention relates to polygalactomannan compositions and more particularly guar gum compositions which, when crosshnked with trtanate organic chelating agents, form discrete guar particles which are capable of being easily dispersed in water which permits subsequent processing of the guar such as washing  The guar and its derivative are desirable for use in applications such as personal care or household care products, and the like<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]   Polygalactomannans and their derivatives are used in various applications such as oil recovery, personal care products, textile applications, paper applications, coating applications, food applications, etc Polygalactomannans and their denvatives are difficult to disperse in aqueous solutions, as they tend to form sticky particles which clump and agglomerate, making dissolution difficult To improve dissolution of the polymers, crosslinking agents, such as borax, are used to allow for water-washing of the polygalactomannan after reaction and for improved dispersibihty of the polygalactomannan in water<br>
[0004] Crosshnking agents based on borate salts, aluminum salts, copper, iron, lead, calcium, and sodium salts have been descnbed  Other crosslinking agents<br>
such as metal salts based on titanium and zirconium have been mentioned, without clear definition of the method or procedure for their use<br>
[0005]   There exists a concern over the hazards of boron in some consumer products, and a need exists for alternative crosshnking agents for use in the purification and handling of polygalactomannan polymers and their derivatives<br>
[0006] in personal care applications, such as in hair care and skincare, and in household applications, such as fabnc care applications, there is a desire to deposit a boron free coating onto the substrate, that reduces the energy needed to move a comb through hair in the wet or dry state or delivers a silky, soft feel to skin or to fabric  This coating can also act to improve the luster and moisture retention of hair and skin, as well as their manageability and feel<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]   In a first aspect, the present invention relates to a process for producing a polygalactomannan The polygalactomannan is produced in a process compnsing the steps of obtaining a polygalactomannan and then contacting the polygalactomannan with an effective amount of a non-borate metal salt or chelate to produce a crosslinked polygalactomannan particle The preferred non-borate metal salt or chelate compnses a metal salt based on titanium or zirconium  The crosslinked polygalactomannan particle is then dispersed in water having a pH in the range of from below about 12 to about 7 and washed in the water to remove impurities from the crosslinked polygalactomannan particle<br>
[0008] In a second aspect, the present invention is directed to a personal care or household care composition compnsing a non-borate metal salt or chelate crosslinked polygalactomannan polymer and derivatives, especially titanium and zirconium crosslinked polygalactomannan containing cationic substituents This low impurity content polygalactomannan is of utility in various applications such as personal care and household care products The low impunty content polygalactomannan is of particular utility in applications where the use of boron containing compounds is to be reduced or eliminated<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009]   In the present invention, it has been found that treatment of catiomc polygalactomannan reaction mixture with titanium salts at a ratio of between about 0 001-0 025 wt trtanium/wt galactomannan polymer leads to a water-dispersible polygalactomannan that remains as a discrete particulate that does not agglomerate into a gel Other chelates, such as zirconium salts are expected to give a similar result as the titanium salts The resulting crosshnked polygalactomannan particle is easily washed in water and readily dispersible in water<br>
[0010] This application is of utility as a processing aid for galactomannans Polygalactomannans are polysacchandes composed principally of galactose and mannose units and are usually found in the endosperm of leguminous seeds such as guar, locust bean, honey locust, flame tree, and the like The polygalactomannans may be used in either their natural form or may be substituted with one or more functional groups (e g , carboxymethyl group) The most commonly used polygalactomannan is guar The guar may be undenvatized guar as well as denvatized guars such as cationic guar, anionic guar, hydrophobic guar, and hydroxyaiky! guar<br>
[0011 ]   An advantage of the use of titanate chelates over borate salts is that borate salts disassociate in water at a higher pH than titanate chelates This results in the formation of swelled gel particles or a gel mass at a higher pH   By permitting the polygalactomannan to remain as a discrete particle at lower pH values, washing of the polygalactomannan over a greater pH range may be performed and thereby permitting removal of impurities that would not be removed at the higher pH ranges, such as alkaline species These impurities may reduce the clarity of aqueous solutions of the polygalactomannan or be harmful if permitted to remain with the galactomannan in certain end use applications, such as personal care<br>
[0012]   In addition, it has been found that metal chelate, or especially titanium chelate treated cationic polygalactomannans function well as conditioning agents and thickening agents in personal care compositions<br>
[0013]   In accordance with the present invention, the cationic, anionic, hydroxalkyl, or hydrophobic polygalactomannan or denvative thereof generally has a substituent degree of substitution (DS) lower limit of about 0 001 and an upper limit of about 3 0  Preferably, the lower limit of the cationic, anionic, hydroxyalkyl, or hydrophobic DS is 0 01, and more preferably 0 05  Preferably, the upper limit of the cationic DS is 3 0, more preferably 1 0, and even more preferably 0 25  The cationic polygalactomannan or derivative thereof of the present invention generally has a weight average molecular weight (Mw) with a lower limit of about 50,000 and an upper limit of about 5,000,000 preferably, the lower limit of the molecular weight is 300,000, and more preferably 400,000 Preferably, the upper limit of the molecular weight is 1,500,000, more preferably 1,000,000<br>
[0014}   The cationic functionality of the polygalactomannan or denvatized polygalactomannan can be added to the backbone by known methods  For example, the polygalactomannan material can be reacted for a sufficient time and at a sufficient temperature with tertiary amino or quaternary ammonium alkylating reagents, such 2-dialkylaminoethyl chlonde and quaternary ammonium compounds such as 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyltnmethylammonium chlonde, and 2,3-epoxy-propyltnmethylammonium chlonde  Preferred examples include glycidyltnalkyiammonium salts and 3-halo-2-hydroxypropyltnalkylammonium salts such as giycidyltnmethylammonium chlonde, glycidyltnethylammonium chlonde, gylcidyltnpropylammonium chlonde, glycidylethyldimethylammonium chlonde, glycidyldiethylmethylammonium chlonde, and their corresponding bromides and iodides, 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyltnmethylammonium chlonde, 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyltriethylammonium chlonde, 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyltnpropylammonium chlonde, 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropylethyldimethylammonium chlonde, and their corresponding bromides and iodides, and quaternary ammonium compounds such as hahdes of imidazoline nng containing compounds<br>
[0015]   The cationic polygalactomannan may also contain other substituent groups such as nonionic substituents, i e , hydroxyalkyl wherein the alkyl represents a straight or branched hydrocarbon moiety having 1 to 30 carbon<br>
atoms (e g , hydroxyethyl, hydroxypropyl, hydroxybutyl) or anionic substituents, such as carboxymethyi groups are optional  These optional substituents are linked to the polygalactomannan polymer by the reaction with reagents such as (1) alkylene oxides (e g, ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide) to obtain hydroxyethyl groups, hydroxypropyl groups, or hydroxybutyl groups, or with (2) chloromethyl acetic acid to obtain a carboxymethyi group The process for preparing denvatized polygalactomannan is well known in the art The cationic polygalactomannan may also contain mixture of one or more other substituent groups such as nonionic, anionic and cationic substituents<br>

[0020] The above list of personal care and household care active ingredients are only examples and are not a complete list of active ingredients that can be used Other ingredients that are used in these types of products are well known in the industry  In addition to the above ingredients conventionally used, the composition according to the present invention can optionally also include, but is not limited to, ingredients such as a colorant, preservative, antioxidant, nutritional supplements, alpha or beta hydroxy acid, activity enhancer, emulsifiers, functional polymers, viscosifying agents (such as salts, i e, NaCI, NH4CI &amp; KCI, water-soluble polymers, i e , hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, and fatty alcohols, i e , cetyl alcohol), alcohols having 1-6 carbons, fats or fatty compounds, antimicrobial compound, zinc pynthione, silicone material, hydrocarbon polymer, emollients, oils, surfactants, medicaments, flavors, fragrances, suspending agents, and mixtures thereof<br>
[0021] In accordance with the present invention, examples of functional polymers that can be used in blends with the metal organic chelate treated polygalactomannan or derivatives thereof of this invention include water-soluble<br>
polymers such as acrylic acid home-polymers such as Carbopol® product and anionic and amphotenc acrylic acid copolymers, vinylpyrrolidone homopolymers and cationic vinylpyrrolidone copolymers, nonionic, cationic, anionic, and amphoteric cellulosic polymers such as hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, cationic hydroxyethylcellulose, cationic carboxymethylhydroxyethylcellulose, and cationic hydroxypropylcellulose, acrylamide homopolymers and cationic, amphoteric, and hydrophobic acrylamide copolymers, polyethylene glycol polymers and copolymers, hydrophobic polyethers, hydrophobic polyetheracetals, hydrophobically-modified polyetherurethanes and other polymers referred to as associative polymers, hydrophobic cellulosic polymers, polyethyieneoxide-propylene oxide copolymers, and nonionic, anionic, hydrophobic, amphotenc, and cationic polysacchandes such as xanthan, chitosan, alginates and gum arable<br>

to measure conditioning performance in shampoo and conditioner applications In skincare applications, skin lubricity or reduced fnction or softer feel of the skin, reduced water vapor transmission and improved skin elasticity are test methods used to measure skin conditioning  In surfactant-based household cleansing product formulations where conditioning performance is desired, such as dish detergents, fabric softeners, and antistatic products, conditioning refers to imparting a softer feel to fabnc and eliminating static effects, eliminating fabric fiber breakage or deformation known as pilling   Imparting color retention properties to fabrics is also important and can be measured<br>
[0028] The following examples demonstrate the crosslinking of catonic guar with organic titanium chelates (Tyzor®LA organic titanates, supplied by EI du Pont de Nemours and Company) and their use in personal care compositions   In addition, it has been found that titanium organic chelate treated cationic polygalactomannans function well as conditioning agents and thickening agents in personal care compositions<br>
[0029] The examples are merely set forth for illustrative purposes all parts and percentages being by weight, unless otherwise indicated it is to be understood that other modifications of the present invention can be made by<br>
skilled artisans in the related industry without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention<br>
EXAMPLES 1-6 Cationic Guar Preparation<br>
[0030] Cationic guar was prepared by known procedures, without the use of a crosshnking agent<br>
[0031] Guar splits (750g), and water (450g) were mixed in a stirred reactor under nitrogen  The reactor was pressurized with nitrogen and vented to remove oxygen  The reaction was conducted at a temperature between 30-50°C, after addition of 3-chioro-2hydroxypropyltnmethylammonium chlonde (288g), followed by 250grams 25% sodium hydroxide  The reaction was cooled to room temperature The reaction product is shown in Example 1, and it used for crosshnking expenments in Examples 3-7 in Table 1<br>
[0032] A similar reaction was conducted with addition of sodium borate tetrahydrate to crosslink the cationic guar  This reaction product is shown in Example 2<br>
Titanium Crosshnking<br>
[0033] The unpunfied cationic guar reaction product was placed in a container and the specified quantity of Tyzor® l_A organic titanates, diluted with water in Examples 3,4,5,6 is added to the splits while mixing with a hand held mixer over two minutes The reaction was conducted at ambient temperature  For Examples 4 and 6, a diluted solution of glacial acetic acid was added to the splits using the same mixing procedure, pnor to addition of the Tyzor® LA organic titanates, solution<br>
[0034] For example 7, the cationic guar reaction product was placed in an ABBE blender, with the rotational speed set at 2 (85rpm) The system was evacuated to 10 in HG and pressurized with nitrogen to 10 psi, followed by a 2 minute hold This procedure was repeated 5 times After venting, 31 9 grams Tyzor LA(50% active, E I Du Pont de Nemours, Wilmington, DE) in 369 grams water was added<br>
to the cationic guar solids(pH11 5) over 30 minutes, evacuating and pressurizing with nitrogen after each 50 ml addition The temperature was maintained at 18-22C After the final Tyzor addition, the mixture was held at 22°C and mixed for 30 minutes, under 10 psi nitrogen pressure The stirnng was stopped and the product recovered<br>
Wash Procedure<br>
[0035] A measured weight of the crosshnked or non - crosshnked polymer was placed in an 8 ounce jar and distilled water was added as specified for wash 1 in Table 1   After 30 - 40 minutes, the top water layer was decanted from the splits and measured  A second wash was performed using the specified quantity of water in Table 1, and the slurry remained at room temperature for 24 hrs<br>
[0036] if a top layer of water was present, it was decanted and measured as Wash 3 recovered   Note that there was a significant amount of water decanted from the second wash of Examples 2 (borate crosslink control), Example 5 and 6 (titanate crosslinkmg) The form of the polymer in Examples 2, 5, and 6 was as discrete particulates after Wash 2, indicating sufficient crosslinkmg had occurred to prevent polymer swelling dunng the wash step The polymer in Example 1 (no crosslinker control) formed a continuous gel plug after Wash 2, as no crosshnker was present, and the polymer was dissolving in the wash water  In Examples 3 and 4, the polymer was present as swollen, but discrete gel particles after wash 2, indicating some crosslinkmg had occurred, but an insufficient amount to prevent polymer swelling dunng the wash step<br>
[0037] Resuspension of the polymer phases in Examples 1-6 in a third wash step demonstrates that crosslinkmg occurred in Examples 2-6, with recovery of a decanted water phase and isolation of particulate polymer phase  Example 1 ' (no crosshnker control) yielded a swollen gel which continued to swell with further addition of water<br>
[0038] For Example 7, the product (660 parts by weight) was mixed with 3300 pbw water for 30-40 minutes using a mechanical stirrer The product then settled to the bottom of the beaker, and the liquid phase was decanted The solid<br>
product was dried 72hrs in a hood, with air draft, to a solids content of 87% The product was chilled with dry ice, then ground through a 0 5mm then a 0 2mm screen in a fluidized bed drier This product was then used to prepare the conditioning shampoo of Example 8 and bodywash of Example 10, in Tables 2 and 3, respectively<br>
[0039] These examples demonstrate the preparation of a water-dispersible polygalactomannan on treatment with sufficient amounts of titanium crosslinkers<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
EXAMPLE 8 AND COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES 9-10 Demonstration of Conditioning Performance of Products of the Invention<br>
[0040]   The use of the cationic polygalactomannan materials of the invention of Example 7 in a conditioning shampoo formulation is demonstrated in Example 8, Table 2, and contrasted with a comparative control shampoo containing a borate crosslinked cationic guar of (Example 9) and a shampoo containing no cationic guar (Example 10)<br>
SHAMPOO PREPARATION<br>
[0041]   The conditioning shampoo formulations in Table 2 were prepared by combining 77 parts by weight (pbw) of the surfactant premix composition shown<br>
in Table 3 with 19 pbw deionized water, and 0 3 pbw of the polymer of the invention using a Caframo overhead mechanical stirrer with a dispersion blade, stirnng at 600 rpm, and allowing the composition to mix for 45 minutes at ambient temperature At this time, 3 pbw of a silicone emulsion (Dow Corning 1784) was added to the formulation, and mixing was continued for an additional 15 minutes  The shampoo compositions were maintained at ambient temperature overnight, and the viscosity of each shampoo was measured using a Brookfield LVT viscometer with a small sample adapter, spindle 31, at the specified rotation speed<br>
Shampoo Viscosity Measurements<br>
[0042] Comparison of the shampoo viscosity for Example 8, which contains the glyoxal crosslinked cationic guar of the invention, with comparative Example 10, which contains no polymer, demonstrates the viscosifying performance of the<br>
*<br>
products of the invention  The viscosity of the shampoo in Examples 8 is similar to the viscosity of the shampoo containing borate crosslinked cationic guar in Example 9<br>
[0043] Cationic polysacchandes and other polymers have been used widely in personal care, household care, industrial, and institutional products to perform a function in the final product, ranging from the use of the polymer as gellants, binders, thickeners, stabilizers, emulsifiers, spreading and deposition aids and earners for enhancing the rheoiogy, efficacy, deposition, aesthetic and delivery of chemically and physiologically active ingredients in personal care, household care, institutional and industnal compositions   Depending on the application, the substrate to which the product is applied can be skin, hair, or textile substrates<br>
[0044] Cationic polysacchandes are used in hair care products to provide conditioning to the hair  In skin care products, these same polymers can provide conditioning effects to the skin  When incorporated into detergent and fabric softening formulations, these same polymers can provide conditioning, softening, anti-abrasion and antistatic characteristics to fabrics<br>
[0045] Wet and dry combability measurements are typical test methods used to measure conditioning performance in shampoo and conditioner applications The combing performance of each shampoo formulation was measured within 24 hours of shampoo preparation, on two medium brown virgin European hair tresses (National Hair Importers, New Jersey) that had been previously treated with a solution of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), rinsed, and dned overnight at 23°C and 50% relative humidity<br>
Combing Performance Measurements<br>
[0046] Combing performance was measured by applying the shampoo formulation to a tress wet with water, at a ratio of 0 5pbw shampoo/1 pbw hair tress  The tress was kneaded for 60 seconds, then rinsed with 40°C water for 30 seconds  This process was repeated, then the tress was nnsed with deionized water and excess water squeezed from the tress  The tress was placed on the double comb apparatus and wet combing force measured 8 fames on an Instron 5542 at a cross head speed of 12 5cm/min using the double comb method, with Ace hard rubber fine pocket combs, at 23°C and 50% relative humidity  Hair tresses were then allowed to dry overnight at 23°C and 50% relative humidity, and the dry comb performance was measured using the same double comb method  The normalized comb energies in Table 2 represent the total comb energy/weight of tress<br>
[0047] The conditioning performance of the products of the invention is demonstrated by the significantly reduced wet and dry combing energy results for Example 8 compared to the higher combing energies for the no polymer control shampoo in Example 10  The combing energies for Examples 8 compare well with the comb energy for the shampoo containing borate crosshnked cationic guar in Example 9<br>

EXAMPLES 11 and COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 12 Demonstration of use in Skin Care Application, Bodywash<br>
[0048] Trie thickening performance of the products of the invention in a<br>
bodywash formulation are demonstrated in Table 4  Bodywash formulations<br>
were prepared by addition of 0 3 pbw of the polymers of the invention in<br>
Example 7 to 76 pbw of the bodywash premix formulation in Table 5, and water<br>
(added to bnng the volume to 100)   Mixing was performed using an overhead<br>
mechanical stirrer with a dispersion blade, for 1 hr The pH of the bodywash was<br>
56<br>
<br>
[0049] The bodywash example 11 contains the polymer of the invention of Example 7 Addition of the polymer of the invention to the bodywash formulation leads to increased viscosity of the bodywash relative to the comparative control bodywash, containing no cationic guar, in Example 12<br>

 [0050] In addition to the use of non-borate metal salts as crosslinking agents for polygatactomannan polymers and their derivatives, other agents which form a water-swellable or water-dispersible complex with the polygalactomannan polymers, can also act to improve the water-dispersibihty of the polygalactomannan  These agents include oligomers or polymers containing phosphate, sulfate, sulfonate, carboxylate, or carbonate groups, including sodium hexametaphosphate polystyrene sulfonate, and proteins such as casein or whey which can form a water-dispersible complex with catiomc polygalactomannan polymers  These agents also include anionic, catiomc, and amphoteric surface-active agents such as ammonium lauryl sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate, cetyltnmethylammonium chloride or bromide, and cocamidopropyl betaine<br>
[0051] In addition, other crosslinkers, such as chloroformate, siloxane based crosslinking reagents, such as tnethoxysilane, glyoxal and other dialdehyde matenals can be used to crosslink the polygalactomannan, rendenng it water-dispersible<br>
[0052] The water-dispersible crosshnked products described above can then be used in applications such as personal care or household care products, where<br>
they can be dispersed and dissolved in aqueous phases by appropriate adjustment of the solution pH or by addition of salts<br>
