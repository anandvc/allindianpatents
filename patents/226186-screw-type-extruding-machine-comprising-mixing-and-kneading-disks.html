				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a screw-type extruding machine according to the<br>
preamble of claim 1.<br>
Screw-type extruding machines of the generic type which comprise mixing and<br>
kneading disks of the generic type have been known to a wide extent, for<br>
example from EP 0 875 356 B1 (corresponding to US 6 048 088), EP 0 160 124<br>
(corresponding to US 4 824 256) and EP 1 121 238 Bl (corresponding to US<br>
09/806 605). In these known screw-type extruding machines, several mixing<br>
and kneading disks are successively disposed on a screw shaft, combining to<br>
constitute a kneading block. These kneading blocks are designed such that the<br>
angle of crest misalignment made by neighboring kneading disks is integrally<br>
contained in 360°. The first and last mixing and kneading disk of a kneading<br>
block frequently are congruent. Kneading blocks with five successive mixing and<br>
kneading disks and two-flight design may for example comprise successive<br>
mixing and kneading disks of an angle of crest misalignment of 45°.<br>
US Patent 5,728,337 discloses nine kneading disks of two-flight design which are<br>
successively disposed on a screw shaft. Adjacent kneading disks have an angle<br>
of crest misalignment of 22.5°. Since the kneading disks are of two-flight design<br>
and the angle of crest misalignment is 22.5°, the first and the ninth kneading<br><br>
disks are superimposed, that is the two kneading disks are congruent.<br>
Furthermore, an integral multiple of the angle of crest misalingment is equal to<br>
360° (16 x 22.5° = 360°).<br>
With the positions of engagement of the mixing and kneading disks of a pair of<br>
mixing and kneading disks varying upon rotation of the screw shaft and thus of<br>
the mixing and kneading disks, varying turning moments will result during a<br>
motion of rotation and act on the respective screw shaft. In the above, known<br>
design and arrangement of mixing and kneading disks, torque momenta - short,<br>
strong turning moment increases - result, which are still increased by the fact<br>
that congruent positions of the mixing and kneading disks occur simultaneously<br>
for several times in the described symmetric kneading blocks. As a result,<br>
considerable vibratory stresses can occur in the entire drive train in the case of<br>
resonance. The drive train comprises all rotary parts of the driving motor,<br>
coupling and transmission, and the screw shafts with mixing and kneading disks<br>
and, possibly, screws.<br><br>
It is an object of the invention to improve the screw-type extruding machine in<br>
such a way that vibratory problems are at least reduced.<br>
According to the invention, this object is attained by the directly successive<br>
mixing and kneading disks making an angle of crest misalignment, wherein an<br>
integral multiple of the respective angle of crest misalignment is not equal to<br>
360°; and wherein none of the successive mixing and kneading disks are<br>
congruent.<br>
As a result of the design according to the invention, not even a great number of<br>
mixing and kneading disks in successive arrangement will be able to occasion<br>
simultaneous torque momenta that might lead to inadmissibly high amplitudes in<br>
the vicinity of resonance spots of the drive train.<br>
Further features, details and advantages of the invention will become apparent<br>
from the ensuing description of an exemplary embodiment, taken in conjunction<br>
with the accompanying drawings, in which<br>
Figure 1 is a diagrammatic plan view of a screw-type extruding machine in<br>
an illustration sectionally broken away;<br>
Figure 2 is a lateral view of a kneading block comprising five mixing<br>
and kneading disks;<br><br>
Fig. 3 is an elevation of the kneading block in accordance with the arrow<br>
III of Fig. 2;<br>
Fig. 4 is another elevation of the kneading block in accordance with the<br>
arrow IV of Fig. 2; and<br>
Fig. 5 is a cross-sectional view of the screw-type extruding machine on<br>
the line V-V of Fig. 1.<br>
The twin-screw extruder 1 seen in the drawing is driven by a motor 2 via a<br>
coupling 3 and a subsequent transmission 4. The casing 5 of the screw-type<br>
extruding machine 1 includes two casing bores 6, 6' which intersect in the<br>
form of a horizontal figure eight, having parallel axes 7, 7'. Screw shafts 8,<br>
8' are disposed in the bores 6, 6', the axes of which coincide with the axes<br>
7, 7'. The screw shafts 8, 8' are driven by way of the transmission 4 in the<br>
same direction of rotation 9, 9'.<br>
At its end in vicinity to the transmission 4, the casing 5 comprises a feed<br>
hopper 10, through which to supply material that is to be treated. Subse-<br>
quently, screws 11, 11' are mounted on the screw shafts 8, 8', constituting a<br>
feed zone 12.<br>
Subsequently, mixing and kneading disks 13, 13', 14, 14', 15, 15', 16, 16'<br>
and 17, 17' are non-rotatably mounted on the screw shafts 8, 8'; they are<br>
integrally embodied as kneading blocks 18, 18' in the exemplary embodi-<br>
ment shown. A mixing and kneading zone 19 is formed in the vicinity of<br>
these kneading blocks 18, 18', which is followed by a conveying and pres-<br>
sure build-up zone 20 again including screws 21, 21' that are non-rotatably<br>
mounted on the screw shafts 8, 8'. After these screws 21, 21', screw tips 22,<br><br>
22' are formed on the screw shafts 8, 8', which, in the conveying direction<br>
23 i.e., at the end opposite the feed hopper 10, are followed by a die 24 that<br>
finishes the casing 5. The screws 11, 11' which are arranged in pairs as well<br>
as the mixing and kneading disks 13, 13' to 17, 17' and the screws 21,21'<br>
are embodied for interengagement i.e., they mesh closely. The rotary parts<br>
of the motor 2, coupling 3 and transmission 4 and the screw shafts 8, 8',<br>
along with the screws 11, 11' as well as the mixing and kneading disks 13,<br>
13' to 17, 17', constitute a drive train.<br>
As seen in the drawing, the screws 11, 11' and 21, 21' as well as the mixing<br>
and kneading disks 13, 13' to 17, 17' are two-flight. The disks 13, 13' to 17,<br>
17' consequently have crests 25, 25' and 26, 26' and flanks 27, 27' and 28,<br>
28' which, upon rotation in the direction of rotation 9, 9', move past each<br>
other in a manner known per se. The crests 25, 25' and 26, 26' rotate by<br>
some play i.e., leaving a minor gap 29, 29', towards the wall 30, 30' of the<br>
casing bore 6, 6'. A crest 25, 26 of a mixing and kneading disk 13 to 17<br>
runs by some minor clearance past a flank 27', 28' of another mixing and<br>
kneading disk 13' to 17' allocated to the pair, and vice versa. This is general<br>
practice taught for two-flight mixing and kneading disks by EP 0 875 356<br>
B1 (corresponding to US 6 048 088), or for one-flight mixing and kneading<br>
disks by EP 1 121 238 B1 (corresponding to U.S. serial number<br>
09/806 605), or for three- or four-flight mixing and kneading disks by EP<br>
0 160 124 A2 (corresponding to US 4 824 256).<br>
The successive disks 13, 13' to 17, 17' are cross-sectionally identical<br>
crosswise of the axis 7 and 7'. Each individual disk, when of two-flight de-<br>
sign, is doubly mirror symmetric. The disks have a crest angle a or a' and a<br>
flank angle b or b', with a + b = a' + b'=l 80° and a = a' and b = b' applying<br>
in the case of two-flight design.<br><br>
Center planes 31, 31', 32, 32', 33, 33', 34, 34' and 35, 35' centrally intersect<br>
the crests 25, 26 and 25', 26' and the respective axis 7, 7', with the two cen-<br>
ter planes of mixing and kneading disks that are directly successive in the<br>
conveying direction 23 making an angle of crest misalignment. Conse-<br>
quently, the center planes 31, 32 of the disks 13, 14 make an angle c,<br>
whereas the center planes 31', 32' of the disks 13', 14' make an angle c'. The<br>
center planes 32, 33 of the disks 14, 15 make an angle d, whereas the cen-<br>
ter planes 32', 33' of the disks 14', 15' make and angle d'. The center planes<br>
33, 34 of the disks 15, 16 make an angle e, whereas the center planes 33',<br>
34' of the disks 15', 16' make an angle e'. Finally, the center planes 34, 35<br>
of the disks 16, 17 make an angle f, whereas the center planes 34', 35' of<br>
the disks 16', 17' make an angle f. The angles of crest misalignment of<br>
each pair of mixing and kneading disks 13 and 13' or 14 and 14', and so<br>
forth, are identical, with c = c', d = d1, e = e' and f = f applying. On the<br>
other hand, c, d, e, f and c', d', e', f need not be respectively identical.<br>
Rather, an integral multiple of the respective angles of crest misalignment<br>
c, c', d, d', e, e', f, f must be unequal to 360°. In other words, the angle of<br>
crest misalignment between two mixing and kneading disks that adjoin in<br>
the conveying direction 23 is not contained integrally in 360°. As a result,<br>
even with several successive pairs of mixing and kneading disk 13, 13' to<br>
17, 17', there will be no identical position of engagement of two pairs of<br>
mixing and kneading disks.<br>
By way of explanation it is added that the turning moments exercised by a<br>
respective pair of mixing and kneading disks 13, 13' to 17, 17' on the screw<br>
shaft 8, 8' are not constant during an entire rotation. As a result, in particu-<br>
lar when several pairs of mixing and kneading disks are arranged succes-<br>
sively, any material to be treated, namely melt, powder etc., can only es-<br><br>
cape in the conveying direction 23. With the free cross sections varying<br>
during complete rotation of the disks of a pair of disks, varying turning<br>
moments occur during a rotation of each screw shaft 8 and 8'. The highest<br>
turning moments occur when two crests 25, 25' and 26, 26' are in the vicin-<br>
ity of a respective approximate triangle 36 and 36'. These approximate tri-<br>
angles 36, 36' are the acute areas that form in the casing 5 where the casing<br>
bores 6, 6' pass into each other. In this position, the free cross section of the<br>
casing bores 6, 6' is especially small. With the angles of crest misalignment<br>
between the mixing and kneading disks, according to general practice, in-<br>
tegrally going into 360° and, in the case of two-flight mixing and kneading<br>
disks, integrally going into 180°, in particular when amounting to 45° for<br>
two-flight disks, then, during a rotation of the screw shafts 8, 8', these fluc-<br>
tuations of torque, during a respective rotation of the screw shafts 8, 8', oc-<br>
cur at a frequency that depends on the speed of the screw shafts 8, 8'. With<br>
a resonant frequency of the drive train corresponding to the mentioned fre-<br>
quency of the turning-moment fluctuations, these turning-moment ampli-<br>
tudes would be inadmissibly increased at the spots of resonance, given a<br>
conventional arrangement of the mixing and kneading disks with angles of<br>
crest misalignment contained integrally in 360°. The specified measures<br>
largely preclude this problem.<br>
As seen in Fig. 5, the screw shafts 8, 8' have an external serration which<br>
engages with an internal serration 37 of the mixing and kneading disks 13,<br>
13' to 17, 17', this producing a non-rotary connection between the disks and<br>
the screw shafts 8, 8'. The same applies to the screws 11, 11' and 21, 21'.<br>
The serration 37 has a pitch angle g which goes integrally into 360°.<br>
g = 15° applies when twenty-four teeth 38 are disposed along the periph-<br>
ery; g = 10° applies in the case of thirty-six teeth 38; g = 30° applies when<br>
twelve teeth 38 are disposed along the periphery; and so forth. With several<br><br>
disks 13, 13' to 17, 17' disposed successively, the sum of the angles of crest<br>
misalignment c + d + e + f is advantageously equal to an integral multiple<br>
of g. In this case, further similar kneading blocks or screws can be joined<br>
without any misalignment or additional special transition elements.<br><br>
