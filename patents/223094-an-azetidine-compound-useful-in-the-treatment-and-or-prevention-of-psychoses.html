The compounds of formula (I) for which R represents a radical CRiR2 in which RI represents a radical -alk-NRisRig, RIS represents an alkyl radical and<br>
Rig represents an alkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, cycloalkylcarbonyl, -S02alk, -CO-NHalk or -COOalk radical may be prepared by the action of an alkyl halide on a compound of formula (I) for which R represents a radical CRiR2 in which RI represents a radical -alk-NRigRig, RIB represents a hydrogen atom and Rig represents an alkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, cycloalkylcarbonyl, -S02alk, -CO-NHalk or -COOalk radical.<br>
This reaction is carried out in an inert polar solvent such as acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran or dimethylformamide, in the presence of an organic or inorganic base' (alkali metal (for example sodium or potassium) carbonate, trialkylamine (for example triethylamine or dimethylaminopyridine)), at a temperature of between 0°C and the boiling point of the solvent, optionally in the presence of palladium or one of its salts or complexes.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) for which R<br>
represents a radical CRiR2 in which either RI represents a hydrogen atom and R2 represents a radical -C(R8) (R9) (Rio) or -C(R8) (Rn) (Ri2), or RI represents an alkyl, NH-Ris, cyano, -S-alk-NR16Ri7, -alk-NR18Ri9 or -NR20R2i radical and R2 represents a radical -C(Rs) (Rii) (Ri2) and RS represents an alkyl radical may be prepared by alkylation of a corresponding compound of formula (I) for which R8 is a hydrogen atom.<br>
This reaction is preferably carried out by means of a base such as an alkali metal hydride (for<br>
example sodium hydride), an alkali metal amide (for example sodium amide) or an organometallic derivative, in an inert solvent such as an aliphatic ether (ethyl ether) or tetrahydrofuran, at a temperature of between -78°C and 30°C, by means of an alkylating agent such as an alkyl halide or an alkyl sulfonate.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) for which R represents a radical C=C (R-i) SC^alk may also be prepared according to the following reaction scheme:<br>
(Figure Remove) <br><br><br>
In these formulae, R3, R4 and R7 have the same meanings as in formula (I), alk represents an alkyl radical and Hal represents a halogen atom.<br>
Reaction A is generally carried out in an inert solvent such as an ether (for example ethyl ether), in the presence' of a strong base such as tert-butyllithium<br><br>
or n-butyllithium, at a temperature of between -70°C and -50°C, followed by the addition of sulfur and then an alkyl halide (for example iodide or bromide).<br>
Reaction B is generally carried out in an inert solvent such as an ether (for example tetrahydrofuran), in the presence of a strong base such as tert-butyllithium or n-butyllithium, at a temperature of between -70°C and -50°C, followed by the addition of azeditin-3-one, a return to room temperature and hydrolysis.<br>
Reaction C is carried out by any known method which makes it possible to oxidize a sulfur-containing derivative without affecting the rest of the molecule, such as those previously described.<br>
It is understood for persons skilled in the art that, to carry out the processes according to the invention which are described above, it may be necessary to introduce groups protecting amino, hydroxyl and carboxyl functions in order to avoid side reactions. These groups are those which allow removal without affecting the rest of the molecule. As examples of groups protecting the amino function, there may be mentioned tert-butyl or methyl carbamates which may be regenerated using iodotrimethylsilane or allyl using palladium catalysts. As examples of groups protecting the hydroxyl function, there may be mentioned triethylsilyl and tert-butyldimethylsilyl which may be regenerated using tetrabutylammonium fluoride or alternatively asymmetric acetals (methoxymethyl or<br><br>
tetrahydropyranyl for example) with regeneration using hydrochloric- acid. As groups protecting carboxyl functions, there may be mentioned esters (allyl or benzyl for example), oxazoles and 2-alkyl-l,3-oxazolines. Other protecting groups which can be used are described by GREENE T.W. et al., Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, second edition, 1991, John Wiley &amp; Sons.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may be purified by the customary known methods, for example by crystallization, chromatography or extraction.<br>
The enantiomers of the compounds of formula (I) may be obtained by resolution of the racemates for example by chromatography on a chiral column according to PIRCKLE W.H. et al., Asymmetric synthesis, Vol. 1, Academic Press (1983) or by formation of salts or by synthesis from chiral precursors. The diastereoisomers may be prepared according to known conventional methods (crystallization, chromatography or from chiral precursors).<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may be optionally converted to addition salts with an inorganic or organic acid by the action of such an acid in an organic solvent such as an alcohol, a ketone, an ether or a chlorinated solvent. These salts also form part of the invention.<br>
As examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts, the following salts may be mentioned: benzenesulfonate, hydrobromide, hydrochloride, citrate,<br><br>
ethanesulfonate, fumarate, gluconate, iodate, isethionate, maleate, methane sulfonate, methylene-bis-p-oxynaphthoate, nitrate, oxalate, pamoate, phosphate, salicylate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, theophyllineacetate and p-toluenesulfonate.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) exhibit advantageous pharmacological properties. These compounds possess a high affinity for the cannabinoid receptors and particularly those of the CB1 type. They are CB1 receptor antagonists and are therefore useful in the treatment and prevention of disorders affecting the central nervous system, the immune system, the cardiovascular or endocrine system, the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal apparatus and reproductive disorders (Hollister, Pharm. Rev.; 38, 1986, 1-20, Reny and Sinha, Prog. Drug Res., 36, 71-114 (1991), Consroe and Sandyk, in Marijuana/Cannabinoids, Neurobiology and Neurophysiology, 459, Murphy L. and Barthe A. Eds, CRC Press, 1992) .<br>

They may also be'used for the treatment or prevention of intestinal transit.<br>

tetrahydropyranyl for example) with regeneration using hydrochloric- acid. As groups protecting carboxyl functions, there may be mentioned esters (allyl or benzyl for example), oxazoles and 2-alkyl-l,3-oxazolines.
