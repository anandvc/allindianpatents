				<td>FILED OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a system and method for adjusting garment pattern measurements. More specifically, the present invention relates to a system and method for adjusting garment pattern measurements providing an adjusted garment measurement to compensate for bulk wash shrinkage after the garments are fabricated.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the textile industry one of the main obstacles to properly cutting patterns into fabric is related to the shrinkage that occurs during the initial washing.  Generally, based on type of fabric, thickness, type of cut and other factors, different materials cut patterns shrink differendy as a result of varying shrinkage resistances.  When designing a textile garment pattern one method of manufacture calls for the clothing designer to supply the manufacturer the final garment measurements assuming that shrinkage has already occurred.  This requires the end manufacturer of the desired garment to wash and dry the fabric on the roll so that the shrinkage occurs before the pattern is cut.  This allows the pre-shrunk fabric to be assembled according to final garment measurements without any post-assembly aberrations.<br>
Another possible method for manufacturing garments is for the designer to supply the manufacturer the dimensions of garment with additional material calculated in such that the manufacturer can cut the fabric pattern, stitch the garment and wash and shrink it to size.  In this case the designer will give specifications for a garment design that are larger than wanted so that the manufacturer can assemble the shirt with fabric cut from an unwashed roll. When the garment is cut, stitched and washed the garment then shrinks down to the desired size for the final garment specification.<br>
This stitching of garment fabric together before the initial shrink washing gives an added texture to the garment in fhe form of a wrinkling effect around the seam areas of the garment, caused by the shrinking material pulling against the seam stitching. This effect is considered desirable to some fashion designers who include this wrinkled style of garments in their garment lines.<br>
However, there are sometimes variations in the washing and shrinking process between different manufactures, caused by different washing procedures, different fabric origins and other factors. Because of these differences it is hard for a clothing designer to fabricate a single garment design in the above mentioned second method, that is to be cut and stitched before any shrinkage, that will work consistendy for all of its manufacturers. Because of this, manufacturers generally get the final garment measurements with instructions to cut and stitch me fabric before shrinkage but without the benefit of knowing how much additional fabric if necessary. This creates a problem for the manufacturer because there is currently no way to expand the fabric measurements from the final garment measurements to the pre-shrinkage cut and stitch dimensions other than by trial and error.<br>
This trial and error method is costly and time consuming, and also has inherent problems with consistency. A manufacturer will receive a fabric pattern for a garment that gives the desired sale measurements. Then it is up to die manufacturer to expand those measurements out so that when the garment is stitched together and washed it will hopefully shrink to the designers final garment measurements.  If it does not then modifications need to be made and the process is repeated.<br>
This current system gives rise to a need for a method which can, with considerable accuracy estimate the expansion parameters to convert a designer's final garment measurements into to a pre-shrinkage cut and assemble measurement, such that when the manufacture is asked to cut and assemble the<br>
garment before shrinking the fabric, most if not all of the trial and error process of measurement conversion can be eliminated. This invention overcomes the shortcomings o the currently used systems and provides a method for calculating the measurement increases necessary to convert final garment measurements to pre-shrinkage cut and stitch measurements.<br>
OBTECT AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus, it is the object of the present invention to overcome the drawbacks associated with the prior art so as to avoid trail and error process in generating textile patterns that account for extra material necessary for shrinkage.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a method for preparing garments said method comprising the steps of measuring raw shrinkage values for said garment in a manner such as hereinbefore described; calculating an enlarged garment specification, being larger than a desired garment specification, based on said raw shrinkage values in a manner such as hereinbefore described; cutting fabrics based on said engaged garment specification, stitching said fabrics into a garment which meets said enlarged garment specifications; and bulk washing said garment, such that after said bulk wash, said garment will meet said desired garment specification.<br><br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, a system and method for modifying garment specifications, comprises steps, allowing a user to begin with a first garment specification and to modify it into an enlarged garment specification such that when a garment is prepared with enlarged garment specification and subsequently assembled and bulk washed, it will be in accordance with or be within acceptable tolerance of the original first garment specifications.<br>
The present invention relates to a method 10 for garment manufacturers to fabricate a garment that is oversized, such that when it is shrunk during the bulk wash process it will conform to a garment specification 12. To this end, as illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, the garment manufacturer will uses fabric cut from fabric roll 11 and bulk washing device 13.<br>
During the garment fabrication process, a first test fabric 20a and a second test fabric 20b are cut from the same fabric roll 11 to be used during the creation of garment 18.  As illustrated in Fig. 3 test fabrics 20a and 20b are cut in equal sizes.  Preferably, 24 inch squares are traced onto test fabrics 20 such that they generally reflect the average size fabric cut to be used in the garment 18. A more detailed description of test fabrics 20 and their use is described below.<br>
In addition to test fabrics 20, the garment manufacturer must create garment 18. To this end, the manufacture begins with garment specification 12 given to him by the designer. However, in order to proceed with garments 18<br>
that are designed to be assembled before the bulk washing process, garment specifications 12 need to be modified into enlarged garment specifications 14 via pre wash modification system 24.<br>
To illustrate this Figs. 4a and 4b display how garment 18 will appear differently tliroughout the fabrication process.  Fig. 4a illustrates garment 18 before bulk washing, created using enlarged garment specification 14.  The material used will be oversized for the stitching lengths causing a ruffling at the seems.  Fig. 4b illustrates garment 18 after the bulk wash, conforming to garment specification 12.  After bulk washing garment 18, the fabric has shrunk to match the stitching and meets the requirements of garment specification 12.  Because garment 18 was assembled before it was shrunk, the seams will display a particular texture that can not be achieved by assembling garment 18 after bulk washing die fabric.<br>
To achieve these results, system 24 allows the manufacturer to<br>
increase the garment specification 12 into enlarged garment specification 14 such<br>
that when a garment 18 is fabricated according to enlarged garment specification<br>
14, and then bulk washed under specified conditions, the resulting after-wash<br>
garment will comply with the original garment specification 12 provided by the<br>
designer.<br>
)	As illustrated in Fig. 5, system 24 is comprised of a pre-wash<br>
processor 25, a garment specification table 32 populated by original garment specifications 12, a formula table 15 populated by data relating to die selected formula 34, die corresponding modification percentages 36 with combination<br>
fractions 48 (if necessary), shrinkage percentage orientation table 39, a raw shrinkage data table 17 populated by raw shrinkage? results 22, working shrinkage result calculator 19 for producing working shrinkage results 30 from raw shrinkage results 22, a shrinkage amount table 42 populated by the shrinkage amounts 40, and an enlarged garment specification table 44 populated by the calculated enlarged garment specification 14.  The complete operation of system 24 is described in more detail below.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention a garment manufacturer receives garment specification 12 corresponding to an after-bulkwash specification where the pattern is to be cut and assembled into garment 18 and then bulk-washed and shrunk to meet the requirements of garment specification 12. This technique is used to produce desired effects not attainable by bulk washing garment pieces before assembly.<br>
As depicted in a flow chart 90, as seen in Fig. 6, at a first step 100 the manufacturer begins by procuring test fabric 20 made of the same material to be used by garment 18. Test fabric 20 should be relaxed or removed from the roll so it will be treated similarly to the actual treatment of garments 18 that will be produced from the same or similar rolls.  Additionally, to prevent test fabric 20 from presenting aberrant shrinkage behavior, test fabric 20 should be taken from a )      piece of fabric roll 11 that is at least three yards from the end cut. This will<br>
assure that test fabric 20 will be composed of fabric that was produced and treated under similar stresses and tensions as the fabric that will ultimately be used in producing garments 18.<br>
Next, at step 102, two squares of acceptable size, for example 24 inches, are traced onto test fabric 20 and separated into test fabric 20a and test fabric 20b. Several copies of test fabric 20b can be produced from test fabric 20 in case of any problems with the bulk wash seuings of before-wash test garment 28 in steps 114-116 as will be discussed later.  At step 104, test fabric 20a is washed under the specified bulk wash conditions while test fabric 20b is stored for use later in the process.  Next, at step 106, test fabric 20a is measured producing raw shrinkage results 22 for test fabric 20a.<br>
Shrinkage results 22 consist of two components a length shrinkage<br>
       measurement 221 and a width shrinkage measurement 22w. It is important to note that the orientation of the test fabric with relation to the fabric roll determines which measurement is which. Length shrinkage measurement 221 is based on the shrinkage perpendicular to the spindle axis of fabric roll 11.  Width shrinkage measurement 22w is based on the shrinkage parallel the spindle axis of fabric roll<br>
        11.  Even if test fabric 20a is of a square shape the shrinkages under bulk wash conditions will be different. A greater shrinkage is expected in length shrinkage measurement 221 based on various factors mat affect fabric tension as it is placed on fabric roll 11 including but not limited to the tension at which it is was placed on the roll and the stitching pattern.<br>
 	At step 108, raw shrinkage results 22 are entered in to system 24 which<br>
alters the original garment specifications 12 into enlarged garment specification 14 such mat when garment 18 is assembled and shrunk it will be in accordance with original garment specification 12. A more detailed description of system 24 is<br>
described in the next portion of the specification and will more fully describe the process of converting garment specification 12 into enlarged garment specification 14.<br>
After system 24 enlarges the input garment specification 12 into an output enlarged garment specification 14 the user proceeds to step 110 where system 24 then displays enlarged garment specification table 44 populated by die calculated enlarged garment specifications 14. Enlarged garment specifications 14 are then entered by the user into the device that will be cutting the fabric from fabric roll 11. Both steps 108 and 110 are more fully described below in the section discussing the operation of garment specification modification program 24.<br>
Next, at step 112 one sample before-wash test garment 28 is cut from fabric roll 11 and assembled in accordance with enlarged garment specification 14.  The fabric used to create garment 18 and before wash test garment 28 is cut from fabric roll 11 using a digital CAD/CAM device in accordance with the output of system 24.  However, the CAD/CAM (Computer Aided Drafting/CAM) device is not necessary, any means of cutting the fabric from fabric roll 11 in accordance with enlarged garment specification 14 is widnn the contemplation of me present invention.<br>
At step 114, die assembled before-wash test garment 28 is then washed under the same conditions as the bulk washing that all of the garments from fabric roll 11 will be washed. At step 116, test fabric 20b, used as a control, is washed along with before-wash test garment 28. Before-wash test garment 28 is checked to see if it is within acceptable tolerance of die requirements of garment<br>
specification 12.  If before-wash test garment 28 is within an acceptable tolerance, then the initial settings used in system 24 were correct and the process for cutting of fabric in accordance with enlarged garment specification 14 can commence for the desired number of garments 18.<br>
However, if before wash test garment 28 has shrunk too much or shrunk too little, or some combmation of the two along different axes, then die user must proceed to an adjustment mode.  A this point, step 118, test fabric 20b is checked against test fabric 20a. If test fabrics 20a and 20b are different, then it is possible that modification to the washing process or bulk washing device 13 are at fault for tire aberrations in the outcome of before-wash test garment 28.  Some conditions that could cause aberrations in the bulk wash process include but are not limited to humidity factors, heat variations in drying and water/detergent quality. If this is die case, the process should be repeated from step 112 paying careful attention to maintain consistent bulk wash conditions during the repeating of step 114.<br>
However, assuming the shrinkage of the two test fabrics 20a and 20b are the same, dien it can be assumed Uiat the bulk wash conditions remained die same between the first washing of test fabric 20a, and the second washing for before-wash test garment 28 and test fabric 20b. If this is the case, the user returns to steps 108-110 and to system 24 for adjustments uiat will be discussed in more detail below.  This process is repeated until before wash test garment 28 comes widtin a acceptable tolerance of garment specification 12 at step 116.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, pre-wash modification system 24 is employed to convert garment specification 12 into<br>
enlarged garment specification 14. System 24 relates specifically to the process discussed above in steps 108 and 110 of the overall method 10.  System 24 utilizes raw shrinkage results 22, listed in raw shrinkage data table 17, from test fabric 20a to modify garment specification 12, resulting in enlarged garment specification 14 such that the trial and error process currently employed can be mostly avoided.  By using shrinkage results 22 and modifying them based on direction the garment pieces are cut and the type of fabric and type of patterns employed (shirt, pants, yoke area, ect.), system 24 estimates the exact enlarged garment specification 14, significantly reducing the lengthy trial and error process.<br>
A more detailed description of the operation of the system is illustrated in Fig 7. Fig. 7 illustrates a flow chart 290 of the operation of the system 24.  Figure 8 illustrates a print-out 25 from system 24 of enlarged garment specification 14 corresponding to formula 34a.  Print-out 25 illustrates the data contained in raw shrinkage data table 17, working shrinkage results 30, garment specification table 32, shrinkage amount table 42, enlarged garment specification table 43, and shrinkage percentage orientation table 39.<br>
At a first step 300 in the operation of system 24, the user must enter both length shrinkage results 221 and width shrinkage results 22w into raw shrinkage data table 17. These shrinkage results 22 that are entered into system 24 represent die raw shrinkage percentages of test fabric 20a. The size of test fabric 20a can be of any size that would accurately display the shrinkage behavior of the rest of the fabric on fabric roll 11. If test fabric 20a is too small it may by<br>
difficult to measure the shrinkage percentage accurately and the piece may also present some aberrant shrinkage results.<br>
Next, at step 302, the shrinkage results 22 (221 and 22w) are modified into working shrinkage results 30 by working shrinkage results calculator before the process continues.  Working shrinkage results 30 are used to account for the additional material shrinkage when additional material is added to garment specification 12.  For example, when test fabric 20a is shrunk in bulk wash conditions a shrinkage result 22 is obtained.  However, when the actual fabric is enlarged to account for the fabric shrinkage, a small amount additional fabric, or the shrinkage fabric 40, is added in excess of garment specification 12. Just as the amount of original fabric shrinks, the additional fabric added to the garment also shrinks.  To compensate for the shrinkage of shrinkage amount 40, raw shrinkage results 22 are modified by working shrinkage result calculator 19 into working shrinkage results 30 using the equation: 100((1 + x) + (x + x/100))-100/100<br>
where x = either length or width shrinkage results 221 or 22w This produces working shrinkage results 30 by adding an additional percentage equal to die original shrinkage results 22.<br>
For example as illustrated in Fig. 8, length shrinkage result 221 was i      measured at 8.33%, entered at step 300. This number was modified into<br>
9 02389% or working shrinkage result 301, by using die above equation at step 302. Here 8.33% of 8.33% is 0.693889%, which when added to 8.33% yields 9.02389%. This enlarged working shrinkage result 30 will account for the<br><br>
shrinkage not only of the garment specification 12 but also of the additional several inches fabric needed to create the pattern for enlarged garment specification 14. This assumes that the shrinkage of the extra material will occur at roughly the same percentage as the shrinkage of the majority of the garment piece.<br>
At step 304, the user enters garment specification 12 into garment specification table 32 the contents of which are displayed on printout 27, as illustrated in Fig 8.  The sample garment used in Fig. 8 is a shirt made of a woven material.  These numbers represent the final measurements that garment 18 must conform to widiin acceptable tolerance. The numbers listed on garment specification table 32 in Fig. 8 are in inches.<br>
Next, at step 306, the user picks a formula 34 from system 24, as stored in formula table 15 based on several factors that can effect the shrinkage of garment 18. Examples of these factors include but are not limited to knit fabrics versus woven fabrics, pattern cut direction with respect to the fabric roll direction, stretch properties of the style of garment, bulk washing formulas, and other features of the garment such as pockets which affect shrinkage during bulk washing.  A more detailed description of some of the possible formulas 34 for system 24, detailing their particular uses is discussed below.<br>
Regarding bulk wash conditions, Figures 20 and 21 illustrates a bulk wash formula tables 200 and 210. Table 200 is for bulk wash conditions for shirts arid table 210 is for bulk wash conditions for pants. Using tables 200 and 210 the user can determine based on the wash duration, wash temperature, fabric<br>
construction, fabric weight, fabric finish, and type of wash if any modifications to formula 34 are required. For example, longer or more intense washes tend to breakdown a fabrics ability to resist shrinkage, whereas lighter shoner washes will allow die fabric to retain its strength and its ability to resist shrinkage.<br>
Regarding pockets, Figure 22 illustrates a sample pocket chart 220 which shows the modification amounts to shrinkage calculations mat for pants based on the number of pockets. Additional stitching from the pockets adds resistance to shrinkage.  However, as the fabric is washed longer or under harsh conditions, this resistance is broken down.  As such, chart 220 illustrates mis, in<br>
       that  additional material is added to the waistband of die pants in larger amounts when mere are less pockets, because there is less resistance shrinkage. Similarly, more fabric needs to be added as the bulk wash cycle is lengthened, because die harsher washing conditions also break down the resistance to shrinkage. Chart 220 is correlated to shirt chart 200 and pants chart 210 in diat the numbers on die<br>
        left column, 2-5, 6-9, 10-13 and 14-17 are derived based on me bulk wash formula calculation found on the right column in charts 200 and 210.<br>
These criteria for assisting in selection of formula 34 are intended only as examples of possible calculations used to select formula 34 and are in no way intended to limit die scope of the present invention. Any such assessment of<br>
       a fabric shrinkage factor used to help select the correct formula 34 for use in system 24 is wimin me contemplation of me present invention.<br>
Formula 34 can be created in one of several ways. One example for me base formula used for formulas 34a-34e, as illustrated in Figs. 8-12, as<br>
stored in formula table are referred to as 15 "Master woven shirt formula #l-#5 w/body at X%-Y% breakdown of 100% shrinkage w/collar and band at Z%." Here X% represents the percent shrinkage in the armhole and Y% the remaining shrinkage percentage, which adds up to 100% shrinkage attributable to the remaining height of the back.<br>
The Z% shrinkage is the shrinkage percentage out of 100% that in the collar and band will experience. For example, if the overall shrinkage percentage is 10%,  then Z% represents the percentage of that 10% overall shrinkage that will be displayed by the collar and the band. This Z% is separate from the calculations associated with the X% and the Y%.<br>
These percentages relate to modifications to working shrinkage results 301 and 30w based on modifications to raw shrinkage results 22 from test fabric 20a.  The results obtained from test fabrics 20 do not necessary reflect the actual shrinkage that the various elements of garment 18 will experience during i      the bulk washing. Test fabric 20a is a flat unstitched piece of fabric, however the various pieces of garment 18 such as the collar, waist cuff, front and the back, include stitchings and stretching factors (from bulk wash process) that may reduce the shrinkage. Therefore, system 24 uses formulas 34 and tiieir associated modification percentages 36 stored in formula table 15 to create working )      shrinkage results 30.<br>
One example of formula 34a, illustrated in the chart in Fig. 8, is "Master woven shirt formula #1 w/body at 60%-40% Breakdown of 100% shrinkage w/collar and band at 60%." Formula 34a is used here as an example<br>
for illustrating the complete operation of system 24, however any one of a list of programs can be chosen at step 306 depending on the intended garment style, fabric to be used, and bulk wash specifications. The 60% +40% breakdown of 100% represent the principal modification percentages 36 for length (60%) and width (40%).  Also, the collar and band measurements are adjusted by 60% in formula 34a.   However, because some of the measurements used in garment specification 12 incorporate measurements along bom the length and width axes, the actual modification percentages 36 for the various pieces of garment 18 range from 50% to 100%.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 8, the various modification percentages 36 used for each garment piece is listed beside diat piece in modification percentage column 38 of print out 25, as populated by formula table 15 based on the formula 34 chosen. When selecting a formula 34 from formula table 15, the user bases the decision on their own knowledge and experience as well as some general guidelines discussed below.  If the wrong formula 34 is chosen then garment 18 will not meet the requirements of garment specification 12. This could be one of the factors, described above at steps 108 and 110, where the user may have to adjust system 24 to achieve acceptable results.<br>
At step 308, the user selects formula 34a from formula table 15 of )      system 24 which in turn instructs before-wash processor 25 of the appropriate modification percentage 36. These modification percentages also populates modification percentage column 38 in print out 25, as illustrated on Fig. 8. Next, at step 310, before-wash processor 25 of system 24 calculates enlarged garment<br>
specification 14 by using working shrinkage result 30, modifying it with the appropriate modification percentage 36 and applying it to garment specification 12 for each piece of garment 18 such as, the top collar, chest, and waist etc. This results in a shrinkage amount 40, which in turn populates shrinkage amount table 42.<br>
When calculating shrinkage amount 40, working shrinkage results 30 are multiplied by modification percentages 36.  However, there are two sets of working shrinkage results, 30w and 301.  A shrinkage results orientation table 39, populated with data retrieved from formula table 15, identifies which of the working shrinkage results 301 or 30w is necessary for each particular garment 18 piece.  Shrinkage results orientation table 39 lists either an L or a W or both next to each garment 18 piece. The contents of shrinkage results orientation table 39 are displayed on printout 27 next to each piece of garment 18.   Based on this information, system 24 will use the proper working shrinkage results 301 or 30w when multiplying by modification percentages 36.  As explained above the orientation of the fabric off of fabric roll 11, is the determining factor in which working shrinkage result 30 from test fabric 20a is for the length and which is for the width. When garment specification 12 is given to the manufacturer the pattern must be matched against the justified against fabric roll 11 orientation.<br>
After, shrinkage amount 40 is calculated by before-wash processor 25 of system 24, it is added to garment specification 12 resulting in enlarged garment specification 14, and stored as output in enlarged garment specification table 44. Print out 25 displays me results found in enlarged garment specification<br>
table 44 nest to each piece of garment 18, as illustrated in Fig. 8.  These calculations are performed in accordance with the following equation;<br>
((X% x Y%)xSg) + Sg = ESg<br>
where X = working shrinkage results, Y= modification percentage<br>
36, Sg = garment specification (in inches as depicted on Fig. 8),<br>
and ESg = enlarged garment specification 14.<br>
This process is repeated for every measurement necessary for garment 18 until all of the pieces are accounted for.  For formula 34a these measurements include; top collar, coUarband, chest, waist, bottom, shoulder, arm hole, body length, side seam, net sleeve, sleeve length combined, cuff width, cuff height, sleeve placket, sh sleeve length sh sleeve hemispherical circumference, collar point length, tie space, and cf placket width. The results are use to populate enlarged gannent specification table 44, which, when viewed in printout 27, provides the user with all of the information necessary to produce a final garment 18.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, a sample calculation performed by before wash processor 25 for the collar in formula 36a (master woven shirt #1) is described using the following:<br>
Master woven shin #1 - collar<br>
shrinkage results (221) - 8.33%; working shrinkage results (301) -<br>
9.02389%<br>
garment specification (12) 16.00"<br>
modification percentage (36) 60%<br>
shrinkage amount (40) = 60% x 9.02389% x 16.00" = 0.86629"<br>
enlarged garment specification (14) = 16.00" + 0.87" = 16.87"<br>
More complicated calculations occur when the particular piece of garment 18 being modified included measurements along both the length and width axes.  Such calculations occur in situations such as the armhole and sleeve length modifications, as illustrated by shrinkage result orientation table 39 on printout 27 as seen in Fig. 8.<br>
These calculations include the use of both working shrinkage results 301 and 30w. The calculation for the armhole in this cases uses both working shrinkage results 301 and 30w to calculate the appropriate enlarged garment specification 14.<br>
Before-wash processor 25, using a combination fraction 48, in conjunction with the equation listed above the armhole calculation, utilizes the following modified equation<br>
Sg + (Sg (Zw) (Xw%) (Y%)) + (Sg (ZI) (Xl%) (Y%))<br>
where Xw = working shrinkage results (width), XI = working shrinkage results (length), Y= modification percentage, Zw - combination )      fraction (width), Zl = combination fraction (length), Sg = garment specification (in inches as depicted on Fig. 8), and ESg = enlarged garment specification.<br>
In an exemplary calculation of the armhole shrinkage amount 40 and enlarged garment specification 14, the calculations are as follows:<br>
Master woven shirt #1 - armhole<br>
shrinkage results (221) - 8.33%; working shrinkage results (301) -9.02389%<br>
shrinkage results (22w) - 3.12%; working shrinkage results (301) -3.21734%<br>
garment specification (12) 22.88" modification percentage (36) 60% combination fraction (48w) -7/12 combination fraction (481) - 17/30<br>
Enlarged garment specification (14) = 22.88" + [(22.88" 7/12) (3.21734%)(60%)] + [(22.88 17/30) (9.02389%)(60%)] = 22.88" + 2576 + .7187 = 23.85"<br>
As illustrated in this calculation, enlarged garment specification 14 is calculated using both working shrinkage results 301 and 30w.  Combination fractions 481 and 48w are derived from the ratio of length fabric to width fabric used in a particular garment piece measurement, the armhole in this case, and then modifying it for overlap. Combination fractions 48 are stored in formula table 15, and sent to before wash processor 25 along with the accompanying modification percentages 36. As is illustrated in formula 34a, armhole measurement, the combination fractions 481 and 48w exceed 1.0 (1 3/20) which implies that some of the length and width shrinkages will overlap slightly at the<br>
meeting point for these measurements.<br>
Also illustrated in Fig. 8 the sleeve measurement requires both length and width measurements as well, however, system 24 does not directly utilize working shrinkage results 30w and 301 but instead uses shrinkage amount 40, as stored in shrinkage amount table 42, from two other garment pieces, the shoulder (which uses 30w) and the net sleeve (which uses 30w).<br>
Different formulas 34 can be used by system 24 which employ many different equations to calculate enlarged garment specification 14 from garment specification 12.  The above listed example was only an example of one formula 34 for using with system 24, however many different formulas 44 are available, which are described in more detail below. Additionally, any system mat utilizes similar calculations to account from bulk wash shrinkage are within the contemplation of the present invention.  Different garment 18 types, different cut styles and different bulk wash formulas may employ several variations to the standard equations used.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, various formulas 34a-341 exist for use with system 24 for use with different fabric types or different garment types to account for the differences in modification percentages 36 necessary to adjust working shrinkage results 30, As discussed above, such factors as the variations in the stitching of garment pieces such as the collar and cuffs, stretch properties of the fabric, bulk wash formulas used and the use of long or short sleeves, give rise to the need for formulas 34a-341 to utilize different modification percentages 36    Formulas 34a 341 listed below are only samples of<br>
formulas 34 that can be used in conjunction with this program.<br>
In this embodiment, an exemplary discussion of the origin of some of shrinkage percentages 36 for formulas 34a-341 follows. These formulas 34a-341 are intended as examples of shrinkage percentages 36 as used on certain types of garmentslS and is no way intended to limit the scope of the present invention. Any system 24 which incorporates the use of estimated shrinkage percentages 36, to modify garment specifications 12 as described above is within the contemplation of this invention.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, as illustrated in Figs. 8-12, formulas 34a -34e have the following base formula; Master woven shirt formula #l-#5 w/body at X%-Y% breakdown of 100% shrinkage w/collar and band at Z%", where X% and Y% represent shrinkage modification percentages related to the back cut of the shirt at the annhole and along the rest of the length measurement of the back below the armhole, respectively, and the Z% shrinkage is the shrinkage percentage out of 100% that in the collar and band will experience.<br>
Formula 34a, entitled "Master woven shirt formula #1 w/body at 60% +40% breakdown of 100% shrinkage, w/collar and band at 60%" is used mostly for higher count fabrics with the collar lining on straight and collarband on a 9 degree bias, where bias refers to the cut angle of the lining pads.  Formula 34b, entitled "Master woven shirt formula #1 w/body at 60% +40% breakdown of 100% shrinkage, w/collar and band at 65%" is used for mostly the same purpose as formula 34a except that 5% of sew shrinkage is added to the collar and the collarband to be used as desired.  This adjustment to the collar band is to account for the bias lining cut variations.<br>
Formula 34c, entitled "Master woven shirt formula #1 w/body at 60%+40% breakdown of 100% shrinkage, w/collar and band at 70%", is used for the same fabrics that formulas 34a and 34b are used except that the collar and the collarband use 70% of working shrinkage results 301, because when the lining of the collar and the collarband are at a 45 degree bias they will shrink more due to less resistance to shrinkage.  Formula 34d, entitled "Master woven shirt formula #1 w/body at 60%+40% breakdown of 100% shrinkage, w/collar and band at 75%" is used in the same situation as formula 34c except that there is 5% more allowance for shrinkage in the collar and collar band. Formula 34e, entitled "Master woven shin formula til w/body at 70%+30% breakdown of 100% shrinkage, w/collar and band at 70%", is used when the fabric has less resistance to shrinkage.  This formula 34e also has a 75% allowance for bias lining in the collar and the collarband.<br>
Additionally, woven shirt formulas 34a-34e allow for alterations of<br>
the front armholes at tire shoulder seams to match the different percentages of growth in the yoke shoulder seams. These formulas 34a-34e also allow for alterations of the top of the back armholes so that the top of the backs will match the yoke lengths.<br>
In one embodiment of die present invention, as illustrated in Figs 13-17, formulas 34f-34j have the following base formula; Master knit formula #1-3,5-6 W-A%, L-B%, SL-C%, using D% - E% breakdown or 100% shrinkage. Here A%, B% and C% refer to the overall shrinkage amounts along three separate measurements, length, width, and sleeve lengdi and where D% and E% represent the percent of overall shrinkage along the length of the back at the armhole and along the remaining length of me back, respectively.   The A%, B% and C% show mat the knit formulas when stitched may display additional restraint in overall shrinkage along the width and the sleeve length due to properties inherent in the knit fabrics and reaction to tumbling in the bulk wash.<br>
Formula 341", entitled "Master knit formula  #1 W-100%, L-100%, SL-100%, using 80% +20% breakdown or 100% shrinkage" is used in standard knit shins which do not display much resistance to shrinkage. The 80%(D%)+20%(E%) is the formula breakdown of 100% shrinkage corresponding to the shrinkage percentage 36 used in the body area.<br>
The remaining formulas; 34g entitled "Master knit formula #2 W-100%, L-100%, SL-95%, using 80%+ 20% breakdown or 100% shrinkage"; 34h entitled "Master knit formula #3 W-100%, L-100%, SL-90%, using 80%+20% breakdown or 100% shrinkage";34i entitled "Master knit formula #5 W-100%, L-<br>
100%, SL-75%, using 80%+20% breakdown or 100% shrinkage"; arid 34j entitled "Master knit formula #6 W-100%, L-100%, SL-60%, using 80%+20% breakdown or 100% shrinkage" represent variations pertaining to the stretching qualities and shrinkage resistance qualities found in garments 18 sleeve lengths due to shrinkage resistance caused by the stitching.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, as illustrated in Figs. 18 and 19, formulas 34k and 341 have the basic formula "Master woven pant formula#l-2 L-A%, W-B%, Apex-C% from W-0% * L-0%" where A%, B% refer to the width and length shrinkage adjustments used for modification percentages 36.  C% refers to the apex shrinkage adjustment used for modification percentage 36 that include measurements near the seat of the pants. The terms "From W-0% * L-0%" simply means that the A%, B% and C% are applied directly to the garment specificationsl2.<br>
For example, formula 34k, entitled "Master woven pant formula#2 L-75%, W-100%, Apex-20% from W-0% * L-0%", the first 75% is length modification percentage 36 for the front and back body lengths. The 100% corresponds to shrinkage percentage 36 for the front and back body patterns, and the 20% shrinkage percentage 36 corresponds to the amount mat the crotch is raised to achieve a 55% extension for the front rise because the zipper will resist further shrinkage.<br>
Here the back crotch is being raised with front crotch but it is blended to back rise line.  The raising of the crotch by a shrinkage percentage 36<br><br>
of 20% also increases the inseam length shrinkage allowance to 95%. However, the side seam shrinkage percentage 36 remains 75%.<br>
Additionally, in order to be able to set waistband to the pant, formula 34k provides for an alteration at top of fly, top of back rise &amp; top of back rise seam. These aherations will match the waist measurements of the body width to the lengtli measurements of the waistband allowing for stretch while setting.  If fabric has a lot of widuh stretch, formula 34k could be changed to allow more stretch of waistband while setting.<br>
Formula 341, entitled "Master woven pant formula  L-75%, W-95%, Apex-20% from W-0% * L-0%" is used when the width of the fabric has more stretch quality than normal.<br>
While only certain features of the invention have been illustrated and described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes or equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is therefore, to be understood that is application is intended to cover all such modifications and changes that fall within the true spirit of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
