				<td>1. Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus for deburring with planing tools a metal<br>
strand cut to length by gas cutting, which planing tools are adjustably held each<br>
for themselves transversally to the metal strand in a support, and with a drive<br>
for the relative advancing movement of the planing tools relative to the metal<br>
strand which is cut to length.<br>
2. Description of the Prior Art<br>
When metal strands produced by continuous strand casting are cut to length by<br>
gas cutting, a cutting burr is produced on the exit side of the cutting jet which<br>
causes a disturbance in further processing the cut metal strands and is there-<br>
fore removed. It is therefore known for this purpose in the case of plate slabs,<br>
i.e. metal strands with a substantially rectangular cross section, (DE 30 37 320<br>
C2) to arrange several planing tools transversally to the longitudinal direction of<br>
the plate slabs on a carriage displaceable in the longitudinal direction of the<br>
plate slab and to advance each of them to the bottom side of the plate slab<br>
having the cutting burr in order to move the carriage by a forward drive after the<br>
advancement of the planing tools against the plate slab outside of the cutting<br>
burr and to remove said cutting burr according to the advancement of the plan-<br>
ing tools by machining. The use of this known apparatus for deburring plate<br>
slabs is not suitable for the deburring of billets obtained by the cutting to length<br>
of metal strands with a round cross section.<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
In another known apparatus for deburring a metal strand cut into length by gas<br>
cutting (EP 0 671 230 A1), the planing tools are provided on piston bodies<br>
which are held in a radially displaceable manner in a common tubular cylinder<br>
body and can be pressurized by means of compressed air in order to ensure<br>
the advancement of the planing tools against the metal strand under a prede-<br>
termined force. The feeding of the planing tools occurs via radial displacement<br>
of the cylinder body extending parallel to the strand axis. When the planing<br>
tools hit the metal strand they are pushed from an initial position limited by a<br>
stop into the cylinder body against the pressurization pressure. By adjusting the<br>
hollow cylinder body to a circumferential surface of a billet which is round in its<br>
cross section, e.g. by a helical progress of the cylinder body relative to the billet<br>
axis, it is managed to also deburr billets which have a round cross section,<br>
which applies to several adjacent diameter sizes when the individual piston<br>
bodies are arranged axially behind each other and offset from one another in<br>
the circumferential direction. The disadvantageous aspect is the constructional<br>
complexity following the necessary advancement of the cylinder body, espe-<br>
cially when it is necessary to provide two cylinder bodies which are opposite of<br>
each other with respect to the billet to be deburred. Despite providing two cylin-<br>
der bodies with piston bodies each carrying a set of planing tools, it is not pos-<br>
sible to achieve a machining of the billets which is even over the circumference.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is thus based on the object of arranging an apparatus for de-<br>
burring a metal strand cut into length by gas cutting in such a way that advan-<br>
tageous constructional conditions are obtained for the removal of the cutting<br>
burr of metal strands of round cross section which are cut to length.<br>
Based on a deburring apparatus of the kind mentioned above, this object is<br>
achieved by the invention in such a way that the annular support comprises at<br>
least two sets of planing tools which are radially adjustable to the metal strand<br>
cut to length, which sets are arranged behind one another in the longitudinal di-<br>
- 3 -<br><br>
rection of the metal strand cut to length and which are staggered against each<br>
other set by set.<br>
The provision of two sets of mutually staggered planing tools which can be ad-<br>
justed radially relative to the metal strand cut to length offers a simple possibil-<br>
ity of fully deburring cut metal strands of different diameter because a cutting<br>
sequence of the individual planing tools which closes over the circumference is<br>
obtained at different strand diameters through the mutual offset of the planing<br>
tool sets which are arranged behind one another in the longitudinal direction of<br>
the metal strand in the case of respective overlapping of the mutually offset<br>
planing tools. The precondition is an annular support for the planing tools,<br>
which support encloses the metal strand to be deburred and which planing<br>
tools are each adjustable themselves radially to the cut metal strand relative to<br>
the non-displaceable support. The radial tool sets further constitute an advan-<br>
tageous precondition for the complete deburring of the cut metal strand without<br>
having any knowledge of the circumferential position of the cutting burr. The<br>
planing tools of the tool sets merely need to be distributed over the entire cir-<br>
cumference for this purpose.<br>
The advancement for deburring the cut metal strand can also be achieved by<br>
displacing the support relative to the stationary held metal strand. Especially<br>
advantageous conditions are obtained however when the feeding drive com-<br>
prises a punch for the cut metal strand which rests on the punch by the annular<br>
support, which punch extends in the direction of the metal strand and acts on<br>
the face side of the end of the cut metal strand to be deburred. When pressur-<br>
ized in a respective manner, the punch moves the metal strand relative to the<br>
planing tools radially pressed against the metal strand under removal of the<br>
cutting burr by the annular support. No additional fixing is required for cutting<br>
the metal strand that is cut to length and no drive is needed for the support.<br>
The table roller which needs to be provided anyway for feeding and removing<br>
the metal strands to be deburred can thus advantageously be used as a guide<br>
means for the metal strand during the advancing movement by the punch.<br>
- 4 -<br><br>
When the punch is pressurized by means of an actuating cylinder, said punch<br>
can also be used as a braking stop for the metal strands supplied via the table<br>
roller, which metal strands are conveyed with their ends to be deburred through<br>
the annular support against the punch and are braked by the same, when after<br>
applying the planing tools against the respective metal strand outside of its cut-<br>
ting burr the metal strand is subjected to a deburring feed with the help of the<br>
stamp against the direction of supply and to eject the same from the apparatus<br>
again.<br>
Especially simple constructional conditions are obtained with respect to the ar-<br>
rangement of the planing tools when the support comprises at least two support<br>
rings for a set of planing tools each, because in this case the support rings with<br>
the planing tools can be arranged with a configuration so as to coincide. It is<br>
merely necessary to ensure a respective angular offset of the support rings in<br>
order to obtain a ring of planing tools which is closed in the circumferential di-<br>
rection. In the case of two support rings, the angle of offset between the two<br>
support rings corresponds to half the angular distance between two adjacent<br>
planing tools of a planing tool set in the case of an even distribution of the two<br>
support rings. The angle of offset decreases accordingly with the number of<br>
support rings.<br>
For the purpose of mutual fixing of the support rings, an axial clamping device<br>
can be provided which clamps the support rings on an abutment. When such<br>
abutment belongs to a carriage which can be displaced in a frame, the appara-<br>
tus can be adjusted easily by displacement of the carriage to different diame-<br>
ters of the metal strands conveyed on a stationary table roller. The alignment of<br>
the support rings relative to the strand axis which changes in its height with the<br>
strand diameter as a result of the stationary strand support does not have to be<br>
especially precise due to the individual application of the planing tools.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>

The subject matter of the invention is shown in the drawing by way of example,<br>
wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a simplified side view of an apparatus in accordance with the in-<br>
vention for deburring a metal strand cut to length;<br>
Fig. 2 shows this apparatus in a partly sectional top view;<br>
Fig. 3 shows a sectional view along the line Ill-Ill of Fig. 1, and<br>
Fig. 4 shows a support ring in a sectional view in the area of a planing tool in<br>
an axial sectional view on an enlarged scale.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The illustrated apparatus for deburring a metal strand 1 which is cut to length<br>
by gas cutting comprises a frame 2 in which a carriage 3 can be displaced with<br>
respect to height by means of lifting cylinders 4. Carriage 3 forms a support<br>
tube 5 on which a support 6 for planing tools 7 is suspended. Said support 6 is<br>
composed in the illustrated embodiment from three support rings 8 which are<br>
arranged in the longitudinal direction of the cut metal strand 1 behind one an-<br>
other and can be fixedly clamped in the axial direction on an abutment 11 of<br>
carriage 3 by means of a clamping device 9 in the form of screw drives 10 for<br>
example. The support rings 8 which can each be suspended themselves on the<br>
support tube 5 are provided with radial guide means 12 for the planing tools 7,<br>
which guide means are distributed evenly over the circumference and whose<br>
carriers 13 which are displaceably held in the guide means 12 can be displaced<br>
by means of actuating drives 14 for advancing the planing tools 7 to the metal<br>
strand 1 to be machined, e.g. with the help of actuating cylinders. The ar-<br>
rangement is made in such a way that the support rings 8 which are arranged<br>
so as to coincide are arranged in a mutually angularly offset manner, so that a<br>
staggered configuration is obtained for the sets of planing tools which are as-<br>
sociated with each support ring 8, thus producing a ring of planing tools 7 which<br>
is closed over the circumference. Since three support rings 8 are provided in<br>
the embodiment, this means that the individual support rings 8 need to be off-<br>
- 6 -<br><br>
set from each other by an angle which corresponds to one-third of the angular<br>
distance of two adjacent planing tools 7 of a support ring 8.<br>
In addition to the support 6 for the radially adjustable planing tools 7, the car-<br>
riage 3 also carries a punch 15 which impinges upon the face side of the metal<br>
strand 1 and which can be pressurized by the actuating cylinder 16. The asso-<br>
ciation is chosen in such a way that the punch 15 which extends coaxially to<br>
the support rings 8 is displaced with the help of the actuating cylinder 16<br>
through the support rings 8 in order to subject the metal strand 1 resting on the<br>
face side of the punch 15 on a table roller to a respective advancing movement<br>
for deburring.<br>
In order to debur a cut metal strand 1 in the form of a billet with round cross<br>
section, the metal strand 1 is brought forward via the table roller 17, with an ad-<br>
justment of the apparatus to the respective diameter of the metal strand 1 being<br>
made by means of a height displacement of the carriage 3.<br>
The punch 15 which is coaxial to the support 6 is aligned at least approximately<br>
to the strand axis. The punch 15 which is advanced via the actuating cylinder<br>
16 against the arriving metal strand 1 can also be used advantageously as a<br>
brake stop in order to thus brake the metal strand 1 in such a way that the end<br>
18 to be deburred which impinges upon the punch 15 protrudes from the annu-<br>
lar support 6, as is shown in the drawing. In this position of the metal strand 1,<br>
the planing tools 7 are situated axially outside of the cutting burr area to be re-<br>
moved. The respective contour of the metal strand 1 is detected and copied<br>
with the radial advancement of the planing tools 7 via the actuating cylinders 14,<br>
so that deburring can occur in accordance with this contour- For this purpose,<br>
the actuating cylinder 16 for the punch 15 is pressurized as an advancing drive<br>
with the consequence the metal strand 1 is pushed out of the apparatus by<br>
punch 15 opposite of the incoming direction, with the cutting burr being re-<br>
moved to an extent which corresponds to the excess portion determined by the<br>
application of the planing tools 7.<br>
