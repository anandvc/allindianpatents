This invention relates to a bar pulling arm in all CNC turning center.<br>
Bar pulling is a technique which is ever evolving into better and still better methods calling for specialized skill and precise technical knowledge. Previously bar feeder unit is required (electromechanical and hydraulic bar feeder is available) in that for bar feeding continuously motor is running so electrical power is consumed. Hydraulic oil required in case of hydraulic bar feed unit. Machining bar and bar feeder bar, both occupied more (space) length so gives more vibration, we can't give high rpm, So cycle time is more. While working change the insert or some small work by mistake open the collect or chuck bar will be comeout seriously accident occurs. Bar feeder unit occupied more area, stopper and bar feeder is different and cost is too high.<br>
Another novel method is to use bar pulling arm suitably located and clamped on the holder for a variety of methods. In this arrangement the cost of the bar pulling arm comparatively very less and after usage, only the bar suitable arm have to be replaced, whereas the arm and holder is not damaged or worn out as in the case mentioned above.<br>
The present invention has for the object to provide a Bar pulling arm assembly to be used on all CNC Turning Centers and other auto special purpose machines. The bar pulling arm is clamp on the turret like normal tools it is very simple 'C shape profile arm. An arm we can change easily for different size bar like parting blade, extra power is not required for pulling the bar.<br>
Necessity of new bar pulling arm innovation came because of continuous production to reduce the schedule time and to increase the productivity. Bar pulling arm can be used on all CNC turning centers and auto lathes which having auto clamping and unclamping facility, (chuck or collet)<br>
There is no need of a bar feed unit. When working with bar feed unit to control the length of the component a stopper is fixed in one of the station in the turret. Instead of that stopper a bar pulling arm can be fixed and bar can be pulled from the front and clamped the bar, which is to be machined as per drawing.<br>
For different size of rod, different arm has to be used. This can be easily changed like a parting blade and cycle time can be reduced.<br><br>
To pull the bar, groove is made at the end of bar and pull the bar to the required length, carryout all the operations as per dimension, then part off the component and made groove for next job pulling. Same steps is followed for Mass Production till the bar completion.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a Bar pulling assembly which can, easily be adapted to CNC turning centers and hold the bar firmly during the bar pulling of the CNC lathe or like machine to which the bar pulling arms may be fixed on turret.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to provide a simple and economical bar pulling assembly.<br>
With these and other objectives in view, this invention provides different bar pulling arm comprising of a pulling arm and a slit bush, the said arm holder having a shank, one end of which is to be fitted in a machine turret and the other end is provided for sitting on groove of bar, the said arm having identical profile at one end thereof depending upon the nature of the pulling for which it is required, the pulling portions of the arm having a locking on bar groove predetermined value, means provided at the said other end of the shank for holding the said arm and to be clamped by the said clamping device, the said means comprising a recess or pocket the base of which is perpendicular in a direction opposition to the machine axis, the said arm also being provided with recess on the face of holder being located in the recess or pocket on the arm holder, and to be held in position by the clamping device, and wherein the said clamping device is provided with means such as an extension, on the bar pulling arm holder.<br>
The bar pulling arm are 'C shaped and has a straight form on its bar groove at one end. The clamping device comprises of a pivotally mounted clamping element having a projection at one and to hold the bar resting on the said bar groove.<br>
The clamping device may also comprise a clamping element having a projection at one end thereof to be seated over the arm to hold the same lock on bar and pull the required length and come back normal position and an extension at the other end thereof, the said extension being disposed in a allot, recess, or the like on the tool holder.<br><br>
The clamping element is held on the tool holder by means, such as a screw. The axis of the arm may be perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the tool<br>
holder.<br>
An embodiment of this invention is now illustrated by way of example in the drawings accompanying this specification.<br>

DIFFERENT BAR PULLING METHODS<br>
(1) Grooving (2) Slit bush and (3) Magnet<br>
In these three methods, only two methods are more useful.   They are grooving and slit bush. 1. GROOVING METHOD:<br>
This method can be used widely when the supplied bar outside diameter (OD) is rough and normally OD operation is common in all machining components. So we can make groove on 3D, for pulling the bar. Bar can be pull with help of bar pulling arm groove depth and width has to maintain as per arm size. When the Bar pulling arm is locked on the groove (X-axis) a lengthy job can be pulled easily. Required length is pulled and after the operations has been done again a groove is made (space has to be left for making groove) again required length is pulled and supported by<br><br>
tailstock and remaining operations can be carried out. Similarly making required number of grooves should pull any amount of length. Any material (ferrous or non ferrous) can be pull &amp; there is no limit for pulling the bar length.<br>
2.	SLIT BUSH METHOD :<br>
When the supplied bar is smooth or polished, slit bush is used for pulling the bar to the required length to carry out the operation without any additional operation (Groove).<br>
With this method any amount of length can be pulled, instead of groove on the job there will be a groove on the slit bush. Slit bush is fixed on the bar tightly, the arm sit on the groove and pull the slit bush along with the bar to required length (when the chuck is unlocked), then the bar is clamped and arm pushes the slit bush back to its original position and carry out all the operation as per dimensions. The part off the component and same above steps followed for mass production till the bar completion.<br>
3.	MAGNETIC METHOD:<br>
By using magnetic method any dia and possible length of ferrous material bar can be pulled to the required length for machining component.<br>
In place of a stopper used in the turret a magnet has to be fixed and bar can be pulled. Like bar feed unit in this method, length of bar that can be pulled depends on maximum 'Z' axis length. It also depends on distance from rod face to maximum distance of turret can travel away from the rod face (limited Length).<br>
To machine a maximum dia rod a powerful magnet is enough. This is useful for all smaller dia rods. Length of a rod should be 1 meter or 2 meters which ever is convenient.<br>
Bars pulled in this method will not effect the magnetic properties of component because the face is machined. Magnet should be fixed in the turret opposite to the tools which remove chips, care has been taken to see that chips do not get struck to the Magnet.<br><br>
BAR PULLING PARTS AND EXPLANATION: Holder, Arm, and Slit Bush.<br>
HOLDER: It is common to both grooving as well as slit bush method.<br>
Holder is fixed in the turret like a tool, and the arm is fixed in the holder with help of bolts. The arm holder is fabricated in such a way that the arm is exactly in the center height of the M/c Spindle and &amp; perpendicular to the Z.-axis.<br>
ARM: It is mainly used to pull the bar. Arm is fixed in the holder with the help of bolts. Different size arms are required for different dia bars. The ends of the CC clamp (half circle) arm is projected straightly.<br>
This arm after sitting in the groove in half circle is slightly projected. It will be holding the bar to machines center axis, then it pulls the bar to required length as per the program.<br>
The bar pulling arm is designed such a way that it pulls the bar and care has been taken to maintain center height of spindle axis.<br>
Which is the bars used in the bar feed unit, which can be pulled by arm. As collet varies for different dia of bars similarly arm also varies.<br>
SLIT BUSH: Slit bush outer dia (OD) has a groove for the arm to sit and there will be a slit on one side. Internal Dia (ID) of slit bush is less than the OD of the bar. This will help the slit bush to sit tightly on the bar. There is a radius on one side of the ID. This radius helps the slit bush to enter the rod and move on it easily<br>
Different dia rods different slit bush with arm is required. When seating the slit bush, internal radius side should be enter on the bar. Then it should be tapped slowly, so that the slit bush sits on the rod tightly. When the slit bush seats on the bar tightly then to pull the bar as required length along with pulling arm.<br>
To pull the bar or pushes slit bush, machine cutting force is enough. If bar size various machine size and capacity of cutting force also varies.<br><br>
Futures : Holder :<br>
(1)	We can make sliding groove for arm and clamping from top side of bolts.<br>
(2)	It can be made different size arm front and back side in the blade is fitted in holder.<br>
(3)	Holder can be made 'V groove fitted the adjustable arm for different bar.<br>
Arm :<br>
(1)	Adjustable arm can be make in small variation in bars.<br>
(2)	"U" shape three point contact on bar or slit bush can be made.<br>
(3)	Different size of arm on both ends of arm can be made in single piece.<br>
(4)	We can make arm sliding in groove and externally clamping by bolts avoiding the side clamping bolts.<br>
(5)	We can make mark for center height checking for future development.<br>
Slit Bush :<br>
(1)	We can make angle internal dia in the slit bush in spindle direction for easy movement while pushing the slit bush in the direction of spindle and more rigid for pulling the bar.<br>
(2)	We can make spanner (like circlips spanner) with locking pins, the pin guide in holes in the slit bush, the holes are near the slit both sides. For easy fitted on the bar and we can remove easily.<br>
(3)	we can make more strength for pulling the bar, by providing bolts at slit position.<br>
Magnetic Block:<br>
(1)	We can provide on and off switch, it helps to vary the magnetic power for pulling the different bars.<br>
(2)	We can make round magnetic block holding back side of the round magnetic without shank instead of rectangle shape lengthy block provided.<br><br><br><br>
THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION :<br>
1.	Expensive bar feeding unit not required.<br>
2.	M/cs without bar feeding unit can also be used for mass production.<br>
3.	Floor area saved.<br>
4.	Hydraulic oil saved.<br>
