				<td>The present invention relates to a front cowl structure for a motorcycle. Technical filed of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a new structure for mounting a front number plate on a front portion of a motorcycle.<br>
Related Art<br>
A front number plate of this type  is required to  be  mounted  on a motorcycle used for a specific area such as<br>
India. For example, there has been known a motorcycle in which stays project forward from a head lamp and an oblong number plate is mounted to leading ends of the stays.<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
The above structure for mounting a front number plate, however, has a problem that since special stays and the like are required to be provided, the number of steps of manufacturing bodies and also a body structure is complicated. In view of the foregoing, an object of the present invention is to solve such a problem.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a front cowl structure for a motorcycle in which a front cowl (10) for covering a head lamp (12) is disposed in front of an upper portion of a front fork (2), characterized in that, there is provided a plate mounting recessed portion (43) at a lower portion of the front cowl (10) and is stepped-in rearward in a side view and is in an inverse U-shape in the front view wherein an oblong number (14) plate is provided with a lower portion of said front cowl (10) under said head lamp (12).<br>
According to a second invention, in addition to the configuration of the first invention, the number plate is removably mouted on the front cowl.<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
According to the first invention, since the oblong number plate is provided integrally with a lower portion of the front cowl under the head lamp, the number plate can be simply mounted by eliminating the need of extension of special stays and the like from the head lamp side, that is, by making use of the front cowl. As a result, it is possible to reduce the number of steps of manufacturing bodies, and also to simplify a body structure. [0007]<br>
According to the second invention, since the number plate is removably mounted on the front cowl, the number plate can be removed for making an entry of a vehicular number.  This is effective to improve the handling performance.<br>

[Embodiment of the Invention]<br>
Hereinafter, an embodiment in which the present invention is applied to a motorcycle will be described with reference to the drawings. Fig. 1 is a general side view<br>
of a motorcycle according to this embodiment; Fig. 2 is a<br>
plan view of the motorcycle shown in Fig. 1; Fig. 3 is a view showing a side surface shape of a front cowl portion;<br>
Fig. 4 is a view showing a front surface shape of the front cowl portion; Fig. 5 is a side view showing how to mount a number plate; Fig. 6 is a front view showing how to mount the number plate; and Fig. 7 is a sectional view taken on line 7-7 of Fig. 6. [0009]<br>
First, a schematic structure of the motorcycle will be described with reference to Figs. 1 and 2. A front wheel 1 is supported between a pair of right and left leg portions of a telescopic type front fork 2. The front fork 2 is connected to a head pipe 5 through a bottom bridge 3 and a top bridge 4. [0010]<br>
The head pipe 5 turnably supports a steering shaft 6 around which the front fork 2 is turnable. A pipe-like main frame 7 is welded to front edge portions of the down pipes 8. [0011]<br>
A handlebar 9 is supported on the top bridge 4, and a front cowl 10 is supported in front of the top bridge 4 and the bottom bridge 3. An instrument panel 11, a head lamp 12 and a horn 13 are disposed inside the front cowl 10, and a number plate 14 is mounted at a lower end portion of the front cowl 10.<br>
[0012]<br>
The main frame 7 extends rearward substantially in the horizontal direction, being bent downward, and is connected to a pivot bracket 15. A four-cycle engine 16 is supported by the pivot bracket 15 and the down pipes 8.<br>
[0013]<br>
Front end portions of rear swing arms 18 are turnably connected to a pivot 17 of the pivot bracket 15, and a rear wheel 19 is supported by rear end portions of the rear swing arms 18. A chain 22 is wound around a driven sprocket 20 provided coaxially with the rear wheel 19 and a drive sprocket 21 of the four-cycle engine 16. [0014]<br>
A pair of right and left seat rails 23 extend rearward from the vicinity of the bent portion of the main frame 7, and rear stays 24 are obliquely connected between intermediate portions of the seat rails 23 and the pivot bracket 15. [0015]<br>
A reinforcing plate 25 is provided in the vicinity of each of the connecting portions between the seat rails 23 and the rear stays 24, and a damper 26 of a rear wheel suspension is provided between the reinforcing plate 25 and a rear portion of the rear swing arm 18.<br>
[0016]<br>
A sari/guard 27 is disposed on one side surface (left side in this embodiment) of the rear wheel 19 in such a manner as to extend in the vertical direction. An upper portion of the sari guard 27 is mounted to one of the reinforcing plates 25, and a lower portion of the sari guard 27 constitutes a sari-side step 28 projecting downward. A bracket 29 is provided on a lower front portion of the sari guard 27. [0017]<br>
The lower front portion of the sari guard 27 is supported on a rear portion of one of step holders 30 through the bracket 29. The step holders 30 are a pair of right and left members which are mounted on right and left sides of the pivot bracket 15 in such a manner as to be coaxial with the pivot 17 and extend longer rearward. [0018]<br>
Each of the right and left step holders 30 has a driver's step 32 mounted on its front end portion side and also has a passenger's step 31 mounted on its rear end portion side. The rear end portion of the left step holder 30 extends rearward from the passenger's step 31 and is connected to the bracket 29. [0019]<br>
In addition, the passenger's steps 31 and the driver's steps 32 are steps for riding in a saddling manner. In the figures, reference numeral 33 indicates a carburetor; 34 is an air cleaner; 35 is a fuel tank; 36 is a tandem seat; and 37 is a rear cowl. [0020]<br>
Next, the front cowl 10 will be described in detail. As shown in Figs. 3 to 6, the front cowl 10 is a resin made member disposed over the front fork 2 and in front of the head pipe 5. A mounting edge 40 formed into an approximately U-shape in a .front view is formed on an upper portion of the front cowl 10, and a transparent screen 41 is mounted to the mounting edge 40 with small screws (Fig. 4). [0021]<br>
An opening 42 for a head lamp is formed in a central portion of the front cowl 10, and a lens portion of the head lamp 12 disposed inside the front cowl 10 faces to the opening 42. [0022]<br>
A lower portion of the front cowl 10 at a position under the head lamp 12 is formed with a plate mounting recessed portion 43. The plate mounting recessed portion 43 is stepped-in rearward in a side view and is formed in<br>
an approximately inverse-U shape in a front view. The number plate 14 is removably mounted to the plate mounting recessed portion 43. [0023]<br>
A portion of the front cowl 10, which is overlapped on the horn 13 disposed over the number plate 14 and under the head lamp 12, constitutes a louver portion 44. As shown in Fig. 5, the louver portion 44 is provided with a plurality of slits 44a for making easy transmission of an alarm whistle generated by the horn 13 to the outside of the front cowl 10. [0024]<br>
The number plate 14 is an oblong member. Right and left end portions of the number plate 14 are mounted on the front cowl 10 side with a pair of small screws 45. As is apparent from Figs. 5 and 6, the upper louver portion 44 and a lower marking portion 46 are integrally molded using a suitable resin material. ,<br>
[0025]<br>
The marking portion is a smooth surface portion formed into a rectangular shape substantially longer sideways in a front view. A vehicular number can be arbitrarily marked on the marking portion 46 by writing or engraving. As shown in Fig. 5, the surface of the number<br>
plate 14 is entirely curved with a central portion in the width direction projecting forward so as to be matched with a curved surface of the front cowl 10. [0026]<br>
As is apparent from Fig. 6, through-holes 47 for the small screws 45 are formed in the right and left end portions of the louver portion 44, and a pair of right and left claw pieces 49 project upward from an upper edge portion of the louver portion 44 with a central cutout portion 48 being put therebetween.  In addition, the cross-sectional portion of the number plate 14 in Fig. 5 is equivalent to that taken on line 5-5 of Fig. 6. [0027]<br>
Besides, right and left supporting portions 50 each being formed into a stepped shape are provided on the plate mounting recessed portion 43 side. The louver portion 44 is to be superimposed on the right and left supporting portions 50.  Deep through-holes 51, which are substantially matched with the through-holes 47, are formed in the right and left supporting portions 50. [0028]<br>
A projecting portion 52 to be fitted in the cutout portion 48 projects downward from an upper central portion of the plate mounting recessed portion 43. Insertion holes<br>
54, into which the claw pieces 49 are to be inserted, are formed in a rearward extending upper wall portion 53 disposed on both sides of the projecting portion 52 (see Fig. 7). [0029]<br>
In the plate mounting recessed portion 43, a portion put between the right and left supporting portions 50 constitutes an opening portion 55, and a portion which is positioned under the opening portion 55 and on which the marking portion 46 is to be superimposed constitutes a supporting portion 56. The supporting portion 56 is a smooth surface portion curved at a curvature being nearly equal to that of the marking portion 46. [0030]<br>
As is apparent from Figs. 3 and 4, the front cowl 10 is supported on the body side by means of a cowl stay 60.  The cowl stay 60 includes a pair of right and left first stays 61; a pair of right and left second stays 62; a pair of right and left third stays 63; and a fourth stay 64 crossing in the lateral direction. These stays 61, 62, 63, and 64 are integrally formed.  In addition, as the structure of the cowl stay 60, there may be suitably used any one of known various structures. [0031]<br>
The cowl stay 60 is fixed on the bottom bridge 3 by fitting, from the upper side, leg portions 65 formed at a lower end portion of the cowl stay 60 in mounting holes formed in the bottom bridge 3. Flat portions 66 at an upper end of the cowl stay 66 are fastened on a front surface of the top bridge 4 with bolts 67. [0032]<br>
Each third stay 63 is a member for connecting the first stay 61 to the second stay 62. As shown in Fig. 3, brackets 71 and 72 are provided on upper and lower portions of the third stay 63.  The horn 13 is supported by the lower brackets 72. [0033]<br>
The fourth stay 64 crosses a space between upper portions of the right and left second stays 62 and connects the upper portions to each other.  In addition, an adjust bolt 57 is provided on the rear portion of the front cowl 10 at a position under the head lamp 12. The optical axis of the head lamp 12 can be adjusted by moving the position of the adjust bolt 57 in the longitudinal direction. [0034]<br>
Next, the function of this embodiment will be described. As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, the number plate 14 in this embodiment, which is provided separately from the front cowl 10, is superimposed and mounted on the front surface of the plate mounting recessed portion 43 from the lower side of the front cowl 10. [0035]<br>
To be more specific, the number plate 14 can be simply, removably mounted on the front cowl 10 at a position under the head lamp 12 only by inserting the claw pieces 49 in the insertion holes 54, and aligning the right and left through-holes 47 with the through-holes 51 on the plate mounting recessed portion 43 side and allowing the small screws 45 to pass through the through-holes 47 and 51, and fastening the small screws 45 with nuts 70 provided on flat portions 69 at the lower ends of the second stays 62. [0036]<br>
Since the marking portion 46 of the number plate 14 has the smooth surface, the vehicular number can be marked on the marking portion 46. When the marking of the vehicular number is requested for a supplier, the number plate 14 can be arbitrarily removed and carried, with a result that the handling performance can be improved. [0037]<br>
In a state in which the number plate 14 is mounted in the front cowl 10, the number plate 14 is viewed to be<br>
unified with the front cowl 10, thus achieving unification of design.  Further, since the marking portion 46 is formed into the curved surface having a curvature similar to that of the curved surface of the front cowl 10, it is possible to improve the aerodynamic performance. [0038]<br>
Since the supporting portion 56 for supporting the marking portion 46 has a structure similar to that of the marking portion 46, it can rigidly support the marking portion 46.  The supporting portion 56, although it is not removably provided, can also function as a number marking portion after the number plate 14 is removed. [0039]<br>
The louver portion 44, which is formed integrally with the upper portion of the marking portion 46 of the number plate 14, can be used as a design portion.  The louver portion 44 also has an effect of sufficiently transmitting an alarm whistle of the horn 13 inside the front cowl 10 to the outside through the slits 44a. [0040]<br>
'jSince the marking portion 46 is located, as seen, from the side, on the lower portion of the front cowl 10 at a position being lower than the head lamp 12 and extending far back on the rear side, it is possible to prevent the<br>
marking from being eliminated by rainwater or the like. [0041] .<br>
Since the number plate 14 can be mounted/dismounted by eliminating the need of provision of mounting portions such as special stays and the like, that is, by making use of the front cowl 10, the number of steps of manufacturing bodies can be correspondingly reduced and the body structure can be also simplified. Further, since the number plate 14 can be co-fastened with the mounting portions of the front cowl 10 using the second stays 62, it is possible to reduce the mounting steps and the number of parts. [0042]<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above embodiment and can be variously changed.  For example, the number plate 14 is not necessarily made from a resin but may be made from a metal.  In the case where the number plate 14 is made from a metal, the effect in terms of design can be enhanced.  Further, the louver portion 44 may be provided separately from the marking portion 46.<br>
