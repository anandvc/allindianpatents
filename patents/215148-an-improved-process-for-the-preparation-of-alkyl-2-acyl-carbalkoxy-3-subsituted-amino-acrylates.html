				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation alkyl 2-acyl/carbalkoxy-3-(substituted amino)acrylates of formula I in the drawing accompanying this specification, wherein R1 is selected from alkyl, R2 is selected from alkyl, aryl, alkoxy and R3 is selected from alkyl, cycloalkyl, arylalkyl. More particularly, it relates to the preparation of the said compounds using alkyl 3-trichloromethyl-2-acyl/carbalkoxyacrylates of formula II in the drawing accompanying this specification, wherein R1 is alkyl, R2 is selected from alkyl, aryl or alkoxy groups.<br>
The esters, alkyl 3-trichloromethyl-2-acyl/carbalkoxyacrylates of formula II can be produced according to the process which has been fully described in our copending Patent Application No. 1255/DEL/1994.<br>
The alkyl esters of formula I prepared according to the procedure described in the present invention can serve as an intermediate for IV1 generation quinolone antibiotics like norfloxacin, pefloxacin, ciprofloxacin etc. [Bouzard, D. In Recent Progress in the Chemical Synthesis of Antibiotics, Lukacs, G.; Ohno, M., Eds.; Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1990, p 249].<br>
In the prior art alkyl 2-carbalkoxy-3- (substituted amino)acrylates are prepared by reacting ethoxymethylenemalonic acid ester with substituted amines [Price, C.C.; Roberts, R.M., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1946, 68, 1204]. In our co-pending patents [Indian Patent Application Nos. 1453/DEL/95 &amp; 798/DEL/96], alkyl 2-carbalkoxy-3-(substituted amino/acrylates are prepared in two steps from alkyl 3-trichloromethyl-2-carbalkoxyacrylates of formula II by reacting it with substituted amines to get addition product, followed by elimination of trichloromethyl group. In another prior art alkyl 2-acyl-3-(substituted amino)-acrylates are prepared by reacting acyl halides with alkyl 3-substitued aminoacrylate [Grohe, K.; Heitzer, H. Liebgs Ann. Chem. 1987, 29]. In yet another method, alkyl 2-acy!-3-(substituted<br><br>
amino)acrylates were obtained in two steps by reacting ethyl formate with ß-keto ester followed by treatment of alkyl amines [Grohe, K.; Zeiler, H. J.; Metzger, K. Ger. Off en, DE 3,142,854, 1983].<br>
The drawback of this method that the starting material, ethoxymethylenemalonic acid ester, has to be obtained by the reaction of diethyl malonate and triethylorthoformate at high temperature. Moreover, this reaction gives lower yields of ethoxymethylenemalonic acid ester [Parham, W. E. and Reed, L. J. Org. Synth. Coll. Vol. 3, p395, 1955].<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of alkyl 2-acyl/carbalkoxy-3- (substituted amino)acrylates of formula I, which avoids the use of ethoxymethylenemalonic acid ester.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provided an improved process for alkyl 2-acyl/carbalkoxy-3- (substituted amino)acrylates of formula I starting from alkyl 3-trichloromethyl-2-acyl/carbalkoxyacrylates of formula II in a single operation.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of alkyl esters of formula I of the accompanying drawing, wherein R1 is selected from alkyl, R2 is selected from alkyl, aryl, alkoxy and R3 is selected from alkyl, cycloalkyl, arylalkyl, which comprises heating a mixture of alkyl 3-trichloromethyl-2-acyl/carbalkoxyacrylates of formula II, wherein R1 is alkyl, R2 is selected from alkyl, aryl or alkoxy groups, in presence<br>
of amines of formula III of the accompanying drawing of this specification, wherein R3 is<br><br>
selected from alkyl, cycloalkyl, arylalkyl inclaimed organic solvents at the temperature in<br>
range of 25 °C to the boiling point temperature of the appropriate solvents for a period of 1 to 10 hr., removing the solvent by distillation and purifying the product by conventional methods to obtain alkyl 2-acyl/carbalkoxy-3-(substituted amino)acrylates.<br><br>
In an embodiment the organic solvent is selected from acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, hydrocarbons such as hexane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene, chlorinated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, dichloroethane etc., preferably acetonitrile.<br>
