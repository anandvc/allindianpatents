The present invention relates to an adaptive focusing method for an optical disc and an apparatus thereof. The present invention relates to the field of controlling an optical disc drive, and more particularly, to an adaptive focusing method and apparatus to control an optical disc drive using an adaptive focus search algorithm.<br><br>
Description of the Related Art:<br><br>
An optical disc is a mass storage medium that can hold up to several tens gigabytes of binary data in an inexpensive plastic disc. Due to a large capacity of the optical disc, the optical disc is widely used as a major data storage medium in the computer field and multimedia devices.<br><br>
An optical disc drive includes a large number of component parts including motors, actuators and optical and electronic components. Many control algorithms are used to control motors and actuators to move a pickup head in a proper way so as to access a recording layer on a disc surface. One of problems of the control algorithms is to focus a laser beam onto the surface of the optical disc. More particularly, the control algorithms have a problem with detecting and adjusting an optimal focus point of the pickup head.<br><br>
In conventional optical pickup heads, a laser diode is used to generate the laser beam to be radiated onto a data area (i.e. the recording layer) of the optical disc. A photo sensor, which generates opto-electrical signals representing focusing/tracking errors in the optical pickup heads, detects the laser beam reflected from the surface of the optical disc. The photo<br>
sensor includes a number of separate light sensitive areas. Some of the iignt sensitive areas is used to generate a focusing error signal (FES). The FF5 is used in servo controi algorithms to detect and adjust the pickup head to correct a focusing position A control signal of a focus actuator is referred to as a focus drive signal (FOD,).<br><br>
FIG. 1 is a time diagram illustrating a process includir~g a general focusing algorithm used in the optical disc drive. At an initial stage, the pickup head moves from a central position<br>
0.0 (0-state) toward a lowermost position (1-state). When the pickup head reaches the owermost position (1-state), the pickup head goes to the uppermost position (2-state) to make a saw-tooth pulse movement. When the pickup head arrives at the uppermost position (2-state), the pickup head goes back to the lowermost position (1-state) and then repeats the process of going to the 2-state and back to the 1-state until the pickup head stably achieves focusing. This procedure is called a focus search. FODTOPMARGN' is a constant to define a maximum value of the FOD during a focus search and FODBOTMARGN' is a constant to define a minimum value of the FOD during the focus search. 'FODMAGNSTEP' and FODTIMESTEP' are constants to determine a velocity of the focus actuator, i.e., constants to define fixed distance intervals for a smallest change in the FOD and time intervals between closest changes in the FOD, respectively.<br><br>
When the pickup head approaches the focus point, the FES changes like S-curves shown in FIG. <br>
A center of the S-curves corresponds to the focus point of the pickup head and a number of S-curves is equal to a number of layers of an optical disc.<br><br>
However, a high-density optical disc uses an objective lens having a small numerical aperture (NA) and has a small gap between the surface and a recording layer of the high-density optical disc. Thus, a focal length of the objective lens decreases and an allowance of a vertical distortion of the high-density optical disc increases. As a result, when the general focusing algorithm presented in FIG. 1 is used, the objective lens is highly likely to scratch or damage the surface of the high-density optical disc. A searching time is long until the stable focusing is attained in an initial search for a focus point and after losing the focus due to dirt on and damage to the surface of the high-density optical disc.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRITPlON OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMEN~I'S<br><br>
Reference wHi now be made in detaiI to the aspects of the presert ivention, examples of which are Ilustratec ~n the accompanying drawings, wnere~ hke reference numerals refer to the Ike elernents throughout. The aspects are deschbed below to expiain the present nvention by referring to the figures.<br><br><br>
FiG. 3 is a schematic block di3gram of an optical disc drive to which ~n adaptive focusing method is applied, according to the present invention. Reference numeral 100 denotes a disc, reference numeral 110 denotes a pickup unit, which can also be referred to as a pickup head, including an optical system ricluding a laser diode, an objective lens, a photo sensor, and the like, and reference numeral 120 denotes a reflected signal detector whicfl detects a reflected signal from the photo sensor. Reference numeral 130 denotes a signal processor which generates a signal to drive the optical disc drive using an adaptive focus search aigortthm, including a static part and a dynamic part, that prevents spikes from a surface of the disc 100 and the objective lens and reduces a focus search time. Reference numeral 140 denotes a focus servo controfler including a focus actuator, which keeps a gap between the objective lens and a recording layer of the disc 100 in a focus-in state, and so forth. Reference numeral 150 denotes a disc driver including a spindie motor, which rotates the disc 100, and the like.<br><br>
The adaptive focus search algorithm, which can be reaiized as software in a controller (not shown) of the signal processor 130or in the signal processor 130, is divided into two parts. The first part is the static part used before starting focusing or in nitiaiization. In the static part, for iflustrative purposes, the spindle motor of the disc driver 150 is motionless and the focus actuator of the focus servo controller 140 has an adaptive swing margin. A swing margin of the focus actuator can be caicufated every pass of the pickup head depencing on an actual position of a center of S-curves or a focus point and may be an absolute swing margin to prevent damage to the opticai system in the absence of an FES feedback signaL The static part does not allow the rotation of the spindle motor and is proposed to check a Pipe of disc and a number of layers and to adjust an FES gain coefficient.<br><br>
 The second part is the dynamic part, wHch sriould be used only wnen the disc lOG rotates r~ synchronization with a velocity of the spindle motor of the disc driver 150 and when a focus is suddenly deviated due to outer disturbances, an unstable operation of the optical<br><br>
beam reflected from the surface and the recording layer of the disc 1 00. The photo sensor has a number of separate light sensitive areas and the reflected signal detector 120 detects a portion of the reflected laser beam as the FES or detects the sum signal (i.e., the RF signal) to use the FES signal or the sum signal in the adaptive focus search algorithm.<br><br><br>
The signal detector 130 analog-to-digitalconverts the reflected signal (FES) detected by the reflected signal reflector 1 20 to obtain an actual value of the FES and low-pass filters the actual value of the FES, so that the controller can check whether the disc 100 is loaded, a type of disc, a number of layers of the disc 100 and adjust an FES gain coefficient using the actual value of the FES. The controller digital-to-analogoonverts the FOD value calculated by variables and constants used in the adaptive focus search algorithm presented in FIG. 4 and, then, provides the FOD value to the focus servo controller 140.<br><br>
The prevention of the spikes between the disc 100 and the objective lens of the pickup unit 110 is achieved by checking a rising part period of the S-curves of the FES. In an existing focus search algorithm, a result thereof marked with dotted lines in FIG. 4, a rising region of an FOD depends on a constant FODTOPMARGN. In the adaptive focus search algorithm, according to an aspect of the present invention, the ascending region of the FOD rises up to a maximum allowable value FOUT_MAX of the FOD, which corresponds to a maximum focus search voltage. The maximum allowable value FOUT_MAX exists within the constant FODTOPMARGN. When the pickup head reaches the maximum allowable value FOUT_MAX of the FOD, the descending region of the FOD is formed. In the existing focus search algorithm, the descending region of the FOD depends on a constant FODBOTMARGN. In the adaptive focus search algorithm, according to an aspect of the present invention, the descending region of the FOD is formed to a minimum allowable value FOUT_MIN (which corresponds to a minimum focus search voltage). The minimum allowable value FOUT_MIN exists within a constant FODBOTMARGN. When the pickup head reaches the minimum allowable value FOUT_MIN of the FOD, the ascending region of the FOD is re-formed. A number of times the descending region (i.e., the 1-state) with the ascending region of the FOD and the ascending region (i.e., the 2-state) with the descending region of the FOD are repeated after the reflected signal is detected is determined in consideration of the stability of focusing.<br><br><br>
After the reflected signal is detected, a section Ta representing an amount of the movement of the pickup head, i.e., a section ranging from a rising part of an S-curve to the<br><br>
maximum allowable value FOUT_MAX (which corresponds to a focus point) or from the maximum allowable value FOUT_MAX to a falling pan of the S-curve, may be set to be a fixed value. The section Ta may be adaptively set in proportion to a time interval from the reflection of the signal from the surface of the disc 1 DO to the reflection of the signal from the recording layer of the disc 100 or may be adaptively set using a peak-to-peak time of the FES with the S-curves. The set section Ta contributes to the prevention of the pickup head's touching the surface of the disc 100 and a reduction in the time required to search for the focus point using an adaptive margin of the FOD.<br><br>
At the bottom of FIG. 4, a focus point access time according to the general focus search algorithm and the focus point access time, according to an aspect of the adaptive focus search algorithm of the present invention, are shown. A time interval TO necessary to obtain a first S-curve is the same in both the general focus search algonthm and the adaptive focus search algorithm. An access time between the first S-curve and a third S-curve is T2 in the general focus search algorithm, but Ti in the adaptive focus search algorithm, where Ti <t2. accordingly according to an aspect of the present invention actual swing margin a vertical deviation pickup head is adaptive during focus search operation prevent from touching surface disc due outer disturbances and time req uired for searching point reduced.></t2.><br><br>
FIGS. SA through 5D are time diagram5 of the adaptive focus Search algorithm according to another aspect of the present invention, i.e., a time diagram of a profile of the FES and the FOD when Performing the dynami0 part in which the disc 1oo and the Pickup head operate, a timing diagram of driving clock pulses of the spindle motor, and a timing diagram of the vertical deviation of the disc 100. The focus search algorithm will be described with reference to the Optical disc drive shown in FIG. 3.<br><br><br>
FIG. 5A shows a profile of the vertical deviation of the disc 100 during the rotation of the disc 100, and FIG 5B shows the driving clock pulses of the spindle motor generated by the disc driver 150, which rotates the disc 100 FIG. SC is the timing diagram of the FOD, and FIG. SD is the timing diagram of the FES.<br><br><br>
According to the dynamic part Of the adaptive focus search algorithm althoug focusing deviates during the operation of the disc 100 due to outer disturbances,<br>
the verticles<br><br>
deviation (FIG. 5A) of the disc 100 can be predicted. Thus, the FOD. wnich is referred to as a focus search voltage, is adjusted so that the disc 100 enters a closest focus position. Four states of the FOD. i.e., the 0-state, the 1-state, the 2-state, and a 3-state, will be described below.<br><br><br>
In the 0-state, a time delay is created to prevent false conditions caused by possible false S-curves of the FES due to the unpredictable relative positions of the pickup head and the surface of the disc 100. A current output ESOUT of the FOD is initialized and the maximum allowable value FOUT_MAX of the FOD is set to be an initial margin. V other words, an initial value of the maximum allowable value FOUT_MAX of the FOD is equal to a variable FOUT_MIN_GLOB and depends on a previous state of a focus servo system of the optical disc drive. When the previous state of the focus servo system is an on-focus state, the variable FOUT_MIN_GLOB has a minimum filtered FOD value, which corresponds to a lowermost position of the surface of the disc 100. When the previous state of the focus servo system is not the on-focus state, the variable FOUT_MIN_GLOB has a constant FODBOTMARGN to prevent the touching of the disc 100. In FIG. 50, FOUT_MIN_GLOB_C is a constant to define a fixed distance interval for an initial position of the FOD in a starting portion of the dynamic part of the adaptive focus search algorithm.<br><br><br>
The 1-state forms a slowly ascending region of the FOD with a rising velocity of at least predetermined times (e.g., 10 times) less than the rising velocity of the pickup head. A vertical rising velocity of the pickup head is set to be less than a vertical deviation velocity of the surface of the disc 100 shown in FIG. 5A.<br>
If the S-curve of the FOD is found, the voltage FSOUT of the FOD is stored and a time uSTIME to keep a latest moment an S-curve is found is stored. Further, a new top margin FOUT_MAX is calculated as a focus point A*FODTIMESTEP, and the 1-state is switched to the 2-state. When no S-curves are found, the 1-state is switched to the 0-state so as to start the dynamic part from an initial state.<br><br>
The 2-state forms the ascending region of the FOD. During the 2-state, the FES having the S-curves is checked. When the S-curve is found, the new top margin FOUT_MAX is calculated as the focus point A*FODMAGNSTEP, where A is a constant. In this calculation, the time and the distance of the movement of the pickup head are fixed in the 2-state.<br>
 The 3-state forms the descending and flat horizontal regions of the FOD. The descending region quickly moves the pickup head from a dangerous area to a safe position and the flat region keeps the pickup head in a stand-by state. A stand-by state duration is calculated by uSTIME (a last instant of time when an S-curve is found) + uREVTlME (revolution interval of the spindle motor) — (A+B)*FODTIMSTEP. Here, B is a constant to define a fixed distance interval to keep the pickup head below the lowermost position of the surface of the disc 100. After the 3-state, the 3-state is switched to the 2-state, and then the states are repeated in the order of the 2-state, the 3-state, the 2-state, the 3-state, etc. to search for the focus.<br><br>
 Accordingly, the dynamic part of the focus search algorithm uses information about a<br>
revolution time of the spindle motor, a current time, and a moment of a safe lower most position of<br>
the surface of the disc 100 to synchronize the moment of getting the S-curves and the lowermost position of the surface of the disc 100, which leads to a safe, unbreakable focus search algorithm. Also, the focus search time required to enter the safe focus state can be reducel<br><br>
As described above, according to an aspect, the present invention is suitable for a high-density optical disc in which a gap between a surface and the recording layer is narrow. Also, an objective lens of a pickup head can be prevented from scratching or damaging the surface of the high-density optical disc during a search for a focus point. A time required to search for the focus point can be reduced right before starting focusing or in an initial state. Moreover, after losing the focus point in a normal operation, the search for the focus point is possible within a short period of time. As a result, stability and reliability of an optical system may be improved.<br><br>
A focus search algorithm proposed in the present invention is suitable for a high-density optical disc and can be realized in a digital signal processor, a microprocessor, or the like without any additional hardware cost.<br><br>
