				<td>A MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICE RECORDING INFORMATION<br>
RELATED TO A COMMUNICATION EVENT<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a mobile communication device recording<br>
information related to a communication event, and generally to the capturing,<br>
processing, mapping, reporting and displaying of telecommunication call events<br>
that occur on either landline or wireless communication devices (i.e., POTS<br>
telephones, cellular telephones,3G-based wireless data/telephones, etc.), where<br>
the information content of the telecommunication call events can be presented<br>
locally on the device or remotely on a desktop or laptop computer using a<br>
computer application or web browser that can interface to an online networked<br>
server.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Telecommunication devices, specifically wireless telephones, are<br>
achieving widespread use today. Such telecommunication devices are<br>
commonly used to establish communication between other telecommunication<br>
devices. Recently telecommunication devices are becoming more than just<br>
communication devices, but also a computing platform for executing<br>
applications similar to the early days of the personal computer era, where<br>
devices had limited memory and processing resources. The difference is that<br>
these new telecommunication devices, while currently provide a limited<br>
computing platform, also enable wireless data access to the Internet and<br>
expose the telephone's telephony functionality. These new telecommunication<br>
devices are well known to people that are skilled in the art.<br>
Prior art systems, such as customer premises equipment (CPE) enable<br>
the storage capability of caller identification (Caller ID) information of<br><br>
incoming calls, assuming that said Caller ID information is not blocked. For<br>
example, Lucent Technologies produces a model ISDN 8520T CPE that keeps<br>
a log of unanswered incoming, answered incoming, and outgoing telephone<br>
calls. Each call has a time stamp associated with it so that unanswered calls<br>
can be distinguished from available calls that have Caller ID information.<br>
When the CPE is used with a switch, such as an ISDN PBX switch, the CPE<br>
will provide each caller's name if it is stored in the switch's database. As<br>
individuals that pay telephone bills know, all of this caller information is also<br>
preferably included in a customer's telephone bills for the purpose of billing<br>
information and is well known to people that are skilled in the art.<br>
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) prior art applications<br>
provide a solution to understand customer related pipelines, such as sales or<br>
support team's pipelines. For sales, it is important to keep track of a<br>
company's Contacts, Accounts, and Opportunities. Every Account has a<br>
Contact or group of Contacts that are associated with the Account. Every<br>
Opportunity has one or many Accounts that are associated with the<br>
Opportunity and indirectly have Contacts that are associated with the<br>
Opportunity through a common Account or Accounts. Contacts, Accounts,<br>
and Opportunities have activities, such as telephone calls, that are associated<br>
with one or more of the Account, Opportunity, or Contact categories (i.e., a<br>
telephone call can be associated with a Contact that also has associations with<br>
an Account and an Opportunity). Prior art CRM systems are well known to<br>
people skilled in the art.<br>
US 2003/0073447 A1 discloses a positioning information transmitting<br>
device for transmitting current site data to a peripheral device using wireless<br>
signals. The device comprises current site positioning means and wireless<br>
communication means. It fails to teach recording data associated with<br>
telecommunication event. This document refers to a peripheral device such as a<br>
digital camera. It does not suggest improving the device by combining it with a<br>
wireless communication device capable of facilitating communication events. It<br>
does not disclose storing data associated with the communication event wherein<br>
the data includes GPS data and timing/date data associated with the<br>
communication device. The system simply allows an user to acquire position<br>
data of a remote device and recording timing data associated with the capture of<br>
digital images.<br><br>
A problem with existing prior art CPE and switch systems is that they<br>
only provide a mechanism for capturing call logs at the switch that the<br>
telecommunication device interfaces with. This is not practical with wireless<br>
telecommunication devices, since acquiring access to a switch at a base station<br>
is not reasonable due to the large number of base stations necessary to create a<br>
cellular wireless network. Also, accessing the call logs directly from different<br>
wireless or landline carriers introduces interface and connection issues, since<br>
carriers use different standards that are not compatible with other carriers.<br>
Another problem with accessing the call logs directly from a wireless<br>
or landline carrier is that each telecommunication carrier, which may be<br><br>
grouped in a local area or across an entire continent, would have to provide<br>
access to, or expose, call log information for their entire user-base on their<br>
networks. This introduces a significant privacy problem, in addition to<br>
requiring significant bandwidth to transport all of the users' call logs, since not<br>
all users on said networks will subscribe to this advanced service that<br>
integrates and associates call logs with database records.<br>
Yet another problem is that call logging by the wireless or landline<br>
carrier only provides call logs specifically for billing purposes, and the<br>
advanced Telecommunication Call Events that the telecommunication device<br>
can provide are not provided. For example, this invention provides a<br>
Telecommunication Call Event to include the GPS position of the<br>
telecornmunication device at the time the device received, missed, or initiated<br>
a telephone call, or during the entire duration of the telephone call.<br>
An additional problem with existing call logging systems, such as the<br>
CPE, is that the centralized logging solution does not always have the<br>
capability of being disabled or turned off. Specifically, this is the case for<br>
carrier specific switches whose main function is to record calls for billing<br>
purposes. By handling the Telecommunication Call Event recording (i.e., call<br>
logging) functions on the telecommunication devices, the authorized user can<br>
have the ability to disable the call logging functionality simply and effectively.<br>
It is yet another problem with the prior art system when a user owns or<br>
makes calls from multiple telecommunication devices (i.e., a landline<br>
telephone, a wireless telephone, etc.), specifically when the<br>
telecommunication devices are operated on different carrier networks, since<br>
interfacing with each call logging switch amongst all of the carriers that the<br>
telecommunication device connects with is a very difficult and daunting task.<br>
This problem is further exaggerated if the user owns a wireless<br>
telecommunication device with roaming capability and "roams" into a<br>
different wireless carrier network. With prior art systems, access to all<br>
possible roaming networks would be required to provide a continuous call<br>
logging solution.<br>
Another problem with existing database applications, such as CRM<br>
applications, is that the user is required to manually enter the<br><br>
Telecommunication Call Event associations (i.e-, such as telephone number<br>
associations) into database records, such as Contact date (i.e., vCARD),<br>
Accounts, or the like. Providing a system that autonomously updates the call<br>
history information would provide better real-time forecasting and reporting<br>
information. As people that are skilled in the art will agree, this significantly<br>
improves the effectiveness of such systems.<br>
Until now, an adequate solution to these problems has eluded those<br>
skilled in the art Thus, there exists a need to provide a solution that enables<br>
Telecommunication Devices to capture Telecommunication Call Events for<br>
enabling the association of Telecommunication Call Events with database<br>
records, which may include without limitation Contacts, Accounts,<br>
Oportunities, Forecasts, Leads, Tasks, Documents, Cases, other Events, or<br>
the like. This invention provides many important benefits for<br>
Telecommunication Devices which are an important and integral part of<br>
improving Work Flow-related processes.<br><br>

It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system<br>
for enabling the capturing and logging of Telecommunication Call Events on<br>
the Telecommunication Device. As Telecommunication Call Events occur,<br>
they are registered and stored or recorded to a data storage device, located<br>
either locally within the Telecommunication Device or externally on a remote<br>
storage device connected to the Telecommunication Device through either a<br>
wired connection, such as the InternetAntranet/Extranet, wireless connection,<br>
infrared connection, optical connection, or any combination of the<br><br>
aforementioned or similar connections (i.e., wired, wireless, infrared, optical,<br>
or the like connection). In one embodiment, these local storage devices also<br>
include a flash memory storage device, hard disc drive, optical memory, non-<br>
volatile memory, or the like as well known to those skilled in the art. As<br>
illustrated, it is also an object of the present invention to enable the capability<br>
so that the storage of Telecommunication Call Events, which typically occur<br>
in real-time, can be stored on a remote networked storage device. In one<br>
embodiment, the Telecommunication Call Events are packaged and pushed<br>
directly to an online Internet-connected networked server that is connected to<br>
the Telecommunication Device using first a wireless connection through a<br>
wireless base station and then through the Internet to an online networked<br>
server.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system<br>
for enabling the synchronization or transfer of said Telecommunication Call<br>
Events, where the synchronization or transfer of said Telecommunication Call<br>
Events are initiated based on 1). Real-Time Telecommunication Call Events,<br>
2). Scheduled Ad-Hoc and/or Reoccurring Time Intervals, and/or 3). Locally<br>
or Remotely Initiated Triggered Events. The Telecommunication Call Events<br>
are synchronized or transferred from the Telecommunication Device to 1). a<br>
Centralized Server Computing System (i.e., peer-to-server connection), 2). a<br>
Distributed Server Computing System (i.e., peer-to-multiple servers), and/or<br>
3). a Personal Computing System using a variety of different transport<br>
mediums, such as a wired, wireless, infrared, optical, or the like connection.<br>
For example in one embodiment, the Telecommunication Device can<br>
synchronize or transfer its Telecommunication Call Events using a peer-to-<br>
peer (P2P) configuration directly to another computing platform, such as a<br>
local PDA using a wireless Bluetooth connection. In another embodiment, the<br>
Telecommunication Device can synchronize or transfer its<br>
Telecommunication Call Events using a peer-to-server (P2S) configuration to<br>
an online centralized server for later retrieval of said call events and/or work<br>
flow status information. In a similar embodiment, the online server embodies a<br>
distributed server system for the purpose of enabling better Reliability,<br>
Availability, and Scalability (RAS) of the synchronization, transfer, or<br><br>
retrieval of said Telecommunication Call Events and/or work flow status<br>
information.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system<br>
for enabling the synchronization or transfer of said Telecommunication Call<br>
Events in Real-Time from the local Telecommunication Device.<br>
With advanced wireless telecommunication devices (such as devices<br>
that provide simultaneous data and voice capability, etc.) or<br>
telecommunication devices with out-of-band data functionality (such as SMS<br>
functionality or the like), the transfer of Telecommunication Call Events can<br>
occur in Real-Time to 1). a centralized server computing system, 2). a<br>
distributed server computing system, and/or 3). a personal computing system.<br>
This particular object allows the storing of the Telecommunication Call Events<br>
to the local telecommunication data storage device for the purpose of ensuring<br>
the delivery of the Telecommunication Call Events. In most scenarios,<br>
temporarily storing the Telecommunication Call Events is the preferred<br>
method of operation in order to provide a reliable data transfer, which is<br>
typically necessary in a wireless environment. Whenever a<br>
Telecommunication Call Event occurs, the event is transferred, synchronized,<br>
or "pushed" in real-time to the accompanying receiving device(s). After the<br>
real-time transfer of die Telecommunication Call Events has occurred, a copy<br>
of the Telecommunication Call Event(s) may be temporarily stored locally for<br>
added reliability until an acknowledgement of the receipt of the specific<br>
Telecommunication Call Event(s) is received by the Telecommunication<br>
Device. Once the Telecommunication Device has received an<br>
acknowledgement or confirmation from the receiving device(s), the<br>
Telecommunication Device can then safely delete or remove the sent<br>
Telecommunication Call Event(s). If the Telecommunication Device did not<br>
receive an acknowledgment from the receiving device(s), the<br>
Telecommunication Device will first store, then forward or resend the data at a<br>
later time. This store-and-forward operation will continue until the<br>
Telecommunication Device receives an acknowledgement from the receiving<br>
device(s) corifirming the delivery of the Telecommunication Call Event(s) for<br>
the specific Telecommunication Device. This method provides a mechanism<br><br>
for ensuring that the transferred Telecommunication Call Events will reach<br>
their desired destination in a wireless environment that periodically has no<br>
coverage area or is subject to coverage loss due to a number of various<br>
reasons, such as multipath, blockage, etc. In one embodiment, when a call is<br>
received, that call's telephone call event and Caller ID information (e.g.,<br>
telephone number of caller, telephone number of called telephone, time the<br>
call was started, voice call event, received call event, non-roaming call event,<br>
etc.) is transferred, synchronized, or "pushed" in real-time to an online server.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system<br>
for enabling the Telecommunication Call Events synchronization or transfer<br>
process to be scheduled to occur at various reoccurring times or ad-hoc.<br>
Typically, for the Scheduled Event Model, the Telecommunication Call<br>
Events are recorded to the Telecommunication Device's data storage device in<br>
real-time as they occur, such as in a Flash Memory storage device, hard disc<br>
drive, or the like as well known to those skilled in the art. At a predetermined<br>
or scheduled time, the accumulated Telecommunication Call Events are<br>
synchronized or transferred to 1). a centralized server computing system (i.e.,<br>
peer-to-server connection), 2). a distributed server computing system (i.e.,<br>
peer-to-multiple servers), and/or 3). a personal computing system. In one<br>
embodiment, at the top of every hour the accumulated Telecommunication<br>
Call Events are synchronized or transferred to an online server.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system<br>
for enabling the Telecommunication Call Events synchronization or transfer<br>
process to be triggered based on the detection of a local and/or remote event.<br>
In this present invention, locally triggered events may include<br>
Telecommunication Call Events, pressing a key on the Telecommunication<br>
Device, power-on event, low battery event, reaching a specified storage size<br>
limit or storage threshold for the Telecommunication Device, signing-in or<br>
executing an application or sub-process running on the Telecommunication<br>
Device, or the like. Externally triggered events may include receiving an E-<br>
Mail, SMS message, or TCP/IP or UDP command packet to remotely initiate<br>
the synchronization or transfer process. This command packet (for example, a<br>
SMS message) may also utilize authentication and authorization protocols and<br><br>
procedures in order to correctly identity and authenticate that the user or<br>
process which remotely initiated the synchronization or transfer process has<br>
the proper authority and credentials to initiate such a request.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system<br>
for notifying and providing a confirmation message to the Telecommunication<br>
Device that recently had a remotely-initiated synchronization or transfer<br>
process performed. This object of the present invention apprises the owner(s)<br>
or user(s) of the Telecommunication Device that a remote synchronization or<br>
transfer process had recently been completed by an authorized user that had<br>
the appropriate credentials to make such a request The confirmation message<br>
may be digitally signed to authenticate that the sender of the confirmation<br>
message is an authorized remote system or user that initiated the<br>
synchronization request. This present invention allows the confirmation<br>
message to be sent directly to the Telecommunication Device's unique<br>
address, such as an SMS address (i.e., telephone number of the<br>
Telecommunication Device, such as <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b48d808d81818185868586f4c3ddc6d1d8d1c7c7d7d5c6c6ddd1c69ad7dbd9">[email&#160;protected]</a>), in<br>
addition to numerous other unique addresses that are associated with the<br>
Telecommunication Device. These additional addresses may include the<br>
owner's or user's E-Mail address for the Telecommunication Device, or the IT<br>
administrator's E-Mail address that maintains the Telecommunication Device,<br>
or any predefined unique address (i.e., E-Mail Address, Pager Number,<br>
Telephone Voice Mail Address, or the like) that was set by a user that has<br>
proper authority and credentials for the Telecommunication Device.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide the synchronization<br>
or transfer process of Telecommunication Call Events or data related to<br>
Telecommunication Call Events using a wired, wireless, infrared, optical, or<br>
similar connection. For example, in one embodiment, a Telecommunication<br>
Call Events log can be transferred to an online networked server via both a<br>
wireless connection, such as when using a cell phone to a base station, and<br>
then through the Internet to an online networked server. In another<br>
embodiment, the connection to the Internet can also be enabled first through a<br>
serial, USB, Firewire, or the like connection that is connected to a desktop or<br>
laptop computer, and then through the Internet connection which is established<br><br>
from the desktop or laptop computer. In a similar embodiment, the connection<br>
can also be established wirelessly to either the desktop or laptop computer,<br>
such as using a Bluetooth connection. In a different embodiment, the wireless<br>
connection can be established using a Local Area Network (LAN), such as in<br>
an office environment. In a similar embodiment, the wireless connection can<br>
be established using a Wide Area Network (WAN), as with a cellular device<br>
that is wirelessly connected to a nearby base station which has an established<br>
connection to the online networked server by means of an Internet connection.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system<br>
to provide the association of either Contacts) to Telecommunication Call<br>
Events and/or Telecommunication Call Events to Contacts), in which the<br>
Contacts) are stored and referenced from a database, either locally or through<br>
an online centralized or distributed server. The Contact fields are searchable<br>
and capable of being correlated with the Telecommunication Call Events. For<br>
example, in one embodiment, a Telecommunication Device received a call<br>
from telephone number (732) 792-4265 on June 17, 2001 at 4:30 PM EST. In<br>
this embodiment, the Telecommunication Device received said telephone call<br>
and synchronized the Telecommunication Call Events information (such as,<br>
but not limited to, the telephone number of caller, telephone number called,<br>
time stamp when call was started, call duration, time stamp when call was<br>
ended, voice call, received call event, non-roaming call, etc.) to an online<br>
networked server. In this embodiment, a user is able to view using a web<br>
browser which Contact in their database initiated the call. The server provided<br>
this functionality by correlating the received Telecommunication Call Events<br>
which contained the caller's telephone number with the telephone number that<br>
was stored in the user's Contact database. This same object provides the<br>
capability for viewing said correlated contacts for said Telecommunication<br>
Call Events either locally on the Telecommunication Device or remotely, such<br>
as from another computing device or other Telecommumcation Device.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system<br>
to enable users within a predefined group to share their individual Contact<br>
databases with each other for the purpose of providing a more complete and<br>
combined set of Contact Information (i.e., vCard, which automates the<br><br>
exchange of information typically found on a traditional business card) for the<br>
purpose of correlating said Contact Information with Telecommunication Call<br>
Events. Each Contact entry (i.e., vCard) has various user-defined permissions<br>
associated with it that defines how the Contact entry can be used by the system<br>
and users within a group. It is another object of the present invention to allow<br>
group administrators, or similarly authorized users, to assign permission<br>
control to users within the group. This permission control allows specified<br>
users to perform search queries, and view or edit other users' Contact<br>
Information within their organization. Every vCard contained within the group<br>
has a pre-defined owner of the Contact data where the owner of said Contact<br>
data is provided with inherent default access permissions unless otherwise<br>
designated by the administrator of the group or user. The permissions model<br>
includes, but is not limited to, the following permission attributes for each<br>
Contact entry: Full Control, Read-Only, Search Enabled/Disabled, and<br>
Modify.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system<br>
to search all of the fields contained in the Contact Information (i.e., vCard) for<br>
the purpose of correlating and matching with Telecommunication Call Events<br>
either locally in the Telecommunication Device or remotely on the server or<br>
other computing device.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system<br>
to provide the association of Telecommunication Call Events with any public<br>
or private database record, specifically with the association of either White<br>
Pages or Yellow Pages (i.e., Points of Interest (POI)) information with<br>
Telecommunication Call Events and vise-versa. It should be noted that White<br>
Pages and Yellow Pages information is very similar to vCard information with<br>
minor field variations and a different data compilation process. The White or<br>
Yellow Pages data fields are searchable and capable of being correlated with<br>
Telecommunication Call Events. In one embodiment, a Telecommunication<br>
Device received a call from telephone number (732) 792-4265 on June 17,<br>
2001 at 4:30 PM EST. In this embodiment, the Telecommunication Device<br>
received said telephone call and synchronized the Telecommunication Call<br>
Events information (such as, but not limited to, the telephone number of caller,<br><br>
telephone number of called, time stamp when call was started, call duration,<br>
time stamp when call was ended, voice call, received call event, non-roaming<br>
call, etc.) to an online networked server. Using a web browser, a user is able to<br>
view information about the White Pages (i.e., consumers and businesses) or<br>
Yellow Pages (i.e., business) listing that initiated the call using the server's<br>
capability to correlate the received Caller-ID provided telephone number with<br>
the telephone number stored in the White or Yellow Pages database listing.<br>
This same object provides the capability for viewing said correlated White or<br>
Yellow Pages database listing for said Telecommunication Call Events either<br>
locally on the Telecommunication Device or remotely, such as from another<br>
computing device or other Telecommunication Device.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system<br>
to search all of the fields contained in any database record or field for the<br>
purpose of correlating and matching with Telecommunication Call Events<br>
either locally in the Telecommunication Device or remotely on the server or<br>
other computing device.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system<br>
to log and process Telecommunication Call Events, such as a telephone<br>
number that the Telecommunication Device is able to establish a connection<br>
with while utilizing connections that are based on various types of connections<br>
and protocols, such as PSTN, CDMA, GSM, GPRS, iDEN, TCP/IP, UDP, or<br>
the like. This includes, but is not limited to: International Access Numbers,<br>
International Direct Dialing (IDD) prefix including the Destination Country<br>
Code and Phone Number, Standard Phone Numbers, International Phone<br>
Numbers, Information Call (411), Operated Assisted Call (611), Distress Call<br>
(911), *69, *86, 11-digit phone numbers in the US, *66, or the like.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system<br>
for the association of Telecommunication Call Events with Contacts that have<br>
other threads or associations with additional records. This object allows for the<br>
indirect correlation of Telecommunication Call Events with these indirectly<br>
linked records, which include, but are not limited to: Accounts, Opportunities,<br>
Forecasts, Leads, Tasks, Documents, Cases, other Events, or the like. In one<br>
embodiment, in a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application, a<br><br>
Contact is associated or linked to an Account. An Account (i.e., such as a<br>
Business Customer) may have a plurality of Contacts that are associated or<br>
linked with it (i.e., such as a business account having multiple points of<br>
contact or representatives). When viewing either the Contact or Account<br>
information, it is possible with this invention to view at a glance the "Activity<br>
History" for either the Contact or Account. The Activity History can display<br>
Telecommunication Call Events that are correlated with said Contact or<br>
Account, thus providing a detailed snap-shot of the recent interactions with the<br>
Contact or Account. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the<br>
users of the group do not have to manually update their calls with Contacts of<br>
various Accounts or directly with the Accounts as with prior art systems, since<br>
this invention provides an automated method and system for updating said<br>
Activity History automatically.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system<br>
that enables notifications that are triggered by Telecommunication Call Events<br>
which are associated or linked to either a single or plurality of database<br>
records for the purpose of updating said database records by means of said<br>
notification. The notifications relate information or content to said<br>
Telecommunications Call Events. The notification can be delivered to the<br>
local Telecommunication Device and/or a remote computing device. These<br>
notifications can be displayed 1). in real-time while a telephone call is in<br>
progress, 2). immediately after a telephone call, 3). upon the execution of an<br>
application, process, or by opening an application window or clicking on an<br>
application link (i.e., such as a URL in a web browser), 4). at a predefined<br>
scheduled time period, either once or at reoccurring intervals, 5). at a specific<br>
geographic location or within a geographic range or area, 6). upon receiving<br>
an e-mail, SMS message, or instant message, 7). upon receiving a page, and/or<br>
8). based on a user's current presence or status or a change in presence or<br>
status, such as Available, Busy, On the Phone, etc., or the like. In this same<br>
object of this invention, the invention provides notifications that contain<br>
associations, references, or links to database records that are somehow<br>
correlated to the recent Telecommunication Call Events, such as by a<br>
telephone number, on the Telecommunication Device that is registered with<br><br>
the user. In one embodiment, a user receives a telephone call on the wireless<br>
Telecommunication Device from a Contact at a major Account called "Acme<br>
Manufacturing". After the call has concluded, the system provides a<br>
notification display on the user's Telecommunication Device with a link to: 1).<br>
the Contact Information (i.e., vCard) for the Contact at "Acme<br>
Manufacturing" that called, 2). the "Acme Manufacturing" Account<br>
information, and 3). the opportunity information for the "Acme<br>
Manufacturing" Account. By means of the providing these three links (i.e.,<br>
one for the Contact, one for the Account, and one for the Opportunity), the<br>
user of the Telecommunication Device is able to update the information that<br>
had changed due to the telephone call conversation that was privy between<br>
both calling parties. The user is then able to update either the caller's Contact<br>
information (i.e., the preferred Contact fields are illustrated in the preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention), such as a new telephone number, mail address,<br>
contact description, or the like. The user is also able to update the Account<br>
related information, during or after the telecommunication call, that was<br>
associated or had some degree of correlation to the previous<br>
Telecommunication Call Events, such as including, but not limited to the<br>
following:<br>
•	Account Name<br>
•	Phone Number<br>
•	Parent Account Information<br>
•	Website<br>
•	Account Number<br>
•	Ticker Symbol<br>
•	Type (i.e., such as private, public, etc.)<br>
•	Industry: (i.e., Telecommunications, Media, Manufacturing, etc.)<br>
•	Number of Employees<br>
•	Annual Revenue<br>
•	SIC Code<br>
•	Billing Addresses<br>
•	Voice Notes or Memos<br><br>
•	Text Notes or Memos<br>
•	Images<br>
•	Customizable Forms (i.e., Account Information, Opportunity<br>
Information, Contact Information such as vCard Information, Field<br>
Specific Forms, or the like, that is related to the<br>
Telecommunication Call Event)<br>
The user is also capable of updating the Opportunity Information that<br>
was associated or had some degree of correlation to the previous<br>
Telecommunication Call Events, such as including, but not limited to the<br>
following:<br>
•	Opportunity Information:<br>
o Primary Information<br>
■	Opportunity Owner (i.e., Contact Owner)<br>
■	Opportunity Name<br>
■	Account Name (i.e., the Account that is linked to<br>
this Opportunity)<br>
■	Type: (i.e., new, existing, etc.)<br>
■	Lead Source<br>
o	Deal Amount (i.e., the size of the deal)<br>
o	Status (i.e., Open, Pending, Closed and Close Date)<br>
o	Next Steps (i.e., Need estimate Update., etc.)<br>
o	Stage (i.e., Needs Analysis, Proposal/Price Quote, Closed<br>
Lost, Negotiation/Review, etc.)<br>
o	Probability (%): (i.e., 80%, 90%, etc.)<br>
o	Description<br>
In a similar embodiment of this invention, the user received the<br>
notification while the call was in progress on their laptop computer and was<br>
able to update the information during the course of the conversation.<br>
An additional part of this object provides for a user that calls or<br>
receives calls from a corresponding Telecommunication Device to receive a<br>
notification event based on recent Telecommunication Events that were<br><br>
correlated with database records. These notification events include pending<br>
alerts or To-Do tasks apprising the user of the Telecommunication Device that<br>
un-correlated information needs to be updated, based on recent<br>
Telecommunication Events that the system is not able to update and correlate<br>
autonomously. In one embodiment, a user receiving or making a telephone<br>
call to a single or group of users receives a notification event that includes a<br>
pending To-Do task after that call has been tenninated, determined by<br>
Telecommunication Call Events.<br>
The pending To-Do task requires the user to update the notes<br>
information for that contact in order to describe the call, through the means of<br>
entering information into text entry forms that are specific to the user's<br>
business, or by updating the deal flow of the account information for the<br>
particular account that is associated with the telephone number (i.e.,<br>
Telecommunication Call Event). In another embodiment, while the telephone<br>
call is in progress a user receives a reminder to update text entry forms about<br>
the contact they are having a conversation with, such as updating the sales<br>
projections for the current account that is associated with the user. In another<br>
embodiment, after a phone call has concluded, the authorized user of the<br>
Telecommunication Device will be apprised, by the Telecoimnunication<br>
Device's program that is running on said device, that a user should create<br>
voice-recorded notes in reference to the phone call. In a similar embodiment,<br>
after a phone call has concluded, the Telecommunication Device's application<br>
that is running on said device will notify the user if they wish to copy and save<br>
for later access a part of, or the entire, recorded voice phone call and associate<br>
it with the contact corresponding to the called or received phone number. The<br>
recorded phone call can reside locally on the Telecommunication Device and<br>
can also be synchronized or transferred to the online server system for access<br>
via a web browser or custom application program running on a computing<br>
device which is associated with various database records, such as vCard,<br>
Account Information, Opportunity Information, or the like-<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system<br>
that enables database records that have none or old time-stamped references to<br>
Telecommunication Call Events for the purpose of triggering notifications<br><br>
based on a predefined temporal threshold for the aging of each database<br>
record. This notification event can also be based on the frequency of<br>
Telecommunication Call Events that relate to a database record. For example,<br>
in one embodiment an Account was established with a company that<br>
represents a large Opportunity for the business to sell their product to.<br>
The account has a group of associated Contacts that are the key<br>
decision makers of the Account. Since time may be critical to closing this sale<br>
for this Account, this invention allows an aging trigger event to be defined and<br>
triggered if a user within the organization does not call the telephone numbers<br>
of any Contacts who are associated with the Account within the predefined<br>
time limit set by the administrator of the organization. In this embodiment, this<br>
can be used for capturing the Telecommunication Call Events for a particular<br>
user and can be applied to users in the organization or department, or to a<br>
single user that owns or uses a Telecommunication Device upon which the<br>
application is executed. In another embodiment, a user of an organization is<br>
required to call an Account at least once a week. If the user does not perform<br>
the task of calling the Account's Contact (i.e., from their vCard data) a<br>
notification will be sent to the administrator, or to the user that initiated the<br>
event, illustrating that the frequency of calls to this Account for the particular<br>
user fell below the set threshold of calls to this Account for past predefined<br>
period of time.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system<br>
that enables only one unique user account to be associated with one or many<br>
unique Telecommunication Devices. This invention allows multiple users to<br>
be associated with a single Telecommunication Device. However the preferred<br>
method of this invention is to allow only one user account to be assigned to<br>
multiple unique Telecommunication Devices (i.e., since users typically have<br>
more than one Telecommunication Device). This object of this invention also<br>
enables the prevention of a Telecommunication Device from being registered<br>
by multiple user accounts. This guarantees that Telecommunication Call<br>
Events that occur can be correlated with one and only one user account at a<br>
time, In one embodiment, when a user executes an application on the<br>
Telecommunication Device, the application will send a unique identifier, such<br><br>
as an ESN number, telephone number, or the like, to an online serer that will<br>
register the Telecommunication Device with the registered user that<br>
authenticated themselves and executed the application.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system<br>
that displays an outgoing call history log of recent Telecommunications Call<br>
Events on a Telecommunication Device or other computing device, such as a<br>
desktop or laptop personal computer. This invention provides no limit on the<br>
number of outgoing calls that can be displayed. This object of this invention<br>
enables the display of outgoing call history, including additional information<br>
and/or references or links that are associated with the outgoing call history log<br>
item(s) of recent Telecommunication Call Events for a particular or group of<br>
Telecommunication Device(s). These references or links connect<br>
Telecommunication Call Events with database records through the use of<br>
common keys present in both the Telecommunication Call Events and the<br>
database records. This invention allows partial or exact matches of common<br>
keys. Common keys include Telecommunication Call Events, or the like. For<br>
every outgoing call history item, typically denoted as a Telephone Number,<br>
other information can be displayed through this invention, such as, but not<br>
limited to the following Contact informational fields mat are correlated with<br>
the Telephone Number: Title, First Name, Middle Name, Last Name, Suffix,<br>
Company, Department, Job Title, Street Address, Street Address 2, Street<br>
Address 3, City, State, Postal Code, Country, Address" Latitude, Address'<br>
Longitude, Address' Altitude, etc. A plurality of unique Contact records can<br>
be displayed in this invention.<br>
In addition to displaying the most prominent Contact Information,<br>
links (i.e., known as shortcuts) are provided for allowing users to update<br>
various additional database records that have an association with the<br>
Telecommunication Call Event. These additional links or shortcuts include,<br>
but are not limited to the following database records: Accounts, Opportunities,<br>
Forecasts, Leads, Tasks, Documents, Cases, other Events, or the like. It is an<br>
object of this invention to allow the updating or populating of the outgoing<br>
call history log information by1). real-time updates as Telecommunication<br>
Call Events are processed, 2). scheduled ad-hoc and/or reoccurring time<br><br>
intervals, and/or 3). running an application or process such as a button or link<br>
(i.e., URL) that initiates a call history log update from an online server or local<br>
computing platform. In this same object of this invention, it is possible to read<br>
database records, such as the Opportunities record database, which has a<br>
common association using the Telecommunication Call Events as the common<br>
key. Using this link or shortcut, the user is able to quickly and effectively<br>
review and update database records that are related to recent<br>
Telecommunication Device activities without having to first search for said<br>
database record information. The retrieval of additional database records can<br>
either be cached locally or accessed upon demand. This object of the invention<br>
also provides for mapping any database record mat has geographical<br>
information associated with it through the call history.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system<br>
that enables the Telecommunication Device or other computing device, such<br>
as a desktop or laptop personal computer, to display an incoming call history<br>
log of recent Telecommunications Call Events. This invention provides no<br>
limit on the number of incoming calls that can be displayed. This object of this<br>
invention enables the display of incoming call history including additional<br>
information and/or references or links that are associated with the incoming<br>
call history log item(s) of recent Telecommunication Call Events for a<br>
particular or group of Telecommunication Device(s). These references or links<br>
connect Telecommunication Call Events with database records through the use<br>
of common keys present in both the Telecommunication Call Events and the<br>
database records. This invention allows partial or exact matches of common<br>
keys. Common keys include Telecommunication Call Events, or the like. For<br>
every incoming call history item, typically denoted as a Telephone Number,<br>
other information that can be displayed through this invention includes, but is<br>
not limited the following Contact information fields that are correlated with<br>
the Telephone Number: Title, First Name, Middle Name, Last Name, Suffix,<br>
Company, Department, Job Title, Street Address, Street Address 2, Street<br>
Address 3, City, State, Postal Code, Country, Address' Latitude, Address'<br>
Longitude, Address' Altitude, etc. A plurality of unique Contact records can<br>
be displayed in this invention.<br><br>
In addition to displaying the most prominent Contact Information,<br>
links (i.e., known as shortcuts) are provided for allowing users to update<br>
various additional database records that have an association with the<br>
Telecommunication Call Event. These additional links or shortcuts include,<br>
but are not limited to the following database records: Accounts, Opportunities,<br>
Forecasts, Leads, Tasks, Documents, Cases, other Events, or the like. It is an<br>
object of this invention to allow the updating or populating of the incoming<br>
call history log information by 1). real-time updates as Telecommunication<br>
Call Events are processed, 2). scheduled ad-hoc and/or reoccurring time<br>
intervals, and/or 3). running an application or process such as a button or link<br>
(i.e., URL) that initiates a call history log update from an online server or local<br>
computing platform. In this same object of this invention, it is possible to read<br>
database records, such as the Opportunities record database, which has a<br>
common association using the Telecommunication Call Events as the common<br>
key. Using this link or shortcut, the user is able to quickly and effectively<br>
update database records that are related to recent Telecommunication Device<br>
activities without having to first search for said database record information.<br>
The retrieval of additional database records can either be cached locally or<br>
accessed upon demand. This object of the invention also provides for mapping<br>
any database record that has geographical information associated with it<br>
through the call history.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system<br>
that enables the Telecommunication Device or other computing device, such<br>
as a desktop or laptop personal computer, to display a missed call history log<br>
of recent Telecommunications Call Events. This invention provides no limit<br>
on the number of missed calls that can be displayed. This object of this<br>
invention enables the display of missed call history including additional<br>
information and/or references or links that are associated with the missed call<br>
history log item(s) of recent Telecommunication Call Events for a particular or<br>
group of Telecommunication Device(s). These references or links connect<br>
Telecommunication Call Events with database records through the use of<br>
common keys present in both the Telecommunication Call Events and the<br>
database records. This invention allows partial or exact matches of common<br><br>
keys. Common keys include Telecommunication Call Events, or the like. For<br>
every missed call history item, typically denoted as a Telephone Number,<br>
other information can be displayed through this invention, including, but not<br>
limited to the following Contact information fields that are correlated with the<br>
Telephone Number: Title, First Name, Middle Name, Last Name, Suffix,<br>
Company, Department, Job Title, Street Address, Street Address 2, Street<br>
Address 3, City, State, Postal Code, Country, Address' Latitude, Address'<br>
Longitude, Address' Altitude, etc. A plurality of unique Contact records can<br>
be displayed in this invention. In addition to displaying the most prominent<br>
Contact Information, links (i.e., known as shortcuts) are provided for allowing<br>
users to update various additional database records that have an association<br>
with the Telecommunication Call Event.<br>
These additional links or shortcuts include, but are not limited to fee<br>
following database records: Accounts, Opportunities, Forecasts, Leads, Tasks,<br>
Documents, Cases, other Events, or the like. It is an object of this invention to<br>
allow the updating or populating of the missed call history log information by<br>
1). real-time updates as Telecommunication Call Events are processed, 2).<br>
scheduled ad-hoc and/or reoccurring time intervals, and/or 3). running an<br>
application or process such as a button or link (i.e., URL) that initiates a call<br>
history log update from an online server or local computing platform. In this<br>
same object of this invention, it is possible to read database records, such as<br>
the Opportunities record database, which has a common association using the<br>
Telecommunication Call Events as the common key. Using this link or<br>
shortcut, the user is able to quickly and effectively update database records<br>
that are related to recent Telecommunication Device activities without having<br>
to first search for said database record information. The retrieval of additional<br>
database records can either be cached locally or accessed upon demand. This<br>
object of the invention also provides for mapping any database record that has<br>
geographical information associated with it through the call history.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system<br>
that enables the Telecommunication Device to update the local address book<br>
based on a statistical analysis of the Telecommunication Call Events<br>
associated with a user (i.e., since the user can own multiple<br><br>
Telecommunication Devices) or with the Telecommunication Device. The<br>
Telecommunication Device's address book is an array of Contacts that can be<br>
stored locally on the Telecommunication Device for the purpose of accessing<br>
the vCard contents in real-time without a high-degree of access latency as<br>
typically observed when requesting data through a wireless network. This<br>
object of this present invention provides the means for calculating which<br>
Contacts are associated with a Telecommunication Device's<br>
Telecommunication Call Events and the frequency and age of updates for the<br>
purpose of ordering the user's Contact (i.e., vCard) information from the most<br>
active to the least active for a given user. This ordering is calculated in real-<br>
time as Telecommunication Call Events are recorded. Since most<br>
Telecommunication Devices have a finite number of Contact (i.e., vCard)<br>
allocations that can be stored locally in the Telecommunication Device, a<br>
maximum number of address book Contacts has to be established and may<br>
vary across different Telecommunication Devices. Since the user of the<br>
Telecommunication Device can have a larger base of Contacts than the<br>
Telecommunication Device can support, this maximum number will<br>
artificially limit how many Contacts can be synchronized or transferred to the<br>
Telecommunication Device.<br>
The synchronization or transfer process for updating the<br>
Telecommunication Device's address book can be implemented 1). in real-<br>
time as Telecommunication Call Events are processed, 2). at scheduled ad-hoc<br>
and/or reoccurring time intervals, 3). upon running an application or process<br>
such as a button or link (i.e., URL) that initiates an address book update,<br>
and/or 4). based on a percentage difference threshold in which the current<br>
address book listing differs from the new address book listing, or the like.<br>
Thus this object of this invention uses Telecommunication Call Events to<br>
calculate and then populate which Contacts are stored in the local address<br>
book of the Telecommunication Device. This object of this invention also<br>
provides a provision to for certain high-priority Contacts, such as emergency<br>
Contacts, to override other lower-priority Contacts, in the event that these<br>
Contacts normally would not be stored in the address book due to storage size<br><br>
limitations, but are required to be store locally on the Telecommunication<br>
Device.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system<br>
that enables the correlation or matching and/or extrapolation (i.e., partial<br>
matching) of Telecommunication Call Events with either local and/or remote<br>
database records. Since Telecommunication Call Events vary across different<br>
Telecommunication Devices, Telephone (i.e., landline) and Wireless Carriers,<br>
Telecommunication Standards (i.e., CDMA, GSM, iDEN, etc.), or the like, it<br>
is paramount to provide a means to correlate either exact or partial matches<br>
between Telecommunication Call Events and database records. This object of<br>
this invention provides the means to allow partial match correlations between<br>
Telecommunication Call Events and database records, such as Contact,<br>
Account, or the like. The following points provide additional dependent<br>
objects that increase the accuracy of the matching of exact and/or partial<br>
match correlations with said database records:<br>
1.	Extrapolate NPA (i.e., area code) Information for Telecommunication<br>
Events (i.e., Caller-ID) when said Telecommunication Events do not<br>
provide NPA information for local calls. Thus, it is an object of the<br>
invention to add NPA information to Telecommunication Events that<br>
do not include said NPA information, where the NPA information is<br>
derived from the local telephone number of the Telecommunication<br>
Device.<br>
2.	Allow partial matches for Telecommunication Devices contained<br>
within a Private Branch Exchange (PBX) system. For example, ANI<br>
(Automatic Number Identification or Caller-ID) provides the Direct<br>
Inward Dialing (DID) trunk from the PBX on which the call originated<br>
and not the actual PBX extension of the Telecommunication Device.<br>
Thus, it is an object of this invention to allow the partial match<br>
searches for telephone numbers that have a high degree of correlation<br>
to a particular or set of database records (i.e., Contact, Account, etc.).<br>
These partial correlations can be presented to the user in a different<br>
manner than exact match correlations.<br><br>
3. Provide a mechanism that allows the user to confirm and/or correct<br>
partial match correlations and enabling the user to select the correct<br>
database record or records to associate with the exact or partial<br>
Telecommunication Call Event (e.g., a user can select from a list the<br>
Contact, Account, or the like, that is associated with the telephone<br>
number, etc.).<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system<br>
that enables the user to match or choose which Telecommunication Call<br>
Events are to be associated with various database records. This can occur on<br>
the Telecommunication Device after a Telecommunication Call Event has<br>
ended (e.g., the end of a phone call), during a Telecommunication Call Event<br>
(e.g., during a phone call), or when a user authenticates and is authorized to<br>
sign in to a remote application, such as a custom application or web browser,<br>
for the purpose of updating PIM (Personal Information Management), or the<br>
like, information. For example, in one embodiment, a user can receive a<br>
number of phone calls from users that do not have any Caller-ID information<br>
and thus no phone number is provided. When the user signs in to their<br>
organization using a standard web browser, a list of uncorrected<br>
Telecommunication Call Events will be listed so that the user can manually<br>
associate the uncorrelated Telecommunication Call Events with current<br>
database records, such as vCard contacts, or so that the user can create a new<br>
database record, such as a user vCard or business Account, for the purpose of<br>
associating the Telecommunication Call Event with a database record for<br>
reports, notifications, or like.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system<br>
that provides a plurality of reports that utilize the Telecommunication Call<br>
Events for either a particular Telecommunication Device and/or user (i.e.,<br>
which may use a plurality of Telecommunication Devices). These reports<br>
include numerous combinations of the Telecommunications Call Events, in<br>
addition to correlating said Telecommunication Call Events with a plurality of<br>
database records. Reports can be a critical part of this invention, as those<br>
skilled in the art will agree. Making use of a multitude of Telecommunication<br><br>
Call Events is only possible by recognizing and illuminating the patterns and<br>
frequency of Telecommunication Call Events with their respective database<br>
records to the end user in a clear and simple format, which would not<br>
otherwise be possible if only the raw data is displayed. The invention provides<br>
a plurality of reports, without limitation, and including the following:<br>
•	Incoming Calls Report<br>
•	Outgoing Calls Report<br>
•	Missed Calls Report<br>
•	Contact Reports<br>
o Contact Call History<br>
o Last Time Group of Contacts were Called<br>
o Total Contact Call Time<br>
o Contact Normalized Call Time vs. User's Total Call Time<br>
o % of Calls that are Personal vs. Business<br>
•	New Account Report - Customers that are being Serviced<br>
•	Active Contacts — Current Contacts that are Active<br>
•	Neglected Contacts — Contacts that need Attention<br>
•	Active Accounts — Current Accounts that are Active<br>
•	Neglected Accounts — Accounts that need Attention<br>
•	Aging Reports - Contacts, Accounts, Opportunity, Leads, Forecast<br>
•	Return Call Response Time - The amount of time between a<br>
Contact calling a user and leaving a voice mail message, to the<br>
time the user returned the call to the Contact.<br>
•	Sales Reports<br>
•	Account and Contact Reports<br>
•	Opportunity and Forecast Reports<br>
•	Support Reports<br>
•	Lead Reports<br>
•	Fields Service Reports<br>
•	Wireless Airtime Billing Report - Associated wireless airtime<br>
charges and the user appropriate account.<br>
•	Opportunity ROI Report<br><br>
Based on recorded call information related to a specified Account's<br>
Opportunity that has Contacts associated with said Account. Each Account<br>
Opportunity has a monetary value and this report provides the<br>
Telecommunication Call Events information related to said Opportunities,<br>
such as including, but not limited to: Time of Calls, Frequency of Calls,<br>
Frequency of Return Calls from Contact, Return Call Response Time, or the<br>
like.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system<br>
that provides a plurality of maps of varying resolution and size reporting<br>
events, patterns, and/or frequencies of Telecommunication Call Events and<br>
their respected associated database records illustrating a spatial thematic<br>
representation of the data. In one embodiment, it is possible to spatially view<br>
the call history for a particular user and their Telecommunication Devices over<br>
a given period of time. In another embodiment, a thematic map of Accounts<br>
that the business organization has won or closed is illustrated spatially, which<br>
graphically depicts the amount of calls and visits made in the process of<br>
winning each Account.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system<br>
that provides a plurality of alerts and exceptions that are triggered based on the<br>
changes, modifications, or creation of Telecommunication Call Events and<br>
related database records. Alerts and Exceptions are configured by authorized<br>
users with the appropriate privileges to create, modify, or remove alert and<br>
exceptions for individual users of Telecommunication Devices. For example,<br>
in one embodiment, a user can request to be alerted when a specified<br>
Telecommunication Call Event occurs, such as to be notified when a call is<br>
made to a specified telephone number and/or NPA/NXX designation, such as<br>
with use a PBX phone system, or when a particular Contact is called or the<br>
Contact calls the user at one of their Telecommunication Devices (i.e., denoted<br>
as Telefencing). In another embodiment, notifications and alerts are used when<br>
a user's Telecommunication Device(s) have used a specified amount of<br>
airtime or bandwidth for a given period, or if the user's Telecommunication<br>
Device transitions from a roaming to non-roaming state or vise-versa.<br><br>
Additionally, this invention enables an alert when Telecommunication Call<br>
Events are made to a particular Telecommunication Device to notify a specific<br>
user or group of users that an action is required which is related to the user<br>
initiating the Telecommunication Call Events and/or to the user of said<br>
Telecommunication Device. In one embodiment, this alert can illustrate that a<br>
sales deal has been closed or moved to a different deal-stage. This invention<br>
allows alerts to be sent using various different commuracation methods, such<br>
as, and without limitation: E-Mail, SMS Messages, Instant Message,<br>
Telephone Call, Page, or the like.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system<br>
that provides the capability to access or download related Telecommunication<br>
Call Events and/or their associated database records to a computer device in<br>
both processed and raw formats. In one embodiment, a user is allowed to<br>
download Telecommunication Call Events in a comma delimited format (i.e.,<br>
CSV format) for the purpose of integrating said information into a<br>
spreadsheet for the tabulation of various fields that are not typically exposed<br>
through an online website report. This provides the user with ultimate<br>
flexibility in viewing the Telecommunication Call Events, such as the total<br>
call duration for a specified range of time. In another embodiment,<br>
downloading the Telecommunication Call Events and their associated<br>
database records enable the updating of Personal Information Management<br>
(PIM) applications, such as updating Contacts, Journals, Calendar Events,<br>
Tasks, or the like.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system<br>
that provides the capability to for the Telecommunication Device running an<br>
application to perform searches which can be transferred or synchronized to an<br>
online server system for later retrieval via the online server system, remote<br>
computer, or on the Telecommunication Device. It is an additional object of<br>
this invention to allow the searches to be performed on a remote computer that<br>
interfaces with the online server system and allows searches to be cached on<br>
the online server system which are later synchronized or transferred to the<br>
Telecommunication Device or remote computer. It is a further object of this<br>
present invention to allow the searches to include spatial related searches, such<br><br>
as Yellow Pages or White Pages searches, or POI searches for creating Routes<br>
on the phone, in order to allow the application running on the<br>
Telecommunication Device or remote computing device to transfer the<br>
searched places to the online server system or remote computer.<br>
For example, in one embodiment, a user that is authenticated and<br>
authorized by an application running on a wireless telephone is able to access<br>
the Internet and search for a Point of Interest (POI) or Place (e.g., such as a<br>
restaurant, airport, or the like). Those searched Places are then transferred to<br>
an online server system. When the user is authenticated and authorized via a<br>
web browser on a different computing device that has access to said online<br>
server system, the user is then able to retrieve and access the Places that were<br>
recently searched for on the user's wireless telephone. Additionally, from the<br>
web browser, the user is able to save the Place information into their own<br>
personal database and add additional objects of information, such as text<br>
notes, documents, articles, or the like, about the Place. It would be appreciated<br>
by those skilled in the art that searches performed on the Telecommunication<br>
Device are transferred to a remote database for future retrieval from disparate<br>
computing devices that have access to an online server system that stores the<br>
data records.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system<br>
that provides the capability for searching Places (i.e., POIs), saving Places,<br>
creating Routes/Directions, and saving Routes/Directions using a computing<br>
platform, which may include a Telecommunication Device, that is connected<br>
to an online server system, and then accessing said saved or searched Places,<br>
or saved or searched Routes/Directions from a Telecommunication Device. It<br>
is an additional object of this invention to allow the accessed Places and/or<br>
Route/Direction information to be integrated and associated with the<br>
Telecommunication Device's specific interfaces, such as GPS, Address Book,<br>
Voice Recorder, Camera, Phone Capability, SMS, or the like. The associated<br>
data (e.g., Place and its associated Camera Image(s), Route and its associated<br>
Camera Image(s), etc.) derived from the Telecommunication Device's specific<br>
interfaces can then be transferred or synchronized to the online server system<br>
or remote computer. After the synchronization or transfer process, the recently<br><br>
searched Place and/or Route/Direction information that is stored on the online<br>
server system now has additional database records (i.e., Camera Images, etc.)<br>
that were derived from the Telecommunication Device associated with the<br>
Place and /or Route/Direction information.<br>
It is an additional object of this invention to allow a<br>
Telecommunication Device to generate real-time maps based on retrieved<br>
Places' address information which was searched or saved on the online server<br>
system. It is an additional object of this invention to modify driving directions<br>
in real-time, while using a Telecommunication Device, which are based on<br>
driving directions that were searched or saved on the online server system. It is<br>
an additional object of mis invention to create new driving directions in real-<br>
time, while using a Telecommunication Device, which are based on Places<br>
that were searched or saved on the online server system. In one embodiment, a<br>
user that has a dentist appointment in an hour first signs in to a web page by<br>
entering a username and password. The user searches for the dentist using the<br>
web browser that is connected to an online server system that has access to<br>
Places (i.e., POIs, Yellow Pages, White Pages, etc.) information. By noting the<br>
general location and area of the dentist office and without saving the Place<br>
(i.e., the dentist office), the user takes their wireless telephone with them and<br>
drives to the dentist office. During the trip to the dentist office the user gets<br>
lost and needs to find his way to the location of the dentist office.<br>
The user signs in to an application that is running on the wireless<br>
phone and retrieves his recently searched Places that were searched for on the<br>
web. The user is then able to quickly map the dentist office (i.e., the Place)<br>
and even directly call the dentist office (i.e., since the Place information<br>
contains the phone number of the dentist), in the event that he might be late for<br>
his appointment. The user can do all this from his wireless telephone without<br>
having to perform a new search on the phone or call 411 to get the dentist<br>
office's phone number. Additionally this invention provides the user with the<br>
ability to dynamically create a route from their current location (i.e., route<br>
origin) to the dentist office (i.e., route destination) without having to enter in<br>
the destination address, which is very cumbersome on a wireless phone. In<br>
another embodiment, a user is able to retrieve a Place that was searched for<br><br>
and saved to the online server system from their wireless telephone by simple<br>
requesting recently saved Places by clicking on a menu option on their<br>
wireless telephone. After retrieving and selecting the desired Place the user is<br>
able to take a picture using the camera that is integrated into the wireless<br>
telephone, and then associate the picture with said Place on the wireless<br>
telephone application. Additionally, the application that is running on the<br>
user's wireless telephone will then transfer or synchronize the picture to the<br>
online server system so that when the user accesses the Place using a web<br>
browser on a laptop, the user will be able to see the picture that they took<br>
associated with the particular Place. Similarly, in another embodiment, the<br>
Place was not searched for on the web, but instead on the wireless phone. In a<br>
similar embodiment, a recently saved route was retrieved onto the wireless<br>
telephone and a set of pictures that were taken on the wireless phone were<br>
associated with the route and transferred or synchronized to the online server<br>
system for later viewing.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention provides a method and system for capturing,<br>
processing, mapping, reporting, and/or displaying Telecommunication Call<br>
Events that occur on either landline or wireless Telecommunication Devices<br>
(i.e., POTS telephones, cellular telephones, 3G-based wireless<br>
data/telephones, etc.), by which the information content of said<br>
Telecommunication Call Events can be presented locally on the<br>
Telecommunication Device or remotely on a desktop or laptop computer using<br>
a computer application or a web browser that can interface to an online<br>
networked server. This invention also provides for the synchronization or<br>
transfer of said Telecommunication Call Events either locally or remotely to<br>
another computing platform. This invention also provides the ability to<br>
associate said Telecommunication Call Events with various database records<br>
for a multitude of purposes, such as matching Telecommunication Call Events<br>
with a Contact database. This invention also enables associating<br>
Telecommunication Call Events with Contacts and other threads, such as<br>
Accounts, Opportunities, Forecasts, Leads, Tasks, Documents, Cases, other<br>
events, or the like. This invention also provides alerts, exceptions, and<br>
notifications that are related to the Telecommunication Call Events and<br>
associated database records. The present invention may be embodied in an<br>
online and Telecommunication Device application, such as the "AtlasBook"<br>
application owned and licensed by Networks In Motion, Inc. of Irvine,<br>
California.<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be<br>
described in detail with references to Figures 1-30.<br>
FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 illustrate high-level diagrams of a suitable<br>
computing and networking environment in which the various embodiments of<br>
the present invention may be implemented. The preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention will be described in the general context of an application that<br>
executes on an operating system in conjunction with a personal computer or<br>
server, but those skilled in the art will realize that this invention may also be<br>
implemented in combination with other program modules. Program modules<br>
typically include routines, programs, data structures, etc. that perform<br><br>
particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. This invention is<br>
not limited to a typical personal computer, but may also be utilized with other<br>
computing systems, such as handheld devices, mobile lap top computers,<br>
wireless phones, in-vehicle navigation systems, programmable consumer<br>
electronics, mainframe computers, distributed computer systems, etc., and the<br>
like.<br>
FIG. 1 is a network block diagram illustrating the connection (125 &amp;<br>
101) of both wireless 100 and wired 126 Telecommunication devices to an<br>
Application Service Provider (ASP) 123, also referred to as an online server<br>
system. This online server system may be configured at a single location and<br>
on a single computer, or can be configured as a distributed computer system<br>
and at different locations. The wireless Mobile Telecommunication Devices<br>
100 are wirelessly connected 101 to a nearby wireless base station 102, which<br>
are typically connected or have access to 105 the Internet, Intranet, or Extranet<br>
106. Additionally, a landline Telecommunication Device 126 is typically<br>
connected to a nearby central office 124 which is connected or has access to<br>
123 the Internet, Intranet, or Extranet 106. Additionally, the Application<br>
Service Provider (ASP) 123 also has access 109 to the Internet, Intranet, or<br>
Extranet 106. The ASP 123 generally consists of a front-end firewall and<br>
XML router 113 which itself has access (111 &amp; 114 &amp; 119) to other local<br>
computing modules, such as a database 112, POI server 115, geocoding server<br>
116, mapping server 117, and webpage client server 118. The web-server<br>
front-end 118 can be connected to the outside Internet, Intranet, or Extranet<br>
106 either through the local front-end firewall 113, or as in this embodiment,<br>
via 120 the web server 121, which is connected 122 directly to the Internet,<br>
Intranet, or Extranet 106 by using a software firewall which is well known to<br>
those skilled in the art. Additionally, either mobile 104 or landline 108<br>
computing devices, such as a personal computer, are connected to the Internet,<br>
Intranet, or Extranet 106, either directly 107 or through a wireless connection<br>
103 and base station 102.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a typical personal computer 150, that includes a<br>
central processing unit (CPU) 173, video adapter 172, hard disk drive 157,<br>
optical disk 158, serial port 159, magnetic disk drive 163, system bus 156, and<br><br>
network interface 176 → 177 &amp; 167 &amp; 169 → 109. The hard disk drive 157<br>
typically refers to a local non-volatile storage system for storing large amounts<br>
of data, such as a web browser program files or cookies or a user's Contact<br>
data. The optical disk 158 typically refers to a CD-ROM disk used for storing<br>
read-only data, such as an installation program. The serial port interface 159 is<br>
typically used to connect 161 the computer 150 to external devices 160, such<br>
as a keyboard, mouse, and graphical touch screen interface, and also can<br>
connect 164 to positioning devices 165, such as a GPS receiver. The keyboard<br>
and mouse 160, amongst other input devices 165, enable users to input<br>
information into the computer 150. The connection 161 &amp; 164 cables can<br>
include a serial cable or universal serial bus (USB) cable. Other input devices,<br>
that are not shown, may include a joystick, scanner, camera, microphone, or<br>
the like. The magnetic disk drive 163 is typically used to store small amounts<br>
data, in comparison to a hard 157 or optical 158 disk drive, and typically lacks<br>
the data transfer rates of those other storage drives, but it enables both<br>
readable and writable capability. <br>
The hard disk drive 157, optical disk drive 158, serial port interface<br>
159, and magnetic disk drive 163 are all preferably connected to the main<br>
system bus 156 of the computer 150 for transferring data. A monitor 170 or<br>
other type of display device, such as a LCD display, is connected 171 to the<br>
computer system's 150 video adapter 172, which is connected to the system<br>
bus 156. Additional peripheral output devices, which are not included in this<br>
embodiment, such as a printer, speaker, etc., can also be connected to a<br>
personal computer 150. The system bus 156 also connects to the network<br>
interface 176, central processing unit (CPU) 173, and system memory 151.<br>
The system memory 151 contains both random access memory (RAM) 153,<br>
and read only memory (ROM) 152, that typically consists of the BIOS (Basic<br>
Input/Output System) of the computer, necessary for containing basic routines<br>
that enable the transfer of information between elements within the personal<br>
computer 150. The RAM 153 stores a number of program modules, such as<br>
the web browser and synchronization applications 155, and the Operating<br>
System 154 of the personal computing device 150 or personal computer 150.<br><br>
One example of such a program module 155 would be a web browser that is<br>
connected to the "AtlasBook" server that was previously mentioned.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a next generation wireless Telecommunication<br>
Device 311 in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, which preferably includes a display 314, an antenna 313, and a<br>
keypad 312. The next generation wireless Telecommunication Device 311 &amp;<br>
300, as illustrated in FIG. 3, provides a foundation 302 for running programs<br>
or applications uiat can access the Telecommunication Device's 311 internal<br>
interfaces, such as the Bluetooth 309, Speech/Audio Codec 308, GPS Interface<br>
307, TAPI (Telephony Application Program Interface) 306 Interface,<br>
Screen/Keypad API (Application Program Interface) or Interface 305, Camera<br>
API 304, or the like as well known to those that are skilled in the art As those<br>
that are skilled in the art will appreciate, a Telecommunication Device (300 &amp;<br>
311) will also include scheduling/timers 310 for scheduling specific events as<br>
is provided with standard computing platforms. Additionally, next generation<br>
Telecommunication Devices (300 &amp; 311) have graphical user interfaces (GUI)<br>
301 for applications to allow user input using a graphical display 314. As<br>
people skilled in the art will appreciate, these next generation<br>
Telecommunication Devices provide the means to access the<br>
Telecommunication Devices' internal APIs using a middleware 302 platform,<br>
such as J2ME or BREW, which are both well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
This simplifies the development process since there is significant support for<br>
obtaining developer's access to the Telecommunication Devices internal APIs,<br>
such as the TAPI interface for making telephone calls and capturing call logs.<br>
Standard Telecommunication Devices provide an internal call logging<br>
capability, such as incoming call history 400, missed call history 401, and<br>
outgoing call history 402. Prior art solutions enabled the storage of vCard<br>
contact data on the Telecommunication Device, which is usually standard for<br>
wireless Telecommunication Devices. As those skilled in the art will<br>
appreciate, this invention provides the means to first run an application on the<br>
Telecommunication Device for the purpose of collecting Telecommunication<br>
Call Events, by using either Telecommunication Device timers 310, or by<br>
having the Telecommunication Device trigger the application when a<br><br>
particular Telecommunication Call Event occurs, such as when a telephone<br>
call is received, transmitted, or the like. As illustrated in FIG. 1, the wireless<br>
Telecommunication Device 100 is indirectly connected to the ASP server 123<br>
preferably by means of the Internet, Intranet, or Extranet 106. This provides a<br>
pathway for the synchronization or transfer of Telecommunication Call Events<br>
that are captured or recording on the Telecommunication Device to the ASP<br>
server 123. This transfer or synchronization process can occur in real-time or<br>
stored and then forwarded at a later time as previously mentioned in this<br>
invention.<br>
Once the Telecommunication Call Events have been transferred to the<br>
ASP server 123, the ASP server 123 can then correlate said<br>
Telecommunication Call Events with Contact data that is also located on the<br>
ASP server 123 system. Using the Telecommunication Call Events history, it<br>
is possible to correlate said history with actual contact data that is stored in the<br>
ASP server 123 system. For example, in one embodiment, a user many have<br>
1,000 Contacts' data (i.e., vCard data) stored on the online ASP 123 system.<br>

It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that Contact data has<br>
a plurality of telephone data, such as mobile, car, home, or the like, telephone<br>
fields in typical Contact data. As illustrated in FIG. 4 this Contact data may<br><br>
consist of Name (417 &amp; 412 &amp; 406), Account (418 &amp; 413 &amp; 407), Primary<br>
Telephone (419 &amp; 414 &amp; 408), Mobile Telephone (420 &amp; 415 &amp; 409), and<br>
Fax (421 &amp; 416 &amp; 410) fields, amongst other various fields 411 that were<br>
previous noted. Any given user can have a plurality of Contacts (403 &amp; 404 &amp;<br>
405) that are associated with either a single user or group of users in an<br>
organization or across multiple organizations. This Contact Data can also<br>
embody Point of Interest (POI) records, such as waypoints, or the like, since a<br>
Contact Data record is very similar to a phonebook listing (i.e., White Pages or<br>
Yellow Pages). As those skilled in the art know, Contact Data, White Pages,<br>
and Yellow Pages records can be categorized together with very similar fields.<br>
As further illustrated in FIG. 4, the preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention provides the linking, either by implicit or explicit threads or<br>
links (422 &amp; 423 &amp; 424), between call history (400 &amp; 401 &amp; 402) and<br>
Contact Data (403 &amp; 404 &amp; 405). For example, an incoming call history<br>
telephone number (949-555-1213) can be linked or threaded 422 to a Contact<br>
403 or group of Contacts, which may include POIs, or the like. Additionally,<br>
both missed call history 401 and outgoing call history 402 can also have<br>
threads or links (423 &amp; 420) to various Contacts (404 &amp; 405) or groups of<br>
Contacts.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, a Telecommunication Device runs or<br>
executes a program that collects and transfers Telecommunication Call Events<br>
in real-time, on schedule, at predefined intervals, or the like, for the purpose of<br>
processing the data, in this embodiment, at the ASP server 123 system. This<br>
unique approach enables the ability to provide a mechanism on the ASP server<br>
123 system to display said Telecommunication Call Events in a plurality of<br>
methods. FIG. 5 illustrates such a mechanism as the main home page 510 of a<br>
website after a user has been authenticated and authorized by the system. The<br>
web page 500 of the ASP server 123 system displays a row of headers, such as<br>
Home 518, Contacts 519, Leads 520, Accounts 521, Opportunities 522, Call<br>
History 523, Search 524, Find on Map 525, Directions 526, and Reports 527.<br>
Each main tab, such as Contacts 519, provides a submenu of information<br>
related to said tab subject or to the main essence of the application. For<br>
example, in this illustration the Contacts Tab 519 provides a submenu directly<br><br>
related to Contacts that allows a user to create a New Contact 511, New Lead<br>
512, New Account 513, and New Opportunity 514. Also provided in the<br>
Contacts Tab's 519 submenu are functions that indirectly reference Contacts,<br>
such as allowing a user to view its Incoming Calls 515, Outgoing Calls 516,<br>
and Missed Calls 517.<br>
This page also indicates the name of the user that is signed in to the<br>
website 532 and its organization 533, in addition to the current date 534.<br>
Additionally, each web page 500 provides common functions, such as by the<br>
Setup 528, Help 529, Trash Bin 530, and Logout 531 links to other web pages<br>
500. Other common features include the Search field 501, My Recent Contacts<br>
502, My Recent Places 509, and the Last Activity 503 consisting of the user's<br>
recent activity within the web page 500. The Last Activity 503 provides a<br>
cache of all recently accessed Contacts 504, Maps or Places 508, Routes 507,<br>
Opportunities 506, Leads, Accounts 505, Call History, or the like. My Recent<br>
Contacts 502 and My Recent Places 509 illustrate a more specific cache of<br>
only the recent contacts and places, respectively, that were searched. It should<br>
be appreciated by those that are skilled in the art, that if you search for a place<br>
on the ASP server 123 system, and it is displayed on the web page 500 in the<br>
My Recent Places 509 list, the same fields are accessible on a user's mobile<br>
device. For example, if a user searches for a Dentist office on the website it<br>
will be stored as a recent item in the user's My Recent Places 509 list. When<br>
that user is on the move, the user can access this location on its wireless<br>
telephone by simply searching its My Recent Places list. This part of the<br>
invention allows a user to easily and quickly mirror and retrieve Hie recent<br>
searches that the user performed on the web site 500 for fast retrieval on the<br>
mobile telephone.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 6, when you first visit the Contacts 519 web page<br>
500, the information displayed is a table 611 that lists the contacts whose<br>
information was recently viewed on the web page 500. Some standard fields<br>
provided include Contact Name 608, Company 609, and Phone Number 610.<br>
This Recently Viewed 600 contact web page provides a quick glance at the<br>
most recently viewed contacts. Additionally, a user can request to view a list<br>
of their contacts unfiltered (i.e., "All Contacts" 601), or by other filters, such<br><br>
as "Recently Edited" 602, "My Recent Contacts" 603, "My Recent Places"<br>
604, "Birthdays this Month" 605, Contacts "New Last Week" 606, and<br>
Contacts "New this Week" 607.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 7, the "All Contacts" view 700 provides a<br>
detailed view of all of a user's contacts. This view's 700 data can be sorted by<br>
a number of fields, such as Name 705, Company 706, Group 707, Title 708,<br>
Phone 709, E-Mail 710, or Owner 713. Contact data can be sorted and viewed<br>
701 alphabetically (i.e., A-Z), numerically (i.e., "123"), or viewed in its<br>
entirety (i.e., "All"). Each displayed set of contact data is numbered 702 and<br>
displayed to the user, and a user may view the next 711 and previous 712 sets<br>
of contact data easily. Additionally, the number of contact data records<br>
displayed at a time (i.e., per set) is preferably configurable 716. As people<br>
skilled in the art will appreciate, a user can edit 703 any contact or delete a<br>
single or multiple contacts 704. A user can also select contacts to be<br>
downloaded to the Telecommunication Device by checking the check box for<br>
the On Ph (on the phone) 715 field and clicking the Update 714 button. This<br>
enables the wireless phone to download the selected Contacts to the<br>
Telecommunication Device's local address book. As people in the art will<br>
appreciate, the Contact data can be compressed for download, and each<br>
contact can be identified by a pre-defined ID in order to allow for differential<br>
updates of contacts that have changed since the last download.<br>
Providing a full view of information about a particular Contact 800 is<br>
preferred in an address book application. FIG. 8 illustrates the main fields for<br>
providing said vCard fields. These fields include Name, Job Title, company<br>
Department, Birthday, Reports To, and Contact Source, as illustrated in one<br>
block of information 806. Another block of information 825 illustrates contact<br>
information, such as Work Phone, Work Fax, Mobile Phone, Home Phone, E-<br>
Mail Address, IM Address, and Web Page. Other information blocks include<br>
Contact Owner, vCard Group and Type 807, as well as information on the<br>
maintenance of the contact (i.e., Created By and Modified By) and its viewing<br>
Permissions 824.<br>
Address information is provided in separate blocks of information,<br>
such as Home 823 and Work Address fields 808, which provides the ability to<br><br>
map the contact in the application. Other contact fields blocks include a block<br>
809 with alternate email addresses (i.e., E-Mail 2, E-Mail 3) and Pager and<br>
Car Phone numbers, and a block 822 with the Home Fax number,<br>
Anniversary, Spouse, and Children information fields. A final block 810 is<br>
provided for the notes field. The summation of all of these individual blocks of<br>
information provides complete Contact (i.e., vCard) information for any<br>
contact. A user can also edit 801, copy 802, print 803, and delete 804 the<br>
contact. Finally, an image 826 associated with the Contact is displayed to the<br>
user alongside the other Contact data. This invention also allows a user to<br>
obtain driving directions 805 to and from the contact<br>
In accordance with the preferred embodiment, the Telecommunication<br>
Call Events made to the Telecommunication Devices associated with the<br>
signed-in user that were initiated or received by the viewed Contact are<br>
preferably displayed, as all of the Telecommunication Call Events that were<br>
captured for said user are stored on the online ASP 123 system. For example,<br>
in one embodiment as shown in FIG. 8, the call history 811 is provided for the<br>
user 800 that had calls with 812 various other Contacts, which may be the<br>
same said user or another user within the same team as said user. If a Contact<br>
name is provided, the Contact Owner field 820 is also displayed, since each<br>
contact belongs to someone (i.e., another user which is responsible for the<br>
maintenance of a contact). The call history 811 displays each call's "From<br>
Phone" 815 and "To Phone" 816 phone number identifiers, as well as the start<br>
817 and end 818 time of the call and the call's duration 819. This list only<br>
provides a subset of the complete call history for this Contact 800, and the<br>
user can choose the length of this displayed subset by selecting the number of<br>
records displayed per page 813. To view the Contact's 800 complete call<br>
history, a user can click on a button 814 in the webpage. Additionally, a user<br>
can also send an e-mail to this contact by clicking a different button 821 in the<br>
web page.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 9, preferably all of the contact fields can be<br>
edited, except the Created By and Modified By fields. Additionally in one<br>
embodiment, each contact can have different permissions 903 associated with<br>
it, since a contact can be shared by a group of users if it is a public contact. In<br><br>
one embodiment, each Contact can be placed in a folder or Group 901 and<br>
each Contact has an associated Type 902 that can be changed as shown below<br>
in the following tables.<br><br>
Furthermore, each Contact can have an image (826 &amp; 904) associated<br>
with it, which is uploaded to the server by clicking on the "Upload Contact<br>
Photograph" 905 button. The Path 906 of the image 904 on the local machine<br>
is displayed to the user in the web page. When all changes save been made, a<br>
user clicks a button to apply changes 900 using a mouse in a web browser,<br>
which is known to all people that are skilled in the art.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 10, it is possible to create a new Contact 1000<br>
and enter in all of the available information fields for a Contact, except the<br>
Created By and Modified By fields.<br><br>
Searching for Call History 1100 fox a team's members can be<br>
implemented using a date and time range. As illustrated in FIG. 11, a user can<br>
select either a predefined time range 1101, such as Today's date 1103 or can<br>
select from a group of time range identifiers 1102. For each search and in this<br>
preferred embodiment, a user is required to select the member or group of<br>
members 1104 and the type of call 1106, such as an mwming, outgoing, or<br>
missed call. In order to generate the call history view, after selecting the<br>
required fields, a user simply clicks on the generate button 1105.<br>
Additionally, this call history view 1100 preferably displays an<br>
overview of a team's members 1110 and their phone statistics, such as Last<br>
Phone Synchronization time 1111 and Last Login 1112 either on the phone or<br>
the web site, and provides links to view the call history 1120 for incoming<br>
1121, outgoing 1122, and missed 1123 calls. This view can also enable the<br>
remote synchronization of Telecommunication Call Events by checking a box<br>
1109 and clicking the synchronize button 1107. The team's call history<br>
information can also be printed by clicking on a print button 1108.<br>
When a Call History 1200 view is generated, it provides information<br>
illustrating the type of call history, such as incoming, outgoing, missed, or all<br>
calls 1201. The call history information identifies who the user had<br>
conversations with 1207 and can be generated for a plurality of<br>
Telecommunication Devices associated with the user's account. General call<br>
history information fields include "From Phone" 1208, "To Phone" 1209,<br>
"Start Time" 1210, "End Time" 1211, "Duration" 1212, and the "Contact<br>
Owner" 1213 of the contact if any exists. A link next to each phone number<br>
(both From and To) provides a way to Map (1215 &amp; 1216) that phone<br>
number's location at the time the call was made or received or Map (1215 &amp;<br>
1216) the vCard's home or business address that is associated with said phone<br>
number. The number of call history records per page (1214 &amp; 1206) can vary<br>
and previous 1204 or next 1205 page information can also be displayed. The<br>
entire or subset of said call history can be printed 1202 or exported 1203 by<br>
clicking the appropriate buttons on the web page.<br>
The preferred embodiment of the present invention also includes a find<br>
on map 1300 functionality, which, in one embodiment, allows a user to search<br><br>
and map addresses 1301, places 1302, area code and prefix phone number<br>
information 1303, and latitude and longitude map coordinates 1304. Every<br>
time an address is searched for and found it is stored for future use by the<br>
Recent Locations 1305 feature on the web page. This allows a drop down<br>
menu for users to select from a number of recent pre-defined locations that<br>
were mapped on the web page. When entering an address, typically the fields<br>
required are a street address 1306, city 1307, state 1308, zip code 1309, and<br>
country 1310. After all or a subset of said information has been entered, a map<br>
can be generated by clicking on a button or link 1311 in this embodiment.<br>
Finding a place or POI1302 is a similar process, but typically the only<br>
field that is required to be entered is the place name 1312 or description, such<br>
as the phone number, address, or the like as known to those that are skilled in<br>
the art. A map can be generated by clicking on a button or link 1313 in this<br>
embodiment. Additionally, a map of an area code and prefix 1303 can be<br>
obtained by entering said information 1314 and clicking on a button or link<br>
1315 in this embodiment. In a similar manner, a user can enter latitude 1316<br>
and longitude 1317 coordinates and click on a button or link 1318 in this<br>
embodiment to map the coordinates' location. For the case where a user<br>
entered a place name 1302 and requested a map 1313, if an exact match was<br>
not found a list of partial matches 1400 &amp; 1401 is provided, as illustrated in<br>
FIG. 14. This partial list of information will highlight the closest matches 1402<br>
and display a listing of the next immediate partial matches 1403. A user need<br>
only select a suitable match and click on a button or link 1404 to obtain a map<br>
in this embodiment.<br>
After a map has been obtained, as shown in FIG. 15, it will be<br>
displayed on a different web page 1500 illustrating the essence of the map<br>
1506 and a mechanism to zoom 1501 and pan 1506 around the map. The<br>
panning 1506 is simply performed by clicking on the new center point of the<br>
map as known to people that are skilled in the art, or by selecting some other<br>
button in the direction of the desired pan. A user can add this mapped location<br>
to their Contacts 1502 or can print 1503 or E-Mail 1504 this map.<br>
Additionally, this location can be added to an origin or destination of a route<br><br>
for the purpose of creating driving directions 1505 to or from this location. At<br>
anytime a user can obtain a new map 1507 for another location.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 16, one embodiment of this invention allows a<br>
user to request driving directions 1600 from an entered starting address (i.e.,<br>
origin) 1601 to an entered destination address 1604. A list of recent locations<br>
1603 is available to the user in addition to the standard fields for mapping a<br>
location, such as the street address 1605, city 1606, state 1607 and zip code<br>
1608. A user need only enter the required fields and may obtain a map by<br>
clicking on a button or link 1609 in this embodiment. After a successful search<br>
for the locations of the entered origin and destination addresses or selected<br>
locations is completed, a route is computed and driving directions are<br>
displayed in a new web page 1700. The resulting driving directions are<br>
summarized by displaying the start 1706 and end 1707 addresses, total trip<br>
driving distance, and total trip drive time 1710. Also provided is another<br>
opportunity to add the start 1706 or end 1707 address to the user's Contacts<br>
database by pressing a button next to the address (1708 &amp; 1709). As another<br>
means of summarizing the route, a map of the destination location 1704 and a<br>
map of the entire route 1705 are displayed. Detailed driving directions 1711<br>
are displayed in a list with route maneuver order numbers, maneuver<br>
instructions (i.e., "Turn Left on Jamboree Rd."), elapsed distance, and a<br>
graphical representation of the maneuver (i.e., left turn arrow). The driving<br>
directions view can be printed with the displayed maps 1702, without maps<br>
and just as text directions 1703, or can be emailed 1701.<br>
FIG. 18 illustrates the setup view 1801 which offers options available<br>
to a user setting up its account, and displays the user's name 1802 that the<br>
options apply to. The setup view 1801 may offer options for the following<br>
settings: Personal Settings 1803, such as editing the user's personal<br>
information or password; Tools 1804, such as wizards for importing or<br>
deleting numerous Contacts; Phone Settings 1805, such as adding, editing or<br>
deleting phones associated with said user's account, or changing the user's<br>
mobile access PIN; and Administration Settings 1806 for authorized users,<br>
such as for managing the members of the user's team, changing password<br>
policies, and viewing login history and member statistics.<br><br>
FIG. 19a illustrates the various fields associated with a user's Personal<br>
Information 1900, which is part of a user's Personal Settings 1803. The user's<br>
Personal Information 1900 fields are very similar to those of a Contact, since<br>
in a team this user can serve as a Contact and said user's Personal Information<br>
1900 can serve as that Contact's information. Personal Information 1900 fields<br>
may include several blocks of information. For example, general account<br>
settings (1905 &amp; 1911) may be described by username, nickname, permission<br>
level, user account status (active/disabled), last login date and time, disk space<br>
used by this account, user's time zone, user's preference for receiving the<br>
company's product newsletter, and the user's typical schedule for<br>
consideration in reports. More specific user identification information 1906<br>
can be specified by name, job title, company, department, birthday, the direct<br>
supervisor of the user, and the source of this user's involvement with the team,<br>
if there is one. The user can then categorize its own Group and Type, being its<br>
own Contact Owner 1907, and the user can identify its contact information as<br>
private if necessary 1913. A user's contact information includes the usual<br>
address and phone number fields, such as Work 1908 and Home 1914 Street<br>
Address, City, State, Zip, and Country, Work and Home Phone and Fax, and<br>
Mobile Phone numbers (1912 &amp; 1915). Other forms of contact such as Email<br>
Addresses, IM Address, Web Page, Pager and Car Phone numbers (1912 &amp;<br>
1909) can also be included. For more personal notes, the user can enter<br>
information about their Anniversary, Spouse, and Children 1915, or<br>
miscellaneous information in the Notes field 1910.<br>
Whenever a user's Personal Information 1900 is created or modified<br>
1913, the time of that activity is recorded and also displayed along with the<br>
information. Once a user's Personal Information 1900 is recorded, the user can<br>
Edit 1901 its own personal information, view or modify its Group Permissions<br>
1902, view its Login History 1903, or Change its Password 1904. From this<br>
detailed view of Personal Information 1900, a user can follow links provided<br>
to map the work or home address, to send an email to a clicked-on email<br>
address, to visit a clicked-on web page address (i.e., URL), or to view detailed<br>
call history for a clicked-on phone number.<br><br>
FIG. 19b illustrates a sample list of Groups and their Permissions<br>
1925, where each Group is identified by a pre-defined name 1926 and has a<br>
permission setting 1927. The permission setting 1927 determines if a Group,<br>
by which Contacts are grouped, is considered private or public. If a Group is<br>
made public, then all Contacts with that Group assignment are also made<br>
public and can be viewed in full detail by all team members. If a Group is<br>
made private, then all Contacts with that Group assignment are also made<br>
private and can be viewed in detail only by the Contact Owner.<br>
FIG. 19c illustrates an example of a user's login history 1950, where<br>
each login event is identified by the time the user signed in 1951, the IP<br>
Address the user logged in from 1952, and the result of the login attempt 1953,<br>
whether it succeeded or failed.<br>
FIG. 20 illustrates an example of a user's phone assignments 2000,<br>
which is part of a user's Phone Settings 1805. All of the user's phone<br>
assignments, that is, those phones that are associated with said user's account,<br>
are listed 2001, and each phone assignment is described by its phone number<br>
and the time the phone was activated on said user's account. A phone number<br>
can be treated as a unique identifier, because, as previously described, a phone<br>
number can only be associated to one account, although an account may have<br>
multiple phone numbers associated with it. A phone assignment may be<br>
removed at anytime by clicking a Remove button next to the phone number to<br>
be removed.<br>
A phone assignment may also be easily added, as illustrated in FIG.<br>
21. A user may add a phone 2100, which is part of a user's Phone Settings<br>
1805, for its own account, of for another team member's account if the user<br>
has the appropriate permissions. The user whose account the phone<br>
assignment is being added to is identified by displaying that user's username<br>
2601. In one embodiment, to add a phone assignment the user needs two<br>
pieces of information, the phone number 2102 and the phone's PIN 2103. The<br>
phone's PIN 2103 is obtained during the phone application's registration<br>
process, which requires communication with the server to allow the server to<br>
authorize registration, ensuring the phone number in question is not assigned<br>
to any other user accounts, and to allow the server to provide the phone<br><br>
application with a valid PIN. The phone's owner or user then uses that PIN on<br>
the web page to complete the process of associating that phone to the user's<br>
account. This ensures that the user requesting the phone addition has physical<br>
access to the phone, either directly or indirectly through a communicating<br>
phone user, and is thereby permitted to request the assignment. To complete<br>
the addition of a phone assignment, the user enters the required information<br>
and presses the Add Phones button 2104. Once the phone number is cleared<br>
for assignment and the PIN is verified, the new phone assignment is complete.<br>
Another part of a user's Phone Settings 1805 is the ability to change<br>
the user's Mobile Access PIN 2200, as illustrated in FIG. 22. The Mobile<br>
Access PIN is the password used on the phone's application to access the<br>
user's account features, such as Contacts, My Recent Places, etc. The<br>
username 2201 for the user whose Mobile Access PIN will be changed is<br>
specified 2202, since users with appropriate permissions can also change<br>
another user's Mobile Access PIN. This may be useful, for example, when an<br>
employee leaves a company and the supervisor wants to ensure that the ex-<br>
employee can not access his/her old account anymore. To set a new Mobile<br>
Access PIN, the user enters the new Mobile Access PIN 2203 and confirms<br>
the entry by typing it in again 2204, and then presses the Apply Changes<br>
button 2205 to complete the change.<br>
For use by teams, a team administrator should preferably be able to<br>
quickly view and modify the teams account settings. FIG. 23 illustrates the<br>
Administration Settings 2300 that a team administrator can use to manage the<br>
team's members. A team administrator can get a quick overview of the team in<br>
a tabular format, such as that illustrated, which summarizes each team<br>
member's name 2307, username 2308, nickname 2309, account status (active<br>
or disabled) 2310, and permission level 2311. Each member's information can<br>
be edited, simply by clicking on the Edit link 2305. next to the member's<br>
name, or by clicking on the links on the member's name 2307, username 2308,<br>
and nickname 2309. Multiple members' password can be reset by the<br>
administrator by checking the Password Reset checkbox 2306 next to each<br>
member whose password should be reset and pressing the Update button 2301.<br>
This overview of the team's member can be sorted, by clicking on any of the<br><br>
column headers, such as Name 2307, and can also be sorted by a specific letter<br>
or numerically 2302. The number of team members to display per web page<br>
2312 may be selectable and the page number currently being viewed 2303 is<br>
also displayed. An administrator can move from page to page using Previous<br>
Page and Next Page links 2304. Clicking on a user's account status link 2310<br>
will allow the administrator to change that user's account status from Active to<br>
Disabled or Disabled to Active. Clicking on a user's Permission Level link<br>
2311 will allow the user to change that user's permission level, giving them<br>
more or less account privileges that their current settings provide. For<br>
example, a user who has Permission Level Account Manager can be made into<br>
an Administrator in order to increase that user's access and/or control over<br>
more of the team's functions and settings. Likewise, a user may be given a<br>
lower Permission Level in order to restrict that user's access and/or control<br>
more over the team's and/or user account's functions and settings.<br>
FIG. 24 illustrates an additional safety feature that helps administrator<br>
ensure their users' account information is accessed only by those users.<br>
Another part of Administration Settings 2300, Password Policies 2400 allow<br>
an administrator to require that all team members reset their passwords<br>
routinely in order to keep passwords secure and less prone to hacking 2401.<br>
To do this, an administrator simply specifies an expiration period 2405, after<br>
which the team's current passwords expire. To ward off hacker attempts, the<br>
administrator can set the maximum number of failed login attempts 2402<br>
before a login attempt is no longer allowed. This too is a setting that can be<br>
changed simply by editing the current value displayed 2406. Once the<br>
maximum number of failed login attempts 2402 has been reached, the user<br>
attempting to login is "locked out" for a pre-defined period of time 2403. This<br>
lockout effective period 2403 can be adjusted from its current value simply by<br>
changing the period value 2407. Any changes made to any of the Password<br>
Policies values can be applied by pressing the Apply Changes button 2404.<br>
Another part of Administrator Settings 2300 is being able to view<br>
Member Statistics 2500, as illustrated in FIG. 25. The administrator can get an<br>
at-a-glance overview of the team's usage of the application and the website<br>
and the amount of storage space currently used. This overview summarizes the<br><br>
whole team's statistics, such as by displaying the total number of contacts<br>
created by the team 2501 or the total amount of disk space used by the team<br>
2502. The overview also summarizes each member's statistics in a tabular<br>
format, where the members can be viewed alphabetically, by a particular<br>
letter, or numerically 2503. Each team member in the overview is identified by<br>
its name 2505 and username 2506, and the member's displayed statistics<br>
include the number of contacts created 2507, the number of contacts<br>
synchronized to the phone 2508, and the amount of disk space used by that<br>
team member's account 2509. Clicking on any of the column headers sorts the<br>
overview list according to the clicked column data type. Clicking on the links<br>
where the data values are, such as on the team member's name or username,<br>
will link to more information on that user in reference to the data type clicked.<br>
Multiple web pages of members may be necessary, depending on the number<br>
of members the administrator chooses to display per page 2511, and the<br>
administrator can scroll to the next and previous pages using a link 2510,<br>
while the currently viewed page is numbered and displayed 2504.<br>
As people skilled in the art will appreciate, searching for Places and<br>
Trips (i.e., Directions or Routes) on a mobile wireless telephone is a daunting<br>
task, primarily due to the limited form factor of the wireless telephone (i.e.,<br>
Telecommunication Device). As illustrated in FIG. 26 a wireless telephone<br>
2600	is comprised of a display 2601 and a keypad 2614. As people skilled in<br>
the art understand, a user can maneuver around a wireless telephone's GUI<br>
2601	using a rocker 2603 and a select button 2602 which simulates the<br>
functionality of a personal computer mouse. For this embodiment, as<br>
illustrated in FIG. 26, a GUI 2607 is shown displaying a menu of options that<br>
illustrates a graphical interface for searching for places (2609 &amp; 2611) and<br>
trips (2610 &amp; 2612) and for displaying maps 2613 on a wireless telephone.<br>
This GUI 2607 is illustrated by magnifying the projection (2604 &amp; 2605) of<br>
the wireless phone's GUI 2607 in order to aid in the illustration of this<br>
invention.<br>
In one embodiment, using a web browser it is possible to display a web<br>
page 2715 that illustrates the core functionality of finding a Place. A Place<br>
2700 is typically defined as having a geographical location, such as an address<br><br>
which can further derive a Place's latitude and longitude coordinates. A Place<br>
2700 that is derived from a realizable address can be shown on a Map 2705 of<br>
varying resolution and size. A Map typically allows a user to zoom in or out<br>
2703 or to pan around the Map 2705. As illustrated in this invention, a Place<br>
2700 does not have to be saved, as required by prior art systems. As people<br>
skilled in the art will appreciate, geographical locations (i.e., Places) that were<br>
found using the ASP system 123 aie cached by the system and displayed to the<br>
user in the Last Activity 2706 portion of the web page 2715. This illustrates<br>
not only saved and cached (i.e., not purposely saved by the user) Places (2707<br>
&amp; 2708 &amp; 2709), but also saved and cached Trips (2710 &amp; 2711 &amp; 2712).<br>
Saved Places and Trips are accessible using the "My Recent Places" 2714 and<br>
"My Recent Trips" 2713 links from this web page 2715. The "Last Activity"<br>
2706 preferably embodies all activity (i.e., in reverse chronological order)<br>
initiated by the user on the web page 2715 and on one or more of their<br>
Telecommunication Devices or remote computing devices, and which was<br>
registered since the user was authenticated and recorded by the ASP system<br>
123. For example, a user may have searched fiom the Place "My Fishing Hole<br>
#2" 2708 on their wireless telephone and then searched for the address "18872<br>
Bardeen Avenue, Irvine, CA 92612" via the web page 2715. This search is<br>
illustrated in the "Last Activity" 2706 section of this web page. It should be<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art that this "Last Activity" 2706 illustrates<br>
searches from multiple computing devices that had, at one time, a direct<br>
connection with the ASP system 123. It should also be appreciated by those<br>
skilled in the art that any geographical search (e.g., POI, Address,<br>
Latitude/Longitude Coordinates, etc.), can be saved as a Place 2701 or<br>
waypoint. Additionally, any geographical search can be used as a route<br>
destination point 2702 (i.e., Start, End, Via, or Stop point). FIG. 27 illustrates<br>
only a Start and End 2702 point, however this invention supports Via and Stop<br>
points as known to those that are skilled in the art. Additionally, a user can<br>
initiate a geographical search 2704 from this web page 2715 to find another<br>
Place 2700.<br>
Additionally, FIG. 28a illustrates a GUI display (2800 &amp; 2601) of the<br>
"Recent Places" 2801 view on the wireless telephone 2600. It should be<br><br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art that this "Recent Places" 2801 view<br>
illustrates Places that were both saved and viewed or searched on the wireless<br>
telephone 2600 and on the web page 2715. As people skilled in the art will<br>
appreciate, this allows a user to plan on the web page 2715 and view the<br>
results on their wireless telephone without having to initiate the search on the<br>
wireless telephone's 2600 application. For example, in this embodiment the<br>
user had searched for a map of the address "18872 Bardeen Avenue, Irvine,<br>
CA 92612" using the wireless telephone 2600, but also searched previously on<br>
the web page 2715 for their stored Places (2803 &amp; 2804 &amp; 2806) and searched<br>
addresses 2805 and POI's (2806 &amp; 2807) that were done while signed in to the<br>
web page 2715 that was accessing the ASP system 123.<br>
Illustrated in FIG. 28b, after searching for a Place 2851 on the wireless<br>
telephone 2600 a user is able to display the Recent Place's 2850 detailed<br>
information. This information can consist of a business 2852 address 2853,<br>
telephone 2854, fax number 2855, e-mail address 2856 and a link to view a<br>
Map 2857 of this Place's location or create a route 2858 to the Place's address<br>
2853. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that a route can be<br>
dynamically generated using the wireless telephone's 2600 GPS interface 307<br>
to create a real-time route from the mobile position of the wireless telephone<br>
2600.<br>
Similar to the "Recent Places" 2801 view, as illustrated in FIG. 29, is<br>
the "Recent Trips" 2901 view on the wireless telephone's 2600 GUI display<br>
(2900 &amp; 2601). It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that this<br>
"Recent Trips" 2901 view illustrates Trips that were both saved and viewed on<br>
the wireless telephone 2600 and on the web page 2715. As people skilled in<br>
the art will appreciate, this allows a user to plan on the web page 2715 and<br>
view the results on their wireless telephone without having to create a Trip on<br>
the wireless telephone's 2600 application. For example, in this embodiment<br>
the user had created a Trip starting from the address "18872 Bardeen Avenue,<br>
Irvine, CA 92612" to the destination address "32314 Golden Lantern, Laguna<br>
Niguel, CA 92677' on the web page 2715 as illustrated in FIG. 16 &amp; FIG. 17.<br>
The wireless telephone 2600 displays and can retrieve both the created and<br>
cached Trips 2904, as well as the created and saved Trips (i.e., Trips that were<br><br>
named) (2902 &amp; 2903 &amp; 2905 &amp; 2906) from either the ASP system 123 or the<br>
Trips that were created and/or stored on the wireless telephone 2600.<br>
FIG. 30 depicts a Trip 3012 and Driving Directions 3000 which were<br>
calculated and displayed using a web page 3028 as known to those that are<br>
skilled in the art. As those that are skilled in the art will appreciate, FIG. 30<br>
illustrates the method and system for creating a Trip 3012 with a plurality of<br>
destination points (3008 &amp; 3010 &amp; 3013) including a start point (3006 &amp;<br>
3001) and an end point (3016 &amp; 3002). A Trip 3012 can be associated with a<br>
plurality of database records (3007 &amp; 3009 &amp; 3011 &amp; 3014 &amp; 3015) that were<br>
created and synchronized or transferred from the Telecommunication Device<br>
and were collected using the Telecommunication Device's specific interfaces,<br>
such as a camera interface 304 as illustrated in FIG. 3. For example, in one<br>
embodiment, a user plans a Trip 3012 on the web page 3028. The Trip has a<br>
travel time and driving distance 3005 as known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Additionally, the Trip has start 3001 and end 3002 points, which in this<br>
invention can be added to a user's saved Places using the "Add to Place"<br>
buttons for both the start 3003 and end 3004 points. After the user creates a<br>
route, they can journey along the route and take pictures or images using their<br>
wireless telephone's integrated camera 304. This allows a user to associate<br>
their Trip 3012 with the wireless telephone's camera. Each image (3007 &amp;<br>
3009 &amp; 3011 &amp; 3014 &amp; 3015) that is recorded along the Trip 3012 has a time<br>
stamp and GPS coordinates that are associated with the image. Images with<br>
GPS coordinates are not required, but are the preferred embodiment for this<br>
invention.<br>
After the images have been taken, they can be synchronized or<br>
transferred in real-time or in a batch process to the ASP system 123. One the<br>
user signs back into the web page 3028, they are able to review their entire trip<br>
and the photographs that they recorded during their Trip 3012 in the order that<br>
they took the pictures. As people that are skilled in the art will appreciate, the<br>
web page 3028 displays a timeline 3017 illustrating the chronological<br>
procession of the trip and the start 3018, destination (3020 &amp; 3022 &amp; 3024),<br>
and end point 3027 of the Trip 3012, in addition to the images that were taken<br>
along the Trip (3019 &amp; 3021 &amp; 3023 &amp; 3025 &amp; 3026) that map directly to the<br><br>
locations where the images were taken on the mapped route (3007 &amp; 3009 &amp;<br>
3011 &amp; 3014 &amp; 3015). It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that<br>
the Trip does not need to be created in advance, since a Trip is defined as<br>
having a Start and an End location, all of which can be calculated using a GPS<br>
device, which can determine when a device, such as a wireless telephone, has<br>
stopped moving for a defined period of time or the like. This type of GPS<br>
application that determines when a Telecommunication Device has stopped<br>
moving is currently available in the art. One embodiment of this type of<br>
application that determines when a wireless telephone has stopped moving is<br>
known as the "AtlasTrack" application owned and licensed by Networks In<br>
Motion, Inc. of Irvine, California. When a user signs into the web page 3028,<br>
the user is able to review their images in a Trip or Route format which was<br>
automatically created by the ASP system 123, and displayed to the user for<br>
their review. This allows a user to view their photographs both chronologically<br>
and spatially.<br>
It should be noted that the present invention may be embodied in forms<br>
other than the preferred embodiments described above without departing from<br>
the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. The specification contained<br>
herein provides sufficient disclosure for one skilled in the art to implement the<br>
various embodiments of the present invention, including the preferred<br>
embodiment, which should be considered in all aspect as illustrative and not<br>
restrictive; all changes or alternatives that fall within the meaning and range or<br>
equivalency of the claim are intended to be embraced within.<br><br>
