				<td>The present invention relates to a method enabling a<br>
plurality of transponders present simultaneously in the<br>
field of analysis apparatus to be identified, and also to<br>
analysis apparatus and to a set of transponders for<br>
implementing such a method.<br>
Numerous analysis apparatuses are known that enable<br>
a transponder to be identified, for example to control<br>
access to a building.<br>
Most such analysis apparatuses are adapted to<br>
identify only a small number of transponders at a time,<br>
which is not a problem when controlling access to a<br>
building since the number of people, and thus the number<br>
of transponders, capable of arriving simultaneously in<br>
the field of the analysis apparatus is no more than about<br>
ten .<br>
By way of example, mention can be made of European<br>
patent application EP 0 285 419 which describes analysis<br>
apparatus for requiring n successive interrogations to<br>
determine an n-bit identity code.<br>
Such analysis apparatus is unsuitable for the case<br>
where the identity code of each transponder is encoded on<br>
a large number of bits, e.g. 32 bits, and where a large<br>
number of transponders, e.g. more than 50, are present<br>
simultaneously in the field of the analysis apparatus.<br>
Unfortunately, this situation arises when<br>
transponders are used for remote identification of<br>
articles present in a container and for providing<br>
information concerning their origins, for example.<br>
A particular object of the present invention is to<br>
enable a plurality of transponders to be identified in a<br>
relatively short length of time, for example to be able<br>
to determine how many of them there are, and to be able<br>
to address each of them separately to interrogate them.<br><br>
The invention achieves this by a novel method of<br>
identifying a set of transponders situated in the field<br>
of analysis apparatus, each transponder having a<br>
different identity code in memory, the method being<br>
characterized by the fact that it comprises the steps<br>
consisting in:<br>
a) causing the analysis apparatus to transmit data<br>
for comparison with a portion of the identity code as<br>
selected by the analysis apparatus;<br>
b) causing each as-yet unidentified transponder to<br>
compare the received data and the portion of its identity<br>
code as selected by the analysis apparatus;<br>
c) causing each as-yet unidentified transponder to<br>
transmit in at least one time window selected from a set<br>
of time windows common to the set of transponders as a<br>
function of the result of said comparison; and<br>
d) causing the analysis apparatus to analyze the<br>
data transmitted by the transponders in said set of time<br>
windows, and when the data transmitted by the<br>
transponders does not enable a transponder identity code<br>
to be determined, at least in part, causing the apparatus<br>
to start again with data that has been modified in such a<br>
manner that, within a finite number of iterations, the<br>
transponders are caused to transmit data enabling the<br>
identity code of at least one of the transponders to be<br>
determined, at least in part.<br>
In a preferred implementation of the method, each<br>
transponder includes a comparison register in which the<br>
data for comparison is stored.<br>
This comparison register is preferably organized to<br>
store a plurality of binary words, and the identity code<br>
is likewise made up of binary words.<br>
In a preferred implementation of the invention, the<br>
analysis apparatus modifies, one at a time, a binary word<br>
of given significance in the comparison register, and<br>
each as-yet unidentified transponder compares the most-<br><br>
recently modified word with the binary word of<br>
corresponding significance of the identity code.<br>
The portion of the identity code that is to be<br>
subjected to comparison is selected by selecting the<br>
significance of each new binary word that is to be stored<br>
in the comparison register.<br>
Preferably, the method of the invention further<br>
comprises the step consisting in:<br>
â€¢ causing the analysis apparatus, whenever the data<br>
previously received thereby makes this possible, to<br>
determine at least a portion of the identity code of one<br>
or more transponders, to send an order causing said<br>
transponder(s) to transmit its/their identity code(s);<br>
and<br>
analyzing said identity code(s) as received to<br>
determine whether only one identity code was transmitted<br>
or whether there has been interference associated with a<br>
plurality of different codes being transmitted<br>
simultaneously, and in the event of only one identity<br>
code being received, storing said code.<br>
Results that are particularly satisfying in terms of<br>
the time required to identify all of the transponders<br>
have been obtained when the identification method<br>
comprises the steps consisting in:<br>
a) using the analysis apparatus to transmit data to<br>
be compared with a portion of the identity code selected<br>
by the analysis apparatus;<br>
b) within each unidentified transponder, comparing<br>
the received data and a corresponding portion of the<br>
transponder's identity code;<br>
c) causing each unidentified transponder to transmit<br>
in at least one time window selected from a set of time<br>
windows common to the set of transponders;<br>
d) using the analysis apparatus to analyze the data<br>
transmitted by the transponders in said set of time<br>
windows, and when the data transmitted by the<br>
transponders does not enable at least part of the<br>
identity code of at least one of the transponders to be<br>
identified, beginning again with data modified in such a<br>
manner that, after a finite number of iterations, the<br>
transponders transmit data making it possible to<br>
determine at least a part of the identity code of at<br>
least one of the transponders;<br>
e) causing the analysis apparatus, when the data<br>
previously received thereby makes it possible to<br>
determine at least a portion of the identity code of one<br>
or more transponders, to transmit an order causing every<br>
such transponder to transmit its own identity code; and<br>
f) analyzing reception of the identity code to<br>
determine whether a single identity code has been<br>
transmitted or whether interference has occurred<br>
associated with simultaneous transmission of a plurality<br>
of different codes, and when only one identity code is<br>
received, storing said code.<br>
Preferably, when a plurality of transponders<br>
transmit a plurality of different identity codes<br>
simultaneously and they interfere with one another, the<br>
method of the invention further includes the step<br>
consisting in sending new data to be compared with a new<br>
portion of the identity code in said transponders, other<br>
than the portion already determined by the analysis<br>
apparatus, optionally in modifying said new data until<br>
said new identity code portion has been determined, and<br>
thereafter in causing the transponder(s) for which the<br>
new identity code portion has been determined to transmit<br>
its/their identity code(s), and in the event of<br>
interference restarting the process for determining the<br>
identity code again by causing the comparison to be<br>
performed on an as-yet undetermined portion of the<br>
identity code, until only one identity code is received<br>
from the transponders.<br>
In a preferred implementation of the method of the<br>
invention, each identified transponder is put into a<br>
standby mode in which it ceases to transmit the result of<br>
comparing its own identity code with the data transmitted<br>
by the analysis apparatus.<br>
Preferably each transponder that has been<br>
identified is put into said standby mode by using the<br>
analysis apparatus to transmit its identity code. The<br>
identity code is advantageously transmitted by loading<br>
said identity code into the comparison register, with the<br>
transponder whose comparison register matches its<br>
identity code then putting itself into a standby mode.<br>
The invention also provides a transponder of the<br>
type comprising an identification code such as a serial<br>
number stored in a memory and means for remote<br>
communication with analysis apparatus, the transponder<br>
being characterized by the fact that it includes a<br>
comparison register in which data from the analysis<br>
apparatus can be stored, calculation means for comparing<br>
at least a portion of the identity code with at least a<br>
portion of the comparison register, and means for<br>
transmitting the result of the comparison in at least one<br>
time window selected from a set of time windows, the<br>
particular time window depending on the result of the<br>
comparison.<br>
The invention also provides analysis apparatus for a<br>
plurality of transponders having different identity<br>
codes, the apparatus being characterized by the fact that<br>
it includes processor means organized to determine the<br>
identity codes of a plurality of transponders placed in<br>
the field of the analysis apparatus, said analysis<br>
apparatus being suitable for:<br>
transmitting a write order associated with<br>
identity data, said order causing said identity data to<br>
be stored in the transponders at a particular address<br>
selected by the analysis apparatus;<br>
analyzing the response from as-yet unidentified<br>
transponders in a set of time windows after said identity<br>
data has been transmitted;<br>
transmitting a read order to cause the<br>
transponders whose identity codes have been determined in<br>
part to send their identity codes in full;<br>
transmitting a new write order associated with new<br>
identity data in the event of interference between the<br>
data transmitted by the transponders, so as to end up by<br>
causing only one transponder at a time to send its<br>
identity code, and storing said code; and<br>
repeating the above steps so as to identity all of<br>
the transponders in turn.<br>
The invention also provides analysis apparatus and a<br>
set of transponders for implementing a method as defined<br>
above.<br>
By means of the invention, it is possible to<br>
identify a large number of transponders in a relatively<br>
short length of time, and to do so even if the identity<br>
code of each transponder is encoded on a large number of<br>
bits, e.g. 32 bits.<br>
Other characteristics and advantages of the present<br>
invention appear on reading the following detailed<br>
description of a non-limiting implementations of the<br>
invention, and on examining the accompanying drawings, in<br>

analysis apparatus;<br>

performing the first implementation of the invention; and<br>
Figure 7 shows how an identification process takes<br>
place in the presence of four transponders when<br>
performing a second implementation of the invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows a plurality of transponders 1 placed<br>
in the magnetic field of an antenna 2 of analysis<br>
apparatus 3, which apparatus includes a transmitter-<br>
receiver connected to the antenna 2 and processor means 5<br>
such as a microcomputer for processing information<br>
received by the transmitter-receiver 4 and for<br>
controlling transmission thereby.<br>
The antenna 2 is constituted by a solenoid within<br>
which the field is substantially constant.<br>
The analysis apparatus 3 is organized to identify<br>
transponders 1 that are located inside the antenna 2,<br>
with the field being strong enough to deliver sufficient<br>
energy to the transponders to enable them to be<br>
activated.<br>
By way of example, the transponders 1 are in the<br>
form of labels and they are all contained in a common<br>
enclosure inside the antenna 2, which enclosure is<br>
represented by dashed lines.<br>
In the example described, information is<br>
interchanged by amplitude modulation of a signal at a<br>
frequency of 125 kHz.<br>
Figure 2 shows a transponder 1.<br>
The transponder has an internal antenna 6 coupled to<br>
a tuning capacitor 7, a rectifier circuit 8 to rectify<br>
the current induced in the antenna 6, a capacitor 9 for<br>
smoothing the current rectified in this way, and a<br>
circuit 10 which is programmed to perform certain<br>
functions in response to orders received from the<br>
analysis apparatus 3, in particular to cause data to be<br>
transmitted by the transponder, which functions are<br>
described in greater detail below.<br>
The circuit 10 is coupled to a transmitter 11 to<br>
modulate and transmit data to the analysis apparatus 3,<br>
via the antenna 6, and a receiver 12 to demodulate and<br>
receive data transmitted by the analysis apparatus 3, in<br>
conventional manner.<br>
The transponder 1 also has a memory 13 of the EEPROM<br>
type, associated with the circuit 10.<br>
In the memory 13, a serial number S is written in<br>
non-erasable manner, which number is encoded on four<br>
bytes S3, S2, S1, S0 giving a total of 32 bits.<br>
The circuit 10 has a buffer memory referred to below<br>
as the comparison register H, and capable of storing four<br>
respective addresses H3, H2, H1, and H0, as shown in<br>
Figure 4.<br>
It is assumed below that all of the transponders<br>
placed in the field of the antenna 2 have different<br>
serial numbers.<br>
Figure 3 shows a first implementation of the method<br>
of the invention.<br>
In the example described, when the magnetic field of<br>
the antenna 2 is established, all of the transponders<br>
start continuous transmission of preprogrammed<br>
information.<br>
That is why the method begins in step 20 by<br>
silencing the transponders 1. To do this, the analysis<br>
apparatus 3 sends a specific instruction to the<br>
transponders 1 to place all of them in a "listen" mode,<br>
in which they do not transmit unless instructed to do so,<br>
i.e. they transmit only in response to particular<br>
instructions transmitted by the analysis apparatus 3.<br>
In following step 21, it is assumed that all of the<br>
transponders are in listen mode.<br>
In step 22, the analysis apparatus 3 transmits an<br>
order to write the value m at address Hn, where the value<br>
of the index n generally lies in the range 0 to 3, and is<br>
equal to 0 at the beginning of the identification<br>
process.<br>
The value m is encoded on 8 bits, and it lies in<br>
general in the hexadecimal range 00 to FF. m is<br>
initially given the hexadecimal value 80.<br>
At step 23, all of the transponders 1 store the<br>
value m at address Hn, i.e. the value 80 at address H0 at<br>
the beginning of the identification process.<br>
Thereafter, in step 24, the transponders 1 compare<br>
the contents of address Hn with the corresponding byte Sn<br>
of their respective serial numbers.<br>
At the beginning of the identification process, n is<br>
equal to 0 and the transponders 1 therefore compare the<br>
least significant byte H0 in their comparison registers 8<br>
with the least significant bytes S0 of their serial<br>
numbers.<br>
The comparison in question consists in determining<br>
whether the value m stored at address Hn is greater than,<br>
equal to, or less than Sn.<br>
When the comparison does not apply to the least<br>
significant byte S0, then the transponder 1 also checks in<br>
the presently-described implementation for a match<br>
between the contents of each address of lower<br>
significance and each corresponding address of its serial<br>
number.<br>
In other words, if a comparison is being made, for<br>
example, on byte S2 of the serial number, then the<br>
transponder 1 also checks for a match between bytes S1 and<br>
S0 and the contents of address h1 and H0 respectively.<br>
As a function of the result of the comparison, and<br>
as explained possibly also providing that the contents of<br>
the less significant addresses and the corresponding<br>
bytes of the serial number match, each transponder 1<br>
responds in a step 25 by transmitting during a<br>
predetermined time window, unless the analysis apparatus<br>
has already put the transponder into a standby mode, as<br>
described below.<br>
Transmission from the transponders 1 takes place in<br>
the presently-described implementation in one of four<br>
groups G3, G2, G1, and G0, each of three time windows, with<br>
each group Gn being associated with a different value for<br>
the index n.<br>
The three successive time windows of each group Gn<br>
correspond respectively to the case where Sn is less than<br>
the contents of the address Hn which is written Sn 
Figure 5, to the case where they are equal which is<br>
written Sn = Hn, and to the case where Sn is greater than<br>
the contents of the comparison register at address Hn<br>
which is written Sn &gt; Hn.<br>
As shown in Figure 5, the first group G3 of time<br>
windows extends between instants t1 and t4, the second<br>
group G2 between instants t4 and t7, the third group G1<br>
between instants t7 and t10, and the fourth group G0<br>
between instants t10 and t13.<br>
All of the time windows are of the same duration.<br>
Instant t1 is situated at a predetermined time interval<br>
from the end of data transmission by the analysis<br>
apparatus.<br>
At step 26, the analysis apparatus 3 analyzes the<br>
responses coming from the transponders 1.<br>
For each group Gn of three time windows, eight<br>
situations can arise:<br>
the first situation corresponds to the analysis<br>
apparatus 3 receiving a signal 111, i.e. receiving binary<br>
value 1 in each of the three time windows of a single<br>
group Gn allocated to the result of the comparison between<br>
the contents of address Hn in the comparison registers and<br>
the bytes Sn of the serial numbers; this means that there<br>
is at least one transponder 1 whose byte Sn is less than<br>
the contents of address Hn, at least one transponder 1<br>
whose byte Sn is equal to the contents of address Hn, and<br>
at least one transponder 1 whose byte Sn is greater than<br>
the contents of address Hn;<br>
the second situation corresponds to the analysis<br>
apparatus 3 receiving the signal 100, i.e. binary value 1<br>
in the first time window only of the group Gn under<br>
consideration; this means that all of the transponders 1<br>
have their bytes Sn less than the value m stored at<br>
address Hn of their respective comparison registers H;<br>
the third situation corresponds to the analysis<br>
apparatus receiving the signal 110, i.e. binary value 1<br>
in each of the first two time windows of the group under<br>
consideration; this means that the byte Sn in each<br>
transponder 1 is either less than or equal to the value<br>
m and that there is no transponder 1 whose byte Sn is<br>
greater than the contents of the address Hn in the<br>
comparison register;<br>
the fourth situation corresponds to receiving the<br>
signal O1l, i.e. binary value 1 in each of the last two<br>
time windows; this means that the byte Sn in each<br>
transponder 1 is either equal to or greater than the<br>
contents of the address Hn of its comparison register H;<br>
the fifth situation corresponds to receiving the<br>
signal 001, i.e. binary value 1 in the last time window<br>
only of the group Gn under consideration; this means that<br>
all of the transponders have a byte Sn greater than the<br>
contents of the address Hn of their comparison registers;<br>
the sixth case corresponds to receiving the signal<br>
101, i.e. binary value 1 in the first and the last time<br>
windows only of the group Gn; this means that some<br>
transponders have a byte Sn less than the contents of the<br>
address Hn and others have the byte Sn greater than the<br>
contents of the address Hn;<br>
the seventh situation corresponds to receiving the<br>
signal 010, i.e. the binary value 1 in the second time<br>
window only of group Gn; this means that all of the<br>
transponders have their respective bytes Sn equal to the<br>
contents of the address Hn; and finally<br>
the eighth and last situation corresponds to<br>
receiving the signal 000, i.e. no binary value 1 in any<br>
of the three time windows of group Gn; this means either<br>
that all of the transponders have been identified, or<br>
that the group under consideration is the group Gq where q<br>
= 1, 2, or 3, and there is no equality between any of the<br>
bytes Sv and Hw where w is an integer in the range 0 to<br>
q-1.<br>
In the following step 27, if no transponder has byte<br>
Sn of its serial number equal to the value m stored at<br>
address Hn of its comparison register H, then the value of<br>
m is changed and the method returns to step 22, as<br>
represented by arrow 28.<br>
The particular new value that is selected for m<br>
depends on the current situation: if all of the<br>
transponders have their respective bytes Sn greater than<br>
the value m, then it is increased; in contrast, if all of<br>
the transponders have their respective bytes Sn less than<br>
the value of m. then, on the contrary, it is decreased.<br>
The value of m is modified without changing the<br>
value of n so that by interval halving a value is<br>
obtained as quickly as possible for which equality is<br>
obtained between the byte Sn and the contents of the<br>
register Hn of at least one transponder, giving a maximum<br>
of eight iterations; if transponders 1 having their byte<br>
Sn greater than the value m are present simultaneously<br>
with transponders having their byte Sn less than the value<br>
m, then attention is paid initially only to those<br>
transponders for which the byte Sn is greater than the<br>
value m, for example, with the other transponders being<br>
dealt with subsequently.<br>
When the analysis apparatus 3 receives binary value<br>
1 in the second time window of the group Gn under<br>
consideration, that means that there is at least one<br>
transponder 1 for which Sn is equal to the value m; under<br>
such circumstances, in a step 30, a read order is sent to<br>
read the serial number of said transponder(s).<br>
This read order is given and index value p which is<br>
taken to be equal to the current value of n .<br>
If p = 0, then only those transponders for which<br>
there is an 8-bit match between the comparison register H<br>
and the serial number S reply, i.e. only those for which<br>
there is a match between S0 and the contents of address<br>
H0.<br>
If p = 1, only those transponders for which there is<br>
a 16-bit match between the comparison register H and the<br>
serial number S reply, i.e. only those for which there is<br>
a match between both S1 and S0 and the contents of<br>
addresses H1 and H0 respectively.<br>
If p = 2, only those transponders for which there is<br>
a 24-bit match between the comparison register H and the<br>
serial number S reply, i.e. only those for which there is<br>
a match between S2, S1, and S0 and the contents of<br>
addresses H2, H1 and H0, respectively.<br>
In step 31, every transponder concerned<br>
simultaneously transmits the four bytes S2, S1, and S0<br>
constituting its serial number S.<br>
If only one transponder 1 is responding, then in<br>
step 33 the analysis apparatus 3 is capable of analyzing<br>
and reading the serial number so as to store it in step<br>
34 and then return to the method to identify the<br>
remaining transponders.<br>
However, if a plurality of transponders 1 reply,<br>
given that their serial numbers are different, then there<br>
is mutual interference which is detected by the analysis<br>
apparatus 3.<br>
Another term is "collision", and in any event it is<br>
necessary to perform comparison on a larger number of<br>
bits and to determine the value of at least one byte of<br>
greater significance in the serial number.<br>
When a plurality of transponders share the same byte<br>
S0, the value of the byte S1 is determined, and where<br>
necessary, i.e. when a plurality of transponders share<br>
serial numbers that match on 16 bits, then the value of<br>
the byte S3 is determined likewise, but that is<br>
exceptional.<br>
To determine the value of byte Sn+1, the method<br>
returns to step 22 after incrementing the value of n by<br>
unity.<br>
Each identified transponder is placed in a listen<br>
mode in which it ceases to transmit the results of<br>
comparisons between its own serial number and the<br>
comparison register H, by loading its register H with its<br>
own serial number.<br>
With reference to Figure 6, there follows a<br>
description of an implementation of the method to<br>
identifying four transponders having the following serial<br>
numbers: 12345678. 12345680, 65432178, 55555578.<br>
The comparison registers of the four transponders<br>
are initially at 00000000, and the method begins by<br>
loading hexadecimal 80 in the least significant byte S0 by<br>
the analysis apparatus 3 transmitting the order to write<br>
the value 80 at address H0 (the contents of the comparison<br>
register is shown on the right of Figure 6).<br>
In response to this write order, the analysis<br>
apparatus receives the signal 110 in group G0 of time<br>
windows associated with byte S0, i.e. at least one of the<br>
four transponders transmits binary value 1 in the time<br>
window extending between instants t11 and t12, which means<br>
that the least significant byte S0 of the serial number of<br>
at least one of the transponders is equal to 80.<br>
The analysis apparatus 3 then transmits a read order<br>
with p = 0, which causes the, or each, transponder whose<br>
least significant byte S0 is equal to the contents of<br>
address H0 of the comparison register to read its own<br>
serial number.<br>
Since only one of the four transponders in the<br>
example described has a serial number that terminates in<br>
hexadecimal value 80, the analysis apparatus 3 can read<br>
the serial number 12345680 transmitted by that<br>
transponder and can store it.<br>
Thereafter, to put that transponder into standby<br>
mode, the analysis apparatus 3 sends in succession orders<br>
to write the value 56 at address H1 of the comparison<br>
register, the value 34 at address H2 of the comparison<br>
register, and the value 12 in the most significant byte H3<br>
of the comparison register.<br>
Once this transponder has been put on standby, there<br>
still remain three transponders to be identified, i.e.<br>
the transponders having the following serial numbers:<br>
12345678, 65432178, and 55555578.<br>
Because it has received binary value 1 in the time<br>
window extending between instants t12 and t13, the analysis<br>
apparatus 3 knows that all of the remaining transponders<br>
have byte S0 less than the hexadecimal value 80 contained<br>
at address H0 of the comparison register.<br>
Consequently, it decreases the contents at address<br>
H0, and takes 40 as the new value for comparison purposes,<br>
i.e. it takes half the hexadecimal value 80.<br>
The analysis apparatus 3 then sends the order to<br>
write hexadecimal value 40 at address H0, to which the<br>
transponders respond by transmitting the signal 001 in<br>
time window group G0, i.e. binary value 1 in the time<br>
window that extends between instants t12 and t13, since<br>
every one of them has a byte S0 that is greater than 40.<br>
The analysis apparatus 3 then again changes the<br>
contents of address H0 of the comparison register, each<br>
time to a value that is halfway along a range whose end<br>
values are respectively greater than and less than the<br>
value to be determined.<br>
The analysis apparatus 3 thus sends in succession<br>
orders to write the following hexadecimal values in<br>
address H0 of the comparison register: 60, then 70, and<br>
finally 78.<br>
The analysis apparatus 3 then receives from all<br>
three transponders binary value 1 in the time window<br>
which extends between instants tu and t12.<br>
It can happen, exceptionally, as illustrated in the<br>
example under consideration, that the comparison register<br>
of a transponder finds itself loaded by chance with the<br>
full value of its own serial number during the successive<br>
iterations for identifying the transponders.<br>
Under such circumstances, the transponder in<br>
question transmits binary value 1 in the second time<br>
window of each of the four groups G3, G2, G1, and G0 of the<br>
time windows in order to inform the analysis apparatus 3<br>
that it has a match between each of the bytes of its<br>
comparison register and each of the bytes of its serial<br>
number.<br>
Thereafter, this identified transponder switches to<br>
standby, however the analysis apparatus has been able to<br>
store its serial number which is equal to 12345678 in<br>
this case.<br>
The analysis apparatus 3 sends a read order<br>
requesting transmission from the, or each, transponder<br>
which has hexadecimal value 78 for the last byte S0 of its<br>
serial number.<br>
In the example described, the two transponders that<br>
have not been identified both reply simultaneously, and<br>
since their serial numbers are different, there is<br>
interference between the information they transmit.<br>
The analysis apparatus 3 is therefore incapable of<br>
reading the serial numbers and it deduces that there must<br>
be at least two transponders having a serial number that<br>
terminates in hexadecimal value 78.<br>
In order to identify those transponders it is<br>
necessary to perform comparison on the next most<br>
significant byte S1 of the serial numbers.<br>
The analysis apparatus 3 thus begins a new<br>
identification process, modifying on each occasion the<br>
contents of address H1 while leaving the contents of<br>
address H0 unchanged.<br>
Hexadecimal value 80 is initially loaded into<br>
address H1.<br>
The transponders reply in groups G1 and G0 of time<br>
windows, with the signal received in group G1 being 100<br>
since both remaining transponders have respective bytes S1<br>
that are less than hexadecimal value 80.<br>
Thereafter, the analysis apparatus 3 halves the<br>
contents of address H1 of the comparison register, thereby<br>
causing binary value 1 to be sent in each of the time<br>
windows that extend between instants t7 and t8, and t9 and<br>
t10, since of the two remaining transponders, one has its<br>
byte S1 less than hexadecimal value 40, and the other has<br>
its byte S1 greater than hexadecimal value 40.<br>
Initially, analysis apparatus 3 searches only for<br>
the transponder whose byte S1 is greater than hexadecimal<br>
value 40, and this value is changed by successive range<br>
halving until hexadecimal value 55 is reached, thereby<br>
causing binary value 1 to be transmitted in the time<br>
window that extends between instants t8 and t9.<br>
The analysis apparatus 3 then sends a read order<br>
with p = 1 for the attention of the transponder for which<br>
there is a 16-bit match between the contents of the<br>
comparison register and its serial number, i.e. the<br>
transponder whose serial number is 55555578.<br>
The analysis apparatus 3 receives this serial number<br>
and thereafter loads hexadecimal value 55 at addresses H2<br>
and H3 of the comparison register so as to put this<br>
transponder into standby mode.<br>
The analysis apparatus 3 has stored the fact that<br>
there exists a plurality of transponders having a serial<br>
number in which the least significant byte has<br>
hexadecimal value 78, and it has also identified one of<br>
them by making comparisons on the byte S1 of the next<br>
higher significance, so it now sends a new read order to<br>
cause the remaining transponder(s) having byte S0 equal to<br>
hexadecimal value 78 to transmit its or their serial<br>
number(s).<br>
In the example under consideration, there is only<br>
one remaining transponder, the transponder whose serial<br>
number is 65432178.<br>
The analysis apparatus 3 thereafter loads this<br>
serial number into the comparison register, thereby<br>
putting that transponder on standby.<br>
The person skilled in the art will have observed on<br>
reading the above that each transponder is identified<br>
while using a relatively small number of iterations, thus<br>
making it possible to identify a large number of<br>
transponders quickly, with each transponder being<br>
identified in 250 ms on average, for example.<br>
In the example described with reference to Figure 6,<br>
the contents of the comparison register is never<br>
reinitialized to 00000000.<br>
In a variant that is not shown, each transponder<br>
transmits only in the time window Gn corresponding to the<br>
significance n of the byte most recently loaded into the<br>
comparison register, and the comparison register is<br>
reinitialized to 00000000 each time the serial number of<br>
a transponder has been determined.<br>
There follows a description, with reference to<br>
Figure 7 of a second implementation of the invention.<br>
It is assumed that four transponders la, lb, lc, and<br>
Id having respective identity codes 12345678, 12345680,<br>
65432178, and 10345680 are placed in the field of an<br>
analysis apparatus 3.<br>
The transponders la to Id have a comparison register<br>
H identical to that of the transponders described above.<br>
The transponders la to Id are organized to transmit<br>
the result of a comparison between the binary word Hn<br>
placed most recently in the comparison register H and the<br>
word Sn of corresponding weight in the serial number S, in<br>
one of three time windows of a group Gc of three time<br>
windows corresponding respectively to the cases where the<br>
result of the comparison is less than, equal to, or<br>
greater than, said time windows extending respectively<br>
between instants t1 and t2, t2 and t3, and t3 and t4. Each<br>
transponder la to 1d transmits the result of a comparison<br>
relating to a byte Sn of its serial number only if all<br>
the bytes Sm of smaller weight in the serial number for m<br>
lying in the range 0 to n-1 are respectively equal to the<br>
corresponding bytes Hm of the comparison register.<br>
The transponders la to Id are also organized to<br>
transmit in a fourth time window Ge extending between<br>
instants t4 and t5 when the serial number is equal to the<br>
contents of the comparison register. In the event of<br>
such a match, the transponder that has just transmitted<br>
in this fourth time window puts itself into a standby<br>
mode for the remainder of the identification method.<br>
In this case, the analysis apparatus 3 is suitable<br>
for analyzing the responses of as-yet unidentified<br>
transponders in the four above-mentioned time windows,<br>
i.e. the three time windows of the set Gc corresponding<br>
to the results of the comparisons performed by the as-yet<br>
unidentified transponders between the identity data most<br>
recently stored in their transponders and the<br>
corresponding portions of their respective identity codes<br>
as determined by the address selected by the analysis<br>
apparatus; and in the fourth time window Ge corresponding<br>
to the fact that the identity code of a transponder<br>
matches the entire identity data stored by said<br>
transponder in the various selected addresses.<br>
In the method described with reference to Figure 7,<br>
in general:<br>
a) a byte of given significance Hn of the comparison<br>
register H of every unidentified transponder is loaded<br>
with a value m by the analysis apparatus 3 transmitting<br>
an order to write said value m in said byte Hn;<br>
b) said byte of given significance Hn is compared<br>
within each unidentified transponder with the byte Sn of<br>
corresponding significance in its serial number S;<br>
c) depending on the result of the comparison,<br>
greater than, equal to, or less than, each unidentified<br>
transponder transmits a response respectively in the<br>
above-mentioned first, second, or third time window,<br>
providing the serial number bytes of significance smaller<br>
than the byte on which a comparison is actually being<br>
performed are all equal to the corresponding bytes of the<br>
comparison register;<br>
d) within each unidentified transponder, the<br>
comparison register is compared with the serial number<br>
and if they match, the transponder transmits in said<br>
fourth time window and then after transmitting in said<br>
fourth time window, the transponder is put into a standby<br>
mode;<br>
e) the analysis apparatus 3 analyzes the responses;<br>
and<br>
f) in the event of a transmitter transmitting in<br>
said fourth time window, its serial number is determined<br>
as a function of the data that has been stored in the<br>
comparison register of that transponder;<br>
g) in the event of none of the responses<br>
corresponding to a match between the byte of the most-<br>
recently given significance loaded into the comparison<br>
register and the byte of corresponding significance of<br>
the serial number, the method starts again at above step<br>
a) after modifying the value m previously loaded into the<br>
comparison register at the same address Hn so as to reach,<br>
by a range-halving technique, the situation in which the<br>
analysis apparatus 3 detects a response corresponding to<br>
the fact that the value of the byte Hn of given weight in<br>
the comparison register matches the byte Sn of<br>
corresponding weight in the serial number of at least one<br>
transponder;<br>
h) if there is a response corresponding to the fact<br>
that there is a match between the byte Hn of given weight<br>
in the comparison register H and the byte Sn of<br>
corresponding weight of the serial number, the analysis<br>
apparatus 3 sends a read order causing every transponder<br>
in which said match has occurred to transmit its serial<br>
number;<br>
i) in the event of it being impossible to read the<br>
serial numbers transmitted by the transponders in step h)<br>
because of interference, the byte Hn+1 of the comparison<br>
register having the next greater significance is loaded<br>
with a given value m and said value is modified, where<br>
necessary, by a range-halving technique so as to obtain,<br>
on analyzing the responses delivered by the transponders,<br>
a response corresponding to the fact that there is a<br>
match between the value of the byte of given significance<br>
most recently loaded into the comparison register and the<br>
corresponding portion of the serial number in at least<br>
one transponder, in which case a read order is<br>
transmitted causing every transponder for which said<br>
match occurs to transmit its serial number;<br>
j) when it is possible to read a serial number<br>
because only one transponder is responding, said serial<br>
number is stored and then the comparison registers of<br>
said transponder is loaded with this serial number so as<br>
to put it in standby mode; and<br>
k) in the event of it being impossible to read the<br>
serial numbers transmitted by the transponders because of<br>
interference, the method starts again at step i).<br>
More particularly, the method begins by loading byte<br>
H0 of the comparison registers of all four transponders in<br>
Figure 7 with hexadecimal value 80.<br>
The transponders la and lc whose corresponding<br>
serial number byte is 78 transmit in the time window<br>
lying between instants t1 and t2 to inform the analysis<br>
apparatus that the value of the corresponding byte S0 of<br>
their serial numbers is less than 80.<br>
The transponders lb and Id transmit in the time<br>
window that extends between instants t2 and t3 to inform<br>
the analysis apparatus 3 that the value of the<br>
corresponding byte in their serial numbers is 80.<br>
Thereafter the analysis apparatus asks the<br>
transponders that have replied in the second time window<br>
to transmit their serial numbers. Specifically, the<br>
transponders lb and Id transmit simultaneously so there<br>
is a collision, and the analysis apparatus 3 detects the<br>
collision.<br>
The analysis apparatus 3 then loads hexadecimal<br>
value 80 into the byte having the next greater<br>
significance of the comparison register, i.e. byte H1.<br>
The transponders lb and Id then reply in the first<br>
time window.<br>
The analysis apparatus 3 then transmits again so as<br>
to modify the value of byte H1 in the comparison register,<br>
changing it to 40.<br>
This time, the transponders lb and Id transmit in<br>
the third time window since the values of the<br>
corresponding bytes S1 of their respective serial numbers<br>
are all greater than 40.<br>
The analysis device 3 proceeds by a range-halving<br>
technique and after a few iterations loads hexadecimal<br>
value 56 into byte H1.<br>
The transponders lb and Id then reply in the second<br>
time window.<br>
The analysis apparatus 3 again requests all of the<br>
transponders that have replied in the second time window<br>
to transmit their respective serial numbers.<br>
The transponders lb and Id still reply<br>
simultaneously, thereby giving rise to a collision which<br>
is detected by the analysis apparatus 3.<br>
The analysis apparatus then loads hexadecimal value<br>
80 into the next most significant byte of the comparison<br>
register, i.e. H2.<br>
The transponders lb and 1d respond in the first time<br>
window. The analysis apparatus 3 then halves the value<br>
in byte H2, so that it becomes 40. The transponders lb<br>
and Id respond again in the first time window.<br>
After a few iterations, not shown, the value of the<br>
byte H2 is hexadecimal 34, and the transponders lb and 1d<br>
reply in the second time window.<br>
The analysis apparatus 3 again requests the<br>
transponders that have responded in the second time<br>
window to transmit their identity codes. The<br>
transponders lb and 1d respond simultaneously, giving<br>
rise yet again to a collision which is detected by the<br>
analysis apparatus 3. This apparatus then loads the<br>
value 80 into byte H3 of the comparison register and<br>
after a certain number of iterations, as shown in<br>
Figure 7, the value of register H3 becomes, equal to 10.<br>
Only the transponder Id then transmits in the second time<br>
window, and since the contents of its comparison register<br>
then is equal to its serial number, this transponder Id<br>
also transmits in the fourth time window. The analysis<br>
apparatus detects this transmission and stores the<br>
content of the comparison register. The transponder Id<br>
which has just transmitted in the fourth time window puts<br>
itself into standby mode.<br>
The analysis apparatus 3 then requests the other<br>
transponders that have previously responded to the order<br>
to transmit their respective serial numbers to transmit<br>
again. This request is made by sending an order to the<br>
transponders requiring them to transmit their serial<br>
numbers if the value of byte H3 (i.e. the byte of<br>
significance next smaller than that which the most recent<br>
comparison register modifications applied) is equal to<br>
the corresponding byte S2 of their serial numbers.<br>
In this case, only transponder lb transmits its<br>
serial number, having its byte S3 equal to 12.<br>
The analysis apparatus then loads the value 12 into<br>
byte H3 of the comparison, register to put transponder lb<br>
into standby mode.<br>
Thereafter, the analysis apparatus 3 takes up the<br>
identification method by modifying the value of byte H0 in<br>
the comparison register and by range halving this value<br>
ends up by being equal to 78.<br>
The transponder lc then responds in the second and<br>
fourth time windows and then puts itself into standby<br>
mode.<br>
The analysis apparatus 3 then requests all of the<br>
other transponders that responded in the second time<br>
window to send their identity numbers.<br>
Only the transponder lc responds, thereby enabling<br>
it to be identified. Thereafter, the analysis apparatus<br>
loads the comparison register with the serial number of<br>
said transponder so as to put it into standby mode as<br>
well .<br>
Finally, when the analysis apparatus seeks to<br>
continue the identification method and loads a new value,<br>
specifically 22 into byte H0, no transponder responds,<br>
meaning that all of the transponders have been<br>
identified, and have been put into standby mode.<br>
The data transmitted by the transponders is<br>
preferably preceded and followed by a synchronization<br>
signal.<br>
It is possible initially, before the identification<br>
method has been implemented, that not all of the<br>
transponders are reached simultaneously by the field of<br>
the antenna 2 when the apparatus 3 is activated, or that<br>
the smoothing capacitors they contain do not all have the<br>
same charging time, in which case they will not all be<br>
activated simultaneously.<br>
This means that the transponders will not all<br>
respond synchronously, such that the signals transmitted<br>
by the transponders interfere so that the analysis<br>
apparatus cannot read them.<br>
That is why, in the event of interference,<br>
transmission from the analysis apparatus is interrupted<br>
for a given length of time, and then transmission is<br>
restarted, so that all of the transponders are<br>
synchronized when transmission is restarted.<br>
If in spite of that there continues to be<br>
interference, then there is an anomaly, and the analysis<br>
apparatus 3 gives a warning.<br>
Naturally, the invention is not restricted to the<br>
implementations described above.<br>
In particular, in the implementations described, the<br>
comparison register has four bytes, but in a variant that<br>
is not shown, it could have a greater or smaller number<br>
of binary words each of which could have a greater or<br>
smaller number of bits.<br>
Once the serial numbers are known, the number of<br>
transponders present in the field of the antenna 2 is<br>
also known, and it is possible to address each of them<br>
individually.<br>
To address a transponder individually, it suffices<br>
to load the comparison register with its serial number<br>
and then send a special instruction instructing the<br>
transponder whose serial number is equal to the contents<br>
of the comparison register to enter into communication<br>
with the analysis apparatus 3 for the purpose of reading<br>
or writing information in its own memory 13.<br>
Although the invention has been described by making<br>
comparisons initially on the least significant byte S0 of<br>
the serial number, and subsequently making comparisons<br>
where necessary on the more significant bytes S1, S2, S3,<br>
it would not go beyond the ambit of the present invention<br>
to start by making comparisons on the most significant<br>
byte S3, and subsequently, and where necessary, making<br>
comparisons on the less significant bytes S2, S1. and S0.<br>
We claim:<br>

analysis apparatus each transponder having a different identity code (S)<br>
in memory and comprising a comparison register (H), wherein the<br>

transponders (1) does not enable a transponder identity code to be<br>
determined, at least in part, causing the apparatus to start again with<br>
data (Hn, m) that has been modified in such a manner that, within a<br>
finite number of iterations, the transponders are caused to transmit data<br>
enabling the identity code of at least one of the transponders to be<br>

bytes of its identity code already determined by the analysis apparatus<br>

6. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein it optionally<br>
comprises the step of:<br>
causing the analysis apparatus (3), whenever the data previously<br>
received thereby makes this possible, to determine previously received<br>
thereby makes this possible, to determine at least a portion of the<br>
identity code of one or more transponders, to send and order causing<br>
said transponder(s) to transmit its/their identity code(s); and<br>
analyzing said identity code(s) as received to determine whether<br>
only one identity code was transmitted or whether there has been<br>
interference associated with a plurality of different codes being<br>
transmitted, and in the event of only one identity code being received,<br>
storing said code.<br>
7. A method according to the preceding claim, wherein when a plurality<br>
of transponders transmit a plurality of different identity codes<br>
simultaneously and they interfere with one another, the method<br>
optionally comprises the step consisting in sending new data to be<br>
compared with a new portion of the identity code in said transponders,<br>
other than the portion (So) already determined by the analysis apparatus,<br>
optionally in modifying said new data until said new identity code portion<br>
(S1) has been determined, and thereafter in causing the transponder(s)<br>
for which the new identity code portion has been determined to transmit<br>
its/their identity code(s), and in the event of interference restarting the<br>
process for determining the identity code again by causing the<br>
comparison to be performed on an as-yet undetermined portion of the<br>
identity code, until only one identity code is received from the<br>
transponders.<br>
8. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein each identified<br>
transponder is put into a standby mode in which it ceases to transmit<br>
the result of comparing its own identity code (S) with the data (Hn, m)<br>
transmitted by the analysis apparatus.<br>
9. A method according to the preceding claim, wherein each transponder<br>
that has been identified is put into said standby mode by using the<br>
analysis apparatus to transmit the identity code of the transponder.<br>
10. A method according to claim 2, wherein each transponder whose<br>
comparison register is equal to its identity code puts itself into a standby<br>
mode.<br>
11. A method of identifying the serial number (S) of all the transponders<br>
(1) in a plurality of transponders (1) as claimed in, claim 1, the<br>
comparison register (H) of each transponder being capable of storing a<br>
plurality of bytes, preferably four bytes, wherein;<br>
in step (a), a byte (Hn) of given significance of the comparison<br>
register (H) in all of the unidentified transponders is loaded with a value<br>
(m) by causing the analysis apparatus (3) to send an order to write said<br>
value (m) in said byte (Hn);<br>
in step(b), within each transponder (1) said byte of given<br>
significance (Hn) is compared with the byte (Sn) of corresponding<br>
significance in its serial number (S);<br>
in step(c), for this byte of given significance (Hn) of the comparison<br>
register, and depending on the result of the comparison, greater than, or<br>
equal to, or less than, every as-yet unidentified transponder transmits a<br>
response respectively in a first, a second, or a third time window of a<br>
group (Gn) of three time windows associated with the significance (n) of<br>
the byte on which the comparison has been performed, said group being<br>
selected from a plurality of time window groups (G1, G2, G1, G0)<br>
respectively associated with bytes of different significance (n) of the<br>
comparison register, each as-yet unidentified transponder transmitting<br>
the result of comparing the byte of given significance (Hn) most recently<br>
loaded into the comparison register with the corresponding byte of its<br>
serial number, with the proviso, when the byte of given significance on<br>
which comparison is being performed is not the least significant byte,<br>
respectively the most significant, that there is a match between the less<br>
significant bytes, respectively the more significant, of the comparison<br>
register and the corresponding bytes of the serial number;<br>
in step (d), the analysis apparatus (3) is caused to analyze the<br>
responses, and:<br>
when none of the responses corresponding to a match between the<br>
byte of given significance most recently loaded into the comparison<br>
register and the byte of corresponding significance in the serial number,<br>
the method begins again at above step (a) by modifying the value (n)<br>
previously loaded into the comparison register at the same address (Hn)<br>
by a range-halving technique so as to reach a situation in which the<br>
analysis apparatus (3) detects a response corresponding to the fact that<br>
the value of the byte (Hn) of given significance in the comparison register<br>
matches the byte (Sn) of corresponding significance in the serial number;<br>
if one of the responses corresponds to the fact that there is a<br>
match between the byte (Hn) of given significance in the comparison<br>
register (H) and the byte (Sn) of corresponding significance in the serial<br>
number, the analysis apparatus (3) is caused to send a read order<br>
causing every transponder for which a match has occurred to send its<br>
serial number (S);<br>
in the event of it being impossible to read the serial numbers<br>
transmitted by the transponders (1) because of mutual interference, a<br>
given value (m) is loaded into the next most, respectively least, significant<br><br>
byte (Hn+1) of the comparison register, and said value is modified by a<br>
range-halving technique until analysis of he responses from the<br>
transponders indicates a match with the corresponding byte (Sn+1) of the<br>
serial number; and<br>
when a serial number can be read because only one transponder is<br>
responding, said serial number is stored.<br>
12. A method as claimed in claim 11, wherein said steps (c) and (d) are<br>
replaced by the following steps:<br>
(c) depending on the result of the comparison, greater than, equal<br>
to, or less than, each unidentified transponder transmits a response<br>
respectively in a first, a second, or a third time window, providing the<br>
serial number bytes of significance smaller, respectively higher, than the<br>
byte on which a comparison is actually being performed are all equal to<br>
the corresponding bytes of the comparison register;<br>
(d) within each unidentified transponder, the comparison register<br>
is compared with the serial number and if they match, the transponder<br>
transmit in a fourth time window and then after transmitting in said<br>
fourth time window, the transponder is put into a standby mode;<br>
(e) the analysis apparatus (3) analyzes the responses; and<br>
(f) in the event of a transmitter transmitting in said fourth time<br>
window, its serial number is determined as a function of the data that<br>
has been stored in the comparison register of that transponder;<br>
(g) in the event of none of the responses corresponding to a match<br>
between the byte of the most-recently given significance loaded into the<br>
comparison register and the byte of corresponding significance of the<br>
serial number, the method starts again at above step (a) after modifying<br>
the value (m) previously loaded into the comparison register at the same<br>
address (Hn) so as to reach, by a range-halving technique, the situation<br>
in which the analysis apparatus (3) detects a response corresponding to<br>
the fact that the value of the byte (Hn) of given weight in the comparison<br>
register matches the byte (Sn) of corresponding weight in the serial<br>
number of at least one transponder;<br>
(h) If there is a response corresponding to the fact that there is a<br>
match between the byte (Hn) of given weight in the comparison register<br>
(H) and the byte (Sn) of corresponding weight of the serial number, the<br>
analysis apparatus (3) sends a read order causing every transponder in<br>
which said match has occurred to transmit its serial number;<br>
(i) in the event of it being impossible to read the serial numbers<br>
transmitted by the transponders (1) in step (h) because of interference,<br>
the byte (Hn+1) of the comparison register having the next greater,<br>
respectively smaller, significance is loaded with a given value (m), and<br>
said value is modified, where necessary, by a range-halving technique so<br>
as to obtain, on analyzing the responses delivered by the transponders, a<br>
response corresponding to the fact that there is a match between the<br>
value of the byte of given significance most recently loaded into the<br>
comparison register and the corresponding portion of the serial number<br>
in at least one transponder, in which case a read order is transmitted<br>
causing every transponder for which there is a match to transmit its<br>
serial number;<br>
(j) when it is possible to read a serial number because only one<br>
transponder is responding, said serial number is stored and then the<br>
comparison registers of all the transponders are loaded with this serial<br>
number so as to put the transponder which responded in standby mode;<br>
and<br>
(k) in the event of it being impossible to read the serial numbers<br>
transmitted by the transponders because of interference, the method<br>
starts again at step (i).<br>

different identity code. The analysis apparatus (3)<br>
transmits data.  Each as-yet unidentified transponder (1)<br>
compares this data with a portion of its own identity<br>
code, which portion is selected by the analysis<br>
apparatus, and then transmits in a time window that is<br>
selected at least as a function of the result of the<br>
comparison. The analysis apparatus (3) receives the data<br>
transmitted by the transponders (1), and when said data<br>
does not enable any of the identity codes thereof to be<br>
determined, even in part, it emits modified data so that<br>
after a finite number of iterations it causes each of the<br>
transponders to transmit data enabling its identity code<br>
to be determined.</td>
