				<td>MULTI-LAYER    FLOOR    COVERING    STRUCTURE    AND    METHOD    OF MANUFACTURE THEREOF<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a carpet with a novel structure and to a method for the manufacture thereof The present invention also relates to an adhesive composition for use as an intermediate layer in a carpet structure of the invention. Background of the invention<br>
Floor coverings such as carpets are manufactured through a series of separate processes that are typically carried out on separate manufacturing lines For example, a first line is used to produce a carpet material that is formed either by weaving textile yams to form a woven layer or by attaching tufts of textile material to a woven primary backing. In either case, a thin polymeric locking layer is coated to the backside. The output of this process is an unbacked or unfinished carpet material, which is then wound into a roll and transferred to a second processing line. In the second processing line, a layer of vinyl material is added to the back of the carpet to fill the voids in and between the fibers and to provide a uniform surface for attachment of a backing layer. This vinyl layer is typically formed by applying an uncured layer of vinyl on a belt, pressing the unbacked carpet material onto the vinyl sheet and passing the assembly through an oven to cure the vinyl layer in place. Once the vinyl layer has been cured, the carpet/vinyl is separated from the belt and again wound into a roll for transfer to a third processing line where a backing layer is adhered to the vinyl layer.<br>
This typical manufacturing process is highly inefficient in that it requires a separate process line for the vinyl casting process. In addition, the method used to apply the vinyl layer requires the use of a relatively thick layer of vinyl. The cost of virgin vinyl is such that a reduction in the thickness of this layer would result in a significant overall cost reduction for the final product.<br>
Another problem of most prior art carpets is that the level of adhesion is not sufficient to ensure that the backing layer does not separate from the carpet layer itself. It is another significant disadvantage that the carpets in question do not also possess strength to resist wear and tear.<br>
US Patent 6406574 discloses a method for manufacturing a vinyl-backed carpet is described wherein the carpet is assembled in a single continuous finishing line. The method includes the application of a vinyl plastisol reinforcing layer directly to the back of unfinished woven or tufted carpet material. The method allows the use of a thinner vinyl layer that results in savings hi material, processing steps, and energy required for curing. However, the<br>
strength of the carpet is not good. The method is also not applicable for small scale hand loom manufacturing of carpets.<br>
US Patent 6299961 discloses recyclable textile floor coverings for motor vehicles with a multi-layer structure and processes for their preparation. In particular, recyclable textile floor coverings for motor vehicles with a multi-layer structure include a foam layer, a separation layer, a heavy layer, and a textile carpet, wherein the adhesiveness of the separation layer with respect to the heavy layer is different than the adhesiveness of the separation layer with respect to the foam layer. In another embodiment, the separation layer is separably bonded to the heavy layer by spot bonding and/or is separably bonded to the foam layer by spot bonding. The separation layer allows separate recycling of the foam layer on one hand and the textile carpet including the heavy layer on the other hand. However, in this case, the use of several different layers does not contribute to the strength of the carpet.<br>
It is therefore important to devise carpet structures which while being multi-layered are also strong and do not require expensive equipment for manufacture. Objects of the invention<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a carpet structure which is strong, resilient, possesses dimensional stability and provides good cushioning effect over a period of time.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a carpet structure with good sound deadening capability.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide a method for the manufacture of the carpet structure of the invention which is inexpensive and does not require substantial equipment change and is applicable across both automated and manual carpet manufacture.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide a adhesive composition which enables strong adhesion between the carpet layer and the backing and acts as an intermediate layer with good resilience and adhesive strength. Summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a carpet structure which comprises a carpet layer, an intermediate layer of an adhesive of a predetermined thickness and a backing layer, said adhesive layer comprising a layer with intermediate pockets provided therein which act as sound dampeners and air cushions.<br>

In another embodiment of the invention, the aromatic hydrocarbon comprises toluene.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the synthetic resin comprises phenol formaldehdye resin.<br>
The invention also relates to a method for the manufacture of a carpet structure comprising carpet layer, an intermediate layer of an adhesive of a predetermined thickness and a backing layer, said adhesive layer comprising a layer with intermediate pockets provided therein which act as sound dampeners and air cushions, said method comprising forming a carpet layer in the form of a raw carpet from cotton/woolen/acrylic, coating said carpet layer with a primary adhesive paste to form an intermediate adhesive layer with air pockets provided therein, applying a secondary backing layer to intermediate layer.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the primary adhesive paste is applied mechanically or manually.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the air pockets are formed by a voids mesh is pasted with the carpet by applying the pressure on it and curing done at appropriate temperature and at low humidity.<br>
The present invention also relates to an adhesive composition for the use in creation of a adhesive layer for carpets, said composition comprising, Neoprene, Aromatic hydrocarbon, and a Synthetic Resin and optionally a pigment.<br>
The composition comprises neoprene in an amount of 8 to 12 % by weight, the aromatic hydrocarbon in an amount of 88 to 80 % by weight and phenolic resin in an amount of 4 to 8 % by weight.<br>
