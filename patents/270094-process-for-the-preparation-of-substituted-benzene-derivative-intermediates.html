Preference is given also to compounds of formula I wherein R1. R2 and R3 are, each independently of the others, hydrogen, halogen, C1-C6alkyl, C1-C4haloalkyl, C2-C4alkenyl, C2-C4haloalkenyl, C2-C4alkynyl, C3-C6cycloalkyl, C1-C4alkylcarbonyl, C1-C6alkoxycarbonyl, hydroxy, C1-C4alkoxy, C3- or C4-alkenyloxy, C3- or C4-alkynyloxy, C1-C4haloalkoxy, nitro or amino.<br>
Preference is given also to compounds of formula I wherein R1, R2 and R3 are C1-C4alkyl and X is halogen.<br>
Likewise preferred are compounds of formula I wherein n is 0.<br>
Of those, special preference is given to compounds of formula I wherein R1 and R3 are C2-C4alkyl, R2 is C1-C3alkyl, and X is Cl or Br. Especially preferred compounds of formula are those wherein R1 and R3 are ethyl or propyl, R2 is methyl or ethyl, and X is chloro or bromo. Even more especially preferred compounds of formula I are those wherein n is 0, R1 and R3 are ethyl, R2 is methyl, and X is chloro or bromo.<br>
Preparation of substituted benzenes according to formula I by classical Sandmeyer reactions are known in the art. For example, WO00078712 describes a classical Sandmeyer reaction for the production of 1-bromo-2,6-diethyl-4-methylbenzene.<br>
It has now been found, surprisingly, that a variation of the classical Sandmeyer reaction, wherein gaseous or aqueous acid is employed in non-aqueous Sandmeyer conditions, produces 1 -halo-2,6-diethyl-4-methylbenzene in greater yields. More particularly, in a classic Sandmeyer reaction, the diazonium salt is added into a cuprous halide solution, tending to minimize formation of phenol and hydrocarbon coupling reactions. In most cases, the reaction takes place at 0-20°C and requires the use of a molar amount of<br>
cuprous halide to promote the pyrolysis of diazonium salt. In the process of the present invention, metal halide or onium halide is used in the reaction to provide a source of additional solubilized halide ion, further minimizing the phenol formation. Additionally, in case of aqueous acid being employed, water removal by azeotropic distillation helps to minimize the phenol formation, thus improving yields. The diazonium salt is generated in situ, i.e., the diazotization and pyrolysis are carried out simultaneously at elevated temperatures, and the reaction proceeds without the use of copper.<br>
The present process is distinguished by:<br>
a)	use of gaseous or aqueous acid in non-aqueous Sandmeyer reactions;<br>
b)	use of metal halide or onium halide in the reaction to provide a source of additional<br>
solubilized halide ion, further minimizing the phenol formation;<br>
c)	in case that aqueous acid is used, water removal by azeotropic distillation helps to<br>
minimize phenol formation, thus improving yield of the substituted benzene product;<br>
d)	in situ formation of the diazonium salt by simultaneous diazotization and pyrolysis at<br>
elevated temperatures;<br>
e)	absence of copper reagents necessary for classical Sandmeyer reactions;<br>
f)	reduced phenol by-products make it possible to purify the substituted benzene<br>
products by vacuum distillation;<br>
g)	ability to recover and recycle process chemicals such as solvent and by-product<br>
alcohol in the process.<br>
The present preparation process is therefore suitable especially for the cost-effective, large-scale preparation of substituted benzene derivatives of formula I.<br>
The process according to the invention for the preparation of compounds of formula I comprises reacting a compound of formula II<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R0, R1, R2, R3 and n are as defined for formula 1, with aqueous acid in non-aqueous Sandmeyer reactions in the absence of copper. Water removal by azeotropic distillation minimizes the phenol formation and therefore improves the yield of the compound of formula I.   Alternatively, gaseous acid can be used to replace aqueous acid in the reactions. Consequently, a step of water removal by azeotropic distillation can be eliminated.<br>
The preparation of compounds of formula I is illustrated in the following Reaction Scheme 1.<br>
Reaction Scheme 1 <br>
1) HX / organic solvent<br>
2) organic nitrite / elevated 1.<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br><br><br>
According to Reaction Scheme 1, the compounds of formula I are obtained from the aniline compounds of formula II by reacting the aniline compounds of formula II, in a first reaction step, with aqueous HX acid in a suitable organic solvent to form the aniline • HX salt, followed by water removal via azeotropic distillation. Alternatively, anhydrous aniline • HX salt can be formed directly by the reaction of aniline compound of formula II and gaseous HX acid in a suitable organic solvent. The first step of the process of the present invention may include the addition of a suitable metal halide or onium halides (PTC), to further improve the yield. In the second step of the process of the present invention, addition of an organic nitrite forms the diazonium salt in situ by simultaneously carrying out the diazotization and pyrolysis steps at elevated temperature ranges. Unlike classical Sandmeyer reactions, the process of the present invention proceeds in the absence of copper and produces compounds of formula I in high yield.<br>
Examples of suitable organic solvents for the reaction of compounds of formula II with gaseous or aqueous HX (Step 1 in Reaction Scheme 1) include, for example and not for limitation, dibromomethane, 1,2-dibromoethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, dodecane, heptane,<br>
methylcyclohexane, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, and mesitylene.   o-Dichlorobenzene is a preferred organic solvent.<br>
Examples of suitable metal halides or onium halides useful in Step 1 in Reaction Scheme 1 include, but are not limited to, sodium bromide, potassium bromide, sodium chloride, tetrabutylammonium bromide, tetrabutylphosphonium bromide, and methyltributylammonium chloride.<br>
Examples of suitable organic nitrites useful in Step 2 in Reaction Scheme 1 include, but are not limited to, alkyl nitrites, such as isoamyl nitrite, n-pentyl nitrite, n-butyl nitrite, and t-butyl nitrite.<br>
Reaction conditions proceed at elevated temperatures. In Step 1 of Reaction Scheme 1, the formation of the aniline • HX salt is carried out at reaction temperatures of about 40° to about 55°C, and the reaction thereof with the organic nitrite in the absence of copper or copper reagents (Step 2 in Reaction Scheme 1) is carried out at reaction temperatures of from about 50° to about 55°C. Temperatures during the azeotropic distillation step in Step 1 may reach up to 110°C, preferably about 100°C.<br>
If the starting materials employed are not enantiomerically pure, the compounds of formula I obtained in the above-described process are generally in the form of racemates or diastereoisomeric mixtures which, if desired, can be separated on the basis of their physico-chemical properties according to known methods, such as, for example, fractional crystallisation following salt formation with optically pure bases, acids or metal complexes, or by chromatographic procedures, such as, for example, high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) on acetyl cellulose.<br>
Depending on the substituents R0 to R3, the compounds of formula I may be in the form of geometric and/or optical isomers and isomeric mixtures (atropisomers) or as tautomers and tautomeric mixtures.<br>
The Examples that follow further illustrate the invention without limiting it.<br>
Preparation Examples:<br>
Example P1: Preparation of 1-bromo-2.6-diethyl-4-methylbromobenzene with gaseous<br>
hydrogen bromide<br>
Gaseous hydrogen bromide (1.05 equiv.) is fed into a mixture of 2,6-diethyl-4-methylaniline (1.00 equiv.) and sodium bromide (0.10 equiv.) in o-dichlorobenzene. The resulting salt suspension is cooled to 50°C. Isoamyl nitrite (1.05 equiv.) and additional gaseous hydrogen bromide (0.3 equiv.) are fed subsurface simultaneously at 50-55° C over a 2-hour period to afford 1 -bromo-2,6-diethyl-4-methylbenzene as a yellow to light brown solution. The reaction mass is neutralized with 25% caustic solution (ca. 0.3 equiv.). The bottom aqueous phase is separated off. Isoamyl alcohol and o-dichlorobenzene are sequentially stripped off to produce the crude 2,6-diethyl-4-methylbromobenzene material with an assay of 90% and an isolated yield of 87-90%. The product can be further purified by vacuum distillation at 95°C/5mmHg to give an assay of 97-99%.<br>
Example P2: Preparation of 1-bromo-2.6-diethyl-4-methybenzene with aqueous hydrobromic acid<br>
48% aqueous hydrobromic acid (1.05 equiv.) is fed into a mixture of diethylmethylaniline (1.00 equiv.) and sodium bromide (0.10 equiv.) in o-dichlorobenzene. Water is then azeotroped off under vacuum. The resulting salt suspension is cooled to 50°C. n-Pentyl nitrite (1.05 equiv.) is fed subsurface at 50-55°C over 2-hour period to afford 1-bromo-2,6-diethyl-4-methylbenzene as a yellow to light brown solution. The bottom aqueous phase is separated off. The organic phase is washed with 10% sodium carbonate solution (0.15 equiv.). n-Pentanol and o-dichlorobenzene are sequentially stripped off to produce the crude 1-bromo-2,6-diethyl-4-methylbenzene material with an assay of 90% and an isolated yield of 83-85%. The product can be further purified by vacuum distillation at 95°C/5 mmHg to give an assay of 97-99%.<br>
Example P3: Preparation of 1-chloro-2.6-diethyl-4-methylbenzene with gaseous hydrogen chloride<br>
Gaseous hydrogen chloride (1.05 equiv.) is fed into a solution of 2,6-diethyl-4-methylaniline (1.00 equiv.) in o-dichlorobenzene, allowing the pot temperature to rise to 70°C. The resulting salt suspension is cooled to 45°C. Isoamyl nitrite (1.05 equiv.) and additional gaseous hydrogen chloride (0.50 equiv.) are fed subsurface simultaneously at 45-50°C over a 2-hour period to afford 1-chloro-2,6-diethyl-4-methylbenzene in 90-93% yield. 20% sodium hydroxide (0.50 equiv.) is added to adjust the pH to 10-12. The bottom aqueous phase is separated off. Isoamyl alcohol and o-dichlorobenzene are stripped off to produce the crude 1-chloro-2,6-diethyl-4-methylbenzene material. The product can be further purified by vacuum distillation at 85°C/5 mmHg to give an assay of 97-99%.<br>
Example P4: Preparation of 1-chloro-2.6-diethyl-4-methylbenzene with aqueous hydrogen<br>
chloride<br>
37% aqueous hydrochloric acid can be used to replace gaseous hydrogen chloride in the<br>
process of example P3. An additional step of azeotropic distillation is needed to remove<br>
water after 2,6-diethyl-4-methylaniline • HCI salt formation. A drying agent such as CaC12 or<br>
CaSO4 is optionally added in the diazotization step to achieve good yield.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
