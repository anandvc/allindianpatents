INTER-NETWORK HANDOVER IN A PACKET RADIO SYSTEM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates in general to wireless communication systems,<br>
and more specifically to a method and apparatus for performing handovers across<br>
access networks in a wireless cellular communication system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) system, a handover across Radio<br>
Access Network (RAN) boundaries may be necessary when a communication unit<br>
such as a mobile station (MS), user equipment (UE), user entity (UE) or the like is<br>
moving between RANs. In a conventional inter-RAN handover environment such as<br>
in a second generation Global System for Mobile (GSM) system or the like, an<br>
external or inter-RAN handover typically involves a Mobile Switching Center (MSC)<br>
to support the RAN-to-RAN communications required for the handover.<br>
Conventional, second generation GSM mobile networks, use the MSC to<br>
provide an interface with the public fixed network such as the Public Switched<br>
Telephone Network (PSTN), or the like. From the perspective of the fixed network,<br>
the MSC is just another switching node. From the perspective of the mobile network<br>
however, switching or handover is more complicated since the MSC needs to know<br>
where the MS is currently located and where it may be heading. As is well known to<br>
those of ordinary skill in the art, a GSM system accomplishes location updating and<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/073684                                                                                         PCT/US2005/044856<br>
call routing to the MS by using the Home Location Register (HLR) and the Visitor<br>
Location Register (VLR).<br>
When the MS notices that the location-area broadcast information is different<br>
from that previously stored in the MS memory, by monitoring, for example, the<br>
Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH), an update request and the International Mobile<br>
Subscriber Identity (MSI) or previous Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (TMSI)<br>
is sent to the VLR via the MSC. When a new MSC is encountered, a new Mobile<br>
Station Roaming Number (MSRN) is allocated and sent to the HLR associated with<br>
the MS by the VLR. The MSRN is a regular telephone number which rather than<br>
being assigned to a single user is part of a pool of numbers. The MSRN is used to<br>
route the call to the new MSC and is subsequently translated to the MSI of the<br>
mobile. The HLR sends back the necessary call-control parameters, and also sends a<br>
cancel message to the old VLR, so that the previous MSRN can be reallocated.<br>
Finally, a new TMSI is allocated and sent to the mobile for identification in future<br>
paging or call requests.<br>
Conducting handovers using the MSC can give rise to limitations associated<br>
with, for example, latency. Further, while the MSC, HLR, VLR model was<br>
developed with a circuit switching model in mind, third generation (3G) systems<br>
support high speed packet switching. Moreover, since the MSC is not involved in the<br>
handover activities of packet services in accordance with 3G system associated with,<br>
for example, Universal Mobile Telecommunications Services (UMTS), CDMA 2000<br>
and the like, other solutions are needed to accomplish handover of packet-based calls<br>
or sessions, particularly real time packet-based calls or sessions associated with<br>
providing support for voice and/or multimedia services.<br>

WO 2006/073684                                                                                         PCT/US2005/044856<br>
the inventive principles and advantages thereof, rather than to limit in any manner the<br>
invention. The invention is defined solely by the appended claims including any<br>
amendments made during the pendency of this application and all equivalents of those<br>
claims as issued.<br>
It is understood that the use of relational terms such as first and second, and<br>
the like, if any, are used solely to distinguish one from another entity, item, or action<br>
without necessarily requiring or implying any actual such relationship or order<br>
between such entities, items or actions.<br>
Much of the inventive functionality and many of the inventive principles when<br>
implemented, are best supported with or in software or integrated circuits (ICs), such<br>
as a digital signal processor and corresponding software or application specific ICs. It<br>
is expected that one of ordinary skill, notwithstanding possibly significant effort and<br>
many design choices motivated by, for example, available time, current technology,<br>
and economic considerations, when guided by the concepts and principles disclosed<br>
herein will be readily capable of generating such software instructions or ICs with<br>
minimal experimentation. Therefore, in the interest of brevity and minimization of<br>
any risk of obscuring the principles and concepts according to the present invention,<br>
further discussion of such software and ICs, if any, will be limited to the essentials<br>
with respect to the principles and concepts used by the preferred embodiments.<br>
In addition to devices of a general nature, the communication devices of<br>
particular interest are those providing or facilitating voice/data communications<br>
services over cellular wide area networks (WANs), such as conventional two way<br>
systems and devices, various cellular phone systems including analog and digital<br>
cellular, CDMA (code division multiple access) and variants thereof, GSM, GPRS<br>

WO 2006/073684                                                                                         PCT7US2005/044856<br>
(General Packet Radio Service), 3G systems such as UMTS (Universal Mobile<br>
Telecommunication Service) systems, EDGE (Enhanced Data Rate for GSM)<br>
systems, Internet Protocol (IP) Wireless Wide Area Networks like 802.16, 802.20 or<br>
Flarion, integrated digital enhanced networks and variants or evolutions thereof.<br>
Furthermore the wireless communication units or devices of interest can have short<br>
range wireless communications capability normally referred to as WLAN capabilities,<br>
such as IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth, or Hiper-Lan and the like preferably using CDMA,<br>
frequency hopping, OFDM or TDMA access technologies.<br>
As further discussed herein below, various inventive principles and<br>
combinations thereof are advantageously employed to provide input signal generation<br>
based on device orientation.<br>
In 3G systems such as system 100 shown in FIG. 1, a RAN such as a Base<br>
Station Subsystem/GSM/EDGE Radio Access Network (BSS/GERAN) 110, a<br>
BSS/GERAN 120, and a BSS/GERAN 130 in accordance with various exemplary<br>
embodiments, provide packet-based real time services to a MS 102 such as services<br>
for voice and multimedia. It will be appreciated that the BSS/GERAN 110, the<br>
BSS/GERAN 120, and the BSS/GERAN 130 can interact, as will be described, with a<br>
core network such as an external network 142, which can be a PSTN, an IP based<br>
network, such as the Internet or the like, or a combination of networks, and facilitate<br>
connectivity between the MS 102 through the radio portion of the network and the<br>
RAN for access to and provision of, for example, Internet based services. Each of the<br>
BSS/GERAN 110, the BSS/GERAN 120, and the BSS/GERAN 130 can be<br>
configured with a Base Transceiver Station (BTS) and a Base Station Controller<br>
(BSC) coupled through a bus or other connection as would be appreciated by one of<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/073684                                                                                         PCT/US2005/044856<br>
ordinary skill, such as a BTS 112 and a BSC 114 coupled through a connection 111<br>
for the BSS/GERAN 110, a BTS 122 and a BSC 124 coupled through a connection<br>
121 for the BSS/GERAN 120, and a BTS 132 and a BSC 134 coupled through a<br>
connection 131 for the BSS/GERAN 130.<br>
The MS 102 can establish a connection with, for example, the BTS 112 of the<br>
BSS/GERAN 110 through an air interface link 104 as will be appreciated by one of<br>
ordinary skill. As the MS 102 moves within the exemplary environment, a new link<br>
106 can be established with BTS 122 of the BSS/GERAN 120, and as the MS 102<br>
moves further a new link 108 with BTS 132 of the BSS/GERAN 130 can be<br>
     established in a novel manner to be described in greater detail hereinafter.<br>
In an exemplary configuration, system 100 further includes a Serving GPRS<br>
Support Node (SGSN) 116 serving the BSS/GERAN 110 and the BSS/GERAN 120,<br>
and a SGSN 136 serving the BSS/GERAN 130. The SGSN 116 and the SGSN 136<br>
are coupled to a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) 140 which may provide an<br>
interface to external network 142, such as the public Internet or the like as described<br>
above, other mobile service providers' GPRS services, enterprise intranets, or the like.<br>
The GGSN 140 maintains routing information necessary to tunnel protocol data units<br>
(PDUs) addressed, for example to the MS 102, to the SGSN 116 using GPRS<br>
Tunneling Protocol (GTP) over the interface 118. The SGSN 116 then sends the<br>
information to the BSS/GERAN 110 over the interface 113 in accordance with, for<br>
example, a known Gb interface protocol such as a Gb interface 150, when the MS 102<br>
is in locations associated with the link 104.<br>
When the MS 102 is in a location associated with the link 106, PDUs<br>
addressed to the MS 102 can be tunneled to the SGSN 116 using GTP over the<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/073684                                                                                         PCT/US2005/044856<br>
interface 118. The SGSN 116 then sends the PDUs to the BSS/GERAN 120 over the<br>
interface 123. When the MS 102 is in a location associated with the link 108, PDUs<br>
addressed to the MS 102 can be tunneled to the SGSN 136 using GTP over the<br>
interface 138. The SGSN 136 then sends the PDUs to the BSS/GERAN 130 over the<br>
interface 133. It will be appreciated that the tunneling function of the GGSN 140<br>
includes redirecting inbound packets addressed to the MS 102 according to its original<br>
location, for example in connection with the BSS/GERAN 110. The redirected<br>
packets are transparently forwarded to the MS 102 at its new location or locations, for<br>
example, in connection with the BSS/GERAN 120 or the BSS/GERAN 130 such that<br>
packet originators need not know of the tunneling. The GGSN 140 can further<br>
provide additional "gateway" functions such as network and subscriber screening and<br>
address mapping.<br>
In other third generation (3G) systems such as system 200 shown in FIG. 2, a<br>
RAN such as RAN/Universal Mobile Telecommunications Services (UMTS)<br>
Terrestrial Radio Access Network (RAN/UTRAN) 210, a RAN/UTRAN 220, and a<br>
RAN/UTRAN 230 in accordance with various exemplary embodiments, also provide<br>
packet-based real time services to a User Equipment (UE) 202 such as services for<br>
voice and multimedia. The RAN/UTRAN 210, the RAN/UTRAN 220, and the<br>
RAN/UTRAN 230 can facilitate connectivity between the UE 202 through the radio<br>
portion of the network to Internet based services by facilitating the interaction, as will<br>
be described, with a core network such as external network 242, which can be a<br>
PSTN, an IP based network, such as the Internet or the like, or a combination of<br>
networks. Each of the RAN/UTRAN 210, the RAN/UTRAN 220, and the<br>
RAN/UTRAN 230 can be configured with a Node B transceiver and a Radio Network<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2006/073684                                                                                                   PCT7US2005/044856<br>
Controller (RNC) coupled through a bus or other connection as would be appreciated<br>
by one of ordinary skill, such as a Node B 212 and a RNC 214 coupled through a<br>
connection 211 for the RAN/UTRAN 210, a Node B 222 and a RNC 224 coupled<br>
through a connection 221 for the RAN/UTRAN 220, and a Node B 232 and a RNC<br>
234 coupled through a connection 231 for the RAN/UTRAN 230.<br>
The UE 202 can establish a connection with, for example, the Node B 212 of<br>
the RAN/UTRAN 210 through an air interface link 204 as will be appreciated by one<br>
of ordinary skill. As the UE 202 moves within the exemplary environment, a new<br>
link 206 can be established with the Node B 222 of the RAN/UTRAN 220, and as the<br>
UE 202 moves further, a new link 208 with the Node B 232 of the RAN/UTRAN 230<br>
can be established in a novel manner to be described in greater detail hereinafter.<br>
In an exemplary configuration, system 200 further includes a Serving GPRS<br>
Support Node (SGSN) 216 serving the RAN/UTRAN 210 and the RAN/UTRAN 220,<br>
and a SGSN 236 serving the RAN/UTRAN 230. The SGSN 216 and the SGSN 236<br>
are coupled to a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) 240 which may provide an<br>
interface to an external network 242, such as the public Internet or the like as<br>
described above, other mobile service providers' UMTS services, packet-based<br>
services, enterprise intranets, or the like. As described above with reference to FIG.<br>
1, the GGSN 240 maintains routing information necessary to tunnel protocol data<br>
units (PDUs) addressed, for example to the UE 202, to the SGSN 216 using GPRS<br>
Tunneling Protocol (GTP)) over the interface 218. The SGSN 216 then sends the<br>
information to the RAN/UTRAN 210 over the interface 213 using GTP in accordance<br>
with, for example, an Iu-ps interface 250, where "Iu-ps" is an interface protocol<br>
designator for a packet switched interface which differentiates between the Transport<br>

WO 2006/073684                                                                                         PCT/US2005/044856<br>
Network Layer and the Radio Network Layer as would be appreciated by one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art. It will be appreciated that PDUs are tunneled through the<br>
SGSN 216 and the RAN/UTRAN 210 when the UE 202 is in locations associated<br>
with the link 204. When the UE 202 is in a location associated with the link 206,<br>
     PDUs addressed to the UE 202 can be tunneled to the SGSN 216 using GTP over the<br>
interface 218. The SGSN 216 then sends the PDUs to the RAN/UTRAN 220 over the<br>
interface 223. When the UE 202 is in a location associated with the link 208, PDUs<br>
addressed to the UE 202 can be tunneled to the SGSN 236 using GTP over the<br>
interface 238. The SGSN 236 then sends the PDUs to the RAN/UTRAN 230 over the<br>
     interface 233. The Transport Network Layer is a transport platform, which can be<br>
independent, between the radio portion and the core network, and the Radio Network<br>
Layer handles UMTS specific signaling and user data.<br>
It will be appreciated that the tunneling function of the GGSN 240 includes<br>
redirecting inbound packets addressed to the UE 202 according to its original<br>
     location, for example in connection with the RAN/UTRAN 210. The redirected<br>
packets are transparently forwarded to UE 202 at its new location or locations, for<br>
example, in connection with the RAN/UTRAN 220 or the RAN/UTRAN 230. The<br>
GGSN 240 can further provide additional "gateway" functions such as network and<br>
subscriber screening and address mapping.<br>
               It should be noted that Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN)<br>
technology provides infrastructure allowing the radio portion of the network to<br>

WO 2006/073684                                                                                         PCT/US2005/044856<br>
The UTRAN technology further facilitates connectivity between the UE 202 through<br>
the radio portion of the network, such as the RAN/UTRAN portion, the complex of<br>
GPRS Support Nodes (GSN) and Internet based services.<br>
Accordingly, as shown in FIG. 3, which illustrates an exemplary inter-RAN<br>
handover environment 300 using, for purposes of illustration, a BSS 310 having a<br>
transceiver 312 coupled to a controller 314 through a connection 311 such as a high<br>
speed bus, a modem connection or the like as will be appreciated by those of ordinary<br>
skill, and a BSS 320 having a transceiver 322 coupled to a controller 324 through a<br>
connection 321. The BSS 310 and the BSS 320 can be serviced by a SGSN 340 and a<br>
SGSN 350 respectively. The SGSN 340 and the SGSN 350 are coupled through a<br>
link 313 and a link 323 respectively to the controller 314 and the controller 324<br>
associated with the BSS 310 and the BSS 320 as noted above, and are coupled to a<br>
GGSN 360 through the connections 342 and 352 The GGSN 360 can be used to<br>
provide gateway functions to an external network 380, and can tunnel packets from<br>
the external network 380 to the UE 302 through the SGSN 340 while the UE 302 is<br>
within the range of the BSS 310, and further can tunnel packets to the UE 302 through<br>
the SGSN 350 while the UE 302 is within the range of the BSS 320 after a handover<br>
within the GSN complex in accordance with various exemplary embodiments as will<br>
be described.<br>
As can be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, the GSN complex can<br>
consist of SGSN and the GGSN, and thus a handover using the GSN complex in<br>
accordance with various exemplary embodiments, includes the SGSN 340 and the<br>
GGSN 360 when the UE 302 is within the range of the transceiver 312, and the SGSN<br>
350 and the GGSN 360 when the UE 302 is within the range of the transceiver 322. It<br>

WO 2006/073684                                                                                         PCT/US2005/044856<br>
will be appreciated that a generalized air interface link 304 is shown for all air<br>
interface connections associated with UE 302 and components within the inter-RAN<br>
handover environment 300. In accordance with various exemplary embodiments for<br>
example, for a handover of service of the UE 302 between the BSS 310 and the BSS<br>
320, the SGSN 340 may be given the task of preparing for or initiating the handover.<br>
The SGSN 340 can be configured to take requests on an uplink channel 305 for<br>
opening a communications channel from the BSS 310 to the BSS 320, or from one<br>
RAN to an adjacent RAN, or the like. Information can be passed to UE 302 on<br>
downlink channel 306. It will be appreciated that in accordance with, for example,<br>
conventional circuit switched operation, such as when supporting 2G or 2.5G<br>
operation in a 3G system, the MSC may take an active role in the handover or can be<br>
used to set up the communications, with an exemplary SGSN having the same<br>
options. However, the RAN may be better suited to control the handover and provide<br>
the required support to enable the communications.<br>
Once it becomes apparent that a handover is going to be executed in one of a<br>
variety of manners as will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill, the current RAN<br>
such as the BSS 310 should inform the SGSN 340. Accordingly, when a Gb interface<br>
is used between the RAN and the SGSN, such as the BSS 310 and the SGSN 340, the<br>
SGSN 340 can be configured to set up the Frame Relay Link Layer Identifier (LLI)s<br>
in preparation for the exemplary MS, or the like such as the UE 302, arriving at the<br>
new cell location, such as within range of the BSS 320 and establishing a new uplink<br>
channel 307. If an Iu-ps interface is used, the exemplary SGSN, such as the SGSN<br>
340 must set up the flow IDs for the PDP contexts across the GTP tunnel between it<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/073684                                                                                         PCTAJS2005/044856<br>
and the new RAN, such as the BSS 320, as will be appreciated by one of ordinary<br>
skill in the art.<br>
It will further be appreciated that one or more tunnel identifiers can be<br>
established for a first tunnel, for example, between the second RAN and a service<br>
node. In the event that a new service node is associated with the second RAN, a<br>
second tunnel may also be established between the gateway node and the new service<br>
node.<br>
In accordance with various exemplary embodiments, When the RAN to which<br>
the UE 302 is moving to, such as the BSS 320 is under the service of a different or<br>
"new" SGSN, such as the SGSN 350, the current SGSN, such as the SGSN 340 must<br>
communicate with the SGSN 350, directly or via a GGSN, such as the GGSN 360. If<br>
a handover is to occur, the SGSN 350 has the responsibility to set up the GTP tunnels<br>
and flow IDs for the PDP contexts to the GGSN 360 as well as over Iu-ps interfaces<br>
to the RANs such as the BSS 310 and the BSS 320. Further in accordance with<br>
various exemplary and alternative exemplary embodiments as described, when a Gb<br>
interface is used between an exemplary RAN and an exemplary SGSN, such as during<br>
a handover between RANs, the SGSN serving the RAN to which the communication<br>
unit, such as the MS is moving to can be configured to set up the TLLIs in preparation<br>
for the MS arriving in the serving area of the new RAN.<br>
It should be noted that for an internal, or network initiated handover, data<br>
flows must be properly accommodated, such as in order to avoid interrupting the<br>
session, and to continue to provide the highest possible level of service, Quality of<br>
Service (QoS) or the like consistent with the session parameters. Therefore, in<br>
accordance with various exemplary embodiments, the session can include information<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2006/073684                                                                                         PCT/US2005/044856<br>
with a service category such as a QoS value associated therewith, and packets or the<br>
like associated with the session can be forwarded to the new site the old site, both<br>
sites, or can be held as appropriate based on the service category, QoS value, or the<br>
like. For example, if the service category includes real time data, the packets,<br>
information or the like associated with the session can be forwarded to both sites to<br>
ensure that no information is lost during the handover. If the service category is low,<br>
the information can be forwarded to the new site or held until the handover is<br>
complete. It will be appreciated that uplink data flows may be handled more easily by<br>
allowing uplink data packets which may or may not originate yet from the MS, UE, or<br>
the like, to be accepted from either RAN until it is clear through, for example, a data<br>
packet having a MAC header attributable to the MS, UE, or the like, has originated<br>
from the new RAN.<br>
Downlink data flows require different handling. For example for voice,<br>
multimedia and the like real time data flows, which are not configured for packet<br>
retransmission on error, sending packets to both the current RAN and the new RAN<br>
reduces the probability that packets will be dropped. Other non-real time data flows<br>
may be handled via flow control, for example, by putting the data flow on hold until<br>
the MS, UE, or the like arrives at the new RAN.<br>
With reference to FIG. 4, an exemplary procedure 400 which can be<br>
performed in accordance with various exemplary embodiments will be discussed and<br>
described. It will be appreciated that in accordance with some embodiments, the<br>
procedure can be implemented as a software procedure, for example, in a device, such<br>
as an infrastructure component having a processor and a memory and the ability to<br>
connect to other elements within a wireless communication system, RAN, or the like<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2006/073684                                                                                         PCT/US2005/044856<br>
as has been described hereinabove. After start at 401, the procedure may establish<br>
that a handover between RANs is imminent or in progress, through an indication, for<br>
example, that a MS, UE, CU or the like is within range of the BTS associated with a<br>
new BSS/GERAN, within the range of a Node B transceiver associated with a new<br>
RAN/UTRAN or the like in a manner that will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill<br>
in the art. If it is determined that the Gb interface is used at 403, for example for<br>
communications between the SGSN and the new RAN, the SGSN and new RAN can<br>
set up TLLIs, for example as described above in connection with the GPRS<br>
Temporary Link Layer identifiers, in advance of the actual handover and can inform<br>
the MS, UE, CU, or the like of the new TLLIs using the present RAN at 404. It will<br>
be appreciated that the procedure of informing the MS, UE, CU or the like is not<br>
mandatory, but can be performed based on individual circumstances. Moreover, in<br>
accordance with various exemplary embodiments, regardless of the type of interface<br>
(Gb, Iu-ps) it is sufficient that the first site or RAN be notified simply that the<br>
identifiers are established and not necessarily what the identifiers are, such that the<br>
handover can be initiated.<br>
If the Gb interface is determined not to be in use, then it can be determined<br>
whether the Iu-ps interface is used between the SGSN and the RAN at 405. If so,<br>
then new Flow IDs can be set up for the GTP tunnel between the new RAN and the<br>
SGSN. If the Iu-ps interface is not used, then it can be presumed that there is an error<br>
or the system is not compatible with 3G type systems. After setting up new TLLIs at<br>
404 or new Flow IDs at 407, it can be determined whether the SGSN serving the new<br>
RAN is also new at 408. If so, then new Flow IDs can be set up for the GTP tunnel<br>
between the GGSN and the new SGSN at 409. If the SGSN serving the new RAN is<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2006/073684                                                                                         PCT/US2005/044856<br>
determined at 408 not to be new, then the new RAN can set up Temporary Block<br>
Rows (TBF) for the handover as will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art<br>
at 410. A TBF is a unidirectional "physical" connection between the mobile station<br>
and the RAN. It will be appreciated that in an exemplary TBF, uplink and downlink<br>
resources are separated allowing for asymmetric allocation of uplink and downlink<br>
resources. The TBF is maintained only for the duration of the data transfer.<br>
Further in accordance with various exemplary and alternative exemplary<br>
embodiments, for example, as described hereinabove, the present invention can be<br>
implemented using an exemplary apparatus 500 as shown in FIG. 5. An exemplary<br>
device 501 which can be for example, an apparatus located in a service node such as a<br>
SGSN or the like, includes a processor 510 which can be coupled to a memory 511<br>
using a bus 515 as is well understood. An optional controller 520, or dedicated<br>
processor or the like may also be used to perform specific functions in accordance<br>
with various exemplary embodiments using for example, a controller processor 522<br>
and a controller memory 521. Alternatively, device 501 can be embodied as a<br>
controller or the like without departing from the invention and can include<br>
subcomponents such as processors and/or controllers or the like as described herein.<br>
It will be appreciated that the controller processor 522 may be a general purpose<br>
processor dedicated to performing handover related procedures or can be a dedicated<br>
processor specifically configured to perform handover related tasks. The device 501<br>
may further be configured with a transceiver/RF interface 512 coupled to one or more<br>
antenna or antennae 513 if the device 501 is configured to conduct communications<br>
over a radio frequency interface to a communication unit such as a MS, UE, or the<br>
like, or a base station such as a Node B, or a BTS or the like.<br>
