				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a continuous measurement of liquid steel level in<br>
a movable tundish for feeding liquid metal in a continuous casting mould.<br>
Liquid steel, after tapping from BOF is carried in ladles to the secondary<br>
metallurgical units like basic oxygen furnace (BOF), Online purging (OLP), ladle<br>
furnace (LF) and Rheinstahl-Heraeus (RH) for refinement. Thereafter the ladle is<br>
transferred to casters.<br>
Liquid steel from the ladle is teemed through a refractory shroud into an<br>
intermediate refractory lined container, known as tundish, which in turn feeds<br>
the liquid steel into the continuous casting moulds through submerged entry<br>
nozzles.<br>
The metal level in the tundish is required to be operated, at a healthy position so<br>
that suction of tundish slag into the mould can be minimized. Maintaining the<br>
liquid steel level in the tundish will also maximize inclusion floatation.<br>
Furthermore, the tundish is moved in a vertical plane in order to safeguard the<br>
submerged entry nozzles against the preferential wearing at the interface.<br>
For measuring the level of liquid steel in the tundish, usually load cells are used<br>
which determine the weight of metal in the tundish. Such load cell based<br>
weighing system gives an indirect estimate of the level of liquid steel in the<br>
tundish.<br><br>
The load cell based system of indicating the level of liquid<br>
steel in tundish, however requires regular calibration. Such<br>
calibration procedures are time consuming and requires great deal<br>
of attention.The system also needs regular maintenance.<br>
The main object of the present invention therefore, is to provide<br>
a continuous level control system for measuring with greater<br>
accuracy the liquid level in the tundish without the need for<br>
frequent calibration.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
continuous level control system that is robust in construction<br>
and needs very little maintenance.<br>
These and other objects are achieved by using a distance meter<br>
sensor and a level measurement sensor for measuring the free<br>
metal level in the tundish. The distance meter sensor can be a<br>
laser distance meter manufacured by Leica,Switzerland. For the<br>
level measurement sensor a high temperature ievel measurement<br>
sensor manufactured by Riegl laser measurement system can be<br>
used.<br>
The optical unit in the high temperature level measurement laser<br>
sensor device senses the free metal level in the tundish and<br>
sends the signal to the level sensor electronic circuitry of the<br>
device.<br><br>
The laser distance meter is focussed on the upper surface of the<br>
tundish shell for locating the instantaneous position of the<br>
tundish in the vertical plane.<br>
The above mentioned two sensors generate current signals in<br>
milli-amperes which can be converted to voltage signals with the<br>
help of a signal converter.<br>
The two signals from the two sensors in conjunction dynamically<br>
provide the instantaneous metal level in the tundish. For this,<br>
the voltage signals from the level measurement and distance meter<br>
sensors are processed in a processor with a built in analog to<br>
digital converter. The liquid metal level in the tundish can then<br>
be displayed in a display unit connected to the signal processor.<br>
The invention thus provides a continuous level control system for<br>
measuring the liquid steel level in a tundish, comprising a ladle<br>
with a ladle nozzle shroud, an intermediate container or tundish<br>
for receiving liquid steel from the ladle, said tundish being<br>
provided with a submerged entry nozzle and movable in a vertical<br>
plane through a distance characterized in that said system is<br>
provided with a level measurement sensor for sensing the free<br><br>
metal level in the tundish and generating a signal, a distance<br>
meter sensor for focussing on the upper surface of the tundish to<br>
locate the instantaneous position of the tundish in the vertical<br>
plane, a converter for converting the current signals received<br>
from said level measurement sensor and distance meter sensor into<br>
voltage signals and a processor coupled to said converter for<br>
receiving said voltage signals and calculating therefrom the<br>
level of liquid steel in said tundish.<br>
The invention will now be described in detail with the help of<br>
the accompanying drawings, where :<br>
Figure 1 shows the weight of steel in a tundish as a function<br>
of metal fill height of the tundish,<br>
Figure 2 shows schematically the layout of a continuous casting<br>
facility,<br>
Figure 3 shows in block diagram form the layout of the system<br>
of present invention,<br>
Figure 4 shows schematically the calibration layout of the<br>
present invention.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, in a typical casting facility, liquid steel<br>
from the steel ladle 1 is teemed through a refracting ladle<br>
nozzle shroud 2 into an intermediate container 3. This<br><br>
intermediate container 3 is refractory lined and is known as<br>
tundish. This tundish 3 in turn feeds the liquid steel through a<br>
submerged entry nozzle 4 into the continuous casting moulds S.<br>
The tundish is moved in a vertical plane through distance H for<br>
safeguarding the submerged entry nozzles 4 against wear at the<br>
interface,<br>
The level control system comprises a level measurement laser<br>
sensor 6, as shown in Figure 3. This level measurement laser<br>
sensor 6 is provided with high temperature level sensor<br>
electronics and an optical unit. The electronics may be LD90-3100<br>
HT-GF and the optical unit MK 56 in a Riegl Laser Measurement<br>
Systems, GmbH make laser sensor and their details are not shown<br>
in Figure 3.<br>
The optical unit of the level measurement laser sensor 6 senses<br>
the free metal level in the tundish 3 and sends a signal to the<br>
high temperature level sensor electronics.<br>
A distance meter sensor 8 is focussed on the upper surface of<br>
the shell of the tundish 3, to locate the instantaneous position<br>
of the tundish 3 in the vertical plane. The distance meter sensor<br>
8.<br><br>
can be a Leica Switzerland make laser distance meter. The two<br>
signals generated by the level management laser sensor 6 and<br>
laser distance meter S are current signals of 4 to 20 milli<br>
amperes. These are converted to voltage signals with the helpof a<br>
converter 14 before being fed to a processor 16.<br>
The processor 16 is provided with a built-in analog to digital<br>
(A/D) converter (not shown) for receiving the signals from the<br>
level measurement sensor 6 and distance meter sensor 8, now<br>
converted into voltage signals.<br>
The processor 16 for calculating and displaying in a visual<br>
display unit 18 the metal level of tundish 3 can be a Motorola<br>
68000 processor. The tundish level calculations require prior<br>
knowledge of inclinations (from vertical) of both the sensors,<br>
which is obtained by carrying out calibration of the two sensors.<br>
The calibration layout is schematically shown in Figure 4. The<br>
maximum vertical movement (h) of the tundish is known. The two<br>
sensors inclinations can be estimated by using the following<br>
formulae:<br><br><br>
Where,<br>
8 = Level measurement laser sensor's inclination from the<br>
R<br>
vertical<br>
B = Laser distance-meter sensor's inclination from the<br>
L<br>
vertical<br>
RT - Level measurement laser sensor's reading of the bottom of<br>
B<br>
the tundish when it is at its lower most position in<br>
the vertical plane.<br>
RT = Level measurement laser sensor's reading of the bottom of<br>
T<br>
the tundish when it is at its upper most position in<br>
the vertical plane<br>
LT = Laser distance measurement reading of the upper surface of<br>
B<br>
the tundish when it is at its lower most position in<br>
the vertical plane<br>
LT = Laser distance measurment reading of the upper surface of<br>
T<br>
the tundish when it is at its upper most position in<br>
the vertical plane.<br>
In order to obtain the height of steel filled in the tundish<br>
fallowing formula is used :<br>
RTT x cose +(cosθL x(Dist.Meas Reading- LTT)-(LevelDistRead,xcosθR)<br>
From the three dimensional structural drawing of the tundish<br>
volume of steel at different selected fill heights of metal can be<br><br>
obtained. Knowing the density of liquid steel volume is converted to weight unit.<br>
A piecewise non-linear regression is then carried out between the height of metal<br>
and the corresponding calculated tundish weight. Table 1 shows the result of the<br>
regression for a tundish used for slab casting.<br><br><br>
