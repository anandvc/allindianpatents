				<td>The  present  invention  relates  to  a  luggage  disposable around the handle of a wheeled suitcase.<br>
2.     Description of the Belated Art<br>
Travellers often carry a number of pieces of luggage. Typically, at least one piece is bulky and at least one other piece is a relatively small tote. Many bulky pieces of luggage have wheels and an extendible handle so that a user may wheel the bulky piece of luggage along by the handle after extending same.<br>
It has been recognized that the handle bars of the extended handle could act as a support for a tote such that the tote could be transported on the wheeled luggage. Known totes adapted for this purpose either have complicated mechanisms for permitting the tote to be mounted on the handle bars or present catching hazards requiring closures to avoid such hazards,<br>
The present Invention seeks to overcome drawbacks of the known prior art.<br>
summary of  the Invention<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a piece of luggage comprialng a first body portion having at<br>
least one compartment, a second body port ion having a compartment, said second body portion Joined to said first body portion so as to form a passageway (channel) between said first t&gt;ody portion and said second body portion, said passageway being open at two opposed ends and sized to permit a Handle of a wheeled suitcase to pass therethrough.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a luggage, disposable around the handle of a wheeled suitcase, comprising:<br>
a first body portion having at least one compartment therein;<br>
a second body portion having a compartment therein;<br>
a sidewall of said second body portion being joined to a sidewall of said first body portion along a first join line and along a second join line;<br>
said second join line being spaced from said first join line so as to provide a channel which extends between said first join line and said second join line and between said sidewall of said first body portion and said sidewall of said second body portion, said channel sized to permit the handle of a wheeled suitcase to pass therethrough; and<br>
wherein at  least  one  of  said  join lines  comprises  a permanent connection between said first body portion and. said second body portion, and wherein at least one of said sidewalls is substantially parallel to and in contact with the handle when the luggage is disposed around the handle.<br>
Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawings    <br>
Figure 1 la a perspective view of a piece of luggage<br>
made in accordance with this Invention shown supported on a<br>
handle of a wheeled suitcase,	'<br>
figure 2 is a perspective view looking in the direction of arrow 2 of figure 1,<br>
figure 3 la a partially cross-sectional view along the lines 3-3 of figure 2,  and<br>
figure 4 is a cross-sectional view along the lines 4-4 of figure 2.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodinents<br>
Turning to figure 1, a piece of luggage 10 made In accordance with this invention la shown in place on the handle bars 12 of an extensible handle 11 of a piece of wheeled luggage 14.  Wheeled luggage 14 has wheels 16.<br>
Referencing figure 2, the piece of luggage 10 has a first body portion 20 with compartments 22  and 24. The piece of luggage also has a second body portion 30 with compartment 32. The second body portion 30 is :lolned to the first body portion 20 so as to form a passageway, or channel, 40 between the first<br>
and second body portions. This passageway is sized for receiving handle 11 of the wheeled suitcase 14. Compartment 32 of the second body portion 30 has a zipper fastener 34 which extends along a top wall 36 of the second body portion 30.<br>
Prom figure 3 and figure 4, it will be apparent that the join between the body portions 20, 30 results from Join lines 50 and 52 between eldewall 62 of the second body portion 30 and sldewall 60 of the first body portion 20. These Join lines are lines of stitching comprising a main section 50a, S2a esctending along opposed edges of the second body portion between a short extension 50b, 52b along the bottom 76 of the second body portion 30 and a short extension SOc, S2c along the top 36 of the second body portion such that the resulting passageway 40 l5 open at both of Its ends 56 and 58. As will be apparent from figure 4, the main sections 50a, 52a of the two Join lines SO, 52 are parallel to each other and the Join lines 50, 52 are spaced to permit the handle 11 of the wheeled suitcase to pass through the passageway.<br>
Prom figure 3, it will be noted that sldewall 60 of the first body portion 20 has wear resistant protuberances in the nature of beads or protective cloth welts 66 and 68 directed toward sldewall 62 of the second body portion 30. Similarly, the second body portion 30 has wear resistant beads or protective cloth welts 70 and 72 directed toward the sldewall 60 of the first body portion.<br>
As will be apparent from the figures, the piece of luggage lo Is soft-sided.<br>
In use, the passageway 40 of the piece of luggage lo<br>
may be registered with extended handle 11 of a wheeled suitcase 14 and the piece of luggage moved toward the handle such that the passageway receives the handle. Once the piece of luggage is slipped onto the handle bars 12, it will be supported by the handle. The top 50c. 52c and bottom 50b, 52b extensions of the loin lines act to centre the handle bars 12 in the passageway 40 thereby Improving the stability of the piece of luggage 10 on the piece of luggage 14. If the piece of luggage lo is oriented as shown in the figures, compartment 32 will be presented toward a user 18 (figure 1) when the piece of luggage 14 is being wheeled along. This provides a relatively secure compartment on the piece of luggage 10 which is still readily accessible by a user. It will also be apparent from the figures that whether or not the piece of luggage 10 is supported on handle 11 of a piece of Wheeled luggage 14, the provision of passageway 40 through the luggage 10 creates a minimal catching hazard. This la in part due to the extensions 50b, 52b, 50c, 52c of the Join lines 50, 52 which aid in maintaining the passageway 40 In a substantially closed condition, when the piece of luggage 10 is not supported on handle bars 12, and opened only so far as required to accommodate handle bars 12. vdien the piece Is in place on the handle bars.<br>
The beads or welts 66, 68, 70 and 72 (figure 3) extend toward handle 11 so as to reduce the wear on sidewalla 60 and 62 resulting from the movement of luggage 10 on handle bars 12.<br>
Modi float ions to the Invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art and, therefore, the invention is defined in the claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
