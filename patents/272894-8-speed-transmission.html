CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims the benefit of United States Provisional Patent Application No.<br>
60/910,009, filed April 4th, 2007 and which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to a power transmission having three planetary<br>
gear sets that are controlled by six torque-transmitting devices to provide eight forward speed<br>
ratios and one reverse speed ratio.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Passenger vehicles include a powertrain that is comprised of an engine, multi-<br>
speed transmission, and a differential or final drive. The multi-speed transmission increases<br>
the overall operating range of the vehicle by permitting the engine to operate through its torque<br>
range a number of times. The number of forward speed ratios that are available in the<br>
transmission determines the number of times the engine torque range is repeated. Early<br>
automatic transmissions had two speed ranges. This severely limited the overall speed range<br>
of the vehicle and therefore required a relatively large engine that could produce a wide speed<br>
and torque range. This resulted in the engine operating at a specific fuel consumption point<br>
during cruising, other than the most efficient point. Therefore, manually-shifted (countershaft<br>
transmissions) were the most popular.<br>
[0003]	With the advent of three- and four-speed automatic transmissions, the automatic<br>
shifting (planetary gear) transmission increased in popularity with the motoring public. These<br>
transmissions improved the operating performance and fuel economy of the vehicle. The<br>
increased number of speed ratios reduces the step size between ratios and therefore improves<br>
 <br>
the shift quality of the transmission by making the ratio interchanges substantially<br>
imperceptible to the operator under normal vehicle acceleration.<br>
[0004]	Six-speed transmissions offer several advantages over four- and five-speed<br>
transmissions, including improved vehicle acceleration and improved fuel economy. While<br>
many trucks employ power transmissions having six or more forward speed ratios, passenger<br>
cars are still manufactured with three- and four-speed automatic transmissions and relatively<br>
few five- or six-speed devices due to the size and complexity of these transmissions.<br>
[0005]	Seven-, eight- and nine-speed transmissions provide further improvements in<br>
acceleration and fuel economy over six-speed transmissions. However, like the six-speed<br>
transmissions discussed above, the development of seven-, eight- and nine-speed transmissions<br>
has been precluded because of complexity, size and cost.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]	The preferred embodiment of the present invention provides an improved<br>
transmission having three planetary gear sets controlled to provide at least eight forward speed<br>
ratios and at least one reverse speed ratio.<br>
[0007]	The transmission family of the present invention has three planetary gear sets,<br>
each of which includes a first, second and third member, which members may comprise a sun<br>
ear, a ring gear, or a planet carrier assembly member, in any order.<br>
[0008]	In referring to the first, second and third gear sets in this description and in the<br>
claims, these sets may be counted "first" to "third" in any order in the drawings (i.e., left to<br>
right, right to left, etc.). Additionally, the first, second or third members of each gear set may<br>
be counted "first" to "third" in any order in the drawings (i.e., top to bottom, bottom to top,<br>
etc.) for each gear set.<br>
[0009]	Each carrier member can be either a sing-pinion carrier member (simple) or a<br>
double-pinion carrier member (compound). Embodiments with long pinions are also possible<br>
 <br>
[0010]	A first interconnecting member continuously connects the sun gear member of<br>
the second planetary gear set with the sun gear member of the third planetary gear set.<br>
[0011]	A second interconnecting member continuously connects the planet carrier<br>
assembly member of the second planetary gear set with the planet carrier assembly member of<br>
the third planetary gear set.<br>
[0012]	The planet carrier assembly member of the first planetary gear set is<br>
continuously connected with a stationary member (transmission housing/casing).<br>
[0013]	The input member is continuously connected with the sun gear member of the<br>
first planetary gear set. The output member is continuously connected with the ring gear<br>
member of the third planetary gear set.<br>
[0014]	A first torque-transmitting device, such as a brake, selectively connects the sun<br>
gear member of the second planetary gear set with a stationary member (transmission<br>
housing/casing).<br>
[0015]	A second torque-transmitting device, such as a brake, selectively connects the<br>
planet carrier assembly member of the second planetary gear set with a stationary member<br>
(transmission housing/casing).<br>
[0016]	A third torque-transmitting device, such as a clutch, selectively connects the sun<br>
gear member of the first planetary gear set with the sun gear member of the second planetary<br>
gear set.<br>
[0017]	A fourth torque-transmitting device, such as a clutch, selectively connects the<br>
sun gear member of the first planetary gear set with the planet carrier assembly member of the<br>
second planetary gear set.<br>
[0018]	A fifth torque-transmitting device, such as a clutch, selectively connects the ring<br>
gear member of the first planetary gear set with the ring gear member of the second planetary<br>
gear set.<br>
 <br>
[0019]	A sixth torque-transmitting device, such as a clutch, selectively connects the<br>
ring gear member of the first planetary gear set with the sun gear member of the second<br>
planetary gear set.<br>
[0020]	The six torque-transmitting devices are selectively engageable in combinations<br>
of two to yield at least eight forward speed ratios and at least one reverse speed ratio.<br>
[0021]	A variety of speed ratios and ratio spreads can be realized by suitably selecting<br>
the tooth ratios of the planetary gear sets. The transmission is particularly useful in a front-<br>
wheel drive configuration. Also, it uses all single transition shifts, and provides two overdrive<br>
ratios.<br>
[0022]	The above features and other features and advantages of the present invention<br>
are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the best modes for carrying out<br>
the invention when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0023]	FIGURE 1a is a schematic representation of a powertrain including a planetary<br>
transmission in accordance with the present invention;<br>
[0024]	FIGURE 1b is a truth table and chart depicting some of the operating<br>
characteristics of the powertrain shown in Figure 1a; and<br>
[0025]	FIGURE 1c is a schematic representation of the powertrain of Figure 1a<br>
depicted in lever diagram form.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0026]	Referring to the drawings, there is shown in Figure la a powertrain 10 having a<br>
conventional engine and torque converter 12, a planetary transmission 14, and a conventional<br>
final drive mechanism 16. The engine 12 may be powered using various types of fuel to<br>
improve the efficiency and fuel economy of a particular application. Such fuels may include,<br>
for example, gasoline; diesel; ethanol; dimethyl ether; etc.<br>
 <br>
[0027]	The planetary transmission 14 includes an input member 17 continuously<br>
connected with the engine 12, a planetary gear arrangement 18, and an output member 19<br>
continuously connected with the final drive mechanism 16. The planetary gear arrangement 18<br>
includes three planetary gear sets 20, 30 and 40.<br>
[0028]	The planetary gear set 20 includes a sun gear member 22, a ring gear member<br>
124, and a planet carrier assembly member 26. The planet carrier assembly member 26<br>
includes a plurality of pinion gears 27, 28 rotatably mounted on a carrier member 29. The<br>
pinion gears 27 are disposed in meshing relationship with the sun gear member 22. The pinion<br>
gears 28 are disposed in meshing relationship with the ring gear member 24 and with the<br>
respective pinion gears 27.<br>
[0029]	The planetary gear set 30 includes a sun gear member 32, a ring gear member<br>
34, and a planet carrier assembly member 36. The planet carrier assembly member 36<br>
includes a plurality of pinion gears 37 rotatably mounted on a carrier member 39 and disposed<br>
in meshing relationship with both the ring gear member 34 and the sun gear member 32.<br>
[0030]	The planetary gear set 40 includes a sun gear member 42, a ring gear member<br>
44, and a planet carrier assembly member 46. The planet carrier assembly member 46<br>
includes a plurality of pinion gears 47 mounted on a carrier member 49 and disposed in<br>
meshing relationship with both the ring gear member 44 and the sun gear member 42.<br>
[0031]	The input member 17 is continuously connected with the sun gear member 22 of<br>
the planetary gear set 20. The output member 19 is continuously connected with the ring gear<br>
member 44 of the planetary gear set 40. The planet carrier assembly member 26 is<br>
continuously connected with the transmission housing 60.<br>
[0032]	A first interconnecting member 70 continuously connects the sun gear member<br>
32 of the planetary gear set 30 with the sun gear member 42 of the planetary gear set 40. A<br>
second interconnecting member 72 continuously connects the planet carrier assembly member<br>
36 of the planetary gear set 30 with the planet carrier assembly member 46 of the planetary<br>
gear set 40.<br>
 <br>
[0033]	The planetary gear arrangement also includes six torque-transmitting devices 50,<br>
52, 54, 55, 56 and 57. The torque-transmitting devices 50 and 52 are stationary-type torque-<br>
transmitting devices, commonly termed brakes or reaction clutches. The torque-transmitting<br>
devices 54, 55, 56 and 57 are rotating-type torque-transmitting devices, commonly termed<br>
clutches.<br>
[0034]	A first torque-transmitting device, such a brake 50, selectively connects the sun<br>
gear member 32 of the planetary gear set and the sun gear member 42 of the planetary gear set<br>
40 via interconnecting member 70 with the transmission housing 60, and with the planet carrier<br>
assembly member 26 of the planetary gear set 20. A second torque-transmitting device, such<br>
as brake 52, selectively connects the planet carrier assembly member 36 of the planetary gear<br>
set 30 and the planet carrier assembly member 46 of the planetary gear set 40 via<br>
interconnecting member 72 with the transmission housing 60. A third torque-transmitting<br>
device, such as clutch 54, selectively connects the sun gear member 22 of the planetary gear<br>
set 20 with the sun gear member 32 of the planetary gear set 30 and the sun gear member 42 of<br>
the planetary gear set 40 via interconnecting member 70. A fourth torque-transmitting device,<br>
such as clutch 55, selectively connects the sun gear member 22 of the planetary gear set 20<br>
with the planet carrier assembly member 36 of the planetary gear set 30 and the planet carrier<br>
assembly member 46 of the planetary gear set 40 via interconnecting member 72. A fifth<br>
torque-transmitting device, such as clutch 56, selectively connects the ring gear member 24 of<br>
the planetary gear set 20 with the ring gear member 34 of the planetary gear set 30. A sixth<br>
torque-transmitting device, such as clutch 57, selectively connects the ring gear member 24 of<br>
the planetary gear set 20 with the sun gear member 32 of the planetary gear set 30 and the sun<br>
gear member 42 of the planetary gear set 40 via interconnecting member 70.<br>
[0035]	As shown in Figure 1b, and in particular the truth table disclosed therein, the<br>
torque-transmitting devices are selectively engaged in combinations of two to provide at least<br>
eight forward speed ratios and at least one reverse speed ratio, all with single transition<br>
sequential shifts, and including two overdrive ratios.<br>
 <br>
[0036]	As set forth above, the engagement schedule for the torque-transmitting devices<br>
is shown in the truth table of Figure 1b. The chart of Figure 1b describes the gear ratios and<br>
ratio steps that are attained in the above described transmission. For example, the step ratio<br>
between the first and second forward speed ratios is 1.70, while the step ratio between the<br>
reverse speed ratio and first forward ratio is -0.65.<br>
[0037]	Referring to Figure 1c, the embodiment of powertrain 10 depicted in Fig. 1a is<br>
illustrated in a lever diagram format. A lever diagram is a schematic representation of the<br>
components of a mechanical device such as an automatic transmission. Each individual lever<br>
represents a planetary gearset, wherein the three basic mechanical components of the planetary<br>
gear are each represented by a node. Therefore, a single lever contains three nodes: one for<br>
the sun gear member, one for the planet gear carrier member, and one for the ring gear<br>
member. The relative length between the nodes of each lever can be used to represent the ring-<br>
to-sun ratio of each respective gearset. These lever ratios, in turn, are used to vary the gear<br>
ratios of the transmission in order to achieve appropriate ratios and ratio progression.<br>
Mechanical couplings or interconnections between the nodes of the various planetary gear sets<br>
are illustrated by thin, horizontal lines and torque-transmitting devices such as clutches and<br>
brakes are presented as interleaved fingers. If the device is a brake, one set of the fingers is<br>
grounded. Further explanation of the format, purpose and use of lever diagrams can be found<br>
in SAE Paper 810102, authored by Benford, Howard and Leising, Maurice, "The Lever<br>
Analogy: A New Tool in Transmission Analysis", 1981, which is hereby fully incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
[0038]	The powertrain 10 includes an input member 17 continuously connected with the<br>
engine 12, an output member 19 continuously connected with the final drive 16, a first<br>
planetary gear set 20A having three nodes: a first node 22A, a second node 26A and a third<br>
node 24A; a second planetary gear set 30A having three nodes: a first node 32A, a second<br>
node 36A and a third node 34A; and a third planetary gear set 40A having three nodes: a first<br>
node 42A, a second node 46A and a third node 44A.<br>
 <br>
[0039]	The input member 17 is continuously connected with the node 22A. The output<br>
member 19 is continuously connected with node 44A. The node 26 A is continuously<br>
connected with the transmission housing 60.<br>
[0040]	The node 32A is continuously connected with the node 42A via interconnecting<br>
member 70. The node 36A is continuously connected with the node 46A via interconnecting<br>
member 72.<br>
[0041]	A first torque-transmitting device, such as brake 50, selectively connects the<br>
nodes 32A and 42A and the transmission housing 60, and with node 26A. A second torque-<br>
transmitting device, such as brake 52, selectively connects the nodes 36A and 46A with the<br>
transmission housing 60. A third torque-transmitting device, such as clutch 54, selectively<br>
connects the node 22A with the node 32A. A fourth torque-transmitting device, such as clutch<br>
55, selectively connects the node 22A with the nodes 36A and 46A via interconnecting member<br>
72. A fifth torque-transmitting device, such as clutch 56, selectively connects the node 24A<br>
with the node 34A. A sixth torque-transmitting device, such as clutch 57, selectively connects<br>
the node 24A with the node 32A.<br>
[0042]	To establish ratios, two torque-transmitting devices are engaged for each gear<br>
state. The engaged torque-transmitting devices are represented by an "X" in each respective<br>
row. For example, to establish reverse gear, the brake 52 and clutch 54 are engaged. The<br>
brake 52 engages the nodes 36A and 46A with the transmission housing 60. The clutch 54<br>
engages the node 22A with the node 32A. Likewise, the eight forward ratios are achieved<br>
through different combinations of clutch engagement as per Figure 1c.<br>
[0043]	The powertrain 10 may share components with a hybrid vehicle, and such a<br>
combination may be operable in a "charge-depleting mode". For purposes of the present<br>
invention, a "charge-depleting mode" is a mode wherein the vehicle is powered primarily by an<br>
electric motor/generator such that a battery is depleted or nearly depleted when the vehicle<br>
reaches its destination. In other words, during the charge-depleting mode, the engine 12 is only<br>
operated to the extent necessary to ensure that the battery is not depleted before the destination is<br>
 <br>
reached. A conventional hybrid vehicle operates in a "charge-sustaining mode", wherein if the<br>
battery charge level drops below a predetermined level (e.g., 25%) the engine is automatically<br>
run to recharge the battery. Therefore, by operating in a charge-depleting mode, the hybrid<br>
vehicle can conserve some or all of the fuel that would otherwise be expended to maintain the<br>
25% battery charge level in a conventional hybrid vehicle. It should be appreciated that a hybrid<br>
vehicle powertrain is preferably only operated in the charge-depleting mode if the battery can be<br>
recharged after the destination is reached by plugging it into an energy source.<br>
[0044]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described in<br>
detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the scope of the<br>
