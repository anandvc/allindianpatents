				<td>This invention relates to substituted dioic acid diameters which are useful as pharmaceuticals, e.g., in inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases such as collagenase, and in inhibiting TNF production, particularly for treatment of diseases or conditions mediated by over-produdtion of or over-responsiveness to TNFa.<br>
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a cytokine which is produced initially as a membrane-bound 28 kD precursor. It is then cleaved by an enzyme (TNF convertase) and released as a soluble, active 17 kD form. Soluble TNF exists in at least two forms, TNFa. and TNFP, of which TNFa appears to be the more significant clinically. TNFa is believed to mediate inflammation and other conditions associated with septic shock or acute infections. Long term overstimulation by TNFa is believed to play a role in autoimmune and chronic inflammatory conditions, such as arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and the like.<br>
It has been shown that certain matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors of the hydroxamic acid class, in particular 3-imino-4-oxo-heptane-l,7-dioic acid (7-N-hydroxy) diamides (which are optionally further 1-N-, 2-, 5-, and 6- substituted) are capable of mediating TNFa production, possibly by inhibiting TNF convertase. Known representatives of this class of compounds are summarized and described, e.g., in WO 94/10990.<br>
It has now surprisingly been discovered that a new class of hydroxamic acid derivatives ("Novel Compounds") are potent TNFa suppressors and have advantageous pharmaceutical properties, in particular, oral bioavailability.<br>
The Novel Compounds are 3-imino-4-oxo-6-(oxymethyl)-heptane-l,7-dioic acid (7-N-hydroxy) diamides. Suitably, the 6-oxymethyl substituent is of formula II below, e.g., hydroxymethyl or mono- or polyalkoxymethyl. The Novel Compounds may have further substitutions at the 1-N-, 2-, and 5- positions as known in the art, e.g., as described in WO<br><br>
94/10990, or as further described herein. For example, the Novel Compounds may be 1-N substituted with methyl, pyridyl, or a substituent of formula X-Y- or X'-Y- as described below, e.g., 3-imino-4-oxo-6-(oxymethyl)-heptane-l,7-dioic acid (l-N-morpholinocarbonylalkyl, 7-N-hydroxy) diamide, and may be in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form.<br>
A particularly preferred class of Novel Compounds are 3-imino-4-oxo-5-aryl-6-(oxymethyl)-heptane-l,7-dioic acid (7-N-hydroxy) diamides. The 5-aryl substituent may be as further described herein, e.g. wherein the 5-aryl substituent is phenyl optionally substituted, conveniently at the 4-position, e.g. by hydroxy-, Cue alkyl-. Cue alkoxy-, amino-, halo- or cyano-. Such 5-aryl substituted Novel Compounds may be in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form.<br><br>

Optionally, protecting and deprotecting steps may be included in the above described processes as necessary to preserve the integrity of the intermediates and the final product.<br>
The invention further includes per seXhs novel intermediates of formulae HI and IV as defined above.<br>
As discussed in the test examples below, the Novel Compounds are potent inhibitors of TNFa release, are orally active, and are not cytotoxic at their effective doses. The Novel Compounds also inhibit coUagenase and stromelysin at concentrations of from 0.3 to 10 nM. The Novel Compounds tested further show oral activity in vivo at dosages of less than 10 mg / kg in LPS induced TNFa release in the rat, and appear to be well tolerated at such dosages. Accordingly, the Novel Compounds have pharmaceutical utility as follows:<br>
The Novel Compounds are useful for the prophylaxis and treatment of diseases or pathological conditions mediated by TNF, especially TNFa, e.g., inflammatory conditions, autoimmune diseases, severe infections, and organ or tissue transplant rejection, e.g. for the treatment of recipients of heart, lung, combined heart-lung, liver, kidney, pancreatic, skin or corneal transplants and for the prevention of graft-versus-host disease, such as following bone marrow transplants.<br><br>
The Novel Compounds are particularly useful for the treatment, prevention, or amelioration of autoimmune disease and of inflammatory conditions, in particular inflammatory conditions with an aetiology including an autoimmune component such as arthritis (for example rheumatoid arthritis, arthritis chronica progrediente and arthritis deformans) and rheumatic diseases. Specific auto-immune diseases for which the Novel Compounds may be employed include autoimmune haematological disorders (including e.g. hemolytic anaemia, aplastic anaemia, pure red cell anaemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenia), systemic lupus erythematosus, polychondritis, sclerodoma, Wegener granulamatosis, dermatomyositis, chronic active hepatitis, myasthenia gravis, psoriasis, Steven-Johnson syndrome, idiopathic sprue, autoimmune inflammatory bowel disease (including e.g. ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), endocrine ophthalmopathy, Graves disease, sarcoidosis, multiple sclerosis, primary biliary cirrhosis, juvenile diabetes (diabetes mellitus type I), uveitis (anterior and posterior), keratoconjunctivitis sicca and vemal keratoconjunctivitis, interstitial lung fibrosis, psoriatic arthritis and glomerulonephritis (with and without nephrotic syndrome, e.g. including idiopathic nephrotic syndrome or minimal change nephropathy).<br>
The Novel Compounds are also useful for the treatment, prevention, or amelioration of asthma, bronchitis, pneumoconiosis, pulmonary emphysema, and other obstructive or inflammatory diseases of the aifways.<br>
The Novel Compounds are useful for treating undesirable acute and hyperacute inflammatory reactions which are mediated by TNF, especially by TNFa, e.g., acute infections, for example septic shock (e.g., endotoxic shock and adult respiratory distress syndrome), meningitis, pneumonia; and severe bums; and for the treatment of cachexia or wasting syndrome associated with morbid TNF release, consequent to infection, cancer, or organ dysfunction, especially AIDS -related cachexia, e.g., associated with or consequential to HIV infection.<br>
In addition to inhibiting the release of TNF, especially TNFa through the suppression of TNF convertase, the Novel Compounds are also inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases.<br><br>
e.g., coUagenase, stromelysin and gelatinases, and hence useful for the indications known for coUagenase inhibitors or other matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, e.g., treatment of various pathological conditions of the skin, bones, and connective tissues, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, periodontitis, gingivitis, and corneal ulceration; for the treatment of cardiovascular disease, e.g., atherosclerosis, and coronary angioplasty; for the prevention of tumor cell metastasis and invasion and in inducing fibrosis of tumors, e.g., in the treatment of cancer; and for the prevention of neurodegenerative disorders, e.g., Alzheimer's disease.<br>
For the above indications the appropriate dosage will, of course, vary depending, for example, on the particular Novel Compound employed, the subject to be treated, the mode of administration and the nature and severity of the condition being treated. However, in general, satisfactory results in animals are obtained at daily dosages of from about 1 to about lOmg/kg/day p.o.. In larger mammals, for example humans, an indicated daily dosage is in the range of from about 50 to about 750mg of Novel Compound administered orally once or, more suitably, in divided dosages two to four times/day.<br>
The Novel Compounds may be administered by any conventional route, e.g. orally, for example in the form of solutions for drinking, tablets or capsules or parenterally, for example in the form of injectable solutions or suspensions. Normally for systemic administration oral dosage forms are preferred, although for some indications the Novel Compounds may also be administered topically or dermally, e.g. in the form of a dermal cream or gel or like preparation or, for the purposes of application to the eye, in the form of an ocular cream, gel or eye-drop preparation; or may be administered by inhalation, e.g., for treating asthma. Suitable unit dosage forms for oral administration comprise e.g. from 25 to 250mg Novel Compound per unit dosage.<br>

Test Example 1; Inhibition of TNF release<br>
Mononuclear cells are prepared from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers using ficoll-hypaque density separation according to the method of Hansell et al., J. Imm. Methods (1991) 145: 105. and used at a concentration of 10 cells/well in RPMI1640 plus 10% PCS. Cells are incubated with serial dilutions of the test compounds for 30 minutes at 37°C prior to the addition of IFNy (100 U/ml) and LPS (5 fxg/ ml) and subsequently further incubated for three hours. Incubation is terminated by centrifugation at 1400 RPM for 10 min. TNFa in the supernatant is measured using a commercial<br>
ELISA (Innotest hTNFa, available from Innogenetics N.V., Zwijnaarde, Belgium). Novel Compounds are tested at concentrations of from 0 to 10 |iM. Exemplified compounds of formula I, especially of formula la, suppress TNF release in this assay with an IC50 of from about 50 nM to about 5 iM.<br>
Test Example 2; Cytotoxicity<br>
Cytotoxicity is determined on THPl cells (5x10"*/ well) which are incubated in the presence of IFNy (100 U/ml) and LPS (5 |ig/ ml) and presence and absence of test compound for 24 hours at 37°C. Percentages of living and dead cells are assessed by a colorimetric readout (MTT), which measures mitochondrial dehydrogenase enzymes in living cells, as described in Mosman, J. Imm. Methods (1983) 65: 55. Novel Compounds tested show less than 50% cytotoxicity at a concentration of 10 pM, showing that the Novel Compounds are not cytotoxic at concentrations sufficient to suppress TNF.<br>
Test Example 3; Collagenase inhibition<br>
CoUagenase inhibition is determined using active collagenase with the thiopeptide MMP-substrate described in Stein and Izquierdo-Martin, Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 308 (1994) pp. 274-277. Test compound is incubated with the collagenase prior to the addition of the substrate at pH 6.5,25°C in 2-morpholinoethanesulphonic acid (50mM) buffer with lOmM CaCl2. The absorbance is recorded at 405nm at regular intervals for a period of 40 minutes. The inhibitory activity of the test compound is determined as a function of the collagenase activity in the control in the presence<br><br>
and absence of the test compound. The Novel Compounds show significant dose dependent inhibition of coUagenase at low nM concentrations, e.g., below 10 nM.<br>
Test Example 4; Oral bioavailability<br>
The assay of the preceding example is standardized by measuring activity of varying known concentrations of a particular test compound and used to measure the concentration of test compound in plasma following oral administration. Test compounds are admistered orally to conscious rats at a dosage of 10 mg/kg. Blood samples are taken from the cut tip of the tail at 30, 60,120, and 240 minutes from oral administration. The plasma is subjected to trichloroacetic acid extraction. The extract is tested in the above coUagenase inhibition assay to obtain an estimate of the concentration of drug present in the plasma. The Novel Compounds show good oral bioavailability, with plasma concentrations of 300-5000 nM after 30 minutes and 50-500 nM after 240 minutes. Thus, pharmaceutically effective plama levels (as shown in Test Example 1 and 3) are readily achievable with oral administration at manageable dosages, e.g., 10 mg/kg. Moreover, the plasma levels obtained are well below the cytotoxic level, and the rats were not observed to show any adverse effects at this dosage.<br><br><br>
