				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a cooling air supplying device in a refrigerator, and more particularly, to a cooling air supplying device in a refrigerator, which is capable of impartially and rapidly supplying cooling air to a chilling chamber.<br>
2.	Description of the Background Art<br>
In general, a refrigerator is divided into a freezing chamber for keeping an ice making container and frozen food and a chilling chamber for keeping cold food. The refrigerator includes a freezing cycle for supplying cooling air to the freezing chamber and the chilling chamber.<br>
A common type refrigerator, where the freezing chamber and the chilling chamber are arranged in a vertical direction, and a side-by-side type refrigerator having a large capacity, where the freezing chamber and the chilling chamber are arranged in a horizontal direction, are mainly used.<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view showing a partially sectioned side-by-side type refrigerator according to a conventional technology. Figure 2 is a sectional view taken along the line A-A.<br>
A conventional refrigerator includes a main frame 204, in which a pair of doors 202 bi-directionaify opened and closed are installed in the front portion and a receipt space is included, a freezing chamber 206 arranged on either the left<br><br>
side or the right side of the main frame 204, the freezing chamber 106 for keeping<br>
frozen food, a chilling chamber 208 separated from the chilling chamber 206 by a<br>
mullion wall 210 and arranged on the other side of the main frame 204, the chilling<br>
chamber 208 for keeping cold food, a freezing chamber cooling air supplying<br>
device installed in the upper portion of the freezing chamber 206, the freezing<br>
chamber cooling air supplying device for supplying the air cooled while passing<br>
through the freezing cycle (not shown) to the freezing chamber 106, and a chilling<br>
chamber cooling air supplying device connected to the freezing chamber cooling<br>
air supplying  device,  the  chilling  chamber cooling  air supplying  device  for<br>
supplying the cooling air to the chilling chamber 208.<br>
A plurality of shelves 212 and 214 are installed in the freezing chamber 206 and the chilling chamber 208 to be separated from each other by a predetermined distance so that food can be kept by layers. Vegetable boxes 216 and 218 for keeping vegetables are bedded in the lower portion of the shelves 212 and 214.<br>
The freezing cooling air supplying device includes a blast fan 220 installed on the hind surface in the upper portion of the freezing chamber 206, the freezing chamber cooling air supplying device for forcibly bowing the air cooled whiled passing through the freezing cycle, a first panel 226 arranged in front of the blast fan 220 and having a plurality of discharge openings 224 so that the cooling air blown by the blast fan 220 is discharged into an ice maker 222, and a second panel 228 arranged below the blast fan 220 and having a plurality of discharge openings 230 so that the cooling air is discharged into the freezing chamber 206.<br>
The chilling chamber cooling air supplying device includes a cooling air supply path 232 formed in the upper portion of the mullion wall 210 so as to<br>
2<br><br>
discharge the cooling air blown from the blast fan 220 installed in the freezing chamber 206 into the chilling chamber 208, a cooling air discharge duct 234 installed in the upper portion of the chilling chamber 208 and connected to the cooling air supply path 232, the cooling air discharge duct 234 for discharging the cooling air supplied to the cooling air supply path 232 into the chilling chamber 208, and a cooling air suction path 238 formed in the lower portion of the mullion wall 210, the cooling air suction path 238 for sucking up the cooling air that completed a cooling operation while circulating in the chilling chamber 208 into the freezing cycle.<br>
The cooling air discharge duct 234 is horizontally arranged in the upper portion of the chilling chamber 208. One side of the cooling air discharge duct 234 is opened to be connected to the cooling air supply path 232. A plurality of cooling air discharge openings 236 for discharging the cooling air into the chilling chamber 208 are formed in the front portion of the cooling air discharge duct 234.<br>
According to the conventional side-by-side type refrigerator having the above structure, when the freezing cycle is driven and the blast fan 220 is rotated, the air cooled while passing through the freezing cycle is discharged into the discharge openings 224 of the first panel, the discharge openings 230 of the second panel, and the cooling air supply path 232 by the blast pressure of the blast fan 220.<br>
The cooling air discharged into the discharge openings 224 of the first panel is supplied to the ice maker 222, to thus make ice. The air discharged into the discharge openings 230 of the second panel freezes the frozen food stored in the freezing chamber 206 while circulating the freezing chamber 206.<br>
The coofing air supplied to the cooling air supply path 232 is sucked up<br>
3<br><br>
into the cooling air discharge duct 234 and is discharged into the chilling chamber 208 through the cooling air discharge openings 236 formed in the cooling air discharge duct 234. The cooling air discharged into the chilling chamber 208 cools the cold food kept in the chilling chamber 208 while circulating in the chilling chamber 208. The cooling air that completed the cooling operation is sucked up into a cooling cycle through the cooling air suction path 238 formed in the lower portion of the mullion wall 210 and is cooled again while passing through the cooling cycle.<br>
However, according to the chilling chamber cooling air supplying device of the above conventional refrigerator, the cooling air is discharged only through the discharge openings 236 formed in the cooling air discharge duct since the cooling air discharge duct 234 is horizontally arranged in the upper portion of the chilling chamber 208. Therefore, the food stored in the upper portion of the chilling chamber 208 is excessively cooled since the food is significantly affected by the cooling air. The food stored in the lower portion of the chilling chamber 208 is weakly cooled since the food is less affected by the cooling air.<br>
That is, the deviation of temperature of the cooling air supplied from the upper portion of the chilling chamber to the lower portion of the chilling chamber becomes more significant and the temperatures of the respective cells divided by the shelves are different from each other according to the distances from the cooling air discharge openings. Accordingly, the spread of temperature of the chilling chamber is not uniform.<br>
Also, since the cooling air is supplied from the upper portion of the chilling chamber to the lower portion of the chilling chamber, the cooling air cannot smoothly circulate in the chilling chamber due to the shelves for separating the<br><br>
respective cells from each other.<br>
Also, since the cooling air is discharged from only the upper portion of the chilling chamber, it takes longer to cool the entire chilling chamber. Accordingly, the freshness of the food stored in the chilling chamber deteriorates.<br>
Also, it is difficult to rapidly cope with a rise in temperature of the chilling chamber, which is caused by frequently opening and closing the door of the chilling chamber in summer.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a cooling air supplying device of a refrigerator, which is capable of impartially supplying cooling air to the respective cells divided by the shelves of a chilling chamber, to thus make the spread of temperature of the chilling chamber uniform.<br>
