				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
SELF-DIAGNOSIS INDICATION SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a self diagnosis<br>
indication system (a diagnosis indication system) such as<br>
provided on automobiles and/or motorcycles.<br>
Background Art<br>
The configuration and operation flow of a conventional<br>
self-diagnosis indication system is shown in Fig. 2.<br>
As shown in (A) of Fig. 2, detection signals fromrespective<br>
types of sensors for detecting an operating condition of an<br>
engine, an on/off signal from a starter switch and a crank pulse<br>
signal for detecting the rotation of a crankshaft to thereby<br>
calculate an engine rotational speed and a crank angle are<br>
inputted into an ECU (engine control unit). The ECU performs<br>
operation controls on such as ignition timing and fuel injection<br>
based on predetermined programs and maps according to these<br>
signals and outputs an abnormality indication signal to<br>
illuminate an indication lamp so as to indicate the presence<br>
of an abnormal condition when any abnormality is detected which<br>
results from disconnection and short circuit. In addition,<br>
when an abnormal condition is detected at the time of startup,<br>
a startup disablement indication is implemented.<br>
In this startup disablement indicating operation, as<br>
shown in (B) of Fig. 2, whether or not the abnormality was detected<br>
by a self-diagnosis is determined (step S1), and whether or<br>
not the abnormality was detected at the time of startup is<br>
determined by judging whether or not the starter switch was<br>
switched on when the abnormal condition occurred (step S2),<br>
and in the event that it was at the time of startup, then a<br>
startup disablement indication is implemented (step S3).<br>
However, with the conventional self-diagnosis indication<br>
system, since the startup condition is determinedby using on/of f<br>
signals of the starter switch, the determination means and signal<br>
wiring become complex and costs are also increased.<br>
The present invention was intended to deal with the<br>
related art and an object thereof is to provide a self-diagnosis<br>
indication system for performing a startup disablement<br>
indication when an abnormal condition is self-detected at the<br>
time of startup without using on/off signals from a starter<br>
switch.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
With a view to attaining the object, according to the<br>
present invention there is provided a self-diagnosis<br>
indication system for outputting an operation control signal<br>
from an ECU by allowing signals from respective types of sensors<br>
for detecting an operating condition and a crank pulse signal<br>
for detecting a rotation of a crankshaft to enter the ECU and<br>
outputting a startup disablement indication signal in a state<br>
that an abnormal condition is self-detected at the time of<br>
startup, the self-diagnosis indication system being<br>
characterized in that a startup disablement indication signal<br>
is outputted when a crank pulse signal is inputted in the state<br>
that an abnormal condition is self-detected.<br>
According to this configuration, in the event that an<br>
engine is started up in a state that a certain abnormal condition<br>
is self-detected, since the rotation of the engine is detected<br>
by the crank pulse signal, that the abnormality is detected<br>
at the time of startup can be detected by the input of the crank<br>
pulse signal, whereby a startup disablement indication signal<br>
can be outputted so as to indicate that a startup is not possible<br>
Thus, a startup disablement indication can be implemented<br>
without using on/off signals of the starter switch but with<br>
a simple configuration using simple and inexpensive wiring and<br>
circuits.<br>
According to a preferred configuration example, the<br>
self-diagnosis indication system has an abnormality indicating<br>
means for indicating the abnormal condition so self-detected,<br>
whereby a startup disablement condition is indicatedby changing<br>
indication modes of the abnormality indicating means by the<br>
startup disablement indication signal.<br>
According to this configuration, an abnormal condition is indicated by<br>
illuminating, for example, an indication lamp when the abnormal<br>
condition is self-detected, and when a startup is attempted in this<br>
abnormal condition, the indication modes of the indication lamp are<br>
changed, for example, to cause the indication lamp to flash so as to<br>
indicate a startup disablement condition.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided an improved self-diagnosis<br>
indication system used particularly on a vehicle comprising an ECU for<br>
out-putting an operation control signal by means of signals from<br>
respective types of sensors for detecting an operating condition and for<br>
out-putting a startup disablement indication signal in a state that an<br>
abnormal condition is self-detected at the time of startup by means of a<br>
crank pulse signal for detecting a rotation of a crank shaft characterized<br>
in that: a startup disablement indication signal is outputted when a<br>
crank pulse signal is inputted in the state that an abnormal condition is<br>
a self-detected.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 is explanatory drawings depicting the configuration and operation<br>
flow of an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 2 is explanatory drawings depicting the configuration and operation<br>
flow of a conventional abnormality indication system.<br>
Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
Fig. 1 shows explanatory diagrams depicting the configuration and<br>
operation flow of an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in (A) of Fig. 1, detection signals from respective types of<br>
sensors (for example, and intake air pressure sensor, a throttle position<br>
sensor, a coolant temperature sensor, an atmospheric pressure sensor,<br>
and an intake air temperature sensor) for detecting an operating<br>
condition of an engine and a crank pulse signal for detecting the rotation<br>
of a crankshaft to thereby calculate an engine rotational speed and a<br>
crank<br>
angle are inputted into an ECU (engine control unit) . The ECU<br>
performs operation controls on such as ignition timing and fuel<br>
injection based on predetermined programs and maps according<br>
to these signals and outputs an abnormality indication signal<br>
to illuminate an indication lamp so as to indicate the presence<br>
of an abnormal condition when any abnormality is detected which<br>
results from disconnection and short circuit. In addition,<br>
when an abnormal condition is detected at the time of startup,<br>
a startup disablement indication is implemented.<br>
As shown in (B) of Fig. 1, in this flow of startup<br>
disablement indicating operation, firstly, whether or not the<br>
abnormality was detectedby a self-diagnosis is determined (step<br>
T1) . This is a step for determining whether or not a certain<br>
failure such as disconnection or short circuit of the sensors<br>
has been detected. If an abnormality is determined in this<br>
step T1, an abnormality indication is implemented by<br>
illuminating, for example, a red lamp.<br>
Next, whether or not a crank pulse signal exists, that<br>
is, an engine is rotating when the abnormality is occurring<br>
(when YES in T1) is determined (step T2). Thus, whether or<br>
not the engine has been operated to be put in a startup condition<br>
is determined. If the engine is in the startup condition (when<br>
YES in T2), a startup disablement indication is implemented<br>
(step T3). This startup disablement indication can be, for<br>
example, a red lamp flashing indication by changing the<br>
indication modes of the red lamp. Thus, the user can be aware<br>
that the engine is in the operation disablement condition.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
Ashas been described here to fore, in the present invention ,<br>
in the event that the engine is started up in the state that<br>
a certain abnormal condition is self-detected, since the<br>
rotation of the engine is detected by the crank pulse signal,<br>
that the abnormality is detected at the time of startup can<br>
be detected by the input of the crank pulse signal, whereby<br>
a startup disablement indication signal can be outputted so<br>
as to indicate that a startup is not possible. Thus, a startup<br>
disablement indication can be implemented without using on/off<br>
signals of the starter switch but with a simple configuration<br>
using simple and inexpensive wiring and circuits.<br>
