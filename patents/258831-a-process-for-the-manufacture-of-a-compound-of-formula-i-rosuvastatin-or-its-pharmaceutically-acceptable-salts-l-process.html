				<td>CHEMICAL PROCESS<br>
This invention concerns a novel chemical process, and more particularly it concerns a novel chemical process for the manufacture of rosuvastatin and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, especially rosuvastatin calcium, as well novel intermediates used in said process and processes for the manufacture of the novel intermediates.<br>
Rosuvastatin and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts are HMG CoA reductase inhibitors and have use in the treatment of, inter alia, hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia.   Rosuvastatin calcium is marketed under the trademark CRESTORâ„¢. European Patent Application, Publication No. (EPA) 0521471 discloses (E)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-[methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino]pyrimidin-5-yl](3R,5S)-3,5-dihydroxyhept-6-enoic acid (rosuvastatin) and its sodium salt and calcium salt (rosuvastatin calcium, illustrated below) and a process for their preparation.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Rosuvastatin and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts are obtained therein by condensation of methyl (3R)-3-[(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]-5-oxo-6-triphenylphosphoranylidene hexanoate with. 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-(N-methyl-N-methanesulfonylamino)-5-pyrimidinecarboxaldhyde, followed by deprotection of the 3-hydrpxy group, asymmetric reduction of the 5-oxo group and hydrolysis.<br>
Other processes for the preparation of rosuvastatin and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts are described in WO 00/49014 and WO 04/52867.   The compound and its<br><br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts are obtained in WO 00/49104 by reaction of diphenyl [4-(4-fluoropheny)-6-isopropyl-2-[methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino]pyrimidin-5-ylmethyl]<br>
phosphine oxide with tert-butyl 2-[(4R,6S)-6-formyl-2,2-dimethyl-l,3-dioxan-4-yl}acetate in the presence of a base, followed by removal of protecting groups. WO 04/52867 discloses the condensation of l-cyano-(2S)-2-[(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy-4-oxo-5-triphenylphosphoranylidene pentane with 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-(N-methyl-N-methanesulfonylamino)-5-pyrimidinecarboxaldhyde, followed by deprotection, asymmetric reduction of the 4-oxo group and hydrolysis.<br>
However there is a continuing need to identify alternative processes for the manufacture of rosuvastatin and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Such processes may, for example, when compared to previously known processes, be more convenient to use, be more suitable for large scale manufacture, give the product in a better yield, reduce the number of steps involved, use intermediates which are more easily isolated, require less complex purification techniques, use less expensive reagents and/or be more environmentally friendly.<br>
WO 03/004450 (Ciba Specialty Chemicals) discloses a process for preparation of heptanoic acid derivatives and their use as intermediates in the synthesis of statin derivatives. WO 03/018555 (Ciba Specialty Chemicals) discloses a process for preparation of indole derivatives, such as fluvastatin. EP252476 (Warner Lambert) discloses compounds which are HMG Co A reductase inhibitors and a process for their synthesis.<br>
We have now discovered a particularly useful process for preparing rosuvastatin and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for the<br>
manufacture of a compound of formula I<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,<br>
which comprises reaction of a compound of formula II,<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein L is a leaving group and X is a group Z which is N-(methyl)methylsulfonylamino (CHaSO2N(CH3)-) or X is a group Y which is a group that is capable of conversion into the group Z, with a compound of the formula III,<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein<br>
A is selected from a group (i) to (vii) below,<br>
 (vii)<br>
wherein P1 and P2 are independently selected from hydrogen and a hydroxy protecting group, or P1 together with P2 form a 1,3-dihydroxy protecting group; P3 is hydrogen or a hydroxy protecting group;<br>
P4 and P5 are independently selected from hydrogen and a hydroxy protecting group, or P4 together with P5 form a 1,3-dihydroxy protecting group, and P6 and P7 are independently a hydroxy protecting group; or P5 together with P6 form a 1,3-dihydroxy protecting group, and P4 is hydrogen or a hydroxy protecting group and P7 is a hydroxy protecting group; P8 is hydrogen or a hydroxy protecting group; P9 is hydrogen or a hydroxy protecting group;<br>
P10 and P11 are independently selected from hydrogen and a hydroxy protecting group, or P10 together with P11, or P11 together with R4, form a 1,3-dihydroxy protecting group; and unless otherwise stated R1, R2, R3 and R4 are independently carboxy protecting groups;<br>
in the presence of a catalytically effective amount of a palladium catalyst and in the presence of a base;<br>
followed by<br>
(a)	when X is a group Y, the group Y is converted into the group Z;<br>
followed by<br>
(b)	when A is a group (i), carrying out in any order the steps of (1) when P1 is a<br>
hydroxy protecting group, removal of the protecting group P1; (2) when P2 is a hydroxy<br>
protecting group, removal of the protecting group P2; and (3) removal of the protecting group R1;<br>
(c)	when A is a group (ii), carrying out in any order the steps of (1) asymmetric<br>
reduction of the carbonyl group adjacent to the carbon-carbon double bond; (2) when P3 is<br>
a hydroxy protecting group, removal of the protecting group P3; and (3) removal of the<br>
protecting group R2;<br>
(d)	when A is a group (iii), carrying out in any order the steps of (1) when P4 is a<br>
hydroxy protecting group, removal of the protecting group P4; (2) when P5 is a hydroxy<br>
protecting group, removal of the protecting group P5; (3) removal of the protecting group<br>
P6; and (4) removal of the protecting group P7;<br>
(e)	when A is a group (iv), carrying out in any order the steps of (1) when P8 is a<br>
hydroxy protecting group, removal of the protecting group P8;(2) asymmetric hydration of<br>
the carbon-carbon double bond adjacent to the ester group COOR3; and (3) removal of the<br>
protecting group R3;	<br>
(f)	when A is a group (v), carrying out in any order the steps of (1) when P9 is a<br>
hydroxy protecting group, removal of the protecting group P9; and (2) hydrolysis under<br>
basic conditions;<br>
(g)	when A is a group (vi), carrying out in any order the steps of (1) asymmetric<br>
hydration of the ring carbon-carbon double bond; and (2) hydrolysis under basic<br>
conditions; and<br>
(h)      when A is a group (vii), carrying out in any order the steps of (1) asymmetric reduction of the carbon-carbon double bond adjacent to the group COOR4; (2) when P10 is a hydroxy protecting group, removal of the protecting group P10; (3) when P11 is a hydroxy protecting group, removal of the protecting group P11; and (4) removal of the protecting group R4;<br>
whereafter, when the product is obtained in the free acid form, optionally forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the compound of formula I, or when the product is obtained as a salt, optionally converting the product to a different pharmaceutically acceptable salt.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, the carbon atom bearing the group OP1 in the group A(i) is attached directly to the carbon-carbon double bond of formula III, and the groups A(ii) to A(vii) are attached in a likewise manner.<br>
It will be appreciated that tautomeric forms of the groups A are also included within the scope of the present invention. For example, when A is a group (vii) in which P11 is hydrogen, this may exist in the keto form shown below.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
Suitable palladium catalysts are, for example, those disclosed in J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2001,123. 6989-7000 (which reference and more particularly the palladium catalysts described therein are hereby incorporated herein by reference), and analogous palladium catalysts, for carrying out the so-called Heck reaction. Although the Heck reaction is well known in the art for coupling certain aryl and heteroaryl halides (or trifiates or acid chlorides) with alkenes, it has surprisingly been found that the Heck reaction can be carried out with a fully substituted, sterically-hindered 6-membered pyrimidine of formula II.<br>
Particularly suitable palladium catalysts include, for example, those with trialkylphosphine ligands (Pd/P(alkyl)a), especially bis(tri-tert-butylphosphine)palladium (0). A Pd/P(alkyl)3 catalyst wherein the alkyl group is tert-butyl, such as a mixture of Pd2(dba)s and P(t-Bu)3, may also be used.<br>
The term "catalytically effective amount" means an amount from 1 mol% to 30 mol%, particularly from 2 mol% to 20 mol%, and more particularly from 5 mol% to 10 mol%, based on the amount of the compound of formula II.<br>
The compounds of formula II and III are generally reacted together in the ratio of about 1 to 1.<br>
Generally the reaction is carried out in a suitable solvent such as toluene, diphenyl ether and poly(ethylene glycol), and particularly N,N-dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, N,N-dimethylacetamide, or dimethylsulfoxide, and more particularly water and binary mixtures of water and N,N-dimethylformamide and N,N-dimethylacetamide.<br>
Generally the reaction is carried out at a temperature in the range 30-110Â°C, particularly 40-80Â°C, more particularly 50-60Â°C.<br>
Suitable bases for use in the process of the invention include, for example, amine bases, such as ammonia, and particularly bulky tertiary amines such as N-<br>
methyldicyclohexylamine, used either stoichiometrically or catalytically with a stoichiometric amount of an inorganic base, such as cesium carbonate.<br>
The reaction may also optionally be carried out in the presence of a tetrabutylammonium salt, such as tetrabutylammonium chloride or tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate.<br>
Particularly combinations of palladium catalyst, solvent and base (optionally in the presence of a tetrabutylammonium salt), which are suitable for carrying out the process of the invention, include the following:<br>
Bis(tri-tert-butylphosphine)palladium (0), water, N,N-dicyclohexylmethylamine; Bis(tri-tert-butylphosphine)palladium (0), water, N,N-dicyclohexylmethylamine, tetrabutylammonium chloride;<br>
Bis(tri-tert-butylphosphine)palladium (0), water, N,N-dicyclohexylmethylamine, tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate;<br>
Bis(tri-tert-butylphosphine)palladium (0), toluene, N,N-dicyclohexylmethylamine, tetrabutylammonium chloride;<br>
Bis(tri-tert-butylphosphine)palladium (0), N,N-dimethylacetamide, N,N-dicyclohexylmethylamine, tetrabutylammonium chloride; Bis(tri-tert-butylphosphine)palladium (0), water/DMF (1:1), N,N-dicyclohexylmethylamine,<br>
Bis(tri-tert-butylphosphine)palladium (0), water/DMF (1:1), N,N-dicyclohexylmethylamine, tetrabutylammonium chloride; and Bis(tri-tert-butylphosphine)palladium (0), water/DMF (1:1), ammonia.<br>
A leaving group L referred to hereinbefore or hereinafter includes, for example, chloro, bromo, iodo, -OSO2CF3, -COC1, -S02C1 and -C(O)O-SO2Ry wherein Ry is aryl (such as phenyl) or substituted aryl (such as tolyl), particularly chloro, bromo, iodo, -OSO2CF3, and more particularly bromo.<br>
The term "a group that is capable of conversion into a group Z" means that the group Y is selected from any functional group which can be converted, by carrying out one or more synthetic chemical steps, to form the group Z. Suitable groups Y which are capable of such conversion, and the synthetic chemical steps that can be used to carry out the conversion of Y into Z, are well known in the art, for example as described in standard<br>
works such as Contemporary Heterocyclic Chemistry by George R. Newkome and William W. Paudler, published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., and Advanced Organic Chemistry by J. March, 4th and 5th Editions. Typical groups Y and synthetic chemical steps suitable for such conversion are illustrated, for example, in any of Schemes 1 to 5 or in the examples hereinafter, or by analogy therewith.<br>
A group Y referred to hereinbefore or hereinafter includes, for example, hydroxy, chloro, bromo, iodo, amino, methylamino, benzylamino, methanesulfonylamino, N-benzylmethanesulfonylamino, RXSO2O- wherein Rx is (l-6C)alkyl (such as methyl, ethyl or propyl), aryl (such as phenyl) or substituted aryl (such as tolyl), RyC(O)O- wherein Ry is (l-6C)alkyl (such as methyl, ethyl or propyl), aryl (such as phenyl) or substituted aryl (such as tolyl). Particularly suitable groups Y include, for example, hydroxy, chloro, tosyloxy, amino, methylamino and methylsulfonylamino.<br>
The term "aryl" herein includes, for example, a monocyclic or bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbon group that contains 6-12 atoms, such as phenyl, naphthyl, tetrahydronaphthyl, indenyl and indanyl, particularly phenyl. The term "substituted aryl" means an aryl group bearing one or more substituents, for example 1 to 3 substituents, more particularly 1 to 2 substituents. Suitable substituents include, for example, (l-4C)alkyl (such as methyl, ethyl or propyl), (l-4C)alkoxy (such as methoxy or ethoxy) and halogeno (such as chloro, bromo or iodo).<br>
The terms " hydroxy protecting group" and "carboxy protecting group" referred to hereinbefore or hereinafter mean that the hydroxy or carboxy group is protected from reaction by forming a suitable derivative, such as a (l-4C)alkyl ester group. A hydroxy protecting group also includes, for example, tetrahydropyranyl, tert-butyl, methoxymethyl or a silyl radical, for example a silyl radical of the formula SiRs wherein the R radicals can be the same or different and are selected from (l-6C)alkyl, phenyl and phenyl(l-4C)alkyl, in which latter two groups a phenyl group is unsubstituted or bears a halogeno, (1-4C)alkoxy or (l-4C)alkyl substituent. For example, a group SiR3, includes trimethylsilyl and tert-butyldimethylsilyl. Examples of suitable means of protection of hydroxy and carboxy groups (as well as means of formation and eventual deprotection), may be found in T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", Third Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1999. Particular protecting groups hereinbefore or hereinafter for P1 taken together with P2, or P4 taken together with P5, or P5 taken<br>
together with P6, to form a 1,3-dihydroxy protecting group, include those described in EPA 0319845 and GB 2244705, which are included herein by reference. Particularly suitable 1,3-dihydroxy protecting groups include, for example, the groups (a), (b), (c) and (d) illustrated below<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein Rw and Rx are independently (l-4C)alkyl, and Ry and Rz are independently (1-4C)alkyl, or one of Ry and Rz is (l-4C)alkyl and the other is hydrogen, or Ry and Rz taken together with the carbon atom to which they are attached form a cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl or cycloheptyl ring, and more particularly group (a) in which Ry and Rz are both methyl (i.e. an acetonide protecting group). Analogous protecting groups may also be used when P1 ' together with R4 forms a 1,3-dihydroxy protecting group.<br>
Particularly suitable values for R1, R2, R3 and R4 include, for example, (l-4C)alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl and tert-butyl, especially the latter.<br>
It will be appreciated that where more than one protecting group is removed after reacting a compound of the formula II with a compound of formula III, the protecting groups may be removed in any order which allows the compound of formula I to be obtained. It will also be appreciated that protecting groups and conditions for their removal may be chosen which allow for simultaneous removal of more than one protecting group. However it is preferred to carry out a final step under non-acidic conditions to avoid lactonisation of the compound of formula I.<br>
A suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salt includes, for example, an alkali metal salt, for example a sodium or potassium salt, an alkaline earth metal salt, for example, calcium or magnesium salt, an ammonium salt or a salt with an organic base which affords a physiologically-acceptable cation, for example with methylamine, ethylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine , morpholine, diethanolamine, tris(2-hydroxyethyl)amine and tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamine.<br>
When A is a group (ii), the asymmetric reduction of the carbonyl group adjacent to the carbon-carbon double bond may be carried out, for example, using diethylmethoxyborane and sodium borohydride. The reaction may be carried out, for example, in an alcohol-organic solvent mixture. The alcohol may be selected from, for example, methanol, ethanol, propanol and butanol. The non-alcoholic organic solvent may be selected from, for example, acetonitrile, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and dimethylformamide. A particularly suitable combination of solvents is, for example, methanol and tetrahydrofuran. The reaction is generally carried out at a temperature between -100Â°C to 20Â°C, for example between -85Â°C to -70Â°C, under cooling for 10 minutes to 20 hours, for example 30 minutes to 10 hours.<br>
When A is a group (iv), the asymmetric hydration of the carbon-carbon double bond may be carried out, for example, using benzyl aldehyde in the presence of a base, such as potassium tert-butoxide or potassium hexamethyldisilazide, in a suitable solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran, and at a temperature in the range of-20Â°C to +10Â°C, such as about 0Â°C, by analogy with the procedure described in J. Org. Chem., 1993, 58, 2446-2453 which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
When A is a group (vi), the asymmetric hydration of the carbon-carbon double bond may be carried out, for example, using an appropriate alcohol, such as allyl alcohol, in the presence of a base, such as LiOH, or benzyl alcohol in the presence of a base, such as NaOH, followed by reduction using palladium on carbon or palladium hydroxide on carbon under acidic conditions, by analogy with the procedure described in WO 02/05519, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
When A is a group (vii), the asymmetric reduction of the carbon-carbon double bond adjacent to the group COOR4 may be carried out, for example, using similar conditions to those described above for the asymmetric reduction of the carbonyl group of A(ii).<br>
Particular values of variable radicals or groups are as follows. Such values may be used where appropriate with any other of the values, definitions, claims or embodiments defined hereinbefore or hereinafter.<br>
(1)	in formula HI, A is a group (i) wherein P1 and P2 together form an acetonide<br>
protecting group;<br>
(2)	in formula III, A is a group (i) wherein P1 and P2 are both hydrogen;<br>

(5)	in formula III, A is a group (iii) wherein P4 to P7 are all hydroxy protecting groups<br>
(6)	in formula III, A is a group (iii) wherein P4 and P5 are both hydrogen and P6 and P7<br>
are the same or different hydroxy protecting groups (such as (l-4C)alkyl groups, for<br>
example methyl or ethyl)<br>
(7)	in formula III, A is a group (iv) wherein P8 is a hydroxy protecting group (for<br>
example, trimethylsilyl (TMS), triethylsilyl (TES), tert-butyldiphenylsilyl (TBDPS) or tert-<br>
butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS))<br>
(8)	in formula III, A is a group (iv) wherein P8 is hydrogen<br>
(9)	in formula III, A is a group (v) wherein P9 is a hydroxy protecting group<br>
(10)	in formula III, A is a group (v) wherein P9 is hydrogen<br>
(11)	in formula III, A is a group (vi)<br>
(12)	in formula III, A is a group (vii) wherein P10 is hydrogen and P1' together with R4 is<br>
a 1,3-dihydroxy protecting group (for example, P11 together with R4 is an acetonide<br>
protecting group).<br>
Starting materials of the formula II may be obtained, and conversion of a group Y into a group Z may be carried out, for example, as illustrated in the examples or as shown in Schemes 1 to 5 below, or by analogy therewith. It will be appreciated that when a compound of the formula II, wherein X is a group Y, is reacted with a compound of the formula III, then the intermediate obtained will include, for example, a compound as set out in Schemes 1 to 5 bearing the group -L, but in which the group -L is replaced by -CH=CH-A. The group Y may then be converted to the group CHsSC^lSKCHj)- using one or more of the synthetic chemical steps illustrated in Schemes 1 to 5.  In Schemes 1 to 5 and elsewhere herein, the following abbreviations are used:<br>
EtOH = ethanol; NBS = N-bromosuccinimide; DMF = N,N-dimethylformamide; TEA = triethylamine; MeCN = acetonitrile; MsCl = mesyl chloride; TsCl = tosyl chloride; OTs = tosyloxy; THF = tetrahydrofuran; IPA = isopropanol; DCM = dichloromethane<br>
