The present invention relates to herbicidally active compositions comprising herbicides of the HPPDO inhibitor types and certain safeners.<br>
The invention relates to the technical field of the crop protection products, in particular the herbicide/antidote combinations (herbicide/safener combinations) which are outstandingly suitable for the use against competing harmful plants in crops of useful plants.<br>
Some of the more recent herbicidally active substances which inhibit p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPDO) have very good properties on use and can be applied at very low rates against a wide spectrum of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weeds (see, for example, M.P. Prisbylla et al., Brighton Crop Protection Conference - Weeds (1993), 731-738).<br>
US P 5627131, EP 551650 and EP 298680 disclose specific mixtures of herbicides with safeners, particularly pre-emergence safeners.<br>
It is furthermore known from various publications that herbicides from the series of the benzoylcyclohexanediones as inhibitors of para-hydroxy-phenylpyruvate dioxygenase are based on the same mechanism of action as those from the series of the benzoylisoxazoles, cf. in this context, J. Pesticide Sci. 21, 473-478 (1996), Weed Science 45, 601-609 (1997), Pesticide Science 50, 83-84, (1997) and Pesticide Outlook, 29-32, (December 1996). Moreover, it is known from Pesticide Science 50, 83-84, (1997) that a benzoylisoxazole of the formula (A) can, under certain conditions, undergo rearrangement to give a benzoyl-3-oxopropionitrile of the formula (B).<br><br>
(A)	(B)<br>
However, many of these highly effective active substances are not fully compatible with (i.e. not sufficiently selective in) some important crop plants<br><br>
such as maize, rice or cereals, so that their use is strictly limited. In some crops of useful plants, they can therefore only be employed in such low rates that the desired broad herbicidal activity against weeds is not guaranteed, or not at all. Specifically, a large number of the abovementioned herbicides cannot be employed fully selectively against harmful plants in maize, rice, cereals or some other crops.<br>
To overcome these disadvantages it is known to employ herbicidally active substances in combination with a so-called safener or antidote. A safener is, for the purposes of the invention, a compound or a mixture of compounds which compensates for, or reduces, the phytotoxic properties of a herbicide toward useful plants without essentially reducing the herbicidal action against harmful plants.<br>
Finding a safener for a particular class of herbicides remains a difficult task since the exact mechanisms by which a safener reduces the harmful action of herbicides are not known. The fact that a compound in combination with a particular herbicide acts as a safener therefore allows no conclusions as to whether such a compound would also show a safener action with other classes of herbicides. Thus, when using safeners for protecting the useful plants from adverse effects of herbicides, it has emerged that many of the safeners may still exhibit certain disadvantages. These include:<br>
•	the safener reduces the action of the herbicides against the harmful plants,<br>
•	the useful-plant-protecting properties are not sufficient,<br>
•	in combination with a given herbicide, the spectrum of the useful plants in which the safener/herbicide is to be applied is not sufficiently wide,<br>
•	a given safener cannot always be combined with a sufficiently large number of herbicides.<br>
It was an object of the present invention to find compounds which, in combination with the abovementioned herbicides, are suitable for increasing the selectivity of these herbicides toward important crop plants.<br>
Surprisingly, there has now been found a group of compounds which, together with specific herbicides which act as HPPDO inhibitors increase the selectivity of these herbicides toward important crop plants.<br><br>
The invention therefore relates to a herbicidally active composition comprising a mixture of<br>
A. a herbicidally active amount of one or more compounds of the formula (I)<br><br>

The safeners (antidotes) of the tormuiae {\i) — ^VIIJ ana ine compounas OT group (b), for example safeners of the abovementioned groups a) to h), reduce or prevent phytotoxic effects which may occur when using the herbicidally active substances of the formula (I) in crops of useful plants without substantially affecting the efficacy of these herbicidally active substances against harmful plants. This allows the field of application of conventional crop protection products to be widened quite considerably and to be extended to, for example, crops such as wheat, barley, maize, rice and other crops in which a use of the herbicides was hitherto impossible, or only limited, that is to say at low rates and with a restricted spectrum.<br>
The herbicidally active substances and the abovementioned safeners can be applied together (as a readymix or by the tank mix method) or in succession in any desired sequence. The weight ratio of safener: herbicidally active substance may vary within wide limits and is preferably within the range from 1:100 to 100:1, in particular from 1:10 to 10:1. The optimum amounts of herbicidally active substance and safener in each case depend on the type of the herbicidally active substance used or on the safener used and on the species of the crop stand to be treated and can be determined in each individual case by simple, routine prefiminary experiments.<br>
The main fields of application for the combinations according to the invention are, in particular, maize and cereal crops (for example wheat, rye, barley, oats), rice, sorghum, but also cotton and soybeans, preferably cereals, rice and maize.<br>
Depending on their properties, the safeners employed in accordance with the invention can be used for pretreating the seeds of a crop plant (seed dressing), or be incorporated into the seed furrows prior to sowing or applied together with the herbicide before or after plant emergence. The pre-emergence treatment includes not only the treatment of the area under cultivation prior to sowing and the treatment of the areas under cultivation where the seeds have been planted but the plants have not yet emerged. The joint application with the herbicide is preferred. To this end, tank mixes or readymixes can be employed.<br>
The application rates of safener required may vary within wide limits depending on the indication and the herbicidally active substance used and<br><br>
J<br>
are generally in the range of from 0.001 to 5 kg, preferably 0.005 to 0.5 kg, of active substance per hectare.<br>
The present invention therefore also relates to a method of protecting crop plants from phytotoxic side effects of herbicides of the formula (I), which comprises applying an antidote-effective amount of a compound of the formula (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII) and/or (selected from group (b)) to the plants, the seeds of the plants or the area under cultivation, either before, after or simultaneously with the herbicidally active substance A of the formula (I).<br>
The herbicide/safener combination according to the invention may also be employed for controlling harmful plants in crops of genetically engineered plants which are either known or still to be developed. As a rule, the transgenic plants are distinguished by particular, advantageous properties, for example by resistances to certain crop protection agents, resistances to plant diseases or pathogens causing plant diseases such as particular insects or microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria or viruses. Other particular properties relate for example, to the harvested material in terms of quantity, quality, storing properties, composition and specific constituents. Thus, transgenic plants are known which have an increased starch content or an altered starch quality, or those where the harvested material has a different fatty acid composition.<br>
The use of the combinations according to the invention in economically important transgenic crops of useful plants and ornamentals, for example cereals such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, panic grasses, rice, cassava and maize or else crops of sugar beet, cotton, soya, oilseed rape, potatoes, tomatoes, peas and other types of vegetables.<br>
When the combinations according to the invention are applied in transgenic crops, effects on harmful plants to be observed in other crops are frequently accompanied by effects which are specific for application in the transgenic crop in question, for example an altered or specifically widened weed spectrum which can be controlled, altered application rates which may be used, preferably good compatibility with the herbicides to which the transgenic crop is resistant, and altered growth and yield of the transgenic crop plants.<br><br>
The invention therefore also relates to the use of the combination according to the invention for controlling harmful plants in transgenic crop plants.<br>
The safeners of the formulae (III) - (VII) and of group (b) and their combinations with one or more of the abovementioned herbicidally active substances of the formula (II) can be formulated in various ways, depending on the biological and/or chemico-physical parameters specified. Examples of suitable formulations which are possible are: wettable powders (WP), emulsifiable concentrates (EC), water-soluble powders (SP), water-soluble concentrates (SL), concentrated emulsions (BW) such as oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions, sprayable solutions or emulsions, capsule suspensions (CS), oil- or water-based dispersions (SC), suspoemulsions, suspension concentrates, dusts (DP), oil-miscible solutions (OL), seed treatment products, granules (GR) in the form of microgranules, spray granules, coated granules and adsorption granules, granules for soil application or broadcasting, water-soluble granules (SG), water-dispersible granules (WG), ULV formulations, microcapsules and waxes.<br>
These individual formulation types are known in principle and described, for example, in: Winnacker-Kuchler, "Chemische Technologie" [Chemical Engineering], Volume 7, C. Hauser Verlag Munich, 4th Edition 1986; Wade van Valkenburg, "Pesticide Formulations", Marcel Dekker N.Y., 1973; K. Martens, "Spray Drying Handbook", 3rd Ed. 1979, G. Goodwin Ltd. London.<br>
The formulation auxiliaries which may be required, such as inert materials, surfactants, solvents and other additives are also known and described, for example, in: Watkins, "Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers", 2nd Ed., Darland Books, Caldwell N.J., H.v. Olphen, "Introduction to Clay Colloid Chemistry", 2nd Ed., J. Wiley &amp; Sons, N.Y.; C. Marsden, "Solvents Guide", 2nd'Ed., Interscience, N.Y. 1963; McCutcheon's "Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual", MC Publ. Corp., Ridgewood N.J.; Sisley and Wood, "Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents", Chem. Publ. Co. Inc., N.Y. 1964; Schonfeldt, "Grenzflachenaktive Athylenoxidaddukte" [Surface-active Ethylene Oxide Adducts], Wiss. Verlagsgesell., Stuttgart 1976; Winnacker-Kuchler, "Chemische Technologie" [Chemical Engineering], Volume 7, C. Hauser Verlag Munich, 4th Edition 1986.<br><br>
Based on these formulations, it is also possible to prepare combinations with other substances which act as crop protection agents, such as insecticides, acaricides, herbicides, fungicides, and also with safeners, fertilizers and/or growth regulators, for example in the form of a readymix or as a tank mix.<br>
Wettable powders are preparations which are uniformly dispersible in water and which, besides the active substance, also comprise ionic and/or nonionic surfactants (wetting agents, dispersants), for example polyoxyethylated alkylphenols, polyoxyethylated fatty alcohols, polyoxyethylated fatty amines, fatty alcohol polyglycol ether sulfates, alkanesulfonates, alkylbenzenesulfonates, sodium lignosulfonate, sodium 2,2'-dinaphthylmethane-6,6'-disulfonate, sodium dibutylnaphthalene-sulfonate, or else sodium oieoylmethyltaurinate, in addition to a diluent or inert substance. To prepare the wettable powders, the herbicidally active substances are ground finely, for example in customary apparatus such as hammer mills, blower mills and air-jet mills, and they are simultaneously or subsequently mixed with the formulation auxiliaries.<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates are prepared, for example, by dissolving the active substance in an organic solvent such as butanol, cyclohexanone, dimethylformamide, xylene, or else higher-boiling saturated or unsaturated aliphatic or aromatic, or mixtures of the organic solvents with the addition of one or more ionic and/or nonionic surfactants (emulsifiers). Examples of substances which can be used as emulsifiers are: calcium (C6-C18)-alkylarylsulfonates such as calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, or nonionic emulsifiers such as fatty acid polyglycol esters, (C2-C18)-alkylarylpolyglycol ethers, fatty alcohol polyglycol ethers, propylene oxide/ethylene oxide condensates, alkyl polyethers, sorbitan esters, such as sorbitan fatty acid esters or polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters.<br>
Dusts are generally obtained by grinding the active substance with finely divided solid substances, for example talc, natural clays such as kaolin, bentonite and pyrophyllite, or diatomaceous earth.<br>
Suspension  concentrates  can  be water-  or oil-based.   They  can  be .   prepared, for example, by wet-grinding using commercially available bead<br><br>
mills with or without addition of surfactants, for example those which have already been mentioned above in the case of the other formulation types.<br>
Emulsions, for example oil-in-water emulsions (EW), can be prepared, for example, by means of stirrers, colloid mills and/or static mixers using aqueous organic solvents in the presence or absence of surfactants which have already been mentioned above, for example, in the case of the other formulation types.<br>
Granules can be prepared either by spraying the active substance onto adsorptive, granulated inert material or by applying active substance concentrates to the surface of carriers such as sand, kaolinites or granulated inert material with the aid of binders, for example polyvinyl alcohol, sodium polyacrylate or else mineral oils. Suitable active substances can also be granulated in the manner which is conventional for the preparation of fertilizer granules, if desired as a mixture with fertilizers. As a rule, water-dispersible granules are prepared by the customary processes such as spray-drying, fluidized-bed granulation, disk granulation, mixing with high-speed mixers and extrusion without solid inert material. For the preparation of disk, fluidized-bed, extruder and spray granules see, for example, "Spray-Drying Handbook" 3rd ed. 1979, G. Goodwin Ltd., London; J.E. Browning, "Agglomeration", Chemical and Engineering 1967, pages 147 et seq.; "Perry's Chemical Engineer's Handbook", 5th Ed., McGraw-Hill, New York 1973, pp. 8-57.<br>
For further details in the formulation of crop protection products see, for example, G.C. Klingman, "Weed Control as a Science", John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 1961, pages 81-96 and J.D. Freyer, S.A. Evans, "Weed Control Handbook", 5th Ed., Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, 1968, pages 101-103.<br>
As a rule, the agrochemical formulations comprise 0.1 to 99% by weight, in particular 0.1 to 95% by weight, of active substances of the formulae (II) -(VII) and/or (b) or of the herbicide/antidote mixture of active substances (I) and (II) - (VII) and/or (b) and 1 to 99.9% by weight, in particular 5 to 99.8% by weight, of a solid or liquid additive and 0 to 25% by weight, in particular 0.1 to 25% by weight, of a surfactant.<br><br>
In wettable powders, the active substance concentration is, for example, approximately 10 to 90% by weight, the remainder to 100% by weight being composed of customary formulation components. In the case of emulsifiable concentrates, the active substance concentration is approximately 1 to 80% by weight. Formulations in the form of dusts comprise approximately 1 to 20% by weight of active substance, sprayable solutions approximately 0.2 to 20% by weight of active substance. In the case of granules such as water-dispersible granules, the active substance content depends partly on whether the active compound is in liquid or solid form. The active substance content of the water-dispersible granules is, as a rule, between 10 and 90% by weight.<br>
Besides this, the abovementioned formulations of active substances may comprise, if appropriate, the adhesives, wetters, dispersants, emulsifiers, penetrants, preservatives, antifreeze agents, solvents, fillers, carriers, colorants, antifoams, evaporation inhibitors and pH and viscosity regulators which are customary in each case.<br>

For use, the formulations which are in commercially available form are, if desired, diluted in the customary manner, for example using water in the case of wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates, dispersions and water-dispersible granules. Preparations in the form of dusts, soil granules, granules for broadcasting and sprayable solutions are usually not diluted any further with other inert substances prior to use.<br>
The necessary application rate of the herbicides of the formula (I) varies with the external conditions such as, inter alia, temperature, humidity, and the nature of the herbicide used. It may be varied within wide limits, for example between 0.001 and 10.0 kg/ha or more of herbicide, but it is preferably between 0.005 and 5 kg/ha.<br>

Biological Examples<br>
1.       Greenhouse experiments 1.1      Pre-emergence<br>
Seeds or rhizome pieces of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous harmful plants and useful plants are placed in sandy loam in pots of 9 to 13 cm diameter and covered with soil. As an alternative, for the rice test, rice plants and harmful plants which are undesired in this crop of useful plant, are grown in a waterlogged soil. Various doses of the herbicides and safeners formulated as emulsifiable concentrates or dusts were applied to the surface of the soil cover in the form of aqueous dispersions or suspensions or emulsions at a rate of 300 to 800 I of water/ha (converted), or, in the case of the rice test, poured into the irrigation water. The pots are then kept in the greenhouse under optimal conditions to grow the plants on. 3-4 weeks after the treatment, the damage to useful plants and harmful plants is scored visually. The damage is expressed in percentages in comparison with untreated controls.<br>
The test results are compiled in Tables 5 and 6 (a.i. = active ingredient).<br><br><br>

1.2     Post-emergence<br>
Seeds or rhizome pieces of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous harmful plants and useful plants are placed in sandy loam in pots of 9 to 13 cm diameter and covered with soil. As an alternative, for the rice test, rice plants and harmful plants which are undesired in this crop of useful plants are* grown in a waterlogged soil. In the three-leaf stage, i.e. approximately three weeks after the experiment was set up, various dosages of the herbicides and safeners, formulated as emulsifiable concentrates or dusts, are sprayed in the form of aqueous dispersions or suspensions or emulsions on the green parts of the plant at an application rate of 300 to 800 I of water/ha (converted) or, in the rice test, also poured into the irrigation water. To grow the plants on, the pots are kept in the greenhouse under optimal conditions. The damage to useful plants and harmful plants<br><br>
is assessed visually 2-3 weeks after the treatment. The test results are compiled in Tables 7 to 9.<br><br><br>

2. Field experiments<br>
2 The field experiments were carried out in plots of 8 to 10 m , and each<br>
experiment was carried out in 2 to 4 replications. After the crop plants had<br>
been sown, the test preparations were applied pre-emergence, or in the 2-<br>
6-leaf stage, using plot sprayers. The spray volume was 100 - 300 I<br>
water/ha; it was applied by means of flat-jet nozzles at a pressure of<br>
2-3 bar. Evaluation was done by visual scoring. The effects on the crop<br>
plants or on the broad-leaved weeds/grass weeds were estimated in<br>
comparison   with   untreated   control   plots   using   a   percentage   scale<br>
(0 -100%). After application, the plants were scored 3-4 times at intervals<br>
of approx. 14, 28, 42 days after application. The results represent averages<br>
over 2-4 replications. In general, crop damage in the case of maize is<br>
acceptable  up to  approximately  15%.  Anti-weed  action  should  show<br>
efficacies of &gt; 60%. From sowing until the experiments were concluded,<br>
they  were  exposed   to  the   natural  weather  conditions   (precipitation,<br>
temperature, atmospheric humidity, insolation), as they are characteristic<br>
for the experimental sites.<br>
