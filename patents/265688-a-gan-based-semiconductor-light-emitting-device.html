				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
GaN-BASED SEMICONDUCTOR LIGHT-EMITTING DEVICE, LIGHT<br>
ILLUMINATOR, IMAGE DISPLAY, PLANAR LIGHT SOURCE DEVICE, AND<br>
LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY ASSEMBLY<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device and a light illuminator,<br>
an image display, a planar light source device, and a liquid<br>
crystal display assembly in each of which the GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device is incorporated.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
In a light-emitting device (GaN-based semiconductor<br>
light-emitting device) including an active layer composed of<br>
a gallium nitride (GaN)-based compound semiconductor, the<br>
band-gap energy can be controlled by changing the alloy<br>
composition or thickness of the active layer to realize<br>
emission wavelengths in a wide range from ultraviolet to<br>
infrared. GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting devices<br>
emitting various color lights have already been placed in<br>
the market and used in a wide range of applications such as<br>
image display devices and illuminating devices, inspection<br>
devices, and disinfectant light sources. In addition, blue-<br>
violet semiconductor lasers and light-emitting diodes (LED)<br>
have been developed and used as writing/reading pickups of<br>
large capacity optical discs.<br>
[0003]<br>
It is generally known that in a GaN-based semiconductor<br>
light-emitting device, the emission wavelength shifts to the<br>
short-wavelength side as the driving current (operating<br>
current) is increased. For example, when the driving<br>
current is increased from 20 mA to 100 mA, an emission<br>
wavelength shift of -3 nm in the blue light emitting region<br>
and an emission wavelength shift of -19 nm in the green<br>
light emitting region have been reported (refer to, for<br>
example, the product specification NSPB500S and the product<br>
specification NSPG500S of Nichia Corporation).<br>
[0004]<br>
Such an emission wavelength shift due to an increase in<br>
the driving current (operating current) is a problem common<br>
to active layers composed of GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductors containing In atoms which have a visible<br>
wavelength or longer wavelength. It is thought that carrier<br>
localization due to In atoms within a well layer<br>
constituting an active layer (refer to, for example, Y.<br>
Kawakami, et al., J. Phys. Condens. Matter 13 (2001), pp.<br>
6993) and an internal field effect due to lattice mismatch<br>
(refer to S. P. Chichibu, Materials Science and Engineering<br>
B59 (1999), pp. 298) are concerned in the problem.<br>
[0005]<br>
Further, attempts have been made to control the<br>
emission wavelengths of such GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
devices. For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 2002-237619 discloses a method<br>
for controlling a light color emitted by a light-emitting<br>
diode, in which a plurality of color lights is emitted by<br>
supplying a pulse current having a plurality of peak current<br>
values to a light-emitting diode in which the emission<br>
wavelength is changed by changing the current value. The<br>
method for controlling a light color emitted by a lightemitting<br>
diode is capable of decreasing a size because of<br>
the use of a single emission source and of easily<br>
controlling a luminescent color.<br>
[0006]<br>
For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application<br>
Publication No. 2003-22052 discloses a light-emitting device<br>
driving circuit for driving a plurality of light-emitting<br>
devices to be driven at the same time. The light-emitting<br>
device driving circuit includes emission wavelength<br>
correction means for correcting variations in emission<br>
wavelength between a plurality of light-emitting devices by<br>
controlling the currents supplied to the light-emitting<br>
devices and emission luminance correction means for<br>
correcting variations in emission luminance between a<br>
plurality of light-emitting devices. The light-emitting<br>
device driving circuit is capable of effectively correcting<br>
a variation between light-emitting devices even when the<br>
light-emitting devices have difficulty of uniform emission<br>
due to variations in manufacture of the devices.<br>
[0007]<br>
In a GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device,<br>
various techniques have been proposed for increasing the<br>
efficiency of an active layer having a multi-quantum well<br>
structure including well layers and barrier layers. For<br>
example, PCT Japanese Translation Patent Publication No.<br>
2003-520453 discloses a semiconductor light-emitting device<br>
in which in an active layer having a multi-quantum well<br>
structure including at least two light-emitting active<br>
layers and at least one barrier layer, the light-emitting<br>
active layers or the barrier layer are subjected to chirping.<br>
The term "chirping" means that a plurality of similar layers<br>
is formed so that the thicknesses and/or compositions<br>
thereof are made nonuniform or asymmetric. In this case,<br>
the efficiency of optical output or light generation in each<br>
of the well layers in a LED with a multi-quantum well<br>
structure is increased.<br>
[0008]<br>
More specifically, in paragraph No. [0031] of this<br>
patent application publication, it is disclosed that in a<br>
first example, active layers 48 to 56 of LED 30 are chirped<br>
so that the active layers 48, 50, 52, 54, and 56 have<br>
thicknesses of 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 angstroms,<br>
respectively, in an active region 36. In addition, in<br>
paragraph No. [0032] of this patent application publication,<br>
it is disclosed that in a third example, barrier layers 58<br>
to 64 are chirped so that the thicknesses are between about<br>
10 angstroms and 500 angstroms, and the barrier layer closer<br>
to a n-type lower sealing layer 34 is thicker than the<br>
barrier layer away from the n-type lower sealing layer 34.<br>

Disclosure of Invention<br>
[0010]<br>
A conceivable method as means for increasing the<br>
optical output of a GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting<br>
device includes driving (operating) the GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device with a high driving<br>
current (operating current). However, as described above,<br>
the use of such means causes the problem of shifting the<br>
emission wavelength due to an increase in the driving<br>
current (operating current). Therefore, in a conventional<br>
GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device causing a<br>
large change in emission wavelength according to an<br>
operating current density, a system is generally used, in<br>
which the pulse width (or the pulse density) of the<br>
operating current is changed at a constant operating current<br>
density so as to cause no change in luminescent color when<br>
the luminance is changed.<br>
[0011]<br>
For example, in an image display device in which a GaNbased<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device (light-emitting<br>
diode) having a blue light emission wavelength, a GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device (light-emitting diode)<br>
having a green light emission wavelength, and an AlInGaPbased<br>
compound semiconductor light-emitting diode having a<br>
red light emission wavelength are arranged corresponding to<br>
respective sub-pixels, roughness may occur in a display<br>
image due to a shift of the emission wavelength of each<br>
light-emitting diode. In such an image display device, the<br>
chromaticity coordinates and luminance are controlled<br>
between respective pixels. However, as described above,<br>
when the emission wavelength of each light-emitting device<br>
is shifted to an emission wavelength different from a<br>
desired emission wavelength, there is the problem of<br>
narrowing the color space after control.<br>
[0012]<br>
Further, in a light-emitting device including a GaNbased<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device and a color<br>
conversion material (for example, a light-emitting device<br>
emitting white light by a combination of a ultraviolet or<br>
blue light-emitting diode and fluorescent particles), when<br>
the driving current (operating current) of the GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device is increased for<br>
increasing the luminance (brightness) of the light-emitting<br>
device, the excitation efficiency of the color conversion<br>
material may be. changed due to a shift of the emission<br>
wavelength of the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting<br>
device for exciting the color conversion material, thereby<br>
causing a change in chromaticity and difficult in obtaining<br>
a light-emitting device with a uniform color.<br>
[0013]<br>
Further, a liquid crystal display with a back light<br>
using a GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device has<br>
been proposed. However, in this liquid crystal display,<br>
when the driving current (operating current) of the GaNbased<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device is increased for<br>
increasing the luminance (brightness) of the back light, a<br>
shift of the emission wavelength of the GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device may cause the problem of<br>
narrowing or changing the color space.<br>
[0014] . .<br>
In order to realize a decrease in cost or an increase<br>
in density (increase in definition) of an illuminating<br>
device, a back light, or a display using a GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device, it is necessary to<br>
further decrease the size of the light-emitting device from<br>
a conventional size of 300 ^m square or 1 mm square.<br>
However, in this case, with the same operating current, the<br>
operating current density is increased, thereby resulting in<br>
the problem of shifting the emission wavelength at a high<br>
operating current density. In addition, a display device<br>
including an array of light-emitting micro devices can be<br>
given as an application of GaN-based semiconductor light-<br>
emitting devices. However, in such a light-emitting micro<br>
device, from the viewpoint of application to a display<br>
device, it is important to decrease a shift of the emission<br>
wavelength.<br>
[0015]<br>
The above-described patent application publications<br>
disclose only a calculation example in which the composition<br>
of the barrier layer is changed stepwisely, but do not<br>
specifically disclose asymmetry and effects. Furthermore,<br>
the above-described patent application publications or<br>
documents do not disclose a technique for suppressing a<br>
large shift of the emission wavelength due to an increase in<br>
operating current density.<br>
[0016]<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device<br>
having a structure capable of suppressing a large shift of<br>
the emission wavelength due to an increase in operating<br>
current density and capable of controlling luminance in a<br>
wider range, and a light illuminator, an image display, a<br>
planar light source device, and a liquid crystal display<br>
assembly in each of which the GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
device is incorporated.<br>
[0017]<br>
In order to achieve the object, a GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device of the present invention<br>
includes:<br>
(A) a first GaN-based compound semiconductor layer<br>
having n-type conductivity;<br>
(B) an active layer having a multi-quantum well<br>
structure including well layers and barrier layers for<br>
separating between the well layers; and<br>
(C) a second GaN-based compound semiconductor layer<br>
having p-type conductivity;<br>
wherein the well layers are disposed in the active<br>
layer so as to satisfy the relation di 
well layer density on the first GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer side in the active layer and d2 is the<br>
well layer density on the second GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer side.<br>
[0018]<br>
In order to achieve the object, a light illuminator of<br>
the present invention includes a GaN-based semiconductor<br>
light-emitting device and a color conversion material on<br>
which light emitted from the GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
device is incident and which emits light at a<br>
wavelength different from the wavelength of the light<br>
emitted from GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device,<br>
the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device including:<br>
(A) a first GaN-based compound semiconductor layer<br>
having n-type conductivity;<br>
(B) an active layer having a multi-quantum well<br>
structure including well layers and barrier layers for<br>
separating between the well layers; and<br>
(C) a second GaN-based compound semiconductor layer<br>
having p-type conductivity;<br>
wherein the well layers are disposed in the active<br>
layer so as to satisfy the relation di 
well layer density on the first GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer side in the active layer and d2 is the<br>
well layer density on the second GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer side.<br>
[0019]<br>
In the light illuminator of the present invention, the<br>
light emitted from the GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
device may be visible light, ultraviolet light, or<br>
a combination of visible light and ultraviolet light.<br>
[0020]<br>
In the light illuminator of the present invention, the<br>
light emitted from the GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
device may be blue light, and the light emitted<br>
from the color conversion material may be at lease one type<br>
of light selected from the group consisting of yellow light,<br>
green light, and red light. Specific examples of the color<br>
conversion material excited by the blue light emitted from<br>
the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device to emit<br>
red light include red light-emitting fluorescent particles<br>
and, more specifically, (ME:Eu)S (wherein ME represents at<br>
least one atom selected from the group consisting of Ca, Sr,<br>
and Ba hereinafter), (M:Sm)x (Si, Al)12(0, N) I6 (wherein M<br>
represents at least one atom selected from the group<br>
consisting of Li, Mg, and Ca hereinafter), ME2Si5N8:Eu,<br>
(Ca:Eu)SiN2, and (Ca:Eu)AlSiN3. Specific examples of the<br>
color conversion material excited by the blue light emitted<br>
from the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device to<br>
emit green light include green light-emitting fluorescent<br>
particles and, more specifically, (ME:Eu)Ga2S4, (M:RE)x(Si,<br>
Al)i2(0, N) 16 (wherein RE represents Tb and Yb) , (M:Tb)x(Si,<br>
Al)12(0, N)16, (M:Yb)x(Si, Al)i2(0, N)16, and Si6-zAlzOzN8-z: Eu.<br>
Specific examples of the color conversion material excited<br>
by the blue light emitted from the GaN-based semiconductor<br>
light-emitting device to emit yellow light include yellow<br>
light-emitting fluorescent particles and, more specifically,<br>
YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) fluorescent particles. These<br>
color conversion materials may be used alone or as a mixture<br>
of two or more. When a mixture of two or more color<br>
conversion materials is used, light of a color other than<br>
yellow, green, and red can be emitted from a color<br>
conversion material mixture. Specifically, for example,<br>
light of cyan color may be emitted. In this case, a mixture<br>
of green light-emitting fluorescent particles (e.g.,<br>
LaPO4:Ce, Tb, BaMgAli0Oi7:Eu, Mn, Zn2SiO4:Mn, MgAlu019:Ce, Tb,<br>
Y2Si05:Ce, Tb, MgAluOi9:CE, Tb, or Mn) and blue lightemitting<br>
fluorescent particles (e.g., BaMgAl10O17:Eu,<br>
BaMg2Al16027:Eu, Sr2P2O7:Eu, Sr5 (P04) 3C1: Eu, (Sr, Ca, Ba,<br>
Mg)5(PO4)3Cl:Eu, CaW04, or CaW04:Pb) may be used.<br>
[0021]<br>
When the light emitted from the GaN-based semiconductor<br>
light-emitting device is ultraviolet light, the emission<br>
wavelength is little shifted by an increase in the operating<br>
current density, but improvement in luminous efficiency and<br>
a decrease in threshold current can be expected by<br>
specifying the well layer density. In this case, specific<br>
examples of the color conversion material excited by the<br>
ultraviolet light emitted from the GaN-based semiconductor<br>
light-emitting device to emit red light include red lightemitting<br>
fluorescent particles and, more specifically,<br>
Y203:Eu, YV04:Eu, Y(P, V)04:Eu, 3 . 5MgO- 0 . 5MgF2 • Ge2 :Mn,<br>
CaSiO3:Pb, Mn, Mg6AsOn:Mn, (Sr, Mg) 3 (PO4) 3: Sn, La202S:Eu, and<br>
Y2O2S:Eu. Specific examples of the color conversion material<br>
excited by the ultraviolet light emitted from the GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device to emit green light<br>
include green light-emitting fluorescent particles and, more<br>
specifically, LaP04:Ce, Tb, BaMgAli0O17:Eu, Mn, Zn2SiO4:Mn,<br>
Pig: Ce, Tb, Y2SiO5:Ce, Tb, MgAlnOi9:CE, Tb, Mn, and Si6.<br>
ZA1ZOZN8.Z:EU. Specific examples of the color conversion<br>
material excited by the ultraviolet light emitted from the<br>
GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device to emit blue<br>
light include blue light-emitting fluorescent particles and,<br>
more specifically, BaMgAl10Oi7:Eu, BaMg2Al16O27:Eu, Sr2P2O7:Eu,<br>
Sr5(P04)3Cl:Eu, (Sr, Ca, Ba, Mg) 5 (PO4) 3C1: Eu, CaW04, and<br>
CaWO4:Pb. Specific examples of the color conversion<br>
material excited by the ultraviolet light emitted from the<br>
GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device to emit yellow<br>
light include yellow light-emitting fluorescent particles<br>
and, more specifically, YAG fluorescent particles. These<br>
color conversion materials may be used alone or as a mixture<br>
of two or more. When a mixture of two or more color<br>
conversion materials is used, light of a color other than<br>
yellow, green, and red can be emitted from a color<br>
conversion material mixture. Specifically, for example,<br>
light of cyan color may be emitted. In this case, a mixture<br>
of the above-describe green light-emitting fluorescent<br>
particles and blue light-emitting fluorescent particles may<br>
be used.<br>
[0022]<br>
The color conversion material is not limited to<br>
fluorescent particles, and multicolor high-efficiency<br>
luminescent particles using a quantum effect, for example,<br>
nanometer-size CdSe/ZnS and nanometer size silicon, can be<br>
used. It is known that rare earth atoms added to a<br>
semiconductor material emit sharp light by intranuclear<br>
transition, and luminescent particles using this technique<br>
can also be used.<br>
[0023]<br>
In the light illuminator of the present invention<br>
including the above-described preferred constitution, white<br>
light may be emitted by mixing the light emitted from the<br>
GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device and the light<br>
emitted from the color conversion material (for example,<br>
yellow, red and green, yellow and red, or green, yellow, and<br>
red). However, the present invention is not limited to this<br>
and can be applied to color-changeable illumination and<br>
display.<br>
[0024]<br>
In order to achieve the object, an image display device<br>
according to a first embodiment of the present invention<br>
includes a GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device for<br>
display an image, the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting<br>
device including:<br>
(A) a first GaN-based compound semiconductor layer<br>
having n-type conductivity;<br>
(B) an active layer having a multi-quantum well<br>
structure including well layers and a barrier layer for<br>
separating between the well layers; and<br>
 (C) a second GaN-based compound semiconductor layer<br>
having p-type conductivity;<br>
wherein the well layers are disposed in the active<br>
layer so as to satisfy the relation di 
well layer density on the first GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer side in the active layer and d2 is the<br>
well layer density on the second GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer side.<br>

be described below. Unless otherwise specified, the number<br>

The planar light source device of the present invention<br>
or the planar light source device in the liquid crystal<br>
display assembly of the present invention may include two<br>
types of planar light source devices (back light), i.e., a<br>
direct-lighting type planar light source device disclosed in,<br>
for example, Japanese Unexamined Utility Model Registration<br>
Application Publication No. 63-187120 and Japanese<br>
Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2002-277870,<br>
and an edge light-type (also referred to as a "side light<br>
type") planar light source device disclosed in, for example,<br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2002-<br>
131552. The number of GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
devices is basically arbitrary and may be<br>
determined on the basis of the specifications required for<br>
the planar light source device.<br>
[0035]<br>
In the direct-lighting type planar light source device,<br>
the first, second, and third light-emitting devices are<br>
opposed to a liquid crystal display device, and a diffusion<br>
plate, a diffusion sheet, a prism sheet, an optical<br>
functional sheet group such as a polarization conversion<br>
sheet, or a reflection sheet is disposed between the light<br>
crystal display device and the first, second, and third<br>
light-emitting devices.<br>
[0036]<br>
More specifically, in the direct-lighting type planar<br>
light source device, a red (for example, wavelength 640 nm)<br>
light-emitting semiconductor light-emitting device, a green<br>
(for example, wavelength 530 nm) light-emitting GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device, and a blue (for example,<br>
wavelength 450 nm) light-emitting GaN-based semiconductor<br>
light-emitting device may be arranged in a casing. However,<br>
the planar light source device is not limited to this, when<br>
a plurality of red light-emitting semiconductor lightemitting<br>
devices, a plurality of green light-emitting GaNbased<br>
semiconductor light-emitting devices, and a plurality<br>
of blue light-emitting GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
devices are arranged in a casing, an example of the<br>
arrangement of these light-emitting devices is an<br>
arrangement in which a plurality of light-emitting device<br>
lines each including a group of a red light-emitting<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device, a green light-emitting<br>
GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device, and a blue<br>
light-emitting GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device<br>
is arrayed in the horizontal direction of the screen of the<br>
light crystal display device to form a light-emitting device<br>
line array, and a plurality of the light-emitting device<br>
line arrays is arrayed in the vertical direction of the<br>
screen of the liquid crystal display device. Examples of<br>
the light-emitting device line include several combinations<br>
such as (one red light-emitting semiconductor light-emitting<br>
device, one green light-emitting GaN-based semiconductor<br>
light-emitting device, and one blue light-emitting GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device); (one red lightemitting<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device, two green<br>
light-emitting GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting<br>
devices, and one blue light-emitting GaN-based semiconductor<br>
light-emitting device); and (two red light-emitting<br>
semiconductor light-emitting devices, two green lightemitting<br>
GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting devices, and<br>
one blue light-emitting GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
device). Furthermore, a light-emitting device<br>
emitting light of a fourth color other than red, green, and<br>
blue may be further provided. A GaN-based semiconductor<br>
light-emitting device may be provided with a light<br>
extraction lens described in Nikkei Electronics, December 20,<br>
2004, No. 889, p. 128.<br>
[0037]<br>
On the other hand, in the edge light-type planar light<br>
source device, a light guide plate is opposed to the liquid<br>
crystal display device, and a GaN-based semiconductor light<br>
emitting device is disposed on a side (first side described<br>
below) of the light guide plate. The light guide plate has<br>
a first surface (bottom), a second surface (top) opposite to<br>
the first surface, the first side, a second side, a third<br>
side opposite to the first side, and a fourth side opposite<br>
to the second side. A specific example of the shape of the<br>
light guide plate is a wedge-shaped truncated quadrangular<br>
pyramid shape as a whole. In this case, the two opposing<br>
sides of the truncated quadrangular prism correspond to the<br>
first and second surfaces, and the bottom of the truncated<br>
quadrangular prism corresponds to the first side.<br>
Furthermore, projections and/or recesses are preferably<br>
provided on the surface of the first surface (bottom). In<br>
this case, light is incident on the first side of the light<br>
guide plate, and light is emitted from the second surface<br>
(top) toward the liquid crystal display device. The second<br>
surface of the light guide plate may be smooth (i.e., a<br>
mirror surface) or may be provided with blast crimps having<br>
a diffusion effect (i.e., a fine irregular surface).<br>
[0038]<br>
In addition, projection and/or recesses are preferably<br>
provided on the first surface (bottom) of the light guide<br>
plate. Namely, projections, recesses, or unevenness is<br>
preferably provided on the first surface (bottom) of the<br>
light guide plate. When unevenness is provided, recesses<br>
and projections may be continuous or discontinuous. The<br>
projections and/or recesses provided on the first surface of<br>
the light guide plate may include continuous projections<br>
and/or recesses extending in a direction at a predetermined<br>
angle with the incidence direction of the light guide plate.<br>
In this structure, examples of a sectional shape of the<br>
continuous projections or recesses of the light guide plate<br>
taken along a virtual plane vertical to the first surface in<br>
the incidence direction of the light guide plate include a<br>
triangle; any desired quadrangles including a square, a<br>
rectangle, and a trapezoid; any desired polygons; and any<br>
desired smooth curves including a circle, an ellipse, a<br>
parabola, a hyperbola, and a catenary. The direction at a<br>
predetermined angle with the incidence direction of the<br>
light guide plate means the direction at 60° to 120° with<br>
respect to 0° of the incidence direction of the light guide<br>
plate. This applies to the description below.<br>
Alternatively, the projections and/or recesses provided on<br>
the first surface of the light guide plate may include<br>
discontinuous projections and/or recesses extending in a<br>
direction at a predetermined angle with the incidence<br>
direction of the light guide plate. Examples of the shape<br>
of the discontinuous projections and/or recesses include a<br>
pyramid, a cone, a cylinder, polygon poles such as a<br>
triangle pole and a square pole, and various smoothly curved<br>
surfaces such as a part of a sphere, a part of a spheroid of<br>
revolution, a part of a paraboloid of revolution, and a part<br>
of hyperboloid of revolution. In the light guide plate, the<br>
projections or recesses may not be formed in the periphery<br>
of the first surface according to circumstances. Further,<br>
light emitted from the light source and incident on the<br>
light guide plate is scattered by collision with the<br>
projection or recess formed on the first surface of the<br>
light guide plate. However, the height, depth, pitch, or<br>
shape of the projections or recesses provided on the first<br>
surface of the light guide plate may be made constant or<br>
changed away from the light source. In the latter case, for<br>
example, the pitch of the projections or recesses may be<br>
decreased away from the light source. The pitch of the<br>
projections or recesses means the pitch of the projection or<br>
recess along the incidence direction of the light guide<br>
plate.<br>
[0039]<br>
In the planar light source device provided with the<br>
light guide plate, a reflective member is preferably<br>
disposed opposite to the first surface of the light guide<br>
plate. The liquid crystal display device is disposed<br>
opposite to the second surface of the light guide plate.<br>
Light emitted from the light source is incident on the first<br>
side (for example, corresponding to the bottom of a<br>
truncated quadrangular pyramid) of the light guide plate,<br>
scattered by collision with the projections or recesses of<br>
the first surface, emitted from the first surface, reflected<br>
by the reflective member, again incident on the first<br>
surface, and emitted from the second surface to illuminate<br>
the liquid crystal display device. For example, a diffusion<br>
sheet or a prism sheet may be disposed between the liquid<br>
crystal display device and the second surface of the light<br>
guide plate. The light emitted from the light source may be<br>
guided directly to the light guide plate or guided<br>
indirectly to the.light guide plate. In the latter case,<br>
for example, an optical fiber may be used.<br>
[0040]<br>
The light guide plate is preferably formed using a<br>
material which little absorbs light emitted from the light<br>
source. Examples of the material constituting the light<br>
guide plate include glass and plastic materials (e.g., PMMA,<br>
polycarbonate resins, acrylic resins, amorphous<br>
polypropylene resins, and styrene resins including AS<br>
resins).<br>
[0041]<br>
For example, a transmissive color liquid crystal<br>
display device includes a front panel with a transparent<br>
first electrode, a rear panel with a transparent second<br>
electrode, and a liquid crystal material disposed between<br>
the front panel'and the rear panel.<br>
[0042]<br>
More specifically, the front panel includes a first<br>
substrate including, for example, a glass substrate or a<br>
silicon substrate, the transparent first electrode (also<br>
referred to as the "common electrode" and composed of ITO)<br>
provided on the inner surface of the first substrate, and a<br>
polarizing film provided on the outer surface of the first<br>
substrate. The front panel further includes a color filter<br>
provided on the inner surface of the first substrate and<br>
covered with an overcoat layer composed of an acrylic resin<br>
or an epoxy resin, the transparent first electrode being<br>
formed on the overcoat layer. Further, an alignment film is<br>
formed on the transparent first electrode. Examples of the<br>
arrangement pattern of the color filter include a delta<br>
arrangement, a stripe arrangement, a diagonal arrangement,<br>
and a rectangle arrangement. On the other hand, more<br>
specifically, the rear panel includes a second substrate<br>
including, for example, a glass substrate or a silicon<br>
substrate, a switching element and the transparent second<br>
electrode (also referred to as the "pixel electrode" and<br>
composed of ITO), which are provided on the inner surface of<br>
the second substrate so that conduction/non-conduction of<br>
the transparent second electrode is controlled by the<br>
switching element, and a polarizing film provided on the<br>
outer surface of the second substrate. Further, an<br>
alignment film is'formed over the entire surface including<br>
the transparent second electrode. The members and the<br>
liquid crystal material which constitute the transmissive<br>
color liquid crystal display device may be known members and<br>
material. Examples of the switching element include threeterminal<br>
elements such as a MOS-type FET and thin film<br>
transistor (TFT) formed on a single crystal silicon<br>
semiconductor substrate, and two-terminal elements such as a<br>
MIM element, a varistor element, and a diode.<br>

operating current density is 30 A/cm2, and 13 (nm) is the<br>
emission wavelength of the active layer when the operating<br>
current density is 300 A/cm2.<br>
[0044]<br>
Alternatively, in the present invention with the abovedescribed<br>
preferred constitutions, it is preferred to<br>
satisfy the following relations:<br>
430 (rim) 
0 
wherein \2 (nm) is the emission wavelength of the active<br>
layer when the operating current density is 30 A/cm2, and X3<br>
{nm) is the emission wavelength of the active layer when the<br>
operating current density is 300 A/cm2. Alternatively, it<br>
is preferred to satisfy the following relations:<br>
430 {nm) 
0 
0 
wherein ^ {nm) is the emission wavelength of the active<br>
layer when the operating current density is 1 A/cm2, X2 {nm)<br>
is the emission wavelength of the active layer when the<br>
operating current density is 30 A/cm2, and ^3 (nm) is the<br>
emission wavelength of the active layer when the operating<br>
current density is 300 A/cm2.<br>
[0045]<br>
In a semiconductor light-emitting device, the emission<br>
wavelength is generally changed by generation of heat or a<br>
temperature change in characteristic measurement. Therefore,<br>
in the present invention, characteristics at about room<br>
temperature (25°C) are taken into consideration. When a<br>
GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device generates a<br>
small quantity of heat, no problem occurs in driving with a<br>
DC current. However, when a large quantity of heat is<br>
generated, it is necessary to employ a measurement method<br>
such as driving with a pulse current, in which the<br>
temperature of a GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting<br>
device (temperature of a junction region) is not<br>
significantly changed from room temperature.<br>
[0046]<br>
With respect to the emission wavelength, the wavelength<br>
of a power peak in a spectrum is taken into consideration.<br>
A spectrum in which human visual performance is taken into<br>
consideration, or a dominant wavelength usually used for<br>
expressing a color is not employed. Furthermore, a spectrum<br>
with apparent periodic variations, which are caused by many<br>
times of reflection of light emitted from an active layer<br>
due to thin film interference, may be observed according to<br>
measurement conditions. Therefore, a spectrum of light<br>
produced in an active layer and not containing such periodic<br>
variations is used.<br>
[0047]<br>
The operating current density of a GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device is a value obtained by<br>
dividing the operating current by the active layer area<br>
(area of a junction region). Namely, commercially available<br>
GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting devices have various<br>
package forms and different sizes depending on applications<br>
and quantities of light. In addition, the standard driving<br>
current (operating current) varies according to the size of<br>
the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device.<br>
Therefore, it is difficult to directly compare current<br>
dependencies of characteristics. In the present invention,<br>
for the purpose of generalization, the driving current is<br>
not used, but the expression "operating current density"<br>
(unit: ampere/cm2) obtained by dividing the driving current<br>
by the active layer area (area of a junction region) is used.<br>
[0048]<br>
In the present invention, in order to change the well<br>
layer density, the thicknesses of the barrier layers are<br>
preferably changed (specifically, in the active layer, the<br>
thickness of the barrier layer on the second GaN-based<br>
compound semiconductor layer side is smaller than that of<br>
the barrier layer on the first GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer side) while the well layer thicknesses<br>
are constant. However, the present invention is not limited<br>
to this. The thicknesses of the well layers may be changed<br>
(specifically, in the active layer, the thickness of the<br>
well layer on the second GaN-based compound semiconductor<br>
layer side is larger than that of the well layer on the<br>
first GaN-based compound semiconductor layer side) while the<br>
barrier layer thickness is constant, or the thicknesses of<br>
both the well layer and the barrier layer may be changed.<br>
[0049]<br>
In the present invention, the well layer density di and<br>
the well layer density d2 are defined as follows: When the<br>
active layer with a total thickness t0 is divided two parts<br>
in the thickness direction, the thickness of an active layer<br>
first region ARi on the first GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer side is expressed by ti, and the<br>
thickness of an active layer second region AR2 on the second<br>
GaN-based compound semiconductor layer side is expressed by<br>
t2 (t0 = ti + t2) . In addition, the number of the well<br>
layers contained in the active layer first region ARi is<br>
expressed by WLX (a positive number and not limited to an<br>
integer), and the number of the well layers contained in the<br>
active layer second region AR2 is expressed by WL2 (a<br>
positive number and not limited to an integer, and total<br>
number WL of well layers = WLi + WL2) . When a well layer<br>
(thickness tIF) is present over the active layer first region<br>
ARi and the active layer second region AR2, the number of the<br>
well layers contained in only the active layer first region<br>
ARi is expressed by WIV, and the number of the well layers<br>
contained in only the active layer second region AR2 is<br>
expressed by WL2' , and in-the well layer (thickness tjF)<br>
present over the active layer first region ARi and the<br>
active layer second region AR2/ the thickness contained in<br>
the active layer first region ARi is expressed by tiF_i, and<br>
the thickness contained in the active layer second region<br>
AR2 is expressed by tIF-2 (tIF = tiF_i + tiF-2) • In this case,<br>
the following equations are established:<br>
WLi = WL1! + AWLi<br>
WL2 = WL'2 + AWL2<br>
wherein<br>
AWLi + AWL2 = 1<br>
WL = Win + WL2<br>
! + WL'2 + 1<br>
AWL2 =<br>
[0050]<br>
The well layer density di and the well layer density d2<br>
can be determined by the following equations (1-1) and (1-2)<br>
wherein k = (t0/WL) :<br>
[0051]<br>
dj. = (WLi/WL)/(ti/t0)<br>
= k(WLi/ti) (1-D<br>
d2 = (WL2/WL)/(t2/t0)<br>
= k(WL2/t2) (1-2)<br>
[0052]<br>
In the present invention, when the total thickness of<br>
the active layer is t0, the well layer density in the active<br>
layer first region ARi ranging from the first GaN-based<br>
compound semiconductor layer-side interface to the thickness<br>
of (2to/3) in the active layer is di, and the well layer<br>
density in the active layer second region AR2 ranging from<br>
the second GaN-based compound semiconductor layer-side<br>
interface to the thickness of (t0/3) in the active layer is<br>
d2, the well layers may be disposed in the active layer to<br>
satisfy the relation dx 
thickness of the active layer is t0, the well layer density<br>
in the active layer first region ARX ranging from the first<br>
GaN-based compound semiconductor layer-side interface to the<br>
thickness of (t0/2) in the active layer is di, and the well<br>
layer density in the active layer second region AR2 ranging<br>
from the second GaN-based compound semiconductor layer-side<br>

layer density in the active layer second region AR2 ranging<br>
from the second GaN-based compound semiconductor layer-side<br>
interface to the thickness of (2t0/3) in the active layer is<br>
d2/ the well layers may be disposed in the active layer to<br>
satisfy the relation di 
[0053]<br>
In the present invention with the above-described<br>
various preferred forms and constitutions, the well layers<br>
are preferably disposed in the active layer to satisfy the<br>
relation 1 
preferably 1.5 
by forming barrier layers with uniform thicknesses.<br>
Specifically, the thicknesses of the barrier layers in the<br>
active layer are changed from the first GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer side to the first GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer side (for example, changed in multiple<br>
steps or three or more steps). More specifically, a<br>
structure may be used, in which the thicknesses of the<br>
barrier layers in the active layer are decreased stepwisely<br>
from the first GaN-based compound semiconductor layer side<br>
to the first GaN-based compound semiconductor layer side.<br>
[0054]<br>
Alternatively, in the present invention with the abovedescribed<br>
various preferred forms and constitutions, the<br>
thicknesses of the barrier layers in the active layer are<br>
preferably changed, for example, stepwisely so that the<br>
thickness of the barrier layer nearest the second GaN-based<br>
compound semiconductor layer is preferably 20 nm or less, or<br>
the thickness of the barrier layer nearest the first GaN-<br>
based compound semiconductor layer is twice or more the<br>
thickness of the barrier layer nearest the second GaN-based<br>
compound semiconductor layer.<br>
[0055]<br>
Further, in the present invention with the abovedescribed<br>
various preferred forms and constitutions, the<br>
active layer may contain indium atoms and, more specifically,<br>
the composition AlxGai-x-yInyN (wherein x &gt; 0, y &gt; 0, and 0 
+ y 
semiconductor layer and the second GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer include a GaN layer, an AlGaN layer, an<br>
InGaN layer, and AlInGaN layer. These compound<br>
semiconductor layers may further contain boron (B) atoms,<br>
thallium (Tl) atoms, arsenic (As) atoms, phosphorus (P)<br>
atoms, or antimony (Sb) atoms.<br>
[0056]<br>
Further, in the present invention with the abovedescribed<br>
various preferred forms and constitutions, the<br>
number (WL) of the well layers in the active layer is 2 or<br>
more and preferably 4 or more.<br>
[0057]<br>
Further, in the present invention with the abovedescribed<br>
various preferred forms and constitutions, the<br>
GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device may further<br>
include:<br>
 (D) an underlying layer containing In atoms and formed<br>
between the first GaN-based compound semiconductor layer and<br>
the active layer; and<br>
(E) a superlattice layer containing a p-type dopant and<br>
formed between the active layer and the second GaN-based<br>
compound semiconductor layer.<br>
In this constitution, the more stable operation of the GaNbased<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device can be achieved at<br>
a high operating current density while further improving the<br>
luminous efficiency and further decreasing the operating<br>
voltage.<br>
[0058]<br>
In this constitution, an undoped GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer is preferably formed between the active<br>
layer and the superlattice layer, the thickness of the<br>
undoped GaN-based compound semiconductor layer being 100 nm<br>
or less. The total thickness of the superlattice layer is<br>
preferably 5 nm or more, and the period of a superlattice<br>
structure in the superlattice layer is preferably 2-atom<br>
layer to 20 nm. In addition, the concentration of the ptype<br>
dopant contained in the superlattice layer is<br>
preferably 1 x 1018/cm3 to 4 x 1020/cm3. Alternatively, the<br>
thickness of the underlying layer is 20 nm or more, and an<br>
undoped GaN-based compound semiconductor layer is preferably<br>
formed between the underlying layer and the active layer,<br>
the thickness of the undoped GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer being 50 nm or less. Further, the<br>
underlying layer and the active layer may contain In, and<br>
the In ratio in the underlying layer is 0.005 or more which<br>
is lower than that in the active layer. The underlying<br>
layer may contain 1 x 1016/cm3 to 1 x 1021/cm3 of n-type<br>
dopant.<br>
[0059]<br>
The GaN-based compound semiconductor layer constituting<br>
the active layer is preferably composed of an undoped GaNbased<br>
compound semiconductor or the n-type impurity<br>
concentration of the GaN-based compound semiconductor layer<br>
constituting the active layer is preferably less than 2 x<br>
1017/cm3.<br>
[0060]<br>
Further, in the present invention with the abovedescribed<br>
various preferred forms and constitutions, the<br>
length of the short side (when the active layer has a<br>
rectangular planar shape) or the short diameter (when the<br>
active layer has a circular or elliptic planar shape) of the<br>
active layer is 0.1 mm or less and preferably 0.03 mm or<br>
less. When the active layer has a planar shape such as a<br>
polygon or the like in which the short side or short<br>
diameter cannot be defined, the diameter of a circle<br>
estimated to have the same area as that of the active layer<br>
is defined as the short diameter. In the GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device of the present invention,<br>
a shift of the emission wavelength, particularly, at a high<br>
operating current density is decreased. However, in a GaNbased<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device of a smaller size,<br>
the effect of decreasing a shift of the emission wavelength<br>
is significant. Therefore, when the present invention is<br>
applied to a GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device<br>
of a smaller size than that of a conventional GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device, it is possible to<br>
realize a high-density (high-definition) GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device at a low cost and an<br>
image display device using the light-emitting device.<br>
[0061]<br>
For example, when a 32-inch high-definition television<br>
receiver (1920 x 1080 x RGB) generally used as a home<br>
television receiver is realized by arranging such GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting devices in a matrix, the size<br>
of one pixel including a combination of a red light-emitting<br>
device, a green light-emitting device, and blue lightemitting<br>
device corresponding to sub-pixels is about 360-jam<br>
square, and each sub-pixel essentially has a long side<br>
length of 300 and a short side length of 100 fxm.<br>
Alternatively, for example, in a projection-type display in<br>
which such GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting devices<br>
are arranged in a matrix for projection through a lens, like<br>
in a conventional projection-type liquid crystal display<br>
device or DMD light valve, a size of 1 inch or less is<br>
preferred from the viewpoint of optical design and cost.<br>
Even in a three-plate type using a dichroic prism, in order<br>
to realize DVD of 1 inch in diagonal length with a general<br>
resolution of 720 x 480, the required size of a GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device is 30 ju,m or less. In<br>
this way, when the short side (short diameter) is 0.1 mm or<br>
less and more preferably 0.03 mm or less, an emission<br>
wavelength shift in a region with the dimensions can be<br>
significantly decreased as compared with a conventional GaNbased<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device, thereby widening<br>
a practical application range and causing high usefulness.<br>
[0062]<br>
In the present invention with the above-described<br>
various preferred forms and constitutions, as a method for<br>
forming various GaN-based compound semiconductor layers such<br>
as the first GaN-based compound semiconductor layer, the<br>
active layer, and the second GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer, a metalorganic chemical vapor<br>
deposition method (MOCVD method), a MBE method, or a hydride<br>
vapor deposition method in which halogen contributes to<br>
transport or reaction can be used.<br>
[0063]<br>
In the MOCVD method, trimethyl gallium (TMG) gas or<br>
triethyl gallium (TEG) gas can be used as an organic gallium<br>
source gas, and ammonia gas or hydrazine gas can be used as<br>
a nitrogen source gas. In forming the first GaN-based<br>
compound semiconductor layer having n-type conductivity, for<br>
example, silicon (Si) may be added as a n-type impurity (ntype<br>
dopant). In forming the second GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer having p-type conductivity, for example,<br>
magnesium (Mg) may be added as a p-type impurity (p-type<br>
dopant). When a GaN-based compound semiconductor layer<br>
contains aluminum (Al) or indium (In) as a constituent atom,<br>
trimethylaluminum (TMA) gas may be used as an Al source or<br>
trimethylindium (TMI) gas may be used as an In source. In<br>
addition, monosilane gas (SiH4 gas) may be used as a Si<br>
source, and cyclopentadienyl magnesium gas,<br>
methylcyclopentadienyl magnesium, or biscyclopentadienyl<br>
magnesium (Cp2Mg) may be used as a Mg source. Examples of<br>
the n-type impurity (n-type dopant) other than Si include Ge,<br>
Se, Sn, C, and Ti. Examples of the p-type impurity (p-type<br>
dopant) other than Mg include Zn, Cd, Be, Ca, Ba, and 0.<br>
[0064]<br>
A p-type electrode connected to the second GaN-based<br>
compound semiconductor layer having p-type conductivity<br>
preferably has a single-layer or multi-layer structure<br>
containing at least one metal selected from the group<br>
consisting of palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), nickel (Ni), Al<br>
(aluminum), Ti (titanium), gold (Au), and silver (Ag). A<br>
transparent conductive material such as ITO (Indium Tin<br>
Oxide) may be used. In particular, silver (Ag), Ag/Ni, or<br>
Ag/Ni/Pt, which can reflect light with high efficiency, is<br>
preferably used. A n-type electrode connected to the first<br>
GaN-based compound semiconductor layer having n-type<br>
conductivity preferably has a single-layer or multi-layer<br>
structure containing at least one metal selected from the<br>
group consisting of gold (Au), silver (Ag), palladium (Pd),<br>
Al (aluminum), Ti (titanium), tungsten (W), Cu (copper), Zn<br>
(zinc), tin (Sn), and indium (In). For example, Ti/Au,<br>
Ti/Al, or Ti/Pt/Au can be used. The n-type electrode and<br>
the p-type electrode can be formed by a PVD method such as<br>
vacuum evaporation or sputtering.<br>
[0065]<br>
Further, a pad electrode may be provided on each of the<br>
n-type electrode and the p-type electrode, for electrically<br>
connecting the electrode to an external electrode or circuit,<br>
The pad electrode preferably has a single-layer or multilayer<br>
structure containing at least one metal selected from<br>
the group consisting of Ti (titanium), Al (aluminum), Pt<br>
(platinum), Au (gold), and Ni (nickel). The pad electrode<br>
may have a multilayer structure, for example, a Ti/Pt/Au<br>
multilayer structure or a Ti/Au multilayer structure.<br>
 [0066]<br>
In the present invention with the above-described<br>
preferred forms and constitutions, an assembly of a GaNbased<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device may have a face-up<br>
structure or a flip-chip structure.<br>
[0067]<br>
In the present invention, the quantity of light<br>
(luminance) emitted from a GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
device can be controlled by controlling the pulse<br>
width of the driving current, the pulse density of the<br>
driving current, or combination of both, in addition to the<br>
control of the peak current value of the driving current.<br>
This is because a change in the peak current value of the<br>
driving current slightly affects the emission wavelength of<br>
a GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device.<br>
[0068]<br>
Specifically, for example, in one type of GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device, the peak current of a<br>
driving current for a certain emission wavelength A,0 is<br>
expressed by I0, and the pulse width of the driving current<br>
is expressed by P0. In a GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
device or a light illuminator, an image display<br>
device, a planar light source device, or a liquid crystal<br>
display assembly, in which the GaN-based semiconductor<br>
light-emitting device is incorporated, the one-operation<br>
period of the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device<br>
is expressed by T0p. In this case, a control method<br>
includes:<br>
(1) controlling (adjusting) the peak current value I0 of<br>
the driving current to control the quantity of light<br>
(luminance) emitted from the GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
device; and<br>
(2) controlling the pulse width P0 of the driving<br>
current (pulse width control of driving current) to control<br>
the quantity of light (brightness or luminance) emitted from<br>
the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device; and/or<br>
(3) controlling the number of pulses (pulse density)<br>
with the pulse width P0 in the one-operation period T0p of<br>
the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device (pulse<br>
density control of driving current) to control the quantity<br>
of light (brightness or luminance) emitted from the GaNbased<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device.<br>
[0069]<br>
The above-described control of the quantity of light<br>
emitted from the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting<br>
device can be achieved by a driving circuit for the GaNbased<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device, the driving<br>
circuit including:<br>
(a) pulse driving current supply means for supplying a<br>
pulse driving current to the GaN-based semiconductor light-<br>
emitting device;<br>
(b) pulse driving current setting means for setting the<br>
pulse width and pulse density of the driving current; and<br>
(c) means for setting the peak current value.<br>
The driving current can be applied to not only the GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device of the present invention<br>
characterized by the well layer density but also a<br>
conventional GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device.<br>
[0070]<br>
The GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device of<br>
the present invention can be exemplified by a light-emitting<br>
diode (LED) and a semiconductor laser (LD). The structure<br>
and constitution of the GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
device are not particularly limited as long as the<br>
multilayer structure thereof has a light-emitting diode<br>
structure or laser structure. Besides the above-described<br>
light-emitting device, image display device, planar light<br>
source device, and liquid crystal display assembly including<br>
a color liquid crystal display assembly, the application<br>
field of the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device<br>
of the present invention includes lamp fittings and lamps<br>
for transport means such as automobiles, electric railcars,<br>
ships, and aircrafts (e.g., headlights, tail lights, highmount<br>
stop lights, small lights, turn signal lights, fog<br>
lights, room lamps, meter-panel lights, light sources<br>
provided in various buttons, destination lamps, emergency<br>
lamps, and emergency exit guide lights); various lamp<br>
fittings and lamps in buildings (e.g., outdoor lights, room<br>
lamps, lightings, emergency lights, and emergency exit guide<br>
lights); various indicating lamp fittings of street lights,<br>
traffic signals, advertising displays, machines, and<br>
apparatuses; lightings and lighting parts in tunnels and<br>
underground passages; special illuminations in various<br>
inspection devices such as biological microscopes;<br>
sterilizers using light; deodorizing sterilizers combined<br>
with optical catalysts; exposure devices for photographs and<br>
semiconductor lithography; and devices for modulating light<br>
to transmit information through spaces, optical fibers, or<br>
waveguides.<br>
[0071]<br>
In the present invention, the well layers are disposed<br>
in the active layer so as to satisfy the relation di 
wherein di is the well layer density on the first GaN-based<br>
compound semiconductor layer side in the active layer and d2<br>
is the well layer density on the second GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer side. Therefore, it is possible to<br>
suppress a large shift of the emission wavelength due to an<br>
increase in the operating current density while improving<br>
the luminous efficiency. As a result of experiments<br>
conducted by the inventors, it was found that in a GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device, a well layer<br>
contributing light emission is gradually shifted to a well<br>
layer on the second GaN-based compound semiconductor layer<br>
side as the operating current density increases. A possible<br>
cause is a difference in mobility between electrons and<br>
holes. It is thought that since holes have low mobility in<br>
a GaN-based compound semiconductor, holes reach only a well<br>
layer near the second GaN-based compound semiconductor layer,<br>
and thus light emission due to recombination of holes and<br>
electrons is localized on the second GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer side. In addition, with respect to the<br>
carrier transmittance of a hetero-barrier including a well<br>
layer and a barrier layer, another possible cause is that<br>
holes with large effective mass have difficulty in reaching<br>
a well layer on the first GaN-based compound semiconductor<br>
layer side through a plurality of barrier layers. Namely,<br>
in the present invention, a large number of well layers are<br>
present in a range (the second GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer side) where holes can reach. For<br>
example, since the thickness of the barrier layer on the<br>
first GaN-based compound semiconductor layer side in the<br>
active layer is larger than that of the barrier layer on the<br>
second GaN-based compound semiconductor layer side in the<br>
active layer, the transmittance of holes is improved to<br>
facilitate uniform distribution of holes. As a cause of a<br>
shift of the emission wavelength to the short wavelength<br>
side due to an increase in the operating current density in<br>
a GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device, "band<br>
filling of localized level" and "screening of piezo-electric<br>
field" accompanying an increase in carrier concentration in<br>
a well layer have been proposed. However, holes are<br>
effectively distributed to improve the recombination<br>
probability, and holes are uniformly distributed to decrease<br>
the carrier concentration per well layer, thereby possibly<br>
decreasing a shift of the emission wavelength to the short<br>
wavelength side.<br>
[0072]<br>
Therefore, even when the driving current (operating<br>
current) of a GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device<br>
is increased for increasing the optical output of the GaNbased<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device, the problem of<br>
causing a shift of the emission wavelength due to an<br>
increase in the driving current (operating current) can be<br>
prevented. In particular, when the operating current<br>
density in a blue light-emitting or green light-emitting<br>
GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device is increased<br>
to 30 A/cm2 or further increased to 50 A/cm2 or 100 A/cm2 or<br>
more, a larger effect (increasing luminance and decreasing a<br>
shift of the emission wavelength to the short wavelength<br>
side) can be obtained. In the present invention, since<br>
light emission from well layers localized in a specified<br>
region of the active layer is effectively used, a higher<br>
efficiency can be realized by a synergistic effect with a<br>
light extraction technique having a high optical resonator<br>
effect, and an improvement in characteristics of a<br>
semiconductor layer can be expected.<br>
[0073]<br>
In the image display device, the planar light source<br>
device, or the liquid crystal display assembly including a<br>
color liquid crystal display assembly, the pulse width<br>
and/or the pulse density of the driving current is<br>
controlled, and the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting<br>
device is driven at a high peak current of the driving<br>
current (operating current) to increase optical output,<br>
thereby increasing luminance while decreasing a shift of the<br>
emission wavelength, i.e., in the state where the emission<br>
wavelength is not much changed due to a change in the<br>
driving current (operating current). In other words, the<br>
luminance can be controlled by controlling the pulse width<br>
and/or the pulse density of the driving current and<br>
controlling the peak current of the driving current<br>
(operating current). Therefore, the number of control<br>
parameters of luminance is increased in comparison to a<br>
conventional technique, thereby permitting luminance control<br>
in a wider range. Namely, a wide dynamic range of luminance<br>
can be obtained. Specifically, for example, the luminance<br>
of the whole device may be controlled by controlling the<br>
peak current of the driving current (operating current), and<br>
the luminance may be finely controlled by controlling the<br>
pulse width and/or the pulse density of the driving current.<br>
In contrast, the luminance of the whole device may be<br>
controlled by controlling the pulse width and/or the pulse<br>
density of the driving current, and the luminance may be<br>
finely controlled by controlling the peak current of the<br>
driving current (operating current). Since a light-emitting<br>
device causes a small shift of the emission wavelength of<br>
the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device, stable<br>
chromaticity can be realized regardless of the current value,<br>
In particular, this control is useful for a white light<br>
source including a combination of a blue or near-ultraviolet<br>
GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device and a color<br>
conversion material.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0076]<br>
The characteristics of a GaN-bfcsed light-emitting diode<br>
were preliminarily examined prior tp description of the<br>
present invention on the basis of examples with reference to<br>
the drawings.<br>
[0077]<br>
Namely, a GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device<br>
(reference product 0) including an active layer having nine<br>
well layers and eight barrier layer^ was produced. The GaNbased<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device has a structure<br>
shown in a conceptual view of Fig. fL in which a buffer layer<br>
11 (thickness 30 nm) ; an undoped GaJN layer 12 (thickness 1<br>
jam) ; a first GaN-based compound semiconductor layer 13 with<br>
n-type conductivity (thickness 3 jam) ; an undoped GaN layer<br>
14 (thickness 5 nm); an active layer 15 having a multi-<br>
quantum well structure including well layers and burrier<br>
layers for separating between the well layers (the well<br>
layers and the burrier layers are not shown in the drawing);<br>
an undoped GaN layer 16 (thickness 10 nm); a second GaNbased<br>
compound semiconductor layer 17 with p-type<br>
conductivity (thickness 20 nm); and a Mg-doped GaN layer<br>
(contact layer) 18 (thickness 100 nm) are stacked in order.<br>
In some drawings, the buffer layer 11, the undoped GaNlayer<br>
12, the undoped GaN layer 14, the undoped GaN layer 16,<br>
and the Mg-doped GaN layer 18 are not shown. The undoped<br>
GaN layer 14 is provided for improving the crystallinity of<br>
the active layer 15 formed thereon by crystal growth, and<br>
the undoped GaN layer 16 is provided for preventing a dopant<br>
(for example, Mg)-in the second GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer 17 from diffusing into the active layer<br>
15. In the active layer 15, each well layer is an InGaN<br>
(Ino.23Gao.77N) layer having a thickness of 3 nm and an In<br>
ratio of 0.23, and each barrier layer is a GaN layer having<br>
a thickness of 15 nm. The well layers with such a<br>
composition may be referred to as "composition-A well<br>
layers".<br>
[0078]<br>
In the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device<br>
(reference product-0), at an operating current density of 60<br>
A/cm2, the emission peak wavelength was 515 nm, and the<br>
luminous efficiency was 180 mW/A. Like a commercial LED,<br>
when the light-emitting device is mounted on a highreflectivity<br>
mount and subjected to resin molding with high<br>
refractive index,-an efficiency of about two times or more<br>
can be obtained in total luminous flux measurement.<br>
[0079]<br>
Next, a GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device<br>
with a similar layer structure was produced, in which the In<br>
composition ratio of only a specified layer of the nine well<br>
layers was adjusted, i.e., a well layer (may be referred to<br>
as composition-B well layer for the convenience 'sake) of<br>
InGaN (Ino.i5Ga0.85N) having a thickness of 3 nm and an In<br>
ratio of 0.15 was provided, and the other eight layers were<br>
composition-A well layers. A GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
device' in which the first well layer from the first<br>
GaN-based compound semiconductor layer side is a<br>
composition-B well layer is referred to as a "reference<br>
product-1"; a GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device<br>
in which the third well layer is a composition-B well layer<br>
is referred to as a "reference product-2"; a GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device in which the fifth well<br>
layer is a composition-B well layer is referred to as a<br>
"reference product-3"; a GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
device in which the seventh well layer is a<br>
composition-B well layer is referred to as a "reference<br>
product-4"; and a GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting<br>
device in which the ninth well layer is a composition-B well<br>
layer is referred to as a "reference product-5". In each of<br>
the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device of<br>
reference products-1 to 5, the other well layers were<br>
composition-A well layers as described above.<br>
[0080]<br>
The purpose of this experiment is that when light is<br>
emitted from a green light-emitting GaN-based semiconductor<br>
light-emitting device (light-emitting diode) having nine<br>
well layers, the luminous ratios of the well layers are<br>
visualized.<br>
[0081]<br>
In each of the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting<br>
devices of the reference products-1 to 5, at an operating<br>
current density of 60 A/cm2, the emission peak wavelength<br>
was 515 nm, and the luminous efficiency was 180 mW/A.<br>
However, some reference products, a small emission peak was<br>
observed in a blue emission region (emission wavelength:<br>
about 450 nm) other than green emission (emission<br>
wavelength: about 515 nm) due to the composition-B well<br>
layers. The ratios of the blue, emission peak component to<br>
the whole are plotted in Fig. 36. In Fig. 36, the first<br>
layer, the third layer, ... inn the abscissa show positions<br>
of the composition-B well layers from the first GaN-based<br>
compound semiconductor layer side. Namely, the data of the<br>
ratio of the blue emission peak component to the whole<br>
corresponding to the Qth layer (Q = 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9)<br>
indicates the data of the ratio of the blue emission peak<br>
component of the Qth well layer to the whole for each<br>
operating current density in the GaN-based semiconductor<br>
light-emitting device having the composition-B well layers.<br>
[0082]<br>
It is necessary to pay attention to the point that<br>
green emission (emission wavelength: about 515 nm) and blue<br>
emission (emission wavelength: about 450 nm) are different<br>
in band gap energy by 350 meV, and the typical decay times<br>
are different (for example, in Fig. 6 of S. F. Chichibu, et<br>
al., Materials Science &amp; Engineering B59(1999), p.298, the<br>
emission decay time of LED having an In composition ratio of<br>
0.15 (blue light emission) is 6 nanoseconds, while the<br>
emission decay time of LED having an In composition ratio of<br>
0.22 (green light emission) is 9 nanoseconds). However, the<br>
method of experimentally showing an emission distribution as<br>
shown in Fig. 36 is a noneonventiona1 method.<br>
[0083]<br>
As shown in Fig. 36, at any operating current density,<br>
emission is localized in a region of about 2/3 of the active<br>
layer in the thickness direction on the second GaN-based<br>
compound semiconductor layer side of the active layer having<br>
a multi-quantum well structure. In addition, 80% of<br>
emission is caused in a region of 1/2 in the thickness<br>
direction of the active layer on the second GaN-based<br>
compound semiconductor layer side. A possible cause of<br>
significant localization of emission is a difference in<br>
mobility between electrons and holes, as described in PCT<br>
Japanese Translation Patent Publication No. 2003-520453.<br>
Since holes have low mobility in a GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor, holes reach only the well layers near the<br>
second GaN-based compound semiconductor layer, and thus<br>
emission due to recombination of holes and electrons is<br>
possibly localized on the second GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer side. In addition, with respect to<br>
carrier transmittance of a hetero barrier layer including<br>
well layers and barrier layers, another possible cause is<br>
that holes with a large effective mass have difficulty in<br>
reaching well layers on the first GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer side through a plurality of barrier<br>
layers.<br>
[0084]<br>
Therefore, in order to effectively utilize emission<br>
localized on the second GaN-based compound semiconductor<br>
layer side, a multi-quantum well structure with a well layer<br>
asymmetric distribution which is localized on the second<br>
GaN-based compound semiconductor layer side can be proposed.<br>
Further, it is found that the emission distribution has a<br>
peak in a region of 1/3 to 1/4 of the active layer in the<br>
thickness direction on the second GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer side. It is also found that as in a<br>
semiconductor layer or a light-emitting diode using an<br>
optical resonator effect (refer to, for example, Y. C. Shen,<br>
et al., Applied Physics Letters, vol. 82 (2003), p. 2221),<br>
in order to realize higher-efficiency induced emission or<br>
light extraction by concentrating well layers serving as<br>
luminescent layers in a specified narrow region, it is<br>
preferred to use a multi-quantum well structure in which the<br>
well layer distribution is localized in a region of about<br>
1/3 of the active layer in the thickness direction on the<br>
second GaN-based compound semiconductor layer side.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
[0085]<br>
Example 1 relates to a GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
device of the present invention and, more<br>
specifically, a light-emitting diode (LED). Fig. 1 is a<br>
conceptual view of a layer structure, and Fig. 2 is a<br>
schematic sectional view. A GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
device 1 of Example 1 has the same layer<br>
constitution and structure as the reference product-0 except<br>
the constitution and structure of the active layer 15.<br>
[0086]<br>
The GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device 1 is<br>
fixed to a sub-mount 21 and electrically connected to an<br>
outer electrode 23B through wiring (not shown) and gold<br>
wires 23A provided on the sub-mount 21, the outer electrode<br>
23B being electrically connected to a driving circuit 26.<br>
The sub-mount 21 is attached to a reflector cup 24 which is<br>
provided on a heat sink 25. Further, a plastic lens 22 is<br>
disposed above the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting<br>
device 1, and the space between the plastic lens 22 and the<br>
GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device 1 is filled<br>
with a light-transmitting medium layer (not shown) for light<br>
emitted from the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting<br>
device 1, for example, a transparent epoxy resin (refractive<br>
index: for example, 1.5), a gelatinous material (e.g., trade<br>
name OCK-451 (refractive index: 1.51) or trade name OCK-433<br>
(refractive index: 1.46) of Nye Lubricants Inc.), silicone<br>
rubber, or an oil compound material such as silicone oil<br>
compound (e.g., trade name TSK5353 (refractive index: 1.45)<br>
of Toshiba Silicone Co., Ltd.).<br>
[0087]<br>
In addition, the well layers are disposed in the active<br>
layer 15 so as to satisfy the relation di 
the well layer density on the first GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer side in the active layer 15 and d2 is<br>
the well layer density on the second GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer side. Details of a multi-quantum well<br>
structure of the active layer 15 are shown in Table 1 below.<br>
In Table 1 and Tables 2 and 3 given below, a numeral in<br>
parentheses at the right of the thickness of each of the<br>
well layers and barrier layers represents the integrated<br>
thickness from the first GaN-based compound semiconductor<br>
layer-side interface in the active layer 15 (more<br>
specifically, the interface between the undoped GaN layer 14<br>
and the active layer 15 in Example 1).<br>
[0088]<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 [0089]<br>
In Example 1, when the total thickness of the active<br>
layer 15 is t0, the well layer density in an active layer<br>
first region ARi ranging from the first GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer-side interface (more specifically, the<br>
interface between the undoped GaN layer 14 and the active<br>
layer 15 in Example 1) to the thickness of (2t0/3) in the<br>
active layer 15 is di, and the well layer density in an<br>
active layer second region AR2 ranging from the second GaNbased<br>
compound semiconductor layer-side interface (more<br>
specifically, the interface between the undoped GaN layer 16<br>
and the active layer 15 in Example 1) to the thickness of<br>
(t0/3) is d2, the well layers are disposed in the active<br>
layer 15 to satisfy the relation di 
[0090]<br>
Specifically, the well layer density di and the well<br>
layer density d2 are determined from the equations (1-1) and<br>
(1-2) as follows:<br>
[0091]<br>
[Example 1]<br>
d2 = (WL2/WL)/(t2/t0)<br>
= (4/10)/(50/150)<br>
= 1.20<br>
di = (WLi/WL)/(ti/t0)<br>
=(6/10)/(100/150)<br>
- 78 -<br>
= 0.90<br>
[0092]<br>
For comparison, a GaN-based semiconductor light -<br>
emitting device including an active layer shown as<br>
Comparative Example 1 in Table 1 was produced.<br>
[0093]<br>
In each of the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting<br>
devices of Example 1 and Comparative Example 1, in order to<br>
evaluate and simplify the manufacture process, the first<br>
GaN-based compound semiconductor layer 13 with n-type<br>
conductivity was partially exposed on the basis of a<br>
lithography process and an etching process, a p-type<br>
electrode 19B composed of Ag/Ni was formed on the Mg-doped<br>
GaN layer 18, and a n-type electrode 19A composed of Ti/Al<br>
was formed on the first GaN-based compound semiconductor<br>
layer 13. Then, probe tips were brought into contact with<br>
the n-type electrode 19A and the p-type electrode 19B, and a<br>
driving current was supplied to detect light emitted from<br>
the back of the substrate 10. This state is shown in a<br>
conceptual view of Fig. 5. Fig. 6A is a schematic top view<br>
of the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device 1, and<br>
Fig. 6B is a schematic sectional view (in which oblique<br>
lines are omitted) taken along arrows B-B in Fig. 6A. The<br>
operating current density of a GaN-based semiconductor<br>
light-emitting device is a value obtained by dividing the<br>
operating current by the area of an active layer (area of a<br>
junction region). For example, when the active layer area<br>
(area of a junction region) of the GaN-based semiconductor<br>
light-emitting device 1 shown in Figs. 6A and 6B is 6 x 10"4<br>
cm2, and the driving current is 20 mA, the operating current<br>
density is calculated at 33 A/cm2. For example, even in a<br>
state in which the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting<br>
devices are connected in series as shown in Fig. 7, the<br>
operating current density is calculated at 33 A/cm2.<br>
[0094]<br>
The well layer density di and the well layer density d2<br>
in Comparative Example 1 are determined from the equations<br>
(1-1) and (1-2) as follows:<br>
[0095]<br>
[Comparative Example 1]<br>
d2 = (WL2/WL)/(t2/t0)<br>
= ( ( 3 + l/3)/10}/(49/147)<br>
= 1.00<br>
dx = (WL1/WL)/(t1 / t 0 )<br>
= {(6 + 2/3)}/10}/(98/147)<br>
= 1.00<br>
[0096]<br>
Fig. 3 shows the results of measurement of a<br>
relationship between the operating current density and<br>
optical output of a GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting<br>
device. The optical output of the GaN-based semiconductor<br>
light-emitting device 1 of Example 1 more increases than in<br>
Comparative Example 1 corresponding to a conventional GaNbased<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device. The difference<br>
in optical output between the GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
devices of Example 1 and Comparative Example 1<br>
becomes significant at an operating current density of 50<br>
A/cm2 or more and is 10% or more at an operating current<br>
density of 100 A/cm2 or more. Namely, since the optical<br>
output of the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device<br>
1 of Example 1 more increases than in a conventional GaNbased<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device at an operating<br>
current density of 50 A/cm2 or more and preferably 100 A/cm2<br>
or more, the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device 1<br>
is preferably used at an operating current density of 50<br>
A/cm2 or more and more preferably 100 A/cm2 or more.<br>
[0097]<br>
Further, Fig. 4 shows a relationship between the<br>
operating current density and emission peak wavelength of a<br>
GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device. When the<br>
operating current density is increased from 0.1 A/cm2 to 300<br>
A/cm2, in Comparative Example 1, AX = -19 nm, while in<br>
Example 1, AA, =. -8 nm, and thus a small emission wavelength<br>
shift is realized. In particular, at an operating current<br>
density of 30 A/cm2 or more, substantially no wavelength<br>
shift is observed. In other words, since the emission<br>
wavelength is little changed at an operating current density<br>
of 30 A/cm2 or more, the operating current density is<br>
preferred from the viewpoint of control of the emission<br>
wavelength and luminous color. In particular, at an<br>
operating current density of 50 A/cm2 or more, further 100<br>
A/cm2 or more, the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting<br>
device 1 of Example 1 causes a significantly smaller<br>
wavelength shift than that of a conventional GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device of Comparative Example 1,<br>
and is thus apparently superior to the conventional GaNbased<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device.<br>
[0098]<br>
In order to theoretically prove the effect, band<br>
diagrams of Example 1 and Comparative Example 1 were<br>
calculated. The compositions and doping concentrations were<br>
as described below in [Step-100] to [Step-140], and the ntype<br>
impurity concentration in the active layer was 1 x<br>
1017/cm3. In addition, an outer bias was 3 volts.<br>
[0099]<br>
The diagrams and Fermi levels near the active layers of<br>
Example 1 and Comparative Example 1, which were determined<br>
by calculation, are shown in Figs. 8 and 9, respectively.<br>
In any one of Example 1 and Comparative Example 1, the<br>
active layer includes ten well layers and is characterized<br>
by band inclination (diagonally right down) due to a piezo<br>
electric field in the well layers and large band bending<br>
(diagonally right up) before and after the well layers. The<br>
difference between Example 1 and Comparative Example 1<br>
appears in the envelopes thereof. In Comparative Example 1<br>
in which the well layers are uniformly distributed, the<br>
envelope is gently diagonally right down, while in Example 1,<br>
the envelope is greatly bend at a portion (about 1/3 from<br>
the interface between the active layer and the first GaNbased<br>
compound semiconductor layer) where the barrier layer<br>
is changed in thickness.<br>
[0100]<br>
On the basis of these results, hole concentrations in<br>
Example 1 and Comparative Example 1 were calculated. The<br>
results are shown in Figs. 10 and 11. These figures<br>
indicate that in Comparative Example 1, holes are<br>
distributed up to only the third well layer from the<br>
interface of the second GaN-based compound semiconductor<br>
layer, while in Example 1, the hole concentrations in all<br>
well layers are higher than in Comparative Example 1, and<br>
holes are distributed up to the ninth layer from the<br>
interface of the second GaN-based compound semiconductor<br>
layer. As described above, the hole concentration<br>
distribution in Comparative Example 1 is possibly due to the<br>
fact that holes reach only the vicinity of the interface of<br>
the second GaN-based compound semiconductor layer because of<br>
the mobility and effective mass of holes. In Example 1,<br>
holes can be distributed to many well layers and distributed<br>
to the well layer away from the interface of the second GaNbased<br>
compound semiconductor layer. This possibly results<br>
in improvement in the output and a decrease in the emission<br>
wavelength shift of the light-emitting device.<br>
[0101] -<br>
By using the same calculation, hole concentrations were<br>
calculated at various n-type impurity concentrations in the<br>
active layer of the structure of Example 1. The results are<br>
shown in Fig. 12. At a n-type impurity concentration of 5 x<br>
1016/cm3, holes are distributed to a small number of well<br>
layers, but distributed to four well layers at<br>
concentrations of 100 times or more higher than those at a<br>
n-type impurity concentration of 1 x I017/cm3. On the other<br>
hand, at a n-type impurity concentration of 2 x 1017/cm3 or<br>
more, holes reach only two or three layers near the<br>
interface of the second GaN-based compound semiconductor<br>
layer, and the hole concentrations are also low. Therefore,<br>
preferably, the n-type impurity concentration is less than 2<br>
x 1017/cm3 or the active layer is undoped. The active layer<br>
may be partially doped by delta doping, not uniformly doped.<br>
In this case, the average n-type impurity concentration in<br>
the whole active layer is preferably less than 2 x 1017/cm3.<br>
 [0102]<br>
A GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device having<br>
the structure shown in the right column of Table 1 was<br>
produced as a modified example of Example 1. In the<br>
modified example-A of Example 1, the thickness of the first<br>
barrier layer was twice, i.e., 50 nm. In addition, the<br>
number of the well layers and the number of the barrier<br>
layers were decreased by 1 each to control the total<br>
thickness of the active layer. Broadly, in the structure,<br>
the thicknesses of the barrier layers decrease stepwisely.<br>
[0103]<br>
The results of calculation of holes concentrations in<br>
Example 1 and modified example-A of Example 1 are shown in<br>
Figs. 13 and 14. In Example 1, holes are distributed at<br>
high concentrations in a larger number of well layers than<br>
that in Comparative Example 1, but a high hole concentration<br>
is observed in only one well layer. On the other hand, in<br>
modified example-A of Example 1, a higher hole concentration<br>
is observed in two well layers, thereby causing higher<br>
usefulness for improving the luminous efficiency and<br>
decreasing the emission wavelength shift.<br>
[0104]<br>
Table 2 shows the structures of modified examples of<br>
Example 1 (modified example-B and modified example-C of<br>
Example 1) in which the number of well layers is 4, and the<br>
structure of Comparative Example 1-A. The band diagram and<br>
Fermi levels near the active layers in modified example-B<br>
and modified example-C of Example 1 and Comparative Example<br>
1-A, which were determined by calculation, are shown in Figs,<br>
ISA, 16A, and 17A, respectively. The results of calculation<br>
of hole concentrations are shown in Figs. 15B, 16B, and 17B.<br>
In modified example-B of Example 1, the hole concentration<br>
of the rightmost well layer (nearest the interface of the<br>
second GaN-based compound semiconductor layer) shown in Fig.<br>
15B is lower than that in Comparative Example 1-A, but the<br>
holes concentrations of the other well layers are higher<br>
than those in Comparative Example 1-A. In particular, the<br>
central two well layers have very high hole concentrations.<br>
In modified example-C of Example 1, the hole concentration<br>
of the rightmost well layer (nearest the interface of the<br>
second GaN-based compound semiconductor layer) shown in Fig.<br>
16B is equivalent to that in Comparative Example 1-A, and<br>
the concentrations of holes distributed in the other well<br>
layers are higher•than those in Comparative Example 1-A.<br>
Therefore, it is thought that these examples are effective<br>
in improving the luminous efficiency and decreasing the<br>
emission wavelength shift.<br>
[0105]<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 [0106]<br>
Therefore, in the GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
device, the hole concentration distribution can be<br>
variously changed by changing the well layer distribution in<br>
the active layer having a multi-quantum well structure. In<br>
the present invention, the effect of improving luminous<br>
efficiency and decreasing the emission wavelength shift is<br>
exhibited in the visible region from blue to green of the<br>
GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device. However,<br>
even in the blue-violet (wavelength: about 400 nm) region in<br>
which the emission wavelength shift is basically small, the<br>
present invention is effective in improving luminous<br>
efficiency. Further, in the ultraviolet (wavelength: 365 nm<br>
or less) region of an AlGaN system having a higher piezo<br>
electric field, the present invention is effective in<br>
decreasing the emission wavelength shift and improving<br>
luminous efficiency.<br>
 [0107]<br>
In addition to the method using the peak current value<br>
I0 of the driving current, the quantity of light (luminance)<br>
emitted from the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting<br>
device may be controlled by controlling the pulse width of<br>
the driving current, the pulse density of the driving<br>
current, or combination of both. In the examples described<br>
below, the quantity of light (luminance) emitted from the<br>
GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device may be<br>
controlled by the same method.<br>
[0108]<br>
When the total thickness of the active layer 15 is t0,<br>

well layer density in the active layer second region AR2<br>

between the undoped GaN layer 16 and the active layer 15) to<br>
the thickness of (t0/2) is d2, the well layers are disposed<br>
in the active layer 15 to satisfy the relation di 
this case, the well layer density di and the well layer<br>
density d2 are determined from the equations (1-1) and (1-2)<br>
as follows:<br>
[0109]<br>
[Example 1 equivalent]<br>
d2 = (WL2/WL)/(t2 / t 0 )<br>
= (6/10)7(75/150)<br>
= 1.20<br>
dx = (WL1/WL)/(t1/ t0)<br>
= (4/10)/(75/150)<br>
= 0 . 80<br>
[0110]<br>
[Comparative Example 1 equivalent]<br>
d2 = (WLa/WL)/ (t2/t0)<br>
= (5/10)/{ (73 + l/2)/147}<br>
= 1.00<br>
di = (WLi/WL)/(ti/tp)<br>
= (5/10)/{ (73 +<br>
= 1.00<br>
[0111]<br>
When the total thickness of the active layer 15 is t0,<br>
the well layer density in an active layer first region ARi<br>
ranging from the first GaN-based compound semiconductor<br>
layer-side interface (more specifically, the interface<br>

the thickness of (t0/3) in the active layer 15 is dl7 and the<br>
well layer density in an active layer second region AR2<br>
ranging from the second GaN-based compound semiconductor<br>
layer-side interface (more specifically, the interface<br>
between the undoped GaN layer 16 and the active layer 15) to<br>
the thickness of (2t0/3) is d2, the well layers are disposed<br>
in the active layer 15 to satisfy the relation dx 
this case, the well layer density di and the well layer<br>
density d2 are determined from the equations (1-1) and (1-2)<br>
as follows:<br>
[0112]<br>
[Example 1 equivalent]<br>
d2 = (WL2/WL)/(t2/t0)<br>
= (8/10)/(50/150)<br>
= 2.40<br>
di = (WLi/WL)/(ti/t0)<br>
= (2/10)/(100/150)<br>
= 0.30<br>
[0113]<br>
[Comparative Example 1 equivalent]<br>
d2 = (WL2/WL)/(t2/ t0)<br>

di = (WL1/WL)/(t1 / t 0 )<br>
= { (3 + l/3)/10}/{49/147)<br>
= 1.00<br>
[0114]<br>
As described above, in any case corresponding to<br>
Example 1, the well layers are disposed in the active layer<br>
15 so as to satisfy the relation di  d2.<br>
[0115]<br>
In Example 1, as shown in Fig. 2, the driving circuit<br>
26 includes a control part 27, a driving current source 28<br>
serving as a supply source of the driving current, a pulse<br>
generator circuit 29 for generating predetermined pulse<br>
signals, and a driver 30. The driving current source 28,<br>
the pulse generator circuit 29, and the driver 30 correspond<br>
to pulse driving current supply means for supplying a pulse<br>
driving current to the GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
device. The control part 27 corresponds to pulse<br>
driving current setting means for setting the pulse width<br>
and pulse density of the pulse driving current and<br>
corresponds means for setting the peak current value.<br>
[0116]<br>
In the driving circuit 26, the peak current value I0 of<br>
the driving current is output from the driving current<br>
source 28 under control by the control part 27. In addition,<br>
a pulse signal is-output from the pulse generator circuit 29<br>
in order to control the pulse width P0 of the GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device 1 and the number of<br>
pulses (pulse density) having the pulse width P0 in the oneoperation<br>
period T0p of the GaN-based semiconductor light-<br>
emitting device 1 under control by the control part 27. In<br>
the driver 30 receiving the driving current and the pulse<br>
signal, the driving current supplied from the driving<br>
current source 28 is pulse-modulated on the basis of the<br>
pulse signal output from the pulse generator circuit 29 to<br>
supply the pulse driving current to the GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device 1. Therefore, the<br>
quantity of light emitted from the GaN-based semiconductor<br>
light-emitting device 1 is controlled.<br>
[0117]<br>
The summary of the method for manufacturing the GaNbased<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device 1 of Example 1<br>
will be described below.<br>
[0118]<br>
[Step-100]<br>
First, sapphire with a C plane as a main plane is used<br>
as the substrate 10, cleaned in a hydrogen carrier gas at a<br>
substrate temperature of 1050°C for 10 minutes, and then<br>
cooled to a substrate temperature of 500°C. Then, on the<br>
basis of a MOCVD process, trimethylgallium (TMG) gas is<br>
supplied as a gallium source under the supply of ammonia gas<br>
as a nitrogen raw material to deposit the buffer layer 11<br>
composed of low-temperature GaN and 30 nm in thickness by<br>
crystal growth on the substrate 10. Then, the supply of TMG<br>
gas is stopped.<br>
 [0119]<br>
[Step-110]<br>
Next, the substrate temperature is increased to 1020°C,<br>
and then the supply of TMG gas is again started to form the<br>
undoped GaN layer 12 having a thickness of 1 urn by crystal<br>
growth on the buffer layer 11. Then the supply of<br>
monosilane (SiH4) gas as a silicon raw material is started<br>
to form the first GaN-based compound semiconductor layer 13<br>
composed of Si-doped GaN (GaN:Si) and having n-type<br>
conductivity and a thickness of 3 )nm by crystal growth on<br>
the undoped GaN layer 12. The doping concentration is about<br>
5 x 1018/cm3.<br>
[0120]<br>
[Step-120]<br>
Then, the supply of TMG gas and SiH4 gas is stopped, and<br>
the carrier gas is changed from hydrogen gas to nitrogen gas,<br>
and, at the same time, the substrate temperature is<br>
decreased to 750°C. Then, triethylgallium (TEG) gas used as<br>
a Ga source and trimethylindium (TMI) gas used as an In<br>
source are supplied by valve switching. First, the undoped<br>
GaN layer 14 having a thickness of 5 nm is formed by crystal<br>
growth, then the active layer 15 having a multi-quantum well<br>
structure including a well layer composed of undoped or<br>
doped InGaN with a n-type impurity concentration of less<br>
than 2 x I017/cm3 and a barrier layer composed of undoped or<br>
doped GaN with a n-type impurity concentration of less than<br>
2 x 1017/cm3 is formed. The well layer has an In composition<br>
ratio of, for example, 0.23 corresponding to an emission<br>
wavelength A, of 515 nm. The In composition ratio of the<br>
well layer may be determined on the basis of the desired<br>
emission wavelength. Details of the multi-quantum well<br>
structure are as shown in Table 1 for example.<br>
[0121]<br>
[Step-130]<br>
After the formation of the multi-quantum well structure<br>
is completed, the substrate temperature is increased to<br>
800°C while the undoped GaN layer 16 of 10 nm is grown. The<br>
supply of trimethylaluminum (TMA) gas used as an Al raw<br>
material and biscyclopentadienyl magnesium (Cp2Mg) gas used<br>
as a Mg raw material is started to form, by crystal growth,<br>
the second GaN-based compound semiconductor layer 17 having<br>
p-type conductivity and a.thickness of 20 nm and composed of<br>
Mg-doped AlGaN (AlGaN:Mg) with an Al composition ratio of<br>
0.20. The doping concentration is about 5 x 1019/cm3.<br>
[0122]<br>
[Step-140]<br>
Then, the supply of TEG gas, TMA gas, and Cp2Mg gas is<br>
stopped, and the carrier gas is changed from nitrogen gas to<br>
hydrogen gas, and, at the same time, the substrate<br>
temperature is increased to 850°C. Then, the supply of TMG<br>
as and Cp2Mg gas is started to form the Mg-doped GaN layer<br>
(GaN:Mg) 18 having a thickness of 100 nm by crystal growth<br>
on the second GaN-based compound semiconductor layer 17.<br>
The doping concentration is about 5 x 1019/cm3. Then, the<br>
supply of TMG gas and Cp2Mg gas is stopped and, at the same<br>
time, the substrate temperature is decreased. At a<br>
substrate temperature of 600°C, the supply of ammonia gas is<br>
stopped. The substrate temperature is decreased to room<br>
temperature to complete crystal growth.<br>
[0123]<br>
The substrate temperature TMAX after the growth of the<br>
active layer 15 satisfies the relation TMAX 
(°C) and preferably TMAX 
is the emission wavelength. By using such a substrate<br>
temperature TMAX after the growth of the active layer 15,<br>
thermal deterioration of the active layer 15 can be<br>
suppressed as disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 2002-319702.<br>
[0124]<br>
After the crystal growth is completed, the substrate is<br>
annealed in a nitrogen gas atmosphere at 800°C for 10<br>
minutes to activate the p-type impurity (p-type dopant).<br>
Then, like in a usual LED wafer process and chip forming<br>
process, the substrate is cut into chips by dicing after a<br>
photolithography process and an etching process, and a step<br>
of forming a p-type electrode and a n-type electrode by<br>
metal evaporation. Further, resin molding and packaging are<br>
performed to form various light-emitting diodes such as a<br>
shell type and a surface mounting type.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
[0125]<br>
Example 2 is a modification of Example 1. In a GaNbased<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device of Example 2, an<br>
underlying layer containing In atoms is formed between the<br>
first GaN-based compound semiconductor layer 13 and the<br>
active layer 15 (more specifically, the first GaN-based<br>
compound semiconductor layer 13 and the undoped GaN layer 14<br>
in Example 2). In addition, a superlattice layer containing<br>
a p-type dopant is formed between the active layer 15 and<br>
the second GaN-based compound semiconductor layer 17 (more<br>
specifically, the undoped GaN layer 16 and the second GaNbased<br>
compound semiconductor layer 17 in Example 2). In<br>
this structure, a more stable operation of the GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device can be achieved at a<br>
high operating current density while further improving the<br>
luminous efficiency and further decreasing the operating<br>
voltage.<br>
[0126]<br>
The underlying layer is a Si-doped InGaN layer having<br>
an In composition ratio of 0.03 and a thickness of 150 nm.<br>
The doping concentration is 5 x I018/cm3. on the other hand,<br>
the superlattice layer has a superlattice structure in which<br>
an AlGaN layer (Mg-doped) with a thickness of 2.4 nm and a<br>
GaN layer (Mg-doped) with a thickness of 1.6 nm are stacked<br>
in five cycles. The Al composition ratio of the AlGaN layer<br>
is 0.15. The concentration of the p-type dopant contained<br>
in the superlattice layer is 5 x 1019/cm3.<br>
[0127]<br>
Except these points, the GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
device of Example 2 has the same constitution and<br>
structure as those of Example 1, and thus detailed<br>
description is omitted. The constitution and structure of<br>
the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device of Example<br>
2 can be applied to GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting<br>
devices of Examples 3 and 4 which will be described below.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
[0128]<br>
Example 3 is a modification of Example 1. Table 3<br>
below shows details of a multi-quantum well structure of an<br>
active layer 15 in a GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting<br>
device of Example 3. In Example 3 and Comparative Example 3,<br>
the In composition ratio of a well layer is controlled so<br>
that the emission wavelength is about 445 nm.<br>
[0129]<br>
[Table 3]<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 [0130]<br>
The well layer density di and the well layer density d2<br>
are determined from the equations (1-1) and (1-2) as<br>
follows:<br>
[0131]<br>
[Example 3]<br>
d2 = (WL2/WL)/(t2/to)<br>
= { (5 + 2/9)/10}/{ (40 + 2/3)/122}<br>
= 1.57<br>
di = (WLi/WL)/(ti/t0)<br>
= {(4 + 7/9)/10}/{(81 + l/3)/122}<br>
= 0.72<br>
[0132]<br>
For comparison, a GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
device including an active layer shown as<br>
Comparative Example 3 in Table 3 was produced. The well<br>
layer density di and the well layer density d2 in Comparative<br>
Example 3 are determined from the equations (1-1) and (1-2)<br>
as follows:<br>
[0133]<br>
[Comparative Example 3]<br>
d2 = (WL2/WL)/(t2/t0)<br>

The GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting devices of<br>
Example 3 and Comparative Example 3 were evaluated on the<br>
basis of the same method as in Example 1.<br>
[0135]<br>
Fig. 18 shows a relation between the operating current<br>
density and emission peak wavelength of each of the GaNbased<br>
semiconductor light-emitting devices. When the<br>
operating current density is increased from 0.1 A/cm2 to 300<br>
A/cm2, in Comparative Example 3, AA, = -9 nm, while in Example<br>
3, AX = -1 nm and a very small emission wavelength shift is<br>
realized. Therefore, the blue light-emitting GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device 1 of Example 3 exhibits<br>
a significantly small shift of the emission wavelength and<br>
is thus obviously superior to a conventional GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device.<br>
EXAMPLE 4 . .<br>
[0136]<br>
Example 4 is also a modification of Example 1. In<br>
Example 4, Fig. 19A is a schematic top view of a GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device of Example 4, and Fig.<br>
19B is a schematic sectional view (oblique lines are<br>
omitted9 taken along arrows B-B in Fig. 19A. The GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device 1 of Example 4 is<br>
different in the planar shape of an active layer from the<br>
GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device 1 of Example 1<br>
shown in Figs. 6A and 6B. Namely, in Example 4, the active<br>
layer 15 of the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting<br>
device 1 has a circular planar shape having a diameter<br>
(corresponding to a short diameter) L2 of 14 fxm and an area<br>
of about 1.5 x 10"6 cm2. Except this point, the GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device 1 of Example 4 has the<br>
same constitution and structure as those of the GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device 1 of Example 1. The<br>
GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device 1 of Example 4<br>
is referred to as the "GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
device of Example 4A" for convenience sake.<br>
[0137]<br>
Furthermore, a GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting<br>
device 1 having the same constitution and structure as those<br>
of the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device 1 of<br>
Example 1 shown in Figs. 6A and 6B was produced, in which<br>
the active layer had a partially cut-away square planar<br>
shape (area: about 6.8 x 10~4 cm2) having a side length<br>
(corresponding to a short side) LI of 300 jum. The GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device 1 is referred to as the<br>
"GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device of Example<br>
4B" for convenience sake.<br>
 [0138]<br>
[Comparative Example 4]<br>
For comparison, a GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
device having the same structure as that of the<br>
GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device 1 of Example 4<br>
except that the constitution of the active layer was the<br>
same as Comparative Example 1 was produced as Comparative<br>
Example 4. The GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting<br>
device is referred to as the "GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
device of Comparative Example 4A" for convenience<br>
sake. Furthermore, a GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting<br>
device having the same constitution and structure as those<br>
of the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device 1 of<br>
Comparative Example 1 was produced, in which the active<br>
layer had a partially cut-away square planar shape (area:<br>
about 6.8 x 10"4 cm2) having a side length (corresponding to<br>
a short side) LI of 300 j^m. The GaN-based semiconductor<br>
light-emitting device is referred to as the "GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device of Comparative Example<br>
4B" for convenience sake.<br>
[0139]<br>
When the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting devices<br>
of Example 4A and Comparative Example 4A and Example 4B and<br>
Comparative Example 4B were driven at an operating current<br>
density of 30 A/cm2, the driving current values are about 50<br>
jaA and about 20 mA, respectively.<br>
[0140]<br>
Fig. 20A shows a relation between the operating current<br>
density and peak wavelength shift of each of the GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting devices of Example 4A and<br>
Comparative Example 4A, and Fig. 2OB shows a relation<br>
between the operating current density and peak wavelength<br>
shift of each of the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting<br>
devices of Example 4B and Comparative Example 4B.<br>
[0141]<br>
In the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device of<br>
any size, when the operating current density is 30 A/cm2 or<br>
more, the emission wavelength shift of the example is<br>
smaller than that of the comparative example. It is thus<br>
said that the effect of an asymmetric distribution in the<br>
active layer is exhibited regardless of size. On the other<br>
hand, it is found that in comparison at the same operating<br>
current density, the emission wavelength shift of Example 4A<br>
is smaller than Example 4B.<br>
[0142]<br>
Furthermore, for example, variations in the composition<br>
and thickness, doping, light emission, and threshold voltage<br>
of the quantum well layers are present in a plane of a GaNbased<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device. The minimummaximum<br>
difference of the variations increases as the area<br>
of the GaN-based semiconductor light-emit ting device<br>
increases. When a GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting<br>
device is a large size and has a transverse passage of a<br>
current flow, it is difficult to uniformly pass a current<br>
due to the sheet resistance of a layer, thereby causing<br>
variations in the operating current density in a plane. For<br>
these reasons, in a large GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
device, a shift of the emission wavelength due to a<br>
change in the operating current density is more emphasized.<br>
In contrast, in a small GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
device, a shift of the emission wavelength can be<br>
further decreased.<br>
[0143]<br>
Such GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting devices<br>
capable of further decreasing the emission wavelength sift<br>
and each including an active layer having a diameter of<br>
about 14 ^im, for example, can be formed at a high density in<br>
a matrix shape on a substrate and used for a projection-type<br>
display or mounted on a large substrate to realize a directview-<br>
type large television receiver. In addition, since the<br>
emission wavelength shift can be decreased, the<br>
manufacturing cost of a GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
device can be decreased, and a display device with<br>
an excellent dynamic range, gradation, and color stability<br>
can be realized by modulating the pulse amplitude and pulse<br>
density (pulse width).<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
[0144]<br>
Example 5 relates to a light illuminator of the present<br>
invention. The light illuminator of Example 5 includes a<br>
GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device and a color<br>
conversion material on which light emitted from the GaNbased<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device is incident and<br>
which emits light at a wavelength different from that of the<br>
light emitted from the GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
device. The light illuminator of Example 5 has the<br>
same structure as that of a conventional light illuminator,<br>
and the color conversion material is applied, for example,<br>
on a light emission portion of the GaN-based semiconductor<br>
light-emitting device.<br>
[0145]<br>
The basic constitution and structure of the GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device (light-emitting diode)<br>
are the same as described in Examples 1 to 4. Namely, the<br>
GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device includes:<br>
(A) the first GaN-based compound semiconductor layer 13<br>
having n-type conductivity;<br>
(B) the active layer 15 having a multi-quantum well<br>
structure including well layers and barrier layers for<br>
separating between the well layers; and<br>
 (C) the second GaN-based compound semiconductor layer<br>
17 having p-type conductivity;<br>
wherein the well layers are disposed in the active<br>
layer 15 so as to satisfy the relation di 
the well layer density on the first GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer side in the active layer and d2 is the<br>
well layer density on the second GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer side.<br>
[0146]<br>
In Example 5, light emitted from the GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device is blue, and light<br>
emitted from the color conversion material is yellow. The<br>
color conversion material includes YAG (yttrium aluminum<br>
garnet) fluorescent particles and white light is emitted by<br>
color mixing of the light (blue) emitted from the GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device and the light (yellow)<br>
emitted from the color conversion material.<br>
[0147]<br>
Alternatively, in Example 5, light emitted from the<br>
GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device is blue, and<br>
light emitted from the color conversion material is green<br>
and red so that white light is emitted by color mixing of<br>
the light (blue) emitted from the GaN-based semiconductor<br>
light-emitting device and the light (green and red) emitted<br>
from the color conversion material. Specifically, the color<br>
- 106 -<br>
onversion material emitting green light includes green<br>
light-emitting fluorescent particles of SrGa2S4:Eu which are<br>
excited by the blue light emitted from the GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device, and the color<br>
conversion material emitting red light includes red lightemitting<br>
fluorescent particles of CaS:Eu which are excited<br>
by the blue light emitted from the GaN-based semiconductor<br>
light-emitting device.<br>
[0148]<br>
In the light-emitting device of Example 5, the GaNbased<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device may be driven by,<br>
for example, the driving circuit 26 described in Example 1,<br>
and the luminance (brightness) of the light-emitting device<br>
can be controlled by controlling the peak current of the<br>
driving current, and the pulse width and/or the pulse<br>
density of the driving current. In this case, a large shift<br>
of the emission wavelength can be suppressed using the same<br>
GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device (lightemitting<br>
diode) as described in Examples 1 to 4, thereby<br>
stabilizing the emission wavelength of the GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
[0149]<br>
Example 6 relates to an image display device according<br>
to a first embodiment of the present invention. The image<br>
display device of Example 6 includes a GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device for displaying an image.<br>
The basic constitution and structure of the GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device (light-emitting diode)<br>
are the same as described in Examples 1 to 4. Namely, the<br>
GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device includes:<br>
(A) the first GaN-based compound semiconductor layer 13<br>
having n-type conductivity;<br>
(B) the active layer 15 having a multi-quantum well<br>
structure including well layers and barrier layers for<br>
separating between the well layers; and<br>
(C) the second GaN-based compound semiconductor layer<br>
17 having p-type conductivity;<br>
wherein the well layers are disposed in the active<br>
layer 15 so as to satisfy the relation di 
the well layer density on the first GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer side in the active layer and d2 is the<br>
well layer density on the second GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer side.<br>
[0150]<br>
In the image display device of Example 6, the operating<br>
current density (or the driving current) of the GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device for displaying an image<br>
can be controlled, and the pulse width and/or the pulse<br>
density of the driving current can be controlled to control<br>
the luminance (brightness) of a display image. Namely, the<br>
number of control parameters of luminance is increased in<br>
comparison to a conventional technique, thereby permitting<br>
luminance control in a wider range. Thus, a wide dynamic<br>
range of luminance can be obtained. Specifically, for<br>
example, the luminance of the whole image display device may<br>
be controlled by controlling the peak current of the driving<br>
current (operating current), and the luminance may be finely<br>
controlled by controlling the pulse width and/or the pulse<br>
density of the driving current. In contrast, the luminance<br>
of the whole image display device may be controlled by<br>
controlling the pulse width and/or the pulse density of the<br>
driving current, and the luminance may be finely controlled<br>
by controlling the peak current of the driving current<br>
(operating current). In this case, a large shift of the<br>
emission wavelength can be suppressed using the same GaNbased<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device (light-emitting<br>
diode) as described in Examples 1 to 4, thereby stabilizing<br>
the emission wavelength of the GaN-based semiconductor<br>
light-emitting device.<br>
[0151]<br>

includes image display devices with constitutions and<br>
structures which will be described below. Unless otherwise<br>
specified, the number of GaN-based semiconductor light-<br>
emitting devices constituting an image display device or a<br>
light-emitting device panel may be determined on the basis<br>
of the specifications required for the image display device.<br>

EXAMPLE 7<br>
[0176]<br>
Example 7 relates to an&gt; image display device according<br>
to a second embodiment of the present invention. The image<br>
display device of Example 7 includes light-emitting device<br>
units UN for displaying a color image, which are arranged in<br>
a two-dimensional-matrix and each of which includes a first<br>
light-emitting device emitting blue light, a second lightemitting<br>
device emitting green light, and a third lightemitting<br>
device emitting red light. A GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light emitting device (light-emitting diode)<br>
constituting at least one of the first light-emitting device,<br>
the second light-emitting device, and the third lightemitting<br>
device has the same constitution and structure as<br>
described in Examples 1 to 4. Namely, the GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device includes:<br>
 (A) a first GaN-based compound semiconductor layer 13<br>
having n-type conductivity;<br>
(B) an active layer 15 having a multi-quantum well<br>
structure including well layers and barrier layers for<br>
separating between the well layers; and<br>
(C) a second GaN-based compound semiconductor layer 17<br>
having p-type conductivity;<br>
wherein the well layers are disposed in the active<br>
layer so as to satisfy the relation di 
well layer density on the first GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer side in the active layer and d2 is the<br>
well layer density on the second GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer side.<br>
[0177]<br>
In the image display device, any one of the first<br>
light-emitting device, the second light-emitting device, and<br>
the third light-emitting device may be the GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device 1 described in Examples<br>
1 to 4. According to circumstances, for example, the red<br>
light-emitting device may be an AlInGaP-based compound<br>
semiconductor light-emitting diode.<br>
[0178]<br>
In the image display device of Example 7, the luminance<br>
(brightness) of a display image can be controlled by<br>
controlling the pulse width and/or the pulse density of the<br>
driving current in addition to the control of the operating<br>
current density (or the driving current) of the GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device for displaying an image.<br>
Therefore, the number of control parameters of luminance is<br>
increased in comparison to a conventional technique, thereby<br>
permitting luminance control in a wider range. Namely, a<br>
wide dynamic range of luminance can be obtained.<br>
Specifically, for example, the luminance of the whole image<br>
display device may be controlled by controlling the peak<br>
current of the driving current (operating current), and the<br>
luminance may be finely controlled by controlling the pulse<br>
width and/or the pulse density of the driving current. In<br>
contrast, the luminance of the whole image display device<br>
may be controlled by controlling the pulse width and/or the<br>
pulse density of the driving current, and the luminance may<br>
be finely controlled by controlling the peak current of the<br>
driving current (operating current). In addition, by using<br>
the same GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device<br>
(light-emitting diode) as described in Examples 1 to 4, a<br>
large shift of the emission wavelength can be suppressed to<br>
stabilize the emission wavelength of the GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device.<br>
[0179]<br>
Examples of the image display device of Example 7<br>
includes image display devices with constitutions and<br>
structures which will be described below. The number of<br>
light-emitting device units may be determined on the basis<br>
of the specifications required for the image display device.<br>
[0180]<br>

In a passive matrix-type or active matrix-type, directview,<br>

state of each of first, second, and third lightemitting<br>

of the electrodes (p-type electrode or n-type electrode) of<br>

Fig. 31, a red light-emitting semiconductor light-emitting<br>
device is shown by "R", a green light-emitting semiconductor<br>
light-emitting device is shown by "G", and a blue light-<br>
emitting semiconductor light-emitting device is shown by<br>
"B") is connected to a driver 45 which is connected to a<br>
column driver 43 and a row driver 44. The other electrode<br>
(n-type electrode or p-type electrode) of each of the GaNbased<br>
semiconductor light-emitting devices 1 is connected to<br>
a ground wire. The emission/non-emission state of each GaNbased<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device 1 is controlled by,<br>
for example, the row driver 44 which selects the drivers 45,<br>
and a luminance signal for driving each GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device 1 is supplied from the<br>
column driver 43. When a predetermined voltage is<br>
separately supplied to each of the drivers 45 from a power<br>
supply not shown in the drawing, the drivers 45 supply a<br>
driving current (based on PDM control or PWM control) to the<br>
GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting devices 1 according<br>
to the luminance signal. One of the functions of the column<br>
driver 43 is the same as that of the driving circuit 26 of<br>
Example 1. Each of the red light-emitting semiconductor<br>
light-emitting device R, the green light-emitting<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device G, and the blue lightemitting<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device B is selected •<br>
by the driver 45. The emission/non-emission states of the<br>
red light-emitting semiconductor light-emitting device R,<br>
the green light-emitting semiconductor light-emitting device<br>
G, and the blue light-emitting semiconductor light-emitting<br>
device B may be time-division-controlled or simultaneously<br>
controlled. Since each GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
device can be selected and driven by a known method,<br>
detailed description is omitted. In the direct-view-type<br>
image display device, the light is directly viewed, and in<br>
the projection-type image display device, the light is<br>
projected on a screen through the projection lens 56.<br>

EXAMPLE 8<br>
[0184]<br>
Example 8 relates to a planar light source device and a<br>
liquid crystal display assembly (specifically, a color<br>
liquid crystal display assembly) of the present invention.<br>
The planar light source device of Example 8 is a planar<br>
light source device for irradiating the back of a<br>
transmissive or transflective color liquid crystal display<br>
device. The color liquid crystal display assembly of<br>
Example 8 is a color liquid crystal display assembly<br>
including a transmissive or transflective color liquid<br>
crystal display device and a planar light source device for<br>
irradiating the back of the color liquid crystal display<br>
device.<br>
[0185]<br>
A GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device (lightemitting<br>
diode) used as a light source of the planar light<br>
source device has the same basic constitution and structure<br>
as described in Examples 1 to 4. Namely, the GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device includes:<br>
(A) a first GaN-based compound semiconductor layer 13<br>
having n-type conductivity;<br>
 (B) an active layer 15 having a multi-quanturn well<br>
structure including well layers and barrier layers for<br>
separating between the well layers; and<br>
(C) a second GaN-based compound semiconductor layer 17<br>
having p-type conductivity;<br>
wherein the well layers are disposed in the active<br>
layer so as to satisfy the relation di 
well layer density on the first GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer side in the active layer and d2 is the<br>
well layer density on the second GaN-based compound<br>
semiconductor layer side.<br>
[0186]<br>
In the planar light source device of Example 8, the<br>
luminance (brightness) of the GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
device serving as the light source can be<br>
controlled by controlling the operating current density (or<br>
the driving current) of the GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
device serving as the light source and the pulse<br>
width and/or the pulse density of the driving current.<br>
Namely, the number of control parameters of luminance is<br>
increased in comparison to a conventional technique, thereby<br>
permitting luminance control in a wider range. Thus, a wide<br>
dynamic range of luminance can be obtained. Specifically,<br>
for example, the luminance of the whole planar light source<br>
device may be controlled by controlling the peak current of<br>
the driving current (operating current), and the luminance<br>
may be finely controlled by controlling the pulse width<br>
and/or the pulse density of the driving current. In<br>
contrast, the luminance of the whole planar light source<br>
device may be controlled by controlling the pulse width<br>
and/or the pulse density of the driving current, and the<br>
luminance may be finely controlled by controlling the peak<br>
current of the driving current (operating current). In this<br>
case, a large shift of the emission wavelength can be<br>
suppressed using the same GaN-based semiconductor lightemitting<br>
device (light-emitting diode) as described in<br>
Examples 1 to 4', thereby stabilizing the emission wavelength<br>
of the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device.<br>

and array state of the light-emitting devices in the planar<br>

[0188]<br>
More specifically, the color liquid crystal display<br>
assembly 200 of Example 8 includes:<br>
a transmissive color liquid crystal display device 210<br>
including:<br>
(a) a front panel 220 provided with a transparent first<br>
electrode 224;<br>
(b) a rear panel 230 provided with a transparent second<br>
electrode 234; and<br>
(c) a liquid crystal material 227 disposed between the<br>
front panel 220 and the rear panel 230; and<br>
(d) a planar light source device (direct-lighting type<br>
back light) 240 having semiconductor light-emitting devices<br>
1R, 1G, and IB serving as light sources.<br>
The planar light source device (direct-lighting type back<br>
light) 240 is opposed to the rear panel 230, for irradiating<br>
the rear panel side of the color liquid crystal display<br>
device 210.<br>
[0189]<br>
The direct-lighting type planar light source device 240<br>
includes a casing 241 including an outer frame 243 and an<br>
inner frame 244. The ends of the transmissive color liquid<br>
crystal display device 210 are held between the outer frame<br>
243 and the inner frame 244 with spacers 245A and 245B<br>
provided therebetween. Also, a guide member 246 is disposed<br>
between the outer frame 243 and the inner frame 244 to form<br>
a structure in which the color liquid crystal display device<br>
210 held between the outer frame 243 and the inner frame 244<br>
is not deviated. Further, a diffusion plate 251 is provided<br>
in an upper portion of the casing 241 to be attached to the<br>
inner frame 244 through a spacer 245C and a bracket member<br>
247. Further, an optical functional sheet group consisting<br>
of a diffusion sheet 252, a prism sheet 253, and a<br>
polarization conversion sheet 254 is stacked on the<br>
diffusion plate 251.<br>
[0190]<br>
A reflective sheet 255 is provided in a lower portion<br>
of the casing 241. The reflective sheet 255 is disposed so<br>
that the reflective surface faces the diffusion plate 251<br>
and is attached to the bottom 242A of the casing 241 through<br>
an attachment member not shown in the drawing. The<br>
reflective sheet 255 includes a silver amplified reflective<br>
film having a structure in which for example, a silver<br>
reflective film, a low-refractive-index film, and a highrefractive-<br>
index film are stacked in order on a base sheet.<br>
The reflective sheet 255 reflects light emitted from a<br>
plurality of red light-emitting AlGalnP-based semiconductor<br>
light-emitting devices 1R, a plurality of green lightemitting<br>
GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting devices 1G,<br>
and a plurality of blue light-emitting GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting devices IB, and light reflected<br>
by the side 242B of the casing 241. Therefore, red light,<br>
green light, and blue right emitted from the plurality of<br>
semiconductor light-emitting devices 1R, 1G, and IB are<br>
mixed to obtain white light with high color purity as<br>

substrate 221 including, for example, a glass substrate, and<br>

first substrate 221. The front panel further includes a<br>
color filter 222 provided on the inner surface of the first<br>
substrate 221 and covered with an overcoat layer 223<br>
composed of an acrylic resin or an epoxy resin, the<br>
transparent first electrode (also referred to as the "common<br>
electrode" and composed of, for example, ITO) 224 being<br>
formed on the overcoat layer 223. Further, an alignment<br>
film 225 is formed on the transparent first electrode 224.<br>
On the other hand, more specifically, the rear panel<br>

electrode (also referred to as the "pixel electrode" and<br>
composed of ITO) 234, which are provided on the inner<br>

Since the members and the liquid crystal material which<br>
constitute the transmissive color liquid crystal display<br>
device may be known members and material, detailed<br>
description is omitted.<br>
[0194]<br>
Each of the red light-emitting semiconductor lightemitting<br>
device 1R, the green light-emitting GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device 1G, and the blue lightemitting<br>
GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device IB<br>
has the structure shown by (A) in Fig. 2 and is connected to<br>
the driving circuit 26. Each light-emitting device is<br>
driven by the same method as described in Example 1.<br>
[0195]<br>
When a planar light source device is divided into a<br>
plurality of regions so that each region is independently<br>
dynamically controlled, the dynamic range of luminance of a<br>
color liquid crystal display device can be further widened.<br>
In other words, a planar light source device is divided into<br>
a plurality of ranges for each image display frame, and the<br>
brightness of the planar light source device is changed in<br>
each region according to an image signal (for example, the<br>
luminance of each region of the planar light source device<br>
is changed in proportion to the maximum luminance of the<br>
corresponding region of an image). In this case, in a<br>
bright region of an image, the corresponding region of the<br>
planar light source device is brightened, while in a dark<br>
region of an image, the corresponding region of the planar<br>
light source device is darkened, so that the contrast ratio<br>
of the color liquid crystal display device can be<br>
significantly improved. Furthermore, the mean power<br>
consumption can be decreased. In this technique, it is<br>
important to decrease color variations between the regions<br>
of the planar light source device. In a GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device, variations easily occur<br>
in luminous colors during the manufacture. However, the<br>
GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device used in<br>
Example 8 is the same as described in Examples 1 to 4, and<br>
thus a planar light source device with little variation in<br>
luminous colors between the regions can be achieved.<br>
Further, in addition to the control of the operating current<br>
density (or the driving current) of the GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device used as the light source,<br>
the luminance (brightness) of the GaN-based semiconductor<br>
light-emitting device used as the light source can be<br>
controlled by controlling the pulse width and/or the pulse<br>
density of the driving current. Therefore, the independent<br>
dynamic control of each of a plurality of divided regions<br>
can be securely easily performed. Specifically, for example,<br>
the luminance of each region of the planar light source<br>
device may be controlled by controlling the peak current of<br>
the driving current (operating current), and the luminance<br>
may be finely controlled by controlling the pulse width<br>
and/or the pulse density of the driving current. In<br>
contrast, the luminance of the whole planar light source<br>
device may be controlled by controlling the pulse width<br>
and/or the pulse density of the driving current, and the<br>
luminance may be finely controlled by controlling the peak<br>
current of the driving current (operating current).<br>

[0196]<br>
Example 9 is a modification of Example 8. In Example 8,<br>
the planar light source device is a direct-lighting type.<br>
However, in Example 9, a planar light source device is an<br>
edge light type. Fig. 34 is a conceptual view of a color<br>
liquid crystal display assembly of Example 9. A schematic<br>
partial sectional view of a color liquid crystal display<br>
device of Example 9 is the same as shown in Fig. 33.<br>
[0197]<br>
A color liquid crystal display assembly 200A of Example<br>
9 includes:<br>
a transmissive color liquid crystal display device 210<br>
including:<br>
(a) a front panel 220 with a transparent first<br>
electrode 224;<br>
(b) a rear panel 230 with a transparent second<br>
electrode 234; and<br>
(c) a liquid crystal material 227 disposed between the<br>
front panel 220 and the rear panel 230; and<br>
(d) a planar light source device (edge light-type back<br>
light) 250 including a light guide plate 270 and a light<br>
source 260, for irradiating the rear panel side of the color<br>
liquid crystal display device 210.<br>
The light guide plate 270 is opposed to the rear panel 230.<br>
[0198]<br>
The light source 260 includes, for example, a red<br>
light-emitting AlGalnP-based semiconductor light-emitting<br>
device, a green light-emitting GaN-based semiconductor<br>
light-emitting device, and a blue light-emitting GaN-based<br>
semiconductor light-emitting device. These semiconductor<br>
light-emitting devices are not shown in the drawing. As the<br>
green light-emitting GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting<br>
device and the blue light-emitting GaN-based semiconductor<br>
light-emitting device, the same GaN-based semiconductor<br>
light-emitting device as described in Example 1 to 4 can be<br>
used. The constitution and structure of each of the front<br>
panel 220 and the rear panel 230 constituting the color<br>
liquid crystal display device 210 are the same.as those of<br>
the front panel 220 and the rear panel 230 of Example 8<br>
described with reference to Fig. 33, and thus detailed<br>
description is omitted.<br>
[0199]<br>
For example, 'the light guide plate 270 composed of a<br>
polycarbonate resin has a first surface (bottom) 271, a<br>
second surface (top) 273 opposite to the first surface 271,<br>
the first side 274, a second side 275, a third side 276<br>
opposite to the first side 274, and a fourth side opposite<br>
to the second side 274. A specific example of the shape of<br>
the light guide plate 270 is a wedge-shaped truncated<br>
quadrangular pyramid shape as a whole. In this case, the<br>
two opposing sides of the truncated quadrangular prism<br>
correspond to the first and second surfaces 271 and 273, and<br>
the bottom of the truncated quadrangular prism corresponds<br>
to the first side 274. Furthermore, an irregular portion<br>
272 is provided on the surface of the first surface 271.<br>
The continuous irregular portion of the light guide plate<br>
270 has a triangular sectional shape taken along a virtual<br>
plane vertical to the first surface in the incidence<br>
direction of the light guide plate 270. In other words, the<br>
irregular portion 272 provided on the surface of the first<br>
surface 271 has a prisms shape. The second surface 273 of<br>
the light guide plate 270 may be smooth (i.e., a mirror<br>
surface) or may be provided with blast crimps having a<br>
diffusion effect (i.e., a fine irregular surface). Further,<br>
a reflective member 281 is disposed opposite to the first<br>
surface 271 of the light guide plate 270. The color liquid<br>
crystal display device 210 is disposed opposite to the<br>
second surface 273 of the light guide plate 270. Further, a<br>
diffusion sheet 282 and a prism sheet 283 are disposed<br>
between the color liquid crystal display device 210 and the<br>
second surface 273 of the light guide plate 270. Light<br>
emitted from the light source 260 is incident on the light<br>
guide plate 270 from the first side 274 (for example,<br>
corresponding to the bottom of the truncated quadrangular<br>
prism), scattered by collision with the irregular portion<br>
272 of the first surface 271, emitted from the first surface<br>
271, reflected by the reflective member 281, again incident<br>
on the first surface 271, emitted from the second surface<br>
273, and passes through the diffusion sheet 282 and the<br>
prism sheet 283 to illuminate the color liquid crystal<br>
display device 210.<br>

device may be reversed. A direct-view-type image display<br>
device may be a type in which an image is projected on the<br>
human retina. In each example, the n-type electrode and the<br>
p-type electrode are formed on the same side (upper side) of<br>
the GaN-based semiconductor light-emitting device. However,<br>
alternatively, the substrate 10 is separated, and the n-type<br>
electrode and the p-type electrode may be formed on<br>
different sides of the GaN-based semiconductor light-<br>
emitting device, i.e., the lower side and the upper side,<br>
respectively. In addition, a reflective electrode of silver<br>
or aluminum may be used as an electrode instead of the<br>
transparent electrode, and the long side (long diameter) and<br>
the short side (short diameter) may be changed.<br>
