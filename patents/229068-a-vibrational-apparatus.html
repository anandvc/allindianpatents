SONIC HEADS AND ASSEMBLIES AND USES THEREOF<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to vibration or sound ("sound") generation as might be useful, inter alia, in sonic drilling. The invention relates to related apparatus, methods, systems and procedures.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
There is frequently a need to provide vibration.<br>
Examples of use of vibration includes separation procedures reliant on the buoyancy of particulate materials in amongst other particulate materials, stripping of sand from a cast item, ground or other compaction, pile driving and drilling (including directional and/or rotary drilling).<br>
Usually vibration is generated reliant upon the spinning of an eccentric weight or counter rotating weights. See for example, US Patent 3,866,480 which discloses an orbital vibrator. Such orbiting mass oscillators may employ orbiting rollers which are rotatably driven around the inner race wall of a housing, as disclosed in US Patent No. 4815328 to Bodine, or an unbalanced rotor, the output of which is coupled to a drill bit as disclosed in US Patent No. 4261425 to Bodine.<br>
Other methods of creating and utilising sonic energy for application to a mandrel are also disclosed in US Patent Specifications 3375884 (Bodine), 3379263 (Bodine), 4836299 (Bodine), 4527637 (Bodine); 5549170 (Barrow) and 5562169 (Barrow) and WO01/83933 (Bar-Cohen).<br>
Japanese Patent Specification 57-179407 of Kawasaki Heavy Ind Ltd discloses a pile hammer employing a fluid actuator to operate in accordance to the resonance of the pile for the inherent frequency of the soil by providing a relief valve and a bypass circuit. Amplitudes of movement beyond those purely attributable to the liquid volumes are stated as being obtainable.<br><br>
Another device that uses hydraulic fluid to create vibratory impact is shown in Australian Patent 479534 (A/S Moelven Brag) (see US 3747694).<br>
A preferred use of interest to ourselves for vibrational apparatus, but not one to which the vibrational apparatus needs be restricted, is in support of down hole drilling or boring equipment. Other uses include those hereinafter discussed.<br>
A variety of different prior art procedures have been disclosed including our own patent specifications reliant upon down hole directional drilling apparatus capable of being controlled through the drill string. It is advanced and/or rotated from the prime mover above ground or in an excavated region of the ground.<br>
In some applications however there is a preference to subject the drill string and the drill head to rapid vibrations thereby allowing the movement through the ground by breaking up encountered rock structures and compacting the surrounds thereby reducing the materials to be removed from down hole. Such procedures, whether reliant on resonance within the drill string or not, is referred to as sonic drilling or boring.<br>
Sonic drilling methods and apparatus are disclosed, inter alia, in US Patent Nos. 4836299,4548281 and 5417290 which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Sonic drilling is accomplished by vibrating a drill string to produce compressive and expansive waves in the drill string. The vibrations are induced in a longitudinal direction of the drill string and the drill string is preferably vibrated at a resonant frequency. The resonant frequency is dependent upon a number of factors including the length of the drill string.<br>
The vibrational forces on the drill string causes the drill string to contract and expand in the longitudinal direction. The vibrational forces at the bottom of the drill string shear, displace and/or otherwise fracture apart the soil and/or rock particles thereby cutting through the formation.<br><br>
It has also been disclosed in the art that drilling systems which employ cycloidal sonic energy as a method of drilling cause a highly effective action on the bottom and particularly the adjacent side walls of the bottom portion of a well bore by virtue of the cycloidal drilling action.<br>
The present invention recognises an advantage is derivable in the area of sonic drilling where it is possible to commence the generation of the sonic head whilst in its operative connection (directly or indirectly) with the drill string. For many prior art forms of sonic head re-starts are difficult owing to the need to retract the drill string from against a rock face and other structure that might be binding the drill string as a whole.<br>
It is therefore an object of one or some embodiments of the present invention to provide a sonic head assembly and/or a sonic head for such assembly which will provide the option of start-up without a need for retraction in such circumstances and/or separation of the sonic head in the drill string.<br>
It is an object of one or some aspects of the present invention to provide a sonic head assembly and/or sonic head for such an assembly which enables the generation of vibrations including sonic vibrations into a structure without a requirement for tuning to a resonant frequency of the structure for it to be vibrative. In some aspects of the present invention is envisaged that start-up can commence without a need for resonance being achieved but in some embodiments of the present invention such resonance can still be achievable by adjustment of control parameters as the sonic head assembly is being used.<br>
In one or some other embodiments of the present invention, it is an object to provide a sonic head and/or a sonic head assembly not rehant upon the rotation of eccentrics but which imparts a useful sonic output that can be used in many situations or which at least provides the public with a useful choice.<br><br>
It is an object of one or some other embodiments of the present invention to provide constructions of a fluid driven sonic head for a sonic head assembly which confers some measure of isolation of key components from the affect of excessive vibration and/or by omission of a component or components avoids difficulty from any such vibration.<br>
It is an object of one or more embodiments of the present invention to provide a sonic head and/or related sonic head assembly reliant upon separate fluid feeds, one for imparting the vibration and at least one for controlling, other input parameters e.g. amplitude, frequency, the valving, etc.<br>
It is an object of one or more other embodiments of the present invention to provide a sonic head and/or sonic head assembly which has a fluid supply and retrieval system that takes the fluid to ambient or near ambient pressures (preferably prior to return to the sonic head).<br>
It is an object of one or more other embodiments of the present invention to provide sonic head support arrangements and/or buffers and/or linkages which provide some freedom(s) of movement between at least part of the sonic head and a supporting frame yet allows some relativity of movement therebetween.<br>
The present invention is also directed to vibrational apparatus and to the related methods of operation and use which will at least provide a useful choice.<br>

a second valving arrangement to control fluid flow into and out of the second pressurisable chamber,<br>
one or more supply (supplies) of pressurisable fluid, or adaption(s) therefor, to the shuttle whereby each of the first and second valving arrangements can allow or not allow fluid entry to the respective chamber,<br>
one or more outtake (outtakes) of fluid, or adaption(s) therefor, whereby each of the first and second valving arrangements can allow or disallow fluid egress from the respective chamber;<br>
wherein the valving arrangements and shuttle movement relative to the complementary member(s) is such that as the first valving arrangement allows fluid entry to the first chamber thereby to expand both the first chamber and volume of fluid therein, the second valving arrangement allows fluid egress from the second chamber thereby to allow both compression of both the second chamber and the volume of fluid therein, and so forth in an alternating shuttle moving manner,<br>
and wherein the output is (directly or indirectly) from one or other (or both) complementary member(s) rather than the shuttle.<br>
The "shuttle" in some embodiments may be perceived as substantially static yet moving relative to the other componentry. The opposite may also be the case as many hybrids of the two.<br>
Accordingly "shuttle" as used herein throughout should be understood as shuttling relative to other aspects of the assembly.<br>

a shuttle,<br><br>

(preferably to enable operation at higher frequency when desired, to enable resonance at shorter stroke or amplitude, to provide higher efficiency and/or provide greater flexibility and versatility)),<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the preferred form of the present invention there are two variable volume chambers and each operates in an out of phase manner with respect to the other such that there is a positive powering of each chamber to a larger volume under the valve controlled pressure and volume of supplied fluid<br><br>
thereby avoiding the need for outtakes of the fluids to provide any direct drive to diminish the volume of that same chamber otherwise than from an expanding effect on the other variable volume chamber.   Preferably in use neither chamber is ever to be devoid of liquid/fluid therein. In the arrangement as shown in Figure 1,<br>

26	denotes a tire<br>
27	denotes a bearing cage<br>
28	denotes an O-ring, and<br>
29	denotes a plastic piston spacer.<br>
With reference to the arrangement as shown in Figure 5 it can be seen that there is a first variable volume chamber 30 and a second variable volume chamber 31 and whilst a tire like flexible connection 32 and 33 respectively links each piston including part 34 and 35 with the shuttle 36, the amplitude of movement envisaged is relatively small during most operations. Preferably they range from a fraction of a millimetre to several centimetres but could be more the larger the sonic head is. The frequency can be from a few Hertz to thousands.<br>
Each chamber is bounded by the piston part of its component 34 or 35 which preferably each includes peripheral pressure drop grooves without piston rings. This is to avoid ring damage as a result of the vibration and to allow the supplied fluid the prospect of some lubricating effect between the piston and the stationary valve blocks 37 and 38 respectively. As can be seen each stationary valve block 37 or 38 is ported and coacts with a rotating valve member or rotating valve shaft 39 and 40 respectively to either allow fluid into or fluid from its proximate variable volume chamber 30 or 31.<br>
Axially within each rotating valve member 39 is a passageway which ports radially therefrom which is used preferably for the outtake of fluid back to a collection chamber form whence it can be returned (e.g. by pumping) as shown in Figure 5. The oil inlet lines are shown supply via passageways to the valving arrangement exteriorly of the rotating valving member 39 or 40.<br>
A separate fluid supply (not shown in Figure 5) is utilised for a hydraulic motor 41 which is to operate via the member 42 and endless drive belt or the equivalent 43 for each of rotating valve members 39 and 40. Such a hydraulic motor receives a fluid supply preferably provided separately from<br><br>
the volume of fluid being supplied for the purpose of energising the sonic head insofar as the shuttle movement is concerned.<br>
As can be seen, preferably the arrangement which includes 41, 42 and 43, is on a slide 44 relative to a frame 45 which directly or indirectly supports the sonic head. The frame 45 itself can be arranged as a slidable carriage on a support rail or other structure 46 such that preferably it operates relative thereto within limits.<br>
If desired the slide 44 and the rail or other structure 46 can be linked.<br>
Shown in Figure 6 is the sonic head having a drill string mandrel or the equivalent 47 adapted to be rotated by an endless drive belt/chain or the equivalent 48 driven by a hydraulic motor 49 (separate hydraulic feed again). Optional rotation of the mandrel 47 will rotate or manoeuvre a drill string attached thereto whilst the mandrel or the equivalent 47 is vibratable (directly or indirectly) under the action of the proximate piston or complementary means of the sonic head.<br>
Such a proximate piston, piston assembly, or complementary means is preferably supported so as to be moveable at least in a longitudinal sense to some extent relative to the frame 45 and for this purpose some guided linkages are preferably provided. For example, links 50 and 51 on either side of the sonic head can link by a pivot 52 or 53 to the sonic head and by 54 and 55 to the frame 45. At the same time limits of movement can be imposed by compression springs 56 and 57 (or air bags) in conjunction preferably with airbags 58 and 59 which provide a cushioning or damping effect between the sonic head and the frame 45 and in turn the carriages or supports 44 and 46.<br>
It can be seen therefore that the linkages allow some semblance of rotation of the dog bone links whilst at the same time allowing some axial displacement of the sonic head as a whole, yet the shuttle 36 is free of direct contact with the frame and/or the slides or carriages 44 and 46 otherwise than as a consequence of the flexible drives and the hose and/or other linkages not shown in the attached drawings.<br><br>
Preferably all connections (including of hydraulics) are of flexible vibration resistance hoses connected so as to avoid involuntary disconnection.<br>
The sonic head of the present invention can start with a jackhammer effect even without drill string tuned for resonance. Control thereafter can be (a) speed of rotating valves (rotor) and/or (b) volume of fluid (e.g. oil). This can alter frequency yet still allow power to be added independent of drill string length. The drill string can have torque and pressure placed on it without affecting the resonator or shuttling sonic head shuttle. This affords huge drilling control.<br>
The independent systems for rotor control from that of the shuttle oil supply, the vibrational isolation of the sonic head save primarily for sonic shock, the frame within a frame arrangements, and the short distance of oil shock travel bestow significant advantages.<br>
Operation of cycles as in Figures 7 to 9A will now be described with apparatus having the flow capabilities previously described. Please appreciate where such a device as shown in Figures 1 to 9A is, say, about 1.5m long the shuttle movement is of the order of, say, 0.1mm to 15mm (the amplitude), the parameters of operation affecting applitude.<br>
The operation can be a direct millisecond range movement as in scenario (A) referred to in respect of Figure 7 (i.e. Fig 8', Fig 9\ etc) but can instead be scenario (B) where conditions as in Figures 8A and 9A each requires an accumulator in the oil circuit to allow the momentary movement required to the following Figure 9 and Figure 8 instantaneous condition respectively.<br>
It is envisaged that apparatus in accordance with forms of the present invention as shown in Figures 10 to 13 will preferably be driven by a hydraulic system from, for example, an excavator (or other vehicle or a standing prime mover) and therefore the various sources of pressurised liquid and the reservoirs referred to herein are preferably those of such a supply excavator, etc. to which the apparatus can be linked. Preferably also there can<br><br>
be a diversion in the inflow to the apparatus of such pressurised hydraulic fluid through such closure and/or choke valves etc. as may be required separately to provide a hydraulic drive to the or one of the rotary valves (and thus by the timing or synchronising link in turn to the other) as well as separately the charging of the fluid alternately to each chamber end region.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figure 10 the piston 60 has extensions 61 journaled so as to allow axial movement It matters not if the piston and the journals are circular in cross section and/or whether or not they are allowed to rotate within the chamber defined by the chamber assembly 62.<br>
As can be seen in the embodiment of Figure 10 there is a first chamber end region 63 and a second chamber end region 64 each accessible to an inlet port 65 and 66 respectively.<br>
Positioned so as to rotate substantially about an axis normal to the stroke axis of the piston 60 is a rotary valve 66 having on a same radius areas of no opening 67 and openings 68.<br>
As can be seen one of these openings 68 (designated 68A) is opening the pressurised liquid supply chamber 69 of the fluid supply assembly into communication with the chamber end region 63 whilst there is no such access via the second inlet port 66 into the chamber end region 64 owing to the out of phase state, i.e.; there is a region 67 holding the second inlet port 66 closed whilst the first inlet port 65 is open. The vice versa situation onwards will allow alternate charging to each chamber end region.<br>
As shown in Figure 10 there is a first exhaust or outlet port 70 for the chamber end region 63 and a second outlet port 71 for the chamber end region 64. In a situation as shown in Figure 10 where these ports are always kept open preferably means (in this case a plate having openings 72 and 73) other than a second rotary valve ensures that the inflow of liquid via an opening 68 and a port 65 or 66 will always be at a greater rate than there is any exhausting out via the corresponding opening 72 or 73 as part of a hydraulic return circuit.<br><br>
Persons skilled in the art will appreciate how the fluid supply assembly 74 can be supplied with an infeed of a hydraulic fluid into the chamber 69 with the fluid finding its own way from there into one or other of the chamber end regions 63 and 64 and from thence via the exit ports (70 and 72 in one instance and 71 and 73) in the other instance back to the pumping system of, for example, the excavator with which the apparatus might be linked for return of that same hydraulic liquid back to the chamber 69 or such diversion thereof, as might be considered desirable, to a hydraulic motor for driving the rotary valve 66.<br>
A more preferred form of the present invention is that shown in Figure 12. This has similar to Figure 10 a piston 75 and journaled extensions 76 and 77 thereby defining chamber end regions 78 and 79 controllable by, for example, the rotary valve 80 with its openings and non openings similarly arrayed to the maimer shown by reference to the embodiment of Figure 10. The assembly 81 with its chamber 82 is adapted to receive pressurised hydraulic liquid and to selectively allow its movement into first one and then the other of the chamber end regions 79 and 79.<br>
Timed to the rotation of the rotary valve 80 is a rotary valve member<br>
83	which has the role of allowing the exhausting of hydraulic liquid from first<br>
one and then the other of the chambers 78 and 79 in an out of phase<br>
relationship to that of injection thereby to reciprocate the piston. The exhaust<br>
rotary valve 83 preferably rotates at the same speed as the rotary valve 80 and<br>
the spacings of its openings is appropriate for each outlet from the chambers<br>
78 and 79.<br>
Figure 11 best shows the arrangement of these openings with a port<br>
84	being closed by not being aligned with an opening 85 of the input rotary<br>
valve 80 whilst an outlet port 85 of that same chamber end region 86 is<br>
aligned with an opening 87 to allow outflow into the chamber 88 of the fluid<br>
collection assembly 79 from whence it is ducted back via, for example, the<br>
excavator, for pumped recycled use.<br><br>
The arrangement of Figure 13 shows in a bench test form an electric motor 90 (ideally it would be a hydraulic motor in use) driving directly a drive assembly adapted to rotate a first rotary valve (not shown) whilst a link belt 91 through an idle shaft 92 in turn through a second link belt 93 drives the other rotary valve (not shown) thereby providing the appropriate vibrational movement (caused by reciprocation of the piston) that extends into the journaled output member 94.<br>
In operation therefore appropriate tuning can occur of the vibrations required. If we assume that an excavator has a capability of providing a substantially constant hydraulic flow and pressure into the apparatus of the present invention and there is a division of the flow so that one flow can supply a hydraulic motor to achieve rotary valve rotation whilst the other flow is to charge selectively either side of the piston under the action of the rotary valve timed or synchronised movement, a very simple control regime applies. This is far less complicated with far fewer moving parts and requiring lower tolerances than for any of the prior art procedures previously disclosed.<br>
For example, if the inlet port at one end is shut by its rotary valve then the hydraulic liquid cannot go anywhere and nothing will happen by way of charging into that end region. Contrarily however the same will not be the case at the other end if that is in part or wholly open.<br>
Accordingly when an input rotary valve is turned (spun) the hydraulic oil flows into the piston chamber end region and forces the piston to the end of its stroke. The rotary valve continues to ton and through its timing or synchronism with the other rotary valve, the "spent" hydraulic oil is allowed to release to exhaust At the same time or subsequently (or both) the first rotary valve diverts oil to the other end of the piston in turn forcing the piston back<br>
The hydraulic drive through timing belts means that if the rotary valves in unison rotate slowly (say 10 rpm) the piston will shuttle very slowly but if both rotary valves are rotated at say 1000 rpm the piston could be<br><br>
moving, say, at approximately 200 times per second. Thus tuning for the various ground conditions can be achieved by the simple expediency of manipulating the speed of the synchronised rotary valves by the control of the fluid input to the hydraulic motor.<br><br><br><br><br>

a vibrational head carrying, carried by, substantially locating and/or substantially being located by the frame,<br>
wherein the vibrational head has at least some freedom(s) to move relative to the frame, and/or vice versa,<br>
and wherein the vibrational head has a shuttle and two components each component with the shuttle defining one of two variable volume chambers, the shuttle being moveable relative to each component under the action of a fluid under pressure being supplied into one<br><br>
variable volume chamber and being released from the other variable volume chamber, and vice versa,<br>
and wherein the vibrational output is not or is not to be directly or indirectly from the frame nor the shuttle,<br>
and wherein it is adapted so that if driving a drill string with the vibrational output each cycle provides a drive in and a drive out of the drill bit carried by the drill string.<br>
50.	A vibrational head assembly for generating an output (e.g. for direct or indirect<br>
vibrational input into a drill string), said assembly having<br>
a frame,<br>
as a vibrational head carrying, carried by and/or substantially locating the frame,<br>
wherein the vibrational head has (preferably at least within bounds) at least some freedom(s) to move relative to the frame, and/or vice versa,<br>
and wherein at least some of the mass ("the shuttle") of the vibrational head (inclusive of at least some of said fluid) under the action of valves and a pressurised fluid supply or pressurised fluid supplies for opposing variable volume chambers defined in part in each case by the shuttle, in use, is able to shuttle with respect to two other masses of the vibration head each of which defines in part a said chamber,<br>
and wherein it is from at least one of these other masses from which there is to be the vibrational output.<br>
51.	Vibrational apparatus comprising or including<br>
a piston,<br>
a chamber assembly defining a chamber in which the piston is adapted to shuttle rectilinearly between stroke limits, said chamber having a chamber end region at and/or beyond each stroke limit of the piston, there being an inlet port into and an outlet port out of each chamber end region,<br>
a fluid supply assembly associated with said chamber assembly capable of supplying a pressurised fluid or any pressurised fluid it may receive in use to the inlet ports of the chamber,<br><br>
a fluid collection assembly associated with said chamber assembly to collect fluid from the outlet ports (and preferably capable of supplying that collected fluid for reuse via a said source of pressurised fluid),<br>
a first rotary valve capable of an out of phase allowing or disallowing of fluid movement from the fluid supply assembly into each said inlet port by opening or closing same,<br>
a second rotary valve capable of an out of phase disallowing or allowing of fluid movement from the chamber out of each said outlet port by closing or opening same,<br>
a first drive to rotate the first rotary valve,<br>
a second drive to rotate the second rotary valve, and<br>
a timing link between the first and second drives such that, for each chamber end region, an inlet port will generally be open when its associated outlet port is closed, and vice versa, and such that, each state of the opening and closing of each end chamber end region is generally out of phase with the condition of the other,<br>
wherein in use, there is or will be a vibrational output via the first assembly, the second assembly and/or an output member of or carried by the piston as a consequence of rapid piston shuttling within the chamber.<br>
52.	In combination or assembly, (I) a rotatable drill string and (II) apparatus of any one of the preceding claims when adapted or adapted to allow vibrational drilling.<br>
53.	Pile driving, boring and/or drilling involving the use of vibrational apparatus in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 34.<br>
54.	A method for generating vibrations using<br>
a vibrational head having a housing from which the vibrational output is to be taken<br>
directly or indirectly,<br>
a shuttle to reciprocate within the housing thereby to vibrate the housing, and<br>
a drive to cause the reciprocation of the shuttle within the housing and thereby to<br>
vibrate the housing.<br>
55.	A method   for drilling using a vibrational head correctable to a rotatable drill<br>
string, the vibrational head having a housing, a shuttle and a drive,<br>
wherein the shuttle is able to be reciprocated within the housing under the action of a drive, and<br>
wherein the vibrational output into the drill string is directly from or indirectly from the housing rather than the shuttle.<br><br>
56.        A method as claimed in claim 55 wherein said method involves the steps of<br>
engaging a drill string having a down hole lead assembly to the vibrational head, the<br>
engagement not being carried by the shuttle,<br>
vibrating and rotating the drill string and its down hole assembly to advance drilling<br>
progress,<br>
detaching the drill string from the vibrational head,<br>
adding to the top of the drill string thereby to extend the drill string,<br>
engaging the extended drill string to the vibrational head, the re-engagement not<br>
being carried by the shuttle; and<br>
vibrating and rotating the extended drill string and its down hole assembly to further<br>
advance drilling progress.<br><br></td>
