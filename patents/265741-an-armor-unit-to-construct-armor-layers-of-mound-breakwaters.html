Object of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an armor unit to construct armor layers of<br>
mound breakwaters, coastal revetments and groins for shore protection in maritime<br>
and hydraulic structures.<br>
Specifically, the object of the invention is an armor unit to protect against<br>
large waves which has a basic cubic or parallelepiped shape characterized by one<br>
or more protrusions on its faces to prevent coupling between units and to increase<br>
interlocking with the underlayer of quarrystone.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The manufacture of artificial quarrystone for the construction of mound<br>
breakwaters and shore protection structures is a well-known problem. Until now,<br>
different solutions have been applied unsuccessfully, through the design of<br>
numerous armor units, generally made of concrete, to construct armor layers of<br>
mound breakwaters for protection against wind wave attack.<br>
It is worth highlighting that said concrete units for breakwater armor layers<br>
are not to be confused with those used for the construction of artificial reefs,<br>
since said armor units are designed to resist against large wave breaking and are<br>
characterized by specific features such as stability and strength while the artificial<br>
reefs are used to improve or protect marine habitats and almost any unit made of<br>
any material denser than water is considered suitable.<br>
Concrete armor units for mound breakwaters may be classified according<br>
to the design, the construction process and the resistant performance against the<br>
wave storms. There are three main methods to place armor units in the<br>
construction of an armor layer: (a) random placement, (b) placed in a single layer<br>
and (c) regular uniform placement.<br>
The armor units with random placement (a) are the conventional armor<br>
units for substituting quarrystone, which are placed in more than one single layer<br>
and basically resist by gravity. Both simple and complex armor units can be<br>
1<br>
[•<br>
AMENDED 1<br>
found within the group of random placement units.<br>
Cubic and parallelepiped blocks are simple armor units, robust, solid, easy<br>
to construct and flexible in their performance against the wave storms. Further,<br>
they do not undergo significant unit breaking fractures nor do they lose stability,<br>
and any errors in design usually increase armor erosion but rarely lead to the<br>
complete destruction of the breakwater. However, these are units which have<br>
serious drawbacks as regards face-to-face fitting, which can result in significant<br>
permeability changes when the packing density increases in the lower areas<br>
causing a displacement of armor units from the upper areas (heterogeneous<br>
packing). Face-to-face fitting can also result in a reduction in friction with the<br>
underlayer and other problems derived from a certain self-arrangement of the<br>
armor units which should be placed and maintained in a random position.<br>
The group of complex armor units with random placement includes the socalled<br>
"Tetrapod" armor units, which have a higher stability coefficient as a result<br>
of their resistance due to interlocking. Nevertheless, the ease with which these<br>
units break if they are too large is considered a major drawback. They are brittle<br>
and are not resistant to large unit movements; therefore, any error in the design<br>
wave storm may lead to the unexpected complete destruction of the breakwater<br>
in the first intense storm after construction.<br>
The group of armor units with non-random placement (b) in a single layer<br>
includes the so-called "Accropode" and "Core-Loc" armor units which have a<br>
good interlocking between units, but have a relatively brittle structural<br>
performance because when any of the units fail, a progressive failure takes<br>
place. These armor units require less concrete but they must be placed with<br>
great care. Any error in the construction or calculation of the design wave storm<br>
can lead to the total destruction of the structure.<br>
Finally, the armor units with regular uniform placement (c) may be either<br>
simple in shape like the so-called "Seabee" or "Hollow" shapes or more complex<br>
in shape such as the "Cob" or "Shed" ones. These units are usually placed in a<br>
single, uniform layer and their resistance depends fundamentally on gravity,<br>
friction and interlocking between the armor units, forming an assembly. As in the<br>
2<br>
;<br>
AMENDED 1<br>
previous case, these armor units are also quite resistant at the start of damage<br>
due to the tight interlocking between armor units, but they have a very brittle<br>
structural performance because they tend to present a progressive failure to<br>
destruction if any of the armor units fail.<br>
Focusing on the armor units with random placement, and more specifically<br>
on the mentioned cubic and parallelepiped blocks which, as stated earlier, are<br>
robust and easy to manufacture and are used along many coasts such as those of<br>
Spain, these units have serious drawbacks due to face-to-face fitting or selfpacking<br>
arrangement. The reason is the parallelepiped design tends to pack armor<br>
units in the lower areas with small movements, forming armor layers with many<br>
planar faces coupled in the critical areas at sea level, decreasing the water friction<br>
on the slope of the mound and thus allowing a higher run-up and overtopping and<br>
even the flooding of the rear side of the breakwater if the wave is very large.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
The armor unit described in the present invention, being of the cubic and<br>
parallelepiped type usually manufactured for random placement, effectively<br>
solves the aforementioned drawbacks, and is considered an excellent solution<br>
for problems related to the self-arrangement and the decrease in friction.<br>
Specifically, the improvement is achieved by means of cubic or<br>
parallelepiped armor units which feature protrusions to prevent coupling between<br>
the faces of the armor units and to diminish their tendency to self-arrangement<br>
while, at the same time, increasing the friction with the underlayer, which implies a<br>
reduction in run-up and overtopping rates.<br>
Said protrusions, which are located centered in both a length direction and<br>
a height direction on the face of the unit and which can also have different<br>
shapes, such as a frustoconical or truncated pyramidal shape. These different<br>
shapes of said protrusions provide the unit greater friction with the underlayer,<br>
made of natural or artificial quarrystone, because said protrusions tend to<br>
penetrate into the underlayer, generating a passive resistance which clearly<br>
improves the tendency of the cubic or parallelepiped blocks to place the faces<br>
3<br>
AMENDED 1<br>
parallel to the underlayer layer with an increased degree of friction between<br>
layers.<br>
In addition to the increased friction with the underlayer, the said<br>
protrusions of the armor unit prevent the face-to-face fitting caused by the<br>
movements of the armor units during the structure's lifetime, which leads to selfarrangement<br>
and reduces the porosity of the lower areas of the armor layer.<br>
Preventing the face-to-face fitting in the lower areas of the armor layer and the<br>
corresponding porosity reduction, the downward armor unit displacement is<br>
reduced as well as the displacement of armor units from the upper area, near the<br>
water level, which has an effect similar to erosion due to armor unit extraction.<br>
The reduction or suppression of the heterogeneous packing problem in the armor<br>
layer maintains the high hydraulic resistance capacity of the armor layer to armor<br>
unit extraction caused by wave attack.<br>
Finally, another advantage of the invention is related to the possible<br>
fracture or erosion of the protrusions over time which results in a conventional<br>
cubic or parallelepiped unit; therefore, at the very least the invention will have the<br>
stability and robustness features of those conventional armor units.<br>

Description of the Preferred Embodiment of the Invention<br>
In view of the indicated figures, one can easily note how the armor unit to<br>
construct armor layers of mound breakwaters of the present invention, based on a<br>
simple cubic or parallelepiped structure (2), has a series of protrusions (1) which<br>
are located centered in both a length direction and a height direction on the<br>
faces.<br>
Said protrusions (1) can likewise have different shapes such as pyramidal,<br>
conical, cylindrical, spherical, etc., as well as any shape which aims to prevent the<br>
face-to-face fitting and the corresponding self-arrangement and to increase the<br>
friction with the underlayer (3) of the armor, as seen in Figure 11.<br>
Furthermore, to obtain different degrees of separation between the armor<br>
units, said protrusions (1) can also adopt different shapes and sizes, as can be<br>
inferred by observing the figures. Alternative embodiment armor units are shown<br>
with combinations of different protrusions (1) on the same unit.<br>
5<br>
;:<br>
AMENDED 1<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the dimensions of the protrusions (1) are small<br>
compared to those of the basic cube or parallelepiped (2) armor unit because their<br>
main purpose is to prevent their face-to-face fitting, maintaining the robustness of<br>
the conventional basic unit.<br>
i-<br>
In a possible embodiment, said projections (1) have, for example, a volume<br>
such that the sum of the volumes of all is one order of magnitude less than the<br>
volume of the basic unit, in other words, less than 15%.<br>
In any case, the armor unit for the construction of the armor layer of mound<br>
breakwaters of the present invention usually has a cubic or parallelepiped<br>
fundamental structural base (2), solid, with the majority of the volume made of a<br>
heavy material, such as concrete, reinforced or prestressed concrete and the like,<br>
and protrusions (1) including only a small part of the volume of the armor unit and<br>
made of a resistant material, such as concrete or steel, among others.<br>
