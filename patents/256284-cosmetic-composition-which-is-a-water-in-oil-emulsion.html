(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br><br><br>
COSMETIC W/O EMULSIONS WITH ORGANIC SUNSCREENS AND CONJUGATED LINOLEIC ACID<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
WO 2007/073838<br><br>
PCT7EP2006/011732<br><br>
COSMETIC  W/0  EMULSIONS WITH ORGANIC  SUNSCREENS  AND  CONJUGATED  LINOLEIC ACID<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 5     The invention concerns a cosmetic emulsion composition formulated to decrease facial shine known also as gloss.<br>
Women prefer cosmetics that impart a matte appearance. The matte finish overcomes the shiny effect ] engendered by greasy skin, particularly under hot and humid conditions. 10     Absorbent fillers such as talc, silica, kaolin and other inorganic particulates have been used to achieve the effect by their optical properties.<br>
Cosmetic formulations themselves have components which contribute to the undesirable appearance of facial shine. These are usually hydrophobic ingredients which include fatty<br>
15 alcohols, fatty esters and fatty acids. These components can be minimized through use of less gloss inducing hydrophobic carriers such as the silicones. Organic sunscreens contribute to the problem. Where high levels of Sun Protection Factor (SPF) are necessary, there is no ready substitute for organic sunscreens. One approach to minimizing the level of these ingredients is reported in US 5 961 961 (Dobkowski et al.).  Therein are disclosed<br>
20 relatively viscous lotion and cream products. A boost in SPF is achieved by use of large particle size organic sunscreen agents. This allows formulating with relatively lower levels of the organic sunscreen. There is no disclosure as to whether gloss has been reduced through these measures.<br>
25 The focus of the present invention was to achieve reductions in facial gloss despite formulations which require oily components, especially organic sunscreen agents.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A cosmetic composition is provided which is a water-in-oil emulsion including: 30      (i)        from about 0.1 to about 30% by weight of a water-in-oil emulsifying silicone surfactant; (ii)       from about 0.1 to about 30% by weight of an organic sunscreen agent; and (iii)       from about 0.1 to about 10% of a conjugated linoleic acid.<br>
35      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Now it has been found that a water-in-oil cosmetic composition containing conjugated linoleic acid can decrease shine (gloss) when topically applied to the face.  Generally, oily<br><br>
WO 2007/073838<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/011732<br><br>
components including organic sunscreen agents increase shininess.  It was surprising that the conjugated linoleic acids, which are oils, acted to decrease facial shine.<br>
Conjugated Linoleic Acid 5     Conjugated linoleic acid (hereinafter referred to also as CLA) comprises a group of positional and geometric isomers of linoleic acid in which various configurations of cis and trans double bonds at positions (6,8), (7,9), (8,10), (9,11), (10,12) or (11,13) are possible. Thus, twenty-four different isomers of CLA exist.<br>
10 The invention also includes derivatives of the free acid which thus comprise conjugated linoleic acid moieties. Preferable derivatives include those derived from substitution of the carboxyl group of the acid, such as esters (e.g. retinyl esters, triglyceride esters, monoglyceride esters, diglyceride esters, phosphoesters), amides (e.g. ceramide derivatives), salts (e.g. alkali metal and alkali earth metal salts, ammonium salts), and/or<br>
15 those derived from substitution of the C18 carbon chain, such as alpha hydroxy and/or beta hydroxy derivatives.<br>
In the case of triglyceride ester derivatives, all positional isomers of CLA substituents on the glycerol backbone are included. The triglycerides must contain at least one CLA moiety. 20 For example, of the three esterifiable positions on the glycerol 'backbone, the 1 arid 2 positions may be esterified with CLA and by another lipid at position 3 or as an alternative, the glycerol backbone could be esterified by CLA at the 1 and 3 positions with another lipid at position 2.<br>
25 Wherever the term "conjugated linoleic acid" or "CLA" is used in this specification it is to be understood that the derivatives thereof comprising CLA moieties are also included. "CLA moieties" refers to CLA fatty acyl portion(s) of a CLA derivative.<br>
The isomers of greatest interest in the present cosmetic compositions are cis 9, trans 11-30 linoleic acid and trans 10, cis 12-linoleic acid. Hereinafter the term "9,11-linoleic acid" or "10,12-linoleic acid" shall mean preferentially these two main isomers, but will include lesser amounts of the remaining isomers, particularly when obtained or derived from a natural source.<br>
35 In accordance with the present invention, 9,11-linoleic acid and 10,12-linoleic acid are formulated into cosmetic preparations either as the free acid,' as individual chemical derivatives, or as combinations of free acid and derivative.<br>

WO 2007/073838<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/011732<br><br>
By "c9, t11 and t10, c12 isomer enriched CLA" is meant that at least 30% by weight of the total CLA (and/or CLA moieties) present in the composition is in the form of the cis 9, trans 11 and trans 10, cis 12 isomers. Preferably, at least 40%, most preferably at least 50%, by 5 weight of the total CLA and/or CLA moieties present in the composition, is in the form of the aforementioned isomers.<br>
The amount of the CLA present in emulsions of this invention may range from about 0.1 to about 10% by weight of the composition. More preferably the amount is from about 0.5% to 10     about 5%, and most preferably from about 1 % to about 3%.<br>
Mixed isomers of CLA are prepared by high temperature alkali treatment of safflower oil, generating CLA with equal amounts of the c9, t11 and t10, c12 CLA isomers. CLA enriched in the c9, t11 CLA is separated from the mix by selective esterification with lauryl alcohol 15 using Geotrichum Candidum as a catalyst. The enriched c9, t11 CLA is hydrolyzed and converted to the triglyceride. After the esterification step and separation the remaining CLA free acids are enriched in t10, c12 CLA.<br>
-Commercially CLA is available as Clarinol® A-80 and A-95 from Loders-Groklaan 20      Channahon, Illinois and Neobee® CLA 80 and 90 from Stepan, North Field, Illinois.<br>

Most preferred are organic sunscreens in liquid form when at ambient (25°C) temperature. Illustrative is octyl methyoxycinnamate.<br>
5     Dispersed Aqueous Phase<br>
The compositions of the present invention comprise from about 5% to about 90%, more preferably from about 30% to about 75%, and even more preferably from about 45% to about 60% of a dispersed aqueous phase. In emulsion technology, the term "dispersed phase" means that the phase exists as small particles or droplets suspended in and 10 surrounded by a continuous phase. The dispersed phase is also known as the internal or discontinuous phase. The dispersed aqueous phase is a dispersion of small aqueous particles or droplets suspended in and surrounded by the continuous silicone phase described hereinbefore.<br>
15 The aqueous phase can be water, or a combination of water and one or more water soluble or dispersible ingredients. Non-limiting examples of such 'optional ingredients include thickeners, acids, bases, salts, chelants, gums, water-soluble or dispersible alcohols and polyols, buffers, preservatives, and colorants.<br>
20     Optional Components<br>
The composition of the present invention may contain a variety of other ingredients that are conventionally used in given product types provided that they do not unacceptably alter the benefits for the invention.<br>
25 A component of the present invention may be a crosslinked silicone (organopolysiloxane) elastomer. No specific restriction exists as to the type of curable organopolysiloxane composition that can serve as starting material for the crosslinked silicone elastomer. Examples in this respect are addition reaction-curinggorganopolysiloxane compositions which cure under platinum metal catalysis by the addition reaction between SiH-containing<br>
30 diorganopolysiloxane and organopolysiloxane having silicon-bonded ' vinyl groups; condensation-curing organopolysiloxane compositions which cure in the presence of an organotin compound by a dehydrogenation reaction between hydroxyl terminated diorganopolysiloxane   and   SiH-containing    diorganopolysiloxane;    condensation-curing<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2007/073838<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/011732<br><br>
organopolysiloxane compositions which cure in the presence of an organotin compound or a titanate ester, by a condensation reaction between a hydroxy! terminated diorganopolysiloxane and a hydrolyzable organosilane (this condensation reaction is exemplified by dehydration, alcohol-liberating, oxime-liberating, amine-liberating, amide-5 liberating, carboxyl-liberating and ketone-liberating reactions); peroxide-curing organopolysiloxane compositions which thermally cure in the presence of an organoperoxide catalyst; and organopolysiloxane compositions which are cured by high-energy radiation, such as by gamma-rays, ultraviolet radiation, or electron beams.<br>
10 Addition reaction-curing organopolysiloxane compositions are preferred for their rapid curing rates and excellent uniformity of curing. A particularly preferred addition reaction-curing organopolysiloxane composition is prepared from:<br>
(A)	an organopolysiloxane having at least 2 lower alkenyl groups in each molecule;<br>
(B)	an organopolysiloxane having at least 2 silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in each 15	molecule; and<br>
(C)	a platinum-type catalyst.<br>
-The crosslinked siloxane elastomer may either be an emulsifying or non-emulsifying crosslinked organopolysiloxane elastomer or combinations thereof. The term "non-20 emulsifying," as used herein, defines crosslinked organopolysiloxane elastomer from which; polyoxyalkylene units are absent. The term "emulsifying," as used herein, means crosslinked organopolysiloxane elastomer having at least one polyoxyalkylene (e.g. polyoxyethylene or polyoxypropylene) unit.<br>
25 Particularly useful emulsifying elastomers are polyoxyalkylene-modified elastomers formed from divinyl compounds, particularly siloxane polymers with at least two free vinyl groups, reacting with Si-H linkages on a polysiloxane backbone. Preferably, the elastomers are dimethyl polysiloxanes crosslinked by Si-H sites on a molecularly spherical MQ resin.<br>
30 Preferred silicone elastomers are organopolysiloxane compositions available under the INCI names of dimethicone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer, dimethicone crosspolymer and Polysilicone-11. Ordinarily these materials are provided as a 1-30% crosslinked silicone elastomer dissolved or suspended in a dimethicone fluid (usually cyclomethicone). For purposes of definition "crosslinked silicone elastomer" refers to the elastomer alone rather<br>
35 than the total commercial compositions which also include a solvent (eg dimethicone) carrier.<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2007/073838	PCT7EP2006/011732<br>
Dimethicone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymers and dimethicone crosspolymers are available from a variety of suppliers including Dow Coming (9040, 9041, 9045, 9506 and 9509), General Electric (SFE 839), Shin Etsu (KSG-15, 16, 18 [dimethicone/phenyl vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer]) and Grant Industries (Gransil™ line of materials), and lauryl 5 dimethicone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymers supplied by Shin Etsu (e.g. KSG-31, KSG-32, KSG-41, KSG-42, KSG-43 and KSG-44).<br>
Other suitable commercially available silicone elastomer powders include vinyl dimethicone/methicone silesquioxane crosspolymers from Shin Etsu sold as KSP-100, KSP-10 101, KSP-102, KSP-103, KSP-104 and KSP-105, and hybrid silicone powders that contain a fluoroalkyl group or a phenyl group sold by Shin Etsu as respectively KSP-200 and KSP-300. Also of use is Dow Coming 5-7070, a silicone amino elastomer emulsion with INCI name of silicone quatemium-16/glycidoxy dimethicone crosspolymer (and) trideceth-12.<br>
15 The crosslinked silicone elastomers may range in concentration from about 0.01 to about 30%, preferably from about 0.1 to about 10%, optimally from about 0.5 to about 2% by weight of the cosmetic composition. These weight values exclude any solvent such as cyclomethicone found in commercial "elastomer" silicones such as the Dow Coming products 9040 and 9045, For instance, the amount of crosslinked silicone elastomer in 9040<br>
20     and9045isbetweeni12jandf13%byweighti<br>
Most preferred as the silicone elastomer is  Dow-Coming  9045 which  has a  D5 cyclomethicone swelled elastomer particle size (based on volume and calculated as spherical particles) which averages about 38 micron, and may range from about 25 to about 25      55 micron.<br>
The compositions may include from about 1% to about 80%, by weight of the composition, of a suitable carrier for the crosslinked organopolysiloxane elastomer component described above. The carrier, when combined with the crosslinked organopolysiloxane elastomer 30 particles serves to suspend and swell the elastomer particles to provide an elastic, gel-like network or matrix. The carrier for the crosslinked siloxane elastomer is liquid under ambient conditions, and preferably has a low viscosity to provide for improved spreading on the skin.<br>
The concentration of the carrier may range from about 5% to about 60%, more preferably 35     from about 5% to about 40%, by weight of the composition.<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2007/073838	PCT/EP2006/011732<br>
These liquid carriers may be organic, silicone-containing or fluorine-containing, volatile or non-volatile, polar or non-polar, provided that the liquid carrier forms a solution or other homogeneous liquid or liquid dispersion with the selected cross-linked siloxane elastomer at the selected siloxane elastomer concentration at a temperature of from about 28°C to about 5 250°C, preferably from about 28°C to about 78°C. The term "non-polar" typically means that the material has a solubility parameter below about 6.5 (cal/cm3)°5.<br>
The non-polar, volatile oil tends to impart highly desirable aesthetic properties to the compositions' of the present invention.    Consequently, the non-polar, volatile oils are<br>

EXAMPLE VI<br>
A study on gloss was conducted. The method employed for the study was as follows.<br>
15<br>
Method for In-vitro Optical Properties Measurement<br>
Intrinsic optical properties of the formulas as films were measured using a Hunter Lab - Lab Scan XE (Hunter Associates Laboratory, Inc. Reston, Vinginia)'ahd'S^tistica'rGiossmeter-Novo Gloss (Paul N. Gardner Company, Inc. Pompano Beach, Florida) on Leneta black and<br>
20 white draw-down card form 2A-Opacity (The Leneta Company, Mahwah, New Jersey). A 3ml film casting applicator (Paul N. Gardner Company, Inc. Pompano Beach, Florida) was used to cast about 75 \i product films on the draw-down cards. First, about 3-5 grams of the test formula was filled into the gap of the applicator on the draw-down card. The applicator was held and moved over products smoothly to get uniform product films. These films were<br>
25 dried in an air-conditioned room (temperature circa 22 CC) for 12 hours. By following the measurement procedure specified in the instrument menu and commercially supplied computer software, opacity (hiding power) and colors (a*, b* and L*) were measured using Lab Scan XE. Gloss data of the films were measured using Novo Gloss at 60 degrees. The opacity data in percentage value is the measurement of hiding power of the test film needed<br>
30 to cover the black background on the draw-down card. Complete opacity (100%) means that no black background can be seen through the test film. The color measurement is presented by Hunter lab color space a*, b* and L*. Term a* is green-red space, term b* is blue-yellow space and L* is black-white space. For example a larger L* value means more white, and smaller b* value means more blue. Gloss is reported as g-u (Gloss unit). This unit relates to<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2007/073838	PCT/EP2006/011732<br>
light intensity reflected from the surface of the test film. A higher value of gloss means a more shining film.<br>
Opacity is measured by the percentage ratio of product film whiteness on the black 5     background (L*B) to whiteness on the white background (L*W).   Thus, the value "y" is a measure of opacity on the whiteness axis.<br>
Compositions used in the study were formulated as reported in table 3.<br>
