DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The  embodiments  of  the  present  invention will  be described  below  in  conjunction  with  the  accompanying drawings. First Embodiment:<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic block diagram showing a common rail type fuel injector system in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In the drawing, an engine 1 is a four-cylinder diesel engine of four strokes. The combustion chamber of each cylinder of the engine 1 has an injector 2 serving as an injection nozzle. An injection control solenoid valve 3 provided in each of the four injectors 2 is opened or closed to control the injection of fuel into the engine 1. A common rail 4 is a high pressure accumulator pipe common to all cylinders of the engine 1. The four injectors 2 are connected to the common rail 4, and the fuel in the common rail 4 is injected through the injectors 2 to the engine 1 when the injection control solenoid valves 3 are opened. The common rail 4 is connected to a check valve 6 provided on a high pressure supply pump 7 via a supply pipe 5. The high pressure supply pump 7 is driven by a cam driving mechanism 8 of the pump which will be described later in conjunction with Fig. 2 so as to deliver or forcibly feed the high pressure fuel to the common rail 4. The high pressure supply pump 7 is equipped with a spill control<br><br>
solenoid valve 9. The fuel is supplied to the high pressure supply pump 7 from a fuel tank 11 by a low pressure supply pump 10.<br>
An electronic control unit 12 serving as the control means turns ON/OFF the injection control solenoid valves 3 and the spill control solenoid valve 9. The electronic control unit 12 receives the information on the speed and load of the engine 1 and the common rail pressure through an engine speed sensor 13, a load sensor 14, and a pressure sensor 15 which detects the common rail pressure. Specifically, in the common rail type fuel injector system, the information on the speed and load of the engine and the common rail pressure are supplied from the respective sensors 13, 14, and 15 to the electronic control unit 12 which controls a high pressure common rail system.<br>
The electronic control unit 12 carries out negative feedback control of the common rail pressure while at the same time outputs a control signal to the injection control solenoid valves 3 so that the injection timing and the injection amount are adjusted to the optimum conditions which are determined according to the state of the engine 1 which is judged by signals indicative of the information mentioned above. The unit 12 also sends a control signal to the spill control solenoid valve 9, thereby adjusting the common rail pressure to an optimum injection pressure level.<br>
For instance, a certain amount of fuel in the common rail 4 whose pressure has been accumulated to 100 MPa is consumed each time the injection control solenoid valves 3 is opened by a control pulse.   To compensate for the<br><br>
consumed  fuel,   the  high  pressure  supply  pump  7 intermittently delivers the fuel to the common rail 4 by the amount required to compensate for the consumed amount in order to maintain the common rail pressure at the same 100 MPa level at all times.  The required delivery amount varies depending on the injection amount or engine speed. Therefore, the amount of one delivery of the high pressure supply pump 7 is adjusted by controlling the operation of the spill control solenoid valve 9 by the electronic control unit 12,   To perform the high pressure supply, maintenance,  and  control,  the  fuel  is  supplied  in synchronization with a single operation cycle of the fuel Injector system, that is, for every injection. Therefore, a jerk type pump, which intermittently reciprocates and which is capable of performing the same delivery cycles of fuel as the number of combustion cycles of the engine 1, is employed for the high pressure supply pump 7.<br>
The high pressure supply pump 7 will now be described with reference to Fig. 2.<br>
In Fig. 2, a cam chamber 80 of the pump driving mechanism 8 is provided at the bottom end of a pump housing 70 and a cylinder 71 is installed in the pump housing 70. A plunger 72 is installed in the cylinder 71 in such a manner that it can reciprocate and slide therein. The top end surface of the plunger 72 and the inner peripheral surface of the cylinder 71 constitute a pump chamber 73 which is communicated with the check valve 5 via a discharge port 74 serving as a communicating passage. The high pressure supply pump 7 is provided with a fuel reservoir 75 to which the low pressure fuel is supplied by the low pressure fuel pump 10 from the fuel<br><br>
tank 11 via an introduction pipe 76. The fuel reservoir 75 and the spill control solenoid valve 9 are communicated through a passage 77. A valve seat 78 connected at the bottom end of the plunger 72 is pressed against a cam follower 81 by a plunger spring 79 and a cam roller 82 is provided on the cam follower 81. A cam 83 is secured to a driving shaft 84 and is rotatably disposed in the cam chamber 80. The cam 83 is slidably in contact with the cam roller 82, the outer periphery thereof having a shape formed by four identical hills or carving projections. The driving shaft 84 of the cam 83 rotates at a half speed of the engine 1.<br>
Hence, when the cam 83 is rotated by the rotary shaft 84 of the cam 83, the plunger 72 starts reciprocating motion via the cam roller 82, the cam follower 81, and the valve seat 78. The reciprocating stroke of the plunger 72 is determined by the difference in height between the top and bottom of the hills. As the plunger 72 reciprocates in the cylinder 71, the fuel on the low pressure side is taken into the pump chamber 73. The fuel which has been taken in is forcibly fed or delivered when the spill control solenoid valve 9, which will be discussed in detail later, is closed. When the solenoid valve is opened, some portion of the fuel is returned to the low pressure end.<br>
The spill control solenoid valve 9 will now be described with reference to Fig. 2.<br>
A body 91 has a passage 92 which is communicated with the passage 77 formed on the cylinder 71. A valve seat 93 is provided on the body 91 on the side closer to the pump chamber 73.  An electromagnetic coil 94 which is energized<br><br>
via a lead wire 95 is provided on the top of the body 91. An armature 96 is drawn upward in Fig. 2 by the magnetic force of the energized electromagnetic coil 94 against the urging force of a spring 97. An outward opening valve 98 is connected to the armature 96 into one unit, and when the electromagnetic coil 94 is de-energized, the valve 98 is brought down to the bottom in Fig. 2 by the elastic force of the spring 97, causing the passage 92 to be communicated with the pump chamber 73. When the electromagnetic coil 94 is energized, the valve 98 is brought back in the valve seat 93 to shut off the passage between the passage 92 and the pump chamber 73. A stopper 99 is provided on the cylinder 71 to decide the bottom position of the outward opening valve 98. The stopper 99 comes in contact with the bottom end of the outward opening valve 98 to restrict the position of the outward opening valve 98 when the electromagnetic coil 94 is de-energized, and it is provided with a plurality of through holes 99a through which fuel can flow.<br>
The spill control solenoid valve 9 is a pre-stroke control type solenoid valve for setting the timing at which the outward opening valve 98 is seated on the valve seat 93 to start the pressurization of the plunger 72.<br>
The schematic configuration of the high pressure supply pump 7 and the pump driving mechanism 8 will now be described with reference to Fig. 3.<br>
In Fig. 3, a rotary disc 85 is coaxially attached to the driving shaft 84 of the cam 83. The rotary disc 85 has four projections 85a which respectively correspond to the engine cylinders. A cam angle sensor 16 which is an electromagnetic pickup is disposed facing against one of<br><br>
f<br>
the projection 85a, so that every time one of the projection 85a passes near the cam angle sensor 16, a signal is sent to the electronic control unit 12. A cylinder identifying rotary disc 86 which has a single projection 86a is coaxially attached to the driving shaft 84 of the cam 83. A cylinder identifying sensor 17 is disposed facing against the projection 86a. Every time the projection 86a passes near the cylinder identifying sensor 17, that is, each time the high pressure supply pump 7 makes one reciprocating movement, one signal is sent to the electronic control unit 12. Based on the signals received from the cam angle sensor 16 and the cylinder identifying sensor 17, the electronic control unit 12 judges a bottom dead center of the plunger 72 of the high pressure supply pump 7.<br>
In the configuration shown in Fig. 3, when the plunger 72, which is reciprocated by the rotation of the driving shaft 84, comes down, the spill control solenoid valve 9 is open and the fuel is introduced into the pump chamber 73 via the low pressure supply pump 10 and the spill control solenoid valve 9 from the fuel tank 11. When the plunger 72 goes up, it attempts to pressurize the fuel in the pump chamber 73. At this time, if the spill control solenoid valve 9 is not energized, then the outward opening valve 98 is apart from the valve seat 93 and the valve 9 is opened, and the fuel in the pump chamber 73 overflows via fuel passages 92, 77, the fuel reservoir 75, and the introduction pipe 76 in the order in which they are listed.<br>
When a control pulse is sent to the spill control solenoid valve 9 to energize the spill control solenoid<br><br>
valve 9, the outward opening valve 98 is seated in the valve seat 93 and the valve 9 is closed. This causes the plunger 72 to pressurize the fuel in the pump chamber 73. As soon as the fuel pressure in the pump chamber 73 overcomes the urging force of the spring 61 disposed on the check valve 6, the fuel delivered via the discharge port 74 pushes a valve 62 open, so that the fuel is delivered into the common rail 4.<br>
The operation of the fuel injector system in accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Figs. 3 and 4.<br>
The timing chart of Fig. 4 is indicative of the operation of the high pressure supply pump 7 for the period of one rotation of the pump, i.e., for the period of 360-degree rotation of the cam.<br>
In Fig. 4, (A) indicates the signal of the cylinder identifying sensor 17 and (B) indicates the signal of the cam angle sensor 15. Based on the signals received from the two sensors 16 and 17, the electronic control unit 12 determines and inputs a signal indicative of the bottom dead center of the plunger 72 of the high pressure supply pump 7. (C) indicates the lift amount of the cam 83 and (D) denotes the control signal of the spill control solenoid valve 9. In the high pressure supply pump 7, four delivery strokes which the fuel delivery is possible take place so as to respectively correspond to the engine cylinders while the driving shaft 84 makes one complete rotation.<br>
When the cam 83 is rotated and when a time Ti has passed from the trailing edge of a cam angle signal C| ,<br><br>
namely when the plunger 72 has arrived at the bottom dead center thereof, the electronic control unit 12 sends a control signal to the spill control solenoid valve 9, and the control signal is cut off at the trailing edge of the following cam angle signal C2, namely when the plunger 72 has arrived at the top dead center thereof. While the control signal is being applied, the spill control solenoid valve 9 is held closed. Thus, the fuel in the pump chamber 73 which has been pressurized by the plunger 72 for a cam lift amount Hi after the solenoid valve 9 was closed (indicated by the hatched sections in Fig. 4) flows into the common rail 4 via the check valve 6 and it is accumulated in the common rail 4.<br>
Similarly, the control signal is sent to the spill control solenoid valve 9 from the electronic control unit 12 when the time Ti has passed from the trailing edge of the cam angle signal C3 and the control signal is cut off at the trailing edge of the following cam signal C4.<br>
Thus, in the first embodiment, two cycles of pumping or delivery are implemented during one rotation of the driving shaft 84 of the cam 83 and the spill control solenoid valve 9 is held closed during the full period of delivery strokes, in which the fuel delivery is possible, so as to pressurize the fuel in the pump chamber 73 and accumulate it in the common rail 4. The delivery stroke during which the fuel delivery is possible means the rising stroke of the plunger 72 moving from the bottom dead center to the top dead center of the plunger 72. This corresponds to the rising slope sections in the waveform (C) shown in Fig. 4.<br>
Further, the delivery amount of the fuel required for<br><br>
generating or maintaining the common rail pressure can be controlled according to the load on the engine by adjusting the number (0"-4) of the delivery strokes during one rotation of the driving shaft 84 of the cam 83 in accordance with the engine speed detected by the speed sensor 13, the engine load detected by the load sensor 14, or the common rail pressure detected by the pressure sensor 15, thereby permitting the desired common rail pressure to be reached.<br>
Then, in the case that the electronic control unit 12 sends control signals to the spill control solenoid valve 9 when the time Tj has passed from each trailing edges of cam angle signals Cj, C2, C3, and C4, four cycles of pump delivery are implemented during one rotation of the driving shaft 84 of the cam 83, thereby increasing the delivery amount of fuel. On the other hand, in the case that electronic control unit 12 sends no control signals to the spill control solenoid valve 9 even if cam angle signals Ci , C2 , C3 , and C4 are generated, the spill control solenoid valve 9 is not energized. Hence, the fuel in the pump chamber 73 is put back to the low pressure side, since it is not pressurized, no fuel will be delivered to the common rail 4.<br>
According to the first embodiment, the electronic control unit 12 holds the spill control solenoid valve 9 closed (fully closed) or opened (fully open) throughout the full period of all four delivery strokes of the high pressure supply pump 7, during which the delivery is possible, in accordance with the engine speed detected by the speed sensor 13, the engine load detected by the load sensor 14, or the common rail pressure detected by the<br><br>
pressure sensor 15, thereby permitting the desired common rail pressure to be reached.<br>
Therefore, complicated control is no longer necessary to control the opening and closing operation of the spill control solenoid valve 9, thus permitting extremely easy control thereof.<br>
Second Embodiment:<br>
In the first embodiment described above, the high pressure supply pump 7, the cam 83, the cam roller 82, the spill control solenoid valve 9, etc. are provided one each. In this embodiment, however, these components are provided two each sharing the same capacities and shapes, namely, high pressure supply pumps 7 and 7A, cams 83 and 83A, cam rollers 82 and 82A, spill control solenoid valves 9 and 9A.<br>
In the second embodiment, the two cams 83 and 83A are formed to have the same shape and lift amount and they are rotated in synchronization with each other as illustrated in Figs. 5 and 6. Therefore, when the time Ti has passed from the trailing edges of the cam angle signals Ci and C3 , respectively, the electronic control unit 12 sends a control signal to the spill control solenoid valve 9. Thereby, the spill control solenoid valve 9 is closed. These control signals are respectively cut off at the trailing edges of the following cam angle signals C2 and C4. Thereby, the spill control solenoid valve 9 is opened.<br>
When the time Ti has passed from the trailing edges of the cam angle signals C2 and C4, respectively, the electronic control unit 12 sends a control signal to the<br><br>
spill control solenoid valve 9A. Thereby, the spill control solenoid valve 9A is closed. These control signals are respectively cut off at the trailing edges of the following cam angle signals C3 and Ci. Thereby, the spill control solenoid valve 9A is opened.<br>
According to the second embodiment, the spill control solenoid valves 9 and 9A are closed (fully closed) or opened (fully open) in accordance with the engine speed, the engine load, or the common rail pressure. Thereby, the delivery amount of the fuel required for generating or maintaining the desired common rail pressure can be controlled and the desired common rail pressure can be maintained.<br>
Third embodiment:<br>
In the second embodiment described above, the change in the lift amount of the cams 83 is in synchronization with the change in the lift amount of the cam 83A, whereas in this embodiment, the change in the lift amount of the cams 83 is not in synchronization with the change in the lift amount of the cam 83A as illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8.<br>
Namely, in Figs. 7 and 8, the two cams 83 and 83A are coaxially mounted on the rotary shaft 84, but shifted by 45 degrees in angle in the rotational direction thereof. These cams 83 and 83A respectively rotate in slidable contact with the cam rollers 82 and 82A. Further, a rotary disc 85A coaxially attached to the driving shaft 84 of the cams 83 and 83A has eight projections 85a which are formed on the outer periphery at equal angular intervals in the circumferential direction.<br><br>
In the fuel injector system thus configured, eight cam angle signals Ci~Cg are generated as illustrated in Fig. 8. When the time Tj has passed from the trailing edges of the cam angle signals Cj and C5, respectively, ( namely, at the trailing edges of the cam angle signals C2 and Cg, ) the electronic control unit 12 sends a control signal to the spill control solenoid valve 9. Thereby, the spill control solenoid valve 9 is closed. These control signals are respectively cut off at the trailing edges of the following cam angle signals C3 and C7 . Thereby, the spill control solenoid valve 9 is opened.<br>
On the other hand, when the time Ti has passed from the trailing edges of the cam angle signals C2 and Ce , respectively, ( namely, at the trailing edges of the cam angle signals C3 and C7, ) the electronic control unit 12 sends a control signal to the spill control solenoid valve 9A. Thereby, the spill control solenoid valve 9A is closed. These control signals are respectively cut off at the trailing edges of the following cam angle signals C4 and Cs . Thereby, the spill control solenoid valve 9A is opened.<br>
According to the third embodiment, the lift amounts of the cams 83 and 83A are shifted by 45 degrees in angle in the rotational direction from each other. Therefore, the fuel delivery timings at which the high pressure supply pumps 7 and 7A deliver the fuel into the common rale 4 are shifted by 45 degrees in angle in the rotational direction from each other. Namely, the fuel delivery timing of the high pressure supply pimp 7 for the common rail 4 is synchronized with the fuel injection timing of the injection control  solenoid valve 3  for the respective<br><br>
cylinders of the engine 1. Further, the fuel delivery timing of the high pressure supply pimp 7A for the common rail 4 is not synchronized with the fuel injection timing of the injection control solenoid valve 3.<br>
In the third embodiment, since the number of pump delivery strokes is selected among the eight pump delivery strokes according to the load on the engine 1, the amplitude of a pressure wave per one delivery becomes smaller. Further, owing to the intermittent pump delivery, the interval or cycle of the pressure waves is not constant.<br>
Therefore, the fuel injector system of the third embodiment can restrain an enlargement of the fluctuations in the common rail pressure generated by overlapping the fluctuations in the common rail pressure caused by the fuel injection of the injection control solenoid valve 3 and the delivery pressure of the high pressure supply pumps 7 and 7A and a microseisums in the common rail pressure caused by a water hammer originated in the sudden closing of the injection control solenoid valve 3.<br>
Fourth embodiment:<br>
In the third embodiment described above, the two cams 83 and 83A are formed to have the same shape and are coaxially mounted on the rotary shaft 84, but shifted by 45 degrees in angle in the rotational direction thereof, whereas, in this embodiment shown in Figs. 9 and 10, a cam 83B is mounted on the rotary shaft 84 instead of the cam 83A, the outer periphery thereof having a triangle shape formed by three identical hills as illustrated in Fig. 9. Then, the lift amount H2 of the cam 83B is equal to the<br><br>
lift amount Hi of the cam 83.<br>
In the fuel injector system thus configured, four cam angle signals Ci~C4 are generated as illustrated in Fig. 10. When the time Tj has passed from the trailing edges of the cam angle signals Ci and Cj, respectively, the electronic control unit 12 sends a control signal to the spill control solenoid valve 9. Thereby, the spill control solenoid valve 9 is closed. These control signals are respectively cut off at the trailing edges of the following cam angle signals C2 and C4. Thereby, the spill control solenoid valve 9 is opened.<br>
On the other hand, when the time T2 has passed from the trailing edge of the cam angle signal C, , that is, when the plunger 72 of the pump 7A has arrived at the bottom dead center thereof, the electronic control unit 12 sends a control signal to the spill control solenoid valve 9A. Thereby, the spill control solenoid valve 9A is closed. When the time T3 has passed from the trailing edge of the following cam angle signal C2 , that is, when the plunger 72 of the pump 7A has arrived at the top dead center thereof, the control signal is cut off. Thereby, the spill control solenoid valve 9A is opened.<br>
According to the fourth embodiment, the lift amount changes of the cams 83 and 83B are not synchronized and are shifted each other. Further, the delivery amounts of the fuel indicated by the hatched sections in Fig. 10 differ each other.<br>
Therefore, the fuel injector of the fourth embodiment can easily restrain the enlargement of the fluctuations in the common rail pressure generated by overlapping the fluctuations  in  the  common  rail  pressure  and  the<br><br>
microseisums in the common rail pressure as compared with the third embodiment.<br>
Fifth embodiment:<br>
This fifth embodiment will be described with reference to Figs. 11 and 12.<br>
In Figs. 11 and 12, the pump capacity of a high pressure supply pump 7a is smaller than that of the high pressure supply pump 7. A cylinder 71a is installed in the pump housing of the high pressure supply pump 7a. A plunger 72a is installed in the cylinder 71a in such a manner that it can reciprocate and slide therein. The top end surface of the plunger 72a and the inner peripheral surface of the cylinder 71a constitute a pump chamber 73a which is communicated with the check valve 6 via a discharge port 74a serving as a communicating passage. The plunger 72a is pressed against a cam roller 82a by a plunger spring 79a<br>
The outer periphery of a cam 83C has a shape formed by four identical hills. The cam 83C is mounted on the rotary shaft 84 in such a manner that hills of the cam 83C are synchronized with hills of the cam 83. Although not precisely illustrated, the maximal lift amount H4 of the cams 83C is one half of the maximal lift amount Hi of the cam 83.<br>
In the fuel injector system thus configured, four cam angle signals Ci-C^ are generated as illustrated in Fig. 12. When the time Ti has passed from the trailing edges of the cam angle signals Ci and C3, respectively, the electronic control unit 12 sends a control signal to the spill control solenoid valve 9. Thereby, the spill control<br><br>
solenoid valve 9 is closed. These control signais are respectively cut off at the trailing edges of the following cam angle signals C2 and C4. Thereby, the spill control solenoid valve 9 is opened.<br>
On the other hand, when the time Tj has respectively passed from the trailing edges of the cam angle signals C2 and C4 , namely, when the plunger 72a has arrived at the top dead center thereof, the electronic control unit 12 sends a control signal to the spill control solenoid valve 9B. Thereby, , the spill control solenoid valve 9B is closed. These control signals are respectively cut off at the trailing edges of the following cam angle signals C3 and C] , namely, when the plunger 72a has arrived at the top dead center thereof. Thereby, the spill control solenoid valve 9B is opened.<br>
According to the fifth embodiment, the lift changes of the cams 83 and 83C are synchronized and the pump delivery amount of the fuel of the high pressure supply pump 7 differs from the delivery amount of the fuel of the high pressure supply pump 7a. The electronic control unit 12 holds the spill control solenoid valves 9 and 9B closed or opened throughout the full period of all delivery strokes of the pumps 7 and 7a. Thus, the numbers of delivery strokes during which the spill control solenoid valves 9 and 9B are closed are controlled to adjust each of the delivery amounts of the pumps 7 and 7a, thereby adjusting the common rail pressure to a desired pressure. Further, the pump 7a is miniaturized and the torque required for driving the pump 7a is reduced, thereby minimizing the installation space thereof.<br><br>
Sixth embodiment:<br>
This sixth embodiment will be described with reference to Figs. 13 and 14.<br>
The outer periphery of a cam 83D has a shape formed by eight identical hills. The cam 83D is mounted on the rotary shaft 84 and causes the plunger 72 of one high pressure supply pump 7 to make a reciprocating motion.<br>
In the fuel injector system thus configured, eight cam angle signals Ci~C8 are generated as illustrated in Fig. 14. When the time Ti has respectively passed from the trailing edges of the cam angle signals Cj , C3 , C5 and C7 , namely, when the plunger 72 has arrived at the bottom dead center thereof, the electronic control unit 12 sends a control signal to the spill control solenoid valve 9. Thereby, the spill control solenoid valve 9 is closed. These control signals are respectively cut off at the trailing edges of the following cam angle signals C2, C4, Cs and Ca, namely, when the plunger 72 has arrived at the top dead center thereof. Thereby, the spill control solenoid valve 9 is opened.<br>
According to the sixth embodiment, each time the rotary shaft 84 makes one turn, the fuel can be delivered from the high pressure supply pump 7 to the common rail 4 eight times at its maximum. The times of the fuel delivery can be controlled according to the engine speed, the engine load, or the common rail pressure. Therefore, the delivery amount of the fuel required for generating or maintaining the desired common rail pressure can be controlled by one high pressure supply pump 7. Further, it can minutely control the delivery amount of the fuel and can accurately control the common rail pressure to the<br><br>
I<br>
desired pressure.<br>
In the embodiments described above, the opening and closing operation of the spill control solenoid valve is controlled according to parameters of the engine including the engine speed, the engine load, the common rail pressure, etc. Especially, it controls the full opening period and the full closing period of the spill control solenoid valve, that is, the number of delivery cycles to bring the output signal of the pressure sensor 15 . for detecting the pressure in the common rail 4 to a predeterminate.. value according to the engine speed and the engine load.<br>
In the embodiments described above, the driving shaft 84 rotates at a half speed of that of the engine 1. The speed of the driving shaft 84, however, is not limited to the half speed of the engine 1. It is acceptable that the driving shaft rotates at a speed of one and half speed of the engine 1.<br>

Further, it has a plunger for pressurizing the fuel in<br><br>
the pump chamber and a cam for driving the plunger, while a plurality of the cams is secured to the driving shaft driven by the engine. Therefore, the number of hills formed on the cam can be reduced, enhancing the productivity of the cam.<br>
