CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2007-25507, filed<br>
on February 5,2007, and Japanese Patent Application No. 2007-268857, filed on October<br>
16,2007, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
Apparatuses consistent with the present invention relate to electronic devices<br>
such as portable telephones, portable personal computers, and the like, in which a<br>
plurality of enclosures having circuits are installed so as to enable relative displacement,<br>
and the circuits within these enclosures are electrically connected by means of micro-<br>
coaxial cables or other wiring, as well as to a harness for use in wiring between<br>
enclosures of such electronic devices.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
In recent years, electronic devices such as portable telephones have made rapid<br>
advances toward compactness, lighter weight, and greater functionality. Current<br>
technical trends include an increased demand for micro-coaxial cable assemblies in place<br>
of flexible printed circuit boards (hereafter referred to as "FPCs") as internal wiring<br>
members of portable telephones . This is due to the fact that the transmission<br>
characteristics and noise resistance of micro-coaxial cables is well-suited to marked<br>
demands. Further, wiring methods are being sought which enable use even in<br><br>
mechanical constructions which had previously been regarded as ill-suited to micro-<br>
coaxial cables.<br>
Conventional micro-coaxial cable assemblies have been adopted in place of FPCs<br>
as internal wiring members of portable telephones. The mechanical construction of<br>
portable telephones in which micro-coaxial cable assemblies are used include the open-<br>
close construction called a "clamshell" type device as shown in FIG- 13A; the rotating<br>
construction called a "jackknife" type device as shown in FIG. 13B; and a dual-axis<br>
construction enabling both rotation and opening/closing called a "twist" type device as<br>
shown in FIG. 13C. However, there has been no use of micro-coaxial cable assemblies<br>
in a parallel-displacement construction called a "sliding" type device such as shown in<br>
FIG. 13D.<br>
Characteristics sought in a sliding-type construction include horizontal flexing in<br>
a space 3 mm in height. In the related art, only FPCs, with a thin-sheet construction,<br>
have been compatible with such a construction. FIG. 14 illustrates an example of a case<br>
of application of an FPC 4 as a member for wiring between enclosures of a sliding-type<br>
electronic device 1. In this electronic device 1, the circuits of a first enclosure 2, and of a<br>
second enclosure 3 slidably mounted on the first enclosure 2, are electrically connected<br>
by the FPC 4.<br>
Examples of technology related to multi-core cables used in micro-coaxial cable<br>
assemblies and the like are disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Applications, First<br>
Publication Nos. 2005-235690 and 2005-141923.<br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2005-235690,<br>
discloses a multi-core cable wherein both end portions of a plurality of conductors are<br>
arranged in a flat shape with a prescribed pitch, and the central portion is bundled into a<br>
single cable.<br><br>
Japanese Unexamined Pateat Application, First Publication No. 2005-141923,<br>
discloses a multi-core cable wherein a weft is woven among a plurality of conductors,<br>
and by means of contraction of the weft, the conductors are bundled into an<br>
approximately round shape.<br>
However, the above technologies of the related art have the following problems.<br>
As shown in FIG. 14, in a sliding-type electronic device employing FPCs as<br>
wiring members between enclosures, transmission characteristics and noise resistance are<br>
inadequate. Further, because the FPC is flexed in a small space, there is the possibility<br>
that creases and bending may occur in the FPC, which may worsen the transmission<br>
characteristics.<br>
As previously explained, if a micro-coaxial cable is used as a wiring member<br>
between enclosures in a sliding-type electronic device, transmission characteristics and<br>
noise resistance may be improved compared with cases in which FPCs are used as wiring<br>
members. However, the harness constructions of the related art disclosed in Japanese<br>
Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2005-235690 and No. 2005-<br>
141923 are used in clamshell-type and jackknife-type constructions, and cannot be<br>
applied to sliding-type constructions. The harness constructions of the related art are<br>
constructions in which a plurality of cables are bundled, and so the 3 mm height of<br>
flexing space required by sliding-type constructions cannot be maintained.<br>
FIG. 15 is a reference diagram showing the wiring structure in a sliding-type<br>
electronic device of the related art. Sliding-type electronic device 5 comprises a first<br>
enclosure 6 having a first connection portion 8, and a second enclosure 7 slidably<br>
mounted on the first enclosure 6 having a second connection portion 9- In sliding-type<br>
electronic device 5, each connection portion is provided such that the wires connecting<br>
the first connection portion 8 and second connection portion 9 axe parallel to the direction<br><br>
of enclosure displacement 10 (the enclosure sliding direction). When a harness (not<br>
shown) is used as the wiring member between enclosures, wiring is performed at the<br>
harness wiring position indicated by the symbol 10A.<br>
In general, micro-coaxial cables used in portable telephones range from American<br>
Wire Gauge (AWG) 46 to AWG 42 where the cable external diameter is approximately<br>
0.2 mm to 0.3 mm. The flexing spaces used in sliding-type constructions generally have<br>
a height of approximately 3 mm, so that flexing resistance of approximately 100,000<br>
cycles or more is required.<br>
In general, the allowable bending radius of micro-coaxial cables must be a<br>
bending radius equal to approximately 20 times the conductor diameter. When the cable<br>
diameter is approximately 0.2 mm to 0.3 mm, and is for example 0.25 mm, an allowable<br>
bending radius of approximately 5 mm is required. Thus, the 3 mm flexing space<br>
required for general sliding-type constructions would not be not satisfied.<br>
Further, related art harnesses disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application, First Publication No. 2005-235690 and in Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application, First Publication No. 2005-141923, numerous cables are bundled together,<br>
and these are connected at the wiring position indicated by the symbol 10A in FIG. 15.<br>
When the enclosure 7 is slid, flexing results in the space of a height of 3 mm so that the<br>
cable is creased and flexing resistance performance is further decreased.<br>
Maintaining the required flat shape of the harness cables presents other problems.<br>
For example, when a harness configured without a bundling member is flexed, the flat<br>
shape cannot be preserved due to cable creasing and stretching.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide a sliding-type<br>
electronic device enabling use of a micro-coaxial cable assembly in a space of a height of<br>
3 mm or less, and a wiring harness used as such a wiring member in the electronic device.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
Hereafter, the present invention will be described in detail by explaining<br>
embodiments of the invention with reference to the attached drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 is a perspective view showing an electronic device of an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention. FIGS. 2A-C illustrate an exemplary embodiment<br>
of a harness for wiring electronic devices (hereafter, simply referred to as "harness")<br>
employed in this electronic device 11. FIG. 2A is a front view, FIG. 2B is a cross-<br>
sectional view along portion A-A' in FIG. 2A, and FIG. 2C is a cross-sectional view of<br>
cables constituting the portion shown in FIG. 2B. In these figures, the symbol 10 denotes<br>
the enclosure sliding direction, 11 denotes the sliding-type electronic device, 12 denotes<br>
the first enclosure, 13 denotes the second enclosure, 14 denotes the harness wiring<br>
position, 15A denotes a first connection portion on the enclosure side, 1SB denotes a first<br>
connection portion on the harness side, 16A denotes a second connection portion on the<br>
enclosure side, 16B is a second connection portion on the harness side, 17 denotes the<br>
harness, 18 denotes a flat cable, 19 denotes a micro-coaxial cable, and 20 denotes a resin<br>
covering member (hereafter called a "sheath").<br>
The electronic device 11 of an exemplary embodiment is characterized in that two<br>
enclosures 12 and 13 having circuits are slidably mounted, and the circuits within these<br>
enclosures 12 and 13 axe electrically connected by a harness 17. The harness 17 has<br>
connection portions 15B and 16B at both ends of a tape-shape flat cable 18 obtained by<br>
arranging numerous micro-coaxial cables 19 parallel in a row and covering together with<br>
a covering 20. The connection portions 15A and 16A of the enclosures with the harness<br><br>
Further, in the electronic device 11 of this embodiment, the connection portions<br>
15Aand 16A of the enclosures 12 and 13 for connection with the harness are placed in a<br>
position such that the line connecting these connection portions 15A and 16A is not<br>
parallel with the enclosure displacement direction 10. Thus, when the connection<br>
portions 15B and 16B of the harness 17 shown in FIGS. 2A-C are connected to<br>
connection portions 15 A and 16 A, the harness 17 is placed in the harness wiring position<br>
14 shown in FIG. 1 and the enclosures are electrically connected. When the enclosure 13<br>
is slid, the micro-coaxial cables 18 of the harness 17 can be flexed with a radius of<br>
curvature larger than in the case of the wiring pattern in FIG. 15.<br>
In the wiring pattern shown in FIG. 15, the enclosure displacement direction 10<br>
and the line connecting the connection portions 8,9 are parallel, so that when the harness<br>
is wired and the enclosures are slid, the cable radius of the curvature is limited by the<br>
space between the enclosures. If this space is small, however, the harness cannot be<br>
flexed.<br>
On the other hand, in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention shown<br>
in FIG. 1, the harness 17 is placed in the harness wiring position 14 shown in FIG. 1, so<br>
that the micro-coaxial cables 18 of the harness 17 are placed in a U-shape at the<br>
displacement surface (hereafter called the "sliding surface"), and flexing with a large<br>
radius of curvature is possible upon enclosure sliding.<br>
As a result, in the sliding-type electronic device 11 of this embodiment, a micro-<br>
coaxial cable harness can be used in a space with a height of 3 mm or less.<br>
In this way, an exemplary embodiment of the present invention enables use of a<br>
micro-coaxial cable assembly, so that compared with devices using a conventional FPC<br>
as a wiring member between enclosures, transmission characteristics and noise resistance<br>
can be improved.<br><br>
Further, by performing wiring between enclosures using a harness 17 having flat<br>
cables 18, obtained by arranging numerous micro-coaxial cables 19 in parallel in a row in<br>
tape form and covering the cables together, wire breaking due to friction between cables<br>
can be eliminated.<br>
FIG. 3A is a front view of a harness 21 of an exemplary embodiment of the<br>
present invention, in which a plurality of flat cables 18 are stacked. FIG. 3B is a<br>
perspective view, and FIG. 3C is a cross-sectional view along line B-B' in FIG. 3A. FIG.<br>
4A is a cross-sectional view of a flat cable 18, and FIG. 4B is a perspective view of a<br>
connection portion of a connector 22. Further, FIG. 5 illustrates a harness in which flat<br>
cables of equal length are employed, and FIGS. 6A-C illustrate the sliding wiring shapes<br>
of a harness in which flat cables of equal length are employed. FIG. 7 illustrates a<br>
harness in which flat cables of different lengths are employed, and FIGS. 8A-D illustrate<br>
the sliding wiring shapes of a harness in which flat cables of different lengths are<br>
employed. FIG. 9 is a plane view showing the state in which a harness 21 is used to wire<br>
enclosures in a sliding-type electronic device 30.<br>
Similarly to FIG. 1 and FIGS. 2A-C, these figures are provided to explain the<br>
configuration of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, and the sizes,<br>
thicknesses, dimensions and the like of the portions shown may be different from the<br>
dimensional relationships of actual harnesses and sliding-type electronic devices.<br>
As shown in FIG. 9, the electronic device 30 of this embodiment is configured<br>
principally comprising two enclosures 28 and 29, having circuits, and a harness 21<br>
comprising a plurality of layers of flat cables 18. The two enclosures 28 and 29 are<br>
slidably mounted, and each has connector connection portions (not shown). Connectors<br>
(not shown) are connected at both ends of the harness 21.<br><br>
Further, one of the connectors of the harness 21 is connected to the connector<br>
connection portion of enclosure 29. The harness 21 is drawn out from an aperture<br>
portion provided in enclosure 28 and is bent into a U-shape at the sliding surface of the<br>
enclosures 28 and 29. The other connector is connected to the connector connection<br>
portion of the enclosure 28. Thus, the two enclosures 28 and 29 are electrically<br>
connected. Below, the configuration of each portion is explained in detail.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B, the harness 21 is configured from a plurality<br>
of flat cables 18, and a pair of connectors 22 mounted on the end portions of the plurality<br>
of flat cables 18. Near the connection portions of the connectors 22 of the harness 21, the<br>
distances between adjacent flat cables 18 are comparatively broad. Conversely, at a<br>
distance from the connection portions of the connectors 22, the distances between<br>
adjacent flat cables 18 are comparatively narrow. FIG. 3C shows that the flat cables are<br>
in a state of being stacked, with partial contact between the flat surfaces. The flat cables<br>
18 are in the same order near connection portions of connectors 22 as portions in the<br>
stacked state, without adjacent cables crossing each other. The harness 21 has flexibility<br>
in the flat directions of the flat cables 18, and can be flexed smoothly in the stacked<br>
portion of the flat cables 18 as well.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4A, the flat cables 18 are obtained by arranging four micro-<br>
coaxial cables 19 in parallel in a row, and covering with a covering member (sheath) 20<br>
to obtain a flat cable. In this embodiment, the number of micro-coaxial cables is not<br>
limited to four, but can be selected freely according to the relation between the distance<br>
(height) between enclosures and the size (thickness) of the micro-coaxial cables.<br>
Further, in this embodiment a configuration is shown in which only micro-coaxial<br>
cables 19 are used, However, the configuration of this embodiment is not limited thereto,<br><br>
and electrical feed wires, optical cables, and other cables other than coaxial cables may<br>
be combined with micro-coaxial cables to form a harness.<br>
A micro-coaxial cable 19 comprises a central conductor, an inner insulating layer<br>
24 surrounding the conductor, an outer conductor 25 surrounding this layer, and an outer<br>
covering (jacket) 26 surrounding the outer conductor. No limitations in particular are<br>
placed on the combination of the type of micro-coaxial cables 19 used and the direction<br>
of winding of the outer conductor. However, cable in which the size of the central<br>
conductor 23 is AWG 36 (American Wire Gauge) or smaller may be used, and cable<br>
which is AWG 42 or smaller may also be used.<br>
Further, no limitations in particular are placed on the material of the inner<br>
insulating layer 24, but a fluoride resin may be used, and PFA (tetrafluoro<br>
ethylene/perfmoroalkyl vinyl ether copolymer, melting point 300CC) may also be used.<br>
Also, no limitations in particular are placed on the material of the outer covering 26, but a<br>
fluoride resin may be used, and PFA or ETFE (ethylene/tetrafluoro ethylene copolymer,<br>
melting point 260°C) may also be used.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4A, the sheath 20 has a cross-section in an oval shape. The<br>
outer surfaces 20 A and inner surfaces 20B of the pair of straight portions are both flat,<br>
and the cable shapes of the micro-coaxial cables 19 are not transferred thereto. At the<br>
contact portions 19a between mutually contacting adjacent micro-coaxial cables 19, there<br>
is no fusion between the outer coverings 26.<br>
The sheath 20 constrains the micro-coaxial cables 19, and limits crossing of<br>
adjacent cables and other displacement. Also, at contact portions 20a of the sheath 20<br>
with micro-coaxial cables 19, the cables and sheath 20 are in contact, but there is no<br>
fusion of resin members to each other.<br><br>
In this embodiment, no resin of the sheath 20 or other material is used to fill a<br>
space between the sheath 20 and micro-coaxial cables 19, and gaps 27 exist. However,<br>
the configuration is not limited to that of this embodiment, and the space may be filled<br>
with a resin or other material which improves flexibility or flexing durability.<br>
No limitations in particular are placed on the material of the sheath 20, but an<br>
ultraviolet-curing resin, fluoride resin, or similar may be used. Also ETFE (melting point<br>
225°C) may be used. A fluoride resin may be used due to the ease with which such a<br>
member can be formed into a thin shape. Also, such a material may be used due to the<br>
small friction resistance between the outer peripheral surface 20A and inner peripheral<br>
surface 20B of the sheath 20, so that flexibility of the stacked portion of a flat cable 18 is<br>
not impeded.<br>
Table 1 shows the results of comparison of the characteristics of PFA and ETFE,<br>
As shown in Table 1, compared with PFA, ETFE has superior tensile strength and tensile<br>
elongation, and so the cable mechanical characteristics are improved compared with<br>
cases in which PFA is used as the sheath material.<br>
No limitations in particular are placed on the method of coverage with the sheath<br>
20, but four micro-coaxial cables 19 may be arranged in a row, and covered together by<br>
extrusion molding. Thus, a flat cable of micro-coaxial cables, which in the related art<br>
had been difficult to produce, can be obtained. No limitations in particular are placed on<br>
the thickness of the sheath 20, but a thickness in the range 10 to 50 um may be used, and<br>
a thickness in the range 20 to 3 0 um may also be used. If the thickness of the sheath 20<br>
is in the range 10 to 50 fim, adequate flexibility of the flat cable 18 can be secured.<br><br><br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the difference in melting<br>
points between the resin used in the sheath 20 and the resin used in the outer covering 26<br>
may be 30°C or greater, and the difference may also be 50eC or greater. If the melting<br>
point difference is 30°C or greater, a C02 laser or similar can be used in selective<br>
ablation of only the sheath 20 as shown in FIG. 4B, where the sheath 20 alone can be<br>
ablated and removed without causing fusion at the contact portion 20a between the<br>
sheath 20 and the outer covering 26. When ETFE is used in the sheath 20, ablation of the<br>
sheath 20 is possible even when the C02 laser output is low, and so use of this material<br>
may be used from the standpoints of safety during operation and reduction of costs.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4B, an exemplary embodiment of the present invention at<br>
contact portions between a connector 22 and flat cable 18, the sheath 20 is removed and<br>
the micro-coaxial cables 19 are exposed. Hence each individual cable can move easily,<br>
and wiring is possible to accommodate wiring intervals to the terminal pitch of the<br>
connector 22. The exposed portion of the micro-coaxial cables 19 may be approximately<br>
3 mm in length, that this portion may be more easily bent than the flat cable portion 18,<br>
and that by bending the exposed portions through 90°, the direction of arrangement of<br>
micro-coaxial cables 19 in the connector 22, and the direction of arrangement of micro-<br>
coaxial cables 19 in the flat cables 18 in the stacked portions of the flat cables 18, can be<br>
made different by 90°. Further, flat cables 18 which are adjacent in positions separated<br>
from the vicinity of the connector 22 are in a stacked state such that the outer surfaces<br>
20A of the sheaths 20 are superposed, as shown in exemplary embodiment in FIG. 3C.<br><br>
Consequently, there is no need to secure a flexing radius in the height direction as in the<br>
case of a pair of enclosures of the related art as shown in FIG. 14, and the flexing radius<br>
of the stacked portion of flat cables 18 at the sliding surface of the enclosures can be<br>
made sufficiently larger than the allowable bending radius.<br>
As shown in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention in FIG. 5, a<br>
plurality of flat cables 18 of equal length may be used in the harness 21, or, as shown in<br>
an exemplary embodiment in FIG. 7, a plurality of flat cables 18 of unequal lengths may<br>
be used. Hence when applying a harness 21 to enclosures with a sliding-type<br>
construction, equal wiring lengths of the flat cables 18, or modified lengths, may be<br>
selected as appropriate according to the position and orientation of the connector<br>
connection portions. As shown in FIGS. 6A-C and FIGS. 8A-D, the stacked portion of<br>
the flat cables 18 can be bent into a U shape, and a sliding wiring shape can be adopted<br>
which accommodates the combination of the draw-out directions of the pair of<br>
connectors 22.<br>
As shown in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention in FIG. 9, when<br>
wiring the harness 21 within enclosures of a sliding-type electronic device 30, either a<br>
plurality of flat cables 18 of equal length, or a plurality of flat cables 18 of unequal<br>
lengths, are selected for use in the harness 21, depending on the directions of the<br>
connector connection portions (not shown) in the enclosures 28 and 29. The connector<br>
22 at one end of the harness 21 is mounted on the connector connection portion (not<br>
shown) of enclosure 29. The wires are drawn out from an aperture portion of the<br>
enclosure 28, and the stacked portion of the flat cables 18 constituting the harness 21 are<br>
positioned, bent into a U shape, at the sliding surface, the width direction of which is<br>
stipulated by the inner wall (not shown) of the enclosure 29 and the inner wall 28A of the<br>
enclosure 28. The connector 22 at the other end of the harness 21 is mounted on the<br><br>
connector connection portion (not shown) of the enclosure 28. Thus, when the enclosure<br>
29 is slid relative to the enclosure 28, the stacked portion of the flat cables 18 can flex<br>
with a large bending radius equal to or greater than the allowed bending radius.<br>
FIG. 10 is a plane view showing in order the change in shape of the stacked<br>
portion of flat cables 18 during enclosure sliding of the electronic device 30. FIG. 10(a)<br>
illustrates a state in which enclosure 29 overlaps enclosure 28. FIG. 10(b) and FIG. 10(c)<br>
illustrate states in which enclosure 29 is gradually pulled out from enclosure 28, and FIG.<br>
10(d) illustrates a state in which enclosure 29 is completely pulled out from enclosure 28.<br>
FIG. 10(e) and FIG- 10(f) illustrate states in which enclosure 29 is pushed back to<br>
enclosure 28, to finally return once again to FIG. 10(a).<br>
In the electronic device 30 of this embodiment, the stacked portion of the flat<br>
cables 18 is positioned, bent into a U shape, at the sliding surface of the enclosure 28 and<br>
enclosure 29, so that the portion of the stacked portion of the flat cables 18 which is bent<br>
into a U shape is gradually displaced according to the sliding of enclosure 29 relative to<br>
enclosure 28. Hence there is no occurrence of bending at radii smaller than the allowed<br>
bending radius of the cables in the width direction stipulated by the inner wall (not shown)<br>
of enclosure 29 and the inner wall 28A of enclosure 28.<br>
As previously explained, by means of the electronic device 30 of an exemplary<br>
embodiment, advantageous effects similar to those of the above-described electronic<br>
devices of the an exemplary embodiment can be obtained.<br>
Further, to address the constraint of the height between enclosures, the ■width of<br>
the flat cables can be adjusted by selecting the diameters and number of the micro-<br>
coaxial cables, and a plurality of flat cables can be stacked and arranged in a row.<br>
Consequently in wiring of 40 conductors used in ordinary portable telephones, by<br><br>
forming flat cables of wiring and stacking fiat cables, it is possible to maintain the wiring<br>
oider, and accommodation in the space of a height of 3 nun of the enclosures is possible.<br>
Further, by using a harness 21 in which a plurality of layers of flat cables 18 are<br>
in a stacked state, the direction of arrangement in a row of micro-coaxial cables at a<br>
conductor, and the direction of arrangement in a row within the flat cables, can be<br>
changed by 90°, so that the stacked portion of the flat cables 18 can be positioned in a<br>
state of being bent into a U shape on the enclosure sliding surface. Hence when sliding<br>
an enclosure, there is no need for the stacked portion of flat cables to be flexed in the<br>
space which is 3 mm in the height direction of the enclosures, as in the wiring pattern of<br>
FIG. 14. , and flexing is possible with a large radius of curvature equal to or greater than<br>
the allowable bending radius of 5 mm in the enclosure width direction. As a result, the<br>
100,000 or more flexing cycles required for portable telephones can be satisfied.<br>
Moreover, by arranging a plurality of micro-coaxial cables in a row, and using<br>
extrusion molding to cover the cables together, a flat cable of micro-coaxial cables can be<br>
formed. Hence a micro-coaxial cable assembly is made possible, and compared with<br>
cases of the related art in which FPCs are used as wiring members between enclosures,<br>
transmission characteristics and noise resistance can be improved.<br>
Also, by using a fluoride resin in the outer covering 26 and the sheath 20 of the<br>
micro-coaxial cables 19, slipping is improved at the contact portions 19a between micro-<br>
coaxial cables 19 and at contact portions 20a between micro-coaxial cables 19 and sheath<br>
20, so that flexibility of the flat cable 18 as a whole can be improved.<br>
Further, because the outer surfaces 20A and inner surfaces 20B of the sheaths 20<br>
are planar and flat, flexibility of individual flat cables 18 can be improved, and moreover<br>
flexibility of a plurality of stacked flat cables 18 can be improved.<br><br>
Also, by using in the sheath 20 a resin having a lower melting point than the resin<br>
used in the outer covering 26 of the micro-coaxial cables 19, a C02 laser can be used in<br>
ablation of only the sheath 20. The sheath 20 can easily be ablated and removed, and the<br>
micro-coaxial cables 19 can be exposed, so that connection to a connector 22 can easily<br>
be performed, and wires can easily be twisted.<br>
FIG. 1 lis a schematic cross-sectional view of a flat cable constituting a harness<br>
of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The sizes, thicknesses, and other<br>
dimensions of each portion shown may be different from the dimensional relationships of<br>
actual harnesses.<br>
In this embodiment, the construction of flat cables 32 constituting the harness of<br>
the present invention (not shown) is different from the construction of the flat cables in<br>
the previously described embodiments; otherwise the configuration of the harness and of<br>
the sliding-type electronic device is the same as in the previous embodiment. Hence the<br>
flat cables 32 of this embodiment are explained in detail below, and explanations of<br>
portions which are the same as in the previous embodiment are omitted.<br>
FIG. 11 shows an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, where the flat<br>
cables 32 are formed by arranging four micro-coaxial cables 19 in parallel in a row, and<br>
enclosing the cables from both sides with resin tape 33 to form a flat cable. In this<br>
embodiment also, similarly to the second embodiment, the number of micro-coaxial<br>
cables is not limited to four, but can be freely selected.<br>
A resin tape 33 comprises resin film 34 and adhesive material 35. The resin film<br>
34 has a flat cross-sectional shape, and the outer surfaces 34A and inner surfaces 34B of<br>
both sides of linear portions are all flat. The cable shapes of the micro-coaxial cables 19<br>
are not transferred to the resin film 34. The adhesive material 35 fills the gap between<br>
the resin films 34 and the micro-coaxial cables 19, so that the micro-coaxial cables 19 are<br><br>
constrained, and cannot cross over adjacent cables. Also, the resin films 34 and micro-<br>
coaxial cables 19 are bonded together by the adhesive material 35. The outsidesof the<br>
micro-coaxial cables 19 positioned on both ends are not covered by resin films 34, and<br>
the outside is filled only with the adhesive material 35.<br>
No limitations in particular are placed on the material of the resin films 34; and<br>
PET or another general-purpose resin can be employed. A resin with excellent bending<br>
characteristics may be employed. No limitations in particular are placed on the thickness<br>
of the resin films, but a thickness in the range of 12 to 50 urn may be used.<br>
No limitations in particular are placed on the adhesive material 35. However, in<br>
order to secure adhesion with the fluoride resin used in the outer covering 26 of the<br>
micro-coaxial cables 19, use of a silicon-based adhesive material or similar may be used.<br>
Also, use of a resin or similar which improves the flexibility and flexing resistance of the<br>
flat cables 32 may be used. No limitations in particular are placed on the thickness of the<br>
adhesive material 35, but a thickness in the range 10 to 30 um may be used.<br>
No limitations in particular are placed on the method used for covering with resin<br>
tape 33, but four micro-coaxial cables 19 may be arranged in a row, and lamination be<br>
used to cover the cables together. Thus, fabrication of a flat cable of micro-coaxial<br>
cables, which had been difficult in the related art, can be performed. No limitations in<br>
particular are placed on the overall thickness of the resin tape 33, but a thickness in the<br>
range 20 to 80 um may be used, and a thickness in the range 30 to 50 \ixa may also be<br>
used. If the overall thickness of the resin tape 33 is between 30 and 50 um, then<br>
adequate flexibility can be secured for the flat cables 32.<br>
As previously explained, by means of a harness and a sliding-type electronic<br>
device using the flat cables 32 of this embodiment, advantageous effects similar to those<br>
of the previously described embodiments can be obtained.<br><br>
FIG. 12A is a perspective view of a flat cable 36 constituting a harness of this<br>
embodiment, and FIG. 12B is a cross-sectional view along line C-C in FIG. 12A. The<br>
sizes, thicknesses, and other dimensions of each portion shown may be different from the<br>
dimensional relationships of actual harnesses.<br>
In this embodiment, the construction of a flat cable 36 constituting the harness<br>
(not shown) differs from the construction of the flat cables of the previously described<br>
embodiments; otherwise the configurations of the harness and sliding-type electronic<br>
devices are the same as in the previous embodiments. Hence details of the flat cable 36<br>
of this embodiment are explained below, and explanations of portions which are the same<br>
as in the second embodiment are omitted.<br>
As shown in FIG. 12B, the flat cable 36 is formed by arranging four micro-<br>
coaxial cables 19 in a parallel row, and weaving binding fibers (hereafter called the<br>
"weft") 38 among the micro-coaxial cables, to obtain a flat cable. In this embodiment,<br>
similarly to the previous embodiments, no limitations in particular are placed on the<br>
number of micro-coaxial cables, which can be freely selected.<br>
In weaving the weft 38 to obtain a flat cable, the plurality of micro-coaxial cables<br>
19, arranged in a parallel row, are taken to be the warp, and the weft 38 is woven<br>
therewith. Hence at the surface of the flat cable 36 the micro-coaxial cables 19 and the<br>
weft 38 occur in alternation above and below, and the surface is not flat. Further, the<br>
micro-coaxial cables 19 are constrained by the weft 38, so that crossing over adjacent<br>
cables is not possible. Further, a wraparound fiber 37 is placed at one end of the plurality<br>
of micro-coaxial cables arranged in a parallel row. and by wrapping the weft 38 around<br>
this wraparound fiber, the micro-coaxial cables 19 formed into a flat cable do not become<br>
loose even if a weft thread breaks.<br><br>
No limitations in particular are placed on the material of the weft 38 and<br>
wraparound fiber 37, but polyester or another resin thread may be used, and a resin with<br>
excellent wear resistance and durability may be used. No limitations in particular are<br>
placed on the diameter of the resin threads, but a diameter in the range 0.1 to 0.15 µm<br>
may be used.<br>
No limitations in particular are placed on the method of weaving of the resin<br>
threads, but a commercial cable fiber may be used, and that, using polyester resin,<br>
' polyester resin thread be employed in weft wraparound method weaving. Thus, flat cable<br>
fabrication from micro-coaxial cables, which could not be performed easily and<br>
inexpensively in the related art, becomes possible, and adequate flexibility can be secured<br>
for the flat cables 36.<br>
As previously explained, by means of a harness and a sUding-type electronic<br>
device using the flat cable 36 of this embodiment, advantageous effects similar to those<br>
of the above-described embodiments may be obtained.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Below, embodiments are employed to further clarify advantageous effects of the<br>
invention. The present invention is not limited to the following embodiments, and<br>
appropriate modifications can be made without changing the sprit thereof.<br>
Example 1<br>
AWG 46 micro-coaxial cables with an outer diameter of 0.24 mm were used.<br>
Four cables were arranged in a parallel row, and the extrusion method was used to cover<br>
the cables together with a fluoride resin. A flat cable with the construction shown in FIG.<br>
2B was fabricated. The dimensions of this flat cable were 1.2 mm width, 0.3 mm<br>
thickness, for space conservation.<br><br>
A cable of a length of 80 mm was connected to connection portions (connectors),<br>
to fabricate a harness with the construction shown in FIG. 2A.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, in this harness, each of the connectors was wired while being<br>
shifted 12.4 mm in the direction perpendicular to the enclosure sliding direction. The<br>
cable bending radius at this time was 5 mm or greater. The cable accommodation height<br>
of the sliding portion was 3 mm.<br>
In this state, the enclosures were slid continuously, the cable was flexed, and the<br>
number of sliding cycles until wire breaking was investigated. Sliding tests were<br>
conducted under the conditions of a sliding interval of 30 mm and a speed of 30<br>
cycles/minute.<br>
As a result, no cable breakage occurred in the harness of this embodiment even<br>
when 100,000 or more sliding cycles were performed.<br>
Example 2<br>
The flat cables fabricated in Example 1 were stacked in 10 layers, to fabricate a<br>
harness employing 40 cores, used in ordinary portable telephones.<br>
The harness obtained had a height a in FIG. 3C of 3 mm and a width b in FIG. 3C<br>
of 1.2 mm.<br>
Similarly to Example 1, this harness was wired while each of the connectors was<br>
shifted 12.4 mm in the direction perpendicular to the enclosure sliding direction. The flat<br>
cable stacked portion of the harness was bent into a U shape at the sliding surface and<br>
wired, as shown in FIG. 9; the cable radius of curvature at this time was 5 mm or greater.<br>
Sliding tests similar to those of Example 1 were conducted for this wiring state.<br>
As a result, no cable breakage occurred in the harness of this embodiment even<br>
when 100,000 or more sliding cycles were performed.<br>
Example 3<br><br>
AWG 46 micro-coaxial cables with an external diameter of 0.24 mm were used.<br>
As the laminating tape, a PET (polyethylene terephthalate) tape with a silicon-based<br>
adhesive was used. Four of the cables were arranged in parallel in a row, and a<br>
lamination method was used to cover the cables together, to fabricate flat cables with the<br>
construction shown in FIG. 11. The dimensions of the flat cables were 1.2 mm wide and<br>
0.37 mm thick, for space conservation.<br>
Flat cables thus fabricated were stacked in 10 layers, to fabricate a harness<br>
employing 40 cores, used in ordinary portable telephones.<br>
The harness obtained had a height a in FIG. 3C of 4 mm and a width b in FIG. 3C<br>
of 1.2 mm.<br>
Similarly to Example 1, this harness was wired while each of the connectors was<br>
shifted 12.4 mm in the direction perpendicular to the enclosure sliding direction. The flat<br>
cable stacked portion of the harness was bent into a U shape at the sliding surface and<br>
wired, as shown in FIG. 9; the cable radius of curvature at this time was 5 mm or greater.<br>
Sliding tests similar to those of Example 1 were conducted for this wiring state.<br>
As a result, no cable breakage occurred in the harness of this embodiment even<br>
when 100,000 or more sliding cycles were performed.<br>
Example 4<br>
AWG 46 micro-coaxial cables with an external diameter of 0.24 mm were used.<br>
As the weft fibers, 50-denier polyester fibers were used. Four of the cables were<br>
arranged in parallel in a row, a wraparound fiber was also placed in parallel at one end of<br>
the cables, and the weft fibers were woven with the cables, to fabricate flat cables with<br>
the construction shown in FIG. 12. The dimensions of the flat cables were 2.25 mm wide<br>
and 0.6 mm thick, for space conservation.<br><br>
Flat cables thus fabricated were stacked in 10 layers, to fabricate a harness<br>
employing 40 cores, used in ordinary portable telephones.<br>
The harness obtained had a height a in FIG- 3C of 6 mm and a width b in FIG. 3C<br>
of 2.25 mm.<br>
Similarly to Example 1, this harness was wired while each of the connectors was<br>
shifted 12.4 mm in the direction perpendicular to the enclosure sliding direction. The flat<br>
cable stacked portion of the harness was bent into a U shape at the sliding surface and<br>
wired, as shown in FIG- 9; the cable radius of curvature at this time was 5 mm or greater.<br>
Sliding tests similar to those of Example 1 were conducted for this wiring state.<br>
As a result, no cable breakage occurred in the harness of this embodiment even<br>
when 100,000 or more sliding cycles were performed.<br>
Comparative Example<br>
AWG 46 micro-coaxial cables with an external diameter of 0.24 mm were used.<br>
40 cores were arranged in parallel in a row, and were taped to fabricate a flat cable; and<br>
as shown in FIG. 8, wiring was performed such that the line connecting the connectors<br>
was parallel to the enclosure sliding direction. The cables of the harness were flexed<br>
within the cable accommodation height (3 ram) of the sliding portion, and the cable<br>
radius of curvature at this time was 1.5 mm.<br>
In this state, sliding tests similar to those of Example 1 were conducted. As a<br>
result, breakage of the cable of the comparative example occurred after an average (n = 3)<br>
of 11,254 cycles.<br>
While exemplary embodiments of the invention have been described and<br>
illustrated above, it should be understood that these are exemplary of the invention and<br>

An electronic device and harness for wiring electronic devices are disclosed.<br>
The invention provides an electronic device enabling use of a micro-coaxial cable<br>
assembly in a space of a height of 3 mm or less, and a wiring harness used as such a<br>
wiring member in the electronic device. The electronic device (11) comprises first and<br>
second enclosures (12, 13), an electric wire (17) having a flat cable (18) which includes<br>
a plurality of internal conductors (19). The first enclosure (12) is slidable with respect<br>
to the second enclosure (13) along a plane (10). The flat cable (18) is bent into a U<br>
shape in the plane (10). In the portion of the flat cable (18) bent into a U shape, the<br>
conductors (19) are arranged in a row and positioned along a direction substantially<br>
perpendicular to the plane (10).</td>
