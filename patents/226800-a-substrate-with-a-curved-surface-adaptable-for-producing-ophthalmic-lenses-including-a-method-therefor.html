				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for the manufacture of<br>
articles including, without limitation, ophthalmic lenses. In particular, the<br>
invention provides a method and device in which lithography is used to form<br>
mold inserts and molds useful in the manufacture of articles.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The use of ophthalmic lenses, including spectacle lenses, contact lenses,<br>
intraocular lenses, and the like for the correction of ametropia is well known.<br>
Production of the lenses using casting or molding requires the use of molds that<br>
impart the desired corrective characteristics onto the lens surfaces. Additionally,<br>
the manufacturing process may require the production of mold inserts as well.<br>
For example, in the manufacture of contact lenses metal inserts are fabricated<br>
and then used in the production of lens molds.<br>
Typically, a large inventory of molds and molds inserts is required corresponding<br>
to each sphere, add, and cylinder power, and combination thereof desired for the<br>
lens. Production and maintenance costs for the mold and mold insert inventory<br>
are high. Further, known processes for producing and using molds and mold<br>
inserts are not efficient and cost-effective methods for producing lenses<br>
customized to a particular wearer, such as a contact lens customized to a<br>
particular wearer's corneal topography.<br><br>
One method for production of lenses that attempts to eliminate the need for<br>
large inventory molds is disclosed in United States Patent No. 6,086,204. In this<br>
patent is disclosed the use of customized, heated dies, which utilize mechanical<br>
fingers, alone or in combination with a metal surface, to impart the desired<br>
corrective characteristics to a lens blank. This method is disadvantageous in that<br>
it is unsuitable for the production of uncertain ophthalmic lenses, such as soft<br>
contact lenses because soft contact lens materials are thermoset materials that<br>
cannot be deformed with heat. Additionally, this method is disadvantageous in<br>
that molding the lens material using a heated die requires that the lens blanks'<br>
optical axis be perfectly aligned with that of the die, which adds a great degree<br>
of difficulty to production of the lens. Finally, the disclosed method is not the<br>
most cost effective production method in that it is a thermal molding process.<br>
Therefore, a need exists for a method to produce lenses with a mold that<br>
permits reduction of lens inventory and which overcomes some or all of these<br>
disadvantages.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION AND ITS PREFERRED<br>
EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention provides a lithographic method for manufacturing molds,<br>
and mold inserts, for use in producing articles including, without limitation,<br>
ophthalmic lenses. In the manufacture of lenses, the invention permits the<br>
production of a full prescriptive range of lenses while reducing the number of<br>
molds and mold inserts required. Further, the methods of the invention may be<br>
used in a method for the delivery of customized lenses.<br><br>
The present invention is applicable to the molding and formation of various<br>
articles including, without limitation, lenses of various sizes. For purposes of<br>
illustration only, the examples herein may refer to ophthalmic lenses.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides a curved surface for use in molding<br>
applications comprising, consisting essentially of, and consisting of a substrate,<br>
wherein said substrate is substantially transparent to a radiation source, said<br>
substrate having a coating with a curved surface, where the curved surface is<br>
used as the mold surface and is formed by a.) depositing a radiation-curable<br>
deposit on a first surface of the substrate and b.) the deposit is developed,<br>
selectively, by passing radiation through said substrate's second surface,<br>
opposite the first surface, the radiation entering into the deposit resulting in<br>
developed deposit and undeveloped deposit, and where the curved surface is the<br>
surface of the developed deposit away from the substrate surface.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention provides a curved surface for use in<br>
molding applications comprising, consisting essentially of, and consisting of a<br>
substrate, wherein said substrate is substantially transparent to a radiation<br>
source, said substrate having a curved surface, where the curved surface is used<br>
as the mold surface and is formed by a.) depositing a radiation-curable deposit<br>
on a first surface of the substrate , b.) the deposit is developed, selectively, by<br>
passing the radiation through said substrate's second surface, opposite the first<br>
surface, the radiation entering into the deposit resulting in developed deposit<br>
and undeveloped deposit, the developed deposit forming a desired curved<br>
surface, and c.) the developed deposit is etched to form a mirror image, or<br>
replication, of the desired curved surface in the substrate resulting in the curved<br>
surface substrate.<br><br>
In yet another embodiment, the invention provides a method comprising,<br>
consisting essentially, of: a.) depositing a radiation-curable material onto at least<br>
one surface of a lens mold blank or lens mold insert blank; and b.) curing the<br>
radiation-curable material under conditions suitable to form an optical quality<br>
molding surface having optical characteristics on at least one surface of the<br>
radiation-curable material.<br>
For purposes of the invention, the term "curing" and "developing" are used<br>
interchangeably. By "radiation-curable material" is meant a photoresist or coating<br>
that is curable by light, electron beam, gamma ray, heat, radio wave, microwave<br>
and the like.<br>
For purposes of the examples in accordance with the invention, by "ophthalmic<br>
lens" is meant a spectacle lens, a contact lens, an intraocular lens, or the like. By<br>
"optical quality" is meant that the surface is sufficiently smooth so that a surface<br>
formed by the polymerization of a lens-forming material, or lens mold-forming<br>
material, in contact with the molding surface, is optically acceptable. Preferably,<br>
by "optical quality" is meant that the surface has a roughness of a RMS of less<br>
than about 100 nm, more preferably less than about 20 nm.<br>
By "lens mold blank" is meant a blank useful in forming a mold from which<br>
lenses may be molded. More specifically, in the process of the invention,<br>
radiation-curable material is deposited onto a surface of a lens mold blank and<br>
cured to form a surface on the blank which surface can be used to mold a lens<br>
surface. Similarly, by "lens mold insert blank" is meant a blank useful in forming<br>
a lens mold insert from which lens molds may be formed. By "optical<br><br>
characteristics" is meant one or more of spherical, aspheric, toric, or cylindric<br>
curvature, curvatures for the correction of aberrations of the third order or<br>
higher, and the like and combinations thereof.<br>
Curved surfaces, for use in molds in accordance with the present invention, may<br>
be formed by using light or beam sources to develop, or cure, radiation-curable<br>
materials on blanks. In one embodiment of the method of the invention, a<br>
radiation-curable material is deposited on a substrate, herein also referred to as<br>
a blank, and cured by illuminating with light passing through a gray-scale mask<br>
and the blank. The uncured portions of the coating are removed and the<br>
remaining developed portions serve as the desired surface. In an alternative<br>
method, the developed material is etched resulting in an actual etching of the<br>
blank to form the desired surface. Both methods produce surfaces that can be<br>
covered with additional coatings.<br>
In Figure 1 is generally depicted the method of developing a material in a blank.<br>
The blank 110 and radiation-curable material 120 are loaded onto a fixture that<br>
sets the position of the substrate relative to a gray-scale mask 130. This fixture<br>
preferably controls the position to at least about 10 microns and may be any<br>
suitable fixture including, without limitation, a precision x-y table. In the case in<br>
which a negative photoresist-like method is used, the material is exposed by<br>
passing illumination 150 which may, for example, be ultra-violet light, from an<br>
illumination source 140 through the gray-scale mask 130 and then through the<br>
blank 110. The illumination passes through the blank 110 and into the material<br>
120 developing the material 190 depending upon the penetration depth 170<br>
determined by gray-scale mask 130. Typically, the UV light intensity onto the<br>
gray-scale mask is about 1 m W to about 5 W and the exposure time is about 0.5<br><br>
to about 30 seconds. Developing, or curing time, will depend upon the radiation-<br>
curable material used as well as the intensity of the radiation.<br>
Curing produces a developed, a radiation-curable material 190 with a surface<br>
160 having the desired configuration. Following exposure, uncured material 180<br>
is removed. Removal may be carried out by any convenient means including,<br>
without limitation, by spinning off the uncured material, Use of a solvent such as<br>
acetone, ethanol, tetra-methyl ammonium hydroxide, methylene chloride or the<br>
like is possible, but not preferred.<br>
In a preferred method, spinning off of the uncured material is carried out under<br>
a nitrogen atmosphere and three cycles are used: one at about 200 to about 400<br>
rpm for 30 seconds; one at 700 rpm for about 30 seconds; and a third cycle at<br>
about 2000 rpm for about 120 seconds. During the final rotation, the surface 55<br>
is cured as, for example, by exposure to 16 mW/cm2 of light at 365 nm<br>
shuttering on and off at about 0.5 cycles/second. Even after removal of the<br>
uncured material, a thin layer will remain. During the third cycle of the spin<br>
process, the thin layer remaining is curing while the mold remains in motion thus<br>
polymerizing the layer while the dynamic forces are in effect.<br>
As stated above, the first step of the method of the invention, radiation-curable<br>
material is deposited onto a lens mold, or lens mold insert, blank. Preferably, the<br>
blank is transparent to light in the range of about 150 to about 500 nm. Methods<br>
for forming blanks are well known in the industry. For example, polymeric blanks<br>
may be formed by molding, casting, or the like while metal blanks may be<br>
formed using a diamond-point turning and glass blanks may be formed by<br>
grinding or polishing. The blanks may be formed of any material normally used in<br>
the semi-conductor or ophthalmic industry. Suitable materials include, without<br>
limitation, polystyrene, polymethylmethacrylates, polycarbonates,<br><br>
polyoxymethylene, propylene, polyetherimides, nylons, polyvinylchlorides, cyclic<br>
olefins, brass, nickel-coated brass, stainless steel, nickel-coated stainless steel,<br>
aluminum, and the like.<br>
In figures 2 and 3 are depicted two types of blanks useful in the method of the<br>
invention. In Figure 2A is depicted a flat-topped blank 200 having flat surface<br>
210 and base 220. In Figure 2B is depicted a flat-topped blank with a deposit<br>
230. Radiation-curable material 240 is deposited on the flat surface 210. In<br>
Figure 3A is depicted curved blank 300 with a curved surface 310 onto which, as<br>
shown in Figure 3B, radiation-curable material 340 is deposited. The deposits<br>
240 and 340 are developed by radiation into the desirable shapes by use of a<br>
radiation, or illumination, source.<br>
Radiation-curable material useful in the invention preferably is compatible with<br>
the material from which the lens, or lens mold, is to be formed. Factors for<br>
determining whether the radiation-curable material is compatible include, without<br>
limitation, whether it adheres to or chemically reacts with the lens-forming or<br>
lens mold forming material. Additionally, if the lens or the lens mold to be<br>
formed from the mold or mold insert will be cured using ultra-violet or visible<br>
light cure, the radiation-curable material preferably is transmissive of light of the<br>
appropriate wavelength. In embodiments in which a lens mold insert is being<br>
formed form the radiation-curable material and mold insert blank, the cured<br>
radiation-curable material preferably has a Shore D hardness of at least about<br>
70. Further, in embodiments in which the material is being deposited onto a lens<br>
mold blank, the cured or uncured radiation-curable material must be one suitable<br>
for depositing in a layer of between about 10 and 500 microns. Other desirable<br><br>
properties of the radiation-curable material will depend upon whether it is being<br>
used in the formation of a lens mold or a lens mold blank. In general, however,<br>
the uncured, or undeveloped, radiation-curable material preferably has a<br>
viscosity of less than about 500 cps at 25° C, a cure shrink of 
tensile strength of greater than about 750 psi, and a cured water absorption of<br>
less than about 1% by volume.<br>
Suitable commercially available materials include, without limitation, urethane<br>
acrylates, cycloaliphatic epoxies, polyurethane oligomers, hydrogenated bis-<br>
phenol A epoxies, poly (norbornene) epoxies and the like and combinations<br>
thereof.<br>
The radiation-curable material may be deposited by any convenient method that<br>
ensures that the entire blank surface is covered and that there are no voids at<br>
the interface between the blank and the material. Suitable methods of deposition<br>
depend upon whether a positive or a negative photoresist-like method is used. A<br>
"negative photoresist-like method" means that an excess of material is<br>
deposited, a portion of it is cured, and the uncured material is removed. By<br>
"positive photoresist-like method" means that the amount necessary to form the<br>
desired surface is deposited and cured. If a negative photoresist-like method is<br>
used, the material may be deposited without thickness control so long as a<br>
substantially continuous contact results between the substrate and the material.<br>
In the case in which a negative photoresist-like method is used to produce a<br>
contact lens mold or mold insert, typically about 50 mg to about 1 g of material<br>
will be deposited. If a positive photoresist-like method is used, the radiation-<br>
curable material is dispensed onto the surface in a manner so that the thickness<br>
is controlled within desired parameters. In this case, deposition is typically<br>
carried out using a spin coater.<br><br>
In the development step b.) the radiation-curable material is cured by any<br>
suitable method including, heat, light, or other radiation cure, and combinations<br>
thereof. Preferably, light at about 100 to about 800 nm from a fusion lamp,<br>
metal halide lamp, arc lamp, or the like is used. Curing may take place under any<br>
suitable conditions of temperature, pressure and time. Preferably, a cure using<br>
light in the range of about 150 to about 500 nm at room temperature and<br>
atmospheric pressure are used and curing is carried out under a nitrogen blanket<br>
for about 0.1 seconds to about 30 minutes. The specific time for completion of<br>
curing will depend upon the material selected and the thickness of the material<br>
and whether heat, light, or other radiation is used.<br>
In Figure 4 is depicted a step 400 in which a curved blank's 410 curved surface is<br>
coated with a developed radiation-curable material 430 and an undeveloped<br>
coating 420. The development of the coating is carried out in accordance with<br>
the methods described with respect to Figure 1. In Figure 4B is depicted the step<br>
440 in which the uncured coating 420 is removed and an optional coating 450<br>
placed upon the remaining developed coating 430. The radiation-curable material<br>
was deposited onto curved surface of the blank 410, which blank is transparent<br>
to the curing radiation. For example, blank, or mold blank, 410 may be<br>
transparent to UV light, which is transparent to UV light. Light from a UV light<br>
source is then passed through gray-scale mask to cure the material. The gray-<br>
scale mask is used to control the intensity of UV light impinging on the material.<br>
The desired surface profile is used as a datum, or reference surface, from which<br>
the transmission depth of the UV light into the radiation-curable material is set.<br>
By setting the transmission depth of the UV light into the radiation-curable<br>
material is set. By setting the transmission depth, desired optical characteristics<br><br>
may be imparted to surface of material. As an alternative to gray-scale mask, an<br>
electronic gray scale mask may be used, for example an array of liquid crystal<br>
display ("LCD") cells or comparable spatial light modulators.<br>
In more detail, curing using gray-scale mask is carried out as follows. In using a<br>
gray-scale mask, the object is to modulate the intensity of light that impinges<br>
onto the radiation-curable material at each point on the surface to be formed.<br>
The degree to which the light intensity is modulated will be determined by the<br>
penetration depth required for each point on the surface.<br>
Material calibration is carried out to provide the curve relating the depth to which<br>
the material will be cured to a gray-scale level, or to the incident intensity of the<br>
curing radiation on the radiation-curable material. In carrying out the material<br>
calibration, the photoresist is exposed and the uncured photoresist is removed.<br>
The shape of the resultant surface is measured by any convenient means, as for<br>
example by use of VEECO™ white light interferometer, to determine the<br>
penetration depth at each point on the cured photoresist. Since each point will<br>
correspond to a point on the gray-scale mask, this yields a calibration curve.<br>
Repeating the procedure yields a curve with estimates of the penetration depth<br>
variances.<br>
One ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize that the use of a gray-scale mask is<br>
only one way in which to modulate the light intensity. Alternatively, modulation<br>
may be carried out using a adaptive mirror to generate a wavefront the intensity<br>
of which is modulated across its surface, using a bundle a fiber optics to<br>
generate a spatially modulated intensity of light, and using a discrete array of<br>
mirrors to deflect the light.<br><br>
A gray-scale mask may be made by any convenient method. For example, and<br>
without limitation, the gray scale mask may be formed by printing differing levels<br>
of gray shades onto a transparency using a printer with a resolution of about 600<br>
or greater. Alternatively, an electronic gray scale mask may be formed using an<br>
array of liquid crystal displays in which the light transmission of each LCD cell<br>
can be controlled by supplying a voltage to the cell. As yet another alternative, a<br>
mask may be produced by use of direct electron beam writing according to well-<br>
known methods. Performance of printed gray scale masks may be optimized by<br>
vibrating the mask at a small amplitude and in a random direction. Alternatively,<br>
the lens residing between the mask and the substrate may be defocused. Either<br>
of these techniques acts to provide the discrete nature of the dots from which<br>
the printed mask is formed from transferring to the developing material.<br>
The gray-scale level, or radiation intensity, is based on the lens mold or lens<br>
mold insert, design, the substrate design, and the calibration curve. The mold or<br>
mold insert design determines the thickness of the material at each location on<br>
the substrate and this dictates the depth to which curing radiation is needed to<br>
penetrate the material at each location. The gray-scale level is then determined<br>
by conversion of the penetration depth information into gray-scale level<br>
information using the calibration curve.<br>
In Figure 4B is shown blank 410 after uncured or undeveloped material 420 is<br>
removed to expose surface 460 defined by developed material 430. The cured<br>
material 430, with optional coating 450, then may be used as a back curve mold<br>
half in production of a lens, surfaces 460 and 470 being used to form a surface<br>
of the lens. In such a case, surfaces 460 and 470 must be of optical quality. The<br><br>
size, shape, and thickness of cured material 430 will be dependent on the type of<br>
lens to be produced. Preferably, it is about 0.5 to about 5000 microns in<br>
thickness.<br>
As an optical step, the cured radiation-curable material may be coated 450. The<br>
material may be coated with any coating suitable to form a highly crosslinked,<br>
non-chemically reactive surface suitable for release of the lens by using standard<br>
methods and practices. The coating may be applied by any suitable method.<br>
Preferably, the resultant coating layer is about 5 to about 10 microns in<br>
thickness.<br>
In another embodiment, displayed in Figures 5A and 5B, the surface of the blank<br>
510 is etched and serves as the mold surface. Figure 5A depicts the step 500 in<br>
which a curved blank 510 is left with a developed coating 520. The developed<br>
coating 520 is etched 580. For example, the developed coating 520 may be<br>
plasma, for example HF ion, or wet etched or can be laser etched as is<br>
commonly used in semi-conductor etching. The etching method is for example<br>
purposes only and the discussion herein is not to be interpreted to limit the<br>
etching techniques.<br>
Figure 5B shows the etched mold 530 formed from the etched surface 540 of the<br>
substrate 510. The etched surface 540 will have the same optical qualities<br>
described above with respect to the developed coating surfaces 460 as discussed<br>
above.<br><br>
The mold shown in Figures 4B and 5B are back mold halves suitable for molding<br>
the back surface, or eye side surface, of a lens. For purposes of molding a lens, a<br>
complementary mold half is used. The molds of the invention may be composed<br>
of two mold halves, each of which is formed from radiation-curable material.<br>
Alternatively, one mold half may be formed from the material and the other mold<br>
half by conventional means using conventional material. The mold halves may be<br>
brought into contact for purposes of molding the lens using any suitable<br>
contacting means including, without limitation, stepper motors, screw drives, or<br>
the like, and combinations thereof. When positioned for molding of the lens, the<br>
mold halves may contact one another. In this case, preferably a sealing means is<br>
used to seal the molds so that an acceptable lens edge is formed. For example,<br>
the mold halves may be contacted so that an interference fit is formed between<br>
the halves. In this method, the back half mold is forced into the front mold half<br>
so that a seal forms. Additional suitable sealing means include, without<br>
limitation, a mechanical inter-lock, a gasket, o-ring, and the like, and<br>
combinations thereof. If the mold halves do not contact each other, preferably a<br>
mask is used to expose only those areas at which polymerization is desired. The<br>
mold halves and molds of the invention may be supported by any suitable<br>
means. Supporting means including, without limitation, a pallet, a support frame,<br>
or the like, and combinations thereof.<br>
In a preferred method of forming lenses, a lens-forming material may be<br>
deposited on the molding surface by any suitable means. The volume of lens-<br>
forming material dispensed into the cavity will be a lens forming amount which is<br>
an amount effective to form the desired ophthalmic lens. Typically, the amount<br>
of material deposited will be about 0.01 mg to about 1000 g.<br><br>
Suitable lens-forming materials for lenses such as contact lenses are any<br>
materials useful for forming hard or soft contact lenses. For example, the lens<br>
forming material may be suitable for forming a soft contact lenses. Illustrative<br>
materials for formation of soft contact lenses include, without limitation silicone<br>
elastomers, silicone-containing macromers including without limitation, those<br>
disclosed in United States Patent Numbers 5,371,147, 5,314,960, and, 5,057,578<br>
incorporated in their entireties herein by reference, hydrogels, silicone-containing<br>
hydrogels, and the like and combinations thereof. More preferably, the surface is<br>
a siloxane, or contains a siloxane functionality, including, without limitation,<br>
polydimethyl siloxane macromers, methacryloxypropyl polyalkyl siloxanes, and<br>
mixtures thereof, silicone hydrogel or a hydrogel, such as etafilcon A.<br>
A preferred lens-forming material is a poly 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate<br>
polymers, meaning having a peak molecular weight between about 25,000 and<br>
about 80,000 and a polydispersity of less than about 1.5 to less than about 3.5<br>
respectively and covalently bonded thereon, at least one cross-linkable functional<br>
group. This material is described in Attorney Docket Number VTN 588, United<br>
States Serial No. 60/363,630 incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.<br>
As yet another alternative, the lens-forming material may be any material<br>
suitable for forming ophthalmic lens other than contact lenses. For example,<br>
spectacle lens-forming materials may be used including, without limitation,<br>
polycarbonates, such as bisphenol A polycarbonates, allyl diglycol carbonates,<br>
such as diethylene glycol bisallyl carbonate (CR-39™), allylic esters, such as<br>
triallyl cyanurate, triallyl phosphate and triallyl citrate, acrylic esters, acrylates,<br>
methacrylates, such as methyl-ethyl-and butyl methacrylates and acrylates,<br>
styrenics, polyesters, and the like and combinations thereof.<br><br>
Suitable materials for forming intraocular lenses include, without limitation,<br>
polymethyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, inert clear plastics, silicone-<br>
based polymers, and the like and combinations thereof.<br>
Curing of the lens forming material deposited within the mold may be carried out<br>
by any means known including, without limitation, thermal, irradiation, chemical,<br>
electromagnetic radiation curing and the like and combinations thereof.<br>
Preferably, molding is carried out using ultraviolet light or using the full spectrum<br>
of visible light. More specifically, the precise conditions suitable for curing the<br>
lens-forming material will depend on the material selected and the lens to be<br>
formed.<br>
Polymerization processes for contact lenses are well known. Suitable processes<br>
are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,540,410 incorporated herein is its entirety by<br>
reference. For formation of contact lenses, a preferred curing condition is to pre-<br>
cure the mold assembly using UV light with an intensity of about 2 to about<br>
10mW/cm2. Suitable wavelengths are about 300 to about 500 nm. The time for<br>
the low intensity exposure will depend on the lens-material selected, the type<br>
and amount of any initiator used, material viscosity and the nature of its reactive<br>
groups, and the intensity of the UV light. Both pre-cure and subsequent UV<br>
exposure may, and preferably are, carried out as single, continuous exposures.<br>
However, the exposures also may be carried out using alternating periods of UV<br>
exposure and non-exposure periods. The polymerization steps preferably is<br>
carried out at a temperature between about 40 to about 75°C and atmospheric<br>
pressure preferably under a blanket of nitrogen gas. Total cure time is between<br>
about 300 to about 500 seconds.<br><br>
In an embodiment in which the poly 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate polymers<br>
having a peak molecular weight between about 25,000 and about 80,000 and a<br>
polydispersity of less than about 1.5 to less than about 3.5 are used, preferably<br>
UVA (about 315 - about 400 nm), UVB (about 280-about 315) or visible light<br>
(about 400-about 450 nm), at an intensity of about 100mW/cm2 to about<br>
50,000mW/cm2 is used. The cure time will be generally less than about 30<br>
seconds and preferably less than about 10 second at about ambient<br>
temperature. Regardless of the polymerization method selected, the precise<br>
conditions will depend upon the components of lens material selected and are<br>
within the skill of one ordinary skill in the art to determine.<br>
The invention will be clarified further by a consideration of the following non-<br>
limiting example.<br>
Example<br>
Two concave glass mold half blanks were coated with approximately 1 ml of<br>
Norland Optical #72 epoxy, which was dispensed into each of the mold halves.<br>
Curing was carried out for one of the mold half blanks for 5 seconds using<br>
radiation at 20mW/cm2 and the other for 20 seconds at 80 mW/cm2 of UV light<br>
(356 nm) both at room temperature. Excess epoxy was removed by spinning the<br>
mold halves according to the spin profile set forth in Table 1. During the final<br>
spin cycle, the outer surface of the epoxy layer was cured by exposure to 10 to<br>
20 mW/cm2 of UV light (356 nm) at room temperature.<br><br><br>
The resulting cured epoxy surfaces of the first and second mold halves had a<br>
RMS of 28 nm and 26 nm, respectively.<br>
Many variations in the design and method of creating molds for the manufacture<br>
of lenses may be realized in accordance with the present invention. It will be<br>
obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to vary the invention thus described.<br>
Such variations are not to be regarded as departures from the spirit and scope of<br>
the invention and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the<br>
art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims.<br><br>
